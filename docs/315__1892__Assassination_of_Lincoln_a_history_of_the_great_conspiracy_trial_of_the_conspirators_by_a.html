<p>EXPLANATION.
</p>
<p>IT is perhaps necessary that the author should explain the
</p>
<p>sense in which the term, " Great Conspiracy," in the title of his
</p>
<p>book, is used. It is not at all in the same sense in which it
</p>
<p>is used by General Logan in his book. In that it is used as
</p>
<p>the equivalent of the Great Rebellion, only that it broadly
</p>
<p>covers all that led to and culminated in the war against the
</p>
<p>government, designated as " The Rebellion." It is only here
</p>
<p>used to designate the conspiracy that resorted to the policy of
</p>
<p>assassination as a means to give aid to the rebellion ; and the
</p>
<p>reader who follows the author through will then be able to per-

<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>IT is now more than twenty-seven years since the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, an
</p>
<p>event of the greatest importance at the time, not only to the
</p>
<p>people of the United States, but to the civilized world. The
</p>
<p>trial of the conspirators by a military commission created the
</p>
<p>greatest possible interest; and the proceedings and testimony
</p>
<p>were published from day to day by all of the great newspapers
</p>
<p>of the country, and read with avidity. The judgment of those
</p>
<p>who carefully studied the testimony at the time was formed
</p>
<p>upon a competent knowledge of the facts.
</p>
<p>And yet, even then, the fate of the prisoners on trial before
</p>
<p>the Commission, to be found innocent or guilty according to the
</p>
<p>evidence, constituted the great point of interest, and thus tended
</p>
<p>to divert attention from the evidence against the other parties
</p>
<p>charged not only with being co-conspirators, but as being the
</p>
<p>instigators of the plot.
</p>
<p>Since that time a new generation has come on to the stage of
</p>
<p>action, and as the official report of the trial by Ben Pittman,
</p>
<p>published at the time, is in the hands of but comparatively few
</p>
<p>people, a concise history of this great event, in popular form,
</p>
<p>but founded on the evidence, seemed to the writer to be due
</p>
<p>and called for at the present time.
</p>
<p>The necessity for this has been emphasized by a recent re-
</p>
<p>vival of efforts that have been made from time to time, ever

<p>6 PREFACE,
</p>
<p>since the execution of the assassins that were condemned to
</p>
<p>death, to prejudice public sentiment against the government by
</p>
<p>the assumption of the innocence of one of the parties executed
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>Only a few months since (May 30, 1891), La Salle Insti-
</p>
<p>tute in New York City was crowded by an audience that came
</p>
<p>together expecting to hear Cardinal Gibbons and Father Walter
</p>
<p>review the case of Mrs. Surratt. Neither the cardinal nor the
</p>
<p>father appeared, but a Mr. Sloane arose and read to the audi-
</p>
<p>ence a letter from Father Walter on the subject. This letter
</p>
<p>contained nothing new to those who were familiar with the case
</p>
<p>at the time of its occurrence. It was substantially the same
</p>
<p>that was published over his signature shortly after her execu-
</p>
<p>tion. After stating that he was her confessor, and that his
</p>
<p>priestly vows did not permit him to reveal the secrets of the
</p>
<p>confessional, he very calmly and positively states his belief in
</p>
<p>her entire innocence, basing that belief on what he professes to
</p>
<p>know. He then relates the efforts he made to get a reprieve
</p>
<p>and a postponement of her execution for a few days, and
</p>
<p>expresses the belief that could he have succeeded in this for
</p>
<p>only ten days he could have saved her life.
</p>
<p>He then complains of the manner in which he was treated
</p>
<p>by the President, Andrew Johnson, and Judge Holt, who referred
</p>
<p>him back and forth, each to the other, and that between them
</p>
<p>he could get nothing accomplished.
</p>
<p>A story has also been gotten up of a Union soldier who was
</p>
<p>a member of the conspiracy and knew all of its members and
</p>
<p>secrets, who affirms the innocence of Mrs. Surratt. The most
</p>
<p>rational and, at the same time, charitable thing to be said
</p>
<p>about this story is, that this Union soldier was manufactured
</p>
<p>for the occasion.

<p>That portion of the press of to-day that inherits the old cop-
</p>
<p>PREFACE. 7
</p>
<p>per-head animus, greedily publishes all such things as these, and
</p>
<p>indulges in the wildest latitude of editorial comment and false
</p>
<p>statements. They have buried all of the members of the Com-
</p>
<p>mission but one many times ; have followed all of the princi-
</p>
<p>pal actors in the scene to violent and miserable deaths ; and have
</p>
<p>made it manifest that had the Almighty Ruler of the Universe
</p>
<p>viewed the matter in their light, and been as swift in his retri-
</p>
<p>butions as they would have had him to be, not one who had
</p>
<p>any connection with the arrest, trial, and execution of the assas-
</p>
<p>sins of the great and good President would have been left alive.
</p>
<p>They have manifested an especial venom of feeling against the
</p>
<p>then Secretary of War, Hon. E. M. Stanton, iterating and reit-
</p>
<p>erating the absurd and false statement that he died from the
</p>
<p>violence of his own hand, being crazed wirh remorse. Why they
</p>
<p>should thus select Mr. Stanton as the especial object of their
</p>
<p>hatred cannot be seen from any connection he had with this case.
</p>
<p>His part, though important and involving great responsibility,
</p>
<p>was, in fact, a very subordinate one. He selected the officers to
</p>
<p>be embraced in the order of detail for the Commission, under
</p>
<p>the order of the President, that was all. Judge Holt conducted
</p>
<p>the trial and recorded the proceedings under the President's
</p>
<p>order, and when he handed that record over to the President
</p>
<p>his connection with the case ended. President Johnson then held
</p>
<p>the temporal destiny of this woman, as well as that of all the
</p>
<p>others convicted, in his own hand. He and he alone was respon-
</p>
<p>sible.
</p>
<p>From all this it appears that the time has come when a clear,
</p>
<p>concise history of this conspiracy and trial should be given to
</p>
<p>the world. To this task the writer has addressed himself, and
</p>
<p>he offers this volume as the result of his labors. The facts
</p>
<p>herein narrated in regard to the assassination, as well as to the

</p>
<p>parts enacted by each of the individual members of the conspir-
</p>
<p>8 PREFACE.
</p>
<p>acy, are drawn from the testimony before the Commission. They
</p>
<p>have been thrown into the form of a connected narrative, and
</p>
<p>there has been nothing stated as a fact but what is fully sustained
</p>
<p>by the evidence which formed the basis of the decisions of the
</p>
<p>Commission. Nothing has been admitted into this narrative but
</p>
<p>what rests on the specific testimony of unimpeachable witnesses.
</p>
<p>The author only deems it necessary that the opinion, or belief,
</p>
<p>of Father Walter, and all others of his persuasion, shall be con-
</p>
<p>fronted by the testimony in the case, in order that an intelligent
</p>
<p>judgment shall be reached. At the time of this trial there were
</p>
<p>just two classes of people in this country the friends and the
</p>
<p>enemies of the government. The former were united and deter-
</p>
<p>mined in their purpose and effort to preserve and perpetuate
</p>
<p>the government established by our fathers under the constitution
</p>
<p>that included in its purpose and provisions the union of the states
</p>
<p>and made us a nation. The latter were madly bent on its over-
</p>
<p>throw, and so judged favorably or unfavorably of the occurrences
</p>
<p>of the times, as they tended to favor or hinder the accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment of their purposes. The feelings of both parties had been
</p>
<p>wrought up to the highest pitch of intensity because the mat-
</p>
<p>ters at issue had been submitted to the arbitrament of the sword.
</p>
<p>The result of this appeal was clearly foreshadowed at the time
</p>
<p>of the assassination of the President, and before the conclusion
</p>
<p>of the trial of his murderers the cause of the Confederacy had
</p>
<p>collapsed. The rebellion was virtually overcome. The deep
</p>
<p>political scheme to give it a new lease of life and bring to its
</p>
<p>aid new elements of success by the assassinations that had been
</p>
<p>planned, had been too long delayed, and its execution had
</p>
<p>become utterly impracticable. The soldiers of the rebellion had
</p>
<p>fought their fight a brave and plucky and protracted fight.
</p>
<p>They realized the hopelessness of their cause and, though greatly

</p>
<p>disappointed and mortified at their failure, they had the con-
</p>
<p>PREFACE. 9
</p>
<p>sciousness that they had done all that brave men could do to
</p>
<p>win success, and so were ready to accept the result, return to
</p>
<p>their homes, and resume citizenship under the government they
</p>
<p>were unable to overthrow. Not so with the secret active ene-
</p>
<p>mies of the government. They were not willing to accept defeat,
</p>
<p>but were, nevertheless (happily for the country), in a condition
</p>
<p>that they could only show their enmity by maligning and villify-
</p>
<p>ing the authorities they were unable to overthrow; and of this
</p>
<p>privilege they fully availed themselves. Thus it has come to pass
</p>
<p>that the magnitude, scope, and purpose of the assassination con-
</p>
<p>piracy are unknown to the present generation. All that a large
</p>
<p>majority of those who have come upon the stage of action since
</p>
<p>that time know of this, in many respects, one of the most import-
</p>
<p>ant trials that has ever occurred in our history, is what they have
</p>
<p>learned through the efforts of these vituperators ; and they have
</p>
<p>never seen it referred to other than as the trial of Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>The Commission was not called upon to render a decision as to
</p>
<p>the innocence or guilt of the persons charged by the govern-
</p>
<p>ment with being co-conspirators with John H. Surratt and John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, who were not in the custody of the government
</p>
<p>and so not before the Commission ; but the government, having
</p>
<p>assumed the responsibility of charging Jefferson Davis, George
</p>
<p>N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson, William C. Cleary,
</p>
<p>Clement C. Clay, George Harper, George Young, and others, with
</p>
<p>thus conspiring to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, Andrew
</p>
<p>Johnson, Wm. H. Seward, and Ulysses S. Grant, was under the
</p>
<p>necessity of vindicating its honor and dignity before the world
</p>
<p>by presenting the evidence in its possession on which its charge
</p>
<p>was founded. It will be my purpose to present this evidence,
</p>
<p>and to show the full significance and purpose of the plot, and
</p>
<p>with whom it originated. Many of the prominent actors in this

<p>tragedy have been summoned before a higher tribunal to
</p>
<p>10 PREFACE.
</p>
<p>answer for the deeds done in the body. There we are con-
</p>
<p>tent to leave them, assured that " all things are naked and
</p>
<p>open to the eyes of Him with whom they have to do," and
</p>
<p>that there will be no mistakes made in the decisions there ren-
</p>
<p>dered. And toward those who yet remain, it is with no feel-
</p>
<p>ings of personal enmity that the author shall write. He only
</p>
<p>knows them as they are revealed in the testimony, and by this
</p>
<p>he shall endeavor to deal fairly and candidly. They made
</p>
<p>themselves conspicuous in their connection with public affairs
</p>
<p>of the greatest importance, and so their acts belong to the
</p>
<p>public. If they have made a bad record, it is due to the truth
</p>
<p>of history that their acts shall be fully unfolded. History is a
</p>
<p>truthful narration of events that have occurred ; and its con-
</p>
<p>clusions must be based on a consideration of all of the facts,
</p>
<p>taken in their proper order and relation to the events. The
</p>
<p>aim of the writer has been to give a candid and reliable his-
</p>
<p>tory of the Great Conspiracy as deduced from the evidence
</p>
<p>before the Commission and to be found in the official report
</p>
<p>of the proceedings published by Ben Pittman immediately after
</p>
<p>the trial.
</p>
<p>The asperities of the great conflict have been largely oblit-
</p>
<p>erated by the many happy years of peace that have inter-
</p>
<p>vened since that unhappy period. We have but one country
</p>
<p>and one flag, which almost all have learned to love as of old.
</p>
<p>Let us draw wisdom and virtue from the history of the past,
</p>
<p>learning as well from our errors and mistakes as from our
</p>
<p>virtues, that we may, by a course of well-doing, gain the favor
</p>
<p>of Him who holds the destiny of nations in His hands, and
</p>
<p>who pulls down one and sets another up.
</p>
<p>The stability of a popular government must rest on the virtue
</p>
<p>and intelligence of its people. Our institutions were established

</p>
<p>on this basis alone, and on this alone can they stand. The
</p>
<p>PREFACE. I i
</p>
<p>divorcement of Church and State by the framers of our con-
</p>
<p>stitution was one of the wise conclusions which they drew from
</p>
<p>the past; but it was no part of their purpose to divorce relig-
</p>
<p>ion from the State. On the contrary, their politics was a part
</p>
<p>of their religion and was deduced from the teachings of God's
</p>
<p>word. Let us beware of the effort of the present time to
</p>
<p>divorce politics from religion because we rightly divorce the
</p>
<p>Church from the State.
</p>
<p>There is no morality that can make a man a valuable and
</p>
<p>a reliable citizen of a free state except the morality of the
</p>
<p>Christian religion as taught in God's word. It is the duty,
</p>
<p>therefore, of every parent and every teacher to instill into the
</p>
<p>minds of our youth this Christian morality as a basis for the
</p>
<p>highest patriotism and noblest citizenship. Let the American
</p>
<p>flag float over every school-house, and the morality of the
</p>
<p>Bible be taught with the authority inherent in God's word.
</p>
<p>Then will the days of assassinations, whether political or relig-
</p>
<p>ious, come to an end. Owing to a variety of causes, the
</p>
<p>facts connected with this most important event in our nation's
</p>
<p>history have been slurred over and obscured. Scarcely one in
</p>
<p>a thousand of our people to-day have any knowledge of their
</p>
<p>existence.
</p>
<p>The object of the writer will be to revive them and bring
</p>
<p>them out clearly to the knowledge of all.

<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY.
</p>
<p>THE rebellion of the slave-holding states, and the attempt to
</p>
<p>establish a separate government by force of arms, was solely in
</p>
<p>the interest of the institution of slavery. The Southern Confed-
</p>
<p>eracy was to rest on this institution as its corner-stone. By the
</p>
<p>establishment of the Confederacy it was intended to end, forever,
</p>
<p>the agitation of this question, and establish the system of human
</p>
<p>slavery as one of the permanent institutions of the world. And
</p>
<p>all this in the nineteenth century of the Christian era ! Prepara-
</p>
<p>tory to this the pulpit and the press had been suborned, the
</p>
<p>Christian conscience of the country had been debauched, and the
</p>
<p>doctrine that slavery was a Divine institution was taught, and
</p>
<p>accepted as true, by one-half of the American people.
</p>
<p>A doctor of divinity, or even a common preacher, who could
</p>
<p>prove this to his own satisfaction, and that of his hearers, at once
</p>
<p>achieved popularity, and had his great learning and ability heralded
</p>
<p>by the secular press throughout the South land. Neither was this
</p>
<p>kind of preaching confined to the South. It found a distinct and
</p>
<p>earnest echo in many places in the North. It was argued, and no
</p>
<p>doubt sincerely believed, that slavery was the best condition for
</p>
<p>securing the happiness and welfare of the African race the condi-
</p>
<p>tion in which the negro could be most useful to the world ; that
</p>
<p>his condition had been greatly improved by his transplantation from
</p>
<p>a heathen land and the environments of barbarism to a Christian
</p>
<p>land and civilized and Christian environments ; and that subjection
</p>
<p>to a higher and superior race was necessary to his deriving the high-
</p>
<p>est benefit from the change. Slavery, it was taught, was a patri-
</p>
<p>archal institution, and that it was only through it that the highest
</p>
<p>ideal of human civilization could be attained. It was natural that

<p>I 8 ASSASSINA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>a people whose judgment had crystalized around such opinions as
</p>
<p>these should be intolerant of opposition, as they had closed the
</p>
<p>door to discussion on this question ; and so for several generations a
</p>
<p>contrary opinion was not tolerated, or allowed to find expression, in
</p>
<p>the slave-holding states. The agitation of this question, in its
</p>
<p>moral aspects, by constantly increasing numbers of earnest, able
</p>
<p>men in the North, at last led to the organization of a political
</p>
<p>party opposed to this institution, and the question of slavery thus
</p>
<p>became a political question.
</p>
<p>The friends of the institution instinctively recognized the danger
</p>
<p>that thus confronted them, and began to strengthen their fences by
</p>
<p>most stringent measures to repress discussion and shut out the
</p>
<p>light. This was a tacit admission that they felt themselves unable
</p>
<p>to stand before the world in argument. It may be laid down as
</p>
<p>an axiom, that whenever a political party forecloses discussion on
</p>
<p>any subject, but more especially on a great moral issue, it is not
</p>
<p>only on the wrong side of that issue, but has an intuitive percep-
</p>
<p>tion of that fact.
</p>
<p>It may also be accepted as an axiom, that the more inconsistent
</p>
<p>a man's attitude is on any great moral question the more intolerant
</p>
<p>will he be of opposition. Not only were the most stringent laws
</p>
<p>passed to prevent the discussion of the institution of slavery in its
</p>
<p>moral aspects in the Southern States, but also the most lawless
</p>
<p>and violent measures were resorted to, so that it was as much as
</p>
<p>a man's life was worth to undertake to make a public argument
</p>
<p>against slavery in a slave-holding state, and even to be found earn-
</p>
<p>estly opposed to the institution in sentiment was to put personal
</p>
<p>safety in jeopardy. The making of this question a political ques-
</p>
<p>tion tended largely to de-sectionalize it. No party could hope
</p>
<p>to succeed, as a National party, without the vote of the South, and
</p>
<p>this could only be secured by concessions to the demands of the
</p>
<p>slave holders in the interest of that institution ; and so the party
</p>
<p>that was willing to concede the most to their demands became the

</p>
<p>dominant party in the nation. Thus the leading Democratic poli-
</p>
<p>ticians, all over the North, became the staunch advocates of
</p>
<p>slavery ; and we all know with what blind confidence, and fierce
</p>
<p>determination, the masses follow their political leaders. The cul-
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY. 19
</p>
<p>mination of the contest over this question, resulting in the election
</p>
<p>of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency by a party openly opposed
</p>
<p>to slavery, caused its friends to take their appeal from the ballot
</p>
<p>box to the sword ; and this appeal found those who were the
</p>
<p>friends of the institution from political party considerations scattered
</p>
<p>all over the North in quite formidable numbers, constituting an
</p>
<p>enemy in the rear of our armies that gave to the administration of
</p>
<p>President Lincoln no little anxiety and embarrassment, making it
</p>
<p>necessary for him, as early as September, 1862, to proclaim martial
</p>
<p>law and suspend the writ of habeas corpus in respect to all persons
</p>
<p>in the United States who were found to be actively disloyal, and
</p>
<p>engaged in efforts to aid the rebellion. The following is a copy of
</p>
<p>his proclamation :
</p>
<p>GENERAL ORDERS NO. 141.
</p>
<p>WAR DEPARTMENT,
</p>
<p>ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 25, 1862.
</p>
<p>The following Proclamation by the President is published for the information and
</p>
<p>government of the Army and all concerned :
</p>
<p>By the President of the United States of America.
</p>
<p>A PROCLAMATION.
</p>
<p>Whereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers but also
</p>
<p>portions of the militia of the States by draft, in order to suppress the insurrection exist-
</p>
<p>ing in the United States, and disloyal persons are not adequately restrained by the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary processes of law from hindering this measure and from giving aid and comfort in
</p>
<p>various ways to the insurrection : Now, therefore, be it ordered : First, That during
</p>
<p>the existing insurrection, and as a necessary measure for suppressing the same, all rebels
</p>
<p>and insurgents, their aiders and abettors, within the United States, and all persons dis-
</p>
<p>couraging volunteer enlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal prac-
</p>
<p>tice affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the United States shall
</p>
<p>be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and punishment by court-martial or military
</p>
<p>commission. Second, That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all per-
</p>
<p>sons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall be, imprisoned in

<p>any fort, camp, arsenal, military prison, or other place of confinement, by any military

<p>authority, or by sentence of any court-martial or military commission. In witness whereof
</p>
<p>I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

<p>United States the eighty-seventh.

</p>
<p>"Official."
</p>
<p>20 ASSASSINA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>This disloyal element was rendered much more formidable by
</p>
<p>the fact of its perfect combination, through secret, oath-bound
</p>
<p>organizations under the names of Knights of the Golden Circle and
</p>
<p>Order of American Knights. These secret orders no doubt had
</p>
<p>their origin in the South, preparatory to secession and war ; but
</p>
<p>after the war had been commenced it was chiefly in the North
</p>
<p>that they were useful to the rebel cause, and it was through these
</p>
<p>that the assassination of the President-elect was to have been
</p>
<p>accomplished at Baltimore when on his way to the Capital in 1861,
</p>
<p>and thus his inauguration 'as President was to have been prevented.
</p>
<p>We thus see the desperate character of the political leaders of the
</p>
<p>rebellion, who were ready to frustrate the expressed will of the
</p>
<p>people by resorting to assassination. We need not think strange
</p>
<p>that a rebellion which was ready to resort to such means in its
</p>
<p>incipiency should finally expire under the weight of this infamy.
</p>
<p>By these secret organizations, the enemies of the government,
</p>
<p>wherever they might be, possessed the means of a secret recog-
</p>
<p>nition amongst their members. And under whatever circumstances
</p>
<p>they might be placed, the obligations of their oath afforded them
</p>
<p>confidence and security. They constituted a brotherhood, and by
</p>
<p>their secret grips, signs, passwords, etc., they had a guarantee of
</p>
<p>unity of sentiment and of purpose, and of faithfulness to each other
</p>
<p>and to the obligations of their oath.
</p>
<p>These organizations were regarded as allies by the rebel govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and were counted on as a valuable factor to secure the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of its arms. This element in the North kept itself in constant
</p>
<p>communication with the rebel government and the rebel armies,
</p>
<p>and thus, in a large degree, filled the place of spies in giving inform-
</p>
<p>ation. To furnish facilities for communication with its friends in
</p>
<p>the North, as also for various other purposes in aid of the rebel
</p>
<p>cause, the Confederate Government sent a number of its ablest
</p>
<p>civilians to Canada, at an early period of the war, as its secret
</p>
<p>agents, who established their headquarters at Montreal. This cabal

<p>consisted of the following persons : Jacob Thompson, who had been
</p>
<p>Secretary of the Interior under Buchanan's administration ; Clem-
</p>
<p>ent C. Clay, who had been a United States Senator from Alabama ;
</p>
<p>Beverly Tucker, who had been a Circuit Judge in Virginia; George
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY. 21
</p>
<p>N. Sanders, William C. Cleary, Prof. Holcomb, George Harper,
</p>
<p>and others. Of these, Thompson, Tucker, and Clay seem to have
</p>
<p>held semi-official positions, and we will designate them as Davis's
</p>
<p>Canada Cabinet. The others named, as also others unnamed above,
</p>
<p>appear to have acted as aids, in a subordinate capacity, in the exe-
</p>
<p>cution of their plots. They all claimed to be acting as agents of
</p>
<p>the Rebel Government upon their oaths on the trial for the extra-
</p>
<p>dition of the St. Alban's raiders.
</p>
<p>The proclamation of martial law and suspension of the writ of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus in September, 1862, had the effect of restraining the
</p>
<p>open, active efforts of these secret disloyal organizations to cripple
</p>
<p>the resources at Mr. Lincoln's command for suppressing the rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, inasmuch as any such efforts were met by arrest, military trial,
</p>
<p>and imprisonment ; yet, inasmuch as they created a necessity for a
</p>
<p>military police at all important points in the North, they felt that
</p>
<p>they were still rendering valuable service to the rebellion by thus
</p>
<p>weakening the force at the front ; and whilst it was necessary to
</p>
<p>conduct their operations with much more secrecy, their organiza-
</p>
<p>tions were not disbanded. They went on to effect a complete mili-
</p>
<p>tary organization, thoroughly officered and drilled, and in many
</p>
<p>cases armed, holding themselves ready to take the field in any emer-
</p>
<p>gency that might arise that would justify so bold a measure. The
</p>
<p>Canada Cabinet watched over these organizations with great inter-
</p>
<p>est, and directed their operations, and by many schemes sought to
</p>
<p>bring about an emergency that would enable them to bring this army,
</p>
<p>which they had hidden away in secrecy, into the field of active oper-
</p>
<p>ations for the success of their cause. The officers of these secret
</p>
<p>military organizations were chosen from the local political leaders in
</p>
<p>the different localities where they existed, and kept themselves in
</p>
<p>communication with the Canada Cabinet, and through this medium
</p>
<p>the Confederate Government was kept informed of their strength,
</p>
<p>organization, plans, and purposes. So bold and active did they
</p>
<p>become, in spite of the efforts of the military police for their sup-

</p>
<p>pression, that the government finally found it necessary, through
</p>
<p>its secret service department, to possess itself of a thorough knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of these organizations, and in this way was enabled to cap-
</p>
<p>ture the arms and munitions of war which had been secured and
</p>
<p>22 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>were hidden away in secrecy by them, and also to arrest the lead-
</p>
<p>ing officers of these organizations in several states. Whilst by
</p>
<p>these means these treasonable combinations were seriously crip-
</p>
<p>pled, they were unchanged in animus and still struggled to main-
</p>
<p>tain their existence. They kept themselves in communication with
</p>
<p>the Canada conspirators, and ready to co-operate with them for
</p>
<p>the success of their schemes should the conditions become suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently promising to justify them in declaring themselves openly.
</p>
<p>It was in the summer of 1864 that Jacob Thompson, according
</p>
<p>to the testimony before the Commission, declared that he had his
</p>
<p>friends all over the Northern States, who were willing to go to any
</p>
<p>length in order to serve the cause of the South. Jefferson Davis's
</p>
<p>Canada Cabinet kept up a constant correspondence with their
</p>
<p>chief, through secret agents who travelled directly through the
</p>
<p>states, and even through the city of Washington.
</p>
<p>So potent was the aid of secret signs, grips, pass-words, etc., as
</p>
<p>a means of recognition, and so universally were the members of
</p>
<p>these secret orders diffused over the country, that they could go
</p>
<p>anywhere. Should one agent find it necessary to stop his task
</p>
<p>for fear of detection, another would take it up ; and where men
</p>
<p>could not go, women went, to carry communications. The Canada
</p>
<p>Cabinet was well supplied with money by the government at
</p>
<p>Richmond, and in this department of the service Jacob Thomp-
</p>
<p>son seems to have been Secretary of the Treasury. He kept his
</p>
<p>deposits largely in the Ontario Bank of Montreal, and his credits
</p>
<p>there arose from Southern bills of exchange on London. The
</p>
<p>object of the writer in this introductory chapter has been to place
</p>
<p>clearly before his readers the formidable character of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, which, with the President of the Confederacy at its head, and
</p>
<p>organized by his Canada Cabinet, was intended to throw the loyal
</p>
<p>North into a state of chaotic confusion and bring to the aid of
</p>
<p>their sinking cause the disloyal element all over the North, by a
</p>
<p>series of assassinations which would leave the nation without a civil

<p>and military head and without any constitutional way of electing
</p>
<p>another President, and at the same time would deprive the armies
</p>
<p>of the United States of a lawful commander. This was the last
</p>
<p>card of the political leaders of the rebellion, the last desperate

</p>
<p>resort to retrieve a cause that had been manifestly lost in open war-
</p>
<p>fare. It may seem like temerity in the writer to make such a
</p>
<p>charge involving a total disregard of the laws of civilized warfare,
</p>
<p>and such utter moral depravity on the part of these conspirators,
</p>
<p>and to claim for their wicked project the approval of Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, but the evidence in the possession of the government and
</p>
<p>adduced before the Commission, it will be seen, fully justified the
</p>
<p>government in making this charge. The persons brought before
</p>
<p>the Commission, though in full sympathy in sentiment with their
</p>
<p>employers, were merely the tools and hired assassins of the 'Canada
</p>
<p>Cabinet, acting under the advice and sanction of their chief. I
</p>
<p>shall now proceed to bring before my readers the denouement of
</p>
<p>their plot, and, from the evidence given before the Commission,
</p>
<p>show that the origin, scope and purpose of the conspiracy have

</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PLOT.
</p>
<p>THE evidence which will be hereafter referred to shows that
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt had, as early as the
</p>
<p>latter part of October, or early in November, 1864, entered into a
</p>
<p>contract with Davis's Canada Cabinet to accomplish the assassi-
</p>
<p>nations they had planned, and that they immediately entered upon
</p>
<p>their work of preparation. It would seem from the evidence, that
</p>
<p>at that time the purpose was to execute their designs at a much
</p>
<p>earlier date than they did ; and that this delay was occasioned by
</p>
<p>the Canada conspirators.
</p>
<p>Surratt and Booth, however, were busied from that time on in
</p>
<p>making their preparations. The first step was to enlist in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy a sufficient number of competent and reliable assistants, to
</p>
<p>each one of whom was assigned the part he was to take in it, and
</p>
<p>to train, equip, and prepare him for the part assigned him. The
</p>
<p>assassination of President Lincoln had fallen to Payne by lot ; and
</p>
<p>to him was entrusted the task of making all needed preparations.
</p>
<p>Payne had visited Canada during the fall of 1 864, and probably
</p>
<p>there made the acquaintance of Booth. To a man of Booth's sagac-
</p>
<p>ity, a mere glance at Payne would be sufficient to impress him
</p>
<p>with the idea that he was one of the helpers he wanted ; and as we
</p>
<p>find him as early as February, 1865, transplanted to Washington
</p>
<p>City by Booth and Surratt, and from that time on associating with
</p>
<p>them very intimately but very secretly, and without employment,
</p>
<p>or visible means, passing back and forth between Washington and
</p>
<p>Baltimore, and finally provided with quarters in Washington by
</p>
<p>Surratt, there can be no doubt that he was early enlisted in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and supported by the Canada Cabinet through their
</p>
<p>agents in Washington Booth and Surratt. The author is led to

</p>
<p>conclude from studying the evidence that Booth and Surratt were
</p>
<p>acting under a considerable latitude of provisional instructions,
</p>
<p>and that to them was entrusted the selection of the time and place
</p>
<p>for the accomplishment of their purpose. There were a number
</p>
<p>of persons in Canada, members of the conspiracy, who were ex-
</p>
<p>pected to take an active part in its execution ; and it is altogether
</p>
<p>probable that the original plan contemplated the accomplishment
</p>
<p>of these assassinations as opportunities could be found or made,
</p>
<p>and that for each one a man had been assigned.
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth and John Harrison Surratt were the leaders
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy in Washington, they having proposed to their
</p>
<p>co-conspirators in Canada to accomplish for them the assassina-
</p>
<p>tions they had planned.
</p>
<p>They were stimulated by their intense hostility to the admin-
</p>
<p>istration of President Lincoln and desire for the establishment of
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy, and also by the delusive idea of winning
</p>
<p>enduring fame and the lasting gratitude of their countrymen of the
</p>
<p>South for being thus the instruments of retrieving the fortunes of
</p>
<p>their dying cause. But in addition to these considerations, they
</p>
<p>had large promises of pecuniary reward. They were, in fact, the
</p>
<p>hired assassins of Jefferson Davis and his Canada Cabinet.
</p>
<p>These two men had been engaged for months in making their
</p>
<p>preparations for the assassination of the President, Vice-President,
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward, and General Grant. They visited and con-
</p>
<p>ferred with the Canada conspirators from time to time during the
</p>
<p>summer and fall of 1864, and early winter of 1865. They traversed
</p>
<p>the counties of Prince George, Charles, and St. Mary's, Maryland,
</p>
<p>lying along the north side of the Potomac below Washington, to
</p>
<p>prepare the way for escape by securing confederates along the
</p>
<p>contemplated route who would assist in facilitating their flight by
</p>
<p>aiding them in their progress, or by concealing them if necessary.
</p>
<p>Booth had spent some time in this work during the fall and early
</p>
<p>winter, making himself familiar with the geography of the coun-

</p>
<p>try, roads, etc., under the pretence that he desired to purchase
</p>
<p>lands in Maryland. He found in Charles County Dr. S. A.
</p>
<p>Mudd, who sympathized with his plans, and entered into them
</p>
<p>at least so far as to pledge him any assistance he could give him
</p>
<p>26 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>in making his escape. Mudd also visited Booth two or three
</p>
<p>times in Washington during the winter, introducing him on the
</p>
<p>occasion of his first visit to John H. Surratt; and in the course of
</p>
<p>these visits he was always found in company with Booth and
</p>
<p>others of the conspirators who were to take an active part in its
</p>
<p>accomplishment, and was no doubt kept well informed of the
</p>
<p>progress of their preparations, and of the time when it would be
</p>
<p>attempted after that had been determined upon. Surratt also
</p>
<p>spent much time during the winter in this part of Maryland,
</p>
<p>in preparation for the work. Being at home there, he could
</p>
<p>render Booth valuable assistance by procuring friends who would
</p>
<p>aid him in his flight, and in getting him across the Potomac at
</p>
<p>the selected point. As this was on the line of a regular under-
</p>
<p>ground mail route between Washington and Richmond, with which
</p>
<p>Surratt was familiar, he, of course, had no difficulty in making
</p>
<p>satisfactory arrangerrients, the great mass of the population in all
</p>
<p>of these counties being intensely disloyal.
</p>
<p>They had selected and arranged with Payne, Atzerodt, O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>lin, Arnold, Herold, Spangler, and numerous other parties who
</p>
<p>were never made known, to take an active part in the work of
</p>
<p>assassination, or to aid them in their escape. Booth and Surratt
</p>
<p>had provided horses for the occasion, and, with Atzerodt and
</p>
<p>Herold, were known to a number of liverymen of whom they were
</p>
<p>liberal and frequent patrons.
</p>
<p>Surratt provided quarters for Payne at the Herndon House,
</p>
<p>representing him to be a delicate gentleman, and stipulating that
</p>
<p>his meals should be served to him in his room. Atzerodt, who
</p>
<p>was to have assassinated the Vice-President, had taken a room at
</p>
<p>the Pennsylvania House. Booth, being an actor, and familiar with
</p>
<p>the routine of the play and the work of the assistants on the stage,
</p>
<p>having selected Ford's Theatre as the place for the accomplishment
</p>
<p>of his purpose, proceeded to make himself at home amongst the
</p>
<p>habitues of that establishment. He was a very handsome man,

</p>
<p>stylish in his dress, dissolute in his habits, a constant and free
</p>
<p>drinker, generous in the expenditure of his money on his vices of
</p>
<p>smoking and drinking, and of great personal magnetism. He soon
</p>
<p>ingratiated himself with the employees of the theatre, and became a
</p>
<p>general favorite.
</p>
<p>PREPARATIONS FOR EXECUTION OF THE PLOT. 27
</p>
<p>It was necessary that he should have a co-conspirator at the
</p>
<p>theatre to assist him in making his escape. He had labored hard
</p>
<p>with an actor in New York by the name of Chester, with whom he
</p>
<p>was acquainted, to engage him in the conspiracy, that he might
</p>
<p>station him at the door of his exit, to see that his way should be
</p>
<p>clear and the door open at the critical moment, for which service
</p>
<p>he offered to pay him three thousand dollars ; but Chester, after
</p>
<p>several interviews and much importunity, absolutely declined, and
</p>
<p>begged Booth never to mention the matter to him again. Failing
</p>
<p>to secure Chester, he turned his attention to Edward Spangler, an
</p>
<p>employee at the theatre. Spangler was a man of dissipated habits,
</p>
<p>low moral tone, and little intellectual culture, and being politically
</p>
<p>in sympathy with Booth, he was easily led by him into the conspir-
</p>
<p>acy. Booth had had a shed fitted up as a stable in an alley back
</p>
<p>of the theatre, and had kept his horse in it occasionally for some
</p>
<p>time previous, that he might have it convenient when the supreme
</p>
<p>moment should have arrived, without exciting suspicion. To
</p>
<p>reach the private box fitted up on the occasion for the occupancy
</p>
<p>of the President and General Grant, with their wives, it was neces-
</p>
<p>sary \Q pass through two doors. The first led into a passage behind
</p>
<p>the box, the second from this passage into the box. To prevent
</p>
<p>any one from following him into the passage and hindering the
</p>
<p>accomplishment of his purpose, Booth had cut, himself, or more
</p>
<p>likely had had Spangler, who was a kind of rough carpenter, cut
</p>
<p>a mortise in the plastering of the passage wall, in such a position
</p>
<p>with reference to the door that the end of a wooden bar, three and
</p>
<p>a half feet long, which had been prepared for that purpose, could
</p>
<p>be inserted in the mortise, and the other end placed against the
</p>
<p>panel of the door so that it could not be opened from the outside.
</p>
<p>That ingress to this passage might not be prevented by the
</p>
<p>bolting of the door by the President and his party after entering,
</p>
<p>the screws of the fastenings had been drawn, so that it could be
</p>
<p>easily pushed open. A hole had been bored through the door to

</p>
<p>the box, opposite where the President's chair was placed, with a
</p>
<p>small bit, and reamed out with a knife, so that Booth could, after
</p>
<p>gaining the passage and barring the door behind him, peep through
</p>
<p>this hole and assure himself of the exact position of his intended
</p>
<p>28 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>victim. The manner in which all of these arrangements had been
</p>
<p>made, the mortise in the plastered wall, the bar of wood fitted to
</p>
<p>the mortise, and in length having been exactly prepared to fit
</p>
<p>against the panel of the door and act as a brace, show that all
</p>
<p>these preparations had been made with the greatest forethought
</p>
<p>and care.
</p>
<p>About three weeks previous to the assassination, John H. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt, Herold, and Atzerodt brought to the tavern at Surrattsville,
</p>
<p>in Maryland, about ten miles below Washington City, owned by
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt, and at the time occupied by a man by the name of
</p>
<p>Lloyd, two carbines, with ammunition, a monkey-wrench, and a
</p>
<p>piece of rope. Surratt asked Lloyd to take charge of these things
</p>
<p>and keep them secreted, saying they would be called for before a
</p>
<p>great while, at the same time showing him a suitable place about
</p>
<p>the house in which to hide them. The Surratt family had lived
</p>
<p>in this house and kept a country tavern until within a few months
</p>
<p>previous, when they had removed to Washington, renting their
</p>
<p>tavern to Lloyd, so that Surratt was much more familiar with the
</p>
<p>house than Lloyd. These things, as we shall see, were placed
</p>
<p>there for the use of Booth and his companion in their flight 'after
</p>
<p>the assassination. As a precautionary measure, Booth, on the
</p>
<p>Tuesday before the assassination, sought an interview with Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, who shortly after that interview discovered that she had
</p>
<p>some private business at Surrattsville that had to be attended to
</p>
<p>that day, and so she asked Mr. Wiechmann, a young man who had
</p>
<p>been a boarder at her house for several months, to drive her down,
</p>
<p>saying that she wanted to go and see a Mr. Nothey who owed
</p>
<p>her some money. She then sent Wiechmann to Booth, to get his
</p>
<p>horse and buggy for the drive. Booth told Wiechmann that he
</p>
<p>had sold his horse and buggy, but gave him ten dollars with which
</p>
<p>to procure one. Meeting Lloyd on the way down, driving up to
</p>
<p>Washington, they stopped ; Lloyd got out of his buggy and went
</p>
<p>to the side of Mrs. Surratt's buggy, on which she was sitting, when

</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt told Lloyd, as he afterwards testified, in a low voice,
</p>
<p>so that Wiechmann did not hear what she said, to have those
</p>
<p>shooting irons ready, or handy, as they would be called for be-
</p>
<p>fore long. On the day of the assassination Booth again had a
</p>
<p>PREPARATIONS FOR EXECUTION OF THE PLOT. 29
</p>
<p>private interview with Mrs. Surratt, after which she again asked
</p>
<p>Wiechmann to drive her down to Surrattsville, claiming the same
</p>
<p>errand as before. On this occasion she sought an opportunity for
</p>
<p>a private interview with Lloyd, when she told him to have the
</p>
<p>carbines handy, as they would be called for that night, at the
</p>
<p>same time handing him a field-glass, which Booth had given to
</p>
<p>her, and telling him to have two bottles of whiskey ready.
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt left Washington for Richmond on the 25th of
</p>
<p>March and returned to Washington on the 3d of April, leaving for
</p>
<p>Montreal on the evening of the same day. He showed to Wiechmann
</p>
<p>an old college friend and, at this time, a boarder in his mother's
</p>
<p>house nine or eleven twenty-dollar gold pieces, and sixty dollars
</p>
<p>in greenbacks, on his return from Richmond. Surratt, in his Rock-
</p>
<p>ville lecture, admits that he received two hundred dollars in gold
</p>
<p>from Benjamin to pay expenses and remunerate for services.
</p>
<p>Surratt left Washington for Canada on the evening of the 3d
</p>
<p>of April, and we find him, by the evidence, in Montreal on the
</p>
<p>6th, where he delivered to Thompson a cipher dispatch from
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, and a letter from Mr. Benjamin, of Davis's
</p>
<p>Richmond Cabinet. After reading these documents, Thompson,
</p>
<p>laying his hand on them, said, " This makes the thing all right."
</p>
<p>The sanction of the rebel president to his arrangements with the
</p>
<p>assassins had been obtained, and authority also for the expendi-
</p>
<p>ture of funds to fulfil the contract. The Canada conspirators who
</p>
<p>were to take a part prepared at once, and started for the States,
</p>
<p>boasting to their friends that they would hear of the death of Old
</p>
<p>Abe and others before ten days. This was on the 8th of April,
</p>
<p>and nothing now remained but to find, and use, an opportunity ;
</p>
<p>and Booth selected the appearance of the President at the theatre
</p>
<p>as affording the opportunity he sought, and proceeded to make
</p>
<p>all his arrangements accordingly.
</p>
<p>All things were now ready. Booth had selected the route for
</p>
<p>his escape and had provided to be furnished with a field-glass, two

</p>
<p>carbines, and two bottles of whiskey at Surrattsville, having sent
</p>
<p>a notice to Lloyd to have them ready, as they would be called for
</p>
<p>that night. He had provided horses from a livery-stable for him-
</p>
<p>self and Herold, who was to accompany him. He had also pro-
</p>
<p>30 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>vided a horse for Payne, whose part was to murder Secretary
</p>
<p>Seward. He had assembled his assistants in Washington, to one of
</p>
<p>whom, Michael O'Laughlin, he had assigned the task of the assas-
</p>
<p>sination of General Grant; and having made these preparations,
</p>
<p>he spent the day and afternoon of the I4th of April looking after the
</p>
<p>matter generally, and keeping up his courage, or rather reckless-
</p>
<p>ness, with frequent potations of whiskey. To Payne he had given
</p>
<p>a one-eyed bay horse, which he had purchased of a man by the
</p>
<p>name of Gardner, a neighbor of Dr. Samuel Mudd, in Charles
</p>
<p>County, Maryland. Mudd accompanied him, and introduced him
</p>
<p>to Gardner as a man who was desirous of purchasing land in that
</p>
<p>part of Maryland, and who wished a good driving horse that he
</p>
<p>could use for a short time. During the afternoon of the I4th,
</p>
<p>Booth, Herold, and Atzerodt hired horses from liverymen, and
</p>
<p>were to be seen riding here and there about the streets of Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, frequently stopping at saloons to refresh themselves with
</p>
<p>that which obtunds all moral sensibility and makes men reckless
</p>
<p>in wickedness. Booth was acting the part of a general mustering
</p>
<p>his forces for the conflict, part of which he thus displayed openly,
</p>
<p>but keeping another part in concealment. He kept himself in
</p>
<p>active communication with all, and delivered his orders and
</p>
<p>instructions. Feeling the full force of the responsibility of his
</p>
<p>engagment, and earnestly intent on its complete and thorough
</p>
<p>accomplishment, he attended in person to every detail to make
</p>
<p>failure, if possible, an impossibility.
</p>
<p>It would seem that a previous attempt had been made to assassi-
</p>
<p>nate the President, which had resulted in a failure. It was known
</p>
<p>that President Lincoln was in the habit of riding out to the Soldiers'
</p>
<p>Home of evenings, passing through a lonely suburb of the city un-
</p>
<p>guarded. Some time in March, John Wilkes Booth, John H. Surratt,
</p>
<p>Payne, Atzerodt, Herold, and two others, left the house of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt about two o'clock in the afternoon, on horseback, armed
</p>
<p>with revolvers and bowie-knives, and returned about six o'clock

</p>
<p>under the greatest possible excitement of rage and disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment. All the evidence went to show that this expedition was
</p>
<p>regarded by them as one of the greatest importance, involving the
</p>
<p>necessity of leaving the city, perhaps for good, as their return in
</p>
<p>PREPARATIONS FOR EXECUTION OF THE PLOT. 31
</p>
<p>the evening was as much of a surprise to their friends as it was
</p>
<p>an occasion of dissatisfaction to themselves. I think there can
</p>
<p>hardly be a doubt that they expected to intercept the President
</p>
<p>on his way to the Home, and were lying in wait for him with the
</p>
<p>purpose of there assassinating him, and then making their escape.
</p>
<p>The President, however, upon the earnest advice of his cabinet,
</p>
<p>had yielded the point of riding unprotected and alone, and had
</p>
<p>accepted the protection of an escort of cavalry on these rides.
</p>
<p>Booth and his party finding him thus guarded had been compelled
</p>
<p>to abandon the idea of thus finding an opportunity to assassinate
</p>
<p>him, and so had to prepare a new plan of operations. There was
</p>
<p>a rumor, which found its way into the papers about this time, that
</p>
<p>there was a plot to capture the President and carry him a prisoner
</p>
<p>to Richmond ; but however much Booth's pride and vanity might
</p>
<p>have impelled him to achieve the notoriety that would have at-
</p>
<p>tended the accomplishment of such a feat, the difficulties and
</p>
<p>dangers attending its accomplishment must have been too obvious
</p>
<p>to a man of Booth's sagacity, and its success involved in too much
</p>
<p>uncertainty, to have justified him in making such an attempt.
</p>
<p>In view of all the facts, I conclude that the real purpose of
</p>
<p>Booth and his party on the occasion referred to was to murder
</p>
<p>the President, and trust to flight for concealment and safety. But
</p>
<p>now Booth was fully possessed with the idea of the practicabil-
</p>
<p>ity of his present plan, and was determined to know no such
</p>
<p>word as fail ; and that it was entirely possible that, but for a Pro-
</p>
<p>vidential interference, he might have made good his escape after
</p>
<p>murdering the President, we shall hereafter see.
</p>
<p>President Lincoln had been convinced by the most undoubted
</p>
<p>proofs that a plan for his assassination at Baltimore whilst on his
</p>
<p>way to Washington, in 1861, to assume the responsibilities of the
</p>
<p>office to which he had been called by the choice of the people,
</p>
<p>had been arranged and prepared for by his enemies, and had only
</p>
<p>been prevented of its execution by the strategic movement planned

</p>
<p>by his friends, by which he passed through that city during the
</p>
<p>night previous to the morning on which he was expected.
</p>
<p>" From the very beginning of his Presidency Mr. Lincoln had
</p>
<p>been constantly subject to the threats of his enemies and the
</p>
<p>32 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>warnings of his friends. The threats came in every form : his
</p>
<p>mail was infested with brutal and vulgar menace, mostly anony-
</p>
<p>mous, the proper expression of vile and cowardly minds.
</p>
<p>" The warnings were not less numerous ; the vaporings of vil-
</p>
<p>lage bullies, the extravagancies of excited secessionist politicians,
</p>
<p>even the drolling of practical jokers, were faithfully reported to
</p>
<p>him by zealous or nervous friends. Most of these communica-
</p>
<p>tions received no notice. In cases where there seemed a ground
</p>
<p>for inquiry it was made, as carefully as possible, by the President's
</p>
<p>private secretary and by the War Department, but always without
</p>
<p>substantial results.
</p>
<p>" Warnings that appeared to be most definite, when they came
</p>
<p>to be examined proved too vague and confused for further atten-
</p>
<p>tion. The President was too intelligent not to know he was in
</p>
<p>some danger. Madmen frequently made their way to the very
</p>
<p>door of the executive offices, and sometimes into Mr. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>presence.
</p>
<p>" He had himself so sane a mind, and a heart so kindly even to
</p>
<p>his enemies, that it was hard for him to believe in a political hatred
</p>
<p>so deadly as to lead to murder. He would sometimes laughingly
</p>
<p>say, ' Our friends on the other side would make nothing by ex-
</p>
<p>changing me for Hamlin,' the Vice-President having the reputation
</p>
<p>of more radical views than his chief. He knew, indeed, that incite-
</p>
<p>ments to murder him were not uncommon in the South. An adver-
</p>
<p>tisement had appeared in a paper of Selma, Alabama, in December,
</p>
<p>1864, opening a subscription for funds to affect the assassination
</p>
<p>of Lincoln, Seward, and Johnson before the inauguration."
</p>

<p>box, in which condition he could scarcely perform the duties of a
</p>
<p>President. By the hand of a murderer he could only die once ;
</p>
<p>to go continually in fear would be to die over and over."

</p>
<p>We have come to the point now where we find, on the part of
</p>
<p>his murderers, all things ready for his taking off ; and their intended

<p>victim prepared in mind for his fate, and ready to " die at the post
</p>
<p>of honor and duty." What a fearful, and at the same time, sublime

<p>kind, and bringing the world back to its allegiance to God, its
</p>

<p>Lincoln in the ultimate triumph of the right ! How sincerely and

<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT AND ATTEMPTED ASSASSINA-
</p>
<p>TION OF SECRETARY SEWARD.
</p>
<p>ON the morning of the I4th of April, 1865, the President's
</p>
<p>messenger went to Ford's Theatre in Washington City and en-
</p>
<p>gaged a private box for the President and General Grant, with
</p>
<p>their wives, to witness the play of " Our American Cousin," which
</p>
<p>was to be rendered there that night. The heavy burden of re-
</p>
<p>sponsibility, the weight of cares and anxieties which had for four
</p>
<p>long years rested on the head of President Lincoln in his official
</p>
<p>position of President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief
</p>
<p>of its army and navy, employed during all that time in suppressing
</p>
<p>a gigantic rebellion of the slave-holding States of the South against
</p>
<p>the constitutional and lawful authority of the government, and
</p>
<p>which had followed him into his second term of office, upon
</p>
<p>which he had just entered, had been partially lifted by the sig-
</p>
<p>nal success of the Union arms at Appomattox, and the surrender
</p>
<p>of Lee's army. General Grant, who had just accepted the uncon-
</p>
<p>ditional surrender of that army, and finished the work of dismiss-
</p>
<p>ing to their homes the officers and men who had composed it
</p>
<p>(and who for four long years had fought with such magnificent
</p>
<p>bravery, and manifested such earnestness and determinedness of
</p>
<p>purpose in a cause which, though bad, was no doubt esteemed by
</p>
<p>them to be just), under no other condition than that they should
</p>
<p>return to their homes and the pursuits of peaceful life, and desist
</p>
<p>from all further acts of hostility against the government they had
</p>
<p>sought, but failed, to overthrow, had gone to Washington to
</p>
<p>talk over the situation with the President and Secretary of War,
</p>
<p>and to decide on future operations for the speedy establishment
</p>
<p>of peace. With the surrender of Lee's army, and the successful

<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. 35
</p>
<p>march of Sherman from Atlanta to the sea, and his almost un-
</p>
<p>resisted progress up the coast toward the Nation's Capital, it was
</p>
<p>obvious that the rebellion had collapsed, and that the return of
</p>
<p>peace was just at hand. All loyal hearts throughout the land
</p>
<p>throbbed with joy, and praise and thanksgiving ascended to Him
</p>
<p>who had stamped the righteousness of the union cause with the
</p>
<p>signet of His approbation, in thus giving us the victory after a long
</p>
<p>and bloody contest. The years of sacrifice, toil, suffering and
</p>
<p>danger were almost forgotten in the gladness of that hour ; and
</p>
<p>the war-scarred veterans in the field, and their friends at home,
</p>
<p>were rejoicing at the prospect of a speedy re-union, under skies of
</p>
<p>peace. It was an hour big with the memories of the past and
</p>
<p>hopes of the future. When we think of what President Lincoln
</p>
<p>had endured through all these years of the war ; of his unfalter-
</p>
<p>ing purpose to discharge all the duties of his official oath, by pro-
</p>
<p>tecting, defending and preserving the constitution of his country ;
</p>
<p>of the formidable difficulties that had to be met and overcome
</p>
<p>difficulties thrown across his pathway often by friends, always by
</p>
<p>foes ; when we remember his largeness of soul, his unbounded
</p>
<p>love of, and sympathy with, mankind ; his all controlling love of
</p>
<p>his country and her institutions of freedom ; his patient tolera-
</p>
<p>tion of opposing views of martial and of political policy ; his self-
</p>
<p>poise, and almost infallible appreciation of the situation and its
</p>
<p>demands, in whatever circumstances he might be placed ; his kind-
</p>
<p>ness of nature and goodness of heart, we can well conceive what
</p>
<p>must have been his fullness of joy on this the last day of his
</p>
<p>sojourn on earth. God, in his providence, led him to the opening
</p>
<p>of a vista through which his patriotic and philanthropic soul could
</p>
<p>swell with delightful anticipations of the greatness, the glory, and the
</p>
<p>happiness that should accrue- to mankind through his faithfulness
</p>
<p>to the obligations of his official oath, by which he had vindicated
</p>
<p>his authority, and brought to a right solution the great moral ques-
</p>
<p>tion underlying the contest, and thus had made our beloved land

</p>
<p>a land of freedom in fact, as well as in name. He saw a new and
</p>
<p>glorious era about to dawn on his country. Like Moses, however,
</p>
<p>he was only permitted, in vision, to look over into the promised
</p>
<p>land the great future of his beloved country.
</p>
<p>36 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>It is consoling to thus know that to the great Lincoln his last
</p>
<p>day on earth was the happiest, and at the same time, the meekest
</p>
<p>day of his life. His biographers, Nicolay and Hay, who were
</p>
<p>able to write from personal association with, and observation of,
</p>
<p>this great man, inform us that on this day his soul was filled with
</p>
<p>the kindliest feelings toward his enemies, and in his last conference
</p>
<p>with his cabinet his policy of dealing with them was shadowed
</p>
<p>forth as free from feelings of revenge or desire for the punishment
</p>
<p>of any. He desired that no man should lose his life for the part
</p>
<p>he had taken in the rebellion. He held " malice toward none,"
</p>
<p>and was filled with " charity for all." His passage from time to
</p>
<p>eternity, though brought about by the bullet of an assassin, was
</p>
<p>a passage through a triumphal arch, whose further portal was the
</p>
<p>gate of heaven.
</p>
<p>The presence of General Grant was known to the city, and it
</p>
<p>was noised abroad that both he and President Lincoln would
</p>
<p>honor the theatre with their presence on that evening. The
</p>
<p>public knowledge of this fact was calculated to bring out a
</p>
<p>brilliant and large assemblage of people. The loyal citizens
</p>
<p>would be there to give to the President and the successful and
</p>
<p>popular commander of his armies in the field a heartfelt and
</p>
<p>royal ovation in this the hour of their triumph. All felt happy
</p>
<p>and secure. That they were coming together to witness, on that
</p>
<p>night, the awful tragedy of the assassination of the nation's head,
</p>
<p>President Lincoln, was not dreamed of by any except those who
</p>
<p>had made every preparation in advance for accomplishing the
</p>
<p>murderous plot, and who were stealthily slipping about through
</p>
<p>the assembling crowds, like fiends, to assure themselves that
</p>
<p>every arrangement for the successful accomplishment of their
</p>
<p>hellish purpose was complete. During the day General Grant
</p>
<p>received a telegram that called him to Philadelphia on business,
</p>
<p>and owing to this apparently providential circumstance he was
</p>
<p>prevented from accompanying the President to the theatre on that

</p>
<p>eventful night, and also, in all probability, from being, with the
</p>
<p>President, a victim of the plot, in which there is good reason to
</p>
<p>conclude, from all the evidence, his life was included, and that
</p>
<p>for him an assassin had been provided.
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. 37
</p>
<p>In lieu of General and Mrs. Grant, President Lincoln had taken
</p>
<p>Major Rathbone and Miss Harris, the step-son and daughter of
</p>
<p>Senator Harris, of New York, into the Presidential party. On
</p>
<p>reaching the theatre at a somewhat late hour, and after the play
</p>
<p>had commenced, as soon as the presence of the President became
</p>
<p>known, the actors stopped playing, the band struck up " Hail to
</p>
<p>the Chief," and the audience rose and received him with vociferous
</p>
<p>cheering.
</p>
<p>The party proceeded along the rear of the dress circle, and
</p>
<p>entered the box that had been prepared for them, the President
</p>
<p>taking the rocking chair that had been placed there for him on
</p>
<p>the left of the box, and nearest to the audience, about four feet
</p>
<p>from the door of entrance to the box. Major Rathbone and the
</p>
<p>ladies found seats on the President's right. During this time the
</p>
<p>conspirators were on the alert, scanning the situation, passing about
</p>
<p>so as to keep up a communication with each other, in preparation
</p>
<p>for their work. Booth had arranged with Payne to assassinate
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward at the same time that he would assassinate the
</p>
<p>President ; and no doubt had planned for Payne, after accomplish-
</p>
<p>ing his task, to join him and Herold in their flight, crossing the
</p>
<p>Eastern Branch at the Navy Yard bridge, and then to pass down
</p>
<p>through Maryland and cross the Potomac, at a selected point, into
</p>
<p>Virginia, where they might consider themselves as being safe
</p>
<p>amongst their friends. Secretary Seward was known to have
</p>
<p>received severe injuries from the upsetting of his carriage, and
</p>
<p>to be lying in a critical condition under the care of Dr. Verdi.
</p>
<p>Booth had planned to take advantage of this circumstance for
</p>
<p>gaining admittance for Payne into the sick chamber, where, by
</p>
<p>springing with the ferocity of a tiger upon the sick man, he might
</p>
<p>make quick work in dispatching him with his dagger. To this
</p>
<p>end he had prepared a package rolled up in paper, and had
</p>
<p>schooled Payne in the artifice, teaching him to represent himself as
</p>
<p>having been sent by Dr. Verdi with this package of medicine, which

</p>
<p>it was necessary he should deliver in person, as he had important
</p>
<p>verbal directions as to the manner of its use, which required him
</p>
<p>to see the Secretary.
</p>
<p>About ten o'clock Booth rode up the alley back of the theatre
</p>
<p>38 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>where he had been accustomed to keep his horse, and having
</p>
<p>reached the rear entrance, called for Ned three times, each time
</p>
<p>a little louder than before. At the third call Ned Spangler
</p>
<p>answered to his summons by appearing at the door. Booth's first
</p>
<p>salutation was in the form of a question : " Ned, you will help me
</p>
<p>all you can, won't you?" To which Spangler replied, "Oh,
</p>
<p>yes ! " Booth then requested him to send " Peanuts " (a boy
</p>
<p>employed about the theatre), to hold his horse. Spangler gave
</p>
<p>the boy orders to do this, and upon the boy making the objection
</p>
<p>that he might be out of place at the time he had a duty to per-
</p>
<p>form, Spangler bade him go, saying that he would stand responsi-
</p>
<p>ble for him. The boy then took the reins, and held the horse for
</p>
<p>about half an hour, until Booth returned to reward him with a
</p>
<p>curse and a kick, as he jerked the rein from him preparatory to
</p>
<p>remounting for his flight. After entering the theatre, Booth
</p>
<p>passed rapidly across the stage, glancing at the box occupied by
</p>
<p>his intended victim, and looking up his accomplices, he passed
</p>
<p>out of the front door on to the walk where he was met by two of
</p>
<p>his fellow conspirators. One of these was a low, villainous-look-
</p>
<p>ing fellow, whilst the other was a very neatly-dressed man. Booth
</p>
<p>held a private conference with these by the door where he and the
</p>
<p>vulgar-looking fellow had stationed themselves. The neatly-
</p>
<p>dressed man crossed the walk to the rear of the President's car-
</p>
<p>riage and peeped into it. One of the witnesses, who was sitting
</p>
<p>on the platform in front of the theatre, had his attention arrested
</p>
<p>by the manner and conduct of these men, and so watched them
</p>
<p>very closely.
</p>
<p>It was at the close of the second act that Booth and his two
</p>
<p>fellow conspirators appeared at the door. Booth said, " I think
</p>
<p>he will come down now"; and they alligned themselves to await
</p>
<p>his coming. Their communications with each other were in
</p>
<p>whispered tones. Finding that the President would remain until
</p>
<p>the close of the play, they then began to prepare to assassinate

</p>
<p>him in the theatre. The neatly-dressed man called the time three
</p>
<p>times in succession at short intervals, each time a little louder
</p>
<p>than before. Booth now entered the saloon, took a drink of
</p>
<p>whiskey, and then went at once into the theatre. He passed
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. 39
</p>
<p>quickly along next to the wall behind the chairs, and having
</p>
<p>reached a point near the door that led to the passage behind the
</p>
<p>box, he stopped, took a small pack of visiting cards from his
</p>
<p>pocket, selected one and replaced the others ; stood a second with it
</p>
<p>in his hand, and then showed it to the President's messenger, who
</p>
<p>was sitting just below him, and then, without waiting, passed
</p>
<p>through the door from the lobby into the passage, closing and
</p>
<p>barring it after him. Taking a hasty, but careful, look through
</p>
<p>the hole which he had had made in the door for the purpose of
</p>
<p>assuring himself of the President's position, and cocking his pistol
</p>
<p>and with his finger on the trigger, he pulled open the door, and
</p>
<p>stealthily entered the box, where he stood right behind and within
</p>
<p>three feet of the President. The play had advanced to the second
</p>
<p>scene of the third act, and whilst the audience was intensely in-
</p>
<p>terested Booth fired the fatal shot the ball penetrating the
</p>
<p>skull on the back of the left side of the head, inflicting a wound in
</p>
<p>the brain (the ball passing entirely through and lodging behind
</p>
<p>the right eye), of which he died at about half-past seven o'clock
</p>
<p>on the morning of the fifteenth. He was unconscious from the
</p>
<p>moment he was struck until his spirit passed from earth. An
</p>
<p>unspeakable calm settled on that remarkable face, leaving the
</p>
<p>impress of a happy soul on the casket it had left behind.
</p>
<p>Thus died the man who said, " Senator Douglass says he don't
</p>
<p>care whether slavery is voted up, or voted down ; but God cares,
</p>
<p>and humanity cares, and I care."
</p>
<p>As soon as Booth had fired his pistol, and was satisfied that his
</p>
<p>end was accomplished, he cried out, " Revenge for the South ! "
</p>
<p>and throwing his pistol down, he took his dagger in his right
</p>
<p>hand, and placed his left hand on the balustrade preparatory to
</p>
<p>his leap of twelve feet to the stage. Just at this moment Major
</p>
<p>Rathbone sprang forward and tried to catch him. In this he
</p>
<p>failed, but received a severe cut in his arm from a back-handed
</p>
<p>thrust of Booth's dagger. Time was everything now to the

</p>
<p>assassin. He must make good his escape whilst the audience
</p>
<p>stood dazed, and before it had time to comprehend clearly what
</p>
<p>had happened. With his left hand on the railing, he boldly
</p>
<p>leaped from the box to the stage. The front of the box had been
</p>
<p>4O ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>draped for the occasion with the American flag, which was
</p>
<p>stretched across its front, and reached down nearly or quite to the
</p>
<p>floor. In the descent, Booth's spur caught in the flag, tearing out
</p>
<p>a piece which he dragged nearly half way across the stage. The
</p>
<p>flag, however, was avenged for this double insult which he had put
</p>
<p>upon it ; for by this entanglement his descent was deflected, caus-
</p>
<p>ing him to strike the stage obliquely, and partially to fall, thus
</p>
<p>fracturing the fibula of his left leg, on account of which injury
</p>
<p>his flight was impeded, and his permanent escape made impossi-
</p>
<p>ble. As he recovered himself from his partial fall and started to-
</p>
<p>run across the stage with his dagger brandished aloft, he cried out
</p>
<p>in a theatrical tone, " Sic semper tyrannis! " and quickly passed
</p>
<p>out at a little back door opening into the alley where he had left
</p>
<p>his horse, and, though closely pursued, succeeded in mounting,
</p>
<p>and rode rapidly away.
</p>
<p>Of course he could not afford to run any risks in regard to his
</p>
<p>escape, and for all this he had made his arrangements in advance.
</p>
<p>Spangler had faithfully redeemed his promise to render him all
</p>
<p>the aid he could by keeping the passage to the door clear at the
</p>
<p>critical moment, and also by doing all he could to retard pursuit.
</p>
<p>When a fellow-employee cried out, "That was Booth ! " Ned ordered
</p>
<p>him to shut up, saying " You don't know who it was." Booth
</p>
<p>was closely pursued by a man by the name of Stewart, who fol-
</p>
<p>lowed him into the alley, making every effort he could to stop
</p>
<p>him ; but Booth kept his horse in motion, so that Stewart failed
</p>
<p>to get hold of the rein, and the assassin was soon off at a rapid
</p>
<p>pace.
</p>
<p>Stewart testified that Spangler, or a man resembling him, stood
</p>
<p>near the door, and could have prevented Booth's exit had he been
</p>
<p>so disposed. It is evident his purpose was to aid, rather than
</p>
<p>hinder, his escape. All the occupants of the stage, actors and
</p>
<p>assistants, male and female, were in a state of confusion and
</p>
<p>intense excitement except this man, who evidently had not been

</p>
<p>taken by surprise, but was prepared in mind for what had
</p>
<p>happened, and had played his part in the tragedy.
</p>
<p>At the same hour that Booth fired the fatal shot, Payne
</p>
<p>appeared at the door of Secretary Seward's house, in the guise
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. 41
</p>
<p>of a messenger from Dr. Verdi, holding in his hand the package
</p>
<p>that Booth had prepared for him, and demanded to see the
</p>
<p>Secretary, saying that he had a verbal message which was of
</p>
<p>particular importance in regard to the use, or application of, the
</p>
<p>medicine, and that he must see the Secretary himself. Dr. Verdi
</p>
<p>had left his patient but a short time previous, and had consoled
</p>
<p>the family that had for days been suffering the greatest anxiety on
</p>
<p>account of the Secretary's condition by taking a favorable view of
</p>
<p>the symptoms. The family, worn with watching and anxiety, were
</p>
<p>disposing of themselves for the night. Major A. H. Seward had
</p>
<p>retired to his room. Sergeant George F. Robinson, acting as attend-
</p>
<p>ant nurse, was watching by the bedside, in company with Miss
</p>
<p>Seward, the Secretary's daughter. Frederick Seward occupied the
</p>
<p>room at the head of the stairs. All the rooms occupied by the
</p>
<p>Secretary and his family were on the second floor, and were reached
</p>
<p>by a flight of stairs in the hallway.
</p>
<p>The second waiter, William H. Bell, a colored lad of nineteen,
</p>
<p>was stationed at the hall door. Being somewhat relieved of their
</p>
<p>anxiety by the doctor's favorable view of the case, all were
</p>
<p>anticipating a night of quiet rest. The door bell rang, and was
</p>
<p>responded to by Bell, the colored waiter. Immediately upon his
</p>
<p>opening of the door, Payne stepped into the hall. He was a tall,
</p>
<p>broad-shouldered, muscular man, as agile and ferocious as a
</p>
<p>panther; a low-browed, scowling, villainous-looking specimen of
</p>
<p>humanity, the animal preponderating largely in every feature of
</p>
<p>his visage and expression of his countenance. There he stood,
</p>
<p>holding in his left hand the package, and keeping his right hand
</p>
<p>in his overcoat pocket. He demanded of the boy to be allowed
</p>
<p>to see the Secretary, telling his story about being sent by Dr.
</p>
<p>Verdi to deliver the medicine with his directions. The porter told
</p>

<p>Payne would not consent, but persisted in saying that he must see

<p>Mr. Seward. After considerable parleying, he started up stairs,
</p>
<p>and the porter, seeing that he would go, and thinking that he
</p>
<p>might complain of his conduct to the Secretary, asked him to
</p>
<p>pardon him, to which Payne replied, " O, I know, that's all right."
</p>
<p>42 ASSASSfNA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>He was wearing heavy boots, and took no pains to walk lightly
</p>
<p>as he went up the stairs, whereupon the porter requested him
</p>
<p>not to make so much noise, to which, however, he paid no atten-
</p>
<p>tion. As he approached the head of the stairs, he was met by
</p>
<p>Mr. Frederick Seward, who had been attracted by the noise, to
</p>
<p>whom he said, " I want to see Mr. Seward." Frederick went into
</p>
<p>his father's room, and finding him asleep, returned saying, " You
</p>
<p>cannot see him." All this time Payne stood holding out the pack-
</p>
<p>age in his left hand, grasping with his right hand the pistol in his
</p>
<p>overcoat pocket. Frederick requested him to give him the pack-
</p>
<p>age, saying he would deliver it ; but Payne persisted in saying that
</p>
<p>that would not do ; he must see Mr. Seward, he must see him.
</p>
<p>Frederick finally said, " I am the proprietor here, and -his son ;
</p>
<p>if you cannot leave your message with me, you cannot leave it at
</p>
<p>all." Payne still continued parleying with Frederick for some
</p>
<p>time ; but finding that his talking availed nothing, he started as if
</p>
<p>to go down stairs. This, however, was only a feint on his part in
</p>
<p>order to throw Frederick off of his guard and to get rid of the
</p>
<p>porter who stood behind him. He again walked so heavily that
</p>
<p>the porter requested him not to make so much noise ; but at that
</p>
<p>moment, Payne, having prepared himself for the encounter, turned
</p>
<p>quickly, and making a spring towards Frederick, struck him two
</p>
<p>or three times with the pistol, which he had all the time held in
</p>
<p>his hand, fracturing his skull and knocking him senseless to the
</p>
<p>floor. Having learned which was the room occupied by the
</p>
<p>invalid by seeing Frederick go into it, Payne rushed past
</p>
<p>the prostrate man, opened the door of the Secretary's room, and
</p>
<p>was met by Sergeant Robinson. Having broken and thrown
</p>
<p>down his revolver in his encounter with Frederick, he had drawn
</p>
<p>his dagger, and at his first encounter with the sergeant he struck
</p>
<p>him with his knife, cutting an ugly gash in his forehead, and
</p>
<p>partially knocking him down. He then pressed rapidly fonvard,
</p>
<p>knife in hand, to where the invalid lay in his bed. Throwing

</p>
<p>himself upon him, he commenced striking at his face and neck
</p>
<p>with his dagger. The Secretary was reclining in a half-sitting
</p>
<p>posture, having the coverings well drawn up about his neck
</p>
<p>and chin, to which circumstance the failure of the would-be
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. 43
</p>
<p>assassin to take his life was no doubt due. The sergeant, as soon
</p>
<p>as he recovered his equilibrium, sprang upon Payne, and Major
</p>
<p>Seward, having been awakened by the screams of his sister, sprang
</p>
<p>into the room in his night-dress. Finding the sergeant grappling
</p>
<p>him in such a way as to hinder the effectiveness of his thrusts at
</p>
<p>the Secretary, and probably thinking that he had accomplished his
</p>
<p>purpose, he turned his attention toward making his escape. In
</p>
<p>disentangling himself from the grasp of the two men who now had
</p>
<p>hold of him, he gave to Major Seward several severe cuts about
</p>
<p>the head and face, crying all the time, " I am mad ! I am mad ! "
</p>
<p>Finally, pulling himself loose, he started to make his way to the
</p>
<p>street. Meeting a Mr. Emrick W. Hansel, another nurse, on the
</p>
<p>stairs, he made a thrust at him with his knife, inflicting an ugly
</p>
<p>wound. He now left the house, leaving five of its inmates
</p>
<p>stabbed, cut, and bleeding behind him. Having reached the
</p>
<p>street, he deliberately threw his dagger away, mounted the horse
</p>
<p>which he had hitched in front of the door, and rode off. Thus,
</p>
<p>for the time being, this inhuman monster passed from sight, hav-
</p>
<p>ing made good his retreat minus his dagger, hat, and revolver.
</p>
<p>He was not a moment too soon in withdrawing from the house.
</p>
<p>The colored porter, as soon as he saw the violence done to
</p>
<p>Frederick Seward at the head of the stairs, ran down and out into
</p>
<p>the street with the cry of " murder," and did not stop until he
</p>
<p>reached General Angur's headquarters, where he reported the
</p>
<p>occurrence and ran back immediately, accompanied by two or
</p>
<p>three soldiers. They reached the house just in time to see Payne
</p>
<p>mount his horse and ride away. He was followed some distance
</p>
<p>by the porter, who kept nearly up with him for some time, as he
</p>
<p>rode slowly at first, but he then mended his pace, and was soon
</p>
<p>out of sight. The soldiers, having no orders and not compre-
</p>
<p>hending the situation, made no effort to stop him, although the
</p>
<p>colored boy who gave the alarm, and who preceded them, pointed
</p>
<p>him out to them as the man who had so ruthlessly broken the

</p>
<p>quiet of that house and produced such consternation amongst its
</p>
<p>peaceful inmates.
</p>
<p>Although Payne rode away so leisurely at the start, he put his
</p>
<p>horse to the top of his speed as soon as he had fairly cleared the
</p>
<p>44 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>streets and reached the suburbs of the city. About two hours
</p>
<p>later, a bay horse, saddled, and blind of an eye, came running
</p>
<p>up a by-road that led to Camp Barry, about three-fourths of a
</p>
<p>mile east of the capitol, and was there halted and taken charge of
</p>
<p>and placed in General Angur's stables. The horse, when found,
</p>
<p>bore marks of having been ridden at a furious rate. The sweat
</p>
<p>was streaming from every pore and dripping to the ground. This
</p>
<p>proved to be the bay horse that Booth had bought from Gardner,
</p>
<p>the neighbor of Dr. Mudd, in November, 1864, and which he sold
</p>
<p>to his co-conspirator, Arnold, in January, 1865, according to his
</p>
<p>own statement made some time before the assassination.
</p>
<p>This was no doubt the horse rode by Payne on that night. The
</p>
<p>most probable theory is, that being pushed and urged at a furious
</p>
<p>rate, and being blind of an eye, he stumbled and pitched headlong,
</p>
<p>throwing, and probably stunning, his rider, after which he regained
</p>
<p>his footing and made his escape before Payne had sufficiently
</p>
<p>recovered to get hold of him. The fact of his being a little lame
</p>
<p>when caught goes to sustain this theory. Thus was the would-be
</p>
<p>assassin prevented from joining his comrades, Booth and Herold,
</p>
<p>in their flight, and compelled to skulk and hide in the suburbs of
</p>
<p>the city for the next two days. He was without arms and hatless,
</p>
<p>and was compelled to throw away his overcoat, which was after-
</p>
<p>wards found, on account of the bloodstains on its sleeves. He
</p>
<p>knew that the alarm would spread rapidly throughout the vicinity,
</p>
<p>and in his present condition he dared not venture out through the
</p>
<p>country, so he was compelled to spend the time in hiding and
</p>
<p>skulking until he was forced from his retreat by hunger. Making
</p>
<p>a covering for his head out of a sleeve from his under-shirt, which
</p>
<p>he drew over it like a turban, he shouldered a pick, which he had
</p>
<p>stolen from the trenches, and at near the hour of midnight on the
</p>
<p>i /th he entered the city. He went directly to the house of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, as the safest place he could find to rest, hide, and refresh
</p>
<p>himself, and obtain an outfit in which he might make his escape.

<p>Here he felt that he could trust the secret of his presence. Un-
</p>
<p>fortunately for him, as well as for Mrs. Surratt, the government
</p>
<p>had by this time come into possession of such information as
</p>
<p>justified it in sending its military police to that house, with
</p>
<p>orders to arrest its inmates.
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. 45
</p>
<p>It had been discovered that the house of Mrs. Surratt had been the
</p>
<p>headquarters of the conspirators in Washington City. The officer
</p>
<p>in charge of the police, Major H. W. Smith, had reached the
</p>
<p>house but a short time before Payne arrived. Payne came with
</p>
<p>his turban on his head, and the pick on his shoulder, and rang the
</p>
<p>door-bell. Major Smith responded to the bell, and asked him to
</p>
<p>come in. Seeing the officer, he said he believed he was mistaken
</p>
<p>in the house. Being asked whose house he sought, he replied,
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Surratt's." The officer replied, " This is the place," and
</p>
<p>drawing his revolver on him, ordered him to come in. Payne
</p>
<p>entered, and the officer closed the door. He then inquired who
</p>
<p>he was, and what he wanted. To these questions he replied that
</p>
<p>he was a poor man, and a laborer, and that Mrs. Surratt had sent
</p>
<p>for him to dig a drain for her. On being asked what brought
</p>
<p>him there at that time of night, he replied that he " merely called
</p>
<p>to see what time Mrs. Surratt wanted him to go to work in the
</p>
<p>morning." The officer saw that his hands bore no marks of labor,
</p>
<p>and at once suspected he had caged one of the conspirators. He
</p>
<p>placed him under arrest and took him along with the others in the
</p>
<p>house, to General Angur's head-quarters, where he was held for
</p>
<p>identification. William H. Bell, the colored boy who was second
</p>
<p>waiter at Mr. Seward's, being sent for, at once unhesitatingly
</p>
<p>identified him as the man who had produced such consternation
</p>
<p>in the house of Mr. Seward, on the night of the I4th, by his
</p>
<p>determined efforts to take the Secretary's life. Lewis Payne,
</p>
<p>having been thus captured and identified, and Mrs. Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt, were the first amongst the conspirators to be held for
</p>
<p>trial.
</p>
<p>After the attack at Secretary Seward's, Dr. Verdi and two or
</p>
<p>three other surgeons were at once called to examine and treat the
</p>
<p>Secretary and the other victims of Payne's dagger. The. house in
</p>
<p>which the onslaught was made had the appearance of a charnal
</p>
<p>house or slaughter-pen. The Secretary was found to have received

<p>made dangerous by the loss of blood they had occasioned and the

</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>THE NEWS COMMUNICATED TO THE WORLD, AND ITS EFFECT.
</p>
<p>ON the morning of the I5th of April, 1865, the telegraph wires
</p>
<p>carried to every part of the United States that was in communi-
</p>
<p>cation with Washington, and to the rest of the civilized world, the
</p>
<p>astounding intelligence that Abraham Lincoln, President of the
</p>
<p>United States, had been assassinated on the previous night by
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, at Ford's Theatre in Washington City ; that at
</p>
<p>the same hour a most savage attempt had been made to assassinate
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State, Hon. William H. Seward, and that he was
</p>
<p>lying in a most critical and dangerous condition from the wounds
</p>
<p>which he had received, and would probably die. Never, perhaps,
</p>
<p>in the history of the race were so many hearts bleeding, and so
</p>
<p>many eyes suffused with tears at one time, as on that sorrowful
</p>
<p>day. The nation was rilled with grief, mingled with indignation
</p>
<p>and horror at the deed. The land was literally draped in mourn-
</p>
<p>ing. Every city, and every town and village, displayed the sable
</p>
<p>habiliments of grief. The response came back to our people, in
</p>
<p>kind, from every civilized people on earth.
</p>
<p>The writer was at the time a member of Grant's victorious
</p>
<p>army, and had large opportunities for witnessing the effects pro-
</p>
<p>duced by the sad intelligence on the soldiery of our country.
</p>
<p>From the highest officers down to the rank and file of the army,
</p>
<p>sorrow and grief were depicted on every countenance. From
</p>
<p>Appomattox to Richmond the victorious army that had been
</p>
<p>filled with joyful and hopeful anticipations over its successes, and
</p>
<p>the prospect of the speedy dawn of peace, and of returning to
</p>
<p>their homes and friends and to the pursuits of peaceful life, after
</p>
<p>four years of arduous military service, was at once plunged into
</p>
<p>the deepest sadness and gloom. Strong men wept. It was as

<p>47
</p>
<p>48 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>though every soldier had lost his dearest friend. There was
</p>
<p>always a day of sadness in the army after every great battle, even
</p>
<p>in the triumphs of victory, at the thought of the many brave
</p>
<p>comrades who had given up their lives for their country, and
</p>
<p>would never again be seen in the ranks, who were even then
</p>
<p>being gathered up from the field and carefully laid away in silence
</p>
<p>to await the resurrection morn ; and of the others, who with loss
</p>
<p>of limbs and fearful wounds, were receiving the care of the
</p>
<p>surgeons and nurses in the hospitals improvised for the occasion ;
</p>
<p>but never before had such a pall of grief been thrown over the
</p>
<p>entire army.
</p>
<p>The depth of sorrow into which the nation was plunged by the
</p>
<p>news of his assassination revealed, as nothing else could have
</p>
<p>done, the place Abraham Lincoln held in the confidence and
</p>
<p>affections of the loyal people of the land. The first shock of the
</p>
<p>sad intelligence was almost paralytic. The people even the
</p>
<p>army for the moment stood dazed and bewildered. What was
</p>
<p>the meaning of all this? Was the war to be prolonged? Were
</p>
<p>we now to be called upon to turn our victorious arms upon the
</p>
<p>enemy in the rear, of whose existence we had all the time been
</p>
<p>conscious? Such were the questions that first suggested them-
</p>
<p>selves. If so, the army was then in a state of mind to have made
</p>
<p>a short work of it. The victory over our armed foe in front, who
</p>
<p>had so bravely met us, and often with success, on many a hotly-
</p>
<p>contested field, would never have been yielded to the disloyal
</p>
<p>cowards who, through all of these years of the war, from their safe
</p>
<p>retreats and hiding-places, threw every obstacle they could in the
</p>
<p>way of our now martyred President, and who had planned and
</p>
<p>accomplished his taking off.
</p>
<p>The extent of the conspiracy had not as yet been revealed ; but
</p>
<p>enough was known to the government to evince the fact that this
</p>
<p>was an act of deep political significance, having behind it a very
</p>
<p>different class of men from the dissolute and depraved assassins

</p>
<p>who were executing their behests, and not merely done for the
</p>
<p>gratification of personal and political revenge. It was obvious
</p>
<p>that the occasion called for the most vigorous and decided
</p>
<p>measures on the part of the government to meet and overcome
</p>
<p>THE NEWS COMMUNICATED TO THE WORLD. 49
</p>
<p>the strategy of assassinations just now entered upon. It very
</p>
<p>soon became known to the authorities that the plot had been but
</p>
<p>very partially executed, and that the purpose of the conspirators
</p>
<p>was to subvert the constitution by depriving the nation of its
</p>
<p>executive head, and leaving no constitutional way of electing a
</p>
<p>new President, and at the same time to deprive the armies in the
</p>
<p>field of a lawful commander. To accomplish this, the President,
</p>
<p>Vice-President, Secretary of State, and General Grant were all to
</p>
<p>have been assassinated. The conspirators in Canada and also the
</p>
<p>rebel president, when they heard that only President Lincoln had
</p>
<p>been killed, could not conceal their disappointment, and virtually
</p>
<p>confessed that their deep-laid scheme had proven a failure. The
</p>
<p>former still adhered to their purpose, and in their rage declared,
</p>
<p>" We are not done with them yet." We hardly dare to venture
</p>
<p>upon the consideration of what would have been the result had
</p>
<p>they completed the work they had planned. We have reason for
</p>
<p>profound thankfulness to that God who has thus far so wisely and
</p>
<p>graciously watched over our national progress, that he did not
</p>
<p>permit its accomplishment. But we, who were actors on the
</p>
<p>stage at that time, knowing how the principal actors in our
</p>
<p>national affairs, both civil and military, had been schooled in self-
</p>
<p>sacrificing, patriotic devotion to the institutions of our fathers, and
</p>
<p>their unfaltering purpose to transmit them unimpaired to their
</p>
<p>children and children's children for a perpetual inheritance, can
</p>
<p>but feel assured that even in the dire extremity now under consid-
</p>
<p>eration they would have proven true to their trust, and would
</p>
<p>have found a way to restore all of the machinery of government
</p>
<p>provided for in the Constitution. The people are above the
</p>
<p>Constitution even as the maker is above the thing made.
</p>
<p>The rebel armies had been so completely overcome that they
</p>
<p>could no longer have formed even a nucleus around which the
</p>
<p>traitors in the North could have organized an opposition that could
</p>
<p>have been regarded with other than feelings of contempt by our

</p>
<p>victorious hosts. The time had passed ; the opportunity was gone.
</p>
<p>No wonder the conspirators in Canada gnashed their teeth with
</p>
<p>rage and disappointment because " the boys had not been allowed
</p>
<p>to act when they wanted to." They had amongst their many

</p>
<p>schemes concocted during the summer of 1864, such as making
</p>
<p>raids, liberating rebel prisoners of war held in Northern prisons,
</p>
<p>burning cities, spreading pestilence, and poisoning reservoirs, been
</p>
<p>led also to consider this scheme of assassinations. All of these
</p>
<p>things were to be done in aid of the rebellion.
</p>
<p>As their cause became desperate on account of the continued
</p>
<p>success of our arms, so did they become desperate in planning to
</p>
<p>retrieve. As early as January, 1865, they received a communica-
</p>
<p>tion from Jefferson Davis suggesting these things and urging them
</p>
<p>to stop at nothing, however desperate, and plainly intimating that
</p>
<p>Lincoln ought not to be allowed to live ; but it was not until the latter
</p>
<p>part of March, 1865, that they were prepared to present to him a
</p>
<p>definitely-prepared plan for the accomplishment of their purposes
</p>
<p>that he could accept and sanction. They had thus been long
</p>
<p>delayed, and now they were compelled to realize that their work
</p>
<p>was a failure. No wonder that they all, from Jefferson Davis down,
</p>
<p>felt and expressed grievous disappointment. It reminds us of

<p>Milton's description of the malignant schemes, failures, disappoint-
</p>
<p>ments, and rage of the Prince of Devils in his contests with the

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE PLOT. PURSUIT AND CAPTURE OF BOOTH
</p>
<p>AND HEROLD. DEATH OF BOOTH.
</p>
<p>THE most active measures were at onde resorted to by the
</p>
<p>government to discover the conspirators, and to capture all who
</p>
<p>could be found of those engaged in it. The civil and military
</p>
<p>police, as also those engaged in the secret service of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, were at once set to work. It was soon learned that Booth
</p>
<p>and a co-conspirator, which proved to be Herold, had passed over
</p>
<p>the navy-yard bridge, on horseback, very shortly after the hour
</p>
<p>at which the fatal shot had been fired, and were fleeing toward
</p>
<p>Surrattsville and Bryantown in Maryland. They had been allowed
</p>
<p>to pass by the sentinel at the bridge, having represented them-
</p>
<p>selves as citizens on their way to their homes. Booth was first at
</p>
<p>the bridge, and gave his true name to the sentinel, saying that he
</p>
<p>lived close to Beautown. Five minutes later Herold came and
</p>
<p>gave his name as Smith, saying that he lived at White Plains and
</p>
<p>was on his way home. Having gotten safely on the road, they
</p>
<p>directly joined company, and pushed on rapidly, arriving at
</p>
<p>Surrattsville about midnight.
</p>
<p>Stopping at Lloyd's tavern in Surrattsville, Herold dismounted
</p>
<p>and went into the house, saying to Lloyd, " For God's sake, make
</p>
<p>haste and get those things ! " Lloyd, understanding what he
</p>
<p>wanted from the notification given him by Mrs. Surratt on the
</p>
<p>evening previous, without making any reply, went and got the
</p>
<p>carbines, which he had placed in his bedroom that they might be
</p>
<p>handy, and brought them to Herold, together with the ammunition
</p>
<p>and field-glass that had been deposited with him, and the two
</p>
<p>bottles of whiskey that Booth had ordered through Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>the evening before. Herold carried out to Booth one of the bottles

<p>of whiskey, drinking from his own bottle in the house before going
</p>
<p>out. Booth declined taking his carbine, saying his leg was broken
</p>
<p>and he could not carry it. As they were about leaving, Booth
</p>
<p>said to Lloyd, " I will tell you some news if you want to hear it " ;
</p>
<p>and then went on to say, " I am pretty certain that we have assas-
</p>
<p>sinated the President and Secretary Seward." The moon was
</p>
<p>now up and shining brightly, and the two confessed criminals
</p>
<p>resumed their flight. The next heard of them was at the house
</p>
<p>of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, near Bryantown, in Maryland, and about
</p>
<p>thirty miles from Washington, where they arrived at about four
</p>
<p>o'clock on the morning of the I5th, having travelled at the rate of
</p>
<p>six miles per hour.
</p>
<p>Booth's leg had been broken by a fracture of the fibula, or
</p>
<p>small bone of the leg, when he fell on the stage on leaping from
</p>
<p>the President's box, and by this time had become very painful.
</p>
<p>He greatly needed the support of a splint, and quiet as well. He
</p>
<p>was in a position, however, to get neither ; for although he had
</p>
<p>reached the house of a co-conspirator, who was a country doctor,
</p>
<p>and well disposed to render him all the aid he could, he appears
</p>
<p>to have made a very bungling out, dressing the broken limb
</p>
<p>with some pasteboard and a bandage that .gave but a very imper-
</p>
<p>fect support. As to the rest he required, that was impossible,
</p>
<p>for although Mudd placed him in an upstairs room and kept him
</p>
<p>until the afternoon, they were admonished by seeing a squad of
</p>
<p>soldiers under Lieutenant Dana passing down past Mudd's place,
</p>
<p>which was a quarter of a mile off the road to Bryantown, that there
</p>
<p>was no rest for the wicked ; and as quickly as it could be done
</p>
<p>after the soldiers passed, Mudd got rid of his dangerous charge
</p>
<p>by sending them by an unfrequented route to the house of his friend
</p>
<p>and neighbor, Samuel Cox, about six miles nearer to the Poto-
</p>
<p>mac. Booth was on no new ground, neither amongst strangers
</p>
<p>either to his person or to his wicked purpose. He had spent a
</p>
<p>good deal of his time during the previous fall in that part of

<p>country with a desire to purchase lands, he had perfected all his
</p>
<p>arrangements, and had expected to pass swiftly over his route,
</p>
<p>accompanied by Atzerodt (whose home was in this neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood, and who knew all about the contraband trade with the
</p>
<p>rebel capital, the underground mail route between Richmond and
</p>
<p>Washington, and all of the people engaged in these operations,
</p>
<p>and also the place and facilities for crossing the Potomac), and
</p>
<p>also by Payne and Herold. He had purposed to be safe ( on the
</p>
<p>soil of the Old Dominion e'er this time. Instead of realizing all
</p>
<p>this, he found himself a cripple, scarcely able to travel, and closely
</p>
<p>pursued by those whom he knew to be on his trail, with no other
</p>
<p>companion than his 'devoted but inefficient friend, Herold; and
</p>
<p>thus he was compelled to realize that
</p>
<p>"The best laid schemes o' mice and men
</p>
<p>Gang aft aglee;
</p>
<p>And lea' us nought but grief and pain
</p>
<p>For promised joy."
</p>
<p>Mudd had done all he could to relieve him, but dare not try to
</p>
<p>conceal and keep him. He could only forward him to the next
</p>
<p>stage of his journey and to a safe place of concealment. This he
</p>
<p>faithfully did. Cox lived near Port Tobacco, the home of
</p>
<p>Atzerodt ; and as his was too public a place to afford safety to the
</p>
<p>fugitives, he turned them over to his neighbor, Thomas Jones, a
</p>
<p>contraband trader between Maryland and Richmond, who, in the
</p>
<p>midst of a constant scouring of the country by pursuing parties,
</p>
<p>kept his charge concealed in the woods near his house, supplying
</p>
<p>them with food and doing everything he could for their comfort,
</p>
<p>waiting and watching constantly to find an opportunity to get
</p>
<p>them across the Potomac. They were hunted so closely that they
</p>
<p>could hear the neighing of the horses of the troopers, and fearing
</p>
<p>they might be betrayed by their horses answering the calls,
</p>
<p>Herold led them into a swamp near where they lay concealed in
</p>
<p>the pines and shot them.

</p>
<p>The river was being continually patroled by gun-boats, and the
</p>
<p>task of getting his wards across proved both difficult and
</p>
<p>dangerous to Jones. The proclamation of the Secretary of War,
</p>
<p>offering one hundred thousand dollars for the capture of Booth,
</p>
<p>54 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>and warning all persons from aiding the fugitives in any way in
</p>
<p>making their escape, had been published broadcast, yet Jones was
</p>
<p>true to his trust. Neither the offered rewards nor the warnings
</p>
<p>of the proclamation had any effect on him ; but for a whole week
</p>
<p>he kept them secreted in the pines on his premises, where Booth
</p>
<p>lay night and day wrapped in a pair of blankets that had most
</p>
<p>likely been furnished him by Dr. Mudd. Finally, being furnished
</p>
<p>by Jones with a boat, they took their own risks and effected a
</p>
<p>crossing; but they were seen by a colored man, upon whose
</p>
<p>report General Baker got on their track and finally effected their
</p>
<p>capture.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that Booth had selected this as the route
</p>
<p>for his escape months before, and that all of his visits to this part
</p>
<p>of Maryland had been made with reference to this plan. Being at
</p>
<p>length across the Potomac, even though under such unfavorable
</p>
<p>auspices, Booth no doubt drew a free and exultant breath at
</p>
<p>having been permitted to set his foot at last on the soil of the
</p>
<p>Old Dominion. He felt that he was now amongst friends who
</p>
<p>would aid him in his progress, or help him by concealment, as
</p>
<p>the case might require ; and his friend Jones no doubt breathed
</p>
<p>with a freedom he had not known for some days at finding himself
</p>
<p>cut loose from his dangerous charge. Booth was greatly disap-
</p>
<p>pointed at the cold reception given him by the people on whom
</p>
<p>he had counted so much after crossing into Virginia. He had
</p>
<p>expected to be lionized and honored as the hero of the age ; but
</p>
<p>instead of that he received a comparatively cold reception that
</p>
<p>stung his vanity like the poison of an asp. '
</p>
<p>It is true the people showed no disposition to betray him ; but,
</p>
<p>at the same time, they manifested a disposition to enter into no
</p>
<p>compromising friendship with him, or in any way to assume any
</p>
<p>responsibility in his behalf by helping him to escape. How much
</p>
<p>of this was due to abhorrence of his crime, and how much to a
</p>
<p>dread of consequences, can only be a matter of conjecture. The

<p>fact that they were willing to let him escape, if he could, would
</p>
<p>throw the preponderance on the latter as the governing motive of

<p>crime and commenced his guilty flight ; and now he found him-
</p>
<p>self on foot, so lame as scarcely to be able to walk a step, even
</p>
<p>with the help of a crutch, and scarcely more than fifty miles
</p>
<p>from his starting point. His companion in crime, Herold, was
</p>
<p>now the only human being on whose friendship and fidelity he
</p>
<p>could certainly rely. A reward of one hundred and seventy-five
</p>
<p>thousand dollars offered for his capture, the brand of Cain upon
</p>
<p>him, his fractured bone cutting into the flesh at every movement
</p>
<p>of his limb, a constant admonition of a frowning Providence,
</p>
<p>it is no wonder that the diurnal entries in his book begin to bear
</p>
<p>evidence of a remorse that can never be appeased. We can .but
</p>
<p>pity his deplorable condition, for he was a fellow-man ; but
</p>
<p>then he was at the same time a monster in crime, directed by
</p>
<p>hatred of a fellow-man without just cause, and of wickedness that
</p>
<p>had brought upon him the blood of one of the greatest and best
</p>
<p>of men, not only of his own age and country, but of all the ages of
</p>
<p>the world. When we contemplate his crime, our sympathies refuse
</p>
<p>to go with him, and our sense of justice finds a grateful feeling of
</p>
<p>relief in the evidence now clearly pointing to the fact that he is
</p>
<p>a doomed man.
</p>
<p>By the aid of his blind follower, Herold, he is able to maintain
</p>
<p>his concealment, and after a wretched fashion to resume his flight
</p>
<p>in an old wagon drawn by two miserable horses and driven by a
</p>
<p>negro. In this state he reaches Port Conway, on the Rappahannock,
</p>
<p>in King George County, Virginia. Here his driver refuses to take
</p>
<p>him any further. It is just at this juncture and in this dilemma
</p>
<p>that they are met by three confederate soldiers, Major Ruggles,
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Bainbridge, and Captain William Jett, the latter of
</p>
<p>Moseby's command.
</p>
<p>Herold, thinking they were recruiting for the rebel service, was
</p>
<p>quick to see in them a means of assistance in getting South, and
</p>
<p>under the protection of the stars and bars, and so revealed their
</p>
<p>identity, appealing to them for assistance. A little later, Booth,

<p>getting out of the wretched conveyance, came forward, and to assure
</p>
<p>himself of their disposition toward him, accosted them with the in-
</p>
<p>terrogatory, "I suppose you have been told who we are?" then,
</p>
<p>throwing himself back on his crutch, and straightening himself up,
</p>
<p>56 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>with pistol cocked and drawn, he said, " Yes, I am Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>the slayer of Abraham Lincoln, and I am worth just one hundred
</p>
<p>and seventy-five thousand dollars to the man that captures me."
</p>
<p>His attitude and speech was that of a man at bay, under the power
</p>
<p>of a desperate purpose never to be taken alive. These three offi-
</p>
<p>cers of the confederate army (for they were such at this time, not
</p>
<p>having been paroled), whilst mildly protesting that they did not
</p>
<p>sanction his acts as an assassin, assured him that they did not want
</p>
<p>any blood money, and promised to render him all the assistance
</p>
<p>in their power in making his escape, a promise which they faith-
</p>
<p>fully kept. Major Ruggles dismounted and placed Booth on his
</p>
<p>horse, when the whole party crossed over the Rappahannock, from
</p>
<p>Port Conway, in King George, to Port Royal, in Caroline County,
</p>
<p>Virginia, and after an ineffectual effort to find quarters for Booth
</p>
<p>in the town, they took him three miles on the road to Bowling
</p>
<p>Green, the county seat of the latter county, where they succeeded
</p>
<p>in getting a man by the name of Garrett to take him in, with the
</p>
<p>understanding that he would do all he could for his comfort and
</p>
<p>safety. Garrett took Booth and Herold in with a full knowledge
</p>
<p>of all the facts in the case, and with some manifest reluctance from
</p>
<p>a knowledge of the danger he would thus incur.
</p>
<p>Bainbridge and Herold went on to Bowling Green, whilst Ruggles
</p>
<p>and Jett remained over night in the woods near the house, Booth
</p>
<p>being hid away on the premises and cared for. On the following
</p>
<p>day Captain Jett went to Bowling Green on a visit, prompted by
</p>
<p>the tender passion, where he intended to remain a few days ; and
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Bainbridge returned to the Garrett farm, where he
</p>
<p>rejoined Major Ruggles. The two started for Port Conway, but
</p>
<p>before getting there, learned that the town was full of Yankee
</p>
<p>cavalry, when they lost no time in returning to Garrett's, and gave
</p>
<p>warning to Booth, advising him to lose no time in fleeing to a
</p>
<p>piece of woods, which they pointed out to him, and then turned
</p>
<p>to look out for their own safety. The cavalry of which they got

<p>this notice was a squad detailed from the Sixteenth New York
</p>
<p>Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Dougherty, which had been
</p>
<p>ordered to report to General L. C. Baker of the Secret Service
</p>
<p>Department, and by him placed in charge of E. J. Conger and
</p>
<p>L. B. Baker, officers belonging to his detective force.
</p>
<p>I'XRAVELLING THE PLOT. 57
</p>
<p>Arriving at Port Conway on the afternoon of the day subsequent
</p>
<p>to the crossing of the parties above referred to, and finding the wife
</p>
<p>of the ferry keeper at the ferry-house sitting and conversing with
</p>
<p>another women, Colonel Conger exhibited to them a photograph
</p>
<p>of Booth, and informed them that that was the man they wanted.
</p>
<p>It at once became apparent to him, from the manner and actions
</p>
<p>of the woman, that Booth was not far off. The ferryman, a man
</p>
<p>by the name of Rollins, was sent for, and being influenced no doubt
</p>
<p>by fear of compromising himself he became very communicative.
</p>
<p>He told them all about the party that had crossed the day before,
</p>
<p>one of whom, Captain Jett, he knew welt ; and knowing that Jett
</p>
<p>had been paying attention to a Miss Goldman, the daughter of a
</p>
<p>Bowling Green hotel keeper, he suggested that he would most
</p>
<p>probably be found there. Colonel Conger pushed on with his
</p>
<p>squad of cavalry, commanded by Captain, then Lieutenant, E. P.
</p>
<p>Dougherty, to Bowling Green, passing the Garrett farm after
</p>
<p>dark.
</p>
<p>Arriving at Goldman's Hotel, he inquired of Mrs. Goldman as
</p>
<p>to the men that were in the house. She answered him that her
</p>
<p>wounded son was in a room upstairs, and that he was all the
</p>
<p>man there was there. Colonel Conger then required her to lead
</p>
<p>the way upstairs, telling her at the same time that if his men
</p>
<p>were fired on he would burn the building and carry its inmates
</p>
<p>to Washington as prisoners. As he entered the room which she
</p>
<p>showed him, up one flight of stairs, Captain Jett jumped out of
</p>
<p>bed half-dressed, and admitted his identity. Colonel Conger then
</p>
<p>informed him that he was cognizant of his movements for the last
</p>
<p>two days, and proceeded to read to him the proclamation of the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War, telling him when he had done reading it that
</p>
<p>if he did not tell him the truth he would hang him ; but that if he
</p>
<p>truly gave him the information that he sought he would protect
</p>
<p>him. Jett was greatly excited, and told him that he had left
</p>
<p>Booth at the Garrett Farm, three miles from Port Royal. The

<p>Colonel then had Jett's horse taken from the stable, making Jett
</p>
<p>his unwilling guide to the place of Booth's concealment.
</p>
<p>Arriving at Garrett's, the cavalry was so disposed of as to
</p>
<p>prevent any one from escaping, and after having extorted, by

<p>threats, the information that Booth and Herold were concealed in
</p>
<p>the barn, it was at once surrounded. They were ordered to come
</p>
<p>out and surrender themselves, which Booth refused to do. After
</p>
<p>a considerable parley, Herold came to the door and gave himself
</p>
<p>up. He was followed by the maledictions of Booth, who accused
</p>
<p>him of cowardly unfaithfulness in thus deserting him. Booth still
</p>
<p>refusing to surrender, a wisp of hay was fired and thrown in on
</p>
<p>the hay in the barn. From this start the barn was soon lighted
</p>
<p>up with the flames of the burning hay. Booth was known to . be
</p>
<p>armed and desperate, and as the burning hay began to illuminate
</p>
<p>the barn he was seen, carbine in hand, peering through the cracks,
</p>
<p>and trying to get an aim. He had before offered to fight the
</p>
<p>crowd for a chance of his life if the Colonel would but withdraw
</p>
<p>his men one hundred yards. Being answered that they had come
</p>
<p>to capture him, not to fight, he was preparing to sell his life
</p>
<p>as dearly as possible. At this moment, Sergeant Boston Corbett,
</p>
<p>of the Sixteenth New York Cavalry, fired at Booth through a
</p>
<p>crack in the barn, upon his own responsibility, and struck him on
</p>
<p>the back part of his head, very nearly in the same part where his
</p>
<p>own ball had struck the President, only a little lower down, and
</p>
<p>passing obliquely through the base of the brain and upper part of
</p>
<p>the spinal cord ; it produced instantly almost complete paralysis
</p>
<p>of every muscle in his body below the seat of the wound, the
</p>
<p>nerves of organic life only sufficing to keep up a very difficult and
</p>
<p>imperfect respiration, and a feeble action of the heart for a few
</p>
<p>hours, when, with the coming of the morning of the 26th of April,
</p>
<p>1865, twelve days after the commission of his crime and com-
</p>
<p>mencement of his flight, the malefactor expired. He was per-
</p>
<p>fectly clear in his mind, but could not swallow, and was scarcely
</p>
<p>able to articulate so as to be understood, although he seemed
</p>
<p>anxious to talk. He requested the officer, who was waiting over
</p>
<p>him and trying to minister to him, to tell his mother that he died
</p>
<p>for his country. Thus was avenged, not the loyal North alone,

<p>but the cause of justice, the cause of freedom, the cause of
</p>
<p>humanity. Amongst the articles found on his person the most
</p>
<p>important as bearing on the conspiracy in which he was engaged
</p>
<p>was a bill of exchange, as follows :

<p>UNRAVELLING THE PLOT. 59

<p>MONTREAL, 27th October, 1864.
</p>
<p>Sixty days after sight of this first exchange (second and third of same tenor and
</p>
<p>date unpaid) pay to the order of J. Wilkes Booth sixty-one pounds, twelve shillings,
</p>
<p>and ten pence sterling. Value received and charge to account of this office.

<p>The body was brought to Washington and identified fully. It
</p>
<p>was buried, for the time secretly, under the floor of the old
</p>
<p>Capitol Prison, but afterwards was given up to his friends.
</p>
<p>Major Ruggles, in his account of his connection with Booth in his
</p>
<p>flight, gives it as his opinion that he was not shot, as claimed, by
</p>
<p>Sergeant Corbett, but that seeing escape hopeless, and knowing
</p>
<p>death to be his fate, he took his own life, holding his pistol to the
</p>
<p>back of his head ; and in support of this opinion refers to the fact
</p>
<p>that one chamber of his revolver was found to be empty. He also
</p>
<p>advances the opinion that had the war still been going on, and
</p>
<p>Booth had made his escape into the confederate lines, the rebel
</p>
<p>government would have arrested him and delivered him up to the
</p>
<p>United States authorities. In this opinion he takes a charitable
</p>
<p>view of the virtue and moral integrity of the Richmond govern-
</p>
<p>ment which I shall hereafter show is not warranted by the facts
</p>
<p>and evidence in the case. In this opinion he is also giving that

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Arrest of Spangler, O'Laughlin, Atzerodt, Mudd, and Arnold.
</p>
<p>NOT only was the government bending every energy to overtake
</p>
<p>and capture Booth and Herold, but also to find out who were their
</p>
<p>co-conspirators. It undertook a systematic investigation of Booth's
</p>
<p>haunts, associations, habits, and employment during the recent past.
</p>
<p>Hotel registers were overhauled, liverymen interviewed, and each
</p>
<p>clue followed up, so that in a short time enough was known to
</p>
<p>lead to the arrest of Edward Spangler, Michael O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>George A. Atzerodt, Samuel Arnold, and Dr. Samuel A. Mudd,
</p>
<p>in addition to those heretofore spoken of as having been arrested.
</p>
<p>By this time the evidence in possession of the government made it
</p>
<p>clear that what had occurred was but a partial accomplishment
</p>
<p>of a great conspiracy, which had its origin with the agents of the
</p>
<p>rebel government in Canada; and that its execution had been
</p>
<p>entrusted to John Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt, as leaders,
</p>
<p>and to such assistants as they should select and employ.
</p>
<p>It was soon discovered that Booth's intimate associates, with
</p>
<p>whom he held private confidential intercourse, were John H.
</p>
<p>Surratt, and his mother, Mary E. Surratt, Lewis Payne, George
</p>
<p>A. Atzerodt, Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, David E. Herold, Samuel
</p>
<p>Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlin ; and that the house of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt was the headquarters of the conspirators in Washington.
</p>
<p>Arnold and O'Laughlin were intimate personal friends and asso-
</p>
<p>ciates of Booth at his home in Baltimore. Booth, Payne, and
</p>
<p>Atzerodt were frequent callers at the house of Mrs. Surratt, where
</p>
<p>they were always made welcome ; their business was always of a
</p>
<p>private, confidential nature, and was with John Surratt when he

</p>
<p>was at home, but in his absence was with Mrs. Surratt herself.
</p>
<p>Booth had every privilege granted to him in that house, his
</p>
<p>requests for a private conference being always responded to by
</p>
<p>John or his mother. To Booth it seemed to be a matter of
</p>
<p>indifference which of the two it was. In tracing his movements
</p>
<p>the last few months preceeding the assassination, it soon became
</p>
<p>evident that he was acting under the impulse of a purpose that
</p>
<p>had entire possession of his mind. Having undertaken to secure
</p>
<p>the accomplishment of the assassinations planned by Davis and
</p>
<p>his Canada Cabinet, in the latter part of October, 1864, he was
</p>
<p>constantly employed in making his preparations for the fulfillment
</p>
<p>of his contract, and gave no time or thought, apparently, to any-
</p>
<p>thing else. He entirely abandoned his profession, that of an
</p>
<p>actor, and lost all interest in the stage. He no longer consorted
</p>
<p>with those of his profession to any extent, except as it might be
</p>
<p>in preparation for the work to which he had devoted his life,
</p>
<p>and accepted, instead, the fellowship of such low-browed scoun-
</p>
<p>drels as Payne and Atzerodt as better suited to his purpose.
</p>
<p>They became mere tools in his hands, sympathizing with him
</p>
<p>fully in his intense disloyalty, but being actuated at the same
</p>
<p>time by a mercenary motive, the evidence justifying the con-
</p>
<p>clusion that they had a promise of a large pecuniary reward.
</p>
<p>He spent a great deal of time with these men, studying their
</p>
<p>characters, and schooling them in the parts they were to act.
</p>
<p>They were all known to the liverymen of the city, of whom
</p>
<p>they very frequently obtained horses to ride about the suburbs
</p>
<p>and study the roads, that they might be thoroughly familiar with
</p>
<p>the locality when the time should come for them to make their
</p>
<p>escape. They were all known, also, to go constantly armed with
</p>
<p>revolvers and bowie-knives by those who had opportunities of see-
</p>
<p>ing them together in their private intercourse. They boarded at
</p>
<p>different hotels, and frequently changed their boarding-places, but
</p>
<p>were frequent visitors of each other at whatever places they might

</p>
<p>be stopping, and their intercourse was always observed to be that
</p>
<p>of privacy ; and so it became a just cause for suspicion to have
</p>
<p>been an intimate companion of Booth, and finally led to the arrest
</p>
<p>of them all.
</p>
<p>62 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>With regard to the relations existing between Booth and John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt, and his mother, Mary E. Surratt, the evidence showed
</p>
<p>that they would always retire to an upstairs room whenever a
</p>
<p>lengthy conference was desired ; but that they frequently held
</p>
<p>short private conferences in the parlor, when it could be done
</p>
<p>without danger of interruption. Booth's right to thus come into
</p>
<p>the house and demand these private interviews was never ques-
</p>
<p>tioned, but granted with the alacrity due to a common purpose
</p>
<p>that required it.
</p>
<p>Foundation for the Arrest of Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>The agents of the government, in pursuing their investiga-
</p>
<p>tions, obtained evidence that Mrs. Surratt's house had been the
</p>
<p>meeting-place or headquarters of the conspirators, and that she
</p>
<p>was in private, confidential intercourse with Booth. One of the
</p>
<p>principal witnesses against her was Louis J. Wiechmann, who had
</p>
<p>been for several months a boarder in her house, and whose friendly
</p>
<p>relations with the family were due to the fact that he had been a
</p>
<p>fellow-student with John H. Surratt at St. Charles College, in
</p>
<p>Maryland, and to the further fact that they were co-religionists.
</p>
<p>Wiechmann had been, during all this time that he had been a
</p>
<p>boarder at Mrs. Surratt's, employed as a clerk in the office of
</p>
<p>General Hoffman, Commissary General of Prisoners ; and from
</p>
<p>him the facts above alleged were learned. Wiechmann also stated
</p>
<p>that Mrs. Surratt sent him to Booth with a message that she
</p>
<p>wanted to see him on private business, and that Booth replied
</p>
<p>that he would come that evening or as soon as he could, and that
</p>
<p>he did come that evening.
</p>
<p>On the Tuesday previous to the assassination, Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>requested Wiechmann to drive her down to Surrattsville, saying
</p>
<p>that she wanted to see a Mr. Nothey who owed her some money.
</p>
<p>Upon his consenting to do so, she sent him to the National Hotel
</p>
<p>to see Booth, and request the use of his horse and buggy for
</p>
<p>the occasion. Booth said he had sold his horse and buggy, but

</p>
<p>handed to Wiechmann ten dollars with which to procure one.
</p>
<p>Wiechmann got a conveyance and drove Mrs. Surratt to Surratts-
</p>
<p>ville and back. As they were on their way down, they met
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. 63
</p>
<p>Lloyd, to whom Mrs. Surratt had rented her farm and tavern at
</p>
<p>Surrattsville. Mrs. Surratt requested Wiechmann to stop ; and
</p>
<p>Lloyd, stopping at the same time, got out of his buggy and came
</p>
<p>close to Mrs. Surratt, who conversed with him in so low a tone
</p>
<p>that Wiechmann did not hear what was said, but Lloyd testified
</p>
<p>before the Commission that she told him to "have those shoot-
</p>
<p>ing-irons where they would be convenient, as they would be
</p>
<p>wanted before long." The "shooting-irons" referred to were two
</p>
<p>carbines, which, with ammunition, a monkey-wrench, and a piece
</p>
<p>of rope, had been left with Lloyd by John H. Surratt, Herold, and
</p>
<p>Atzerodt about three weeks before, with the request that he should
</p>
<p>keep them hid, Surratt at the same time showing him a safe
</p>
<p>place to secrete them. On the Friday of the assassination, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt requested Wiechmann to drive her down to Surrattsville,
</p>
<p>alleging that she was going to see Mr. Nothey again on the same
</p>
<p>business as before. She gave Wiechmann money to procure a con-
</p>
<p>veyance and he drove her down. Booth was with her in the parlor
</p>
<p>when he returned with the conveyance, and when Mrs. Surratt was
</p>
<p>about getting into the buggy, she requested Wiechmann to wait until
</p>
<p>she went and got Mr. Booth's things. She went back into the
</p>
<p>parlor and returned with a field-glass, which she delivered to Lloyd.
</p>
<p>They reached Surrattsville about four o'clock. Mrs. Surratt then
</p>
<p>had Wiechmann sit down and write a note to Mr. Nothey at her
</p>
<p>dictation, which she sent to him by a Mr. Bennett Gwin. Lloyd
</p>
<p>had gone to Marlboro to court, and Mrs. Surratt awaited his return
</p>
<p>which was not until about half-past six oclock. When Lloyd
</p>
<p>returned, he drove around into the back yard to unload some
</p>
<p>fish and oysters which he had purchased, and Mrs. Surratt, who
</p>
<p>had been waiting and watching for his return, seized this oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to see him privately, when she told him, as Lloyd testified
</p>
<p>before the Commission, to have the carbines ready, as they would
</p>
<p>be called for that night, and also two bottles of whiskey. Then
</p>
<p>going with him into the house, she gave him the field-glass.

</p>
<p>She was now ready to return, and expressed anxiety to Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann to reach home before nine o'clock, saying that she had an
</p>
<p>engagement for that hour. She reached her home just before nine,
</p>
<p>and a few moments later Wiechmann, from his place at the table
</p>
<p>64 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>in the dining-room below, heard the door-bell ring, and some
</p>
<p>one enter the parlor. The interview was very short just long
</p>
<p>enough for Mrs. Surratt to say that all was right when
</p>
<p>Wiechmann heard retreating footsteps, but did not know who
</p>
<p>the visitor was. In view, however, of all the foregoing, we can-
</p>
<p>not resist the conclusion that Booth was the person, and that
</p>
<p>this was their last interview. Mrs. Surratt was able to produce
</p>
<p>the letter of Mr. Calvert which she claimed required her to go to
</p>
<p>Surrattsville that day to see Mr. Nothey, but she had no appoint-
</p>
<p>ment to meet him there, did not see him, and could just as well
</p>
<p>have written to him from her home in Washington. This excuse
</p>
<p>for her visit was a mere fabrication. Her real business was with
</p>
<p>Lloyd, and she was not ready to return until after she had an
</p>
<p>interview with him, and delivered her message from Booth, and
</p>
<p>the field-glass which he had given her. It is evident that her
</p>
<p>show of private business was gotten up as a cover to her real
</p>
<p>errand.
</p>
<p>Again, Payne had visited the Surratt house on several occasions.
</p>
<p>The first time he came he called for John H. Surratt, and on being
</p>
<p>told by Wiechmann that John was not at home, he requested to
</p>
<p>see Mrs. Surratt. He passed this time under the alias of Wood,
</p>
<p>and was received by Mrs. Surratt, and kept over night, when he
</p>
<p>departed for Baltimore. About three weeks later, say about the
</p>
<p>2Oth of March (as his first visit was about the 1st of March), he
</p>
<p>made his second visit, passing under the name of Payne, and
</p>
<p>remained three days. It was during this visit that the episode
</p>
<p>already referred to as having in all probability been an attempt to
</p>
<p>murder the President on his visit to the Soldier's Home, occurred,
</p>
<p>and from which Surratt, Booth, and Payne returned under such
</p>
<p>excitement and evident disappointment.
</p>
<p>To such members of the family as had not been initiated into the
</p>
<p>plot, this man of many aliases Wood, Payne, and Powell
</p>
<p>passed as a Baptist preacher. He said that he had taken the oath

<p>whilst in Baltimore, and intended henceforth to be a good, loyal
</p>
<p>man. When this man came to the house of Mrs. Surratt on the
</p>
<p>night of the i/th of April, as heretofore related, and was placed

<p>under arrest, Mrs. Surratt, who had also upon a knowledge of the

</p>
<p>facts just recited been arrested a few minutes before, when she was
</p>
<p>called into the hall and confronted with Payne, having heard his
</p>
<p>story as to why he had come and what he had come for, holding
</p>
<p>up her hands exclaimed, " Before God, I do not know this man,
</p>
<p>and never saw him before." He had been a guest at her table
</p>
<p>for three days only a few days previous to this, and was a man of
</p>
<p>such a marked personality that having seen him once it would
</p>
<p>have been impossible to have failed to recognize him on seeing
</p>
<p>him again, even though he might have been partially disguised.
</p>
<p>With a woman's intuitive perception, she saw the compromising
</p>
<p>effect that his visit at that time of night, and under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances, was calculated to have on her own case, and so felt the
</p>
<p>necessity of this solemn disavowal of any knowledge of him.
</p>
<p>Before the government felt justified in arresting this woman, only,
</p>
<p>indeed, two or three hours after the assassination, it being known
</p>
<p>that Booth was the assassin, and that he and John H. Surratt:
</p>
<p>were intimate friends, the detectives went to the house of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt to see whom they could find there. When they rang the
</p>
<p>bell Wiechmann, who occupied an upstairs room, opened the
</p>
<p>window and inquired what they wanted. Upon their demanding
</p>
<p>admittance, stating that they had been sent to that house to see
</p>
<p>whom they could find in it, Wiechmann went and rapped at Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt's door, informing her who it was that demanded admit-
</p>
<p>tance, and asking her if he should let them in, when she replied,
</p>
<p>" Yes, let them in ; I have been expecting them." Now, why
</p>
<p>should Mrs. Surratt at that hour, about three o'clock on the
</p>
<p>morning of the I5th, and only three or four hours after the
</p>
<p>assassination, have been expecting a visit from the detectives? A
</p>
<p>guilty conscience is its own accuser.
</p>
<p>As Wiechmann and Lloyd were the principal witnesses against
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt, and their evidence so conclusively established her
</p>
<p>guilt, her counsel made an effort to discredit their testimony, but
</p>
<p>utterly failed to do so-. Wiechmann was a young man who estab-

</p>
<p>lished a good character for veracity and general moral deport-
</p>
<p>ment by witnesses who had been intimately associated with him
</p>
<p>for months in General Hoffman's department. His manner was
</p>
<p>that of a man who was deeply affected by the fact that he found
</p>
<p>66 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>himself in a situation in which his duty to his God and his country
</p>
<p>required him to state facts that had been thrust upon him, and
</p>
<p>that were now found to be so damaging to those with whom he
</p>
<p>had, been associating and whom he had regarded as friends. The
</p>
<p>attempt made by counsel for the defense in their arguments to
</p>
<p>break the force of his testimony by throwing out the unfounded
</p>
<p>insinuation that he probably knew of the existence of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, was done for the purpose of engendering a doubt of the
</p>
<p>simple truth of his utterances which were corroborated by other
</p>
<p>testimony than his own, and of which he could have had no
</p>
<p>previous knowledge. Wiechmann's testimony, taking into con-
</p>
<p>sideration the lies told to him and the deceptions practiced upon
</p>
<p>him for nearly four months, is in itself absolute proof of his.
</p>
<p>integrity and of his innocence. In the words of Judge Bingham
</p>
<p>in all that dread issue, " There was not a breath of suspicion
</p>
<p>found against his character, nor was a single fact to which he testified
</p>
<p>contradicted. The defense tried to kill him off with lies and
</p>
<p>insinuations, but they could not and did not do it." Wiechmann
</p>
<p>admitted that he had been puzzled to account for some of these
</p>
<p>occurrences. He could not understand why such persons as
</p>
<p>Payne and Atzerodt should be received and enjoy the privileges
</p>
<p>accorded to them by Mrs. Surratt and her son ; but particularly
</p>
<p>he had had his suspicions aroused by the conduct of Surratt,
</p>
<p>Payne, and Booth upon their return from their ride as heretofore
</p>
<p>recited. He had related this occurrence to Captain Gleason, arc
</p>
<p>officer with whom he was associated in his daily work. He
</p>
<p>referred to a report or rumor, which had found its way into the
</p>
<p>papers, of a plot to capture the President, and asked the Captain
</p>
<p>if he thought it could be possible that this could have been the
</p>
<p>object of their expedition. Wiechmann's character and actions
</p>
<p>in the matter could not be discredited by insinuations that had no
</p>
<p>evidence to rest on for their support.
</p>
<p>Lloyd had rented Mrs. Surratt's farm and tavern at Surrattsville,.

</p>
<p>and so was her tenant. He was a man of intemperate habits, and
</p>
<p>there was, I think, taking all things into consideration, strong
</p>
<p>reason to conclude that he had been entrusted with the secret of
</p>
<p>the plot ; but of this there was no direct proof, and much less of
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. 67
</p>
<p>his having been any further a party to the conspiracy. Even admit-
</p>
<p>ting that he had this guilty knowledge, it does not disqualify him
</p>
<p>for telling the truth as to what occurred at the private interviews
</p>
<p>referred to between himself and Mrs. Surratt, and that these
</p>
<p>private interviews did take place under the circumstances already
</p>
<p>related we have the positive testimony of Wiechmann. Lloyd's
</p>
<p>testimony was drawn out of him by questions suggested by what
</p>
<p>Wiechmann had previously stated before the Commission. The
</p>
<p>defense failed entirely to prove that he was a man not to be
</p>
<p>believed upon his oath.
</p>
<p>They endeavored to break the force of the testimony of Major
</p>
<p>Smith in regard to Mrs. Surratt solemnly disclaiming any knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of Payne by claiming that her eyesight was very defective,
</p>
<p>but failed to establish any evidence of infirmity of sight beyond
</p>
<p>what was common to a person of her age of forty-five years.
</p>
<p>The evidence of Major Smith was that the hall was well lighted
</p>
<p>when she was confronted with Payne, and her haste to disavow
</p>
<p>any knowledge of him with such unnecessary solemnity was itself
</p>
<p>evidence of guilt. Her eminent volunteer counsel, Hon. Reverdy
</p>
<p>Johnson, at that time a United States senator from Maryland, did
</p>
<p>not attempt to assail the testimony against her or to make any
</p>
<p>reference whatever to her case ; but confined himself to an
</p>
<p>argument against the constitutionality of her trial by a military
</p>
<p>commission and against the jurisdiction of the court. In view of
</p>
<p>all the facts above narrated, all of which were proven by the
</p>
<p>witnesses brought before the Commission by the government, the
</p>
<p>author thinks it would be impossible for any candid mind to
</p>
<p>escape from the conclusion that Mn.. Surratt was fully informed
</p>
<p>of the purposes of Booth and her son, and gave to them her
</p>
<p>hearty approval and earnest co-operation. We have now pre-
</p>
<p>sented in narrative form the evidence on which Mrs. Surratt was
</p>

<p>and soul into the schemes of Booth and her son, hoping thereby
</p>
<p>to serve the cause of the confederacy.
</p>
<p>Arrest of Atzerodt.
</p>
<p>George A. Atzerodt had undertaken for his part the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of Vice-President Johnson. He was found to have been a
</p>
<p>frequent visitor at the Surratt house, and a boon companion of
</p>
<p>Payne, Surratt, and Booth. It was found that he had taken a
</p>
<p>room at the Kirkwood House where the Vice-President was stop-
</p>
<p>ping at the time. He had been assigned to room number 126,
</p>
<p>on the next floor above that on which was the room occupied by
</p>
<p>the Vice-President. He had been stopping at the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>House from the 2/th of March until the I2th of April, and took
</p>
<p>this room at the Kirkwood House on the morning of the I4th of
</p>
<p>April, paying in advance for one day. On the I2th of April he
</p>
<p>visited this house, and meeting Col. W. R. Nevins in the passage
</p>
<p>leading to the dining-room, he asked him if he knew where Vice-
</p>
<p>President Johnson was. Nevins showed him the Vice-President's
</p>
<p>room, but remarked, " He is now at dinner," pointing him out to
</p>
<p>Atzerodt as he sat at the table. Atzerodt did not enter the
</p>
<p>dining-room, but simply looked in at the Vice-President. It was
</p>
<p>ascertained that Atzerodt had not occupied his room on the night
</p>
<p>of the I4th, and when the detectives who were on his track came
</p>
<p>to the Kirkwood House on the afternoon of the I5th, it was
</p>
<p>found locked, and the door had to be forced. Mr. Lee, the
</p>
<p>officer in pursuit of him, found in his room, upon gaining admis-
</p>
<p>sion, a black coat hanging against the wall; underneath the
</p>
<p>pillow or bolster a revolver loaded and capped, and between the
</p>
<p>sheets and mattress a large bowie-knife. In the pockets of the
</p>
<p>coat were found a handkerchief marked " Mary R. Booth," another
</p>
<p>marked " F. M.," or " F. A. Nelson," and another marked " H," in
</p>
<p>one corner ; also a bank-book of J. Wilkes Booth, showing a credit
</p>
<p>of four hundred and fifty-five dollars with the Ontario Bank of
</p>
<p>Montreal, and a map of Virginia. On the corner of the bank-

<p>Montreal, Canada, 1864, October 27; by deposit Cr. $455."
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. 69
</p>
<p>This coat evidently belonged to Booth, and its being thus found
</p>
<p>in Atzerodt's room showed that Booth had visited him there dur-
</p>
<p>ing the day ; and that he had spent some time with him schooling
</p>
<p>him in his part was shown by the fact that he had taken off his
</p>
<p>light overcoat and hung it up against the wall, and had evidently
</p>
<p>become so much absorbed in mind with the purpose of his visit
</p>
<p>that he forgot to take his coat when he left. The revolver loaded
</p>
<p>and capped, and the huge bowie-knife hidden in the bed, serve to
</p>
<p>explain the nature of the interview between Booth and Atzerodt,
</p>
<p>and the purpose of death to the Vice-President on the part of the
</p>
<p>former, and in which purpose at that time Atzerodt no doubt
</p>
<p>fully concurred. During the stay of Atzerodt at the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>House he was frequently called on by Booth, and they were at
</p>
<p>pains always to hold their interviews in private.
</p>
<p>Atzerodt's whereabouts from the I2th to the I4th of April are
</p>
<p>not accounted for. On the I4th, after having taken his room "at
</p>
<p>the Kirkwood, we next find him at a livery-stable on Eighth and
</p>
<p>E streets, where he procured a bay mare, paying five dollars for
</p>
<p>her hire for the afternoon. He took her to Naylor's stable and
</p>
<p>had her put up. Here he was accompanied by Herold. It was
</p>
<p>about one o'clock P.M. when he had his mare put up. He left and
</p>
<p>did not return until about seven P.M. On his return he ordered his
</p>
<p>mare to be saddled, and requested that she should be left stand-
</p>
<p>ing with the saddle and bridle on until ten o'clock, when he would
</p>
<p>call for her. He returned at ten, got his mare, and left. He
</p>
<p>returned the mare to the stable on Eighth and E streets shortly
</p>
<p>after the assassination of the President, at about eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>After returning the mare, he boarded a navy-yard car at Sixth
</p>
<p>Street, and rode down as far as the navy-yard. Finding a man
</p>
<p>by the name of Briscoe on the car, with whom he was acquainted,
</p>
<p>he asked him to let him sleep with him in his store. Being refused,
</p>
<p>he urged his request, and seemed excited. Briscoe asked him if
</p>
<p>he had heard the news. He replied that he had.

</p>
<p>Not getting permission to lodge with Briscoe, he said he would
</p>
<p>return to the Pennsylvania House, which he did, arriving there
</p>
<p>on horseback about twelve M. or one o'clock A.M. He asked
</p>
<p>the colored boy in waiting at the house to hold his horse whilst
</p>
<p>70 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>he went into the bar. He then mounted his horse and left, return-
</p>
<p>ing again at about two o'clock on foot, in company with another
</p>
<p>man. They paid for their lodging and retired. Atzerodt, on being
</p>
<p>requested by the clerk to register before retiring to his room, hesi-
</p>
<p>tated, and did it with manifest reluctance. These parties arose
</p>
<p>very early on the morning of the i^th, and left. At about
</p>
<p>eight o'clock on the morning of the I5th, we find Atzerodt in
</p>
<p>Georgetown trying to sell his watch to a man with whom he was
</p>
<p>somewhat acquainted ; but not being able to do so, he pawned
</p>
<p>his pistol for ten dollars, saying he was going to the country and
</p>
<p>would come, or send, and redeem it the next week. He was
</p>
<p>followed and arrested in Montgomery County, Maryland, on the
</p>
<p>2Oth of April.
</p>
<p>He ate his dinner on the i6th at the house of Mr Hezekiah
</p>
<p>Metz. There were two or three other persons at the table with
</p>
<p>him, and all were anxious to hear the news from Washington.
</p>
<p>He was asked whether it was true, as had been reported in that
</p>
<p>neighborhood, that General Grant had been killed. Atzerodt,
</p>
<p>according to the testimony of Metz, replied that " if the man who
</p>
<p>was to follow him had done so it was likely to be true." There was
</p>
<p>some conflict of statement, however, between Metz and the other
</p>
<p>two parties who were at the table, and who were used as witnesses
</p>
<p>for the defense. These thought he said if it were so, it was likely
</p>
<p>to have been done by some one who got on the train with him.
</p>
<p>There are good reasons, however, for concluding that Metz gave
</p>
<p>his real answer.
</p>
<p>Atzerodt was known in that neighborhood as Andrew Atwood.
</p>
<p>From Metz's he went to the house of his cousin, Hartman
</p>
<p>Richter, near the little village of Germantown, and remained
</p>
<p>there until he was arrested by Sergeant L. W. Grimmell on the night
</p>
<p>of the 2Oth. Richter denied that there was anybody in his house
</p>
<p>when inquired of by the Sergeant. When told by the Sergeant
</p>
<p>that he would have to search the house, he admitted that his cousin

</p>
<p>was upstairs in bed. His wife then spoke up, saying, "there were
</p>
<p>three men there for that matter." Atzerodt was brought to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington and held as a prisoner for trial, as a party to the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>There is no doubt from the evidence presented, that he was not
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. Jl
</p>
<p>only a party to the conspiracy, but also that Booth had arranged
</p>
<p>with him and relied on him to assassinate the Vice-President. For
</p>
<p>this purpose he had removed him from the Pennsylvania to the
</p>
<p>Kirkwooci House, where the Vice-President had rooms, and was
</p>
<p>boarding. This change had been made on the morning of the
</p>
<p>1 4th, and Booth had been there during the day to see that all
</p>
<p>things were properly arranged. Atzerodt's revolver was found
</p>
<p>hidden away in his bed, loaded, capped, and ready for use. His
</p>
<p>bowie-knife also was found secreted in his bed ; and yet 'there
</p>
<p>is no evidence that he was in his room, or even in the house dur-
</p>
<p>ing the evening or night. In his defense his counsel set up the
</p>
<p>plea, and proved it, that he was incapable of committing such a
</p>
<p>crime, being constitutionally a coward. He was a low-browed,
</p>
<p>vulgar vagabond, fond of whiskey, tobacco, and vicious company ;
</p>
<p>a cowardly braggart, covering up his cowardice by a great pre-
</p>
<p>tense of bravery when the battle was not on ; low enough in moral
</p>
<p>tone to do any wicked thing, but without physical courage to
</p>
<p>face the danger connected with what he had engaged to do.
</p>
<p>Booth had mistaken his man ; but being a member of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, he was equally guilty with Booth.
</p>
<p>Arrest of Spangler.
</p>
<p>On the strength of the facts incidentally presented in the forego-
</p>
<p>ing narrative, Edward Spangler was taken into military custody, and
</p>
<p>held as a prisoner for trial. The capture of Herold has already
</p>
<p>been given. All of these prisoners were held in military custody,
</p>
<p>and under such precautions as would have rendered any attempt
</p>
<p>at rescue or escape the height of folly.
</p>
<p>In Booth's trunk a letter was found from Samuel Arnold to
</p>
<p>Booth, dated at Hookstown, Md., March 2/th, 1865. This letter
</p>
<p>was signed simply " Sam," but was proved to be in Arnold's hand-
</p>
<p>writing, and led not only to his own arrest, but also to that of his
</p>
<p>friend and fellow conspirator, Michael O'Laughlin. Arnold had
</p>
<p>evidently fallen into a hesitating frame of mind. I feel that I can-

<p>not do better than to give this letter entire. It is as follows :
</p>
<p>72 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>HOOKSTOWN, BALTIMORE Co., March 27, 1865.
</p>
<p>DEAR JOHN : Was business so important that you could not remain in Baltimore
</p>
<p>until I saw you? I came in as soon as I could, but found you had gone to Washington.
</p>
<p>I called also on Mike, but learned from his mother that he had gone out with you and
</p>
<p>had not returned. I concluded, therefore, that he had gone with you. How inconsid-
</p>
<p>erate you have been ! When I left you, you stated you would not meet me in a month
</p>
<p>or so. Therefore, I made application for employment, an answer to which I shall receive
</p>
<p>during the week. I told my parents I had ceased with you. Can I, then, under exist-
</p>
<p>ing circumstances, come as you request? You know full well that the government
</p>
<p>suspicions something is going on there; therefore the undertaking is becoming more
</p>
<p>complicated. Why not, for the present, desist, for various reasons which, if you look
</p>
<p>into, you can readily -see, without my making any mention thereof. You, nor any one,
</p>
<p>can censure me for my present course. You have been its cause, for how can I come
</p>
<p>now after telling them I had left you ? Suspicion rests upon me now from my whole
</p>
<p>family and even parties -in the country. I will be compelled to leave home any how,
</p>
<p>and how soon I care not. None, no, not one, were more in favor of the enterprise than
</p>
<p>myself, and to-day would be there had you not done as you have : by this I mean, man-
</p>
<p>ner of proceeding. I am, as you well know, in need. I am, as you may say, in rags;
</p>
<p>whereas to-day I ought to be well clothed. I do not feel right stalking about with,
</p>
<p>means, and more from appearances a beggar. I feel my dependence : but even all this
</p>
<p>would be and was forgotten, for I was one with you. Time more propitious will arrive
</p>
<p>yet. Do not act rashly or in haste. I prefer your first query : go and see how it will
</p>
<p>be taken at R d, and e'er long I shall be better prepared to again be with you. I
</p>
<p>dislike writing, would sooner verbally make known my views, yet your non- writing
</p>
<p>causes me thus to proceed. Do not in anger peruse this. Weigh all I have said, and,
</p>
<p>as a rational man and a friend, you cannot censure or upbraid my conduct. I sincerely
</p>
<p>trust this, or aught else that shall or may occur, will never be an obstacle to obliterate
</p>
<p>our former friendship and attachment. Write me to Baltimore, as I expect to be in
</p>
<p>about Wednesday or Thursday, or, if you can possibly come on, I will Tuesday meet
</p>
<p>you in Baltimore at B . Ever I subscribe myself,
</p>
<p>Your friend,
</p>
<p>SAM.

<p>Arnold got employment at Fortress Monroe, and was there at the

<p>time of the assassination ; but the finding of the above letter in
</p>
<p>Booth's trunk, as also other evidence constantly turning up in the
</p>
<p>course of the investigations being made, identifying him with the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, led to his arrest on the i/th of April at Fortress Monroe.
</p>
<p>Arnold, when arrested, made a partial confession, relating the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of a meeting of some of the conspirators held at the
</p>
<p>Lichau House in Washington about three weeks previous to his
</p>
<p>going to Fortress Monroe.
</p>
<p>This meeting must have occurred within two or three days after
</p>
<p>the writing of the above letter, immediately before Surratt's visit
</p>
<p>to Richmond, and was attended by Booth, Surratt, O'Laughlin,

<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. 73
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, Arnold, a man with the alias of Moseby, and another
</p>
<p>whose name he could not recollect. He denied that he had ever
</p>
<p>corresponded with Booth, but on being informed of the letter
</p>
<p>found in Booth's trunk he admitted that he wrote it. He also
</p>
<p>stated that Booth had letters of introduction to Dr. Mudd and
</p>
<p>Dr. Queen, but said he did not know from whom Booth got
</p>
<p>them. He claimed that an angry discussion took place at the
</p>
<p>meeting referred to. He said he told Booth then that if the
</p>
<p>thing did not take place that week he would withdraw. Booth
</p>
<p>got angry at that, and said he ought to be shot for talking in
</p>
<p>that way. He said that he replied to Booth that two could
</p>
<p>play at that game ; and that he withdrew from the conspiracy at
</p>
<p>that time, and occupied his position at Fortress Monroe on the
</p>
<p>ist of April. It is evident, I think, that as he began to contem-
</p>
<p>plate the hazards of the enterprise, its dangers began to be more
</p>
<p>and more apparent to him. His heart failed him, and he was
</p>
<p>anxious for an excuse to withdraw from it, but had not the courage
</p>
<p>to peremptorily do so. This is the interpretation I put upon the
</p>
<p>above letter of the altercation between him and Booth, and of his
</p>
<p>going to Fortress Monroe.
</p>
<p>There is also apparent in the letter a shade of disappointment
</p>
<p>and dissatisfaction in regard to pecuniary matters, implying that
</p>
<p>promised reward had been withheld by Booth. Early in Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, whilst at a grain threshing, Arnold received a letter contain-
</p>
<p>ing a fifty-dollar bill. Reading the letter and showing it with the
</p>
<p>money to a companion, he remarked that " he was flush." He
</p>
<p>handed the letter to his friend to read, but he, after trying to read
</p>
<p>a few lines, and finding that he could not understand it on account
</p>
<p>of its ambiguity, handed it back to Arnold, asking him what it
</p>
<p>meant. Arnold replied that something big would be seen in the
</p>
<p>papers one of these days. This was no doubt a retainer's fee, or
</p>
<p>in other words, an advance payment from Booth. The rather
</p>
<p>complaining tone of Arnold's letter, hinting at pecuniary embar-
</p>

</p>
<p>rassment, would seem to indicate that Booth's promises of pecu-
</p>
<p>niary reward had been large, whilst his fulfillment had been far
</p>
<p>from satisfactory.
</p>
<p>This, amongst other considerations to be named, had evidently
</p>
<p>74 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>cooled Arnold's ardor in the prosecution of the plot, and was
</p>
<p>the cause of his disposition to withdraw from it.
</p>
<p>The probabilities are that his parents and friends suspecting that
</p>
<p>his intimacy with Booth foreboded evil, and probably suspecting
</p>
<p>something of his purpose, had so earnestly remonstrated with him as
</p>
<p>to cause him to stagger or falter in his purpose, and made him
</p>
<p>anxious for an excuse for breaking with Booth. He perhaps
</p>
<p>began to regard Booth's plan as quixotic and impracticable, full
</p>
<p>of hazard, and not likely to succeed. In fact, he stated that he
</p>
<p>so told Booth at this meeting. He was evidently restive, and
</p>
<p>thought it had been put off too long to effect the end contem-
</p>
<p>plated. It does not appear to have been from any awakening of
</p>
<p>his moral nature that he faltered, neither from cowardice that he
</p>
<p>weakened ; and so he failed to purge himself of complicity in
</p>
<p>Booth's guilt. But there was sufficient evidence of his desire to
</p>
<p>withdraw from any part in the execution of Booth's present pur-
</p>
<p>poses to extenuate his guilt in a measure, at least, in the judgment
</p>
<p>of the Commission.
</p>
<p>Arrest of O' Laugklii}.
</p>
<p>Arnold's letter to Booth on the 2/th of March, which was
</p>
<p>found in Booth's trunk, together with evidence gathered up on
</p>
<p>every hand as the investigation proceeded, led to the arrest of
</p>
<p>Michael O'Laughlin at the house of his brother-in-law, in Balti-
</p>
<p>more, on Monday, the i/th of April, the same day on which
</p>
<p>Arnold was arrested. When arrested he seemed to understand
</p>
<p>what it was for, not asking any questions about it. He had gone
</p>
<p>to Washington on the I3th and remained until Saturday, the I5th.
</p>
<p>On returning to Baltimore on Saturday night, he was met at the
</p>
<p>depot by his brother-in-law, who told him that he had been in-
</p>
<p>quired for by detectives that evening. Being advised by the friend
</p>
<p>who had accompanied him to Washington and back to remain at his
</p>
<p>home, he said he would not be arrested at home, as it would kill
</p>
<p>his mother. Why was he expecting to be arrested ? A man inno-
</p>
<p>cent of crime never fears or expects arrest. He went to the house

</p>
<p>of his brother-in-law and quietly awaited the issue. He even
</p>
<p>requested his brother-in-law to inform the officer of his where-
</p>
<p>abouts, thus seeming to court arrest.
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. 75
</p>
<p>He had carefully thought the thing over, and concluded that
</p>
<p>the government would not be able to fix guilt upon him, and so
</p>
<p>he thought to have the benefit of a seeming willingness to be
</p>
<p>arrested, as presumptive proof of his innocence. He had gone
</p>
<p>to Washington on the I3th with three companions, ostensibly to
</p>
<p>see the parade and illumination in commemoration of the sur-
</p>
<p>render of Lee's army, and to " have a good time," as his com-
</p>
<p>panions expressed it in their evidence in his behalf on his
</p>
<p>defense.
</p>
<p>He kept with these companions in the rounds of their drunken
</p>
<p>carousal and debaucheries enough to blind them as to the real
</p>
<p>object of his visit. They were drinking freely during the Thursday
</p>
<p>and Friday of their stay, and were evidently unable to give a con-
</p>
<p>nected and reliable account of O'Laughlin's whereabouts during
</p>
<p>the whole of the time. They thought he spent most of the time
</p>
<p>in company with one or the other of them; but they admitted
</p>
<p>that he had had a long interview with Booth at his room at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel on Friday, the I4th. It was positively proven,
</p>
<p>however, that he was at the house of Secretary Stanton on the
</p>
<p>occasion of the reception given to General Grant on the night of
</p>
<p>the 1 3th; that he seemed to be in a state of partial intoxication,
</p>
<p>and pushed himself through the crowd into the hall inquiring for
</p>
<p>General Grant, saying he wanted to see him. He was told by the

<p>Secretary's son that that was no occasion for him to see him, and
</p>
<p>to step out onto the pavement where the carriage stopped, and he

<p>could see him. He stood for some time in the hall looking in
</p>
<p>through the door at the General. He also said he wanted to see

<p>Stanton, and being asked if it was the Secretary he wished to see,
</p>
<p>he said it was. The Secretary was pointed out to him, but he did

<p>not go to him. His manner was so impertinently obtrusive and
</p>
<p>rude that he was finally requested to leave, .and was escorted out
</p>
<p>of the house by the son of the Secretary. Mr. Stanton at first
</p>
<p>thought him to be intoxicated, but upon conversing with him
</p>
<p>concluded he was not. It would appear from all this that the part

<p>Booth had assigned to him was the assassination of General Grant,
</p>
<p>and that his visit to the house of the Secretary was for the purpose
</p>
<p>of so acquainting himself with the form and features of the General
</p>

</p>
<p>as to be able readily to identify him. Had not the General been
</p>
<p>called away on that Friday afternoon, had he accompanied the
</p>
<p>President to the theatre, as he had intended doing, there is
</p>
<p>scarcely a doubt that " Peanuts " would have had two horses to
</p>
<p>hold, or that some other arrangements would have been made for
</p>
<p>General Grant's assassination that would have made O'Laughlin a
</p>
<p>companion of Booth in his flight.
</p>
<p>We have now seen the development of Booth's plot, and its
</p>
<p>partial success, but, as to the real object of it, its entire failure.
</p>
<p>The thing proposed by the head conspirators, whose agents we
</p>
<p>have been following up in their efforts for its accomplishment,
</p>
<p>failed of its realization. They had hoped by the policy of assas-
</p>
<p>sination to put the rapidly waning cause of the confederacy on its
</p>
<p>feet again under new and more favorable auspices.
</p>
<p>The cause, at the time of this attempt to thus give it aid, was
</p>
<p>already lost on the field of military conflict beyond hope of recoveny.
</p>
<p>The whole people, North and South, saw that the war was at an end ;
</p>
<p>that the brief day of the so-called Southern Confederacy was over
</p>
<p>that its sun had set ; and great as must have been the disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment of those who had so fruitlessly plunged the country into the
</p>
<p>greatest civil war that history records, they were quite content to
</p>
<p>accept and make the best of their failure.
</p>
<p>Both parties were glad that the contest had been decided, and
</p>
<p>of the opportunity to lay down their arms, and return to the pur-
</p>
<p>suits of peaceful life. Had not Booth kept himself as full of
</p>
<p>whiskey as he was of his fiendish purpose, had he given himself
</p>
<p>an opportunity to scan the situation in a duly sober frame of mind,
</p>
<p>we think it even more than probable he would have abandoned
</p>
<p>the whole project as useless. But both he and his associates were
</p>
<p>free and constant drinkers, and by their frequent visits to saloons,
</p>
<p>as shown by the whole run of the testimony before the Commis-
</p>
<p>sion, it would seem probable that they scarcely ever drew an abso-
</p>
<p>lutely sober breath, and so could not realize the true situation of
</p>
<p>the cause they sought to serve.

<p>under the influence of alcoholic stimulants, and this may in some
</p>
<p>degree account for the obtundity of their moral perceptions. It
</p>
<p>has been said . by one who was personally cognizant of the fact,
</p>
<p>that alcohol precipitated the rebellion, and that its leaders in both
</p>
<p>branches of Congress kept themselves constantly under the excite-
</p>
<p>ment of alcoholic stimulants and so were made reckless of con-
</p>
<p>sequences.
</p>
<p>Arrest of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in giving the history of Booth's flight,
</p>
<p>we found him and Herold at the house of Dr. S. A. Mudd, at
</p>
<p>about four o'clock on the morning of the i$th of April, they hav-
</p>
<p>ing ridden thirty miles in about six hours after leaving Washington.
</p>
<p>They would no doubt have stopped at Mudd's, even had Booth not
</p>
<p>needed his services as a surgeon, for a short respite and refresh-
</p>
<p>ment, as the doctor was, as we shall hereafter see, a co-conspirator
</p>
<p>with Booth. Booth's broken leg had by this time become very
</p>
<p>painful, and this made it necessary that he should stop to have it
</p>
<p>dressed. Mudd dressed his leg, as he himself said, as well as he
</p>
<p>could with the means at his command, and giving them refresh-
</p>
<p>ments, he placed Booth in a chamber upstairs where he remained
</p>
<p>until about three o'clock in the afternoon. Mudd and Herold
</p>
<p>went out, aS Mudd said, to find a carriage in which to take Booth
</p>
<p>on his journey ; but it is more likely Mudd was showing Herold
</p>
<p>a by-way toward the Potomac, at the point where they expected
</p>
<p>to cross, whilst Booth was resting.
</p>
<p>About one o'clock on that afternoon, Lieutenant Dana, with
</p>
<p>a squad of cavalry, passed down toward Bryantown in pur-
</p>
<p>suit of Booth, and as there was no doubt a sharp look-out kept
</p>
<p>from the house of Dr. Mudd, which stood about a quarter of a
</p>
<p>mile from, and in full view of, the road, they were by this ad-
</p>
<p>monished of their danger and resumed their flight as soon as they
</p>
<p>could after the soldiers passed. Thus Mudd got them off of his
</p>
<p>hands, and started them on their way to his friend, Samuel Cox.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the i8th of April, Mudd was first interviewed, and then

<p>denied that there had been any body at his house on the I5th;
</p>
<p>but upon being pressed with questions, he finally said that two
</p>
<p>78 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>strangers had come to his house about four o'clock on Saturday
</p>
<p>morning on horseback, one of them having a broken leg, and that
</p>
<p>he had taken them in, dressed the leg, and had a crutch made for
</p>
<p>the man, and that they had left after breakfast, telling in what
</p>
<p>direction they had gone, but giving a false cue. He denied know-
</p>
<p>ing either of them, and said they were entire strangers to him,
</p>
<p>going on to give a minute description of the men and their horses
</p>
<p>as though desirous of- giving all the information he could, but
</p>
<p>with an appearance and manner that created distrust. Being
</p>
<p>asked if he knew Booth, he said he had been introduced to him at
</p>
<p>church in the fall before, but had no other acquaintance with
</p>
<p>him. Being asked if the man whose leg he had dressed waS not
</p>
<p>Booth, he said he was not. When told by the officer that he
</p>
<p>would have to search the house, his wife went upstairs and
</p>
<p>brought down a boot that Mudd had removed from Booth's foot
</p>
<p>by ripping it down in front, and it was seen that on the inside of
</p>
<p>the boot leg, near the top, was written, " J. Wilkes," and also the
</p>
<p>maker's name. Mudd was interviewed two or three times before
</p>
<p>his arrest, and prevaricated every time so much that he fre-
</p>
<p>quently contradicted himself. It was noticed that he was never
</p>
<p>at home when called for, but was not far off, as he always made
</p>
<p>his appearance in a short time when sent for by his wife. He was
</p>
<p>finally placed under arrest; and upon the photograph of Booth
</p>
<p>being shown to him, and being asked if that looked like Booth,
</p>
<p>he said he thought not, but finally concluded there was some
</p>
<p>resemblance to Booth across the eyes. He was taken to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington and held as a prisoner. Mudd was a physician, living on a
</p>
<p>farm. He had had a considerable number of slaves at the break-
</p>
<p>ing out of the rebellion, most of whom had left him during the
</p>
<p>previous winter. His father also, living in the neighborhood, was
</p>
<p>a large land and slave holder, and Mudd's disloyalty was no doubt
</p>
<p>of the rabid type. His home was a place of resort for returned
</p>
<p>rebel soldiers and recruiting parties, and he had a place of con-
</p>
<p>cealment in the pines near his house, where they were sheltered

<p>and cared for, the doctor sending their food to them by his slaves ;
</p>
<p>and if, at any time, any of these parties ventured to his house to
</p>
<p>take their meals, a slave was always placed on watch to give notice
</p>
<p>of the approach of any one.
</p>
<p>UNRAVELLING THE CONSPIRACY. 79
</p>
<p>The letter of introduction to Dr. Mudd which Booth had, as
</p>
<p>related by Arnold, had no doubt been presented in the fall, at the
</p>
<p>time Mudd admitted having been introduced to him at church ;
</p>
<p>and from that time their intimacy commenced. This was in
</p>
<p>November, 1864.
</p>
<p>About the 23d of December, 1864, Mudd visited Booth in
</p>
<p>Washington, and introduced him to John H. Surratt, under the
</p>
<p>following circumstances : Wiechmann and Surratt were on the
</p>
<p>street together, when Wiechmann heard some one call, " Surratt I
</p>
<p>Surratt ! " and turning round, they were met by Dr. Mudd and Booth.
</p>
<p>Mudd introduced Booth to Surratt, and then Surratt introduced
</p>
<p>both of them to Wiechmann. They went, by invitation of Booth,
</p>
<p>to the National Hotel, where Booth had a room, and were served
</p>
<p>by him with wine and cigars. Mudd went out into a passage and
</p>
<p>called Booth. They remained out of the room for a short time, and
</p>
<p>conversed in a low tone of voice. Upon their return to the room
</p>
<p>Booth called Surratt, and the three went out again into the passage,
</p>
<p>and were engaged for some time in a private conference. Upon
</p>
<p>their return, Mudd made an explanation, by way of apology, to
</p>
<p>Wiechmann, saying that Booth wanted to buy his farm, but he did
</p>
<p>not care to sell. Booth also apologized, giving the same excuse.
</p>
<p>The three then took seats around a table, when Booth took an
</p>
<p>envelope from his pocket, and upon this, with his pencil, com-
</p>
<p>menced drawing lines, as if marking roads. Whilst engaged in
</p>
<p>doing this the three were conversing in so low a tone that Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann could not hear what was said.
</p>
<p>Mudd made one or two other visits to Washington during the
</p>
<p>winter, and his business seemed always to be with Booth and
</p>
<p>Surratt. At least, he was always found in their company.
</p>
<p>According to one of Mudd's various statements, Booth and
</p>
<p>Herold left his house between three and four o'clock in the after-
</p>
<p>noon. It will be noted that he at first denied their having been
</p>
<p>there at all. Then he admitted that two strangers had been there
</p>
<p>on Saturday morning ; that he had dressed a broken leg for one

</p>
<p>of them, and had a crutch made for him, and they left after break-
</p>
<p>fast. That they remained until after Dana and his party passed
</p>
<p>down to Bryantown, there is no doubt ; and that they left as soon
</p>
<p>80 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>as possible, assisted by Mudd, after the soldiers passed, as we have
</p>
<p>heretofore seen. Mudd, after his conviction and sentence, whilst
</p>
<p>being conveyed to the Dry Tortugas, admitted, voluntarily, to
</p>
<p>Captain Dutton that he knew Booth when he came to his house
</p>
<p>on the morning of the I5th of April; and also that he went to
</p>
<p>Washington in December by appointment with Booth, to introduce
</p>
<p>him to Surratt. He might just as well have admitted his com-
</p>
<p>plicity in the conspiracy. Mudd's expression of countenance was
</p>
<p>that of a hypocrite. He had the bump of secretiveness largely
</p>
<p>developed ; and it would have taken months of favorable acquaint-
</p>
<p>anceship to have removed the unfavorable impression made by the
</p>
<p>first scanning of the man. He had the appearance of a natural
</p>
<p>born liar and deceiver.
</p>
<p>We have now Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, Edward Spangler, Lewis
</p>
<p>Payne, David E. Herold, Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>George A. Atzerodt, and Dr. Samuel Mudd under arrest and held
</p>
<p>for trial by the government under the charge of being co-con-
</p>
<p>spirators with John H. Surratt, Booth, and others yet to be named,
</p>
<p>and still others unknown and who never will be known. The evi-
</p>
<p>dence yet to be adduced makes it clear that there were quite a
</p>
<p>number of these conspirators in Washington at the time of the
</p>
<p>assassination who were never discovered, encouraging by their
</p>
<p>presence, and aiding and abetting, Booth and his associates.
</p>
<p>There are good reasons for believing that the purpose of Booth
</p>
<p>and his fellow-conspirators was known to many, both in Canada
</p>
<p>and the United States, who were interested in the destruction of
</p>
<p>our government. It may yet happen that a sufficient amount of
</p>
<p>evidence may be found to justify this, or some other writer, in
</p>
<p>making explicit charges that are for the present withheld.
</p>
<p>In regard to the persons above named who were put upon their
</p>
<p>trial, the writer will only say that, in giving an account of the
</p>
<p>grounds of arrest in each case, he has stated the facts proven by
</p>
<p>unimpeached witnesses before the Commission, whose testimony

<p>governed the decisions of the court in their respective cases, and

</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>What Sort of Trial should be given, Civil or Military ?
</p>
<p>THE first question that presented itself to the government in
</p>
<p>regard to these prisoners was, as to what kind of a trial should be
</p>
<p>given them, whether civil or military? The civil courts were open
</p>
<p>in the District of Columbia at the time, and had been all through
</p>
<p>the war. There was no question that a form of trial could be had
</p>
<p>in the civil courts ; but there was at the same time as little ques-
</p>
<p>tion that, under existing circumstances, such a trial would only
</p>
<p>result in a miscarriage of justice. The great crime had been com-
</p>
<p>mitted during the existence of a state of war, and the courts were
</p>
<p>only able to carry on their functions under the protection of the
</p>
<p>arms of the government.
</p>
<p>This aegis being withdrawn, the administration of justice through
</p>
<p>the civil courts would have been an impossibility, even in the
</p>
<p>capital of the nation ; and with this protection it was equally im-
</p>
<p>possible to secure the demands of justice through the civil courts
</p>
<p>in cases involving the issues of the war, as a jury of partizans
</p>
<p>could not be expected to decide impartially if all belonged to one
</p>
<p>party, and if divided on party lines, they could not be expected to
</p>
<p>decide at all. The latter alternative was the only one on which a
</p>
<p>jury could have been impaneled, under the rules of law, at that
</p>
<p>time, in the District of Columbia. Outside of the soldiery there
</p>
<p>were as many enemies as friends of the government in the popula-
</p>
<p>tion of the district, to say the least, and many of these enemies
</p>
<p>were passing under the guise of friends. In this state of things it
</p>
<p>was obvious that it would be futile to send these prisoners before
</p>
<p>a civil tribunal for trial. The government had evidence that a

<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. 83
</p>
<p>great conspiracy existed, the purpose of which was to aid the rebel
</p>
<p>cause by a series of assassinations, and that what had happened
</p>
<p>was in pursuance of that plan, but only its partial accomplishment.
</p>
<p>The extent of this conspiracy had not been fully revealed, but its
</p>
<p>spirit and purpose were known, and both wisdom and good policy
</p>
<p>required that it should be met with the utmost promptitude and
</p>
<p>suppressed with no faltering hand. These persons had been
</p>
<p>arrested by the military police, and were held as prisoners in
</p>
<p>military custody. They were held not as prisoners of war, but
</p>
<p>as secret active enemies of the government, guilty of a crime the
</p>
<p>purpose of which was to aid the rebellion, and this being their
</p>
<p>purpose, it took them out of the realm of civil, into the realm of
</p>
<p>martial, law. Their crime was regarded as an act of war, inas-
</p>
<p>much as its purpose was to aid the existing armed rebellion. The
</p>
<p>means by which they thus sought to give it aid were morally rep-
</p>
<p>rehensible, and such as had long been rejected by the enlightened
</p>
<p>sentiment of the civilized and Christian nations of the earth. The
</p>
<p>crime was a blow at the life of the nation, in the person of its
</p>
<p>chosen head, and was committed in the nation's capital, and within
</p>
<p>the intrenched lines and fortifications thereof ; and so it was decided
</p>
<p>that the prisoners were properly subject to a trial by a military
</p>
<p>commission.
</p>
<p>President Lincoln's order of September 25th, 1862, had not
</p>
<p>been rescinded and was still in force, and under this order the pris-
</p>
<p>oners were, from the purpose of their crime, subject to a military
</p>
<p>trial. They could not, under the articles of war, be sent before a
</p>
<p>court-martial for trial, but could, under martial law, which is
</p>
<p>only the common law in a state of war, be tried by a military
</p>
<p>commission.
</p>
<p>The chief conspirators, on whom rested the responsibility of the
</p>
<p>plot, were still at large, and in an attitude of desperate hos-
</p>
<p>tility towards the government. The extent of their plans, and the
</p>
<p>means at their command for their execution, could not be known,
</p>
<p>and so it was a matter of the utmost importance to deal with the

<p>of justice. The President requested the attorney general, Hon.

</p>
<p>opinion as to whether these persons implicated in this crime could
</p>
<p>be tried before a military tribunal, or must be tried before a civil
</p>
<p>court. As the reply of the Attorney General furnishes an exhaus-
</p>
<p>tive discussion of the different conditions existing under a state of
</p>
<p>peace and a state of war, and shows that whilst in a state of peace
</p>
<p>the Constitution throws its shield of protection over the life,
</p>
<p>liberty, and property of the citizen, even the humblest, its pro-
</p>
<p>visions cannot afford protection to these in a state of war, and
</p>
<p>that martial law, or the common law of war comes in in the place of
</p>
<p>the Constitution to ameliorate as much as possible the miseries of
</p>
<p>war, and secure, as far as possible, the ends of justice and mercy ;
</p>
<p>and as it constitutes a most important and interesting document
</p>
<p>worthy of the careful study of every young man who desires to

<p>The President was assassinated at a theatre in the city of Washington. At the

<p>and the President's house and person were, or should have been, under the guard of
</p>
<p>soldiers. Martial law had been declared in the District of Columbia, but the civil courts
</p>
<p>were open and held their regular sessions, and transacted business as in times of peace.
</p>
<p>Such being the facts, the question is one of great importance, important because it
</p>
<p>involves the constitutional guarantees thrown about the rights of the citizen, and because
</p>
<p>the security of the army and government in time of war is involved; important, as it
</p>
<p>involves a seeming conflict between the laws of peace and war. Having given the

<p>question propounded the patient and earnest consideration its magnitude and importance

<p>require, I will proceed to give the reasons why I am of the opinion that the conspirators
</p>
<p>not only may but ought to be tried by a military tribunal. A civil court of the United
</p>
<p>States is created by a law of Congress, under and according to the Constitution. To
</p>
<p>the Constitution and the law we must look to ascertain how the court is constituted, the
</p>
<p>limits of its jurisdiction, and what its mode of procedure. A military tribunal exists

<p>under and according to the Constitution in time of war. Congress may prescribe how
</p>
<p>all such tribunals are to be constituted, what shall be their jurisdiction and mode of
</p>
<p>procedure. Should Congress fail to create such tribunals, then, under the Constitution,
</p>
<p>they must be constituted according to the laws and usages of civilized warfare. They
</p>
<p>may take cognizance of such offences as the laws of war permit; they must proceed
</p>
<p>according to the customary usages of such tribunals in time of war, and inflict such
</p>
<p>punishments as are sanctioned by the practice of civilized nations in time of war. In
</p>
<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. 85
</p>
<p>time of peace, neither Congress nor the military can create any military tribunals, except
</p>
<p>such as are made in pursuance of that clause of the Constitution which gives to Congress
</p>
<p>the power "to make rules for the government of the land and naval forces." I do
</p>
<p>not think that Congress can, in time of war or peace, under this clause of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, create military tribunals for the adjudication of offenses committed by persons not
</p>
<p>engaged in, or belonging to, such forces.
</p>
<p>This is a proposition too plain for argument. But it does not follow that because
</p>
<p>such military tribunals cannot be created by Congress under this clause that they cannot
</p>
<p>be created at all. Is there no other power conferred by the Constitution upon Congress
</p>
<p>or the military under which such tribunals may be created in time of war ? That the law
</p>
<p>of nations constitutes a part of the law of the land must be admitted. The laws of nations
</p>
<p>are expressly made laws of the land by the Constitution when it says that " Congress
</p>
<p>shall have power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,
</p>
<p>and offences against the law of nations. To define is to give the limits or precise mean-
</p>
<p>ing of a word or thing in being; to make is to call into being. Congress has power to
</p>
<p>define, not to make, the laws of nations; but Congress has power to make rules for the
</p>
<p>government of the army and navy. From the very face of the Constitution, then, it is
</p>
<p>evident that the laws of nations do constitute a part of the laws of the land. But
</p>
<p>very soon after the organization of the federal government, Mr. Randolph, then attorney
</p>
<p>general, said: "The law of nations, although not specifically adopted by the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, is essentially a part of the law of the land. Its obligation commences and runs
</p>
<p>with the existence of a nation, subject to some modifications on points of indifference."
</p>
<p>The framers of the Constitution knew that a nation could not maintain an honorable
</p>
<p>place among the nations of the world that does not regard the great and essential prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the law of nations as a part of the law of the land. Hence Congress may
</p>
<p>define those laws but cannot abrogate them, or, as Mr. Randolph says, may "modify on
</p>
<p>some points of indifference."
</p>
<p>That the laws of nations constitute a part of the laws of the land, is established from
</p>
<p>the face of the Constitution upon principle and by authority. But the laws of war
</p>
<p>constitute much the greater part of the law of nations. Like the other laws of nations,
</p>
<p>they exist and are of binding force upon the departments and citizens of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, though not defined by any law of Congress. No one that has ever glanced at
</p>
<p>the many treatises that have been published in different ages of the world by great,
</p>
<p>good, and learned men, can fail to know that the laws of war constitute a part of the

</p>
<p>law of nations, and that those laws have been prescribed with tolerable accuracy. Con-
</p>
<p>gress can declare war. When war is declared it must be under the Constitution, carried
</p>
<p>on according to the known usages and laws of war among civilized nations. Under the
</p>
<p>power to define these laws, Congress cannot abrogate them, or authorize their infraction.
</p>
<p>The Constitution does not permit this government to prosecute a war as an uncivil-
</p>
<p>ized and barbarous people. As war is required by the frame-work of our government to
</p>
<p>be prosecuted according to the known usages of war among the civilized nations of the
</p>
<p>earth, it is important to understand what are the obligations, duties, and responsibilities
</p>
<p>imposed by war upon the military. Congress, not having defined, as under the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution it might have done, the laws of war, we must look to the usage of nations to
</p>
<p>ascertain the powers conferred in war, on whom the exercise of these powers devolve,
</p>
<p>over whom, and to what extent do these powers reach, and in how far the citizen and
</p>
<p>the soldier are bound by the legitimate use thereof. The power conferred by war is, of
</p>
<p>course, adequate to the end to be accomplished, and not greater than what is necessary
</p>
<p>86 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>to be accomplished. The law of war, like every other code of laws, declares what shall
</p>
<p>not be done, and does not say what may be done.
</p>
<p>The legitimate use of the great power of war, or rather the prohibitions upon the
</p>
<p>use of that power, increase or diminish as the necessity of the case demands. When a
</p>
<p>city is besieged and hard pressed the commander may exert an authority over the non-
</p>
<p>combatants which he may not when no enemy is near. All wars against a domestic
</p>
<p>enemy, or to repel invasions, are prosecuted to preserve the government. If the invad-
</p>
<p>ing force can be overcome by the ordinary civil police of a country, it should be done
</p>
<p>without bringing upon the country the terrible scourge of war; if a commotion or insur-
</p>
<p>rection can be put down by the ordinary process of law, the military should not be
</p>
<p>called out. A defensive foreign war is declared and carried on because the civil police
</p>
<p>is inadequate to repel it; a civil war is waged because the laws cannot be peacefully
</p>
<p>enforced by the ordinary tribunals of the country through civil process and by civil
</p>
<p>officers. Because of the utter inability to keep the peace and maintain order by cus-
</p>
<p>tomary officers and agencies in time of peace, armies are organized and put into the
</p>
<p>field. They are called out and invested with the powers of war to prevent total anarchy
</p>
<p>and to preserve the government.
</p>
<p>Peace is the normal condition of a country, and war abnormal, neither being without
</p>
<p>law, but each having laws appropriate to the condition of society. The maxim enter
</p>
<p>arma silent leges is never wholly true. The object of war is to bring society out of its
</p>
<p>abnormal condition; and the laws of war aim to have that done with the least possible
</p>
<p>injury to persons and property. Anciently, when two nations were at war the conqueror
</p>
<p>had, or asserted, the right to take from his enemy his life, liberty, and property: if
</p>
<p>either was spared it was a favor, or act of mercy. By the laws of nations, and of war
</p>
<p>as a part thereof, the conqueror was deprived of this right.
</p>
<p>When two governments, foreign to each other, are at war, or when a civil wai
</p>
<p>becomes territorial, all of the people of the respective belligerents become by the law
</p>
<p>of nations the enemies of each other. As enemies they cannot hold intercourse, but
</p>
<p>neither can kill or injure the other except under a commission from their respective gov-
</p>
<p>ernments. So humanizing have been, and are, the laws of war, that it is a high offense
</p>
<p>against them to kill an enemy without such commission. The laws of war demand that
</p>
<p>a man shall not take human life except under a license from his government; and under
</p>
<p>the Constitution of the United States no license can be given by any department of the
</p>
<p>government to take human life in war, except according to the law and usages of war.

</p>
<p>Soldiers regularly in the service have the license of the government to deprive men, the
</p>
<p>active enemies of their government, of their liberty and lives: their commission so to
</p>
<p>act is as perfect and as legal as that of a judge to adjudicate; but the soldier must act
</p>
<p>in obedience to the laws of war, as the judge must in obedience to the civil law. A
</p>
<p>civil judge must try criminals in the mode prescribed in the Constitution and the law;
</p>
<p>so, soldiers must kill or capture according to the laws of war. Non-combatants are not
</p>
<p>to be disturbed or interfered with by the armies of either party except in extreme cases.
</p>
<p>Armies are called out and organized to meet and overcome the active acting public
</p>
<p>enemies. But enemies with which armies have to deal are of two classes. I. Open,
</p>
<p>active participants in hostilities, as soldiers who wear the uniform, move under the flag,
</p>
<p>and hold the appropriate commission from their government, openly assuming to dis-
</p>
<p>charge the duties and meet the responsibilities and dangers of soldiers, they are entitled
</p>
<p>to all belligerent rights, and should receive all the courtesies due to soldiers. The true
</p>
<p>soldier is proud to acknowledge and respect those rights, and ever cheerfully extends
</p>
<p>QUESTION'S PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. 87
</p>
<p>these courtesies. 2. Secret, but active participants, as spies, brigands, bushwhackers,
</p>
<p>jayhawkers, war-rebels, and assassins. In all wars, and especially civil wars, such
</p>
<p>secret, active enemies rise up to annoy and attack an army, and must be met and put
</p>
<p>down by the army. When lawless wretches become so impudent and powerful as not
</p>
<p>to be controlled and governed by the ordinary tribunals of a country, armies are called
</p>
<p>out and the laws of war invoked. War has never been and can never be conducted on
</p>
<p>the principle that an army is but a posse comitalus of a civil magistrate. An army, like
</p>
<p>all other organized bodies, has a right, and its first duty is to protect its own existence,
</p>
<p>and the existence of all its parts, by the means and in the mode usual among civilized
</p>
<p>nations when at war. The question arises, then, do the laws of war authorize a differ-
</p>
<p>ent mode of proceeding and the use of different means against secret active enemies
</p>
<p>from those used against open active enemies? As has been said, the open enemy or
</p>
<p>soldier in time of war may be met in battle and killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, or
</p>
<p>so placed by the lawful strategy of war as that he is powerless. Unless the law of self-
</p>
<p>preservation absolutely demands it, the life of a wounded enemy or a prisoner must be
</p>
<p>spared.
</p>
<p>Unless pressed thereto by the extremest necessity, the laws of war condemn and
</p>
<p>punish with great severity harsh or cruel treatment to a wounded enemy or a prisoner.
</p>
<p>Certain stipulations and agreements, tacit or express, betwixt the open belligerent parties
</p>
<p>are permitted by the laws of war, and are held to be of a very high and sacred character.
</p>
<p>Such is the tacit understanding, or it may be usage of war, in regard to flags of truce.
</p>
<p>Flags of truce are resorted to as a means of saving human life, or alleviating human
</p>
<p>suffering. When not used with perfidy, the laws of war require that they should be
</p>
<p>respected. The Romans regarded embassadors betwixt belligerents as persons to be
</p>
<p>treated with consideration and respect. Plutarch, in his life of Caesar, tells us that the
</p>
<p>barbarians in Gaul, having sent some embassadors to Caesar, he detained them, charging
</p>
<p>fraudulent practices, and led his army to battle, obtaining a great victory. When the
</p>
<p>senate decreed festivals and sacrifices for the victory, Cato declared it to be his opinion
</p>
<p>that Caesar ought to be given into the hands of the barbarians, that so the guilt which
</p>
<p>this breach of faith might otherwise bring upon the state might be expiated by trans-
</p>
<p>ferring the curse on him who was the occasion of it. Under the Constitution and laws
</p>
<p>of the United States, should a commander be guilty of such a flagrant breach of law as
</p>
<p>Cato charged upon Caesar, he would not be delivered to the enemy, but would be pun-
</p>
<p>ished after a military trial.

</p>
<p>The many honorable gentlemen who hold commissions in the army of the United
</p>
<p>States, and have been deputed to conduct war according to the laws of war, would
</p>
<p>keenly feel it as an insult to their profession of arms for any one to say they could not
</p>
<p>or would not punish a fellow soldier who was wantonly guilty of cruelty to a prisoner,
</p>
<p>or perfidy towards the bearer of a flag of truce. The laws of war permit capitulations
</p>
<p>of surrender and paroles. They are agreements betwixt belligerents, and should be
</p>
<p>scrupulously observed and performed. They are contracts wholly unknown to civil tri-
</p>
<p>bunals. Parties to such contracts must answer any breaches thereof to the customary
</p>
<p>military tribunals in time of war. If an officer of rank, possessing the pride that
</p>
<p>becomes a soldier and a gentleman, who should capitulate to surrender his forces and
</p>
<p>property under his command and control, be charged with a fraudulent breach of the
</p>
<p>terms of surrender, the laws of war do not permit that he should be punished without a
</p>
<p>trial, or, if innocent, that he should have no means of wiping out the foul imputation.
</p>
<p>If a paroled prisoner is charged with a breach of his parole, he may be punished, if
</p>
<p>88 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>guilty, but not without a trial. He should be tried by a military tribunal, constituted
</p>
<p>and proceeding as the laws and usages of war prescribe.
</p>
<p>The law and usage of war contemplate that soldiers have a high sense of personal
</p>
<p>honor. The true soldier is proud to feel and know that his enemy possesses personal
</p>
<p>honor, and will conform and be obedient to the laws of war. In a spirit of justice,
</p>
<p>and with a wise appreciation of such feelings, the laws of war protect the honor and
</p>
<p>character of an open enemy. When, by the fortunes of war, one open enemy is thrown
</p>
<p>into the hands and power of another, and is charged with dishonorable conduct and a
</p>
<p>breach of the laws of war, he must be tried according to the usages of war. Justice
</p>
<p>and fairness say that an open enemy to whom dishonorable conduct is imputed has a
</p>
<p>right to demand a trial. If such a demand can be rightfully made, surely it cannot be
</p>
<p>rightfully refused. It is to be hoped that the military authorities of this country will
</p>
<p>never refuse such a demand because there is no act of Congress that authorizes it. In
</p>
<p>time of war the law and usages of war authorize it, and they are a part of the law of
</p>
<p>the land. One belligerent may request the other to punish for breaches of the laws of
</p>
<p>war, and, regularly, such a request should be made before retaliatory measures are-
</p>
<p>taken. Whether the laws of war have been infringed or not is, of necessity, a question,
</p>
<p>to be decided by the laws and usages of war, and is cognizable before a military tribunal.
</p>
<p>When prisoners of war conspire to escape, or are guilty of a breach of approp'riate and
</p>
<p>necessary rules of prison discipline, they may be punished, but not without trial. The
</p>
<p>commander who should order every prisoner charged with improper conduct to be shot
</p>
<p>or hung would be guilty of a high offense against the laws of war, and should be
</p>
<p>punished therefor after a military trial. If the culprit should be condemned and exe-
</p>
<p>cuted, the commander would be as free from guilt as if the man had been killed in
</p>
<p>battle. It is manifest from what has been said, that military tribunals exist under and
</p>
<p>according to the laws of war, in the interest of justice and mercy. They are established
</p>
<p>to save human life and to prevent cruelty as far as possible. The commander of an
</p>
<p>army in time of war has the same power to organize military tribunals and to execute
</p>
<p>their judgments that he has to set his squadrons in the field and fight battles. His
</p>
<p>authority in each case is from the laws and usages of war. Having seen that there
</p>
<p>must be military tribunals to decide questions arising in time of war betwixt belligerents,
</p>
<p>who are open and active enemies, let us next see whether the laws of war do not
</p>
<p>authorize such tribunals to determine the fate of those who are active but secret partici-
</p>
<p>pants in the hostilities. In Mr. Wharton's " Elements of International Law," he says:

<p>"The effect of a state of war, lawfully declared to exist, is to place all the subjects of
</p>
<p>each belligerent power in a state of natural hostility. The usage of nations has modi-
</p>
<p>fied this maxim by legalizing such acts of hostility only as are committed by those who
</p>
<p>are authorized by the express or implied command of the State, such as the regularly
</p>
<p>commissioned naval and military forces of the nation, and all others called out in its
</p>
<p>defense, or spontaneously defending themselves in case of necessity, without any express-
</p>
<p>authority for that purpose." Cicero tells us in his offices, that by the Roman feudal
</p>
<p>law no person could lawfully engage in battle with the public enemy without being reg-
</p>
<p>ularly enrolled, and taking the military oath. This was a regulation sanctioned both by
</p>
<p>policy and religion. The horrors of war would indeed be greatly aggravated if every
</p>
<p>individual of the belligerent States were allowed to plunder and slay indiscriminately
</p>
<p>the enemies' subjects without being in any manner accountable for his conduct. Hence v
</p>
<p>it is in land-wars irregular bands oj marauders are liable to be treated as lawless-
</p>
<p>banditti, not entitled to the protection of the mitigated usages of war as practiced by
</p>
<p>civilized nations.
</p>
<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. 89
</p>
<p>In speaking upon the subject of banditti, Patrick Henry said in the Virginia Conven-
</p>
<p>tion : " The honorable gentleman has given you an elaborate account of what he judges
</p>
<p>tyrannical legislation, and an ex-post facto law (in the case of Josiah Philips); he has mis-
</p>
<p>interpreted the facts. That man was not executed by a tyrannical stroke of power, nor
</p>
<p>was he a Socrates; he was a fugitive murderer and an outlaw; a man who commanded
</p>
<p>an infamous banditti, and at a time when the war was at the most perilous stage he com-
</p>
<p>mitted the most cruel and shocking barbarities; he was an enemy to the human name.
</p>
<p>Those who declare war against the human race may be struck out of existence as sooa
</p>
<p>as apprehended. He was not executed according to those beautiful legal ceremonies,
</p>
<p>which are pointed out by the law in criminal cases. The enormity of his crime did not
</p>
<p>entitle him to it. I am truly a friend to legal forms and methods; but, sir, the occasion
</p>
<p>warranted the measure. A pirate, an outlaw, or a common enemy to all mankind may
</p>
<p>be put to death at any time. It is justified by the law of war and of nations." No
</p>
<p>reader, not to say student, of the law of nations can doubt that Mr. Wheaton and Mr.
</p>
<p>Henry have fairly stated the laws of war. Let it be constantly borne in mind that they
</p>
<p>are talking of the law in a state of war. These banditti that spring up in time of war
</p>
<p>are respecters of no law, human or divine, of peace or of war, are hastes humani generis,
</p>
<p>and may be hunted down like wolves. Thoroughly desperate and perfectly lawless, no
</p>
<p>man can be required to peril his life in venturing to take them prisoners; as prisoners
</p>
<p>no trust can be reposed in them. But they are occasionally made prisoners. Being
</p>
<p>prisoners, what is to be done with them? If they are public enemies, assuming and
</p>
<p>exercising the right to kill, and are not regularly authorized to do so, they must be
</p>
<p>apprehended and dealt with by the military. No man can doubt the right and duty of
</p>
<p>the military to make prisoners of them, and being public enemies it is the duty of the
</p>
<p>military to punish them for any infractions of the laws of war.
</p>
<p>But the military cannot ascertain whether they are guilty or not without the aid of a
</p>
<p>military tribunal. In all wars, and especially in civil wars, secret but active enemies are
</p>
<p>almost as numerous as open ones. That fact has contributed to make civil wars such
</p>
<p>scourges to the countries in which they rage. In nearly all foreign wars the contending
</p>
<p>parties speak different languages and have different habits and manners, but in most
</p>
<p>civil wars that is not the case; hence there is a security in participating secretly in
</p>
<p>hostilities that induces many to thus engage. War prosecuted according to the most
</p>
<p>civilized usage is horrible, but its horrors are greatly aggravated by the immemorial
</p>
<p>habits of plunder, rape, and murder practiced by secret but active participants. Certain

</p>
<p>laws and usages have been adopted by the civilized world in wars between nations that
</p>
<p>are not of kin to one another, for the purpose and to the effect of arresting or softening
</p>
<p>many of the necessary cruel consequences of war. How strongly bound are we, then,
</p>
<p>in the midst of a great war where brother and personal friend are fighting against
</p>
<p>brother and friend, to adopt and be governed by these usages. A public enemy must or
</p>
<p>should be dealt with in all wars by the same laws. The fact they are public enemies
</p>
<p>being the same, they should deal with each other according to those laws of war that are
</p>
<p>contemplated by the Constitution.
</p>
<p>Whatever rules have been adopted and practiced by the civilized nations of the
</p>
<p>world in war to soften its hardships and severity should be adopted and practiced by us
</p>
<p>in this war. That the laws of war authorize commanders to create and establish military
</p>
<p>commissions, courts or tribunals for the trial of offenders against the laws of "war,
</p>
<p>whether they be open or secret participants in the hostilities, cannot be denied. That
</p>
<p>the judgments of such tribunals may have been sometimes harsh, and sometimes even
</p>
<p>90 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>tyrannical, does not prove that they ought not to exist, nor does it prove that they are
</p>
<p>not constituted in the interest of justice and mercy. Considering the power that the
</p>
<p>laws of war give over secret participants in hostilities, such as banditti, guerillas, spies,
</p>
<p>etc., the position of a commander would be miserable indeed if he could not call to his
</p>
<p>aid the judgments of such tribunals; he would become a mere butcher of men without
</p>
<p>the power to ascertain justice, and there can be no mercy where there is no justice.
</p>
<p>War in its mildest form is horrible ; but take away from the contending armies the ability
</p>
<p>and right to organize what is now known as a Bureau of Military Justice, they would
</p>
<p>soon become monster savages unrestrained by any and all ideas of law and justice.
</p>
<p>Surely no lover of mankind, no one that respects law and order, no one that has the
</p>
<p>instinct of justice or that can be softened by mercy, would in time of war take away
</p>
<p>from the commanders the right to organize military tribunals of justice, and especially
</p>
<p>such tribunals for the protection of persons charged or suspected of being secret foes and
</p>
<p>participants in hostilities. It would be a miracle if the records and history of this war
</p>
<p>do not show occasional cases in which those tribunals have erred; but they will show
</p>
<p>many, very many cases in which human life would have been taken but for the interpo-
</p>
<p>sition and judgments of these tribunals. Every student of the laws of war must
</p>
<p>acknowledge that such tribunals exert a kindly and benign influence in time of war.
</p>
<p>Impartial history will record the fact that the Bureau of Military Justice, regularly
</p>
<p>organized during this war, lias saved human life and prevented human suffering. The
</p>
<p>greatest suffering patiently endured by soldiers, and the hardest battles gallantly fought
</p>
<p>during this protracted struggle, are not more creditable to the American character than
</p>
<p>the establishment of this bureau.
</p>
<p>This people have such an educated and profound respect for law and justice, such
</p>
<p>a love of mercy, that they have in the midst of this greatest of civil wars systematized
</p>
<p>and brought into regular order tribunals that before this war existed under the law of
</p>
<p>war, but without general rule. To condemn the tribunals that have been established
</p>
<p>under this bureau is to condemn and denounce the war itself, or, justifying the war, to
</p>
<p>insist that it shall be prosecuted according to the harshest rules, and without the aid of
</p>
<p>laws, usages, and customary agencies for mitigating those rules. If such tribunals had
</p>
<p>not existed before, under the laws and usages of war, the American citizen might as
</p>
<p>proudly point to their establishment as to our inimitable and inestimable Constitutions.
</p>
<p>It must be constantly borne in mind that such tribunals and such a bureau cannot exist
</p>
<p>except in time of war, and cannot then take cognizance of offenders and offenses where

</p>
<p>the civil courts are open, except offenders and offenses against the laws of war. But it
</p>
<p>is insisted by some, and doubtless with honesty, and with a zeal commensurate with
</p>
<p>their honesty, that such tribunals can have no constitutional existence. The argument
</p>
<p>against their constitutionality may be shortly, and I think, fairly stated thus : Congress
</p>
<p>alone can establish military or civil judicial tribunals. As Congress has not established
</p>
<p>military tribunals, except such as have been created under the articles of war, and
</p>
<p>which articles are made in pursuance of that clause in the Constitution which gives to
</p>
<p>Congress the power to make rules for the government of the army and navy, any other
</p>
<p>tribunal is and must be plainly unconstitutional, and all its acts void. This objection,
</p>
<p>thus stated, or stated in any form, begs the question. It assumes that Congress alone
</p>
<p>can establish military judicial tribunals. Is that assumption true ?
</p>
<p>We have seen that when war comes, the laws and usages of war come with it, and
</p>
<p>that during the war they are a part of the laws of the land. Under the Constitution,
</p>
<p>Congress may define and punish offenses against those laws, but in default of Congress
</p>
<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. 91
</p>
<p>defining those laws and prescribing punishment for their infraction, and the mode of
</p>
<p>proceeding to ascertain whether an offense has been committed, and what punishment
</p>
<p>is to be inflicted, the army must be governed by the laws and usages of war as under-
</p>
<p>stood and practiced by the civilized nations of the world. It has been abundantly
</p>
<p>shown that these tribunals are constituted by the army in the interest of justice and
</p>
<p>mercy, and for the purpose and to the effect of mitigating the horrors of war.
</p>
<p>But it may be insisted that though the law of war, being part of the law of nations, con-
</p>
<p>stitute a part of the laws of the land, that those laws must be regarded as modified so far,
</p>
<p>and whenever they come in direct conflict with plain constitutional provisions. The follow-
</p>
<p>ing clauses of the constitution are principally relied upon to show the conflict betwixt the
</p>
<p>laws of war and the Constitution. " The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeach-
</p>
<p>ment, shall be by the jury, and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime
</p>
<p>shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial shall be
</p>
<p>at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed." " No person shall
</p>
<p>be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or
</p>
<p>indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the
</p>
<p>militia when in actual service, in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be
</p>
<p>subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be com-
</p>
<p>pelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself, nor be deprived of life,
</p>
<p>liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for
</p>
<p>public use without just compensation" (Article V. of the amendments). In all crim-
</p>
<p>inal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right of a speedy and public trial by an
</p>
<p>impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed,
</p>
<p>which district shall have prievously been ascertained by law, and be informed of the
</p>
<p>nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with witnesses against him, to
</p>
<p>have compulsory process for obtaining witnessess in his favor, and to have the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of counsel for his defense " (Article VI. of the amendments). These provisions
</p>
<p>of the Constitution are intended to fling around the life, liberty and property of a citizen
</p>
<p>all the guarantees of a jury trial.
</p>
<p>These constitutional guarantees cannot be estimated too highly, or protected too
</p>
<p>sacredly. The reader of history knows that for many weary ages the people suffered for
</p>
<p>the want of them; it would not only be stupidity but madness in us not to preserve them.
</p>
<p>No man has a deeper conviction of their value, or a more sincere desire to preserve and
</p>
<p>perpetuate them, than I have. Nevertheless, these sacred and exalted provisions of the

<p>Constitution must not be read alone and by themselves, but must be read and taken in
</p>
<p>connection with other provisions. The Constitution was framed by great men men of
</p>
<p>learning and large experience, and it is a wonderful monument of their wisdom. Well
</p>
<p>versed in the history of the world, they knew that the nation for which they were fram-
</p>
<p>ing a government would, unless all history were false, have wars foreign and domestic.
</p>
<p>Hence the government framed by them is clothed with the power to make and carry
</p>
<p>on a war. As has been shown, when war comes the laws of war come with it. In-
</p>
<p>fractions of the laws of nations are not denominated crimes, but offenses. Hence the
</p>
<p>expression in the Constitution that Congress shall have power to define and punish
</p>
<p>offenses against the law of nations. Many of the offenses against the law of nations
</p>
<p>for which a man may lose his life, his liberty, or his property are not crimes. It is an
</p>
<p>offense against the law of nations to break a lawful blockade, and for which a forfeiture
</p>
<p>of the property is the penalty, and yet the running of a blockade has never been con-
</p>
<p>sidered a crime; to hold communication or intercourse with the enemy is a high offense
</p>
<p>92 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>against the laws of war, and for which those laws prescribe punishment, and yet it is.
</p>
<p>not a crime ; to act as a spy is an offense against the laws of war, and the penalty for
</p>
<p>which, in all ages, has been death, and yet it is not a crime ; to violate a flag of truce-
</p>
<p>is an offense against the laws of war, and yet it is not a crime of which a civil court can.
</p>
<p>take cognizance; to unite with banditti, jayhawkers, guerrillas, or any other unauthorized-
</p>
<p>marauders is a high offense against the laws of war ; the offense is complete when the
</p>
<p>band is organized or joined. The atrocities committed by such a band do not constitute
</p>
<p>the offenses, but make the reasons, and sufficient reasons they are, why such banditti
</p>
<p>are denounced by the laws of war. Some of the offenses against the laws of war are
</p>
<p>crimes, and some are not. Because they are crimes they do not cease to be offenses-
</p>
<p>against the laws of war; nor because they are not crimes or misdemeanors do they fail
</p>
<p>to be offenses against the laws of war. Murder is a crime, and the murderer, as such,
</p>
<p>must be proceeded against in the form and manner prescribed by the Constitution. In
</p>
<p>committing the murder an offense may also have been committed against the laws of
</p>
<p>war; for that offense he must answer to the laws of war, and the tribunals legalized
</p>
<p>by that law. There is, then, an apparent but no real conflict in the constitutional
</p>
<p>provisions.
</p>
<p>Offenses against the laws of war must be dealt with and punished under the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, as the laws of war, they being a part of the law of nations, direct; crimes
</p>
<p>must be dealt with and punished as the Constitution, and laws made in pursuance thereof,
</p>
<p>may direct. Congress has not undertaken to define the code of war nor to punish offenses-
</p>
<p>against it. In the case of a spy, Congress has undertaken to say who shall be deemed a
</p>
<p>spy and how he shall be punished. But every lawyer knows that a spy was a well known
</p>
<p>offender under the laws of war, and that under, and according, to these laws he could have
</p>
<p>been tried and punished without an act of Congress. " This is admitted by the act of Con-
</p>
<p>gress when it says that he shall suffer death " according to the laws and usuages of war,"
</p>
<p>The act is simply declaratory of the law. That portion of the Constitution which declares
</p>
<p>that no " person shall be deprived of his life, liberty or property without due process of
</p>
<p>law " has such direct reference to and connection with trials for crime and criminal
</p>
<p>prosecutions, that comment upon it would seem to be unnecessary. Trials for offenses
</p>
<p>against the laws of war are not embraced nor intended to be embraced in these provisions.
</p>
<p>If this is not so, then every man who kills another in battle is a murderer, for he deprived
</p>
<p>a "person of life without that due process of law" contemplated by this provision;
</p>
<p>every soldier that marches across a field in battle array is liable to an action for trespass,,

</p>
<p>because he does so without that due process of law. The argument that flings around
</p>
<p>offenders against the laws of war these guarantees of the Constitution would convict
</p>
<p>all the soldiers of our army of murder; no prisoners could be taken and held; the
</p>
<p>army could not move.
</p>
<p>The absurd consequences that would of necessity flow from such an argument show-
</p>
<p>that it cannot be the true construction it cannot be what was intended by the
</p>
<p>framers of that instrument. One of the prime motives for the Union and a federal
</p>
<p>government was to confer the powers of war. If any provisions of the Constitution
</p>
<p>are so in conflict with the power to carry on war as to destroy and make it valueless,
</p>
<p>then the instrument, instead of being a great and wise one, is a miserable failure, a felo
</p>
<p>de se. If any man should sue out a writ of habeas corpus, and the returns show that he
</p>
<p>belonged to the army or navy, and was held to be tried for some offense against the
</p>
<p>rules and articles of war, the writ should be dismissed, and the party remanded to
</p>
<p>answer to the charges. So, in time of war, if a man should sue out a writ of habeas
</p>
<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. 93
</p>
<p>corpus, and it is made appear that he is in the hands of the military as a prisoner of
</p>
<p>-war, the writ should be dismissed, and the prisoner remanded to be disposed of as the
</p>
<p>laws and usages of war require. If the prisoner be a regular unoffending soldier of
</p>
<p>the opposing party to the war, he should be treated with all the courtesy and kindness
</p>
<p>consistent with safe custody; if he has offended against the laws of war he should
</p>
<p>.have such a trial, and be punished as the laws of war require. A spy, though a
</p>
<p>prisoner of war, may be tried, condemned, and executed by a military tribunal without
</p>
<p>a breach of the Constitution. A bushwhacker, a jayhawker, a bandit, a war rebel, an
</p>
<p>assassin, being public enemies, may be tried, condemned, and executed as offenders
</p>
<p>against the laws of war.
</p>
<p>The soldier that would fail to try a spy or a bandit after his capture would be as
</p>
<p>derelict in duty as if he were to fail to capture; he is as much bound to try and exe-
</p>
<p>cute, if guilty, as he is to arrest; the same law that makes it his duty to pursue and
</p>
<p>kill or capture makes it his duty to try according to the usages of war. The judge of
</p>
<p>a civil court is not more strongly bound, under the Constitution and the law, to try a
</p>
<p>criminal, than is the military to try an offender against the laws of war. The fact that
</p>
<p>4he civil courts are open does not affect the right of the military tribunal to hold as a
</p>
<p>prisoner and to try. The civil courts have no more right to prevent the military, in
</p>
<p>time of war, from trying an offender against the laws of war than they have a right
</p>
<p>to interfere and prevent a battle. A battle may be lawfully fought in the very presence
</p>
<p>of the court; so a spy, a bandit, or other offender against the law of war, may be
</p>
<p>tried, and tried lawfully, when and where the civil courts are open and transacting
</p>
<p>business. The law of war authorizes human life to be taken without legal process; or
</p>
<p>that legal process contemplated by those provisions of the Constitution that are relied
</p>
<p>upon to show that military judicial tribunals are unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>Wars should be prosecuted justly as well as bravely. One enemy in the power of
</p>
<p>another, whether he be an open or a secret one, should not be punished or executed
</p>
<p>without a trial. If the question be one concerning the laws of war, he should be tried
</p>
<p>by those engaged in the war; they, and they only, are his peers. The military must
</p>
<p>decide whether he is, or is not, an active participant in hostilities. If he is an active
</p>
<p>participant in the hostilities it is the duty of the military to take him, without warrant
</p>
<p>or other judicial process, and dispose of him as the laws of war direct. It is curious
</p>
<p>to see one and the same mind justify the killing of thousands of men in battle because
</p>
<p>it is done according to the laws of war, and yet condemning that same law when, out

</p>
<p>of regard for justice, and with the hope of saving life, it orders a military trial before
</p>
<p>the enemy are killed. The love of law, of justice, and the wish to save life and suffer-
</p>
<p>ing should impel all good men in time of war to uphold and sustain the existence and
</p>
<p>actions of such tribunals. The object of such tribunals is obviously intended to save
</p>
<p>life, and when their jurisdiction is confined to offenses against the laws of war, that is
</p>
<p>their effect. They prevent indiscriminate slaughter; they prevent men from being
</p>
<p>punished or killed on mere suspicion. The law of nations, which is the result of the
</p>
<p>wisdom and experience of ages, has decided that jayhawkers, banditti, etc., are
</p>
<p>offenders against the laws of nature and of war, and as such amenable to the military.
</p>
<p>Our Constitution has made those laws a part of the law of the land. Obedience to
</p>
<p>the Constitution and the law, then, requires that the military should do their whole
</p>
<p>duty; they must not only meet and fight the enemies of the country in open battle,
</p>
<p>lmt they must kill or take the secret enemies of the country and try and execute them
</p>
<p>according to the laws of war.
</p>
<p>94 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>The civil tribunals of the country cannot rightfully interfere with the military in the
</p>
<p>performance of their high, arduous, and perilous but lawful duties. That Booth and
</p>
<p>his associates were secret active public enemies no mind that contemplates the facts
</p>
<p>can doubt. The exclamation used by him when he escaped from the box onto the
</p>
<p>stage, after he fired the fatal shot, sic semper tyrannis, and his dying message, " Say
</p>
<p>to my mother that I died for my country," show that he was not an assassin from
</p>
<p>private malice, but that he acted as a public foe. Such a deed is expressly laid down
</p>
<p>in Vattel, in his work on the law of nations, as an offense against the laws of war and a
</p>
<p>great crime: " I give then the name of assassination to a treacherous murder, whether
</p>
<p>the perpetrators of the deed be the subjects of the party whom we cause to be assas-
</p>
<p>sinated or of our own sovereign, or that it be executed by any other emissary introducing
</p>
<p>himself as a suppliant, a refugee, or a deserter, or in fine as a stranger " (Vattel, 339.)
</p>
<p>Neither the civil nor the military department of the government should regard itself
</p>
<p>as wiser and better than the Constitution and the laws that exist under or are made in
</p>
<p>pursuance thereof. Each department should, in peace and in war, confining itself to-
</p>
<p>ils own proper sphere of action, diligently and fearlessly perform its legitimate func-
</p>
<p>tions, and in the mode prescribed by the Constitution and the law. Such obedience to
</p>
<p>and observance of law will maintain peace when it exists, and will soonest relieve the
</p>
<p>country from the abnormal state of war.
</p>
<p>My conclusion, therefore, is, that if the persons who are charged with the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the President committed the deed as public enemies, as I believe they did, and
</p>
<p>whether they did or not is a question to be decided by the tribunal before which
</p>
<p>they are tried, they not only can, but ought to be tried before a military tribunal. If
</p>
<p>the persons charged have offended against the laws of war, it would be especially
</p>
<p>wrong for the military to hand them over to the civil courts, as it would be wrong in a
</p>
<p>civil court to convict a man of murder who had in time of war killed another in battle-

</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion of the constitutional aspects of the
</p>
<p>question will no doubt be regarded by most people as somewhat
</p>
<p>tedious, and perhaps outside of the legal profession will be read,
</p>
<p>much less carefully studied, by but few. Yet by those who study
</p>
<p>it, it will be found to be a most profound and masterly analysis of
</p>
<p>the questions involved, viz., those of military and civil jusridiction

<p>as provided for in the Constitution, and to fully justify the opinion
</p>
<p>given as the conclusion of the argument.
</p>
<p>We cannot too highly revere the Constitution, as it is that
</p>
<p>which gives permanence, security, and prosperity to our national
</p>
<p>life ; yet there is a power greater than the Constitution a power
</p>
<p>that by authority expressed or understood reserves the right to
</p>
<p>amend, alter, or abolish its provisions. That power is the
</p>
<p>sovereignty that resides in the people. Self preservation is a

<p>QUESTIONS PRELIMINARY TO THE TRIAL. * 95
</p>
<p>national, as much as an individual instinct, and self preservation is
</p>
<p>the first law of nature.
</p>
<p>A government that has a right to live has a right to the use of
</p>
<p>all the means that may be found indispensable to the perpetuation
</p>
<p>of its existence. When war comes the laws of war come with it
</p>
<p>as a matter of necessity; because war, being an abnormal state of
</p>
<p>society, brings with it conditions that render inoperative and use-
</p>
<p>less the means provided for the safety and security of the life,
</p>
<p>liberty, and property of the citizen, as guaranteed by the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution and laws. These interests are too sacred to be left wholly
</p>
<p>unprotected ; and so the civilized nations of the world have
</p>
<p>adopted those rules which the wisdom and experience of mankind
</p>
<p>have found necessary for their protection in time of war. These
</p>
<p>rules, or laws, we denominate the laws of war. If the experience
</p>
<p>of mankind should dictate modifications of, or additions to, those
</p>
<p>rules for the better protection of these sacred interests of life,
</p>
<p>liberty, and property, it would be as proper to amend these as it
</p>
<p>is proper and competent to amend statute law, or to alter, amend,
</p>
<p>or abolish constitutions. Such additions or alterations, if wisely
</p>
<p>made, receive the sanction of mankind, and thus become a part of
</p>
<p>the unwritten law, having in them the authority of this sanction.
</p>
<p>In dealing with this question, however, it was not found neces-
</p>
<p>sary that anything new should be devised, as the laws of war were
</p>
<p>found to authorize all that was necessary to the adjudication of
</p>
<p>the question, and to furnish the means and appliances for securing
</p>
<p>the ends of justice.
</p>
<p>The nature of the offense charged against these prisoners
</p>
<p>placed them under the domain of martial law, as they were shown
</p>
<p>by their own acts and declarations to be secret, active enemies of
</p>
<p>the government, the purpose of their crime being to give aid to
</p>
<p>the existing rebellion. For this reason the government left them
</p>
<p>in the hands of the military to be dealt with according to the laws
</p>
<p>of war ; and the President, being ex-officio Commander-in-Chief of
</p>
<p>the army and navy, ordered the Assistant Adjutant General of the

<p>army to detail a military commission, and send the accuse before
</p>
<p>it for a speedy trial.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.
</p>
<p>A MILITARY COMMISSION ITS NATURE, CONSTITUTION, DUTIES,
</p>
<p>AND JURISDICTION.
</p>
<p>A MILITARY commission, as we have seen, is a judicial tribunal
</p>
<p>authorized by and constituted under the laws of war during a
</p>
<p>state of war. It consists of a definite number of commissioned
</p>
<p>officers designated by the order of detail. Its jurisdiction is
</p>
<p>limited, and its duties are also prescribed by that order. It is
</p>
<p>a military court detailed to try offenders against the laws of war,
</p>
<p>and clothed with power to decide both on the law and evidence in
</p>
<p>the case, and to prescribe the punishment due to the offense. It
</p>
<p>is constituted to act under a presiding officer, who is also desig-
</p>
<p>nated in the order of detail. It has the assistance of a judge
</p>
<p>advocate with whom it consults in regard to any questions of law
</p>
<p>or of evidence that may arise.
</p>
<p>The office of a judge advocate does not exactly correspond with
</p>
<p>that of a states attorney in a civil court, for at the same time that
</p>
<p>it is his duty to see that the case of the government and the evi-
</p>
<p>dence are fairly presented, it is as much his duty to see that the
</p>
<p>accused shall have a fair and impartial trial. The party on trial
</p>
<p>has the right to have counsel of his own choice, and the govern-
</p>
<p>ment must secure the attendance of such witnesses in his defense
</p>
<p>as he may designate. The rules of law and of evidence are very
</p>
<p>nearly the same as those which prevail in the civil courts. A mili-
</p>
<p>tary commission combines, to a great extent, the functions of both
</p>
<p>court and jury, as it has to decide on questions of law and evi-
</p>
<p>dence as a court, and on the guilt or innocence of the accused, in
</p>
<p>the light of law and evidence, as a jury. Again, in rendering a
</p>
<p>sentence, in case of conviction, it exercises the functions of a court.

<p>The Commission then proceeded to consider the rules and
</p>
<p>regulations by which its proceedings should be governed or con-
</p>
<p>ducted. The prisoners were served, as we have seen, with a due
</p>
<p>notice of the offenses with which they were charged, and required
</p>
<p>to be confronted with the witnesses against them. They were
</p>
<p>allowed the benefit of counsel of their own choice and compulsory
</p>
<p>attendance of witnesses in their defense. In short, they were
</p>
<p>accorded every condition that was necessary to a fair and impar-
</p>
<p>tial trial. In this case the only qualification required of the
</p>
<p>counsel selected or employed by the accused in their defense was,
</p>
<p>that they should submit or file evidence of having taken the oath
</p>
<p>required by an act of Congress, or should take said oath before
</p>
<p>being permitted to appear in the case.
</p>
<p>The examination of witnesses was conducted on the part of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment by the Judge Advocate and by counsel on the part of the
</p>
<p>accused. The evidence was taken down by short-hand reporters who
</p>
<p>'were sworn to record the evidence faithfully and truly, and not to
</p>
<p>communicate the same, or any part of the proceedings on the trial,
</p>
<p>except by authority of the presiding officer. They were required
</p>
<p>to furnish a copy of the evidence taken each day to the Judge
</p>
<p>Advocate, and also a copy to prisoners' counsel. No reporters
</p>
<p>except the official reporters were allowed access to the court-
</p>
<p>room. The Judge Advocate, however, was allowed to furnish to
</p>
<p>the agent of the Associated Press, at his discretion, a copy of such
</p>
<p>testimony and proceedings as might be published during the trial
</p>
<p>without injury to the public and to the ends of justice. All other
</p>
<p>publication of the evidence and of the proceedings during the trial
</p>
<p>was forbidden, and was to be dealt with as a contempt of court.
</p>
<p>The testimony being closed, the case was to be immediately
</p>
<p>summed up by one judge advocate, selected by the Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate General, to be followed or opened, if the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>General so selected, by counsel for the prisoners, and the argument
</p>
<p>closed by one judge advocate.
</p>
<p>The argument being closed, the court was to proceed immedi-

</p>
<p>ately to deliberate and make its determination. The provost
</p>
<p>marshal was required to have the prisoners present during the
</p>
<p>trial, and was held responsible for their safe keeping. Their
</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMISSION, AND TRIAL. 107
</p>
<p>counsel was permitted to hold communication with them in the
</p>
<p>presence, but not in the hearing, of the guard. Counsel for the
</p>
<p>prisoners were required to furnish immediately a list of witnesses
</p>
<p>required for the defense of their respective clients to the Judge
</p>
<p>Advocate General, who procured their attendance in the usual
</p>
<p>manner. At the meeting of the Commission on May the nth,
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd asked permission to introduce Frederick Stone,
</p>
<p>Esq., and Thomas Ewing, Jr., Esq., as his counsel. Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt asked to introduce Frederick Aiken, Esq., and John W.
</p>
<p>Clampitt, Esq., as her counsel, which applications were granted
</p>
<p>by the court. At its meeting on May I2th, David E. Herold
</p>
<p>asked to introduce Frederick Stone, Esq., as his counsel; Samuel
</p>
<p>Arnold asked to introduce Thomas Ewing, Jr., Esq., as his
</p>
<p>counsel; George A. Atzerodt asked to introduce William E.
</p>
<p>Doster, Esq., as his counsel ; Michael O'Laughlin applied for
</p>
<p>permission to introduce Walter S. Cox, Esq., as his counsel ;
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne asked to introduce William E. Doster, Esq., as his
</p>
<p>counsel ; Edward Spangler applied for permission to introduce
</p>
<p>Thomas Ewing, Jr., Esq., as his counsel ; which applications were
</p>
<p>granted, and Messrs. Doster and Cox, having first taken the oath
</p>
<p>prescribed by act of Congress approved July 2d, 1862, in open
</p>
<p>court, appeared accordingly. The accused, Mary E. Surratt,
</p>
<p>applied for permission to introduce Hon. Reverdy Johnson as
</p>
<p>additional counsel for her, and permission being granted, he ap-
</p>
<p>peared accordingly. The admission of Mr. Johnson was objected
</p>
<p>to by the author, a member of the court, on the ground that he
</p>
<p>had very light views of the obligations of an oath, and in proof of
</p>
<p>this, reference was made to an open letter to the people of Mary-
</p>
<p>land, written a few months previously by the honorable gentleman,
</p>
<p>in which he advised them to take the oath prescribed by the late
</p>
<p>Constitutional Convention of that State as a qualification for the
</p>
<p>exercise of the right of suffrage in the adoption or rejection of the
</p>
<p>amended Constitution, in which letter he took the ground that as
</p>
<p>the convention had transcended its power in prescribing such an

<p>oath, which in effect was intended to exclude all disloyal persons
</p>
<p>from participation in this right of citizenship, it carried in it no
</p>
<p>moral obligation ; and that they might therefore take it as a
</p>
<p>IO8 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>matter of indifference, even though they were disloyal. The hon-
</p>
<p>orable gentleman at first treated this objection to his appearance
</p>
<p>with great Jiauteur of manner, and appeared to be astonished that
</p>
<p>an obscure officer in the army, whom nobody knew, should pre-
</p>
<p>sume to arraign a man in his position as incompetent to appear
</p>
<p>before such a court. He was answered by the president of the
</p>
<p>Commission, who said, that had not General Harris raised this
</p>
<p>objection he had intended doing so himself. The honorable
</p>
<p>gentleman, seeing that there was danger of his exclusion from the
</p>
<p>court, and that it could not be bluffed, immediately came down
</p>
<p>from his high horse, and in a very respectful manner entered into
</p>
<p>a lengthy explanation of the letter referred to, which explanation
</p>
<p>did not put a better face on the matter, but as he in closing em-
</p>
<p>phatically declared that he did recognize the moral obligation of
</p>
<p>an oath, the objection was withdrawn, and he was admitted and
</p>
<p>appeared accordingly. The accused severally then asked, for the
</p>
<p>time, to withdraw their plea of " Not guilty," heretofore filed, so
</p>
<p>that they might plead to the jurisdiction of the court.
</p>
<p>This being granted, they offered the following plea to the juris-
</p>
<p>diction of the court :
</p>
<p>" , one of the accused, for plea says that this court
</p>
<p>has no jurisdiction in the proceedings against him, because he says
</p>
<p>he is not, and has not been, in the military service of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>"And for further plea, the said says that loyal civil
</p>
<p>courts, in which all the offenses charged are triable, exist,
</p>
<p>and are in full and free operation in all the places where the
</p>
<p>several offenses charged are alleged to have been committed.
</p>
<p>"And for further plea, the said says that the court has
</p>
<p>no jurisdiction in the matter of the alleged conspiracy, so far as it
</p>
<p>is charged to have been a conspiracy to murder Abraham Lincoln,
</p>
<p>late President of the United States, and William H. Seward, Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of State, because he says said alleged conspiracy, and all acts
</p>
<p>alleged to have been done in the formation and in the execution

</p>
<p>thereof, are in the charge and specifications alleged to have been
</p>
<p>committed in the City of Washington, in which city are loyal civil
</p>
<p>courts in full operation, in which all said offenses charged are
</p>
<p>triable.
</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMISSION, AND TRIAL. 109
</p>
<p>"And the said for further plea says this court has no
</p>
<p>jurisdiction in the matter of the crime of murdering Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, late President of the United States, and William H.
</p>
<p>Seward, Secretary of State, because he says said crimes and acts
</p>
<p>done in execution thereof are, in the charge and specifications,
</p>
<p>alleged to have been committed in the City of Washington, in
</p>
<p>which city are loyal civil courts, in full operation, in which said
</p>
<p>crimes are triable."
</p>
<p>In answer to this plea the judge advocate presented the follow-
</p>
<p>ing replication :
</p>
<p>" Now come the United States, and for answer to the special
</p>
<p>plea by one of the defendants, , plead to the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of the Commission in this case, say that this Commission has
</p>
<p>jurisdiction in the premises to try and determine the matters in
</p>
<p>the charge and specifications alleged and set forth against the
</p>
<p>said defendant, .
</p>
<p>"J. HOLT,
</p>
<p>" Judge Advocate General''
</p>
<p>The court was then cleared for deliberation, and on being re-
</p>
<p>opened the Judge Advocate announced that the pleas of the
</p>
<p>accused had been overruled by the Commission. The accused
</p>
<p>then made application for severance as follows :
</p>
<p>" , one of the accused, asks that he be tried separate
</p>
<p>from those who are charged with him, for the reason that he
</p>
<p>believes his defense will be greatly prejudiced by a joint trial."
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the application for severance. The
</p>
<p>accused then severally plead :
</p>
<p>To the specifications, " Not guilty."
</p>
<p>To the charge, " Not guilty."
</p>
<p>The considerations on which the motion for severance was over-
</p>
<p>ruled were, that the charge alleged a conspiracy on the part of
</p>
<p>the persons accused and on trial, with others unknown, unlawfully,
</p>
<p>maliciously, and traitorously to kill and murder the President and
</p>
<p>others. The fact of entering into a conspiracy to do unlawful acts

<p>gives to the associated body, in law, an individuality ; personality

<p>HO ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>is merged in the common purpose of those thus combining them-
</p>
<p>selves together, and so the declaration or act of any one of them,
</p>
<p>touching the accomplishment of the common purpose, becomes
</p>
<p>the declaration or act of all. The guilt is equally shared by all.
</p>
<p>If the government could not sustain the charge of a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>then none of the accused could be found guilty of entering into a
</p>
<p>conspiracy as alleged. The fact of a conspiracy being established,
</p>
<p>it only remained to be shown in each case that the accused was a
</p>
<p>member of it ; proving this, he would be held to be a sharer in
</p>
<p>the guilt, although not present at the commission of the crime ; but
</p>
<p>failing to establish the fact of his belonging to the conspiracy, his
</p>
<p>innocence must be legally admitted. In other words he could not
</p>
<p>be found guilty. There can in law be no severance of an individu-
</p>
<p>ality; and so the application for a separate trial was denied, or
</p>
<p>overruled.
</p>
<p>On the demurrer to the jurisdiction of the court, the Commis-
</p>
<p>sion held that it could not admit this to be a question that it could
</p>
<p>properly take under its consideration. To the executive depart-
</p>
<p>ment of the government alone belonged the decision of this ques-
</p>
<p>tion as to the kind of trial that the accused should have ; and the
</p>
<p>President, after maturely considering it in the light of the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution and the related facts, and after having submitted it to his
</p>
<p>Attorney General for his opinion, accepting that opinion as the cor-
</p>
<p>rect conclusion of his very exhaustive argument, embracing all
</p>
<p>the Constitutional questions involved, had determined that these
</p>
<p>parties were offenders against the laws of war, as their offense
</p>
<p>was the act of secret, active participants in the existing hostilities,
</p>
<p>and committed with a deep political intent, the purpose of which
</p>
<p>was to give aid to the existing rebellion, and so, justly, under the
</p>
<p>Constitution, subjecting them to law martial, and trial by a mili-
</p>
<p>tary commission. The President, being cx-ojficio Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief of the armies of the United States, had the right to order a
</p>
<p>detail of officers to constitute such court, and by order to specify
</p>
<p>the duties required of them. Their duty as officers of the army

</p>
<p>required of them simply obedience to the orders of the President
</p>
<p>of the United States and to those over them in the organization of
</p>
<p>the military arm of the government. To this they were bound by
</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMISSION, AND TRIAL. \ \ \
</p>
<p>the solemn obligations of their official oath. To have entertained
</p>
<p>this question would have been an act of disobedience, subjecting
</p>
<p>them to discipline ; to have refused to serve would have been an
</p>
<p>act of mutiny. The officers composing this court were, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the biographers of President Lincoln (Nicolay and Hay)
</p>
<p>" not only officers high in rank, but of unusual weight of charac-
</p>
<p>ter"; they had been thoroughly schooled in military discipline,
</p>
<p>and so recognized the duty of obedience to orders as the first duty
</p>
<p>of a soldier. It was not any part of their duty to discuss the wis-
</p>
<p>dom, propriety, or legality of an order before entering upon the
</p>
<p>act of obedience. Their duty was simply to obey, and for this
</p>
<p>they were properly held responsible. The order of detail assigned
</p>
<p>to them the specific duty of trying the accused under the charge
</p>
<p>and specifications prepared against them by the government, and
</p>
<p>so, as loyal, obedient soldiers, loving their country and having
</p>
<p>faith in its government, they had nothing to do but to enter upon
</p>
<p>and discharge the duties for which they had been detailed.
</p>
<p>As before stated, the Hon. Reverdy Johnson, a United States
</p>
<p>Senator from Maryland, volunteered to defend Mrs. Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt, selecting her for his client that he might have the benefit,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of his argument, of the sympathy which we all
</p>
<p>naturally feel for her sex. It was not his purpose to defend her
</p>
<p>any more than any other one or all of the prisoners, as he
</p>
<p>addressed himself simply to the task of arguing the question of
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. His real object was, evidently, to get himself before
</p>
<p>the Commission, that he might arraign the martyred President before
</p>
<p>the country and before the world, and denounce his acts for the
</p>
<p>prosecution of the war as unconstitutional and tyrannical usurpa-
</p>
<p>tions of power. He made a lengthy, and from the stand-point
</p>
<p>of the right of secession, able argument against the right to try
</p>
<p>these cases before a military tribunal. The Commission was made
</p>
<p>up largely of men sufficiently versed in constitutional law, as well
</p>
<p>as the laws of nations and of war, to be little influenced by his
</p>
<p>sophistries. Their position towards the government on these ques-

</p>
<p>tions had placed them where they were, as officers in its military
</p>
<p>service, and they could not be swerved from the loyal discharge of
</p>
<p>their duty. The reply of the Hon. John A. Bingham to the sophis-
</p>
<p>112 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>tries of the honorable senator, is a masterpiece of logical reason-
</p>
<p>ing, as also of forensic eloquence and legal acumen, and will well
</p>
<p>repay the careful study, not only of every student of law, but of
</p>
<p>every young man who has an ambition to become intelligent in
</p>
<p>matters of public interest, involving the rights, duties, and priv-
</p>
<p>ileges of the citizen in time of peace and in time of war.
</p>
<p>It will be found not only thoroughly learned and exhaustive of
</p>
<p>all questions involved, as a legal argument, but also the very
</p>
<p>embodiment of patriotic devotion to our free institutions of
</p>
<p>government, and to the cause of civil liberty, justice, humanity,
</p>
<p>and moral progress.
</p>
<p>The Commission was diligently engaged in the trial of the
</p>
<p>prisoners from the iith day of May until the 3Oth day of June,
</p>
<p>a period of about seven weeks being consumed in hearing the testi-
</p>
<p>mony and the motions and arguments of counsel. As I have
</p>
<p>given, in narrative form, the facts proven against each of the
</p>
<p>accused, as they stood unimpeached and uncontroverted by testi-
</p>
<p>mony given in defense, in giving the history of their arrest, it is
</p>
<p>unnecessary that I should give it formally, as it appears upon the
</p>
<p>record of the trial.
</p>
<p>After maturely deliberating on the evidence adduced in the case
</p>
<p>of each of the accused, the findings of the Commission were as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>In the case of David E. Herold : Of the specification guilty ;
</p>
<p>except " combining, confederating, and conspiring with Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler," as to which part thereof not guilty. Of the charge
</p>
<p>guilty; except the words of the charge, "combining, confederat-
</p>
<p>ing, and conspiring with Edward Spangler," as to which not guilty.
</p>
<p>And the Commission did, therefore, sentence him, the said David
</p>
<p>E. Herold, to be hanged by the neck until he be dead, at such time
</p>
<p>and place as the President of the United States should direct, two-
</p>
<p>thirds of the Commission concurring therein.
</p>
<p>In the case of George A. Atzerodt: After mature considera-

</p>
<p>tion of the evidence adduced, the Commission found the accused,
</p>
<p>of the specification guilty; except " combining, confederating, and
</p>
<p>conspiring with Edward Spangler," of this not guilty. Of the
</p>
<p>charge guilty; except "combining, confederating, and conspiring
</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMISSION, AND TRIAL. 113
</p>
<p>with Edward Spangler," of this not guilty. And the sentence of
</p>
<p>the Commission was that he be hanged by the neck until he be
</p>
<p>dead, at such time and place as the President of the United States
</p>
<p>might direct, two-thirds of the Commission concurring therein.
</p>
<p>In the case of Lewis Payne, the Commission found him, of the
</p>
<p>specifications guilty; of the charge guilty; with the same excep-
</p>
<p>tions as in the case of Atzerodt ; and sentenced him to be hung as
</p>
<p>above, two-thirds of the Commission concurring therein.
</p>
<p>In the case of Mary E. Surratt, the Commission found her, of
</p>
<p>the specifications guilty, and of the charge guilty ; except as to
</p>
<p>"receiving, sustaining, harboring, and concealing Samuel Arnold
</p>
<p>and Michael O'Laughlin " ; and except as to " combining, con-
</p>
<p>federating, and conspiring with Edward Spangler," and of this not
</p>
<p>guilty ; and sentenced her to be hanged by the neck until she be
</p>
<p>dead, at such time 'and place as the President of the United States
</p>
<p>should direct, two-thirds of the Commission concurring therein.
</p>
<p>In the case of Michael O'Laughlin, the Commission found him
</p>
<p>guilty of the specifications, except the words thereof, " And in
</p>
<p>further prosecution of the conspiracy aforesaid, and of its
</p>
<p>murderous and treasonable purposes aforesaid, on the night of the
</p>
<p>1 3th of April, A.D. 1865, at Washington City, and within the mili-
</p>
<p>tary department and military lines aforesaid, the said Michael
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin did, then and there, lie in wait for Ulysses S. Grant,
</p>
<p>then Lieutenant General and commander of the armies of the
</p>
<p>United States, with intent, then and there, to kill and murder the
</p>
<p>said Ulysses S. Grant " ; of said words not guilty. Of the charge
</p>
<p>guilty, except " combining, confederating, and conspiring with
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler"; of this not guilty. O'Laughlin was sentenced
</p>
<p>by the Commission to be imprisoned at hard labor for life, at such
</p>
<p>place as the President might direct, two-thirds of the Commission
</p>
<p>concurring therein. In the case of Edward Spangler, the Com-
</p>
<p>mission found him guilty of the charge and specifications, with
</p>
<p>exceptions similar to the above, and sentenced him to be
</p>
<p>imprisoned at hard labor for the term of six years, at such place

</p>
<p>as the President might direct, two-thirds concurring therein.
</p>
<p>In the case of Samuel Arnold, the decision of the Commission
</p>
<p>was, that he was guilty of the charge and specifications, with
</p>
<p>114 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>exceptions similar to the above, and that he should be imprisoned
</p>
<p>for life at hard labor at such place as the President should direct,
</p>
<p>two-thirds concurring.
</p>
<p>In the case of Samuel A. Mudd, the Commission found him
</p>
<p>guilty of the charge and specifications, with similar exceptions, as
</p>
<p>the evidence required, and sentenced him to be imprisoned at
</p>
<p>hard labor for life, as above.
</p>
<p>The findings and sentences of the Commission were approved by
</p>
<p>the President, and those of the accused who were sentenced to im-
</p>
<p>prisonment at hard labor were ordered by him to be sent to the
</p>
<p>military prison at the Dry Tortugas, and they were transported
</p>
<p>there accordingly.
</p>
<p>In the case of those who were sentenced to death, the President
</p>
<p>ordered their execution to take place on the /th day of July, one
</p>
<p>week after they were convicted and sentenced by the court, and
</p>
<p>they were accordingly executed.
</p>
<p>After the conviction and sentence of Mrs. Surratt, Judge
</p>
<p>Bingham, at the request of a member of the court, drew up the
</p>
<p>following petition: "To the President: The undersigned, members
</p>
<p>of the military commission appointed to try the persons charged
</p>
<p>with the murder of Abraham Lincoln, etc., respectfully represent
</p>
<p>that the Commission have been constrained to find Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt guilty upon the testimony of the assassination of Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, late President of the United States, and to pronounce
</p>
<p>upon her, as required by law, the sentence of death ; but in con-
</p>

<p>writ of habeas corptis has been heretofore suspended in such cases as this, and I do
</p>
<p>hereby especially suspend this writ, and direct that you proceed to execute the order
</p>
<p>heretofore given upon the judgment of the military commission, and you will give this
</p>
<p>order in return to the writ.
</p>
<p>ANDREW JOHNSON, President.
</p>
<p>I 1 6 ASSASSINA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>The court ruled that it yielded to the suspension of the writ of
</p>
<p>habeas corpus by the President of the United States.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the contest over the jurisdiction of the military
</p>
<p>commission. It has never been revived with success and never
</p>
<p>will be, as the sound sense of every patriotic American, whose
</p>
<p>heart beats true to the cause of liberty, justice, good morals, and
</p>
<p>good government, rests on the arguments that determined this
</p>
<p>trial by a military commission as its sanction, both by our inimita-
</p>
<p>ble Constitution and by the laws of war. In the light of these
</p>
<p>arguments, this trial will ever hereafter have the authority of a
</p>
<p>precedent, should another crisis arise involving the principles on
</p>
<p>which it rests. It was only those whose sympathies were with the
</p>
<p>rebellion who demurred to it at the time, and whose yelp is
</p>
<p>occasionally heard, even at this late day, but on a very cold trail.
</p>
<p>The sentence of the Commission was executed on the /th day of
</p>
<p>July, 1865, in accordance with the President's order, by General
</p>
<p>Hancock, in the yard of the old Capitol prison. Thus the trial
</p>
<p>and the execution were alike at the hands of the military; and
</p>
<p>thus the authority and justice of the government were vindicated,
</p>
<p>and a solemn warning was given to all traitors to desist from
</p>
<p>schemes of assassination ; a warning which, as we shall yet see,
</p>
<p>taught them a salutary lesson, and in some measure brought them
</p>
<p>to their senses.
</p>
<p>We shall now turn our attention to the persons just now referred
</p>
<p>to, some of whom were known, but many were unknown. Before
</p>
<p>doing this, however, it seems due to our history at this point to
</p>
<p>say a word about Booth's co-conspirator, John H. Surratt, who
</p>
<p>would seem to have dropped out of sight in the narrative I have
</p>
<p>given of the arrest and trial of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that he carried the dispatches from the
</p>
<p>Richmond government to the Canada conspirators, sanctioning the
</p>
<p>arrangements that had been made by them to secure the assassi-
</p>
<p>nations they had planned ; that he arrived with these dispatches at
</p>
<p>Montreal on the 6th of April; and that the execution of the

</p>
<p>plot was at once entered upon, those of the conspirators who
</p>
<p>were to take an active part preparing immediately and starting for
</p>
<p>Washington, boasting openly of what they would do when they
</p>
<p>CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMISSION, AND TRIAL. \\-j
</p>
<p>should have reached their destination. Some of these were known,
</p>
<p>and will be hereafter referred to by name ; but there would seem
</p>
<p>to have been a number of them whose names were never learned.
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt came back, either alone or in company with some
</p>
<p>of them. That he was in Washington, aiding and abetting, on the
</p>
<p>day and night of the assassination, was positively sworn to by one
</p>
<p>of the witnesses who was well acquainted with him ; and from the
</p>
<p>concurrence of testimony, there is good reason to believe that he
</p>
<p>was one of the two parties with whom Booth was in communica-
</p>
<p>tion on the sidewalk in front of the theatre, as heretofore narrated,
</p>
<p>and that he acted as monitor, calling the time for Booth. He
</p>
<p>seems, however, to have had the bumps both of cautiousness and
</p>
<p>secretiveness largely developed, and so kept himself as much as
</p>
<p>possible out of sight in the transaction in which he was no doubt,
</p>
<p>at the same time, an active participant. He most probably left
</p>
<p>Washington on the first train after the work was done, as we have
</p>
<p>no trace of him again until we find him at Burlington, Vt., on
</p>
<p>his way to Canada, on the i8th of April. As it is my purpose to
</p>
<p>devote a chapter or two to his case especially, I shall not, at this
</p>
<p>time, pursue it any further; but as he was undoubtedly a very
</p>
<p>active and important factor in the conspiracy, and escaped justice
</p>
<p>merely by escaping capture at the time, and so securing a civil
</p>
<p>trial after the war was over, a history of his case naturally comes
</p>
<p>within the scope of my plan, and will serve to illustrate what I have
</p>
<p>already said in relation to the existing facts in regard to the pop-
</p>
<p>ulation of the District of Columbia that would have rendered a

<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE IN REGARD TO ATROCITIES NOT EMBRACED IN THE
</p>
<p>CHARGE AND SPECIFICATIONS, FOR WHICH DAVIS AND HIS
</p>
<p>CANADA CABINET WERE RESPONSIBLE.
</p>
<p>IT will have been noticed that in its charge and specifications
</p>
<p>against the prisoners on trial the government charged Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, George N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson,
</p>
<p>William C. Cleary, Clement C. Clay, George Harper, George
</p>
<p>Young, and others unknown, with combining, confederating, and
</p>
<p>conspiring together with one John H. Surratt and John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson,
</p>
<p>William H. Seward, and Ulysses S. Grant; and in the specifica-
</p>
<p>tions it is alleged that David E. Herold, Edward Spangler, Lewis
</p>
<p>Payne, Michael O'Laughlin, Samuel Arnold, Mary E. Surratt,
</p>
<p>George Atzerodt, and Samuel A. Mudd, together with the said
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt and John Wilkes Booth, incited and encouraged
</p>
<p>thereunto by Jefferson Davis, George N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker,
</p>
<p>Jacob Thompson, William C. Cleary, Clement C. Clay, George
</p>
<p>Harper, George Young, and others unknown, did kill and murder
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, and assault violently with intent to kill William
</p>
<p>H. Seward. In this the government distinctly and unequivocally
</p>
<p>charged Jefferson Davis and his allies with inciting and encourag-
</p>
<p>ing the prisoners on trial to the commission of this great crime,
</p>
<p>with the political intent of giving aid to their sinking cause. They
</p>
<p>were not arraigned before the Commission, for they were not in
</p>
<p>custody ; but they were arraigned before the world. The Com-
</p>
<p>mission was then not called upon to render a finding in their case ;
</p>
<p>but the government was called upon to present to the world through
</p>
<p>the Commission the evidence on which its grave charge against

</p>
<p>these men, who had rendered themselves conspicuous before the
</p>
<p>world, was founded. Its honor and dignity made this obligatory
</p>
<p>upon it. A careful reading of the charge and specifications on
</p>
<p>which the assassins were arraigned and tried will show that it was
</p>
<p>competent for the government to present, on that trial, the evi-
</p>
<p>dence in its possession on which it charged Jefferson Davis, Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson, Clement C. Clay, Beverly Tucker, George N. Sanders,
</p>
<p>William C. Cleary, George Young, George Harper, and others, as
</p>
<p>being inciters to this crime. This evidence was so conclusive of
</p>
<p>their guilt as charged, that had they been before the Commission
</p>
<p>they could only have escaped conviction by impeaching the govern-
</p>
<p>ment's witnesses.
</p>
<p>Before entering upon the consideration of the evidence a few
</p>
<p>prefatory remarks seem to be necessary. At an early period of
</p>
<p>the rebellion Jefferson Davis and his cabinet felt the necessity of
</p>
<p>sending some of the strongest men of the Confederacy to establish
</p>
<p>their headquarters in Canada, to look after the interests of the
</p>
<p>rebel cause, both at home and abroad, and to render assistance to
</p>
<p>that cause in everyway that they could. Amongst its agents thus
</p>
<p>sent to Canada we find Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, who had
</p>
<p>been Secretary of the Interior during Buchanan's administration ;
</p>
<p>Clement C. Clay, who had been a United States Senator from Ala-
</p>
<p>bama ; Beverly Tucker, who had been a circuit judge in Virginia ;
</p>
<p>George N. Sanders, William C. Cleary, George Young, George
</p>
<p>Harper, and others of less note, acting in subordinate capacities
</p>
<p>under the above conspicuous leaders and agents.
</p>
<p>These agents had been domiciled within the territory of a
</p>
<p>neutral government to carry on belligerent operations, contrary to
</p>
<p>the laws of nations and also of war ; and the operations planned
</p>
<p>by them from time to time, and sometimes executed, were of the
</p>
<p>highest moral turpitude. The fact that, although the government
</p>
<p>of Canada held the position of a neutral power as between the
</p>
<p>belligerents, yet its people, in the proportion of five to one,
</p>
<p>sympathized with the rebellion, made it very favorable to the

<p>their purposes. They were within easy and constant communica-

</p>
<p>tion with the enemies of the government that were to be found in
</p>
<p>every Northern State, and at the same time were able to afford a
</p>
<p>place of refuge for rebel prisoners who were able to find means of
</p>
<p>escape from Northern prisons. Canada was a place where dis-
</p>
<p>loyal refugees and persons accused of offenses against the govern-
</p>
<p>ment congregated all through the war ; and so Jefferson Davis's
</p>
<p>Canada Cabinet was never at a loss for material for carrying out
</p>
<p>its plans without regard to their character. They were constantly
</p>
<p>surrounded by desperate and reckless men, who were in deep
</p>
<p>sympathy with them in their desperate purpose to overthrow the
</p>
<p>government, and like them, ready to engage in anything that
</p>
<p>might give aid in carrying out that purpose. From the head of
</p>
<p>the rebel government on down through the ranks of this class' of
</p>
<p>its agents, there appears to have been no restraint from any moral
</p>
<p>consideration. The honorable men of the Confederacy were found,
</p>
<p>to a large extent, in the ranks of its soldiers engaged in open war-
</p>
<p>fare, he assassination plot was the last card of these desperate
</p>
<p>men ; it was preceded by many others in which the laws of war
</p>
<p>and the laws of morals were utterly ignored. We will, therefore,
</p>
<p>in the first place, present some of the most flagrant of these, in
</p>
<p>regard to which the evidence makes Jefferson Davis and his
</p>
<p>Canada Cabinet responsible, in order that from these revelations
</p>
<p>we may be thoroughly informed of their utter disregard of every
</p>
<p>moral consideration, and that we may thus be prepared for the
</p>
<p>conclusions to which the evidence of their complicity in, and
</p>
<p>responsibility for, the assassination plot point.
</p>
<p>To show the utter lack of moral appreciation, the entire disre-
</p>
<p>gard of all moral requirements, and contempt for the enlightened
</p>
<p>Christian sentiment of the world as embodied in the accepted
</p>
<p>codes of martial and international law, and that the assassination
</p>
<p>plot was only in keeping with their other schemes to aid the rebel
</p>
<p>cause, I deem it necessary to dwell at some length on the state-
</p>
<p>ment of these schemes, as shown by the testimony before the
</p>
<p>Commission. The St. Albans raid, under the lead of Lieutenant

<p>Bennett H. Young (made a lieutenant for this occasion only, and

</p>
<p>ferred by him, at his discretion, on the persons he engaged in such
</p>
<p>expeditions, as a protection in case of a trial for extradition), was
</p>
<p>simply a hostile expedition planned by these conspirators, who
</p>
<p>organized a squad of about twenty escaped Confederate soldiers
</p>
<p>from the prisons in which they had been confined, and placed them
</p>
<p>under command of Young, armed with one of these commissions
</p>
<p>for his protection. This bogus lieutenant was instructed to pass
</p>
<p>through the New England States with his command, and escape
</p>
<p>by the way of Halifax, burning towns and farm-houses as he went ;
</p>
<p>and by robbing and plundering to secure all the money he could,
</p>
<p>and whatever else he could convert to the use of the Confederate
</p>
<p>government. He made a foray into Vermont; set fire to the
</p>
<p>town of St. Albans ; robbed two banks, securing about two hun-
</p>
<p>dred thousand dollars; and then, finding himself confronted by
</p>
<p>such opposition that he was unable to proceed, was compelled to
</p>
<p>retreat into Canada, being so closely pursued that he and a good
</p>
<p>part of his command were made prisoners. They were com-
</p>
<p>mitted to jail to await a trial for extradition.
</p>
<p>This was simply a guerilla raid, organized on neutral territory,
</p>
<p>not for the purpose of engaging in open and honorable warfare
</p>
<p>against an armed foe," but to burn and plunder the property of
</p>
<p>unarmed people, who were non-combatants engaged in the pur-
</p>
<p>suits of peaceful life. Young's commission, however, enabled him
</p>
<p>to defeat the demand for his extradition, as he was not captured
</p>
<p>until he had regained that neutral territory on which, in violation
</p>
<p>of the law of nations, his expedition had been organized. It is
</p>
<p>easy to see from this where the sympathies of the Canadian court
</p>
<p>that tried this case lay. Pending this trial for extradition, Clay
</p>
<p>became very uneasy for fear the commission conferred by him on
</p>
<p>Young might not prove a sufficient protection, and so he sent
</p>
<p>Richard Montgomery, who was in the employ of the United
</p>
<p>States in its department of secret service, and who had so well
</p>
<p>wormed himself into the confidence of the Canada Cabinet as to
</p>
<p>be employed by them on this mission, with a letter to James A.

<p>Seddon, the rebel secretary of war, urging him by every consider-
</p>
<p>ation he could think of to give a direct sanction to Young's act,
</p>
<p>and to demand in the name of the Confederate government that
</p>
<p>he should be released.

<p>122 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>This letter was carried to Richmond by Montgomery, after hav-
</p>
<p>ing been exhibited to the Secretary of War of the United States.
</p>
<p>I refer to this as showing the status of Montgomery with these agents
</p>
<p>of the Confederate government in Canada, and as evidence of his
</p>
<p>having gained their entire confidence ; and so he was in a position to
</p>
<p>be a witness, before the Commission, as being informed of their plans
</p>
<p>and of their doings. In response to this argument and earnest
</p>
<p>appeal of Clay, the rebel government shouldered the responsibility
</p>
<p>of the St. Albans raid, and shielded the raiders against extradition.
</p>
<p>The following is a copy of Lieutenaut Young's instructions from
</p>
<p>the rebel government :
</p>
<p>CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA,
</p>
<p>WAR DEPARTMENT,
</p>
<p>RICHMOND, VA., June i6th, 1864.
</p>
<p>To Lieutenant BENNETT H. YOUNG:
</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT : You have been temporarily appointed first lieutenant in the provi-
</p>
<p>sional army for special service. You will proceed without delay to the British Prov-
</p>
<p>inces, where you will report to Messrs. Thompson and Clay for instructions.
</p>
<p>You will, under their direction, collect together such Confederate soldiers who have
</p>
<p>escaped from the enemy, not exceeding twenty in number, as you may deem suitable
</p>
<p>for the purpose, and will execute such enterprises as may be entrusted to you.
</p>
<p>You will take care to commit no violation of the local law, and to obey implicitly
</p>
<p>their instructions.
</p>
<p>You and your men will receive from these gentlemen transportation and the custom-
</p>
<p>ary rations and clothing, or commutation therefor.

<p>JAMES A. SEDDON,

</p>
<p>Here we have the response to Clay's letter, and everything fixed
</p>
<p>up for the defense of Young and his men after the act had been
</p>
<p>committed, the papers being antedated to meet the requirements
</p>
<p>of the case.
</p>
<p>During the progress of this trial for the extradition of the
</p>
<p>raiders, Thompson, Clay, Tucker, and Sanders necessarily held
</p>
<p>a kind of professional intercourse with the counsel representing

<p>the United States. Sanders, on one occasion, became full of
</p>
<p>self-importance, as also, probably, of whiskey, when his discretion
</p>
<p>forsook him, and he gave vent to the vaunting and boasting of a
</p>
<p>braggadocio. He said this raid was not the last that would occur,
</p>
<p>but it would be followed by the depleting of many other banks
</p>
<p>and the burning of other towns on the frontier, and that many

<p>Yankee sons of (using a coarse and vulgar expression) would
</p>
<p>be killed. He said they had their plans perfectly organized, and
</p>
<p>men ready to sack and burn Buffalo, Detroit, New York, and other
</p>
<p>places, and had deferred them for a time, but would soon see the
</p>
<p>plans wholly executed ; and any preparations that could be made
</p>
<p>by the government to prevent them, would not, though they might
</p>
<p>delay them for a time. He claimed to be acting as the agent of
</p>
<p>the Confederate government, and we have seen that it assumed
</p>
<p>the responsibility. Several other raids of like character were
</p>
<p>planned, but were prevented by preparations which the govern-
</p>
<p>ment was enabled to make by being informed of them in advance
</p>
<p>by persons engaged in its secret service, or by other friends in
</p>
<p>Canada, who, being in the confidence of the conspirators, became
</p>
<p>informed as to their plans.
</p>
<p>These plans involved a warfare against non-combatants ; a war,
</p>
<p>as we shall see, of poisoning reservoirs, of burning towns and cities
</p>
<p>by wholesale ; a war of the destruction of men, women, and chil-
</p>
<p>dren ; burning of hospitals, churches, and private dwellings ; a war
</p>
<p>for the destruction of life and property; in short, a war against
</p>
<p>humanity. The City of New York came in for a large share of
</p>
<p>their consideration. The destruction of the Croton dam was an
</p>
<p>enterprise that seemed very desirable to them, and for which they
</p>
<p>planned ; and had the rebel armies been able to keep the field a
</p>
<p>little while longer, this would no doubt have been attempted and
</p>
<p>perhaps accomplished. The poisoning of the reservoirs supply-
</p>
<p>ing the city with water seemed very desirable to them, and was
</p>
<p>much discussed. This was one of the hobbies of the infamous
</p>
<p>Dr. Blackburn and a Mr. M. A. Fallen of Mississippi, who had
</p>
<p>been a surgeon in the rebel army. They had made a calculation
</p>
<p>of the capacity of the reservoirs supplying the city, and had calcu-
</p>
<p>lated the amount of poison required to make an ordinary draught
</p>
<p>of water fatal to life. Amongst the poisons they had considered
</p>
<p>arsenic, strychnine, and prussic acid as available. Blackburn
</p>
<p>thought the project feasible. Thompson feared it would be

<p>impossible to collect so large a quantity of poisonous matter

<p>without exciting suspicion and leading to the detection of the
</p>
<p>parties engaged in it. Fallen and others thought it could be

<p>ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>managed in Europe. This matter was fully and freely discussed in
</p>
<p>June, 1864, by Blackburn, Fallen, Thompson, Sanders, and Cleary.
</p>
<p>The moral question involved in the destruction, by poison, of
</p>
<p>the entire population of the American commercial metropolis,
</p>
<p>men, women, and children, did not enter into their thoughts; it
</p>
<p>was, in fact, a scheme dear to their hearts ; the difficulties attend-
</p>
<p>ing its accomplishment were the only things that gave them any
</p>
<p>trouble.
</p>
<p>This is that same Dr. Blackburn who, with the approbation of
</p>
<p>Thompson and his gang, made an effort in the summer of 1864
</p>
<p>to spread pestilence in Washington City, and in other cities occu-
</p>
<p>pied by federal troops, as far south as could be reached, by
</p>
<p>means of clothing infected with yellow fever and with small-pox.
</p>
<p>Conover testified to this positively and circumstantially as one
</p>
<p>of their many wicked schemes to spread consternation over the
</p>
<p>North, and so demoralize the people that they would be willing
</p>
<p>to make peace on any terms.
</p>
<p>As this last scheme is so monstrous in character that it can
</p>
<p>only be believed on the fullest proof, I give the testimony of
</p>
<p>Godfrey Joseph Hyams before the Commission, in full.
</p>
<p>" I am a native of London, Eng., but have lived south nine or
</p>
<p>ten years. During the past year I have resided in Toronto, Can.
</p>
<p>About the middle of December, 1863, I made the acquaintance
</p>
<p>of Dr. Blackburn. I was introduced to him by the Rev. Stewart
</p>
<p>Robinson at the Queen's Hotel in Toronto. I knew him by sight
</p>
<p>previously, but before that had no conversation with him. I
</p>
<p>knew that he was a Confederate and was working for the rebellion.
</p>
<p>Dr. Blackburn was then about to take south some men who had
</p>
<p>escaped from the federal service, and I asked to go with him.
</p>
<p>He asked me if I wanted to go south and serve the Confederacy.
</p>
<p>I said I did. He then told me to come upstairs to a private
</p>
<p>room, as he wanted to speak to me. He took me upstairs, and
</p>
<p>after we had entered his room he pledged his word as a free-
</p>
<p>mason, and offered his hand in friendship, that he would never

</p>
<p>deceive me. He said he wanted to confide to me an expedition.
</p>
<p>I told him I would not care if I did. He said I would make an
</p>
<p>independent fortune by it, at least one hundred thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>ATROCITIES NOT EMBRACED IN THE CHARGE. 125
</p>
<p>and get more honor and glory to my name than General Lee, and
</p>
<p>be of more assistance to the Confederate government than if I was
</p>
<p>to take one hundred thousand soldiers to reinforce General Lee.
</p>
<p>I pledged my word that I would go if I could do any good. He
</p>
<p>then told me he wanted me to take a certain quantity of clothing,
</p>
<p>consisting of shirts, coats, and underclothing, into the States, and
</p>
<p>dispose of them by auction. I was to take them to Washington
</p>
<p>City, to Norfolk, and as far south as I could possibly go, where
</p>
<p>the federal government held possession and had the most troops,
</p>
<p>and to sell them on a hot day or of a night; that it did not
</p>
<p>matter what money I got for the clothing, I had just to dispose of
</p>
<p>them in the best market where there were the most troops, and
</p>
<p>where they would be most effective, and then come away. He
</p>
<p>told me I should have one hundred thousand dollars for my ser-
</p>
<p>vices, sixty thousand dollars of it directly after I returned to
</p>
<p>Toronto ; but he said that would not be a circumstance to what I
</p>
<p>should get. He said I might make ten times one hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand dollars. I was to stay in Toronto, and go on with my
</p>
<p>legitimate business until I heard from him. He told me to keep
</p>
<p>quiet, and if I moved anywhere I was to inform Dr. Stewart
</p>
<p>Robinson where I went to, and he would telegraph for me, or
</p>
<p>write to me through him. Sometime in the month of May, 1864,
</p>
<p>I went to my work and worked on until the 8th day of June, '64 ;
</p>
<p>it was on a Saturday night ; I had been out to take a pair of boots
</p>
<p>home to a customer of mine ; when I returned home my wife had
</p>
<p>a letter for me from Dr. Blackburn, which Dr. Stewart Robinson
</p>
<p>had left in passing there. I read the letter, and went out to see
</p>
<p>Dr. Robinson. I asked him what I was to do about it. He said
</p>
<p>he did not know anything about it ; that he did not want to
</p>
<p>furnish any means to commit an overt act against the United
</p>
<p>States government. He advised me to borrow from Mr. Preston,
</p>
<p>who keeps a tobacco manufactory in Toronto, enough money to
</p>
<p>take me to Montreal, and there get money from Mr. Slaughter,
</p>
<p>according to the directions contained in Dr. Blackburn's letter.

<p>This letter instructed me to proceed from Montreal to Halifax to
</p>
<p>meet Dr. Blackburn; it was dated Havana, May loth, 1864. I
</p>
<p>went to Halifax to a gentleman by the name of Alexander H.
</p>
<p>126 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Keith, Jr., and remained under his care until Dr. Blackburn
</p>
<p>arrived in the steamer 'Alpha,' on the I2th of July, 1864.
</p>
<p>When Dr. Blackburn arrived he sent to the Farmer's Hotel, where
</p>
<p>I was staying, for me. I went to see him, and he told me that
</p>
<p>the goods were on board the steamer 'Alpha,' and that the
</p>
<p>second officer on the steamer would go with me and get the goods
</p>
<p>off, as they had been smuggled in from Bermuda. Mr. Hill, the
</p>
<p>second officer, told me to get an express wagon and take it down
</p>
<p>to Cunard's steamboat .wharf. I did so, and there got eight
</p>
<p>trunks and a valise. I was directed to take them to my hotel,
</p>
<p>and put them in a private room. I put them in Mr. Doran's
</p>
<p>private sitting-room. I then went around to Dr. Blackburn, and
</p>
<p>told him I had got the goods off the steamer. He told me that
</p>
<p>the five trunks tied up with ropes were the ones for me to take,
</p>
<p>and asked me if I would take the valise into the States and send it
</p>
<p>by express, with an accompanying letter, as a donation to Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Lincoln. I objected to taking it, and refused to do so. I
</p>
<p>then took three of the trunks and the valise around to the hotel.
</p>
<p>He was then staying at the Halifax Hotel. The trunks had
</p>
<p>Spanish marks upon them, and he told me to scrape them off, and
</p>
<p>that Mr. Hill would go with me the next morning and make
</p>
<p>arrangements with some captain of a vessel to take them. There
</p>
<p>were two vessels there running to Boston, and I was to make an
</p>
<p>arrangement with either of them to smuggle the trunks through
</p>
<p>to Boston. The next morning I went down with Mr. Hill to the
</p>
<p>vessels. Mr. Hill had a private conversation with Captain
</p>
<p>McGregor, the captain of the first vessel, to whom we applied to
</p>
<p>take the goods, and he refused.
</p>
<p>" We then went to see Captain O'Brien of the bark ' Halifax.'
</p>
<p>Hill told him that I had some presents in my trunks, consisting
</p>
<p>of silks, satin dresses, etc., that I wanted to take to my friends. The
</p>
<p>Captain and Mr. Hill had a private conversation, and when the
</p>
<p>Captain came out he consented to take them. I was to give him
</p>
<p>a twenty-dollar gold piece for smuggling them in. I put them on

</p>
<p>board the vessel that day and he stowed them away. The vessel
</p>
<p>lay five days at Boston before he could get a chance to get them
</p>
<p>off, but finally he succeeded in getting them off, and expressed
</p>
<p>127
</p>
<p>them to Philadelphia, where I received them and brought them to
</p>
<p>Baltimore. I then took out the goods, which were very much
</p>
<p>rumpled, and smoothed them out and arranged them, bought some
</p>
<p>new trunks, and repacked them and brought them to this city.
</p>
<p>Dr. Blackburn, by way of caution, asked me before leaving if I
</p>
<p>had had the yellow fever, and on my saying ' no,' he said, 'You must
</p>
<p>have a preventive against taking it. You must get some camphor
</p>
<p>and chew it, and get some strong cigars, the strongest you can
</p>
<p>get; and be sure to keep gloves on your hands when handling
</p>
<p>the things.' He gave me some cigars that he said he had brought
</p>
<p>from Havana, which he said were strong enough for anything.
</p>
<p>When I arrived in this city, I turned over five of the trunks to
</p>
<p>Messrs. W. L. Wall & Company, commission merchants in this
</p>
<p>city, and four to a man by the name of Myers, from Boston, a
</p>
<p>sutler for Siegel's or Weitzel's division. He said he had some
</p>
<p>goods which he was going to take to New Berne, N.C., and
</p>
<p>I told him that I had a lot of goods that I wanted to sell, and,
</p>
<p>to make the best market I could for them, I would turn them over
</p>
<p>to him on commission. I also told him I would shortly have
</p>
<p>more, and mentioned that I had disposed of some to Wall &
</p>
<p>Company, of this city. Dr. Blackburn told me, when I was mak-
</p>
<p>ing arrangements, that I should let the parties to whom I dis-
</p>
<p>posed of my goods know that I would have a big lot to sell, as
</p>
<p>it was in contemplation to get together about a million dollars'
</p>
<p>worth of goods and dispose of them in that way. Dr. Blackburn
</p>
<p>stated that his object in having these goods disposed of in different
</p>
<p>cities was to destroy the armies, or anybody that they came in
</p>
<p>contact with. All these goods, he told me, had been carefully
</p>
<p>infected in Bermuda with yellow fever, small-pox, and other con-
</p>
<p>tagious diseases.
</p>
<p>" The goods in the valise, which were intended for President
</p>
<p>Lincoln, I understood him to say had been infected with yellow
</p>
<p>fever and small-pox. This valise I declined taking charge of and
</p>
<p>turned it over to him at Halifax Hotel, and I afterwards heard

</p>
<p>that it had been sent to the President. On the five trunks that I
</p>
<p>turned over to Wall & Company I got an advance of one hundred
</p>
<p>dollars. Among these five trunks there was one that was always
</p>
<p>128 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>spoken of by Blackburn to me as 'Big No. 2,' which he said I
</p>
<p>must be sure to have sold in Washington. On disposing of the
</p>
<p>trunks I immediately left Washington, and went straight through
</p>
<p>until I got to Hamilton, Canada. In the waiting-room there I
</p>
<p>met Mr. Holcomb and Clement C. Clay. They both rose, shook
</p>
<p>hands with me, and congratulated me upon my safe return, and
</p>
<p>upon my making a fortune. They told me I should be a gentleman
</p>
<p>for the future, instead of a working man and a mechanic. They
</p>
<p>seemed perfectly to understand the business in which I had been
</p>
<p>engaged.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Holcomb told me that Dr. Blackburn was at the Donegan
</p>
<p>Hotel, in Montreal, and that I had better telegraph to him stating
</p>
<p>that I had returned. As Dr. Blackburn had requested me to tele-
</p>
<p>graph to him as soon as I got into Canada, I did so, and the next
</p>
<p>night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Dr. Blackburn came up
</p>
<p>and knocked at the door of my house. I was in bed at the time.
</p>
<p>I looked out of the window, and saw Dr. Blackburn there. Said
</p>
<p>he, ' Come down, Hyams, and open the door ; you are like all
</p>
<p>damned rascals who have been doing something wrong you're
</p>
<p>afraid that the devil is after you.' He was in company with Ben-
</p>
<p>nett H. Young. I came down and let him in. He asked me how
</p>
<p>I had disposed of the go.ods and I told him. ' Well/ said he ' that
</p>
<p>is all right as long as "Big No. 2 " went into Washington; it will
</p>
<p>kill them at sixty yards distance.' I then told the doctor that
</p>
<p>everything had gone wrong at my home in my absence ; that I
</p>
<p>needed some funds ; that my family needed money. He said he
</p>
<p>would go to Colonel Jacob Thompson and make arrangements for
</p>
<p>me to draw upon him for any amount of money that I required.
</p>
<p>He then said that the British authorities had solicited his services in
</p>
<p>attending the yellow fever that was then raging in Bermuda ; that
</p>
<p>he was going on there ; and that as soon as he came back he
</p>
<p>would see me. I went up to Jacob Thompson the next morning,
</p>
<p>and told him what Dr. Blackburn had said. He said ' Yes ' ; Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn had been there and had made arrangements for me to

<p>draw one hundred dollars whenever it was shown that I had made
</p>
<p>disposition of the goods according to his directions. I told him
</p>
<p>I needed money ; that I had been so long away from home that

</p>
<p>everything I had was gone, and I wanted money to pay my rent,
</p>
<p>etc. He said, ' I will give you fifty dollars now, but it is against
</p>
<p>Dr. Blackburn's request; when you show me that you have sold
</p>
<p>the goods, I will give you the balance.' He asked me to give him
</p>
<p>a receipt, which I did : ' Received of Jacob Thompson the sum
</p>
<p>of fifty dollars on account of Dr. Blackburn.' That was about the
</p>
<p>nth or 1 2th of August last. The next day I wrote to Messrs.
</p>
<p>Wall & Company, of Washington, desiring them to send me an
</p>
<p>account of the sales, and the balance due me. When I received
</p>
<p>their answer, I took it to Colonel Thompson. He then said he
</p>
<p>was perfectly satisfied I had done my part, and gave me a check
</p>
<p>for fifty dollars on the Ontario Bank. I gave him a receipt :
</p>
<p>' Received of Jacob Thompson one hundred dollars in full on
</p>
<p>account of Dr. Luke P. Blackburn.' I told Thompson of the large
</p>
<p>sum which Dr. Blackburn had promised me for my services and
</p>
<p>that he and Mr. Holcomb had both told me that the Confederate
</p>
<p>government had appropriated two million dollars for the purpose
</p>
<p>of carrying it out ; but he would not pay me any more. When
</p>
<p>Dr. Blackburn returned from Bermuda, I wrote to him at Mont-
</p>
<p>treal, and told him I wanted some money, and that he ought to
</p>
<p>send me some ; but he made no reply to my letter. I was then
</p>
<p>sent down to Montreal with a commission for Bennett H. Young,
</p>
<p>to be used in his defense it the St. Albans raid case. I there
</p>
<p>met Dr. Blackburn. He said I had written some hard letters to
</p>
<p>him, abusing him, and that he had no money to give me. He
</p>
<p>then got into his carriage at the door and rode off to some races,
</p>
<p>I think, and never gave me any more satisfaction. As I wanted
</p>
<p>money before leaving for the States, I went to the Clifton House,
</p>
<p>Niagara. Dr. Blackburn told me he had no money with him then,
</p>
<p>but that he would go to Mr. Holcomb and get some, as he had Con-
</p>
<p>federate funds with him. Blackburn said that when I returned he
</p>
<p>would get the money for the expedition from either Holcomb or
</p>
<p>Thompson, it did not matter which. From this, and from Holcomb
</p>
<p>and Clay both shaking hands with me and congratulating me at

<p>Hamilton upon my safe return, I thought, of course, they knew all
</p>
<p>about it. I do not know that Dr. Stewart Robinson knew of the
</p>
<p>business in which I was engaged, but he took good care of me while
</p>
<p>130 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>I was at Toronto, in the fall, and until Dr. Blackburn wrote for me
</p>
<p>in the spring ; and when he gave me Dr. Blackburn's letter, he told
</p>
<p>me to borrow the money from Mr. Preston to take me to Mon-
</p>
<p>treal, as he said he did not want to commit an overt act against
</p>
<p>the Government of the United States himself. Mr. Preston lent
</p>
<p>me ten dollars to go to Montreal. On arriving at that place,
</p>
<p>according to the directions of Dr. Blackburn's letter, I went to
</p>
<p>Mr. Slaughter to get the means to take me to Halifax. Mr.
</p>
<p>Slaughter was short of funds, and had only twenty dollars that
</p>
<p>he could give me. He said that I had better go to Mr. Holcomb,
</p>
<p>who was staying at the Donegan Hotel, and he would give me the
</p>
<p>balance. I went to the Hotel and sent up my name, and he sent
</p>
<p>for me to come up. I told him I wanted some money to take me
</p>
<p>to Halifax ; he asked me how much I wanted ; I told him as much
</p>
<p>as would make up forty dollars ; he said ' You had better take fifty
</p>
<p>dollars,' but as I did not want that much I only took enough to
</p>
<p>make forty dollars. When I came to Washington to dispose of
</p>
<p>my goods, which was on the 5th of August, 1864, I put up at
</p>
<p>the National Hotel, registered my name as J. W. Harris, under
</p>
<p>which name I did business with Wall & Company."
</p>
<p>Here we have a straightforward, circumstantial account of the
</p>
<p>efforts made and the means used to spread pestilence and death
</p>
<p>amongst citizens and soldiers alike, in the capital of the nation,
</p>
<p>and in other cities and camps, a special consignment, supposed
</p>
<p>to contain the contagion of yellow fever and small-pox, being sent
</p>
<p>as " a donation to President Lincoln." This was for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of taking his life, and at the risk of the lives of his house-
</p>
<p>hold. Blackburn, Clay, Thompson, and Holcomb were the
</p>
<p>originators of the plan, and as guilty as the infamous scoundrel,
</p>
<p>Hyams, who, to gratify his desire for revenge on them for their
</p>
<p>perfidy in putting him off with a mere pittance of the promised
</p>
<p>reward for his services in the matter, comes before the Commis-
</p>
<p>sion and reveals the whole history of their infamy. No one who
</p>
<p>reads his story will doubt that he was a conscienceless scoundrel,

<p>who, for the hope of obtaining a large sum of money, according
</p>
<p>to their promise, was willing to make himself an instrument in the
</p>
<p>wholesale and indiscriminate destruction of human life. But

</p>
<p>monster as he was, he was not more a monster than was each one
</p>
<p>of his employers He was evidently a man well qualified for the
</p>
<p>task in which he was employed ; in the first place destitute of
</p>
<p>conscience, and then a man of a good degree of intelligence,
</p>
<p>shrewdness, and knowledge of affairs. Granting that he was
</p>
<p>selected by Dr. Robinson, and recommended by him to Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn, he could not have made a better selection had he
</p>
<p>had full knowledge of the work cut out for him to do. And when
</p>
<p>we consider Blackburn's perfidy in his dealings with him, pledging
</p>
<p>his faith as a freemason and giving him his hand in friendship,
</p>
<p>assuring him that he would never deceive him ; then building
</p>
<p>him up in the idea that he would receive one hundred thousand
</p>
<p>dollars, and perhaps ten times that amount as his reward ; and
</p>
<p>then, after he had performed a service that put his own life in
</p>
<p>jeopardy, to put him off with a mere pittance of the amount
</p>
<p>promised, we cannot wonder that a man constituted as Hyams
</p>
<p>was should divulge the terrible secret in revenge for the shabby
</p>
<p>treatment he had received at their hands.
</p>
<p>See how Clay and Holcomb meet him on his return ! They
</p>
<p>understand all about the character of his mission, congratulate
</p>
<p>him on his safe return, and on the fact that from thenceforth he
</p>
<p>was not to be known as a laboring man and a mechanic, but as a
</p>
<p>gentleman.
</p>
<p>No wonder that he, when for the pitiful sum of one hundred
</p>

<p>that they may hang together. They broke faith with Hyams, and

<p>not avail to say that a man who could be hired to do such a thing
</p>
<p>as this is unworthy of credence, even under oath, and so that his
</p>
<p>testimony is not to be received. Hyams' story bears on its face
</p>
<p>the marks of a truthful narrative of the facts, just as they occurred,
</p>
<p>and it does not follow that because a man is a confessed scoundrel
</p>
<p>he is incapable of telling the truth. No adequate motive for false-
</p>
<p>hood in this case can be assigned. Had his employers kept faith
</p>
<p>with him, he would no doubt have kept their terrible secret, and
</p>
<p>it would have been buried with him. That they did not, only
</p>
<p>becomes a reason for his disclosure of the facts, not for his fabri-
</p>
<p>cation of falsehoods. But then his statement as to how he dis-
</p>
<p>posed of the goods in Washington City is fully confirmed by the
</p>
<p>testimony of Wall & Company, who produced an account of
</p>
<p>the transaction agreeing exactly, in date and amount, with that
</p>
<p>given by Hyams, and also in regard to his alias of J. W. Harris.
</p>
<p>It was also corroborated by the National Hotel register of that
</p>
<p>date.
</p>
<p>Conover testified to this as one of the schemes planned by
</p>
<p>Thompson and his gang, and Hyams gives a full account of
</p>
<p>the manner of its execution. For some reason the infection
</p>
<p>was a failure in Washington City ; but not so with the goods sent
</p>
<p>by Myers, the sutler, to New Berne, N.C. It will be recol-
</p>
<p>lected that an epidemic of yellow fever broke out there in the
</p>
<p>latter part of the summer of 1864, that swept away farge numbers
</p>
<p>of people, both citizens and soldiers. No doubt this epidemic was
</p>
<p>due to the infection carried in the clothing that Myers received
</p>
<p>from Hyams, to be sold on commission ; and that in the great day

<p>tory of this attempt as narrated in his confession, by Robert C.
</p>
<p>Kennedy, one of the gang of incendiaries sent there for that pur-
</p>
<p>ATROCITIES NOT EMBRACED IN THE CHARGE. 133
</p>
<p>pose, who was arrested, tried, found guilty, condemned, and hanged
</p>
<p>for his crime. Before his execution he made a full confession as
</p>
<p>follows :-
</p>
<p>" After my escape from Johnson's Island I went to Canada, where I met a number
</p>
<p>of Confederates. They asked me if I was willing to go on an expedition. I replied:
</p>
<p>' Yes, if it is in the service of my country.' They said: ' It is all right,' but gave me
</p>
<p>no intimation of its nature, nor did I ask for any. I was then sent to New York, where
</p>
<p>I stayed some time. There were eight men of our party, of whom two fled to Canada.
</p>
<p>After we had been in New York three weeks we were told that the object of our expe-
</p>
<p>dition was to retaliate on the North for the atrocities in the Shenandoah Valley. It
</p>
<p>was designed to set fire to the city on the night of the Presidential election; but the
</p>
<p>phosphorus was not ready, and it was put off until the 25th of November. I was
</p>
<p>stopping at the Belmont House, but moved into Prince Street. I set fire to four
</p>
<p>places in Barnum's Museum, Lovejoy's Hotel, Tammany Hotel, and the New Eng-
</p>
<p>land House. The others merely started fires in the house where each one was lodging,
</p>
<p>and then ran off. Had they all done as I did, we would have had thirty-two fires and
</p>
<p>played a huge joke on the fire department. I know that I am to be hung for setting
</p>
<p>fire to Barnum's Museum, but that was only a joke. I had no idea of doing it. I had
</p>
<p>been drinking and went in there with a friend, and, just to scare the people, I emptied
</p>
<p>a bottle of phosphorus on the floor. We knew it would not set fire to the wood, for
</p>
<p>we had tried it before, and at one time had concluded to give the thing up. There
</p>
<p>was no fiendishness about it. After setting fire to my four places, I walked the streets all
</p>
<p>night, and went to the Exchange Hotel early in the morning. We all met there that
</p>
<p>morning and the next night. My friend and I had rooms there, but we sat in the
</p>
<p>office nearly all the time reading the papers, while we were watched by the detectives,
</p>
<p>of whom the hotel was full. I expected to die then, and if I had it would have been
</p>
<p>all right; but now it seems rather hard. I escaped to Canada and was glad enough
</p>
<p>when I crossed the bridge in safety. I desired, however, to return to my command,
</p>
<p>and started with my friend for the Confederacy via Detroit. Just before entering the
</p>
<p>city he received an intimation that the detectives were on the look-out for us, and giv-
</p>
<p>ing me the signal he jumped from the cars. I did not notice the signal, but kept on
</p>
<p>and was arrested in the depot. I wish to say that the killing of women and children
</p>
<p>was the last thing thought of. We wanted to let the people of the North understand
</p>
<p>that there were two sides to this war, and that they could not be rolling in wealth and

<p>comfort while we at the South were bearing all the hardships and privations. In retal-
</p>
<p>iation for Sheridan's atrocities in the Shenandoah Valley, we desired to destroy prop-
</p>

<p>Kennedy, in the presence of death, made this free and full con-
</p>
<p>fession, carefully confining himself to the narration of his own and
</p>
<p>the acts of his fellow incendiaries. He does not tell who planned

<p>the country, and whilst honestly confessing his own part in it, is
</p>
<p>very careful not to compromise anybody else. But we are not left
</p>
<p>without information as to who were the employers of him and his
</p>
<p>gang ; and here again Thompson and his fellow agents of the rebel
</p>
<p>government in Canada are made to appear as its originators, and
</p>
<p>must be held responsible, not only for the attempt thus made to
</p>
<p>destroy New York by fire, but also for the worst consequences that
</p>
<p>could have happened had their attempt proven successful. 1 Ken-
</p>
<p>nedy says they did not desire to destroy the lives of women and
</p>
<p>children, although that would of course have followed in its train.
</p>
<p>Thompson, Clay, Cleary, Sanders, and any others that had any
</p>
<p>hand in setting this expedition on foot, could not fail to know what
</p>
<p>would necessarily follow in its train if successful, but were not de-
</p>
<p>terred by the knowledge of the fact that it involved not merely the
</p>
<p>destruction of property, but of necessity also the destruction of
</p>
<p>women and children ; for the firing of a city like New York in many
</p>
<p>places, simultaneously, if successful in its object, the destruction of
</p>
<p>the city, must necessarily result in the same kind of indiscriminate
</p>
<p>destruction of human life that resulted at New Berne, from the dis-
</p>
<p>semination of pestilence sent there in the clothing that that inhu-
</p>
<p>man fiend, Dr. Blackburn, had carefully infected and sent there for
</p>
<p>that very purpose. In the early ages of the world war meant the
</p>
<p>indiscriminate destruction of all that belonged to the enemy. The
</p>
<p>spirit of war then was to exterminate the foe. Prisoners of war
</p>
<p>were slaughtered after the battle was ended. Women and chil-
</p>
<p>dren were killed or carried into slavery. Men had not learned to
</p>
<p>exercise mercy in war. It meant universal destruction of life, and
</p>
<p>confiscation of the property of the enemy. It meant even the con-
</p>
<p>fiscation of the territory or country in which he lived. T t is so
</p>
<p>yet among the savage tribes of the earth. With them the murder of
</p>
<p>a woman about to become a mother is nothing, and the dashing out
</p>
<p>of the brains of her children against a stone or a tree, before her
</p>
<p>eyes, yields to them a fiendish satisfaction. Civilized nations, how-
</p>
<p>ever, do not so carry on war, and the laws of war do not permit this

<p>most rude and savage people of the earth, afford examples more
</p>
<p>atrocious than those planned and executed, or attempted to be
</p>
<p>executed, by these agents of Jefferson Davis in Canada, and by
</p>
<p>other agents, as we shall see, whose deeds were sanctioned and paid
</p>
<p>for by Davis and his Secretary of State Benjamin.
</p>
<p>The prison-pen at Andersonville was evidently planned for the
</p>
<p>destruction of the lives of the prisoners of war that were sent
</p>
<p>there ; and if any escaped death, it was intended that they should
</p>
<p>be so physically injured that they could never again render any
</p>
<p>service to the Union cause. In a country abounding in forest
</p>
<p>shade and pure water, there can be no excuse given for locating a
</p>
<p>prison-pen in a little intervale, wholly destitue of shade, where
</p>
<p>men without tents or shelter of any kind were huddled together
</p>
<p>by the thousands, with a very meagre supply of water, for a long
</p>
<p>time, even for quenching thirst, and none at all for the purposes
</p>
<p>of cleanliness, and what they had for the former purpose being con-
</p>
<p>taminated with all the filth from the drainage of the town just above.
</p>
<p>It is evident that this location was made with a view to the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of life and the ruin of health. Then, for the further carrying
</p>
<p>out of this purpose, the rations supplied were not only wholly
</p>
<p>insufficient in quantity, but most unwholesome in quality, exactly
</p>
<p>adapted to aid the effects of miasmatic exposure, and foul water,
</p>
<p>in bringing on stomach and bowel troubles and low forms of fever,
</p>
<p>which were kept up until life was literally drained out, and death
</p>
<p>from exhaustion ensued. Here, without any sympathetic medical
</p>
<p>assistance or proper medicine, men were dying daily by the fifties
</p>
<p>and the hundreds, and the survivors becoming mere ghostly
</p>
<p>spectres ; whilst the inhuman monster, Wirtz, stood gloating over
</p>
<p>the scene in devilish glee, and his inhuman guards were con-
</p>
<p>stantly on the lookout for pretexts to shoot down their fellowmen,
</p>
<p>as though the terrible harvest of death, secured by their arrange-
</p>
<p>ments and management of this graveyard of the living, was too
</p>
<p>meagre, and required their bullets to enrich it. Such was Ander-
</p>
<p>sonville. The purpose of its location and management are too

<p>obvious to need remark ; and for all this, Jefferson Davis and his
</p>
<p>Secretary of War are to be held responsible. Far be it from me
</p>
<p>to bring up this matter for the purpose of giving a fresh impulse
</p>
<p>136 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>to sectional enmity. I only do it to show the low moral status of
</p>
<p>those who were responsible for the conduct of the war on the side
</p>
<p>of the rebellion, in order that from all this we may be prepared
</p>
<p>for the evidence presented to the world through the Commission,
</p>
<p>sustaining the grave charges of the government.
</p>
<p>There was no doubt an element, perhaps a large element of the
</p>
<p>population of the Southern States, that was in full sympathy with
</p>
<p>this policy ; but such a policy could only have been abhorrent to
</p>
<p>the honorable foe who bravely confronted us on the field of con-
</p>
<p>flict. It was the stay-at-home-and-fight element that sanctioned
</p>
<p>these atrocities. War is cruel when conducted on the strictest
</p>
<p>rules of civilized warfare. War is destructive ; it is harsh and
</p>
<p>unrelenting. Foeman must meet foeman with his steel. It is a
</p>
<p>game in which human life is always the price of success and the
</p>
<p>cost of failure. The enemy must be met and overcome ; his
</p>
<p>resources must be reached and cut off if it can be done, thus
</p>
<p>starving him into submission, as a more humane way of getting the
</p>
<p>victory over him than by taking his life. But amongst civilized
</p>
<p>people no enemy is to be deprived of life but the armed and
</p>
<p>active foe in the field, in honorable and open combat, except for
</p>
<p>crime. The lives of women, children, prisoners of war, and of
</p>
<p>non-combatants generally, must be held sacred. Thus we see
</p>
<p>how much the horrors of war have been mitigated by the more
</p>
<p>enlightened sentiments and Christian morality of the world's pres-
</p>
<p>ent state of civilization. When these shall have done their perfect
</p>
<p>work, wars will cease. The time will yet come when men shall
</p>
<p>learn war no more. May God hasten the day.
</p>
<p>In charging Jefferson Davis, and those associated with him in
</p>
<p>the conduct of the war with an utter disregard of the laws of war,
</p>
<p>and of being guilty of atrocities that are only matched in savage
</p>
<p>life, I wish again to make a distinct disclaimer in behalf of those
</p>
<p>who fought, and of those who conducted his operations in the
</p>
<p>field. Whilst I abhor their construction of the Constitution and
</p>
<p>theory of the union of the States as destructive of the hopes of

</p>
<p>tion, and making the idea of a nation an impossibility, I admire

<p>and honor the courage and bravery with which they maintained

</p>
<p>their theory, and accord to them the honor, as well as the courage
</p>
<p>of true soldiers.
</p>
<p>To them the idea of winning success by the means we have had
</p>
<p>under consideration, and for which we have found the political
</p>
<p>leaders of the rebellion responsible, including the highest officer of
</p>
<p>the Confederacy, would have been as abhorrent as to myself. Not
</p>
<p>a word that I have written can tarnish the fame of the true soldier ;
</p>
<p>and I have carefully avoided charging anything against even the
</p>
<p>politicians of the Confederacy that is not sustained by indisputa-
</p>
<p>ble evidence. Considered morally, their methods can never be
</p>
<p>justified ; yet it was by these methods, with assassination added,
</p>
<p>that the political leaders of the rebellion sought to obtain success,
</p>
<p>and because of this, must for all time in history fall under the
</p>
<p>condemnation of the enlightened Christian conscience of the
</p>
<p>world. That they were guilty of all these things has been
</p>
<p>abundantly proven ; but as we shall see, the evidence has not yet
</p>
<p>been exhausted. They attempt to shield themselves under the
</p>
<p>claim of justifiable retaliation. Retaliation for what? They
</p>
<p>answer, " The atrocities committed by Sheridan in the Shenan-
</p>
<p>doah Valley." Let us consider this question for a moment. It
</p>
<p>was the fortune of the writer to be serving under Sheridan at the
</p>
<p>time these alleged atrocities were committed, and to be an eye-
</p>
<p>witness of them. What did Sheridan do? He burnt all the stack-
</p>
<p>yards and barns containing grain and hay, and all the mills and
</p>
<p>factories found in the valley from above Harrisonburg on down to
</p>
<p>near Winchester, or perhaps lower down than that. He also
</p>
<p>appropriated all the horses, cattle, sheep, etc., that could have
</p>
<p>been made available for the support and aid of an enemy. He
</p>
<p>dealt merely with property, and that such property alone as would
</p>
<p>have enabled General Lee again to have threatened the national
</p>
<p>capital by an invading foe by this route, as he had twice, or
</p>
<p>oftener, done before, thus making it necessary to employ a large
</p>
<p>force from our army in guarding this route. General Grant deter-
</p>
<p>mined to render this division of his forces unnecessary, by render-

</p>
<p>ing the valley impracticable to Lee by this destruction of the
</p>
<p>abundant supplies that it furnished, in order that he might have
</p>
<p>the benefit of Sheridan's forces in his investment of Richmond.
</p>
<p>138 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>It was simply the destruction of property by which the rebellion
</p>
<p>could sustain itself, and thus prolong its existence, in order to
</p>
<p>shorten the war, and thus save the expenditure of human life.
</p>
<p>There was no property destroyed or confiscated but such as could
</p>
<p>be used for the subsistence and movements of an army. It was
</p>
<p>simply a question of shortening the war, and thus economizing
</p>
<p>human life by the destruction of property, and so was a measure
</p>
<p>fully justified by the laws and usages of war. Sheridan acted
</p>
<p>under Grant's orders in this matter, and his acts were only atrocious
</p>
<p>as war itself is atrocious, and can never serve as a justification
</p>
<p>of schemes that in every instance involved the lives of non-com-
</p>
<p>batants, and even of women and children. All of this destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of property in the Shenandoah Valley by Sheridan was done,
</p>
<p>and accounted for, strictly in accordance with the laws and usages
</p>
<p>of war, and has never been challenged by the civilized nations of
</p>
<p>the world as an unwarranted atrocity. It was harsh in the extreme ;
</p>
<p>but as a military necessity it was justifiable. It included in its
</p>
<p>object mercy towards the lives of men.
</p>
<p>As the cause of the Confederacy began to lose ground in the
</p>
<p>summer of 1864, and the signal success of our arms made it clear
</p>
<p>that it would not be able to maintain the fight to a successful
</p>
<p>close, the political leaders became desperate and reckless as to the
</p>
<p>means to which they resorted. The City Point explosion, the burn-
</p>
<p>ing of a number of steamboats on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,
</p>
<p>and the burning of a soldiers', or United States, hospital at Louis-
</p>
<p>ville, Ky., were amongst the occurrences of that eventful summer.
</p>
<p>The following extract from the report of John Maxwell to Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Z. McDaniel, commanding Torpedo Company, explains the
</p>
<p>City Point explosion :
</p>
<p>"Captain: I have the honor to report that in obedience to
</p>
<p>your order, and with the means and equipments furnished me by
</p>
<p>you, I left this city (Richmond) 26th July last for the line of the
</p>
<p>James River, to operate with the ' hozological torpedo ' against the
</p>
<p>enemy's vessels navigating that river. I had with me Mr. R. K.

<p>Dillard, who was well acquainted with the localities, and whose
</p>
<p>services I engaged for the expedition.
</p>
<p>" On arriving in Isle of Wight County, on the 2d of August,
</p>
<p>ATROCITIES NOT EMBRACED IN THE CHARGE. 139
</p>
<p>we learned of immense supplies of stores being landed at City
</p>
<p>Point; and for the purpose, by stratagem, of introducing our
</p>
<p>machine upon the vessels there discharging stores, started for
</p>
<p>that point. We reached there before day-break on the 9th of
</p>
<p>August last, having travelled mostly by night, and crawled upon
</p>
<p>our knees to pass the east picket line. Requesting my companion
</p>
<p>to remain behind about half a mile, I approached cautiously the
</p>
<p>wharf, with my machine and powder covered by. a small box.
</p>
<p>Finding the captain had come ashore from a barge then at the
</p>
<p>wharf, I seized the occasion to hurry forward with my box.
</p>
<p>Being halted by one of the wharf sentinels, I succeeded in pass-
</p>
<p>ing him by representing that the captain had ordered me to con-
</p>
<p>vey the box on board. Hailing a man from the barge, I put the
</p>
<p>machine in motion, and gave it in his charge. He carried it
</p>
<p>aboard. The machine contained about twelve pounds of powder.
</p>
<p>Rejoining my companion we retired to a safe distance to witness
</p>
<p>the effect of our effort.
</p>
<p>" In about an hour the explosion took place. Its effect was com-
</p>
<p>municated to another barge beyond the one operated upon, and
</p>
<p>also to a large wharf building containing their stores (enemy's),
</p>
<p>which was totally destroyed. The scene was terriffic, and the
</p>
<p>effect deafened my companion to an extent from which he has
</p>
<p>not recovered. My own person was severely shocked, but I am
</p>
<p>thankful to Providence that we have both escaped without injury.
</p>
<p>We obtained and enclose slips from the enemy's newspapers, which
</p>
<p>afford their testimony of the terrible effects of the blow. The
</p>
<p>enemy estimate the loss of life at fifty-eight killed and one hun-
</p>
<p>dred and twenty-six wounded, but we have reason to believe it
</p>
<p>greatly exceeded that.
</p>
<p>" The pecuniary damage we heard estimated at four millions of
</p>
<p>dollars ; but of course we can give you no account of the extent of
</p>
<p>it exactly. I may be permitted, Captain, here to remark that a
</p>
<p>party of ladies, it seems, were killed by this explosion. It is sad-
</p>
<p>dening to me to realize the fact that the terrible effects of war [he

<p>should have added as thus conducted] induce such consequences ;
</p>
<p>but when I remember the ordeal to which our own women have
</p>
<p>been submitted, and the barbarities of the enemy's crusade against
</p>
<p>140 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>us and them, my feelings are relieved by the reflection that whilst
</p>
<p>this catastrophe was not intended by us, it amounts only, in the
</p>
<p>providence of God, to just retribution"
</p>
<p>Hear the pious scoundrel salving his conscience with the old
</p>
<p>cry of " just retribution ! "
</p>
<p>The following will explain the agency by which boats on the
</p>
<p>Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and the United States Hospital at
</p>
<p>Louisville, Ky., were burned. It is the testimony of Edward
</p>
<p>Frazier before the Commission:
</p>
<p>" I am a steamboat man, and have been making St. Louis my
</p>
<p>home for the last nine or ten years. During 1864 I knew of
</p>
<p>the operations of Tucker, Minor Majors, Thomas L. Clark, and
</p>
<p>Colonel Barrett, of Missouri, for burning boats carrying govern-
</p>
<p>ment freight, transports, and other vessels on the Ohio and Miss-
</p>
<p>issippi and other rivers. These men were in the service of the
</p>
<p>Confederate Government. I knew of the following steamboats
</p>
<p>having been burned by the operations of these parties : the ' Im-
</p>
<p>perial,' ' Hiawatha,' the ' Robert Campbell,' the ' Louisville,' the
</p>
<p>' Daniel G. Taylor,' and others, besides some in New Orleans
</p>
<p>that I do not know the names of. The ' Imperial ' was one of
</p>
<p>the largest and finest transports on the western waters. In the
</p>
<p>case of the burning of the ' Robert Campbell,' which was
</p>
<p>destroyed in the stream when under way, at Milikin's Bend,
</p>
<p>twenty-five- miles above Vicksburg, there was a considerable loss
</p>
<p>of life. The agent who destroyed this boat was on board. These
</p>
<p>boats were all owned by private individuals. The operations of
</p>
<p>these men were to include government hospitals, store-houses,
</p>
<p>and everything appertaining to the enemy. A United States
</p>
<p>hospital at Louisville was burned in June or July of 1 864. I do
</p>
<p>not know who burned it, but a man named Dillingham claimed
</p>
<p>compensation for it. I was in Richmond from the 2Oth to the
</p>
<p>25th or 26th of August last, when I had an interview with the rebel
</p>
<p>Secretary of War, the Secretary of State, and Mr. Jefferson Davis.
</p>
<p>Thomas L. Clark, Dillingham, and myself, called there in connec-

</p>
<p>tion with the boat burning, and put in claims to Mr. James A.
</p>
<p>Seddon, the rebel Secretary of War. Mr. Clark introduced me
</p>
<p>to Mr. Seddon. He told me that he had thrown up that business,
</p>
<p>ATROCITIES NOT EMBRACED IN THE CHARGE. 141
</p>
<p>that it was now in the hands of Mr. Benjamin. We went to him,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Benjamin looked at the papers we brought him, and
</p>
<p>asked me if I knew anything about them. I told him that I did,
</p>
<p>and that I believed they were all right. He asked me if 'I was
</p>
<p>from St. Louis. I told him I was. He then asked Mr. Clark if
</p>
<p>he knew me to be all right, and he said I had been represented
</p>
<p>to him by Mr. Majors as being all right. Mr. Benjamin told us
</p>
<p>all three to call the next day. We did so, when he said he had
</p>
<p>shown these papers to Jefferson Davis, and he (Benjamin) wanted
</p>
<p>to know if we would not take thirty thousand dollars and sign
</p>
<p>receipts in full. We told him we would not. Mr. Benjamin then
</p>
<p>said that if Dillingham was to claim this in Louisville, he wanted
</p>
<p>a statement of it. We went back to the hotel, and I wrote the
</p>
<p>statement myself. It read that Mr. Dillingham had been hired
</p>
<p>by General Polk, and that he had been sent to Louisville expressly
</p>
<p>to do that work; namely, to burn the hospital. It was then
</p>
<p>talked over with Mr. Benjamin, and we made a settlement with
</p>
<p>him for fifty thousand dollars ; thirty-five thousand dollars down
</p>
<p>in gold, and fifteen thousand dollars on deposits, to be paid in
</p>
<p>four months, provided the claims proved correct. The money
</p>
<p>was paid by a draft on Columbia for thirty-four thousand, eight
</p>
<p>hundred dollars, in gold, and two hundred dollars in gold we got
</p>
<p>in Richmond. We received the gold on the draft at Columbia.
</p>
<p>Whilst in Richmond, Mr. Benjamin told me that Mr. Davis
</p>
<p>wanted to see me. I went in with Mr. Benjamin to see Mr. Davis,
</p>
<p>and we sat and talked. The conversation first was about what
</p>
<p>was called the Long Bridge, between Nashville and Chattanooga.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis wanted to know what I thought about destroying it.
</p>
<p>He said they had been thinking of it, and of sending some one to
</p>
<p>have it done. I told him I knew of the bridge, though I did not,
</p>
<p>for I had never been there, but did not know what to think
</p>
<p>about destroying it. He said I had better study it over. Finally
</p>
<p>I told him I thought it could be done. Mr. Benjamin, I believe
</p>
<p>it was, first remarked that he would give four hundred thousand

</p>
<p>dollars if that bridge was destroyed, and asked me if I would
</p>
<p>take charge of it. I told him I would not unless the passes
</p>
<p>were taken away from those men that were now down there, and
</p>
<p>142 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said it should be done. The conversation then turned
</p>
<p>on the burning of the steamboats. I told Mr. Davis that I did
</p>
<p>not think it was any use burning steamboats, and he said no, he
</p>
<p>was gt)ing to have that stopped. The next day I saw an order
</p>
<p>taking away passes issued on or before the 23d of August. These
</p>
<p>passes were permits to do this kind of work. I presume Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis knew that the money I received was for the work that I had
</p>
<p>done; he knew that I had received money there. Mr. Davis
</p>
<p>seemed fully aware of what we had done, and he did not condemn
</p>
<p>it. Mr. Majors and Barrett belonged to an organization known as
</p>
<p>the ' O. A. K.', or 'Order of American Knights.'" The witness
</p>
<p>was asked to state, if he thought proper to do so, whether he was
</p>
<p>also a member of that order ; but he declined to say. ' I under-
</p>
<p>stood ' (said the witness) ' that Colonel Barrett held the position
</p>
<p>of adjutant general of this organization, of the Sons of Liberty, for
</p>
<p>the State of Illinois. I do not know that Majors and Barrett were
</p>
<p>in Chicago in July last, but Mr. Majors left St. Louis either in
</p>
<p>June or July, to go to Canada, and I presume went there by way
</p>
<p>of Chicago."
</p>
<p>Here again, we see the moral plane on which Davis and
</p>
<p>Benjamin worked for the success of the Confederacy. We find
</p>
<p>them employing and paying agents for burning boats, midstream,
</p>
<p>regardless of the destruction of the lives of non-combatants, in-
</p>
<p>cluding, most likely, women and children amongst the passengers
</p>
<p>aboard ; burning a hospital filled with sick, wounded, and dying
</p>
<p>soldiers, who, according to the laws of civilized warfare, are
</p>
<p>entitled to the sacred protection of even the enemy, whether in or
</p>
<p>out of their territory and possession. We have now found Davis
</p>
<p>and his agents in Canada planning and carrying out schemes for
</p>
<p>assassination or murder by wholesale, by spreading pestilence,
</p>
<p>poisoning of reservoirs, burning cities, hospitals, and boats on
</p>
<p>their way loaded with passengers, and by the use of explosives
</p>
<p>murdering women. Human life, under any imaginable conditions
</p>
<p>of existence, received no consideration at their hands if its sacrifice

<p>held out to them any prospect of advancing their cause.
</p>
<p>Another foul plot to murder prisoners of war held in Libby
</p>
<p>Prison, right under the eyes of Davis and his Cabinet, is detailed
</p>
<p>ATROCITIES NOT EMBRACED IN THE CHARGE. 143
</p>
<p>as follows by Erastus W. Ross, a witness before the Commis-
</p>
<p>sion :
</p>
<p>" I was in the service of the rebel government. I was con-
</p>
<p>scripted and detailed as a clerk at Libby Prison, and never served
</p>
<p>in the army. In March, 1864, General Kilpatrick was making a
</p>
<p>raid in the direction of Richmond. About that time the prison
</p>
<p>was mined. I saw the place where I was told the powder was
</p>
<p>buried under the prison; it was in the middle of the building.
</p>
<p>The powder was put there secretly in the night. I never saw it,
</p>
<p>but I saw the fuse. It was put in the office. I was away at my
</p>
<p>uncle's the night that the powder was put there, and was told of
</p>
<p>it the next morning by one of the colored men at the prison.
</p>
<p>There were two sentinels near the place to prevent any person
</p>
<p>approaching it. The excavation made was about the size of a
</p>
<p>barrel head, and the earth was thrown up loosely over it. Major
</p>
<p>Turner, the commandant of the prison, had charge of the fuse.
</p>
<p>He told me that the powder was there, and that the fuse was to
</p>
<p>set it off; that it was put there for the security of the prisoners,
</p>
<p>and if the army got in it was to be set off for the purpose of
</p>
<p>blowing up the prison and the prisoners. The powder was
</p>
<p>secretly taken out in May, and the whole building was then shut
</p>
<p>up. The prisoners had all been sent to Macon, Ga. I sup-
</p>
<p>pose the powder was placed there by the authority of General
</p>
<p>Winder or the Secretary of War. Major Turner said he was
</p>
<p>acting under the authority of the rebel war department, though
</p>
<p>I never saw any written orders about it."
</p>
<p>John Latouche testified as follows: " I was first lieutenant in
</p>
<p>Company B, Twenty-fifth Virginia Battallion, C. S. A. I was
</p>
<p>detailed to post duty in Richmond to regulate the details of the
</p>
<p>guards of the military prisons there, and in March, 1864, I was
</p>
<p>on duty at Libby Prison. Major Turner, the keeper of the
</p>
<p>prison, told me that he was going to see General Winder about
</p>
<p>the guard. On his return he told me that General Winder himself
</p>
<p>had been to see the Secretary of War, and that they were going

</p>
<p>to put powder under the prison. In the morning of the same
</p>
<p>day the powder was brought. There were two kegs of about
</p>
<p>twenty-five pounds each, and a box which contained about as
</p>
<p>144 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>much as the kegs. A hole was dug in the centre of the middle
</p>
<p>basement, and the powder was put down there. The box when
</p>
<p>put in just came level with the ground, and the place was covered
</p>
<p>over with gravel. I did not see any fuse to it then. I placed a
</p>
<p>sentry over this powder so that no accident might occur, and the
</p>
<p>next day Major Turner, who had charge of the fuse, showed it to
</p>
<p>us in his office ; he showed it to everybody there. It was a long
</p>
<p>fuse made of gutta-percha, such a one as I had never seen before.
</p>
<p>In May, I think it was, Major Turner went South, and all of the
</p>
<p>prisoners were sent out of the Libby building proper to the
</p>
<p>south ; and General Winder sent a note down to the office with
</p>
<p>directions to take up the powder as privately or as secretly as
</p>
<p>possible. I forget his exact words. The note was delivered into
</p>
<p>my hands for the inspector of the prison, to whom I either gave
</p>
<p>or sent it. I afterward heard Major Turner say that in the event
</p>
<p>of the raiders coming into Richmond he would have blown up the
</p>
<p>prison. I understood him to say those were his orders."
</p>
<p>We are not left, however, to infer that this gunpowder plot, by
</p>
<p>which the lives of twelve hundred Union officers held as prisoners
</p>
<p>of war were to have been sacrificed in case Colonel Dahlgren
</p>
<p>should have gotten into the city for the purpose of their libera-
</p>
<p>tion, was authorized by the head of the rebel government.
</p>
<p>The box turned over by General Johnson to General Schofield,
</p>
<p>containing the archives of the Confederate government, contained
</p>
<p>the proof that Jefferson Davis ordered these preparations to be
</p>
<p>made, and that his subordinates had orders to carry the plot into
</p>
<p>execution in the event of the contingency above referred to.
</p>
<p>These archives also showed that in this he was sustained by the
</p>
<p>committee of the rebel congress on the conduct of the war.
</p>
<p>Pollard, also, in his history of the "Lost Cause," attempts to justify
</p>
<p>this plot. In all this we see the debasing influence of human
</p>
<p>bondage on the moral sense of a people. Who, except under the
</p>
<p>influence of such a demoralization, could have planned for the
</p>
<p>wholesale sacrifice of their prisoners of war?

<p>Here we have Mr. Seddon, the rebel Secretary of War, of course
</p>
<p>not on his own responsibility, but under the orders of his supe-
</p>
<p>rior, Jefferson Davis, ordering the officer in charge of the pris-

</p>
<p>oners of war in their possession to mine the building in which
</p>
<p>they were confined, and in the event of a Yankee raid entering
</p>
<p>the city, to blow up the building, and thus murder, at one fell
</p>
<p>swoop, all the prisoners in it to prevent their being rescued and
</p>
<p>taken back into the service. Need we wonder that an adminis-
</p>
<p>tration that could deliberately prepare to murder its prisoners of
</p>
<p>war rather than suffer their liberation under the fortunes of war,
</p>
<p>should have deliberately planned for the destruction of its pris-
</p>
<p>oners by the starvation and cruelties of Andersonville?
</p>
<p>It gives me no pleasure to rehearse these things, but it is due to
</p>
<p>the truth of history that they should be known. I desire to see a
</p>
<p>speedy and complete reconciliation of these two sections of our
</p>
<p>country ; and I have always rejoiced that we who faced each
</p>
<p>other on the fields of deadly conflict, have, from the time of the
</p>
<p>surrender of Lee's army, been ready to meet each other as friends
</p>
<p>and brothers and fellow citizens of a common country. The
</p>
<p>sight witnessed at Appomattox of the soldiers of our army empty-
</p>
<p>ing their haversacks to satisfy the wants of men who but the
</p>
<p>hour before stood confronting them as foes, but who now had laid
</p>
<p>down their arms, worn out and famishing, was a glorious exhibi-
</p>
<p>tion of the best side of our nature, and plainly said that though we
</p>
<p>had been enemies in war in peace we would be friends, and fore-
</p>
<p>shadowed the speedy reconciliation that has followed our terrible
</p>
<p>strife, so far as the soldiers of the two armies are concerned. I
</p>
<p>charge none of these things on these men. I fix the responsibility
</p>
<p>for these things on the political leaders of the rebellion, and not
</p>
<p>even on them indiscriminately but only on such of them as are
</p>
<p>named in the charge and specifications under which, through the
</p>
<p>medium of the Commission, they were arraigned before the world,
</p>
<p>and the evidence of their guilt was produced. It is to show that
</p>
<p>the government in so doing completely vindicated its dignity and
</p>
<p>honor that I write.
</p>
<p>If the acts of public men render them infamous in history, the
</p>
<p>responsibility rests in their bad exercise of that freedom of will

<p>for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln ; and will show, we

<p>CHAPTER XI.
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO SUSTAIN ITS
</p>
<p>CHARGE AND SPECIFICATIONS.
</p>
<p>THE following letter was found in the box turned over by
</p>
<p>General Joseph A. Johnson, at Charlotte, N.C., to General Scho-
</p>
<p>field, and said to contain the archives of the Confederate govern-
</p>
<p>ment:
</p>
<p>MONTGOMERY, WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, VA.
</p>
<p>To His EXCELLENCY, the President of the Confederate States of America :
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR: I have been thinking for some time that I would make this communica-
</p>
<p>tion to you, but have been deterred from doing so on account of ill health. I now offer
</p>
<p>you my services, and if you will favor me in my designs, I will proceed, as soon as
</p>
<p>my health will permit, to rid my country of some of her deadliest enemies, by striking
</p>
<p>at the very heart's blood of those who seek to enchain her in slavery. I consider
</p>
<p>nothing dishonorable having such a tendency. All I ask of you is to favor me by
</p>
<p>granting me the necessary passes, etc., on which to travel while in the jurisdiction of
</p>
<p>the Confederate government. I am perfectly familiar with the North, and feel con-
</p>
<p>fident I can execute anything I undertake. I am just returned from within their
</p>
<p>lines. I am a lieutenant in General Duke's command, and I was on the raid last
</p>
<p>June in Kentucky under General John H. Morgan. I and all of my command except-
</p>
<p>ing about three or four, and two commissioned officers, were taken prisoners ; but
</p>
<p>finding a good opportunity, while being taken to prison, I made my escape from them.
</p>
<p>Dressing myself in the garb of a citizen, I attempted to pass through the mountains,
</p>
<p>but finding that impossible, narrowly escaping two or three times from being retaken,
</p>
<p>I shaped my course north, and went through to the Canadas, from where, by the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of Colonel Holcomb, I succeeded in making my way around and through the
</p>
<p>blockade; but having yellow fever, etc., at Bermuda, I have been rendered unfit for
</p>
<p>service since my arrival. I was reared up m the State of Alabama, and educated in its
</p>
<p>university. Both the Secretary of War and his assistant, Judge Campbell, are per-
</p>
<p>sonally acquainted with my father, William J. Alston, of the fifth Congressional Dis-
</p>
<p>trict of Alabama, having served in the time of the old Congress, in the years 1849-50
</p>
<p>and 1851. If I do anything for you, I shall expect your full confidence in return. If
</p>
<p>you do this, I can render you and my country very important service. Let me hear
</p>
<p>from you soon. I am anxious to be doing something, and having no command at
</p>
<p>present, all, or nearly all, being in garrison, I desire that you favor me in this a short

</p>
<p>time. I would like to have a personal interview with you, in order to perfect the
</p>
<p>arrangements before starting.
</p>
<p>I am, very respectfully,
</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,
</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT W. ALSTON.
</p>
<p>This letter, it will be observed, is without date ; but the box in
</p>
<p>which it was found was marked, " Adjutant and Inspector Gen-
</p>
<p>eral's Office; letters received July to December, 1864." Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant Alston was captured in Kentucky in June, 1864, and so,
</p>
<p>in making his escape through Canada, made the acquaintance of
</p>
<p>the rebel agents there, just at the time that they were full of
</p>
<p>the assassination scheme. It was probably from his intercourse
</p>
<p>with them that he became infatuated with this idea, although he
</p>
<p>does not give them the credit of it. He seems to have been an
</p>
<p>ambitious youth who desired to impress the rebel President with
</p>
<p>the idea that this was an original scheme of his own. Mark how
</p>
<p>unblushingly he opens his mind to Davis in presenting his plot !
</p>
<p>It is nothing less than " striking at the heart's blood of some of
</p>
<p>his country's deadliest foes," of whom everybody then knew that
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was universally regarded in the South as
</p>
<p>chief. It is a plain offer to aid his country's cause by entering
</p>
<p>upon the policy of assassinating the loyal men of the country
</p>
<p>whose official duty required them to put down the rebellion.
</p>
<p>He considers nothing dishonorable that tends to accomplish
</p>
<p>this. He does not merely propose to strike at the heart's blood
</p>
<p>of Abraham Lincoln. No ; like the Canada conspirators, he has a
</p>
<p>more comprehensive scheme. Did Jefferson Davis feel insulted
</p>
<p>by being thought capable of giving his sanction to such a foul and
</p>
<p>dishonorable proposition? Let us see.

<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 149
</p>
<p>Would like to have an interview and explain. Respectfully referred, by direction of
</p>
<p>the President, to the Honorable Secretary of War.
</p>
<p>BURTON N. HARRISON,
</p>
<p>Private Secretary.
</p>
<p>Received November igth, 1864.
</p>
<p>Recorded book A.A.G.O., December i6th, 1864.
</p>
<p>A.G. for attention.
</p>
<p>By order of J. A. CAMPBELL, A.S.W.
</p>
<p>The handwriting of the private secretary of Jefferson Davis,
</p>
<p>Burton N. Harrison, and of the Assistant Secretary of War, J. A.
</p>
<p>Campbell, in the endorsements, was verified before the Commis-
</p>
<p>sion by Lewis W. Chamberlain, who had been a clerk in the war
</p>
<p>department at Richmond, and was well acquainted with the hand-
</p>
<p>writing of both of these gentlemen.
</p>
<p>From the consideration given by the rebel President, as shown
</p>
<p>by these careful and favorable endorsements, would it be unreason-
</p>
<p>able to conclude that Lieutenant Alston was granted the interview
</p>
<p>that he desired, and that, armed with the permission and authority
</p>
<p>of the rebel chief, he became one of the active participants in the
</p>
<p>closing scenes of the drama?
</p>
<p>We have other evidence that at this very time the mind of Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson Davis was turned in this direction, and that he was inciting
</p>
<p>his agents in Canada to turn their attention to a grand political
</p>
<p>scheme of wholesale assassinations.
</p>
<p>To show the moral obtundity of the political stay-at-home-and-
</p>
<p>fight rebels about this time, I will reproduce an advertisement of
</p>
<p>this proposition to assassinate President Lincoln and the other
</p>
<p>civil officers of the government, that was published in the Selma
</p>
<p>(Alabama) Dispatch, in December, 1864, under the caption
</p>
<p>"MILLION DOLLARS FOR ASSASSINATION
</p>
<p>" One million dollars wanted to have peace by the ist of March. If the citizens of
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy will furnish me with the cash, or good securities for the sum
</p>
<p>of one million dollars, I will cause the lives of Abraham Lincoln, William H. Seward,
</p>
<p>and Andrew Johnson to be taken by the ist of March next. This will give us peace,

<p>and satisfy the world that cruel tyrants cannot live in a land of liberty. If this is not
</p>
<p>accomplished, nothing will be claimed beyond the sum of fifty thousand dollars in
</p>
<p>advance, which is supposed to be necessary to reach and slaughter the three villains.
</p>
<p>I will give, myself, one thousand dollars towards this patriotic purpose. Every one
</p>
<p>wishing to contribute will address Box X, Cahawba, Alabama. December ist, 1864."
</p>
<p>150 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>This advertisement was proven by compositors in the Dispatch
</p>
<p>office to have been put in that paper by Mr. G. W. Gale, a law-
</p>
<p>yer of considerable reputation, and that the copy was in his hand-
</p>
<p>writing, which was well known at that office. My impression is
</p>
<p>that several of the Richmond papers reproduced this advertisement,
</p>
<p>as also many other papers in the Confederacy. The treasonable
</p>
<p>purpose to overthrow the Constitution by the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President, Vice-President, and Secretary of State shows that the
</p>
<p>plan had been maturely considered in the light of the condi-
</p>
<p>tions that would render it most effective in securing the object in
</p>
<p>view, and that it was a deep political scheme to give the rebellion
</p>
<p>a new lease of life, and put it on its feet again under more favor-
</p>
<p>able conditions for success. I have already given incidentally, and
</p>
<p>in a fragmentary way, glimpses of the testimony on which the
</p>
<p>charges of the government were founded. I will now present in
</p>
<p>a connected form the testimony bearing on the question.
</p>
<p>Richard Montgomery testified before the Commission that
</p>
<p>Thompson said to him in the summer of 1864 that he had his
</p>
<p>friends all over the North, and that he could have anybody put out
</p>
<p>of his way that he chose ; that he would only have to point out the
</p>
<p>man that he considered in his way, and his friends would remove
</p>
<p>him, and would consider it no crime when done for the cause of
</p>
<p>the Confederacy. Clay also, on being told by Montgomery what
</p>
<p>Thompson had said, replied, " That is so ; we are all devoted to our
</p>
<p>cause and ready to go any lengths to do anything in the world
</p>
<p>to serve our cause." Thompson said his friends would do this and
</p>
<p>not let him know anything about it if necessary. That this was
</p>
<p>not mere bragadocio is evident from the fact that Montgomery
</p>
<p>was accepted by Thompson as a confederate in full sympathy with
</p>
<p>himself, and entitled to his fullest confidence.
</p>
<p>Merritt testified that he first heard of the assassination plot in
</p>
<p>October or November, 1864, when he was told by Young, in reply
</p>
<p>to an inquiry of Merritt in regard to a contemplated raid : " We
</p>
<p>have something on the tapis of much more importance than any
</p>

</p>
<p>raids we have made, or can make." He said, " It was determined
</p>
<p>that Old Abe should never be inaugurated." He said they had
</p>
<p>plenty of friends in Washington ; and speaking of Mr. Lincoln, he
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 151
</p>
<p>called him a damned old tyrant. Merritt was afterwards intro-
</p>
<p>duced to George N. Sanders by Colonel Steele, and in the course of
</p>
<p>the conversation that ensued, Steele said, " the damned old tyrant
</p>
<p>will never serve another term if he is elected." Sanders replied,
</p>
<p>"he (Lincoln) would have to keep himself mighty close if he did
</p>
<p>serve another term." In January, 1865, Thompson told Mont-
</p>
<p>gomery that a proposition had been made to him to rid the world
</p>
<p>of the tyrant Lincoln, Stanton, Grant, and some others. He said
</p>
<p>he knew the men that made the proposition to be bold, daring men,
</p>
<p>and able to execute anything they would undertake without regard
</p>
<p>to cost. He said he was in favor of the proposition, but had con-
</p>
<p>cluded to defer giving his answer until he should have consulted
</p>
<p>with his government at Richmond ; and that he was only waiting
</p>
<p>for their approval ; adding that he thought it would be a great
</p>
<p>blessing to the people, both North and South, to have these men
</p>
<p>killed. Beverly Tucker, in a conversation with Montgomery after the
</p>
<p>assassination, recounting the many wrongs the South had received
</p>
<p>at the hands of Mr. Lincoln, said, " that he deserved his death, and
</p>
<p>it was a pity he had not met it long ago ; that it was too bad that
</p>
<p>the boys had not been allowed to act when they wanted to."
</p>
<p>Conover testified that he saw Booth in Montreal about the latter
</p>
<p>part of October, 1864. He was strutting about the St. Lawrence
</p>
<p>Hall, playing billiards, etc., but occasionally was to be seen in con-
</p>
<p>fidential intercourse with Sanders and Thompson.
</p>
<p>Whilst in Canada at this time the plot to assassinate was fully
</p>
<p>decided upon, as will be shown by the " Selby letter" subjoined.
</p>
<p>This letter was picked up in a street car in New York by a couple
</p>
<p>of ladies, one of whom, Mrs. Mary Hudspeth, testified before the
</p>
<p>Commission as follows: " In November last, after the presidential
</p>
<p>election, and on the day that General Butler left New York, as I
</p>
<p>was riding on the Third Avenue cars in New York City, I over-
</p>
<p>heard a conversation of two men. They were talking most earn-
</p>
<p>estly. One of them said he would leave for Washington day after
</p>
<p>to-morrow. The other was going to Newburg or New Berne that

</p>
<p>night. One of the two was a young man with false whiskers. This
</p>
<p>I observed when a jolt of the car pushed hjs hat forward and at the
</p>
<p>same time pushed his whiskers, by which I observed that the front
</p>
<p>152 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>face was darker than it was under the whiskers. Judging by his
</p>
<p>conversation, he was a young man of education. The other, whose
</p>
<p>name was Johnson, was not. I noticed that the hand of the younger
</p>
<p>man was very beautiful, and showed that he had led a life of ease
</p>
<p>and not of labor.
</p>
<p>" They exchanged letters whilst in the car. When the one who
</p>
<p>had the false whiskers put back the letters in his pocket, I saw a
</p>
<p>pistol in his belt. I overheard the younger one say that he would
</p>
<p>leave for Washington the day after to-morrow. The other was
</p>
<p>very angry because it had not fallen on him to go to Washington.
</p>
<p>Both left the cars before I did. After they had left, my daughter,
</p>
<p>who was with me, picked up a letter which was lying on the floor
</p>
<p>of the car, immediately under where they sat, and gave it to me,
</p>
<p>and I, thinking it was mine, as I had letters of my own to post at
</p>
<p>the Nassau Street Post-office, took it without noticing that it was
</p>
<p>not one of my own. When I got to the brokers, where I was
</p>
<p>going with some gold, I noticed an envelope with two letters in it.
</p>
<p>These are the letters, and both were contained in one envelope.
</p>
<p>After I examined the letters and found their character, I took
</p>
<p>them first to General Scott, who asked me to read them to him.
</p>
<p>He said he thought they were of great importance, and asked me
</p>
<p>to take them to General Dix. I did so. The letters are as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>" DEAR Louis: The time has at last come that we have all so wished for, and
</p>
<p>upon you everything depends. As it was decided before you left, we were to cast lots.
</p>
<p>Accordingly we did so, and you are to be the Charlotte Corday of the nineteenth cen-
</p>
<p>tury. When you remember the fearful, solemn vow that was taken by us you will feel
</p>
<p>there is no drawback Abe must die, and now. You can choose your weapons the
</p>
<p>cup, the knife, the bullet. The cup failed us once, and might again. Johnson, who
</p>
<p>will give this, has been like an enraged demon since the meeting because it has not
</p>
<p>fallen upon him to rid the world of the monster. He says the blood of his gray-haired
</p>
<p>father and his noble brother call on him for revenge, and revenge he will have; if he
</p>
<p>cannot wreak it upon the fountain head, he will upon some of the blood-thirsty generals.
</p>
<p>Butler would suit him. As our plans were all concocted and well arranged, we sep-

<p>arated; and as I am writing on my way to Detroit, I will only say that all rests upon
</p>
<p>you. You know where to find your friends. Your disguises are so perfect and com-
</p>

<p>The English gentleman, Harcourt, must not act hastily. Remember he has ten days.

</p>
<p>the fortnight. Inclose this note, together with one of poor Leenea. I will give the
</p>
<p>reason for this when we meet. Return by Johnson. I wish I could go to you, but
</p>
<p>duty calls me to the West; you will probably hear from me in Washington. Sanders
</p>
<p>is doing us no good in Canada.
</p>
<p>" Believe me your brother in love,
</p>
<p>"CHARLES SELBY."
</p>
<p>" ST. Louis, October zist, 1864.
</p>
<p>" DEAREST HUSBAND: Why do you not come home? You left me for ten days
</p>
<p>only, and now you have been from home more than two weeks. In that long time,
</p>
<p>only sent me one short note a few cold words and a check Jor money, which I did
</p>
<p>not require. What has come over you? Have you forgotten your wife and child?
</p>
<p>Baby calls for papa until my heart aches. We are so lonely without you. I have written
</p>
<p>to you again and again, and, as a last resource, yesterday wrote to Charlie, begging
</p>
<p>him to see you and tell you to come home. I am so ill not able to leave my room;
</p>
<p>if I was, I would go to you wherever you were, if in this world. Mamma says I must
</p>
<p>not write any more, as I am too weak. Louis, darling, do not stay away any longer
</p>
<p>from your heart-broken wife,
</p>
<p>" LEENEA."
</p>
<p>General Dix sent these letters to the War Department at Wash-
</p>
<p>ington. They were given to President Lincoln, who put them in
</p>
<p>an envelope, marked it " Assassination," and laid it away in his
</p>
<p>desk, where it was found after his death. Mrs. Hudspeth testified
</p>
<p>that she picked these letters up on the day that General Butler
</p>
<p>left New York. General Butler had orders to leave on the nth
</p>
<p>of November, but upon application got permission to remain until
</p>
<p>the 1 4th. Booth left Washington on the early morning train on
</p>
<p>November I ith, which would put him into New York on the after-
</p>
<p>noon of that day. Here he met his co-conspirator, Johnson, on
</p>
<p>the cars, and in exchanging letters with him, dropped these letters
</p>
<p>without noticing it. The Leenea letter was to have been returned
</p>
<p>by Johnson. He was to leave for Washington on the day after
</p>
<p>to-morrow, which, reckoning from the iith, would be the I3th.
</p>
<p>The hotel register accounts for him again at Washington on the
</p>
<p>1 4th in the early part of the evening. That the young man

<p>described by Mrs. Hudspeth was John Wilkes Booth was shown
</p>
<p>by her recognition of his photograph, shown to her in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of the Commission, when she declared that that was the same
</p>
<p>face. 1
</p>
<p>1 The Charles Selby letter was proven to be in the handwriting of John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth by experts, on comparison, on the trial of John H. Surratt.
</p>
<p>154 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>It was also shown by the testimony of Samuel Knapp Chester, the
</p>
<p>actor, that Booth was in New York about this time, laboring with
</p>
<p>Chester in the most urgent manner to draw him into the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It is true he represented to him that the purpose was to capture the
</p>
<p>President, and carry him a prisoner to Richmond ; that this feat
</p>
<p>was to be performed at Ford's Theatre in Washington, and that
</p>
<p>Chester's part in it would be the easy one of simply opening the
</p>
<p>door of exit on a given signal ; but can any sane man believe that
</p>
<p>this was his purpose ? The impracticability of this proposition could
</p>
<p>not but have been as apparent to Booth as it was to Chester, who
</p>
<p>begged Booth, finally, to never mention the subject to him again.
</p>
<p>It is evident Booth intended to withhold from Chester his real
</p>
<p>purpose until he could get him irrevocably committed to the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. The letter which he had dropped, and which I have
</p>
<p>given above, 'reveals the real purpose of the conspiracy. It
</p>
<p>will be seen by this letter that it was in contemplation at that
</p>
<p>time to act at once, or at least as sqon as a good opportu-
</p>
<p>nity should be found, or could be made. He who was "to be
</p>
<p>the Charlotte Corday of the nineteenth century " had his choice
</p>
<p>as to the weapons he should use ; but whether it should be the
</p>
<p>cup, the knife, or the bullet, it simply meant death. Why was
</p>
<p>not the purpose carried out at that time as arranged for at the
</p>
<p>meeting to which the letter refers? As will be shown by the sub-
</p>
<p>sequent testimony, the assassins were restrained from present action
</p>
<p>by the agents of the rebel government in Canada, who desired to
</p>
<p>have explicit sanction to the arrangements they had made as to
</p>
<p>the compensation, and authority for the expenditure it involved.
</p>
<p>Let us see now how the testimony connects the rebel agents in
</p>
<p>Canada with this meeting that was held in the latter part of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, or first of November, 1864, and with its conclusions, which
</p>
<p>resulted in arrangements for these assassinations. Montgomery
</p>
<p>testified that in January, 1865, Jacob Thompson told him that a
</p>
<p>proposition had been made to him to rid the world of the tyrant
</p>
<p>Lincoln, Stanton, Grant, and some others. The men who had

</p>
<p>made the proposition, he said, he knew to be bold, daring men,
</p>
<p>and able to execute anything they would undertake without regard
</p>
<p>to cost. He said he was in favor of the proposition but had
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 155
</p>
<p>determined to defer his answer until he had consulted with his
</p>
<p>government at Richmond, and he was then only waiting their
</p>
<p>approval, adding that he thought it would be a blessing to the
</p>
<p>people, both North and South, to have these men killed. A few
</p>
<p>days after the. assassination, Montgomery had a conversation with
</p>
<p>Beverly Tucker in Montreal. He said a great deal about the
</p>
<p>wrongs the South had received at the hands of Mr. Lincoln, and
</p>
<p>that he deserved his death, and it was a pity he had not met with
</p>
<p>it long ago. He said " It was too bad that the boys had not been
</p>
<p>allowed to act when they wanted to." Thus we see that " the
</p>
<p>boys " were kept back from the execution of the plot for which
</p>
<p>they had made ready late in October, or early in November, at
</p>
<p>the meeting referred to in the Selby letter, by Thompson and his
</p>
<p>clique, who had concluded to defer it until they should have
</p>
<p>obtained the sanction of their government at Richmond to their
</p>
<p>arrangements, which no doubt involved the expenditure of a large
</p>
<p>sum of money. Montgomery at this time related a portion of the
</p>
<p>conversation with Thompson, given above, to William C. Cleary,
</p>
<p>who was Thompson's confidential secretary, when Cleary told him
</p>
<p>that Booth was one of the men to whom Thompson referred; and
</p>
<p>speaking of the assassination, he said " It was too bad that the
</p>
<p>whole work had not been done," adding, "They had better look
</p>
<p>out; we have not done yet." Cleary told Montgomery during
</p>
<p>this conversation that Booth had been there visiting Thompson
</p>
<p>twice in the winter ; the last time he thought was in December.
</p>
<p>That Cleary was well acquainted with all that Thompson,
</p>
<p>Tucker, and Clay were doing is clear from the relation Ae sus-
</p>
<p>tained to Thompson ; and Thompson himself told Montgomery
</p>
<p>that Cleary was posted in all his affairs, and that if he (Mont-
</p>
<p>gomery) sought him at any time when he was absent, he could
</p>
<p>confide his business to Cleary.
</p>
<p>Conover testified that he called on Thompson, in the early part
</p>
<p>of February, 1865, to make some inquiry about the intended raid
</p>
<p>on Ogdensburg, when Thompson said to him, " There is a bet-
</p>

</p>
<p>ter opportunity, a better chance to immortalize yourself and save
</p>
<p>your country." Conover replied that he was willing to do any-
</p>
<p>thing to save the country. Thompson then said, " Some of our
</p>
<p>156 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>boys are going to play a grand joke on Abe and Andy." Upon
</p>
<p>Conover asking him for a further explanation, he said, " It was to
</p>
<p>kill them, or, rather, to remove them from office." He said, " it
</p>
<p>was only removing them from office ; that the killing of a tyrant
</p>
<p>was no murder." He told Conover then, or subsequently, that
</p>
<p>he had conferred a commission on Booth for this purpose, and
</p>
<p>would commission all who engaged in it, so that whether it suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded or failed, if they escaped to Canada, they could not be
</p>
<p>claimed under the extradition treaty. The Confederate govern-
</p>
<p>ment kept these Canada agents supplied with commissions in
</p>
<p>blank, to be filled up by them at their pleasure, to cover cases
</p>
<p>like these. In this conversation of Thompson with Conover, in
</p>
<p>February, in which he was endeavoring to enlist Conover in the
</p>
<p>plot, he argued that killing a tyrant in such a case was no mur-
</p>
<p>der, and asked him if he had ever read the work entitled, "Kill-
</p>
<p>ing no Murder," a letter addressed by Colonel Titus to Oliver
</p>
<p>Cromwell. Mr. Hamlin was to have been included in the scheme,
</p>
<p>had it been put into execution before the 4th of March. In a sub-
</p>
<p>sequent conversation in April, Mr. Hamlin was omitted, and Vice-
</p>
<p>President Johnson put in his place. We here again see the political
</p>
<p>intent of this scheme, in that it was the office, not the man, that
</p>
<p>was really the subject of the blow.
</p>
<p>Merritt testified to an interview he had with Harper, Caldwell,
</p>
<p>Randall, Charles Holt, and a man called " Texas," at the Queen's
</p>
<p>Hotel, in Toronto, on the 6th of April, 1865. Harper said
</p>
<p>they were "going to the States, and were going to kick up the
</p>
<p>damnedest row that had ever been heard of." He said to Merritt,
</p>
<p>an hour or two afterwards, that " if he (Merritt) did not hear of
</p>
<p>the death of Old Abe, and the Vice-President, and General Dix
</p>
<p>in less than ten days he might put him down as a damned fool.
</p>
<p>We have now had abundant proof that Thompson, Clay, Tucker,
</p>
<p>Sanders, Cleary, etc., were guilty of combining, confederating, and
</p>
<p>conspiring with Booth, and the others, to assassinate Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, William H. Seward, etc. ; that this

<p>plot originated with them, and that they diligently prosecuted
</p>
<p>the work of preparation for it from October, 1864, until its denoue-
</p>
<p>ment, in April, 1865. It appears to have engrossed their minds;
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 157
</p>
<p>it was the great subject of conversation in all of their secret con-
</p>
<p>claves, the great burden of all their thoughts, the very height of
</p>
<p>their ambition.
</p>
<p>Let us next see to what extent the head of the rebel Con-
</p>
<p>federacy, Jefferson Davis, is implicated in it by the evidence. We
</p>
<p>have already seen by his favorable reception of the Alston letter
</p>
<p>and the endorsement he put upon it, that there was nothing in his
</p>
<p>mind or moral nature that revolted at its base, cowardly, and
</p>
<p>dishonorable proposition to " strike at the very heart's blood of
</p>
<p>some of our country's deadliest foes." On the contrary, he refers
</p>
<p>it to his Assistant Secretary of War, marked " For attention."
</p>
<p>Having obtained this index to the state of his mind, we find
</p>
<p>ourselves prepared to receive the testimony of Dr. J. B. Merritt as
</p>
<p>to a letter read by Sanders in a meeting of rebels in Montreal,
</p>
<p>about the middle of February, 1865, at which ten or fifteen per-
</p>
<p>sons were present, amongst whom were Sanders, Colonel Steele,
</p>
<p>Captain Scott, George Young, Byron Hill, Caldwell, Ford, Bene-
</p>
<p>dict, Kirk, and Merritt. Sanders said he had received the letter
</p>
<p>from " the President of our Confederacy " (meaning Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis). The substance of this letter was, that if the confederates
</p>
<p>in Canada and in the States were willing to submit to be governed
</p>
<p>by such a tyrant as Lincoln he did not wish to recognize them as
</p>
<p>friends and associates, and he expressed his approbation of any
</p>
<p>measures they might take to accomplish this object. It is true
</p>
<p>Dr. Merritt did not see Davis's signature to the letter, and would
</p>
<p>not have known it had he seen it, but the letter was first read
</p>
<p>openly by Sanders, and then handed to the others, several of
</p>
<p>whom read it, and none questioned either its author or authen-
</p>
<p>ticity. Colonel Steele, Young, Hill, and Captain Scott read it,
</p>
<p>and no objection was raised. After reading this letter, Sanders
</p>
<p>went on to name a number of persons who were ready and will-
</p>
<p>ing, as he said, to engage in the undertaking to remove the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, Vice-President, the cabinet, and some of the leading generals,
</p>
<p>and said there was any amount of money to accomplish the pur-

</p>
<p>pose. Amongst the persons whom he said thus stood ready to
</p>
<p>engage in this work, he named Booth, George Harper, Charles
</p>
<p>Caldwell, one Randall, and Harrison (by which name Surratt was
</p>
<p>I 5 8 ASSASSINA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>known), and one or two others, one of whom they called "Plug
</p>
<p>Tobacco," or " Port Tobacco." I will here remark that Atzerodt
</p>
<p>was sometimes called by this latter name. Sanders said that Booth
</p>
<p>was heart and soul in this project of assassination, and felt as much
</p>
<p>as any person could feel, for the reason that he was a cousin to
</p>
<p>Beall, who was hung in New York. He said that if they could
</p>
<p>dispose of Mr. Lincoln it would be an easy matter to dispose of
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson ; he was such a drunken 'sot it would be an easy
</p>
<p>matter to dispose of him in some of his drunken revelries.
</p>
<p>When Sanders read the letter he also spoke of Mr. Seward. " I
</p>
<p>inferred," says Dr. Merritt, " it was partially the language of the
</p>
<p>letter. It was, I think, that if the President, Vice-President, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Seward could be disposed of, it would be satisfying the people
</p>
<p>of the North that they (the Southerners) had friends in the North,
</p>
<p>and that peace could be obtained on better terms than could be
</p>
<p>otherwise obtained."
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Booth sent to Chester fifty dollars
</p>
<p>in a letter when trying to get him into the conspiracy, and that at
</p>
<p>their final interview in February, Chester positively refused to have
</p>
<p>anything to do with it, and returned to Booth the fifty dollars he
</p>
<p>had received. Booth took the money, saying at the same time he
</p>
<p>would not do so only he was short of funds. He had told Chester
</p>
<p>that there was plenty of money in the affair, and that if he would
</p>
<p>join he would never want for money again as long as he lived.
</p>
<p>He said, however, as an excuse for taking back the fifty dollars he
</p>
<p>had sent him, that he was very short of funds, and that he, or
</p>
<p>some one, would have to go to Richmond to replenish. Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann testified that John H. Surratt left Washington for Richmond
</p>
<p>on the 2/th of March, and returned on the 3d of April; that on
</p>
<p>his return he showed him nine, or eleven, twenty-dollar gold
</p>
<p>pieces and sixty dollars in currency. Wiechmann was on intimate
</p>
<p>terms of personal intercourse with Surratt, lived in the same house
</p>
<p>with him, and was with him daily when at home, and expressed
</p>
<p>himself as quite certain that he had no gold when he left Wash-

<p>ington. He was not engaged in any business by which he could
</p>
<p>make money. His mother had a very limited income from the
</p>
<p>rent of her farm and tavern, and kept boarders to enable, her to
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 159
</p>
<p>make ends meet ; yet her son was constantly spending money in
</p>
<p>traveling about, and so must have been supplied by his Canada
</p>
<p>friends, whom he visited occasionally; and the chief calls he had
</p>
<p>for expenditure appear to have arisen from his prosecution of their
</p>
<p>schemes. Returning thus from- Richmond to Washington on the
</p>
<p>3d of April, he left the same evening, according to Wiechmann,
</p>
<p>for Canada.
</p>
<p>Conover testified that he saw him in Montreal on the 6th or Jth
</p>
<p>of April, in Mr. Thompson's room, and he learned from their
</p>
<p>conversation that Surratt had just brought despatches from Rich-
</p>
<p>mond to Mr. Thompson. One despatch was from Mr. Benjamin,
</p>
<p>the rebel Secretary of State, and one, which x Conover thought
</p>
<p>was a cipher despatch, from Jefferson Davis. Conover had previ-
</p>
<p>ously been solicited by Thompson to participate in this work of
</p>
<p>assassination, and so was freely admitted to their secret councils.
</p>
<p>After reading these letters from Davis and Benjamin, Thompson,
</p>
<p>laying his hands on them, said, " This makes the thing all right,"
</p>
<p>referring to the assent of the rebel authorities. Mr. Lincoln, Mr.
</p>
<p>Johnson, the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, and the Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, Mr. Seward, Judge Chase, and General Grant were to be
</p>
<p>the victims. Mr. Thompson said this would leave the govern-
</p>
<p>ment entirely without a head ; that there was no provision in the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States by which they could elect
</p>
<p>another President if these men were removed. The long waited
</p>
<p>for authority to use funds which the rebel government had placed
</p>
<p>to the credit of Mr. Thompson having been now secured in the
</p>
<p>despatch from Mr. Benjamin, and his chief, Jefferson Davis, no
</p>
<p>time was lost in putting the ball in motion. Mr. Thompson had
</p>
<p>over six hundred thousand dollars to his credit in the Ontario
</p>
<p>Bank of Montreal, and within two days after receiving these let-
</p>
<p>ters, he drew on his deposit for over two hundred thousand
</p>
<p>dollars. Conover saw Surratt in Montreal from the 6th or /th
</p>
<p>to the 9th of April, and having been admitted to their confidence
</p>
<p>by Thompson, on his receiving the despatches, was accepted by

<p>Surratt as being one of themselves, and so he was under no restraint
</p>
<p>in conversing with Conover. From the whole of his conversation
</p>
<p>Conover inferred that he was to take his part, whatever that might
</p>
<p>160 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>be, in the conspiracy. We have already learned from Merritt's
</p>
<p>testimony, that after Surratt's return to Canada on the 6th of
</p>
<p>April there was an immediate bustle amongst those in Canada
</p>
<p>who were to go to Washington to take part in the plot, and that
</p>
<p>they began to leave on the 8th. The sinews of war having been
</p>
<p>furnished, there was great eagerness, expressed and apparent, to
</p>
<p>be off for the execution of the plot, and great boasting on the
</p>
<p>part of those who went as to what they were going to do. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing set their hired assassins in motion, Thompson and his gang
</p>
<p>stood waiting in a great state of expectancy for the result. Con-
</p>
<p>over testified that on the day before, or the very day of the assas-
</p>
<p>sination, he had a conversation with William C. Cleary about the
</p>
<p>rejoicing in the States over the surrender of Lee and the capture of
</p>
<p>Richmond. Cleary remarked that they " would put the laugh on
</p>
<p>the other side of their mouths in a day or two." "The conspiracy
</p>
<p>was at that time talked of amongst them about as freely as one
</p>
<p>would speak of the weather."
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis received his first intelligence of the assassination
</p>
<p>at Charlotte, N.C., on the I9th of April, in a telegram from Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Breckinridge, as follows :
</p>
<p>"GREENSBORO', April 19, 1865.
</p>
<p>"ffis Excellency President Davis :
</p>
<p>" President Lincoln was assassinated in the theatre at Washington on the night of
</p>
<p>the nth inst. Seward's house was entered on the same night and he was repeatedly
</p>
<p>stabbed, and is probably mortally wounded.
</p>
<p>[Signed] " JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE."
</p>
<p>Davis received this telegram whilst harranguing in his grand-
</p>
<p>iloquent style the crowd that had gathered about him, trying to
</p>
<p>convince them that they were not whipped, and would yet suc-
</p>
<p>ceed. At the conclusion of his speech, he read the telegram to
</p>
<p>his auditors ; and after the manifestations of delight at the news
</p>
<p>had subsided, he made this comment: "Well, if it were done, it
</p>
<p>were better it were well done."
</p>
<p>On the following day, when dining at the house of the witness,

<p>Mr. Lewis F. Bates, with General Breckinridge, who had come to
</p>
<p>pay him a visit, upon General Breckinridge saying in regard to
</p>
<p>the assassination that he regretted it very much that it was very
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. i6l
</p>
<p>unfortunate for the people of the South at that time Davis replied,
</p>
<p>" Well, General, I don't know ; if it were done at all, it were better
</p>
<p>that it were well done ; and if the same had been done to Andy
</p>
<p>Johnson, the beast, and Secretary Stanton the job would then be
</p>
<p>complete." Mark the disappointment of the man, and his bitter
</p>
<p>dissatisfaction with the result of the plot to which he had so
</p>
<p>recently given his sanction ! The telegram informed him of the
</p>
<p>death of President Lincoln at the hands of an assassin, and gave
</p>
<p>him strong grounds to conclude that Secretary Seward had been
</p>
<p>put out of the way in the same way, and was dead ; but this does
</p>
<p>not satisfy him. The work had not been well done because " Andy
</p>
<p>Johnson " still lived, and so they had failed in their purpose to.
</p>
<p>subvert the government. Hear him growl, " It were better it were
</p>
<p>well done ; and if the same had only been done to Andy Johnson,
</p>
<p>the beast, and to Secretary Stanton, the job would then have been
</p>
<p>complete," and we might have taken fresh courage. His co-con-
</p>
<p>spirators in Canada, when informed of the result, gnashed their
</p>
<p>teeth in rage and disappointment. They expressed their regret
</p>
<p>that " the boys had not been allowed to act when they wanted to,"
</p>
<p>and swore " they were not done with them yet." At first their
</p>
<p>attitude was that of defiance, and their expressions of regret at
</p>
<p>their failure to completely carry out their plot were mingled with
</p>
<p>threatenings as to what they would yet do. They boasted while
</p>
<p>the trial was going on that they had their friends at court, and
</p>
<p>were kept posted from day to day as to what was going on. The
</p>
<p>promptness of the government in bringing its prisoners before a
</p>
<p>military commission for trial, making, it obvious that there was
</p>
<p>to be no fooling in the case, together with their continued
</p>
<p>disasters in the field, ending in the speedy collapse of the
</p>
<p>rebellion and the capture of Jefferson Davis, brought them to
</p>
<p>their senses, and to a realization of their own danger; and so
</p>
<p>they at once commenced to destroy all documentary evidence of
</p>
<p>their guilt. They declared in the presence of Montgomery, and
</p>
<p>also of Merritt, that they had destroyed all their papers, lest some

</p>
<p>Yankee should steal them and they should be brought up in a
</p>
<p>possible future trial as evidence against them.
</p>
<p>Now, let us consider what is lacking in this testimony to make
</p>
<p>1 62 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>the evidence of Davis's complicity in this crime complete. Noth-
</p>
<p>ing, manifestly, but the letters referred to in the testimony ; the
</p>
<p>fir^t, that read by Sanders, and credited by him to Davis, inciting
</p>
<p>his friends in Canada to the commission of this crime, and point-
</p>
<p>ing out specifically whom he would have them put out of the way ;
</p>
<p>and the second, carried by Surratt to Thompson, on which Thomp-
</p>
<p>son laid his hand and exclaimed, "This makes the thing all right ! "
</p>
<p>But the absence of this missing link in the chain of evidence against
</p>
<p>him is accounted for, and that in a way that makes the chain
</p>
<p>even stronger, if possible, than if we were able to produce these
</p>
<p>documents.
</p>
<p>His co-conspirators in Canada declare to two witnesses and in
</p>
<p>the presence of a third, George B. Hutchinson, that they have
</p>
<p>destroyed all their papers ; giving as the reason for so doing, the
</p>
<p>fear that some " Yankee son of a b h " might steal them, and
</p>
<p>they should be used as evidence against them.
</p>
<p>They burn their papers and then silently steal away. Exeunt

<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS AND HIS
</p>
<p>ASSOCIATES IN THIS CRIME.
</p>
<p>INASMUCH as the testimony given above so completely sustains
</p>
<p>the charge and specifications made by the government against
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, George N. Sanders, Jacob Thompson, Beverly
</p>
<p>Tucker, Clement C. Clay, William C. Cleary, et al, that had they
</p>
<p>been before the Commission their successful defense could only
</p>
<p>have been made by impeachment of the witnesses against them, I
</p>
<p>will now show that this could not have been done. The principal
</p>
<p>witnesses in this department of the trial, in which the Commission
</p>
<p>was only used as a medium through which to present to the
</p>
<p>world, before whom the charges were made, the evidence on
</p>
<p>which they rested, were Richard Montgomery, Sanford Conover,
</p>
<p>and Dr. James B. Merritt. Richard Montgomery was originally
</p>
<p>a citizen of the city of New York, and was in the employ of the
</p>
<p>government in its department of secret service. He was sent to
</p>
<p>Canada, in the summer of 1864, to acquire information of the
</p>
<p>plans and purposes of the rebels assembled in Canada.
</p>
<p>He acted faithfully toward the government in this service, im-
</p>
<p>parting to it all the information he obtained from time to time
</p>
<p>that was of any importance.
</p>
<p>He was a man of intelligence, good character, and was trusted
</p>
<p>by the government. There was no attempt made before the Com-
</p>
<p>mission to impeach his character for credibility. Of course the
</p>
<p>purpose of his mission to Canada required him to gain the confi-
</p>
<p>dence of the men whose movements he had been sent to watch,
</p>
<p>and a knowledge of whose plans and purposes it was his duty to
</p>
<p>obtain. To do this it was necessary not only that he should con-
</p>
<p>ceal from them his real character and mission, but that he should

<p>164 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>be known to them as a man holding the same opinions and actu-
</p>
<p>ated by the same purposes as themselves. To gain fully their con-
</p>
<p>fidence was necessary to the success and usefulness of his mission.
</p>
<p>This he could only do by making them believe that his sentiments
</p>
<p>and purposes were in unison with their own. Of course this
</p>
<p>involved duplicity and falsehood, yet it is held to be allowable in
</p>
<p>war, because it may be made to contribute to success. A great deal
</p>
<p>of the strategy in war consists in deceiving the enemy ; and if it is
</p>
<p>ever allowable by falsehood to deceive, it was^ certainly allowable by
</p>
<p>falsehood to deceive those who were playing false to their govern-
</p>
<p>ment to accomplish its overthrow. They were secretly concocting
</p>
<p>their schemes for the accomplishment of this purpose ; and to be
</p>
<p>forearmed against them, it was necessary to be forewarned of
</p>
<p>them. This could only be done by this kind of deception, which
</p>
<p>is the same in its nature as that practiced by every spy. But
</p>
<p>spies are used by both parties to the conflict in every war. War
</p>
<p>is in its very nature atrociously wicked ; and so, its ethics cannot
</p>
<p>be made to conform to the accepted morality that ought to govern
</p>
<p>peaceful life. But whilst war is wicked and ought never to be
</p>
<p>provoked, it is yet justifiable when it becomes necessary to the
</p>
<p>preservation of the life of a nation. Upon the aggressor in this
</p>
<p>case the responsibility belongs. On him the guilt falls. A
</p>
<p>defensive war is always justifiable ; and so, according to the code
</p>
<p>of military ethics, everything that is necessary to its successful
</p>
<p>prosecution is also justifiable. This secret service department has
</p>
<p>always been considered one of these indispensable necessities ;
</p>
<p>and it has never been regarded as a just ground of impeachment
</p>
<p>of a man's character for truthfulness and honesty that he has been
</p>
<p>found engaged in this kind of service. Indeed the very nature
</p>
<p>of the duties of this service call for a man of sterling integrity, in
</p>
<p>order that the information obtained through him may have the
</p>
<p>quality of reliability.
</p>
<p>That Richard Montgomery succeeded fully in gaining the con-
</p>
<p>fidence of these Canada rebels is shown by the fact that they made

</p>
<p>him a medium of communication between themselves and the
</p>
<p>Richmond government. His character is further shown by the
</p>
<p>fact that when they paid him one hundred and fifty dollars
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS, 165
</p>
<p>for carrying despatches to Richmond he credited the government
</p>
<p>with it on his expense account. And that he acted faithfully in
</p>
<p>the discharge of his duties to his government is shown by the fact
</p>
<p>that he always submitted the despatches sent by him to the author-
</p>
<p>ities at Washington, where copies of them were kept when they
</p>
<p>were allowed to pass. This is sufficient evidence that he was in a
</p>
<p>position to learn the facts to which he testified, and also presump-
</p>
<p>tive evidence of the credibility of his statements. The force of his
</p>
<p>evidence could only have been broken by undoubted proof that
</p>
<p>he was a man that could not be believed under oath.
</p>
<p>Dr. James B. Merritt was a native of Canada by accident, having
</p>
<p>been born there whilst his parents were there on a visit, but had been
</p>
<p>11 his life a citizen of the State of New York. He went to Canada
</p>
<p>in the spring of 1864, and practiced his profession at Windsor and
</p>
<p>Dumfries. He passed amongst the rebels in Canada as a sym-
</p>
<p>>athizer of the Southern cause, and was accepted by them as a
</p>
<p>good rebel, and was fully taken into their confidences. They
</p>
<p>ilked freely to him, and revealed their plans to him without hesi-
</p>
<p>tation or reserve. His testimony, as we have seen, is very specific,
</p>
<p>md relates to facts of the greatest importance. He testified that
</p>
<p>lis sympathies had always been with his government, and that his
</p>
<p>)bject in dissembling in his intercourse with the Canada rebels
</p>
<p>/as to be able to impart information to the United States govern-
</p>

</p>
<p>require its communication.
</p>
<p>That he did thus voluntarily, and without compensation, furnish
</p>
<p>valuable information to the government was shown. He had thus
</p>
<p>communicated to the Provost Marshal at Detroit the plot to burn
</p>
<p>New York City. It was also shown that he had made an effort to
</p>
<p>communicate the knowledge he had obtained, after the meeting
</p>
<p>of the 6th of April, at which John H. Surratt delivered to Thomp-
</p>
<p>son the despatches he had brought from Richmond, as to the
</p>
<p>parties starting from Canada to Washington to assist in the work
</p>
<p>of assassination. There was sufficient evidence of his loyalty and

</p>
<p>usefulness to the government, and his credibility was not assailed.
</p>
<p>He was a self-constituted secret service man, working without
</p>
<p>compensation, and so entitled to all the more honor.
</p>
<p>1 66 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Sanford Conover, known to the conspirators as James Watson
</p>
<p>Wallace, was born and educated in New York City. He had been
</p>
<p>living in the South for five or six years when the rebellion broke
</p>
<p>out, and was conscripted into the rebel service from near Colum-
</p>
<p>bia, S.C., early in 1863, but was detailed and served as a clerk in
</p>
<p>the rebel war department at Richmond for six months. His sym-
</p>
<p>pathies being on the side of the Union, he embraced the first good
</p>
<p>opportunity he could find to desert, and ran the blockade from
</p>
<p>Richmond, walking most of the way. He rode on the cars as far
</p>
<p>as Hanover Junction, and then walked up through Snickersville
</p>
<p>to Charlestown, and from there to Harper's Ferry, and so on to
</p>
<p>Washington, reaching there in the latter part of December, 1863.
</p>
<p>Whilst in Washington he became a correspondent of the New
</p>
<p>York Tribune, and went to Canada in that capacity in October,
</p>
<p>1864. He testified that he received compensation from the Trib-
</p>
<p>une for his services as correspondent, but had never received
</p>
<p>anything from either the United States or the Confederate govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and that his sympathies had always been with the Union
</p>
<p>cause. The fact that he was not willing to remain in the safe and
</p>
<p>easy position of a clerk in the rebel war department, but chose
</p>
<p>rather to take the hazard of deserting, fully confirms his sworn
</p>
<p>statements as to his political sympathies. He also was a self-con-
</p>
<p>stituted secret service agent of the United States, serving without
</p>
<p>pay. He seems to have been peculiarly successful in working
</p>
<p>himself into the confidence of Davis's agents in Canada, who
</p>
<p>admitted him to their conferences and revealed fully and freely to
</p>
<p>him all of their plans. His testimony is specific and conclusive
</p>
<p>as to their guilt. After he had testified before the Commission
</p>
<p>he was sent back to Canada by the Judge Advocate General to
</p>
<p>get the official report of the St. Albans trial, to be used in evi-
</p>
<p>dence. Arriving in Montreal, he was received in the most friendly
</p>
<p>manner by the conspirators, who had not the least idea that he
</p>
<p>had been a witness before the Commission, and so they went on
</p>
<p>with their confidences as to what they would yet do, declaring

</p>
<p>they were not done yet, etc. But after he had been there a day
</p>
<p>or two, his testimony, which had hitherto been withheld, was
</p>
<p>published in the New York papers, and this revealed to them the
</p>
<p>fact that Sanford Conover was their James Watson Wallace.
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS. 167
</p>
<p>Of course they were like demons in their rage when they saw
</p>
<p>that he had revealed all of their doings. He was at once virtually
</p>
<p>made a prisoner by twelve or fifteen men armed to the teeth, who
</p>
<p>confronted him with his testimony before the Commission. Con-
</p>
<p>over found himself suddenly and unexpectedly placed in a situa-
</p>
<p>tion of great difficulty and danger, escape being impossible, and
</p>
<p>so he denied that he had been before the Commission as a witness.
</p>
<p>They then required him to make a denial under oath, and set a
</p>
<p>lawyer at work to put this disavowal in the most imposing shape,
</p>
<p>whilst they sent for an officer to administer the oath, informing
</p>
<p>Conover that he must appear to the officer not only to be willing,
</p>
<p>but anxious to swear to this disclaimer, in which they make him
</p>
<p>say he had been personated before the Commission by some infa-
</p>
<p>mous scoundrel, who had sworn to a tissue of falsehoods, and telling
</p>
<p>him that if he manifested the least hesitation or unwillingness his life
</p>
<p>would pay the forfeit. He at first, in order to get away from them,
</p>
<p>proposed that he would go to the hotel and prepare the paper that
</p>
<p>they required. O'Donnell told him that would not do, and that he
</p>
<p>would shoot him down like a dog if he did not do as they required.
</p>
<p>Conover still declining, Sanders said to him, "Wallace, you see what
</p>
<p>kind of hands you are in ; I hope you will not be so foolish as to
</p>
<p>refuse." Seeing there was no other way of escape from them, Con-
</p>
<p>over finally did what they required. They then had a lawyer, by
</p>
<p>the name of Kerr, to write out and sign and be qualified to a very
</p>
<p>formal affidavit covering the whole case, to the effect that he was
</p>
<p>present and saw Conover swear to the disavowal referred to, and
</p>
<p>that he did it willingly, and appeared anxious to do so, in justice
</p>
<p>to his own character. These affidavits they at once published to
</p>
<p>the world through the Canada papers, and with them also pub-
</p>
<p>lished the following advertisement, as if from Conover :
</p>
<p>Five hundred dollars reward will be given for the arrest, so that I can bring to
</p>
<p>punishment, in Canada, of the infamous and perjured scoundrel who recently personated
</p>
<p>me under the name of Sanford Conover, and deposed to a tissue of falsehoods before
</p>
<p>the Military Commission at Washington.

<p>JAMES W. WALLACE.
</p>
<p>They also wrote and published over his name, as if from him,
</p>
<p>the following letter :
</p>
<p>1 68 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Evening Telegraph :
</p>
<p>Sir: Please publish my affidavit now handed you, and the subjoined advertisement.
</p>
<p>I will obtain and furnish others for publication hereafter. I will add that if President
</p>
<p>Johnson will send me a safe conduct to go to Washington and return here, I will pro-
</p>
<p>ceed thither and go before the military court and make profert of myself, in order that
</p>
<p>they may see whether or not I am the Sanford Conover who swore as stated.
</p>
<p>MONTREAL, June 8th, 1865. JAMES W. WALLACE.
</p>
<p>Conover not returning to Washington at the time he was ex-
</p>
<p>pected, it was realized that he had been put in jeopardy by the
</p>
<p>premature publication of his testimony, and so it became the duty
</p>
<p>of the United States to follow him with its protecting arm, and he
</p>
<p>was rescued through the intervention of General Dix.
</p>
<p>Being thus rescued, he came again before the Commission and
</p>
<p>testified circumstantially to all of the above facts, and thus exposed
</p>
<p>the effort of the conspirators to break the force of his testimony by
</p>
<p>an affidavit extorted by violence whilst he was virtually a prisoner,
</p>
<p>and supported by that of Kerr, who may not have known that he
</p>
<p>testified to a falsehood, as the coercion was used before he was
</p>
<p>sent for, and still held over the head of Conover by the threat that
</p>
<p>if he manifested the least hesitation or unwillingness before Kerr
</p>
<p>his life would pay the forfeit. The testimony of Conover as to
</p>
<p>the circumstances under which this affidavit was extorted from
</p>
<p>him, was substantiated, as also his character, by Nathan Auser,
</p>
<p>who testified as follows :
</p>
<p>"I reside in New York, and am acquainted with Sanford Con-
</p>
<p>over, who has just testified. I have known him eight or ten years ;
</p>
<p>his character for integrity and usefulness is good as far as I know.
</p>
<p>I recently accompanied him to Montreal, in Canada, and was
</p>
<p>present at an interview which he had with Beverly Tucker, George
</p>
<p>N. Sanders, and that clique of rebel conspirators.
</p>
<p>" After we went into O'Donnell's room, at Montreal, Mr.
</p>
<p>Cameron gave each of us a paper containing the evidence Mr.
</p>
<p>Conover gave here in Washington before the Commission, when
</p>
<p>he denied it. They told him he must sign a written paper to that

</p>
<p>effect, and if he did not he would not leave the room alive.
</p>
<p>O'Donnell said that he would shoot him like a dog if he did not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Conover was first going to his hotel to write the paper; at
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS. 169
</p>
<p>first they agreeed to this, but when they got as far as St. Lawrence
</p>
<p>Hall they made up their minds they would not let him do this
</p>
<p>himself, and when they went upstairs at St. Lawrence Hall they
</p>
<p>would not let me go up. There were, I think, twelve or fifteen of
</p>
<p>the conspirators together ; among them Sanders, Tucker, O'Don-
</p>
<p>nell, General Carroll, Fallen, and Cameron. They all accompanied
</p>
<p>him for the purpose of preventing his escape and obliging him to
</p>
<p>do what they required."
</p>
<p>Thus was their attempt to break the force of Conover's testi-
</p>
<p>mony by fraud and violence exposed, and they were left in a
</p>
<p>more pitiable condition than if they had not made the effort.
</p>
<p>Conover stands in a better light as a witness than he did before
</p>
<p>it was made.
</p>
<p>The question will naturally suggest itself to the intelligent reader,
</p>
<p>why, if these men knew of the purpose and preparations referred
</p>
<p>to as the result of the reception of the despatches from Richmond
</p>
<p>at the hands of Surratt, did they not inform the authorities at
</p>
<p>Washington? Accepting the fact that they had all the knowledge
</p>
<p>on this subject which is implied in their testimony, and that they
</p>
<p>were loyal to the government, as they declared themselves to be
</p>
<p>under oath, this would seem plainly to have been their duty.
</p>
<p>The counsel for the defense were not slow to perceive this fact,
</p>
<p>and sought to weaken their standing before the Commission by ask-
</p>
<p>ing them this very question. The answers elicited, however, only
</p>
<p>served to strengthen their testimony. In answer, Dr. Merritt stated
</p>
<p>as follows: "On Saturday the 8th of April I was at Gait, five
</p>
<p>miles from which place Harper's mother lives, and I ascertained
</p>
<p>there that Harper and Caldwell had stopped there and had started
</p>
<p>for the States. When I found they had left for Washington, pro-
</p>
<p>bably for the purpose of assassinating the President, I went to
</p>
<p>Squire Davidson, a justice of the peace, to give information and
</p>
<p>have them stopped.
</p>
<p>" He said that the thing was too ridiculously or supremely
</p>
<p>absurd to take any notice of ; it would only appear foolish to give

</p>
<p>such information and cause arrests to be made on such grounds ;
</p>
<p>it was so inconsistent that no person would believe it ; and he
</p>
<p>declined to issue any process. I then called upon the judge of
</p>
<p>I JO ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>the court of assizes, made my statement to him, and he said I
</p>
<p>should have to go to the grand jury."
</p>
<p>In his answer it is made to appear that Dr. Merritt made an earn-
</p>
<p>est effort to have this information imparted to the government, and
</p>
<p>did all that we can reasonably think that he ought to have done.
</p>
<p>His testimony is corroborated by that of Squire Davidson, who
</p>
<p>made a statement to the government after the assassination, of this
</p>
<p>interview that Merritt had sought with him and of the purpose of
</p>
<p>it ; and it was upon this information that Dr. Merritt was brought
</p>
<p>before the Commission as a witness.
</p>
<p>In answer to this question, Conover testified as follows : " I
</p>
<p>communicated to the New York Tribune the contemplated assas-
</p>
<p>sination of the President, and the intended raid on Ogdensburg.
</p>
<p>The assassination plot they declined to publish because they had
</p>
<p>been accused of publishing sensational stories. The assassination
</p>
<p>plot I communicated in March last, and also in February, I think,
</p>
<p>certainly before the 4th of March. My reasons for communi-
</p>
<p>cating the intended assassinations to the Tribune, and not directly
</p>
<p>to the government, was that I supposed that the relations between
</p>
<p>the editor and proprietor of the Tribune and the government were
</p>
<p>such that they would lose no time in giving information on the
</p>
<p>subject. In regard to the conspiracy, as well as to some other
</p>
<p>secrets of the rebels in Canada, I requested Mr. Gay, of the Trib-
</p>
<p>une, to give information to the government, and I believe he has
</p>
<p>formerly done so."
</p>
<p>Here again we find that the witness Conover fulfilled his duty,
</p>
<p>which, under the circumstances in which his testimony places him
</p>
<p>in regard to the matter, any reasonable man could have required
</p>
<p>of him. And his position was also strengthened before the Com-
</p>
<p>mission by the answer elicited.

<p>Lewis F. Bates, who testified as to Jefferson Davis's remarks to
</p>

<p>the dinner table, was a resident of Charlotte, N.C., where he had
</p>
<p>been for a little over four years. He was superintendent of the
</p>
<p>Southern Express Company for the State of North Carolina. He
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS. 171
</p>
<p>was a native of Massachusetts. The responsible position in which
</p>
<p>we find him vouches for his standing as a reliable man amongst
</p>
<p>those who knew him. His character was further established
</p>
<p>before the Commission by the 'testimony of a witness who was
</p>
<p>acquainted with him, James E. Russell, as follows : " I reside
</p>
<p>in Springfield, Mass. I have known Lewis F. Bates for about
</p>
<p>twenty-five years. For the last five years I have not known any-
</p>
<p>thing of his whereabouts, until I learned from him that he had
</p>
<p>been living in Charlotte, N.C. He was in business as a baggage-
</p>
<p>master on the Western Railroad, Massachusetts, while I was con-
</p>
<p>ductor, and I never heard anything against his reputation for
</p>
<p>truth."
</p>
<p>Burton N. Harrison, private secretary to Jefferson Davis, in an
</p>
<p>article entitled, " An Extract from a Narrative, written not for
</p>
<p>publication, but for the entertainment of my children only," pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the Century Magazine, New Series, Vol. V., pp. 136 and
</p>
<p>137, says: " In pursuance of the scheme of Stanton and Holt to
</p>
<p>fasten upon Mr. Davis charges of a guilty foreknowledge of, and
</p>
<p>participation in, the murder of Mr. Lincoln, Bates was afterwards
</p>
<p>carried to Washington and made to testify (before the military
</p>
<p>tribunal, I believe, where the murderers were on trial) to some-
</p>
<p>thing about that speech [referring to Davis's speech at Charlotte,
</p>
<p>N.C.]. As I recollect the reports of the testimony published at
</p>
<p>the time, they made the witness say that Mr. Davis had approved
</p>
<p>of the assassination, either explicitly or by necessary implication ;
</p>
<p>and that he added, ' If it was to be done it is well it was done
</p>
<p>quickly,' or words to that effect. If any such testimony was
</p>
<p>given it is false and without foundation ; no comment upon or
</p>
<p>reference to the assassination was made in that speech. I have
</p>
<p>been told the witness has always stoutly insisted he never testified
</p>
<p>to anything of the kind, but that what he said was altogether
</p>
<p>perverted in the publication made by the rascals in Washington.
</p>
<p>Col. William Preston Johnston tells me he has seen another version
</p>
<p>of the story, and thinks Bates is understood to have fathered it in a

</p>
<p>publication made in some newspaper after his visit to Washington ;
</p>
<p>it represents Bates as saying that the words above mentioned as
</p>
<p>imputed to Mr. Davis were used by him, not, indeed, in the speech
</p>
<p>1/2 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>I have described, but in a conversation with Johnston at Bates's
</p>
<p>house. Johnston assures me that, in that shape, too, the story is
</p>
<p>false ; that Mr. Davis never used such words in his presence, or
</p>
<p>any words at all like them. He adds that Mr. Davis remarked
</p>
<p>to him at Bates's house, with reference to the assassination, that
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln would have been much more useful to the Southern
</p>
<p>States than Andrew Johnson, the successor, was likely to be ; and
</p>
<p>I myself heard Mr. Davis express the same opinion at that period."
</p>
<p>On p. 145, same article, he says: " It was at that cavalry camp we
</p>
<p>first heard of the proclamation offering one hundred thousand
</p>
<p>dollars for the capture of Mr. Davis upon the charge, invented
</p>
<p>by Stanton and Holt, of participation in the plot to murder Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln. Colonel Pritchard had himself just received it; and con-
</p>
<p>siderately handed a printed copy of the proclamation to Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis, who read it with a composure unruffled by any feeling
</p>
<p>other than scorn. The money was several years afterwards paid
</p>
<p>to the captors. Stanton and Holt, lawyers both, very well knew
</p>
<p>that Mr. Davis could never be convicted upon an indictment for
</p>
<p>treason, but were determined to hang him anyhow, and were in
</p>
<p>search of a pretext for doing so." And again in conclusion he
</p>
<p>says, " To have been a prisoner in the hands of the government of
</p>
<p>the United States, and not to have been brought to trial upon any
</p>
<p>of the charges against him, is sufficient refutation of them all. It
</p>
<p>indicates that the people in Washington knew the accusations could
</p>
<p>not be sustained." Had Mr. Harrison adhered to his original pur-
</p>
<p>pose of simply entertaining his children with this article it would have
</p>
<p>been much to his credit. It seems, however, that upon reading
</p>
<p>and re-reading it he came to regard it as too clever a production,
</p>
<p>and pf too much public importance, to be restricted to so narrow a
</p>
<p>sphere, and so he publishes this lengthy extract from it in the
</p>
<p>Century. The article, as it appears in the Century, is mostly
</p>
<p>devoted to an account of the flight of Mr. Davis and his family
</p>
<p>from Richmond, and their progress southward until captured.
</p>
<p>We have simply extracted from this article that part which from

</p>
<p>the nature of the subject claims our attention, as it relates to the
</p>
<p>testimony of Lewis F. Bates before the Commission. Let us first
</p>
<p>notice Mr. Harrison's assumption that Secretary Stanton and Gen-
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS. 173
</p>
<p>eral Holt had concocted a scheme to fasten on Jefferson Davis a
</p>
<p>guilty complicity in the murder of Mr. Lincoln. This charge Mr.
</p>
<p>Harrison makes with brazen effrontery, but does not bring a scin-
</p>
<p>tilla of evidence to sustain it. Here are two high officers of the
</p>
<p>government, the Secretary of War, and the head of the Depart-
</p>
<p>ment of Military Justice, men of unsullied personal and official
</p>
<p>reputation, charged with concocting a scheme to take the life of
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis on a trumped-up charge, and sustained by false
</p>
<p>testimony. The Secretary of War, as was his duty, employed
</p>
<p>every agency in his power to ferret out the conspirators, and in
</p>
<p>the progress of his investigations turned over to the Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate General all the facts that came to his knowledge, together
</p>
<p>with the names of the persons by whom they could be proven.
</p>
<p>These persons were brought before the Judge Advocate and care-
</p>
<p>fully examined as to what they knew, and so became witnesses
</p>
<p>before the Commission, when they were found to have knowledge
</p>
<p>of facts bearing on the great crime that had been committed.
</p>
<p>That any witness was in any manner coerced, or required to
</p>
<p>render testimony that had been prepared for him by these officers
</p>
<p>as charged, will only be believed by those who are ignorant of the
</p>
<p>personal and official character of these noble, patriotic, men, or
</p>
<p>those who, like Mr. Harrison, are willing to thus calumniate on
</p>
<p>their own responsibility. That Mr. Bates was testifying under any
</p>
<p>manner of duress will not be believed by any member of the Com-
</p>
<p>mission who is yet living, and who can recall the appearance and
</p>
<p>manner of the witness in giving his testimony. He was evidently
</p>
<p>telling just what he had seen and heard, and did it willingly. The
</p>
<p>charge of Mr. Harrison, that Bates was carried to Washington and
</p>
<p>made to testify, rests simply on the authority of Mr. Burton N.
</p>
<p>Harrison, whilom private secretary to Jefferson Davis, unsustained
</p>
<p>by any evidence.
</p>
<p>The evidence given by Bates was taken down, as delivered, by a
</p>
<p>stenographer, and read to him before he was discharged, and its
</p>
<p>correctness admitted by him, as witnessed by his signature. This

</p>
<p>testimony was published in the newspapers, and also in the official
</p>
<p>record of the trial. What excuse, then, can Mr. Harrison give for
</p>
<p>quoting it as he recollected it, and so failing to give anything like
</p>
<p>a correct version of his testimony?
</p>
<p>174 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>The testimony of Bates was that Mr. Davis, whilst addressing
</p>
<p>the people from the steps of Bates's house, received a telegram
</p>
<p>from General Breckinridge informing him of the assassination of
</p>
<p>President Lincoln, and that an attempt had been made on the life
</p>
<p>of William H. Seward, and that he was repeatedly stabbed and
</p>
<p>probably mortally wounded, and that in concluding his speech he
</p>
<p>read the telegram aloud, and made this remark, " If it were to be
</p>
<p>done it were better it were well done." The witness added, " I am
</p>
<p>quite sure that these are the words he used." And again, " A
</p>
<p>day or two afterward Jefferson Davis and John C. Breckinridge
</p>
<p>were present at my house, when the assassination of the President
</p>
<p>was the subject of conversation. In speaking of it, John C. Breck-
</p>
<p>inridge remarked to Davis that he regretted it very much, that it
</p>
<p>was very unfortunate for the people of the South at that time.
</p>
<p>Davis replied, ' Well, General, I don't know ; if it were to be done
</p>
<p>at all, it were better that it were well done, and if the same had
</p>
<p>been done to Andy Johnson, the beast, and to Secretary Stanton,
</p>
<p>the job would then be complete.' No remark was made at all as
</p>
<p>to the criminality of the act, and from the expression used by
</p>
<p>John C. Breckinridge I drew the conclusion that he simply
</p>
<p>regarded it as unfortunate for the people of the South at that
</p>
<p>time." Here is Bates's testimony as it stands recorded, and was
</p>
<p>also published at the time. 1 Why did not Mr. Harrison address
</p>
<p>himself to this testimony instead of giving his version of it from
</p>
<p>memory, and confounding it with newspaper reports as to what
</p>
<p>Bates claimed to have been his testimony, and thus finding an
</p>
<p>opportunity to substitute Col. William P. Johnston for General
</p>
<p>Breckinridge, thus contradicting it through Johnston? General
</p>
<p>Breckinridge was the only man who could have contradicted
</p>
<p>Bates's testimony. If he ever did do this it has not come to
</p>
<p>the knowledge of the writer. Bates's testimony cannot be set
</p>
<p>aside in the manner attempted by Mr. Harrison.

</p>
<p>1 It is highly improbable that the witness would have given false testimony as to
</p>
<p>this conversation between Davis and General Breckinridge because of the certainty of
</p>
<p>its contradiction by the latter.
</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT WITNESSES AGAINST DAVIS. 175
</p>
<p>him thus far in the murder of Mr. Lincoln, was only made upon
</p>
<p>the evidence before it, and which we have already presented at
</p>
<p>length.
</p>
<p>It was not a trumped-up charge for the purpose of gratifying
</p>
<p>malice, or with a view to the taking of the life of Mr. Davis un-
</p>
<p>justly in revenge, but a charge made in good faith, and sustained
</p>
<p>by evidence that has never been overthrown.
</p>
<p>The conclusion of Mr. Harrison, that the government conceded
</p>
<p>that its charge against Mr. Davis was unfounded in that it did not
</p>
<p>prosecute it when i.t had him in custody as a prisoner, is a non
</p>
<p>sequitor.
</p>
<p>The rebellion was declared to be at an end shortly after the trial
</p>
<p>of the assassins. The proclamation of martial law ceased with the
</p>
<p>proclamation of peace. Civil law took the place of martial law with
</p>
<p>the issuance of the proclamation that the rebellion was at an end.
</p>
<p>The work of reconstruction belonged to the political department
</p>
<p>of the government, and the benign policy of condoning the past,
</p>
<p>and only securing guarantees for the future was wisely adopted ;
</p>
<p>this security is found in the fourteenth amendment to the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution, and illustrates the tempering of justice with rfiercy as had
</p>
<p>never been before done in the history of the race. It can never
</p>
<p>be claimed that the government abandoned its charge made
</p>
<p>against any of these parties because it did not bring them to
</p>
<p>trial when it had it in its power to do so. The charges as made
</p>
<p>have never been withdrawn. They stand in the records of that
</p>
<p>trial, and the evidence on which the charges were based has been
</p>
<p>presented to the world and the question of the guilt or innocence
</p>
<p>of the parties has been referred to the decision of an enlightened
</p>
<p>and impartial public sentiment and to the judgment of the world.
</p>
<p>But we will now consider the credibility of this testimony from
</p>
<p>another standpoint. Here we have three witnesses, Conover,
</p>
<p>Montgomery, and Merritt, strangers to each other, testifying as
</p>
<p>to the facts known to each one separately, and they completely
</p>
<p>corroborate each other. There could have been no possible col-

</p>
<p>lusion, and yet their testimony is the same. It is, as it were, the
</p>
<p>continued story of one man, who is consistent with himself at
</p>
<p>every point. The purposes of the conspirators and their plans
</p>
<p>176 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>through a period of several months are the same, whether, they
</p>
<p>come to us through Conover, Montgomery, or Merritt. " Out of
</p>
<p>the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." The assassina-
</p>
<p>tion plot was that which engrossed their thoughts. They were
</p>
<p>continually scheming for its accomplishment ; it was the thing dear
</p>
<p>to their hearts and was the constant theme of their tongues.
</p>
<p>The witnesses corroborate each other in showing that this was
</p>
<p>the case. In regard to the fact testified to by both Montgomery
</p>
<p>and Merritt, that the conspirators stated they were destroying their
</p>
<p>papers, we have the additional testimony of George B. Hutchinson,
</p>
<p>who testified as follows: "On the 2d of June, and on the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of the 3d, 1865, I saw Dr. Merritt in conversation with
</p>
<p>Beverly Tucker, at St. Lawrence Hall, in Montreal. I heard
</p>
<p>Beverly Tucker say in reply to a remark of Dr. Merritt, that he
</p>
<p>had burned all the letters for fear that some ' Yankee son of a
</p>
<p>b h ' might steal them out of his room and use them in testimony
</p>
<p>against him. They were at the time speaking about this trial, and
</p>
<p>the charges against them. They were talking to Dr. Merritt as to
</p>
<p>one to whom they gave their confidence."
</p>
<p>Who, in the light of all the facts given in this testimony, which
</p>
<p>fulfills all the conditions, on down to the crucial test of credibility
</p>
<p>that of the concurrence of three witnesses, who were entire
</p>
<p>strangers to each other, in the statement of all the essential facts
</p>
<p>can doubt that all these men implicated in the charge and specifi-
</p>
<p>cations preferred by the government were equally guilty with John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt and John Wilkes Booth of the assassination accomplished,
</p>
<p>and that attempted ; as, also, of the others planned. It matters
</p>
<p>not that for good and sufficient reasons they were never called to
</p>
<p>account by the government, when it had it in its power to do so ;
</p>
<p>they yet stand, and must forever stand, condemned by an intelli-
</p>
<p>gent and candid world. If their guilt is not proven I do not see

<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>A CRITICISM OF NICOLAY AND HAY.
</p>
<p>NlCOLAY and Hay in their " Life of Lincoln " (see Century
</p>
<p>Magazine for January, 1890, p. 439), say: "The surviving con-
</p>
<p>spirators, with the exception of John H. Surratt, were tried by a
</p>
<p>military commission sitting in Washington in the months of May
</p>
<p>and June.
</p>
<p>"The charges against them specified that they were ' incited and
</p>
<p>encouraged ' to treason and murder by Jefferson Davis and the
</p>
<p>Confederate emissaries in Canada. This was not proven on the
</p>
<p>trial ; the evidence bearing on the case showed frequent communi-
</p>
<p>cation between Canada and Richmond and the Booth coterie in
</p>
<p>Washington, and some transactions in drafts at the Montreal Bank
</p>
<p>where Jacob Thompson and Booth kept their accounts. It was
</p>
<p>shown by the sworn testimony of a reputable witness that Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis at Greensboro', on hearing of the assassination, expressed his
</p>
<p>gratification at the news ; but this, so far from proving any direct
</p>
<p>complicity in the crime, would rather prove the opposite, as a
</p>
<p>conscious murderer usually conceals his malice. Against all the
</p>
<p>rest, the facts we have briefly stated were abundantly proved," etc.
</p>
<p>In a foot-note they add : " When captured by General Wilson he
</p>
<p>(Jefferson Davis) affected to think he cleared himself of suspicion
</p>
<p>in this regard by saying that Johnson was more objectionable to
</p>
<p>him than Lincoln not noticing that the conspiracy contem-
</p>
<p>plated the murder of both." From this there would seem to have
</p>
<p>been some doubt in the mind of the writer on the question of
</p>
<p>Davis's innocence. Again, they say: "Davis, in speaking to Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Wilson about this charge, said that he regarded the charge of
</p>
<p>treason as likely to give him more trouble than this." Of course
</p>
<p>he relied on the sagacity of his co-conspirators in Canada for the

</p>
<p>i;8 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>destruction of all documentary evidence against him, and so he felt
</p>
<p>that his guilt could not be proven. The writer has the highest
</p>
<p>regard for these authors, and a very high appreciation of the man-
</p>
<p>ner in which they have handled their great subject. The history
</p>
<p>of several of the last years of the life of Abraham Lincoln is
</p>
<p>inseparably linked with the history of his country, and that the
</p>
<p>most momentous period of its history. To do justice to the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of their memoir required a vast amount of the most painstak-
</p>
<p>ing research, and a general overhauling of the political history of
</p>
<p>the country over a period of a dozen or more years.
</p>
<p>This was a work of great labor, involving a careful examination
</p>
<p>of a multitude of documents and records. They had that familiar,
</p>
<p>personal acquaintance with Mr. Lincoln, growing out of their offi-
</p>
<p>cial relations to him, that enables them to form a correct estimate
</p>
<p>of his intellectual and moral character, and of the innermost feel-
</p>
<p>ings and governing motives of his life. They have done their
</p>
<p>work faithfully and well, and have presented Mr. Lincoln in his
</p>
<p>true character, and made manifest his wonderful astuteness, his
</p>
<p>wisdom, forbearance, charity, gentleness, and toleration toward his
</p>
<p>fellowmen, as well as his firmness and fidelity to the right, to the
</p>
<p>gaze of an admiring world. It is with feelings of regret that faith-
</p>
<p>fulness to my purpose of giving a true history of the great con-
</p>
<p>spiracy which culminated in his death requires me to take issue
</p>
<p>with them in their treatment of this case. It will be evident to all
</p>
<p>my readers who have read and carefully considered the evidence
</p>
<p>presented by the government to sustain its charge against Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son Davis and his confederates in Canada, that authors who were
</p>
<p>familiar with it could never have come to the conclusion so confi-
</p>
<p>dently expressed by these authors when they say, " This was not
</p>
<p>proved on the trial." The abstract of the evidence which they
</p>
<p>then proceed to give, shows an equal degree of unfamiliarity with
</p>
<p>it. It consists merely in a confused jumbling of a few compara-
</p>
<p>tively unimportant facts, leaving unnoticed and untouched the
</p>
<p>great mass of relevant and conclusive testimony that I have pre-
</p>

</p>
<p>sented. The account which they give of the manner in which
</p>
<p>Davis received the news of the assassination does not consist at all
</p>
<p>with the testimony. They say: " It was shown by the sworn testi-
</p>
<p>A CRITICISM OF NICOLA Y AND HAY. 179
</p>
<p>mony of a reputable witness that Jefferson Davis at Greensboro',
</p>
<p>on hearing of the assassination, expressed his gratification at the
</p>
<p>news ; but this, so far from proving any direct complicity in the
</p>
<p>crime, would rather prove the opposite, as a conscious murderer
</p>
<p>usually conceals his malice."
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis received the news of the assassination at Char-
</p>
<p>lotte, not at Greensboro'. Breckinridge telegraphed the news to
</p>
<p>him from Greensboro'. It is the testimony of Lewis F. Bates to
</p>
<p>which they refer. But my readers, who have so lately read Mr.
</p>
<p>Bates' testimony, I am sure will not recognize it in the account
</p>
<p>which these authors give of it ; and as they have failed in giving
</p>
<p>us a true account of the testimony, we cannot wonder if they draw
</p>
<p>an erroneous conclusion from it inferentially. It will be remem-
</p>
<p>bered that all the expressions that escaped from the rebel chief on
</p>
<p>that occasion were those of deep-felt dissatisfaction and bitter
</p>
<p>disappointment. A free rendering of his language on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion would amount to just this : " It might just as well not have
</p>
<p>been done at all, since the job was not thoroughly done. If Andy
</p>
<p>Johnson, the beast, and Stanton had only been included, the job
</p>
<p>would then have been complete. It would have been of some
</p>
<p>account to us." His whole speech and demeanor on that occasion
</p>
<p>show him to have been a co-conspirator, fully aware of the scope
</p>
<p>of their plot, and displeased at the incompleteness of the " job."
</p>
<p>Again, on page 432 of the Century for January, 1890, we find
</p>
<p>the following: "He (Booth) was a fanatical secessionist; had
</p>
<p>assisted at the capture of John Brown, and had imbibed, at Rich-
</p>
<p>mond and other Southern cities where he had played, a furious
</p>
<p>spirit of partisanship against Mr. Lincoln and the Union party.
</p>
<p>"After the re-election of Mr. Lincoln, which rung the knell of
</p>
<p>the insurrection, Booth, like many of the secessionists North and
</p>
<p>South, was stung to the quick by disappointment. He visited
</p>
<p>Canada, consorted with the rebel emissaries there, and at last
</p>
<p>whether or not at their instigation cannot certainly be said con-
</p>
<p>ceived a scheme to capture the President and take him to Rich-

</p>
<p>mond. He spent a great part of the autumn and winter inducing
</p>
<p>a small number of loose fish of secession sympathies to join him
</p>
<p>in this fantastic enterprise. He seemed always well supplied with
</p>
<p>180 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>money, and talked largely of his speculations in oil as a source of
</p>
<p>income ; but his agent afterwards testified that he never realized a
</p>
<p>dollar from that source that his investments, which were incon-
</p>
<p>siderable, were a total loss. The winter passed away, and nothing
</p>
<p>was accomplished. On the 4th of March, Booth was at the
</p>
<p>capitol, and created a disturbance by trying to force his way
</p>
<p>through the line of policemen who guarded the passage through
</p>
<p>which the President passed to the east front of the building. His
</p>
<p>intentions at this time are not known. He afterwards said he lost
</p>
<p>an excellent chance of killing the President that day. There are
</p>
<p>indications in the evidence given on the trial of the conspirators
</p>
<p>that they suffered some great disappointment in their schemes in
</p>
<p>the latter part of March ; and a letter from Arnold to Booth, dated
</p>
<p>2 /th March, showed that some of them had grown timid of the
</p>
<p>consequences of their contemplated enterprise, and were ready to
</p>
<p>give it up. He advised Booth, before going farther, to go and see
</p>
<p>how it would be taken at R d. But timid as they might be
</p>
<p>by nature, the whole group was so completely under the ascen-
</p>
<p>dency of Booth that they did not dare disobey him when in his
</p>
<p>presence ; and after the surrender of Lee, in an excess of malice
</p>
<p>and rage which was akin to madness, he called them together and
</p>
<p>assigned each his part in the new crimes [the italics are ours],
</p>
<p>the purpose of which had arisen suddenly in his mind out of the
</p>
<p>ruins of the abandoned abduction scheme. This plan was as
</p>
<p>brief and simple as it was horrible. Powell, alias Payne, the stal-
</p>
<p>wart, brutal, simple-minded boy from Florida, was to murder
</p>
<p>Seward ; Atzerodt, the comic villain of the drama, was assigned
</p>
<p>to remove Andrew Johnson ; Booth reserved for himself the most
</p>
<p>difficult and most conspicuous role of the tragedy ; it was Herold's
</p>
<p>duty to attend him as a page, and aid in his escape."
</p>
<p>In this rather long extract, in which the situation is pictured
</p>
<p>with a facile pen, there are are two assumptions that are wholly
</p>
<p>irreconcilable with the evidence.
</p>
<p>The first is, that the plot was at first to capture the President and
</p>

</p>
<p>carry him to Richmond, whether with or without the approbation
</p>
<p>of the Canada conspirators, our author's assume cannot be known.
</p>
<p>The evidence does not show that such a plot was really enter-

<p>A CRITICISM OF NICOLA Y AND HAY. i 8 I
</p>
<p>tained either by Booth or his co-conspirators in Canada. Con-
</p>
<p>over testified that he heard this scheme discussed at a meeting of
</p>
<p>the latter in February ; but it does not appear that it was ever
</p>
<p>considered practicable, or was really entertained by them. The
</p>
<p>proposition was too quixotic to receive the serious consideration
</p>
<p>of rational, intelligent men. All the testimony in regard to the
</p>
<p>Canada conspirators shows that they were all the time from Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, 1864, devoting all their thoughts to securing the assassination,
</p>
<p>not only of the President, but also of the others named in the
</p>
<p>charge and specifications, and that by nothing but the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of all of these men could the political end which they sought
</p>
<p>be secured. This assumption of our authors is shown by the
</p>
<p>testimony to be wholly untenable. The next assumption to
</p>
<p>which I take exceptions is equally untenable in the light which
</p>
<p>the testimony throws on the subject. It is, that the assassination
</p>
<p>was the result of a hasty impulse of rage and disappointment,
</p>
<p>akin to madness ; that a new crime was thus conceived, which
</p>
<p>grew out of the ruins of the abduction plot, which I have already
</p>
<p>sufficiently shown was never entertained by any of the parties. So
</p>
<p>far from being the result of a hasty impulse, the testimony clearly
</p>
<p>proves that it had been long entertained, and that they had all been
</p>
<p>planning, preparing, and arranging for its execution for months.
</p>
<p>It is greatly to be regretted that such popular, and usually
</p>
<p>reliable, authors, should have allowed themselves on this occasion
</p>
<p>to write thus loosely, and express opinions and conclusions so
</p>
<p>much at variance with the testimony. It tends to obscure the truth
</p>
<p>of history, and to the formation of an erroneous public opinion.
</p>
<p>The conclusion at which I have arrived, and expressed without
</p>
<p>hesitation, as to the guilt of Davis and his Canada Cabinet in this
</p>
<p>matter, stands untouched by that expressed by these authors,
</p>
<p>because it is manifest that they not only had never studied, but
</p>
<p>were quite unfamiliar with, the evidence on which alone a right
</p>
<p>judgment can be based.
</p>
<p>All I ask of my readers is, that they will scan carefully what I

<p>JACOB THOMPSON'S BANK ACCOUNT. WHAT BECAME OF THE
</p>
<p>MONEY?
</p>
<p>THE testimony before the Commission developed the fact that
</p>
<p>the Canada Cabinet was kept well supplied with money, and that
</p>
<p>Jacob Thompson was the Judas that carried the bag.
</p>
<p>His treasury was kept replenished by Southern bills of exchange
</p>
<p>on Liverpool. Robert Anson Campbell, first teller of the Ontario
</p>
<p>Bank of Montreal, Canada, appeared before the Commission and
</p>
<p>gave testimony as to Thompson's transactions with his bank as
</p>
<p>follows: "I know Mr. Jacob Thompson very well. His account
</p>
<p>with the Ontario Bank I hold in my hand. It commenced May
</p>
<p>3Oth, 1864, and closed April nth, 1865. Prior to May 3Oth,
</p>
<p>he left with us sterling exchange, drawn on the rebel agents at
</p>
<p>Liverpool, for collection. The first advice we had was May 3Oth,
</p>
<p>when there was placed to his credit 2,061 ijs. and i^d., and
</p>
<p>.20,618 us. 4^., amounting to $109,965.63. The aggregate
</p>
<p>amount of the credits is $649,873.28, and there is a balance still
</p>
<p>left to his credit of $1,766.23; all the rest has been drawn out.
</p>
<p>Since about the ist of March he has drawn out $300,000, in sterl-
</p>
<p>ing exchange and deposit receipts. On the 6th of April last there
</p>
<p>is a deposit receipt for $180,000. The banks in Canada give de-
</p>
<p>posit receipts, which are paid when presented, upon fifteen days
</p>
<p>notice. On the 8th of April he drew a bill of 446 12s. id., and
</p>
<p>on the same day 4,000, sterling. On the 24th of March he drew
</p>

<p>JACOB THOMPSON'S BANK ACCOUNT. 183
</p>
<p>he gave a check to the hotel keeper, which I cashed, and he
</p>
<p>then left the hotel. His friends stated to me that he was going to
</p>
<p>Halifax, overland. Navigation was not open then, and I was told
</p>
<p>he was going overland to Halifax, and thence to Europe. I
</p>
<p>thought it strange at the time that he was going overland, when
</p>
<p>by waiting two weeks longer he could have taken a steamer ; and
</p>
<p>it was talked of in the bank among the clerks. The account was
</p>
<p>opened with Jacob Thompson individually. The newspaper report
</p>
<p>was that he was financial agent of the Confederate States. We
</p>
<p>only knew that he brought Southern sterling exchange bills, drawn
</p>
<p>on Southern agents in the old country, and brought them to our
</p>
<p>bank for collection. How they came to him we did not know.
</p>
<p>He was not, as far as I know, engaged in any business in Canada
</p>
<p>requiring these large sums of money.
</p>
<p>" He had other large money transactions in Canada. I knew of
</p>
<p>one transaction of $50,000, that came through the Niagara District
</p>
<p>Bank, at St. Catherines, a check drawn to the order of Mr. Clement
</p>
<p>C. Clay, and deposited by him in that bank ; they sent it to us,
</p>
<p>August 1 6th, 1864, to put to their credit.
</p>
<p>" Thompson has several times bought from us United States
</p>
<p>notes or greenbacks. On August 25th he bought $15,000 in
</p>
<p>greenbacks, and on July I4th, $19,125. This was the amount
</p>
<p>he paid in gold, and at that time the exchange was about 55.
</p>
<p>I could not say what the amount of greenbacks was, but that is
</p>
<p>what he paid for it in gold. On March I4th last he bought $1,000
</p>
<p>worth of greenbacks at 44f , for which he paid $552.20 in gold.
</p>
<p>On the 2Oth of March he bought 6,500 sterling at 9^. He also
</p>
<p>bought drafts on New York in several instances. J. Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>the actor, had a small account at our bank. I had one or two
</p>
<p>transactions with him, but do not remember more at present.
</p>
<p>He may have been in the bank a dozen times ; and I distinctly
</p>
<p>remember seeing him once. He has still left to his credit $455,
</p>
<p>arising from a deposit made by him, consisting of $2OO, in $20
</p>
<p>Montreal bills, and Davis's check on Merchant's Bank of $255.

<p>Davis is a broker, who kept his office opposite the St. Lawrence
</p>
<p>Hall, and is, I think, either from Richmond or Baltimore.
</p>
<p>" When Booth came into the bank for this exchange he bought
</p>
<p>1 84 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>a bill of exchange for 61 and some odd shillings, remarking, ' I
</p>
<p>am going to run the blockade, and in case I should be captured
</p>
<p>can my capturers make use of the exchange ? ' I told him they
</p>
<p>could not unless he endorsed the bill, which was made payable to
</p>
<p>his order. He then said he would take $300, and pulled out that
</p>
<p>amount, I think, in American gold. I figured up what $300
</p>
<p>would come to at the rate of exchange. I think it was 9^, and
</p>
<p>gave him a bill of exchange for 61 and some odd shillings."

</p>
<p>for $25,000 of his expenditures: " I am assistant manager of the
</p>

</p>
<p>acquainted with Jacob Thompson, formerly of Mississippi, who has

</p>
<p>his account with our bank, a copy of which was presented to this

<p>Commission by Mr. Campbell, our assistant teller.
</p>
<p>"The moneys to Mr. Thompson's credit accrued from the

<p>negotiation of bills of exchange, drawn by the secretary of the

<p>& Company, of Liverpool. They were understood to be the finan-
</p>
<p>cial agents of the Confederate States at Liverpool, and the face
</p>
<p>of the bills, I believe, bore that inscription. Among the disposi-
</p>
<p>tions made from that fund, by Jacob Thompson, was $25,000

</p>
<p>" I have found this draft in the hands of the payee of the City
</p>
<p>Bank in New York, and I understand from the cashier it has been
</p>
<p>paid. Mr. Thompson was frequently in the habit of drawing
</p>
<p>moneys in the name of an officer of the bank, so as to conceal the
</p>
<p>person for whom it was really intended.
</p>
<p>" A good deal of Thompson's exchange was drawn in that way,
</p>
<p>so that there is no indication, except from the bank or the locality
</p>
<p>on which the bill was drawn, to show where use was made of the
</p>
<p>funds. Large amounts were drawn for, at his instance, on the
</p>
<p>banks of New York, but we were not acquainted with the use they
</p>
<p>were put to.

<p>handed to the witness, who said : " This is a copy of Jacob Thomp-

<p>for purpose of exchange on New York, and also on London. The

</p>
<p>receipts, which may be paid anywhere."
</p>
<p>In answer to a question by Mr. Aiken, counsel for defense, the
</p>
<p>witness said : " I do not remember any drafts cashed at our bank
</p>
<p>in favor of James Watson Wallace, Richard Montgomery, or James
</p>
<p>B. Merritt. I have no recollection of the names."

<p>Evidence of George Wilkes : "I am acquainted with Benjamin
</p>
<p>Wood, of New York, and am familiar with his handwriting. The
</p>
<p>signature at the back of that bill of exchange I should take to be
</p>
<p>his. At the date of this bill Benjamin Wood was a member of
</p>
<p>Congress of the United States. He was editor and proprietor of
</p>
<p>the New York News, so he told me himself. The paper, I have
</p>
<p>heard, has been recently managed by John Mitchell, late editor or
</p>
<p>assistant editor of the Richmond Examiner and the Richmond En-
</p>
<p>quirer" The endorsement was further proven to be in the hand-
</p>
<p>writing of Ben. Wood by the testimony of Abram D. Burrell.
</p>
<p>This testimony not only accounts for $25,000 paid to Ben.
</p>
<p>Wood, then a member of Congress from New York City, for
</p>
<p>services rendered to the rebel cause in the halls of legislation,
</p>
<p>or attempted to be there rendered, but more particularly in
</p>
<p>the management of the New York News. In his capacity as
</p>
<p>a legislator as well as that of editor, Ben. Wood made himself
</p>
<p>conspicuous as a traitor to his country, and thus he was re-
</p>
<p>warded by Jacob Thompson for his services to the rebel cause.
</p>
<p>The testimony also throws light on Jacob's method of doing busi-
</p>
<p>ness in a secret, underhanded manner, in order that the object and
</p>
<p>purport of his transactions being thus concealed from public knowl-
</p>
<p>edge he could engage in any wicked scheme without detection.

<p>by this skilfull secret financier in such shape that, upon the failure
</p>
<p>to fulfill the contract and then come forward and claim the reward,
</p>
<p>they reverted to the Hon. Jacob Thompson.
</p>
<p>JACOB THOMPSONS BANK ACCOUNT. 1 87
</p>
<p>The testimony of these witnesses reveals several very important
</p>
<p>facts bearing on the subject of our investigations. First, it is
</p>
<p>shown that the rebel agents in Canada were kept well supplied
</p>
<p>with money by the Richmond government, their credits in the
</p>
<p>Canada banks arising from Southern bills of exchange on the
</p>
<p>rebel agents at Liverpool. Now the question arises, for what
</p>
<p>purpose was this money placed at their disposal? They were
</p>
<p>sent by the rebel government to Canada to work for the success of
</p>
<p>the rebellion in ways and by means which have been disclosed
</p>
<p>by the testimony. Of course, then, they were supported whilst in
</p>
<p>Canada by the Richmond government, and it is reasonable to
</p>
<p>suppose at a fixed salary that had been agreed upon in advance.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, their personal expenses had to be met, and as
</p>
<p>icy were by no means parsimonious in their habits, this item
</p>
<p>done would make a considerable draft on their treasury. Then
</p>
<p>they employed a good many men, escaped rebel soldiers and
</p>
<p>>ther rebel refugees at various times to execute various schemes
</p>
<p>concocted by them to aid the rebellion.
</p>
<p>One witness stated that they said they had eight hundred men
</p>
<p>secreted in Chicago, in the summer of 1864, to aid in a plan to
</p>
<p>liberate the rebel prisoners at Camp Douglass, which plan was
</p>
<p>frustrated by the government being informed of it in advance by
</p>
<p>friends in Canada who were cognizant of the plot. Of course the
</p>
<p>expenses of all of these men had to be met, and no doubt liberal
</p>
<p>compensation made to those who were entrusted with the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of the plot. So, also, the plot to burn the city of New York,
</p>
<p>the St. Albans raid, and various other schemes of like character
</p>
<p>cost a good deal of money. Of course they defrayed all of the
</p>
<p>expenses of the trial of the St. Albans raiders for extradition.
</p>
<p>The scheme of spreading disease and death through infected
</p>
<p>clothing, in which Dr. Blackburn was employed as their agent, no
</p>
<p>doubt cost them a good round sum. It will be remembered that
</p>
<p>Blackburn employed Godfrey Joseph Hyams as his agent to get
</p>
<p>the infected clothing sold at such places in the United States as

</p>
<p>he indicated, under the promise of one hundred thousand dollars ;
</p>
<p>and although he and Thompson chiselled Hyams out of nine
</p>
<p>hundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred dollars of this, it
</p>
<p>1 88 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>is quite reasonable to suppose that Blackburn received large pay
</p>
<p>for his risk and trouble in going to Bermuda and carefully infect-
</p>
<p>ing this clothing.
</p>
<p>The witness, Montgomery, testified that he heard Clay say, in
</p>
<p>speaking of these enterprises, that " they always had plenty of
</p>
<p>money to pay for anything that was worth paying for." We
</p>
<p>have seen from the testimony that Booth, and we have good
</p>
<p>reason to infer that Surratt also, were kept plentifully supplied
</p>
<p>with money from the time that a definate arrangement was made
</p>
<p>with them to take charge of the assassination job in the latter part
</p>
<p>of October, 1 864, until the final accomplishment, so far as it was
</p>
<p>accomplished, of their plot. We have seen that they were both
</p>
<p>without occupation, or legitimate source of income, during all that
</p>
<p>time, and that they were actively engaged in preparation for their
</p>
<p>work, and were going in a style of prodigality in their expendi-
</p>
<p>tures, travelling a great deal, boarding not only themselves, but
</p>
<p>also several of the hired assistants, at hotels in Washington,
</p>
<p>without regard to cost, even stipulating in the case of Payne
</p>
<p>that his meals should be served to him in his room. Then they
</p>
<p>were every way profligate in their habits, especially in drinking
</p>
<p>and smoking both costly vices and also in purchasing horses
</p>
<p>and hiring them kept at livery stables ; and still further in hiring
</p>
<p>horses of livery men for their excursions about the suburbs of the
</p>
<p>city in perfecting their plans for escape. Again, Booth always
</p>
<p>had money to use in drawing into the plot, and in holding assist-
</p>
<p>ants. No doubt the fifty dollars sent to Arnold in a letter came
</p>
<p>from Booth ; and we know he sent in a letter fifty dollars to
</p>
<p>Chester to induce him to join him, and although he allowed
</p>
<p>Chester to return this money it was not until he had fully satisfied
</p>
<p>himself that it was useless to press Chester any further on the
</p>
<p>subject. They were evidently as profuse in their promises of
</p>
<p>reward to their co-conspirators whom they hired as Blackburn
</p>
<p>was to Hyams. Booth offered to deposit three thousand dollars
</p>
<p>for a retainer's fee to Chester ; and, in addition to this, assured him
</p>

</p>
<p>that if he would go into the conspiracy he would never want for
</p>
<p>money as long as he lived. Even so worthless a fellow as
</p>
<p>Atzerodt had been fed with the idea that he would soon have as
</p>
<p>JACOB THOMPSON'S BANK ACCOUNT. 189
</p>
<p>much gold as would keep him a gentleman the balance of his
</p>
<p>life.
</p>
<p>Now, where was all this money to come from ? Evidently from
</p>
<p>Jacob Thompson's bank account. The evidence of the bank
</p>
<p>teller shows that the bill of exchange which was found on Booth's
</p>
<p>body after his death was the same bought of him by Booth.
</p>
<p>This bill of exchange was dated Oct. 27, 1864.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the Selby letter (the Selby being,
</p>
<p>no doubt, an alias, as they were all sailing under aliases} reveals
</p>
<p>the fact that it was at that meeting of the conspirators in Mont-
</p>
<p>real, about the last of October, 1 864, that the plot was matured,
</p>
<p>and arrangements made for carrying it into effect. No doubt this
</p>
<p>arrangement made between the Canada Cabinet and Booth and
</p>
<p>his fellow assassins involved a large expenditure of money such
</p>
<p>an amount, that when the " Cabinet " came to consider the matter
</p>
<p>over they shrunk from the responsibility and called a halt until
</p>
<p>they could get the sanction of the Richmond government in such
</p>
<p>a form that they could have a voucher to show for this expendi-
</p>
<p>ture. Hence, their after regret that " the boys had not been
</p>
<p>allowed to act when they wanted to." This sanction was delivered
</p>
<p>to them by Surratt on the 6th of April, when Thompson, placing
</p>
<p>his hand on the despatches, exclaimed, " This makes the thing all
</p>
<p>right ! " It would be a very singular coincidence, indeed, on the
</p>
<p>theory that Davis, Thompson, and the others in Canada were not
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy, that on this very day Thompson drew on his
</p>
<p>bank account for $180,000 by a deposit receipt; and that on the
</p>
<p>8th, two days later, he drew for ^446 12s., id., and then again on
</p>
<p>the same day for .4,000 sterling, amounting in the aggregate to
</p>
<p>over two hundred thousand dollars. Assuming this to have been
</p>
<p>the cost of the assassinations for which Booth and Surratt had
</p>
<p>made themselves responsible, and that on which they were count-
</p>
<p>ing to keep them well supplied with money all the balance of their
</p>
<p>lives, the question arises what became of this money? Of course
</p>
<p>their hired assassins were only to be paid when they had fulfilled
</p>

</p>
<p>their contract. The money was subject to this contingency;
</p>
<p>hence there was, no doubt, a provisional arrangement by which
</p>
<p>Thompson held control over the reward promised them, and, when
</p>
<p>190 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>we look at the final result of the thing, we can readily see that the
</p>
<p>money, in the end, reverted to Thompson.
</p>
<p>There is another very remarkable coincidence revealed in this
</p>
<p>testimony ; that is, the fact of Thompson's leaving Canada on the
</p>
<p>1 4th of April, 1865, for Europe, travelling overland to Halifax,
</p>
<p>when by waiting two weeks longer he could have gone by
</p>
<p>steamer. This was such an unusual circumstance as to require
</p>
<p>explanation, and excited remarks amongst the clerks in the bank
</p>
<p>at the time. If we have been led by the evidence to the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that the government fully sustained its charge and specifica-
</p>
<p>tion against Jacob Thompson, we can at once explain this coinci-
</p>
<p>dence of his leaving Montreal for Europe by the overland route to
</p>
<p>Halifax on the very day on which he expected the plot to be
</p>
<p>consummated. He could not afford to wait for the opening of
</p>
<p>navigation, lest his flight might be impeded by arrest, and a
</p>
<p>warrant or demand for his extradition on the charge that he was
</p>
<p>a member of the conspiracy. " The wicked flee where no man
</p>
<p>pursueth." A guilty conscience is its own accuser. This remark-
</p>
<p>able coincidence, equally with the other, is presumptive evidence
</p>
<p>of his guilt.
</p>
<p>Booth kept his bank account in the same bank with Thompson,
</p>
<p>and there is every reason to believe that his credits were from
</p>
<p>money supplied to him by Thompson. When he drew the bill of
</p>
<p>October 27th, which was found on his person after his death, he
</p>
<p>explained that he was going to run the blockade. We have
</p>
<p>seen what he meant by that; and this gives additional evidence
</p>
<p>that the assassination plot was fully matured, as shown by the
</p>
<p>Selby letter, at that time, and that on the part of Booth, acting
</p>
<p>under the latitude of discretion contained in that letter, he was
</p>
<p>only biding his time, waiting and watching for, and seeking to
</p>
<p>make, an opportunity; and that had he not been restrained by
</p>
<p>Thompson until he could get authority from Richmond that would
</p>
<p>serve him as a voucher for the large outlay of money involved,
</p>
<p>he would have acted long before he finally did.

</p>
<p>Now the question comes up, what became of the money de-
</p>
<p>posited to Thompson's credit by the Confederate government in
</p>
<p>the banks of Canada? We have seen that he had deposited
</p>
<p>JACOB THOMPSONS BANK ACCOUNT. 191
</p>
<p>to his credit in the Ontario Bank of Montreal $649,873.28, and
</p>

<p>real bank of over $200,000 by the drafts of the 6th and 8th of
</p>
<p>April, we have every reason to believe was dependent upon con-
</p>
<p>tingencies for their payment which were never fulfilled, and so
</p>
<p>this large amount reverted to Thompson. The Confederate
</p>
<p>government died suddenly and unexpectedly about this time,
</p>
<p>leaving no executor with will annexed, and no one to look after
</p>
<p>its assets, or court authorized to appoint an administrator ; and so
</p>
<p>it would seem that in this case Jacob Thompson was not only a
</p>
<p>man that had achieved notoriety, but that he also had riches thrust
</p>
<p>upon him. Perhaps he and Clay, Tucker, Sanders, Cleary, and
</p>
<p>Holcombe held a court in equity, and distributed amongst them

</p>
<p>THE CASE OF MRS. SURRATT.
</p>
<p>So earnest and persistent have been the efforts of rebel priests,
</p>
<p>politicians and editors to pervert public opinion in regard to the
</p>
<p>case of Mrs. Surratt that it becomes necessary to devote some
</p>
<p>special consideration to it even at the expense of some repetition.
</p>
<p>Immediately after her execution a wild howl was set up by these
</p>
<p>people for the purpose of making political capital out of the
</p>
<p>sympathy and tender feeling which we all have for her sex. Her
</p>
<p>innocence was boldly asserted, and the government was denounced
</p>
<p>for her execution. They suppressed or set at naught all the evi-
</p>
<p>dence against her, and made many false statements to subserve
</p>
<p>the purpose they had in view. These efforts were only made by
</p>
<p>those who had been the enemies of the government during the
</p>
<p>war who had either asserted the right of secession, or denied
</p>
<p>the right of the government to coerce (to use their own expression)
</p>
<p>a State into submission to its authority.
</p>
<p>Because President Lincoln felt that the 'obligations of his official
</p>
<p>oath required him to maintain the authority of the government
</p>
<p>and to preserve the Union they had all through the terrible
</p>
<p>struggle in which he was engaged been his bitter enemies. They
</p>
<p>were actuated by a spirit of malignant hatred of the Union cause,
</p>
<p>and stood ready to oppose and denounce every measure that the
</p>
<p>President had found necessary to the success of his purpose and
</p>
<p>work. Their hostility to the government was only rendered more
</p>
<p>intense by its success in putting down the rebellion, and so they
</p>
<p>were ready to seize on this occasion, that they might, out of it,
</p>
<p>make political capital. This effort has never been abandoned, and
</p>
<p>the case of Mrs. Surratt continues to be worked for all that it is

<p>THE CASE OF MRS. SURRATT. 193
</p>
<p>worth by that portion of the Northern press that inherits the old
</p>
<p>copperhead animus.
</p>
<p>To fully understand the case of Mrs. Surratt we must make her
</p>
<p>acquaintance as early as 1863. We find her at that time living
</p>
<p>at Surrattsville, in Prince George County, Md., ten miles below
</p>
<p>Washington City. The villa called Surrattsville consisted simply
</p>
<p>of a country tavern owned and occupied by Mrs. Surratt. She
</p>
<p>was a widow with three children, two sons and a daughter. The
</p>
<p>elder son had gone to Texas and had volunteered in the rebel
</p>
<p>service. The younger son, John H. Surratt, a young man of nine-
</p>
<p>teen, had left St. Charles College in the summer of 1861, not to
</p>
<p>volunteer as a soldier, but to engage in the secret service of the
</p>
<p>Confederacy. There was a United States post-office at Surratts-
</p>
<p>ville ; and this young man, in addition to his duties as a Confederate
</p>
<p>spy and carrier of despatches for the rebel government, handled
</p>
<p>Uncle Sam's mail and delivered it to his neighbors. From all this
</p>
<p>we can readily gather the attitude of Mrs. Surratt toward the
</p>
<p>government. On the trial of John H. Surratt, John F. Tibbetts
</p>
<p>testified that in 1863 he was carrying the mail from Washington
</p>
<p>to Charlotte Hall, and that he stopped at Surrattsville to deliver
</p>
<p>the mail at that office. On one occasion, whilst waiting for the
</p>
<p>mail there, he heard Mrs. Surratt say that she would give one
</p>
<p>thousand dollars to any one that would kill Lincoln. He also
</p>
<p>testified that when there was a Union victory he heard her son
</p>
<p>say in her presence that, " The d d Northern army and the
</p>
<p>leader thereof ought to be sent to hell."
</p>
<p>Here we see the deep and traitorous hostility to the govern-
</p>
<p>ment of these people who were in its service under the obligations
</p>
<p>of an official oath. In the fall of 1864 Mrs. Surratt removed to
</p>
<p>Washington, taking the house 541 on H Street. She rented her
</p>
<p>Surrattsville property to a man by the name of Lloyd. What
</p>
<p>prompted this change is not known to the writer. Her son had
</p>
<p>so won the confidence of Jefferson Davis and Judah P. Benjamin
</p>
<p>that he had for a considerable time been entrusted by them, not

<p>only with important despatches, but also with large sums of money
</p>
<p>sent to their agents in Canada. 1 Indeed, this seems to have been

</p>
<p>the only employment in which he was then engaged ; and at this
</p>
<p>time the assassination plot, as we have seen, was engaging the
</p>
<p>serious attention both of Davis and his agents in Canada, and
</p>
<p>that both Surratt and Booth were in the confidence of these men,
</p>
<p>though they were as yet not personally acquainted with each other.
</p>
<p>Booth arranged with Dr. S. A. Mudd to come to Washington
</p>
<p>to introduce him to Surratt, which he did on the 23d day of
</p>
<p>December, 1864. Their acquaintanceship ripened into the closest
</p>
<p>intimacy with a rapidity that was due to a common sympathy and
</p>
<p>a common purpose. They were from that time much together,
</p>
<p>and Booth at once became a frequent and constant visitor at the
</p>
<p>house of Mrs. Surratt. 1 From this time on the evidence begins
</p>
<p>to accumulate, showing her to be informed of the work in which
</p>
<p>they were engaged, and to have fully entered into their scheme
</p>
<p>as a helper. 2 There were a number of boarders in her house.
</p>
<p>These merely received the ordinary civilities of personal inter-
</p>
<p>course from Booth ; but with John and his mother his intercourse
</p>
<p>was always of a private and confidential character.
</p>
<p>Booth's habit was to come into that house, and after the com-
</p>
<p>mon-place civilities to tap John on the shoulder and ask him to
</p>
<p>spare him a moment of his time, when they they would retire to an
</p>
<p>upstairs room and remain in conference sometimes for two or three
</p>
<p>hours. In John's absence (and he was frequently away) Booth would
</p>
<p>ask Mrs. Surratt to grant him a private interview, which she always
</p>
<p>did. What business could this man, who had been so recently
</p>
<p>introduced to the family, have had that required so much and
</p>
<p>such strict privacy? Whatever it was, Mrs. Surratt was trusted by
</p>
<p>him equally with her son. We have now presented the state of
</p>
<p>things in that house between these parties as shown by undisputed
</p>
<p>testimony, and will proceed to show from the further evidence in
</p>
<p>the case what the business was that they had on hand.
</p>
<p>Shortly after John H. Surratt made the acquaintance of Booth,
</p>
<p>Atzerodt became a frequent visitor at Mrs. Surratt's. 3 The first

<p>THE CASE OF MRS. SURRATT. 195
</p>
<p>time he came he inquired for " John H. Surratt or Mrs. Surratt."
</p>
<p>How did he know of Mrs. Surratt in such a way that he could
</p>
<p>make her the alternative of John? In the early part of March
</p>
<p>Payne called at the Surratt house, and inquired for John H. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt, but when told that he was not at home he asked to see Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt. 1 He was an entire stranger, but knew enough, not only
</p>
<p>about John but also about his mother, to make her the alternative
</p>
<p>in the absence of her son. He passed under the alias of Wood on
</p>
<p>this visit. Mrs. Surratt took him in for the night, and got her
</p>
<p>boarder, Wiechmann, to take him to his room, where she had his
</p>
<p>supper served to him. Would she thus have acted toward a
</p>
<p>stranger of whom she knew nothing? It is not to be believed.
</p>
<p>Payne carried the key to her hospitality in some secret sign that
</p>
<p>had been adopted by these conspirators. Toward the last of
</p>
<p>March Payne called again, giving the name of Payne and claim-
</p>
<p>ing to be a Baptist preacher. He remained in the house this time
</p>
<p>for three days, and on one of these days was surprised by Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann coming into his room, where he found John H. Surratt and
</p>
<p>Payne fencing with bowie-knives, and with revolvers lying on the
</p>
<p>bed ; there were also four sets of new spurs. Wiechmann spoke
</p>
<p>about what he had seen to Mrs. Surratt, saying " that he did not
</p>
<p>like the look of things," when she said, " Oh, you need not be
</p>
<p>disturbed about it; John rides a good deal in the country, and
</p>
<p>has to carry these things to protect himself." !
</p>
<p>It was during this visit that Booth, Surratt, Payne, Atzerodt,
</p>
<p>Herold, and one or two others, started out on an expedition from
</p>
<p>which they returned under circumstances of disappointment and
</p>
<p>rage, as heretofore recounted, and of the import of which Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt was seen to have been fully informed, as she was weeping,
</p>
<p>and declined going to her dinner. Upon the failure of this expedi-
</p>
<p>tion Booth went to New York and Payne to Baltimore. The plot,
</p>
<p>however, was not abandoned ; and for its future prosecution it seemed
</p>
<p>desirable to Booth and Surratt to transfer Payne to Washington,

<p>away until he was wanted. They procured a room for him at the

</p>
<p>Herndon House, representing him to be a delicate gentleman,
</p>
<p>and stipulating that his meals should be served to him in his
</p>
<p>room. 1 It came to the knowledge of Wiechmann that Booth and
</p>
<p>Surratt had placed some one in that house, and he was naturally
</p>
<p>curious to know whom it was. Atzerodt let the secret out, and
</p>
<p>when Wiechmann spoke of its being Payne who was quartered in
</p>
<p>the Herndon House, Mrs. Surratt asked him how he knew. When
</p>
<p>he gave Atzerodt as the source of his information she manifested
</p>
<p>some displeasure. But we are not left to infer from this that she
</p>
<p>had been informed of the disposition that had been made of Payne,
</p>
<p>for a night or two after that, when returning from an evening ser-
</p>
<p>vice at St. Patrick's Church, in company with Wiechmann and
</p>
<p>three or four young ladies, she stopped when they came to the
</p>
<p>Herndon House, and asked the party to wait on her a few minutes
</p>
<p>whilst she should go in and see Payne. 2 They waited on this
</p>
<p>interview for about twenty minutes. Thus we see that she was
</p>
<p>notified of every move that was made in preparation for the
</p>
<p>assassination.
</p>
<p>Not only were Booth, Atzerodt, and Payne visitors at Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt's, but also the notorious rebel spy and blockade runner, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Slater, alias Brown, was one of her visitors. This woman stayed
</p>
<p>all night with her toward the latter part of March, 1865, and was
</p>
<p>accompanied by Mrs. Surratt and her son John when she left on
</p>
<p>the next morning, Mrs. Surratt going as far as Surrattsville, whilst
</p>
<p>her son accompanied her to Richmond in place of a Mr. Howell
</p>
<p>whom she had expected to have for her escort, but who had been
</p>
<p>arrested, and so Surratt took his place. 3
</p>
<p>On one occasion Mrs. Surratt sent Mr. Wiechmann to Booth
</p>
<p>with a message that she wanted to see him on private business, to
</p>
<p>which Booth responded.
</p>
<p>On the Tuesday before the assassination Mrs. Surratt asked
</p>
<p>Wiechmann to drive her down to Surrattsville, and upon his con-
</p>
<p>senting to do so she sent him to Booth to request the use of his

</p>
<p>had sold his horse and buggy, but he gave him ten dollars with
</p>
<p>which to procure one. 1 As they were on their way down they
</p>
<p>met Mrs. Surratt's tenant, Lloyd, on the road, when Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>requested Wiechmann to stop. Lloyd, recognizing her, got out of
</p>
<p>his buggy and came to the side of Mrs. Surratt's buggy, on which
</p>
<p>she was sitting, when she leaned her head out toward him and
</p>
<p>conversed with him in so low a tone that Wiechmann did not hear
</p>
<p>what was said; 2 but Lloyd testified that she told him to "have
</p>
<p>those shooting-irons handy, as they would be called for before
</p>
<p>long." The shooting-irons to which she referred were the two
</p>
<p>Spencer carbines that had been carried to Surrattsville some time
</p>
<p>previous by J. H. Surratt, Atzerodt, and Herold, and which John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt and Lloyd had hidden away, as related heretofore.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that Mrs. Surratt was kept posted in regard to every
</p>
<p>move that was made ; that she knew that these arms had been
</p>
<p>deposited there, the purpose for which they had been left there,
</p>
<p>and that they would be called for soon. We can now understand
</p>
<p>Booth's generosity in furnishing her ten dollars to pay for a
</p>
<p>conveyance she carried his message to Lloyd. On the day of
</p>
<p>the assassination she again got Wiechmann to drive her down
</p>
<p>to Surrattsville, no doubt at Booth's request, and perhaps at
</p>
<p>his expense. She gave to Wiechmann ten dollars with which
</p>
<p>to procure a conveyance, and as he passed out of her house on
</p>
<p>this errand he met Booth at the front door, in the act, as it were, of
</p>
<p>ringing the door bell. 3 When Wiechmann returned, in passing to
</p>
<p>his room, he saw Booth in the parlor conversing with Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>Booth sent by her to Lloyd, on this occasion, a field-glass and
</p>
<p>a message to have the two carbines ready, together with this glass
</p>
<p>and two bottles of whiskey, as they would be called for that night.
</p>
<p>Lloyd was absent from home when they arrived at Surrattsville,
</p>
<p>and did not return until late in the evening. Mrs. Surratt dilly-
</p>
<p>dallied until he returned, and then snatched an opportunity for a

</p>
<p>driven. She then delivered to him the field-glass and Booth's
</p>
<p>message to have the shooting-irons, etc., ready as they would be
</p>
<p>called for that night, as they were, by Booth and Herold, about
</p>
<p>midnight. Lloyd swore that this was the message which she
</p>
<p>delivered to him during that interview in the back yard. 1
</p>
<p>Can any one doubt now that Mrs. Surratt was fully posted in
</p>
<p>every particular of the assassination plot, that she was fully trusted
</p>
<p>by Booth and her son, and was in sympathy with their purpose
</p>
<p>and willing to do all she could in aiding its accomplishment,
</p>
<p>that she was, in fact, a co-conspirator?
</p>
<p>On the night of the assassination, about three o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning, a party of detectives called at Mrs. Surratt's house for
</p>
<p>the purpose of searching it to see whom they could find there,
</p>
<p>and demanded admittance. When informed of their visit and the
</p>
<p>purpose of it by Wiechmann, she said, " For God's sake let them
</p>
<p>in. I have been expecting the house to be searched." : How
</p>
<p>many people in Washington were expecting detectives to come
</p>
<p>that night to search their houses? Not one who was innocent of
</p>
<p>crime. Two nights later the inmates of this house Mrs. Surratt,
</p>
<p>her daughter, and Miss Fitzpatrick were put under arrest by the
</p>
<p>military police ; and whilst they were waiting for a conveyance at
</p>
<p>near the hour of midnight the assassin Payne rang the door bell,
</p>
<p>and was taken in and placed under arrest by the officer in charge.
</p>
<p>When Mrs. Surratt was confronted by Payne she held up her hand
</p>
<p>and solemnly said, " Before God I do not know him, and never
</p>
<p>saw him." ! It will be remembered that he had within the last
</p>
<p>three weeks to that time stayed in her house for three days and
</p>
<p>nights, and he was a man of such marked personality that he could
</p>
<p>not have been so easily forgotten. The defense, in her case,
</p>
<p>attempted to account for this by an alleged infirmity of sight, but
</p>
<p>they were unable to establish by testimony any infirmity of sight
</p>
<p>beyond what is common to her age of about forty-five. 4 It will
</p>
<p>be remembered that Payne had been hiding and skulking for three

<p>days and nights, and of all the houses in Washington her's was the
</p>
<p>only one to which he felt that he could go and entrust the secret
</p>
<p>of his presence.
</p>
<p>He could, under the circumstances in which he was placed,
</p>
<p>only have given this confidence to a co-conspirator. Having now
</p>
<p>given a brief synopsis of the testimony on which Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>was found guilty by the Commission, it will be in order for my
</p>
<p>readers to form their own conclusions as to her guilt or innocence.
</p>
<p>The writer only desires to say that additional testimony going to
</p>
<p>show the justice of the finding of the Commission in her case
</p>
<p>came out incidentally on the trial of John H. Surratt, and will
</p>
<p>also be found in the affidavit of L. J. Wiechmann, made after the
</p>
<p>military trial, in which he recounts a number of circumstances that
</p>
<p>had escaped his memory when on the witness stand, and which
</p>
<p>recurred to him in his subsequent reflections on the case. The
</p>
<p>testimony of Sergeants Dye and Cooper, given on the trial of Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt, was that in passing Mrs. Surratt's house about ten minutes
</p>
<p>after the murder, a lady which Dye (having seen Mrs. Surratt at
</p>
<p>the military trial) believed to have been her, raised a window, and
</p>
<p>thrusting her head out, asked them what was wrong down town. 1
</p>
<p>Here we have her sitting in her parlor at about twenty-five min-
</p>
<p>utes after ten o'clock waiting anxiously to hear some news. There
</p>
<p>was as yet no excitement on the street to awaken curiosity. These
</p>
<p>two soldiers believed they were the first persons to pass that house
</p>
<p>after the assassination ; the street was entirely quiet ; as they passed
</p>
<p>along they met two policemen shortly after passing the house 541,
</p>

<p>2OO ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>On the trial of Surratt a good deal of the testimony introduced
</p>
<p>to show the existence of a conspiracy to assassinate the President,
</p>
<p>and that the prisoner was a member of this conspiracy, implicated
</p>
<p>his mother in it equally with himself. Most of the witnesses that
</p>
<p>had been brought before the Commission to prove the existence
</p>
<p>of such a conspiracy, and that Mary E. Surratt was an active
</p>
<p>member of it, were again produced on this trial. As the witnesses
</p>
<p>Lloyd and Wiechmann were the most important of these, their
</p>
<p>testimony being completely conclusive of the guilt both of the
</p>
<p>the prisoner and his mother, great efforts were made to discredit,
</p>
<p>especially, the testimony of Wiechmann ; but this could not be
</p>
<p>done by any of the methods known to the law. He stood the test
</p>
<p>of every effort and came out unscathed from a bitter and most
</p>
<p>hostile cross-examination that occupied a day and a half. Every
</p>
<p>effort was made to make him contradict himself as to his present
</p>
<p>testimony in chief, as also to his testimony given two years before
</p>
<p>at the military trial, but without avail. No false witness could
</p>
<p>possibly have come out of such a fiery ordeal unscathed. Truth
</p>
<p>is always consistent with itself, and one truth is always consistent
</p>
<p>with every other correlated truth, and for this reason a witness
</p>
<p>that keeps the truth can never be entrapped.
</p>
<p>He was contradicted, it is true, by negative testimony as to
</p>
<p>some points in his evidence. Persons who were in the same room
</p>
<p>with him at the time that certain declarations were made to which
</p>
<p>he testified swore that they did not hear them. But such testi-
</p>
<p>mony is of no value. If one person in company with many others
</p>
<p>in a room were to swear that he heard the clock strike, his testi-
</p>
<p>mony as to that fact could not be discredited by that of all the
</p>
<p>others swearing that they did not hear it strike. Positive testi-
</p>
<p>mony cannot be overthrown, or even shaken, by negative. Wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were also brought to prove that he had made different
</p>
<p>statements, and some to prove that he had virtually admitted that
</p>
<p>he had testified falsely as to Mrs. Surratt, and that he had been

</p>
<p>held under duress by certain officers of the government and
</p>
<p>required to state in his testimony what they dictated to him.
</p>
<p>These efforts also proved failures, as a close, scrutinizing cross-
</p>
<p>examination made it apparent that these witnessess had been sub-

<p>THE CASE OF MRS. SURRATT. 2OI
</p>
<p>orned, and were delivering a cooked-up testimony. After every
</p>
<p>effort had been made that could be devised by the ingenuity of
</p>
<p>counsels, Wiechmann stood before the court, the jury, and the
</p>
<p>country, as an honest, conscientious, truthful man. He was also
</p>
<p>a man of superior talent, education, and intelligence. In short, he
</p>
<p>established a character that must challenge the admiration of every
</p>
<p>candid mind.
</p>
<p>The attempt was also made to overthrow Lloyd's testimony,
</p>
<p>but without success. His testimony was assailed principally on
</p>
<p>the ground that he was drunk when he returned to his home on
</p>
<p>that evening, the I4th of April, when Mrs. Surratt snatched an
</p>
<p>opportunity to get a private interview with him, by going out to
</p>
<p>him in his back yard, as soon as he drove up, and there delivering
</p>
<p>to him the message to which he testified, and also gave him Booth's
</p>
<p>field-glass. Lloyd himself admitted that he was pretty drunk on
</p>
<p>that occasion, but he was not so drunk but that he could carry
</p>
<p>out Mrs. Surratt's instructions to the very letter. He got the car-
</p>
<p>bines and all the other things and placed them where they would
</p>
<p>be handy when called for, so that they could be delivered without
</p>
<p>detaining the parties long when they should be called for. 1 He
</p>
<p>was also on hand at the time they called, and ready to get these
</p>
<p>things for them. It is evident Lloyd knew the purpose of all this.
</p>
<p>When called on by the soldiers and detectives who were in pursuit
</p>
<p>of Booth and Herold the next morning, he denied that there had
</p>
<p>been anybody there during that night. He knew nothing. But
</p>
<p>when he found a chain of ascertained facts about to fasten upon
</p>
<p>him, in great fear and trepidation he made a clean breast of it, and
</p>
<p>told all. He then gave as a reason for his course in denying all
</p>
<p>knowledge of the matter, that he knew he could not tell all that
</p>
<p>he knew without implicating Mrs. Surratt, and that he did not
</p>
<p>want to do that.

<p>202 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Note and Affidavit of L. J. Wiechmann.
</p>
<p>Col. H. L. BURNETT, Judge Advocate, Cincinnati, Ohio:
</p>
<p>COLONEL : I stated before the Commission at Washington that I commenced to
</p>
<p>board with Mrs. Surratt in November, 1864. As a general thing I remained at home
</p>
<p>during the evenings, and consequently I heard many things which were then intended
</p>
<p>to blind me, but which now are as clear as daylight. The following facts, which have
</p>
<p>come to my recollection since the renditon of my testimony, may be of interest :
</p>
<p>AFFIDAVIT OF Louis J. WIECHMANN.
</p>
<p>I once asked Mrs. Surratt what her son John had to do with Dr. Mudd's farm;
</p>
<p>why he made himself an agent for Booth? (She herself had told me that Booth desired
</p>
<p>to purchase Mudd's farm.) Her reply was, that Dr. Mudd and the people of Charles
</p>
<p>County had got tired of Booth, and that they had pushed him on John. Before the 4th
</p>
<p>of March she was in the habit of remarking that something was going to happen to
</p>
<p>' ' Old Abe ' ' which would prevent him from taking his seat ; that General Lee
</p>
<p>was going to execute a movement which would startle the whole world. What that
</p>
<p>movement was she never said. A few days after I asked her why John brought such
</p>
<p>men as Herold and Atzerodt to the house, and why he associated with them? " Oh,
</p>
<p>John wishes to make use of them for his dirty work," was her reply. On my desiring
</p>
<p>to know what the dirty work was, she answered that " John wanted them to clean his
</p>
<p>horses." He had two at that time. And once, when she sent me to Brooks, the
</p>
<p>stable keeper, to inquire about her son, she laughed, and remarked that " Brooks con-
</p>
<p>sidered John H. Surratt and Booth and Herold and Atzerodt a party of young
</p>
<p>gamblers and sports, and that she wanted him to think so." Brooks has told me since
</p>
<p>the trial that such was actually the case, and that at one time he saw John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>with three one-hundred-dollar notes in his possession.
</p>
<p>When Richmond fell and Lee's army surrendered, when Washington was illumi-
</p>
<p>nated, Mrs. Surratt closed her house and wept. Her house was gloomy and cheerless.
</p>
<p>To use her own expression, it was "indicative of her feelings." On Good Friday I
</p>
<p>drove her into the country, ignorant of her purpose and intentions. We started at
</p>
<p>about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon. Before leaving, she had an interview
</p>
<p>with John Wilkes Booth in the parlor. On the way down she was very lively and
</p>
<p>cheerful, taking the reins into her own hands several times and urging on the steed.
</p>
<p>We halted once, and that was about three miles from Washington, when, observing that

</p>
<p>there were pickets along the road, she hailed an old farmer and wanted to know if
</p>
<p>they would remain there all the night. On being told that they were withdrawn about
</p>
<p>eight o'clock in the evening, she said "she was glad to know it." On the return I
</p>
<p>chanced to make some remark about Booth, stating that he appeared to be without
</p>
<p>employment, and asking her when he was going to act again. "Booth is done
</p>
<p>acting," she said, "and is going to New York very soon, never to return." Then
</p>
<p>turning round, she remarked: "Yes, and Booth is crazy on one subject, and I am
</p>
<p>going to give him a good scolding the next time I see him." What that "one sub-
</p>
<p>ject " was Mrs. Surratt never mentioned to me. She was very anxious to be at home at
</p>
<p>nine o'clock, saying that she had made an appointment with some gentleman who was
</p>
<p>to meet her at that hour. I asked her if it was Booth. She answered neither yes nor
</p>
<p>THE CASE OF MRS. SURRATT. 2O3
</p>
<p>no. When about a mile from the city, and having from the top of a hill caught a view
</p>
<p>of Washington swimming in a flood of light, raising her hands, she said: " I am afraid
</p>
<p>all this rejoicing will be turned into mourning, and all this glory into sadness." I
</p>
<p>asked her what she meant. She replied that after sunshine there was always a storm,
</p>
<p>and that the people were too proud and licentious, and that God would punish them.
</p>
<p>The gentleman whom she expected at nine o'clock, on her return, called. It was, as I
</p>
<p>afterwards ascertained, Booth's last visit to Mrs. Surratt, and the third one that day.
</p>
<p>She was alone with him for a few minutes in the parlor. I was in the dining-room at
</p>
<p>the time, and as soon as I had taken tea I repaired thither. Mrs. Surratt's former
</p>
<p>cheerfulness had left her. She was now very nervous, agitated, and restless. On my
</p>
<p>asking her what was the matter, she replied that she was very nervous and did not feel
</p>
<p>well. Then looking at me, she wanted to know which way the torch-light procession
</p>
<p>was going that we had seen on the avenue. I remarked that it was a procession of the
</p>
<p>arsenal employees, who were going to serenade the President. She said that she
</p>
<p>would like to know, as she was very much interested in it. Her nervousness finally
</p>
<p>increased so much that she chased myself and the young ladies, who were making a great
</p>
<p>deal of noise and laughter, to our respective rooms. When the detectives came, at three
</p>
<p>o'clock the next morning, I rapped at her door for permission to let them in. " For
</p>
<p>God's sake, let them come in ! I expected the house to be searched," she said.
</p>
<p>When the detectives had gone, and her daughter, almost frantic, cried out: "Oh,
</p>
<p>ma! Just think of that man (John Wilkes Booth) having been here an hour before
</p>
<p>the assassination ! I am afraid it will bring suspicion on us."
</p>
<p>" Anna, come what will," she replied, " I am resigned. I think that John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth was only an instrument in the hands of the Almighty to punish this proud and
</p>
<p>licentious people."

<p>CHAPTER XVI.
</p>
<p>FATHER WALTER.
</p>
<p>FROM the time of the trial of the conspirators by a military
</p>
<p>commission, and of the execution of Mrs. Surratt by the order of
</p>
<p>President Johnson, Father Walter, a secular priest of Washington
</p>
<p>City, has made himself conspicious by his efforts to pervert public
</p>
<p>opinion on the result of the trial of the conspirators by the Com-
</p>
<p>mission. Whilst rebel lawyers, editors, and politicians have boldly
</p>
<p>assailed the lawfulness of the Commission, and have denounced it
</p>
<p>as an unconstitutional tribunal, and have characterized the trial as
</p>
<p>a " Star Chamber " trial, as a contrivance for taking human life
</p>
<p>under a mockery of a judicial procedure, but with no purpose of
</p>
<p>securing the ends of justice, Father Walter and other priests whose
</p>
<p>sympathies were with the Southern Confederacy have earnestly
</p>
<p>seconded their efforts by the invention and circulation of cunningly
</p>
<p>devised falsehoods. Father Walter has every now and then bobbed
</p>
<p>up with the assertion of Mrs. Surratt's entire innocence. Knowing
</p>
<p>that not one in a thousand of our people has ever read the testi-
</p>
<p>mony on which she was convicted, he feels that he can boldly
</p>
<p>assert that " there was not evidence enough against her to hang a
</p>
<p>cat." He has also become bold enough to state as facts what the
</p>
<p>evidence shows to be falsehoods. As an example of this : in an
</p>
<p>article in the "Catholic Review" he asserts in regard to Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt's trip to Surrattsville on the afternoon of the day of the
</p>
<p>assassination that she had ordered her carriage for the trip, which
</p>
<p>was purely on private business, on the forenoon of that day, and
</p>
<p>before it was known that the President would go to the theatre.
</p>
<p>Why, if this was true, was it not proven in her defense? There
</p>
<p>was no such testimony produced. The testimony on this point
</p>
<p>against her was that shortly after two o'clock on that afternoon

</p>
<p>she went up stairs to Wiechmann's room, tapped at the door, and
</p>
<p>when it was opened she said to Mr. Wiechmann, " I have just
</p>
<p>received a letter from Mr. Calvert that makes it necessary for me
</p>
<p>to go to Surrattsville to-day and see Mr. Nothey. Would you be
</p>
<p>so good as to get a conveyance and drive me down ? " Upon
</p>
<p>Wiechmann's consenting to do so, she handed him a ten dollar
</p>
<p>bill with which to procure a conveyance. Surely there is no evi-
</p>
<p>dence here that a carriage had been ordered already, as Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann was left free to procure a conveyance where he might see fit.
</p>
<p>Wiechmann went down stairs, and as he opened the front door
</p>
<p>he saw John Wilkes Booth, who was in the act, as it were, of pull-
</p>
<p>ing the front door bell. Booth entered the house.
</p>
<p>When young Wiechmann returned, after having procured the
</p>
<p>buggy, he went up to his own room after some necessary articles
</p>
<p>of clothing, and as he again descended the stairs and passed by
</p>
<p>the parlor door he observed that Booth was in the parlor convers-
</p>
<p>ing with Mrs. Surratt. In a little while Booth came down to the
</p>
<p>front door steps, and waved his hand in token of adieu to Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann, who was standing at the curb.
</p>
<p>When Mrs. Surratt came and was in the act of getting into the
</p>
<p>buggy, she remembered that she had forgotten something, and
</p>
<p>said, " Wait a moment, until I go and get those things of Mr.
</p>
<p>Booth's." She returned from the parlor with a package which
</p>
<p>was done up in brown paper, the contents of which the witness
</p>
<p>did not see, but which was afterwards shown to have been the
</p>
<p>field-glass which Booth carried with him in his flight. This glass
</p>
<p>Booth sent to Lloyd by Mrs. Surratt, with a message to have it,
</p>
<p>with the two carbines and two bottles of whiskey, where they
</p>
<p>would be handy, as they would be called for that night. Lloyd
</p>
<p>swore that this was the message delivered to him by Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>in the private interview she sought with him in his back yard on
</p>
<p>his return home that evening, and that in accordance with these
</p>
<p>instructions he delivered them to Booth and Herold about mid-

<p>night that night. 1 Now let us see about the private business on
</p>
<p>which she professed to be going, and on which she claimed on her

</p>
<p>.ators and on the trial of J. H. Surratt. Also testimony of Trial Conspirators, p. 126.

<p>2O6 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>trial that she went. The letter from Mr. Calvert was a demand
</p>
<p>for money that she owed him, and was written at Bladensburg on
</p>
<p>the 1 2th of April. On the afternoon of the I4th she presented
</p>
<p>herself to Wiechmann and claimed that she had just received it.
</p>
<p>It would seem very strange that it took this letter two days to
</p>
<p>reach her at a distance of only six miles. She claimed that she
</p>
<p>must go and see Mr. Nothey, who owed her, and get money
</p>
<p>from him to pay her debt to Mr. Calvert. Mr. Nothey lived five
</p>
<p>miles below Surrattsville, and as she claimed that she had just
</p>
<p>received Mr. Calvert's letter it was impossible that she could have
</p>
<p>made any arrangement with Nothey to meet her at Surrattsville
</p>
<p>that day. She did not meet him there, neither did she go to his
</p>
<p>house to see him. When she arrived at Surrattsville she took
</p>
<p>Wiechmann into the parlor at the hotel and asked him to write
</p>
<p>a letter for her to Mr. Nothey, which he did at her dictation ; and
</p>
<p>this she sent to Mr. Nothey by a Mr. Bennett Gwinn, a neigh-
</p>
<p>bor of his, who happened to be passing down.
</p>
<p>Now, in view of all these facts, can any one see how her private
</p>
<p>business was in any way subserved by her trip to Surrattsville on
</p>
<p>that afternoon? She could as easily have written to Mr. Nothey
</p>
<p>from Washington as from Surrattsville. A postage stamp, a sheet
</p>
<p>of paper and an envelope would have saved her six dollars, the cost
</p>
<p>of her trip, and would have served her business just as well. The
</p>
<p>truth is that this talk of going on private business of her own was
</p>
<p>all a fabrication, first to deceive Mr. Wiechmann as to the object
</p>
<p>of her trip, and then to be used, should it become necessary, in
</p>
<p>her defense. We have already seen what her real business was.
</p>
<p>Father Walter falsifies again in the article referred to in say-
</p>
<p>ing that she did not see Lloyd on that afternoon, but delivered the
</p>
<p>things to his sister-in-law, Mrs. Offutt. 1 Both Lloyd and his
</p>
<p>sister-in-law testified to her interview with him in his back yard,
</p>
<p>and Lloyd testified as to what passed between them on that
</p>
<p>occassion.

<p>been so far forgotten that he can foist upon the public any state-
</p>
<p>ment that he may please to fabricate. We would kindly remind
</p>
<p>the reverend Father that no ultimate gain can be derived from an
</p>
<p>effort to suppress the truth. Neither can it be obliterated by our
</p>
<p>prejudices. We may misconstrue facts, but we cannot wipe them
</p>
<p>out by a mere stroke of the pen ; and a fact once made can never
</p>
<p>be recalled. But I am not yet done with this Father. He pre-
</p>
<p>faces his article in the " Review " with the statement that he
</p>
<p>heard Mrs. Surratt's last confession, and that whilst his priestly
</p>
<p>vows do not permit him to reveal the secrets of the confessional,
</p>
<p>yet from knowledge in his possession he is prepared to assert her
</p>
<p>entire innocence of this most atrocious crime. He means that we
</p>
<p>shall understand that were he at liberty to give her last confession
</p>
<p>to the world he could say that she then and there asserted her
</p>
<p>entire innocence.
</p>
<p>Will Father Walter deny that under the teachings of the Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic Church he had an absolute right, with her consent, to
</p>
<p>make her confession public on this point? Nay more, could not
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt have compelled him to do so in vindication of her
</p>
<p>own good name, and of the honor of the church of which she was
</p>
<p>a member? And having this consent, was it not his most solemn
</p>
<p>duty to proclaim her confessed innocence in every public way,
</p>
<p>through the press, and even from the very steps of the gallows ?
</p>
<p>Why was not that confession made public? Why was it not
</p>
<p>reduced to writing and signed with her own hand ? Why has it
</p>
<p>not in its entirety been given to the world? Why must the public
</p>
<p>wait twenty-seven years, and instead of having the full confession be
</p>
<p>required to content itself, in so great a case, with a mere assertion
</p>
<p>from the reverend Father, based on his alleged knowledge? Aye,
</p>
<p>just there's the rub ! \
</p>
<p>That confession of Mrs. Surratt's would have proved very inter-
</p>
<p>esting reading, and might have let in a flood of light on some
</p>
<p>places that are now very dark ; it would, indeed, have shown how

<p>far Mrs. Surratt was involved in the abduction and assassination
</p>
<p>plots, and to what degree she was the willing or unwilling tool of
</p>
<p>her son, and of John Wilkes Booth. That confession would have
</p>
<p>shown the object of Booth's visit to her on the very day and eve of
</p>
<p>208 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>the murder. It would have explained what she had in her mind
</p>
<p>when she carried Booth's field-glass into the country, and told
</p>
<p>Lloyd to have the "shooting-irons" and two bottles of whiskey
</p>
<p>ready on that fateful night of the I4th of April. And if she did
</p>
<p>not explain satisfactorily every item of testimony which bore so
</p>
<p>heavily against her, then her last confession was worth nothing.
</p>
<p>Father Walter never had at any time Mrs. Surratt's consent to
</p>
<p>make her confession public, and he dare not do so now after
</p>
<p>twenty-seven years have elapsed since he shrove his unfortunate
</p>
<p>penitent.
</p>
<p>Why, we repeat, did not Father Walter do this? He was
</p>
<p>interesting himself very much in her behalf in trying to get her
</p>
<p>a reprieve ; why did he not use this as an argument with the
</p>
<p>President in her behalf that in her final confession she asserted
</p>
<p>her innocence? Why did he wait until the sentence had been
</p>
<p>confirmed by the President and a full cabinet without a dissenting
</p>
<p>voice, and then had been carried into execution, before he put
</p>
<p>into circulation the story of her confessed innocence? And why
</p>
<p>does he refer to his priestly vows as his excuse for this conduct,
</p>
<p>when he knows full well that having gained Mrs. Surratt's consent
</p>
<p>to make her confession public as an entirety, these vows imposed
</p>
<p>upon him no such restrictions? In vindication of the Commission,
</p>
<p>and also of the court of review, the President and his cabinet,
</p>
<p>we submit that the evidence shows her to have been guilty, no
</p>
<p>matter what she might have said in her final confession.
</p>
<p>Perhaps she had been led to believe that President Lincoln was
</p>
<p>an execrable tyrant, and that his death was no more than that of
</p>
<p>the " meanest nigger in the army." Her remarks to her daughter
</p>
<p>the night her house was searched indicate the views she took of
</p>
<p>the subject. " Anna, come what will, I am resigned. I think
</p>
<p>that Booth was only an instrument in the hands of the Almighty
</p>
<p>to punish this wicked and licentious people." ' To one who could
</p>
<p>have taken this view of the case, Booth's act could not have been

<p>regarded as a crime ; and she who rendered him all the aid she
</p>
<p>could would feel no guilt. They were only co-operating with the
</p>
<p>Almighty in the execution of his vengeance. On the trial of John

</p>
<p>H. Surratt, Mr. Merrick brought Father Walter on to the stand and
</p>
<p>asked him if he had heard the last confession of Mrs. Surratt, to
</p>
<p>which the Father answered, " I did. I gave her communion on
</p>
<p>Friday and prepared her for death."
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick in his argument before the jury said: "I asked
</p>
<p>him ' Did she tell you as she was marching to the scaffold that
</p>
<p>she was an innocent woman ? ' I told him not to answer that
</p>
<p>question before I desired him to. He nodded his head, but. did
</p>
<p>not answer that question, because he had no right, as the other
</p>
<p>side objected." Now what was the object of all this? Mr. Mer-
</p>
<p>rick brought the Father on to the stand and asked him a question
</p>
<p>that had not the slightest relevancy to any issue before that jury.
</p>
<p>He knew, of course, that the prosecution would object, and that
</p>
<p>the question could not be answered. It was a direct question, and
</p>
<p>could have been answered by, "She did" or "She did not." Why
</p>
<p>does not the Father answer at once ? He had been cautioned not
</p>
<p>to do so until desired, and so he waits for the prosecution to
</p>
<p>object and estop him from answering the question. Mr. Merrick,
</p>
<p>however, in his argument assumes that the Father stood ready to
</p>
<p>say that, " She solemnly declared her entire innocence to me in
</p>
<p>her last confession," and throws the responsibility on the other
</p>
<p>side for not getting this answer. The argument was this: "You
</p>
<p>see that Father Walter stood ready to testify to this fact, but the
</p>
<p>prosecution objected, and so he could not do it."
</p>
<p>Now, what has become of the Father's priestly vows behind
</p>
<p>which he has always been hiding? Or was all this a mere piece
</p>
<p>of acting, to give the counsel a point from which to denounce the
</p>
<p>government, the Commission, and all who were concerned in visit-
</p>
<p>ing justice upon the assassins?
</p>
<p>We believe it to be true that the laws of his church did not for-
</p>
<p>bid him to make public, with her consent or command, her last
</p>
<p>confession on this point, and that the Father in making the state-

</p>
<p>ments he does at this late day is simply practicing sleight-of-
</p>
<p>hand upon the public. It is a very strange circumstance, too, that
</p>
<p>whilst Payne, Arnold, O'Laughlin, Atzerodt, and even John H.
</p>
<p>Surratt admitted their connection with cne or the other of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy plots, Mrs. Surratt has not left one word or line after her
</p>
<p>2IO ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>to explain away the incriminating evidence brought against her.
</p>
<p>The reason is plain ; she could not have explained anything with-
</p>
<p>out involving herself and her son, and giving away the whole
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>For twenty-six years Father Walter and his rebel co-adjutors
</p>
<p>have kept a paragraph going the rounds of the papers, stating as
</p>
<p>a fact that all the members of the Commission but one are dead,
</p>
<p>and that they died miserable deaths, which marked them as the
</p>
<p>subjects of heaven's vengeance, and that some of them perished
</p>
<p>from the violence of their own hands, being crazed with remorse.
</p>
<p>The truth" is that at this writing, April, 1892, all of the members
</p>
<p>of the Commission are alive except General Hunter and General
</p>
<p>Ekin. General Hunter lived to over four score years, and General
</p>
<p>Ekin to seventy-three. The present writer is nearly seventy-nine
</p>
<p>and is still able to vindicate the truth in the interest of a true history
</p>
<p>of his period. Is it not high time that the American people should
</p>
<p>be fully informed as to this most important episode in their his-

<p>tory, in order that they may not be misled by men who were not

<p>CONCLUSION.
</p>
<p>Now come the United States and challenge an intelligent and
</p>
<p>candid world to say whether or not, in the light of all this evi-
</p>
<p>dence, they have vindicated their dignity and honor by showing
</p>
<p>that they had just grounds for charging Jefferson Davis, George
</p>
<p>N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson, William C. Cleary,
</p>
<p>Clement C. Clay, George Harper, George Young, and others un-
</p>
<p>known, with combining, confederating and conspiring together with
</p>
<p>one John Wilkes Booth and John Harrison Surratt to kill and
</p>
<p>murder Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, William H. Seward,
</p>
<p>and Ulysses S. Grant, with the intent to subvert the Constitution
</p>
<p>and overthrow the government of the United States in aid of the
</p>
<p>then existing rebellion and as a means of giving it success ; and
</p>
<p>that further, as specified, they, together with John H. Surratt,
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, David E. Herold, George A. Atzerodt, Lewis
</p>
<p>Payne, Mary E. Surratt, Edward Spangler, Samuel Arnold,
</p>
<p>Michael O'Laughlin, and Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, did, on the night
</p>
<p>of the 1 4th day of April, 1865, murder Abraham Lincoln, and did
</p>
<p>attempt to murder William H. Seward, and did lie in wait to
</p>
<p>murder Andrew Johnson, in pursuance of said conspiracy, and in
</p>
<p>the purpose and intent thereof, as therein alleged. And they
</p>
<p>further say, that if, in the light of all this evidence, any persons
</p>
<p>shall feel like erecting a monument to the memory of Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, this is a free country; let them do so, and take the conse-
</p>
<p>quences that cannot fail to result to their reputation and memory
</p>
<p>in the minds of a patriotic, intelligent, and right-minded people,
</p>
<p>reared up under the influences and advantages of our free and
</p>
<p>liberal institutions of civil administration, and of their uplifting
</p>
<p>power and elevating influences on the people, who must, under
</p>
<p>these favoring conditions, ultimately reach the true ideal of human
</p>
<p>development.

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.
</p>
<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN H. SURRATT.
</p>
<p>THE presence of John H. Surratt in Washington City on the day
</p>
<p>of the assassination was proven before the Military Commission
</p>
<p>by a single witness. This witness, however, was a man who was
</p>
<p>personally acquainted with him, and who swore positively to hav-
</p>
<p>ing seen him on that day. His testimony was given about a
</p>
<p>month after the event, and the circumstance was fresh in his mem-
</p>
<p>ory. He stated the time of the day when, and the place where,
</p>
<p>he saw him ; described his dress, the kind of hat he was wearing,
</p>
<p>etc., etc. He was clear in his statements, could have had no
</p>
<p>motives for swearing falsely, and it is scarcely possible that he
</p>
<p>could have been mistaken. From the description given by Ser-
</p>
<p>geant Dye of the man who acted as monitor, calling the time three
</p>
<p>times in succession at short intervals, the last time calling "Ten
</p>
<p>minutes past ten," in front of the theatre, it will be remembered
</p>
<p>that the writer came to the conclusion that this was John H. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt. This conclusion was verified by this same witness on the
</p>
<p>trial of Surratt. Sergeant Dye had taken a seat on the platform
</p>
<p>in front of the theatre, and just before the conclusion of the second
</p>
<p>act of the play had his attention arrested by an elegantly-dressed
</p>
<p>man, who came out of the vestibule, and commenced to converse
</p>
<p>with a ruffianly-looking fellow. Then another joined them, and
</p>
<p>the three conversed together. The one who appeared to be the
</p>
<p>the leader said, " I think he will come out now," referring, as the
</p>
<p>witness supposed, to the President. The President's carriage
</p>
<p>stood near the platform on which the witness was sitting, and one
</p>
<p>of the three passed out as far as the curbstone and looked into
</p>
<p>the carriage. It would seem that they had anticipated the possi-

</p>
<p>bility of his departure at the close of the second act, and had
</p>
<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN H. SURRATT. 21 3
</p>
<p>intended to assassinate him at the moment of his passing out of
</p>
<p>the door. Quite a crowd of people came out at the conclusion
</p>
<p>of the act, and Booth and his companions stood near the door,
</p>
<p>awaiting the opportunity which they sought. When most of the
</p>
<p>crowd had returned into the theatre, and the would-be assassins
</p>
<p>saw that the President would remain until the close of the play,
</p>
<p>they then began to prepare for his assassination in the theatre.
</p>
<p>The writer concludes, from a careful consideration of all the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, that this was a provisional arrangement, in case their
</p>
<p>plan to murder him at the door should fail.
</p>
<p>Booth and the ruffianly-looking fellow kept their stations by the
</p>
<p>door, to make sure of not missing the opportunity of which they
</p>
<p>had planned to avail themselves, whilst the other stepped up and
</p>
<p>looked at the clock in the vestibule, and called the time. He
</p>
<p>then immediately walked rapidly up the street. He returned in
</p>
<p>a few minutes, and looking at the clock again called the time, and
</p>
<p>again walked away rapidly up the street. Very soon he returned
</p>
<p>again, and called the time louder than before, " Ten minutes past
</p>
<p>ten ! " and walking rapidly away, did not return.
</p>
<p>Booth had left the side of his companion before this long
</p>
<p>enough to go into the saloon, where he drank a glass of whiskey,
</p>
<p>and then, as soon as the time had been called the third time, went
</p>
<p>at once into the theatre, and in less than ten minutes thereafter
</p>
<p>fired the fatal shot. It is evident that it had been arranged
</p>
<p>between Booth and Payne that the assassination of Secretary
</p>
<p>Seward should be concurrent with that of President Lincoln ; and
</p>
<p>that a system of signals had been arranged, of which the man who
</p>
<p>called the time was acting as monitor. The suspicions of Ser-
</p>
<p>geant Dye having been aroused by the conduct of these three
</p>
<p>men, he naturally scanned them very closely, and testified that
</p>
<p>he had a good view, not only of the person, but of the face and
</p>
<p>features of the man who called the time, and had his image indeli-
</p>
<p>bly impressed on his memory. Upon being confronted by Sur-

</p>
<p>ratt on his trial, he unhesitatingly and positively declared that he
</p>
<p>was the man. In addition to Reed and Dye, who testified before
</p>
<p>the Commission, there were nine others who testified on the trial
</p>
<p>of Surratt to having seen him that day in the City of Washington.
</p>
<p>214 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>All of these persons, except four, were personally acquainted with
</p>
<p>him, and could not have been mistaken, as they were able to give
</p>
<p>the time of day when, and the place where, they saw him, as also,
</p>
<p>in the case of most of them, to describe his person, dress, hat,
</p>
<p>moustache, etc., etc., without any discrepancies in their testimony.
</p>
<p>The other four, though not acquainted with him, identified him
</p>
<p>before the jury, more or less positively, as the man they had seen.
</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that though they all testified with more
</p>
<p>or less of particularity in their descriptions of his person, his dress,
</p>
<p>his hat, his moustache, and as to the time of day when, and the
</p>
<p>place where, they had seen him, there was nothing incongruous or
</p>
<p>contradictory in their testimony. One witness, a colored woman,
</p>
<p>Susan Ann Jackson, who was in service at Mrs. Surratt's at
</p>
<p>the time, and had been for three or four weeks previous to the
</p>
<p>assassination, testified that under the direction of Mrs. Surratt she
</p>
<p>had made tea for the prisoner after the family and boarders had
</p>
<p>left the table on the night of the assassination, and that Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt had said to her on that occasion, " This is my son," and
</p>
<p>had asked her if he did not look like Annie. She said this was
</p>
<p>the first and only time she had seen him until she met him on his
</p>
<p>trial, and then she positively identified him as the man she had
</p>
<p>waited upon that night. The time was impressed on her memory
</p>
<p>by its being Good Friday, and the night of the assassination.
</p>
<p>Several of the witnesses who testified to his presence in the city
</p>
<p>on that day also testified that they saw him in company with
</p>
<p>Booth, and one, at least, with Booth and O'Laughlin. Surratt
</p>
<p>himself told his old acquaintance, St. Marie, with whom he renewed
</p>
<p>his acquaintanceship in the ranks of the Papal Zouaves at Velletri,
</p>
<p>in Italy, that he left Washington early on the morning of the I5th
</p>
<p>of April, disguised as an English tourist ; and that he had a very
</p>
<p>hard time to make his escape. As the trains leaving Washington
</p>
<p>for Baltimore on the morning of the 1 5th were thoroughly scru-
</p>
<p>tinized by the police before being permitted to leave, it is uncer-

</p>
<p>tain whether Surratt's disguise sufficed to get him through, or
</p>
<p>whether he went a part or all of the way to Baltimore on horse-
</p>
<p>back. There was some evidence on this trial tending to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion that he had escaped from the city on horseback. The
</p>
<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN H. SURRATT. 21$
</p>
<p>next place we get track of him in his flight is at the railroad
</p>
<p>depot at Burlington, Vt., on the early morning of the i8th of
</p>
<p>April. Here he turns up with a rough-looking man, no doubt
</p>
<p>the ruffianly-looking fellow who was seen with him and Booth in
</p>
<p>front of the theatre on the night of the assassination. They had
</p>
<p>crossed Lake Champlain on a boat that ran from White Hall to
</p>
<p>Rouse's Point, on the night of the i/th, and landed at Burlington,
</p>
<p>in order to take the train to Montreal. This was the first trip the
</p>
<p>boat had made that season, and it was four hours late in reaching
</p>
<p>Burlington, arriving there about midnight. They had to wait for
</p>
<p>the morning train, which was due at four o'clock A.M. of the i8th.
</p>
<p>They requested permission to sleep at the depot, and the night
</p>
<p>watchman allowed them to sleep on the benches. He awakened
</p>
<p>them in time for the train, and after daylight, when sweeping the
</p>
<p>floor, he found a handkerchief under the bench where the taller of
</p>
<p>the two had slept, and upon examining it after it was fairly light
</p>
<p>found it marked, "J. H. Surratt 2." At Essex Junction, where
</p>
<p>they changed trains for St. Albans, these two travellers made the
</p>
<p>change, and were found by the conductor on his passing through
</p>
<p>the train standing on the platform outside. He asked them for
</p>
<p>their fare, and was told that they had no money. Surratt did all
</p>
<p>the talking. He represented that they were laboring men, had
</p>
<p>been at work in New York, and had been unfortunate and lost
</p>
<p>their money. He said they were now making their way back to
</p>
<p>Canada, and were ready to promise that if he would carry them
</p>
<p>through they would send him the fare as soon as they reached
</p>
<p>their friends. The conductor reminded them of the necessity of
</p>
<p>having money if they would travel.
</p>
<p>Surratt disguised his speech, trying to use the dialect of a
</p>
<p>Canadian ; but when he became excited from fear of being put
</p>
<p>off the train he forgot his Cannuck, and talked in good square
</p>
<p>English. The conductor also noticed that his hands were not
</p>
<p>those of a laboring man, and so concluded that the men were traveling

</p>
<p>incognito. This was on the early morning of the i8th of April.
</p>
<p>They arrived at St. Albans for breakfast. At the table they
</p>
<p>found everybody excited, and upon Surratt's inquiring what it
</p>
<p>meant, his next neighbor at the table, an old gentleman, informed
</p>
<p>2l6 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>him that the President had been assassinated, to which Surratt
</p>
<p>replied that " The news was too good to be true." The old
</p>
<p>gentleman then handed him a paper, and on looking it over he
</p>
<p>saw his own name given as one of the assassins. He dropped the
</p>
<p>paper, and found that he did not want any more breakfast. On
</p>
<p>passing out into the next room, he heard some one say that Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt must be in town, or had passed through, as his handkerchief
</p>
<p>had been found in the street; when, upon feeling for his hand-
</p>
<p>kerchief, he found that he had lost it. They then left the place as
</p>
<p>quickly as possible, narrowly escaping arrest. He understood
</p>
<p>that his handkerchief had been picked up in the street of St.
</p>
<p>Albans, and no doubt, in the excitement, the news had taken
</p>
<p>that shape, but, as we have seen, he lost it at Burlington depot,
</p>
<p>and so the news must have been telegraphed to St. Albans.
</p>
<p>It is not known how they traveled from St. Albans to Mont-
</p>
<p>real, but it is most probable that they walked across the coun-
</p>
<p>try. We find Surratt's name on the hotel register at Montreal,
</p>
<p>where he arrived at about two o'clock on the i8th of April, he
</p>
<p>having been absent from that place from the I2th. This had
</p>
<p>been to him an eventful week, full of difficulties and hazards ; but
</p>
<p>he may now feel safe, as he has reached the abode of the chief
</p>
<p>conspirators, his employers, and is ready to claim his reward.
</p>
<p>He can feel that he is in the midst of sympathizing friends.
</p>
<p>But, alas ! a criminal can never feel safe. An angry God is ever
</p>
<p>on the track of the guilty conscience. As it was with the first
</p>
<p>murderer, so it must be with every murderer, a fugitive and a
</p>
<p>vagabond he is compelled to be. He had hardly recorded his
</p>
<p>name on the hotel register when he was informed that detectives
</p>
<p>were on the look-out for him, and he was at once spirited away
</p>
<p>to the house of a Mr. Porterfield. This man was a Southerner,
</p>
<p>who belonged to Thompson's cabal, but who had abjured his
</p>
<p>allegiance to his country and taken the oath of allegiance to the
</p>

<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN H. SURRATT. 217
</p>
<p>took Surratt into his house, and kept him secreted there for
</p>
<p>several days. Finding the detectives who were in pursuit of the
</p>
<p>fugitive vigilant and determined in their search, Porterfield became
</p>
<p>fearful that he could not keep his charge concealed, and so made
</p>
<p>arrangements to get him into a place of greater security.
</p>
<p>At this point we meet with a new element amongst the Canada
</p>
<p>conspirators, viz., the Roman Catholic priesthood. Porterfield had
</p>
<p>arranged with Father Boucher to take his charge in custody, and
</p>
<p>keep him concealed. This Father was rector of the parish of St.
</p>
<p>Liboire, a newly-settled place, about forty-five miles from Montreal
</p>
<p>an out-of-the-way place, and so a good place in which to hide
</p>
<p>him away. The arrangements had been made in advance with this
</p>
<p>Father to take charge of Surratt, and keep him secreted at his
</p>
<p>house. He was conveyed there by one )oseph F. Du Tilley, who
</p>
<p>seems to have been priest Boucher's right hand man. The strata-
</p>
<p>gem to get him away from Montreal was as follows : two carriages
</p>
<p>drove up in front of Porterfield's house late in the afternoon, when
</p>
<p>two persons, dressed as nearly as possible alike, went out together ;
</p>
<p>one of these got into one of the carriages, and the other into the
</p>
<p>other, when they drove away in different directions. Father
</p>
<p>Boucher appeared at the trial of Surratt as a voluntary witness
</p>
<p>for the defense, and without any apparent sense of shame con-
</p>
<p>victed himself, by his own testimony, of being an accomplice after
</p>
<p>the fact. We think that the testimony he gave warrants the con-
</p>
<p>clusion, also, that another priest, Father La Pierre, placed him-
</p>
<p>self in the same category. Both of these Fathers took Surratt
</p>
<p>into their houses, and kept him concealed, the first for three,
</p>
<p>and the latter for two months, knowing him to be charged with
</p>
<p>being a conspirator to the assassination of the President of the
</p>
<p>United States.
</p>
<p>Father Boucher's parish being in an out-of-the-way country
</p>
<p>place, it was only necessary that he should constantly exercise a
</p>
<p>prudent vigilance in behalf of his charge. He was visited fre-

</p>
<p>quently by his friends whilst staying with Boucher ; at one time
</p>
<p>three or four of these came together, and stayed three or four,
</p>
<p>days with him. The time was spent in hunting, sporting, and
</p>
<p>revelry. It was very remarkable, however, that Father Boucher
</p>
<p>2l8 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>could not remember the names of any of these friends. Being a
</p>
<p>volunteer witness for the defense, he could not give their names
</p>
<p>without implicating persons whom he did not desire to com-
</p>
<p>promise ; hence, no doubt, his convenient Jesuitical failure of
</p>
<p>memory. Perhaps he could not have given their names without
</p>
<p>injury to the cause he desired to help. He could only say that
</p>
<p>some of their names were English names, using the word English
</p>
<p>in contra distinction from French or French-Canadian, in which
</p>
<p>sense it implied not really English, but American, Beverly
</p>
<p>Tucker for instance, perhaps Porterfield, and likely, also, La Pierre.
</p>
<p>As two of these, Beverly Tucker and La Pierre, along with Boucher,
</p>
<p>accompanied Surratt from Montreal to Quebec, and did not leave
</p>
<p>him until they had seen him safe on board the ocean steamer,
</p>
<p>" Peruvian," when he finally was sent to Europe, it would seem
</p>
<p>highly probable that we have rightly surmised who were his vis-
</p>
<p>itors on the occasion referred to. Surratt was not kept in close
</p>
<p>confinement by Father Boucher, but his safety from discovery
</p>
<p>and arrest was looked after with cunning vigilance. At length
</p>
<p>the time came when it was thought safe and advisable to transfer
</p>
<p>the fugitive back to Montreal. This was affected as secretly as
</p>
<p>had been his removal from that place to the parish of St. Liboire.
</p>
<p>Father La Pierre now took him in charge. He had provided
</p>
<p>for him a secluded upstairs room at his father's house, right wider
</p>
<p>the shadow of the bishop 's window. This Father had been a visitor
</p>
<p>of Surratt at the lonely parish of St. Liboire, and now took him
</p>
<p>under his especial protection. He kept him concealed, and never
</p>
<p>allowed him to go out until after nightfall, and then never alone,
</p>
<p>but always accompanied him. La Pierre thus kept his charge
</p>
<p>safely from the latter part of July until the 5th of September,
</p>
<p>1865. During all of this time he was visited regularly twice a
</p>
<p>week, on Mondays and Thursdays, by Father Boucher, who always
</p>
<p>remained over night with him at each visit. How can we account
</p>
<p>for this great interest taken by these two priests in secreting the

</p>
<p>murderer of the head of the greatest nation on earth, and that
</p>
<p>with a full knowledge that he stood charged with this crime, and
</p>
<p>that a great reward was offered for his apprehension? How can
</p>
<p>we consider them less guilty, in a moral point of view, than Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt himself?
</p>
<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN //. SURRATT. 219
</p>
<p>But at length a time came when it was thought safe and
</p>
<p>advisable to send him abroad.
</p>
<p>Early in September Father La Pierre sought an interview with
</p>
<p>Dr. Lewis J. A. McMillen, surgeon on board the ocean steamer
</p>
<p>" Peruvian," which was to sail on the i6th of that month from
</p>
<p>Quebec for Liverpool, and made arrangements to put in his care
</p>
<p>for the passage a friend of his by the name of McCarthy, who,
</p>
<p>for certain reasons, desired to embark secretly on the voyage.
</p>
<p>The doctor took a steamer at Montreal, on the I5th, to join his
</p>
<p>ship, which was to sail on the following day.
</p>
<p>Boucher and La Pierre conveyed Surratt in a covered carriage,
</p>
<p>and went with him on board the same steamer on which the
</p>
<p>doctor had taken passage. La Pierre was in disguise, inasmuch
</p>
<p>as he was dressed in citizen's dress. They had also disguised
</p>
<p>Surratt by coloring his hair, painting his face, and putting spec-
</p>
<p>tacles over his eyes. On the passage from Montreal to Quebec,
</p>
<p>they kept him locked up in the state-room occupied jointly by
</p>
<p>him and Father La Pierre. When they reached Quebec and went
</p>
<p>on board the transport that was to convey them to the ocean
</p>
<p>steamer " Peruvian," in which they were to sail, the doctor was
</p>
<p>there introduced to Beverly Tucker, who had also felt enough of
</p>
<p>interest in Surratt's case to induce him to accompany him from
</p>
<p>Montreal to Quebec, and who stood in that relation to his case'in
</p>
<p>the knowledge of Fathers La Pierre and Boucher that they could
</p>
<p>safely take him into their confidence in their plans for conveying
</p>
<p>Surratt out of the country. This trio saw Surratt safely on board
</p>
<p>the " Peruvian," and then bade him good-by. The interest thus
</p>
<p>manifested by Tucker in getting Surratt safely away confirms the
</p>
<p>testimony given before the Military Commission, showing him to
</p>
<p>have been justly charged by the government with being a member
</p>
<p>of the great conspiracy. Before parting from his charge Father
</p>
<p>La Pierre requested Dr. McMillen to let Surratt stay in his room
</p>
<p>until after the vessel should have sailed.

</p>
<p>Surratt is not an innocent man carrying a good conscience,
</p>
<p>that enables him to look every man he meets squarely in the face.
</p>
<p>He is a fugitive and a vagabond, carrying the weight of a terrible
</p>
<p>crime in his memory a weight that neither time nor distance
</p>
<p>22O ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>can efface. He is haunted by his fears, having before him the
</p>
<p>vision of a detective and of capture ; and so he skulks and hides
</p>
<p>from the phantom of an American detective which he cannot
</p>
<p>banish from his mind.
</p>
<p>The vessel being now on her way, and in British waters, the
</p>
<p>fugitive ventured forth, and naturally sought the company of the
</p>
<p>surgeon of the vessel in whose care he had been placed, and
</p>
<p>whom he regarded as his friend. His social nature yearned for
</p>
<p>companionship, and all the more as a means of relief from a
</p>
<p>guilty conscience. Does he now enjoy a sense of security? To
</p>
<p>him this is impossible. He scanned closely every passenger he
</p>
<p>met, that phantom of a detective being ever present to his
</p>
<p>imagination. He sees a gentleman whom he takes to be an
</p>
<p>American. He seeks his friend McMillen, and discloses to him
</p>
<p>his fears, saying: "I think that man is an American detective."
</p>
<p>Upon being asked by the doctor what he had done that he should
</p>
<p>be afraid of a detective, he replied : "If you knew all the things I
</p>
<p>have done, it would make you stare." Murder is a crime that
</p>
<p>will out. It imposes a weight of guilt upon the conscience that
</p>
<p>will, at some unguarded moment, let the fearful secret slip through
</p>
<p>the door of the lips that are most firmly closed by a purpose of
</p>
<p>concealment. The doctor reassurred him, by reminding him that
</p>
<p>he was on board a British ship sailing on British waters, and that
</p>
<p>he had nothing to fear from an American detective. Surratt then
</p>
<p>drew a small four-barrelled revolver from his vest pocket, and
</p>
<p>remarked : " I don't care ; this will settle him." The doctor now
</p>
<p>began to feel a great interest in his charge, arising from the sus-
</p>
<p>picion that he was John H. Surratt. The voyage across the
</p>
<p>Atlantic occupied nine or ten days. The fugitive was so full of
</p>
<p>his terrible secret that he could not keep quiet. Every day he
</p>
<p>sought opportunities to converse with the doctor privately, and at
</p>
<p>every interview the history of his crimes kept leaking out. He
</p>
<p>was nervous, and constantly haunted by his fears ; so that he

</p>
<p>could never hear any one coming up behind him without starting
</p>
<p>and looking around. Amongst his important revelations to the
</p>
<p>doctor were the following : that he had for a considerable time
</p>
<p>previously to the assassination been a bearer of despatches from
</p>
<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN If. SURRATT. 221
</p>
<p>Richmond to the Confederate agents in Canada; that he had at
</p>
<p>one time carried to them from Richmond thirty thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>and at another time seventy thousand dollars ; that he arrived in
</p>
<p>Montreal the last time on the 6th of April, with despatches from
</p>
<p>Davis and Benjamin, thus confirming the testimony of Conover
</p>
<p>and Merritt before the Military Commission. These despatches
</p>
<p>he claimed to have delivered to Thompson. After the military
</p>
<p>trial, and previous to the trial of Surratt, the witness, Conover,
</p>
<p>had been convicted of perjury; but this does not discredit the
</p>
<p>testimony he gave before the Commission, as it was confirmed by
</p>
<p>other witnesses who stand unimpeached, and is here also con-
</p>
<p>firmed by Surratt himself in regard to one of its most important
</p>
<p>points. It will be remembered that Conover testified to having
</p>
<p>been present at a meeting of the Canada conspirators in Montreal,
</p>
<p>on the 6th of April, 1865, and that John H. Surratt, who was
</p>
<p>present, had just arrived from Richmond, bringing a cipher
</p>
<p>despatch from Jefferson Davis, and also a despatch from his
</p>
<p>Secretary of State, Benjamin, and that Thompson, laying his
</p>
<p>hand on these despatches, said : " This makes the thing all
</p>
<p>right " ; and that active measures were at once entered upon for
</p>
<p>putting the assassination plot into effect. Now Surratt comes to
</p>
<p>McMillen five months later, on the face of the broad Atlantic, and
</p>
<p>confirms Conover's testimony in its major part. He also related
</p>
<p>to the doctor the particulars of his trip to Richmond late in
</p>
<p>March, 1865, when he was accompanied by a woman, who by
</p>
<p>other testimony was shown to have been Mrs. Slater, alias Brown,
</p>
<p>the rebel spy and blockade runner. The arrangement was made
</p>
<p>whilst he was in Canada for him to meet her in New York and
</p>
<p>accompany her to Richmond, which he did, passing through
</p>
<p>Washington. In this statement the testimony of Wiechmann is
</p>
<p>confirmed. Surratt related to the doctor the difficulty they had
</p>
<p>in crossing the Potomac. They were hailed by a gun-boat, and
</p>
<p>called upon to surrender. They said they would do so, but
</p>

</p>
<p>waited for the small boat that had been sent to bring them, in to
</p>
<p>come alongside, when they suddenly arose, poured a volley into
</p>
<p>the crew of the small boat, and then, in the confusion that ensued,
</p>
<p>made their escape. There were twelve or fifteen crossing with
</p>
<p>222 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>him at the time, and all were armed with revolvers. Having
</p>
<p>gotten within the Confederate lines south of Fredericksburg, they
</p>
<p>were being pushed along by negroes on a hand-car when they
</p>
<p>met five or six forlorn, half-starved Union soldiers, who had made
</p>
<p>their escape from a rebel prison and were striking for freedom.
</p>
<p>At the suggestion of this wicked woman they shot them down,
</p>
<p>and passed on, leaving them lying on the ground.
</p>
<p>He also related to the doctor the plot, at one time discussed, to
</p>
<p>capture the President and carry him to Richmond, but said it was
</p>
<p>found to be impracticable, and so was abandoned. He claimed
</p>
<p>that Booth and himself had spent ten thousand dollars in prepara-
</p>
<p>tions for carrying out their plot. When we remember that neither
</p>
<p>Booth nor Surratt had any means of their own, and yet were car-
</p>
<p>rying on an enterprise that called for so large an outlay of money,
</p>
<p>we may well ask who stood behind them and furnished the funds?
</p>
<p>But if we take all of the testimony we have before us into con-
</p>
<p>sideration we need have no difficulty in answering this question.
</p>
<p>Jacob Thompson was the treasurer of the concern, and his govern-
</p>
<p>ment kept him amply supplied with means. It will be remembered
</p>
<p>that Clay said, " We have plenty of money to pay for anything
</p>
<p>that is worth paying for." After the assassination Surratt was
</p>
<p>in some way supplied with money to support him for a year, and
</p>
<p>carry him to Italy. In regard to the assassination, Surratt told
</p>
<p>McMillen that he received a letter from Booth at Montreal, in the
</p>
<p>beginning of the week of the assassination, which was written in
</p>
<p>New York, calling him to Washington at once, as it had become
</p>
<p>necessary to change their plans and to act. quickly. He started at
</p>
<p>once, and telegraphed Booth at New York City from Elmira, but
</p>
<p>found that he had already gone to Washington. In regard to his
</p>
<p>escape from Washington after the assassination, he related all of
</p>
<p>the incidents that have already been given in regard to his experi-
</p>
<p>ence at St. Albans, the loss of his handkerchief, his hasty depart-
</p>
<p>ure from that place, etc., etc.

</p>
<p>Every day during the voyage, he was filling McMillen's ears with
</p>
<p>these stories, and as they neared the end of the voyage he began
</p>
<p>to revolve in his mind whether he would land on the Irish coast or
</p>
<p>go on to Liverpool. He asked McMillen which he had better do,
</p>
<p>FLIGHT AND CAPTURE OF JOHN H. SURRATT. 22$
</p>
<p>but McMillan, who must have known by this time who this
</p>
<p>McCarthy was, declined to give him any advice. Surratt finally
</p>
<p>said he would go on to Liverpool, but could not dismiss from his
</p>
<p>mind the fear that he might there meet a detective awaiting his
</p>
<p>arrival. Pulling out his revolver, he said, " If he did, this would
</p>
<p>settle him." Upon McMillen making the reply that " they would
</p>
<p>make short work of it with him in England if he should do such a
</p>
<p>thing as that," he said, "It is for that very reason I would do it, for
</p>
<p>I would rather be hung by an English than a Yankee hangman,
</p>
<p>and I know I would be hung should I be taken back to the
</p>
<p>United States." Upon sighting the coast of Ireland he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Here is a foreign country at last ! I only wish that I may live
</p>
<p>two years to go back to the United States and serve Andy Johnson
</p>
<p>as we served Lincoln."
</p>
<p>When the " Peruvian " was about to land her passengers and
</p>
<p>mail at an Irish port, Surratt sent for McMillen, and upon the latter
</p>
<p>expressing surprise at finding him dressed, and prepared to land,
</p>
<p>saying that " he thought he had concluded to go on with them to
</p>
<p>Liverpool," Surratt replied, "that he had thought the matter over
</p>
<p>carefully, and had concluded that it would be safer for him to land
</p>
<p>there, as it was then nearly midnight." McMillen then said to him,
</p>
<p>" You have been telling me a great many things, and I have come
</p>
<p>to the conclusion that the name by which you were introduced to
</p>
<p>me is not your true name. Will you be kind enough to tell me who
</p>
<p>you are?" The fugitive then whispered in his ear, " I am Surratt."
</p>
<p>He then asked the doctor to send for the barkeeper, and before
</p>
<p>leaving the ship drank so freely of brandy that the doctor found
</p>
<p>it necessary to request the chief officer at the gangway to take him
</p>
<p>by the arm and see him safely on shore. On the Wednesday fol-
</p>
<p>lowing, Surratt called on the doctor at his boarding house in Birk-
</p>
<p>enhead, opposite the city of Liverpool, and requested him to go-
</p>
<p>over with him to the city to find a house to which he had been
</p>
<p>directed to go. The doctor had, on the previous day (which was

</p>
<p>the day after the " Peruvian " had landed in Liverpool), visited the
</p>
<p>Vice-Consul of the United States, Mr. Wildings, and made a sworn
</p>
<p>statement of the facts that Surratt had revealed to him, his purpose
</p>
<p>being to aid the United States in securing his arrest. He told the
</p>
<p>224 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Vice-Consul that he was only making a partial statement of Surratt's
</p>
<p>confessions during the voyage, deeming it only important that the
</p>
<p>government should be informed of Surratt's arrival in Liverpool.
</p>
<p>The doctor testified, on Surratt's trial, that Mr. Wilding told him
</p>
<p>that he had been informed by Mr. Adams, the American Minister
</p>
<p>at London, that the government was not going to prosecute Surratt ;
</p>
<p>that it hadn't anything against him.
</p>
<p>Of all this Surratt was ignorant, and the doctor went with him,
</p>
<p>as requested, across the river from Birkenhead to Liverpool, and
</p>
<p>finding a cab, gave the driver directions where to take him, and
</p>
<p>then parted from him. Surratt visited him again before the doctor
</p>
<p>started on the return voyage, and requested him to see a party
</p>
<p>in Montreal, and bring him some money. The doctor did as re-
</p>
<p>quested, but . the person on whom he was requested to call said
</p>
<p>he had no money for him. The rebellion had collapsed ; the plot
</p>
<p>had failed of its purpose, as it had also failed in part of its fulfill-
</p>
<p>ment ; and now Surratt was to suffer the fate of Hyams be
</p>
<p>shaken off and disowned. On the doctor's return to Liverpool
</p>
<p>Surratt called on him, but only to learn that there was no money
</p>
<p>for him. This was the last time that McMillen saw him until he
</p>
<p>saw him on his trial.
</p>
<p>Surratt is next found in Italy, in the army of the Pope, where
</p>
<p>he had enlisted as a soldier in the ninth company of Zouaves
</p>
<p>about the middle of April, 1866. He had found friends after his
</p>
<p>escape from Washington, who had supported him, kept him
</p>
<p>secreted, watched over his safety, planned his trip from Mon-
</p>
<p>treal to Italy, and furnished him money for the expenses of his
</p>
<p>journey; friends who, no doubt, were accomplices before, as
</p>
<p>well as after, the fact, for we find them waiting and watching for
</p>
<p>his return to Montreal after the assassination, and ready to hurry
</p>
<p>him off into seclusion. He was to them a stranger ; only known
</p>
<p>to them as a fugitive from his country, charged with the highest
</p>
<p>crime that a man could commit, a blow at the nation's life, by

<p>Certainly he may now feel safe, being hid away under the alias

<p>of Watson, in the ranks of the Papal Zouaves, in the town of Vel-

<p>He said he left disguised as an English traveler and succeeded in

<p>making his way out.
</p>
<p>The American Consul was informed of his whereabouts, and
</p>
<p>upon the matter being brought to the notice of the Pope through
</p>
<p>Cardinal Antonelli, an order was issued for his arrest 'and delivery

<p>comrades in the service, and kept under guard, but succeeded
</p>
<p>in making his escape from his guards (if we may believe the
</p>
<p>story), by making a bold dash down a precipice, at the risk
</p>
<p>of his life. Having thus escaped he made his way to Naples, and

<p>thence to Alexandria, in Egypt. What must have been his sur-
</p>

<p>arrival, and ready to make him a prisoner. He was put in chains,

<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL.
</p>
<p>ON the 4th day of February, 1867, the grand jury for the
</p>
<p>county of Washington, District of Columbia, found an indict-
</p>
<p>ment against John H. Surratt for the murder of Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln. The indictment contained four counts. The first count
</p>
<p>charged him with the murder of one Abraham Lincoln at the
</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>county of Washington, District of Columbia, on the I4th day of
</p>
<p>April, 1865. The second count charged that John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>and John Wilkes Booth did, on the I4th day of April, 1865, make
</p>
<p>an assault upon one Abraham Lincoln in the county and district
</p>
<p>aforesaid, and that John Wilkes Booth did murder the said Abra-
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>The third count charged that John H. Surratt and John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, David E. Herold, George A. Atzerodt, Lewis Payne, Mary
</p>
<p>E. Surratt, and others to the jury unknown, did, on the I4th day
</p>
<p>of April, 1865, in the county and district aforesaid, make an
</p>
<p>assault upon one Abraham Lincoln, and that he was murdered by
</p>
<p>the hand of John Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>The fourth count charged that John Wilkes Booth, John H.
</p>
<p>Surratt, David E. Herold, George A. Atzerodt, Lewis Payne,
</p>
<p>Mary E. Surratt, and divers other persons to the jury unknown,
</p>
<p>on the 1 4th day of April, 1865, at the county of Washington,
</p>
<p>District of Columbia, did unlawfully and wickedly combine, con-
</p>
<p>federate, and conspire and agree together feloniously to kill and
</p>
<p>murder one Abraham Lincoln, and that the said John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, John H. Surratt, David E. Herold, George A. Atzerodt,
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne, Mary E. Surratt, and other persons to the jurors
</p>
<p>unknown, did, on the I4th day of April, 1865, in pursuance of
</p>
<p>said unlawful conspiracy, make an assault, and that the said John

</p>
<p>23O ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, in pursuance of said unlawful and wicked conspiracy,
</p>
<p>did kill and murder one Abraham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>It will be noticed that the legal allegations designating the
</p>
<p>crime used in this indictment are the same as are used in the
</p>
<p>charge and specfications on which Surratt's co-conspirators were
</p>
<p>arraigned and tried before the Commission, except that the word
</p>
<p>" traitorously," there used, is omitted in this indictment. This
</p>
<p>indictment in its first count charged the prisoner on trial with the
</p>
<p>murder of Abraham Lincoln. This was done on the principle
</p>
<p>that when two or more persons conspire together to do an unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful act, or to do that which is lawful by unlawful means, the
</p>
<p>act of any one of the parties thus conspiring, in pursuance of said
</p>
<p>conspiracy becomes the act of all. They are held equally guilty
</p>
<p>in law. To make this count good, it was only necessary to prove
</p>
<p>the existence of a conspiracy to do this murder that it was done
</p>
<p>by one of the conspirators, and that the person indicted was a
</p>
<p>member of said conspiracy at the time the murder was committed,
</p>
<p>and that he aided and abetted and performed his part, whatever
</p>
<p>that might be, in accomplishing the object of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The second count charges that Surratt and Booth murdered
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, and that the murder was actually accomplished
</p>
<p>by the hand of Booth. This implies that they acted together for
</p>
<p>the accomplishment of the crime and would be made good only
</p>
<p>by proving the presence of John H. Surratt at the time and place
</p>
<p>of its commisson, and that he was there aiding and abetting Booth
</p>
<p>in the alleged murder. The third count simply enlarges the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy by designating others known to have been included in its
</p>
<p>membership, alleging also, that there were still others belonging
</p>
<p>to it, who were unknown to the jury, and that in pursuance of its
</p>
<p>object and purpose the murder was done by the hand of one of
</p>
<p>its members.
</p>
<p>The fourth count more distinctly and emphatically alleges the
</p>
<p>combining, confederating, conspiring, and agreeing together of
</p>

</p>
<p>these persons to do this murder, and that it was so done by one
</p>
<p>of its members, viz., Booth. This would require proof to be
</p>
<p>made of such combination and agreeing together to commit this
</p>
<p>crime on the part of the persons named in the indictment ; that
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 2$ I
</p>
<p>the crime was perpetrated, and that the prisoner was a member of
</p>
<p>said conspiracy at the time of its perpetration. It will be
</p>
<p>remarked that in addition to the word " traitorously," used in the
</p>
<p>charge and specifications against the members of this conspiracy
</p>
<p>who were tried before the Commission, the political purpose of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, as there alleged, is here omitted.
</p>
<p>The real purpose of the conspiracy was to aid the existing
</p>
<p>rebellion in its purpose and effort to overthrow the govern-
</p>
<p>ment by assassinating the President, Vice-President, Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, and the general in command of the armies of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>The parties tried before a military commission were tried under
</p>
<p>the laws of war, during a state of war, and were brought under
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of a military tribunal because they were secret
</p>
<p>active enemies of the government, and were engaged in an effort
</p>
<p>to aid the rebellion. This required that the word traitorously
</p>
<p>should be used, and that the treasonable purpose of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy should be alleged. This member of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>was indicted for his participation in this crime ; but he had made
</p>
<p>good his escape, and had not been brought within the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of the authorities that could hold him to account until long after
</p>
<p>the rebellion had been suppressed, and peace had been declared ;
</p>
<p>and under the political policy which had been adopted by the
</p>
<p>government in dealing with the question of treason and traitors in
</p>
<p>connection with the war, he could only be indicted for his crime,
</p>
<p>as it was a violation of civil law. Hence these omissions in
</p>
<p>framing this indictment.
</p>
<p>The case is unique in the history of American jurisprudence.
</p>
<p>A number of his co-conspirators had been tried before a military
</p>
<p>commission under an arraignment that fully set forth, not only the
</p>
<p>crime of murder and a conspiracy to murder, but also the fact
</p>
<p>that it involved much more than the mere killing of a man a
</p>
<p>private individual that it was a conspiracy to murder the

<p>President of the United States, a treasonable conspiracy to sub-
</p>
<p>vert the government. It was a blow aimed at the nation's life.
</p>
<p>He who murders the humblest citizen sets at naught God's image
</p>
<p>impressed on man at his creation, and so commits a crime not
</p>
<p>232 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN,
</p>
<p>only against a fellow man and a crime against society, but a
</p>
<p>crime against God. When Noah became the new head and pro-
</p>
<p>genitor of the race after the flood, God, who had just destroyed
</p>
<p>the world of mankind because they had filled the world with
</p>
<p>violence and blood, gave this law: "Whoso sheddeth man's blood
</p>
<p>by man shall his blood be shed ; for in the image of God created
</p>
<p>he him." God is also the author of civil government, as we read
</p>
<p>in the thirteenth of Romans : " Let every soul be subject to the
</p>
<p>higher powers, for there is no power but of God. The powers
</p>
<p>that be are ordained of God." Here we learn that civil government
</p>
<p>is the ordinance of God ; and so he who assassinates a ruler, not
</p>
<p>only sets at naught God's image in man, but despises his
</p>
<p>ordinance for the welfare, protection, and peace of society.
</p>
<p>This treasonable aspect of his crime, although it could not, for
</p>
<p>the reasons stated, be embraced in his indictment, yet, as we
</p>
<p>shall see, was a matter of which the court and jury could take
</p>
<p>judicial cognizance.
</p>
<p>Here we have a man on trial for participation in the murder of
</p>
<p>a President; yet, in his indictment, he is only charged with
</p>
<p>the murder of one Abraham Lincoln. His fellow conspirators
</p>
<p>had been convicted of murdering Abraham Lincoln, President of
</p>
<p>the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the armies and
</p>
<p>navy of the United States, and of attempting to kill William H.
</p>
<p>Seward, Secretary of State of the United States, and lying in wait
</p>
<p>to kill Andrew Johnson, Vice-President of the United States, and
</p>
<p>Ulysses S. Grant, commander in the field of the armies of the
</p>
<p>United States, for the purpose of overthrowing the government of
</p>
<p>the United States in aid of the existing rebellion. Under this
</p>
<p>charge they had been condemned and some of them executed.
</p>
<p>This was the result of a military trial in time of war.
</p>
<p>This trial had been denounced by every rebel sympathizer in
</p>
<p>the land. Great lawyers and statesmen had argued with
</p>
<p>vehemence that these assassins had been tried by an unconstitu-

</p>
<p>tional tribunal. The dead President had been denounced as a
</p>
<p>tyrant, and usurper of authority ; one who had trampled under
</p>
<p>foot the Constitution he had sworn to protect and defend by pro-
</p>
<p>claiming martial law, and suspending the writ of habeas corpus;
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 233
</p>
<p>and even in prosecuting a war to compel rebellious States to
</p>
<p>submit to the lawful authority of the government, and now they
</p>
<p>would tie up the hands of the government by insisting that it could
</p>
<p>only try these traitorous assassins, constitutionally, before a civil
</p>
<p>court. The country stood divided on this contention, just as it did on
</p>
<p>the issues of the war, and partisan feeling ran as high in this discus-
</p>
<p>sion as it did on the right of secession or the right of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment to compel submission to its authority.
</p>
<p>The sophistry of this reasoning, when applied to a time of war,
</p>
<p>was made apparent by the results of this trial of John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>before a civil court, in time of peace. No government could pro-
</p>
<p>tect itself under such a construction of the Constitution, because
</p>
<p>no government could ever convict a traitorous assassin before a
</p>
<p>jury made up of its enemies as well as its friends.
</p>
<p>This trial necessarily aroused the passions and prejudices
</p>
<p>engendered by the war that gave occasion for the crime of the
</p>
<p>prisoner, and could not be conducted on a strictly judicial and
</p>
<p>legal basis. It was just as impossible now, almost two years after
</p>
<p>the close of the war, as it would have been at the time of the trial
</p>
<p>by a military commission of Surratt's fellows in crime ; and a con-
</p>
<p>viction by a jury in a civil court was just as impossible now as it
</p>
<p>would have been then because a jury of partisans embracing those
</p>
<p>of both sides politically can never be expected to come to an
</p>
<p>agreement in a case that appeals to their partisan feelings. This
</p>
<p>case was unique then, because it was the first case of a man on trial
</p>
<p>before a civil court for the murder of the civil head of the nation,
</p>
<p>the President of the United States, and although since that time
</p>
<p>another has been tried, convicted, and executed, for the murder of
</p>
<p>a President, the case "of Surratt is still unique in this, that his crime
</p>
<p>was overshadowed by a higher crime out of which it grew the
</p>
<p>crime of treason of being engaged in a treasonable conspiracy
</p>
<p>to overthrow his government, and yet the circumstances surround-
</p>
<p>ing the case were such that this could not be alleged in the indict-

</p>
<p>ment, but were of such a nature that this phase of his crime could
</p>
<p>not be excluded from view.
</p>
<p>On the day appointed for the trial of John H. Surratt a very
</p>
<p>large number of people asssembled, and all were deeply interested
</p>
<p>234
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>in his case. The court house was crowded, and it was remarked by
</p>
<p>a most intelligent observer that the appearance and spirit of the
</p>
<p>crowd wore more of the air of a political convention than that of
</p>
<p>men assembled to participate in, and witness, the solemn scene of a
</p>
<p>fellow-being on trial for his life.
</p>
<p>The trial was before Judge Fisher of the Criminal Court of the
</p>
<p>county of Washington, and District of Columbia, a man of great
</p>
<p>legal ability, sterling patriotism, and high moral character. The
</p>
<p>trial was a very lengthy one, and was hotly contested at every point
</p>
<p>by counsel for and against the prisoner. He was defended by lawyers
</p>
<p>who had made an enviable local reputation for ability in their pro-
</p>
<p>fession. The District Attorney and his assistant were aided in the
</p>
<p>prosecution by that pure patriot and eminent jurist, Judge Edwards
</p>
<p>Pierrepont, of New York, who had been retained for that purpose
</p>
<p>by Attorney General Stanbury and William H. Seward, Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, and also by A. G. Riddle, Esq.
</p>
<p>A deep partisan spirit was manifested by the defense from the
</p>
<p>first opening of their mouths to the close of the case. Every effort
</p>
<p>was made to drive the presiding judge from his fearless duty, but
</p>
<p>without avail. He stood firm as the adamantine rock. He was
</p>
<p>not only well qualified by his knowledge of law for his high position,
</p>
<p>but was also impartial, honest, and brave in his decisions on the
</p>
<p>very numerous questions of law and evidence that were raised by
</p>
<p>counsel during the trial. His carriage during that most notable
</p>
<p>trial must command the admiration of both friend and foe ;
</p>
<p>and his decisions will ever command the respect of courts and
</p>
<p>lawyers.
</p>
<p>The loth day of June, 1867, was the day that had been set for
</p>
<p>calling up this case. The United States was represented by the
</p>
<p>District Attorney, E. C. Carrington, Esq., his assistant, Nathaniel
</p>
<p>Wilson, Esq., and associate counsel, Messrs. Edwards Pierrepont and
</p>
<p>A. G. Riddle. The prisoner was represented by Messrs. Joseph H.

</p>
<p>Bradley, R. T. Merrick, and Joseph H. Bradley, Jr. At the earnest
</p>
<p>solicitation of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, and
</p>
<p>upon their representation that the trial would not last more than a
</p>
<p>week, Judge Pierrepont had consented to assist in the prosecution.
</p>
<p>He had just taken his seat in the convention which had met at
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 235
</p>
<p>Albany to make a new constitution for the state of New York and
</p>
<p>in which he had been appointed on the judiciary committee, and
</p>
<p>left his place there to take a part in this trial. He was a Demo-
</p>
<p>crat in politics, but loyal to the government in its struggle for the
</p>
<p>perpetuation of its life. He had filled a judicial position in his own
</p>
<p>State, was a man of great legal acumen, and was noted for his
</p>
<p>patriotism and purity of character.
</p>
<p>At ten o'clock on the roth day of June, 1867, the Court said:
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, this is the day assigned for the trial of John H.
</p>
<p>Surratt, indicted for the murder of Abraham Lincoln, late President
</p>
<p>of the United States. Are you ready to proceed?" To this Mr.
</p>
<p>Bradley responded, " The prisoner is ready, Sir, and has been from
</p>
<p>the first" In this answer we have sounded forth the key-note to
</p>
<p>the spirit and policy of the defense. That candor and honesty of
</p>
<p>purpose which always characterize a judicial frame of mind, would
</p>
<p>have found their sufficient expression in the first clause of this
</p>
<p>reply. The addition of the declaratory clause, "And has been
</p>
<p>from the first" was not mere surplusage, but had in it the distinct
</p>
<p>and manifest intent of boldly assuming in advance, and in the face
</p>
<p>of all the adverse facts, the entire innocence of the prisoner. The
</p>
<p>purpose was at this first moment of opportunity to present the
</p>
<p>prisoner to the jury and to the country as one who was only
</p>
<p>anxious for an opportunity to exculpate himself from all guilt.
</p>
<p>The reader, if he chance to be of an imaginative turn of mind, will
</p>
<p>be able when he reads this clause of the reply of the learned counsel
</p>
<p>to see the assumed air of assurance and self-importance, and to
</p>
<p>hear the arrogant and confident tone of voice with which it was
</p>
<p>uttered. But without thus giving license to our imagination, the
</p>
<p>addition of that clause to Mr. Bradley's reply, when contrasted with
</p>
<p>the efforts of the prisoner to escape and evade a trial, creates an
</p>
<p>impression of a sinister design that is calculated to throw a taint
</p>
<p>of suspicion over all which is to follow in the line of the defense.
</p>
<p>We shall have abundant occasion, as we proceed with the review of

<p>this trial, to show that the suspicion which has been thus created is
</p>
<p>fully justified.
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt, as was shown by the evidence on the trial, was
</p>
<p>in Washington on the I4th day of April, 1865, performing his part
</p>
<p>236 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>in the great crime. He was there aiding and abetting Booth, and
</p>
<p>co-ordinating the agencies employed in the execution of the plot,
</p>
<p>in order that all of the assassinations embraced in it might be simul-
</p>
<p>taneously accomplished. Acting first as a counsellor and then as
</p>
<p>monitor, passing rapidly up and down the street to keep himself in
</p>
<p>communication with the fiends who were to do the work ; calling
</p>
<p>the time loud enough to be heard at some distance ; then going up
</p>
<p>the street to ascertain whether his warning could be heard by Payne,
</p>
<p>and the last time with a face deadly pale and manifesting a degree
</p>
<p>of nervous excitement, inseparable from the commission of such a
</p>
<p>crime, he called the fatal hour, "Ten minutes past ten !" and van-
</p>
<p>ished from sight. He has gone, but he has left an image imprinted
</p>
<p>on the mind and memory of Sergeant Dye that can never be effaced.
</p>
<p>He now becomes a fugitive in disguise, and hies away to Canada to
</p>
<p>join the hellish clan that first conceived and then led him into his
</p>
<p>crime. Here he was at once taken in charge by sympathising friends,
</p>
<p>who kept him hidden away for five months and then, under a
</p>
<p>disguise and an alias, sent him across the Atlantic, and finally to
</p>
<p>Italy.
</p>
<p>Here he is found in the Pope's army, and being charged with his
</p>
<p>crime, which he has already confessed in words as well as by flight,
</p>
<p>is arrested, escapes from his guards, flies to Naples and thence to
</p>
<p>Egypt, is met and arrested at Alexandria, and brought back to the
</p>
<p>scene of his crime, and is now put upon his trial. When asked if
</p>
<p>he is ready, he replies through his counsel, " I am ready, and have
</p>
<p>been from the first." Why, then, did he leave the city of his home,
</p>
<p>his mother and sister and all of his youthful associations, in the
</p>
<p>early morning of the I5th of April, 1865 ? Why did he fly to
</p>
<p>Canada disguised as an English tourist? Why did he hide in
</p>
<p>Canada for almost half a year, and then, in disguise, and under an
</p>
<p>alias, flee to Europe? Why did he escape from his guards in Italy
</p>
<p>at the risk (?) of his life, and flee to Egypt? Why, if innocent,
</p>
<p>did he flee to the ends of the earth, and never cease his flight

</p>
<p>until his way was hedged before him and further flight was impos-
</p>
<p>sible? Was it because he was innocent and desired an opportunity
</p>
<p>to prove his innocence to the world? In the presence of all these
</p>
<p>facts, what a mistake it was to say, "And has been from the first."

<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 237
</p>
<p>In how much better taste it would have been to have simply replied,
</p>
<p>"The prisoner is ready, your honor."
</p>
<p>The District Attorney replied as follows : " If your honor please,
</p>
<p>I am happy to be able to announce that the government is ready
</p>
<p>to proceed with the trial. Before we proceed, however, sir, to
</p>
<p>impannel a jury, we desire to submit a motion to the court, which
</p>
<p>motion we have reduced to writing. With the permission of the
</p>
<p>court I will now proceed to read it to your honor. It is as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
</p>
<p>UNITED STATES AGAINST JOHN H. SURRATT.
</p>
<p>Indictment, Murder.
</p>
<p>" And now, at this day, to wit, on the loth day of June, A.D. 1867, come the United
</p>
<p>States and the said John H. Surratt, by their respective attorneys; and the jurors of
</p>
<p>the jury impanelled and summoned also come; and hereupon the said United States,
</p>
<p>by their attorney, challenge the array of the said panel, because he saith that the said
</p>
<p>jurors comprising said panel were not drawn according to law, and that the names from
</p>
<p>which said jurors were drawn were not selected according to law', wherefore he prays
</p>
<p>judgment, and that the said panel may be quashed." This motion, if your honor please,
</p>
<p>is sustained by an affidavit which I hold in my hand, and which, with the permission of
</p>
<p>your honor, I will now proceed to read. We think after this affidavit shall have been
</p>
<p>read it will be found unnecessary to introduce any oral testimony."
</p>
<p>The motion to quash this panel, it will be observed, rests on two
</p>
<p>allegations : first, that the names were not drawn according to
</p>
<p>law; and, second, that the names from which the jury had been
</p>
<p>drawn were not selected according to law. These allegations were
</p>
<p>fully sustained by the affidavit of Samuel E. Douglas, register of
</p>
<p>Washington City, which was presented and read by the District
</p>
<p>Attorney, and more fully afterwards, upon his oral examination.
</p>
<p>The law governing the question was found in an act of Congress
</p>
<p>of June i6th, 1862, entitled, "An act providing for the selection
</p>
<p>of jurors to serve in the several courts of the District of
</p>
<p>Columbia."

<p>Under the provisions of this act the register of the city of
</p>
<p>Washington, the clerk of the city of Georgetown, and the clerk
</p>
<p>of the levy court of the county of Washington, District of Colum-
</p>
<p>238 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>bia, was each required to make out a list of names of persons
</p>
<p>deemed by him to be most suitable for the duty of jurors, hav-
</p>
<p>ing respect to the exemptions and qualifications specified in the
</p>
<p>act.
</p>
<p>The law required that such lists should be made out annually
</p>
<p>on, or before, the first day of February. The register of the city
</p>
<p>of Washington was to make out a list of names from which four
</p>
<p>hundred should be selected : the clerk of the city of Georgetown
</p>
<p>was to make out a list of names from which eighty were to be
</p>
<p>selected ; and the clerk of the levy court of the county of Wash-
</p>
<p>ington was to make out a list from which forty were to be selected,
</p>
<p>and that such lists should be preserved, and any names that had
</p>
<p>not been drawn for service during the year might be transferred to
</p>
<p>the list made up for the subsequent year.
</p>
<p>Having thus made out their respective lists, these officers were
</p>
<p>required to meet together and jointly select from their respective
</p>
<p>lists the number specified for each one. The names thus selected
</p>
<p>were then to be written on separate and similar pieces of paper,
</p>
<p>folded, or rolled up, so that the name could not be seen ; and
</p>
<p>then deposited in a box provided for the purpose. The box was
</p>
<p>required to be thoroughly shaken and sealed, and was then by
</p>
<p>these three officers to be delivered into the custody of the clerk
</p>
<p>of the court of Washington County for safe keeping. These offi-
</p>
<p>cers were required to meet at the City Hall, in Washington City,
</p>
<p>at least ten days before the commencement of each term of the
</p>
<p>circuit court or of the criminal court, and there the clerk of the
</p>
<p>circuit court was to publicly, and in their presence, break the seal
</p>
<p>of the box and proceed to draw out the number of names required ;
</p>
<p>and if it was a grand jury court, the first twenty-three names drawn
</p>
<p>were to constitute the grand jury, and the next twenty-six names
</p>
<p>drawn were to constitute the petit jury for that term. The jury
</p>
<p>or juries required, having been drawn, the box was again to be
</p>
<p>sealed and delivered to the clerk of the circuit court.

</p>
<p>The affidavit of Samuel E. Douglas, register of the city of
</p>
<p>Washington, was offered with the motion to sustain its allega-
</p>
<p>tions. This affidavit was supplemented by the oral examination
</p>
<p>of Mr. Douglas, under oath. The affidavit and oral examination
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 239
</p>
<p>developed the facts that no such lists had been made out and pre-
</p>
<p>served as required ; also that there had been no joint action of
</p>
<p>these three officers in the selection of names, but that each one
</p>
<p>had written his respective number of names and deposited them
</p>
<p>in the box, without exhibiting them to the other two. There had
</p>
<p>been no joint selection as the law required.
</p>
<p>Still further, the fact was developed that these offices had not
</p>
<p>sealed the box as required, but had delivered it to the clerk of the
</p>
<p>circuit court to be sealed by him. It was further shown that the
</p>
<p>names had been drawn, not by the clerk of the circuit court, but
</p>
<p>by the clerk of the city of Georgetown.
</p>
<p>It will be seen at a glance that the affidavit and oral examina-
</p>
<p>tion of Mr. Douglass fully sustained the allegations of the motion
</p>
<p>of the District Attorney, and that the utter disregard of all the
</p>
<p>most essential requirements of the law could have easily been
</p>
<p>made to subserve a corrupt purpose. Without charging fraud in
</p>
<p>the case, we can easily see how the clerk of the city of George-
</p>
<p>town, who drew this jury, and who had no right to put his hand
</p>
<p>in the box, could have carried in his own hand names of his own
</p>
<p>selection for that special purpose, and from this store to have drawn
</p>
<p>a jury without taking a single name from the box.
</p>
<p>The substance of the affidavit and oral examination of Mr,
</p>
<p>Douglass having been incorporated with the motion of the Dis-
</p>
<p>trict Attorney, the defense made the following replication :
</p>
<p>UNITED STATES \
</p>
<p>vs. > In the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia, No. .
</p>
<p>JOHN H. SURRATT. J
</p>
<p>And thereupon, the defendant saith the said motion is bad in law and in substance.
</p>
<p>The facts stated do not constitute any ground in law for a challenge of the array.
</p>
<p>BRADLEY & MERRICK./OT- defense.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierreponl. We join in the demurrer.
</p>
<p>The question now before the court was simply one of law and
</p>
<p>of fact, and whether the facts in the case, admitted by all, consti-

</p>
<p>tuted such a violation of the law as justified and required the set-
</p>
<p>ting aside of the array. It would seem that it ought to have been
</p>
<p>easily settled, and the fact the motion was hotly contested by the
</p>
<p>defense through a discussion of three days continuance, would
</p>
<p>240 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>seem to indicate that for some reason they had a special desire to
</p>
<p>have their case tried by that particular jury. The argument was
</p>
<p>opened by Mr. Merrick for the defense. His argument was first
</p>
<p>addressed to the construction of the statute, and to the contention
</p>
<p>that the facts alleged and admitted did not constitute such a viola-
</p>
<p>tion of the law as would justify the setting aside of the array.
</p>
<p>And then as there was no statute in regard to the quashing of the
</p>
<p>panel the question was argued on the principles of the common
</p>
<p>law, and many decisions were invoked, both in England and in this
</p>
<p>country, to show that the failure of the officers to comply with the
</p>
<p>law was not such as would vitiate what they did.
</p>
<p>The question was ably discussed on both sides, and ingeniously
</p>
<p>on the part of the defense, which did not confine itself to the
</p>
<p>legal discussion of the question, but made it the occasion for mani-
</p>
<p>festing its spirit and attitude toward the government by insinua-
</p>
<p>tions and innuendo. Thus, Mr. Merrick said, " I hope the United
</p>
<p>States is looking for the attainment of justice in this case ; I trust
</p>
<p>nothing may be developed in this case looking towards anything
</p>
<p>else. I trust the government will tread the high and honorable
</p>
<p>path which leads to the attainment of simple and, I may add,
</p>
<p>speedy justice. And entertaining this hope, I suggest to your
</p>
<p>honor, whether it is probable a jury, against whose qualification
</p>
<p>nothing is alleged, who were summoned without regard to this
</p>
<p>case, and before it was anticipated it might be tried, are not better
</p>
<p>fitted to do justice then another summoned in anticipation of the
</p>
<p>case, a case not of an ordinary private nature, but one of great
</p>
<p>public interest, in which, while the United States as a government,
</p>
<p>I trust, will tread in the highways I have spoken of, there are indi-
</p>
<p>viduals occupying offices in the government who may be disposed
</p>
<p>to tread lower paths which we will have to follow.
</p>
<p>" May it please your honor, I shall say no more upon this motion
</p>
<p>than to add that after the most careful examination I have been
</p>
<p>able to give to it, the honest conclusion to which I have come is,

</p>
<p>that the ground, probably, upon which the motion rests, is to be
</p>
<p>found in the act of 1853, page 160, 10 Statutes at Large, which
</p>
<p>act provides that where a criminal case is on trial in this court and
</p>
<p>a jury has been impanelled, and another term begins during the
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 24!
</p>
<p>progress of the trial, the cause shall continue ; but leaves it exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly questionable whether unless the jury is fully impanelled
</p>
<p>before the end of the term, the cause can be tried. That other
</p>
<p>term begins Monday next, and unless a jury in this case is im-
</p>
<p>panelled before Saturday night it is questionable whether this case
</p>
<p>will be tried for many days or many years."
</p>
<p>To this sly insinuation that the government felt that it had an
</p>
<p>elephant on its hands, and that the motion was a dilatory one thus
</p>
<p>made so early in the case to influence both the jury and public
</p>
<p>opinion, Judge Pierrepont replied as follows: "They will discover
</p>
<p>before we proceed much further, that the United States are as
</p>
<p>zealous, as earnest, and as eager to try this cause as the other
</p>
<p>side, and they will discover before it is through that the public
</p>
<p>mind will be set right with regard to a great many subjects about
</p>
<p>which there have been active, numerous, and unfounded reports.
</p>
<p>Since I have been here in this city for these past few days, it has
</p>
<p>been circulated in nearly all the journals of this country that the
</p>
<p>United States dared not bring forward the diary found upon the
</p>
<p>murderer of the President, because that diary would prove things
</p>
<p>they did not want to have known. All these things will be proved
</p>
<p>to be false, and all the papers, about the suppression of which so
</p>
<p>much has been said, will be exhibited here on the trial of this case.
</p>
<p>We are anxious that it should be proceeded with at once. It has
</p>
<p>likewise been circulated through all the puhflic journals that after
</p>
<p>the former convictions, when an effort was made to go to the
</p>
<p>President for pardon, men active here at the seat of government
</p>
<p>prevented any attempt being made, or the President even being
</p>
<p>reached for the purpose of seeing whether he would not exercise
</p>
<p>clemency ; whereas, the truth, and the truth of record, which will
</p>
<p>be presented in this court, is that all this matter was brought
</p>
<p>before the President and presented to a full cabinet meeting,
</p>
<p>where it was thoroughly discussed ; and after such discussion,
</p>
<p>condemnation, and execution, received not only the sanction of
</p>

</p>
<p>the President, but that of every member of his cabinet. This, and
</p>
<p>a thousand other of these false stories, will be all set at rest for-
</p>
<p>ever in the progress of this trial ; and the gentlemen may feel
</p>
<p>assured that not only are we ready but that we are desirous of
</p>
<p>242 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>proceeding at once with the case." The insinuation of Mr. Mer-
</p>
<p>rick, having been thus bravely and fully met, the defense felt it
</p>
<p>necessary to shift its ground, and so Mr. Bradley, in the course of
</p>
<p>his argument, found another reason for the motion of the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion to quash the panel, which he artfully put forth in the form of
</p>
<p>an insinuation as follows : " I think I can see where this thing is
</p>
<p>drifting. It is not delay that is sought, but they have another motive
</p>
<p>more powerful than delay. It is to get another jury in the place of
</p>
<p>this honest jury already summoned. Why, sir, the gentleman talks
</p>
<p>about the misgivings in the public prints. I do not know that he
</p>
<p>has seen what I hold in my hand, an article from this place
</p>
<p>denouncing this jury because sixteen of them are Catholics, as
</p>
<p>they say, but there it is such an article has been written and
</p>
<p>published in the New York Herald. I know, too, that the same
</p>
<p>article, published yesterday morning, foreshadows the fact that
</p>
<p>these gentlemen were to come into court on the day they did, and
</p>
<p>make the identical motion that they have submitted here."
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick. "And states the ground of the motion?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley. "Yes Sir, states the ground of the motion. It
</p>
<p>looks to me as though it came from very near home."
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierrepont. "What does it state as the ground of the
</p>
<p>motion? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley. "There it is, just the same ground precisely as
</p>
<p>was stated here that it was not a lawful panel."
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierrepont. "Oh!" (laughingly.)
</p>
<p>Thus we get a glimpse at the outside pressure that was brought
</p>
<p>to bear on this trial by a constant fusilade of falsehoods couched in
</p>
<p>cunningly-devised paragraphs that they might gain a general circu-
</p>
<p>lation through the press of the country for the purpose not only of
</p>
<p>influencing the jury in this case, but also of misleading and pervert-
</p>
<p>ing public opinion.
</p>
<p>The fact brought out in this paragraph is somewhat remarkable.
</p>
<p>It might have been a mere chance that sixteen out of the twenty-

</p>
<p>six drawn for the jury happened to be Catholics, but we cannot
</p>
<p>help feeling a suspicion that had the law been a little more closely
</p>
<p>followed it might have been otherwise.
</p>
<p>To the insinuation of Mr. Bradley, the District Attorney replied
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 243
</p>
<p>as follows : "I do not rise for the purpose of arguing the motion
</p>
<p>before the court, but with the permission of your honor, and my
</p>
<p>learned friend, simply to say a word or two in regard to a certain
</p>
<p>statement in one of the newspapers of the day to which my atten-
</p>
<p>tion has just been called. It is an item in the New York Herald,
</p>
<p>purporting to be telegraphed from this city.
</p>
<p>The article is not very complimentary to myself, but as my friend
</p>
<p>is spoken of in very high terms, I am not disposed to quarrel with
</p>
<p>the writer, for, as a generous-hearted man, I am more anxious for
</p>
<p>the reputation of my friend than I am for my own. What is inti-
</p>
<p>mated in it, I would not think of sufficient importance to be called
</p>
<p>to the attention of the court, were it not that allusion has been
</p>
<p>made to it here by the learned counsel who last addressed your
</p>
<p>honor.
</p>
<p>He stated that there was some reason not made known for this
</p>
<p>motion which we have submitted. I deem it due to myself to
</p>
<p>say
</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley. "I beg your pardon if I have said anything
</p>
<p>wrong. I thought it was a fair retort on what was said by Judge
</p>
<p>Pierrepont."
</p>
<p>The District Attorney. "Notwithstanding the disclaimer of the
</p>
<p>gentleman to impute any wrong motive to us in submitting the
</p>
<p>motion now before your honor, I think, inasmuch as public refer-
</p>
<p>ence has been made to it here, it is due to my position before the
</p>
<p>country to say a word. I will here say, then, that there is no one
</p>
<p>who would more earnestly and sincerely deprecate any appeal to
</p>
<p>religious prejudices than myself. Politicians may speak, think, and
</p>
<p>act as they please, but for my part I would drive from the halls of
</p>
<p>justice the demon of party spirit and religious fanaticism. I trust
</p>
<p>in God the day will never come when a judge, or a jury, will be
</p>
<p>influenced in the discharge of the most solemn duty that can
</p>
<p>possibly be devolved upon human beings by political or religious
</p>
<p>considerations."

</p>
<p>At the assembling of the court on the morning of the I3th,
</p>
<p>Judge Fisher delivered an exhaustive opinion on the motion before
</p>
<p>him. As it is somewhat lengthy I shall only give its concluding
</p>
<p>paragraph. "Believing, therefore, that the substantial require-
</p>
<p>244 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>ments of the act of Congress in this case providing for the
</p>
<p>selection of a fair and impartial jury, have not been complied with,
</p>
<p>but entirely set at naught, and that there has been grave default on
</p>
<p>the part of the officers whom that act has substituted in the place of
</p>
<p>the marshal, for the purpose of having them exercise a united
</p>
<p>judgment in the selection of all the persons whose names are to go
</p>
<p>in the jury box, I am constrained to allow the motion of challenge
</p>
<p>in this case. I do not consider the fact that the present panel
</p>
<p>were improperly drawn by the clerk of Georgetown, who had no
</p>
<p>right to put his hand into the box, because the objection which I
</p>
<p>have allowed lies even deeper than that. It is, therefore, ordered
</p>
<p>by the Court that the present panel be set aside, and that the
</p>
<p>Marshal of the District of Columbia do now proceed to summon a
</p>
<p>jury of talesmen."
</p>
<p>Judge Fisher subsequently said : " My order is that the Marshal
</p>
<p>summon twenty-six talesmen." The process of securing a jury
</p>
<p>from talesmen occupied the next four days, and about two hundred
</p>
<p>talesmen were summoned before a panel could be secured.
</p>
<p>Many of those summoned by the marshal were excused on
</p>
<p>showing sufficient grounds ; a very large number were found
</p>
<p>disqualified on their voire dire; and perhaps all of the challenges,
</p>
<p>or nearly so, to which the parties were entitled, were exhausted,
</p>
<p>and it was not until the evening session of the i6th of June, that
</p>
<p>the jury was impaneled to try the case.
</p>
<p>When a panel of twenty-six jurors had been secured, counsel
</p>
<p>for the prisoner, through Mr. Merrick, said : " If your honor please,
</p>
<p>we are now ready to proceed to empanel the jury. Before doing
</p>
<p>so, however, we think it our duty, in behalf of the prisoner, to
</p>
<p>file our challenge to the present array. Your honor has virtu-
</p>
<p>ally decided the question, and we do not desire to take up any
</p>
<p>time in its argument. We simply wish that it may be filed so that
</p>
<p>it can be passed upon."

<p>The challenge in word and form is as follows :
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 245
</p>
<p>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES vs. JOHN H. SURRATT.
</p>
<p>In the Criminal Court, March Term, 1867.
</p>
<p>And the said Marshal of the District of Columbia, in obedience to the order of the
</p>
<p>Court, made in this case on the I2th of June instant, this day makes return that he
</p>
<p>hath summoned, and now hath in court here twenty-six jurors, talesman, as a panel
</p>
<p>from which to form a jury to try the said cause, and the names of the twenty-six jurors
</p>
<p>so returned being called by the clerk of said court, and they having answered to their
</p>
<p>names as they were called, the said John H. Surratt, by his attorneys, doth challenge
</p>
<p>the array of the said panel, because he saith it doth plainly appear by the records and
</p>
<p>proceedings of the Court in this cause that no jurors have ever been summoned accord-
</p>
<p>ing to law to serve during the present term of this Court, and no names of jurors, duly
</p>
<p>and lawfully summoned, have been placed in the box provided for in the fourth section
</p>
<p>of the act of Congress, entitled, "An Act providing for the Selection of Jurors to serve
</p>
<p>in the Several Courts of the District," approved i6th of June, 1862, on or before the
</p>
<p>ist day of February, 1867, to serve for the ensuing year, wherefore he prays judgment
</p>
<p>that the panel now returned by the said Marshal, and now in court here, be quashed.
</p>
<p>MERRICK, BRADLEY & BRADLEY,
</p>
<p>Attorneys for Surratt.
</p>
<p>This motion was made as a foundation for carrying the case up
</p>
<p>on a writ of error in the event of the conviction of the prisoner.
</p>
<p>On Monday, the i8th of June, the case was opened by Mr.
</p>
<p>Nathaniel Wilson, Assistant District Attorney, as follows : " May it
</p>
<p>please your honor and gentlemen of the jury, you are doubtless
</p>
<p>aware that it is customary in criminal cases for the prosecution at
</p>
<p>the beginning of a trial to inform the jury of the nature of the
</p>
<p>offense to be inquired into, and of the proof that will be offered in
</p>
<p>support of the charges of the indictment. By making such a state-
</p>
<p>ment I hope to aid you in clearly ascertaining the work that is
</p>
<p>before us, and in apprehending the relevancy and significance of
</p>
<p>the testimony that will be produced as the case proceeds.
</p>
<p>" The grand jury of the District of Columbia have indicted the
</p>
<p>prisoner at the bar, John H. Surratt, as one of the murderers of

<p>Abraham Lincoln. It has become your duty to judge whether he
</p>
<p>be guilty or innocent of that charge, a duty than which one
</p>
<p>more solemn or momentous never was committed to human intel-
</p>
<p>ligence. You are to turn back the leaves of history to that red
</p>
<p>page on which is recorded in letters of blood the awful incidents of
</p>
<p>that April night on which the assassin's work was done on the body
</p>
<p>246 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>of the Chief Magistrate of the American republic, a night on
</p>
<p>which for the first time in our existence as a nation, a blow was
</p>
<p>struck with the fell purpose not only of destroying human life, but
</p>
<p>the life of the nation, the life of liberty itself. Though more than
</p>
<p>two years have passed by since then, you scarcely need witnesses
</p>
<p>to describe to you the scene in Ford's Theatre as it was visible in
</p>
<p>the last hour of the President's conscious life. It has been present
</p>
<p>to your thoughts a thousand times since then. A vast audience
</p>
<p>were assembled, whose hearts were throbbing with a new joy, born
</p>
<p>of victory and peace, and above them the object of their gratitude
</p>
<p>and reverence, he who had borne the nation's burdens through
</p>
<p>many and disastrous years, sat tranquil and at rest at last, a
</p>
<p>victor indeed, but a victor in whose generous heart triumph
</p>
<p>awakened no emotions save those of kindliness, of forgiveness, and
</p>
<p>of charity. To him, in that hour of supreme tranquility, to him in
</p>
<p>the charmed circle of friendship and affection, there came the form
</p>
<p>of sudden and terrible death.
</p>
<p>" Persons who were then present will tell you that at about twenty
</p>
<p>minutes past ten o'clock that night, the night of the I4th of April,
</p>
<p>1865, John Wilkes Booth, armed with pistol and knife, passed
</p>
<p>rapidly from the front door of the theatre, ascended to the dress
</p>
<p>circle, and entered the President's box. By the discharge of a
</p>
<p>pistol he inflicted a death wound, then leaped upon the stage, and
</p>
<p>passing rapidly across it, disappeared into the darkness of the
</p>
<p>night.
</p>
<p>" We shall prove to your entire satisfaction, by competent and
</p>
<p>credible witnesses, that at that time the prisoner at the bar was
</p>
<p>then present, aiding and abetting that murder; and that at ten
</p>
<p>minutes past ten o'clock that night he was in front of that theatre
</p>
<p>in company with Booth. You shall hear what he then said and
</p>
<p>did. You shall know that his cool and calculating malice was the
</p>
<p>director of the bullet that pierced the brain of the President and the
</p>
<p>knife that fell upon the venerable Secretary of State. You shall

</p>
<p>know that the prisoner at the bar was the contriver of that villainy,
</p>
<p>and that from the presence of the prisoner, Booth, drunk with
</p>
<p>theatric passion and traitorous hate, rushed directly to the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of their mutual will. We shall further prove to you that
</p>
<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 247
</p>
<p>their companionship upon that occasion was not an accidental
</p>
<p>or unexpected one, but that the butchery that ensued was the
</p>
<p>ripe result of a long premeditated plot, in which the prisoner
</p>
<p>was the chief conspirator. It will be proved to you that he is
</p>
<p>a traitor to the government that protected him ; a spy in the
</p>
<p>employ of the enemies of his country in the years 1864 and 1865 ;
</p>
<p>passed repeatedly from Richmond to Washington, from Wash-
</p>
<p>ington to Canada, weaving the web of his nefarious scheme, plot-
</p>
<p>ting the overthrow of this government, the defeat of its armies,
</p>
<p>and the slaughter of his countrymen ; and as showing the venom
</p>
<p>of his intent, as showing a mind insensible to every moral obli-
</p>
<p>gation and fatally bent on mischief, we shall prove his gleeful
</p>
<p>boasts that during these journeys he had shot down in cold
</p>
<p>blood, weak and unarmed Union soldiers, fleeing from rebel prisons.
</p>
<p>It will be proved to you that he made his home in this city the
</p>
<p>rendezvous for the tools and agents in what he called his " bloody
</p>
<p>work," and that his hand deposited at Surrattsville, in a con-
</p>
<p>venient place, the very weapons obtained by Booth while escap-
</p>
<p>ing, one of which fell or was wrenched from Booth's death grip,
</p>
<p>at the moment of his capture.
</p>
<p>"While in Montreal, Canada, where he had gone from Richmond,
</p>
<p>on the roth of April, on the Monday before the assassination,
</p>
<p>Surratt received a summons from his co-conspirator, Booth, requir-
</p>
<p>ing his immediate presence in this city. In obedience to that pre-
</p>
<p>concerted signal, he at once left Canada, and arrived here on the
</p>
<p>1 4th. By numerous, I had almost said a multitude, of witnesses,
</p>
<p>we shall make the proof to be as clear as the noonday sun, and as
</p>
<p>convincing as the axioms of truth, that he was here during the
</p>
<p>day of that fatal Friday, as well as present at the theatre at night,
</p>
<p>as I have before stated. We shall show him to you on Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania Avenue, booted and spurred, awaiting the arrival of the fatal
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p>"We shall show him in conference with Herold in the evening;

</p>
<p>we shall show him purchasing a contrivance for disguise an hour
</p>
<p>or two before the murder.
</p>
<p>" When the last blew had been struck, when he had done his
</p>
<p>utmost to bring anarchy and desolation upon his native land, he
</p>
<p>248 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>turned his back upon the abomination he had wrought, he turned
</p>
<p>his back upon his home and kindred, and commenced his shud-
</p>
<p>dering flight.
</p>
<p>"We shall trace that flight, because in law flight is the criminal's
</p>
<p>inarticulate confession, and because it happened in this case as it
</p>
<p>always happens, and always must happen, that in some moment
</p>
<p>of fear or of elation, or of fancied security, he, too, to others,
</p>
<p>confessed his guilty deeds. He fled to Canada. We will prove
</p>
<p>to you the hour of his arrival there and the route he took. He
</p>
<p>there found safe concealment, and remained there several months,
</p>
<p>voluntarily absenting himself from his mother. In the following
</p>
<p>September he took his flight. Still in disguise, with painted face,
</p>
<p>and painted hair, and painted hand, he took ship to cross the At-
</p>
<p>lantic. In mid-ocean he revealed himself and related his exploits,
</p>
<p>and spoke freely of his connection with Booth in the conspiracy
</p>
<p>relating to the President. He rejoiced in the death of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, he lifted his impious hand to heaven and expressed the wish
</p>
<p>that he might live to return to America and serve Andrew Johnson
</p>
<p>as Abraham Lincoln had been served. He was hidden for a time
</p>
<p>in England, and found there [sympathy and hospitality ; but soon
</p>
<p>was made again an outcast and a wanderer by his guilty secret.
</p>
<p>From England he went to Rome, and hid himself in the ranks of
</p>
<p>the Papal army in the guise of a private soldier. Having placed
</p>
<p>almost the diameter of the globe between himself and the dead
</p>
<p>body of his victim, he might well fancy that pursuit was baffled,
</p>
<p>but by the happening of one of those events which we sometimes
</p>
<p>call accidents, but which are indeed the mysterious means by which
</p>
<p>Omnicient and Omnipotent justice reveals and punishes the doers
</p>
<p>of evil, he was discovered by an acquaintance of his boyhood.
</p>
<p>When denial would not avail he admitted his identity, and avowed
</p>
<p>his guilt in these memorable words : 'I have done the Yankees as
</p>
<p>much harm as I could. We have killed Lincoln, the nigger's
</p>
<p>friend.'

<p>"The man to whom Surratt made this statement, did as it was his
</p>
<p>high duty to do he made known his discovery to the American
</p>
<p>minister. There is no treaty of extradition with the Papal States;
</p>
<p>but so heinous is the crime with which Surratt is charged, such

</p>
<p>bad notoriety had his name obtained, that his Holiness the Pope
</p>
<p>and Cardinal Antonelli ordered his arrest without waiting for a
</p>
<p>formal demand from the American government. Having him
</p>
<p>arrested, he escaped from his guards by a leap down a precipice
</p>
<p>a leap impossible to any but one to whom conscience made life
</p>
<p>valueless. He made his way to Naples, and then took passage in
</p>
<p>a steamer that carried him across the Mediterranean Sea to Alex-
</p>
<p>andria, in Egypt. He was pursued, not by the ' blood hounds of
</p>
<p>the law,' that seem to haunt the imagination of the prisoner's
</p>
<p>counsel [this refers to a remark made by Mr. Merrick when dis-
</p>
<p>cussing the motion to quash the panel] , but by the very elements,
</p>
<p>by destruction itself, made a slave in the service of justice. The
</p>
<p>inexorable lightning thrilled along the wires that stretch through
</p>
<p>the waste of waters that roll between the shores of Italy and the
</p>
<p>shores of Egypt, and spake in his ear its word of terrible command ;
</p>
<p>and from Alexandria, aghast and manacled, he was made to turn
</p>
<p>his face towards the land he had polluted by the curse of murder.
</p>
<p>He is here at last to be tried for his crime.
</p>
<p>And when the facts which I have stated have been proved, as proved
</p>
<p>they assuredly will be, if anything is ever proved by hnman testi-
</p>
<p>mony, and when all the subterfuges of the defense have been
</p>
<p>disproved, as disproved they assuredly will be, we, having done our
</p>
<p>duty in furnishing you with that proof of the prisoner's guilt, in
</p>
<p>the name of the civilization he has dishonored, in the name of the
</p>
<p>country he has betrayed and disgraced, in the name of the law
</p>
<p>he has violated and defied, shall demand of you that retribution,
</p>
<p>though tardily, shall yet surely be done, upon the shedder of
</p>
<p>innocent and precious blood."
</p>
<p>Before the hearing of evidence was entered upon, the prisoner
</p>
<p>presented the following petition to the Court:
</p>
<p>" To the Honorable, the Justices of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, hold-
</p>
<p>ing the Criminal Court in Alarch Term, i86j.
</p>
<p>"The petition of John H. Surratt shows that he has been put upon his trial in a

<p>capital case in this court; that he has exhausted all his means, and such further means
</p>
<p>as have been furnished him by the liberality of his friends, in preparing for his defense,
</p>
<p>and he is now unable to procure the attendance of his witnesses. He therefore prays
</p>
<p>your honor for an order that process may issue to summon his witnesses, and to compel
</p>
<p>their attendance at the cost of the government of the United States, according to the
</p>
<p>statute in such cases made and provided."
</p>
<p>250 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>This petition was signed, sworn to in open court, and attested by
</p>
<p>the clerk according to law, and was granted by the court.
</p>
<p>The government introduced eighty-five witnesses in chief to
</p>
<p>sustain the various counts in the indictment, and ninety-six in re-
</p>
<p>buttal. The defense introduced ninety-eight witnesses to overthrow
</p>
<p>the testimony of the witnesses in chief on the part of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and twenty-three in surrebuttal, making in all three hundred
</p>
<p>and two witnesses that were examined during the trial. The
</p>
<p>examination of these witnesses occupied the period of thirty-nine
</p>
<p>days. The hearing of the evidence commenced on the I /th of
</p>
<p>June, and was concluded on the 26th of July. The arguments in
</p>
<p>the case were concluded on the /th of August, and on that day
</p>
<p>Judge Fisher delivered his charge to the jury and gave them the
</p>
<p>case. On Saturday, the loth day of August, just two months from
</p>
<p>the commencement of the trial, the jury reported that they stood
</p>
<p>about equally divided in favor of conviction and acquittal, and
</p>
<p>that there was no prospect of their being able to agree.
</p>
<p>The Court inquired whether anything was to be said why the
</p>
<p>jury should not now be discharged. Mr. Bradley said: "The pris-
</p>
<p>oner gave no consent to any discharge of the jury. If they were
</p>
<p>to be discharged he wants it understood that it was against his will
</p>
<p>and protest."
</p>
<p>The District Attorney, on behalf of the government, left the
</p>
<p>whole matter with the Court.
</p>
<p>The Court remarked that this was the third communication of a
</p>
<p>similar tenor he had received from the jury. If he thought there
</p>
<p>was any possibility of their coming to an agreement as to the guilt
</p>
<p>or innocence of the prisoner, he would have no objections to keep-
</p>
<p>ing them out longer, but supposing from the statement made by
</p>
<p>them, no such result could be expected, he directed the jury now
</p>
<p>to be discharged. The prisoner was then remanded to the custody
</p>
<p>of the Marshal.
</p>
<p>A second indictment was found against him for the murder of

</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, and the District Attorney entered a nolle pro-
</p>
<p>sequi on this. Thus the prisoner was set at large.
</p>
<p>The result of this trial by a civil court made it clear that no
</p>
<p>verdict could be expected from any jury that could be obtained

<p>INDICTMENT AND TRIAL. 2$ I
</p>
<p>under the law, and so the case was not further prosecuted.
</p>
<p>It does not come within the scope of the author's plan to
</p>
<p>review in detail this great mass of evidence. Neither is it neces-
</p>
<p>sary. It is sufficient for him to say that the charges contained in
</p>
<p>the indictment were fully proven by the testimony in chief of the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the government, and that this testimony was not im-
</p>
<p>paired in any essential point by the efforts of the counsel for the
</p>
<p>defense in their cross-examination of these witnesses, nor yet by
</p>
<p>the testimony offered by the defense. It will be found upon a
</p>
<p>careful and candid scrutiny to fully sustain the statements herein-
</p>
<p>before given as to the conduct of Surratt in his relations to the
</p>
<p>transaction. No one can carefully read the masterly summing up
</p>
<p>of the evidence, and the fair and honest interpretation of it by
</p>
<p>Judge Pierrepont in his concluding argument, without being
</p>
<p>thoroughly convinced that Surratt was a prominent and active
</p>
<p>member of the conspiracy, and that he took an active hand
</p>
<p>through a period of more than three months in preparing for
</p>
<p>the execution of its purposes, as also in its final accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment. The evidence was shown to prove conclusively the fact
</p>
<p>that from the time of his introduction to Booth, on the 23d of
</p>
<p>December, 1864, to the time of the assassination, their associa-
</p>
<p>tions were of the most intimate and confidential character; that
</p>
<p>they were much together, and co-operated in bringing together
</p>
<p>in Washington City the other members of the conspiracy, on
</p>
<p>whom they relied for important parts in the final act. It was
</p>
<p>shown that the house of Mrs. Surratt, the mother of the pris-
</p>
<p>oner, was the place of rendezvous for Booth, Atzerodt, and
</p>
<p>Payne, and that her house at Surrattsville, occupied by her ten-
</p>
<p>ant, Lloyd, was made the place of deposit for arms to be used by
</p>
<p>Booth and Herold in their flight after the murder; that these
</p>
<p>were placed there by Surratt, and that his mother also had knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, not only of this fact, but of the purpose for which they had
</p>
<p>been provided, and of the time they would be called for, and was

</p>
<p>fication to have them ready, as they would be called for that
</p>
<p>night. 1

</p>
<p>which I had from him, with his consent to publish it. AUTHOR.
</p>
<p>252 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>It was here, on this civil trial, that " the scales of justice fell,"
</p>
<p>and not, as alleged by the prisoner's counsel, at the trial before
</p>
<p>the Military Commission.
</p>
<p>The District Attorney and his able assistant, Judge Pierrepont,
</p>
<p>had both expressed their confidence in the ability of the civil
</p>
<p>courts to compass the ends of justice ; but the result of this trial
</p>
<p>showed that in a crime committed to further political party
</p>
<p>interests, no jury could be expected to find a verdict; and so the
</p>
<p>government refused to prosecute the case any further. The
</p>
<p>prisoner was set at large.
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trial, on Aug. loth, 1867, Surratt was
</p>
<p>remanded to prison, and on May I2th, 1868, he asked to be
</p>
<p>released on bail, but was refused. On June 22d, 1868, he was
</p>
<p>released from custody. On the 22d of September, 1868, a nolle
</p>
<p>prosequi was entered.
</p>
<p>Another indictment was found against him for engaging in
</p>
<p>rebellion. Upon this he was ordered to be admitted to bail in a
</p>
<p>bond of $20,000. He first pleaded not guilty, and then asked to
</p>
<p>withdraw this plea, and to file a special plea, which was granted.
</p>
<p>The government demurred to the plea on Sept. 22d, 1869.

<p>The demurrer was overruled, and he was finally discharged.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>A CRITICISM OF THE DEFENSE.
</p>
<p>IT now remains for the writer to review the course of the defense
</p>
<p>in this trial, and to point out its policy, its spirit, its perversion of
</p>
<p>facts, and disregard of evidence in carrying out its purpose to
</p>
<p>appeal, first, to the prejudice of the jury, and then to pervert pub-
</p>
<p>lic opinion.
</p>
<p>The prisoner was defended by counsel of known and acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged ability men of reputation for their knowledge of law, and
</p>
<p>ability as advocates at the bar. But despite all this, their defense
</p>
<p>of Surratt was as unique in its character as was the case itself.
</p>
<p>Made by men learned in the law, it ignored the requirements of
</p>
<p>law, and so was managed by them more in the light of its political
</p>
<p>relations, than that of its legal requirements. In proof of this
</p>
<p>assertion I shall quote freely from the arguments of counsel, and I
</p>
<p>think I shall be able to show that I am fully justified in expressing
</p>
<p>this opinion. I shall first refer to the remarkable number of
</p>
<p>exceptions taken by the counsel for the defense to the rulings of
</p>
<p>the Court on questions of evidence, and the use made of them.
</p>
<p>I will quote first from the argument of Mr. Merrick.

<p>" In a prosecution such as this, conducted against one of its

</p>
<p>voked to exclude that testimony ; has been bent from its uniform
</p>
<p>application and its generally understood principle for that purpose.
</p>
<p>I shall find no fault with his honor on the bench in his rulings,
</p>
<p>o"
</p>
<p>for this is not my place to express an opinion about a decision of
</p>
<p>the Court.
</p>
<p>A member of the bar should be loyal to the tribunal before
</p>
<p>which he practices, to the full extent of gentlemanly and pro-
</p>
<p>fessional courtesy, and in the court-room bow with pleasant
</p>
<p>acquiescence in whatever the judge may say. With that acquies-
</p>
<p>cence I bow, and yet there is nothing and I must say this, and say it
</p>
<p>injustice to myself there is nothing that has fallen from his honor
</p>
<p>in the adjudiciation upon these questions of testimony that has
</p>
<p>changed my opinion that the testimony should be allowed to go to
</p>
<p>the jury. One hundred and fifty exceptions taken by the defend-
</p>
<p>ant's counsel encumber this record. It is certainly strange that
</p>
<p>there should have been so wide a difference, and I regret it.
</p>
<p>Without complaining, as I said, of the decisions of the Court, it can
</p>
<p>only be accounted for from the fact that the attorneys representing
</p>
<p>the government in this case have strained every principle of law,
</p>
<p>and invoked in their behalf every discretionary power of the court,
</p>
<p>as against the prisoner."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his semblance of disclaimer, Mr. Merrick here
</p>
<p>makes an appeal to the jury, on the implied charge of partiality on
</p>
<p>the part of this Court. In giving his charge to the jury Judge
</p>
<p>Fisher very properly takes notice of this charge, and effectually
</p>
<p>rebukes the arrogance of the counsel in the following language:
</p>
<p>"Much stress has been laid by the counsel for the defense
</p>
<p>upon the fact, which they assert, that during the progress of this
</p>
<p>trial more than one hundred and fifty exceptions have been taken
</p>
<p>to the rulings of the court concerning the admissibility of evidence.
</p>
<p>If they have found themselves under the necessity of calculating
</p>
<p>the number of these exceptions, and parading them before you,

</p>
<p>with a view of having you render a verdict according to irrelevant
</p>
<p>evidence not before you, rather than according to the legal evidence
</p>
<p>which you have heard, I have no disposition to criticise their
</p>
<p>taste, but leave them to present their case in their own way. At
</p>
<p>the same time I feel it my duty to remark to you that if counsel
</p>
<p>A CRITICISM OF THE DEFENSE.
</p>
<p>255
</p>
<p>will be so bold as to present propositions to the Court which every
</p>
<p>tyro in the profession ought to know are untenable, it does not
</p>
<p>necessarily follow that the judge must always be so weak as to
</p>
<p>sustain them. It has heretofore been supposed that exceptions to
</p>
<p>the rulings of a judge at nisi prins were intended to be passed in
</p>
<p>review before the appellate tribunal. I have never before known
</p>
<p>them to be neatly calculated and presented to the jury by way of
</p>
<p>argument."
</p>
<p>A jury is sworn to decide according to the law and evidence in
</p>
<p>the case. But how are jurors to decide according to the law, not
</p>
<p>being acquainted with law? It is manifest they cannot take their
</p>
<p>instructions on the law from the counsel employed in the case, as
</p>
<p>they will naturally differ widely in their constructions of law. It
</p>
<p>is made, therefore, the duty of the court, an impartial tribunal,
</p>
<p>skilled in law, to instruct the jury on all the points of law involved
</p>
<p>in the case. In this remarkable case the counsel for the defense,
</p>
<p>feeling that the court could not sustain the interpretations of the
</p>
<p>law on several important points which they had ' endeavored to
</p>
<p>impress on the jury in their arguments, took the remarkable posi-
</p>
<p>tion that the jury was to be its own judge of questions of law.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick, in the course of his argument, took this position,
</p>
<p>and argued it at some length, as follows: "The jury is specially
</p>
<p>charged, it is true, with the fact; but they are also charged
</p>
<p>with the law. You are to instruct them by your learning, your
</p>
<p>wisdom, and by your authority. You are to advise them ; but
</p>
<p>they must know and they must believe. My learned brother on
</p>
<p>the other side (Mr. Carrington) seemed to feel that it was neces-
</p>
<p>sary to press you, gentlemen, very hard upon your obligation to
</p>
<p>follow the instructions of the Court. I have never heard him say
</p>
<p>that before. Other cases have been tried before this, but I have
</p>
<p>never heard him talk so earnestly to the jury about being obliged
</p>
<p>to follow the instructions of the Court. Why is he so solicitous in

</p>
<p>this case? Does he think you won't dare to do right? He told
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen of the jury, that you were sworn to try this case
</p>
<p>according to the law and the fact, and that you must take the law
</p>
<p>from the court; and if you departed from the law so given you,
</p>
<p>you would be perjured. I tell you it is no such thing. If you
</p>
<p>256 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>find a verdict of guilty, and do not believe the party to be guilty
</p>
<p>in every particular, in your judgment and in your hearts, then
</p>
<p>you are perjured men, I care not what the Court's instruction is.
</p>
<p>" Has my learned friend read the oath? I don't think he has.
</p>
<p>Mr. Clerk, will you be kind enough to read it." (The clerk then
</p>
<p>read the oath.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick resuming, said: "Where is the law? Why did
</p>
<p>you tell the jury what you did? The language is, 'And a true
</p>
<p>verdict give according to the evidence.' My learned brother has
</p>
<p>had that oath ringing in his ears for six years. Why didn't he
</p>
<p>tell you what it was? You are, gentlemen, to find a verdict
</p>
<p>according to the evidence. What sort of verdict are you to find ?
</p>
<p>Guilty, or not guilty. That is all you can say. You cannot say
</p>
<p>' Guilty,' under the Court's instruction, or ' Not guilty,' under the
</p>
<p>Court's instruction. If you say ' Guilty,' you say ' Guilty as in-
</p>
<p>dicted,' upon your conscience resting the weight of the guilt. If
</p>
<p>your verdict should be ' Guilty,' it will be followed by blood, for you
</p>
<p>see there is no mercy anywhere in those that represent the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. If your verdict is guilty, then, indeed, you look upon a
</p>
<p>dying man. Upon your consciences will rest the responsibility of
</p>
<p>that verdict.
</p>
<p>"And let me say to you, gentlemen of the jury, that on that awful
</p>
<p>day when you shall stand before the last tribunal to be judged, and
</p>
<p>the All-Seeing Eye shall look into your hearts and ask you why
</p>
<p>you found this verdict of guilty, think you He will harken if you
</p>
<p>say, ' The judge's instructions made me do it.' He will say to you, '
</p>
<p>' Were you not free agents, with minds and intellects, sworn as a
</p>
<p>jury in a free country? Were you not told by the counsel for the
</p>
<p>prisoner at the bar that it was your duty to find this verdict
</p>
<p>according to your judgments, your consciences, and didn't you
</p>
<p>disregard him? '
</p>
<p>" If Judge Fisher's instructions made you find it, bring Judge
</p>
<p>Fisher. Where is the Judge ? Think you he will step forward and

</p>
<p>say, ' I will take the burden.' No, gentlemen. Let me say to
</p>
<p>you now, that by the laws of the land, and by the laws of God, the
</p>
<p>responsibility is on the judge to instruct you rightly, to guide
</p>
<p>you correctly, to give you wise and judicious counsel, not as
</p>
<p>A CRITICISM OF THE DEFENSE. 257
</p>
<p>mandatory and binding on your conscience, but as advisory to
</p>
<p>your judgment, to enlighten the pathway you are to tread in your
</p>
<p>investigations. We shall ask no instructions, and desire none. The
</p>
<p>law of murder is too plain to need any, and you, gentlemen, are
</p>
<p>too intelligent not to understand it. Indeed, if we desire some
</p>
<p>explanation, we would prefer to give it to you in the way of argu-
</p>
<p>ment, rather than trust it to the distinguished judge who presides.
</p>
<p>We would trust it to argument, because, with regard to these plain
</p>
<p>questions, all men can comprehend what the law is. We would
</p>
<p>prefer trusting it to the weight of our own character with the jury
</p>
<p>as men and lawyers." After this ingenious appeal to the jury, the
</p>
<p>learned advocate then proceeded to recount and expound the pro-
</p>
<p>positions of law on which the District Attorney had invoked the
</p>
<p>instructions of the Court.
</p>
<p>Judge Fisher in charging the jury made the following reference
</p>
<p>to this remarkable argument by Mr. Merrick : " You have been
</p>
<p>told, gentlemen, by the counsel for the defense, in a manner not
</p>
<p>very respectful, certainly by no means complimentary to the Court,
</p>
<p>that you are the judges of the law as well as the facts in criminal
</p>
<p>cases, and that you have the right to disregard the instructions of
</p>
<p>the Court in matters of law; and they tell you that their exposi-
</p>
<p>tions of the law, and the weight of character they possess, may be
</p>
<p>more safely relied upon than the instructions which may be given
</p>
<p>you by the Court. The weight of character of a prisoner's coun-
</p>
<p>sel would be a variable, and not unfrequently a very unsafe cri-
</p>
<p>terion by which the jury should judge as to the law of his case.
</p>
<p>Perhaps they would have you regard the court as sitting on the
</p>
<p>bench merely to discharge the duty of preserving order and deco-
</p>
<p>rum in the court room, which probably the crier of the court or
</p>
<p>baliff might be disposed to regard as an usurpation of his preroga-
</p>
<p>tive. If the jury are entirely to disregard the judge's instructions
</p>
<p>as to the law of a case, I confess I can see but little left than that
</p>
<p>for him to perform.

</p>
<p>" It is true, gentlemen, that you have the power, and in cases
</p>
<p>where your consciences are satisfied that the instructions of the
</p>
<p>Court are dictated, not by an honest desire to enlighten the jury
</p>
<p>as to the true state of the law, but by corrupt and wicked motives,
</p>
<p>you have the right to disregard the instructions purposely intended
</p>
<p>258 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>to mislead you. But to claim that the jury are better judges of
</p>
<p>what the law may be than the Court, is about as reasonable as to
</p>
<p>assert that a plain farmer or merchant may be taken fresh from his
</p>
<p>plough or his counter, and be more capable of navigating and
</p>
<p>manoeuvering a steam frigate, or to lead your armies to certain
</p>
<p>victories, than your admiral or commander-in-chief. In my
</p>
<p>opinion, you have just the same right to disregard the evidence
</p>
<p>of the witnesses who stood before you unimpeached in any matter
</p>
<p>respecting the facts involved in the cause, as you have to disregard
</p>
<p>what the Court may say to you, under an official oath, as to the
</p>
<p>law that may apply to the facts. A jury have the power, if
</p>
<p>they choose to exercise it, after having assumed the obligations of
</p>
<p>an oath, to say that they will neither believe the judge nor the
</p>
<p>witnesses, but decide upon the law and facts according to their
</p>
<p>own caprice, or the confidence which they may repose in the
</p>
<p>character of counsel on either side, but such is not the purpose
</p>
<p>for which juries were instituted, and they have no right so to act.
</p>
<p>When the witnesses in the cause have testified before you as
</p>
<p>to the facts, it is then the office of the judge, under his official
</p>
<p>oath, to testify to you in the spirit of truth, according to the best
</p>
<p>of his knowledge and ability, as to what is the law which may
</p>
<p>be applicable to those facts; and an honest jury will disregard
</p>
<p>neither the testimony of the witnesses nor the instructions of the
</p>
<p>judge, unless they are satisfied that corrupt motives have actuated
</p>
<p>them. They will leave the party where the law leaves him, to his
</p>
<p>legitimate redress, a writ of error to the appellate court."
</p>
<p>Referring to the course of counsel in this illegitimate appeal to
</p>
<p>the jury in their argument on this point, and to their appeal, based
</p>
<p>on the number of their exceptions to the rulings of the Court, the
</p>
<p>judge made this further remark in vindicating the position and
</p>
<p>dignity of the Court : "In reference to these matters I may
</p>
<p>observe that, perhaps, I owed it to the dignity of the bench to
</p>
<p>have interrupted counsel in the conduct of the case in this par-

<p>ticular, but in a cause involving the life of the prisoner upon the
</p>
<p>one hand and the vindication of the outraged justice of a nation
</p>
<p>in mourning upon the other, I deemed it my duty to cast not an
</p>
<p>atom in the one scale or in the other which might by any possi-
</p>
<p>bility tend to prejudice either side of the issue."
</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE BY THE COUNSEL
</p>
<p>FOR THE DEFENSE AND THEIR ANIMUS TOWARD THE
</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT AND APPEALS TO THE POLITICAL PREJUDICES
</p>
<p>OF JURORS.
</p>
<p>THE conduct of this trial on the part of the defense toward the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the prosecution was most remarkable. The law
</p>
<p>prescribes the methods by which testimony is to be discredited,
</p>
<p>and the eminent lawyers who defended the prisoner were of course
</p>
<p>well acquainted with the legal methods of impeaching testimony.
</p>
<p>That they did not confine themselves to these was not only
</p>
<p>unprofessional, but was calculated to create a suspicion that they
</p>
<p>had an intuitive perception of the fact that the methods known
</p>
<p>to the law would not avail them in this case. Hence from the
</p>
<p>first they attempted to influence the jury by treating the govern-
</p>
<p>ment witnesses with supercillious contempt, and even scorn.
</p>
<p>They did not, however, stop here, but whenever they could find
</p>
<p>or make an occasion they would throw out insinuations against
</p>
<p>the witnesses en masse by side remarks intended for the ears of the
</p>
<p>jury.
</p>
<p>They spoke of the witnesses who were kept together in a room,
</p>
<p>to be called as they were needed, as being in the " penitentiary,"
</p>
<p>and added to this that "they would soon be in another penitentiary."
</p>
<p>On the examination of Dr. McMillen, the surgeon of the ocean
</p>
<p>steamer "Peruvian," in whose charge Father La Pierre had placed
</p>
<p>Surratt under the name of McCarthy, and to whom Surratt had
</p>
<p>made confessions during his voyage across the Atlantic that were
</p>
<p>conclusive of his guilt, the counsel for Surratt made themselves so
</p>
<p>offensive that the witness was provoked to a retort in self-defense.

</p>
<p>This witness was intolerable to them because of the directness
</p>
<p>26O ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>and force of his testimony. In self-defense the Doctor was pro-
</p>
<p>voked into making the following remark: He said he would
</p>
<p>tell the counsel (Mr Merrick), and if he was not deaf, he could
</p>
<p>hear, and repeated his answer, adding that Mr. Merrick had
</p>
<p>insulted witness the other day, and that it was the act of a coward
</p>
<p>and a sneak. The Court here cautioned the witness that such
</p>
<p>language was not becoming, but also remarked "that it was not
</p>
<p>becoming in counsel to try to worry witness into bad temper."
</p>
<p>Witness stated "that Mr. Merrick had remarked the other day
</p>
<p>that all the witnesses in the adjoining room ought to go to the
</p>
<p>penitentiary, or something to that effect; that he was just as good
</p>
<p>as Merrick."
</p>
<p>On the following day, at the opening of the court, Mr. Bradley
</p>
<p>said : " If your honor please, before we proceed with the trial of
</p>
<p>this case, I beg leave to call the attention of the Court to an
</p>
<p>incident which occurred just before the adjournment yesterday, and
</p>
<p>to ask that the notes of the reporter may be read. Your honor
</p>
<p>was very much occupied at the time, and I desire that the record
</p>
<p>may be read in order that you may see what passed, and what led
</p>
<p>to the attack made by the witness upon the stand upon the counsel
</p>
<p>with whom I am associated, your honor, without having heard
</p>
<p>what passed at that time, if not in precise words yet in substance,
</p>
<p>censured the counsel to whom these observations were addressed.
</p>
<p>I think, in looking at it, your honor will see that there was no
</p>
<p>provocation given ; and that if there was, it is due to the dignity
</p>
<p>of this court, and to the protection of the members of the bar, to
</p>
<p>which they are entitled at the hands of the Court, that some notice
</p>
<p>should be taken of what then passed." After the reading of so
</p>
<p>much of the report as related to the matter, the Court spoke as
</p>
<p>follows : " I did not hear what was said by the witness in regard to
</p>
<p>the gunboats, for the reason that I was at the time occupied in
</p>
<p>preparing some passes for a friend. When my attention was
</p>
<p>called to the remark made use of by the witness towards the
</p>
<p>counsel, I was under the impression that he had been provoked to

</p>
<p>it by something that had been said by the counsel. I cannot, how-
</p>
<p>ever, perceive in the record which has been read anything which
</p>
<p>ought to have called forth, or which justifies, the expression of the
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 261
</p>
<p>witness. I will say now to the witness, that although Mr. Merrick
</p>
<p>did say a few days ago, in regard to the witnesses who were in the
</p>
<p>adjoining room (which Mr. Bradley had called a penitentiary)
</p>
<p>that they (the witnesses) would soon be in another penitentiary,
</p>
<p>or words to that effect, it is not the privilege of a witness to take
</p>
<p>exception in the way he did to any remarks made in the court
</p>
<p>room. He may appeal to the Court to protect him if he is
</p>
<p>aggrieved." [Turning to witness] " You must not, hereafter, -in your
</p>
<p>examination, make use of any expressions to counsel which are at
</p>
<p>all insulting in their character, however much you may feel yourself
</p>
<p>aggrieved by remarks which they may have made in reference to
</p>
<p>witnesses generally, or in reference' to yourself before your
</p>
<p>examination.
</p>
<p>" In this connection it may not be improper to observe that I
</p>
<p>have never, in all my judicial experience, seen a case in which
</p>
<p>there has been so much trouble with regard to the examination of
</p>
<p>witnesses and so much bitterness of feeling displayed.
</p>
<p>" It may be all right, but I confess I see no reason why it should
</p>
<p>be so. I cannot, of course, enter into the feelings of counsel, and
</p>
<p>it is possible they may feel themselves aggrieved, and therefore
</p>
<p>regard themselves as justified in exhibiting this spirit. I will say,
</p>
<p>further, that I have never seen witnesses cross-examined with so
</p>
<p>much asperity as I have in the case now pending. It does not
</p>
<p>appear to me, therefore, as at all strange that witnesses should be
</p>
<p>worried into such remarks as this witness has uttered, especially
</p>
<p>when intimations are publicly thrown out by counsel as to their
</p>
<p>fitness for the penitentiary, and that, too, when some of the most
</p>
<p>respectable persons in the land, such, for instance, as General
</p>
<p>Grant and Assistant Secretary Seward, are among the number.
</p>
<p>And not even was the effect of the remark allowed to stop with
</p>
<p>the intimation, but when attention was called to it by the District
</p>
<p>Attorney, in the hope, I presume, that it would be recalled, it was
</p>
<p>repeated, and with the additional observation that the propriety of
</p>
<p>the remark could be shown. When such things occur it is not at

</p>
<p>all surprising that witnesses should come here prepared to avenge
</p>
<p>themselves by making insulting replies to the counsel. I deeply
</p>
<p>deplore it, and will endeavor, by most carefully observing all that
</p>
<p>262 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>transpires, to prevent a similar recurrence on the part of either
</p>
<p>counsel or witnesses ; but however watchful the Court may be, such
</p>
<p>things will occasionally break forth at times and under circum-
</p>
<p>stances when, from not expecting it, it is impossible for the Court
</p>
<p>to check them." [Again addressing himself to the witness.] " Dr.
</p>
<p>McMillen, you are highly reprehensible for having made such
</p>
<p>remarks as that to which exception has been taken. It was
</p>
<p>altogether out of place. If you felt yourself aggrieved by any
</p>
<p>remark, you should have called on the Court for protection. You
</p>
<p>will now proceed to give your evidence, and in a manner respect-
</p>
<p>ful to the counsel. If the counsel on either side shall treat you
</p>
<p>with what you conceive to be disrespect, you will appeal to the
</p>
<p>Court, and the Court will intervene for your protection. I would,
</p>
<p>however, suggest to gentlemen on both sides that in the exam-
</p>
<p>ination of witnesses, if they will consult Quintilion and Allison in
</p>
<p>regard to their duty in this respect (and no doubt they have read
</p>
<p>the remarks of both these authors on the subject), they will find
</p>
<p>that those writers say nothing is to by gained by a bitterness of
</p>
<p>manner toward witnesses either on examination in chief or cross-
</p>
<p>examination, but that everything may possibly be gained by kind-
</p>
<p>ness and conciliatory manners ; and I think it would be a decided
</p>
<p>improvement in this case if their suggestions were accepted. In
</p>
<p>the course of the five years that I was engaged in prosecuting
</p>
<p>criminal cases, I do not recollect ever to have had an unkind
</p>
<p>word with a witness on the one side or the other, and never in
</p>
<p>a civil case except on one occasion, when a witness of my own
</p>
<p>turned against me. Then I was led away by a natural quickness
</p>
<p>of temper. I advise that we should all, to the best of our ability,
</p>
<p>endeavor to control our tempers in conducting this case ; and then
</p>
<p>there will be no fear of a repetition of the unpleasant occurrences
</p>
<p>that have happened during its progress."
</p>
<p>To this Mr. Merrick replied : " I feel it incumbent upon me to
</p>
<p>say, after what has fallen from the Court, especially as your honor
</p>
<p>seems to have the impression that I intended my remarks to

</p>
<p>apply to all the witnesses, including Secretary Seward and General
</p>
<p>Grant, that while your honor misunderstood me in this regard,
</p>
<p>I do not believe I was misunderstood by some others outside, in
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 263
</p>
<p>supposing I intended to embrace all the witnesses in that remark.
</p>
<p>I will here say that I have the greatest respect for General Grant
</p>
<p>and Mr. Seward, and I apprehend that among the witnesses in the
</p>
<p>case it is perfectly well understood to whom I referred and to whom
</p>
<p>I did not refer. I apprehend that no sane man can suppose that I
</p>
<p>meant any such reference to General Grant, Mr. Seward, or Mrs.
</p>
<p>Seward, and that class of witnesses. I will only say, in conclu-
</p>
<p>sion, that I think, without any further explanation, or more direct
</p>
<p>pointing of the remark at present, it is perfectly well understood
</p>
<p>among the witnesses to whom the remark referred."
</p>
<p>To this the Court replied : " I do not know whether it is under-
</p>
<p>stood or not. I cannot understand it, because I am bound not to
</p>
<p>know the witnesses, either as regards their own private character,
</p>
<p>or the character of their testimony, and I enter into the trial of
</p>
<p>this case knowing nothing, as it were, about either, scarcely ever
</p>
<p>having glanced at the testimony, and of course, therefore, I cannot
</p>
<p>enter into the feelings of counsel on the subject. I do not know
</p>
<p>to what witnesses these remarks may be directed, but this I do
</p>
<p>know, that there are certain legal methods pointed out in the text
</p>
<p>books of the law by which we are to be guided in undertaking to
</p>
<p>discredit the testimony of witnesses. One method is the discredit-
</p>
<p>ing of the witness by himself ; by his own contradictions, and by his
</p>
<p>mode and manner of testifying. Another is by proving the wit-
</p>
<p>ness to be utterly devoid of reputation for truth and veracity, and
</p>
<p>not to be believed on his oath. Another is by contradicting him
</p>
<p>by the conflicting testimony of other witnesses. These are the legal
</p>
<p>modes that are pointed out in the law books, and any side remarks
</p>
<p>that are made by way of prejudicing a jury, any acting in the
</p>
<p>case, the casting of sinister looks at the jury, are departures from
</p>
<p>the rules laid down.
</p>
<p>" The examination of a witness ought to be conducted by the wit-
</p>
<p>ness standing up and the counsel standing up, and looking each other
</p>
<p>in the face, without the counsel directing his remarks to the jury
</p>
<p>by turning towards them instead of turning towards the witness.

</p>
<p>That is the proper way to conduct either an examination in chief
</p>
<p>or a cross-examination. "
</p>
<p>The fact that the Court deemed it necessary to deliver such a
</p>
<p>264 A SSA SSINA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>lecture as this to counsel, who were men of age and experience in
</p>
<p>their profession, and who from their reading ought to have been as
</p>
<p>well informed as the Court on the proper treatment of a witness and
</p>
<p>the legal methods of discrediting testimony, indicates that he had
</p>
<p>found in their conduct such flagrant departures from the require-
</p>
<p>ments of law and professional conduct a necessity for such criticism
</p>
<p>and such admonitions. The opinion of the Court as thus expressed
</p>
<p>fully justifies me in the charges I have made against the conduct
</p>
<p>of the defense and their unprofessional efforts to discredit testimony.
</p>
<p>I am still futher justified in it by the remark of Mr. Merrick that they
</p>
<p>(the counsel for the defense) " had laid at the feet of the attorneys
</p>
<p>a mass of the most corrupt battalion that was ever summoned to
</p>
<p>support a cause in a criminal court. "
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Merrick attempts to set aside all of the testimony that
</p>
<p>had been offered by the goverment proving the guilt of the prisoner,
</p>
<p>by denouncing it as corrupt throughout, and unworthy of the slightest
</p>
<p>consideration. This would certainly be as easy a method as it would
</p>
<p>be novel to throw out testimony en masse upon the mere ipse dixit of
</p>
<p>counsel, and in consequence of the legal standing and weight of
</p>
<p>character claimed by them with such manifest self complacency,
</p>
<p>but when we consider the fact that upon a candid and careful
</p>
<p>scrutiny of all the testimony in the case, it could be set aside in
</p>
<p>no other way, we could not perhaps reasonably expect them to re-
</p>
<p>frain from trying to get the benefit of all the method that was left
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>The most important witnesses introduced by the government and
</p>
<p>those who most unequivocally proved the existence of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>and the connection of the prisoner with it, as also his participancy
</p>
<p>in its accomplishment, and also the fact that his mother belonged
</p>
<p>to it and performed a part in preparing for its accomplishment, had
</p>
<p>stood every test that ingenuity could devise to discredit their testi-
</p>
<p>mony. Some of them had been kept on the stand under cross ex-
</p>
<p>amination for nearly two days, and could not be made to discredit
</p>
<p>their own testimony, either by contradictions or mode of answering.

</p>
<p>Neither had they been discredited by proving that they were utterly
</p>
<p>devoid of character for truth and veracity, and not to be believed on
</p>
<p>oath. The attempts at their contradiction by the conflicting testimony
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 265
</p>
<p>of other witnessess had all proven miserable failures, and so the
</p>
<p>counsel for the defense attempted to have their client declared inno-
</p>
<p>cent by scouting all of the evidence in the case and offering their
</p>
<p>own convictions of his entire innocence, and referring the jury
</p>
<p>to their weight of character and legal standing to enforce their
</p>
<p>opinions on the jury as grounds for a favorable verdict for their
</p>
<p>client. Never did able lawyers deal more unfairly with witnesses
</p>
<p>nor with evidence, nor more wantonly set at naught the established
</p>
<p>rules of evidence, not only in the respects referred to, but also
</p>
<p>in the efforts that they made to introduce testimony which they
</p>
<p>must have known to be inadmissible under the rules of evidence,
</p>
<p>as already shown in the number of exceptions which they not only
</p>
<p>took to the rulings of the court, but kept count of and paraded
</p>
<p>before the jury. Their animus toward the government was also
</p>
<p>shown in this matter of testimony, as also in other ways to be
</p>
<p>hereafter noticed. They charged the government with presenting
</p>
<p>testimony on this trial that it knew to be false, and withholding
</p>
<p>testimony from the military commission that would have proven the
</p>
<p>innocence of Mrs. Surratt. To sustain the first charge, they asserted
</p>
<p>in regard to the handkerchief found by Blinn at the Burlington
</p>
<p>depot, that it had been dropped by a government detective, and not
</p>
<p>lost by Surratt. Blinn, however, was positive in his testimony that
</p>
<p>he found the handkerchief on the morning of the 1 8th, but the hand-
</p>
<p>kerchief which Hallohan, the detective, claimed to have lost, was
</p>
<p>lost at Burlington on the morning of the 2Oth of April. He did not
</p>
<p>discover its loss, however, until he got to Essex Junction, and did not
</p>
<p>know where he had lost it. The handkerchief found by Blinn on
</p>
<p>the morning of the i8th, and put in evidence by the government,
</p>
<p>could not therefore have been the handkerchief that Hallohan
</p>
<p>claimed to have lost. There was also too heavy a cloud of un-
</p>
<p>certainty hanging over his (Hallohan's) testimony after his cross-
</p>
<p>examination, to have warranted the counsel in making so serious
</p>
<p>a charge against the government as that it knew that Hallohan, and
</p>
<p>not Surratt, lost the handkerchief.

</p>
<p>In further proof of the charge that they disregarded and set at
</p>
<p>naught the rules of evidence, they tried to get in a statement by
</p>
<p>John Matthews of the contents of an article put into his hands by
</p>
<p>266 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Booth on the afternoon of the I4th of April, with a request that if
</p>
<p>he (Booth) did not see him before 10 o'clock on the following
</p>
<p>morning he should hand it to the National Intelligencer for publi-
</p>
<p>cation, and which Matthews, after the assassination, had burned,
</p>
<p>thinking it would put him in danger to have such a thing found in
</p>
<p>his possession. They proposed to prove by this witness that neither
</p>
<p>the prisoner nor his mother were in the conspiracy. Of course
</p>
<p>they knew that they could not prove the contents of a paper that
</p>
<p>would have been inadmissible even if it had been presented. But
</p>
<p>if they had had the paper in their possession they could not
</p>
<p>have proven anything by it, as it was represented to be a paper
</p>
<p>prepared by Booth to justify himself in the crime he had in con-
</p>
<p>templation, and would have been no more admissible as evidence
</p>
<p>than the diary which Booth kept during his flight, every entry in
</p>
<p>it having been made in view of his probable failure to make his
</p>
<p>escape, and with the intention of palliating his crime. It was of
</p>
<p>no more value as evidence than was his assertion of the entire in-
</p>
<p>nocence of his companion, Herold, just a few minutes before he was
</p>
<p>shot. Yet they censured the government for not putting this diary
</p>
<p>in evidence before the Commission, asserting that its reason for with-
</p>
<p>holding it was that it would have proven the innocence of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, thus by implication asserting that the government was
</p>
<p>thirsting for her blood, and was determined that she must be con-
</p>
<p>victed right or wrong.
</p>
<p>This position was boldly taken by them in their arguments, as we
</p>
<p>shall hereafter see, in the face not only of the evidence on which
</p>
<p>she was declared guilty by the Commission, but also in the face of that
</p>
<p>presented on this trial, which much more clearly and fully established
</p>
<p>her guilt. I have thus been careful to show from the record that
</p>
<p>I am justified in the strictures I am making on the course of the
</p>
<p>defense. I would be sorry to do any injustice to these men if they
</p>
<p>were here to answer for themselves, much more so now that the
</p>
<p>two senior members, Mr. Bradley and Mr.Merrick, are numbered with
</p>
<p>the dead. My charitable conclusion in their behalf is that their

</p>
<p>political opposition to the government so prejudiced their minds
</p>
<p>that they could not bring themselves into a judicial frame for the
</p>
<p>trial of this case. Their religious sympathies with Mrs. Surratt,
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 267
</p>
<p>and their ready acceptance of the assertion of Father Walter that
</p>
<p>she was " as innocent as the newborn babe," so influenced their
</p>
<p>minds that they would reject as false any testimony whatever that
</p>
<p>went to establish her guilt. Their sympathies then would naturally
</p>
<p>lead them to conduct the defense of her son in the same spirit of
</p>
<p>determination to hold him innocent in spite of all adverse testimony.
</p>
<p>The prisoner found his counsel in a state of mind to readily ac-
</p>
<p>cept the ingenuous fabrication which he had had two years to get
</p>
<p>into form, as also no doubt the able assistance of the Reverend
</p>
<p>Fathers who so sedulously watched for his return to Canada after the
</p>
<p>murder of the President, and who at once took him under their
</p>
<p>protection on his return to Montreal, and kept him secreted for five
</p>
<p>months, until they could get him landed in the Pope's dominions ;
</p>
<p>and then when he was brought back and put upon his trial, stood
</p>
<p>by him from day to day with unfaltering fidelity, until he was set at
</p>
<p>liberty.
</p>
<p>The story which Surratt gives in his Rockville, Md., lecture, which
</p>
<p>bears throughout the marks of the " fine Italian hand " of the Jesuit,
</p>
<p>and which is contradicted in all of its most important points by the
</p>
<p>whole run of the testimony in the two trials, had no doubt been
</p>
<p>accepted by his counsel as true, and hence they would hear no
</p>
<p>testimony that conflicted with it ; but were ready to accept any
</p>
<p>evidence whatever, without regard to the character of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>that corroborated it. This, in the opinion of the author, is the most
</p>
<p>charitable construction that can be put upon their conduct in the
</p>
<p>management of their case. Their eyes were blinded by their all
</p>
<p>controlling prejudices, and bitter opposition to the course of the
</p>
<p>government in sending Surratt's co-conspirators before a military
</p>
<p>commission for trial. We shall now proceed to give the evidence
</p>
<p>of their feelings toward the government in this matter. They could
</p>
<p>apparently find no words bitter enough to express their abhorrence
</p>
<p>of the trial by a commission.
</p>
<p>As John H. Surratt and his mother were bound up in the same
</p>
<p>bundle by all the testimony in the case, and his mother had been

</p>
<p>found guilty upon this testimony by the court before which she
</p>
<p>was tried, his counsel seemed to feel the necessity of getting rid of
</p>
<p>the effect of this fact, in its bearing on their case. That I may
</p>
<p>268 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>not be accused of doing them injustice in presenting their mode of
</p>
<p>doing this, I will let them speak for themselves.
</p>
<p>In the examination of jurors on their voire dire, Mr. Pierrepont
</p>
<p>asked the question : " Have you formed any opinion in regard to
</p>
<p>the guilt or innocence of the other conspirators ? " The question
</p>
<p>was objected to by the counsel for the defense, and Mr. Merrick,
</p>
<p>to sustain his objection, said, among other things : " I presume
</p>
<p>there is scarcely a gentleman in the United States who has not
</p>
<p>formed and expressed the opinion that Booth shot Lincoln. I
</p>
<p>apprehend there are very few who have not formed and expressed
</p>
<p>an opinion that the mother of the prisoner at the bar suffered
</p>
<p>death without competent testimony to convict her, and so we
</p>
<p>might go through in an inquiry in relation to all the others. " In
</p>
<p>replying, Mr. Pierrepont said: "The reason urged by my learned
</p>
<p>friend against it is, that he believes, I do not know but that he
</p>
<p>asserts, that there are very few in the United States who do not
</p>
<p>believe that Mrs. Surratt was illegally executed. Therefore we
</p>
<p>could not get a jury competent to try the prisoner at the bar if
</p>
<p>this question is allowed to be put."
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick [interrupting]. " My brother will allow me to say
</p>
<p>that he did not state my entire proposition. I said there were few
</p>
<p>intelligent persons in the United States who had not formed an
</p>
<p>opinion upon the question of Booth's participation in the killing of
</p>
<p>Lincoln ; and there were also, I presumed, but few persons who had
</p>
<p>not formed an opinion that Mrs. Surratt had been executed upon
</p>
<p>insufficient evidence. "
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierrepont. " Precisely; that is the very statement, except
</p>
<p>that my friend has made it a little stronger than I did.
</p>
<p>" I did not intend to overstate it, as there is nothing gained by
</p>
<p>overstatement, but it seems I did not come up to the mark." . . .
</p>
<p>In his opening for the defense, Mr. Joseph H. Bradley, Jr., said:
</p>
<p>"We have at last arrived at that stage of this case when an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity is afforded the prisoner for saying something by way of
</p>
<p>defense, not only of his own character, his own reputation, his life

</p>
<p>and his honor, but also as it shall rise incidentally in this discussion
</p>
<p>of this evidence before you, something in the way of vindicating
</p>
<p>the pure fame of his departed mother. " Again. " As to Mrs.
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 269
</p>
<p>Surratt we hope to satisfy you that a grave error has been made
</p>
<p>in her case. " Again Mr. Merrick, in his argument on the motion
</p>
<p>to strike out certain testimony, said: '"The counsel had said, if it
</p>
<p>was anything favorable, the defense would insist on it ; if anything
</p>
<p>unfavorable, they would not desire it. All he had to say in reply
</p>
<p>was, that he would insist on the free confession of all who had
</p>
<p>testified in the case, if he could get it. He would like to have had
</p>
<p>the privilege of putting in whatever this poor boy's butchered
</p>
<p>mother said, but had not. When he offered what she said, counsel
</p>
<p>on the other side said, ' No, you cannot prove that. We can
</p>
<p>prove what she said that will benefit the state, but you shall not
</p>
<p>throw the mantle of a mother's declarations over the child standing
</p>
<p>in the prisoner's dock.' Had we been allowed, we would have
</p>
<p>proved her declarations proved them when tottering from the
</p>
<p>dungeon to the scaffold, with the world behind her, and nothing in
</p>
<p>the front but that God before whom she was shortly to appear, and
</p>
<p>before whom she solemnly asseverated that she was innocent
</p>
<p>of the crime for which she was being killed. "
</p>
<p>To all these charges and assumptions the District Attorney, in his
</p>
<p>argument upon the evidence, replied as follows : " Well, I do most
</p>
<p>kindly but most respectfully and emphatically repudiate the unjust
</p>
<p>imputation that Mary E. Surratt has been murdered, as was alleged
</p>
<p>by one of the counsel, and butchered as alleged by another.
</p>
<p>Where is the evidence to justify it? If they have a right to make
</p>
<p>this accusation, have we not a right to reply to it? For what pur-
</p>
<p>pose was it introduced before this jury? Is it to appeal to your
</p>
<p>prejudices? I make no such accusation against the gentlemen;
</p>
<p>they charge it home upon us when they say a murdered and a
</p>
<p>butchered woman. I deny it, and I undertake to prove to the
</p>
<p>contrary. "
</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley, interrupting, said " he supposed this threw the whole
</p>
<p>subject open for discussion." The District Attorney rejoined :
</p>
<p>" It had been introduced by the learned gentlemen on the other
</p>
<p>side. " Mr. Bradley replied " that he was not aware what evi-

</p>
<p>dence there was on which this question could be discussed. But
</p>
<p>if it was understood that the whole subject was open, and that the
</p>
<p>counsel for the prisoner could not be interrupted in their discussion
</p>
<p>of it, he was satisfied."
</p>
<p>270 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>The District Attorney. " Then why make allusion to it in the
</p>
<p>first instance? Who cast the first stone in the presence of this
</p>
<p>jury?
</p>
<p>" I regret that it should have been necessary for an American
</p>
<p>woman to be executed by the judgment of an American tribunal.
</p>
<p>That verdict has been rendered by an American tribunal, and the
</p>
<p>consequence of it was the execution of an American woman. I
</p>
<p>know the character of the American people. I know that imagin-
</p>
<p>ation revolts at the execution of one of the tender sex. But when
</p>
<p>the daughter of Herodias murdered John the Baptist, she deserved
</p>
<p>death. When Lucretia Borgia darkened the history of her country
</p>
<p>by her horrid crimes, she deserved death. And when Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt murdered Abraham Lincoln, the great moral hero of the
</p>
<p>age in which he lived, the patriot and philanthropist of the nine-
</p>
<p>teenth century, she deserved death. There is no man who has a
</p>
<p>heart more capable of love for woman than myself. But when she
</p>
<p>unsexes herself, when she conceives, when she encourages, when
</p>
<p>she urges on, and is instrumental in committing the crime of mur-
</p>
<p>der, she places herself beyond the pale of protection. The best
</p>
<p>wife who ever lived, according to Milton, our great mother Eve, is
</p>
<p>thus represented as speaking to her husband:
</p>
<p>" ' What thou biddest,
</p>
<p>Unargued I obey; so God ordains:
</p>
<p>God is thy law, thou mine.'
</p>
<p>" I believe in submission on the part of women ; submission to
</p>
<p>her God, to the laws of her country and to her husband. But
</p>
<p>when a woman opens her house to murderers and conspirators,

<p>them to the crime of murder and treason, I say boldly, as an

<p>American officer, public safety, public duty, requires that an
</p>
<p>example be made of her conduct. Murder ! gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury. Who composed that military commission? They are no

<p>better men than you are, but you will not be offended with me
</p>
<p>if I say they are as good men as you are, or I, or any of us."

<p>Naming over the officers who constituted the tribunal by which
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt was tried, he continued : " I say, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 271
</p>
<p>jury, that they are good men, holding commissions under the
</p>
<p>government of the United States, and they are presumed to be
</p>
<p>honorable men. The law declares that every private citizen, and
</p>
<p>every public officer who is a servant of the American people, is
</p>
<p>presumed to be honorable until the contrary is proved.
</p>
<p>" Your officers, your men, your representatives in the American
</p>
<p>army, in an accusation which will travel upon the telegraph wires
</p>
<p>perhaps to the four quarters of the world have been denounced, if
</p>
<p>not expressly, by implication, as murderers and butchers who took
</p>
<p>the life of an innocent woman. If so, when you come to try them^
</p>
<p>and you believe it, say it, but it is not the question submitted ta
</p>
<p>you now. She may be innocent and the prisoner at the bar be
</p>
<p>guilty ; the subject was introduced collaterally by the learned
</p>
<p>counsel, for what purpose I know not, except for effect. Before
</p>
<p>you brand these gentlemen with the character of murderers, see
</p>
<p>that you have relevant grounds to act upon. Take care, or you-
</p>
<p>may be placed in the same situation ; I have not charged it, and
</p>
<p>I do not think my friends would, upon reflection, charge men who
</p>
<p>are placed in such a solemn obligation with such a dereliction of
</p>
<p>duty. It has been said that this has been pronounced by the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States an illegal tribunal. What
</p>
<p>has that to do with the action of these officers? What has that
</p>
<p>to do with your action ? What pertinency can it have to the issue
</p>
<p>now submitted to you for your decision? But, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, let us first consider the character of this crime, and then I
</p>
<p>will consider briefly the connection of Mrs. Surratt with it. I do-
</p>
<p>not desire to say much about her; she has gone to her grave,,
</p>
<p>and her spirit has passed before her Eternal Judge."
</p>
<p>After recounting the character of the crime, the District At-
</p>
<p>torney thus refers to Mrs. Surratt's connection with it : " Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, let us view the connection of Mrs. Mary
</p>
<p>E.' Surratt with this assassination. I feel the delicacy of the
</p>
<p>ground upon which I stand. I know the situation. I know that
</p>
<p>you dislike to consider this question, which has been forced upon

<p>you. I do not want to do it. My duty is to prosecute the pris-
</p>
<p>oner, but one of the counsel has said she was murdered, and
</p>
<p>another that she was butchered, and it therefore becomes my
</p>
<p>2/2 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>duty to trace her connection with this crime, and then leave it to
</p>
<p>you to say whether she was guilty (though not relevant to this
</p>
<p>case) of the crime for which she suffered. First, I call your
</p>
<p>attention to a fact to which we have already adverted ; that her
</p>
<p>house, 541, was the rendezvous for these conspirators. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, will you pause for a moment, and let me ask you how
</p>
<p>you can reconcile it with innocence? You remember the law,
</p>
<p>that it is not how much a party did, but whether she had anything
</p>
<p>to do with it. Can you, I say, reconcile it with innocence that
</p>
<p>this woman's house should have been the rendezvous of John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, Lewis Payne, Atzerodt, Herold, and John H. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt? Would you not know by intuition? Would you not know
</p>
<p>by their conversation? Would not your judgment and your hearts
</p>
<p>tell you who they were and what they contemplated?
</p>
<p>That is the great central truth, which I defy the learned counsel
</p>
<p>'for the defense successfully to assail. Secondly, who furnished
</p>
<p>the arms with which the bloody deed was done? . . . The
</p>
<p>woman who puts an arm into the hand of her lover, her son, her
</p>
<p>brother, or her husband, who urges him on to the deed, by the
</p>
<p>law of God and of man is equally guilty with the one who with his
</p>
<p>own hand perpetrates the crime. According to the testimony of
</p>
<p>John M. Lloyd this is shown. Do you believe him or disbelieve
</p>
<p>him? My friend, Mr. Bradley, who opened this case said he was
</p>
<p>a common drunkard ; but mark you, he was an attendant and
</p>
<p>friend of Mrs. Surratt."
</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley. "Who says so? "
</p>
<p>The District Attorney. " I will prove it. When I was examin-
</p>
<p>ing that witness, and proposed to ask him certain questions in
</p>
<p>reference to Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, he said, ' Mr. Carrington,' for
</p>
<p>he knew me personally, ' I don't wish to speak about Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt, for she is not on trial.' I said ' Go on, Mr. Lloyd.' He
</p>
<p>declined. I applied to the Court, and the Court said that it was
</p>
<p>his duty to answer. He saw her continually. He lived in her
</p>
<p>house ; he drank her liquor. Why, this evidence shows that John

<p>H. Surratt, Herold, and John M. Lloyd played cards and drank
</p>
<p>together. . . . But says the friend and companion of the
</p>
<p>prisoner at the bar, the confiding and confidential agent of his
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 273
</p>
<p>mother, unwilling to testify against her when put on the solemn
</p>
<p>sanction of an oath, but when required to do so he speaks out,
</p>
<p>he says certain arms were furnished him by the prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar; that he concealed them, the prisoner showing him where
</p>
<p>they could be safely concealed, he protesting at the time against
</p>
<p>it, protesting that it might get him into some personal difficulty.
</p>
<p>The mother knew of the transaction, for on the nth of April we
</p>
<p>have Lloyd's own testimony ; she asked him where those shooting-
</p>
<p>irons were, and said they might soon be needed, or words to that
</p>
<p>effect. But I am going too fast, for I do not desire . to speak to
</p>
<p>confuse you. I say, first, that her house is the rendezvous ; and
</p>
<p>that, secondly, she furnishes arms, or knows of their being
</p>
<p>furnished. On the night of the I4th of April, Booth and Herold
</p>
<p>returned, and are leaving the city of Washington in flight for their
</p>
<p>lives. At Surrattsville they called for whiskey from the agent and
</p>
<p>friend of the prisoner and his mother. She gives them a home,
</p>
<p>gives them arms, gives them whiskey, not to nerve them but to
</p>
<p>refresh them after the commission of their horrid crime.
</p>
<p>"But Booth, in making his escape, needs something more than
</p>
<p>whiskey and arms.
</p>
<p>"It is necessary that he should secrete himself as he traveled
</p>
<p>through the country, and that he should see persons approaching
</p>
<p>him from an immense distance, he needs a field-glass, and has it
</p>
<p>delivered to him by his friend and agent, Mrs. Surratt. " With the
</p>
<p>defense no witness told the truth whose testimony went to convict
</p>
<p>their client, whilst the stories of the most infamous men, self-con-
</p>
<p>fessed scoundrels and accomplices after the fact, if not before, such
</p>
<p>as Father Boucher, and Reverend Cameron, must be taken as
</p>
<p>gospel truth. 1 In the face of all this testimony the counsel for
</p>
<p>the defense again bring their false accusations against the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. Merrick in the course of his argument, said : " Does
</p>
<p>the Attorney General feel that public justice demands that he
</p>
<p>should employ assistant counsel in this case, or is there somebody
</p>
<p>else behind?" . . . " Are there any other officers of the federal

</p>
<p>the learned attorney on the other side (Mr. Pierrepont) in a
</p>
<p>speech delivered I think before you were impaneled :
</p>
<p>"'It has likewise been circulated through all the public journals
</p>
<p>that after the former convictions, when an effort was made to go to
</p>
<p>the President for pardon, men, active here at the seat of govern-
</p>
<p>ment, prevented any attempt being made, or the President even
</p>
<p>being reached for the purpose of seeing whether he would not
</p>
<p>exercise clemency; whereas the truth, and the truth of record,
</p>
<p>which will be presented in this court is, that all this matter was
</p>
<p>brought before the President, and presented to a full cabinet meet-
</p>
<p>ing, where it was thoroughly discussed, and, after such discussion,
</p>
<p>condemnation, and execution received not only the sanction of the
</p>
<p>President, but that of every member of his cabinet. This and a
</p>
<p>thousand others of these false stories will be all set at rest forever
</p>
<p>in the progress of this trail; and the gentlemen may feel assured
</p>
<p>that not only are we ready, but that we are desirous of proceeding
</p>
<p>at once with the case.' Now if this declaration of my learned
</p>
<p>brother on the other side is correct, this trial was not entered
</p>
<p>upon for the purpose alone of inquiring into the guilt or innocence
</p>
<p>of the prisoner at the bar. It -was not entered upon because
</p>
<p>public justice demanded his arraignment, before you, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>but in order that a thousand false stories about men high in office
</p>
<p>might be settled at his expense.
</p>
<p>" Then, although my learned brother is here under appointment
</p>
<p>by the Attorney General of the United States, yet it is an appoint-
</p>
<p>ment which probably had its origin in the stimulus of some private
</p>
<p>feeling lying behind. He comes here, not to try this case alone,
</p>
<p>but he comes here to set at rest certain false stories. Has he
</p>
<p>done it?" . . . "Where is your record? Why didn't you bring
</p>
<p>it in ? Did you find at the end of the record a recommendation to
</p>
<p>mercy in the case of Mrs. Surratt that the President never saw?
</p>
<p>You had the record here in court. "
</p>
<p>Mr. Bradley. "And offered it once and withdrew it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick. "Yes, sir, offered it and then withdrew it. Did

</p>
<p>you find anything at the close of it that you did not like ? Why
</p>
<p>didn't you put that record in evidence, and let us have it here?
</p>
<p>We were not going to quarrel about it ; we would like to know all
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 275
</p>
<p>we can about the dark secrets of those chambers whose doors are
</p>
<p>closed, but from which light enough creeps to make us anxious
</p>
<p>to look within. We only know enough to make us curious ; but
</p>
<p>that is enough to make us feel. You were going to show, too,
</p>
<p>that nobody prevented access to the President on the part of those
</p>
<p>who waited to get a pardon. Why didn't you do it? Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, I should have been glad to have heard that proof.
</p>
<p>They have brought these charges into the case and I must meet
</p>
<p>them as part of the case. I should have been glad to have heard
</p>
<p>that proof. Who of you who was in the city of Washington,
</p>
<p>will ever forget that fatal day when the tolling of the bells reminded
</p>
<p>you of the sad fact that the hour had come when those people
</p>
<p>were to be hung? Your honor (referring to Justice Wylie,
</p>
<p>who was at the time sitting beside Judge Fisher on the bench),
</p>
<p>in your praise be it said, raised your judicial hand to prevent
</p>
<p>that murder, but it was too weak. The storm beat against your
</p>
<p>arm, and it fell powerless in the tempest. You remember that
</p>
<p>day, gentlemen. Twenty-four hours for preparation. The echoes
</p>
<p>of the announcement of impending death, scarcely dying away
</p>
<p>before the tramp of the approaching guard was heard leading to
</p>
<p>the gallows. Priest, friend, philanthrophist, and clergyman went
</p>
<p>to the Executive Mansion to get access to the President, to implore
</p>
<p>for that poor woman three days respite to prepare her soul to meet
</p>
<p>her God, but got no access. The heart-broken child the poor
</p>
<p>daughter went there crazed, and, stretched upon the steps that
</p>
<p>lead to the Executive chamber, she raised her hands in agony
</p>
<p>and prayed to every one that came, ' O God ! let me have access,
</p>
<p>that I may ask for but one day for my poor mother just one
</p>
<p>day.' Did she get there? No. And yet, says the counsel,
</p>
<p>there was no one to prevent access being had. Why don't you
</p>
<p>prove it? O, God! if such a thing could have been proved, how
</p>
<p>would I not have rejoiced in that fact ; for when reflecting upon
</p>
<p>that sad, unfortunate, wretched hour in the history of my country
</p>
<p>an hour when I feel she was so much degraded, I could weep

<p>until the paper be worn away with the continual dropping of my
</p>
<p>tears. Who stood between her and the seat of mercy? Has
</p>
<p>conscience lashed the chief of the Bureau of Military Justice?
</p>
<p>2/6 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>[Gen. Joseph Holt.] Does memory haunt the Secretary of
</p>
<p>War? Or is it true that one who stood between her and Executive
</p>
<p>clemency now sleeps in the dark waters of the Hudson, while
</p>
<p>another died by his own violent hand in Kansas?
</p>
<p>"The learned gentleman is right. He did come here to put
</p>
<p>these things at rest, or to endeavor to put them at rest ; but he could
</p>
<p>not do it. What else is there in this case to show a feeling behind,
</p>
<p>besides public justice impelling to conviction? Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, as the counsel has stated in his speech, public rumors had
</p>
<p>gone abroad, and certain grave charges had been made. You
</p>
<p>know that political accusations had been brought against Judge
</p>
<p>Holt, Mr. Bingham, and the Secretary of War, in the House of
</p>
<p>Representatives, and that it had become a political matter." (Mr.
</p>
<p>Merrick here referred to an effort that had been made by rebel
</p>
<p>sympathizers in Congress to make political capital out of this
</p>
<p>transaction.) "There were parts of those accusations that the
</p>
<p>learned counsel was going to put at rest. Where is the proof?
</p>
<p>The proof is in this ; follow me for a moment.
</p>
<p>" I said I would show there was a conspiracy on conspiracy.
</p>
<p>What has the chief of the Bureau of Military Justice got to do with
</p>
<p>this case? Does not your honor hold an independent court? Is
</p>
<p>not the judicial tribunal of the land separate from the executive?
</p>
<p>Is it not a fundamental principle of American constitutional law that
</p>
<p>the executive and judicial departments shall be distinct and separate ?
</p>
<p>The Bureau of Military Justice is a part of the executive depart-
</p>
<p>ment. What has he to do with this case? Nothing, says the
</p>
<p>counsel. Is he counsel? we ask. No, say they. Why, then, is he
</p>
<p>manipulating their witnesses in this case ? Smoot, one of their wit-
</p>
<p>nesses, tells you that he is called up before Judge Holt, with ten
</p>
<p>others, examined, and his examination was taken down in writing.
</p>
<p>The day after giving his testimony he comes back and says that
</p>
<p>it was not Judge Holt that examined him, but was somebody else.
</p>
<p>" I pressed him, pressed him hard, as to the place and time. He
</p>
<p>then recollected it was in the Winder Building, opposite the War

</p>
<p>Department ; and when I pressed him still further, he had to say that
</p>
<p>the office he was in had written over the door ' Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>General's office. ' Again I ask what had the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 277
</p>
<p>General to do with this case? Not only was Smoot there, but
</p>
<p>Norton was there, and God only knows how many more. It is
</p>
<p>apparent, then, that he has taken a deep interest in this case. Why
</p>
<p>is he taking such an interest? It is certainly indiscreet. He has
</p>
<p>lost his prudence and he has lost his discretion ; he has lost his judg-
</p>
<p>ment thus to expose himself and his office in a criminal prosecution.
</p>
<p>" Mr. District Attorney, gird on your loins and answer me.
</p>
<p>Whose discretion is broken down? Whose prudence is betrayed?
</p>
<p>Is there anybody else's heart at which the vulture gnaws ? Is there
</p>
<p>any high and great man who is forgetting the dignity of his office
</p>
<p>and the duties of a moral creature so far as to descend to the prepara-
</p>
<p>tion of witnesses with which he has nothing to do to satiate his hunger
</p>
<p>with the blood of an innocent being? . . . But I am now speak-
</p>
<p>ing of the Bureau of Military Justice. He you know has furnished
</p>
<p>the evidence in this case."
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick then went on to charge the government with pre-
</p>
<p>paring and presenting evidence against Surratt that it knew to be
</p>
<p>false, and then proceeded as follows : " No matter whether they
</p>
<p>knew the truth in this case or not, prudence has been betrayed ;
</p>
<p>discretion has been broken down ; courage has been conquered.
</p>
<p>Following on Judge Pierrepont's declaration, which I have read to
</p>
<p>you, and these circumstances, comes Mr. Carrington, breaking the
</p>
<p>cerements of the tomb, and demanding your verdict against Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt. In God's name isn't it enough to try the living? Will
</p>
<p>you play the gnome, and bring her from the cold, cold earth and
</p>
<p>hang her corpse? Bring her in ; but there is no occasion for doing
</p>
<p>so ; she is here already. We have felt our blood run cold as the
</p>
<p>rustling of the garments from the grave swept by us. Her spirit
</p>
<p>moves about, and the Judge Advocate General and all these men
</p>
<p>may understand that it is the eternal law of God, though, so far as
</p>
<p>men are concerned, fresh and innocent blood may apparently vin-
</p>
<p>dicate innocent blood previously shed, yet the spirit will still walk
</p>
<p>beside them.
</p>
<p>" He may shudder before her, because she is with him by day

<p>and by night ; and he may say
</p>
<p>" ' Avaunt and quit my sight ! Let the earth hide thee;
</p>
<p>Thy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold.'
</p>
<p>2/8 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>But the cold blood and marrowless bones are still beside him,
</p>
<p>and her whisperings are presaging that great judgment day when
</p>
<p>all men shall stand equal before the throne of God, and when Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt is called to testify against Joseph Holt, what will he in vin-
</p>
<p>dication say? . . .
</p>
<p>" Mr. Carrington, your honor, has gone outside of this record, and
</p>
<p>I must follow him to some extent, at least. He has gone outside
</p>
<p>of it in speaking of the military commission, defending the major
</p>
<p>generals and others. I am glad I recurred to it, for it reminds me
</p>
<p>of a statement of his that I desire to correct. He says we accused
</p>
<p>those honorable men of murder. No, sir ; I refrain from any ex-
</p>
<p>pression of opinion on that subject. It is true the most exalted
</p>
<p>judicial tribunal in the world, vindicating the liberty of American
</p>
<p>citizens and their constitutional rights against military authority,
</p>
<p>and maintaining the supremacy of the courts over military law, have
</p>
<p>pronounced that, and all other commissions similarly constituted, to
</p>
<p>be illegal ; but what I denounce here is not the men who in judg-
</p>
<p>ment sat there, but the men conducting the trial, and who with this
</p>
<p>diary of Booth in their hands could have proved Mrs. Surratt's
</p>
<p>innocence by showing this conspiracy to have been organized on
</p>
<p>the 1 4th day of April, but who, though producing the toothpick
</p>
<p>and the penknife found on Booth, yet never so much as disclosed
</p>
<p>the fact that such a diary existed.
</p>
<p>" They never made it known to those men or to the country.
</p>
<p>Do they not deserve to be denounced ? Now that it has become
</p>
<p>known to the country, they come in before this jury to get them,
</p>
<p>with the diary in evidence before them, to find the same verdict
</p>
<p>that the military commission found.
</p>
<p>" I put a question to a witness on that stand (referring to Father
</p>
<p>Walter) and asked him, ' Did you administer the consolations of
</p>
<p>religion to Mrs. Surratt?' 'I did. I gave her communion on
</p>
<p>Friday, and prepared her for death. ' I asked him, ' Did she tell
</p>
<p>you as she was marching to the scaffold that she was an innocent
</p>
<p>woman ? ' I told him not to answer the question before I directed

</p>

<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 279
</p>
<p>to defend herself, can you not at least have charity enough to let
</p>
<p>her last words come in in her defence ? Will you try one who is
</p>
<p>not only absent from the court, but is dead? While trying one
</p>
<p>that is dead, will you deny to her the poor privilege of having the
</p>
<p>last word she uttered on earth spoken in her vindication? Were
</p>
<p>you afraid of it? Did you feel that the words would sink deep
</p>
<p>into the hearts of everybody that was here in this room, and in
</p>
<p>the United States, and cause to well up from that heart a fountain
</p>
<p>of mercy, rich and pure as the fountain that sprang from the rock
</p>
<p>at the bidding of the sacred rod ? Shame on you ! Prepared for
</p>
<p>the world to come, and marching to the scaffold, with her God
</p>
<p>before her and the world behind her, and a load of sin laid at the
</p>
<p>feet of Almighty God, and no hope but in that eternal mercy upon
</p>
<p>which we must all rely, I ask whether she cannot at such an hour
</p>
<p>speak for herself? No! you answer. Why not? is it likely she
</p>
<p>would lie? No, gentlemen, they will not say that. Then why is
</p>
<p>it? They did not want to hear it. Oh, they must indeed be
</p>
<p>hardened of heart, reckless of guilt, and indifferent to justice. But
</p>
<p>although they had no desire to hear it, they do hear it, and you
</p>
<p>hear it, for as that voice spoke then, it speaks now, and will con-
</p>
<p>tinue to speak until justice is meted out. It whispers and is

<p>heard. It descends upon the head of that boy, and breaths on

<p>would seem as if the ordinary feelings of humanity and common
</p>
<p>respect for the dead, to say nothing of regard for the honor of our
</p>
<p>country and sympathy for the sufferings of a distracted and loving

<p>daughter, would suggest to those pressing the prosecution (and

<p>who have charge of the matter) to allow this poor girl the privilege

<p>of paying a simple tribute to a mother's love by having her remains

<p>280 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick then went on to meet the argument that Surratt
</p>
<p>had confessed his guilt by flight by declaring that the mad pas-
</p>
<p>sions of the hour, and tyrannical usurpations of the government in
</p>
<p>its method of dealing with those charged with this crime, by send-
</p>
<p>ing them before a military commission instead of a civil court for
</p>
<p>trial, justified him in his flight.
</p>
<p>He then went on to vindicate the Catholic Church, which he
</p>
<p>claimed had been assailed in this matter. The only reference to
</p>
<p>the Catholic Church in connection with this trial had been made
</p>
<p>in the public press. The prosecution had carefully abstained from
</p>
<p>any assault on that church, and had tried to exclude religious
</p>
<p>prejudices from the minds of the jurors.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick, however, seized the occasion to pass an eulogium
</p>
<p>on that church, in which he showed as much disregard for the
</p>
<p>facts of history as he did for the proven facts in this case. Per-
</p>
<p>haps he felt this vindication to be called for from the fact that
</p>
<p>most of the conspirators were Catholics in religion, and the further
</p>
<p>fact that the friends who waited and watched for the return of his
</p>
<p>client to Montreal after the assassination, and who, on his return,
</p>
<p>spirited him away and kept him secreted for five months and then
</p>
<p>helped him off to Italy, where he was found in the ranks of the
</p>
<p>Pope's army, and who voluntarily came before the court on his
</p>
<p>trial to testify, and to procure testimony in his behalf, were priests
</p>
<p>of that church. In his eulogium on that church he forgot to
</p>
<p>mention the fact that the Pope at an early period of the war
</p>
<p>acknowledged the Southern Confederacy and wrote a sympathiz-
</p>
<p>ing letter to Jefferson Davis, in which he called him his dear son
</p>
<p>and denounced President Lincoln as a tyrant. He could scarcely
</p>
<p>have forgotten that the Pope of Rome had sought to take advan-
</p>
<p>tage of the arduous struggle in which our government was engaged
</p>
<p>for the preservation of its life, to establish a Catholic Empire in
</p>
<p>Mexico, and had sent Maximillian, a Catholic prince, to reign over
</p>
<p>that, at that time, unhappy people, under the protection of the
</p>
<p>arms of France, lent to the furtherance of his unholy purpose by

<p>the last loyal son of the church that ever occupied a throne in
</p>
<p>Europe. Perhaps he did not realize that it was God who frus-
</p>
<p>trated that last grasp of the drowning man at a straw that eluded
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 281
</p>
<p>his grasp, by preparing for his holiness, the Pope, and for Louis
</p>
<p>Napoleon just at that moment the Franco-Prussian war, which
</p>
<p>resulted in the final loss of his temporal power to the Pope and
</p>
<p>with it his grip on the world, and of his empire and crown to the
</p>
<p>last servile supporter of his temporal pretensions. To claim for
</p>
<p>that church, as Mr. Merrick did, friendship to civil liberty, respect
</p>
<p>for the rights of conscience and of private judgment, and love for
</p>
<p>our republican institutions, is to ignore, or set at naught, all the
</p>
<p>dogmas of that church on the above questions and all the claims
</p>
<p>of the Papacy. Mr. Merrick manifestly thought that the attitude
</p>
<p>of the Catholic clergy toward the assassination of the President
</p>
<p>could be hidden from public view by his fulsome eulogy.
</p>
<p>The appeals made by the eminent counsel for the prisoner to
</p>
<p>the political and religious prejudices of jurors was ably seconded
</p>
<p>all through the trial by the Jesuit priesthood of Washington City
</p>
<p>and the vicinity. It will be recalled by scores of people who
</p>
<p>attended the trial that not a day passed but that some of these
</p>
<p>were in the court-room as the most interested of spectators. That
</p>
<p>they were not idle spectators may be inferred from the fact that
</p>
<p>whenever it seemed necessary to the prisoner's counsel to find wit-
</p>
<p>nesses to contradict any testimony that was particularly damaging
</p>
<p>to their cause they were always promptly found, and were almost
</p>
<p>uniformly Catholics in religion, as shown by their own testimony
</p>
<p>on their cross-examination. It was a remarkable fact, also, that
</p>
<p>these witnesses were scarcely ever able to come from under the
</p>
<p>fire of Judge Pierrepont's searching cross-examinations uncrippled,
</p>
<p>and also that when they took the risk of bringing two witnesses in
</p>
<p>rebuttal of the same testimony their witnesses uniformly killed
</p>
<p>each other off before they got through the ordeal that tests the
</p>
<p>truthfulness of witnesses the cross-examination. Other outside
</p>
<p>influences were brought to bear on jurors, such as these : Father
</p>
<p>John B. Menu, from St. Charles College, spent a day in the court-
</p>
<p>room, sitting beside the prisoner all day, thus saying to the jury,
</p>
<p>"You see which side I am on." A great many of the students

<p>from the same college also visited the trial, it being vacation, and
</p>
<p>they uniformly took great pains to show their sympathy with the
</p>
<p>prisoner by shaking hands with him. The press also was prosti-
</p>
<p>282 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>tuted almost daily by publishing cunningly devised paragraphs im-
</p>
<p>pugning the motives of the government in the prosecution and man-
</p>
<p>agement of the case. Thus were the prejudices of jurors appealed
</p>
<p>to and efforts also made to pervert public opinion.
</p>
<p>I have quoted thus at length from Mr. Merrick's argument to show,
</p>
<p>first the animus of the defense toward the government, and especially
</p>
<p>toward the Judge Advocate General, Joseph Holt, and the Secretary
</p>
<p>of War at time of the assassination, Edwin M. Stanton. These two
</p>
<p>officers of the government need no vindication at my hands before
</p>
<p>the loyal people of this country, as they were never denounced by
</p>
<p>any but rebels, whose especial venom against them would be the
</p>
<p>strongest presumptive evidence of their virtue and efficiency. A
</p>
<p>purer man, a truer patriot, a braver, more intelligent and able officer
</p>
<p>than Gen. Joseph Holt never will grace the pages of American his-
</p>
<p>tory. He was only hated and denounced by rebels because of his
</p>
<p>faithfulness to duty and efficiency in its performance. Of Edwin
</p>
<p>M. Stanton, also, it is needless for me to say a word. His place is
</p>
<p>fixed in history, and his record cannot be blurred by the false and
</p>
<p>vile charges or insinuations of his enemies, for his enemies were
</p>
<p>only found amongst the enemies of his country, and precisely for the
</p>
<p>same reason that they were enemies of the Judge Advocate General.
</p>
<p>The charges here so boldly made that they stood between Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt and an appeal to the Executive for clemency, was shown to
</p>
<p>be false by Judge Pierrepont, who produced the official record of the
</p>
<p>trial of the conspirators, together with a paper signed by some mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the court recommending commutation of the sentence of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt to imprisonment for life on account of her age and sex, and
</p>
<p>showed that this whole record had been laid before the President and
</p>
<p>a full cabinet, and that after mature discussion and consideration it
</p>
<p>had received their unanimous approval, with the exception of the
</p>
<p>request for the commutation of Mrs. Surratt's sentence which, though
</p>
<p>not a part of the record, was presented with it ; and that the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's order for the execution of the sentence of the court had been
</p>
<p>written on the back of this very record.

</p>
<p>These papers containing this whole record were handed to Mr.
</p>
<p>Merrick, who tossed them from him indignantly, afterwards assign-
</p>
<p>ing as his reason for doing so that he had learned to distrust every-
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 283
</p>
<p>thing that came from the Bureau of Military Justice. His real reason
</p>
<p>was that he did not desire to be estopped from reiterating the
</p>
<p>falsehoods he had so boldy proclaimed.
</p>
<p>His denunciation of the Judge Advocate General for assisting
</p>
<p>the prosecution by furnishing them with witnesses, to prove facts
</p>
<p>found on his records, if he did indeed thus assist, is unmerited ; as
</p>
<p>it is not only the duty of every private citizen, but of every public
</p>
<p>officer as well, to assist, if it be in his power to do so, in securing
</p>
<p>the ends of justice where crimes have been committed, and the safety,
</p>
<p>peace, and welfare of society put in jeopardy. His deliberate false
</p>
<p>assumption that the prosecution had put Mrs. Surratt on trial is
</p>
<p>worthy of note, as he himself dragged her case in even before a
</p>
<p>jury was impaneled; and his colleague, Mr. Jos. H. Bradley, Jr., in
</p>
<p>his opening speech, had also brought it up in such a way that the
</p>
<p>District Attorney was forced to notice it. It was evidently a pre-
</p>
<p>meditated scheme of the defense, and was done for the purpose of
</p>
<p>appealing to the prejudices of jurors, and of making political capital.
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick's protrayal of the scenes incident to the execution
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Surratt was a fine piece of eloquent and pathetic declamation.
</p>
<p>We cannot but deplore, however, that the fine sensibilities of the
</p>
<p>counsel had not found occasion for their display in the case of the
</p>
<p>widow and orphan child of the martyred President, rather than in
</p>
<p>the person of one proven guilty of complicity in his assassination,
</p>
<p>and of being so actively engaged in that tragedy that she had traveled
</p>
<p>twenty miles on that fatal Friday afternoon to carry, at Booth's re-
</p>
<p>quest, a field glass which he had delivered to her for the purpose,
</p>
<p>to Surrattsville, to be deposited and delivered by Lloyd, at her re-
</p>
<p>quest, along with the carbines and the whiskey, to the assassins on
</p>
<p>that night, when fleeing from the seat of their crime, and from
</p>
<p>offended justice. It is to be deplored that he had no tears for the
</p>
<p>crazed widow and orphan child of the murdered President, when
</p>
<p>he could find such a generous fountain for his murderers. Such,
</p>
<p>however, is the deplorable effect of political and religious pre-
</p>
<p>judice on frail human nature, that it perverts our moral sensibilities

</p>
<p>and warps our judgment. Mr. Merrick could see nothing but
</p>
<p>innocence in the prisoner and his mother, although the proof of
</p>
<p>their guilt was piled mountain high. It will have been noticed that
</p>
<p>284 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>he unequivocally asserts that the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States had decided that the commission that tried the assassins
</p>
<p>was an illegal tribunal. We shall have occasion hereafter to
</p>
<p>show that this is untrue.
</p>
<p>If the counsel for the defense was not aware of this fact, it was
</p>
<p>because they had failed to grasp the meaning of the decision to
</p>
<p>which they referred, and on which they relied.
</p>
<p>It was neither fair nor honest in them, after dragging into the
</p>
<p>trial the question of Mrs. Surratt's guilt or innocence, and that
</p>
<p>for the purpose we have above indicated, to endeavor, in the face
</p>
<p>of the facts, to shift the burden of the responsibility for this on to
</p>
<p>the prosecution. It was equally dishonest to insinuate that the
</p>
<p>prosecution of John H. Surratt was not entered upon alone for the
</p>
<p>purpose of ascertaining his guilt or innocence, but in order that the
</p>
<p>false stories that had been published in regard to the course of the
</p>
<p>government in executing Mrs. Surratt might be set at rest. The
</p>
<p>most eloquent counsel for the defence, ably assisted by his colleagues,
</p>
<p>endeavored to put the government, and not the prisoner, on trial
</p>
<p>before the jury, and before the country. They uniformly and boldly
</p>
<p>asserted his innocence, whilst they arraigned the government for
</p>
<p>having murdered, according to one, and butchered according to
</p>
<p>another, an innocent woman ; and also of being in this trial engaged
</p>
<p>in an endeavor to cover up the guilt of shedding her innocent blood,
</p>
<p>by shedding the blood of her innocent son. To cap the climax
</p>
<p>of their audacity Mr. Bradley, after reiterating the charges made by
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick and Joseph H. Bradley, Jr. , asked the jury, in making
</p>
<p>up their verdict, to make a written statement at the same time of
</p>
<p>their belief that Mrs. Surratt had been unjustly condemned, and
</p>
<p>found guilty upon insufficient evidence.
</p>
<p>They charged the government with dishonesty in withholding
</p>
<p>Booth's diary from the commission ; claiming thdt it would have
</p>
<p>proven Mrs. Surratt's innocence. They could not have failed to
</p>
<p>know, as able lawyers, that this diary was of no account whatever
</p>
<p>as evidence. It was no more admissible than was Atzerodt's con-

</p>
<p>fession, as every entry that was made in it was made with the
</p>
<p>almost certainty of his capture in view, and for the purpose
</p>
<p>of concealing the greatness of the conspiracy and its personnel.
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 285
</p>
<p>It was of no more value than was his declaration in favor of his
</p>
<p>fellow-conspirator, Herold, that he was an innocent man, made a few
</p>
<p>moments before he was shot.
</p>
<p>In his argument on the defense of an alibi set up by the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick makes great account of the evidence of the detectives
</p>
<p>who visited and searched Mrs. Surratt's house at two o'clock on the
</p>
<p>morning of the I5th of April, that Mrs. Surratt declared that John
</p>
<p>was not there, and that she had not seen him for two weeks.
</p>
<p>She claimed that he was in Montreal, and that she had received
</p>
<p>a letter from him on the day previous. They well knew that her
</p>
<p>declarations had no value as testimony, and that there was evidence
</p>
<p>flatly contradicting her statements.
</p>
<p>That she had received the letter as claimed, was true ; but that
</p>
<p>that letter had been written for the very purpose of being used in
</p>
<p>the defence of an alibi is evident from its contents, when considered
</p>
<p>in connection with the evidence in the case. It will be remembered
</p>
<p>that Wiechmann, who was a boarder in the house, answered the door-
</p>
<p>bell, when the detectives rang it for the purpose of demanding admit-
</p>
<p>tance, that they might search the house. He rapped at Mrs. Surratt's
</p>
<p>door and informed her as to who was at the door and what they
</p>
<p>had come for. Her answer was, " For God's sake, let them come
</p>
<p>in ; I have been expecting them." 1 When they inquired for her son
</p>
<p>she said, " He is not here ; I have not seen him for two weeks."
</p>
<p>This was a sufficient answer, but her guilty conscience would not
</p>
<p>let her stop here, she had to add, " There are a great many mothers
</p>
<p>who do not know where their sons are." Let us ask ourselves at
</p>
<p>this point, how many mothers in Washington City at that hour of
</p>
<p>that eventful night were lying awake expecting their houses to be
</p>
<p>searched by detectives? Our inner consciousness will unerringly
</p>
<p>dictate the answer, " Not one who was innocent of crime. " It is
</p>
<p>only necessary to say, further, in regard to this defense set up, of
</p>
<p>an alibi, that although there is no more common defense resorted
</p>
<p>to by criminals, because there is none more easy of establishment,
</p>
<p>there was never perhaps in all the history of jurisprudence a weaker

</p>
<p>and more unsuccessful effort made to establish it than in this defense.
</p>
<p>The effort made by the prisoner to establish an alibi showed plainly
</p>
<p>1 See p. 394, Trial of Surratt; also supplemental affidavit of L. J. Wiechmann.
</p>
<p>286 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>that he had endeavored to prepare for it, in anticipation for his
</p>
<p>defense, and that, in this preparation he had had able help. There
</p>
<p>is good reason to conclude that he and a half dozen other of his
</p>
<p>friends in Canada had found an opportunity to visit Canandaigua
</p>
<p>in disguise, for the purpose of doctoring up a hotel register to be
</p>
<p>used in evidence. The effort after all, proved a miserable failure.
</p>
<p>That he went from Montreal to Elmira, N.Y., leaving the former
</p>
<p>place at two o'clock on the morning of the I2th of April, was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted. There was evidence that he was in Elmira on the morning
</p>
<p>of the 1 3th, and two or three credible witness were found who swore
</p>
<p>that they saw him there either on the I3th or I4th. They were
</p>
<p>willing to conclude that it might have been on the I4th ; but would
</p>
<p>not positively swear that it was. On the other hand the government
</p>
<p>produced two witnesses who identified him as a man whom they
</p>
<p>saw on the road making his way towards Baltimore, on the I3th,
</p>
<p>one of whom ferried him over the Susquehanna river, and stopped
</p>
<p>mid-stream to collect his fare, and so talked with him and had a
</p>
<p>good look at him. It was then proven by nearly a dozen witnesses
</p>
<p>that they saw him in Washington City on the I4th. So that the
</p>
<p>great preponderance of evidence was against the alibi ; and so it
</p>
<p>legally failed. The defense was lame and weak at every point in the
</p>
<p>light of the evidence, which all tended to show the prisoner's guilt.
</p>
<p>It was only strong in the bold efforts of his counsel to scout all
</p>
<p>the testimony against him, and to have the jury accept their
</p>
<p>assertions of his innocence, backed by their weight of character
</p>
<p>as lawyers, in lieu of evidence, to establish his innocence, and in
</p>
<p>contumning and rejecting that which established his guilt.
</p>
<p>They also made great complaint that they were not allowed to
</p>
<p>prove by John Matthews, the contents of the paper which he
</p>
<p>alleged was put into his hand by Booth, a few hours before the
</p>
<p>commission of his crime, with the request that he would, on the
</p>
<p>following day, upon certain contingencies, give it to the editor of
</p>
<p>the National Intelligencer for publication, and which Matthews
</p>
<p>claimed to have destroyed. Of course they knew that nothing

</p>
<p>could be proven by this paper, much less by evidence as to its
</p>
<p>contents, yet, when it was not admitted by the court, they reserved
</p>
<p>an exception, and then in argument claimed that had they been

<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 287
</p>
<p>allowed the benefit of this, they could have shown that the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of assassination was not formed until that day, and that
</p>
<p>neither the prisoner nor his mother was in it.
</p>
<p>Matthews afterwards published what he said he desired to testify
</p>
<p>to, but was not permitted to do so by the Court. The statement
</p>
<p>that he claimed to be of Booth in this paper, gave the lie to
</p>
<p>Atzerodt's confession. These able lawyers knew full well that
</p>
<p>culprits, anticipating arrest and trial, could not be permitted to
</p>
<p>manufacture evidence in their own favor in advance. Yet they
</p>
<p>did not scruple to use, in an indirect way, in argument before the
</p>
<p>jury, this very testimony that had been excluded. Booth's diary,
</p>
<p>Booth's statement for publication, Atzerodt's confession, and the
</p>
<p>lecture of John H. Surratt, in which he makes his confession and
</p>
<p>statement of the affair, are all of a piece, and alike unworthy of
</p>
<p>credit, because they are all contradicted by sufficient and reliable
</p>
<p>testimony in every important particular. The eloquence of coun-
</p>
<p>sel in regard to the grave of Mrs. Surratt, who was buried in the
</p>
<p>grounds of the old arsenal, being a nameless grave, is wasted
</p>
<p>eloquence in the mind of every loyal man and woman in the
</p>
<p>country, as the heniousness of the crime of which she was con-
</p>
<p>victed, made it fitting that she should sleep in a nameless grave,
</p>
<p>and that the spot of her resting-place be unknown, as an admoni-
</p>
<p>tion to all traitors to their country, and its free institutions of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, and whose disloyalty fits them for the highest crimes that
</p>
<p>man can commit, of the infamy that awaits them in the just ver-
</p>
<p>dict of an outraged people. Mrs. Surratt's remains were given up
</p>
<p>to her daughter two years later, in 1 869.
</p>
<p>We will now give a few of the opening paragraphs of Judge
</p>
<p>Pierrepont's argument for the prosecution, in which he disposes of
</p>
<p>the outside and irrelevant matter that had been lugged into the
</p>
<p>defense, and out of which they had endeavored to make so much
</p>
<p>capital.
</p>
<p>" May it please your honor, and gentlemen of the jury, I have
</p>

<p>tunity as yet of addressing to you one word. My time has now
</p>
<p>arrived, 'Yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.' When
</p>
<p>the book of Job was written, this was true, and it is just as true

</p>
<p>to-day. A man, in order to save his life, will give his property,
</p>
<p>will give his liberty, will sacrifice his good name, and will desert
</p>
<p>his father, his brother, his mother and his sister. He will lift up
</p>
<p>his hand before Almighty God and swear that he is innocent of
</p>
<p>the crime with which he is charged. He will bring perjury upon
</p>
<p>his soul, giving all that he hath in the world, and be ready to take
</p>
<p>the chances and jump the life to come ; and so far as counsel
</p>
<p>place themselves in the situation of their client, and just to the
</p>
<p>degree that they absorb his feelings, his terror, and his purposes,
</p>
<p>just so far will counsel do the same.
</p>
<p>" I am well aware, gentlemen, of the difficulties under which I
</p>
<p>labor in addressing you. The other counsel have all told you that
</p>
<p>they know you and that you know them. They know you in
</p>
<p>social life, and they know you in political affairs. They know
</p>
<p>your sympathies, your habits, your modes of thought, your pre-
</p>
<p>judices even. They know how to address you, and how to
</p>
<p>awaken your sympathies, whilst I come before you a total
</p>
<p>stranger. There is not a face in those seats that I have ever
</p>
<p>beheld until this trial commenced, and yet I have a kind of feel-
</p>
<p>ing pervading me that we are not strangers.
</p>
<p>" I feel as though we had a common origin, a common country,
</p>
<p>and a common religion, and that, on many grounds, we must have
</p>
<p>a common sympathy. I feel as though, if hereafter I should meet
</p>
<p>you in my native city, or in a foreign land, I should meet you, not
</p>
<p>as strangers, but as friends. It was not a pleasant thing for me
</p>
<p>to come into this case. I was called into it at a time ill-suited in
</p>
<p>every respect. I had just taken my seat in the convention called
</p>
<p>for the purpose of forming a new constitution for my State, and I
</p>
<p>was a member of the judiciary committee. The convention is now
</p>
<p>sitting, and I am now absent where I ought to be present. I
</p>
<p>feel, however, that I had no right to shirk this duty.
</p>
<p>" The counsel asked whether I represented the Attorney Gen-
</p>
<p>eral in this case. They had, perhaps, the right to ask, and so
</p>
<p>asking I give you the answer. There surely is no mystery about

</p>
<p>the matter. The District Attorney, feeling the magnitude of this
</p>
<p>case, felt that he ought to apply to the Attorney General
</p>
<p>for assistance in the prosecution of it, and he accordingly made
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 289
</p>
<p>the application. I have known the Attorney General for more
</p>
<p>than twenty years. Our relations have been most friendly, both
</p>
<p>in a social and professional point of view. The Attorney General
</p>
<p>conferred with the Secretary of State, who is, as you know, from
</p>
<p>my own State, and they determined to ask me to assist in the
</p>
<p>prosecution of this cause. On receiving a letter from the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of State, I came to Washington, when I met him and the
</p>
<p>Attorney General. This is the way I happened to be here en-
</p>
<p>gaged in this case ; and I may say that I am assured that there
</p>
<p>was no member of the cabinet but those two who ever heard or
</p>
<p>knew of my retainer until after my arrival here. I have simply
</p>
<p>tried to perform my duty as I best could, but I have, no doubt,
</p>
<p>failed to a great extent. A trial, protracted as this has been, and
</p>
<p>in such oppressive weather, is indeed a trial. It is a trial to the
</p>
<p>court, it is a trial to you, it is a trial to the counsel, it is a trial to
</p>
<p>health, it is a trial to patience, and it is a trial to temper.
</p>
<p>"When the President of the United States was assassinated, Iwas
</p>
<p>one of a committee sent on by the citizens of New York to attend
</p>
<p>his funeral. When standing, as I did stand, in the east room by
</p>
<p>the side of that coffin, if some citizen sympathizing with the
</p>
<p>enemies of my country had, because my tears were falling in sorrow
</p>
<p>over the murder of the President, there insulted me, and I had at
</p>
<p>that time repelled the insult with insult, I think my fellow-citizens
</p>
<p>would have said to me that my act was deserving of condemnation ;
</p>
<p>that I had no right, in that solemn hour, to let my petty passions
</p>
<p>or my personal resentments disturb the sanctity of the scene. To
</p>
<p>my mind the sancitity of this trial is far above that funeral occasion,
</p>
<p>solemn and holy as it was, and I should forever deem myself dis-
</p>
<p>graced if I should ever allow any passion of mine or personal resent-
</p>
<p>ment of any kind to bring me here into any petty quarrel over the
</p>
<p>murder of the President of the United States. I have tried to re-
</p>
<p>frain from anything like that, and God helping me, I shall so
</p>
<p>endeavor to the end.
</p>
<p>" To me, gentlemen, this prisoner at the bar is a pure abstraction.

<p>I have no feeling toward him whatever. I never saw him until I
</p>
<p>saw him in this room, and then it was under circumstances cal-
</p>
<p>culated to awaken only my sympathy. I never knew one of his
</p>
<p>2QO ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>kindred, and never expect to know one of them. To me he is a
</p>
<p>stranger. Toward him I have no hostility, and I shall not utter
</p>
<p>any word of vituperation against him. I came to try one of the
</p>
<p>assassins of the President of the United States, as indicted before
</p>
<p>you. I laid personal considerations aside, and I hope I shall
</p>
<p>succeed in keeping them from this cause, so far as I am concerned.
</p>
<p>I believe, gentlemen, that what you wish to know in this case is
</p>
<p>the truth. I believe it is your honest desire to find out whether
</p>
<p>the accused was engaged in this plot to overthrow this government
</p>
<p>and assassinate the President of the United States. My duty is to
</p>
<p>try to aid you in coming to a just conclusion. When this evidence
</p>
<p>is reviewed, and when it is honestly and fairly presented, when
</p>
<p>passions are laid aside, and when other people who have nothing
</p>
<p>to do with the trial are kept out of the case, you will discover that
</p>
<p>in the whole history of jurisprudence no murder was ever proved
</p>
<p>with the demonstration with which this has been proven before
</p>
<p>you. The facts, the proofs, the circumstances all tend to one
</p>
<p>point, and all prove the case, not only beyond a reasonable, but
</p>
<p>beyond any doubt.
</p>
<p>" This has been, as I have already stated, a very protracted case.
</p>
<p>The evidence is scattered. It has come in link by link, and as we
</p>
<p>could not have witnesses here in their order when you might have
</p>
<p>seen it in its logical bearings, we were obliged to take it as it came ;
</p>
<p>and now it becomes my duty to put it together and show you what
</p>
<p>it is. I shall not attempt, gentlemen, to convince you by bold
</p>
<p>assertions of my own. I fancy I could make them as loudly and as
</p>
<p>confidently as the counsel on the other side, but I am not here for
</p>
<p>that purpose. The counsel are not witnesses in the cause. We
</p>
<p>have come here for the purpose of ascertaining whether under the
</p>
<p>law and on the evidence presented, this man arraigned before you
</p>
<p>is guilty as charged. I do not think it proper that I should tell
</p>
<p>you what I think about everything that may arise in the case, or
</p>
<p>that I should tell you that I know that this thing is so, and that
</p>
<p>the other is another way. My business is to prove to you from

<p>this evidence that the prisoner is guilty. If I do that I shall ask
</p>
<p>your verdict. If I do not do that, I shall neither expect nor hope
</p>
<p>for it. "
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY 7 "HE DEFENSE. 29!
</p>
<p>" I listened, gentlemen, to the two counsel who have addressed
</p>
<p>you for several days, without one word of interruption. I listened
</p>
<p>to them respectfully and attentively. I knew their earnestness, and
</p>
<p>I know the poetry that was brought into the case, and the feeling
</p>
<p>and the passion that was attempted to be excited in your breasts,
</p>
<p>by bringing before you the ghost trailing her calico dress and
</p>
<p>making it rustle against these chairs. I have none of these powers
</p>
<p>which the gentlemen seem to possess, nor shall I attempt to invoke
</p>
<p>them. I have come to you for the purpose of proving that this
</p>
<p>party accused here was engaged in this conspiracy to overthrow
</p>
<p>this government, which conspiracy resulted in the death of Abra-
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln, by a shot from a pistol in the hands of John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth. That is all there is to be proven in this case.
</p>
<p>" I have not come here for the purpose of proving that Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt was guilty or that she was innocent, and I do not under-
</p>
<p>stand why that subject was lugged into this case in the mode that
</p>
<p>it has been ; nor do I understand why the counsel denounced the
</p>
<p>military commission who tried her, and thus indirectly censured,
</p>
<p>in the severest manner, the President of the United States. The
</p>
<p>counsel certainly knew when they were talking about that tribunal,
</p>
<p>and when they were thus denouncing it, that President Johnson,
</p>
<p>President of the United States, ordered it with his own hand ; that
</p>
<p>President Johnson, President oi the United States, signed the
</p>
<p>warrant that directed the execution ; that President Johnson,
</p>
<p>President of the United States, when that record was presented to
</p>
<p>him, laid it before his cabinet, and that every single member voted
</p>
<p>to confirm the sentence, and that the President with his own hand,
</p>
<p>wrote his confirmation of it, and with his own hand signed the
</p>
<p>warrant. I hold in my hand the original record, and no other man,
</p>
<p>as it appears from that paper, ordered it. No other one touched
</p>
<p>this paper ; and when it was suggested by some of the members
</p>
<p>of the commission that in consequence of the age and the sex
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Surratt it might possibly be well to change her sentence
</p>
<p>to imprisonment for life, he signed the warrant for her death with

<p>the paper right before his eyes and there it is (handing the
</p>
<p>paper to Mr. Merrick). My friend can read it for himself.
</p>
<p>" My friends on the other side have undertaken to arraign the
</p>
<p>292 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>government of the United States against the prisoner. They have
</p>
<p>talked very loudly and eloquently about this great government of
</p>
<p>twenty-five or thirty millions of people being engaged in trying to
</p>
<p>bring to conviction one poor young man, and have treated it as
</p>
<p>though it was a hostile act, as though two parties were litigants
</p>
<p>before you, the one trying to beat the other. Is it possible that it
</p>
<p>has come to this, that, in the city of Washington, where the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent has been murdered, that when under the form of law, and
</p>
<p>before a court and jury of twelve men, an investigation is made to
</p>
<p>ascertain whether the prisoner is guilty of this great crime, that
</p>
<p>the government are to be charged as seeking his blood, and its
</p>
<p>officers as lapping their tongues in the blood of the innocent? I
</p>
<p>quote the language exactly. It is a shocking thing to hear. What
</p>
<p>is the purpose of a government? What is the business of a govern-
</p>
<p>ment? According to the gentlemen's notion, when a murder is
</p>
<p>committed the government should not do anything towards ascer-
</p>
<p>taining who perpetrated that murder ; and if the government did
</p>
<p>undertake to investigate the matter and endeavor to find out
</p>
<p>whether the man charged with the crime is guilty or not guilty
</p>
<p>the government and all connected with it must be expected to be
</p>
<p>assailed as 'blood hounds of the law,' and as seeking 'to lap their
</p>
<p>tongues in the blood of the innocent. ' Is that the business of
</p>
<p>government, and is it the business of counsel under any circum-
</p>
<p>stances thus to charge the government? What is government
</p>
<p>for? It is instituted for your protection, for my protection, for
</p>
<p>the protection of us all. What could we do without it? Tell me,
</p>
<p>my learned and eloquent counsel on the other side, what would
</p>
<p>you do without a government? What would you do in this city?
</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, a set of young men, who choose to lead an
</p>
<p>idle life, say to themselves that it is not right that some rich man
</p>
<p>living here should be enjoying his hoarded wealth, and they break
</p>
<p>into his house at night and steal therefrom. My learned friend
</p>
<p>would say, when you came to prosecute them for that robbery,
</p>
<p>' What ! would you have this great and generous government of

</p>
<p>twenty-five or thirty millions of people pursue these poor young
</p>
<p>men, who merely tried to break into the house of one of your
</p>
<p>citizens and steal his money? Should not this government be
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 293
</p>
<p>generous and let them go? Oh, yes! Let them off. Well, they
</p>
<p>are let off, and a few days afterward they break into the house of
</p>
<p>my friend, Mr. Merrick, for the purpose of stealing his money,
</p>
<p>when he, a brave man, undertakes to resist them, and in doing so
</p>
<p>they strike him down in death. Oh, generous government ! with
</p>
<p>twenty-five or thirty millions of people, let the young men off.
</p>
<p>Why should a great and generous government with all its powers
</p>
<p>be pursuing the young men who thus murdered Mr. Merrick while
</p>
<p>attempting to prevent a robbery at his house?
</p>
<p>" Why should the officers of the government be ' lapping their
</p>
<p>tongues in the blood of the innocent?' Suppose this view as to
</p>
<p>the duty of a government were universally entertained, what would
</p>
<p>be the result? How long would your government last? How
</p>
<p>long would you hold a dollar of property? How long would the
</p>
<p>safety of your daughters be secure? How long would the life of
</p>
<p>your sons, who stand in resistance to lust and rapine, be safe? I
</p>
<p>have never heard such shocking sentiments uttered in relation to
</p>
<p>the duty of government from any human lips, or from any writer
</p>
<p>on the face of the earth. We have been told here that our govern-
</p>
<p>ment has nothing of divinity that hedges it about ; that it is only
</p>
<p>the government of man's making. The Bible tells us that all
</p>
<p>government is of God ; that the powers that be are ordained of
</p>
<p>God ; and I can tell you, gentlemen, if such are the sentiments of
</p>
<p>this country that there is no divinity and no power of God that
</p>
<p>hedges about this government, its days are numbered, its condem-
</p>
<p>nation is already written, and it will lie in the dust before many
</p>
<p>years have rolled by. No government that is not of God will last.
</p>
<p>It will soon come to naught. No other government ever did long
</p>
<p>exist. No other government can exist. Every government which
</p>
<p>is a government of the people is of God, and the powers that be
</p>
<p>are ordained of God. When you come together to the polls, and
</p>
<p>you elect as the ruler of this great nation a President, he is made
</p>
<p>so by the sanction of your votes, and in that act the voice of the
</p>
<p>people becomes the voice of God. I repeat, a government which

</p>
<p>is thus instituted is ordained of God, and it is as much hedged
</p>
<p>about as that of any king that ever reigned on England's throne-
</p>
<p>Is it possible that our countrymen will say that the government
</p>
<p>294 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>which we thus have made, which our fathers established, and which
</p>
<p>we are thus cherishing, has nothing of divinity hedging it about?
</p>
<p>"Does it rest alone on human whim, without having anything
</p>
<p>sacred about it, and without any protection of the Almighty over
</p>
<p>it? If so, let me again repeat, its days are numbered; it will soon
</p>
<p>pass away. Once there was an empire in Rome. It was an em-
</p>
<p>pire which was in its day the greatest which the human mind had
</p>
<p>ever reared ; but it did not believe, or rather ceased to believe,
</p>
<p>that there was a God who ruled ; that government was of God ;
</p>
<p>and they ceased to punish great crimes, such as treason, rapine,
</p>
<p>and murder, and it happened a very short time after they ceased
</p>
<p>to inflict punishment for such crimes ceased to exercise the
</p>
<p>powers which belong to government that the Roman empire
</p>
<p>tumbled into ruins.
</p>
<p>" It was trampled down by the barbarians, and now not a son of
</p>
<p>the Caesars lives on the face of the earth, and not a descendant of
</p>
<p>a Roman matron exists anywhere in this wide universe. The em-
</p>
<p>pire perished, and crumbled into dust; nothing but its ashes remain.
</p>
<p>And thus will it ever be whenever a people cease to obey God,
</p>
<p>and cease to think that government is of God. Let us see what
</p>
<p>the Bible says on this subject ; what views were entertained in the
</p>
<p>Old Testament, and what in the New. " Mr. Pierrepont then read
</p>
<p>from ist Samuel, chapter xv, as follows:
</p>
<p>" ' Samuel also said unto Saul, the Lord sent me to anoint thee to
</p>
<p>be king over his people, over Israel ; now therefore hearken thou
</p>
<p>unto the voice of the words of the Lord.
</p>
<p>"'Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek
</p>
<p>did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
</p>
<p>up from Egypt.
</p>
<p>" 'Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
</p>
<p>have, and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman, infant
</p>
<p>and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
</p>
<p>" 'And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them

<p>of Judah.
</p>
<p>"'And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the

<p>valley.
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 295
</p>
<p>" 'And Saul said unto the Kenites, go, depart, get you down
</p>
<p>from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them ; for ye
</p>
<p>showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up
</p>
<p>out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amale-
</p>
<p>kites.
</p>
<p>"'And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah until thou
</p>
<p>comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
</p>
<p>"'And he took Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive, and
</p>
<p>utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
</p>
<p>" ' But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
</p>
<p>sheep, and of the oxen,and of the fatlings, and of the lambs, and
</p>
<p>all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them ; but every
</p>
<p>thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
</p>
<p>" ' Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying, It
</p>
<p>repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king ; for he is turned
</p>
<p>back from following me, and hath not performed my command-

<p>ments. And it grieved Samuel, and he cried unto the Lord all
</p>
<p>night.
</p>
<p>" ' And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning,
</p>
<p>it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he

<p>set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
</p>
<p>down to Gilgal.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said unto him, blessed
</p>
<p>be thou of the Lord ; I have performed the commandment of the
</p>
<p>Lord.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel said, what meaneth then this bleating of sheep
</p>
<p>in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
</p>
<p>" 'And Saul said, they have brought them from the Amalekites;
</p>
<p>for the people spared the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, to
</p>
<p>sacrifice unto the Lord thy God, and the rest we have utterly de-
</p>
<p>stroyed.
</p>
<p>" 'Then Samuel said unto Saul, stay, and I will tell thee what
</p>
<p>the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him say on.

<p>destroy the sinners of the Amalekites, and fight against them until
</p>
<p>they be consumed.
</p>
<p>" ' Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord,
</p>
<p>but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord.
</p>
<p>" ' And Saul said unto Samuel, yea, I have obeyed the voice of
</p>
<p>the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and
</p>
<p>have brought Agag, the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
</p>
<p>the Amalekites.
</p>
<p>" ' But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief
</p>
<p>of the things, which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice
</p>
<p>to the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel said, hath the Lord as great delight in burnt
</p>
<p>offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Be-
</p>
<p>hold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
</p>
<p>of rams.
</p>
<p>" ' For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
</p>
<p>as iniquity and idolatry; because thou hast rejected the word of
</p>
<p>the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
</p>
<p>" ' And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned, for I have trans-
</p>
<p>gressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words ; because I
</p>
<p>feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
</p>
<p>" ' Now, therefore, I prayed thee, pardon my sin, and turn again
</p>
<p>with me that I may worship the Lord.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee ; for
</p>
<p>thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected
</p>
<p>thee from being king over Israel.
</p>
<p>" ' And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon
</p>
<p>the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel said unto him, the Lord hath rent the kingdom
</p>
<p>of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of
</p>
<p>thine, that is better than thou.
</p>
<p>" ' And also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent ; for he
</p>
<p>is not a man that he should repent.

<p>" ' Then said Samuel, bring ye hither to me Agag, the king of
</p>
<p>the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And
</p>
<p>Agag said, surely the bitterness of death is past.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel said, as thy sword has made women childless, so
</p>
<p>shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
</p>
<p>Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
</p>
<p>" ' Then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house
</p>
<p>to Gibeah of Saul.
</p>
<p>" ' And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
</p>
<p>death ; nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul ; and the Lord
</p>
<p>repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.' "
</p>
<p>Mr. Pierrepont then read from the eighteenth chapter of St.
</p>
<p>Matthew as follows:
</p>
<p>" 'Woe unto the world because of offences, for it must needs be that
</p>
<p>offences come ; but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh.
</p>
<p>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged
</p>
<p>about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.'
</p>
<p>" Such was the order in the times of this Book. All government
</p>
<p>is of God. The powers that be are ordained of God. Now, from
</p>
<p>whom come those words ? Not from the Old Testament, but they
</p>
<p>come from the meek and lowly Jesus, the Saviour of the world, who
</p>
<p>died for you, for me, for all. It is true as the counsel have said,
</p>
<p>that God is a God of mercy ; but he says : ' Though I am a God
</p>
<p>of mercy, I will by no means clear the guilty. ' Now the counsel
</p>
<p>who has addressed you, you will remember, said in his speech, with
</p>
<p>great earnestness : ' We have had blood enough ; let us have
</p>
<p>peace. ' The question before you, gentlemen, is not about blood.
</p>
<p>The question is not about peace. The question before you is
</p>
<p>whether you have not had murder enough, and assassination enough,
</p>
<p>and crime enough, to enable us to have at least once before a civil
</p>
<p>tribunal in this land a trial and a verdict. Not a single one of all
</p>
<p>those engaged in the conspiracy has been tried before a civil tri-
</p>
<p>bunal ; and the question now is, have you not had enough of this
</p>
<p>murder, enough of this assassination, to have at least one jury of

</p>
<p>the country say so, and to say that we will stop it? You and I
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with the consequences. All we have to do is
</p>
<p>to do our duty, and ascertain whether the man is guilty. You do
</p>
<p>298 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>not punish the man ; I do not punish the man. I have not a
</p>
<p>feeling toward him of punishment, and you have no such feeling.
</p>
<p>The duty does not lie with you, nor with me ; we have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with that. The question for us is to see whether this man is
</p>
<p>guilty of this violation of the law of the land as charged ; and if
</p>
<p>so, to so declare ; and then, if for any cause, the Executive sees fit
</p>
<p>to show leniency, he will show it. If he does not, he will not. It
</p>
<p>is not for you or for me to have to say what the leniency should be.
</p>
<p>It is not for you or for me to have anything to say upon that
</p>
<p>question. Our business is, I repeat, to ascertain whether he is
</p>
<p>guilty of this violation of the law, and if he is guilty, so to say,
</p>
<p>and then afterward to say whatever we thought fit to be said with
</p>
<p>regard to any leniency. Our duty is, and the duty of the court is,
</p>
<p>to find out that one fact, and to have you pronounce your verdict,
</p>
<p>under your oath, according to the facts as you find them.
</p>
<p>" There are one or two other things that I must notice before I
</p>
<p>come to the main question. One of these is in regard to the attacks
</p>
<p>which were made by counsel yesterday upon the learned District
</p>
<p>Attorney and myself. Have you seen anything in the conduct of
</p>
<p>the District Attorney in this case that was improper? Have you
</p>
<p>seen anything but an earnest desire to discharge his duty? If I
</p>
<p>understood the counsel aright yesterday, he said that if he should
</p>
<p>stand in the place and should have done as the District Attorney
</p>
<p>had, he would expect the women, as they passed him, to gather
</p>
<p>their skirts and pull them aside, lest they be contaminated by the
</p>
<p>touch. I did not at that time know why there was so much bitter-
</p>
<p>ness of feeling thus expressed, but I have been shown since last night
</p>
<p>this record called the ' Rebellion Record,' and I find in it that on
</p>
<p>the 5th of January, 1861, Edward C. Carrington, now District
</p>
<p>Attorney, issued to the public a stirring letter calling out the militia
</p>
<p>of this District for the purpose of aiding in the protection of the
</p>
<p>government of the United States ; calling upon them to rally ; and
</p>
<p>they did rally at his call. The fact of this native born citizen of
</p>
<p>Virginia, one of your own number and living in your midst, having

</p>
<p>thus early and practically taken the side in favor of the government,
</p>
<p>when even his own State had deserted him, of course would be likely
</p>
<p>to call down the greatest bitterness and hatred against this loyal and

<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 299
</p>
<p>noble citizen on the part of a certain class. We have been told,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, by the counsel upon the other side, that the Judge
</p>
<p>Advocate General had done a great many wrong things in his life.
</p>
<p>We have been told that the military commission which Mr. Johnson
</p>
<p>had established, and he alone, had done wrong things in their prose-
</p>
<p>cution ; and we have been told, likewise, that the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>of the United States had decided that this commission was illegal.
</p>
<p>Now you would hardly expect an eminent lawyer to make such a
</p>
<p>statement unless he believed it. But he is wholly mistaken. No
</p>
<p>court in the United States has declared this commission to have
</p>
<p>been illegal. There is no such decision on record not any.
</p>
<p>" Some of these very persons are now in confinement, and if the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States had declared the commission
</p>
<p>that tried them illegal, why should they now, in a time of profound
</p>
<p>peace, be kept in prison? If such were the case would not an
</p>
<p>application have been immediately made by my learned brother
</p>
<p>for a writ of habeas corpus to release them? But nothing of the
</p>
<p>kind is done. And why? Because no such decision has ever
</p>
<p>been pronounced. No court has, and in my judgment no court
</p>
<p>will, pronounce this commission, thus formed by the President of
</p>
<p>the United States, to have been illegal. "
</p>
<p>As this is a question of the gravest importance we all ought to
</p>
<p>know whether, as claimed twice in the arguments of defendant's
</p>
<p>counsel, the military commission which tried the conspirators and
</p>
<p>assassins has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States to have been an illegal tribunal. Judge Pierrepont, as we
</p>
<p>have seen, asserts boldly that in his judgment no such decision had
</p>
<p>ever been given by that tribunal, or ever would be. That the
</p>
<p>counsel for the defense did not really so understand it he clearly
</p>
<p>shows by the fact that they had never asked for a writ of habeas
</p>
<p>corpus in behalf of those who were working out the sentence of the
</p>
<p>commission. To his opinion I will now add that of Judge Fisher
</p>
<p>as given in his charge to the jury. It is as follows:
</p>
<p>"You have been told, gentlemen, in the argument of this case,

<p>that those who were tried before that military commission, and
</p>
<p>hung upon its findings, were themselves the victims of a base and
</p>
<p>disgraceful conspiracy to murder. Brave, gallant, and honest sol-
</p>
<p>300
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>diers of their country have been held up before you as inhuman
</p>
<p>butchers of innocent men. It has been said in support of this
</p>
<p>denunciation, that the Supreme Court of the United State have, in
</p>
<p>the case of Milligan, declared that the military court which tried
</p>
<p>Herold and others for the murder of Abraham Lincoln was an
</p>
<p>illegal tribunal, organized without law, without right, and without
</p>
<p>warrant in the Constitution a mere convocation of military men,
</p>
<p>having no right to try the cause committed to them by President
</p>
<p>Jo'hnson ; and it has been said that it was convoked not to try but
</p>
<p>to condemn.
</p>
<p>" In my humble judgment the Supreme Court has made no such
</p>
<p>decision. If so, why have not the prisoners now confined upon the
</p>
<p>Dry Tortugas for complicity in the greatest crime of the age been
</p>
<p>released from their confinement? They have sympathizing friends
</p>
<p>enough to have applied any such decision in the direction of their
</p>
<p>deliverance, and they would not have remained there a week after
</p>
<p>the decision had been made to the effect that they were unlawfully
</p>
<p>restrained of their liberty. If I understand the decision in Milli-
</p>
<p>gan's case aright, it went upon the ground that the commission
</p>
<p>which tried Milligan was not organized in obedience to the act of
</p>
<p>Congress providing for the punishment of such crimes as he was
</p>
<p>charged with committing, and the opinion of the majority of the
</p>
<p>court went upon the additional ground that no hostile foot had
</p>
<p>ever pressed the soil of Indiana at the time when he was arraigned
</p>
<p>before a military tribunal there, and that, therefore, that tribunal
</p>
<p>which condemned him for acts of treason committed in that State
</p>
<p>had no. authority to try him, notwithstanding the whole nation was
</p>
<p>involved in the most terrible struggle for its life. The majority
</p>
<p>opinion being thus predicated upon a misapprehension of historic
</p>
<p>truth, we could not, perhaps, have looked for a more rightful
</p>
<p>deduction.
</p>
<p>"Unprepared, however, as all loyal hearts were for such an

<p>anouncement, the American people would be even yet more

<p>astounded to have it declared by any court in this country that
</p>
<p>the commander-in-chief of the army and navy, the President of the
</p>
<p>United States, has not the power in time of war to institute a
</p>
<p>military commission for the purpose of trying a gang of spies and

</p>
<p>traitors who have found their way within the intrenched encamp-
</p>
<p>ments of the nation's capital to take the life of the chief of the
</p>
<p>army and navy, to assassinate all the heads of the executive de-
</p>
<p>partments, in the interest of the pretended government with which
</p>
<p>the federal government was engaged in war. They who maintain
</p>
<p>such a doctrine profess to defend it upon the ground that no such
</p>
<p>power is delegated by the constitution, as they did who could find
</p>
<p>no warrant there to coerce seceding States into submission to the
</p>
<p>federal authority ; but the day has passed by when honest states-
</p>
<p>men will longer, if they ever did, regard the sovereignty of the
</p>
<p>federal Union as possessing no powers save those expressly enum-
</p>
<p>erated in the Constitution.
</p>
<p>"The government of the United States was doubtless created by
</p>
<p>the adoption of the Constitution. But when it had once been
</p>
<p>spoken into being it stood upon the same level with other nations,
</p>
<p>and was clothed with all the powers incident to an independent
</p>
<p>sovereignty under the laws of nature and of nations, and among
</p>
<p>these was the power, in time of war or great public emergency, to
</p>
<p>arrest and inflict upon spies and traitors the most summary pun-
</p>
<p>ishment, whenever and wherever the strong hand of military justice
</p>
<p>can be laid upon them. It is a power incident to the right and
</p>
<p>duty of self preservation, and ought to be exercised, just as the
</p>
<p>individual owes it to himself to strike down the assassin who is
</p>
<p>feeling for his heartstrings, without waiting to lose his own life, in
</p>
<p>order that the courts of justice may, at their leisure, proceed to
</p>
<p>try the felon according to the formularies of the law and the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution. The right of self-defense needs not to be inscribed upon
</p>
<p>parchment, either for individuals or for sovereign states. The
</p>
<p>Almighty impressed this right and duty upon the hearts and minds
</p>
<p>of men long before he wrote the decalogue upon the tables of stone.
</p>
<p>To say that this government has not the power in time of war to
</p>
<p>exercise this great duty of self-preservation, for want of warrant in
</p>
<p>the Constitution, is to condemn the action of the government in
</p>
<p>acquiring from France and Spain and Mexico and Russia territory

</p>
<p>reignty, requiring no warrant in written governmental charter;
</p>
<p>they are derived from the common law of nations, and are co-ex-
</p>
<p>istent with sovereignty.
</p>
<p>" But with this military commission, gentlemen, you have no con-
</p>
<p>cern at this time ; whether it was a legel or illegal tribunal, is not
</p>
<p>the matter on which you are now called to decide. The oath that
</p>
<p>you have taken requires that you shall ' well and truly try, and true
</p>
<p>deliverance make between the United States of America and John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt, the prisoner at the bar, whom you have in charge, and
</p>
<p>a true verdict give according to your evidence.' The prisoner
</p>
<p>stands before you indicted for the murder of Abraham Lincoln on
</p>
<p>the 1 4th day of April, 1865, in this city. About the time and
</p>
<p>place and manner of the death of your late President no contro-
</p>
<p>versy has been made in the case. If there had been your recol-
</p>
<p>lection of a nation in tears, and of a whole civilized world in
</p>
<p>mourning would have revived your memory of the sad and
</p>
<p>terrible fact. The only question, therefore, for you to determine
</p>
<p>is, whether the prisoner at the bar participated with John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth and the others named in the indictment, or either or any of
</p>
<p>them, in the diabolical crime. If, from all the evidence in the case,
</p>
<p>your minds shall be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt growing
</p>
<p>out of that evidence that the prisoner did co-operate with them ;
</p>
<p>if that shall have produced a moral conviction in your minds that
</p>
<p>the prisoner did participate in the conspiracy to murder, or in a
</p>
<p>plot to do some unlawful act which resulted in this foul murder,
</p>
<p>no consideration as to the legality or illegality of the tribunal
</p>
<p>which tried the prisoner's mother; no feelings of sympathy for
</p>
<p>other members of the family; no consideration of his youth, or
</p>
<p>that other lives have already been forfeited for the crime, should
</p>
<p>for a single moment, tempt you to step aside from the plain path-
</p>
<p>way of duty."
</p>
<p>The last paragraph quoted is directed to some of the many art-
</p>
<p>ful appeals made to the political prejudices or to the feelings of the

</p>
<p>jury to swerve them from the duty devolved upon them by their
</p>
<p>oath. The former paragraphs may well be said to set at rest for-
</p>
<p>ever the question of the right of a government to defend its life
</p>
<p>when the occasion requires it by sending offenders against its life
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 303
</p>
<p>before a military commission for trial. This question may be taken
</p>
<p>as settled, as is the question of the right of the federal government
</p>
<p>to coerce into submission a refractory State. The opportunity
</p>
<p>thus sought by the prisoner's counsel to foist upon the public mind
</p>
<p>the assertion that the Supreme Court of the United States had made
</p>
<p>a decision denying to the government this right, thus gave occasion
</p>
<p>not only for denying that such opinion had ever been delivered,
</p>
<p>but also for showing that it never could be.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that for reasons heretofore given the
</p>
<p>crime charged in the indictment was simply that of murder the
</p>
<p>murder of Abraham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>The fact of his being, at the time of his murder, the President of
</p>
<p>the United States was not mentioned. The treasonable purpose of
</p>
<p>that murder* was also omitted no reference being made to the poli-
</p>
<p>tical reasons that moved the conspirators to the commission of the
</p>
<p>crime. The counsel for the defense contended most earnestly that
</p>
<p>because of these omissions the fact of the official position of Abra-
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln and of the political motives that inspired the crime
</p>
<p>could not be taken into consideration in the trial of the prisoner.
</p>
<p>They argued that it must be regarded in law simply as the murder of
</p>
<p>a man, and as a crime no more henious in character than the murder
</p>
<p>of the humblest citizen. Had the crime of treason been alleged in
</p>
<p>the indictment the defense would have been entitled to have a list of
</p>
<p>the witnesses by whom the government expected to prove the crime
</p>
<p>in advance of the trial ; and it would have taken two witnesses to
</p>
<p>have established an overt act. The defense contended that because
</p>
<p>they were not entitled to these advantages under this indictment
</p>
<p>the prosecution could derive no advantages from the consideration
</p>
<p>of these facts ; and that the case must be treated simply as a case
</p>
<p>of murder. The spirit of their argument would rather indicate
</p>
<p>that they really regarded it in the same light that Miss Anna Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt did, as " nothing more than the death of the meanest nigger
</p>
<p>in the Union army. " ' The following is Mr. Pierrepont's reply to
</p>
<p>their argument on this point:

<p>degree to the doctrine that it was a higher crime to conspire against
</p>
<p>. the government of the United States, and through that conspiracy
</p>
<p>commit a murder upon the Chief Magistrate, than it was to murder
</p>
<p>the humblest vagabond in the streets, or words to that effect. Now
</p>
<p>that is not the doctrine of a statesman ; it is not the doctrine of the
</p>
<p>Bible ; it is not the doctrine of the law. It is a far more heinous
</p>
<p>crime to conspire against the government of the United States and
</p>
<p>to murder its President for the purpose of bringing anarchy and
</p>
<p>confusion on the land, than to murder a single individual. It is
</p>
<p>because its consequences are so much more terrible. It is because
</p>
<p>it is involving the lives of hundreds and of thousands. It is
</p>
<p>because it is involving considerations affecting the stability, the
</p>
<p>protection, the life, and the liberty, it may be, of a nation. The
</p>
<p>law of England, which I have cited, but which it would seem, my
</p>
<p>friends have not read, lays it down, and without a statute, but as
</p>
<p>the common law, that it is a crime of such heniousness as to admit
</p>
<p>of no accessories.
</p>
<p>"They, however, undertake to say that the crime of the murder
</p>
<p>of the President of the United States in time of war or great civil
</p>
<p>commotion, is not as henious a crime as it would be in England to
</p>
<p>murder the Chief of their country ; and that there is no divinity
</p>
<p>about our government. What is its origin? All government is
</p>
<p>either of God or the devil, and they will have to take their choice.
</p>
<p>I say that the government is of God, and that no other govern-
</p>
<p>ment will stand. What says the civilized world upon this subject?
</p>
<p>I wrote a note to the Secretary of State two days ago, asking
</p>
<p>him to send me the letters that were transmitted from the different
</p>
<p>governments of the civilized world upon the subject of this murder,
</p>
<p>and what do you think he sent me? He sent me the note I hold
</p>
<p>in my hand and with it this large printed volume. It takes every
</p>
<p>line and word of that book, a book of 717 pages, closely printed,
</p>
<p>to contain the letters of condolence that were written to this govern-
</p>
<p>ment from the foreign governments of the world. Entire Christen-

</p>
<p>Turk, to write for the purpose of expressing their abhorrence of

<p>sent by some 13,000 rebel prisoners, and our prisoners, at Point
</p>
<p>Lookout. Here is the paper in which these rebel prisoners, met
</p>
<p>together, passed their resolutions of condemnation, and their curse
</p>
<p>upon this crime. I would try this case before any twelve of those
</p>
<p>rebel prisoners, and feel certain of a verdict, and yet the gentlemen
</p>
<p>tell us this murder is like that of the commonest vagabond that
</p>
<p>ever walked the streets, and the crime no higher. Not so thought
</p>
<p>the rebels ; not so thought any honorable man in arms against us ;
</p>
<p>not so thinks any right-minded man upon the face of the earth."
</p>
<p>The judge in giving his charge to the jury, addressing himself
</p>
<p>to this point, spoke as follows:
</p>
<p>" Historians and text writers on the law may treat of the heinous-
</p>
<p>ness of the crime of imagining the death of a weak or a wicked
</p>
<p>king or of a wise or benignant monarch, but you know, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>as well as you know that you exist, that to murder the duly elected
</p>
<p>President of the most powerful people on earth, is not less atrocious
</p>
<p>in its character than to compass the death of a king, or an em-
</p>
<p>peror, albeit he may have sprang from the loins of the people,
</p>
<p>who have made, him their representative head, and may have no
</p>
<p>royal blood coursing through his veins. You may be told that it
</p>
<p>is a crime surpassingly heinous to take or compass the life of him
</p>
<p>who has occupied a throne simply because he may be the king of
</p>
<p>an enslaved people, but that to take the life of the President of a
</p>
<p>free republic is an offense of no greater magnitude than to murder
</p>
<p>the 'veriest vagabond that walks your streets'; but an American
</p>
<p>jury will only believe this doctrine when the people have become
</p>
<p>so demoralized and corrupt, so devoid of the love of liberty and
</p>
<p>patriotic feeling, as to prefer to have a king and ruler foisted upon
</p>
<p>them by the accident of birth or fortunate adventure, rather than
</p>
<p>have the making of their own selection of him who is to execute
</p>
<p>their laws, and, for the time being, to stand as the representative
</p>
<p>head of their collective sovereignty.
</p>
<p>" It is a mistake to suppose that a free people in any country
</p>
<p>will ever consider it a more henious crime to kill a king, or even to

<p>desire his death, than it is to assassinate a President. It is of no
</p>
<p>avail to tell you that to surround the life of a President of a republic
</p>
<p>with safeguards as sacred and powerful as those which, in mon-
</p>
<p>306 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>archies, are thrown about a king, as you have been told in the
</p>
<p>argument, is a modern idea, ' entertained only by those whose eyes
</p>
<p>have been dazzled by visions of stars and garters, and who are
</p>
<p>desirous of changing our free institutions for a monarchical form of
</p>
<p>government. '
</p>
<p>" On the contrary, they can only be opposed to guarding with
</p>
<p>sacred vigilance the life of the President of a free people who are
</p>
<p>themselves prepared to submit to the rule of a despot. Why should
</p>
<p>the people be less proud or less regardful of the life of a ruler
</p>
<p>selected by themselves, from among themselves, than they*would
</p>
<p>be of the life of him who claimed to rule over them of his own
</p>
<p>right? When this question can be sensibly answered, I shall be
</p>
<p>willing to admit that the life of a President is less worth preserving
</p>
<p>than that of a king, and that to destroy the life of a President is a
</p>
<p>crime of less atrocity than to merely desire the death of a prince ;
</p>
<p>but not till then ; nor do I believe you will."
</p>
<p>The practical legal bearing of this question on the trial was as
</p>
<p>to whether the prisoner, being proven to have been a member of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy which resulted in the death of President Lincoln by
</p>
<p>the hands of a fellow-conspirator, should be held as a principal in
</p>
<p>the crime, or only an accessory before the fact. In other words
</p>
<p>whether the court and jury could take cognizance of the official
</p>
<p>position of Abraham Lincoln without its being alleged in-
</p>
<p>the indictment. If he could be regarded as a principal and not
</p>
<p>as an accessory he could be held equally guilty with Booth
</p>
<p>although he might not have been present and assisting in the
</p>
<p>assassination.
</p>
<p>Practically, however, this was not a matter of any consequence
</p>
<p>in this trial, because it was proven beyond a doubt that the prisoner
</p>
<p>was actually present, acting a conspicious part in the execution of
</p>
<p>the plot. It was also proven by the testimony of one witness whose
</p>
<p>testimony was in no way impeached that it was he, and not Spang-
</p>
<p>ler, who prepared and fitted the bar to the door to prevent Booth
</p>
<p>being followed into the box at the theatre. The summing up of

</p>
<p>the evidence by Judge Pierrepont in his concluding speech is one
</p>
<p>of the most admirable and masterly efforts that can be anywhere
</p>
<p>found. In the first place it is a model of judicial fairness and
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE.
</p>
<p>307
</p>
<p>honesty. To him the prisoner was evidently a pure abstraction
</p>
<p>toward whom he had no feelings. His only effort was to weigh
</p>
<p>impartially the evidence in the case, and to give to it a fair and
</p>
<p>common sense interpretation. He brushed away all side issues
</p>
<p>and every effort of the prisoner's counsel to bring the trial under
</p>
<p>the influence of political and of religious perjudices, and held them
</p>
<p>strictly to the question of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, as
</p>
<p>shown by the evidence. Again it was a model effort in its logical
</p>
<p>ability in bringing the evidence before the jury. He had so com-
</p>
<p>pletely analyzed the testimony that he was able to present it in its
</p>
<p>logical connection as to time, purpose, and circumstances ; tracing
</p>
<p>the plot through the evidence before him, from its incipiency to its
</p>
<p>completion, step by step, showing the bearing and relation that one
</p>
<p>thing sustained to another in a most conclusive and unanswerable
</p>
<p>way.
</p>
<p>He had systematically and logically arranged the testimony,
</p>
<p>which had necessarily been presented in a most desultory and un-
</p>
<p>satisfactory way, from the fact that the evidence had to be taken
</p>
<p>just as witnesses were found to be present. By great care and
</p>
<p>labor the judge had arranged the evidence just in the order in which
</p>
<p>he would have chosen to introduce it had the witnesses all been at
</p>
<p>his command at the momeuit he would have chosen to use them.
</p>
<p>Having thus arranged the testimony, he simply read it to the jury,
</p>
<p>stopping when necessary to comment on it and interpret it. His
</p>
<p>fair, natural, common sense interpretation of the facts proven
</p>
<p>could not fail to bring conviction to every intelligent, and candid
</p>
<p>mind. That the proof before him had brought to the mind of this
</p>
<p>eminent and experienced advocate and jurist the most complete
</p>
<p>conviction of the prisoner's guilt, is shown throughout his argument.
</p>
<p>He did not, however, leave the matter of his own convictions to be
</p>
<p>the subject merely of inference, but left himself on record on this
</p>
<p>point as follows :
</p>
<p>" In this case I feel justified in saying, that the prisoner is proved

</p>
<p>to be guilty, and in as overwhelming a manner as any man was
</p>
<p>ever proven guilty in the history of jurisprudence. I appeal to
</p>
<p>any judge, any lawyer, any man who has had experience, if there
</p>
<p>was ever a case where the guilt of the party, was more clearly
</p>
<p>308 ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>demonstrated. He is proven guilty not only beyond a reasonable
</p>
<p>doubt, but beyond the possibility of any doubt. There is not a man of
</p>
<p>you who can doubt it. It has been a strange case. It was a strange
</p>
<p>providence that brought the man back here to be tried. And
</p>
<p>now that he is here, you, the twelve men who in the providence
</p>
<p>of God have been selected to try the case, are to say whether
</p>
<p>what he has done is right or not right ; whether he is guilty or
</p>
<p>not guilty.
</p>
<p>" That is for you to say, not for me. I know he is proved guilty.
</p>
<p>About that there can be no doubt. I do not believe that any of
</p>
<p>you have any doubt whatever on that subject."
</p>
<p>That the purpose of this conspiracy was to assassinate the heads
</p>
<p>of the government from its very first inception, is made clear by
</p>
<p>the whole run of the evidence brought out on the two trials.
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, in his confession, which he had gotten up to be used in his
</p>
<p>defence, claims that he was a member of a conspiracy to kidnap
</p>
<p>the President, and carry him to Richmond. John H. Surratt, in
</p>
<p>his Rockville lecture, claims the same thing. They both claim
</p>
<p>that when Booth laid aside this plan as impracticable, and proposed
</p>
<p>to change it to a conspiracy to assassinate, that they withdrew,
</p>
<p>and would have nothing further to do with it. It is evident that
</p>
<p>the statements of both are false, both as regards the original purpose
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy, and also their abandonment of it. Surratt in
</p>
<p>his confessions to McMillen stated that he received a letter from
</p>
<p>Booth in Montreal on the loth of April. This letter was written
</p>
<p>from New York, and summoned him to Washington at once, as it
</p>
<p>had become necessary for them to change their plans and to act
</p>
<p>quickly.
</p>
<p>He left Montreal in obedience to this summons on the I2th of
</p>
<p>April, and was in Elmira on the morning of the I3th. In his
</p>
<p>defense of an alibi, he tried to prove that he remained at Elmira
</p>
<p>until after the I5th, and then returned to Montreal, where he arrived
</p>
<p>on the 1 8th.
</p>
<p>His counsel argued that the plan up to that time had been tc

</p>
<p>capture, and that it was then for the first time that Booth had de-
</p>
<p>termined to assassinate ; that this was the change of plan referred
</p>
<p>to in his letter, and that, as Surratt, according to their plea, never

<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 309
</p>
<p>saw him after this change of plan had been determined upon, he
</p>
<p>knew nothing about it, and was never a member of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>to assassinate. He admitted that he left Montreal in response to
</p>
<p>Booth's letter, but claimed that he did not go any further than
</p>
<p>Elmira, in his defense.
</p>
<p>This, also, is his story in his Rockville lecture, in which he admits
</p>
<p>that he was a member of the conspiracy to capture the President,
</p>
<p>but asserts that he was never a member of the conspiracy to assas-
</p>
<p>sinate him. Why did he obey Booth's summons which required
</p>
<p>him to come at once to Washington ? Why did he come by way of
</p>
<p>Elmira? He says in his lecture that he went to Elmira in the
</p>
<p>interest of a plan to liberate the rebel prisoners that were held at
</p>
<p>that place. He had just been to Richmond, carrying dispatches
</p>
<p>from Davis and Benjamin to their agents in Canada. Active meas-
</p>
<p>ures were at once resorted to to accomplish the assassinations that
</p>
<p>had been planned without delay, and had the scheme been fully
</p>
<p>realized it was no doubt a part of this plan to bring into active
</p>
<p>service at once all the secret treasonable military organizations
</p>
<p>throughout the North, liberate all the rebel prisoners held in North-
</p>
<p>ern prisons, and inaugurate a new rebellion in the North, in aid of
</p>
<p>the existing rebellion in the South. Surratt admits that he went
</p>
<p>to Elmira on this business. He went there no doubt to arrange
</p>
<p>with other conspirators there for carrying out this purpose when
</p>
<p>notified of the success of the assassination plot. No doubt similar
</p>
<p>arrangements had been made at Chicago to liberate the prisoners
</p>
<p>at Camp Douglass ; and perhaps at other places. The partial fail-
</p>
<p>ure of the assassination plot, and the signal triumph of our arms,
</p>
<p>admonished these Northern traitors that they had better not enter
</p>
<p>the arena of actual war, and frustrated all the plans of Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis and his Canada Cabinet. Surratt's admissions are right in
</p>
<p>the line of our theory, and tend to prove its correctness ; but his
</p>
<p>claim that he was only a member of a conspiracy to capture is mani-
</p>
<p>festly untrue. Let us hear the conclusion of that eminent jurist,
</p>
<p>Judge Pierrepont, founded on a careful consideration of all the evi-

<p>dence on this point. " Now you see gentlemen, what is meant by
</p>
<p>a change of plan. In the spring of 1864 the plan was to murder
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln. They laid various plans for its accomplishment.
</p>
<p>3IO ASSASSINATION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>They thought to do it as he went to the Soldiers' Home, by the
</p>
<p>telescopic rifle, and they did not intend, in the event of concluding to
</p>
<p>carry out that plan, to let his wife or his child stand in their way.
</p>
<p>They then thought to do it by having Payne call upon Mr. Lincoln,
</p>
<p>get into conversation with him, listen to his stories, seem to be inter-
</p>
<p>ested in them, and then, at that moment, to strike the knife home,
</p>
<p>deep into his heart. They at another time thought to poison him,
</p>
<p>and for this purpose tried the cup ; but it seemed that that failed
</p>
<p>them once, and, as Booth said, might fail them again. They finally
</p>
<p>concluded they would try to kill him in the theatre, instead of on
</p>
<p>his way to the Soldiers' Home, and have Payne kill Secretary
</p>
<p>Seward at his house. That plan they carried out. But, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, notwithstanding this change of plan, never was there for more
</p>
<p>than a year any other purpose than to murder. They had long
</p>
<p>since abandoned the idea of kidnapping, for that required too much
</p>
<p>machinery, too many men, and subjected them to too much
</p>
<p>danger; and the changes in plan that had taken place recently were
</p>
<p>simply as to the mode of killing, and the men who should strike the
</p>
<p>fatal blow." Here we have the mature opinion of an eminent jurist,
</p>
<p>founded on a thorough and careful examination of all the evidence,
</p>
<p>and we feel confident that no candid, intelligent man who studies
</p>
<p>all the evidence with care can come to any other.
</p>
<p>Having had occasion to follow the history of this sad affair from
</p>
<p>its incipiency to its conclusion, as revealed by the evidence pro-
</p>
<p>duced before the commission, and that brought out on the civil
</p>
<p>trial, my purpose in writing this book has been fulfilled. It was,
</p>
<p>first, to correct many grave errors in public opinion that have
</p>
<p>grown out of a wilful and ingenious suppression of the truth and
</p>
<p>an unblushing publication of falsehoods, in order to cover up from
</p>
<p>view the fact that the assassination of President Lincoln was the
</p>
<p>result of a deep-laid political scheme to subvert the government
</p>
<p>of the United States in aid of the rebellion ; that it was not
</p>
<p>merely the rash act of Booth and his co-conspirators, to whom
</p>
<p>the work was intrusted ; but that behind these stood Jefferson

<p>conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The second object of the author was to vindicate the govern-

</p>
<p>ment in its method of dealing with the assassins, and to show that
</p>
<p>the decisions of the commission were founded on adequate testi-
</p>
<p>mony. And, lastly, to so gather up and present the truth, as shown
</p>
<p>by the evidence, that his work might be of some service to the
</p>
<p>future historian. He feels that he has kept faithful to his purpose
</p>
<p>to present nothing but the truth. He feels that by this he has not
</p>
<p>only vindicated the government, but that also in doing this he has
</p>
<p>vindicated the commission. He has shown that a military com-
</p>
<p>mission was the only tribunal before which the conspirators and
</p>
<p>assassins could properly be tried ; that the right of the government
</p>
<p>to try offenses of this character is a power inherent in sovereignty
</p>
<p>as is the right of personal self-defence a right that inheres to the
</p>
<p>individual ; that the laws of war recognize this right and justify its
</p>
<p>exercise. The wisdom of the government in dealing thus sum-
</p>
<p>marily with these offenders was seen in its effect on the Canada
</p>
<p>conspirators, who at first were swearing that " they were not done
</p>
<p>yet," but who were driven to their holes by the prompt and wise
</p>
<p>action of the government in dealing thus summarily with their
</p>
<p>hired assassins as fast as they were caught. The government thus
</p>
<p>compelled its enemies to respect its authority.
</p>
<p>And, finally, the result of the trial of one of the conspirators
</p>
<p>before a civil court, more than anything else, vindicates its wisdom
</p>
<p>in sending these prisoners before a military tribunal for trial.

<p>John Matthews gives us the substance of a paper put into his

<p>hands by Booth on the afternoon of the assassination, which closed
</p>
<p>as follows: "Men who love their country better than their lives
</p>
<p>Booth, Payne, Atzerodt, and Herold." ' It will be observed that
</p>
<p>Booth here identifies Atzerodt with the conspiracy and the evi-
</p>
<p>dence shows that he relied on Atzerodt at that time to perform
</p>
<p>the part he assigned to him : to assassinate Vice- President Johnson.
</p>
<p>He had transferred Atzerodt from the Pennsylvania House, where
</p>
<p>he had been boarding, to the Kirkwood House on the morning of
</p>
<p>that day, having engaged his room but for one day, and paying for

</p>
<p>it in advance. This change was made because the Vice-President
</p>
<p>was stopping at the Kirkwood.
</p>
<p>That Booth had visited Atzerodt at his room during the day was
</p>
<p>shown by the fact that his coat, containing his bank book and
</p>
<p>handkerchiefs marked in his name, was found in Atzerodt's room
</p>
<p>where he had hung it up and then forgotten to take it again when
</p>
<p>he left. That the purpose was a murderous purpose was shown by
</p>
<p>the fact that a pistol, loaded and capped, together with a large
</p>
<p>dagger, were found hid away in the bed. Booth had been there
</p>
<p>schooling Atzerodt in his part, and had had such assurances from
</p>
<p>Atzerodt that he felt safe in coupling his name with his own and

<p>those of Payne and Herold in the paper referred to. Matthews

<p>stated that whilst he was in conversation with Booth, General Grant
</p>
<p>passed rapidly down the Avenue in an open carriage, having his
</p>
<p>baggage along with him ; that he called Booth's attention to this
</p>
<p>fact, when Booth left him abruptly and galloped down the avenue
</p>
<p>after General Grant. Why did he do this ? What did this mean ?
</p>
<p>When Atzerodt had made his way into the country, and was eating
</p>
<p>his dinner on Sabbath, the i6th, at the house of Hezekiah Metz, he
</p>
<p>was asked if it was true, as had been reported, that General Grant
</p>
<p>had been killed, answered, " If the man who was to follow him had
</p>
<p>done so, it was likely to be true. " This explains Booth's purpose
</p>
<p>in galloping after General Grant when he saw that he was about to
</p>
<p>leave the city. He hurried to inform O'Laughlin of the fact and
</p>
<p>to have him follow the General and assassinate him on the road or
</p>
<p>at the end of his journey, and had told Atzerodt of this arrange-
</p>
<p>ment. We can in this way account for the fact that Atzerodt knew
</p>
<p>that a man had had orders to follow him. The fact that Booth, in
</p>
<p>the paper referred to, coupled Atzerodt's name with his own and
</p>
<p>those of Payne and Herold as " men who loved their country better
</p>
<p>than their lives" shows that he fully expected Atzerodt to perform
</p>
<p>the part he had assigned him in the tragedy. O'Laughlin was no
</p>
<p>doubt the man who had orders to follow the General, but upon
</p>
<p>reflection, wisely declined to do so.

<p>Dr. Mudd voluntarily confessed to Captain Button, who had
</p>
<p>charge of the convicts who were sent to the Dry Tortugas, whilst
</p>
<p>on their voyage thither, that he knew Booth when he came to his
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF WITNESSES BY THE DEFENSE. 313
</p>
<p>house on the morning of the I5th of April; and said that he
</p>
<p>denied it because he was afraid of endangering his own life, and
</p>
<p>the lives of his family. He also admitted that he went to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington by appointment to introduce Booth to Surratt, and that
</p>
<p>Wiechmann's testimony on this point was true. Why, if innocent,
</p>
<p>should he have been afraid to let it be known that Booth and
</p>
<p>Herold called at his house on that morning, and what he had done
</p>
<p>for them ? This fear could only have come from a consciousness
</p>
<p>of guilt, and shows that he not only knew what they had done, but,
</p>
<p>also, that he was implicated in theinguilt by his previous knowledge
</p>
<p>of what they were going to do. John H. Surratt, after he had
</p>
<p>been set at liberty, delivered a lecture at Rockville, Maryland, in
</p>
<p>which he denied that he ever knew of the plot to assassinate, but
</p>
<p>admitted that he was a member of a conspiracy to capture Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Lincoln and carry him a prisoner to Richmond. He asserts
</p>
<p>that this was Booth's purpose whilst he was co-operating with him,
</p>
<p>and that they had spent a great deal of money ($10,000) in
</p>
<p>preparations to effect their object. He claims that neither the
</p>
<p>Richmond government, nor its agents in Canada, knew anything
</p>
<p>about their scheme, and that they alone were responsible for it.
</p>
<p>Where then did they get their $10,000 to spend on it? They
</p>
<p>were both without means of their own, and without employment.
</p>
<p>The Rockville lecture is simply a plausible tissue of falsehoods,
</p>
<p>well put together, but altogether inconsistant with the whole tenure
</p>
<p>of the evidence in the case. It is contradicted at almost every
</p>
<p>point by the testimony we have had under review. Yet its admis-
</p>
<p>sions are important, as they establish the theory of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>which we have maintained. He admits that he was engaged in
</p>
<p>the secret service of the Confederate government almost constantly
</p>
<p>from the time he left college in the summer of 1861, and that he
</p>
<p>enjoyed that service greatly, and was very active in it. He claims
</p>
<p>that he was entrusted with dispatches for the agents of that govern-
</p>
<p>ment in Canada, and that he passed from the one place to the
</p>
<p>other frequently. He admits that he reached Montreal on the 6th

</p>
<p>of April with dispatches from Davis and Benjamin to Thompson.
</p>
<p>Of course he does not say that he also carried Bills of Exchange
</p>
<p>on Liverpool at the same time for $70,000, or that he carried
</p>
<p>3 1 4 ASSASSINA TION OF LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>funds at any time ; but we have had the proof of this fact. He
</p>
<p>admits that he went from Montreal on the I2th of April, to Elmira,
</p>
<p>New York, and claims that he remained there until after the assas-
</p>
<p>sination.
</p>
<p>This we have seen was proven to be a falsehood, yet his purpose
</p>
<p>in going to Elmira, as claimed by himself, confirms our theory that
</p>
<p>the plan of the conspirators was in connection with the assassina-
</p>
<p>tions which they had planned to get up a Northern rebellion in aid
</p>
<p>of that of the South, through the agency of the secret disloyal
</p>
<p>organizations with whom they were in correspondence throughout
</p>
<p>the Northwestern and Middle States, and to liberate all the rebel
</p>
<p>prisoners held in Northern prisons to augment their forces, and in
</p>
<p>the state of anarchy and confusion, consequent upon the depriva-
</p>
<p>tion of the government of a civil head, and the army of a lawful
</p>
<p>commander, they thus intended inaugurating a reign of terror
</p>
<p>throughout the North that would ma*ke a further prosecution of the
</p>
<p>war impossible, and by this means establish the Southern Confed-
</p>
<p>eracy. Surratt says in his lecture that he went to Elmira for the
</p>
<p>purpose of preparing for the release of the more than five thousand
</p>
<p>rebel prisoners that were held at that place. The author, after a
</p>
<p>very careful scrutiny of all the evidence relating to the question of
</p>
<p>Surratt's presence in Washington on the night of the assassination,
</p>
<p>and of his participation in it, has not hesitated to express the
</p>
<p>opinion that this was proven. By all legal rules the plea of an
</p>
<p>alibi failed as the vast preponderance of evidence went to prove
</p>
<p>his presence as charged. But even if we admit that he was at
</p>
<p>Elmira, as claimed, on the night of the assassination, and that he
</p>
<p>remained there until the i6th of April, he is not by this admission
</p>
<p>disconnected with the conspiracy, but was by his own admission
</p>
<p>acting there in the interest of its purposes by setting at large the
</p>
<p>five thousand rebel prisoners held there by the government. The
</p>
<p>effort to aid the rebellion by this step was contingent upon the
</p>
<p>accomplishment of all of the assassinations that had been planned.
</p>
<p>The failure to do this rendered his mission there useless. If he

<p>was there, he was there in the interest of the conspiracy. That he
</p>
<p>had all of its guilt upon his conscience is shown by the facts of his
</p>
<p>flight and concealment.

</p>
<p>Thompson and his gang claimed, in the fall of 1864, it will be
</p>
<p>remembered, that they had eight hundred men hid away in Chicago
</p>
<p>for the purpose of liberating the rebel prisoners held in Camp Doug-
</p>
<p>lass. They were only waiting for a safe opportunity, for which they
</p>
<p>were planning to secure an opportune moment. Why did Vallan-
</p>
<p>digham break his parole in the summer of 1864 and return to
</p>
<p>Ohio to become a candidate for the governorship of that state? It
</p>
<p>was no doubt in the interest of this new rebellion that had been
</p>
<p>planned, and that he might be in a position to carry out the details
</p>
<p>of these nefarious schemes. It will be remembered that he had
</p>
<p>been elected Supreme Commander of the order of American Knights
</p>
<p>at their annual meeting in February, 1863. During Vallan-
</p>
<p>digham's enforced absence, Robert Holloway acted as Lieutenant-
</p>
<p>General, or Deputy Supreme Commander, and Doctor Massey of
</p>
<p>Ohio was Secretary of State. The organization was a military one,
</p>
<p>of which Vallandigham was recognized as General, and had a
</p>
<p>complete army organization, and was, in 1 864, arming, drilling, and
</p>
<p>preparing for a Northern rebellion, and the accomplishment of the
</p>
<p>assassinations that were planned and arranged for was no doubt to
</p>
<p>have been the signal for a general uprising. It may be asked,
</p>
<p>why, if this theory be correct, was not this purpose carried out?
</p>
<p>We answer simply because that God who planted, and has hitherto
</p>
<p>watched over our nation, frustrated the scheme. He so ordered
</p>
<p>the events of his providence that the carrying out of this wicked
</p>
<p>scheme became manifestly impossible. The plan to deprive the
</p>
<p>government of a civil head and the army of a lawful commander
</p>
<p>failed. The collapse of the rebellion was precipitated so rapidly
</p>
<p>that it was manifestly useless to attempt to give it aid. The valor,
</p>
<p>prowess, skill, and loyalty of our victorious legions was a menace to
</p>
<p>copperheadism. This secret army concluded that discretion was
</p>
<p>the better part of valor, and sought safely in seclusion, but not quite
</p>
<p>in silence. They still continued to hiss.
</p>
<p>To God's over-ruling and protecting care we owe our thanks for
</p>
<p>the preservation of our government, and for the peace and prosperity

<p>PREFACE TO APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>IN presenting the great argument of the Hon. John A. Bingham, Assistant Judge-
</p>
<p>Advocate, on the trial of the assassins, the author feels that he does not need to offer
</p>
<p>an apology to his readers, notwithstanding its length.
</p>
<p>In addition to what he has already said by way of commending it to the careful
</p>
<p>perusal of his readers, he will add by way of preface, the following extracts from Barnes's
</p>
<p>4Oth Congress, Vol. i, showing the light in which that great effort was viewed by
</p>
<p>competent judges at the time; and also giving extracts from his great argument before
</p>
<p>the United States Senate on the articles of impeachment found against Andrew Johnson,
</p>
<p>President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors, in vindication of the
</p>
<p>high encomiums bestowed by him on this distinguished statesman and advocate.
</p>
<p>EXTRACTS FROM "THE; FORTIETH CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES."
</p>
<p>BY WILLIAM H. BARNES: IST VOL., 4OTH CONGRESS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bingham served as Special Judge Advocate in the great trial of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>who were tried for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, etc. Immense labor devolved
</p>
<p>upon him during this difficult and protracted trial, and for eight weeks his arduous duties
</p>
<p>allowed him but brief intervals of rest. He occupied nine hours in the delivery of the
</p>
<p>closing arguments, in which he ably elucidated the law and the testimony in the case,
</p>
<p>and conclusively proved the guilt of the conspirators. Mr. Bingham's success in this
</p>
<p>great trial attracted general attention, and awakened a wide-spread curiosity to know
</p>
<p>his history. Soon after the close of the trial, a correspondent of the Philadelphia Press,
</p>
<p>having expressed the deep interest he had felt in arriving at a well founded conclusion
</p>
<p>as to "the guilt of the conspirators and the constitutionality of the court," wrote as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>" Grant me space in your columns to give expression to my most unqualified admira-
</p>
<p>tion of the great arguments, on these two main points, presented to the court by the
</p>
<p>Special Judge Advocate, Gen. John A. Bingham. In the entire range of my reading, I
</p>
<p>have known of no productions that have so literally led me captive. For careful analysis,
</p>
<p>logical argumentation, profound and most extensive research; for overwhelming
</p>
<p>unravelment of complications that would have involved an ordinary mind only with
</p>
<p>inextricable bewilderment, and for a literal rending to tatters of all the metaphysical
</p>
<p>subleties of the array of legal talent engaged on the other side, I know of no two pro-
</p>
<p>ductions in the English language superior to these. They are literally as the spear of
</p>
<p>Ithuriel, dissolving the hardest substances at their touch; as the thread of Dsedalus,
</p>
<p>leading out of the labyrinths of error, no matter how thick and mazy. Not Locke or

<p>Bacon were more profound; not Daniel Webster was clearer and more penetrating; not
</p>
<p>Chillingworth was more logical. I feel sure that the author of these two unrivalled
</p>
<p>papers must possess a legal mind unrivalled in America, and must be, too, one of our
</p>
<p>rising statesmen. But who is John A. Bingham, who by his industry and learning dis-
</p>
<p>319
</p>
<p>320 PREFACE TO APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>played on this wonderful trial, has placed the country under such a heavy debt of
</p>
<p>obligation? He may be well known to others moving in a public sphere, like yourself,
</p>
<p>but to me, so absorbed in a different line of duty, he has appeared so suddenly, and
</p>
<p>yet with such vividness, that I long to know some, at least, of his antecedents."
</p>
<p>Upon which the editor remarked:
</p>
<p>" The question of our esteemed correspondent is natural to one who has not, probably,
</p>
<p>watched the individual actors on the great stage of public affairs with the interest of the
</p>
<p>historical and political student. We are not surprised that the arguments of Mr. Bing-
</p>
<p>ham before the military commission should have rilled him with delight. It was worthy
</p>
<p>of the great subject confided to that accomplished statesman by the Government, and
</p>
<p>of his own fame. When the assassins of Mr. Lincoln were sent for trial before the
</p>
<p>military court by President Johnson, the Government wisely left the whole management
</p>
<p>to Judge Holt and his eloquent associate, Mr. Bingham, and to the latter was committed
</p>
<p>the stupendous labor of sifting the mass of evidence, of replying to the corps of lawyers
</p>
<p>for the defence, of setting forth the guilt of the accused and of vindicating the policy
</p>
<p>and the duty of the executive in an exigency so novel and so full of tragic solemnity.
</p>
<p>The crime was so enormous, and the trial of those who committed it so important in all
</p>
<p>its issues, immediate, contingent and remote, as to awaken an excitement that embraced
</p>
<p>all nations. The murder itself was almost forgotten by those who wished to screen the
</p>
<p>murderers, and the most wicked theories were broached and sown broadcast by men,
</p>
<p>who, under cloak of reverence for what they called the law, toiled with herculean energy
</p>
<p>to weaken the arm of the Government, extended in time of war to save the servants of
</p>
<p>the people from being slaughtered by assassins in public places, and tracked even to
</p>
<p>their firesides by the agents and friends of slavery. These poisons of plausibility,
</p>
<p>blunting the sharpest horrors of any age, and sanctifying the most hellish offenses,
</p>
<p>required an antidote as swift to cure. Mr. Bingham's two great arguments, alluded
</p>
<p>to by our correspondent, have supplied the remedy. They are monuments of reflection,
</p>
<p>research, and argumentation; and they are presented in the language of a scholar and
</p>
<p>with the fervor of an orator. In the great volume of proof and counter-proof, rhetoric,
</p>
<p>and controversy that forever preserves the record of this great trial, the efforts of
</p>
<p>Mr. Bingham will ever remain to be first studied with an eager and admiring interest.
</p>
<p>That they came, after all that has and can be said against the Government, is rather
</p>
<p>an inducement to their more satisfactory and critical consideration. For from that
</p>
<p>study the American student and citizen must, more than ever, realize how irresistible is

</p>
<p>Truth when in conflict with Falsehood, and how poor and puerile are all the professional
</p>
<p>tricks of the lawyer when opposed to the moral power of the patriot."
</p>
<p>In Congress Mr. Bingham has had a distinguished career, marked by important ser-
</p>
<p>vices to the country. In the XXXVIIth Congress he was earnest and successful in
</p>
<p>advocating many important measures to promote the vigorous prosecution of the war,
</p>
<p>which had just begun. Returning to Congress in 1865, after an absence of two years,
</p>
<p>he at once took a prominent position. Upon the formation of the joint committee on
</p>
<p>Reconstruction, December I4th, 1865, he was appointed one of the nine members on the
</p>
<p>part of the House. He was active in advocating the great measures of Reconstruction,
</p>
<p>which were proposed and passed in the XXXIXth and XLth Congresses. The House
</p>
<p>of Representatives having resolved that Andrew Johnson should be impeached for
</p>
<p>"high crimes and misdemeanors," Mr. Bingham was appointed on the committee to
</p>
<p>which was intrusted the important duty of drawing up the Articles of Impeachment.
</p>
<p>This work having been done to the satisfaction of the House, Mr. Bingham was elected
</p>
<p>chairman of the managers to conduct the impeachment of the President before the
</p>
<p>Senate.
</p>
<p>On him devolved the duty of making the closing argument. His speech on this
</p>
<p>occasion ranks among the greatest forensic efforts of any age. He began the delivery
</p>
<p>of his argument on Monday, May 4th, and occupied the attention of the Senate, and a
</p>
<p>PREFACE TO APPENDIX. 321
</p>
<p>vast auditory on the floor and in the galleries, during three successive days. At the
</p>
<p>close of his argument, the immense audience in the galleries, wrought up to the highest
</p>
<p>pitch of enthusiasm, gave vent to such an unanimous and continued outburst of applause
</p>
<p>as has never before been heard in the Capitol. Ladies and gentlemen, who could not
</p>
<p>have been induced deliberately to trespass on the decorum of the Senate, by whose
</p>
<p>courtesy they were admitted to the galleries, overcome by their feelings, joined in the
</p>
<p>utterance of applause, knowing that for so doing the Sergeant-at-arms would be required
</p>
<p>to expel them from the galleries. The history of the country records no similar tribute
</p>
<p>to the oratorial efforts of the ablest advocates or statesmen. From so long and so well-
</p>
<p>sustained an argument, it is impossible to select particular passages which would give
</p>
<p>an adequate idea of the whole. The following historical argument for the supremacy of
</p>
<p>the law will always be read with interest, whether as an extract, or in its original
</p>
<p>setting:
</p>
<p>"Is it not in' vain, I ask you, Senators, that the people have thus vindicated by
</p>
<p>battle the supremacy of their own Constitution and laws, if, after all, their President is
</p>
<p>permitted to suspend their laws and dispense with the execution thereof at pleasure, and
</p>
<p>defy the power of the people to bring him to trial and judgment before the only tribunal
</p>
<p>authorized by the Constitution to try him ? That is the issue that is presented before
</p>
<p>the Senate for decision by these articles of impeachment. By such acts of usurpation
</p>
<p>on the part of the ruler of a people, I need not say to the Senate, the peace of nations
</p>
<p>is broken, as it is only by obedience to law that the peace of nations is maintained, and
</p>
<p>their existence perpetuated. Law is the voice of God and the harmony of the world:
</p>
<p>" ' It doth preserve the stars from wrong,
</p>
<p>Through it the eternal heavens are fresh and strong.'
</p>
<p>"All history is but philosophy, teaching by example. God is in history, and through it
</p>
<p>teaches to men and nations the profoundest lessons which they learn. It does not sur-
</p>
<p>prise me, Senators, that the learned counsel for the accused asked the Senate, in the
</p>
<p>consideration of this question, to close that volume of instruction, not to look into the
</p>
<p>past, and not to listen to its voices. Senators, from that day when the inscription was
</p>
<p>written upon the graves of the heroes of Thermopylse, ' Stranger, go tell the Lacede-
</p>
<p>monians that we lie here in obedience to their laws,' to this hour, no profounder lesson
</p>
<p>than this has come down to us: that through obedience to law comes the strength of
</p>
<p>nations and the safety of men.
</p>
<p>"No more fatal provision ever found its way into the Constitutions of States than

</p>
<p>that contended for in this defense which recognizes the right of a single despot or of
</p>
<p>the many to discriminate in the administration of justice between the ruler and the
</p>
<p>citizen, between the strong and the weak. It was by this unjust discrimination that
</p>
<p>Aristides was banished because he was just. It was by this unjust discrimination that
</p>
<p>Socrates, the wonder of the Pagan world, was doomed to drink the hemlock because of
</p>
<p>his transcendant virtues. It was in honorable protest against this unjust discrimination
</p>
<p>that the great Roman Senator, father of his country, declared that the force of the law
</p>
<p>consists in its being made for the whole community. Senators, it is the pride and
</p>
<p>boast of that great people from whom we are descended, as it is the pride and boast of
</p>
<p>every American, that the law is the supreme power of the State, that it is for the protection
</p>
<p>of each, by the combined power of all. By the Constitution of England the hereditary
</p>
<p>monarch is no more above the law than the humblest subject; and by the Constitution

<p>upon the people of England, and finally cost the usurper his life. The subsequent
</p>
<p>usurpations of James II., and I only refer to it because there is between his official
</p>
<p>conduct and that of this accused President, the most remarkable parallel that I have ever
</p>
<p>read in history, filled the heart -and brain of England with conviction that new
</p>
<p>securities must be taken to restrain the prerogatives asserted by the crown, if they
</p>
<p>would maintain their ancient Constitution and perpetuate their liberties. It is well
</p>
<p>said by Hallam that the usurpations of James swept away the solemn ordinances of the
</p>
<p>legislature. Out of those usurpations came the great revolution of 1688, which resulted
</p>
<p>in the dethronement and banishment of James, in the elevation of William and Mary,
</p>
<p>and in the immortal Declaration of Rights.
</p>
<p>" I ask the Senate to notice that these charges against James are substantially the
</p>
<p>charges presented against this accused President, and confessed here of record, that he
</p>
<p>has suspended the laws, and dispensed with the execution of laws, and in order to do
</p>
<p>this has usurped authority as the executive of the nation, declaring himself entitled under
</p>
<p>the Constitution to suspend the laws and dispense with their execution. He has further,
</p>
<p>like James, attempted to control the appropriated money of the people contrary to law.
</p>
<p>And he has further, like James, although it is not alleged against him in the Articles of
</p>
<p>Impeachment, it is confessed in his answer, and attempted to cause the question of his
</p>
<p>responsibility to the people to be tried, not in the King's Bench, but in the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court, when that question is alone cognizable in the Senate of the United States.
</p>
<p>Surely, Senators, if these usurpations, if these endeavors on the part of James thus to
</p>
<p>subvert the liberties of the people of England, cost him his crown and kingdom, the
</p>
<p>like offenses committed by Andrew Johnson ought to cost him his office, and to subject
</p>
<p>him to that perpetual disability pronounced by the people through the Constitution upon
</p>
<p>him for his high crimes and misdemeanors.
</p>
<p>" I ask you, Senators, how long men would deliberate upon the question whether a
</p>
<p>private citizen arraigned at the bar of one of your tribunals of justice for a criminal vio-
</p>
<p>lation of the law, should be permitted to interpose a plea in justification of his criminal
</p>
<p>act, that his only purpose was to interpret the Constitution and laws for himself, that
</p>
<p>he violated the law in the exercise of his prerogative to ,test its validity hereafter at
</p>
<p>such a day as might suit his own convenience in the courts of justice. Surely it is as
</p>
<p>competent for the private citizen to interpose such justification in answer to crime in
</p>
<p>one of your tribunals of justice, as it is for the President to interpose it, and for the

</p>
<p>simple reason that the Constitution is no respecter of persons, and rests neither in the
</p>
<p>private citizen judicial power.
</p>
<p>" Can it be that by your decree you are at last to make this discrimination between
</p>
<p>the ruler of the people and the private citizen, and to allow him to interpose his assumed
</p>
<p>right to interpret judicially your Constitution and laws ? Are you to solemnly proclaim
</p>
<p>by your decree :
</p>
<p>" ' Plate sin with gold,
</p>
<p>And the strong lance of justice heartless breaks;
</p>
<p>Arm it in rags and a pigmy's straw doth pierce it? '
</p>
<p>" I put away the possibility that the Senate of the United States, equal in dignity to
</p>
<p>any tribunal in the world, is capable of recording any such decision even upon the peti-
</p>
<p>tion and prayer of the accused and guilty President. Can it be that by reason of his
</p>
<p>great office the President is to be protected in his high crimes and misdemeanors, viola-

</p>
<p>tive alike of his oath, of the Constitution and of the express letter of your written law,
</p>
<p>enacted by the legislative department of the government?
</p>
<p>" I ask you, Senators, to consider that I speak before you this day in behalf of the
</p>
<p>violated law of a free people, who commission me. I ask you to remember this, that I
</p>
<p>speak this day under the obligations of this my oath. I ask you to consider that I am
</p>
<p>not insensible to the significance of the words of which mention was made by the
</p>
<p>learned counsel from New York; justice, duty, law, oath. I ask you to remember
</p>
<p>that the great principles of constitutional liberty for which I speak this day, have been
</p>
<p>taught to men and nations by all the trials and triumphs, by all the agonies and martyr-
</p>
<p>doms of the past; that they are the wisdom of the centuries uttered by the elect of the
</p>
<p>human race.
</p>
<p>" I ask you to consider that we stand this day pleading for the violated majesty of
</p>
<p>the law, by the graves of half a million of martyred hero-patriots who sacrificed them-
</p>
<p>selves for their country, the Constitution, and the laws, and who by their sublime exam-
</p>
<p>ples have taught us that all must obey the law; that none are above the law; that no
</p>
<p>man lives for himself alone, but each for all, that some must die that the State may
</p>
<p>live; that the citizen is but for to-day, that the commonwealth is for all time, and that

<p>ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. BINGHAM,
</p>
<p>SPECIAL JUDGE ADVOCATE,
</p>
<p>IN REPLY TO THE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS IN DEFENCE OF MARY
</p>
<p>E. SURRATT AND OTHERS, CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY AND
</p>
<p>THE MURDER OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, LATE PRESIDENT
</p>
<p>OF THE UNITED STATES, ETC.
</p>
<p>MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT : The conspiracy here charged and specified, and the
</p>
<p>acts alleged to have been committed in pursuance thereof, and with the intent laid,
</p>
<p>constitute a crime the atrocity of which has sent a shudder through the civilized world.
</p>
<p>All that was agreed upon and attempted by the alleged inciters and instigators of this
</p>
<p>crime constitutes a combination of atrocities with scarcely a parallel in the annals of the
</p>
<p>human race. Whether the prisoners at your bar are guilty of the conspiracy and the
</p>
<p>acts alleged to have been done in pursuance thereof, as set forth in the charge and speci-
</p>
<p>fication, is a question the determination of -which rests splely with this honorable court,
</p>
<p>and in passing upon which this court are the sole judges of the law and the fact.
</p>
<p>In presenting my views upon the questions of law raised by the several counsel for
</p>
<p>the defence, and also on the testimony adduced for and against the accused, I desire to
</p>
<p>be just to them, just to you, just to my country, and just to my own convictions. The
</p>
<p>issue joined involves the highest interests of the accused, and, in my judgment, the
</p>
<p>highest interests of the whole people of the United States.
</p>
<p>It is a matter of great moment to all the people of this country that the prisoners at
</p>
<p>your bar be lawfully tried and lawfully convicted or acquitted. A wrongful and illegal
</p>
<p>conviction or a wrongful and illegal acquittal upon this dread issue would impair some-
</p>
<p>what the security of every man's life, and shake the stability of the republic.
</p>
<p>The crime charged and specified upon your record is not simply the crime of murder-
</p>
<p>ing a human being, but it is the crime of killing and murdering on the I4th day of April,
</p>
<p>A. D. 1865, within the military department of Washington and the intrenched lines
</p>
<p>thereof, Abraham Lincoln, then President of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief
</p>
<p>of the army and navy thereof; and then and there assaulting, with intent to kill and
</p>
<p>murder, William H. Seward, then Secretary of State of the United States; and then
</p>
<p>and there lying in wait to kill and murder Andrew Johnson, then Vice-President of the
</p>
<p>United States, and Ulysses S. Grant, then lieutenant-general and in command of the
</p>
<p>armies of the United States, in pursuance of a treasonable conspiracy entered into by
</p>
<p>the accused with one John Wilkes Booth, and John H. Surratt, upon the instigation of
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, Jacob Thompson, and George N. Sanders and others, with intent

</p>
<p>thereby to aid the existing rebellion and subvert the Constitution and laws of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>325
</p>
<p>326 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>The rebellion, in aid of which this conspiracy was formed and this great public crime
</p>
<p>committed, was prosecuted for the vindication of no right, for the redress of no wrong,
</p>
<p>but was itself simply a criminal conspiracy and gigantic assassination. In resisting and
</p>
<p>crushing this rebellion the American people take no step backward and cast no reproach
</p>
<p>upon their past history. That people now, as ever, proclaim the self-evident truth that
</p>
<p>whenever government becomes subversive of the ends of its creation, it is the right and
</p>
<p>duty of the people to alter or abolish it; but during these four years of conflict they have
</p>
<p>as clearly proclaimed, as was their right and duty, both by law and by arms, that the
</p>
<p>government of their own choice, humanely and wisely administered, oppressive of none
</p>
<p>and just to all, shall not be overthrown by privy conspiracy or armed rebellion.
</p>
<p>What wrong had this government or any of its duly constituted agents done to any
</p>
<p>of the guilty actors in this atrocious rebellion? They themselves being witnesses, the
</p>
<p>government which they assailed had done no act, and attempted no act, injurious to
</p>
<p>them, or in any sense violative of their rights as citizens and men; and yet for four
</p>
<p>years, without cause of complaint or colorable excuse, the inciters and instigators of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy charged upon your record have, by armed rebellion, resisted the lawful author-
</p>
<p>ity of the government, and attempted by force of arms to blot the republic from the
</p>
<p>map of nations. Now that their battalions of treason are broken and flying before the
</p>
<p>victorious legions of the republic, the chief traitors in this great crime against your
</p>
<p>government secretly conspire with their hired confederates to achieve by assassination,
</p>
<p>if possible, what they have in vain attempted by wager of battle the overthrow of the
</p>
<p>government of the United States and the subversion of its Constitution and laws. It is
</p>
<p>for this secret conspiracy in the interest of the rebellion, formed at the instigation of the
</p>
<p>chiefs in that rebellion, and in pursuance of which the acts charged and specified are
</p>
<p>alleged to have been done and with the intent laid, that the accused are upon trial.
</p>
<p>The government, in preferring this charge, does not indict the whole people of any
</p>
<p>State or section, but only the alleged parties to this unnatural and atrocious conspiracy
</p>
<p>and crime. The President of the United States, in the discharge of his duty as Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief of the army, and by virtue of the power vested in him by the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion and laws of the United States, has constituted you a military court, to hear and
</p>
<p>determine the issue joined against the accused, and has constituted you a court for no
</p>
<p>other purpose whatever. To this charge and specification the defendants have pleaded,
</p>
<p>first, that this court has no jurisdiction in the premises; and, second, not guilty. As
</p>
<p>the court has already overruled the plea to the jurisdiction, it would be passed over in

</p>
<p>silence by me but for the fact that a grave and elaborate argument has been made by
</p>
<p>counsel for the accused not only to show the want of jurisdiction, but to arraign the
</p>
<p>President of the United States before the country and the world as a usurper of power
</p>
<p>over the lives and the liberties of the prisoners. Denying the authority of the President
</p>
<p>to constitute this commission is an averment that this tribunal is not a court of justice,
</p>
<p>has no legal existence, and therefore no power to hear and determine the issue joined.
</p>
<p>The learned counsel for the accused, when they make this averment by way of argument,
</p>
<p>owe it to themselves and to their country to show how the President could otherwise
</p>
<p>lawfully and efficiently discharge the duty enjoined upon him by his oath to protect,
</p>
<p>preserve, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and to take care that the
</p>
<p>laws be faithfully executed.
</p>
<p>An existing rebellion is alleged and not denied. It is charged that in aid of this
</p>
<p>existing rebellion a conspiracy was entered^ into by the accused, incited and instigated
</p>
<p>thereto by the chiefs of this rebellion, to kill and murder the executive officers of the
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 327
</p>
<p>government and the commander of the armies of the United States, and that this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was partly executed by the murder of Abraham Lincoln, and by a murderous
</p>
<p>assault upon the Secretary of State; and counsel reply, by elaborate argument, that
</p>
<p>although the facts be as charged, though the conspirators be numerous and at large, able
</p>
<p>and eager to complete the horrid work of assassination already begun within your mili-
</p>
<p>tary encampment, yet the successor of your murdered President is a usurper if he attempts
</p>
<p>by military force and martial law, as Commander-in-Chief, to prevent the consummation
</p>
<p>of this traitorous conspiracy in aid of this treasonable rebellion. The civil courts, say
</p>
<p>the counsel, are open in the District. I answer, they are closed throughout half the
</p>
<p>republic, and were only open in this District on the day of this confederation and con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, on the day of the traitorous assassination of your President, and are only open
</p>
<p>at this hour by force of the bayonet. Does any man suppose that if the military forces
</p>
<p>which garrison the intrenchments of your capital, fifty thousand strong, were all with-
</p>
<p>drawn, the rebel bands who this day infest the mountain passes in your vicinity would
</p>
<p>allow this court, or any court, to remain open in this District for the trial of these their
</p>
<p>confederates, or would permit your executive officers to discharge the trust committed to
</p>
<p>them, for twenty-four hours?
</p>
<p>At the time this conspiracy was entered into, and when this court was convened and
</p>
<p>entered upon this trial, the country was in a state of civil war. An army of insurrec-
</p>
<p>tionists have, since this trial begun, shed the blood of Union soldiers in battle. The
</p>
<p>conspirator, by whose hand his co-conspirators, whether present or absent, jointly mur-
</p>
<p>dered the President on the I4th of last April, could not be and was not arrested upon
</p>
<p>civil process, but was pursued' by the military power of the government, captured, and
</p>
<p>slain. Was this an act of usurpation? a violation of the right guaranteed to that
</p>
<p>fleeing assassin by the very Constitution against which and for the subversion of which
</p>
<p>he had conspired and murdered the President ? Who in all this land is bold enough or
</p>
<p>base enough to assert it?
</p>
<p>I would be glad to know by what law the President, by a military force, acting only
</p>
<p>upon his military orders, is justified in pursuing, arresting, and killing one of these
</p>
<p>conspirators, and is condemned for arresting in like manner, and by his order subjecting
</p>
<p>to trial, according to the laws of war, any or all of the other parties to this same dam-
</p>
<p>nable conspiracy and crime, by a military tribunal of justice a tribunal, I may be par-
</p>
<p>doned for saying, whose integrity and impartiality are above suspicion, and pass unchal-
</p>
<p>lenged even by the accused themselves.

</p>
<p>The argument against the jurisdiction of this court rests upon the assumption that
</p>
<p>even in time of insurrection and civil war no crimes are cognizable and punishable by
</p>
<p>military commission or court-martial, save crimes committed in the military or naval
</p>
<p>service of the United States, or in the militia of the several states when called into the
</p>
<p>actual service of the United States. But that is not all the argument : it affirms that
</p>
<p>under this plea to the jurisdiction the accused have the right to demand that this court
</p>
<p>shall decide that it is not a judicial tribunal and has no legal existence.
</p>
<p>This is a most extraordinary proposition that the President, under the Constitution
</p>
<p>and laws of the United States, was not only not authorized, but absolutely forbidden, to
</p>
<p>constitute this court for the trial of the accused, and, therefore, the act of the President
</p>
<p>is void, and the gentlemen who compose the tribunal without judicial authority or power,
</p>
<p>and are not in fact or in law a court.
</p>
<p>That I do not misstate what is claimed and attempted to be established on behalf of
</p>
<p>the accused, I ask the attention of the court to the following as the gentleman's (Mr.
</p>
<p>Johnson's) propositions :
</p>
<p>3 28
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>That Congress has not authorized, and, under the Constitution, cannot authorize the
</p>
<p>appointment of this commission.
</p>
<p>That this commission has, " as a court, no legal existence or authority," because the
</p>
<p>President, who alone appointed the commission, has no such power.
</p>
<p>That his act " is a mere nullity the usurpation of a power not vested in the Execu-
</p>
<p>tive, and conferring no authority upon you."
</p>
<p>We have had no common exhibition of law learning in this defence, prepared by a
</p>
<p>Senator of the United States; but with all his experience, and all his learning and
</p>
<p>acknowledged ability, he has failed, utterly failed, to show how a tribunal constituted
</p>
<p>and sworn, as this has been, to duly try and determine the charge and specification
</p>
<p>against the accused, and by its commission not authorized to hear or determine any
</p>
<p>other issues whatever, can rightfully entertain, or can by any possibility pass upon, the
</p>
<p>proposition presented by this argument of the gentleman for its consideration.
</p>
<p>The members of this court are officers in the army of the United States, and by
</p>
<p>order of the President, as Commander-in-Chief, are required to discharge this duty, and
</p>
<p>are authorized in this capacity to discharge no other duty, to exercise no other judicial
</p>
<p>power. Of course, if the commission of the President constitutes this a court for the
</p>
<p>trial of this case only, as such court it is competent to decide all questions of law and
</p>
<p>fact arising in the trial of the case. But this court has no power, as a court, to declare
</p>
<p>the authority by which it was constituted null and void, and the act *of the President a
</p>
<p>mere nullity, a usurpation. Has it been shown by the learned gentleman, who demands
</p>
<p>that this court shall so decide, that officers of the army may lawfully and constitutionally
</p>
<p>question in this manner the orders of their Commander-in-Chief, disobey, set them aside,
</p>
<p>and declare them a nullity and a usurpation ? Even if it be conceded that the officers
</p>
<p>thus detailed by order of the Commander-in-Chief may question and utterly disregard
</p>
<p>his order and set -aside his authority, is it possible, in the nature of things, that any body
</p>
<p>of men, constituted and qualified as a tribunal of justice, can sit in judgment upon the
</p>
<p>proposition that they are not a court for any purpose, and finally decide judicially, as a
</p>
<p>court, that the government which appointed them was without authority? Why not
</p>
<p>crown the absurdity of this proposition by asking the several members of this court to
</p>
<p>determine that they are not men living, intelligent, responsible men? This would be
</p>
<p>no more irrational than the question upon which they are asked to pass. How can any
</p>
<p>sensible man entertain it? Before he begins to reason upon the proposition he must

</p>
<p>take for granted, and therefore decide in advance, the very question in dispute, to wit,
</p>
<p>his actual existence.
</p>
<p>So with the question presented in this remarkable argument for the defence: before
</p>
<p>this court can enter upon the inquiry of the want of authority in the President to con-
</p>
<p>stitute them a courjt, they must take for granted and decide the very point in issue, that
</p>
<p>the President had* the authority, and that they are in law and in fact a judicial tribunal;
</p>
<p>and having assumed this, they are gravely asked, as such judicial tribunal, to finally and
</p>
<p>solemnly decide and declare that they are not in fact or in law a judicial tribunal, but a
</p>
<p>mere nullity and nonentity. A most lame and impotent conclusion !
</p>
<p>As the learned counsel seems to have great reverence for judicial authority, and
</p>
<p>requires precedent for every opinion, I may be pardoned for saying that the objection
</p>
<p>which I urge against the possibility of any judicial tribunal, after being officially quali-
</p>
<p>fied as such, entertaining, much less judicially deciding, the proposition that it has no
</p>
<p>legal existence as a court, and that the appointment was a usurpation and without
</p>
<p>authority of law, has been solemnly ruled by the Supreme Court of the United States.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 329
</p>
<p>That court say: "The acceptance of the judicial office is a recognition of the
</p>
<p>arithority from which it is derived. If a court should enter upon the inquiry (whether
</p>
<p>the authority of the government which established it existed), and should come to the
</p>
<p>conclusion that the government under which it acted had been put aside, it would cease
</p>
<p>to be a court and be incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon the question it
</p>
<p>undertook to try. If it decides at all as a court, it necessarily affirms the existence and
</p>
<p>authority of the government under which it is exercising judicial power." (Luther vs.
</p>
<p>Borden, 7 Howard, 40.)
</p>
<p>That is the very question raised by the learned gentleman in his argument that
</p>
<p>there was no authority in the President, by whose act alone this tribunal was consti-
</p>
<p>tuted, to vest it with judicial power to try this issue; and by the order upon your record,
</p>
<p>as has already been shown, if you have no power to try this issue for want of authority
</p>
<p>in the Commander-in-Chief to constitute you a court, you are no court, and have no
</p>
<p>power to try any issue, because his order limits you to this issue, and this alone.
</p>
<p>It requires no very profound legal attainments to apply the ruling of the highest
</p>
<p>judicial tribunal of this country, just cited, to the point raised, not by the pleadings, but
</p>
<p>by the argument. This court exists as a judicial tribunal by authority only of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the United States; the acceptance of the office is an acknowledgment of the
</p>
<p>validity of the authority conferring it, and if the President had no authority to order,
</p>
<p>direct, and constitute this court to try the accused, and, as is claimed, did, in so consti-
</p>
<p>tuting it, perform an unconstitutional and illegal act, it necessarily results that the order
</p>
<p>of the President is void and of no effect; that the order did not and could not constitute
</p>
<p>this a tribunal of justice, and therefore its members are incapable of pronouncing a judi-
</p>
<p>cial decision upon the question presented.
</p>
<p>There is a marked distinction between the question here presented and that raised
</p>
<p>by a plea to the jurisdiction of a tribunal whose existence as a court is neither questioned
</p>
<p>nor denied. Here it is argued, through many pages, by a learned Senator, and a dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished lawyer, that the order of the President, by whose authority alone this court
</p>
<p>is constituted a tribunal of military justice, is unlawful; if unlawful it is void and of no
</p>
<p>effect, and has created no court; therefore this body, not being a court, can have no
</p>
<p>more power as a court to decide any question whatever than have its individual members
</p>
<p>power to decide that they as men do not in fact exist.
</p>
<p>It is a maxim of the common law the perfection of human reason that what is
</p>
<p>impossible the law requires of no man.

<p>How can it be possible that a judicial tribunal can decide the question that it does
</p>
<p>not exist, any more than that a rational man can decide that he does not exist?
</p>
<p>The absurdity of the proposition so elaborately urged upon the consideration of this
</p>
<p>court cannot be saved from the ridicule and contempt of sensible men by the pretence
</p>
<p>that the court is not asked judicially to decide that it is not a court, but only that it has
</p>
<p>no jurisdiction; for it is a fact not to be denied that the whole argument for the defence
</p>
<p>on this point is that the President had not the lawful authority to issue the order by
</p>
<p>which alone this court is constituted, and that the order for its creation is null and void.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen might as well ask the Supreme Court of the United States upon a plea to
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction to decide, as a court, that the President had no lawful authority to nom-
</p>
<p>inate the judges thereof severally to the Senate, and that the Senate had no lawful
</p>
<p>authority to advise and consent to their appointment, as to ask this court to decide, as a
</p>
<p>court, that the order of the President of the United States, constituting it a tribunal for
</p>
<p>the sole purpose of this trial, was not only without authority of law, but against and in
</p>
<p>330 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>violation of law. If this court is not a lawful tribunal, it has no existence, and can no
</p>
<p>more speak as a court than the dead, much less pronounce the judgment required at his
</p>
<p>hands that it is not a court, and that the President of the United States, in constituting
</p>
<p>it such to try the question upon the charge and specification preferred, has transcended
</p>
<p>his authority, and violated his oath of office.
</p>
<p>Before passing from the consideration of the proposition of the learned senator, that
</p>
<p>this is not a court, it is fit that I should notice that another of the counsel for the
</p>
<p>accused (Mr. Ewing) has also advanced the same opinion, certainly with more directness
</p>
<p>and candor, and without any qualification. His statement is, "You," gentlemen, "are
</p>
<p>no court under the Constitution." This remark of the gentleman cannot fail to excite
</p>
<p>surprise, when it is remembered that the gentleman, not many months since, was a
</p>
<p>general in the service of the country, and as such in his department in the West pro-
</p>
<p>claimed and enforced martial law by the constitution of military tribunals for the trial
</p>
<p>of citizens not in the land or naval forces, but who were guilty of military offences, for
</p>
<p>which he deemed them justly punishable before military courts, and accordingly he
</p>
<p>punished them. Is the gentleman quite sure, when that account comes to be rendered
</p>
<p>for these alleged unconstitutional assumptions of power, that he will not have to answer
</p>
<p>for more of these alleged violations of the rights of citizens by illegal arrests, convic-
</p>
<p>tions, and executions, than any of the members of this court? In support of his opin-
</p>
<p>ion that this is no court, the gentleman cites the 3d article of the Constitution, which
</p>
<p>provides " that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme
</p>
<p>court, and such inferior courts as Congress may establish," the judges whereof "shall
</p>
<p>hold their offices during good behavior."
</p>
<p>It is a sufficient answer to say to the gentleman, that the power of this government
</p>
<p>to try and punish military offences by military tribunals is no part of the " judicial
</p>
<p>power of the United States," under the 3d article of the Constitution, but a power
</p>
<p>conferred by the 8th section of the 1st article, and so it has been ruled by the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court in Dyres vs. Hoover, 20 Howard, 78. If this power is so conferred by the 8th
</p>
<p>section, a military court authorized by Congress, and constituted as this has been, to try
</p>
<p>all persons for military crimes in time of war, though not exercising "the judicial
</p>
<p>power" provided for in the 3d article, is nevertheless a court as constitutional as the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court itself. The gentleman admits this to the extent of the trial by courts-
</p>
<p>martial of persons in the military or naval service, and by admitting it he gives up the
</p>
<p>point. There is no express grant for any such tribunal, and the power to establish such

</p>
<p>a court, therefore, is implied from the provisions of the 8th section, ist article, that
</p>
<p>" Congress shall have power to provide and maintain a navy," and also " to make rules
</p>
<p>for the government of the land and naval forces." From these grants the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court infer the power to establish courts-martial, and from the grants in the same 8th
</p>
<p>section, as I shall notice hereafter, that " Congress shall have power to declare war,"
</p>
<p>and " to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry this and all other powers into effect,"
</p>
<p>it is necessarily implied that in time of war Congress may authorize military commissions,
</p>
<p>to try all crimes committed in aid of the public enemy, as such tribunals are necessary to
</p>
<p>give effect to the power to make war and suppress insurrection.
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the gentleman (General Ewing), for whom, personally, I have a high
</p>
<p>regard as the military commander of a Western department, made a liberal exercise,
</p>
<p>under the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the army, of this power to arrest and
</p>
<p>try military offenders not in the land or naval forces of the United States, and inflicted
</p>
<p>upon them, as I am informed, the extreme penalty of the law, by virtue of his military
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>331
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, I wish to know whether he proposes, by his proclamation of the personal
</p>
<p>responsibility awaiting all such usurpations of judicial authority, that he himself shall be
</p>
<p>subjected to the same stern judgment which he invokes against others that, in short,
</p>
<p>he shall be drawn and quartered for inflicting the extreme penalties of the law upon
</p>
<p>citizens of the United States in violation of the Constitution and laws of his country?
</p>
<p>I trust that his error of judgment in pronouncing this military jurisdiction a usurpation
</p>
<p>and violation of the Constitution may not rise up in judgment to condemn him, and that
</p>
<p>he may never be subjected to pains and penalties for having done his duty heretofore in
</p>
<p>exercising this rightful authority, and in bringing to judgment those who conspired
</p>
<p>against the lives and liberties of the people.
</p>
<p>Here I might leave this question, committing it to the charitable speeches of men,
</p>
<p>but for the fact that the learned counsel has been more careful in his extraordinary argu-
</p>
<p>ment to denounce the President as a usurper than to show how the court could possibly
</p>
<p>decide that it has no judicial existence, and yet that it has judicial existence.
</p>
<p>A representative of the people and of the rights of the people before this court, by
</p>
<p>the appointment of the President, and which appointment was neither sought by me
</p>
<p>nor desired, I cannot allow all that has been here said by way of denunciation of the
</p>
<p>murdered President and his successor to pass unnoticed. This has been made the occa-
</p>
<p>sion by the learned counsel, Mr. Johnson, to volunteer, not to defend the accused,
</p>
<p>Mary E. Surratt, not to make a judicial argument in her behalf, but to make a political
</p>
<p>harangue, a partisan speech against his government and country, and thereby swell the
</p>
<p>cry of the armed legions of sedition and rebellion that but yesterday shook the heavens
</p>
<p>with their infernal enginery of treason, and filled the habitations of the people with
</p>
<p>death. As the law forbids a senator of the United States to receive compensation or
</p>
<p>fee for defending, in cases before civil or military commissions, the gentleman volunteers
</p>
<p>to make a speech before this court, in which he denounces the action of the Executive
</p>
<p>Department in proclaiming and executing martial law against rebels in arms, their aiders
</p>
<p>and abettors, as a usurpation and a tyranny. I deem it my duty to reply to this denun-
</p>
<p>ciation, not for the purpose of presenting thereby any question for the decision of this
</p>
<p>court, for I have shown that the argument of the gentleman presents no question for its
</p>
<p>decision as a court, but to repel, as far as I may be able, the unjust aspersion attempted
</p>
<p>to be cast upon the memory of our dead President, and upon the official conduct of his
</p>
<p>successor.

</p>
<p>I propose now to answer fully all that the gentleman (Mr. Johnson) has said of the
</p>
<p>want of jurisdiction in this court, and of the alleged usurpation and tyranny of the
</p>
<p>Executive, that the enlightened public opinion to which he appeals may decide whether
</p>
<p>all this denunciation is just whether indeed conspiring against the whole people, and
</p>
<p>confederation and agreement, in aid of insurrection to murder all the executive officers
</p>
<p>of the government, cannot be checked or arrested by the Executive power. Let the
</p>
<p>people decide this question; and in doing so, let them pass upon the action of the
</p>
<p>senator as well as upon the action of those whom he so arrogantly arraigns. His plea
</p>
<p>in behalf of an expiring and shattered rebellion is a fit subject for public consideration
</p>
<p>and for public condemnation.
</p>
<p>Let that people also note that, while the learned gentleman (Mr. Johnson), as a
</p>
<p>volunteer, without pay, thus condemns as a usurpation the means employed so effectually
</p>
<p>to suppress this gigantic insurrection, the New York News, whose proprietor, Benjamin*
</p>
<p>Wood, is shown by the testimony upon your record to have received from the agents of
</p>
<p>ihe rebellion twenty-five thousand dollars, rushes into the lists to champion the cause of
</p>
<p>33 2 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>the rebellion, its aiders and abettors, by following to the letter his colleague (Mr.
</p>
<p>Johnson), and with greater plainness of speech, and a fervor intensified, doubtless, by
</p>
<p>the twenty-five thousand dollars received, and the hope of more, denounces the court as
</p>
<p>a usurpation and threatens the members with the consequences !
</p>
<p>The argument of the gentleman, to which the court has listened so patiently and so
</p>
<p>long, is but an attempt to show that it is unconstitutional for the government of the
</p>
<p>United States to arrest upon military order and try before military tribunals and punish
</p>
<p>upon conviction, in accordance with the laws of war and the usages of nations, all crim-
</p>
<p>inal offenders acting in aid of the existing rebellion. It does seem to me that the speech
</p>
<p>in its tone and temper is the same as that which the country has heard for the last four
</p>
<p>years uttered by the armed rebels themselves and by their apologists, averring that it was
</p>
<p>unconstitutional for the government of the United States to defend by arms its own right-
</p>
<p>ful authority and the supremacy of its laws.
</p>
<p>It is as clearly the right of the republic to live and to defend its life until it forfeits
</p>
<p>that right by crime, as it is the right of the individual to live so long as God gives him
</p>
<p>life, unless he forfeits that right by crime. I make no argument to support this proposi-
</p>
<p>tion. Who is there here or elsewhere to cast the reproach upon my country that for her
</p>
<p>crimes she must die ? Youngest born of the nations ! is she not immortal by all the"
</p>
<p>dread memories of the past by that sublime and voluntary sacrifice of the present, in
</p>
<p>which the bravest and noblest of her sons have laid down their lives that she might live,
</p>
<p>giving their serene brows to the dust of the grave, and lifting their hands for the last
</p>
<p>time amidst the consuming fires of battle? I assume, for the purposes of this argument,
</p>
<p>that self-defence is as clearly the right of nations as it is the acknowledged right of men,
</p>
<p>and that the American people may do in the defence and maintenance of their own
</p>
<p>rightful authority against organized armed rebels, their aiders and abettors, whatever
</p>
<p>free and independent nations anywhere upon this globe, in time of war, may of right do.
</p>
<p>All this is substantially denied by the gentleman in the remarkable argument which
</p>
<p>he has here made. There is nothing further from my purpose than to do injustice to the
</p>
<p>learned gentleman or to his elaborate and ingenious argument. To justify what I have
</p>
<p>already said, I may be permitted here to remind the court that nothing is said by the
</p>
<p>counsel touching the conduct of the accused, Mary E. Surratt, as shown by the testi-
</p>
<p>mony; that he makes confession at the end of his arraignment of the government and
</p>
<p>country, that he has not made such argument, and that he leaves it to be made by her
</p>
<p>other counsel. He does take care, however, to arraign the country and the government

</p>
<p>for conducting a trial with closed doors and before a secret tribunal, and compares the
</p>
<p>proceedings of this court to the Spanish Inquisition, using the strongest words at his
</p>
<p>command to intensify the horror which he supposes his announcement will excite through-
</p>
<p>out the civilized world.
</p>
<p>Was this dealing fairly by this government ? Was there anything in . the conduct of
</p>
<p>the proceedings here that justified any such remark? Has this been a secret trial? Has
</p>
<p>it not been conducted in open day in the presence of the accused, and in the presence
</p>
<p>of seven gentlemen learned in the law, who appeared from day to day as their counsel?
</p>
<p>Were they not informed of the accusation against them? Were they deprived of the
</p>
<p>right of challenge? Was it not secured to them by law, and were they not asked to
</p>
<p>exercise it? Has any part of the evidence been suppressed? Have not all the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings been published to the world? What, then, was done, or intended to be done,
</p>
<p>by the government, which justifies this clamor about a Spanish Inquisition?
</p>
<p>That a people assailed by organized treason over an extent of territory half as large
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 333
</p>
<p>as the continent of Europe, and assailed in their very capital by secret assassins banded
</p>
<p>together and hired to do the work of murder by the instigation of these conspirators,
</p>
<p>may not be permitted to make inquiry, even with closed doors, touching the nature and
</p>
<p>extent of the organization, ought not to be asserted by any gentleman who makes the
</p>
<p>least pretensions to any knowledge of the law, either common, civil, or military. Who
</p>
<p>does not know that at the common law all inquisition touching crimes and misdemeanors,
</p>
<p>preparatory to indictment by the grand inquest of the state, is made with closed doors?
</p>
<p>In this trial no parties accused, nor their counsel, nor the reporters of this court,
</p>
<p>were at any time excluded from its deliberations when any testimony was being taken ;
</p>
<p>nor has there been any testimony taken in the case with closed doors, save that of a few
</p>
<p>witnesses, who testified, not in regard to the accused or either of them, but in respect to
</p>
<p>the traitors and conspirators not on trial, who were alleged to have incited this crime.
</p>
<p>Who is there to say that the American people, in time of armed rebellion and civil war,
</p>
<p>have not the right to make such an examination as secretly as they may deem necessary,
</p>
<p>either in a military or civil court?
</p>
<p>I have said this, not by way of apology for anything the government has done or
</p>
<p>attempted to do in the progress of this trial, but to expose the animus of the argument,
</p>
<p>and to repel the accusation against my country sent out to the world by the counsel.
</p>
<p>From anything- that he has said, I have yet to learn that the American people have not
</p>
<p>the right to make their inquiries secretly, touching a general conspiracy in aid of an
</p>
<p>existing rebellion, which involves their nationality and the peace and security of all.
</p>
<p>The gentleman then enters into a learned argument for the purpose of showing that,
</p>
<p>by the Constitution, the people of the United States cannot, in war or in peace, subject
</p>
<p>any person to trial before a military tribunal, whatever may be his crime or offence,
</p>
<p>unless such person be in the military or naval service of the United States. The con-
</p>
<p>duct of this argument is as remarkable as its assaults upon the government are unwar-
</p>
<p>ranted, and its insinuations about the revival of the Inquisition and secret trials are
</p>
<p>inexcusable. The court will notice that the argument, from the beginning almost to its
</p>
<p>conclusion, insists that no person is liable to be tried by military or martial law before a
</p>
<p>military tribunal, save those in the land and naval service of the United States. I
</p>
<p>repeat, the conduct of this argument of the gentleman is remarkable. As an instance,
</p>
<p>I ask the attention not only of this court, but of that public whom he has ventured to
</p>
<p>address in this tone and temper, to the authority of the distinguished Chancellor Kent,
</p>
<p>whose great name the counsel has endeavored to press into his service in support of his

</p>
<p>general proposition, that no person save those in the military or naval service of the
</p>
<p>United States is liable to be tried for any crime whatever, either in peace or in war,
</p>
<p>before a military tribunal.
</p>
<p>The language of the gentleman, after citing the provision of the Constitution, " that
</p>
<p>no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a
</p>
<p>presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval
</p>
<p>forces or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger," is,
</p>
<p>" that this exception is designed to leave in force, not to enlarge, the power vested in
</p>
<p>Congress by the original Constitution to make rules for the government and regulation
</p>
<p>of the land and naval forces; that the land or naval forces are the terms used in both,
</p>
<p>have the same meaning, and until lately have been supposed by every commentator and
</p>
<p>judge to exclude from military jurisdiction offences committed by citizens not belonging
</p>
<p>to such forces." The learned gentleman then adds: " Kent, in a note to his ist Com-
</p>
<p>mentaries, 341, states, and with accuracy, that ' military and naval crimes and offences
</p>
<p>334 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>committed while the party is attached to and under the immediate authority of the army
</p>
<p>and navy of the United States and in actual service, are not cognizable under the com-
</p>
<p>mon-law jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.' " I ask this court to bear in
</p>
<p>mind that this is the only passage which he quotes from this note of Kent in his argu-
</p>
<p>ment, and that no man possessed of common sense, however destitute he may be of the
</p>
<p>exact and varied learning in the law to which the gentleman may rightfully lay claim,
</p>
<p>can for a moment entertain the opinion that the distinguished chancellor of New York,
</p>
<p>in the passage just cited, intimates any such thing as the counsel asserts, that the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution excludes from military jurisdiction offences committed by citizens not belonging
</p>
<p>to the land or naval forces.
</p>
<p>Who can fail to see that Chancellor Kent, by the passage cited, only decides that
</p>
<p>military and naval crimes and offences committed by a party attached to and under the
</p>
<p>immediate authority of the army and navy of the United States, and in actual service,
</p>
<p>are not cognizable under the common-law jurisdiction of the courts of the United States?
</p>
<p>He only says they are not cognizable under its common-law jurisdiction; but by that he
</p>
<p>does not say or intimate what is attempted to be said by the counsel for him, that " all
</p>
<p>crimes committed by citizens are by the Constitution excluded from military jurisdiction,"
</p>
<p>and that the perpetrators of them can under no circumstances be tried before military
</p>
<p>tribunals. Yet the counsel ventures to proceed, standing upon this passage quoted from
</p>
<p>Kent, to say that, "according to this great authority, every other class of persons and
</p>
<p>every other species of offences are within the jurisdiction of the civil courts, and entitled
</p>
<p>to the protection of the proceeding by presentment or indictment and the public trial in
</p>
<p>such a court."
</p>
<p>Whatever that great authority may have said elsewhere, it is very doubtful whether
</p>
<p>any candid man in America will be able to come to the very learned and astute conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that Chancellor Kent has so stated in the note or any part of the note which the
</p>
<p>gentleman has just cited. If he has said it elsewhere, it is for the gentleman, if he
</p>
<p>relies upon Kent for authority, to produce the passage. But was it fair treatment of this
</p>
<p>" great authority " : was it not taking an unwarrantable privilege with the distinguished
</p>
<p>chancellor and his great work, the enduring monument of his learning and genius, to so
</p>
<p>mutilate the note referred to as might leave the gentleman at liberty to make his deduc-
</p>
<p>tions and assertions under cover of the great name of the New York chancellor, to suit
</p>
<p>the emergency of his case by omitting the following passage, which occurs in the same
</p>
<p>note, and absolutely excludes the conclusion so defiantly put forth by the counsel to
</p>

</p>
<p>support his argument ? In that note Chancellor Kent says :
</p>
<p>" Military law is a system of regulations for. the government of the armies in the
</p>
<p>service of the United States, authorized by the act of Congress of April 10, 1806,
</p>
<p>known as the Articles of War, and naval law is a similar system for the government of
</p>
<p>the navy, under the act of Congress of April 23, 1800. But martial 'law is quite a dis-
</p>
<p>tinct thing, and is founded upon paramount necessity and proclaimed by a military chief."
</p>
<p>However unsuccessful, after this exposure, the gentleman appears in maintaining
</p>
<p>his monstrous proposition, that the American people are by their own Constitution
</p>
<p>forbidden to try the aiders and abettors of armed traitors and rebellion before military
</p>
<p>tribunals, and subject them, according to the laws of war and the usages of nations, to
</p>
<p>just punishment for their great crimes, it has been made clear from what I have already
</p>
<p>stated that he has been eminently successful in mutilating this beautiful production of
</p>
<p>that great mind; which act of mutilation every one knows is violative alike of the laws
</p>
<p>of peace and war. Even in war the divine creations of art and the immortal productions
</p>
<p>of genius and learning are spared.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 335
</p>
<p>In the same spirit, and it seems to me with the same unfairness as that just noted,,
</p>
<p>the learned gentleman has very adroitly pressed into his service by an extract from the
</p>
<p>autobiography of the war-worn veteran and hero, General Scott, the na'mes of the late
</p>
<p>secretary of war, Mr. Marcy, and the learned ex-attorney general, Mr. Gushing.
</p>
<p>This adroit performance is achieved in this way : after stating the fact that General Scott
</p>
<p>in Mexico proclaimed martial law for the trial and punishment by military tribunals of
</p>
<p>persons guilty of " assassination, murder, and poisoning," the gentleman proceeds to,
</p>
<p>quote from the autobiography, "that this order when handed to the then secretary of
</p>
<p>war (Mr. Marcy) for his approval, ' a startle at the title (martial law order) was the
</p>
<p>only comment he then or ever made on the subject,' and that it was 'soon silently
</p>
<p>returned as too explosive for safe handling.' 'A little later (he adds) the attorney
</p>
<p>general (Mr. Gushing) called and asked for a copy, and the law officer of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, whose business it is to speak on all such matters, was stricken with, legal dumb-
</p>
<p>ness.'' " Thereupon the learned gentleman proceeds to say: " How much more startled
</p>
<p>and more paralyzed would these great men have been had they been consulted on such
</p>
<p>a commission as this ! A commission, not to sit in another country, and to try offences
</p>
<p>not provided for in any law of the United States, civil or military, then in force, but in
</p>
<p>their own country, and in a part of it where there are laws providing for their trial and
</p>
<p>punishment, and civil courts clothed with ample powers for both, and in the daily and
</p>
<p>undisturbed exercise of their jurisdiction."
</p>
<p>I think I may safely say, without stopping to make any special references, that the
</p>
<p>official career of the late secretary of war (Mr. Marcy) gave no indication that he ever
</p>
<p>doubted or denied the constitutional power of the American people, acting through their
</p>
<p>duly constituted agents, to do any act justified by the laws of war for the suppression of
</p>
<p>a rebellion or to repel invasion. Certainly there is nothing in this extract from the
</p>
<p>autobiography which justifies any such conclusion. He was startled we are told. It
</p>
<p>may have been as much the admiration he had for the boldness and wisdom of the
</p>
<p>conqueror of Mexico as any abhorrence he had for the trial and punishment of
</p>
<p>" assassins, poisoners, and murderers," according to the laws and usages of war.
</p>
<p>But the official utterances of the ex-attorney general, Gushing, with which the
</p>
<p>gentleman doubtless was familiar when he prepared this argument, by no means justify
</p>
<p>the attempt here made to quote him as authority against the proclamation and enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of martial law in time of rebellion and civil war. That distinguished man, not
</p>
<p>second in legal attainments to any who have held that position, has left an official

<p>opinion of record touching this subject. Referring to what is said by Sir Mathew Hale,
</p>
<p>in his " History of the Common Law," concerning martial law, wherein he limits it, as.
</p>
<p>the gentleman has seemed by the whole drift of his argument desirous of doing, and
</p>
<p>says that it is " not in truth and in reality law, but something indulged rather than
</p>
<p>allowed as a law the necessity of government, order, and discipline in an army,"
</p>
<p>Mr. Gushing makes this just criticism: "This proposition is a mere composite blunder,
</p>
<p>a total misapprehension of the matter. It confounds martial law and law military ; it
</p>
<p>ascribes to the former the uses of the latter; it erroneouly assumes that the government
</p>
<p>of a body of troops is a necessity more than of a body of civilians or citizens. It con-
</p>
<p>founds and confuses all the relations of the subject, and is an apt illustration of the
</p>
<p>incompleteness of the notions of the common-law jurists of England in regard to matters
</p>
<p>not comprehended in that limited branch of legal science . . . Military law, it is
</p>
<p>now perfectly understood in England, is a branch of the law of the land, applicable
</p>
<p>only to certain acts of a particular class of persons and administered by special tribunals;
</p>
<p>336 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>but neither in that nor in any other respect essentially differing as to foundation in
</p>
<p>constitutional reason from admiralty, ecclesiastical, or indeed ^chancery and common law.
</p>
<p>It is the system of rules for the government of the army and navy estab-
</p>
<p>lished by successive acts of Parliament. . . . Martial law, as exercised in any
</p>
<p>country by the commander of a foreign army, is an element of thejtts belli.
</p>
<p>" It is incidental to the state of solemn war, and appertains to the law of nations.
</p>
<p>. . . Thus, while the armies of the United States occupied different provinces
</p>
<p>of the Mexican republic, the respective commanders were not limited in authority by
</p>
<p>any local law. They allowed, or rather required, the magistrates of the country,
</p>
<p>municipal or judicial, to continue to administer the laws of the country among their
</p>
<p>countrymen; but in subjection always to the military power, which acted summarily and
</p>
<p>according to discretion, when the belligerent interests of the conqueror required it, and
</p>
<p>which exercised jurisdiction, either summarily or by means of military commissions for
</p>
<p>the protection or the punishment of citizens of the United States in Mexico."
</p>
<p>Opinions of Attorneys General, vol. viii., 366-69.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gushing says, " That, it would seem, was one of the forms of martial law "; but
</p>
<p>he adds that such an example of martial law administered by a foreign army in the
</p>
<p>enemy's country "does not enlighten us in regard to the question of martial law in
</p>
<p>one's own country, and as administered by its military commanders. That is a case
</p>
<p>which the law of nations does not reach. Its regulation is of the domestic resort of the
</p>
<p>organic laws of the country itself, and regarding which, as it happens, there is no
</p>
<p>definite or explicit legislation in the United States, as there is none in England.
</p>
<p>"Accordingly, in England, as we have seen, Earl Grey assumes that when martial
</p>
<p>law exists it has no legal origin, but is a mere fact of necessity to be legalized afterwards
</p>
<p>by a bill of indemnity if there be occasion. I am not prepared to say that, under
</p>
<p>existing laws, such may not also be the case in the United States." Ibid., 370.
</p>
<p>After such a statement, wherein ex-Attorney General Gushing very clearly recognizes
</p>
<p>the right of this government, as also of England, to employ martial law as a means of
</p>
<p>defence in a time of war, whether -.domestic or foreign, he will be as much surprised
</p>
<p>when he reads the argument of the learned gentleman, wherein he is described as being
</p>
<p>struck with legal dumbness at the mere mention of proclaiming martial law and its
</p>
<p>enforcement by the commander of our army in Mexico, as the late secretary of war
</p>
<p>was startled with even the mention of its title.
</p>
<p>Even some of the reasons given, and certainly the power exercised by the veteran

</p>
<p>hero himself, would seem to be in direct conflict with the propositions of the learned
</p>
<p>gentleman.
</p>
<p>The lieutenant-general says he "excludes from his order cases already cognizable by
</p>
<p>court-martial, and limits it to cases not provided for in the act of Congress establishing
</p>
<p>rules and articles for the government of the armies of the United States." Has not the
</p>
<p>gentleman who attempts to press General Scott into his service argued and insisted upon
</p>
<p>it that the commander of the army cannot subject the soldiers under his command to
</p>
<p>any control or punishment whatever, save that which is provided for in the articles?
</p>
<p>It will not do, in order to sustain the gentleman's hypothesis, to say that these pro-
</p>
<p>visions of the Constitution, by which he attempts to fetter the power of the people to
</p>
<p>punish such offences in time of war within the territory of the United States, may be
</p>
<p>disregarded by an officer of the United States in command of its armies, in the trial and
</p>
<p>punishment of its soldiers in a foreign war. The law of the United States for the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of its own armies follows the flag upon every sea and in every land.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 337
</p>
<p>The truth is, that the right of the people to proclaim and execute martial law is a
</p>
<p>necessary incident of war, and this was the right exercised, and rightfully exercised, by
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Scott in Mexico. It was what Earl Grey has justly said was a " fact
</p>
<p>of necessity," and I may add, an act as clearly authorized as was the act of fighting the
</p>
<p>enemy when they appeared before him.
</p>
<p>In making this exception, the lieutenant-general followed the rule recognized by the
</p>
<p>American authorities on military law, in which it is declared that " many crimes com-
</p>
<p>mitted even by military officers, enlisted men, or camp-retainers, cannot be tried under
</p>
<p>the rules and articles of war. Military commissions must be resorted to for such cases,
</p>
<p>and these commissions should be ordered by the same authority, be constituted in a
</p>
<p>similar manner, and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules
</p>
<p>as general courts-martial." Benet, 15.
</p>
<p>There remain for me to notice, at present, two other points in this extraordinary
</p>
<p>speech : first, that martial law does not warrant a military commission for the trial of
</p>
<p>military offences that is, offences committed in time of war in the interests of the
</p>
<p>public enemy and by concert and agreement with the enemy; and second, that martial
</p>
<p>law does not prevail in the United States, and has never been declared by any compe-
</p>
<p>tent authority.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary, as the gentleman himself has declined to argue the first point,
</p>
<p>whether martial law authorizes the organization of military commissions by order of the
</p>
<p>commander-in-chief to try such offences, that I should say more than that the authority
</p>
<p>just cited by me shows that such commissions are authorized under martial law, and are
</p>
<p>created by the commander for the trial of all such offences when their punishment by
</p>
<p>court-martial is not provided for by the express statute law of the country.
</p>
<p>The second point, that martial law has not been declared by any competent author-
</p>
<p>ity, is an arraignment of the late murdered President of the United States for his
</p>
<p>proclamation of September 24, 1862, declaring martial law throughout the United States,
</p>
<p>and of which, in Lawrence's edition of Wheaton on International Law, p. 522, it is
</p>
<p>said, " Whatever may be the inference to be deduced either from constitutional or inter-
</p>
<p>national law, or from the usages of European governments, as to the legitimate deposi-
</p>
<p>tory of the power of suspending the writ of habeas corpus, the virtual abrogation of the
</p>
<p>judiciary in cases affecting individual liberty, and the establishment as matter of fact in
</p>
<p>the United States, by the Executive alone, of martial law, not merely in the insurrec-
</p>
<p>tionary districts or in cases of military occupancy, but throughout the entire Union, and

</p>
<p>not temporarily, but as an institution as permanent as the insurrection on which it pro-
</p>
<p>fesses to be based, and capable on the same principle of being revived in all cases of
</p>
<p>foreign as well as civil war, are placed beyond question by the President's proclamation
</p>
<p>of September 24, 1862." That proclamation is as follows:
</p>
<p>"Bv THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
</p>
<p>"A PROCLAMATION.
</p>
<p>" Whereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers, but also
</p>
<p>portions of the militia of the states, by a draft, in order to suppress the insurrection
</p>
<p>existing in the United States, and disloyal persons are not adequately restrained by the
</p>
<p>ordinary processes of law from hindering this measure and from giving aid and comfort
</p>
<p>in various ways to the insurrection: Now, therefore, be it ordered that, during the
</p>
<p>existing insurrection, and 'as a necessary means for suppressing the same, all rebels and
</p>
<p>insurgents, their aiders and abettors, within the United States, and all persons discour-
</p>
<p>aging volunteer enlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice
</p>
<p>338 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>affording aid and comfort to rebels, against the authority of the United States, shall be
</p>
<p>subject to martial law and liable to trial and punishment by courts-martial or military
</p>
<p>commission.
</p>
<p>" Second. That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all persons
</p>
<p>arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall be, imprisoned in any
</p>
<p>fort, camp, arsenal, military prison, or other place of confinement, by any military
</p>
<p>authority or by the sentence of any court-martial or military commission.
</p>
<p>" In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United
</p>
<p>States to be affixed.
</p>
<p>" Done at the city of Washington, this 24th day of September, A.D. 1862, and of
</p>
<p>the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.
</p>
<p>"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>" By the President:
</p>
<p>" WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
</p>
<p>" Secretary of State."
</p>
<p>This proclamation is duly certified from the War Department to be in full force and
</p>
<p>not revoked, and is evidence of record in this case ; and but a few days since a procla-
</p>
<p>mation of the President, of which this court will take notice, declares that the same
</p>
<p>remains in full force.
</p>
<p>It has been said by another of the counsel for the accused (Mr. Stone) in his argu-
</p>
<p>ment, that, admitting its validity, the proclamation ceases to have effect with the insur-
</p>
<p>rection, and is terminated by it. It is true the proclamation of martial law only
</p>
<p>continues during the insurrection; but inasmuch as the question of the existence of
</p>
<p>an insurrection is a political question, the decision of which belongs exclusively to the
</p>
<p>political department of the government, that department alone can declare its existence,
</p>
<p>and that department alone can declare its termination, and by the action of the political
</p>
<p>department of the government every judicial tribunal in the land is concluded and
</p>
<p>bound. That question has been settled for fifty years in this country by the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of the United States: First, in the case of Brown vs. The United States
</p>
<p>(8 Cranch); also in the prize cases (2 Black, 641). Nothing more, therefore, need
</p>
<p>be said upon this question of an existing insurrection than this: The political depart-
</p>
<p>ment of the government has heretofore proclaimed an insurrection; that department has
</p>
<p>not yet declared the insurrection ended, and the event on the I4th of April, which
</p>
<p>robbed the people of their chosen Executive, and clothed this land in mourning, bore

</p>
<p>sad but overwhelming witness to the fact that the rebellion is not ended. The fact of
</p>
<p>the insurrection is not an open question to be tried or settled by parol, either in a mili-
</p>
<p>tary tribunal or in a civil court.
</p>
<p>The declaration of the learned gentleman who opened the defence (Mr. Johnson),
</p>
<p>that martial law has never been declared by any competent authority, as I have already
</p>
<p>said, arraigns Mr. Lincoln for a usurpation of power. Does the gentleman mean to say
</p>
<p>that, until Congress authorizes it, the President cannot proclaim and enforce martial law
</p>
<p>in the suppression of armed and organized rebellion ? Or does he only affirm that this
</p>
<p>act of the late President is a usurpation?
</p>
<p>The proclamation of martial law in 1862 a usurpation! though it armed the people
</p>
<p>in that dark hour of trial with the means of defence against traitorous and secret enemies
</p>
<p>in every state and district of the country; though by its use some of the guilty were
</p>
<p>brought to swift and just judgment, and others deterred from crime or driven to flight;
</p>
<p>though by this means the innocent and defenceless were protected; though by this
</p>
<p>means the city of the gentleman's residence was saved from the violence and pillage of
</p>
<p>the mob and the torch of the incendiary. But, says the gentleman, it was a usurpation,
</p>
<p>forbidden by the laws of the land !
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 339
</p>
<p>The same was said of the proclamations of blockade issued April 19 and 27, 1861,
</p>
<p>which declared a blockade of the ports of the insurgent states, and that all vessels
</p>
<p>violating the same were subjects of capture, and, together with the cargo, to be con-
</p>
<p>demned as prize. Inasmuch as Congress had not then recognized the fact of civil war,
</p>
<p>these proclamations were denounced as void. The Supreme Court decided otherwise,
</p>
<p>and affirmed the power of the Executive thus to subject property on the seas to seizure
</p>
<p>and condemnation. I read from that decision:
</p>
<p>"The Constitution confers upon the President the whole executive power, he is
</p>
<p>bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; he is Commander-in-Chief of
</p>
<p>the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states when
</p>
<p>called into the actual service of the United States. . . . Whether the President, in
</p>
<p>fulfilling his duties as Commander-in-Chief in suppressing an insurrection, has met with
</p>
<p>such armed hostile resistance and a civil war of such alarming proportions as will compel
</p>
<p>him to accord to them the character of belligerents, is a question to be decided by him,
</p>
<p>and this court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the political department of
</p>
<p>the government to which this power was intrusted. He must determine what degree of
</p>
<p>force the crisis demands.
</p>
<p>"The proclamation of blockade is itself official and conclusive evidence to the court
</p>
<p>that a state of war existed which demanded and authorized a recourse to such a measure
</p>
<p>under the circumstances peculiar to the case." (2 Black, 670.)
</p>
<p>It has been solemnly ruled by the same tribunal, in an earlier case, " that the power
</p>
<p>is confided to the Executive of the Union to determine when it is necessary to call out
</p>
<p>the militia of the states to repel invasion," as follows: " That he is necessarily consti-
</p>
<p>tuted the judge of the existence of the exigency in the first instance, and is bound to act
</p>
<p>according to his belief of the facts. If he does so act, and decides to call forth the
</p>
<p>militia, his orders for this purpose are in strict conformity with the provisions of the
</p>
<p>law; and it would seem to follow as a necessary consequence, that every act done by a
</p>
<p>subordinate officer in obedience to such orders, is equally justifiable. The law con-
</p>
<p>templates that, under such circumstances, orders shall be given to carry the power into
</p>
<p>effect; and it cannot therefore be a correct inference that any other person has a just
</p>
<p>right to disobey them. The law does not provide for any appeal from the judgment
</p>
<p>of the President, or for any right in subordinate officers to review his decision, and in
</p>
<p>effect defeat it. Whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be
</p>
<p>exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule' of construc-

</p>
<p>tion that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of
</p>
<p>those facts." (12 Wheaton, 31.)
</p>
<p>In the light of these decisions, it must be clear to every mind that the question of
</p>
<p>the existence of an insurrection, and the necessity of calling into requisition for its
</p>
<p>suppression both the militia of the states and the army and navy of the United States,
</p>
<p>and of proclaiming martial law, which is an essential condition of war, whether foreign
</p>
<p>or domestic, must rest with the officer of the government who is charged by the express
</p>
<p>terms of the Constitution with the performance of this great duty for the common
</p>
<p>defence and the execution of the laws of the Union.
</p>
<p>But it is further insisted by the gentleman in this argument, that Congress has not
</p>
<p>authorized the establishment of military commissions, which are essential to the judicial
</p>
<p>administration of martial law and the punishment of crimes committed during the
</p>
<p>existence of a civil war, and especially that such commissions are not so authorized to
</p>
<p>try persons other than those in the military or naval service of the United States, or in
</p>
<p>34O APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>the militia of the several States, when in the actual service of the United States. The
</p>
<p>gentleman's argument assuredly destroys itself, for he insists that the Congress, as the
</p>
<p>legislative department of the government, can pass no law which, either in peace or war,
</p>
<p>can constitutionally subject any citizen not in the land or naval forces to trial for crime
</p>
<p>before a military tribunal, or otherwise than by a jury in the civil courts.
</p>
<p>Why does the learned gentleman now tell us that Congress has not authorized this to
</p>
<p>be done, after declaring just as stoutly that by the fifth and sixth amendments to the
</p>
<p>Constitution no such military tribunals can be established for the trial of any person not
</p>
<p>in the military or naval service of the United States, or in the militia when in actual
</p>
<p>service, for the commission of any crime whatever in time cff war or insurrection? It
</p>
<p>ought to have occurred to the gentleman when commenting upon the exception in the
</p>
<p>fifth article of the Constitution, that there was a reason for it very different from that
</p>
<p>which he saw fit to assign, and that reason manifestly upon the face of the Constitution
</p>
<p>itself, was, that by the eighth section of the first article, it is expressly provided that
</p>
<p>Congress shall have power to make rules for the government of the land and naval
</p>
<p>forces, and to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for
</p>
<p>governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States,
</p>
<p>and that, inasmuch as military discipline and order are as essential in an army in time of
</p>
<p>peace as in time of war, if the Constitution would leave this power to Congress in
</p>
<p>peace, it must make the exception, so that rules and regulations for the government of
</p>
<p>the army and navy should be operative in time of peace as well as in time of war;
</p>
<p>because the provisions of the Constitution give the right of trial by jury IN TIME OF
</p>
<p>PEACE, in all criminal prosecutions by indictment, in terms embracing every human
</p>
<p>being that may be held to answer for crime in the United States; and therefore if the
</p>
<p>eighth section of the first article was to remain in full force IN TIME OF PEACE, the
</p>
<p>exception must be made; and, accordingly, the exception was made. But by the
</p>
<p>argument we have listened to, this court is told, and the country is told, that IN TIME
</p>
<p>OF WAR a war which involves in its dread issue the lives and interests of us all the
</p>
<p>guarantees of the Constitution are in full force for the benefit of those who conspire
</p>
<p>with the enemy, creep into your camps, murder in cold blood, in the interest of the
</p>
<p>invader or insurgent, the Commander-in-Chief of your army, and secure to him the slow
</p>
<p>and weak provisions of the civil law, while the soldier, who may, when overcome by
</p>
<p>the demands of exhausted nature which cannot be resisted, have slept at his post, is
</p>
<p>subject to be tried upon the spot by a military tribunal and shot. The argument

</p>
<p>amounts to this : that as military courts and military trials of civilians in time of war are
</p>
<p>a usurpation and tyranny, and as soldiers are liable to such arrests and trial, Sergeant
</p>
<p>Corbett, who shot Booth, should be tried and executed by sentence of a military court;
</p>
<p>while Booth's co-conspirators and aiders should be saved from any such indignity as a
</p>
<p>military trial ! I confess that I am too dull to comprehend the logic, the reason, or the
</p>
<p>sense of such a conclusion ! If there is any one entitled to this privilege of a civil trial
</p>
<p>at a remote period, and by a jury of the district, IN TIME OF CIVIL WAR, when the
</p>
<p>foundations of the republic are rocking beneath the earthquake tread of armed rebellion,
</p>
<p>that man is the defender of the republic. It will never do to say, as has been said in
</p>
<p>this argument, that the soldier is not liable to be tried in time of war by a military
</p>
<p>tribunal for any other offence than those prescribed in the rules and articles of war. To
</p>
<p>my mind, nothing can be clearer than that citizen and soldier alike, in time of civil or
</p>
<p>foreign war, after a proclamation of martial law, are triable by military tribunals for all
</p>
<p>offences of which they may be guilty, in the interests of, or in concert with the enemy.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 341
</p>
<p>These provisions, therefore, of your Constitution for indictment and trial by jury in
</p>
<p>civil courts of all crimes are, as I shall hereafter show, silent and inoperative in time of
</p>
<p>war when the public safety requires it.
</p>
<p>The argument to which I have thus been replying, as the court will not fail to
</p>
<p>perceive, nor that public to which the argument is addressed, is a labored attempt to
</p>
<p>establish the proposition, that, by the Constitution of the United States, the American
</p>
<p>people cannot, even in a civil war the greatest the world has ever seen, employ martial
</p>
<p>law and military tribunals as a means of successfully asserting their authority, preserving
</p>
<p>their nationality, and securing protection to the lives and property of all, and especially
</p>
<p>to the persons of those to whom they have committed, officially, the great trust of
</p>
<p>maintaining the national authority. The gentleman says, with an air of perfect con-
</p>
<p>fidence, that he denies the jurisdiction of military tribunals for the trial of civilians in
</p>
<p>time of war, because neither the Constitution nor laws justify, but on the contrary
</p>
<p>repudiate them, and that all the experience of the past is against it. I might content
</p>
<p>myself with saying that the practice of all nations is against the gentleman's conclusion.
</p>
<p>The struggle for our national independence was aided and prosecuted by military
</p>
<p>tribunals and martial law, as well as by arms. The contest for American nationality
</p>
<p>began with the establishment, very soon after the firing of the first gun at Lexington on
</p>
<p>the i gth day of April, 1775, of military tribunals and martial law. On the 3Oth of
</p>
<p>June, 1775, the Continental Congress provided that "whosoever, belonging to the con-
</p>
<p>tinental army, shall be convicted of holding correspondence with, or giving intelligence
</p>
<p>to the enemy, either indirectly or directly, shall suffer such punishment as by a court-
</p>
<p>martial shall be ordered." This was found not sufficient, inasmuch as it did not reach
</p>
<p>those civilians who, like certain civilians of our day, claim the protection of the civil
</p>
<p>law in time of war against military arrests and military trials for military crimes. There-
</p>
<p>fore the same Congress, on the 7th of November, 1775, amended this provision- by
</p>
<p>striking out the words " belonging to the continental army," and adopting the article as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>" All persons convicted of holding a treacherous correspondence with, or giving
</p>
<p>intelligence to the enemy, shall suffer death or such other punishment as a general court-
</p>
<p>martial shall think proper."
</p>
<p>And on the I7th of June, 1776, the Congress added an additional rule
</p>
<p>"That all persons not members of, nor owing allegiance to, any of the United
</p>
<p>States of America, who should be found lurking as spies in or about the fortifications or

</p>
<p>encampments of the armies of the United States, or any of them, shall suffer death,
</p>
<p>according to the law and usage of nations, by the sentence of a court-martial or such
</p>
<p>other punishment as a court-martial shall direct."
</p>
<p>Comprehensive as was this legislation, embracing as it did soldiers, citizens, and
</p>
<p>aliens, subjecting all alike to trial for their military tribunals of justice, according to the
</p>
<p>law and the usage of nations, it was found to be insufficient to meet that most dangerous
</p>
<p>of all crimes committed in the interests of the enemy by citizens in time of war the
</p>
<p>crime of conspiring together to assassinate or seize and carry away the soldiers and citi-
</p>
<p>zens who were loyal to the cause of the country. Therefore, on the 27th of February,
</p>
<p>1778, the Congress adopted the following resolution:
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That whatever inhabitant of these states shall kill, or seize, or take any loyal
</p>
<p>citizen or citizens thereof and convey him, her, or them to any place within the power
</p>
<p>of the enemy, or shall ENTER INTO ANY COMBINATION for such purpose, or attempt to
</p>
<p>carry the same into execution, or hath assisted or shall assist therein; or shall, by giving
</p>
<p>342 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>intelligence, acting as a guide, or in any manner whatever, aid the enemy in the per-
</p>
<p>petration thereof, he shall suffer death by the judgment of a court-martial as a traitor,
</p>
<p>assassin, or spy, if the offence be committed within seventy miles of the headquarters of
</p>
<p>the grand or other armies of these states where a general officer commands." Jour-
</p>
<p>nals of Congress, vol. ii, pp. 459, 460.
</p>
<p>So stood the law until the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. Every
</p>
<p>well-informed man knows that at the time of the passage of these acts the courts of
</p>
<p>justice, having cognizance of all crimes against persons, were open in many of the
</p>
<p>states, and that by their several constitutions and charters, which were then the supreme
</p>
<p>law for the punishment of crimes committed within their respective territorial limits, no
</p>
<p>man was liable to conviction but by the verdict of a jury. Take, for example, the pro-
</p>
<p>visions of the constitution of North Carolina, adopted on the loth of November, 1776,
</p>
<p>and in full force at the time of the passage of the last resolution by Congress above
</p>
<p>cited, which provisions are as follows :
</p>
<p>"That no freeman shall be put to answer any criminal charge but by indictment,
</p>
<p>presentment or impeachment."
</p>
<p>" That no freeman shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of
</p>
<p>a jury of good and lawful men in open court, as heretofore used."
</p>
<p>This was the law in 1778 in all the states, and the provision for a trial by jury every
</p>
<p>one knows meant a jury of twelve men, impanelled and qualified to try the issue in a
</p>
<p>civil court. The conclusion is not to be avoided, that these enactments of the Congress
</p>
<p>under the Confederation set aside the trial by jury within the several states, and expressly
</p>
<p>provided for the trial by court-martial of "any of the inhabitants" who, during the
</p>
<p>revolution, might, contrary to the provisions of said law, and in aid of the public
</p>
<p>enemy, give them intelligence, or kill any loyal citizens of the United States, or enter
</p>
<p>into any combination to kill or carry them away. How comes it, if the argument of
</p>
<p>the counsel be true, that this enactment was passed by the Congress of 1778, when the
</p>
<p>constitutions of the several states at that day as fully guaranteed trial by jury to every
</p>
<p>person held to answer for a crjme as does the Constitution of the United States at this
</p>
<p>hour? Notwithstanding this fact, I have yet to learn that any loyal man ever challenged,
</p>
<p>during all the period of our conflict for independence and nationality, the validity of
</p>
<p>that law for the trial, for military offences, by military tribunals, of all offenders, as the
</p>
<p>law, not of peace, but of war, and absolutely essential to the prosecution of war. I
</p>
<p>may be pardoned for saying that it is the accepted common law of nations, that mar-

</p>
<p>tial law is, at all times and everywhere, essential to the successful prosecution of war,
</p>
<p>whether it be a civil or a foreign war. The validity of these acts of the Continental and
</p>
<p>Confederate Congress I know was challenged, but only by men charged with the guilt
</p>
<p>of their country's blood.
</p>
<p>Washington, the peerless, the stainless, and the just, with whom God walked
</p>
<p>through the night of that great trial, enforced this just and wise enactment upon all
</p>
<p>occasions. On the 3<Dth of September, 1780, Joshua H. Smith, by the order of General
</p>
<p>Washington, was put upon his trial before a court-martial, convened in the State of
</p>
<p>New York, on the charge of there aiding and assisting Benedict Arnold, in a combina-
</p>
<p>tion with the enemy, to take, kill, and seize such loyal citizens or soldiers of the United
</p>
<p>States as were in garrison at West Point. Smith objected to the jurisdiction, averring
</p>
<p>that he was a private citizen, not in the military or naval service, and therefore was only
</p>
<p>amenable to the civil authority of the State, whose constitution had guaranteed the
</p>
<p>right of trial by jury to all persons held to answer for crime. (" Chandler's Criminal
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 343
</p>
<p>Trials," vol. 2, p. 187.) The constitution of New York then in force had so provided;
</p>
<p>but, notwithstanding that, the court overruled the plea, held him to answer, and tried
</p>
<p>him. I repeat, that when Smith was thus tried by court-martial the constitution of
</p>
<p>New York as fully guaranteed trial by jury in the civil courts to all civilians charged and
</p>
<p>held to answer for crimes within the limits of that State as does the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States guarantee such trial within the limits of the District of Columbia. By the
</p>
<p>second of the Articles of Confederation each State retained " its sovereignty," and every
</p>
<p>power, jurisdiction, and right not expressly delegated to the United States in Congress
</p>
<p>assembled. By those articles there was no express delegation of judicial power;
</p>
<p>therefore the States retained it fully.
</p>
<p>If the military courts, constituted by the commander of the army of the United
</p>
<p>States under the Confederation, who was appointed only by a resolution of the
</p>
<p>Congress, without any express grant of power to authorize it his office not being
</p>
<p>created by the act of the people in their fundamental law had jurisdiction in every
</p>
<p>State to try and put to death "any inhabitant" thereof who should kill any loyal
</p>
<p>citizen or enter into "any combination" for any such purpose therein in time of war,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution and laws of such States, how can any
</p>
<p>man conceive that under the Constitution of the United States, which is the supreme law
</p>
<p>over every State, anything in the constitution and laws of such State to the contrary
</p>
<p>notwithstanding, and the supreme law over every territory of the republic as well, the
</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief of the army of the United States, who is made such by the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution, and by its supreme authority clothed with the power and charged with the duty
</p>
<p>of directing and controlling the 'whole military power of the United States in time of
</p>
<p>rebellion or invasion, has not that authority?
</p>
<p>I need not remind the court that one of the marked differences between the Articles
</p>
<p>of Confederation and the Constitution of the United States was, that under the Confed-
</p>
<p>eration the Congress was the sole depository of all federal power. The Congress of
</p>
<p>the Confederation, said Madison, held " the command of the army." (Fed., No. 38.)
</p>
<p>Has the Constitution, which was ordained by the people the better " to insure domestic
</p>
<p>tranquillity and to provide for the common defence," so fettered the great power of
</p>
<p>self-defence against armed insurrection or invasion that martial law, so essential in war,
</p>
<p>is forbidden by that great instrument? I will yield to no man in reverence for or
</p>
<p>obedience to the Constitution of my country, esteeming it, as I do, a new evangel to the
</p>
<p>nations, embodying the democracy of the New Testament the absolute equality of all

<p>men before the law, in respect of those rights of human nature which are the gift of
</p>
<p>God, and therefore as universal as the material structure of man. Can it be that this
</p>
<p>Constitution of ours, so divine in its spirit of justice, so beneficent in its results, so full
</p>
<p>of wisdom and goodness and truth, under which we became one people, a great and
</p>
<p>powerful nationality, has in terms or by implication denied to this people the power to
</p>
<p>crush armed rebellion by war, and to arrest and punish, during the existence of such
</p>
<p>rebellion, according to the laws of war and the usages of nations, secret conspirators
</p>
<p>who aid and abet the public enemy?
</p>
<p>Here is a conspiracy, organized and prosecuted by armed traitors and hired assassins,
</p>
<p>receiving the moral support of thousands in every State and district, who pronounced
</p>
<p>the war for the Union a failure, and your now murdered but immortal Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief a tyrant; the object of which conspiracy, as the testimony shows, was to aid the
</p>
<p>tottering rebellion which struck at the nation's life. It is in evidence that Davis,
</p>
<p>Thompson, and others, chiefs in this rebellion, in aid of the same, agreed and conspired
</p>
<p>344 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>with others to poison the fountains of water which supply your commercial metropolis,
</p>
<p>and thereby murder its inhabitants; to secretly deposit in the habitations of the people
</p>
<p>and in the ships in your harbors inflammable materials, and thereby destroy them by
</p>
<p>fire; to murder by the slow and consuming torture of famine your soldiers, captive in
</p>
<p>their hands; to import pestilence in infected clothes to be distributed in your capital
</p>
<p>and camps, and thereby murder the surviving heroes and defender of the republic, who,
</p>
<p>standing by the holy graves of your unreturning brave, proudly and defiantly challenge
</p>
<p>to honorable combat and open battle all public enemies, that their country may live;
</p>
<p>and finally, to crown this horrid catalogue of crime, this sum of all human atrocities,
</p>
<p>conspired, as charged upon your record, with the accused and John Wilkes Booth and
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt, to kill and murder in your capital the executive officers of your gov-
</p>
<p>ernment and the commander of your armies. When this conspiracy, entered into by
</p>
<p>these traitors, is revealed by its attempted execution, and the foul and brutal murder of
</p>
<p>your President in the capital, you are told that it is unconstitutional, in order to arrest
</p>
<p>the further execution of the conspiracy, to interpose the military power of this govern-
</p>
<p>ment for the arrest, without civil process, of any of the parties thereto, and for their
</p>
<p>trial by a military tribunal of justice. If any such rule had obtained during our struggle
</p>
<p>for independence we never would have been a nation. If any such rule had been
</p>
<p>adopted and acted upon now, during the fierce struggle of the past four years no man
</p>
<p>can say that our nationality would have thus long survived.
</p>
<p>The whole people of the United States by their Constitution have created the office
</p>
<p>of President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy, and
</p>
<p>have vested, by the terms of that Constitution, in the person of the President and Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief, the power to enforce the execution of the laws, and preserve, protect,
</p>
<p>and defend the Constitution.
</p>
<p>The question may well be asked : If, as Commander-in-Chief, the President may not,
</p>
<p>in time of insurrection or war, proclaim and execute martial law, according to the usages
</p>
<p>of nations, how he can successfully perform the duties of his office execute the laws,
</p>
<p>preserve the Constitution, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion?
</p>
<p>Martial law and military tribunals are as essential to the successful prosecution of
</p>
<p>war as are men and arms and munitions. The Constitution of the United States has
</p>
<p>vested the power to declare war and raise armies and navies exclusively in the Congress,
</p>
<p>and the power to prosecute the war and command the army and navy exclusively in the
</p>
<p>President of the United States. As, under the Confederation, the commander of the

<p>army, appointed only by the Congress, was by the resolution of that Congress empowered
</p>
<p>to act as he might think proper for the good and welfare of the ser.vice, subject only to
</p>
<p>such restraints or orders as the Congress might give, so, under the Constitution, the
</p>
<p>President is, by the people who ordained that Constitution and declared him Commander-
</p>
<p>in-Chief of the army and navy, vested with full power to direct and control the army
</p>
<p>and navy of the United States, and employ all the forces necessary to preserve, protect,
</p>
<p>and defend the Constitution and execute the laws, as enjoined by his oath and the very
</p>
<p>letter of the Constitution, subject to no restriction or direction save such as Congress
</p>
<p>may from time to time prescribe.
</p>
<p>That these powers for the common defence, intrusted by the Constitution exclusively
</p>
<p>to the Congress and the President, are, in time of civil war or foreign invasion, to be
</p>
<p>exercised without limitation or restraint, to the extent of the public necessity, and with-
</p>
<p>out any intervention of the federal judiciary or of State constitutions or State laws, are
</p>
<p>facts in our history not open to question.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 345
</p>
<p>The position is not to be answered by saying you make the American Congress
</p>
<p>thereby omnipotent, and clothe the American Executive with the asserted attribute of
</p>
<p>hereditary monarchy the king can do no wrong. Let the position be fairly stated
</p>
<p>that the Congress and President, in war as in peace, are but the agents of the whole
</p>
<p>people, and that this unlimited power for the common defence against armed rebellion
</p>
<p>or foreign invasion is but the power of the people intrusted exclusively to the legislative
</p>
<p>and executive departments as their agents, for any and every abuse of which these
</p>
<p>agents are directly responsible to the people and the demagogue cry of an omnipo-
</p>
<p>tent Congress, and an Executive invested with royal prerogatives, vanishes like the
</p>
<p>baseless fabric of a vision. If the Congress, corruptly or oppressively, or wantonly
</p>
<p>abuse this great trust, the people, by the irresistible power of the ballot, hurl them from
</p>
<p>place. If the President so abuse the trust, the people by their Congress withhold sup-
</p>
<p>plies, or by impeachment transfer the trust to better hands, strip him of the franchises
</p>
<p>of citizenship and of office, and declare him forever disqualified to hold any position of
</p>
<p>honor, trust, or power, under the government of his country.
</p>
<p>I can understand very well why men should tremb.le at the exercise of this great
</p>
<p>power by a monarch whose person, by the constitution of his realm, is inviolable, but I
</p>
<p>cannot conceive how any American citizen, who has faith in the capacity of the whole
</p>
<p>people to govern themselves, should give himself any concern on the subject. Mr.
</p>
<p>Hallam, the distinguished author of the Constitutional History of England, has said:
</p>
<p>" Kings love to display the divinity with which their flatterers invest them in nothing
</p>
<p>so much as in the instantaneous execution of their will, and to stand revealed, as it
</p>
<p>were, in the storm and thunderbolt when their power breaks through the operation of
</p>
<p>secondary causes and awes a prostate nation without the intervention of law."
</p>
<p>How just are such words when applied to an irresponsible monarch ! how absurd
</p>
<p>when applied to a whole people, acting through their duly appointed agents, whose will,
</p>
<p>thus declared, is the supreme law, to awe into submission and peace and obedience, not
</p>
<p>a prostrate nation, but a prostrate rebellion ! The same great author utters the fact
</p>
<p>which all history attests, when he says :
</p>
<p>" It has been usual for all governments during actual rebellion to proclaim martial
</p>
<p>law for the suspension of civil jurisdiction; and this anomaly, I must admit," he adds,
</p>
<p>" is very far from being less indispensable at such unhappy seasons where the ordinary
</p>
<p>mode of trial is by jury than where the right of decision resides in the court." Const.

<p>That the power to proclaim martial law and fully or partially suspend the civil juris-
</p>
<p>diction, federal and state, in time of rebellion or civil war, and punish by military tribu-
</p>
<p>nals all offences committed in aid of the public enemy, is conferred upon Congress and
</p>
<p>the Executive, necessarily results from the unlimited grants of power for the common
</p>
<p>defence to which I have already briefly referred. I may be pardoned for saying that
</p>
<p>this position is not assumed by me for the purposes of this occasion, but that early in the
</p>
<p>first year of this great struggle for our national life I proclaimed it as a representative of
</p>
<p>the people, under the obligation of my oath, and, as I then believed and still believe,
</p>
<p>upon the authority of the great men who formed and fashioned the wise and majestic
</p>
<p>fabric of American government.
</p>
<p>Some of the citations which I deemed it my duty at that time to make, and some of
</p>
<p>which I now reproduce, have, I am pleased to say, found a wider circulation in books
</p>
<p>that have since been published by others.
</p>
<p>When the Constitution was on trial for its deliverance before the people of the
</p>
<p>346 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>several States, its ratification was opposed on the ground that it conferred upon Congress
</p>
<p>and the Executive unlimited power for the common defence. To all such objectors
</p>
<p>and they were numerous in every State that great man, Alexander Hamilton, whose
</p>
<p>words will live as long as our language lives, speaking to the listening people of all the
</p>
<p>States and urging them not to reject that matchless instrument which bore the name of
</p>
<p>Washington, said :
</p>
<p>' ' The authorities essential to the care of the common defence are these : To raise
</p>
<p>armies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for the government of both; to.
</p>
<p>direct their operations; to provide for their support. These powers ought to exist
</p>
<p>WITHOUT LIMITATION; because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and vari-
</p>
<p>ety of national exigencies, and the correspondent extent and variety of the means which
</p>
<p>may be necessary to satisfy them.
</p>
<p>"The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite; and for this
</p>
<p>reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care
</p>
<p>of it is committed. . . . This power ought to be under the direction of the same
</p>
<p>councils which are appointed to preside over the common defence. ... It must be
</p>
<p>admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority
</p>
<p>which is to provide for the defence and protection of the community in any manner
</p>
<p>essential to its efficacy; that is, in any matter essential to the formation, direction, or
</p>
<p>support of the national forces."
</p>
<p>He adds the further remark: "This is one of those truths which, to a correct and
</p>
<p>unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it; and may be obscured, but
</p>
<p>cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests upon axioms as simple as
</p>
<p>they are universal the means ought to be proportioned to the end; the persons from
</p>
<p>whose agency the attainment of any end is expected ought to possess the means by
</p>
<p>which it is to be attained." Federalist, No. 23.
</p>
<p>In the same great contest for the adoption of the Constitution, Madison, sometimes
</p>
<p>called the " Father of the Constitution," said:
</p>
<p>" Is the power of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this question in the
</p>
<p>negative. ... Is the power of raising armies and equipping fleets necessary?
</p>
<p>. . . It is involved in the power of self-defence. . . . With what color of propri-
</p>
<p>ety could the force necessary for defence be limited by those who cannot limit the force
</p>
<p>of offence? . . . The means of security can only be regulated by the means and
</p>
<p>the danger of attack. . . . It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the

<p>impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain, because it plants in the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution itself necessary usurpations of power." Federalist, No. 41.
</p>
<p>With this construction, proclaimed both by the advocates and opponents of its rati-
</p>
<p>fication, the Constitution of the United States was accepted and adopted, and that con-
</p>
<p>struction has been followed and acted upon by every department of the government to
</p>
<p>this day.
</p>
<p>It was as well understood then in theory as it has since been illustrated in practice,
</p>
<p>that the judicial power, both federal and State, had no voice and could exercise no
</p>
<p>authority in the conduct and prosecution of a war, except in subordination to the politi-
</p>
<p>cal department of the government. The Constitution contains the significant provision,
</p>
<p>" The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases
</p>
<p>of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."
</p>
<p>What was this but a declaration, that in time of rebellion or invasion the public
</p>
<p>safety is the highest law? that so far as necessary the civil courts (of which the Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief, under the direction of Congress, shall be the sole judge) must be
</p>
<p>silent, and the rights of each citizen, as secured in time of peace, must yield to the
</p>
<p>wants, interests, and necessities of the nation? Yet we have been gravely told by the

<p>gentleman in his argument, that the maxim, salus populi supremo, est lex, is but fit for
</p>
<p>a tyrant's use. Those grand men, whom God taught to build the fabric of empire,
</p>
<p>thought otherwise when they put that maxim into the Constitution of their country.
</p>
<p>It is very clear that the Constitution recognizes the great principle which underlies the
</p>
<p>structure of society and of all civil government; that no man lives for himself alone,
</p>
<p>but each for all; that, if need be, some must die that the State may live, because at
</p>
<p>best the individual is but for to-day, while the commonwealth is for all time. I agree
</p>
<p>with the gentleman in the maxim which he borrows from Aristotle, " Let the public
</p>
<p>weal be under the protection of the law "; but I claim that in war, as in peace, by the
</p>
<p>very terms of the Constitution of the country, the public safety is under the protection
</p>
<p>of the law; that the Constitution itself has provided for the declaration of war for
</p>
<p>the common defense, to suppress rebellion, to repel invasion, and, by express terms,
</p>
<p>has declared that whatever is necessary to make the prosecution of the war successful,
</p>
<p>may be done, and ought to be done, and is therefore constitutionally lawful.
</p>
<p>Who will dare to say that in time of civil war " no person shall be deprived of
</p>
<p>life, liberty, and property without due process of law"? This is a provision of your
</p>
<p>Constitution than which there is none more just or sacred in it; it is, however, only
</p>
<p>the law of peace, not of war. In peace, that wise provision of the Constitution must
</p>
<p>be, and is, enforced by the civil courts; in war it must be, and is, to a great extent,
</p>
<p>inoperative and disregarded. The thousands slain by your armies in battle were
</p>
<p>deprived of life "without due process of law." All spies arrested, convicted, and
</p>
<p>executed by your military tribunals in time of war are deprived of liberty and life
</p>
<p>" without due process of law " all enemies captured and held as prisoners of war are
</p>
<p>deprived of liberty "without due process of law"; all owners whose property is
</p>
<p>forcibly seized and appropriated in war are deprived of their property "without due
</p>
<p>process of law." The Constitution recognizes the principle of common law, that every
</p>
<p>man's house is his castle; that his home, the shelter of his wife and children, is his
</p>
<p>most sacred possession; and has therefore specially provided, " that no soldier shall
</p>
<p>in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of its owner, nor in
</p>
<p>time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law [III Amend.]; thereby declar-
</p>
<p>ing that, in time of war, Congress may by law authorize, as it has done, that without
</p>
<p>the consent and against the consent of the owner, the soldier may be quartered in any
</p>
<p>man's house and upon any man's hearth. What I have said illustrates the proposition,
</p>
<p>that in time of war the civil tribunals of justice are wholly or partially silent, as the

</p>
<p>public safety may require; that the limitations and provisions of the Constitution in
</p>
<p>favor of life, liberty, and property are therefore wholly or partially suspended. In
</p>
<p>this I am sustained by an authority second to none with intelligent American citizens.
</p>
<p>Mr. John Quincy Adams, than whom a purer man or a wiser statesman never ascended
</p>
<p>the chair of the chief magistracy in America, said in his place in the House of Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives, in 1836, that:
</p>
<p>" In the authority given to Congress by the Constitution of the United States to
</p>
<p>declare war, all the powers incident to war are by necessary implication conferred upon
</p>
<p>the government of the United States. Now the powers incidental to war are derived,
</p>
<p>not from their internal municipal source, but from the laws and usages of nations.
</p>
<p>There are, then, in the authority of Congress and the Executive, two classes of powers
</p>
<p>altogether different in their nature and often incompatible with each other the war
</p>
<p>power and the peace power. The peace power is limited by regulations and restricted
</p>
<p>by provisions prescribed within the Constitution itself. The war power is limited only
</p>
<p>by the laws and usage of nations. This power is tremendous; it is strictly constitu-
</p>
<p>tional, but it breaks down every barrier so anxiously erected for the protection of lib-
</p>
<p>erty, of property, and of life."
</p>
<p>348 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>If this be so, how can there be trial by jury for military offenses in time of civil
</p>
<p>war? If you cannot, and do not, try the armed enemy before you shoot him, or the
</p>
<p>captured enemy before you imprison him, why should you be held to open the civil
</p>
<p>courts and try the spy, the conspirator, and the assassin, in the secret service of the
</p>
<p>public enemy, by jury, before you convict and punish him? Why not clamor against
</p>
<p>holding imprisoned the captured armed rebels, deprived of their liberty without due
</p>
<p>process of law? Are they not citizens? Why not clamor against slaying for their
</p>
<p>crime of treason, which is cognizable in the civil courts, by your rifled ordnance and
</p>
<p>the leaden hail of your musketry in battle, these public enemies, without trial by jury?
</p>
<p>Are they not citizens? Why is the clamor confined exclusively to the trial by military
</p>
<p>tribunals of justice of traitorous spies, traitorous conspirators, and assassins hired to do
</p>
<p>secretly what the armed rebel attempts to do openly murder your nationality by
</p>
<p>assassinating its defenders and its executive officers? Nothing can be clearer than that
</p>
<p>the rebel captured prisoner, being a citizen of the republic, is as much entitled to trial
</p>
<p>by jury before he is committed to prison, as the spy, or the aider and abetter of the
</p>
<p>treason by conspiracy and assassination, being a citizen, is entitled to such trial by jury,
</p>
<p>before he is subjected to the just punishment of the law for his great crime. I think
</p>
<p>that in time of war the remark of Montesquieu, touching the civil judiciary is true :
</p>
<p>that "it is next to nothing." Hamilton well said, "The Executive holds the sword of
</p>
<p>the community; the judiciary has no direction of the strength of society; it has neither
</p>
<p>force nor will; it has judgment alone, and is dependent for the execution of that upon
</p>
<p>the arm of the Executive." The people of these States so understood the Constitution
</p>
<p>and adopted it, and intended thereby, without limitation or restraint, to empower their
</p>
<p>Congress and Executive to authorize by law, and execute by force, whatever the public
</p>
<p>safety might require to suppress rebellion or repel invasion.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all that has been said by the counsel for the accused to the con-
</p>
<p>trary, the Constitution has received this construction from the day of its adoption to
</p>
<p>this hour. The Supreme Court of the United States has solemnly decided that the
</p>
<p>Constitution has conferred upon the government authority to employ all the means
</p>
<p>necessary to the faithful execution of all the powers which that Constitution enjoins
</p>
<p>upon the government of the United States, and upon every department and every
</p>
<p>officer thereof. Speaking of that provision of the Constitution which provides that
</p>
<p>"Congress shall have power to make all laws that may be necessary and proper to
</p>
<p>carry into effect all powers granted to the government of the United States, or to any

<p>department or officer thereof," Chief Justice Marshall, in his great decision in the case
</p>
<p>of McCulloch vs. State of Maryland, says :
</p>
<p>"The powers given to the government imply the ordinary means of execution, and
</p>
<p>the government, in all sound reason and fair interpretation, must have the choice of
</p>
<p>the means which it deems the most convenient and appropriate to the execution of the
</p>
<p>power. . . . The powers of the government were given for the welfare of the
</p>
<p>nation; they were intended to endure for ages to come, and to be adapted to the vari-
</p>
<p>ous crises in human affairs. To prescribe the specific means by which government
</p>
<p>should, in all future time, execute its power, and to confine the choice of means to
</p>
<p>such narrow limits as should not leave it in the power of Congress to adopt any which
</p>
<p>might be appropriate and conducive to the end, would be most unwise and pernicious."
</p>

</p>
<p>Words fitly spoken ! which illAstrated at the time of their utterance the wisdom of
</p>
<p>the Constitution in providing this general grant of power to meet every possible exi-
</p>
<p>gency which the fortunes of war might cast upon the country, and the wisdom of

<p>APPENDIX. 349
</p>
<p>which words, in turn, has been illustrated to-day by the gigantic and triumphant strug-
</p>
<p>gle of the people during the last four years for the supremacy of the Constitution, and
</p>
<p>in exact accordance with its provisions. In the light of these wonderful events, the
</p>
<p>words of Pinckney, uttered when the illustrious Chief Justice had concluded this opin-
</p>
<p>ion, "The Constitution of my country is immortal! " seem to have become words of
</p>
<p>prophecy. Has not this great tribunal, through the chief of all its judges, by this
</p>
<p>luminous and profound reasoning, declared that the government may by law authorize
</p>
<p>the Executive to employ, in the prosecution of war, the ordinary means, and all the
</p>
<p>means necessary and adapted to the end? And in the other decision before referred
</p>
<p>to, in the 8th of Cranch, arising during the late war with Great Britain, Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Story said :
</p>
<p>" When the legislative authority, to whom the right to declare war is confided, has
</p>
<p>declared war in its most unlimited manner, the executive authority, to whom the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of the war is confided, is bound to carry it into effect. He has a discretion vested
</p>
<p>in him as to the manner and extent, but he cannot lawfully transcend the rules of
</p>
<p>warfare established among civilized nations. He cannot lawfully exercise powers or
</p>
<p>authorize proceedings which the civilized world repudiates and disclaims. The sov-
</p>
<p>ereignty, as to declaring war and limiting its effects, rests with the legislature. The
</p>
<p>sovereignty as to its execution rests with the President. Brown vs. United States,
</p>
<p>8 Cranch, 153.
</p>
<p>Has the Congress, to whom is committed the sovereignty of the whole people to
</p>
<p>declare war, by legislation restricted the President, or attempted to restrict him, in the
</p>
<p>prosecution of this war for the Union, from exercising all the " powers " and adopting
</p>
<p>all the " proceedings" usually approved and employed by the civilized world? He
</p>
<p>would, in my judgment, be a bold man who asserted that Congress has so legis-
</p>
<p>lated; and the Congress which should by law fetter the executive arm when raised for
</p>
<p>the common defense would, in my opinion, be false to their oath. That Congress may
</p>
<p>prescribe rules for the government of the army and navy and the militia when in actual
</p>
<p>service, by articles of war, is an express grant of power in the Constitution which Con-
</p>
<p>gress has rightfully exercised, and which the Executive must and does obey. That
</p>
<p>Congress may aid the Executive by legislation in the prosecution of a war, civil or
</p>
<p>foreign, is admitted. That Congress may restrain the Executive, and arraign, try, and
</p>
<p>condemn him for wantonly abusing the great trust, is expressly declared in the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution. That Congress shall pass all laws NECESSARY to enable the Executive to exe-

</p>
<p>cute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion, is one of the
</p>
<p>express requirements of the Constitution, for the performance of which the Congress
</p>
<p>is bound by an oath.
</p>
<p>What was the legislation of Congress when treason fired its first gun on Sumter?
</p>
<p>By the act of 1795 it is provided that whenever the laws of the United States shall be
</p>
<p>opposed, or the execution thereof obstructed, in any State, by combinations too power-
</p>
<p>ful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding or by the powers
</p>
<p>vested in the marshals, it shall be lawful by this act for the President to call forth the
</p>
<p>militia of such State, or of any other State or States, as may be necessary to suppress
</p>
<p>such combinations and to cause the laws to be executed (ist Statutes at Large, 424).
</p>
<p>By the act of 1807 it is provided that in case of insurrection or obstruction to the laws,
</p>
<p>either of the United States or of any individual State or territory, where it is lawful
</p>
<p>for the President of the United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of sup-
</p>
<p>pressing such insurrection or of causing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be law-
</p>
<p>350 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>ful for him to employ for such purpose such part of the land or naval forces of the
</p>
<p>United States as shall be judged necessary (ad Statutes at Large, 443).
</p>
<p>Can any one doubt that by these acts the President is clothed with full power to
</p>
<p>determine whether armed insurrection exists in any State or territory of the Union;
</p>
<p>and if so, to make war upon it with all the force he may deem necessary or be able to
</p>
<p>command? By the simple exercise of this great power it necessarily results that he
</p>
<p>may, in the prosecution of the war for the suppression of such insurrection, suspend
</p>
<p>as far as may be necessary the civil administration of justice by substituting in its stead
</p>
<p>martial law, which is simply the common law of war. If in such a moment the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident may make no arrests without civil warrant, and may inflict no violence or penal-
</p>
<p>ties on persons (as is claimed here for the accused), without first obtaining the verdict
</p>
<p>of juries and the judgment of civil courts, then is this legislation a mockery, and the
</p>
<p>Constitution, which not only authorized but enjoined its enactment, but a glittering
</p>
<p>generality and a splendid bauble. Happily, the Supreme Court has settled all contro-
</p>
<p>versy on this question. In speaking of the Rhode Island insurrection, the court say:
</p>
<p>"The Constitution of the United States, as far as it has provided for an emergency
</p>
<p>of this kind and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic con-
</p>
<p>cerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature and placed the power
</p>
<p>in the hands of that department." . . . "By the act of 1795 the power of decid-
</p>
<p>ing whether the exigency has arisen upon which the government of the United States
</p>
<p>is bound to interfere is given to the President."
</p>
<p>The court add :
</p>
<p>"When the President has acted and called out the militia, is a circuit court of the
</p>
<p>United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right ? If it could, then
</p>
<p>it would become the duty of the court, provided it came to the conclusion that the
</p>
<p>President had decided incorrectly, to discharge those who were arrested or detained by
</p>
<p>the troops in the service of the United States." . . . "If the judicial power
</p>
<p>extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a
</p>
<p>guarantee of anarchy and not of order." ..." Yet if this right does not reside
</p>
<p>in the courts when the conflict is raging, if the judicial power is at that time bound to
</p>
<p>follow the decision of the political, it must be equally bound when the contest is over.
</p>
<p>It cannot, when peace is restored, punish as offenses and crimes the acts which it
</p>
<p>before recognized and was bound to recognize as lawful." Luther vs. Borden, 7
</p>
<p>Howard, 42, 43.

<p>If this be law, what becomes of the volunteer advice of the volunteer counsel, by
</p>
<p>him given without money and without price, to this court, of their responsibility
</p>
<p>their personal responsibility, for obeying the orders of the President of the United
</p>
<p>States in trying persons accused of the murder of the Chief Magistrate and Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief of the army and navy of the United States in time of rebellion, and
</p>
<p>in pursuance of a conspiracy entered into with the public enemy? I may be pardoned
</p>
<p>for asking the attention of the court to a further citation from this important decision,
</p>
<p>in which the court say, the employment of military power to put down an armed insur-
</p>
<p>rection "is essential to the existence of every government, and is as necessary to the
</p>
<p>States of this Union as to any other government; and if the government of the State
</p>
<p>deem the armed opposition so formidable as to require the use of military force and
</p>
<p>the declaration of MARTIAL LAW, we see no ground upon which this court can question
</p>
<p>its authority" (//>/</). This decision in terms declared that under the act of 1795
</p>
<p>the President had power to decide and did decide the question so as to exclude further
</p>
<p>inquiry whether the State government which thus employed force and proclaimed
</p>
<p>martial law was the government of the State, and therefore was permitted to act. If
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 351
</p>
<p>a State may do this to put down armed insurrection, may not the federal government
</p>
<p>as well? The reason of the man who doubts it may justly lie questioned. I but quote
</p>
<p>the language of that tribunal, in another case before cited, when I say the Constitution
</p>
<p>confers upon the President the whole executive power.
</p>
<p>We have seen that the proclamation of blockade made by the President was
</p>
<p>affirmed by the Supreme Court as a lawful and valid act, although its direct effect was
</p>
<p>to dispose of the property of whoever violated it, whether citizen or stranger. It is
</p>
<p>difficult to perceive what course of reasoning can be adopted, in the light of that
</p>
<p>decision, which will justify any man in saying that the President had not the like
</p>
<p>power to proclaim martial law in time of insurrection against the United States, and ta
</p>
<p>establish, according to the customs of war among civilized nations, military tribunals
</p>
<p>of justice for its enforcement and for the punishment of all crimes committed in the
</p>
<p>interests of the public enemy.
</p>
<p>These acts of the President have, however, all been legalized by the subsequent
</p>
<p>legislation of Congress, although the Supreme Court decided, in relation to the procla-
</p>
<p>mation of blockade, that no such legislation was necessary. By the act of August 6 t
</p>
<p>1861, ch. 63, sec. 3, it is enacted that
</p>
<p>"All the acts, proclamations, and orders of the President of the United States,
</p>
<p>after the 4th of March, 1861, respecting the army and navy of the United States, and
</p>
<p>calling out, or relating to, the militia or volunteers from the States, are hereby approved
</p>
<p>in all respects, legalized, and made valid to the same extent and with the same effect
</p>
<p>as if they had been issued and done under the previous express authority and direc-
</p>
<p>ion of the Congress of the United States." 12 Statutes at Large, 326.
</p>
<p>This act legalized, if any such legalization was necessary, all that the President had
</p>
<p>done from the day of his inauguration to that hour, in the prosecution of the war for
</p>
<p>the Union. He had suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and resisted
</p>
<p>its execution when issued by the Chief Justice of the United States; he had called out
</p>
<p>and accepted the services of a large body of volunteers for a period not previously
</p>
<p>authorized by law; he had declared a blockade of the Southern ports; he had declared
</p>
<p>the Southern States in insurrection; he had ordered the armies to invade them and
</p>
<p>suppress it; thus exercising, ih accordance with the laws of war, power over the life,
</p>
<p>the liberty, and the property of the citizens. Congress ratified it and affirmed it.
</p>
<p>In like manner and by subsequent legislation did the Congress ratify and affirm the
</p>
<p>proclamation of martial law of September 25, 1862. That proclamation, as the court

</p>
<p>will have observed, declares that during the existing insurrection all rebels and insur-
</p>
<p>gents, their aiders and abettors within the United States, and all persons guilty of any
</p>
<p>disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to the rebels against the authority of the
</p>
<p>United States, shall be subject to martial law and liable to trial and punishment by
</p>
<p>courts-martial or military commission ; and second, that the writ of habeas corpus is
</p>
<p>suspended in respect to all persons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the
</p>
<p>rebellion shall be, imprisoned in any fort, etc., by any military authority, or by the
</p>
<p>sentence of any court-martial or military commission.
</p>
<p>One would suppose that it needed no argument to satisfy an intelligent and patriotic
</p>
<p>citizen of the United States that, by the ruling of the Supreme Court cited, so much of
</p>
<p>this proclamation as declares that all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors,
</p>
<p>shall be subject to martial law and be liable to trial and punishment by court-martial or
</p>
<p>military commission, needed no ratification by Congress. Every step that the President
</p>
<p>took against rebels and insurgents was taken in pursuance of the rules of war and was
</p>
<p>35 2 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>an exercise of martial law. Who says that he should not deprive them, by the author-
</p>
<p>ity of this law, of life and liberty? Are the aiders and abettors of these insurgents
</p>
<p>entitled to any higher consideration than the armed insurgents themselves? It is
</p>
<p>against these that the President proclaimed martial law, and against all others who were
</p>
<p>guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority
</p>
<p>of the United States. Against these he suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas
</p>
<p>corpus ; and these, and only such as these, were by that proclamation-subjected to trial
</p>
<p>and punishment by court-martial or military commission.
</p>
<p>That the Proclamation covers the offense charged here, no man will, or darej for a
</p>
<p>moment deny. Was it not a disloyal practice? Was it not aiding and abetting the
</p>
<p>insurgents and rebels to enter into a conspiracy with them to kill and murder, within
</p>
<p>your capital and your intrenched camp, the Commander-in-Chief of our army, your
</p>
<p>Lieutenant General, and the Vice-President, and the Secretary of State, with intent
</p>
<p>thereby to aid the rebellion, and subvert the Constitution and laws of the United
</p>
<p>States? But it is said that the President could not establish a court for their trial, and
</p>
<p>therefore Congress must ratify and affirm this Proclamation. I have said before that
</p>
<p>such an argument comes with ill grace from the lips of him who declared as solemnly
</p>
<p>that neither by the Congress nor by the President could either the rebel himself or his
</p>
<p>aider or abettor be lawfully and constitutionally subjected to trial by any military tribu-
</p>
<p>nal, whether court-martial or military commission. But the Congress did ratify, in the
</p>
<p>exercise of the power vested in them, every part of this Proclamation. I have said,
</p>
<p>upon the authority of the fathers of the Constitution, and of its judicial interpreters,
</p>
<p>that Congress has power by legislation to aid the Executive in the suppression of rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, in executing the laws of the Union when resisted by armed insurrection, and in
</p>
<p>repelling invasion.
</p>
<p>By the act of March 3, 1863, the Congress of the United States, by the first section
</p>
<p>thereof, declared that during the present rebellion the President of the United States,
</p>
<p>whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the
</p>
<p>writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States or any part thereof.
</p>
<p>By the fourth section of the same act it is declared that any order of the President, or
</p>
<p>under his authority, made at any time during the existence of the present rebellion,
</p>
<p>shall be a defense in all courts to any action or prosecution, civil or criminal, pend-
</p>
<p>ing or to be commenced, for any search, seizure, arrest, or imprisonment, made, done,
</p>
<p>or committed, or acts omitted to be done, under and by virtue of such order. By the

<p>fifth section it is provided that, if any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, has been or

<p>shall be commenced in any State court against any officer, civil or military, or against
</p>
<p>any other person, for any arrest or imprisonment made, or other trespasses or wrongs
</p>
<p>done or committed, or any act omitted to be done at any time during the present rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, by virture of or under color of any authority derived from or exercised by or
</p>
<p>under the President of the United States, if the defendant shall, upon appearance in
</p>
<p>such court, file a petition stating the facts upon affidavit, etc., as aforesaid, for the
</p>
<p>removal of the cause for trial to the circuit court of the United States, it shall be the
</p>
<p>duty of the State court, upon his giving security, to proceed no further in the cause or
</p>
<p>prosecution; thus declaring that all orders of the President, made at any time during
</p>
<p>the existence of the present rebellion, and all acts done in pursuance thereof, shall be
</p>
<p>held valid in the courts of justice. Without further inquiry, these provisions of this
</p>
<p>statute embrace Order 141, which is the proclamation of martial law, and necessarily
</p>
<p>legalize every act done under it, either before the passage of the act of 1863 or since.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 353
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as that Proclamation ordered that all rebels, insurgents, their aiders and
</p>
<p>abettors, and persons guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to rebels
</p>
<p>against the authority of the United States, at any time during the existing insurrection,
</p>
<p>should be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and punishment by a military com-
</p>
<p>mission, the sections of the law just cited declaring lawful all acts done in pursuance
</p>
<p>of such order, including, of course, the trial and punishment by military commission
</p>
<p>of all such offenders, as directly legalized this order of the President as it is possible
</p>
<p>for Congress to legalize or authorize any executive act whatever. 12 Statutes at
</p>
<p>Large, 755, 756.
</p>
<p>But after assuming and declaring with great earnestness in his argument that no
</p>
<p>person could be tried and convicted for such crimes by any military tribunal, whether a
</p>
<p>court-martial or a military commission, save those in the land or naval service in time
</p>
<p>of war, the gentleman makes the extraordinary statement that the creation of a military
</p>
<p>commission must be authorized by the legislative department, and demands, if there be
</p>
<p>any such legislation, " let the statute be produced." The statute has been produced.
</p>
<p>The power so to try, says the gentleman, must be authorized by Congress, when the
</p>
<p>demand is made for such authority. Does not the gentleman thereby give up his argu-
</p>
<p>ment, and admit, that if the Congress has so authorized the trial of all aiders and
</p>
<p>abettors of rebels or insurgents for whatever they do in aid of such rebels and insur-
</p>
<p>gents during the insurrection, the statute and proceedings under it are lawful and valid?
</p>
<p>I have already shown that the Congress have so legislated by expressly legalizing Order
</p>
<p>No. 141, which directed the trial of all rebels, their aiders and abettors, by military
</p>
<p>commission. Did not Congress expressly legalize this order by declaring that the order
</p>
<p>shall be a defense in all courts to any action or prosecution, civil or criminal, for acts
</p>
<p>done in pursuance of it? No amount of argument could make this point clearer than
</p>
<p>the language of the statute itself. But, says the gentleman, if there be a statute author-
</p>
<p>izing trials by military commission, "let it be produced."
</p>
<p>By the act of March 3, 1863, it is provided in section thirty that in time of war,
</p>
<p>insurrection, or rebellion, murder and assault with intent to kill, etc., when committed
</p>
<p>by persons in the military service, shall be punishable by the sentence of a court-martial
</p>
<p>or military commission, and the punishment of such offenses shall never be less th?n
</p>
<p>those inflicted by the laws of the State or district in which they may have been com-
</p>
<p>mitted. By the thirty-eighth section of the same act it is provided that all persons
</p>
<p>who, in time of war or rebellion against the United States, shall be found lurking or

</p>
<p>acting as spies in or about the camps, etc., of the United States, or elsewhere, shall be
</p>
<p>triable by a military commission, and shall, upon conviction, suffer death. Here is a
</p>
<p>statute which expressly declares that all persons, whether citizens or strangers, who in
</p>
<p>time of rebellion shall be found acting as spies, shall suffer death upon conviction by a
</p>
<p>military commission. Why did not the gentleman give "us some argument upon this
</p>
<p>law? We have seen that it was the existing law of the United States under the Con-
</p>
<p>federation. Then, and since, men not in the land or naval forces of the United States
</p>
<p>have suffered death for this offense upon conviction by courts-martial. If it was com-
</p>
<p>petent for Congress to authorize their trial by courts-martial, it was equally competent
</p>
<p>for Congress to authorize their trial by military commission, and accordingly they have
</p>
<p>done so. By the same authority the Congress may extend the jurisdiction of military
</p>
<p>commissions over all military offenses or crimes committed in time of rebellion or war
</p>
<p>in aid of the public enemy; and it certainly stands with right reason, that if it were
</p>
<p>just to subject to death, by the sentence of a military commission, all persons who
</p>
<p>354 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>should be guilty merely of lurking as spies in the interests of the public enemy in time
</p>
<p>of rebellion, though they obtained no information, though they inflicted no personal
</p>
<p>injury, but were simply overtaken and detected in the endeavor to obtain intelligence
</p>
<p>for the enemy, those who enter into conspiracy with the enemy, not only to lurk as
</p>
<p>spies in your camp, but to lurk there as murderers and assassins, and who, in pursuance
</p>
<p>of that conspiracy, commit assassination and murder upon the Commander-in-Chief of
</p>
<p>your army within your camp and in aid of rebellion, should be subject in like manner
</p>
<p>to trial by military commission. Statutes at Large 12, 736, 737, ch. 8.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the President having so declared, the Congress, as we have stated,
</p>
<p>have affirmed that his order was valid, and that all persons acting by authority, and
</p>
<p>consequently as a court pronouncing such sentence upon the offender as the usage of
</p>
<p>war requires, are justified by the law of the land. With all respect, permit me to say
</p>
<p>that the learned gentleman has manifested more acumen and ability in his elaborate
</p>
<p>argument by what he has omitted to say than by anything which he has said. By the
</p>
<p>act of July 2, 1864, cap. 215, it is provided that the commanding general in the field,
</p>
<p>or the commander of the department, as the case may be, shall have power to carry
</p>
<p>into execution all sentences against guerilla marauders for robbery, arson, burglary,
</p>
<p>etc., and for violation of the laws and customs of war, as well as sentences against
</p>
<p>spies, mutineers, deserters, and murderers.
</p>
<p>From the legislation I have cited, it is apparent tha t military commissions are
</p>
<p>expressly recognized by the law-making power; that they are authorized to try capital
</p>
<p>offenses against citizens not in the service of the United States, and to pronounce the
</p>
<p>sentence of death upon them; and that the commander of a department, or the com-
</p>
<p>manding general in the field, may carry such sentence into execution. But, says the
</p>
<p>gentleman, grant all this to be so; Congress has not declared in what manner the court
</p>
<p>shall be constituted. The answer to that objection has already been anticipated in the
</p>
<p>citation from Benet, wherein it appeared to be the rule of the law martial that in the
</p>
<p>punishment of all military offenses not provided for by the written law of the land,
</p>
<p>military commissions are constituted for that purpose by the authority of the command-
</p>
<p>ing officer or the Commander-in-Chief, as the case may be, who selects the officers of a
</p>
<p>court-martial; that they are similarly constituted, and their proceedings conducted
</p>
<p>according to the same general rules. That is a part of the very law martial which the
</p>
<p>President proclaimed, and which the Congress has legalized. The Proclamation has
</p>
<p>declared that all such offenders shall be tried by military commissions. The Congress

</p>
<p>has legalized the same by the act which I have cited; and by every intendment it must
</p>
<p>be taken that, as martial law is by the Proclamation declared to be the rule by which
</p>
<p>they shall be tried, the Congress, in affirming the act of the President, simply declared
</p>
<p>that they should be tried according to the customs of martial law; that the commission
</p>
<p>should be constituted by the Commander-in-Chief according to the rule of procedure
</p>
<p>known as martial law; and that the penalties inflicted should be in accordance with the
</p>
<p>laws of war and the usages of nations. Legislation no more definite than this has been
</p>
<p>upon your statute-book since the beginning of the century, and has been held by the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States valid for the punishment of offenders.
</p>
<p>By the thirty-second article of the act of 23d April, 1800, it is provided that " all
</p>
<p>crimes committed by persons belonging to the navy which are not specified in the fore-
</p>
<p>going articles shall be punished according to the laws and customs in such cases at sea."
</p>
<p>Of this article the Supreme Court of the United States say, that when offences and crimes
</p>
<p>are not given in terms or by definition, the want of it may be supplied by a compre-
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 355
</p>
<p>hensive enactment such as the thirty-second article of the rules for the government of the
</p>
<p>navy; which means that courts-martial have jurisdiction of such crimes as are not
</p>
<p>specified, but which have been recognized to be crimes and offenses by the usages in
</p>
<p>the navies of all nations, and that they shall be punished according to the laws and
</p>
<p>customs of the sea. Dynes vs. Hoover, 20 Howard, 82.
</p>
<p>But it is a fact that must not be omitted in the reply which I make to the gentle-
</p>
<p>man's argument, that an effort was made by himself and others in the Senate of the
</p>
<p>United States, on the 3d of March last, to condemn the arrests, imprisonments, etc.,
</p>
<p>made by order of the President of the United States in pursuance of his Proclamation,
</p>
<p>and to reverse, by the judgment of that body, the law which had been before passed
</p>
<p>affirming his action, which effort most signally failed.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that the body which by the Constitution, if the President had been
</p>
<p>guilty of the misdemeanors alleged against him in this argument of the gentleman,
</p>
<p>would, upon presentation of such charge in legal form against the President, constitute
</p>
<p>the high court of impeachment for his trial and condemnation, has decided the question
</p>
<p>in advance, and declared upon the occasion referred to, as they had before declared by
</p>
<p>solemn enactment, that this order of the President declaring martial law and the pun-
</p>
<p>ishment of all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors, by military commission,
</p>
<p>should be enforced during the insurrection, as the law of the land, and that the
</p>
<p>offenders should be tried, as directed, by military commission. It may be said that this
</p>
<p>subsequent legislation of Congress, ratifying and affirming what had been done by the
</p>
<p>President, can have no validity. Of course it cannot if neither the Congress nor the
</p>
<p>Executive can authorize the proclamation and enforcement of martial law in the sup-
</p>
<p>pression of rebellion for the punishment of all persons committing military offenses in
</p>
<p>aid of that' rebellion. Assuming, however, as the gentleman seemed to assume, by
</p>
<p>asking for the legislation of Congress, that there is such power in Congress, the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States has solemnly affirmed that such ratification is valid.
</p>
<p>2 Black, 671.
</p>
<p>The gentleman's argument is full of citations of English precedent. There is a late
</p>
<p>English precedent bearing upon this point the power of the legislature, by subse-
</p>
<p>quent enactment, to legalize executive orders, arrests, and imprisonment of citizens
</p>
<p>that I beg leave to commend to his consideration. I refer to the statute of II and 12
</p>
<p>Victoria, ch. 35, entitled " An act to empower the lord lieutenant, or other chief gov-
</p>
<p>ernor or governors of Ireland, to apprehend and detain until the first day of March,

</p>
<p>1849, such persons as he or they shall suspect of conspiring against her Majesty's person
</p>
<p>and government," passed July 25, 1848, which statute in terms declares that all and
</p>
<p>every person and persons who is, are, or shall be, within that period, within that part
</p>
<p>of the United Kingdom of England and Ireland called Ireland at or on the day the act
</p>
<p>shall receive her Majesty's royal assent, or after, by warrant for high treason or treason-
</p>
<p>able practices, or suspicion of high treason or treasonable practices, signed by the lord
</p>
<p>lieutenant, or other chief governor or governors of Ireland for the time being, or his or
</p>
<p>their chief secretary, for such causes as aforesaid, may be detained in safe custody
</p>
<p>without bail or main prize, until the first day of March, 1849; and that no judge or
</p>
<p>justice shall bail or try any such person or persons so committed, without order from
</p>
<p>her Majesty's privy council, until the said first day of March, 1849, any law or statute
</p>
<p>to the contrary notwithstanding. The second section of this act provides that, in cases
</p>
<p>where any persons have been, before the passing of the act, arrested, committed, or
</p>
<p>detained for such cause by warrant or warrants signed by the officers aforesaid, or
</p>
<p>356 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>either of them, it may be lawful for the person or persons to whom such warrants have
</p>
<p>been or shall be directed, to detain such person or persons in his or their custody in any
</p>
<p>place whatever in Ireland; and that such person or persons to whom such warrants
</p>
<p>have been or shall be directed shall be deemed and taken, to all intents and purposes,
</p>
<p>lawfully authorized to take into safe custody and be the lawful jailers and keepers of
</p>
<p>such persons so arrested, committed, or detained.
</p>
<p>Here the power of arrest is given by the act of Parliament to the governor or his
</p>
<p>secretary; the process of the civil courts was wholly suspended; bail was denied and
</p>
<p>the parties imprisoned, and this not by process of the courts, but by warrant of a
</p>
<p>chief governor or his secretary; not for crimes charged to have been committed, but
</p>
<p>for being suspected of treasonable practices. Magna Charta, it seems, opposes no
</p>
<p>restraint, notwithstanding the parade that is made about it in this argument, upon the
</p>
<p>power of the Parliament of England to legalize arrests and imprisonments made before
</p>
<p>the passage of the act upon an executive order, and without colorable authority of
</p>
<p>statute law, and to authorize like arrests and imprisonments of so many of six million of
</p>
<p>people as such executive officers might suspect of treasonable practices.
</p>
<p>But, says the gentleman, whatever may be the precedents, English or American,
</p>
<p>whatever may be the provisions of the Constitution, whatever may be the legislation of
</p>
<p>Congress, whatever may be the proclamations and orders of the President as Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief, it is a usurpation and a tyranny in time of rebellion and civil war to
</p>
<p>subject any citizen to trial for any crime before military tribunals, save such citizens as
</p>
<p>are in the land or naval forces, and against this usurpation, which he asks this court to
</p>
<p>rebuke by solemn decision, he appeals to public opinion. I trust that I set as high
</p>
<p>value upon enlightened public opinion as any man. I recognize it as the reserved power
</p>
<p>of the people which creates and dissolves armies, which creates and dissolves legislative
</p>
<p>assemblies, which enacts and repeals fundamental laws, the better to provide for per-
</p>
<p>sonal security by the due administration of justice. To that public opinion upon this
</p>
<p>very question of the usurpation of authority, of unlawful arrests, and unlawful imprison-
</p>
<p>ments, and unlawful trials, condemnations, and executions by the late President of the
</p>
<p>United States, an appeal has already been taken. On this very issue the President was
</p>
<p>tried before the tribunal of the people, that great nation of freemen who cover this con-
</p>
<p>tinent, looking out upon Europe from their eastern and upon Asia from their western
</p>
<p>homes. That people came to the consideration of this issue not unmindful of the fact
</p>
<p>that the first struggle for the establishment of our nationality could not have been, and

</p>
<p>was not, successfully prosecuted without the proclamation and enforcement of martial
</p>
<p>law, declaring, as we have seen, that any inhabitant who, during that war, should
</p>
<p>kill any loyal citizen, or enter into any combination for that purpose, should, upon trial
</p>
<p>and conviction before a military tribunal, be sentenced as an assassin, traitor, or spy,
</p>
<p>and should suffer death, and that in this last struggle for the maintenance of American
</p>
<p>nationality the President but followed the example of the illustrious Father of his
</p>
<p>Country. Upon that issue the people passed judgment on the 8th day of last Nov-
</p>
<p>ember, and declared that the charge of usurpation was false.
</p>
<p>From this decision of the people there lies no appeal on this earth. Who can right-
</p>
<p>fully challenge the authority of the American people to decide such questions for them-
</p>
<p>selves? The voice of the people, thus solemnly proclaimed, by the omnipotence of the
</p>
<p>ballot in favor of the righteous order of their murdered President, issued by him for
</p>
<p>the common defense, for the preservation of the Constitution, and for the enforcement
</p>
<p>of the laws of the Union, ought to be accepted, and will be accepted, I trust, by all
</p>
<p>just men, as the voice of God.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 357
</p>
<p>MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT: I have said thus much touching the right of the people,
</p>
<p>under their Constitution, in time of civil war and rebellion, to proclaim through their
</p>
<p>Executive, with the sanction and approval of their Congress, martial law, and enforce
</p>
<p>the same according to the usage of nations.
</p>
<p>I submit that it has been shown that, by the letter and spirit of the Constitution, as
</p>
<p>well as by its contemporaneous construction, followed and approved by every depart-
</p>
<p>ment of the government, this. right is in the people; that it is inseparable from the con-
</p>
<p>dition of war, whether civil or foreign, and absolutely essential to its vigorous and
</p>
<p>successful prosecution; that according to the highest authority upon constitutional law,
</p>
<p>the proclamation and enforcement of martial law are " usual under all governments in
</p>
<p>time of rebellion " ; that our own highest judicial tribunal has declared this, and solemnly
</p>
<p>ruled that the question of the necessity for its exercise rests exclusively with Congress and
</p>
<p>the President; and that the decision of the political departments of the government,
</p>
<p>that there is an armed rebellion and a necessity for the employment of military force
</p>
<p>and martial law in its suppression concludes the judiciary.
</p>
<p>In submitting what I have said in support of the jurisdiction of this honorable court,
</p>
<p>and of its constitutional power to hear and determine this issue, I have uttered my own
</p>
<p>convictions; and for their utterance in defense of my country, and its right to employ
</p>
<p>all the means necessary for the common defense against armed rebellion and secret
</p>
<p>treasonable conspiracy in aid of such rebellion, I shall neither ask pardon nor offer
</p>
<p>apology. I find no words with which more fitly to conclude all I have to say upon the
</p>
<p>question of the jurisdiction and constitutional authority of this court than those employed
</p>
<p>by the illustrious Lord Brougham to the House of Peers in the support of the bill before
</p>
<p>referred to, which empowered the lord lieutenant of Ireland, and his deputies, to
</p>
<p>apprehend and detain, for the period of seven months or more, all such persons within
</p>
<p>that island as they should suspect of conspiracy against her Majesty's person and govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Said that illustrious man: "A friend of liberty I have lived, and such will I
</p>
<p>die; nor care I how soon the latter event may happen, if I cannot be a friend of liberty
</p>
<p>without being a friend of traitors at the same time a protector of criminals of the
</p>
<p>deepest dye an accomplice of foul rebellion and of its concomitant, civil war, with
</p>
<p>all its atrocities and all its fearful consequences." Hansard's Debates, 3d series, vol.

<p>of fact involved in the issue are :
</p>
<p>First, did the accused, or any two of them, confederate and conspire together as
</p>
<p>charged ? and
</p>
<p>Second, did the accused, or any of them, in pursuance of such conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>with the intent alleged, commit either or all of the several acts specified?
</p>
<p>If the conspiracy be established, as laid, it results that whatever was said or done
</p>
<p>by either of the parties thereto, in the furtherance or execution of the common design,
</p>
<p>is the declaration or act of all the other parties to the conspiracy; and this, whether the
</p>
<p>other parties, at the time such words were uttered or such acts done by their confederates,
</p>
<p>were present or absent here, within the intrenched lines of your capital, or crouching
</p>
<p>behind the intrenched lines of Richmond, or awaiting the results of their murderous
</p>
<p>plot against their country, its Constitution and laws, across the border, under the shelter
</p>
<p>of the British flag.
</p>
<p>The declared and accepted rule of law in cases of conspiracy is that
</p>
<p>358 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>" In prosecutions for conspiracy it is an established rule that where several persons
</p>
<p>are proved to have combined together for the same illegal purpose, any act done by
</p>
<p>one of the party, in pursuance of the original concerted plan, and in reference to the
</p>
<p>common object, is, in the contemplation of law as well as in sound reason, the act of
</p>
<p>the whole party; and, therefore, the proof of the act will be evidence against any of
</p>
<p>the others who were engaged in the same general conspiracy, without regard to the
</p>
<p>question whether the prisoner is proved to have been concerned in the particular trans-
</p>
<p>action." Phillips on Evidence, p. 210.
</p>
<p>The same rule obtains in cases of treason: " If several persons agree to levy war,
</p>
<p>some in one place and some in another, and one party do actually appear in arms, this
</p>
<p>is a levying of war by all, as well those who were not in arms as those who were, if it
</p>
<p>were done in pursuance of the original concert, for those who made the attempt were
</p>
<p>emboldened by the confidence inspired by the general concert, and therefore these par-
</p>
<p>ticular acts are in justice imputable to all the rest." I East., Pleas of the Crown,
</p>
<p>p. 97; Roscoe, 84.
</p>
<p>In Ex parte Bollman and Swartwout, 4 Cranch, 126, Marshall, Chief Justice,
</p>
<p>rules: "If war be actually levied, that is, if a body of men be actually assembled,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of effecting, by force, a treasonable purpose, all those who perform
</p>
<p>any part, however minute, or however remote from the scene of action, and who are
</p>
<p>actually leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors."
</p>
<p>In United States vs. Cole et al, 5 McLean, 601, Mr. Justice McLean says: "A
</p>
<p>conspiracy is rarely, if ever, proved by positive testimony. When a crime of high
</p>
<p>magnitude is about to be perpetrated by a combination of individuals, they do not act
</p>
<p>openly but covertly and secretly. The purpose formed is known only to those who
</p>
<p>enter into it. Unless one of the original conspirators betray his companions and give
</p>
<p>evidence against them, their guilt can be proved only by circumstantial evidence. . . .
</p>
<p>It is said by some writers on evidence that such circumstances are stronger than positive
</p>
<p>proof. A witness swearing positively, it is said, may misapprehend the facts or swear
</p>
<p>falsely, but that circumstances cannot lie.
</p>
<p>" The common design is the essence of the charge; and this may be made to appear
</p>
<p>when the defendants steadily pursue the same object, whether acting separately or
</p>
<p>together, by common or different means, all leading to the same unlawful result. And
</p>
<p>where prima facie evidence has been given of a combination, the acts or confessions
</p>
<p>of one are evidence against all. . . . It is reasonable that where a body of men

<p>assume the attribute of individuality, whether for commercial business or for the com-
</p>
<p>mission of a crime, that the association should be bound by the acts of one of its
</p>
<p>members in carrying out the design."
</p>
<p>It is a rule of the law, not to be overlooked in this connection, that the conspiracy
</p>
<p>or agreement of the parties, or some of them, to act in concert to accomplish the
</p>
<p>unlawful act charged, may be established either by direct evidence of a meeting or
</p>
<p>consultation for the illegal purpose charged, or more usually, from the very nature of
</p>
<p>the case, by circumstantial evidence. 2 Starkie, 232.

<p>Lord Mansfield ruled that it was not necessary to prove the actual fact of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, but that it might be collected from collateral circumstances. Parson's Case,

<p>" If," says a great authority on the law of evidence, "on a charge of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>it appear that two persons by their acts are pursuing the same object, and often by the
</p>
<p>same means, or one performing part of the act and the other completing it, for the

</p>
<p>attainment of the same object, the jury may draw the conclusion there is a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>If a conspiracy be formed, and a person join in it afterwards, he is equally guilty with
</p>
<p>the original conspirators." Roscoe, 415.
</p>
<p>"The rule of the admissibility of the acts and declarations of any one of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators, said or done in furtherance of the common design, applies in cases as well
</p>
<p>where only part of the conspirators are indicted or upon trial as where all are indicted
</p>
<p>and upon trial. Thus, upon an indictment for murder, if it appear that others, together
</p>
<p>with the prisoner, conspired to commit the crime, the act of one, done in pursuance of
</p>
<p>that intention, will be evidence against the rest." ad Starkie, 237.
</p>
<p>They are all alike guilty as principals. Commonwealth vs. Knapp, 9 Pickering,

<p>496; 10 Pickering, 477; 6 Term Reports, 528; n East., 584.
</p>
<p>What is the evidence, direct and circumstantial, that the accused, or either of them,
</p>
<p>together with John H. Surratt, John Wilkes Booth, Jefferson Davis, George N. Sanders,
</p>
<p>Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thompson, William C. Cleary, Clement C. Clay, George Harper,
</p>
<p>and George Young, did combine, confederate, and conspire, in aid of the existing rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, as charged, to kill and murder, within the military department of Washington, and
</p>
<p>within the fortified and intrenched lines thereof, Abraham Lincoln, late, and at the
</p>
<p>time of the said combining, confederating, and conspiring, President of the United
</p>
<p>States of America and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy thereof; Andrew
</p>
<p>Johnson, Vice-President of the United States; William H. Seward, Secretary of State
</p>
<p>of the United States; and Ulysses S. Grant, Lieutenant General of the armies thereof,
</p>
<p>and then in command, under the direction of the President?
</p>
<p>The time, as laid in the charge and specification, when this conspiracy was entered
</p>
<p>into, is immaterial, so that it appear by the evidence that the criminal combination and
</p>
<p>agreement were formed before the commission of the acts alleged. That Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, one of the conspirators named, was the acknowledged chief and leader of the
</p>
<p>existing rebellion against the government of the United States, and that Jacob Thomp-
</p>
<p>son, George N. Sanders, Clement C. Clay, Beverly Tucker, and others named in the
</p>
<p>specification, were his duly accredited and authorized agents to act in the interests of
</p>
<p>said rebellion, are facts established by the testimony in this case beyond all question.
</p>
<p>That Davis, as the leader of said rebellion, gave to those agents, then in Canada, com-
</p>
<p>missions in blank, bearing the official signature of his war minister, James A. Seddon,
</p>
<p>to be by them filled up and delivered to such agents as they might employ to act in the
</p>
<p>interests of the rebellion within the United States, and intended to be a cover and pro-

<p>tection for any crimes they might therein commit in the service of the rebellion, is also
</p>
<p>a fact established here, and which no man can gainsay. Who doubts that Kennedy,
</p>
<p>whose confession made in view of immediate death, as proved here, was commissioned
</p>
<p>by those accredited agents of Davis to burn the city of New York ? that he was to
</p>
<p>have attempted it on the night of the presidental election, and that he did, in combina-
</p>
<p>tion with his confederates, set fire to four hotels in the city of New York on the night
</p>
<p>of the 25th of November last? Who doubts that, in like manner, in the interests of the
</p>
<p>rebellion and by the authority of Davis, these his agents also commissioned Bennett H.
</p>
<p>Young to commit arson, robbery, and the murder of unarmed citizens, in St. Albans,
</p>
<p>Vt. ? Who doubts, upon the testimony shown, that Davis, by his agents, deliber-
</p>
<p>ately adopted the system of starvation for the murder of our captive soldiers in his
</p>
<p>hands ; or that, as shown by the testimony, he sanctioned the burning of hospitals and
</p>
<p>steamboats, the property of private persons, and paid therefor from his stolen treasure
</p>
<p>the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars in gold ? By the evidence of Joseph Godfrey

<p>360 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>Hyams it is proved that Thompson, the agent of Jefferson Davis, paid him money
</p>
<p>for the service he rendered in the infamous and fiendish project of importing pestilence
</p>
<p>into our camps and cities to destroy the lives of citizens and soldiers alike, and into the
</p>
<p>house of the President for the purpose of destroying his life. It may be said, and
</p>
<p>doubtless will be said, by the pensioned advocates of this rebellion, that Hyams, being
</p>
<p>infamous, is not to be believed. It is admitted that he is infamous, as it must be conceded
</p>
<p>that any man is infamous who either participates in such a crime or attempts in anywise
</p>
<p>to extenuate it. But it will be observed that Hyams is supported by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Mr. Sanford Conover, who heard Blackburn and the other rebel agents in Canada speak
</p>
<p>of this infernal project, and by the testimony of Mr. Wall, the well-known auctioneer
</p>
<p>of this city, whose character in unquestioned, that he received this importation of pesti-
</p>
<p>lence (of course without any knowledge of the purpose), and that Hyams consigned
</p>
<p>the goods to him in the name of J. W. Harris, a fact in itself an acknowledgment of
</p>
<p>guilt; and that he received afterwards a letter from Harris, dated Toronto, Canada
</p>
<p>West, December I, 1864, wherein Harris stated that he had not been able to come to
</p>
<p>the States since his return to Canada, and asked for an account of the sale. He identi-
</p>
<p>fies the Godfrey Joseph Hyams who testified in court as the J. W. Harris who imported
</p>
<p>the pestilence. The very transaction shows that Hyams's statement is truthful. He
</p>
<p>gives the names of the parties connected with this infamy (Clement C. Clay, Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn, Rev. Dr. Stuart Robinson, J. C. Holcombe all refugees from the Con-
</p>
<p>federacy in Canada), and states that he gave Thompson a receipt for the fifty dollars
</p>
<p>paid to him, and that he was by occupation a shoemaker; in none of which facts is
</p>
<p>there an attempt to discredit him. It is not probable that a man in his position in life
</p>
<p>would be able to buy five trunks of clothing, ship them all the way from Halifax to
</p>
<p>Washington, and then order them to be sold at auction, without regard to price, solely
</p>
<p>upon his own account. It is a matter of notoriety that a part of his statement is verified
</p>
<p>by the results at New Berne, N.C., to which point he says a portion of the infected
</p>
<p>goods were shipped, through a sutler; the result of which was, that nearly two thou-
</p>
<p>sand citizens and soldiers died there about that time with yellow fever.
</p>
<p>That the rebel chief, Jefferson Davis, sanctioned these crimes, committed and
</p>
<p>attempted through the instrumentality of his accredited agents in Canada Thompson,
</p>
<p>Clay, Tucker, Sanders, Cleary, etc., upon the persons and property of the people of
</p>
<p>the North, their is positive proof on your record. The letter brought from Richmond,

<p>II, 1865, and addressed to him by the late rebel senator from Texas, W. S. Oldham,
</p>
<p>contains the following significant words: "When Senator Johnson, of Missouri, and
</p>
<p>myself waited on you a few days since, in relation to the project of annoying and har-
</p>
<p>assing the enemy by means of burning their shipping, towns, etc., etc., there were
</p>
<p>several remarks made by you upon the subject which I was not fully prepared to
</p>
<p>answer, but which, upon subsequent conference with parties proposing the enterprise,
</p>
<p>I find cannot apply as objections to the scheme. First, the ' combustible materials '
</p>
<p>consist of several preparations, and not one alone, and can be used without exposing
</p>
<p>the party using them to the least danger of detection whatever. . . . Second,
</p>
<p>there is no necessity for sending persons in the military service into the enemy's coun-
</p>
<p>try, but the work may be done by agents. ... I have seen enough of the effects
</p>
<p>that can be produced to satisfy me that in most cases, without any danger to the parties
</p>
<p>engaged, and in others but very slight, we can, first, burn every vessel that leaves a
</p>
<p>foreign port for the United States; second, we can burn every transport that leaves the
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 361
</p>
<p>harbor of New York, or other Northern port, with supplies for the armies of the enemy
</p>
<p>in the South; third, burn every transport and gunboat on the Mississippi River, as well
</p>
<p>as devastate the country of the enemy and fill his people with terror and consternation.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of satisfying your mind upon the subject, I respectfully, but
</p>
<p>earnestly, request that you will give an interview with General Harris, formerly a
</p>
<p>member of Congress from Missouri, who, I think, is able, from conclusive proofs, to
</p>
<p>convince you that what I have suggested is perfectly feasible and practicable."
</p>
<p>No one can doubt, from the tenure of this letter, that the rebel Davis only wanted
</p>
<p>to be satisfied that this system of arson and murder could be carried on by his agents
</p>
<p>in the North successfully and without detection. With him it was not a crime to do
</p>
<p>these acts, but only a crime to be detected in them. But Davis, by his indorsement on
</p>
<p>this letter, dated the 2Oth of February, 1865, bears witness to his own complicity and
</p>
<p>his own infamy in this proposed work of destruction and crime for the future, as well
</p>
<p>as to his complicity in what had before been attempted without complete success. Ken-
</p>
<p>nedy, with his confederates, had failed to burn the city of New York. "The combus-
</p>
<p>tibles " which Kennedy had employed were, it seems, defective. This was " a difficulty
</p>
<p>to be overcome." Neither had he been able to consummate the dreadful work without
</p>
<p>subjecting himself to detection. This was another " difficulty to be overcome." Davis,
</p>
<p>on the 2Oth of February, 1865, indorsed upon this letter these words: "Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, at his convenience, see General Harris and learn what plan he has for overcoming
</p>
<p>the difficulties heretofore experienced. J. Z)."
</p>
<p>This indorsement is unquestionably proved to be the handwriting of Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, and it bears witness on its face that the monstrous proposition met his approval,
</p>
<p>and that he desired his rebel Secretary of State, Benjamin, to see General Harris and
</p>
<p>learn how to overcome the difficulty heretofore experienced, to wit : the inefficiency of
</p>
<p>" the combustible materials " that had been employed, and the liability of his agents to
</p>
<p>detection. After this, who will doubt that he had endeavored, by the hand of incen-
</p>
<p>diaries, to destroy by fire the property and lives of the people of the North, and thereby
</p>
<p>"fill them with terror and consternation" ; that he knew his agents had been unsuc-
</p>
<p>cessful; that he knew his agents had been detected in their villainy and punished for
</p>
<p>their crime; that he desired through a more perfect " chemical preparation," by the
</p>
<p>science and skill of Professor McCulloch, to accomplish successfully what had before
</p>
<p>been unsuccessfully attempted?

<p>West, November I, 1864, is an acknowledgment and confession of what they had
</p>
<p>attempted, and a suggestion made through J. P. Benjamin, rebel Secretary of State,
</p>
<p>of what remained to be done in order to make the " chemical preparations " efficient.
</p>
<p>Speaking of this Bennett II. Young, he says: " You have doubtless learned through the
</p>
<p>press of the United States of the raid on St. Albans by about twenty-five Confederate
</p>
<p>soldiers, led by Lieut. Bennett H. Young; of their attempt and failure to burn the town;
</p>
<p>of their robbery of three banks there of the aggregate amount of about two hundred
</p>
<p>thousand dollars; of their arrest in Canada by United -States forces; of their commit-
</p>
<p>ment and the pending preliminary trial." He makes application, in aid of Young and his
</p>
<p>associates, for additional documents, showing that they acted upon the authority of the
</p>
<p>Confederate States government, taking care to say, however, that he held such author-
</p>
<p>ity at the time, but that it ought to be more explicit so far as regards the particular acts
</p>
<p>complained of. He states that he met Young at Halifax in May, 1864, who developed
</p>
<p>his plans for retaliation on the enemy; that he, Clay, recommended him to the rebel
</p>
<p>362 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>Secretary of War; that after this "Young was sent back by the Secretary of War with
</p>
<p>a commission as second lieutenant to execute his plans and purposes, but to report to
</p>
<p>Hon. and myself." Young afterwards " proposed passing through New England,
</p>
<p>burning some towns and robbing them of whatever he could convert to the use of the
</p>
<p>Confederate government. This I approved as justifiable retaliation. He attempted to
</p>
<p>burn the town of St. Albans, Vt., and would have succeeded but for the failure of the
</p>
<p>chemical preparation with which he was armed. He then robbed the banks of funds
</p>
<p>amounting to over two hundred thousand dollars. That he was not prompted by selfish
</p>
<p>or mercenary motives I am as well satisfied as I am that he is an honest man. He
</p>
<p>assured me before going that his effort would be to destroy towns and farm-houses, but
</p>
<p>not to plunder or rob; but he said if, after firing a town, he saw he could take funds
</p>
<p>from a bank or any house, and thereby might inflict injury upon the enemy and benefit
</p>
<p>liis own government, he would do so. He added most emphatically, that whatever he
</p>
<p>took should be turned over to the government or its representatives in foreign lands.
</p>
<p>My instructions to him were to destroy whatever was valuable; not to stop to rob, but
</p>
<p>If, after firing a town, he could seize and carry off money or treasury or bank notes, he
</p>
<p>might do so upon condition that they were delivered to the proper authorities of the
</p>
<p>Confederate States " that is, to Clay himself.
</p>
<p>When he wrote this letter it seems that this accredited agent of Jefferson Davis was
</p>
<p>as strongly impressed with the usurpation and despotism of Mr. Lincoln's administra-
</p>
<p>tion as some of the advocates of his aiders and abettors seem to be at this day; and he
</p>
<p>indulges in the following statement: "All that a large portion of the Northern people,
</p>
<p>especially in the northwest, want to resist the oppressions of the despotism at Washing-
</p>
<p>ton is a leader. They are ripe for resistance, and it may come soon after the presidential
</p>
<p>election. At all events, it must come if our armies are not overcome, or destroyed, or
</p>
<p>dispersed. No people of the Anglo-Saxon blood can long endure the usurpations and
</p>
<p>tyrannies of Lincoln.' 1 '' Clay does not sign the despatch, but indorses the bearer of it
</p>
<p>.as a person who can identify him and give his name. The bearer of that letter was the
</p>
<p>witness Richard Montgomery, who saw Clay write a portion of the letter, and received
</p>
<p>it from his hands, and subsequently delivered it to the Assistant Secretary of War of
</p>
<p>the United States, Mr. Dana. That the letter is in Clay's handwriting is clearly proved
</p>
<p>by those familiar with it. Mr. Montgomery testifies that he was instructed by Clay to
</p>
<p>deliver this letter to Benjamin, the rebel Secretary of State, if he could get through to
</p>
<p>Richmond, and to tell him what names to put in the blanks.

<p>This letter leaves no doubt, if any before existed in the mind of any one who had
</p>
<p>read the letter of Oldham and Davis's indorsement thereon, that "the chemical prepa-
</p>
<p>rations" and " combustible materials " had been tried and had failed, and it had
</p>
<p>become a matter of great moment and concern that they should be so prepared as, in
</p>
<p>the words of Davis, "to overcome the difficulties heretofore experienced " ; that is to
</p>
<p>say, complete the work of destruction, and secure the perpetrators against personal
</p>
<p>injury or detection in the performance of it.
</p>
<p>It only remains to be seen whether Davis, the procurer of arson and of the indis-
</p>
<p>criminate murder of the innocent and unoffending necessarily resultant therefrom, was
</p>
<p>capable also of endeavoring to procure, and in fact did procure, the murder, by direct
</p>
<p>assassination, of the President of the United States and others charged with the duty
</p>
<p>of maintaining the government of the United States, and of suppressing the rebellion
</p>
<p>in which this arch-traitor and conspirator was engaged.
</p>
<p>The official papers of Davis, captured under the guns of our victorious army in his
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 363
</p>
<p>Tebel capital, identified beyond question or shadow of doubt, and placed upon your
</p>
<p>record, together with the declaration and acts of his co-conspirators and agents, proclaim
</p>
<p>to all the world that he was capable of attempting to accomplish his treasonable proc-
</p>
<p>uration of the murder of the late President, and other chief officers of the United
</p>
<p>States, by the hands of hired assassins.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1864 Lieutenant W. Alston addresses to " his excellency " a letter
</p>
<p>now before the court, which contains the following words:
</p>
<p>" I now offer you my services, and if you will favor me in my designs I will proceed,
</p>
<p>as soon as my health will permit, to rid my country of some of her deadliest enemies,
</p>
<p>by striking at the very hearts' blood of those who seek to enchain her in slavery. I con-
</p>
<p>sider nothing dishonorable having such a tendency. All I ask of you is, to favor me by
</p>
<p>granting me the necessary papers, etc., to travel on. . . . / am perfectly familiar
</p>
<p>with the North, and feel confident that I can execute anything I undertake. I was in the
</p>
<p>raid last June in Kentucky, under General John H. Morgan; . . . was taken pris-
</p>
<p>oner; . . . escaped from them by dressing myself in the garb of a citizen.
</p>
<p>I went through to the Canadas, from whence, by the assistance of Colonel J. P. Ilolcomb,
</p>
<p>I succeeded in working my way around and through the blockade. ... I should
</p>
<p>like to have a personal interview with you in order to perfect the arrangements before
</p>
<p>starting."
</p>
<p>Is there any room to doubt that this was a proposition to assassinate, by the hand
</p>
<p>of this man and 'his associates, such persons in the North as he deemed the " deadliest
</p>
<p>enemies" of the rebellion? The weakness of the man who for a moment can doubt
</p>
<p>that such was the proposition of the writer of this letter is certainly an object of com-
</p>
<p>miseration. What had Jefferson Davis to say to this proposed assassination of the
</p>
<p>" deadliest enemies " in the North of his great treason? Did the atrocious suggestion
</p>
<p>kindle in him indignation against the villain who offered, with hie own hand, to strike
</p>
<p>the blow? Not at all. On the contrary, he ordered his private secretary, on the 2gth
</p>
<p>of November, 1864, to endorse upon the letter these words: " Lieutenant W. Alston;
</p>
<p>accompanied raid into Kentucky, and was captured, but escaped into Canada, from
</p>
<p>whence he found his way back. Now offers his services to rid the country of some of
</p>
<p>its deadliest enemies; asks for papers, etc. Respectfully referred, by direction of the
</p>
<p>President, to the honorable Secretary of War." It is also indorsed, for attention, " by
</p>
<p>order. (Signed) J. A. Campbell, Assistant Secretary of War."
</p>
<p>Note the fact in this connection, that Jefferson Davis himself, as well as his

<p>subordinates, had, before the date of this indorsement, concluded that Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln was "the deadliest enemy " of the rebellion. You hear it in the rebel camp
</p>
<p>in Virginia, in 1863, declared by Booth, then and there present, and assented to by
</p>
<p>rebel officers, that " Abraham Lincoln must be killed." You hear it in that slaughter-pen
</p>
<p>in Georgia Andersonville proclaimed among rebel officers, who, by the slow torture
</p>
<p>of starvation, inflicted cruel and untimely death on ten thousand of your defenders, cap-
</p>
<p>tives in their hands whispering, like demons, their horrid purpose, " Abraham Lincoln
</p>
<p>must be killed." And in Canada, the accredited agents of Jefferson Davis, as early as
</p>
<p>October, 1864, and afterwards, declared that " Abraham Lincoln must be killed " if
</p>
<p>his re-election could not be prevented. These agents in Canada, on t" e I3th of
</p>
<p>October, 1864, delivered, in cipher, to be transmitted to Richmond by Richard Mont-
</p>
<p>gomery, the witness, whose reputation is unchallenged, the following communication :
</p>
<p>"OCTOBER 13, 1864.
</p>
<p>" We again urge the immense necessity of our gaining immediate advantages.
</p>
<p>Strain every nerve for victory. We now look upon the re-election of Lincoln in
</p>
<p>364 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>November as almost certain, and we need to whip his hirelings to prevent it. Besides,,
</p>
<p>with Lincoln re-elected, and his armies victorious, we need not hope even for recogni-
</p>
<p>tion, much less the help mentioned in our last. Holcomh will explain this. Those
</p>
<p>figures of the Yankee armies are correct to a unit. Our friends shall be immediately set'
</p>
<p>to work as you direct. ' '
</p>
<p>To which an official reply, in cipher, was delivered to Montgomery by an agent of
</p>
<p>the state department in Richmond, dated October 19, 1864, as follows:
</p>
<p>" Your letter of the I3th instant is at hand. There is yet time enough to colonize
</p>
<p>many voters before November. A blow will shortly be stricken here. It is not quite
</p>
<p>time. General Longstreet is to attack Sheridan without delay, and then move north as
</p>
<p>far as practicable toward unprotected points. This will be made instead of movement
</p>
<p>before mentioned. He will endeavor to assist the republicans in collecting their ballots.
</p>
<p>Be watchful and assist him."
</p>
<p>On the very day of the date of this Richmond despatch, Sheridan was attacked, with
</p>
<p>what success history will declare. The court will not fail to notice that the re-election of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln is to be prevented, if possible, by any and every means. Nor will they fail
</p>
<p>to notice that Holcombe is to " explain this " the same person who, in Canada, was the
</p>
<p>friend and advisor of Alston, who proposed to Davis the assassination of the " deadliest
</p>
<p>enemies " of the rebellion.
</p>
<p>In the despatch of the I3th of October, which was borne by Montgomery, and trans-
</p>
<p>mitted to Richmond in October last, you will find these words: " Our friends shall be
</p>
<p>immediately set to work as you direct." Mr. Lincoln is the subject of that despatch.
</p>
<p>Davis is therein notified that his agents in Canada look upon the re-election of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln in November as almost certain. In this connection he is assured by those agents
</p>
<p>that the friends of their cause are to be set to work as Davis had directed. The con-
</p>
<p>versations, which are proved by witnesses whose character stands unimpeached, disclose
</p>
<p>what " work " the " friends " were to do under the direction of Davis himself. Who
</p>
<p>were these " friends," and what was " the work " which his agents, Thompson, Clay,
</p>
<p>Tucker, and Sanders, had been directed to set them at ? Let Thompson answer for him-
</p>
<p>self. In a conversation with Richard Montgomery in the summer of 1864, Thompson
</p>
<p>said that he " had his friends, confederates, all over the Northern States, who were ready
</p>
<p>and willing to go any lengths for the good of the cause of the South, and he could at anjr
</p>
<p>time have the tyrant Lincoln or any other of his advisers that he chose put out of his -way ;
</p>
<p>that they would not consider it a crime when done for the cause of the Confederacy."

</p>
<p>This conversation was repeated by the witness in the summer of 1864, to Clement C.
</p>
<p>Clay, who immediately stated : " That is so ; we are all devoted to our cause and ready
</p>
<p>to go any length to do anything under the sun."
</p>
<p>At and about the time that these declarations of Clay and Thompson were made, Alston,
</p>
<p>who made the proposition, as we have seen, to Davis to be furnished with papers to go
</p>
<p>north and rid the Confederacy of some of its "deadliest enemies," was in Canada.
</p>
<p>He was doubtless one of the " friends " referred to. As appears by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Montgomery, Payne, the prisoner at your bar, was about that time in Canada, and was
</p>
<p>seen standing by Thompson's door, engaged in a conversation with Clay, between whom
</p>
<p>and the witness some words were interchanged, when Clay stated he (Payne) was one
</p>
<p>of their friends "we trust him." It is proved beyond a shadow of doubt that in
</p>
<p>October last John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of the President, was also in Canada, and
</p>
<p>upon intimate terms with Thompson, Clay, Sanders, and other rebel agents. Who can
</p>
<p>doubt, in the light of the events which have since transpired, that he was one of the
</p>

</p>
<p>" friends " to be " set to work," as Davis had already directed not, perhaps, as yet
</p>
<p>to assassinate the President, hut to do that other work which is suggested in the letter
</p>
<p>of Oldham, indorsed by Davis in his own hand, and spread upon your record the
</p>
<p>work of a secret incendiary, which was to " fill the people of the North with terror and
</p>
<p>consternation." The other "work" spoken of by Thompson putting the tyrant
</p>
<p>Lincoln and any of his advisers out of the ioay was work doubtless to be commenced only
</p>
<p>after the re-election of Mr. Lincoln, which they had already declared in their despatch
</p>
<p>to their employer, Davis, was with them a foregone conclusion. At all events, it was
</p>
<p>not until after the presidental election in November that Alston proposed to Davis to
</p>
<p>go north on the work of assassination ; nor was it until after that election that Booth was
</p>
<p>found in possession of the letter which is in evidence, and which dicloses the purpose to
</p>
<p>assassinate the President. Being assured, however, when Booth was with them in Canada,
</p>
<p>as they had already declared in their despatch, that the re-election of Mr. Lincoln was
</p>
<p>certain, in which event there would be no hope for the Confederacy, they doubtless
</p>
<p>entered into the arrangement with Booth as one of their " friends," that as soon as that
</p>
<p>fact was determined be should go to " work," and as soon as might be " rid the Con-
</p>
<p>federacy of the tyrant Lincoln and of his advisers."
</p>
<p>That these persons named upon your record, Thompson, Sanders, Clay, Cleary, and
</p>
<p>Tucker, were the agents of Jefferson Davis, is another fact established in this case
</p>
<p>beyond a doubt. They made affidavit of it themselves, of record here, upon the exam-
</p>
<p>ination of their " friends " charged with the raid upon St. Albans, before Judge Smith,
</p>
<p>in Canada. It is in evidence also, by the letter of Clay, before referred to.
</p>
<p>The testimony to which I have thus briefly referred shows, by the letter of his.
</p>
<p>agents of the I3th of October, that Davis had before directed those agents to set his
</p>
<p>friends to work. By the letter of Clay it seems that his direction had been obeyed, and
</p>
<p>his friends had been set to work in the burning and robbery and murder at St. Albans,
</p>
<p>in the attempt to burn the city of New York, and in the attempt to introduce pestilence
</p>
<p>into this capital and into the house of the President. It having appeared, by the letter
</p>
<p>of Alston, and the indorsement thereon, that Davis had in November entertained the
</p>
<p>proposition of sending agents, that is to say " friends," to the North to not only "spread
</p>
<p>terror and consternation among the people " by means of his " chemical preparations,"
</p>
<p>but also, in the words of that letter, to " strike," by the hands of assassins, " at the
</p>
<p>heart's blood " of the deadliest enemies in the North to the Confederacy of traitors ;

</p>
<p>it has also appeared by the testimony of many respectable witnesses, among others the
</p>
<p>attorneys who represented the people of the United States and the State of Vermont, in
</p>
<p>the preliminary trial of the raiders in Canada, that Clay, Thompson, Tucker, Sanders,
</p>
<p>and Cleary declared themselves the agents of the Confederacy. It also clearly appears
</p>
<p>by the correspondence referred to, and the letter of Clay, that they were holding, and
</p>
<p>at any time able to command, blank commissions from Jefferson Davis to authorize their
</p>
<p>friends to do whatever work they appointed them to do in the interests of the rebellion,
</p>
<p>by the destruction of life and property in the North.
</p>
<p>If a prinia facie case justifies, as we have seen by the law of evidence it does, the
</p>
<p>introduction of all declarations and acts of any of the parties to a conspiracy, uttered or
</p>
<p>done in the prosecution of the common design, as evidence against all the rest, it results
</p>
<p>that whatever was said or done in furtherance of the common design, after this month
</p>
<p>of October, 1864, by either of these agents in Canada, is evidence not only against
</p>
<p>themselves, but against Davis as well, of his complicity with them in the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery testifies that he met Jacob Thompson in January at Montreal, when
</p>
<p>366 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>he said that "a proposition had been made to him to rid the world of the tyrant Lin-
</p>
<p>coln, Stanton, Grant, and some others; that he knew the men who had made the prop-
</p>
<p>osition were bold, daring men, able to execute what they undertook; that he himself
</p>
<p>was in favor of the proposition, but had determined to defer his answer until he had
</p>
<p>consulted his government at Richmond; that he was then only awaiting their approval."
</p>
<p>This was about the middle of January, and consequently more than a month after Alston
</p>
<p>had made his proposition direct to Davis, in writing, to go north and rid their Confeder-
</p>
<p>acy of some of its "deadliest enemies." It was at the time of this conversation that
</p>
<p>Payne, the prisoner, was seen by the witness standing at Thompson's door in conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with Clay. This witness also shows the intimacy between Thompson, Clay, Cleary,
</p>
<p>Tucker, and Sanders.
</p>
<p>A few days after the assassination of the President, Beverly Tucker said to this witness
</p>
<p>" that President Lincoln deserved his death long ago; that it was a pity he didn't have
</p>
<p>it long ago, and it was too bad that the boys had not been allowed to act when they
</p>
<p>wanted to."
</p>
<p>This remark undoubtedly had reference to the propositions made in the fall to
</p>
<p>Thompson, and also to Davis, to rid the South of its deadliest enemies by their assassi-
</p>
<p>nation. Cleary, who was accredited by Thompson as his confidential agent, also stated
</p>
<p>to this witness that Booth was one of the party to whom Thompson had referred in the
</p>
<p>conversation in January, in which he said he knew the men who were ready to rid the
</p>
<p>world of the tyrant Lincoln, and of Stanton and Grant. Cleary also said, speaking of
</p>
<p>the assassination, "that it was a pity that the whole work had not been done," and
</p>
<p>added, " they had better look out we are not done yet "; manifestly referring to the
</p>
<p>statement made by his employer, Thompson, before in the summer, that not only the
</p>
<p>tyrant Lincoln, but Stanton and Grant, and others of his advisers, should be put out of
</p>
<p>the way. Cleary also stated to this witness that Booth had visited Thompson twice in'
</p>
<p>the winter, the last time in December, and had also been there in the summer.
</p>
<p>Sanford Conover testified that he had been for some time a clerk in the war depart-
</p>
<p>ment at Richmond; that in Canada he knew Thompson, Sanders, Cleary, Tucker, Clay,
</p>
<p>and other rebel agents; that he knew John H. Surratt and John Wilkes Booth; that he
</p>
<p>saw Booth there upon one occasion, and Surratt upon several successive days; that he
</p>
<p>saw Surratt (whom he describes) in April last in Thompson's room, and also in com-
</p>
<p>pany with Sanders; that about the 6th or 7th of April, Surratt delivered to Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson a despatch brought by him from Benjamin at Richmond, enclosing one in
</p>

</p>
<p>cipher from Davis. Thompson had before this proposed to Conover to engage in a plot
</p>
<p>to assassinate President Lincoln and his cabinet, and on this occasion he laid his hand
</p>
<p>upon these despatches and said, "This makes the thing all right," referring to the
</p>
<p>assent of the rebel authorities, and stated that the rebel authorities had consented to the
</p>
<p>plot to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, the Secretary of War, Secretary of State, Judge
</p>
<p>Chase, and General Grant. Thompson remarked further that the assassination of these
</p>
<p>parties would leave the government of the United States entirely without a head; that
</p>
<p>there was no provision in the Constitution of the United States by which they could
</p>
<p>elect another President if these men were put out of the way.
</p>
<p>In speaking of this assassination of the President and others, Thompson said that it
</p>
<p>was only removing them from office, that the killing of a tyrant was no murder. It
</p>
<p>seems that he had learned precisely the same lesson that Alston had learned in Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, when he communicated with Davis, and said, speaking of the President's assassi-
</p>
<p>nation, " he did not think anything dishonorable that would serve their cause."
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 367
</p>
<p>Thompson stated at the same time that he had conferred a commission on Booth, and
</p>
<p>that everybody engaged in the enterprise would be commissioned, and if it succeeded,
</p>
<p>or failed, and they escaped into Canada, they could not be reclaimed under the extra-
</p>
<p>dition treaty. The fact that Thompson and other rebel agents held blank commissions,
</p>
<p>as I have said, has been proved, and a copy of one of them is of record here.
</p>
<p>This witness also testifies to a conversation with William C. Cleary, shortly after the
</p>
<p>surrender of Lee's army, and on the day before the President's assassination, at the St.
</p>
<p>Lawrence Hotel, Montreal, when speaking of the rejoicing in the States over the cap-
</p>
<p>ture of Richmond, Cleary said, " they would put the laugh on the other side of their
</p>
<p>mouth in a day or two ." These parties knew that Conover was in the secret of the
</p>
<p>assassination, and talked with him about it as freely as they would speak of the weather.
</p>
<p>Before the assassination he had a conversation also with Sanders, who asked him if he
</p>
<p>knew Booth well, and expressed some apprehension that Booth would " make a failure
</p>
<p>of it; that he was desperate and reckless, and he was afraid the whole thing would
</p>
<p>prove a failure."
</p>
<p>Dr. James D. Merritt testifies that George Young, one of the parties named in the
</p>
<p>record, declared in his presence, in Canada, last fall, that Lincoln should never be
</p>
<p>inaugurated; that they had friends in Washington who, I suppose, were some of the
</p>
<p>same friends referred to in the despatch of October 13, and which Davis had directed
</p>
<p>them "to set to work." George N. Sanders also said to him "that Lincoln would
</p>
<p>keep himself mighty close if he did serve another term "; while Steele and other Con-
</p>
<p>federates declared that the tyrant never should serve another term. He heard the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation discussed at a meeting of these rebel agents in Montreal in February last. " San-
</p>
<p>ders said they had plenty of money to accomplish the assassination, and named over a
</p>
<p>number of persons who were ready and willing to engage in undertaking to remove the
</p>
<p>President, Vice-President, the cabinet, and some of the leading generals. At this meet-
</p>
<p>ing he read a letter which he had received from Davis, which justified him in making
</p>
<p>any arrangements that he could to accomplish the object." This letter the witness
</p>
<p>heard read, and it, in substance, declared that if the people in Canada and the South-
</p>
<p>erners in the States were willing to submit to be governed by such a tyrant as Lincoln,
</p>
<p>he didn't wish to recognize them as friends. The letter was read openly; it was also
</p>
<p>handed to Colonel Steele, George Young, Hill, and Scott, to be read. This was about
</p>
<p>the middle of February last. At this meeting Sanders named over the persons who
</p>
<p>were willing to accomplish the assassination, and among the persons thus named was

</p>
<p>Booth, whom the witness had seen in Canada in October ; also George Harper, one of
</p>
<p>the conspirators named on the record, Caldwell, Randall, Harrison, and Surratt.
</p>
<p>The witness understood, from the reading of the letter, that if the President, Vice-
</p>
<p>President, and cabinet could be disposed of it would satisfy the people of the North
</p>
<p>that the Southerners had friends in the North; that a peace could be obtained on better
</p>
<p>terms; that the rebels had endeavored to bring about a war between the United States
</p>
<p>and England, and that Mr. Seward, through his energy and sagacity, had thwarted all
</p>
<p>their efforts; that was given as a reason for removing him. On the 5th or 6th of last
</p>
<p>April this witness met George Harper, Caldwell, Randall, and others, who are spoken of
</p>
<p>in this meeting at Montreal as engaged to assassinate the President and cabinet, when
</p>
<p>Harper said they were going to the States to make a row such as had never been heard
</p>
<p>of, and added that " if I (the witness) did not hear of the death of Old Abe, of the
</p>
<p>Vice-President, and of General Dix in less than ten days I might put him down as a
</p>
<p>fool. That was on the 6th of April. He mentioned that Booth was in Washington at
</p>
<p>368 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>that time. He said they had plenty of friends in Washington, and that some fifteen or
</p>
<p>twenty were going."
</p>
<p>This witness ascertained, on the 8th of April, that Harper and others had left for
</p>
<p>the States. The proof is that these parties could come through to Washington from
</p>
<p>Montreal or Toronto in thirty-six hours. They did come, and within the ten days
</p>
<p>named by Harper the President was murdered ! Some attempts have been made to dis-
</p>
<p>credit this witness (Dr. Merritt), not by the examination of witnesses in court, not by
</p>
<p>any apparent want of truth in the testimony, but by the ex parte statements of these
</p>
<p>rebel agents in Canada and their hired advocates in the United States. There is a state-
</p>
<p>ment upon the record verified by an official communication from the War Department,
</p>
<p>which shows the truthfulness of this witness, and that is, that before the assassination,
</p>
<p>learning that Harper and his associates had started for the States, informed as he was
</p>
<p>of their purpose to assassinate the President, cabinet, and leading generals, Merritt
</p>
<p>deemed it his duty to call, and did call, on the loth of April, upon a justice of the
</p>
<p>peace in Canada, named Davidson, and gave him the information that he might take
</p>
<p>steps to stop these proceedings. The correspondence on this subject with Davidson has
</p>
<p>been brought into court. Dr. Merritt testifies further that after this meeting in Mont-
</p>
<p>real he had a conversation with Clement C. Clay, in Toronto, about the letter from
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis which Sanders had exhibited, in which conversation Clay gave the wit-
</p>
<p>ness to understand that he knew the nature of the letter perfectly, and remarked that
</p>
<p>he thought " the end would justify the means." The witness also testifies to the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of Booth with Sanders in Montreal last fall, and of Surratt in Toronto in February
</p>
<p>last.
</p>
<p>The court must be satisfied by the manner of this and other witnesses to the transac-
</p>
<p>tions in Canada, as well as by the fact that they are wholly uncontradicted in any mate-
</p>
<p>rial matter that they state, that they speak the truth, and that the several parties named
</p>
<p>on your record Davis, Thompson, Cleary, Tucker, Clay, Young, Harper, Booth, and
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt did combine and conspire together in Canada to kill and murder
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, William H. Seward, and Ulysses S. Grant. That
</p>
<p>this agreement was substantially entered into by Booth and the agents of Davis in
</p>
<p>Canada as early as October there cannot be any doubt. The language of Thompson at
</p>
<p>that time and before was, that he was in. favor of the assassination. His further lan-
</p>
<p>guage was that he knew the men who were ready to do it ; and Booth it was shown
</p>
<p>was there at that time, and, as Thompson's secretary says, was one of the men referred

</p>
<p>to by Thompson.
</p>
<p>The fact that others, besides the parties named on the record, were, by the terms of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy to be assassinated in no wise affects the case now on trial. If it is true
</p>
<p>that these parties did conspire to murder other parties, as well as those named upon the
</p>
<p>record, the substance of the charge is proved.
</p>
<p>It is also true that if, in pursuance of that conspiracy, Booth, confederated with
</p>
<p>Surratt and the accused, killed and murdered Abraham Lincoln, the charge and specifi-
</p>
<p>cation is proved literally as stated on your record, although their conspiracy embraced
</p>
<p>other persons. In law the case stands, though it may appear that the conspiracy was to
</p>
<p>kill and murder the parties named in the record and others not named in the record. If
</p>
<p>the proof is that the accused, with Booth, Surratt, Davis, etc., conspired to kill and
</p>
<p>murder one or more of the persons named, the charge of the conspiracy is proved.
</p>
<p>The declaration of Sanders, as proved, that there was plenty of money to carry out
</p>
<p>this assassination, is very strongly corroborated by the testimony of Mr. Campbell, cashier
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 369
</p>
<p>of the Ontario Bank, who states that Thompson, during the current year preceding the
</p>
<p>assassination, had upon deposit in the Montreal branch of the Ontario Bank six hundred
</p>
<p>and forty-nine thousand dollars, beside large sums to his credit in other banks in the
</p>
<p>p rovince.
</p>
<p>There is a further corroboration of the testimony of Conover as to the meeting of
</p>
<p>Thompson and Surratt in Montreal, and the delivery of the despatches from Richmond,
</p>
<p>on the 6th or 7th of April, first, in the fact which is shown by the testimony of Chester,
</p>
<p>that in the winter or spring Booth said he himself or some other party must go to Rich-
</p>
<p>mond, and second, by the letter of Arnold, dated 27th of March last, that he preferred
</p>
<p>Booth's first query, that he would first go to Richmond and see how they would take
</p>
<p>it, manifestly alluding to the proposed assassination of the President. It does not follow
</p>
<p>because Davis had written a letter in February which, in substance, approved the gen-
</p>
<p>eral object, that the parties were fully satisfied with it ; because it is clear there was to
</p>
<p>be some arrangement made about the funds ; and it is also clear that Davis had not
</p>
<p>before as distinctly approved and sanctioned this act as his agents either in Canada or
</p>
<p>here desired. Booth said to Chester, "We must have money ; there is money in this
</p>
<p>business, and if you will enter into it I will place three thousand dollars at the disposal
</p>
<p>of your family ; but I have no money myself, and must go to Richmond," or one of
</p>
<p>the parties must go, " to get money to carry out the enterprise." This was one of
</p>
<p>the arrangements that was to be "made right in Canada."- The funds at Thompson's
</p>
<p>disposal, as the banker testifies, were exclusively raised by drafts of the secretary of the
</p>
<p>treasury of the Confederate States -upon London, deposited in their bank to the credit of
</p>
<p>Thompson.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, about the 27th of March, Surratt did go to Richmond. On the 3rd of
</p>
<p>April he returned to Washington, and the same day left for Canada. Before leaving,
</p>
<p>he stated to Wiechmann that when in Richmond he had had a conversation with Davis
</p>
<p>and with Benjamin. The fact in this connection is not to be overlooked, that on or
</p>
<p>about the day Surratt arrived in Montreal, April 6, Jacob Thompson, as the cashier of
</p>
<p>the Ontario bank states, drew of these Confederate funds the sum of one hundred and
</p>
<p>eighty thousand dollars in the form of certificates, which, as the bank officer testifies,
</p>
<p>" might be used anywhere."
</p>
<p>What more is wanting ? Surely no word further need be spoken to show that John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth was in this conspiracy ; that John H. Surratt was in this conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>and that Jefferson Davis and his several agents named, in Canada, were in this con-

</p>
<p>spiracy. If any additional evidence is wanting to show the complicity of Davis in it,
</p>
<p>let the paper found in the possession of his hired assassin, Booth, come to bear witness
</p>
<p>against him. That paper contained the secret cipher which Davis used in his state
</p>
<p>department at Richmond which he employed in communicating with his agents in
</p>
<p>Canada, and which they employed in the letter of October 13, notifying him that " their
</p>
<p>friends would be set to work as he had directed '." The letter in cipher found in Booth's
</p>
<p>possession is translated here by the use of the cipher machine now in court, which, as
</p>
<p>the testimony of Mr. Dana shows, he brought from the rooms of Davis's state depart-
</p>
<p>ment in Richmond. Who gave Booth this secret cipher? Of what use was it to him if
</p>
<p>he was not in confederation with Davis?
</p>
<p>But there is one other item of testimony that ought, among honest and intelligent
</p>
<p>people at all conversant with this evidence, to end all further inquiry as to whether
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis was one of the parties, with Booth, as charged upon this record, in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy to assassinate the President and others. That is that on the fifth day after

<p>the assassination, in the city of Charlotte, N. C., a telegraphic despatch was received by
</p>
<p>him, at the house of Mr. Bates, from John C. Breckinridge, his rebel Secretary of War,
</p>
<p>which despatch is produced here, identified by the telegraph agent, and placed upon
</p>
<p>your record in the words following :
</p>
<p>"GREENSBORO', April 19, 1865.
</p>
<p>11 His 'Excellency President Davis :
</p>
<p>" President Lincoln was assassinated in the theatre in Washington on the night of
</p>
<p>the I4th inst. Seward's house was entered on the same night and he was repeatedly
</p>
<p>stabbed, and is probably mortally wounded.
</p>
<p>" JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE."
</p>
<p>At the time this despatch was handed to him, Davis was addressing a meeting from
</p>
<p>the steps of Mr. Bates's house, and after reading the despatch to the people, he said :
</p>
<p>"If it were to be done, it were belter it were well done." Shortly afterwards, in the
</p>
<p>house of the witness, in the same city, Breckinridge, having come to see Davis, stated
</p>
<p>his regret that the occurrence had happened, because he deemed it unfortunate for the
</p>
<p>people of the South at that time. Davis replied, referring to the assassination, " Well,
</p>
<p>general, I don't know; if it were to be done at all, it were better that it were well
</p>
<p>done; and if the same had been done to Andy Johnson, the beast, and to Secretary
</p>
<p>Stanton, the job would then be complete.' 1 ''
</p>
<p>Accomplished as this man was in all the arts of a conspirator, he was not equal to
</p>
<p>the task as happily, in the good providence of God, no mortal man is of conceal-
</p>
<p>ing, by any form of words, any great crime which he may have meditated or per-
</p>
<p>petrated either against his government or his fellow-men. It was doubtless furthest
</p>
<p>from Jefferson Davis's purpose to make confession, and yet he did make a confession.
</p>
<p>His guilt demanded utterance; that demand he could not resist; therefore his words
</p>
<p>proclaimed his guilt, in spite of his purpose to conceal it. He said, "if it were to be
</p>
<p>done, it were better it were well done." Would any man ignorant of the conspiracy be
</p>
<p>able to devise and fashion such a form of speech as that ? Had not the President been
</p>
<p>murdered? Had he not reason to believe that the Secretary of State had been mor-
</p>
<p>tally wounded? Yet he was not satisfied, but was compelled to say, " it were better
</p>
<p>it were well done " that is to say, all that had been agreed to be done had not been
</p>
<p>done. Two days afterwards, in his conversation with Breckinridge, he not only repeats
</p>
<p>the same form of expression, "if it were to be done it were better it were well done,"
</p>
<p>but adds these words: " And if the same had been done to Andy Johnson, the beast,

</p>
<p>and to Secretary Stanton, the job would then be complete." He would accept the assas-
</p>
<p>sination of the President, the Vice-President, of the Secretary of State, and the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of War, as a complete execution of the "job," which he had given out upon
</p>
<p>contract, and which he had " made all right," so far as the pay was concerned, by the
</p>
<p>despatches he had sent to Thompson by Surratt, one of his hired assassins. Whatever
</p>
<p>may be the conviction of others, my own conviction is that Jefferson Davis is as clearly
</p>
<p>proven guilty of this conspiracy as is John Wilkes Booth, by whose hand Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis inflicted the mortal wound upon Abraham Lincoln. His words of intense hate
</p>
<p>and rage and disappointment are not to be overlooked that the assassins had not
</p>
<p>done their work well; that they had not succeeded in robbing the people altogether of
</p>
<p>their constitutional Executive and his advisers; and hence he exclaims, " If they had
</p>
<p>killed Andy Johnson, the beast ! " Neither can he conceal his chagrin and disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment that the war minister of the republic, whose energy, incorruptible integrity,
</p>
<p>sleepless vigilance, and executive ability had organized day by day, month by month,.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 371
</p>
<p>and year by year, victory for our arms, had escaped the knife of the hired assassins.
</p>
<p>The job, says this procurer of assassination, was not well done; it had been better if
</p>
<p>it had been well done ! Because Abraham Lincoln had been clear in his great office,
</p>
<p>and had saved the nation's life by enforcing the nation's laws, this traitor declares he
</p>
<p>must be murdered; because Mr. Seward, as the foreign secretary of the country, had
</p>
<p>thwarted the purposes of treason to plunge his country into a war with England, he
</p>
<p>must be murdered; because, upon the murder of Mr. Lincoln, Andrew Johnson would
</p>
<p>succeed to the presidency, and because he had been true to the Constitution and gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, faithful found among the faithless of his own State, clinging to the falling
</p>
<p>pillars of the republic when others had fled, he must be murdered; and because the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War had taken care, by the faithful discharge of his duties, that the
</p>
<p>republic should live and not die, he must be murdered. Inasmuch as these two faithful
</p>
<p>officers were not also assassinated, assuming that the Secretary of State was mortally
</p>
<p>wounded, Davis could not conceal his disappointment and chagrin that the work was
</p>
<p>not " well done," that ." the job was not complete ! "
</p>
<p>Thus it appears by the testimony that the proposition made to Davis was to kill and
</p>
<p>murder the deadliest enemies of the Confederacy not to kidnap them, as is now pre-
</p>
<p>tended here; that by the declaration of Sanders, Tucker, Thompson, Clay, Cleary,
</p>
<p>Harper, and Young, the conspirators in Canada, the agreement and combination among
</p>
<p>them was to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, William H. Seward, Andrew Johnson,
</p>
<p>Ulysses S. Grant, Edwin M. Stanton, and others of his advisors, and not to kidnap
</p>
<p>them; it appears from every utterance of John Wilkes Booth, as well as from the
</p>
<p>Charles Selby letter, of which mention will presently be made, that, as early as Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, the proposition with him was to kill and murder, not to kidnap.
</p>
<p>Since the first examination of Conover, who testified, as the court will remember,
</p>
<p>to many important facts against these conspirators and agents of Davis in Canada
</p>
<p>among others, the terrible and fiendish plot disclosed by Thompson, Fallen, and others,
</p>
<p>that they had ascertained the volume of water in the reservoir supplying New York
</p>
<p>City, estimated the quantity of poison required to render it deadly, and intended thus
</p>
<p>to poison a whole city Conover returned to Canada, by direction of this court, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of obtaining certain documentary evidence. There, about the pth of June,
</p>
<p>he met Beverley Tucker, Sanders, and other conspirators, and conversed with them.-
</p>
<p>Tucker declared that Secretary Stanton, whom he denounced as " a scoundrel," and
</p>
<p>Judge Holt, whom he called " a bloodthirsty villain," "could protect themselves as long

</p>
<p>as they remained in office by a guard, but that would not always be the case, and, by
</p>
<p>the Eternal, he had a large account to settle with them." After this, the evidence of
</p>
<p>Conover here having been published, these parties called upon him and asked him
</p>
<p>whether he had been to Washington and had testified before this court. Conover
</p>
<p>denied it; they insisted, and took him to a room where, with drawn pistols, they com-
</p>
<p>pelled him to consent to make an affidavit that he had been falsely personated here by
</p>
<p>another, and that he would make that affidavit before a Mr. Kerr, who would witness it.
</p>
<p>They then called in Mr. Kerr to certify to the public that Conover had made such a denial.
</p>
<p>They also compelled this witness to furnish for publication an advertisement offering a
</p>
<p>reward of five hundred dollars for the arrest of the " infamous and perjured scoundrel "
</p>
<p>who had recently personated James W. Wallace under the name of Sanford Conover,
</p>
<p>and testified to a tissue of falsehoods before the military commission at Washington,
</p>
<p>which advertisement was published in the papers.
</p>
<p>To these facts Mr. Conover now testifies, and also discloses the fact that these same
</p>
<p>3/2 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>men published, in the report of the proceedings before Judge Smith, an affidavit pur-
</p>
<p>porting to be his, but which he never made. The affidavit which he in fact made, and
</p>
<p>which was published in a newspaper at that time, produced here, is set out substantially
</p>
<p>upon your record, and agrees with the testimony upon the same point given by him in
</p>
<p>this court.
</p>
<p>To suppose that Conover ever made such an affidavit voluntarily as the one wrung
</p>
<p>from him as stated is impossible. Would he advertise for his own arrest and charge
</p>
<p>himself with falsely personating himself? But the fact cannot evade observation, that
</p>
<p>when these guilty conspirators saw Conover's testimony before this court in the public
</p>
<p>prints, revealing to the world the atrocious plots of these felon conspirators, conscious
</p>
<p>of the truthfulness of his statements, they cast about at once for some defense before the
</p>
<p>public, and devised the foolish and stupid invention of compelling him to make an
</p>
<p>affidavit that he was not Sanford Conover, was not in this court, never gave this testi-
</p>
<p>mony, but was a practicing lawyer in Montreal ! This infamous proceeding, coupled
</p>
<p>with the evidence before detailed, stamps these ruffian plotters with the guilt 01 this
</p>
<p>conspiracy.
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth having entered into this conspiracy in Canada, as has been
</p>
<p>shown, as early as October, he is next found in the city of New York on the nth day,
</p>
<p>as I claim, of November, in disguise, in conversation with another, the conversation
</p>
<p>disclosing to the witness, Mrs. Hudspeth, that they had some matter of personal interest
</p>
<p>between them; that upon one of them the lot had fallen to go to Washington upon
</p>
<p>the other to go to New Berne. This witness, upon being shown the photograph of
</p>
<p>Booth, swears " that the face is the same " as that of one of those men, who, she says,
</p>
<p>was a young man of education and culture, as appeared by his conversation, and who
</p>
<p>had a scar like a bite near the jaw-bone. It is a fact proved here by the Surgeon Gen-
</p>
<p>eral that Booth had such a scar on the side of his neck. Mrs. Hudspeth heard him say
</p>
<p>he would leave for Washington the day after to-morrow. His companion appeared
</p>
<p>angry because it had not fallen on him to go to Washington. This took place after the
</p>
<p>presidential election in November. She cannot fix the precise date, but says she was
</p>
<p>told that General Butler left New York on that day. The testimony discloses that
</p>
<p>General Butler's army was on the nth of November leaving New York. The register
</p>
<p>of the National Hotel shows that Booth left Washington on the early morning train,
</p>
<p>November n, and that he returned to this city on the I4th. Chester testifies positively
</p>
<p>to Booth's presence in New York early in November. This testimony shows most con-

</p>
<p>clusively that Booth was in New York on the nth of November. The early morning
</p>
<p>train on which he left Washington would reach New York early in the afternoon of
</p>
<p>that day. Chester saw him there early in November, and Mrs. Hudspeth not only
</p>
<p>identifies his picture, but describes his person. The scar upon his neck near his jaw
</p>
<p>was peculiar and is well described by the witness as like a bite. On that day Booth
</p>
<p>had a letter in his possession which he accidentally dropped in a street car in the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of Mrs. Hudspeth, the witness, who delivered it to Major General Dix the same
</p>
<p>day, and by whom, as his letter on file before this court shows, the same was trans-
</p>
<p>mitted to the War Department, November 17, 1864. That letter contains these words:
</p>
<p>" DEAR Louis: The time has at last come that we have all so wished for, and
</p>
<p>upon you everything depends. As it was decided, before you left, we were to cast
</p>
<p>lots, we accordingly did so, and you are to be the Charlotte Corday of the nineteenth
</p>
<p>century. When you remember the fearful, solemn vow that was taken by us, you will
</p>
<p>feel there is no drawback. Abe must die, and now. You can choose your weapons
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 373
</p>
<p>the cup, ike knife, tke bullet. The cup failed us once, and might again. Johnson, who
</p>
<p>will give this, has been like an enraged demon since the meeting, because it has not
</p>
<p>fallen upon him to rid the world of the monster. . . . You know where to find
</p>
<p>your friends. Your disguises are so perfect and complete that without one knew your
</p>
<p>face no police telegraphic despatch would catch you. The English gentleman, liar-
</p>
<p>court, must not act hastily. Remember, he has ten days. Strike for your home, strike
</p>
<p>for your country ; bide your time, but strike sure. Get introduced; congratulate him;
</p>
<p>listen to his stories (not many more will the brute tell to earthly friends); do anything
</p>
<p>but fail, and meet us at the appointed place within the fortnight. You will probably
</p>
<p>hear from me in Washington. Sanders is doing us no good in Canada.
</p>
<p>"CHAS. SELBY."
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman (Mr. Cox), in his very able and carefully considered argu-
</p>
<p>ment in defense of O'Laughlin and Arnold, attached importance to this letter, and
</p>
<p>doubtless very clearly saw its bearing upon the case, and therefore undertook to show
</p>
<p>that the witness, Mrs. Hudspeth, must be mistaken as to the person of Booth. The gen-
</p>
<p>tleman assumes that the letter of General Dix, of the I7th of November last, transmit-
</p>
<p>ting this letter to the War Department, reads that the party who dropped the letter was
</p>
<p>heard to say that he would start to Washington on Friday night next, although the
</p>
<p>word " next " is not in the letter, neither is it in the quotation which the gentleman
</p>
<p>makes, for he quotes it fairly; yet he concludes that this would be the l8th of November.
</p>
<p>Now the fact is, the nth of November last was Friday, and the register of the
</p>
<p>National Hotel bears witness that Mrs. Hudspeth is not mistaken; because her language
</p>
<p>is, that Booth said he would leave for Washington day after to-morrow, which would be
</p>
<p>Sunday, the I3th, and if in the evening, would bring him to Washington on Monday,
</p>
<p>the I4th of November, the day on which, the register shows, he did return to the
</p>
<p>National Hotel. As to the improbability which the gentleman raises, on the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion happening in a street car, crowded with people, there was nothing that transpired,
</p>
<p>although the conversation was earnest, which enabled the witness, or could have enabled
</p>
<p>any one, in the absence of this letter or of the subsequent conduct of Booth, to form
</p>
<p>the least idea of the subject-matter of their conversation. The gentleman does not
</p>
<p>deal altogether fairly in his remarks touching the letter of General Dix, because, upon
</p>
<p>a careful examination of the letter, it will be found that he did not form any such judg-
</p>
<p>ment as that -it was a hoax for the Sunday Mercury ; but he took care to forward it to
</p>
<p>the Department, and asked attention to it, when, as appears by the testimony of the

</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of War, Mr. Dana, the letter was delivered to Mr. Lincoln, who
</p>
<p>considered it important enough to indorse it with the word "Assassination," and file it
</p>
<p>in his office, where it was found after the commission of this crime, and brought into
</p>
<p>this court to bear witness against his assassins.
</p>
<p>Although this letter would imply that the assassination spoken of was to take place
</p>
<p>speedily, yet the party was to bide his time. Though he had entered into the prelimi-
</p>
<p>nary arrangements in Canada, although conspirators had doubtless agreed to co-operate
</p>
<p>with him in the commission of the crime, and lots had been cast for the chief part in
</p>
<p>the bloody drama, yet it remained for him, as the leader and principal of the hired
</p>
<p>assassins, by whose hand their employers were to strike the murderous blow, to collect
</p>
<p>about him and bring to Washington such persons as would be willing to lend themselves
</p>
<p>for a price to the horrid crime, and likely to give the necessary aid and support in its
</p>
<p>consummation. The letter declares that Abraham Lincoln must die, and ncnv, meaning
</p>
<p>as soon as the agents can be employed and the work done. To that end you will bide
</p>
<p>your time. But, says the gentleman, it could not have been the same conspiracy
</p>
<p>374 ' APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>charged here to which this letter refers. Why not? It is charged here that Booth,
</p>
<p>with the accused and others, conspired to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln; that is
</p>
<p>precisely the conspiracy disclosed in the letter. Granted that the parties on trial had
</p>
<p>not then entered into the combination; if they at any time afterward entered into it
</p>
<p>they became parties to it, and the conspiracy was still the same. But, says the gentle-
</p>
<p>man, the words of the letter imply that the conspiracy was to be executed within the
</p>
<p>fortnight. Booth is directed, by the name of Louis, to meet the writer within the fort-
</p>
<p>night. It by no mearis follows that he was to strike within the fortnight, because he
</p>
<p>was to meet his co-conspirator within that time, and any such conclusion is excluded by
</p>
<p>the words, "Bide your time." Even if the conspiracy was to be executed within the
</p>
<p>fortnight, and was not so executed, and the same party, Booth, afterwards by concert
</p>
<p>and agreement with the accused and others, did execute it by " striking sure " and kill-
</p>
<p>ing the President, that act, whenever done, would be but the execution of the same
</p>
<p>conspiracy. The letter is conclusive evidence of so much of this conspiracy as relates
</p>
<p>to the murder of President Lincoln. As Booth was to do anything but fail, he immedi-
</p>
<p>ately thereafter sought out the agents to enable him to strike sure and execute all that
</p>
<p>he had agreed with Davis and his co-confederates in Canada to do to murder the
</p>
<p>President, the Secretary of State, the Vice-President, General Grant, and Secretary
</p>
<p>Stanton.
</p>
<p>Even Booth's co-conspirator, Payne, now on his trial, by his defense admits all this,
</p>
<p>and says Booth had just been to Canada, " was filled with a mighty scheme, and was
</p>
<p>lying in wait for agents." Booth asked the co-operation of the prisoner, Payne, and
</p>
<p>said: " I will give you as much money as you want; but first you must swear to stick
</p>
<p>by me. It is in the oil business." This you are told by the accused was early in March
</p>
<p>last. Thus guilt bears witness against itself.
</p>
<p>We find Booth in New York in November, December, and January, urging Chester
</p>
<p>to enter into this combination, assuring him that there was money in it; that they had
</p>
<p>"friends on the- other side "; that if he would only participate in it he would never
</p>
<p>want for money while he lived, and all that was asked of him was to stand at and open
</p>
<p>the back door of Ford's Theatre. Booth, in his interviews with Chester, confesses that
</p>
<p>he is without money himself, and allows Chester to reimburse him the fifty dollars which
</p>
<p>he (Booth) had transmitted to him in a letter for the purpose of paying his expenses to
</p>
<p>Washington as one of the parties to this conspiracy. Booth told him, although he him-
</p>
<p>self was penniless, "there is money in this we have friends on the other side "; and

<p>if you will but engage, I will have three thousand dollars deposited at once for the use
</p>
<p>of your family.
</p>
<p>Failing to secure the services of Chester, because his soul recoiled with abhorrence
</p>
<p>from the foul work of assassination and murder, he found more willing instruments in
</p>
<p>others whom he gathered about him. Men to commit the assassinations, horses to
</p>
<p>secure speedy and certain escape, were to be provided, and to this end Booth, with an
</p>
<p>energy worthy of a better cause, applies himself. For this latter purpose he told Chester
</p>
<p>he had already expended five thousand dollars. In the latter part of November, 1864,
</p>
<p>he visits Charles County, Md., and is in company with one of the prisoners, Dr.
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd, with whom he lodged over night, and through whom he procures of
</p>
<p>Gardner one of the several horses which were at his disposal and used by him and his
</p>
<p>co-conspirators in Washington on the night of the assassination.
</p>
<p>Some time in January last, it is in testimony that the prisoner Mudd introduced
</p>
<p>Booth to John H. Surratt and the witness Wiechmann; that Booth invited them to the
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 375
</p>
<p>National Hotel; that when there, in the room to which Booth took them, Mudd went out
</p>
<p>into the passage, called Booth out and had a private conversation with him, leaving the
</p>
<p>witness and Surratt in the room. Upon their return to the room, Booth went out with
</p>
<p>Surratt, and upon their coming in, all three Booth, Surratt, and Samuel A. Mudd
</p>
<p>went out together and had a conversation in the passage, leaving the witness alone.
</p>
<p>Up to the time of this interview it seems that neither the witness nor Surratt had any
</p>
<p>knowledge of Booth, as they were then introduced to him by Dr. Mudd. Whether
</p>
<p>Surratt had in fact previously known Booth it is not important to inquire. Mudd
</p>
<p>deemed it necessary, perhaps a wise precaution, to introduce Surratt to Booth; he also
</p>
<p>deemed it necessary to have a private conversation with Booth shortly afterwards, and
</p>
<p>directly upon that to have a conversation together with Booth and Surratt alone. Had
</p>
<p>this conversation, no part of which was heard by the witness, been perfectly innocent,
</p>
<p>it is not to be presumed that Dr. Mudd, who was an entire stranger to Wiechmann,
</p>
<p>would have deemed it necessary to hold the conversation secretly, nor to have volun-
</p>
<p>teered to tell the witness, or rather pretend to tell him, what the conversation was; yet
</p>
<p>he did say to the witness, upon their return to the room, by way of apology, I suppose,
</p>
<p>for the privacy of the conversation, that Booth had some private business with him and
</p>
<p>wished to purchase his farm. This silly device, as is often the case in attempts at
</p>
<p>deception, failed in the execution; for it remains to be shown how the fact that Mudd
</p>
<p>had private business with Booth, and that Booth wished to purchase his farm, made it
</p>
<p>at all necessary, or even proper, that they should both volunteer to call out Surratt,
</p>
<p>who, up to that moment, was a stranger to Booth. What had Surratt to do with Booth's
</p>
<p>purchase of Mudd's farm? And if it was necessary to withdraw and talk by themselves
</p>
<p>secretly about the sale of the farm, why should they disclose the fact to the very man
</p>
<p>from whom they had concealed it ?
</p>
<p>Upon the return of these three parties to the room, they seated themselves at a
</p>
<p>table, and upon the back of an envelope Booth traced lines with a pencil, indicating,
</p>
<p>as the witness states, the direction of roads. Why was this done? As Booth had been
</p>
<p>previously in that section of country, as the prisoner in his defense has taken great
</p>
<p>pains to show, it was certainly not necessary to anything connected with the purchase
</p>
<p>of Mudd's farm that at that time he should be indicating the direction of roads to or
</p>
<p>from it; nor is it made to appear, by anything in this testimony, how it comes that
</p>
<p>Surratt, as the witness testifies, seemed to be as much interested in the marking out of
</p>
<p>these roads as Mudd or Booth. It does not appear that Surratt was in any wise con-

<p>nected with or interested in the sale of Mudd's farm. From all that has transpired
</p>
<p>since this meeting at the hotel, it would seem that this plotting the roads was intended,
</p>
<p>not so much to show the road to Mudd's farm, as to point out the shortest and safest
</p>
<p>route for flight from the capital, by the houses of all the parties to this conspiracy, to
</p>
<p>their " friends on the other side."
</p>
<p>But, says the learned gentleman (Mr. Ewing), in his very able argument in defense
</p>
<p>of this prisoner, why should Booth determine that his flight should be through Charles
</p>
<p>County? The answer must be obvious, upon a moment's reflection, to every man, and
</p>
<p>could not possibly have escaped the notice of the counsel himself, but for the reason
</p>
<p>that his zeal for his client constrained him to overlook it. It was absolutely essential
</p>
<p>that this murderer should have his co-conspirators at convenient points along his route,
</p>
<p>and it does not appear in evidence that by the route to his friends, who had then fled
</p>
<p>from Richmond, which the gentleman (Mr. Ewing) indicates as the more direct, but of
</p>
<p>which there is not the slightest evidence whatever, Booth had co-conspirators at an
</p>
<p>3/6 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>equal distance from Washington. The testimony discloses, further, that on the route
</p>
<p>selected by him for his flight there is a large population that would be most likely to
</p>
<p>favor and aid him in the execution of his wicked purpose and in making his escape.
</p>
<p>But it is a sufficient answer to the gentleman's question that Booth's co-conspirator,
</p>
<p>Mudd, lived in Charles County.
</p>
<p>To return to the meeting at the hotel. In the light of other facts in this case, it
</p>
<p>must become clear to the court that this secret meeting between Booth, Surratt, and
</p>
<p>Mudd was a conference looking to the execution of this conspiracy. It so impressed
</p>
<p>the prisoner it so impressed his counsel, that they deemed it necessary and absolutely
</p>
<p>essential to their defense to attempt to destroy the credibility of the witness Wiechmann.
</p>
<p>I may say here, in passing, that they have not attempted to impeach his general
</p>
<p>reputation for truth by the testimony of a single witness, nor have they impeached his
</p>
<p>testimony by calling a single witness to discredit one material fact to which he has testi-
</p>
<p>fied in this issue. Failing to find a breath of suspicion against Wiechmann's character,
</p>
<p>or to contradict a single fact to which he testified, the accused had to fly to the last
</p>
<p>resort, an alibi, and very earnestly did the learned counsel devote himself to the task.
</p>
<p>It is not material whether this meeting in the hotel took place on the 23d of Decem-
</p>
<p>ber or in January. But, says the counsel, it was after the commencement or close of
</p>
<p>the Congressional holiday. That is not material; but the concurrent resolution of Con-
</p>
<p>gress shows that the holiday commenced on the 22d of December, the day before the
</p>
<p>accused spent the evening in Washington. The witness is not certain about the date of
</p>
<p>this meeting. The material fact is, did this meeting take place either on the 23d of
</p>
<p>December or in January last? Were the private interviews there held, and was the
</p>
<p>apology made, as detailed, by Mudd and Booth, after the secret conference, to the
</p>
<p>witness? That the meeting did take place, and that Mudd did explain that these secret
</p>
<p>interviews, with Booth first, and with Booth and Surratt directly afterward, had relation
</p>
<p>to the sale of his farm, is confessedly admitted by the endeavor of the prisoner, through
</p>
<p>his counsel, to show that negotiations had been going on between Booth and Mudd for
</p>
<p>the sale of Mudd's farm. If no such meeting was held, if no such explanation was
</p>
<p>made by Mudd to Wiechmann, can any man for a moment believe that a witness would
</p>
<p>have been called here to give any testimony about Booth having negotiated for Mudd's
</p>
<p>farm? What conceivable connection has it with this case, except to show that Mudd's
</p>
<p>explanation to Wiechmann for his extraordinary conduct was in exact accordance with
</p>
<p>the fact? Or was this testimony about the negotiations for Mudd's farm intended to

</p>
<p>show so close an intimacy and intercourse with Booth that Mudd could not fail to rec-
</p>
<p>ognize him when he came flying for aid to his house from the work of assassination?
</p>
<p>It would be injustice to the able counsel to suppose that.
</p>
<p>I have said that it was wholly immaterial whether this conversation took place on
</p>
<p>the 23d of December or in January; it is in evidence that in both these months Booth
</p>
<p>was at the National Hotel; that he occupied a room there; that he arrived there on the
</p>
<p>22d and was there on the 23d of December last, and also on the I2th day of January.
</p>
<p>The testimony of the witness is, that Booth said he had just come in. Suppose this
</p>
<p>conversation took place in December, on the evening of the 23d, the time when it is
</p>
<p>proved by J. T. Mudd, the witness for the accused, that he, in company with Samuel
</p>
<p>A. Mudd, spent the night in Washington City. Is there anything in the testimony of
</p>
<p>that or any other witness to show that the accused did not have and could not have had
</p>
<p>an interview with Booth on that evening? J. T. Mudd testifies that he separated from
</p>
<p>the prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd, at the National Hotel early in the evening of that day,
</p>
<p>APPENDIX, 377
</p>
<p>and did not meet him again until the accused came in for the night at the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>House, where he stopped. Where was Dr. Samuel A. Mudd during this interval?
</p>
<p>What does his witness know about him during that time? How can he say that Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd did not go up on Seventh Street in company with Booth, then at the National;
</p>
<p>that he did not on Seventh Street meet Surratt and Wiechmann; that he did not return
</p>
<p>to the National Hotel; that he did not have this interview, and afterwards meet him, the
</p>
<p>witness, as he testifies, at the Pennsylvania House? Who knows that the Congressional
</p>
<p>holiday had not in fact commenced on that day ? What witness has been called to prove
</p>
<p>that Booth did not on either of those occasions occupy the room that had formerly been
</p>
<p>occupied by a member of Congress, who had temporarily vacated it, leaving his books
</p>
<p>there? Wiechmann, I repeat, is not positive as to the date, he is only positive as to
</p>
<p>the fact; and he disclosed voluntarily to this court that the date could probably be fixed
</p>
<p>by a reference to the register of the Pennsylvania House; that register cannot, of
</p>
<p>course, be conclusive of whether Mudd was there in January or not, for the very good
</p>
<p>reason that the proprietor admits that he did not know Samuel A. Mudd, therefore
</p>
<p>Mudd might have registed by any other name. Wiechmann does not pretend to know
</p>
<p>that Mudd had registered at all. If Mudd was here in January, as a party to this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, it is not at all unlikely that, if he did register at that time in the presence of a
</p>
<p>man to whom he was wholly unknown, his kinsman not then being with him, he would
</p>
<p>register by a false name. But if the interview took place in December, the testimony
</p>
<p>of Wiechmann bears as strongly against the accused as if it had happened in January.
</p>
<p>Wiechmann says he does not know what time was occupied in this interview at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel; that it probably 'lasted twenty minutes; that, after the private inter-
</p>
<p>views between Mudd and Surratt and Booth, which were not of very long duration,
</p>
<p>had terminated, the parties went to the Pennsylvania House, where Dr. Mudd had
</p>
<p>rooms, and after sitting together in the common sitting-room of the hotel, they left Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd there about ten o'clock P.M., who remained during the night. Wiechmann's
</p>
<p>testimony leaves no doubt that this meeting on Seventh Street and interview at the
</p>
<p>National took place after dark, and terminated before or about ten o'clock P.M. His
</p>
<p>own witness, J. T. Mudd, after stating that he separated from the accused at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel, says after he had got through a conversation with a gentleman of his
</p>
<p>acquaintance, he walked down the Avenue, went to several clothing stores, and " after
</p>
<p>awhile" walked round to the Pennsylvania House, and "very soon after" he got
</p>
<p>there Dr. Mudd came in, and they went to bed shortly afterwards. What time he

</p>
<p>spent in his "walk alone" on the Avenue, looking at clothing; what period he
</p>
<p>embraces in the terms "after a while," when he returned to the Pennsylvania House,
</p>
<p>and "soon after" which Dr. Mudd got there, the witness does not disclose. Neither
</p>
<p>does he intimate, much less testify, that he saw Dr. Mudd when he first entered the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania House on that night after their separation. How does he. know that Booth
</p>
<p>and Surratt and Wiechmann did not accompany Samuel A. Mudd to that house that
</p>
<p>evening? How does he know that the prisoner and those persons did not converse
</p>
<p>together some time in the sitting-room of the Pennsylvania Hotel ? Jeremiah Mudd
</p>
<p>has not testified that he met Dr. Mudd in that room, or that he was in it himself. He
</p>
<p>has, however, sworn to the fact, which is disproved by no one, that the prisoner was
</p>
<p>separated from him long enough that evening to have had the meeting with Booth,
</p>
<p>Surratt, and Wiechmann, and the interviews in the National Hotel, and at the Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania House, to which Wiechmann has testified? Who is there to disprove it? Of
</p>
<p>what importance is it whether it was on the 23d day of December or in January? How
</p>
<p>3 /S APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>does that affect the credibility of Wiechmann? He is a man, as I have before said,
</p>
<p>against whose reputation for truth and good conduct they have not been able to bring
</p>
<p>one witness. If this meeting did by possibility take place that night, is there anything
</p>
<p>to render it improbable that Booth and Mudd and Surratt did have the conversation at
</p>
<p>the National Hotel to which Wiechmann testifies? Of what avail, therefore, is the
</p>
<p>attempt to prove that Mudd was not here during January, if it was clear that he was
</p>
<p>here on the 23d of December, 1864, and had this conversation with Booth? That this
</p>
<p>attempt to prove an alibi during January has failed, is quite as clear as is the proof of
</p>
<p>the fact that the prisoner was here on the evening of the 23d of December, and present
</p>
<p>in the National Hotel, where Booth stopped. The fact that the prisoner, Samuel A.
</p>
<p>Mudd, went with J. T. Mudd on that evening to the National Hotel, and there sepa-
</p>
<p>rated from him, is proved by his own witness, J. T. Mudd; and that he did not rejoin
</p>
<p>him until they retired to bed in the Pennsylvania House is proved by the same witness
</p>
<p>and contradicted by nobody. Does any one suppose there would have been such
</p>
<p>assiduous care to prove that the prisoner was with his kinsman all the time on the 23d
</p>
<p>of December, in Washington, if they had not known that Booth was then at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel, and that a meeting of the prisoner with Booth, Surratt, and Wiech-
</p>
<p>mann on that day would corroborate and confirm Wiechmann's testimony in every
</p>
<p>material statement he made concerning that meeting?
</p>
<p>The accused having signally failed to account for his absence after he separated from
</p>
<p>his witness, J. T. Mudd, early in the evening of the 23d of December, at the National
</p>
<p>Hotel, until they had again met at the Pennsylvania House, when they retired to rest,
</p>
<p>he now attempts to prove an alibi as to the month of January. In this he has failed,
</p>
<p>as he failed in the attempt to show that he could not have met Booth, Surratt, and
</p>
<p>Wiechmann on the 23d of December.
</p>
<p>For this purpose the accused calls Betty Washington. She had been at Mudd's
</p>
<p>house every night since the Monday after Christmas last, except when here at court,
</p>
<p>and says that the prisoner, Mudd, has only been away from home three nights during
</p>
<p>that time. This witness forgets that Mudd has not been at home any night or day since
</p>
<p>this court assembled. Neither does she account for the three nights in which she swears
</p>
<p>to his absence from home. First, she says he went to Gardner's party; second, he
</p>
<p>went to Giesboro, then to Washington. She does not know in what month he was
</p>
<p>away, the second time, all night. She only knows where he went from what he and
</p>
<p>his wife said, which is not evidence; but she does testify that when he left home and

</p>
<p>was absent over night the second time, it was about two or three weeks after she came
</p>
<p>to his house, which would, if it were three weeks, make it just about the I5th of Jan-
</p>
<p>uary, 1865; because she swears she came to his house on the first Monday after Christ-
</p>
<p>mas last, which was the 26th day of December; so that the I5th of January would be
</p>
<p>three weeks, less one day, from that time; and it might have been a week' earlier
</p>
<p>according to her testimony, as, also, it might have been a week earlier, or more, by
</p>
<p>Wiechmann's testimony, for he is not positive as to the time. What I have said of the
</p>
<p>register of the Pennsylvania House, the headquarters of Mudd and Atzerodt, I need
</p>
<p>not here repeat. That record proves nothing, save that Dr. Mudd was there on the
</p>
<p>23d of December, which, as we have seen, is a fact, along with others, to show that
</p>
<p>the meeting at the National then took place. I have also called the attention of the
</p>
<p>court to the fact that if Mudd was at that house again in January, and did not register
</p>
<p>his name, that fact proves nothing; or, if he did, the register only proves that he regis-
</p>
<p>tered falsely; either of which facts might have happened without the knowledge of the
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 379
</p>
<p>-witness called by the accused from that house, who does not know Samuel A. Mudd
</p>
<p>personally.
</p>
<p>The testimony of Henry L. Mudd, his brother, in support of this alibi, is, that the
</p>
<p>prisoner was in Washington on the 23d of March, and on the loth of April, four days
</p>
<p>before the murder ! But he does not account for the absent night in January, about
</p>
<p>which Betty Washington testifies. Thomas Davis was called for the same purpose, but
</p>
<p>stated that he was himself absent one night in January, after the gth of that month,
</p>
<p>and he could not say whether Mudd was there on that night or not. He does testify to
</p>
<p>Mudd's absence over night three times, and fixes one occasion on the night of the 26th
</p>
<p>of January. In consequence of his own absence one night in January, this witness
</p>
<p>cannot account for the absence of Mudd on the night referred to by Betty Washington.
</p>
<p>This matter is entitled to no further attention. It can satisfy no one, and the burden
</p>
<p>of proof is upon the prisoner to prove that he was not in Washington in January last.
</p>
<p>How can such testimony convince any rational man that Mudd was not here in January,
</p>
<p>against the evidence of an unimpeached witness, who swears that Samuel A. Mudd was
</p>
<p>in Washington in the month of January? Who that has been examined here as a
</p>
<p>witness knows that he was not?
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Evans swears that he saw him in Washington last winter, and that at
</p>
<p>the same time he saw Jarboe, the one coming out of, and the other going into, a house
</p>
<p>on H Street, which he was informed on inquiry was the house of Mrs. Surratt. Jarboe
</p>
<p>is the only witness called to contradict Mr. Evans, and he leaves it in extreme doubt
</p>
<p>whether he does not corroborate him, as he swears that he was here himself last winter
</p>
<p>or fall, but cannot state exactly the time. Jarboe's silence on questions touching his
</p>
<p>own credibility leaves no room for any one to say that his testimony could impeach
</p>
<p>Mr. Evans, whatever he might swear.
</p>
<p>Miss Anna H. Surratt is also called for the purpose of impeaching Mr. Evans. It
</p>
<p>is sufficient to say of her testimony on that point that she swears negatively only that
</p>
<p>she does not see either of the persons named at her mother's house. This testimony
</p>
<p>neither disproves, nor does it even tend to disprove, the fact put in issue by Mr. Evans.
</p>
<p>No one will pretend, whatever the form of her expression in giving her testimony, that
</p>
<p>she could say more than that she did not know the fact, as it was impossible that she
</p>
<p>could know who was, or who was not, at her mother's house, casually, at a period so
</p>
<p>remote. It is not my purpose, neither is it needful here, to question in any way the
</p>
<p>integrity of this young woman.

</p>
<p>It is further in testimony that Samuel A. Mudd was here on the 3d day of March
</p>
<p>last, the day preceding the inauguration, when Booth was to strike the traitorous blow;
</p>
<p>and it was, doubtless, only by the interposition of that God who stands within the
</p>
<p>shadow and keeps watch above his own, that the victim of this conspiracy was spared
</p>
<p>that day from the assassin's hand that he might complete his work and see the salvation
</p>
<p>of his country in the fall of Richmond and the surrender of its great army. Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>was here on that day (the 3d of March) to abet, to encourage, to nerve his co-conspira-
</p>
<p>tor for the commission of this great crime. He was carried away by the awful purpose
</p>
<p>which possessed him, and rushed into the room of Mr. Norton, at the National Hotel, in
</p>
<p>search of Booth, exclaiming excitedly: " I'm mistaken; I thought this was Mr. Booth's
</p>
<p>room." He is told Mr. Booth is above, on the next floor. He is followed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Norton, because of his rude and excited behavior, and being followed, conscious of his
</p>
<p>guilty errand, he turns away, afraid of himself and afraid to be found in concert with
</p>
<p>his fellow confederate. Mr. Norton identifies the prisoner, and has no doubt that
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd is the man.
</p>
<p>380 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Evans also swears that, after the 1st and before the 4th day of March
</p>
<p>last, he is certain that within that time, and on the 2d or 3d of March, he saw Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>drive into Washington City. The endeavor is made by the accused in order to break
</p>
<p>down this witness, by proving another alibi. The sister of the accused, Miss Fanny
</p>
<p>Mudd, is called. She testifies that she saw the prisoner at breakfast in her father's
</p>
<p>house, on the 2d of March, about five o'clock in the morning, and not again until the
</p>
<p>3d of March at noon. Mrs. Emily Mudd swears substantially to the same statement.
</p>
<p>Betty Washington, called for the accused, swears that he was at home all day at work
</p>
<p>with her on the 2d of March, and took breakfast at home. Frank Washington swears
</p>
<p>that Mudd was at home all day; that he saw him when he first came out in the morning
</p>
<p>about sunrise from his own house, and knows that he was there all day with them.
</p>
<p>Which is correct, the testimony of his sisters or the testimony of his servants? The
</p>
<p>sisters say that he was at their father's house for breakfast on the morning of the 2d of
</p>
<p>March; the servants say he was at home for breakfast with them on that day. If this
</p>
<p>testimony is followed, it proves one alibi too much. It is impossible, in the nature of
</p>
<p>things, that the testimony of all these four witnesses can be true.
</p>
<p>Seeing this weakness in the testimony brought to prove this second alibi, the
</p>
<p>endeavor is next made to discredit Mr. Norton for truth; and two witnesses, not more,
</p>
<p>are called, who testify that his reputation for truth has suffered by contested litigation
</p>
<p>between one of the impeaching witnesses and others. Four witnesses are called, who
</p>
<p>testify that Mr. Norton's reputation for truth is very good; that he is a man of high
</p>
<p>character for truth, and entitled to be believed whether he speaks under the obligation
</p>
<p>of an oath or not. The late Postmaster General, Hon. Horatio King, not only sustains
</p>
<p>Mr. Norton as a man of good reputation for truth, but expressly corroborates his testi-
</p>
<p>mony, by stating that in March last, about the 4th of March, Mr. Norton told him the
</p>
<p>same fact to which he swears here: that a man came into his room under excitement,
</p>
<p>alarmed his sister, was followed out by himself, and went down stairs instead of going
</p>
<p>up; and that Mr. Norton told him this before the assassination, and about the time of the
</p>
<p>inauguration. What motive had Mr. Norton at that time to fabricate this statement?
</p>
<p>It detracts nothing from his testimony that he did not at that time mention the name of
</p>
<p>this man to his friend, Mr. King; because it appears from his testimony and there is
</p>
<p>none to question the truthfulness of his statement that at that time he did not know
</p>
<p>his name. Neither does it take from the force of this testimony, that Mr. Norton did
</p>
<p>not, in communicating this matter to Mr. King, make mention of Booth's name;

</p>
<p>because there was nothing in the transaction, at the time, he being ignorant of the name
</p>
<p>of Mudd, and equally ignorant of the conspiracy between Mudd and Booth, to give the
</p>
<p>least occasion for any mention of Booth or of the transaction further than as he detailed
</p>
<p>it. With such corroboration, who can doubt the fact that Mudd did enter the room of
</p>
<p>Mr. Norton, and was followed by him, on the 3d of March last? Can he be mistaken
</p>
<p>in the man? Whoever looks at the prisoner carefully once will be sure to recognize
</p>
<p>him again.
</p>
<p>For the present I pass from the consideration of the testimony showing Dr. Mudd's
</p>
<p>connection with Booth in this conspiracy, with the remark that it is in evidence, and I
</p>
<p>think established, both by the testimony adduced by the prosecution and that by the
</p>
<p>prisoner, that since the commencement of this rebellion, John H. Surratt visited the
</p>
<p>prisoner's house; that he concealed Surratt and other rebels and traitors in the woods
</p>
<p>near his house, where for several days he furnished them with food and bedding; that
</p>
<p>the shelter of the woods by night ;md by day was the only shelter that the prisoner dare
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 381
</p>
<p>furnish these friends of his; that in November, Booth visited him and remained over
</p>
<p>night; that he accompanied Booth at that time to Gardner's, from whom he purchased
</p>
<p>one of the horses used on the night of the assassination to aid the escape of one of his
</p>
<p>confederates; that the prisoner had secret interviews with Booth and Surratt, as sworn
</p>
<p>to by the witness Wiechmann, in the National Hotel, whether on the ajd of December
</p>
<p>or in January is a matter of entire indifference; that he rushed into Mr. Norton's room
</p>
<p>on the 3d of March in search of Booth; and that he was here again on the loth of
</p>
<p>April, four days before the murder of the President. Of his conduct after the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the President, which is confirmatory of all this his conspiring with Booth and
</p>
<p>his sheltering, concealing, and aiding the flight of his co-conspirator, this felon assassin
</p>
<p>I shall speak hereafter, leaving him for the present with the remark that the attempt
</p>
<p>to prove his character has resulted in showing him in sympathy with the rebellion, so
</p>
<p>cruel that he shot one of his slaves and declared his purpose to send several of them to
</p>
<p>work on the rebel batteries in Richmond.
</p>
<p>What others, besides Samuel A. Mudd and John H. Surratt and Lewis Payne, did
</p>
<p>Booth, after his return from Canada, induce to join him in this conspiracy to murder the
</p>
<p>President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of State, and the Lieutenant General, with
</p>
<p>the intent thereby to aid the rebellion and overthrow the government and laws of the
</p>
<p>United States?
</p>
<p>On the loth of February the prisoners Arnold and O'Laughlin came to Washington
</p>
<p>and took rooms in the house of Mrs. Vantyne; were armed; were then visited
</p>
<p>frequently by John Wilkes Booth, and alone; were occasionally absent when Booth
</p>
<p>called, who seemed anxious for their return would sometimes leave notes for them,
</p>
<p>and sometimes a request that when they came in they should be told to come to the
</p>
<p>stable. On the i8th of March last, when Booth played in "The Apostate," the
</p>
<p>witness, Mrs. Vantyne, received from O'Laughlin complimentary tickets. These
</p>
<p>persons remained there until the 2oth of March. They were visited, so far as the
</p>
<p>witness knows, during their stay at her house only by Booth, save that on a single
</p>
<p>occasion an unknown man came to see them, and remained with them over night.
</p>
<p>They told the witness they were in the " oil business." With Mudd, the guilty purpose
</p>
<p>was sought to be concealed by declaring that he was in the "land business"; with
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin and Arnold it was attempted to be concealed by the pretence that they
</p>
<p>were in the " oil business." Booth, it is proved, had closed up all connection with oil
</p>
<p>business last September. There is not a word of testimony to show that the accused,

<p>O'Laughlin and Arnold, ever invested or sought to invest, in any way or to any
</p>
<p>amount, in the oil business; their silly words betray them; they forgot when they
</p>
<p>uttered that false statement that truth is strong, next to the Almighty, and that their
</p>
<p>crime must find them out was the irrevocable and irresistible law of nature and of
</p>
<p>nature's God.
</p>
<p>One of their co-conspirators, known as yet only to the guilty parties to this damnable
</p>
<p>plot and to the Infinite, who will unmask and avenge all blood-guiltiness, comes to bear
</p>
<p>witness, unwittingly, against them. This unknown conspirator, who dates his letter at
</p>
<p>South Branch Bridge, April 6, 1865, mailed and postmarked Cumberland, Md., and
</p>
<p>addressed to John Wilkes Booth, by his initials, " J. W. B., National Hotel, Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, D.C.," was also in the " oil speculation." In that letter he says:
</p>
<p>" FRIEND WILKES: I received yours of March I2th, and reply as soon as practica-
</p>
<p>ble. I saw French, Brady, and others about the oil speculation. The subscription to
</p>
<p>the stock amounts to eight thousand dollars, and I add one thousand myself, which is
</p>
<p>382 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>about all I can stand. Now, when you sink your well, go deep enough; don't fail,-
</p>
<p>everything depends upon you and your helpers. If you cannot get through on your trip
</p>
<p>after you strike oil, strike through Thornton gap and across by Capon, Romney, and
</p>
<p>down the Branch. I can keep you safe from all hardships for a year. I am clear of
</p>
<p>all surveillance now that infernal Purdy is beat. . .
</p>
<p>" I send this by Tom, and if he don't get drunk you will get it the Qth. At all
</p>
<p>events, it cannot be understood 'if lost. . . .
</p>
<p>" No more, only Jake will be at Green's with the funds. (Signed) " LON."
</p>
<p>That this letter is not a fabrication is made apparent by the testimony of Purdy,
</p>
<p>whose name occurs in the letter. He testified that he had been a detective in the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment service, and that he had been falsely accused, as the letter recites, and put
</p>
<p>under arrest; that there was a noted rebel, by the name of Green, living at Thornton
</p>
<p>gap; that there was a servant, who drank, known as "Tom," in the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>South Branch Bridge; that there is an obscure route through the gap, and as described
</p>
<p>in the letter; and that a man commonly called " Lon " lives at South Branch Bridge.
</p>
<p>If the court are satisfied and it is for them to judge that this letter was written
</p>
<p>before the assassination, as it purports to have been, and on the day of its date, there
</p>
<p>can be no question with any one who reads it that the writer was in the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and knew that the time of its execution drew nigh. If a conspirator, every word of
</p>
<p>its contents is evidence against every other party to this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Who can fail to understand this letter? His words, "go deep enough," "don't
</p>
<p>fail," " everything depends on you and your helpers," "if you can't get through on
</p>
<p>your trip after you strike oil, strike through Thornton gap," etc., and " I can keep you
</p>
<p>safe from all hardships for a year," necessarily imply that when he " strikes oil" there
</p>
<p>will be an occasion for a flight ; that a trip, or route, has already been determined
</p>
<p>upon; that he may not be able to go through by that route; in which event he is to
</p>
<p>strike for Thornton gap, and across by Capon and Romney, and down the branch, for
</p>
<p>the shelter which his co-conspirator offers him. " I am clear of all serveillance now "
</p>
<p>does any one doubt that the man who wrote those words wished to assure Booth that
</p>
<p>he was no longer watched, and that Booth could safely hide with him from his pursuers?
</p>
<p>Does any one doubt, from the further expression in this letter, " Jake will be at Green's
</p>
<p>with the funds," that this was a part of the price of blood, or that the eight thousand
</p>
<p>dollars subscribed by others, and the one thousand additional, subscribed by the writer,
</p>
<p>were also a part of the price to be paid?

<p>" The oil business, " which was the declared business of O'Laughlin and Arnold,
</p>
<p>was the declared business of the infamous writer of this letter; was the declared busi-
</p>
<p>ness of John H. Surratt; was the declared business of Booth himself, as explained to
</p>
<p>Chester and Payne; was " the business " referred to in his telegrams to O'Laughlin, and
</p>
<p>meant the murder of the President, of his cabinet, and of General Grant. The first of
</p>
<p>these telegrams is dated Washington, I3th March, and is addressed to M. O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>No. 57 North Exeter Street, Baltimore, Md., and is as follows: "Don't you fear to
</p>
<p>neglect your business; you had better come on at once. J. Booth." The tele-
</p>
<p>graphic operator, Hoffman, who sent this despatch from Washington, swears that John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth delivered it to him in person on the day of its date; and the handwriting
</p>
<p>of the original telegram is established beyond question to be that of Booth. The other
</p>
<p>telegram is dated Washington, March 27, addressed, " M. O'Laughlin, Esq., 57 North
</p>
<p>Exeter Street, Baltimore, Md.," and is as follows: " Get word to Sam. Come on with
</p>
<p>or without him on Wednesday morning. We sell that day sure; don't fail. J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth." The original of this telegram is also proved to be in the handwriting of
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 383;
</p>
<p>Booth. The sale referred to in this last telegram was doubtless the murder of the
</p>
<p>President and others the "oil speculation," in which the writer of the letter from
</p>
<p>South Branch Bridge, dated April 6, had taken a thousand dollars, and in which Booth
</p>
<p>said there was money, and Sanders said there was money, and Atzerodt said there was
</p>
<p>money. The words of this telegram, "get word to Sam," mean Samuel Arnold, his
</p>
<p>co-conspirator, who had been with him during all his stay in Washington, at Mrs. Van-
</p>
<p>tyne's. These parties to this conspiracy, after they had gone to Baltimore, had addi-
</p>
<p>tional correspondence with Booth, which the court must infer had relation to carrying
</p>
<p>out the purposes of their confederation and agreement. The colored witness, Williams,
</p>
<p>testifies that John Wilkes Booth handed him a letter for Michael O'Laughlin, and another
</p>
<p>for Samuel Arnold, in Baltimore, some time in March last; one of which he delivered
</p>
<p>to O'Laughlin at the theatre in Baltimore, and the other to a lady at the door where
</p>
<p>Arnold boarded in Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Their agreement and co-operation in the common object having been thus estab-
</p>
<p>lished, the letter written to Booth by the prisoner Arnold, dated March 27, 1865, the
</p>
<p>handwriting of which is proved before the court, and which was found in Booth's pos-
</p>
<p>session after the assassination, becomes testimony against O'Laughlin, as well as against
</p>
<p>the writer Arnold, because it is an act done in furtherance of their combination. That
</p>
<p>letter is as follows :
</p>
<p>" DEAR JOHN: Was business so important that you could not remain in Baltimore
</p>
<p>till I saw you? I came in as soon as I could, but found you had gone to Washington.
</p>
<p>I called also to see Mike, but learned from his mother he had gone out with you and
</p>
<p>had not returned. I concluded, therefore, he had gone with you. How inconsiderate
</p>
<p>you have been ! When I left you, you stated that we would not meet in a month or so,
</p>
<p>and therefore I made application for employment, an answer to which I shall receive
</p>
<p>during the week. I told my parents I had ceased with you. Can I, then, under exist-
</p>
<p>ing circumstances, act as you request? You know full well that the government
</p>
<p>suspicions something is going on there, therefore the undertaking is becoming more
</p>
<p>complicated. Why not, for the present, desist? for various reasons, which, if you
</p>
<p>look into, you can readily see without my making any mention thereof. You, nor any
</p>
<p>one, can censure me for my present course. You have been its cause, for how can I
</p>
<p>now come after telling them I had left you? Suspicion rests upon me now from my
</p>
<p>whole family, and even parties in the country. I will be compelled to leave home any
</p>
<p>how, and how soon I care not. None, no, not one, were more in favor of the enter-

<p>prise than myself, and to-day would be there had you not done as you have. By this I
</p>
<p>mean manner of proceeding. I am, as you well know, in need. I am, you may say,,
</p>
<p>in rags, whereas, to-day, I ought to be well clothed. I do not feel right stalking about
</p>
<p>with means, and more from appearances a beggar. I feel my dependence. But even
</p>
<p>all this would have been, and was, forgotten, for I was one with you. Time more pro-
</p>
<p>pitious will arrive yet. Do not act rashly or in haste. I would prefer your first query,.
</p>
<p>' Go and see how it will be taken in Richmond,' and ere long I shall be better prepared
</p>
<p>to again be with you. I dislike writing. Would sooner verbally make known my views.
</p>
<p>Yet your now waiting causes me thus to proceed. Do not in anger peruse this. Weigh
</p>
<p>all I have said, and, as a rational man and a friend, you cannot censure or upbraid my
</p>
<p>conduct. I sincerely trust this, nor aught else that shall or may occur, will ever be an
</p>
<p>obstacle to obliterate our former friendship and attachment. Write me to Baltimore,,
</p>
<p>as I expect to be in about Wednesday or Thursday; or, if you can possibly come on, I
</p>
<p>will Tuesday meet you at Baltimore at B.
</p>
<p>" Ever I subscribe myself, your friend, "SAM."
</p>
<p>Here is the confession of the prisoner Arnold, that he was one with Booth in this
</p>
<p>conspiracy; the further confession that they are suspected by the government of their
</p>
<p>country, and the acknowledgment that since they parted Booth had communicated,
</p>
<p>among other things, a suggestion which leads to the remark in this letter, " I would
</p>
<p>384 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>prefer your first query, ' Go and see how it will be taken at Richmond,' and ere long I
</p>
<p>shall be better prepared to again be with you." This is a declaration that affects Arnold,
</p>
<p>Booth, and O'Laughlin alike, if the court are satisfied, and it is difficult to see how they
</p>
<p>can have doubt on the subject, that the matter to be referred to Richmond is the matter
</p>
<p>of the assassination of the President and others, to effect which these parties had pre-
</p>
<p>viously agreed and conspired together. It is a matter in testimony, by the declaration
</p>
<p>of John H. Surratt, who is as clearly proved to have been in this conspiracy and murder
</p>
<p>as Booth himself, that about the very date of this letter, the 27th of March, upon the
</p>
<p>suggestion of Booth, and with his knowledge and consent, he went to Richmond, not
</p>
<p>only to see "how it would be taken there," but to get funds with which to carry out
</p>
<p>the enterprise, as Booth had already declared to Chester in one of his last interviews,
</p>
<p>when he said that he or " some one of the party " would be constrained to go to Rich-
</p>
<p>mond for funds to carry out the conspiracy. Surratt returned from Richmond, bringing
</p>
<p>with him some part of the money for which he went, and was then going to Canada,
</p>
<p>and, as the testimony discloses, bringing with him the despatches from Jefferson Davis
</p>
<p>to his chief agents in Canada, which, as Thompson declared to Conover, made the
</p>
<p>proposed assassination " all right." Surratt, after seeing the parties here, left imme-
</p>
<p>diately for Canada and delivered his despatches to Jacob Thompson, the agent of
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis. This was done by Surratt upon the suggestion, or in exact accordance
</p>
<p>with the suggestion, of Arnold, made on the 27th of March in his letter to Booth just
</p>
<p>read, and yet you are gravely told that four weeks before the 27th of March Arnold
</p>
<p>had abandoned the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Surratt reached Canada with these despatches, as we have seen, about the 6th or 7th
</p>
<p>of April last, when the witness Conover saw them delivered to Jacob Thompson and
</p>
<p>heard their contents stated by Thompson, and the declaration from him that these
</p>
<p>despatches made it "all right." That Surratt was at that time in Canada is not
</p>
<p>only established by the testimony of Conover, but it is also in evidence that he told
</p>
<p>Wiechmann on the jd of April that he was going to Canada, and on that day left for
</p>
<p>Canada, and afterwards, two letters addressed by Surratt over the fictitious signature of
</p>
<p>John Harrison, to his mother and to Miss Ward, dated at Montreal, were received by
</p>
<p>them on the I4th of April, as testified by Wiechmann and by Miss Ward, a witness
</p>
<p>called for the defense. Thus it appears that the condition named by Arnold in his
</p>
<p>letter had been complied with'. Booth had "gone to Richmond," in the person of
</p>
<p>Surratt, "to see how it would be taken." The rebel authorities at Richmond had

</p>
<p>approved it, the agent had returned; and Arnold was, in his own words, thereby the
</p>
<p>better prepared to rejoin Booth in the prosecution of this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>To this end Arnold went to Fortress Monroe. As his letter expressly declares,
</p>
<p>Booth said when they parted, " we would not meet in a month or so, and therefore I
</p>
<p>made application for employment an answer to which I shall receive during the week."
</p>
<p>He did receive the answer that week from Fortress Monroe, and went there to await
</p>
<p>the "more propitious time," bearing with him the weapon of death which Booth had
</p>
<p>provided, and ready to obey his call, as the act had been approved at Richmond and
</p>
<p>been made " all right." Acting upon the same fact that the conspiracy had been
</p>
<p>approved in Richmond and the funds provided, O'Laughlin came to Washington to
</p>
<p>identify General Grant, the person who was to become the victim of his violence in the
</p>
<p>final consummation of this crime General Grant, whom, as is averred in the specifi-
</p>
<p>cation, it had become the part of O'Laughlin by his agreement in this conspiracy to kill
</p>
<p>and murder. On the evening preceding the assassination the 1 3th of April by the
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>385
</p>
<p>testimony of three reputable witnesses, against whose truthfulness not one word is
</p>
<p>uttered here or elsewhere, O'Laughlin went into the house of the Secretary of War,
</p>
<p>where General Grant then was, and placed himself in position in the hall where he
</p>
<p>could see him, having declared before he reached that point, to one of these witnesses,
</p>
<p>that he wished to see General Grant. The house was brilliantly illuminated at the time;
</p>
<p>two, at least, of the witnesses conversed with the accused and the other stood very near
</p>
<p>to him, took special notice of his conduct, called attention to it, and suggested that he
</p>
<p>be put out of the house, and he was accordingly put out by one of the witnesses. These
</p>
<p>witnesses are confident, and have no doubt, and so swear upon their oaths, that Michael
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin is the man who was present on that occasion. There is no denial on the
</p>
<p>part of the accused that he was in Washington during the day and during the night of
</p>
<p>April 13, and also during the day and during the night of the I4th; and yet, to get rid
</p>
<p>of this testimony, recourse is had to that common device an alibi; a device never,
</p>
<p>I may say, more frequently resorted to than in this trial. But what an alibi ! Nobody
</p>
<p>is called to prove it, save some men who, by their own testimony, were engaged in
</p>
<p>a drunken debauch through the evening. A reasonable man who reads their evidence
</p>
<p>can hardly be expected to allow it to outweigh the united testimony of three unimpeached
</p>
<p>and unimpeachable witnesses who were clear in their statements, who entertain no doubt
</p>
<p>of the truth of what they say, whose opportunities to know were full and complete, and
</p>
<p>who were constrained to take special notice of the prisoner by means of his extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary conduct.
</p>
<p>These witnesses describe accurately the appearance, stature, and complexion of the
</p>
<p>accused, but because they describe his clothing as dark or black, it is urged that as part
</p>
<p>of his clothing, although dark, was not black, the witnesses are jnistaken. O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>and his drunken companions (one of whom swears that he drank ten times that even-
</p>
<p>ing) were strolling in the streets and in the direction of the house of the Secretary of
</p>
<p>War, up the Avenue; but you are asked to believe that these witnesses could not be
</p>
<p>mistaken in saying they were not off the Avenue above Seventh Street, or on K Street.
</p>
<p>I venture to say that no man who reads their testimony can determine satisfactorily all
</p>
<p>the places that were visited by O'Laughlin and his drunken associates that evening
</p>
<p>*rom seven to eleven o'clock P.M. All this time, from seven to eleven o'clock P.M.,
</p>
<p>must be accounted for satisfactorily before the alibi can be established. Laughlan does
</p>
<p>not account for all the time, for he left O'Laughlin after seven o'clock, and rejoined

</p>
<p>him, as he says, "I suppose about eight o'clock." Grillet did not meet him until
</p>
<p>half-past ten, and then only casually saw him in passing the hotel. May not Grillet
</p>
<p>have been mistaken as to the fact, although he did meet O'Laughlin after eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock the same evening, as he swears?
</p>
<p>Purdy swears to seeing him in the bar with Grillet about half-past ten, but, as we
</p>
<p>have seen by Grillet's testimony, it must have been after -eleven o'clock. Murphy
</p>
<p>contradicts as to time both Grillet and Purdy, for he says it was half-past eleven or
</p>
<p>twelve o'clock when he and O'Laughlin returned to Rullman's from Platz's, and Early
</p>
<p>swears the accused went from Rullman's to Second Street to a dance about a quarter-
</p>
<p>past eleven o'clock, when O'Laughlin took the lead in the dance and stayed about one
</p>
<p>hour. I follow these witnesses no further. They contradict each other, and do not
</p>
<p>account for O'Laughlin all the time from seven to eleven o'clock. I repeat that no
</p>
<p>man can read their testimony without finding contradictions most material as to time,
</p>
<p>and coming to the conviction that they utterly fail to account for O'Laughlin's where-
</p>
<p>abouts on that evening. To establish an alibi the witnesses must know the fact and
</p>
<p>386
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>testify to it. Laughlan, Grillet, Purdy, Murphy, and Early utterly fail to prove it, and
</p>
<p>only succeed in showing that they did not know where O'Laughlin was all this time,
</p>
<p>and that some of them were grossly mistaken in what they testified, both as to time ami
</p>
<p>place. The testimony of James B. Henderson is equally unsatisfactory. He is contra-
</p>
<p>dicted by other testimony of the accused as to place. He says O'Laughlin went up the
</p>
<p>Avenue above Seventh Street, but that he did not go to Ninth Street. The other wit-
</p>
<p>nesses swear he went to Ninth Street. He swears he went to Canterbury about nine
</p>
<p>o'clock, after going back from Seventh Street to Rullman's. Laughlan swears that
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin was with him at the corner of the Avenue and Ninth Street at nine o'clock,
</p>
<p>and went from there to Canterbury, while Early swears that O'Laughlin went up as far
</p>
<p>as Eleventh Street and returned with him and took supper at Welcker's about eight
</p>
<p>o'clock. If these witnesses prove an alibi, it is really against each other. It is folly
</p>
<p>to pretend that they prove facts which make it impossible that O'Laughlin could have
</p>
<p>been at the house of Secretary Stanton, as three witnesses swear he was, on the evening
</p>
<p>of the 1 3th of April, looking for General Grant.
</p>
<p>Has it not, by the testimony thus reviewed, been established prima facie that in the
</p>
<p>months of February, March, and April, O'Laughlin had combined, confederated, and
</p>
<p>agreed with John Wilkes Booth and Samuel Arnold to kill and murder Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln, William H. Seward, Andrew Johnson, and Ulysses S. Grant? It is not
</p>
<p>established, beyond a shadow of doubt, that Booth had so conspired with the rebel
</p>
<p>agents in Canada as early as October last; that he was in search of agents to do the
</p>
<p>work on pay, in the interests of the rebellion, and that in this speculation Arnold and
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin had joined as early as February; that then, and after, with Booth and
</p>
<p>Surratt, they were in the "oil business," which was the business of assassination by
</p>
<p>contract as a speculation? If this conspiracy on the part of O'Laughlin with Arnold is
</p>
<p>established even prima facie, the declarations and acts of Arnold and Booth, the other
</p>
<p>conspirators, in furtherance of the common design, is evidence against O'Laughlin as
</p>
<p>well as against Arnold himself or the other parties. The rule of law is, that the act or
</p>
<p>declaration of one conspirator, done in pursuance or furtherance of the common
</p>
<p>design, is the act or declaration of all the conspirators. / Wharton, job.
</p>
<p>The letter, therefore, of his co-conspirator, Arnold, is evidence against O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>because it is an act in the prosecution of the common conspiracy, suggesting what
</p>
<p>should be done in order to make it effective, and which suggestion, as has been stated,

</p>
<p>was followed out. The defense has attempted to avoid the force of this letter by
</p>
<p>reciting the statement of Arnold, made to Homer at the time he was arrested, in which
</p>
<p>he declared, among other things, that the purpose was to abduct President Lincoln and
</p>
<p>take him South; that it was to be done at the theatre by throwing the President out of
</p>
<p>the box upon the floor of the stage, when the accused was to catch him. The very
</p>
<p>announcement of this testimony excited derision that such a tragedy meant only to take
</p>
<p>the President and carry him gently away ! This pigmy to catch the giant as the
</p>
<p>assassins hurled him to the floor from an elevation of twelve feet ! The court has
</p>
<p>viewed the theatre, and must be satisfied that Booth, in leaping from the President's
</p>
<p>box, broke his limb. The court cannot fail to conclude that this statement of Arnold
</p>
<p>was but another silly device, like that of the " oil business," which, for the time being,
</p>
<p>he employed to hide from the knowledge of his captor the fact that the purpose was to-
</p>
<p>murder the President. No man can, for a moment, Relieve that any one of these con-
</p>
<p>spirators hoped or desired, by such a proceeding as that stated by this prisoner, to take
</p>
<p>the President alive in the presence of thousands assembled in the theatre after he had
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 387
</p>
<p>been thus thrown upon the floor of the stage, much less to carry him through the city,
</p>
<p>through the lines of your army, and deliver him into the hands of the rebels. No such
</p>
<p>purpose was expressed or hinted by the conspirators in Canada, who commissioned
</p>
<p>Booth to let these assassinations on contract. I shall waste not a moment more in
</p>
<p>combatting such an absurdity.
</p>
<p>Arnold does confess that he was a conspirator with Booth in this purposed murder;
</p>
<p>that Booth had a letter of introduction to Dr. Mudd; that Booth, O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, Surratt, a man with an alias " Mosby," and another whom he does not know,
</p>
<p>and himself, were parties to this conspiracy, and that Booth had furnished them all
</p>
<p>with arms. He concludes this remarkable statement to Horner with the declaration
</p>
<p>that at that time, to wit, the first week of March, or four weeks before he went to
</p>
<p>Fortress Monroe, he left the conspiracy, and that Booth told him to sell his arms if he
</p>
<p>chose. This is sufficiently answered by the fact that, four weeks afterwards, he wrote
</p>
<p>his letter to Booth, which was found in Booth's possession after the assassination, sug-
</p>
<p>gesting to him what to do in order to make the conspiracy a success, and by the further
</p>
<p>fact that at the very moment he uttered these declarations part of his arms were found
</p>
<p>upon his person, and the rest not disposed of, but at his father's house.
</p>
<p>A party to a treasonable and murderous conspiracy against the government of his
</p>
<p>country cannot be held to have abandoned it because he makes such a declaration as
</p>
<p>this, when he is in the hands of the officer of the law, arrested for his crime, and
</p>
<p>especially when his declaration is in conflict with and expressly contradicted by his
</p>
<p>written acts, and unsupported by any conduct of his which becomes a citizen and a
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>If he abondoned the conspiracy, why did he not make known the fact to Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln and his constitutional advisers that these men, armed with the weapons of
</p>
<p>assassination, were daily lying in wait for their lives? To pretend that a man who thus
</p>
<p>conducts himself for weeks after the pretended abandonment, volunteering advice for
</p>
<p>the successful prosecution of the conspiracy, the evidence of which is in writing, and
</p>
<p>about which there can be no mistake, has, in fact, abandoned it, is to insult the com-
</p>
<p>mon understanding of men. O'Laughlin having conspired with Arnold to do this
</p>
<p>murder, is, therefore, as much concluded by the letter of Arnold of the 27th of March
</p>
<p>as is Arnold himself. The further testimony touching O'Laughlin, that of Streett,
</p>
<p>establishes the fact that about the 1st of April he saw him in confidential conversation
</p>
<p>with J. Wilkes Booth, in this city, on the Avenue. Another man, whom the witness

</p>
<p>does not know, was in conversation. O'Laughlin called Streett to one side, and told
</p>
<p>him Booth was busily engaged with his friend was talking privately to his friend.
</p>
<p>This remark of O'Laughlin is attempted to be accounted for, but the attempt failed;
</p>
<p>his counsel taking the pains to ask what induced O'Laughlin to make the remark,
</p>
<p>received the fit reply: "I did not see the interior of Mr. O'Laughlin's mind; I
</p>
<p>cannot tell." It is the province of this court to infer why that remark was made and
</p>
<p>what it signified.
</p>
<p>That John H. Surratt, George A. Atzerodt, Mary E. Surratt, David E. Herold, and
</p>
<p>Louis Payne entered into this conspiracy with Booth, is so very clear upon the testi-
</p>
<p>mony that little time need be occupied in bringing again before the court the evidence
</p>
<p>which establishes it. By the testimony of Wiechmann, we find Atzerodt in February
</p>
<p>at the house of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt. He inquired for her or for John when he
</p>
<p>came and remained over night. After this and before the assassination he visited there
</p>
<p>frequently, and at that house bore the name of " Port Tobacco," the name by which
</p>
<p>388 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>he was known in Canada among the conspirators there. The same witness testifies that
</p>
<p>he met him on the street, when he said he was going to visit Payne at the Herndon
</p>
<p>House, and also accompanied him, along with Herold and John H. Surratt, to the
</p>
<p>theatre in March to hear Booth play in "The Apostate." At the Pennsylvania House,
</p>
<p>one or two weeks previous to the assassination, Atzerodt made the statement to Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Keim, when asking for his knife which he had left in his room, a knife corresponding
</p>
<p>in size with the one exhibited in court, " I want that; if one fails I want the other,"
</p>
<p>wearing at the same time his revolver at his belt. He also stated to Greenawalt, of the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania House, in March, that he was nearly broke, but had friends enough to
</p>
<p>give him as much money as -would see him through, adding, " I am going away some of
</p>
<p>these days, but will return with as much gold as will keep me all my lifetime." Mr.
</p>
<p>Greenawalt also says that Booth had frequent interviews with Atzerodt, sometimes in
</p>
<p>the room, and at other times Booth would walk in and immediately go out, Atzerodt
</p>
<p>following.
</p>
<p>John M. Lloyd testifies that some six weeks before the assassination, Herold,
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, and John H. Surratt came to his house at Surrattsville, bringing with them
</p>
<p>two Spencer carbines with ammunition, also a rope and wrench. Surratt asked the
</p>
<p>witness to take care of them and to conceal the carbines. Surratt took him into a room
</p>
<p>in the house, it being his mother's house, and showed the witness where to put the
</p>
<p>carbines, between the joists on the second floor. The carbines were put there, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to his directions, and concealed. Marcus P. Norton saw Atzerodt in conversation
</p>
<p>with Booth at the National Hotel about the 2d or 3d of March; the conversation was
</p>
<p>confidential, and the witness accidentally heard them talking in regard to President
</p>
<p>Johnson, and say that "the class of witnesses would be of that character that there
</p>
<p>could be little proven by them." This conversation may throw some light on the fact
</p>
<p>that Atzerodt was found in possession of Booth's bank book !
</p>
<p>Colonel Nevens testifies that on the I2th of April last he saw Atzerodt at the Kirk-
</p>
<p>wood House; that Atzerodt there asked him, a stranger, if he knew where Vice-Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Johnson was, and where Mr. Johnson's room was. Colonel Nevens showed him
</p>
<p>where the room of the Vice-President was, and told him that the Vice-President was
</p>
<p>then at dinner. Atzerodt then looked into the dining-room where Vice-President John-
</p>
<p>son was dining alone. Robert R. Jones, the clerk at the Kirkwood House, states that
</p>
<p>on the 1 4th, the day of the murder, two days after this, Atzerodt registered his name
</p>
<p>at the hotel, G. A. Atzerodt, and took No. 126, retaining the room that day, and carry-

</p>
<p>ing away the key. In this room, after the assassination, were found the knife and
</p>
<p>revolver with which he intended to murder the Vice-President.
</p>
<p>The testimony of all these witnesses leaves no doubt that the prisoner, George A.
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, entered into this conspiracy with Booth; that he expected to receive a large
</p>
<p>compensation for the service that he would render in its execution; that he had under-
</p>
<p>taken the assassination of the Vice-President for a price; that he, with Surratt and
</p>
<p>Herold, rendered the important service of depositing the arms and ammunition to be
</p>
<p>used by Booth and his confederates as a protection in their flight after the conspiracy
</p>
<p>had been executed; and that he was careful to have his intended victim pointed out to
</p>
<p>him, and the room he occupied in the hotel, so that when he came to perform his horrid
</p>
<p>work he would know precisely where to go and whom to strike.
</p>
<p>I take no further notice now of the preparation which this prisoner made for the
</p>
<p>successful execution of this part of the traitorous and murderous design. The question
</p>
<p>is, Hid he enter into this conspiracy? His language overheard by Mr. Norton excludes
</p>
<p>A rr END ix. 389
</p>
<p>every other conclusion. Vice- President Johnson's name was mentioned in that secret
</p>
<p>conversation with Booth, and the very suggestive expression was made between them
</p>
<p>that " little could be proved by the witnesses." His confession in his defense is con-
</p>
<p>clusive of his guilt.
</p>
<p>That Payne was in this conspiracy is confessed in the defense made by his counsel,
</p>
<p>and is also evident, from the facts proved, that when the conspiracy was being organized
</p>
<p>in Canada by Thompson, Sanders, Tucker, Cleary, and Clay, this man Payne stood at
</p>
<p>the door of Thompson, was recommended and indorsed by Clay with the words, "We
</p>
<p>trust him"; that after coming hither he first reported himself at the house of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Mary E. Surratt, inquired for her and for John H. Surratt, remained there for four
</p>
<p>days, having conversation with both of them; having provided himself with means of
</p>
<p>disguise, was also supplied with pistols and a knife, such as he afterwards used, and
</p>
<p>spurs, preparatory to his flight; was seen with John H. Surratt, practicing with knives
</p>
<p>such as those employed in this deed of assassination and now before the court; was
</p>
<p>afterwards provided with lodging at the Herndon House, at the instance of Surratt;
</p>
<p>was visited there by Atzerodt, and attended Booth and Surratt to Ford's Theatre, occu-
</p>
<p>pying with those parties the box, as I believe and which we may readily infer, in which
</p>
<p>the President was afterwards murdered.
</p>
<p>If further testimony be wanting that he had entered into the conspiracy, it may be
</p>
<p>found in the fact sworn to by Wiechmann, whose testimnoy no candid man will dis-
</p>
<p>credit, that about the aoth of March, Mrs. Surratt, in great excitement and weeping,
</p>
<p>said that her son John had gone away not to return, when, about three hours subse-
</p>
<p>quently, in the afternoon of the same day, John H. Surratt reappeared, came rushing
</p>
<p>in a state of frenzy into the room, in his mother's house, armed, declaring he would
</p>
<p>shoot whoever came into the room, and proclaiming that his prospects were blasted and
</p>
<p>his hopes gone; that soon Payne came into the same room, also armed and under great
</p>
<p>excitement, and was immediately followed by Booth, with his riding-whip in his hand,
</p>
<p>who walked rapidly across the floor from side to side, so much excited that for some
</p>
<p>time he did not notice the presence of the witness. Observing Wiechmann, the parties
</p>
<p>then withdrew, upon a suggestion from Booth, to an upper room, and there had a pri-
</p>
<p>vate interview. From all that transpired on that occasion, it is apparent that when
</p>
<p>these parties left the house that day it was with the full purpose of completing some
</p>
<p>act essential to the final execution of the work of assassination, in conformity with their
</p>
<p>previous confederation and agreement. They returned foiled from what cause is

<p>unknown dejected, angry, and covered with confusion.
</p>
<p>It is almost imposing upon the patience of the court to consume time in demonstrat-
</p>
<p>ing the fact which none conversant with the testimony of this case can for a moment
</p>
<p>doubt, that John H. Surratt and Mary E. Surratt were as surely in the conspiracy to
</p>
<p>murder the President as was John Wilkes Booth himself. You have the frequent inter-
</p>
<p>views between John H. Surratt and Booth, his intimate relations with Payne, his visits
</p>
<p>from Atzerodt and Herold, his deposit of the arms to cover their flight after the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy should have been executed; his own declared visit to Richmond to do what
</p>
<p>Booth himself said to Chester must be done, to wit, that he or some of the party must
</p>
<p>go to Richmond in order to get funds to carry out the conspiracy; that he brought back
</p>
<p>with him gold, the price of blood, confessing himself that he was there; that he imme-
</p>
<p>diately went to Canada, delivered despatches in cipher to Jacob Thompson from Jeff-
</p>
<p>erson Davis, which were interpreted and read by Thompson in the presence of the witness
</p>
<p>Conover, and in which the conspiracy was approved, and, in the language of Thompson,
</p>
<p>the proposed assassination was "made all right."
</p>
<p>390 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>One other fact, if any other fact be needed, and I have done with the evidence
</p>
<p>which proves that John H. Surratt entered into this combination; that is, that it
</p>
<p>"appears by the testimony of the witness, the cashier of the Ontario Bank, Montreal,
</p>
<p>that Jacob Thompson, about the day that these despatches were delivered, and while
</p>
<p>Surratt was then present in Canada, drew from that bank of the rebel funds there on
</p>
<p>deposit the sum of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars. This being done,
</p>
<p>Surratt, rinding it safer, doubtless, to go to Canada for the great bulk of funds which
</p>
<p>were to be distributed amongst these hired assassins than to attempt to carry it through
</p>
<p>our lines direct from Richmond, immediately returned to Washington and was present
</p>
<p>in this city, as is proven by the testimony of Mr. Reid, on the afternoon of the i4th of
</p>
<p>April, the day of the assassination, booted and spurred, ready for the flight whenever
</p>
<p>the fatal blow should have been struck. If he was not a conspirator and a party to
</p>
<p>this great crime, how comes it that from that hour to this no man has seen him in the
</p>
<p>capital, nor has he been reported anywhere outside of Canada, having arrived at Mont-
</p>
<p>real, as the testimony shows, on the i8th of April, four days after the murder? Noth-
</p>
<p>ing but his conscious coward guilt could possibly induce him to absent himself from
</p>
<p>his mother, as he does, upon her trial. Being one of these conspirators, as charged,
</p>
<p>every act of his in the prosecution of this crime is evidence against the other parties to
</p>
<p>the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>That Mary E. Surratt is as guilty as her son of having thus conspired, combined, and
</p>
<p>confederated to do this murder, in aid of this rebellion, is clear. First, her house was
</p>
<p>the headquarters of Booth, John H. Surratt, Atzerodt, Payne, and Herold. She is
</p>
<p>inquired for by Atzerodt; she is inquired for by Payne; and she is visited by Booth,
</p>
<p>and holds private conversations with him. His picture, together with that of the chief
</p>
<p>conspirator, Jefferson Davis, is found in her house. She sends to Booth for a carriage
</p>
<p>to take her, on the nth of April, to Surrattsville for the purpose of perfecting the
</p>
<p>arrangement deemed necessary to the successful execution of the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>especially to facilitate and protect the conspirators in their escape from justice. On
</p>
<p>that occasion Booth, having disposed of his carriage, gives to the agent she employed
</p>
<p>ten dollars with which to hire a conveyance for that purpose. And yet the pretence
</p>
<p>is made that Mrs. Surratt went on the nth to Surrattsville exclusively upon her own
</p>
<p>private and lawful business. Can any one tell, if that be so, how it comes that she
</p>
<p>should apply to Booth for a conveyance, and how it comes that he of his own accord,
</p>
<p>having no conveyance to furnish her, should send her ten dollars with which to procure

</p>
<p>it? There is not the slightest indication that Booth was under any obligation to her,
</p>
<p>or that she had any claim upon him, either for a conveyance or for the means with
</p>
<p>which to procure one, except that he was bound to contribute, being the agent of the
</p>
<p>conspirators in Canada and Richmond, whatever money might be necessary to the con-
</p>
<p>summation of this infernal plot. On that day, the nth of April, John H. Surratt had
</p>
<p>not returned from Canada with the funds furnished by Thompson !
</p>
<p>Upon that journey of the nth the accused, Mary E. Surratt, met the witness
</p>
<p>John M. Lloyd at Uniontown. She called him; lie got out of his carriage and came
</p>
<p>to her, and she whispered to him in so low a tone that her attendant could not hear
</p>
<p>her words, though Lloyd, to whom they were spoken, did distinctly hear them, and
</p>
<p>testifies that she told him he should have those "shooting-irons " ready, meaning the
</p>
<p>carbines which her son and Herold and Atzerodt had deposited with him, and
</p>
<p>added the reason, " for they would soon be called for." On the day of the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion she again sent for Booth, had an interview with him in her own house, and
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 391
</p>
<p>immediately went again to Surrattsville, and then, at about six o'clock in the afternoon,
</p>
<p>she delivered to Lloyd a field-glass, and told him " to have two bottles of whiskey and the
</p>
<p>carbines ready, as they would be called for that night." Having thus perfected the
</p>
<p>arrangement she returned to Washington to her own house, at about half-past eight
</p>
<p>o'clock in the evening, to await the final result. How could this woman anticipate on
</p>
<p>Friday afternoon, at six o'clock, that these arms would be called for and would be
</p>
<p>needed that night unless she was in the conspiracy and knew the blow was to be struck,
</p>
<p>and the flight of the assassins attempted and by that route? Was not the private con-
</p>
<p>versation which Booth held with her in her parlor on the afternoon of the I4th of
</p>
<p>April, just before she left on this business, in relation to the orders she should give to
</p>
<p>have the arms ready?
</p>
<p>An endeavor is made to impeach Lloyd. But the court will observe that no witness
</p>
<p>has been called who contradicts Lloyd's statement in any material matter; neither has
</p>
<p>his general character for truth been assailed. How, then, is he impeached? Is it
</p>
<p>claimed that his testimony shows that he was a party to the conspiracy? Then it is
</p>
<p>conceded by those who set up any such pretence that there was a conspiracy. A con-
</p>
<p>spiracy between whom? There can be no conspiracy without the co-operation or
</p>
<p>agreement of two or more persons. Who were the other parties to it? Was it
</p>
<p>Mary E. Surratt? Was it John H. Surratt, George A. Atzerodt, David E. Herold?
</p>
<p>Those are the only persons, so far as his own testimony or the testimony of any other
</p>
<p>witness discloses, with whom he had any communication whatever on any subject
</p>
<p>immediately or remotely touching this conspiracy before the assassination. His receipt
</p>
<p>and concealment of the arms are, unexplained, evidence that he was in the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The explanation is that he was dependent upon Mary E. Surratt; was her tenant;
</p>
<p>and his declaration, given in evidence by the accused herself, is that " she had ruined
</p>
<p>him and brought this trouble upon him." But because he was weak enough, or wicked
</p>
<p>enough, to become the guilty depository of these arms, and to deliver them on the
</p>
<p>order of Mary E. Surratt to the assassins, it does not follow that he is not to be believed
</p>
<p>on oath. It is said that he concealed the facts that the arms had been left and called
</p>
<p>for. He so testifies himself, but he gives the reason that he did it only from apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion of danger to his life. If he were in the conspiracy, his general credit being
</p>
<p>unchallenged, his testimony being uncontradicted in any material matter, he is to be
</p>
<p>believed, and cannot be disbelieved if his testimony is substantially corroborated by
</p>
<p>other reliable witnesses. Is he not corroborated touching the deposit of arms by the

</p>
<p>fact that the arms are produced in court, one of which was found upon the person of
</p>
<p>Booth at the time he was overtaken and slain, and which is identified as the same which
</p>
<p>had been left with Lloyd by Herold, Surratt, and Atzerodt? Is he not corroborated in
</p>
<p>the fact of the first interview with Mrs. Surratt by the joint testimony of Mrs. Offut
</p>
<p>and Lewis J. Wiechmann, each of whom testified (and they are contradicted by no
</p>
<p>one), that on Tuesday, the nth day of April, at Uniontown, Mrs. Surratt called Mr.
</p>
<p>Lloyd to come to her, which he did, and she held a secret conversation with him? Is
</p>
<p>he not corroborated as to the last conversation on the I4th of April by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Offut, who swears that upon the evening of the I4th of April she saw the pris-
</p>
<p>oner, Mary E. Surratt, at Lloyd's house, approach and hold conversation with him?
</p>
<p>Is he not corroborated in the fact, to which he swears, that Mrs. Surratt delivered to
</p>
<p>him at that time the field-glass wrapped in paper, by the sworn statement of Wiechmann
</p>
<p>that Mrs. Surratt took with her on that occasion two packages, both of which were
</p>
<p>wrapped in paper, and one of which he describes as a small package about six inches
</p>
<p>392 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>in diameter? The attempt was made by calling Mrs. Offut to prove that no such pack-
</p>
<p>age was delivered, but it failed; she merely states that Mrs. Surratt delivered a package
</p>
<p>wrapped in paper to her after her arrival there, and before Lloyd came in, which was
</p>
<p>laid down in the room. But whether it was the package about which Lloyd testifies, or
</p>
<p>the other package of the two about which Wiechmann testifies, as having been carried
</p>
<p>there that day by Mrs. Surratt, does not appear. Neither does this witness pretend to
</p>
<p>say that Mrs. Surratt, after she had delivered it to her, and the witness had laid it down
</p>
<p>in the room, did not again take it up, if it were the same, and put it in the hands of
</p>
<p>Lloyd. She only knows that she did not see that done; but she did see Lloyd with a
</p>
<p>package like the one she received in the room before Mrs. Surratt left. How it came
</p>
<p>into his possession she is not able to state; nor what the package was that Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>first handed her; nor which of the packages it was she afterwards saw in the hands of
</p>
<p>Lloyd.
</p>
<p>But there is one other fact in this case that puts forever at rest the question of the
</p>
<p>guilty participation of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt, in this conspiracy and murder; and
</p>
<p>that is that Payne, who had lodged four days in hei. house who during all that time
</p>
<p>had sat at her table, and who had often conversed with her when the guilt of his
</p>
<p>great crime was upon him, and he knew not where else he could so safely go to find a
</p>
<p>co-conspirator, and he could trust none that was not like himself, guilty, with even the
</p>
<p>knowledge of his presence under cover of darkness, after wandering for three days

</p>
<p>found his way to the door of Mrs. Surratt, rang the bell, was admitted, and upon being
</p>
<p>asked, " Whom do you want to see? " replied, " Mrs. Surratt." He was then asked
</p>
<p>by the officer, Morgan, what he came at that time of night for, to which he replied,
</p>
<p>" to dig a gutter in the morning; Mrs. Surratt had sent for him." Afterwards he said
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Surratt knew he was a poor man and came to him." Being asked where he last
</p>
<p>worked, he replied, "sometimes on ' I ' street"; and where he boarded, he replied,
</p>
<p>"he had no boarding-house, and was a poor man who got his living with the pick,"
</p>
<p>which he bore upon his shoulder, having stolen it from the intrenchments of the capital.
</p>
<p>Upon being pressed again why he came there at that time of night to go to work, he

<p>answered that he simply called to see what time he should go to work in the morning.

<p>Upon being told by the officer, who fortunately had preceded him to this house, that
</p>
<p>he would have to go to the provost marshal's office, he moved and did not answer,

<p>this man. Raising her right hand, she exclaimed, " Before God, sir, I have not seen
</p>
<p>that man before; I have not hired him; I do not know anything about him." The
</p>
<p>hall was brilliantly lighted.
</p>
<p>If not one word had been said, the mere act of Payne in flying to her house for
</p>
<p>shelter would have borne witness against her, strong as proofs from Holy Writ. But
</p>
<p>when she denies, after hearing his declarations, that she had sent for him, or that she
</p>
<p>had gone to him and hired him, and calls her God to witness that she had never seen
</p>
<p>him, and knew nothing of him, when, in point of fact, she had seen him for four suc-
</p>
<p>cessive days in her own house, in the same clothing which he then wore, who can
</p>
<p>resist for a moment the conclusion that these parties were alike guilty?
</p>
<p>The testimony of Spangler's complicity is conclusive and brief. It was impossible
</p>
<p>to hope for escape after assassinating the President, and such others as might attend
</p>
<p>him in Ford's Theatre, without arrangements being first made to aid the flight of the
</p>
<p>assassin and to some extent prevent immediate pursuit.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 393
</p>
<p>A stable was to be provided close to Ford's Theatre, in which the horses could be
</p>
<p>concealed and kept ready for the assassin's use whenever the murderous, blow was
</p>
<p>struck. Accordingly, Booth secretly, through Maddox, hired a stable in rear of the
</p>
<p>theatre and connecting with it by an alley, as early as the 1st of January last; showing
</p>
<p>that at that time he had concluded, notwithstanding all that has been said to the con-
</p>
<p>trary, to murder the President in Ford's Theatre and provide the means for immediate
</p>
<p>and successful flight. Conscious of his guilt, he paid the rent for this stable through
</p>
<p>Maddox, month by month, giving him the money. He employed Spangler, doubtless
</p>
<p>for the reason that he could trust him with the secret, as a carpenter to fit up this shed,
</p>
<p>so that it would furnish room for two horses, and provide the door with lock and key.
</p>
<p>Spangler did this work for him. Then, it was necessary that a carpenter having access
</p>
<p>to the theatre should be employed by the assassin to provide a bar for the outer door of
</p>
<p>the passage leading to the President's box, so that when he entered upon his work of
</p>
<p>assassination he would be secure from interruption from the rear. By the evidence, it
</p>
<p>is shown that Spangler was in the box in which the President was murdered on the
</p>
<p>afternoon of the I4th of April, and when there damned the President and General
</p>
<p>Grant, and said the President ought to be cursed, he had got so many good men killed;
</p>
<p>showing not only his hostility to the President, but the cause of it that he had been
</p>
<p>faithful to his oath and had resisted that great rebellion in the interest of which his life
</p>
<p>was about to be sacrificed by this man and his co-conspirators. In performing the
</p>
<p>work which had doubtless been intrusted to him by Booth, a mortise was cut in the
</p>
<p>wall. A wooden bar was prepared, one end of which could be readily inserted in
</p>
<p>the mortise and the other pressed against the edge of the door on the -inside so as to
</p>
<p>prevent its being opened. Spangler had the skill and the opportunity to do that work
</p>
<p>and all the additional work which was done.
</p>
<p>It is in evidence that the screws in " the keepers " to the locks on each of the inner
</p>
<p>doors of the box occupied by the President were drawn. The attempt has been made,
</p>
<p>on behalf of the prisoner, to show that this was done some time before, accidentally,
</p>
<p>and with no bad design, and had not been repaired by reason of inadvertence; but
</p>
<p>that attempt has utterly failed, because the testimony adduced for that purpose relates
</p>
<p>exclusively to but one of the two inner doors, while the fact is, that the screws were
</p>
<p>drawn in both, and the additional precaution taken to cut a small hole through one of
</p>
<p>these doors through which the party approaching and while in the private passage
</p>
<p>would be enabled to look into the box and examine the exact posture of the President

<p>before entering. It was also deemed essential, in the execution of this plot, that some
</p>
<p>one should watch at the outer door, in the rear of the theatre, by which alone the
</p>
<p>assassin could hope for escape. It was for this work Booth sought to employ Chester
</p>
<p>in January, offering three thousand dollars down of the money of his employers, and
</p>
<p>the assurance that he should never want. What Chester refused to do Spangler under-
</p>
<p>took and promised to do. When Booth brought his horse to the rear door of the
</p>
<p>theatre, on the evening of the murder, he called for Spangler, who went to him, when
</p>
<p>Booth was heard to say to him, "Ned, you'll help me all you can, won't you?" To
</p>
<p>which Splangler replied, " Oh, yes."
</p>
<p>When Booth made his escape, it is testified by Colonel Stewart, who pursued him
</p>
<p>across the stage and out through the same door, that as he approached it some one
</p>
<p>slammed it shut. Ritterspaugh, who was standing behind the scenes when Booth fired
</p>
<p>the pistol and fled, saw Booth run down the passage toward the back door, and pur-
</p>
<p>sued him; but Booth drew his knife upon him and passed out, slamming the door after
</p>
<p>394 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>him. Ritterspaugh opened it and went through, leaving it open behind him, leaving
</p>
<p>Spangler inside, and in a position from which he readily could have reached the door.
</p>
<p>Ritterspaugh also states that very quickly after he had passed through this door he was
</p>
<p>followed by a large man, the first who followed him, and who was, doubtless, Colonel
</p>
<p>Stewart. Stewart is very positive that he saw this door slammed; that he himself was
</p>
<p>constrained to open it, and had some difficulty in opening it. He also testifies that as
</p>
<p>he approached the door a man stood near enough to have thrown it to with his hand,
</p>
<p>and this man, the witness believes, was the prisoner Spangler. Ritterspaugh has
</p>
<p>sworn that he left the door open behind him when he went out, and that he was first
</p>
<p>followed by the large man, Colonel Stewart. Who slammed that door behind Ritters-
</p>
<p>paugh? It was not Ritterspaugh; it could not have been Booth, for Ritterspaugh
</p>
<p>swears that Booth was mounting his horse at the time; and Stewart swears that Booth
</p>
<p>was upon his horse when he came out. That it was Spangler who slammed the door
</p>
<p>after Ritterspaugh may not only be inferred from Stewart's testimony, but it is made
</p>
<p>very clear by his own conduct afterwards upon the return of Ritterspaugh to the stage.
</p>
<p>The door being then open, and Ritterspaugh being asked which way Booth went, had
</p>
<p>answered. Ritterspaugh says: "Then I came back on the stage, where I had left
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler; he hit me on the face with his hand and said, ' Don't say which
</p>
<p>way he went.' I asked him what he meant by slapping me in the mouth? He said,
</p>
<p>'For God's sake, shut up.' "
</p>
<p>The testimony of Withers is adroitly handled to throw doubt upon these facts. It
</p>
<p>cannot avail, for Withers says he was knocked in the scene by Booth, and when he
</p>
<p>"come to" he got a side view of him. A man knocked down and senseless, on
</p>
<p>" coming to " might mistake anybody by a side view for Booth.
</p>
<p>An attempt has been made by the defense to discredit this testimony of Ritters-
</p>
<p>paugh, by showing his contradictory statements to Gifford, Garlan, and Lamb, neither
</p>
<p>of whom do in fact contradict him, but substantially sustain him. None but a guilty
</p>
<p>man would have met the witness with a blow for stating which way the assassin had
</p>
<p>gone. A like confession of guilt was made by Spangler when the witness Miles, the
</p>
<p>same evening, and directly after the assassination, came to the back door, where
</p>
<p>Spangler was standing with others, and asked Spangler who it was that held the horse,
</p>
<p>to which Spangler replied : "Hush; don't say anything about it." He confessed his
</p>
<p>guilt again when he denied to Mary Anderson the fact, proved here beyond all
</p>
<p>question, that Booth had called him when he came to that door with his horse, using

</p>
<p>the emphatic words, " No, he did not; he did not call me." The rope comes to bear
</p>
<p>witness against him, as did the rope which Atzerodt and Herold and John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>had carried to Surrattsville and deposed there with the carbines.
</p>
<p>It is only surprising that the ingenious counsel did not attempt to explain the
</p>
<p>deposit of the rope at Surrattsville by the same method that he adopted in explanation
</p>
<p>of the deposit of this rope, some sixty feet long, found in the carpet-sack of Spangler,
</p>
<p>unaccounted for save by some evidence which tends to show that he may have carried
</p>
<p>it away from the theatre.
</p>
<p>It is not needful to take time in the recapitulation of the evidence, which shows
</p>
<p>conclusively that David E. Herold was one of these conspirators. His continued asso-
</p>
<p>ciation with Booth, with Atzerodt, his visits to Mrs. Surratt's, his attendance at the
</p>
<p>theatre with Payne, Surratt, and Atzerodt, his connection with Atzerodt on the evening
</p>
<p>of the murder, riding with him on the street in the direction of and near to the theatre
</p>
<p>at the hour appointed for the work of assassination, and his final flight and arrest,

</p>
<p>show that he, in common with all the other parties on trial, and all the parties named
</p>
<p>upon your record not upon trial, and combined and confederated to kill and murder in
</p>
<p>the interests of the rebellion, as charged and specified against them.
</p>
<p>That this conspiracy was entered into by all these parties, both present and absent,
</p>
<p>is thus proved by the acts, meetings, declarations, and correspondence of all the
</p>
<p>parties, beyond any doubt whatever. True it is circumstantial evidence, but the court
</p>
<p>will remember the rule before recited, that circumstances cannot lie; that they are
</p>
<p>held sufficient in every court where justice is judicially administered to establish the
</p>
<p>fact of a conspiracy. I shall take no further notice of the remark made by the learned
</p>
<p>counsel who opens for the defense, and which has been followed by several of his
</p>
<p>associates, that under the Constitution it requires two witnesses to prove the overt act
</p>
<p>of high treason, than to say, this is not a charge of high treason, but of a treasonable
</p>
<p>conspiracy, in aid of a rebellion, with intent to kill and murder the executive officer of
</p>
<p>the United States, and commander of its armies, and of the murder of the President in
</p>
<p>pursuance of that conspiracy, and with the intent laid, etc. Neither by the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, nor by the rules of the common law, is any fact connected with this allegation
</p>
<p>required to be established by the testimony of more than one witness. I might say,
</p>
<p>however, that every substantive averment against each of the parties named upon this
</p>
<p>record has been established by the testimony of more than one witness.
</p>
<p>That the several accused did enter into this conspiracy with John Wilkes Booth and
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt to murder the officers of this government named upon the record, in
</p>
<p>pursuance of the wishes of their employers and instigators in Richmond and Canada,
</p>
<p>and with intent thereby to aid the existing rebellion and subvert the Constitution and
</p>
<p>laws of the United States, as alleged, is no longer an open question.
</p>
<p>The intent as laid was expressly declared by Sanders in the meeting of the conspir-
</p>
<p>ators at Montreal in February last, by Booth in Virginia and New York, and by Thomp-
</p>
<p>son to Conover and Montgomery; but if there were no testimony directly upon this
</p>
<p>point, the law would presume the intent, for the reason that such was the natural and
</p>
<p>necessary tendency and manifest design of the act itself.
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman (Mr. Johnson) says the government has survived the assas-
</p>
<p>sination of the President, and thereby would have you infer that this conspiracy was
</p>
<p>not entered into and attempted to be executed with the intent laid. With as much
</p>
<p>show of reason it might be said that because the government of the United States has
</p>
<p>survived this unmatched rebellion, it therefore results that the rebel conspirators

<p>waged war upon the government with no purpose or intent thereby to subvert it. By
</p>
<p>the law we have seen that, without any direct evidence of previous combination and
</p>
<p>agreement between these parties, the conspiracy might be established by evidence of the
</p>
<p>acts of the prisoners, or of any others with whom they co-operated, concurring in the
</p>
<p>execution of the common design. Roscoe, 416.
</p>
<p>Was there co-operation between the several accused in the execution of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy? That there was is as clearly established by the testimony as is the fact that
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was killed and murdered by John Wilkes Booth. The evidence shows
</p>
<p>that all of the accused, save Mudd and Arnold, were in Washington on the I4th of
</p>
<p>April, the day of .the assassination, together with John Wilkes Booth and John H.
</p>
<p>Surratt; that on that day Booth had a secret interview with the prisoner, Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt; that immediately thereafter she went to Surrattsville to perform her part of the
</p>
<p>preparation necessary to the successful execution of the conspiracy, and did make that
</p>
<p>preparation; that John H. Surratt had arrived here from Canada, notifying the parties
</p>
<p>39<5 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>that the price to be paid for this great crime had been provided for, at least in part, by
</p>
<p>the deposit receipts of April 6th for $180,000, procured by Thompson of the Ontario
</p>
<p>Bank, Montreal, Canada; that he was also prepared to keep watch, or strike a blow,
</p>
<p>and ready for the contemplated flight; that Atzerodt, on the afternoon of that day,
</p>
<p>was seeking to obtain a horse, the better to secure his own safety by flight, after he
</p>
<p>should have performed the task which he had voluntarily undertaken by contract in the
</p>
<p>Conspiracy the murder of Andrew Johnson, then Vice-President of the United States;
</p>
<p>that he did procure a horse for that purpose at Naylor's, and was seen about nine o'clock
</p>
<p>in the evening to ride to the Kirkwood House, where the Vice-President then was, dis-
</p>
<p>mount and enter. At a previous hour Booth was in the Kirkwood House, and left his
</p>
<p>card, now in evidence, doubtless intended to be sent to the room of the Vice-President,
</p>
<p>and which was in these words: "Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth." Atzerodt, when he made application at Brooks's in the afternoon for
</p>
<p>the horse, said to Wiechmann, who was there, he was going to ride in the country, and
</p>
<p>that " he was going to get a horse and send for Payne." He did get a horse for Payne,
</p>
<p>as well as for himself; for it is proven that on the I2th he was seen in Washington
</p>
<p>riding the horse which had been procured by Booth, in company with Mudd, last
</p>
<p>November, from Gardner. A similar horse was tied before the door of Mr. Seward on
</p>
<p>the night of the murder, was captured after the flight of Payne, who was seen to ride
</p>
<p>away, and which horse is now identified as the Gardner horse. Booth also procured a
</p>
<p>horse on the same day, took it to his stable in the rear of the theatre, where he had an
</p>
<p>interview with Spangler, and where he concealed it. Herold, too, obtained a horse in
</p>
<p>the afternoon, and was seen between nine and ten o'clock riding with Atzerodt down
</p>
<p>the Avenue from the Treasury, then up Fourteenth and down F Street, passing close
</p>
<p>by Ford's Theatre.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin had come to Washington the day before, had sought out his victim
</p>
<p>(General Grant) at the house of the Secretary of War, that he might be able with
</p>
<p>certainty to identify him, and at the very hour when these preparations were going on
</p>
<p>was lying in wait at Rullman's on the Avenue, keeping watch, and declaring, as he
</p>
<p>did, at about ten o'clock P.M., when told that the fatal blow had been struck by Booth,
</p>
<p>"I don't believe Booth did it." During the day, and the night before, he had been
</p>
<p>visiting Booth, and doubtless encouraging him, and at that very hour was in position,
</p>
<p>at a convenient distance, to aid and protect him in his flight, as well as to execute his
</p>
<p>own part of the conspiracy by inflicting death upon General Grant, who, happily, was.

<p>not at the theatre nor in the city, having left the city that day. Who doubts that
</p>
<p>Booth, having ascertained in the course of the day that General Grant would not be
</p>
<p>present at the theatre, O'Laughlin, who was to murder General Grant, instead of enter-
</p>
<p>ing the box with Booth, was detailed to lie in wait, and watch and support him.
</p>
<p>His declarations of his reasons for changing his lodgings here and in Baltimore,
</p>
<p>after the murder, so ably and so ingeniously presented in the argument of his learned
</p>
<p>counsel (Mr. Cox), avail nothing before the blasting fact that he did change his lodg-
</p>
<p>ings, and declared "he knew nothing of the affair whatever." O'Laughlin, who
</p>
<p>lurked here, conspiring daily with Booth and Arnold for six weeks to do this murder,
</p>
<p>declares "he knew nothing of the affair." O'Laughlin, who said ^he was "in the oil
</p>
<p>business," which Booth and Surratt and Payne and Arnold have all declared meant this
</p>
<p>conspiracy, says he "knew nothing of the affair." O'Laughlin, to whom Booth sent
</p>
<p>the despatches of the I3th and 27th of March O'Laughlin, who is named in Arnold's
</p>
<p>letter as one of the conspirators, and who searched for General Grant on Thursday

</p>
<p>night, laid in wait for him on Friday, was defeated by that Providence " which shapes
</p>
<p>our ends," and laid in wait to aid Booth and Payne, declares "he knows nothing of
</p>
<p>the matter." Such a denial is as false and inexcusable as Peter's denial of our Lord.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt had arrived at home, from the completion of her part in the plot, about
</p>
<p>half past eight o'clock in the evening. A few moments afterwards she was called to
</p>
<p>the parlor and there had a private interview with some one unseen, but whose retreating
</p>
<p>footsteps were heard by the witness Wiechmann. This was doubtless the secret and
</p>
<p>last visit of John H. Surratt to his mother, who had instigated and encouraged him to
</p>
<p>strike this traitorous and murderous blow against his country.
</p>
<p>While all these preparations were going on, Mudd was awaiting the execution of the
</p>
<p>plot, ready to faithfully perform his part in securing the safe escape of the murderers.
</p>
<p>Arnold was at his post at Fortress Monroe, awaiting the meeting referred to in his letter
</p>
<p>of March 27th, wherein he says they were not "to meet for a month or so," which
</p>
<p>month had more than expired on the day of the murder, for his letter and the testimony
</p>
<p>disclose that this month of suspension began to run from about the first week in March.
</p>
<p>He stood ready with the arms which Booth had furnished him to aid the escape of the
</p>
<p>murderers by that route, and secure their communication with their employers. He
</p>
<p>had given the assurance in that letter to Booth, that although the government "suspi-
</p>
<p>cioned them," and the undertaking was "becoming complicated," yet "a time more
</p>
<p>propitious would arrive" for the consummation of this conspiracy in which he "was
</p>
<p>one " with Booth, and when he would " be better prepared to again be with him."
</p>
<p>Such were the preparations. The horses were in readiness for the flight; the
</p>
<p>ropes were procured, doubtless for the purpose of tying the horses at whatever point they
</p>
<p>might be constrained to delay and to secure their boats to their moorings in making
</p>
<p>their way across the Potomac. The five murderous camp knives, the twp carbines, the
</p>
<p>eight revolvers, the derringer, in court and identified, all were ready for the work of
</p>
<p>death. The part that each had played has already been in part stated in this argument,
</p>
<p>and needs no repetition.
</p>
<p>Booth proceeded to the theatre about nine o'clock in the evening, at the same time
</p>
<p>that Atzerodt and Payne and Herold were riding the streets, while Surratt, having
</p>
<p>parted with his mother at the brief interview in her parlor, from which his retreating
</p>
<p>steps were heard, was walking the Avenue, booted and spurred, and doubtless con-
</p>
<p>sulting with O'Laughlin. When Booth reached the rear of the theatre, he called Spang-
</p>
<p>ler to him (whose denial of that fact, when charged with it, as proven by three witnesses

</p>
<p>is very significant) and received from Spangler his pledge to help him all he could,
</p>
<p>when with Booth he entered the theatre by the stage-door, doubtless to see that the
</p>
<p>way was clear from the box to the rear door of the theatre, and look upon their victim,
</p>
<p>whose exact position they could study from the stage. After this view, Booth passes to
</p>
<p>the street in front of the theatre, where, on the pavement with other conspirators yet
</p>
<p>unknown, among them one described as a low-browed villain, he awaits the appointed
</p>
<p>moment. Booth himself, impatient, enters the vestibule of the theatre from the front
</p>
<p>and asks the time. He is referred to the clock, and returns. Presently, as the hour of
</p>
<p>ten o'clock approached, one of his guilty associates called the time; they wait; again,
</p>
<p>as the moments elapsed, this conspirator upon watch called the time; again, as the
</p>
<p>appointed hour draws nigh, he calls the time; and finally, when the fatal moment
</p>
<p>arrives, he repeats in a louder tone, "Ten minutes past ten o'clock!" Ten minutes
</p>
<p>past ten o'clock ! The hour has come when the red right hand of these murderous
</p>
<p>conspirators should strike, and the dreadful deed of assassination be done.
</p>
<p>398 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>Booth, at the appointed moment, entered the theatre, ascended to the dress-circle,,
</p>
<p>passed to the right, paused a moment, looking down, doubtless to see if Spangler was
</p>
<p>at his post, and approached the outer door of the close passage leading to the box
</p>
<p>occupied by the President, pressed it open, passed in, and closed the passage door
</p>
<p>behind him. Spangler's bar was in its place, and was readily adjusted by Booth in the
</p>
<p>mortise, and pressed against the inner side of the door, so that he was secure from
</p>
<p>interruption from without. He passes on to the next door, immediately behind the
</p>
<p>President, and there stopping, looks through the aperture in the door into the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's box, and deliberately observes the precise position of his victim, seated in the
</p>
<p>chair which had been prepared by the conspirators as the altar for the sacrifice, looking
</p>
<p>calmly and quietly down upon the glad and grateful people whom by his fidelity he had
</p>
<p>saved from the peril which had threatened the destruction of their government, and all
</p>
<p>they held dear this side of the grave, and whom he had come upon invitation to greet
</p>
<p>with his presence, with the words still lingering upon his lips which he had uttered with
</p>
<p>uncovered head and uplifted hand before God and his country, when on the 4th of last
</p>
<p>March he took again the oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, declar-
</p>
<p>ing that he entered upon the duties of his great office ' ' with malice toward none
</p>
<p>with charity for all." In a moment more, strengthened by the knowledge that his
</p>
<p>co-conspirators were all at their posts, seven at least of them present in the city, two
</p>
<p>of them, Mudd and Arnold, at their appointed places, watching for his coming, this
</p>
<p>hired assassin moves stealthily through the door, the fastenings of which had been
</p>
<p>removed to facilitate his entrance, fires upon his victim, and the martyr spirit of Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln ascends to God.
</p>
<p>"Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
</p>
<p>Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
</p>
<p>Can touch him further."
</p>
<p>At the same hour, when these accused and their co-conspirators in Richmond and
</p>
<p>Canada, by the hand of John Wilkes Booth, inflicted this mortal wound which deprived
</p>
<p>the republic of its defender, and filled this land from ocean to ocean with a strange,
</p>
<p>great sorrow, Payne, a very demon in human form, with the words of falsehood upon
</p>
<p>his lips, that he was the bearer of a message from the physician of the venerable Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of State, sweeps by his servant, encounters his son, who protests that the assassin
</p>
<p>shall not disturb his father, prostrate on a bed of sickness, and receives for answer the
</p>
<p>assassin's blow from the revolver in his hand, repeated again and again, rushes into the

<p>room, is encountered by Major Seward, inflicts wound after wound upon him with his
</p>
<p>murderous knife, is encountered by Hansell and Robinson, each of whom he also
</p>
<p>wounds, springs upon the defenseless and feeble Secretary of State, stabs first on one
</p>
<p>side of his throat, then on the other, again in the face, and is only prevented from
</p>
<p>literally hacking out his life by the persistence and courage of the attendant Robinson.
</p>
<p>He turns to flee, and, his giant arm and murderous hand for a moment paralyzed by
</p>
<p>the consciousness of guilt, he drops his weapons of death, one in the house, the other
</p>
<p>at the door, where they were taken up, and are here now to bear witness against him.
</p>
<p>He attempts escape on the horse which Booth and Mudd had procured of Gardner,

<p>with what success has already been stated.

<p>Atzerodt, near midnight, returns to the stable of Naylor the horse which he had
</p>
<p>procured for this work of murder, having been interrupted in the execution of the part

<p>assigned him at the Kirkwood House by the timely coming of citizens to the defense of
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 399
</p>
<p>the Vice-President, and creeps into the Pennsylvania House at two o'clock in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing with another of the conspirators, yet unknown. There he remained until about five
</p>
<p>o'clock, when he left, found his way to Georgetown, pawned one of his revolvers, now
</p>
<p>in court, and fled northward into Maryland.
</p>
<p>He is traced to Montgomery County, to the house of Mr. Metz, on the Sunday
</p>
<p>succeeding the murder, where, as is proved by the testimony of three witnesses, he said
</p>
<p>that if the man that was to follow General Grant had followed him, it was likely that
</p>
<p>Grant was shot. To one of these witnesses (Mr. Layman) he said he did not think
</p>
<p>Grant had been killed ; or if he had been killed he was killed by a man who got on the
</p>
<p>cars at the same time that Grant did; thus disclosing most clearly that one of his co-
</p>
<p>conspirators was assigned the task of killing and murdering General Grant, and that
</p>
<p>Atzerodt knew that General Grant had left the city of Washington, a fact which is not
</p>
<p>disputed, on the Friday evening of the murder, by the evening train. Thus this intended
</p>
<p>victim of the conspiracy escaped, for that night, the knives and revolvers of Atzerodt
</p>
<p>and O'Laughlin and Payne and Herold and Booth and John H. Surratt and, perchance,
</p>
<p>Harper and Caldwell, and twenty others, who were then here lying in wait for his life.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Booth and Herold, taking the route before agreed upon, make
</p>
<p>directly after the assassination for the Anacostia bridge. Booth crosses first, gives his
</p>
<p>name, passes the guard, and is speedily followed by Herold. They make their way
</p>
<p>directly to Surrattsville, where Herold calls to Lloyd, "Bring out those things," show-
</p>
<p>ing that there had been communication between them and Mrs. Surratt after her return.
</p>
<p>Both the carbines being in readiness, according to Mary E. Surratt's directions, both
</p>
<p>were brought out. They took but one. Booth declined to carry the other, saying that
</p>
<p>his limb was broken. They then declared that they had murdered the President and
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State. They then make their way directly to the house of the prisoner
</p>
<p>Mudd, assured of safety and security. They arrived early in the morning before day,
</p>
<p>and no man knows at what hour they left. Herold rode towards Bryantown with Mudd
</p>
<p>about three o'clock that afternoon, in the vicinity of which place he parted with him,
</p>
<p>remaining in the swamp, and was afterwards seen returning the same afternoon in the
</p>
<p>direction of Mudd's house, about which time, a little before sundown, Mudd returned
</p>
<p>from Bryantown towards his home. This village at the time Mudd was in it was
</p>
<p>thronged with soldiers in pursuit of the murderers of the President, and although great
</p>
<p>care has been taken by the defense to deny that any one said in the presence of Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd, either .there or elsewhere on that day, who had committed this crime, yet it is in

</p>
<p>evidence by two witnesses, whose truthfulness no man questions, that upon Mudd's
</p>
<p>return to his own house that afternoon, he stated that Booth was the murderer of the
</p>
<p>President, and Boyle the murderer of Secretary Seward, but took care to make the
</p>
<p>further remark that Booth had brothers, and he did not know which of them had done
</p>
<p>the act. When did Dr. Mudd learn that Booth had brothers? And what is still more
</p>
<p>pertinent to this inquiry, from whom did he learn that either John Wilkes Booth or any
</p>
<p>of his brothers had murdered the President? It is clear that Booth remained in his
</p>
<p>house until some time in the afternoon of Saturday; that Herold left the house alone,
</p>
<p>as one of the witnesses states, being seen to pass the window; that he alone of these
</p>
<p>two assassins was in the company of Dr. Mudd on his way to Bryantown. It does not
</p>
<p>appear when Herold returned to Mudd's house. It is a confession of Dr. Mudd him-
</p>
<p>self, proven by one of the witnesses, that Booth left his house on crutches and went in
</p>
<p>the direction of the swamp. How long he remained there, and what became of the
</p>
<p>horses which Booth and Herold rode to his house and which were put into his stable,
</p>
<p>4OO APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>are facts nowhere disclosed by the evidence. The owners testify that they have never
</p>
<p>seen the horses since. The accused give no explanation of the matter, and when Her-
</p>
<p>old and Booth were captured they had not these horses in their possession. How comes
</p>
<p>it that, on Mudd's return from Bryantown, on the evening of Saturday, in his conver-
</p>
<p>sation with Mr. Hardy and Mr. Farrell, the witnesses before referred to, he gave the
</p>
<p>name of Booth as the murderer of the President, and that of Boyle as the murderer of
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward and his son, and carefully avoided intimating to either that Booth had
</p>
<p>come to his house early that day and had remained there until the afternoon; that he
</p>
<p>left him in his house and had furnished him a razor with which Booth attempted to disguise
</p>
<p>himself by shaving off his moustache? How comes it, also, that, upon being asked by
</p>
<p>those two witnesses whether the Booth who killed the President was the one who had
</p>
<p>been there last fall, he answered that he did not know whether it was that man or one
</p>
<p>of his brothers, but he understood he had some brothers, and added, that if it was the
</p>
<p>Booth who was there last fall, he knew tkat one, but concealed the fact that this man
</p>
<p>had been at his house on that day and was then at his house, and had attempted in his
</p>
<p>presence to disguise his person? He was sorry, very sorry, that the thing had occurred,
</p>
<p>but not so sorry as to be willing to give any evidence to these two neighbors, who were
</p>
<p>manifestly honest and upright men, that the murderer had been harbored in his house
</p>
<p>all day, and was probably at that moment, as his own subsequent confession shows,
</p>
<p>lying concealed in his house or near by, subject to his call. This is the man who
</p>
<p>undertakes to show by his own declaration, offered in evidence against my protest, of
</p>
<p>what he said afterwards, on Sunday afternoon, the i6th, to his kinsman, Dr. George
</p>
<p>D. Mudd, to whom he then stated that the assassination of the President was a most
</p>
<p>damnable act a conclusion in which most men will agree with him, and to establish
</p>
<p>which his testimony was not needed. But it is to be remarked that this accused did
</p>
<p>not intimate that the man whom he knew the evening before was the murderer had
</p>
<p>found refuge in his house, had disguised his person, and sought concealment in the
</p>
<p>swamp upon the crutches which he had provided for him. Why did he conceal this
</p>
<p>fact from his kinsman? After the church services were over, however, in another con-
</p>
<p>versation on their way home, he did tell Dr. George Mudd that two suspicious persons
</p>
<p>had been at his house, who had come there a little before daybreak on Saturday morn-
</p>
<p>ing; that one of them had a broken leg, which he bandaged; that they got something
</p>
<p>to eat at his house; that they seemed to be laboring under more excitement than prob-
</p>
<p>ably would result from the injury; that they said they came from Bryantown, and

</p>
<p>inquired the way to Parson Wilmer's; that while at his house one of them called for
</p>
<p>a razor and shaved himself. The witness says, " I do not remember whether he said
</p>
<p>that this party shaved off his whiskers or his moustache, but he altered somewhat, or
</p>
<p>probably materially, his features." Finally, the prisoner, Dr. Mudd, told this witness
</p>
<p>that he, in company with the younger of the two men, went down the road towards
</p>
<p>Bryantown in search of a vehicle to take the wounded man away from his house. How
</p>
<p>comes it that he concealed in this conversation the fact proved, that he went with
</p>
<p>Herold towards Bryantown and left Herold outside of the town? How comes it that
</p>
<p>in this second conversation, on Sunday, insisted upon here with such pertinacity as
</p>
<p>evidence for the defense, but which had never been called for by the prosecution, he
</p>
<p>concealed from his kinsman the fact which he had disclosed the day before to Hardy
</p>
<p>and Farrell, that it was Booth who assassinated the President, and the fact which is
</p>
<p>now disclosed by his other confessions given in evidence for the prosecution, that it was
</p>
<p>Booth whom he had sheltered, concealed in his house, and aided to his hiding place in
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 401
</p>
<p>the swamp? He volunteers as evidence his further statement, however, to this witness,
</p>
<p>that on Sunday evening he requested the witness to state to the military authorities that
</p>
<p>two suspicious persons had been at his house, and see if anything could be made of it.
</p>
<p>He did not tell the witness what became of Herold, and where he parted, with him on
</p>
<p>the way to Bryantown. How comes it that when he was in Bryantown on the Saturday
</p>
<p>evening before, when he knew that Booth was then at his house, and that Booth was
</p>
<p>the murderer of the President, he did not himself state it to the military authorities
</p>
<p>then in that village, as he well knew? It is difficult to see what kindled his suspicions
</p>
<p>on Sunday, if none were in his mind on Saturday, when he was in possession of the
</p>
<p>fact that Booth had murdered the President and was then secreting and disguising
</p>
<p>himself in the prisoner's own house.
</p>
<p>His conversation with Gardner on the same Sunday at the church is also introduced
</p>
<p>here to relieve him from the overwhelming evidences of his guilt. He communicates
</p>
<p>nothing to Gardner of the fact that Booth had been in his house; nothing of the fact
</p>
<p>that he knew the day before that Booth had murdered the President; nothing of the
</p>
<p>fact that Booth had disguised or attempted to disguise himself; nothing of the fact that
</p>
<p>he had gone with Booth's associate, Herold, in search of a vehicle, the more speedily
</p>
<p>to expedite their flight; nothing of the fact that Booth had found concealment in the
</p>
<p>woods and swamp near his house upon the crutches which he had furnished him. He
</p>
<p>contents himself with merely stating " that we ought to raise immediately a home guard
</p>
<p>to hunt up all suspicious persons passing through our section of country and arrest
</p>
<p>them, for there were two suspicious persons at my house yesterday morning."
</p>
<p>It would have looked more like aiding justice and arresting felons if he had put in
</p>
<p>execution his project of a home guard on Saturday, and made it effective by the arrest
</p>
<p>of the man then in his house who had lodged with him last fall, with whom he had
</p>
<p>gone to purchase one of the very horses employed in this flight after the assassination,
</p>
<p>whom he had visited last winter in Washington, and to whom he had pointed out the
</p>
<p>very route by which he had escaped by way of his house, whom he had again visited on
</p>
<p>the 3d of last March, preparatory to the commission of this great crime, and who he
</p>
<p>knew, when he sheltered and concealed him in the woods on Saturday, was not merely
</p>
<p>a suspicious person, but was, in fact, the murderer and assassin of Abraham Lincoln.
</p>
<p>While I deem it my duty to say here, as I said before, when these declarations uttered
</p>
<p>by the accused on Sunday, the i6th, to Gardner and George D. Mudd, were attempted
</p>
<p>to be offered on the part of the accused, that they are in no sense evidence, and by the

</p>
<p>law were wholly inadmissible, yet I state it as my conviction that, being upon the record
</p>
<p>upon motion of the accused himself, so far as these declarations to Gardner and George
</p>
<p>D. Mudd go, they are additional indications of the guilt of the accused in this, that
</p>
<p>they are manifestly suppressions of the truth and suggestions of falsehood and decep-
</p>
<p>tion; they are but the utterances and confessions of guilt.
</p>
<p>To Lieutenant Lovett, Joshua Lloyd, and Simon Gavican, who, in pursuit of the
</p>
<p>murderer, visited his house on the i8th of April, the Tuesday after the murder, he
</p>
<p>denied positively, upon inquiry, that two men had passed his house, or had come to his
</p>
<p>house on the morning after the assassination. Two of these witnesses swear positively
</p>
<p>to his having made the denial, and the other says he hesitated to answer the question
</p>
<p>he put to him; all of them agree that he afterwards admitted that two men had been
</p>
<p>there, one of whom had a broken limb, which he had set; and when asked by this
</p>
<p>witness who that man was, he said he did not know that the man was a stranger to
</p>
<p>him, and that the two had been there but a short time. Lloyd asked him if he had
</p>
<p>402 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>ever seen any of the parties Booth, Herold, and Surratt, and he said he had never
</p>
<p>seen them; while it is positively proved that he was acquainted with John H. Surratt,
</p>
<p>who had been in his house; that he knew Booth, and had introduced Booth to Surratt
</p>
<p>last winter. Afterwards, on Friday, the 2ist, he admitted to Lloyd that he had been
</p>
<p>introduced to Booth last fall, and that this man who came to his house on Saturday, the
</p>
<p>1 5th, remained there from about four o'clock in the morning until about four in the
</p>
<p>afternoon; that one of them left his house on horseback, and the other walking. In
</p>
<p>the first conversation he denied ever having seen these men.
</p>
<p>Colonel Wells also testifies that, in his conversation with Dr. Mudd on Friday the
</p>
<p>2ist, the prisoner said that he had gone to Bryantown, or near Bryantown, to see some
</p>
<p>friends on Saturday, and that as he came back to his own house he saw the person he
</p>
<p>afterwards supposed to be Herold passing to the left of his house toward the barn, but
</p>
<p>that he did not see the other person at all after he left him in his own house about one
</p>
<p>o'clock. If this statement be true, how did Dr. Mudd see the same person leave his
</p>
<p>house on crutches? He further stated to this witness that he returned to his own house
</p>
<p>about four o'clock in the afternoon; that he did not know this wounded man; said he
</p>
<p>could not recognize him from the photograph which is of record here, but admitted
</p>
<p>that he had met Booth some time in November, when he had some conversation with
</p>
<p>him about lands and horses; that Booth had remained with him that night in Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, and on the next day had purchased a horse. He said he had not again seen Booth
</p>
<p>from the time of the introduction in November up to his arrival at his house on the
</p>
<p>Saturday morning after the assassination. Is not this a confession that he did see John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth on that morning at his house and knew it was Booth? If he did not
</p>
<p>know him, how came he to make this statement to the witness: that " he had not seen
</p>
<p>Booth after November prior to his arrival there on the Saturday morning ' ' ?
</p>
<p>He had said before to the same witness he did not know the wounded man. He
</p>
<p>said further to Colonel Wells, that when he went upstairs after their arrival he noticed
</p>
<p>that the person he supposed to be Booth had shaved off his moustache. Is it not infer-
</p>
<p>able from this declaration that he then supposed him to be Booth ? Yet he declared the
</p>
<p>same afternoon, and while Booth was in his own house, that Booth was the murderer
</p>
<p>of the President. One of the most remarkable statements made to this witness by the
</p>
<p>prisoner was that he heard for the first time on Sunday morning, or late in the evening of
</p>
<p>Saturday, that the President had been murdered! From whom did he hear it? The
</p>
<p>witness (Colonel Wells) volunteers his "impression" that Dr. Mudd had said he had
</p>

</p>
<p>heard it after the persons had left his house. If the " impression " of the witness thus
</p>
<p>volunteered is to be taken as evidence and the counsel for the accused, judging from
</p>
<p>their manner, seem to think it ought to be let this question be answered: how could
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd have made that impression upon anybody truthfully, when it is proved by
</p>
<p>Farrell and Hardy that on his return from Bryantown, on Saturday afternoon, he not
</p>
<p>only stated that the President, Mr. Seward, and his son had been assassinated, but that
</p>
<p>Boyle had assassinated Mr. Seward, and Booth had assassinated the President?
</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that he said to this witness that he left his own house at one o'clock
</p>
<p>and when he returned the men were gone, yet it is in evidence, by his own declarations,
</p>
<p>that Booth left his house at four o'clock on crutches, and he must have been there to
</p>
<p>have seen it or he could not have known the fact.
</p>
<p>Mr. Williams testifies that he was at Mudd's house on Tuesday, the i8th of April,
</p>
<p>when he said that strangers had not been that way, and also declared that he heard,
</p>
<p>for the first time, of the assassination of the President on Sunday morning at church.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 403
</p>
<p>Afterwards, on Friday, the 2lst, Mr. Williams asked him concerning the men who had
</p>
<p>been at his house, one of whom had a broken limb, and he confessed they had been
</p>
<p>there. Upon being asked if they were Booth and Herold, he said they were not
</p>
<p>that he knew Booth. I think it is fair to conclude that he did know Booth when we
</p>
<p>consider the testimony_of Wiechmann, of Norton, of Evans, and all the testimony just
</p>
<p>referred to, wherein he declares, himself, that he not only knew him, but that he had
</p>
<p>lodged with him, and that he had himself gone with him when he purchased his horse
</p>
<p>from Gardner last fall, for the very purpose of aiding the flight of himself or some of
</p>
<p>his confederates.
</p>
<p>All these circumstances taken together, which, as we have seen upon high authority,
</p>
<p>are stronger as evidences of guilt than even direct testimony, leave no further room for
</p>
<p>argument and no rational doubt that Doctor Samuel A. Mudd was as certainly in this
</p>
<p>conspiracy as were Booth and Herold, whom he sheltered and entertained; receiving
</p>
<p>them under cover of darkness on the morning after the assassination, concealing them
</p>
<p>throughout that day from the hand of offended justice, and aiding them, by every
</p>
<p>endeavor, to pursue their way successfully to their co-conspirator, Arnold, at Fortress
</p>
<p>Monroe, and in which direction they fled until overtaken and Booth was slain.
</p>
<p>We next find Herold and his confederate Booth, after their departure from the house
</p>
<p>of Mudd, across the Potomac in the neighborhood of Port Conway, on Monday, the
</p>
<p>24th of of April, conveyed in a wagon. There Herold, in order to obtain the aid of
</p>
<p>Captain Jett, Ruggles, and Bainbridge, of the confederate army, said to Jett, "We
</p>
<p>are the assassinators of the President "; that this was his brother with him, who, with
</p>
<p>himself, belonged to A. P. Hill's corps; that his brother had been wounded at Peters-
</p>
<p>burg; that their names were Boyd. He requested Jett and his rebel companions to
</p>
<p>take them out of the lines. After this Booth joined these parties, was placed on Rug-
</p>
<p>gles's horse, and crossed the Rappahannock River. They then proceeded to the house
</p>
<p>of Garrett, in the neighborhood of Port Royal, and nearly midway between Washing-
</p>
<p>ton City and Fortress Monroe, where they were to have joined Arnold. Before these
</p>
<p>rebel guides and guards parted with them, Herold confessed they were traveling under
</p>
<p>assumed names that his own name was Herold, and that the name of the wounded
</p>
<p>man was John Wilkes Booth, "who had killed the President." The rebels left Booth
</p>
<p>at Garrett's, where Herold revisited him from time to time, until they were captured.
</p>
<p>At two o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 26th, a party of United States officers and
</p>
<p>soldiers surrounded Garrett's barn where Booth and Herold lay concealed, and demanded
</p>

</p>
<p>their surrender. Booth cursed Herold, calling him a coward, and bade him go, when
</p>
<p>Herold came out and surrendered himself, was taken into custody, and is now brought
</p>
<p>into court. The barn was then set on fire, when Booth sprang to his feet, amid the
</p>
<p>flames that were kindling about him, carbine in hand, and approached the door, seek-
</p>
<p>ing, by the flashing light of the fire, to find some new victim for his murderous hand,
</p>
<p>when he was shot, as he deserved to be, by Sergeant Corbett, in order to save his com-
</p>
<p>rades from wounds or death by the hands of this desperate assassin. Upon his person
</p>
<p>was found the following bill of exchange :
</p>
<p>"No. 1492. The Ontario Bank, Montreal Branch. Exchange for 61 12s. lod.
</p>
<p>Montreal, 27th October, 1864. Sixty days after sight of this first of exchange, second
</p>
<p>and third of the same tenor and date, pay to the order of J. Wilkes Booth 61 I2s.
</p>
<p>lod. sterling, value received, and charge to the account of this office. H. Stanus,
</p>
<p>manager. To Messrs. Glynn, Mills & Co., London.
</p>
<p>Thus fell, by the hands of one of the defenders of the republic, this hired assassin,
</p>
<p>404 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>who, for a price, murdered Abraham Lincoln, bearing upon his person, as this bill of
</p>
<p>exchange testifies, additional evidence of the fact that he had undertaken, in aid of the
</p>
<p>rebellion, this work of assassination by the hands of himself and his confederates, f-or
</p>
<p>such sum as the accredited agents of Jefferson Davis might pay him or them, out of the
</p>
<p>funds of the Confederacy, which, as is in evidence, they had in "any amount" in
</p>
<p>Canada for the purpose of rewarding conspirators, spies, poisoners, and assassins, who
</p>
<p>might take service under their false commissions, and do the work of the incendiary
</p>
<p>and the murderer upon the lawful representatives of the American people, to whom
</p>
<p>had been entrusted the care of the republic, the maintenance of the Constitution, and
</p>
<p>the execution of the laws.
</p>
<p>The court will remember that it is in the testimony of Merritt and Montgomery and
</p>
<p>Conover that Thompson and Sanders and Clay and Cleary made their boasts that they
</p>
<p>had money in Canada for this very purpose. Nor is it to be overlooked or forgotten
</p>
<p>that the officers of the Ontario Bank at Montreal testify that during the current year of
</p>
<p>this conspiracy and assassination Jacob Thompson had on deposit in that bank the sum
</p>
<p>of six hundred and forty-nine thousand dollars, and that these deposits to the credit of
</p>
<p>Jacob Thompson accrued from the negotiation of bills of exchange drawn by the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Treasury of the so-called Confederate States on Frazier, Trenholm, & Co.,
</p>
<p>of Liverpool, who were known to be the financial agents of the Confederate States.
</p>
<p>With an undrawn deposit in this bank of four hundred and fifty-five dollars, which has
</p>
<p>remained to his credit since October last, and with an unpaid bill of exchange drawn
</p>
<p>by the same bank upon London, in his possession and found upon his person, Booth
</p>
<p>ends his guilty career in this work of conspiracy and blood in April. 1865, as he began
</p>
<p>it in October, 1864, in combination with Jefferson Davis, Jacob Thompson, George N.
</p>
<p>Sanders, Clement C. Clay, William C. Cleary, Beverly Tucker, and other co-conspir-
</p>
<p>ators, making use of the money of the rebel confederation to aid in the execution and
</p>
<p>in the flight, bearing at the moment of his death upon his person their money, part of
</p>
<p>the price which they paid for his great crime, to aid him in its consummation and secure
</p>
<p>him afterwards from arrest and the just penalty which by the law of God and the law
</p>
<p>of man is denounced against treasonable conspiracy and murder.
</p>
<p>By all the testimony in the case it is, in my judgment, made as clear as any transac-
</p>
<p>tion can be shown by human testimony, that John Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>and the several accused, David E. Herold, George A. Atzerodt, Lewis Payne, Michael
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, Edward Spangler, Samuel Arnold, Mary E. Surratt, and Samuel A. Mudd,

<p>did, with intent to aid the existing rebellion and to subvert the Constitution and laws
</p>
<p>of the United States, in the month of October last and thereafter, combine, confederate,
</p>
<p>and conspire with Jefferson Davis, George N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob Thomp-
</p>
<p>son, William C. Cleary, Clement C. Clay, George Harper, George Young, and others
</p>
<p>unknown, to kill and murder, within the military department of Washington, and
</p>
<p>within the intrenched fortifications and military lines thereof, Abraham Lincoln, then
</p>
<p>President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy thereof;
</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson, Vice-President of the United States; William H. Seward, Secretary
</p>
<p>of State; and Ulysses S. Grant, lieutenant general in command of the armies of the
</p>
<p>United States; and that Jefferson Davis, the chief of this rebellion, was the instigator
</p>
<p>and procurer, through his accredited agents in Canada, of this treasonable conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It is also submitted to the court, that it is clearly established by the testimony that
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, in pursuance of this conspiracy, so entered into by him and the
</p>
<p>accused, did, on the night of the I4th of April, 1865, within the military department

<p>APPENDIX. 405
</p>
<p>of Washington, and the intrenched fortifications and military lines thereof, and with
</p>
<p>the intent laid, inflict a mortal wound upon Abraham Lincoln, then President and Com-
</p>
<p>mander -in-Chief of the army and navy of the United States, whereof he died; that in
</p>
<p>pursuance of the same conspiracy and within the said department and intrenched lines,
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne assaulted, with intent to kill and murder, William H. Seward, then Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of State of the United States; that George A. Atzerodt, in pursuance of the same
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and within the said department, laid in wait, with intent to kill and murder
</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson, then Vice-President of the United States; that Michael O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>within said department, and in pursuance of said conspiracy, laid in wait to kill and
</p>
<p>murder Ulysses S. Grant, then in command of the armies of the United States; and
</p>
<p>that Mary E. Surratt, David E. Herold, Samuel Arnold, Samuel A. Mudd, and Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler did encourage, aid, and abet the commission of said several acts in the prose-
</p>
<p>cution of said conspiracy.
</p>
<p>If this treasonable conspiracy has not been wholly executed; if the several executive
</p>
<p>officers of the United States and the commander of its armies, to kill and murder whom
</p>
<p>the said several accused thus confederated and conspired, have not each and all fallen
</p>
<p>by the hands of these conspirators, thereby leaving the people of the United States
</p>
<p>without a President or Vice-President; without a Secretary of State, who alone is
</p>
<p>clothed with authority by the law to call an election to fill the vacancy, should any
</p>
<p>arise, in the offices of President and Vice-President; and without a lawful commander
</p>
<p>of the armies of the republic, it is only because the conspirators were deterred by the
</p>
<p>vigilance and fidelity of the executive officers, whose lives were rriercifully protected on
</p>
<p>that night of murder by the care of the Infinite Being who has thus far saved the repub-
</p>
<p>lic and crowned its arms with victory.
</p>
<p>If this conspiracy was thus entered into by the accused; if John Wilkes Booth did
</p>
<p>kill and murder Abraham Lincoln in pursuance thereof; if Lewis Payne did, in pursu-
</p>
<p>ance of said conspiracy, assault with intent to kill and murder William H. Seward, as
</p>
<p>stated, and if the several parties accused did commit the several acts alleged against
</p>
<p>them in the prosecution of said conspiracy, then it is the law that all the parties to that
</p>
<p>conspiracy, whether present at the time of its execution or not, whether on trial before
</p>
<p>this court or not, are alike guilty of the several acts done by each in the execution of
</p>
<p>the common design. What these conspirators did in the execution of this conspiracy
</p>
<p>by the hand of one of their co-conspirators they did themselves; his act, done in the
</p>
<p>prosecution of the common design, was the act of all the parties to the treasonable

<p>combination, because done in execution and furtherance of their guilty and treasonable
</p>
<p>agreement.
</p>
<p>As we have seen, this is the rule, whether all the conspirators are indicted or not;
</p>
<p>whether they are all on trial or not. " It is not material what the nature of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment is, provided the offense involve a conspiracy. Upon indictment for murder, for
</p>
<p>instance, if it appear that others, together with the prisoner, conspired to perpetrate the
</p>
<p>crime, the act of one done in pursuance of that intention would be evidence against
</p>
<p>the rest." (i Whar. 706.) To the same effect are the words of Chief Justice Mar-
</p>
<p>' shall, before cited, that whoever leagued in a general conspiracy, performed any part,
</p>
<p>however MINUTE, or however REMOTE, from the scene of action, are guilty as princi-
</p>
<p>pals. In this treasonable conspiracy to aid the existing armed rebellion by murdering
</p>
<p>the executive officers of the United States and the commander of its armies, all the
</p>
<p>parties to it must be held as principals, and the act of one in the prosecution of the
</p>
<p>common design the act of all.
</p>
<p>406 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>I leave the decision of this dread issue with the court, to which alone it belongs.
</p>
<p>It is for you to say, upon your oaths, whether the accused are guilty.
</p>
<p>I am not conscious that in this argument I have made any erroneous statement of
</p>
<p>the evidence, or drawn any erroneous conclusions; yet I pray the court, out of tender
</p>
<p>regard and jealous care for the rights of the accused, to see that no error of mine, if
</p>
<p>any there be, shall work them harm. The past services of the members of this honor-
</p>
<p>able court give assurance that, without fear, favor, or affection, they will discharge with
</p>
<p>fidelity the duty enjoined upon them by their oaths. Whatever else may befall, I trust
</p>
<p>in God that in this, as in every other American court, the rights of the whole people
</p>
<p>will be respected, and that the republic in this, its supreme hour of trial, will be true
</p>
<p>to itself and just to all ready to protect the rights of the humblest, to redress every
</p>
<p>wrong, to avenge every crime, to vindicate the majesty of law, and to maintain invio-
</p>
<p>late the Constitution, whether assailed secretly or openly, by hosts armed with gold, or

<p>THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN PRESIDENT JOHNSON
</p>
<p>AND JUDGE HOLT.
</p>
<p>A Paper read by GEN. HENRY L. BURNETT, late U. S. V., at a Meeting of the Com-
</p>
<p>mandery, State of New Vork, Military Order, Loyal Legion, April j, 1889.
</p>
<p>PERHAPS no incident connected with the trial of the assassins of President Lincoln
</p>
<p>created more general interest was so much discussed and commented upon by the
</p>
<p>public press, or aroused deeper feeling of antagonism and bitterness between two public
</p>
<p>men, than the charge by President Johnson that the Judge Advocate General, Judge
</p>
<p>Holt, had withheld or suppressed the recommendation to mercy of Mrs. Surratt, signed
</p>
<p>by five members of the commission, .when he represented to him, the President, the
</p>
<p>record for his official action. While this charge had circulation and was asserted in the
</p>
<p>press during the time Mr. Johnson was occupying the presidential office, Mr. Johnson
</p>
<p>never openly made the charge until after his term had expired, some time in 1873.
</p>
<p>No graver charge could be made against a public officer than this against Judge
</p>
<p>Holt, and, if true, no more cruel and treacherous betrayal of a public trust was ever
</p>
<p>committed by a man in high official position. It would be murderous in intent and
</p>
<p>effect. This charge rested, so far as human testimony went, upon the solemn assertion
</p>
<p>alone of President Johnson, and, if untrue, was one of the most cruel wrongs ever
</p>
<p>perpetrated by one man against another. I propose to give a brief abstract of the testi-
</p>
<p>mony produced by Judge Holt to disprove this charge, and also a statement of my
</p>
<p>connection with, and what little personal knowledge I had of the matter.
</p>
<p>In a communication addressed to the Washington Chronicle, dated August 25,
</p>
<p>1873, Judge Holt gives a copy of a letter addressed by him to the Secretary of War, on
</p>
<p>the I4th of that month, in which he sets forth evidence tending to disprove the charge
</p>
<p>originating with Andrew Johnson, of his suppression of the petition, signed by five of
</p>
<p>the nine members of the commission, recommending, in consideration of her age and
</p>
<p>sex, a commutation of the death sentence of Mary E. Surratt to imprisonment for life
</p>
<p>in the penitentiary. The petition read as follows: " To the President : The undersigned,
</p>
<p>members of the military commission appointed to try the persons charged with the
</p>
<p>murder of Abraham Lincoln, etc., respectfully represent that the commission have been
</p>
<p>constrained to find Mary E. Surratt guilty, upon the testimony, of the assassination of
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United States, and to pronounce upon her, as
</p>
<p>required by law, the sentence of death; but in consideration of her age and sex, the
</p>
<p>undersigned pray your Excellency, if it is consistent with your sense of duty, to commute
</p>
<p>her sentence to imprisonment for life in the penitentiary."

</p>
<p>In a letter dated February n, 1873, addressed to Hon. John A. Bingham, one of
</p>
<p>the special Judge Advocates during the trial, Judge Holt states: "In the discharge of
</p>
<p>my duty when presenting that record to President Johnson, I drew his attention to that
</p>
<p>407
</p>
<p>4O8 THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
</p>
<p>recommendation, and he read it in my presence, and before approving the proceedings
</p>
<p>and sentence. He and I were together alone when this duty on his part and on mine
</p>
<p>was performed. . . . The President and myself having, as already stated, been
</p>
<p>alone at the time, I have not been able to obtain any .positive proof on the point,
</p>
<p>although I have been able to collect circumstantial evidence enough to satisfy any un-
</p>
<p>biased mind that the recommendation was seen and considered by the President,
</p>
<p>when he examined and approved the proceeding and sentence of the court. Still, in a
</p>
<p>matter so deeply affecting my reputation and official honor, I am naturally desirous of
</p>
<p>having the testimony in my possession strengthened as far as practicable, and hence it is
</p>
<p>that I trouble you with this note. While I know that the question of extending to Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt the clemency sought by the petition was considered by the President at the time
</p>
<p>mentioned, I have, in view of its gravity, been always satisfied that it must have been
</p>
<p>considered by the Cabinet also; but from the confidential character of Cabinet delibera-
</p>
<p>tions I have thus far been denied access to this source of information." He then
</p>
<p>proceeds to inquire whether or not he (Judge Bingham) had any conversation with
</p>
<p>Secretary Seward or Mr. Stanton in reference to this petition, and if so to please give
</p>
<p>him as nearly as he (Judge Bingham) could, all that Secretary Seward or Mr. Stanton
</p>
<p>had said upon the subject.
</p>
<p>Judge Bingham replied under date of February 17, 1873, and among other things
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>" Before the President had acted upon the case, I deemed it my duty to call the
</p>
<p>attention of Secretary Stanton to the petition for the commutation of sentence upon Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, and did call his attention to it, before the final decision of the President.
</p>
<p>After the execution, the statement which you refer to was made that President Johnson
</p>
<p>had not seen the petition for the commutation of the death sentence upon Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>I afterwards called at your office, and, without notice to you of my purpose, asked for
</p>
<p>the record of the case of the assassins; it was opened and shown me, and there was-
</p>
<p>then attached to it the petition, copied and signed as hereinbefore stated. Soon there-
</p>
<p>after I called upon Secretaries Stanton and Seward and asked if this petition had been
</p>
<p>presented to the President before the death sentence was by him approved, and was
</p>
<p>answered by each of those gentlemen that the petition was presented to the President,
</p>
<p>and was duly considered by him and his advisers before the death sentence upon Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt was approved, and that the President and Cabinet, upon such consideration,
</p>
<p>were a unit in denying the prayer of the petition; Mr. Stanton and Mr. Seward stating
</p>

</p>
<p>that they were present.
</p>
<p>" Having ascertained the fact as stated, I then desired to make the same public, and
</p>
<p>so expressed myself to Mr. Stanton, who advised me not to do so, but to rely upon the
</p>
<p>final judgement of the people."
</p>
<p>In replying to this letter, Judge Holt very justly remarks: " It would have been very
</p>
<p>fortunate for me indeed could I have had this testimony in my possession years ago.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton's advice to you was, under all the circumstances of the case, most
</p>
<p>extraordinary.
</p>
<p>..(
</p>
<p>"The asking you 'to rely upon the final judgment of the people,' and at the same
</p>
<p>time withholding from them the proof on which the judgment to be just must be
</p>
<p>formed, was a sad, sad mockery."
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND JUDGE HOLT. 409
</p>
<p>The next is a letter from ex-Attorney General Speed, dated March 30, 1873, in which
</p>
<p>he says: " After the finding of the military commission that tried the assassins of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln and before their execution, I saw the record of the case in the President's
</p>
<p>office, and attached to it was a paper, signed by some of the members of the commission,
</p>
<p>recommending that the sentence against Mrs. Surratt be commuted to imprisonment for
</p>
<p>life; and according to my memory, the recommendation was made because of her sex.
</p>
<p>"I do not feel at liberty to speak of what was said at Cabinet meetings. In this I
</p>
<p>know I differ from other gentlemen, but feel constrained to follow my own sense of
</p>
<p>propriety."
</p>
<p>So that it is most clear from this statement of Attorney General Speed, unless he,
</p>
<p>without interest or motive, stated a most deliberate falsehood, that Judge Holt did not
</p>
<p>" withhold " or " suppress " the recommendation to mercy, but carried it with the record
</p>
<p>and " attached to it, " as Mr. Speed says, and deliveredit in the President's office.
</p>
<p>Certainly every intelligent mind will concede that this testimony of Mr. Speed utterly
</p>
<p>disposes of the charge of Andrew Johnson that Judge Holt "suppressed" or "with-
</p>
<p>held" this recommendation to mercy. If Mr. Johnson did not see it or read it when
</p>
<p>in his office, that was his neglect, his failure to perform a solemn official duty. But on
</p>
<p>this question of his having read and considered it, how stands the evidence? Judge
</p>
<p>Holt states that he drew his attention to it, and that Mr. Johnson read it in his presence.
</p>
<p>Judge Bingham says both Mr. Stanton and Mr. Seward stated to him that this petition
</p>
<p>had been presented to the President and was duly considered by him and his advisers
</p>
<p>before the death sentence upon Mrs. Surratt was approved. Under date of May 27,
</p>
<p>1873, James Harlan, a former member of Mr. Johnson's Cabinet, addressed a letter to
</p>
<p>Judge Holt, in which he said: "After the sentence and before the execution of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, I remember distinctly the discussion of the question of the commutation of the
</p>
<p>sentence of death pronounced on her by the Court to imprisonment for life had by
</p>
<p>members of the Cabinet in presence of President Johnson. I can not state positively
</p>
<p>whether this occurred at a regular or a called meeting, or whether it was at an
</p>
<p>accidental meeting of several members, each calling on the President in relation to the
</p>
<p>business of his own department. The impression on my mind is, that the only discus-
</p>
<p>sion of the subject by members of the Cabinet, which I ever heard, occurred in the last-
</p>
<p>named mode, there being not more than three or four members present Mr. Seward,
</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton, and myself, and probably Attorney General Speed and others but I
</p>
<p>distinctly remember only the first two. When I entered the room, one of these was

</p>
<p>addressing the President in an earnest conversation on the question whether the sentence
</p>
<p>ought to be modified on account of the sex of the condemned. I can recite the precise
</p>
<p>thought, if not the very words, used by this eminent statesman, as they were impressed
</p>
<p>on my mind with great force at the time, and I have often thought of them since, viz. :
</p>
<p>' Surely not, Mr. President, for if the death penalty should be commuted in so grave a
</p>
<p>case as the assassination of the head of a great nation, on account of the sex of the
</p>
<p>criminal, it would amount to an invitation to assassins hereafter to employ women as their
</p>
<p>instruments, under the belief that if arrested and condemned, they would be punished
</p>
<p>less severely than men. An act of executive clemency on such a plea would be disap-
</p>
<p>proved by the government of every civilized nation on earth.' "
</p>
<p>Judge Harlan adds that he made inquiry at the time, and "was told that the whole
</p>
<p>case had been carefully examined by the Attorney General and the Secretary of War;
</p>
<p>and that the only question raised was whether the punishment shall be reduced on
</p>
<p>account of the sex of the party condemned. I do not remember that any differences of
</p>
<p>opinion were expressed on that point."
</p>
<p>41 THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
</p>
<p>This is indirect but very conclusive evidence that the petition was attached to the
</p>
<p>record submitted to the President and examined by the Attorney General and Secretary
</p>
<p>of War; and that the subject of the mitigation of Mrs. Surratt's sentence was considered
</p>
<p>by the President and these members of his Cabinet, because in no part of the record
</p>
<p>was there the slightest allusion to the question of clemency to Mrs. Surratt, or to any of
</p>
<p>the other convicted persons, except in the petition signed by the five members of the
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>The next is a letter from the Rev. J. George Butler, pastor of St. Paul's Church,
</p>
<p>Washington. Under date of December 5, 1868, in describing an interview he had with
</p>
<p>President Johnson, he says: "The interview occurred during a social call upon the
</p>
<p>family of the President in the evening, a few hours after the execution.
</p>
<p>" I had been summoned by the Government, I then being a hospital chaplain, to
</p>
<p>attend upon Atzerodt, and was present at the execution.
</p>
<p>" Concerning Mrs. Surratt, the remarks of the President, by reason of their point ana
</p>
<p>force, impressed themselves upon my memory. He said, in substance, that very strong
</p>
<p>appeals had been made for the exercise of executive clemency; that he had been
</p>
<p>importuned; that telegrams and threats had been used; but he could not be moved,
</p>
<p>for, in his own significant language, Mrs. Surratt 'kept the nest that hatched the eggs.'
</p>
<p>"The President further stated that no plea had been urged in her behalf, save the
</p>
<p>fact that she was a woman, and his interposition upon that ground would license female
</p>
<p>crime."
</p>
<p>This harmonizes entirely with the " thought " which Secretary Harlan heard uttered
</p>
<p>with so much force by a member of the Cabinet in Mr. Johnson's presence either Mr.
</p>
<p>Stanton or Mr. Seward and from his language, " this eminent statesman, " I take it
</p>
<p>to have been Mr. Seward.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Butler adds: " I feel it due to a Christian soldier and personal friend
</p>
<p>(General Eakin) to make this statement, showing clearly that at the time of the execution
</p>
<p>the President's judgment wholly accorded with the judgment of the military commission;
</p>
<p>and that no appeals could then change his purpose to make ' treason odious.' "
</p>
<p>General R. D. Mussey, under date of August 19, 1873, writes to Judge Holt:
</p>
<p>" In a few days after the assassination I was detailed for duty with Mr. Johnson and
</p>
<p>acted as one of his secretaries, and was an inmate of his household until some time in
</p>
<p>the fall of 1865.
</p>
<p>"About the time the military court that tried Mrs. Surratt concluded its labors, I

</p>
<p>was, if I remember aright, for some days the only person acting as private secretary at
</p>
<p>the White House, my associate being absent on a visit.
</p>
<p>' ' On the Wednesday previous to the execution ( which was on Friday, July 7, 1 865 ) , as
</p>
<p>I was sitting at my desk in the morning, Mr. Johnson told me that he was going to look
</p>
<p>over the findings of the Court with Judge Holt, and should be busy and could see no
</p>
<p>one. I replied, ' Very well, sir, I will see that you not interrupted, ' or something to
</p>
<p>that effect, and continued my work. I think it was two or three hours after that that
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson came out of the room where he had been with you, and said that the papers
</p>
<p>had been looked over and a decision reached. I asked what it was. He told me, ap-
</p>
<p>proval of the findings and sentence of the Court; and he then gave me the sentences as
</p>
<p>near as he remembered them, and said that he had ordered the sentence where it was
</p>
<p>death to be carried into execution on the Friday following. I remember looking up
</p>
<p>from my desk with some surprise at the brevity of this interval, and asking him whether
</p>
<p>the time wasn't rather short. He admitted that it was, but said that they had had ever
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND JUDGE HOLT. 41 1
</p>
<p>since the trial began for ' preparation ' ; and either then or later on in the day spoke of
</p>
<p>his design in making the time short, so that there might be less opportunity for criticism,
</p>
<p>remonstrance, etc. I do not pretend to use his precise language as to this, but the pur-
</p>
<p>port of it was that ' it was a disagreeable duty, and there would be endeavors to get him
</p>
<p>not to perform it, and he wished to avoid them as much as possible.' . . . I am very
</p>
<p>confident, though not absolutely assured, that it was at this interview Mr. Johnson told
</p>
<p>me that the Court had recommended Mrs. Surratt to mercy on the ground of her sex
</p>
<p>(and age, I believe). But I am certain he did so inform me about that time; and that
</p>
<p>he said he thought the grounds urged insufficient, and that he had refused to interfere;
</p>
<p>that if she was guilty at all, her sex did not make her any the less guilty; that he, about
</p>
<p>the time of her execution, justified it; that he told me there had not been women enough
</p>
<p>hanged in this war. "
</p>
<p>This evidence would seem to establish most conclusively that the, " petition " was
</p>
<p>not only attached to the record, and delivered by Judge Holt at the President's office in
</p>
<p>the Executive Mansion, but that he read the same and afterward considered and dis-
</p>
<p>cussed it with at least three members of his Cabinet; and intelligent charity can reach
</p>
<p>no further than to say that President Johnson, when he charged Judge Holt with having
</p>
<p>withheld this recommendation to mercy when he delivered the record of the trial at the
</p>
<p>President's Mansion, made a cruel and untruthful charge; and that when he asserted in
</p>
<p>1873 that he had not seen, read, or heard of this recommendation to mercy, at the time
</p>
<p>he approved the sentences on the 5th day of July, 1865, had forgotten the facts that
</p>
<p>his " forgettery " was much better than his memory.
</p>
<p>One of the main points in President Johnson's response to this evidence was that in
</p>
<p>the published volume of the record of the trial of the assassins, prepared by Mr. Ben.
</p>
<p>Pittmann, of Cincinnati, under my official supervision, this recommendation to mercy
</p>
<p>does not appear. There is no force in this. The petition or recommendation to mercy
</p>
<p>constituted properly no part of the official record of the trial. Mr. Pittmann, who had
</p>
<p>his desk and place in my office at the War Department, was one of the official stenog-
</p>
<p>raphers of the court, and had special charge and custody of the record from day to day.
</p>
<p>The other reporters sent in to him their portions of the testimony as they were written up,
</p>
<p>and thereafter he was responsible for them. My recollection is also that as the testimony
</p>
<p>was written up a press copy was made of it, which he (Mr. Pittmann) took with him to
</p>
<p>Cincinnati, and used, after he had received permission from the War Department to
</p>
<p>publish.

</p>
<p>The commission met with closed doors at 10 A. M. on the agth of June to consider
</p>
<p>its findings, and continued and concluded its labors with closed doors on the 3oth.
</p>
<p>From these meetings all stenographic reporters were excluded. The findings and sen-
</p>
<p>tences, when finally made and recorded, were handed to me to be attached to the record,
</p>
<p>or to go with the record to the Judge Advocate General's office, as was then the course
</p>
<p>of procedure. By the oath administered, all the members of the commission, as well as
</p>
<p>the Judge Advocates, were bound not to reveal those findings and sentences. I there-
</p>
<p>fore retained them in my possession, instead of passing them on to the stenographers.
</p>
<p>When the recommendation to mercy was drawn, and signed by five members of the
</p>
<p>commission, that was also handed to me to accompany the findings.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pittmann never saw, I presume, either the original findings or the recommendation
</p>
<p>to mercy, and the first knowledge he had of the former doubtless was after they were
</p>
<p>promulgated by the Adjutant General on the 5th day of July. This is evidenced by the
</p>
<p>fact that the Adjutant General, in promulgating the proceedings, took Mrs. Surratt's
</p>
<p>412 THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
</p>
<p>name from the position it occupies in the records, and placed it next that of Payne,,
</p>
<p>evidently for the purpose of grouping together the four persons condemned to death.,
</p>
<p>Mr. Pittmann gives the findings and sentence in the order promulgated by the Adjutant
</p>
<p>General that is to say, he places the findings and sentence in Mrs. Surratt's case next
</p>
<p>after that of Lewis Payne; while the Court, in making up its findings, followed the order
</p>
<p>named in the charge and specifications, where Mrs. Surratt's name follows that of Sam-
</p>
<p>uel Arnold.
</p>
<p>When I reached my office at the War Department on the 3oth possibly on the
</p>
<p>morning of the 1st of July I attached the petition or recommendation to mercy of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt to the findings and sentence, and at the end of them, and then directed some one
</p>
<p>probably Mr. Pittmann to carry the record of the evidence to the Judge Advocate-
</p>
<p>General's office. I carried the findings and sentences and the petition or recommendation
</p>
<p>and delivered them to the Judge Advocate General in person or to the clerk in charge
</p>
<p>of court-martial records. Before leaving the War Department I may have attached these
</p>
<p>findings and sentences and petition to the last few days of testimony, and carried that to
</p>
<p>the Judge Advocate General's office. I never saw the record again until many years after
</p>
<p>I think in 1873 or 1874.
</p>
<p>I left Washington several days before, and was not there on the day of the execution.
</p>
<p>My recollection is, that I left there either on the evening of the 5th or on the morning of
</p>
<p>the 6th of July. On the 5th day of July, when Judge Holt had his conference with
</p>
<p>President Johnson over the record and proceedings of the military commission, when the
</p>
<p>President considered and passed upon the findings and sentences of the accused persons,
</p>
<p>after that interview Judge Holt came directly to Mr. Stanton's office in the War Depart-
</p>
<p>ment. I happened to be with Mr. Stanton as Judge Holt came in. After greetings,
</p>
<p>the latter remarked, " I have just come from a conference with the President over the
</p>
<p>proceedings of the military commission. " " Well, " said Mr. Stanton, " what has he
</p>
<p>done?" " He has approved the findings and sentence of the Court," replied Judge Holt.
</p>
<p>" What did he say about the recommendation to mercy of Mrs. Surratt? " next in-
</p>
<p>quired Mr. Stanton. " He said, " answered Judge Holt, " that she must be punished
</p>
<p>with the rest ; that no reasons were given for his interposition by those asking for clem-
</p>
<p>ency, in her case, except age and sex. He said her sex furnished no good ground for
</p>
<p>his interfering; that women and men should learn that if women committed crimes they
</p>
<p>would be punished; that if they entered into conspiracies to assassinate, they must suffer
</p>
<p>the penalty; that were this not so, hereafter conspirators and assassins would use women

</p>
<p>as their instruments; it would be mercy to womankind to let Mrs. Surratt suffer the pen-
</p>
<p>alty of her crime. " After some futher conversation, and after making known to Mr.
</p>
<p>Stanton that the President had fixed Friday, the 7th, as the day of execution, Judge
</p>
<p>Holt left. In giving the above conversation I cannot say that I have given the exact
</p>
<p>words; but the substance of what Judge Holt said I know I have given. It is indelibly
</p>
<p>impressed upon my memory. This conversation, while it does not constitute legal evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the fact of President Johnson's consideration of the recommendation to mercy,
</p>
<p>has always been a circumstance strong and convincing to my mind that President John-
</p>
<p>son's charge was totally false. It showed that Mr. Stanton had knowledge of the recom-
</p>
<p>mendation probably had examined the record in the four or five days which had inter-
</p>
<p>vened since the trial. As Secretary of War he was at that time daily almost hourly in
</p>
<p>1 consultation with the President over the disbandment of the military forces; the occupation
</p>
<p>by the army of the rebel States; the powers and duties of officers there, and the in-
</p>
<p>numerable questions semi-military in character arising out of the chaotic political and
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND JUDGE HOLT- 413
</p>
<p>social condition of the rebel States; and they could hardly have come together at that time
</p>
<p>without the question of the conviction and execution of the assassins coming up. The
</p>
<p>circumstances of the assassination, the plot or conspiracy to assassinate President Lincoln
</p>
<p>and his Cabinet, the Vice President himself, and General Grant; who were concerned
</p>
<p>in it; the evidence submitted to the Court, the weight given to it by the Court, and the
</p>
<p>conclusion reached by the Court, were matters in which the President and the Secretary
</p>
<p>of War could not fail to take, and, as is well known, did take the deepest possible interest.
</p>
<p>It is past human credulity to believe that they would thus come together during the time
</p>
<p>intervening between the conclusion of the trial on the 3Oth day of June and the execution
</p>
<p>of the sentences on the 7th of July, and the result of the trial, together with the recom-
</p>
<p>mendation to mercy, not be discussed between them. It is inconceivable to me that
</p>
<p>Judge Holt, even if he were so malicious and murderous in purpose, could be so reck-
</p>
<p>less and foolish in execution of such purpose as to withhold from and- try to conceal from
</p>
<p>President Johnson this recommendation to mercy, when the fact of its existence was
</p>
<p>known to Mr. Stanton, and was so certain to be made known to the President by him,
</p>
<p>and its contents discussed between them.
</p>
<p>The historian in passing judgment upon this event, and in weighing evidence as to
</p>
<p>the truth or falsity of this charge made by President Johnson, will take into considera-
</p>
<p>tion the mental characteristics and moral fibre of the two men, and what adequate
</p>
<p>motive there was actuating one occupying the exalted position of President Johnson to
</p>
<p>make the charge, or of Judge Holt to commit so wicked and cruel a wrong.
</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson's mental make-up is well known to the officers of the old Union
</p>
<p>army, and to the American people. His life, his acts, and his speeches are still remem-
</p>
<p>bered, and the public judgment formed and registered. I do not propose here to-night
</p>
<p>to take your time in going into a statement or discussion of this subject. It is sufficient
</p>
<p>to say that he was endowed by nature with more than ordinary intellectual abilities,
</p>
<p>and that he had risen from the lowest walks of life by the vigor ot his own will, energy,
</p>
<p>and mental power, through many intermediate places of honor and trust, to the second
</p>
<p>place in the gift of the American people theVice-Presidency of the United States.
</p>
<p>He was a man of controlling prejudices and strong personality. He was ambitious,
</p>
<p>bold, hot-tempered, obstinate, and in the achievement of the ends and aims he
</p>
<p>sought right ends and aims he may have thought them he was unscrupulous in the
</p>
<p>means he used. This is well illustrated in the instance given by General Sheridan in
</p>
<p>his memoirs of President Johnson's treatment of him while he was in command of New

<p>Orleans in 1866.
</p>
<p>You will recall the intense feeling aroused throughout the country by the wanton and
</p>
<p>bloody massacre of the convention assembled at New Orleans, on the 3Oth of July, that
</p>
<p>year, to remodel the constitution of that State. General Sheridan had been absent
</p>
<p>several days in Texas, and was returning, when the riot occurred. He reached New
</p>
<p>Orleans August ist, made an investigation, and on the same day sent the following
</p>
<p>telegraphic report to General Grant :
</p>
<p>" You are doubtless aware of the serious riot which occurred in this city on the 3Oth.
</p>
<p>Apolitical body styling themselves the 'Convention of 1864,' met on the 3Oth for, as it
</p>
<p>alleged, the purpose of remodeling the present constitution of the State. The leaders
</p>
<p>were political agitators and revolutionary men, and the action of the convention was
</p>
<p>liable to produce breaches of the public peace. I had made up my mind to arrest the
</p>
<p>head men if the proceedings of the convention were calculated to disturb the tranquility
</p>
<p>of the department, but I had no cause for action until they committed some overt act.
</p>
<p>41 4 THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
</p>
<p>In the meantime official duty called me to Texas, and the mayor of the city, during my
</p>
<p>absence, suppressed the convention by the use of the police force, and in so doing
</p>
<p>attacked the members of the convention and a party of two hundred negroes with fire-
</p>
<p>arms, clubs, and knives, in a manner so unnecessary and atrocious as to compel me to
</p>
<p>say that it was murder. About forty whites and blacks were thus killed, and about one
</p>
<p>hundred and sixty wounded. Everything is now quiet, but I deem it best to maintain
</p>
<p>a military supremacy in the city for a few days, until the affair is fully investigated. I
</p>
<p>believe the sentiment of the general community is great regret at this unnecessary
</p>
<p>cruelty, and that the police could have made any arrest they saw fit without sacrificing
</p>
<p>lives. "P. H. SHERIDAN,
</p>
<p>' ' Major General commanding. ' '
</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>General Sheridan adds: " On receiving the telegram, General Grant immediately
</p>
<p>submitted it to the President. Much clamor being made at the North for the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of the despatch, President Johnson pretended to give it to the newspapers. It
</p>
<p>appeared in the issues of August 4th, but with this paragraph omitted, viz. :
</p>
<p>" ' I had made up my mind to arrest the head men, if the proceedings were calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to disturb the tranquilly of the department, but I had no cause for action until
</p>
<p>they committed some overt act. In the meantime official duty called me to Texas, and
</p>
<p>the mayor of the city, during my absence, suppressed the convention by the use of the
</p>
<p>police force, and in so doing attacked the members of the convention and a party of two
</p>
<p>hundred negroes with fire-arms, clubs, and knives, in a manner so unnecessary and
</p>
<p>atrocious as to compel me to say it was murder.' "
</p>
<p>General Sheridan adds: "Against this garbling of my report, done by the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's own order, I strongly demurred, and this emphatic protest marks the beginning
</p>
<p>of Mr. Johnson's well-known personal hostility toward me."
</p>
<p>It will be observed that the omission of this portion of the despatch this "gar-
</p>
<p>bling," done by President Johnson's own order changes its whole tenor and meaning;
</p>
<p>made General Sheridan say exactly contrary to what he did in fact say. Omitting the
</p>
<p>part struck out, and connecting the two sentences that come together, the President
</p>
<p>made the despatch read: "The leaders were political agitators and revolutionary men,
</p>
<p>and the action of the convention was liable to produce breaches of the public peace.
</p>
<p>About forty whites and blacks were thus killed, and about one hundred and sixty
</p>
<p>wounded."

<p>Observe this makes General Sheridan say that the action of the convention was
</p>
<p>liable to produce breaches of the public peace, and thus, in this wise, about forty
</p>
<p>whites and blacks were killed and about one hundred and sixty wounded. General
</p>
<p>Sheridan said nothing of the kind nothing in the whole despatch had any such impli-
</p>
<p>cation or meaning. What he did say was that the mayor of the city " suppressed the
</p>
<p>convention by the use of the police force, and in so doing attacked the members of the
</p>
<p>convention and a party of two hundred negroes with fire-arms, clubs, and knives, in a

<p>manner so unnecessary and atrocious as to compel me to say that it was murder ' ' ; and
</p>
<p>"thus" by this means, by this mayor and his police, about forty whites and blacks
</p>
<p>were killed and about one hundred and sixty wounded.
</p>
<p>Is it too much to say that a man who could do this wrong to General Sheridan,
</p>
<p>could mutilate and corrupt a despatch so as to cause him to make a false report about a

<p>people over whom he was placed in government; to cause him to state falsely the facts

<p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON ND JUDGE HOLT. 415
</p>
<p>and circumstances about an event in which forty persons had lost their lives, and one
</p>
<p>hundred and sixty had been grievously wounded, would hesitate to state a falsehood
</p>
<p>about Judge Holt? Is it too much to say that a man who could do this, and then try
</p>
<p>to mislead and deceive the people of the United States as to this tragic event, about
</p>
<p>which they were clamoring to know the truth, perpetrating a lie upon them by mutilating
</p>
<p>and corrupting a despatch and promulgating it as the true one, would hesitate to deceive
</p>
<p>the people about the fact as to whether he did or did not see the recommendation to
</p>
<p>mercy of Mrs. Surratt ? Is it not fair to say that he was of such mental structure and
</p>
<p>moral fibre as to do this wrong?
</p>
<p>And now the motive:
</p>
<p>It is known of all men that Andrew Johnson had only fairly settled himself in the
</p>
<p>presidential chair of the great Lincoln, before he began to dream, to scheme, and to-
</p>
<p>intrigue for an election by the people to that office.
</p>
<p>The presidential bee was buzzing under the accidental presidential hat. The Southern
</p>
<p>leaders, clever diplomats and long-headed politicans as they are, soon took the measure
</p>
<p>of the man, and began to consider how best they could use him, and his ambition for their
</p>
<p>own purposes. It was noticed that Andrew Johnson had not been many months in the
</p>
<p>White House before there was a decided change in the style and type of visitors passing
</p>
<p>in and out under the great white portico. The men of the North, the old "Union
</p>
<p>Republican group " of the House and Senate that were daily visitors there in the days of
</p>
<p>Lincoln, began to find the atmosphere of the White House less kind and congenial; there
</p>
<p>was a lack of warmth in the welcome, and a constraint in talk and exchange of ideas,
</p>
<p>progressing gradually to actual antagonism over the questions of amnesty, reconstruc-
</p>
<p>tion, and constitutional guarantees to the freedmen. Then the Northern men dropped
</p>
<p>away; seemed not to go there any more. Men from the South who but lately had borne
</p>
<p>arms against the government, and who had not yet taken the oath of allegiance, were
</p>
<p>found plentiful about the White House, and apparently basking in the sunshine of presi-
</p>
<p>dential favor, as in the rays of a southern sun. It became the reign of the unreconstructed
</p>
<p>and unreconciled. Somebody had whispered loud enough for Mr. Johnson to hear,
</p>
<p>perhaps the bee buzzed it, that if the Southern States could be reconstructed previous to-
</p>
<p>the presidential convention of 1868, and he (President Johnson) should be found friendly
</p>
<p>and faithful to the South in that work, there were fifteen Southern States whose electoral
</p>
<p>votes might be found solid for him as the Democratic nominee, and he would only need
</p>
<p>the votes of two or three Northern States in addition to carry off the nomination. You

<p>know how the poison took how from the most radical of Union Republicans he be-
</p>
<p>came the most extreme the leader of the " strictest sect " of the Democrats; how the
</p>
<p>words " treason should be made odious," " traitors should take back seats," " a few trai-
</p>
<p>tors should be hung," with which his mouth was filled when elected, and were still sound-
</p>
<p>ing in the air when he sat down in Lincoln's vacant chair, had hardly died away before
</p>
<p>he had turned against and upon all those who had upheld the Union cause all his old
</p>
<p>Union friends; how he fought the Congress with a bitterness and a boldness unparalleled
</p>
<p>in history. He took issue with it on every measure by which the Congress sought to fix
</p>
<p>in statute and in the fundamental law what the sword had achieved, what war had
</p>
<p>enacted. Thus he stood.
</p>
<p>And now turning to Mrs. Surratt and her case. Over her execution a great clamor
</p>
<p>was raised throughout the country, not only by those who were lately in rebellion, and
</p>
<p>those in the North who were in sympathy with that rebellion, but almost universally
</p>
<p>by the Roman Catholics of the country, she being a member of that Church, they

</p>
<p>believing her innocent and a martyr. Mr. Johnson heard this clamor, and " his
</p>
<p>startled ambition grew sore afraid." He bethought him of some means to turn this
</p>
<p>wrath away from himself. The press kept referring to the fact that a recommendation
</p>
<p>to mercy had been signed by a majority of the Court ; and his new friends and allies
</p>
<p>were calling upon him with a loud voice to know why he had riot heeded the appeal
</p>
<p>for mercy, and saved this hapless woman. His fears whispered that the storm might
</p>
<p>grow so fierce and strong 'as to sweep away his carefully constructed political fabric.
</p>
<p>How could he turn away this wrath and clamor? How turn the fury of the storm?
</p>
<p>Were here not motive and interest enough? He doubtless remembered that, when he
</p>
<p>examined the record, he and Judge Holt had been alone. How easy to shift the blame,
</p>
<p>to turn the storm of wrath and execration upon another head by having it circulated
</p>
<p>that the recommendation had been suppressed by Judge Holt, and that he had never
</p>
<p>seen nor heard of it up to the time of the execution ! Here was a sufficient motive
</p>
<p>the motive of ambition the motive which, as we have seen, changed the whole nature
</p>
<p>of the man, - changed his political thought and attitude spoiled the purpose of his
</p>
<p>life.
</p>
<p>Of Judge Holt's life little need be said. Born and reared in Kentucky, of the best
</p>
<p>blood of the State, he had achieved fame and stood in the front rank with the great
</p>
<p>lawyers and orators of that State before the rebellion began, and before he was called to
</p>
<p>the Cabinet of James Buchanan, first, as Postmaster-General, and afterward as Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of War, to fill the place made vacant by the retirement of the traitor John B.
</p>
<p>Floyd. Judge Holt was a man of collegiate education, a student and a scholar of wide
</p>
<p>and varied reading, and a rhetorician and logician second to few men in the country.
</p>
<p>Of the next generation after Henry Clay, he was of the time and type in intellectual
</p>
<p>grasp and power of the Marshalls, the Breckinridges, and the Crittendens of that State.
</p>
<p>He breathed in the spirit of loyalty, patriotism, and love of the Union of Clay, and
</p>
<p>never doubted, never swerved in giving all his powers in dedicating his life to the
</p>
<p>work of saving the Union. It is related by the historian that at one of the Cabinet
</p>
<p>meetings of President Buchanan, when several of the Southern secretaries were still
</p>
<p>occupying their places and were boldly demanding that the forts at Charlestown should
</p>
<p>be evacuated, and Mr. Buchanan was too weak to take a position against them, Mr.
</p>
<p>Stanton, who had been called to fill the office of Attorney General, sprang to his feet
</p>
<p>and said, " Mr. President, it is my duty, as your legal adviser, to say that you have no
</p>
<p>right to give up the property of the government, or abandon the soldiers of the United

</p>
<p>States to its enemies, and the course proposed by the Secretary of the Interior, if fol-
</p>
<p>lowed, is treason, and will involve you and all concerned in treason! " For the first
</p>
<p>time in this Cabinet treason had been called by its true name. Floyd and Thompson,
</p>
<p>who had had everything their own way, sprang fiercely to their feet, while Mr. 'Holt sprang
</p>
<p>to Mr. Stanton's side, indorsing his utterances, and ready to uphold him in any struggle.
</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan begged that there would be no violence, and for the gentlemen to resume
</p>
<p>their seats. Thus bolstered by Mr. Stanton and Judge Holt, the President determined
</p>
<p>not to withdraw Major Anderson. Soon after this meeting, Floyd resigned, and Judge
</p>
<p>Holt was appointed Secretary of War in his place.
</p>
<p>Save this charge of Andrew Johnson, no stain or blot, nor the least spot or soilure,
</p>
<p>has ever rested on the fair name and fame of Joseph Holt. For the last year or two
</p>
<p>of the war I was brought in close official and personal relations with him. I learned to
</p>
<p>know him well. He was most refined and sensitive in his nature, gentle and kindly in
</p>
<p>his intercourse, and in all his relations with those about him, pure in his private life,
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND JUDGE HOLT. 417
</p>
<p>exalted in his ideas and ideals, dignified, and courtly in his bearing, yet always thought-
</p>
<p>ful, considerate, and courteous. He had traveled much, read much, and held as his
</p>
<p>friends, strongly attached to him, the best men of the land. I can now as little associate
</p>
<p>him in my mind with the commission of a dishonorable action as any man I have ever
</p>
<p>known.
</p>
<p>One of the interesting episodes connected with this charge against Judge Holt is his
</p>
<p>appeal to Mr. Speed, Mr. Lincoln's Attorney General, to " speak out " and state the
</p>
<p>fact whether or not the recommendation to mercy was before President Johnson and his
</p>
<p>Cabinet, and considered by them. The correspondence between Judge Holt and Mr.
</p>
<p>Speed is published in the North American Review for July, 1888. It will be remem-
</p>
<p>bered that Mr. Speed, in his letter to Judge Holt of March 30, 1873, had said:
</p>
<p>"After the finding of the military commission that tried the assassins of Mr. Lincoln,
</p>
<p>and before their execution, I saw the record of the case in the President's office, and
</p>
<p>attached to it was a paper, signed by some of the members of the commission, recom-
</p>
<p>mending that the sentence against Mrs. Surratt be commuted to imprisonment for life;
</p>
<p>and according to my memory the recommendation was made because of her sex."
</p>
<p>As I have heretofore said, this settled, so far as the testimony of James Speed could
</p>
<p>settle it, that the charge of Andrew Johnson that Judge Holt had withheld the
</p>
<p>recommendation to mercy was false. It settled the fact that previous to the execution
</p>
<p>the recommendation to mercy was in the President's office, and was attached to the
</p>
<p>record. But in this letter Mr. Speed added: " I do not feel at liberty to speak of what
</p>
<p>was said at Cabinet meetings. In this case I know I differ from other gentlemen, but
</p>
<p>feel constrained to follow my own sense of propriety."
</p>
<p>Judge Holt had learned, through the statements of Mr. Seward and Mr. Stanton to
</p>
<p>Judge Bingham, that the recommendation to mercy had been presented to the President,
</p>
<p>and had been considered by him and members of the Cabinet before the execution. But
</p>
<p>when this information came to him, both Mr. Seward and Mr. Stanton were dead, and
</p>
<p>the statement of Judge Bingham of what they told him was secondary evidence; and
</p>
<p>Judge Holt was anxious, therefore, to get the direct evidence of Mr. Speed that his
</p>
<p>recommendation was, to his personal knowledge, before Mr. Johnson and his Cabinet,
</p>
<p>and considered by them. His appeals to Mr. Speed are pathetic in the earnestness and
</p>
<p>depth of feeling they reveal. What could be more profoundly sorrowful or touching
</p>
<p>than this, in his letter of April 18, 1883 : " Allow me to add that we are now, each of us,
</p>
<p>far advanced in years, so that whatever is to be done for my relief should be done quickly.

</p>
<p>While, however, it is sadly apparent that I can remain here but a little while longer,
</p>
<p>I have not been able to bring myself to the belief that you will suffer the closing hours
</p>
<p>of my life to be darkened by a eonsciousness that this cloud, or even a shred of it, is
</p>
<p>still hanging over me a cloud which can be dissipated at once and forever by a single
</p>
<p>word spoken by yourself in defense of the truth and in rebuke of a calumny, the merci-
</p>
<p>less cruelty of which none can better understand than yourself. I make this final appeal
</p>
<p>to your honor as a man to do me the simple justice, which, under the same circum-
</p>
<p>stances, I would render to you at once and joyfully."
</p>
<p>But Mr. Speed would not speak finally saying, in his letter of October 25, 1883,
</p>
<p>"After very mature and deliberate consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I
</p>
<p>cannot say more than I have." Neither would he enter into consideration or discussion
</p>
<p>of his determination not "to speak of what was said at Cabinet meetings." It seems
</p>
<p>to me that Judge Holt was right and Mr. Speed was wrong in their relative positions
</p>
<p>upon this question. In his letter of April 18, 1883, addressed to Mr. Speed, to which
</p>
<p>41 8 THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN
</p>
<p>I have referred, Judge Holt forcibly presents his view: "You were a member of his
</p>
<p>(President Johnson's) Cabinet, and I have the strongest reasons for believing that this
</p>
<p>atrocious accusation is known to you to have been false in its every intendment. It
</p>
<p>originated with President Johnson, and for years was industriously circulated by his
</p>
<p>unscrupulous abettors, though he did not dare make open proclamation of it until he
</p>
<p>felt assured, through your letter of the 3Oth of March, 1873, that no damaging
</p>
<p>disclosures were to be apprehended from yourself. . . . The question whether a
</p>
<p>President of the United States, as a craven refuge from accountability for official action,
</p>
<p>did seek to blacken the reputation of a subordinate officer holding a confidential inter-
</p>
<p>view with him, is in no just sense a private question ; it is essentially a public one, which
</p>
<p>concerns the whole country, and one of which the country may well expect to speak,
</p>
<p>seeing that you were a member of that President's Cabinet, at the time of this disgrace-
</p>
<p>ful transaction. Your unwillingness thus to speak of it in 1873, seemed to have arisen
</p>
<p>from an exaggerated estimate of a rule which once prevailed with regard to the
</p>
<p>inviolability of Cabinet councils and secrets. But whatever may have been, in the
</p>
<p>remote past, the recognized force of this rule, the frequent and conspicuous disregard of
</p>
<p>it during the last two decades, by statesmen of the highest probity and rank, leaves the
</p>
<p>impression that the rule itself has lived its day and is now practically dead and
</p>
<p>inoperative. Waiving, however, this view, it is clear to me that, were the rule accepted
</p>
<p>as now binding in its utmost rigor, it could have no application to this case. I can not
</p>
<p>be misled in supposing that the relations between the President and the Cabinet are
</p>
<p>relations of honor, and that, therefore, they cannot be held to oblige any member of his
</p>
<p>Cabinet to protect, by his concealment, and thus become a moral accomplice in it
</p>
<p>any criminal or wrongful act into which the President may be drawn by a guilty
</p>
<p>ambition, or by any other unworthy passion or purpose. In a word, the rule never has
</p>
<p>been and never should be so construed as to become a shelter for perjury or crime.
</p>
<p>" Your associates in the Cabinet, Messrs Seward and Stanton, condemning the
</p>
<p>rule by which I have been so long victimized, declared the truth fully to Judge Bing-
</p>
<p>ham, as he has so forcibly set forth in his letter to which you are referred."
</p>
<p>But, as I have said, Mr. Speed would not speak. I can only account for it by the
</p>
<p>life, circumstances, and education of the man. In the old slave States, in the ante-
</p>
<p>bellum days, there existed many of the ideas, traditions, and rules of personal conduct of
</p>
<p>the feudal times. Things touching personal honor, or trusted to it, or that partook of
</p>
<p>the knightly and chivalrous, were esteemed above common right, common honesty, or

</p>
<p>common sense. Restrained by these limitations of birth and tradition, and controlled
</p>
<p>by his chivalrous idea of not revealing what he regarded as Cabinet secrets, Mr. Speed
</p>
<p>would not speak, even to save a public officer from a great wrong, or his personal friend
</p>
<p>from a calumny which he knew would walk beside him, shadowing and embittering a
</p>
<p>life, noble and void of wrong, down to its close. In this I think the judgment of man-
</p>
<p>kind will be that he erred. He knew that this charge of Andrew Johnson was a cruel
</p>
<p>falsehood. Not only what he said, but what he refused to say, proves this. His letter
</p>
<p>of March 30, 1873, states that he saw the record, with the recommendation attached to
</p>
<p>it, in the President's office before the execution. Judge Holt did not, therefore, " with-
</p>
<p>hold," as the President alleged. But, stronger than this, and conclusive, I believe, in
</p>
<p>the mind of every honest and unprejudiced man, were Mr. Speed's utterances, less than
</p>
<p>two years ago, at a meeting of the Loyal Legion at Cincinnati. Mr. Speed read a paper
</p>
<p>at the meeting of this society, held there on the 4th of May, 1887, in which he
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON AND JUDGE HOLT. 419
</p>
<p>" Only the group of fiends who stilled the pulsations of Lincoln's great heart, paid
</p>
<p>the penalty of the crime. A maudlin sentiment has sought to cast blame on the officials
</p>
<p>who dealt out justice to these. One in particular is my distinguished friend, the then
</p>
<p>Judge Advocate General of the army. Judge Holt performed his duty kindly and con-
</p>
<p>siderately. In every particular he was just and fair. This I know; but Judge Holt
</p>
<p>needs no vindication from me nor any one else. I only speak because I know reflec-
</p>
<p>tions have been made, and because my position enabled me to know the facts, and
</p>
<p>because I know the perfect purity and uprightness of his conduct." Could any words
</p>
<p>say in stronger form, he knew that in this matter Judge Holt did his whole duty, and
</p>
<p>that President's Johnson's charges were false? Could he have said, " In every par-
</p>
<p>ticular he was just and fair, this I know," if he did not know and intended to say that
</p>
<p>he knew Judge Holt did his whole duty and had presented this recommendation to
</p>
<p>mercy to President Johnson? But what he refused to say is as strongly convincing to
</p>
<p>my mind of the fact that the recommendation to mercy was, to his knowledge, duly
</p>
<p>brought to the President's attention, and was read and considered by him and members
</p>
<p>of his Cabinet, as anything he has affirmatively stated.
</p>
<p>He was asked by Judge Holt to state whether this paper was or was not before
</p>
<p>President Johnson and his Cabinet. He refused to answer " because he did not feel at
</p>
<p>liberty to speak of what was said at Cabinet meetings." If nothing was said about
</p>
<p>the recommendation, if no such paper ever came before the Cabinet, might he not have
</p>
<p>so stated; might he not have said, "No such matter ever came before the Cabinet? "
</p>
<p>This would not reveal any Cabinet secret, would come nowhere near the limitations he
</p>
<p>had prescribed for himself " not to speak of what was said at Cabinet meetings.' 1
</p>
<p>Is it not the inevitable logical conclusion that it was because of this knowledge
</p>
<p>that this recommendation had been before, and had been discussed by, the President and
</p>
<p>his Cabinet, and his determination " not to speak of what was said at Cabinet meet-
</p>
<p>ings," that he would not speak?
</p>
<p>But, finally, my friends, has not the faith of Judge Holt been realized?- Has not
</p>
<p>time caused the truth to shine forth and his innocence to appear? In 1873, he said:
</p>
<p>"An abiding faith, however, remains with me that the public will do these witnesses
</p>
<p>justice, and myself, also; and that if truth has power to disarm the cloud of calumny
</p>
<p>of its lightnings, that then, standing in their presence and under their shelter, I may
</p>
<p>well feel that for the future this cloud can have no terrors for me."
