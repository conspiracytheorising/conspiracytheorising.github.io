<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>This is the fourth of a series of pamphlets that have been devoted to
</p>
<p>the affairs of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad Company. All of them
</p>
<p>have been written with a purpose.
</p>
<p>The rst was entitled  Minority Rights and Corporate Methods;
</p>
<p>as illustrated in the? action of the Trustee-Directors and Director-
</p>
<p>Trustees of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad Company. By a Mere
</p>
<p>Anonymous Newspaper Scribbler. This contained the letters origi-
</p>
<p>nally printed in the Railroad Recora of Philadelphia, under the signature
</p>
<p>of An Old Subscriber, and referred to by Judge Drake in one of his
</p>
<p>letters with an intimation that he had read them. They were reprinted
</p>
<p>in this form for the convenience of the Directors, and forwarded to
</p>
<p>each one of them in season to be read before the meeting of stock-
</p>
<p>holders on June 2t, 1886. It seems to have been the purpose of
</p>
<p>the writer to give them no excuse for not comprehending perfectly the
</p>
<p>eect of the resolution of 12th of May, and ample opportunity of
</p>
<p>amending the same so as to divest it of its odious features. It was also
</p>
<p>, distributed among a few persons interested in the property, and re-
</p>
<p>sulted in the combination of the twelve common stockholders for the
</p>
<p>purpose of defeating that resolution by a protest.
</p>
<p>The second pamphlet was entitled Crooked By-Ways and Slip-
</p>
<p>pery High-Ways traversed by the Directors of the St. Paul and Duluth
</p>
<p>Railroad Company, Trustee. By a Common Stockholder. The object
</p>
<p>of it was to preserve in a form for convenient reference, the plan of
</p>
<p>sale, purchase and reorganization; and the opinion of Judge Drake that
</p>
<p>the plan was very strong in securing seven (7) per cent. forever to the
</p>
<p>preferred stockholders, but that it was  fatally defective as to secur-
</p>
<p>- ing the common stockholders any consideration for this perpetual
</p>
<p>source of enjoyment. The pamphlet also contained the protests of

</p>
<p>the common stockholders made at the annual meeting of June 2 I, I 886,
</p>
<p>with the account of it by the Management in the Razlroaa7 Record, and
</p>
<p>their explanation of the reasons why the common stockholders could not
</p>
<p>be paid a dividend this year. It also contained a series of letters from a t
</p>
<p>gentleman of Brooklyn which had appeared in the Wall Street Daz'gl ~

</p>
<p>News at intervals during the previous twelvemonth. The pamphlet
</p>
<p>was sent to all the Directors, and to such members of the gradually
</p>
<p>increasing circle of protestants as were sufciently interested to seek
</p>
<p>information.
</p>
<p>The third pamphlet was entitled The Rights and Wrongs of
</p>
<p>Helpless Stockholders, and of a Helpless Corporation. Bya Layman. 
</p>
<p>This furnished, from authentic sources, proofs as to the condition of the
</p>
<p>railroad for  many years afterits reorganization, and of its absolutely
</p>
<p>impecunious condition at the time it reissued as net prots the realized
</p>
<p>income  of cancelled preferred stock. It contains also an important
</p>
<p>portion of the charter, which provides that the preferred stock con-
</p>
<p>verted into lands shall never be reconverted into voting stock. It
</p>
<p>shows more in detail than its predecessor pamphlet, the motives with
</p>
<p>which the bamboozling resolution had been framed, and the assurance
</p>
<p>of advantage with which it was urged by the Trustees on the common
</p>
<p>class of their beneciaries. Of this pamphlet also only a few copies
</p>
<p>were circulated outside of the then very considerable number of pro-
</p>
<p>testants.
</p>
<p>A careful perusal by the common stockholders of the answer of
</p>
<p>the Corporation to the second bill of Mr. Baring-Wells, in connection
</p>
<p>with the statement of facts presented in the following pages, will con-
</p>
<p>vince them it is not to [hair funeral the stockholders are invited on the
</p>
<p>20th of June.
</p>
<p>No person can be compelled, and no person is invited, to read
</p>
<p>this pamphlet; and yet it can be easily calculated how much the
</p>
<p>protestants who read the former pamphlets on this subject have
</p>
<p>proted by information which they could have derived from no other
</p>
<p>source. With them it makes all the difference between buying the
</p>
<p>common stock at under fty, and buying it at over ninety. It some-
</p>
<p>times pays to read, for a little knowledge is oftentimes a great advan-
</p>
<p>tage. The following pages show the owners how near they came to
</p>
<p>being stripped of the property; and shows the lien-holders that it is not
</p>
<p>possible for them any longer to evade, pervert, or defeat the execution
</p>
<p>of the trust. The common stockholders have waked up, and the
</p>
<p>corporation defendant is in the grip of the law.

<p>NEW YORK, June 10, 1887. A LAYMAN.
</p>
<p>,TO WHOM SHALL WE SEND OUR PROXIES?
</p>
<p>L-A
</p>
<p>v'i
</p>
<p>IT is my purpose in the following pages to communicate
</p>
<p>to the stockholders of the St. Paul and, Duluth Railroad
</p>
<p>Company, the views of a common stockholder as to the
</p>
<p>rights and relations of the two classes of stock to the Cor-
</p>
<p>poration, in the light of the answer of the Corporation to
</p>
<p>the second complaint of Mr. Baring-Tells, and the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions adopted by the Directors on the 5th of February, and
</p>
<p>published for the rst time on or about the 14th of May.
</p>
<p>I have before me a certied copy of the answer as it was
</p>
<p>led in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Dis-
</p>
<p>trict of Minnesota. It is a voluminous document of some
</p>
<p>sixty-four pages of foolscap, and with some aid from other
</p>
<p>sources of information I propose to consider the history
</p>
<p>furnished by the Corporation itself of the methods it has
</p>
<p>adopted in the execution. of an important trust of which the
</p>
<p>plaintiff is a beneciary. I wish to present the facts of the
</p>
<p>case in statements so perfectly well authenticated by the
</p>
<p>Corporation and the Management, as to enable preferred as
</p>
<p>well as common stockholders to decide intelligently as to
</p>
<p>the disposition to be made of their proxies with reference to
</p>
<p>the important questions that will come before the Company
</p>
<p>at its annual meeting at St. Paul on the 20th of June.
</p>
<p>It seems that Mr. Baring-Wells is the owner of twelve
</p>
<p>hundred shares of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad, which
</p>
<p>he purchased at different periods between 188i and 1886.
</p>
<p>He does not state at what price he purchased, nor is it at
</p>
<p>all material to his rights in the premises, but we may
</p>

</p>
<p>assume that the sworn answer of the Corporation is true,
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>and that he must have bought all his stock at prices varying
</p>
<p>from $3 5 to $60 a share. The Corporation swears that his
</p>
<p>stock is now worth a great deal more than that, and as
</p>
<p>much as $69.88 a share in the market, and thinks that ought
</p>
<p>to satisfy him. This argument of a trustee-defendant in
</p>
<p>equity to establish a right to rob a beneciary of his prop-
</p>
<p>erty, on the ground that he has made about as much money
</p>
<p>as is good for him, is perhaps one of the most extraordinary
</p>
<p>arguments ever made in a court of justice. It is not unlikely
</p>
<p>that I may have occasion to refer again to this point before
</p>
<p>I get through, but I cannot interrupt the thread of my
</p>
<p>narrative by more than this passing allusion to it.
</p>
<p>These twelve hundred shares thus acquired, as the
</p>
<p>Corporation says at a cost of only $47,000, Mr. Baring-
</p>
<p>VVells has held as an investment for the time stated in his
</p>
<p>complaint, never selling the same, nor dealing or trading in
</p>
<p>the stock, but simply holding it as an investment on which
</p>
<p>he was looking for all the returns to which he might be-
</p>
<p>come lawfully entitled. He gave about the same attention
</p>
<p>to the subject as the average stockholder gives to the affairs
</p>
<p>of a company in which he has a large interest. He looked
</p>
<p>occasionally at the stock list perhaps, and he read the
</p>
<p>annual reports, and being a good easy soul no doubt (for
</p>
<p>he never took the trouble to register his stock), he was
</p>
<p>satisfied with the progress reported and the occasional
</p>
<p>intimations in the newspapers about dividend time that
</p>
<p>some percentage had been earned on the common stock,
</p>
<p>and that a dividend might be looked for with condence at
</p>
<p>an early day. This thing repeated every six months got at
</p>
<p>last to be a little monotonous. He saw that the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders had helped themselves to $820,000 in preferred
</p>
<p>stock, and were getting their three and a half per cent.
</p>
<p>semi-annually on the 1st of July and the Ist of January in each
</p>
<p>year, but the six per cent. dividend on the common stock
</p>
<p>was every time put off to the next year. Then came 1884,

</p>
<p>and the Directors promised that as soon as the receipts in-
</p>
<p>creased a little more they would pay a dividend on the
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>common stock, sure. The receipts increased in a geomet-
</p>
<p>rical ratio, as one of their patent book-keeping Directors
</p>
<p>described it. But the more the receipts increased the farther
</p>
<p>dff was dividend day postponed. The methods of keeping
</p>
<p>the accounts were changed, under the fallacious idea that it
</p>
<p>was possible to change the actual results of the business by
</p>
<p>changing the methods of stating them.
</p>
<p>Before the year 1885, the actual operating expenses, and
</p>
<p>those only, were deducted from the gross earnings, in order
</p>
<p>to ascertain the net earnings from which the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders were to be paid their dividends. There was
</p>
<p>no honest reason for changing this method. In view of the
</p>
<p>contract existing between the three parties to the plan of re-
</p>
<p>organization, it was the only lawful and regular method. It
</p>
<p>is the mode adopted by the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States, and sanctioned by the Courts of the United States
</p>
<p>in the adjustment of the relations of the Government to the
</p>
<p>railroads in which it is interested. This was testied to by
</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Francis Adams in his recent examination before
</p>
<p>the Railroad Commissioners. This was the course always
</p>
<p>pursued by the preferred stockholders as long as it was
</p>
<p>essential to nding net earnings for their dividends. But
</p>
<p>the moment the net earnings showed a balance for the
</p>
<p>common stockholders, then the method of bookkeeping was
</p>
<p>changed, for the obviously fraudulent purpose of depriving
</p>
<p>the common stockholders of the dividends intended to be
</p>
<p>secured to them by the plan, and for no other purpose, and
</p>
<p>with no authority whatever from the stockholders. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, in 1884 the stockholders adopted a resolution to
</p>
<p>the effect that  thereafter the net cash income of the Com
</p>
<p>pany from all sources, shall be sez apart and applied rst to
</p>
<p>the payment of dividends in car/z, in accordance with the
</p>
<p>plan of reorganization, before being used for improvements
</p>
<p>or additions to the road or equipment. In 1885 the annual
</p>
<p>report states the amount applicable to dividends at $765,
</p>

</p>
<p>377.97. The report of 1886 states the  net earnings from the
</p>
<p>operation of the road $630,790.61. This sum is more than
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>sufcient to pay the 7 per cent. on the preferred stock and
</p>
<p>6 per cent. on the common stock, with a tidy balance in
</p>
<p>favor of the Corporation. But the new system of book-
</p>
<p>keeping, devised for the purposes to which I have referred
</p>
<p>above, which I may style the book-keeping 0f the Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia branch ofce, gures out on the yearly transactions
</p>
<p>a decit of railroad earnings of $145295 5. The manage-
</p>
<p>ment therefore have jockeyed the common stockholders by
</p>
<p>at/z methods of book-keeping. Under the old system they
</p>
<p>made the net earnings larger than they ought to have been
</p>
<p>in order to devise an excuse for paying the preferred stock-
</p>
<p>holders unearned dividends for cancelled stock; under the
</p>
<p>new system they annihilate the net earnings altogether, as
</p>
<p>an excuse for withholding from the common stockholders
</p>
<p>dividends that have been actually earned. '
</p>
<p>An anecdote that has come down to us from war times
</p>
<p>illustrates the situation. It was in the days of the Income
</p>
<p>Tax. A well known merchant went before the Internal
</p>
<p>Revenue Collector and swore down the net income of his
</p>
<p>business to a thousand dollars. He was willing to pay the
</p>
<p>tax on that, but the grocery business had been very bad,
</p>
<p>and really he had actually lost money on the years transac-
</p>
<p>tions. Are you quite sure of this? was the inquiry.
</p>
<p> C) yes; I will take my oath of it.  Then, how happens
</p>
<p>it that your head clerk reports the income from your busi-
</p>
<p>ness at $40,000? Why, was the answer, that is be-
</p>
<p>cause he does not know how to keep the books.  How
</p>
<p>so?  He omits the expenses of the business, the simpleton.
</p>
<p>The expenses to offset the prots were $50,000, and I lose
</p>
<p>that much money. On being pressed for an explanation,
</p>
<p>he said that his business had increased so much, and had'to
</p>
<p>be done on such a small margin of prots, that he was com-
</p>
<p>pelled to buy the adjacent store, and paying for it had
</p>
<p>diminished his prots to such an extent that he was actually
</p>
<p>$10,000 in debt.

<p>It is needless to say that the tax-gatherer did not see it
</p>
<p>in the same light, and gured on his income, including what .'
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>had been expended on the store. The grocer had to pay
</p>
<p>the bill, but he discharged his head clerk and swore that he
</p>
<p>wpuld keep his own books for the future, and that if any
</p>
<p>in; ernal taxgatherer got the better of him again he'd know
</p>
<p>it. Thereafter he kept his accounts in his head or in his
</p>
<p>hatand this method we recommend to all corporations
</p>
<p>that nd it necessary to swear that they are minus $14,529. 5 5
</p>
<p>on net earnings  reported ofcially at $630,970.61.
</p>
<p>This withholding of dividends from the common stock
</p>
<p>in' spite of the increased earnings, and this extraordinary
</p>
<p>change in the methods of book-keeping excited Mr. Baring-
</p>
<p>WIells suspicions, and he became a little uneasy. But in
</p>
<p>the early part of 1886 he obtained information direct from
</p>
<p>the Philadelphia branch ofce that President Fisher had
</p>
<p>telegraphed to the Vice-President that if he could have the
</p>
<p>proceeds of the lands and stumpage to apply to improve-
</p>
<p>ments, he could pay a dividend of six per cent. on the com-
</p>
<p>mon stock. It must have been on this very gratifying as
</p>
<p>surance that Mr. Baring-Wells added to his common stock
</p>
<p>by the purchase of a hundred shares at sixty.
</p>
<p>Whatever may have been his hopes of nding an honest
</p>
<p>interval in the proceedings of the Management, they were
</p>
<p>rudely dispelled on the appearance of the insidious resolu-
</p>
<p>tion recommended by the Directors on the 12th of May,
</p>
<p>1886. That resolution could mean nothing but fraud, con-
</p>
<p>cealed in the most specious and cunnineg devised terms.
</p>
<p>It is not my purpose to enter again into the discussion of
</p>
<p>the bamboozling resolution. In a previous pamphlet* I
</p>
<p>have exposed 1t so fully that there is nothing further to
</p>
<p>add, and with a completeness of proof that renders denial
</p>
<p>or explanation impossible. When that resolution was thus
</p>
<p>recommended, Mr. Baring-Wells saw that its passage would
</p>
<p>be fatal to the interests of the common stockholders; that it
</p>
<p>broke up the trust entirely; that it established the preferred
</p>
<p>stock as ownership stock with its triple vote in perpetua;

<p>that it gave complete power over accruing funds from ll
</p>
<p>sources to Directors elected by the preferred stockhold rs
</p>
<p>alone, and to men who had already invested four millions
</p>
<p>of dollars in the Corporation from funds furnished exclu-
</p>
<p>sively by the common stockholders, without giving them
</p>
<p>one dollar to represent the money due them in divi-
</p>
<p>dends, or without withdrawing by the application of the
</p>
<p>annual surpluses any portion of the preferred stock.
</p>
<p>Before the issue of this resolution, he knew that a dis-
</p>
<p>cussion had been going on in the Railroad Record, of Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, in which it had been substantially preshadowed;
</p>
<p>and that in the course of this discussion, articles publicly
</p>
<p>attributed to two very prominent Eastern Directors, and
</p>
<p>never disavowed by them, had denied the power of the
</p>
<p>Corporation to carry out the plan of reorganization; had
</p>
<p>repeatedly asserted that the plan could not and would not
</p>
<p>be carried out; that it was fatally defective; and that there
</p>
<p>was no method by which the holders of the preferred stock
</p>
<p>could be compelled to submit to its withdrawal and cancel-
</p>
<p>lation, notwithstanding the express stipulation engraved
</p>
<p>upon every certicate.
</p>
<p>When therefore the resolution appeared, he recognized
</p>
<p>it at once as an attempt to give power and vitality to the
</p>
<p>policy developed in the Record, and to deliver the owners
</p>
<p>of the property, stripped and bound, into the hands of the
</p>
<p>holders of the lien. He saw that propositions contemplat-
</p>
<p>ing the results which that resolution would inevitably
</p>
<p>bring about could not be otherwise than fraudulent, and
</p>
<p>he went to the annual meeting of stockholders of the 20th
</p>
<p>June and joined in the protest against its passage. Fortu-
</p>
<p>nately for the common stockholders Mr. James J -. Hill was
</p>
<p>present with his counsel, Judge Clark, by his side; the
</p>
<p>protest answered its purpose, and the contemplated spolia-
</p>
<p>tion of the common stockholders was postponed to the
</p>
<p>next annual meeting. The Management, somewhat crest-

</p>
<p>fallen, returned to Philadelphia and assuaged their wounded
</p>
<p>feelings by announcing through their private organ, the
</p>
<p>it
</p>
<p>Razllroaa Record, that there could be no dividends paid upon
</p>
<p>thecommon stock at present, adding with their usual scru-
</p>
<p>puljous regard to truth:  For this result the common stock-
</p>
<p>ho tders desiring dividends will have to thank Mr. Sargent
</p>
<p>an his eleven associates, represented by his attorney, Mr.
</p>
<p>Hahn, and holding 3,644 shares out of a total of 94,323
</p>
<p>shares. Then they relieved what purported to be their
</p>
<p> minds  by some chaff, borrowed of the street gamz'ns,
</p>
<p>about the  tail wagging the dog, and about Mr. Sargent's
</p>
<p>protest not being intelligible, as if he were responsible
</p>
<p>for their inability to understand. With a years study, per-
</p>
<p>haps they will comprehend it by the 20th of the present
</p>
<p>June.
</p>
<p>But it was of the intrepretation of the plan that I was
</p>
<p>speaking, and in connection with the effort that has been
</p>
<p> made during the past twelve months to create the impres-
</p>
<p>sion that the preferred stock could not be retired, and to
</p>
<p>lead holders to object to being retired, and the opinion of a
</p>
<p>distinguished jurist that the contract could not be enforced.
</p>
<p>All this nonsense has been eliminated from the discussion by
</p>
<p>the averments of the answer, that will prove a veritable eye-
</p>
<p>opener to recalcitrant holders like the Boston correspond-
</p>
<p>ent of the Wall Szreez. Daily News who signs himself Jus-
</p>
<p>tice, and says that the common stockholders are a set of
</p>
<p> Shylocks  for standing on the ne edge of their agree-
</p>
<p>ment. Yes, thats just where they stand and propose to
</p>
<p>remain. And now let us see what the answer says about it:
</p>
<p>These defendants aver that each and every allegation charging
</p>
<p>or imputing fraud or bad faith, or any intent to evade, pervert or defeat
</p>
<p>the provisions of said plan of sale, purchase and reorganization, or to
</p>
<p>sacrice the interests of the plaintiff or any holder of the common
</p>
<p>stock, or the adoption of any policy to that end; or any acts in that
</p>
<p>behalf on the part of or by the Directors of said Corporation, or any of
</p>
<p>them, or any Board of Directors of said Corporation, or any of its of-
</p>
<p>cers, are untrue.

</p>
<p> And these defendants aver that the policy of said Directors and its
</p>
<p>ofcers, and each and every of them has always been and now is, to
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>carry out the terms of said plan of sale, purchase and reorganizzaijion,
</p>
<p>and to retire saz'd prqerred siock as rapidly as zlze same could or c be

</p>
<p>ses, and the preservation of the property to the! end; and have never/zed
</p>
<p>any ollzer or dz'erent policy. 
</p>
<p>This is pretty hard swearing even for a Corporation, that
</p>
<p>swears only by its seal. But it is extremely gratifying to
</p>
<p>know that it now swears to the validity of a plan that pro-
</p>
<p>vides for the retirement of the preferred stock; swears that
</p>
<p>the retirement is practicable; and swears that the Corpora-
</p>
<p>tion will not seek to evade or defeat the retirement, but, on
</p>
<p>the contrary, will make it as rapidly as it can, consistently
</p>
<p>with the public good. In view of all this swearing, what
</p>
<p>becomes of the repeated, persistent and unwarrantable
</p>
<p>efforts of the Eastern Directors, acting under the inspira-
</p>
<p>tions of the Philadelphia branch ofce, to create the impres-
</p>
<p>sion that the preferred stock could not be retired?
</p>
<p>They began this creditable work on the 23d of January,
</p>
<p>1886, when they announced in the Railroad Record that the
</p>
<p>operation of sinking funds  applies so peculiarly to bonds
</p>
<p>that it would seem to be impracticable with stock, and
</p>
<p>that therefore it was not unlikely that the stockholders  at
</p>
<p>their next or some future meeting, would authorize the pur-
</p>
<p>chase of preferred stock for cancellation at market prices
</p>
<p>instead of drawing it at par.
</p>
<p>A fortnight afterwards they circulated through the same
</p>
<p>channel a statement that the provisions for drawing the
</p>
<p>shares of preferred stock are so  defective as to be imprac-
</p>
<p>ticable, and that there is no provision compelling share-
</p>
<p>holders to relinquish their shares if drawn.
</p>
<p>Towards the close of February they broached tenta-
</p>
<p>tively the scheme for voting themselves three-fths of the
</p>
<p>property in the most artless and guileless manner possible,
</p>
<p>as if it were a happy thought just struck out in the warmth
</p>
<p>of discussion. Then it was that they rst suggested a

</p>
<p>change of the provision for the purchase and cancellation
</p>
<p>of preferred stock, and recommended that when the land-
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>grant money should not be required to pay the dividend
</p>
<p>on the preferred stock (this was something they never lost
</p>
<p>sight of), it should constitute  a fund for improvements and
</p>
<p>additions. Then, in a sort of by-the-way manner they
</p>
<p>add: Indeed, why should not the stockholders agree that
</p>
<p>after the 7 per cent. is paid on preferred stock the same
</p>
<p>shall also be paid on the common when earned, any excess
</p>
<p>of income after that to be divided equally between both
</p>
<p>preferred and common stock.
</p>
<p>A bright idea, accidentally suggesting itself as a capital
</p>
<p>thing, very much to the advantage of both classes of stock;
</p>
<p>it was so perfectly reasonable to provide for the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders, in view of their chronic liberality. In order
</p>
<p>to make this more acceptable, and more evidently and ab-
</p>
<p>solutely the proper thing to do, the good Eastern Directors
</p>
<p>add: As before stated in these columns, the common
</p>
<p>stockholders have received the benet of the expenditures
</p>
<p>upon the property, in its greatly enhanced intrinsic value
</p>
<p>and productive power, WITHOUT HAVING CONTRIBUTED A
</p>
<p>DOLLAR TOWARDS 1r. .
</p>
<p>No. The preferred stockholders were the fellows who
</p>
<p>did the contributing, but the contents of their contribu-
</p>
<p>tion box they divided among themselves. To their own
</p>
<p>strong box they contributed certicates that had been
</p>
<p>retired and cancelled t0 the amount of $820,000, to which
</p>
<p>they had no more legal, equitable or moral right than they
</p>
<p>had to the private pocket-book of the common stockholder.
</p>
<p>Cash dividends to the amount of 7 per cent. annually had
</p>
<p>also been declared for the preferred stockholders and paid
</p>
<p>.to them. But the common stockholders it seems in Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, 1886, had not contributed a single dollar towards the
</p>
<p>expenditures of the Company. The preferred stockholders,
</p>
<p>the lien-holders, had contributed all, and the pauper owners
</p>
<p>Of the property had done nothing at all towards its improve-
</p>
<p>ments. How is this?

<p>Taylors Fall branch of 21 miles, the whole of which is now

</p>
<p>There had been at least three and a half millions of

<p>dollars contributed to the property by the common stock-

<p>ommending the spoliation of these owners, declared that
</p>
<p>they had never contributed a dollar towards zlze improvement
</p>
<p>of tire properly.
</p>
<p>This, however, is merely a remark in passing. Let me
</p>
<p>resume the narrative. In their manifesto of the 9th of
</p>
<p>March, in the Record, the Management admit, with reference
</p>
<p>to a stock dividend, that the common stockholders are
</p>
<p>clearly entitled to one, on the same ground on which a
</p>
<p>stock dividend was paid to the preferred stockholders.

</p>
<p>The precedent, they say, has been established, and it
</p>
<p>may doubtless be settled in the same way. But still they
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>put forward in a gingerly style their half-matured scheme
</p>
<p>for  evading the provisions of the plan and preventing the
</p>
<p>retirement of the preferred stock, which the corporation
</p>
<p>now swears was something they never contemplated for one
</p>
<p>moment. After advising the inquiring stockholder to
</p>
<p>possess his soul in peace (that being the only possession
</p>
<p>they intended to leave him), they say that it is useless to
</p>
<p>seek to make any conict between the two classes of stock-
</p>
<p>holders, adding oracularly: Such advantageous modica-
</p>
<p>tions of the reorganization plan as they have the power to
</p>
<p>make, will doubtless be considered by them in the same
</p>
<p>harmonious spirit as has heretofore characterized all their
</p>
<p>action, and secured such substantial results for the Com-
</p>
<p>panyf
</p>
<p>The secret of this wonderful harmony is explained by
</p>
<p>the statement of the Management that the Directors chosen
</p>
<p>in 1885, and for several years previous, directly represented
</p>
<p>and controlled considerably more than one-half of the entire
</p>
<p>common stock of the Company. It followed that the two
</p>
<p>classes of stock  were too largely in the hands of the same
</p>
<p>holders, to suppose that there could be any conflict of
</p>
<p>interest. This is a perfect explanation of the wonderful
</p>
<p>unanimity with which everything was done for a con-
</p>
<p>siderable series of years. Peters common stock was not
</p>
<p>going to vote against a dividend on his preferred stock, and
</p>
<p>as long as all the money that came in was only enough to
</p>
<p>pay dividends on his preferred stock, Peter could use his
</p>
<p>common stock to sell out at high prices on the promise of
</p>
<p>dividends, and buy in at low prices when the promises were
</p>
<p>found to be fallacious.
</p>
<p>Thus we see how a large majority of stockholders of
</p>
<p>both classes were always represented at the annual meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and how unanimously they might agree to vote every-
</p>
<p>thing that the Management desired. Peter, indeed, as a
</p>
<p>preferred stockholder could swindle Peter as a common

</p>
<p>stockholder without feeling it; but the moment Peter the
</p>
<p>preferred stockholder had to deal with Paul as a common
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>stockholder, it is surprising how much discord and unhap-
</p>
<p>piness Paul introduced into this unanimous and harmonious
</p>
<p>family. It became a regular dog ght, and the gOOd
</p>
<p>Directors brought things to such a pass that when there
</p>
<p>seemed to be really only one dog left, his tail wagged him.
</p>
<p>That phenomenon was actually materialized at the annual
</p>
<p>meeting of June, 1886, and is avouched in print by the good
</p>
<p>Directors.
</p>
<p>But I must not digress from my immediate object. I
</p>
<p>think it has been made sufciently clear how the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders were able to manage everything without a dis-
</p>
<p>senting voice. Outside of the inside ring who owned the
</p>
<p>preferred all the time, and owned the common Sometimes,
</p>
<p>the common stockholders knew little or nothing about the
</p>
<p>property, supposed it to be of little value, had no organiza-
</p>
<p>tion to look after interests that in many cases were small
</p>
<p>and very widely distributed, and the Directors had every-
</p>
<p>thing their own way, doing what they pleased in their
</p>
<p>capacity of Directors and then ratifying everything in their
</p>
<p>capacity of stockholders. The rst time that there was
</p>
<p>ever any intelligent and combined action of common. stock-
</p>
<p>holders to look after their rights and interests, was at the
</p>
<p>meeting of June, 1886, and even then the old tradition that
</p>
<p>the interests of the two classes of stockholders were the
</p>
<p>same, induced a good many ill-informed,or uninformed stock-
</p>
<p>holders to send their proxies to the men who were pledged
</p>
<p>to betray them.
</p>
<p>In the Record of March 24th, the Management ventilated
</p>
<p>their proposed changes of plan. Then they boasted of
</p>
<p>having a" valuable opinion, from an eminent legal au-
</p>
<p>thority, from Which it appeared perfectly clear that the
</p>
<p>plan might be altered by the stockholders, if the alteration
</p>
<p>did not impair vested rights, and that no vested rights
</p>
<p>would be impaired by suspending the purchase of pre-
</p>
<p>ferred stock when above par, and using the stumpage money

</p>
<p>and land receipts in necessary improvements and additions
</p>
<p>to the property. This course the Management highly ap.
</p>
<p>1/: '
</p>
<p>proved, and more particularly because it would enable the
</p>
<p>stockholders  to carry out the suggestion of paying seven
</p>
<p>per cent. on the preferred stock and seven per cent. on the
</p>
<p>common, and dividing the excess on both classes of stock
</p>
<p>alike.
</p>
<p>For example, if there should be a hundred thousand dol-
</p>
<p>lars excess, which the plan required to be used in extin-
</p>
<p>guishing the preferred stock, the whole benet of which ac-
</p>
<p>crued to the common stockholders, it would impair no
</p>
<p> vested rights  for the preferred stockholders to vote
</p>
<p>themselves $60,000 of it and leave the owners of the prop-
</p>
<p>erty $40,000.
</p>
<p>The Management in the same manifesto expressed the
</p>
<p>opinion that if they could only get this stumpage money,
</p>
<p>and liberty to sell the two million of common stock in the
</p>
<p>treasury at par or upwards, and use that too for improve-
</p>
<p>ments, then it would require only a small increase of
</p>
<p>earnings to insure six per cent. on the common in the ensu_
</p>
<p>ing scal year. Yes, all the stumpage money so appro-
</p>
<p>priated as to render the retirement of the preferred stock
</p>
<p>impossible, and the common stock in the treasury ap-i
</p>
<p>propriated to the uses of the Corporation, the preferred
</p>
<p>i Would indeed have risen to the character of a permanent
</p>
<p>seven per cent. stOck, and the  eminent legal authority
</p>
<p>would have secured a vested right  beyond all peradven-
</p>
<p>ture.
</p>
<p>In-April the Management ventured on a fuller exposition
</p>
<p>of their views. No member of the Board, they swear in
</p>
<p>their recent answer, ever thought for a moment of evad-
</p>
<p>ing, or defeating  the plan, or ever made any sort of a
</p>
<p> threat  contemplating anything of the kind,or even squint-
</p>
<p>ing in that direction. By this timeit was in the genial April
</p>
<p>daysthe hearts of the preferred stockholders had yielded to
</p>
<p>the melting inuence of spring. They were moved by a spirit
</p>

<p>the land grant to the extent of allowing the money arising
</p>
<p>from it to be expended upon the property, to the manifest
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>benet of the common stockholders. But if they would
</p>
<p>not be beneted in this way, then the prospect of dividends
</p>
<p>to the common stockholders would be very remote, and
</p>
<p> even if drawings of preferred stock at par were practicable
</p>
<p>(WHICH THEY ARE NOT), there would be little left for such
</p>
<p>drawings.
</p>
<p>This approximates to a threat I should say. But now
</p>
<p>hear the Great Mogul in further laying down the law to his
</p>
<p>subjects.  T lzerefore, what the common stockholders have
</p>
<p>to consider is, whether they prefer to continue under the ex-
</p>
<p>istingplan or agreement without change, in order that their
</p>
<p>posterity may acquire the ultimate ownership of the prop-
</p>
<p>erty through the slow process of extinction of the preferred
</p>
<p>stock, to be nally accomplished at some remote period in
</p>
<p>the dim and distant future; or have such alterations made in
</p>
<p>the plan as will put still greater life and vigor into the
</p>
<p>enterprise by making such improvements upon the property
</p>
<p>as will insure them an immediate return in dividends upon
</p>
<p>their stock.
</p>
<p>What is their proposed alteration of the plan that is to give
</p>
<p>such wonderful vigor to the enterprise as to work this im-
</p>
<p>mediate evolution of dividends; this sort of spontaneous
</p>
<p>eruption of net earnings, to rejoice the hearts of the common
</p>
<p>stockholders? It is to give the stumpage money for im-
</p>
<p>provements. That will work the miracle of six per cent.
</p>
<p>for the common stockholders right away. Now for the
</p>
<p>Managements own comment on it in the same article.
</p>
<p>Adopting the editorial phraseology they say :  Our corre-
</p>
<p>spondent is bothering himself about the advantage that the
</p>
<p>preferred stockholders will receive in the enhanced value
</p>
<p>of their stock as an assured 7 per cent. stock, when it is
</p>
<p>SETTLED that it cannot be drawn at par, and is also con_
</p>
<p>cerned about the larger vote of the preferred stockholders.
</p>
<p>He may consider'it a fact that the PLAN CANNOT BE CARRIED
</p>
<p>OUT as far as suc/z drawings are concerned, and that if it could,

</p>
<p>the amount of stock that could be drawn with the available
</p>
<p>proceeds from land and stumpage,would be too small a per-
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>centage of the whole issue to materially affect the price one
</p>
<p>way or the other after this fact became well known.
</p>
<p>Now it is this inappreciable percentagethese innitesi-
</p>
<p>mally small proceeds from stumpagew hose diversion from
</p>
<p>the retirement of preferred stock to improvements and ad-
</p>
<p>ditions is warranted to give such vigor to the whole enter-
</p>
<p>prise that it will pay full dividends z'nstanter to the common
</p>
<p>stockholders. Is not a mere statement of this absurd prop-
</p>
<p>osition a demonstration of the fraud that lurks in it?
</p>
<p>Just give them this, and thus make the preferred stock
</p>
<p> assured  and a full dividend  is promised for the next
</p>
<p>scal year; but if you dont accede to this demand, then
</p>
<p>your dividends will be enjoyed only by your remote
</p>
<p> posterity  in the  dim and distant future.
</p>
<p>But there is more of this, much more, tending to show in
</p>
<p>a manner the most conclusive, that the averments in the
</p>
<p>bill of Mr. Baring-Wells of bad faith and fraud are entirely
</p>
<p>well sustained by the facts. Do not these various proposi-
</p>
<p>tions, arguments and suggestions point to only one result,
</p>
<p>and do they not establish beyond any question that there
</p>
<p>existed in the early part of 1886 a denite and resolute in-
</p>
<p>tention of  converting the redeemable preferred stock into a
</p>
<p>permanent stoch and charge on the property of the said defend-
</p>
<p>ant Corporation, and to perpetuate indenitely the exclusive
</p>
<p>control of the holders thereof over the property and affairs of
</p>
<p>said defendant Corporation  to the irreparable injury of the
</p>
<p>common stockholders, and their permanent exclusion from
</p>
<p>the advantages which. the plan of reorganization was de-
</p>
<p>signed to secure to them. This is what the bill of com-
</p>
<p>plaint charges, and this is what lam now undertaking to
</p>
<p>prove.
</p>
<p>In the article which I have last cited, several methods are
</p>
<p>suggested by the Management by which  the earnings
</p>
<p>upon the common stock may be divided instead of being
</p>
<p>kept in the mortnzaz'n of the Corporation. Why was not one

</p>
<p>of these several methods adopted to accomplish an object
</p>
<p>so manifestly just, and one so likely to allay the dissatis-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>faction of the common stockholder? Let us examine these
</p>
<p>methods. For convenience I will discuss the rst two by
</p>
<p>themselves. They are thus stated by the Management:
</p>
<p>(1.) The money for improvements may be borrowed
</p>
<p>upon bond, secured by second mortgage when authorized
</p>
<p>by the stockholders.  _
</p>
<p>(2.)  The dividends upon common stock may be paid in
</p>
<p>common stock, as dividends upon preferred stock were paid
</p>
<p>in preferred stock. 
</p>
<p>These were two legitimate methods of raising money to
</p>
<p>be put into permanent improvements. They contemplate
</p>
<p>borrowing money, rst from the public on bonds, and sec-
</p>
<p>ondly from the common stockholders by appropriating to
</p>
<p>the use of the Corporation the surplus income from the road
</p>
<p>and the lands which \belonged to the common stockholders.
</p>
<p>For assuming the liabilities on the bonds, and surrendering
</p>
<p>their claim on the surplus income, the common stockholders
</p>
<p>were to be compensated by a distribution of common stock
</p>
<p>sufcient to cover all their advances of this nature to the
</p>
<p>Corporation.
</p>
<p>The comment of the Management on these methods is
</p>
<p>something delicious:  The rst two propositions would
</p>
<p>doubtless be rejected as inexpedient.
</p>
<p> lnexpedient. Why ineXpedientP For whom inexpe-
</p>
<p>dient? It was clearly not inexpedient for the Corporation
</p>
<p>to obtain all the money it might want on bonds which its
</p>
<p>large credit and resources enable it to negotiate on very
</p>
<p>favorable terms. It was clearly not inexpedient for the com-
</p>
<p>mon stockholders to receive something to represent the
</p>
<p>million of bonds with interest, and the $820,000 of prefer-
</p>
<p>red stock with the dividends on it, and the million and a
</p>
<p>half of their cash that had been put into the road in the
</p>
<p>three years previous. For Z/zem this distribution of com-
</p>
<p>mon stock would have been singularly expedient; ex-
</p>
<p>tremely  t and proper under the circumstances, as

</p>
<p>Webster denes the word. Inexpedient he denes as
</p>
<p>something not tending to promote a purpose. In this
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>sense, of course, as applied to the preferred stockholders,
</p>
<p>the word was selected with remarkable perspicuity by the
</p>
<p>Management. The adoption of these propositions, or either
</p>
<p>of them, would have had no tendency whatever to  pro-
</p>
<p>mote the purpose of the Management to convert their lien
</p>
<p>into a permanent ownership stock, or to coerce the common
</p>
<p>stockholders to acquiesce in a detrimental change of the
</p>
<p>plan. But there remain three other methods to be con-
</p>
<p>sidered.
</p>
<p>(3.)  The purchase or drawing of preferred stock at par
</p>
<p>or under, with surplus proceeds of sales of lands and stump-
</p>
<p>age or earnings of the railroad, may be suspended or dis-
</p>
<p>continued by the authority of the stockholders, and the
</p>
<p>surplus proceeds of land and stumpage sales be applied to
</p>
<p>necessary improvements.
</p>
<p>(4.)  Upon its advance to par and upwards, the nearly
</p>
<p>two millions unissued common stock may be sold from time
</p>
<p>to time, as required, to purchase means for the improve-
</p>
<p>ments. '
</p>
<p>(5.) The dividends upon common stock may be ad-
</p>
<p>vanced by authority of the stockholders to seven per cent.
</p>
<p>per annum whenever the earnings shall warrant, and any
</p>
<p>excess of earnings be divided equally upon both classes
</p>
<p>of stock.
</p>
<p>There is no inexpediency  about these last three prop-
</p>
<p>ositions; none in the world. The Management are really
</p>
<p>quite enthusiastic over them. After rejecting the rst two 
</p>
<p>propositions 'othand, and without asking any consideration
</p>
<p>for either of them, the Management continue in the words
</p>
<p>following, to wit: The adoption of the third proposition
</p>
<p>would furnish all the money likely to be required for im-
</p>
<p>provements, and leave the entire net earnings of the railroad
</p>
<p>for dividends upon the preferred and common stock, which
</p>
<p>would enable the Company to continue the seven per cent.
</p>
<p>on the preferred stock and pay six per cent. on the common

</p>
<p>stock, if the anticipated increase in earnings are [is] real-
</p>
<p>.ized.
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>The increase has been realized, and now a dividend is
</p>
<p>withheld because it has been realized. A shabby book-keep-
</p>
<p>ing device is resorted to with the view of showing that
</p>
<p>there are no net earnings. The Management have spent all
</p>
<p>the land-grant money on the improvements, and still not a
</p>
<p>dollar of the net earnings is applied to the promised divi-
</p>
<p>dend, the payment of which they say would cause the
</p>
<p>common stock to advance to par or upwards, when it could
</p>
<p>be sold from time to time as money for improvements were
</p>
<p>required, should the proceeds of sales of lands and stump-
</p>
<p>age prove insufcient, or it should not be desirable to thus
</p>
<p>expend them. '
</p>
<p>This cool proposition of the lien-holders to sell the com-
</p>
<p>mon stock in the treasury that belongs to the common
</p>
<p>stockholders, and give the proceeds to the Corporation, is
</p>
<p>on a par with all their other propositions. 'If any such stock
</p>
<p>remains in the treasury after the present common stock-
</p>
<p>holders are paid their deferred dividends, they will prob-
</p>
<p>ably be able to make disposition of it by a Board of Direct-
</p>
<p>ors chosen by the owners of the property and not by the
</p>
<p>quasi-mortgagees. ' '
</p>
<p>But there is yet more of the same sort. Let us hear
</p>
<p>what would be the happy results of the adoption of the
</p>
<p>third and fourth propositions. That, the Management say,
</p>
<p>would eventually result in making the fth proposition
</p>
<p>possible. It would seem to be to theint/erest of both classes
</p>
<p>of stockholders that the Management be authorized to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed under the third, fourth and fth propositions at their
</p>
<p>discretion.
</p>
<p>By all means. The propositions contemplating a certain
</p>
<p>measure of justice to the common stockholders who own
</p>
<p>the property, and have put three and a half millions into it,
</p>
<p>without receiving even so much as a free pass to represent
</p>
<p>it for ten years waiting, during which the preferred stock-
</p>
<p>holders have pocketed nearly three millions of dollars, are

<p>to be rejected in a summary style as inexpedient. The
</p>
<p>fancied-control of Directors releases them, to be sure,
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>'frOm the necessity of doing anything whatever for the com-
</p>
<p>mon stockholders. They may be treated with contempt,
</p>
<p>Y and all their just demands may be superciliously  rejected
</p>
<p>as not entitled even to a decent entertainment. But here
</p>
<p>are three propositions, calculated and intended to rob the
</p>
<p>_ common stockholder of important and essential rights in the
</p>
<p>property, and the Management are stimulating and encour-
</p>
<p>aging the adoption of them. I will cite the nal sentence
</p>
<p>of this extraordinary article which anticipates the ideas and
</p>
<p>sometimes the very language afterwards employed in the
</p>
<p>scandalous resolution of the 12th May.
</p>
<p>The adoptiOn of the third proposition, say the Man-
</p>
<p>agement, is undoubtedly the most important at this time,
</p>
<p>as it will at once remove all, difculties and questions in
</p>
<p>regard to the practicability of the unnecessary and improvi-
</p>
<p>dent retirement of the preferred stock with money that may
</p>
<p>innitely better be used in the establishment of an improvi-
</p>
<p>dent [sz'c] fund.
</p>
<p> Impracticable, unnecessary, and improvident
</p>
<p>these are the terms which the Management apply to a trust
</p>
<p>whiCh they do not intend to defeat,  evade, or per-
</p>
<p>vert. They recommend and urge the adoption of proposi-
</p>
<p>tions which would leave them in effect no trust to execute;
</p>
<p>and yet the Corporation is made to swear for them that
</p>
<p>they have never had any other policy than that of carrying
</p>
<p>out the very terms of the plan, and ofretiring the preferred
</p>
<p>stock} as  rapidly  as they can consistently with the duty
</p>
<p>of the Corporation to the public.
</p>
<p>_ The proper judges of the duty theCorporation owes to
</p>
<p>the public are the owners of the property, and not the quasi-
</p>
<p>mortgagees, scheming to make themselves the owners, to
</p>
<p>the lasting detriment of the common stockholders.
</p>
<p>-- So much for the scheme of the Management in April.
</p>
<p>_ It had not changed much in May. The threat then held out
</p>
<p>was that both classes of stockholders must work in har-

<p>mony, as they have done heretofore, if they expect to de-
</p>
<p>velop the property into a paying one for the common stock.
</p>
<p>'24
</p>
<p>holders. That is to say, the common stockholders must
</p>
<p>keep quiet, and take just what the Directors have a mind
</p>
<p>noz to give them now, or they will never get anything.
</p>
<p>If, say the Management,  the common stockholders
</p>
<p>choose to insist that the plan cannot be altered, * * then it
</p>
<p>follows as a matter of course that the seven per cent. must
</p>
<p>all be taken from the earnings of the railroad, if sufficient for
</p>
<p>the purpose, and such necessary improvements as shall be
</p>
<p>made must be taken from the same source. If this will
</p>
<p>leave anything for the common stockholders for some years
</p>
<p>to come, we are very much mistaken. -
</p>
<p>There is a view of the case in the same article which we
</p>
<p>would recommend to the notice of Counsel who advised the
</p>
<p>Corporation that it could swear to the answer without im-
</p>
<p>peachment of its veracity.  The plan of reorganization, I
</p>
<p>quote textually,  secures the preferred stockholders in the
</p>
<p>control of the property, and in their seven per cent. per annum
</p>
<p>so long as,the income from all sources will pay it. T lzey
</p>
<p>have therefore no need to trouble themselves about im-
</p>
<p>proving or extending the property in order to make sure of
</p>
<p>their dividends. That isjust about the size of it. But it is an
</p>
<p>awfully long time that they claim to be insured for; they might
</p>
<p>almost as well have used the old formula  as long as grass
</p>
<p>grows and water runs. If they could get out a policy to
</p>
<p>insure themselves against re for the same length of time,
</p>
<p>I can imagine circumstances under which it might prove
</p>
<p>a convenience not easily over-estimated.
</p>
<p>In the latter part of May, the Management came to the
</p>
<p>front once more in the advocacy of non-retirement. They
</p>
<p>are dealing with an unbelieving common stockholder, who
</p>
<p>was so unreasonable as to advise an adherence to the plan,
</p>
<p>which they now swear they intend to carry out the moment
</p>
<p>they can get money enough. Hear how they scold him for
</p>
<p>intimating that this would be the fair thing to do.  He
</p>
<p>wants the property to come into the hands of the common

<p>stockholders by the slow process of retiring the $5,376,970
</p>
<p>preferred stock, which would take forty to fty years, sup-
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>posing the lands ever to yield so much, which no one know-
</p>
<p>ing anything about them expects." Very well. The lands
</p>
<p>it seems are not worth the money named, and the process
</p>
<p>of redeeming them is so slow, that the Management propose,
</p>
<p> in the interest of the common stockholders, to make it slower
</p>
<p>still by xing it so that the process should not proceed
</p>
<p>at all. If these objections can be removed, the Corporation
</p>
<p>swears it would be only too happy to redeem the preferred
</p>
<p>stock and always would have been. Put in a mark here
</p>
<p>for future reference.
</p>
<p>Now listen, common stockholders, to the eulogy the Man-
</p>
<p>agement deliver on themselves in their own lifetime. It is
</p>
<p>at once touching in its pathos, conclusive in its argumen-
</p>
<p>tation, and pious in its scriptural allusions. It ought to melt
</p>
<p>a heart of stone. '
</p>
<p> The stockholders should judge the management by the
</p>
<p>results they have achieved.  By their fruits ye shall know
</p>
<p>them.  _
</p>
<p>This is certainly an excellent mode of judging, sustained
</p>
<p>by the same high authority that underlies the Decalogue.
</p>
<p>Well: What are the fruits? Not to put too ne a point on it:
</p>
<p>What are the fruits, past, present and to come; accrued, ac-
</p>
<p>cruing, or to accrue to the common stockholders? For
</p>
<p>the ten years past nothing. For the present, as the distin-
</p>
<p>guished jurist expressed himself in regard to a stock divi-
</p>
<p>dend a year ago, not a dollar, sir, not a dollar. For the
</p>
<p>future, something possible for  remote posterity  in the
</p>
<p>dim and distant future. Fruits forsooth? Leaves of the
</p>
<p>barren g-tree and apples of Sodom are all the fruits the
</p>
<p>Management vouchsafe to the common stockholders.
</p>
<p>After this brag about the fruits they ought to be judged
</p>
<p>by, and which the common stockholders fully appreciate,
</p>
<p>the Management vou-chsafe some oracular warnings about
</p>
<p>going to law. The common stockholders particularly should
</p>
<p>beware of any attempt to involve them in coszly lz'zzgazz'mz, in

</p>
<p>which they would have everything to lose and nothing to
</p>
<p>gain. A comparatively small increase of income from the
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>operation of the railroad means an early dividend to them.
</p>
<p>How does this tally with the threat of postponing all
</p>
<p>dividends to the days of posterity? And where is the early
</p>
<p>dividend  which we were told would come from the in-
</p>
<p>crease of income? The more the income increases, the
</p>
<p>less there is of it to pay the common stockholder.
</p>
<p>This threat too about the cost of litigation, though ex-
</p>
<p>tremely unbecoming in a trustee towards his beneciaries,
</p>
<p>is one in which members of the Management have indulged
</p>
<p>more than once. I have before me aletter from an eminent
</p>
<p>legal authority in which his correspondent is treated to a
</p>
<p>similar suggestion.  You speak about a lawsuit, says the
</p>
<p>trustee to his beneciary. Of course those who choose
</p>
<p>are at perfect liberty to indulge in that somewhat expensive
</p>
<p>luxury. But when the matter comes into the Courts, I
</p>
<p>think I can venture to promise that it will be found much
</p>
<p>easier to allege, than prove, that in the management of the
</p>
<p>affairs of the Company the common stockholders have been
</p>
<p>wronged to the amount of a single cent. It was no wrong
</p>
<p>to reissue mortgage stock to the amount of $820,000 to pay
</p>
<p>dividends that were not earned. It was no Wrong to saddle
</p>
<p>the common stockholders with a debt of a million of dollars
</p>
<p>to enable the preferred stockholders to pay themselves seven
</p>
<p>per cent. dividends which they now say ought to have been
</p>
<p>paid out of the income of the Company. It was no wrong
</p>
<p>to attempt to vote themselves three-fths of the property
</p>
<p>that belonged exclusively to the common stockholders.
</p>
<p>There is no difculty in proving all these wrongs, and
</p>
<p>others so numerous, that the main difculty with the C0urts
</p>
<p>will be to nd any rights whatever that the Management
</p>
<p>concede to the common stockholders.
</p>
<p>This is an interesting inquiry. WVhat single right do the
</p>
<p>Directors recognize as appertaining to the common stock-
</p>
<p>holders who are the real owners of the property? They
</p>
<p>have no right to a single ,vote in the Board, absolutely no

<p>pany. They have no right to any money dividends, though
</p>
<p>the net earnings are amply sufcent to pay them. They
</p>
<p>have no right to any stock dividend, though the whole two
</p>
<p>millions of common stock unissued belong to them alone,
</p>
<p>and represent but a portion of the now nearly four millions
</p>
<p>which the common stockholders alone have contributed to
</p>
<p>the property since the reorganization. They have no right
</p>
<p>to demand the application of the net income from stumpage
</p>
<p>to the retirement of the preferred stock, though the plan
</p>
<p>expressly stipulates it shall be so applied. What single
</p>
<p>right do the Directors consider them entitled to? Not
</p>
<p>even the right to complain without being insulted. Not
</p>
<p>even the privileges of litigation without being taunted with
</p>
<p>the charge that they are indulging in a luxury beyond their
</p>
<p>means. They are absolutely driven into the Courts not
</p>
<p>merely to seek redress for their wrongs, but to ascertain if
</p>
<p>they have got any rights whatever.
</p>
<p>The Corporation in its answer swears that nobody ever
</p>
<p>had any idea- of evading the plan, but that they have always
</p>
<p>sought to carry it out and mean to retire the preferred stoch
</p>
<p>as rapidly as they can. How does this tally with the specu-
</p>
<p>lations of the Management in the Record of 11th June, the
</p>
<p>last issue before the annual meeting of stockholders? The
</p>
<p>Management say that they have not asked in the resolution
</p>
<p>of 12th May for a permanent suspension of the plan, but a
</p>
<p>temporary one,  wisely leaving the question of permanent
</p>
<p>suspension and the practicability or legality of the purchase
</p>
<p>or drawing of preferred stock until it shall be better under-
</p>
<p>stood. Here .it is held out to the timid or ill-informed
</p>
<p>common stockholders that serious questions exist as to the
</p>
<p>practicability and legality of the plan, a suggestion utterly
</p>
<p>_ unwarrantable and improper in a trustee. This is followed
</p>
<p>up by a promise to pay  the proposed seven per cent. in
</p>
<p>a short time, during which time the stockholders will

<p>be enabled to ascertain the legal possibilities." The
</p>
<p>Directors propose to temporarily take money that can in no
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>event be used to pay dividends upon the common stock and apply
</p>
<p>it to improvements," the money being, every dollar of it,
</p>
<p>pledged to the retirement of the preferred stock, which
</p>
<p>was the best dividend a common stockholder could possibly
</p>
<p>receive. The italics employed to display the inveracity to
</p>
<p>the best advantage are those of the Management. They
</p>
<p>then go on to express their inability to comprehend how
</p>
<p>any intelligent common stockholder could oppose the reso-
</p>
<p>lution, unless he disregarded the present market and pro-
</p>
<p>ductive value of his stock, in the vague hope that his poster-
</p>
<p>z'ty may, long after he is dead and <gone, come into his share of
</p>
<p>a property of whose value then, in view of certain increas-
</p>
<p>ing competition, no one can prophecy.
</p>
<p>Remember that this Record reaches some seven hundred
</p>
<p>of the one thousand stockholders of the St. Paul and Duluth
</p>
<p>Railroad Company. Here is a menace sent to every one
</p>
<p>of the common stockholders, that unless the resolution is
</p>
<p>adopted, the Management cannot pay them any dividend
</p>
<p>till long after they are dead and buried, and then,I sup-
</p>
<p>pose, they would only pay them by jingling the money on
</p>
<p>their tombstones, or by remitting in checks payable'to their
</p>
<p>order. N o threat in this! No intention to evade,  per-
</p>
<p>vert or defeat the trust!
</p>
<p>In its answer the Corporation gives no satisfactory ex-
</p>
<p>planation of the stock dividends. It shows even more con-
</p>
<p>clusively than in its rst answer that in the years for which
</p>
<p>these dividends were paid it did not have, and could not
</p>
<p>have had from all sources together, one dollar of money or
</p>
<p>property applicable to the payment of dividends. For
</p>
<p>several years, it says in one place, for many years, in
</p>
<p>another place, its business was  unprotable, and not suf-
</p>
<p>cient to meet its current expenses, as was undoubtedly
</p>
<p>true. The several and many years included certainly as
</p>
<p>many as four; and yet for the years 1881 and 1882, as I
</p>
<p>will show shortly, it allowed in dividends to its preferred

<p>stockholders, in cash and stock, upwards of a million of
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>dollars. In a previous* pamphlet I have sufciently
</p>
<p>considered the dividend of 1881. The stock dividend
</p>
<p>of 1884 stands on a somewhat different footing. It was
</p>
<p>made at a time when, if a dividend had been lawfully due,
</p>
<p>the Corporation could have paid it in cash, and ought to
</p>
<p>have paid it in cash. Not only was the issue of $350,000
</p>
<p>preferred stock for purposes of a dividend in 1884 unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful, fraudulent and void, for the grounds stated in regard
</p>
<p>to the issue of 1881, but it had a cumulative title to fraud,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it was an over-issue beyond the six millions
</p>
<p>authorized by the Charter.
</p>
<p>Though the annual report of 1884 is entirely silent as to
</p>
<p>the reason for making this extraordinary dividend in this
</p>
<p>unlawful manner, I have come recently into possession of
</p>
<p>a circular from the Secretary and Treasurer of the Company
</p>
<p>at that time which throws some light on it. From this
</p>
<p>circular, bearing date July 11, 1884, I learn that at the
</p>
<p>annual meeting of the stockholders held at St. Paul on the
</p>
<p>16th of June of that year, the following resolutions were
</p>
<p>adopted by a two-thirds vote of both common and pre-
</p>
<p>ferred stock :
</p>
<p>Whereas, A large portion of the income of this Company for the
</p>
<p>past three years has been devoted to various improvements and addi-
</p>
<p>tions to the railroad and equipments, and to the purchase and con-
</p>
<p>struction of branch roads connected with the main line, and in the
</p>
<p>acquirement of other valuable property, which appears upon the books
</p>
<p>of the Company unrepresented by capital stock; and whereas there
</p>
<p>remains due fo the preferred stockholders out of the income for the scal
</p>
<p>year ending june 30, 1882, an undeclared dividend of three and one-half
</p>
<p>per cent. and a like dividend of three and one half per cent. will be
</p>
<p>due on July 1, 1884, out of the income for the scal year ending June
</p>
<p>30, 1884, therefore;
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the Board of Directors be authorized and directed to
</p>
<p>declare a dividend to the preferred stockholders of seven per cent,
</p>
<p>payable in the preferred stock of this Company; provided, that after

</p>
<p>having submitted the question to competent legal authority, they are
</p>
<p>advised of their right under the law to do so. This dividend to be in
</p>
<p>full of all amounts due to said preferred stockholders up to and includ-
</p>
<p>ing the rst day of july, 1884.
</p>
<p>The lawfulness of this dividend it seems was questioned,
</p>
<p>and-the preferred stockholders were obliged to shelter the
</p>
<p>Directors under a legal opinion. They were advised, as is '
</p>
<p>alleged, by  competent legal authority, in the rst place,
</p>
<p>that they could pay an  undeclared dividend  alleged to be
</p>
<p> DUE  for the scal year ending in june, 1882. That is to
</p>
<p>say, the Directors of 1882, who had sole jurisdiction over
</p>
<p>the dividend of that year, did not, th0ugh they were
</p>
<p>authorized to, declare any dividend beyond what they-had
</p>
<p>already declared, to wit, ten per cent. in preferred stock,
</p>
<p>paid some time in November, 1881, and dividends Nos. 1,
</p>
<p>2 and 3, paid in 1882. So we have here another curiosity in
</p>
<p>law, never before heard of or imagined, to wit,  an unde-
</p>
<p>clared dividend DUE the preferred stockholders! In
</p>
<p>view of the fact that the preferred stockholders had helped
</p>
<p>themselves, with signal liberality, to $470,000 in stock and
</p>
<p>$358,641.50 in cash in the years 188182, it would have been
</p>
<p>crowding the mourners a little too aggressively to declare
</p>
<p>another dividend in nd year of our Lord. So the Directors
</p>
<p>of 1882 declined to make any further dividend either in
</p>
<p>cash or stock, and there was the end of the matter. No
</p>
<p>dividend can possibly be due till it is declared, and
</p>
<p>the Directors of 1882 having exercised their lawful discre-
</p>
<p>tion in the premises, and declined to  declare a dividend,
</p>
<p>that discretion could not be lawfully impeached and over-
</p>
<p>ridden by aBoard of 1884. It was not within the lawful
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the Board of 1884 to review their action, and
</p>
<p>to declare a dividend nunc pro tunc, even in cash, much less
</p>
<p>in over-issued preferred stock, or in stock that had been
</p>
<p>converted into lands and had ceased to have a lawful ex-
</p>
<p>istence. '

<p>By this extraordinary and unlawful action of the Direct-
</p>
<p>.ors it came to pass that from that little road of 155 miles-
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>decayed, dilapidated, struggling to save its life, in danger
</p>
<p>of losing its charter for the want of means necessary to en-
</p>
<p>able it to fulll its duties to the publicthe preferred stock-
</p>
<p>holders extracted for the years 1881-82 the enormous sum
</p>
<p>of $1,01 5,734 (one million fteen thousand seven hundred and
</p>
<p>thirty-four dollars)! And was this the whole story? By no
</p>
<p>means.- Besides saddling the Corporation with this large
</p>
<p>issue of spurious stock a second time, and paying what is
</p>
<p>substantially an enormous interest on it semi-annually for-
</p>
<p>ever, they loaded the Corporation with a million of bonded
</p>
<p>debt to pay for those very improvements for which they'
</p>
<p>voted themselves an alleged reimbursement from the Cor-
</p>
<p>poration.
</p>
<p>.And these are the gentlemen who now deny a dividend
</p>
<p>of either stock or cash to the common stockholders who
</p>
<p>have looked on patiently and submitted to the absorption by
</p>
<p>the Trustees of now quite four millions of dollars without
</p>
<p>applying a dollar of the net earnings of the railroad or the
</p>
<p>net proceeds of the land grant for ten years time to the
</p>
<p>specied purposes of their trust.
</p>
<p>The Trustees could nd in the empty treasury of the
</p>
<p>Corporation a million of dollars in 1881 and 1882 to apply
</p>
<p>to ten per cent. dividends in each year on the preferred
</p>
<p>stock, but they swear that they have never yet had one
</p>
<p>dollar properly applicable to any provision for the common
</p>
<p>stockholders. They swear to this, though if they had
</p>
<p>kept their books in 1885 and 1886 as they had always kept
</p>
<p>them down to that period, there would have been more
</p>
<p>than a million of dollars to do those very things which they
</p>
<p>swear they now fail to do solely for the want of funds
</p>
<p>properly applicable to the purpose.
</p>
<p>Fortunately it is a Corporation without any soul to save
</p>
<p>that does the swearing in this case. The seal is the culprit,
</p>
<p>and the Directors only swear pro forma by the advice of
</p>
<p>Counsel.

</p>
<p>The gross injustice of the Trustees in withholding
</p>
<p>earned dividends to which the common stockholders are
</p>
<p>32
</p>
<p>entitled is made more gross by the fact that the Trustees
</p>
<p>have acquiesced in the claim of the preferred stockholders
</p>
<p>that they had an insured dividend of seven per cent. -
</p>
<p>whether it was earned or not.
</p>
<p>WVhat was provided for in the plan was the payment of
</p>
<p> dividends semiannually, on the rst days of July and
</p>
<p>January in each year, equal to the net income from all
</p>
<p>sources ; - said dividends not to exceed seven per cent. per
</p>
<p>annum. When there was no net income there was no
</p>
<p>dividend payable under the plan. There was no such thing
</p>
<p>contemplated by the plan as an absolute seven per cent. in-
</p>
<p>terest to be paid whether earned or not, and involving the
</p>
<p>idea of making up arrears for the decit in years when the
</p>
<p>Directors had no means of paying a dividend and did not
</p>
<p>declare a dividend. This is too perfectly clear on the face
</p>
<p>of the plan to require illustration or argument to sustain it.
</p>
<p>But we are fortunately not without judicial authority
</p>
<p>on this point, for in the well considered opinion of a very
</p>
<p>able Court (Belfast R. R. Co. v. Belfast, 77 Maine R., 449),
</p>
<p>the clause of a by-law involving the same provisions as
</p>
<p>those of the plan was the subject of interpretation. The
</p>
<p>by-law was in the following words:
</p>
<p> Dividends on the preferred stock shall rst be made semi-annu-
</p>
<p>ally from the earnings of said road, not exceeding six per cent. per
</p>
<p>annurri, after which dividend, if there shall remain a surplus, a divi-
</p>
<p>dend shall be made upon the non-preferred up to a like per cent. per
</p>
<p>annum; and should a surplus then remain of net earnings, after both
</p>
<p>of said dividends, in any one year, the same shall be divided pro rata
</p>
<p>on all the stock.
</p>
<p>On these provisions the Court says, as the Court must
</p>
<p>say in the interpretation of the plan:  It was not intended
</p>
<p>to guarantee a dividend. If a dividend is prevented in any
</p>
<p>one year by a decit of earnings, it cann0t be made up from
</p>
<p>the earnings of succeding years. A six per cent. dividend
</p>
<p>is not insured by the contract of subscription. It may be

</p>
<p>less. The implication is clear that there is to be no surplus
</p>
<p>of prots to be carried from year to year. The net earnings
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>are tobe wholly distributed year. The language of
</p>
<p>the by-laiwii-s reallythe of the general law. It
</p>
<p>, promises divi'dendsw'henever are net earnings from
</p>
<p>which to make them. '
</p>
<p>In the case of Elhz'ns v. Camden and Atlamz'c R. R. Co.,
</p>
<p>36N. 9. 59., 23 5, the corporation, by a supplement to their
</p>
<p>charter, were "authorized to issue a million of preferred
</p>
<p>stock, the holders whereof should be entitled to receive '
</p>
<p>dividends on the same, not to exceed. seven per centum per
</p>
<p>annum, before any dividend shall be set apart or paid on
</p>
<p> the other or ordinary stock of said company. The Vice-
</p>
<p>Chancellorgisaid that calling a stock preferred does not de-
</p>
<p>ne its rights, but to determine what the preference is,
</p>
<p>resort must] be had to the contract under which it is issued.
</p>
<p>The meaning of the charter he held to be very clear. If
</p>
<p>there were no prots during the current year the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholder was not entitled to a dividend; if there were he
</p>
<p>1 Was entitledipto a preference to the extent of seven per cent. ;
</p>
<p>ifgthe prots were not sufcient to give him seven per
</p>
<p>cerii'tl}? he was entitled to a dividend at such rate as they
</p>
<p>were sufcient to pay, but not to carry any deciency or
</p>
<p>arrears over to a subsequent division of prots. In other
</p>
<p>words, his -.;r_ights are to be governed and regulated each
</p>
<p>year by the pecuniary condition of the corporation at the
</p>
<p>close of the year.
</p>
<p>It was held that the charter neither promised nor secured
</p>
<p>a dividend of any amount or at any rate, but simply declared
</p>
<p>that the dividend should not exceed a certain sum.
</p>
<p>The same rules of interpretation that apply to by-laws
</p>
<p>and to statutes, apply of course to charters and contracts.
</p>
<p>There is no case in the American Reports that conicts with
</p>
<p>the decisionsl have cited. Dividends guaranteed at a
</p>
<p>xed rate per annum are entirely different affairs. Of this
</p>
<p>description were the dividends guaranteed and declared
</p>
<p>cumulative in Boardmarz et al., v. Lake Shore and Mz'c/zzgarz

<p>R. R., 84 1V. Y., 161, and in Prouzy v. Mzc/zzgan Soul/zerrz, ezc.,
</p>
<p>I Hun, 655.
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>The cases in the English Courts are in harmony with the
</p>
<p>Maine and New Jersey decisions. They are all governed
</p>
<p>by the doctrine laid down by the Vice-Chancellor in Henry
</p>
<p>V. Great Northern Ry. Ca, 4 Kay & jo/tnston, 1. In that
</p>
<p>case the question was with regard to shares which s/zall
</p>
<p>dear and receive dividends at the rate of 4% per cent. per annurn
</p>
<p>in preference to the payment of dividends on the ordinary
</p>
<p>shares of the company. Here was a right to a xed pay-
</p>
<p>ment at a rate certain, payable till paid. It was in its nature
</p>
<p>interest at 4% per cent. and was so held to be cumulative.
</p>
<p>But the Vice-Chancellor said:
</p>
<p> Had it been  half-yearly dividends or yearly divi-
</p>
<p>dends or the like * * then indeed the case would have been
</p>
<p>the other way; then it would be plain that the division of
</p>
<p>prots was to take place half-yearly, and that out of the
</p>
<p>half-years or the years prots and out of those only the
</p>
<p>holders of preference shares were to have the dividend men-
</p>
<p>tioned in the act.
</p>
<p>An interesting question then arises as to the rights of the
</p>
<p>parties where one stock with a prior right to dividends has
</p>
<p>received them for a number of years, during which no divi-
</p>
<p>dend has been paid on the junior stock entitled to dividends
</p>
<p>when earned. This becomes important in respect to the
</p>
<p>rights of the common stockholders of the St. Paul and
</p>
<p>Duluth Railroad, in the earnings of the railroad when it
</p>
<p>shows a surplus applicable to the retirement of the preferred
</p>
<p>stock. When that surplus arises, before it can be used for
</p>
<p>retiring purposes, it must be used in paying the arrears of
</p>
<p>six per cent. dividends to the common stock for every seven
</p>
<p>per cent. dividend that has been paid to the preferred, either
</p>
<p>in stock or money. This principle was distinctly established
</p>
<p>in the case of Allen v. Londonderry, etc., Ry. Co., 25 Week R.,
</p>
<p>524, and there is not a case in the Reports which contra-
</p>
<p> venes it. In that case the company issued shares entitled
</p>
<p>to a preferential dividend of ,5 5 per annum, with a dividend

</p>
<p>of  5 to the ordinary shareholder when earned, any surplus
</p>
<p>to be divided when accruing between the two classes of
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>stock. The preferred shareholders received their ,5 5 for a
</p>
<p>number of years, during which there was nothing earned
</p>
<p>for the ordinary stock. When enough was reached to pay
</p>
<p>both classes,with a surplus, the Court held that the common
</p>
<p>stockholders were entitled to their arrears of dividends be-
</p>
<p>fore the preferred shareholders could participate in the sur-
</p>
<p>plus. This was equitable, and good law, because it took
</p>
<p>away the temptation which has wrecked the reputation
</p>
<p>of the Management in the St. Paul and Duluth.
</p>
<p>Inow propose to consider that portion of the answer
</p>
<p>which relates to the reissue of cancelled stock. You remem-
</p>
<p>ber that by the articles of incorporation it was provided
</p>
<p>that the preferred stock should be receivable, as the mort-
</p>
<p>gage bonds were, in payment for lands, and that when so
</p>
<p>received and used in the purchase of land it should lose its
</p>
<p>voting power in the election of Directors, and in other pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings and meetings of stockholders. Whether kept alive
</p>
<p>or cancelled, whether issued or reissued, in whatever form it
</p>
<p>might exist or not exist, its voting power was gone forever.
</p>
<p>The Management say in the Railroad Record, March 24
</p>
<p>1886, that $993,883 of the capital stock of the Company has
</p>
<p>been retired and cancelled. If that is so, and the preferred
</p>
<p>stock is limited by the charter to $6,000,000, there cannot
</p>
<p>possibly be in legal existence more than $5,006,117, or some
</p>
<p>50,000 shares of preferred stock. This result is arrived at
</p>
<p>by deducting from the full amount of the stock authorized
</p>
<p>the amount that, by the terms of the plan, has forever lost its
</p>
<p>power of voting.
</p>
<p>The answer of the Corporation admits and alleges that
</p>

</p>
<p>to any amount to or among any persons.
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>Now there was reissued and divided among the pre-
</p>
<p>ferred stockholders exactly $820,000 of the cancelled pre-
</p>
<p>ferred stock that has no voting power in the election of
</p>
<p>Directors, or in the proceedings and meetings of Directors.
</p>
<p>It is issued, of course, in new certicates, but it is none
</p>
<p>the less the old stock. There is a portion of the $993,883
</p>
<p>still guring in the semi-annual slips with which the Vice-
</p>
<p>President illustrates his remarkable power of book-keep-
</p>
<p>ing. This is the sum of $146,877.39, as a balance of re-
</p>
<p>alized income from cancelled preferred stock. It has re-
</p>
<p>mained at about that gure ever since 1884, when the
</p>
<p>stockholders of record in August of that year had reduced
</p>
<p>the  cancelled preferred stock  materially by voting them-
</p>
<p>selves seven (7) per cent. of the  realized income ~ accruing
</p>
<p>from cancelled preferred stock. Half of that they voted
</p>
<p>themselves on the ground of its being an undeclared divi-
</p>
<p>dend. They never thought they were violating the eighth
</p>
<p>commandment when the stockholders of record in August,
</p>
<p>1884, voted themselves a quantity of preferred stock that
</p>
<p>was due, if it was due to anybody, to the stockholders of
</p>
<p>record in 1882.
</p>
<p>It is not surprising however that men who conspire to
</p>
<p>vote themselves other peoples property in 1886, should
</p>
<p>have conspired to vote themselves other peoples property
</p>
<p>in 1884. This was paid in the realized income, to wit,
</p>
<p>from preferred stock cancelled. Now the law deals with
</p>
<p>facts and substances, not with shams and shadows. Can
</p>
<p>you evade, pervert  and  defeat the law by saying
</p>
<p>we cannot issue this preferred st00k again with voting
</p>
<p>power, but we can issue new stock to represent the re-
</p>
<p>alized income we have to distribute, and invest the repre-
</p>
<p>sentative, and mere equivalent of the original with a power
</p>
<p>which the original had lost forever?
</p>
<p>When the answer admits that the stock originally issued
</p>
<p>for specic purposes had fullled those purposes, and had

</p>
<p>been lawfully reduced to $4,706,090 by cancellation, there
</p>
<p>was no lawful way by which the stock which represents the
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>difference between $4,706,090 and $ 5 , 3 76,970.6o,the preferred
</p>
<p>stock now outstanding, could be lawfully reinvested with
</p>
<p>the voting power. Will any one pretend that the cancelled
</p>
<p>preferred stock now guring as a balance of  realized in-
</p>
<p>come  could in anybodys hands, by itself or its substitute,
</p>
<p>become anything but what it is, a non-voting stock? If you
</p>
<p>could not make a voting stock out of that, how could you
</p>
<p>make a valid voting stock out of the $820,000 that have dis-
</p>
<p>appeared from the balance of realized income to swell the
</p>
<p>lawful outstanding stock of $4,706,090 to 8 5, 3 76,970.60?
</p>
<p>I repeat that whatever else this $820,000 of stock may
</p>
<p>bewhether issued or reissued, cancelled or uncancelled,
</p>
<p>it is the very stock which represents the stock that, having
</p>
<p>been once employed in the purchase and payment of land
</p>
<p>can never be reinvested with the power of voting.
</p>
<p>We could make a fair suggestion to the holders of this
</p>
<p>spurious stock, which it would be well for them to accept.
</p>
<p>Let them abstain from voting it at the coming election of
</p>
<p>Directors, for there is no difculty in tracing it through
</p>
<p>the certicates. Very much of it is in the hands of the
</p>
<p>original holders; very little of it is in the hands of innocent
</p>
<p>parties. Let them abstain from voting, and let the plaintiff
</p>
<p>in the pending suit enter into a stipulation not to press
</p>
<p>for a decree declaring their stock void and fraudulent, but
</p>
<p>recognize it as a subsisting lien, entitled to the same con-
</p>
<p>sideration as the preferred stock legally outstanding. I say
</p>
<p>that this would be wise, as there is no reason to question
</p>
<p>that the provision of the plan depriving it of its voting
</p>
<p>power can be enforced in law.
</p>
<p>In replication to the general denial in the answer of
</p>
<p>fraudulent intent or practice on the part of the Directors, I
</p>
<p>might as well here, as in any other connection, recur to the
</p>
<p>remarkable change in the book-keeping methods of the
</p>
<p>Corporation to escape the payment of dividends to the com-
</p>
<p>mon stockholder.

</p>
<p>The intention of practicing this book-keeping dodge was
</p>
<p>rst avowed in a slip issued from the Philadelphia branch
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>ofce, dated September 1, 1885, in the same covert and
</p>
<p>guileless manner which marked the introduction of the
</p>
<p>bamboozling resolution in 1886. Observe the language I
</p>
<p>have italicised below, and note how readily it might escape
</p>
<p>the average stockholder that the only object of the change
</p>
<p>was to diddle him out of his dividends and prolong the
</p>
<p>life of the preferred stock.
</p>
<p> Of the $140,020.91 expenditure for improvement, construction
</p>
<p>and equipment for year ending june 30, 1885, $53,794.27 incurred in
</p>
<p>the rst six months was charged to cost of road and equipment 1N Ac-
</p>
<p>coRDANCE WITH PREVIOUS CUSTOM, and the remaining $80,226. 84, in-
</p>
<p>curred in the last six months, was included in operating expense and
</p>
<p>CHARGED AGAINST THE EARNINGS, making a corresponding reduction in
</p>
<p>the net income from the operation of the railroad as compared with
</p>
<p>previous years; and it is expected that the income from all sources
</p>
<p>will hereafter be suicient to allow such expenditures TO BE INCLUDED
</p>
<p>IN OPERATING ExPENSEs IN FUTURE. 
</p>
<p>So boldly had these men been bamboozling the common
</p>
<p>stockholders and the public for a series of years without
</p>
<p>being called to account for it, that. they avow the purpose
</p>
<p>of changing an uniform previous custorn, which was in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance with the rights of parties and the provisions of
</p>
<p>the plan (indispensable indeed to the proper carrying out of
</p>
<p>the plan), and including all expenditures for improvement,
</p>
<p>construction and equipment in operating expenses for all
</p>
<p>time to come! Why? Because by pursuing that course
</p>
<p>they could keep the common stockholders out of their
</p>
<p>dividends forever. The plan says that the six per cent. of
</p>
<p>the common stockholder shall be paid out of the net earnings
</p>
<p>of the railroad. The Directors attempt by a book-keeping
</p>
<p>expedient to prevent the possibility of any net earnings ever
</p>
<p>appearing. And yet the Corporation swear that these good
</p>
<p>Directors never, never, contemplated fraud to any ex-
</p>
<p>tent!  Yes, with a grim humor that'would be amusing if
</p>
<p>it were not exasperating, the Corporation denies that the

</p>
<p>defendant had done anything  with any view of carrying
</p>
<p>out, to any extent, any fraudulent scheme! Well, I should
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>say that the intention of the preferred stockholders to vote
</p>
<p>themselves a large amount of property that did not belong
</p>
<p>to them, was carrying out a fraudulent scheme to an extent
</p>
<p>quite sufcient to swallow up a good many millions.
</p>
<p>This however introduces us to another branch of the
</p>
<p>answer in which it treats specically of the bamboozling
</p>
<p>resolution, and not only alleges that the defendants did not
</p>
<p>intend to defraud  to any extent, but adds, with an aver-
</p>
<p>ment that to the defendants themselves must have been
</p>
<p>somewhat amusing, that a majority of the holders of the
</p>
<p>common stock of said defendant Corporation present at said
</p>
<p>meeting in person or by proxy, actually favored the adoption,
</p>
<p>then and there, of said proposed change of plan.
</p>
<p>In reply to this last assertion, it is only necessary to say
</p>
<p>that the common stockholders did, as they had been for
</p>
<p>years in the habit of doing; they sent their proxies to
</p>
<p>William H. Rhawn, on his earnest solicitation and request,
</p>
<p>and his assurance that the resolution was very important
</p>
<p>for their interests, in no wise detrimental, but, on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, highly advantageous. These assertions were rein
</p>
<p>forced by his reiterated assurances in the Record that every-
</p>
<p>body acquiesced in it, and that if they did not pass the resolu-
</p>
<p>tion, the common stockholders could not get any dividend
</p>
<p>till they were dead and buried. From the duciary relation
</p>
<p>in which Mr. Rhawn stood to them, they believed him and
</p>
<p>sent him their proxies, because no effort was made by the
</p>
<p>protestants on that occasion to procure proxies, for the
</p>
<p>reason that their votes could not affect the result. To sup-
</p>
<p>pose that any common stockholder, with sense enough to
</p>
<p>keep him outside of an idiot asylum, could have read that
</p>
<p>resolution understandingly, and actually favored its adop-
</p>
<p>tion  is something that only a corporation could swear to,
</p>
<p>and that Mr. Rhawn himself cannot believe for a moment.
</p>
<p>The resolution is now perfectly well understood, and let us
</p>
<p>see how many common stockholders will vote for it at the

<p>meeting in June. '
</p>
<p>A question of interest-in connection with this resolution
</p>
<p>_4.0
</p>
<p>of May 12th, arises as to the capacity of the Trustees to
</p>
<p>understand it. They are not quick of apprehension. They
</p>
<p>had had the plan before them for ten years, and yet thought
</p>
<p>it would be a good thing to postpone carrying it out so that
</p>
<p>they and others might be better able to judge what it means.
</p>
<p>They could not understand Mr. Sargents protest. It
</p>
<p>was not intelligible to them, though it is written in the
</p>
<p>English language, in a style level to the humblest capacity,
</p>
<p>and is just as plain as the nose on a mans face. It is a
</p>
<p>singular fact that the preferred stockholders understand it,
</p>
<p>and that from the day it was led investors have never
</p>
<p>bought the preferred stock at a price exceeding that of a
</p>
<p>perfectly well secured ve per cent. bond, in spite of the
</p>
<p>bulling articles in the Record, describing it as an assured 7
</p>
<p>per cent. stock with no prospect of redemption. It is
</p>
<p>equally singular that since it has been generally circulated,
</p>
<p>and a few intelligent common stockholders have satised
</p>
<p>themselves of the verity of its statements, the market value
</p>
<p>of the common stock has constantly increased and is still
</p>
<p>increasing.
</p>
<p>But let us pursue this very important inquiry. Did
</p>
<p>the Trustees understand the effect of their own resolution?
</p>
<p>It is very evident that Mr. James J. Hill understood it, for
</p>
<p>he did not lose one moment to prove that he understood it
</p>
<p>by his actions. The whole thing was disposed of very
</p>
<p> shortly at the last annual meeting. Messrs. Hill, Rhawn and
</p>
<p>Drake held a conference apart, Judge Clark assisting. In
</p>
<p>about ve minutes the conference broke up. Mr. Rhawn
</p>
<p>returned to the Presidents chair. Judge Drake, who had
</p>
<p>offered the resolution, ofciated over its remains. With a
</p>
<p>countenance full of pity for the common stockholders who
</p>
<p>had stood in their own light, and with a sarcastic remark
</p>
<p>on the astounding revelations of the protest, Judge
</p>
<p>Drake suggested that it should be laid over to the next meet-
</p>
<p>ing. For the preservation of their property the common

</p>
<p>stockholders, as a body, are entirely and exclusively in-
</p>
<p>debted to the prompt, intelligent and honorable action of
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>Mr. James J. Hill, President of the Manitoba road, for Mr.
</p>
<p>'Rhawn and Judge Drake intended to carry the resolution
</p>
<p>by the brute force of the three to one vote of the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders, and by the proxies which had been obtained
</p>
<p>from the common stockholders by methods hereinbefore
</p>
<p>suggested. If Judge Clark had not differed from Judge
</p>
<p>Drake as to the power of a majority to vote themselves the
</p>
<p>property of the minority, the resolution would have been
</p>
<p>passed.
</p>
<p>The very mixed legal notions of Judge Drake and Mr.
</p>
<p>Rhawn on this subject may be readily explained. Both of
</p>
<p>them had been resident in the West at some portion of their
</p>
<p>lives and had heard of a mans  voting himself a farm.
</p>
<p>They forgot that this is a local custompurely. localas
</p>
<p>much so as gavel-kind was local to Kent. In the wildest West
</p>
<p>it was never understood as extending even to town lots, much
</p>
<p>less to property like railroad shares. If it is set up against
</p>
<p>this that Directors sometimes vote themselves mortgage
</p>
<p>bonds, and income bonds, and preferred stock, and the Lord
</p>
<p>knows what; that is all very true, but the line must be
</p>
<p>drawn somewhere, and I am inclined to draw it right here,
</p>
<p>and conne these privileges strictly to Directors. The Courts
</p>
<p>may wink at such things when Directors do them, but stock-
</p>
<p>holdersNON ever.
</p>
<p>It would seem that Messrs. Drake and Rhawn must have
</p>
<p>voted for the resolution on some such idea as this, because
</p>
<p>' they certainly knew what its effect would be, and though it
</p>
<p>is a little singular that a man of Judge Drakes intelligence
</p>
<p>should have been misled by this vague reminiscence of a
</p>
<p>custom prevailing on the border in his early days, yet it is
</p>
<p>the only way in which I can account for his advocacy of
</p>
<p>the resolution, and for persisting in it after he had been in-
</p>
<p>structed as to its inevitable results. Let us see now how
</p>
<p>much he knew about it. '

<p>one of the Trustees, making some suggestions as to the

<p>42
</p>
<p>effect of the resolution on the interests of the common

</p>
<p>LETTER or ONE OF THE TRUSTEES.
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C., june 5, 1886.
</p>
<p>jonN O. SARGENT, Esq,
</p>
<p>New York.
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, I have received your communication of 3d instant, and
</p>
<p>answer it with pleasure; though, I confess, not with much condence
</p>
<p>in my ability to remove from your mind views which I deem erro-
</p>
<p>neous if it be, as I have heard it is, that you are the writer of certain
</p>
<p>letters in the Railroad Record signed  An Old Subscriber.  Never-
</p>
<p>theless Ill say my say, whether it will satisfy you or not. (1.)
</p>
<p>In the rst place, I state the factwhich I think you will feel
</p>
<p>bound to admitthat the preferred stockholders of the St. Paul and
</p>
<p>Duluth Railroad Company have not a dollar of pecuniary interest in
</p>
<p>the adoption by the stockholders of the propositions submitted to their
</p>
<p>vote by the Board of Directors, unless their adoption Should have the
</p>
<p>effect of enhancing the market value of the preferred stock, which I do
</p>
<p>not think it would. (2.)
</p>
<p>The market value of that stock depends simply on the assured
</p>
<p>seven per cent. dividend; and that will certainly continue to be paid
</p>
<p>whether those propositions be adopted or not. Hence I have no
</p>
<p>interest in the matter of their adoption which can pervert or cloud my
</p>
<p>judgment. (3.)
</p>
<p>In the second place, you will pardon me for saying that you have
</p>
<p>fallen into gravely erroneous conclusions on this subject, because you
</p>

</p>
<p>Public Domain / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd
</p>
<p>have suffered your mind to rest upon erroneous premises. You say :
</p>
<p>AS I understand the preamble'and resolutions, they appropriate
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>the entire net income, to an indenite amount, and for an indenite
</p>
<p>period, to additions and improvements to the road.
</p>
<p>How it is possible that a man of your age and intelligence could
</p>
<p>have got so wrong about so plain a matter, written down so plainly as
</p>
<p>it is in those propositions, I am wholly at a loss to comprehend.
</p>
<p>Those propositions make no such appropriation, as you cannot
</p>
<p>help seeing if you will read them over again. (4.)
</p>
<p>You will see that the authority to suspend relates simply and
</p>
<p>solely to the purchase or drawing of preferred stock ; and that the
</p>
<p>authority to apply net proceeds relates simply and solely to the net
</p>
<p>proceeds from stumpage and the sales of lands. (5.)
</p>
<p>There is not, to my mind, a word there which  appropriates the
</p>
<p>entire net income * * * to additions and improvements
</p>
<p>to the road; but only an authority to  apply the net proceeds from
</p>
<p>stumpage and the sales of lands, not required in paying dividends upon
</p>
<p>preferred stock, to * * * improvements, additions and
</p>
<p>betterments; instead of applying it, as the plan of reorganization
</p>
<p>requires, to buying up preferred stock.
</p>
<p>But I think I see what leads your mind to the conclusions you
</p>
<p>have expressed. You seem to think that because these propositions do
</p>
<p>not pledge or contemplate the use of the net earnings of the railroad
</p>
<p>to paythe six per cent. to the common stockholders, therefore those
</p>
<p>stockholders will suffer. (6.)
</p>
<p>This is an entire mistake. No such pledge was necessary, for the
</p>
<p>all-sufficient reason that the plan of reorganization settles the rights of
</p>
<p>the common stockholders in the  net earnings of the railroad, and
</p>
<p>these propositions do not attempt to unsettle that matter, except to
</p>
<p>authorize a larger dividend to them out of those earnings than the plan
</p>
<p>contemplates. (7.) _
</p>
<p>But perhaps the fourth proposition may aect your mind by the
</p>
<p>use of the words,  Such suspension of the application of the net in-
</p>
<p>come.  If so, let me call your attention to the fact, clear as light,
</p>
<p>that  such suspension  cannot possibly be held to refer to any but
</p>
<p>the suspension authorized in the rst proposition; and that  the net
</p>
<p>income  can by no fair construction be considered to mean anything

</p>
<p>but the net income  from stumpage and the sales of lands.  (8.)
</p>
<p>But when you say that  it certainh/ is the efect of these resolutions
</p>
<p>to withdraw the common stock entirely from the protection of the plan,
</p>
<p>you seem to have wandered into error almost past recovery. I have
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>been more than fty years engaged in the study, practice and adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of the law, and, speaking judicially, I cannot see how you could
</p>
<p>in any fairness have taken up such an idea. (9.)
</p>
<p>Please read the propositions again, and observe that their only
</p>
<p>effect, adverse to the common stockholders, is the postponement for a
</p>
<p>time of the retirement of the preferred stock. (10.)
</p>
<p>In every other respect the common stockholders, if the proposition
</p>
<p>should be adopted, will stand in precisely the position they do now,
</p>
<p>except that they may receive increased dividends. Is that a reason for
</p>
<p>them to oppose the propositions? (1 1.)
</p>
<p>Now, admitting the slightly adverseeffect of that postponement, I
</p>
<p>set off against it the immediate benet to all stockholders of putting the
</p>
<p>road at the earliest practicable moment in the best possible condition
</p>
<p>for meeting the daily increasing demands of business. The sooner
</p>
<p>that is done the sooner the common stockholders will begin to receive
</p>
<p>dividends, and the larger will the dividends be. (1 2.)
</p>
<p>I say, without fear of successful contradiction, that the propositions
</p>
<p>to be voted on have not one single element of benet to the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders, except the hardly appreciable one resulting from the
</p>
<p>temporary postponement of the retirement of the preferred stock. (13).
</p>
<p>I say further, with equal condence, that the adoption of the propo-
</p>
<p>sitions is most clearly for the benet of the common stockholders, both
</p>
<p>as to the nearness and magnitude of dividends and as to the ultimate
</p>
<p>value of the property. (14.)
</p>
<p>If they see t to coincide in your erroneous views, and reject the
</p>
<p>propositions, the result will be that the road must be for years, as it is
</p>
<p>now, unt to meet efciently the demands of increasing business; and
</p>
<p>the inevitab e effect of that will be possibly at an early day, to lead to
</p>
<p>the construction of a parallel road, and probably more than one. (1 5.)
</p>
<p>The result of this must be, in a high degree, injurious to the common
</p>
<p>stockholders. They can get no dividends, except out of the balance
</p>
<p>of the net earnings of the railroad, after the payment of seven per cent.
</p>
<p>on the preferred stock. With the railroad crippled by refusing to put
</p>
<p>and keep it in a state of full efciency, and with the proceeds of stump-
</p>
<p>age and sales of lands at the same time necessarily and steadily

<p>diminishing, where will the common stockholders dividends be? I
</p>
<p>leave you to work out that problem. (16.)
</p>
<p>You speak about a lawsuit. Of course those who choose are at
</p>
<p>perfect liberty to indulge in that somewhat expensive luxury. ' But .
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>when the matter comes into the Courts, I think I can venture to
</p>
<p>promise that it will be found much easier to allege than prove that, in
</p>
<p>the management of the affairs of the Company, the common stock-
</p>
<p>. holders have been wronged to the amount of a single cent. 17.)
</p>
<p>' Yours truly, _ C. D. DRAKE.
</p>
<p>(1.) This proves that the Judge had seen and read the
</p>
<p>letters signed  An Old Subscriber, in the Railroad Record,
</p>
<p>but it does not prove who wrote them.
</p>
<p>(2.) I can by no means admit that the preferred stock-
</p>
<p>holders have not a dollar of pecuniary interest in the
</p>
<p>adoption of the propositions. One of the propositions was
</p>
<p>in the words following,_to wit:
</p>
<p> ThirdAny surplus of net earnings of the railroad which may
</p>
<p>remain after paying a dividend of seven per cent. upon preferred
</p>
<p>stock and a like dividend upon the common stock, shall he dz'oz'ded
</p>
<p>equally upon hoth classes of stock. 
</p>
<p>By the terms of the plan, the dividend to the preferred
</p>
<p>stock can never exceed seven per cent. Suppose that in
</p>
<p>1886 the railroad earned ten (10) per cent., it would be one
</p>
<p>and a half per cent. additional. How then can one feel
</p>
<p>bound to admit that the preferred stockholders have not a
</p>
<p>dollar of pecuniary interest in the adoption of the proposi-
</p>
<p>tions? That is a bluff that might mislead the average
</p>
<p>stockholder, but was not it presuming a little too much on
</p>
<p>the prestige of an ex-judgeship to suppose that it was going
</p>
<p>to pose a lawyer so advanced as to be able to say that he
</p>
<p>had enjoyed the honor of shaking hands with Chief-Justice
</p>
<p>Marshall on an introduction by Mr. Justice Story?
</p>
<p>(3.) About market values and the causes that affect them
</p>
<p>I do. not pretend to know anything; but my impression is
</p>
<p>that if Messrs. Drake and Rhawn had forced the adop-
</p>
<p>tion of the proposition above quoted, the property'they
</p>
<p>thus voted themselves would have been placed in twenty-
</p>
<p>four hourslor as soon thereafter as Counsel could be heard
</p>
<p>-under the protection of Commissioners appointed by the

</p>
<p>Circuit Court of the United States, Minnesota District, sit-
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>ting in equity. This is my opinion. I will not be so un-
</p>
<p>courteous as to point out to Judge Drake the precise
</p>
<p>amount of pecuniary interest that would have attached to
</p>
<p>his own holdings. He can easily calculate it on the gures
</p>
<p>I have furnished above.
</p>
<p>(4.) Again, I am compelled to differ. I have read the
</p>
<p>propositions again, and I can help seeing.
</p>
<p>(5.) Again, I must say that I do not see what the Judge
</p>
<p>says I will see.
</p>
<p>(6.) I not only seem to think, but I do think, that for the
</p>
<p>reason that the propositions neither pledge nor contemplate
</p>
<p>the use of the net earnings to pay the six per cent. to the
</p>
<p>common stockholders, therefore these stockholders would
</p>
<p>suffer. Of course they would suffer. The plan it seems is
</p>
<p> all sufcient for them. The plan secures their interest in
</p>
<p>the net earnings--and by a change in book-keeping
</p>
<p>methods the  net earnings are absorbed by the Corpora-
</p>
<p>tion. - -
</p>
<p>(7.) The propositions do not and cannot authorize a
</p>
<p>larger dividend. Such a claim is merely a device to hood-
</p>
<p>wink the average stockholder. All income from all sources
</p>
<p>after paying seven per cent. to the lien-holders accrues to
</p>
<p>the uses of the common stockholders. What nonsense it is
</p>
<p>to talk about giving them a larger dividend than all.
</p>
<p>(8.) I certainly opine that by a fair construction of the
</p>
<p>fourth proposition it may be held to apply to all the net
</p>
<p>income. Think a moment. You say that the  suspension
</p>
<p>spoken of can only refer to the suspension of the applica-
</p>
<p>tion 0f stumpage. Be it so. Then there is no provision for
</p>
<p>the suspension of the third clause which provides for giving
</p>
<p>the preferred stockholders three-fths\of the surplus earn-
</p>
<p>ings of the railroad. T lzat is never to be suspended. The
</p>
<p>three to one vote is never to be suspended. It is  clear as
</p>
<p>light then that the Directors are never to be suspended;
</p>
<p>and that would be the most desirable suspension that I can

</p>
<p>imagine. O! Judge, Judge, how could you experiment in
</p>
<p>the hope of getting any stockholders but uncommonly
</p>
<p>green ones into such a trap as this.
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>(9.) If you can tell me what is left of the plan or of the
</p>
<p>common stockholders after they have made the lien-hold-
</p>
<p>ers perpetual stockholders with a vote of three to one, and
</p>
<p>an absolute power of disposing as they see t of all the in-
</p>
<p>come of the trust, then I will frankly confess that you have
</p>
<p>proted marvelloust by your fty years practice of the law,
</p>
<p>and are entitled to speak judicially even in a case of your
</p>
<p>own.
</p>
<p>(10.) I have read the propositions again and I dont ob-
</p>
<p>serve itvery much to the contrary.
</p>
<p>(11.) Heaven knows that the common stockholders
</p>
<p>would be very glad to receive any sort of dividends, in-
</p>
<p>creased or otherwise. No dividend can be imagined that
</p>
<p>would not be an . increase on what they have been receiv-
</p>
<p>ing. No, no, we do not oppose the propositions because
</p>
<p>they increase our dividends. That would not be a sensible
</p>
<p>reason. Just try us with dividends, and see if we would
</p>
<p>oppose them.
</p>
<p>(12.) By all means keep the road in a rst-rate condi-
</p>
<p>tion; pay us what the net earnings entitle us to under
</p>
<p>any honest system of book-keeping; get your money for
</p>
<p>improvements at ve per cent. instead of seven; be virtuous
</p>
<p>and you will be happy. But dont for mercys sake imagine
</p>
<p>that we are such idiots as to think that we are going to earn
</p>
<p>larger dividends by giving away three-fths of our prop-
</p>
<p>erty.
</p>
<p>(13.) If you will read over again what I have written
</p>
<p>above, I think you will not reassert this proposition  with_
</p>
<p>out fear of successful contradiction.
</p>
<p>_ (14.) Well, you have expended all the money just the
</p>
<p>same as if the propositions had been adopted; just the same
</p>
<p>exactly. We ought to have a dividend of nearness and
</p>
<p>magnitude, unless you propose to carry out the scheme of
</p>
<p>' voting yourself three-fths of the prots of the property. '
</p>
<p>(15.) If with the four millions of money put up by the

</p>
<p>common stockholders the road is in such a condition as you
</p>
<p>describe, it is very certain that it can never be resuscitated
</p>
<p>by a policy that seeks to perpetuate a seven per cent. in-
</p>
<p>cumbrance.
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>The only hope of the common stockholders must be in
</p>
<p>saving the unnecessary hundred thousand dollars paid to
</p>
<p>the men who are bamboozling them.
</p>
<p>(16.) The common stockholders do not complain that
</p>
<p>they can get no dividend except out of net earnings.
</p>
<p>What exasperates them is that they cannot get any dividend
</p>
<p>out of net earnings. And to such shabby devices have
</p>
<p>the Management resorted to evade our demands, that they
</p>
<p>have absolutely changed their methods of book-keeping in
</p>
<p>order to cover up the fact that they have money which, un-
</p>
<p>der the plan in its honest execution, is pledged to divi-
</p>
<p>dends and retirement. We are not so much interested in
</p>
<p>the question as to where the common stockholders divi-
</p>
<p>dends will he at some future time; what we want to know
</p>
<p>is how to get at them. We know where they; are; they
</p>
<p>are in the hands of the Corporation. The Corporation has
</p>
<p>four millions of our money not represented by anything
</p>
<p>that certies to our interest in them. We want those cer-
</p>
<p>ticates, and we want them now; we do not wish to put
</p>
<p>off till to-morrow what ought to be done today. We want
</p>
<p>a forty per cent.dividend for the two millions of our com-
</p>
<p>mon stock in the treasury, and we do not wish to see this
</p>
<p>distribution put off to the very remote period contemplated
</p>
<p>by the good Directors, when it will be too late for any of
</p>
<p>us to prot by it.
</p>
<p>(17.) A lawsuit is a very handy thing to have in the
</p>
<p>house sometimes. Mr. Baring-Wells has got a lawsuit
</p>
<p>pending at St. Paul. The answer is in and the replication
</p>
<p>led. If anybody should happen to be at St. Paul June 20th
</p>
<p>representing thirty or forty thousand shares of the common
</p>
<p>stock and request to be made a party to Mr. Baring-Wells
</p>
<p>bill, I think it would have a considerable~ moral effect on
</p>
<p>the Directors and on the Court. It is not unlikely that the
</p>
<p>Court would tell the Directors that they need not be in a
</p>
<p>hurry to pay a dividend on the $820,000 of spurious stock,

<p>or allow it to vote. There is no knowing but what it might
</p>
<p>tell them to go back to their old methods of book-keeping;
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>I think it would. Sauce for goose is sauce for gander,
</p>
<p>has always been good law in Minnesota. Indeed I am not
</p>
<p>sure but that a good lawsuit is well worth all it costs. I
</p>
<p>should hardly consider any luxury expensive that would
</p>
<p>enable one to examine the Judge as to his pecuniary inter-
</p>
<p>est in the passage of the bamboozling resolution.
</p>
<p>The receipt of this judicial letter was immediately ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged by Mr. Sargent, with the expression of his in
</p>
<p>tention to make a fuller reply at an early day. This was
</p>
<p>anticipated by the following letter from Judge Drake:
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, june 8, 1886.
</p>
<p>JOHN O. SARGENT,-Esq.
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, -In reply to your favor of yesterday, permit me to say
</p>
<p>that it can hardly be worth while for you to take the trouble of
</p>
<p>answering my letter in detail when the stockholders meeting is so near
</p>
<p>at hand.
</p>
<p>But let me add afew words to what I previously wrote.
</p>
<p>The printed slip inclosed by you shows the whole spirit of the
</p>
<p>common stockholders opposition to the propositions to be voted on.
</p>
<p>They want dividends now, without stopping to ask what is to be
</p>
<p>the effect on the future prosperity of the road of paying out in divi-
</p>
<p>dends what is imperatively required to put the road, at an early day,
</p>
<p>in a better condition to pay hotter dividends hereafter.
</p>
<p>They seem to be quite willing to sacrice the future to the mere
</p>
<p>present enjoyment of dividends that must, at best, be but small. They
</p>
<p>quite forget that the result must be to diminish greatly the capacity of
</p>
<p>the road to earn any dividends whatever for the common stockholders;
</p>
<p>to keep it in a condition of inability to meet the demands of business;
</p>
<p>and thereby to invite the building of another road alongside of it.
</p>
<p>If the common stockholders see t to take this course, be assured
</p>
<p>that they alone will suffer. Whether the propositions be adopted or
</p>
<p>not, the preferred stockholders will be sure to receive their seven per
</p>
<p>cent. Yours truly, C. D. DRAKE.
</p>
<p>The printed slip referred to in the above letter was an
</p>

<p>intelligent and active effort to depreciate the common stock
</p>
<p>by such argumentative suggestions as the following: What
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>H
</p>
<p>a fraud is Duluth common, Duluth common is a fraud,
</p>
<p>If these (the preferred stockholders) stand on the letter of
</p>
<p>_ their contract there is nothing in the common. Iannex
</p>
<p>the slipit is the same that Mr. Ward inclosed to Judge
</p>
<p>Drake in his letter printed in the appendix:
</p>
<p>[From the Financial Daib/ Record K), May 24, 1886.]
</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the St. Paul and Duluth will be held on
</p>
<p>june 21, when it is proposed to adopt the following resolutions [of 12th
</p>
<p>May]. -
</p>
<p>The effect of the passage of the above will be to defer indenitely
</p>
<p>all prospect of dividends upon the common stock. The average earn-
</p>
<p>ings from the railroad itself for the last seven years have been far below
</p>
<p>the amount required to pay dividends on the preferred stock. The
</p>
<p>resolutions will undoubtedly pass, for the preferred stock, amounting to
</p>
<p>$5,376,970 out of a total of $9,432,377, has a vote for every Share,
</p>
<p>while it requires three shares of the common to cast a single vote.
</p>
<p>This was no doubt the opinion of a railroad expert, who
</p>
<p>desired to give his readers the benet of his examination of
</p>
<p>the resolutions, coupled with his valuable interpretation of
</p>
<p>the contract. It should at least have induced Judge Drake
</p>
<p>to ask himself the question whether there was not something
</p>
<p>to justify Mr. Ward and Mr. Sargent in having arrived at
</p>
<p>the same conclusion that was reached by the nancial
</p>
<p>editor. Singularly enough the same result had been reached
</p>
<p>by a legal gentleman in Boston, who drew Mr. Rhawns
</p>
<p>attention to the point, and Mr. Rhawn replied that he
</p>
<p>thought the newspaper writer failed to understand, if he
</p>
<p>was not disingenuous. Here are four different persons,
</p>
<p>three of them lawyers, and one of them a nancial editor,
</p>
<p>communicating to Messrs. Rhawn and Drake a concurrent
</p>
<p>' opinion as to their understanding of the resolution, and
</p>
<p>their belief that it would defer indenitely all prospect of
</p>
<p>dividends upon the common stoch-and Messrs. Rhawn and
</p>
<p>Drake taking the very grave responsibility of voting the

<p>proxies of 20,000 common shares in favor of such a resolution,
</p>
<p>which they say they would have done had it not been  for
</p>
<p>the action of the twelve protesting stockholders. And
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>now, only one year afterwards, do you imagine it possible
</p>
<p>to scare up any .person cornpos rnentis who will read this.
</p>
<p>correspondence and doubt that Messrs. Rhawn and Drake
</p>
<p>knew this to be the effect of the resolution, and intended
</p>
<p>this to be the effect, and were prepared to use the proxies
</p>
<p>intrusted to them in a duciary capacity,_to accomplish this
</p>
<p> detrimental result.
</p>
<p>And how does Judge Drake meet the opinion of the
</p>
<p>nancial editor? Does he say that if the resolution is liable
</p>
<p>to the objection stated it ought to be amended to obviate
</p>
<p>the objection? Not at all. He merely says that if the com-
</p>
<p>mon stockholders see t to oppose the resolutions to be
</p>
<p>voted on, which they honestly believe defer  indenitely all
</p>
<p>prospect of dividend,  they alone will suffer, and in sub-
</p>
<p>stance that he does not care much if they do as long as the
</p>
<p>preferred stockholders will be sure to receive their (7)
</p>
<p>seven per cent.
</p>
<p>Thus far we have got through with the Judge, and the
</p>
<p>Vice-President is next in order. What lshould want to
</p>
<p>learn of Mr. Rhawn would be about the responsibility of
</p>
<p>Mr. Sargent for non-payment of a dividend to the common
</p>
<p>stockholders. After the meeting of the stockholders on the
</p>
<p>21st June last, a night telegram was dispatched to the
</p>
<p>- Railroad Record of Philadelphia from St. Paul, stating as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>The resolutions submitted by the Directors on May 12th were
</p>
<p>postponed till the next annual meeting. The effect of this will be
</p>
<p>that improvements will have to be made from the railroads earnings,
</p>
<p>and the proceeds of land and stumpage will be required to make up
</p>
<p>the dividends upon the preferred stock, so that no dividend can at
</p>
<p>present he paid upon the common stock. Mr. John O. Sargent, of
</p>
<p>New York, opposed the passage of the resolutions, and although there
</p>
<p>was a majority present favoring their passage, it was deemed best to
</p>
<p>postpone them. 
</p>
<p>It was natural enough that in the course of the summer,

</p>
<p>in view of this statement, Mr. Sargent should receive several
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>letters from common stockholders inquiring why he should
</p>
<p>be such a bad man as to prevent the good Mr. Rhawn from
</p>
<p>making dividends to the long-suffering common stockholder,
</p>
<p>when he would have done so if Mr. Sargent had not inter-
</p>
<p>fered. As this became an annoyance, Mr. Sargent addressed
</p>
<p>to the Vice-President this letter:
</p>
<p>, LENOX, Mass, October 8, 1886.
</p>
<p>WM. H. RHAWN, Esq.,
</p>
<p>Vice-President S. D.
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:
</p>
<p>In the Railroad Record of 26th June, and in the same journal of the
</p>
<p>10th of july, the managers of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad single
</p>
<p>me out from a dozen dissenting stockholders, and charge that common 
</p>
<p>stockholders desiring dividends may thank me for their not receiving
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>The managers by their report of August 2d show that they have re-
</p>
<p>_ ceived a lage sum of money applicable to the payment of dividends
</p>
<p>upon the common stock which has been applied by the Trustees to the
</p>
<p>uses of the Corporation. .
</p>
<p>It shows also that a large sum of money that came into the hands
</p>
<p>of the Trustees from the sale of lands and stumpage has also been ap-
</p>
<p>plied to the uses of the Corporation,_and not to the purposes contem-
</p>
<p>plated by the Trust.
</p>
<p>Now will you kindly inform me what agency you impute to me in
</p>
<p>bringing about this result? When you applied all the net income of the
</p>
<p>trust to the uses of the Corporation, please explain the process by
</p>
<p>which you justify the statement to the public that the common stock-
</p>
<p>holders of S. D. may thank Mr. Sargent for not receiving their divi-
</p>
<p>dend P
</p>
<p>I opposed, in my own interest, as I had a perfect right to do, with-
</p>
<p>out subjecting myself to personal attack in the public prints, a proposi-
</p>
<p>tion to give a large portion of the property of the S. D. to the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders without any consideration, and you may be assured that
</p>
<p>I shall continue to oppose it. But I submit that the managers have
</p>
<p>no right to withhold dividends due the common stockholders, and al-

<p>lege that I am responsible for the default. Presuming you are able to
</p>
<p>show how the common stockholders would have received a dividend if
</p>
<p>the twelve common stockholders had not interposed by defeating the
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>extraordinary and unprecedented donation to the preferred stock-
</p>
<p>_ holders contemplated by the resolution,

<p>I remain, very truly yours,

<p>JOHN O. SARGENT.

<p>Mr. Rhawn replied to this respectful application in an
</p>
<p>epistle that explains itself :
</p>
<p>SAINT PAUL AND DULUTH RAILROAD COMPANY.
</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA, October 12, 1886.
</p>
<p>SIR,As this Company is in no way responsible for what the
</p>
<p>editor of any journal may see t to say in his paper, and cannot as-
</p>
<p>sume to control the expression of individual opinion of any of its
</p>
<p>managers, I must respectfully decline to enter into the discussion to
</p>
<p>which you invite me in your letter of the 8th inst.
</p>
<p>Respectfully, W. H. RHAWN,
</p>
<p>]0HN O. SARGENT, Esq., Lenox, Mass. Vice-President.
</p>
<p>It is clear that Mr. Sargent merely called upon Mr.
</p>
<p>Rhawn to relieve himself from the odium of the charge
</p>
<p>that by his meddlesome interference he had deprived the
</p>
<p>common stockholders of dividends they would otherwise
</p>
<p>have received. This was hardly a fair statement of the case
</p>
<p>against Mr. Sargent, and in view of his frank and courteous
</p>
<p>call for an explanation, I cannot help thinking that Mr.
</p>
<p>Rhawn ought to have replied in a less curt and abrupt
</p>
<p>manner. Clear it is certainly that Mr. Sargent did not
</p>
<p>invite Mr. Rhawn to any discussion whatever. He simply
</p>
<p>desired to give Mr. Rhawn the opportunity of withdrawing
</p>
<p>in a cooler moment the charge that he had unwisely made '
</p>
<p>in a moment of chagrin and disappointment, for it was an
</p>
<p>awful disappointment to Mr. Rhawn that he was compelled
</p>
<p>to telegraph such  tidings of despair to his favorite organ.
</p>
<p>He expected to telegraph that the resolution was passed
</p>
<p> unanimously as usual; that he had betrayed the common
</p>
<p>stockholders with their own proxies; that they were out of
</p>
<p>sight of any dividend for years to come; and that the pre-

</p>
<p>ferred stock was established permanently with a triple vote.
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>It was a shocking come-down to be obliged to confess that
</p>
<p>the tail had wagged the dog, and that it was the most re-
</p>
<p>markable instance on record in which such a feat had been
</p>
<p>accomplished. Indeed there has prevailed hitherto a certain
</p>
<p>degree of skepticism as to the possibility of such a perform-
</p>
<p>ance, and I believe this is the rst time that it has ever
</p>
<p>been vouched for by an entirely ingenuous andtruthful
</p>
<p>eye-witness.
</p>
<p>But I have another valuable letter from Mr. Rhawn, writ-
</p>
<p>ten in reply to a gentleman who sought some explanation
</p>
<p>of the resolution, which had seemed to him very extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary. The Board is proceeding upon the theory, writes
</p>
<p>the Vice-President, that money in no wise applicable to
</p>
<p>the payment of dividends upon the common stock used for
</p>
<p>necessary improvements will increase earnings of the road
</p>
<p>and hasten dividends on the common stock.
</p>
<p>It is surprising how soon a really capable business man
</p>
<p>can become muddled when he begins to theorize. Here is
</p>
<p>Mr. Rhawn starting a theory, to be sure. Why does not
</p>
<p>he stick to facts and terra rrna, and not be getting into the
</p>
<p>clouds with his conceits and whimseys. The very rst thing
</p>
<p>a man ought to do when he sets up a theory  is to be sure
</p>
<p>of his facts. If he has not got the facts for his theory he
</p>
<p>might as well set up a coach without horses. Now the
</p>
<p>whole theory  of the Board rests upon the fancy that
</p>
<p>there is somehow, somewhere, money accruing to the Cor-
</p>
<p>poration that is in no wise applicable to the payment of divi-
</p>
<p>dends upon the common stock. This is a favorite theory
</p>
<p>of the Vice-President, thrown out often in very choice italics
</p>
<p>in the Railroad Record. The only trouble is that THERE IS
</p>
<p>No SUCH MONEY. That knocks the theory of the Board
</p>
<p>into a cooked hat, to say the least. After paying 7 per
</p>
<p>cent. to the preferred stockholders, every dollar that accrues
</p>
<p>to the Corporation is due in dividends to the common
</p>
<p>stockholderrst, in cash to him in hand paid, and

</p>
<p>secondly, in the cash applied to the retirement of the pre-
</p>
<p>ferred stock.
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>I must refer once more to the allegation of the Answer
</p>
<p>that a majority of the holders of the common stock of
</p>
<p>said defendant Corporation, present at said meeting in
</p>
<p>person or by proxy, actually favored the adoption, then
</p>
<p>and there, of said proposed change of plan.
</p>
<p>That is true, and the reader is now fully informed as to
</p>
<p>the methods employed by men standing in duciary rela-
</p>
<p>tions to these common stockholders to secure those proxies.
</p>
<p>The answer might have added, as the Management said in
</p>
<p>their report in the Record, that but for the action of the
</p>
<p>twelve protesting stockholders, representing only 1,278
</p>
<p>votes out of the 46,180 votes represented at the meeting,
</p>
<p>the resolutions would have been legally adopted hy a unanimous
</p>
<p>vote. It is said that 23,341 shares of common stock, consti-
</p>
<p>tuting a majority, were in favor of the unanimous adoption
</p>
<p>of the resolution pressed by 38,352 preferred stockholders,
</p>
<p>and that all this array was sat upon by a little bit of paper
</p>
<p>led by one dozen common stockholders, containing a few
</p>
<p>unintelligible observations dictated to a typewriter half an
</p>
<p>hour before the meeting.
</p>
<p>The common stockholders now feel and understand how
</p>
<p>very narrow their escape has been, and they would not
</p>
<p>have escaped at all if it had not been that Mr. James J. Hill
</p>
<p>promptly denounced the outrage, and put his foot on it, as
</p>
<p>the answer emphatically observes, then and there. To
</p>
<p>his excellent sense and sterling honesty the common stock-
</p>
<p>holders understand that they are indebted for saving the
</p>
<p>larger portion of their valuable property.
</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to discuss the propositions adopted
</p>
<p>by the Directors on the 5th of February, 1887. They will
</p>
<p>be defeated for obvious reasons. My impression is that at
</p>
<p>the next meeting of the stockholders it will not be the Vice-
</p>
<p>President in the chair, with President Fisher on a stool by
</p>
<p>his side; but it will be President Fisher in the chair with
</p>
<p>the Vice-President on the stool by his side, and it will be a

<p>stool of repentance.

<p>In conclusion, I would merely add from the recent cir-

</p>
<p>CORRESPONDENCE THAT EXPLAINS ITSELF.

<p>No. I.
</p>
<p>HON. JOHN E. WARD T0 HON. C. D. DRAKE.
</p>
<p>NEW YORK, May 27, 1886..
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, A number of my clients have received powers of attorney
</p>
<p>in the matter of the St. Paul and Duluth, and a letter requesting their
</p>
<p>proxies. As your name appears in the power sent them, I take the
</p>
<p>liberty of renewing an old acquaintance in this way for the want of a
</p>
<p>personal opportunity.
</p>
<p>Some time in February last I was consulted by several clients who
</p>
<p>had long held interests, both as preferred and common stockholders,
</p>
<p>and my attention was called to an article in the Philadelphia Railroad
</p>
<p>Record, coming from a distinguished jurist who had been long an ad-
</p>
<p>viser of the Company. When I received the power with your name in
</p>
<p>it, it naturally occurred to me that you were the gentleman referred to.
</p>
<p>Now as I would willingly advise my clients to send their proxies to a
</p>
<p>gentleman in whom I have such entire condence, I desire only that
</p>
<p>you will give me your condence to the extent of an early reply to a
</p>
<p>few suggestions. 
</p>
<p>In the letter referred to, you admit the right of the common stock-
</p>
<p>holders to inquire into dividends, and you express the opinion that if
</p>
<p>injustice in any way had been done to them, it would not be necessary
</p>
<p>to resort to litigation to secure their equities.
</p>
<p>In the March number of the same journal there is an article com-
</p>
<p>menting on some advice which I had given to my clients pointing out
</p>
<p>to them the remedies in their power for the protection of their equitable

</p>
<p>rights.
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>In this article-and I will not affect to consider it anything else
</p>
<p>than as a paper by one having authority to speak, and not by a mere
</p>
<p>scribethe writer says, speaking of a distribution of preferred stOck
</p>
<p>that had already taken place:  If there should ever be any'question.
</p>
<p>as to what may be due the common stockholders, the precedent has
</p>
<p>been established and may doubtless be settled in the same way.
</p>
<p>I drew the natural inference from these expressions that at least the
</p>
<p>legal adviser and the Vice-President were disposed to do justice in the
</p>
<p>premises.
</p>
<p>But when I see them soliciting proxies for the resolutions recom-
</p>
<p>mendedat the Directors meeting of May 12th, conrming the past use
</p>
<p>of the stumpage and land money, without any compensation to the
</p>
<p>common stockholders for its diversion from the uses contemplated
</p>
<p>by the plan of reorganization, and the future use of the same to an
</p>
<p>unlimited amount and for an indenite period with no compensation,
</p>
<p>I confess that I cannot comprehend it. .
</p>
<p>I consider those resolutions in the highest degree  detrimental
</p>
<p>to the common stockholders. That they are so regarded by others I
</p>
<p>infer from an editorial article written with the evident purpose of adding
</p>
<p>to the injury contemplated by the resolutions, from the New York
</p>
<p>Financial Daily Record of May 27th:  The effect of the passage of the
</p>
<p>above will be to defer indenitely all prospect of dividends upon the
</p>
<p>common stock.
</p>
<p>I think no other conclusion can be drawn from them. They pro-
</p>
<p>vide for the preferred stockholders only. In writing you thus, if I
</p>
<p>presume too much on the privileged relations among members of the
</p>
<p>profession, I trust you will pardon me from the large interests my
</p>
<p>clients have in the premises, and my solicitude to give them the best
</p>
<p>advice.
</p>
<p>If there is no intention to consider the equities of the common
</p>
<p>stockholders and to  settle them in the same way as they were settled
</p>
<p>for the preferred, it seems to me that litigation is inevitable.
</p>
<p>I see a decision of judge Wallace in the papers to-day, that has an
</p>
<p>important bearing on the contemplated action of the stockholders.
</p>
<p>Very truly yours,

</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, -Though, after my interview with you day before yester-
</p>
<p>day, it is not worth while for me to answer your letter of 29th ult., yet
</p>
<p>I feel it worth while to say a few words to you in writing, the purport
</p>
<p>of which I said when I saw you. '
</p>
<p>I am so thoroughly convinced that some of the common stock-
</p>
<p>holders of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad Company are laboring
</p>
<p>under a great misapprehension in regard to the effect on their interests
</p>
<p>of the adoption of the propositions to be voted on the 21st inst., and
</p>
<p>that the rejection of those propositions will result in serious injury to
</p>
<p>them, that I greatly desire that there should be no failure on their part
</p>
<p>to send to St. Paul, in advance of the annual meeting, some intelligent
</p>
<p>and fair-minded men to investigate the whole matter. So far as I am
</p>
<p>concerned I wish that a thorough investigation should be made, If
</p>
<p>there has been any wrong in the management of the Company I know
</p>
<p>nothing of it; if there has not been, I want the stockholders to
</p>
<p>know it. Yours truly, C. D. DRAKE.

<p>61 WALL STREET,

<p>NEW YORK, June 4, 1886.
</p>
<p>MY DEAR JUDGE, I am this morning in receipt of your kind favor
</p>
<p>of yesterday, for which please accept my thanks. I am sure I need not
</p>
<p>say to you that if there has been wrong in the management of the
</p>
<p>Company you knew nothing of it, and all those I represent I will
</p>
<p>impress with this view. -
</p>
<p>The more difcult task for me to impress upon them is that the
</p>
<p>common stockholders have not been greatly wronged in the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of the Company, and that by the contemplated proceeding their
</p>
<p>rights are not to be entirely ignored and sacriced. Intelligent and
</p>
<p>fair-minded men will however be on the spot prepared, I think, to
</p>
<p>give all matters fair and candid investigation.

</p>
<p>[ Judge Drakes request in regard to the intelligent and fair-minded
</p>
<p>men was complied with and the result was this protest, which so
</p>
<p>astonished the Directors that they could not understand it, They
</p>
<p>were not only unable to understand, but they said it prevented them
</p>
<p>from paying any dividend to the common stockholders till they were
</p>
<p>all dead and gone]
</p>
<p>PROTEST OF A PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCKHOLDER.
</p>
<p>Whereas, there are now accrued, subject to the uses of the com-
</p>
<p>mon stockholders of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad Company,
</p>
<p>moneys exceeding half a million dollars, and of the funds now accru-
</p>
<p>ing and to accrue from all sources, subject exclusively to the same
</p>
<p>uses, it is proposed to apply at least half a million more to the uses of
</p>
<p>the Company, making in all more than a million of dollars, to the
</p>
<p>benet of which the common stockholders are exclusively entitled; 
</p>
<p>which it is proposed to convert to the uses of the Company without
</p>
<p>allowing to said individual common stockholders one dollar of com-
</p>
<p>pensation.
</p>
<p>And, whereas, of the said million dollars, a portion is applicable
</p>
<p>to the retirement of the preferred stock at par, which retirement is ad-
</p>
<p>verse to the interests of said preferred stockholders, and its diversion
</p>
<p>to the uses of the Company is a great benet to them, as it defers the
</p>
<p>extinguishment of their stock as provided in the plan; and, while no
</p>
<p>compensation is made to the common stockholders for diverting a
</p>
<p>million of their own money from the uses of the trust, certain resolu
</p>
<p>tions submitted by the Directors this day, propose to compensate the
</p>
<p>preferred stockholders for submitting to this benet by giving them,
</p>
<p>forever, 55 per cent. of the net earnings of the railroad, which said
</p>
<p>gift, so generously proposed to be made by the preferred stockholders
</p>
<p>to themselves, is just so much over and above 7 per cent. to which the
</p>
<p>mortgage interest is expressly limited by the deed of conveyance and
</p>
<p>the contract of the parties. '
</p>
<p>And, whereas, this is, perhaps, the largest usury that was ever paid
</p>
<p>by any party on his own money for the privilege of having it applied
</p>
<p>to other peoples uses.

</p>
<p>Therefore, the undersigned, a preferred and common stockholder
</p>
<p>of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad Company, desires to le this, his
</p>
<p>protest, and to enter the same on the minutes of this meeting, against '
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>the adoption of the resolutions, each and all, submitted by the Trustees
</p>
<p>and Directors, and against any action on the same as being beyond the
</p>
<p>powers~ of this meeting.
</p>
<p>And he thus respectfully assigns the reasons for this protest.
</p>
<p>FirstBecause the resolutions directly impair the obligations of
</p>
<p>the Contract embodied in the plan of reorganization.
</p>
<p>SecondBecause they are founded on the false theory that the
</p>
<p>preferred stock is something  paramount and superior, intended by
</p>
<p>the parties to the contract to enjoy greater advantages and larger re-
</p>
<p>turns than the common stock; whereas the preferred stock is strictly
</p>
<p>and simply an incumbrance on the property of the common stock
</p>
<p>holders, to whose use the entire net income of lands and road, after
</p>
<p>' payment of 7 per cent. on the preferred stock,_ is expressly dedicated,
</p>
<p>and to none other, subject always to the lien of the preferred stock-
</p>
<p>holders.
</p>
<p>Thz'rd. --Because it was in view of this strict limitation of the rights
</p>
<p>of the preferred stockholders to 7 per cent. and liquidation, and the
</p>
<p>surrender of all claims to prots on the residuary net income, and to
</p>
<p>all accretions and additions to the property of the Company, except as
</p>
<p>a security, that the common stockholders allowed the triple vote to the
</p>
<p>preferred stockholders, for their protection while their lien was in the
</p>
<p>process of extinguishment.
</p>
<p>Fourth. Because all the obligations of the Company with regard
</p>
<p>to this lien, and all the rights of ,its holders being thus strictly dened
</p>
<p>and limited, any proposition to divide the net earnings of the railroad
</p>
<p>with the holders of the lien is totally irreconcilable with the nature of
</p>
<p>theirholdings and with the rights of the common stockholders.
</p>
<p>szthBecause the proposed temporary change in the plan is
</p>
<p>practically perpetual, as such disposition is made of the net income as
</p>
<p>to place the whole matter in the hands of the preferred stockholders
</p>
<p>with their triple vote.
</p>
<p>Sz'xth..-Because if, by a vote of the stockholders, the unchangeable
</p>
<p>plan can be changed at all, it can be changed entirely, and all the
</p>
<p>rights of the owners of the property can be thus placed at the disposal
</p>
<p>of the holders of the lien. '

</p>
<p> Because if the preferred stockholders can come together to-day and
</p>
<p>lawfully vote themselves, off-hand, fty-ve per cent. of the net earn-
</p>
<p>ings of the railroad, they can come together again to-morrow and vote -
</p>
<p>themselves the other forty-ve per cent, in spite of the protest of the
</p>
<p>_ minority. >
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>Because the contract of the preferred stockholders was for 7 per
</p>
<p>cent. and liquidation, and the contract of common stockholders was
</p>
<p>for 6 per cent. and the property, vwhich, with the franchises and land
</p>
<p>grant, and the road, with its extensions, additions, improvements and
</p>
<p>betterments, and all accretions to the property in which the moneys of
</p>
<p>the common stockholders have been invested, belong to the common
</p>
<p>stockholders, subject only to the lien of the preferred stockholders;
</p>
<p>and the common stockholders do not propose to be voted out of the
</p>
<p>same, or to part with their interests, except by a fair contract of bargain
</p>
<p>and sale.  jOHN O. SARGENT.

</p>
<p>[The report of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad Company for 1886
</p>
<p>states the results of the years operations as follows:
</p>
<p>Net earnings from the operation of the road,$6 30,790. 61. Receipts
</p>
<p>from land and stumpage sales, $16 3,057.73. The contract or the plan
</p>
<p>requires that after the payment of 7 (seven) per cent. to the preferred
</p>
<p>stockholders ($350,182) all the residue shall enure to the benet of the
</p>
<p>common stockholders; to wit (approximately) $240,000 in a six per
</p>
<p>cent. dividend on the common stock, and $163,057, with the $40,000
</p>
<p>surplus from the railroad earnings, to the retirement of the preferred
</p>
<p>stock. That is the contract, and can of course be enforced in the
</p>
<p>Courts. The Vice-President, being a very skillful book-keeper, con-
</p>
<p>ceived the ingenious, but somewhat extrordinary,idea that he could in-
</p>
<p>validate the obligations of this contract by changing his method of
</p>
<p>stating the results. He labors under the singular delusion that he can
</p>
<p>abrogate the contract by a book-keeping device. This is not possible.
</p>
<p>Even a sovereign State cannot do it. Here is Virginia, for instance, a
</p>

<p>No. VI.
</p>
<p>MR. SARGENT TO PRESIDENT Emma
</p>
<p>28 EAST 3 5TH STREET,
</p>
<p>WILLIAM H. FISHER, Esq, NEW YORK, April 30, 1887.
</p>
<p>President, etc.
</p>
<p>DEAR S1R,I avail myself of your kind intimation that you are
</p>
<p>gratied by an exhibition of interest in your management of the St.
</p>
<p>Paul and Duluth Railroad, and write again to make an inquiry that you
</p>
<p>will not consider impertinent in a holder of the stock of the Company.
</p>
<p>In Mr. Adams testimony before the Pacic Railroad Commission,
</p>
<p>reported in the Times this morning, I nd the following statement:
</p>
<p> Net earnings are reached by deducting the operating expenses from
</p>
<p>the gross earnings. This is the method employed by the Government
</p>
<p>and authorized by the Courts.
</p>
<p>In your report for 1886, you state the net earnings from the opera-
</p>
<p>tion of the road at $630,000. You reach this result by deducting the
</p>
<p>actual operating expenses, $927, 295.23, from the gross earnings of the
</p>
<p>road, the method sanctioned and established by the Government and
</p>
<p>the Courts of the United States.
</p>
<p>I would respectfully ask if it is possible by any bookkeeping devices
</p>
<p>to change the legal rights resting on these inexorable facts?
</p>
<p>If you will refer to the Charter of the Company, you will nd by its
</p>
<p>seventh section that the holders of the common stock of S. D. are
</p>
<p> entitled  to dividends out of the  balance of the net earnings of the
</p>
<p>railroad  after payment of 7 per cent. on the preferred stock.
</p>
<p>Please observe the language of the charter. The common stock-
</p>
<p>holders are  entitled to dividends, etc.
</p>
<p>By the fourth article the preferred stockholders are to  receive  divi-
</p>
<p>dends when the prots from all sources admit of them; and deducting
</p>
<p>those dividends from the net earnings  of the railroad, out of the
</p>
<p>balance the common stockholders are entitled to a dividend
</p>
<p>not exceeding six per cent. in each year.
</p>
<p>Down to the year 1885 you recognized the lawful method of as-
</p>
<p>certaining net earnings contemplated by the Government and the
</p>
<p>Courts. In 188 5 you changed it, after it had been established in your

</p>
<p>Company from the rst day it paid dividends down to the time when
</p>
<p>it became necessary to change it or pay dividends on the common
</p>
<p>stock.
</p>
<p>I would respectfully ask if the latter necessity can be obviated by an
</p>
<p>64
</p>
<p>inequitable and unwarrantable phange in the mode of stating the re-
</p>
<p>sults of your operations; or, in other words, whether it is legalh/ possible
</p>
<p>to change facts by a mere manipulation of gures?
</p>
<p>I think you cannot fail to agree with me that no such change can
</p>
<p>be lawfully accomplished. If it cannot be, then the common stock
</p>
<p>holders were entitled from the net earnings of 1886 to a cash
</p>
<p>dividend of six per cent, and are now lawfully entitled to it. In
</p>
<p>view of the fact that the preferred stockholders have managed to pay
</p>
<p>themselves in the last six years $2,165,924 in dividends, I think you
</p>
<p>will admit it is high time to do something in this way for the com-
</p>
<p>mon stock. Yours very truly, JOHN O. SARGENT.

<p>PRESIDENT FISHER To MR. SARGENT.
</p>
<p>JOHN O. SARGENT, Esq,
</p>
<p>28 East 35th Street, New York.
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,-Your favor of April 30th is received. In reply will
</p>
<p>say a number of the common Stockholders have commenced an action
</p>
<p>against the Company, which involves the questions suggested by your
</p>
<p>letter.
</p>
<p>A pamphlet is now in press containing the complaint and answer
</p>
<p>of the Company and Directors thereto, to which I can add nothing.
</p>
<p>I will mail you this pamphlet as soon as printed, which will be in a
</p>
<p>few days. Yours truly, W. H. FISHER,
</p>
<p>President and General Superintendent.
</p>
<p>No. VIII.
</p>
<p>RETIREMENT OF PREFERRED STocx.
</p>

</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, --Replying to your inquiry of this date, I beg leave to

</p>
<p>Ditto for the month of January, 1887. . .. $126,311 91

</p>
<p>large. Income for February not yet made up.
