<p>This volume is published with the intention of arous-
</p>
<p>ing my fellow-citizens to a realization of the high-
</p>
<p>handed methods pursued in ''Wall Street."
</p>
<p>"Wall Street"  the capitol of our country, because
</p>
<p>j it governs our commerce, industry and finance, and con-
</p>
<p>trols our welfare and destinies.
</p>
<p>^ "Wall Street" must have our eyes focused upon it;
</p>
<p>^ or it will have its hands tightened upon us.
</p>
<p>It is treason to "Wall Street" to make its methods
</p>
<p>public, but treason is justifiable when committed for
</p>
<p>'^ the benefit of mankind.
</p>
<p>I am fully aware of the seriousness of the assertions
</p>
<p>contained in this exposure. I am also aware of the
</p>
<p>power of those against whom the charges are pre-
</p>
<p>ferred.
</p>
<p>That persecution will follow is almost a certainty.
</p>
<p>But it is a duty which must be performed and can
</p>
<p>best be performed by one in my position.
</p>
<p>Twenty years in Wall Street has given me ample

<p>opportunity to gather facts which I hope, from time to
</p>
<p>time, to make public.
</p>
<p>It is neither malice nor vengeance that prompts the

<p>publication of this volume, but it is done as a service

<p>to society.

<p>THE FINANCIAL CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>The Imancial panic of 1907 sounds a warning which
</p>
<p>all must heed and to which none can aiiord to remain
</p>
<p>indifferent '
</p>
<p>It is a warning which unheeded spells disaster and
</p>
<p>ruin to you and me and the nation.
</p>
<p>It is a warning which makes a demand for serious
</p>
<p>attention and calls for thorough investigation.
</p>
<p>This panic teaches a lesson we must all act upon.
</p>
<p>The panic is rich in events. Prom them innumer-
</p>
<p>able, valuable lessons may be learned.
</p>
<p>The object of the writer is to review some of the
</p>
<p>events of that memorable panic for the purpose of
</p>
<p>proving that they were premeditated, and not accidental,
</p>
<p>as some would have us believe, that they foreshadow
</p>
<p>grave danger and if repeated will again cause distrust
</p>
<p>and fear. Industrial and financial institutions will be
</p>
<p>wiped out, labor will be idle and privation and stag-
</p>
<p>nation will prevail.

</p>
<p>The conspiracy enacted proves, that we are not treated
</p>
<p>equally by the government; that we are not protected
</p>
<p>in our property rights and that our financial, commer-
</p>
<p>cial and industrial institutions are in grave peril of
</p>
<p>being absorbed by the "Money Powers"; that the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment has become impotent in the protection of our
</p>
<p>property or that it has become the instrument of these
</p>
<p>"Money Powers".
</p>
<p>The financial panic of 1907 further demonstrates
</p>
<p>that with the "money trust" lies the power to with-
</p>
<p>draw all legal money from circulation, to deny
</p>
<p>credit, to deprive business institutions of their good
</p>
<p>will and force them to sell out, merge or fail.
</p>
<p>To substantiate the assertions made herein, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing facts are submitted in evidence:
</p>
<p>And, if I succeed in arousing the public to a realiza-
</p>
<p>tion of this, the greatest moral crime of the century,
</p>
<p>I will be amply repaid for my labor.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1907 banks and industrial corporations
</p>
<p>were actually forced into bankruptcy or into the hands
</p>
<p>of receivers.
</p>
<p>Typical of these banks were the following in the City
</p>
<p>of New York:
</p>
<p>Knickerbocker Trust.
</p>
<p>Oriental Bank.
</p>
<p>Amsterdam Bank.
</p>
<p>Mechanics' & Traders' Bank.
</p>
<p>Williamsburg Trust.
</p>
<p>Borough Bank of Brooklyn.
</p>
<p>And hundreds of others throughout the nation. So
</p>
<p>much fer banks, for the present.
</p>
<p>Of industrial corporations a very striking example

</p>
<p>was furnished by the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company.
</p>
<p>It is admitted that the Tennessee Coal & Iron Com-
</p>
<p>pany had $200,000,000 in natural resources. It could
</p>
<p>not, however, market its securities and was compelled
</p>
<p>to sell to the United States Steel Company for $29,000,-
</p>
<p>000. That is $171,000,000 less than the estimate of
</p>
<p>its natural resources alone.
</p>
<p>And this purchase, if so it may be termed, was not
</p>
<p>paid for in cash, but by substituting United States
</p>
<p>Steel Company's bonds for the stock of the Tennessee
</p>
<p>Coal & Iron Company.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that both Mr. J. P. Morgan
</p>
<p>and Mr. Geo. W. Perkins were and are directors of
</p>
<p>the United States Steel Company.
</p>
<p>The above facts show hundreds of firms crumbling
</p>
<p>to dust, as it were, not because of corruption or mis-
</p>
<p>management, but because of an extraordinary spon-
</p>
<p>taneous demand for cash.
</p>
<p>Two questions present themselves:
</p>
<p>First: What caused this sudden demand for cash?
</p>
<p>Second: Wliat caused the scarcity of cash?
</p>
<p>The answers are: First, the press notices as will
</p>
<p>be shown in the instance of the Trust Company of
</p>
<p>America, instigated by one of the arch conspirators,
</p>
<p>Geo. W. Perkins; Second, the substitute money being
</p>
<p>circulated as will be evidenced by reproductions of same
</p>
<p>at the close of the book.
</p>
<p>This substitute money was issued to the amount of
</p>
<p>$500,000,000, and enabled some of the "Money Lords"
</p>
<p>to corner the outstanding cash. This was done with
</p>
<p>a total disregard to the consequences suffered by others.
</p>
<p>It is a violation of the law to issue money. It is
</p>
<p>illegal to do many other things. But law may be cir-
</p>
<p>cimivented.
</p>
<p>It is because the "Money Lords" can afford to pay

</p>
<p>the best legal talents, that they can purchase the best
</p>
<p>brains, they are kept informed on how to circumvent
</p>
<p>the law. By so doing the "Money Lord" lifts himself
</p>
<p>out of the criminal class and holds himself out as a
</p>
<p>respectable, aye, even a model citizen.
</p>
<p>By issuing these "Money" certificates or "money"
</p>
<p>substitutes, the "Money Lord" gathers and retains all
</p>
<p>legal money. Thereby a scarcity of currency is created.
</p>
<p>When you are hard pressed, and you feel that you
</p>
<p>are stifled because of lack of cash, you know where to
</p>
<p>go. The "Money Lord" knows that it is against the
</p>
<p>law to charge more than the legal rate of interest, but
</p>
<p>he also knows that he may charge a bonus for "pro-
</p>
<p>curing" the money or a fee for "liis" counsel. And
</p>
<p>he does.
</p>
<p>His activity is like that of the steam roller. As
</p>
<p>the steam roller moves, everything on its path is crushed
</p>
<p>and flattened. It possesses no feeling, it knows no
</p>
<p>mercy and heeds no cries. It is cold and hard and
</p>
<p>crushing. You are at the mercy of the mercyless. You
</p>
<p>realize that it is a foul game. "Yes, my 'Money Lord,'
</p>
<p>you hold the cards, you shuffle them, you hand them
</p>
<p>around, you tell us which to play, you make your own
</p>
<p>rules, you dictate your own terms. And we obey and
</p>
<p>begin to realize that your 'justice is but a sham and
</p>
<p>delusion."
</p>
<p>In October, 1907, the money situation was such, that
</p>
<p>the powers controlling it, probably found that the time
</p>
<p>was ripe for the execution of the plans which they had
</p>
<p>laid to exterminate the UNDESIRABLE competitors
</p>
<p>in the financial and industrial fields.
</p>
<p>Rumblings had been heard for some weeks and on
</p>
<p>October 22d, the storm broke loose.
</p>
<p>The Knickerbocker Trust Company closed its doors.
</p>
<p>During that day it payed out $8,000,000 in cash;
</p>
<p>the last demand being a check for $1,500,000.

</p>
<p>Here we have a concern forced into receivership, by
</p>
<p>unusual efforts, by unusual demands.
</p>
<p>Where did the demand for the million and a half
</p>
<p>come from ? It came from the Hanover National Bank,
</p>
<p>of which Mr. James Stillman was a director. And
</p>
<p>Mr. Stillman is no small character; he is besides director
</p>
<p>of the above named bank, also President of the National
</p>
<p>City Bank, a Rockefeller institution.
</p>
<p>It is of importance to note that the New York
</p>
<p>Times of October 23, 1907, expressly states, "$1,500,-
</p>
<p>000, Hanover National check closes the KnickerbocJcer
</p>
<p>Trust Co."
</p>
<p>So far we see in the Tennessee Coal & Iron Com-
</p>
<p>pany the Morgan interests at work; in the Knicker-
</p>
<p>bocker Trust Company, the Rockefeller interests at
</p>
<p>work. Thus far we see them at work, separately. A?
</p>
<p>we proceed we will also see them at work, jointly.
</p>
<p>On the same day, October 22d, the Trust Company
</p>
<p>of America paid out, in cash, $1,600,000, and yet
</p>
<p>Mr. Oakleigh Thorne, its president, informs us that
</p>
<p>the run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company in no
</p>
<p>way affected his company.
</p>
<p>Again, on that same day, October 22d, after bank-
</p>
<p>ing hours, Mr. George W. Perkins and Mr. Henry P.
</p>
<p>Davison, both of the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co.,
</p>
<p>called on Mr. Oakleigh Thorne at the offices of the
</p>
<p>Trust Company of America. They thoroughly exam-
</p>
<p>ined the financial condition of the institution.
</p>
<p>It showed, to be brief, that it had $74,000,000 in
</p>
<p>assets, of which $12,000,000 was in cash.
</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins and Mr. Davison said to Mr. Thome:
</p>
<p>"They were pleased to find the conditions as good as
</p>
<p>they were."
</p>
<p>That same night, October 22d, a secret meeting was

</p>
<p>held at the Manhattan Hotel. Ostensibly to save the
</p>
<p>Trust Company of America. Present on this event
</p>
<p>were Mr. George W. Perkins, Mi. Henry P. Davison,
</p>
<p>Mr. J. P. Morgan, Mr. George B. Cortelyou, then Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of the U. S. Treasury, and a member of the
</p>
<p>cabinet of President Theodore Roosevelt and others.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Thorne, President of the Trust Company of
</p>
<p>America, was conspicuous by his absence. He, the
</p>
<p>most interested of all was not invited.
</p>
<p>And this self-appointed committee decided  What?
</p>
<p>To save the Trust Company of America. For whom?
</p>
<p>Judge for yourself.
</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins, now informed on the financial standing
</p>
<p>of the Trust Company of America, gets busy.
</p>
<p>He prepares a statement for publication. It is de-
</p>
<p>livered to Mr. Melville E. Stone, Manager of the Asso-
</p>
<p>ciated Press. On the following morning, October 23d,
</p>
<p>it appears in the New York Times and in part, reads
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>"The chief sore point of the panic is the Trust
</p>
<p>Company of America, etc."
</p>
<p>Its result was obvious.
</p>
<p>A run was started on the Trust Company of America.
</p>
<p>Its president, Mr. Thorne, made every effort possible,
</p>
<p>to stop the run, opening several extra pay windows,
</p>
<p>but of no avail. On that day the Trust Company of
</p>
<p>America was compelled to pay out $13,500,000 in
</p>
<p>cash.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mr. Thome made it his object to
</p>
<p>see Mr. M. E. Stone, for the purpose of informing him
</p>
<p>that the statement which appeared in the Times was
</p>
<p>not true as to the condition of the Trust Company of
</p>
<p>America, and also to see Mr. J. P. Morgan from whom
</p>
<p>he intended to borrow money.
</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan put Mr. Thome off for some time. He
</p>
<p>said the committee appointed to make the investigation

</p>
<p>had not reported.
</p>
<p>Mr. Thorne, was, at that time, unaware of the mid-
</p>
<p>night meeting held at the Manhattan Hotel by Mr.
</p>
<p>Morgan, Mr. Perkins and others.
</p>
<p>It might be added that when Mr. Thorne called at
</p>
<p>the office of Mr. Morgan on October 23d, Mr. Perkins,
</p>
<p>Mr. Davison and Mr. Stillman, President of the Rock-
</p>
<p>efeller Bank, were present. Here we have them jointly;.
</p>
<p>Rockefeller's representative in Morgan's office, planning
</p>
<p>to "save".
</p>
<p>It is quite evident that the action of Mr. J. P. Mor-
</p>
<p>gan was a subterfuge, and that he waited for the psyco-
</p>
<p>logical moment to "get" Mr. Thorne or his institution
</p>
<p>to accede to his terms. The terms were $20,000,000
</p>
<p>of securities selected by Mr. Morgan's own committee,
</p>
<p>for a $10,000,000 loan, only $6,000,000 of which was
</p>
<p>immediately advanced  the rest in installments. Later
</p>
<p>a loan of the same nature of $15,000,000 on $30,000,-
</p>
<p>000 of picked securities was made.
</p>
<p>As a result of Mr. Perkin's machinations, the finn
</p>
<p>of J. P. Morgan & Co. and others, got possession of
</p>
<p>$50,000,000 of the most valuable securities held by the
</p>
<p>Trust Company of America by advancing $25,000,000
</p>
<p>in installments. Some saving!
</p>
<p>It is quite plain that the Morgan-Rockefeller clique
</p>
<p>killed two birds with one stone.
</p>
<p>First: The Knickerbocker Trust Company was com-
</p>
<p>pelled to close upon presentation of a check for $1,500,-
</p>
<p>000, drawn by the Hanover National Bank, of which,
</p>
<p>Mr. James Stillman, the father-in-law of Mr. William
</p>
<p>Rockefeller's two sons, is a director.
</p>
<p>Second: As the dirfi|it result of the publication of
</p>
<p>Mr. Perkin's statement in the New York Times, the
</p>
<p>run on the Trust Company of America occurred.
</p>
<p>It was these events that intensified the real panic.
</p>
<p>They put our country in a frenzy, caused untold

</p>
<p>suffering, misery and numerous suicides.
</p>
<p>These and other events helped the money oligarchy
</p>
<p>to obtain control of 36 per cent of the wealth of the
</p>
<p>nation. (N. Y. World, October 21, 1912).
</p>
<p>Mr. Oakleigh Thorne, formerly president of the
</p>
<p>Trust Company of America, through merging of that
</p>
<p>Trust Company with the Equitable Trust Company
</p>
<p>(a Morgan institution), has been cast aside, like a
</p>
<p>squeezed lemon.
</p>
<p>Mr. John D. Barney, formerly president of the
</p>
<p>Knickerbocker Trust Company, committed suicide. He
</p>
<p>left a letter saying: "I do not kill myself because I
</p>
<p>am a poor man, but because I have lost faith in man-
</p>
<p>kind."
</p>
<p>Mr. George B. Cortelyou is now (November, 1912),
</p>
<p>the president of the Consolidated Gas Company of New-
</p>
<p>York. This is a William Rockefeller (the brother of
</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller) concern.
</p>
<p>A few questions might now be in place.
</p>
<p>First: What was the object of Mr. Perkins in in-
</p>
<p>vestigating the Trust Company of America?
</p>
<p>Second: Why, after he had declared himself:
</p>
<p>"Pleased to find the conditions as good", did he publish
</p>
<p>a statement which caused a run on the Trust Company
</p>
<p>of America?
</p>
<p>Third: Wliy a secret midnight meeting and Mr.
</p>
<p>Thorne, an interested party, not invited?
</p>
<p>Fourth: How comes Mr. George B. Cortelyou, Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of the U. S. Treasury and member of the Cabinet
</p>
<p>of President Theodore Roosevelt, to be present ?
</p>
<p>Fifth: Why did the U. S. Treasury, with the knowl-
</p>

<p>Sixth: Wliy was not that $25,000,000 advanced to
</p>
<p>the suffering banks, which had a super-abundance of
</p>
<p>gilt-edge securities, and whose only ailment was the
</p>
<p>lack of cash?
</p>
<p>Seventh: How was it that the banks and industrial
</p>
<p>corporations that stood in the good graces of the "Fi-
</p>
<p>nancial Fraternity" were able to issue and circulate
</p>
<p>the substitute money, some exhibits of which I herewith
</p>
<p>submit in the following pages?
</p>
<p>SUBSTITUTE MONEY ISSUED.
</p>
<p>Congress, alone, has the power to issue money. Constitution of the United States of America, Article 1,.
</p>
<p>Section 10  No state shall coin money, emit bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a
</p>
<p>tender of payment of debts.
</p>
<p>In presenting the following exhibits of "unlawful"'
</p>
<p>money issued by many banks in many cities in all parts
</p>
<p>of the United States, we call the reader's attention to
</p>
<p>the fact that at no time was public attention called to
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>The exhibits shown are reproductions of some of
</p>
<p>the substitute money (?) issued, to the amount of
</p>
<p>$500,000,000 by banks and associations throughout the
</p>
<p>United States and range in denominations from 25
</p>
<p>cents to $50,000. No. 1 is an exhibit of the 25c type
</p>
<p>issued by the M'ontgomery Clearing House, Alabama.
</p>
<p>No. 2 is an exhibit of those issued by the New York
</p>
<p>Clearing House Association to the amount of $101,-
</p>
<p>000,000.
</p>
<p>The date of the first issue was October 36th, 1907.

</p>
<p>The last issue was January 30th, 1908, final cancella-
</p>
<p>tion March 28th, 1908, just one hundred and twenty-
</p>
<p>five banking days to carry out their plans. Then the
</p>
<p>lawful money was restored.
</p>
<p>How was it these institutions could gauge so accurate-
</p>
<p>ly the length of the panic as to practically guarantee
</p>
<p>payment of debts at a set date?
</p>
<p>In the manufacturing centres of the nation, the wage
</p>
<p>workers were paid in "payroll" checks of which No. 3
</p>
<p>and 4 are exhibits. Only those industries which were
</p>
<p>in good standing with the Money Trust enjoyed this
</p>
<p>privilege. Typical of these were the Standard Oil Com-
</p>
<p>pany, Duluth and Iron Eange E. E., etc. Some of
</p>
<p>these "payroll" checks had this notice:
</p>
<p>"To our employees: This check will be received in
</p>
<p>payment of your bill by merchants and business men
</p>
<p>and will be deposited by them in their banks for pay-
</p>
<p>ment through the Clearing House."
</p>
<p>This proved to be a means of draining the merchants
</p>
<p>of all available lawful money, and forced them to ac-

</p>
<p>cept in lieu thereof, instruments of which it was said :
</p>
<p>"Many of these checks had no collateral security back
</p>
<p>of them, and were accepted purely on the responsibility
</p>
<p>of the issuing bank."
</p>
<p>This is the kind of money ( ?) that the gold miners
</p>
<p>of Goldfield, Nevada, had refused to accept in lieu of
</p>
<p>authorized legal tender and had gone on strike against.
</p>
<p>President Theodore Eoosevelt on November 18, 1907,
</p>
<p>issued orders to General Funston, to dispatch a sufficient
</p>
<p>force of Federal troops from Presidio (San Francisco,
</p>
<p>Cal.), to make the miners take more kindly to the scrip
</p>
<p>at the point of the bayonet.
</p>
<p>See Appeal to Reasoji, Kansas, December 14, December 28
</p>
<p>1907, and New York Dally People, December T, 1907.
</p>
<p>No. 5 is an exhibit of some of the money ( ?) issued
</p>
<p>by the following banks at Lincoln, Neb., from Novem-
</p>
<p>ber 1st, 1907, to January 15th, 1908:
</p>
<p>National Bank of Commerce.
</p>
<p>The Central National Bank.
</p>
<p>First National Bank.
</p>
<p>City National Bank.
</p>
<p>Farmers' & Merchants' Bank.
</p>
<p>This is the home town of William Jennings Bryan,
</p>
<p>who, in 1896, had startled the Nation by his cry: "You
</p>
<p>shall not press down upon the brow of Labor this crown
</p>
<p>of tliorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross
</p>
<p>of gold. * * * ^g gg^y jjj^ Q^jj. platform that we
</p>
<p>believe that the right to coin and issue money is a .
</p>
<p>function of government. We believe it. We believe
</p>
<p>that it is a part of soverignty, and can no more with
</p>
<p>safety be delegated to private individuals than we can
</p>
<p>afford to delegate to private individuals the power to
</p>
<p>make penal statutes or levy taxes."  William Jennings
</p>
<p>Bryan, before the Democratic National Convention,
</p>
<p>Chicago, 111., July 9, 1896.
</p>
<p>You will notice that this paper money ( ?) was is-

</p>
<p>sued eleven years after the great financial campaign of
</p>
<p>1896, wherein the issue was the Gold Standard vs. Free
</p>
<p>Silver, one championed by William McKinley, the other
</p>
<p>by William Jennings Bryan, both declaring that the
</p>
<p>"Money of the Constitution" should be the money of
</p>
<p>the Nation. The voters, by electing William McKinley,
</p>
<p>decided that the Gold Standard should prevail.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, at Canton, Ohio, the home
</p>
<p>town of the late President William McKinley, the Clear-
</p>
<p>ing House issued substitute paper money in the amounts
</p>
<p>of $1, $2, $5 and $10 (see exlnbit No. 6).
</p>
<p>Hon. Judge Alton Brooks Parker, the nominee for
</p>
<p>the Presidency by the Democratic Convention held at
</p>
<p>St. Louis, Mo., July 9, 1904, sent a message to the con-
</p>
<p>vention declining to accept the nomination, except on
</p>
<p>the understanding that he would maintain the gold
</p>
<p>standard of money value.
</p>
<p>The telegram read:
</p>
<p>"To the Delegates at the Democratic Convention :
</p>
<p>I regard the Gold Standard as firmly and irrevoc-
</p>
<p>ably established, and I shall act accordingly.
</p>
<p>ALTON B. PAEKER."
</p>
<p>At Portland, Ore., and Seattle, Wash, (see exhibit
</p>
<p>No. 7), the money (?) instead of being based on Gold
</p>
<p>and Silver as is generally required by law, was issued
</p>
<p>by resolution of the Clearing House Association, upon
</p>
<p>Lumber, Wheat and Canned Fish to the amount of 75
</p>
<p>per cent of what they cleaimed it to be worth.
</p>
<p>In Portland, Los Angeles and Spokane (see exhibits
</p>
<p>Nos. 7, 8 and 9), the substitute money bore close re-
</p>
<p>semblance to real money.
</p>
<p>These exhibits of money ( ?) conclusively prove that
</p>
<p>preparations had long been made and care taken to
</p>
<p>circumvent the law of the various states. They suggest

</p>
<p>premeditation and design in engineering this affair.
</p>
<p>The facts herein shown make it self-evident that the
</p>
<p>"Money Trust" has it in its power to eliminate any
</p>
<p>Banker, Merchant, Manufacturer, Farmer or Wage
</p>
<p>Worker they deem advisable. Whether he be the cus-
</p>
<p>todian of seventy-four million, as was Mr. Thorne, or
</p>
<p>part owner of a corporation, like the Tenessee Coal &
</p>
<p>Iron Co., with two hundred millions of property. For
</p>
<p>this Financial Oligarchy are a law unto themselves and
</p>
<p>dictators to all others.
</p>
<p>Therefore, unless earnest thought and careful con-
</p>
<p>sideration is given to this situation, unless a concerted
</p>
<p>move is made to prevent a repetition thereof, this Na-
</p>
<p>tion, to its sorrow, will soon realize that its people are
</p>
<p>gradually being deprived of their incentives, hopes and
</p>
<p>asperations and that the great body of American citizens
</p>
<p>will be reduced to industrial servitude.
