<p>2 THE CONSPIRACY. ACT I.
</p>
<p>On Grecian statue. All heads bare. Hats off.
</p>
<p>Enter Dr. John.
</p>
<p>Dr. J. Good morning, gentlemen ! What enterprise
</p>
<p>Have you afoot to signalize this day
</p>
<p>And beauteous place % It must be some high aim,
</p>
<p>That in such brave array could call you forth.
</p>
<p>Frank. On deeds of high emprise are we intent.
</p>
<p>Know' st thou of some fierce monster to be slain,
</p>
<p>Or beauteous damsel, wandering all forlorn.
</p>
<p>In forest lost, or lonely captive kept,
</p>
<p>In lofty tower, or dark, deep horrid cave,
</p>
<p>By giant grim, or bloody baron bold %
</p>
<p>Oh ! speak ! that to the rescue v>^e may rush.
</p>
<p>Dr. J. Monsters enow, of vice and wrong, there are,
</p>
<p>That cause sad desolation in the earth,
</p>
<p>' Gainst which to fight were truest chivalry ;
</p>
<p>And damsels, too, there are forlorn, who sigh
</p>
<p>For gallant knights to come to their relief :
</p>
<p>But bearded chamjDions they do prefer.
</p>
<p>Wait, my dear sirs ! till ye are out of school,
</p>
<p>And have your beards, ere ye adventure forth
</p>
<p>On such achievements. 'Twill demand of you
</p>
<p>All of the manhood ye will e' er attain.
</p>
<p>But, speak, sirs ! tell me, wherefore are ja here.
</p>
<p>Frank. I will expound
</p>
<p>Music heard.
</p>
<p>Angelo. Hark ! Hush ! There's music here.
</p>
<p>Ernest. ' Tis floating in the air. Whence can it come 'I
</p>
<p>Angelo. How sweet and spirit like it is !
</p>
<p>Dr. John. It breathes
</p>
<p>A strange, unearthly sweetness. It must be,
</p>
<p>That in the air some gentle Ariel
</p>
<p>Is hovering over us.
</p>
<p>Frank. More like, 'tis Puck,

</p>
<p>From off the pine upon tlie mountain top,
</p>
<p>To practice on it airs of fairy land-
</p>
<p>He seeks to lure us off to some lone place,
</p>
<p>Some deep, dark dell, or secret strange recess.
</p>
<p>Amidst the forest, where the fairies haunt.
</p>
<p>And where bewildered in the tangled wilds
</p>
<p>AVe'll be within his power, for him, the imp,
</p>
<p>To play his pranks and knavish tricks on us.
</p>
<p>Marlx.. Hist! Hist! The music dies away! 'Tisgone!
</p>
<p>Dr. John. Now, speak, sir ! Tell me, wherefore are
</p>
<p>ye here ? (course
</p>
<p>Frank. I will explain. You know that by the
</p>
<p>Of custom immemorial, in this
</p>
<p>Most ancient seat of learning and of wit,
</p>
<p>We students, here, to-morrow, publicly.
</p>
<p>Must be in scholarship and eloquence,
</p>
<p>Examined by the learned men of the realm.
</p>
<p>Then he, who first in merit shall be found,
</p>
<p>Will be entitled to a crown, a wreath.
</p>
<p>That on his brow should by the King be placed 
</p>
<p>E'en by the sacred hand of majesty.
</p>
<p>But to tlie wars away the King has gone ; 
</p>
<p>And none is there to do this duty now.
</p>
<p>But she, his child, the lovely Princess, whom,
</p>
<p>As regent he has left to rule the realm.
</p>
<p>As his imperial prototype, the sun.
</p>
<p>When off he goes to other realms afar.
</p>
<p>Both by the moon, sweet regent of the night,
</p>
<p>In gentle reflex of his mightier beam,
</p>
<p>Still unto us dispense his blessed light.
</p>
<p>Hence has our royal comrade, the good Prince,
</p>
<p>The cousin of the Princess, gone to learn
</p>
<p>From her, if she will take her father' s place
</p>
<p>And grace to-morrow' s victor with his crown.

<p>Angelo. It is up yonder.

<p>MarTc. It is in the breeze.
</p>
<p>Franlc. It is some merry spirit of the air,
</p>
<p>That' s doing this for fun, to puzzle us,
</p>
<p>And tease us with his elhsh melody.
</p>
<p>He' s laughing now at our perplexity.
</p>
<p>Dr. John. There is a thread of sadiiess in the straiLfv
</p>
<p>Methinlis the harps of Judah hung upon
</p>
<p>The willows by the streams of Babylon,
</p>
<p>Though uttering no murmur of 2/ioii,
</p>
<p>May yet unto the pitying winds have breathed
</p>
<p>Just such capricious, yet sweet, plaintive tones.
</p>
<p>Marie. ' Tis some melodious zejpliyr in the trees.
</p>
<p>FranJh. Perchance some fancy- stricken youth has*
</p>
<p>Among these leaves a lyre ^olian, [strung
</p>
<p>For the airy fingers to perform upon.
</p>
<p>And thus these airs, that so enchant our ears.
</p>
<p>Are but the touches of the airs of Heaven.
</p>
<p>Enter the rrince.

<p>To-morrow slie will come with all her court,
</p>
<p>Cfreat lords and ladies fair and learned men,

<p>To test our scholarship and eloquence.
</p>
<p>In the evening, at the palace, she will give
</p>
<p>In honor of our class, a festival ;
</p>
<p>A royal one, whereto we all will go
</p>
<p>And taste of earth' s selectest revelry*
</p>
<p>Fraiik. Heaven bless our lovely Princess.
</p>
<p>Mark. As she is good
</p>
<p>And beautiful, may she be ever blest.-
</p>
<p>Angelo. We'll see what Homer in his raptures saw.
</p>
<p>When Yenus, in her beauty, walked before
</p>
<p>Him on Olympus.
</p>
<p>Frank. There'll be a Hebe there,
</p>
<p>Whom I shall see, with nectaron her lips,.
</p>
<p>Sweeter than Jove e'er sipped.
</p>
<p>Dr. Jolin. And doubtless all
</p>
<p>The Graces will be there and troops of nymphs.
</p>
<p>Invite a "poet, and the counterparts
</p>
<p>He'll find to all the gods and goddesses.

<p>Prince. Where is this music ? 'Tis most strange.-

</p>
<p>F'ranJi. I'll bet the pearly gates are now ajar.

<p>6 THE coNsniiACY. Act I.
</p>
<p>And these sweet notes have thence escaped ; or else
</p>
<p>It is some genial spirit stolen forth,
</p>
<p>Some siren of the golden harps come down
</p>
<p>To charm and lure us with these hints of Heaven.
</p>
<p>Prince. Comrades! where' s Paul, our learned 'and
</p>
<p>'Tis strange that he's not here. [gentle friend 'i
</p>
<p>Ernest. We've seen him not.
</p>
<p>Julian. As you do say, 'tis strange he is not here.
</p>
<p>'Tis said that he aspires unto the crown.
</p>
<p>Perhaps his courage fails him and he yields
</p>
<p>The prize to bolder aspirants  else sure
</p>
<p>He would be here.
</p>
<p>Prince. I' U go and seek for him.
</p>
<p>I've news that will be music in his ears.
</p>
<p>FranJi. Hold! there's that strain again. It nearer
</p>
<p>comes.
</p>
<p>Prince. It louder is, as if it nearer came. [this,
</p>
<p>Marie. Huzza ! see there ! see there ! What tree is
</p>
<p>That bears such fruit as that %
</p>
<p>Paul dimovered in the Tree.
</p>
<p>Franh. Ha ! ha ! Strange fruit indeed !
</p>
<p>Some species new. Special spontaneous
</p>
<p>Development ! Most like, on some such tree
</p>
<p>Sprang forth that old primeval ape, that was
</p>
<p>Our great ancestor. Darwin ! Science that !
</p>
<p>Or else  I have it now  a theory
</p>
<p>Historical and theological.
</p>
<p>And exegetical and pomological, 
</p>
<p>I do suspect, that 'tis the kind of fruit.
</p>
<p>With which the serpent tempted mother Eve
</p>
<p>In Paradise.
</p>
<p>Marh. And all the mothers since. [let
</p>
<p>Franik. Were one of Eve' s fair daughters here we' d

<p>Paul comes doiaifrom the Tree.
</p>
<p>Prince. By all the powers and spirits it is Paul.
</p>
<p>Scene I. the coistspiracy. 7
</p>
<p>Julian. By all the fiends and devils it is Paul.
</p>
<p>Prince. Art tliou this spirit that's been mocking ns %
</p>
<p>Frank. Stick pins in him and see if 'tis real flesh,
</p>
<p>Or only some thin spiritual stuff. (dare^
</p>
<p>Julian {aside). I'd stick him with my dagger, if L
</p>
<p>Or knock him in the head, or poison him.
</p>
<p>I hate him, for he doth outrival me.
</p>
<p>His genius, spite of all my art and toil,
</p>
<p>Doth baffle me. Were he out of my way.
</p>
<p>The triumph and the crown, and more than all.
</p>
<p>The smiles of the sweet Princess would be mine.
</p>
<p>Paul. Good friends 'twas but a jest I will explain.
</p>
<p>I had come out alone into this grove.
</p>
<p>And here was sitting on this grassy bank.
</p>
<p>Listening unto the music floating round ;
</p>
<p>And catching on my lute, from breeze and bird,
</p>
<p>Such notes as pleased my fancy. Thus I made
</p>
<p>The little melody that you did hear.
</p>
<p>Just then I saw you coming and I thought
</p>
<p>Pd try my music on you. So I hid
</p>
<p>In these thick branches, and as you came near,
</p>
<p>I threw out on the breeze the notes you heard ;
</p>
<p>And then the breeze did add its cadences,
</p>
<p>Its trills and swells, and waft them to your ears.
</p>
<p>It was its wild and fitful character,
</p>
<p>Caught from the zephyr, that perplexed you so.
</p>
<p>And puzzled you to know whence came
</p>
<p>The mystic and uncertain harmony.
</p>
<p>The jest succeeded better than I thought.
</p>
<p>Prince. 'Twas a most delicately merry jest ;
</p>
<p>'Tis clear the zephyr did conspii'e with you
</p>
<p>And instigate the mischief.
</p>
<p>Franh. Tell us, sir.
</p>
<p>Why is it, that thou wanderest thus alone,

<p>Some sin committed, tliat tlioii liere dost mourn 1
</p>
<p>Pi&,ul. Only tlie general sin, that all slioiild mourn,
</p>
<p>Have I to sorrow for.
</p>
<p>Frank. Has the blind god
</p>
<p>Then smit thee with his sad yet sweet dejection ?
</p>
<p>PomI. Love ne'er at me has aimed his poisoned shaft-
</p>
<p>Frank. Wert thou thus sad and lonely from thy
</p>
<p>Did melancholy mark thee for her own % birth I
</p>
<p>Paul. Not sad. nor melancholy ; when alone
</p>
<p>Then the least lonely am I. Airy shapes
</p>
<p>And beings bright do keep me company.
</p>
<p>Prince. I do believe thee. Thou in thy rich thoughts
</p>

<p>That in wise ways we should pursue good ends.

<p>The spirit of the dove we should possess.

<p>Its pliancy to bend to obstacles

<p>Our aims should e'er be generous,  ^to do good,

</p>
<p>Whose life has been one long conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Hated and hunted of the tyrants, he
</p>
<p>With plots and wiles has met and baffled them ;

<p>His genius, zeal and purpose pure and high,
</p>
<p>Mightier than were an army in the field.
</p>
<p>In prison, exile, pain and poverty.

<p>Yet has he been a power in the world,

<p>He's not of the stern mould that Brutus was.

<p>Frank. True, he' s of gentle nature : Yet in him
</p>
<p>There is the stuff, that heroes are made of.
</p>
<p>I do remember, one dark gusty night,

<p>When through the startled city piercing rang
</p>
<p>The cry of "fire." The citizens, awaked
</p>
<p>And guided by the glare, that lit the night,
</p>
<p>Rushed to the conflagration. But too late..
</p>
<p>A stately mansion stood, enwrapt in flames.
</p>
<p>That with fierce exultation swept the ski^s,
</p>
<p>And shook defiance at the eager crowd
</p>
<p>That gazed at them in sad stern impotence. .
</p>
<p>When, lo ! a woman's shriek did pierce our ears,
</p>
<p>And swiftly, through the pallid multitude,
</p>
<p>The whisper ran that 'twas a mother's cry,
</p>
<p>And that her babe was in the biarning ruin.
</p>
<p>The mocking fires smote back the rushing crowd,.
</p>
<p>That sprang unto the rescue. Baffled shrank
</p>
<p>Brave cxen, who had stood eye to eye with death.
</p>
<p>And hope died in our hearts. When suddenly
</p>
<p>A youth appeared amidst the flames, that seemed
</p>
<p>To seize him as their victim, as he leaped,
</p>
<p>Fearless amidst them. For an interval,
</p>
<p>A breathless, agonizing instant, he
</p>
<p>Was gone, lost to our eager straining sight,

<p>To win the answer back from thee,

<p>Thy love, more dear than life to me,

<p>A noise ! She comes ! A brighter starlight no"W

<p>Will beam from out her eyes upon the night.
</p>
<p>Ha ! Who is this ? Her father ! Jupiter

<p>For Hebe ! He doth see me not. I'll hide

<p>Dr. Jolm. There's no one here. It must have beeif
</p>
<p>a dream.
</p>
<p>' Twas that Greek chorus running in my head.
</p>
<p>I fell asleep repeating it. It still
</p>
<p>Wrought in my brain and did sugg^t the dream.'
</p>
<p>Methought a choir, with flowers all garlanded,
</p>
<p>Of those, who fought at Salamis, did come
</p>
<p>With Sophocles for leader and did sing,
</p>
<p>With harp and' dance, peans of victory.
</p>
<p>Such as I trust 5ur youth will sing ere long,"
</p>
<p>The music flo'';Ved so sweetly, I would fain
</p>
<p>Dream ever so, sleeping and "shaking too.
</p>
<p>I think I can recall it. ISTo. 'Tis gone.
</p>
<p>I almost had it. May not that be it ?
</p>
<p>Singing heard at a distance.
</p>
<p>It is some reveller. 'Tis not the voice,
</p>
<p>And all unlike the strange, sweet melody.
</p>
<p>It must have been all dream. Yet it did seem'
</p>
<p>I heard it still after I waked, although
</p>
<p>Into a sweet, soft strain it then did sink.

<p>Ha, Ha. Dear good old Plato ! My poor song

<p>And visions beautiful, as whispers oft,

<p>Frank. Forgive me for the sleep

<p>I've put to flight. Not mine, but thine the fault,

<p>In that you've made me love and long to come

<p>And linger ever with you, by your side.
</p>
<p>Anna. More welcome is thy coming unto me,
</p>
<p>Than sweetest sleep, or brightest dream could be.
</p>
<p>Frank. As sweet to meet, so bitter 'tis to part.
</p>
<p>Oh ! tell me, when may be the happy time
</p>
<p>When there shall be no parting ; when all mine
</p>
<p>Thou' It be, I thine, each other's evermore.

<p>Then I'll be thine, thine only, wholly thine.

<p>Then too, I' 11 proudly claim thee for mine own.

<p>Anna. They will be such, for they will be of thee.
</p>
<p>32 THE co]^fSPIEACY. Act II.
</p>
<p> Scene III. Same night. Before Paul's House. Enter Paul and Frank.
</p>
<p>Paul. Look at tliat star, yon lone one tliere, and
</p>
<p>How infinite the reacli of its pale beam, [think,
</p>
<p>Traveling to us from its bright sphere so far.
</p>
<p>So is it with our life and influence.
</p>
<p>The truth we do, or utter, goeth forth,
</p>
<p>A beani of light and losetli not its way,
</p>
<p>Amidst remotest centuries.
</p>
<p>FranJc. Aye ! even so.
</p>
<p>Paul. The tree bears not its sweet fruit for itself ;
</p>
<p>But 'tis that we may pluck and eat of it.
</p>
<p>And so with golden fruitage of good deeds
</p>
<p>And gentle influence should our lives abound,
</p>
<p>To make the world more hapjDy.
</p>
<p>Frbjiik. ' Tis most true.
</p>
<p>Paul. They the true artists are, who, as their day^
</p>
<p>Are given them, do mould them into lives
</p>
<p>Of beauty ; and he greatest artist is,
</p>
<p>Who makes his life the one most beautiful.
</p>
<p>To live life rightly is the true high art.
</p>
<p>The highest art, and to aspire in it
</p>
<p>Is better, than to copy Raphaels.
</p>
<p>Greater into a hero or a God
</p>
<p>To mould one' s self, than carve one out of marble.
</p>
<p>E' en Atlios, hewn into his image, yet
</p>
<p>Were poor to that which Alexander was.
</p>
<p>They only truly live, who, with high aims
</p>
<p>And noble deeds do make their lives
</p>
<p>Thus real, earnest, true and beautiful. [ours be.
</p>
<p>Frank. Aye, such should all life be. Such should
</p>
<p>Such may ours be, if we will make them such.
</p>
<p>There is a noble work, the grandest, sir !
</p>
<p>In which man can engage, than which earth has
</p>
<p>No better, loftier one , before us now.

<p>Trusting to you. Hast thou not marked, and mourned
</p>
<p>The ruin that doth desolate the land %
</p>
<p>Has not this general cry of misery
</p>
<p>Pierced in thine ears and harrowed up thy soul %
</p>
<p>Dost thou not see that this once happy land,
</p>
<p>By Heaven made so lovely, by man cursed.
</p>
<p>Is prey to outrage, crime and misery ?
</p>
<p>Paul. Alas ! it is too true.
</p>
<p>Frank. Why is it so ?
</p>
<p>Must it thus ever be ?
</p>
<p>Paul. 'Tis clear, that such
</p>
<p>Is not Heaven' s will toward us, for it has given
</p>
<p>Unto our country every element
</p>
<p>Of greatness and of happiness.
</p>
<p>FranJc. It is, that tyranny doth crush the land.
</p>
<p>The King is but a vile and hoary tyrant.
</p>
<p>Is it not so ?
</p>
<p>Paul. Alas ! it is too true.
</p>
<p>Ah ! why does Heaven so lavish power on them.
</p>
<p>The coarse, the vulgar souled, who cannot see

<p>Its true and noble uses ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Strange is it ?
</p>
<p>Ha, ha  a muddle is it ? muddle all !
</p>
<p>Yet, sir ! there' s order in the way the stars

<p>Are set in Heaven, though they seem strown there
</p>
<p>So wildly. Aye ! and music they doth make,
</p>
<p>Could we but hear it, as they there do roll
</p>
<p>In their eternal course. Heaven ? l^o, not Heaven ;
</p>
<p>It is ourselves not Heaven, we have to blame.

<p>Heaven ever does its part, when men do theks.

</p>
<p>Shall we yield tamely, ever to these wrongs,
</p>
<p>And with base acquiescence sanction them ?
</p>
<p>Heaven forbid ! Submission unto wrong
</p>
<p>Is treason to the right. True loyalty
</p>
<p>A rebel must need be 'gainst tyranny.

</p>
<p>Paul. What is it makes me keep this dagger so ?
</p>
<p>I cannot put it down. It sticks to me.
</p>
<p>And the old Roman' s words ring in my ears,
</p>
<p>And startle fearful echoes in my soul,
</p>
<p>That urge me on to do this fearful deed,
</p>
<p>Aye, more, my country calls and pleads to me.
</p>
<p>IJow blessed it would be, were he to die !
</p>
<p>Then gentle Peace would reign, where now this fiend
</p>
<p>Of blood doth ravage. Ho ! thou kingly Death !
</p>
<p>Thou, who art cursed so oft by gentlest souls.
</p>
<p>For laying low the lovely and the good.

<p>Thou now could' st win for thee unnumbered thanks

<p>From all the hearts of this wide realm, if thou

<p>Would' st on this tyrant do thy blessed work.

<p>Would that the spirit of old Eome walked still.

<p>The noblest citizen of all should rise

</p>
<p>It were to take one vile, pernicious life,

<p>And by it save a thousand nobler ones,

</p>
<p>Whose dreams have ever been of light, and love

<p>Away from me, thou hideous thought ! Away,

<p>Exit Paul and enter Julian.
</p>
<p>Julian. What may that mean? He grasped his

<p>dagger, thus,
</p>
<p>Sternly as if he'd strike with it. I've seen
</p>
<p>Him oft of late buried in reverie ;
</p>
<p>Then he would start  and gaze into the air.
</p>
<p>Then clench his hand and mutter to himself.
</p>
<p>And drop and shake his head, all lost in thought,
</p>
<p>As if he meditated some dread deed,
</p>
<p>Some fearful purpose. I will dog his steps,
</p>
<p>And play the spy on him. When saints do arm,
</p>
<p>Then rogues and devils well may take alarm.

<p>Ernest. 'Tis a new rising of the citizens.
</p>
<p>They've waited for the night to arm themselves ;
</p>
<p>And now they march with shouts and songs, in bands,
</p>
<p>To join the insurrection.
</p>
<p>Citizen. Look there, to the east !
</p>
<p>How red the day-break lightens up the sky.
</p>
<p>Ernest. Nay. Midnight has not struck. It is the
</p>
<p>Of conflagration. The city is a fire. [glare
</p>
<p>See how those flames curl round yon eastern tower.
</p>
<p>They seem to lick the skies with their forked tongues.
</p>
<p>As if hell from beneath were bursting forth.
</p>
<p>The night doth linger long. Would it were day.
</p>
<p>These fearful scenes will fright the morn away.

<p>When marching on to fight for liberty.

<p>His sword above him, shouting "victory."
</p>
<p>His last words, as we raised him, were " I'm free."
</p>
<p>He ,miled, and 'twas the same bright smile we've seen

<p>Blood may be wiped from thee, but will its stain
</p>
<p>E'er leave the soul ? I'll think no more of it,

<p>But to the work at once. Yet first, I'll kneel
</p>
<p>A moment, the last time, perchance, on earth,
</p>
<p>And ope my heart and all its thoughts to heaven.
</p>
<p>He kneels, then soon starts iip, dropping the manuscript.
</p>
<p>Is it a troop of spirits that I see %
</p>
<p>And that stern shade, there, smiling in their midst ;
</p>
<p>Or an illusion is't ? Bright beings seem

<p>Will ye receive his spirit in its flight %

<p>I would not harm his soul, but for his crown
</p>
<p>Of earth would give him a celestial one.
</p>
<p>They're gone. Was it illusion ? Am I mad ?
</p>
<p>Yet will I take it as a sign from Heaven,
</p>
<p>He goes to the Bed.
</p>
<p>How still he sleeps ! How pale, and like to death !
</p>
<p>Here is his heart. 'Tis here I'll strike. Ha, no,
</p>
<p>He breathes not. Still he lies. 'Tis death. He's dead
</p>
<p>Already. God has slain him ; done himself
</p>
<p>His own dread work. Aye, in His justice He
</p>
<p>Has smitten him. Yet no, his breath returns 
</p>
<p>Faintly, as if 'twould die away again ;
</p>
<p>As life in its last struggle strove with Death ;
</p>
<p>And feebly, as if giving up the strife.
</p>
<p>I thought that Heaven had saved me from this deed.

<p>It still is to be done. He' s almost gone.

</p>
<p>Oh ! why. is not Frank here ? He promised me

</p>
<p>What if he' s fallen in this fearful night !
</p>
<p>My father murdered ! My love slain ! Ah me !
</p>
<p>I would go forth  but where ? And should he come.

</p>
<p>Oh ! it is sweet to be beloved.

<p>And oh ! to love, 'tis sweet.
</p>
<p>There comes a crowd. They're armed and pour along,

<p>Dr. Jolm. Nothing biit what these noises do portend.-

<p>List to the distant sounds. There is a change ;

<p>The cannonading slackens, and doth seem

<p>To roll off in the distance, as the foe

<p>Did yield before our army. Sounds it not

<p>Fainter and farther to your ear ? Hark ! Hear !
