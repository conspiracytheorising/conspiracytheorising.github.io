<p>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS TO THE PUBLIC.
</p>
<p>TIHE author of this unpretending volume being a Southern
</p>
<p>man by birth and education, by marriage and location, by
</p>
<p>every sacred tie and interest, political, religious, social, and
</p>
<p>domestic, which makes life desirable, but, by force of circumstances, driven from his home and all the endearing and
</p>
<p>hallowed associations of life, and thrown into communities
</p>
<p>in which all faces are strange and all eyes look with indifference on the heart-crushed refugee as he passes by in
</p>
<p>sad, silent, and lonely meditation, and presuming under
</p>
<p>circumstances so inauspicious to appear before his countrymen in the unenviable character of an author, it may be due
</p>
<p>to himself, as well as to a virtuous, intelligent, and patriotic
</p>
<p>public, to briefly give a few incidents connected with his
</p>
<p>past life.
</p>
<p>He was born in Pendleton district, South Carolina, on
</p>
<p>the 16th day of October, 1814. His parents were pious and
</p>
<p>respectable, and both his father and mother, James and
</p>
<p>Nancy Hunnicutt, were natives of South Carolina.
</p>
<p>In the month of February, 1834, he came as a student to
</p>
<p>Randolph Macon College, Virginia, at which institution he
</p>
<p>remained until the spring of 1836.
</p>
<p>In the month of June, 1836, he married Miss Martha
</p>
<p>Frances Smith, the only surviving daughter of Dr. Charles
</p>
<p>Smith, deceased, of Lunenburg county, Virginia.

</p>
<p>In the month of April, 1847, he moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia, and located in that city, in which he reiii
</p>
<p>iv
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY REMARIS.
</p>
<p>mained a resident up to the 29th of August, 1862, at which
</p>
<p>time the city was being evacuated by General Burnside.
</p>
<p>On the 3d of April, 1850, his wife departed this life; and
</p>
<p>a better woman and a more devoted Christian never lived nor
</p>
<p>died. Her precious remains lie at rest in the Fredericksburg (Va.) Cemetery. She was the mother of six children:
</p>
<p>three are in heaven, and three were living last June.
</p>
<p>In the month of August, 1854, he married Miss Elvira
</p>
<p>M. Samuel, of Fredericksburg, Va., his second and present
</p>
<p>wife. She has no child.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of December, 1848, he commenced the publication of the " Fredericksburg (Va.) Christian Banner,"
</p>
<p>and was the editor and proprietor of that journal until the
</p>
<p>9th of May, 1861, at which time, by force of circumstances
</p>
<p>which he could not control, as the subsequent pages of this
</p>
<p>work will explain, he suspended its publication, and remained a quiet, but anxious, observer of passing events
</p>
<p>until the 18th of April, 1862, at which time Fredericksburg was delivered over to the military authorities of the
</p>
<p>United States Government by the civil authorities of that
</p>
<p>town.
</p>
<p>On the 9th of May, 1862, he resumed the publication of
</p>
<p>the "Christian Banner;" but, owing to the scarcity of
</p>
<p>paper, and wanting other facilities, occasioned by the rebellion against the Government of the United States, the
</p>
<p>"Christian Banner," of necessity, was reduced to half its
</p>
<p>original size. When he closed his office in May, 1861,
</p>
<p>there was a small quantity of paper left on hand, which
</p>
<p>served for the first issue in May, 1862. There being at
</p>
<p>this time no facilities of transportation of goods by which
</p>
<p>citizens could obtain them from the North, and being
</p>
<p>unable to obtain white paper in Fredericksburg, he was
</p>
<p>advised to continue its publication on brown paper,-which
</p>
<p>he did.

<p>Prior to the commencement of the publication of the

<p>V
</p>
<p>"Christian Banner" in 1848,'he published several small
</p>
<p>works, principally, however, of a religious and controversial
</p>
<p>character, which, for the most part, were circulated in Virginia and the Southern States.
</p>
<p>His prominent position before the public for the last
</p>
<p>thirteen years of his life as the editor and proprietor of a
</p>
<p>widely-circulating newspaper, and being a minister of the
</p>
<p>gospel for more than thirty years, should, in his humnble
</p>
<p>opinion, entitle him to some share of public confidence,
</p>
<p>although a stranger and a refugee in the midst of strangers.
</p>
<p>In politics, he has always been a Constitutional Democrat,
</p>
<p>according to the true political and etymological meaning of
</p>
<p>that term. He is now an uncompr'omtising Southern Union
</p>
<p>man, which it is presumed no one will question after reading the subsequent pages of this volume. He is no officeseeker,-has never asked for, nor held, any office, either
</p>
<p>under the Government of the- United States, in any individual State, county, corporation, or neighborhood. His'highest aspirations are to serve his God and country and
</p>
<p>advance the cause of true Christianity and promote the
</p>
<p>happiness of his fellow-man. Prompted by a sense of duty,
</p>
<p>which he feels that he owes to his God and country, his
</p>
<p>wife and children, to his churches and to himself, has
</p>
<p>induced the publication of this volume.
</p>
<p>On Friday, the 29th of August, 1862, about five o'clock
</p>
<p>P.M., a friend of the author came in full haste on horseback
</p>
<p>to his house, to advise him to leave Fredericksburg without
</p>
<p>a moment's delay, as the Confederate troops were supposed
</p>
<p>to be rapidly advancing in great numbers and were nearly
</p>
<p>in sight of the town. On receiving this intelligence, he
</p>
<p>hastened to take leave of his wife, who, on taking the parting hand, said, " Farewell, my dear husband; take care of
</p>
<p>yourself, and I will pray constantly for you, and I will
</p>
<p>pray to the good Lord to watch over you and to take care

</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
</p>
<p>And with a spirit crushed to earth, and a heart overwhelmed with grief, the author was driven out from his
</p>
<p>house, his home, his wife, and from all that makes life desirable on earth, to wander in solitude and sorrow among
</p>
<p>strangers. And, to add to the poignancy of indescribable
</p>
<p>grief which already preyed upon his deeply-throbbing heart,
</p>
<p>he was insulted and treated with contempt by secessionists
</p>
<p>as he left his house and walked through the streets to the
</p>
<p>car-bridge across the Rappahannock River, over which he
</p>
<p>had to pass. And thus, after having been watched, suspicioned, persecuted, proscribed, ostracized, and having his
</p>
<p>very house eavesdropped by contemptible scoundrels and
</p>
<p>damnable traitors for more than twelve long months, was
</p>
<p>at last driven from his home, his wife, his all on earth,
</p>
<p>amidst the taunts, indignities, and insults of the worthless,
</p>
<p>the vile, the God-forsaken, and the hell-deserving.
</p>
<p>On arriving at the head-quarters of General Burnside,
</p>
<p>which were on the north side of the Rappahannock River,
</p>
<p>as the author stood on the hill and looked over upon the
</p>
<p>devoted city, as the sun threw back his golden hues on the
</p>
<p>towering steeples, the tops of the beautiful houses, the lofty
</p>
<p>hill-tops in the far distance, and the lovely valley of the
</p>
<p>Rappahannock, and contrasted these with the awful grandeur of a mighty army with guns planted and all drawn
</p>
<p>-ip in battle-array, skirting the hills and bank of the beautiful Rappahannock River, as it laved the base of the hills
</p>
<p>on which the army was stationed,-as he stood and viewed
</p>
<p>the beautiful, sublime, but terrible melancholy scene before
</p>
<p>him, thoughts of the past, the present, and the horrible
</p>
<p>prospects of the future crowded his mind in such quick
</p>
<p>succession, that, for the first time in his life, he felt in good
</p>
<p>earnest as if he wanted to taste the sweets of death. His philosophy wellnigh forsook him. And for what was all this?
</p>
<p>Had he committed murder or larceny? Was he flying

</p>
<p>from justice? No: nothing of the kind. What then?
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTOtRY REMARKS.
</p>
<p>Vii
</p>
<p>Because of his undying devotion to his country, his detestation of secession, traitors, and treason. This reflection nerved
</p>
<p>him to the resolve to meet the very worst issue that might
</p>
<p>be forced upon hilm.
</p>
<p>On Saturday night, the 30th of August, 1862, he arrived
</p>
<p>in Washington City, where he remained, secluded from
</p>
<p>nearly all society except his dear friends and fellow-sufferers in tribulation, his fellow-refugees from Fredericksburg and its vicinity, of whom there were a goodly number,
</p>
<p>nntil the 5th of November, 1862, at which tile he left
</p>
<p>Washington City, and on the night of the same day he
</p>
<p>arrived with his little son, in the city of Philadelphia, Pa.,
</p>
<p>where he has remained in peaceful retirement up to the
</p>
<p>hour of writing this brief introductory sketch. To say less
</p>
<p>than this, is hardlcy possible; to sacy more than this, may be
</p>
<p>unnecessary.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the author would respectfully offer a few
</p>
<p>brief remarks in relation to the present volume which is
</p>
<p>now offered to the American people. In preparing this
</p>
<p>work for the press, the author has labored under the most
</p>
<p>unfavorable circumstances, as the intelligent reader may
</p>
<p>readily allow when he is informed that every word in this
</p>
<p>book has been written and copied by the author's own hand
</p>
<p>since he has been a refugee. Having no documents to aid
</p>
<p>him except the files of the "Christian Banner," he was
</p>
<p>forced to copy every extract which is introduced into this
</p>
<p>work. The deeply afflicting circumstances, also, under
</p>
<p>which the author has labored while preparing this volume
</p>
<p>for the press, will, no doubt, be taken into consideration by
</p>
<p>the intelligent reader.
</p>
<p>This book, as the reader will observe, is divided into two
</p>
<p>parts. The first part contains sundry editorials which were
</p>
<p>published in the "Christian Banner," beginning as far
</p>
<p>back as the month of March, 1860, and continued until the
</p>
<p>9th of May, 1861. From these editorials, and the matter

</p>
<p>I~~INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
</p>
<p>contained in the first part of this book, the reader will
</p>
<p>learn some of the agencies, influences, intrigues, &c. &c.
</p>
<p>which were used by the arch-traitors of this rebellion to
</p>
<p>consummate their plot of damnable treason against the
</p>
<p>Government of the United States. These editorials having
</p>
<p>been published during the time of the great national excitement, and in the very heart of the rebellion, entitle
</p>
<p>them to more than ordinary consideration, as they were
</p>
<p>written and published while the scenes were being acted
</p>
<p>out, and, therefore, are certainly more accurate and correct
</p>
<p>than if written simply from memory. From March, 1860,
</p>
<p>to May, 1861, the certainty of a dissolution of' the Union,
</p>
<p>in the event of certain contingencies, and the horrors of
</p>
<p>secession, revolution, and civil war, were kept prominently
</p>
<p>before the readers of the "Christian Banner," to deter
</p>
<p>them from committing the suicidal act which the author
</p>
<p>knew, if committed, would inevitably plunge the whole
</p>
<p>country into ruin. Writing so repeatedly on the same subjects-the Union, secession, the intrigues of politicians, the
</p>
<p>certainty of a dissolution, and the horrors of civil war, &c.
</p>
<p>&c.-of necessity causes a sameness' of language and ideas
</p>
<p>in some articles, which it is hoped by the'author will be
</p>
<p>excused by the patriotic and intelligent reader. During
</p>
<p>the time these editorials were being published in the'Banner," some said they would " lock them up, and keep
</p>
<p>them," for the purpose in after-years "to prove the editor
</p>
<p>a false prophet." Let them now do it.
</p>
<p>The circumstances connected with this deep, dark, and
</p>
<p>damnable conspiracy against the United States Government
</p>
<p>are gradually unfolded to the mind of the reader, until he
</p>
<p>reaches the culminating-point, the sacrifice of Virginia,
</p>
<p>when the testimony becomes overwhelming, and every
</p>
<p>doubt is irresistibly swept from the mind, however skeptical
</p>
<p>that mind may be.

</p>
<p>The second part of this work embraces all the leading
</p>
<p>INTRPODUCTORY REIAPR XSo.
</p>
<p>iX
</p>
<p>editorials of the "Christian Banner" during its publication
</p>
<p>from the time of the occupancy of Fredericksburg by the
</p>
<p>United States troops to the time of the evacuation of the
</p>
<p>town by General Burnside in August, 1862. From these
</p>
<p>editorials the reader will learn something of the condition
</p>
<p>of affairs in and about Fredericksburg during the time that
</p>
<p>that ill-fated city was held by the Federals.
</p>
<p>There is one fact connected with this subject which is of
</p>
<p>great and vital importance to the author, and one which
</p>
<p>the intelligent reader cannot fail at once to appreciate. It is
</p>
<p>the following. The editorials of the "Christian Banner"
</p>
<p>before the war, and the editorials of the " Christian Banner"
</p>
<p>since the war, which are published in this book, were published in the same town, in the same office, by the same
</p>
<p>hands, and circulated in the same community: if, therefore, the author had written falsely, every man, woman,
</p>
<p>and child in that community could and would have risen
</p>
<p>up and denounced his editorials as falsehoods and a base
</p>
<p>imposition on the public. This fact alone is sufficient to
</p>
<p>carry conviction to the mind of the intelligent reader as to
</p>
<p>the truth and correctness of the statements of the author.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the author hopes to be able to secure for this
</p>
<p>work a large circulation among the people of the South,
</p>
<p>believing as he does that the facts and truths contained in
</p>
<p>it would be heartily endorsed by thousands of the Southern
</p>
<p>people, if they could only throw off the iron yoke which
</p>
<p>the arch-traitors of this diabolical conspiracy have forced
</p>
<p>upon their necks. We join issue with the leaders in this
</p>
<p>rebellion, and not with the people. The leaders forced the
</p>
<p>war upon the people, and then have the unblushing impudence to say, "It's the people's war;" "the people got it
</p>
<p>up, and the people must fight it out." It is an infamous
</p>
<p>libel upon the people. The people never wanted war; the
</p>
<p>people never got it up: the accursed leaders got it up, and

</p>
<p>loaded pistol pointed at the head of his servant, says,
</p>
<p>"Thrust your hand into the fire, or I'll blow your brains
</p>
<p>out;" when in goes the hand; and when it is burned to a
</p>
<p>crisp, the demon tyrant says, "You did it; it was your
</p>
<p>own act; you have no one to blarae but yourself." But we
</p>
<p>must close these remarks.
</p>
<p>That this unpretending volume may serve some humble
</p>
<p>part in helping to put down this ungodly rebellion, and in
</p>
<p>restoring peace, order, prosperity, and happiness to the
</p>
<p>country; that the leaders in this rebellion may receive
</p>
<p>punishment commensurate with their crimes; that the
</p>
<p>people who have been deceived by them and led into ruin
</p>
<p>may see their error, renounce their leaders, and return to
</p>
<p>their former loyalty to the Union; that refugees everywhere
</p>
<p>may be blessed of God and cared for by their fellow-citizens;
</p>
<p>that their wives and children may be provided for and protected by Heaven from all harm; that the time may speedily
</p>
<p>come when the "Star-Spangled Banner" shall be thrown to
</p>
<p>the breeze from the top of every Capitol and State-House
</p>
<p>in the Union; that tyrants and despots may be crushed;
</p>
<p>that liberty and freedom may triumph over slavery and
</p>
<p>despotism; that secession, with all its horrible train. of
</p>
<p>curses, may be eternally damned; that the Union may
</p>
<p>continue "one and inseparable, now.and forever;" that
</p>
<p>God in mercy may overrule all things for the ultimate
</p>
<p>good of the whole people; that the reader may be blessed,

<p>the country redeemed, and the world saved,-is the sincere

<p>THE AUTHOR'S DEVOTION TO THE UNION-TERRIBLE RESULTS OF A DISSOLUTION FORESHADOWED-EDITORIAL
</p>
<p>OF MARCH 8, 1860.
</p>
<p>DISSOLVE THE UNION.
</p>
<p>OF all the terribly wild and wicked infatuations that
</p>
<p>has ever befallen any nation since the creation of man,
</p>
<p>surely the most awfully reckless and ruinous has seized
</p>
<p>the American people.
</p>
<p>To dissolve the Union in thought is wicked, in
</p>
<p>word it is treason, in act would be to damn a nation
</p>
<p>wholly. Dissolve the Union! And then, what? Then
</p>
<p>may holy angels weep, and all the sainted patriots who.
</p>
<p>fell in freedom's cause on American soil veil their faces
</p>
<p>at the departed glory of the happiest and most highlyfavored people to be found on the pages of the world's
</p>
<p>great history! Then may devils damned laugh at the
</p>
<p>finished folly of man, and chant in fiendish anthems
</p>
<p>the utter annihilation of the purest form of government the world has ever known! Dissolve the Union,
</p>
<p>and civil war begins; fire and sword, carnage, blood,
</p>
<p>death, pestilence, and woe, like a fearful, desolating
</p>
<p>avalanche from heaven, wouldc sweep over "tthe land of

<p>the free, and the home of the brave," involving all in
</p>
<p>the common ruin.
</p>
<p>Dissolve the Union, and the Constitution is gone!
</p>
<p>lost! lost! forever lost!
</p>
<p>The "Star-Spangled Banner" would wave no longer,
</p>
<p>inspiring American hearts with confidence of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, and the rights
</p>
<p>of conscience! No: the liberty of speech, the liberty
</p>
<p>of the press, and the rights of conscience would all
</p>
<p>be crushed to earth,-trampled into dust beneath the
</p>
<p>unhallowed feet of wicked tyrants and bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>despots!
</p>
<p>Dissolve the Union, and the South is dissolved, and
</p>
<p>the North is dissolved, and the whole, Confederacy is
</p>
<p>dissolved! It is vanity-the consummation of follyto talk about North and South, if the Union be dissolved! All confidence, not only between North and
</p>
<p>South, but between man and man, would be destroyed.
</p>
<p>Brother would meet brother, sword and bayonet in
</p>
<p>hand,-brother against brother, father against son,
</p>
<p>and son against father. A man's enemies would be
</p>
<p>everywhere, and his friends nowhere. Enemies abroad
</p>
<p>and enemies at home, without a Constitution, without
</p>
<p>a Congress, without a country, and-may we not say?without a God. For how could such a people look
</p>
<p>unto and call upon a God of justice, love, and mercy,
</p>
<p>having spurned all his blessings and dashed their
</p>
<p>blood-bought privileges into the dust?
</p>
<p>The Constitution of these United States should be
</p>
<p>as sacred to the American people as was the Ar/k of
</p>
<p>the Covenant to God's ancient Israel. Let no polluted
</p>
<p>hand touch the Constitution. It is the legacy-the

<p>great national legacy-left us by our ancestors. It is

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>the price of blood,-the blood of brave men,-the blood
</p>
<p>of patriots, who loved liberty, fought for liberty, bled
</p>
<p>for liberty, died for liberty. Let every true-hearted
</p>
<p>patriot, every American citizen, lay his hands on the
</p>
<p>altar of his God and the Constitution of his country,
</p>
<p>and swear by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,by the God of all the holy apostles,-by the God of
</p>
<p>Washington and the signers of the "Declaration of
</p>
<p>Independence," and by the God of our patriotic ancestors,-to live or die, stand or fall, by the Constitution
</p>
<p>of these United States.
</p>
<p>It is supreme nonsense to talk of a "peaceable
</p>
<p>dissolution" of the Union. It is just as reasonable
</p>
<p>to talk of concord between God and Satan, or of
</p>
<p>harmonizing the laws of heaven and hell. The fact
</p>
<p>is, dissolve the Union, and all is lost,-irrevocably
</p>
<p>lost! Who is prepared to meet the issue? Let him

<p>speak.

</p>
<p>FOR a number of years we had been fearfully impressed with the idea of an eruption in the Federal
</p>
<p>Government, produced by the officious intermeddling
</p>
<p>of the ultra Abolitionists of the North, and the reckless, hot-headed "fire-eaters" of the South. We were

<p>convinced that, if ever these two extremes should
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>meet, revolution and civil war would be the result.
</p>
<p>Hence, we anxiously watched the course of political
</p>
<p>events more critically than many of our friends had
</p>
<p>supposed. Having witnessed, when. a boy, the unhappy state of excitement in South Carolina on the
</p>
<p>question of " Nullification and Union," we dreaded to
</p>
<p>pass through another scene so exciting, unpleasant,
</p>
<p>and destructive to the social and religious privileges
</p>
<p>and enjoyments of the people.
</p>
<p>Prior to the assembling of the "National Democratic Convention" in Charleston, South Carolina, on
</p>
<p>the 23d of April, 1860, we were constantly troubled
</p>
<p>with a strange presentiment that some'terrible catastrophe was about to befall our happy country. It
</p>
<p>will be remembered that great confusion and excitement commenced with the organization of that Convention, occasioned by Mr. Fisher's insisting upon
</p>
<p>his right to present a letter from the Wood delegation, with a resolution attached. The Chairman,
</p>
<p>Francis B. Flournoy, deciding that the subject was
</p>
<p>out of order, a spirited debate took place upon the
</p>
<p>resolution providing for the appointment of a committee upon permanent organization. Without entering
</p>
<p>into the details of that ever-memorable Convention,
</p>
<p>suffice it to say that the delegates from South Carolina,
</p>
<p>Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, &c.
</p>
<p>&c., withdrew from the Convention; whereupon the
</p>
<p>wildest enthusiastic excitement prevailed among the
</p>
<p>friends of the seceding party, and salutes were given
</p>
<p>in honor of the seceders. Why was all this? And
</p>
<p>what was it but the strongest demonstration the
</p>
<p>people could give of their delight at the prospective

<p>downfall of the Republic? In scanning the proceed
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>ings of that Convention, and the final result, together
</p>
<p>with the manifest jubilant spirit of the seceding party,
</p>
<p>and that of their adherents all over the South, our
</p>
<p>heart sickened, and our spirit was stirred within us,
</p>
<p>and in the number of the " Christian Banner" of May
</p>
<p>the 3d, 1860, we wrote the following editorial:"CHARLESTON DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
</p>
<p>"We had thought at one time to say nothing about
</p>
<p>the Charleston Democratic Convention. But what
</p>
<p>friend to his God and country can forbear? Who can
</p>
<p>look into the awful future and with almost a prophetic
</p>
<p>eye behold the destiny of this great republic, and hold
</p>
<p>his peace? What true, patriotic American citizen can
</p>
<p>be an indifferent looker-on? None.
</p>
<p>"Our country has reached a fearful crisis. The
</p>
<p>whole political sea is in a state of universal commotion,
</p>
<p>while awful storms are looming up from every point
</p>
<p>of the compass, all rapidly converging to a single result, the overthrow of the republic. Political corruption
</p>
<p>will prove the downfall of our once happy country.
</p>
<p>Deny it who may, political corruption is doing its
</p>
<p>hellish work.
</p>
<p>"Does the secession of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, Arkansas, Delaware, and
</p>
<p>Texas from the Charleston Convention, prognosticate
</p>
<p>nothing? Who will say so? They quarrel about
</p>
<p>platforms, and fight ghosts and phantoms, when, in
</p>
<p>fact, it is men, money, and fame that absorbs their
</p>
<p>mind, consumes their time, and is working the ruin of
</p>
<p>the Union. The whole body politic is corrupt to the
</p>
<p>very core. From the crowns of their heads even unto

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>their feet they are naught but one great mass of political corruption. The loaves and fishes, the spoils of
</p>
<p>government, to occupy high places, to fill important
</p>
<p>offices, and fatten and revel off of the sweat and toil
</p>
<p>of the people, is the ultimatum of the ambition of most
</p>
<p>modern politicians. We scorn to advocate any such
</p>
<p>course of reckless, wicked, traitorous conduct in any
</p>
<p>man, or set of men.
</p>
<p>"What patriotic soul would hold connection with a
</p>
<p>party of men who are sapping the foundation of our
</p>
<p>Government? Let party men and party measures
</p>
<p>sink into the deepest and darkest shades of political
</p>
<p>damnation! Our country has been duped, gulled,
</p>
<p>swindled, oppressed, and crushed too long already by
</p>
<p>sycophantic knaves, turn-coat politicians, and contemptible demagogues, who stoop lower than the devil
</p>
<p>would to get into office, and, after being promoted by
</p>
<p>the dear people, are totally unfit, for want of principle
</p>
<p>and good sense, to manage the affairs of Government.
</p>
<p>Despite all the men on earth and devils damned, we
</p>
<p>will stand by the Constitution and the flag of the
</p>
<p>Union until we die."
</p>
<p>From the time of the publication of the above article
</p>
<p>we became a marked man by many of the partyleaders contemplating secession. We knew it not at
</p>
<p>the time, so gradual and cautious were the means
</p>
<p>used to crush our influence. We were advised to
</p>
<p>" write nothing on political subjects." "The'Banner'
</p>
<p>was a literary and religious journal," and the "organ
</p>
<p>of a religious denomination," and should, therefore,
</p>
<p>refrain from entering into political discussions, for fear

</p>
<p>For ministers to dabble in the muddy, filthy waters
</p>
<p>of politics, we always regarded as a leap from the truly

<p>sublime to the supremely ridiculous. But for ministers to write and talk in defence of their country, is
</p>
<p>patriotic, commendable, honorable, Christian, Godlike;
</p>
<p>and we now deeply regret that we had not devoted

<p>every column of our paper to the cause of our beloved

</p>
<p>in behalf of our country. Now we have no home, no

<p>and an exile from our quiet, peaceful, happy home,

<p>ceive how very annoying it was to see the constant
</p>
<p>preparations f'or war, and to have the war-cry forever
</p>
<p>ringing in his ears, unless he were actually to realize
</p>
<p>it. And this, too, in time of peace and quietness. We
</p>
<p>constantly witnessed this state of things in Fredericksburg during the year 1860, and the reader can form
</p>
<p>some faint idea of the state of affairs by reading the
</p>
<p>following brief editorial published in the "Christian
</p>
<p>Banner," June 7, 1860:"WAR SPIRIT.
</p>
<p>{"The atmosphere, the very element in which we
</p>
<p>live, seems to be pregnant with the spirit of war. All
</p>
<p>the elementary principles of war, death, and carnage
</p>
<p>appear to be in lively exercise all over the world.
</p>
<p>Our exchanges come teeming in upon us filled with
</p>
<p>notices of riots and murders of every kind, and perpetrated by all classes of men, and women too.
</p>
<p>"The very devil seems to be turned loose among the
</p>
<p>people. Battalions are being formed all through the
</p>
<p>South, and sublime and costly preparations for war are
</p>
<p>being made everywhere. The signs of the times indicate that the country is bent and determined on war
</p>
<p>at any and all hazards. Every political move points
</p>
<p>directly to war. Like a desolating pestilence, the disease has infused itself into all classes, male and female,
</p>
<p>old and young. Even the little boys in our town, who
</p>
<p>have scarcely doffed their infant strings, have caught
</p>
<p>the war spirit and formed themselves into nilitary

<p>companies, and perambulate the streets dressed out in

</p>
<p>their shoulders. All this they are permitted to do, to
</p>
<p>the great annoyance of the quiet, business part of the
</p>
<p>men of our town. Surely no people were ever more
</p>
<p>completely under the wild, wicked, and reckless infatuation of the devil than what the American people
</p>
<p>appear to be at the present time. Our country is de-?nented; we fear it is doomed.
</p>
<p>" The people seem to have taken it into their heads
</p>
<p>that there will be war, there must be war, and there
</p>
<p>shall be war. Well, if they will have it, and nothing
</p>
<p>but war will satisfy them, then let them have it and
</p>
<p>enjoy it to their hearts' content. No doubt but that
</p>
<p>many of those brave souls in time of peace who are so
</p>
<p>much bent and determined on war, when it actually
</p>
<p>comes, will be the first to dodge and hide in the bushes
</p>
<p>and brier-hedges, drop into gully-holes, or sneak off
</p>
<p>as deserters and traitors. Many of those fellows who
</p>
<p>are now so active in instigating war, if it come, will
</p>
<p>either have to fight or run; and in either case they will
</p>
<p>be very apt to get killed. Poor laboring-men are not
</p>
<p>going to do all the fighting. Gentlemen will have to
</p>
<p>lend a helping hand, and perform. some active part in
</p>
<p>the drama, before the scene winds up.'Tis right and
</p>
<p>just that those who provoke and force war should die
</p>
<p>in the fight.
</p>
<p>"It may be that war is absolutely necessary at the
</p>
<p>present time, to purify the political and religious
</p>
<p>atmosphere of our country. Both state and church
</p>
<p>have become so corrupt that war, as an instrument to
</p>
<p>sweep off the agents of evil, may prove in the end the
</p>
<p>salvation of our country. A remnant of patriots and

</p>
<p>be taught humility and yield obedience to the statutes
</p>
<p>of Jehovah. War and pestilence may sometimes be as
</p>
<p>essential to the purification and salvation of a country
</p>
<p>as medicine is to the recovering of health and the
</p>
<p>salvation of diseased bodies. In the midst of all our

</p>
<p>Notwithstanding war-preparations were being made
</p>
<p>all over the South, the cry in Virginia was, "There is
</p>
<p>no danger of war,"-while many confidently and conbtantly affirmed that there would be "no war,"-the
</p>
<p>thing was impossible, but still it was " well enough in
</p>
<p>time of peace to prepare for war." Companies were
</p>
<p>formed and drilled as a sort of pastime, and to give an
</p>
<p>air of military dignity and bearing to young men.
</p>
<p>We told them, and that, too, honestly, constantly, and
</p>
<p>faithfully, that they would get their satisfaction of it
</p>
<p>before they were done with it; but they laughed at our

</p>
<p>mocked at our solemn warnings. We were sorry for
</p>
<p>the men, because we saw that a trap was laid to catch
</p>
<p>them, and we were convinced that the leaders would
</p>
<p>prove but too successful in their mighty efforts to ensnare the unwary youth and ignorant classes of the

<p>country. The noose of damnable treason was thrown

</p>
<p>until strangulation and death have ended the sufferings
</p>
<p>of unknown thousands. The Southern heart was "fired
</p>
<p>up," and men were drawn gradually into the horrible
</p>
<p>vortex of ruin before they had even suspected danger.
</p>
<p>The uniform, with all its pretty buttons, shoulder-straps,
</p>
<p>and stripes, was bewitching, and thousands became
</p>
<p>wildly infatuated with the charm. The women, and
</p>
<p>especially the yotng girls, were wonderfully delighted
</p>
<p>with the "beautiful uniforms," and the young men
</p>
<p>donned in uniform were much more popular with the
</p>
<p>girls than young men dressed out in plain citizen's
</p>
<p>clothing. This stimulated others to join companies
</p>
<p>and don the uniform also. Thus the work went on

<p>gradually,-every thing tending to a sure and certain

<p>rebellion against the Federal Government.

<p>"Whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad,

<p>hearts of all patriotic outsiders! We have been
</p>
<p>gravely asked where the'burst up' of the Democratic Convention at Baltimore has left us. So far as
</p>
<p>the actions of the factionists are concerned, we are left
</p>
<p>just nowhere. So far as our own conviction of principles is concerned, we are just where we have always
</p>
<p>been,-a firm, uncompromising, Constitutional -Democrat. We have, however, always been convinced of
</p>
<p>the absolute importance, for the perpetuity and prosperity of our Government, that there should exist at
</p>
<p>least two great political parties, who shall alternately
</p>
<p>wield the affairs of state. And we do devoutly hope
</p>
<p>that two such parties will now be created.
</p>
<p>"That secession is the grand stepping-stone to disunion, or rather disunion itself, we presume none will
</p>
<p>deny. If gentlemen are determined on dividing the
</p>
<p>Union, let them do it. The sooner the better, if it
</p>
<p>must be done. But the sword of retributive justice
</p>
<p>will fall heavily on their own heads. If this Union be
</p>
<p>dissolved, and civil war comes,-and come it will, and
</p>
<p>come it must,-these gentlemen will have to do some
</p>
<p>tall fighting, as certainly as God rules the universe.

<p>Remember this, will you?"
</p>
<p>That the leaders in the Breckinridge party at the
</p>
<p>South had resolved on the overthrow of the Government, in the event that they could not rule it, we suppose, has long since become a settled fact in the minds

<p>of most of the American people. Their whole course

</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of July
</p>
<p>the 26th, 1860, we wrote the following:"The whole political and ecclesiastical world is, at
</p>
<p>this moment, in a state of wild commotion. The waters
</p>
<p>are troubled; the dark waves of mighty revolutions
</p>
<p>are rolling heaven-high and spreading the wide world
</p>
<p>over; political associations and parties are everywhere
</p>
<p>being disbanded; governments are already being overturned, producing great revolutions and undergoing

<p>ominous mutations.
</p>
<p>"Our own happy country has passed through her
</p>
<p>palmiest days; her glory is departing, and will soon be
</p>
<p>gone, and gone forever, unless God in mercy stays the

</p>
<p>good, but politicians are corrupt, base, and vile, and,
</p>
<p>beneath the weight of accumulated guilt, they blindly
</p>
<p>seek their own destruction and the ruin of us all. To
</p>
<p>carry out their own mnalevolent designs, they would

<p>sever the Union, fill our country with blood and flame,
</p>
<p>and reckon their own promotion, their own glory, a

<p>sufficient atonement for all the common ruin.

<p>the banner of freedom has waved so long-now submit

</p>
<p>"Let the devil take the man, or men," &c. &c.. This

<p>expression was caught at by our enemies and handled

<p>very ingeniously to our injury. Some said it was right

<p>down swearing,-absolutely wicked and profane. What

<p>which secession has cursed our whole country, and then

<p>say it is wicked and profane for the sufferers to say,
</p>
<p>"let the devil take the man, or men," who have been
</p>
<p>directly instrumental in bringing all these curses upon
</p>
<p>us. This war has sent thousands of souls in an unprepared state into eternity; it is to a very great extent
</p>
<p>demoralizing the people of the whole nation, both in
</p>
<p>and out of the armies. It has filled a nation with
</p>
<p>mourning, lamentation, deep, heart-felt sorrow and woe;
</p>
<p>it has made and will make thousands of widows and
</p>
<p>millions of orphans. It has blasted and blighted the hopes
</p>
<p>and fairest prospects of millions of men and women;
</p>
<p>it has paralyzed the influence of the Bible and Christianity all over the country. In a word, it has damned
</p>
<p>a nation, at least for the time being. And yet it is
</p>
<p>wicked and profane for a minister to say, "let the devil

</p>
<p>in the simple but emphatic expression, "Let the devil

<p>take the man, or men," who would sacrifice the lives
</p>
<p>of thousands and the happiness of millions on the altar
</p>
<p>of their own wicked, ungodly ambition. We said this
</p>
<p>long before the war commenced, and we said it, because, reasoning from cause to effect, we knew what
</p>
<p>would certainly come to pass "in the event of certain
</p>
<p>contingencies," which was a very common saying with

<p>a certain class of politicians about the time we made

<p>produce revolution; that revolution would inaugurate

<p>the institution of African slavery, and dissolve society,
</p>
<p>and introduce infinities of curses and evils upon the

</p>
<p>sion, in the event that Lincoln is elected President of
</p>
<p>these United States. WVe think that chances at present are altogether favorable to his election. If the Democratic parties would coalesce and centre on one man,
</p>
<p>Lincoln's defeat would be almost certain. This, however, we can hardly hope for, as matters now stand.
</p>
<p>" If the Democratic parties and the Unionists would
</p>
<p>unite on one man, the Black Republicans would certainly be defeated, and the salvation of our country
</p>
<p>would be preserved, at least for the present. If all the
</p>
<p>candidates remain in the field, it is reduced to almost a
</p>
<p>mathematical certainty that neither Bell nor any one
</p>
<p>of the Democratic candidates can be elected. They
</p>
<p>mutually weaken the forcp of each other, and strengthen
</p>
<p>the Black Republican party. Is this wisdom? Is it
</p>
<p>patriotic? It is neither.
</p>
<p>"Would not the Government be safe, and the Union
</p>
<p>preserved, in the event of the election either of Bell or
</p>
<p>of any one of the Democratic candidates? We firmly
</p>
<p>believe they would. Then, the salvation of our country
</p>
<p>is now in the hands of these parties. They can save
</p>
<p>the Union, if they will. All must admit this. If they
</p>
<p>can save it, and will not, then let them be anathema
</p>
<p>maranatha.

<p>"They are like those bigoted religionists who would
</p>
<p>rather blow up all heaven, and let the devil take the
</p>
<p>whole, than that men should go to heaven in any other
</p>
<p>way than that which they prescribe. Are they not? Is
</p>
<p>this the spirit by which the leaders of these parties are
</p>
<p>influenced? From present appearances, it would seem
</p>
<p>so. No one can question the happy results of afusion of
</p>
<p>all these political parties, the preservation of the Union,

</p>
<p>What man of sense can for a moment believe it?

<p>" Was it an amicable secession and a peaceable separation when the colonies of these United States seceded

<p>from the usurpation of British tyranny? Was it an

<p>amicable secession and a peaceable separation when the
</p>
<p>Southern Methodist Conferences seceded from the

<p>these two great ecclesiastical bodies? Was it peaceable all along the border line? Was it peaceable in

<p>the question. Let their pugnacious editors, the belligerent effusions of their newspapers, the incendiary

<p>harangues of their clerical stump-speakers, their criminations and recriminations, and their long and malignant litigations, answer the question.

<p>our country?' No: we have no country: it is lost in
</p>
<p>the deep, dark vortex of political corruption.'For
</p>
<p>what are we fighting? For liberty?' No: the canvas
</p>
<p>of our Stars and Stripes is torn into a thousand fragments and wafted to the four winds of heaven, and

<p>our liberty is wrested from us.' Whom are we fighting? A foreign enemy?' No: our brothers, our

<p>sons, our fathers, our own countrymen.'What shall
</p>
<p>we gain if we achieve the victory? Liberty, peace,
</p>
<p>prosperity, and happiness?' No: these have all been
</p>
<p>violently and basely wrested from us by despotic politicians, who, as soon as we have fought their battles
</p>
<p>and gained the victory, will place the iron heel of petty
</p>
<p>despotism on our necks and will grind us into dust.

<p>In the Revolutionary struggle our fathers fought for

<p>and those who are permanently located and have property to defend and interests at stake will find themselves surrounded by enemies on every hand, when it

</p>
<p>Is he a sound constitutional man? Will his election
</p>
<p>calm the boiling whirlpool of political agitation and
</p>
<p>strife, and secure the salvation of the Union? What
</p>
<p>citizen, we ask, who loves his country, would refuse to

<p>us as a disunionist. Suppose we vote for Douglas? He

<p>is a Democrat. Then the Breckinridge party would

<p>part, continue until his term expires. If he shall violate
</p>
<p>his constitutional rights, let him be dealt with accordingly. What else can be done?"
</p>
<p>And now, reader, we must close this chapter, having
</p>
<p>extended our remarks on this subject far beyond what
</p>
<p>we intended; but it is a subject which fires up our whole
</p>
<p>soul. What is life without a happy, peaceful home?
</p>
<p>And how can this be enjoyed without a happy, peaceful
</p>
<p>country? It cannot. But we must close, and leave
</p>
<p>other questions for future chapters.
</p>
<p>We urged a fusion of the Bell and Douglas parties
</p>
<p>because there was no material issue of any important
</p>
<p>character between them so far as we could observe. They
</p>
<p>seemed to harmonize throughout. The Douglas electors
</p>
<p>argued that he was an uncompromising Union man,that he was the regular nominee of the National Democratic party,-that he had done more, suffered more,
</p>
<p>and had been more reviled for the support he had given
</p>
<p>to the South than any other living man. The only
</p>
<p>objection to his political principles appeared to be his
</p>
<p>devotion to what was termed " Squatter Sovereignty."
</p>
<p>He was eulogized by the Bell electors, and Bell was
</p>
<p>lauded by the Douglas electors. Hence it seemed
</p>
<p>strange to us that these two parties would not coalesce
</p>
<p>for the sake of saving the Union; especially when the
</p>
<p>electors of both these parties denounced the Breckinridge party as disunionists.
</p>
<p>The electors of the Breckinridge party in Virginia
</p>
<p>indignantly repelled the charge of being disunionists,
</p>
<p>unless "in the event of certain contingencies," which,
</p>
<p>in plain English, simply meant, If Lincoln is elected then

<p>37
</p>
<p>break up the Government. They were exceedingly
</p>
<p>cautious on this question, for fear the party might lose
</p>
<p>influence. Yancey and Newton had already avowed
</p>
<p>themselves as being disunionists, but they were "isolated exceptions;" they were by no means the proper
</p>
<p>and fair "exponents" of the party. It was our devotion to the Union, and our very soul's desire that our
</p>
<p>country might be saved, that influenced us to urge a
</p>
<p>fusion of any two or of all three of these parties. We
</p>
<p>felt that we were willing to make any sacrifice for the
</p>
<p>salvation of the country, and we thought that others
</p>
<p>ought to do the same. They think so, too, now.

</p>
<p>Can it be possible that all this strife, and war, and

<p>noise, and excitement all over the country is gotten up

<p>by politicians for political ends? If this be true, politicians are a set of greater knaves and scoundrels than

<p>we had even supposed. Whether they design the dissolution of the Union or not, or whether the Union will

<p>from the contest, entirely? Would not such a course

<p>immortalize them through all time in the hearts of the

<p>American people? Suppose Douglas was to withdraw

<p>his name from the contest, and say,'Fellow-citizens,
</p>
<p>I fear that by having so many candidates in the field
</p>
<p>we shall all defeat ourselves and elect a common

<p>enemy, and thereby hazard the safety and salvation

<p>of the Union. Therefore I withdraw my name, and
</p>
<p>shall throw all my influence on the strongest candidate,
</p>
<p>-whether he be Bell or Breckinridge,-and thus try
</p>
<p>to defeat our common enemy.' An act so magnanimous and patriotic, at such a crisis as the present,
</p>
<p>would immortalize Douglas, and make the people love
</p>
<p>him, whether they had wished to do so or not. If Mr.
</p>
<p>Douglas, Breckinridge, or Bell were to act thus, their

<p>election in 1864 and 1868-first the one and then the

<p>Bell and Breckinridge have both turned traitors to
</p>
<p>their country; and their names will go down to posterity steeped in national treason and covered with
</p>
<p>political infamy.

</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of September 27, 1860, under the head of " Random Thoughts
</p>
<p>Shot at a Venture," we wrote the following leading
</p>
<p>editorial:" Great God, reader, we are astonished beyond measure! The whole world is rolling on through immeasurable space, and all nature, animate and inanimate,
</p>
<p>rational and irrational, the whole body politic, and
</p>
<p>every particle, separately and singly, seem convulsed
</p>
<p>from centre to circumference.
</p>
<p>"That the whole world is on the fearful brink of a
</p>
<p>terribly sublime revolution, we do not entertain a
</p>
<p>doubt. As to the results of the maddening question
</p>
<p>which is now agitating every heart in this great and
</p>
<p>grand country of ours, the least we can do is simply to
</p>
<p>give our opinion, as many of our readers have earnestly
</p>
<p>solicited us to do. This, in part, is our apology for
</p>
<p>the matter contained in this chapter of'Random

<p>Thoughts.'

<p>the American people begging popular suffrage for the
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>Presidency of these United States. The friends of
</p>
<p>Lincoln, the Black Republican candidate, are moving
</p>
<p>heaven and earth to secure his election. We think it
</p>
<p>more than probable, unless a fusion of other parties take place, that Lincoln will be elected by the
</p>
<p>popular vote of the people. Neither Bell, Breckinridge, nor Douglas can be elected by the popular vote
</p>
<p>of the people, if all three candidates remain in the
</p>
<p>field. This is a fixed fact, which the most obtuse intellect cannot mistake. If, therefore, neither Bell, Douglas,
</p>
<p>nor Breckinridge can be elected by the people if all
</p>
<p>three continue candidates, and if these parties actually
</p>
<p>believe that the election of Lincoln will consummate
</p>
<p>a dissolution of the Union, why, as patriots and friends
</p>
<p>of the Union, do they not unite their influence on one
</p>
<p>man, and thus defeat Lincoln and save the Union?
</p>
<p>They remind us of certain stubborn, refractory persons
</p>
<p>who would break up and destroy the peace and harmony of heaven itself, unless they can have things
</p>
<p>their own way. What pleasure can it be to all three
</p>
<p>of these parties simply to defeat one another? They'll'cut off their noses to spite their faces.' They'll
</p>
<p>achieve great victories and win immortal honors, will
</p>
<p>they? Mark what we say. If they persist in their
</p>
<p>reckless, ruinous course, the career of their political
</p>
<p>glory will wind up at the close of the present Presidential canvass,-and that, too, with the election of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln! Who will hereafter trust men who, without
</p>
<p>any just cause, will jeopardize the peace, harmony, and
</p>
<p>salvation of a whole nation? None but madmen!
</p>
<p>"'Why,' we are asked,'do we attend political meetings?' First, because we feel deeply interested in the

</p>
<p>thoroughly understand the principles and true positions
</p>
<p>of the parties. Secondly, because we wish to be able
</p>
<p>to advise our readers correctly, which we cannot do if
</p>
<p>we are ignorant on these subjects ourself. Thirdly,
</p>
<p>because we love to hear'smart' men'talk,' whether
</p>
<p>we agree with them or not.
</p>
<p>"' Well,what's the difference between them? What's
</p>
<p>the great bone of contention?' What? Why, the
</p>
<p>almost invisible shade of a shadow,-intervention, or
</p>
<p>non-interventiom!
</p>
<p>"Congress cannot constitutionally legislate slavery
</p>
<p>into a State or Territory, nor can she legislate it out.
</p>
<p>She can only protect it where it exists by the organic
</p>
<p>law of the State or Territory. Congress cannot legislate slavery into the State of Ohio, nor can she legislate it out of Virginia. It is all a'fuss kicked up'
</p>
<p>about nothing. There is not a single Federal question
</p>
<p>or principle of any importance introduced into the
</p>
<p>canvass by any one of the parties as an issue between
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>"The great question is this:-Shall the South continue
</p>
<p>her'social existence' or not? In other words, shall
</p>
<p>the institution of slavery be perpetuated, and shall
</p>
<p>slave territory be extended, or not? We have listened
</p>
<p>to able addresses from Douglas, Breckinridge, and
</p>
<p>Bell electors, and have tried to analyze the specific
</p>
<p>difference between them all. The Bell and Douglas
</p>
<p>men seem to harmonize throughout. Bell electors
</p>
<p>eulogize Douglas to the very heavens, but charge the
</p>
<p>Breckinridge party with the awful sin of being disunionists, bent and determined on breaking up and

</p>
<p>dissolving this glorious Confederacy of States. Douglas
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED,
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>electors charge on the Breckinridge party the same
</p>
<p>design.
</p>
<p>"Do the Douglas and Bell parties actually believe in
</p>
<p>their hearts, or do they honestly believe, that the Breckinridge party is composed of disunionists? Or is this
</p>
<p>a political stratagem to widen the breach between the
</p>
<p>Douglas and Breckinridge parties for the purpose of
</p>
<p>so far weakening the Breckinridge party as to defeat
</p>
<p>Breckinridge in Virginia and to secure the State for
</p>
<p>Bell? Every vote that shall be cast for Douglas will
</p>
<p>weaken the Breckinridge party, and give strength to
</p>
<p>Bell. Why? Because there is no possible chance for
</p>
<p>Douglas to gain Virginia. Why, then, throw away
</p>
<p>votes on him?
</p>
<p>"Why will not the Douglas men, if they are so fearful of a dissolution of the Union and believe that the
</p>
<p>object and aim of the Breckinridge party is to break
</p>
<p>up and dissolve the Union, unite with the Bell party
</p>
<p>at once, and make sure of his election so far as the
</p>
<p>vote of Virginia is concerned? And, again, why will
</p>
<p>not the Bell party unite with the Douglas party, if
</p>
<p>they have the exalted opinion of Douglas which they
</p>
<p>say they have? In either case, the vote of Virginia
</p>
<p>would be cast for a sound conservative, constitutional
</p>
<p>candidate, according to the acknowledgments of each
</p>
<p>one of these parties.
</p>
<p>"Why is it, then, in fearful and critical times like the
</p>
<p>present, that these two parties, harmonizing as they do,
</p>
<p>will not fuse at once, and set the noble example for
</p>
<p>other sister States to follow?
</p>
<p>"Look at it, reader, will you? If the Bell and Douglas parties throughout the United States would unite

<p>either on Bell or Douglas, they could and certainly

<p>46
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>would defeat the'disunionists' of the South and the
</p>
<p>Black Republicans of the North. Will they do it?
</p>
<p>"If they see the deep, dark,'hellish' plot to dissolve
</p>
<p>the Union, and can defeat the'infernal' design of
</p>
<p>these'black-hearted traitors,' and will not do it, are
</p>
<p>they any better than the disunionists themselves? An
</p>
<p>enemy has our infant child in his hands, preparing to
</p>
<p>precipitate it down an awful precipice; we have the
</p>
<p>power to arrest the enemy and save our child from
</p>
<p>ruin, but refuse to do it: are we any better than he
</p>
<p>who actually commits the deed?
</p>
<p>"Look at it, will you? Here are two large political
</p>
<p>parties, each avowing that they believe a third political
</p>
<p>party in their very midst is plotting and scheming a
</p>
<p>conspiracy against our common country, which, if consummated, will inevitably involve all parties and our
</p>
<p>whole country in irretrievable ruin, and these two
</p>
<p>parties by uniting their undivided forces and influence
</p>
<p>can defeat the whole scheme and save all parties and
</p>
<p>the whole country from ruin; and still they refuse to
</p>
<p>do it! Can they be sincere in what they say? If so,
</p>
<p>can they be regarded as patriots?
</p>
<p>"Think, will you? This is a grave subject, one
</p>
<p>with which no man can trifle with impunity. We say
</p>
<p>nothing against either of these two parties. We look
</p>
<p>at the whole subject impartially, free from all prejudice,
</p>
<p>and we earnestly hope our readers will do the same.
</p>
<p>However much we may admire either Bell or Douglas,
</p>
<p>or both, as statesmen, we love and admire our country
</p>
<p>more.

</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>men as Governor Wise, Governor Smith, Hunter, Sedden, and a host of others whom we could name, are
</p>
<p>ignorant of the deep-laid scheme to dissolve the Union?
</p>
<p>If they are not ignorant of the'infernal' plot, and
</p>
<p>know it to exist, can it be possible that they will become accomplices in a work which, if accomplished,
</p>
<p>will damn them politically, ruin them financially, and
</p>
<p>annihilate their social existence? Is it possible that
</p>
<p>they are such consummate fools as not to be able to see
</p>
<p>the results? and, if they see them, can they be so wicked
</p>
<p>and reckless as to persist in a course which must inevitably end in death, and the common ruin of us all,
</p>
<p>and the ruin of our whole country?
</p>
<p>"Look at it, will you? If the cotton States are so
</p>
<p>blind and infatuated as to believe it wonld be to their
</p>
<p>financial interest to dissolve the Union and establish a
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy and reopen the African slavetrade, it cannot possibly be to the interest of Virginia.
</p>
<p>So far from it, it would involve her in universal and
</p>
<p>irretrievable bankruptcy. If cotton-planters could
</p>
<p>obtain laboring-hands from Africa for one hundred
</p>
<p>dollars per head, they would never think of paying
</p>
<p>Virginians from five hundred to two thousand dollars
</p>
<p>per head for laborers! Think of that, will you? Virginians have no large cotton, rice, and sugar plantations to cultivate. What then becomes of her negroes?
</p>
<p>And they increase like rabbits! Where will you send
</p>
<p>them? Nowhere; for there will be no market for
</p>
<p>them. What can you get for them? Comparatively
</p>
<p>nothing. They shall be sold, and, in fact, no man shall
</p>
<p>buy them. The insignificant sum which they would
</p>
<p>command would not be regarded as any price at all.

</p>
<p>bellion, and insurrection, what would be the result?
</p>
<p>The whole of the cotton States would be flooded with
</p>
<p>transported Africans and native negroes, and there
</p>
<p>would be, in all probability, in many sections fifty, if
</p>
<p>not one hundred, negroes for every white man. Then,

<p>what? Is the reader so blind as not to see, what?,'Send for help.' Where? To the ZNorth? Think
</p>
<p>you that the North would come to the rescue of the
</p>
<p>South in such emergencies to suppress negro insurrections? No: there would be no help obtained from any
</p>
<p>of the free States. This is a fixed fact.'Send to
</p>
<p>Virginia.' The idea is ludicrous! Send to Virginia
</p>
<p>for help, when she is crowded with like enemies and

<p>subject to like dangers? What man of sense and
</p>
<p>feeling would leave his own wife and children unprotected to go to the rescue of strangers abroad? Pause
</p>
<p>and think, reader! This is a terribly fearful subject
</p>
<p>to contemplate!
</p>
<p>"' Nor is this all. Men living in the same counties
</p>
<p>and adjacent counties would not leave their own
</p>
<p>houses willingly to go to aid others, knowing that
</p>
<p>their own families were unprotected and in danger

<p>every hour. We are giving no fancy sketch, nor false

<p>which will certainly be realized in the event of a dissolution of the Union.

<p>"'But we have the fullest confidence in our negroes.'

<p>You have! Well, then, we are frank to confess that
</p>
<p>we have not.'Oh,' say some,'our negroes are

<p>negroes would not take Smith's life, but they despise
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACtRIFICED.
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>Jones, and will murder him and his family, and burn
</p>
<p>up his property. Do you not see? These horrible
</p>
<p>tragedies will be acted. out if the Union be dissolved.
</p>
<p>"'But this is all fancy-work.' Dissolve the Union,
</p>
<p>and you will soon see whether it is fancy or reality.
</p>
<p>The fact is, there is no confidence to be placed in the
</p>
<p>negroes at such times and under such circumstances.
</p>
<p>And the South, instead of bringing more and more
</p>
<p>negroes into her territories, would be very willing to
</p>
<p>have them all back in Africa under any circumstances.
</p>
<p>Remember this!
</p>
<p>"Think, will you? Precisely in proportion to the
</p>
<p>increase of negroes and their decline in value would
</p>
<p>the labor of white men decrease. Who would give a
</p>
<p>white man one hundred dollars per annum to work his
</p>
<p>farm, if he could get a negro man for fifty dollars per
</p>
<p>annum to do the same work? No one. As the country would become glutted with negroes, the laboring
</p>
<p>class of white men would be forced to seek new homes.
</p>
<p>"Again, much reliance seems by many to be placed
</p>
<p>in laboring white men, in case of danger, who never
</p>
<p>have been, and who never expect to be, the owners of
</p>
<p>slaves. So far as the fidelity to the South (or to the
</p>
<p>institution of slavery) is concerned of this class of men,
</p>
<p>we are bold to confess that we have but little faith in
</p>
<p>them when it comes to fighting about negroes. They
</p>
<p>will be for taking care of themselves, and will leave
</p>
<p>slave-holders to defend themselves as best they can, in
</p>
<p>the hour of danger. We have but little confidence in
</p>
<p>the great majority of this class of the people of the
</p>
<p>South in a war for the perpetuity of slavery and the
</p>
<p>extension of slave territory. Men who have neither

</p>
<p>planters, will hardly put their own lives in danger to
</p>
<p>protect those who have never treated them with even
</p>
<p>common respect. Reader, think, will you? This is a
</p>
<p>practical article. No theory about it.
</p>
<p>"In view of all these facts, can it be possible that
</p>
<p>there are slave-holders in Virginia, and in our very
</p>
<p>midst, who are working for a dissolution of this Union?
</p>
<p>If they wish such a result, they certainly cannot be
</p>
<p>sane. If, therefore, Breckinridge men in Virginia are
</p>
<p>disunionists, for God's sake let them openly avow
</p>
<p>themselves. We say nothing against either the Bell,
</p>
<p>Douglas, or Breckinridge party, nor shall we, until
</p>
<p>we perceive their ultimate designs. And we would
</p>
<p>advise all our readers not to be too hasty in jumping
</p>
<p>to conclusions and committing themselves too soon in
</p>
<p>this canvass.
</p>
<p>"Our own opinion may be very different to-morrow,
</p>
<p>a week, or a month hence, from what it is to-day.
</p>
<p>We have neither declared ourself for Bell, Douglas,
</p>
<p>nor for Breckinridge. We have thrown out these
</p>
<p>hints for the benefit of our readers, who are not blessed
</p>
<p>with the facilities of reading many of the newspapers
</p>
<p>of the day. As we have said before, we now repeat,
</p>
<p>that, if we vote at all, we shall cast our vote for the
</p>
<p>man whom we think most likely to carry the State of
</p>
<p>Virginia, and thus far defeat the election of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln.
</p>
<p>"As to our opinion about Lincoln's administration
</p>
<p>if elected, we can only say that he may, or he may
</p>
<p>not, discharge the duties of his office to the satisfaction
</p>
<p>of the people of the United States. A nation's eye

<p>enforce the Constitution, it will be the duty of all
</p>
<p>parties to respect his administration, although they
</p>
<p>may have but little respect for the man.
</p>
<p>" And now, reader, we will close this article by earnestly entreating you to ponder this subject thoroughly. Let passion and prejudice find -no restingplace either in your mind or heart. Remember, this is
</p>
<p>a subject in which your happiness and that of our
</p>
<p>whole country are involved. Say not that you will
</p>
<p>support either Bell, Breckinridge, or Douglas, under
</p>
<p>any and all circumstances. Remain open to conviction until the very day before the election. Learn all
</p>
<p>you can, and, when you cast your vote, let it be done
</p>
<p>rationally, conscientiously, patriotically, fearlessly, and
</p>
<p>manly, and then if things do not turn out well you
</p>
<p>will have the peaceful assurance that you acted as you
</p>
<p>thought for the best. If you are a Douglas or a
</p>
<p>Breckinridge Democrat, and find that neither of these
</p>
<p>men can carry the State, and that chances are strong
</p>
<p>for Bell, then secure his election by casting your vote
</p>
<p>for him. If, however, you find that chances are strong
</p>
<p>against him, vote for the next strongest man. And
</p>
<p>so we would advise the Union or Bell party. This is
</p>
<p>the course on which we have determined, and we,
</p>
<p>therefore, advise our friends to do likewise. May
</p>
<p>God bless all the people, and save our country forever i"
</p>
<p>It will be observed that the one great idea and grand
</p>
<p>object with us was the preservation of the Union.

<p>that. All the electors of Bell, Douglas, and [Breck.

</p>
<p>if elected, to make war on the institutions of the South,that his long-cherished object was to abolish slavery in
</p>
<p>the South. Hence our uncompromising opposition to
</p>
<p>his election. The disunionists of some of the Southern
</p>
<p>States, particularly South Carolina, had avowed their
</p>
<p>determination to secede from the Union in the event
</p>
<p>of the election of Mr. Lincoln. This the Douglas and
</p>
<p>Bell parties seemed perfectly to understand, and they
</p>
<p>charged this design upon the Breckinridge party in
</p>
<p>Virginia during the Presidential canvass. But the
</p>
<p>Breckinridge electors repelled the charge as a political
</p>
<p>slander, gotten up by the other parties out of which to
</p>
<p>make political capital. To us the idea seemed so preposterously absurd and suicidal for Virginia to secede,
</p>
<p>that we could not believe that such men as Hunter,
</p>
<p>Wise, Smith, Sedden, &c. &c., would lend their influence to accomplish a work so ruinous, so damnable to
</p>
<p>Virginia and every interest which sLe held near and

</p>
<p>Subsequent developments convince us that all the
</p>
<p>leading politicians of the Breckinridge party at the

<p>South were privy to the "infernal" plot of conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the Republic, and had leagued together to
</p>
<p>break up the Government in the event that they were

<p>defeated in the election of Breckinridge. Had Breckinridge been elected, and they remained in office, which
</p>
<p>they certainly would, then would there have been no

<p>secession, no revolution, and no civil war at the present

<p>time. Their motto was, Rule or ruin.

<p>were not the leading politicians of the Breckinridge

<p>his actions? Had Floyd no advisers, aiders, nor abettors in this vast and responsible undertaking? Did

<p>he assume the whole responsibility himself, having no

<p>the munitions of war all over the South? Who can

<p>admit an idea so supremely absurd?
</p>
<p>The "infernal" plot of treason against the Republic

</p>
<p>devotion to the Union we were already marked by some
</p>
<p>as being a traitor to our own native, our own beloved
</p>
<p>South. Because of our devotion to the South, and the
</p>
<p>undying love we had for Virginia, the State of our
</p>
<p>adoption, we so earnestly and constantly opposed disunion, and the damnable political heresy, secession.
</p>
<p>We knew that to destroy the whole was to destroy all
</p>
<p>its parts. The South was a part, and, with us, a very
</p>
<p>material part, of the Union; and we knew that to destroy the whole Union was to destroy our part of the
</p>
<p>Union. And hence it was that we so earnestly and constantly plead against the destruction of the Union. If
</p>
<p>to oppose traitors, and expose treason against our beloved country, constitute one a traitor to the South,
</p>
<p>then we plead guilty to the charge. It is useless to
</p>
<p>say that our devotion to the Union, and our untiring
</p>
<p>efforts to save the South, and especially Virginia, from
</p>
<p>ruin, cost us much. Patronage went from us like
</p>
<p>drifted snow beneath the rays of a vertical sun. But
</p>
<p>we heeded it not. We felt willing to sacrifice every
</p>
<p>thing, and life itself, if necessary, so that our country
</p>
<p>might be saved. And, so help us God, we had rather
</p>
<p>be a refugee, as we now are, from every local interest
</p>
<p>on earth, with all the odium of traitors heaped upon
</p>
<p>us, than to be Jeff Davis, with all the laurels that
</p>
<p>shall ever wreath his brow, and all the wealth of the
</p>
<p>whole Southern Confederacy. We love our country,
</p>
<p>our whole country, and the South in particular; and
</p>
<p>for our country, and our particular part of it, we are
</p>
<p>now writing.

<p>"Much reliance seems by many to be placed in laboring white men, in case of danger, who never have
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>been and never expect to be the owners of slaves. So
</p>
<p>far as the fidelity to the South (or the institution oI
</p>
<p>slavery) is concerned, of this class of men, we are bold
</p>
<p>to confess that we have but little faith in them when it
</p>
<p>comes to fighting about negroes. They will be for
</p>
<p>taking care of themselves, and will leave slave-holders
</p>
<p>to defend themselves as best they can, in the hour of
</p>
<p>danger. We have but little confidence in the great
</p>
<p>majority of this class of the people of the South in a
</p>
<p>war for the perpetuity of slavery and the extension of
</p>
<p>slave territory. Men who have neither land nor negroes, and are treated and looked down on with contempt by these lordly cotton, rice, and sugar planters,
</p>
<p>will hardly put their own lives in danger to protect
</p>
<p>those who have never treated them with even common
</p>
<p>respect."
</p>
<p>We deem it necessary to make a few remarks in
</p>
<p>explanation of the above, lest our views should be misconstrued by the reader. We have never questioned
</p>
<p>the loyalty and patriotism of the poor class of white
</p>
<p>men in the South, nor their devotion to their section
</p>
<p>of country. That they are as true patriots, and are as
</p>
<p>much devoted to their country, as the richer class of
</p>
<p>citizens, we suppose none will deny. But to fight and
</p>
<p>die for one's country, is one thing; and to fight and die
</p>
<p>for the institution of African slavery, is quite another
</p>
<p>thing, and especially with those who have but little or
</p>
<p>no interest in its perpetuity, or the extension of its
</p>
<p>territory.
</p>
<p>In our calculations, above stated, we were not mistaken.

<p>" How is it, then, that so many poor men are in the
</p>
<p>56
</p>

</p>
<p>Southern army?" Thousands of them are not there
</p>
<p>of choice. In the commencement of the making up of
</p>
<p>and the organizing of the Southern army, men were
</p>
<p>told that their services would only be required for a
</p>
<p>few months; that, in fact, there would be no war,
</p>
<p>and, to make the most of it, it would be nothing more
</p>
<p>than a holiday-frolic. Others were organized as HomeGuards, with assurances given to them that they should
</p>
<p>never leave their own neighborhoods or counties, and,
</p>
<p>in the event of war in reality, they would not be
</p>
<p>pressed into service, being already members of companies for home-protection. Thousands had no employment, and, as a matter of necessity, were forced into
</p>
<p>the army to keep from starvation. Others were told
</p>
<p>that, if they had to leave their homes at all, it would
</p>
<p>only be for a short period; that they should not go out
</p>
<p>of their States, and that they should have the privilege of visiting their homes every few weeks, and that
</p>
<p>the travel would be at Government expense and would
</p>
<p>cost them nothing.
</p>
<p>At length, when the appearances of war in the
</p>
<p>spring of 1861 became more and more palpable, and
</p>
<p>the militia were ordered out in Virginia,-thousands
</p>
<p>were persuaded to volunteer to escape being drafted;
</p>
<p>as volunteers stood higher, were better treated and
</p>
<p>better paid than the militia. Every sort of means
</p>
<p>were resorted to in order to induce and force men to
</p>
<p>volunteer. Whenever Government wanted to raise
</p>
<p>troops, "Drafting! drafting! drafting!" was the cry.
</p>
<p>"The militia are called out!" "The militia are called
</p>
<p>out!" And men everywhere were frightened, for fear
</p>
<p>they would be drafted. Fredericksburg was one of the

</p>
<p>they met, and remained for more than a week, early in
</p>
<p>the summer of 1861. We heard the men talk, learned
</p>
<p>their views, and know that they did not go willingly
</p>
<p>into the service, notwithstanding they volunteered. Of
</p>
<p>two great evils  to be drafted or volunteer- they
</p>
<p>chose, as they thought, the least, and volunteered.
</p>
<p>Matters worked-or rather dragged-on in this way
</p>
<p>until the Conscript Act was passed by the Confederate
</p>
<p>Congress, and then there was no redress-no escape.
</p>
<p>All had to go. Did they go willingly? Ask their
</p>
<p>suffering wives and starving children. Ask the scouts
</p>
<p>who hunted them up and hurried them away from their
</p>
<p>homes at all hours of the night. And when this war
</p>
<p>shall have ended, and these poor men return home, 
</p>
<p>if they shall be so fortunate as to do so,-they will
</p>
<p>answer for themselves, and will tell stories of woe and
</p>
<p>sufferings that will almost chill the blood of the listeners. And, finally, liquor had much to do in making up
</p>
<p>companies for the war. When sober, men would swear
</p>
<p>they would never join the army, but, so soon as they
</p>
<p>were put under the influence of liquor, they would
</p>
<p>"enlist." And all this for what? To aid a set of
</p>
<p>traitors in establishing an infernal negro oligarchy down
</p>
<p>in the Gulf States, who would have no more respect nor
</p>
<p>regard for the poor soldiers who had suffered and fought
</p>
<p>their battles for them, than they would for their negroes

<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>THE ELECTION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN NO JUST CAUSE
</p>
<p>FOR THE SECESSION OF ANY STATE, ETC.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of October 11, 1860, we wrote the following paragraph, in
</p>
<p>answer to correspondents requesting us to give our
</p>
<p>opinion as to the result of the Presidential election:
</p>
<p>" We are asked how we think Virginia will go in the
</p>
<p>Presidential election. Of course, we cannot tell. Our
</p>
<p>opinion, however, is, that the contest lies between
</p>
<p>Breckinridge and Bell, and that Breckinridge will
</p>
<p>carry the State. This is our honest conviction, from
</p>
<p>the facts now before us.
</p>
<p>"As to the final result of the Presidential election,
</p>
<p>there is but little doubt in our mind, but that Lincoln
</p>
<p>will be the next President of these United States. If
</p>
<p>he should be, we again say to our readers, prepare to
</p>
<p>discharge your duties as loyal citizens to your country,
</p>
<p>and firmly supporting the Constitution of the Federal
</p>
<p>Government.
</p>
<p>"The election of Abraham Lincoln, by the people of
</p>
<p>these United States, to the Presidency, is no just cause
</p>
<p>for the secession of any State or States. If Lincoln
</p>
<p>should be elected, we hope the Southern people will act
</p>
<p>with that prudence and discretion which shall secure to

<p>59
</p>
<p>That this is to their interest, and to the interest of our
</p>
<p>common country, all sensible men must allow. We
</p>
<p>make these remarks because we feel it to be our duty
</p>
<p>to prepare the minds of our readers for the worst that
</p>
<p>may come. Should Lincoln act well his part, and the
</p>
<p>people act well their part, all will be well."
</p>
<p>Because we constantly advocated the Union and the
</p>
<p>strict observance of the Constitution of the Federal
</p>
<p>Government, and wrote in the conciliatory style which
</p>
<p>we uniformly did, it was an easy matter to associate
</p>
<p>our name and principles, and those of Union men generally, with "Old Abe Lincoln and the Black tRepublicans" of the North. This infamously slanderous work
</p>
<p>our enemies engaged in and executed with a zeal and
</p>
<p>ardor worthy a better cause. To all their indignities,
</p>
<p>however, we submitted for the sake of our common

</p>
<p>TIEE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>Banner" of November 1, 1860, the following remarks,
</p>
<p>under the head of "Random Thoughts Shot at a
</p>
<p>Venture:""The Greatest Study of ifankind is Man."
</p>
<p>"The country here is in a state of general excitement. Fairs, pole-raisings, barbecues, political meetings, and religious meetings, all help to keep up the
</p>
<p>whirl, and roll on the tide of general excitement.
</p>
<p>"Here they have the Douglas party, the Bell party,
</p>
<p>and the Breckinridge party, just as the people have
</p>
<p>them in the Old D)ominion. The Douglas party is
</p>
<p>comparatively small in this State; but the Bell party
</p>
<p>hope it will be sufficiently large to defeat Breckinridge,
</p>
<p>and thus give the State to Bell. The facts in the case,
</p>
<p>however, will soon be demonstrated. As yet, we have
</p>
<p>heard no one express himself as being a disunionist.
</p>
<p>Our opinion is, that the State is conservative, and will go
</p>
<p>for protecting and saving the Union even if Lincoln
</p>
<p>should be elected. God save our country! should be
</p>
<p>the wish, fervent and constant prayer, of every American citizen. Without the blessings of our God and our
</p>
<p>country, we are all just nothing and nobody. Think
</p>
<p>of that, will you?
</p>
<p>"Be the result what it may, before God, we feel that
</p>
<p>we have constantly and faithfully discharged our duty
</p>
<p>to our readers. We have earnestly urged a union of
</p>
<p>the Bell, Breckinridge, and Douglas parties, and have
</p>
<p>feebly and imperfectly foreshadowed the awful evils
</p>
<p>which must inevitably result and befall our country if
</p>
<p>precipitated into a revolution. The horrors of such an

</p>
<p>Mark this, reader; and when it actually comes to
</p>
<p>pass, then say if we predicted falsely!
</p>
<p>"The Southern and border States will be the stage
</p>
<p>on which the most tragical scenes will be acted out,
</p>
<p>while the whole civilized world will realize the terribly
</p>
<p>paralyzing effects of the awful convulsion. Aspiring
</p>
<p>would-be despots may now think that they will rise and
</p>
<p>shine on petty thrones, and sway infernal sceptres over
</p>
<p>a crushed and ruined people; but, in the stead of this,
</p>
<p>they will sink so deep into the whirlpool of political,
</p>
<p>national, and eternal infamy, that the long and strong
</p>
<p>arm of Omnipotence can never, never reach them more;
</p>
<p>while the woes and wails of the dead and dying, and a
</p>
<p>nation's curse, will follow their anathematized ghosts to
</p>
<p>the lowest depths of the profoundest hell, there to haunt
</p>
<p>them as long as God shall be and eternity shall roll her
</p>
<p>ample sweep.
</p>
<p>"Is there-can there be-any redemption or salvation for him who, to effect his own demoniacal, ambitious aspirations, would establish his throne on the blood

<p>and bones and ashes of his fellow-citizens, and the

<p>downfall and eternal ruin of his whole country? Think,

<p>reader! God bless you, think of the awfully terrible

<p>results which will follow secession and a dissolution of

</p>
<p>In the number of the "Christian Banner" of November 15, we wrote the following paragraphs. They
</p>
<p>were written and sent to the publisher before the Presidential election, but were not published until after

</p>
<p>has just returned from a visit to South Carolina. He
</p>
<p>was in Columbia, S.C., and says that the people there
</p>
<p>are unanimously for Breckinridge, and are in favor of
</p>
<p>secession. His testimony can be relied on, for he is
</p>
<p>himself a Breckinridge man and an avowed disunionist. But, reader, before this article goes to press, the
</p>
<p>destiny of our nation will be sealed.
</p>
<p>"We still hope that, in the providence of God, Lincoln will not be elected. But, in the event that he is,
</p>
<p>we would candidly advise our readers to act with
</p>
<p>the profoundest deliberation and the greatest prudence.
</p>
<p>The present and future happiness of us all is involved
</p>
<p>in this matter. Don't act rashly. Theory and practice are widely different. To talk of war and fighting
</p>
<p>is one thing; actual war and hard fighting is quito
</p>
<p>another thing. If possible, let us ward off the evil;
</p>
<p>but if nothing else will do, and war must come, then
</p>
<p>let every one prepare for the very worst."
</p>
<p>We learned during our visit to North Carolina that,
</p>
<p>while the South Carolinians were for Breckinridge and
</p>
<p>in favor of secession, they actually wanted Lincoln to
</p>
<p>be elected. This may appear strange to one who does
</p>
<p>not understand the "infernal", plot of treason laid by
</p>
<p>these arch-traitors to destroy the Republic. The leaders of this treasonable plot wanted some pretext to
</p>
<p>justify them in their worse than hellish work in the
</p>
<p>eyes of the people and of the world. They wanted
</p>
<p>something to thoroughly "fire up the Southern heart,"
</p>
<p>and to prepare the masses of the people in the slave
</p>
<p>States to fall into their "infernal" plot to destroy
</p>
<p>the Republic and effectually and forever break. up

</p>
<p>the Government. The election of Mr. Lincoln they
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>supposed would do this. The Breckinridge electors
</p>
<p>throughout the South had been careful to prepare
</p>
<p>the minds and hearts of that party, by teaching them
</p>
<p>what to do and how to act in the event of "certain
</p>
<p>contingencies;" that is to say, "if Abe Lincoln is
</p>
<p>elected, we, the Breckinridge party, will secede from
</p>
<p>the Union, and will drag all the slave States along
</p>
<p>with us." "We will rule if we can, but ruin if we
</p>
<p>cannot."
</p>
<p>That the whole plot was preconceived and predeterrmined by the leaders needs no stronger evidence
</p>
<p>than the simultaneous action of the whole party,
</p>
<p>turning, as they did, right over to the damnable doctrine of secession immediately after the election of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln.
</p>
<p>In less than one month from the day of the Presidential election, the contemptible "secesh" flag was
</p>
<p>floating from the top of a tall pole in the town of
</p>
<p>Goldsboro', North Carolina. We saw it there early in
</p>
<p>the month of December, 1860, even before South Carolina had seceded. This we were told by a citizen was
</p>
<p>the work of the Breckinridge party. Our heart
</p>
<p>pained us as we gazed upon what we then considered
</p>
<p>and remarked at the time to our friend to be the
</p>
<p>abomination of the desolation of our own native,
</p>
<p>dearly-beloved South.
</p>
<p>In returning to Fredericksburg early in the month
</p>
<p>of December, 1860, from North Carolina, we learned
</p>
<p>in Richmond that the doctrine of secession was becoming popular, and men everywhere were avowing
</p>

<p>us the question of secession, and, Breckinridge lawyerlike, warmly and most enthusiastically argued to convince us of the correctness of his disunion sentiments.
</p>
<p>We reasoned the subject with him, and, finally, in a
</p>
<p>summary manner, summed up a few of the many horrible results of his principles, if carried into effect, at
</p>
<p>all of which he seemed to be perfectly astonished. We
</p>
<p>closed our remarks to him in the presence of others
</p>
<p>by simply remarking, " Time will prove who is correct
</p>
<p>on this subject." Subsequent facts speak for themselves. Come and see.
</p>
<p>On our arrival in Fredericksburg we were utterly
</p>
<p>surprised to learn that the subject of uncompromising,
</p>
<p>unconditional secession was advocated by many, mostly,
</p>
<p>however, by men of the Breckinridge party. One of
</p>
<p>our citizens had gone so far as to put a star on his hat,
</p>
<p>determined that all who saw him might know him to
</p>
<p>be a disunionist,-a rampant, hot-headed, brainless
</p>
<p>South Carolina secessionist. We began to tremble for
</p>
<p>the fate not only of the Gulf States, but also for good
</p>
<p>old Virginia. We say uncompromising, unconditional
</p>
<p>secession, because the leaders of the secession party
</p>
<p>had determined to accept of no compromise whatever.
</p>
<p>They were unconditional secessionists,-disunionists for

<p>TIE "BANNER'S" FIDELITY TO THE SOUTH AND THE

<p>UNION-IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THE UNION, ETC.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of November 29, 1860, under the head of "Random
</p>
<p>Thoughts Shot at a Venture," we wrote and published
</p>
<p>the following:"Dear reader, this number closes the twelfth volume
</p>
<p>of the:' Christian Banner.' While we reflect on the
</p>
<p>ups and downs, the trials and afflictions, the crosses
</p>
<p>and losses, the incidents and accidents, the sorrows and
</p>
<p>troubles, the privations and pleasures, of the last
</p>
<p>twelve years of our eventful life, the emotions of our
</p>
<p>heart are indescribable. We can't crush back the
</p>
<p>rising tear of mournful sadness. Our feelings are inexpressible,-known to none but God, our heavenly
</p>
<p>Father. The waters of affliction run deep, and roll
</p>
<p>heavily over our troubled breast. We trust in God's
</p>
<p>promises.
</p>
<p>"Dear reader, permit us to say in this chapter of'Random Thoughts' that, in our editorial of the first
</p>
<p>number of the'Christian Banner,' which was published the 4th of December, A.D. 1848, we distinctly
</p>
<p>and most emphatically stated that we were with the

<p>connected. Come weal or woe, peace or war, famine
</p>
<p>or plenty, victory or death, it shall be our pride and
</p>
<p>boast while living, and our honor and glory when
</p>
<p>dying, to yield up to God the blessed, Southern, vital
</p>
<p>air which we first breathed when we came into this
</p>
<p>grand, glorious, and sublime world.
</p>
<p>"We love the South, and we can't help it, and we
</p>
<p>don't want to help it, and we shall not try to help it.
</p>
<p>The farther we get into the South, the more and more
</p>
<p>we feel like staying in the South. We were born and
</p>
<p>cradled in the South, we were educated in the South,
</p>
<p>embraced Christianity in the South, were ordained to
</p>
<p>preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in the South, mar-.ried in the South, settled in the South, have lived all
</p>
<p>our life in the South, and intend to die in the South.
</p>
<p>"The companion of our early manhood, the idol of our
</p>
<p>heart, three of our children, our parents and ancestors,
</p>
<p>are buried and sleeping beneath the sacred soil of the
</p>
<p>South. If we must fight, and nothing will do but fight,
</p>
<p>let us fight where our noble ancestors fought, and bled,
</p>
<p>and died,-so that, when the fight is over, should we
</p>
<p>fall on the battle-field, and have no friends left to lay
</p>
<p>us low in the ground by the side of our ancestors, companion, children, and relatives,-we may at least be
</p>
<p>blessed and honored with the divine privilege to lie
</p>
<p>and repose on the surface of Southern soil over their

<p>sacred graves.

<p>never! Our prayer to God is, that, when we wake up
</p>
<p>in the general judgment, we may appear there a white
</p>
<p>man, an honest man, a gentleman, and a Christian.
</p>
<p>This Black Republicans do not believe can be possible,
</p>
<p>for they'do not fellowship slave-holders or their apologists as Christians.' We hope that in eternity our
</p>
<p>individuality will be retained, and that we shall be our
</p>
<p>identical self, and nothing more nor less.
</p>
<p>"Reader, you begin to think, perhaps, that we have
</p>
<p>turned disunionist, secessionist; but we have not. We
</p>
<p>are decidedly, constantly, and wholly opposed to a dissolution of the Union, if it can by any possible, honorable means be avoided.
</p>
<p>"' But how can we defend the South by staying in the
</p>
<p>Union?' Ay, that's the question, the problem to be
</p>
<p>solved! How, we answer, can we the better defend the
</p>
<p>South by going out of the Union?
</p>
<p>" We will fight for the South, but we will fight for her
</p>
<p>in the Union; then, if we gain the victory, we shall
</p>
<p>have preserved both the South and the Union, for the
</p>
<p>South can only be saved by remaining in the Union;
</p>
<p>then, if we gain the victory, we shall retain a prize
</p>
<p>worthy the battle, however long, hard, and bloody that
</p>
<p>battle may be.
</p>
<p>"If we go out of the Union, whom shall we fight? Black
</p>
<p>Republicans? They are the only ones of whom fears
</p>
<p>seem to be entertained. What! voluntarily surrender
</p>
<p>the Union, the boon of our ancestors, which cost them
</p>
<p>their fortunes, their blood and lives, into the hands of
</p>
<p>our sworn enemies, and then wage war upon them and

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>"Let us stay in'the Union, and fight for our rights in
</p>
<p>the Union, and, if we cannot get our rights by fighting
</p>
<p>Black Republicans in the Uni.on, let us drive them out
</p>
<p>of the Union, and have things our own way, and the
</p>
<p>right and constitutional way.
</p>
<p>"Do we not virtually acknowledge our inability to
</p>
<p>contend against the Black Republicans by going voluntarily out of the Union and giving up all into their
</p>
<p>hands? If we are not able to contend with them in
</p>
<p>the Union, how shall we be able to do it out of the
</p>
<p>Union? If they can whip us while we are in the Union,
</p>
<p>they can whip us after we get out of the Union; so that
</p>
<p>we shall be no safer out of the Union than we are in
</p>
<p>the Union.
</p>
<p>"Again, while we remain in the Union we shall have
</p>
<p>the aid and influence of all conservative, constitutional,
</p>
<p>and law-abiding citizens at the North on our side; but
</p>
<p>if we go out of the Union, byforce of circumstances they
</p>
<p>will be compelled to yield to the Black Republicans,
</p>
<p>and must, consequently, finally become enemies, or at
</p>
<p>least inefficient friends, to the South. So that, by going
</p>
<p>out of the Union, it seems to us that the South has
</p>
<p>every thing to lose and nothing to gain: hence, in advocating the perpetuity of the Union, we feel that we
</p>
<p>are advocating the peace, prosperity, and future glory
</p>
<p>of the South.
</p>
<p>" We were opposed to any sectional man being brought
</p>
<p>out as a candidate for the Presidency of these United
</p>
<p>States. The result is just what we fearfully anticipated.

<p>But, seeing that a sectional President is about to be

<p>Black Republican constituents should sustain him in

<p>oath, then let all constitutional and Union-loving citizens in the United States rise up in all the strength of

<p>their awful majesty and level all their united forces
</p>
<p>against him and his wicked accomplices in crime, and
</p>
<p>make a full, clean, and clear sweep of the whole party.
</p>
<p>"We heartily repudiate the summary manner of individuals, little communities, counties, and States running
</p>
<p>out of the Union by themselves before the time comes,
</p>
<p>and before the word is authoritatively and officially
</p>
<p>given, by dragging down the glorious flag of the Union
</p>
<p>and running up little'one-star' banners, to be gazed
</p>
<p>at by the prudent, the wise and patriotic citizens of

<p>should be made over the downfall of our glorious

<p>unity of the South. If the secession of any two, three,

<p>line roll off in one united body, and leave the Black

<p>be the best course to pursue to secure present and future

<p>safety to the South, and to prevent war and bloodshed.
</p>
<p>Let us be calm, cool, collected, deliberate, and determined, and when the word is officially given, and the

<p>time comes to act, if action must be taken, let the

<p>will it produce the desired effect, and in no other way,

<p>nor at any other time.

<p>deliberations of all the Southern Legislatures and Conventions, and trust that God, in his wisdom and mercy,
</p>
<p>may yet devise a remedy for the salvation of the Union.
</p>
<p>We trust our Legislators, Congressmen, Senators, and
</p>
<p>President will all act wisely and prudently. This is the
</p>
<p>time when all should invoke the aid of an all-wise, allmerciful, and all-powerful Arm to save. Every one
</p>
<p>should think and act promptly. Let there be no division in the South. If there should be, there is fearful

<p>danger that the South and the Union will both be inevitably ruined. Reader, think, will you? May God grant

<p>us wisdom to do right, and to act in conformity to his

<p>in the South, it was unnatural and impossible that we
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>could be any thing other than a Southern man with
</p>
<p>Southern principles and sympathies. From the reading
</p>
<p>of the Abolition journals of the North, we feared that
</p>
<p>their object was, under the Administration of Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, to make war on the South for the avowed purpose of abolishing African slavery in the South; and,
</p>
<p>from the character given Mr. Lincoln, during the Presidential canvass, by all the Breckinridge, Bell, and
</p>
<p>Douglas electors, we feared that when he came into
</p>
<p>power he would aid and abet the Abolitionists in carrying out their purposes and plans against the South.
</p>
<p>The only way, therefore, that we saw, by which the
</p>
<p>South could save herself, in the event of any of the States
</p>
<p>seceding, was for the whole of the slave States to unite
</p>
<p>for the purpose of repelling the threatened invasion of
</p>
<p>the Northern Abolitionists-.
</p>
<p>Subsequent developments, however, convinced us
</p>
<p>that the South was not, and never could be, a unit.
</p>
<p>The Breckinridge party-the leaders, we mean-were
</p>
<p>as bitter in their denunciations of the Union men of the
</p>
<p>South as they were against the most ultra Abolitionists
</p>
<p>of the North, and, if any tSling, more so. The degrading
</p>
<p>epithets which were constantly heaped upon the Union
</p>
<p>men of the South, by the leading Breckinridge or
</p>
<p>secession journals and orators, were only calculated,
</p>
<p>and that continually, to alienate the parties more
</p>
<p>and more. And, instead of becoming united, we saw
</p>
<p>that they never could and never would coalesce and
</p>
<p>harmonize, and that, if the rebellion were to succeed,
</p>
<p>Union men, by force of circumstances, would be crushed
</p>
<p>to earth. A man might just as well make a lumping

<p>business of it, and give a bill of sale of himself to

</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>unconditionally placed upon his neck. But we shall
</p>
<p>notice this subject more particularly in a subsequent
</p>
<p>chapter.
</p>
<p>There is one consideration that has always been a
</p>
<p>source of deep mortification to our feelings. It is this:
</p>
<p>our friends and fellow-citizens either cannot, or will not,
</p>
<p>comprehend and understand our true position. With
</p>
<p>the most of them, every man who opposes secession
</p>
<p>is an enemy to the South and a friend to the Abolitionists of the North,-when, in fact, it is exactly the
</p>
<p>contrary. Every secessionist is an actual, practical
</p>
<p>enemy to the South, and to the institutions and interests of the South, whether he knows it and believes it,
</p>
<p>or not. This requires no argument: facts which are
</p>
<p>now constantly being developed prove it true beyond
</p>
<p>any and all contradiction. Secessionists are the traitors
</p>
<p>and enemies to the South and to all her long and
</p>
<p>warmly cherished institutions, as well as traitors to
</p>
<p>their whole country and to all the free, high, and
</p>
<p>holy privileges and institutions of this great Republic,
</p>
<p>-this grand and glorious country. Because of our
</p>
<p>heart-felt devotion to the South, our own dear South,
</p>
<p>and because we loved the people of the South, we opposed secession. And because of our continued devotion to the South, we are now a refugee, homeless, and
</p>
<p>almost penniless, among strangers. But, we glory in it,
</p>
<p>we love the South, and shall until we die,-but we love

<p>confidence between all the States of the Union. There
</p>
<p>was commercial confidence between the North and
</p>
<p>South. There was confidence among our fellow-citizens

<p>generally. Produce of all kinds was bringing fine prices.

<p>Real estate was constantly advancing everywhere.
</p>
<p>Negroes commanded enormously high -prices. Within

<p>which threatens universal ruin. Already the ominous

</p>
<p>In the mean time, confidence is everywhere on the
</p>
<p>wane. Produce has fallen; negroes have depreciated
</p>
<p>in value at least thirty-three and a third per cent.;
</p>
<p>real estate has also diminished in value to an alarming
</p>
<p>extent, and still the tendency is downward.
</p>
<p>"The general commotion and the awful financial
</p>
<p>pressure are being felt by all classes throughout the
</p>
<p>whole Union. Nobody knows where to go, what to do,
</p>
<p>or how to act. Universal bankruptcy threatens our
</p>
<p>whole country. This-yes, all this-is but the fitful
</p>
<p>glimmering, the deep-toned whispering, of the lurid
</p>
<p>lightnings and awful thunders which shall soon play
</p>
<p>at our feet, and roll in terrible grandeur over our
</p>
<p>heads, while the majestic storm is raging on. Will

<p>the people submit to be engulfed in one common

<p>who are to form the Constitution of this Southern Confederacy? When prepared and presented to the people

<p>of the several States, suppose some States will not

<p>Carolina is to prepare the document, suppose that when

<p>it is presented to North Carolina she rejects one point,

<p>That which may be greatly to the interest of some

<p>States may be wholly ruinous to others. Then what?

<p>Try it over again? Why, there will have to be more

<p>concessions and compromises to complete the Constitution and permanent organization of this Southern Confederacy than now exist under the Federal Government, or the Government of these United States!

<p>Some of these Southern States will have it all their

</p>
<p>but is it certain that all the slave States can confederate and move on harmoniously together? This is a
</p>
<p>fearful experiment, yet to be made,-a dark and mysterious problem to be solved.
</p>
<p>"What a deplorable and humiliating condition, we
</p>
<p>fear, awaits our happy country in the future! Before
</p>
<p>the Federal Government is entirely and eternally
</p>
<p>broken up, we think it just and due to each and every
</p>
<p>citizen in the Southern States to have the chance of
</p>
<p>either voting themselves out of the Union or to remain
</p>
<p>in it. If we are to go out of the Union, we want to
</p>
<p>go out of our own accord, and not be thrust out against
</p>
<p>our wishes.
</p>
<p>"If the cotton States have determined to go out, this
</p>
<p>is no reason why the border States shall be forced out.
</p>
<p>And, before we consent to go out of the Union, we
</p>
<p>want to know where we can and shall go after we get
</p>
<p>out. Before we take ourself from under the protection
</p>
<p>of the Federal Government, we wish to know something about the government and laws by which we
</p>
<p>shall be governed in our new relation. This the people
</p>
<p>have the right to demand, and it is their imperative
</p>
<p>duty to demand it, before they madly and blindly rush
</p>
<p>into irretrievable ruin. This is no trifling subject.

<p>Our political and religious liberties are at stake. Our

<p>peace, our happiness, our fortunes, and that of our

<p>Shall we therefore rush on, in our madness and blindness, to universal and eternal ruin? Think, will you?

<p>and authoritatively issue a war-proclamation? Reader,
</p>
<p>for God's sake, think! Surely blindness and darkness
</p>
<p>and madness have seized the people! To destroy the
</p>
<p>purest and~ best form of government the world has
</p>
<p>ever known,-a Government formed by the clearest

<p>heads and purest hearts our country ever produced,
</p>
<p>or perhaps ever will again, and rear up a new order
</p>
<p>of things in a few days, weeks, months, or even years!
</p>
<p>How preposterous the idea! The wisest sages and
</p>
<p>purest patriots would become paralyzed at the threshold,
</p>
<p>and shrink from sacrilege so great.
</p>
<p>"Reader, we urge you to stop and think. Consider
</p>
<p>well before you unconditionally resolve to take the
</p>
<p>fearful leap into the awfully mysterious future. Once
</p>
<p>gone, all is gone! lost! lost! forever lost! Do not

</p>
<p>81'By the God of our fathers, this we will do. The
</p>
<p>country shall be saved.' Think, reader, think! And
</p>
<p>may God order your thoughts in the right direction."
</p>
<p>While Abolitionism was culminating in the North,
</p>
<p>Secessionism was culminating in the South, and, these
</p>
<p>two extremes meeting, the work of ruin is completed.
</p>
<p>And we now say that upon the souls of the leading
</p>
<p>Abolitionists of the North and the leading secessionists
</p>
<p>of the South rests the whole responsibility of all the
</p>
<p>horrors and bloodshed of this awful civil war. The
</p>
<p>Abolitionists were constantly goading and irritating the
</p>
<p>passions of the Southern people by meddling with the
</p>
<p>institutions of the South, especially that of African
</p>
<p>slavery,-an institution which they neither understood,
</p>
<p>nor in which they were in any wise interested, nor for
</p>
<p>which they were held responsible either before the
</p>
<p>tribunal of God or man, of heaven or earth,-an institution which was recognized and protected by the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>The disunionists of the South eagerly seized upon the
</p>
<p>meddling and intermeddling of Abolitionists as a fit
</p>
<p>and justifiable excuse and cause for dissolving the
</p>
<p>Union. Every little aggression of Abolitionists was
</p>
<p>magnified into a mountain, while the strongest appeals
</p>
<p>were made to the passions of the people to "fire up their
</p>
<p>hearts," and to prepare and fit them for the perpetrating
</p>
<p>of the most unchristian acts upon strangers travelling
</p>
<p>through the South and upon citizens who had emigrated to the South from the North. Hence almost
</p>
<p>every man who was not a blatant disunionist was eyed
</p>
<p>with suspicion: some were fined and imprisoned, others

<p>and feathered and ridden on fence-rails,-while others,
</p>
<p>again, were actually hung; and in one case a man was
</p>
<p>fastened up in a hogshead and rolled down a deep precipice into the Mississippi River. In a word, it had
</p>
<p>become both difficult and dangerous for strangers to
</p>
<p>travel through the South unless they had recommendations from the very highest authorities of slave-holding
</p>
<p>States. Spiritualism had already by law been suppressed in some of the Southern States; and all teachers,
</p>
<p>male and female, from the North, were becoming more
</p>
<p>and more suspected, and many of them had been discharged and ordered to leave the South,-all which
</p>
<p>was calculated to irritate and stir up the worst passions
</p>
<p>of the people of the North.
</p>
<p>The leading editors and orators of the Abolitionists
</p>
<p>of the North, and the leading editors and orators of the
</p>
<p>secession, disunion "fire-eaters" of the South, seemed to
</p>
<p>vie with each other as to who should be the most successful in effectually and speedily breaking up the Federal
</p>
<p>Government. Hence we repeat that all the horrors
</p>
<p>of this horrible civil war rest on their guilty souls;
</p>
<p>and they will have to atone for their abominable blackhearted wickedness through all time and eternity, and
</p>
<p>to the people of these United States, and to God, the
</p>
<p>Judge of all. This may be considered by the very
</p>
<p>sanctimonious religionists, Abolitionists, and Secessionists, as rather severe language to be applied to mockyhilanthropists and traitors, or to Abolitionists and

<p>Secessionists; but if, according to the teachings of the

</p>
<p>nothing to retract in the opinion advanced above.
</p>
<p>In the number of the "Christian Banner" of December 13, 1860, we wrote the following:"In this hour of our country's gloom and deep distress, where is the peace conservative spirit of the Christian Churches? Ay, reader! there has been a deep,
</p>
<p>dark, successful, ecclesiastical under-current at work,
</p>
<p>of which the great body of the people have remained
</p>
<p>in darkness.
</p>
<p>"The ecclesiastical parties that have agitated the
</p>
<p>institution which has brought our country to the present fearful crisis should feel responsibilities resting on
</p>
<p>their sinful souls, weighty and lasting as eternity.
</p>
<p>Beware of them; for within the folds of the white robes
</p>
<p>of the Church lie hid the keys of empire and an iron
</p>
<p>sceptre.
</p>
<p>" Why do not the ministers and religious editors who
</p>
<p>have worked long and hard to bring about the ruin of
</p>
<p>our country now hold ecclesiastical conventions, and
</p>
<p>resolve to act as peace-makers between the antagonistic

<p>parties? Why fold their arms, close their eyes, and

<p>at our very doors? Because the work of ruin and

<p>death is going on too finely to be obstructed now!

<p>fool the people into the belief that God will listen to
</p>
<p>their folly! Know, reader, that, if our country is saved,

<p>future bliss, and for the hope of immortality and eternal

<p>life offers the boon of eternal annihilation!

<p>of an awful chasm, deep, dark, and terrible! Let us

<p>think before we take the fatal leap!"
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that, for many years past,

<p>there have been a number of professed gospel ministers

<p>at the South who have toiled with as much untiring

</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of December
</p>
<p>20, 1860, under the head of " Random Thoughts Shot
</p>
<p>at a Venture," we wrote the following,-which was the
</p>
<p>last article we wrote during the year 1860. At the
</p>
<p>time we wrote it, we had not learned of the passage of
</p>
<p>an ordinance of secession by the Convention of South
</p>
<p>Carolina.
</p>
<p>"Thank God, reader, this is the last chapter of'Random Thoughts' which we shall write in the evermemorable and eventful year of our Lord one thousand
</p>
<p>eight hundred and sixty. This will ever be memorable in the history of America as a year of resolutions,
</p>
<p>legislatures, conventions, resignations, secessions, and
</p>
<p>of the breaking up and the downfall and utter ruin of
</p>
<p>this great American Republic.
</p>
<p>"The seeds of national ruin are sown, and the germ
</p>
<p>lives, grows, and thrives. The leaven of discord is
</p>
<p>doing its mighty work with unparalleled swiftness and
</p>
<p>accuracy. We have acted the part of a faithful sentinel ever since we assumed the high responsibilities of
</p>
<p>the editorial chair. Some have mocked, others have
</p>
<p>become offended, while others, again, have professed

<p>to admire the bold, fearless, and independent course of
</p>

</p>
<p>the'Banner.' Fools may mock and laugh at the voice
</p>
<p>of wisdom now; but at the last they will weep over
</p>
<p>their own folly, and cry for mercy when it will be too
</p>
<p>late forever.
</p>
<p>" Wehave from time to time expressed our views relative to the present crisis of our common country. We
</p>
<p>could write volumes, if it would do any good or save
</p>
<p>our country. We fear, however, that the die is cast,
</p>
<p>and can only now warn our fellow-citizens to prepare
</p>
<p>for one of the most awful and terribly-sublime revolutions to be found in the world's history,-the result of all which, we fear, will be a military despotism. Let us not close our eyes to the fearful dangers
</p>
<p>which surround us on every side. Let us be watchful,
</p>
<p>prayerful, looking unto, and constantly trusting in, the
</p>
<p>mercy and goodness of God to save us and our country
</p>
<p>from onie common ruin.
</p>
<p>"To our female readers of the'Banner' we would
</p>
<p>say, Be calm. Be not unnecessarily alarmed. The
</p>
<p>God who has always protected his people can protect
</p>
<p>them still. Look to the Bible, the cross, and up to the
</p>
<p>throne of your Father in heaven. Remember, a sparrow falls not to the ground without his notice, and that
</p>
<p>even the hairs of our head are all numbered. The reins
</p>
<p>of universal empire are in his almighty hand, and the
</p>
<p>rise and downfall of kingdoms, empires, and republics
</p>
<p>are all at his command.
</p>
<p>"Nations, as well as individuals, have repented and
</p>
<p>obtained forgiveness from him. As a people, we have
</p>
<p>grown great and proud; and, although nominally
</p>
<p>Christians, we have been unmindful of God our creator,
</p>
<p>and neglectful of our duties. If, therefore, our kind

<p>heavenly Father is about to lay on us the chastening

</p>
<p>rod, let us neither murmur nor repine. It may all be
</p>
<p>for our eternal good. Remember, also, that you will
</p>
<p>be constantly watched and cared for by every brave
</p>
<p>son of this declining Republic. Be strong, therefore,
</p>
<p>and fear not.
</p>
<p>" Never have we felt more cool, calm, collected, and
</p>
<p>determined. We have passed through many storms
</p>
<p>of infinitely more importance to ourself, individually,
</p>
<p>than a great national revolution can be, so far as the
</p>
<p>dangers of simply passing through a revolution are
</p>
<p>concerned. The after-consequences are more to be
</p>
<p>dreaded than the revolution itself. To die is a small
</p>
<p>matter, provided the work of death be quickly executed;
</p>
<p>but the idea of becoming the vassal of a petty despot
</p>
<p>is intolerable.
</p>
<p>"Remember what we say:-If this Republic be
</p>
<p>broken up, in process of time, we doubt not, every
</p>
<p>State in the Union will become a separate, independent sovereignty, with a contemptible despot at
</p>
<p>its head, and that church and state will coalesce. In
</p>
<p>each little monarchy the religious par.ty that is most
</p>
<p>popular, wealthy, and influential will be protected and
</p>
<p>supported by Government, to the neglect of all others.
</p>
<p>Reader, youmay laugh now; but you, your children,
</p>
<p>and your grandchildren may weep and lament when
</p>
<p>too late.
</p>
<p>"Some even yet talk of a peaceable dissolution of
</p>
<p>the Union. What wild and strange infatuation! Do
</p>
<p>South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, North
</p>
<p>Carolina, and Virginia think there will be a peaceable
</p>
<p>dissolution? Why, then, are they arming themselves
</p>
<p>and making such heavy outlays in preparing for war?

<p>What mean these'Minute-Men' at the South and
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>89'Wide-Awakes' at the North, if there be no danger
</p>
<p>of war?'Tis folly, absurd, downright madness, to
</p>
<p>think of revolution without war. The thing is impossible.
</p>
<p>"We think it is an outrage for the Union to be
</p>
<p>broken up by extreme sectionalists. Let the South
</p>
<p>and the conservative men at the North resolve that the
</p>
<p>Union shall not be destroyed. Annihilate the champion Abolition leaders at the North and the leading
</p>
<p>secession traitors at the South, first. If they cannot
</p>
<p>be conquered in the Union and by the Union, how in
</p>
<p>the name of Heaven can they be after the whole South
</p>
<p>goes out of the Union? Let us have our rights, and
</p>
<p>have them where we ought to have them, in the
</p>
<p>Union, not out of the Union. Let us never be driven
</p>
<p>out of the'big house into the kitchen,' or (should we
</p>
<p>not rather say?) out-of-doors into the wide world, when
</p>
<p>all our rights are in the'big house,'-and that, too, by
</p>
<p>a set of fanatical Black Republicans and secession
</p>
<p>demagogues! Think of that, will you?
</p>
<p>"We are for the preservation of the Union, though
</p>
<p>American soil should be steeped in the blood of her
</p>
<p>brave, warm-hearted, patriotic sons. This will be the
</p>
<p>result if we go out of the Union. Therefore, before
</p>
<p>we would voluntarily surrender up the Federal Government to Black Republicans, and go out of the Union,
</p>
<p>we would fight them and secession leaders, the archtraitors in this rebellion, until the judgment of the
</p>
<p>great day, and run all risks of servile insurrections. We
</p>
<p>would either conquer them, or they should conquer us.
</p>
<p>Never, for God's sake, for honor's sake, for our country's sake, for our children's sake, for humanity's sake,

</p>
<p>cowardly and dastardly part of acknowledging ourselves whipped before we fight, and surrendering all to
</p>
<p>our enemies before we make an effort to save all.
</p>
<p>Caesar did not act in this way, nor did our forefathers,
</p>
<p>nor will we. Never surrender. Cling on to the

<p>Union. Cleave to the'Stars and Stripes,' come weal or

<p>woe, victory or death. This is the way in which brave,

<p>your rights, fellow-citizens; and nothing less than this

<p>Federal Government, this blessed Union, are our

<p>rights."
</p>
<p>In the same number of the "Christian Banner" we
</p>
<p>wrote the following brief paragraph:"The South Carolina Secession Convention organized
</p>
<p>in Columbia on the 17th inst., and were driven by a
</p>
<p>small-pox panic to Charleston, where they arrived on
</p>
<p>the 18th instant. They had not entirely passed the
</p>
<p>Secession Ordinance when last heard from. But, in
</p>
<p>all probability, they will be out of the Union before
</p>
<p>this paragraph meets the reader's eye; rather a bad
</p>
<p>start."
</p>
<p>Before our paper went to press, we received the following news from Charleston, which we published in
</p>
<p>the same number of the " Banner:""The Union dissolved! Late and important from
</p>
<p>South Carolina! Fourth day's proceedings. Secession

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>with prayer to-day, after which the roll was called and
</p>
<p>the journal read.
</p>
<p>"A resolution was offered inviting the Mayor of
</p>
<p>Charleston to a seat on the floor of the Convention. It
</p>
<p>was amended by including the Governor of the State,
</p>
<p>the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the
</p>
<p>House. In this form it was passed.
</p>
<p>" The chair announced the appointment of a committee
</p>
<p>to draw up a summary of the causes for the secession
</p>
<p>of South Carolina, and also for standing committees.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Rhett offered a resolution for the appointment
</p>
<p>of a committee of thirteen for the purpose of providing
</p>
<p>for the assemblage of a convention of the seceding
</p>
<p>States, and to form a Constitution. Adopted.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Inglis made a report from the committee to prepare and draft an ordinance proper to be adopted by
</p>
<p>the Convention. The ordinance is as follows:-
</p>
<p>"'An ordinance to dissolve the union between the
</p>
<p>State of South Carolina and the other States united

<p>with her under the compact entitled "The Constitution

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>" PASSAGE OF THE ORDINANCE.
</p>
<p>"The ordinance was taken up and passed by a unanimous vote of 169,-all the members voting.
</p>
<p>" The passage took place at precisely a quarter-past
</p>
<p>one o'clock, P.M.
</p>
<p>"The news spreads over the city. Great cheering.
</p>
<p>"As soon as the passage of the ordinance was known
</p>
<p>outside the doors of the Convention, the tidings spread
</p>
<p>rapidly all over the city, and a great crowd collected
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of Secession Hall. Immense cheering
</p>
<p>ensued.
</p>
<p>" Mr. JMiles moved that the clerk telegraph to members of Congress at Washington that the ordinance
</p>
<p>had passed, and the motion was unanimously carried.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Dessausue offered the following:""Resolved, That the Secession Ordinance be engrossed on parchment, under the direction of the Attorney-General, and signed by the President and members, this evening, at Institute Hall, and that it be
</p>
<p>placed among the archives of the State.'
</p>
<p>"Half-past six o'clock was agreed upon as the hour
</p>
<p>to proceed to Institute Hall for the purpose of signing
</p>
<p>the document."
</p>
<p>The reader will bear in mind that "at precisely a
</p>
<p>quarter-past one o'clock, P.M., on the 20th day of
</p>
<p>December, one thousand eight hundred and sixty,
</p>
<p>South Carolina committed the suicidal act, which
</p>
<p>action influenced all the other seceding States to perpetrate the same acts of self-destruction. Notwithstanding we had long anticipated the course which
</p>
<p>South Carolina would take, yet when the intelligence

</p>
<p>was received that the ordinance of Secession was
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>actually passed, and that South Carolina, our native
</p>
<p>State, had declared herself dissolved from all connection with the United States of America, the news fell
</p>
<p>upon our ear like the deafening thunder of heaven at
</p>
<p>noonday from a clear sky. To us it sounded like the
</p>
<p>death-knell of a nation's glory. The cheering and
</p>
<p>dancing of ungrateful, wicked children over the grave of
</p>
<p>of a kind and affectionate mother would have seemed no
</p>
<p>more unnatural to us than did the great cheering of the
</p>
<p>citizens of Charleston over the downfall of their State
</p>
<p>and country. Oh, what blindness! What madness!
</p>
<p>South Carolina had suffered less from the aggressions
</p>
<p>of Northern Abolitionists than any other State, perhaps, in the Union. Her geographical position effectually secured her slaves from the aggressions of the
</p>
<p>Abolitionists of the North. But she was not satisfied.
</p>
<p>Secession and the reopening of the African slave-trade
</p>
<p>and free trade were long-cherished idols and hopes of
</p>
<p>South Carolina. Charleston was to be a London, or
</p>
<p>Liverpool, and the leaders in this rebellion were to be
</p>
<p>despots and tyrants over thousands of the suffering,
</p>
<p>benighted sons and daughters of Africa's unhappy race.
</p>
<p>We venture the assertion that Virginia alone had
</p>
<p>lost more negroes up to the time of this rebellion than
</p>
<p>all the Gulf States together; and yet Virginia was
</p>
<p>willing and anxious to remain in the Union, while the
</p>
<p>Gulf States, with scarcely the pretext of the shade of
</p>
<p>a shadow of cause for their rash act, thrust themselves
</p>
<p>out of the Union, and declared they would drag the
</p>
<p>border States with them. We have often said, and it
</p>
<p>has ever been the honest conviction of our mind and
</p>
<p>heart, that if South Carolina had been geographically

</p>
<p>located as Virginia is, she would never have seceded.
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>But Virginia was made a "cat's paw" for South Carolina and the other cotton States, and she has paid but
</p>
<p>too dearly for her credulity and imbecility. However
</p>
<p>much we detested the course pursued by Northern
</p>
<p>Abolitionists, the rash act of South Carolina in seceding
</p>
<p>from the "United States of America" was far more
</p>
<p>reprehensible than any thing the Abolitionists had ever
</p>
<p>done.
</p>
<p>It may be well to remark here, for the satisfaction of
</p>
<p>the reader, that the impression was made upon the
</p>
<p>minds of the people of the South that the fixed purpose of the Black Republican party, of which Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln was represented as being the head, was to
</p>
<p>make war upon the South, for the purpose of abolishing slavery, and that they intended to stir up the
</p>
<p>negro population to servile insurrections, to murder the
</p>
<p>whites indiscriminately, and turn loose all the negroes
</p>
<p>upon the whole South to do as they pleased. In a
</p>
<p>word, that there was to be a general "John Brown
</p>
<p>raid" upon a magnificent scale, which, with all the aids
</p>
<p>and Government facilities, would secure almost certain
</p>
<p>success. Hence it was that the whole South was considered a unit to drive back any such diabolical, aggressive party. The Abolition journals of the North
</p>
<p>went very far to confirm the minds of the Southern
</p>
<p>people in this belief. But South Carolina was too fast
</p>
<p>for the Abolitionists, even if their purpose was as
</p>
<p>above suggested. The honor, the imperishable glory,
</p>
<p>of secession and inaugurating civil war was reserved
</p>
<p>for South Carolina! Shame on the State, and infamy

<p>CHAPTER XIV.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of January
</p>
<p>3, 1861, we wrote the following paragraphs: 
</p>
<p>"New Year.-We enter upon the New Year with
</p>
<p>feelings quite different from any in the past history of
</p>
<p>our eventful life. This is the last New Year's day we
</p>
<p>ever expect to be worthy of being accounted a citizen
</p>
<p>of the United States of America. We have resolved
</p>
<p>to take all things calmly and coolly, and wait the final
</p>
<p>result, whatever that result may be.
</p>
<p>"Before the next New Year our country will either
</p>
<p>be flooded with blood and carnage, or else settled down
</p>
<p>upon terms which will secure peace and harmony for
</p>
<p>generations yet to come.'Tis awful to be held in a
</p>
<p>state of everlasting suspense. If war is to come, and
</p>
<p>come it will, we care not how soon. The sooner this
</p>
<p>question is settled the better it will be for the whole
</p>
<p>country. We fear nothing, so far as we are individually concerned. All we care for is the thought that our
</p>
<p>happy country is to be broken up; that the'Stars and
</p>
<p>Stripes' of this glorious Union are to trail in the dust;
</p>
<p>that so many lives of our fellow-citizens are to be sacrificed; that our whole country for the time being is to
</p>
<p>become bankrupt; that all our social, political, and
</p>
<p>religious blessings, for the time being at least, are to
</p>
<p>become paralyzed. When, however, the storm shall

</p>
<p>manently settled, we may bless God that we passed

<p>may forever thereafter enjoy the calm and the sunshine.

<p>"- Our readers must pardon us for writing no more
</p>
<p>editorials. Our opinions now are not what the excited
</p>
<p>people want. They want to know what is going on.
</p>
<p>They want facts, not opinions; and these we will continue to give until the battles are all fought and the
</p>
<p>victory won.
</p>
<p>"We say to the South, for God's sake, for one another's sake, for the sake of our country, let us all at
</p>
<p>the South be a unit. As long as there was any hope
</p>
<p>of the Union, we were for it, but, now that all hope is
</p>
<p>gone, we earnestly urge the necessity that the whole
</p>
<p>South stand shoulder to shoulder; come weal: or
</p>
<p>woe, let us all live or die together. We confidently
</p>
<p>say to all our readers that they need not be surprised
</p>
<p>at any moment to hear that war has commenced. We
</p>
<p>read the papers from all sections of the country, and
</p>
<p>have a fair opportunity of forming tolerably correct
</p>
<p>opinions upon the future result of affairs.
</p>
<p>" In the event of civil war, the North has decidedly
</p>
<p>the advantage over the South. The Northern people
</p>
<p>have war-implements, and all necessary facilities for
</p>
<p>manufacturing them. They outnumber the people of
</p>
<p>the South by thousands and millions. When they
</p>
<p>leave their families and property to march to the
</p>
<p>battle-field, they leave all safe behind them. They
</p>
<p>have provisions and means to carry on and keep up a
</p>
<p>war of extermination. All these things should be well
</p>
<p>considered by the Southern people. And it should be
</p>
<p>remembered, likewise, that the Northern people are

<p>of a collision between the secessionists and the troops

<p>and defend their rights, whether they wish to do so or
</p>
<p>not. Think of that, will you?
</p>
<p>"If Virginia secedes from the Union, she will, by the
</p>
<p>force of circumstances, be a free State in less than a
</p>
<p>quarter of a century; and, as soon as she secedes, her
</p>
<p>slave property will become comparatively valueless.
</p>
<p>The actual depreciation of the value of servants in the
</p>
<p>slave States since the election of Mr. Lincoln is more
</p>
<p>than every negro in the State of South Carolina would
</p>
<p>sell for, at the enormous prices they would have
</p>
<p>brought twelve months ago. This is only one of the
</p>
<p>small blessings of blessed secession. Think of that,
</p>
<p>will you?'
</p>
<p>At the time of writing the above, there was but little
</p>
<p>to hope for. South Carolina had already seceded, and
</p>
<p>the Governor of that State had been tendered the
</p>
<p>services of troops from Georgia, Alabama, and different
</p>
<p>portions of South Carolina. A committee had been
</p>
<p>sent from Wilmington, North Carolina, to consult

</p>
<p>Fort Johnson, a Revolutionary fortress, situated on
</p>
<p>Cape Fear River, about two miles from its mouth, and
</p>
<p>near the town of Smithville. Governor Ellis did not
</p>
<p>advise the taking possession of the fort, but the committee returned home resolved upon taking care of the
</p>
<p>entire Cape Fear section,-which clearly and fully demonstrated the fact that Governor Ellis would not
</p>
<p>oppose the action of the committee, thus tacitly consenting to the capturing of the fort.
</p>
<p>The Cabinet of the Congress of the United States at
</p>
<p>Washington was divided, and in a state of the most
</p>
<p>deplorable and ridiculous disorder and confusion, in
</p>
<p>relation to the course to be pursued in reference
</p>
<p>to Major Anderson,-the commissioners from South
</p>
<p>Carolina peremptorily demanding that he should be
</p>
<p>ordered back to Fort Moultrie. Messrs. Floyd, Thomas,
</p>
<p>and Thompson were in favor of his being ordered
</p>
<p>back, while Messrs. Holt, Black, and Stanton opposed
</p>
<p>it. Toucey and the President were non-committal.
</p>
<p>The commissioners from South Carolina affirmed that
</p>
<p>unless Major Anderson was dealt with according to
</p>
<p>their demands, they should consider a non-compliance on the part of the Administration an act of
</p>
<p>coercion, which the State of South Carolina would not
</p>
<p>tolerate. Senator Wigfall, of Texas, and Senator
</p>
<p>Davis, of Mississippi, urged President Buchanan to
</p>
<p>send Anderson back to Fort Moultrie immediately, as
</p>
<p>the only way of preventing a collision between the
</p>
<p>United States troops and those of South Carolina.
</p>
<p>It was stated that Buchanan determined to shirk the
</p>
<p>responsibility of ordering Major Anderson back, and
</p>
<p>throw it on some one else.

<p>At this time, also, great war-preparations were being
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>made at the North. It was said that Massachusetts
</p>
<p>was ready to respond promptly to any demand made
</p>
<p>upon her for troops to sustain the Union and the
</p>
<p>laws; that seven thousand troops could be put in
</p>
<p>marching order at twenty-four hours' notice; that one
</p>
<p>hundred and forty-five thousand were enrolled in the
</p>
<p>militia of the State, and of that number twenty thousand could be easily mustered. If the reader is at all
</p>
<p>acquainted with the history of the proceedings of our
</p>
<p>country from the meeting of Congress in 1860 up to
</p>
<p>the time that it adjourned in 1861, he will not be at
</p>
<p>all surprised that men should have despaired of all
</p>
<p>hope of any amicable settlement of our national difficulties. South Carolina in arms at the one extreme,
</p>
<p>and Massachusetts in arms at the other extreme, what
</p>
<p>were men in the border States to expect, but to be
</p>
<p>overwhelmed, annihilated, in the common ruin?
</p>
<p>We saw no possible chance of avoiding collision between
</p>
<p>the United States troops and those of South Carolina,
</p>
<p>unless Virginia could step in between the two belligerent parties as a pacificator, and devise some compromise by which to reconcile them. Of this, however,
</p>
<p>we had but little hope, owing to the fact that all the
</p>
<p>secession journals and orators of Virginia were moving
</p>
<p>heaven and earth, as it were, to force secession upon
</p>
<p>the people of Virginia. Already had the secession
</p>
<p>party begun openly and boldly, and, we may add, impudently and insolently, to upbraid Union men, making
</p>
<p>all sorts of insinuations and applying all kinds of epithets to them, such as "Union-shriekers," "submissionists to old Abe Lincoln," "Black Republicans,"
</p>
<p>"Abolitionists," "Traitors to Virginia and the South."

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>103
</p>
<p>the Rev. T. R. English, who prayed to God, saying,'If, in thine inscrutable providence, we should be
</p>
<p>called upon to encounter the perils of war, may our
</p>
<p>arms, in the day of battle, be under thy shield and
</p>
<p>protection. Mray our wives, our daughters and sisters,

<p>freely give up their husbands, brothers, and sons, and
</p>
<p>in the day of battle may they encourage them to stand
</p>
<p>firmly in their places in the assertion and vindication
</p>
<p>of their rights.'
</p>
<p>" The conflicting parties, if it were possible, would
</p>
<p>place the All-Wise Ruler of the Universe in as awkward a predicament as they have got the President of
</p>
<p>the United States. If he answer the prayers of the
</p>
<p>secessionists, he must disregard and offend the people
</p>
<p>oi the North; and if he regard the prayers of the
</p>
<p>Northern people, he will offend the secessionists. So,
</p>
<p>what is he to do? He will certainly make no compromise with sin nor sinners, but will do right. Therefore, he cannot consistently answer the prayers of both
</p>
<p>parties. Nor do we intend any irreverence in this
</p>
<p>remark."
</p>
<p>It will be recollected that about this time the Representatives in the Congress of the United States from
</p>
<p>the Gulf States manifested the most morbid indifference
</p>
<p>as to what was being done in Congress, some of them
</p>
<p>declaring that they felt no interest there, as their

<p>"The Alabama and Mississippi delegations held a
</p>
<p>caucus last night, and. afterwards telegraphed to the
</p>
<p>conventions of their respective States, advising them
</p>
<p>to secede immediately, saying that there is no prospect
</p>
<p>of any satisfactory adjustment of difficulties. They
</p>
<p>resolved to remain here, however, and await the action
</p>
<p>of.their States."
</p>
<p>These Representatives were sent by the citizens of
</p>
<p>their respective States to transact the business of the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, and to guard the interests of the
</p>
<p>whole country, as well as the special interests of the
</p>
<p>people of the States which they represented. They were
</p>
<p>sworn to observe the Constitution of the United States,
</p>
<p>and were receiving pay from the Government for every
</p>
<p>hour they held their seats in Congress. In palpable violation of their solemn oaths, in violation of the high
</p>
<p>and responsible obligations they were under to their
</p>
<p>constituents and to the whole country, instead of
</p>
<p>discharging their duties as statesmen and patriots,

<p>they were constantly engaged in holding caucus-meetings and plotting treason against the Republic, while
</p>
<p>the troops at home were taking the arsenals and forts

</p>
<p>What constitutional right had the State authorities
</p>
<p>of Alabama, or any other State, to seize and take violent possession of the "United States arsenals and
</p>
<p>forts," or any other property belonging to the United
</p>
<p>States? Was this not a most wicked usurpation of
</p>
<p>power, and that, too, while these very States were
</p>
<p>represented in the Congress of the United States?
</p>
<p>The resolution declaring the right and duty of Florida
</p>
<p>to secede passed the Convention on the 7th of January,
</p>
<p>1861, by a vote of sixty-two ayes to four nays. A
</p>
<p>committee of thirteen was appointed on secession, and
</p>
<p>their ordinance for secession was adopted; and at
</p>
<p>this very time the Representatives from Florida occupied their seats in the Congress of the United States.
</p>
<p>Determined, as they were, prior to the meeting of
</p>
<p>Congress, to secede, why did they take their seats at
</p>
<p>all? Only the better to enable them to carry out their
</p>
<p>diabolical plot of breaking up the Federal Government.
</p>
<p>They had determined to accept of no compromise, however satisfactory to the border States that compromise
</p>
<p>might be.

<p>President Buchanan, why cannot ten secede in opposition to the will and wishes of Mr. Lincoln? He cannot prevent them from seceding after he comes into

<p>seceding before he came into power. So that there is

</p>
<p>While matters were thus progressing at the South,
</p>
<p>the conservative men at the North were holding meetings, and passing series of resolutions, in reference to the
</p>
<p>course which should be pursued towards the seceding
</p>
<p>States of the South. As a specimen of some of these
</p>
<p>resolutions, we give the following, adopted at a large
</p>
<p>and enthusiastic meeting held in the city of New York
</p>
<p>by the working-men of that city:"Resolved, That we regard the present movement of
</p>
<p>several of the Southern States, in resuming the powers
</p>
<p>they delegated to the General Government, as an effort
</p>
<p>to preserve our Constitution from being overthrown
</p>
<p>by Abraham Lincoln, as his party-platform requires
</p>
<p>and demands him to do.
</p>
<p>"-Resolved, That we are for the Union, the Union of
</p>
<p>our fathers; for the Constitution,-the glorious charter
</p>
<p>of our liberties,-as expounded by the recognized authority, upon the basis of equal justice, liberty, and

<p>"Resolved, That, believing that the people of the

<p>Southern States are, and have ever been, content to
</p>
<p>remain in this Union under the Constitution as originally designed, we deeply sympathize with them in
</p>
<p>their unwilling resistance to an incoming Administration, which, by a perverted and unauthorized construction of the Constitution, tends to destroy their peace,
</p>
<p>welfare, and happiness.

<p>that will has been authoritatively declared by the Supreme Court to be in opposition to the true construction
</p>
<p>of the Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That we will, by all proper and legitimate
</p>
<p>means, oppose, discountenance, and prevent the Republican party from making any aggressive attempt, under
</p>
<p>the plea of'enforcing the laws' and'preserving the
</p>
<p>Union,' upon the rights of the Southern States, believing, as we do, that any such attempt can only result
</p>
<p>in a protracted and destructive civil war, to attain an

<p>a quarter of a century in endeavoring to equalize the

</p>
<p>only the Union, but destroy the glorious free institutions which, seventy-six years ago, our fathers extorted
</p>
<p>from an unwilling despot; and, if any additional evidence be needed to show the alliance of the so-called

<p>consequences, it can be found in the fact that its recognized leaders' in Congress have deliberately rejected

</p>
<p>the event that the "incoming Administration" should

<p>attempt to "enforce the laws" under the pretence of

<p>preserving the Constitution and saving the Union.

</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>the secessionists of the South were equally ignorant of
</p>
<p>the spirit and determination of the conservative men
</p>
<p>of the North. We presume that the conservative men
</p>
<p>at the North had never anticipated an attack on the
</p>
<p>flag of the Union by secessionists.
</p>
<p>The secessionists had determined to accept of no
</p>
<p>compromise which might be offered. This they declared in the outset. Hence, with the leaders of the
</p>
<p>secession party, any and all compromise was a foregone conclusion. The conservative men at the North
</p>
<p>thought, or affected to think, that these leaders actually
</p>
<p>wanted a compromise, the Constitution respected, and
</p>
<p>the Union saved; whereas they had determined on immediate, complete, and eternal separation from the
</p>
<p>"old Union." Presuming, in part, at least, on the aid
</p>
<p>and assistance of the conservative men of the North,
</p>
<p>and the aid and assistance of "fifty thousand Knights of
</p>
<p>the Golden Circle," said to have been organized in the
</p>
<p>free States, they struck the fatal blow. Terrible was
</p>
<p>the disappointment,- but just what every sensible man,
</p>
<p>under the circumstances, might have expected.
</p>
<p>We believe that the conservative men at the North
</p>
<p>were honest and sincere in their assertions of friendship for and sympathy with the South. And, had the
</p>
<p>Southern States remained in the Union, and observed
</p>
<p>on their part the Constitution inviolate, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln had waged an aggressive war upon the South,
</p>
<p>for the ostensible purpose of liberating the slaves of the
</p>
<p>South, we honestly believe that hundreds of thousands
</p>
<p>of men in the free States would have risen up as one
</p>
<p>man and united with the South and annihilated the
</p>
<p>Black Republican party. But when the Southern

</p>
<p>seeing that the secessionists were the aggressors,
</p>
<p>the inaugurators of civil war, they, by force of circumstances, if not from principle and patriotism, became
</p>
<p>united, and resolved to protect and defend the timehonored flag of their country, preserve the Constitution, and, if possible, save the Union.
</p>
<p>The intelligent reader cannot fail to observe, likewise, that the expressed and published opinions of the
</p>
<p>conservative men of the North in relation to the fixed
</p>
<p>purpose of the Black Republican party in waging war
</p>
<p>upon the South in order to free the negroes were well
</p>
<p>calculated to rouse the suspicions and indignation of
</p>
<p>the Southern people.
</p>
<p>That the leaders of the Black Republican party,
</p>
<p>proper, wanted the Union dissolved, to the end that
</p>
<p>they might more speedily and effectually accomplish
</p>
<p>their unholy purpose in abolishing slavery in the South,
</p>
<p>they did not pretend to conceal. Knowing the terrible results that would necessarily follow in the event
</p>
<p>of breaking up the Government, we opposed it until
</p>
<p>we rendered ourself odious with the secession party,
</p>
<p>and wellnigh lost all our patronage before we discontinued the publication of the "Banner."

<p>CHAPTER XVII.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of the
</p>
<p>31st of January, 1861, under the head of "Random
</p>
<p>Thoughts Shot at a Venture," we wrote and published
</p>
<p>the following six short chapters, which have since the
</p>
<p>war began been denominated the "Predictions of the
</p>
<p>Christian Banner,'" how justly we leave the reader
</p>
<p>to decide:"CHAP. I.-Read, Think, D)etermine, and Act!- Our

<p>soul is disgusted, our heart sickened, at the school-boy

<p>"CHAP. II.-It is argued that secession is constitutionally right. Grant it. But is it expedient? That
</p>
<p>is the question. Many things may be lawful which are
</p>
<p>by no means expedient. Secession or revolution, under
</p>
<p>certain circumstances, would not only be constitutionally right, but absolutely necessary. Is this the case
</p>
<p>now? Has the time actually come, and do the circumstances absolutely demand the secession of any one or
</p>
<p>of all the slave States? If it be unconditionally necessary for one to secede, does the same necessity demand
</p>
<p>that all shall secede? Has the work of secession and
</p>
<p>revolution commenced and progressed in a way to
</p>
<p>prove it expedient and to commend itself to the world?
</p>
<p>"The ostensible causes of secession are: first, to

<p>save the South from further Abolition aggressions; and,
</p>
<p>secondly, to free the country from the continual agitation of the slave question. The objects sought to be
</p>
<p>gained by secession are: first, to permanently establish
</p>
<p>the institution of African slavery; secondly, to extend
</p>
<p>slave territory; and, thirdly, to reduce the price of
</p>
<p>slave labor. Will secession accomplish all this? Some

<p>seem to think so. They are woefully mistaken.

</p>
<p>their work. They do not pretend to disguise the fact.
</p>
<p>So that nothing can ever be gained by secession on this
</p>
<p>score.
</p>
<p>" Will secession save the South from further Abolition
</p>
<p>aggressions? If so, how? Secessionists say,'We
</p>
<p>will form treaties and enter into leagues with the Abolitionists after we secede, and, for the sake of our trade,
</p>
<p>they will spare our slaves.' Have they said so? Have
</p>
<p>they promised to do this? No: they have not, and
</p>
<p>they never will. Are they not bound by leagues and
</p>
<p>treaties now under the Constitution? and do they observe them? If they violate treaties and break leagues
</p>
<p>under the Constitution and while they are in the
</p>
<p>Union, what assurances have we that they will make
</p>
<p>leagues and treaties and observe them inviolate after
</p>
<p>they get out of the Union and are free from all constitutional restraints and obligations? If they perpetrate
</p>
<p>depredations in the Union and under the influence of
</p>
<p>the Constitution, they will do it much more abundantly
</p>
<p>after the Federal Government is broken up. They will
</p>
<p>never enter into any treaties nor form any leagues
</p>
<p>with the South, on which the continuance and perpetuity of African slavery are contemplated. This is a
</p>
<p>fixed fact.

<p>"Dissolve the Union, break up the Federal Government, and will not the same proximity still exist between the slave and free States that exists now?

</p>
<p>the veriest menials of the lords and rulers of the people.

</p>
<p>and the work of death and desolation is done!

<p>" If the slave States conquer the free States, then the
</p>
<p>institution of African slavery may continue for the next
</p>
<p>half-century; then will slave labor be reduced to an
</p>
<p>insignificant price; then may slave territory be extended. But, before all this is gained, our country will
</p>
<p>be drenched in blood: most of those now living will
</p>
<p>never live to see slave territory expanded; they will
</p>
<p>never realize the glories of cheap slave-labor; they
</p>
<p>will never need it! Even should the South succeed,
</p>
<p>will the spoils be worth the fight, the crown, the sacrifice? Answer us, mothers, you who have sons and love

</p>
<p>121
</p>
<p>then African slavery, slave territory, and slave labor
</p>
<p>are all at an end. Extreme Abolitionists want the
</p>
<p>Federal Government broken up, because this, they say,
</p>
<p>will hasten the abolition of slavery. The present process is too slow for them. They want to accomplish
</p>
<p>the work at once.
</p>
<p>"CHAP. III. What can Virginia gain by secession?-Suppose it were possible for a peaceable separation of the Union to be consummated, and that a
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy of all the slave States were formed:
</p>
<p>what would Virginia gain by the operation? How can
</p>
<p>she be benefited in the least conceivable degree by uniting
</p>
<p>her destiny with a cotton or Southern Confederacy? The
</p>
<p>cotton States say they don't want to sell negroes,-they
</p>
<p>want to buy them at the lowest possible prices. Their
</p>
<p>income is from cotton and sugar produced by slave
</p>
<p>labor: therefore they want negroes to raise cotton and
</p>
<p>sugar. Hence it -is to their interest to get negroes as
</p>
<p>cheap as possible. We say'their interest,' because they
</p>
<p>are going in for their own interest in dollars and cents.
</p>
<p>This no one will deny who understands the subject.
</p>
<p>Hence the process by which the cotton and sugar States
</p>
<p>are to be built up and enriched, should they succeed, is
</p>
<p>the very process by which Virginia is to be pulled
</p>
<p>down, impoverished, and degraded.
</p>
<p>"For example, a Virginia farmer owes a cottonplanter ten thousand dollars, and has no means by
</p>
<p>which to raise the money, except from the sale of either
</p>
<p>his land or his negroes. He dislikes to give up his home,
</p>
<p>and if he were to propose to sell it to the planter,'No,'
</p>
<p>says the planter,'I don't want your land: it is of no use
</p>
<p>to me: I cannot transport it to South Carolina, Georgia,

<p>Florida, &c. &c.; but I will take negroes at fair valuation to the amount of my claim, otherwise you must
</p>
<p>pay me the cash.'
</p>
<p>"'What is a fair valuation?' asks the Virginia debtor.
</p>
<p>"'I can buy first-rate cotton-field hands,' says the
</p>
<p>cotton-planter,'for $250 per head; but as you owe me,
</p>
<p>and are in a'tight place,' in order to favor you I will
</p>
<p>allow you $300 per head for good field-hands, but not
</p>
<p>a cent more.'
</p>
<p>" So the rich cotton-planter, to satisfy the insignificant
</p>
<p>claim of ten thousand dollars, drives off thirty-three negroes, good field-hands,who to him are as valuable as if
</p>
<p>he had paid one thousand dollars per head for them.
</p>
<p>"Can Virginia afford to raise negroes at $300 per
</p>
<p>head? No; she cannot. Hence it will be observed
</p>
<p>that precisely in the same ratio as negroes depreciate
</p>
<p>in value, Virginia is impoverished, and the cotton
</p>
<p>and sugar States are built up and enriched. We have
</p>
<p>never yet heard the first good reason given by any
</p>
<p>one why Virginia should secede; nor can any one
</p>
<p>point out a single blessing that will be received by
</p>
<p>her in the event of her seceding, unless the abolition
</p>
<p>of slavery from her territory be a blessing.
</p>
<p>" Look at the present state of things in Virginia and
</p>
<p>in the South. Large slave-holders in Virginia, who,
</p>
<p>twelve months ago, were supposed to be worth one
</p>
<p>hundred thousand dollars, are now not worth more than
</p>
<p>two-thirds of that amount; and the day that Virginia
</p>
<p>passes the ordinance of secession, negro property in
</p>
<p>Virginia will become comparatively valueless. The
</p>
<p>cotton and sugar States are not at all affected by the

</p>
<p>the price in labor is so much cheaper that they can

<p>need only raise more produce to make up for the loss in
</p>
<p>prices.
</p>
<p>" Virginia's action of secession is virtually Virginia's
</p>
<p>action for the abolition of all her slave property. Secession is virtually abolitionism. Secession is submission. We are no abolitionist; we are no subrnissionist;
</p>
<p>and, therefore, we are no secessionist. If this be treason,
</p>
<p>our head is ready for the guillotine! But who is the

</p>
<p>indifference to the interests of the Federal Government, from the beginning of the present session of
</p>
<p>Congress up to the time they resigned their seats?
</p>
<p>Why was this? Because, prior to the session of
</p>
<p>Congress, they had determined to secede from the
</p>
<p>Union, and, therefore, felt no interest in the welfare of
</p>
<p>the Union, and did nothing to save it, but every thing
</p>
<p>they could do to break it up. Have not their leading
</p>
<p>men said that neither the enactment of the' Personal
</p>
<p>Liberty Bills,''nor the election of Abraham Lincoln'
</p>
<p>to the Presidency of these United States, was the cause
</p>
<p>of their secession, for that they had desired for'upwards of thirty years' to separate themselves from
</p>
<p>the Union?
</p>
<p>"And, finally, when Virginia officially sends her messenger, Judge Robertson, to advise and consult with them
</p>
<p>in this extreme hour of peril, South Carolina officially
</p>
<p>spurns him, and resolves to enter into no consultation

<p>with him for the sake of the public good. And now

<p>we are told that if the seceding States will return

<p>to the Union, Virginia will not secede; but, unless

<p>they do, Virginia must secede,-she must go with her

<p>disgrace, a degradation, to submit to and live under the

<p>Administration of Mr. Lincoln. Then the idea is simply
</p>
<p>this: if the cotton States will submit to the infamy
</p>
<p>of serving under the incoming Administration, Virginia will! This is cool impudence, is it not? If it
</p>
<p>be no disgrace to serve under the incoming Administration with the cotton States, it is no disgrace to

<p>to come back into the Union and thus disgrace themselves and cause Virginia to be dishonored? Why,

<p>Why was not the Federal Government broken up then?

<p>Have any new developments come to light since?

</p>
<p>ruin of all others. "There is a way," says Holy Writ,
</p>
<p>" that seemeth good unto a man, but the end thereof is
</p>
<p>death." If secession be not the direct and unmistakable road to political and national death, that seemed
</p>
<p>good unto secessionists, then there is no reliance to be
</p>
<p>placed in facts.
</p>
<p>CHAP. II. "Is this the case now?" We had never
</p>
<p>supposed that Virginia had been oppressed to such a
</p>
<p>degree by the Federal Government as to justify her in
</p>
<p>revolting against that Government. Having been a
</p>
<p>citizen of the State of Virginia for more than twenty-five
</p>
<p>years, during a considerable portion of which time we
</p>
<p>have been both a free-holder and the owner of slaves,
</p>
<p>we claim to have some knowledge of the condition of
</p>
<p>affairs in that State; and our honest conviction is that
</p>
<p>Virginia was never in a more prosperous condition than
</p>
<p>she was in at the time of Mr. Lincoln's election. Nor do
</p>
<p>we believe that there was any just reason why the tide
</p>
<p>of prosperity that was flowing over her whole territory
</p>
<p>should have been retarded or interrupted by the election
</p>
<p>of Mr. Lincoln. We presume that, by the present
</p>
<p>time, thousands of Virginians think as we do.
</p>
<p>"The ostensible causes of secession."-One grand and
</p>
<p>never-failing argument, employed and urged with great
</p>
<p>vehemence by the advocates of secession to force Virginia
</p>
<p>out of the Union, was that it would save the South
</p>
<p>from further Abolition aggressions, and free the State and
</p>
<p>country from the continual agitation of the slave question.
</p>
<p>Has secession accomplished this? Let facts speak for
</p>
<p>themselves. We told Virginians that they would bring

</p>
<p>of the Union. They laughed at our folly, mocked at
</p>
<p>our kind admonitions and warnings, and branded us as
</p>
<p>"a traitor to the South," "an enemy to Virginia," "a
</p>
<p>submissionist to old Abe Lincoln," and an "Abolitionist." We bore it all with patience, and were willing to
</p>
<p>endure a thousand times more, if we could have saved
</p>
<p>our happy, beloved country. But judicial blindness
</p>
<p>had seized the people; they were demented.
</p>
<p>"The objects sought to be gained." The Virginia advocates of secession argued that secession would permanently establish the institution of slavery, and extend
</p>
<p>slave territory over millions of acres of land, thus
</p>
<p>opening a great and effectual door to make slavery
</p>
<p>more valuable in Virginia than it had ever been;
</p>
<p>whereas, unless Virginia did secede, an Abolition cordon
</p>
<p>was being established, by w'hich negroes in the State
</p>
<p>would soon become valueless either for sale or hire,-and
</p>
<p>then what would become of men, and whole families, who
</p>
<p>were dependent on the sale and hire of their negroes
</p>
<p>for support? This would be a terrible calamity on
</p>
<p>Virginia,-that is to say, a terrible calamity upon the
</p>
<p>proud, broken-down, mushroom aristocrats and first
</p>
<p>families of Virginia! God knows, there are more
</p>
<p>would-be aristocrats and would-be aristocratic families
</p>
<p>in Virginia than can be found anywhere on the same
</p>
<p>area of territory this side of either lheaven or hell. To
</p>
<p>this class of citizens, the idea of negroes becoming
</p>
<p>valueless was terrible,-yea, more terrible by'far than
</p>
<p>civil war with all its concomitant horrors!

</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>133
</p>
<p>the Gulf States wished to secede for one prominent
</p>
<p>reason, among others, that they might reopen, with
</p>
<p>impunity, the African slave-trade, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>securing cheap slave labor. Such were some of the
</p>
<p>unhallowed motives by which the ambitious and ungodly
</p>
<p>leaders in this infernal rebellion were influenced to
</p>
<p>break up the Government of the United States, and
</p>
<p>introduce and establish an order of things more in
</p>
<p>accordance with their own proud, ungodly, and ambitious aspirations. Htave their sanguine hopes been
</p>
<p>realized? Let facts answer the question.
</p>
<p>":They will never enter into any treaties.".-We believe that African slavery, especially in Virginia, will
</p>
<p>virtually wind up with this war. When the war ends,
</p>
<p>there will be but few negroes in the State, and they will
</p>
<p>be of but little value. Secession was the death-blow to
</p>
<p>African slavery, not only in Virginia, but in the whole
</p>
<p>South, as is now constantly being demonstrated. Nor
</p>
<p>do we believe that any treaties will ever be made by the
</p>
<p>Federal Government and the South which will give
</p>
<p>any guarantee to the latter for the safety and perpetuity
</p>
<p>of the institution of African slavery.
</p>
<p>" Vassals of the few." If the Gulf States could have
</p>
<p>succeeded, and the African slave-trade been reopened,
</p>
<p>the fate of poor white men in the South would have
</p>
<p>been forever sealed. And if the Southern Confederacy
</p>
<p>had her independence now, and a negro-oligarchy were
</p>
<p>established, what would be the condition of "poor white
</p>
<p>people" in that Confederacy? Every sensible man of
</p>
<p>observation in the South and in the slave States can
</p>
<p>readily answer this question.

</p>
<p> Has she not already lost nearly one-half of her
</p>
<p>negro population? Has she not lost thousands of her
</p>
<p>noblest sons and fairest daughters, her money and
</p>
<p>credit? Is she not already bankrupt and ruined?
</p>
<p>Has she not lost her horses and stock, corn and meat,
</p>
<p>silver-ware and valuable household-furniture?-many
</p>
<p>of her fine residences, beautiful villages, and thriving
</p>
<p>towns?-her peace, quiet, and happiness? her sanctuaries, and the regular, undisturbed worship of Almighty God?-the kind feeling, friendship, affection,
</p>
<p>and love which existed among friends, neighbors,
</p>
<p>citizens, and relatives?-her schools, academies, colleges, and all facilities of educating her youth?-all
</p>
<p>she has gained in agricultural improvements, her prosperity and thrift? Her territory has become a common battle-field, and her soil is saturated with the
</p>
<p>blood of the wounded, dead, and dying. She is losing
</p>
<p>al1 that she holds near, dear, and sacred, and her
</p>
<p>history, honor, and glory are being ended in seas of
</p>
<p>blood, and will thus end, when the din and strife of the

<p>battle-field and the thunders of civil war shall have

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED,
</p>
<p>"CHARLESTON, Jan. 28.-The Legislature has adopted
</p>
<p>the following resolutions:
</p>
<p>"Resolved, unanimously, That the General Assembly
</p>
<p>of South Carolina tenders to the Legislature of Virginia their acknowledgment of the friendly motives
</p>
<p>which inspired the mission intrusted to Judge Robertson, her commissioner.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, unanimously, That candor which is due
</p>
<p>to the long-continued sympathy and respect which has
</p>
<p>long subsisted between Virginia and South Carolina
</p>
<p>induces the Assembly to declare, with frankness, that
</p>
<p>they do not deem it advisable to initiate negotiations
</p>
<p>when they have no desire or intention to promote the
</p>
<p>ultimate object in view. That object is declared in the
</p>
<p>resolution of the Virginia Legislature to be the procurement of amendments to, or new guarantees in, the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, unanimously, That the separation of
</p>
<p>South Carolina from the Federal Union is final, and
</p>
<p>she has no further interest in the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States, and that the only appropriate negotiations between her and the Federal Government are as
</p>
<p>to their mutual relations as foreign States.
</p>
<p>"Resolved, unanimously, That this Assembly further
</p>
<p>owes it to her friendly relations to the State of Virginia to declare that they have no confidence in the
</p>
<p>Federal Government of the United States; that the
</p>
<p>most solemn pledges of that Government have been disregarded; that, under pretence of preserving property,
</p>
<p>hostile troops have been attempted to be introduced

</p>
<p>137
</p>
<p>authorities at Washington have been informed of
</p>
<p>the present mediation of Virginia, a vessel of war has
</p>
<p>been sent to the South, and troops and munitions of
</p>
<p>war concentrated on the soil of Virginia.
</p>
<p>"Resozlved, unanimously, That, under these circumstances, this Assembly, in the renewed assurances of
</p>
<p>cordial respect and esteem for the people of Virginia,
</p>
<p>and high consideration for her commissioner, decline
</p>
<p>entering into the negotiations proposed."
</p>
<p>The Legislature, or General Assembly, declared " that
</p>
<p>the separation of South Carolina from the Federal
</p>
<p>Union is final," and the secession orators of Virginia
</p>
<p>declared that they would never "submit to the Administration of Abe Lincoln;" that before they would
</p>
<p>do this they would leave Virginia and locate somewhere within the bounds of the anticipated Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy; that they wanted no compromise,-all
</p>
<p>they wanted was a final and eternal separation from
</p>
<p>the "old Union," which had now become to them
</p>
<p>odious; that it was a degradation, a dishonor, to
</p>
<p>Virginia, the Old D)ominion, the "Mother of States
</p>
<p>and of Statesmen," to submit to Black Republican rule;
</p>
<p>and then they would argue that unless some compromise was adopted, that would bring back the seceded
</p>
<p>States into the Union, Virginia must secede. Hence
</p>
<p>we asked, "Are gentlemen honest, are they sincere,
</p>
<p>when they talk to us thus?"
</p>
<p>The fact is, the original leaders in this accursed
</p>
<p>rebellion never intended to accept of any compromise
</p>
<p>that might be offered; and all their temporizing about
</p>
<p>conventions and this, that, and the other measure was
</p>
<p>only to gain time and opportunity to prepare the pas-.sions of the people for secession, and to swindle'them

</p>
<p>of treason with themselves.
</p>
<p>"Immediately after the John Brown raid." Why
</p>
<p>did not Virginia and the whole South secede immediately after the John Brown raid? Because the
</p>
<p>Southern heart had not been sufficiently fired up. The
</p>
<p>leaders had not made all the necessary preparations.
</p>
<p>Floyd had not sent all the munitions of war belonging
</p>
<p>to the Federal Government down South. The loco-foco
</p>
<p>party had not been defeated; they were living and
</p>
<p>faring sumptuously on the spoils of the "hateful old
</p>
<p>Union;" they were afraid then to talk openly before
</p>
<p>the dear people about breaking up the Federal Government,-the old Union. And during the Presidential
</p>
<p>canvass even the Breckinridge party denied the charge
</p>
<p>of being disunionists, and of intending to secede:
</p>
<p>Newton and Yancey were isolated exceptions. They
</p>
<p>kept the people in the dark as to the true and real
</p>
<p>policy they intended to pursue. The party was defeated, and so soon as defeat came, and they could no
</p>
<p>longer rule the Government, they determined to ruin
</p>
<p>the country; and they have proved but too successful.
</p>
<p>But, thank God, in ruining the innocent and in trying
</p>
<p>to upset and overthrow the Government, they themselves, or at least some of them, will get upset, overthrown, and ruined forever. This is one of the games
</p>
<p>in which the actors, as well as those acted upon, may
</p>
<p>receive a hurt, a deadly wound. And we predict that,
</p>
<p>by the time this war is fully ended, but few of the
</p>
<p>leaders in the rebellion will be found living in the
</p>
<p>United States to enjoy the spoils.

<p>the whole difficulties could, and ultimately would, have

<p>The preceding chapters, it will be remembered, were

<p>written during the time that conventions were being
</p>
<p>held all over the country for the purpose of compromising the national difficulties. Men, from force of
</p>
<p>circumstances, were constantly changing,-hopeful today, but doubting again to-morrow. After having
</p>
<p>written the leading editorials of the 31st of January,
</p>
<p>1861, we find the following paragraph immediately following in the last column containing our editorials.
</p>
<p>Intelligence received from Charleston, South Carolina,
</p>
<p>induced us to write it.
</p>
<p>"We fear, from all that we can learn, that, before the
</p>
<p>Commissioners at Washington shall be able to meet and
</p>
<p>effect any thing for the permanent adjustment of our

<p>national difficulties, the seceding States will plunge
</p>
<p>the country into civil war. There is but little doubt
</p>
<p>that an attack will be made on Fort Sumter in a
</p>
<p>very short time. South Carolina seems bent and determined at every hazard to break up the Federal Government. Her reckless course is destined to bring

<p>down upon her the unqualified condemnation of all

<p>now being acted out before the eyes of all are a sufficient

<p>solution of the problem. There never was a man born

<p>us to utterly detest secession, because secession has

<p>approval, and ratification. This is as it should be. The
</p>
<p>sovereign power is lodged in the people. If they wish
</p>
<p>to go out of the Union, let them vote themselves out,
</p>
<p>and then they will have no one to blame. This will
</p>
<p>give the people time to think on the subject, and will
</p>
<p>enable them to vote more intelligently and safely.
</p>
<p>"Let the kindest fraternal feelings exist among us
</p>
<p>all, remembering that we are all brethren. We are far
</p>
<p>from believing that the Union or conservative members
</p>
<p>of the convention will in the least degree compromise
</p>
<p>the rights and honor of Virginia. Should they fail,
</p>
<p>however, to obtain sufficient guarantees for her safety
</p>
<p>and the protection of her rights under the Federal
</p>
<p>Government, then they will act as one man in defending her safety and securing her rights in every honorable way, with firmness and promptness. This is all
</p>
<p>we ask; it is all we can expect; it is all we wish.
</p>
<p>"Whatever securities Virginia may be willing to
</p>
<p>accept will, we think, be satisfactory to all the border
</p>
<p>States, and should be so to all the slave States. Conservative men will yield no sooner to the aggressions
</p>
<p>of the North than will secessionists. It is the wish
</p>
<p>of conservative men to exhaust all possible means and
</p>
<p>make every honorable effort to restore peace and harmony; but, if they fail at last, then they will all
</p>
<p>strike together,-strike a blow that will be terrible in
</p>
<p>its results. Let Black Republicans remember this.

<p>cast for Union candidates to the Virginia Convention

<p>was upwards of sixty thousand. With this majority

<p>in favor of the Union, we could hardly suppose it possible that Virginia could be dragged out of the Union.
</p>
<p>But we were deceived in our calculation so far as the
</p>
<p>action of the convention was concerned; but, so far
</p>
<p>as regards the voluntary action of the people of the

<p>lied, swindled, and forced out of the Union, as the

</p>
<p>majority vote. The Border States Convention was in
</p>
<p>session at Washington City, and a telegraphic despatch
</p>
<p>from Washington stated that " Ex-President Tyler, on
</p>
<p>taking the chair to-day, [the 5th of February, 1861,]
</p>
<p>delivered an address which was eulogized by those present as highly patriotic and conciliatory." General
</p>
<p>Scott had thrown troops into Washington City for its
</p>
<p>defence, and considered the city a safe place of residence on the 4th of the approaching March. Maryland had not seceded, and seemed to stand firm for
</p>
<p>the Union, as she still continues to do. Things
</p>
<p>seemed to be brightening up; and Union men in Virginia began to feel hopeful that the border States
</p>
<p>would all remain in the Union, and thus save the
</p>
<p>country from one common ruin. True, there were
</p>
<p>many disheartening circumstances when we took an
</p>
<p>impartial view of things on the other side. Secessionists in Virginia were moving every power and straining every nerve to carry Virginia out of the Union.

</p>
<p>Most of the foreign ministers at Washington City
</p>
<p>had sent off despatches to their respective Governments, stating that the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States was practically dissolved. Lieutenant James
</p>
<p>Jewett, United States Navy, had been arrested at Pensacola by the State authorities of Florida, who would
</p>
<p>not permit him to depart unless upon his parole of
</p>
<p>honor that he would never take up arms against the
</p>
<p>State of Florida. Senator Crittenden, of Kentucky, upon
</p>
<p>hearing of this outrage being perpetrated upon a gallant son of his own State, became indignant, and advised
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Jewett to proceed at once to the Secretary
</p>
<p>of the Navy and report the facts, which he did. Warlike preparations continued to progress at Charleston,
</p>
<p>South Carolina, and an attack on Fort Sumter was

<p>daily expected. The times were indeed trying to the
</p>
<p>hearts and feelings of all true patriots.

</p>
<p>the last twelve months, however, we have written more
</p>
<p>or less almost every week on the fearful calamities
</p>
<p>which threaten our glorious country.
</p>
<p>"We saw the perilous condition of the Republic, and
</p>
<p>in our zeal, we have written to try to help save it.
</p>
<p>We knew that, if our country were broken up and
</p>
<p>civil war should begin, there would be an end of all
</p>
<p>our liberties and blessings, political, social, and religious. We have written our views freely, fearlessly,
</p>
<p>and independently. If any have taken exceptions, we
</p>
<p>can't help it. We think, however, that the time will
</p>
<p>come when our course will be commended by all soberthinking, patriotic citizens.
</p>
<p>" So soon as the political storm which is now agitating and convulsing our country shall have passed
</p>
<p>away, we intend to pursue a different course from that
</p>
<p>which has occupied our attention for the last year.
</p>
<p>We begin to hope that the storm will pass over without civil war,-that the Federal Government will continue,-that confidence will be restored,-that peace
</p>
<p>and tranquillity will once more dwell in our midst,that business will become active, and that all things
</p>
<p>will go on prosperously.
</p>
<p>"If Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky,
</p>
<p>Tennessee, &c. &c., remain firm and steadfast, and a
</p>
<p>compromise of our Federal relations shall be adopted
</p>
<p>which will prove satisfactory to these States, we confidently believe that some if not all of the seceded States
</p>
<p>will ultimately return to the Union. If they should
</p>
<p>not, however, let them have their own Confederacy,
</p>
<p>and enjoy in peace and tranquillity all the blessings
</p>
<p>and privileges of which they are capable.

</p>
<p>ultra-abolition States, wish to slab off, let them go andt
</p>
<p>do the best for themselves that they can. It will not
</p>
<p>be many years, in our humble opinion, until all the
</p>
<p>seceded States will be anxious to return to the old
</p>
<p>Union of their fathers. So that, after all, the present
</p>
<p>national excitement may result in infinite good to the
</p>
<p>whole country. If, however, the seceded States, and
</p>
<p>those, if any, which may hereafter secede, shall never
</p>
<p>return to the Union, all sections can go on and govern
</p>
<p>their own affairs without detriment to each other,
</p>
<p>and the whole country may continue in peace and
</p>
<p>prosperity.
</p>
<p>"If the'Peace Conference' now in session in Washington City shall adjust a plan satisfactory to the border
</p>
<p>States, this is all we can expect or hope for at the
</p>
<p>present critical crisis. And we again repeat, and would
</p>
<p>impress it upon the minds of our readers, that if the
</p>
<p>States which have already seceded will not come back
</p>
<p>into the Union, this is no reason why the border States
</p>
<p>shall go omut of the Union. There is a principle or law
</p>
<p>in natural philosophy that supposes the smaller bodies
</p>
<p>to be attracted by the larger. But in the present case
</p>
<p>the smaller bodies, or seceded States, seek to force the

<p>larger bodies, or non-seceding States, and bring them

<p>under their influence.

<p>to the future, under all the trying circumstances, as

<p>possible; and, as cold winter is passing away, and

<p>did they vacate their seats in the Senate and Congress

<p>all their rights into the hands of their enemies? Why,
</p>
<p>in the hour of their country's peril, did they retreat

<p>into the Gulf States, having as a safeguard the Atlantic Ocean on the one side, and the border States between them and danger on the other side? There is
</p>
<p>no submission in all this, is there? Very brave, is it?
</p>
<p>In what have Union men compromised their honor or
</p>
<p>dignity? It is not honorable, not dignified, for a man
</p>
<p>to stand his ground and fight for his rights on his own
</p>
<p>soil, and sacredly maintain the trust the people have

<p>confided in him! But it is very honorable, quite dignified, for a man to throw down his legal weapons of
</p>
<p>defence and run away, and belt on the sword, and swear

<p>if the enemy comes to him he'll thrash him out! This

<p>is very brave, is it?

<p>"What rights have secessionists to protect that

<p>any thing else than "pouring oil on the troubled waters,"
</p>
<p>secesh understrappers, politicians, and fifteen-shilling

<p>lawyers were haranguing the people through the country
</p>
<p>and stirring up all the baser and vindictive passions of
</p>
<p>the ignorant and credulous classes of the people. They
</p>
<p>sneered at the idea of any compromise. None but " Traitors to the South," "Submissionists," "Black Republicans," "Abolitionists," "Old Lincolnites," "Union-shriekers," and " Cowards" wanted to compromise with bluenecked, white-livered Yankees! To listen to the stentorian

<p>and statesmen, one would be induced to suppose that

<p>HOPE FOR THE UNION WANES-JEFF DAVIS'S SPEECH IN
</p>
<p>MONTGOMERY-GENERAL REMARKS, ETC. ETC.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of February 21, 1861, under the head of " Random Thoughts,"
</p>
<p>we wrote and published the following:"'Tis folly to try to hope longer for an amicable
</p>
<p>adjustment of our Federal or national difficulties. The
</p>
<p>star of hope has gone down beneath the hill of despair.
</p>
<p>To talk longer of compromise is sublime nonsense,superlatively ludicrous. No compromise would at the
</p>
<p>present time bring back the seceded States. Mr.
</p>
<p>Davis, in his Inaugural Address, says,"'I enter upon the duties of the office for which I
</p>
<p>have been chosen with the hope that the beginning of
</p>
<p>our career as a confederacy may not be obstructed by
</p>
<p>hostile opposition to the enjoyment of the separate and

<p>independent existence which we have asserted, and
</p>
<p>which, with the blessing of Providence, we intend to
</p>
<p>maintain. We have entered upon our career of independence, and it must be inflexibly pursued. If a just
</p>
<p>perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably
</p>
<p>to pursue our separate political career, my most earnest
</p>
<p>desire will have been fulfilled. But, if this be denied

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>solve, to appeal to arms, and invoke the blessings of
</p>
<p>Providence upon a just cause.'
</p>
<p>"In his address at the depot, on arriving in Montgomery, Mr. Davis said,"'We are now determined to maintain our position,
</p>
<p>and make all who -oppose us smell Southern powder
</p>
<p>and feel Southern steel, if coercion be persisted in.
</p>
<p>We will maintain our rights and our government at
</p>
<p>all hazards. We ask nothing, want nothing, and will
</p>
<p>have no complication. If other States join our confederation, they can freely come on our terms. Our
</p>
<p>separation from the old Union is complete. No compromise, no thought of reconstruction, will now be entertained.'
</p>
<p>"If President Davis be a correct exponent of the
</p>
<p>views of the people of the six seceded States, then the
</p>
<p>Rubicon is forever passed. Why, then, talk about
</p>
<p>compromise any longer? The border States must be
</p>
<p>forced to join the Southern Confederacy on just such
</p>
<p>terms as she may be pleased to receive them.'They
</p>
<p>can freely come on our terms.' Hence they have no
</p>
<p>voice in the matter at all. Are freemen to be menaced
</p>
<p>and talked to in this way? So the border States at
</p>
<p>last have to yield to the dictates of the seceded
</p>
<p>States!
</p>
<p>"A provisional Government! Remember that the
</p>
<p>laws of this provisional Government are only to continue for the term of one year, until permanent laws
</p>
<p>are enacted and a permanent constitution adopted.
</p>
<p>Will the laws of this anticipated firm confederacy be
</p>
<p>favorable to the interests of Virginia and the other

<p>border States? Who can tell? Who can believe

</p>
<p>153
</p>
<p>the border States that this new confederacy will not
</p>
<p>reopen the African slave-trade? None whatever! If
</p>
<p>the African slave-trade is not reopened, then the seceded States will be forced to purchase slaves from
</p>
<p>Virginia. One thing is certain: they are going to get
</p>
<p>their negroes just where they can purchase them
</p>
<p>cheapest. This is a fixed fact. We have not a doubt
</p>
<p>that thousands and tens of thousands of African negroes will be smuggled into the cotton States and sold
</p>
<p>into bondage, in defiance of all laws to the contrary.
</p>
<p>We are afraid of the wooden horse! There are deep
</p>
<p>groans within!
</p>
<p>" It now behooves Virginia to demand such guarantees as will secure her own property and safety, without
</p>
<p>having any reference to the seceded States. And if
</p>
<p>Virginia is satisfied that her property will be protected,
</p>
<p>she ought to be contented and remain in the Union,
</p>
<p>and then business will become active, confidence will
</p>
<p>be restored, and prosperity will follow."

<p>instance of such an anomaly as is now presented to the

</p>
<p>in these disrupted States. Within ninety days the

<p>before the people, there would be no convention. But
</p>
<p>with that Legislature the secession of Virginia was a
</p>
<p>foregone conclusion; and they usurped the authority
</p>
<p>of calling a convention, and then remained in session
</p>
<p>during the session of the convention to act as an outside pressure upon that convention to force Virginia
</p>
<p>out of the Union. This, facts abundantly prove, and
</p>
<p>we shall say more on the subject hereafter.
</p>
<p>" Why, then, send them?" Why were commissioners
</p>
<p>being sent to and from Virginia, to and from the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy, for the purpose of compromising
</p>
<p>difficulties, when Mr. Davis openly said, "We ask nothing, want nothing, and will have no complication. Our
</p>
<p>separation from the old Union is complete. No compromise, no thought of reconstruction, will now be
</p>
<p>entertained"? Strange as it may now appear to the
</p>
<p>intelligent reader, the leaders of disunion, the orators
</p>
<p>of the secession party, still urged upon the people
</p>
<p>that unless some compromise was devised and adopted,
</p>
<p>which would bring back the seceded States into the
</p>
<p>Union, Virginia must secede. It was all a deep, damnable plot of treason, a trap set to catch Virginia and
</p>
<p>force her out of the Union,-a political swindle, a trick
</p>
<p>and cheat, imposed upon her, for which she will hold
</p>
<p>the guilty culprits responsible after this war shall have
</p>
<p>ended,-if they are then living; and, if not, her wrath
</p>
<p>and fiery indignation will be hurled upon their guilty
</p>
<p>souls throughout the undying ages of eternity. The
</p>
<p>souls of the thousands slain on Virginia's soil will rise
</p>
<p>up in the day of judgment, and condemn the guilty

<p>leaders in this wicked rebellion, because by it they

<p>were unexpectedly forced into battle, and consequently

<p>A special despatch to the "Petersburg Express,"

<p>dated Richmond, February 27, 10~ P.M., announced the

<p>following intelligence:"A member of the Virginia Legislature has just received the following despatch from Washington:"'The Peace Congress have agreed upon a plan of

<p>adjustment, which, it is hoped, will prove satisfactory
</p>
<p>to all parties. The object was consummated to-day.

<p>"'We fire a salute of one hundred guns in the morning, in honor of the great event, by order of the Government.'

<p>Why did not the secessionists at Richmond " at all

<p>~A Washington correspondent of the "Richmond Dispatch," in a letter to that paper after the inauguration
</p>
<p>of Mr. Lincoln, explains the whole matter. The correspondent says,"Lincoln threatens war because he knows his hands
</p>
<p>are tied. War is not the thing we ought to fear. Peace
</p>
<p>is our destruction; war our salvation."
</p>
<p>The "Alexandria Gazette," in commenting on the
</p>
<p>above, said,"Is not this significant? Is it not'rule or ruin'?
</p>
<p>Will not the people of Virginia mark this? Will they
</p>
<p>yield themselves to those who hold and express such
</p>
<p>sentiments,-sentiments destructive to their best and
</p>
<p>dearest interests and utterly subversive of their highest
</p>
<p>hopes? We are to desire war, civil war, bloodshed,

<p>every thing calculated to ruin us, so that secession

<p>may be carried out here and protected elsewhere!

<p>the politicians of the country, we therefore exhort our

<p>brethren to lay aside all their feelings, surrender forever the ties that have bound them to favorite leaders,

<p>preservation of the Federal Union.

<p>that the ship of state has been too long confided to men

<p>who are unworthy of the trust, and who have permitted her to run upon the quicksands of sectional strife;

<p>we will, therefore, vote against aspiring demagogues,

<p>SECESH CAUCUS CLIQUES GREAT SECESH MEETING AND

<p>UNION MEETING IN FREDERICKSBURG-IMPOSITION OF
</p>
<p>SECESH ORATORS-SECESH REMARKS, ETC. ETC.
</p>
<p>ON the first Monday in March, 1861, at Spottsylvania Court-House, that being county-court day, a
</p>
<p>clique of secessionists met then and there, and passed a
</p>
<p>set of resolutions, among which was one instructing
</p>
<p>the representative from the county of Spottsylvania
</p>
<p>and the town of Fredericksburg to the Virginia Convention, which was then being held in the city of Richmond, to urge the immediate passage of an ordinance
</p>
<p>of secession, the representative from this county having
</p>
<p>been elected a member of the convention as a Union
</p>
<p>man by an overwhelming majority. These resolutions
</p>
<p>were hurried off to Richmond to influence the representative in his future course of action, and published
</p>
<p>in the public newspapers as being the wish of the
</p>
<p>voters of the county. Thus was the representative
</p>
<p>imposed upon, as were also the voters and people of
</p>
<p>the county. Be it remembered that fifteen-shilling

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>were generally at the head of all these treasonable
</p>
<p>cliques.
</p>
<p>On the following Friday night this same party called
</p>
<p>a town-meeting for the purpose of imposing and forcing
</p>
<p>the same set of resolutions upon the voters and citizens
</p>
<p>of Fredericksburg. This meeting was largely attended
</p>
<p>and ably represented by those who had respectively
</p>
<p>advocated the interests of Bell, Breckinridge, and
</p>
<p>Douglas during the Presidential campaign of 1860.
</p>
<p>Eight consecutive disunion speeches were delivered by
</p>
<p>eight lawyers. The speakers who had advocated the
</p>
<p>cause of Bell and Douglas during the Presidential
</p>
<p>canvass declared themselves wholly converted, head
</p>
<p>and heels, soul and body, to the inexpressible beauties,
</p>
<p>undying excellencies, and transcendently sublime glories
</p>
<p>of secession, and most unmercifully and vindictively
</p>
<p>denounced all as Abolitionists, traitors, submissionists,
</p>
<p>and Lincolnites, who would any longer stand up for the
</p>
<p>old Union, or the flag of the old United States. On
</p>
<p>this occasion the stentorian style was admirably imitated by all the speakers. They seemed to try to
</p>
<p>what an astonishing height they could raise their voices,
</p>
<p>and to what an extent they could be heard; they were
</p>
<p>verbose, vehement, denunciatory, dogmatic, impudent,
</p>
<p>insolent, disgusting, and highly insulting; but as for
</p>
<p>common sense, good logic, sound argument, and mathematical demonstration, there was none of it,-except
</p>
<p>that they demonstrated their own folly and final ruin
</p>
<p>by their own treasonable course of conduct. That this
</p>
<p>would prove to be the result of their action was clearly
</p>
<p>demonstrated to our own mind at least.

</p>
<p>(the audience) "see every day; and if Virginia did not

<p>secede, and if he, the speaker, did not leave Virginia,
</p>
<p>his "wife is going any way, as she has determined not
</p>
<p>to live under old Abe's Administration." Another was
</p>
<p>going to root up roots out of the ground and make his
</p>
<p>wife and children do the same for a living, before he
</p>
<p>and they should become the subjects of old Lincoln's
</p>
<p>tyranny and despotic rule. Another was going to face
</p>
<p>the cannon-yes, walk right square up to the cannon's
</p>
<p>mouth and wade in blood up to his neck-before he
</p>
<p>would ever submit to the despotism of a Black Republican Abolition Administration. It was a great time
</p>
<p>with secessionists. The rapping and clapping and
</p>
<p>loud huzzas were frequent, long, and deafening. Oh,
</p>
<p>they were a merry, jubilant set of fellows that night!
</p>
<p>If it had been an old-fashioned Methodist camp-meeting, and a thousand sinners had become converted to
</p>
<p>God, the enthusiasm and extravagance could not have
</p>
<p>been surpassed.
</p>
<p>Strange as it may appear to the reader, not one of
</p>
<p>the pugnacious orators who were going to turn the
</p>
<p>world upside down and play the devil generally on that
</p>
<p>ever-memorable night has ever yet faced the mouth of

<p>a roaring cannon, or waded in blood. up to his neck,
</p>
<p>or even been in a battle, so far as we know. One of

<p>the most popular and prominent of all who spoke on
</p>
<p>that occasion subsequently offered for the Congress of
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy, but, getting shamefully defeated, he afterwards became attached to the staff of

<p>one of the Confederate generals, with the title of major

<p>Democrat, a great admirer of Jeff Davis, a thorough

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>secessionist, a despiser of the old Union, and a scorner
</p>
<p>of the "Stars and Stripes." He was rich, and with his
</p>
<p>party, before the war began, influential; but since the
</p>
<p>war commenced his negroes have left, his "beautiful"
</p>
<p>residence and splendid farm have become the headquarters of the generals of the Federal army, and his
</p>
<p>farm a common camping-field. He is now comparatively poor, and, except with original secessionists, his
</p>
<p>influence is gone, and gone forever.
</p>
<p>Another one of the eloquent orators on that occasion
</p>
<p>was a Breckinridge Democrat; but during the reign of
</p>
<p>Know-Nothingism he was a great Know-Nothingist,
</p>
<p>and, if we are not mistaken, he is emphatically a Know-.\othingist yet, having learned nothing since,-a nineshilling lawyer, a worshipper of Jeff Davis, a despiser
</p>
<p>of the old Union, a scorner of the " detestable flag of the
</p>
<p>Federal Government," but a devoted friend, a sincere
</p>
<p>lover, of the one thing which most traitors admire,
</p>
<p>whiskey. This man was for a short time a lieutenant
</p>
<p>in a company when the rebellion first broke out, but,
</p>
<p>when the "tug of war" actually came, fearing, as was
</p>
<p>supposed, that he might get into a fight and by some
</p>
<p>unforeseen accident might "get hurt," resigned his office;
</p>
<p>and when the conscript law took effect, and scoutingparties were hunting out and picking up fighting-men
</p>
<p>in, around, and about Fredericksburg, we understand
</p>
<p>that this poor fellow, this would-be hero in time of
</p>
<p>peace, when there was no danger of "getting hurt,"
</p>
<p>was slipping and sliding, dodging, running, and hiding,
</p>
<p>from place to place, to keep from being caught and
</p>
<p>forced into the conscript army to fight against "submissionists and the disciples of old Abe Lincoln"!

<p>He had declined all idea of fighting "old Abe Lin

<p>coln" and "the blue-necked, white-livered Yankees."
</p>
<p>lie found it was much easier to make treasonable
</p>
<p>secesh speeches, and be huzzaed by brainless knaves
</p>
<p>and foolish boys, than to fight the "vandals of the
</p>
<p>North," and consequently, like "Jerry Sneak, he
</p>
<p>turned edge-ways and became invisible," or, like the
</p>
<p>return on a constable's warrant, non est inventus.
</p>
<p>But to return to the meeting. All the orators of the
</p>
<p>night and of the occasion having delivered themselves
</p>
<p>of the eloquence which was pent up within them,
</p>
<p>and the thunders of the loud huzzas having died away,
</p>
<p>the resolutions were read and the vote taken, and pronounced by the chair to be unanimous, with but one
</p>
<p>solitary exception. One poor, thoughtless fellow in the
</p>
<p>vast assembly said no to the resolutions,-when a simultaneous shout like deafening thunder arose, "Put him
</p>
<p>out! put him out! put him out!" whereupon one of the
</p>
<p>tender-hearted lawyers, (and they all have tender hearts,
</p>
<p>reader,) who had just delivered himself of a treasonable
</p>
<p>speech, and seeing unconditional glory, honor, and immortality ahead, said, "No, no, no: don't put him out;
</p>
<p>he is evidently intoxicated." The inference, therefore,
</p>
<p>to be fairly drawn was that none but a drunken man
</p>
<p>would dare to vote against the resolutions; while the
</p>
<p>actual fact in the case was, that this poor fellow's carcass only escaped being kicked out of the public courthouse into the streets on the plea of his being drunk.
</p>
<p>The meeting having adjourned, we left the courthouse, seriously cogitating upon the lamentable scenes
</p>
<p>which had just been acted out, and the awfully alarming
</p>
<p>state of public affairs generally, and, like the old prophet of whom we read in the Bible, from the depth of

<p>our soul we exclaimed, "Lord, they have killed thy
</p>
<p>168
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>prophets, digged down thine altars, and I am left alone,
</p>
<p>and they seek my life." Like the old prophet, however,
</p>
<p>we were mistaken; for in that very assembly there were
</p>
<p>many who had never bowed the knee to the image of
</p>
<p>Baal, and who in their hearts despised the demon
</p>
<p>secession, as subsequent events proved.
</p>
<p>Resolutions which were passed by these secesh
</p>
<p>caucus-meetings, which were everywhere being held
</p>
<p>through the country, were hurried off to Richmond to
</p>
<p>the representatives in the State Convention, as we
</p>
<p>have already said, to force and influence them to vote
</p>
<p>for the immediate secession of Virginia; otherwise, on
</p>
<p>their return home they would be held accountable to
</p>
<p>their constituents for not having obeyed instructions.
</p>
<p>These resolutions were also published in the public
</p>
<p>newspapers, and largely commented on by editors, to
</p>
<p>influence and force the people into secession, and to
</p>
<p>prepare their minds and hearts for action at the
</p>
<p>election that was to take place relative to ratifying or
</p>
<p>rejecting the final action of the Virginia Convention.
</p>
<p>Many of the meetings which were held and at which
</p>
<p>were passed resolutions instructing representatives in
</p>
<p>the convention to vote for immediate secession were composed of but few individuals, and they, for the most part,
</p>
<p>original secessionists of the baser sort, while the resolutions professed to be a fair representation of the sentiments of whole cities, counties, and communities. The
</p>
<p>intelligent reader cannot fail to see that in this way, if
</p>
<p>the members of the convention, in consequence of their
</p>
<p>superior advantages, were not imposed on, the people
</p>
<p>through the State were.

<p>these resolutions so far as the town and citizens of
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>169
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg were concerned, the Union men of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg determined to hold a Union meeting in
</p>
<p>the court-house on the following Monday night after
</p>
<p>the secesh had held theirs. On Sunday morning we
</p>
<p>were waited on by Union gentlemen to know if we
</p>
<p>would deliver an address on the following night, provided they could "get up".a meeting. For reasons
</p>
<p>satisfactory to ourself, we told them we would. We
</p>
<p>had written for our country, were willing to speak for
</p>
<p>our country, and, if necessary, would die for our country.
</p>
<p>The notice being short, and for a Union meeting, and
</p>
<p>there being no chance to announce it in any of the town
</p>
<p>papers, as there was no daily paper in town, and no
</p>
<p>paper published on Monday, we calculated on quite a
</p>
<p>small attendance.
</p>
<p>No sooner, however, had it become known that there
</p>
<p>was to be a Union meeting than the secessionists went
</p>
<p>to work to devise ways and means by which either to
</p>
<p>turn the Union meeting into a secesh meeting, or, if
</p>
<p>they failed in that, to create a "row," and break up
</p>
<p>the meeting entirely. Facts subsequently developed
</p>
<p>proved this to have been the determination of the opposition party. At the head of this plot there were
</p>
<p>men who should have blushed to engage in such meanness. But to what depths of crime and meanness will
</p>
<p>not treason stoop?
</p>
<p>On entering the court-house on Monday night, we
</p>
<p>found it perfectly filled. Ignorant of the plot of the
</p>
<p>secessionists either to turn the meeting into a secesh
</p>
<p>meeting or attempt to annihilate it, we were surprised
</p>
<p>to witness so large an attendance; for never had we
</p>
<p>seen the court-house more thoroughly crowded than
</p>
<p>on that ever-memorable night, the 11th of March, 1861.

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the meeting was organized, and
</p>
<p>the committee appointed to prepare resolutions for the
</p>
<p>meeting had retired, the chair, in the name of the
</p>
<p>meeting, expressed a desire to hear an address. Instantly the secessionists called out for a certain lawyer,
</p>
<p>who had been a Douglas elector during the Presidential canvass, and one of the men who had spoken
</p>
<p>on the previous Friday night. At the same time the
</p>
<p>Union men were calling on us to take the stand. Being
</p>
<p>seated in the crowd, before we had time to rise and get
</p>
<p>fairly on the way to the speaker's stand, the secesh
</p>
<p>lawyer was on the stand and had commenced his speech.
</p>
<p>We returned to our seat until he had finished He' put it on thick and heavy" to the Union-shriekers, submissionists, Abolitionists,'c. ic. We looked at him,
</p>
<p>and wondered all the time, thinking to ourself, "How
</p>
<p>changed! how fallen!" We had listened to him on the
</p>
<p>previous Friday night; we had heard him when advocating the cause of Douglas, the Union, the Constitution, and enforcement of the laws. Then he was manly,
</p>
<p>dignified, eloquent, logical, and patriotic. As a friend,
</p>
<p>we loved him; as a citizen, we respected him; as a
</p>
<p>patriot, we admired him. Now, as a traitor to his
</p>
<p>country, we pitied him; for his treason, we scorned
</p>
<p>him. Scarcely had he finished his last treasonable
</p>
<p>sentence when a shout was raised for another secesh
</p>
<p>speaker to take the stand. They called on this occasion for their ablest and most popular speakers. Again
</p>
<p>the Union men called on us to take the stand. Feeling
</p>
<p>under obligation to our friends, but infinitely more to
</p>
<p>our country, we walked upon the stand, where, to our

</p>
<p>surprise, we found the last secesh orator who had
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>171
</p>
<p>been called out was standing and trying to gain the
</p>
<p>hearing of the audience.
</p>
<p>Here followed a scene that beggars all description.
</p>
<p>For upwards of fifteen minutes the tumult was like the
</p>
<p>continuous roaring of many waters,-each party calling on their speaker to go on, go on, go on, and each
</p>
<p>swearing that the speaker of the other party should not
</p>
<p>speak. It was a rich scene for civilized, patriotic,
</p>
<p>Christian men! But it was a struggle between- patriotism and treason, a struggle for our country and
</p>
<p>all the blessings of freedom. Finally, however, the
</p>
<p>house was brought to order, and we addressed the
</p>
<p>meeting for about an hour and a half, amidst the
</p>
<p>huzzas and hisses of that vast assembly. During the
</p>
<p>time we were speaking, some cowardly, unprincipled
</p>
<p>scoundrel, a sinner against God, and a traitor to his
</p>
<p>country, threw an egg at us from the extreme part of
</p>
<p>the house; but, losing its force before it reached us, it
</p>
<p>struck a young man who was seated directly in front
</p>
<p>of us, on the back of the head. Why did this outlaw
</p>
<p>bring eggs with him to a public meeting, unless he had
</p>
<p>anticipated a mob on the occasion? Had he no preconceived design in doing this? Had he no accomplices committed to aid in creating a mob and breaking
</p>
<p>up the meeting? Why was he not instantly rebuked,
</p>
<p>arrested, and committed to jail for so outrageous an
</p>
<p>act? Because the leaders of the secession party in
</p>
<p>that house, on that occasion, sanctioned the infernal act,
</p>
<p>and would have joined in a general mob, but that they
</p>
<p>found the Union party much stronger than they had
</p>
<p>expected. Why were the secesh orators, and the very
</p>
<p>men, too, who had delivered speeches on the previous

</p>
<p>Friday night to the same people and in the same house,
</p>
<p>172
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>on the same stand,-why, we say, was an attempt made
</p>
<p>by their party to force them upon the meeting? And
</p>
<p>why did these speakers so promptly take the stand
</p>
<p>and try to impose themselves on the meeting? Ay,
</p>
<p>reader, the damnable~ principles of the tyranny, anarchy, and mob-despotism of secession were as fully developed on that occasion on a small scale, as they are
</p>
<p>in the army of Jeff Davis on a large scale. We,
</p>
<p>however, told them many things, on that occasion,
</p>
<p>which will be remembered by some until they die.
</p>
<p>At the close of our address, a simultaneous shout
</p>
<p>was raised for a certain secesh orator to take the stand
</p>
<p>and make a speech. Instantly he was on the stand,
</p>
<p>overcoat off, and about to begin, when the Union
</p>
<p>men objected to his speaking, inasmuch as it was a
</p>
<p>Union meeting, and already one of the secesh orators
</p>
<p>had made a long disunion speech, and, to the Union
</p>
<p>men, a very insulting and abusive one. The secessionists swore he should speak, and many of the Union
</p>
<p>men swore he should not speak; and, amidst hisses,
</p>
<p>huzzas, clapping of hands, stamping of feet, beating
</p>
<p>of seats and stoves with walking-canes, &c. &c., the
</p>
<p>Union men proceeded to extinguish the lights, as they
</p>
<p>had a right to do, having paid for them, when an instant, general " skedaddling" took place, for fear " somebody" might " get hurt."
</p>
<p>Thus, reader, ended the last Union meeting we ever
</p>
<p>attended in the town of Fredericksburg, Va. We give
</p>
<p>this case and the facts connected with it, as a specimen of
</p>
<p>the trickery, villany, and deep, damnable rascality
</p>
<p>resorted to by secessionists to force Virginia out of the

<p>Union. We had no vindictive feelings towards our fellow-citizens, none but pity for them, and deep, pungent
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>173
</p>
<p>sorrow for the approaching downfall of our bleeding
</p>
<p>country. And, remember, all this happened more than
</p>
<p>one month before the capture of Fort Sumter.
</p>
<p>It may not be amiss to state, in closing this article,
</p>
<p>that two of the prominent speakers on the Friday night
</p>
<p>of the great secesh meeting of which we have spoken
</p>
<p>were during the reign of Know-Nothingism the
</p>
<p>strongest advocates of that cause to be found in all the
</p>
<p>country. One, of whom we have made mention above,
</p>
<p>was a sort of editor in Western Virginia at that
</p>
<p>time; and the other, decidedly the ablest member
</p>
<p>of the Fredericksburg bar, ably advocated the cause
</p>
<p>of Know-Nothingism. On one occasion, in the courthouse in Fredericksburg, and on the same stand where
</p>
<p>he delivered his speech of treason against the Federal Government, we listened to him speak for four
</p>
<p>hours at a single stretch, when all the powers and
</p>
<p>eloquence of his soul and tongue were employed in
</p>
<p>vindicating the "Union, the Constitution, and enforcement of the laws." What a leap from the sublime to
</p>
<p>the ridiculous, from the highest and noblest aspirations of patriotism to the deepest and darkest depths
</p>
<p>of treason! How the sworn advocates of the "Constitution, the Union, and enforcement of the laws" could
</p>
<p>thus easily wheel into the ranks of traitors and espouse
</p>
<p>the cause of treason, was, and is still, to us a mystery,
</p>
<p>an inexplicable enigma, a problem to be solved.
</p>
<p>The "Virginia (Fredericksburg) Herald," in noticing the meeting of the secessionists on the Friday
</p>
<p>night of which we have spoken, says,"There has been a reaction, just as we have always
</p>
<p>said there would be; and it has come like a groundswell in old Fredericksburg."

<p>174
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>To this, in the number of the " Christian Banner"
</p>
<p>of March 14, 1861, we remarked, in the following brief
</p>
<p>paragraph,"How long has the'Herald''always said there
</p>
<p>would be a reaction,' and an upheaving,'like a groundswell,' throwing off the scurf and scum,'Union men,
</p>
<p>or revolutionists, the allies of Black Republicans, Abolitionists, and traitors,' who'leave their slime behind
</p>
<p>them as they walk the streets of Fredericksburg'?
</p>
<p>How long will it be before another'reaction, a groundswell in old Fredericksburg,' takes place, throwing
</p>
<p>off secessionists and those who would precipitate our
</p>
<p>happy country into a civil war?"
</p>
<p>Strange as it may appear to the intelligent reader,
</p>
<p>the "Virginia Herald" had always been, from the
</p>
<p>time of our acquaintance with it, (and that was for
</p>
<p>more than fifteen years,) an uncompromising Whig
</p>
<p>journal, the organ of that party in Fredericksburg,
</p>
<p>and the gentleman who was the editor at the time of
</p>
<p>which we are writing had been an uncompromising
</p>
<p>Whig, and one of the strongest supporters of Bell and
</p>
<p>Everett to be found in all Virginia,-a man in whose
</p>
<p>nostrils the loco-foco or -Democratic party strunk. He
</p>
<p>denounced the Breckinridge party as disunionists
</p>
<p>during the whole Presidential campaign of 1860, and
</p>
<p>placed at the head of his paper, as a motto, "The
</p>
<p>Union, the Constitution, and enforcement of the laws."
</p>
<p>And early in the month of March, 1861, a little over
</p>
<p>three months from the election of Mr. Lincoln, he unfurls the contemptible secession flag, and declares to
</p>
<p>the world openly and publicly in his paper that
</p>
<p>"there has been a reaction, just as we have always

<p>said there would be; and it has come like a ground

</p>
<p>swell in old Fredericksburg." - Always, with the
</p>
<p>Herald, is about sixty days, and, at the furthest, not
</p>
<p>more than ninety days!
</p>
<p>In the notice the "Virginia Herald" gave of the
</p>
<p>Union meeting on Monday night, it says,"The vote was taken, and, from the sound, we
</p>
<p>suppose from twenty-five to fifty were in favor of
</p>
<p>them," (the resolutions.) "The noes predominated
</p>
<p>largely."
</p>
<p>To which we replied, in the number of the "Christian Banner" of March 14, 1861, as follows:"Is it possible that our neighbor of the'Herald'
</p>
<p>can'suppose,'' from the sound' of the vote taken on
</p>
<p>Monday night, that there were only'from twenty-five
</p>
<p>to fifty' Union votes given? He makes a long jump,
</p>
<p>from twenty-five to fifty. Why did he not say from
</p>
<p>twenty-five to one hundred and fifty? How could he
</p>
<p>leap to the positive conclusion that'the noes predominated largely'? We are informed, by a gentleman who was in the crowd, that one man' yelled' out
</p>
<p>no, nine times. Our honest conviction is that a
</p>
<p>majority of the voters, and especially of the propertyholders, in the town of Fredericksburg are opposed to
</p>
<p>immediate secession. Time, however, will prove all
</p>
<p>things."

<p>The "Virginia Herald" said,"Mr. Rowe took the stand, and advocated immediate secession."

<p>Why did not the "Herald" state the ridiculous and

</p>
<p>add any thing to the character and influence of the
</p>
<p>secession party abroad.
</p>
<p>The " Fredericksburg News," in a short notice of the
</p>
<p>meeting on Monday night,-another Whig journal, a
</p>
<p>strong advocate of Bell and Everett,-said," G. H. C. Rowe and James W. Hunnicutt addressed
</p>
<p>the meeting in favor of'revolution and fighting, not
</p>
<p>secession and retreat.' Anarchy seems to be upon us."
</p>
<p>To this we replied, in the same number of the "Banner," namely, the 14th of March, 1861,"The reader will perceive that the'Herald' and'News' differ widely as to the position of Mr. Rowe.
</p>
<p>The'Herald' states Mr. Rowe's position correctly.'Mr. Rowe advocated immediate secession.' Our position is'revolution and fighting' if necessary, and'not
</p>
<p>secession and retreat.' Let us demand our rights, fight
</p>
<p>for our rights, and maintain our rights to the death,
</p>
<p>and, if we fall in the fight, let us fight bravely and die
</p>
<p>honorably. Never fly from our rights and ignobly
</p>
<p>yield them up into the hands of our enemies.
</p>
<p>"Judging from the proceedings of last Monday
</p>
<p>night, it would seem that the reign of anarchy and
</p>
<p>terror is inaugurated. But free men and brave men
</p>
<p>will never yield to the dictations of tyrants and demagogues."
</p>
<p>We have given the above extracts to show to the
</p>
<p>reader that the secession party resorted to every conceivable means to crush out and annihilate the Union
</p>
<p>men of Virginia. Their orators lied, and slandered the
</p>
<p>Union party. Their public newspapers lied, and slandered the Union men of Virginia. And just as soon

</p>
<p>177
</p>
<p>converted to secession and were baptized into the cauldron containing the hellish liquid of Southern treason,
</p>
<p>they were as vituperative and vindictive in their denunciations of Union men as the original secessionists.
</p>
<p>The reader who was not a witness to the scenes which
</p>
<p>were acted out in Virginia during the year 1861 can
</p>
<p>form no adequate conception of the state of excitement
</p>
<p>which prevailed among all classes, sexes, ages, and conditions. Hell was spread out miscellaneously among
</p>
<p>the people, and all the discordant passions of the whole
</p>
<p>mass were stirred up, and the devil let loose generally.
</p>
<p>We had already become convinced that the real issue
</p>
<p>between secessionists and Union men was the simple
</p>
<p>question whether mind and liberty should govern institutions and tyranny, or whether institutions and
</p>
<p>despotism should govern mind and freedom. In other
</p>
<p>words, whether three hundred and fifty thousand slaveholders should rule and govern thirty millions of
</p>
<p>American citizens, or whether thirty millions of American citizens should rule three hundred and fifty thousand slave-holders. Are thirty millions of men capable
</p>
<p>of self-government? Three hundred and fifty thousand
</p>
<p>negro-aristocrats respond, " No, they are not; and we
</p>
<p>will engage to rule and govern them." The proceedings
</p>
<p>of the two meetings of which we have written in this
</p>
<p>chapter more fully than ever convinced us of the correctness of our former conclusion. The reign of terror
</p>
<p>and despotism had begun. Reason and liberty were

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of
</p>
<p>March 21, 1861, we wrote and published the following:"PROVIDENCE-CAUSE AND EFFECT-COMMON SENSE,
</p>
<p>ETC. ETC.
</p>
<p>" It is often said that'Providence will overrule all
</p>
<p>things for the best.' We have great faith in Providence; but Providence does not destroy cause and effect,
</p>
<p>unless when the laws of nature are reversed and miracles are performed.
</p>
<p>" To every law of nature there is a penalty annexed,
</p>
<p>and every infraction of law calls for the enforcement
</p>
<p>of the penalty. A man thrusts his hand into the fire:
</p>
<p>the natural and lawful result is, he gets his hand burnt.
</p>
<p>Why did he not trust to Providence, and thus prevent
</p>
<p>his hand from being burnt? A man drinks and eats
</p>
<p>to excess: why does he not trust to Providence to prevent drunkenness and sickness, the natural effects of
</p>
<p>intemperance? A man on the top of a lofty steeple
</p>
<p>says,' I'll jump down, and trust to Providence to keep
</p>
<p>my neck from being broken by the leap:' what assurance has he that Providence will save him from
</p>
<p>danger and death? - None whatever.
</p>
<p>"Eve, when she violated the law of God, might
</p>
<p>have said,'I'll trust to Providence.' But what was the

<p>result? -Death. The children of Israel determined to
</p>
<p>THE SOUTHI SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>179
</p>
<p>rid themselves of theocracy, and demanded a king, and
</p>
<p>God permitted them to have a king; and the subsequent results are known to all Biblical students.
</p>
<p>" Providence permitted our ancestors to emigrate to
</p>
<p>this delightful country; and when the yoke of British
</p>
<p>tyranny was laid upon their necks, Providence permitted them to throw it off and to establish a republican
</p>
<p>form of government. Providence has permitted fanatics to spring up by thousands, and traitors by
</p>
<p>hundreds, who are now constantly and earnestly endeavoring to overturn this glorious republic. And
</p>
<p>while they are engaged in this work of national ruin,
</p>
<p>the effects of which will be, if accomplished, the annihilation of our political and religious liberties, national
</p>
<p>and individual bankruptcy, war, pestilence, famine, and
</p>
<p>death, still there are those who constantly say,'Well,
</p>
<p>we must trust to Providence: Providence will overrule
</p>
<p>all- for the best.'
</p>
<p>"' We say, let the people trust to their own good
</p>
<p>sense in this crisis, and go to work like men and patriots,.
</p>
<p>relying on the mercy and power of God, discarding
</p>
<p>ambitious, unprincipled politicians, and all may yet be
</p>
<p>saved. If, however, the people yield their destinies
</p>
<p>into the hands of these political harpies, their ruin is
</p>
<p>inevitable. God may permit the overthrow of our
</p>
<p>Government, and the whole country to be drenched in
</p>
<p>blood, and the yoke of military despotism to be placed
</p>
<p>on our necks; but when the work of ruin is accomplished, it will be horrid blasphemy to say,'Providence
</p>
<p>overruled all for the best.' This would be an infamous
</p>
<p>libel on Providence.

</p>
<p>and the Roman hierarchy to sweep, like a desolating

<p>the blind, both shall fall into the ditch' together. It is

<p>folly for men to say they trust in God and rely on

<p>Providence to overrule all things for the best, when

<p>they neglect to do their duty.

<p>" Providence would permit our present Legislature to
</p>
<p>remain in session until the expenses would bankrupt the
</p>
<p>whole State of Virginia, unless they should eat and

<p>drink themselves to death. Providence permits oratorical demagogues to fire up and turn the hearts and
</p>
<p>heads of the people of one section against the people
</p>
<p>of another section of our country; to spend millions
</p>
<p>of money for munitions of war; to go to fighting, and

<p>kill one another like wild beasts of the forest. All
</p>
<p>these things Providence permits, but does not will.

<p>Its destiny is with them. We believe that the hearts

<p>but their heads are turned wrong by corrupt politicians. Some of these country-destroying demagogues have their eye on the Presidential chair, others

<p>Stripes! down with the infernal Star-Spangled Banner!' O God, have mercy upon us!"
</p>
<p>"FIGHTING IN THE UNION,
</p>
<p>" By fighting in the Union we simply mean revolution. If at any time a Government becomes oppressive,
</p>
<p>and one part of the people, whether a majority or a
</p>
<p>minority, fail to obtain their constitutional rights, it
</p>
<p>then becomes their duty to:throw off the yoke of oppression by revolution. The Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States belongs equally to each and every one of these
</p>
<p>several States, and guarantees equal rights to all.
</p>
<p>"The'Stars and Stripes' are the guarantee to every
</p>
<p>citizen for the protection of his person, property, and
</p>
<p>reputation: if, therefore, any portion of the people of
</p>
<p>these United States shall attempt to deprive any other
</p>
<p>portion of the people of these States of their constitutional rights, the oppressed are justifiable in repelling
</p>
<p>any and all such aggressions at the point of the sword
</p>
<p>and bayonet, if they cannot otherwise obtain redress.
</p>
<p>"If, therefore, as is said, the people of the North
</p>
<p>have oppressed and made aggressions on the rights of
</p>
<p>the people of the South, it becomes the duty of the
</p>
<p>people of the South to state their grievances to the
</p>
<p>people of the North and demand their rights, and, if
</p>
<p>they fail to obtain them peaceably, then commence
</p>
<p>revolution, and by force of arms obtain their rights,
</p>
<p>and repel, put down, and crush out the lawless and

</p>
<p>" The purpose of the Legislature was, and is, to continue in session during the session of the convention,
</p>
<p>and bring all their outside pressure to bear on the convention, to force that body to pass an ordinance of
</p>
<p>secession. Time is rolling on, and will drift the present
</p>
<p>politicians of the day into the shades of peaceful
</p>
<p>retirement, where they'll live unknown and forgotten

<p>and die unlamented. The people should begin to think

<p>and to act for themselves. Politicians are looking after
</p>
<p>their own interests, not caring a farthing for the interests of the people, and, unless the people look to their

</p>
<p>that if the simple question, convention or no convention,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of deciding whether Virginia should secede or not, had been presented, the people of the State
</p>
<p>would have ignored a convention by at least sixty
</p>
<p>thousand majority. They usurped the power, assumed
</p>
<p>the heavy and terrible responsibility, and called the
</p>
<p>convention,-thus placing upon the necks of the dear
</p>
<p>people the iron heel of usurped legislative despotism,
</p>
<p>involving the State in debt, and forcing her out of the
</p>
<p>Union, and thus securing the downfall and utter ruin
</p>
<p>of Virginia. The unmitigated curses of Virginians
</p>
<p>and of the whole country will, in all coming time, be
</p>
<p>heaped upon the nest of legislative traitors who, in the
</p>
<p>winter and spring of 1861, forced Virginia out of the
</p>
<p>Union, and effected her final and eternal ruin, so far as
</p>
<p>the happiness and well-being of the then population
</p>
<p>of the State and of their children are concerned.
</p>
<p>They were a set of unprincipled, ambitious, aspiring
</p>
<p>usurpers of the rights of the people, violators of the

<p>Constitution of the State of Virginia, and perjured
</p>
<p>scoundrels against the Government of the United

<p>of the United States, when, in fact, they went there
</p>
<p>with but one object in view, and that was to break up
</p>
<p>the Government, as their whole course of action and
</p>
<p>the results of their actions have subsequently proved.
</p>
<p>They were rebels, traitors to God, to the people of
</p>
<p>Virginia, to Virginia herself, to the Constitution and
</p>
<p>Government of the United States, and to the whole
</p>
<p>country. We saw plainly what they were doing, and

<p>what they had determined to do, and, therefore, we

</p>
<p>warned the people of Virginia against them. They

<p>ought not only to' have been called home, but tried and

<p>punished for treason after getting home. All these
</p>
<p>things, however, may be warnings to others in ages to

<p>come, and in this way be productive of good.
</p>
<p>The reader will not be surprised when we inform
</p>
<p>him that our patronage was constantly diminishing,
</p>
<p>and we saw plainly that we should be forced to discontinue the publication of our paper. We had a large
</p>
<p>amount of money due us; but this was scattered all
</p>
<p>over the Southern States, and men, for the most part,
</p>
<p>had declined paying us, as money-matters had become
</p>
<p>exceedingly stringent in Virginia, and the stay-law was
</p>
<p>producing its desired effect, and times were looking
</p>
<p>squally ahead. We received many very discouraging
</p>
<p>letters, containing threats and making insinuations
</p>
<p>which, sustaining the relation we did to our churches,all of which were in the slave States,-tended to disturb
</p>
<p>what little of peace and happiness we might otherwise have enjoyed. The " Banner" had already become
</p>
<p>offensive to some even who were members of our
</p>
<p>churches, in consequence of the decided stand we had
</p>
<p>taken for the Union and against secession.
</p>
<p>All the personal ties and interests we had on earth
</p>
<p>were in the slave States, and most of them south of
</p>
<p>the Potomac River. In looking into the terribly awful
</p>
<p>future, we saw nothing but sorrow, tribulation, privation, and distress before us. The distress of mind and
</p>
<p>deep anguish of heart which we suffered, none but God
</p>
<p>could know.

<p>reconciled to man must be proclaimed by men to men.
</p>
<p>Hence says the Apostle Paul,'For when we were yet
</p>
<p>without strength, in due time Christ died for the
</p>
<p>ungodly; for scarcely for a righteous [a legally just]
</p>
<p>man will one die; yet peradventure [perhaps] for a
</p>
<p>good [benevolent] man some would even dare to die;
</p>
<p>but God commendeth his love to us, in that, while we
</p>
<p>were yet sinners, Christ died for us. For if when we
</p>
<p>were enemies we were reconciled to God by the
</p>
<p>death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we
</p>
<p>shall be saved by his life.'
</p>
<p>" The manifestation of the Father's love is the cause
</p>
<p>of the sinner's reconciliation to God. Saint Paul says,' All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry
</p>
<p>of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ
</p>
<p>reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
</p>
<p>trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the
</p>
<p>word of reconciliation.'
</p>
<p>"From this it will be observed that God is reconciled to man; but the difficulty is in getting sinners to

<p>become reconciled to God.
</p>
<p>188
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>"Hence continues the same apostle,'Now, then,
</p>
<p>we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
</p>
<p>reconciled to God.'
</p>
<p>"Is not this plain? Could Heaven make it more
</p>
<p>so? God unconditionally loved the world. He developed that love by unconditionally sending his Son into
</p>
<p>the world to die for all men. Christ developed his own
</p>
<p>love, in that he died unconditionally for all men.
</p>
<p>Christ died a voluntary death:-' Therefore doth my
</p>
<p>Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I
</p>
<p>might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but
</p>
<p>I lay it down of myself; I have power to lay it down,
</p>
<p>and I have power to take it again.'
</p>
<p>" Christ died a vicarious death. He, the innocent, holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
</p>
<p>sinners, died in the stead of sinners, that they might
</p>
<p>live.'For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the
</p>
<p>just for [or in the stead] of the unjust, that he might
</p>
<p>bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
</p>
<p>quickened by the Spirit.' The two great gospel facts
</p>
<p>are these: First, Christ died for our sins, according
</p>
<p>to the old Jewish Scriptures: secondly, he rose again
</p>
<p>from the dead, according to the Jewish Scriptures.
</p>
<p>This is the pith of the glad tidings sent down from
</p>
<p>heaven to earth,-from God to man,-to all men. So
</p>
<p>says the Apostle Paul in his first letter to the Corinthian church:"'Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
</p>
<p>which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which [gospel] also
</p>
<p>ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached

</p>
<p>how that Christ died for our sins, according to the
</p>
<p>Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose
</p>
<p>again the third day, according to the Scriptures.'
</p>
<p>"This was the apostle's theme at all times, in all
</p>
<p>places, and under all circumstances: 'For I determined,' says he,'not to know any thing among you,
</p>
<p>save Jesus Christ and him crucified.'
</p>
<p>"After his conversion, Paul preached in the synagogues
</p>
<p>of the Jews, and declared that Christ was the Son of
</p>
<p>God. In the midst of infuriate mobs, in the councils
</p>
<p>of the Jews,-at the tribunals of governors and kings,he boldly preached Christ and the resurrection, basing
</p>
<p>the truth and certainty of the resurrection of all men
</p>
<p>from the dead upon the fact that Christ rose from the
</p>
<p>dead.'But if there be no resurrection of the dead,
</p>
<p>then is Christ not risen; and if Christ be not risen,
</p>
<p>then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
</p>
<p>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because
</p>
<p>we have testified of God that he raised up Christ, whom
</p>
<p>he raised not up, if the dead rise not.'

<p>these learned doctors of divinity, who are itinerating

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>"REV. DR. GEORGE W. CARTER'S GREAT SPEECH AT
</p>
<p>PH(ENIX HALL.
</p>
<p>"Dr. Carter proceeded to state and vindicate the
</p>
<p>views and policy of those who held that the true
</p>
<p>remedy for their troubles was in secession. He argued
</p>
<p>that secession was exrpedient,-rendered so by the unfriendly purposes of the Northern people, their seizure
</p>
<p>of power over us, their deep, radical difference in
</p>
<p>moral sentiment, which rendered concord hopeless and
</p>
<p>made them the abiding foes of our forms of social
</p>
<p>organization. [Applause]. Secession, so far from being
</p>
<p>a destructive process, was eminently conservative in
</p>
<p>its effects. He used the term conservative in its political-not in its party-sense. In Texas, his country,
</p>
<p>when a man had neither the wit to perceive nor the
</p>
<p>courage to maintain his rights, he generally fell back
</p>
<p>on that last refuge of imbecility, and called himself'a conservative.' Secession was conservative in the
</p>
<p>true sense. It preserved our rights and institutions
</p>
<p>by rejecting the control that sought to destroy them.
</p>
<p>[Great applause].
</p>
<p>"'Our Government,' continued the speaker,'had left
</p>
<p>local interests to local management, and intrusted only
</p>
<p>the common interests to common management. This
</p>
<p>was its grand idea, its inspiration. This, however,
</p>
<p>the Northern people do not seem to understand. They
</p>
<p>seek to regulate our local institutions according to their
</p>
<p>ideas,-to put the order of things as established among
</p>
<p>us "in a course of extinction," and to malke our four
</p>
<p>millions of negroes the equals of the white man. The
</p>
<p>end at which they aim would ruin us. The means by

</p>
<p>ernment. We can submit to neither. Secession is
</p>
<p>absolutely necessary, both to secure our rights, and to
</p>
<p>maintain the local authority which is their guarantee.'"
</p>
<p>"Take the following as a specimen of the reverend
</p>
<p>doctor's logic, by which he arrives at the culminatingpoint,-secession.-Editor Christian Banner.
</p>
<p>"The close of the lengthy and able address of Dr.
</p>
<p>Carter was fired with frequent bursts of fervid eloquence. He earnestly appealed to Virginians to rally
</p>
<p>at once to the side of their brethren of the South, and
</p>
<p>assist them in laying the foundation of an empire which
</p>
<p>held out such unexampled promise of prosperity and
</p>
<p>happiness.'The Southern people,' said he,'are your
</p>
<p>children,-bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh,your descendants. They love you, long for you, wait
</p>
<p>for you, desire you as their leader. They know you
</p>
<p>will come and must come; but, they are anxious for
</p>
<p>you to come immediately. For themselves, their course
</p>
<p>is taken. With you, or without you, they will maintain their position. They are able to do it, and, by the
</p>
<p>blessing of God, they will do it.' [Tremendous applause.]
</p>
<p>"'Some of you,' said the speaker,'talk of "fighting
</p>
<p>in the Union."' He scarcely knew which to admire
</p>
<p>most, the wisdom or the pluck of such a position.
</p>
<p>For one, he could fight on no such platform. In the
</p>
<p>first place, we did not desire to whip the North. If
</p>
<p>the South conquered them, they would not know what
</p>
<p>to do with them. Like the buffalo calf, after they were
</p>
<p>caught they could not be held. [Great laughter.] If
</p>
<p>he could choose to receive a halter on his neck before

<p>he would demand his rights, he would then claim the

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>poor privilege of sealing his lips and bowing without
</p>
<p>murmur or resistance to the yoke.
</p>
<p>"The speaker would say in all kindness to these gentlemen, that, when they thus talked about'fighting,'
</p>
<p>they were mistaken. They were not going to fight.
</p>
<p>They might think they would, but they wouldn't. The
</p>
<p>anecdote related by the English satirist was peculiarly
</p>
<p>illustrative of the class of Unionists to which the
</p>
<p>speaker had just referred. The henpecked husband
</p>
<p>was ordered under the bed. On one occasion a large
</p>
<p>number of the neighboring dames had congregated, as
</p>
<p>usual, to gossip. The poor husband, becoming somewhat excited, peeped out. His wife gave him a significant look, and he withdrew his head. The gossip
</p>
<p>becoming more and more exciting, the poor husband
</p>
<p>again protruded his head. The wife again shook her
</p>
<p>finger, but it did not have the desired effect. Becoming
</p>
<p>enraged, she seized a broomstick and proceeded to force
</p>
<p>back the objectionable head. The courageous husband
</p>
<p>succumbed, and again tucked his head under the bed,
</p>
<p>but protested his courage by declaring that so long as
</p>
<p>he had the spirit of a man he would peep. [Immoderate laughter.]'So,' said the speaker,' with those who
</p>
<p>will fight in the Union. Mr. Lincoln is reinforcing
</p>
<p>your forts, filling your post-offices with men of his own
</p>
<p>selection, and gradually binding you hand and foot.
</p>
<p>By-and-by he will get you under the Black Republican bed. You may then desire to peep out; but Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln will beat you back with the Federal broomstick.' [Renewed laughter.]
</p>
<p>"The speaker had prepared himself for this great work
</p>
<p>amid much trial and trouble. He had prayed on his

</p>
<p>193
</p>
<p>that it was hopelessly and irretrievably gone, he resolved to do his duty to God and his country."
</p>
<p>"Contrast the call of Dr. Carter to itinerate to preach
</p>
<p>secessionism, with the call of Saul to preach the gospel
</p>
<p>of Jesus Christ. Here's the call, as related by the doctor,
</p>
<p>and reported by the'Petersburg Express.' cEditor of
</p>
<p>the Christian 2Banner.
</p>
<p>"An affecting incident was related. One day, while
</p>
<p>in sad meditation, by his own fireside, upon the condition of the country, and the propriety of addressing his
</p>
<p>fellow-citizens on these great questions, at their earnest
</p>
<p>solicitations, his wife observed his sadness, and bade
</p>
<p>him go forward and never mind what the world said.'I will pray for you,' she added. His little boy of
</p>
<p>eight years, who must have obtained his knowledge of
</p>
<p>public affairs from the papers, said,'Pa, if all the South
</p>
<p>will go out, I don't think we'll have a fight; but I
</p>
<p>think we had better go, fight or no fight.' And then
</p>
<p>his little daughter, still younger than her brother,-his
</p>
<p>own dear little Daisy, who was as gentle as the flower
</p>
<p>from which she derived her name,-said,'Yes, pa; you
</p>
<p>and Mr. W. [a member of the family] can help to
</p>
<p>fight, and God and brother Jimmy will take care of
</p>
<p>me.''The man would be worse than craven,' said the
</p>
<p>speaker,'who, under such circumstances, could fail in
</p>
<p>his duty to his family and his country.' [Tremendous
</p>
<p>applause.]"

</p>
<p>"This was a powerful call.'His wife bade him go
</p>
<p>forward and never mind what the world said.'' I will
</p>
<p>pray for you,' she added. He receives his commission
</p>
<p>from his wife, who promises him her prayers for his
</p>
<p>success in breaking up the Government and in destroying
</p>
<p>the country. His little boy of eight years says,'Pa,
</p>
<p>if all the South will go out, I don't think we'll have a
</p>
<p>fight; but I think we had better go, fight or no fight.'
</p>
<p>An intelligent,'spunky' little boy, that!. And then his
</p>
<p>little daughter, still younger than her brother, said,'Yes, pa; you and Mr. W. can help to fight, and God
</p>
<p>and brother Jimmy will take care of me.' Surely'his
</p>
<p>own dear little Daisy, who was as gentle as the flower
</p>
<p>from which she derived her name,' would be safe in the
</p>
<p>hands of God, with little Jimmy, eight years old, to
</p>
<p>help him take care of her. Intelligent little Daisy!
</p>
<p>Worthy to be taken care of!
</p>
<p>"Who could resist such a call as this to go forth
</p>
<p>into all the world and preach secession to every creature? He that believes secession and runs shall be
</p>
<p>saved; but he who stays at home and defends his rights,
</p>
<p>bravely meeting the foe and driving him back, shall
</p>
<p>be beaten with the broomstick or be damned. Mray
</p>
<p>Heaven preserve us! The whole'affecting incident'
</p>
<p>well befitted the speaker, the subject, and the occasion.
</p>
<p>If secession and Abolition doctors of divinity meet
</p>
<p>together in the next world, they'll either kick up a row
</p>
<p>and secede, or else get kicked out themselves. Alas for

<p>Christianity! Alas for the Bible! Alas for the

</p>
<p>ANNOTATIONS ON THE ABOVE CHAPTER.
</p>
<p>D)octors of Divinity.-Of these titled divines, George
</p>
<p>W. Carter is a doctor of Southern Methodist divinity,
</p>
<p>as well as of Southern Methodist treason. That he has
</p>
<p>acted well his part in effecting the eternal and temporal
</p>
<p>destruction of his fellow-men to the full extent of his
</p>
<p>influence and abilities, we doubt not. The evidences
</p>
<p>before us are full and direct to the point.
</p>
<p>Does he not profess, according to the discipline of his
</p>
<p>Church, to be "called and sent of God to preach," and
</p>
<p>to be "anointed with the unction of the Holy Ghost,"
</p>
<p>to enable him faithfully to perform the work of an
</p>
<p>evangelical minister of the gospel of the Lord Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ? To resist his authority and teaching, therefore, is to virtually resist the authority of God and the
</p>
<p>teachings of the Holy Ghost. If this be not a fair deduction from the premises assumed by the reverend
</p>
<p>gentleman, that he is "called and sent of God to
</p>
<p>preach," then he comes before the people with a lie in
</p>
<p>his mouth, saying that he is called of God to preach,
</p>
<p>when God has not called him to any such work, and
</p>
<p>that he is anointed of the Holy Ghost, when the Holy
</p>
<p>Ghost has had nothing to do with him more than with
</p>
<p>other hardened reprobates.
</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, however, let us suppose
</p>
<p>that God has "called and sent him to preach." To
</p>
<p>preach what? To preach the disruption and downfall
</p>
<p>of the greatest, happiest, and most prosperous nation
</p>
<p>on the earth, and the overthrow of the purest and best

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>To preach the inauguration of civil war, death to untold thousands, and all the afflictions, sorrows, and
</p>
<p>woes that earth can inflict upon thirty millions of undying souls. To preach secession, the disintegration of
</p>
<p>the American Republic, the annihilation of liberty and
</p>
<p>all the blessings of freedom, as absolutely necessary to
</p>
<p>secure the rights and perpetuity of our local institzutions,-that is, the perpetual bondage of our four millions of negroes, and their future increase forever. To
</p>
<p>preach persecution, imprisonment, proscription, and
</p>
<p>death by hanging, and all the terrors of a Southern
</p>
<p>Methodist orthodox hell, to all Union men, submissionists, and Abolitionists. To preach and send true
</p>
<p>patriots and loyal citizens to perdition, by tapping
</p>
<p>them on the head with an old woman's broomstick, because they won't wheel into the line of divinity traitors
</p>
<p>and be baptized in the pool of Southern treason. To
</p>
<p>preach, at all times, in all places, under all circumstances, and at every hazard, the perpetual bondage of
</p>
<p>African slavery. In a word, God has "called and sent,"
</p>
<p>and the "Holy Ghost has anointed," these reverend
</p>
<p>divines to preach negroism first, negroismn last, and
</p>
<p>NEGROISM forever! This is the work and the character
</p>
<p>of preaching in which these Southern Methodist doctors
</p>
<p>of divinity have been engaged for the last twenty-five
</p>
<p>or thirty years at least.
</p>
<p>What gave rise to the severance of the Methodist
</p>
<p>Episcopal Church in the city of New York in 1844,
</p>
<p>which was the entering wedge to the disruption of the
</p>
<p>Federal Union? Negroism! What was the popular

<p>stumping the State of Virginia in 1849,'50,'51, &c.,
</p>
<p>when all the divine eloquence of their souls was thrown
</p>
<p>into the subject, and they were delivering speeches
</p>
<p>nine hours long,-as in the case of Mr. Rosser,-to fire
</p>
<p>up the Southern heart, and stir up vindictive feelings
</p>
<p>against the people of the North? ATegroisn! The
</p>
<p>Southern Methodist pulpit has been prostituted for the
</p>
<p>last twenty or thirty years by the preaching of negroism to the people, instead of preaching the gospel
</p>
<p>of the Lord Jesus Christ,-peace on earth, and good
</p>
<p>will toward all men! These doctors of divinity, and
</p>
<p>their little, inflated understrappers, have performed
</p>
<p>their full share of treasonable work in breaking
</p>
<p>up the Government of these United States. "The
</p>
<p>Methodist Episcopal Church, South," was based upon
</p>
<p>negroism; and it was this circumstance, more than
</p>
<p>all others combined, that gained it popularity in the
</p>
<p>South. The Southern clergy pandered to the cupidity,
</p>
<p>pride, and vanity of slave-holders, because they
</p>
<p>wanted their salaries, parsonages, sectarian schools,
</p>
<p>academies, colleges, fine meeting-houses, &c., for all of
</p>
<p>which they were dependent, to a very great extent, on
</p>
<p>large slave-holders, cotton and tobacco, rice and sugar
</p>
<p>planters, &c. Eternity alone can develop the incalculable amount of mischief the Southern pulpit has effected
</p>
<p>towards introducing the cruel war which is now raging
</p>
<p>among the American people. The withering and blighting influence of their teachings and preaching was felt
</p>
<p>in all States, counties, cities, towns, villages, neighborhoods, communities, and families in the whole South.

<p>The clergy were everywhere, and among all classes,

<p>gentleman remain in Texas, his own country? Because " his wife bade him go forward" into Old Virginia and preach secession to every creature. Virginia
</p>
<p>was slow to understand, and hard to believe, all that
</p>
<p>was promised by secession orators and written by
</p>
<p>secession editors, and her delay was about to prove
</p>
<p>ruinous to the cause of the Southern Confederacy, and,
</p>
<p>to urge her to take the suicidal step, the learned Dr.
</p>
<p>Carter came on a holy mission from Texas, his own
</p>
<p>country, to say to Virginia, "The Southern people are
</p>
<p>your -children, ' bone of your bone and flesh of your
</p>
<p>flesh,'-your descendants. They love you, long for
</p>
<p>you, wait for you, desire you as their leader. They
</p>
<p>know you will come, and must come, but they are
</p>
<p>anxious for you to come immediately." He visited
</p>
<p>Petersburg, Richmond, Alexandria, Lynchburg, &c.;
</p>
<p>and everywhere the great burden of his important
</p>
<p>mission was, Virginia will come, must come, but we
</p>
<p>"'are anxious" for her "to come immediately." He
</p>
<p>came to strike the death-knell of Old Virginia and all
</p>
<p>her greatness, glory, honor, prosperity, and happiness.
</p>
<p>He came to urge "Virginians to rally at once to the
</p>
<p>side of their brethren of the South, to assist them in
</p>
<p>laying the foundations of an empire which held out
</p>
<p>such unexampled promise of prosperity and happiness."
</p>
<p>He came, however, in fact, to robe " Virginians" in their
</p>
<p>winding-sheets, and leave them on the battle-fields to
</p>
<p>slumber until God shall bid them rise. Can the doctor,
</p>
<p>with all his "fervid eloquence," undo the awful work

<p>"fervid eloquence," to their parents, wives, and children,
</p>
<p>the thousands of sleeping dead who lie on the battlefields at Yorktown, Williamsburg, Richmond, Manassas,
</p>
<p>Cedar Mountain?-in a word, the unknown thousands
</p>
<p>who have fallen in battle and now lie sleeping in death
</p>
<p>on Virginia's sacred soil? Can he soothe and bind up
</p>
<p>the aching hearts of aged fathers and mothers, of sorrowing widows and suffering children? What word of

<p>consolation could he whisper in their ears? Would he
</p>
<p>tell them he came from " Texas, his country," to argue
</p>
<p>that secession was expedient, that secession was conservative,-that "secession was absolutely necessary
</p>
<p>to secure our rights" and to enable us to hold on to
</p>
<p>our four millions of negroes? Great God! reader,
</p>
<p>look at the picture. Think of the man,-this learned
</p>
<p>doctor of divinity,-who was evidently either a fool
</p>
<p>or a knave,-and then think that there were thousands
</p>
<p>on thousands all over the South, of the same clerical
</p>
<p>and doctor-of-divinity order, who were engaged in the
</p>
<p>same hellish work of dissolving the Union and preciptating the country into revolution and civil war.
</p>
<p>To say that God Almighty ever called and sent such

<p>fools or knaves-for either the one or the other they
</p>
<p>must be-to preach the gospel of his Son Jesus Christ,
</p>
<p>is a libel on the wisdom, goodness, justice, and character of Jehovah; and none but fools can believe it.
</p>
<p>And here we must be allowed to say-and we say it
</p>
<p>because we know it to be true-that the clergy of the
</p>
<p>Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the clergy of
</p>
<p>the South generally, are worldly-minded, money-loving,

<p>money-making, and money-saving men, hard masters,

<p>"Our four millions of negroes."-The reader cannot
</p>
<p>fail to observe that to fasten the chains of perpetual
</p>
<p>bondage on "our four millions of negroes" and their
</p>
<p>future increase was paramount to any and all other
</p>
<p>considerations with Dr. Carter and with the whole fraternal band of leading conspirators of the South. Let

<p>our sons be butchered upon the battle-field; let ten

</p>
<p>the dying, and the dead; but let us hold on to "our

<p>let one long, loud, universal cry of sorrow, lamentation,

<p>and woe go up to heaven; but let us hold on to " our four

<p>201
</p>
<p>unexampled promise of prosperity and happiness." Oh,
</p>
<p>the trickery, the villany, the deep, black, damnable rascality, that was employed to coax, swindle, and force
</p>
<p>Virginia out of the Union, and to consequent ruin, by
</p>
<p>these clerical demons and wicked, aspiring politicians!
</p>
<p>Let them come and take a wide survey of Virginia's
</p>
<p>greatness, prosperity, and happiness now, and say if her
</p>
<p>leadership is enviable! Ay, reader, " beneath the folds
</p>
<p>of the white robes of the Church lie hid the keys of
</p>
<p>empire and an iron sceptre."
</p>
<p>"Tucked his head under the bed."-This, reader, is a
</p>
<p>specimen of the ridiculous stories and anecdotes that
</p>
<p>were constantly narrated in the public speeches of these
</p>
<p>clerical and political secesh orators, to stir up and excite
</p>
<p>the baser passions of their audiences to vindictiveness
</p>
<p>against the whole people of the North. We speak what
</p>
<p>we do know, and testify what we have seen and heard.
</p>
<p>"Affecting incident."-Without questioning the truth
</p>
<p>of the affecting incident as narrated by the learned
</p>
<p>doctor, was it not a shameful reason to urge upon an
</p>
<p>intelligent audience, that a " man would be worse than
</p>
<p>craven who, under such circumstances, could fail in his
</p>
<p>duty to his family and his country"? That is to say,
</p>
<p>who would fail in his duty to introduce sorrow, affliction, hunger, nakedness, famine, and death into his

<p>family, by disrupting his country and precipitating revolution and civil war, with all their accompanying train

<p>to fight, and God and brother Jimmy will take care of
</p>
<p>me!" Precocious infants these! There's the story,
</p>
<p>reader: you can think of it as you please. But why
</p>
<p>was the story told by the doctor? To stir up the
</p>
<p>sympathies of his hearers, and to enlist the feelings'
</p>
<p>of men, women and children, old men and old women,
</p>
<p>little boys and girls, to influence them to raise the clamor and force Virginia out of the Union. Surely the
</p>
<p>doctor must have thought that he was at a Southern
</p>
<p>Methodist revival, as such stories are generally employed on those occasions to force people to the
</p>
<p>" mourners' bench, to get religion!" Such, intelligent
</p>
<p>reader, were the means to which these Southern oratorical traitors resorted to stir up the vile passions and
</p>
<p>tender sympathies of all classes to influence them to
</p>
<p>force Virginia out of the Union.
</p>
<p>We have extended our remarks and entered thus
</p>
<p>largely into the details of the "Great Speech of the
</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. George W. Carter" and the circumstances
</p>
<p>connected with it, not because it is an isolated case,
</p>
<p>but as a tolerably fair specimen of the trickery used by
</p>
<p>the Southern secesh clergy generally, and by political
</p>
<p>secesh orators, to precipitate Virginia into secession
</p>
<p>and ultimate ruin. How effectually they succeeded in
</p>
<p>their work of destruction her subsequent history will
</p>
<p>show.
</p>
<p>In connection with this subject, we will just state
</p>
<p>that one of the strongest reasons why the females of
</p>
<p>the South were, and still are, so bitter and vindictive in
</p>
<p>their feelings towards the "old Union," the "Stars and
</p>
<p>Stripes," and Union men generally, and the Union men
</p>
<p>of the South particularly, is owing to the great influence

<p>gued that secession must be right, "because the women

<p>them that they believed it was right. And it would

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIV.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of March
</p>
<p>28, 1861, we wrote and published the following:-,,SIGNS OF THE GREAT UPHEAVING IN THE SECEDED
</p>
<p>STATES.
</p>
<p>"When a boy, we witnessed the great Nullification excitement, as it was called, in the State of South
</p>
<p>Carolina. Then there were Nullifiers and Unionists,
</p>
<p>and the contention was as hot between those two parties as has ever been the contention between the North
</p>
<p>and South. And we now believe that, if the question had then been left to the vote of thepeople, a large
</p>
<p>majority would have been for the Union. Knowing
</p>
<p>this to have been the case, we have all the time had
</p>
<p>our doubts as to whether the people generally in the
</p>
<p>seceded States went understandingly and heartily into
</p>
<p>the act of secession.
</p>
<p>" Had it even been left to the vote of the people, how

</p>
<p>five or six weeks on subjects which many reading men
</p>
<p>do not profess to understand? This seems to have
</p>
<p>been taken for granted by the leaders: hence they
</p>
<p>ignored the intelligence, will, action, voice, and power
</p>
<p>of the people. And just look at it.
</p>
<p>" The people of the Southern Confederacy, thus being
</p>
<p>ignored by their leaders, are now to be regarded as
</p>
<p>traitors and submissionists, and to be trodden down
</p>
<p>and crushed out, if they enter a disclaimer against the
</p>
<p>usurpation of power exercised by their leaders.
</p>
<p>"A reaction is bound to take place as soon as the
</p>
<p>people fully understand the political trap in which they
</p>
<p>have been caught. A free and independent people do
</p>
<p>not like to be led as sheep to the slaughter; and, when
</p>
<p>they once understand the trick which has been imposed
</p>
<p>upon them, and begin to feel the burden unconditionally placed on their shoulders, there will be a groundswell that will astonish the leaders in this fearful
</p>
<p>drama, and a revolution which we fear will be terrible
</p>
<p>in its character. We think it vitally important, therefore, that our readers should understand this subject,
</p>
<p>and understand it well, as our very being depends upon
</p>
<p>its final results. Read, in proof of the truth and correctness of the foregoing remarks, the following extracts
</p>
<p>from Southern newspapers. They speak for themselves. The Tuscumbia'North Alabamian,' in its
</p>
<p>issue of the 22d instant, remarking upon the course of
</p>
<p>Congress at Montgomery, says,"However our people in this section of the State
</p>
<p>may have differed with a majority of the convention
</p>
<p>touching the policy of that majority on the subject of

<p>immediate secession, there should be no division among

</p>
<p>the honor and dignity of Alabama, whether assaulted
</p>
<p>by fanatics North or South.' There has been, however,
</p>
<p>a manifest distrust or disregard of the popular sentiment by the leading politicians of Alabama, in withholding the secession ordinance from a vote of the
</p>
<p>people; and the tendency still is, if we are not mistaken in the movements of the political chess-board of
</p>
<p>those leaders, to remove still further all power from the
</p>
<p>immediate action of the people. What voice had they
</p>
<p>in electing members to the Congress now in session at
</p>
<p>Montgomery? And what voice, kind reader, do you
</p>
<p>think you will have in ratifying the constitution which
</p>
<p>that Congress has adopted? By what authority have
</p>
<p>a President and Vice-President been elected to the Confederate States of America? When you elected your
</p>
<p>members to a State Convention, did you authorize a
</p>
<p>bare majority of that body to elect members to
</p>
<p>a Congress, to form a new Government, and to
</p>
<p>authorize still further the members of that convention to elect a President, a Vice-President, and
</p>
<p>other officials? These are questions for your serious
</p>
<p>consideration."
</p>
<p>The New Orleans "Picayune" complains, in the following strain, of " the exercise by the State Convention
</p>
<p>of a power which has resulted in the assemblage of a
</p>
<p>Congress at Montgomery composed of citizens in whose

<p>election the people -had no direct voice, whose action is
</p>
<p>devoid of any direct responsibility to the people, and
</p>
<p>whose assumed power was unlimited when assembled;
</p>
<p>the imposition by the Congress upon the people of the

</p>
<p>The Tuscaloosa (Alabama) "iMonitor" thus sums up
</p>
<p>its objections to the proceedings of the Alabama
</p>
<p>State Convention and the Southern Congress at Montgomery:"We hold, first, that the ordinance of secession
</p>
<p>should have been submitted to the people for their ratification or rejection. Secondly, that the ordinance
</p>
<p>passed by the convention should have awaited the issue
</p>
<p>of this decision. Thirdly, that the people had the right,
</p>
<p>and it should have been given them, to have chosen the
</p>
<p>delegates to a Congress which was to have framed for
</p>
<p>them a Government for weal or woe. And we now demand that, the Government formed, its President, VicePresident, and officers should be submitted to the
</p>
<p>people for their approval or disapproval. If it is not,
</p>
<p>we shall, come weal or woe, attempt to fire the people's
</p>
<p>heart, to educate the people's mind, to know their rights
</p>
<p>and to dare maintain them. We are no submissionist;
</p>
<p>but right is right, and wrong is wrong, and we will not
</p>
<p>betray our trust. We assert that the people had a right
</p>
<p>to be heard, and, being heard, to be obeyed. And we
</p>
<p>intend to keep them posted in what we consider to be
</p>
<p>an infringement of their rights and of their privileges,
</p>
<p>let the worst come to the worst. If it be treason
</p>
<p>against the new Confederacy, make the most of it. We
</p>
<p>know we are right, and, untrammelled and unawed, we

<p>will defend the right."

<p>"We regret to see a spirit of intolerance manifested
</p>
<p>by a portion of the disunion papers of this State. They
</p>
<p>seem to have arrogated to themselves the office of
</p>
<p>censor. Every thing political that does not conform to
</p>
<p>their ideas of right they denounce as treasonable, and
</p>
<p>seem to insinuate that any thing but their own views
</p>
<p>will not be tolerated in the Southern Confederacy.
</p>
<p>Has the reign of terror begun? Are we in the hands
</p>
<p>of red republicans? If it has come to this, then we

<p>are certainly undone. We are as ready as any man to
</p>
<p>offer up our life, if need be, in defence of the rights
</p>
<p>of the South; and we hold that we are no less true to
</p>
<p>those rights than these Hotspurs when we express our
</p>
<p>love for the old Union of our fathers. If it is treason
</p>
<p>for a citizen of the Southern Confederacy to express
</p>
<p>his dissatisfaction with the present Union, was it not
</p>
<p>equally as great a crime to denounce the old Union?
</p>
<p>Treason has the same definition in the new as it had in
</p>
<p>the old Constitution. We hold ourselves to be loyal to

<p>the Southern Confederacy, and we greatly deprecate

<p>of our Confederacy an endless alternation of imbecile

<p>would be renewed. Our people would be divided, and

</p>
<p>GENERAL REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING CHAPTER.
</p>
<p>We have already stated that we witnessed the great
</p>
<p>Nullification excitement which raged in the State
</p>
<p>of South Carolina in the years 1830-31 and 1832.
</p>
<p>Then there were two great antagonistic parties, the
</p>
<p>Nullifiers and the Unionists, and the contention between them was as violent as had ever been the contention between the North and the South.
</p>
<p>John C. Calhoun was the champion and idol of the
</p>
<p>Nullification party, his followers regarding him as being
</p>
<p>the embodiment of all political orthodoxy; but, notwithstanding his great moral virtues, his immense
</p>
<p>wealth, his high order of intellect, and his superior
</p>
<p>accomplishments, he was unable to convert the whole
</p>

<p>disunion.
</p>
<p>TrHE SOUTH SACRIFICED,
</p>
<p>209
</p>
<p>As we have just stated, there were two vehement
</p>
<p>parties desperately arrayed the one against the other.
</p>
<p>Men quarrelled and fought, women quarrelled and
</p>
<p>fought, boys quarrelled and fought, and mothers with
</p>
<p>infant children who for want of physical strength
</p>
<p>and a knowledge of language were unable to quarrel
</p>
<p>and fight, stuck blue-ribbon cockades on their little
</p>
<p>caps and hats, to let the Unionists know how and what
</p>
<p>they would do if they were only able. Ministers of all
</p>
<p>denominations took sides, and nullification and politics
</p>
<p>supplanted the gospel of Jesus Christ in the pulpits;
</p>
<p>and the same unholy, infuriate, vindictive spirit and
</p>
<p>passions were developed then as were manifested between the secessionists and Union parties at the outburst of the present ungodly rebellion; and to what a
</p>
<p>deplorable extent matters might then have been carried, had it not been for the strong nerve, the moral
</p>
<p>courage, the iron will and whole-souled patriotic spirit
</p>
<p>of General Jackson, God only knows.
</p>
<p>The same spirit of nullification and rebellion which
</p>
<p>was then at work in the hearts of the children of disobedience, and which has been growing, increasing,
</p>
<p>and strengthening ever since, reached the culminatingpoint in December, 1860, in the passage of an ordinance of secession at Charleston, South Carolina, and
</p>
<p>subsequently by an attack being made on the glorious
</p>
<p>"flag" of our country, and the inauguration of civil
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>When, in the month of December, 1860, at Pleasant
</p>
<p>Grove Meeting-House, in Green county, North Carolina, we saw, for the first time since the days of South
</p>
<p>Carolina nullification, a contemptible blue cockade, the

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>ing on the hat of a shallow-headed Breckinridge Democrat, in a moment our mind was carried back to
</p>
<p>the days of blue-ribbon cockades and South Carolina
</p>
<p>nullification; and, looking into the dark mysterious
</p>
<p>future, we trembled as we meditated on the sure and
</p>
<p>certain consequences. Then it was a dark and sad
</p>
<p>picture to contemplate; now we are suffering the stern
</p>
<p>realities.
</p>
<p>Why were the leaders in this rebellion afraid to
</p>
<p>submit the question to the people whether these conventions should be held at all or not? And why were
</p>
<p>they afraid to submit their ordinances of secession to a
</p>
<p>vote of the people of the several States in which they
</p>
<p>were passed? Simply because they feared that the vote
</p>
<p>of the people would thwart their nefarious design to
</p>
<p>overthrow the Government. This is the only legitimate reason that can be given why the will, action,
</p>
<p>and power of the people were ignored by these political
</p>
<p>Jesuits. When these Democratic leaders were before
</p>
<p>the people begging for popular suffrage, they boasted
</p>
<p>that all power was lodged in the people; but as soon as
</p>
<p>the convenient period, the appointed hour, the set time,
</p>
<p>arrived to overthrow the Government which the people
</p>
<p>themselves had created, the stream rose above the
</p>
<p>fountain, and the creature became superior to the creator,
</p>
<p>and all power and authority were wrested from the
</p>
<p>people, and usurped by a set of tyrants for the purpose
</p>
<p>of establishing a despotism over the dear people, and an
</p>
<p>accursed negro-oligarchy on the ruins of liberty and
</p>
<p>the rights of freemen. These are historical facts,
</p>
<p>which, black, infamous, and damning as they are,
</p>
<p>the ever-rolling stream of time will carry down to

<p>save the country! Oh, the beauties, the excellencies,
</p>
<p>the glories, the loveliness of Breckinridge Democracy!
</p>
<p>Reader, it is nothing more nor less than degnonocracy,the power and government of devils! Look at the work
</p>
<p>it has done.
</p>
<p>Ditches and pits have been filled with slaughtered
</p>
<p>men, hills and valleys have been bleached with the
</p>
<p>bones of our dear sons, fathers, brothers, neighbors,
</p>
<p>friends, and fellow-citizens, thousands of hospitals filled
</p>
<p>with the wounded, sick, and dying, loathsome prisons
</p>
<p>and dungeons filled with harmless, worthy, patriotic
</p>
<p>citizens, deprived of all the blessings and comforts of
</p>
<p>home and friends, and made to lie and pine away and
</p>
<p>die, without a friend to administer to their extreme
</p>
<p>wants while living or to drop a tear of love and sympathy over them when dying and dead, and all because
</p>
<p>they loved their country and were suspicioned by traitors.
</p>
<p>It has made manidtcs of thousands of men and women.
</p>
<p>Look, also, at the maimed, the lame, the halt, and the
</p>
<p>blind: thousands of poor soldiers have their arms or
</p>
<p>legs shot off; others, again, have their mouths, noses,
</p>
<p>ears, or eyes shot off or cut up with scimeters, swords,
</p>
<p>or bayonets, and are otherwise disabled and made
</p>
<p>infirm for life. Look at the desolated farms, the
</p>
<p>empty corn and meat houses, the dreary mansions and
</p>
<p>lonely cottages, all over the country, filled only with
</p>
<p>destitute women, weeping widows, and poor little
</p>
<p>orphan children in rags and tatters, starving and
</p>
<p>crying for meat and bread, the very necessaries of
</p>
<p>actual existence, and no hand to extend to them relief.

</p>
<p>children, brothers, friends, and neighbors. Think of

<p>the millions of sorrowful, throbbing, aching hearts,the floods of tears which have flowed. Think of the
</p>
<p>unknown thousands of refugees, driven from their once
</p>
<p>quiet and peaceful homes, thrown among strangers,
</p>
<p>destitute of the means of support, many of them separated from their wives and children, deprived of all the
</p>
<p>blessings and comforts of home, sweet home! In a
</p>
<p>word, think of a whole nation immersed in sorrow and
</p>
<p>woe, and then tell us, reader, that this is not the work

<p>of devils!
</p>
<p>The leaders, fearing to let the people know their infernal design to overthrow the Government, lest they

<p>might be defeated by the popular vote at the ballotbox, usurped the whole power, and have completed the

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the Christian Banner of April 4,
</p>
<p>1861, we wrote and published the following editorials: 
</p>
<p>"Position defined.-A new political move. The
</p>
<p>CAristian's Bible, and the American Constitution.Startling developments.-But there is no Union now.Immediate, absolute, and eternal secession. Iow is
</p>
<p>it?-Important consideration.
</p>
<p>"'Tis somewhat provoking, when one is conscious of
</p>
<p>the honesty and integrity of his own heart and purpose of life, to be misrepresented and slandered as
</p>
<p>being a traitor and an enemy to his country, and
</p>
<p>that, too, by his own familiar friends. Nothing is
</p>
<p>more common now than to hear those men who have
</p>
<p>been true to their country, and have maintained con-sistency throughout the whole political struggle
</p>
<p>through which our country has thus far passed, called,
</p>
<p>by those who please to dissent from them, by the opprobrious epithets of'Abolitionists, submissionists to
</p>
<p>old Abe Lincoln, submissionists to Black -Republican
</p>
<p>rule, the vassals of the tail end of the Northern Confederacy,' &c. &c.
</p>
<p>"Let us impartially examine the facts in the case.
</p>
<p>During the last Presidential canvass there were four
</p>
<p>candidates in the field. The Bell-and-Everett electors
</p>
<p>took for their platform'The Union, the Constitution,
</p>
<p>and enforcement of the laws.' To this platform the

</p>
<p>217
</p>
<p>thought to be sufficiently sound and strong for them to
</p>
<p>stand on; and hence there seemed to be but little or
</p>
<p>no material difference, and certainly no important
</p>
<p>issue, between these two parties, and during the whole
</p>
<p>canvass, for the most part, they stood shoulder to
</p>
<p>shoulder. Each one of these parties accused the
</p>
<p>Breckinridge party of a premeditated design of breaking up the Government in the event of a'defeat. This
</p>
<p>the Breckinridge party denied; and when the ultraismn
</p>
<p>of Newton and Yancey was introduced as evidence, the
</p>
<p>Breckinridge electors maintained that these men were
</p>
<p>not the proper exponents of the party, and that they
</p>
<p>did not reflect the true and correct sentiments of their
</p>
<p>party. All were opposed to the breaking up of the
</p>
<p>Union. The Bell and Douglas parties contended that
</p>
<p>Lincoln's election, would not be sufficient cause for a
</p>
<p>dissolution of the Union. The idea of disunion and
</p>
<p>secession was denounced in the most unqualified terms
</p>
<p>by the Bell and Douglas parties.
</p>
<p>"The election came off, and Lincoln was elected.
</p>
<p>All at once the country is thrown into a state of consternation; business becomes paralyzed, confidence is
</p>
<p>destroyed, general bankruptcy and universal anarchy
</p>
<p>threaten the whole country. What had happened?'Lincoln was elected President!' Well, what of it?
</p>
<p>Why all this national terror, disorder, and confusion
</p>
<p>because of the election of a single man to office?
</p>
<p>What could Lincoln do? Nothing,-positively nothing! The conservative men had the power in both
</p>
<p>houses of Congress, and could have defeated any
</p>
<p>measure which might have been detrimental to the
</p>
<p>interests of the country or of any portion or section
</p>
<p>of the country.

<p>the Representatives from the Gulf States said that
</p>
<p>they felt no interest in the Federal Government, that
</p>
<p>their States were going to secede, and that they were
</p>
<p>only waiting the action of their States. Well, their
</p>
<p>States seceded, and they vacated their seats in Congress, and left the border States and the whole Federal

<p>Government in the hands and at the mercy of their

<p>enemies. The Representatives of the slave States are

<p>now in the minority, and the'Black Republicans' can

<p>the border States full in the face.

<p>secession and disunion, which twelve months ago were

<p>mission, to which we will never willingly yield or

</p>
<p>"That the remedy for the evils which threaten the
</p>
<p>South is to be found in secession and disunion is what
</p>
<p>we do not believe, and what yet remains to be proved.
</p>
<p>Great inducements are held out to us if we will join
</p>
<p>the'Southern Confederacy.' The glories arising from
</p>
<p>the joining of this'new Southern Confederacy' are
</p>
<p>all in the distant future; we know nothing of them,
</p>
<p>and, like Mohammed's heaven of wine and women, they
</p>
<p>exist only in the sickly imaginations of ambitious, disappointed politicians. We doubt whether one of
</p>
<p>Mohammed's followers has ever attained to that heaven
</p>
<p>even unto this day, and we equally doubt whether any

<p>one will ever realize the promised glories of this'new

<p>"All the slave States are interested in the final and
</p>
<p>equitable adjustment of the slavery question. The

<p>border States, however, are much more deeply interested than the Gulf States, because they are and
</p>
<p>always have been the greater sufferers. It became,
</p>
<p>therefore, the duty of all these States jointly to demand such securities and guarantees for the protection
</p>
<p>of their rights as they might wish, or think necessary. This was the duty of all the slave States

<p>jointly. Had this been done, and had their ultimatum been rejected by the North, then, and in that

<p>our book. To run is no part of our programme. We
</p>
<p>don't run from our enemies. We don't submit and
</p>
<p>yield up our rights to our enemies without a manly
</p>
<p>effort to defend them. We are not afraid of President
</p>
<p>Lincoln; and, if we were, we think it would be bad
</p>
<p>policy to let him know it,-especially if he meditate
</p>
<p>harm against us. What! confess we are scared, and

<p>run away even before the battle begins? No! never!

<p>never! A scared man is half whipped, to say the least

<p>of it.

<p>"A desperate effort was made to precipitate civil war,
</p>
<p>and, consequently, to precipitate the border States out
</p>
<p>of the Union. The constant cry was, War! war! war!
</p>
<p>The whole country expected war. War was in the
</p>
<p>minds, in the hearts, in the feelings, in the mouths, and
</p>
<p>on the tongues, of all. In parlors, dining-rooms,
</p>
<p>kitchens, hotels, livery-stables, barber-shops, cars,'steamboats, on the highways, by-ways, in the hedges,
</p>
<p>in pulpits, on rostrums, by day and by night, at home
</p>
<p>and abroad, at all times, in all places, everywhere, and
</p>
<p>under all circumstances, the constant theme was war!

<p>treat it with contempt; but what harm has it ever
</p>
<p>done them? Suppose they should gain the ascendency:
</p>
<p>would it be safe, would it be wise, for Christians,
</p>
<p>although in a minority, to declaim against the Bible,
</p>
<p>and cry,' Down with it! down with it! down with the

<p>accursed book!' simply because infidels are in the

<p>majority? What Christian will say so?

<p>we will dissolve every religious, social, and political

<p>of God's revealed will to man,-that it will direct all
</p>
<p>true believers in the Lord Jesus Christ to the kingdom

<p>appears unnatural, ungrateful, unpatriotic, unchristian,

<p>in fact, still exists, minus, however, seven of its original thirty-three members. It, therefore, becomes the

</p>
<p>who feel for and sympathize with them, to force the unruly and refractory members still remaining in the

<p>off the yoke of oppression, and thus produce revolution
</p>
<p>and civil war among themselves? We think so.
</p>
<p>" This is a question of the gravest importance, and one
</p>
<p>which is worth the serious consideration of all those
</p>
<p>political leaders who are moving heaven and earth in
</p>
<p>order to precipitate Virginia out of the Union. Minorities have rights as well as majorities; and those
</p>
<p>rights should be respected; and if majorities refuse to
</p>
<p>do so, the minorities, as soon as they feel the weight
</p>
<p>of oppression, and find, or believe, that they are able
</p>
<p>to throw off the yoke of tyranny which majorities
</p>
<p>have forced upon their necks, will rise up in rebellion
</p>
<p>and assert and defend their rights.
</p>
<p>"If, therefore, Virginia shall ultimately secede, the
</p>
<p>people of the State should have ample time to consider
</p>
<p>the matter well and thoroughly understand the principles on which they secede, and the reasons why they
</p>
<p>secede, and all act in harmony; otherwise, terrible results may grow out of a too hasty flight out of the
</p>
<p>Union. Recent observations convince us how easy it
</p>
<p>is for a people, led on by ambitious, unprincipled politicians, to repudiate to-day the acts of yesterday, and
</p>
<p>the acts of to-day they will as readily repudiate tomorrow. To-day they will exalt a man to heaven,
</p>
<p>and to-morrow they will doom him to infamy, without being able to assign a justifiable reason for either
</p>
<p>act. The work of breaking up and overturning one
</p>
<p>system of government to establish another, for the express purpose of accommodating and installing politicians in office, is a serious business. The results will

<p>be fearful,-the consequences terrible. Remember what

<p>Tlais the country was kept in a state of continual

</p>
<p>would commence the war before President Lincoln,

<p>and thus save him the trouble, and the Government

<p>the mortification, of inaugurating civil war. In this

<p>we were not deceived.

</p>
<p>United States, and the State Senate. Virginia had not
</p>
<p>seceded, and yet these candidates said that if they were
</p>
<p>elected, they would serve in either Congress; that if
</p>
<p>Virginia seceded and joined the Southern Confederacy,
</p>
<p>they would serve in the Southern Congress, but, if
</p>
<p>Virginia did not secede, they would serve in the Congress of the United States.
</p>
<p>Ex-Governor Smith had announced himself a candidate for re-election to Congress, at Spottsylvania CourtHouse, on the first Monday in April, and was on an
</p>
<p>electioneering tour through the district at the time we
</p>
<p>wrote the following brief paragraph, which appeared
</p>
<p>in the number of the "Christian Banner" of April
</p>
<p>4, 1861:"Ex-Governor Smith is a candidate for re-election to
</p>
<p>Congress; and as the'Virginia (Alexandria) Sentinel' and
</p>
<p>the'Virginia (Fredericksburg) Herald' have buried the
</p>
<p>political tomahawk, and now stand shoulder to shoulder
</p>
<p>on the rickety platform of immediate secession, ExGovernor Smith will, as a matter of course, receive the
</p>
<p>hearty and cordial support of both these journals; and
</p>
<p>it may, therefore, be reasonably inferred that his election is sure. Well may it be said that'Extra Billy is
</p>
<p>hard to beat.'"
</p>
<p>Governor Smith had no opponent more violent in his
</p>
<p>whole district than the'Virginia Herald,' up to the
</p>
<p>time that that journal turned over to Breckirtridge locofoco treason,-and no friend more devoted to his political interest than the'Virginia Sentinel.' No two

</p>
<p>233'We had always been a warm personal and political
</p>
<p>friend of Governor Smith, and therefore the more
</p>
<p>deeply regretted the course he pursued in relation to
</p>
<p>the immediate and unconditional secession of Virginia.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Governor Smith was a
</p>
<p>Breckinridge Democrat,-a strong supporter of that
</p>
<p>party,-a strenuous advocate for the immediate secession of Virginia, and a violent opposer of the present
</p>
<p>Administration. But still, if Virginia did not secede,
</p>
<p>and if he were re-elected, he would serve in the Congress of the United States. So, likewise, with all the
</p>
<p>Breckinridge candidates in the State of Virginia. Hence
</p>
<p>the question arose in our mind, "How can gentlemen,
</p>
<p>on entering into office, swear, upon the Holy Bible, that
</p>
<p>they will observe, respect, and protect the laws of the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, when at the same time they are
</p>
<p>committed and pledged, if possible, to break up the
</p>
<p>Government?" To our mind there did appear to be
</p>
<p>some difficulty in this matter, although to others it
</p>
<p>might, and we suppose did, seem different.

<p>"Yes, everybody is in a fog, and everybody is

</p>
<p>the kind of reason, argument, and logic to frighten

<p>and utterly ignore all her former greatness and glory,
</p>
<p>to become frightened with pictorial representations of

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>" STAMPEDE.
</p>
<p>"Reader, do you know what this big word'stampede' means? You can't find it in any of your little
</p>
<p>dictionaries. It's a, big word, and is only found in big
</p>
<p>dictionaries, and belongs to big folks! In Webster's
</p>
<p>big dictionary it has the following meaning:-' In the
</p>
<p>Western States, a, sudden fright, seizing upon large
</p>
<p>bodies of cattle or horses in droves or encampments on
</p>
<p>prairies, and leading them to run for many miles, until
</p>
<p>they often sink down or die under their terrors.'
</p>
<p>" This word has recently been transferred from large
</p>
<p>bodies of cattle and horses to large bodies of negroowners, who, it is said, are threatened with a stampede
</p>
<p>terror, and will actually run away from Virginia and
</p>
<p>never stop in their flight until they sink down away
</p>
<p>in the safe, sunny plains of the far distant South, unless Virginia also becomes frightened and secedes and
</p>
<p>runs away down South too: in which event they
</p>
<p>promise to stay in Virginia and all go down South together. That will be nice: won't it, now?
</p>
<p>~" What does all this mean but a threat to those citizens of Virginia who, in the event of danger, are not
</p>
<p>able to enter upon this stampede? It simply means
</p>
<p>this: unless those men in Virginia who are now opposed
</p>
<p>to secession, and who have not the means to gather up
</p>
<p>their goods and chattels and remove South, turn secessionists and force Virginia out of the Union, they will be
</p>
<p>left to the mercy of their'Abolition enemies,' to fight
</p>
<p>their own battles and defend their own rights as best
</p>
<p>they can. Does this show that the men who boast
</p>
<p>and threaten stampedes have any fraternal regard for

</p>
<p>237
</p>
<p>to remain and fight and contend for their rights at
</p>
<p>home on their own native, sacred soil? No. Is not
</p>
<p>this a daring threat to force men to act contrary to
</p>
<p>their better judgment, conscientious principles, and
</p>
<p>patriotic spirit? It is. And does it not argue a
</p>
<p>cowardly and submissive spirit in those men who forsake the graves of their ancestors, leave their own
</p>
<p>native soil, and give up their own pleasant homes because of an anticipated enemy? Do brave men act
</p>
<p>thus? No. Will freemen be awed by such arguments
</p>
<p>and threats into servile submission to the treasonable
</p>
<p>will of such men? We hope not.
</p>
<p>" But suppose they do go. What then? Will the lovely
</p>
<p>hills and valleys and beautiful plains of Virginia become
</p>
<p>desolate, filled with thorns, briers, and thistles, and be
</p>
<p>abandoned forever? And will the beautiful cottages
</p>
<p>and splendid mansions of these stampeders become the
</p>
<p>dwelling-places of wild beasts, bats, and owls? No:
</p>
<p>there is not a word of truth in the whole of it. It
</p>
<p>would only hasten the abolition of slavery in Virginia,
</p>
<p>and free labor would take the place of slave labor, and
</p>
<p>Virginia lands would advance two hundred per cent. in
</p>
<p>value. Hence, we argue that men who make such
</p>
<p>threats are, in fact, the real Abolitionists and submissionists of Virginia, whether they mean it or not.
</p>
<p>Political demagogues make these threats to'fire up the
</p>
<p>Southern heart,' to force Virginia out of the Union.

<p>him to retain in office Reuben Thom, Esq., who is now

</p>
<p>of both seeing and signing it. We sincerely hope that
</p>
<p>Mr. Thom may be retained in office: first, because he

<p>is emphatically a good man; secondly, because he is an

</p>
<p>Secessionists had sneered at the idea of living under

</p>
<p>for the United States Congress should be elected, and
</p>
<p>that subsequently Virginia should secede from the

<p>Union: what then will these gentlemen do? Of course
</p>
<p>they will vacate their seats in Congress. What then?
</p>
<p>They will seek an asylum in the'Southern Confederacy.' But will they not have to be re-elected? And
</p>
<p>is it certain, if Virginia secede, that she will join
</p>
<p>the'Southern Confederacy'? This will have to be left
</p>
<p>to the vote of the sovereign people! In any event, we
</p>
<p>think that these secession candidates, who are trying

<p>to break up the Union and to destroy the Government,
</p>
<p>are in rather an awkward predicament. Remember,

<p>Suppose it shall be ratified. The next question is,

<p>what course will Virginia pursue? Will she join the' Southern Confederacy,' or will she'set up for herself'?

</p>
<p>CHAPTEIB XXVIII.
</p>
<p>TH3E CONSPIRACY UNVEILED VIRGINIA SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>IN the present chapter we propose to group facts and
</p>
<p>circumstances together, that the reader may more
</p>
<p>clearly understand some of the influences by which
</p>
<p>Virginia was forced out of the Union.
</p>
<p>On the 11th of April, 1861, at the time we published
</p>
<p>the editorials contained in the last chapter, Virginia
</p>
<p>was undulating on the thin surface which covered an
</p>
<p>iniquitous sinki of treason, deep, dark, and black as perdition itself. In fact, she had been driven to the lofty
</p>
<p>summit, and stood trembling on the awful precipice of
</p>
<p>ruin, to overlook which maddened the brain and sickened the heart, while no eye could fathom the terrible
</p>
<p>chasm below, save the omniscient eye of the great God
</p>
<p>of the universe.
</p>
<p>Already had the Virginia Convention been in session
</p>
<p>for nearly two months, having organized about the 13th
</p>
<p>of the preceding February, and up to the 11th of April
</p>
<p>had failed to pass an ordinance of secession. Every
</p>
<p>possible outside pressure had been employed to force
</p>
<p>that body to pass an ordinance of secession, but without
</p>
<p>effect. The importance of deposing Governor Letcher
</p>
<p>and of breaking up the convention was boldly advocated by the secessionists. They argued that the convention was too slow in its operations. The people
</p>
<p>(that is, the secessionists) were tired waiting the tardy
</p>
<p>movements of the convention. Hence originated the

<p>plot to usurp the power to depose Governor Letcher, to
</p>
<p>break up the convention, and to put others in their
</p>
<p>places who would do the work at once. Hence, also,
</p>
<p>the call for a new, secret, secession convention, composed of true and reliable Southern-Rights men, to
</p>
<p>take into consideration "the course which Virginia
</p>
<p>should pursue in the present emergency."
</p>
<p>In a former chapter we alluded to a "new political
</p>
<p>move," and promised to notice it more particularly in
</p>
<p>a future chapter. To save the reader the trouble of
</p>
<p>referring to the previous chapter containing the " Circular," and our remarks on the same at the time we
</p>
<p>published it, and that he may be the better enabled to
</p>
<p>comprehend the whole scope and design at a single
</p>
<p>glance, we will here give them another insertion. Read
</p>
<p>the "Circular:" it is pregnant with meaning, especially
</p>
<p>when taken in connection with all the circumstances
</p>
<p>attending the passage of a secession ordinance by the
</p>
<p>Virginia Convention, and the overthrow of the Republic.
</p>
<p>"A NEW POLITICAL MOVE."
</p>
<p>The "Richmond Whig" publishes the following circular, copies of which, it states, have been sent in large

<p>numbers to the country, and asks, "What does it

<p>good, we fear, to our country. Look at it! Think
</p>
<p>of it!"
</p>
<p>A volume is here unfolded for the serious contemplation of the reader, which presents a picture of one of
</p>
<p>the blackest plots of damnable treason to be found in
</p>
<p>the records of the world's history! Why were "large
</p>
<p>numbers" of these infamous circulars sent to the
</p>
<p>country?
</p>
<p>To what class of persons were they sent? Not to
</p>
<p>"Union-shriekers, submissionists, and traitors," but
</p>
<p>to "true and reliable men," who were sworn, no
</p>
<p>doubt, to exert every influence and power within their
</p>
<p>reach to force Virginia out of the Union, and, consequently, to effect the overthrow of the Federal Government.
</p>
<p>Why was the time of holding this treasonable convention left blank? Were the traitors afraid that there
</p>
<p>would be a ground-swell of Union men then and there,
</p>
<p>who might upset the whole conspiracy?
</p>
<p>Why were the names of the persons to whom these
</p>
<p>country traitors were to report themselves "and companions immediately on arriving at Richmond" left
</p>
<p>blank? Were they afraid that the "submissionists to
</p>
<p>old Abe Lincoln" might stealthily get into the secrets
</p>
<p>of their infernal machinations, and report them to the
</p>
<p>loyal authorities at Richmond?
</p>
<p>Why did they leave the place at which these "true
</p>
<p>and reliable men" and their "companions" were to
</p>
<p>rendezvous blank? Were they afraid that some who
</p>
<p>belonged to the "tail-end of the Northern Confederacy" would linger in disguise about the place at which

</p>
<p>245
</p>
<p>learn something of their diabolical plot, and thus break
</p>
<p>up the conspiracy?
</p>
<p>Whom did they mean by "friends of Southern
</p>
<p>Rights," but sirnon-pure secessionists, "true and reliable men," who had been baptized, head and heels, soul
</p>
<p>and body, in the sink-pool of Breckinridge locofoco
</p>
<p>treason?
</p>
<p>Why did they wish "to consult as to the course
</p>
<p>which Virginia should pursue in the present emergency"? Were not the members of the Virginia Convention, who had been elected by the popular vote of
</p>
<p>the citizens of the State, at that very time in consultation "as to the course which Virginia should pursue in
</p>
<p>the present emergency"?
</p>
<p>*Why this deep and earnest solicitude for full delegations, but to be able to usurp the authority, depose
</p>
<p>Governor Letcher, burst up and annihilate the Virginia
</p>
<p>Convention, organize themselves into a self-created body,
</p>
<p>vote themselves the State of Virginia, as the Legislature of Virginia had already set them the example, and
</p>
<p>force an ordinance of secession upon the people of Virginia, in the event that they should fail to force the
</p>
<p>Virginia Convention to do it for them?
</p>
<p>"Please bring with you, or send, a full delegation."
</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, could language be more significant? At the time these treasonable circulars
</p>
<p>were being sent all through the "country," an overwhelming majority of the members of the Virginia Convention were Union men. Governor Letcher himself was
</p>
<p>reported as being a Union man. And there were thousands of the citizens of Richmond Union men, and a
</p>
<p>majority of them would have remained loyal to Virginia
</p>
<p>and to the Federal Government to this day, no doubt,

</p>
<p>had it not been for this treasonable secession convention, and the circumstances connected with it, all of
</p>
<p>which hurried and forced the Virginia Convention to
</p>
<p>commit the suicidal act. In view of the strong Union
</p>
<p>feeling which still burned in the bosoms of the members of the convention and the citizens of Richmond,
</p>
<p>it was important and absolutely necessary that full
</p>
<p>delegations "of true and reliable men" should be
</p>
<p>sent from all the counties in Virginia. As if they had
</p>
<p>said, "We expect hot work- in Richmond on the blank
</p>
<p>day of the blank month; that is, on the 16th day of
</p>
<p>April, 1861, we shall in all probability meet with
</p>
<p>and have to contend against powerful influences and
</p>
<p>forces: therefore, please bring with you, or send, full
</p>
<p>delegations of true and reliable men from your own
</p>
<p>county, and, if convenient, aid the same object in the
</p>
<p>surrounding counties."
</p>
<p>We again ask, what kind of aid was to be extended
</p>
<p>to the accomplices in treason "in the surrounding
</p>
<p>counties" to further on the same nefarious object of
</p>
<p>sending traitors to Richmond? Were they to be aided
</p>
<p>with clothing, transportation, money to pay their expenses, and munitions of war to enable them effectively
</p>
<p>and effectually to consummate their infernal plot of
</p>
<p>treason against the commonwealth of Virginia, and,
</p>
<p>consequently, against the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States?
</p>
<p>Look, also, at the localities, standing, and position
</p>
<p>of the men whose signatures are affixed to these treasonable circulars, which were sent in great numbers all

<p>247
</p>
<p>wards known as the "Wise legion?" Was it not in
</p>
<p>contemplation that these "true and reliable men,"
</p>
<p>thoroughly armed as they were, should be on hand at
</p>
<p>this great secret secession convention? Who can
</p>
<p>doubt it? Was not Henry A. Wise the very man to
</p>
<p>head and lead on an army or mob of locofoco traitors
</p>
<p>to accomplish the diabolical work of breaking up the
</p>
<p>Government, to the end that he in his ungodly ambition might usurp the power and become the great
</p>
<p>leading spirit in the Virginia revolution and the man
</p>
<p>in the new Southern Confederacy?
</p>
<p>And where, too, were the "one hundred and twenty
</p>
<p>thousand members of the order of Knights of the
</p>
<p>Golden Circle"? The Norfolk "Day-Book," early in
</p>
<p>the month of December, 1860, contained the following
</p>
<p>significant paragraph:"THE K. G. C.'S AND THIE SLAVE-HOLDING STATES.Colonel V. D. Groner, Knight of the Golden Circle, has
</p>
<p>returned to this city. He has been to Texas, and returned home via Mississippi. His mission South and
</p>
<p>Southwest was in connection with the order of Knights
</p>
<p>of the Golden Circle. We learn from Colonel Groner
</p>
<p>that there are one hundred and twenty thousand
</p>
<p>members of the order of Knights of the Golden Circle,
</p>
<p>each one of whom is sworn to stand by the South.
</p>
<p>They are fully organized, and are constantly drilling,
</p>
<p>and can be brought into action, if necessary, in two
</p>
<p>weeks' time."
</p>
<p>Here is a conspiracy on a grand scale! One hundred and twenty thousand men, " each one of whom is
</p>
<p>sworn to stand by the South;" these men were "constantly drilling, and could be brought into action in

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>sworn, drilled, and armed men would be on hand at
</p>
<p>this secret secession convention, which was to be composed of "true and reliable men"? And does not this
</p>
<p>clearly explain, also, what the framers of that "circular" meant by " true and reliable men"? Men who
</p>
<p>had been sworn to "stand by the South," or who had
</p>
<p>been sworn to break up the Government in the event
</p>
<p>that Mr. Lincoln was elected and they themselves were
</p>
<p>defeated; presuming upon the election of Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>as a sufficient reason to justify them in their diabolical plot to break up the Government, and involve the
</p>
<p>whole country in one common ruin, in the event that
</p>
<p>they could not succeed. In other words, here are one
</p>
<p>hundred and twenty thousand men, who are sworn to
</p>
<p>stand by the "Slave States," or the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery, even if the Republic be annihilated, the country
</p>
<p>steeped in blood, and thousands of helpless women
</p>
<p>made widows and millions of children made orphans!
</p>
<p>Gracious God! What a dark volume is here unfolded
</p>
<p>for the contemplation of the reader!
</p>
<p>But, reader, this is not all. As was subsequently
</p>
<p>ascertained, this secession convention was to meet in
</p>
<p>the city of Richmond on the 16th day of April, 1861;
</p>
<p>and as soon as we learned the time when this treasonable conclave would assemble, we wrote the following
</p>
<p>paragraph, which was published in the number of the
</p>
<p>"Christian Banner" of the 11th of April, 1861, and
</p>
<p>which we republish, that the reader may understand the
</p>
<p>working of this plot, and that it was talked of and
</p>
<p>publicly understood, and by the people of Virginia
</p>
<p>believed to be in contemplation, and of the truth of

<p>which there can now be no doubt, not even in the
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>249
</p>
<p>mind of the most skeptical. The following is the
</p>
<p>paragraph:"What does this secession convention, which is to
</p>
<p>meet in the city of Richmond on the 16th instant, mean?
</p>
<p>Does that convention intend to depose Governor
</p>
<p>Letcher, and force Virginia out of the Union whether
</p>
<p>she will or not? This will be a high-handed move, and
</p>
<p>one which every loyal son of Virginia and the whole
</p>
<p>South ought to repel, at every hazard. The people
</p>
<p>of Virginia are not yet prepared to be run over
</p>
<p>roughshod by tyrants, without lifting their voice
</p>
<p>against it."
</p>
<p>To effect a collision between the authorities of the
</p>
<p>United States and the " Confederate States of America"
</p>
<p>had become, about this, time, the one great maniacc
</p>
<p>of the leading secessionists of Virginia and of the
</p>
<p>whole South. They said that if a single gun was fired,
</p>
<p>Virginia and all the border States would certainly
</p>
<p>secede, and that immediately. A correspondent of
</p>
<p>the "Richmond Dispatch," writing from Petersburg,
</p>
<p>says,"PETERSBURG, April 6. The excitement here is very
</p>
<p>great, and the'war' tidings are discussed at every corner. The people say,'Let it come.' The indignation
</p>
<p>of the people at the course of the convention is at a
</p>
<p>high pitch."
</p>
<p>Why was the "indignation of the people" (the secessionists of Petersburg) "at the course of the convention at a high pitch"? Simply because that convention had been in session for nearly two months, and
</p>
<p>had failed to pass an ordinance of secession. For the

</p>
<p>secessionists of Petersburg said, "Let it (war) come."
</p>
<p>This shows the uncompromising determination of the
</p>
<p>secessionists of Virginia to secede, at the time of which
</p>
<p>we are writing.
</p>
<p>A correspondent, writing from Goldsboro', North
</p>
<p>Carolina, to the Richmond "Dispatch," under date of
</p>
<p>April 6, says,"GOLDSBORO', N.C., April 6.-The news of outfitting
</p>
<p>the fleet and army at the North is very exciting, and
</p>
<p>the community wish to hear of an attack on Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter. The military are ready to assist the Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy."
</p>
<p>Why did the "community" (that is, the secessionists) in the town of Goldsboro' wish to hear of an attack on Fort Sumter? They knew that a collision between the Federal and Confederate troops'would tend
</p>
<p>very much to the precipitating of Virginia out of
</p>
<p>the Union, and then North Carolina would certainly
</p>
<p>follow.
</p>
<p>A despatch from Charleston, South Carolina, under
</p>
<p>date of April 6, says," CRHARLESTON, April 6.-We are by no means disappointed at the news, and are now ready to receive our

</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>251
</p>
<p>sion intended to be made by the correspondent, is that
</p>
<p>such was the impatience of the people to have the ball
</p>
<p>opened, that, unless the authorities of the Confederate
</p>
<p>Government should speedily make an attack on Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter, the people would usurp the authority, assume
</p>
<p>the responsibility, and inaugurate civil war themselves.
</p>
<p>The leaders had already usurped the authority and
</p>
<p>power of the Government, and were determined to inaugurate civil war, to force the border States out of the
</p>
<p>Union; and then libelled the people, saying that theythe people-had done it,-when, in fact, the people had
</p>
<p>no voice, directly or indirectly, in the whole matter.
</p>
<p>It was, therefore, a libel on the people, from beginning
</p>
<p>to end. The people never usurped the power; they
</p>
<p>never desired to do it; and the leaders would not have
</p>
<p>allowed them to do it, even if they had wished. The
</p>
<p>leaders in this accursed rebellion usurped all the power
</p>
<p>from the people, did all the mischief, and then, as a
</p>
<p>sort of vanacea for the national, political, social, and
</p>
<p>universal ruin which they inflicted on their country, said,
</p>
<p>to justify themselves, and to make the people still think
</p>
<p>that they held the power, "the sovereign people
</p>
<p>did it all." Yes, the "sovereigns have done it."
</p>
<p>Breckinridge locofocoism is the child of the devil,-the
</p>
<p>spawn of hell,-the enemy of all righteousness,-the
</p>
<p>destroyer of a nation's happiness,-and would, if possible, demolish all Governments, human and divine, and
</p>
<p>sink the world in a sea of damnation, to sit on a throne
</p>
<p>of human skulls and shout hosannas to "King Cotton" and the ETERNAL nigger. Who would not blush
</p>
<p>to utter a whisper in justification of a monster so hideous, even in the hearing of devils damned!

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>the Federal and Confederate troops, the secessionists at
</p>
<p>Richmond despatched the Hon. Roger A. Pryor to
</p>
<p>Charleston, South Carolina, to "fire up the heart" of
</p>
<p>the authorities there to make an attack on Fort Sumter before the 16th day of April, the time of the meeting of the secession convention,-knowing that, if this
</p>
<p>were done, it would be a much easier matter to force
</p>
<p>the Virginia Convention to pass an ordinance of secession. What man in all Virginia was better fitted for
</p>
<p>such a mission than Roger A. Pryor?
</p>
<p>On arriving in Charleston, he publicly addressed the
</p>
<p>people, and by his frequent "bursts of unsurpassed,
</p>
<p>fervent eloquence," he soon set the city in one universal
</p>
<p>blaze of patriotic enthusiasm; and, the citizens enchained, enraptured, and electrified by his eloquent
</p>
<p>addresses, it became an easy matter to influence them
</p>
<p>to determine to commence the work which he desired,
</p>
<p>above all things, they should do. He told a thrilling
</p>
<p>story,-and he told that story well. Said he, "I have
</p>
<p>been asked my opinion relative to the ultimate action
</p>
<p>of the Virginia Convention. I answer,-the final action of the Virginia Convention depends upon a single
</p>
<p>contingency! Do you ask what that contingency is?"
</p>
<p>significantly pointing in the direction:-" Fire on _Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter, and Virginia is with you!"
</p>
<p>The intelligence went with lightning speed to Jeff
</p>
<p>Davis, at Montgomery, Alabama. "What shall we
</p>
<p>do?" was the question. " Fire on Fort Sumter!" was
</p>
<p>the laconic reply. And be it remembered that on Friday evening, the 12th day of April, 1861, civil war was
</p>
<p>inaugurated at Charleston, South Carolina, by the authorities of the "Confederate States" firing on the

</p>
<p>253
</p>
<p>ading was resumed on Saturday morning, the 13th of
</p>
<p>April, 1861, and on that ever-memorable day Fort
</p>
<p>Sumter fell, and was surrendered up to the authorities
</p>
<p>of the "Confederate States of America." The timehonored "flag,"-the " flag" respected the world over,the " flag" which represented the greatest, most powerful,
</p>
<p>prosperous, and happy nation on earth,-was insulted,
</p>
<p>hauled down, and made to trail in the dust, and a
</p>
<p>little, contemptible secesh flag, the emblem of treason,
</p>
<p>and the embodiment of all folly, madness, and wickedness, was run up in its stead. And all this was done
</p>
<p>by the people who had been protected by that flag all
</p>
<p>their lives, and their fathers before them.
</p>
<p>The effect of the downfall of Fort Sumter on the
</p>
<p>citizens of Charleston and the South generally may be
</p>
<p>inferred from the following despatches:" [Special despatches to the' Petersburg (Va.) Express.']

</p>
<p>intelligence of the downfall of Fort Sumter received by

<p>of the State generally, the reader may form a faint
</p>
<p>idea of what transpired there from the following editorials which we published in the number of the
</p>
<p>"Christian Banner" of the 18th of April, 1861:" On last Saturday evening the news of the surrender of Fort Sumter was received by telegraphic despatch in Fredericksburg,-since which time the greatest

<p>excitement has prevailed, and it seems to continue
</p>
<p>unabated.
</p>
<p>"On the receipt of the news on Saturday evening,
</p>
<p>several guns were fired, the soldiers paraded the
</p>
<p>streets, several speeches were delivered, many cheers
</p>
<p>were given, and the doleful'tiger groans' fell upon our
</p>
<p>ear like the deep mutterings of demons coming up from
</p>
<p>the regions of despair. At night bonfires were kindled,
</p>
<p>as if the actors in the drama were eager for light to
</p>
<p>see the downfall of the Republic and the departure of
</p>
<p>a nation's glory! Such is the progress of American

</p>
<p>children find themselves scattered abroad, homeless,
</p>
<p>penniless, and friendless, thrown upon the cold charity
</p>
<p>of a heartless world, among unfeeling and unsympathizing strangers,-then they wake up to the sad and
</p>
<p>startling reality that they have lost a mother, a
</p>
<p>mother's protection, a mother's blessing, and a mother's
</p>
<p>love: no one to feel for and love them as a mother did.
</p>
<p>"In like manner men may make merry now, while our

<p>blessed country, the mother of us all, is convulsed and
</p>
<p>agonizing in the last throes of existence; but as soon
</p>
<p>as she sleeps the sleep which knows no waking, we, her
</p>
<p>ungrateful children, will wake up to the sad and thrilling reality that we have no country, the common nursing-mother of us all, no peaceful, quiet home, no
</p>
<p>legacy, no inheritance to bequeath to our children to
</p>
<p>be handed down to posterity. The downfall of our
</p>
<p>country and the inauguration of civil war seem to us
</p>
<p>like the madness of men walking, alive, wide awake,

<p>into eternity. The thought is terrible beyond conception. Angels might weep, and heaven veil herself in
</p>
<p>sackcloth and ashes, at the downfall of a country so
</p>
<p>great and powerful and prosperous as ours. Could
</p>
<p>our own life be substituted as a sacrifice for the salvation of our blessed country, freely and quickly should
</p>
<p>the sacrifice be made. We ardently trust in God that

<p>sounded. We will still try to hope that she may yet

<p>be saved.

</p>
<p>Let us now return to our investigation of the incidental circumstances connected with the passage of the
</p>
<p>ordinance of secession by the Virginia Convention.
</p>
<p>The reader will bear in mind that the attack was made
</p>
<p>on Fort Sumter by the authorities of the Confederate States, at Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday,
</p>
<p>the 12th day of April, 1861. Simultaneously with the
</p>
<p>attack on Fort Sumter and the inauguration of civil
</p>
<p>war by the Confederate authorities at Charleston, the
</p>
<p>following proclamation was issued by the President of
</p>
<p>the Confederate States of America at Montgomery,
</p>
<p>Alabama:PROCLAMATION BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA.
</p>
<p>"Whereas, an extraordinary occasion has occurred,
</p>
<p>rendering it necessary and proper that the Congress
</p>
<p>of the Confederate States shall convene, to receive
</p>
<p>and act upon such communications as may be made
</p>
<p>to it on the part of the Executive:
</p>
<p>" Now, therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, President of the

</p>
<p>day of April, Anno Domini 1861.
</p>
<p>" JEFFERSON DAVIS,
</p>
<p>"By the President.
</p>
<p>" R. TooMBs, Secretary of State."
</p>
<p>The question naturally forces itself upon the mind
</p>
<p>of the reader, what'extraordinary occasion' had'occurred rendering it necessary and proper' that President
</p>
<p>Davis should issue his proclamation on the 12th day of
</p>
<p>April for the convocation of the Congress of the
</p>
<p>Confederate States on the 29th day of April, 1861?
</p>
<p>Who can fail to discover and detect at a single glance
</p>
<p>the whole scheme devised, and the agencies and means
</p>
<p>to be used, to consummate a conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>commonwealth of Virginia and the Federal Government, black and base as hell?
</p>
<p>President Davis knew, and he knew well, that important communications would be received by him, and
</p>
<p>that to make them valid, and at all popular with the
</p>
<p>people, they would have to receive the sanction of
</p>
<p>the Confederate Congress. He knew that an ordinance of secession would be passed, by which Virginia would be forced out of the Union. He knew
</p>
<p>that delegates, or commissioners, would be sent by the
</p>
<p>authorities at Richmond, whoever these authorities
</p>
<p>might be, to tie Virginia on to the Southern Confederacy before the people of Virginia should have time to
</p>
<p>vote upon the action of the convention. - He knew that
</p>
<p>Virginia would be literally filled with armed troops
</p>
<p>before the day of election on which the action of the

<p>Virginia Convention should be ratified or nullified by

</p>
<p>261
</p>
<p>the popular vote of the State. He knew that the
</p>
<p>people of the State would be forced to vote for the
</p>
<p>ratification of the action of the convention at the
</p>
<p>point of the bayonet. He knew that Richmond would
</p>
<p>be his head-quarters, and he was making his preparations to remove there. He knew that Virginia would
</p>
<p>be the great battle-field and the common burial-ground
</p>
<p>of this wicked, cruel, and infernal war. Yes, President
</p>
<p>Davis knew all these things before he issued his proclasnation for the convocation of the Congress of the
</p>
<p>Confederate States.
</p>
<p>The collision between the two governmental authorities was consummated! The Hon. Roger A. Pryor
</p>
<p>had thoroughly effected the object and design of his
</p>
<p>infernal mission to Charleston, South Carolina. The
</p>
<p>blow was struck at Fort Sumter on the 12th day of
</p>
<p>April, 1861, and on the 13th day of April, 1861, the
</p>
<p>fort was captured and turned over to General Beauregard by Major Anderson. On Tuesday, the 16th, after
</p>
<p>the downfall of Fort Sumter on Saturday, the 13th
</p>
<p>day of April, the secession convention met in Richmond. Remember the words, "Fire on Fort Sumter,
</p>
<p>and Virginia is with you!" Pryor had told the authorities at Charleston that unless a collision between
</p>
<p>the troops of the Federal and Confederate Governments could be effected, the Virginia Convention would
</p>
<p>never pass an ordinance of secession. We wish the
</p>
<p>reader especially to bear in mind that on Saturday,
</p>
<p>the 13th day of April, 1861, Fort Sumter fell; that
</p>
<p>on Tuesday, the 16th day of April, 1861, the secession

<p>convention met in the city of Richmond, Virginia; that

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>Thursday, the 18th day of April, Anno Domini 1861,
</p>
<p>the Virginia Convention, in secret session, passed and
</p>
<p>forced upon the people of the State of Virginia an
</p>
<p>ordinance of secession, by which the State of Virginia
</p>
<p>was declared out of the Union. Virginia was doomed,
</p>
<p> sacrificed on the altar of a set of ungodly, ambitious
</p>
<p>demagogues and traitors!
</p>
<p>As further evidence that it was a part of the programme of the traitors of Virginia, in order to fully
</p>
<p>consummate their damnable plot of treason against the
</p>
<p>State, to invite Jeff Davis and his armed troops into
</p>
<p>the State for the purpose of awing the people on the
</p>
<p>day of election into the ratification of the action of the

<p>Virginia Convention, we submit the following correspondence to the Richmond papers.
</p>
<p>"MONTGOMERY, Ap'il 16.-General Pillow has just
</p>
<p>arrived with an offer to President Davis of a division

<p>of Tennessee troops.

</p>
<p>will vacate his seat at Montgomery, and Stephens will

<p>assume its duties. Davis will then make Richmond his

</p>
<p>thirty-two thousand more troops will be called out today to meet Lincoln's men."
</p>
<p>On the above correspondence we made the following
</p>
<p>remarks, which were published in the number of the
</p>
<p>"Christian Banner" of April 18, 1861:"Civil war is inaugurated, and Richmond is to be
</p>
<p>the head-quarters of President Davis. Why is the
</p>
<p>seat of war transferred from the Gulf States to Virginia? Has not Virginia used every effort to avert a
</p>
<p>civil war and to save, if possible, the whole country
</p>
<p>from ruin? Why, then, make Richmond the headquarters of a long-protracted civil war, and Virginia
</p>
<p>the common battle-ground? Such would be the state
</p>
<p>of universal excitement that business of all kinds,
</p>
<p>in towns and cities, would be brought to a perfect
</p>
<p>stand-still, and all agricultural and farming operations
</p>
<p>would, of necessity, become to a very alarming extent
</p>
<p>neglected. A long-protracted civil war would devastate Virginia and reduce her to a state of complete
</p>
<p>desolation. It is horrible to think of, much less to
</p>
<p>realize.
</p>
<p>"If the people of Virginia wish to vote themselves
</p>
<p>into a civil war, into a common ruin, their territory
</p>
<p>into a slaughter-pen of blood and death and all the
</p>
<p>horrors concomitant upon a civil war,-let them go to
</p>
<p>the ballot-box and do it. Does Virginia wish to precipitate herself into the gulf of irreparable ruin? Is
</p>
<p>she prepared for a catastrophe so awfully horrible and
</p>
<p>revolting? Surely not!"

<p>On the very day the above editorial remarks were

<p>264
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>published in the " Christian Banner," the ordinance of
</p>
<p>secession was passed in the Virginia Convention and
</p>
<p>forced upon the citizens of the State. One undisturbed
</p>
<p>halo of glory had surrounded the secessionists of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg from the time they received the news
</p>
<p>of the taking of Fort Sumter up to the time that the
</p>
<p>joyful tidings of the passage of the ordinance of secession by the Virginia Convention sounded in their
</p>
<p>ears; and then they became absolutely intolerable. The
</p>
<p>reign of terror then commenced in earnest. Worthless
</p>
<p>men, and little secesh boys who had hardly doffed their
</p>
<p>infant rags, felt fully authorized, being tolerated by
</p>
<p>popular opinion and legally indemnified by the ordinance of the convention, to offer all kinds of insults
</p>
<p>and indignities to Union men. Immediately it was
</p>
<p>proclaimed publicly on the streets that there was
</p>
<p>no need of an election by the people; that Virginia
</p>
<p>had seceded; that the members of the convention
</p>
<p>voted unanimously, with the exception of five or six,and two or three of these were absent, and would certainly have voted for the ordinance had they been
</p>
<p>present; that no man would dare to vote in opposition
</p>
<p>to the ratification of the ordinance; that tar and
</p>
<p>feathers and sharp fence-rails would be liberally applied to all Union-shriekers, submissionists, and old
</p>
<p>Lincolnites, who might any longer dare to express an
</p>
<p>opinion favorable to the "hateful old flag of the
</p>
<p>Union" or that the Federal Government should be sustained. It is absolutely impossible for any one who
</p>
<p>was not an eye and ear witness, and who was not a
</p>
<p>subject of the infernal goadings continually inflicted
</p>
<p>on Union men by the silent and open insinuations,

</p>
<p>to form any correct idea of the intolerant and vindictive spirit manifested, and the ridiculous extravagances to which secessionists, in their treasonable
</p>
<p>madness, were driven. It was hell all over, inside and
</p>
<p>outside.
</p>
<p>With secessionists it was a perfect jubilee, a time

<p>of great and universal rejoicing, surpassing in extravagant manifestations of joy and gladness those of the

<p>captivity and bondage of seventy years in Babylon.

<p>Exclamations like the following were heard in all

</p>
<p>very day that the secession convention met in Richmond:-" Everybody is delighted with the encouraging
</p>
<p>news from Virginia." What news was it from Virginia which so much delighted everybody in Montgomery? The jubilant effect produced upon the secessionists of Virginia at the collision which had been
</p>
<p>brought about between the Confederate and Federal
</p>
<p>troops, and the downfall of Fort Sumter, and the
</p>
<p>certainty that the Virginia Convention would be
</p>
<p>broken up by an armed mob of secessionists unless
</p>
<p>that convention passed an ordinance of secession, and
</p>
<p>that a sef-cereated body of secessionists would pass an
</p>
<p>ordinance of secession and force Virginia out of the
</p>
<p>Union. In a word, the absolute and unconditional
</p>
<p>certainty that Virginia would be forced out of the
</p>
<p>Union and tied on to the Southern Confederacy by a
</p>
<p>set of political swindlers and traitors caused "everybody" in Montgomery to be delighted with the "encouraging news from Virginia." Remember, likewise, that General Pillow had just arrived with an
</p>
<p>offer to President Davis of a division of Tennessee
</p>
<p>troops; that, should Virginia unite with the Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy, President Davis would vacate his seat at
</p>
<p>Montgomery, would then make Richmond his headquarters within ten days; Stephens would assume
</p>
<p>the duties of the vacated seat of Davis at Montgomery; Beauregard would be second in command;
</p>
<p>Bragg would take care of Pensacola; the Cabinet at
</p>
<p>Montgomery had read Lincoln's proclamation amidst
</p>
<p>bursts of laughter, (quite dignified and patriotic for a

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>was the whole programmne laid out and sent to Richmond two days in advance of the passage of the ordinance of secession by the Virginia Convention! Was
</p>
<p>ever such villany, trickery, rascality, and damnable
</p>
<p>treason read of, heard of, or thoztght of, since God
</p>
<p>made the world? As to the secession of Virginia,
</p>
<p>there existed not a doubt in the minds of the members
</p>
<p>of the Cabinet at MSontgomery, because they knew that
</p>
<p>if the Virginia Convention could not be forced to pass
</p>
<p>an ordinance of secession, the called convention, composed entirely of " true and reliable" secessionists, would
</p>
<p>usurp the authority and pass it themselves and force
</p>
<p>Virginia out of the Union.
</p>
<p>A correspondent from Montgomery to the Richmond
</p>
<p>papers, under date of April 30, says,6' MONTGOMERY, ALA., April 30.-Sixteen thousand
</p>
<p>good troops have just started for Virginia. The question, whether the Confederate Government will remain
</p>
<p>here or move to Richmond, is now under earnest consideration, and still pending. I will not undertake to
</p>
<p>state the probabilities of the decision."
</p>
<p>The reader will bear in mind that the ordinance of
</p>
<p>secession was passed in the Virginia Convention on the
</p>
<p>18th day of April, 1861; and on the 30th day of April,
</p>
<p>1861, twelve days after the ordinance was passed by
</p>
<p>the convention, "sixteen thousand good troops started"
</p>
<p>from Montgomery, Alabama, "for Virginia;" and that
</p>
<p>the day of election, on which the citizens of the State
</p>
<p>of Virginia were to vote on the all-important question
</p>
<p>of ratification or no ratification of the action of the
</p>
<p>convention, did not take place until the 23d day of
</p>
<p>May, 1861, being more than one whole month from the

</p>
<p>to the time when the vote was to be taken by the citizens
</p>
<p>of the State; and this time, too, was given, not that the
</p>
<p>people might coolly and deliberately decide on a question involving the whole of their worldly interests, and
</p>
<p>perhaps, likewise, their eternal destinies, but for the
</p>
<p>purpose of giving time and opportunity to the authorities of the Confederate States to crowd armed
</p>
<p>troops into Virginia, to be ready to awe the citizens of
</p>
<p>the State into submission on the day of election. We
</p>
<p>ask if this was fair play. Was it not a usurpation of
</p>
<p>authority? Was it not wresting the power from the
</p>
<p>people of Virginia, and placing it in the hands of a few
</p>
<p>petty tyrants, a few infernal traitors?
</p>
<p>As early as the 5th of May, 1861, the "Lynchburg
</p>
<p>Virginian" said,"Six additional companies of the 3d Regiment of
</p>
<p>Alabama Volunteers arrived in this city about five
</p>
<p>o'clock yesterday morning. The entire regiment is
</p>
<p>now here, together with all its officers, except Colonel
</p>
<p>Withers. Lieutenant-Colonel Lomax arrived with the
</p>
<p>men yesterday."
</p>
<p>Regiments of troops from Texas, Arkansas, South
</p>
<p>Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and North Carolina, arrived in Fredericksburg early in the month of May, long
</p>
<p>before the day of election. Why were thousands on thousands of armed troops from all the seceded States hurried
</p>
<p>into Virginia, and stationed in all the important cities,
</p>
<p>towns, and villages, before the people of the State had
</p>
<p>even voted on the question of ratification or no ratification? Why were thousands of armed troops stationed
</p>
<p>at Richmond, Petersburg, Lynchburg, Fredericksburg,

</p>
<p>so blind and stupid as not to be able to perceive the
</p>
<p>whole design at a single glance? The design was, to
</p>
<p>awe Virginia at the point of the bayonet into submission, on the day of election, to vote for the ratification
</p>
<p>of the ordinance of secession. If five thousand votes
</p>
<p>had not been cast by the citizens of the State, on the
</p>
<p>day of election, for the ratification of the ordinance, still
</p>
<p>Virginia would have been forced out of the Union by
</p>
<p>foreign votes and military forces. Who knows, to
</p>
<p>this day, the number of votes polled on the 23d day of
</p>
<p>2May, 1861? The official returns, if ever received at
</p>
<p>Richmond, the head-quarters of treason, were never published to the world. Virginia was declared out of the
</p>
<p>Union by a large majority of votes voluntarily given
</p>
<p>by her citizens; which was, and is, and willforever remain a slander and libel black as hell upon the citizens
</p>
<p>of the State of Virginia.
</p>
<p>When the candidates were elected to the Virginia
</p>
<p>Convention, there was a majority of sixty thousand
</p>
<p>votes cast for the Union, and a large portion of these
</p>
<p>voters were in favor of the Union on the 23d day of
</p>
<p>May, 1861. Men were made to vote the secession
</p>
<p>ticket by force of circumstances, and influences which
</p>
<p>they could not control. Influential secessionists told
</p>
<p>their neighbors that, unless they voted for secession,
</p>
<p>neither they nor their children could ever command
</p>
<p>any standing or position in the country; that they
</p>
<p>would be brought under the ban of public censure,
</p>
<p>and would always be regarded as traitors and tories,
</p>
<p>and would become odious as were the tories and
</p>
<p>traitors of the Revolutionary War; that their property

<p>would be confiscated, taken from them and given to the

</p>
<p>Such, reader, were some of the influences which were

<p>brought to bear on the action of the people of Virginia
</p>
<p>prior to the day of election; in addition to which, bear

<p>in mind that at least one hundred and fifty thousand

<p>armed troops from the seceded States were stationed at
</p>
<p>all the important points in Virginia, prepared to awe
</p>
<p>the people into submission.
</p>
<p>And as to the vote in the Virginia Convention,
</p>
<p>we were told that it was unanimous,-there being only
</p>
<p>some five or six members who did not vote for the ordinance of secession; yet when, subsequently, the injunction of secrecy was removed from the acts of that
</p>
<p>convention, it was ascertained that there were about
</p>
<p>forty-seven members of the convention who never did
</p>
<p>vote for the passage of tile ordinance at all. And this
</p>
<p>was another daimniable swindle,-a downright imposition on the people of Virginia.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the convention forced the passage of
</p>
<p>the ordinance of secession than it set to work to tie

<p>Virginia forcibly on to the Southern Confederacy; to

<p>accomplish which, commissioners were appointed by the

<p>nominated and rejected. So, it seems, were Mr. Jenkins and Abdiel, always'faithful found,' in the northwest of the State, and Mr. Bocock on the other side of
</p>
<p>it. In their places the convention chose a Mr. Staples
</p>
<p>and a Mr. Camden. What they are, the convention
</p>
<p>only knows. All we can learn of them is the general

<p>report that they were microscopic, but very venomous,

<p>submissionists some time ago. If they now are any

<p>thing better, we shall be very glad; but at present it

<p>would appear that this delectable body that continues

</p>
<p>2 75
</p>
<p>1861, we published the following editorial remarks on
</p>
<p>the above article of the " Examiner":
</p>
<p>"Is it not an alarming usurpation of authority that
</p>
<p>the Virginia Convention should have appointed gentlemen to the Congress of the Confederate States at all?
</p>
<p>Was this the purpose for which the convention was
</p>
<p>called? We did not so understand it. Is it not an
</p>
<p>alarming usurpation of power that the convention
</p>
<p>should unite the destinies of the Old Dominion with
</p>
<p>the'Confederate States of America' before the vote of
</p>
<p>the citizens of the State is taken on the question?
</p>
<p>Are a million of freemen to be bartered and sold, and
</p>
<p>handed over to other authorities, without being consulted, and without their knowledge or consent, by a
</p>
<p>convention of men elected by the people to transact
</p>
<p>other and different matters? If we understand the
</p>
<p>subject, the convention was called together to decide on
</p>
<p>the policy as to the passage of an ordinance of secession or non-secession: after which the action of the
</p>
<p>convention was to be referred back to the sovereign,
</p>
<p>people for their ratification or rejection. The whole
</p>
<p>matter is pre-arranged and virtually fixed, and then
</p>
<p>the people are called on to vote for all the questions
</p>
<p>together! If this be the beginning of our new order
</p>
<p>of things, what will the end be?"
</p>
<p>Already had the Virginia Convention not only passed
</p>
<p>an ordinance of secession and sent delegates to the
</p>
<p>Congress of the Confederate States, but had actually
</p>
<p>"Resolved, That the President of the Confederate

</p>
<p>terest or convenience may require it, to make the city
</p>
<p>of Richmond, or some other place in this State, the
</p>
<p>seat of the government of the Confederacy."
</p>
<p>The Richmond " Examiner" said, 
</p>
<p>" The presence of Jefferson Davis in Richmond would
</p>
<p>be worth an army of fifty thousand men. He is the
</p>
<p>man for this hour. He would be obeyed. He could
</p>
<p>inspire confidence, and order, and energy everywhere.
</p>
<p>With others our troops will fight, and perhaps win the
</p>
<p>battle; but with him the victory would be sure, and
</p>
<p>chance certain."
</p>
<p>The reader cannot fail to observe the keen thrust the
</p>
<p>" Examiner" makes at the "very venomous submissionists," and the "three enemies of the Confederacy,"
</p>
<p>as also the thrust it makes at the whole convention
</p>
<p>when it says, " This will be the fitting finis of a session
</p>
<p>which should be remembered as one of the most remarkable chapters of parliamentary iniquity ever recorded in history." Why this editorial reflection on
</p>
<p>the reputation of Rives, Camden, and Staples? Simply

<p>because they were " some time ago very venomous submissionists," or, in other words, Union men. This, with
</p>
<p>the "Examiner," was sufficient evidence to convict
</p>
<p>them as being enemies of the Confederacy, and which
</p>
<p>should politically damn themn to infamy. The "Examiner" opposed any one holding office in the Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy whose antecedents on the question of
</p>
<p>secession were not above suspicion. Hence, also, the
</p>
<p>"Examiner's" reflections on the convention, an overwhelming majority of the members of which were
</p>
<p>Union men or "venomous submissionists" up to the
</p>
<p>time of the attack on Fort Sumter. The "Examiner"

</p>
<p>secessionist, and if he would only come to Richmond
</p>
<p>and issue his mandates "he would be obeyed." His
</p>
<p>"presence in Richmond would be worth an army of
</p>
<p>fifty thousand men" in subjugating the State of Virginia! Well, Jeff Davis came to Richmond, and
</p>
<p>brought with him his vast army, and had all his troops
</p>
<p>scattered over the State on the day of election, which,
</p>
<p>however, was nothing more than a mock-election; for,
</p>
<p>long in advance of the day on which the vote of the
</p>
<p>State was to be taken, the Democratic press of the
</p>
<p>South denounced every man who might dare to vote
</p>
<p>for the Union as being a traitor and an Abolitionist,
</p>
<p>who should be hung or else driven out of the South.
</p>
<p>And if they remained at home on the day of election,
</p>
<p>thus refusing to vote for secession, it would be evidence
</p>
<p>sufficient to convict them of having sympathy for the
</p>
<p>" old detestable Union," and they, too, should be driven
</p>
<p>out of the South, and all their property should be confiscated. And the Richmond "Examiner" declared
</p>
<p>that all who "professed recent conversion to secession
</p>
<p>were hypocrites," and of course ought not to be trusted.
</p>
<p>Such, kind reader, were the coercive agencies and
</p>
<p>influences employed to force Virginia out 6f the Union
</p>
<p>and to utter ruin. Nor was this all. Civil war was
</p>
<p>already inaugurated in Virginia. Gosport Navy-Yard,
</p>
<p>at Norfolk, Virginia, was already seized by the Confederate authorities, and the munitions of war were
</p>
<p>secured in great quantities, while thousands of troops
</p>
<p>were constantly being sent from the South to Norfolk
</p>
<p>and Portsmouth. Read the following despatches:"NORFOLK, April 20, 1861.-The navy-yard was

<p>About this time, also, the following despatch was

<p>received by Governor Letcher of Virginia, which seemed

<p>to favor the general impression among the secessionists

<p>would be out of the Union and into the Southern Confederacy in the shortest conceivable time, and that the

<p>279
</p>
<p>The night on which the newsi was received at the
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg Railroad depot of the destruction of
</p>
<p>Gosport Navy-Yard, and that the 7th Regiment of
</p>
<p>New York was literally cut to pieces, we were present,
</p>
<p>and listened to two enthusiastic speeches which were
</p>
<p>delivered to the crowd at the depot by two rampant,
</p>
<p>original secession orators, who had just arrived from
</p>
<p>Richmond with the "glad tidings." At the close of
</p>
<p>the last speech, after the deafening roar of the loud
</p>
<p>huzzas had partially died away, a fiendish shout was
</p>
<p>raised in the crowd, with the cry, "Where's Major
</p>
<p>Williams?" "Where's Major Williams?" " Yes, God
</p>
<p>damn him," was responded, "where is he?" "Where
</p>
<p>is he?" " Damn him, let's tar-and-feather him and ride
</p>
<p>him on a fence-rail!" Not knowing but that our turn
</p>
<p>would come next, and having left Major Williams in
</p>
<p>our office when we started to the depot to learn the
</p>
<p>news, we hastened back to our office, it being on Main
</p>
<p>Street, only about two squares from the depot, and reported to the major what had occurred at the depot.
</p>
<p>Being fearful that they might come to our office in
</p>
<p>search of him, in the event they went to his house and
</p>
<p>could not find him at home, as he frequently visited us,
</p>
<p>which was known by many, we proposed to him to
</p>
<p>spend the night with us, which offer he unhesitatingly
</p>
<p>accepted, and, conducting him through a back room
</p>
<p>out of our office and up two flights of stairs, he was
</p>
<p>soon ensconced in a warm bed in our dwelling, and
</p>
<p>thus spent the night. Major Williams was a Union
</p>
<p>man, and was subsequently arrested and confined in
</p>
<p>prison for at least six months, only having received
</p>
<p>his discharge in the month of October, 1862, being

</p>
<p>authorities arrested in Fredericksburg and lodged in
</p>
<p>the Old Capitol at Washington City. The major frequently visited us in Washington City after his release,
</p>
<p>during the time we remained there a refugee; and the
</p>
<p>story he relates of the sufferings of Union citizens
</p>
<p>while in prison is most revolting. We believe his
</p>
<p>report, because we know him to be a man of truth and
</p>
<p>perfectly reliable.
</p>
<p>We state this circumstance that the reader may
</p>
<p>be advised of the violent opposition and vindictive
</p>
<p>feelings which were manifested by secessionists towards
</p>
<p>Union men in Fredericksburg and throughout Virginia
</p>
<p>at least one month in advance of the election for the
</p>
<p>ratification or rejection of the ordinance of secession
</p>
<p>by the citizens of the State.
</p>
<p>In further evidence of the truth of our statements
</p>
<p>in this work, read the following correspondence from
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, Va., which we published in the number
</p>
<p>of the " Christian Banner" of April 25, 1861:"ANDY JOHNSON SALUTED IN LYNCHBURG.
</p>
<p>"LYNCHBURG, VA.-Andy Johnson, late United
</p>
<p>States Senator from Tennessee, passed through here today on his way from Washington to Tennessee. A large
</p>
<p>crowd assembled and groaned him and offered every
</p>
<p>indignity he deserved,-including pulling his nose.
</p>
<p>Every effort was made to take him off the cars.
</p>

<p>the populace. Johnson was protected by the conductor and others, who begged that he might be permitted to proceed home and let his own people deal
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>281
</p>
<p>with him. He denied sending a message asserting
</p>
<p>that Tennessee should furnish her quota of men."
</p>
<p>From the above the reader will discover that even
</p>
<p>United States Senators who were in favor of the
</p>
<p>Union could not pass through the State of Virginia to their homes and families in other States
</p>
<p>without being in danger of crowds of armed mobs
</p>
<p>offering every indignity and insult to them, including
</p>
<p>the pulling of their noses. They groaned him; they
</p>
<p>offered every indignity he deserved, including the
</p>
<p>pulling of his nose; every effort was made to take
</p>
<p>him off the cars. Why did Senator Johnson 9merit
</p>
<p>all this abuse? Simply because he was a patriot,
</p>
<p>loyal to his country. Why, or for what purpose,
</p>
<p>did they wish to take him off the cars, but to do
</p>
<p>violence to his person? Be it remembered that Tennesseeans were the first to make demonstrations of
</p>
<p>every sort of insult and to offer all kinds of indignities
</p>
<p>to United States Senators on Virginia soil. This was
</p>
<p>one of the great designs the Confederate authorities had
</p>
<p>in view in sending troops from other States into Virginia,-to make demonstrations of insults and to offer
</p>
<p>indignities to Union men. Why did not the military
</p>
<p>and civil authorities protect Senator Johnson? Because
</p>
<p>this would, perhaps, have thrown a damper on other
</p>
<p>large crowds, who subsequently might wish to offer
</p>
<p>insults and indignities to Union men. The conductor
</p>
<p>and others begged that he might be permitted to go
</p>
<p>home, and let his own people deal with him. Begged
</p>
<p>that a United States Senator might be permitted!
</p>
<p>permitted to go home! Great God! Was ever such
</p>
<p>insolence known? And that, too, in Old Virginia, " the

</p>
<p>Lynchburg! And all this damnable despotism was
</p>
<p>acted out in Virginia a month in advance of the vote
</p>
<p>of the people on the action of the convention.
</p>
<p>As we have already said, thousands of armed troops
</p>
<p>were sent from the seceded States to crush Virginia,to force her out of the Union,-to establish a military
</p>
<p>despotism over the people,-to awe them into servile submission to the infernal conspiracy of Davis and his band
</p>
<p>of traitors. This was the freedom, the independence,
</p>
<p>of the people of Virginia and of. the whole Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy. These were the men who denounced the
</p>
<p>despotism of the "Lincoln Government" and the "tyranny of the old infernal Union." These were the men
</p>
<p>who shouted against coercion,-who boasted of the
</p>
<p>liberty of the press, the liberty of speech, the liberty
</p>
<p>of action,-all of which simply meant that everybody
</p>
<p>had to write, speak, and act precisely in harmony with
</p>
<p>all that the original secessionists wrote, spoke, and did,
</p>
<p>and nothing else; and this wasfreedon! Yes, the freedom of slaves, the freedom of serfs,-and the only freedom exercised by the people -with impunity within the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy since its organization. God
</p>
<p>knows it, and the people in the Southern Confederacy
</p>
<p>know it, and they will tell the thrilling story to the
</p>
<p>world when the time comes. Talk about the "tyranny
</p>
<p>of the North," the "despotism of the Lincoln Government"! Where is greater despotism to be found this
</p>
<p>side of hell, than that which has been, and now is being,
</p>
<p>exercised over the poor, swindled, down-trodden people
</p>
<p>in the Southern Confederacy? Every vestige of freedom-every right and privilege-have been wrested

</p>
<p>283
</p>
<p>hell-deserving traitors presume to deliver lectures and
</p>
<p>write essays to and for the dear people, setting forth
</p>
<p>the horrors of the "despotism of the North,"-" the
</p>
<p>tyranny of the Lincoln Government,"-" the despotic
</p>
<p>Government of the Old Union"! Absolutely, men
</p>
<p>who have never been goaded by the curses of secession
</p>
<p>cannot sympathize with those who have. Secession is
</p>
<p>unmistakably the broad road and the wide gate which
</p>
<p>lead to destruction, and thousands there be who go in
</p>
<p>thereat. Secession is the shortest and most direct route
</p>
<p>to hell.
</p>
<p>Positively, secession is the most damnably aggravating
</p>
<p>curse by which mortals can be goaded this side of the
</p>
<p>infernal regions. Secessionists forced thepeople by the
</p>
<p>most terrible threats of every evil on earth, and that, too,
</p>
<p>at the point of the bayonet, to. go and vote for the ratification of the acts of the Virginia Convention, to the
</p>
<p>end that they might "hit them in the teeth with it" in all
</p>
<p>time to come. The leaders in this rebellion, who forced
</p>
<p>the people to submit to their will and pleasure, and who
</p>
<p>forced Virginia out of the Union, are themselves now
</p>
<p>submitting to the will and pleasure of their own slaves,
</p>
<p>and to many other things, of which they had never
</p>
<p>dreamed when, two years ago, they were anathematizing
</p>
<p>Union men and shouting hosannas to Jeff Davis, " King
</p>
<p>Cotton," and the everlasting "nigger." If they shall
</p>
<p>prove successful in ruining all others and the whole
</p>
<p>country, they themselves will be ruined in the end.
</p>
<p>This is right and just in the sight of all heaven. The
</p>
<p>leaders are the ones on whom the whole curse of this
</p>
<p>war should fall, if it were possible.

<p>CHAPTER XXIX.
</p>
<p>IN the " Banner" of April 25, 1861, we published
</p>
<p>the following editorial:"' DIABOLICAL WICIKEDNESS.
</p>
<p>"Having for months past anticipated with almost
</p>
<p>prophetic precision the inevitable results in the event
</p>
<p>of'certain contingencies,' we are in mind prepared to
</p>
<p>meet the very worst that can befall our country and
</p>
<p>our fellow-citizens.
</p>
<p>"We have for more than twelve months been warning our countrymen of the awful dangers ahead. The
</p>
<p>subject has borne with terrible weight upon our mind,
</p>
<p>both by day and by night, at home and abroad, in the
</p>
<p>sacred and secret retirements of life, and in the great
</p>
<p>congregation. Hence we are prepared to meet the
</p>
<p>very worst that can now come; and our constant and
</p>
<p>religious object in writing and conversing on this subject as we have done, was, and is, if possible, to so
</p>
<p>influence the actions of our countrymen as to avert
</p>
<p>civil war, and, consequently, all its train of horrors;
</p>
<p>and that, if we should ultimately fail to accomplish this
</p>
<p>object so devoutly wished, we might prepare the minds
</p>
<p>of our readers to look for the horrible calamities which
</p>
<p>must certainly befall them.

<p>to our country, we now feel in our heart that we have

<p>interested to the extent of. his earthly existence. If
</p>
<p>continued, it will result in a war of extermination, as

<p>we have always predicted. Can it not yet be arrested?

<p>the unhallowed and unbridled ambition of a few bloodthirsty tyrants and despots? Shall innocent females

<p>men, the flower and hope of our country, fall in one
</p>
<p>common ruin? What folly! what madness! what

<p>diabolical wickedness!"
</p>
<p>GENERAL REMARKS.
</p>
<p>The month of April, 1861, will ever be memorable
</p>
<p>in American history as recording the most thrilling
</p>
<p>events which have ever occurred on this great continent. In this month thousands of secesh fla8s were
</p>
<p>"thrown to the breeze" throughout the rebellious
</p>
<p>States; the "Stars and Stripes" were hauled down
</p>
<p>and made to trail in the dust; civil war was inaugurated at Charleston, South Carolina, by the Confederate
</p>
<p>troops firing on the "flag of the Union;" Fort Sumter
</p>
<p>was surrendered to the Confederate authorities by
</p>
<p>Major Anderson; the Virginia Convention passed an
</p>
<p>ordinance of secession, and sent commissioners to
</p>
<p>the Confederate Congress to tie Virginia on to the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy; Gosport NTavy-Yard and the
</p>
<p>Arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Va., were burned by the

<p>United States troops, and afterwards seized by the

<p>into servile submission to the arbitrary will of despots

<p>and tyrants; the reign of terror commenced, and the
</p>
<p>fate of Virginia was sealed, in April, 1861. Thus was
</p>
<p>Virginia environed on the 23d day of May, 1861, when
</p>
<p>the people of the State were called on, at the points of
</p>
<p>a hundred thousand bayonets, to vote for the ratification of the ordinance of secession which was passed by
</p>
<p>the Virginia Convention on the 18th of April, 1861.

<p>THE LAST EDITORIALS OF THE " CHRISTIAN BANNER" OF

<p>1861-GENERAL AND CLOSING REMARKS.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of May 9,
</p>
<p>1861, we published the following editorials:"THE PEOPLE OUGHT TO KNOW.

</p>
<p>who, when he sees danger approaching, cries,'Peace,
</p>
<p>peace and safety,' when there is neither peace nor safety,
</p>
<p>but sudden destruction at the door. If there be no
</p>
<p>danger, why, in the name of all that is sacred and
</p>
<p>humane, has our country been kept in a state of such
</p>
<p>unparalleled excitement for nearly six long months?
</p>
<p>If there be no danger of war, as some affect to believe,
</p>
<p>and if there never has been any danger, as others
</p>
<p>affirm, then we are forced to the conclusion that no age
</p>
<p>or country has ever been cursed with a class of such
</p>
<p>consummate knaves and fools as the political leaders
</p>
<p>in the farcical drama which is now being acted out in
</p>
<p>our wretchedly distracted country.
</p>
<p>"FDo the leaders presume upon the ignorance and
</p>
<p>credulity of thirty millions of freemen to effect their
</p>
<p>ambitious schemes to wriggle themselves into office,
</p>
<p>and to hold on to the offices they now fill?-now
</p>
<p>crying out,'War, war, war 1' until they create a sort
</p>
<p>of universal panic, which they keep up sufficiently long
</p>
<p>to accomplish their nefarious designs, and then trying to allay the excitement and calm the passions of
</p>
<p>the infuriated masses of the people by whispering in
</p>
<p>their ears,'Peace, peace.''There will be no war.''There is no danger of war.''We never thought
</p>
<p>there would be any war.'' All will be settled without
</p>
<p>the shedding of fraternal blood.' This is all unnecessary excitement,' &c. &c.'"Are freemen to be made slaves and brutes, to be
</p>
<p>gulled, duped, and led about by knaves whithersoever
</p>
<p>they wish? If there be no danger of war, then the
</p>
<p>leaders in this national, tragical affair justly merit the

<p>execrations of all good men on earth and all the hosts

</p>
<p>293
</p>
<p>the people ought to know it, and prepare themselves
</p>
<p>for the threatened calamities which are about to befall
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>" If an enemy designed to fire our house or to take
</p>
<p>our life, would we not be thankful to any one to forewarn
</p>
<p>us of the danger? Then we could prepare to meet it
</p>
<p>and defend ourself.'But the people ought not to be
</p>
<p>alarmed. There is no occasion for it.' No, no:' the
</p>
<p>people ought not to be alarmed:'tis all nonsense to
</p>
<p>talk about war, and frighten the people for nothing.'
</p>
<p>Ignorance may be bliss when and where there is no
</p>
<p>danger; but it may prove fatal when and where there
</p>
<p>is danger. Then we say to all our readers, there is
</p>
<p>danger,-imminent and immediate danger,-danger at
</p>
<p>any moment and everywhere. The people both in towns
</p>
<p>and country should be on their watch-towers both by
</p>
<p>day and by night, and every hour and every moment.'Tis wicked to act, in such times as the present, like
</p>
<p>silly boys walking in the night, whistling to keep each
</p>
<p>other's spirits up, all the time scared half to death for
</p>
<p>fear of seeing wandering ghosts from the'spirit-land.'
</p>
<p>"Danger has been forced upon us, and there is no
</p>
<p>concealing the fact any longer; and it would be unrighteous in us, as an editor, to cry,'Peace and safety,'
</p>
<p>when there is neither peace nor safety. We feel for
</p>
<p>our friends and fellow-citizens; and, because we do feel
</p>
<p>for them and love them and wish them well, we warn
</p>
<p>them to prepare themselves for coming danger. We
</p>
<p>have for more than twelve long months, and almost
</p>
<p>every week during that time, warned our readers that,
</p>
<p>in the event of'certain contingencies,' ruin, danger,
</p>
<p>and death await us in the future. These contingencies
</p>
<p>are wellnigh consummated; and we now say to one

<p>and all, prepare for the worst. Be not alarmed to
</p>
<p>madness, but to watchfulness, preparation, decision, and
</p>
<p>manly action when the time comes."
</p>
<p>"In the hour of danger, when our enemies are said
</p>
<p>to be near at hand, let every man stand firm to his
</p>
<p>post. No cowardly stampedes and sudden flights from
</p>
<p>danger. Cowards are generally great braggarts,
</p>
<p>making all sorts of'fuss and splutter' until the
</p>
<p>rumored approach of the enemy, and then they turn
</p>
<p>out to be great runners. For all such dastards we
</p>
<p>have the most supreme contempt. We have heard of
</p>
<p>men being spotted! Ay, we'll see who the brave
</p>
<p>souls are who merit spots! Brave men never run,cowards, always!
</p>
<p>"It is an easy matter for a few leaders to get a
</p>
<p>country into difficulties, but a very hard matter to get
</p>
<p>themselves and the country out of difficulties. A
</p>
<p>child can fire a house, which a whole community of
</p>
<p>men may not be able to rescue from the flames. Such
</p>
<p>is the present deplorable state and wretched fate of our
</p>
<p>now ruined, but once grand and magnificent, country.
</p>
<p>A few ambitious leaders have brought ruin upon us all,
</p>
<p>and the people quietly submit. After all that has been
</p>
<p>said of man, godlike man, what is he, but a compound
</p>
<p>of stupidity, treachery, ignorance, knavery, and cowardice, which are the principal constituents that compose the theological pill of total depravity!

<p>shame upon the boasted wisdom, philanthropy, patriotism, and Christianity of the American people!

<p>and ruin. Truly may it be said that we are at our

<p>us look to him, trusting in his almighty power and

<p>infinite wisdom and mercy to bring salvation out of

<p>think of the present condition of things around us, and

<p>of blood, could tears save our country from eternal

<p>GENERAL REMARKS.
</p>
<p>"Danger at any moment and everywhere."-We feared
</p>
<p>servile insurrections more than all the "army of the

<p>North." And we feel confident that before the close
</p>
<p>of this war, should it continue two or three years
</p>
<p>longer, the most fearful enemy with which the Southern people will have to contend will be the colored
</p>
<p>population of the South. Scenes, we fear, will be acted
</p>
<p>out which will horrify the souls of the bravest men.

<p>WVe tremble at the terrible reflection of what may be
</p>
<p>296
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>the fate of thousands of poor, unprotected females.
</p>
<p>WVhile the country is filled with armed troops, the
</p>
<p>slaves are awed into partial obedience. In communities, however, where thousands of them have been
</p>
<p>crowded together for "safe-keeping," and the most of
</p>
<p>the white men gone, and as most of them will either
</p>
<p>be killed, or die in the army with disease, then the
</p>
<p>slaves will seize their opportunity and scowl at the
</p>
<p>commands of their rulers, who for the most part will
</p>
<p>be females, boys, and old men; and then to attempt to
</p>
<p>coerce them into submission will be a fearful and
</p>
<p>hazardous undertaking. And let it be remembered,
</p>
<p>moreover, that the strength of the white men at the
</p>
<p>South is constantly being diminished, while that of the
</p>
<p>black population is constantly on the increase.
</p>
<p>" No danger."-To influence men to enlist for the war,
</p>
<p>secessionists at one time would cry, "War! war! war!"
</p>
<p>and then, again, they would denounce men as "fools"
</p>
<p>and "traitors" who dared to tell them that war was
</p>
<p>inevitable, and that there was danger at any moment
</p>
<p>and everywhere. They would create a panic and keep
</p>
<p>it up sufficiently long to effect their devilish purposes,
</p>
<p>and then try to calm the terrified feelings of the people
</p>
<p>by affirming to them that there would be no war. To
</p>
<p>justify them in their conclusions and assertions that
</p>
<p>there would be no war, they would advance "arguments" such as the following:"Virginia has seceded;" "The whole South is a
</p>
<p>unit;" "Every border State will certainly secede;"
</p>
<p>"The old Federal Government will break down;"
</p>
<p>"Lincoln has already shown the white feather;" "The

</p>
<p>may demand;" "All that is necessary is for men to
</p>
<p>enlist, and let the North see what an array of armed
</p>
<p>troops can be mustered into service, and then the
</p>
<p>North will become panic-stricken and yield to all the
</p>
<p>demands of the South, and the whole difficulty will be
</p>
<p>settled without any, or but very little, war," &c. &c.
</p>
<p>The game of deception which was practised upon the
</p>
<p>people of Virginia and the South was deep, dark, and
</p>
<p>iniquitous as hell itself. We saw this, and knew it to
</p>
<p>be the fact: hence the warning character of our editorials. We had been admonished for weeks either to
</p>
<p>change the character of our editorials, or to discontinue the publication of the "Banner." We would frequently prepare editorials with great care, and give
</p>
<p>them to the compositors, and, after being half in type,
</p>
<p>and sometimes entirely so, news would come and circumstances would occur which rendered it prudent,
</p>
<p>and absolutely necessary for our own safety, to suppress whole articles. It was a constant practice to
</p>
<p>write and re-write, to change and re-change and alter
</p>
<p>our editorials, as the young men in our office can
</p>
<p>testify.
</p>
<p>We saw and felt that the liberty of the press, the
</p>
<p>liberty of speech, and the rights of freemen were all
</p>
<p>wrested from us, and that the withdrawal of patronage
</p>
<p>would ultimately force us to discontinue the publication of the "Banner;" and we determined, after the publibation of the number of May 9, 1861, to close our
</p>
<p>office. We did so, and dismissed all our hands. We
</p>
<p>left our office with a heavy heart, determined never to
</p>
<p>resume the publication of our paper until the glorious
</p>
<p>"Stars and Stripes" should wave over us, which, we

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>reader cannot fail to observe, from the character of our
</p>
<p>editorials, that we grazed the brink of damnation as
</p>
<p>near as possible to escape tumbbling in.
</p>
<p>All the other printing-offices in Fredericksburgfour in number-continued to do an excellent business,
</p>
<p>as we were informed. On some occasions, as we were
</p>
<p>told, the editors received as much as five hundred dollars
</p>
<p>for one Government advertisement. Sometimes persons
</p>
<p>would tauntingly say to us, "A'n't you sorry you
</p>
<p>stopped your paper?" "If you had continued the'Banner,' you could now make your jack." "What a pity
</p>
<p>you stopped it " " Oh, I am so sorry for you!" &c. &c., 
</p>
<p>when, at the same time, their hearts were as destitute
</p>
<p>of true sympathy for us as a cinder thrown heavenhigh from the bottom of a burning volcano. Oh, what
</p>
<p>an amount of human depravity and damnable hypocrisy secession has developed! We could not conscientiously advocate the cause of traitors and treason, and
</p>
<p>we preferred being crushed by them rather than to
</p>
<p>join in with them to help crush our blessed country.
</p>
<p>We were entirely broken up in business of all kinds,
</p>
<p>and preferred to suffer rather than to hold any office
</p>
<p>in the Southern Confederacy, even if we could have
</p>
<p>obtained one by making the application. But such,
</p>
<p>however, were our Union proclivities and objectionable antecedents in opposing secession that we presume
</p>
<p>we could not have obtained an office even if we had
</p>
<p>asked for one. Thrown out of business, we remained
</p>
<p>an anxious observer of passing events until the arrival
</p>
<p>of the Union troops and the surrender of Fredericksburg, on the 18th of April, 1862. It was just one
</p>

<p>PART II.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of May
</p>
<p>9, 1862, we wrote the following editorials, which we
</p>
<p>publish as a continuation of the course of the "Banner,"
</p>
<p>and as a historical record of events which transpired
</p>
<p>during the stay of the Federal army in the town of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg, all of which will, no doubt, be more or
</p>
<p>less interesting to the reader. We shall make such
</p>
<p>notes of explanation from time to time as we may deem
</p>
<p>pertinent and proper.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>A SINGULAR coincidence in the history of the "Christian Banner" is, that we suspended the publication of
</p>
<p>it the 9th of May, 1861, and resumed its publication
</p>
<p>on the 9th of May, 1862. The following is a short
</p>
<p>article which we published in the first number, after
</p>
<p>the arrival of the Federal troops in Fredericksburg:"CHRISTIAN BANNER.
</p>

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>lMay 9, 1862, just one year to a day,-we again unfurl
</p>
<p>its sheet to the breeze. When we closed our office
</p>
<p>twelve months ago, the secessionz flag-the emblem of
</p>
<p>all folly-was waving over our city. To-day the
</p>
<p>_Americarz flag-the' Stars and Stripes,' the proud
</p>
<p>emblem of a nation's greatness, the flag which our
</p>
<p>fathers won through blood and death, the flag which
</p>
<p>our fathers loved, the flag which all nations honor,
</p>
<p>the flag under which we were born and have lived
</p>
<p>forty-five years save one-'now floats proudly over us.
</p>
<p>Long may it wave'over the land of the free and the
</p>
<p>home of the brave!' May it wave over 6us, our
</p>
<p>children, our grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren, down to the latest posterity, till Gabriel's
</p>
<p>trump shall sound and old Time shall end! Then
</p>
<p>good-bye, old time-honored flag! heaven is a better
</p>
<p>place than America.
</p>
<p>"We resume the publication of the'Christian
</p>
<p>Banner' because we feel it our duty to do all the possible good we can for our country and fellow-citizens.
</p>
<p>If we can only accomplish a single mite of good, our
</p>
<p>reward will be sure. We resume its publication because
</p>
<p>there is no other paper now published in our town
</p>
<p>nor all the surrounding country. Washington City
</p>
<p>and Richmond are the nearest points to us where any
</p>
<p>paper is published. The community needs a paper.
</p>
<p>Whether the people will patronize the'Banner' or not,
</p>
<p>we cannot tell. As we used to do in olden times, so
</p>
<p>shall we continue to do in the future; and that is, to
</p>
<p>write just as nearly what we please as circumstances
</p>
<p>will allow. One thing is certain and unmistakable;

<p>"THE CRISIS ON US."
</p>
<p>FooLs belch out nonsense and play the part of fuirious
</p>
<p>braggarts, spurning the admonitions of the wise and
</p>
<p>prudent. The maddening storm gathers blackness
</p>
<p>and darkness, and the deafening thunders burst over
</p>
<p>their heads, and the vivid lightnings play at their feet,
</p>
<p>before they cani see and feel the danger, or admit the
</p>
<p>propriety or necessity of seeking a place of refuge and
</p>
<p>security. Thus it is with thousands of poor deluded
</p>
<p>souls at the present time. The storm has been gathering for more than twelve long months, and the cry has
</p>
<p>constantly been, "There is no danger;" yet, when men
</p>
<p>dared to say that danger threatened them in the future,
</p>
<p>they were spotted, regarded as traitors, and eyed as suspicious characters,who " ought to be reported to the military
</p>
<p>authorities, arrested, and sent to Richmond to be tried,
</p>
<p>condemned, and executed for treason against the Southern Confederacy." The leaders in this terrible revolution have cried, "Peace and safety," when sudden destruction was at our very doors. If the leaders in this
</p>
<p>awful tragedy have knowingly and wilfully deceived
</p>
<p>the people, then they merit the unmitigated anathemas

</p>
<p>held up as brainless objects of pity, scorn, and contempt,
</p>
<p>to the whole civilized world, as blazing beacons to all
</p>
<p>stupid, unprincipled, political adventurers through all
</p>
<p>coming time.
</p>
<p>Who is so skeptical or stultified as to deny any
</p>
<p>longer the fact that the terribly awful anticipated
</p>
<p>crisis is actually upon us? Politicians swindled the
</p>
<p>people out of their rights, made slaves of them, and
</p>
<p>then promised to lead them to independence, freedom,
</p>
<p>prosperity, glory, honor, and national immortality.
</p>
<p>fave they done it? The wide world answers, no!
</p>
<p>Where is our independence? freedom? prosperity?
</p>
<p>glory? honor? national immortality? Ay, where are
</p>
<p>the brave, heroic leaders themselves? Politicians
</p>
<p>turned generals, and generals turned cowards, or have
</p>
<p>proven themselves totally incompetent to accomplish
</p>
<p>the mighty work they promised to perform.
</p>
<p>Not a single promise which the politicians made to
</p>
<p>the people has been met. In the science of political
</p>
<p>manceuvring and swindling they were accomplished
</p>
<p>proficients, but when they girded on the sword and
</p>
<p>went out to battle they proved themselves the veriest
</p>
<p>of dolts. With but few exceptions, what have they
</p>
<p>done? They have fallen back from place to place, and
</p>
<p>made so many surrenders that there are now but few
</p>
<p>more important points in the whole "Southern Confederacy" to yield.
</p>
<p>When our army fell back from Centreville and Fairfax Court-House to Manassas Junction, this was "a
</p>
<p>strategic move," indicating great military skill., to draw
</p>
<p>the enemy from his stronghold. And, subsequently,

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>305
</p>
<p>strategy. "Our generals know what they are doing.
</p>
<p>All is safe in their hands." Again, when our army fell
</p>
<p>back from Evansport, and from the whole line of the
</p>
<p>Potomac, to Fredericksburg, this was another "brilliant
</p>
<p>move of military strategy." Here a bold stand was to
</p>
<p>be made, and Fredericksburg was to be defended to the
</p>
<p>very last and at all hazards. And, finally, on the evermemorable morning of the 18th of April, 1862, when
</p>
<p>by military authority our bridges were burned, and the
</p>
<p>vessels of poor seamen were wrapped in flames, and the
</p>
<p>brave, heroic general fled for his life, carrying with him
</p>
<p>his whole army, leaving helpless citizens, unarmed men,
</p>
<p>defenceless women and children, to an unknown and
</p>
<p>uncared-for destiny, this was another magnificently
</p>
<p>grand, military "strategic move."
</p>
<p>Great God! Are men to be always deluded in this
</p>
<p>manner, forever following an ignis-fatuzts, to be dragged
</p>
<p>into the vortex of irretrievable ruin, and, as they plunge
</p>
<p>headlong into the black whirlpool of destruction unless
</p>
<p>they shout hosannas to the demon phantomn which
</p>
<p>caused their ruin, a thousand voices exclaim, " They are
</p>
<p>traitors, madmen, and ought to be damned!"
</p>
<p>Our generals have fled and carried the army with
</p>
<p>them; and by this act they declare that they could not
</p>
<p>protect us. If they could, why did they not stay and
</p>
<p>do it? They have left us to our own fate; and it now
</p>
<p>becomes us as, wise and prudent men, to act the part of
</p>
<p>freemen, and take care of ourselves as best we can.

<p>HEART-RENDING THOUGHT.
</p>
<p>HUNDREDS of wives and thousands of children, whose
</p>
<p>husbands and fathers have been forced into the war,
</p>
<p>are left wholly dependent on their own exertions for
</p>
<p>the scanty means of a wretched existence. What must

<p>be the mental agonies of those husbands and fathers
</p>
<p>when they reflect on the helpless and unknown condition of their wives and dear little children, who are far
</p>
<p>away, and no possible chance of seeing them, it may be,
</p>
<p>until the war shall have ended, and perhaps never

<p>again in this life? And what must be the painful reflections of these wives and mothers when they think
</p>
<p>of their dear husbands, and with sorrowing hearts and
</p>
<p>weeping eyes gaze on their poor little children, the
</p>
<p>whole responsibility of whose subsistence depends upon
</p>
<p>them? Wives are left worse than widows, and children worse than orphans. Who but fathers and mothers can feel the deep, heart-felt afflictions of those

</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>SECESSION LIKE THE DEVIL.
</p>
<p>IT is said that the devil was a liar from the beginning. If he were a liar from the beginning, he was a
</p>
<p>liar in the days of Jesus Christ, is a liar still, and will
</p>
<p>continue to be till the end of time. HIe lied to
</p>
<p>Eve in paradise, and she, influenced by his falsehood,
</p>
<p>sinned, and ruined the world. If the lies were all
</p>
<p>written in a book which the devil has told, the world
</p>
<p>itself would hardly be able to contain it. To say
</p>
<p>nothing more at present of the old devil, the father of
</p>
<p>lies, let us scan a few of the lies of the secession devil.
</p>
<p>1. That the Federal Government could be broken
</p>
<p>up, the Union dissolved, the old United States divided
</p>
<p>and two separate Governments formed out of them,
</p>
<p>without war and bloodshed.
</p>
<p>2. That if, by any possible chance, war should happen,
</p>
<p>it would commence between the Black Republicans and
</p>
<p>conservative men of the North, and would probably
</p>
<p>end there.
</p>
<p>3. That New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
</p>
<p>and Delaware would certainly unite their destinies with
</p>
<p>the South.
</p>
<p>4. That Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,
</p>
<p>and Missouri were all bound to secede, and would certainly go with the Gulf States. This was a fixedfact.
</p>
<p>5. That if, in the event of any possible contingency,

</p>
<p>there should be war, the South had men, munitions,
</p>
<p>308
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>and ample means of all kinds to prosecute it to a successful and glorious issue.
</p>
<p>6. That the North had neither fighting-men, money,
</p>
<p>nor means to commence and prosecute a war.
</p>
<p>7. That cotton was king, his throne was in the Gulf
</p>
<p>States, his empire the world, and that all the little
</p>
<p>kings and queens of the earth were bound to fall down
</p>
<p>and worship him.
</p>
<p>S. That the vexed question of African slavery would
</p>
<p>be hushed into eternal silence, and the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery settled upon a firm and immovable basis.
</p>
<p>9. That slave territory would be enlarged, and slave
</p>
<p>property would advance one hundred per cent.
</p>
<p>10. That England and France, and consequently all
</p>
<p>other civilized nations of the world, would certainly
</p>
<p>acknowledge the independence of the Southern Confederacy. This was, also, a fixed fact, bound to be
</p>
<p>done of necessity.
</p>
<p>11. That England and France would certainly raise
</p>
<p>the blockade; their interest would compel them to
</p>
<p>do it.
</p>
<p>12. That the Southern Confederacy would be the
</p>
<p>greatest Government in the world, and the citizens the
</p>
<p>most free, independent, wealthy, prosperous, and happy
</p>
<p>people on earth.
</p>
<p>All these, and many others, were the promises secession made to the Southern people. That they are all
</p>
<p>false, needs no argument: developed facts prove them
</p>
<p>so. By these fair promises the people of the South
</p>
<p>were deceived. They were swindled out of all their
</p>
<p>rights, as the sequel of this mournful tragedy will
</p>
<p>prove. Yes! for less than one mess of pottage the

</p>
<p>and the whole people plunged into a sea of sorrow,
</p>
<p>affliction, and death, the breadth and depth of which
</p>
<p>none but the all-penetrating eye of Omniscience can
</p>
<p>ever fathom. And yet, because we will not fall down
</p>
<p>and worship this demon-phantom, we must be spotted,
</p>
<p>and by ignorant, bigoted partisans branded as an
</p>
<p>enemy and traitor to the South. We are no enemy of
</p>
<p>the South; we are no traitor to the South. No. We
</p>
<p>love the South, and always have loved her; and because we love and always have loved the South, we
</p>
<p>always have, and do despise secession.
</p>
<p>We have always known, and ever maintained, that
</p>
<p>the only security the South and Southern institutions
</p>
<p>had, was contained in the provisions of the Federal
</p>
<p>Constitution. We are no traitor to the South. We
</p>
<p>indignantly spurn the base imputation, and pronounce
</p>
<p>it an unmitigated secession falsehood.
</p>
<p>The traitors and enemies of the South are the secession leaders of the South. Where are the men who
</p>
<p>fired up the Southern heart and precipitated this once
</p>
<p>glorious, independent, prosperous, and happy country
</p>
<p>into the present terrible revolution? Yes: where are
</p>
<p>they? Are they in the camp, with their knapsacks on
</p>
<p>their backs and muskets on their shoulders? Are they
</p>
<p>found lying side-by-side with the poor privates on the
</p>
<p>cold, wet ground? Are they performing the duties of
</p>
<p>poor private soldiers, exposed to all the dangers of
</p>
<p>camp-life, for the pitiful sum of eleven dollars per
</p>
<p>month? No. Their patriotism never pointed in that
</p>
<p>direction. With all their boasted patriotism and love
</p>
<p>of the South, they never intended to make such sacrifices to save her. Where are they? We answer, in

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>WHY DETHRONE REASON?
</p>
<p>WHY is it that men will suffer passion and prejudice
</p>
<p>to dethrone reason? Let us consider for a moment our
</p>
<p>present deplorable condition. Our generals and army
</p>
<p>have left us to the mercy of chance. Congress have
</p>
<p>broken up in a state of terrified confusion, and have
</p>
<p>gone to seek their own safety far from the seat of war,
</p>
<p>on their cotton, sugar, and rice plantations; the citizens of Richmond have become panic-stricken, and are
</p>
<p>leaving the city; the military and civil authorities are
</p>
<p>making preparations to burn the tobacco and public
</p>
<p>stores of the army, which have not been and cannot be
</p>
<p>sent away. These are facts, we presume, which are
</p>
<p>questioned by no one.
</p>
<p>Why is it that at this important crisis, when the
</p>
<p>lives of our dear sons and so many of our fellow-citizens are trembling on the very brink of eternity,
</p>
<p>the very men the leaders in this awful tragedy-fly
</p>
<p>before the advancing enemy? Why do they not stand
</p>
<p>and face the danger? Because conscience has made
</p>

</p>
<p>dear children butchered and slaughtered like wild
</p>
<p>beasts of the field, to gratify the unhallowed ambition
</p>
<p>of cowards, tyrants, and traitors? Can and will freemen submit to such an outrage? No: surely they will

<p>not. Then let us demand our children; let us call
</p>
<p>them home, and let Jeff Davis and his clique go to the

<p>Clique.-By clique we mean the Cabinet and the

<p>ringleaders who were associated with Jeff Davis in his

<p>REFLECTIONS.
</p>
<p>SADNESS fills our heart, and tear-drops fill our eyes,
</p>
<p>when we look back on the past, scan the present, and
</p>
<p>take a peep into the dark, mysterious future. Memory
</p>
<p>brings up all the hallowed associations of the past, and
</p>
<p>forces a contrast with the present, while sorrow fills the
</p>
<p>soul, and we are made to exclaim, "0 God, what is
</p>
<p>man, that thou shouldst regard him, or the son of man,
</p>
<p>that thou shouldst visit him?"
</p>
<p>But two years ago, what a happy people we were, in
</p>
<p>the full enjoyment of all blessings, earthly and divine,
</p>
<p>that an honest and grateful people could have desired.

</p>
<p>313
</p>
<p>possession of their homes, their political, social, civil,
</p>
<p>and religious rights. Freedom of thought, freedom of
</p>
<p>speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of action
</p>
<p>were the pride and boast of every American citizen.
</p>
<p>Every man could think what he pleased, speak what he
</p>
<p>pleased, write what he pleased, do what he pleased, go
</p>
<p>where he pleased, and come when he pleased, and no
</p>
<p>one dared to oppose, unless he acted in violation of the
</p>
<p>civil laws of his country.
</p>
<p>Families were happy. Husbands and wives, parents
</p>
<p>and children, brothers and sisters, were happy in their
</p>
<p>quiet, peaceful homes. Homesteads, churches, and the
</p>
<p>groves were vocal with the praises of God. The millennium, or a thousand years' reign of Christ upon the
</p>
<p>earth with the faithful, was strongly anticipated by
</p>
<p>many. A nation's heart beat with joy and gladness
</p>
<p>inexpressible. We were a happy people,-a nation
</p>
<p>blessed above all the nations of the earth. No, never,
</p>
<p>since God conducted his own chosen Israel into the land
</p>
<p>of Canaan, has any people or nation of the whole earth
</p>
<p>been blessed as have been the American people.
</p>
<p>How changed are all things now! Many of our
</p>
<p>finest farms are uncultivated,-fences are destroyed,
</p>
<p>and the fields are made desolate and have become the
</p>
<p>camping-ground of soldiers. The tap of the. drum,
</p>
<p>the martial music of bands, the tents of the warrior,
</p>
<p>now fall upon our ear and meet our eye at almost every
</p>
<p>point. Men fly from their homes as from deadly
</p>
<p>poison, leaving all their interests to chance and blind
</p>
<p>fatality. Political, social, civil, and religious rights
</p>
<p>are no longer respected. Freedom of opinion, speech,
</p>
<p>the press, and action is no longer the pride and boast
</p>
<p>of freemen. Mlen are now afraid to express their

<p>opinions, simply because they are no longer freemen.
</p>
<p>The freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the
</p>
<p>freedom of action, are all suppressed; and men who
</p>
<p>once boasted of their freedom and bravery now quail
</p>
<p>and writhe under the lash of military despotism. How
</p>
<p>are the mighty fallen, and the strong made to tremble!
</p>
<p>This is no fiction. Stern realities stare us full in the
</p>
<p>face, and we must meet them, whether we wish to do
</p>
<p>so or not.
</p>
<p>Families are no longer happy. Husbands are torn
</p>
<p>from their wives, fathers from their children, and sons
</p>
<p>from their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and
</p>
<p>homes. The once peaceful, quiet, and happy homes
</p>
<p>of thousands are either forsaken and left desolate, or
</p>
<p>changed into habitations of weeping, mourning, and
</p>
<p>deep lamentation. The homesteads and churches of
</p>
<p>thousands, and the groves, are no longer vocal with
</p>
<p>the praises of God. The millennium, or reign of
</p>
<p>Christ a thousand years with his people on earth, is no

<p>longer immediately anticipated. A nation's heart is

<p>made to bleed.

</p>
<p>more gloomy appearance of things could hardly be presented. Places of business, with few exceptions, are
</p>
<p>everywhere closed up, and men walk about the streets
</p>
<p>as if in constant expectation of hearing the last shrill
</p>
<p>note of Gabriel's awful trump. Many private residences are closed and forsaken, and families have deserted their quiet, peaceful homes, to become refugees
</p>
<p>and sufferers among strangers in other parts of our
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>Horticulture, to a great extent, is neglected; while
</p>
<p>all are reposing in a state of idleness and inexplicable
</p>
<p>suspense, wondering when, and where, and how the
</p>
<p>scene will end. An indescribable panic has seized all
</p>
<p>classes of our once brave, happy, industrious, and
</p>
<p>prosperous people. What must be the end of all this?
</p>
<p>There can be but one answer to this question if things
</p>
<p>continue thus, and that is, starvation and death will be
</p>
<p>the inevitable result.
</p>
<p>Hence we would say to one and all of our fellowcitizens, go to work! Up and at it! Attend more
</p>
<p>strictly to business than ever, because there is greater
</p>
<p>need than there has ever been at any former period
</p>
<p>of our lives. What is the use for men to become disheartened, and give up the ghost, and die before the
</p>
<p>time comes? If men refuse to work, nothing can be
</p>
<p>produced; and if nothing be produced, people must
</p>
<p>starve.
</p>
<p>Gazing at soldiers, listening to martial music, and
</p>
<p>following the army about will never make the " pot
</p>
<p>boil." The duty and business of soldiers is one thing,
</p>
<p>and the duty and business of citizens is another thing.
</p>
<p>Soldiers consume, and citizens produce; if, therefore,

</p>
<p>diers must ultimately starve. Soldiers, however, have
</p>
<p>this decided advantage over citizens: the former are
</p>
<p>fed and clothed from the public crib, while the latter
</p>
<p>have to look after their own food and raiment. Armies
</p>
<p>must and will be supported, provided the produce is to
</p>
<p>be had, and citizens can only get the excess after
</p>
<p>armies are supplied. This fact, of itself, is sufficient
</p>
<p>to rouse every one to action, and stimulate all to do
</p>
<p>their utmost. Then we would admonish all, old and
</p>
<p>young, male and female, high and low, rich and poor,
</p>
<p>bond and free, to go to work, and work for life, or

<p>famine and death will be the result.

<p>THE CONFEDERATE ARMY LEAVES FREDERICKSBURG,

<p>ON the morning of the 18th of April, 1862, the Confederate Army evacuated the town of Fredericksburg,
</p>
<p>leaving the citizens to share whatever fate might
</p>
<p>chance to befall them. Never, perhaps, did any army

<p>leave a place with greater expedition than did our

<p>army leave the venerable old town of Fredericksburg.

<p>than one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars'
</p>
<p>worth of vessels was destroyed, to say nothing about
</p>
<p>the vast amount of grain and other property consumed
</p>
<p>in them, all of which will, probably, prove in the end
</p>
<p>a total loss to the owners.
</p>
<p>Admitting the fact that the burning of the bridges
</p>
<p>was " a military necessity,"-which we very much question,-we utterly ignore the idea that the burning of
</p>
<p>the vessels was; and, while no good to the Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy, and but little if any injury to the enemy,
</p>
<p>could possibly result from an act so outrageously cruel,
</p>
<p>it has reduced at least some of the owners of the vessels
</p>
<p>to a state of almost total bankruptcy. Some of these men
</p>
<p>have labored and toiled for years, and by rigid economy
</p>
<p>had succeeded in accumulating sufficient amounts to
</p>
<p>purchase vessels, and their all of earthly goods was
</p>
<p>invested in them, and in a single hour they behold the
</p>
<p>hard earnings of many years reduced to ashes. What
</p>
<p>a pity! What a shame!
</p>
<p>In connection with the burning of the bridges and
</p>
<p>vessels, we would state that from fifteen to twenty
</p>
<p>thousand dollars' worth of cotton was also burnt, which
</p>
<p>might have been saved, had not such a terrible panic
</p>
<p>seized the managers of the cars.
</p>
<p>We witnessed the burning of the bridges and vessels,
</p>
<p>and, truly, the scene was one of melancholy sublimity.
</p>
<p>May we never again witness such reckless, wanton,
</p>
<p>wicked destruction of property! On the 18th day of

<p>PURSUANT to orders of Brigadier-General Patrick,

<p>on Wednesday, the 7th of May, 1862, the Southern
</p>
<p>Tier Rifles, 23d New York Volunteers, Colonel H. C.
</p>
<p>Hoffman commanding, took up its line of march from
</p>
<p>camp near Falmouth, for the occupation of Fredericksburg, arriving in the city at nine o'clock A.M. Such
</p>
<p>respectful regard was paid to the sensitiveness of the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of our town as to dispense with the martial
</p>
<p>music usual upon such occasions, the regiment marching
</p>
<p>silently to its quarters, with fine and soldierly bearing.
</p>
<p>Companies were immediately detailed and despatched
</p>
<p>to outposts guarding the various approaches to the

<p>town.
</p>
<p>The officers of this regiment, field, staff, and line,

<p>are gentlemen of the highest respectability and of

<p>dignified and courteous demeanor; and such has been

<p>rights and privileges, the protection of private property, and the unrestricted conduct and continuance of

<p>the accustomed business pursuits and avocations of our:

<p>May, 1862, exactly two weeks to a day from the evacuation of the town by the Confederate forces. The

</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of May

<p>17, 1862, we published the following editorials:"RBEBELLION AND STUBBORNNESS.
</p>
<p>"Holy writ says, and says nothing more true, that'Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.' Saint Paul says,' Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For
</p>
<p>there is no power but of God; the powers that be are
</p>
<p>ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the
</p>
<p>power resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that
</p>
<p>resist shall receive to themselves damnation.'
</p>
<p>"This is the language of inspiration. What does it
</p>
<p>mean? Let us see.
</p>
<p>"Dr. MacKnight says,'The government of every
</p>
<p>State, whether it be monarchical, aristocratical, democratical, or mixed, is as really of divine appointment
</p>
<p>as the government of the Jews was, though none but
</p>
<p>the Jewish form was of divine legislation. God having
</p>
<p>designed mankind to live in society, he has, by the
</p>
<p>frame of their nature, and by the reason of things, authorized government, to be exercised in every country.

<p>he has left it to the people to choose what form is most
</p>
<p>agreeable to themselves, and to commit the exercise of
</p>
<p>the supreme power to what persons they think fit.
</p>
<p>And, therefore, whatever form of government hath been
</p>
<p>chosen or is established in any country hath the divine sanction; and the persons who, by the choice, or
</p>
<p>even by the peaceable submission, of the governed, have
</p>
<p>the reins of government in their hands, are the lawful
</p>
<p>sovereigns of that country, and have all the rights and

<p>prerogatives belonging to sovereignty vested in their

<p>persons.
</p>
<p>"'Wherefore, since the power of which the apostle
</p>
<p>speaks is the form of government, and not the rulers
</p>
<p>of a country, the subjection to the higher powers enjoined is not an unlimited passive obedience to rulers
</p>
<p>in things sinful, but an obedience to the wholesome
</p>
<p>laws enacted for the good of the community by common consent, or by those who, according to the constitution of the State, have the power of enacting laws.
</p>
<p>To these good laws the people are to give obedience,
</p>
<p>without examining by what title the magistrates who
</p>
<p>execute these laws hold their power, and even without considering whether the religion professed by the
</p>
<p>magistrates be true or false. For the same reason, the
</p>
<p>opposition to and resistance of the power forbidden is
</p>
<p>an opposition to and resistance of the established government, by disobeying the wholesome laws of the State,

<p>"By the wholesome provisions embraced in this Constitution, our fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers,
</p>
<p>and we, their descendants, have been and were protected in our persons, and rights of all kinds, and were
</p>
<p>prosperous and happy,-enjoying all the blessings heart
</p>
<p>could wish,-until an ill-natured faction attempted the
</p>
<p>overthrow of this Government.

<p>"The idea that a set of ambitious, disappointed politicians could destroy the Constitution framed by the
</p>
<p>clearest heads and purest hearts the world has ever
</p>
<p>known since the days of the apostles of Jesus Christ,
</p>
<p>or make such improvements on it as virtually to annihilate it, is an instance of political egotism without a

<p>parallel in the history of the world. It is absolutely

<p>as ridiculous as if a school-boy, who has just learned to

<p>should attempt to improve on the beauties and elegancies:of Homer or Virgil. The effort was made,

<p>however, and the result has proven a failure,  the

<p>ruin of all!

<p>anathemas of millions be heaped upon the very names
</p>
<p>and ashes of the leaders in this horribly wicked revolution.
</p>
<p>"A faction of politicians, whose motto was, rule or
</p>
<p>ruin, met in secret convention, concocted all their plans,
</p>
<p>determined at all hazards to carry them into effect,
</p>
<p>created and signed an ordinance of secession, and then
</p>
<p>told their people, and published to the world, that the
</p>
<p>State had seceded. And for what cause was all this
</p>
<p>done?' Not because Abraham Lincoln was elected to
</p>
<p>the Presidency of the United States;' not because of
</p>
<p>the passage of the'personal liberty bills.' No; but
</p>
<p>because they had desired, and had been endeavoring
</p>
<p>for more than thirty years, to overthrow the Federal
</p>
<p>Government, to dissolve the blessed Union, cemented
</p>
<p>by the sweat and blood of our ancestors,-in order to
</p>
<p>establish a Government in harmony with their own ambitious views, and in which they could rule and govern.
</p>
<p>"The border States were to be dragged into the same
</p>
<p>political whirlpool of destruction. How was this to be
</p>
<p>done? By political intrigue. By a right-down swindle. At least, this was the way Virginia was carried

<p>out of the Union. Let us see.

</p>
<p>the perfect understanding that they were to take into
</p>
<p>consideration the policy or impolicy of passing an ordinance of secession; and the final result of their deliberations was to be referred back to the people. That convention met in Richmond; and it is useless to say
</p>
<p>how long it remained in session before an ordinance of
</p>
<p>secession was passed. Every outside pressure possible
</p>
<p>was brought to bear upon it. The Legislature of Virginia was in session during the whole time; and, if not
</p>
<p>all, a large majority of the members of the Legislature
</p>
<p>were rampant secessionists. And, finally, a secret
</p>
<p>secession convention of select, simon-pure secessionists
</p>
<p>was called, with which the people of Virginia had
</p>
<p>nothing to do,-not being allowed even the privilege
</p>
<p>of knowing why and for what it was called. In the
</p>
<p>mean time, an orator from Virginia visited Charleston,
</p>
<p>South Carolina; and the object of that mission our
</p>
<p>readers must divine. Secessionists began to despair
</p>
<p>as to the result of the Virginia Convention. At length,
</p>
<p>however, the news flew over the telegraph-wires that
</p>
<p>Fort Sumter had fallen. Cannons were fired. Speeches
</p>
<p>were made all over the town. Loud huzzas rent the
</p>
<p>air, and the'tiger groans,' like the hollow mutterings
</p>
<p>of devils damned coming up from the lowest depths
</p>
<p>of perdition, sounded the death-knell of Virginia in
</p>
<p>our ears. All was over. Now, any man who dared
</p>
<p>to speak a word in favor of the Union was a blackhearted traitor to Virginia and the South, a downright
</p>
<p>Abolitionist, a Lincolnite, and ought to be driven out of
</p>
<p>the country or hung.
</p>

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>following Tuesday, the 16th of April, 1861, the secret
</p>
<p>secession convention met in Richmond, and on Wednesday, the 17th of April, 1861, the Virginia Convention went into secret session, and on Thursday, the
</p>
<p>18th of April, 1861, the Virginia Convention passed
</p>
<p>the ordinance of secession, which sealed the fate, the
</p>
<p>downfall, of the greatest State in the Union.
</p>
<p>"The action of the convention was yet to come
</p>
<p>before the people. All were urged to go to the polls
</p>
<p>and vote, and present a bold front to the North, and
</p>
<p>thus prevent war and secure peace. Those who had
</p>
<p>been Union men, if they voted the secession ticket and
</p>
<p>professed conversion to the glorious doctrine of secession, were to be marked as hypocrites. If they remained at home and refused to vote, they were traitors,
</p>
<p>and should be spotted; a seal of black reprobation was
</p>
<p>to be stamped on them and on their children through all
</p>
<p>coming time. If they voted for the Union, they were
</p>
<p>Abolitionists, and ought to be driven out of Virginia,
</p>
<p>and out of the whole South, or hung with a'grapevine.'
</p>
<p>" It was likewise urged that, because the vote in the
</p>
<p>convention was almost unanimous,-there being only
</p>
<p>an insignificant minority of about six or seven votes,
</p>
<p>four of whom voted against the ordinance, and one, perhaps, was sick, one or two being absent who would have
</p>
<p>voted for secession if they had been present,-therefore
</p>
<p>the entire people of the State ought, by all means, to vote
</p>
<p>for the ratification of the action of the convention. But
</p>
<p>when the injunction of secrecy was removed from the
</p>
<p>doings of that convention in June following, and the
</p>
<p>facts were developed, there were upwards of forty-Jive

<p>sion at all. And yet we were told that it was almost a
</p>
<p>unanimous vote. This was a political swindle.
</p>
<p>"Nor was this all. The convention, instead of
</p>
<p>adjourning and letting the people at once decide the
</p>
<p>question for themselves, sent Congressmen to Montgomery, Alabama, and tied Virginia on to the Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy before the people of the State had voted
</p>
<p>on the question at all. This called forth the following
</p>
<p>remarks from our pen, which appeared in the' Christian Banner' of May 2, 1861, next to the last number
</p>
<p>we published:"'Is it not an alarming usurpation of authority that
</p>
<p>the Virginia Convention should have appointed gentlemen to the Congress of the Confederate States at all?
</p>
<p>Was this the purpose for which the Virginia Convention was called? We did not so understand it. Is it
</p>
<p>not an alarming usurpation of power that the Virginia
</p>
<p>Convention should unite the destiny of the Old Dominion with the Confederate States of America, before the
</p>
<p>vote of the citizens of the State is taken on the question? Are a million of freemen to be bartered and
</p>
<p>sold, and handed over to other authorities without being
</p>
<p>consulted, and without their knowledge or consent,
</p>
<p>by a convention of men elected by the people to transact other and different matters? If we understood the
</p>
<p>subject, the convention was called together to decide
</p>
<p>on the policy of passing an ordinance of secession or
</p>
<p>non-secession; after which the action of the convention
</p>
<p>was to be referred back to the sovereign people for their

<p>ratification or rejection. The whole matter is prearranged and virtually fixed, and then the people are

<p>be the beginning of our new order of things, what
</p>
<p>will the end be?'
</p>
<p>"These are facts which every citizen of intelligence
</p>
<p>in this community knows to be true. And because we
</p>
<p>exposed the system of wicked swindling, the political
</p>
<p>cheat imposed upon the people, we were admonished to'beware how and what we wrote.' We had been
</p>
<p>treated with indignity, and insulted beyond measure,
</p>
<p>more than a month before this, when, in justice to ourself and to the Union men in Fredericksburg, we spoke
</p>
<p>at a public meeting in the court-house, where a powerful effort was made to raise a mob and break up
</p>
<p>the meeting. The conduct of our opponents on that
</p>
<p>occasion beggars all description; and while we were
</p>
<p>addressing our fellow-citizens, and warning them of the
</p>
<p>awful dangers ahead if Virginia should secede, some
</p>
<p>one in the crowd threw an egg at us; but, knowing and
</p>
<p>feeling that we were pleading for the interest of our
</p>
<p>fellow-citizens and for the salvation of our country,
</p>
<p>we silently endured the insult, treating it with contempt. All this happened more than a month before
</p>
<p>Virginia seceded. In the mean time, before the day of
</p>
<p>election arrived, when the action of the convention
</p>
<p>was to come before the people for their approval or disapproval, thousands on thousands of troops from the
</p>
<p>seceded States came pouring into Virginia and were
</p>
<p>stationed in most of the cities and towns in the State.
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg was literally filled with them.
</p>
<p>"The day of election came, and we had determined
</p>
<p>not to vote, nor go to the court-house at all. During

<p>the day, however, one of our prominent citizens, and an

</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>329
</p>
<p>to tell us, frankly, candidly, and most sincerely as a
</p>
<p>true friend, that, unless we went and voted for the
</p>
<p>ratification of the action of the convention, our standing, influence, and all our prospects even for living in
</p>
<p>the community, were blighted and blasted forever, and
</p>
<p>we would be called a traitor, and a tory, and that in
</p>
<p>years to come it would be thrown up to our children,
</p>
<p>&c. &c., as it was in the old Revolutionary War; and
</p>
<p>therefore,' for the sake of your churches, all of which
</p>
<p>are in the South,-for the sake of your friends, of whom
</p>
<p>you have many,-for the sake of your children, and
</p>
<p>children's children, in years to come,-and for your own
</p>
<p>sake, standing, and influence, and very existence, in
</p>
<p>Virginia and the South,' &c. &c.,-' go and vote.'
</p>
<p>Knowing that our vote could effect nothing either the
</p>
<p>one way or the other, so far as the destiny of Virginia
</p>
<p>was concerned, late in the evening we went to the
</p>
<p>court-house, and stated to the commissioners that we
</p>
<p>were no convert to secession, that we despised secession,
</p>
<p>but that we were in Virginia, and would go with Virginia, and that if they considered this a vote they could
</p>
<p>take it. Immediately they called out our name, and
</p>
<p>cried out,'Ratification.'
</p>
<p>"Since the day -of election for the ratification of Virginia's secession, what have we either said or done to
</p>
<p>cause any one, however stupid, to think that we had
</p>
<p>changed our views on the subject of secession? Have
</p>
<p>we delivered any secession speeches? No. Have we
</p>
<p>prayed any secession prayers? God knows we have
</p>
<p>not! Have we argued the cause of secession? No.
</p>
<p>Have we asked for any office, or for any situation of

<p>any kind, in the Southern Confederacy? No, we have

<p>not. Have we not uniformly said to all persons, at all

<p>times, and in all places, at home and abroad, on the
</p>
<p>streets, in the stores, and everywhere and always, that
</p>
<p>we despised secession, and that because we felt a
</p>
<p>devotion for the South which no blind secessionist could
</p>
<p>feel, therefore we opposed secession?
</p>
<p>"What have we done? We have been slanderously
</p>
<p>reported as having held secret Union meetings for the
</p>
<p>purpose of plotting treason against the Southern Confederacy. This is infamously false. We have been
</p>
<p>treated with indignity, and attempts have been made
</p>
<p>by certain characters to insult us, who were themselves
</p>
<p>beneath contempt. We have been meanly and basely
</p>
<p>slandered both at home and abroad, simply because we
</p>
<p>used our best efforts to save the South from ruin. And
</p>
<p>now we are threatened with a rope, if ever the time
</p>
<p>comes and an opportunity is offered.
</p>
<p>" What have we done? We opened a private boarding-house last winter, as a matter of necessity, to keep
</p>
<p>from starvation. We treated the poor soldiers the
</p>
<p>very best we could: we did this because we were sorry
</p>
<p>for them; we did it for their sake,-for the sake of
</p>
<p>their parents and friends; we did it for the sake of
</p>
<p>their wives and children, many of them being men of
</p>
<p>families; we did it for the sake of humanity and our
</p>
<p>common Christianity; and we feel sorry that we were
</p>
<p>not able to do more for them and better by them than
</p>
<p>what we did. This is our inconsistency; this our disloyalty to the South; this our treason. This is what

<p>we have done.

<p>it has opened a fountain of sorrow, affliction, woe, and

<p>The Confederate States seceded from the Union to'get their rights,' and the negroes are seceding from
</p>
<p>their masters to'enjoy their right,' and the desolating

<p>in their reckless course of ruin is simply this:-' What!

<p>333
</p>
<p>submit to old Abe Lincoln?'' Submit to be ruled andl
</p>
<p>governed by an old Abolition rail-splitter!'' Submit to
</p>
<p>Black Republican rule!'' Never! never! never!''We'll die, every man of us, first.' This was an irrefragable argument. No one in all the schools of common-sense philosophy could be found wise enough to
</p>
<p>confute it.
</p>
<p>"Who had to submit to Lincoln? What government had Lincoln? What power had he more than
</p>
<p>was guaranteed to him by the Constitution, as Chief
</p>
<p>Magistrate of the United States? None whatever.
</p>
<p>If all the States had remained quietly and peaceably in the Union, Lincoln could not have inaugurated
</p>
<p>a civil war upon the South. This was a constitutional
</p>
<p>impossibility. The Federal Government never inaugurated war upon the South. South Carolina and
</p>
<p>the seceded States inaugurated civil war upon the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, or upon the Government of the
</p>
<p>United States. This is a fact which will go down in
</p>
<p>history to the latest generation of American citizens.

<p>" But let us examine and see who are the submissionists. The people of South Carolina submitted to Messrs.

<p>Rhett, Keitt, Boyce & Co. Mississippi submitted to
</p>
<p>South Carolina. Alabama submitted to South Carolina
</p>
<p>and Mississippi. Georgia and Florida submitted to

<p>these three, and Louisiana and Texas submitted to
</p>
<p>these five cotton States, making seven; and these seven

<p>cotton States seceded, not by the popular vote of the

<p>people of these States, but by conventions; and theser

<p>and they had to submit. Then this Montgomery Convention empowered the conventions of the seven revolted cotton States to appoint members to form a
</p>
<p>Congress for the purpose of enacting laws by which to
</p>
<p>move and work the grand machinery of this new order
</p>
<p>of things. All this was done independently of the
</p>
<p>popular voice of the people of these States. There was
</p>
<p>no submission in all this, was there? Were there no
</p>
<p>Union men in all these seven cotton States, while these
</p>
<p>things were being acted out? What did they do?
</p>
<p>What could they do but submit to the arbitrary will
</p>
<p>and yield submission to the military power of this selfconstituted body?
</p>
<p>"Has not Virginia yielded in humble submission,
</p>
<p>through the intrigue of her leaders, to the confederacy
</p>
<p>of the seven cotton States? Yes: through the treachery
</p>
<p>of her State Legislature and State Convention, Virginia was forced out of the Union on the 18th (as they
</p>
<p>say) of April, 1861, and was immediately tied on to
</p>
<p>the seven cotton-States Confederacy, and Richmond
</p>
<p>city, Virginia, was determined on as the capital of the
</p>
<p>2,nuthern Confederacy, and Jeff Davis and his army

<p>of Virginia, on the day of voting for the ratification of
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>335
</p>
<p>the ordinance of secession, which took place on the 23d
</p>
<p>day of May, 1861, more than one month from the time
</p>
<p>of the passage of the ordinance of secession. And on
</p>
<p>the day of election, as we have stated in our editorials
</p>
<p>of a former number of the'Banner,' all the principal
</p>
<p>cities, towns, and villages in Virginia were literally
</p>
<p>filled with soldiers. And not only so, but civil war was
</p>
<p>inaugurated in Virginia before the day of election for
</p>
<p>the ratification or non-ratification of the acts of the
</p>
<p>convention. Gosport Navy-Yard was seized, and the
</p>
<p>Arsenal at Harper's Ferry was burned, before the day
</p>
<p>of election. All this was planned and executed for the
</p>
<p>purpose of forcing Virginia into submission to secession
</p>
<p>rule, intrigue, and treachery. So that at least a majority of some sixty or seventy thousand voters in the
</p>
<p>State of Virginia had at last to bow at the point of
</p>
<p>the bayonet in humble submission to the will, purpose,
</p>
<p>determination, and domination of a few leaders in the
</p>
<p>cotton States,'away down South in Dixie.'
</p>
<p>"This is submission, with a tyrant's rod and a vengeance. And all who were opposed to secession have
</p>
<p>been forced to submit, because a military despotism has
</p>
<p>been hanging over them ever since; and this isfreedom,
</p>
<p>-independence!
</p>
<p>"Submission! Are not the very men who indignantly
</p>
<p>spurned the idea of submission to the constituted authorities of their country now submitting to the greatest imaginable indignities from their own servants?
</p>
<p>Masters have set the ungodly example of non-submission
</p>
<p>to the'higher powers, that be ordained of God,' and
</p>
<p>their servants have caught the cue, and swear that
</p>
<p>they will no longer submit to the rule of their masters.

<p>Why do masters submit to the reckless insubordination
</p>
<p>336
</p>
<p>THE. CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>of their slaves? For the same reason that Union men,
</p>
<p>twelve months ago, had to submit to the will and dictation of secessionists:-simply because they can't help
</p>
<p>themselves; and hence anarchy reigns rampant everywhere, and among all classes, all over the country.
</p>
<p>Great God! to what a queer state of affairs our country
</p>
<p>is reduced. Secessionists will not submit to be governed
</p>
<p>by the'Constitution of the United States,' and Union
</p>
<p>men will not submit to be governed by the Constitution
</p>
<p>of the'Confederate States;' and servants refuse to
</p>
<p>be governed by the legal authority of their masters.
</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a terrible state of insubordination. We
</p>
<p>knew from the beginning that secession would inevitably produce this state of things; and therefore we
</p>
<p>opposed it. And because we did and do oppose it, we
</p>
<p>are branded as an enemy to the South. How blindly,
</p>
<p>how wickedly false!
</p>
<p>"In proof that Virginia was forced out of the Union
</p>
<p>by the acts of the civil and military leaders of secession, we need no stronger evidence than the suppression
</p>
<p>of the publication of the popular vote of the citizens of
</p>
<p>Virginia. Who can tell the number of votes actually
</p>
<p>polled by citizens of Virginia for the ratification of the
</p>
<p>ordinance of secession? This is a question of grave importance, which we submit to the leading secessionists
</p>
<p>of Virginia. Still, the people must submit. This is
</p>
<p>submission.
</p>
<p>"Nor is this all. When the people of Virginia were
</p>
<p>called upon, this spring, to go into a mock-election for a
</p>
<p>President of the Southern Confederacy, they were told
</p>
<p>that it would be bad policy to have two candidates in
</p>
<p>this early stage of our Government, and, moreover, that

<p>war-times was no time to be discussing politics, and
</p>
<p>THE SOUTHI SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>337
</p>
<p>therefore all the voters of Virginia ought to go to
</p>
<p>the polls and vote for Jeff Davis. Who can tell what
</p>
<p>was the number of votes polled? The people of
</p>
<p>Virginia ought to know this. We were urged to go to
</p>
<p>the polls and vote; but we did not. Why should we?
</p>
<p>Had there been but ten votes cast in the whole State,
</p>
<p>or in the whole South, Jeff Davis would still have remained President of the Southern Confederacy.
</p>
<p>"' Virginians have to submit to all these things, and a
</p>
<p>thousand more, and that in silence, or be threatened
</p>
<p>with a drawn halter around their necks. This is submission to the one-maanpower, the submission of whole
</p>
<p>States to a few contemptible, petty, tyrannical traitors.
</p>
<p>Yes, these secessionists won't submit to the regular,
</p>
<p>constituted authorities of their country, but they
</p>
<p>pompously and arrogantly dictate to others; and,
</p>
<p>unless all others bow in humble submission to them,
</p>
<p>they are to be hung, shot, quartered, tarred and
</p>
<p>feathered, and banished from their country. Good
</p>
<p>Lord deliver us!
</p>
<p>" Once more. When the militia were called out, this
</p>
<p>spring, it is well known that they were unwilling to go
</p>
<p>into service, and, the Confederate Government fearing
</p>
<p>the consequences, Congress passed an act of conscription,
</p>
<p>by which they were allforced into service, except a few,
</p>
<p>who so managed their cards as to elude the clutches
</p>
<p>of the military bands that were sent prowling through
</p>
<p>the country to catch them up and hurry them into the
</p>
<p>army. There was no submission in this, was there?
</p>
<p>Yes, submission of the most oppressive and aggravating
</p>
<p>character!-submission to a military despotism! submission, not to the Constitution of the United States,

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>"Is it not strange that men will croak and croak about
</p>
<p>submission, and the degradation of submission, while
</p>
<p>they themselves are trying'to browbeat and force all
</p>
<p>others to submit to their own lordly dictations, and
</p>
<p>while at the same time they are themselves submitting
</p>
<p>to the disobedience and insubordination of their own

<p>negroes? We say that Virginians have submitted long
</p>
<p>enough to the oppression and tyranny of petty despots,
</p>
<p>and it is now time for men who wish to be free to rise
</p>
<p>up and assert and maintain their rights.
</p>
<p>" If the citizens of Virginia were unanimously in favor
</p>
<p>of secession, why do they go into the army with so
</p>
<p>much reluctance? If every Southern man is to be left
</p>
<p>dead on the battle-field unless the. South obtain her independence, why is it that so many Southern men had
</p>
<p>to be forced into service by an act of conscription?
</p>
<p>And why is it that so many desert from the army?
</p>
<p>And why is it that men will lie in the woods day and

<p>these military man-hunters and murderers? These. are

<p>questions and facts which should be duly considered by

</p>
<p>the navigation of her rivers obstructed, her vessels all

<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of May
</p>
<p>27, 1862, we published the following editorial:"THREE UNION PRISONERS HUNG IN RICHMOND.
</p>
<p>" We clip the following paragraph from an exchange:Two weeks ago Jeff Davis had seven hundred and fifty
</p>
<p>loyal citizens of Virginia in his Castle Godwin and Carey
</p>
<p>Street prisons, in Richmond. Every hour was adding
</p>
<p>to the number, as it was but necessary for one to express a doubt of the immaculateness of the Confederate
</p>
<p>Government to be denounced, arrested, and sent down
</p>
<p>to Richmond. Three of these prisoners were recently
</p>
<p>taken out aiid hung without judge or jury.'
</p>
<p>" The above may all be true, or it may not. There
</p>
<p>may be seven hundred and fifty loyal citizens of Virginia in prison in Richmond, or there may not. Three
</p>
<p>may have been hung without judge or jury, or they
</p>
<p>may not. Be all this as it may, we are convinced that
</p>
<p>many of the so-called friends of the Southern Confederacy have done great injury to the success of the

<p>in society may admit them. That this has been the case
</p>
<p>is well known to many of the citizens in this town and

<p>in the surrounding country. And men, too, are engaged in this low, dirty, slanderous work, who boast
</p>
<p>of being the noble ones whose' ancient though ignoble blood
</p>
<p>Has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood.'
</p>
<p>Yes, these men have acted well their part in this infamous game of persecuting, proscribing, and ostracizing
</p>
<p>good and loyal citizens of Virginia.
</p>
<p>"For example: who were the accusers of Major
</p>
<p>Charles Williams? Who were the judges by whom he
</p>
<p>was condemned? What was the crime of which he
</p>
<p>was accused? What was the magnitude of his guilt?
</p>
<p>iWhy do not his accusers come out openly and let the

<p>world know all about it? It is high -treason for one to

<p>condemn secession: it is a crime for which he must be

<p>adjudged to imprisonment for months, &id, may-be,

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>345
</p>
<p>fore this war commenced, we predicted that Virginia
</p>
<p>would be the great battle-field of this wicked revolution, and repeatedly said that, if the Gulf States had
</p>
<p>been geographically located as Virginia was, they
</p>
<p>would never have seceded. The people of the Gulf
</p>
<p>States knew that Virginia and all the border States
</p>
<p>would be a bastion, a mighty bulwark of defence, between themselves and the enemy. They had never
</p>
<p>supposed that the war would be carried into their own
</p>
<p>territories. No: this was not their calculation.
</p>
<p>"When the Southern soldiers came into Virginia
</p>
<p>and to Fredericksburg last spring, twelve months ago,
</p>
<p>they said that they had come to defend the soil of
</p>
<p>Virginia. This we regarded as an insult to the intelligence of Virginians,-a solemn mockery. They
</p>
<p>came to meet the enemy on Virginia soil, to keep him
</p>
<p>off their own soil and out of their own territories.
</p>
<p>This we knew, and the leaders of this revolution in the
</p>
<p>cotton and sugar States knew the same thing; and
</p>
<p>yet it was considered treasonable for any one openly
</p>
<p>to express such an opinion. Let any one now take a
</p>
<p>calm survey of the territorial boundaries of Virginia,
</p>
<p>and then say that our predictions were not correct to
</p>
<p>the very letter!

<p>"At least two-thirds of her beautiful territory are
</p>
<p>in the actual possession of the Federal Government,
</p>
<p>while the small portion of Eastern Virginia which is
</p>
<p>not yet invaded, and in the centre of which stand the
</p>
<p>capital of the State and the capital of the Confederate
</p>
<p>States, is completely environed, pent up between two

<p>"In fact, if the war should continue in Virginia twelve

<p>relate the history of her woes, after the war shall have

<p>" Is it possible that Virginians are so utterly blinded
</p>
<p>and prejudiced as to be willing to sacrifice their childreni, their whole State, and every thing that is near
</p>
<p>and dear to a true patriot, for no holier purpose than
</p>
<p>to try to establish a negro-oligarchy in the Gulf States?
</p>
<p>And are the poorer classes of the people so profoundly

<p>the Southern Confederacy. Generals Lee, Floyd, Wise,
</p>
<p>and others were sent to coerce them into submission to
</p>
<p>the Confederate Government; with what success, however, is well known to the American people.
</p>
<p>"If South Carolina, or seven States, had the legitimate right to secede from the Federal Government,
</p>
<p>contrary to the wishes and interests of all the other

<p>not the counties in Western Virginia the legitimate

<p>right to secede from the remaining portion of the

</p>
<p>composed of all the States and Territories in the Union,

<p>"AccoRDING to all accounts received of the great

</p>
<p>terrible on both sides. The most fertile imagination

<p>can never fully picture the horrors of that scene.
</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of the dead, dying, and

<p>wounded lay commingled upon the battle-field. All

<p>ranks and conditions, from generals down to the humblest private, the rich and poor, the high and low, the
</p>
<p>learned and unlearned, find a common level on'the
</p>
<p>battle-ground. But the sad story of sorrow and suffering ends not there. A nation's eye is turned to that
</p>
<p>fatal spot, and a nation's heart is made to bleed. Wives
</p>
<p>are made widows, children are made orphans, and parents are deprived of the hope and stay of life in their

<p>declining years. Truly has the territory of Virginia

<p>become a common battle-field, and her sacred soil a

<p>common burying-ground. All, all to gratify the unholy ambition of ungodly, disappointed demagogues!"

<p>"'GETTING OUR RIGHTS.
</p>
<p>"MANY of the humble poor who never owned a
</p>
<p>negro in all their lives, and perhaps never would, if they
</p>
<p>were to live to be one hundred years old, were the
</p>
<p>loudest in huzzaing at the downfall of their country,
</p>
<p>and the most vociferous in clamoring for'our rights,'
</p>
<p>while the great struggle between the Unionists and
</p>
<p>secessionists was raging in Fredericksburg and in Virginia eighteen months ago.. We were forcibly reminded
</p>
<p>of this the other day, when, walking down street, we
</p>
<p>happened to fall in with a man who remarked,'Times
</p>
<p>are awful hard: poor people can't get any work to do.
</p>
<p>They can't get any thing to live on. What do you
</p>
<p>think of it?' We simply remarked,'We are getting
</p>
<p>our rights,' and passed on.'We want our rights;
</p>
<p>we must have our rights; we will fight for our rights!'
</p>
<p>was the cry at every corner of the streets,-when no one
</p>
<p>had troubled their rights in any respect whatever, and
</p>
<p>they were protected by the Government in every right
</p>
<p>they could claim or ever had.
</p>

<p>thousand imaginary rights which were perilled,-that
</p>
<p>secession was the only security for holding on to their
</p>
<p>rights,-that secession would multiply their rights a

</p>
<p>GOD WILL PROSPER THE RIGHT.
</p>
<p>"BEFORE the inauguration of the present war, and
</p>
<p>long after it had commenced, we were repeatedly told
</p>
<p>that, if the Southern Confederacy were right, she
</p>
<p>would certainly succeed; but if she were wrong, the
</p>
<p>Federal party would triumph: that God would prosper
</p>
<p>the party that was in the right. If, therefore, the
</p>
<p>Federal Government should succeed, are these same
</p>
<p>persons willing to return to the Union and prove loyal
</p>
<p>to the Federal Government? If they are not and do
</p>
<p>not, then they will ignore the confidence which they
</p>
<p>professed to have in God, and will, to all intents and
</p>
<p>purposes, prove themselves to be infidels, as well as
</p>
<p>traitors to the South and to their country. To whom,
</p>
<p>then, can they look for mercy or help? European
</p>
<p>powers will not, in our humble opinion, recognize
</p>
<p>them;'King Cotton' has proved impotent to save them;
</p>
<p>and if they continue to spurn the Federal Government, where can they go, and what will they do?

</p>
<p>their rebellion, return to the Union, and become loyal
</p>
<p>to the Federal Government? Agricultural operations
</p>
<p>to a great extent, are neglected, and in many sections
</p>
<p>of Virginia where, a year past, thousands of bushels of
</p>
<p>wheat and corn, &c. &c., were raised, nothing at all is
</p>
<p>now being produced. Negroes are leaving from almost
</p>
<p>every part of the State,-which seriously diminishes
</p>
<p>the amount of labor hitherto bestowed on agriculture.
</p>
<p>Thousands on thousands of the laboring-class of the
</p>
<p>white male population of the State have been forced
</p>
<p>into the army, and their small farms are, consequently,
</p>
<p>neglected; and even in sections where there are no
</p>
<p>armies the state of excitement is such, and the scarcity
</p>
<p>of labor is so great, that comparatively little produce
</p>
<p>can, possibly, be raised in the State; while very
</p>
<p>nearly the whole army of the Southern Confederacy is
</p>
<p>encamped within the territory of Virginia, and must
</p>
<p>be supported.
</p>
<p>"The money currency of the Southern Confederacy
</p>
<p>is comparatively valueless outside of the lines of the
</p>
<p>Confederate army. Suppose that soldiers in the Southern army who have families within the lines of the
</p>
<p>Federal army could send the money they receive to
</p>
<p>their families: it would answer no valuable purpose
</p>
<p>whatever, because they cannot purchase such articles
</p>
<p>with it as they need. It is well known that Southern
</p>
<p>soldiers are paid off in Southern money, and that,
</p>
<p>too, for the most part, in Confederate notes. Therefore, these notes, even if suffering families and destitute persons could obtain them, would profit them
</p>
<p>little outside of the Southern Confederacy. It requires
</p>
<p>no argument to prove the correctness of this remark:

<p>facts prove it to be true beyond contradiction.

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>365
</p>
<p>"In Fredericksburg, for example, there are thousands
</p>
<p>upon thousands of dollars' worth of Confederate notes;
</p>
<p>and yet the holders of these notes cannot use them for
</p>
<p>any valuable purpose, because Federal merchants in
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg refuse to take them, for the simple
</p>
<p>reason that they can make no valuable disposition of
</p>
<p>them at the North. The question then naturally
</p>
<p>arises, what is to become of families who are destitute
</p>
<p>of the necessaries of life, having no means to obtain
</p>
<p>them, and whose husbands and sons, being in the army,
</p>
<p>are not able to provide for them?
</p>
<p>"Under ordinary circumstances, this would be a
</p>
<p>rather unpleasant picture to contemplate; but, under
</p>
<p>present circumstances, the aspect of affairs is absolutely
</p>
<p>alarming. Just let any one reflect for a single moment,
</p>
<p>and common sense must teach him that the poor families of soldiers who are in the Confederate army are
</p>
<p>in a most terribly awful condition. Very nearly the
</p>
<p>whole country which has been forsaken by the Confederate army is left bare and desolate. Stock, and
</p>
<p>all kinds of provisions, to a very considerable extent,
</p>
<p>were taken for the support of the army. In many
</p>
<p>sections of the country, fencing has been totally destroyed, horses, oxen, and wagons have been pressed
</p>
<p>into service, and thousands of women and children
</p>
<p>have been left destitute, with no one to attend to
</p>
<p>farming-operations. What is to become of these
</p>
<p>families of forsaken, destitute women and children?
</p>
<p>Under the most favorable circumstances in which we
</p>
<p>can possibly view this subject, these families must
</p>
<p>suffer. It cannot be otherwise. And even if they had

<p>the means with which to purchase, the goods are not in

</p>
<p>speak in tones of thunder, warning men everywhere to
</p>
<p>return to their God, their country, and their duty
</p>
<p>before famine and death prove their ruin.
</p>
<p>"True, this is a fearful picture to men of wealth, as
</p>
<p>well as to the poorer classes. Say they,'We have
</p>
<p>sold our goods and our produce, and most of our money
</p>
<p>consists of Confederate notes, and our negroes are
</p>
<p>leaving us, and we cannot use our money, and we are
</p>
<p>making nothing and doing nothing; and, unless the
</p>
<p>South succeeds and gains her independence, we shall
</p>
<p>lose all we have, and will be reduced to a state of comparative poverty,-to which we cannot submit. The
</p>
<p>South will-the South must-conquer.'
</p>
<p>"The fact is, the South can never conquer. It is
</p>
<p>trifling with the feelings of an injured and outraged
</p>
<p>people to talk about'the darkest hour being just
</p>
<p>before day.' There never has, in our humble opinion,
</p>
<p>been but one dark hour to the South; and that hour
</p>
<p>began when the'flag' of our country was insulted at
</p>
<p>Charleston, South Carolina, on the 12th day of April,
</p>
<p>1861; and that dark hour will never end until the
</p>
<p>South lays down her arms and returns again into the
</p>
<p>Union. The longer she holds out, the darker and
</p>
<p>darker the hour will become, until it shall condense
</p>
<p>into Egyptian darkness, that can and will be felt.

<p>"What chance is there for the bursting out of light
</p>
<p>on the Southern Confederacy? Let us see.

</p>
<p>the men come from to reorganize another Southern
</p>
<p>army? The men are not in the South: therefore the South can never raise another considerable
</p>
<p>army. The most of the Southern army is now cooped
</p>
<p>up in and around Richmond, and evidently the greater
</p>
<p>part of the Confederate force is in Virginia. How
</p>
<p>can that army be sustained there during the summer,
</p>
<p>fall, and the next winter,-even supposing Richmond
</p>
<p>cannot be taken by the Federal forces? Where are
</p>
<p>all the supplies to come from to support two hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty thousand soldiers, and all the horses,-to say
</p>
<p>nothing about the citizens, and the thousands of negroes
</p>
<p>that have been sent from different parts of Virginia to
</p>
<p>Richmond for protection? Suppose they have corn
</p>
<p>and flour in abundance to last them for so long a period,
</p>
<p>(which we very much question:) where and how can
</p>
<p>they obtain meat, salt, and clothing for such a vast
</p>
<p>number of men? The soldiers, citizens, and negroes
</p>
<p>must all have something to eat and wear, or else they
</p>
<p>must starve. The horses and oxen must all be fed, or
</p>
<p>they will die. The blockade is complete, and resources
</p>
<p>for supplies are nearly all cut off. How then, we ask,
</p>
<p>can the great army in Richmond be sustained for ten
</p>
<p>or twelve months longer, unless supplies can be obtained elsewhere than from Virginia and from the
</p>
<p>South? It cannot be! The truth is, every hour the
</p>
<p>South continues in arms, the worse it will be for her;
</p>
<p>and time will prove it so.
</p>
<p>" Suppose that another terrific battle should be fought
</p>
<p>at Richmond, and that McClellan's whole army should
</p>
<p>be demolished: would the United States Government

<p>give up the contest and acknowledge the independence

</p>
<p>they not make speeches now, delineating the beauties,
</p>
<p>glories, and excellencies of secession? Where is the'immovable foundation,' on which'African slavery'
</p>
<p>is'based',? It is sliding away by degrees, and is becoming wonderfully small and weak.
</p>
<p>"The leaders of secession are the men who'ought to
</p>
<p>feel ashamed to hold up their heads as they walk the
</p>
<p>streets of Fredericksburg,' beholding their disloyal
</p>
<p>servants running at will. They are the men who feel
</p>
<p>and know, and their consciences force them to mentally
</p>
<p>exclaim,'This is the work of our own hands; these are
</p>
<p>the blasted, withered fruits of our own unparalleled
</p>
<p>folly. We sowed the wind, and are reaping the whirlwind. We are the true enemies of ourselves, the
</p>
<p>enemies of our fellow-citizens, of the South, of our
</p>
<p>country, and the enemies of our God.'

</p>
<p>secessionists feel it, and know it, and are drinking the

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII.,"RING-LEADERS OF SECESSION.
</p>
<p>"THE ringleaders in this secession rebellion will, when
</p>
<p>the tragical scenes shall have closed, become a proverb,
</p>
<p>a byword, and a hissing among all the nations of the
</p>
<p>civilized world. They shall be scattered to the four
</p>
<p>corners of the earth, and, like the old, hard-hearted
</p>
<p>Jews, shall be politically sold to their enemies for bondmen, and no man shall buy them.' Then it will be seen and acknowledged that the whole
</p>
<p>plot was conceived in iniquity, was conducted by a systematic course of villany, and ended in irretrievable
</p>
<p>infamy. This is what we predicted when the rebellion
</p>
<p>began, and it is what we have believed ever since. And
</p>
<p>as certainly as every cause produces its legitimate effect,
</p>
<p>so it will come to pass. Union men have nothing to
</p>
<p>fear in the distant future. History and posterity will
</p>
<p>do them and their cause justice. Then it will also be
</p>
<p>seen that the Union men of the South were the only true

<p>1862, we published the following editorials:
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>371
</p>
<p>"SUBJECTS FOR REFLECTION.
</p>
<p>"Superstition and credulity have acted well their
</p>
<p>part in working out the ruin of Virginia and the whole
</p>
<p>South. Many of the clergymen of the South, long before the inauguration of the present war, were actively
</p>
<p>engaged in sowing the seeds of discord and contention
</p>
<p>and in firing up the Southern heart to deeds of daring
</p>
<p>rebellion against the Federal Government. That they
</p>
<p>handled this subject cautiously and ingeniously, yet,
</p>
<p>but too effectually, facts prove beyond contradiction.
</p>
<p>" Certain preachers itinerated all through the State of
</p>
<p>Virginia, delineating the'glories of Southern Methodism,' and hurling unmitigated anathemas against the'Northern Methodists' particularly, and the'Northern people' generally. They took'the field,' politicians-like, and went from county to county, from village
</p>
<p>to village, from town to town, from city to city, and
</p>
<p>from one community to another, discussing the merits
</p>
<p>of African slavery, and begging money to endow their
</p>
<p>sectarian, Southern-Methodistic, pro-slavery colleges.
</p>
<p>Slavery! Slavery! Slavery! and Money! Money! Money i! were the all-absorbing topics. Persons who happened not to be of their peculiar cast of mind, and who
</p>
<p>refused to chime in with them, were placed under the
</p>
<p>ban of public censure, so far as their influence extended. To listen to the pompous utterances of these
</p>
<p>little divinity, self-conceited, clerical coxcombs, one
</p>
<p>would infer that they firmly believed themselves to be
</p>
<p>the divinely-appointed guardians of the South and of
</p>
<p>the whole Southern people, and that no one was interested in the whole matter but themselves. They

</p>
<p>cause of the peculiar denominational title which they
</p>
<p>assumed to take to themselves:'The Southern Methodist Church;''The Methodist Episcopal Church, South.'
</p>
<p>They seemed to think that the name'Southern Methodist' was sufficient to place one above suspicion of
</p>
<p>being an Abolitionist, or of having any Northern proclivities whatever.
</p>
<p>"Their strong argument was, God was with them:
</p>
<p>God had blessed their labors; God had added thousands
</p>
<p>and thousands to their numbers; and their very fanaticism and extravagance were passed off as emanations
</p>
<p>of the eternal divinity, or direct influences of the'Holy
</p>
<p>Ghost.'
</p>
<p>" The hearts and minds of the Southern people being
</p>
<p>fired up by these divines, and by politicians acting in
</p>
<p>concert with them, it was an easy matter for them,
</p>
<p>when the war began, to attribute every seeming success to the direct interposition of Almighty God, and
</p>
<p>to induce the people to believe it. Hence, when the
</p>
<p>attack was made on Fort Sumter, and after the battle
</p>
<p>had been fought and no one was killed, the cry was,'God is with us;'' God is fighting our battles for us;''God directs the bullets.' After the fight at Acquia
</p>
<p>Creek, last spring was twelve months ago, and'nobody got killed,' the cry was,'God is fighting our
</p>
<p>battles.'
</p>
<p>" When portions of the Federal fleet stranded last year
</p>
<p>on the Carolina coasts,'God had raised the winds and
</p>
<p>sent the storms for the express purpose of destroying
</p>
<p>the Yankee vessels.' After the Federal troops had
</p>
<p>rebuilt the railroad-bridge across the Rappahannock
</p>
<p>River at Fredericksburg, and the freshet came and

<p>washed it away,'God sent the freshet to destroy
</p>
<p>THtE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>373
</p>
<p>the bridge.''Such doings can't prosper.''God will
</p>
<p>put a stop to it.' Again the bridge was rebuilt, and
</p>
<p>had been used only a day or two, when there came
</p>
<p>another freshet, at an unusual season of the year, and
</p>
<p>swept it away again.'Surely this is the work of God.''Don't you see?'' Didn't we tell you so?''It can't
</p>
<p>prosper.''God is above the devil, thank the Lord.'
</p>
<p>" Now, let us examine this subject a little. If God
</p>
<p>was specially with either party in the beginning of this
</p>
<p>unholy war, and favored that party because it was in
</p>
<p>the right, why has he at any time suffered reverses to
</p>
<p>befall that party? Has he not the wisdom to see, and
</p>
<p>the power to accomplish all his purposes? Surely he
</p>
<p>has! Why then is he constantly changing his purposes,-to-day with the Confederates, helping them,
</p>
<p>and to-morrow with the Federals, lending them a helping hand! Really, we think it high time for the people
</p>
<p>to put a stop to all this nonsense about God being with
</p>
<p>this, that, or the other party, fighting their battles for
</p>
<p>them, &c. &c. We consider it nothing more nor less
</p>
<p>than horrid blasphemy to make God Almighty a party
</p>
<p>to the wickedness of mortals.
</p>
<p>"' If God raises the winds and sends the storms to wreck
</p>
<p>the Federal vessels, why does he not make a clean
</p>
<p>sweep of it, and sink them all at once, and have done
</p>
<p>with it? If he sends the rains: to raise the rivers to
</p>
<p>wash away their bridges, why does he not send the
</p>
<p>lightning and storm and kill them all in a body, and
</p>
<p>sweep them from the face of thu earth in an instant?
</p>
<p>Does he lack the power? If not, why this piecemeal work? If Heaven be actually and specially engaged in fighting for the Southern Confederacy, why
</p>
<p>is all this running away of the darkies? Could not

</p>
<p>Providence put it into the minds and hearts of them all
</p>
<p>to remain at home and continue to work for their
</p>
<p>owners?
</p>
<p>" The truth is, designing men have imposed upon the
</p>
<p>credulity of the ignorant and unsuspecting so long that
</p>
<p>they think they can gag and cram any and every absurdity down their throats, however ridiculous, and the
</p>
<p>common people, the masses, are bound to receive and
</p>
<p>swallow it all, as coming directly from the high and
</p>
<p>holy fountain of divine inspiration. There is a fearful
</p>
<p>responsibility resting on preachers, editors, politicians,
</p>
<p>and others in this fearful tragedy, the due weight of
</p>
<p>which has never been felt by them. But a day of terrible reckoning is at hand, when men shall call upon
</p>
<p>the rocks and mountains to fall upon them and hide
</p>
<p>them from impending wrath; but it will then be too late.
</p>
<p>"That good may ultimately come out of this war, and
</p>
<p>order spring out of confusion, we do not question. The
</p>
<p>political, ecclesiastical, and moral world have all become so abominably corrupt that war may be absolutely necessary to purify the elements. Men must be
</p>
<p>humbled for their sins and rebellion against Heaven.
</p>
<p>God permits men and nations to quarrel and fight, and
</p>
<p>to take one another's lives, and to destroy each other;
</p>
<p>but this is not the will of God. God is a God of love,
</p>
<p>peace, and order, and not a God of wrath, of confusion,
</p>
<p>of battles, blood, and carnage.
</p>
<p>"If an individual violate any one of the fixed laws of
</p>
<p>nature, he must and will suffer the penalty annexed to
</p>
<p>that law. If nations violate the laws of nature, humanity, and justice, they too must suffer for their crimes.

<p>"Let men, then, cease to prate about Divine Providence, about God's being with this, that, or the other
</p>
<p>party. The fact is, God is with and for but one party,
</p>
<p>and that is the good and right party, and that which
</p>
<p>is pure and holy and right and just God will bless
</p>
<p>and prosper, and nothing more; and for men whose
</p>
<p>minds and hearts are filled with vindictiveness, and
</p>
<p>every discordant and devilish passion, to prate about
</p>
<p>divine interposition, is folly, is wicked, is blasphemy.
</p>
<p>"The elements in the political, religious, social, and

<p>moral world are all in commotion, and the whole order
</p>
<p>of things is undergoing a complete revolution; old
</p>
<p>things are passing away, and all things are becoming
</p>
<p>new; a great struggle is going on between the spirit
</p>
<p>of despotism on the one hand, and freedom on the other,
</p>
<p>between mind and institutionalism; the great question
</p>
<p>is, shall despotism and institutionalism triumph over
</p>
<p>freedom and mind, or shall freedom and mind conquer

<p>despotism and institutionalism? This is the great,

</p>
<p>377
</p>
<p>sickness, and decently buried when dead, if owned by
</p>
<p>good, humane masters.
</p>
<p>"The rich, being independent of the labor of the
</p>
<p>poor white population, except so far as overseers and
</p>
<p>housekeepers are concerned, would have no respect
</p>
<p>nor sympathy for the poor laboring white class of the
</p>
<p>people whatever. It requires no argument to prove
</p>
<p>this fact. It is a lesson which the laboring poor have
</p>
<p>learned long ago, in all slave-holding communities.
</p>
<p>And even the labor of poor white mechanics is already
</p>
<p>reduced to an insignificant figure in the South. Already
</p>
<p>there are in the South thousands upon thousands of
</p>
<p>negro carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths, brickmasons, plasterers, &c. &c. All this labor comes into
</p>
<p>direct competition with the labor of poor white mechanics. They know it, they feel it, they quarrel
</p>
<p>about it; and still they wish and are trying to establish it permanently, thus fastening the curse upon
</p>
<p>themselves, and entailing it on their children through
</p>
<p>all time to come, by fighting to establish a negrooligarchy!
</p>
<p>"Colored labor costs the slave-owners nothing more
</p>
<p>than the board and tax of the laborers (after the laborers are once paid for); and the board is of the cheapest
</p>
<p>kind, and the tax but a small trifle. Hence slaveowners can have work executed much cheaper than
</p>
<p>white men can possibly do it. Therefore, when slave
</p>
<p>labor comes into competition with the labor of poor
</p>
<p>white men, how can the poor white laboring-classes
</p>
<p>support their families, pay all contingent expenses, and
</p>
<p>educate their children so as to give them a position in
</p>
<p>society and a rank with rich slave-holders' children?
</p>
<p>They cannot do it; it is impossible.

<p>" Nor is this all. It is a fact well known that wealthy
</p>
<p>citizens in the South, instead of patronizing their own
</p>
<p>mechanics, as a general rule, send to the North to purchase articles which would be manufactured at home
</p>
<p>if the manufacturers were encouraged. As long as
</p>
<p>this state of things continues, the poor will remain
</p>
<p>poor, and their children must of necessity be brought
</p>
<p>up in comparative ignorance, which, according to the
</p>
<p>opinion of some men, is just as it ought to be; because,
</p>
<p>say they,'poor people's children have no need of education.' Why have they no need of education? Because, if the masses were educated, they would no
</p>
<p>longer become the vassals of political tricksters, aspiring
</p>
<p>demagogues, and ecclesiastical knaves. Our country
</p>
<p>would be safe in the hands of an intelligent and virtuous people; and this, aspirants know and dread, and
</p>
<p>hence their aversion and deep-rooted prejudice to

<p>popular education.
</p>
<p>"We have always been pro-slavery in our feelings,more, however, on account of the negroes themselves

<p>than of any permanent, solid good they are to their

<p>owners. Our opinion has ever been that to change
</p>
<p>the relation which servants hold to their masters would
</p>
<p>be a great evil to the former; because, semi-civilized and semi-christianized as most of them are, and
</p>
<p>being uneducated, they are incapable of self-government. It seems to us, however, that the time has

<p>actually come when important changes are to be made

<p>and new relations are to be formed. And, while we

<p>thrown into one end of the balance, and negroes into

<p>379
</p>
<p>the other end, and the issue is being forced upon us,
</p>
<p>and the question is being asked us, which we will take,
</p>
<p>our country, or negroes, or our country without slavery,
</p>
<p>or slavery without our country, we answer, emphatically
</p>
<p>and uncompromisingly, OUR COUNTRY FOREVER!
</p>
<p>"We say that changes are being made and new
</p>
<p>relations are being formed. Servants are everywhere
</p>
<p>leaving their masters and flocking within the lines of
</p>
<p>the Federal troops. That they do this thing willingly,
</p>
<p>cannot be denied. It is an act of their own free volition. True, it is said that the'Yankees are stealing
</p>
<p>our negroes.' For the sake of argument, let us suppose that the'Yankees' have stolen all the negroes
</p>
<p>who have left their owners in the town of Fredericksbur.g. The negroes are constantly flocking into Fredericksburg from the *extreme borders of Essex,
</p>
<p>Hanover, King and Queen, Louisa, Caroline, Culpepper,
</p>
<p>Orange, Madison, Albemarle, and all the counties in
</p>
<p>the northern neck of Virginia, and from all parts of
</p>
<p>Spottsylvania county. Did the'Yankees' go to all
</p>
<p>these different localities and'steal away the negroes'?
</p>
<p>No: the negroes voluntarily leave their homes and come
</p>
<p>to Fredericksburg. What does all this argue? The
</p>
<p>problem is practically and literally demonstrated that
</p>
<p>the slaves of Virginia have an idea of freedom and a
</p>
<p>wish to obtain it, and are determined to be free. This
</p>
<p>is the only rational conclusion at which any sensible,
</p>
<p>logical mind can arrive. That they are determined to
</p>
<p>be free, and will certainly be free, is only a question of
</p>
<p>time. If, therefore, it is their wish and -determination
</p>
<p>to be free, it is by their own voluntary act; and if evil
</p>
<p>shall come to them: by this act, let it fall upon their

</p>
<p>generation will ever be bettered, we do not believe;
</p>
<p>while, on the other hand, we do not think that the condition of some of them can be very much worsted.
</p>
<p>Where they are going, and what ultimate destiny or
</p>
<p>locality awaits them in the future, we cannot tell.
</p>
<p>This is a grave question, and one which will demand
</p>
<p>the profoundest legislation of the nation. That provisions, however, will be made for them by the Government, we do not entertain a doubt.
</p>
<p>"Look at the deplorable condition to which our
</p>
<p>country, our children, our neighbors, and fellow-citizens, are all reduced on account of the negro, and then
</p>
<p>let any true-hearted patriot, humane father or mother,
</p>
<p>who have the natural sympathies and affections of
</p>
<p>parents or patriots, say what estimate they can ever
</p>
<p>hereafter place upon the institution of African slavery.
</p>
<p>" The question of African slavery has been made a
</p>
<p>pretext for secession; has broken up our Government,
</p>
<p>has inaugurated civil war, has desolated our country,
</p>
<p>has drenched our land in blood, has bleached the lofty
</p>
<p>hills and beautiful plains of our country with the bones
</p>
<p>of our children, brothers, fathers, friends, and neighbors, has made heart-broken widows of thousands, and
</p>
<p>penniless, starving orphans of millions, has robed a
</p>
<p>whole nation in the drapery of sorrow, lamentation,
</p>
<p>and woe; and the horrible work of destruction and

<p>killed; let our whole country sink to eternal ruin; but,
</p>
<p>for God's sake, let us keep our negroes!' This is the
</p>
<p>idea! Yes, Heaven knows that the negro is the one
</p>
<p>great, grand, and sublime idea with many of those
</p>
<p>who are constantly making terrible threats against
</p>
<p>good and loyal citizens and genuine patriots.

<p>"If these negro-idolizing gentlemen were forced to
</p>

</p>
<p>hard bread and spoiled meat, lie on the wet, cold
</p>
<p>ground, be drenched in torrents of rain, go half clothed
</p>
<p>and half starved as thousands of the poor soldiers are,
</p>
<p>and then had to face the mouths of cannons, and charge
</p>
<p>bayonets, they would find it a very different work from
</p>
<p>standing about the corners of the streets in the cool
</p>
<p>shade, concocting plans by which to hang Union men
</p>
<p>and have them punished after the Federal troops'are

<p>driven away.'
</p>
<p>"We say, and thousands of others would say the
</p>
<p>same thing if they were allowed to speak, and could
</p>
<p>be heard, both in and out of the Southern army,'Give
</p>
<p>us our country, our liberty, our freedom in the Union,

<p>has the heart of a demon, and what wife is there, but

<p>would gladly give up their negroes to receive back to

</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>"South Carolina inaugurated the war, and the
</p>
<p>United States Government has been and is still endeavoring to put down the ungodly rebellion and to
</p>
<p>restore peace and order once more in the country.
</p>
<p>And, under all the provoking circumstances, the lenity
</p>
<p>of the Federal Government towards the Southern
</p>
<p>people is absolutely without a parallel in the history
</p>
<p>of all wars, and of the whole wide world. The very
</p>
<p>mildness of the Government only provokes secessionists to greater insolence and contempt for the
</p>
<p>Union and the Government. We have been told that
</p>
<p>secessionists make their boasts that the Federal officers
</p>
<p>think more of them than they do of Union men. In
</p>
<p>fact, we have heard this remark ourself; and it has
</p>
<p>been told to us, as goading us for our Union sentiments,'Oh, yes: the Yankees don't think half as much
</p>
<p>of you Union men as they do of secessionists.' As
</p>
<p>if we professed to be Union men because of what'the
</p>
<p>Yankees' might think of us! Secessionists seem to
</p>
<p>presume upon their dignity to awe the Federal army
</p>
<p>into submission to their own will and pleasure. That
</p>
<p>leading secessionists in our community are daily becoming more and more bitter and vindictive towards
</p>
<p>Union men, and more and more hostile to the Federal
</p>
<p>Government, is questioned by no impartial observer.
</p>
<p>"We deeply deplore the present ungodly state of
</p>
<p>affairs, and do most devoutly wish and earnestly pray
</p>
<p>that men would reason on the subject as they should

<p>do, because this dignified stubbornness and haughty

<p>rebellion can never be productive of any good. Let

<p>1862, we published the following editorial:
</p>
<p>384
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>"SLANDERS REFUTED.-LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.
</p>
<p>"We understand that certain characters in town are
</p>
<p>reporting to the Federal officers and soldiers that we
</p>
<p>were a rank, rampant secessionist before the Federal
</p>
<p>troops came to Fredericksburg, but as soon as they
</p>
<p>came we turned right over to the other side.
</p>
<p>"This is an infamous lie, number one! Let any
</p>
<p>man come to us and tell us so.
</p>
<p>" Secondly, that we took the oath of allegiance to the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy.
</p>
<p>"This is a double-and-twisted; infamous lie, number
</p>
<p>two.
</p>
<p>"Thirdly, that we are a real genuine Yankee, from
</p>
<p>the State of Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>"This is a diabolical lie, number three.
</p>
<p>" If we were a rank, rampant secessionist before the
</p>
<p>Federal troops came to Fredericksburg, why did certain slanderous, infamous characters try to have us
</p>
<p>arrested last fall and winter because we were accused
</p>
<p>of holding secret Union meetings? We then indignantly hurled back the infamous slander into the face
</p>
<p>of the nefarious liars, and denounced the whole as being
</p>
<p>secession falsehoods. We have never held a Union
</p>
<p>meeting in the town of Fredericksburg, nor anywhere
</p>
<p>else, since the ever-memorable night we held a public
</p>
<p>Union meeting in the court-house in the town of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg, when a set of unprincipled secession
</p>
<p>scoundrels tried to break it up, and, while we were
</p>
<p>addressing our fellow-citizens and warning them of
</p>
<p>the evils which they are now suffering, some finished
</p>
<p>scoundrel threw an egg at us, which, failing to reach

<p>us, hit a young man on the head who was seated in our
</p>
<p>tE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>385
</p>
<p>front. Because we denied the libellous charge of holding'secret Union meetings,' and avowed our devotion
</p>
<p>to the South, as we have always done and still glory in
</p>
<p>doing, therefore we were'a rank, rampant secessionist
</p>
<p>before the Yankees came to town.' We humbly trust
</p>
<p>in God that the time is not far distant when we can
</p>
<p>once more hold public Union meetings in the town of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg, and then we will make a revelation of
</p>
<p>facts which will astonish secessionists themselves.
</p>
<p>" If we were'a rank, rampant secessionist' before'the Yankees' came to Fredericksburg, why was it reported throughout the State of Virginia last winter
</p>
<p>that we were arrested and sent to Richmond for treason
</p>
<p>against old Jeff Davis and the Southern [Conspiracy]
</p>
<p>Confederacy?
</p>
<p>" If we were'a rank, rampant secessionist' before'the Yankees came to Fredericksburg,' why did some
</p>
<p>one in Cary's regiment, the day they passed our door
</p>
<p>on Main Street as they were on their way to North
</p>
<p>Carolina last winter, cry out,'God damn old Hunnicutt! Let's drive him and old Miller, and all the damned
</p>
<p>party of them, before us to -Richmond'? How can these
</p>
<p>same individuals, who used their utmost endeavors to
</p>
<p>have us arrested last winter and this spring because of
</p>
<p>our'Union proclivities,' now have the unblushing impudence to say that we were one of the most'hotheaded, rank, rampant secessionists in all the country'?
</p>
<p>"As to the report of our taking the oath of allegiance to Jeff Davis and the Southern Confederacy, the
</p>
<p>idea is so supremely ridiculous that it needs no comment. No human being upon the face of the broad
</p>
<p>earth ever asked us to take any such accursed oath.

<p>of her leaders, South Carolina would be in the Union

<p>a new leaf, and see what is on the other side of the

<p>page.

<p>not the publication of the'Democratic Recorder' continued after the arrival of the Federal army?
</p>
<p>"Why were the Fredericksburg'News' and the

<p>Virginia' Herald' discontinued?

<p>" Why do not secession flags float over the town of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg now?
</p>
<p>"Have all the secessionists left Fredericksburg?
</p>
<p>No, indeed. Why, then, do they not hoist their colors?
</p>
<p>"Why have all the ministers of the gospel in Fredericksburg ceased to offer up publicly in their congregations holy prayers for Jeff Davis, the'chief magistrate' of the'glorious Southern Confederacy'?
</p>
<p>",Have editors; ministers, and all the citizens turned
</p>
<p>Union-shriekers, submissionists, and Abolitionists since'the Yankees came to town'? Why, then, do they
</p>
<p>not go on and write and act and speak as they did last

<p>as they wish to do this year. It simply proves that we

<p>are all creatures of circumstances and must act accordingly."
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIV.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the " Christian Banner" of July 14,:
</p>
<p>1862, we published the following editorials:"LET REASON AND COMMON SENSE HAVE FAIR PLAY.
</p>
<p>"It is folly to reason and argue with men who are
</p>
<p>governed by prejudice and passion. This class of persons cannot be profited by any arguments used to convince them, simply because they are determined not to
</p>
<p>be convinced. There is another class, however, who
</p>
<p>are not wholly abandoned to prejudice and passion and
</p>
<p>who are not entirely given over to judicial blindness;
</p>
<p>and to this latter class we wish to make a few remarks, earnestly hoping to be able to influence them
</p>
<p>in their future course of action. If by any possible
</p>
<p>argument we shall be able to induce them to return to
</p>
<p>their former allegiance to their country, our highest
</p>
<p>wish will be attained. To this class, then, we appeal.
</p>
<p>"Do not facts fully justify us in saying that secession is a political swindle, and that Virginians have
</p>
<p>been swindled out of every right which they held dear

<p>these political tricksters say that if Virginia seceded
</p>
<p>she would be the greatest State in the whole Southern
</p>
<p>Confederacy? that her wealth would increase abundantly, and in the'shortest conceivable time? that
</p>
<p>slave property would advance at least fifty per cent.?
</p>
<p>that millions of capital would flow into all the towns
</p>
<p>and cities of Virginia, and that they would soon become large and populous? that she would soon become a great manufacturing State, and would be to the
</p>
<p>other States of the Southern Confederacy what the
</p>
<p>North had always been to the whole South? that
</p>
<p>there would be'peaceable secession'? that there was
</p>
<p>no danger of war of any magnitude? that the

<p>Yankees' loved the immortal dollar too well to involve

<p>themselves in the expenses of war? that the North

<p>had not the means to prosecute a successful war against

<p>man could whip five' Yankees'? that'Yankees'
</p>
<p>neither knew how to fight, nor had the'spunk' to

<p>fight even if they knew how? that the Southern
</p>
<p>army would take Washington City,'rescue downtrodden Maryland,' and go on to Philadelphia and
</p>
<p>make it a war of invasion against the North, and not a
</p>
<p>defensive war? that if there should, by any possible
</p>
<p>contingency, be war at all, it would be one of short
</p>
<p>duration? that the interest and sympathy of England
</p>
<p>and France were with the South, and that those Governments would certainly acknowledge the independence of the Southern Confederacy? that cotton was

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>389
</p>
<p>that they were not to leave their own sections of the
</p>
<p>country, and certainly should not be sent out of their
</p>
<p>State? that negroes would prove loyal to their masters, and would be one of the most effective elements
</p>
<p>in prosecuting the war? that they would cultivate
</p>
<p>the farms, and raise an abundance of produce, while the
</p>
<p>white men would carry on the war?
</p>
<p>"And, since the war has been progressing, has not
</p>
<p>the promise always been that the'Yankees' shall be
</p>
<p>driven off every foot of Virginia territory? Has it not
</p>
<p>been said that every defeat and retreat of the Southern
</p>
<p>armies was only a strategic move to draw the enemy
</p>
<p>out of his strongholds? that Southern forts and cities
</p>
<p>were impregnable to the assaults of the enemy, and could
</p>
<p>never be taken? And, since they have been taken, has
</p>
<p>not the promise been made to the remaining citizens of
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy that they will all soon be
</p>
<p>retaken by the Confederate forces? And still the cry is,'The South will soon whip the North, and make the
</p>
<p>North submit to just such terms as the South may
</p>
<p>demand; and then Union men in the South will be dealt
</p>
<p>with as traitors, and all their effects will be confiscated.'
</p>
<p>"By such threats, Union men in the South are still

<p>held in awe, and fear to avow their honest sentiments,
</p>
<p>because of the threatened vials of wrath which are to
</p>
<p>be poured out, without any mixture of mercy, upon their

<p>devoted heads.

</p>
<p>further; but we pause to inquire if all these things
</p>
<p>have come to pass. And now, kind reader, we entreat

<p>you to lay all prejudice aside and look facts and realities full in the face, and then answer candidly if you

<p>"Since Virginia seceded, in what has she become

<p>great, except in that she has become the great battlefield of all the Southern States, and her territory a
</p>
<p>great common burial-ground? Truly may it be said
</p>
<p>that Virginia is the great valley of dead men's bones.
</p>
<p>In what has she increased in wealth in so short a
</p>
<p>period, but in thousands of armed soldiers, in the
</p>
<p>desolation of her farms, and sorrow, woe, and afflictions on all her inhabitants? Has slave property advanced fifty per cent. in value? Is the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery placed on a sure and immovable foundation?
</p>
<p>Have not slaves become valueless, and is not the institution virtually abolished? Have millions of wealth
</p>
<p>flowed into the towns and cities of Virginia, and have
</p>
<p>they become populous? Is there any probability that
</p>
<p>this will soon be the case? Are they not deserted in
</p>
<p>many instances by native citizens, and filled with
</p>
<p>legions of armed soldiers? Is there any reasonable
</p>
<p>prospect that Virginia will ever become a great manufacturing State by her own native-born citizens, and
</p>
<p>that she will be to the other Confederate States what
</p>
<p>the North has always been to the South? Instead
</p>
<p>of'peaceable secession,' has there not been war, and
</p>
<p>that, too, of the most fearful magnitude and of the most
</p>
<p>malignant character? Is not the war still raging most

<p>terribly, so that no one can tell when and where and
</p>
<p>how the awful scene will end? Have the'Yankees'

</p>
<p>391
</p>
<p>throughout tne war, thus far, that'one Southern man
</p>
<p>can whip five Yankees,'-that the Yankees do not
</p>
<p>know how to fight, and that they have no'pluck' to
</p>
<p>fight? Has the Southern army taken Washington
</p>
<p>City, rescued'poor down-trodden Maryland,' and
</p>
<p>marched into Philadelphia, making it a war of invasion
</p>
<p>on the North? Has the war been one of short duration,-only three, six, or nine months, or a year? Are
</p>
<p>the interests and sympathies of England and France
</p>
<p>with the South, and have these Governments acknowledged the independence of the Southern Confederacy?
</p>
<p>Has cotton proved to be universal king, ruling the

<p>European powers, and the North'into the bargain'?
</p>
<p>Have not many of the volunteers who first enlisted in
</p>
<p>Virginia been called away from their own sections of
</p>
<p>the country and sent out of the State? and when the
</p>
<p>twelve months for which they enlisted had expired,
</p>
<p>were they not all forced, by an act of the Confederate
</p>
<p>Congress, to remain in the army? Have negroes proved
</p>
<p>loyal to their masters, and are they likely to prove
</p>
<p>themselves to be one of the most effective elements in
</p>
<p>prosecuting the war? Are they cultivating the farms
</p>
<p>of their owners, and raising an abundance of produce
</p>
<p>to carry on the war? Have the'Yankees' been'driven off every foot of Virginia soil'? If every
</p>
<p>defeat and retreat is only a strategic move to draw
</p>
<p>the enemy out of his strongholds, why are the defeats
</p>
<p>so frequent and the retreats so far? Have Southern
</p>
<p>forts and cities proved to be impregnable to the assaults

<p>of the enemy? How many of the Southern forts,

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>"Look at all these facts, intelligent reader, and then
</p>
<p>tell us how long it will take the South, according to
</p>
<p>the progress which she has made for the last eighteen
</p>
<p>months, to whip out the North and make the Government of the United States submit to just such terms'as the South may demand.' With all these solemn
</p>
<p>facts and stern realities staring men full in the face,
</p>
<p>still there are those who persist in saying that'the
</p>
<p>Southern army will soon retake all the Southern towns,
</p>
<p>cities, forts, and localities which are now being occupied by the Federal troops.' True, some of them may
</p>
<p>be recaptured and held for a short time; but what will
</p>
<p>the retaking of them advantage the citizens? Will it
</p>
<p>not be attended with great loss of private property,
</p>
<p>and perhaps at the expense of the lives of many of
</p>
<p>the citizens themselves? What, then, can be gained by
</p>
<p>a continued, pertinacious rebellion against the Government of the United States? Nothing, absolutely nothing, is to be gained, but every thing to be lost.
</p>
<p>"Again: were we not told by secessionists that,'whenever' and'wherever' the'vandals' got possession
</p>
<p>of any of the Southern towns, cities, localities, &c. &c.,
</p>
<p>they insulted and outraged Southern ladies, offering to them every vulgar indignity of which debased
</p>
<p>and corrupt humanity is capable? that their mission
</p>
<p>was one of robbery, plunder, insult, and general carnage, and that they laid waste every thing before them
</p>
<p>in their onward move? Yes; secessionists said that
</p>
<p>the Union troops did all these things.
</p>
<p>"Have they done these things in Fredericksburg?
</p>
<p>Have they disturbed any citizen, male or female, in his
</p>
<p>or her daily, legal avocation? No, not one. What

</p>
<p>troops since their arrival in the city? Has not the' Flag of the Union' been constantly insulted and the
</p>
<p>Federal Government abused by citizens ever since the
</p>
<p>town has been occupied by the Federal troops? And,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding all this, has not the property of secessionists-and those, too, of the bitterest stamp-been
</p>
<p>guarded and protected by the Union soldiers? Has
</p>
<p>there ever within the memory of the oldest citizens
</p>
<p>been better order uniformly maintained in the town of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg than there has been since its occupation
</p>
<p>by the Union army? Was there ever such lenity in
</p>
<p>time of war extended to any people in the world's
</p>
<p>history as has been exhibited towards the people of
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg? Yet, astonishing to say, the very
</p>
<p>kindness of the Federal authorities seems but to increase the stubbornness and deepen the hatred of many
</p>
<p>of the citizens,
</p>
<p>"' But they steal our negroes; and that's just what
</p>
<p>they came down here to do.' Indeed! Did Government
</p>
<p>send out an army to station guards around men's
</p>
<p>houses, farms, and negro-quarters, to keep the servants
</p>
<p>from running away from their owners, and to catch
</p>
<p>them and carry them back to their masters? Is it
</p>
<p>not strange that a people who say that they despise
</p>
<p>the Union, detest the Federal Government, and declare
</p>
<p>that they have taken themselves from under its safe
</p>
<p>and kind protection, should complain because that
</p>
<p>Government does not keep their slaves from running
</p>
<p>away, and, after they do run away, complain because
</p>
<p>the soldiers do not run after them, catch them, and

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>faithfully warned of all these evils long before they
</p>
<p>came to pass? Secessionists have done it all; these
</p>
<p>are the direct evils of their own wicked doings: they
</p>
<p>have no right to complain; they did it.
</p>
<p>"Nor is this all. If the people continue in a state of
</p>
<p>vindictive rebellion against the Federal Government,
</p>
<p>they have not yet realized half the bitter fruits and
</p>
<p>terrible evils that are in store for them. Hence we do
</p>
<p>most earnestly entreat our fellow-citizens to lay aside
</p>
<p>their hostile feelings to the Government and take their
</p>
<p>stand with loyal citizens, and then they can confidently
</p>
<p>claim, and will certainly obtain, protection under the
</p>
<p>time-honored'Flag of the Union.'
</p>
<p>"To continue in a state of unconditional, uncompromising rebellion cannot possibly better the condition
</p>
<p>of any one. It will never make Confederate notes
</p>
<p>equal to specie. It will never bring back a single servant who has left his master, nor will it prevent others
</p>
<p>from running away. It will not diminish the number
</p>
<p>of our children, relatives, friends, and neighbors who
</p>
<p>are being slain in battle or are dying in distant hospitals. On the contrary, the longer this ungodly rebellion continues, the greater will be the number of
</p>
<p>slaves that will make their escape, and their value will
</p>
<p>constantly diminish. The less valuable Confederate
</p>
<p>notes become,-if they can sink below their present
</p>
<p>value,-the more and more of our sons and friends will
</p>
<p>fall either by the sword or by disease, the more and
</p>
<p>more will our country be desolated, and the more destitute the great masses of the people will become,
</p>
<p>until one common ruin will swallow up the whole.

<p>the Union troops, they have manifested but little sympathy, and still less respect, for the wives and daughters

<p>dragged from their homes, thus depriving helpless
</p>
<p>females and children of that protection which God
</p>
<p>and nature designed they should have. We cannot

<p>believe that many of the leaders in this unrighteous
</p>
<p>rebellion have any sympathy for the great mass of the'common people;' and yet the people seem bent and

<p>determined on believing in them, and following them

<p>to the very last extremity and consummation of ruin.'The South will whip the North,'-will drive every
</p>
<p>one of the'Yankees off Southern soil;''the' Southern

<p>upon any people since God made the world. The seduction of old Eve and Adam by the devil is not a circumstance to secession. The devil seduced only one poor, uneducated woman, and she seduced only one poor, uneducated man; and the beauty of it was, they had no'niggers' to lose,-the issue between the devil and the woman being simply about an apple; the'nigger' question
</p>
<p>was not introduced. But secession has seduced and
</p>
<p>destroyed millions, many of whom are highly educated; Senators, Congressmen, orators, editors, politicians, statesmen, poets, divines, doctors of divinity,
</p>
<p>doctors of medicine, lawyers, and even the common
</p>
<p>class,-the ignorant, uneducated'poor white people,'have all been seduced by secession, and they have lost

<p>and will lose their'niggers' into the bargain.

<p>God in mercy grant that you may view secession in all

<p>its loathsome aspects, and that you may fly from it as

<p>That they must never rest satisfied until negroism is

<p>ment, From all the circumstances connected with the

<p>arrest of these gentlemen, we are inclined to the opinion
</p>
<p>that they were arrested and are held as hostages for
</p>
<p>these Union men, and that they will probably be held
</p>
<p>until the Union prisoners are released. Not having
</p>
<p>heard of any specific charges which have been brought
</p>
<p>against them, we are led to adopt this belief.
</p>
<p>" Immediately on the arrest of these gentlemen, we
</p>
<p>were charged with having had some hand in the
</p>
<p>matter. In justice, therefore, to ourself, we feel it our
</p>
<p>duty to make a few remarks of general explanation,
</p>
<p>which we hope will be satisfactory to the parties and
</p>
<p>set the matter at rest forever. And, as we trust that

<p>this will be the last time that we shall be forced to

<p>"'A reliable citizen of our town informed us, the other

<p>because he did not believe it to be true. We pronounce

</p>
<p>but twice since the Federal army arrived in Falmouth.
</p>
<p>Once we went to General McDowell's head-quarters to
</p>
<p>get a pass to go to Baltimore; but we did not see the
</p>
<p>general, and failed to obtain a pass. Once we visited
</p>
<p>Falmouth, and on our way were introduced to General
</p>
<p>Gibbon at his tent, which was directly in our way to
</p>
<p>Falmouth. What business is it of ours, or why should
</p>
<p>we care, if every clergyman in town should go to
</p>
<p>Richmond and stay there forever?'
</p>
<p>"We shall handle some of the resapectabilities with'gloves off,' if they don't mind how they talk about
</p>
<p>us. We may be'flighty,' as one of the learned M.D.s
</p>
<p>has represented us at head-quarters, but- we wish it to
</p>
<p>be distinctly understood that if we are too'flighty' to
</p>
<p>make pills, we are too stubborn to swallow those compounded and retailed out to strangers for the purpose
</p>
<p>of blasting and damning the influence of the' Christian
</p>
<p>Banner.'
</p>
<p>"Respectabilities must surely judge of the actions
</p>
<p>and doings of Union men by their own acts and doings., Because they try to defame and blast the
</p>
<p>reputation and influence of Union men, they seem to
</p>
<p>think that Union men are constantly engaged in the

<p>same dirty, filthy work. Secession is a hard road to

<p>travel: it leads directly to destruction, and many there

<p>the fact, that Mr. Broaddus had; gone to Richmond,
</p>

</p>
<p>person could go who wished to go. Why, then, should
</p>
<p>we wish to inform General King that Mr. Broaddus
</p>
<p>had gone? We have enough to do to attend to our
</p>
<p>own business, without running with'batches' of news
</p>
<p>to General King to instruct him in the discharge of
</p>
<p>his duties.
</p>
<p>"We mean no disrespect to the clergymen of Fredericksburg when we ask,'What business is it of ours,
</p>
<p>or why should we care, if every clergyman in town
</p>
<p>should go to Richmond and stay there forever?' We
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with the clergy, nor they with us.
</p>
<p>Their systems of religion and politics, and ours, are so
</p>
<p>very dissimilar that they can never approximate and
</p>
<p>harmonize. As to religion, they can go to heaven in
</p>
<p>their own way. We believe in the doctrines and
</p>
<p>Christianity of the Bible. If we fail to get to heaven,
</p>
<p>we shall not lay the blame on the clergy. If they
</p>
<p>should fail to get to heaven, it is to be hoped that they
</p>
<p>will not seek to charge their condemnation on us; for
</p>
<p>God knows we have long and faithfully warned them
</p>
<p>of their danger.
</p>
<p>" When it comes to breaking up our country, however, this is another question. In preaching up their
</p>
<p>own political destruction, they drag us into the same
</p>
<p>whirlpool of perdition with themselves; and to this we
</p>
<p>do most seriously object. And we do argue that if
</p>
<p>they should prove as successful in working out their
</p>
<p>own eternal ruin as they have been in effecting their
</p>
<p>own temporal destruction and that of us all, they are
</p>
<p>gone and lost forever. And, while we wish it to be
</p>
<p>distinctly understood that we do not charge the sin of

<p>secession upon the clergy only, we do say that many of

<p>press last week we learned that it was currently reported in town, and generally believed, that we had

<p>caused the arrest of those gentlemen. This being told

<p>to us by several of our prominent citizens, we wrote

<p>however, that there are those who are still disposed to.
</p>
<p>force the blame of the arrest of those gentlemen upon

<p>relative to certain reports against us, to the effect that
</p>
<p>we had visited General King and informed him that

<p>Dr. Broaddus had gone to Richmond, &c. &c. We disposed of the charge by denouncing it as a base slander

<p>gone to Richmond, and that Captain Mansfield, in reply,' asked' us'if' we'had any business to attend to, and,

<p>go to and return from Richmond at pleasure; that

<p>there is a regular mail kept up between Richmond
</p>
<p>and Fredericksburg; that a quantity of goods have
</p>
<p>been carried out of Fredericksburg supposed to be

<p>made arrangements with the authorities of the Federal Government that Captain Mansfield shall be continued in the office of provost-marshal in Fredericksburg; that a scouting-party brought in from the

<p>gentleman's property was then being guarded by Federal soldiers, and was afterwards continued to be guarded

<p>"While we are on the subject of rumors, we will add
</p>
<p>that it is rumored over town that we went to Washington City last week to see President Lincoln and the
</p>
<p>authorities at the War Department, to get them to turn
</p>
<p>things'upside-down' and to'play the devil' generally
</p>
<p>with the secessionists of Fredericksburg. These are
</p>
<p>all secession lies. We went to Washington for no such
</p>
<p>purpose. We went on business of our own, and that
</p>
<p>of an entirely private character,-simply to get a little
</p>
<p>paper and some other articles which we were bound to
</p>
<p>have. We neither saw, nor went to see, President Lincoln, Secretary Stanton, nor any of the officials at Washington. Surely, secessionists watch us with a'critic's

<p>eye.'
</p>
<p>"While in Washington, at the National Hotel, a

<p>lieutenant in the Federal army informed us that Dr.

<p>maniac. Then, upon the authority of Dr. Scott and

<p>the official authorities at Washington City, or elsewhere, implicating any human being on earth, is an
</p>
<p>infamous liar.
</p>
<p>"There is a great fuss made over the arrest of secessionists; but when Union men were seized and hurried off to prison, nothing was said against the course
</p>
<p>of action pursued by the Confederate authorities. This
</p>
<p>was all right: there was no sympathy for the poor
</p>
<p>wives and children and friends of these Union men.
</p>
<p>Secessionists rejoiced at it, and said the physic was acting, was doing its work well,: &c. &c. Secessionists
</p>
<p>can make their threats against Union men, and say
</p>
<p>what will be done with them when the Southern army
</p>
<p>returns to Fredericksburg, -that they shall be shot, or
</p>
<p>hung, and that they shall never live in this community,
</p>
<p>-and Union men must submit to all these threats and
</p>
<p>every vile indignity and insult that can be offered by
</p>
<p>every worthless poltroon that drags his vile polluted
</p>
<p>carcass through the' streets of Fredericksburg, and
</p>
<p>Union men dare not open their mouths in self-defence,
</p>
<p>for fear of being murdered by the Confederate soldiers
</p>
<p>when they'come back'!
</p>
<p>"We feel truly sorry that these terrible calamities
</p>
<p>have come upon us; but we cannot help it. We sympathize with our fellow-citizens. We warned them of the

</p>
<p>counsel and treated us as an enemy, and still seem
</p>
<p>determined to rush headlong into irretrievable ruin
</p>
<p>and drag every soul after them who will be influenced
</p>
<p>by their ungodly example.
</p>
<p>" In conclusion, we will just state that we have never
</p>
<p>been officious at any of the head-quarters of the Union
</p>
<p>troops since their arrival in Fredericksburg and its
</p>
<p>vicinity, never having visited them except when business absolutely called us there. We have attended
</p>
<p>closely to our own business, and have interrupted no
</p>
<p>one in attending to his. Our sentiments we have written and published in the columns of the'Christian
</p>
<p>Banner,' and for doing this we hold ourself individually responsible. If to be a Union man, a friend
</p>
<p>to our whole country, be a disgrace, then we are disgraced, and we glory in it. If to advocate the cause
</p>
<p>of the Union, and to entreat our fellow-citizens to

<p>respect and observe the Constitution of the Federal
</p>
<p>Government, to the end that our own section, our own
</p>
<p>beloved South, may be saved from total destruction, be

</p>
<p>what, are we a traitor? A traitor to Jeff Davis and
</p>
<p>his accomplices in treason? A traitor to a man who
</p>
<p>was never a candidate for his office before the people
</p>
<p>of any State before the State of Virginia was tied on
</p>
<p>to the' Southern Confederacy'? A traitor to an anticipated Government, known and acknowledged by no

<p>CHAPTER XXXIX.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of July
</p>
<p>30, 1862, we received and copied into the columns of
</p>
<p>the " Christian Banner" the following extract from the
</p>
<p>"Richmond Dispatch" of the 23d of July, 1862, on
</p>
<p>which we made a short editorial, both of which we
</p>
<p>here insert. First the extract:"MISDIRECTED PHILANTHROPY.
</p>
<p>"' We noticed recently statements in Northern
</p>
<p>papers that Messrs. Marye and Slaughter, of Fredericksburg, had left that place to come to Richmond with
</p>
<p>the view of obtaining the release of the Federal Brigadier-General Reynolds, who was captured in one of the
</p>
<p>battles on the Chickahominy. They were said to have
</p>
<p>been induced to do this in gratitude for the liberal and
</p>
<p>considerate manner in which General Reynolds had governed their city while under his command. It was
</p>
<p>further alleged that the citizens of the town, entertaining the same feeling, urged the mission upon them.
</p>
<p>"' It has been more lately stated by the same journals
</p>
<p>that the committee of two had returned, declaring their
</p>
<p>disgust with the Government at Richmond, all access
</p>
<p>to which was closed against them.
</p>
<p>"' Now, we do not believe all that the Yankee papers

</p>
<p>have said on the subject; but we suppose at least so
</p>
<p>THE SOUTHI SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>417
</p>
<p>much is true as relates to the expedition of the gentlemen named to this place. They no doubt stated
</p>
<p>their case to the proper officers; and their appeal was,
</p>
<p>of course, rejected, as it ought to have been. Was not
</p>
<p>General Reynolds in arms against us? Did he not lead
</p>
<p>a brigade of cut-throats to take the lives of our brave
</p>
<p>soldiers, to subjugate us, and take possession of our
</p>
<p>property? Was he not taken in the field fighting
</p>
<p>against us? Why then is he to be entitled to the
</p>
<p>commiseration of the Fredericksburgers and to discharge from the custody of our authorities? If he is
</p>
<p>less a brute and more of a man than some of his colleagues, he cannot be excepted from the treatment due
</p>
<p>an enemy, though he may be less execrated. But he
</p>
<p>is in very bad company, and must take pot-luck with
</p>
<p>them. The people of Fredericksburg may run over
</p>
<p>with gratitude, but nobody will be lost in admiration
</p>
<p>of the good sense displayed in the commission to this
</p>
<p>city in behalf of the man who led so many Yankees to
</p>
<p>desolate our country.'
</p>
<p>"From the above it will be seen that the authorities
</p>
<p>at Richmond have very little sympathy for General
</p>
<p>Reynolds, notwithstanding all his kindness to the
</p>
<p>citizens of Fredericksburg. Surely, if the leaders in
</p>
<p>the Confederate army were sincere, and believed that
</p>
<p>they were telling the truth, when they delineated all
</p>
<p>the crimes of abomination which the Union troops
</p>
<p>would perpetrate against women and citizens generally
</p>
<p>whenever and wherever they advanced into the country,
</p>
<p>they ought to feel thankful to God and to the Federal
</p>
<p>officers that the people in Fredericksburg have been

<p>dealt with so tenderly. But General Reynolds'is in

</p>
<p>very bad company, and, if he is less a brute and more
</p>
<p>of a man than some of his colleagues, he must take
</p>
<p>pot-luck with them.' This is the gratitude of the
</p>
<p>officials at Richmond for all the kindness shown to
</p>
<p>the citizens of Fredericksburg by General Reynolds.
</p>
<p>Wonder what they would do with some of the other
</p>
<p>kind, sympathizing Federal officers if they had them
</p>
<p>in Richmond! They would have to take'pot-luck'
</p>
<p>too, we guess."
</p>
<p>CHAPTER. XL.
</p>
<p>IN the number of the "Christian Banner" of July
</p>
<p>30, 1862, we published the following editorial:"OATH OF ALLEGIANCE.
</p>
<p>"The late order of General Pope has fallen like a
</p>
<p>thunderbolt from a clear sky on the citizens of this
</p>
<p>community. As long as they were allowed to talk
</p>
<p>treason against the Federal Government and threaten
</p>
<p>vengeance against Union men with impunity, they
</p>
<p>thought matters were going on very nicely. But when
</p>
<p>it comes to swearing,-to taking the oath of allegiance
</p>
<p>to respect and support the Government which has protected them and all they possess from their cradles up
</p>
<p>to the time of this unprovoked rebellion,-they begin
</p>
<p>to look with wonder and astonishment. And this becomes the more terrible when they look at the dread
</p>
<p>penalty which is annexed to the oath if not respected
</p>
<p>by those who take it.

<p>419
</p>
<p>scientiously take the oath and honestly observe it. But
</p>
<p>we learn that there are some who declare they cannot
</p>
<p>and will not take it. They say,'It is hard for men to
</p>
<p>be forced from their homes.' Yes: this, we admit, is
</p>
<p>very hard; but then, on the other hand, it is very hard
</p>
<p>that a country like ours should be broken up by a set
</p>
<p>of unprincipled, aspiring demagogues. It is very hard
</p>
<p>that millions of soldiers should be forced to leave their
</p>
<p>quiet, peaceful homes, their wives and children, their
</p>
<p>fathers and mothers, and all the blessings and comforts
</p>
<p>of life at home, and peril their lives in camp, on the
</p>
<p>battle-field, and die far away from home, friends, and
</p>
<p>relatives, all on account of the diabolical ambition of a
</p>
<p>few wicked, God-forsaken usurpers. It is very hard
</p>
<p>that our country should be desolated, and all our privileges, social, religious, and political, should be destroyed, by a set of disappointed tyrants. It is very
</p>
<p>hard that our dear sons, whom we love as we do our
</p>
<p>own heart's blood, should be immolated upon the accursed altar of a band of ambitious traitors. All these
</p>
<p>things are hard,-yes, very hard; and yet the leaders
</p>
<p>who forced this state of things upon the country think
</p>
<p>it very hard that they should be subject to any inconveniences or losses during the whole rebellion.

<p>"But men talk about'property' in this- matter.
</p>
<p>What true-hearted patriot would throw his country

<p>into one end of the balance and a few goods and chattels into the other end, and then hesitate a moment

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>our property, and, it may be, our lives into the bargain.'
</p>
<p>" Well, suppose you do not take the oath of allegiance:
</p>
<p>you will forfeit all your property by refusing to take
</p>
<p>the oath and by going outside of the Federal lines; and
</p>
<p>if the Confederates return all your property will be
</p>
<p>destroyed anyway, except, perhaps, the ground upon
</p>
<p>which your houses stand: hence, if you go against
</p>
<p>your country, you will certainly lose all your property,
</p>
<p>and may-be your lives into the bargain, and, worse
</p>
<p>than all, you may die fighting against your own dear,
</p>
<p>heaven-blessed country.
</p>
<p>"By taking the oath of allegiance to the Constitution and support of the Federal Government, men may
</p>
<p>save their honor, their property, their lives, and their
</p>
<p>country. And, remember what we say, this is but
</p>
<p>the beginning of the evils that are yet to come upon
</p>
<p>us if we continue in a state of ungodly rebellion.
</p>
<p>Men may stand upon their affected dignity until they
</p>
<p>see their country crushed, but dignified and titled
</p>
<p>pride will fall into muddy waters before this rebellion

<p>ends. If there should be a doubt, therefore, in the

<p>mind of any one as to what course he should pursue,

<p>"VIRGINIANS, PREPARE FOR THE WORST!
</p>
<p>"'Tis hard for those who have labored and toiled for
</p>
<p>years in order to accumulate the necessaries of life, and
</p>
<p>who by the most rigid economy, and in many instances
</p>
<p>by the greatest self-denial, have secured a competency
</p>
<p>of this world's goods to sustain them in the decline
</p>
<p>of life and old age, to have it all swept from them, as
</p>
<p>it were, in a single day. But such is:the present state
</p>
<p>of things. And, what is most provoking, the innocent

</p>
<p>involved Virginia in universal and inextricable ruin.
</p>
<p>The great wealth of Virginia, and especially of Eastern

<p>Virginia, consisted principally in her slave population.
</p>
<p>This portion of her wealth is irrecoverably lost. To

<p>and from their former masters they are gone forever!

<p>That the whole of the slave population in Eastern Virginia, with the exception of a few old, superannuated

</p>
<p>Then it is certain that by far the greatest portion of
</p>
<p>the wealth of Virginia is already lost! lost! lost!
</p>
<p>"Real estate is the next species of property which
</p>
<p>is the most valuable in Virginia. To say nothing of
</p>
<p>the confiscation law, the landed estates in Virginia
</p>
<p>will, before the war ends, diminish at least one-half
</p>
<p>or one-third their original value. What will farms be
</p>
<p>worth without enclosures, houses, and even destitute
</p>
<p>of timber in many instances to rebuild them? The
</p>
<p>whole country desolated, houses torn down, fences destroyed, negroes gone, and most of the white male population either dead or wounded and disabled for life.
</p>
<p>This will be the condition, the destiny, of Virginia,
</p>
<p>when this war shall have closed; and no sensible man
</p>
<p>will controvert it.
</p>
<p>"In connection with this subject, we would ask, what
</p>
<p>is the money worth which is now in circulation in Virginia? Confederate notes are worth nothing outside
</p>
<p>of the Confederate lines, and are worth nothing inside
</p>
<p>of the Confederate lines except for present purposes;
</p>
<p>and, let the success of the war be what it may, Confederate notes, as we have often said, can never be redeemed. This money will ultimately be a dead loss to
</p>
<p>individuals who have it on hand. Even Virginia
</p>
<p>money is greatly below par now; and what it will
</p>
<p>finally be worth is altogether a matter of wild speculation.

</p>
<p>raised the present year, will soon be eaten up and consumed, and but little preparations are being made for

</p>
<p>citizens of Virginia during the next eighteen months
</p>
<p>or two years? Terribly dark is the picture to contemplate; and, in addition to all this, there are many
</p>
<p>calamities more fearful than any yet named, and of
</p>
<p>which we tremble to think, and forbear to mention, but
</p>
<p>which will certainly befall us if this wicked rebellion
</p>
<p>continues. And we repeat that, in the face of all these
</p>
<p>things, many of our citizens continue fixed, firm, and
</p>
<p>steadfast in their course of rebellion,-determined, if
</p>
<p>possible, to break up the Government, annihilate the
</p>
<p>Republic, and establish the reign of anarchy, guerrilla
</p>
<p>despotism, and terror, all over the land. We do most
</p>
<p>devoutly pray that those of our fellow-citizens who are
</p>
<p>not given entirely over to judicial blindness, hardness
</p>
<p>of heart, and reprobacy of mind, will think more seriously, calmly, and dispassionately, and withal more

<p>sensibly, on this subject, and renounce and denounce

<p>this most unholy rebellion, and return to their duty as

<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XLVII,
</p>
<p>"WONDERFUL TO TELL.
</p>
<p>"ON last Saturday morning our attention was called
</p>
<p>to a crowd of contrabands, which by far surpassed
</p>
<p>any thing we have seen during the war. An elegant
</p>
<p>carriage, drawn by two splendid horses, came rolling
</p>
<p>into town, and halted in front of General Patrick's
</p>
<p>head-quarters. Being induced by curiosity to look into
</p>
<p>the interior of the carriage, we discovered that it was
</p>
<p>thoroughly filled with female contrabands and children.
</p>
<p>The women were sitting up, fanning themselves, and
</p>
<p>looking as aristocratic as if they belonged to the'first
</p>
<p>families of Virginia,' and no doubt but what they had;
</p>
<p>but, alas! the primitive glory was rapidly departing,
</p>
<p>as it is from most of the proud, aristocratic first families of Virginia, that good old State, sacrificed on the
</p>
<p>unhallowed altar of would-be petty tyrants and contemptible demagogues. The whole retinue belonging
</p>
<p>to the carriage, including the driver and a companion
</p>
<p>seated by his side, numbered ten contrabands in all.
</p>
<p>We learned from the party that the carriage and
</p>
<p>horses belonged to Mr. -, of Caroline county, who'had' been their master, and who was at.home when
</p>
<p>they left, and was, perhaps, asleep, as they skedaddled
</p>
<p>while it was yet dark.
</p>
<p>"In company with the carriage-party there was- an
</p>
<p>ox-cart, drawn by four large, fat oxen, filled with furniture, and about fifteen women and small children on

<p>top. There were others on horseback. In all, we

<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>431
</p>
<p>learned that there were between twenty and thirty
</p>
<p>contrabands, all of whom had belonged to one man, as
</p>
<p>did also the carriage and horses, and cart and oxen,
</p>
<p>and all left the owner in one single night! The whole
</p>
<p>lot of negroes, carriage and horses, cart and oxen,
</p>
<p>three years ago would have commanded in actual cash,
</p>
<p>at the lowest calculation, twenty-five thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>and all gone in a single night!
</p>
<p>"Virginians are being reduced to the most abject
</p>
<p>poverty. This, we must remind the reader, is a part
</p>
<p>and parcel of the promised glories of secession. Let
</p>
<p>the wise leaders in the damning work of secession now
</p>
<p>come forward before the dearpeople,-the hard-working
</p>
<p>yeomanry of Virginia, and give an account of their
</p>
<p>stewardship. How the citizens of Virginia can longer
</p>
<p>tolerate these men, who must be either fools or knaves,
</p>
<p>or both, is one of the riddles of riddles to us, and
</p>
<p>one which we cannot solve, except upon the principle of the old Roman adage,'Whom the gods intend to destroy they first make mad.' And still the
</p>
<p>dear people seem bent and determined on following
</p>
<p>their political and spiritual guides, even if they land
</p>
<p>them in temporal and eternal ruin.
</p>
<p>"Great numbers of contrabands are flocking into
</p>
<p>town, more for the last few days than usual, owing, we
</p>
<p>suppose, to the report that the Southern army is returning to town, and the negroes are trying to make
</p>
<p>their final exit before it arrives.

<p>CHAPTER XLVIII.
</p>
<p>"'I NEVER EXPECTED IT WOULD COME TO THIS.'
</p>
<p>"A GENTLEMAN and a friend of ours from the country
</p>
<p>observed to us in our office the other day, in course of
</p>
<p>conversation on the gloomy appearance of affairs, that
</p>
<p>he'had no idea things would turn out as they have,'
</p>
<p>when he was advocating secession and when he'voted
</p>
<p>for it.' With a deep sigh, and a downcast look, he
</p>
<p>exclaimed,'I never expected it would come to this.''No,' he added,'I never expected this.' Thousands
</p>
<p>can say the same thing now. Why, then, hold on to
</p>
<p>the abominable doctrine of secession,-the abomination
</p>
<p>of desolation? Why not abandon the accursed evil,
</p>
<p>and at once take a decided stand in the ranks of loyal

<p>citizens?
</p>
<p>"The leaders in this rebellion had no idea themselves
</p>
<p>that things would turn out as they have done. If men
</p>
<p>had honestly and without a doubt believed that secession would have caused the death of their dear children,
</p>

<p>and Abolitionists, and have forced them to vote whether
</p>

</p>
<p>433
</p>
<p>they wished to do so or not? Common sense says, No;
</p>
<p>every sympathy of humanity says, No. These same men
</p>
<p>are daily and hourly seeing and feeling the results of
</p>
<p>secession; and we now tell them plainly that the half
</p>
<p>has not been seen and felt unless they renounce their
</p>
<p>rebellion and return into the Union and do their duty
</p>
<p>as loyal citizens.
</p>
<p>"Men see and feel the blasting, withering, and desolating effects of secession everywhere, and still they
</p>
<p>persist in saying,'We'll soon whip them out; we'll
</p>
<p>have Washington soon; we'll get all our negroes back,
</p>
<p>or get well paid for them; we'll keep fighting on until
</p>
<p>the last man in the South is killed out; we'd rather
</p>
<p>see every thing in ashes, every soldier killed, the
</p>
<p>whole country annihilated, than ever to return again
</p>
<p>into the Union.'
</p>
<p>"'Was ever such folly and madness heard of, read of,
</p>
<p>or thought of, since God made man, as the folly and
</p>
<p>madness which spring from secession?
</p>
<p>I' I never expected it would come to this.' Thousands can now say this, and they are saying it every
</p>
<p>day, We never expected'it would come to this.' No:
</p>
<p>the champion leaders, the arch-traitors in this terrible
</p>
<p>rebellion are as much disappointed in their calculations
</p>
<p>and expectations as are the great body of the people
</p>
<p>whom they have deceived. They never expected things
</p>
<p>would take the course and produce the results which
</p>
<p>they have done. Virginians never expected to see their
</p>
<p>beautiful towns desolated, their farms laid waste,
</p>
<p>their property scattered like chaff before the wind,
</p>
<p>their slaves leaving them at will and marching off

</p>
<p>expected that Virginia would become the battle-field
</p>
<p>and the burial-ground of a great national revolution.
</p>
<p>No: Virginians never expected any of these things.
</p>
<p>"Six months ago, the secessionists in our town laughed
</p>
<p>at the idea that the Union troops would ever get to
</p>
<p>Fredericksburg. They never expected things would
</p>
<p>come to what they have; and it would have been dangerous for any one to have predicted the present state
</p>
<p>of affairs in town. They now see with their eyes
</p>
<p>and hear with their ears; but all seems to make little
</p>
<p>or no impression on their minds and hearts for the
</p>
<p>better. They see with their eyes, but cannot perceive;
</p>
<p>they hear with their ears, but cannot understand.
</p>
<p>They obstinately refuse to contemplate the ultimate result of things dispassionately and impartially. If this
</p>
<p>rebellion should continue twelve months or two or
</p>
<p>three years longer, the horrible scenes which will be
</p>
<p>acted out will be without a parallel in the history of
</p>
<p>the world. The simple circumstance of slaves leaving
</p>
<p>their owners will be regarded as an insignificant trifle
</p>
<p>compared with other things which will happen.

<p>" The whole colored population of Virginia is becoming
</p>
<p>alarmingly demoralized; the spirit of insubordination
</p>
<p>and rebellion against the authority of their masters
</p>
<p>is constantly being demonstrated in our midst. This is
</p>
<p>obvious to all persons. There are but few white men
</p>
<p>in Virginia apart from the army, except old men and
</p>
<p>invalids. The most of the white male population of

<p>Virginia is in the Southern army. When, therefore,

</p>
<p>PREVIOUS to the arrival of the Federal troops in the
</p>
<p>town of Fredericksburg and its vicinity, secessionists
</p>
<p>had reported that wherever the Union troops went, they
</p>
<p>committed all kinds of depredations and outrages on
</p>
<p>the property and persons of citizens. Hence the

<p>general panic among the people generally, and the

</p>
<p>advance of the Union troops on Fredericksburg in
</p>
<p>April, 1862. Instead, however, of the depredations and
</p>
<p>outrages being perpetrated which most of the citizens
</p>
<p>seemed to have anticipated, the officers appeared to do
</p>
<p>every thing reasonable and consistent with their position to conciliate the good feelings of the citizens. Private property was not only respected, but assiduously
</p>
<p>guarded by the troops, and men were encouraged to
</p>
<p>attend to their lawful, usual avocations. But we are
</p>
<p>sorry to say that the very kindness of the Federal
</p>
<p>troops seemed only to provoke the leading secessionists
</p>
<p>to feelings of greater vindictiveness than ever, if possible,
</p>
<p>against the officers, the soldiers, and the Federal Government, and certainly more so against the Union citizens of the town. The reader may judge of the order
</p>
<p>observed in the town of Fredericksburg from the following editorials which we published in the "Banner,"
</p>
<p>and which if they had not been true would have been
</p>
<p>contradicted by all parties:"We have lived in Fredericksburg sixteen years,
</p>
<p>and have never witnessed our town more quiet, during
</p>
<p>the whole time, than it has been since the arrival of
</p>
<p>the Federal army. General Patrick is certainly a fine
</p>
<p>disciplinarian, and his men know how to deport themselves. We sincerely hope that quiet and good order
</p>
<p>will continue; and we confidently believe they will, so
</p>
<p>long as General Patrick and his command remain."Christian Banner, May 27, 1862.

<p>The following brief paragraph may explain the

<p>reason why we threw out the "friendly hint" of which

</p>
<p>have heard it suggested, however, that none of the

<p>ladies belonging to the 6lite class of the community
</p>
<p>have manifested such stupidity. Of course, none but

<p>the lower class, the poor, uneducated, would be guilty

<p>States?" Simply because Union men have not confidence in the ability of the Federal army to hold the
</p>
<p>TIE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>449
</p>
<p>territory which they take. For example: if the Union
</p>
<p>men in Fredericksburg could have known positively
</p>
<p>that the town never would have been evacuated by the
</p>
<p>Union troops, and that the Confederate army would
</p>
<p>never have returned there, then there would have been
</p>
<p>a much stronger Union element developed at once than
</p>
<p>there has been since. This we positively know to be
</p>
<p>correct.
</p>
<p>It was reported by secessionists on the arrival of the
</p>
<p>Union troops at Fredericksburg, in April, 1862, that
</p>
<p>there were not more than one or two Union men in
</p>
<p>town,-that the whole community was a unit on secession; and this, as we were informed, was the impression constantly sought to be made on the minds of the
</p>
<p>Union troops by secessionists; when, in fact, nothing
</p>
<p>was more false. When General Burnside evacuated
</p>
<p>the town, there were more than fifty men who left Fredericksburg and its vicinity on account of their Union
</p>
<p>sentiments.' A number of others, who were as true to
</p>
<p>the Union at heart, no doubt, as those who left, were,
</p>
<p>by force of circumstances, compelled to remain, but,
</p>
<p>not having committed themselves so thoroughly, hoped
</p>
<p>to be able to escape the penalties for treason against
</p>
<p>Jeff Davis and the Southern Confederacy; and we hope
</p>
<p>they have escaped punishment. We were truly sorry
</p>
<p>for them, and deeply regretted that they could not
</p>
<p>leave when we did.
</p>
<p>Secessionists, knowing that they are above suspicion
</p>
<p>with their own party, and holding all the offices in
</p>
<p>towns and communities, are always first and foremost to
</p>
<p>impose themselves on the Federal troops when the latter
</p>
<p>advance into the territory of the rebellion. Whereas

<p>TH-E CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>by: secessionists, act, as a general rule, with more reserve. And hence the first impressions that are made
</p>
<p>on the minds of the Union troops for the most part
</p>
<p>when they first enter a community, are made by secessionists, who declare that there is no "respectable
</p>
<p>Union" influence in the community. And afterwards,
</p>
<p>if loyal men express Union sentiments, Union troops
</p>
<p>think they are dissembling, and will perhaps give them
</p>
<p>the "cold shoulder," which disheartens the Union
</p>
<p>citizens and tends to crush out the loyal feelings which
</p>
<p>they have.
</p>
<p>Especially are Union men intimidated when they see
</p>
<p>no difference made between themselves and the most
</p>
<p>violent secessionists by the officers of the Federal army,
</p>
<p>and hearing it repeated that the "Yankees don't think
</p>
<p>half as much of Union men as they do of secessionists,"
</p>
<p>because they believe they are "' hypocrites;" and, fearing that the Union soldiers will leave, and that the
</p>
<p>Confederates will return, they are awed into submission
</p>
<p>by the infernal rod of tyranny which is constantly
</p>
<p>being held over them by secessionists, who threaten
</p>
<p>what shall be done to them and with them "' when the
</p>
<p>time comes.". We are not guessing at things now, but
</p>
<p>writing what we believe and know to be facts. There
</p>
<p>are numbers of Union men all through the seceded
</p>
<p>States who are afraid to commit themselves, knowing
</p>
<p>the terrible consequences which would follow if they
</p>
<p>should be suspicioned, reported, and convicted by their
</p>
<p>secesh neighbors of disloyalty to Jeff Davis and the
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy. - The people know that they

</p>
<p>have been swindled out of all their rights and privileges, but they know, likewise, that they have no redress under present circumstances,-and must therefore
</p>
<p>THE SOUTH SACRIFICED.
</p>
<p>451
</p>
<p>submit in silence to the many ten thousand wrongs
</p>
<p>which have been forced and heaped upon them. They
</p>
<p>scorn secession, and hate it worse than they can hate the
</p>
<p>very devil himself. But they can't help themselves.
</p>
<p>What can they do but submit?
</p>
<p>The Union feeling in the South is very considerable,
</p>
<p>and should be sacredly respected and encouraged by
</p>
<p>the United States Government. Suppose this rebellion
</p>
<p>should not be put down, and that Jeff Davis should
</p>
<p>succeed in permanently establishing his empire: what
</p>
<p>will become of the Union men of the South and of the
</p>
<p>thousands of refugees who have been driven from their
</p>
<p>homes and families and forced to leave all their property, and every interest they have on earth, behind?
</p>
<p>Must they all become totally bankrupt, and return to
</p>
<p>live among a people to be insulted, persecuted, proscribed, and degraded, they and their children, forever? The thought is revolting. What then? Must
</p>
<p>they, by force of circumstances, seek new countries and
</p>
<p>begin the world anew with all the infirmities of age and
</p>
<p>helpless families? Surely this cannot be, unless justice
</p>
<p>has taken its everlasting flight from the abode of
</p>
<p>mortals.
</p>
<p>But this is not all. Should-the United States Government fail to crush out this rebellion, the whole
</p>
<p>country in process of time will become disintegrated
</p>
<p>and broken up, so that not only the Union men of the
</p>
<p>South, but the whole of the free States, will become the
</p>
<p>vassals of this great negro-oligarchy. Hence it becomes a question of dignified importance for the most
</p>
<p>serious and profound consideration of the people of the
</p>
<p>free-States, as well as of the Union men and refugees

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>We, therefore, argue that with all true patriots and
</p>
<p>friends of liberty there should be but one party, until
</p>
<p>this gigantic and wicked rebellion is put down; and
</p>
<p>that party should be the uncompromising Union party.
</p>
<p>Let all other subjects and questions for the time-being
</p>
<p>be merged into this one all-absorbing consideration,
</p>
<p>the salvation of the Union. Let every lover of freedom,
</p>
<p>every friend to his country, and every friend to
</p>
<p>humanity say, The Union must and shall be preserved.
</p>
<p>If this be not done, then America will become a land
</p>
<p>of slaves indeed. Let the negro question in this great
</p>
<p>struggle be forgotten, and let the whole race be transported to Africa when the proper time comes, where
</p>
<p>they now ought to be, and from whence they should
</p>
<p>never have been brought. We can live, thank God,
</p>
<p>without negroes to wait upon us, but we cannot live
</p>
<p>without a country! With true patriots this is no war
</p>
<p>about the "infernal nigger." No: it is a war between
</p>
<p>despotism and freedom,-between tyrants who are seeking to overthrow the Republic and all the rights of
</p>
<p>freemen, and the friends of liberty, who are fighting
</p>
<p>and trying to save them. The question is not whether
</p>
<p>negroes shall be made free, but whether free white men
</p>
<p>shall be made slaves! This is the question, when fairly
</p>
<p>stated and correctly understood. Give us poverty,
</p>
<p>but give us freedom! Heap labor and toil upon us,
</p>
<p>but let them be made tolerable by the blessing of freedom. Strip us of all the plunder and trash of earth,
</p>
<p>but as long as heaven's own light shall shine upon our
</p>
<p>path, and the branches of the tree of American liberty
</p>
<p>shall wave over our head, securing to us the freedom

<p>of action, we can endure all the ills of life. In a
</p>
<p>word, give us liberty, or give uts death.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would say to the people of the
</p>
<p>South, You confided in your political leaders and
</p>
<p>spiritual guides, and they abused your confidence.
</p>
<p>They deceived you, and their deception, consummated,
</p>
<p>has involved our country in civil war, has desolated
</p>
<p>Virginia, and sacrificed the South upon the accursed
</p>
<p>altar of their unhallowed ambition. If they did this
</p>
<p>thing ignorantly, they are no longer worthy of your
</p>
<p>confidence; and if they did it knowingly, they are less
</p>
<p>worthy of it: so that under no circumstances are they
</p>
<p>worthy of your regard. They forced upon you secession, revolution, and civil war. They promised you
</p>
<p>peace, and have given you war; they promised you
</p>
<p>plenty, and have given you destitution; they promised
</p>
<p>you independence and freedom, and have fastened
</p>
<p>upon you military despotism; they promised you a
</p>
<p>permanent basis for the security and perpetuity of
</p>
<p>your slave property, and have virtually emancipated
</p>
<p>all your slaves; they promised you prosperity and
</p>
<p>happiness, and have given you desolation, lamentation,
</p>
<p>and woe; they promised you national honor, and
</p>
<p>have forced upon you national degradation; they
</p>
<p>promised you day, and have given you night; they
</p>
<p>promised you light, and have given you darkness;
</p>
<p>they promised you bread, and have given you stones;
</p>
<p>they promised you fishes, and have given you scorpions; they promised you life, and have given you
</p>
<p>death. All these things have your leaders done.
</p>
<p>They have deceived you, swindled you out of your

<p>454
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY UNVEILED.
</p>
<p>denounce secession as a deadly poison, and return
</p>
<p>to your former loyalty to your country. Save the
</p>
<p>Union, and you save the South; destroy the Union,
</p>
<p>and you destroy the South. Stand by the Union until
</p>
<p>you die,-not that you love the South less, but the
</p>
<p>Union more. League not with speculators, bankers,
</p>
<p>stock-holders, involved merchants, disappointed officeseekers, aspiring demagogues, ambitious tyrants, political tricksters, clerical knaves, and damnable traitors,
</p>
<p>to overthrow the Government, to destroy the Union,
</p>
<p>and to annihilate the South.
