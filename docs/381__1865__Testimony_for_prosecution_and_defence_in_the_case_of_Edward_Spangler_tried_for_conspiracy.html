<p>BEFORE A

</p>
<p>PRESIDENT, WASHINGTON, D. C, MAY AND JUNE, 1865
</p>
<p>THOMAS EWING, Jr., Counsel for the Accused.
</p>
<p>MAY It.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Joseph M. Dye,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate;
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, on the evening of
</p>
<p>the 14th of April last, you were in from of
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre, and at what hour you were
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>A. I was sitting in front of Ford's Theatre
</p>
<p>about half-past nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe several persons, whose
</p>
<p>appearance excited your suspicions, confer-
</p>
<p>ring together upon the pavement in front of
</p>
<p>the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe their appearance, and what
</p>
<p>they did.
</p>
<p>. A. The first appearance was an elegantly
</p>
<p>.'sd,ressed gentleman, who came put of the pas-
</p>
<p>"sage, and commenced conversing with a ruf-
</p>
<p>tiauly-looking fellow. Then there was an-
</p>
<p>other one appeared, and the three conversed
</p>
<p>together. After they had conversed together,
</p>
<p>it was drawing near the second act. The one
</p>
<p>that appeared to be the leader of them, the
</p>
<p>M ell-dressed one, said, " 1 think he will come
</p>
<p>posed.

</p>
<p> out now," referring to the President, I sup-
</p>
<p>Q. Was the President's carriage standing
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. One of them had been stand-
</p>
<p>ing out, looking at the carriage on the curb-
</p>
<p>stone, while 1 was sitting there, and then
</p>
<p>went back. They watched a while, and the
</p>
<p>rusb came down; many gentlemen came out
</p>
<p>and went in and had a drink in the saloon
</p>
<p>below. Then, after they went up, the best-
</p>
<p>dressed gentleman stepped into the saloon
</p>
<p>himself; remained there long enough to get
</p>
<p>a drink, and came out in a style as if heXViag^
</p>
<p>becoming intoxicated. He stepped up afid
</p>
<p>whispered to this ruffian, (that is, the mis-
</p>
<p>erablest-looking one of the three,) and step-
</p>
<p>ped into the passage  the passage that leads
</p>
<p>to the stage there from the street. Then the
</p>
<p>smallest one stepped up and called the time,
</p>
<p>just as the best aressed gentleman appeared
</p>
<p>again, from the clock in the vestibule. Then
</p>
<p>he started up the street, and remained there
</p>
<p>a while, and came down again, and called
</p>
<p>the time again. Then I began to think there
</p>
<p>was something going on, and looked towards
</p>
<p>this man as he called the time. Presently he
</p>
<p>went up again, and came down then and
</p>
<p>called the time again. Then I began to think
</p>
<p>there was something going on, and I looked
</p>
<p>towards the man as he called the time. Pre-
</p>
<p>sently he went up again, and then came down
</p>
<p>and called the time louder. I think it was
</p>
<p>ten minutes after ten that he called out then.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he announcing it to the other two ?
</p>
<p>.513
</p>
<p>Q. What restaurant did that man go into
</p>
<p>to drink?
</p>
<p>A. The restaurant just below the theatre,
</p>
<p>towards the avenue.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he go in alone?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; he went in alone.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you give a more particular de-
</p>
<p>scription of the ruffianly-looking man, whom
</p>
<p>you saw? What was his size? and what was
</p>
<p>it that gave him such a ruffianly appearance ?
</p>
<p>Was it his dress?
</p>
<p>A. He was not as well dressed as the rest
</p>
<p>of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Was be shabbily dressed or dirtily
</p>
<p>dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. His clothes had been worn a consider-
</p>
<p>able time, and he bad a bloated appear-
</p>
<p>ance.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a stout man?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, and a rough face.
</p>
<p>Q. Which way did he go ?
</p>
<p>A. He remained there at the passage, and
</p>
<p>the other one started up the street.
</p>
<p>Q. The time was announced to the other
</p>
<p>two men three times by him, was it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, three times.
</p>
<p>Q. The last, you think, was ten minutes
</p>
<p>after ten ?
</p>
<p>A. The last time he called out was ten
</p>
<p>minutes after ten.
</p>
<p>Q. Immediately on announcing that, did
</p>
<p>Booth leave and go into the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. He whispered to the ruffian and started
</p>
<p>in.

</p>
<p>Q. Look at these prisoners and see whether
</p>
<p>you recognize any of them as either of the
</p>
<p>persons present on that occasion?
</p>
<p>A. If that man [pointing to Edw'd Spang-
</p>
<p>ler] had a moustache, it wouid be just the
</p>
<p>appearance of the face exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean that the rough looking
</p>
<p>man was like him, except that he had a mous-
</p>
<p>tache ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He was standing at the en-
</p>
<p>trance of the passage, but I think he had a
</p>
<p>moustache, a heavy one. It was rather dark
</p>
<p>back there; the gas-light did not shine very
</p>
<p>much on it, but I saw the moustache.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to state that the call
</p>
<p>was made from the clock in the hall of the
</p>
<p>theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He stepped up there and called
</p>
<p>the time right in trout of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you tell at what time the other
</p>
<p>calls were made ? You have stated that the
</p>
<p>last was at ten minutes past ten.
</p>
<p>A. They were all between half-past nine
</p>
<p>and ten minutes after ten.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you could recognize
</p>
<p>either of the other persons?
</p>
<p>A. The one that called the time was a very
</p>
<p>neat gentleman, well-dressed and he had a
</p>
<p>moustache.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you see him here ?
</p>
<p>A. He was better dressed than any I see
</p>
<p>here. He had on one of the fashionable hats
</p>
<p>they wear here in Washington, with round
</p>
<p>tops and stiff brim.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you describe his dress as to color
</p>
<p>Q. Had he an overcoat on?
</p>
<p>A. 1 did not observe that.
</p>
<p>Q. Do yoii recollect anything as to the
</p>
<p>color of the coat?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; he did not move around, and
</p>
<p>I did not pay any particular attention, only
</p>
<p>that I observed the well-dressed gentleman
</p>
<p>would whisper to him ; that was all.
</p>
<p>Q. Exactly where did he stand ?
</p>
<p>A. Right at the passage.
</p>
<p>Q. Inside?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; right at the end of the pas-
</p>
<p>sage.
</p>
<p>Q. On the pavement?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Near the President's carriage?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; the President's carriage was
</p>
<p>at the curb-stone.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he occupy the same position dur-
</p>
<p>ing the whole of this time?
</p>
<p>A. That man did.
</p>
<p>Q. You refer to the man of slouched
</p>
<p>dress ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Which way did Booth enter the last
</p>
<p>time?
</p>
<p>A. He just stepped right up into the front
</p>
<p>door.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the man in slouched dress
</p>
<p>standing there at that time?
</p>
<p>A. "When Booth whispered to him and left
</p>
<p>him, I did not see him change his position,
</p>
<p>because I was observing Booth. As soon as
</p>
<p>Booth stepped into the theatre, we started.
</p>
<p>The other man started on a fast walk up the

<p>street,
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether the man in
</p>
<p>the slouched dress did not come out on the
</p>
<p>pavement before Booth went out?
</p>
<p>A, I do not recollect his coming out on the
</p>
<p>pavement.
</p>
<p>Q. What attracted your attention to that
</p>
<p>man ?
</p>
<p>A. This elegantly-dressed, gentlemanly-
</p>
<p>looking man addressing him.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you notice him speak to him
</p>
<p>first?
</p>
<p>A. When I first came there.
</p>
<p>Q. At about twenty-five minutes past nine
</p>
<p>or half-past nine?
</p>
<p>A Yes, sir.'
</p>
<p>Q. How long after Booth entered the thea-
</p>
<p>tre was it that you heard the news of the as-
</p>
<p>sassination?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot state the precise time.
</p>
<p>Q. About what time?
</p>
<p>A. Well, fifteen minutes, I presume.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think it was as long as that?
</p>
<p>A. It might not have been as long, but I
</p>
<p>cannot be certain.
</p>
<p>Q. What did yoa do in the meantime?
</p>
<p>A. We started, turned the corner, went
</p>
<p>into a saloon ; debated a while which saloon
</p>
<p>to go to. I do not know how long it took
</p>
<p>us. We had just got in and ordered oysters,
</p>
<p>as a man came in telling us the news.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think it was not exceeding fif-
</p>
<p>teen minutes?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think it may have been less?
</p>
<p>that he came there to the theatre, walked in, |
</p>
<p>and walked out again, and he returned, I
</p>
<p>judge, in about two or three minutes. He
</p>
<p>carne to me and asked me what time it was.
</p>
<p>I told him to step into the lobby that leads I
</p>
<p>out into the street, acd he could see. He i
</p>
<p>stepped out, and walked in again and stepped
</p>
<p>into the door that leads to the parquette and j
</p>
<p>dress circle, and returned immediately, came
</p>
<p>out, and went up the stairway to the dress
</p>
<p>circle. The last I saw of him was, he alight-
</p>
<p>ed on the stage from the box, running across j
</p>
<p>the stage with a knife in his hand. He was j
</p>
<p>uttering some sentence, but I could not un- |
</p>
<p>derstand it well at the time ; I was too far '
</p>
<p>back from him, at the front door.
</p>
<p>Q. He went into the President's box, did ,
</p>
<p>he?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say.
</p>
<p>Q. He was on that side of the dress circle?
</p>
<p>A. I was down below, underneath. The
</p>
<p>dress circle extends over my doorway, so that
</p>
<p>1 could not see.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; knowing him at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. You have known him?
</p>
<p>A. I hare known him to be there at the
</p>
<p>theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him enter or come out of
</p>
<p>the front o'f the theatre during the play?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Stale the position of your box. Is it
</p>
<p>that you would be likely to see any persons

</p>
<p>who entered from the front of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; every person has to pass me
</p>
<p>on entering the theatre ; that is, in the low-
</p>
<p>er part, for the parquette, dress circle, and
</p>
<p>orchestra.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you observe the persons that go in?
</p>
<p>A. No, I do not take notice of the persons.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you see that persons do not go in
</p>
<p>who are not authorized to do so?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. If this man Spangler had gone in from
</p>
<p>the street, entering at the front of the thea-
</p>
<p>tre, would you likely have seen him?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. "Would you have been pretty sure to see
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. Yfs, sir, he could not have passed me
</p>
<p>without my seeing him.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you certain he did not pass then?
</p>
<p>A. I am perfectly satisfied that he was not
</p>
<p>in the front part of the house that night.
</p>
<p>Q. Did jou see him that night at all ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to my recollection.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him wear a mous-
</p>
<p>tache ?
</p>
<p>A, No, sir, not as I can recollect of.
</p>
<p>James P. Ferguson,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you reside in "Washington city?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. "What business are you engaged in ?
</p>
<p>A. The restaurant business.
</p>
<p>Q. "Where?
</p>
<p>knife. I could see the knife gleam, and that
</p>
<p>moment he was over the box. The Presi-
</p>
<p>dent sat in the left-hand corner of the box,
</p>
<p>and Miss Harris in the right-hand corner.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln sat to the right of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, as I am sitting here. Then the gentle-
</p>
<p>man in citizen's clothe?, whom I learned
</p>
<p>afterward was Major Rat hbone, sat back al-
</p>
<p>most in the corner of the box. The Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, at the time he was shot, was sitting in
</p>
<p>this position ; he was leaning his hand on
</p>
<p>the rail, and was looking down at a person
</p>
<p>in the orchestra, not looking on the stage.
</p>
<p>He had the flag that decorated the box pulled
</p>
<p>around, and was looking between the post
</p>
<p>and the flag. As the person lit on the stage,
</p>
<p>just as he jumped over, I saw it was Booth.
</p>
<p>I saw the flash of the pistol back right in the
</p>
<p>box. As he struck on the stage, he rose and
</p>
<p>exclaimed, "Sic semper tyranjus," and ran
</p>
<p>right directly across the stage to the oppo-
</p>
<p>site door, where the actors come in. I did
</p>
<p>not see anything more of him that evening.
</p>
<p>I got out as quick as T could. I had a little
</p>
<p>girl with me, who lived on E street. As I
</p>
<p>understood General Grant was to be at the
</p>
<p>theatre that night, I took her with me to see
</p>
<p>him. I got her home as quick as I could,
</p>
<p>and then ran down Ninth street to D, and
</p>
<p>through P to the police station, went up
</p>
<p>stairs, and told the Superiutendent of Police,
</p>
<p>Mr. Webb. I then ran up Tenth street to
</p>
<p>the house where the President was. Some
</p>
<p>one told me that General Augur was up
</p>
<p>there, or Colonel Wells. Colonel Wells was

</p>
<p>standing out on the step of Mr. Peterson's
</p>
<p>house. I told him I had seen it all, and knew
</p>
<p>the man that jumped out of the box. He told
</p>
<p>the guard to pass me through, and I went in
</p>
<p>and stated it to him. I then went over the
</p>
<p>stieet and went to bed. In the morning,
</p>
<p>when I got up, I saw Mr. Gilford, and he
</p>
<p>said to me, "You made a hell of a statement
</p>
<p>about what you saw last night. How could
</p>
<p>you Se the flash of the pistol when the ball
</p>
<p>was shot through the door?" I said to him,
</p>
<p>'Mr. Gilford, that pistol never exploded in
</p>
<p>any place but in the box ; I saw the flash."
</p>
<p>Said he, " Oh, hell, the ball was shot through
</p>
<p>the door, and how could you see it?" I
</p>
<p>studied about it all day. On Sunday morn-
</p>
<p>ing. Miss Harris came down, and her father.
</p>
<p>Senator Harris, and Judge Olin and Judge
</p>
<p>Carter, and I went into the theatre with
</p>
<p>them. We had a great deal of difficulty in
</p>
<p>getting the theatre open. Maddox and Gif-
</p>
<p>ford were in the theatre, but would not open
</p>
<p>the door. I sent a j'oung man through my
</p>
<p>back way, and he broke a window in, and
</p>
<p>then Maddox came to the front door, opened
</p>
<p>the theatre, and let us in. We got a candle
</p>
<p>and examined this hole, where Mr. Gilford
</p>
<p>said the ball was shot through. It looked
</p>
<p>to me like as if it had been bored by a small
</p>
<p>gimlet, and then cut around the edge with a
</p>
<p>knife ; and in several places it was scratched
</p>
<p>down as if with a knife. This thing had
</p>
<p>bothered me all night on Saturday night,
</p>
<p>and after this examination, I was satisfied
</p>
<p>that I saw the flash of the pistol. Mr. Gif-
</p>
<p>thouorh it was just done. Miss Harris re-
</p>
<p>marked that Diorning, " There is one thing I
</p>
<p>want to examine ; I am satisfied there was a
</p>
<p>bar across the door when I jumped off my
</p>
<p>seat and called for assistance." We went and
</p>
<p>looked, and there was a square hole cut iu
</p>
<p>the wall just big enough to let iu a bar, and
</p>
<p>this ran across to the door. The door stands
</p>
<p>in a kind ot an angle, and thi? bar being
</p>
<p>placed in the wall, th" other end came against
</p>
<p>the door, and you could not open it. That
</p>
<p>had been cut with a penknife, as it looked to
</p>
<p>me. There was a scratch down the wall.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you observe the character of the
</p>
<p>spur at all, or did he move too rapidly for
</p>
<p>that?
</p>
<p>A. I could not observe that. The way I
</p>
<p>noticed the spur was, when I saw the flag
</p>
<p>pulled down I watched to see what it was
</p>
<p>caught to, as he went over the edge of the box.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see him after he disap-
</p>
<p>peared behind the scenes ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I did not see him afterwards.
</p>
<p>He ran right acro?s the stage. I was up in
</p>
<p>the dress-circle and he ran out the side door.
</p>
<p>A young man named Hawk was the only
</p>
<p>one on the stage at the time. As he went
</p>
<p>over he had the knife raised, the handle up
</p>
<p>and the blade down.
</p>
<p>Q. He went out on the opposite corner of
</p>
<p>the sta2;e from the President's box ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; he ran right straight across
</p>
<p>the stage.
</p>

</p>
<p>A. I did not. We could not find it. There
</p>
<p>was no bar there on Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know Edward Spangler, the
</p>
<p>prisoner at the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. I know Mr. Spangler.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him that niglit?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect seeing him that night
</p>
<p>at all. I was in the theatre all the night. I
</p>
<p>went in, I think, at about twenty minutes to
</p>
<p>eight o'clock. I wanted to be there before
</p>
<p>the party came there, and I went in early. I
</p>
<p>did not see Mr. Spangler that night at all,
</p>
<p>that I recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know him well?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; he worked at the theatre,
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him wear a mous-
</p>
<p>tache ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I ever did. I do not
</p>
<p>recollect ever seeing hini wear a moustache.
</p>
<p>He never wore any moustache, I think, since
</p>
<p>I have been there.

<p>William Withers, Jr.
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>By the JtJDGE Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you belong to the orchestra of Ford's
</p>
<p>Theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you there on the night of the as-
</p>
<p>sassiaatio i of the President?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see J, Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you saw of him.
</p>
<p>A. I had some business on the stage with
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know which side was his
</p>
<p>position?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the passage
</p>
<p>through which Booth passed out of the door
</p>
<p>is obstructed generally?
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes there are a great many
</p>
<p>scenes there so that you cannot pass. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing some of the pieces while Air. Forrest was
</p>
<p>there, there were a great ma^i\' scenes put up
</p>
<p>against the wall, and generally there are a
</p>
<p>lot of tools lying close by this door, but oji
</p>
<p>that night everything seemed to be clear. I
</p>
<p>met nobody tliere that night that I met John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there a necessity for mnnv shift-
</p>
<p>ings of the scenes in the play that night?
</p>
<p>A. There was a very long wait in that
</p>
<p>scene. 1 think it was the time Asa Trench-
</p>
<p>ard was to meet ilarj- Meredith and propose
</p>
<p>to her. After he does that they both go otF
</p>
<p>and the scene changes there. I do not think
</p>
<p>it wanted many minutes until the scene
</p>
<p>changed.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a time in the scene, and such a
</p>
<p>scene, where the stage and that pasuage-way
</p>
<p>would probablj', in the ordinary course of
</p>
<p>things, have been obstructed?
</p>
<p>A. A little, by some of the scene-shifters.
</p>
<p>They might have been there, and the actors ;
</p>
<p>some of them had to go on the next scene,
</p>
<p>which required their presence.
</p>
<p>Q. Where is the actor's room?
</p>
<p>A. The actor's room is to the right, facing
</p>
<p>the audience as you go up the stairs; the

</p>
<p>green room is about two yards from the
</p>
<p>stage ; there is a wall partition that separated
</p>
<p>the stage and the green-room, and then there
</p>
<p>is the stars' room, on the first floor, end up
</p>
<p>stairs are the dressing-rooms for the act-
</p>
<p>ors.
</p>
<p>Q. The green-room is the p'ace where the
</p>
<p>actors wait before going on the stags?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; they are called from this
</p>
<p>room to prepare to go on the stage about five
</p>
<p>minutes or sometimes two minutes before
</p>
<p>they go on the stage, and they sit down there
</p>
<p>and wait for the call-boy to call them and
</p>
<p>go on in the respective scenes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth pass between the scenes and
</p>
<p>the green room?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How wide is that passage between the
</p>
<p>scenes and the green room?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge it to be about as wide
</p>
<p>as this railing, (about four feet.) The door
</p>
<p>faces right on the stage. There is another
</p>
<p>scene that comes to separate it, but this
</p>
<p>leaves the door from the scene. You look
</p>
<p>from the scenes to the dressing-room. Here
</p>
<p>is a scene and there also ; and from here there
</p>
<p>is a prompter's desk, and this scene is open
</p>
<p>from the door that leads into the dressing- j
</p>
<p>room. Then there is an open space that leads
</p>
<p>right on to the stage, and nothing to obstruct
</p>
<p>the passage. |
</p>
<p>Q. I mean from the door out of which he
</p>
<p>passed ?
</p>
<p>A. It is not so large as the dressing-room
</p>
<p>door there, and there are some scenes there
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>A. I did not ?ee one.
</p>
<p>Q. Wns the door open ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think it was, because, as I
</p>
<p>turned around when I heard the report of the
</p>
<p>pistol  I was astonished that a pistol should
</p>
<p>be fired off in that piece  I looked at the
</p>
<p>door, because the door was only a yard from
</p>
<p>ine.
</p>
<p>Q. There was nothing to obstruct his pas-
</p>
<p>sage out?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, nothing.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not that an unusual state of
</p>
<p>things?
</p>
<p>A. It seemed strange to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not unusual ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q, Was there any check at the door, or
</p>
<p>was it open before?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. When he gave me the blow
</p>
<p>that knocked me down in the scene, and
</p>
<p>when I came to and got a side view of him,
</p>
<p>it seemed to me that he made one plunge at
</p>
<p>the door, and as soon as he made the plunge
</p>
<p>he was out.
</p>
<p>Q. The door opens out ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it opens inward on the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it your impression that the door
</p>
<p>was opened for him, or did he open it him-
</p>
<p>self? O
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your impression ?
</p>
<p>'"' A. It seems to me I tried it myself the day
</p>
<p>I went to rehearsal, to get a hold of the door,
</p>
<p>because it surprised me that he made a jump

</p>
<p>and went out of the door.
</p>
<p>Q. There was no delay, but he passed right
</p>
<p>out?
</p>
<p>A. There was no delay; from the jump he
</p>
<p>made he went right out.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it your impression that some one
</p>
<p>assisted him to get out by opening the door?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say. I tried the door to
</p>
<p>gee if the knob would come that way. I
</p>
<p>did not see anybody, only him, go out.
</p>
<p>By the Jddgb Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do the scenes stand at this moment just
</p>
<p>as they were left at that time, or have they
</p>
<p>been changed?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know.
</p>
<p>By the Cocut :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say there was no way for any
</p>
<p>person getting out from tlie rear of the the-
</p>
<p>atre except out of the front entrance?
</p>
<p>A. You have to come to the front, without
</p>
<p>you go to the alley and come in the front.
</p>

<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being

<p>Q. Do you live in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What connection have you had with

</p>
<p>dent was assassinated?
</p>
<p>A. I was up on the flies, to wind up the
</p>
<p>curtain.
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Spangler was not, but there was a
</p>
<p>yoiinoj man hired by Mr. Booth. I suppose
</p>
<p>Mr. Booth thought this young man might
</p>
<p>not do right by his horses, and he got Mr.
</p>
<p>Spangler to see that it should be done right
</p>
<p>when he was not there.
</p>
<p>Q. What position had Mr. Spangler in the
</p>
<p>theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Spangler was one of the stage man-
</p>
<p>agers, one that shoved the scenes at night and
</p>
<p>worked on the stage all day.
</p>
<p>Q. On what side of the stage was his usual
</p>
<p>position in the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. On the back part of the stage, there was
</p>
<p>his particular place.
</p>
<p>Q. On which side ?
</p>
<p>A. On the right-hand side of the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. As you face it from the audience?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. That was the side of the President's
</p>
<p>box, was it, or vvas it not ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; the President's box was on the
</p>
<p>left-hand side.
</p>
<p>Q. The left-hand side looking out from the
</p>
<p>stage ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Spangler's place, you say, was on
</p>
<p>the other side?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, next to the back door leading out
</p>
<p>to the alley.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was your position?
</p>
<p>A. Right on the flies, where we wind the
</p>
<p>curtain up, on the third story.

</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes; Mr. Spangler was there on the
</p>
<p>stage attending to his business, as usual.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you see him ?
</p>
<p>A. In the early part of the night, I cannot
</p>
<p>tell exactly when ; I never inquired to know
</p>
<p>the particular time. We had no time up
</p>
<p>there where we were. Only two men worked
</p>
<p>up there.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you see him before the
</p>
<p>President was shot?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see Mr. Spangler at all before
</p>
<p>the President was shot. I myself was not
</p>
<p>thinking about anything like that going on.
</p>
<p>I was busy looking at the performance until
</p>
<p>I heard the report of a pistol.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not see Mr. Spangler during
</p>
<p>the play that night?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, he was there ; he was on the
</p>
<p>stage during the play ; he was obliged to be
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him in the first act?
</p>
<p>A. Yes; he was there in the first act; I
</p>
<p>saw him then.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him in the second act ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember seeing him in the
</p>
<p>second act.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you down off the flies ?
</p>
<p>A. I was not off the flies. 1 could see him
</p>
<p>very well from the flies on the opposite side
</p>
<p>of the stage, next to the side where the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident was sitting in his box. I could see
</p>
<p>from my side over to that side of the
</p>
<p>stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you on the side that the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's box was on?
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q- Were you there on the night of the
</p>
<p>assassination of the President?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see J. Wilkes Booth there ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him when he came there.
</p>
<p>Q. What hour did he come? Tell us all
</p>
<p>you saw.
</p>
<p>A. He came there, I think, between nine
</p>
<p>and ten o'clock, and he brought a horse from
</p>
<p>the stable and came to the back door and
</p>
<p>called "Ned Spangler" three times out of the
</p>
<p>theatre. Ned Spangler went a cross the stage
</p>
<p>to him. After that I did not see what became of
</p>
<p>Booth, and never notictdhim any more until
</p>
<p>I heard a pistol go off. I then went up in
</p>
<p>sight of the President's bo.x. The man up
</p>
<p>with me said some one had shot the President.
</p>
<p>The President had then gone out of sight. I
</p>
<p>could not see him. I went in a minute or
</p>
<p>two to Ihe window and I heard the sound of
</p>
<p>horses' feet going out of the alley.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see anybody holding the horse
</p>
<p>out there?
</p>
<p>A. I saw the boy holding the horse there;
</p>
<p>from the time I saw him he held him fifteen
</p>
<p>minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that after he called for Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You mean Spangler, he prisoner here?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know what was said between
</p>
<p>them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; T do not know anything about

</p>
<p>what was said between them. I did not un-
</p>
<p>derstand a word. I only haard him called
</p>
<p>"Ned."
</p>
<p>Q. You say he came up to the door with
</p>
<p>his horse between nine and ten o'clock. Do
</p>
<p>you know at what hour he put his horse in
</p>
<p>the little stable back of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. He had put his horse in the stable when
</p>
<p>I came over there. He and Ned Spangler and
</p>
<p>Jim Maddox came up from the stable in
</p>
<p>the evening, I think, about three o'clock.
</p>
<p>I judge it was about that time. I did not
</p>
<p>notice the time particularly. 'It was the time
</p>
<p>he came right through the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. How far is the little stable in which he
</p>
<p>kept the horse from the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Not more than fifty yards, if that.
</p>
<p>Cross examined by Mr. Ewing.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the play going on when Booth rode
</p>
<p>up and called for Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. They had just closed a scene and were
</p>
<p>getting ready to take off that scene at the time
</p>
<p>he called for Spangler. Spangler was at the
</p>
<p>second groove then, and pushed a scene across.
</p>
<p>Booth called him three times.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you then?
</p>
<p>A. Up on the flies, about three and one-
</p>
<p>half stories from the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that in the third act?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was in the third act.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it before the President
</p>
<p>was shot?
</p>
<p>A. The President came in during the first
</p>
<p>act, and I think it was iu the third act he waa
</p>
<p>shot.
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>the stable door. John Peanuts always at-
</p>
<p>tended to the horses. I never saw Spangler
</p>
<p>put any gear on any of theni.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what place on the stage
</p>
<p>Spangler generally occupied?
</p>
<p>A. He worked on the right-band side, the
</p>
<p>side next to E street.
</p>
<p>Q. The side the President's box was on ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; on that side.
</p>
<p>Q. Cuiild you see from where you were up
</p>
<p>in the flies ?
</p>
<p>A. 1 could see right straight down through
</p>
<p>the scenes on that side of the stage, and I
</p>
<p>always saw him work on that side.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he on that side when Booth called
</p>
<p>him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; he was.
</p>
<p>Q. WJiiit was Spangler's business on that
</p>
<p>side? What kept him ou that side ?
</p>
<p>A. He shoved the scenes at night on that
</p>
<p>side.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there another man shoving from
</p>
<p>the other side?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; there was another man op-
</p>
<p>posite to him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler after you saw that
</p>
<p>Peanut John was holding Booth's horse?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw him anymore uulil I came
</p>
<p>down. I came down the stairs afier the
</p>
<p>President was shot, and Spangler was out at
</p>
<p>the door.
</p>
<p>Q. At what door?
</p>
<p>A. At the same door Booth went out, when
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Were there others out there?
</p>
<p>A. Y'es ; there were some more men out
</p>
<p>there; I did not notice who they were, but
</p>
<p>some nioie besides him
</p>
<p>Q. More men of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. That were at the theatre that night ;
</p>
<p>there were some strangers out there then, I
</p>
<p>believe, because every person had got over
</p>
<p>the stage then that wanted to go over.
</p>
<p>Q. How many men were out at the back
</p>
<p>door at that time?
</p>
<p>A. Not more than two or three out of the
</p>
<p>door when I came down, because I came
</p>
<p>down in a very short time after I understood
</p>
<p>what it was, and Spangler came out and I
</p>
<p>asked him who it was that held the horse,
</p>
<p>and he told me " hush," " not to say noth-
</p>
<p>ing," and I did not say any more, though I
</p>
<p>knew who it was, because I saw the boj^
</p>
<p>who was holding the horse. I knew that the
</p>
<p>person who brought the horse there rode him
</p>
<p>away again.
</p>
<p>Q. 'i'ou could not see Spangler all the time
</p>
<p>when he was on the stage, could you, from
</p>
<p>where you were?
</p>
<p>A. When he was working on that side I
</p>
<p>could see him all the while if I looked for
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you look for him that night?
</p>
<p>A. No; I did not notice him particularly
</p>
<p>that night more than usual. I would not
</p>
<p>have noticed him when I did, only I heard
</p>
<p>Booth call him, and I noticed where he was
</p>
<p>when he went to Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. He might have been on that side all
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>A. It was open when I came down stairs.
</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was left open from
</p>
<p>the time he came in and went out or not;
</p>
<p>but it was open when I got down stairs. I
</p>
<p>had to go down three and a-half stories be-
</p>
<p>fore I got down on the stage, and when Igot
</p>
<p>down it was open.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know anybody who probably
</p>
<p>heard your remark to Mr. Spangler and his
</p>
<p>reply to you ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I do not know any person
</p>
<p>that was noticing the words at all. There
</p>
<p>were a good many persons around, but I do
</p>
<p>not know that any of them was noticing the
</p>
<p>words used.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. When Booth called for Ned Spangler the
</p>
<p>first time, did you see where Spangler was ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes ; when I noticed where Spangler
</p>
<p>was, he was right across the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. You say Booth called him three times;
</p>
<p>when he called the tirst time, did you see
</p>
<p>where Spangler was ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see where he was then, be-
</p>
<p>cause I did not notice where he was until
</p>
<p>Booth called him the third time; then I saw
</p>
<p>where he was standing.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did Spangler meet Booth then ?
</p>
<p>A. He went towards the door. After he
</p>
<p>got underneath the flies, I could not see him
</p>
<p>any more.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you lost sight of him as he was
</p>
<p>going to the door?
</p>

</p>
<p>time ?

</p>
<p>when I spoke to him ; he was walking across
</p>
<p>the door, in front of the door, outside the
</p>
<p>door. There was nobody else between him
</p>
<p>and me and the door, because I brushed right
</p>
<p>up to him and asked who was holding the
</p>
<p>horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Right at the door was it lighter dark?
</p>
<p>A. Dark right at that door ; and it was a

<p>crowd came out, and this time this man
</p>
<p>"Ned" came but of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Which of those men in the dock is it?
</p>
<p>A. There he sits with dark shirt and dark
</p>
<p>coat on, [pointing to the accused, Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler.]
</p>
<p>Q. Spangler, you mean?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, Ned Spangler ; and said I to
</p>
<p>him, "Mr. Ned, you know that man Booth
</p>
<p>called you?" Said he, "No, I know nothing
</p>
<p>about it," and then he went down the alley.

<p>Q. Was that all that occurred between you
</p>
<p>and him?
</p>
<p>A. That was all that was said between me
</p>
<p>and him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. How far is your house from the back
</p>
<p>door of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. My front door fronts to the back of the
</p>
<p>theatre. It comes out into the open alley,
</p>
<p>which leads up to the door. There is another
</p>
<p>house between mine and the theatre. The
</p>
<p>two houses are adjoining, and my house
</p>
<p>stands as far from the door of the theatre as
</p>
<p>from here to the post. [About twenty-two
</p>
<p>feet.] I think it would allow that space for
</p>
<p>the two houses.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see where Spangler went after
</p>
<p>he called Maddox?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I did not see where Spangler
</p>
<p>went after he called Maddox.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he go off?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember whether he went off
</p>
<p>or not. I did not see him any more.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him go in to call Maddox ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; he turned from the door to
</p>
<p>call Maddox.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear him call him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I did not hear him call Maddox.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler come out again ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember whether he came
</p>
<p>out or not ; I do not think I did see him
</p>
<p>come out.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Mart Jane Anderson,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>theatre again. This man that carried the
</p>
<p>horse up went in the door. too. The horse
</p>
<p>stood out there a considerable while. It kept
</p>
<p>up a great deal of stamping on the stones,
</p>
<p>and I said, "I wonder what is the matter
</p>
<p>with that horse;" it kept stamping so. After
</p>
<p>a while I saw this person have a hold of the
</p>
<p>horse, and he kept the horse walking back-
</p>
<p>wards and forwards. I suppose the horse
</p>
<p>was there completely an hour and a half alto- '
</p>
<p>gether ; then I saw the door open ; I did not
</p>
<p>see any person passing backwards and for-
</p>
<p>wards, and in about ten minutes after that I
</p>
<p>saw this man [Booth] come out of the door
</p>
<p>with something in his hand glittering. I did
</p>
<p>not know what it was; but still I thought
</p>
<p>some person ran out of the theatre and
</p>
<p>jumped on the horse. He had come out of
</p>
<p>the theatre door so quick, that it seemed like
</p>
<p>as if he but touched that horse, and it was
</p>
<p>gone like a flash of lightning. I thought to
</p>
<p>myself " that horse mast surely have run oflF
</p>
<p>with that eentleman." Presently I saw a
</p>
<p>rush out of that door, and heard the people
</p>
<p>saying, '-Which way did he go?" and
</p>
<p>""which way did he go?" and still 1 did not
</p>
<p>know what was the matter. I asked a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman what was the matter, and he said the
</p>
<p>President was shot. "Why,'" said I, ' who
</p>
<p>shot him?'' Said he, " That man who went
</p>
<p>out on the horse ; did you see him?" I said
</p>
<p>I saw him when he first came out. That was
</p>
<p>the last time I saw him to know him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the prisoner Spangler at

</p>
<p>that time?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I saw Mr. Spangler after
</p>
<p>that. After that I came down stairs, and was
</p>
<p>at the door talking. I went up to the thea-
</p>
<p>tre door, and 1 saw Mr. Spangler when be
</p>
<p>came out of the door. Some one said, "Did
</p>
<p>you see that man?" I said to Mr. Spangler,
</p>
<p>"Mr. Spangler, that gentleman called you."
</p>
<p>Said he, " No, he did not." Said I. " Yes,
</p>
<p>he did ; he called you." He said, "No, he
</p>
<p>did not ; he did not call me." I said, "He
</p>
<p>did call you," and T kept on saying so. With
</p>
<p>that, he walked down toward the alley, and
</p>
<p>1 did not see him any more until Sunday ;
</p>
<p>but I did not say anything to him at all then.
</p>
<p>I had no other conversation with him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewisg :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know Mr. Maddox ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of a looking man is he?
</p>
<p>A. He has a kind of a reddish skin, and
</p>
<p>sometimes a kind of palish and light hair.
</p>
<p>Q. How old a man is he?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose he is about 25 or 2C.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen him often?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I have seen him very often.
</p>
<p>I live close by there. I used to work for him
</p>
<p>right smart. I used to wash some pieces for
</p>
<p>him, and used to go there to the door and
</p>
<p>bring them. I know him very well by sight.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it he who held this horse during
</p>
<p>all the time it was in the alley there?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; it did not seem like as if be
</p>
<p>held it all the time ; bnt he took hold of the
</p>
<p>horse, and it seemed as if he had him a little
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>Q. Did that man look like Mr. iladdox?
</p>
<p>A. He looked very much like Mr. Maddox
</p>
<p>to me. I know Mr. Maddox. He wears a
</p>
<p>light coat, aud this maa seemed as if he had
</p>
<p>a light coat on. It was pretty dark there
</p>
<p>that ni^rht; I could not see distinctly from
</p>
<p>my window, but the coat he had on seemed
</p>
<p>as if it was light.
</p>
<p>Q. How far was he from you when you say
</p>
<p>you thought it was Mr. Maddox?
</p>
<p>A. He was right near the door.
</p>
<p>Q. How far from where you were?
</p>
<p>A. About as far as from here to that win-
</p>
<p>dow, or a little further, fabout fifteen
</p>
<p>feet.]
</p>
<p>Q. Whereabouts was the horse just at the
</p>
<p>time when Booth ran out the door?
</p>
<p>A. Standing right at the door.
</p>
<p>Q. And this man with the light coat on
</p>
<p>was standing right by him ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say whether he was standing
</p>
<p>by him, because I was looking at the man
</p>
<p>wlien he rushed out the door so, and every-
</p>
<p>thing was in such a twinkling of an eye that
</p>
<p>I could not say distinctly it was the man with
</p>
<p>the light coat on; but I know there was a
</p>
<p>man holding the horse all the time as far as
</p>
<p>I could see.
</p>
<p>Q. It was not Mr. Spangler that was hold-
</p>
<p>ing him?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. It seems io me it was
</p>
<p>between all three of them. Ihej all three
</p>
<p>seemed to be out there with the horse, &ppa-
</p>
<p>rently. I knew Mr. Ned came out to the

<p>door, and then Mr. Maddox came out, and
</p>
<p>then it seemed as if iMr. Ned came out again.
</p>
<p>Q. But you are not certain that be did
</p>
<p>oome out again?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I am not very certain of that
</p>
<p>but I know there were three men in it alto-
</p>
<p>gether.
</p>
<p>Q. That is, three men connected with it in
</p>
<p>some way ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; three men connected with it
</p>
<p>in some way.
</p>
<p>Q. But you cannot say that you saw Mr.
</p>
<p>Spangler, except when he came out of the
</p>
<p>door and Booth told him to call Maddox,
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I cannot say for certain; but
</p>
<p>I know one of the men Had on a light coat.
</p>
<p>Q. That was the one that was holding the
</p>
<p>horse ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Major Henry R. Rathbone,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, beino-
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified'as follows :
</p>
<p>By the Judgk Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or
</p>
<p>not you were in the box of the President on
</p>
<p>the night of his assassination at Ford's The-
</p>
<p>atre?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. State all the circumstances that came
</p>
<p>under your observation in connection with
</p>
<p>that crime.
</p>
<p>A. On the evening of the 14th of April
</p>
<p>last, at about twenty minutes past eight
</p>
<p>o'clock, I, in company with Miss Plarris, Teft
</p>
<p>my residence at the corner of Fifteenth and
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>to the box, and found the surpeons
</p>
<p>examining the President's person. They
</p>
<p>had not yet discovered the wound. As
</p>
<p>Boon as it was discovered, it was determined
</p>
<p>to remove him from tlie theatre. He was
</p>
<p>carried out, and I then proceeded to assist
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln, who was intensely excited, to
</p>
<p>leave the theatre. On reaching the head of
</p>
<p>the stairs I requested Major Potter to aid me
</p>
<p>in assisting Mrs. Lincoln across the street to
</p>
<p>the house where the President was being con-
</p>
<p>vey ed. The wound which I had received had
</p>
<p>been bleeding very profusely, and on reach-
</p>
<p>ing the house, feeling very faint from the loss
</p>
<p>of blood, I seated myself in the hall, and
</p>
<p>soon after fainted awaj', and was laid upon
</p>
<p>the floor. Upon the 'return of consciousness
</p>
<p>I was taken to my residence. In a review of
</p>
<p>the transactions, it is my confident belief
</p>
<p>that the time which elapsed between the dis-
</p>
<p>charge of the pistol and the time when the
</p>
<p>assassin leaped from the box did not exceed
</p>
<p>30 seconds. Neither Mrs. Lincoln nor Miss
</p>
<p>Harris had left their seats.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not know Booth yourself, did
</p>
<p>you?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize him
</p>
<p>from a photograph ?
</p>
<p>A. I should be unable to do so as being the
</p>
<p>man in that box. I myself have seen him on
</p>
<p>the stage some time since.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What distance was the assassin from the

</p>
<p>President when you first saw him after hear-
</p>
<p>ing the report?
</p>
<p>A. The distance from the door to where
</p>
<p>the President was sitting, to the best of my
</p>
<p>recollection, was about four or five feet, and
</p>
<p>this man was standing between the door and
</p>
<p>the President.
</p>
<p>By the Jcdge Advocatk :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at that knife [exhibiting
</p>
<p>a knife to the witness] and say it it appears
</p>
<p>to you to be such a one as he used? I be-
</p>
<p>lieve the blood is still on the blade.
</p>
<p>A. I think this knife might have made a
</p>
<p>wound similar to the one I received. I could
</p>
<p>not recognize the knife. I merely saw the
</p>
<p>gleam .
</p>
<p>[The knife was offered in evidence without
</p>
<p>objection, and is marked Exhibit No. 28.]
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice how the blade was held
</p>
<p>in the hand of the assassin when he held it?
</p>
<p>A. The blade was held in a horizontal po-
</p>
<p>sition, 1 should think, and the nature of the
</p>
<p>wound would indicate it. It came with a
</p>
<p>Bweeping blow down from above.

</p>
<p>sassirstioD.
</p>
<p>Q- Did he come to your home and ask for
</p>
<p>a room at that hour ?
</p>
<p>A. I had just come in the house myself
</p>
<p>and went to my room. Abowt fixe minutes
</p>
<p>afterwards a serrant came up with a fire dol-
</p>
<p>lar bill and told me,  there is a man coiBe
</p>
<p>in with .\tzerodt who wants lodsing-s and
</p>
<p>wants to pay for it." So I went down and
</p>
<p>gave the man his change. I had an nneasi
</p>
<p>ness about the thing myself  thought there
</p>
<p>was something wrong. [
</p>
<p>Q. Did they take a room together? |
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Atzerodt asked for his old
</p>
<p>room, and I told him it was occupied. I told
</p>
<p>him he would have to go with this gentle-
</p>
<p>man. So I gave the man his change  this
</p>
<p>Thomas  and told the serrant to show him
</p>
<p>to his room, and Atzerodt was going to fol-
</p>
<p>low him. Said I, " Atrerodt you have not

</p>
<p>registered." Said he.  Do tou want my;
</p>
<p>name?" Said I, "Certainly." He hesitated
</p>
<p>some, but stepped back and registered, and
</p>
<p>went to his room. That was the last I saw
</p>
<p>of him. j
</p>
<p>Q. Will you descril>e the appearance of,
</p>
<p>that man who was with him ?
</p>
<p>A. He was a man about fire feet seven or I
</p>
<p>eight inches high, and his weiiiht was about
</p>
<p>one hundred and forty pounds, I should j
</p>
<p>judee.
</p>
<p>Q. How was he dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. Poorly dressf d, and in dark. His pants i
</p>
<p>were worn throusrh at the back near the
</p>
<p>heels. I took noiice of that as he walked out
</p>
<p>of the door to go to his room. He was quite
</p>
<p>dark complexioned and very much weather-
</p>
<p>beaten. He had dark hair.
</p>
<p>Q. Had he the appearance of a laboring
</p>
<p>man?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; the appearance of a laboring
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you express an opinion as to I
</p>
<p>whether the clothes in which he was dressed
</p>
<p>were such as he would probably ordinsrily
</p>
<p>wear, or were assumed as a disguise ? Have i
</p>
<p>yoii an opinion on that subject ? |
</p>
<p>A. I judged them to be more of a disguise. J
</p>
<p>I think it was a broadcloth coat he had on, j
</p>
<p>verv much worn, though.
</p>
<p>Q. The whole appearance, you say, was
</p>
<p>riiabby?
</p>
<p>A Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What nam? did he sissnme?
</p>
<p>A. Sam. Thomas.
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>There were other parties in it before these
</p>
<p>men went there.
</p>
<p>.Q. Do jou know the prisoner, O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>lin?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not remember to have seen
</p>
<p>him ?
</p>
<p>A. No.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe whether either of these
</p>
<p>parties was armed ?'
</p>
<p>A. I have seen Atzerodthave a revolver.
</p>
<p>Q. On the occasion spuken of?
</p>
<p>A. There are others in the party who said
</p>
<p>he had a knife, but I did not see that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did JOU observe whether the other man,
</p>
<p>Thomas, as he called himself, was armed ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. You say be stared at you very much ;
</p>
<p>did he make any remark to you ?
</p>
<p>A. All he said to me was that he was a
</p>
<p>poor writer.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he enter his name himself?
</p>
<p>A, I did not see that, but I judge that his
</p>
<p>name was entered when I came into the room.
</p>
<p>Q. You say Atzerodt was in the habit of
</p>
<p>stopping at your hotel ? Had he, on any
</p>
<p>previous occasion, hesitated to register his
</p>
<p>name when taking rooms there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that he did hesitate on this oc-
</p>
<p>casion?
</p>
<p>A. On this occasion he hesitated some-
</p>
<p>what.
</p>

</p>
<p>armed. When was that?
</p>
<p>A. That must have been in Ifarch, when
</p>
<p>I first saw his revolver. He had just bought
</p>
<p>it, and he came in and made the remark that
</p>
<p>he had just bought it , and I told him I
</p>
<p>wished I had known that he wanted one, for
</p>
<p>I could have sold him one that I had  a new
</p>
<p>one, which I had traded a small one for, and
</p>
<p>I had no use for it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he exhibit the revolver to you?
</p>
<p>A. It was put in my care  handed in to
</p>
<p>the office.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize it
</p>
<p>if you saw it again?
</p>
<p>A. I think I would.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting the revolver identified by
</p>
<p>John Lee as found in a room at the Kirkwood-
</p>
<p>House.] Is that it?
</p>
<p>A. I would not be certain. T do not think
</p>
<p>it is the same one, but it is something simi-
</p>
<p>lar.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you be kind enough to state on
</p>
<p>what day before the 14th of April Atzerodt
</p>
<p>left your house?
</p>
<p>A. It must have been on Wednesday, the
</p>
<p>12th.
</p>
<p>Q. How long had he stayed at your house
</p>
<p>at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. He stayed from the 18th of March until,
</p>
<p>I think, the 2Vth. If I had my register I
</p>
<p>could tell.
</p>
<p>Q. I only want to know about the last vis-
</p>
<p>it before the 14ih of April. How long was
</p>
<p>he at your house then ?

<p>A. Not that I remember, and not that I '
</p>
<p>saw. I have had half a dollar in ray pocket,
</p>
<p>and I might have had that out, but I do not
</p>
<p>remember having it out.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not remember saying that you
</p>
<p>had bought some gold that morning?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you also been drinking?
</p>
<p>A I had taken a drink; I was not in
</p>
<p>liquor.
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand you to say that you
</p>
<p>do not remember saying that you had bought
</p>
<p>gold and silver that morning?
</p>
<p>A. 1 do not remember that I did. When
</p>
<p>Mr. Bailey left my house, he wanted to pay
</p>
<p>his stage fare, and I bought some eight or
</p>
<p>nine 2| gold pieces, and I do not remember
</p>
<p>the exact amount of silver, but some $7, I
</p>
<p>think.
</p>
<p>Q. What brought the conversation to gold
</p>
<p>and silver?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I ever had any con-
</p>
<p>versation about gold and silver. There was
</p>
<p>only the remark of Atzerodt ; there was no
</p>
<p>other conversation about it.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you not before been talking about
</p>
<p>money in some shape?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I had not been talking with
</p>
<p>him at all until I entered the room. He asked
</p>
<p>me to drink.
</p>
<p>Q. Had any one else, to your knowledge,
</p>
<p>been talking with him about money?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>

</p>
<p>Thomas as having come to your house on the
</p>
<p>morning of this Saturday, between two and
</p>
<p>three o'clock, in comp.iny with Atzerodt.
</p>
<p>Did they seem to be intimate?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take them to be previously ac-
</p>
<p>quainted?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell in regard to that. They
</p>
<p>came to my house.
</p>
<p>Q. You can tell what you took them to
</p>
<p>be. Did you take them to be acquaintances
</p>
<p>or strangers ?
</p>
<p>A. I thought they were in company by the
</p>
<p>way they came there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the}' look as though they bad
</p>
<p>known one another previously, or bad met
</p>
<p>one another on the street, and just happened
</p>
<p>to come to your house together ?
</p>
<p>A. I judged that they were acquainted.
</p>
<p>Q. You say this man exhibited signs of
</p>
<p>disguise ? What were they ?
</p>
<p>A. He had on broadcloth clothing. It
</p>
<p>did not look like working clothing, and it
</p>
<p>was well worn  not laboring man's cloth-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>Q. His clothing was well worn and broad-
</p>
<p>cloth, and that made you think he was in
</p>
<p>disguise?
</p>
<p>A . Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You have also mentioned that Atzerodt
</p>
<p>hesitated to register his name? In what
</p>
<p>shape did he hesitate?
</p>
<p>A. "Well," said he, "do you wish my
</p>
<p>name?" I said, "Certiinly." He stood
</p>
<p>back, and then he walked forward and
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>Q. Was the beard on the side of the face
</p>
<p>close?
</p>
<p>A. His beard came front, and was cut down
</p>
<p>from the moustache up, but it was either that
</p>
<p>way or whisliers all around. I knew he had
</p>
<p>whiskers in front.
</p>
<p>Q. What sort of a hat did he wear?
</p>
<p>A. A dark slouch bat.
</p>
<p>Q. Worn?
</p>
<p>A. Yes. sir.
</p>
<p>By the JuDCrE Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do 1 understand you to say that you
</p>
<p>are certain you have not seen the prisoner
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin at your house?
</p>
<p>A. I am. I do not know the man.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster:
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to say that Thom-
</p>
<p>as came in company with Atzerodt?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see them come in. When I
</p>
<p>first saw them Atzerodt was lying on the set-
</p>
<p>tee and Thomas standing at the counter at
</p>
<p>the register.
</p>
<p>Q. What made you think they belonged
</p>
<p>together?
</p>
<p>A. The servant told me they came in to-
</p>
<p>gether.
</p>
<p>Q. That is the only ground of your believ-
</p>
<p>ing they were intimate?
</p>
<p>A. That is all I bad.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state, if you please, the direct
</p>
<p>color of the hair and beard of Thomas ?
</p>
<p>A. As near as I can tell, his hair was black,
</p>
<p>black eye-brows, and black whiskers. He
</p>
<p>bad a moustache cut off from sides rather

<p>close, and beard in front.
</p>
<p>Q. Did either the hair or moustache appear
</p>
<p>to be dyed ?
</p>
<p>A. Xo, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the color ?
</p>
<p>A. Black.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Atzerodt refuse or object to
</p>
<p>this stranger going into his room? ,
</p>
<p>A. Xo, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ask that he should come in ?
</p>
<p>A. Xo, sir. I
</p>
<p>Q. He simply acceded to it when you told '
</p>
<p>him that there was no other room ? i
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I told him he would have to '
</p>
<p>room with that man.
</p>
<p>Q. You forced them together, in short ?
</p>
<p>A. I told him he would have to. That was
</p>
<p>my work. I would not force him ; he could I
</p>
<p>have taken th^t or lelt the house ; that was
</p>
<p>the best'I could do for him. I
</p>
<p>By the Col-rt : '
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether they got up at .
</p>
<p>the same time in the morning ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they occupy the same bed ?
</p>
<p>A. Xo.
</p>
<p>Q. You said that the last time Atzerodt
</p>
<p>left your house before the assassination was
</p>
<p>on Wednesday?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. He told me, going away,
</p>
<p>" Greenawalt, I owe you a couple of days"
</p>
<p>board ; will it make any difference to you
</p>
<p>whether I pay for it now or when I come
</p>
<p>back? I said, "No.'' Then he remarked,
</p>
<p>"It will be more convenient for me to pay
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>passa3e-way ia somewhat dark, and I pro-
</p>
<p>cured a lieht and examined very carefully the
</p>
<p>hole bored through the door. I discovered
</p>
<p>at once that the hole was made by some small
</p>
<p>instrument in the first place, and was. as I
</p>
<p>supposed, cut out then by a sharp instrument
</p>
<p>like a penknife ; and you can see, by placing
</p>
<p>a light near the door  if I am not very much
</p>
<p>mistaken, I thought I saw  marks of a sharp
</p>
<p>cutting knife, cleaning out every obstacle to
</p>
<p>looking through that hole in the door. I then
</p>
<p>discovered, also, that the clasp that fastens
</p>
<p>thebolt of the first door  this would be a dou-
</p>
<p>ble box on some occasions, there is a movable
</p>
<p>partition fitted to it  on the clasp that re-
</p>
<p>ceives the lock of that door, the upper screw
</p>
<p>holding the clasp had been loosened in such
</p>
<p>a way that when the door was locked, by
</p>
<p>putting my forefinger against the door and
</p>
<p>pushing it, I could push the door open.
</p>
<p>I seated myself as near as I could ascertain
</p>
<p>the position of the chair in which the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent sat that evening ; for I procured, to ac-
</p>
<p>company me. Miss Harris, who I understood
</p>
<p>was in the box on that occasion, and she lo-
</p>
<p>cated the chair as nearly as she recollected it
</p>
<p>to have been placed on the evening; and in
</p>
<p>seating myself in the chair, closing that door,
</p>
<p>and letting a person place his eye very near
</p>
<p>that hole, close to the door, the ranare would
</p>
<p>be about from one to the other, striking my
</p>
<p>head about midway from the base to the
</p>
<p>crown.
</p>
<p>I directed my attention principally at that

</p>
<p>early stage of the investigation to ascertain-
</p>
<p>ing more particularly the precise period of
</p>
<p>the occurrence, as there was some uncertain-
</p>
<p>ty at that time whether the attack upon Mr.
</p>
<p>Seward's family and the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President was the result of the act of some
</p>
<p>one person or more persons, and I directed
</p>
<p>my attention in the first place more particu-
</p>
<p>larly to ascertaining the precipe period of
</p>
<p>time as nearly as I could when this occurred.
</p>
<p>I continued to make some examinations.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine the condition of the
</p>
<p>locks on the doors?
</p>
<p>A. I did. I examined the condition of the
</p>
<p>locks. The lock played readily.
</p>
<p>Q. A hasp or catch?
</p>
<p>A. As I before observed, the catch of one
</p>
<p>door, the first door that would enter into the
</p>
<p>first box as you passed into the box from this
</p>
<p>alley-way, the upper screw holding the hasp
</p>
<p>was loosened in such a way that it could be 1
</p>
<p>pressed upon with the finger when the door '
</p>
<p>was locked, and the hasp would fall back. I .
</p>
<p>also examined to see if I could discover the '
</p>
<p>chips that must have been made by boring i
</p>
<p>and cutting out this small hole, hat they had
</p>
<p>apparently been removed. I discovered noth- j
</p>
<p>ing of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the bar, or had it been
</p>
<p>lost? I
</p>
<p>A. It had been remove! by some one. You ]
</p>
<p>could see the indentation upon the door, in '
</p>
<p>the panel of the door, where some brace
</p>
<p>might have been made from the wall to the
</p>
<p>door. That indentation there is perceptible,
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>A. The bar was securely fastened in the
</p>
<p>wall, and appeared to be resting against the
</p>
<p>moulding of the door. I think it could not
</p>
<p>have been jostled out by any pushing from
</p>
<p>the outside.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice particularly the chair in
</p>
<p>which the President sat? What was its
</p>
<p>character?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing, except that it was a large,
</p>
<p>eas}' chair, covered with damask cloth.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether it had rock-
</p>
<p>ers or not?
</p>
<p>A. My impression was that it had ; lam
</p>
<p>not sure.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the bar the door was closed
</p>
<p>with?
</p>
<p>A. I am not able to say.
</p>
<p>Q Was it similar to that?
</p>
<p>A. My impression was, that it was a differ-
</p>
<p>ent piece of wood.

<p>Isaac Jaquette,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a bar to the witness.] 
</p>
<p>Will you please state to the Court v\ hether
</p>
<p>or not you found that bar in Ford's Theatre,
</p>
<p>and under what circumstances, and where?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Soon after the President was
</p>
<p>carried out, I went to the bo.x with several
</p>
<p>others, and this bar was lying inside of the
</p>
<p>first door going into the box  lying on the
</p>
<p>floor. 1 picked it up. I stayed around there

<p>some time, and then carried it out.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take it home with you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. There has been a piece sawed off, has
</p>
<p>there not?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. There was an officer stop-
</p>
<p>ping at the same boarding-house where I
</p>
<p>was, and he wanted a piece of it. I sawed
</p>
<p>a piece off", but he concluded not to take it
</p>
<p>afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. These spots upon it are blood?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they fresh at the time?
</p>
<p>A. They looked fresh at the time.
</p>
<p>[The bar was offered in evidence without
</p>
<p>objection.]

</p>
<p>been working at Ford's Theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I have worked at Mr. Ford's
</p>
<p>Theatre for two years.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you there on the evening of the
</p>
<p>day on the night of which the President was
</p>
<p>assassinated?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the persons engaged in de-
</p>
<p>corating the President's box that after-
</p>
<p>noon?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Harry Ford and another gentle-
</p>
<p>man, I do not know his name exactly, were
</p>
<p>up there fixing up the box. Mr. Han-y Ford
</p>
<p>told me to go up to his bed-room and get a
</p>
<p>rocking-chair out and bring it down and put
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>Q. You say he bad no "other calling
</p>
<p>away." You mean that was all the business
</p>
<p>he was engaged in ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; that was his business.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether he might not
</p>
<p>have had something to call him away from
</p>
<p>the theatre just at that time, do you ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was this other gentleman that was
</p>
<p>in the box with Jlr. Harry Ford?
</p>
<p>A. I thitik his name is Mr. Buckingham;
</p>
<p>I may be mistaken.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he employed about the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. He stood at the doors at night to take
</p>
<p>the tickets when the people came in ; he was
</p>
<p>doorkeeper in front of the house.
</p>
<p>Q. You think it was Mr. Buckingham that
</p>
<p>was there then with Mr. Harry Ford?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was Mr. Buckingham that
</p>
<p>was helping Mr. Harry Ford to fix up the
</p>
<p>private box.
</p>
<p>Q. What hour in the afternoon was it?
</p>
<p>A. It was a little after three o'clock, I
</p>
<p>think ; I did not notice the time particularly ;
</p>
<p>it might have been later and it might have
</p>
<p>been sooner.
</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Ford called you to come up to the
</p>
<p>box, did he?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I was doing something some-
</p>
<p>where around the building, and he called me
</p>
<p>and told me to go to his room and bring
</p>
<p>down that large rocking-chair out of his
</p>
<p>slee[)ing room and put it in the private box.
</p>
<p>I did so, according to his order.

</p>
<p>Q. Where were you when he called you?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know exactly where I was;
</p>
<p>whether I was out in the alley, or whether I
</p>
<p>AA^as up on the flies ; but I was somewhere
</p>
<p>about the building, I know, when he called me.
</p>
<p>Q. You were near enough to hear when he
</p>
<p>called?
</p>
<p>A, I had come in from carrying bills; I
</p>
<p>carried the bills out every day so that the
</p>
<p>people could see what was going to be played;
</p>
<p>and I came back that evening and was about
</p>
<p>to take my meal, was going to eat up on the
</p>
<p>flie, when he called me. He called me down,
</p>
<p>and told me to go up to his room and get the
</p>
<p>chair.
</p>
<p>Q. You took your meals up on the flies,
</p>
<p>did you?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I used to take my meals there,
</p>
<p>of course.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you generally take
</p>
<p>that meal ?
</p>
<p>A. I generally took it whenever I could.
</p>
<p>When 1 came in the morning I would take
</p>
<p>out the bills, and that would keep me some-
</p>
<p>times until three o'clock, and sometimes
</p>
<p>longer ; and whenever I would come back I
</p>
<p>would eat.
</p>
<p>Q. And you were eating when he called
</p>
<p>you?
</p>
<p>A. When he called me to bring the chair,
</p>
<p>I put down my meal, and went and got the
</p>
<p>chair for him, and put it in the private box.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Mr. Spangler as you went
</p>
<p>to the box at all ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I did not see Mr. Spangler. I
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>A. No, sir , I do not. I just brought that
</p>
<p>chair in and set it down. Mr. Ford said,
</p>
<p>that is all I want with vou :" and I went
</p>
<p>down 'immediately .
</p>
<p>Charles H. Rosen,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you know the prisoner
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know him personally.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know bim when you see him?
</p>
<p>A. No ; I was not there at the arrest. I
</p>
<p>went to his house and secured the rope.
</p>
<p>Q. You were not present at his arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you go to his house after the ar-
</p>
<p>rest?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you find there?
</p>
<p>A. We found a carpet-bag at the house
</p>
<p>where he takes his meals, on the corner of
</p>
<p>Seventh and H streets. The man in charge
</p>
<p>of the house handed us a carpet-bag, in whi-h
</p>
<p>we found a piece of rope, which I measured
</p>
<p>afterwards, and found to contain eighty-one
</p>
<p>feet, and the twist was very carefully taken
</p>
<p>out. There was nothing else in the carpet-
</p>
<p>bag except some blank paper and a dirty
</p>
<p>shirt collar. When we inquired for his trunk,
</p>
<p>we were told that he kept it at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that carpet-bag with the rope
</p>
<p>left there? !
</p>
<p>A. It was left at the house where he gen-

</p>
<p>Q.'When?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know. I
</p>
<p>Q. When did you take it?
</p>
<p>A. I took that rope from the house on the
</p>
<p>evening of Monday, the 17th of April since,
</p>
<p>between nine and ten o'clock, in company
</p>
<p>with two military detectives.
</p>
<p>Q. Who were with you?
</p>
<p>A. Two of the Provost Marshal's detec-
</p>
<p>tives.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know their names?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see Spangler himself then ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not. I was to have gone with the
</p>
<p>other officers for the purpose of securing pa-
</p>
<p>pers, but I missed them, and consequently I '
</p>
<p>was not present when he was arrested.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find the carpet-bag open? Had
</p>
<p>it been open ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; we made out to open it be-
</p>
<p>tween us. It was locked. We found keys

<p>A. It is on the northwest corner of Sev-
</p>
<p>enth and H streets.

<p>Q. Who gave it to you?
</p>
<p>A. We took it when we found that it be-
</p>
<p>longed to Spangler.
</p>

</p>
<p>29

</p>
<p>door.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it on the nortkeast or southeast cor-

</p>
<p>Q. You were in front of the theatre during
</p>
<p>the performance of the second act?
</p>
<p>A. During the performance of the second
</p>
<p>act 1 was in front, I think, to the best of my
</p>
<p>linowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. All the time?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not all the time.
</p>
<p>Q. How much of the time?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I would walk in and
</p>
<p>maybe stay five or ten minutes and then walk
</p>
<p>out again.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you saw the pris-
</p>
<p>oner Spangler at any time during that play
</p>
<p>in front of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see him in front of the the-
</p>
<p>atre. I do not think he could have been
</p>
<p>there in front of the theatre without my
</p>
<p>knowing it, because the scenes would have
</p>
<p>gone wrong if he had left the stage any
</p>
<p>length of time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Spangler wear a mous-
</p>
<p>tache ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; he has never worn one since
</p>
<p>I have known him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know how he was dressed that
</p>
<p>evening?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I do not ; I did not take par-
</p>
<p>ticular notice.
</p>
<p>Q. How was he ordinarily dressed during
</p>
<p>that period ?
</p>
<p>A. Just about the same as he is now, as far
</p>
<p>as I have seen. Lately, during the last four
</p>
<p>or five weeks, he has been wearing the clothes
</p>
<p>he has on now.

</p>
<p>Q. Was not the play of the American
</p>
<p>Cousin a play in which the scenes were
</p>
<p>shifted a good deal?
</p>
<p>A. They were what we call "plain-sail-
</p>
<p>ing," running-on scenes. There is but one
</p>
<p>set scene in the piece.
</p>
<p>Q. There was not much shifting, then?
</p>
<p>A. Hi one act the most of the scenes are
</p>
<p>changed ; but that is in the first groove, and,
</p>
<p>therefore, it only takes two men to change
</p>
<p>them until we get to two, and then it takes
</p>
<p>four men.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the scenes shifted much in the
</p>
<p>play?
</p>
<p>A. I believe there are some five or six
</p>
<p>scenes in each act. I do not know  I cannot
</p>
<p>call to mind now  how many scenes are in
</p>
<p>each act.
</p>
<p>Q. Then Spangler's presence there would
</p>
<p>have been indispensable to the performance?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. If he had not been there his
</p>
<p>scene would not have gone on.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was with him on duty on thatside
</p>
<p>that night?
</p>
<p>A. Ritterspaugh  I think that is the name
</p>
<p>vyas with him at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Booth call Spangler that
</p>
<p>night?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was Spangler's connection with
</p>
<p>Booth  what had he to do with him?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing that I know of, further than
</p>
<p>friendly. Everybody about the house was
</p>
<p>friendlv with him.
</p>
<p>Q. With Booth?
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>the wooden bar,] would probably have been
</p>
<p>put in for any purpose connected with that
</p>
<p>object.
</p>
<p>A. I do not know what they could have
</p>
<p>been done for.
</p>
<p>Q. You think they could not, in any way,
</p>
<p>have facMitated that object?
</p>
<p>A. They might have. If this strip was
</p>
<p>too short, this block would fit in behind there
</p>
<p>so f,s to make an abutment for it.
</p>
<p>Q. But that was a part of the stick; it was
</p>
<p>on the stick, and was sawed off b}' a curios-
</p>
<p>ity-hunter. Would these nails have been put
</p>
<p>in there for any purpose connected with the
</p>
<p>fastening of the door?
</p>
<p>A. No. sir ; I see no use for them there.
</p>
<p>This bevelled edge would keep it from slip-
</p>
<p>ping down the door, and the other end being
</p>
<p>in the mortise, it would not require anything
</p>
<p>to keep it from slipping down.
</p>
<p>Q. ,Hovv long would it have taken, with an
</p>
<p>ordinary penknile, to cut that hole in the wall
</p>
<p>you speak of ?
</p>
<p>A. I should suppose a man intent on mis-
</p>
<p>chief would do it in some ten or fifteen min-
</p>
<p>utes. After the tace of the plastering is bro-
</p>
<p>ken, the sand and lime runs out very easy.
</p>
<p>Q. I believe you have said that you do not
</p>
<p>know how the lock on the door of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's box came to be loose ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you first hear that the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident was coming to the theatre that night?
</p>
<p>A. I judge it was between eleven and

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether he was invited

<p>to the theatre?

<p>A. I do not know.

<p>MAY 22.
</p>
<p>Jacob Ritterspaugh,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being
</p>
<p>duly sworn, testified as follows :
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Edward
</p>
<p>Spansler?
</p>
<p>A.^Ido.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where he lived in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington until he was arrested ?
</p>
<p>A. He boarded where I board.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was that?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Scott's, on the corner of Seventh
</p>
<p>and G streets.
</p>
<p>Q. Who arrested him .'
</p>
<p>A. I do not know, I was not there at the
</p>
<p>time he was arrested.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the name of the house ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know ; there is no number on
</p>
<p>the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Whoowns'it?
</p>
<p>A. A Mr. Ford, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Does he live in it?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; Mrs. Scott has it leased from
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford.
</p>
<p>Q. Who lives in the house ?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Scott.
</p>
<p>Q. Who occupied the room with Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A. He never slept there ; he just took hi?
</p>
<p>meals; that was all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he have a room in the house?
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>ing, his face came in full view. At the same i hand side of the alley, brought the horse for-
</p>
<p>instant I rose up and attempted to leap on j ward and spurred him, and at the same in-
</p>
<p>the stage directly from where I sat. My foot ; stant crouched forward down over the pom-
</p>
<p>slipped from the rail. My eye, at the same j mel of the saddle, and the horse went forward
</p>
<p>time, discovered the distance, and, without I then and soon swept to the left up towards F
</p>
<p>stopping my motion at all, I turned and street. 1 still ran after the horse some forty
</p>
<p>made two or three steps on the railing and ) or fifty yards. I commanded the person to
</p>
<p>jumped on the stage to the right of tlie foot | stop in the alley. The horse went on rapidly
</p>
<p>lights where I sat, keeping my attention all j after starting forward. It all occupied a space
</p>
<p>the time, after selecting my course, upon the I of a few seconds from the time 1 reached the
</p>
<p>man wlo was crossing the stage, and who stage until this occurred.
</p>
<p>had just jumped from the President's box. Q. You say you found the door closed ; did
</p>
<p>"When I reached the stage, as I was reaching | you see anybody standing about the door ?
</p>
<p>it, looliing in an angle to the left, I perceived | A. I Jid.
</p>
<p>that he disappeared at the same instant
</p>
<p>around the leit-hand stage entrance. Being
</p>
<p>on the stage, I crossed it as quick as possible.
</p>
<p>I had never been on the stage, and knew
</p>
<p>nothing about the condition of the building
</p>
<p>or the means of exit ; but I supposed the per-
</p>
<p>son was getting out, and I followed the di-
</p>
<p>Q. One or more persons ?
</p>
<p>A. I passed several person in that passage
</p>
<p>way, ladies and gentlemen  one or two men;
</p>
<p>I think in all perhaps five persons, as near as
</p>
<p>I could estimate without beinu able to count
</p>
<p>them. Near the door on my right hand side
</p>
<p>I passed a person standing, who seemed to be
</p>
<p>rectiou he touk. I exclaimed, ' Stop that in the act of turning. I was noticing every-
</p>
<p>man " three times. The last time, and when I thintr that came before me, as I was impressed
</p>
<p>I had passed the lennth of the stage and ! with what had occurred, and I saw a person
</p>
<p>turned to the right, and when I suppose with
</p>
<p>in a distance of from twenty to twenty -five
</p>
<p>feet from the door, the door slammed deci-

</p>
<p>dedly  came to, closed. I was going just as
</p>
<p>fast as I could, and got to the door of course
</p>
<p>very quickly. Coming against the door, I
</p>
<p>touched it first on the side where it did not
</p>
<p>open. I then caught hold of the door at the
</p>
<p>proper point, opened it, and passed out. The
</p>
<p>last time that I exclaimed. "Stop that man,"
</p>
<p>some one said, '"He is getting on a horse;"
</p>
<p>and at the door, almost as soon as the words
</p>
<p>reached my eais, I heard the tramping of a
</p>
<p>horse. On opening the door after the balk at
</p>
<p>the door which prevented me from opening it
</p>
<p>at first, I perceived a man mountiuL' a horse.
</p>
<p>He was at that instant rather imperfectly
</p>
<p>mounted ; the moon was just beginning to
</p>
<p>rise, and I could see a little elevated better
</p>
<p>than I could immediately down to the ground.
</p>
<p>The horse was moving in a quick, aaiitated
</p>
<p>motion, as a horse will do if prematurely
</p>
<p>spurred in mounting with the rein drawn a
</p>
<p>little to one side ; and for a moment the horse
</p>
<p>who did hot seem to be moving about like the
</p>
<p>others. Every one else I saw but that one
</p>
<p>person was in a terrible commotion and mov-
</p>
<p>ing about.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you describe that person's ap-
</p>
<p>pearance ; do you think you would recognize
</p>
<p>him atrain?
</p>
<p>A. I would not like to undertake to recog-
</p>
<p>nize him positively, but I have a very distinct
</p>
<p>impression in my mind about the size and
</p>
<p>appearance of that man.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at the prisoners here and say
</p>
<p>whether either of them, in your opinion, is
</p>
<p>that person .'
</p>

</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. There is a pussage-way between the
</p>
<p>scenes and the green-room, about two and a
</p>
<p>half or three feet ia width, through which
</p>
<p>Booth ran as he passed out of the door. Was
</p>
<p>it in that passage-wa.y that you met this per-
</p>
<p>son, or was it between the scenes?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know where the green-room
</p>
<p>is. I never was on the stage before If T
</p>
<p>had a diagram of the building, I could point
</p>
<p>out the spot.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the diagram
</p>
<p>heretofore offered in evidence and marked
</p>
<p>Exhibit No. 48.] This is a plan of the thea-
</p>
<p>tre ; now describe the locality.
</p>
<p>A. When I was coming through the pass-
</p>
<p>age from the front of the stage to the door I
</p>
<p>saw a person near the side door, as I ad-
</p>
<p>vanced in that direction rapidly, and I ob-
</p>
<p>served a person standing at the outer door,
</p>
<p>who, as I have described, was turning from
</p>
<p>the right to ihe left when I noticed him. It
</p>
<p>was in what you may call the passage  the
</p>
<p>one that leads from the front to the rear of
</p>
<p>the theatre, after passing over the stage and
</p>
<p>turning to the right  going towards the
</p>
<p>email door.
</p>
<p>Q. About how far from the door did the
</p>
<p>man stand ?
</p>
<p>A. About three feet.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice him there just after the
</p>
<p>door closed ?
</p>
<p>A. Just after it slammed. I was approach-
</p>
<p>ing the door. It was my expectation when I

</p>
<p>reached the stage to catch the person who
</p>
<p>had jumped from the President's box, inside
</p>
<p>of the house or very soon after he should get
</p>
<p>out of it, and I was watching very closely
</p>
<p>every person whom I approached.
</p>
<p>Q. If this man had been the person who
</p>
<p>slammed the door would you have noticed
</p>
<p>him doing it?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. A person standing in that po-
</p>
<p>sition could, by a reach of the arm, have
</p>
<p>slammed the door, and I could not have no-
</p>
<p>ticed it.
</p>
<p>Q. But would not that have thrown him
</p>
<p>around?  would it not have given him a mo-
</p>
<p>tion different from the motion that he was
</p>
<p>making as you approached?
</p>
<p>A. I recollect well me action of the door.
</p>
<p>It is a narrow door  not a wide door. Ap-
</p>
<p>proaching It. it opens inwards to the right as
</p>
<p>you approach. When I came against the
</p>
<p>door, I came with my hand, and somewhat
</p>
<p>damaged my hand against a part of the
</p>
<p>hinge. The door was very narrow, and any
</p>
<p>one standing in that man's position could
</p>
<p>have slamni't-d the door very easily by reach-
</p>
<p>ing his band to it.
</p>
<p>Q. Which way does the door open  to-
</p>
<p>wards the side that the President was on, or
</p>
<p>from the side that the President was on ?
</p>
<p>A. Approaching the door from the stage to
</p>
<p>the rear, it hinges from the right to the left.
</p>
<p>Entering it from the outside, it would swing
</p>
<p>back from the left to the right to the inside.
</p>
<p>1 came violently against the door when I
</p>
<p>went to open it.
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>Q. Please mark also the positions of the
</p>
<p>other persons that you saw in the passage, as
</p>
<p>near as you can ?
</p>
<p>The witness marked the position as indica-
</p>
<p>ted, by the question, and added :
</p>
<p>I have made these marks as indicating, as
</p>
<p>near as I could from a judgement in such a
</p>
<p>rapid transit as I was making of the position
</p>
<p>of the persons I met.
</p>
<p>Q. State as well as you can recollect wheth-
</p>
<p>er the persons you saw there were genilemen
</p>
<p>or ladies 7
</p>
<p>A. I think the majority of the persons that
</p>
<p>I observed were ladies.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice Miss Laura Keene?
</p>
<p>A. I did not, particularly ; I should find
</p>
<p>it difficult to have noticed particularly any of
</p>
<p>the ladies, unless I had some means of know-
</p>
<p>ing them, or had my attention called to them,
</p>
<p>any more than I knew that they were there,
</p>
<p>that they came out. All those persous, up to
</p>
<p>the point I described, were very much agita-
</p>
<p>ted seemed very much conftistd. I saw
</p>
<p>another person to the right, or rather caught
</p>
<p>a glimpse of him, but that person was con-
</p>
<p>siderably in to the right of where the person
</p>
<p>was that I described as being near the door,
</p>
<p>and was moving.
</p>
<p>Q. Moving'which way ?
</p>
<p>A. In on the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Moving from the door?
</p>
<p>A. He was moving almost at right angles
</p>
<p>to my course, off to my right.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he moving away from the door, or

</p>
<p>getting nearer to the door ?
</p>
<p>A. He was moving away to the right, not
</p>
<p>moving away from a straight line v\ith the
</p>
<p>door, but that person had not come from the
</p>
<p>door, or I would have seen him,
</p>
<p>Q. You mean that as he moved he got fur-
</p>
<p>ther from the door ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; further from the door and fur-
</p>
<p>ther from me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice any person in the alley
</p>
<p>except the one who mounted and rode off?
</p>
<p>A. As I passed out of the door, on the right
</p>
<p>side, a small person passed directly under my
</p>
<p>ri^ht elbow. I c;iught a glimpse of and
</p>
<p>rather felt the person. As I approached the
</p>
<p>horse at the nearest point  I got to the horse
</p>
<p>before he was sheared around from the right
</p>
<p>to the left  some one ran rapidly out of the
</p>
<p>alley.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it probably the person you noticed
</p>
<p>passing at your elbow ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; that person never passed me ;
</p>
<p>he was left behind me, wherever he went to.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you recognize that person if you
</p>
<p>saw him.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I could not. There was no
</p>
<p>light inside by which I could lecognize him.
</p>
<p>The person, whoever it was, was a small per-
</p>
<p>son.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he as tall a person as the prisoner
</p>
<p>Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I should think not by four or
</p>
<p>five inches.
</p>
<p>Q. Could yon see whether the person who
</p>
<p>you now think was Spangler wore any whis-
</p>
<p>$T.
</p>
<p>Q. I believe you returned to the theatre, af-
</p>
<p>ter yon chased Booth up the alley ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You then came back to this door?
</p>
<p>A. I entered the same door that I had gone
</p>
<p>out of.
</p>
<p>Q. Do 3'ou not recollect meeting the pris-
</p>
<p>oner Spangler as you came back?
</p>
<p>A. If I did, I did not notice him in par-
</p>
<p>ticular. When I got out from the door and
</p>
<p>from the time I reached the stage, I saw no
</p>
<p>one behind me, nor did I see any jierson after
</p>
<p>I passed beyond the door except the person
</p>
<p>on the hotse whom I believed to be Mr. John
</p>
<p>Wilki?s Booth, until I had run as far as I did
</p>
<p>run after the horse, which was around the
</p>
<p>alley and up to the left some little distance.
</p>
<p>I then turned and came back and saw that
</p>
<p>nobody had come out from the theatre up to
</p>
<p>that time. I asked some of the people in the
</p>
<p>buildings bacK if ihey had seen more than
</p>
<p>one horse there, and how long they had seen
</p>
<p>the horse there; aud 1 got some answers from
</p>
<p>them which occupied but a moment aud then
</p>
<p>went on into the theatre. One of the persons
</p>
<p>stated that he had seen one horse there and
</p>
<p>that was all they seemed to know. When I
</p>
<p>got inside the door again, I met four or five
</p>
<p>persons approaching the door, and just at the
</p>
<p>door one person, a policeman, a man with a
</p>
<p>police mark on and not this prisoner. Inside
</p>
<p>the door a number of persons came against
</p>
<p>me ; the persons rapidly accumulated on my
</p>
<p>observation, returning into the house ; the

</p>
<p>stage, the scenes, and the passage ways were
</p>
<p>all filling up.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect asking when you came
</p>
<p>in who that person was, or who it was that
</p>
<p>shot the President?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes; I asked that question several
</p>
<p>times.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect this prisoner Spangler
</p>
<p>answering your question, saying it was
</p>
<p>Booth?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I do not. I asked this ques-
</p>
<p>tion and recollect that one person answered
</p>
<p>it  "Are you satisfied it was Booth?" 
</p>
<p>'^ Have you any doubt it was Booth ?" That
</p>
<p>was my belief, and I was rather eliciting the
</p>
<p>views of others. I would not undertake to
</p>
<p>say that he might not have been one of the
</p>
<p>persons who heard me ask the question, and,
</p>
<p>deeming it addressed to him, answered it ;
</p>
<p>but I am not aware of addressing any ques-
</p>
<p>tion directly to that person.
</p>
<p>Q. When you got out of the door, the per-
</p>
<p>son was just rising into his saddle, was
</p>
<p>be?
</p>
<p>A. He was in his saddle, crouching for-
</p>
<p>ward, his left foot was in the stirrup ; be was
</p>
<p>leaning to the left; the horse was moving
</p>
<p>with a quick sort of motion, making appa-
</p>
<p>rently more exertion than headway at that
</p>
<p>time, but still going pretty fast, and circling
</p>
<p>around. He was sufficiently mounted to go
</p>
<p>with the horse without being unbalanced; he
</p>
<p>was getting the horse under control very fast
</p>
<p>for a forward movement.
</p>
<p>Q. You canuot say, then, that he had just
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. After I went out and re-
</p>
<p>turned, I took my family home, and imme-
</p>
<p>diately ran down the street toward Mr. Stan-
</p>
<p>ton's. I perceived persons in front of there
</p>
<p>and then turned and went rapidly to the po-
</p>
<p>lice-station and gave my name and the in-
</p>
<p>formation I had to Superintendent Richards,
</p>
<p>of the police, and upon bis cjucstion, said to
</p>
<p>him that I believed I knew who it was that
</p>
<p>had committed the deed ; that I believed it
</p>
<p>was Booth, and he said he believed so too.
</p>
<p>Q. You had known him before by sight.
</p>
<p>A. I had known him in this way : I had
</p>
<p>known him by sight, and 1 was some two
</p>
<p>years ago one evening at the Metropolitan
</p>
<p>Hotel introduced to him; I had seen him on
</p>
<p>the stage, and I had noticed him more dur-
</p>
<p>ing the last winter around the hotels. I
</p>
<p>went down two evenings to a hop at the Na
</p>
<p>tional Hotel with some ladies, and I noticeri
</p>
<p>him there leisurely around the parlor. I had
</p>
<p>not a doubt in my mind whom I was running
</p>
<p>after when I ran over the stage, and I should
</p>
<p>have been surprised to find it anybody else.
</p>
<p>I made every exertion to get through, and
</p>
<p>was astonished that the persons on the stage
</p>
<p>did not obstruct him, but they seemed very
</p>
<p>much bewildered. I felt a good deal vexed
</p>
<p>at his getting away, and had no doubt when
</p>
<p>I started on the stage that I could catch
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. How long should you judge it to be
</p>
<p>from the time you heard the d' or slam until

</p>
<p>jou saw the man balancing on his horse?
</p>
<p>A. Not over the time in which I could
</p>
<p>make two steps.
</p>
<p>Q. .Were you nearer the door when you
</p>
<p>heard it slam than the horse was on which
</p>
<p>was the man?
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot determine; for the horse
</p>
<p>was outside, and I was approaching the door
</p>
<p>through a passage-way that I had never been
</p>
<p>in before, and was only admonished of the
</p>
<p>position of the door by approaching it, and
</p>
<p>the slamming of the door indicated to me
</p>
<p>that there was a door, slammed right directly
</p>
<p>in front of the position I then occupied, and
</p>
<p>I am sure it could not have been over the
</p>
<p>second stride after that. As the light reflect-
</p>
<p>ed back along the passage-way the door came
</p>
<p>in view, and this person that J have described
</p>
<p>was in the position described, and turning
</p>
<p>towards me from the door, and I suppose in
</p>
<p>three strides more I was at the door.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you satisfied that the door was
</p>
<p>closed by some other person than the person
</p>
<p>who went out at the door ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot possibly be satisfied of that
</p>
<p>at all. There is nothing to exclude from my
</p>
<p>mind the possibility of the door having been
</p>
<p>closed by the person who went out  by Booth
</p>
<p>himself  but I did not see him close the door.
</p>
<p>The first notice of the door was on my ear,
</p>
<p>and in a moment it was in view. At the
</p>
<p>same moment I perceived the person standing
</p>
<p>as I have described, and the matter transpired
</p>
<p>then as I have stated, in my observation.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you satisfied that the person you
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>any means of knowing what their impressions
</p>
<p>were of the character of the occurrence ; they
</p>
<p>were in that state of agitation.

</p>
<p>since 1863.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. What has been your business at the
</p>
<p>theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. The property-man.
</p>
<p>Q. Do your duties require you to be on the
</p>
<p>stage while the performance is going on ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; if there is anything to do.
</p>
<p>There is a great deal of work to do generally.
</p>
<p>Sometimes there is nothing at all, and I go out.
</p>
<p>Q. What is your position on the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. To see that the furniture is put on there
</p>
<p>right ; to give the actors any side-jiroperties
</p>
<p>that are required to use in the piece.
</p>
<p>Q. What place on the st;ige is 3"ours  what
</p>
<p>part of the stage do you occupy?
</p>
<p>A. My room is not on the stage ; it is off
</p>
<p>the stage. I do not occupy any part of the
</p>
<p>stage particularly.
</p>
<p>Q. You have no position on the stage?
</p>
<p>A. No position on the stage proper.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the passage-way by which
</p>
<p>Booth escaped ?
</p>
<p>A. I was shown the passage-way. I did
</p>
<p>not see him escape that way.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state whether it is customar}'
</p>
<p>during a performance to have that passage-
</p>
<p>way clear or obstructed ?
</p>
<p>A. It is generally clear. I have never seen
</p>
<p>it blocked up. When we are playing a heavy
</p>

</p>
<p>"Don't say which way he went." I asked

<p>him what he meant by slapping me in the

<p>mouth, and he said "For God's sake, shut
</p>
<p>up," and that was the last he said.

<p>the knife gone out before you ?

<p>A. I did not see any one else.

</p>
<p>went out?

</p>
<p>play is going on in the theatre, if any-
</p>
<p>thing?

<p>A. My business is to shift wings on the
</p>
<p>stage and pull them off, and fetch things out
</p>
<p>of the cellar if they need anything.
</p>
<p>Q. State what sort of a man, if any, came
</p>
<p>out after you had gone out of the door.
</p>

</p>
<p>pretty stout man.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know him?

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How close to you \vas the big man who
</p>
<p>ran out after you ?
</p>
<p>A. He might have been perhaps five or six
</p>
<p>yards from me when I beard him holla,
</p>
<p>"Which way?" I do not know, I cannot say
</p>
<p>for certain, whether it was he or some one

<p>o'clock noon, half an hour after I came to the
</p>
<p>theatre myself.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not the fact that the
</p>
<p>President was going to the theatre that night
</p>
<p>was communicated to Booth
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I think very likely he
</p>
<p>found it out there. I am not certain whether
</p>
<p>he did or did not. I did not tell him. It
</p>
<p>might have been told there at the time that
</p>
<p>the President was coming.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see anything of Booth after-
</p>
<p>wards on that day?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; not until the evening.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him as you were going to
</p>
<p>the theatre that day ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I saw him coming down the
</p>
<p>street, I think, while I was standing in the
</p>
<p>door of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. State what he did then.
</p>
<p>A. He then went and commenced talking
</p>
<p>to the parties standing around. Mr. Raybold
</p>
<p>went into the house and brought him out a
</p>
<p>letter that was there for him ; he sat down
</p>
<p>on the steps and commenced to read it.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time was that he came there?
</p>
<p>A. About twelve o'clock noon.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did he sta)'?
</p>
<p>A. I should think he stayed about half
</p>
<p>an hour ; he conversed a while there and read
</p>
<p>the letter, and I went into the office; and
</p>
<p>when I came out again he had gone.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you know about the pre-
</p>
<p>paration of the theatre for the reception of
</p>
<p>the President at that time.

</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether he was apprised
</p>
<p>of the fact that the President was coming or
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. Oh yes, sir ; he knew the President was
</p>
<p>coming-, because he was taking out the par-
</p>
<p>tition.
</p>
<p>. Q. Do you know whether tliere was any
</p>
<p>penlcniCe used in the decoration of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's box, and what became of the pen-knife?
</p>
<p>A. I used the penknife in cutting the
</p>
<p>strings to tie up the flags and the picture of
</p>
<p>Washington, and left it there in the box.
</p>
<p>Q. You left it there?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you forget it?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; I forgot it.
</p>
<p>Q. Had the picture of Washington been
</p>
<p>there before?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Why was the chair that was there
</p>
<p>brought from your sleeping room to the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident's box?
</p>
<p>A. Only because putting the other furni-
</p>
<p>ture in, I put the chair in with it, the chair
</p>
<p>belonged to the same set. The chair was in
</p>
<p>the reception room in the first place, and the
</p>
<p>ushers going in there and sitting in it greased
</p>
<p>it wiih their hair, and we bad to remove it
</p>
<p>up to our room, being a very nice chair. We
</p>
<p>put the red furniture in the box that day, and
</p>
<p>we put in the chair because it belonged to
</p>
<p>that set  that was the only reason for putting
</p>
<p>it in  30 as to make the box look as neat as
</p>
<p>possible.

</p>
<p>some time previous to the President's visit
</p>
<p>there; but I do not know about that.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not asking you about any burst-
</p>
<p>ing. I am asking you about the fact whether
</p>
<p>the screws were drawn so that tbe keepers
</p>
<p>of the lock would not hold the door at all, if
</p>
<p>there was a pressure against it, opening into
</p>
<p>the President's box, before that day.
</p>
<p>A. Not to my knowledge; I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you swear that they were not so
</p>
<p>drawn when you were decorating the box
</p>
<p>that day ?
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>A. Unless they met my brother, I do not
</p>
<p>think they could have had.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction did Booth go after
</p>
<p>he left the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him again between that
</p>
<p>time and 2 o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any means of knowing wheth-
</p>
<p>er he was at the theatre again or not duriog
</p>
<p>that time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth Sem to be in a hurry to
</p>
<p>complete this conversation, read the letter,
</p>
<p>and get away from the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When he learned the fact that the Pre-
</p>
<p>sident would be there that evening, did you
</p>
<p>notice any particular change in his manner
</p>
<p>or appearance?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, he appeared the same as ever
</p>
<p>He sat on the step, opened his letter, and
</p>
<p>commenced to read it, looking up now and
</p>
<p>then and laughing.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingh.^m :
</p>
<p>Q. Booth knew at noon that the President
</p>
<p>was to be there that evening ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>fact?

</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I do not know his name.
</p>
<p>Q. You think, then, that Booth could not
</p>
<p>have been at the theatre during that visit
</p>
<p>more than half an hour altogether in read-
</p>
<p>ing that letter, and this conversation and
</p>
<p>everything ?
</p>
<p>A. He might have been more; lam not
</p>
<p>positive. I think it was about half an hour,
</p>
<p>though, from the time he came until I found
</p>
<p>that he had gone. When he came I went
</p>
<p>and spoke to him and then went into the box
</p>
<p>oflBce; and when I came out again, in about
</p>
<p>half an hour's time, he was gone.
</p>
<p>Q. Did this conversation take place in the
</p>
<p>vestibule of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; it was out in front of the gal-
</p>
<p>lery steps, the first door below the ofiBce door.
</p>
<p>Q. On the sidewalk ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; on the pavement.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was he when he read the letter ?
</p>
<p>A. He walked up and sat on the step of
</p>
<p>the main entrance door of the theatre, and
</p>
<p>read his letter.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge
</p>
<p>who was with Booth at the tim'fe he got
</p>
<p>through reading the letter and went away ?
</p>
<p>A. There were men around there talking
</p>
<p>to him. Mr. Gilford was there, I think; and
</p>
<p>I think Mr. Evans and Mr. Grillot.
</p>
<p>Q. Is Mr. Evans an attache of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, an actor there.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>. Q. You say Booth knew at noon that the
</p>
<p>President was to be in that theatre that
</p>
<p>night?
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Would jou have been likely to notice

<p>graph of John H. Surratt] S:ate if you ever
</p>
<p>saw a gentleman about the theatre resem-
</p>
<p>bling that picture.
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember of any. I never

<p>saw that face that I know of; it is not fomil-
</p>
<p>iar to me at all.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner, Arnold,
</p>
<p>about the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Or anywhere?
</p>
<p>A. No,' sir.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You never saw him anywhere, in any
</p>
<p>place ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know him?

<p>By Mr Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. It was published in the Evening Star?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you state in the drinking saloon on
</p>
<p>Tenth street, during that day, that the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent was to be there in the evening ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, I might have stated so.
</p>
<p>Q. Then it was known before the Evening
</p>
<p>Star was published?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, around the vicinity of the
</p>
<p>theatre.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. Was it announced that General Grant
</p>
<p>was to attend the theatre in company with
</p>
<p>the President?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>William Withers, Jr.
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, Edward Spangler.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing:
</p>
<p>Q. In your previous examination you were
</p>
<p>unable to state definitely whether or not the
</p>
<p>door leading into the alley from the passage
</p>
<p>was shut when Booth rushed out. Can you
</p>
<p>now state definitely whether it was or not?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, the door was shut.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect that fact distinctly ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. After he made the spring,
</p>
<p>after he gave me the cut and knocked me
</p>
<p>down to the first entrance, 1 got a side view
</p>
<p>of him, and I saw that he made a plunge
</p>
<p>right at the door. The door was shut, but
</p>
<p>it opened very easily. I saw that distinctly.
</p>
<p>He made a rush at the knob of the door and
</p>
<p>out he went and pulled the door after him.
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>Q. Had he been at the theatre before ? I
</p>
<p>A. He was coming from towards the thea-
</p>
<p>tre. 1 was coming from the Treasury build-
</p>
<p>ing mj'self.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you any Icnowledge of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's intention to visit the theatre that night
</p>
<p>prior to the receipt of this message?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have anything to do with the
</p>
<p>decoration of the box that the President was
</p>
<p>to occupy, and if so, what ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I had nothing to do witK'it,
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not procure anything to deco-
</p>
<p>rate it with ?
</p>
<p>A. I procured the flags from the Treasury
</p>
<p>Department.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you able to get all the flags that
</p>
<p>you wished for the decoration of the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I was not. I wished to procure
</p>
<p>a thirty-six feet flag which Captain Jones
</p>
<p>could not procure for me, he said.
</p>
<p>Q State whether, upon any occasion, you
</p>
<p>have had any conversation with Booth as to
</p>
<p>the purchase of lands, and if so, where?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. 1 ob-
</p>
<p>ject to the question.
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG. Testimony has already been
</p>
<p>admitted on that point.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I
</p>
<p>know, but it is unimportant as to this man.
</p>
<p>There is no question about this man in the
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG. It is very important as to one
</p>
<p>of the prisoners.

</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. It
</p>
<p>cannot be important. This man cannot be
</p>
<p>evidence for any human being on that subject
</p>
<p>no matter what Booth said to him about it.
</p>
<p>I object to it on the ground that it is entirely
</p>
<p>incompetent, and has nothing in the world to
</p>
<p>do with the case. If this witness had been
</p>
<p>involved in it, I admit it might be asked with
</p>
<p>a view to exculpate him from any censure be-
</p>
<p>fore the public
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG. The Court will recollect that
</p>
<p>in Mr. Weichmann's testimony there was ev-
</p>
<p>idence introduced by the prosecution of an
</p>
<p>alleged interview between Dr. Mudd and
</p>
<p>Booth at the National Hotel, in the middle of
</p>
<p>January, which was introduced as a circum-
</p>
<p>stance showing his connectiou with the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, which Booth is supposed to have
</p>
<p>then had on foot. The accused, Dr. Mudd,
</p>
<p>is represented to have stated that the conver-
</p>
<p>sation related to the purchase of his lands in
</p>
<p>Maryland. I wish to show by this witness
</p>
<p>that Booth spoke to him frequently, through
</p>
<p>the course of the winter, of his speculations
</p>
<p> of his former speculations in oil lands,
</p>
<p>which are shown to have been actual specu-
</p>
<p>lations of the year before  and of his con-
</p>
<p>templating the investment of money in cheap
</p>
<p>lands in lower Maryland. The effect of the
</p>
<p>testimony is to show that the statement,
</p>
<p>which h;is been introduced against the ac-
</p>
<p>cused, Dr. Mudd, if it was made, was a bona
</p>
<p>fide st.<itement, and related to an actual pend-
</p>
<p>ing offer, or talk about the sale of his farm to
</p>
<p>Boiuh.
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>Q. Did you send a notice of the President's
</p>
<p>intended visit that evening to the theatre to
</p>
<p>the Evening Star?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether that notice
</p>
<p>announced that General Grant was to be there
</p>
<p>with him?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. At what time in the afternoon did you
</p>
<p>send that notice?
</p>
<p>A. I sent it about twelve o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning, as near as I can recollect.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. In whose handwriting was thatnotice?
</p>
<p>A. In my handwriting.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you write it?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. About what time did the edition con-
</p>
<p>taining that notice first appear ?
</p>
<p>A. About two o'clock, I should think.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that you sent
</p>
<p>that notice to the Star office before you met
</p>
<p>Booth coming up E street towards Eleventh?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any one in company with Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation with
</p>
<p>Booth that day ?
</p>
<p>A. I had no conversation with him ; I mere-
</p>
<p>ly spoke to him and asked 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You
</p>
<p>need not state anything about it.

</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Did you know John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a photograph
</p>
<p>of John H. Surrat.] Did you see a person of
</p>
<p>that description about the theatre that day ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I never remember seeing him.
</p>
<p>Q. At what thime did John McCoUough,
</p>
<p>the actor, leave the city ?
</p>
<p>A. He left when Mr. Forrest left. I believe
</p>
<p>that was the fourth week of January.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he to play an engagement with
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. McCollough return to this city
</p>
<p>in company with Mr. Forrest, on the 1st of
</p>
<p>March ?
</p>
<p>A. He did, on Mr. Forrest's last engage-
</p>
<p>ment. I do not know what time that was.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it before the 1st of April ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was.
</p>
<p>Q. On what night was it that they played
</p>
<p>the "Apostate?"
</p>
<p>A. It was on Saturday night.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge
</p>
<p>whether McCollough had left the city or not
</p>
<p>before the first of April ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did Mr. Forrest leave?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect the time of his last
</p>
<p>engagement, but he left after his engagement
</p>
<p>was over.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you the means at the theatre of
</p>
<p>verifying the facts as to when Mr. Forrest
</p>
<p>and Mr. McCullough did leave?
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>Q. What did jou do?
</p>
<p>A. I went over to where Mr. Spangler was,
</p>
<p>on the left-hand side, at his post, and calleil"
</p>
<p>him from his post. Said I, "Mr. Booth wants
</p>
<p>you to hold his horse." He then went to the
</p>
<p>door, went outside, and was there about a
</p>
<p>minute, and Mr. Booth came in. He asked
</p>
<p>me if he could get across the stage. I told
</p>
<p>him no, the dairy scene was on, and that he
</p>
<p>would have to go under the stage, and co e
</p>
<p>up on the other side. About the time that
</p>
<p>he got upon the other side, Spangler called
</p>
<p>to me, "Tell Peanut John to come here and
</p>
<p>hold this horse; I have not time; Mr. Gif-
</p>
<p>ford is out in front of the theatre and all the
</p>
<p>responsibility of the scents lies on me." I
</p>
<p>went on the other side and called John, and
</p>
<p>John went there and held the horse, and
</p>
<p>Spangler came in and returned to his post
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler any more that
</p>
<p>evening?
</p>
<p>A. I did, three or four times that evening.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. On the stage.
</p>
<p>Q In his proper position ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At what times during the play?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say for certain what times.
</p>
<p>It was between and during the acts.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him about the time the shot
</p>
<p>was fired ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him about two minutes before
</p>
<p>that, I think.

</p>
<p>Q. Where was he then?
</p>
<p>A. He was on the same side I was on  the
</p>
<p>same side as the President's box.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him after the shot was
</p>
<p>fired ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; about five minutes after-
</p>
<p>wards.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. Standing on the stage with a crowd of
</p>
<p>people. There was a big crowd collected on
</p>
<p>the stasre then.
</p>
<p>Q. What was he doing then?
</p>
<p>A. I did not take any notice of him at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Booth as he left ?
</p>
<p>A. 1 saw him when he made his exit. I
</p>
<p>was standing in the first entrance, left-hand
</p>
<p>side. When he came to the centre of the
</p>
<p>stage I saw that he had a long knife in his
</p>
<p>hand. It seemed to me to be a double-edged
</p>
<p>knife, and looked like a new one. He paused
</p>
<p>about a second, I should think, and then
</p>
<p>went off, the first entrance right-band side.
</p>
<p>Q. Did j'ou see anybody follow him soon?
</p>
<p>A. 1 think he had time to get out the back
</p>
<p>door before any person was on the stage.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You
</p>
<p>need not state what you think; state what
</p>
<p>you saw.
</p>
<p>The Witness. I did not see the man get
</p>
<p>on the stage until he made his exit.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it after he made his exit
</p>
<p>that you saw any man get on the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say exactly ; I should say about
</p>
<p>two or three seconds.
</p>
<p>Q. After be had passed out?
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him there at that time?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>James J. Giffokd,
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, Edward Spangler.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know anythincr of a horse and
</p>
<p>buspy belongrinsr to Booth having bec-u sold
</p>
<p>a week or so before the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. 1 heard Mr. Booth tell Mr. Spangler to
</p>
<p>sell the horse and buggy on Monday even-
</p>
<p>ing, one week previous to the assassination 
</p>
<p>to take it down the Tattersall and sell it.
</p>
<p>Q. The Tattersall is a horse market in the
</p>
<p>city?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who sold the horse and buggy ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Spnngler, I presume.
</p>
<p>Q. Who receircd the money from the sale?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Spangler brought the man up with
</p>
<p>him, and asked me to count the money and
</p>
<p>give him a receipt. Mr. Richard Ford wrote
</p>
<p>the receipt ; I took the money and handed it
</p>
<p>over to Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know Jacob Ritterspaugh, who
</p>
<p>was a witness called yesterday ?
</p>
<p>A. 1 know a man that works at the theatre
</p>
<p>of that name ; I am not much acquainted with
</p>
<p>him. He was only there some four weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, since the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation and previotis to his release from Car-
</p>
<p>roll prison, he told you at the prison tbat the
</p>

</p>
<p>hit him in the face with the back of his hand
</p>
<p>and said, "Don't fay which way he went."
</p>
<p>A. To the best of my knowledge, I never
</p>
<p>heard him say so. He asked me if he could
</p>
<p>amend the statement that he had made. He
</p>
<p>said he had not told all he knew, and he
</p>
<p>asked me if he could amend it. I told him
</p>
<p>certainly, but he ought to be particular and
</p>
<p>state the truth of what he knew. That is all
</p>
<p>the conversation we ever had regarding it.
</p>
<p>He told me he had made a misstatement, and
</p>
<p>had not told all he knew.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say what he had omitted ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say that Spangler bad slapped
</p>
<p>him on the face ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; not to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say that Spangler had said,
</p>
<p>" Don't say which way he went ?"
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q Did he say anythine to (hat efFtct ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, nothingof that kind at all to me.
</p>
<p>Q. If he had said it you would likely have
</p>
<p>recollected it?
</p>
<p>A. 1 shoul.i reco'lect it, I think, from the
</p>
<p>short time that has elapsed, and my mind be-
</p>
<p>ing placed on the thing altogether. I have
</p>
<p>had nothing else to think about but this case
</p>
<p>since I have been in the Old Capitol.
</p>
<p>Q. You think you certainly would Lave
</p>
<p>recollected it if he had told you ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. He seemed in a great deal
</p>
<p>i)f trouble about not making a full statement,
</p>
<p>and he ask^d me about it, and I told him c-'r-
</p>
<p>tainly they would allow him to correct any-
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>ticular about the size. There is no strain on
</p>
<p>the rope.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett:
</p>
<p>Q. At Ihe places where the.y go crab-fish-
</p>
<p>ing thev have lines there, have they not?
</p>
<p>A. Souietinies thej^ have on the shore, and
</p>
<p>sometimes persons carry them with them.
</p>
<p>Q. There have to be little lines attached to
</p>
<p>the large line?
</p>
<p>A. 'i es, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And it requires considerable work to
</p>
<p>get the line into shape?
</p>
<p>A, Yes, sir; the}' have to take and stretch
</p>
<p>it all out and play it over the shore, and
</p>
<p>straigliten it all out.
</p>
<p>Q. They usually have them ready made?
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes the people on the shore have
</p>
<p>them, and sometimes peojjle going from Bal-
</p>
<p>timore tnke them with them.
</p>
<p>Q. That rope is not ready for doing any
</p>
<p>fishing now, is it?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, it is not in condition.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at the theatre at 12 o'clock
</p>
<p>on Friday, the 14th of April, when J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth came there?
</p>
<p>A. I saw Mr. Booth pass between half-past
</p>
<p>eleven and twelve o'clock. I do not know
</p>
<p>exactly the moment.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any conversation with
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I saw him go past the stage
</p>
<p>entrance and go to the front door. He bowed
</p>
<p>to me, but I did not have any conversation

<p>with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you standing on the sidewalk at
</p>
<p>that time?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I was standing in the alley
</p>
<p>gate, the entrance to the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Who else was there at that time?
</p>
<p>A. I think one of the Mr. Ford's wag at
</p>
<p>the front door. I am not certain, perhaps
</p>
<p>both of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Mr. Evans there?
</p>
<p>A . T did not see him.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Mr. Grillot there?
</p>
<p>A. He might have tieen standing in his
</p>
<p>door for all I know. I did not see him. I
</p>
<p>was standing inside the alley gate.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any of the conversation
</p>
<p>going on at that time, if any, between Booth
</p>
<p>and the party with him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I heard none at all. He came
</p>
<p>up by himself.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you what time it was that John
</p>
<p>McCullough left the city last?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I could not tell you.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any means of finding out?
</p>
<p>A. T could tell you the lastnight he played
</p>
<p>if I was at the theatre, but I cannot tell you
</p>
<p>what time he left the city.l
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You say that Jacob told you he was
</p>
<p>greatly troubled because he had not made a
</p>
<p>full statement, and wanted to correct it?
</p>
<p>A. He (old me he was feared before; that
</p>
<p>he could not tell what he was doing, and he
</p>
<p>asked me if he could not make a correct state-
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it after the assassination
</p>
<p>before he was imprisoned ?
</p>
<p>A. They had him once or twice in the
</p>
<p>station-house, I believe. I do not recollect
</p>
<p>the date.
</p>
<p>Q. But it was some days after the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation before he left the boarding house, was
</p>
<p>it not?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>a witness called for the accused, Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler, being duly sworn, testified as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the accused,
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, I am.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you boarded with
</p>
<p>him previous to his arrest.
</p>
<p>A. He boarded in the same house.
</p>
<p>Q. How long had you boarded with him
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. I, have boarded there, off and on, the
</p>
<p>last three years
</p>
<p>Q. How long has he boarded there?
</p>
<p>A. To my certain knowledge, he has
</p>
<p>boarded there, off and on, for six or seven
</p>
<p>months, if not longer. I am not certain as
</p>
<p>to the time.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, after the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation, and up to the time of his arrest, you
</p>
<p>saw him about the boarding house as usual.
</p>
<p>A. To my certain knowledge, I saw him,
</p>
<p>some two or three days after the assassina-

<p>tion, about the house. I will not be very
</p>
<p>certain about the time; but I think 1 saw him
</p>
<p>for two or three days.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him wear a moustache ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. What time of day did you see him
</p>
<p>about the house?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him in the mornings and even-
</p>
<p>ings, as 1 came from work. I work here in
</p>
<p>the arsenal, and generally take my dinner
</p>
<p>with me.
</p>
<p>Q. What days of the week did you see
</p>
<p>him ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not certain what days they were.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not sleep at that house?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>Thomas J. Raybold,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler, being duly sworn, testified as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing.-
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you lived in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, and what has latterly been your employ-
</p>
<p>ment here?
</p>
<p>A. I have not lived permanently in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington. On the first Monday of December
</p>
<p>one year ago  the day Congress went in
</p>
<p>session  I recollect it well  1 came to Wash
</p>
<p>ington for Mr. Ford. I was employed there
</p>
<p>rather to take charge of the house, see to all
</p>
<p>the front of the house, purchased everything
</p>
<p>that was purchased for the house. If the
</p>
<p>repair of anything was needed in the front of
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>gether into one, -which door was used to
</p>
<p>enter the double box?
</p>
<p>A. AIwujs the door to No. 8 the one I
</p>
<p>burst open.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether that was the door
</p>
<p>which was used on the night of the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation ?
</p>
<p>A. It was; the other one could not te
</p>
<p>used.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the lock was
</p>
<p>repaired after having been burst open?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I never examined it after-
</p>
<p>wards. I snj^pose it would have been my
</p>
<p>place to report ii; but I never paid any
</p>
<p>attention at all to it afterwards  never
</p>
<p>thought of it, in fact, after that night. I
</p>
<p>frequently entered the box afterwards; always
</p>
<p>passed in without a key into the box, and
</p>
<p>never thought of having the lock fixed.
</p>
<p>Q. To whom would you have reported it for
</p>
<p>repairs ?
</p>
<p>A. To Mr. Gifford.
</p>
<p>Q. And you made no report of it to him?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I never said anything about
</p>
<p>that  never thought of it  in fact, never
</p>
<p>thought it worth while mentioning it.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether the locks were of any
</p>
<p>use?
</p>
<p>A. The locks were but used to keep persons
</p>
<p>out when the boxes were not engaged. I have
</p>
<p>had frequently to go and order persons out of
</p>
<p>the boxes when they were left open. That
</p>
<p>was merely why the locks were used. After
</p>
<p>persons entered the box this door was mostly

</p>
<p>always left open. I have known it on several
</p>
<p>occasions to be left open.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you say whether the door was
</p>
<p>locked at the time you burst it open?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; I know it was locked. I tried
</p>
<p>the door and could not open it. I forced
</p>
<p>with my shoulder against it. It was securely
</p>
<p>f;istened. I stood from it with my back, and
</p>
<p>put mv foot against it, right close to the lock,
</p>
<p>and the door flew open. I never examined
</p>
<p>it after I did that to know what condition it
</p>
<p>was in. I never thought of it afterwards to
</p>
<p>examine it.
</p>
<p>Q. But you frequently entered the box
</p>
<p>afterwards?
</p>
<p>A. I did on two or three occasions after-
</p>
<p>wards enter it, I know.
</p>
<p>Q. And found no difficulty in entering it ?
</p>
<p>A. No difficulty at all.
</p>
<p>Q. No necessity for using a key?
</p>
<p>A. No. sir; there was no necessity for me
</p>
<p>to use a key after that: at legist, I never took
</p>
<p>one with me. The keys generally were in
</p>
<p>the office during the day. During the night
</p>
<p>they were in possession of the usher.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you have any knowledge
</p>
<p>of Booth having occupied either of those
</p>
<p>boxes shortly before the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say precisely the time, but I
</p>
<p>think it was about two weeks prior to the
</p>
<p>14th of April that Mr. J. Wilkes Booth en-
</p>
<p>gaged the private box No. 4, and came to the
</p>
<p>office again in the afternoon; I was sitting in
</p>
<p>the vestibule at the time, and asked for an
</p>
<p>exchange of the box. I think the exchange
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>A. Not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. State if you know any reason why the
</p>
<p>rocking-chair in which the President is said to
</p>
<p>have sat that night should have been in the
</p>
<p>position it was in.
</p>
<p>A. I placed it in the position it was in on
</p>
<p>two or other occasions when the President oc-
</p>
<p>cupied that bo.x, simjjly because, if it had
</p>
<p>been in any other position in the box, the
</p>
<p>rockers would have been in the waj'. When
</p>
<p>the partition was taken down it left a trian-
</p>
<p>gular corner, and the rockers went into that
</p>
<p>corner, at the left of the balustrade of the
</p>
<p>box. The rockers went into that corner, and
</p>
<p>were out of the way. I cannot say what
</p>
<p>other purpose there was; that was the only
</p>
<p>reason why I put it there. I put it there on
</p>
<p>two occasions when the President was there,
</p>
<p>or, at least, had it put there myself.
</p>
<p>Q. When was thai?
</p>
<p>A. Last season, while Mr. Hackett was
</p>
<p>playing.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You mean last winter a year ago ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. It had not been used in there
</p>
<p>this last season up to this time, although the
</p>
<p>sofa and the other parts of the furniture had
</p>
<p>been.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State what you saw of Spangler, if any-
</p>
<p>thing, for several days after the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw him after the assassination,
</p>
<p>or; at least, I cannot recollect seeing him af-
</p>
<p>terwards. I only know that he was arrested

<p>in the house on Saturday morning, the morn-
</p>
<p>ing afterwards, but I did not see him, to the
</p>
<p>best of my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not about the theatre that morn-
</p>
<p>ing?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say. I do not know. I went
</p>
<p>home to Baltimore myself, where my family'
</p>
<p>reside, on Saturday night. I have always
</p>
<p>been in the habit of going there on Saturday
</p>
<p>night or Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you return ?
</p>
<p>A. I returned again on Monday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. The theatre was shut up when you re-
</p>
<p>turned ?
</p>
<p>A. It was.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the coil of
</p>
<p>rope found in S[)angler's carpet bag.] Look
</p>
<p>at this rope and state whether you know of
</p>
<p>such ropes being used about the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I cannot swear that this is
</p>
<p>the rope, but we use such ropes as this. We
</p>
<p>used such ropes as this at the lime of the
</p>
<p>Treasury Guard's ball to stretch from the lob-
</p>
<p>Vjy to the wings to hang on it the colors of
</p>
<p>different nations. I cannot say that this is
</p>
<p>the rope, but this is the kind of rope we used.
</p>
<p>Q. Examine this rope and see whether it
</p>
<p>has probably been in use.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say. I cannot swear to it.
</p>
<p>Q. Canyon not say whether it has been
</p>
<p>probably in use at all ?
</p>
<p>A. This rope has been in use. That I know
</p>
<p>from its appearance. It would have been
</p>
<p>lighter than this in color if it had not been
</p>
<p>used. Using ropes colors them.
</p>
<p>57-
</p>
<p>ture of the President, was actually at the
</p>
<p>same time endeavoring to induce Mr. Ford to
</p>
<p>employ Chester, iu order that he might get
</p>
<p>him here to the theatre and use him as an in-
</p>
<p>strument ; and it goes to affect the case of sev-
</p>
<p>eral prisoners at the bar ; the case of the pris-
</p>
<p>oner. Arnold, who in his confession, as or-
</p>
<p>ally detailed here, stated thnt the plan was to
</p>
<p>capture the President, and Chester corrobor-
</p>
<p>ates that; and also to assist the case of, the
</p>
<p>prisoner, ^^pangler, by showing that Booth
</p>
<p>was not able to get or did not get in the the-
</p>
<p>atre an\' instruments to assist him in t!ie pur-
</p>
<p>pose and was e'ndeavoring to get them brought
</p>
<p>there  men that he has previously manipula-
</p>
<p>ted. I think it is legitimate.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. Noth-
</p>
<p>ing can be clearer, if the Court please, than
</p>
<p>that it is utterly incompetent. It is not a
</p>
<p>simple question of relevancy here; it is ab-
</p>
<p>solute incompetency. A party who conspires
</p>
<p>to do a crime may approach the most upright
</p>
<p>man in the world with whom he has been,
</p>
<p>before the criminality was known to the
</p>
<p>world, on terms of intimacy, and whose po-
</p>
<p>sition in the world was such tha* he might
</p>
<p>be on terms of intimacy with reputable gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen. It is the misfortune of a man that
</p>
<p>is approached in that way ; it is not his crime,
</p>
<p>and it is not colorably his crime either. It
</p>
<p>does not follow now, because Booth chose to
</p>
<p>approach this man Chester, that Booth is
</p>
<p>therefore armed with the power, living or
</p>
<p>dead, to come into a court of justice and prove

</p>
<p>on his own motion, or on the motion of any-
</p>
<p>bodj' else, what he may have said touching
</p>
<p>that man to third persons. The law is too
</p>
<p>jealous of the reputation and character of
</p>
<p>men to permit any such dealings at all.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Ewing.] State what were the
</p>
<p>duties of the accused, Edward Spangler, on
</p>
<p>the stage.
</p>
<p>A. Spangler was employed as a stage hand,
</p>
<p>frequently misrepresented as the stage-car-
</p>
<p>penter of the theatre. He was a laborer to
</p>
<p>assist in the shoving of scenery iuto its place,
</p>
<p>and removing it within the grooves as the
</p>
<p>necessity of the play required. These wei'e
</p>
<p>his duties at night, and during thedaj- to as-
</p>
<p>sist in doihg the rough carpenter work inci-
</p>
<p>dental to plays to be produced.
</p>
<p>Q. State wlielher or not his duties were
</p>
<p>such as to require his presence upon the stage
</p>
<p>during the whole of a play.
</p>
<p>A. Strictly so. His absence for a moment
</p>
<p>might imperil the success of a play, and cause
</p>
<p>dissatisfaction to the audienco. It is very
</p>
<p>important to the effect of a play that the
</p>
<p>scenery should be well attended to in all its
</p>
<p>changes ; and he is absolutely importint there
</p>
<p>every moment from the time the curtain rises
</p>
<p>until it falls. There are intervals, it is true,
</p>
<p>but he cannot judge how long or how brief a
</p>
<p>scene may be.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether his constant presence
</p>
<p>during the second scene of the third act of
</p>
<p>the "American Cousin" would be neces-
</p>
<p>sary.
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>near the stage manager, to receive his direc-
</p>
<p>tions and to be subordinate to him.
</p>
<p>Q. And the two are located on the stage,
</p>
<p>on the side opposite to that where the pris
</p>
<p>oner, Spangler, woriied upon?
</p>
<p>A. Directly opposite. They are on the
</p>
<p>prompt side; he on the 0. P. side  opposite
</p>
<p>the prompt place.
</p>
<p>Q. Then I understand that the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Spangler, would not be charged with the
</p>
<p>duty of keeping that passage-way in order?
</p>
<p>_ A. That was no duty of his, unless spe-
</p>
<p>cially assigned to him by the stage carpenter;
</p>
<p>he was subordinate entirely to the stage car-
</p>
<p>penter.
</p>
<p>Q. Now state whether or not that passage-
</p>
<p>way is generally obstructed in any way.
</p>
<p>A. It should never be obstructed. My posi-
</p>
<p>tive orders are iv keep it always clear and in
</p>
<p>the best order. It is the passage-way used
</p>
<p>by all the parties coming from the dressing-
</p>
<p>rooms. Where a play was performed like the
</p>
<p>"American Cousin" the ladies were in full
</p>
<p>dress, and it was absolutely accessary that
</p>
<p>there should be no obstruction there, in order
</p>
<p>that the play should be properly performed.
</p>
<p>Coming from the dressing-rooms and the
</p>
<p>green-room of the theatre every one had to
</p>
<p>use that passage. The other side of the stage
</p>

</p>
<p>the presence of the audience.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether as a matter of
</p>
<p>fact that passage-way was kept by the stage
</p>
<p>manager clear?
</p>
<p>A. The stage managf r was a very exacting
</p>
<p>man in all those details, and I have always
</p>
<p>found it clear, unless there was some spec-
</p>
<p>tacular play in which he required the whole
</p>
<p>spread of the stage. Then at times it would
</p>
<p>be partly encumbered, but not enough so to
</p>
<p>prevent the people going around the stage or
</p>
<p>going to the cellar-way and underneath and
</p>
<p>passing to the other side by way of the cellar.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the "American Cousin" such a
</p>
<p>spectacular play?
</p>
<p>A. No, it was a very plain play; no ob-
</p>
<p>struction whatever could be excused on ac-
</p>
<p>count of that play ; it was all what we call
</p>
<p>flats, except one scene ; the fiats are the large
</p>
<p>scenes that cross the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner, Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler, wear a moustache?
</p>
<p>A. Never.
</p>
<p>Q. State his relations to Booth, as f^ir as
</p>
<p>you have known them to be together at all.
</p>
<p>A. He seemed to have a great admiration
</p>
<p>for Booth. I have noticed that, in my busi-
</p>
<p>ness on tlie stage with the stage manager.
</p>
<p>Booth was a peculiarly fascinating man, and
</p>
<p>controlled the lower class of people, such as
</p>
<p>Spangler belonged to, I suppose more than
</p>
<p>ordinary men would  a man who excelled in
</p>
<p>all manly sports.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Spangler at all in the employment
</p>
<p>of Booth?
</p>
<p>59
</p>
<p>menced alioutthe 1st of September  say from
</p>
<p>the latter part of September up to the time I
</p>
<p>saw him last in Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that last time jou saw him?
</p>
<p>A. Some two or three weeks before the as-
</p>
<p>sination. Just previous to the assassination
</p>
<p>my wife was in bad' healtli, and I was not
</p>
<p>down here as frequently as I had been before.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you State wliether or not you were
</p>
<p>here about the 2d of April ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not positively, without some
</p>
<p>reflection. It is hard to locate a dale precise-
</p>
<p>ly. J usually came down here on Mondays,
</p>
<p>Wednesdays, and Fridays, but sometimes it
</p>
<p>was on Tuesdays, Thursday, and Saturdays.
</p>
<p>I cannot say positive that 1 was here on the
</p>
<p>day named.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where the actor John Mc-
</p>
<p>CuUough was then ?
</p>
<p>A. In New York, or at least he ought to
</p>
<p>have been there. Mr. Forrest was acting there
</p>
<p>and he always appears in his plays. His last
</p>
<p>appearance at my theatre was the 18th of
</p>
<p>March ; that, I believe, was the night the
</p>
<p>Apostate was played, and his last service in
</p>
<p>the theatre. Mr. Forrest was within a week
</p>
<p>to appear in New York, and he accompanied
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. vState whether or not you know anything
</p>
<p>of the prisoner, Spangler, having been in the
</p>
<p>habit of going to Baltimore, and for what,
</p>
<p>during the spring.
</p>
<p>A. 1 know that he had lived in Baltimore
</p>
<p>and buried his wife there some eight or ten

</p>
<p>months, or probably a year ago, whilst in my
</p>
<p>employ, and that he considered Baltimore his
</p>
<p>home, and usually spent the summer months,
</p>
<p>during the vacation of the theatre, there,
</p>
<p>chiefly in crabbing and fishing. He was a
</p>
<p>great fisher and crabber. I know nothing
</p>
<p>positive of my own knowledge as to that. I
</p>
<p>only heard tliat, and we used to plague him
</p>
<p>about it.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to witness the coil of rope
</p>
<p>found in a carpet bag at the house where
</p>
<p>Spangler toolv liis meals.] Look at that rope
</p>
<p>and see whether or not it might be used for
</p>
<p>any such purpose, and in what w:iy.
</p>
<p>A. I suppose that could be used as a crab
</p>
<p>line, though it is rather short for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Q. Explain to the Court how it could be
</p>
<p>used.
</p>
<p>A. I have seen them catch crabs witli a
</p>
<p>long rope, and with smaller ropes or lines ap-
</p>
<p>pended to it, which they fixed to it. The
</p>
<p>ropes are supported by buoys ; they spread
</p>
<p>them out to catch crabs. The professional
</p>
<p>crabbers use much longer ropes than this 
</p>
<p>those who make a business of it.
</p>
<p>Q. What length of rope have you seen used
</p>
<p>in that sport ?
</p>
<p>A, Four or five hundred feet.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen shorter ropes than that |
</p>
<p>used ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen some as short used. I have
</p>
<p>read that the length of this is eighty feet, but
</p>
<p>I do not know from its appearance.
</p>
<p>Q. This is such a rope as you have seen
</p>
<p>used by amateurs in that sport?
</p>
<p>eo
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; the authorized parties were
</p>
<p>my two brothers, James R. and Henry Clay
</p>
<p>Ford.
</p>
<p>Q Do you know the fact that none of the
</p>
<p>boxes were occuiiied th^t night except that
</p>
<p>occupied by the President?
</p>
<p>A. [ have only heard so.
</p>
<p>Q. Is the play of the "American Cousin"
</p>
<p>a popular one? Does it attract considerable
</p>
<p>audiences ?
</p>
<p>A. It was, when originally produced, an
</p>
<p>exceedingly attractive play ; of late years it
</p>
<p>has not been a strong card, but a fair attrac-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Q. Is "it not a very unusual thing, when
</p>
<p>such plaj's are produced, for your private
</p>
<p>boxes to be entirely empty ?
</p>
<p>A. Washington is a very good place for
</p>
<p>selling boxes usually. They are generally in
</p>
<p>demand, and nearly always two or three box-
</p>
<p>es are sold.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you recall any occasion on which a
</p>
<p>play so popular and attractive as that was
</p>
<p>presented when none of your private boxes,
</p>
<p>save the one occupied by the President, was
</p>
<p>used?
</p>
<p>A. I remember occasions when we sold no
</p>
<p>boxes at all, and had quite a full house  a
</p>
<p>good audience; but those occasions were rare.
</p>
<p>My reason for constructing so miny boxes to
</p>
<p>this theatre was that usually private boxes
</p>
<p>were in demand in Washington more so than
</p>
<p>in almost any other citj'. It is not a favora-
</p>
<p>ble place to see a performance, but it is a fash-

<p>ionable place here to take company.
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to say that from
</p>
<p>the charactpr of the two men, and their rela-
</p>
<p>tions to each other, as known to you, Booth
</p>
<p>would be likely to exert a large influence over
</p>
<p>the prisoner, Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A . I think he would, over men of that class
</p>
<p>that he came in contact with.
</p>
<p>Q. Either for good or evil, as it might chance
</p>
<p>to be ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Coort :
</p>
<p>Q. State the size of the rope usually used as
</p>
<p>a crab -rope?
</p>
<p>A. I merely know the length of the rope I
</p>
<p>have seen here.
</p>
<p>Q. Give the dimensions of it, the width
</p>
<p>around, by the usual rule of measurement?
</p>
<p>A. I have rather a bad eye for size. I sup-
</p>
<p>pose this rope is nearly an inch round in cir-
</p>
<p>cumference.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it at least an inch ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think so.

<p>J. P. Ferguson
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused Edward Spangler.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether, directly af-
</p>
<p>ter the assassination of the President, you
</p>
<p>saw Mr. Stewart get upon the stage.
</p>
<p>A. I am not personally acquainted with Mr.
</p>
<p>Stewart ; do not know that I know the gen-
</p>
<p>tleman at all ; I saw a gentleman, the first
</p>
<p>one who got upon the stage after Booth passed
</p>
<p>off. He was a lari;e man, dressed in light
</p>
<p>clothes, with a moustache. I do not know
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>Q. And jou caunot saj- anything about
</p>
<p>that?
</p>
<p>A. This large man was the first one that
</p>
<p>jumped on the stage.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Had the man any other -whisker beside
</p>
<p>a moustache?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think he had, but I Avill not
</p>
<p>be positive; he might have had.
</p>
<p>C. D. Hess,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Edward
</p>
<p>Spangler, being duly sworn, testified as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State your business here in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton.
</p>
<p>A. I am the manager of Grover's Theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that a theatre rival to Ford's?
</p>
<p>A. It is so considered. I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you were in the habit of
</p>
<p>seeing John Wilkes Booth during the last
</p>
<p>season before the assassination of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, very frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether he ever made any inquiry
</p>
<p>of you in regard to the President's attending
</p>
<p>your theatre.
</p>
<p>A. He did make such an inquiry.
</p>
<p>Q. When?
</p>
<p>A. 0,n the day before the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. State the circumstances under which
</p>
<p>the inquiry was made.
</p>
<p>A. He came into the office some time du-
</p>
<p>ring the afternoon, I think, of Thursday,

</p>
<p>interrupted me and the prompter of the the-
</p>
<p>atre in reading a manuscript, seated himself
</p>
<p>in a chair and entered into conversation on
</p>
<p>the subject of the illumination. There was
</p>
<p>to be a general illumination of the city on
</p>
<p>Thursday night, and he asked me if I in-
</p>
<p>tended to illuminate. I told him yes, I would
</p>
<p>illuminate to a certain extent that night, but
</p>
<p>that the next night would be my great night
</p>
<p>of the illumination, that being the celebration
</p>
<p>of the fall of Sumter. He asked me the
</p>
<p>question  my impression is his words were,
</p>
<p>"Do you intend" or "Are you going to in-
</p>
<p>vite the President?" I think my refily was,
</p>
<p>"Yes; that reminds me I must send that
</p>
<p>invitation." I had had it in my mind for
</p>
<p>several days to invite the Presidential party
</p>
<p>down on that night  on the night of the 14lh.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you invite the President?
</p>
<p>A. I sent Mrs. Lincoln an invitation. My
</p>
<p>notes were usually addressed to her as the
</p>
<p>best means of accomplishing the object.
</p>
<p>Q. Of getting the President there?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. That was on what day ?
</p>
<p>A. On Thursday  the day before the assas-
</p>
<p>sination.
</p>
<p>Q. And the invitation was for that night?
</p>
<p>A. For the following night, the night of
</p>
<p>the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there anything marked in Booth's
</p>
<p>manner in making this inquiry of you?
</p>
<p>A. It struck me as rather peculiar, his
</p>
<p>entering in the manner that he did; he must
</p>
<p>have observed that we were busy, and it was
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>the issue. We have introduced no evidence
</p>
<p>here touching any transaction in Grover's
</p>
<p>Theatre. It is Ford's Tlieatre that is before
</p>
<p>this Court. He purposes to go into a minute
</p>
<p>inquiry, I suppose, of all about Grover's The-
</p>
<p>atre, and how it is built, how its stage is
</p>
<p>constructed, its scenes, boxes, its avenues of
</p>
<p>approach, &c. I do not want to be delayed
</p>
<p>here with any such inquiry. I do not care
</p>
<p>anything about the structure of that build-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG. I wish no very minute inquiry
</p>
<p>in regard to Grover's Theatre; I merely wish
</p>
<p>to show the Court that from the consfruction
</p>
<p>of Ford's Theatre, it would be easier tor a
</p>
<p>man who sought to assassinate the President
</p>
<p>to escape after having committed the crime
</p>
<p>than it would be to escape from Grover's
</p>
<p>Theatre, had he committed the crime there.
</p>
<p>The purpose of it is very plain, to show why
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre was selected by Booth, why
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre is spoken of as having been
</p>
<p>the one where Booth intended to capture or
</p>
<p>assassinate the President, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>relieving the employees of Ford's Theatre,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Spangler among them, from the im-
</p>
<p>putation which naturally arises from the fact
</p>
<p>that Booth had selected that theatre as the one
</p>
<p>at which he intended to commit the crime.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bincjham. It is
</p>
<p>very apparent that nobody can be responsible
</p>
<p>for any act of Booth, uolcss by his own vol-
</p>
<p>untary act he assented to it; and the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of proof, therefore, about Grover's

<p>Theatre can neither excuse nor tend to excuse
</p>
<p>any man connected with Ford's Theatre for
</p>
<p>any act of his; and unless we prove the act
</p>
<p>of somebody at Ford's Theatre, they are not
</p>
<p>responsible for it, of course. But the attempt
</p>
<p>here is to prove the structure of Grover's
</p>
<p>Theatre, and that it is not as well adapted to
</p>
<p>assassination as Ford's; that is about the
</p>
<p>amount of it. I do not want to be delayed
</p>
<p>here with any inquiries about Grover's Thea-
</p>
<p>tre.
</p>
<p>The President. I do not think the Court
</p>
<p>need vote on that if the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>objects to it. The question is evidently im-
</p>
<p>proper and the Court so decides.
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG. I ask for a decision by the
</p>
<p>Commission.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.

<p>Henry M. James,

<p>Q. State whether you are acquainted with
</p>
<p>the prisoner Edward Spangler.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I have been for a short time.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you in Ford's Theatre when the
</p>
<p>President was assassinated ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. State your position and the position of
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler, if you know what it was,
</p>
<p>at that time.
</p>
<p>A. I was standing ready to draw off the
</p>
<p>flat, and Mr. Spangler was standing right
</p>
<p>opposite to me on the stage at the time it hap-
</p>
<p>pened.
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>Q. Whose business was it particularly to '
</p>
<p>see that it was clear ?
</p>
<p>A. It was mine and Spangler's to keep the
</p>
<p>passage clear.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it more your business than Spang-
</p>
<p>ler's?
</p>
<p>A. It was more Spangler's business.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not ihe passage on your side?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And it was part of your business to
</p>
<p>keep it clear ?
</p>
<p>A. It was part of my business to keep it
</p>
<p>clear.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler when the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent entered the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him standing on the opposite side
</p>
<p>from me when the President entered.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him at the time of the ap-
</p>
<p>plause which followed the President's entry
</p>
<p>occurred ?
</p>
<p>A. I did ; and he applauded with them.
</p>
<p>Q. How?
</p>
<p>A. Loud, with his hands and feet both ;
</p>
<p>clapped his hands and stamped his feet ; seem-
</p>
<p>ed as pleased as anybody to see the Presiden t
</p>
<p>come in.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see anything of Jacob Ritter-
</p>
<p>spaugh near Spangler that night?
</p>
<p>A. I did not. He might have been there
</p>
<p>behind some of the scenes ; I did not notice
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. He was not out of your view ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; not at the time it happened.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you stay where you were

</p>
<p>after it happened ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect. I might have stood
</p>
<p>there half a minute  maybe a minute  lean-
</p>
<p>not say, in the excitement.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Spangler say anything at
</p>
<p>that time?
</p>
<p>A. I did not. I did not see Spangler after
</p>
<p>it happened at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he go away?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Jacob Ritterspaugh, you say, might
</p>
<p>have been there behind the scenes, and you
</p>
<p>not have seen him ?
</p>
<p>A. He might have been.
</p>
<p>Q. He was employed there at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. It was his business to be there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :

<p>Q. His business to be where?
</p>
<p>A. Behind the scenes.

<p>A. Ever since I was about fourteen years
</p>
<p>old, more or less.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you have visited
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre to-day.
</p>
<p>A. I iiave.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you examined the keepers
</p>
<p>of the locks on any of the private boxes; if
</p>
<p>so, what ones, and what condition you found
</p>
<p>them in.
</p>
<p>A. T examined the keepers on boxes *I and
</p>
<p>8. To all appearances they had both been
</p>
<p>forced. The woodwork in box 8 is shivered
</p>
<p>and splintered by the screws. In box 7 I
</p>
<p>could pull the screw with my thumb and
</p>
<p>finger; the tap was gone clear to the point.
</p>
<p>I could force it back with my thumb. In

</p>
<p>box 4, which is directly under box 8, the
</p>
<p>keeper is gone entirely.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, according to your
</p>
<p>professional opinion, the keepers of the locks
</p>
<p>in boxes 7 and 8 were made loose by an in-
</p>
<p>strument or by force applied to the outside
</p>
<p>of the doors.
</p>
<p>A. I should judge by force.
</p>
<p>Q. Is there any appearance of an instru-
</p>
<p>ment having been used to draw the screws in
</p>
<p>either of those boxes ?
</p>
<p>A. I could see no such evidence.
</p>
<p>Q. You say the wood into which the
</p>
<p>screws of box 8 go is splintered?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Apparently by pressure from without
</p>
<p>against the door?
</p>
<p>A.. I should so suppose. According to my
</p>
<p>judgment, it was done by that means.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you noticed a hole in the
</p>
<p>wall in the passage which leads behind the
</p>
<p>boxes
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether that hole has any ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of having been covered?
</p>
<p>A. It certainly has been covered with a
</p>
<p>piece of something, I could not say what,
</p>
<p>because there has been no remnant of it left.
</p>
<p>Q. How large a piece?
</p>
<p>A. I did not charge my memory exactly
</p>
<p>with that, but I should suppose about five by
</p>
<p>seven and a half or eight inches in size, an
</p>
<p>oblong piece.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice a hole in the door of
</p>
<p>either of those two boxes ?

</p>
<p>My profession is that of a journalist, a reporter,
</p>
<p>and telegraphic correspondent.
</p>
<p>Q. Of the Associated Press?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will 3on state whether you were at
</p>
<p>Ford's TLeatre after the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President on Friday night, the 14th of April?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you learn there as to who
</p>
<p>was the assassin? Did you learn poiilively
</p>
<p>who it was?
</p>
<p>A. I heard some persons say positivel}'
</p>
<p>that it was Wilkes Booth; -iind oihers said
</p>
<p>that they knew Wilkes Booiii, but the man
</p>
<p>who jumped upon the btage and made his
</p>
<p>exit differed somewhat in ajipearance from
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth. There did not seem to be
</p>
<p>any certainty, so far as I could ascertain at
</p>
<p>that time.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was that after the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation?
</p>
<p>A. I was informed of the assassination, 1
</p>
<p>suppose, about twenty minutes to eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock, and I arrived at the theatre at five
</p>
<p>minutes to eleven that night.
</p>
<p>Q. ytate whether you became certain that
</p>
<p>night who it was that had killed the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent?
</p>
<p>A. I was not pofitively satisfied on that
</p>
<p>occasion, during that visit which I made to
</p>
<p>the theatie, in my own mind, who was the
</p>
<p>assassin.

<p>A. I was not perfectly satisfied of that fact.
</p>
<p>Q. Bui during the night you were?
</p>
<p>A. Not thoroughly satisfied.
</p>
<p>Q. You were so satisfied that night anyhow
</p>
<p>that you came to the conclusion that Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booih was probably the man, and so tele-
</p>
<p>graphed to the country?
</p>
<p>A. I did not telegraph that fact.
</p>
<p>Q. It was telegraphed ?
</p>
<p>A. It was telegraphed that night; I could
</p>
<p>tell by whom if neces-ary.
</p>
<p>Q. You came to the conclusion very sud-
</p>
<p>denly next morning that Wilkes Booth was
</p>
<p>the man ?
</p>
<p>A. After I saw the official bulletin the
</p>
<p>next morning. j

</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I
</p>
<p>Q. Did Bootli meet Spangler inside of the !
</p>
<p>door? I
</p>
<p>A. He was standin^r at the door ; lie was
</p>
<p>on the outside. The door was about half open |
</p>
<p>when Spangler went out. I
</p>
<p>Q. Would you have seen any person who |
</p>
<p>followed Spangler, and went out, too? I
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I think I should have seen any i
</p>
<p>one. I
</p>
<p>Q. And you did not see Sleickman? |
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. When Booth came in, what did he do ? j
</p>
<p>A. He went under the stage to the opposite '<
</p>
<p>side, and he went out the side door. j
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that he went out the
</p>
<p>side door?
</p>
<p>A. Because I went under the stage and
</p>
<p>crossed to the opposite side myself.
</p>
<p>Q. Didyou go under with Booth?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, I went under with him.
</p>
<p>Q. And he went out of the side-door?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he have any conversation with any
</p>
<p>one ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to m}' knowledge. I did not see
</p>
<p>him speak to any person.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you on the pavement in front of
</p>
<p>the theatre shortly before the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I was on the pavement about five min-
</p>
<p>utes before it occurred.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler in front there ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Spangler at any time

</p>
<p>wear a moustache ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen him wear a kind of rough
</p>
<p>whiskers, or rather unshaved. I never no-
</p>
<p>ticed particularly about a moustache.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him wear a heavy
</p>
<p>moustache ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I never did see him wear a heavy
</p>
<p>moustache while I was there, and that was
</p>
<p>about six months.
</p>
<p>Q. You knew Spangler well ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a man who would likely to be
</p>
<p>entrusted with the secrets of others?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I cannot tell. He is a
</p>
<p>man that was a little dissipated a big portion
</p>
<p>of the time, fond of spreeiug around, and I
</p>
<p>should not think a person would be likely to
</p>
<p>trust him.
</p>
<p>Q. How was he when in liquor? Was he
</p>
<p>inclined to be recreative or to talk much ?
</p>
<p>A. He was free in conversation, like a great
</p>
<p>many other persons, very free in talking.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You say that Booth went out at the side-
</p>
<p>door after passing under the stage ?

</p>
<p>Q. Do you meau that he went through the
</p>
<p>side-passage, level with the lower floor of the
</p>
<p>theatre, into Tenth street?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And you followed him through ?
</p>
<p>A. No, I did not follow him out there.
</p>
<p>Q. How do \ ou know he went out?
</p>
<p>A. He went out the side-door ; that is the
