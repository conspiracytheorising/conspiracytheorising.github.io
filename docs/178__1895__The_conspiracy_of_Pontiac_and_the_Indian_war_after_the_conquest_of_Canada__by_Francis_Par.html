<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>TO THE SIXTH EDITION.
</p>
<p>I chose the subject of this book as affording bet-
</p>
<p>ter opportunities than any other portion of Ameri-
</p>
<p>can history for portraying forest life and the Indian
</p>
<p>character ; and I have never seen reason to change
</p>
<p>this opinion. In the nineteen years that have
</p>
<p>passed since the first edition was published, a con-
</p>
<p>siderable amount of additional material has come
</p>
<p>to light. This has been carefully collected, and is
</p>
<p>incorporated in the present edition. The most
</p>
<p>interesting portion of this new material has been
</p>
<p>supplied by the Bouquet and Haldimand Papers,
</p>
<p>added some years ago to the manuscript collections
</p>
<p>of the British Museum. Among them are several
</p>
<p>hundred letters from officers engaged in the Pontiac
</p>
<p>wai some official, others personal and familiar,
</p>
<p>affording very curious illustrations of the events of
</p>
<p>the day and of the characters of those engaged in
</p>
<p>them. Among the facts which they bring to light,
</p>
<p>some are sufficiently startling ; as, for example, the

</p>
<p>proposal of the Commander-in-Chief to infect the

<p>Vlll PREFACE.
</p>
<p>hostile tribes with the small-pox, and that of a dis
</p>
<p>tinguished subordinate officer to take revenge on
</p>
<p>the Indians by permitting an unrestricted sale of
</p>
<p>rum.
</p>
<p>The two volumes of the present edition have
</p>
<p>been made uniform with those of the series " France
</p>
<p>and England in North America." I hope to con
</p>
<p>tinue that series to the period of the extinction of
</p>
<p>French power on this continent. " The Conspiracy
</p>
<p>of Pontiac " will then form a sequel ; and its intro-
</p>
<p>ductory chapters will be, in a certain sense, a sum-
</p>
<p>mary of what has preceded. This will involve
</p>
<p>some repetition in the beginning of the book, but I
</p>
<p>have nevertheless thought it best to let it remain
</p>
<p>as originally written.

</p>
<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>TO THE FIRST EDITION
</p>
<p>The conquest of Canada was an event of moment-
</p>
<p>ous consequence in American history. It changed
</p>
<p>the political aspect of the continent, prepared a
</p>
<p>way for the independence of the British colonies
</p>
<p>rescued the vast tracts of the interior from the rule
</p>
<p>of military despotism, and gave them, eventually,
</p>
<p>to the keeping of an ordert-d democracy. Yet to
</p>
<p>the red natives of the soil its results were wholly
</p>
<p>disastrous. Could the French have maintained
</p>
<p>their ground, the ruin of the Indian tribes might
</p>
<p>long have been postponed ; but the victory of Que-
</p>
<p>bec was the signal of their swift decline. Thence-
</p>
<p>forth they were destined to melt and vanish before
</p>
<p>the advancing waves of xlnglo- American power,
</p>
<p>which now rolled westward unchecked and unop-
</p>
<p>posed. They saw the danger, and, led by a great
</p>
<p>and daring champion, struggled fiercely to avert it.
</p>
<p>The history of that epoch, crowded as it is with
</p>
<p>scenes of tragic interest, with marvels of suffering

<p>and vicissitude, of heroism and endurance, has been ;
</p>
<p>X PREFACE
</p>
<p>as yet, unwritten buried in the archives of govern
</p>
<p>ments, or among the obscurer records of private
</p>
<p>adventure. To rescue it from oblivion is the object
</p>
<p>of the following work. It aims to portray the
</p>
<p>American forest and the American Indian at the
</p>
<p>period when both received their final doom.
</p>
<p>*- It is evident that other study than that of the
</p>
<p>closet is indispensable to success in such an attempt
</p>
<p>Habits of early reading had greatly aided to pre-
</p>
<p>pare me for the task ; but necessary knowledge of
</p>
<p>a more practical kind has been supplied by the
</p>
<p>indulgence of a strong natural taste, which, at
</p>
<p>various intervals, led me to the wild regions of the
</p>
<p>north and west. Here, by the camp-fire, or in the
</p>
<p>canoe, I gained familiar acquaintance with the men
</p>
<p>and scenery of the wilderness. In 1846, I visited
</p>
<p>various primitive tribes of the Rocky Mountains,
</p>
<p>and was, for a time, domesticated in a village of
</p>
<p>the western Dahcotah, on the high plains between
</p>
<p>Mount Laramie and the range of the Medicine
</p>
<p>Bow.
</p>
<p>The most troublesome part of the task was the
</p>
<p>collection of the necessary documents. These con
</p>
<p>sisted of letters, journals, reports, and despatches,
</p>
<p>scattered among numerous public offices, and pri-
</p>
<p>vate families, in Europe and America. When
</p>
<p>brought together, they amounted to about three
</p>
<p>thousand four hundred manuscript pages. Con-

</p>
<p>have also been examined, and careful search made
</p>
<p>for every book which, directly or indirectly, might
</p>
<p>throw light upon the subject. I have visited the
</p>
<p>sites of all the principal events recorded in the
</p>
<p>narrative, and gathered such local traditions as
</p>
<p>seemed worthy of confidence.
</p>
<p>I am indebted to the liberality of Hon. Lewis
</p>
<p>Cass for a curious collection of papers relating to
</p>
<p>the siege of Detroit by the Indians. Other impor-
</p>
<p>tant contributions have been obtained from the
</p>
<p>state paper offices of London and Paris, from the
</p>
<p>archives of New York, Pennsylvania, and other
</p>
<p>states, and from the manuscript collections of sev
</p>
<p>eral historical societies. The late William L. Stone,
</p>
<p>Esq., commenced an elaborate biography of Sir
</p>
<p>William Johnson, which it is much to be lamented
</p>
<p>he did not live to complete. By the kindness of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Stone, I was permitted to copy from his exten-
</p>
<p>sive collection of documents such portions as would
</p>
<p>serve the purposes of the following History.
</p>
<p>To President Sparks of Harvard University, Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Whiting, U. S. A., Brantz Mayer, Esq., of
</p>
<p>Baltimore, Francis J. Fisher, Esq., of Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>and Eev. George E. Ellis, of Charlestown, I beg to
</p>
<p>return a warm acknowledgment for counsel and
</p>
<p>assistance. Mr. Benjamin Perley Poore and Mr.
</p>
<p>Henry Stevens procured copies of valuable docu-
</p>
<p>ments from the archives of Paris and London.

<p>delphia, Dr. O'Callaghan, of Albany, George H
</p>
<p>Moore, Esq., of New York, Lyman C. Draper, Esq.,
</p>
<p>of Philadelphia, Judge Law, of Vincennes, and
</p>
<p>many others, have kindly contributed materials to
</p>
<p>the work. Nor can I withhold an expression of
</p>
<p>thanks to the aid so freely rendered in the dull task
</p>
<p>of proof-reading and correction.
</p>
<p>The crude and promiscuous mass of materials
</p>
<p>presented an aspect by no means inviting. The
</p>
<p>field of the history was uncultured and unreclaimed,
</p>
<p>and the labor that awaited me was like that of the
</p>
<p>border settler, who, before he builds his rugged
</p>
<p>dwelling, must fell the forest-trees, burn the under-
</p>
<p>growth, clear the ground, and hew the fallen trunks
</p>
<p>to due proportion.
</p>
<p>Several obstacles have retarded the progress of
</p>
<p>the work. Of these, one of the most considerable
</p>
<p>was the condition of my sight. For about three
</p>
<p>years, the light of day was insupportable, and every
</p>
<p>attempt at reading or writing completely debarred.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the task of sifting the
</p>
<p>materials and composing the work was begun and
</p>
<p>finished. The papers were repeatedly read aloud
</p>
<p>by an amanuensis, copious notes and extracts were
</p>
<p>made, and the narrative written down from my dic-
</p>
<p>tation. This process, though extremely slow and
</p>
<p>laborious, was not without its advantages ; and I
</p>
<p>am well convinced that the authorities havebeen

<p>collated, and more thoroughly digested, than they

<p>would have been under ordinary circumstances.
</p>
<p>In order to escape the tedious circumlocution,
</p>
<p>which, from the nature of the subject, could not
</p>
<p>otherwise have been avoided, the name English is
</p>
<p>applied, throughout the volume, to the British
</p>
<p>American colonists, as well as to the people of the
</p>
<p>mother country. The necessity is somewhat to be
</p>
<p>regretted, since, even at an early period, clear dis-
</p>
<p>tinctions were visible between the offshoot and the
</p>
<p>parent stock.

<p>THE
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF PONTIAC
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY.  INDIAN TRIBES EAST OF THE
</p>
<p>MISSISSIPPI.
</p>
<p>The Indian is a true child of the forest and ttie
</p>
<p>desert. The wastes and solitudes of nature are his
</p>
<p>congenial home. His haughty mind is imbued
</p>
<p>with the spirit of the wilderness, and the light of
</p>
<p>civilization falls on him with a blighting power.
</p>
<p>His unruly pride and untamed freedom are in har-
</p>
<p>mony with the lonely mountains, cataracts, and
</p>
<p>rivers among which he dwells ; and primitive
</p>
<p>America, with her savage scenery and savage men,
</p>
<p>opens to the imagination a boundless world, un-
</p>
<p>matched in wild sublimity.
</p>
<p>The Indians east of the Mississippi may be di-
</p>
<p>vided into se\eral great families, each distinguished
</p>
<p>by a radical peculiarity of language. In their
</p>
<p>moral and intellectual, their social and political

</p>
<p>state, these various families exhibit strong shades
</p>
<p>2 INDIAN TRIBES [Chat-. 1
</p>
<p>:>f distinction ; but, before pointing them out, 1
</p>
<p>shall indicate a few prominent characteristics,
</p>
<p>which, faintly or distinctly, mark the whole in com
</p>
<p>mon.
</p>
<p>All are alike a race ui hunters, sustaining life
</p>
<p>wholly, or in part, by the fruits of the chase. Each
</p>
<p>family is split into tribes ; and these tribes, by the
</p>
<p>exigencies of the hunter life, are again divided
</p>
<p>into sub-tribes, bands, or villages, often scatteied
</p>
<p>far asunder, over a wide extent of wilderness.
</p>
<p>Unhappily for the strength and harmony of the
</p>
<p>Indian race, each tribe is prone to regard itself,
</p>
<p>not as the member of a great whole, but as a sov-
</p>
<p>ereign and independent nation, often arrogating to
</p>
<p>itself an importance superior to all the rest of man
</p>
<p>kind ; x and the warrior whose petty horde might
</p>
<p>muster a few scores of half-starved fighting men,
</p>
<p>strikes his hand upon his heart, and exclaims, in
</p>
<p>all the pride of patriotism, " I am a Ifenomone."
</p>
<p>In an Indian community, each man is his own
</p>
<p>master. He abhors restraint, and owns no other au-
</p>
<p>thority than his own capricious will ; and yet this
</p>
<p>wild notion of liberty is not inconsistent with certain
</p>
<p>gradations of rank and influence. Each tribe has
</p>
<p>its sachem, or civil chief, whose office is in a man-
</p>
<p>ner hereditary, and, among many, though by no
</p>
<p>means among all tribes, descends in the female
</p>
<p>line ; so that the brother of the incumbent, or the
</p>
<p>son of his sister, and not his own son, is the right-
</p>
<p>1 Many Indian tribeslbear names which in their dialect signify men,
</p>
<p>indicating that the character belongs, par excellence, to them. Sometimes
</p>
<p>the word was used by itself, and sometimes an adjective was joined with

</p>
<p>ful successor to his dignities. 1 If, however, in the
</p>
<p>opinion of the old men and subordinate chiefs, the
</p>
<p>heir should be disqualified for the exercise of the
</p>
<p>office by cowardice, incapacity, or any defect of
</p>
<p>character, they do not scruple to discard him, and
</p>
<p>elect another in his place, usually fixing their
</p>
<p>choice on one of his relatives. The office of the
</p>
<p>sachem is no enviable one. He has neither laws
</p>
<p>to administer nor power to enforce his commands.
</p>
<p>His counsellors are the inferior chiefs and principal
</p>
<p>men of the tribe ; and he never sets himself in
</p>
<p>opposition to the popular will, which is the sover-
</p>
<p>eign power of these savage democracies. His
</p>
<p>province is to advise, and not to dictate ; but, should
</p>
<p>he be a man of energy, talent, and address, and
</p>
<p>especially should he be supported by numerous
</p>
<p>relatives and friends, he may often acquire no small
</p>
<p>measure of respect and power. A clear distinc
</p>
<p>tion is drawn between the civil and military author-
</p>
<p>ity, though both are often united in the same per-
</p>
<p>son The functions of war-chief may, for the most
</p>
<p>part, be exercised by any one whose prowess and
</p>
<p>reputation are sufficient to induce the young men
</p>
<p>to follow him to battle ; and he may, whenever he
</p>
<p>thinks proper, raise a band of volunteers, and go
</p>
<p>out against the common enemy.
</p>
<p>We might imagine that a society so loosely
</p>
<p>framed would soon resolve itself into anarchy ; yet
</p>
<p>this is not the case, and an Indian village is singu-
</p>
<p>1 The dread of female infidelity has been assigned, and with probable
</p>
<p>truth, as the origin of this custom. The sons of a chiefs sister must ne-
</p>
<p>cessarily be his kindred ; though his own reputed son may be, in fact, fh

</p>
<p>larly free from wranglings and petty strife Sev-
</p>
<p>eral causes conspire to this result. The necessities
</p>
<p>of the hunter life, preventing the accumulation of
</p>
<p>large communities, make more stringent organiza-
</p>
<p>tion needless ; while a species of self-control,
</p>
<p>inculcated from childhood upon every individual,
</p>
<p>enforced by a sentiment of dignity and manhood,
</p>
<p>and greatly aided by the peculiar temperament of
</p>
<p>the race, tends strongly to the promotion of har-
</p>
<p>mony. Though he owns no law, the Indian is
</p>
<p>inflexible in his adherence to ancient usages and
</p>
<p>customs ; and the principle of hero-worship, which
</p>
<p>belongs to his nature, inspires him with deep re-
</p>
<p>; spect for the sages and captains of his tribe. The
</p>
<p>very rudeness of his condition, and the absence of
</p>
<p>the passions which wealth, luxury, and the other
</p>
<p>incidents of civilization engender, are favorable to
</p>
<p>internal harmony ; and to the same cause must
</p>
<p>likewise be ascribed too many of his virtues, which
</p>
<p>would quickly vanish, were he elevated from his
</p>
<p>savage state.
</p>
<p>A peculiar social institution exists among the
</p>
<p>Indians, very curious in its character ; and though
</p>
<p>I am not prepared to say that it may be traced
</p>
<p>through all the tribes east of the Mississippi, yet
</p>
<p>its prevalence is so general, and its influence on
</p>
<p>political relations so important, as to claim especial
</p>
<p>attention. Indian communities, independently of
</p>
<p>their local distribution into tribes, bands, and vil-
</p>
<p>lages, are composed of several distinct clans. Each
</p>
<p>clan has its emblem, consisting of the figure of

</p>
<p>guished by the name of the animal which it thus
</p>
<p>bears as its device ; as, for example, the tlan of
</p>
<p>the Wolf, the Deer, the Otter, or the Hawk. In
</p>
<p>the language of the Algonquins, these emblems
</p>
<p>are known by the name of Totems. 1 The mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the same clan, being connected, or supposed
</p>
<p>to be so, by ties of kindred, more or less remote,
</p>
<p>are prohibited from intermarriage. Thus Wolf
</p>
<p>cannot marry Wolf ; but he may, if he chooses,
</p>
<p>take a wife from the clan of Hawks, or any other
</p>
<p>clan but his own. It follows that when this pro-
</p>
<p>hibition is rigidly observed, no single clan can live
</p>
<p>apart from the rest ; but the whole must be min-
</p>
<p>gled together, and in every family the husband and
</p>
<p>wife must be of different clans.
</p>
<p>To different totems attach different degrees of
</p>
<p>rank and dignity ; and those of the Bear, the Tor-
</p>
<p>toise, and the Wolf are among the first in honor.
</p>
<p>Each man is proud of his badge, jealously asserting
</p>
<p>its claims to respect ; and the members of the
</p>
<p>same clan, though they may, perhaps, speak differ-
</p>
<p>ent dialects, and dwell far asunder, are yet bound
</p>
<p>together by the closest ties of fraternity. If a
</p>
<p>man is killed, every member of the clan feels called

</p>
<p>or the warrior is sure of a cordial welcome in the
</p>
<p>distant lodge of the clansman whose face perhaps
</p>
<p>he has never seen. It may be added that certain
</p>
<p>privileges, highly prized as hereditary rights, some-
</p>
<p>times reside in particular clans ; such as that of
</p>
<p>furnishing a sachem to the tribe, or of performing
</p>
<p>certain religious ceremonies or magic rites.
</p>
<p>The Indians east of the Mississippi may be di-
</p>
<p>vided into three great families : the Iroquois, the
</p>
<p>Algonquin, and the Mobilian, each speaking a lan-
</p>
<p>guage of its own, varied by numerous dialectic
</p>
<p>forms. To these families must be added a few
</p>
<p>stragglers from the great western race of the Dah-
</p>
<p>cotah, besides several distinct tribes of the south,
</p>
<p>each of which has been regarded as speaking a
</p>
<p>tongue peculiar to itself. 1 The Mobilian group
</p>
<p>embraces the motley confederacy of the Creeks,
</p>
<p>the crafty Choctaws, and the stanch and warlike
</p>
<p>Chickasaws. Of these, and of the distinct tribes
</p>
<p>dwelling in their vicinity, or within their limits, I
</p>
<p>shall only observe that they offer, with many mod-
</p>
<p>ifications, and under different aspects, the same
</p>
<p>essential features which mark the Iroquois and
</p>
<p>the Algon quins, the two great families of the
</p>
<p>north. 2 The latter, who were the conspicuous

</p>
<p>latin, Trans. Am. Ant. Soc. II.
</p>
<p>2 It appears from several passages in the writings of Adair, Hawkins,
</p>
<p>and others, that the totem prevailed among the southern tribes. In a
</p>
<p>conversation with the late Albert Gallatin, he informed me that he waa
</p>
<p>told by the chiefs of a Choctaw deputation, at Washington, that in their
</p>
<p>tribe were eight totemic clans, divided into two classes, of four each.

<p>in their savage arts of policy, stood the fierce peo-
</p>
<p>ple called by themselves the Hodenosaunee, and
</p>
<p>by the French the Iroquois, a name which has
</p>
<p>since been applied to the entire family of which
</p>
<p>they formed the dominant member. 1 They extend-
</p>
<p>ed their conquests and their depredations from
</p>
<p>Quebec to the Carolinas, and from the western
</p>
<p>prairies to the forests of Maine. 2 On the south,
</p>
<p>they forced tribute from the subjugated Delawares,
</p>
<p>and pierced the mountain fastnesses of the Chero
</p>
<p>1 A great difficulty in the study of Indian history arises from a redun-
</p>
<p>dancy of names employed to designate the same tribe ; yet this does not
</p>
<p>prevent the same name from being often used to designate two or more
</p>
<p>different tribes. The following are the chief of those which are applied to
</p>
<p>the Iroquois by different writers, French, English, and German : 
</p>
<p>Iroquois, Five, and afterwards Six Nations ; Confederates, Hodenosau-
</p>
<p>nee, Aquanuscioni, Aggonnonshioni, Ongwe Honwe, Mengwe, Maquas,
</p>
<p>Mahaquase, Massawomecs, Palenachendchiesktajeet.
</p>
<p>The name of Massawomecs has been applied to several tribes ; and that
</p>
<p>of Mingoes is often restricted to a colony of the Iroquois which established
</p>
<p>itself near the Ohio.
</p>
<p>2 Francois, a well-known Indian belonging to the remnant of the Pe-
</p>
<p>nobscots living at Old Town, in Maine, told me, in the summer of 1813,
</p>
<p>that a tradition was current, among his people, of their being attacked in
</p>
<p>ancient times by the Mohawks, or, as he called them, Mohogs, a tribe of
</p>
<p>the Iroquois, who destroyed one of their villages, killed the men and
</p>
<p>women, and roasted the small children on forked sticks, like apples, before
</p>
<p>the fire. When he began to tell his story, Francois was engaged in patch
</p>
<p>ing an old canoe, in preparation for a moose hunt ; but soon growing warm
</p>
<p>with his recital, he gave over his work, and at the conclusion exclaimed

</p>
<p>uprooted the ancient settlements of the Wyandots ;
</p>
<p>on the west they exterminated the Eries and the
</p>
<p>Andastes, and spread havoc and dismay among
</p>
<p>the tribes of the Illinois ; and ' on the east, the
</p>
<p>Indians of New England fled at the first peal of
</p>
<p>the Mohawk war-cry. Nor was it the Indian race
</p>
<p>alone who quailed before their ferocious valor.
</p>
<p>All Canada shook with the fury of their onset;
</p>
<p>the people fled to the forts for refuge ; the blood-
</p>
<p>besmeared conquerors roamed like wolves among
</p>
<p>the burning settlements, and the colony trembled
</p>
<p>on the brink of ruin.
</p>
<p>The Iroquois in some measure owed their tn
</p>
<p>umphs to the position of their country ; for they
</p>
<p>dwelt within the present limits of the State of New
</p>
<p>York, whence several great rivers and the inland
</p>
<p>oceans of the northern lakes opened ready thorough
</p>
<p>fares to their roving warriors through all the adja
</p>
<p>cent wilderness. But the true fountain of their
</p>
<p>success is to be sought in their own inherent ener-
</p>
<p>gies, wrought to the most effective action under a
</p>
<p>political fabric well suited to the Indian life ; in
</p>
<p>their mental and moral organization ; in their in-

<p>satiable ambition and restless ferocity.

<p>wards added. 1 To each of these tribes belonged
</p>
<p>an organization of its own. Each had several

<p>sachems, who, with the subordinate chiefs and

<p>principal men, regulated all its internal affairs ;

<p>prescribed by time-bonored customs , and, in. the
</p>
<p>fiercest heat of controversy, the assembly main-
</p>
<p>tained its self-control.
</p>
<p>But the main stay of Iroquois polity was the
</p>
<p>system of totemship. It was this which gave the
</p>
<p>structure its elastic strength ; and but for this, a
</p>
<p>mere confederacy of jealous and warlike tribes
</p>
<p>must soon have been rent asunder by shocks from
</p>
<p>without or discord from within. At some early
</p>
<p>period, the Iroquois probably formed an individual
</p>
<p>nation ; for the whole people, irrespective of their
</p>
<p>separation into tribes, consisted of eight totemic
</p>
<p>clans ; and the members of each clan, to what
</p>
<p>nation soever they belonged, were mutually bound
</p>
<p>to one another by those close ties of fraternity
</p>
<p>which mark this singular institution. Thus the
</p>
<p>five nations of the confederacy were laced together
</p>
<p>by an eight-fold band ; and to this hour their slen-
</p>
<p>der remnants cling to one another with invincible
</p>
<p>tenacity.
</p>
<p>It was no small security to the liberties of the
</p>
<p>Troquois  liberties which they valued beyond any
</p>
<p>silence, smoking their pipes. The speaker uttered his words in a singing
</p>
<p>tone., always rising a few notes at the close of each sentence. Whatever
</p>
<p>was pleasing to the council was confirmed by all with the word Nee, or
</p>
<p>Yes. And, at the end of each speech, the whole company joined in ap-
</p>
<p>plauding the speaker by calling Hoho. At noon, two men entered bearing
</p>
<p>a large kettle filled with meat, upon a pole across their shoulders, which
</p>
<p>was first presented to the guests. A large wooden ladle, as broad and
</p>
<p>deep as a common bowl, hung with a hook to the side of the kettle, with
</p>
<p>which every one might at once help himself to as much as he could eat
</p>
<p>When the guests had eaten their fill, they begged the counsellors to do
</p>
<p>the same. The whole was conducted in a very decent and quiet manner.

<p>other possession  that by the Indian custom of
</p>
<p>descent in the female line, which among them was
</p>
<p>more rigidly ndhered to than elsewhere, the office
</p>
<p>of the sachem must pass, not to his son, but to his
</p>
<p>brother, his sister's son, or some yet remoter kins-
</p>
<p>man. His power was constantly deflected into the
</p>
<p>collateral branches of his family ; and thus one of
</p>
<p>the strongest temptations of ambition was cut off. 1
</p>
<p>The Iroquois had no laws ; but they had ancient
</p>
<p>customs which took the place of laws. Each man,
</p>
<p>or rather, each clan, was the avenger of its own
</p>
<p>wrongs ; but the manner of the retaliation was
</p>
<p>fixed by established usage. The tribal sachems,
</p>
<p>and even the great council at Onondaga, had no
</p>
<p>power to compel the execution of their decrees ;
</p>
<p>yet they were looked up to with a respect which
</p>
<p>the soldier's bayonet or the sheriff's staff would
</p>
<p>never have commanded ; and it is highly to the
</p>
<p>1 The descent of the sachemship in the female line was a custom
</p>
<p>universally prevalent among the Five Nations, or Iroquois proper. Since,
</p>
<p>among Indian tribes generally, the right of furnishing a sachem was
</p>
<p>vested in some particular totemic clan, it results of course that the descent
</p>
<p>of the sachemsliip must follow the descent of the totem ; that is, if the
</p>
<p>totemship descend in the female line, the sachemship must do the same.
</p>
<p>This custom of descent in the female line prevailed not only among the
</p>
<p>Iroquois proper, but also among the Wyandots, and probably among the
</p>
<p>Andastes and the Eries, extinct members of the great Iroquois family.
</p>
<p>Thus, among any of these tribes, when a Wolf warrior married a Hawk
</p>
<p>Bquaw, their children were Hawks, and not Wolves. With the Creeks
</p>
<p>of the south, according to the observations of Hawkins ( Georgia Hist.
</p>
<p>Coll. III. 69), the rule was the same ; but among the Algonquins, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, or at least among the northern branches of this family, the
</p>
<p>reverse took place, the totemships, and consequently the chieftainships,
</p>
<p>descending in the male line, after the analogy of civilized nations. For

<p>honor of the Indian character that they could
</p>
<p>exert so great an authority where there was
</p>
<p>nothing to enforce it but the weight of moral
</p>
<p>power. 1
</p>
<p>The origin of the Iroquois is lost in hopeless
</p>
<p>obscurity. That they came from the west ; that
</p>
<p>they came from the north ; that they sprang from
</p>
<p>the soil of New York, are the testimonies of three
</p>
<p>conflicting traditions, all equally worthless as aids
</p>
<p>to historic inquiry. 2 It is at the era of their con-
</p>
<p>federacy  the event to which the five tribes owed
</p>
<p>all their greatness and power, and to which we
</p>
<p>need assign no remoter date than that of a century
</p>
<p>before the first arrival of the Dutch in New York
</p>
<p> that faint rays of light begin to pierce the
</p>
<p>gloom, and the chaotic traditions of the earlier
</p>
<p>epoch mould themselves into forms more palpable
</p>
<p>and distinct.

<p>1 An account of the political institutions of the Iroquois will be found
</p>
<p>in Mr. Morgan's series of letters, published in the American Review for
</p>
<p>1847. Valuable information may also be obtained from Schoolcraft's Notes
</p>
<p>9n the Iroquois.
</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan is of opinion that these institutions were the result of " a
</p>
<p>^jDtracted effort of legislation." An examination of the customs prevail-
</p>
<p>ing among other Indian tribes makes it probable that the elements of the
</p>
<p>Iroquois polity existed among them from an indefinite antiquity ; and the
</p>
<p>legislation of which Mr. Morgan speaks could only involve the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment and adjustment of already existing materials.
</p>
<p>Since the above chapter was written, Mr. Morgan has published an
</p>
<p>elaborate and very able work on the institutions of the Iroquois. It forms
</p>
<p>ttn invaluable addition to this department of knowledge.

<p>to instruct his favorite people in the arts of savage
</p>
<p>life ; and when he saw how they were tormented by
</p>
<p>giants, monsters, and evil spirits, he urged the divi-
</p>
<p>ded tribes, for the common defence, to band them-
</p>
<p>selves together in an everlasting league. While
</p>
<p>the injunction was as yet unfulfilled, the sacred
</p>
<p>messenger was recalled to the Great Spirit ; but,
</p>
<p>before his departure, he promised that another
</p>
<p>should appear, empowered to instruct the people in
</p>
<p>all that pertained to their confederation. And ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, as a band of Mohawk warriors was
</p>
<p>threading the funereal labyrinth of an ancient pine
</p>
<p>forest, they heard, amid its blackest depths, a hoarse
</p>
<p>voice chanting in measured cadence ; and, following
</p>
<p>the sound, they saw, seated among the trees, a mon-
</p>
<p>ster so hideous, that they stood benumbed with ter-
</p>
<p>ror. His features were wild and frightful. He was
</p>
<p>encompassed by hissing rattlesnakes, which, Medu-
</p>
<p>sa-like, hung writhing from his head ; and on the
</p>
<p>ground around him were strewn implements of in-
</p>
<p>cantation, and magic vessels formed of human skulls.
</p>
<p>Recovering from their amazement, the warriors could
</p>
<p>perceive that in the mystic words of the chant, which
</p>
<p>he still poured forth, were couched the laws and
</p>
<p>principles of the destined confederacy. The tradi-
</p>
<p>tion further declares that the monster, being sur-
</p>
<p>rounded and captured, was presently transformed
</p>
<p>to human shape, that he became a chief of tran-
</p>
<p>scendent wisdom and prowess, and to the day of his
</p>
<p>death ruled the councils of the now united tribes.

<p>The traditional epoch which preceded the auspi-

<p>cious event of the confederacy, though wrapped in
</p>
<p>clouds and darkness, and defying historic scrutiny,
</p>
<p>has yet a character and meaning of its own. The

<p>gloom is peopled thick with phantoms ; with mon*

<p>sters and prodigies, shapes of wild enormity, yet
</p>
<p>offering, in the Teutonic strength of their concep-
</p>
<p>tion, the evidence of a robustness of mind unpar-
</p>
<p>alleled among tribes of a different lineage. In

<p>these evil days, the scattered and divided Iroquois
</p>
<p>were beset with every form of peril and disaster.

<p>the thunder-bolts of the skies could stay his rava-
</p>
<p>ges, and drive him back to his native deeps. The
</p>
<p>skeletons of men, victims of some monster of the
</p>
<p>forest, were seen swimming in the Lake of Teungk-

<p>too ; and around the Seneca village on the Hill of

<p>of size so monstrous that the wretched people were

<p>wounded at length by the magic arrow of a child,

<p>he rolled down the steep, sweeping away the forest

<p>with his writhings, and plunging into the lake be

<p>blackening shadows of the storm, they heard his

<p>deep shout roll along the firmament.
</p>
<p>The energy of fancy, whence these barbarous

<p>creations drew their birth, displayed itself, at a later

<p>period, in that peculiar eloquence which the wild

</p>
<p>to which the mountain and the forest, the torrent

<p>and the storm, lent their stores of noble imagery.
</p>
<p>That to this imaginative vigor was joined mental

<p>irony of Garangula and Sagoyewatha, and no less
</p>
<p>by the subtle policy, sagacious as it was treacherous,

<p>which marked the dealings of the Iroquois with

<p>Rurrounding tribes. 1

<p>With all this mental superiority, the arts of life
</p>
<p>among them had not emerged from thei~ primitive
</p>
<p>rudeness ; and their coarse pottery, their spear and
</p>
<p>arrow heads of stone, were in no way superior to
</p>
<p>those of many other tribes. Their agriculture de-
</p>
<p>serves a higher praise. In 1696, the invading
</p>
<p>army of Count Frontenac found the maize fields
</p>
<p>extending a league and a half or two leagues from
</p>
<p>their villages ; and, in 1779, the troops of General
</p>
<p>Sullivan were filled with amazement at their abun-
</p>
<p>dant stores of corn, beans, and squashes, and at
</p>
<p>the old apple orchards which grew around their
</p>
<p>settlements.
</p>
<p>Their dwellings and works of defence were far
</p>
<p>from contemptible, either in their dimensions or in
</p>
<p>their structure ; and though by the several attacks

<p>of the French, and especially by the invasion of
</p>
<p>De Nonville, in 1687, and of Frontenac, nine years
</p>
<p>later, their fortified towns were levelled to the earth,
</p>
<p>never again to reappear ; yet, in the works of Cham-
</p>
<p>plain and other early writers we find abundant evi-
</p>
<p>dence of their pristine condition. Along the banks

<p>on the romantic shores of Seneca Lake and the

<p>encompassed by palisades, in single, double, or triple
</p>
<p>rows, pierced with loopholes, furnished with plat-
</p>
<p>forms within, for the convenience of the defenders,
</p>
<p>with magazines of stones to hurl upon the heads of
</p>
<p>the enemy, and with water conductors to extinguish
</p>
<p>any fire which might be kindled from without. 1
</p>
<p>The area which these defences enclosed was often
</p>
<p>several acres in extent, and the dwellings, ranged in
</p>
<p>order within, were sometimes more than a hundred
</p>
<p>feet in length. Posts, firmly driven into the ground,
</p>
<p>with an intervening framework of poles, formed the
</p>
<p>basis of the structure; and its sides and arched
</p>
<p>roof were closely covered with layers of elm bark.
</p>
<p>Each of the larger dwellings contained several dis-
</p>
<p>tinct families, whose separate fires were built along
</p>
<p>the central space, while compartments on each side,
</p>
<p>like the stalls of a stable, afforded some degree of
</p>
<p>privacy. Here, rude couches were prepared, and
</p>
<p>bear and deer skins spread ; while above, the
</p>
<p>ripened ears of maize, suspended in rows, formed

<p>a golden tapestry. 2

<p>in an oblong form, with four bastions. The wall was formed of throo

</p>
<p>In the long evenings of midwinter, when in the
</p>
<p>wilderness without the trees cracked with biting
</p>
<p>cold, and the forest paths were clogged with snow,
</p>
<p>then, around the lodge-fires of the Iroquois, war
</p>
<p>riors, squaws, and restless naked children were
</p>
<p>clustered in social groups, each dark face brighten
</p>
<p>ing in the fickle firelight, while, with jest and laugh,
</p>
<p>the pipe passed round from hand to hand. Perhaps
</p>
<p>some shrivelled old warrior, the story-teller of the
</p>
<p>tribe, recounted to attentive ears the deeds of an-
</p>
<p>cient heroism, legends of spirits and monsters, or
</p>
<p>tales of witches and vampires  superstitions not
</p>
<p>less rife among this all-believing race, than among
</p>
<p>the nations of the transatlantic world.
</p>
<p>The life of the Iroquois, though void of those
</p>
<p>multiplying phases which vary the routine of civil-
</p>
<p>ized existence, was one of sharp excitement and
</p>
<p>sudden contrast. The chase, the war-path, the
</p>
<p>were placed over against us. This cabin is about eighty feet long and
</p>
<p>seventeen broad, the common passage six feet wide, and the apartments
</p>
<p>on each side five feet, raised a foot above the passage by a long sapling,
</p>
<p>hewed square, and fitted with joists that go from it to the back of the
</p>
<p>house ; on these joists they lay large pieces of bark, and on extraordinary
</p>
<p>occasions spread mats made of rushes : this favor we had ; on these floors
</p>
<p>they set or lye down, every one as he will ; the apartments are divided
</p>
<p>from each other by boards or bark, six or seven foot long, from the lower
</p>
<p>floor to the upper, on which they put their lumber ; when they have eaten
</p>
<p>their homony, as they set in each apartment before the fire, they can put
</p>
<p>the bowl over head, having not above five foot to reach ; they set on the
</p>
<p>floor sometimes at each end, but mostly at one ; they have a shed to put
</p>
<p>their wood into in the winter, or in the summer to set to converse or
</p>
<p>play, that has a door to the south ; all the sides and roof of the cabin are

<p>dance, the festival, the game of hazard, the race of
</p>
<p>political ambition, all had their votaries. When
</p>
<p>the assembled sachems had resolved on war against
</p>
<p>some foreign tribe, and when, from their great coun-
</p>
<p>cil-house of bark, in the Valley of Onondaga, their
</p>
<p>messengers had gone forth to invite the warriors to
</p>
<p>arms, then from east to west, through the farthest
</p>
<p>bounds of the confederacy, a thousand warlike
</p>
<p>hearts caught up the summons. With fasting and
</p>
<p>praying, and consulting dreams and omens ; with
</p>
<p>invoking the war god, and dancing the war-dance,
</p>
<p>the warriors sought to insure the triumph of then
</p>
<p>arms ; and then, their rites concluded, they be-
</p>
<p>gan their stealthy progress through the devious
</p>
<p>pathways of the forest. For days and weeks, in
</p>
<p>anxious expectation, the villagers awaited the re-
</p>
<p>sult. And now, as evening closed, a shrill, wild
</p>
<p>cry, pealing from afar, over the darkening forest,
</p>
<p>proclaimed the return of the victorious warriors.
</p>
<p>The village was alive with sudden commotion ; and
</p>
<p>snatching sticks and stones, knives and hatchets,
</p>
<p>men, women, and children, yelling like fiends let
</p>
<p>loose, swarmed out of the narrow portal, to visit
</p>
<p>upon the captives a foretaste of the deadlier tor
</p>
<p>ments in store for them. The black arches of the
</p>
<p>forest glowed with the fires of death ; and with
</p>
<p>orandished torch and firebrand the frenzied multi-
</p>
<p>tude closed around their victim. The pen shrinks
</p>
<p>to write, the heart sickens to conceive, the fierce-
</p>
<p>ness of his agony ; yet still, amid the din of his

<p>tormentors, rose his clear voice of scorn and defi-

<p>and hootings, the murderers sought to drive away
</p>
<p>the spirit of theii victim. 1
</p>
<p>The Iroquois reckoned these barbarities among
</p>
<p>their most exquisite enjoyments ; and yet they had
</p>
<p>other sources of pleasure, which made up in fre-
</p>
<p>quency and in innocence what they lacked in
</p>
<p>intensity. Each passing season had its feasts and
</p>
<p>dances, often mingling religion with social pastime.
</p>
<p>The young had their frolics and merry-makings ;
</p>
<p>and the old had their no less frequent councils,
</p>
<p>where conversation and laughter alternated with
</p>
<p>grave deliberations for the public weal. There
</p>
<p>were also stated periods marked by the recurrence
</p>
<p>of momentous ceremonies, in which the whole
</p>
<p>community took part  the mystic sacrifice of the
</p>
<p>dogs, the orgies of the dream feast, and the loath-
</p>
<p>some festival of the exhumation of the dead. Yet
</p>
<p>in the intervals of war and hunting, these resour-
</p>
<p>ces would often fail ; and, while the women were
</p>
<p>toiling in the cornfields, the lazy warriors beguiled

<p>the south-westward. They were of two nations, some whereof have few

</p>
<p>any Christians, and trade onely with one greatt house, nott farr from the

</p>
<p>If we seek for a single trait preeminently char-
</p>
<p>acteristic of the Iroquois, we shall find it in that
</p>
<p>boundless pride which impelled them to style them-
</p>
<p>selves, not inaptly as regards their own race, " the
</p>
<p>men surpassing all others." 2 " Must I," exclaimed

<p>among a crowd of Algonquins,  " must I, who

</p>
<p>with their pride. Their war-parties roamed over

</p>
<p>From this remarkable people, who with all the
</p>
<p>ferocity of tneir race blended heroic virtues and
</p>
<p>marked endowments of intellect, I pass to other
</p>
<p>members of the same great family, whose different
</p>
<p>fortunes may perhaps be ascribed rather to the
</p>
<p>force of circumstance, than to any intrinsic tnferi
</p>
<p>ority.
</p>
<p>The peninsula between the Lakes Huron, Erie,
</p>
<p>and Ontario was occupied by two distinct peoples,
</p>
<p>speaking dialects of the Iroquois tongue. The
</p>
<p>Hurons or Wyandots, including the tribe called by
</p>
<p>the French the Dionondadies, or Tobacco Nation, 1
</p>
<p>dwelt among the forests which bordered the east-
</p>
<p>ern shores of the fresh water sea, to which they
</p>
<p>have left their name ; while the Neutral Nation, so
</p>
<p>called from their neutrality in the war between the
</p>
<p>Hurons and the Five Nations, inhabited the north-
</p>
<p>ern shores of Lake Erie, and even extended their
</p>
<p>eastern flank across the strait of Niagara.
</p>
<p>The population of the Hurons has been variously
</p>
<p>stated at from ten thousand to thirty thousand
</p>
<p>gouls, but probably did not exceed the former esti-
</p>
<p>one Greenhalgh to ascertain their numbers. He visited all their townt
</p>
<p>and villages, and reported their aggregate force at two thousand one hun-
</p>
<p>Ired and fifty fighting men. The report of Colonel Coursey, agent from
</p>
<p>Virginia, at about the same period, closely corresponds with this state-
</p>
<p>ment. Greenhalgh's Journal will be found in Chalmers's Political Annals,
</p>
<p>and in the Documentary History of New York. Subsequent estimates, up
</p>
<p>to the period of the Revolution, when their strength had much declined,
</p>
<p>vary from twelve hundred to two thousand one hundred and twenty.
</p>
<p>Most of these estimates are given by Clinton, in his Discourse on the Fivt
</p>
<p>Nations, and several by Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia.

</p>
<p>parent that, in legends and superstitions, manners
</p>
<p>and habits, religious observances and social cus-
</p>
<p>toms, they were closely assimilated to their brethren
</p>
<p>of the Five Nations. Their capacious dwellings
</p>
<p>of bark, and their palisaded forts, seemed copied
</p>
<p>after the same model. 1 Like the Five Nations
</p>
<p>they were divided into tribes, and cross-divided into
</p>
<p>totemic clans ; and, as with them, the office of
</p>
<p>sachem descended in the female line. The same
</p>
<p>crude materials of a political fabric were to be
</p>
<p>found in both ; but, unlike the Iroquois, the Wy-
</p>
<p>andots had not as yet wrought them into a system,
</p>
<p>and woven them into a harmonious whole.
</p>
<p>Like the Five Nations, the Wyandots were in
</p>
<p>some measure an agricultural people ; they bartered
</p>
<p>the surplus products of their maize fields to sur-
</p>
<p>rounding tribes, usually receiving fish in exchange ;
</p>
<p>and this traffic was so considerable, that the Jesuits
</p>
<p>styled their country the Granary of the Algon-
</p>
<p>quins. 2
</p>
<p>Their prosperity was rudely broken by the
</p>
<p>hostilities of the Five Nations ; for though the con-
</p>
<p>flicting parties were not ill matched in point of
</p>
<p>numbers, yet the united counsels and ferocious

<p>asylum among the wastes which bordered on the
</p>
<p>north-eastern bands of the Dahcotah. Driven back

<p>by those fierce bison-hunters, they next established

<p>themselves about the outlet of Lake Superior, and
</p>
<p>the shores and islands in the northern parts of
</p>
<p>Lake Huron. Thence, about the year 1680, they
</p>
<p>descended to Detroit, where they formed a per

</p>
<p>valor, capacity, and address, they soon acquired an
</p>
<p>ascendency over the surrounding Algonquins.

</p>
<p>villages along the valley of the Lower Susque
</p>
<p>hanna ; while the Erigas, or Eries, occupied the
</p>
<p>borders of the lake which still retains their name.
</p>
<p>Of these two nations little is known, for the Jesuits
</p>
<p>had no missions among them, and few traces of
</p>
<p>them survive beyond their names and the record
</p>
<p>of their destruction. The war with the Wyandota
</p>
<p>was scarcely over, when the Five Nations turned
</p>
<p>their arms against their Erie brethren.
</p>
<p>In the year 1655, using their canoes as scaling
</p>
<p>ladders, they stormed the Erie stronghold, leaped
</p>
<p>down like tigers among the defenders, and butch-
</p>
<p>ered them without mercy. 1 The greater part of
</p>
<p>the nation was involved in the massacre, and the
</p>
<p>remnant was incorporated with the conquerors, or
</p>
<p>with other tribes, to which they fled for refuge.
</p>
<p>The ruin of the Andastes came next in turn ; but
</p>
<p>this brave people fought for twenty years against
</p>
<p>their inexorable assailants, and their destruction
</p>
<p>was not consummated until the year 1672, when
</p>
<p>they shared the fate of the rest. 2
</p>
<p>Thus, within less than a quarter of a century,
</p>
<p>four nations, the most brave and powerful of the
</p>
<p>North American savages, sank before the arms of
</p>
<p>the confederates. Nor did their triumphs end

<p>here. Within the same short space they subdued

<p>some reason to believe them Algonquins, and possibly identical with the

</p>
<p>In the years 1714-15, the confederacy received
</p>
<p>a great accession of strength. Southwards, about
</p>
<p>the headwaters of the rivers Neuse and Tar, and
</p>
<p>separated from their kindred tribes by intervening
</p>
<p>Algonquin communities, dwelt the Tuscaroras, a
</p>
<p>warlike people belonging to the generic stock of
</p>
<p>the Iroquois. The wrongs inflicted by white set-
</p>
<p>tlers, and their own undistinguishing vengeance,
</p>
<p>involved them in a war with the colonists, which
</p>
<p>resulted in their defeat and expulsion. They emi-
</p>
<p>grated to the Five Nations, whose allies they had
</p>
<p>been in former wars with southern tribes, and who
</p>
<p>now gladly received them, admitting them as a
</p>
<p>sixth nation, into their confederacy.
</p>
<p>It is a remark of Gallatin, that, in their career
</p>
<p>of conquest, the Five Nations encountered more
</p>
<p>stubborn resistance from the tribes of their own
</p>
<p>family, than from those of a different lineage. In
</p>
<p>truth, all the scions of this warlike stock seem
</p>
<p>endued with singular vitality and force, and among
</p>
<p>them we must seek for the best type of the Indian
</p>
<p>character. Few tribes could match them in prow-
</p>
<p>ess, constancy, moral energy, or intellectual vigor.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits remarked that they were more intelli-
</p>
<p>gent, yet less tractable, than other savages ; aud
</p>
<p>Charlevoix observes that, though the Algonquins
</p>
<p>were readily converted, they made but fickle prose-
</p>
<p>lytes ; while the Hurons, though not easily won
</p>
<p>over to the church, were far more faithful in their
</p>
<p>adherence. 1 Of this tribe, the Hurons or Wyan-

</p>
<p>Besides these inherent qualities, the tribes of the
</p>
<p>Iroquois race derived great advantages from their
</p>
<p>superior social organization. They were all, more
</p>
<p>or less, tillers of the soil, and were thus enabled
</p>
<p>to concentrate a more numerous population than
</p>
<p>the scattered tribes who live by the chase alone. In
</p>
<p>their well-peopled and well-constructed villages,
</p>
<p>they dwelt together the greater part of the year ;
</p>
<p>and thence the religious rites and social and po-
</p>
<p>litical usages, which elsewhere existed only in the
</p>
<p>germ, attained among them a full development.
</p>
<p>Yet these advantages were not without alloy, and

<p>Carolinas on the south ; from the Atlantic on the
</p>
<p>east to the Mississippi and Lake Winnipeg on the

<p>Carrier, as his ships ascended the St. Lawrence.
</p>
<p>The first British colonists found savages of the
</p>
<p>same race hunting and fishing along the coasts and
</p>
<p>inlets of Virginia ; and it was the daughter of an
</p>
<p>Algonquin chief who interceded with her father
</p>
<p>for the life of the adventurous Englishman. They
</p>
<p>were Algonquins who, under Sassacus the Pequot,
</p>
<p>and Philip of Mount Hope, waged war against
</p>
<p>the Puritans of New England ; who dwelt at
</p>
<p>Penacook, under the rule of the great magician,
</p>
<p>Passaconaway, and trembled before the evil spirits
</p>
<p>of the White Hills ; and who sang aves and told
</p>
<p>their beads in the forest chapel of Father Rasles,
</p>
<p>by the banks of the Kennebec. They were Algon-
</p>
<p>quins who, under the great tree at Kensington,
</p>
<p>made the covenant of peace with William Penn ;
</p>
<p>and when French Jesuits and fur-traders explored
</p>
<p>the Wabash and the Ohio, they found their va*
</p>
<p>leys tenanted by the same far-extended race. At
</p>
<p>the present day, the traveller, perchance, may find

<p>French the Loups, and by themselves Lenni Le

<p>nape, or Original Men, hold the first claim to
</p>
<p>attention ; for their traditions declare them to be
</p>
<p>the parent stem whence other Algonquin tribes have
</p>
<p>sprung. The latter recognized the claim, and, at
</p>
<p>all solemn councils, accorded to the ancestral tribe
</p>
<p>the title of Grandfather. 1
</p>
<p>The first European colonists found the conical
</p>
<p>lodges of the Lenape clustered in frequent groups
</p>
<p>about the waters of the Delaware and its tributary
</p>
<p>streams, within the present limits of New Jersey,
</p>
<p>and Eastern Pennsylvania. The nation was sepa-
</p>
<p>rated into three divisions, and three sachems formed
</p>
<p>a triumvirate, who. with the council of old men,
</p>
<p>regulated all its affairs. 2 They were, in some small
</p>
<p>measure, an agricultural people ; but fishing and
</p>
<p>the chase were their chief dependence, and through
</p>
<p>a great part of the year they were scattered abroad,
</p>
<p>among forests and streams, in search of sustenance.
</p>
<p>When William Penn held his far-famed council
</p>
<p>with the sachems of the Lenape, he extended the
</p>
<p>hand of brotherhood to a people as unwarlike in
</p>
<p>their habits as his own pacific followers. This is
</p>
<p>by no means to be ascribed to any inborn love of
</p>
<p>peace. The Lenape were then in a state of degrad
</p>
<p>ing vassalage to the Five Nations, who, that the)

</p>
<p>title of Uncles. They, in return, call the Lenape Nephews, or more fro

</p>
<p>and forego the use of arms. 1 Dwelling under the
</p>
<p>shadow of the tyrannical confederacy, they were
</p>
<p>long unable to wipe out the blot ; but at length,
</p>
<p>pushed from their ancient seats by the encroach-
</p>
<p>ments of white men, and removed westward, par-
</p>
<p>tially beyond the reach of their conquerors, theii
</p>
<p>native spirit began to revive, and they assumed a
</p>
<p>tone of defiance. During the Old French War
</p>
<p>they resumed the use of arms, and while the Five
</p>
<p>Nations fought for the English, they espoused the
</p>
<p>cause of France. At the opening of the Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion, they boldly asserted their freedom from the
</p>
<p>yoke of their conquerors ; and a few years after,
</p>
<p>the Five Nations confessed, at a public council, that
</p>
<p>the Lenape were no longer women, but men. 2
</p>
<p>Ever since that period, they have stood in high
</p>
<p>repute for bravery, generosity, and all the savage
</p>
<p>virtues ; and the settlers of the frontier have often
</p>
<p>found, to their cost, that the women of the Iroquois

<p>becoming embroiled with the Five Nations, they

<p>shared the defeat of the Andastes, and about the

<p>Of the tribes which, single and detached, or co-
</p>
<p>hering in loose confederacies, dwelt within the
</p>
<p>limits of Lower Canada, Acadia, and New England,
</p>
<p>it is needless to speak ; for they offered no distinc-
</p>
<p>tive traits demanding notice. Passing the country
</p>
<p>of the Lenape and the Shawanoes, and descending
</p>
<p>the Ohio, the traveller would have found its valley
</p>
<p>chiefly occupied by two nations, the Miamis or
</p>
<p>Twightwees, on the Wabash and its branches, and
</p>
<p>the Illinois, who dwelt in the neighborhood of the
</p>
<p>river to which they have given their name, while
</p>
<p>portions of them extended beyond the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>Though never subjugated, as were the Lenape, both
</p>
<p>the Miamis and the Illinois were reduced to the last

<p>extremity by the repeated attacks of the Five Na-

<p>of ten or twelve thousand, ascribed to them by the

<p>quarter of the eighteenth century, to a few small

<p>sunk in sloth and licentiousness ; but that priestly

<p>father had suffered much at their hands, and viewed

<p>them with a jaundiced eye. Their agriculture was

<p>not contemptible ; they had permanent dwellings

<p>Turning his course northward, traversing Lakes

<p>margin of Lake Huron, the voyager would have
</p>
<p>found the solitudes of the wild waste around him
</p>
<p>broken by scattered lodges of the Ojibwas, Potta

<p>have been welcomed by the rude hospitality of the

</p>
<p>have become broken into fragments, and indefi-
</p>
<p>nitely multiplied ; and many of the ancient customs
</p>
<p>of the institution are but loosely regarded. Agri-
</p>
<p>culture is little known, and, through summer and
</p>
<p>winter, they range the wilderness with restless wan-
</p>
<p>dering, now gorged to repletion, and now perishing
</p>
<p>with want. In the calm days of summer, the
</p>
<p>Ojibwa fisherman pushes out his birch canoe upon
</p>
<p>the great inland ocean of the north ; and, as he
</p>
<p>gazes down into the pellucid depths, he seems like
</p>
<p>one balanced between earth and sky. The watch-
</p>
<p>ful fish-hawk circles above his head ; and below,
</p>
<p>farther than his line will reach, he sees the trout
</p>
<p>glide shadowy and silent over the glimmering peb-
</p>
<p>bles. The little islands on the verge of the horizon
</p>
<p>seem now starting into spires, now melting from
</p>
<p>the sight, now shaping themselves into a thousand
</p>
<p>fantastic forms, with the strange , mirage of the
</p>
<p>waters ; and he fancies that the evil spirits of the
</p>
<p>lake lie basking their serpent forms on those unhal-
</p>
<p>lowed shores. Again, he explores the watery laby-
</p>
<p>rinths where the stream sweeps among pine-tufted
</p>
<p>islands, or runs, black and deep, beneath the shad-
</p>
<p>ows of moss-bearded firs ; or he drags his canoe
</p>
<p>upon the sandy beach, and, while his camp-fire
</p>
<p>crackles on the grass-plat, reclines beneath the
</p>
<p>trees, and smokes and laughs away the sultry hours,
</p>
<p>in a lazy luxury of enjoyment.

</p>
<p>backs, the Ojibwa family wander forth into the
</p>
<p>wilderness, cheered only on their dreary track by
</p>
<p>the whistling of the north wind, and the hungry
</p>
<p>howl of wolves. By the banks of some frozen
</p>
<p>stream, women and children, men and dogs, lie
</p>
<p>crouched together around the fire. They spread
</p>
<p>their benumbed fingers over the embers, while the
</p>
<p>wind shrieks through the fir-trees like the gale
</p>
<p>through the rigging of a frigate, and the narrow
</p>
<p>concave of the wigwam sparkles with the frost-
</p>
<p>work of their congealed breath. In vain they beat
</p>
<p>the magic drum, and call upon their guardian man-
</p>
<p>itoes ;  the wary moose keeps aloof, the bear lies
</p>
<p>close in his hollow tree, and famine stares them in
</p>
<p>the face. And now the hunter can fight no more
</p>
<p>against the nipping cold and blinding sleet. Stiff
</p>
<p>and stark, with haggard cheek and shrivelled lip,
</p>
<p>he lies among the snow drifts ; till, with tooth and
</p>
<p>claw, the famished wildcat strives in vain to pierce
</p>
<p>the frigid marble of his limbs. Such harsh school-
</p>
<p>ing is thrown away on the incorrigible mind of the
</p>
<p>northern Algonquin. He lives in misery, as his
</p>
<p>fathers lived before him. Still, in the brief hour

<p>of plenty he forgets the season of want ; and still

<p>the sleet and the snow r descend upon his houseless

<p>inent of the Algonquin tribes ; those whose strug
</p>
<p>gles and sufferings form the theme of the ensuing
</p>
<p>History. In speaking of the Iroquois, some of the
</p>
<p>distinctive peculiarities of the Algonquins have
</p>
<p>already been hinted at. It must be admitted that,
</p>
<p>m moral stability and intellectual vigor, they are
</p>
<p>inferior to the former ; though some of the most
</p>
<p>conspicuous offspring of the wilderness, Metacom,
</p>
<p>Tecumseh, and Pontiac himself, owned their blood
</p>
<p>and language.
</p>
<p>The fireside stories of every primitive people are
</p>
<p>faithful reflections of the form and coloring of the
</p>
<p>national mind ; and it is no proof of sound philos-
</p>
<p>ophy to turn with contempt from the study of a
</p>
<p>fairy tale. The legendary lore of the Iroquois,
</p>
<p>black as the midnight forests , awful in its gloomy
</p>
<p>strength, is but another manifestation of that spirit
</p>
<p>of mastery which uprooted whole tribes from the
</p>
<p>earth, and deluged the wilderness with blood. The
</p>
<p>traditionary tales of the Algonquins wear a differ

<p>not by downright force and cpen onset, but by sub-
</p>
<p>tle strategy, tricks, or magic art, achieved marvellous
</p>
<p>triumphs over the brute force of their assailants.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the tale will breathe a different spirit,
</p>
<p>and tell of orphan children abandoned in the heart
</p>
<p>of a hideous wilderness, beset with fiends and can*
</p>
<p>nibals. Some enamored maiden, scornful of earth
</p>
<p>ly suitors, plights her troth to the graceful manito
</p>
<p>of the grove ; or bright aerial beings, dwellers of
</p>
<p>the sky, descend to tantalize the gaze of mortals
</p>
<p>with evanescent forms of loveliness.
</p>
<p>The mighty giant, the God of the Thunder, who
</p>
<p>made his home among the caverns, beneath the cat-
</p>
<p>aract of Niagara, was a characteristic conception
</p>
<p>of Iroquois imagination. The Algonquins held a
</p>
<p>simpler faith, and maintained that the thunder was
</p>
<p>a bird who built his nest on the pinnacle of tow-
</p>
<p>ering mountains. Two daring boys once scaled the
</p>
<p>height, and thrust sticks into the eyes of the por-
</p>
<p>tentous nestlings ; which hereupon flashed forth
</p>
<p>such wrathful scintillations, that the sticks were
</p>
<p>shivered to atoms. 1
</p>
<p>1 For Algonquin legends, see Schoolcraft, in Algic Researches and
</p>
<p>Oneota. Le Jeune early discovered these legends among the tribes of his
</p>
<p>mission. Two centuries ago, among the Algonquins of Lower Canada, a
</p>
<p>tale was related to him, which, in its principal incidents, is identical with
</p>
<p>the story of the " Boy who set a Snare for the Sun," recently found by
</p>
<p>Mr. Schoolcraft among the tribes of the Upper Lakes. Compare Relation,
</p>
<p>1637, p. 172, and Oneota, p. 75. The coincidence affords a curious proof
</p>
<p>of the antiquity and wide diffusion of some of these tales.
</p>
<p>The Dacotah, as well as the Algonquins, believe that the thunder is
</p>
<p>produced by a bird. A beautiful illustration of this idea will be found in

</p>
<p>The religious belief of the Algonquins  and
</p>
<p>the remark holds good, not of the Algonquins only,
</p>
<p>but of all the hunting tribes of America is a
</p>
<p>cloudy bewilderment, where we seek in vain for
</p>
<p>system or coherency. Among a primitive and sav
</p>
<p>age people, there were no poets to vivify its images.
</p>
<p>and no priests to give distinctness and harmony to
</p>
<p>its rites and symbols. To the Indian mind, all
</p>
<p>nature was instinct with deity. A spirit was em-
</p>
<p>bodied in every mountain, lake, and cataract ; every
</p>
<p>bird, beast, or reptile, every tree, shrub, or grass-
</p>
<p>blade, was endued with mystic influence ; yet this
</p>
<p>untutored pantheism did not exclude the conception
</p>
<p>of certain divinities, of incongruous and ever shift-
</p>
<p>ing attributes. The sun, too, was a god, and the
</p>
<p>moon was a goddess. Conflicting powers of good
</p>
<p>and evil divided the universe : but if, before the
</p>
<p>arrival of Europeans, the Indian recognized the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of one, almighty, self-existent Being, the
</p>
<p>Great Spirit, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, the
</p>
<p>belief was so vague and dubious as scarcely to de
</p>
<p>serve the name. His perceptions of moral good
</p>
<p>and evil were perplexed and shadowy ; and the be-
</p>
<p>lief in a state of future reward and punishment
</p>
<p>was by no means universal. 1
</p>
<p>Of the Indian character, much has been written
</p>
<p>foolishly, and credulously believed. By the rha
</p>
<p>sodies of poets, the cant of sentimentalists, and the
</p>
<p>a quantity of snakes ; and the latter falling to the earth, caused the

</p>
<p>ter, a counterfeit image has been tricked out, which
</p>
<p>might seek in vain for its likeness through every
</p>
<p>corner of the habitable earth ; an imao-e bearing no
</p>
<p>more resemblance to its original, than the monarch
</p>
<p>of the tragedy and the hero of the epic poem bear
</p>
<p>to their living prototypes in the palace and the
</p>
<p>camp. The shadows of his wilderness home, and
</p>
<p>the darker mantle of his own inscrutable reserve,
</p>
<p>have made the Indian warrior a wonder and a mys-
</p>
<p>tery. Yet to the eye of rational observation there
</p>
<p>is nothing unintelligible in him. He is full, it is
</p>
<p>true, of contradiction. He deems himself the cen-
</p>
<p>tre of greatness and renown ; his pride is proof
</p>
<p>against the fiercest torments of fire and steel ; and
</p>
<p>yet the same man would beg for a dram of whiskey,
</p>
<p>or pick up a crust of bread thrown to him like a
</p>
<p>dog, from the tent door of the traveller. At one
</p>
<p>moment, he is wary and cautious to the verge of
</p>
<p>cowardice ; at the next, he abandons himself to a
</p>
<p>very insanity of recklessness ; and the habitual
</p>
<p>self-restraint which throws an impenetrable veil
</p>
<p>over emotion is joined to the unbridled passions of
</p>
<p>a madman or a beast.
</p>
<p>Such inconsistencies, strange as they seem in our
</p>
<p>eyes, when viewed under a novel aspect, are but the
</p>
<p>ordinary incidents of humanity. The qualities of

<p>ly awake. The conjunction of greatness and little-
</p>
<p>ness, meanness and pride, is older than the days of
</p>
<p>the patriarchs ; and such antiquated phenomena,
</p>
<p>displayed under a new form in the unreflecting, un-
</p>
<p>disciplined mind of a savage, call for no special
</p>
<p>wonder, but should rather be classed with the other
</p>
<p>enigmas of the fathomless human heart. The dis*
</p>
<p>secting knife of a Rochefoucault might lay bare
</p>
<p>matters of no less curious observation in the breast
</p>
<p>of every man.
</p>
<p>Nature has stamped the Indian with a hard and
</p>
<p>stern physiognomy. Ambition, revenge, envy, jeal-
</p>
<p>ousy, are his ruling passions ; and his cold temper-
</p>
<p>ament is little exposed to those effeminate vices
</p>
<p>which are the bane of milder races. With him
</p>
<p>revenge is an overpowering instinct ; nay, more, it
</p>
<p>is a point of honor and a duty. His pride sets all
</p>
<p>language at defiance. He loathes the thought of
</p>
<p>coercion ; and few of his race have ever stooped to
</p>
<p>discharge a menial office. A wild love of liberty,
</p>
<p>an utter intolerance of control, lie at the basis of
</p>
<p>his character, and fire his whole existence. Yet,
</p>
<p>in spite of this haughty independence, he is a de-
</p>
<p>vout hero-worshipper ; and high achievement in
</p>
<p>war or policy touches a chord to which his nature
</p>
<p>never fails to respond. He looks up with admiring
</p>
<p>reverence to the sages and heroes of his tribe ; and
</p>
<p>it is this principle, joined to the respect for age
</p>
<p>springing from the patriarchal element in his
</p>
<p>social system, which, beyond all others, contributes
</p>

<p>kindles into a burning passion ; and 10 allay its
</p>
<p>cravings, he will dare cold and famine, fire, tempest,
</p>
<p>torture, and death itself.
</p>
<p>These generous traits are overcast by much that
</p>
<p>Is dark, cold, and sinister, by sleepless distrust, and
</p>
<p>rankling jealousy. Treacherous himself, he is al-
</p>
<p>ways suspicious of treachery in others. Brave as
</p>
<p>he is,  and few of mankind are braver,  he will
</p>
<p>vent his passion by a secret stab rather than an
</p>
<p>open blow. His warfare is full of ambuscade and
</p>
<p>stratagem; and he never rushes into battle with
</p>
<p>that joyous self-abandonment, with which the war-
</p>
<p>riors of the Gothic races flung themselves into the
</p>
<p>ranks of their enemies. In his feasts and his drink-
</p>
<p>ing bouts we find none of that robust and full-toned
</p>
<p>mirth, which reigned at the rude carousals of our
</p>
<p>barbaric ancestry. He is never jovial in his cups,
</p>
<p>and maudlin sorrow or maniacal rage is the sole
</p>
<p>result of his potations.
</p>
<p>Over all emotion he throws the veil of an iron
</p>
<p>self-control, originating in a peculiar form of pride,
</p>
<p>and fostered by rigorous discipline from childhood
</p>
<p>upward. He is trained to conceal passion, and not
</p>
<p>to subdue it. The inscrutable warrior is aptly im-
</p>
<p>aged by the hackneyed figure of a volcano covered
</p>
<p>with snow ; and no man can say when or where the
</p>
<p>wild-fire will burst forth. This shallow self-mastery
</p>
<p>Berves to give dignity to public deliberation, and
</p>
<p>harmony to social life. Wrangling and quarrel are

<p>taken a lesson from the grave solemnity of an
</p>
<p>Indian council. In the midst of his family and
</p>
<p>friends, he hides affections, by nature none of the
</p>
<p>most tender, under a mask of icy coldness ; and
</p>
<p>in the torturing fires of his enemy, the haughty
</p>
<p>sufferer maintains to the last his look of grim
</p>
<p>defiance.
</p>
<p>His intellect is as peculiar as his moral organiza
</p>
<p>tion. Among all savages, the powers of perception
</p>
<p>preponderate over those of reason and analysis ;
</p>
<p>but this is more especially the case with the Indian.
</p>
<p>An acute judge of character, at least of such parts
</p>
<p>of it as his experience enables him to comprehend ;
</p>
<p>keen to a proverb in all exercises of war and the
</p>
<p>chase, he seldom traces effects to their causes, or
</p>
<p>follows out actions to their remote results. Though
</p>
<p>a close observer of external nature, he no sooner
</p>
<p>attempts to account for her phenomena than he in-
</p>
<p>volves himself in the most ridiculous absurdities;
</p>
<p>and quite content with these puerilities, he has not
</p>
<p>the least desire to push his inquiries further. His
</p>
<p>curiosity, abundantly active within its own narrow
</p>
<p>circle, is dead to all things else ; and to attempt
</p>
<p>rousing it from its torpor is but a bootless task. He
</p>
<p>seldom takes cognizance of general or abstract
</p>
<p>ideas ; and his language has scarcely the power to
</p>
<p>express them, except through the medium of fig-
</p>
<p>ures drawn from the external world, and often
</p>
<p>highly picturesque and forcible. The absence of

<p>reflection makes him grossly improvident, and unfits

</p>
<p>Some races of men seem moulded in wax, soft
</p>
<p>and melting, at once plastic and feeble. Some
</p>
<p>races, like some metals, combine the greatest flexi-
</p>
<p>bility with tlie greatest strength. But the Indian
</p>
<p>is hewn oat of a rock. You can rarely change the
</p>
<p>form without destruction of the substance. Races
</p>
<p>of inferior energy have possessed a power of ex pan
</p>
<p>sion and assimilation to which he is a stranger ;
</p>
<p>and it is this fixed and rigid quality which has
</p>
<p>proved his ruin. He will not learn the arts of civ-
</p>
<p>ilization, and he and his forest must perish together.
</p>
<p>The stern, unchanging features of his mind excite
</p>
<p>our admiration from their very immutability ; and
</p>
<p>we look with deep interest on the fate of this irre-
</p>
<p>claimable son of the wilderness, the child who
</p>
<p>will not be weaned from the breast of his rugged
</p>
<p>mother. And our interest increases when we dis-
</p>
<p>cern in the unhappy wanderer the germs of heroic
</p>
<p>virtues mingled among his vices,  a hand boun-
</p>
<p>tiful to bestow as it is rapacious to seize, and
</p>
<p>even in extremest famine, imparting its last morsel
</p>
<p>to a fellow-sufferer ; a heart which, strong in
</p>
<p>friendship as in hate, thinks it not too much to lay
</p>
<p>down life for its chosen comrade ; a soul true to
</p>
<p>its own idea of honor, and burning with an un-
</p>
<p>quenchable thirst for greatness and renown.

<p>The imprisoned lion in the showman's cage dif-

</p>
<p>FRANCE AND ENGLAND IN AMERICA
</p>
<p>The American colonies of France and England
</p>
<p>grew up to maturity under widely different auspices.
</p>
<p>Canada, the offspring of Church and State, nursed
</p>
<p>from infancy in the lap of power, its puny strength
</p>
<p>fed with artificial stimulants, its movements guided
</p>
<p>by rule and discipline, its limbs trained to martial
</p>
<p>exercise, languished, in spite of all, from the lack
</p>
<p>of vital sap and energy. The colonies of England,
</p>
<p>outcast and neglected, but strong in native vigoi
</p>
<p>and self-confiding courage, grew yet more strong
</p>
<p>with conflict and with striving, and developed the
</p>
<p>rugged proportions and unwieldy strength of a
</p>
<p>youthful giant.
</p>
<p>In the valley of the St. Lawrence, and along the
</p>
<p>coasts of the Atlantic, adverse principles contended
</p>
<p>for the mastery. Feudalism stood arrayed against
</p>
<p>Democracy ; Popery against Protestantism ; the
</p>
<p>sword against the plougshare. The priest, the
</p>
<p>soldier, and the noble, ruled in Canada, The
</p>
<p>ignorant, light-hearted Canadian peasant knew

</p>
<p>and civil liberties. Born to obey, he lived in con-
</p>
<p>tented submission, without the wish or the capacity
</p>
<p>for self-rule. Power, centered in the heart of the
</p>
<p>system, left the masses inert. The settlements
</p>
<p>along the margin of the St. Lawrence were like a
</p>
<p>camp, where an army lay at rest, ready for the
</p>
<p>march or the battle, and where war and adventure,
</p>
<p>not trade and tillage, seemed the chief aims of life.
</p>
<p>The lords of the soil were petty nobles, for the
</p>
<p>most part soldiers, or the sons of soldiers, proud
</p>
<p>and ostentatious, thriftless and poor ; and the peo-
</p>
<p>ple were their vassals. Over every cluster of small
</p>
<p>white houses glittered the sacred emblem of the
</p>
<p>cross. The church, the convent, and the roadside
</p>
<p>shrine were seen at every turn ; and in the towns
</p>
<p>and villages, one met each moment the black robe
</p>
<p>of the Jesuit, the gray garb of the Recollet, and
</p>
<p>the formal habit of the Ursuline nun. The names
</p>
<p>of saints, St. Joseph, St. Ignatius, St. Francis, were
</p>
<p>perpetuated in the capes, rivers, and islands, the
</p>
<p>forts and villages of the land ; and with every day,
</p>
<p>crowds of simple worshippers knelt in adoration
</p>
<p>before the countless altars of the Roman faith.
</p>
<p>If we search the world for the sharpest contrast
</p>
<p>to the spiritual and temporal vassalage of Canada,
</p>
<p>we shall find it among her immediate neighbors,
</p>
<p>the Puritans of New England, where the spirit of
</p>
<p>non-conformity was sublimed to a fiery essence ,
</p>
<p>and where the love of liberty and the hatred of
</p>
<p>power burned with sevenfold heat. The English
</p>

</p>
<p>erently to the law which he himself had made ;
</p>
<p>patient and laborious, and seeking for the solid
</p>
<p>comforts rather than the ornaments of life ; no
</p>
<p>lover of war, yet, if need were, fighting with a
</p>
<p>stubborn, indomitable courage, and then bending
</p>
<p>once more with steadfast energy to his form, or his
</p>
<p>merchandise,  such a man might well be deemed
</p>
<p>the very pith and marrow of a commonwealth.
</p>
<p>In every quality of efficiency and strength, the
</p>
<p>Canadian fell miserably below his rival ; but in all
</p>
<p>that pleases the eye and interests the imagination,
</p>
<p>he far surpassed him. Buoyant and gay, like his
</p>
<p>ancestry of France, he made the frozen wilderness
</p>
<p>ring with merriment, answered the surly howling
</p>
<p>of the pine forest with peals of laughter, and
</p>
<p>warmed with revelry the groaning ice of the St.
</p>
<p>Lawrence. Careless and thoughtless, he lived
</p>
<p>happy in the midst of poverty, content if he could
</p>
<p>but gain the means to fill his tobacco-pouch, and
</p>
<p>decorate the cap of his mistress with a ribbon.
</p>
<p>The example of a beggared nobility, who, proud
</p>
<p>and penniless, could only assert their rank by
</p>
<p>idleness and ostentation, was not lost upon him
</p>
<p>A rightful heir to French bravery and French rest-
</p>
<p>lessness, he had an eager love of wandering and
</p>
<p>adventure ; and this propensity found ample scope
</p>
<p>in the service of the fur- trade, the engrossing occu-
</p>
<p>pation and chief source of income to the colony.
</p>
<p>When the priest of St. Ann's had shrived him of
</p>
<p>his sins ; when, after the parting carousal, he em
</p>
<p>barked with his comrades in the deep-laden canoe ;

</p>
<p>of their song, and the blue, sunny bosom of the
</p>
<p>Ottawa opened before them ; when their frail bark
</p>
<p>quivered among the milky foam and black rocks
</p>
<p>of the rapid ; and when, around their camp-fire,
</p>
<p>they wasted half the night with jests and laughter, 
</p>
<p>then the Canadian was in his element. His foot-
</p>
<p>steps explored the farthest hiding-places of the
</p>
<p>wilderness. In the evening dance, his red cap
</p>
<p>mingled with the scalp-locks and feathers of the
</p>
<p>Indian braves ; or, stretched on a bear-skin by the
</p>
<p>side of his dusky mistress, he watched the gambols
</p>
<p>of his hybrid offspring, in happy oblivion of the
</p>
<p>partner whom he left unnumbered leagues behind.
</p>
<p>The fur-trade engendered a peculiar class of rest-
</p>
<p>less bush-rangers, more akin to Indians than to
</p>
<p>white men. Those who had once felt the fascina
</p>
<p>tions of the forest were unfitted ever after for a life
</p>
<p>of quiet labor ; and with this spirit the whole
</p>
<p>colony was infected. From this cause, no less than
</p>
<p>from occasional Avars with the English, and re-
</p>
<p>peated attacks of the Iroquois, the agriculture of
</p>
<p>the country was sunk to a low ebb ; while feudal
</p>
<p>exactions, a ruinous system of monopoly, and the
</p>
<p>intermeddlings of arbitrary power, cramped every
</p>
<p>branch of industry. 1 Yet, by the zeal of priests

</p>
<p>Feebly rooted in the soil, she thrust out brandies
</p>
<p>which overshadowed half America ; a magnificent
</p>
<p>object to the eye, but one which the first w] re-
</p>
<p>wind would prostrate in the dust.
</p>
<p>Such excursive enterprise was alien to the genius
</p>
<p>of the British colonies. Daring activity was rife
</p>
<p>among them, but it did not aim at the founding of
</p>
<p>military outposts and forest missions. By" the force
</p>
<p>of energetic industry, their population swelled with
</p>
<p>an unheard-of rapidity, their wealth increased in a
</p>
<p>yet greater ratio, and their promise of future great-
</p>
<p>ness opened with every advancing year. But it
</p>
<p>was a greatness rather of peace than of war. The
</p>
<p>free institutions, the independence of authority,
</p>
<p>which were the source of their increase, were ad-
</p>
<p>verse to that unity of counsel and promptitude of
</p>
<p>action which are the soul of war. It was far other-
</p>
<p>wise with their military rival. France had her
</p>
<p>Canadian forces well in hand. They had but one
</p>
<p>will, and that was the will of a mistress. Now
</p>
<p>here, now there, in sharp and rapid onset, they
</p>
<p>could assail the cumbrous masses and unwieldy
</p>
<p>strength of their antagonists, as the king-bird
</p>
<p>attacks the eagle, or the sword-fish the whale.
</p>
<p>Between two such combatants the strife must
</p>
<p>needs be a long one.
</p>
<p>Canada was a true child of the Church, baptized
</p>
<p>in infancy and faithful to the last. Champlain, the
</p>

<p>man and a soldier, was deeply imbued with fervid

<p>say, " is worth more than the conquest of an em-

</p>
<p>he brought with him four Franciscan monks from
</p>
<p>France. At a later period, the task of coloniza-
</p>
<p>tion would have been abandoned, but for the hope
</p>
<p>of casting the pure light of the faith over the
</p>
<p>gloomy wastes of heathendom. 2 All France was
</p>
<p>filled with the zeal of proselytism. Men and wo-
</p>
<p>men of exalted rank lent their countenance to the
</p>
<p>holy work. From many an altar daily petitions
</p>
<p>were offered for the well-being of the mission ;
</p>
<p>and in the Holy House of Mont-Martre, a nun lay
</p>
<p>prostrate day and night before the shrine, praying
</p>
<p>for the conversion of Canada. 3 In one convent,
</p>
<p>thirty nuns offered themselves for the labors of the
</p>
<p>wilderness ; and priests flocked in crowds to the
</p>
<p>colony. 4 The powers of darkness took alarm ; and
</p>
<p>when a ship, freighted with the apostles of the
</p>
<p>faith, was tempest-tost upon her voyage, the storm
</p>
<p>was ascribed to the malice of demons, trembling
</p>
<p>for the safety of their ancient empire.
</p>
<p>The general enthusiasm was not without its
</p>
<p>fruits. The Church could pay back with usury all
</p>
<p>that she received of aid and encouragement from
</p>
<p>the temporal power ; and the ambition of Riche-
</p>
<p>lieu could not have devised a more efficient
</p>
<p>enginery for the accomplishment of its schemes.

<p>cans, early laborers in the same barren field. In-

</p>
<p>holds of the Iroquois, like one who invades un-
</p>
<p>armed a den of angry tigers. Jesuit explorers

<p>traced the St. Lawrence to its source, and said

<p>masses among the solitudes of Lake Superior,
</p>
<p>where the boldest fur-trader scarcely dared to fol-

</p>
<p>The path of the missionary was a thorny and a

<p>bloody one ; and a life of weary apostleship was

<p>often crowned with a frightful martyrdom. Jean

</p>
<p>mained behind to aid the wounded and baptize the
</p>
<p>dying. Both were made captive, and both w r ere
</p>
<p>doomed to the fiery torture. Brebeuf, a veteran

<p>The slender frame of Lallemant, a man youngei

<p>in years and gentle in spirit, was enveloped in blaz
</p>
<p>ing savin-bark. Again and again the fire was extin-

<p>vied with each other in ingenious malignity. Re-

<p>deemed, at length, by the humane exertions of a

<p>our highest admiration ; but when we seek for the
</p>
<p>results of these toils and sacrifices, we shall seek
</p>
<p>in vain. Patience and zeal were thrown away upon
</p>
<p>lethargic minds and stubborn hearts. The reports
</p>
<p>of the Jesuits, it is true, display a copious list of
</p>
<p>conversions ; but the zealous fathers reckoned the
</p>
<p>number of conversions by the number of baptisms ;
</p>
<p>and, as Le Clercq observes, with no less truth than
</p>
<p>candor, an Indian would be baptized ten times a
</p>
<p>day for a pint of brandy or a pound of tobacco.
</p>
<p>Neither can more flattering conclusions be drawn
</p>
<p>from the alacrity which they showed to adorn their
</p>
<p>persons with crucifixes and medals. The glitter
</p>
<p>of the trinkets pleased the fancy of the warrior ;
</p>
<p>and, with the emblem of man's salvation pendent
</p>
<p>from his neck, he was often at heart as thorough a
</p>
<p>heathen as when he wore in its place a necklace
</p>
<p>made of the dried forefingers of his enemies. At

<p>While the church was reaping but a scanty har-

<p>was the precursor of military occupancy. In other

<p>ted. The influence which they often gained was
</p>
<p>exerted in behalf of the government under whose
</p>
<p>auspices their missions were carried on ; and they
</p>
<p>strenuously labored to win over the tribes to the
</p>
<p>French alliance, and alienate them from the heretic
</p>
<p>English. In all things they approved themselves
</p>
<p>the stanch and steadfast auxiliaries of the imperial
</p>
<p>power ; and the Marquis du Quesne observed of
</p>
<p>the missionary Picquet, that in his single person
</p>
<p>he was worth ten regiments. 1
</p>
<p>Among the English colonies, the pioneers of civ-
</p>
<p>ilization were for the most part rude, yet vigorous
</p>
<p>men, impelled to enterprise by native restlessness,
</p>
<p>or lured by the hope of gain. Their range was
</p>
<p>limited, and seldom extended far beyond the out-
</p>
<p>skirts of the settlements. With Canada it was far
</p>
<p>otherwise. There was no energy in the bulk of
</p>
<p>her people. The court and the army supplied the
</p>
<p>mainsprings of her vital action, and the hands
</p>
<p>which planted the lilies of France in the heart of
</p>
<p>the wilderness had never guided the ploughshare
</p>
<p>or wielded the spade. The love of adventure, the
</p>
<p>ambition of new discovery, the hope of military ad-

</p>
<p>ruling his little empire with absolute sway, en-
</p>
<p>forcing respect by his energy, but offending many
</p>
<p>by his rigor. Here he brooded upon the grand de-
</p>
<p>sign which had long engaged his thoughts. He
</p>
<p>had resolved to complete the achievement of Father
</p>
<p>Marquette, to trace the unknown Mississippi to its

<p>mouth, to plant the standard of his king in the

</p>
<p>early life had passed, it is said, in connection witl'
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, and his strong mind had hardened to
</p>
<p>iron under the discipline of that relentless school.
</p>
<p>To a sound judgment, and a penetrating sagacity,
</p>
<p>he joined a boundless enterprise and an adamantine
</p>
<p>constancy of purpose. But his nature was stern
</p>
<p>and austere ; he was prone to rule by fear rather
</p>
<p>than by love ; he took counsel of no man, and
</p>
<p>chilled all who approached him by his cold
</p>
<p>reserve.
</p>
<p>At the close of the year 1678, his preparations
</p>
<p>were complete, and he despatched his attendants to
</p>
<p>the banks of the liver Niagara, whither he soon
</p>
<p>followed in person. Here he began a little fort of
</p>
<p>palisades, and was the first military tenant of a spot
</p>
<p>destined to momentous consequence in future Avars.
</p>
<p>Two leagues above the cataract, on the eastern
</p>
<p>bank of the river, he built the first vessel which
</p>
<p>ever explored the waters of the upper lakes. 1 Her
</p>
<p>name was the Griffin, and her burden was forty
</p>
<p>five tons. On the seventh of August, 1679, she
</p>
<p>began her adventurous voyage amid the speechless
</p>
<p>wonder of the Indians, who stood amazed, alike at
</p>
<p>the unwonted size of the wooden canoe, at the flash
</p>
<p>and roar of the cannon from her decks, and at the
</p>
<p>carved figure of a griffin, which sat crouched
</p>
<p>upon her prow. She bore on her course along the
</p>
<p>virgin waters of Lake Erie, through the beautiful
</p>
<p>windings of the Detroit, and among the restless
</p>
<p>billows of Lake Huron, where a furious tempest

<p>had well nigh ingulphed her. La Salle pursued

</p>
<p>and after protracted suffering from famine and
</p>
<p>exposure reached its southern extremity on the
</p>
<p>eighteenth of October. 1
</p>
<p>He led his followers to the banks of the river
</p>
<p>now called the St. Joseph. Here, again, he built
</p>
<p>a fort ; and here, in after years, the Jesuits placed
</p>
<p>a mission and the government a garrison. Thence
</p>
<p>he pushed on into the unknown region of the Illi-
</p>
<p>nois ; and now dangers and difficulties began to
</p>
<p>thicken about him. Indians threatened hostility ;
</p>
<p>his men lost heart, clamored, grew mutinous, and
</p>
<p>repeatedly deserted ; and worse than all, nothing
</p>
<p>was heard of the vessel which had been sent back
</p>
<p>to Canada for necessary supplies. Weeks wore on,
</p>
<p>and doubt ripened into certainty. She had foun-
</p>
<p>dered among the storms of these wilderness oceans ;
</p>
<p>and her loss seemed to involve the ruin of the
</p>
<p>enterprise, since it was vain to proceed farther
</p>
<p>without the expected supplies. In this disastrous
</p>
<p>crisis, La Salle embraced a resolution character-
</p>
<p>istic of his intrepid temper. Leaving his men in
</p>
<p>charge of a subordinate at a fort which he had
</p>
<p>built on the river Illinois, he turned his face
</p>
<p>again towards Canada. He traversed on foot more
</p>
<p>than a thousand miles of frozen forest, crossing
</p>
<p>rivers, toiling through snow-drifts, wading ice-
</p>
<p>encumbered swamps, sustaining life by the fruits of
</p>
<p>the chase, and threatened day and night by lurking
</p>
<p>enemies. He gained his destination, but it was
</p>
<p>only to encounter a fresh storm of calamities. His
</p>
<p>enemies had been busy in his absence ; a malicious

<p>report had gone abroad that he was dead : his
</p>
<p>creditors had seized his property ; and the stores on
</p>
<p>which he most relied had been wrecked at sea, or
</p>
<p>lost among the rapids of the St. Lawrence. Still
</p>
<p>he battled against adversity with his wonted vigor,
</p>
<p>and in Connt Frontenac, the governor of the prov-
</p>
<p>ince,  a spirit kindred to his own,  he found a
</p>
<p>firm friend. Every difficulty gave way before him ;
</p>
<p>and with fresh supplies of men, stores, and ammu-
</p>
<p>nition, he again embarked for the Illinois. Hound
</p>
<p>ing the vast circuit of the lakes, he reached the
</p>
<p>mouth of the St. Joseph, and hastened with anxious
</p>
<p>speed to the fort where he had left his followers.
</p>
<p>The place was empty. Not a man remained.
</p>
<p>Terrified, despondent, mutinous, and embroiled in
</p>
<p>Indian wars, they had fled to seek peace and
</p>
<p>safety, he knew not whither.
</p>
<p>Once more the dauntless discoverer turned back
</p>
<p>towards Canada. Once more he stood before Count
</p>
<p>Frontenac, and once more bent all his resources
</p>
<p>and all his credit to gain means for the prosecution
</p>
<p>of his enterprise. He succeeded. With his little
</p>
<p>flotilla of canoes, he left his fort, at the outlet of
</p>
<p>Lake Ontario, and slowly retraced those interim
</p>
<p>nable waters, and lines of forest-bounded shore,
</p>
<p>which had grown drearily familiar to his eyes. Fate
</p>
<p>at length seemed tired of the conflict with so stub-
</p>
<p>born an adversary. All went prosperously with the
</p>
<p>voyagers. They passed the lakes in safety, crossed
</p>
<p>the rough portage to the waters of the Illinois, fol-
</p>
<p>lowed its winding channel, and descended the turbid

<p>banks. Now the waters grew bitter to the taste ;
</p>
<p>now the trampling of the surf was heard ; and now
</p>
<p>the broad ocean opened upon their sight, and their
</p>
<p>goal was won. On the ninth of April, 1682, with
</p>
<p>his followers under arms, amid the firing of mus-
</p>
<p>ketry, the chanting of the Te Deum, and shouts
</p>
<p>of " Vive le roi," La Salle took formal possession
</p>
<p>of the vast valley of the Mississippi, in the name of
</p>
<p>Louis the Great, King of France and Navarre. 1
</p>
<p>The first stage of his enterprise was accom-
</p>
<p>plished, but labors no less arduous remained behind.
</p>
<p>Repairing to the court of France, he was welcomed
</p>
<p>with richly merited favor, and soon set sail for
</p>
<p>the mouth of the Mississippi, with a squadron
</p>
<p>of vessels freighted with men and material for
</p>
<p>the projected colony. But the folly and obstinacy
</p>
<p>of a jealous naval commander blighted his fairest
</p>
<p>hopes. The squadron missed the mouth of the
</p>
<p>river; and the wreck of one of the vessels, and the
</p>
<p>desertion of the commander, completed the ruin of
</p>
<p>the expedition. La Salle landed with a band of half
</p>
<p>famished followers on the coast of Texas ; and,
</p>
<p>while he was toiling with untired energy for their
</p>
<p>relief, a few vindictive miscreants conspired against
</p>
<p>him, and a shot from a traitor's musket closed the
</p>
<p>career of the iron-hearted discoverer.
</p>
<p>It was left with another to complete the enter-
</p>
<p>prise on which he had staked his life ; and, in the
</p>
<p>year 1699, Lemoine dTberville planted the germ
</p>
<p>whence sprang the colony of Louisiana. 2

<p>Years passed on. In spite of a vicious plan of
</p>
<p>government, in spite of the bursting of the memora-
</p>
<p>ble Mississippi bubble, the new colony grew in wealth
</p>
<p>and strength. And now it remained for France to
</p>
<p>unite the two extremities of her broad American do-
</p>
<p>main, to extend forts and settlements across the fertile
</p>
<p>solitudes between the valley of the St. Lawrence and
</p>
<p>the mouth of the Mississippi, and intrench herself
</p>
<p>among the forests which lie west of the Allegha-
</p>
<p>nies, before the swelling tide of British colonization
</p>
<p>could overflow those mountain barriers. At the
</p>
<p>middle of the eighteenth century, her great project
</p>
<p>was fast advancing towards completion. The lakes
</p>
<p>and streams, the thoroughfares of the wilderness,
</p>
<p>were seized and guarded by a series of posts dis-
</p>
<p>tributed with admirable skill. A fort on the strait
</p>
<p>of Niagara commanded the great entrance to the
</p>
<p>whole interior country. Another at Detroit con-
</p>
<p>trolled the passage from Lake Erie to the north.
</p>
<p>Another at St. Mary's debarred all hostile access to
</p>
<p>Lake Superior. Another at Michillimackinac
</p>
<p>secured the mouth of Lake Michigan. A post at
</p>
<p>Green Bay, and one at St. Joseph, guarded the
</p>
<p>two routes to the Mississippi, by way of the rivers
</p>
<p>Wisconsin and Illinois ; while two posts on the
</p>
<p>NY abash, and one on the Maumee, made France
</p>
<p>the mistress of the great trading highway from
</p>
<p>Lake Erie to the Ohio. At Kaskaskia, Cahokia,

<p>and elsewhere in the Illinois, little French settle-
</p>
<p>ments had sprung up ; and as the canoe of the

<p>voyager descended the Mississippi, he saw, at rare

<p>one would have found a little cluster of Canadian

<p>dwellings, whose tenants lived under the protection
</p>
<p>of the garrison, and obeyed the arbitrary will of
</p>
<p>the commandant ; an authority which, however.
</p>
<p>was seldom exerted in a despotic spirit. In these
</p>
<p>detached settlements, there was no principle of
</p>
<p>increase. The character of the people, and of
</p>
<p>the government which ruled them, were alike
</p>
<p>unfavorable to it. Agriculture was neglected for
</p>
<p>the more congenial pursuits of the fur-trade, and
</p>
<p>the restless, roving Canadians, scattered abroad on
</p>
<p>their wild vocation, allied themselves to Indian
</p>
<p>women, and filled the woods with a mongrel race

<p>of bush-rangers.

<p>collision was at hand.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>1608-1763.
</p>
<p>THE FRENCH, THE ENGLISH, AND THE INDIANS.
</p>
<p>The French colonists of Canada held, from the
</p>
<p>beginning, a peculiar intimacy of relation with the
</p>
<p>Indian tribes. With the English colonists it was
</p>
<p>far otherwise ; and the difference sprang fronT
</p>
<p>several causes. The fur-trade was the life of Can-
</p>
<p>ada ; agriculture and commerce were the chief
</p>
<p>sources of wealth to the British provinces. The
</p>
<p>Romish zealots of Canada burned for the conver-
</p>
<p>sion of the heathen ; their heretic rivals were fired
</p>
<p>with no such ardor. And finally while the ambi
</p>
<p>tion of France grasped at empire over the farthest
</p>
<p>deserts of the west, the steady industry of the Eng
</p>
<p>lish colonists was contented to cultivate and improve
</p>
<p>a narrow strip of seaboard. Thus it happened that
</p>
<p>the farmer of Massachusetts and the Virginian
</p>
<p>planter were conversant with only a few bordering
</p>
<p>tribes, while the priests and emissaries of France
</p>
<p>were roaming the prairies with the buffalo-hunting
</p>
<p>Pawnees, or lodging in the winter cabins of the
</p>
<p>Dahcotah ; and swarms of savages, whose uncouth

<p>names were strange to English ears, descended

</p>
<p>yearly from the north, to bring their beaver and
</p>
<p>otter skins to the market of Montreal.
</p>
<p>The position of Canada invited intercourse with
</p>
<p>the interior, and eminently favored her schemes of
</p>
<p>commerce and policy. The river St. Lawrence,
</p>
<p>and the chain of the great lakes, opened a vast
</p>
<p>extent of inland navigation ; while their tributary
</p>
<p>streams, interlocking with the branches of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, afforded ready access to that mighty
</p>
<p>river, and gave the restless voyager free range
</p>
<p>over half the continent. But these advantages
</p>
<p>were well nigh neutralized. Nature opened the
</p>
<p>way, but a watchful and terrible enemy guarded the
</p>
<p>portal. The forests south of Lake Ontario gave
</p>
<p>harborage to the five tribes of the Iroquois, impla-
</p>
<p>cable foes of Canada. They waylaid her trading
</p>
<p>parties, routed her soldiers, murdered her mission-
</p>
<p>aries, and spread havoc and woe through all her
</p>
<p>settlements.
</p>
<p>It was an evil hour for Canada, when, on the
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth of May, 1609, 1 Samuel de Champlain
</p>
<p>impelled by his own adventurous spirit, departed
</p>
<p>from the hamlet of Quebec to follow a war-party
</p>
<p>of Algonquins against their hated enemy, the Iro-
</p>
<p>quois. Ascending the Sorel, and passing the rapids
</p>
<p>at Chambly, he embarKed on the lake which bears
</p>
<p>his name, and with two French attendants, steered
</p>
<p>southward, with his savage associates, toward the
</p>
<p>rocky promontory of Ticonderoga. They moved
</p>
<p>with all the precaution of Indian warfare ; when,

</p>
<p>at length as night was closing in, they descried a
</p>
<p>band of the Iroquois in their large canoes of elm
</p>
<p>hark approaching through the gloom. Wild yells
</p>
<p>from either side announced the mutual discovery.
</p>
<p>The Iroquois hastened to the shore, and all night
</p>
<p>long the forest resounded with their discordant war-
</p>
<p>songs and fierce whoops of defiance. Day dawned,
</p>
<p>and the fight began. Bounding from tree to tree,
</p>
<p>the Iroquois pressed forward to the attack ; but
</p>
<p>when Champlain advanced from among the Algon-
</p>
<p>quins, and stood full in sight before them, with his
</p>
<p>strange attire, his shining breastplate, and features
</p>
<p>unlike their own,  when they saw the flash of his
</p>
<p>arquebuse, and beheld two of their chiefs fall dead,
</p>
<p> they could not contain their terror, but fled for
</p>
<p>shelter into the depths of the wood. The Algon-
</p>

<p>victory was complete.
</p>
<p>Such was the first collision between the white
</p>
<p>men and the Iroquois ; and Champlain flattered
</p>
<p>himself that the latter had learned for the future
</p>
<p>to respect the arms of France. He was fatally
</p>
<p>deceived. The Iroquois recovered from theit
</p>
<p>terrors, but they never forgave the injury ; and yet
</p>
<p>if would be unjust to charge upon Champlain the
</p>
<p>origin of the desolating wars which were soon to
</p>
<p>scourge the colony. The Indians of Canada, friends
</p>
<p>and neighbors of the French, had long been har
</p>
<p>assed by inroads of the fierce confederates, and
</p>
<p>under any circumstances the French must soon
</p>
<p>have become parties to the quarrel.

</p>
<p>was fruitful of misery to the youthful colony
</p>
<p>The passes were beset by ambushed war-parties.
</p>
<p>The routes between Quebec and Montreal were
</p>
<p>watched with tiger-like vigilance. Bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>warriors prowled about the outskirts of the settle-
</p>
<p>ments. Again and again the miserable people,
</p>
<p>driven within the palisades of their forts, looked
</p>
<p>forth upon wasted harvests and blazing roofs. The
</p>
<p>Island of Montreal was swept with fire and steel.
</p>
<p>The fur-trade was interrupted, since for months
</p>
<p>together all communication was cut off with the
</p>
<p>friendly tribes of the west. Agriculture was
</p>
<p>checked ; the fields lay fallow, and frequent fam-
</p>
<p>ine was the necessary result. 1 The name of the
</p>
<p>Iroquois became a by-word of horror through the
</p>
<p>colony, and to the suffering Canadians they seemed
</p>
<p>troops of incarnate fiends. Eevolting rites and
</p>
<p>monstrous superstitions were imputed to them ;
</p>
<p>and, among the rest, it was currently believed that
</p>
<p>they cherished the custom of immolating young
</p>
<p>children, burning them, and drinking the ashes
</p>
<p>mixed with water to increase their bravery. 9 Yet
</p>
<p>the wildest imaginations could scarcely exceed the
</p>
<p>truth. At the attack of Montreal, they placed
</p>
<p>infants over the embers, and forced the wretched
</p>
<p>mothers to turn the spit ; 3 and those who fell
</p>
<p>within their clutches endured torments too hideous
</p>
<p>for description. Their ferocity was equalled only
</p>
<p>by their courage and address.

</p>
<p>At intervals, the afflicted colony found respite
</p>
<p>from its sufferings ; and, through the efforts of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits, fair hopes began to rise of propitiating
</p>
<p>the terrible foe. At one time, the influence of the
</p>
<p>priests availed so far, that under their auspices a
</p>
<p>French colony was formed in the very heart of the
</p>
<p>Iroquois country ; but the settlers were soon forced
</p>
<p>to a precipitate flight, and the war broke out
</p>
<p>afresh. 1 The French, on their part, were not idle ;
</p>
<p>they faced their assailants with characteristic gal-
</p>
<p>lantry. Courcelles, Tracy, De la Barre, and De
</p>
<p>Nonville invaded by turns, with various success,
</p>
<p>the forest haunts of the confederates ; and at
</p>
<p>length, in the year 1696, the veteran Count Fron-
</p>
<p>tenac marched upon their cantons with all the
</p>
<p>force of Canada. Stemming the surges of La Chine,
</p>
<p>gliding through the romantic channels of the
</p>
<p>Thousand Islands, and over the glimmering surface
</p>
<p>of Lake Ontario, and trailing in long array up the
</p>
<p>current of the Oswego, they disembarked on the
</p>
<p>margin of the Lake of Onondaga ; and, startling
</p>
<p>the woodland echoes with the clangor of their
</p>
<p>trumpets, urged their march through the mazes of
</p>
<p>the forest. Never had those solitudes beheld so
</p>
<p>strange a pageantry. The Indian allies, naked to
</p>
<p>the waist and horribly painted, adorned with
</p>
<p>streaming scalp-locks and fluttering plumes : stole
</p>
<p>crouching among the thickets, or peered with
</p>
<p>lynx-eyed vision through the labyrinths of foliage.

<p>sinewy, and strong, arrayed in wild costume of
</p>
<p>beaded moccason, scarlet leggin, and frock of buck-
</p>
<p>skin, fantastically garnished with many-colored
</p>
<p>embroidery of porcupine. Then came the levies
</p>
<p>of the colony, in gray capotes and gaudy sashes ,
</p>
<p>and the trained battalions from old France in
</p>
<p>cuirass and head-piece, veterans of European wars,
</p>
<p>Plumed cavaliers were there, who had followed
</p>
<p>the standards of Conde or Turenne, and who, even
</p>
<p>in the depths of a wilderness, scorned to lay aside
</p>
<p>the martial foppery which bedecked the camp and
</p>
<p>court of Louis the Magnificent. The stern com
</p>
<p>mander was borne along upon a litter in the midst,
</p>
<p>his locks bleached with years, but his eye kindling
</p>
<p>with the quenchless fire which, like a furnace,

<p>burned hottest when its fuel was almost spent

<p>Thus, beneath the sepulchral arches of the forest,

<p>the aged nobleman advanced to wreak his ven-

<p>geance upon empty wigwams and deserted maize-

</p>
<p>Even the fierce courage of the Iroquois began to

<p>quail before these repeated attacks, while the grad-

<p>ual growth of the colony, and the arrival of troops
</p>
<p>from France, at length convinced them that they

<p>could not destroy Canada. With the opening of

</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in spite of every obstacle, the powei
</p>
<p>of France had rapidly extended its boundaries in
</p>
<p>the west. French influence diffused itself through
</p>
<p>a thousand channels, among distant tribes, hostile,
</p>
<p>for the most part, to the domineering Iroquois.
</p>
<p>Forts, mission-houses, and armed trading stations
</p>
<p>secured the principal passes. Traders, and cou-
</p>
<p>reurs de oois pushed their adventurous traffic into
</p>
<p>the wildest deserts ; and French guns and hatchets,
</p>
<p>French beads and cloth, French tobacco and
</p>
<p>brandy, were known from where the stunted Es-
</p>
<p>quimaux burrowed in their snow caves, to where
</p>
<p>the Camanches scoured the plains of the south with
</p>
<p>their banditti cavalry. Still this far-extended com-
</p>
<p>merce continued to advance westward. In 1738,
</p>
<p>La Verandye essayed to reach those mysterious
</p>
<p>mountains which, as the Indians alleged, lay be-
</p>
<p>yond the arid deserts of the Missouri and the Sas-
</p>
<p>katchewan. Indian hostility defeated his enterprise,
</p>
<p>but not before he had struck far out into these
</p>
<p>unknown wilds, and formed a line of trading posts,
</p>
<p>one of which, Fort de la Reine, was planted on
</p>
<p>the Assinniboin, a hundred leagues beyond Lake

<p>Winnipeg. At that early period, France left her

<p>footsteps upon the dreary wastes which even now

<p>have no other tenants than the Indian buffalo-

<p>the Iroquois, they attempted to open a traffic with
</p>
<p>the Algonquin tribes of the great lakes ; and in
</p>
<p>the year 1687, Major McGregory ascended with a
</p>
<p>boat load of goods to Lake Huron } where his
</p>
<p>appeal ance excited great commotion, and where
</p>
<p>he was seized and imprisoned by 'the French. 1
</p>
<p>From this time forward, the English fur-trade lan-
</p>
<p>guished, until the year 1725, when Governor
</p>
<p>Burnet, of New York, established a post on Lake
</p>
<p>Ontario, at the mouth of the river Oswego ;
</p>
<p>whither, lured by the cheapness and excellence
</p>
<p>of the English goods, crowds of savages soon con-
</p>
<p>gregated from every side, to the unspeakable
</p>
<p>annoyance of the French. 2 Meanwhile, a consid-
</p>
<p>erable commerce was springing up with the Cher-
</p>
<p>okees and other tribes of the south ; and during
</p>
<p>the first half of the century, the people of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania began to cross the Alleghanies, and carry
</p>
<p>on a lucrative traffic with the tribes of the Ohio.
</p>
<p>In 1749, La Jonquiere, the Governor of Canada,
</p>
<p>learned, to his great indignation, that several
</p>
<p>English traders had reached Sandusky, and were
</p>
<p>exerting a bad influence upon the Indians of that
</p>
<p>quarter ; 3 and two years later, he caused four of
</p>
<p>the intruders to be seized near the Ohio, and sent
</p>
<p>prisoners to Canada. 4
</p>
<p>These early efforts of the English, considerable
</p>
<p>as they were, can ill bear comparison with the
</p>
<p>vast extent of the French interior commerce. In

</p>
<p>respect also to missionary enterprise, and the polit-
</p>
<p>ical influence resulting from it, the French had
</p>
<p>every advantage over rivals whose zeal for conver-
</p>
<p>sion was neither kindled by fanaticism nor fostered
</p>
<p>by an ambitious government. Eliot labored within
</p>
<p>call of Boston, while the heroic Brebeuf faced the
</p>
<p>ghastly perils of the western wilderness ; and the
</p>
<p>wanderings of Brainerd sink into insignificance
</p>
<p>compared with those of the devoted Rasles. Yet,
</p>
<p>in judging the relative merits of the Romish and
</p>
<p>Protestant missionaries, it must not be forgotten
</p>
<p>that while the former contented themselves with
</p>
<p>sprinkling a few drops of water on the forehead
</p>
<p>of the proselyte, the latter sought to wean him
</p>
<p>from his barbarism and penetrate his savage heart
</p>
<p>with the truths of Christianity.
</p>
<p>In respect, also, to direct political influence, the
</p>
<p>advantage was wholly on the side of France. The
</p>
<p>English colonies, broken into separate governments,
</p>
<p>were incapable of exercising a vigorous and consist
</p>
<p>ent Indian policy ; and the measures of one gov-
</p>
<p>ernment often clashed with those of another. Even
</p>
<p>in the separate provinces, the popular nature of
</p>
<p>the constitution and the quarrels of governors and
</p>
<p>assemblies were unfavorable to efficient action ; and
</p>
<p>this was more especially the case in the province
</p>
<p>of New York, where the vicinity of the Iroquois
</p>
<p>rendered strenuous yet prudent measures of the
</p>
<p>utmost importance. The powerful confederates,
</p>
<p>hating the French with bitter enmity, naturally
</p>

<p>friendship. But, at the early periods of her history.
</p>
<p>the assembly of New York was made up in great
</p>
<p>measure of narrow-minded men, more eager to
</p>
<p>consult their own petty interests than to pursue
</p>
<p>any far-sighted scheme of public welfare. 1 Other
</p>
<p>causes conspired to injure the British interest in
</p>
<p>this quarter. The annual present sent from Eng-
</p>
<p>land to the Iroquois was often embezzled by corrupt
</p>
<p>governors or their favorites. 2 The proud chiefs
</p>
<p>were disgusted by the cold and haughty bearing of
</p>
<p>the English officials, and a pernicious custom pre-
</p>
<p>vailed of conducting Indian negotiations through
</p>
<p>the medium of the fur-traders, a class of men held
</p>
<p>in contempt by the Iroquois, and known among
</p>
<p>them by the significant title of " rum carriers." 3
</p>
<p>In short, through all the counsels of the province
</p>
<p>Indian affairs were grossly and madly neglected. 4

<p>With more or less emphasis, the same remark

<p>holds true of all the other English colonies. 5 With

<p>those of France, it was far otherwise ; and thia
</p>
<p>difference between the rival powers was naturally
</p>
<p>incident to their different forms of government, and
</p>
<p>different conditions of development. France labored
</p>
<p>with eager diligence to conciliate the Indians and
</p>
<p>win them to espouse her cause. Her agents were
</p>
<p>busy in every village, studying the language of the
</p>
<p>inmates, complying with their usages, flattering
</p>
<p>their prejudices, caressing them, cajoling them, and
</p>
<p>whispering friendly warnings in their ears against
</p>
<p>the wicked designs of the English. When a party
</p>
<p>of Indian chiefs visited a French fort, they were?
</p>
<p>greeted with the firing of cannon and rolling of
</p>
<p>drums ; they were regaled at the tables of the
</p>
<p>officers, and bribed with medals and decorations,
</p>
<p>scarlet uniforms and French flags. Far wiser than
</p>
<p>their rivals, the French never ruffled the self-com-
</p>
<p>placent dignity of their guests, never insulted their
</p>
<p>religious notions, nor ridiculed their ancient cus-
</p>
<p>toms. They met the savage half way, and showed
</p>
<p>an abundant readiness to mould their own features
</p>
<p>after his likeness. 1 Count Frontenac himself
</p>
<p>plumed and painted like an Indian chief, danced
</p>
<p>the war-dance and yelled the war-song at the camp
</p>
<p>fires of his delighted allies. It would have been
</p>
<p>well had the French been less exact in their imita-
</p>
<p>tions, for at times they copied their model with
</p>
<p>infamous fidelity, and fell into excesses scarcely cred-
</p>
<p>ible but for the concurrent testimony of their own
</p>
<p>writers. Frontenac caused an Iroquois prisoner to

<p>be burnt alive to strike terror into his countrymen :
</p>
<p>and Louvigny, French commandant at Mi chilli niac-
</p>
<p>kihac, in 1695, tortured an Iroquois ambassador to
</p>
<p>death, that he might break off a negotiation between
</p>
<p>that people and the Wyandots. 1 Nor are these
</p>
<p>the only well-attested instances of such execrable
</p>
<p>inhumanity. But if the French were guilty of
</p>
<p>these cruelties against their Indian enemies, they
</p>
<p>were no less guilty of unworthy compliance with
</p>
<p>the demands of their Indian friends, in cases where
</p>
<p>Christianity and civilization would have dictated a
</p>
<p>prompt refusal. Even Montcalm stained his bright
</p>
<p>name by abandoning the hapless defenders of
</p>
<p>Oswego and William Henry to the tender mercies
</p>
<p>of an Indian mob.
</p>
<p>In general, however, the Indian policy of the
</p>
<p>French cannot be charged with obsequiousness.
</p>
<p>Complaisance was tempered with dignity. At an
</p>
<p>early period, they discerned the peculiarities of the
</p>
<p>native character, and clearly saw that while on
</p>
<p>the one hand it was necessary to avoid giving
</p>
<p>oifence, it was not less necessary on the other to
</p>
<p>assume a bold demeanor and a show of power ; to
</p>
<p>caress with one hand, and grasp a drawn sword
</p>
<p>with the other. 2 Every crime against a Frenchman
</p>
<p>was promptly chastised by the sharp agency of
</p>
<p>military law ; while among the English, the offender

<p>could only be reached through the medium of the
</p>
<p>civil courts, whose delays, uncertainties and evasions
</p>
<p>excited the wonder and provoked the contempt of
</p>
<p>the Indians.
</p>
<p>It was by observance of the course indicated
</p>
<p>above, that the French were enabled to maintain
</p>
<p>themselves in small detached posts, far aloof from
</p>
<p>the parent colony, and environed by barbarous
</p>
<p>tribes where an English garrison would have been
</p>
<p>cut off in a twelvemonth. They professed to hold
</p>
<p>these posts, not in their own right, but purely
</p>
<p>through the grace and condescension of the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding savages ; and by this conciliating assurance
</p>
<p>they sought to make good their position, until, with
</p>
<p>their growing strength, conciliation should no more
</p>
<p>be needed.
</p>
<p>In its efforts to win the friendship and alliance
</p>
<p>of the Indian tribes, the French government found
</p>
<p>every advantage in the peculiar character of its
</p>
<p>subjects  that pliant and plastic temper which
</p>
<p>forms so marked a contrast to the stubborn spirit
</p>
<p>of the Englishman. From the beginning, the
</p>

<p>did not become French, but the French became
</p>
<p>savages. Hundreds betook themselves to the forest,
</p>
<p>never more to return. These outflowings of French
</p>
<p>civilization were merged in the waste of barbarism,
</p>
<p>as a river is lost in the sands of the desert. The

<p>bine among his Indian friends ; and, in a few
</p>
<p>generations, scarcely a tribe of the west was free
</p>
<p>from an infusion of Celtic blood. The French
</p>
<p>empire in America could exhibit among its subjects
</p>
<p>every shade of color from white to red. every gra-
</p>
<p>dation of culture from the highest civilization of
</p>
<p>Paris to the rudest barbarism of the wigwam.
</p>
<p>The fur- trade engendered a peculiar class of
</p>
<p>men, known by the appropriate name of bush-
</p>
<p>rangers, or coiweurs de bois, half-civilized vagrants,
</p>
<p>whose chief vocation was conducting the canoes of
</p>
<p>the traders along the lakes and rivers of the interioi ;
</p>
<p>many of them, however, shaking loose every tie of
</p>
<p>blood and kindred, identified themselves with the
</p>
<p>Indians, and sank into utter barbarism. In many

</p>
<p>wigwam. He lounged on a bear-skin while his
</p>
<p>squaw boiled his venison and lighted his pipe. In
</p>
<p>hunting, in dancing, in singing, in taking a scalp,
</p>
<p>he rivalled the genuine Indian. His mind was
</p>
<p>tinctured with the superstitions of the forest. lie

<p>had faith in the magic drum of the conjuror ; he
</p>
<p>was not sure that a thunder cloud could not be
</p>
<p>frightened away by whistling at it through the wing
</p>
<p>bone of an eagle ; he carried the tail of a rattle-
</p>
<p>snake in his bullet pouch by way of amulet ; and
</p>
<p>he placed implicit trust in his dreams. This class
</p>
<p>of men is not yet extinct. In the cheerless wilds
</p>
<p>beyond the northern lakes, or among the mountain
</p>
<p>solitudes of the distant west, they may still be
</p>
<p>found, unchanged in life and character since the
</p>
<p>day when Louis the Great claimed sovereignty over
</p>
<p>this desert empire.

<p>The borders of the English colonies displayed
</p>
<p>no such phenomena of mingling races ; for here a
</p>
<p>thorny and impracticable barrier divided the white
</p>
<p>man from the red. The English fur-traders, and
</p>
<p>the rude men in their employ, showed it is true
</p>
<p>an ample alacrity to fling orf the restraints of civil
</p>
<p>ization ; but though they became barbarians, they
</p>
<p>did not become Indians ; and scorn on the one side
</p>
<p>and hatred on the other still marked the intercourse
</p>
<p>of the hostile races. With the settlers of the
</p>
<p>frontier it was much the same. Rude, fierce and

<p>contemptuous, they daily encroached upon the

</p>
<p>native population shrank back from before the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish, as from before an advancing pestilence ; while,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, in the very heart of Canada,
</p>
<p>Indian communities sprang up, cherished by the
</p>
<p>government, and favored by the easy-tempered
</p>
<p>people. At Lorette, at Caughnawaga, at St. Fran-
</p>
<p>cis, and elsewhere within the province, large bands
</p>
<p>were gathered together, consisting in part of fugi-
</p>
<p>tives from the borders of the hated English, and
</p>
<p>aiding in time of war to swell the forces of the
</p>
<p>French in repeated forays against the settlements
</p>
<p>of New York and New England.
</p>
<p>There was one of the English provinces marked
</p>
<p>out from among the rest by the peculiar character
</p>
<p>of its founders, and by the course of conduct
</p>
<p>which was there pursued towards the Indian tribes.
</p>
<p>William Penn, his mind warmed with a broad
</p>
<p>philanthropy, and enlightened by liberal views of
</p>
<p>human government and human rights, planted on
</p>
<p>the banks of the Delaware the colony which, vivi-
</p>
<p>fied by the principles it embodied, grew into the
</p>
<p>great commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Penn's
</p>
<p>treatment of the Indians was equally prudent and
</p>
<p>humane, and its results were of high advantage
</p>
<p>to the colony ; but these results have been exag-
</p>
<p>gerated, and the treatment which produced them
</p>
<p>made the theme of inordinate praise. It required
</p>
<p>no great benevolence to urge the Quakers to deal
</p>
<p>kindly with their savage neighbors. They were
</p>
<p>bound in common sense to propitiate them ; since,

<p>to the tomahawk, or wielding the carnal weapon,
</p>
<p>in glaring defiance of their pacific principles. In
</p>
<p>paying the Indians for the lands which his colo-
</p>
<p>nists occupied,  a piece of justice which has been
</p>
<p>greeted with a general clamor of applause,  Penn,
</p>
<p>as he himself confesses, acted on the prudent coun-
</p>
<p>sel of Compton, Bishop of London. 1 Nor is there
</p>
<p>any truth in the representations of Raynal and
</p>
<p>other eulogists of the Quaker legislator, who hold
</p>
<p>him up to the world as the only European who
</p>
<p>ever acquired Indian lands by purchase, instead of
</p>
<p>seizing them by fraud or violence. The example
</p>
<p>of purchase had been set fifty years before by the
</p>
<p>Puritans of New England ; and several of the other
</p>
<p>colonies had more recently pursued the same just
</p>
<p>and prudent course. 2
</p>
<p>With regard to the alleged results of the pacific
</p>
<p>conduct of the Quakers, our admiration will dimin-
</p>
<p>ish on closely viewing the circumstances of the
</p>
<p>case. The position of the colony was a most for-
</p>
<p>tunate one. Had the Quakers planted their colony
</p>
<p>on the banks of the St. Lawrence, or among the
</p>
<p>warlike tribes of New England, their shaking of
</p>
<p>hands and assurances of tender regard would not

<p>long have availed to save them from the visitations
</p>
<p>of the scalping- knife. But the Delawares, the
</p>
<p>people on whose territory they had settled, were
</p>
<p>like themselves debarred the use of arms. The
</p>
<p>Iroquois had conquered them, disarmed them, and
</p>
<p>forced them to adopt the opprobrious name of
</p>
<p>women. The humble Delawares were but too
</p>
<p>happy to receive the hand extended to them, and
</p>
<p>dwell in friendship with their pacific neighbors ;
</p>
<p>since to have lifted the hatchet would have brought
</p>
<p>upon their heads the vengeance of their conquerors,
</p>
<p>whose good will Penn had taken pains to secure. 1
</p>
<p>The sons of Penn, his successors in the proprie-
</p>
<p>torship of the province, did not evince the same
</p>
<p>kindly feeling towards the Indians which had dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished their father. Earnest to acquire new
</p>
<p>lands, they commenced through their agents a
</p>
<p>series of unjust measures, which gradually alien-
</p>
<p>ated the Indians, and, after a peace of seventy
</p>
<p>years, produced a disastrous rupture. The Quaker
</p>
<p>population of the colony sympathized in the kind-
</p>
<p>ness which its founder had cherished towards the
</p>
<p>benighted race. This feeling was strengthened
</p>
<p>by years of friendly intercourse ; and except where
</p>
<p>private interest was concerned, the Quakers made
</p>
<p>good their reiterated professions of attachment.
</p>
<p>Kindness to the Indian was the glory of their sect.
</p>

<p>reenforced by the influence of party spirit. The

<p>ment on the one hand and French seduction on
</p>
<p>the other, the Indians began to assume a threaten-
</p>
<p>ing attitude towards the province ; and many
</p>
<p>voices urged the necessity of a resort to arms.
</p>
<p>This measure, repugnant alike to their pacific
</p>
<p>principles and to their love of the Indians, was
</p>
<p>strenuously opposed by the Quakers. Their affec-
</p>
<p>tion for the injured race was now inflamed into a
</p>
<p>sort of benevolent fanaticism. The more rabid of
</p>
<p>the sect would scarcely confess that an Indian
</p>
<p>could ever do wrong. In their view, he was al-
</p>
<p>ways sinned against, always the innocent victim of
</p>
<p>injury and abuse; and in the days of the fina*
</p>
<p>rupture, when the woods were full of furious war
</p>
<p>parties, and the German and Irish settlers on the
</p>
<p>frontier were butchered by hundreds ; when the

<p>western sky was darkened with the smoke of burn-
</p>
<p>ing settlements, and the wretched fugitives were
</p>
<p>flying in crowds across the Susquehanna, a large

<p>party among the Quakers, secure by their Phila-

<p>consisted in the fraudulent interpretation of Indian
</p>
<p>deeds of conveyance, and in the granting out of
</p>
<p>lands without any conveyance at all. The most
</p>
<p>notorious of these transactions, and the one most
</p>
<p>lamentable in its results, was commenced in the
</p>
<p>year 1737, and w r as known by the name of the
</p>
<p>walking purchase. An old, forgotten deed was
</p>
<p>raked out of the dust of the previous century ; a
</p>
<p>deed which was in itself of doubtful validity, and
</p>
<p>which had been virtually cancelled by a subsequent
</p>
<p>agreement. On this rotten title the proprietors
</p>
<p>laid claim to a valuable tract of land on the right
</p>
<p>bank of the Delaware. Its western boundary was
</p>
<p>to be defined by a line drawn from a certain point
</p>
<p>on Neshaminey Creek, in a north-westerly direction,
</p>
<p>as far as a man could walk in a day and a half.

<p>From the end of the walk, a line drawn eastward

<p>limit of the purchase. The proprietors sought out

<p>the most active men who could be heard of, and
</p>
<p>' put them in training for the walk ; at the same time
</p>
<p>laying out a smooth road along the intended course,
</p>
<p>that no obstructions might mar their speed. By
</p>
<p>this means an incredible distance was accomplished
</p>
<p>within the limited time. And now it only remained
</p>
<p>to adjust the northern boundary. Instead of run-
</p>
<p>ning the line directly to the Delaware, according
</p>
<p>to the evident meaning of the deed, the proprietors
</p>
<p>inclined it so far to the north as to form an acute
</p>
<p>angle with the river, and enclose many hundred
</p>
<p>thousand acres of valuable land, which would

<p>the Delaware, above Easton, and was then occupied
</p>
<p>by a powerful branch of the Delawares, who, to
</p>
<p>their amazement, now heard the summons to quit
</p>
<p>for ever their populous village and fields of half-
</p>
<p>grown maize. In rage and distress they refused
</p>
<p>to obey, and the proprietors were in a perplexing

<p>dilemma. Force was necessary ; but a Quaker
</p>
<p>legislature would never consent to fight, and espe-
</p>
<p>cially to fight against Indians. An expedient was
</p>
<p>hit upon, at once safe and effectual. The Iro-

<p>appeared at Philadelphia, and having been well

<p>bribed, and deceived by false accounts of the

<p>been ordered, to the Susquehanna, where some
</p>
<p>settled at Shamokin, and some at Wyoming. 1 From
</p>
<p>an early period, the Indians had been annoyed by
</p>
<p>the unlicensed intrusion of settlers upon their lands,
</p>
<p>and, in 1728, they had bitterly complained of the
</p>
<p>wrong. 2 The evil continued to increase. Man\
</p>
<p>families, chiefly German and Irish, began to cross
</p>
<p>the Susquehanna and build their cabins along the
</p>
<p>valleys of the Juniata and its tributary waters.' The
</p>
<p>Delawares sent frequent remonstrances from their
</p>
<p>new abodes, and the Iroquois themselves made
</p>
<p>angry complaints, declaring that the lands of the
</p>
<p>Juniata were theirs by right of conquest, and that
</p>
<p>they had given them to their cousins, the Delawares,
</p>
<p>for hunting-grounds. Some efforts at redress were
</p>
<p>made ; but the remedy proved ineffectual, and the
</p>
<p>discontent of the Indians increased with every year.
</p>
<p>The Shawanoes, with many of the Delawares,
</p>
<p>removed westward, where for a time they would
</p>
<p>be safe from intrusion ; and by the middle of the
</p>
<p>century, the Delaware tribe was separated into two
</p>
<p>divisions, one of which remained upon the Susque-
</p>
<p>hanna, while the other, in conjunction with the
</p>
<p>Shawanoes, dwelt on the waters of the Alleghany
</p>
<p>and the Muskingum.
</p>
<p>But now the French began to push their advanced
</p>
<p>posts into the valley of the Ohio. Unhappily for
</p>

<p>that tribes so long faithful to the English might
</p>
<p>soon be won over to the cause of France.
</p>
<p>While the English interests wore so inauspicious
</p>
<p>an aspect in this quarter, their prospects were not
</p>
<p>much better among the Iroquois. Since the peace
</p>
<p>of Utrecht, in 1713, these powerful tribes had so
</p>
<p>far forgotten their old malevolence against the
</p>
<p>French, that the latter were enabled to bring all
</p>
<p>their machinery of conciliation to bear upon them.
</p>
<p>They turned the opportunity to such good account,
</p>
<p>as not only to smooth away the asperity of the
</p>
<p>ancient grudge, but also to rouse in the minds of
</p>
<p>their former foes a growing jealousy against the
</p>
<p>English. Several accidental circumstances did
</p>
<p>much to aggravate this feeling. The Iroquois
</p>
<p>were in the habit of sending out frequent war-
</p>
<p>parties against their enemies, the Cherokees and
</p>
<p>Catawbas, who dwelt near the borders of Carolina
</p>
<p>and Virginia ; and in these forays the invaders
</p>
<p>often became so seriously embroiled with the white
</p>
<p>settlers, that sharp frays took place, and an open
</p>
<p>war seemed likely to ensue. 1
</p>
<p>It was with great difficulty that the irritation
</p>
<p>caused by these untoward accidents was allayed ;
</p>
<p>and even then enough remained in the neglect
</p>
<p>of governments, the insults of traders, and the
</p>
<p>haughty bearing of officials, to disgust the proud
</p>
<p>confederates with their English allies. In the war
</p>
<p>of 1745, they yielded but cold and doubtful aid ;
</p>
<p>and fears were entertained of their final estrange-

<p>merit. 1 This result became still more imminent,
</p>
<p>when, in the year 1749 r the French priest Picquet
</p>
<p>established his mission of La Presentation on the
</p>
<p>St. Lawrence, at the site of Ogdensburg. 2 This
</p>
<p>pious father, like the martial churchmen of an
</p>
<p>earlier day, deemed it no scandal to gird on earthly
</p>
<p>armor against the enemies of the faith. He built
</p>
<p>a fort and founded a settlement ; he mustered the
</p>
<p>Indians about him from far and near, organized
</p>
<p>their governments, and marshalled their war-parties.
</p>
<p>From the crenelled walls of his mission- house the
</p>
<p>warlike apostle could look forth upon a military
</p>
<p>colony of his own creating, upon farms and clear-
</p>
<p>ings, white Canadian cabins, and the bark lodges
</p>
<p>of Indian hordes which he had gathered under his
</p>
<p>protecting wing. A chief object of the settlement
</p>
<p>was to form a barrier against the English ; but the
</p>
<p>purpose dearest to the missionary's heart was to
</p>
<p>gain over the Iroquois to the side of France ; and
</p>
<p>in this he succeeded so well, that, as a writer of
</p>
<p>good authority declares, the number of their war
</p>
<p>riors within the circle of his influence surpassed
</p>
<p>the whole remaining force of the confederacy. 3
</p>
<p>Thoughtful men in the English colonies saw with
</p>
<p>anxiety the growing defection of the Iroquois, and
</p>
<p>dreaded lest, in the event of a war with France, her
</p>
<p>ancient foes might now be found her friends. But
</p>
<p>in this ominous conjuncture, one strong influence
</p>
<p>was at work to bind the confederates to their old

</p>
<p>so remarkable in his character, and so conspicuous
</p>
<p>an actor in the scenes of the ensuing history, as to
</p>
<p>demand at least some passing notice.
</p>
<p>About the year 1734, in consequence it is said
</p>
<p>of the hapless issue of a love affair, William John-
</p>
<p>son, a young Irishman, came over to America at
</p>
<p>the age of nineteen, where he assumed the charge
</p>
<p>of an extensive tract of wild land in the province
</p>
<p>of New York, belonging to his uncle, Admiral Sir
</p>
<p>Peter Warren. Settling in the valley of the Mo-
</p>
<p>hawk, he carried on a prosperous traffic with the
</p>
<p>Indians ; and while he rapidly rose to wealth, he
</p>
<p>gained, at the same time, an extraordinary influence
</p>
<p>over the neighboring Iroquois. As his resources
</p>
<p>increased, he built two mansions in the valley,
</p>
<p>known respectively by the names of Johnson Castle
</p>
<p>and Johnson Hall, the latter of which, a well-con-
</p>
<p>structed building of wood and stone, is still standing
</p>
<p>in the village of Johnstown. Johnson Castle was
</p>
<p>situated at some distance higher up the river. Both
</p>
<p>were fortified against attack, and the latter was
</p>
<p>surrounded with cabins built for the reception of
</p>
<p>the Indians, who often came in crowds to visit the
</p>
<p>proprietor, invading his dwelling at all unseasonable
</p>
<p>hours, loitering in the doorways, spreading their
</p>
<p>blankets in the passages, and infecting the air with
</p>
<p>the fumes of stale tobacco.
</p>
<p>Johnson supplied the place of his former love
</p>
<p>by a young Dutch damsel, who bore him several
</p>
<p>children ; and, in justice to them, he married

</p>
<p>whose black eyes and laughing face caught his
</p>
<p>fancy, as, fluttering with ribbons, she galloped past
</p>
<p>him at a muster of the Tryon county militia.
</p>
<p>Johnson's importance became so conspicuous,
</p>
<p>that when the French war broke out in 1755, he
</p>
<p>was made a major general ; and, soon after, the
</p>
<p>colonial troops under his command gained the
</p>
<p>battle of Lake George against the French forces
</p>
<p>of Baron Dieskau. For this success, for which
</p>
<p>however he was entitled to little credit, he was
</p>
<p>raised to the rank of baronet, and rewarded with a
</p>
<p>gift of five thousand pounds from the king. About
</p>
<p>this time, he was appointed superintendent of In-
</p>
<p>dian affairs for the northern tribes, a station in
</p>
<p>which he did signal service to the country. In
</p>
<p>1759, when General Prideaux was killed by the
</p>
<p>bursting of a cohorn in the trenches before Niag-
</p>
<p>ara, Johnson succeeded to his command, routed the
</p>
<p>French in another pitched battle, and soon raised
</p>
<p>the red cross of England on the ramparts of the
</p>
<p>tort. After the peace of 1763, he lived for many
</p>
<p>years at Johnson Hall, constantly enriched by the
</p>
<p>increasing value of his vast estate, and surrounded
</p>
<p>by a hardy Highland tenantry, devoted to his in-
</p>
<p>terests ; but when the tempest which had long
</p>
<p>been brewing seemed at length about to break, and
</p>
<p>signs of a speedy rupture with the mother country
</p>
<p>thickened with every day, he stood wavering in

</p>
<p>honors, and his reluctance to become the agent of
</p>
<p>a murderous Indian warfare against his country-
</p>
<p>men and friends. His final resolution was never
</p>
<p>taken. In the summer of 1774, he was attacked
</p>
<p>with a sudden illness, and died within a few hours,
</p>
<p>in the sixtieth year of his age, hurried to his
</p>
<p>grave by mental distress, or, as many believed, by
</p>
<p>the act of his own hand.
</p>
<p>Nature had well fitted him for the position in
</p>
<p>which his propitious stars had cast his lot. His
</p>
<p>person was tall, erect, and strong ; his features
</p>
<p>grave and manly. His direct and upright dealings,
</p>
<p>his courage, eloquence, and address, were sure pass-
</p>
<p>ports to favor in Indian eyes. He had a singular
</p>
<p>facility of adaptation. In the camp, or at the
</p>
<p>council-board, in spite of his defective education,
</p>
<p>he bore himself as became his station ; but at
</p>
<p>home he was seen drinking flip and smoking to-
</p>
<p>bacco with the Dutch boors, his neighbors, and
</p>
<p>talking of improvements or the price of beaver-
</p>
<p>skins ; while in the Indian villages he would feast
</p>
<p>on dog's flesh, dance with the warriors, and har-
</p>
<p>angue his attentive auditors with all the dignity of
</p>
<p>an Iroquois sachem. His temper was genial ; he
</p>
<p>encouraged rustic sports, and was respected and
</p>
<p>beloved alike by whites and Indians.
</p>
<p>His good qualities, however, were alloyed with
</p>
<p>serious defects. His mind was as coarse as it was
</p>
<p>vigorous ; he was vain of his rank and influence,
</p>
<p>and being quite free from any scruple of delicacy,
</p>
<p>he lost no opportunity of proclaiming them. His

</p>
<p>his own way, lie was never distinguished by an
</p>
<p>anxious solicitude for the rights of others. 1
</p>
<p>At the time of which we speak, his fortunes had
</p>
<p>not reached their zenith ; yet his influence was
</p>
<p>great; and during the war of 1745, when he held
</p>
<p>the chief control of Indian affairs in New York,
</p>
<p>it was exercised in a manner most beneficial to the
</p>
<p>province. After the peace of Aix la Chapelle, in
</p>
<p>1748, finding his measures ill supported, he threw
</p>
<p>up his office in disgust. Still his mere personal
</p>
<p>influence sufficed to embarrass the intrigues of
</p>
<p>the busy priest at La Presentation ; and a few
</p>
<p>years later, when the public exigency demanded
</p>
<p>his utmost efforts, he resumed, under better aus-
</p>
<p>pices, the official management of Indian affairs.
</p>
<p>And now, when the blindest could see that be
</p>
<p>tween the rival claimants to the soil of America
</p>
<p>nothing was left but the arbitration of the sword,
</p>
<p>no man friendly to the cause of England could ob-
</p>
<p>serve without alarm how France had strengthened
</p>
<p>herself in Indian alliances. The Iroquois, it is true,
</p>
<p>had not quite gone over to her side ; nor had the
</p>
<p>Delawares wholly forgotten their ancient league with
</p>
<p>William Penn. The Miamis, too, in the valley of
</p>
<p>the Ohio, had lately taken umbrage at the conduct
</p>
<p>of the French, and betrayed a leaning to the side of
</p>
<p>England, while several tribes of the south showed

<p>1700-1755.
</p>
<p>COLLISION OF THE RIVAL COLONIES.
</p>
<p>The people of the northern English colonies had
</p>
<p>learned to regard their Canadian neighbors with
</p>
<p>the bitterest enmity. With them, the very name
</p>
<p>of Canada called up horrible recollections and
</p>
<p>ghastly images : the midnight massacre of Schen-
</p>
<p>ectady, and the desolation of many a New Eng-
</p>
<p>land hamlet ; blazing dwellings and reeking scalps ;
</p>
<p>and children snatched from their mothers' arms, to
</p>
<p>be immured in convents and trained up in the
</p>
<p>abominations of Popery. To the sons of the Puri-
</p>
<p>tans, their enemy was doubly odious. They hated
</p>
<p>him as a Frenchman, and they hated him as a
</p>
<p>Papist. Hitherto he had waged his murderous
</p>
<p>warfare from a distance, wasting their settlements
</p>
<p>with rapid onsets, fierce and transient as a summer
</p>
<p>storm ; but now, with enterprising audacity, he was
</p>
<p>intrenching himself on their very borders. The
</p>
<p>English hunter, in the lonely wilderness of Ver-
</p>
<p>mont, as by the warm glow of sunset he piled the
</p>
<p>spruce boughs for his woodland bed, started as a

<p>deep, low sound struck faintly on his ear, the even-

<p>forest. The erection of this fort, better known
</p>
<p>among the English as Crown Point, was a piece of
</p>
<p>daring encroachment which justly kindled resent-
</p>
<p>ment in the northern colonies. But it was not here
</p>
<p>that the immediate occasion of a final rupture was
</p>
<p>to arise. By an article of the treaty of Utrecht,
</p>
<p>confirmed by that of Aix la Chapelle, Acadia had
</p>
<p>been ceded to England ; but scarcely was the latter
</p>
<p>treaty signed, when debates sprang up touching
</p>
<p>the limits of the ceded province. Commissioners
</p>
<p>were named on either side to adjust the disputed
</p>
<p>boundary; but the claims of the rival powers proved
</p>
<p>utterly irreconcilable, and all negotiation was
</p>
<p>fruitless. 1 Meantime, the French and English
</p>
<p>forces in Acadia began to assume a belligerent
</p>
<p>attitude, and indulge their ill blood in mutual ag-
</p>
<p>gression and reprisal. 2 But while this game was
</p>
<p>played on the coasts of the Atlantic, interests of
</p>
<p>far greater moment were at stake in the west.
</p>
<p>The people of the middle colonies, placed by
</p>
<p>their local position beyond reach of the French,
</p>
<p>had heard with great composure of the sufferings
</p>
<p>of their New England brethren, and felt little con-
</p>
<p>cern at a danger so doubtful and remote. There
</p>
<p>were those among them, however, who with greater
</p>
<p>foresight had been quick to perceive the ambitious
</p>
<p>projects of the rival nation ; and, as early as 1716,
</p>
<p>Spotswood, governor of Virginia, had urged the
</p>
<p>expediency of securing the valley of the Ohio by

<p>a series of forts and settlements. 1 His proposal
</p>
<p>was coldly received, and his plan fell to the
</p>
<p>ground. The time at length was come when the
</p>
<p>danger was approaching too near to be slighted
</p>
<p>longer. In 1748, an association, called the Ohio
</p>
<p>Company, was formed with the view of making
</p>
<p>settlements in the region beyond the Alleghanies ;
</p>
<p>and two years later, Gist, the company's surveyor,
</p>
<p>to the great disgust of the Indians, carried chain
</p>
<p>and compass down the Ohio as far as the falls at
</p>
<p>Louisville. 2 But so dilatory were the English, that
</p>
<p>before any effectual steps were taken, their agile
</p>
<p>enemies appeared upon the scene.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1753, the middle provinces
</p>
<p>were startled at the tidings that French troops had
</p>
<p>crossed Lake Erie, fortified themselves at the point
</p>
<p>of Presqu'-Isle, and pushed forward to the northern
</p>
<p>branches of the Ohio. 3 Upon this, Governor Din-
</p>
<p>widdie, of Virginia, resolved to despatch a message
</p>
<p>requiring their removal from territories which lie
</p>
<p>claimed as belonging to the British crown; and
</p>
<p>looking about him for the person best qualified to
</p>
<p>act as messenger, he made choice of George Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, a young man twenty-one years of age, adju-
</p>
<p>tant general of the Virginian militia.
</p>

</p>
<p>of December. On that day he reached Venango,
</p>
<p>an Indian town on the Alleghany, at the mouth of
</p>
<p>French Creek. Here was the advanced post of the
</p>
<p>French ; and here, amon^ the Indian log-cabins and
</p>
<p>huts of bark, he saw their flag flying above the
</p>
<p>house of an English trader, whom the military
</p>
<p>intruders had unceremoniously ejected. They gave
</p>
<p>the young envoy a hospitable reception, 1 and referred
</p>
<p>him to the commanding officer, whose headquarters
</p>
<p>were at Le Boeuf, a fort which they had just built
</p>
<p>on French Creek, some distance above Venango.
</p>
<p>Thither Washington repaired, and on his arrival
</p>
<p>was received with stately courtesy by the officer,
</p>
<p>Legardeur de St. Pierre, whom he describes as an
</p>
<p>elderly gentleman of very soldier-like appearance.
</p>
<p>To the message of Dinwiddie, St. Pierre replied
</p>
<p>that he would forward it to the governor general
</p>
<p>of Canada ; but that, in the mean time, his orders
</p>
<p>were to hold possession of the country, and this he
</p>
<p>should do to the best of his ability. With this

<p>answer Washington, through all the rigors of the

</p>
<p>complaisance. The wine, as they dosed themselves pretty plentifully
</p>
<p>with it, soon banished the restraint which at first appeared in their con-
</p>
<p>versation, and gave a license to their tongues to reveal their sentiments
</p>
<p>more treely. They told me that it was their absolute design to take pos-
</p>
<p>session of the Ohio, and by G  d they would do it; for that, although
</p>
<p>they were sensible the English could raise two men for their one, yet they
</p>
<p>knew their motions were too slow and dilatory to prevent any under-
</p>
<p>taking of theirs. They pretend to have an undoubted right to the river

<p>1754.] DEATH OF JUMOXVILLE 99
</p>
<p>midwinter forest, retraced his steps, with one attend-
</p>
<p>ant, to the English borders.
</p>
<p>With the first opening of spring, a newly raised
</p>
<p>company of Virginian backwoodsmen, under Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Trent, hastened across the mountains, and
</p>
<p>began to build a fort at the confluence of the
</p>
<p>Monongahela and Alleghany, where Pittsburg now
</p>
<p>stands ; when suddenly they found themselves
</p>
<p>invested by a host of French and Indians, who,
</p>
<p>with sixty bateaux and three hundred canoes, had
</p>
<p>descended from Le Bceuf and Venango. 1 The
</p>
<p>English were ordered to evacuate the spot ; and,
</p>
<p>being quite unable to resist, they obeyed the sum-
</p>
<p>mons, and withdrew in great discomfiture towards
</p>
<p>Virginia. Meanwhile Washington, with another
</p>
<p>party of backwoodsmen, was advancing from the
</p>
<p>borders ; and, hearing of Trent's disaster, he
</p>
<p>resolved to fortify himself on the Monongahela,
</p>
<p>and hold his ground, if possible, until fresh troops
</p>
<p>could arrive to support him. The French sent out
</p>
<p>a scouting party under M. Jumonville, with the
</p>
<p>design, probably, of watching his movements ; but,
</p>
<p>on a dark and stormy night, Washington surprised
</p>
<p>them, as they lay lurking in a rocky glen not far
</p>
<p>from his camp, killed the officer, and captured the
</p>
<p>whole detachment. 2 Learning that the French,
</p>
<p>enraged by this reverse, were about to attack him
</p>
<p>in great force, he thought it prudent to fall back,
</p>
<p>and retired accordingly to a spot called the Great

<p>Meadows, where he had before thrown up a slight
</p>
<p>intrenchment. Here he found himself assailed by
</p>
<p>nine hundred French and Indians, commanded by
</p>
<p>a brother of the slain Jumonville. From eleven in
</p>
<p>the morning till eight at night, the backwoodsmen,
</p>
<p>who were half famished from the failure of their
</p>
<p>stores, maintained a stubborn defence, some fight-
</p>
<p>ing within the intrenchment, and some on the plain
</p>
<p>without. In the evening, the French sounded a
</p>
<p>parley, and offered terms. They were accepted,
</p>
<p>and on the following day Washington and his men
</p>
<p>retired across the mountains, leaving the disputed
</p>
<p>territory in the hands of the French. 1
</p>
<p>While the rival nations were beginning to quarrel
</p>
<p>for a prize which belonged to neither of them, the
</p>
<p>unhappy Indians saw, with alarm and amazement,
</p>
<p>their lands becoming a bone of contention between
</p>
<p>rapacious strangers. The first appearance of the
</p>
<p>French on the Ohio excited the wildest fears in the
</p>
<p>tribes of that quarter, among whom were those
</p>
<p>who, disgusted by the encroachments of the Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvanians, had fled to these remote retreats to
</p>
<p>escape the intrusions of the white men. Scarcely
</p>
<p>was their fancied asylum gained, when they saw
</p>
<p>themselves invaded by a host of armed men from
</p>
<p>Canada. Thus placed between two fires, they knew
</p>
<p>not which way to turn. There was no union in
</p>
<p>their counsels, and they seemed like a mob of oewil-

<p>dered children. Their native jealousy was roused
</p>
<p>to its utmost pitch. Many of them thought that
</p>
<p>the two white nations had conspired to destroy
</p>
<p>them, and then divide their lands. " You and the
</p>
<p>French," said one of them, a few years afterwards,
</p>
<p>to an English emissary, Cw are like the two edges of
</p>
<p>a pair of shears, and we are the cloth which is cut
</p>
<p>to pieces between them." !
</p>
<p>The French labored hard to conciliate them, ply-
</p>
<p>ing them with gifts and flatteries, 2 and proclaiming
</p>
<p>themselves their champions against the English.
</p>
<p>At first, these arts seemed in vain, but their effect
</p>
<p>soon began to declare itself; and this effect was
</p>
<p>greatly increased by a singular piece of infatuation
</p>
<p>on the part of the proprietors of Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>During the summer of 1754, delegates of the sev-
</p>
<p>eral provinces met at Albany, to concert measures
</p>
<p>of defence in the war which now seemed inevitable.
</p>
<p>It was at this meeting that the memorable plan of
</p>
<p>a union of the colonies was brought forward ; a
</p>
<p>plan, the fate of which was curious and significant,
</p>
<p>for the crown rejected it as giving too much power

<p>to the people, and the people as giving too much

</p>
<p>the Iroquois, and though they were found but luke-
</p>
<p>warm in their attachment to the English, a treaty
</p>
<p>of friendship and alliance was concluded with their
</p>
<p>deputies. 2 It would have been well if the matter
</p>
<p>had ended here ; but, with ill-timed rapacity, the
</p>
<p>proprietary agents of Pennsylvania took advantage
</p>
<p>of this great assemblage of sachems to procure
</p>
<p>from them the grant of extensive tracts, including
</p>
<p>the lands inhabited by the very tribes whom the
</p>
<p>French were at that moment striving to seduce. 3
</p>
<p>When they heard that, without their consent, their
</p>
<p>conquerors and tyrants, the Iroquois, had sold the
</p>
<p>soil from beneath their feet, their indignation was
</p>
<p>extreme ; and, convinced that there was no limit to
</p>
<p>English encroachment, many of them from that
</p>
<p>hour became fast allies of the French.
</p>
<p>The courts of London and Versailles still main-
</p>
<p>tained a diplomatic intercourse, both protesting
</p>
<p>then* earnest wish that their conflicting claims might
</p>
<p>be adjusted by friendly negotiation ; but while each
</p>
<p>disclaimed the intention of hostility, both were
</p>
<p>hastening to prepare for war. Early in 1755, an
</p>
<p>English fleet sailed from Cork, having on board
</p>

<p>by General Braddock ; and soon after, a French

<p>boldness, for their neglect of the Indians, their invasion of their lands, and

<p>with munitions of war and a strong body of troops

</p>
<p>The English fleet gained its destination, and landed
</p>
<p>its troops in safety. The French were less fortu-
</p>
<p>nate. Two of their ships, the Lys and the Alcide,
</p>
<p>became involved in the fogs of the banks of New-
</p>
<p>foundland ; and when the weather cleared, they
</p>
<p>found themselves under the guns of a superior Brit-
</p>
<p>ish force, belonging to the squadron of Admiral
</p>
<p>Boscawen, sent out for the express purpose of
</p>
<p>intercepting them. " Are we at peace or war '{ "
</p>
<p>demanded the French commander. A broadside
</p>
<p>from the Englishman soon solved his doubts, and
</p>
<p>after a stout resistance the French struck their
</p>
<p>colors. 1 News of the capture caused great excite-
</p>
<p>ment in England, but the conduct of the aggres
</p>
<p>sors was generally approved ; and under pretence
</p>
<p>that the French had begun the war by their alleged
</p>
<p>encroachments in America, orders were issued for
</p>
<p>a general attack upon their marine. So successful
</p>
<p>were the British cruisers, that, before the end of
</p>
<p>the year, three hundred French vessels and nearly
</p>
<p>eight thousand sailors were captured and brought
</p>

</p>
<p>Thus began that memorable war which, kindling
</p>
<p>among the forests of xlmerica, scattered its fires
</p>
<p>over the kingdoms of Europe, and the sultry empire
</p>
<p>of the Great Mogul ; the war made glorious by
</p>
<p>the heroic death of Wolfe, the victories of Fred
</p>
<p>eric, and the exploits of Clive ; the war which
</p>
<p>controlled the destinies of America, and was lir'st
</p>
<p>in the chain of events which led on to her Revo-
</p>
<p>lution with all its vast and undeveloped conse
</p>
<p>quences. On the old battle-ground of Europe, the
</p>
<p>contest bore the same familiar features of violence
</p>
<p>and horror which had marked the strife of former
</p>
<p>generations  fields ploughed by the cannon ball,
</p>
<p>and walls shattered by the exploding mine, sacked
</p>
<p>towns and blazing suburbs, the lamentations of
</p>
<p>women, and the license of a maddened soldiery
</p>
<p>But in America, war assumed a new and striking
</p>
<p>aspect. A wilderness was its sublime arena. Army
</p>
<p>met army under the shadows of primeval woods ;
</p>
<p>their cannon resounded over wastes unknown to
</p>
<p>civilized man. And before the hostile powers
</p>
<p>could join in battle, endless forests must be trav-
</p>
<p>ersed, and morasses passed, and everywhere the
</p>
<p>axe of the pioneer must hew a path for the bayonet
</p>
<p>of the soldier.

</p>
<p>breaking off of negotiations between the courts of

</p>
<p>France and England, the English ministry formed
</p>
<p>the plan of assailing the French in America on all
</p>
<p>sides at once, and repelling them, by one bold push,
</p>
<p>from all their encroachments. 1 A provincial army
</p>
<p>was to advance upon Acadia, a second was to
</p>
<p>attack Crown Point, and a third Niagara ; while
</p>
<p>the two regiments which had lately arrived in Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia under General Braddock, aided by a strong
</p>
<p>body of provincials, were to dislodge the French
</p>
<p>from their newly-built fort of Du Quesne. To
</p>
<p>Braddock was assigned the chief command of all
</p>
<p>the British forces in America ; and a person worse
</p>
<p>fitted for the office could scarcely have been found.
</p>
<p>His experience had been ample, and none could
</p>
<p>doubt his courage ; but he was profligate, arro
</p>
<p>gant, perverse, and a bigot to military rules. 2 On
</p>
<p>1 Instructions of General Braddock. See Precis des Faits, 160, 168.
</p>
<p>2 The following is Horace Walpole's testimony, and writers of better
</p>
<p>authority have expressed themselves, with less liveliness ,nd piquancy,
</p>
<p>to the same effect : 
</p>
<p>" Braddock is a very Iroquois in disposition. He had a sister, who,
</p>
<p>having gamed away all her little fortune at Bath, hanged herself with a
</p>
<p>truly English deliberation, leaving only a note upon the table with those
</p>
<p>lines, ' To die is landing on some silent shore/ &c. When Braddock was
</p>
<p>told of it, he only said, ' Poor Fanny ! I always thought she would play
</p>
<p>till she would be forced to tuck herself up.' "
</p>
<p>Here follows a curious anecdote of Braddock' s meanness and profligacy,
</p>
<p>which I omit. The next is more to his credit. " He once had a duel with
</p>
<p>Colonel Gumley, Lady Bath's brother, who had been his great friend. As
</p>
<p>they were going to engage, Gumley, who had good humor and wit (Brad-
</p>
<p>dock had the latter), said, ' Braddock, you are a poor dog ! Here, take my
</p>
<p>purse. If you kill me, you will be forced to run away, and then you will
</p>
<p>not have a shilling to support you.' Braddock refused the purse, insisted
</p>
<p>on the duel, was disarmed, and would not even ask his life. However,

<p>his first arrival in Virginia, lie called together the
</p>
<p>governors of the several provinces, in order to
</p>
<p>explain his instructions and adjust the details of
</p>
<p>the projected operations. These arrangements
</p>
<p>complete, Braddock advanced to the borders of
</p>
<p>Virginia, and formed his camp at Fort Cumberland
</p>
<p>where he spent several weeks in training the raw
</p>
<p>backwoodsmen, who joined him, into such disci
</p>
<p>pline as they seemed capable of; in collecting
</p>
<p>horses and wagons, which could only be had with
</p>
<p>he utmost difficulty; in railing at the contractors,
</p>
<p>who scandalously cheated him ; and in venting his
</p>
<p>spleen by copious abuse of the country and the
</p>
<p>people. All at length was ready, and early in
</p>
<p>June, 1755, the army left civilization behind, and
</p>
<p>struck into the broad wilderness as a squadron puts
</p>
<p>out to sea.
</p>
<p>It was no easy task to force their way over that
</p>
<p>rugged ground, covered with an unbroken growth
</p>
<p>of forest ; and the difficulty was increased by the
</p>
<p>needless load of baggage which encumbered their
</p>
<p>march. The crash of falling trees resounded in
</p>
<p>the front, where a hundred axemen labored with
</p>
<p>ceaseless toil to hew a passage for the army. 1
</p>
<p>The horses strained their utmost strength to drag
</p>
<p>the ponderous wagons over roots and stumpSj
</p>
<p>through gullies and quagmires ; and the regular
</p>
<p>troops were daunted by the depth and gloom of
</p>
<p>the forest which hedged them in on either hand,
</p>
<p>and closed its leafy arches above their heads. So

<p>tedious was their progress, that, by the advice of

</p>
<p>Washington, twelve hundred chosen men moved
</p>
<p>on in advance with the lighter baggage and artil-
</p>
<p>lery, leaving the rest of the army to follow, by
</p>
<p>slower stages, with the heavy wagons. On the
</p>
<p>eighth of July, the advanced body reached the
</p>
<p>Monongahela, at a point not far distant from Fort
</p>
<p>du Quesne. The rocky and impracticable ground
</p>
<p>on the eastern side debarred their passage, and the
</p>
<p>general resolved to cross the river in search of a
</p>
<p>smoother path, and recross it a few miles lower
</p>
<p>down, in order to gain the fort. The first passage
</p>
<p>was easily made, and the troops moved, in glitter-
</p>
<p>ing array, down the western margin of the water,
</p>
<p>rejoicing that their goal was well nigh reached,
</p>
<p>and the hour of their expected triumph close at
</p>
<p>hand.
</p>
<p>Scouts and Indian runners had brought the tid 
</p>
<p>ings of Braddock's approach to the French at Fort
</p>
<p>du Quesne. Their dismay was great, and Contre
</p>
<p>cceur, the commander, thought only of retreat
</p>
<p>when Beaujeu, a captain in the garrison, made the
</p>
<p>bold proposal of leading out a party of French
</p>
<p>and Indians to waylay the English in the woods,
</p>
<p>and harass or interrupt their march. The offer
</p>
<p>was accepted, and Beaujeu hastened to the Indian
</p>
<p>camps.
</p>
<p>Around the fort and beneath the adjacent forest
</p>
<p>were the bark lodges of savage hordes, whom the
</p>
<p>French had mustered from far and near ; Ojibwas

<p>and Ottawas, Hurons and Caughnawagas, Abena-

</p>
<p>them, and invited them to follow him out to battle ;
</p>
<p>but the boldest stood aghast at the peril, and none
</p>
<p>would accept the challenge. A second interview
</p>
<p>took place with no better success ; but the French-
</p>
<p>man was resolved to carry his point. " I am de-
</p>
<p>termined to go," he exclaimed. " What, will you
</p>
<p>suffer your father to go alone ? " ! His daring
</p>
<p>proved contagious. The warriors hesitated no
</p>
<p>longer ; and when, on the morning of the ninth
</p>
<p>of July, a scout ran in with the news that the
</p>
<p>English army was but a few miles distant, the In-
</p>
<p>dian camps were at once astir with the turmoil of
</p>
<p>preparation. Chiefs harangued their yelling fol-
</p>
<p>lowers, braves bedaubed themselves with war-paint,
</p>
<p>smeared themselves with grease, hung feathers in
</p>
<p>their scalp-locks, and whooped and stamped till
</p>
<p>they had wrought themselves into a delirium of
</p>
<p>valor.
</p>
<p>That morning, James Smith, an English prisoner
</p>
<p>recently captured on the frontier of Pennsylvania,
</p>
<p>stood on the rampart, and saw the half-frenzied
</p>
<p>multitude thronging about the gateway, where kegs
</p>

</p>
<p>There were the Ottawas, led on, it is said, by the
</p>
<p>remarkable man whose name stands on the title-
</p>
<p>page of this history ; there were the Hurons of
</p>
<p>Lorette under their chief, whom the French called
</p>
<p>Athanase, 1 and many more, all keen as hounds on
</p>
<p>the scent of blood. At about nine miles from the
</p>
<p>fort, they reached a spot where the narrow road
</p>
<p>descended to the river through deep and gloomy
</p>
<p>woods, and where two ravines, concealed by trees
</p>
<p>and bushes, seemed formed by nature for an am-
</p>
<p>buscade. Beaujeau well knew the ground ; and it
</p>
<p>was here that he had resolved to fight ; but he and
</p>
<p>his followers were well nigh too late ; for as they
</p>
<p>neared the ravines, the woods were resounding
</p>
<p>with the roll of the British drums.
</p>
<p>It was past noon of a day brightened with the
</p>
<p>clear sunlight of an American midsummer, when
</p>
<p>the forces of Braddock began, for a second time,
</p>
<p>to cross the Monongahela, at the fording-place,
</p>
<p>which to this day bears the name of their ill-fated
</p>
<p>leader. The scarlet columns of the British regu
</p>
<p>lars, complete in martial appointment, the rude
</p>
<p>backwoodsmen with shouldered rifles, the trains of
</p>
<p>artillery and the white-topped wagons, moved on
</p>
<p>in long procession through the shallow current,
</p>
<p>and slowly mounted the opposing bank. 1 Men

<p> George Washington, a boy in years, a man in

<p>calm thought and self-ruling wisdom.
</p>
<p>With steady and well ordered march, the troops
</p>
<p>advanced into the great labyrinth of woods which
</p>
<p>shadowed the eastern borders of the river. Eank
</p>
<p>after rank vanished from sight. The forest swal-
</p>
<p>lowed them up, and the silence of the wilderness
</p>
<p>sank down once more on the shores and waters of
</p>
<p>the Monongahela.
</p>
<p>Several engineers and guides and six light horse
</p>
<p>men led the way ; a body of grenadiers under Gage
</p>
<p>was close behind, and the army followed in such
</p>
<p>order as the rough ground would permit, along a
</p>
<p>narrow road, twelve feet wide, tunnelled through
</p>
<p>the dense and matted foliage. There were flank-
</p>
<p>ing parties on either side, but no scouts to scour
</p>
<p>the woods in front, and with an insane confidence
</p>
<p>Braddock pressed on to meet his fate. The van
</p>
<p>had passed the low grounds that bordered the river,
</p>
<p>and were now ascending a gently rising ground,
</p>
<p>where, on either hand, hidden by thick trees, by
</p>
<p>out the ford where the army crossed the Monongahela (below Turtle
</p>
<p>Creek, 800 yards). A finer sight could not have been beheld,  the
</p>
<p>shining barrels of the muskets, the excellent order of the men, the clean-

<p>tangled undergrowth, and rank grasses, lay the two
</p>
<p>fatal ravines. Suddenly, Gordon, an engineer in
</p>
<p>advance, saw the French and Indians bounding
</p>
<p>forward through the forest and along the narrow
</p>
<p>track, Beaujeau leading them on, dressed in a fringed
</p>
<p>hunting-shirt, and wearing a silver gorget on his
</p>
<p>breast. He stopped, turned, and waved his hat,
</p>
<p>and his French followers, crowding across the road,
</p>
<p>opened a murderous fire upon the head of the
</p>
<p>British column, while, screeching their war-cries,
</p>
<p>the Indians thronged into the ravines, or crouched
</p>
<p>behind rocks and trees on both flanks of the advan-
</p>
<p>cing troops. The astonished grenadiers returned
</p>
<p>the fire, and returned it with good effect ; for a
</p>
<p>random shot struck down the brave Beaujeau, and
</p>
<p>the courage of the assailants was staggered by his
</p>
<p>fall. Dumas, second in command, rallied them to
</p>
<p>the attack ; and while he, with the French and
</p>
<p>Canadians, made good the pass in front, the Indians
</p>
<p>from their lurking places opened a deadly fire on
</p>
<p>the right and left. In a few moments, all was
</p>
<p>confusion. The advance guard fell back on the
</p>
<p>main body, and every trace of subordination van
</p>
<p>ished. The fire soon extended along the whole
</p>
<p>length of the army, from front to rear. Scarce
</p>
<p>an enemy could be seen, though the forest re-
</p>
<p>sounded with their yells ; though every bush and
</p>
<p>tree was alive with incessant flashes ; though the
</p>
<p>lead flew like a hailstorm, and the men went down
</p>
<p>by scores. The regular troops seemed bereft of

<p>their senses. They huddled together in the road

</p>
<p>the crowd, and place a barrier of human flesh
</p>
<p>between his life and the shot of the ambushed
</p>
<p>marksmen. Many were seen eagerly loading their
</p>
<p>muskets, and then firing them into the air, or shoot-
</p>
<p>ing their own comrades in the insanity of their
</p>
<p>terror. The officers, for the most part, displayed a
</p>
<p>conspicuous gallantry ; but threats and commands
</p>
<p>were wasted alike on the panic-stricken multitude.
</p>
<p>It is said that at the outset Braddock showed signs
</p>
<p>of fear ; but he soon recovered his wonted intre-
</p>
<p>pidity. Five horses were shot under him, and five
</p>
<p>times he mounted afresh. 1 He stormed and shouted,
</p>
<p>and, while the Virginians were fighting to good
</p>
<p>purpose, each man behind a tree, like the Indians
</p>
<p>themselves, he ordered them with furious menace
</p>
<p>to form in platoons, where the fire of the enemy
</p>
<p>mowed them down like grass. At length, a mortal
</p>
<p>shot silenced him, and two provincials bore him
</p>
<p>off the field. Washington rode through the tumult
</p>
<p>calm and undaunted. Two horses were killed
</p>
<p>under him, and four bullets pierced his clothes ; ?
</p>
<p>but his hour w T as not come, and he escaped with
</p>
<p>out a wound. Gates was shot through the body,
</p>
<p>and Gage also was severely w r ounded. Of eighty-
</p>
<p>ix officers, only twenty-three remained unhurt ;
</p>
<p>and of twelve hundred soldiers who crossed the
</p>
<p>Monongahela, more than seven hundred were killed
</p>
<p>and wounded. None suffered more severely than
</p>
<p>the Virginians, who had displayed throughout a

</p>
<p>degree of courage and steadiness which put the
</p>
<p>cowardice of the regulars to shame. The havoc
</p>
<p>among: them was terrible, for of their whole num-
</p>
<p>ber scarcely one-fifth left the field alive. 1
</p>
<p>The slaughter lasted three hours ; when, at
</p>
<p>length,, the survivors, as if impelled by a general
</p>
<p>impulse, rushed tumultously from the place of car-
</p>
<p>nage, and with dastardly precipitation fled across
</p>
<p>the Monongahela. The enemy did not pursue
</p>
<p>beyond the river, flocking back to the field to col
</p>
<p>lect the plunder, and gather a rich harvest of scalps.
</p>
<p>The routed troops pursued their flight until they
</p>
<p>met the rear division of the army, under Colonel
</p>
<p>Dunbar ; and even then their senseless terrors did
</p>
<p>not abate. Dunbar's soldier's caught the infection
</p>
<p>Cannon, baggage, provisions and wagons were des-
</p>
<p>troyed, and all fled together, eager to escape from
</p>
<p>the shadows of those awful woods, whose horrors
</p>
<p>haunted their imagination. They passed the
</p>
<p>defenceless settlements of the border, and hurried
</p>
<p>on to Philadelphia, leaving the unhappy people to
</p>
<p>defend themselves as they might against the toma-
</p>
<p>hawk and scalping-knife.
</p>
<p>The calamities of this disgraceful rout did not

</p>
<p>nearly all killed ; for I believe, out of three companies that were there,
</p>
<p>scarcely thirty men are left alive Captain Peyrouny, and all his officers,
</p>
<p>down to a corporal, were killed. Captain Poison had nearly as hard a
</p>
<p>fate, for only one of his was left. In short, the dastardly behavior of those
</p>
<p>they call regulars exposed all others, that were inclined to do their duty,
</p>
<p>to almost certain death ; and at last, in despite of all the efforts of the
</p>
<p>officers to the contrary, they ran, as sheep pursued by dogs, and it was
</p>
<p>impossible to rally them."  Writings of Washington, II. 87.

<p>cease with the loss of a few hundred soldiers on
</p>
<p>the field of battle ; for it brought upon the prov-
</p>
<p>inces all the miseries of an Indian war. Those
</p>
<p>among the tribes who had thus far stood neutral,
</p>
<p>wavering between the French and English, now
</p>
<p>hesitated no longer. Many of them had been dis
</p>
<p>gusted by the contemptuous behavior of Braddock
</p>
<p>All had learned to despise the courage of the
</p>
<p>English, and to regard their own prowess with
</p>
<p>unbounded complacency. It is not in Indian
</p>
<p>nature to stand quiet in the midst of war ; and
</p>
<p>the defeat of Braddock was a signal for the
</p>
<p>western savages to snatch their tomahawks and
</p>
<p>assail the English settlements with one accord,
</p>
<p>murdering and pillaging with ruthless fury, and
</p>
<p>turning the frontier of Pennsylvania and Virginia
</p>
<p>into one wide scene of havoc and desolation.
</p>
<p>The three remaining expeditions which the
</p>
<p>British ministry had planned for that year's cam-
</p>
<p>paign were attended with various results. Acadia
</p>
<p>was quickly reduced by the forces of Colonel
</p>
<p>Monkton ; but the glories of this easy victory
</p>
<p>were tarnished by an act of cruelty. Seven thou
</p>
<p>sand of the unfortunate people, refusing to take
</p>
<p>the prescribed oath of allegiance, were seized by
</p>
<p>the conquerors, torn from their homes, placed on
</p>
<p>shipboard like cargoes of negro slaves, and trans-
</p>
<p>ported to the British provinces. 1 The expedition
</p>
<p>against Niagara was a total failure, for the troops
</p>
<p>did not even reach their destination. The move-

</p>
<p>success, as regards the main object of the enter-
</p>
<p>prise. Owing to the lateness of the season, and
</p>
<p>other causes, the troops proceeded no farther than
</p>
<p>Lake George ; but the attempt was marked by a
</p>
<p>feat of arms, which, in that day of failures, was
</p>
<p>greeted, both in England and Ameiica, as a signal
</p>
<p>victory.
</p>
<p>General Johnson, afterwards Sir William John
</p>
<p>son, had been charged with the conduct of the
</p>
<p>Crown Point expedition ; and his little army, a
</p>
<p>rude assemblage of hunters and farmers from New
</p>
<p>York and New England, officers and men alike
</p>
<p>ignorant of war, lay encamped at the southerr
</p>
<p>extremity of Lake George. Here, while they
</p>
<p>languidly pursued their preparations, their active
</p>
<p>enemy anticipated them. Baron Dieskau, who,
</p>
<p>with a body of troops, had reached Quebec in the
</p>
<p>squadron which sailed from Brest in the spring,
</p>
<p>had intended to take forcible possession of the
</p>
<p>English fort of Oswego, erected upon ground
</p>
<p>claimed by the French as a part of Canada.
</p>
<p>Learning Johnson's movements, he changed his
</p>
<p>plan, crossed Lake Champlain, made a circuit by
</p>
<p>way of Wood Creek, and gained the rear of the
</p>
<p>English army, with a force of about two thousand
</p>
<p>French and Indians. At midnight, on the seventh
</p>
<p>of September, the tidings reached Johnson that the
</p>
<p>army of the French baron was but a few miles
</p>
<p>distant from his camp. A council of war was
</p>
<p>called, and the resolution formed of detaching a
</p>
<p>thousand men to reconnoitre. " If they are to be

</p>
<p>are too many ; if they are to fight, they are too
</p>
<p>few." His remonstrance was unheeded ; and the
</p>
<p>brave old savage, unable from age and corpulence
</p>
<p>to fight on foot, mounted his horse, and joined
</p>
<p>the English detachment with two hundred of his
</p>
<p>warriors. At sunrise, the party defiled from the
</p>
<p>camp, and entering the forest disappeared from
</p>
<p>the eyes of their comrades.
</p>
<p>Those who remained behind labored with all the
</p>
<p>energy of alarm to fortify their unprotected camp.
</p>
<p>An hour elapsed, when from the distance was
</p>
<p>heard a sudden explosion of musketry. The
</p>
<p>excited soldiers suspended their work to listen.
</p>
<p>A rattling lire succeeded, deadened among the
</p>
<p>woods, but growing louder and nearer, till none
</p>
<p>could doubt that their comrades had met the
</p>
<p>French, and were defeated.
</p>
<p>This was indeed the case. Marching through
</p>
<p>thick woods, by the narrow and newly-cut road
</p>
<p>which led along the valley southward from Lake
</p>
<p>George, Williams, the English commander, had
</p>
<p>led his men full into an ambuscade, where all
</p>
<p>Dieskau's army lay in wait to receive them. From
</p>
<p>the woods on both sides rose an appalling shout,
</p>
<p>followed by a storm of bullets. Williams was
</p>
<p>soon shot down ; Hendrick shared his fate ; many
</p>
<p>officers fell, and the road was strewn with dead
</p>
<p>and wounded soldiers. The English gave way at
</p>
<p>once. Had they been regular troops, the result
</p>
<p>would have been worse ; but every man was a
</p>
<p>woodsman and a hunter. Some retired in bodies

</p>
<p>themselves through the forest, opposing a wide
</p>
<p>front to the enemy, fighting stubbornly as they
</p>
<p>retreated, and shooting back at the French from
</p>
<p>behind every tree or bush that could afford a cover.
</p>
<p>The Canadians and Indians pressed them closely.;
</p>
<p>darting, with shrill cries, from tree to tree, while
</p>
<p>Dieskau's regulars, with steadier advance, bore all
</p>
<p>b jfore them. Far and wide through the forest rang
</p>
<p>shout and shriek and Indian whoop, mingled with
</p>
<p>the deadly rattle of guns. Retreating and pur-
</p>
<p>suing, the combatants passed northward towards
</p>
<p>the English camp, leaving the ground behind them
</p>
<p>strewn with dead and dying.
</p>
<p>A fresh detachment from the camp came in aid
</p>
<p>of the English, and the pursuit was checked. Yet
</p>
<p>che retreating men were not the less rejoiced when
</p>
<p>they could discern, between the brown columns
</p>
<p>of the woods, the mountains and waters of Lake
</p>
<p>George, with the white tents of their encampments
</p>
<p>on its shore. The French followed no farther.
</p>
<p>The blast of their trumpets was heard recalling
</p>
<p>their scattered men for a final attack.
</p>
<p>During the absence of Williams's detachment,
</p>
<p>the main body of the army had covered the front
</p>
<p>of their camp with a breastwork,  if that name
</p>
<p>can be applied to a row of logs,  behind which the
</p>
<p>maiksmen lay flat on their faces. This preparation
</p>
<p>was not yet complete, when the defeated troops
</p>
<p>appeared issuing from the woods. Breathless and
</p>
<p>perturbed, they entered the camp, and lay down
</p>
<p>with the rest ; and the army waited the attack in

</p>
<p>Soon, at the edge of the woods which bordered
</p>
<p>the open space in front, painted Indians were seen,
</p>
<p>and bayonets glittered among the foliage, shining.
</p>
<p>in the homely comparison of a New-England
</p>
<p>soldier, like a row of icicles on a January morn
</p>
<p>ing. The French regulars marched in column to
</p>
<p>the edge of the clearing, and formed in line, con-
</p>
<p>fronting the English at the distance of a hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty yards. Their complete order, their white
</p>
<p>uniforms and bristling bayonets, were a new and
</p>
<p>startling sight to the eyes of Johnson's rustic
</p>
<p>soldiers, who raised but a feeble cheer in answer
</p>
<p>to the shouts of their enemies. Happily, Dieskau
</p>
<p>made no assault. The regulars opened a distant
</p>
<p>fire of musketry, throwing volley after volley against
</p>
<p>the English, while the Canadians and Indians, dis-
</p>
<p>persing through the morasses on each flank of the
</p>
<p>camp, fired sharply, under cover of the trees and
</p>
<p>bushes. In the rear, the English were protected
</p>
<p>by the lake ; but on the three remaining sides,
</p>
<p>they were hedged in by the flash and smoke of
</p>
<p>musketry.
</p>
<p>The fire of the French had little effect. The
</p>
<p>English recovered from their first surprise, and
</p>
<p>every moment their confidence rose higher and
</p>
<p>their shouts grew louder. Levelling their long
</p>
<p>hunting guns with cool precision, they returned a
</p>
<p>fire which thinned the ranks of the French, and
</p>
<p>galled them beyond endurance. Two cannon were
</p>
<p>soon brought to bear upon the morasses which
</p>

<p>ants were so terrified by the crashing of the balls
</p>
<p>among the trunks and branches, that they gave
</p>
<p>way at once. Dieskau still persisted in the attack.
</p>
<p>From noon until past four o'clock, the firing was
</p>
<p>scarcely abated, when at length the French, who
</p>
<p>had suffered extremely, showed signs of wavering.
</p>
<p>At this, with a general shout, the English broke
</p>
<p>from their camp, and rushed upon their enemies,
</p>
<p>striking them down with the buts of their guns.
</p>
<p>and driving them through the woods like deer.
</p>
<p>Dieskau was taken prisoner, dangerously wounded,
</p>
<p>and leaning for support against the stump of a
</p>
<p>tree. The slaughter would have been great, had
</p>
<p>not the English general recalled the pursuers, and
</p>
<p>suffered the French to continue their flight unmo-
</p>
<p>lested. Fresh disasters still awaited the fugitives ;
</p>
<p>for, as they approached the scene of that morning's
</p>
<p>ambuscade, they were greeted by a volley of mus-
</p>
<p>ketry. Two companies of New York and New
</p>
<p>Hampshire rangers, who had come out from Fort
</p>
<p>Edward as a scouting party, had lain in wait to
</p>
<p>receive them. Favored by the darkness of the
</p>
<p>woods,  for night was now approaching,  they
</p>
<p>made so sudden and vigorous an attack, that the
</p>
<p>French, though far superior in number, were totally
</p>
<p>routed and dispersed. 1

</p>
<p>This memorable conflict has cast its dark associ-
</p>
<p>ations over one of the most beautiful spots in
</p>
<p>America. Near the scene of the evening fight, a
</p>
<p>pool, half overgrown by weeds and water lilies, and
</p>
<p>darkened by the surrounding forest, is pointed out
</p>
<p>to the tourist, and he is told that beneath its stag
</p>
<p>nant waters lie the bones of three hundred French
</p>
<p>men, deep buried in mud and slime.
</p>
<p>The war thus begun was prosecuted for five
</p>
<p>succeeding years with the full energy of both
</p>
<p>nations. The period was one of suffering and
</p>
<p>anxiety to the colonists, who, knowing the full
</p>
<p>extent of their danger, spared no exertion to avert
</p>
<p>it. In the year 1758, Lord Abercrombie, who then
</p>
<p>commanded in America, had at his disposal a force
</p>
<p>amounting to fifty thousand men, of whom the
</p>
<p>greater part were provincials. 1 The operations of
</p>
<p>the war embraced a wide extent of country, from
</p>
<p>Cape Breton and Nova Scotia to the sources of the
</p>
<p>half of the engraving, the French army is represented lying in ambus-
</p>
<p>aide in the form of a horseshoe. Hendrick is conspicuous among the
</p>
<p>English, from being mounted on horseback, while all the others are on
</p>
<p>foot. In the view of the battle at the lake, the English are represented
</p>
<p>lying flat on their faces, behind their breastwork, and busily firing at the
</p>
<p>French and Indians, who are seen skulking among the woods and
</p>
<p>thickets.
</p>
<p>I am again indebted to President Sparks for the opportunity of exam-
</p>
<p>ining several curious manuscripts relating to the battle of Lake George.
</p>
<p>Among them is Dieskau's official account of the affair, and a curious
</p>
<p>paper, also written by the defeated general, and containing the story of
</p>
<p>Ids disaster, as related by himself in an imaginary conversation with his
</p>
<p>old commander, Marshal Saxe, in the Elysian Fields. Several writers
</p>
<p>have stated that Dieskau died of his wounds. This, however, was not
</p>
<p>the case. He was carried prisoner to England, where he lived for severai

<p>Ohio ; but nowhere was the contest so actively car-
</p>
<p>ried on as in the neighborhood of Lake George,
</p>
<p>the waters of which, joined with those of Lake
</p>
<p>Champlaia, formed the main avenue of communi-
</p>
<p>cation between Canada and the British provinces.
</p>
<p>Lake George is more than thirty miles long, but of
</p>
<p>width so slight that it seems like some broad and
</p>
<p>placid river, enclosed between ranges of lofty moun
</p>
<p>tains ; now contracting into narrows, dotted with
</p>
<p>islands and shadowed by cliffs and crags, now
</p>
<p>spreading into a clear and open expanse. It had
</p>
<p>long been known to the French. The Jesuit Isaac
</p>
<p>Jogues, bound on a fatal mission to the ferocious
</p>
<p>Mohaw T ks, had reached its banks on the eve of
</p>
<p>Corpus Christi Day, and named it Lac St. Sac-
</p>
<p>rement. Its solitude was now rudely invaded.
</p>
<p>Armies passed and repassed upon its tranquil
</p>
<p>bosom. At its northern point the French planted
</p>
<p>their stronghold of Ticonderoga ; at its southern
</p>
<p>stood the English fort William Henry, while the
</p>
<p>mountains and waters between were a scene of
</p>
<p>ceaseless ambuscades, surprises, and forest skir-
</p>
<p>mishing. Through summer and winter, the crack
</p>
<p>of rifles and the cries of men gave no rest to their
</p>
<p>echoes ; and at this day, on the field of many a for-
</p>
<p>gotten fight, are dug up rusty tomahawks, corroded
</p>
<p>bullets, and human bones, to attest the struggles of
</p>
<p>the past.
</p>
<p>The earlier years of the war were unpropitious

<p>to the English, whose commanders displayed no

<p>great degree of vigor or ability. In the summer of

</p>
<p>Oswego, took it, and levelled it to the ground. In
</p>
<p>August of the following year, he struck a heavier
</p>
<p>blow. Passing Lake George with a force of eight
</p>
<p>thousand men, including about two thousand In-
</p>
<p>dians, gathered from the farthest parts of Canada,
</p>
<p>he laid siege to Fort William Henry, close to the
</p>
<p>spot where Dieskau had been defeated two years
</p>
<p>before. Planting his batteries against it, he beat
</p>
<p>down its ramparts and dismounted its guns, until
</p>
<p>the garrison, after a brave defence, were forced to
</p>
<p>capitulate. They marched out with the honors of
</p>
<p>war ; but scarcely had they done so, when Mont-
</p>
<p>calm's Indians assailed them, cutting down and
</p>
<p>scalping them without mercy. Those who escaped
</p>
<p>came in to Fort Edward with exaggerated accounts
</p>
<p>of the horrors from which they had fled, and a
</p>
<p>general terror was spread through the country.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants were mustered from all parts to
</p>
<p>repel the advance of Montcalm ; but the French
</p>
<p>general, satisfied with what he had done, repassed
</p>
<p>Lake George, and retired behind the walls of
</p>
<p>Ticonderoga.
</p>
<p>In the year 1758, the war began to assume a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent aspect, for Pitt was at the head of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. Sir Jeffrey Amherst laid siege to the
</p>
<p>strong fortress of Louisburg, and at length reduced
</p>
<p>it ; while in the south, General Forbes marched
</p>
<p>against Fort du Quesne, and, more fortunate than
</p>
<p>his predecessor, Braddock, drove the French from
</p>
<p>that important point. Another successful stroke
</p>
<p>was the destruction of Fort Frontenac, which was

</p>
<p>street. These achievements were counterbalanced
</p>
<p>by a great disaster. Lord Abercrombie, with an
</p>
<p>army of sixteen thousand men, advanced to the
</p>
<p>head of Lake George, the place made memorable
</p>
<p>by Dieskau's defeat and the loss of Fort William
</p>
<p>Henry. On a brilliant July morning, he embarked
</p>
<p>his whole force for an attack on Ticonderoga.
</p>
<p>Many of those present have recorded with admi-
</p>
<p>ration the beauty of the spectacle, the lines of
</p>
<p>boats filled with troops stretching far down the
</p>
<p>lake, the flashing of oars, the glitter of weapons,
</p>
<p>and the music ringing back from crags and rocks,
</p>
<p>or dying in mellowed strains among the distant
</p>
<p>mountains. At night, the army landed, and, driv-
</p>
<p>ing in the French outposts, marched through the
</p>
<p>woods towards Ticonderoga. One of their col-
</p>
<p>umns, losing its way in the forest, fell in with a
</p>
<p>body of the retreating French ; and in the conflict
</p>
<p>that ensued, Lord Howe, the favorite of the army,
</p>
<p>was shot dead. On the eighth of July, they pre-
</p>
<p>pared to storm the lines which Montcalm had
</p>
<p>drawn across the peninsula in front of the fortress.
</p>
<p>Advancing to the attack, they saw before them a
</p>
<p>breastwork of uncommon height and thickness.
</p>
<p>The French army were drawn up behind it, their
</p>
<p>heads alone visible, as they levelled their muskets
</p>
<p>against the assailants, while, for a hundred yards in
</p>
<p>front of the work, the ground was covered with
</p>
<p>felled trees, with sharpened branches pointing out-
</p>
<p>ward. The signal of assault was given. In vain

<p>their broadswords among the branches, struggling

<p>124 COLLISION OF THE "RIVAL COLONIES. [1759
</p>
<p>to get at the enemy. In vain the English, with
</p>
<p>their deep-toned shout, rushed on in heavy columns.
</p>
<p>A tempest of musket balls met them, and Mont-
</p>
<p>calm's cannon swept the whole ground with terrible
</p>
<p>rain age. A few officers and men forced their way
</p>
<p>through the branches, passed the ditch, climbed
</p>
<p>the breastwork, and, leaping among the enemy,
</p>
<p>were instantly bayonetted. The English fought
</p>
<p>four hours with determined valor, but the position
</p>
<p>of the French was impregnable ; and at length,
</p>
<p>having lost two thousand of their number, the
</p>
<p>army drew off, leaving many of their dead scattered
</p>
<p>upon the field. A sudden panic seized the defeated
</p>
<p>troops. They rushed in haste to their boats, and,
</p>
<p>though no pursuit was attempted, they did not
</p>
<p>regain their composure until Lake George was
</p>
<p>between them and the enemy. The fatal lines of
</p>
<p>Ticonderoga were not soon forgotten in the prov-
</p>
<p>inces ; and marbles in Westminster Abbey preserve
</p>
<p>the memory of those who fell on that disastrous day.
</p>
<p>This repulse, far from depressing the energies of
</p>
<p>the British commanders, seemed to stimulate them
</p>
<p>to new exertion ; and the campaign of the next
</p>
<p>year, 1759, had for its object the immediate and
</p>
<p>total reduction of Canada. This unhappy country
</p>
<p>was full of misery and disorder. Peculation and
</p>
<p>every kind of corruption prevailed among its civil
</p>
<p>and military chiefs, a reckless licentiousness was
</p>
<p>increasing among the people, and a general famine
</p>
<p>seemed impending, for the population had of late
</p>
<p>years been drained away for military service, and

<p>the fields were left untilled. In spite of their suf

</p>
<p>ferings, the Canadians, strong in rooted antipathy
</p>
<p>to the English, and highly excited by their priests,
</p>
<p>resolved on fighting to the last. Prayers were
</p>
<p>offered up in the churches, masses said, and pen-
</p>
<p>ances enjoined, to avert the wrath of God from the
</p>
<p>colony, while every thing was done for its defence
</p>
<p>which the energies of a great and patriotic leader
</p>
<p>could effect.
</p>
<p>By the plan of this summer's campaign, Canada
</p>
<p>was to be assailed on three sides at once. Upon
</p>
<p>the west, General Prideaux was to attack Niagara ;
</p>
<p>upon the south, General Amherst was to advance
</p>
<p>upon Ticonderoga and Crown Point ; while upon
</p>
<p>the east, General Wolfe was to besiege Quebec ;
</p>
<p>and each of these armies, having accomplished its
</p>
<p>particular object, was directed to push forward, if
</p>
<p>possible, until all three had united in the heart of
</p>
<p>Canada. In pursuance of the plan, General Pri-
</p>
<p>deaux moved up Lake Ontario and invested Niagara.
</p>
<p>This post was one of the greatest importance. Its
</p>
<p>capture would cut off the French from the whole
</p>
<p>interior country, and they therefore made every
</p>
<p>effort to raise the siege. An army of seventeen
</p>
<p>hundred French and Indians, collected at the dis-
</p>
<p>tant garrisons of Detroit, Presqu' Isle, Le Bceuf,
</p>
<p>and Venango, suddenly appeared before Niagara. 1
</p>
<p>Sir William Johnson was now in command of the
</p>
<p>English, Prideaux having been killed by the burst-
</p>
<p>ing of a cohorn. Advancing in order of battle, he
</p>
<p>met the French, charged, routed, and pursued them

</p>
<p>for five miles through the woods. This success was
</p>
<p>soon followed by the surrender of the fort.
</p>
<p>In the mean time. Sir Jeffrey Amherst had
</p>
<p>crossed Lake George, and appeared before Ticon-
</p>
<p>deroga ; upon which the French blew up their
</p>
<p>works, and retired down Lake Champlain to Crown
</p>
<p>Point. Retreating from this position also, on the
</p>
<p>approach of the English army, they collected all
</p>
<p>their forces, amounting to little more than three
</p>
<p>thousand men, at Isle Aux Noix, where they
</p>
<p>intrenched themselves, and prepared to resist the
</p>
<p>farther progress of the invaders. The lateness of
</p>
<p>the season prevented Amherst from carrying out the
</p>
<p>plan of advancing into Canada, and compelled him
</p>
<p>to go into winter-quarters at Crown Point. The
</p>
<p>same cause had withheld Prideaux's army from
</p>
<p>descending the St. Lawrence.
</p>
<p>While the outposts of Canada were thus success-
</p>
<p>fully attacked, a blow was struck at a more vital
</p>
<p>part. Early in June, General Wolfe sailed up the
</p>
<p>St. Lawrence with a force of eight thousand men,
</p>
<p>and formed his camp immediately below Quebec,
</p>
<p>on the Island of Orleans. 1 From thence he could
</p>
<p>discern, at a single glance, how arduous was the
</p>
<p>task before him. Piles of lofty cliffs rose with
</p>
<p>sheer ascent on the northern border of the river ;
</p>
<p>and from their summits the boasted citadel of Can-
</p>
<p>ada looked down in proud security, with its churches
</p>
<p>and convents of stone, its ramparts, bastions, and
</p>
<p>batteries ; while over them all, from the brink of

<p>the piecipice, towered the massive walls of the
</p>
<p>Castle of St. Louis. Above, for many a league, the
</p>
<p>bank was guarded by an unbroken range of steep
</p>
<p>acclivities. Below, the River St. Charles, flowing
</p>
<p>into the St. Lawrence, washed the base of the
</p>
<p>rocky promontory on which the city stood. Lower
</p>
<p>yet lay an army of fourteen thousand men, under
</p>
<p>an able and renowned commander, the Marquis of
</p>
<p>Montcalm. His front was covered by intrench-
</p>
<p>ments and batteries, which lined the bank of the
</p>
<p>St. Lawrence ; his right wing rested on the city
</p>
<p>and the St. Charles ; his left, on the cascade
</p>
<p>and deep gulf of Montmorenci ; and thick forests
</p>
<p>extended along his rear. Opposite Quebec rose
</p>
<p>the high promontory of Point Levi; and the St.
</p>
<p>Lawrence, contracted to less than a mile in width,
</p>
<p>flowed between, with deep and powerful current.
</p>
<p>To a chief of less resolute temper, it might well
</p>
<p>have seemed that art and nature were in league to
</p>
<p>thwart his enterprise ; but a mind like that of
</p>
<p>Wolfe could only have seen in this majestic combi-
</p>
<p>nation of forest and cataract, mountain and river, a
</p>
<p>fitting theatre for the great drama about to be
</p>
<p>enacted there.
</p>
<p>Yet nature did not seem to have formed the
</p>
<p>young English general for the conduct of a doubt-
</p>
<p>ful and almost desperate enterprise. His person
</p>
<p>was slight, and his features by no means of a mar-
</p>
<p>tial cast. His feeble constitution had been under-
</p>
<p>mined by years of protracted and painful disease, 1

</p>
<p>His kind and genial disposition seemed better fitted
</p>
<p>for the quiet of domestic life than for the stern
</p>
<p>duties of military command ; but to these gentler
</p>
<p>traits he joined a high enthusiasm, and an uncon-
</p>
<p>querable spirit of daring and endurance, which
</p>
<p>made him the idol of his soldiers, and bore his
</p>
<p>slender frame through every hardship and exposure.
</p>
<p>The work before him demanded all his courage.
</p>
<p>How to invest the city, or even bring the army of
</p>
<p>Montcalm to action, was a problem which might
</p>
<p>have perplexed a Hannibal. A French fleet lay in
</p>
<p>the river above, and the precipices along the north-
</p>
<p>ern bank were guarded at every accessible point by
</p>
<p>sentinels and outposts. Wolfe would have crossed
</p>
<p>the Montmorenci by its upper ford, and attacked
</p>
<p>the French army on its left and rear ; but the plan
</p>
<p>was thwarted by the nature of the ground and the
</p>
<p>vigilance of his adversaries. Thus baffled at every
</p>
<p>other point, he formed the bold design of storming
</p>
<p>Montcalm's position in front ; and on the afternoon
</p>
<p>of the thirty-first of July, a strong body of troops
</p>
<p>was embarked in boats, and, covered by a furious
</p>
<p>cannonade from the English ships and batteries,
</p>
<p>landed on the beach just above the mouth of the
</p>
<p>Montmorenci. The grenadiers and Royal Ameri-
</p>
<p>cans were the first on shore, and their ill-timed
</p>
<p>within the reach and compass of my skill and cunning. I am in a very

<p>batf condition, both with the gravel and rheumatism ; but I had much
</p>
<p>rather die than decline any kind of service that offers : if I followed my
</p>
<p>own taste, it would lead me into Germany ; and if my poor talent was
</p>
<p>consulted, they should place me to the cavalry, because nature has given
</p>
<p>me good eyes, and a warmth of temper to follow the first impressions.

</p>
<p>waiting to receive their orders or form their ranks,
</p>
<p>they ran, pell-mell, across the level ground, and
</p>
<p>with loud shouts began, each man for himself, to
</p>
<p>scale the heights which rose in front, crested with
</p>
<p>intrenchments and bristling with hostile arms. The
</p>
<p>French at the top threw volley after volley among
</p>
<p>the hot-headed assailants. The slopes were soon
</p>
<p>covered with the fallen ; and at that instant a
</p>
<p>storm, which had long been threatening, burst with
</p>
<p>sudden fury, drenched the combatants on both sides
</p>
<p>with a deluge of rain, extinguished for a moment
</p>
<p>the fire of the French, and at the same time made
</p>
<p>the steeps so slippery that the grenadiers fell repeat-
</p>
<p>edly in their vain attempts to climb. Night was
</p>
<p>coming on with double darkness. The retreat was
</p>
<p>sounded, and, as the English re-embarked, troops of
</p>
<p>Indians came whooping down the heights, and hov-
</p>
<p>ered about their rear, to murder the stragglers and
</p>
<p>the wounded ; while exulting cries of Vive le roi,
</p>
<p>from the crowded summits, proclaimed the triumph
</p>
<p>of the enemy.
</p>
<p>With bitter agony of mind, Wolfe beheld the
</p>
<p>headlong folly of his men, and saw more than four
</p>
<p>hundred of the flower of his army fall a useless
</p>
<p>sacrifice. 1 The anxieties of the siege had told
</p>
<p>severely upon his slender constitution ; and not
</p>
<p>long after this disaster, he felt the first symptoms
</p>
<p>of a fever, which soon confined him to his couch.
</p>
<p>Still his mind never wavered from its purpose ;
</p>
<p>and it was while lying helpless in the chamber of a

</p>
<p>Canadian house, where he had fixed his head-
</p>
<p>quarters, that he embraced the plan of the enter-
</p>
<p>prise which robbed him of life, and gave him
</p>
<p>immortal fame.
</p>
<p>This plan had been first proposed during the
</p>
<p>height of Wolfe's illness, at a council of his subor
</p>
<p>dinate generals, Monk ton, Townshend, and Murray.
</p>
<p>It was resolved to divide the little army ; and, while
</p>
<p>one portion remained before Quebec to alarm the
</p>
<p>enemy by false attacks, and distract their attention
</p>
<p>from the scene of actual operation, tbe other was
</p>
<p>to pass above the town, land under cover of dark
</p>
<p>ness on the northern shore, climb the guarded
</p>
<p>heights, gain the plains above, and force Montcalm
</p>
<p>to quit his vantage-ground, and perhaps to offer
</p>
<p>battle. The scheme was daring even to rashness ;
</p>
<p>but its audacity was the secret of its success.
</p>
<p>Early in September, a crowd of ships and trans-
</p>
<p>ports, under Admiral Holmes, passed the city
</p>
<p>under the hot fire of its batteries ; while the
</p>
<p>troops designed for the expedition, amounting to
</p>
<p>scarcely five thousand, marched upward along the
</p>
<p>southern bank, beyond reach of the cannonade.
</p>
<p>All were then embarked ; and on the evening of
</p>
<p>the twelfth, Holmes's fleet, with the troops on
</p>
<p>board, lay safe at anchor in the river, several
</p>
<p>leagues above the town. These operations had
</p>
<p>not failed to awaken the suspicions of Montcalm ;
</p>
<p>and he had detached M. Bougainville to watch the
</p>
<p>movements of the English, and prevent their land
</p>
<p>ing on the northern shore.

</p>
<p>calm, with no light but that of the stars. Within
</p>
<p>two hours before daybreak, thirty boats, crowded
</p>
<p>with sixteen hundred soldiers, cast off from the
</p>
<p>vessels, and floated downward, in perfect order,
</p>
<p>with the current of the ebb tide. To the boundless
</p>
<p>joy of the army, Wolfe's malady had abated, and
</p>
<p>he was able to command in person. His ruined
</p>
<p>health, the gloomy prospects of the siege, and the
</p>
<p>disaster at Montmorenci, had oppressed him with
</p>
<p>the deepest melancholy, but never impaired for a
</p>
<p>moment the promptness of his decisions, or the
</p>
<p>impetuous energy of his action. 1 He sat in the
</p>
<p>stern of one of the boats, pale and weak, but borne
</p>
<p>up to a calm height of resolution. Every order
</p>
<p>had been given, every arrangement made, and it
</p>
<p>only remained to face the issue. The ebbing tide
</p>
<p>sufficed to bear the boats along, and nothing broke
</p>
<p>the silence of the night but the gurgling of the
</p>
<p>river, and the low voice of Wolfe, as he repeated
</p>
<p>to the officers about him the stanzas of Gray's
</p>
<p>" Elegy in a Country Churchyard," which had
</p>
<p> Entick, IV. 111.
</p>
<p>In his letter to the Ministry, dated Sept. 2, Wolfe writes in thes
</p>
<p>lesponding words : 
</p>
<p>" By the nature of the river, the most formidable part of this arma-
</p>
<p>ment is deprived of the power of acting ; yet we have almost the whole
</p>
<p>force of Canada to oppose. In this situation there is such a choice of
</p>
<p>difficulties, that I own myself at a loss how to determine. The affairs of
</p>
<p>Great Britain I know require the most vigorous measures, but then the
</p>
<p>courage of a handful of brave troops should be exerted only where there
</p>
<p>is some hope of a favorable event. However, you may be assured, that
</p>
<p>the small part of the campaign which remains shall be employed (as far
</p>
<p>as I am able) for the honor of his Majesty, and the interest of the nation ,
</p>
<p>in which I am sure of being well seconded by the admiral and by the

</p>
<p>from England. Perhaps, as he uttered thoso
</p>
<p>strangely appropriate words, 
</p>
<p>" The paths of glory lead but to the grave,"
</p>
<p>the shadows of his own approaching fate stole with
</p>
<p>mournful prophecy across his mind. " Gentlemen,"
</p>
<p>he said, as he closed his recital, " I would rather
</p>
<p>have written those lines than take Quebec to-
</p>
<p>morrow." !
</p>
<p>As they approached the landing-place, the boats
</p>
<p>edged closer in towards the northern shore, and
</p>
<p>the woody precipices rose high on their left, like a
</p>
<p>wall of undistinguished blackness.
</p>
<p>" Qui vive?" shouted a French sentinel, from
</p>
<p>out the impervious gloom.

<p>convoy from Bougainville was expected that very
</p>
<p>night, the sentinel was deceived, and allowed the
</p>
<p>English to proceed.
</p>
<p>A few moments after, they were challenged
</p>
<p>again, and this time they could discern the soldier
</p>
<p>running close down to the water's edge, as if all
</p>
<p>his suspicions were aroused ; but the skilful replies
</p>
<p>of the Highlander once more saved the party from
</p>
<p>discovery. 1
</p>
<p>They reached the landing-place in safety,  an
</p>
<p>indentation in the shore, about a league above the
</p>
<p>city, and now bearing the name of Wolfe's Cove.
</p>
<p>Here a narrow path led up the face of the heights,
</p>
<p>and a French guard was posted at the top to defend
</p>
<p>the pass. By the force of the current, the fore-
</p>
<p>most boats, including that which carried Wolfe
</p>
<p>himself, were borne a little below the spot. The
</p>
<p>general was one of the first on shore. He looked
</p>
<p>upward at the rugged heights which towered above
</p>
<p>him in the gloom. " You can try it," he coolly
</p>
<p>observed to an officer near him ; " but I don't think
</p>
<p>you'll get up." a
</p>
<p>At the point where the Highlanders landed, one
</p>
<p>of their captains, Donald Macdonald, apparently

<p>the same whose presence of mind had just saved

<p>the enterprise from ruin, was climbing in advance

<p>He replied in French, by declaring that he had
</p>
<p>been sent to relieve the guard, and ordering the
</p>
<p>soldier to withdraw. 1 Before the latter was unde-
</p>
<p>ceived, a crowd of Highlanders were close at hand,
</p>
<p>while the steeps below were thronged with eagei
</p>
<p>climbers, dragging themselves up by trees, roots,
</p>
<p>and bushes. 2 The guard turned out, and made a
</p>
<p>brief though brave resistance. In a moment, they
</p>
<p>were cut to pieces, dispersed, or made prisoners ;
</p>
<p>while men after men came swarming up the height,
</p>
<p>and quickly formed upon the plains above. Mean-
</p>
<p>while, the vessels had dropped downward with the
</p>
<p>current, and anchored opposite the landing-place.
</p>
<p>The remaining troops were disembarked, and, with
</p>
<p>the dawn of day, the whole were brought in safety
</p>
<p>to the shore.
</p>
<p>The sun rose, and, from the ramparts of Quebec,
</p>
<p>the astonished people saw the Plains of Abraham
</p>
<p>glittering with arms, and the dark-red lines of the
</p>
<p>English forming in array of battle. Breathless
</p>
<p>messengers had borne the evil tidings to Montcalm,
</p>
<p>and far and near his wide-extended camp resounded
</p>
<p>with the rolling of alarm drums and the din of
</p>
<p>startled preparation. He, too, had had his struggles
</p>
<p>and his sorrows. The civil power had thwarted
</p>
<p>him ; famine, discontent, and disaffection were rife
</p>
<p>among his soldiers ; and no small portion of the
</p>
<p>Canadian militia had dispersed from sheer starva-

<p>tion. In spite of all, he had trusted to hold out

</p>
<p>(he news of their successful temerity fell like a
</p>
<p>cannon shot upon his ear. Still he asssumed a
</p>
<p>tone of confidence. " They have got to the weak
</p>
<p>side of us at last," he is reported to have said,
</p>
<p>" and we must crush them with our numbers."
</p>
<p>With headlong haste, his troops were pouring over
</p>
<p>the bridge of the St. Charles, and gathering in
</p>
<p>heavy masses under the western ramparts of the
</p>
<p>town. Could numbers give assurance of success,
</p>
<p>theh triumph would have been secure ; for five
</p>
<p>French battalions and the armed colonial peasantry
</p>
<p>amounted in all to more than seven thousand five
</p>
<p>hundred men. Full in sight before them stretched
</p>
<p>the long, thin lines of the British forces,  the
</p>
<p>half-wild Highlanders, the steady soldiery of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, and the hardy levies of the provinces,  less
</p>
<p>than five thousand in number, but all inured to
</p>
<p>battle, and strong in the full assurance of success.
</p>
<p>Yet, could the chiefs of that gallant army have
</p>
<p>pierced the secrets of the future, could they have
</p>
<p>foreseen that the victory which they burned to
</p>
<p>achieve would have robbed England of her proud-
</p>
<p>est boast, that the conquest of Canada would pave
</p>
<p>the way for the independence of America, their
</p>
<p>swords would have dropped from their hands, and
</p>
<p>the heroic fire have gone out within their hearts.
</p>
<p>It was nine o'clock, and the adverse armies stood
</p>
<p>motionless, each gazing on the other. The clouds
</p>
<p>hung low, and, at intervals, warm light showers
</p>
<p>descended, besprinkling both alike. The coppice

<p>filled with French sharpshooters, who kept up a
</p>
<p>distant, spattering fire. Here and there a soldier
</p>
<p>fell in the ranks, and the gap was filled in silence.
</p>
<p>At a little before ten, the British could see that
</p>
<p>Montcalm was preparing to advance, and, in a few
</p>
<p>moments, all his troops appeared in rapid motion.
</p>
<p>They came on in three divisions, shouting after the
</p>
<p>manner of their nation, and firing heavily as soon
</p>
<p>as they came within range. In the British ranks,
</p>
<p>not a trigger was pulled, not a soldier stirred ;
</p>
<p>and their ominous composure seemed to damp the
</p>
<p>spirits of the assailants. It was not till the French
</p>
<p>were within forty yards that the fatal word was
</p>
<p>given, and the British muskets blazed forth at once
</p>
<p>in one crashing explosion. Like a ship at full
</p>
<p>career, arrested with sudden ruin on a sunken
</p>
<p>rock, the ranks of Montcalm staggered, shivered,
</p>
<p>and broke before that wasting storm of lead. The
</p>
<p>smoke, rolling along the field, for a moment shut
</p>
<p>out the view ; but when the white wreaths were
</p>
<p>scattered on the wind, a wretched spectacle was
</p>
<p>disclosed ; men and officers tumbled in heaps, bat-
</p>
<p>talions resolved into a mob, order and obedience
</p>
<p>gone ; and when the British muskets were levelled
</p>
<p>for a second volley, the masses of the militia were
</p>
<p>seen to cower and shrink with uncontrollable panic.
</p>
<p>For a few minutes, the French regulars stood theii
</p>
<p>ground, returning a sharp and not ineffectual fire
</p>
<p>3ut now, echoing cheer on cheer, redoubling vol-
</p>
<p>ley on volley, trampling the dying and the dead

</p>
<p>The ardor cf the men burst all restraint. Thej
</p>
<p>broke into a run, and with unsparing slaughtei
</p>
<p>chased the flying multitude to the gates of Quebec.
</p>
<p>Foremost of all, the light-footed Highlanders dashed
</p>
<p>along in furious pursuit, hewing down the French-
</p>
<p>men with their broadswords, and slaying many
</p>
<p>in the very ditch of the fortifications. Never was
</p>
<p>victory more quick or more decisive. 1
</p>
<p>In the short action and pursuit, the French lost
</p>
<p>fifteen hundred men, killed, wounded, and taken.
</p>
<p>Of the remainder, some escaped within the city,
</p>
<p>and others fled across the St. Charles to rejoin their
</p>
<p>comrades who had been left to guard the camp.
</p>
<p>The pursuers were recalled by sound of trumpet ;
</p>
<p>the broken ranks were formed afresh, and the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish troops withdrawn beyond reach of the cannon
</p>
<p>of Quebec. Bougainville, with his corps, arrived
</p>
<p>from the upper country, and, hovering about their
</p>
<p>rear, threatened an attack ; but when he saw what
</p>
<p>greeting was prepared for him, he abandoned his
</p>
<p>purpose and withdrew. Townshend and Murray,
</p>
<p>the only general officers who remained unhurt,
</p>
<p>passed to the head of every regiment in turn, and
</p>
<p>thanked the soldiers for the bravery they had
</p>
<p>shown ; yet the triumph of the victors was min-
</p>
<p>gled with sadness, as the tidings went from rank to

<p>tered his wrist ; but he wrapped his handkerchief
</p>
<p>about the wound, and showed no sign of pain. A
</p>
<p>moment more, and a ball pierced his side. Still
</p>
<p>he pressed forward, waving his sword and cheer-
</p>
<p>ing his soldiers to the attack, when a third shot
</p>
<p>lodged deep within his breast. He paused, reeled,
</p>
<p>and, staggering to one side, fell to the earth.
</p>
<p>Brown, a lieutenant of the grenadiers, Henderson,
</p>
<p>a volunteer, an officer of artillery, and a private
</p>
<p>soldier, raised him together in their arms, and,
</p>
<p>bearing him to the rear, laid him softly on the
</p>
<p>grass. They asked if he would have a surgeon ;
</p>
<p>but he shook his head, and answered that all
</p>
<p>was over with him. His eyes closed with the
</p>
<p>torpor of approaching death, and those around
</p>
<p>sustained his fainting form. Yet they could not
</p>
<p>withhold their gaze from the wild turmoil before
</p>
<p>them, and the charging ranks of their companions
</p>
<p>rushing through fire and smoke. " See how they
</p>
<p>run," one of the officers exclaimed, as the French
</p>
<p>fled in confusion before the levelled bayonets.

</p>
<p>like a man aroused from sleep. " The enemy,
</p>
<p>sir," was the reply ; " they give way everywhere."

</p>
<p>Almost at the same moment fell his great adver-
</p>
<p>sary, Montcalm, as he strove, with vain bravery,
</p>
<p>to rally his shattered ranks. Struck down with
</p>
<p>a mortal wound, he was placed upon a litter and

<p>borne to the General Hospital on the banks of the
</p>

<p>and was told that he had not many hours remain-
</p>
<p>ing. " So much the better," he said ; " I am
</p>
<p>happy that I shall not live to see the surrender of
</p>
<p>Quebec." Officers from the garrison came to his
</p>
<p>bedside to ask his orders and instructions. " I will
</p>
<p>give no more orders," replied the defeated soldier ;
</p>
<p>" I have much business that must be attended to,
</p>
<p>of greater moment than your ruined garrison and
</p>
<p>this wretched country. My time is very short ;
</p>
<p>therefore, pray leave me." The officers withdrew,
</p>
<p>and none remained in the chamber but his con-
</p>
<p>fessor and the Bishop of Quebec. To the last, he
</p>
<p>expressed his contempt for his own mutinous and
</p>
<p>half famished troops, and his admiration for the
</p>
<p>disciplined valor of his opponents. 1 He died
</p>
<p>before midnight, and was buried at his own desire

<p>in a cavity of the earth formed by the bursting of
</p>
<p>a bombshell.

<p>The victory on the Plains of Abraham and the
</p>
<p>downfall of Quebec filled all England with pride
</p>
<p>and exultation. From north to south, the land
</p>
<p>blazed with illuminations, and resounded with the
</p>
<p>ringing of bells, the firing of guns, and the shouts
</p>
<p>[ of the multitude. In one village alone all was
</p>
<p>dark and silent amid the general joy ; for here
</p>
<p>dwelt the widowed mother of Wolfe. The popu-
</p>
<p>lace, with unwonted delicacy, respected her lonely
</p>
<p>sorrow, and forbore to obtrude the sound of their

<p>rejoicings upon her grief for one who had been

</p>
<p>of French dominion in America. Her limbs and
</p>
<p>her head were lopped away, but life still fluttered
</p>
<p>at her heart. Quebec, Niagara, Frontenac, and
</p>
<p>Crown Point had fallen ; but Montreal and the
</p>
<p>adjacent country still held out, and thither, with
</p>
<p>the opening season of 1760, the British command-

<p>1755-1763.
</p>
<p>THE WILDERNESS AND ITS TENANTS AT THE CL08K
</p>
<p>OF THE FRENCH WAR.
</p>
<p>We hare already seen how, after the defeat of
</p>
<p>Braddock, the western tribes rose with one accord
</p>
<p>against the English. Then, for the first time,
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania felt the scourge of Indian war ; and
</p>
<p>tier neighbors, Maryland and Virginia, shared her
</p>
<p>misery. Through the autumn of 1755, the storm
</p>
<p>raged with devastating fury ; but the following yeai
</p>
<p>brought some abatement of its violence. This mav
</p>
<p>be ascribed partly to the interference of the Iro-
</p>
<p>quois, who, at the instances of Sir William Johnson,
</p>
<p>urged the Dela wares to lay down the hatchet, and
</p>
<p>partly to the persuasions of several prominent men
</p>
<p>among the Quakers, who, by kind and friendly
</p>
<p>treatment, had gained the confidence of the
</p>
<p>Indians. 1 By these means, that portion of the
</p>
<p>Delawares and their kindred tribes who dwelt
</p>
<p>upon the Susquehanna, were induced to send a
</p>
<p>deputation of chiefs to Easton, in the summer of

</p>
<p>1757, to meet the provincial delegates ; and here,
</p>
<p>after much delay and difficulty, a treaty of peace
</p>
<p>was concluded.
</p>
<p>This treaty, however, did not embrace the Indians
</p>
<p>of the Ohio, who comprised the most formidable
</p>
<p>part of the Delawares and Shawanoes, and who
</p>
<p>still continued their murderous attacks. It was
</p>
<p>not till the summer of 1758, when General Forbes,
</p>
<p>with a considerable army, was advancing against
</p>
<p>Fort du Quesne, that these exasperated savages
</p>
<p>could be brought to reason. Well knowing that,
</p>
<p>should Forbes prove successful, they might expect
</p>
<p>a summary chastisement for their misdeeds, they
</p>
<p>began to waver in their attachment to the French ;
</p>
<p>and the latter, in the hour of peril, found them-
</p>
<p>selves threatened with desertion by allies who had
</p>
<p>shown an ample alacrity in the season of prosperity.
</p>
<p>This new tendency of the Ohio Indians was fos-
</p>
<p>tered by a wise step on the part of the English. A
</p>
<p>man was found bold and hardy enough to venture
</p>
<p>into the midst of their villages, bearing the news
</p>
<p>of the treaty at Easton, and the approach of
</p>
<p>Forbes, coupled with proposals of peace from the
</p>
<p>governor of Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>This stout-hearted emissary was Christian Fred-
</p>
<p>eric Post, a Moravian missionary, who had long
</p>
<p>lived with the Indians, had twice married among
</p>
<p>them, and, by his upright dealings and plain good
</p>
<p>sense, had gained their confidence and esteem
</p>
<p>His devout and conscientious spirit, his fidelity t

<p>for the critical mission. His journals, written in
</p>
<p>a style of quaint simplicity, are full of lively
</p>
<p>details, and afford a curious picture of forest life
</p>
<p>and character. He left Philadelphia in July,
</p>
<p>attended by a party of friendly Indians, on whom
</p>
<p>he relied for protection. Reaching the Ohio, he
</p>
<p>found himself beset with perils from the jealousy
</p>
<p>and malevolence of the savage warriors, and the
</p>
<p>machinations of the French, who would gladly
</p>
<p>have destroved him. 1 Yet he found friends where-
</p>
<p>1 The following are extracts from his journals : 
</p>
<p>" We set out from Kushkushkee for Sankonk ; my company consisted
</p>
<p>of twenty-five horsemen and fifteen foot. We arrived at Sankonk in the
</p>
<p>afternoon. The people of the town were much disturbed at my coming,
</p>
<p>and received me in a very rough manner. They surrounded me with
</p>
<p>drawn knives in their hands, in such a manner that I could hardly get
</p>
<p>along ; running up against me with their breasts open, as if they wanted
</p>
<p>some pretence to kill me. I saw by their countenances they sought my
</p>
<p>death- Their faces were quite distorted with rage, and they went so far
</p>
<p>as to say, I should not live long ; but some Indians, with whom I was
</p>
<p>formerly acquainted, coming up and saluting me in a friendly manner,
</p>
<p>their behavior to me was quickly changed." ..." Some of my party
</p>
<p>desired me not to stir from the fire, for that the French had offered a
</p>
<p>great reward for my scalp, and that there were several parties out on that
</p>
<p>purpose. Acccordingly I stuck constantly as close to the fire as if I had
</p>
<p>been chained there. . . .
</p>
<p>" In the afternoon, all the captains gathered together in the middle
</p>
<p>town ; they sent for us, and desired we should give them information of
</p>
<p>our message. Accordingly we did. We read the message with great
</p>
<p>satisfaction to them. It was a great pleasure both to them and us. The
</p>
<p>number of captains and counsellors were sixteen. In the evening, mes-
</p>
<p>sengers arrived from Fort Duquesne, with a string of wampum from the
</p>
<p>commander ; upon which they all came together in the house where we
</p>
<p>lodged. The messengers delivered their string, with these words from

<p>their father, the French king : 
</p>
<p>" ' My children, come to me, and hear what I have to say. The Eng-
</p>
<p>lish are coming with an army to destroy both you and me. I therefore
</p>
<p>desire you immediately, my children, to hasten with all the young men ;
</p>
<p>we will drive the English and destroy them. I, as a father, will tell you
</p>
<p>always what is best.' He laid the string before one of the captains.
</p>
<p>After a little conversation, the captain stood up, and said I have just

</p>
<p>ever he went, and finally succeeded in convincing
</p>
<p>the Indians that their true interest lay in a strict
</p>
<p>neutrality. When, therefore, Forbes appeared
</p>
<p>before Fort du Quesne, the French found them-
</p>
<p>selves abandoned to their own resources ; and,
</p>
<p>unable to hold their ground, they retreated down
</p>
<p>the Ohio, leaving the fort an easy conquest to the
</p>
<p>invaders. During the autumn, the Ohio Indians
</p>
<p>sent their deputies to Easton, where a great council
</p>
<p>was held, and a formal peace concluded with the
</p>
<p>provinces. 1
</p>
<p>While the friendship of these tribes was thus
</p>
<p>lost and regained, their ancient tyrants, the Iro-
</p>
<p>quois, remained in a state of very doubtful attach
</p>
<p>ment. At the outbreak of the war, they had
</p>
<p>shown, it is true, many signs of friendship ; 2 but
</p>
<p>the disasters of the first campaign had given them
</p>
<p>heard something of our brethren, the English, which pleaseth me much
</p>
<p>better. I will not go. Give it to the others ; maybe they will go/ The
</p>
<p>messenger took up again the string, and said, ' He won't go ; he has
</p>
<p>heard of the English.' Then all cried out, ' Yes, yes, we have heard
</p>
<p>from the English.' He then threw the string to the other fireplace, where
</p>
<p>the other captains were ; but they kicked it from one to another, as if it
</p>
<p>was a snake. Captain Peter took a stick, and with it flung the string
</p>
<p>from one end of the room to the other, and said, ' Give it to the French
</p>
<p>captain, and let him go with his young men ; he boasted much of his
</p>
<p>fighting ; now let us see his fighting. We have often ventured our lives
</p>
<p>for him; and had hardly a loaf of bread when we came to him; and now
</p>
<p>he thinks we should jump to serve him.' Then we saw the French cap-
</p>
<p>tain mortified to the uttermost ; he looked as pale as death. The Indians
</p>
<p>discoursed and joked till midnight ; and the French captain sent messen-
</p>
<p>gers at midnight to Fort Duquesne."
</p>
<p>The kicking about of the wampum belt is the usual indication of con-
</p>
<p>tempt for the message of which the belt is the token. The uses of wam-

<p>a contempt for British conduct and courage. This
</p>
<p>impression was deepened, when, in the following
</p>
<p>year, they saw Oswego taken by the French, and
</p>
<p>the British general, Webb, retreat with dastardly
</p>
<p>haste from an enemy who did not dream of pursu-
</p>
<p>ing him. At this time, some of the confederates
</p>
<p>actually took up the hatchet on the side of France,
</p>
<p>and there was danger that the rest might follow
</p>
<p>their example. 1 But now a new element was
</p>
<p>infused into the British counsels. The fortunes
</p>
<p>of the conflict began to change. Du Quesne and
</p>
<p>Louisburg were taken, and the Iroquois conceived
</p>
<p>a better opinion of the British arms. Their friend-
</p>
<p>ship was no longer a matter of doubt ; and in 1760,
</p>
<p>when Amherst was preparing to advance on Mon-
</p>
<p>treal, the warriors flocked to his camp like vultures
</p>
<p>to the carcass. Yet there is little doubt, that, had
</p>
<p>their sachems and orators followed the dictates of
</p>
<p>their cooler judgment, they would not have aided
</p>
<p>in destroying Canada ; for they could see that in
</p>
<p>the colonies of France lay the only barrier against
</p>
<p>the growing power and ambition of the English
</p>
<p>provinces.
</p>
<p>The Hurons of Lorette, the Abenakis, and
</p>
<p>other domiciliated tribes of Canada, ranged them-
</p>
<p>selves on the side of France throughout the war ;
</p>
<p>and at its conclusion, they, in common with the
</p>
<p>Canadians, may be regarded in the light of a con-
</p>
<p>quered people.
</p>
<p>The numerous tribes of the remote west had,

<p>allies of the French ; and warriors might be
</p>
<p>found on the farthest shores of Lake Superior who
</p>
<p>garnished their war-dress with the scalp-locks of
</p>
<p>murdered Englishmen. With the conquest of
</p>
<p>Canada, these tribes subsided into a state of inac-
</p>
<p>tion, which was not long to continue.
</p>
<p>And now, before launching into the story of the
</p>
<p>sanguinary war which forms our proper and imme-
</p>
<p>diate theme, it will be well to survey the grand
</p>
<p>arena of the strife, the goodly heritage which the
</p>
<p>wretched tribes of the forest struggled to retrieve
</p>
<p>from the hands of the spoiler.
</p>
<p>One vast, continuous forest shadowed the fertile
</p>
<p>soil, covering the land as the grass covers a garden
</p>
<p>lawn, sweeping over hill and hollow in endless
</p>
<p>undulation, burying mountains in verdure, and
</p>
<p>mantling brooks and rivers from the light of day.
</p>
<p>Green intervals dotted with browsing deer, and
</p>
<p>broad plains alive with buffalo, broke the same-
</p>
<p>ness of the woodland scenery. Unnumbered rivers
</p>
<p>seamed the forest with their devious windings.
</p>
<p>Vast lakes washed its boundaries, where the Indian
</p>
<p>voyager, in his birch canoe, could descry no land
</p>
<p>beyond the world of waters. Yet this prolific
</p>
<p>wilderness, teeming with waste fertility, was but a
</p>
<p>hunting-ground and a battle-field to a few fierce
</p>
<p>hordes of savages. Here and there, in some rich
</p>
<p>meadow opened to the sun, the Indian squaws
</p>
<p>turned the black mould with their rude imple-
</p>
<p>ments of bone or iron, and sowed their scanty
</p>
<p>stores of maize and beans. Human labor drew no

</p>
<p>So thin and scattered was the native population,
</p>
<p>that, even in those parts which were thought well
</p>
<p>peopled, one might sometimes journey for days
</p>
<p>together through the twilight forest, and meet no
</p>
<p>human form. Broad tracts were left in solitude.
</p>
<p>All Kentucky was a vacant waste, a mere skirmish-
</p>
<p>ing ground for the hostile war-parties of the north
</p>
<p>and south. A great part of Upper Canada, of
</p>
<p>Michigan, and of Illinois, besides other portions
</p>
<p>of the west, were tenanted by wild beasts alone.
</p>
<p>To form a close estimate of the numbers of the
</p>
<p>erratic bands who roamed this wilderness would
</p>
<p>be impossible ; but it may be affirmed that, be-
</p>
<p>tween the Mississippi on the west and the ocean
</p>
<p>on the east, between the Ohio on the south and
</p>
<p>Lake Superior on the north, the whole Indian
</p>
<p>population, at the close of the French war, did
</p>
<p>not greatly exceed ten thousand fighting men.
</p>
<p>Of these, following the statement of Sir William
</p>
<p>Johnson, in 1763, the Iroquois had nineteen hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty, the Delawares about six hundred,
</p>
<p>the Shawanoes about three hundred, the Wyandots
</p>
<p>about four hundred and fifty, and the Miami tribes,
</p>
<p>with their neighbors the Kickapoos, eight hun-
</p>
<p>dred ; while the Ottawas, the Ojibwas, and other
</p>
<p>wandering tribes of the north, defy all efforts at
</p>
<p>enumeration. 1
</p>
<p>A close survey of the condition of the tribes at
</p>
<p>this period will detect some signs of improvement,

</p>
<p>quite accord with that of Johnson. But the discrepancy is no greater

</p>
<p>commence with the Iroquois, for to them with jus-
</p>
<p>tice the priority belongs : Onondaga, the ancient
</p>
<p>capital of their confederacy, where their council-
</p>
<p>fire had burned from immemorial time, was now
</p>
<p>no longer what it had been in the days of its great-
</p>
<p>ness, when Count Frontenac had mustered all
</p>
<p>Canada to assail it. The thickly clustered dwell-
</p>
<p>ings, with their triple rows of palisades, had van-
</p>
<p>ished. A little stream, twisting along the valley,
</p>
<p>choked up with logs and driftwood, and half hid-

<p>den by woods and thickets, some forty houses of

<p>bark, scattered along its banks, amid rank grass,
</p>
<p>neglected clumps of bushes, and ragged patches
</p>
<p>of corn and peas,  such was Onondaga when

<p>Bartram saw it, and such, no doubt, it remained at
</p>
<p>the time of which I write. 1 Conspicuous among
</p>
<p>the other structures, and distinguished only by its
</p>
<p>superior size, stood the great council-house, whose
</p>
<p>bark walls had often sheltered the congregated
</p>
<p>wisdom of the confederacy, and heard the highest
</p>
<p>efforts of forest eloquence. The other villages of
</p>
<p>the Iroquois resembled Onondaga ; for though sev-
</p>
<p>eral were of larger size, yet none retained those
</p>
<p>defensive stockades which had once protected them. 3

<p>were to be found among them. Guns and gun*
</p>
<p>powder aided them in the chase. Knives, hatchets,
</p>
<p>kettles, and hoes of iron, had supplanted their rude
</p>
<p>household utensils and implements of tillage ; but
</p>
<p>with all this, English whiskey had more than can-
</p>
<p>celled every benefit which English civilization had
</p>
<p>conferred.
</p>
<p>High up the Susquehanna were seated the Nanti-
</p>
<p>cokes, Conoys, and Mohicans, with a portion of the
</p>
<p>Delawares. Detached bands of the western Iro-
</p>
<p>quois dwelt upon the head waters of the Alle-
</p>
<p>ghany, mingled with their neighbors, the Delawares,
</p>
<p>who had several villages upon this stream. The
</p>
<p>great body of the latter nation, however, lived
</p>
<p>upon the Beaver Creeks and the Muskingum, in
</p>
<p>numerous scattered towns and hamlets, whose bar-
</p>
<p>barous names it is useless to record. Squalid log
</p>
<p>cabins and conical wigwams of bark were clustered
</p>
<p>at random, or ranged to form rude streets and
</p>
<p>squares. Starveling horses grazed on the neigh-
</p>
<p>boring meadows ; girls and children bathed and
</p>
<p>laughed in the adjacent river ; warriors smoked
</p>
<p>their pipes in haughty indolence ; squaws labored
</p>
<p>in the cornfields, or brought fagots from the forest
</p>
<p>and shrivelled hags screamed from lodge to lodge.
</p>
<p>In each village one large building stood prominent
</p>
<p>among the rest, devoted to purposes of public
</p>
<p>meeting, dances, festivals, and the entertainment
</p>
<p>of strangers. Thither the traveller would be con-
</p>
<p>ducted, seated on a bear-skin, and plentifully
</p>
<p>regaled with hominy and venison.

<p>the Scioto and its branches. Farther towards the
</p>
<p>west, on the waters of the Wabash and the
</p>
<p>Maumee, dwelt the Miamis, who, less exposed,
</p>
<p>from their position, to the poison of the whiskey
</p>
<p>keg, and the example of debauched traders, re-
</p>
<p>tained their ancient character and customs in
</p>
<p>greater purity than their eastern neighbors. This
</p>
<p>cannot be said of the Illinois, who dwelt near the
</p>
<p>borders of the Mississippi, and who, having lived
</p>
<p>for more than half a century in close contact with
</p>
<p>the French, had become a corrupt and degenerate
</p>
<p>race. The Wyandots of Sandusky and Detroit far
</p>
<p>surpassed the surrounding tribes in energy of
</p>
<p>character and in social progress. Their log dwell-
</p>
<p>ings were strong and commodious, their agriculture
</p>
<p>was very considerable, their name stood high in
</p>
<p>war and policy, and they were regarded with
</p>
<p>deference by all the adjacent Indians. It is need-
</p>
<p>less to pursue farther this catalogue of tribes,
</p>
<p>since the position of each w T ill appear hereafter as
</p>
<p>they advance in turn upon the stage of action.
</p>
<p>The English settlements lay like a narrow strip
</p>
<p>between the wilderness and the sea, and, as the sea
</p>
<p>had its ports, so also the forest had its places of
</p>
<p>rendezvous and outfit. Of these, by far the most
</p>
<p>important in the northern provinces was the frontier
</p>
<p>city of Albany. From thence it was that traders
</p>
<p>and soldiers, bound to the country of the Iroquois,

</p>
<p>portage at the Cataract of Niagara.
</p>
<p>The chief thoroughfare from the middle colonies
</p>
<p>to the Indian country was from Philadelphia west-
</p>
<p>ward, across the Alleghanies, to the valley of the
</p>
<p>Ohio. Peace was no sooner concluded with the
</p>
<p>hostile tribes, than the adventurous fur- traders,
</p>
<p>careless of risk to life and property, hastened
</p>
<p>over the mountains, each eager to be foremost in
</p>
<p>the wilderness market. Their merchandise was
</p>
<p>sometimes carried in wagons as far as the site of
</p>
<p>Fort du Quesne, which the English rebuilt after its
</p>
<p>capture, changing its name to Fort Pitt. From
</p>
<p>this point the goods were packed on the backs
</p>
<p>of horses, and thus distributed among the various
</p>
<p>Indian villages. More commonly, however, the
</p>
<p>whole journey was performed by means of trains,
</p>
<p>or, as they were called, brigades of packhorses,
</p>
<p>which, leaving the frontier settlements, climbed the
</p>
<p>shadowy heights of the Alleghanies, and threaded
</p>
<p>the forests of the Ohio, diving through thickets,
</p>
<p>and wading over streams. The men employed in
</p>
<p>this perilous calling were a rough, bold, and
</p>
<p>intractable class, often as fierce and truculent as
</p>
<p>the Indians themselves. A blanket coat, or a
</p>
<p>frock of smoked deer-skin, a rifle on the shoulder,
</p>
<p>and a knife and tomahawk in the belt, formed
</p>
<p>their ordinary equipment. The principal trader,
</p>
<p>the owner of the merchandise, would fix his head
</p>
<p>quarters at some large Indian town, whence he
</p>
<p>would despatch his subordinates to the surrounding

</p>
<p>red cloth, guns and hatchets, liquor, tobacco, paint,
</p>
<p>beads, and hawks' bells. This wild traffic was
</p>
<p>liable to every species of disorder : and it is not to
</p>
<p>be wondered at that, in a region where law was
</p>
<p>unknown, the jealousies of rival traders should
</p>
<p>become a fruitful source of broils, robberies, and
</p>
<p>murders.
</p>
<p>In the backwoods, all land travelling was on
</p>
<p>foot, or on horseback. It was no easy matter for
</p>
<p>a novice, embarrassed with his cumbrous gun, to
</p>
<p>urge his horse through the thick trunks and under-
</p>
<p>growth, or even to ride at speed along the narrow
</p>
<p>Indian trails, where at every yard the impending
</p>
<p>branches switched him across the face. At night,
</p>
<p>the camp would be formed by the side of some
</p>
<p>rivulet or spring ; and, if the traveller was skilful
</p>
<p>in the use of his rifle, a haunch of venison would
</p>
<p>often form his evening meal. If it rained, a shed
</p>
<p>of elm or bass-wood bark was the ready work of
</p>
<p>an hour, a pile of evergreen boughs formed a bed,
</p>
<p>and the saddle or the knapsack a pillow. A party
</p>
<p>of Indian wayfarers would often be met journeying
</p>
<p>through the forest, a chief, or a warrior, perhaps,
</p>
<p>with his squaws and family. The Indians would
</p>
<p>usually make their camp in the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>the white men ; and at meal- time the warrior
</p>
<p>would seldom fail to seat himself by the traveller's
</p>
<p>fire, and gaze with solemn gravity at the viands
</p>
<p>before him. If, when the repast was over, a frag-
</p>
<p>ment of bread or a cup of coffee should be handed
</p>
<p>to him, he would receive these highly prized

<p>nothing is more remarkable in the character of
</p>
<p>this people than the union of inordinate pride and
</p>
<p>a generous love of glory with the mendicity of a
</p>
<p>beggar or a child.
</p>
<p>He who wished to visit the remoter tribes of the
</p>

</p>
<p>until several years after the conquest of Canada,
</p>
<p>no Englishman could have made without great
</p>
<p>risk of losing his scalp  would find no easier
</p>
<p>course than to descend the Ohio in a canoe or
</p>
<p>bateau. He might float for more than eleven
</p>
<p>hundred miles down this liquid highway of the
</p>
<p>wilderness, and, except the deserted cabins of
</p>
<p>Logstown, a little below Fort Pitt, the remnant
</p>
<p>of a Shawanoe village at the mouth of the Scioto,
</p>
<p>and an occasional hamlet or solitary wigwam along
</p>
<p>the deeply wooded banks, he would discern no
</p>
<p>trace of human habitation through all this vast
</p>
<p>extent. The body of the Indian population lay
</p>
<p>to the northward, about the waters of the tributary
</p>
<p>streams. It behooved the voyager to observe a sleep-
</p>
<p>less caution and a hawk-eyed vigilance. Some-
</p>
<p>times his anxious scrutiny would detect a faint
</p>
<p>blue smoke stealing upward above the green bosom
</p>
<p>of the forest, and betraying the encamping place of
</p>
<p>some lurking war-party. Then the canoe would
</p>
<p>be drawn in haste beneath the overhanging bushes
</p>
<p>which skirted the shore ; nor would the voyage be
</p>
<p>resumed until darkness closed, when the little
</p>
<p>vessel would drift swiftly and safely by the point
</p>
<p>of danger. 1

</p>
<p>Within the nominal limits of the Illinois Indians,
</p>
<p>and towards the southern extremity of the present
</p>
<p>state of Illinois, were those isolated Canadian set-
</p>
<p>tlements, which had subsisted here since the latter
</p>
<p>part of the preceding century. Kaskaskia, Caho-
</p>
<p>kia, and Vincennes were the centres of this scat-
</p>
<p>tered population. From Vincennes one might
</p>
<p>paddle his canoe northward up the Wabash, until
</p>
<p>he reached the little wooden fort of Ouatanon.
</p>
<p>Thence a path through the woods led to the banks
</p>
<p>of the Maumee. Two or three Canadians, or half-
</p>
<p>breeds, of whom there were numbers about the fort,
</p>
<p>would carry the canoe on their shoulders, or, for a
</p>
<p>bottle of whiskey, a few Miami Indians might be
</p>
<p>bribed to undertake the task. On the Maumee, at
</p>
<p>the end of the path, stood Fort Miami, near the
</p>
<p>spot where Fort Wayne was afterwards built.
</p>
<p>From this point one might descend the Maumee to
</p>
<p>Lake Erie, and visit the neighboring fort of San-
</p>
<p>dusky, or, if he chose, steer through the Strait of
</p>
<p>Detroit, and explore the watery wastes of the
</p>
<p>northern lakes, finding occasional harborage at the
</p>
<p>little military posts which commanded their impor-
</p>
<p>tant points. Most of these western posts were
</p>
<p>transferred to the English, during the autumn of
</p>
<p>17G0; but the settlements of the Illinois remained
</p>
<p>several years longer under French control.

<p>Bceuf, and Venango, which had passed into the
</p>
<p>hands of the English soon after the capture of
</p>
<p>Fort du Quesne. The feeble garrisons of all these
</p>
<p>western posts, exiled from civilization, lived in the
</p>
<p>solitude of military hermits. Through the long,
</p>
<p>hot days of summer, and the protracted cold of
</p>
<p>winter, time hung heavy on their hands. Their
</p>
<p>resources of employment and recreation were few
</p>
<p>and meagre. They found partners in their loneli
</p>
<p>ness among the young beauties of the Indian camps.
</p>
<p>They hunted and fished, shot at targets, and played
</p>
<p>at games of chance ; and when, by good fortune, a
</p>
<p>traveller found his way among them, he was greeted
</p>
<p>with a hearty and open-handed welcome, and plied
</p>
<p>with eager questions touching the great world from
</p>
<p>which they were banished men. Yet, tedious as it
</p>
<p>was, their secluded life was seasoned with stirring
</p>
<p>danger. The surrounding forests were peopled
</p>
<p>with a race dark and subtle as their own sunless
</p>
<p>mazes. At any hour, those jealous tribes might
</p>
<p>raise the war-cry. No human foresight could pre-
</p>
<p>dict the sallies of their fierce caprice, and in cease-
</p>
<p>less watching lay the only safety.
</p>
<p>When the European and the savage are brought
</p>
<p>in contact, both are gainers, and both are losere.
</p>
<p>The former loses the refinements of civilization,
</p>
<p>but he gains, in the rough schooling of the wil-
</p>
<p>derness, a rugged independence, a self-sustaining
</p>
<p>energy, and powers of action and perception before
</p>
<p>unthought of. The savage gains new means of

<p>comfort and support, cloth, iron, and gunpowder ;

<p>instruments of ruin. They soon become necessi-
</p>
<p>ties, and the unhappy hunter, forgetting the wea
</p>
<p>pons of his fathers, must thenceforth depend on the
</p>
<p>white man for ease, happiness, and life itself.
</p>
<p>Those rude and hardy men, hunters and traders,
</p>
<p>scouts and guides, who ranged the woods beyond
</p>
<p>the English borders, and formed a connecting link
</p>
<p>between barbarism and civilization, have been
</p>
<p>touched upon already. They were a distinct,
</p>
<p>peculiar class, marked with striking contrasts of
</p>
<p>good and evil. Many, though by no means all,
</p>
<p>were coarse, audacious, and unscrupulous ; yet,
</p>
<p>even in the worst, one might often have found a
</p>
<p>vigorous growth of warlike virtues, an iron endur-
</p>
<p>ance, an undespairing courage, a wondrous sagacity,
</p>
<p>and singular fertility of resource. In them was
</p>
<p>renewed, with all its ancient energy, that wild and
</p>
<p>daring spirit, that force and hardihood of mind,
</p>
<p>which marked our barbarous ancestors of Germany
</p>
<p>and Norway. These sons of the wilderness still
</p>
<p>survive. We may find them to this day, not in the
</p>
<p>valley of the Ohio, nor on the shores of the lakes,
</p>
<p>but far westward on the desert range of the buffalo,
</p>
<p>and among the solitudes of Oregon. Even now,
</p>
<p>while I write, some lonely trapper is climbing the
</p>
<p>perilous defiles of the Rocky Mountains, his strong
</p>
<p>frame cased in time-worn buck-skin, his rifle griped
</p>
<p>in his sinewy hand. Keenly he peers from side to
</p>
<p>side, lest Blackfoot or Arapahoe should ambuscade
</p>
<p>his path. The rough earth is his bed, a morsel of

<p>dried meat and a draught of water are his food and

<p>anchorite coald fare worse, no hero could dare
</p>
<p>more ; yet his wild, hard life has resistless charms ;
</p>
<p>and, while he can wield a rifle, he will never leave
</p>
<p>it. Go with him to the rendezvous, and he is a
</p>
<p>stoic no more. Here, rioting among his comrades,
</p>
<p>his native appetites break loose in mad excess, in
</p>
<p>deep carouse, and desperate gaming. Then follow
</p>
<p>close the quarrel, the challenge, the fight,  two
</p>
<p>rusty rifles and fifty yards of prairie.
</p>
<p>The nursling of civilization, placed in the midst
</p>
<p>of the forest, and abandoned to his own resources,
</p>
<p>is helpless as an infant. There is no clew to the
</p>
<p>labyrinth. Bewildered and amazed, he circles
</p>
<p>round and round in hopeless wanderings. Despair
</p>
<p>and famine make him their prey, and unless the
</p>
<p>birds of heaven minister to his wants, he dies in
</p>
<p>misery. Not so the practised woodsman. To him,
</p>
<p>the forest is a home. It yields him food, shelter,
</p>
<p>and raiment, and he threads its trackless depths
</p>
<p>with undeviating foot. To lure the game, to cir-
</p>
<p>cumvent the lurking foe, to guide his course by the
</p>
<p>stars, the wind, the streams, or the trees,  such
</p>
<p>are the arts which the white man has learned from
</p>
<p>the red. Often, indeed, the pupil has outstripped
</p>
<p>his master. He can hunt as well ; he can fight
</p>
<p>better ; and yet there are niceties of the woods-
</p>
<p>man's craft in which the white man must yield the
</p>
<p>palm to his savage rival. Seldom can he boast, in
</p>

<p>A striking example of Indian acuteness once came under my obser

<p>vation. Travelling in company with a Canadian named Raymond, and
</p>
<p>an Ogillallah Indian, we came at nightfall to a small stream called Chug

<p>water, a branch of Laramie Creek. As we prepared to encamp, we ob-
</p>
<p>served the ashes of a fire, the footprints of men and horses, and other
</p>
<p>indications that a party had been upon the spot not many days before

<p>Having secured our horses for the night, Raymond and I sat down and
</p>
<p>lighted our pipes, my companion, who had spent his whole life in the
</p>
<p>Indian country, hazarding various conjectures as to the numbers and
</p>
<p>character of our predecessors. Soon after, we were joined by the Indian,
</p>
<p>who, meantime, had been prowling about the place. Raymond asked
</p>
<p>what discovery he had made. He answered, that the party were friendly,
</p>
<p>and that they consisted of eight men, both whites and Indians, several of
</p>
<p>whom he named, affirming that he knew them well. To an inquiry how
</p>
<p>he gained his information, he would make no intelligible reply. On the
</p>
<p>next day, reaching Fort Laramie, a post of the American Fur Company,
</p>
<p>we found that he was correct in every particular,  a circumstance the

<p>more remarkable, as he had been with us for three weeks, and could have

<p>1760.
</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH TAKE POSSESSION OF THE WESTERN
</p>
<p>POSTS.
</p>
<p>The war was over. The plains around Montreal
</p>
<p>were dotted with the white tents of three victorious
</p>
<p>armies, and the work of conquest was complete.
</p>
<p>Canada, with all 'her dependencies, had yielded to
</p>
<p>the British crown ; but it still remained to carry
</p>
<p>into full effect the terms of the surrender, and take
</p>
<p>possession of those western outposts, where the
</p>
<p>lilies of France had not as yet descended from the
</p>
<p>flagstaff. The execution of this task, neither an
</p>
<p>easy nor a safe one, was assigned to a provincial
</p>
<p>officer, Major Robert Rogers.
</p>
<p>Rogers was a native of New Hampshire. He
</p>
<p>commanded a body of provincial rangers, and stood
</p>
<p>in high repute as a partisan officer. Putnam and
</p>
<p>Stark were his associates ; and it was in this wood-
</p>
<p>land warfare that the former achieved many of
</p>
<p>those startling adventures and hair-breadth escapes
</p>
<p>which have made his name familiar at every New-
</p>

<p>own, and armed, like Indians, with hatchet, knife,
</p>
<p>and gun, were employed in a service of peculiar
</p>
<p>hardship. Their chief theatre of action was the
</p>
<p>mountainous region of Lake George, the debatable
</p>
<p>ground between the hostile forts of Ticonderoga
</p>
<p>and William Henry. The deepest recesses of
</p>
<p>these romantic solitudes had heard the French and
</p>
<p>Indian yell, and the answering shout of the hardy
</p>
<p>New-England men. In summer, they passed down
</p>
<p>the lake in whale boats or canoes, or threaded the
</p>
<p>pathways of the woods in single file, like the
</p>
<p>savages themselves. In winter, they journeyed
</p>
<p>through the swamps on snowshoes, skated along
</p>
<p>the frozen surface of the lake, and bivouacked at
</p>
<p>night among the snow-drifts. They intercepted
</p>
<p>French messengers, encountered French scouting
</p>
<p>parties, and carried off prisoners from under the
</p>
<p>very walls of Ticonderoga. Their hardships and
</p>
<p>adventures, their marches and countermarches,
</p>
<p>their frequent skirmishes and midwinter battles,
</p>
<p>had made them famous throughout America ; and
</p>
<p>though it was the fashion of the day to sneer at
</p>
<p>the efforts of provincial troops, the name of
</p>
<p>Rogers's Hangers was never mentioned but with
</p>
<p>honor.
</p>
<p>Their commander was a man tall and strong in
</p>
<p>person, and rough in feature. He was versed
</p>
<p>in all the arts of woodcraft, sagacious, prompt, and
</p>
<p>resolute, yet so cautious withal that he sometimes
</p>
<p>incurred the unjust charge of cowardice. His

<p>mind, naturally active, was by no means uncul-

</p>
<p>bear witness that his style as a writer was not
</p>
<p>contemptible. But his vain, restless, and grasping
</p>
<p>spirit, and more than doubtful honesty, proved the
</p>
<p>ruin of an enviable reputation. Six years after
</p>
<p>the expedition of which I am about to speak, he
</p>
<p>was tried by a court-martial for a meditated act of
</p>
<p>treason, the surrender of Fort Michillimackinac
</p>
<p>into the hands of the Spaniards, who were at that
</p>
<p>time masters of Upper Louisiana. 1 Not long after,
</p>
<p>if we may trust his own account, he passed over
</p>
<p>to the Barbary States, entered the service of the
</p>
<p>Dey of Algiers, and fought two battles under his
</p>
<p>banners. At the opening of the war of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, he returned to his native country, where
</p>
<p>he made professions of patriotism, but was strongly
</p>
<p>suspected by many, including Washington himself,
</p>
<p>of acting the part of a spy. In fact, he soon
</p>
<p>openly espoused the British cause, and received a
</p>
<p>colonel's commission from the crown. His ser-
</p>
<p>vices, however, proved of little consequence. In
</p>
<p>1778, he was proscribed and banished, under the
</p>
<p>act of New Hampshire, and the remainder of his
</p>
<p>life was passed in such obscurity that it is difficult
</p>
<p>to determine when and where he died. 2

<p>Although Rogers, especially where his pecuniary interest was con-

<p>cerned, wa3 far from scrupulous, I have no hesitation in following his

<p>account of the expedition up the lakes. The incidents of each day are

<p>164 THE ENGLISH IN THE WEST. [1700
</p>
<p>On the twelfth of September, 1760, Rogers, then
</p>
<p>at the height of his reputation, received orders
</p>
<p>from Sir Jeffrey Amherst to ascend the lakes with
</p>
<p>a detachment of rangers, and take possession, in
</p>
<p>the name of his Britannic Majesty, of Detroit,
</p>
<p>Michillimackinac, and other western posts included
</p>
<p>in the late capitulation. He left Montreal, on the
</p>
<p>following day, with two hundred rangers, in fifteen
</p>
<p>whale boats. Stemming the surges of La Chine
</p>
<p>and the Cedars, they left behind them the straggling
</p>
<p>hamlet which bore the latter name, and formed at
</p>
<p>that day the western limit of Canadian settlement. 1
</p>
<p>They gained Lake Ontario, skirted its northern
</p>
<p>shore, amid rough and boisterous weather, and
</p>
<p>crossing at its western extremity, reached Fort
</p>
<p>Niagara on the first of October. Carrying their
</p>
<p>and his Concise Account of North America, a small volume containing much
</p>
<p>valuable information. Both appeared in London in 1765. To these may
</p>
<p>be added a curious drama, called Ponteach, or the Savages of America, which
</p>
<p>appears to have been written, in part, at least, by him. It is very rare,
</p>
<p>and besides the copy in my possession, I know of but one other, which
</p>
<p>may be found in the library of the British Museum. For an account of
</p>
<p>this curious production, see Appendix, B. An engraved full-length por-
</p>
<p>trait of Rogers was published in London in 1776. He is represented as a
</p>
<p>tall, strong man, dressed in the costume of a ranger, with a powder-horn
</p>
<p>slung at his side, a gun resting in the hollow of his arm, and a coun-
</p>
<p>tenance by no means prepossessing. Behind him, at a little distance,
</p>
<p>stand his Indian followers.
</p>
<p>The steep mountain called Rogers' Slide, near the northern end of
</p>
<p>Lake George, derives its name from the tradition that, during the French
</p>
<p>war, being pursued by a party of Indians, he slid on snowshoes down ita
</p>
<p>precipitous front, for more than a thousand feet, to the frozen lake below.
</p>
<p>On beholding the achievement, the Indians, as well they might, believed
</p>
<p>him under the protection of the Great Spirit, and gave over the chase.

<p>The story seems unfounded ; yet it was not far from this mountain that
</p>
<p>the rangers fought one of their most desperate winter battles, against 8
</p>
<p>force of many times their number.

<p>boats over the portage, they launched them once
</p>
<p>more above the cataract, and slowly pursued their
</p>
<p>voyage ; while Rogers, with a few attendants,
</p>
<p>hastened on in advance to Fort Pitt, to deliver
</p>
<p>despatches, with which he was charged, to General
</p>
<p>Monkton. This errand accomplished, he rejoined
</p>
<p>his command at Presqu' Isle, about the end of the
</p>
<p>month, and the whole proceeded together along
</p>
<p>the southern margin of Lake Erie. The season
</p>
<p>was far advanced. The wind was chill, the lake
</p>
<p>was stormy, and the woods on shore were tinged
</p>
<p>with the fading hues of autumn. On the seventh
</p>
<p>of November, they reached the mouth of a river
</p>
<p>called by Rogers the Chogage. No body of troops
</p>
<p>under the British flag had ever before penetrated
</p>
<p>so far. The day was dull and rainy, and, resolving
</p>
<p>to rest until the weather should improve, Rogers
</p>
<p>ordered his men to prepare their encampment in
</p>
<p>the neighboring forest.
</p>
<p>Soon after the arrival of the rangers, a party
</p>
<p>of Indian chiefs and warriors entered the camp.
</p>
<p>They proclaimed themselves an embassy from
</p>
<p>Pontiac, ruler of all that country, and directed,
</p>
<p>in his name, that the English should advance no
</p>
<p>farther until they had had an interview with the
</p>
<p>great chief, who was already close at hand. In
</p>
<p>truth, before the day closed, Pontiac himself
</p>
<p>appeared ; and it is here, for the first time, that
</p>
<p>this remarkable man stands forth distinctly on
</p>
<p>the page of history. He greeted Rogers with the
</p>
<p>haughty demand, what was his business in that

</p>
<p>country, and how he dared enter it without his
</p>
<p>166 THE ENGLISH IN THE WEST. [176C
</p>
<p>permission. Rogers informed him that the French
</p>
<p>were defeated, that Canada had surrendered, and
</p>
<p>that he was on his way to take possession of
</p>
<p>Detroit, and restore a general peace to white men
</p>
<p>and Indians alike. Pontiac listened with attention
</p>
<p>but only replied that he should stand in the path
</p>
<p>of the English until morning. Having inquired if
</p>
<p>the strangers were in need of any thing which his
</p>
<p>country could afford, he withdrew, with his chiefs
</p>
<p>at nightfall, to his own encampment ; while the
</p>
<p>English, ill at ease, and suspecting treachery, stood
</p>
<p>well on their guard throughout the night. 1
</p>
<p>In the morning, Pontiac returned to the camp
</p>
<p>with his attendant chiefs, and made his reply to
</p>
<p>Rogers's speech of the previous day. He was
</p>
<p>willing, he said, to live at peace with the English,
</p>
<p>and suffer them to remain in his country as long
</p>
<p>as they treated him with due respect and deference.
</p>
<p>The Indian chiefs and provincial officers smoked
</p>
<p>the calumet together, and perfect harmony seemed
</p>
<p>established between them. 2
</p>
<p>Up to this time, Pontiac had been, in word and
</p>
<p>deed, the fast ally of the French ; but it is easy to
</p>
<p>discern the motives that impelled him to renounce
</p>
<p>his old adherence. The American forest never pro-
</p>
<p>duced a man more shrewd, politic, and ambitious.
</p>
<p>Ignorant as he was of what was passing in the
</p>
<p>world, he could clearly see that the French power
</p>
<p>1 There can be no reasonable doubt, that the interview with Pontiac,
</p>
<p>described by Rogers in his Account of North America, took place on tin
</p>
<p>occasion indicated in his Journals, under date of the 7th of November
</p>
<p>The Indians whom he afterwards met are stated to have been Hurons.

</p>
<p>was on the wane, and he knew his own interest
</p>
<p>too well to prop a falling cause. By making
</p>
<p>friends of the English, he hoped to gain powerful
</p>
<p>allies, who would aid his ambitious projects, and
</p>
<p>give him an increased influence over the tribes ;
</p>
<p>and he flattered himself that the new-comers would
</p>
<p>treat him with the same respect which the French
</p>
<p>had always observed. In this, and all his other
</p>
<p>expectations of advantage from the English, he
</p>
<p>was doomed to disappointment.
</p>
<p>A cold storm of rain set in, and the rangers
</p>
<p>were detained several days in their encampment.
</p>
<p>During this time, Rogers had several interviews
</p>
<p>with Pontiac, and was constrained to admire the
</p>
<p>native vigor of his intellect, no less than the sin
</p>
<p>gular control which he exercised over those around
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>On the twelfth of November, the detachment was
</p>
<p>again in motion, and within a few days they had
</p>
<p>reached the western end of Lake Erie. Here they
</p>
<p>heard that the Indians of Detroit were in arms
</p>
<p>against them, and that four hundred warriors lay
</p>
<p>in ambush at the entrance of the river to cut them
</p>
<p>off. But the powerful influence of Pontiac was
</p>
<p>exerted in behalf of his new friends. The warriors
</p>
<p>abandoned their design, and the rangers continued
</p>
<p>their progress towards Detroit, now within a short
</p>
<p>distance.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, Lieutenant Brehm had been
</p>
<p>sent forward with a letter to Captain Beletre, the
</p>
<p>commandant at Detroit, informing him that Canada

</p>
<p>had capitulated, that his garrison was included in
</p>
<p>168 THE ENGLISH IN THE WEST [1760
</p>
<p>the capitulation, and that an English detachment
</p>
<p>was approaching to relieve it. The Frenchman,
</p>
<p>in great wrath at the tidings, disregarded the mes
</p>
<p>sage as an informal communication, and resolved
</p>
<p>to keep a hostile attitude to the last. He did his
</p>
<p>best to rouse the fury of the Indians. Among
</p>
<p>other devices, he displayed upon a pole, before the
</p>
<p>yelling multitude, the effigy of a crow pecking a
</p>
<p>man's head ; the crow representing himself, and
</p>
<p>the head, observes Rogers, " being meant for my
</p>
<p>own." All his efforts were unavailing, and his
</p>
<p>faithless allies showed unequivocal symptoms of
</p>
<p>defection in the hour of need.
</p>
<p>Rogers had now entered the mouth of the River
</p>
<p>Detroit, whence he sent forward Captain Campbell
</p>
<p>with a copy of the capitulation, and a letter from
</p>
<p>the Marquis de Vaudreuil, directing that the place
</p>
<p>should be given up, in accordance with the terms
</p>
<p>agreed upon between him and General Amherst.
</p>
<p>Beletre was forced to yield, and with a very ill
</p>
<p>grace declared himself and his garrison at the
</p>
<p>disposal of the English commander.
</p>
<p>The whale boats of the rangers moved slowly
</p>
<p>upwards between the low banks of the Detroit,
</p>
<p>until at length the green uniformity of marsh and
</p>
<p>forest was relieved by the Canadian houses, which
</p>
<p>began to appear on either bank, the outskirts of
</p>
<p>the secluded and isolated settlement. Before them,
</p>
<p>on the right side, they could see the village of the
</p>
<p>Wyandots, and on the left the clustered lodges of
</p>
<p>the Pottawattamies ; while, a little beyond, the

</p>
<p>the bark roofs and weather-beaten palisades of the
</p>
<p>little fortified town.
</p>
<p>The rangers landed on the opposite bank, and
</p>
<p>pitched their tents upon a meadow, while two
</p>
<p>officers, with a small detachment, went across the
</p>
<p>river to take possession of the place. In obedience
</p>
<p>to their summons, the French garrison defiled upon
</p>
<p>the plain, and laid down their arms. The jieur de
</p>
<p>lis was lowered from the flagstaff, and the cross of
</p>
<p>St. George rose aloft in its place, while seven hun-
</p>
<p>dred Indian warriors, lately the active allies of
</p>
<p>France, greeted the sight with a burst of tri-
</p>
<p>umphant yells. The Canadian militia were next
</p>
<p>called together and disarmed. The Indians looked
</p>
<p>on with amazement at their obsequious behavior,
</p>
<p>quite at a loss to understand why so many men
</p>
<p>should humble themselves before so few. Nothing
</p>
<p>is more effective in gaining the respect, or even
</p>
<p>attachment, of Indians than a display of power.
</p>
<p>The savage spectators conceived the loftiest idea

<p>Rogers himself, with a small party, proceeded
</p>
<p>northward to relieve the French garrison of
</p>
<p>Michillimackinac. The storms and gathering ice
</p>
<p>of Lake Huron forced him back without accom-
</p>
<p>plishing his object ; and Michillimackinac, with the
</p>
<p>three remoter posts of St. Marie, Green Bay, and

<p>forest, with its tracery of interlacing streams, which,

<p>possession and the slenderness of the force em

<p>to the keeping of some five or six hundred men.

<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>1760-1763.
</p>
<p>ANGER OF THE INDIANS.  THE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>The country was scarcely transferred to tne
</p>
<p>English, when smothered murmurs of discontent
</p>
<p>began to be audible among the Indian tribes.
</p>
<p>From the head of the Potomac to Lake Superior,
</p>
<p>and from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, in
</p>
<p>every wigwam and hamlet of the forest, a deep-
</p>
<p>rooted hatred of the English increased with rapid
</p>
<p>growth. Nor is this to be wondered at. We have
</p>
<p>seen with what sagacious policy the French had
</p>
<p>labored to ingratiate themselves with the Indians ;
</p>
<p>and the slaughter of the Monongahela, with the
</p>
<p>horrible devastation of the western frontier, the
</p>
<p>outrages perpetrated at Oswego, and the massacre
</p>
<p>at Fort William Henry, bore witness to the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of their efforts. Even the Delawares and
</p>
<p>Shawanoes, the faithful allies of William Penn,
</p>
<p>had at length been seduced by their blandishments ;
</p>
<p>and the Iroquois, the ancient enemies of Canada
</p>
<p>had half forgotten their former hostility, and well-
</p>
<p>nigh taken part against the British colonists. The

<p>remote nations of the west had also joined in the

</p>
<p>war, descending in their canoes for hundreds of
</p>
<p>miles, to fight against the enemies of France. All
</p>
<p>these tribes entertained towards the English that
</p>
<p>rancorous enmity which an Indian always feels
</p>
<p>against those to whom he has been opposed in
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it behooved the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish to use the utmost care in their conduct towards
</p>
<p>the tribes. But even when the conflict with France
</p>
<p>was impending, and the alliance with the Indians
</p>
<p>was of the last importance, they had treated them
</p>
<p>with indifference and neglect. They were not likely
</p>
<p>to adopt a different course now that their friendship
</p>
<p>seemed a matter of no consequence. In truth, the
</p>
<p>intentions of the English were soon apparent. In
</p>
<p>the zeal for retrenchment, which prevailed after the
</p>
<p>close of hostilities, the presents which it had always
</p>
<p>been customary to give the Indians, at stated inter-
</p>
<p>vals, were either withheld altogether, or doled out
</p>
<p>with a niggardly and reluctant hand ; while, to
</p>
<p>make the matter worse, the agents and officers of
</p>
<p>government often appropriated the presents to
</p>
<p>themselves, and afterwards sold them at an exorbi-
</p>
<p>tant price to the Indians. 1 When the French had
</p>
<p>possession of the remote forts, they were accus-
</p>
<p>tomed, with a wise liberality, to supply the sur
</p>
<p>rounding Indians with guns, ammunition, and
</p>
<p>clothing, until the latter had forgotten the weapons
</p>
<p>and garments of their forefathers, and depended on
</p>
<p>the white men for support. The sudden withhold-
</p>
<p>ing of these supplies was, therefore, a grievous

<p>calamity. Want, suffering, and death, were the
</p>
<p>consequences ; and this cause alone would have
</p>
<p>been enough to produce general discontent. But,
</p>
<p>unhappily, other grievances were superadded. 1
</p>
<p>The English fur-trade had never been well regu-
</p>
<p>lated, and it was now in a worse condition than
</p>
<p>ever. Many of the traders, and those in their

<p>" I shall not take upon me to point out the Originall Parsimony &c. to
</p>
<p>w h the first defection of the Indians can with justice & certainty be at-
</p>
<p>tributed, but only observe, as I did in a former letter, that the Indians
</p>
<p>(whose friendship was never cultivated by the English with that atten-
</p>
<p>tion, expense, & assiduity with w h y e French obtained their favour) were
</p>
<p>for many years jealous of our growing power, were repeatedly assured by
</p>
<p>the French (who were at y e pains of having many proper emissaries
</p>
<p>among them) that so soon as we became masters of this country, we
</p>
<p>should immediately treat them with neglect, hem them in with Posts &
</p>
<p>Forts, encroach upon their Lands, and finally destroy them. All w h after
</p>
<p>the reduction of Canada, seemed to appear too clearly to the Indians, who
</p>
<p>thereby lost the great advantages resulting from the possession w h the
</p>
<p>French formerly had of Posts & Trade in their Country, neither of which
</p>
<p>they could have ever enjoyed but for the notice they took of the Indians,
</p>
<p>& the presents they bestowed so bountifully upon them, w h however
</p>
<p>expensive, they wisely foresaw was infinitely cheaper, and much more
</p>
<p>effectual than the keeping of a large body of Eegular Troops, in their sev
</p>
<p>eral Countrys, ... a Plan which has endeared their memory to most of
</p>
<p>the Indian Nations, who would I fear generally go over to them in case
</p>
<p>they ever got footing again in this Country, & who were repeatedly ex-
</p>
<p>horted, & encouraged by the French (from motives of Interest & dislike
</p>
<p>w h they will always possess) to fall upon us, by representing that their
</p>
<p>liberties & Country were in y e utmost danger." In January, 1763,
</p>
<p>Colonel Bouquet, commanding in Pennsylvania, writes to General Am-
</p>
<p>nerst, stating the discontent produced among the Indians by the sup-

<p>&c, that I can by no means agree to; nor can I think it necessary to give
</p>
<p>them any presents by way of Bribes, for if they do not behave properly
</p>
<p>they are to be punished." And again, in February, to the same officer,

<p>treatment of the Indians in general, you will of course order Cap. Ecuyer

<p>employ, were ruffians of the coarsest stamp, who
</p>
<p>vied with each other in rapacity, violence, and
</p>
<p>profligacy. They cheated, cursed, and plundered
</p>
<p>the Indians, and outraged their families ; offering,
</p>
<p>when compared with the French traders, who were
</p>
<p>under better regulation, a most unfavorable example
</p>
<p>of the character of their nation.
</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers of the garrisons did
</p>
<p>their full part in exciting the general resentment.
</p>
<p>Formerly, when the warriors came to the forts,
</p>
<p>they had been welcomed by the French with atten-
</p>
<p>tion and respect. The inconvenience which their
</p>
<p>presence occasioned had been disregarded, and
</p>
<p>their peculiarities overlooked. But now they were
</p>
<p>received with cold looks and harsh words from the
</p>
<p>officers, and with oaths, menaces, and sometimes
</p>
<p>blows, from the reckless and brutal soldiers.
</p>
<p>When, after their troublesome and intrusive fash-
</p>
<p>ion, they were lounging everywhere about the fort,
</p>
<p>or lazily reclining in the shadow of the walls,
</p>
<p>they were met with muttered ejaculations of impa
</p>
<p>tience, or abrupt orders to be gone, enforced, per-
</p>
<p>haps, by a touch from the butt of a sentinel's
</p>
<p>musket. These marks of contempt were un speak
</p>
<p>ably galling to their haughty spirit. 1
</p>
<p>1 Some of the principal causes of the war are exhibited vith spirit and
</p>
<p>truth in the old tragedy of Ponteach, written probably by Major Rogers.

</p>
<p>Reason to believe, by their Behavior, they intend to Cut us off en-

<p>power to Dispossess them and Recover it, if we will but Embrace the

</p>
<p>But what most contributed to the growing dis-
</p>
<p>content of the tribes was the intrusion of settlers
</p>
<p>upon their lands, at all times a fruitful source of
</p>
<p>Indian hostility. Its effects, it is true, could only
</p>
<p>be felt by those whose country bordered upon the
</p>
<p>English settlements ; but among these were the
</p>
<p>most powerful and influential of the tribes. The
</p>
<p>Delawares and Shawanoes, in particular, had by
</p>
<p>this time been roused to the highest pitch of exas-
</p>
<p>peration. , Their best lands had been invaded, and
</p>
<p>all remonstrance had been fruitless. They viewed
</p>
<p>with wrath and fear the steady progress of the
</p>
<p>white man, whose settlements had passed the Sus-
</p>
<p>quehanna, and were fast extending to the Allegha
</p>
<p>nies, eating away the forest like a spreading canker.
</p>
<p>The anger of the Delawares was abundantly shared
</p>
<p>by their ancient conquerors, the Six Nations. The
</p>
<p>threatened occupation of Wyoming by settlers from
</p>
<p>Connecticut gave great umbrage to the confederacy. 1
</p>
<p>The Senecas were more especially incensed at Eng-
</p>
<p>lish intrusion, since, from their position, they were
</p>
<p>farthest removed from the soothing influence of Sir
</p>
<p>William Johnson, and most exposed to the seduc-
</p>
<p>tions of the French ; while the Mohawks, another
</p>
<p>member of the confederacy, were justly alarmed at
</p>
<p>seeing the better part of their lands patented out
</p>
<p>without their consent. Some Christian Indians of
</p>
<p>the Oneida tribe, in the simplicity of their hearts,
</p>
<p>sent an earnest petition to Sir William Johnson,

</p>
<p>The discontent of the Indians gave great satis
</p>
<p>faction to the French, who saw in it an assurance
</p>
<p>of safe and bloody vengeance on their conquerors.
</p>
<p>Canada, it is true, was gone beyond hope of recov
</p>
<p>ery ; but they still might hope to revenge its loss.
</p>
<p>Interest, moreover, as well as passion, prompted
</p>
<p>them to inflame the resentment of the Indians ; for
</p>
<p>most of the inhabitants of the French settlements
</p>
<p>upon the lakes and the Mississippi were engaged
</p>
<p>in the fur-trade, and, fearing the English as formid-
</p>
<p>able rivals, they would gladly have seen them driven
</p>
<p>out of the country. Traders, habitans, coureurs de
</p>
<p>bois, and all classes of this singular population,
</p>
<p>accordingly dispersed themselves among the vil-
</p>
<p>lages of the Indians, or held councils with them in
</p>
<p>the secret places of the woods, urging them to take
</p>
<p>up arms against the English. They exhibited the
</p>
<p>conduct of the latter in its worst light, and spared
</p>
<p>neither misrepresentation nor falsehood. They told
</p>
<p>their excited hearers that the English had formed
</p>
<p>a deliberate scheme to root out the whole Indian
</p>
<p>race, and, with that design, had already begun to
</p>
<p>1 " We are now left in Peace, and have nothing to do but to plant our
</p>
<p>Corn, Hunt the wild Beasts, smoke our Pipes, and mind Religion. But
</p>
<p>as these Forts, which are built among us, disturb our Peace, & are a great
</p>
<p>hurt to Religion, because some of our Warriors are foolish, & some of our
</p>
<p>Brother Soldiers don't fear God, we therefore desire that these Forts may
</p>
<p>be pull'd down, & kick'd out of the way."
</p>
<p>At a conference at Philadelphia, in August, 1761, an Iroquois sachem
</p>
<p>gaid, " We, your Brethren of the several Nations, are penned up like
</p>
<p>Hoggs. There are Forts all around us, and therefore we are apprehensive
</p>
<p>that Death is coming upon us."

<p>a chain of forts on the other. Among other atro-
</p>
<p>cious plans for their destruction, they had instigated
</p>
<p>the Cherokees to attack and destroy the tribes of
</p>
<p>the Ohio valley. 1 These groundless calumnies
</p>
<p>found ready belief. The French declared, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion, that the King of France had of late years
</p>
<p>fallen asleep ; that, during his slumbers, the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish had seized upon Canada ; but that he was now
</p>
<p>awake again, and that his armies were advancing
</p>
<p>up the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi, to drive
</p>
<p>out the intruders from the country of his red chil-
</p>
<p>dren. To these fabrications was added the more
</p>
<p>substantial encouragement of arms, ammunition,
</p>
<p>clothing, and provisions, which the French trading
</p>
<p>companies, if not the officers of the crown, distrib-
</p>
<p>uted with a liberal hand. 2

</p>
<p>the representations of the French, were yet farther
</p>
<p>wrought upon by influences of another kind. A
</p>
<p>prophet rose among the Delawares. This man
</p>
<p>may serve as a counterpart to the famous Shawanoe
</p>
<p>prophet, who figured so conspicuously in the Indian
</p>
<p>outbreak, under Tecumseh, immediately before the
</p>
<p>war with England in 1812. Many other parallel
</p>
<p>instances might be shown, as the great suscepti-
</p>
<p>bility of the Indians to superstitious impressions
</p>
<p>renders the advent of a prophet among them no
</p>
<p>very rare occurrence. In the present instance, the
</p>
<p>inspired Delaware seems to have been rather an
</p>
<p>enthusiast than an impostor ; or perhaps he com-
</p>
<p>bined both characters. The objects of his mission
</p>
<p>were not wholly political. By means of certain
</p>
<p>external observances, most of them sufficiently friv
</p>
<p>olous and absurd, his disciples were to strengthen
</p>
<p>and purify their natures, and make themselves
</p>
<p>acceptable to the Great Spirit, whose messenger
</p>
<p>he proclaimed himself to be. He also enjoined
</p>
<p>them to lay aside the weapons and clothing which
</p>
<p>they received from the white men, and return to
</p>
<p>the primitive life of their ancestors. By so doing,
</p>
<p>and by strictly observing his other precepts, the
</p>
<p>tribes would soon be restored to their ancient great-
</p>
<p>ness and power, and be enabled to drive out the
</p>
<p>white men who infested their territory. The pro-
</p>
<p>phet had many followers. Indians came from far
</p>
<p>and near, and gathered together in large encamp-
</p>
<p>ments to listen to his exhortations. His fame
</p>
<p>spread even to the nations of the northern lakes ;

<p>It was determined to attack all the English forts

<p>182 ANGER OF THE INDIANS. UTCO-1763
</p>
<p>many of the Indians fondly believed, the English
</p>
<p>should all be driven into the sea, and the country
</p>
<p>restored to its primitive owners.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine which tribe was first
</p>
<p>to raise the cry of war. There were many who
</p>
<p>might have done so, for all the savages in the back-
</p>
<p>woods were ripe for an outbreak, and the movement
</p>
<p>seemed almost simultaneous. The Delawares and
</p>
<p>Senecas were the most incensed, and Kiashuta, a
</p>
<p>chief of the latter, was perhaps foremost to apply
</p>
<p>the torch ; but, if this was the case, he touched
</p>
<p>fire to materials already on the point of igniting.
</p>
<p>It belonged to a greater chief than he to give
</p>
<p>method and order to what would else have been a
</p>
<p>wild burst of fury, and convert desultory attacks
</p>
<p>into a formidable and protracted war. But for
</p>
<p>Pontiac, the whole might have ended in a few
</p>
<p>troublesome inroads upon the frontier, and a little
</p>
<p>whooping and yelling under the walls of Fort Pitt.
</p>
<p>Pontiac, as already mentioned, was principal
</p>
<p>chief of the Ottawas. The Ottawas, Ojibwas, and
</p>
<p>Pottawattamies, had long been united in a loose
</p>
<p>kind of confederacy, of which he was the virtual
</p>
<p>head. Over those around him his authority was
</p>
<p>almost despotic, and his power extended far beyond
</p>
<p>the limits of the three united tribes. His influence
</p>
<p>was great among all the nations of the Illinois
</p>
<p>country ; while, from the sources of the Ohio to
</p>
<p>those of the Mississippi, and, indeed, to the farthest
</p>
<p>boundaries of the wide-spread Algonquin race, his
</p>
<p>name was known and respected.

<p>The fact that Pontiac was born the son of a
</p>
<p>irea-i763.j rONTiAC. lbM
</p>
<p>chief would in no degree account for the extent of
</p>
<p>his power ; for, among Indians, many a chief's son
</p>
<p>sinks back into insignificance, while the offspring
</p>
<p>of a common warrior may succeed to his place.
</p>
<p>Among all the wild tribes of the continent, per-
</p>
<p>sonal merit is indispensable to gaining or preserving
</p>
<p>dignity. Courage, resolution, address, and elo-
</p>
<p>quence are sure passports to distinction. With
</p>
<p>all these Pontiac was pre-eminently endowed, and
</p>
<p>it was chiefly to them, urged to their highest
</p>
<p>activity by a vehement ambition, that he owed
</p>
<p>his greatness. He possessed a commanding energy
</p>
<p>and force of mind, and in subtlety and craft could
</p>
<p>match the best of his wily race. But, though
</p>
<p>capable of acts of magnanimity, he was a thorough
</p>
<p>savage, with a wider range of intellect than those
</p>
<p>around him, but sharing all their passions and
</p>
<p>prejudices, their fierceness and treachery. His
</p>
<p>faults were the faults of his race ; and they cannot
</p>
<p>eclipse his nobler qualities. His memory is still
</p>
<p>cherished among the remnants of many Algon-
</p>
<p>quin tribes, and the celebrated Tecurnseh adopted
</p>
<p>him for his model, proving himself no unworthy
</p>
<p>imitator. 1
</p>
<p>1 Drake, Life of Tecurnseh, 138.
</p>
<p>Several tribes, the Miamis, Sacs, and others, have claimed connection
</p>
<p>vith the great chief; but it is certain that he was, by adoption at least,
</p>
<p><2n Ottawa. Henry Conner, formerly government interpreter for the
</p>
<p>northern tribes, declared, on the faith of Indian tradition, that he was
</p>
<p>born among the Ottawas of an Ojibwa mother, a circumstance which
</p>
<p>proved an advantage to him by increasing his influence over both tribes.
</p>
<p>An Ojibwa Indian told the writer that some portion of his power was to
</p>
<p>be ascribed to his being a chief of the Metai, a magical association among
</p>
<p>the Indians of the lakes, in whict character he exerted an influence ou

</p>
<p>184 THE CONSPIRACY [17601763
</p>
<p>Portiac was now about fifty years old. Until
</p>
<p>Major Rogers came into the country, he had been,
</p>
<p>from motives probably both of interest and incli-
</p>
<p>nation, a firm friend of the French. Not long
</p>
<p>before the French war broke out, he had saved the
</p>
<p>garrison of Detroit from the imminent peril of an
</p>
<p>attack from some of the discontented tribes of the
</p>
<p>north. During the war, he had fought on the side
</p>
<p>of France. it is said that he commanded the
</p>
<p>Ottawas at the memorable defeat of Braddock ;
</p>
<p>and it is certain that he was treated with much
</p>
<p>honor by the French officers, and received especial
</p>
<p>marks of esteem from the Marquis of Montcalm. 1
</p>
<p>We have seen how, when the tide of affairs
</p>
<p>changed, the subtle and ambitious chief trimmed
</p>
<p>his bark to the current, and gave the hand of
</p>
<p>friendship to the English. That he was dis-
</p>
<p>appointed in their treatment of him, and in all
</p>
<p>the hopes that he had formed from their alliance,
</p>
<p>is sufficiently evident from one of his speeches
</p>
<p>A new light soon began to dawn upon his untaught
</p>
<p>but powerful mind, and he saw the altered posture
</p>
<p>of affairs under its true aspect.
</p>
<p>It was a momentous and gloomy crisis for the
</p>
<p>Indian race, for never before had they been exposed
</p>
<p>to such imminent and pressing danger. With the
</p>
<p>downfall of Canada, the tribes had sunk at once
</p>
<p>from their position of importance. Hitherto the
</p>
<p>two rival European nations had kept each other

</p>
<p>in check upon the American continent, and the
</p>
<p>Indians had, in some measure, held the balance of
</p>
<p>power between them. To conciliate their good
</p>
<p>will and gain their alliance, to avoid offending
</p>
<p>them by injustice and encroachment, was the
</p>
<p>policy both of the French and English. But now
</p>
<p>the face of affairs was changed. The English had
</p>
<p>gained an undisputed ascendency, and the Indians,
</p>
<p>no longer important as allies, were treated as mere
</p>
<p>barbarians, who might be trampled upon with im-
</p>
<p>punity. Abandoned to their own feeble resources
</p>
<p>and divided strength, they must fast recede, and
</p>
<p>dwindle away before the steady progress of the
</p>
<p>colonial power. Already their best hunting-
</p>
<p>grounds were invaded, and from the eastern
</p>
<p>ridges of the Alleghanies they might see, from
</p>
<p>far and near, the smoke of the settlers' clearings,
</p>
<p>rising in tall columns from the dark-green bosom
</p>
<p>of the forest. The doom of the race was sealed,
</p>
<p>and no human power could avert it ; but they, in
</p>
<p>their ignorance, believed otherwise, and vainly
</p>
<p>thought that, by a desperate effort, they might
</p>
<p>yet uproot and overthrow the growing strength
</p>
<p>of their destroyers.
</p>
<p>It would be idle to suppose that the great mass
</p>
<p>of the Indians understood, in its full extent, the
</p>
<p>danger which threatened their race. With them,
</p>
<p>the war was a mere outbreak of fury, and they
</p>
<p>turned against their enemies with as little reason
</p>
<p>or forecast as a panther when he leaps at the throat
</p>
<p>of the hunter. Goaded by wrongs and indignities,

<p>of the moment. But the mind of Pontine could
</p>
<p>embrace a wider and deeper view. The peril of
</p>
<p>the times was unfolded in its full extent before
</p>
<p>him, and he resolved to unite the tribes in one
</p>
<p>grand effort to avert it. He did not, like many
</p>
<p>of his people, entertain the absurd idea that the
</p>
<p>Indians, by their unaided strength, could drive
</p>
<p>the English into the sea. He adopted the only
</p>
<p>.: plan consistent with reason, that of restoring the
</p>
<p>French ascendency in the west, and once more
</p>
<p>N. opposing a check to British encroachment. With
</p>
<p>views like these, he lent a greedy ear to the
</p>
<p>plausible falsehoods of the Canadians, who assured
</p>
<p>him that the armies of King Louis were already
</p>
<p>advancing to recover Canada, and that the French
</p>
<p>and their red brethren, fighting side by side, would
</p>
<p>drive the English dogs back within their own
</p>
<p>narrow limits.
</p>
<p>Revolving these thoughts, and remembering that
</p>
<p>his own ambitious views might be advanced by the
</p>
<p>hostilities he meditated, Pontiac no longer hesitated
</p>
<p>Revenge, ambition, and patriotism wrought upon
</p>
<p>him alike, and he resolved on war. At the close
</p>
<p>of the year 1762, he sent ambassadors to the dif-
</p>
<p>ferent nations. They visited the country of the
</p>
<p>Ohio and its tributaries, passed northward to the
</p>
<p>region of the upper lakes, and the borders of
</p>
<p>the River Ottawa ; and far southward towards the
</p>
<p>mDuth of the Mississippi. 1 Bearing with them

<p>importance of the message demanded, and the toma-
</p>
<p>hawk stained red, in token of war, they went from
</p>
<p>camp to camp, and village to village. Wherever
</p>
<p>they appeared, the sachems and old men assembled,
</p>
<p>to hear the words of the great Pontiac. Then the
</p>
<p>chief of the embassy flimg down the tomahawk on
</p>
<p>the ground before them, and holding the war-belt
</p>
<p>in -his hand, delivered, with vehement gesture, word
</p>
<p>for word, the speech with which he was charged.
</p>
<p>It was heard everywhere with approval ; the belt
</p>
<p>was accepted, the hatchet snatched up, and the
</p>
<p>assembled chiefs stood pledged to take part in
</p>
<p>-the war. The blow was to be struck at a certain
</p>
<p>time in the month of May following, to be indicated
</p>
<p>by the changes of the moon. The tribes were to
</p>
<p>rise together, each destroying the English garrison
</p>
<p>in its neighborhood, and then, with a general rush,
</p>
<p>the whole were to turn against the settlements
</p>
<p>of the frontier.
</p>
<p>The tribes, thus banded together against the Eng-'
</p>
<p>lish, comprised, with a few unimportant exceptions,
</p>
<p>the whole Algonquin stock, to whom were united
</p>
<p>the Wyandots, the Senecas, and several tribes of
</p>
<p>the lower Mississippi. The Senecas were the only
</p>
<p>members of the Iroquois confederacy who joined

<p>in the league, the rest being kept quiet by the

<p>influence of Sir William Johnson, whose utmost

</p>
<p>exertions, however, were barely sufficient to allay
</p>
<p>their irritation. 1
</p>
<p>While thus on the very eve of an outbreak, the
</p>
<p>Indians concealed their designs with the dissimu-
</p>
<p>lation of their race. The warriors still lounged
</p>
<p>about the forts, with calm, impenetrable faces,
</p>
<p>begging, as usual, for tobacco, gunpowder, and
</p>
<p>whiskey. Now and then, some slight intimation
</p>
<p>)f danger would startle the garrisons from their
</p>
<p>ecurity. An English trader, coming in from the
</p>
<p>Indian villages, would report that, from their man-
</p>
<p>ner and behavior, he suspected them of brooding
</p>
<p>mischief; or some scoundrel half-breed would be
</p>
<p>heard boasting in his cups, that before next sum-
</p>
<p>mer he would have English hair to fringe his hunt-
</p>
<p>laces, collars, and embroidery ; but when employed for public purposes,
</p>
<p>they were disposed in a great variety of patterns and devices, which, to
</p>
<p>the minds of the Indians, had all the significance of hieroglyphics. An
</p>
<p>Indian orator, at every clause of his speech, delivered a belt or string of
</p>
<p>wampum, varying in size, according to the importance of what he had
</p>
<p>said, and, by its figures and coloring, so arranged as to perpetuate the
</p>
<p>remembrance of his words. These belts were carefully stored up like
</p>
<p>written documents, and it was generally the office of some old man to
</p>
<p>interpret their meaning.
</p>
<p>When a wampum belt was sent to summon the tribes to join in war, its
</p>
<p>cclor was always red or black, while the prevailing color of a peace-belt
</p>
<p>was white. Tobacco was sometimes used on such occasions as a substi-
</p>
<p>tute for wampum, since in their councils the Indians are in the habit of
</p>
<p>constantly smoking, and tobacco is therefore taken as the emblem of
</p>
<p>deliberation. With the tobacco or the belt of wampum, presents are not
</p>
<p>unfrequently sent to conciliate the good will of the tribe whose alliance ia
</p>
<p>gought. In the summer of the year 18-46, when the western bands of the
</p>
<p>Dahcotah were preparing to go in concert against their enemies the

<p>the writer was an inmate, impoverished himself by sending most of his
</p>
<p>horses as presents to the chiefs of the surrounding villages. On this

<p>occasion, tobacco was the token borne by the messengers, as wampum is

</p>
<p>discovered. Early in March, 1763, Ensign Holmes,
</p>
<p>commanding at Fort Miami, was told by a friendly
</p>
<p>Indian that the warriors in the neighboring village
</p>
<p>had lately received a war-belt, with a message urg-
</p>
<p>ing them to destroy him and his garrison, and that
</p>
<p>this they were preparing to do. Holmes called the
</p>
<p>Indians together, and boldly charged them with
</p>
<p>their design. They did as Indians on such occa-
</p>
<p>sions have often done, confessed their fault with
</p>
<p>much apparent contrition, laid the blame on a
</p>
<p>neighboring tribe, and professed eternal friendship
</p>
<p>to their brethren, the English. Holmes writes to
</p>
<p>report his discovery to Major Gladwyn, who, in his
</p>
<p>turn, sends the information to Sir Jeffrey Amherst,
</p>
<p>expressing his opinion that there has been a general
</p>
<p>irritation among the Indians, but that the affair will
</p>
<p>soon blow over, and that, in the neighborhood of

<p>his own post, the savages were perfectly tranquil.

<p>CHAPTER VIII.

<p>1763.
</p>
<p>INDIAN PREPARATION.
</p>
<p>I interrupt the progress of the narrative to
</p>
<p>glance for a moment at the Indians in their mili-
</p>
<p>tary capacity, and observe how far they were qual-
</p>
<p>ified to prosecute the formidable war into which
</p>
<p>they were about to plunge.
</p>
<p>A people living chiefly by the chase, and there-
</p>
<p>fore, of necessity, thinly and widely scattered ;
</p>
<p>divided into numerous tribes, held together by no
</p>
<p>strong principle of cohesion, and with no central
</p>
<p>government to combine their strength, could act
</p>
<p>with little efficiency against such an enemy as was
</p>
<p>now opposed to them. Loose and disjointed as a
</p>
<p>whole, the government even of individual tribes,
</p>
<p>and of their smallest separate communities, was too
</p>
<p>feeble to deserve the name. There were, it is true,
</p>
<p>chiefs whose office was in a manner hereditary ;
</p>
<p>but their authority was wholly of a moral nature,
</p>
<p>and enforced by no compulsory law. Their prov-
</p>
<p>ince was to advise, and not to command. Their
</p>
<p>influence, such as it was, is chiefly to be ascribed

<p>to the principle of hero-worship, natural to the

<p>192 INDIAN PREPARATION. [1765
</p>
<p>[ndian character, and to the reverence for age,
</p>
<p>which belongs to a state of society where a patri-
</p>
<p>archal element largely prevails. It was their office
</p>
<p>to declare war and make peace ; bat when war was
</p>
<p>declared, they had no power to carry the declara-
</p>
<p>tion into effect. The warriors fought if they chose
</p>
<p>to do so ; but if, on the contrary, they preferred to
</p>
<p>remain quiet, no man could force them to raise the
</p>
<p>hatchet. The war-chief, whose part it was to lead
</p>
<p>them to battle, was a mere partisan, whom his
</p>
<p>bravery and exploits had led to distinction. If he
</p>
<p>thought proper, he sang his war-song and danced
</p>
<p>his war-dance ; and as many of the young men as
</p>
<p>were disposed to follow him, gathered around and
</p>
<p>enlisted themselves under him. Over these volun-
</p>
<p>teers he had no legal authority, and they could
</p>
<p>desert him at any moment, with no other penalty
</p>
<p>than disgrace. When several war parties, of differ-
</p>
<p>ent bands or tribes, were united in a common en-
</p>
<p>terprise, their chiefs elected a leader, who was
</p>
<p>nominally to command the whole ; but unless this
</p>
<p>leader was a man of uncommon reputation and
</p>
<p>ability, his commands were disregarded, and his
</p>
<p>authority was a cipher. Among his followers,
</p>
<p>every latent element of discord, pride, jealousy,
</p>
<p>and ancient half-smothered feuds, were ready at
</p>
<p>any moment to break out, and tear the whole
</p>
<p>asunder. His warriors would often desert in bodies ;
</p>
<p>and many an Indian army, before reaching the
</p>
<p>enemy's country, has been known to dwindle away
</p>
<p>until it was reduced to a mere scalping party.

</p>
<p>as to form a permanent and effective army of such
</p>
<p>materials. The wild love of freedom, and impa
</p>
<p>tience of all control, which mark the Indian race,
</p>
<p>render them utterly intolerant of military discipline.
</p>
<p>Partly from their individual character, and partly
</p>
<p>from this absence of subordination, spring results
</p>
<p>highly unfavorable to continued and extended mil-
</p>
<p>itary operations. Indian warriors, when acting in
</p>
<p>large masses, are to the last degree wayward, ca-
</p>
<p>pricious, and unstable ; infirm of purpose as a mob
</p>
<p>of children, and devoid of providence and fore-
</p>
<p>sight. To provide supplies for a campaign forms
</p>
<p>no part of their system. Hence the blow must be
</p>
<p>struck at once, or not struck at all ; and to post-
</p>
<p>pone victory is to insure defeat. It is when acting
</p>
<p>in small, detached parties, that the Indian warrior
</p>
<p>puts forth his energies, and displays his admirable
</p>
<p>address, endurance, and intrepidity. It is then that
</p>
<p>he becomes a truly formidable enemy. Fired with
</p>
<p>the hope of winning scalps, he is stanch as a blood
</p>
<p>hound. No hardship can divert him from his
</p>
<p>purpose, and no danger subdne his patient and
</p>
<p>cautious courage.
</p>
<p>From their inveterate passion for war, the Indians
</p>
<p>are always prompt enough to engage in it ; and on
</p>
<p>the present occasion, the prevailing irritation gave
</p>
<p>ample assurance that they would not remain idle.
</p>
<p>While there was little risk that they would capture
</p>
<p>any strong and well-defended fort, or carry any
</p>
<p>important position, there was, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>every reason to apprehend wide-spread havoc, and
</p>
<p>a destructive war of detail. That the war might

</p>
<p>be carried on with effect, it was the part of the
</p>
<p>Indian leaders to work upon the passions of their
</p>
<p>people, and keep alive their irritation ; to whet
</p>
<p>their native appetite for blood and glory, and cheer
</p>
<p>them on to the attack  to guard against all that
</p>
<p>might quench their ardor, or cool their fierceness ;
</p>
<p>to avoid pitched battles ; never to fight except under
</p>
<p>advantage ; and to avail themselves of all the aid
</p>
<p>which craft and treachery could afford. The very
</p>
<p>circumstances which unfitted the Indians for con-
</p>
<p>tinued and concentrated attack were, in another
</p>
<p>view, highly advantageous, by preventing the enemy
</p>
<p>from assailing them with vital effect. It was no
</p>
<p>easy task to penetrate tangled woods in search of
</p>
<p>a foe, alert and active as a lynx, who would seldom
</p>
<p>stand and fight, whose deadly shot and triumphant
</p>
<p>whoop were the first and often the last tokens of
</p>
<p>his presence, and who, at the approach of a hostile
</p>
<p>force, would vanish into the black recesses of for-
</p>
<p>ests and pine swamps, only to renew his attacks
</p>
<p>with unabated ardor. There were no forts to cap
</p>
<p>ture, no magazines to destroy, and little property
</p>
<p>to seize upon. No warfare could be more perilous
</p>
<p>and harassing in its prosecution, or less satisfactory
</p>
<p>in its results.
</p>
<p>The English colonies at this time were hut ill
</p>
<p>fitted to bear the brunt of the impending war.
</p>
<p>The army which had conquered Canada was
</p>
<p>broken up and dissolved ; the provincials were
</p>
<p>disbanded, and most of the regulars sent home.

<p>by war and sickness, had just arrived from the
</p>
<p>.7C3J THE PEACE OF PARIS. 11)5
</p>
<p>West Indies ; and of these, several were already
</p>
<p>ordered to England, to be disbanded. There
</p>
<p>remained barely troops enough to furnish feeble
</p>
<p>garrisons for the various forts on the frontier and
</p>
<p>in the Indian country. 1 At the head of this dilapi-
</p>
<p>dated army was Sir Jeffrey Amherst, who had
</p>
<p>achieved the reduction of Canada, and clinched
</p>
<p>the nail which Wolfe had driven. In some
</p>
<p>respects he was well fitted for the emergency;
</p>
<p>but, on the other hand, he held the Indians in
</p>
<p>supreme contempt, and his arbitrary treatment of
</p>
<p>them and total want of every quality of concilia-
</p>
<p>tion where they were concerned, had had no little
</p>
<p>share in exciting them to war.
</p>
<p>While the war was on the eve of breaking out,
</p>
<p>an event occurred which had afterwards an impor
</p>
<p>tant effect upon its progress,  the signing of the
</p>
<p>treaty of peace at Paris, on the tenth of February,
</p>
<p>176-3. By this treaty France resigned her claims
</p>
<p>to the territories east of the Mississippi, and that
</p>
<p>great river now became the western boundary of
</p>
<p>the British colonial possessions. In portioning out
</p>
<p>her new acquisitions into separate governments,
</p>
<p>England left the valley of the Ohio and the adja
</p>
<p>cent regions as an Indian domain, and by the
</p>
<p>proclamation of the seventh of October following,
</p>
<p>the intrusion of settlers upon these lands was
</p>
<p>strictly prohibited. Could these just and neces-
</p>
<p>sary measures have been sooner adopted, it is
</p>
<p>probable that the Indian war might have been

<p>prevented, or, at all events, rendered less general
</p>
<p>and violent, for the treaty would have made it
</p>
<p>apparent that the French could never repossess
</p>
<p>themselves of Canada, and would have proved the
</p>
<p>futility of every hope which the Indians entertained
</p>
<p>of assistance from that quarter, while, at the same
</p>
<p>time, the royal proclamation would have tended to
</p>
<p>tranquillize their minds, by removing the chief
</p>
<p>cause of irritation. But the remedy came too late,
</p>
<p>and served only to inflame the evil. While the
</p>
<p>sovereigns of France, England, and Spain, were
</p>
<p>signing the treaty at Paris, countless Indian war-
</p>
<p>riors in the American forests were singing the
</p>
<p>war-song, and whetting their scalping-knives.
</p>
<p>Throughout the western wilderness, in a hundred
</p>
<p>camps and villages, were celebrated the savage rites
</p>
<p>of war. Warriors, women, and children were alike
</p>
<p>eager and excited ; magicians consulted their ora-
</p>
<p>cles, and prepared charms to insure success ; while
</p>
<p>the war-chief, his body painted black from head to
</p>
<p>foot, concealed himself in the solitude of rocks and
</p>
<p>caverns, or the dark recesses of the forest. Here,
</p>
<p>fasting and praying, he calls day and night upon
</p>
<p>the Great Spirit, consulting his dreams, to draw
</p>
<p>from them auguries of good or evil ; and if, per-
</p>
<p>chance, a vision of the great war-eagle seems to
</p>
<p>hover over him with expanded wings, he exults in
</p>
<p>the full conviction of triumph. When a few days
</p>
<p>have elapsed, he emerges from his retreat, and the
</p>
<p>people discover him descending from the woods,
</p>
<p>and approaching their camp, black as a demon of

<p>dock around and listen to his wild harangue. He
</p>
<p>calls on them to avenge the blood of their slaugh-
</p>
<p>tered relatives ; he assures them that the Great
</p>
<p>Spirit is on their side, and that victory is certain
</p>
<p>With exulting cries they disperse to their wigwams,
</p>
<p>to array themselves in the savage decorations of
</p>
<p>the war-dress. An old man now passes through
</p>
<p>the camp, and invites the warriors to a feast in the
</p>
<p>name of the chief. They gather from all quarters
</p>
<p>to his wigwam, where they find him seated, no
</p>
<p>longer covered with black, but adorned with the
</p>
<p>startling and fantastic blazonry of the war-paint.
</p>
<p>Those who join in the feast pledge themselves, by
</p>
<p>so doing, to follow him against the enemy. The
</p>
<p>guests seat themselves on the ground, in a circle
</p>
<p>around the wigwam, and the flesh of dogs is placed
</p>
<p>in wooden dishes before them, while the chief,
</p>
<p>though goaded by the pangs of his long, unbroken
</p>
<p>fast, sits smoking his pipe with unmoved counte-
</p>
<p>nance, and takes no part in the feast.
</p>
<p>Night has now closed in ; and the rough clear-
</p>
<p>ing is illumined by the blaze of fires and burning
</p>
<p>pine-knots, casting their deep red glare upon the
</p>
<p>dusky boughs of the surrounding forest, and upon
</p>
<p>the wild multitude who, fluttering with feathers
</p>
<p>and bedaubed with paint, have gathered for the
</p>
<p>celebration of the war-dance. A painted post is
</p>
<p>driven into the ground, and the crowd form a wide
</p>
<p>circle around it. The chief leaps into the vacant

<p>space, brandishing his hatchet as if rushing upon

<p>an enemy, and, in a loud, vehement tone, chants

<p>whoop, throwing himself into all the postures of
</p>
<p>actual fight, striking the post as if it were an
</p>
<p>enemy, and tearing the scalp from the head of the

<p>imaginary victim. Warrior after warrior follow?

<p>with sudden frenzy, rush together into the ring,

<p>leaping, stamping, and whooping, brandishing
</p>
<p>knives and hatchets in the fire-light, hacking and
</p>
<p>stabbing the air, and breaking at intervals into a
</p>
<p>burst of ferocious yells, which sounds for miles
</p>
<p>away over the lonely, midnight forest.
</p>
<p>In the morning, the warriors prepare to depart.
</p>
<p>They leave the camp in single file, still decorated
</p>
<p>with all their finery of paint, feathers, and scalp-
</p>
<p>locks ; and, as they enter the woods, the chief fires
</p>
<p>his gun, the warrior behind follows his example,
</p>
<p>and the discharges pass in slow succession from
</p>
<p>front to rear, the salute concluding with a general
</p>
<p>whoop. They encamp at no great distance from
</p>
<p>the village, and divest themselves of their much
</p>
<p>prized ornaments, which are carried back by the
</p>
<p>women, who have followed them for this purpose.
</p>
<p>The warriors pursue their journey, clad in the
</p>
<p>rough attire of hard service, and move silently and
</p>
<p>stealthily through the forest towards the hapless
</p>
<p>garrison, or defenceless settlement, which they
</p>
<p>have marked as their prey.

</p>
<p>hunter, weak and emaciated, would come in from
</p>
<p>the forest, and relate that his companions had been
</p>
<p>butchered in the Indian villages, and that he alone
</p>
<p>had escaped. Next succeeded vague and un-
</p>
<p>certain rumors of forts attacked and garrisons
</p>
<p>slaughtered ; and soon after, a report gained
</p>
<p>ground that every post throughout the Indian
</p>
<p>country had been taken, and every soldier killed.
</p>
<p>Close upon these tidings came the enemy himself.
</p>
<p>The Indian war-parties broke out of the woods
</p>
<p>like gangs of wolves, murdering, burning, and
</p>
<p>laying waste ; while hundreds of terror-stricken

<p>families, abandoning their homes, fled for refuge

</p>
<p>THE COUNCIL AT THE RIVER ECORCES.
</p>
<p>To begin the war was reserved by Pontiac as his
</p>
<p>own peculiar privilege. With the first opening of
</p>
<p>spring his preparations were complete. His light-
</p>
<p>footed messengers, with their wampum belts and
</p>
<p>gifts of tobacco, visited many a lonely hunting camp
</p>
<p>in the gloom of the northern woods, and called
</p>
<p>chiefs and warriors to attend the general meeting.
</p>
<p>The appointed spot was on the banks of the little
</p>
<p>River Ecorces, not far from Detroit. Thither went
</p>
<p>Pontiac himself, with his squaws and his children.
</p>
<p>Band after band came straggling in from every side,
</p>
<p>until the meadow was thickly dotted with their frail
</p>
<p>wigwams. 1 Here were idle warriors smoking and
</p>
<p>laughing in groups, or beguiling the lazy hours
</p>
<p>with gambling, feasting, or doubtful stories of their
</p>
<p>own martial exploits. Here were youthful gallants,
</p>
<p>bedizened with all the foppery of beads, feathers
</p>
<p>and hawks' bells, but held as yet in light esteem
</p>
<p>since they had slain no enemy, and taken no scalp

</p>
<p>Heie too were young damsels, radiant with bears
</p>
<p>oil, ruddy w r ith vermilion, and versed in all the
</p>
<p>arts of forest coquetry ; shrivelled hags, with limbs
</p>
<p>of wire, and the voices of screech-owls ; and troops
</p>
<p>of naked children, with small, black, mischievous
</p>
<p>eyes, roaming along the outskirts of the woods.
</p>
<p>The great Roman historian observes of the
</p>
<p>ancient Germans, that when summoned to a pub-
</p>
<p>lic meeting, they would lag behind the appointed
</p>
<p>time in order to show their independence. The
</p>
<p>remark holds true, and perhaps with greater
</p>
<p>emphasis, of the American Indians ; and thus it
</p>
<p>happened, that several days elapsed before the
</p>
<p>assembly was complete. In such a motley con-
</p>
<p>course of barbarians, where different bands and
</p>
<p>different tribes were mustered on one common
</p>
<p>camp ground, it would need all the art of a pru-
</p>
<p>dent leader to prevent their dormant jealousies
</p>
<p>from starting into open strife. No people are
</p>
<p>more prompt to quarrel, and none more prone, in
</p>
<p>the fierce excitement of the present, to forget the
</p>
<p>purpose of the future ; yet, through good fortune,
</p>
<p>or the wisdom of Pontiac, no rupture occurred;
</p>
<p>and at length the last loiterer appeared, and farther
</p>
<p>delay was needless.
</p>
<p>The council took place on the twenty-seventh
</p>
<p>of April. On that morning, several old men, the
</p>
<p>heralds of the camp, passed to and fro among
</p>
<p>the lodges, calling the warriors, in a loud voice,
</p>
<p>to attend the meeting.
</p>
<p>In accordance with the summons, they issued

<p>stems were lighted, and passed from hand to hand.
</p>
<p>Then Pontiac rose, and walked forward into the
</p>
<p>midst of the council. According to Canadian tra-
</p>
<p>dition, he was not above the middle height, though
</p>
<p>his muscular figure was cast in a mould of remark-
</p>
<p>able symmetry and vigor. His complexion was
</p>
<p>darker than is usual with his race, and his features,
</p>
<p>though by no means regular, had a bold and stern
</p>
<p>expression ; while his habitual bearing was impe
</p>
<p>rious and peremptory, like that of a man accus-
</p>
<p>tomed to sweep away all opposition by the force
</p>
<p>of his impetuous will. His ordinary attire was that
</p>
<p>of the primitive savage,  a scanty cincture girt
</p>
<p>about his loins, and his long, black hair flowing
</p>
<p>loosely at his back ; but on occasions like this
</p>
<p>he was wont to appear as befitted his power
</p>
<p>and character, and he stood doubtless before the
</p>
<p>council plumed and painted in the full costume

<p>of war.

</p>
<p>ejaculations of assent and approval responded to
</p>
<p>his words. He inveighed against the arrogance,
</p>
<p>rapacity, and injustice, of the English, and con-
</p>
<p>trasted them with the French, whom they had
</p>
<p>driven from the soil. He declared that the British
</p>
<p>commandant had treated him with neglect and
</p>
<p>contempt ; that the soldiers of the garrison had
</p>
<p>abused the Indians ; and that one of them had
</p>
<p>struck a follower of his own. He represented the
</p>
<p>danger that would arise from the supremacy of
</p>
<p>the English. They had expelled the French, and
</p>
<p>now they only waited for a pretext to turn upon
</p>
<p>the Indians and destroy them. Then, holding out
</p>
<p>a broad belt of wampum, he told the council that
</p>
<p>he had received it from their great father the King
</p>
<p>of France, in token that he had heard the voice of
</p>
<p>his red children ; that his sleep was at an end ;
</p>
<p>and that his great war canoes would soon sail up
</p>
<p>the St. Lawrence, to win back Canada, and wreak
</p>
<p>vengeance on his enemies. The Indians and their
</p>
<p>French brethren would fight once more side by
</p>
<p>side, as they had always fought ; they would
</p>
<p>strike the English as they had struck them many
</p>
<p>moons ago, when their great army marched down
</p>
<p>the Monongahela, and they had shot them from
</p>
<p>their ambush, like a flock of pigeons in the
</p>
<p>woods.
</p>
<p>Having roused in his warlike listeners their
</p>
<p>native thirst for blood and vengeance, he next

<p>to determine. It is possible that the Delaware
</p>
<p>prophet, mentioned in a former chapter, may have
</p>
<p>had some part in it ; or it might have been the
</p>
<p>offspring of Pontiac's heated imagination, during
</p>
<p>his period of fasting and dreaming. That he
</p>
<p>deliberately invented it for the sake of the effect
</p>
<p>it would produce, is the least probable conclusion
</p>
<p>of all ; for it evidently proceeds from the supersti-
</p>
<p>tious mind of an Indian, brooding upon the evil
</p>
<p>days in which his lot was cast, and turning for
</p>
<p>relief to the mysterious Author of his being. It is,
</p>
<p>at all events, a characteristic specimen of the
</p>
<p>Indian legendary tales, and, like many of them
</p>
<p>bears an allegoric significancy. Yet he who
</p>
<p>endeavors to interpret an Indian allegory through
</p>
<p>all its erratic windings and puerile inconsistencies,
</p>
<p>has undertaken no enviable task.
</p>
<p>" A Delaware Indian," said Pontiac, " conceived
</p>
<p>an eager desire to learn wisdom from the Master
</p>
<p>of Life ; but, being ignorant where to find him, he
</p>
<p>had recourse to fasting, dreaming, and magical
</p>
<p>incantations. By these means it was revealed to
</p>
<p>him, that, by moving forward in a straight, unde
</p>
<p>viating course, he would reach the abode of the
</p>
<p>Great Spirit. He told his purpose to no one, and
</p>
<p>having provided the equipments of a hunter, 
</p>
<p>gun, powder-horn, ammunition, and a kettle for
</p>
<p>preparing his food,  he set out on his errand.
</p>
<p>For some time he journeyed on in high hope and
</p>
<p>confidence. On the evening of the eighth day, he

<p>evening meal, when, looking up, he saw three
</p>
<p>large openings in the woods before him, and three
</p>
<p>well-beaten paths which entered them. He was
</p>
<p>much surprised ; but his wonder increased, when,
</p>
<p>after it had grown dark, the three paths were more
</p>
<p>clearly visible than ever. Remembering the impor-
</p>
<p>tant object of his journey, he could neither rest no*
</p>
<p>sleep ; and, leaving his fire, he crossed the meadow,
</p>
<p>and entered the largest of the three openings. lie
</p>
<p>had advanced but a short distance into the forest,
</p>
<p>when a bright flame sprang out of the ground
</p>
<p>before him, and arrested his steps. In great amaze-
</p>
<p>ment, he turned back, and entered the second path,
</p>
<p>where the same wonderful phenomenon again
</p>
<p>encountered him ; and now, in terror and bewilder-
</p>
<p>ment, yet still resolved to persevere, he took the
</p>
<p>last of the three paths. On this he journeyed a
</p>
<p>whole day without interruption, when at length,
</p>
<p>emerging from the forest, he saw before him a vast
</p>
<p>mountain, of dazzling whiteness. So precipitous
</p>
<p>was the ascent, that the Indian thought it hopeless
</p>
<p>to go farther, and looked around him in despair :
</p>
<p>at that moment, he saw, seated at some distance
</p>
<p>above, the figure of a beautiful woman arrayed in
</p>
<p>white, who arose as he looked upon her, and thus
</p>
<p>accosted him : ' How can you hope, encumbered

</p>
<p>and again began to ascend among the rocks, while
</p>
<p>the woman, seeing him still discouraged, laughed
</p>
<p>at his faintness of heart, and told him that, if he
</p>
<p>wished for success, he must climb by the aid *of
</p>
<p>one hand and one foot only. After great toil and
</p>
<p>suffering, he at length found himself at the summit.
</p>
<p>The woman had disappeared, and he was left alone.
</p>
<p>A rich and beautiful plain lay before him, and at
</p>
<p>a little distance he saw three great villages, far
</p>
<p>superior to the squalid wigwams of the Delawares.
</p>
<p>As he approached the largest, and stood hesitating
</p>
<p>whether he should enter, a man gorgeously attired
</p>
<p>stepped forth, and, taking him by the hand, wel-
</p>
<p>comed him to the celestial abode. He then con
</p>
<p>ducted him into the presence of the Great Spirit,
</p>
<p>where the Indian stood confounded at the unspeak-
</p>
<p>able splendor which surrounded him. The Great
</p>
<p>Spirit bade him be seated, and thus addressed
</p>
<p>him : 
</p>
<p>" ' I am the Maker of heaven and earth, the trees,
</p>
<p>lakes, rivers, and all things else. I am the Maker
</p>
<p>of mankind ; and because I love you, you must do

<p>for you, and not for others. Why do you suffer

<p>you have forgotten the customs and traditions of
</p>
<p>your forefathers. Why do you not clothe yourselves

</p>
<p>are your brethren. They are very dear to me, for

<p>they love the red men, and understand the true

<p>mode of worshipping me.' "
</p>
<p>The Great Spirit next gave his hearer various
</p>
<p>precepts of morality and religion, such as the
</p>
<p>prohibition to marry more than one wife ; and a
</p>
<p>warning against the practice of magic, which is
</p>
<p>worshipping the devil. A prayer, embodying the
</p>
<p>substance of all that he had heard, was then pre-
</p>
<p>sented to the Delaware. It was cut in hieroglyph-
</p>
<p>ics upon a w r ooden stick, after the custom of his
</p>
<p>people ; and he was directed to send copies of it tc
</p>
<p>all the Indian villages. 1
</p>
<p>The adventurer now departed, and, returning to
</p>
<p>the eaith, reported all the wonders he had seen in

<p>the celestial regions.

<p>and it is worthy of notice, that not he alone, but
</p>
<p>many of the most notable men who have arisen
</p>
<p>among the Indians, have been opponents of civili-
</p>
<p>zation, and stanch advocates of primitive barbarism.

</p>
<p>brought back their people to the rude simplicity of

</p>
<p>sive in the rigid, inflexible nature of an Indian.
</p>
<p>He will not open his mind to the idea of im-
</p>
<p>provement ; and nearly every change that has
</p>
<p>been forced upon him has been a change for the
</p>
<p>worse.
</p>
<p>Many other speeches were doubtless made in the
</p>
<p>council, but no record of them has been preserved.
</p>
<p>All present were eager to attack the British fort ;
</p>
<p>and Pontiac told them, in conclusion, that on the
</p>
<p>second of May he would gain admittance, with a
</p>
<p>party of his warriors, on pretence of dancing the
</p>
<p>calumet dance before the garrison ; that they would
</p>
<p>take note of the strength of the fortification ; and
</p>
<p>that he would then summon another council to
</p>
<p>determine the mode of attack.
</p>
<p>The assembly now dissolved, and all the evening
</p>
<p>the women were employed in loading the canoes,
</p>
<p>which were, drawn up on the bank of the stream.
</p>
<p>The encampments broke up at so early an hour,
</p>
<p>that when the sun rose, the savage swarm had
</p>
<p>melted away ; the secluded scene was restored to
</p>

</p>
<p>of numberless fires mingled their dark smoke with
</p>
<p>the white mist which rose from the little river.
</p>
<p>Every spring, after the winter hunt was over, the
</p>
<p>Indians were accustomed to return to their villages,
</p>
<p>or permanent encampments, in the vicinity of De-
</p>
<p>troit ; and, accordingly, after the council had broken
</p>
<p>up, they made their appearance as usual about the
</p>
<p>fort. On the first of May, Pontiac came to the
</p>
<p>gate with forty men of the Ottawa tribe, and asked
</p>
<p>permission to enter and dance the calumet dance,
</p>
<p>before the officers of the garrison. After some
</p>
<p>hesitation, he was admitted ; and proceeding to the
</p>
<p>corner of the street, where stood the house of the
</p>
<p>commandant, Major Gladwyn, he and thirty of his
</p>
<p>warriors began their dance, each recounting his
</p>
<p>own exploits, and boasting himself the bravest
</p>
<p>of mankind. The officers and men gathered around
</p>
<p>them ; while, in the mean time, the remaining ten
</p>
<p>of the Ottawas strolled about the fort, observing
</p>
<p>every thing it contained. When the dance was
</p>
<p>over, they all quietly withdrew, not a suspicion of
</p>
<p>their designs having arisen in the minds of the
</p>
<p>English. 1
</p>
<p>After a few days had elapsed, Pontiac's messen-
</p>
<p>gers again passed among the Indian cabins, calling
</p>
<p>the principal chiefs to another council, in the Pot-
</p>
<p>tawattamie village. Here there was a large struct

</p>
<p>centre shedding its fitful light upon their dark,
</p>
<p>naked forms, while the pipe passed from hand to
</p>
<p>hand. To prevent interruption, Pontiac had sta-
</p>
<p>tioned young men as sentinels, near the house- He
</p>
<p>once more addressed the chiefs ; inciting them to
</p>
<p>hostility against the English, and concluding by the
</p>
<p>proposal of his plan for destroying Detroit. It
</p>
<p>was as follows : Pontiac would demand a council
</p>
<p>with the commandant concerning matters of great
</p>
<p>importance ; and on this pretext he flattered him-
</p>
<p>self that he and his principal chiefs would gain
</p>
<p>ready admittance within the fort. They were all
</p>
<p>to carry weapons concealed beneath their blankets.
</p>
<p>While in the act of addressing the commandant in
</p>
<p>the council-room, Pontiac was to make a certain
</p>
<p>signal, upon which the chiefs were to raise the
</p>
<p>war-whoop, rush upon the officers present, and
</p>
<p>strike them down. The other Indians, waiting
</p>
<p>meanwhile at the gate, or loitering among the
</p>
<p>houses, on hearing the yells and firing within the
</p>
<p>building, were to assail the astonished and half-
</p>
<p>armed soldiers ; and thus Detroit would fall an
</p>
<p>easy prey.
</p>
<p>In opening this plan of treachery, Pontiac
</p>
<p>spoke rather as a counsellor than as a commander.
</p>
<p>Haughty as he was, he had too much sagacity to
</p>
<p>wound the pride of a body of men over whom he
</p>
<p>had no other control than that derived from his
</p>
<p>personal character and influence. No one was

<p>To the credulity of mankind each great calamity
</p>
<p>has its dire prognostics. Signs and portents in the
</p>
<p>heavens, the vision of an Indian bow, and the fig-
</p>
<p>ure of a scalp imprinted on the disk of the moon,
</p>
<p>warned the New England Puritans of impending
</p>
<p>war. The apparitions passed away, and Philip of
</p>
<p>Mount Hope burst from the forest with his Narra-
</p>
<p>gansett warriors. In October, 1762, thick clouds
</p>
<p>of inky blackness gathered above the fort and
</p>
<p>settlement of Detroit. The river darkened beneath
</p>
<p>the awful shadows, and the forest was wrapped in
</p>
<p>double gloom. Drops of rain began to fall, of
</p>
<p>strong, sulphurous odor, and so deeply colored

<p>that the people, it is said, collected them and used

<p>them for writing. 1 A literary and philosophical

<p>1768, Mat.] THE FORT. 2 13
</p>
<p>forebodings of impending evil disturbed the breast
</p>
<p>of many a timorous matron.
</p>
<p>La Motte-Cadillac was the founder of Detroit. In
</p>
<p>the year 1701, he planted the little military colony,
</p>
<p>which time has transformed into a thriving American
</p>
<p>city. 1 At an earlier date, some feeble efforts had
</p>
<p>been made to secure the possession of this impor
</p>
<p>tant pass ; and when La Hontan visited the lakes,
</p>
<p>a small post, called Fort St. Joseph, was standing
</p>
<p>near the present site of Fort Gratiot. The wan
</p>
<p>dering Jesuits, too, made frequent sojourns upon
</p>
<p>the borders of the Detroit, and baptized the savage
</p>
<p>children whom they found there.
</p>
<p>Fort St. Joseph was abandoned in the year 1688.
</p>
<p>The establishment of Cadillac was destined to a
</p>
<p>better fate, and soon rose to distinguished impor-
</p>
<p>tance among the western outposts of Canada.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the site was formed by nature for pros
</p>
<p>perity ; and a bad government and a thriftless
</p>
<p>people could not prevent the increase of the
</p>
<p>colony. At the close of the French war, as Major
</p>
<p>Rogers tells us, the place contained twenty-five
</p>
<p>hundred inhabitants. 2 The centre of the settle-
</p>
<p>ment was the fortified town, currently called the
</p>
<p>Fort, to distinguish it from the straggling dwellings
</p>

<p>214 DETROIT. [1763, Mat.
</p>
<p>Both above and below the fort, the banks of the
</p>
<p>stream were lined on both sides with small Cana-
</p>
<p>dian dwellings, extending at various intervals for
</p>
<p>nearly eight miles. Each had its garden and its
</p>
<p>orchard, and each was enclosed by a fence of
</p>
<p>rounded pickets. To the soldier or the trader,
</p>
<p>fresh from the harsh scenery and ambushed perib
</p>
<p>of the surrounding wilds, the secluded settlement
</p>
<p>was welcome as an oasis in the desert.
</p>
<p>The Canadian is usually a happy man. Life
</p>
<p>sits lightly upon him ; he laughs at its hardships,
</p>
<p>and soon forgets its sorrows. A lover of roving
</p>
<p>and adventure, of the frolic and the dance, he is
</p>
<p>little troubled with thoughts of the past or the
</p>
<p>future, and little plagued with avarice or ambition.
</p>
<p>At Detroit, all his propensities found ample scope.
</p>
<p>Aloof from the world, the simple colonists shared
</p>
<p>none of its pleasures and excitements, and were
</p>
<p>free from many of its cares. Nor were luxuries
</p>
<p>wanting which civilization might have envied them.
</p>
<p>The forests teemed with game, the marshes with
</p>
<p>wild fowl, and the rivers with fish. The apples
</p>
<p>and pears of the old Canadian orchards are even to
</p>
<p>this day held in esteem. The poorer inhabitants
</p>
<p>made wine from the fruit of the wild grape, which
</p>
<p>grew profusely in the woods, while the wealthier
</p>
<p>class procured a better quality from Montreal, in
</p>
<p>exchange for the canoe loads of furs which they
</p>
<p>sent down with every year. Here, as elsewhere in
</p>
<p>Canada, the long winter was a season of social
</p>
<p>enjoyment ; and when, in summer and autumn, the

<p>half-breeds, gathered from the distant forests of
</p>
<p>the north-west, the whole settlement was alive
</p>
<p>with dancing and feasting, drinking, gaming, and
</p>
<p>carousing.
</p>
<p>Within the limits of the settlement were three
</p>
<p>large Indian villages. On the western shore, a
</p>
<p>little below the fort, were the lodges of the Potta-
</p>
<p>wattamies ; nearly opposite, on the eastern side,
</p>
<p>was the village of the Wyandots ; and on the
</p>
<p>same side, five miles higher up, Pontiac's band of
</p>
<p>Ottawas had fixed their abode. The settlers had
</p>
<p>always maintained the best terms with their savage
</p>
<p>neighbors. In truth, there was much congeniality
</p>
<p>between the red man and the Canadian. Their
</p>
<p>harmony was seldom broken ; and among the
</p>
<p>woods and wilds of the northern lakes roamed
</p>
<p>many a lawless half-breed, the mongrel offspring of
</p>
<p>the colonists of Detroit and the Indian squaws.
</p>
<p>We have already seen how, in an evil hour for
</p>
<p>the Canadians, a party of British troops took pos-
</p>
<p>session of Detroit, towards the close of the year
</p>
<p>1 760. The British garrison, consisting partly of
</p>
<p>regulars and partly of provincial rangers, was now
</p>
<p>quartered in a well-built range of barracks within
</p>
<p>the town or fort. The latter, as already mentioned,
</p>
<p>contained about a hundred small houses. Its form
</p>
<p>was nearly square, and the palisade which sur-
</p>
<p>rounded it was about twenty-five feet high. At
</p>
<p>each corner was a wooden bastion, and a block-
</p>
<p>house was erected over each gateway. The houses
</p>
<p>were small, chiefly built of wood, and roofed with

</p>
<p>216 DETROIT. 11763, Mat
</p>
<p>were extremely narrow, though a wide passage
</p>
<p>way, known as the chemin du ronde, surrounded
</p>
<p>the town, between the houses and the palisade.
</p>
<p>Besides the barracks, the only public buildings
</p>
<p>were a council-house and a rude little church.
</p>
<p>The garrison consisted of a hundred and twenty
</p>
<p>soldiers, with about forty fur-traders and engages;
</p>
<p>but the latter, as well as the Canadian inhabitants
</p>
<p>of the place, could little be trusted, in the event of
</p>
<p>an Indian outbreak. Two small, armed schooners,
</p>
<p>the Beaver and the Gladwyn, lay anchored in the
</p>
<p>stream, and several light pieces of artillery were
</p>
<p>mounted on the bastions.
</p>
<p>Such was Detroit,  a place whose defences
</p>
<p>could have opposed no resistance to a civilized
</p>
<p>enemy ; and yet, far removed as it was from the
</p>
<p>hope of speedy succor, it could only rely, in the
</p>
<p>terrible struggles that awaited it, upon its own
</p>
<p>slight strength and feeble resources. 1
</p>
<p>Standing on the water bastion of Detroit, a
</p>
<p>pleasant landscape spread before the eye. The
</p>
<p>river, about half a mile wide, almost washed the

<p>foot of the stockade ; and either bank was lined

<p>with the white Canadian cottages. The joyous

</p>
<p>looking out from the foliage ; and, in the distance,
</p>
<p>the Indian wigwams curling their smoke against
</p>
<p>the sky,  all were mingled in one broad scene of
</p>
<p>wild and rural beauty.
</p>
<p>Pontiac, the Satan of this forest paradise, was
</p>
<p>accustomed to spend the early part of the summer
</p>
<p>upon a small island at the opening of the Lake St,
</p>
<p>Clair, hidden from view by the high woods that
</p>
<p>covered the intervening Isle au Cochon. 1 " The
</p>
<p>king and lord of all this country," as Ilogers calls
</p>
<p>him, lived in no royal state. His cabin was a
</p>
<p>small, oven-shaped structure of bark and rushes.
</p>
<p>Here he dwelt, with his squaws and children ; and
</p>
<p>here, doubtless, he might often have been seen,
</p>
<p>lounging, half-naked, on a rush mat, or a bear-
</p>
<p>skin, like any ordinary warrior. We may fancy
</p>
<p>the current of his thoughts, the turmoil of his
</p>
<p>uncurbed passions, as he revolved the treacheries
</p>
<p>which, to his savage mind, seemed fair and honor-
</p>
<p>able. At one moment, his tierce heart would burn
</p>
<p>with the anticipation of vengeance on the detested
</p>
<p>English ; at another, he would meditate how he
</p>
<p>best might turn the approaching tumults to the
</p>
<p>furtherance of his own ambitious schemes. Yet
</p>
<p>w T e may believe that Pontiac was not a stranger to
</p>
<p>the high emotion of the patriot hero, the champion
</p>
<p>not merely of his nation's rights, but of the very
</p>
<p>existence of his race. He did not dream how
</p>
<p>desperate a game he was about to play. He

<p>hourly flattered himself with the futile hope of
</p>
<p>aid from France, and thought in his ignorance thai
</p>
<p>the British colonies must give way before the rush
</p>
<p>of his savage warriors ; when, in truth, all the
</p>
<p>combined tribes of the forest might have chafed in
</p>
<p>vain rage against the rock-like strength of the
</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon.
</p>
<p>Looking across an intervening arm of the river,
</p>
<p>Pontiac could see on its eastern bank the numerous
</p>
<p>lodges of his Ottawa tribesmen, half hidden among
</p>
<p>the ragged growth of trees and bushes. On the
</p>
<p>afternoon of the fifth of May, a Canadian woman,
</p>
<p>the wife of St. Aubin, one of the principal settlers,
</p>
<p>crossed over from the western side, and visited the
</p>
<p>Ottawa village, to obtain from the Indians a supply
</p>
<p>of maple sugar and venison. She was surprised at
</p>
<p>finding several of the warriors engaged in filing
</p>
<p>off the muzzles of their guns, so as to reduce them,
</p>
<p>stock and all, to the length of about a yard. Re-
</p>
<p>turning home in the evening, she mentioned what
</p>
<p>she had seen to several of her neighbors. Upon
</p>
<p>this, one of them, the blacksmith of the village,
</p>
<p>remarked that many of the Indians had lately
</p>
<p>visited his shop, and attempted to bonow files
</p>
<p>and saws for a purpose which they would not
</p>
<p>explain. 1 These circumstances excited the suspi-
</p>
<p>cion of the experienced Canadians. Doubtless
</p>
<p>there were many in the settlement who might, had
</p>
<p>they chosen, have revealed the plot ; but it is no

<p>class in the little community had too deep an inter-
</p>
<p>est in the preservation of peace, to countenance
</p>
<p>the designs of Pontiac. M. Gouin, an old and
</p>
<p>wealthy settler, went to the commandant, and con
</p>
<p>jured him to stand upon his guard ; but Gladwyn,
</p>
<p>a man of fearless temper, gave no heed to the
</p>
<p>friendly advice. 1
</p>
<p>In the Pottawattamie village, if there be truth in
</p>
<p>tradition, lived an Ojibwa girl, who could boast a
</p>
<p>larger share of beauty than is common in the wig-
</p>
<p>wam. She had attracted the eye of Gladwyn. He
</p>
<p>had formed a connection with her, and she had be-
</p>
<p>come much attached to him. On the afternoon of
</p>
<p>the sixth, Catharine  for so the officers called her
</p>
<p> came to the fort, and repaired to Gladwyn's quar-
</p>
<p>ters, bringing with her a pair of elk-skin moccasons,
</p>
<p>ornamented with porcupine work, which he had
</p>
<p>requested her to make. There was something
</p>
<p>unusual in her look and manner. Her face was
</p>
<p>sad and downcast. She said little, and soon left
</p>
<p>the room ; but the sentinel at the door saw her still
</p>
<p>lingering at the street corner, though the hour for
</p>
<p>closing the gates was nearly come. At length she
</p>
<p>attracted the notice of Gladwyn himself; and
</p>
<p>calling her to him, he pressed her to declare what
</p>
<p>was weighing upon her mind. Still she remained
</p>
<p>for a long time silent, and it was only after much,
</p>
<p>urgency and many promises not to betray her, that
</p>
<p>she revealed her momentous secret.
</p>
<p>To-morrow, she said, Pontiac will come to the

<p>1 Letter to the writer from II. R. Schoolcraft, Esq., containing the
</p>
<p>traditional account from the lips of the interpreter, Henry Conner. See,
</p>
<p>also, Carver, Travels, 155 (Lond. 1778).
</p>
<p>Carver's account of the conspiracy and the siege is in several points
</p>
<p>inexact, which throws a shade of doubt on this story. Tradition, how-
</p>
<p>ever, as related by the interpreter Conner, sustains him : with the addi-
</p>
<p>tion that Catharine was the mistress of Gladwyn, and a few other points,
</p>
<p>including a very unromantic end of the heroine, who is said to have per-
</p>
<p>ished, by falling, when drunk, into a kettle of boiling maple-sap. This
</p>
<p>was many years after (see Appendix). Maxwell agrees in the main
</p>
<p>with Carver. There is another tradition, that the plot was disclosed by
</p>
<p>gn old squaw. A third, current among the Ottawas, and sent to me in
</p>
<p>185b by Mr. Ilosmer, of Toledo, declares that a young squaw told the plot
</p>
<p>to the commanding officer, but that he would not believe her, as she had a
</p>
<p>bad name, being a "straggler among the private soldiers." An Indian
</p>
<p>chief, pursues the same story, afterwards warned the officer. The Pontiac
</p>
<p>MS says that Gladwyn was warned by an Ottawa warrior, though a
</p>
<p>woman was suspected by the Indians of having betrayed the secret. Pel-
</p>
<p>tier says that a woman named Catharine was accused of revealing the
</p>
<p>plot, and severely flogged by Pontiac in consequence. There is anotli3i
</p>
<p>story, that a soldier named Tucker, adopted by the Indians, was warned
</p>
<p>by his Indian sister. But the most distinct and satisfactory evidence ii

<p>papers of Colonel John Brodhead, in the library of the Historical Society
</p>
<p>of Pennsylvania: "About six o'clock that afternoon [May 7J, six of
</p>
<p>their warriors returned and brought an old squaw prisoner, alleging that
</p>
<p>she had given us false information against them. The major declared
</p>
<p>she had never given us any kind of advice. They then insisted on
</p>
<p>naming the author of what he had heard with regard to the Indians,
</p>
<p>which he declined to do. but told them that it was one of themselves.
</p>
<p>1763, Mat.] A NIGHT OF ANXIETY. 22\
</p>
<p>Such is the story told in 1768 to the traveller
</p>
<p>Carver at Detroit, and preserved in local tradition,
</p>
<p>but not sustained by contemporary letters or diaries.
</p>
<p>What is certain is, that Gladwyn received secret
</p>
<p>information, on the night of the sixth of May, that
</p>
<p>an attempt would be made on the morrow to cap-
</p>
<p>ture the fort by treachery. He called some of his
</p>
<p>officers, and told them what he had heard. The
</p>
<p>defences of the place were feeble and extensive,
</p>
<p>and the garrison by far too weak to repel a general
</p>
<p>assault. The force of the Indians at this time is
</p>
<p>variously estimated at from six hundred to two
</p>
<p>thousand ; and the commandant greatly feared that
</p>
<p>some wild impulse might precipitate their plan,
</p>
<p>and that they would storm the fort before the morn-
</p>
<p>ing. Every preparation was made to meet the
</p>
<p>sudden emergency. Half the garrison were ordered
</p>
<p>under arms, and all the officers prepared to spend
</p>
<p>the night upon the ramparts.
</p>
<p>The day closed, and the hues of sunset faded.
</p>
<p>Only a dusky redness lingered in the west, and
</p>
<p>the darkening earth seemed her dull self again.
</p>
<p>Then night descended, heavy and black, on the
</p>
<p>whose name he promised never to reveal ; whereupon they went off, and
</p>
<p>carried the old woman prisoner with them. When they arrived at their
</p>
<p>camp, Pontiac, their greatest chief, seized on the prisoner, and gave her
</p>
<p>three strokes with a stick on the head, which laid her flat on the ground,
</p>
<p>and the whole nation assembled round her, and called repeated times,
</p>
<p>'Kill her! kill her !'"
</p>
<p>Thus it is clear that the story told by Carver must be taken with
</p>
<p>many grains of allowance. The greater part of the evidence given above
</p>
<p>has been gathered since the first edition of this book was published. It
</p>
<p>has been thought best to retain the original passage, with the necessary
</p>
<p>qualifications. The story is not without interest, and those may believe

<p>why, with such unwonted vigilance, their officers

<p>The night passed without alarm. The <>un rose
</p>
<p>upon fresh fields and newly budding woods, and
</p>
<p>scarcely had the morning mists dissolved, when the
</p>
<p>garrison could see a fleet of birch canoes crossing

<p>the river from the eastern shore, within range of
</p>
<p>cannon shot above the fort. Only two or three
</p>
<p>warriors appeared in each, but all moved slowly,
</p>
<p>and seemed deeply laden. In truth, they were full
</p>
<p>of savages, lying flat on their faces, that their num-
</p>
<p>bers might not excite the suspicion of the English. 1
</p>
<p>At an early hour the open common behind the

<p>riors, some naked, and others fantastically arrayed

<p>stalking towards the fort, and casting malignant

<p>Sterling, and the other English fur-traders, closed
</p>
<p>their storehouses and armed their men, and all in
</p>
<p>cool confidence stood waiting the result.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pontiac, who had crossed with the
</p>
<p>canoes from the eastern shore, was approaching
</p>
<p>along the river road, at the head of his sixty chiefs,
</p>
<p>all gravely marching in Indian file. A Canadian set-
</p>
<p>tler, named Beaufait, had been that morning to the
</p>
<p>fort. He was now returning homewards, and as he
</p>
<p>reached the bridge which led over the stream then
</p>
<p>called Parent's Creek, he saw the chiefs in the act
</p>
<p>of crossing from the farther bank. He stood aside
</p>
<p>to give them room. As the last Indian passed,
</p>
<p>Beaufait recognized him as an old friend and
</p>
<p>associate. The savage greeted him with the usual
</p>
<p>ejaculation, opened for an instant the folds of his
</p>
<p>blanket, disclosed the hidden gun, and, with an
</p>
<p>emphatic gesture towards the fort, indicated the
</p>
<p>purpose to which he meant to apply it. 2
</p>
<p>At ten o'clock, the great war-chief, with his
</p>
<p>treacherous followers, reached the fort, and the
</p>
<p>gateway was thronged with their savage faces.

</p>
<p>All were wrapped to the throat in colored blankets
</p>
<p>Some were crested with hawk, eagle, or raven
</p>
<p>plumes ; others had shaved their heads, leaving
</p>
<p>only the fluttering scalp-lock on the crown ; while
</p>
<p>others, again, wore their long, black hair flowing
</p>
<p>loosely at their backs, or wildly hanging about
</p>
<p>their brows like a lion's mane. Their bold yet
</p>
<p>crafty features, their cheeks besmeared with ochre
</p>
<p>and vermilion, white lead and soot, their keen,
</p>
<p>deep-set eyes gleaming in their sockets, like those
</p>
<p>of rattlesnakes, gave them an aspect grim, uncouth,
</p>
<p>and horrible. For the most part, they w^ere tall,
</p>
<p>strong men, and all had a gait and bearing of
</p>
<p>peculiar stateliness.
</p>
<p>As Pontiac entered, it is said that he started,
</p>
<p>and that a deep ejaculation half escaped from his
</p>
<p>breast. Well might his stoicism fail, for at a
</p>
<p>glance he read the ruin of his plot. On either
</p>
<p>hand, within the gateway, stood ranks of soldiers
</p>
<p>and hedges of glittering steel. The swarthy enga-
</p>
<p>ges of the fur-traders, armed to the teeth, stood in
</p>
<p>groups at the street corners, and the measured tap
</p>
<p>of a drum fell ominously on the ear. Soon regain-
</p>
<p>ing his composure, Pontiac strode forward into the
</p>
<p>narroAV street ; and his chiefs filed after him in
</p>
<p>3ilence, while the scared faces of women and
</p>
<p>children looked out from the windows as they
</p>
<p>passed. Their rigid muscles betrayed no sign of
</p>
<p>emotion ; yet, looking closely, one might have seen
</p>
<p>their small eyes glance from side to side with rest-
</p>
<p>less scrutiny.

</p>
<p>they reached the door of the council-house, a large
</p>
<p>building standing near the margin of the river
</p>
<p>On entering, they saw Gladwyn, with several of
</p>
<p>his officers, seated in readiness to receive them, and
</p>
<p>the observant chiefs did not fail to remark that
</p>
<p>every Englishman wore a sword at his side, and a
</p>
<p>pair of pistols in his belt. The conspirators eyed
</p>
<p>each other with uneasy glances. " Why," demanded
</p>
<p>Pontiac, " do I see so many of my father's young
</p>
<p>men standing in the street with their guns 1 "
</p>
<p>Gladwyn replied through his interpreter, La Butte,
</p>
<p>that he had ordered the soldiers under arms for
</p>
<p>the sake of exercise and discipline. With much
</p>
<p>delay and many signs of distrust, the chiefs at
</p>
<p>length sat down on the mats prepared for them ;
</p>
<p>and, after the customary pause, Pontiac rose to
</p>
<p>speak. Holding in his hand the wampum belt
</p>
<p>which was to have given the fatal signal, he ad-
</p>
<p>dressed the commandant, professing strong attach-
</p>
<p>ment to the English, and declaring, in Indian phrase,
</p>
<p>that he had come to smoke the pipe of peace,
</p>
<p>and brighten the chain of friendship. The officers
</p>
<p>watched him keenly as he uttered these hollow
</p>
<p>words, fearing lest, though conscious that his
</p>
<p>designs were suspected, he might still attempt to
</p>
<p>accomplish them. And once, it is said, he raised
</p>
<p>the wampum belt as if about to give the signal
</p>
<p>of attack. But at that instant Gladwyn signed
</p>
<p>slightly with his hand. The sudden clash of arms
</p>
<p>sounded from the passage without, and a drum
</p>
<p>rolling the charge filled the council-room with its

<p>founded. Some writers will have it, that Gladwyn,
</p>
<p>rising from his seat, drew the chiefs blanket aside,
</p>
<p>exposed the hidden gun, and sternly rebuked him
</p>
<p>for his treachery. But the commandant wished
</p>
<p>only to prevent the consummation of the plot,
</p>
<p>without bringing on an open rupture. His own
</p>
<p>letters affirm that he and his officers remained
</p>
<p>seated as before. Pontiac, seeing his unruffled
</p>
<p>brow and his calm eye fixed steadfastly upon him,
</p>
<p>knew not what to think, and soon sat down in
</p>
<p>amazement and perplexity. Another pause ensued,
</p>
<p>and Gladwyn commenced a brief reply. He assured
</p>
<p>the chiefs that friendship and protection should be
</p>
<p>extended towards them as long as they continued
</p>
<p>to deserve it, but threatened ample vengeance
</p>
<p>for the first act of aggression. The council then
</p>
<p>broke up ; but, before leaving the room, Pontiac told
</p>
<p>the officers that he would return in a few days,
</p>
<p>with his squaws and children, for he wished that
</p>
<p>they should all shake hands with their fathers the
</p>
<p>English. To this new piece of treachery Gladwyn
</p>
<p>deigned no reply. The gates of the fort, which
</p>
<p>had been closed during the conference, were again
</p>
<p>flung open, and the baffled savages were suffered
</p>
<p>to depart, rejoiced, no doubt, to breathe once more
</p>
<p>the free air of the open fields. 1

</p>
<p>Gladwyn has been censured, and perhaps with
</p>
<p>justice, for not detaining the chiefs as hostages for
</p>
<p>the good conduct of their followers. An entrapped
</p>
<p>wolf meets no quarter from the huntsman ; and a
</p>
<p>savage, caught in his treachery, has no claim to
</p>
<p>forbearance. Perhaps the commandant feared
</p>
<p>lest, should he arrest the chiefs when gathered at
</p>
<p>a public council, and guiltless as yet of open vio-
</p>
<p>lence, the act might be interpreted as cowardly
</p>
<p>and dishonorable. He was ignorant, moreover, of
</p>
<p>the true nature of the plot. In his view, the
</p>
<p>whole affair was one of those impulsive outbreaks
</p>
<p>so common among Indians ; and he trusted that,
</p>
<p>could an immediate rupture be averted, the threat-
</p>
<p>ening clouds would soon blow over.
</p>
<p>Here, and elsewhere, the conduct of Pontiac is
</p>
<p>marked with the blackest treachery ; and one cannot
</p>
<p>but lament that a commanding and magnanimous
</p>
<p>nature should be stained with the odious vice of
</p>
<p>cowards and traitors. He could govern, with
</p>
<p>almost despotic sway, a race unruly as the winds.

<p>In generous thought and deed, he rivalled the
</p>
<p>heroes of ancient story; and craft and cunning

<p>under their Blankets), they were so much surprized to see our Dispo-
</p>
<p>sition, that they would scarcely sit down to Council : However in about
</p>
<p>Half an hour, after they saw their Designs were Discovered, they sat
</p>
<p>Down, and Pontiac made a speech which I Answered calmly, without

</p>
<p>might well seem alien to a mind like his. Yet
</p>
<p>Pontiac was a thorough savage, and in him stand
</p>
<p>forth, in strongest light and shadow, the native
</p>
<p>faults and virtues of the Indian race. All children,
</p>
<p>says Sir Walter Scott, are naturally liars ; and
</p>
<p>truth and honor are developments of later educa-
</p>
<p>tion. Barbarism is to civilization what childhood
</p>
<p>is to maturity ; and all savages, whatever may be
</p>
<p>their country, their color, or their lineage, are
</p>
<p>prone to treachery nrA deceit. The barbarous
</p>
<p>ancestors of our own iiaiik and manly race are no
</p>
<p>less obnoxious to the charge than those of the cat
</p>
<p>like Bengalee ; for in this childhood of society
</p>
<p>brave men and cowards are treacherous alike.
</p>
<p>The Indian differs widely from the European in
</p>
<p>his notion of military virtue. In his view, artifice
</p>
<p>is wisdom ; and he honors the skill that can circum
</p>
<p>vent, no less than the valor that can subdue, an
</p>
<p>adversary. The object of war, he argues, is to
</p>
<p>destroy the enemy. To accomplish this end, all
</p>
<p>means are honorable ; and it is folly, not bravery,
</p>
<p>to incur a needless risk. Had Pontiac ordered his
</p>
<p>followers to storm the palisades of Detroit, not one
</p>
<p>of them would have obeyed him. They might,
</p>
<p>indeed, after their strange superstition, have rever-
</p>
<p>enced him as a madman ; but, from that hour, nis
</p>
<p>fame as a war-chief would have sunk forever.
</p>
<p>Balked in his treachery, the great chief with-
</p>
<p>drew to his village, enraged and mortified, yet still
</p>
<p>resolved to persevere. That Gladwyn had suffered
</p>
<p>him to escape, was to his mind an ample proof

<p>position seemed the more probable ; and he lesolved
</p>
<p>to visit the English once more, and convince them,
</p>
<p>if possible, that their suspicions against him were
</p>
<p>unfounded. Early on the following morning, he
</p>
<p>repaired to the fort with three of his chiefs, bearing
</p>
<p>in his hand the sacred calumet, or pipe of peace, its
</p>
<p>bowl carved in stone, and its stem adorned with feath-
</p>
<p>ers. Offering it to the commandant, he addressed
</p>
<p>him and his officers to the following effect : " My
</p>
<p>fathers, evil birds have sung lies in your ear. We
</p>
<p>that stand before you are friends of the English.
</p>
<p>We love them as our brothers ; and, to prove our
</p>
<p>love, w T e have come this day to smoke the pipe of
</p>
<p>peace." At his departure, he gave the pipe to
</p>
<p>Captain Campbell, second in command, as a farther
</p>
<p>pledge of his sincerity.
</p>
<p>That afternoon, the better to cover his designs,
</p>
<p>Pontiac called the young men of all the tribes
</p>
<p>to a game of ball, which took place, with great
</p>
<p>noise and shouting, on the neighboring fields. At
</p>
<p>nightfall, the garrison were startled by a burst of
</p>
<p>loud, shrill yells. The drums beat to arms, and
</p>
<p>the troops were ordered to their posts ; but the
</p>
<p>alarm was caused only by the victors in the ball
</p>
<p>play, who were announcing their success by these'
</p>
<p>discordant outcries. Meanwhile, Pontiac was in
</p>
<p>the Pottawattamie village, consulting with the
</p>
<p>chiefs of that tribe, and with the Wyandots, by
</p>
<p>what means they might compass the ruin of 'he

</p>
<p>ninth of May, the French inhabitants went in pro-
</p>
<p>cession to the principal church of the settlement,
</p>
<p>which stood near the river bank, ahjut half a mile
</p>
<p>above the fort. Having heard mass, they all
</p>
<p>returned before eleven o'clock, without discovering
</p>
<p>an) signs that the Indians meditated an immediate
</p>
<p>act of hostility. Scarcely, however, had they done
</p>
<p>so, when the common behind the fort was once
</p>
<p>more thronged with Indians of all the four tribes ;
</p>
<p>and Pontiac, advancing from among the multitude,
</p>
<p>approached the gate. It was closed and barred
</p>
<p>against him. He shouted to the sentinels, and
</p>
<p>demanded why he was refused admittance. Glad-
</p>
<p>wyn himself replied, that the great chief might
</p>
<p>enter, if he chose, but that the crowd he had
</p>
<p>brought with him must remain outside. Pontiac
</p>
<p>rejoined, that he wished all his warriors to enjoy
</p>
<p>the fragrance of the friendly calumet. Gladwyn's
</p>
<p>answer was more concise than courteous, and
</p>
<p>imported that he would have none of his rabble
</p>
<p>in the fort. Thus repulsed, Pontiac threw off the
</p>
<p>mask which he had worn so long. With a grin
</p>
<p>of hate and rage, he turned abruptly from the gate,
</p>
<p>and strode towards his -followers, who, in great
</p>
<p>multitudes, lay flat upon the ground, just beyond
</p>
<p>teach of gunshot. At his approach, they all leaped
</p>
<p>up and ran off, " yelping," in the words of an eye-

<p>witness, " like so many devils." !

<p>an old English woman, who lived, with her family,
</p>
<p>on a distant part of the common. They beat down
</p>
<p>the doors, and rushed tumultuously in. A moment
</p>
<p>more, and the mournful scalp-yell told the fate of
</p>
<p>the wretched inmates. Another large body ran,
</p>
<p>yelling, to the river bank, and, leaping into their
</p>
<p>canoes, paddled with all speed to the Isle au
</p>
<p>Cochon, where dwelt an Englishman, named Eisher,
</p>
<p>formerly a sergeant of the regulars.
</p>
<p>They soon dragged him from the hiding-place
</p>
<p>where he had sought refuge, murdered him on the
</p>
<p>spot, took his scalp, and made great rejoicings
</p>
<p>over this miserable trophy of brutal malice. On
</p>
<p>the following day, several Canadians crossed over
</p>
<p>to the island to inter the body, which they accom-
</p>
<p>plished, as they thought, very effectually. Tradition,
</p>
<p>however, relates, as undoubted truth, that when, a
</p>
<p>few days after, some of the party returned to the
</p>
<p>spot, they beheld the pale hands of the dead man
</p>
<p>thrust above the ground, in an attitude of eager
</p>
<p>entreaty. Having once more covered the refrac-
</p>
<p>tory members with earth, they departed, in great
</p>
<p>wonder and awe ; but what was their amazement,
</p>
<p>when, on returning a second time, they saw the
</p>
<p>hands protruding as before. At this, they repaired
</p>
<p>in horror to the priest, who hastened to the spot,
</p>
<p>[ sprinkled the grave with holy water, and performed
</p>
<p>over it the neglected rites of burial. Thenceforth,
</p>
<p>says the tradition, the corpse of the murdered
</p>
<p>soldier slept in peace. 1

</p>
<p>Pontiac had borne no part in the wolfish deeds
</p>
<p>of his followers. When he saw his plan defeated,
</p>
<p>he turned towards the shore ; and no man durst
</p>
<p>approach him, for he was terrible in his rage.
</p>
<p>Pushing a canoe from the bank, he urged it with
</p>
<p>vigorous strokes, against the current, towards the
</p>
<p>Ottawa village, on the farther side. As he drew
</p>
<p>near, he shouted to the inmates. None remained
</p>
<p>in the lodges but women, children, and old men,
</p>
<p>who all came flocking out at the sound of his impe-
</p>
<p>rious voice. Pointing across the water, he ordered
</p>
<p>that all should prepare to move the camp to the west-
</p>
<p>ern shore, that the river might no longer interpose a
</p>
<p>barrier between his followers and the English. The
</p>
<p>squaws labored with eager alacrity to obey him.
</p>
<p>Provisions, utensils, weapons, and even the bark
</p>
<p>covering to the lodges, were carried to the shore :
</p>
<p>and before evening all was ready for embarkation.
</p>
<p>Meantime, the warriors had come dropping in from
</p>
<p>their bloody work, until, at nightfall, nearly Jtll
</p>
<p>had returned. Then Pontiac, hideous in his war-
</p>
<p>paint, leaped into the central area of the village.
</p>
<p>Brandishing his tomahawk, and stamping on the
</p>
<p>ground, he recounted his former exploits, and
</p>
<p>denounced vengeance on the English. The Indiars
</p>
<p>flocked about him. Warrior after warrior caught
</p>
<p>the fierce contagion, and soon the ring was filled
</p>
<p>with dancers, circling round and round with frantic
</p>
<p>gesture, and startling the distant garrison with
</p>
<p>unearthly yells. 1

<p>was commenced, and long before morning the
</p>
<p>transfer was complete. The whole Ottawa popu-
</p>
<p>lation crossed the river, and pitched their wigwams
</p>
<p>on the western side, just above the mouth of the
</p>
<p>little stream then known as Parent's Creek, but
</p>
<p>since named Bloody Run, from the scenes of terror
</p>
<p>which it witnessed. 1
</p>
<p>During the evening, fresh tidings of disaster
</p>
<p>reached the fort. A Canadian, named Desnoyers,
</p>
<p>came down the river in a birch canoe, and, landing
</p>
<p>at the water gate, brought news that two English
</p>
<p>officers, Sir Robert Davers and Captain Robertson,
</p>
<p>had been waylaid and murdered by the Indians,
</p>
<p>above Lake St. Clair. 2 The Canadian declared,
</p>

<p>L763, Mat.] GENERAL ATTACK. 285
</p>
<p>Lay down to sleep, and Gladwyn himself walked
</p>
<p>the ramparts throughout the night.
</p>
<p>All was quiet till the approach of dawn. Bui
</p>
<p>as the first dim redness tinged the east, and fields
</p>
<p>and woods grew visible in the morning twilight,
</p>
<p>suddenly the war-whoop rose on every side at once.
</p>
<p>As wolves assail the wounded bison, howling their
</p>
<p>gathering cries across the wintry prairie, so the
</p>
<p>fierce Indians, pealing their terrific yells, came
</p>
<p>bounding naked to the assault. The men hastened
</p>
<p>to their posts. And truly it was time ; for not the
</p>
<p>Ottawas alone, but the whole barbarian swarm
</p>
<p>Wyandots, Pottawattamies, and Ojibwas  were upon
</p>
<p>them, and bullets rapped hard and fast against the
</p>
<p>palisades. The soldiers looked from the loopholes,
</p>
<p>thinking to see their assailants gathering for a rush
</p>
<p>against the feeble barrier. But, though their clam-
</p>
<p>ors filled the air, and their guns blazed thick and
</p>
<p>hot, yet very few were visible. Some were ensconced
</p>
<p>behind barns and fences, some skulked among
</p>
<p>bushes, and some lay flat in hollows of the ground :
</p>
<p>while those who could find no shelter were leaping
</p>
<p>about with the agility of monkeys, to dodge the
</p>
<p>shot of the fort. Each had filled his mouth with
</p>
<p>bullets, for the convenience of loading, and each
</p>
<p>was charging and firing without suspending thesr
</p>
<p>agile gymnastics for a moment. There was one
</p>
<p>low hill, at no great distance from the fort, behind
</p>
<p>which countless black heads of Indians alternately
</p>
<p>appeared and vanished; while, all along the ridge,
</p>
<p>then guns emitted incessant white puffs of smoke.

<p>Every loophole was a target for their bullets ; but

</p>
<p>the fire was returned with steadiness, and not
</p>
<p>without effect. The Canadian engages of the fur-
</p>
<p>traders retorted the Indian war-whoops with outcries
</p>
<p>not less discordant, while the British and provin-
</p>
<p>cials paid back the clamor of the enemy with
</p>
<p>musket and rifle balls. Within half gunshot of
</p>
<p>the palisades was a cluster of outbuildings, behind
</p>
<p>which a host of Indians found shelter. A cannon
</p>
<p>was brought to bear upon them, loaded with red-hot
</p>
<p>spikes. They were soon wrapped in flames, upon
</p>
<p>which the disconcerted savages broke away in a
</p>
<p>body, and ran off yelping, followed by a shout of
</p>
<p>laughter from the soldiers. 1
</p>
<p>For six hours, the attack was unabated ; but as
</p>
<p>the day advanced, the assailants grew weary of
</p>
<p>their futile efforts. Their fire slackened, their
</p>
<p>clamors died away, and the garrison was left once
</p>
<p>more in peace, though from time to time a solitary
</p>
<p>shot, or lonely whoop, still showed the presence of
</p>
<p>some lingering savage, loath to be balked of his
</p>
<p>revenge. Among the garrison, only five men had
</p>
<p>been wounded, while the cautious enemy had suf-
</p>
<p>fered but trifling loss.
</p>
<p>Gladwyn was still convinced that the whole affair
</p>
<p>was a sudden ebullition, which would soon subside ;
</p>
<p>and being, moreover, in great want of provisions,
</p>
<p>he resolved to open negotiations with the Indians,
</p>
<p>under cover of which he might obtain the neces-
</p>
<p>sary supplies. The interpreter, La Butte, who,
</p>
<p>like most of his countrymen, might be said to hold

</p>
<p>1763, Mat.] A TRUCE. 237
</p>
<p>a neutral position between the English and the
</p>
<p>Indians, was despatched to the camp of Pontiac, to
</p>
<p>demand the reasons of his conduct, and declare
</p>
<p>that the commandant was ready to redress any real
</p>
<p>grievance of which he might complain. Two old
</p>
<p>Canadians of Detroit, Chapeton and Godefroy, ear-
</p>
<p>nest to forward the negotiation, offered to accompany
</p>
<p>him. The gates were opened for their departure,
</p>
<p>and many other inhabitants of the place took this
</p>
<p>opportunity of leaving it, alleging as their motive,
</p>
<p>that they did not wish to see the approaching
</p>
<p>slaughter of the English.
</p>
<p>Eeaching the Indian Camp, the three ambassa
</p>
<p>dors were received by Pontiac with great apparent
</p>
<p>kindness. La Butte delivered his message, and
</p>
<p>the two Canadians labored to dissuade the chief,
</p>
<p>for his own good and for theirs, from pursuing
</p>
<p>his hostile purposes. Pontiac stood listening,
</p>
<p>armed with the true impenetrability of an Indian.
</p>
<p>At every proposal, he uttered an ejaculation of
</p>
<p>assent, partly from a strange notion of courtesy
</p>
<p>peculiar to his race, and partly from the deep dis-
</p>
<p>simulation which seems native to their blood. Yet
</p>
<p>with all this seeming acquiescence, the heart ot
</p>
<p>the savage was unmoved as a rock. The Canadi-
</p>
<p>ans were completely deceived. Leaving Chapeton
</p>
<p>and Godefroy to continue the conference and push
</p>
<p>the fancied advantage, La Butte hastened back to
</p>
<p>the fort. He reported the happy issue of his mis-
</p>
<p>sion, and added that peace might readily be had
</p>
<p>by making the Indians a few presents, for which

</p>
<p>he returned to the Indian camp, he found, to 'his
</p>
<p>chagrin, that his companions had made no progress
</p>
<p>in the negotiation. Though still professing a strong
</p>
<p>desire for peace, Pontiac had evaded every definite
</p>
<p>proposal. At La Butte's appearance, all the chiefs
</p>
<p>withdrew to consult among themselves. They
</p>
<p>returned after a short debate, and Pontiac declared
</p>
<p>that , out of their earnest desire for firm and lasting
</p>
<p>peace, they wished to hold council with their Eng
</p>
<p>lish fathers themselves. With this view, they were
</p>
<p>especially desirous that Captain Campbell, second
</p>
<p>in command, should visit their camp. This veteran
</p>
<p>off] cer, from his just, upright, and manly character,
</p>
<p>had gained the confidence of the Indians. To the
</p>
<p>Canadians the proposal seemed a natural one, and
</p>
<p>returning to the fort, they laid it before the com-
</p>
<p>mandant. Gladwyn suspected treachery, but Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Campbell urgently asked permission to comply
</p>
<p>with the request of Pontiac. He felt, he said, no
</p>
<p>fear of the Indians, with whom he had always
</p>
<p>maintained the most friendly terms. Gladwyn,
</p>
<p>with some hesitation, acceded ; and Campbell left
</p>
<p>the fort, accompanied by a junior officer, Lieutenant
</p>
<p>M'Dougal, and attended by La Butte and several
</p>
<p>ether Canadians.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, M. Gouin, anxious to learn
</p>
<p>what was passing, had entered the Indian camp,
</p>
<p>and, moving from lodge to lodge, soon saw and
</p>
<p>heard enough to convince him that the two British
</p>
<p>officers were advancing into the lion's jaws. 1 He
</p>
<p>hastened to despatch two messengers to warn them

</p>
<p>uf the peril. The party had scarcely left the gate
</p>
<p>when they were met by these men, breathless with
</p>
<p>running ; but the warning came too late. Once
</p>
<p>embarked on the embassy, the officers would not
</p>
<p>be diverted from it ; and passing up the river road,
</p>
<p>they approached the little wooden bridge that
</p>
<p>led over Parent's Creek. Crossing this bridge, and
</p>
<p>ascending a rising ground beyond, they saw before
</p>
<p>them the wide-spread camp of the Ottawas. A
</p>
<p>dark multitude gathered along its outskirts, and no
</p>
<p>sooner did they recognize the red uniform of the
</p>
<p>officers, than they all raised at once a horrible out-
</p>
<p>cry of whoops and howlings. Indeed, they seemed
</p>
<p>disposed to give the ambassadors the reception
</p>
<p>usually accorded to captives taken in war ; for the
</p>
<p>women seized sticks, stones, and clubs, and ran
</p>
<p>towards Campbell and his companion, as if to make
</p>
<p>them pass the cruel ordeal of running the gauntlet. 1
</p>
<p>Pontiac came forward, and his voice allayed the
</p>
<p>tumult. He shook the officers by the hand, and,
</p>
<p>1 When a party returned with prisoners, the whole population of the
</p>
<p>village turned out to receive them, armed with sticks, clubs, or even
</p>
<p>deadlier weapons. The captive was ordered to run to a given point,
</p>
<p>usually some conspicuous lodge, or a post driven into the ground, while
</p>
<p>ln's tormentors, ranging themselves in two rows, inflicted on him a mer-
</p>
<p>ciless flagellation, which only ceased when he had reached the goal
</p>
<p>Among the Iroquois, prisoners wave led through the whole confederacy,
</p>
<p>undergoing this martyrdom at every village, and seldom escaping without
</p>
<p>the loss of a hand, a finger, or an eye. Sometimes the sufferer was made
</p>
<p>to dance and sing, for the better entertainment of the crowd.
</p>
<p>The story of General Stark is well known. Being captured, in his
</p>
<p>youth, by the Indians, and told to run the gauntlet, he instantly knocked
</p>
<p>down the nearest warrior, snatched a club from his hands, and wielded it
</p>
<p>with such good- will that no one dared approach him, and he reached the
</p>
<p>'leath

<p>turning, led the way through the camp. It was a
</p>
<p>confused assemblage of huts, chiefly of a conical
</p>
<p>or half-spherical shape, and constructed of a slen-
</p>
<p>der framework covered with rush mats or sheets
</p>
<p>}f birch-bark. Many of the graceful birch canoes,
</p>
<p>used by the Indians of the upper lakes, were lying
</p>
<p>here and there among paddles, fish-spears, and
</p>
<p>blackened kettles slung above the embers of the
</p>
<p>fires. The camp was full of lean, wolfish dogs,
</p>
<p>who, roused by the clamor of their owners, kept up
</p>
<p>a discordant baying as the strangers passed. Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac paused before the entrance of a large lodge,
</p>
<p>and, entering, pointed to several mats placed on
</p>
<p>the ground, at the side opposite the opening.
</p>
<p>Here, obedient to his signal, the two officers sat
</p>
<p>down. Instantly the lodge was thronged with
</p>
<p>savages. Some, and these were for the most part
</p>
<p>chiefs, or old men, seated themselves on the ground
</p>
<p>before the strangers ; while the remaining space
</p>
<p>was filled by a dense crowd, crouching or standing
</p>
<p>erect, and peering over each other's shoulders. At
</p>
<p>their first entrance, Pontiac had spoken a few
</p>
<p>words. A pause then ensued, broken at length by
</p>
<p>Campbell, who from his scat addressed the Indians
</p>
<p>in a short speech. It was heard in perfect silence,
</p>
<p>and no reply was made. For a full hour, the
</p>
<p>unfortunate officers saw before them the same
</p>
<p>concourse of dark, inscrutable faces, bending an
</p>
<p>unwavering gaze upon them. Some were passing
</p>
<p>out, and others coming in to supply their places, and
</p>
<p>indulge their curiosity by a sight of the Englishmen.

<p>At length, Captain Campbell, conscious, no doubt,

</p>
<p>of the danger in which he was placed, resolved fulty
</p>
<p>to ascertain his true position, and, rising to his feet,
</p>
<p>declared his intention of returning to the fort.
</p>
<p>Pontiac made a sign that he should resume his seat.
</p>
<p>" My father," he said, " will sleep to-night in the
</p>
<p>lodges of his red children." The gray-haired sol-
</p>
<p>dier and his companion were betrayed into the
</p>
<p>hands of their enemies.
</p>
<p>Many of the Indians were eager to kill the cap-
</p>
<p>tives on the spot, but Pontiac would not carry his
</p>
<p>treachery so far. He protected them from injury
</p>
<p>and insult, and conducted them to the house of M.
</p>
<p>Meloche, near Parent's Creek, where good quarters
</p>
<p>were assigned them, and as much liberty allowed
</p>
<p>as was consistent with safe custody. 1 The peril
</p>
<p>of their situation was diminished by the circum-
</p>
<p>stance that two Indians, who, several days before,
</p>
<p>had been detained at the fort for some slight offence,
</p>
<p>still remained prisoners in the power ^f the com

<p>downcast look, which sufficiently expressed the

</p>
<p>to put all within to the torture. The anonymous author of the Diary oj

</p>
<p>PONTIAC AT THE SIEGE OF DETROIT.
</p>
<p>On the morning after the detention of the offi-
</p>
<p>cers, Pontiac crossed over, with several of his chiefs.
</p>
<p>to the Wyandot village. A part of this tribe, influ-
</p>
<p>enced by Father Pothier, their Jesuit priest, had
</p>
<p>refused to take up arms against the English ; but,
</p>
<p>being now threatened with destruction if they should
</p>
<p>longer remain neutral, they were forced to join
</p>
<p>the rest. They stipulated, however, that they
</p>
<p>should be allowed time to hear mass, before dan-
</p>
<p>cing the war-dance. 1 To this condition Pontiac
</p>
<p>readily agreed, " although," observes the chronicler
</p>
<p>in the fulness of his horror and detestation, " he
</p>
<p>himself had no manner of worship, and cared not
</p>
<p>for festivals or Sundays." These nominal Christians
</p>
<p>of Father Pothier's flock, together with the other
</p>
<p>Wyandots, soon distinguished themselves in the
</p>
<p>war ; fighting better, it was said, than all the other

<p>Indians,  an instance of the marked superiority
</p>
<p>of the Iroquois over the Algonquin stock.

<p>pared to resume his operations with fresh vigor ;
</p>
<p>and to this intent, he made an improved disposition
</p>
<p>of his forces. Some of the Pottawattamies were
</p>
<p>ordered to lie in wait along the river hank, below
</p>
<p>the fort ; while others concealed themselves in the
</p>
<p>woods, in order to intercept any Englishman who
</p>
<p>might approach by land or water. Another band
</p>
<p>of the same tribe were to conceal themselves in
</p>
<p>the neighborhood of the fort, when no general
</p>
<p>attack was going forward, in order to shoot down
</p>
<p>any soldier or trader who might chance to expose
</p>
<p>his person. On the eleventh of May, when these
</p>
<p>arrangements were complete, several Canadians
</p>
<p>came early in the morning to the fort, to offer what
</p>
<p>they called friendly advice. It was to the effect
</p>
<p>that the garrison should at once abandon the place,
</p>
<p>as it would be stormed within an hour by fifteen
</p>
<p>hundred Indians. Gladwyn refused, whereupon
</p>
<p>the Canadians departed ; and soon after some six
</p>
<p>hundred Indians began a brisk fusillade, which
</p>
<p>they kept up till seven o'clock in the evening. A
</p>
<p>Canadian then appeared, bearing a summons from
</p>
<p>Pontiac, demanding r the surrender of the fort, and
</p>
<p>promising that the English should go unmolested
</p>
<p>on board their vessels, leaving all their arms and
</p>
<p>effects behind. Gladwyn again gave a flat refusal. 1
</p>
<p>On the evening of that day, the officers met to
</p>
<p>consider what course of conduct the emergency
</p>
<p>required ; and, as one of them writes, the com-
</p>
<p>mandant was almost alone in the opinion that they

</p>
<p>ought still to defend the place. 1 It seemed to
</p>
<p>the rest that the only course remaining was to
</p>
<p>embark and sail for Niagara. Their condition
</p>
<p>appeared desperate ; for, on the shortest allowance,
</p>
<p>they had scarcely provision enough to sustain the
</p>
<p>garrison three weeks, within which time there was
</p>
<p>little hope of succor. The houses being, moreover,
</p>
<p>of wood, and chiefly thatched with straw, might be
</p>
<p>set on fire with burning missiles. But the chief
</p>
<p>apprehensions of the officers arose from their dread
</p>
<p>that the enemy would make a general onset, and
</p>
<p>cut or burn their way through the pickets,  a
</p>
<p>mode of attack to which resistance would be un-
</p>
<p>availing. Their anxiety on this score was relieved
</p>
<p>by a Canadian in the fort, who had spent half his
</p>
<p>life among Indians, and who now assured the com-
</p>
<p>mandant that every maxim of their warfare was
</p>
<p>opposed to such a measure. Indeed, an Indian's
</p>
<p>idea of military honor widely differs, as before
</p>
<p>observed, from that of a white man ; for he holds
</p>
<p>it to consist no less in a wary regard to his own
</p>
<p>life than in the courage and impetuosity with
</p>
<p>which he assails his enemy. His constant aim
</p>
<p>is to gain advantages without incurring loss.
</p>
<p>He sets an inestimable value on the lives of his
</p>
<p>own party, and deems a victory dearly purchased
</p>
<p>by the death of a single warrior. A war-chief
</p>
<p>attains the summit of his renown when he can
</p>
<p>boast that he has brought home a score of scalps
</p>
<p>without the loss of a man ; and his reputation is
</p>
<p>wofully abridged if the mournful wailings of the

<p>women mingle with the exulting yells of th^ war-
</p>
<p>riors. Yet, with all his subtlety and caution, the
</p>
<p>Indian is not a coward, and, in his own way of
</p>
<p>fighting, often exhibits no ordinary courage. Steal-
</p>
<p>ing alone into the heart of an enemy's country, he
</p>
<p>prowls around the hostile village, watching every
</p>
<p>movement ; and when night sets in, he enters a
</p>
<p>lodge, and calmly stirs the decaying embers, that,
</p>
<p>by their light, he may select his sleeping victims.
</p>
<p>With cool deliberation he deals the mortal thrust,
</p>
<p>kills foe after foe, and tears away scalp after scalp,
</p>
<p>until at length an alarm is given ; then, with a
</p>
<p>wild yell, he bounds out into the darkness, and is
</p>
<p>gone.
</p>
<p>Time passed on, and brought little change and
</p>
<p>no relief to the harassed and endangered garrison.
</p>
<p>Day after day the Indians continued their attacks,
</p>
<p>until their war-cries and the rattle of tbeir guns
</p>
<p>became familiar sounds. For many weeks, no
</p>
<p>man lay down to sleep, except in his clothes,

<p>and with his weapons by his side. 1 Parties of

<p>They cut down orchard trees, and levelled fences,
</p>
<p>until the ground about the fort was clear and
</p>
<p>open, and the enemy had no cover left from
</p>
<p>whence to fire. The two vessels in the river,
</p>
<p>sweeping the northern and southern curtains of the
</p>
<p>works with their fire, deterred the Indians from
</p>
<p>approaching those points, and gave material aid to
</p>
<p>the garrison. Still, worming their way through
</p>
<p>the grass, sheltering themselves behind every rising
</p>
<p>ground, the pertinacious savages would crawl close
</p>
<p>to the palisade, and shoot arrows, tipped with burn-
</p>
<p>ing tow, upon the roofs of the houses ; but cisterns
</p>
<p>and tanks of water were everywhere provided against
</p>
<p>such an emergency, and these attempts proved
</p>
<p>abortive. The little church, which stood near
</p>
<p>the palisade, was particularly exposed, and would
</p>
<p>probably have been set on fire, had not the priest

<p>of the settlement threatened Pontiac with the ven-

<p>geance of the Great Spirit, should he be guilty of
</p>
<p>such sacrilege. Pontiac, who w T as filled with eager-

<p>ness to get possession of the garrison, neglected no

<p>went farther, and begged the French inhabitants to

<p>teach him the European method of attacking a

</p>
<p>after the first attack, the Ottawa chief had sent
</p>
<p>in to Gladwyn a summons to surrender, assuring
</p>
<p>him that, if the place were at once given up, ho
</p>
<p>might embark on board the vessels, with all his
</p>
<p>men ; but that, if he persisted in his defence, he
</p>
<p>would treat him as Indians treat each other ; that
</p>
<p>is, he would burn him alive. To this Gladwyn
</p>
<p>made answer that he cared nothing for his threats. 1
</p>
<p>The attacks were now renewed with increased ac-
</p>
<p>tivity, and the assailants were soon after inspired
</p>
<p>with fresh ardor by the arrival of a hundred and
</p>
<p>twenty Ojibwa warriors from Grand River. Every
</p>
<p>man in the fort, officers, soldiers, traders, and
</p>
<p>engages, now slept upon the ramparts ; even in
</p>
<p>stormy weather none were allowed to withdraw to
</p>
<p>their quarters ; 2 yet a spirit of confidence and
</p>
<p>cheerfulness still prevailed among the weary gar-
</p>
<p>rison.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, great efforts were made to procure a
</p>
<p>supply of provisions. Every house was examined,
</p>
<p>and all that could serve for food, even grease and
</p>
<p>tallow, was collected and placed in the public
</p>
<p>storehouse, compensation having first been made to
</p>
<p>the owners. Notwithstanding these precautions
</p>
<p>Detroit must have been abandoned or destroyed,
</p>
<p>but for the assistance of a few friendly Canadians,
</p>
<p>and especially of M. Baby, a prominent habitant,
</p>
<p>who lived on the opposite side of the river, and

<p>provided the garrison with cattle, hogs, and other

<p>ned from liis farm to the fort in boats, the Indiana
</p>
<p>long remaining ignorant of what was going for-
</p>
<p>ward. 1
</p>
<p>They, on their part, began to suffer from hunger.
</p>
<p>Thinking to have taken Detroit at a single stroke,
</p>
<p>they had neglected, with their usual improvidence,
</p>
<p>to provide against the exigencies of a siege ; and
</p>
<p>now, in small parties, they would visit the Cana
</p>
<p>dian families along the river shore, passing from
</p>
<p>house to house, demanding provisions, and threat-
</p>
<p>ening violence in case of refusal. This was the
</p>
<p>more annoying, since the food thus obtained was
</p>
<p>wasted with characteristic recklessness. Unable to
</p>
<p>endure it longer, the Canadians appointed a depu-
</p>
<p>tation of fifteen of the eldest among them to wait
</p>
<p>upon Pontiac, and complain of his followers' con-
</p>
<p>duct. The meeting took place at a Canadian
</p>
<p>house, probably that of M. Meloche, where the
</p>
<p>great chief had made his headquarters, and where
</p>
<p>the prisoners, Campbell and M'Dougal, were con-
</p>
<p>fined.

</p>
<p>250 PONTIAC AT DETROIT. [1763, Max June
</p>
<p>When Pontiac saw the deputation approaching
</p>
<p>along the river road, he was seized with an exceed
</p>
<p>ing eagerness to know the purpose of their visit ;
</p>
<p>for having long desired to gain the Canadians as
</p>
<p>allies against the English, and made several advan-
</p>
<p>ces to that effect, he hoped that their present errand
</p>
<p>might relate to the object next his heart. So
</p>
<p>strong was his curiosity, that, forgetting the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary rule of Indian dignity and decorum, he asked
</p>
<p>the business on which they had come before they
</p>
<p>hemselves had communicated it. The Canadians
</p>
<p>replied, that they wished the chiefs to be convened,
</p>
<p>for they were about to speak upon a matter of
</p>
<p>much importance. Pontiac instantly despatched
</p>
<p>messengers to the different camps and villages.
</p>
<p>The chiefs, soon arriving at his summons, entered
</p>
<p>the apartment, where they seated themselves upon
</p>
<p>the floor, having first gone through the necessary
</p>
<p>formality of shaking hands with the Canadian depu
</p>
<p>ties. After a suitable pause, the eldest of the
</p>
<p>French rose, and heavily complained of the out-
</p>
<p>rages which they had committed. " You pretend,"
</p>
<p>he said, " to be friends of the French, and yet you
</p>
<p>plunder us of our hogs and cattle, you trample
</p>
<p>upon our fields of young corn, and when you enter
</p>
<p>our houses, you enter with tomahawk raised. When
</p>
<p>your French father comes from Montreal with his
</p>
<p>great army, he will hear of what you have done,
</p>
<p>and, instead of shaking hands with you as brethren,
</p>
<p>he will punish you as enemies."

</p>
<p>When the speaker had concluded, he returned the
</p>
<p>following answer : 
</p>
<p>" Brothers :
</p>
<p>" We have never wished to do you harm, nor
</p>
<p>allow any to be done you ; but among us there are
</p>
<p>many young men who, though strictly watched ,
</p>
<p>find opportunities of mischief. It is not to revenge
</p>
<p>myself alone that I make war on the English. It
</p>
<p>is to revenge you, my Brothers. When the English
</p>
<p>insulted us, they insulted you also. I know that
</p>
<p>they have taken away your arms, and made you
</p>
<p>sign a paper which they have sent home to their
</p>
<p>country. Therefore you are left defenceless ; and
</p>
<p>I mean now to revenge your cause and my own
</p>
<p>together. I mean to destroy the English, and leave
</p>
<p>not one upon our lands. You do not know the
</p>
<p>reasons from which I act. I have told you those
</p>
<p>only which concern yourselves ; but you will learn
</p>
<p>all in time. You will cease then to think me a
</p>
<p>fool. I know, my brothers, that there are many
</p>
<p>among you who take part with the English. I am
</p>
<p>sorry for it, for their own sakes ; for when our
</p>
<p>Father arrives, I shall point them out to him, and
</p>
<p>they will see whether they or I have most reason
</p>
<p>to be satisfied with the part we have acted.
</p>
<p>" 1 do not doubt, my Brothers, that this war is
</p>
<p>very troublesome to you, for our warriors are con-
</p>
<p>tinually passing and repassing through your settle-
</p>
<p>ment. I am sorry for it. Do not think that I
</p>
<p>approve of the damage that is done by them ; and,

<p>as a proof of this, remember the war with the

<p>seventeen years since the Ojibwas of Michillimack-
</p>
<p>inac, combined with the Sacs and Foxes, came
</p>
<p>down to destroy yon. Who then defended yon]
</p>
<p>Was it not I and my young men ] Mickinac, great
</p>
<p>chief of all these nations, said in council that he
</p>
<p>would carry to his village the head of your com
</p>
<p>mandant  that he would eat his heart and drink
</p>
<p>his blood. Did I not take your part] Did I not
</p>
<p>go to his camp, and say to him, that if he wished
</p>
<p>to kill the French, he must first kill me and my
</p>
<p>warriors'? Did I not assist you in routing them
</p>
<p>and driving them away] 1 And now you think
</p>
<p>that I would turn my arms against you ! No,
</p>
<p>my Brothers ; I am the same French Pontiac vho
</p>
<p>assisted you seventeen years ago. I am a French-
</p>
<p>man, and I wish to die a Frenchman ; and I now
</p>
<p>repeat to you that you and I are one  that it is
</p>
<p>for both our interests that I should be avenged.
</p>
<p>1 The annals of these remote and gloomy regions are involved in such
</p>
<p>obscurity, that it is hard to discover the precise character of the events
</p>
<p>to which Pontiac here refers. The only allusion to them, which the
</p>
<p>writer has met with, is the following, inscribed on a tattered scrap of
</p>
<p>soiled paper, found among the M'Dougal manuscripts : 
</p>
<p>" Five miles below the mouth of Wolf River is the Great Death
</p>
<p>Ground. This took its name from the circumstance, that some years
</p>
<p>before the Old French War, a great battle was fought between the French
</p>
<p>troops, assisted by the Menornonies and Ottaways on the one side, and
</p>
<p>the Sac and Fox Indians on the other. The Sacs and Foxes were nearly
</p>
<p>sll cut off; and this proved the cause of their eventual expulsion from
</p>
<p>that country."
</p>
<p>The M'Dougal manuscripts, a v ove referred to, belonged to a son of the
</p>
<p>Lieutenant M'Dougal who was the fellow-prisoner of Major Campbell.
</p>
<p>On the death of the younger M'Dougal, the papers, which were very
</p>
<p>voluminous, and contained various notes concerning the Indian war, and

<p>the captivity of his father, came into the possession of a family at the

</p>
<p>Let me alone. I do not ask you for aid, ftr it ia
</p>
<p>not in your power to give it. I only ask provisions
</p>
<p>for myself and men. Yet, if you are inclined to
</p>
<p>assist me, I shall not refuse you. It would please
</p>
<p>me, and you yourselves would be sooner rid of
</p>
<p>your troubles ; for I promise you, that, as soon as
</p>
<p>the English are driven out, we will go back to our
</p>
<p>villages, and there await the arrival of our Frercta
</p>
<p>Father. You have heard what I have to say ;
</p>
<p>remain at peace, and I will watch that no harm
</p>
<p>shall be done to you, either by my men or by the
</p>
<p>other Indians."
</p>
<p>This speech is reported by a writer whose chief
</p>
<p>characteristic is the scrupulous accuracy with
</p>
<p>which he has chronicled minute details without
</p>
<p>interest or importance. He neglects, moreover, no
</p>
<p>opportunity of casting ignominy and contempt upon
</p>
<p>the name of Pontiac. His mind is of so dull and
</p>
<p>commonplace an order as to exclude the supposi-
</p>
<p>tion that he himself is author of the words which
</p>
<p>he ascribes to the Ottawa chief, and the speech
</p>
<p>may probably be taken as a literal translation of
</p>
<p>the original.
</p>
<p>As soon as the council broke up, Pontiac took
</p>
<p>measures for bringing the disorders complained of
</p>
<p>to a close, while, at the same time, he provided
</p>
<p>sustenance for his warriors ; and, in doing this, he
</p>
<p>displayed a policy and forecast scarcely paralleled
</p>
<p>in the history of his race. He first forbade the

<p>commission of farther outrage. 1 He next visited in

<p>turn the families of the Canadians, and, inspecting
</p>
<p>the property belonging to them, he assigned to
</p>
<p>each the share of provisions which it must furnish
</p>
<p>for the support of the Indians. 1 The contributions
</p>
<p>thus levied were all collected at the house of
</p>
<p>Meloche, near Parent's Creek, whence they were
</p>
<p>regularly issued, as the exigence required, to the
</p>
<p>savages of the different camps. As the character
</p>
<p>and habits of an Indian but ill qualify him to act
</p>
<p>the part of commissary, Pontiac in this matter
</p>
<p>availed himself of French assistance.
</p>
<p>On the river bank, not far from the house of

<p>Meloche. lived an old Canadian, named Quilleriez,
</p>
<p>a man of exceeding vanity and self-conceit, and
</p>
<p>noted in the settlement for the gayety of his attire.
</p>
<p>He wore moccasons of the most elaborate pattern,
</p>

<p>French, yet unable to make compensation for the

<p>provisions he had exacted, Pontiac had recourse
</p>
<p>to a remarkable expedient, suggested, no doubt, by
</p>
<p>one of these European assistants. lie issued pro

</p>
<p>cut channels in which it has run for ages, who

<p>reject instruction, and adhere with rigid tenacity to

<p>ancient ideas and usages. Pontiac always exhib-

<p>sents him as earnest to learn the military art as
</p>
<p>practised among Europeans, and as inquiring
</p>
<p>curiously into the mode of making cloth, knives,

<p>and the other articles of Indian trade. Of his

</p>
<p>singular testimony from the pen of General Gage

<p>there is reason to judge of Pontiac, not only as a
</p>
<p>savage possessed of the most refined cunning and
</p>
<p>treachery natural to the Indians, but as a person
</p>
<p>of extraordinary abilities. He says that he keeps

<p>better appreciate the commanding energy that
</p>
<p>could hold control over spirits so intractable.
</p>
<p>The glaring faults of Pontiac's character have
</p>
<p>already appeared too clearly. He was artful and
</p>
<p>treacherous, bold, fierce, ambitious, and revenge-
</p>
<p>ful ; yet the following anecdotes will evince that
</p>
<p>noble and generous thought was no stranger to
</p>
<p>the savage hero of this dark forest tragedy. Some
</p>
<p>time after the period of which we have been speak
</p>
<p>ing, Rogers came up to Detroit, with a detachment
</p>
<p>of troops, and, on landing, sent a bottle of brandy,
</p>
<p>by a friendly Indian, as a present to Pontiac. The
</p>
<p>Indians had always been suspicious that the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish meant to poison them. Those around the chief,
</p>
<p>endeavored to persuade him that the brandy was
</p>
<p>drugged. Pontiac listened to what they said, and,
</p>
<p>as soon as they had concluded, poured out a cup
</p>
<p>of the liquor, and immediately drank it, saying that
</p>
<p>the man whose life he had saved had no power to
</p>
<p>kill him. He referred to his having prevented the
</p>
<p>Indians from attacking Rogers and his party when
</p>
<p>on their way to demand the surrender of Detroit.
</p>
<p>The story may serve as a counterpart to the well-
</p>
<p>known anecdote of Alexander the Great and his
</p>
<p>physician. 1
</p>
<p>Pontiac had been an old friend of Baby ; and
</p>
<p>one evening, at an early period of the siege, he
</p>
<p>entered his house, and, seating himself by the fire,
</p>
<p>looked for some time steadily at the embers. At
</p>
<p>length, raising his head, he said he had heard that
</p>
<p>the English had offered the Canadian a bushel of

<p>silver for the scalp of his friend. Baby declared
</p>
<p>that the story was false, and protested that he would
</p>
<p>never betray him. Pontiac for a moment keenly
</p>
<p>studied his features. " My brother has spoken the
</p>
<p>truth," he said, ;; and I will show that I believe
</p>
<p>him." He remained in the house through the
</p>
<p>evening, and, at its close, wrapped himself in his
</p>
<p>blanket, and lay down upon a bench, where he
</p>
<p>slept in full confidence till morning. 1
</p>
<p>Another anecdote, from the same source, will
</p>
<p>exhibit the power which he exercised over the
</p>
<p>minds of his followers. A few young Wyandots
</p>
<p>were in the habit of coming, night after night, to
</p>
<p>the house of Baby, to steal hogs and cattle. The
</p>
<p>latter complained of the theft to Pontiac, and
</p>
<p>desired his protection. Being at that time igno-
</p>
<p>rant of the intercourse between Baby and the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish, Pontiac hastened to the assistance of his
</p>
<p>friend, and, arriving about nightfall at the house,
</p>
<p>walked to and fro among the barns and enclosures.
</p>
<p>At a late hour, he distinguished the dark forms of
</p>
<p>the plunderers stealing through the gloom. " Go
</p>
<p>back to your village, you Wyandot dogs," said the
</p>
<p>Ottawa chief; "if you tread again on this man's
</p>
<p>land, you shall die." They slunk back abashed ;
</p>
<p>and from that time forward the Canadian's property
</p>
<p>was safe. The Ottawas had no political connec-
</p>
<p>tion with the Wyandots, who speak a language
</p>
<p>radically distinct. Over them he could claim no
</p>
<p>legitimate authority; yet his powerful spirit forced

<p>CHAPTER Xm.
</p>
<p>ROUT OF CUYLER'S DETACHMENT.  FATE OF THE
</p>
<p>FOREST GARRISONS.
</p>
<p>While perils were thickening around the garri-
</p>
<p>son of Detroit, the British commander-in-chief at
</p>
<p>New York remained ignorant of its danger. In-
</p>
<p>deed, an unwonted quiet had prevailed, of late,
</p>
<p>along the borders and about the neighboring forts.
</p>
<p>With the opening of spring, a strong detachment
</p>
<p>had been sent up the lakes, with a supply of pro-
</p>
<p>visions and ammunition for the use of Detroit and
</p>
<p>the other western posts. The boats of this convoy
</p>
<p>were now pursuing their course along the northern
</p>
<p>shore of Lake Erie ; and Gladwyn's garrison,
</p>
<p>aware of their approach, awaited their arrival with
</p>
<p>an anxiety which every day increased.
</p>
<p>Day after day passed on, and the red cross of St.
</p>
<p>George still floated above Detroit. The keen-eyed
</p>
<p>watchfulness of the Indians had never abated ; and
</p>
<p>woe to the soldier who showed his head above the
</p>
<p>palisades, or exposed his person before a loophole.
</p>
<p>Strong in his delusive hope of French assistance,
</p>
<p>Pontiac had sent messengers to M. Neyon, com-

<p>mandant at the Illinois, earnestly requesting that a

<p>1763, Mat.] CONDITION 01 THE FORT. 261
</p>
<p>force of regular troops might be sent to his aid ,
</p>
<p>and Gladwyn, on his side, had ordered one of the
</p>
<p>vessels to Niagara, to hasten forward the expected
</p>
<p>convoy. The schooner set sail; but on the next
</p>
<p>day, as she lay becalmed at the entrance of Lake
</p>
<p>Erie, a multitude of canoes suddenly darted out
</p>
<p>upon her from the neighboring shores. In the
</p>
<p>prow of the foremost the Indians had placed tb en-
</p>
<p>prisoner, Captain Campbell, with the dastardly
</p>
<p>purpose of interposing him as a screen between
</p>
<p>themselves and the fire of the English. But the
</p>
<p>brave old man called out to the crew to do their
</p>
<p>duty, without regard to him. Happily, at that
</p>
<p>moment a fresh breeze sprang up ; the napping
</p>
<p>sails stretched to the wind, and the schooner bore
</p>
<p>prosperously on her course towards Niagara, leav-
</p>
<p>ing the savage flotilla far behind. 1
</p>
<p>The fort, or rather town, of Detroit had, by this
</p>
<p>time, lost its wonted vivacity and life. Its narrow
</p>
<p>streets were gloomy and silent. Here and there
</p>
<p>strolled a Canadian, in red cap and gaudy sash ;
</p>
<p>1 Penn. Gaz. No. 1807. MS. Letter Wilkins to Amherst, June 18.
</p>
<p>This incident may have suggested the story told by Mrs. Grant, in
</p>
<p>her Memoirs of an American Lady. A young British officer, of noble birth,
</p>
<p>had been living for some time among the Indians, and having encountered
</p>
<p>many strange adventures, he was now returning in a canoe with a partv
</p>
<p>of his late associates,  none of them, it appears, were aware that hostili-
</p>
<p>ties existed,  and approached the schooner just before the attack com-
</p>
<p>menced, expecting a friendly reception. Sir Robert D , the young
</p>
<p>officer, was in Indian costume, and, wishing to surprise his friends, he
</p>
<p>made no answer when hailed from the vessel, whereupon he was instantly
</p>
<p>fired at and killed.  The story is without confirmation, in any contem-
</p>
<p>porary document, and, indeed, is impossible in itself. Sir Robert Davers
</p>
<p>was killed, as before mentioned, near Lake St. Clair ; but neither in hig

<p>character, nor in the mode of his death, did he "at all resemble the

</p>
<p>the weary sentinel walked to and fro before the
</p>
<p>quarters of the commandant; an officer, perhaps,
</p>
<p>passed along with rapid step and anxious face ; or
</p>
<p>an Indian girl, the mate of some soldier or trader,
</p>
<p>moved silently by, in her finery of beads and ver-
</p>
<p>milion. Such an aspect as this the town must have
</p>
<p>presented on the morning of the thirtieth of May,
</p>
<p>when, at about nine o'clock, the voice of the senti-
</p>
<p>nel sounded from the south-east bastion ; and loud
</p>
<p>exclamations, in the direction of the river, roused
</p>
<p>Detroit from its lethargy. Instantly the place was
</p>
<p>astir. Soldiers, traders, and habitants, hurrying
</p>
<p>through the water-gate, thronged the canoe wharf
</p>
<p>and the narrow strand without. The half- wild
</p>
<p>coureurs de hois, the tall and sinewy provincials,
</p>
<p>and the stately British soldiers, stood crowded
</p>
<p>together, their uniforms soiled and worn, and
</p>
<p>their faces haggard with unremitted watching.
</p>
<p>Yet all alike wore an animated and joyous look.
</p>
<p>The long expected convoy was full in sight. On
</p>
<p>the farther side of the river, at some distance below
</p>
<p>the fort, a line of boats was rounding the woody
</p>
<p>projection, then called Montreal Point, their oars
</p>
<p>flashing in the sun, and the red flag of England
</p>
<p>flying from the stern of the foremost. 1 The toils
</p>
<p>and dangers of the garrison were drawing to an
</p>
<p>end. With one accord, they broke into three
</p>
<p>hearty cheers, again and again repeated, while a
</p>
<p>cannon, glancing from the bastion, sent its loud
</p>
<p>voice of defiance to the enemy, and welcome to

<p>approaching friends. But suddenly every cheek
</p>
<p>grew pale with horror. Dark naked figures were
</p>
<p>seen rising, with wild gesture, in the boats, while,
</p>
<p>in place of the answering salute, the distant yell
</p>
<p>of the war-whoop fell faintly on their ears. The
</p>
<p>convoy was in the hands of the enemy. The
</p>
<p>boats had all been taken, and the troops of the de-
</p>
<p>tachment slain or made captive. Officers and
</p>
<p>men stood gazing in mournful silence, when an
</p>
<p>incident occurred which caused them to forget the
</p>
<p>general calamity in the absorbing interest of the
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p>Leaving the disappointed garrison, we will pass
</p>
<p>over to the principal victims of this deplorable
</p>
<p>misfortune. In each of the boats, of which there
</p>
<p>were eighteen, two or more of the captured soldiers,
</p>
<p>deprived of their weapons, were compelled to act
</p>
<p>as rowers, guarded by several armed savages, while
</p>
<p>many other Indians, for the sake of farther security,
</p>
<p>followed the boats along the shore. 1 In the fore-
</p>
<p>most, as it happened, there were four soldiers and
</p>
<p>only three Indians. The larger of the two vessels
</p>
<p>still lay anchored in the stream, about a bow-shot
</p>
<p>from the fort, while her companion, as we have
</p>
<p>seen, had gone down to Niagara to hasten up this
</p>
<p>very re-enforcement. As the boat came opposite this
</p>
<p>vessel, the soldier who acted as steersman conceived
</p>
<p>a daring plan of escape. The principal Indian sat
</p>
<p>immediately in front of another of the soldiers. The
</p>
<p>steersman called, in English, to his comrade to seize

<p>the savage and throw him overboard. The man
</p>
<p>answered that he Avas not strong enough ; on which
</p>
<p>the steersman directed him to change places with
</p>
<p>him, as if fatigued with rowing, a movement which
</p>
<p>would excite no suspicion on the part of their
</p>
<p>guard. As the bold soldier stepped forward, as if
</p>
<p>tc take his companion's oar, he suddenly seized
</p>
<p>the Indian by the hair, and, griping with the other
</p>
<p>hand the girdle at his waist, lifted him by main
</p>
<p>force, and flung him into the river. The boat
</p>
<p>rocked till the water surged over her gunwale.
</p>
<p>The Indian held fast to his enemy's clothes, and,
</p>
<p>drawing himself upward as he trailed alongside,
</p>
<p>stabbed him again and again with his knife, and
</p>
<p>then dragged him overboard. Both went down the
</p>
<p>swift current, rising and sinking; and, as some
</p>
<p>relate, perished, grappled in each other's arms. 1
</p>
<p>The two remaining Indians leaped out of the boat.
</p>
<p>The prisoners turned, and pulled for the distant
</p>
<p>vessel, shouting aloud for aid. The Indians on
</p>
<p>shore opened a heavy fire upon them, and many
</p>
<p>canoes paddled swiftly in pursuit. The men
</p>
<p>strained with desperate strength. A fate inexpres-
</p>
<p>sibly horrible was the alternative. The bullets
</p>
<p>hissed thickly around their heads ; one of them
</p>
<p>was soon wounded, and the light birch canoes
</p>
<p>gained on them with fearful rapidity. Escape
</p>
<p>seemed hopeless, when the report of a cannon
</p>
<p>burst from the side of the vessel. The ball flew

<p>close past the boat, beating the water in a line of

</p>
<p>At this, the pursuers drew back in dismay ; and
</p>
<p>the Indians on shore, being farther saluted by
</p>
<p>a second shot, ceased filing, and scattered among
</p>
<p>the bushes. The prisoners soon reached the vessel,
</p>
<p>where they were greeted as men snatched from

<p>the jaws of fate ; " a living monument," writes an

<p>which had befallen them and their companions.

</p>
<p>as the thirteenth of May, and embarked from Fort
</p>
<p>Schlosser, just above the falls, with ninety-six men
</p>
<p>and a plentiful supply of provisions and ammuni

<p>shore of Lake Erie, and seen neither friend nor foe
</p>
<p>amid those lonely forests and waters, until, on the
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth of the month, he landed at Point
</p>
<p>Pelee, not far from the mouth of the River Detroit.

<p>The boats were drawn on the beach, and the party

<p>prepared to encamp. A man and a boy went to
</p>
<p>gather firewood at a short distance from the spot,
</p>
<p>when an Indian leaped out of the woods, seized
</p>
<p>the boy by the hair, and tomahawked him. The
</p>
<p>man ran into camp with the alarm. Cuyler imme-
</p>
<p>diately formed his soldiers into a semicircle before

<p>the boats. He had scarcely done so when the

<p>enemy opened their fire. For an instant, there was

</p>
<p>Indians broke out of the woods in a body, and
</p>
<p>rushed fiercely upon the centre of the line, which
</p>
<p>gave way in every part ; the men flinging down
</p>
<p>theii guns, running in a blind panic to the boats,
</p>
<p>and struggling with ill-directed efforts to shove
</p>
<p>them into the water. Five were set afloat, and
</p>
<p>pushed off from the shore, crowded with the terri-
</p>
<p>fied soldiers. Cuyler, seeing himself, as he says,
</p>
<p>deserted by his men, waded up to his neck in the
</p>
<p>lake, and climbed into one of the retreating boats.
</p>
<p>The Indians, on their part, pushing two more afloat,
</p>
<p>went in pursuit of the fugitives, three boat-loads of
</p>
<p>whom allowed themselves to be recaptured without
</p>
<p>resistance ; but the remaining two, in one of which
</p>
<p>was Cuyler himself, made their escape. 1 They
</p>
<p>rowed all night, and landed in the morning upon
</p>
<p>a small island. Between thirty and forty men,
</p>
<p>some of whom were wounded, were crowded in
</p>
<p>these tw r o boats ; the rest, about sixty in number,
</p>
<p>being killed or taken. Cuyler now made for
</p>
<p>Sandusky, which, on his arrival, he found burnt
</p>
<p>to the ground. Immediately leaving the spot,
</p>
<p>he rowed along the south shore to Presqu' Isle,

<p>from whence he proceeded to Niagara and re

<p>The actors in this bold and well-executed stroke

<p>in ambush at the mouth of the river, to intercept

<p>and other articles, taken in this attack, formed a

</p>
<p>the rest, a great quantity of whiskey. This the In-

<p>which, throughout the night, presented a scene of

<p>savage revelry and riot. The liquor was poured

</p>
<p>apart, wailing and moaning in maudlin drunken-
</p>
<p>ness, others were maddened to the ferocity of wild
</p>
<p>beasts. Dormant jealousies were awakened, old
</p>
<p>forgotten quarrels kindled afresh, and, had not the
</p>
<p>squaws taken the precaution of hiding all the
</p>
<p>weapons they could find before the debauch began,
</p>
<p>much blood would, no doubt, have been spilt. As
</p>
<p>it was, the savages were not entirely without means
</p>
<p>of indulging their drunken rage. Many were
</p>
<p>wounded, of whom two died in the morning ; and
</p>
<p>several others had their noses bitten off,  a singular
</p>
<p>mode of revenge, much in vogue upon similar occa-
</p>
<p>sions, among the Indians of the upper lakes. The
</p>
<p>English were gainers by this scene of riot ; for late
</p>
<p>in the evening, two Indians, in all the valor and
</p>
<p>vain-glory of drunkenness, came running directly
</p>
<p>towards the fort, boasting their prowess in a loud
</p>
<p>voice ; but being greeted with two rifle bullets, they

<p>leaped into the air like a pair of wounded bucks,

<p>and fell dead on their tracks.

<p>It will not be proper to pass over in silence the
</p>
<p>fate of the unfortunate men taken prisoners in this

</p>
<p>came to the fort, bringing vague and awful reports
</p>
<p>of the scenes that had been enacted at the Indian
</p>
<p>camp. The soldiers gathered round them, and,
</p>
<p>frozen with horror, listened to the appalling narra-
</p>
<p>tive. A cloud of deep gloom sank down upon the
</p>
<p>garrison, and none could help reflecting how thin
</p>
<p>and frail a barrier protected them from a similar

<p>fate. On the following day, and for several succeed-

</p>
<p>rumors they had heard. Naked corpses, gashed
</p>
<p>with knives and scorched with fire, floated down
</p>
<p>on the pure waters of the Detroit, whose fish came
</p>
<p>up to nibble at the clotted blood that clung to their
</p>
<p>ghastly faces. 1
</p>
<p>1 " The Indians, fearing that the other barges might escape as the first
</p>
<p>had done, changed their plan of going to the camp. They landed their
</p>
<p>prisoners, tied them, and conducted them by land to the Ottawas village,
</p>
<p>and then crossed them to Pondiac's camp, where they were all butchered.
</p>
<p>As soon as the canoes reached the shore, the barbarians landed their
</p>
<p>prisoners, one after the other, on the beach. They made them strip
</p>
<p>themselves, and then sent arrows into different parts of their bodies.
</p>
<p>These unfortunate men wished sometimes to throw themselves on the
</p>
<p>ground to avoid the arrows ; but they were beaten with sticks and forced
</p>
<p>to stand up until they fell dead ; after which those who had not fired fell
</p>
<p>upon their bodies, cut them in pieces, cooked, and ate them. On others
</p>
<p>they exercised different modes of torment by cutting their flesh with
</p>
<p>flints, and piercing them with lances. They would then cut their feet and
</p>
<p>hands off, and leave them weltering in their blood till they were dead.
</p>
<p>Others were fastened to stakes, and children employed in burning them
</p>
<p>with a slow fire. No kind of torment was left untried by these Indians.
</p>
<p>Some of the bodies were left on shore ; others were thrown into the river.
</p>
<p>Even the women assisted their husbands in torturing their victims. They
</p>
<p>slitted them with their knives, and mangled them in various ways. There
</p>
<p>were, however, a few whose lives were saved, being adopted to serve as
</p>
<p>slaves."  Pontiac MS.

<p>house of Mr. Meloche, where Pontiac and his Ottawas were encamped.

<p>The barges were landed, and, the women having arranged themselves in
</p>
<p>two rows, with clubs and sticks, the prisoners were taken out, one by

<p>one, and told to run the gauntlet to Pontiac's lodge. Of sixty-six persons

<p>who were brought to the shore, sixty-four ran the gauntlet, and were all

<p>had become by this time so much exhausted that he could not help him-

<p>self. He was thrown out of the boat and killed with clubs. The other,
</p>
<p>when directed to run for the lodge, suddenly fell upon his knees in the
</p>
<p>water, and having dipped his hand in the water, he made the sign of the
</p>
<p>cross on his forehead and breast, and darted out in the stream. An expert

<p>swimmer from the Indians followed him, and, having overtaken him,

<p>seized him by the hair, and crying out, ' You seem to love water ; you

<p>270 ROUT OF CUTLER'S DETACHMENT. [1763, Mai
</p>
<p>Late one afternoon, at about this period of the
</p>
<p>siege, the garrison were again greeted with the dis-
</p>
<p>mal cry of death, and a line of naked warriors was
</p>
<p>seen issuing from the woods, which, like a wall
</p>
<p>of foliage, rose beyond the pastures in rear of the
</p>
<p>fort. Each savage was painted black, and each
</p>
<p>bore a scalp fluttering from the end of a pole. It
</p>
<p>was but too clear that some new disaster had be
</p>
<p>fallen ; and in truth, before nightfall, one La Brosse
</p>
<p>a Canadian, came to the gate with the tidings that
</p>
<p>Fort Sandusky had been taken, and all its garrison
</p>
<p>slain or made captive. 1 This post had been attacked
</p>
<p>by the band of Wyandots living in its neighbor
</p>
<p>hood, aided by a detachment of their brethren from
</p>
<p>Detroit. Among the few survivors of the slaughter
</p>
<p>was the commanding officer, Ensign Paully, who
</p>
<p>had been brought prisoner to Detroit, bound hand
</p>
<p>and foot, and solaced on the passage with the ex-
</p>
<p>pectation of being burnt alive. On landing near
</p>
<p>the camp of Pontiac, he was surrounded by a crowd
</p>
<p>of Indians, chiefly squaws and children, who pelted
</p>
<p>him with stones, sticks, and gravel, forcing him to
</p>
<p>dance and sing, though by no means in a cheerful
</p>
<p>strain. A worse infliction seemed in store for him,
</p>
<p>when happily an old woman, whose husband had
</p>
<p>lately died, chose to adopt him in place of the
</p>
<p>deceased warrior. Seeing no alternative but the
</p>
<p>stake, Paully accepted the proposal ; and, having
</p>
<p>been first plunged in the river, that the white blood
</p>
<p>might be washed from his veins, he was conducted

<p>with all the consideration due to an Ottawa warrior.
</p>
<p>Gladwyn soon received a letter from him, through
</p>
<p>one of the Canadian inhabitants, giving a full
</p>
<p>account of the capture of Fort Sandusky. On the
</p>
<p>sixteenth of May  such was the substance of
</p>
<p>the communication  Panlly was informed that
</p>
<p>seven Indians were waiting at the gate to speak
</p>
<p>with him. As several of the number were well
</p>
<p>known to him, he ordered them, without hesitation,
</p>
<p>to be admitted. Arriving at his quarters, two of
</p>
<p>the treacherous visitors seated themselves on each
</p>
<p>side of the commandant, while the rest were dis
</p>
<p>posed in various parts of the room. The pipes
</p>
<p>were lighted, and the conversation began, when an
</p>
<p>Indian, who stood in the doorway, suddenly made
</p>
<p>a signal by raising his head. Upon this, the aston-
</p>
<p>ished officer was instantly pounced upon and
</p>
<p>disarmed ; while, at the same moment, a confused
</p>
<p>noise of shrieks and yells, the firing of guns, and
</p>
<p>the hurried tramp of feet, sounded from the area
</p>
<p>of the fort without. It soon ceased, however, and
</p>
<p>Paully, led by his captors from the room, saw the
</p>
<p>parade ground strown with the corpses of his mur-
</p>
<p>dered garrison. At nightfall, he was conducted to
</p>
<p>the margin of the lake, where several birch canoes
</p>
<p>lay in readiness ; and as, amid thick darkness, the
</p>
<p>party pushed out from shore, the captive saw the
</p>
<p>fort, lately under his command, bursting on all
</p>
<p>sides into sheets of flame. 1

<p>272 FATE OF TPIE FOREST GARRISONS. 1 1768, Jim.
</p>
<p>Soon after these tidings of the loss of Sandusky,
</p>
<p>Gladwyn's garrison heard the scarcely less unwel-
</p>
<p>come news that the strength of their besiegers had
</p>
<p>been re-enforced by two strong bands of Ojibwas.
</p>
<p>Pontiac's forces in the vicinity of Detroit now
</p>
<p>amounted, according to Canadian computation, to
</p>
<p>about eight hundred and twenty warriors. Of
</p>
<p>these, two hundred and fifty were Ottawas, com-
</p>
<p>manded by himself in person ; one hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty were Pottawattamies, under Ninivay ; fifty
</p>
<p>were Wyandots, under Takee ; two hundred were
</p>
<p>Ojibwas, under Wasson ; and added to these were
</p>
<p>a hundred and .seventy of the same tribe, under
</p>
<p>their chief, Sekahos. 1 As the warriors brought
</p>
<p>their squaws and children with them, the whole
</p>
<p>number of savages congregated about Detroit no
</p>
<p>doubt exceeded three thousand ; and the neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing fields and meadows must have presented a
</p>
<p>picturesque and stirring scene.
</p>
<p>The sleepless garrison, worn by fatigue and ill
</p>
<p>fare, and harassed by constant petty attacks, were
</p>
<p>yet farther saddened by the news of disaster which
</p>
<p>thickened from every quarter. Of all the small
</p>
<p>posts scattered at intervals through the vast wilder-
</p>
<p>ness to the westward of Niagara and Fort Pitt, it
</p>
<p>soon appeared that Detroit alone had been able to
</p>
<p>sustain itself. For the rest, there was but one
</p>
<p>unvaried tale of calamity and ruin. On the fif-
</p>
<p>teenth of June, a number of Pottawattamies were
</p>
<p>seen approaching the gate of the fort, bringing
</p>
<p>with them four English prisoners, who proved to

<p>be Ensign Schlosser, lately commanding at St,
</p>
<p>Joseph's, together with three private soldiers.
</p>
<p>The Indians wished to exchange them for several
</p>
<p>of their own tribe, who had been for nearly two
</p>
<p>months prisoners in the fort. After some delay,
</p>
<p>this was effected ; and the garrison then learned the
</p>
<p>unhappy fate of their comrades at St. Joseph's.
</p>
<p>This post stood at the mouth of the River St.
</p>
<p>Joseph's, near the head of Lake Michigan, a spot
</p>
<p>which had long been the site of a Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>mission. Here, among the forests, swamps, and
</p>
<p>ocean-like waters, at an unmeasured distance from
</p>
<p>any abode of civilized man, the indefatigable Jesuits
</p>
<p>had labored more than half a century for the
</p>
<p>spiritual good of the Pottawattamies, who lived
</p>
<p>in great numbers near the margin of the lake.
</p>
<p>As early as the year 1712, as Father Marest
</p>
<p>informs us, the mission was in a thriving state,
</p>
<p>and around it had gathered a little colony of the
</p>
<p>forest-loving Canadians. Here, too, the French
</p>
<p>government had established a military post, whose
</p>
<p>garrison, at the period of our narrative, had been
</p>
<p>supplanted by Ensign Schlosser, with his command
</p>
<p>of fourteen men, a mere handful, in the heart of
</p>
<p>a wilderness swarming with insidious enemies.
</p>
<p>They seem, however, to have apprehended no
</p>
<p>danger, when, on the twenty-fifth of May, early in
</p>
<p>the morning, the officer was informed that a large
</p>
<p>party of the Pottawattamies of Detroit had come
</p>
<p>to pay a visit to their relatives at St. Joseph's.

<p>friendly " talk ;" and immediately after a Canadian
</p>
<p>came in with intelligence that the fort was sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by Indians, who evidently had hostile
</p>
<p>intentions. At this. Schlosser ran out of the apart-
</p>
<p>ment, and crossing the parade, w r hich was full of
</p>
<p>Indians and Canadians, hastily entered the barracks,
</p>
<p>These were also crowded with savages, very inso
</p>
<p>lent and disorderly. Calling upon his sergeant to
</p>
<p>get the men under arms, he hastened out again
</p>
<p>to the parade, and endeavored to muster the
</p>
<p>Canadians together; but while busying himself
</p>
<p>with these somewhat unwilling auxiliaries, he
</p>
<p>heard a wild cry from within the barracks. In-
</p>
<p>stantly all the Indians in the fort rushed to the
</p>
<p>gate, tomahawked the sentinel, and opened a free
</p>
<p>passage to their comrades without. In less than
</p>
<p>two minutes, as the officer declares, the fort was
</p>
<p>plundered, eleven men were killed, and himself,
</p>
<p>with the three survivors, made prisoners, and
</p>
<p>bound fast. They then conducted him to Detroit,
</p>
<p>where he was exchanged as we have already

<p> 763, June j LETTER FROM CAPT. ETHERES'GTON. % 2 13
</p>
<p>Three days after these tidings reached Detroit^
</p>
<p>Father Jonois, a Jesuit- priest of the Ottawa mis-
</p>
<p>sion near Michillimackinac, came to Pontiac's camp,
</p>
<p>together with the son of Minavavana, great chief
</p>
<p>of the Ojibwas, and several other Indians. On the
</p>
<p>following morning, he appeared at the gate of the
</p>
<p>fort, bringing a letter from Captain Etherington,
</p>
<p>commandant at Michillimackinac. The commence-
</p>
<p>ment of the letter was as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Michillimackinac, 12 June, 1763.
</p>
<p>" Sir :
</p>
<p>" Notwithstanding what I wrote you in my last,
</p>
<p>that all the savages were arrived, and that every
</p>
<p>thing seemed in perfect tranquillity, yet on the
</p>
<p>second instant the Chippeways, who live in a plain
</p>
<p>near this fort, assembled to play ball, as they had
</p>
<p>done almost every day since their arrival. They
</p>
<p>played from morning till noon ; then, throwing
</p>
<p>their ball close to the gate, and observing Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant Lesley and me a few paces out of it, they
</p>
<p>came behind us, seized and carried us into the
</p>
<p>woods.
</p>
<p>" In the mean time, the rest rushed into the fort,
</p>
<p>where they found their squaws, whom they had
</p>
<p>previously planted there, with their hatchets hid
</p>
<p>under their blankets, which they took, and in an
</p>
<p>instant killed Lieutenant Jamet, and fifteen rank
</p>
<p>and file, and a trader named Tracy. They wounded
</p>
<p>two, and took the rest of the garrison prisoners,
</p>
<p>five of whom they have since killed.
</p>
<p>" They made prisoners all the English traders,

<p>and robbed them of every thing they had ; but they
</p>
<p>276 FATE OF THE FOREST GARRISONS [1763, Junb
</p>
<p>offered no violence to the persons or property of
</p>
<p>any of the Frenchmen."
</p>
<p>Captain Etherington next related some particu-
</p>
<p>lars of the massacre at Michillimackinac, sufficiently
</p>
<p>startling, as will soon appear. He spoke in high
</p>
<p>terms of the character and conduct of Father
</p>
<p>Jonois, and requested that Gladwyn would send
</p>
<p>all the troops he could spare up Lake Huron, that
</p>
<p>the post might be recaptured from the Indians, and
</p>
<p>garrisoned afresh. Gladwyn, being scarcely able to
</p>
<p>defend himself, could do nothing for the relief of
</p>
<p>his brother officer, and the Jesuit set out on his
</p>
<p>long and toilsome canoe voyage back to Michilli-
</p>
<p>mackinac. 1 The loss of this place was a very
</p>
<p>serious misfortune, for, next to Detroit, it was the
</p>
<p>most important post on the upper lakes.
</p>
<p>The next news which came in was that of the
</p>
<p>loss of Ouatanon, a fort situated upon the Wabash,
</p>
<p>a little below the site of the present town of La
</p>
<p>Fayette. Gladwyn received a letter from its com-
</p>
<p>manding officer, Lieutenant Jenkins, informing
</p>
<p>him that, on the first of June, he and several of
</p>
<p>his men had been made prisoners by stratagem, on
</p>
<p>which the rest of the garrison had surrendered.
</p>
<p>The Indians, however, apologized for their con-
</p>
<p>duct, declaring that they acted contrary to their
</p>
<p>own inclinations, and that the surrounding tribes
</p>
<p>compelled them to take up the hatchet. 2 These

</p>
<p>excuses, so consolatory to the sufferers, might prob-
</p>
<p>ably have been founded in truth, for these savages
</p>
<p>were of a character less ferocious than many of the
</p>
<p>others, and as they were farther removed from the
</p>
<p>settlements, they had not felt to an equal degree
</p>
<p>the effects of English insolence and encroachment.
</p>
<p>Close upon these tidings came the news that
</p>
<p>Fort Miami was taken. This post, standing on the
</p>
<p>Biver Maumee, was commanded by Ensign Holmes.
</p>
<p>And here I cannot but remark on the forlorn situa-
</p>
<p>tion of these officers, isolated in the wilderness,
</p>
<p>hundreds of miles, in some instances, from any
</p>
<p>congenial associates, separated from every human
</p>
<p>being except the rude soldiers under their corn-
</p>
<p>speak to me, and Immediately bound me, when I got to their Cabbin, and
</p>
<p>I soon found some of my Soldiers in the same Condition : They told me
</p>
<p>Detroit, Miamis, and all them Posts were cut off, and that it was a Folly
</p>
<p>to make any Resistance, therefore desired me to make the few Soldiers,
</p>
<p>that were in the Fort, surrender, otherwise they would put us all to
</p>
<p>Death, in case one man was killed. They were to have tell on us and
</p>
<p>killed us all, last night, but Mr. Maisongville and Lorain gave them wam-
</p>
<p>pum not to kill us, & when they told the Interpreter that we were all to
</p>
<p>be killed, & he knowing the condition of the Fort, beg'd of them to make
</p>
<p>us prisoners. They have put us into French houses, & both Indians and
</p>
<p>French use us very well : All' these Nations say they are very sorry, but
</p>
<p>that they were obliged to do it by the Other Nations. The Belt did not
</p>
<p>Arrive here 'till last night about Eight o'Clock. Mr. Lorain can inform
</p>
<p>you of all Just now Received the News of St. Joseph's being taken,
</p>
<p>Eleven men killed and three taken Prisoners with the Officer : I have
</p>
<p>nothing more to say, but that I sincerely wish you a speedy succour, and
</p>
<p>that we may be able to Revenge ourselves on those that Deserve it.

</p>
<p>This expectation was not fulfilled, and Jenkins remained at Ouatanon.

<p>A. letter from him is before me, written from thence to Glaawyn >n the

<p>29th July, in which he complains that the Canadians were secretly adri

<p>mand and the white or red savages who ranged
</p>
<p>the surrounding woods. Holmes suspected the
</p>
<p>intention of the Indians, and was therefore on his
</p>
<p>guard, when, on the twenty-seventh of May, a
</p>
<p>young Indian girl, who lived with him, came to
</p>
<p>tell him that a squaw lay dangerously ill in a wig-
</p>
<p>warn near the fort, and urged him to come to h-er
</p>
<p>relief. Having confidence in the girl, Holmes for-
</p>
<p>got his caution and followed her out of the fort
</p>
<p>Pitched at the edge of a meadow, hidden from view
</p>
<p>by an intervening spur of the woodland, stood a
</p>
<p>great number of Indian wigwams. When Holmes
</p>
<p>came in sight of them, his treacherous conductress
</p>
<p>pointed out that in which the sick woman lay. He
</p>
<p>walked on without suspicion ; but, as he drew near,
</p>
<p>two guns flashed from behind the hut, and stretched
</p>
<p>him lifeless on the grass. The shots were heard at
</p>
<p>the fort, and the sergeant rashly went out to learn
</p>
<p>the reason of the firing. He was immediately taken
</p>
<p>prisoner, amid exulting yells and whoopings. The
</p>
<p>soldiers in the fort climbed upon the palisades, to
</p>
<p>look out, when Godefroy, a Canadian, and two other
</p>
<p>white men, made their appearance, and summoned
</p>
<p>them to surrender ; promising that, if they did so,
</p>
<p>their lives should be spared, but that otherwise they
</p>
<p>would all be killed without mercy. The men, being
</p>
<p>in great terror, and without a leader, soon threw Dpen
</p>
<p>the gate, and gave themselves up as prisoners. 1

</p>
<p>Had detachments of Rogers's Rangers garrisoned
</p>
<p>these posts, or had they been held by such men as
</p>
<p>the Rocky Mountain trappers of the present day,
</p>
<p>wary, skilful, and almost ignorant of fear, some of
</p>
<p>them might, perhaps, have been saved ; but the
</p>
<p>soldiers of the 60th Regiment, though many of
</p>
<p>them were of provincial birth, were not suited by-
</p>
<p>habits and discipline for this kind of service.
</p>
<p>The loss of Presqu' Isle will close this catalogue
</p>
<p>of calamity. Rumors of it first reached Detroit on
</p>
<p>the twentieth of June, and, two days after, the gar-
</p>
<p>rison heard those dismal cries announcing scalps
</p>
<p>and prisoners, which, of late, had grown mourn
</p>
<p>fully familiar to their ears. Indians were seen pass
</p>
<p>ing in numbers along the opposite bank of the river,
</p>
<p>leading several English prisoners, who proved to be
</p>
<p>Ensign Christie, the commanding officer at Presqu'
</p>
<p>Isle, with those of his soldiers who survived.
</p>
<p>On the third of June, Christie, then safely
</p>
<p>ensconced in the fort which he commanded, had
</p>
<p>written as follows to his superior officer, Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Gordon, at Venango : " This morning Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Cuyler of Queen's Company of Rangers came here,
</p>
<p>and gave me the following melancholy account of
</p>
<p>his whole party being cut off by a large body of
</p>
<p>Indians at the mouth of the Detroit River." Here
</p>
<p>follows the story of Cuyler's disaster, and Christie
</p>
<p>designs. At the mouth of the Maumee they met John Welsh, an English
</p>
<p>trader, with two canoes, hound for Detroit. They seized him, and divided
</p>
<p>his furs among themselves and a party of Indians who were with them
</p>
<p>They then proceeded to Fort Miami, and aided the Indians to capture it.
</p>
<p>Welsh was afterwards carried to Detroit, where the Ottawas murdered

<p>hounds. I have ordered everybody here to move

<p>come when they will."
</p>
<p>Fort Presqu Isle stood on the southern shore
</p>
<p>of Lake Erie, at the site of the present town of
</p>
<p>Erie. It was an important post to be commanded
</p>
<p>by an Ensign, for it controlled the communication
</p>
<p>between the lake and Fort Pitt; but the block-
</p>
<p>house, to which Christie alludes, was supposed to
</p>
<p>make it impregnable against Indians. This block-
</p>
<p>house, a very large and strong one, stood at an
</p>
<p>angle of the fort, and was built of massive logs,
</p>
<p>with the projecting upper story usual in such struct-
</p>
<p>ures, by means of which a vertical fire could be
</p>
<p>had upon the heads of assailants, through openings
</p>
<p>in the projecting part of the floor, like the ?nachi-
</p>
<p>coulis of a mediaeval castle. It had also a kind of
</p>
<p>bastion, from which one or more of its walls could
</p>
<p>be covered by a flank fire. The roof was of shin-
</p>
<p>gles, and might easily be set on fire ; but at the
</p>
<p>top was a sentry-box or look-out, from which water
</p>
<p>could be thrown. On one side was the lake, and
</p>
<p>on the other a small stream which entered it.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bank of this stream rose in a
</p>
<p>high steep ridge within forty yards of the block-
</p>
<p>house, 'thus affording a cover to assailants, while

</p>
<p>763,June.J FORT PRESQU' ISLE. 281
</p>
<p>After his visit from Cuyler, Christie, whose gar-
</p>
<p>rison now consisted of twenty-seven men, pre-
</p>
<p>pared for a stubborn defence. The doors of the
</p>
<p>block-house, and the sentry-box at the top, were
</p>
<p>lined to make them bullet-proof; the angles of
</p>
<p>the roof were covered with green turf as a pro
</p>
<p>tection against fire-arrows, and gutters of bark
</p>
<p>were laid in such a manner that streams of water
</p>
<p>could be sent to every part. His expectation of a
</p>
<p>" visit from the hell-hounds " proved to be perfectly
</p>
<p>well founded. About two hundred of them had
</p>
<p>left Detroit expressly for this object. At early
</p>
<p>dawn on the fifteenth of June, they were first dis
</p>
<p>covered stealthily crossing the mouth of the little
</p>
<p>stream, where the bateaux were drawn up, and
</p>
<p>crawling under cover of the banks of the lake and
</p>
<p>of the adjacent saw-pits. When the sun rose, they
</p>
<p>showed themselves, and began their customary yell-
</p>
<p>ing. Christie, with a very unnecessary reluctance
</p>
<p>to begin the fray, ordered his men not to fire till
</p>
<p>the Indians had set the example. The consequence
</p>
<p>was, that they were close to the blockhouse before
</p>
<p>they received the fire of the garrison; and many of
</p>
<p>them sprang into the ditch, whence, being well she!
</p>
<p>terecl, they fired at the loop-holes, and amused them-
</p>
<p>selves by throwing stones and handfuls of gravel, or,
</p>
<p>what was more to the purpose, fire-balls of pitch.
</p>
<p>Some got into the fort and sheltered themselves
</p>
<p>behind the bakery and other buildings, whence they
</p>
<p>kept up a brisk fire ; while others pulled down a
</p>
<p>small out-house of plank, of which they made a

</p>
<p>of it by pushing it before them. At the same time
</p>
<p>great numbers of them lay close behind the ridges
</p>
<p>by the stream, keeping up a rattling fire into every
</p>
<p>loophole, and shooting burning arrows against the
</p>
<p>roof and sides of the blockhouse. Some were
</p>
<p>extinguished with water, while many dropped out
</p>
<p>harmless after burning a small hole. The Indians
</p>
<p>now T rolled logs to the top of the ridges, where they
</p>
<p>made three strong breastworks, from behind which
</p>
<p>they could discharge their shot and throw their
</p>
<p>ire works with greater effect. Sometimes they
</p>
<p>would try to dart across the intervening space
</p>
<p>and shelter themselves with their companions in
</p>
<p>the ditch, but all who attempted it were killed or
</p>
<p>wounded. And now the hard-beset little garrison
</p>
<p>could see them throwing up earth and stones behind
</p>
<p>the nearest breastwork. Their implacable foes
</p>
<p>were undermining the blockhouse. There was
</p>
<p>little time to reflect on this new danger ; for
</p>
<p>another, more imminent, soon threatened them..
</p>
<p>The barrels of water, always kept in the build
</p>
<p>ing, were nearly emptied in extinguishing the
</p>
<p>frequent fires ; and though there was a well close
</p>
<p>at hand, in the parade ground, it was death to
</p>
<p>approach it. The only resource was to dig a sub-
</p>
<p>terranean passage to it. The floor was torn up ;
</p>
<p>and while some of the men fired their heated
</p>
<p>muskets from the loopholes, the rest labored
</p>
<p>stoutly at this cheerless task. Before it w 7 as half
</p>
<p>finished, the roof was on fire again, and all the
</p>
<p>water that remained was poured down to extin-

</p>
<p>again raised, when a soldier, at imminent risk of
</p>
<p>his life, tore off the burning shingles and averted
</p>
<p>the danger.
</p>
<p>By this time it was evening. The garrison had
</p>
<p>had not a moment's rest since the sun rose. Dark-
</p>
<p>ness brought little relief, for guns flashed all night
</p>
<p>from the Indian intrenchments. In the mornings
</p>
<p>however, there was a respite. The Indians were
</p>
<p>ominously quiet, being employed, it seems, in push-
</p>
<p>ing their subterranean approaches, and preparing
</p>
<p>fresh means for firing the blockhouse. In the
</p>
<p>afternoon the attack began again. They set fire
</p>
<p>to the house of the commanding officer, which stood
</p>
<p>close at hand, and which they had reached by mean3
</p>
<p>of their trenches. The pine logs blazed fiercely,
</p>
<p>and the wind blew the flame against the bastion of
</p>
<p>the blockhouse, which scorched, blackened, and at
</p>
<p>last took fire ; but the garrison had by this time
</p>
<p>dug a passage to the well, and, half stifled as they
</p>
<p>were, they plied their water-buckets with such good
</p>
<p>will that the fire was subdued, while the blazing
</p>
<p>house soon sank to a glowing pile of embers. The
</p>
<p>men, who had behaved throughout with great spirit,
</p>
<p>were now, in the words of their officer, " exhausted
</p>
<p>to the greatest extremity ; " yet they still kept up
</p>
<p>their forlorn defence, toiling and fighting without
</p>
<p>pause within the wooden walls of their dim prison,
</p>
<p>where the close and heated air was thick with the
</p>
<p>smoke of gunpowder. The filing on both sides
</p>
<p>lasted through the rest of the day, and did net cease
</p>
<p>till midnight, at which hour a voice was heard to

</p>
<p>warning the garrison that farther resistance would
</p>
<p>be useless, since preparations were made for setting
</p>
<p>the blockhouse on fire, above and below at once.
</p>
<p>Christie demanded if there were any among them
</p>
<p>who spoke English ; upon which, a man in the
</p>
<p>Indian dress came out from behind the breastwork.
</p>
<p>He was a soldier, who, having been made pris-
</p>
<p>oner early in the French war, had since lived
</p>
<p>among the savages, and now espoused their cause,
</p>
<p>fighting with them against his own countrymen.
</p>
<p>He said that if they yielded, their lives should be
</p>
<p>spared ; but if they fought longer, they must all be
</p>
<p>burnt alive. Christie told them to wait till morn
</p>
<p>ing for his answer. They assented, and suspended
</p>
<p>their fire. Christie now asked his men, if we may
</p>
<p>believe the testimony of two of them, " whether
</p>
<p>they chose to give up the blockhouse, or remain
</p>
<p>in it and be burnt alive'?" They replied that they
</p>
<p>would stay as long as they could bear the heat, and
</p>
<p>then fight their way through. 1 A third witness,
</p>
<p>Edward Smyth, apparently a corporal, testifies that
</p>
<p>all but two of them were for holding out. He says
</p>
<p>that when his opinion was asked, he replied that,
</p>

<p>(7G3. Juxb.J SURRENDER OF THE BLOCKHOUSE. 285
</p>
<p>When morning came, Christie sent out two sol-
</p>
<p>diers as if to treat with the enemy, but, in reality,
</p>
<p>as he says, to learn the truth of what they had
</p>
<p>told him respecting their preparations to burn
</p>
<p>the blockhouse. On reaching the breastwork, the
</p>
<p>soldiers made a signal, by which their officer saw
</p>
<p>that his worst fears were well founded. In pur
</p>
<p>suance of their orders, they then demanded that
</p>
<p>two of the principal chiefs should meet with
</p>
<p>Christie midway between the breastwork and the
</p>
<p>blockhouse. The chiefs appeared accordingly ; and
</p>
<p>Christie, going out, yielded up the blockhouse ; hav-
</p>
<p>ing first stipulated that the lives of all the garrison
</p>
<p>should be spared, and that they might retire unmo
</p>
<p>lested to the nearest post. The soldiers, pale and
</p>
<p>haggard, like men who had passed through a fiery
</p>
<p>ordeal, now issued from their scorched and bullet-
</p>
<p>pierced stronghold. A scene of plunder instantly
</p>
<p>began. Benjamin Gray, a Scotch soldier, who had
</p>
<p>just been employed, on Christie's order, in carrying
</p>
<p>presents to the Indians, seeing the confusion, and
</p>
<p>hearing a scream from a sergeant's wife, the only
</p>
<p>woman in the garrison, sprang off into the woods
</p>
<p>and succeeded in making his way to Fort Pitt with
</p>
<p>news of the disaster. It is needless to say that no
</p>
<p>faith was kept with the rest, and they had good cause
</p>
<p>to be thankful that they were not butchered on the
</p>
<p>spot. After being detained for some time in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood, they were carried prisoners to De-
</p>
<p>troit, where Christie soon after made his escape,
</p>
<p>and gained the fort in safety. 1

</p>
<p>TIIE INDIANS CONTINUE TO BLOCKADE DETROIT.
</p>
<p>We return once more to Detroit and its belea
</p>
<p>guered garrison. On the nineteenth of June, a
</p>
<p>rumor reached them that one of the vessels had
</p>
<p>been seen neai Turkey Island, some miles below
</p>
<p>the fort, but that, the wind failing her, she had
</p>
<p>dropped down with the current, to wait a more
</p>
<p>favorable opportunity. It may be remembered
</p>
<p>that this vessel had, several weeks before, gone
</p>
<p>down Lake Erie to hasten the advance of Cuyler's
</p>
<p>expected detachment. Passing these troops on her
</p>
<p>way, she had held her course to Niagara ; and here
</p>
<p>she had remained until the return of Cuyler, with
</p>
<p>the remnant of his men, made known the catas-
</p>
<p>trophe that had befallen him. This officer, and
</p>
<p>the survivors of his party, with a few other troops
</p>
<p>spared from the garrison of Niagara, were ordered
</p>
<p>to embark in her, and make the best of their way
</p>
<p>back to Detroit. They had done so, and now, as
</p>
<p>we have seen, were almost within sight of the fort ;
</p>
<p>but the critical part of the undertaking yet re-

<p>mained. The river channel was in some place

</p>
<p>narrow, and more than eight hundred Indians were
</p>
<p>on the alert to intercept their passage.
</p>
<p>For several days, the officers at Detroit heard
</p>
<p>nothing farther of the vessel, when, on the twenty-
</p>
<p>third, a great commotion was visible among the
</p>
<p>Indians, large parties of whom were seen to pass
</p>
<p>along the outskirts of the woods, behind the fort.
</p>
<p>The cause of these movements was unknown till
</p>
<p>evening, when M. Baby came in with intelligence
</p>
<p>that the vessel was again attempting to ascend the
</p>
<p>river, and that all the Indians had gone to attack
</p>
<p>her. Upon this, two cannon were fired, that those
</p>
<p>on board might know that the fort still held out.
</p>
<p>This done, all remained in much anxiety awaiting
</p>
<p>the result.
</p>
<p>The schooner, late that afternoon, began to move
</p>
<p>slowly upward, with a gentle breeze, between the
</p>
<p>main shore and the long-extended margin of Fight-
</p>
<p>ing Island. About sixty men were crowded on
</p>
<p>board, of whom only ten or twelve were visible on
</p>
<p>deck ; the officer having ordered the rest to lie hid-
</p>
<p>den below, in hope that the Indians, encouraged by
</p>
<p>this apparent weakness, might make an open attack.
</p>
<p>Just before reaching the narrowest part of the
</p>
<p>channel, the wind died away, and the anchor was
</p>
<p>dropped. Immediately above, and within gunshot
</p>
<p>of the vessel, the Indians had made a breastwork
</p>
<p>of logs, carefully concealed by bushes, on the
</p>
<p>shore of Turkey Island. Here they lay in force,
</p>
<p>waiting for the schooner to pass. Ignorant of this,
</p>
<p>but still cautious and wary, the crew kept a strict

</p>
<p>Hours wore on, and nothing ha:l broken the
</p>
<p>deep repose of the night. The current gurgled
</p>
<p>with a monotonous sound around the bows of the
</p>
<p>schooner, and on either hand the wooded shores
</p>
<p>lay amid the obscurity, black and silent as the
</p>
<p>grave. At length, the sentinel could discern, in
</p>
<p>the distance, various moving objects upon the dark
</p>
<p>surface of the water. The men were ordered up
</p>
<p>from below, and all took their posts in perfect
</p>
<p>silence. The blow of a hammer on the mast was
</p>
<p>to be the signal to fire. The Indians, gliding
</p>
<p>stealthily over the water in their birch canoes,
</p>
<p>had, by this time, approached within a few rods
</p>
<p>of their fancied prize, when suddenly the dark side
</p>
<p>of the slumbering vessel burst into a blaze of can-
</p>
<p>non and musketry, which illumined the night like
</p>
<p>a flash of lightning. Grape and musket shot
</p>
<p>flew tearing among the canoes, destroying several
</p>
<p>of them, killing fourteen Indians, wounding as
</p>
<p>many more, and driving the rest in consternation
</p>
<p>to the shore. 1 Recovering from their surprise, they
</p>
<p>began to fire upon the vessel from behind their
</p>
<p>breastwork ; upon which she weighed anchor, and
</p>
<p>dropped down once more beyond their reach, into
</p>
<p>the broad river below. Several days afterwards,
</p>
<p>she again attempted to ascend. This time, she met
</p>
<p>with better success ; for, though the Indians fired
</p>
<p>at her constantly from the shore, no man was hurt,
</p>
<p>and at length she left behind her the perilous chan-
</p>
<p>nels of the Islands. As she passed the Wyandot

</p>
<p>then, furling her sails, lay peacefully at anchor by
</p>
<p>the side of her companion vessel, abreast of the
</p>
<p>fort.
</p>
<p>The schooner brought to the garrison a much
</p>
<p>needed supply of men, ammunition, and provisions,
</p>
<p>She brought, also, the important tidings that peace
</p>
<p>was at length concluded between France and Eng-
</p>
<p>land. The bloody and momentous struggle of the
</p>
<p>French war, which had shaken North America
</p>
<p>since the year 1755, had indeed been virtually
</p>
<p>closed by the victory on the Plains of Abraham,
</p>
<p>and the junction of the three British armies at
</p>
<p>Montreal. Yet up to this time, its embers had
</p>
<p>continued to burn, till at length peace was com-
</p>
<p>pletely established by formal treaty between the
</p>
<p>hostile powers. France resigned her ambitious
</p>
<p>project of empire in America, and ceded Canada
</p>
<p>and the region of the lakes to her successful rival.
</p>
<p>By this treaty, the Canadians of Detroit were placed
</p>
<p>in a new position. Hitherto they had been, as it
</p>
<p>were, prisoners on capitulation, neutral spectators
</p>
<p>of the quarrel between their British conquerors
</p>
<p>and the Indians ; but now their allegiance was
</p>
<p>transferred from the crown of France to that of
</p>
<p>Britain, and they were subjects of the English
</p>
<p>king. To many of them the change was extremely
</p>
<p>odious, for they cordially hated the British. They
</p>
<p>went about among the settlers and the Indians,

</p>
<p>that a great French army was even then ascending
</p>
<p>the St. Lawrence, while another was approaching
</p>
<p>from the country of the Illinois. 1 This oft -repeated
</p>
<p>falsehood was implicitly believed by the Indians,
</p>
<p>who continued firm in the faith that their Great
</p>
<p>Father was about to awake from his sleep, and
</p>
<p>wreak his vengeance upon the insolent English,
</p>
<p>who had intruded on his domain.
</p>
<p>Pontiac himself clung fast to this delusive hope;
</p>
<p>yet he was greatly vexed at the safe arrival of the
</p>
<p>vessel, and the assistance she had brought to the
</p>
<p>obstinate defenders of Detroit. He exerted him-
</p>
<p>self with fresh zeal to gain possession of the place.
</p>
<p>and attempted to terrify Gladwyn into submission.
</p>
<p>He sent a message, in which he strongly urged him
</p>
<p>to surrender, adding, by way of stimulus, that eight
</p>
<p>hundred more Ojibwas were every day expected,
</p>
<p>and that, on their arrival, all his influence could
</p>
<p>not prevent them from taking the scalp of every
</p>
<p>Englishman in the fort. To this friendly advice
</p>
<p>Gladwyn returned a brief and contemptuous an-
</p>
<p>swer.
</p>
<p>Pontiac, having long been anxious to gain the
</p>
<p>Canadians as auxiliaries in the war, now deter-
</p>
<p>mined on a final effort to effect his object. For
</p>
<p>this purpose, he sent messages to the principal
</p>
<p>inhabitants, inviting them to meet him in council.
</p>
<p>In the Ottawa camp, there was a vacant spot, quite
</p>
<p>level, and encircled by the huts of the Indians.

<p>Here mats were spread for the reception of the

<p>in a wide ring. One part was occupied by the
</p>
<p>Canadians, among whom were several whose with-
</p>
<p>ered, leathery features proclaimed them the patri-
</p>
<p>archs of the secluded little settlement. Opposite
</p>
<p>these sat the stern-visaged Pontiac, with his chiefs
</p>
<p>on either hand, while the intervening portions of
</p>
<p>the circle were filled by Canadians and Indians
</p>
<p>promiscuously mingled. Standing on the outside,
</p>
<p>and looking over the heads of this more dignified
</p>
<p>assemblage, was a motley throng of Indians and
</p>
<p>Canadians, half breeds, trappers, and voyageurs,
</p>
<p>in wild and picturesque, though very dirty attire,
</p>
<p>Conspicuous among them were numerous Indian
</p>
<p>dandies, a large class in every aboriginal com-
</p>
<p>munity, where they hold about the same relative
</p>
<p>position as do their counterparts in civilized society.
</p>
<p>They were wrapped in the gayest blankets, their
</p>
<p>necks adorned with beads, their cheeks daubed with
</p>
<p>vermilion, and their ears hung with pendants. They
</p>
<p>stood sedately looking on, with evident self-compla-
</p>
<p>cency, yet ashamed and afraid to take their places
</p>
<p>among the aged chiefs and warriors of repute.
</p>
<p>All was silent, and several pipes were passing
</p>
<p>round from hand to hand, whenTontiac rose, and
</p>
<p>threw down a war-belt at the feet of the Canadians.

<p>we, wish to oppose his will. Until now I have
</p>
<p>said nothing on this matter. I have not urged you
</p>
<p>to take part with us in the war. It would have
</p>
<p>been enough had you been content to sit quiet on
</p>
<p>your mats, looking on, while we were fighting for
</p>
<p>you. But you have not done so. You call your-
</p>
<p>selves our friends, and yet you assist the English
</p>
<p>with provisions, and go about as spies among our
</p>
<p>villages. This must not continue. You must be
</p>
<p>either wholly French or wholly English. If you
</p>
<p>are French, take up that war-belt, and lift the
</p>
<p>hatchet with us ; but if you are English, then we
</p>
<p>declare war upon you. My brothers, I know this
</p>
<p>is a hard thing. We are all alike children of our
</p>
<p>Great Father the King of France, and it is hard to
</p>
<p>fight among brethren for the sake of dogs. But
</p>
<p>there is no choice. Look upon the belt, and let us

<p>hear your answer." 1
</p>
<p>One of the Canadians, having suspected the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of Pontiac, had brought with him, not the
</p>
<p>treaty of peace, but a copy of the capitulation of
</p>
<p>Montreal with its dependencies, including Detroit.
</p>
<p>Pride, or some other motive, restrained him from
</p>
<p>confessing that the Canadians were no longer chil-
</p>
<p>dren of the King of France, and he determined to
</p>
<p>keep up the old delusion that a French army was
</p>
<p>on its way to win back Canada, and chastise the
</p>
<p>English invaders. lie began his speech in reply

<p>to Pontiac by professing great love for the Indians,

<p>In this paper, he tells all his Canadian children to

<p>because he wishes to punish his enemies himself,

<p>you should raise the hatchet against his French

</p>
<p>Pontiac for a moment sat silent, mortified, and
</p>
<p>perplexed ; but his purpose was not destined to be
</p>
<p>wholly defeated. " Among the French," says the
</p>
<p>writer of the diary, " were many infamous charac-

<p>geurs, and nondescript vagabonds of the forest,
</p>
<p>who were seated with the council, or stood look

<p>ing on, variously attired in greasy shirts, Indian

<p>them, however, had thought proper to adopt the

</p>
<p>hatchet for Pontiac. The better class of Cana-
</p>
<p>dians were shocked at this proceeding, and vainly
</p>
<p>protested against it. Pontiac, on his part, was
</p>
<p>ranch pleased at such an accession to his forces,
</p>
<p>and he and his chiefs shook hands, in turn, with
</p>
<p>each of their new auxiliaries. The council had
</p>
<p>been protracted to a late hour. It was dark before
</p>
<p>the assembly dissolved, " so that," as the chronicler
</p>
<p>observes, " these new Indians had no opportunity
</p>
<p>of displaying their exploits that day." They re-
</p>
<p>mained in the Indian camp all night, being afraid
</p>
<p>of the reception they might meet among their
</p>
<p>fellow-whites in the settlement. The whole of
</p>
<p>the following morning was employed in giving them
</p>
<p>a feast of welcome. For this entertainment a large
</p>
<p>number of dogs were killed, and served up to the
</p>
<p>guests ; none of whom, according to the Indian
</p>
<p>custom on such formal occasions, were permitted
</p>
<p>to take their leave until they had eaten the whole
</p>
<p>of the enormous portion placed before them.
</p>
<p>Pontiac derived little advantage from his Cana

<p>dian allies, most of whom, fearing the resentment
</p>
<p>of the English and the other inhabitants, fled, be-
</p>
<p>fore the war was over, to the country of the Illinois. 1
</p>
<p>On the night succeeding the feast, a party of the
</p>
<p>renegades, joined by about an equal number of
</p>
<p>Indians, approached the fort, and intrenched them-
</p>
<p>selves, in order to fire upon the garrison. At day-

</p>
<p>out much difficulty. The Canadians fled with such
</p>
<p>despatch, that all of them escaped unhurt, though
</p>
<p>two of the Indians were shot.
</p>
<p>It happened that among the English was a
</p>
<p>soldier who had been prisoner, for several years,
</p>
<p>among the Delawares, and who, while he had
</p>
<p>learned to hate the whole race, at the same time
</p>
<p>had acquired many of their habits and practices.
</p>
<p>He now ran forward, and, kneeling on the body of
</p>
<p>one of the dead savages, tore away the scalp, and
</p>
<p>shook it, with an exultant cry, towards the fugitives. 1
</p>
<p>This act, as afterwards appeared, excited great rage
</p>
<p>among the Indians.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hay and his party, after their suc-
</p>
<p>cessful sally, had retired to the fort ; when, at
</p>
<p>about four o'clock in the afternoon, a man was seen
</p>
<p>running towards it, closely pursued by Indians.
</p>
<p>On his arriving within gunshot, they gave over the
</p>
<p>chase, and the fugitive came panting beneath the
</p>
<p>stockade, where a wicket was flung open to receive
</p>
<p>him. He proved to be the commandant of San-
</p>
<p>dusky, who, having, as before mentioned, been
</p>
<p>adopted by the Indians, and married to an old
</p>
<p>squaw, now seized the first opportunity of escap-
</p>
<p>ing from her embraces.
</p>
<p>Through him, the garrison learned the unhappy
</p>
<p>tidings that Captain Campbell was killed. This
</p>
<p>gentleman, from his high personal character, no
</p>
<p>less than his merit as an officer, was held in
</p>
<p>general esteem ; and his fate excited a feeling

<p>of angei and grief among all the English in
</p>
<p>Detroit. It appeared that the Indian killed and
</p>
<p>scalped, in the skirmish of that morning was
</p>
<p>nephew to Wasson, chief of the Ojibwas. On
</p>
<p>hearing of his death, the enraged uncle had im-
</p>
<p>mediately blackened his face in sign of revenge,
</p>
<p>called together a party of his followers, and repair
</p>
<p>ing to th>, house of Meloche, where Captain Cam}
</p>
<p>bell was kept prisoner, had seized upon him, and
</p>
<p>bound him fast to a neighboring fence, where they
</p>
<p>shot him to death with arrows. Others say that
</p>
<p>they tomahawked him on the spot ; but all agree
</p>
<p>that his body was mutilated in a barbarous manner.
</p>
<p>His heart is said to have been eaten by his mur
</p>
<p>derers, to make them courageous ; a practice net
</p>
<p>uncommon among Indians, after killing an enemy
</p>
<p>of acknowledged bravery. The corpse was thrown
</p>
<p>into the river, and afterwards brought to shore and
</p>
<p>buried by the Canadians. According to one author-
</p>
<p>ity, Pontiac was privy to this act ; but a second,
</p>
<p>equally credible, represents him as ignorant of it,
</p>
<p>and declares that Wasson fled to Saginaw to escape
</p>
<p>his fury ; while a third affirms that the Ojibwas
</p>
<p>carried off Campbell by force from before the eyes
</p>
<p>of the great chief. 1 The other captive, M'Dougal,

<p>had previously escaped.

</p>
<p>The two armed schooners, anchored opposite the
</p>
<p>fort, were now become objects of awe and aversion
</p>
<p>to the Indians. This is not to be wondered at, for,
</p>
<p>besides aiding in the defence of the place, by sweep-
</p>
<p>ing "two sides of it with their fire, they often caused
</p>
<p>great terror and annoyance to the besiegers. Sev
</p>
<p>eral times they had left their anchorage, and, taking
</p>
<p>up a convenient position, had battered the Indian
</p>
<p>camps and villages with no little effect. Once in
</p>
<p>particular,  and this was the first attempt of the
</p>
<p>kind,  Gladwyn himself, with several of his offi-
</p>
<p>cers, had embarked on board the smaller vessel,
</p>
<p>while a fresh breeze was blowing from the north-
</p>
<p>west. The Indians, on the banks, stood watching
</p>
<p>her as she tacked from shore to shore, and pressed
</p>
<p>their hands against their mouths in amazement,
</p>
<p>thinking that magic power alone could enable her
</p>
<p>thus to make her way against wind and current. 1
</p>
<p>Making a long reach from the opposite shore, she
</p>
<p>came on directly towards the camp of Pontiac, her
</p>
<p>sails swelling, her masts leaning over till the black
</p>
<p>muzzles of her guns almost touched the river. The
</p>
<p>Indians watched her in astonishment. On she
</p>
<p>came, till their fierce hearts exulted in the idea
</p>
<p>that she would run ashore within their clutches,
</p>
<p>when suddenly a shout of command was heard on
</p>
<p>board, her progress was arrested, she rose upright,
</p>
<p>and her sails flapped and fluttered as if tearing

</p>
<p>round, broadside to the shore ; then, leaning once
</p>
<p>more to the wind, bore away gallantly on the other
</p>
<p>tack. She did not go far. The wondering specta-
</p>
<p>tors, quite at a loss to understand her movements,
</p>
<p>soon heard the hoarse rattling of her cable, as the
</p>
<p>anchor dragged it out, and saw her furling her vast
</p>
<p>white wings. As they looked unsuspectingly on,
</p>
<p>a puff of smoke was emitted from her side ; a loud
</p>
<p>report followed ; then another and another ; and
</p>
<p>he balls, rushing over their heads, flew through
</p>
<p>the midst of their camp, and tore wildly among the
</p>
<p>forest-trees beyond. All was terror and consterna-
</p>
<p>tion. The startled warriors bounded away on all
</p>
<p>sides ; the squaws snatched up their children, and
</p>
<p>fled screaming ; and, with a general chorus of yells,
</p>
<p>the whole encampment scattered in such haste, that
</p>
<p>little damage was done, except knocking to pieces
</p>
<p>their frail cabins of bark. 1
</p>
<p>This attack was followed by others of a similar
</p>
<p>kind ; and now the Indians seemed resolved to turn
</p>
<p>all their energies to the destruction of the vessel
</p>
<p>which caused them such annoyance. On the night
</p>
<p>of the tenth of July, they sent down a blazing raft,
</p>
<p>formed of two boats, secured together with a rope,
</p>
<p>and filled with pitch-pine, birch-bark, and other
</p>
<p>combastibles, which, by good fortune, missed the

<p>vessel, and floated down the stream without doing

<p>injury. All was quiet throughout the following

<p>spark of fire on the surface of the river, at some
</p>
<p>distance above. It grew larger and brighter ; it
</p>
<p>rose in a forked flame, and at length burst forth
</p>
<p>into a broad conflagration. In this instance, too,
</p>
<p>fortune favored the vessel ; for the raft, which was
</p>
<p>larger than the former, passed down between her
</p>
<p>and the fort, brightly gilding her tracery of ropes
</p>
<p>and spars, lighting up the old palisades and bastions
</p>
<p>of Detroit, disclosing the white Canadian farms and
</p>
<p>houses along the shore, and revealing the dusky
</p>
<p>margin of the forest behind. It showed, too, a
</p>
<p>dark group of naked spectators, who stood on the
</p>
<p>bank to watch the effect of their artifice, when &
</p>
<p>cannon flashed, a loud report broke the stillness,
</p>
<p>and before the smoke of the gun had risen, these
</p>
<p>curious observers had vanished. The raft floated
</p>
<p>down, its flames crackling and glaring wide through
</p>
<p>the night, until it was burnt to the water's edge,
</p>
<p>and its last hissing embers were quenched in the
</p>
<p>river.
</p>
<p>Though twice defeated, the Indians would not
</p>
<p>abandon their plan, but, soon after this second
</p>
<p>failure, began another raft, of different construction
</p>
<p>from the former, and so large that they thought it
</p>
<p>certain to take effect. Gladwyn, on his part, pro-
</p>
<p>vided boats which were moored by chains at some
</p>
<p>distance above the vessels, and made other prepar
</p>
<p>ations of defence, so effectual that the Indians, after
</p>
<p>working four days upon the raft, gave over their
</p>
<p>undertaking as useless. About this time, a party

<p>salute of musketry, which occasioned so rue alarm
</p>
<p>among the English, who knew nothing of its cause.
</p>
<p>They reported the progress of the war in the south
</p>
<p>and east ; and, a few days after, an Abenaki, from
</p>
<p>Lower Canada, also made* his appearance, bringing
</p>
<p>to the Indians the flattering falsehood that their
</p>
<p>Great Father, the King of France, was at that
</p>
<p>moment advancing up the St. Lawrence with his
</p>
<p>army. It may here be observed, that the name of
</p>
<p>Father, given to the Kings of France and England,
</p>
<p>was a mere title of courtesy or policy ; for, in his
</p>
<p>haughty independence, the Indian yields submission
</p>
<p>to no man.
</p>
<p>It was now between two and three months since
</p>
<p>the siege began ; and if one is disposed to think
</p>
<p>slightingly of the warriors whose numbers could
</p>
<p>avail so little against a handful of half-starved Eng-
</p>
<p>lish and provincials, he has only to recollect, that
</p>
<p>where barbarism has been arrayed against civiliza-
</p>
<p>tion, disorder against discipline, and ungoverned
</p>
<p>fury against considerate valor, such has seldom
</p>
<p>failed to be the result.
</p>
<p>I At the siege of Detroit, the Indians displayed a
</p>
<p>nigh degree of comparative steadiness and perse-
</p>
<p>verance ; and their history cannot furnish anothei
</p>
<p>v instance of so large a force persisting so long in
</p>
<p>the attack of a fortified place. Their good con-
</p>
<p>duct may be ascribed to their deep rage against the
</p>
<p>English, to their hope of speedy aid from the

<p>French, and to the controlling spirit of Pontiac,
</p>
<p>which held them to their work. The Indian is

<p>caution for an assault by storm, and too little pa-
</p>
<p>tience for a blockade. The Wyandots and Potta-
</p>
<p>wattamies had shown, from the beginning, less zeal
</p>
<p>than the other nations ; and now, like children
</p>
<p>they began to tire of the task they had undertaken,
</p>
<p>A deputation of the Wyandots came to the fort,
</p>
<p>and begged for peace, which was granted them ;
</p>
<p>but when the Pottawattamies came on the same
</p>
<p>errand, they insisted, as a preliminary, that some
</p>
<p>of their people, who were detained prisoners by
</p>
<p>the English, should first be given up. Gladwyn
</p>
<p>demanded, on his part, that the English captives
</p>
<p>known to be in their village should be' brought to
</p>
<p>the fort, and three of them were accordingly pro-
</p>
<p>duced. As these were but a small part of the
</p>
<p>whole, the deputies were sharply rebuked for their
</p>
<p>duplicity, and told to go back for the rest. They
</p>
<p>withdrew angry and mortified ; but, on the follow-
</p>
<p>ing day, a fresh deputation of chiefs made their
</p>
<p>appearance, bringing with them six prisoners.
</p>
<p>Having repaired to the council-room, they were
</p>
<p>met by Gladwyn, attended only by one or two
</p>
<p>officers. The Indians detained in the fort were
</p>
<p>about to be given up, and a treaty concluded, when
</p>
<p>one of the prisoners declared that there were
</p>
<p>several others still remaining in the Pottawatta-
</p>
<p>mie village. Upon this, the conference w r as broken
</p>
<p>off, and the deputies ordered instantly to depart.

<p>On being thus a second time defeated, they were

<p>goaded to such a pitch of rage, that, as afterwards
</p>
<p>became known, they formed the desperate resolu-

<p>making their escape in the best way they could ;
</p>
<p>but, happily, at that moment the commandant
</p>
<p>observed an Ottawa among them, and, resolving
</p>
<p>to seize him, called upon the guard without to
</p>
<p>assist in doing so. A file of soldiers entered, and

<p>the chiefs, seeing it impossible to execute their

<p>sullen brows. A day or two afterwards, however,

<p>soon reached Presqu' Isle, where they found the
</p>
<p>scorched and battered blockhouse captured a few
</p>
<p>weeks before, and saw with surprise the mines
</p>
<p>and intrenchments made by the Indians in assailing
</p>
<p>it. 1 Thence, proceeding on their voyage, they
</p>
<p>reached Sandusky on the twenty-sixth of July ; an ]
</p>
<p>here they marched inland to the neighboiing vil-
</p>
<p>lage of the Wyandots, which they burnt to the
</p>
<p>ground, at the same time destroying the corn,
</p>
<p>which this tribe, more provident than most of the
</p>
<p>others, had planted there in the spring. Dalzell
</p>
<p>then steered northward for the mouth of the De-
</p>
<p>troit, which he reached on the evening of the
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth, and cautiously ascended under covei
</p>
<p>of night. " It was fortunate," writes Gladwyn,
</p>
<p>" that they were not discovered, in which case
</p>
<p>they must have been destroyed or taken, as the
</p>
<p>Indians, being emboldened by their late successes,
</p>
<p>fight much better than we could have expected."
</p>
<p>On the morning of the twenty-ninth, the whole
</p>
<p>country around Detroit was covered by a sea of
</p>
<p>fog, the precursor of a hot and sultry day ; but at
</p>
<p>sunrise its surface began to heave and toss, and,
</p>
<p>parting at intervals, disclosed the dark and burn-
</p>
<p>ished surface of the river ; then lightly rolling,
</p>
<p>fold upon fold, the mists melted rapidly away,
</p>
<p>the last remnant clinging sluggishly along the
</p>
<p>margin of the forests. Now, for the first time,
</p>
<p>the garrison could discern the approaching con-
</p>
<p>voy. 2 Still they remained in suspense, fearing

<p>lest it might have met the fate of the former
</p>
<p>detachment ; but a salute from the fort was
</p>
<p>answered by a swivel from the boats, and at
</p>
<p>once all apprehension passed away. The convoy
</p>
<p>soon reached a point in the river midway between
</p>
<p>the villages of the Wy an dots and the Pottawatta-
</p>
<p>mies. About a fortnight before, as we have seen,
</p>
<p>these capricious savages had made a treaty of
</p>
<p>peace, which they now saw fit to break, opening a
</p>
<p>hot fire upon the boats from either bank. 1 It was
</p>
<p>answered by swivels and musketry ; but before the
</p>
<p>short engagement was over, fifteen of the English
</p>
<p>were killed or wounded. This danger passed,
</p>
<p>boat after boat came to shore, and landed its men
</p>
<p>amid the cheers of the garrison. The detachment
</p>
<p>was composed of soldiers from the 55th and 80th
</p>
<p>Kegiments, with twenty independent rangers, com-
</p>
<p>manded by Major Rogers ; and as the barracks in
</p>
<p>the place were too small to receive them, they
</p>
<p>were all quartered upon the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Scarcely were these arrangements made, when
</p>
<p>a great smoke was seen rising from the Wyandot
</p>
<p>village across the river, and the inhabitants, appar-
</p>
<p>ently in much consternation, were observed pad-
</p>
<p>dling down stream with their household utensils,
</p>
<p>and even their dogs. It was supposed that they
</p>
<p>had abandoned and burned their huts f but in
</p>
<p>truth, it was only an artifice of these Indians, who
</p>
<p>had set fire to some old canoes and other refuse

<p>returned and lay in ambush among the buohes
</p>
<p>hoping to lure some of the English within reach
</p>
<p>of their guns. None of them, however, fell into
</p>
<p>the snare. 1
</p>
<p>Captain Dalzell was the same officer who was
</p>
<p>the companion of Israel Putnam in some of the
</p>
<p>most adventurous passages of that rough veteran's
</p>
<p>life ; but more recently he had acted as aide-de-
</p>
<p>camp to Sir Jeffrey Amherst. On the day of his
</p>
<p>arrival, he had a conference with Gladwyn, at the
</p>
<p>quarters of the latter, and strongly insisted that the
</p>
<p>time was come when an irrecoverable blow might
</p>
<p>be struck at Pontiac. He requested permission to
</p>
<p>march out on the following night, and attack the
</p>
<p>Indian camp. Gladwyn, better acquainted with
</p>
<p>the position of affairs, and perhaps more cautious
</p>
<p>by nature, was averse to the attempt ; bat Dalzell
</p>
<p>urged his request so strenuously that the command-
</p>
<p>ant yielded to his representations, and gave a tardy
</p>
<p>consent. 2
</p>
<p>Pontiac had recently removed his camp from its
</p>
<p>old position near the mouth of Parent's Creek, and
</p>
<p>was now posted several miles above, behind a great
</p>
<p>marsh, which protected the Indian huts from the

<p>cannon of the vessel. On the afternoon of the
</p>
<p>thirtieth, orders were issned and preparations
</p>
<p>made for the meditated attack. Through the
</p>
<p>inexcusable carelessness of some of the officers,
</p>
<p>the design became known to a few Canadians, the
</p>
<p>bad result of which will appear in the sequel.
</p>
<p>About two o'clock on the morning of the thirty
</p>
<p>first of July, the gates were thrown open in silence,
</p>
<p>and the detachment, two hundred and fifty in num-
</p>
<p>ber, passed noiselessly out. They filed two deep
</p>
<p>along the road, while two large bateaux, each bear-
</p>
<p>ing a swivel on the bow, rowed up the river abreast
</p>
<p>of them. Lieutenant Brown led the advance
</p>
<p>guard of twenty- five men ; the centre was com
</p>
<p>manded by Captain Gray, and the rear by Captain
</p>
<p>Grant. The night was still, close, and sultry, and
</p>
<p>the men marched in light undress. On their right
</p>
<p>was the dark and gleaming surface of the river
</p>
<p>with a margin of sand intervening, and on their left
</p>
<p>a succession of Canadian houses, with barns, or-
</p>
<p>chards, and cornfields, from whence the clamorous
</p>
<p>balking of watch-dogs saluted them as they passed.
</p>
<p>The inhabitants, roused from sleep, looked from
</p>
<p>the windows in astonishment and alarm. An old
</p>
<p>man has told the writer how, when a child, he
</p>
<p>climbed on the roof of his father's house, to look
</p>
<p>down on the glimmering bayonets, and how, long
</p>
<p>after the troops had passed, their heavy and meas-
</p>
<p>ured tramp sounded from afar, through the still
</p>
<p>night. Thus the English moved forward to the
</p>
<p>attack, little thinking that, behind houses and

<p>their progress  little suspecting that Pontiac,
</p>
<p>apprised by the Canadians of their plan, had
</p>
<p>broken up his camp, and was coming against
</p>
<p>them with all his warriors, armed and painted
</p>
<p>for battle.
</p>
<p>A mile and a half from the fort, Parent's Creek,
</p>
<p>ever since that night called Bloody Eun, des( ended
</p>
<p>through a wild and rough hollow, and entered the
</p>
<p>Detroit amid a growth of rank grass and sedge.
</p>
<p>Only a few rods from its mouth, the road crossed
</p>
<p>it by a narrow wooden bridge, not existing at the
</p>
<p>present day. Just beyond this bridge, the land
</p>
<p>rose in abrupt ridges, parallel to the stream. Along
</p>
<p>their summits were rude intrench ments made by
</p>
<p>Pontiac to protect his camp, which had formerly
</p>
<p>occupied the ground immediately beyond. Here,
</p>
<p>too, were many piles of firewood belonging to the
</p>
<p>Canadians, besides strong picket fences, enclosing
</p>
<p>orchards and gardens connected with the neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing houses. Behind fences, wood-piles, and in-
</p>
<p>trenchments, crouched an unknown number of
</p>
<p>Indian warriors with levelled guns. They lay
</p>
<p>silent as snakes, for now they could hear the dis-
</p>
<p>tant tramp of the approaching column.
</p>
<p>The sky was overcast, and the night exceedingly
</p>
<p>dark. As the English drew near the dangerous
</p>
<p>pass, they could discern the oft-mentioned house
</p>
<p>of Meloche upon a rising gruund to the left, while
</p>
<p>in front the bridge was dimly visible, and the ridges
</p>
<p>beyond it seemed like a wall of undistinguished
</p>
<p>blackness. They pushed rapidly forward, not

<p>guard were half way over the bridge, and the
</p>
<p>main body just entering upon it, when a horrible
</p>
<p>burst of yells rose in their front, and the Indian
</p>
<p>guns blazed forth in a general discharge. Half
</p>
<p>the advanced party were shot down ; the appalled
</p>
<p>survivors shrank back aghast. The confusion
</p>
<p>leached even the main body, and the whole re-
</p>
<p>coiled together ; but Dalzell raised his clear voice
</p>
<p>above the din, advanced to the front, rallied the
</p>
<p>men, and led them forward to the attack. 1 Again
</p>
<p>the Indians poured in their volley, and again the
</p>
<p>English hesitated ; but Dalzell shouted from the
</p>
<p>van, and, in the madness of mingled rage and fear,
</p>
<p>they charged at a run across the bridge and up
</p>
<p>the heights beyond. Not an Indian was there to
</p>
<p>oppose them. In vain the furious soldiers sought
</p>
<p>their enemy behind fences and intrenchments. The
</p>
<p>active savages had fled ; yet still their guns flashed
</p>
<p>thick through the gloom, and their war-cry rose
</p>
<p>with undiminished clamor. The English pushed
</p>
<p>forward amid the pitchy darkness, quite ignorant of
</p>
<p>their way, and soon became involved in a maze of
</p>
<p>out-houses and enclosures. At every pause they
</p>
<p>made, the retiring enemy would gather to renew
</p>
<p>the attack, firing back hotly upon the front and
</p>
<p>flanks. To advance farther would be useless, and
</p>
<p>the only alternative was to withdraw and wait
</p>
<p>for daylight. Captain Grant, with his company,
</p>
<p>recrossed the bridge, and took up his station on the
</p>
<p>road. The rest followed, a small party remaining
</p>
<p>to hold the enemy in check while the dead and

</p>
<p>wounded were placed on board the two bateaux
</p>
<p>which had rowed up to the bridge during the action.
</p>
<p>This task was commenced amid a sharp fire from
</p>
<p>both sides ; and before it was completed, heavy
</p>
<p>volleys were heard from the rear, where Captain
</p>
<p>Grant was stationed. A great force of Indians
</p>
<p>had fired upon him from the house of Meloche
</p>
<p>and the neighboring orchards.. ' Grant pushed up
</p>
<p>the hill, and drove them from the orchards at the
</p>
<p>point of the bayonet  drove them, also, from the
</p>
<p>house, and, entering it, found two Canadians within.
</p>
<p>These men told him that the Indians were bent on
</p>
<p>cutting off the English from the fort, and that they
</p>
<p>had gone in great numbers to occupy the houses
</p>
<p>which commanded the road below. 1 It was now
</p>
<p>evident that instant retreat was necessary ; and the
</p>
<p>command being issued to that effect, the men fell
</p>
<p>back into marching order, and slowly began their
</p>
<p>retrograde movement. Grant was now in the van,
</p>
<p>and Dalzell at the rear. Some of the Indians fol-
</p>
<p>lowed, keeping up a scattering and distant fire ;
</p>
<p>and from time to time the rear faced about, to
</p>
<p>throw back a volley of musketry at the pursuers
</p>
<p>Having proceeded in this manner for half a mile,
</p>
<p>they reached a point where, close upon the right,
</p>
<p>were many barns and outhouses, with strong picket
</p>
<p>fences. Behind these, and in a newly dug cellar
</p>
<p>close at hand, lay concealed a great multitude of
</p>
<p>Indians. They suffered the advanced party to pass
</p>
<p>unmolested ; but when the centre and rear came
</p>
<p>opposite their ambuscade, they raised a frightful

<p>yell, and poured a volley among them. The men
</p>
<p>had well-nigh fallen into a panic. The river ran
</p>
<p>close on their left, and the only avenue of escape
</p>
<p>lay along the road in front. Breaking their ranks,
</p>
<p>they crowded upon one another in blind eagerness
</p>
<p>to escape the storm of bullets ; and but for the
</p>
<p>presence of Dalzell, the retreat would have been
</p>
<p>turned into a flight. " The enemy," writes an
</p>
<p>officer who was in the fight, " marked him foi
</p>
<p>his extraordinary bravery ; " and he had already
</p>
<p>received two severe wounds. Yet his exertions
</p>
<p>did not slacken for a moment. Some of the
</p>
<p>soldiers he rebuked, some he threatened, and
</p>
<p>some he beat with the flat of his sword ; till at
</p>
<p>length order was partially restored, and the fire of
</p>
<p>the enemy returned with effect. Though it was near
</p>
<p>daybreak, the dawn was obscured by a thick fog,
</p>
<p>and little could be seen of the Indians, except the
</p>
<p>incessant flashes of their guns amid the mist, while
</p>
<p>hundreds of voices, mingled in one appalling yell,
</p>
<p>confused the faculties of the men, and drowned the
</p>
<p>shout of command. The enemy had taken posses-
</p>
<p>sion of a house, from the windows of which they
</p>
<p>fired down upon the English. Major Rogers, with
</p>
<p>some of his provincial rangers, burst the door with
</p>
<p>an axe, rushed in, and expelled them. Captain
</p>
<p>Gray was ordered to dislodge a large party from
</p>
<p>behind some neighboring fences. He charged
</p>
<p>them with his company, but fell, mortally wounded,
</p>
<p>in the attempt. 1 They gave way, however ; and
</p>
<p>now, the fire of the Indians being much diminished

</p>
<p>the retreat was resumed. No sooner had the men
</p>
<p>faced about, than the savages came darting through
</p>
<p>the mist upon their flank and rear, cutting down
</p>
<p>stragglers, and scalping the fallen. At a little
</p>
<p>distance lay a sergeant of the 55th, helplessly
</p>
<p>wounded, raising himself on his hands, and gaz-
</p>
<p>ing with a look of despair after his retiring com 
</p>
<p>rades. The sight caught the eye of Dalzell. That
</p>
<p>gallant soldier, in the true spirit of heroism, ran
</p>
<p>out, amid the firing, to rescue the wounded man,
</p>
<p>when a shot struck him, and he fell dead. Few
</p>
<p>observed his fate, and none durst turn back to
</p>
<p>recover his body. The detachment pressed on,
</p>
<p>greatly harassed by the pursuing Indians. Their
</p>
<p>loss would have been much more severe, had not
</p>
<p>Major Rogers taken possession of another house,
</p>
<p>which commanded the road, and covered the retreat
</p>
<p>of the party.
</p>
<p>He entered it with some of his own men, while
</p>
<p>many panic-stricken regulars broke in after him, in
</p>
<p>their eagerness to gain a temporary shelter. The
</p>
<p>house was a large and strong one, and the women
</p>
<p>of the neighborhood had crowded into the cellar
</p>
<p>for refuge. While some of the soldiers looked in
</p>
<p>blind terror for a place of concealment, others
</p>
<p>seized upon a keg of whiskey in one of the
</p>
<p>rooms, and quaffed the liquor with eager thirst;
</p>
<p>while others, again, piled packs of furs, furniture t
</p>
<p>and all else within their reach, against the windows,
</p>
<p>to serve as a barricade. Panting and breathless,

<p>their faces moist with sweat and blackened with

<p>gunpowder, they thrust their muskets through
</p>
<p>1763,Jult.1 GRANT CONDUCTS THE RETREAT. 31 s )
</p>
<p>the openings, and fired out upon the whooping
</p>
<p>assailants. At intervals, a bullet flew sharply
</p>
<p>whizzing through a crevice, striking down a man,
</p>
<p>perchance, or rapping harmlessly against the par-
</p>
<p>titions. Old Campau, the master of the house,
</p>
<p>stood on a trap-door to prevent the frightened
</p>
<p>soldiers from seeking shelter among the women
</p>
<p>in the cellar. A ball grazed his gray head, and
</p>
<p>buried itself in the wall, where a few years since
</p>
<p>it might still have been seen. The screams of the
</p>
<p>half-stifled women below, the quavering war-whoops (
</p>
<p>without, the shouts and curses of the soldiers, min-
</p>
<p>gled in a scene of clamorous confusion, and it was
</p>
<p>long before the authority of Rogers could restore
</p>
<p>order. 1
</p>
<p>In the mean time, Captain Grant, with his
</p>
<p>advanced party, had moved forward about half a
</p>
<p>mile, where he found some orchards and enclosures,
</p>
<p>by means of which he could maintain himself until
</p>
<p>the centre and rear should arrive. From this point
</p>
<p>he detached all the men he could spare to occupy
</p>
<p>the houses below ; and as soldiers soon began to
</p>
<p>come in from the rear, he was enabled to re-en-
</p>
<p>force these detachments, until a complete line of
</p>
<p>communication was established with the fort, and
</p>
<p>the retreat effectually secured. Within an hour,
</p>
<p>the whole party had arrived, with the exception of
</p>
<p>Rogers and his men, who were quite unable to

<p>come off, being besieged in the house of Campau,

<p>by full two hundred Indians. The two armed
</p>
<p>bateaux had gone down to the fort, laden with the
</p>
<p>dead and wounded. They now returned, and, in
</p>
<p>obedience to an order from Grant, proceeded up
</p>
<p>the river to a point opposite Campau's house, where
</p>
<p>they opened a fire of swivels, which swept the
</p>
<p>ground above and below it, and completely scat-
</p>
<p>tered the assailants. Rogers and his party now
</p>
<p>came out, and marched down the road, to unite
</p>
<p>themselves with Grant. The two bateaux accom-
</p>
<p>panied them closely, and, by a constant fire, re-
</p>
<p>strained the Indians from making an attack.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had Rogers left the house at one door,
</p>
<p>w r hen the enemy entered it at another, to obtain the
</p>
<p>scalps from two or three corpses left behind. Fore-
</p>

<p>with a shrill scream, and, slashing open one of the

<p>dead bodies with her knife, scooped up the blood

<p>\ ecstasy.

</p>
<p>and yelling, at a vain distance, unable to make an
</p>
<p>attack, so well did Grant choose his positions, and

<p>so steadily and coolly conduct the retreat. About

<p>could not be ascertained, but it certainly did not
</p>
<p>exceed fifteen or twenty. At the beginning of the
</p>
<p>fight, their numbers were probably much inferior
</p>
<p>to those of the English ; but fresh parties were
</p>
<p>continually joining them, until seven or eight hun-

<p>dred warriors must have been present.

<p>The ' Ojibwas and Ottawas alone formed the

<p>later to the scene of action, crossing the river in
</p>
<p>their canoes, or passing round through the woods
</p>
<p>behind the fort, to take part in the fray. 1
</p>
<p>In speaking of the fight of Bloody Bridge, an
</p>
<p>able writer in the Annual Register for the year
</p>
<p>1763 observes, with justice, that although in Euro-
</p>
<p>pean warfare it would be deemed a mere skirmish,
</p>
<p>yet in a conflict with the American savages, it rises
</p>
<p>to the importance of a pitched battle ; since these
</p>
<p>people, being thinly s mattered over a great extent of
</p>
<p>country, are accustomed to conduct their warfare
</p>
<p>by detail, and never take the field in any great
</p>
<p>force.
</p>
<p>The Indians were greatly elated by their success.

<p>Runners were sent out for several hundred miles,

<p>through the surrounding woods, to spread tidings

<p>31W THE FIGHT OF BLOODY BRIDGE. (176&, Sep,
</p>
<p>of the victory ; and re-enforcements soon began to
</p>
<p>come in to swell the force of Pontiac. " Fresh
</p>
<p>warriors," writes Gladwyn, " arrive almost every
</p>
<p>day, and I believe that I shall soon be besieged by
</p>
<p>upwards of a thousand." The English, on their
</p>
<p>part, were well prepared for resistance, since the
</p>
<p>garrison now comprised more than three hundred
</p>
<p>effective men ; and no one entertained a doubt of
</p>
<p>their ultimate success in defending the place.
</p>
<p>Day after day passed on ; a few skirmishes took
</p>
<p>place, and a few men were killed, but nothing
</p>
<p>worthy of notice occurred, until the night of the
</p>
<p>fourth of September, at which time was achieved
</p>
<p>one of the most memorable feats which the chroni-
</p>
<p>cles of that day can boast.
</p>
<p>The schooner Gladwyn, the smaller of the two
</p>
<p>armed vessels so often mentioned, had been sent
</p>
<p>down to Niagara with letters and despatches. She
</p>
<p>was now returning, having on board Horst, her
</p>
<p>master, Jacobs, her mate, and a crew of ten men,
</p>
<p>all of whom were provincials, besides six Iroquois
</p>
<p>Indians, supposed to be friendly to the English.
</p>
<p>On the night of the third, she entered the River
</p>
<p>Detroit ; and in the morning the six Indians asked
</p>
<p>to be set on shore, a request which was foolishly
</p>
<p>granted. They disappeared in the woods, and
</p>
<p>probably reported to Pontiac's warriors the small
</p>
<p>numbers of the crew. The vessel stood up the
</p>
<p>river until nightfall, when, the wind failing, she
</p>
<p>was compelled to anchor about nine miles below
</p>
<p>the fort. The men on board watched with anxious

<p>every sound which broke the stillness, from the
</p>
<p>strange cry of the nighthawk, wheeling above their
</p>
<p>heads, to the bark of the fox from the woods on
</p>
<p>shore. The night set in with darkness so com-
</p>
<p>plete, that at the distance of a few rods nothing
</p>
<p>conld be discerned. Meantime, three hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty Indians, in their birch canoes, glided silently
</p>
<p>down with the current, and were close upon the
</p>
<p>vessel before they were seen. There was only time
</p>
<p>to fire a single cannon-shot among them, before
</p>
<p>they were beneath her bows, and clambering up
</p>
<p>her sides, holding their knives clinched fast be
</p>
<p>tween their teeth. The crew gave them a close
</p>
<p>fire of musketry, without any effect ; then, flinging
</p>
<p>down their guns, they seized the spears and hatchets
</p>
<p>with which they w 7 ere all provided, and met the
</p>
<p>assailants with such furious energy and courage,
</p>
<p>that in the space of two or three minutes they had
</p>
<p>killed and wounded more than twice their own
</p>
<p>number. But the Indians were only checked for a
</p>
<p>moment. The master of the vessel was killed,
</p>
<p>several of the crew were disabled, and the assail-
</p>
<p>ants were leaping over the bulwarks, when Jacobs,
</p>
<p>the mate, called out to blow up the schooner. This
</p>
<p>desperate command saved her and her crew. Some
</p>
<p>Wyandots, who had gained the deck, caught the
</p>
<p>meaning of his words, and gave the alarm to their
</p>
<p>companions. Instantly every Indian leaped over-
</p>
<p>board in a panic, and the whole were seen diving
</p>
<p>and swimming off in all directions, to escape the
</p>
<p>threatened explosion. The schooner was cleared

<p>for the fort, which she reached without molesta-

</p>
<p>remainder, two were killed, and four seriously

<p>upon the spot, and nearly twenty wounded, of
</p>
<p>whom eight were known to have died within a
</p>
<p>few days after. As the action was very brief, the
</p>
<p>fierceness of the struggle is sufficiently apparent
</p>
<p>from the loss on both sides. " The appearance of
</p>
<p>the men," says an eye-witness who saw them on
</p>
<p>their arrival, u was enough to convince every one
</p>
<p>jf their bravery ; they being as bloody as butchers,
</p>
<p>and their bayonets, spears, and cutlasses, blood to

<p>the hilt." The survivors of the crew were after-
</p>
<p>wards rewarded as their courage deserved. 1

<p>CHAPTER XVI.

<p>1763
</p>
<p>U ICHILLI MACKINAC
</p>
<p>In the spring of the year 1763, before the wai
</p>
<p>broke out, several English traders went up to
</p>
<p>Michillimackinac, some adopting the old route of
</p>
<p>the Ottawa, and others that of Detroit and the
</p>
<p>lakes. We will follow one of the latter on his
</p>
<p>adventurous progress. Passing the fort and settle-
</p>
<p>ment of Detroit, he soon enters Lake St. Clair,
</p>
<p>which seems like a broad basin filled to overflow
</p>
<p>ing, while, along its far distant verge, a faint line
</p>
<p>of forest separates the water from the sky. He
</p>
<p>crosses the lake, and his voyageurs next urge his
</p>
<p>canoe against the current of the great river above.
</p>
<p>At length, Lake Huron opens before him, stretch-
</p>
<p>ing its liquid expanse, like an ocean, to the farthest
</p>
<p>horizon. His canoe skirts the eastern shore of
</p>
<p>Michigan, where the forest rises like a wall fi m
</p>
<p>the water's edge ; and as he advances northward,
</p>
<p>an endless lin^ of stiff and shaggy fir-trees, hung
</p>
<p>with long mosses, fringes the shore with an aspect
</p>
<p>of monotonous desolation. In the space of two or
</p>
<p>three weeks if his Canadians labor well, and no

</p>
<p>his voyage. Passing on his right the extensive
</p>
<p>Island of Bois Blanc, he sees, nearly in front, the
</p>
<p>beautiful Mackinaw, rising, with its white cliffs
</p>
<p>and green foliage, from the broad breast of the
</p>
<p>waters. He does not steer towards it, for at that
</p>
<p>day the Indians were its only tenants, but keeps
</p>
<p>along the main shore to the left, while his voy-
</p>
<p>ageurs raise their song and chorus. Doubling a
</p>
<p>point, he sees before him the red flag of England
</p>
<p>swelling lazily in the wind, and the palisades and
</p>
<p>wooden bastions of Fort Michillimackinac standing
</p>
<p>close upon the margin of the lake. On the beach,
</p>
<p>canoes are drawn up, and Canadians and Indians
</p>
<p>are idly lounging. A little beyond the fort is a
</p>
<p>cluster of the white Canadian houses, roofed with
</p>
<p>bark, and protected by fences of strong round
</p>
<p>pickets.
</p>
<p>The trader enters at the gate, and sees before
</p>
<p>him an extensive square area, surrounded by high
</p>
<p>palisades. Numerous houses, barracks, and other
</p>
<p>buildings, form a smaller square within, and in the
</p>
<p>vacant space which they enclose appear the red
</p>
<p>uniforms of British soldiers, the gray coats of
</p>
<p>Canadians, and the gaudy Indian blankets, mingled
</p>
<p>in picturesque confusion ; while a multitude of
</p>
<p>squaws, with children of every hue, stroll restlessly
</p>
<p>aoout the place. Such was Fort Michillimackinac
</p>
<p>in 1763. 1 Its name, which, in the Algonquin
</p>
<p>tongue, signifies the Great Turtle, was first, from

</p>
<p>a fancied resemblance, applied to trie neighboring
</p>
<p>island, and thence to the fort.
</p>
<p>Though buried in a wilderness, Michillimackinac
</p>
<p>was still of no recent origin. As early as 1671, the
</p>
<p>Jesuits had established a mission near the place,
</p>
<p>and a military force was not long in following : for
</p>
<p>under -the French dominion, the priest and the
</p>
<p>soldier went hand in hand. Neither toil, nor suf
</p>
<p>fering, nor all the terrors of the wilderness, sould
</p>
<p>damp the zeal of the undaunted missionary ; and
</p>
<p>the restless ambition of France was always on the
</p>
<p>alert to seize every point of vantage, and avail
</p>
<p>itself of every means to gain ascendency over the
</p>
<p>forest tribes. Besides Michillimackinac, there were
</p>
<p>two other posts in this northern region, Green Bay,
</p>
<p>and the Sault Ste. Marie. Both were founded at
</p>
<p>an early period, and both presented the same char-
</p>
<p>acteristic features  a mission-house, a fort, and a
</p>
<p>cluster of Canadian dwellings. They had been
</p>
<p>originally garrisoned by small parties of militia,
</p>
<p>who, bringing their families with them, settled on
</p>
<p>the spot, and were founders of these little colonies,
</p>
<p>Michillimackinac, much the largest of the three,
</p>
<p>contained thirty families within the palisades of
</p>
<p>the fort, and about as many more without. Be-
</p>
<p>sides its military value, it was important as a centre
</p>
<p>of the fur-trade ; for it was here that the traders
</p>
<p>engaged their men, and sent out their goods in
</p>
<p>canoes, under the charge of subordinates, to the
</p>
<p>more distant regions of the Mississippi and the
</p>
<p>North- west.

</p>
<p>and the settlers were completely isolated  cut off
</p>
<p>from all connection with the world ; and, indeed,
</p>
<p>so great was the distance, and so serious the perils,
</p>
<p>which separated the three sister posts of the north-
</p>
<p>ern hikes, that often, through the whole winter, all
</p>
<p>intercourse was stopped between them. 1
</p>
<p>It is difficult for the imagination adequately to
</p>
<p>conceive the extent of these fresh-water oceans,
</p>
<p>and vast regions of forest, which, at the date of
</p>
<p>our narrative, were the domain of nature, a mighty
</p>
<p>hunting and fishing ground, for the sustenance of a
</p>
<p>few wandering tribes. One might journey among
</p>
<p>them for days, and even weeks together, without
</p>
<p>beholding a human face. The Indians near Mich-
</p>
<p>illimackinac were the Ojibwas and Ottawas, the
</p>
<p>former of whom claimed the eastern section of
</p>
<p>Michigan, and the latter the western, their respec-
</p>
<p>tive portions being separated by a line drawn
</p>
<p>southward from the fort itself. 2 The principal
</p>
<p>village of the Ojibwas contained about a hundred
</p>
<p>warriors, and stood upon the Island of Michilli-
</p>
<p>mackinac, now called Mackinaw. There was
</p>
<p>another smaller village near the head of Thunder
</p>
<p>Bay. The Ottawas, to the number of two hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty warriors, lived at the settlement of
</p>
<p>L'Arbre Croche, on the shores of Lake Michigan,
</p>
<p>some distance west of the fort. This place was
</p>
<p>then the seat of the old Jesuit mission of St. Ig-
</p>
<p>nace, originally placed, by Father Marquette, on the
</p>
<p>northern side of the straits. Many of the Ottawas

<p>were nominal Catholics. They were all somewhat
</p>
<p>improved from their original savage condition, liv-
</p>
<p>ing in log houses, and cultivating corn and vegeta-
</p>
<p>bles to such an extent as to supply the fort with
</p>
<p>provisions, besides satisfying their own wants.
</p>
<p>The Ojibwas, on the other hand, were not in the
</p>
<p>least degree removed from their primitive barbar
</p>
<p>ism. 1
</p>
<p>These two tribes, with most of the other neigh
</p>
<p>boring Indians, were strongly hostile to the English.
</p>
<p>Many of their warriors had fought against them in
</p>
<p>the late war, for France had summoned allies from
</p>
<p>the farthest corners of the wilderness, to aid her in
</p>
<p>her struggle. This feeling of hostility was excited
</p>
<p>to a higher pitch by the influence of the Canadians,
</p>
<p>who disliked the English, not merely as national
</p>
<p>enemies, but also as rivals in the fur-trade, and
</p>
<p>were extremely jealous of their intrusion upon the
</p>
<p>lakes. The following incidents, which occurred in
</p>
<p>the autumn cf the year 1761, will illustrate the
</p>
<p>state of feeling which prevailed : 
</p>
<p>At that time, although Michillimackinac had been
</p>
<p>surrendered, and the French garrison removed, no
</p>
<p>English troops had yet arrived to supply their place,
</p>
<p>and the Canadians were the only tenants of the fort.
</p>
<p>An adventurous trader, Alexander Henry, who,
</p>
<p>with one or two others, was the pioneer of the
</p>

<p>and assured or death if tie proceeded , and, at
</p>
<p>length, was compelled for safety to assume the dis
</p>
<p>guise of a Canadian voyageur. When his canoes,
</p>
<p>laden with goods, reached the fort, he was very
</p>
<p>coldly received by its inhabitants, who did all in
</p>
<p>their power to alarm and discourage him. Soon
</p>
<p>after his arrival; he received the very unwelcome
</p>
<p>information, that a large number of Ojibwas, from
</p>
<p>the neighboring villages, were coining, in their
</p>
<p>canoes, to call upon him. Under ordinary cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, such a visitation, though disagreeable
</p>
<p>enough, would excite neither anxiety nor surprise ;
</p>
<p>for the Indians, when in their villages, lead so mo-
</p>
<p>notonous an existence, that they are ready to snatch
</p>
<p>at the least occasion of excitement, and the pros
</p>
<p>pect of a few trifling presents, and a few pipes of
</p>
<p>tobacco, is often a sufficient inducement for a jour-
</p>
<p>ney of several days. But in the present instance
</p>
<p>there was serious cause of apprehension, since
</p>
<p>Canadians and Frenchmen were alike hostile to the
</p>
<p>solitary trader. The story could not be better told
</p>
<p>than in his own words.
</p>
<p>" At two o'clock in the afternoon, the Chippewas
</p>
<p>(Ojibwas) came to the house, about sixty in num
</p>
<p>ber, and headed by Minavavana, their chief. They
</p>
<p>walked in single file, each with his tomahawk in
</p>
<p>one hand and scalping-knife in the other. Their
</p>
<p>bodies were naked from the waist upward, except
</p>
<p>in a few examples, where blankets were thrown
</p>
<p>loosely over the shoulders. Their faces were
</p>
<p>painted with charcoal, worked up with grease, their

<p>noses, and their heads decorated with the" same.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell on the sensations with
</p>
<p>which I beheld the approach of this uncouth, if
</p>
<p>not frightful assemblage.
</p>
<p>' : The chief entered first, and the rest followed
</p>
<p>without noise. On receiving a sign from the for
</p>
<p>mer, the latter seated themselves on the floor.
</p>
<p>" Minavavana appeared to be about fifty years
</p>
<p>of age. He was six feet in height, and had in his
</p>
<p>countenance an indescribable mixture of good and
</p>
<p>evil. Looking steadfastly at me, where I sat in
</p>
<p>ceremony, with an interpreter on either hand, and
</p>
<p>several Canadians behind me, he entered, at the
</p>
<p>same time, into conversation with Campion, inquir-
</p>
<p>ing how long it was since I left Montreal, and ob
</p>
<p>serving that the English, as it would seem, were
</p>
<p>brave men, and not afraid of death, since they
</p>
<p>dared to come, as I had done, fearlessly among
</p>
<p>their enemies.
</p>
<p>" The Indians now gravely smoked their pipes,
</p>
<p>while I inwardly endured the tortures of suspense.
</p>
<p>At length, the pipes being finished, as well as a
</p>
<p>long pause, by which they were succeeded, Mina-
</p>
<p>vavana, taking a few strings of wampum in his
</p>
<p>hand, began the following speech: 
</p>
<p>" ' Englishman, it is to you that I speak, and I
</p>
<p>demand your attention.

<p>" ' Englishman, it is you that have made war

<p>among us, his children 1 You know that his ne

</p>
<p>" c Englishman, we are informed that our father
</p>
<p>the King of France, is old and infirm ; and that,
</p>
<p>being fatigued with making war upon your nation
</p>
<p>he is fallen asleep. During his sleep you have
</p>
<p>taken advantage of him, and possessed yourselves
</p>
<p>of Canada. But his nap is almost at an end. I
</p>
<p>think I hear him already stirring, and inquiring
</p>
<p>for his children, the Indians ; and when he does
</p>
<p>awake, what must become of you? He will de-
</p>
<p>stroy you utterly.

<p>the French, you have not yet conquered us. We
</p>
<p>are not your slaves. These lakes, these woods and

<p>are our inheritance ; and we will part with them

</p>
<p>of two ways ; the first is by the spilling of the
</p>
<p>blood of the nation by which they fell ; the other,
</p>
<p>by covering the bodies of the dead, and thus allay-
</p>
<p>ing the resentment of their relations. This is done
</p>
<p>by making presents.
</p>
<p>" c Englishman, your king has never sent us any
</p>
<p>presents, nor entered into any treaty with us ;
</p>
<p>wherefore he and we are still at war ; and, until
</p>
<p>he does these things, we must consider that we
</p>
<p>have no other father nor friend, among the white
</p>
<p>nen, than the King of France ; but for you, we
</p>
<p>have taken into consideration that you have ven-
</p>
<p>tured your life among us, in the expectation that
</p>
<p>we should not molest you. You do not come
</p>
<p>armed, with an intention to make war ; you come
</p>
<p>in peace, to trade with us, and supply us with
</p>
<p>necessaries, of which we are in much want. We
</p>
<p>shall regard you, therefore, as a brother ; and
</p>
<p>you may sleep tranquilly, without fear of the Chip-
</p>
<p>"^pewas. As a token of our friendship, we present
</p>
<p>you this pipe to smoke.'
</p>
<p>fct As Minavavana uttered these words, an Indian
</p>
<p>presented me with a pipe, which, after I had drawn
</p>
<p>the smoke three times, was carried to the chief,
</p>
<p>and after him to every person in the room. This
</p>
<p>ceremony ended, the chief arose, and gave me his
</p>
<p>hand, in which he was followed by all the rest." '
</p>
<p>These tokens of friendship were suitably ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged by the trader, who made a formal

<p>reply to Minavavana's speech. To this succeeded

<p>1761-1 RESOLUTION* OF THE TIIKEE TRADERS. 33 1
</p>
<p>with which Henry unwillingly complied ; and, hav
</p>
<p>ing distributed several small additional presents, he
</p>
<p>beheld, with profound satisfaction, the departure
</p>
<p>of his guests. Scarcely had he ceased to congratu-
</p>
<p>late himself on having thus got rid of the Ojibwas,
</p>
<p>or, as he calls them, the Chippewas, when a more
</p>
<p>fo] midable invasion once more menaced him with
</p>
<p>destruction. Two hundred L'Arbre Croche Otta-
</p>
<p>was came in a body to the fort, and summoned
</p>
<p>Henry, together with Goddard and Solomons, two
</p>
<p>other traders, who had just arrived, to meet them
</p>
<p>in council. Here they informed their startled
</p>
<p>auditors that they must distribute their goods
</p>
<p>among the Indians, adding a worthless promise to
</p>
<p>pay them in the spring, and threatening force in
</p>
<p>case of a refusal. Being allowed until the next
</p>
<p>morning to reflect on what they had heard, the
</p>
<p>traders resolved on resistance, and, accordingly,
</p>
<p>arming about thirty of their men with muskets,
</p>
<p>they barricaded themselves in the house occupied
</p>
<p>by Henry, and kept strict watch all night. The
</p>
<p>Ottawas, however, did not venture an attack. On
</p>
<p>the following day, the Canadians, with pretended
</p>
<p>sympathy, strongly advised compliance with the de-
</p>
<p>mand ; but the three traders resolutely held out, and
</p>
<p>kept possession of their stronghold till night, when,
</p>
<p>to their surprise and joy, the news arrived that the
</p>
<p>body of troops known to be on their way towards the
</p>
<p>fort were, at that moment, encamped within a few
</p>
<p>miles of it. Another night of watching and anxiety
</p>
<p>succeeded ; but at sunrise, the Ottawas launched

</p>
<p>their canoes and departed, while, immediately after
</p>
<p>832 MICH1LLIMACKINA0. [176a
</p>
<p>the boats of the English detachment were seen
</p>
<p>to approach the landing-place. Michillimackinac
</p>
<p>received a strong garrison ; and for a time, at least,
</p>
<p>the traders were safe.
</p>
<p>Time passed on, and the hostile feelings of the
</p>
<p>Indians towards the English did not diminish. It
</p>
<p>necessarily follows, from the extremely loose char-
</p>
<p>acter of Indian government,  if indeed the name
</p>
<p>government be applicable at all,  that the sepa-
</p>
<p>rate members of the same tribe have little political
</p>
<p>connection, and are often united merely by, the
</p>
<p>social tie of totemship. Thus the Ottawas at
</p>
<p>L'Arbre Croche were quite independent of those
</p>
<p>at Detroit. They had a chief of their own, who by
</p>
<p>no means acknowledged the authority of Pontiac,
</p>
<p>though the high reputation of this great warrior
</p>
<p>everywhere attached respect and influence to his
</p>
<p>name. The same relations subsisted between the
</p>
<p>Ojibwas of Michillimackinac and their more south-
</p>
<p>ern tribesmen ; and the latter might declare war
</p>
<p>and make peace without at all involving the former.
</p>
<p>The name of the Ottawa chief at L'Arbre Croche
</p>
<p>has not survived in history or tradition. The chief
</p>
<p>of the Ojibwas, however, is still remembered by the
</p>
<p>remnants of his people, and was the same whom
</p>
<p>Henry calls Minavavana, or, as the Canadians
</p>
<p>entitled him, by way of distinction, Le Grand
</p>
<p>Sauteur, or the Great Ojibwa. He lived in the
</p>
<p>little village of Thunder Bay, though his power
</p>
<p>was acknowledged by the Indians of the neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing islands. That his mind was of no common

</p>
<p>order is sufficiently evinced by his speech to Henry;
</p>
<p>1763.| PONTIAC INVITES AID. 333
</p>
<p>but he had not the commanding spirit of Pontiac.
</p>
<p>His influence seems not to have extended beyond
</p>
<p>his own tribe. He could not, or at least he did not,
</p>
<p>control the erratic forces of an Indian community,
</p>
<p>and turn them into one broad current of steady and
</p>
<p>united energy. Hence, in the events about to be
</p>
<p>described, the natural instability of the Indian
</p>
<p>character was abundantly displayed.
</p>
<p>In the spring of the year 1763, Pontiac, in com-
</p>
<p>passing his grand scheme of hostility, sent, among
</p>
<p>the rest, to the Indians of Michillimackinac, invit-
</p>
<p>ing them to aid him in the war. His messengers,
</p>
<p>bearing in their hands the war-belt of black and
</p>
<p>purple wampum, appeared before the assembled
</p>
<p>warriors, flung at their feet a hatchet painted red,
</p>
<p>and delivered the speech with which they had been
</p>
<p>charged. The warlike auditory answered with
</p>
<p>ejaculations of applause, and, taking up the blood-
</p>
<p>red hatchet, pledged themselves to join in the con-
</p>
<p>test. Before the end of May, news reached the
</p>
<p>Ojibwas that Pontiac had already struck the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish at Detroit. This wrought them up to a high,
</p>
<p>pitch of excitement and emulation, and they
</p>
<p>resolved that peace should last no longer. Their
</p>
<p>numbers were at this time more than doubled by
</p>
<p>several bands of their wandering people, who had
</p>
<p>gathered at Michillimackinac from far and near,
</p>
<p>attracted probably by rumors of impending war.
</p>
<p>Being, perhaps, jealous of the Ottawas, or willing
</p>
<p>to gain all the glory and plunder to themselves,
</p>
<p>they determined to attack the fort, without com-
</p>
<p>municating the design to their neighbors of L'Arbre

</p>
<p>334 MICHILLIMACKINAC. (1763.
</p>
<p>At this time there were about thirty-five men,
</p>
<p>with their officers, in garrison at Michillimackinac. 1
</p>
<p>Warning of the tempest that impended had been
</p>
<p>clearly given ; enough, had it been heeded, to have
</p>
<p>averted the fatal disaster. Several of the Cana-
</p>
<p>dians least hostile to the English had thrown out
</p>
<p>hints of approaching danger, and one of them had
</p>
<p>even told Captain Etherington, the commandant,
</p>
<p>that the Indians had formed a design to destroy, not
</p>
<p>only his garrison, but all the English on the lakes.
</p>
<p>With a folly, of which, at this period, there were
</p>
<p>several parallel instances among the British officers
</p>
<p>in America, Etherington not only turned a deaf ear
</p>
<p>to what he heard, but threatened to send prisoner
</p>
<p>to Detroit the next person who should disturb the
</p>
<p>fort with such tidings. . Henry, the trader, who
</p>
<p>was at this time in the place, had also seen occa-
</p>
<p>sion to distrust the Indians ; but on communicat-
</p>
<p>ing his suspicions to the commandant, the latter
</p>
<p>treated them with total disregard. Henry accuses
</p>
<p>himself of sharing this officer's infatuation. That
</p>
<p>his person was in danger, had been plainly inti-
</p>
<p>mated to him, under the following curious circum-
</p>
<p>stances : 
</p>
<p>An Ojibwa chief, named Wawatam, had con-
</p>
<p>ceived for him one of those friendly attachments
</p>
<p>which often form so pleasing a feature in the In-
</p>
<p>dian character. It was about a year since Henry
</p>
<p>had first met with this man. One morning, Wa-
</p>
<p>1 This appears from the letters of Captain Etherington. Henry states
</p>
<p>the number at ninety. It is not unlikely that he meant to include all the

</p>
<p>watam had entered his house, and placing before
</p>
<p>him, on the ground, a large present of furs and
</p>
<p>dried meat, delivered a speech to the following
</p>
<p>effect: Early in life, he said, he had withdrawn,
</p>
<p>after the ancient usage of his people, to fast and
</p>
<p>pray in solitude, that he might propitiate the Great
</p>
<p>Spirit, and learn the future career marked out for
</p>
<p>him. In the course of his dreams and visions on
</p>
<p>this occasion, it was revealed to him that, in after
</p>
<p>years, he should meet a white man, who should be
</p>
<p>to him a friend and brother. No sooner had he
</p>
<p>seen Henry, than the irrepressible conviction rose
</p>
<p>up within him, that he was the man whom the
</p>
<p>Great Spirit had indicated, and that the dream was
</p>
<p>now fulfilled. Henry replied to the speech with
</p>
<p>suitable acknowledgments of gratitude, made a
</p>
<p>present in his turn, smoked a pipe with Wa watam,
</p>
<p>and, as the latter soon after left the fort, speedily
</p>
<p>forgot his Indian friend and brother altogether.
</p>
<p>Many months had elapsed since the occurrence of
</p>
<p>this very characteristic incident, when, on the
</p>
<p>second of June, Henry's door was pushed open
</p>
<p>without ceremony, and the dark figure of Wawa-
</p>
<p>tam glided silently in. He said that he was just
</p>
<p>returned from his wintering ground. Henry, at
</p>
<p>length recollecting him, inquired after the success
</p>
<p>of his hunt ; but the Indian, without replying, sa*
</p>
<p>down with a dejected air, and expressed his sur-
</p>
<p>prise and regret at finding his brother still in the
</p>
<p>fort. He said that he was going on the next day
</p>
<p>to the Sault Ste. Marie, and that he wished Henry

</p>
<p>to go with him. He then asked if the English had
</p>
<p>336 MICHILLIMACKINAC [1763, June
</p>
<p>heard no bad news, and said that through the
</p>
<p>winter he himself had been much disturbed by the
</p>
<p>singing of evil birds. Seeing that Henry gave
</p>
<p>little attention to what he said, he at length went
</p>
<p>away with a sad and mournful face. On the next
</p>
<p>morning he came again, together with his squaw,
</p>
<p>and, offering the trader a present of dried meat,
</p>
<p>again pressed him to go with him, in the afternoon,
</p>
<p>to the Sault Ste. Marie. When Henry demanded
</p>
<p>his reason for such urgency, he asked if his brother
</p>
<p>did not know that many bad Indians, who had
</p>
<p>never shown themselves at the fort, were encamped
</p>
<p>in the woods around it. To-morrow, he said, they
</p>
<p>are coming to ask for whiskey, and would all get
</p>
<p>drunk, so that it would be dangerous to remain.
</p>
<p>Wawatam let fall, in addition, various other hints,
</p>
<p>which, but for Henry's imperfect knowledge of the
</p>
<p>Algonquin language, could hardly have failed to
</p>
<p>draw his attention. As it was, however, his friend's
</p>
<p>words were spoken in vain ; and at length, after
</p>
<p>long and persevering efforts, he and his squaw
</p>
<p>took their departure, but not, as Henry declares,
</p>
<p>before each had let fall some tears. Among the
</p>
<p>Indian women, the practice of weeping and wailing
</p>
<p>is universal upon all occasions of sorrowful emo-
</p>
<p>tion ; and the kind-hearted squaw, as she took
</p>
<p>down her husband's lodge, and loaded his canoe
</p>
<p>for departure, did not cease to sob and moan aloud.
</p>
<p>On this same afternoon, Henry remembers that
</p>
<p>the fort was full of Indians, moving about among
</p>
<p>the soldiers with a great appearance of friendship.

<p>Many of them came to his house, to purchase

<p>knives and small hatchets, often asking to see silver

</p>
<p>as afterwards appeared, of learning their places of
</p>
<p>deposit, in order the more easily to lay hand on
</p>
<p>them at the moment of pillage. As the afternoon

<p>drew to a close, the visitors quietly went away ;

<p>CHAPTER XVn.
</p>
<p>1763.
</p>
<p>THE MASSACRE.
</p>
<p>The following morning was warm and sultry. It
</p>
<p>was the fourth of June, the birthday of King
</p>
<p>George. The discipline of the garrison was re-
</p>
<p>laxed, and some license allowed to the soldiers. 1
</p>
<p>Encamped in the woods, not far off, were a large
</p>
<p>number of Ojibwas, lately arrived ; while several
</p>
<p>bands of the Sac Indians, from the River Wiscon-
</p>
<p>sin, had also erected their lodges in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>Early in the morning, many Ojibwas came to the
</p>
<p>fort, inviting officers and soldiers to come out and
</p>
<p>see a grand game of ball, which was to be played
</p>
<p>between their nation and the Sacs. In consequence,
</p>
<p>the place was soon deserted by half its tenants.
</p>
<p>An outline of Michillimackinac, as far as tradition
</p>
<p>has preserved its general features, has already been
</p>
<p>given ; and it is easy to conceive, with sufficient
</p>
<p>accuracy, the appearance it must have preserted
</p>
<p>on this eventful morning. The houses and bar-
</p>
<p>racks were so ranged as to form a quadrangle, en-
</p>
<p>closing an extensive area, upon which their doors

</p>
<p>all opened, while behind rose the tall palisades,
</p>
<p>forming a large external square. The picturesque
</p>
<p>Canadian houses, with their rude porticoes, and
</p>
<p>projecting roofs of bark, sufficiently indicated the
</p>
<p>occupations of their inhabitants ; for birch canoes
</p>
<p>were lying near many of them, and fishing-nets
</p>
<p>vere stretched to dry in the sun. Women and
</p>
<p>children were moving about the doors ; knots of
</p>
<p>Canadian voyageurs reclined on the ground, smok-
</p>
<p>ing and conversing ; soldiers were lounging list
</p>
<p>lessly at the doors and windows of the barracks,
</p>
<p>or strolling in careless undress about the area.
</p>
<p>Without the fort the scene was of a vevy differ-
</p>
<p>ent character. The gates were wide open, and
</p>
<p>soldiers were collected in groups under the shadow
</p>
<p>of the palisades, watching the Indian ball play.
</p>
<p>Most of them were without arms, and mingled
</p>
<p>among them were a great number of Canadians,
</p>
<p>while a multitude of Indian squaws, wrapped in
</p>
<p>blankets, were conspicuous in the crowd.
</p>
<p>Captain Etherington and Lieutenant Leslie stood
</p>
<p>near the gate, the former indulging his inveterate
</p>
<p>English propensity ; for, as Henry informs us, he
</p>
<p>had promised the Ojibwas that he would bet on
</p>
<p>their side against the Sacs. Indian chiefs and war-
</p>
<p>riors were also among the spectators, intent, appar-
</p>
<p>ently, on watching the game, but with thoughts,
</p>
<p>in fact, far otherwise employed.
</p>
<p>The plain in front was covered by the ball
</p>
<p>players. The game in which they were engaged,
</p>
<p>called baggattaway by the Ojibwas, is still, as it

</p>
<p>tribes. At either extremity of the ground, a tall
</p>
<p>post was planted, marking the stations of the rival
</p>
<p>parties. The object of each was to defend its own
</p>
<p>post, and drive the ball to that of its adversary.
</p>
<p>Hundreds of lithe and agile figures were leaping
</p>
<p>and bounding upon the plain. Each was nearly
</p>
<p>naked, his loose black hair flying in the wind, and
</p>
<p>each bore in his hand a bat of a form peculiar to
</p>
<p>this game. At one moment the whole were crowded
</p>
<p>together, a dense throng of combatants, all strug-
</p>
<p>gling for the ball ; at the next, they were scattered
</p>
<p>again, and running over the ground like hounds
</p>
<p>in full cry. Each, in his excitement, yelled and
</p>
<p>shouted at the height of his voice. Rushing and
</p>
<p>striking, tripping their adversaries, or hurling them
</p>
<p>to the ground, they pursued the animating contest
</p>
<p>amid the laughter and applause of the spectators.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the midst of the multitude, the ball
</p>
<p>soared into the air, and, descending in a wide
</p>
<p>curve, fell near the pickets of the fort. This was
</p>
<p>no chance stroke. It was part of a preconcerted
</p>
<p>stratagem to insure the surprise and destruction of
</p>
<p>the garrison. As if in pursuit of the ball, the
</p>
<p>players turned and came rushing, a maddened and
</p>
<p>tumultuous throng, towards the gate. In a moment
</p>
<p>they had reached it. The amazed English had no
</p>
<p>time to think or act. The shrill cries of the ball-
</p>
<p>players were changed to the ferocious war-whoop.
</p>
<p>The warriors snatched from the squaws the hatch-
</p>
<p>ets, which the latter, with this design, had concealed
</p>
<p>beneath their blankets. Some of the Indians as-

</p>
<p>sailed the spectators without, while others rushed
</p>
<p>1763,Jcne.J ESCAPE OF ALEXANDER HENRY. 341
</p>
<p>into the fort, and all was carnage and confusion.
</p>
<p>At the outset, several strong hands had fastened
</p>
<p>their gripe upon Etherington and Leslie, and led
</p>
<p>them away from the scene of massacre towards the
</p>
<p>woods. 1 Within* the area of the fort, the men were
</p>
<p>slaughtered without mercy. But here the task of
</p>
<p>description may well be resigned to the pen of tht*
</p>
<p>trader, Henry.
</p>
<p>" 1 did not go myself to see the match which was
</p>
<p>now to be played without the fort, because, there
</p>
<p>being a canoe prepared to depart on the following
</p>
<p>day for Montreal, I employed myself in writing
</p>
<p>letters to my friends ; and even when a fellow-
</p>
<p>trader, Mr. Tracy, happened to call upon me, say-
</p>
<p>ing that another canoe had just arrived from
</p>
<p>Detroit, and proposing that I should go with him
</p>
<p>to the beach, to inquire the news, it so happened
</p>
<p>that I still remained to finish my letters ; promising
</p>
<p>to follow Mr. Tracy in the course of a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tracy had not gone more than twenty paces
</p>
<p>from my door, when I heard an Indian war-cry,
</p>
<p>and a noise of general confusion.
</p>
<p>" Going instantly to my window, I saw a crowd
</p>
<p>of Indians, within the fort, furiously cutting down
</p>
<p>and scalping every Englishman they found : in
</p>
<p>particular, I witnessed the fate of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Jamette.
</p>
<p>" I had, in the room in which I was, a fowling-
</p>
<p>piece, loaded with swan shot. This I immediately
</p>
<p>seized, and held it for a few minutes, waiting
</p>
<p>to hear the drum beat to arms. In this dreadful

</p>
<p>interval I saw several of my countrymen fall, and
</p>
<p>more than one struggling between the knees of an
</p>
<p>Indian, who, holding him in this manner, scalped
</p>
<p>liim while yet living.
</p>
<p>" At length, disappointed in the hope of seeing
</p>
<p>resistance made to the enemy, and sensible, ol
</p>
<p>course, that no effort of my own unassisted arm
</p>
<p>could avail against four hundred Indians, I thought
</p>
<p>only of seeking shelter amid the slaughter which
</p>
<p>was raging. I observed many of the Canadian
</p>
<p>inhabitants of the fort calmly looking on, neither
</p>
<p>opposing the Indians nor suffering injury ; and
</p>
<p>from this circumstance, I conceived a hope of find-
</p>
<p>ing security in their houses.
</p>
<p>" Between the yard door of my own house and
</p>
<p>that of M. Langlade, 1 my next neighbor, there was
</p>
<p>only a low fence, over which I easily climbed. At
</p>
<p>my entrance, I found the whole family at the win-
</p>
<p>dows, gazing at the scene of blood before them
</p>
<p>I addressed myself immediately to M. Langlade,
</p>
<p>begging that he would put me into some place of
</p>
<p>safety until the heat of the affair should be over ;
</p>
<p>an act of charity by which he might, perhaps, pre-
</p>
<p>serve me from the general massacre ; but while I
</p>
<p>uttered my petition, M. Langlade, who had looked
</p>
<p>for a moment at me, turned again to the window,
</p>
<p>1 Ciiarles Langlade, who is praised by Etherington, though spoken
</p>
<p>of in equivocal terms by Henry, was the son of a Frenchman of good
</p>
<p>family and an Ottawa squaw. He was born at Mackinaw in 1724, and
</p>
<p>served with great reputation as a partisan officer in the old French war.
</p>
<p>He and his father, Augustin Langlade, were the first permanent settlers
</p>
<p>within tlie present State of Wisconsin. He is said to have saved Ether-
</p>
<p>ington and Leslie from the torture. See the Recollections of Augustin Grig

</p>
<p>" This was a moment for despair ; but the next a
</p>
<p>Pani 1 woman, a slave of M. Langlade's, beckoned
</p>
<p>me to follow her. She brought me to a door,
</p>
<p>which she opened, desiring me to enter, and telling
</p>
<p>me that it led to the garret, where I must go and
</p>
<p>conceal myself. I joyfully obeyed her directions ;
</p>
<p>and she, having followed me up to the garret door,
</p>
<p>locked it after me, and, with great presence of
</p>
<p>mind, took away the key.
</p>
<p>" This shelter obtained, if shelter I could hope
</p>
<p>to find it, I was naturally anxious to know what
</p>
<p>might still be passing without. Through an aper-
</p>
<p>ture, which afforded me a view of the area of the
</p>
<p>fort, I beheld, in shapes the foulest and most ter-
</p>
<p>rible, the ferocious triumphs of barbarian conquer-
</p>
<p>ors. The dead were scalped and mangled ; the
</p>
<p>dying were writhing and shrieking under the uusa-
</p>
<p>tiated knife and tomahawk ; and from the bodies
</p>
<p>of some, ripped open, their butchers were drinking
</p>
<p>the blood, scooped up in the hollow of joined hands,
</p>
<p>and quaffed amid shouts of rage and victory. I
</p>
<p>was shaken not only with horror, but with fear.
</p>
<p>The sufferings which I witnessed I seemed on the
</p>
<p>point of experiencing. No long time elapsed before

<p>west of the Mississippi. They were at war with many surrounding

<p>nations, and, among the rest, with the Sacs and Foxes, who often brought
</p>
<p>their prisoners to the French settlements for sale. It thus happened that j

<p>Pawnee slaves were to be found in the principal families of Detroit and

<p>every one being destroyed who could be found J
</p>
<p>there was a general cry of ' All is finished.' At
</p>
<p>the same instant I heard some of the Indians enter
</p>
<p>the house where I was.
</p>
<p>" The garret was separated from the room below
</p>
<p>only by a layer of single boards, at once the floor-
</p>
<p>ing of the one and the ceiling of the other, x
</p>
<p>could, therefore, hear every thing that passed ; and
</p>
<p>the Indians no sooner came in than they inquired
</p>
<p>whether or not any Englishmen were in the house.
</p>
<p>M. Langlade replied, that ' he could not say, he
</p>
<p>did not know of any,' answers in which he did not
</p>
<p>exceed the truth ; for the Pani woman had not
</p>
<p>only hidden me by stealth, but kept my secret and
</p>
<p>her own. M. Langlade was, therefore, as I pre-
</p>
<p>sume, as far from a wish to destroy me as he was
</p>
<p>careless about saving me, when he added to these
</p>
<p>answers, that ' they might examine for themselves,
</p>
<p>and would soon be satisfied as to the object of their
</p>
<p>question.' Saying this, he brought them to the
</p>
<p>garret door.
</p>
<p>" The state of my mind will be imagined. Ar-
</p>
<p>rived at the door, some delay was occasioned by
</p>
<p>the absence of the key ; and a few moments were
</p>
<p>thus allowed me, in which to look around for a
</p>
<p>hiding-place. In one corner of the garret was a
</p>
<p>heap of those vessels of birch bark used in maple-
</p>
<p>sugar making.
</p>
<p>" The door was unlocked and opening, and the
</p>
<p>Indians ascending the stairs, before I had com-
</p>
<p>pletely crept into a small opening which presented

<p>itself at one end of the heap. An instant after

</p>
<p>four Indians entered the room, all armed with
</p>
<p>tomahawks, and all besmeared with blood, upon
</p>
<p>every part of their bodies.
</p>
<p>" The die appeared to be cast. I could scarcely
</p>
<p>breathe ; but I thought the throbbing of my heart
</p>
<p>occasioned a noise loud enough to betray me. The
</p>
<p>Indians walked in every direction about the garret ;
</p>
<p>and one of them approached me so closely, that, at
</p>
<p>a particular moment had he put forth his hand, he
</p>
<p>must have touched me. Still I remained undiscov
</p>
<p>ered ; a circumstance to which the dark color of
</p>
<p>my clothes, and the want of light, in a room which
</p>
<p>had no window in the corner in which I was, must
</p>
<p>have contributed. In a word, after taking several
</p>
<p>turns in the room, during which they told M. Lang-
</p>
<p>lade how many they had killed, and how many
</p>
<p>scalps they had taken, they returned downstairs ;
</p>
<p>and I, with sensations not to be expressed, heard
</p>
<p>the door, which was the barrier between me and
</p>
<p>my fate, locked for the second time.
</p>
<p>" There was a feather bed on the floor ; and on
</p>
<p>this, exhausted as I was by the agitation of my
</p>
<p>mind, I threw myself down and fell asleep. In
</p>
<p>this state I remained till the dusk of the evening,
</p>
<p>when I was awakened by a second opening of the
</p>
<p>door. The person that now entered was M. Lang-
</p>
<p>lade's wife, who was much surprised at finding me,
</p>
<p>but advised me not to be uneasy, observing that the
</p>
<p>Indians had killed most of the English, but that
</p>
<p>she hoped I might myself escape. A shower of
</p>
<p>rain. having begun to fall, she had come to stop a

<p>Her to send me a little water to drink, which she
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>"As night was now advancing, I continued to
</p>
<p>lie on the bed, ruminating on my condition, but
</p>
<p>unable to discover a resource from which I could
</p>
<p>hope for life. A flight to Detroit had no probable
</p>
<p>chance of success. The distance from Michilli-
</p>
<p>mackinac was four hundred miles ; I was without
</p>
<p>provisions, and the whole length of the road lay
</p>
<p>through Indian countries, countries of an enemy
</p>
<p>in arms, where the first man whom I should meet
</p>
<p>would kill me. To stay where I was, threatened
</p>
<p>nearly the same issue. As before, fatigue of mind,
</p>
<p>and not tranquillity, suspended my cares, and pro
</p>
<p>cured me farther sleep.
</p>
<p>" The respite which sleep afforded me during
</p>
<p>the night was put an end to by the return of morn-
</p>
<p>ing. I was again on the rack of apprehension.
</p>
<p>At sunrise, I heard the family stirring ; and, pres-
</p>
<p>ently after, Indian voices, informing M. Langlade
</p>
<p>that they had not found my hapless self among
</p>
<p>the dead, and they supposed ine to be somewhere
</p>
<p>concealed. M. Langlade appeared, from what
</p>
<p>followed, to be, by this time, acquainted with the
</p>
<p>place of my retreat ; of which, no doubt, he had
</p>
<p>been informed by his wife. The poor woman, as
</p>
<p>soon as the Indians mentioned me, declared to her
</p>
<p>husband, in the French tongue, that he should no
</p>
<p>longer keep me in his house, but deliver me up
</p>
<p>to my pursuers ; giving as a reason for this meas-
</p>
<p>ure, that, should the Indians discover his instru-

<p>it on her children, and that it was better that J
</p>
<p>should die than they. M. Langlade resisted, at
</p>
<p>first, this sentence of his wife, but soon suffered
</p>
<p>her to prevail, informing the Indians that lie had
</p>
<p>been told I was in his house ; that I had come
</p>
<p>there without his knowledge, and that he would
</p>
<p>put me into their hands. This was no sooner
</p>
<p>expressed than he began to ascend the stairs, the
</p>
<p>Indians following upon his heels.
</p>
<p>" I now resigned myself to the fate with which
</p>
<p>I was menaced; and, regarding every effort at
</p>
<p>concealment as vain, I rose from the bed, and
</p>
<p>presented myself full in view to the Indians, who
</p>
<p>were entering the room. They were all in a state
</p>
<p>of intoxication, and entirely naked, except about
</p>
<p>the middle. One of them, named Wenniway,
</p>
<p>whom I had previously known, and who was
</p>
<p>upwards of six feet in height, had his entire face
</p>
<p>and body covered with charcoal and grease, only
</p>
<p>that a white spot, of tw^o inches in diameter, encir-
</p>
<p>cled either eye. This man, walking up to me;
</p>
<p>seized me, with one hand, by the collar of the coat,
</p>
<p>while in the other he held a large carving-knife, as
</p>
<p>if to plunge it into my breast ; his eyes, meanwhile,
</p>
<p>were fixed steadfastly on mine. At length, after
</p>
<p>some seconds of the most anxious suspense, he
</p>
<p>dropped his arm, saying, ' I won't kill you ! ' To
</p>
<p>this he added, that he had been frequently engaged
</p>
<p>in wars against the English, and had brought away
</p>
<p>many scalps ; that, on a certain occasion, he had
</p>
<p>lost a brother, whose name was Musinigon, and thai

<p>I should be called after him.

</p>
<p>" A reprieve, upon any terms, placed me among
</p>
<p>the living, and gave me back the sustaining voice
</p>
<p>of hope ; but Wenniway ordered me downstairs,
</p>
<p>and there informing me that I was to be taken to
</p>
<p>his cabin, where, and indeed everywhere else, the
</p>
<p>Indians were all mad with liquor, death again was
</p>
<p>threatened, and not as possible only, but as certain,
</p>
<p>1 mentioned my fears on this subject to M. Langlade,
</p>
<p>begging him to represent the danger to my master.
</p>
<p>M. Langlade, in this instance, did not withhold his
</p>
<p>compassion ; and Wenniway immediately consented
</p>
<p>that I should remain where I was, until he found
</p>
<p>another opportunity to take me away."
</p>
<p>Scarcely, however, had he been gone an hour,
</p>
<p>when an Indian came to the house, and directed
</p>
<p>Henry to follow him to the Ojibwa camp. Henry
</p>
<p>knew this man, who was largely in his debt, and
</p>
<p>some time before, on the trader's asking him for
</p>
<p>payment, the Indian had declared, in a significant
</p>
<p>tone, that he would pay him soon. There seemed
</p>
<p>at present good ground to suspect his intention ;
</p>
<p>but, having no choice, Henry was obliged to follow
</p>
<p>him. The Indian led the way out of the gate ;
</p>
<p>but, instead of going towards the camp, he moved
</p>
<p>with a quick step in the direction of the bushes
</p>
<p>and sand-hills behind the fort. At this, Henry's
</p>
<p>suspicions were confirmed. He refused to proceed
</p>
<p>farther, and plainly told his conductor that he
</p>
<p>believed he meant to kill him. The Indian coolly
</p>
<p>replied that he was quite right in thinking so, and
</p>
<p>at the same time, seizing the prisoner by the arm,

<p>raised his knife to strike him in the breast. Henry

</p>
<p>parried the blow, flung the Indian from him,
</p>
<p>and ran for his life. He gained the gate of the
</p>
<p>fort, his enemy close at his heels, and, seeing Wen-
</p>
<p>niway standing in the centre of the area, called
</p>
<p>upon him for protection. The chief ordered the
</p>
<p>Indian to desist; but the latter, who was foaming
</p>
<p>at the mouth with rage, still continued to pursue
</p>
<p>Henry, vainly striking at him with his knife. See-
</p>
<p>ing the door of Langlade's house wide open, the
</p>
<p>trader darted in, and at length found himself in
</p>
<p>safety. He retired once more to his garret, and lay
</p>
<p>down, feeling, as he declares, a sort of conviction
</p>
<p>that no Indian had power to harm him.
</p>
<p>This confidence was somewhat shaken when,
</p>
<p>early in the night, he was startled from sleep by
</p>
<p>the opening of the door. A light gleamed in upon
</p>
<p>him, and he was summoned to descend. He did
</p>
<p>so, when, to his surprise and joy, he found, in
</p>
<p>the room below, Captain Etherington, Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Leslie, and Mr. Bostwick, a trader, together with
</p>
<p>Father Jonois, the Jesuit priest from L'Arbre
</p>
<p>Croche. The Indians were bent on enjoying that
</p>
<p>night a grand debauch upon the liquor they had
</p>
<p>seized ; and the chiefs, well knowing the extreme
</p>
<p>danger to which the prisoners would be exposed
</p>
<p>during these revels, had conveyed them all into the
</p>
<p>fort, and placed them in charge of the Canadians.
</p>
<p>Including officers, soldiers, and traders, they
</p>
<p>amounted to about twenty men, being nearly all
</p>
<p>who had escaped the massacre.

</p>
<p>debate. These men had supped full of horrors ;
</p>
<p>yet they were almost on the point of risking a
</p>
<p>renewal of the bloodshed from which they had
</p>
<p>just escaped. The temptation was a strong one
</p>
<p>The fort was this evening actually in the hands of
</p>
<p>the white men. The Indians, with their ordinary
</p>
<p>recklessness and improvidence, had neglected even
</p>
<p>to place a guard within the palisades. They were
</p>
<p>now, one and all, in their camp, mad with liquor,
</p>
<p>and the fort was occupied by twenty Englishmen,
</p>
<p>and about three hundred Canadians, principally
</p>
<p>voyageurs. To close the gates, and set the Indians
</p>
<p>at defiance, seemed no very difficult matter. It
</p>
<p>might have been attempted, but for the dissuasions
</p>
<p>of the Jesuit, who had acted throughout the part
</p>
<p>of a true friend of humanity, and who now strongly
</p>
<p>represented the probability that the Canadians would
</p>
<p>prove treacherous, and the certainty that a failure
</p>
<p>would involve destruction to every Englishman in
</p>
<p>the place. The idea was therefore abandoned,
</p>
<p>and Captain Etherington, with his companions,
</p>
<p>that night shared Henry's garret, where they
</p>
<p>passed the time in condoling with each other on
</p>
<p>their common misfortune.
</p>
<p>A party of Indians came to the house in the
</p>
<p>morning, and ordered Henry to follow them out.
</p>
<p>The weather had changed, and a cold storm had
</p>
<p>set in. In the dreary and forlorn area of the fort
</p>
<p>were a few of the Indian conquerors, though the
</p>
<p>main body were still in their camp, not yet recov-
</p>
<p>ered from the effects of their last night's carouse.

<p>Henry's conductors led him to a house, where in a
</p>
<p>'763, Juke.] INTERVENTION OF THE OTTAWAS. 351
</p>
<p>room almost dark, he saw two traders and a soldier
</p>
<p>imprisoned. They were released, and directed to
</p>
<p>follow the party. The whole then proceeded
</p>
<p>together to the lake shore, where they were to
</p>
<p>embark for the Isles du Castor. A chilling wind
</p>
<p>blew strongly from the north-east, and the lake
</p>
<p>was covered with mists, and tossing angrily. Henry
</p>
<p>stood shivering on the beach, with no other uppei
</p>
<p>garment than a shirt, drenched with the cold rain.
</p>
<p>He asked Langlade, who was near him, for a
</p>
<p>blanket, which the latter refused unless security
</p>
<p>were given for payment. Another Canadian proved
</p>
<p>more merciful, and Henrv received a covering from
</p>
<p>the weather. With his three companions, guarded
</p>
<p>by seven Indians, he embarked in the canoe, the
</p>
<p>soldier being tied by his neck to one of the cross-
</p>
<p>bars of the vessel. The thick mists and the tem-
</p>
<p>pestuous weather compelled them to coast the
</p>
<p>shore, close beneath the wet dripping forests. In
</p>
<p>this manner they had proceeded about eighteen
</p>
<p>miles, and were approaching L'Arbre Croche, when
</p>
<p>an Ottawa Indian came out of the woods, and called
</p>
<p>to them from the beach, inquiring the news, and
</p>
<p>asking who were their prisoners. Some conversa-
</p>
<p>tion followed, in the course of which the canoe
</p>
<p>approached the shore, where the water was very
</p>
<p>shallow. All at once, a loud yell was heard, and a
</p>
<p>hundred Ottawas, rising from among the trees and
</p>
<p>bushes, rushed into the water, and seized upon the
</p>
<p>canoe and prisoners. The astonished Ojibwaa
</p>
<p>remonstrated in vain. The four Englishmen were

<p>taken from them, and led in safety to the shore.

</p>
<p>Good will to the prisoners, however, had by no
</p>
<p>means prompted the Ottawas to this very unex
</p>
<p>pected proceeding. They were jealous and angry
</p>
<p>that the Ojibwas should have taken the fort with-
</p>
<p>out giving them an opportunity to share in the
</p>
<p>plunder ; and they now took this summary mode
</p>
<p>of asserting their rights.
</p>
<p>The chiefs, however, shook Henry and his com-
</p>
<p>panions by the hand, professing great good will,
</p>
<p>assuring them, at the same time, that the Ojibwas
</p>
<p>were carrying them to the Isles du Castor merely
</p>
<p>to kill and eat them. The four prisoners, the
</p>
<p>sport of so many changing fortunes, soon found
</p>
<p>themselves embarked in an Ottawa canoe, and on
</p>
<p>their way back to Michillimackinac. They were
</p>
<p>not alone. A flotilla of canoes accompanied them,
</p>
<p>bearing a great number of Ottawa warriors ; and
</p>
<p>before the day was over, the whole had arrived at
</p>
<p>the fort. At this time, the principal Ojibwa
</p>
<p>encampment was near the woods, in full sight
</p>
<p>of the landing-place. Its occupants, astonished at
</p>
<p>this singular movement on the part of their rivals,
</p>
<p>stood looking on in silent amazement, while the
</p>
<p>Ottawa warriors, well armed, filed into the fort, and
</p>
<p>took possession of it.
</p>
<p>This conduct is not difficult to explain, when we
</p>
<p>take into consideration the peculiarities of the Indi-
</p>
<p>an character. Pride and jealousy are always strong
</p>
<p>and active elements in it. The Ottawas deemed
</p>
<p>themselves insulted because the Ojibwas had under-
</p>
<p>taken an enterprise of such importance without

</p>
<p>be added, that the Indians of L'Arbre Croche were
</p>
<p>somewhat less hostile to the English than the
</p>
<p>neighboring tribes ; for the great influence of the
</p>
<p>priest Jonois seems always to have been exerted
</p>
<p>on the side of peace.
</p>
<p>The English prisoners looked upon the new-
</p>
<p>comers as champions and protectors, and conceived
</p>
<p>hopes from their interference not destined to be
</p>
<p>fully realized. On the morning after their arrival,
</p>
<p>the Ojibwa chiefs invited the principal men of the
</p>
<p>Ottawas to hold a council with them, in a building
</p>
<p>within the fort. They placed upon the floor a val-
</p>
<p>uable present of goods, which were part of the
</p>
<p>plunder they had taken ; and their great war-chief,
</p>
<p>Minavavana, who had conducted the attack, rose
</p>
<p>and addressed the Ottawas.
</p>
<p>Their conduct, he said, had greatly surprised
</p>
<p>him. They had betrayed the common cause, and
</p>
<p>opposed the will of the Great Spirit, who had de-
</p>
<p>creed that every Englishman must die. Excepting
</p>
<p>them, all the Indians had raised the hatchet. Pon-
</p>
<p>tiac had taken Detroit, and every other fort had
</p>
<p>also been destroyed. The English were meeting
</p>
<p>with destruction throughout the whole world, and
</p>
<p>the King of France was awakened from his sleep.
</p>
<p>He exhorted them, in conclusion, no longer to
</p>
<p>espouse the cause of the English, but, like their
</p>
<p>brethren, to lift the hatchet against them.
</p>
<p>When Minavavana had concluded his speech, the
</p>
<p>council adjourned until the next day ; a custom
</p>
<p>common among Indians, in order that the auditors
</p>
<p>may have time to ponder with due deliberatioo

</p>
<p>upon what they have heard. At the next meeting,
</p>
<p>the Ottawas expressed a readiness to concur with
</p>
<p>the views of the Ojibwas. Thus the difference
</p>
<p>between the two tribes was at length amicably ad
</p>
<p>justed. The Ottawas returned to the Ojibwas some
</p>
<p>of the prisoners whom they had taken from them ;
</p>
<p>still, however, retaining the officers and several of
</p>
<p>the soldiers. These they soon after carried to
</p>
<p>L'Arbre Croche, where they were treated with
</p>
<p>kindness, probably owing to the influence of Fa-
</p>
<p>ther Jonois. 1 The priest went down to Detroit
</p>
<p>with a letter from Captain Etherington, acquaint-
</p>
<p>ing Major Gladwyn with the loss of Michillimack-
</p>
<p>inac, and entreating that a force might be sent
</p>
<p>immediately to his aid. The letter, as we have
</p>
<p>seen, was safely delivered ; but Gladwyn was, of
</p>
<p>course, unable to render the required assistance.
</p>
<p>Though the Ottawas and Ojibwas had come to
</p>
<p>terms, they still looked on each other with distrust
</p>
<p>and it is said that the former never forgot the
</p>
<p>slight that had been put upon them. The Ojibwas
</p>
<p>took the prisoners who had been returned to them
</p>
<p>from the fort, and carried them to one of their
</p>
<p>small villages, which stood near the shore, at no
</p>
<p>great distance to the south-east. Among the other
</p>
<p>lodges was a large one, of the kind often seen in
</p>
<p>Indian villages, erected for use on public occasions,
</p>
<p>such as dances, feasts, or councils. It was now
</p>
<p>to serve as a prison. The soldiers were bound
</p>
<p>together, two and two, and farther secured by long
</p>
<p>ropes tied round their necks, and fastened to the
</p>
<p>pole which supported the lodge in the centre.

<p>i763. Junb.i SPEECH OF WAWATAM. 3o5
</p>
<p>Henry and the other traders escaped this rigorous
</p>
<p>treatment. The spacious lodge was soon filled
</p>
<p>with Indians, who came to look at their captives,
</p>
<p>and gratify themselves by deriding and jeering at
</p>
<p>them. At the head of the lodge sat the great war-
</p>
<p>chief Minavavana, side by side with Henry's master,
</p>
<p>Wenniway. Things had remained for some time
</p>
<p>in this position, when Henry observed an Indian
</p>
<p>stooping to enter at the low aperture which served
</p>
<p>for a door, and, to his great joy, recognized his
</p>
<p>friend and brother, Wawatam, whom he had last
</p>
<p>seen on the day before the massacre. Wawatam
</p>
<p>said nothing ; but, as he passed the' trader, he
</p>
<p>shook him by the hand, in token of encouragement,
</p>
<p>and, proceeding to the head of the lodge, sat down
</p>
<p>with Wenniway and the war-chief. After he had
</p>
<p>smoked with them for a while in silence, he rose
</p>
<p>and went out again. Very soon he came back,
</p>
<p>followed by his squaw, who brought in her hands
</p>
<p>a valuable present, which she laid at the feet of
</p>
<p>the two chiefs. Wawatam then addressed them
</p>
<p>in the following speech : 
</p>
<p>" Friends and relations, what is it that I shall
</p>
<p>say] You know what I feel. You all have
</p>
<p>friends, and brothers, and children, whom as your-
</p>
<p>selves you love ; and you,  what would you ex-
</p>
<p>perience, did you, like me, behold your dearest
</p>
<p>friend  your brother  in the condition of a slave ;
</p>
<p>a slave, exposed every moment to insult, and to
</p>
<p>menaces of death ] This case, as you all know, ia

<p>mine. See there, [pointing to Henry,] my friend

<p>and brother among; slaves,  himself a slave !
</p>
<p>3o6 THE MASSACRE. [1763, Junb,
</p>
<p>" You all well know that, long before the war
</p>
<p>began, I adopted him as my brother. From that
</p>
<p>moment he became one of my family, so that no
</p>
<p>change of circumstances could break the cord
</p>
<p>which fastened us together.
</p>
<p>" He is my brother ; and because I am your
</p>
<p>relation, he is therefore your relation too ; and
</p>
<p>how, being your relation, can he be your sla\e'?
</p>
<p>" On the day on which the war began, you were
</p>
<p>fearful lest, on this very account, I should reveal
</p>
<p>your secret. You requested, therefore, that I would
</p>
<p>leave the fort, and even cross the lake. I did so ;
</p>
<p>but I did it with reluctance. I did it with reluc-
</p>
<p>tance, notwithstanding that you, Minavavana, who
</p>
<p>had the command in this enterprise, gave me your
</p>
<p>promise that you would protect my friend, deliver
</p>
<p>ing him from all danger, and giving him safely to
</p>
<p>me.
</p>
<p>" The performance of this promise I now claim.
</p>
<p>I come not with empty hands to ask it. You, Min-
</p>
<p>avavana, best know whether or not, as it respects
</p>
<p>yourself, you have kept your word ; but I bring
</p>
<p>these goods to buy off every claim which any man
</p>
<p>among you all may have on my brother as his
</p>
<p>prisoner." 1
</p>
<p>To this speech the war-chief returned a favor-
</p>
<p>able answer. Wawatam's request was acceded to,
</p>
<p>1 Henry, Travels, 102. The authenticity of this very interesting bock
</p>
<p>has never been questioned. Henry was living at Montreal as late as the
</p>
<p>year 1809. In 1797 he, with others, claimed, in virtue of Indian grants,
</p>
<p>a large tract of land west of the River Cuyahoga, in the present State of
</p>
<p>Ohio. A letter from him is extant, dated in April of that year, in which

</p>
<p>the present was accepted, and the prisoner re-
</p>
<p>leased. Henry soon found himself in the lodge of
</p>
<p>his friend, where furs were spread for him to lie
</p>
<p>upon, food and drink brought for his refreshment,
</p>
<p>and every thing done to promote his comfort that
</p>
<p>[ndian hospitality could suggest. As he lay in the
</p>
<p>lodge, on the day after his release, he heard a loud
</p>
<p>noise from within the prison-house, which stood close
</p>
<p>at hand, and, looking through a crevice in the bark,
</p>
<p>he saw the dead bodies of seven soldiers dragged
</p>
<p>out. It appeared that a noted chief had just
</p>
<p>arrived from his wintering ground. Having come
</p>
<p>too late to take part in the grand achievement of
</p>
<p>his countrymen, he was anxious to manifest to all
</p>
<p>present his entire approval of what had been done,
</p>
<p>and with this design he had entered the lodge and
</p>
<p>despatched seven of the prisoners with his knife
</p>
<p>The Indians are not habitual cannibals. Aftei
</p>
<p>a victory, however, it often happens that the bodies
</p>
<p>of their enemies are consumed at a formal war-
</p>
<p>feast  a superstitious rite, adapted, as they think,
</p>
<p>to increase their courage and hardihood. Such a
</p>
<p>feast took place on the present occasion, and most
</p>
<p>of the chiefs partook of it, though some of them,
</p>
<p>at least, did so with repugnance.
</p>
<p>About a week had now elapsed since the mas-
</p>
<p>sacre* and a revulsion of feeling began to take
</p>
<p>place among the Indians. Up to this time all had
</p>
<p>been triumph and exultation ; but they now began
</p>
<p>to fear the consequences of their conduct. In-

</p>
<p>and, in their growing uneasiness, they thought it
</p>
<p>expedient to shift their position to some point
</p>
<p>more capable of defence. Three hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty warriors, with their families and household
</p>
<p>effects, embarked in canoes for the Island of Mich
</p>
<p>illimackinac, seven or eight miles distant. Wa
</p>
<p>watam, with his friend Henry, was of the number.
</p>
<p>Strong gusts of wind came from the north, and
</p>
<p>when the fleet of canoes was half way to the Island,
</p>
<p>it blew a gale, the waves pitching and tossing with
</p>
<p>such violence, that the frail and heavy-laden vessels
</p>
<p>were much endangered. Many voices were raised
</p>
<p>in prayer to the Great Spirit, and a dog was thrown
</p>
<p>into the lake, as a sacrifice to appease the angry
</p>
<p>manitou of the waters. The canoes weathered the
</p>
<p>storm, and soon drew near the island. Two squaws,
</p>
<p>in the same canoe with Henry, raised their voices
</p>
<p>in mournful wailing and lamentation. Late events
</p>
<p>had made him sensible to every impression of hor-
</p>
<p>ror, and these dismal cries seemed ominous of some
</p>
<p>new disaster, until he learned that they were called
</p>
<p>forth by the recollection of dead relatives, whose
</p>
<p>graves were visible upon a neighboring point of the
</p>
<p>shore.
</p>
<p>The Island of Michillimackinac, or Mackinaw,
</p>
<p>owing to its situation, its beauty, and the fish which
</p>
<p>the surrounding water supplied, had long been a
</p>
<p>favorite resort of Indians. It is about three miles
</p>
<p>wide. So clear are the waters of Lake Huron,

<p>at some period, the island had served as a grand

<p>depository for the dead ; yet of these remains the

<p>present race of Indians can give no account. Le-

<p>gends and superstitions attached a mysterious celeb-

<p>rity to the place, and here, it was said, the fairies of
</p>
<p>Indian tradition might often be seen dancing upon
</p>
<p>the white rocks, or basking in the moonlight. 1

<p>The Indians landed at the margin of a little bay.
</p>
<p>Unlading their canoes, and lifting them high and

<p>dry upon the beach, they began to erect their
</p>
<p>lodges, and before night had completed the work.

<p>" Their tradition concerning the name of this little island is curious
</p>
<p>They say that Michapous, the chief of spirits, sojourned long in that
</p>
<p>vicinity. They believed that a mountain on the border of the lake was
</p>
<p>the place of his abode, and they called it by his name. It was here, say
</p>
<p>they, that he first instructed man to fabricate nets for taking fish, and
</p>
<p>where he has collected the greatest quantity of these finny inhabitants of
</p>
<p>the waters. On the island he left spirits, named Imakinakos ; and from
</p>
<p>these aerial possessors it has received the appellation of Michillimakinac.
</p>
<p>"When the savages, in those quarters, make a feast of fish, they
</p>
<p>invoke the spirits of the island, thank them for their bounty, and entreat
</p>
<p>them to continue their protection to their families. They demand of them
</p>
<p>to preserve their nets and canoes from the swelling and destructive bil-
</p>
<p>lows, when the lakes are agitated by storms. All who assist in the cere-
</p>
<p>mony lengthen their voices together, which is an act of gratitude. In

<p>360 THE MASSACRE. [17fi5, June
</p>
<p>Messengers arrived on the next day from Pontiac,
</p>
<p>informing them that he was besieging Detroit,
</p>
<p>and urging them to come to his aid. But their
</p>
<p>warlike ardor had well-nigh died out. A sense-
</p>
<p>less alarm prevailed among them, and they now
</p>
<p>thought more of securing their own safety than of
</p>
<p>injuring the enemy. A vigilant watch was kept up
</p>
<p>all day, and the unusual precaution taken of plac-
</p>
<p>ing guards at night. Their fears, however, did
</p>
<p>not prevent them from seizing two English trad-
</p>
<p>ing canoes, which had come from Montreal by
</p>
<p>way of the Ottawa. Among the booty found in
</p>
<p>them was a quantity of whiskey, and a general
</p>
<p>debauch was the immediate result. As night
</p>
<p>closed in, the dolorous chanting of drunken songs
</p>
<p>was heard from within the lodges, the prelude of a
</p>
<p>scene of riot ; and Wawatam, knowing that his
</p>
<p>friend Henry's life would be in danger, privately
</p>
<p>led him out of the camp to a cavern in the hills,
</p>
<p>towards the interior of the island. Here the trader
</p>
<p>spent the night, in a solitude made doubly dreary
</p>
<p>by a sense of his forlorn and perilous situation
</p>
<p>On waking in the morning, he found that he had
</p>
<p>been lying on human bones, which covered the
</p>
<p>floor of the cave. The place had anciently served
</p>
<p>as a charnel-house. Here he spent another solitary
</p>
<p>night, before his friend came to apprise him that
</p>
<p>he might return with safety to the camp.
</p>
<p>Famine soon began among the Indians, who
</p>
<p>were sometimes without food for days together.

<p>the privation with that resignation under inevit-

</p>
<p>cross over to the north shore of Lake Huron,

<p>where fish were more abundant; and here they

<p>and spent a lonely winter among the frozen forests,

<p>hunting the bear and moose for subsistence. 1
</p>
<p>The posts of Green Bay and the Sault Ste. Marie
</p>
<p>did not share the fate of Michillimackinac. During
</p>
<p>the preceding winter, Ste. Marie had been partially
</p>
<p>destroyed by an accidental fire, and was therefore

<p>abandoned, the garrison withdrawing to Michilli-

<p>1 The following description of Minavavana, or the Grand Sauteur, who
</p>
<p>was the leader of the Ojibwas at the massacre of Michillimackinac, is
</p>
<p>drawn from Carver's Travels : 
</p>
<p>" The first I accosted were Chipeways, inhabiting near the Ottowaw
</p>
<p>lakes ; who received me with great cordiality, and shook me by the hand,
</p>
<p>m token of friendship. At some little distance behind these stood a chief
</p>
<p>remarkably tall and well made, but of so stern an aspect that the most
</p>
<p>undaunted person could not behold him without feeling some degree of
</p>
<p>terror. He seemed to have passed the meridian of life, and by the mode
</p>
<p>in which he was painted and tatowed, I discovered that he was of high
</p>
<p>rank. However, I approached him in a courteous manner, and expected
</p>
<p>to have met with the same reception I had done from the others ; but, to
</p>
<p>my great surprise, he withheld i.is hand, and looking fiercely at me, said,
</p>
<p>in the Chipeway tongue, ' Cawin nishishin saganosh,' that is, ' The English
</p>
<p>are no good.' As he had his tomahawk in his hand, I expected that this
</p>
<p>laconick sentence would have been followed by a blow ; to prevent which
</p>
<p>I drew a pistol from my belt, and, holding it in a careless position, passed

<p>close by him, to let him see I was not afraid of him. . . . Since I came

<p>to England, I have been informed, that the Grand Sautor, having ren-

<p>dered himself more and more disgustful to the English by his inveterate

<p>enmity towards them, was at length stabbed in his tent, as he encamped

</p>
<p>massacre. The fort at Green Bay first received an
</p>
<p>English garrison in the year 1761, at the same time
</p>
<p>with the other posts of this region. The force
</p>
<p>consisted of seventeen men. of the 60th or Royal
</p>
<p>American regiment, commanded by Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Gorell. Though so few in number, their duties
</p>
<p>were of a very important character. In the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood of Green Bay were numerous and power-
</p>
<p>ful Indian tribes. The Menomonies lived at the
</p>
<p>mouth of Fox River, close to the fort. The Win-
</p>
<p>nebagoes had several villages on the lake which
</p>
<p>bears their name, and the Sacs and Foxes were
</p>
<p>established on the River Wisconsin, in a large vil-
</p>
<p>lage composed of houses neatly built of logs and
</p>
<p>bark, and surrounded by fields of corn and vegeta-
</p>
<p>bles. 1 West of the Mississippi was the powerful
</p>
<p>nation of the Dahcotah, whose strength was loosely
</p>
<p>estimated at thirty thousand fighting men, and
</p>
<p>who, in the excess of their haughtiness, styled the
</p>
<p>surrounding tribes their dogs and slaves. 2 The
</p>
<p>commandant of Green Bay was the representative
</p>
<p>of the British government, in communication with
</p>
<p>all these tribes. It devolved upon him to secure
</p>
<p>their friendship, and keep them at peace ; and he
</p>
<p>was also intrusted, in a great measure, with the
</p>
<p>power of regulating the fur-trade among them. In
</p>
<p>the course of each season, parties of Indians, from
</p>
<p>every quarter, would come to the fort, each expect-
</p>
<p>ing to be received with speeches and presents.

<p>Robert Gilmor, Esq.
</p>
<p>1763, Jcne.1 TACT OF GORELL 363
</p>
<p>Gorell seems to have acquitted himself with great
</p>
<p>judgment and prudence. On first arriving at the
</p>
<p>fort, he had found its defences decayed and ruin-
</p>
<p>ous, the Canadian inhabitants unfriendly, and many
</p>
<p>of the Indians disposed to hostility. His good
</p>
<p>conduct contributed to allay their irritation, and
</p>
<p>he was particularly successful in conciliating his
</p>
<p>immediate neighbors, the Menomonies. They had
</p>
<p>taken an active part in the late war between France
</p>
<p>and England, and their spirits were humbled by the
</p>
<p>losses they had sustained, as well as by recent rav-
</p>
<p>ages of the small-pox. Gorell summoned them to
</p>
<p>a council, and delivered a speech, in which he
</p>
<p>avoided wounding their pride, but at the same time
</p>
<p>assumed a tone of firmness and decision, such as
</p>
<p>can alone command an Indian's respect. He told
</p>
<p>them that the King of England had heard of their
</p>
<p>ill conduct, but that he was ready to forget all that
</p>
<p>had passed. If, however, they should again give
</p>
<p>him cause of complaint, he would send an army,
</p>
<p>numerous as the trees of the forest, and utterly
</p>
<p>destroy them. Flattering expressions of confidence
</p>
<p>and esteem succeeded, and the whole was enforced
</p>
<p>by the distribution of a few presents. The Meno
</p>
<p>monies replied by assurances of friendship, more
</p>
<p>sincerely made and faithfully kept than could have
</p>
<p>been expected. As Indians of the other tribe?
</p>
<p>came from time to time to the fort, they met with
</p>
<p>a similar reception ; and, in his whole intercourse
</p>
<p>with them, the constant aim of the commandant
</p>
<p>was to gain their good will. The result was most

<p>happy for himself and his garrison.

<p>3b4 THE MASSAdvE. [1",G3,June
</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of June, 1763, an Ottawa Indian
</p>
<p>brought to Gorell the following letter from Captain
</p>
<p>Etherington : 
</p>
<p>" Michillimackinac, June 11, 1763
</p>
<p>' Dear Sir :
</p>
<p>" This place was taken by surprise, on the sec
</p>
<p>ond instant, by the Chippeways, [Ojibwas,] at which
</p>
<p>time Lieutenant Jamet and twenty [fifteen] more
</p>
<p>were killed, and all the rest taken prisoners ; but
</p>
<p>our good friends, the Ottawas, have taken Lieuten-
</p>
<p>ant Lesley, me, and eleven men, out of their hands,
</p>
<p>and have promised to reinstate us again. You'll
</p>
<p>therefore, on the receipt of this, which I send by
</p>
<p>a canoe of Ottawas, set out with all your garrison,
</p>
<p>and what English traders you have with you, and
</p>
<p>come with the Indian who gives you this, who will
</p>
<p>conduct you safe to me. You must be sure to fol
</p>
<p>low the instruction you receive from the bearer of
</p>
<p>this, as you are by no means to come to this post
</p>
<p>before you see me at the village, twenty miles from
</p>
<p>this. ... I must once more beg you'll lose no
</p>
<p>time in coming to join me ; at the same time, be
</p>
<p>very careful, and always be on your guard. I long
</p>
<p>much to see you, and am, dear sir,
</p>
<p>" Your most humble serv't.

<p>Menomonies to a council, told them what the Ojib
</p>
<p>i763,June.| GREEN BAY ABANDONED. <365
</p>
<p>was had done, and said that he and his soldiers
</p>
<p>were going to Michillimackinac to restore order ;
</p>
<p>adding, that during his absence he commended the
</p>
<p>fort to their care. Great numbers of the Winne-
</p>
<p>bagoes and of the Sacs and Foxes afterwards
</p>
<p>arrived, and Gorell addressed them in nearly the
</p>
<p>same words. Presents were given them, and it
</p>
<p>soon appeared that the greater part were well dis
</p>
<p>posed towards the English, though a few were
</p>
<p>inclined to prevent their departure, and even to
</p>
<p>threaten hostility. At this juncture, a fortunate
</p>
<p>incident occurred. A Dahcotah chief arrived with
</p>
<p>a message from his people to the following import :
</p>
<p>They had heard, he said, of the bad conduct of the
</p>
<p>Ojibwas. They hoped that the tribes of Green
</p>
<p>Bay would not follow their example, but, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, would protect the English garrison. Un-
</p>
<p>less they did so, the Dahcotah would fall upon
</p>
<p>them, and take ample revenge. This auspicious
</p>
<p>interference must, no doubt, be ascribed to the
</p>
<p>hatred with which the Dahcotah had long regarded
</p>
<p>the Ojibwas. That the latter should espouse one
</p>
<p>side of the quarrel, was abundant reason to the
</p>
<p>Dahcotah for adopting the other.
</p>
<p>Some of the Green Bay Indians were also at
</p>
<p>enmity with the Ojibwas, and all opposition to the
</p>
<p>departure of the English was now at an end. In-
</p>
<p>deed, some of the more friendly offered to escort
</p>
<p>the garrison on its way ; and on the twenty-first of
</p>
<p>June, Gorell's party embarked in several bateaux,

</p>
<p>366 THE MASSACRE. |17C,a, July
</p>
<p>proaching Isle du Castor, near the mouth of Green
</p>
<p>Bay, an alarm was given that the Ojibwas were
</p>
<p>lying there in ambush ; on which the Menomonies
</p>
<p>raised the war-song, stripped themselves, and pre-
</p>
<p>pared to do battle in behalf of the English. The
</p>
<p>alarm, however, proved false ; and, having crossed
</p>
<p>Lake Michigan in safety, the party arrived at the
</p>
<p>village of L'Arbre Croche on the thirtieth. The
</p>
<p>Ottawas came down to the beach, to salute them
</p>
<p>with a discharge of guns ; and, on landing, they
</p>
<p>were presented with the pipe of peace. Captain
</p>
<p>Etherington and Lieutenant Leslie, with eleven
</p>
<p>men, were in the village, detained as prisoners,
</p>
<p>though treated with kindness. It was thought that
</p>
<p>the Ottawas intended to disarm the party of Gorell
</p>
<p>also ; but the latter gave out that he would resist
</p>
<p>such an attempt, and his soldiers were permitted
</p>
<p>to retain their weapons.
</p>
<p>Several succeeding days were occupied by the
</p>
<p>Indians in holding councils. Those from Green
</p>
<p>Bay requested the Ottawas to set their prisoners
</p>
<p>at liberty, and they at length assented. A diffi-
</p>
<p>culty still remained, as the Ojibwas had declared
</p>
<p>that they would prevent the English from passing
</p>
<p>down to Montreal. Their chiefs were therefore
</p>
<p>summoned ; and being at this time, as we have
</p>
<p>seen, in a state of much alarm, they at length re-
</p>
<p>luctantly yielded the point. On the eighteenth of
</p>
<p>July, the English, escorted by a fleet of Indian
</p>
<p>canoes, left L'Arbre Croche, and reaching, without
