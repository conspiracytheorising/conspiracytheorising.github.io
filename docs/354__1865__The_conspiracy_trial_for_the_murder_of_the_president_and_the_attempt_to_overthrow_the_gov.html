<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he seem to be cutting at his head or throat? or where?
</p>
<p>A. He seemed to be cutting down around his neck. The first
</p>
<p>time he struck at him, he struck him on the right cheek.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe how he held the knife, and struck with it ?
</p>
<p>A. The knife was held with the blade down. The knife was
</p>
<p>below his hand.
</p>
<p>Q. Did it seem to be a large knife?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q, Did he say any thing at all while stabbing him ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not hear him say any thing.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you afterwards observe the wounds that were inflicted by
</p>
<p>his knife ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a knife to the witness.] Look at that knife, and
</p>
<p>say if that is the knife that he used.
</p>
<p>A. It was about the length of this ; but it looked as though it
</p>
<p>was not so wide as this one. He held it elevated in his right hand,
</p>
<p>with the blade down.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you mention the number, and describe the character, of
</p>
<p>the wounds that were inflicted on Mr. Seward by him ?
</p>
<p>A. There was one cuttino; his face from the rio-ht cheek down to
</p>
<p>his neck ; and then there was another cut, or perhaps it was the
</p>
<p>same one, on his neck. I thought at the time that it was done by the
</p>
<p>same blow. He was sitting partially up in bed at the time. I
</p>
<p>thought both cuts were made at once. And then there was one on
</p>
<p>the left side of the neck.
</p>
<p>Q. Three wounds in all ?

<p>4 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, that I noticed. It was all blood when I saw it ;
</p>
<p>and I do not know but that there may have been more.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Mr. Seward in his bed at the time?
</p>
<p>A. He was.
</p>
<p>Q. From what cause ?
</p>
<p>A. From beino; thrown from his camaoje.
</p>
<p>Q . Were one or more of his limbs broken ?
</p>
<p>A. I was told that one of his arms was broken ; he had it band-
</p>
<p>aged up : and his jaw was fractured.
</p>
<p>Q. While being stabbed, did Mr. Seward get out of his bed, or
</p>
<p>did he remain ?
</p>
<p>A. He remained.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he receive all the stabs in his bed ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, during the struggle, roll from his bed, or remain in it ?
</p>
<p>A. He rolled out of bed after we had left the bed. When I
</p>
<p>went back to the bed, I found that he was lying on the floor.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that this man, during the whole of this bloody work,
</p>
<p>made no remark at all ?  said nothing ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not hear him make any remark.
</p>
<p>Q. When he came out of the room, had Frederick Seward risen
</p>
<p>from the floor ? or was he still on it ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see Frederick down at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was he when this man came out?
</p>
<p>A. The first I saw of Frederick, he was in the room standino:
</p>
<p>up. When I came back into the room, he was inside the door,
</p>
<p>standing in the room.
</p>
<p>Q. With what did this man strike you? You say he knocked
</p>
<p>you down when he came out of the room ?
</p>
<p>A. He struck me with his fist. He had wound his arm around
</p>
<p>my neck ; but he let me go, and struck me with his fist.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he immediately go down the stairway then ?
</p>
<p>A. He did.

</p>
<p>Q, Did you see him encounter Major Seward ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see that.
</p>
<p>Q. After he left, was any thing picked up which he had left
</p>
<p>behind him ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL, 5
</p>
<p>A. There was a revolver, or parts of one.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any part of his clothes  his hat or coat  left behind ?
</p>
<p>A. His hat was left. The first I saw of it was in the room.
</p>
<p>Q, [Exhibiting to the witness a slouch felt hat.] Will you look
</p>
<p>at that hat, and see if you recognize it ?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge that to be the hat : I did not take particular
</p>
<p>notice of it. It looks like ihQ hat that was found there.
</p>
<p>[The hat was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Exhibiting a revolver to the witness.] Will you look at that
</p>
<p>revolver, and see if you recognize it ?
</p>
<p>A. That is the revolver, excepting that part [the ramrod, which
</p>
<p>was disconnected] : I did not see that part.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the revolver which was picked up in the room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>[The revolver was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. The Mr. Seward you spoke of as being in bed was William
</p>
<p>H. Seward, Secretary of State?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Seward reside at that time in Washington City?
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. His house, of which you spoke, was in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>At the request of General Wallace, an orderly was directed to
</p>
<p>place the hat on the head of the prisoner Payne, to see if it fitted
</p>
<p>him or not ; which was done, Payne smiling pleasantly.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. Does it fit pretty loose, or pretty tight ?
</p>
<p>The Orderly. Pretty tight.
</p>
<p>Major A. H. Seward,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you or not the son of the Hon. William H. Seward,
</p>
<p>Secretary of State ?

</p>
<p>6 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Were yoa or not at his home, in this city, on the night of
</p>
<p>the 14th of April last ?
</p>
<p>A. T was.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, on that night, any one of tbe prisoners
</p>
<p>at the bar made bis appearance at that house. Look at them.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw this large man, with no coat on, that night
</p>
<p>[pointing to Lewis Payne].
</p>
<p>Q. State all the circumstances attending your meeting with him.
</p>
<p>A. I retired to bed at half-past seven on the night of the 14th,
</p>
<p>with the understanding that I would be called about eleven o'clock
</p>
<p>to sit up with my father. I very shortly fell asleep, and so remained
</p>
<p>until awakened by the screams of my sister ; when I jumped out of
</p>
<p>bed, and ran into my father's room in my shirt and drawers. The
</p>
<p>gas in the room was turned down rather low ; and I saw what
</p>
<p>appeared to me to be two men, one trying to hold the other, at the
</p>
<p>foot of my father's bed. I seized, by the clothes on bis breast, the
</p>
<p>person who was held, supposing it was my father, delirious ; but,
</p>
<p>immediately on taking hold of him, I knew from his size and
</p>
<p>strength that it was not my father. The thought then struck me
</p>
<p>that the nurse bad become delirious, and was sticking; about tbe
</p>
<p>room at random. Knowing the delicate state of my father, I shoved
</p>
<p>the person of whom I had hold to the door, with the intention of
</p>
<p>getting him out of the room. While I was pushing him, he struck
</p>
<p>me five or six times on the forehead and top of the head, and once
</p>
<p>on the left hand, with what I supposed to be a bottle or decanter
</p>
<p>that he had seized from the table. During this time, he repeated, in
</p>
<p>an intense but not strong voice, tbe words, " I'm mad, I'm mad ! "
</p>
<p>On reaching the hall, he gave a sudden turn, and sprang away from
</p>
<p>me, and disappeared down stairs. While in the vicinity of tbe door
</p>
<p>of my father's room, as I was pushing him out, when he came oppo-
</p>
<p>site where tbe light of the hall shone on him, I saw by the light in
</p>
<p>tbe ball that he was a very large man, dark straight hair, smooth
</p>
<p>face, no beard ; and I bad a view of the expression of bis counte-

</p>
<p>nance,  a short view, of course. I then went into my room, and got
</p>
<p>my pistol. It may possibly have taken me a minute, as it was in
</p>
<p>the bottom of my carpet-bag, to find it. I then ran down to the
</p>
<p>front door, intending to shoot the person if he attempted to return.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 7
</p>
<p>While standing at the door, the servant-boj came back, and said the
</p>
<p>man had ridden off on a horse, and attacked the persons in the
</p>
<p>house with a knife. I then realized for the first time that the man
</p>
<p>was an assassin who had entered the house for the purpose of mur-
</p>
<p>dering my father.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you then return to your father's room ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose it was five minutes before I went back to my
</p>
<p>father's room. Quite a large crowd came around the door. I sent
</p>
<p>for the doctors, and got somebody to keep the crowd off before I
</p>
<p>went up to the room. It might not have been five minutes, but
</p>
<p>certainly three, before I got back : I think, nearer five.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine, on your return, the number and character
</p>
<p>of the wounds given to your father, and to your brother, Frederick W.
</p>
<p>Seward ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not examine them that night. I was injured
</p>
<p>pretty badly myself, I found, when I got up stairs again. I had a
</p>
<p>handkerchief tied around my head. After my father's wounds were
</p>
<p>dressed, I suppose about an hour, and after my own head had been
</p>
<p>bandaged, I went in and saw my father then, and saw that he had
</p>
<p>one very large gash on his right cheek, near the neck, besides a cut
</p>
<p>on his throat on the right-hand side, and one under the left ear. I
</p>
<p>did not examine my brother's wounds : in foot, I went into his room
</p>
<p>but for a short time that night. I did not know how badly hurt he
</p>
<p>was. The next day he was insensible, and so remained ; and it
</p>
<p>was four or five days before I saw what his wounds were.
</p>
<p>Q. What were they when you discovered them ?
</p>
<p>A. Two wounds,  one on the scalp, that was open to the brain ;
</p>
<p>and another one over the ear. After they took the pieces of frac-
</p>
<p>tured skull out, it left the covering of the brain open.
</p>
<p>Q. Did your brother receive any stab from a knife ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw any thing of my brother during the whole time
</p>
<p>until it was over.
</p>
<p>Q. Would the wounds indicate that a knife had been used, or

</p>
<p>simply a bludgeon ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell ; but the surgeons seemed to think it was the
</p>
<p>hammer of a pistol that had done it. It was such a wound that I
</p>
<p>8 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>should have supposed myself could have been made by a knife ; but
</p>
<p>they seemed to judge it was made by the hammer of a pistol.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the pistol which was picked up in the room ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see it. I knew it was in the house ; but it was
</p>
<p>taken away.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any article of clothing ?
</p>
<p>A. .1 saw the hat.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you recognize it ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I should.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the hat which is marked Exhibit
</p>
<p>No. 49.] Is that it ?
</p>
<p>A. I am quite certain that is the hat.
</p>
<p>Q. That was picked up in the room after the man left ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su' : I saw the hat in the room. It was picked up, and
</p>
<p>put in a bureau-drawer ; and it was taken out of the bureau-drawer
</p>
<p>and shown to me the next day. I did not see it that night.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you supposed he was striking with a decanter ?
</p>
<p>A. At that time, I supposed it was the nurse. I did not have
</p>
<p>any idea of what the man was at until he was out of the house. It
</p>
<p>was something that he cut with ; but, not having any idea that it was
</p>
<p>a man with a knife, I did not think any thing about it.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that it was with a knife you were
</p>
<p>struck ?
</p>
<p>A. The surgeons think so ; and I supposed so myself, after the
</p>
<p>boy told me who the man was, and what he had been doing : but, at
</p>
<p>the time, I supposed I was being struck by a bottle or decanter. I
</p>
<p>supposed it was the nurse had got delirious sitting up there, did not
</p>
<p>know what he was about, and was probably striking about the room
</p>
<p>at any one.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you feel entirely satisfied that the prisoner at the bar,
</p>
<p>Payne, is the same man who was there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.

<p>Q. Be good enough to state to the Court whether this is the first
</p>
<p>time you have seen the prisoner since the evening you have de-
</p>
<p>scribed.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 9
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I saw him on board the monitor the next day after
</p>
<p>he was taken.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you identify him then ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Please state the circumstances of the identification.
</p>
<p>A. He was brought up on the deck of the monitor ; and I took
</p>
<p>hold of him the same way I had hold of him when I shoved him out
</p>
<p>of the room ; and I looked at his face, and he had the same appear-
</p>
<p>ance in every way that he had the few moments that I saw him by
</p>
<p>the light in the hall,  his size, his proportions, smooth face, no
</p>
<p>beard ; and when he was made to repeat the words, " I'm mad, I'm
</p>
<p>mad ! " I recognized the same voice, varying only in the intensity.
</p>
<p>R. C. Morgan,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, on the 17th or 18th of April last, you
</p>
<p>were in the service of the Government here, and in what capacity.
</p>
<p>A. I was in the service of the War Department, acting under
</p>
<p>the orders of Colonel Olcott, special commissioner of that depart-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>Q. "Will you state whether, on one or both those days, you had
</p>
<p>possession of the house of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt, in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State where that house is.
</p>
<p>A. 541 H Street, "in Washington City.
</p>
<p>Q. State under what circumstances you took possession of the
</p>
<p>house, and what occurred while you were there.
</p>
<p>A. About twenty minutes past eleven o'clock on the evening of
</p>
<p>the 17th of April, Colonel Olcott gave me instructions to go to the
</p>
<p>house, 541 H Street, Mrs. Surratt's, and superintend the seizing of
</p>
<p>papers and the arrest of the inmates of the house. I proceeded

<p>and some other ofiicers, who had arrested the inmates of the house ;
</p>
<p>10 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>and tbey were in tbe parlor ; they were about ready to go up. I
</p>
<p>Lad sent out an order for a can-iage to take up tbe women found in
</p>
<p>tbe bouse ; and I beard a knock and a ring at tbe door : at tbe same
</p>
<p>time, Captain Wermcrskireb and myself stepped foi-ward, and opened
</p>
<p>tbe door. Allien we opened tbe door, tbe prisoner Payne [point-
</p>
<p>ing to Lewis Payne] came in with a pickaxe over bis shoulder,
</p>
<p>dressed in a gray coat, gray vest, black pants, and a bat made out
</p>
<p>of, I should judge, tbe sleeve of a shirt or tbe leg of a drawer. As
</p>
<p>soon as be came in, I immediately closed the door. Said be, "I
</p>
<p>guess I am mistaken." Said I, " Whom do you want to see ? "
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Surratt," said he. " You are right : walk in." He took a
</p>
<p>seat ; and I asked him what he came there at this time of night for.
</p>
<p>He said he came to dio; a e^utter : Mrs. Surratt had sent for him. I
</p>
<p>asked him when. He said, " In the morning." I asked him when
</p>
<p>she had sent for him ; where be last worked. He said, " Sometimes
</p>
<p>on I Street." I asked him where he boarded. He said be
</p>
<p>bad no boarding-house ; be was a poor man, who got bis living
</p>
<p>with the pick. I put my hand on tbe pickaxe while talking to him.
</p>
<p>Said I, " How much do you make a day? "  " Sometimes nothing
</p>
<p>at all, sometimes a dollar, sometimes a dollar and a half." Said I,
</p>
<p>*' Have you any money ? "  " Not a cent." I asked him why be
</p>
<p>came at this time of night to go to work. He said be simply called
</p>
<p>to find what time be should go to work in tbe morning. I asked
</p>
<p>him if he bad any previous acquaintance with Mrs. Surratt. He
</p>
<p>said, " No." Then I asked him why she had selected him. He said
</p>
<p>she knew he was working around tbe neighborhood and was a poor
</p>
<p>man, and came to him. 'I asked him bow old be was. He said,
</p>
<p>" About twenty." I asked him where be was from. He said be
</p>
<p>was from Fauquier County, Ya. Previous to this, be pulled
</p>
<p>out an oath of allegiance ; and on tbe oath of allegiance was " Lew-
</p>
<p>is Payne, Fauquier County, Ya." I asked him if he was from
</p>
<p>the South. He said be was. I asked him when he left there.

<p>of February. I think he said. I asked him what be left for. He
</p>
<p>said he would have to go into the army ; and be preferred earning
</p>
<p>bis Hving by the pickaxe. I asked him if he could read. He
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 11
</p>
<p>said, " No." I asked him if he could write. He said, " He could
</p>
<p>manaoe to write his name."
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the pickaxe which he had on his shoulder ? [Sub-
</p>
<p>mitting a pickaxe to the witness.]
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>[The pickaxe was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>I then told him he would have to go up to the Provost Marshal's
</p>
<p>office, and explain. He moved at that, and did not answer. The
</p>
<p>carriao^e had returned then that had taken off the women ; and I or-
</p>
<p>dered Thomas Samson and Mr. Rosch to take him up to the Provost
</p>
<p>Marshal's office. He was taken up by these two officers, and then
</p>
<p>searched. I then proceeded, with Major Smith and Captain Wer-
</p>
<p>merskirch, to search through the house for papers ; and remained
</p>
<p>there until three o'clock in the morning, searching for papers.
</p>
<p>Q. Had Mrs. Surratt left before he came in, or afterwards ?
</p>
<p>A. No : they were all prepared to leave, in the parlor. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt was directed to get the bonnets and shawls of the rest of the
</p>
<p>persons in the house, so that they could not communicate with each
</p>
<p>other. She did so ; and they were just ready to go, and had started,
</p>
<p>as we opened the door, and heard the knock ; and we passed them
</p>
<p>out at the time we let him within. He just got in before they
</p>
<p>stepped out.
</p>
<p>Q. She did not see him, then, before she left ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : she must have seen him as she passed out ; for, just
</p>
<p>as she was passing out, he passed right in.
</p>
<p>Q. You had no conversation with her in regard to him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what papers you found there ?
</p>
<p>A. We found several letters.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that Mrs. Surratt was not in his
</p>
<p>presence in the house ?
</p>
<p>A. No more than passing out : she must have seen him.
</p>
<p>Q. No conversation occm-red ?

<p>Examine these papers, and state whether they ai-e what you found
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>12 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I found them all in the house of IMrs. Surratt,
</p>
<p>541 H Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find there the photograph of J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The next morning, I went down to the house ; and
</p>
<p>the officer in charge, who had been sent down at four o'clock,
</p>
<p>showed me the photograph of J. Wilkes Booth, with his name on
</p>
<p>the back of it ; and the officer said he had found it behind a pic-
</p>
<p>ture in the house. I told him he should turn it over at once to the
</p>
<p>Provost Marshal ; and he did so. I found a carte de visite of Jef-
</p>
<p>ferson Davis, Beauregard, Alexander H. Stephens, and Beauregard
</p>
<p>again, in the house. These are in the envelope now shown to me.
</p>
<p>[The contents of the envelope were offered in evidence without
</p>
<p>objection ; being two photographs of General Beauregard, one of
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, one of Alexander H. StejDhens, and also a card
</p>
<p>with the arms of the State of Virginia, and two Confederate flags
</p>
<p>emblazoned thereon, with the inscription, 
</p>
<p>" Thus will it ever be with tyrants;
</p>
<p>Virginia the mighty;
</p>
<p>Sic Semper Tyrannis.^^l
</p>
<p>Q. Give the full name of the man who found the photograph of
</p>
<p>Booth.
</p>
<p>A. I think his name was Lieutenant Dempsey.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you not afterwards at the Provost Marshal's office?
</p>
<p>A. About three o'clock in the morning, we got through our
</p>
<p>search ; and I went up with the papers to the Provost Marshal's
</p>
<p>office, and there saw the prisoner Payne in irons.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Mrs. Surratt, the prisoner, there ?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Surratt had been taken up to the old Capitol, I think,
</p>
<p>before my arrival.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you heard Mrs. Surratt say any thing in regard to the
</p>
<p>prisoner Payne at any time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sii\

</p>
<p>heard her mutter something. I did not know what it was : the

</p>
<p>a laborer ; that lie came there to dig a gutter at the request of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt. I stepped to the door of the parlor, and said, " Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, will you step here a minute?" jMts. Surratt stepped
</p>
<p>there. Said I, "Do you know this man?" She said, raising
</p>
<p>her right hand, " Before Grod, sir, I do not know this man ; and I
</p>
<p>have never seen him." I then placed Payne under arrest, and
</p>
<p>told him he was so suspicious a character, that I would send him to
</p>
<p>Colonel Wells's or General Augur's headquarters for further exami-
</p>
<p>nation.
</p>
<p>Q. He was standing in full view of her when she said so?

<p>A. A larsre number of them.
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>Q. What were they?

</p>
<p>Q. Are you aware or not that it is a very common thing for
</p>

<p>cast for sale over the country ?
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever learned any thing of the contents of that
</p>
<p>bag?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not.
</p>
<p>Q. What was transpiring in the house at the time Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>\ THE TRIAL. 17
</p>
<p>made the asseveration to wliicli you refer in regard to her knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. The man Payne had just come in at the front door ; and I
</p>
<p>was questioning him at the time in regard to what he was ; what his
</p>
<p>profession was, if he had any ; and what business he had, at that
</p>
<p>hour of the night, to come to a private house.
</p>
<p>Q. How was Payne dressed at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Payne was dressed in a gray coat, black pantaloons, and
</p>
<p>rather a fine pair of boots. He had on his head a gray shirt-sleeve,
</p>
<p>hanging over at the side.
</p>
<p>Q. A shirt-sleeve on his head ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : a cut shirt.
</p>
<p>Q. Were his pantaloons tucked into his boots ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : they were rolled up over the tops of them, on one
</p>
<p>leg only, I beUeve.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not strike you at that time as being a gentleman
</p>
<p>from his looks and appearance ?
</p>
<p>A. Not particularly so.
</p>
<p>Q. His appearance was in no wise genteel ?
</p>
<p>A. Not at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it your opinion that any one would recognize a person in
</p>
<p>that garb, in that dress, who had seen him, if he ever did see
</p>
<p>him, well dressed, with such a thing as that on his head?
</p>
<p>A. That, to the best of my belief, was the thing, the sleeve he
</p>
<p>had on his head at the time he was arrested, the end similar to a
</p>
<p>tassel.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize a person fixed up in that
</p>
<p>way, with that shirt-sleeve on his head, and a pickaxe ?
</p>
<p>A. I most certainly should.
</p>
<p>Q. A person you had been in the habit of seeing dressed
</p>
<p>genteelly ?
</p>
<p>A. Certainly.
</p>

<p>about leaving the house ?
</p>
<p>, A. I made none when I was leaving the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say any thing about being ready ?
</p>
<p>A. I said nothing at all. I told her to get ready.
</p>
<p>2*
</p>
<p>18 THE THIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliat was her attitude at that time?
</p>
<p>A. At which particular time do you mean?
</p>
<p>Q. At the time you told her to get ready ; you were going.
</p>
<p>A. She was seated in a chair in the front parlor.
</p>
<p>Q. Was she not kneeling ?
</p>
<p>A. She was not.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was present with you at the time this asseveration was
</p>
<p>made that she knew nothing of that man ?
</p>
<p>A. Captain Wermerskirch and ]Mr. Morgan, two of my subordi-
</p>
<p>nates in the party.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that all the remark she made about Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. That was all the remark she made in my hearing.
</p>
<p>Q. Now, once more, do not you know that it is a common thing
</p>
<p>for loyal people to have in their possession photographs of the leaders
</p>
<p>of the Eebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I know some that have those pictures.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of a photograph of J. Wilkes Booth having
</p>
<p>been found in that house ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. There was none found while I was there.
</p>
<p>Q. When you called to Mrs. Surratt to come and look at Payne,
</p>
<p>who had just entered the house, you say she was seated in the
</p>
<p>parlor ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ask her directly whether she knew this man, or had
</p>
<p>seen him before ?
</p>
<p>A. I did immediately. I said, " Mrs. Surratt, will you please
</p>
<p>step to the door?" She stepped to the door ; and I said, " Do you
</p>
<p>know this man ? and did you hire him to come and dig a gutter for
</p>

</p>
<p>" Before God, I do not know this man, and have never seen him,

<p>and did not hire him to dig a gutter for me."

<p>THE TRIAL. 19
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : her answer was direct.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it light in the hall at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : very light. The gas was turned on at full head.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. How was he dressed at that time?
</p>
<p>A. A gray coat and black pantaloons. I did not see the vest.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the brown and white mixed coat
</p>
<p>marked Exhibit No. 54.] Is that the coat he had on ?
</p>
<p>A. That is the coat, to the best of my beUef.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Clampitt :
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mrs. SuiTatt express any sui'prise or deep feeling at the
</p>
<p>moment of her arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : she did not ask even for what she was arrested ;
</p>
<p>expressed no surprise and no feeling at all.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. How many persons were arrested together?
</p>
<p>A. Four persons were aiTested at once,  3Ii's. SuiTatt, Miss
</p>
<p>Surratt, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and Miss Jenkins.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there an inquiry made at all of you as to the cause of
</p>
<p>the aiTest?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : none whatever. When I went up the steps, and
</p>
<p>rang the bell of the house, Mrs. Surratt came to the window, and
</p>
<p>said, " Is that you, Mr. Kirby ? " The reply was, that it was not
</p>
<p>Mr. Kirby, and to open the door. She opened the door ; and I
</p>
<p>stepped into the hall, and asked, " Are you Mrs. Surratt? " She
</p>
<p>said, " I am, the widow of John H. Surratt ; " and I added, " The
</p>
<p>mother of Jolm H. Surratt, jun. ? " She said, "I am." I said,
</p>
<p>"I come to arrest you and all in your house, and take you, for
</p>
<p>examination, to General Augur's headquarters."
</p>
<p>Q. That occurred immediately on your entering the house ?
</p>
<p>A. Immediately on my stepping into the front door.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that coat to be the one Payne had on ?

<p>A. How would you know any thing you had seen before but
</p>
<p>from memory?
</p>
<p>20 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. I am simply asking you how do you know ?
</p>
<p>A. By the way anybody would recognize a thing after having
</p>
<p>seen it once,  by the impression that was made on the memory at
</p>
<p>the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Are there any particular marks about this coat that make it
</p>
<p>look like the one you saw ?
</p>
<p>A. The color and the general look of the coat.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure that the coat he had on was not what is called
</p>
<p>Confederate gray ?
</p>
<p>A. I am veiy certain, as I have said before, that this is the
</p>
<p>coat.
</p>
<p>Q. You are, then, certain that it was not Confederate gray ?
</p>
<p>A. I have said before, that I am certain that this is the coat.
</p>
<p>Q. Answer my question. I do not ask what you said before :
</p>
<p>I want an answer to the question I now ask.
</p>
<p>A. I think I have already testified on that point. I do not
</p>
<p>know that I am called on to repeat more than three or four times.
</p>
<p>Q. It is only necessary for you to answer that simple question,
</p>
<p>whether you are certain the coat the prisoner had on at that time
</p>
<p>was not what is generally called Confederate gray?
</p>
<p>A. As near as I could judge by the light that was in the hall at
</p>
<p>the time, this was the coat.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness a dark-gray coat.] Select now,
</p>
<p>between this coat and the one you have just had in your hands,
</p>
<p>which is the nearest the color.
</p>
<p>A. The coat now shown me is the one. [The dark-gray coat
</p>
<p>was offered in evidence without objection.] I recognize the coat
</p>
<p>by the buttons. All that was wanted in the other coat was the
</p>
<p>buttons ; but it was hard, in the light in which I was standing, to
</p>
<p>tell. I recognize now, by the buttons, that the coat just shown me
</p>
<p>is the one.

<p>Q. If you saw a gentleman dressed in black, with a white neck-
</p>
<p>cloth on him, presenting himself to you as a Baptist preacher, and,
</p>
<p>two months after that, you should meet the same person with a shii't-

<p>sleeve on his head, an old gray coat, his pantaloons stuffed into his
</p>
<p>boots, with a pickaxe on his shoulder, presenting himself as a laborer
</p>
<p>in the night, do you think you would immediately recognize him as
</p>
<p>being the same person ?
</p>
<p>A. If I was very familiar with his countenance, I should.
</p>
<p>Q. You would recollect all that, and yet you could not recollect
</p>
<p>a coat that you had only seen within a short time, but confounded
</p>
<p>it with one that was as different in appearance as those two coats
</p>
<p>here?
</p>
<p>A. It is hard to remember the particular color of a coat, as any
</p>
<p>one will very weU know, that you see at night-time, if they saw it
</p>
<p>by gas-light.
</p>
<p>Surgeon-General Joseph K. Barnes,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not, on the night of
</p>
<p>the 14th of April last, you were called to see Mr. Seward, the
</p>
<p>Secretary of State, in this city, and in what condition you found
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. I was called upon on the night of the 14th of April, a few
</p>
<p>minutes before eleven o'clock, to go to the ^Secretary of State's.
</p>
<p>Upon reaching there, I found the Secretary wounded in three
</p>
<p>places ; Mr. Frederick W. Seward insensible, and very badly
</p>
<p>wounded in the head. The rest of the family I did not see, as I
</p>
<p>was occupied with them.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe the wounds of each of those gentlemen ?
</p>
<p>A. The Secretary was wounded by a gash in the right cheek,
</p>
<p>passing around to the angle of the jaw ; by a stab in the right neck,
</p>
<p>passing into the body of this muscle [pointing out a muscle] ;
</p>
<p>by a stab in the right side of the neck, passing in at the same
</p>
<p>muscle.
</p>
<p>. Q. The wounds of Frederick Seward, his son ?

</p>
<p>A. Mr. Frederick Seward was suffering from a fracture of the
</p>
<p>cranium in two places, bleeding very profusely, exceedingly faint,
</p>
<p>almost pulseless, and unable to articulate.
</p>
<p>22 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. How did the wounds seem to have been mflicted on his
</p>
<p>head?
</p>
<p>A. By some blunt instrument,  the butt of a pistol, a loaded
</p>
<p>bludgeon, or something of that kind.
</p>
<p>Q, What was the condition of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, before that ? You were in attendance upon him, were you
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. He was progressing very favorably. He had recovered from
</p>
<p>the shock of the accident of ten days previously, and was getting
</p>
<p>along very well.
</p>
<p>Q. Had his limb been broken ?
</p>
<p>A. His right arm was broken close to the shoulder-joint, and his
</p>
<p>jaw was broken in two places ; but the serious injury of the first
</p>
<p>accident was the concussion.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether a pistol was picked up in the chamber
</p>
<p>of Mr. Seward that night ?
</p>
<p>A. Not while I was there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see one afterwards that was picked up ?
</p>
<p>A. I never have seen the pistol.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the wounds of Mr. Secretary Seward very dangerous
</p>
<p>in their character ?
</p>
<p>A. Very dangerous.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he still sneering from them ?
</p>
<p>A. He is still suffering from them.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you did not see any other member of the family,
</p>
<p>except Mr. Seward and his son ?
</p>
<p>A. Major Seward was in the room ; but I did not treat him
</p>
<p>professionally.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you treat professionally any of the others ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, soon after the night of the murder of
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 23
</p>
<p>the President, you picked up, somewhere in the neighborhood of this
</p>
<p>city, a coat ?
</p>
<p>A. On the afternoon of Sunday, the 16th of April.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you pick it up ?
</p>
<p>A. In a piece of woods that lies between Fort Bunker Hill and
</p>
<p>Fort Saratoga.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you recognize that coat again if you were to see it ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I should.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness two coats.] Look at these two
</p>
<p>coats, and see if either of them is the one.
</p>
<p>A. This is the coat [selecting the brown and white mixed
</p>
<p>coat].
</p>
<p>Q. Did you discover any trace of blood on the sleeve ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Show it to the Court.
</p>
<p>The witness pointed out blood-marks on the right sleeve of the
</p>
<p>coat.
</p>
<p>Q. How far from the city is that piece of woods that you speak
</p>
<p>of where you picked it up ?
</p>
<p>A. About three miles.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction ?
</p>
<p>A. East of the Eastern Branch.
</p>
<p>Q. Pn any road ?
</p>
<p>A. There is a road from one fort to another, and it runs through
</p>
<p>this piece of woods. On the eastern side of this road, in this piece
</p>
<p>of woods, I found the coat.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the blood on it when you found it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is how I recognize it more particularly.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. When did you find that coat? State the exact time you
</p>
<p>found it.
</p>
<p>A. About three o'clock on Sunday, the 16th of April.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it lying in the road, or not ?

</p>
<p>A. I should think it was a road that was made by hauling out
</p>
<p>wood ; and the grass had grown over it : it was a by-road that was
</p>
<p>not used. There were no tracks of wheels ; but I think it was the

</p>
<p>formation of a road througli those woods ; and, on tlie turn in the
</p>
<p>road, I got the coat.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction is that from Washington City ?
</p>
<p>A. A valley runs from the direction of Harewood Hospital out
</p>
<p>between Fort Bunker Hill and Fort Saratoga ; and this strip of
</p>
<p>woods lies between these two foiis, in the valley.
</p>
<p>Q. It is north-east, then ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : north-east of the city.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. You said it was on the east side of the Eastern Branch that
</p>
<p>you found the coat : was it not on this side of the Branch ?
</p>
<p>A. I understand the Branch to run east from Washington : it
</p>
<p>was east of that, on this side of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not on this side, instead of the east side ?
</p>
<p>A. On this side.

</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner Payne was searched ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness a package of articles.] Look at
</p>
<p>those articles, and state whether all or any of them were found upon
</p>
<p>his person.
</p>
<p>A. They all were.
</p>
<p>Q. Is there not among them a pocket-compass ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that taken from his person ?
</p>
<p>A. That was handed out by the prisoner himself to Mr. Samson,
</p>
<p>and from Samson to me.
</p>
<p>Q. What pnsoner ?
</p>
<p>A. That big man there [pointing to Lewis Payne]. All these
</p>
<p>articles were taken from his person.

<p>THE TRIAL. 25
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness a pair of boots.] Do you recog-
</p>
<p>nize these boots as the same that were taken from him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : I recognize these boots. I had them pulled off in my
</p>
<p>presence.
</p>
<p>[The boots were offered in evidence.]
</p>
<p>His feet were incased in a very clean pair of socks, with bands
</p>
<p>tied up on the sides something like the Highland fashion.
</p>
<p>Spencer M. Clark,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the boots.] Look at these boots,
</p>
<p>and state if you can discover any name written on them.
</p>
<p>A. I had one of these boots yesterday for examination ; and I
</p>
<p>could then discover a name which has now mostly disappeared under
</p>
<p>the effect of the acid that I put upon it.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what the name was ?
</p>
<p>A. The name appeared to me to be J. W. Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did it appear with entire distinctness ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : both the J. and the W. were distinct ; the rest
</p>
<p>was obscure.
</p>
<p>Q. Did it seem to have been effaced ? and how ?
</p>
<p>A. When I first received it, it was simply a black mark, evident-
</p>
<p>ly a mark of ink, made over the surface, apparently to cover writ-
</p>
<p>ing. I first examined it by a microscope, and found that it was
</p>
<p>one coat of ink overlaid over another ; and then I attempted to take
</p>
<p>off the outer coat, and see what was below it. I succeeded par-
</p>
<p>tially.
</p>
<p>Q. You say the letters "J. W." were entirely distinct. Were
</p>
<p>the other letters so obscure as to leave any doubt in your mind as to
</p>
<p>what the name was ?
</p>
<p>A. Very little doubt. I cannot speak positively of a thing that
</p>
<p>is in itself obscure ; but it left very little doubt upon my mind that

<p>the name was Booth.
</p>
<p>VOL. n. 3
</p>
<p>26 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Cross-exam inecl by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. What is your business ?
</p>
<p>A. I have charge of the engraving and printing in the Treasury.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that you had some doubt as to that
</p>
<p>name being Booth.
</p>
<p>A. I had some little doubt at first as to the " B," whether it
</p>
<p>might not be a " P; " the lower part of the " B " being not as plain
</p>
<p>as the other part : but, on very careful examination, I satisfied my-
</p>
<p>self that it was a "B."
</p>
<p>Q. What processes have you used to bring out the name of
</p>
<p>Booth?
</p>
<p>A. I took off the outer coat of ink by the use of oxalic acid.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it possible, by means of chemistry, to take off the outer
</p>
<p>coat, and leave the lower or inner coat undisturbed ?
</p>
<p>A. Where the lower coat has remained exposed to the air longer
</p>
<p>, than the upper coat, it is. The reason the latter part of the name
</p>
<p>in this case is more obscure than the first is because I left the acid
</p>
<p>too long on the outer coat, and it attacked the lower one.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you separate the lower and upper coats ?
</p>
<p>A. By washing, as fast as I dissolve the acid, with plain water.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it clear to your mind where the lower coat ends and the
</p>
<p>upper begins ?
</p>
<p>A. It is only made clear by examination by the eye at the mo-
</p>
<p>ment. I put the acid on under a magnifier ; and the moment the
</p>
<p>outer coat disappears, and the next begins to show, I then destroy
</p>
<p>the acid.
</p>
<p>Q. You can, then, distinguish whether the two coats have been
</p>
<p>put on at the same time, or at different times, can you?
</p>
<p>A. After trial. It was supposition before I tried. I supposed
</p>
<p>the lower coat had been exposed to the air longer than the outer,
</p>
<p>and made that trial to test it. That proved it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any idea what the pui'pose was of giving this
</p>
<p>boot to you for analysis ?

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who gave it to you ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Field, the Second Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>Q. Did be tell you to whom the boot was supposed to belong ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 27
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And who had worn it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did he say had worn it ?
</p>
<p>A. Payne.
</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Field said so ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You had, then, an impression that it was your duty to discover
</p>
<p>some name ; had you not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; if it was there.
</p>
<p>Q. And some one in connection with this case ?
</p>
<p>A. I expected to find the name of Payne.
</p>
<p>Q. And, not finding that, you naturally expected to find the
</p>
<p>name of somebody else connected with this case ?
</p>
<p>A. I then followed out the letters until I thought I plainly dis-
</p>
<p>covered " th " at the end ; and then the name of Booth came to my
</p>
<p>mind. That was before I had clearly determined upon the B,
</p>
<p>Q. Is it possible, by any process of chemistry, to restore that
</p>
<p>name ? You say you have erased it.
</p>
<p>A. There is no such process that I am aware of.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it necessary for you to erase it in order to arrive at your
</p>
<p>conclusion ?
</p>
<p>A. It is not erased : there is no erasure upon the letters. The
</p>
<p>writing has only been acted upon by the acid, which changes its
</p>
<p>color,  destroys the color of its ink.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it readable still?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The acid has acted on the lower coat ; the J. and
</p>
<p>W. are still readable.
</p>
<p>Q. But you think, taking it altogether, that there is still a rea-
</p>
<p>sonable doubt as to that being the name of J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I should hesitate to swear to any thing so obscure as an oblit-
</p>
<p>erated signature. I entertain very little doubt that the name is J.
</p>
<p>W. Booth ; but I cannot swear positively to such a thing.

<p>A. I was only requested to look at the boot after it had under-
</p>
<p>gone whatever chemical preparation it had been subjected to.
</p>
<p>Q. State the result of your examination.
</p>
<p>A. I looked at the marks on the boot ; and I came to the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that the name written there was "J. W. Booth."
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine it through a glass ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir,
</p>
<p>Q. How are you engaged here ?
</p>
<p>A. I am Solicitor of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know who the person was to whom it was supposed
</p>
<p>to belong ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not know whom it came from ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it in the possession of Mr. Clark when you had it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any suspicions as to why he had it in his
</p>
<p>possession ?
</p>
<p>A. None in the world.
</p>
<p>Q. How came you to see it ?
</p>
<p>A. The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury called -me, appar-
</p>
<p>ently accidently, as I was passing the door of the room in which
</p>
<p>Mr. Clark was, and said, " I have something curious to show you ;
</p>
<p>I wish you would look at it ; " or words to that ejQfect.
</p>
<p>Q. What day was that ?
</p>
<p>A. Yesterday.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the name distinctly legible ?

</p>
<p>A. I do not think it was.
</p>
<p>Q. How distinct was it ?
</p>
<p>A. A part of the name was quite distinct.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 29
</p>
<p>Q. What part?
</p>
<p>A. The first letter, " J.," was very distinct ; the middle letter,
</p>
<p>** W.," was not so distinct; the third initial was still less distinct in
</p>
<p>outline, but I thought quite as clear in its character. I do not mean
</p>
<p>to say as clear as the " J. : " that was the most distinct letter upon
</p>
<p>the article.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the letters after " B " in the name clear?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The first letter I thought was quite clear. I do
</p>
<p>not mean to say that it was a distinct letter,  there were none of
</p>
<p>those letters distinct ; but it was sufficiently so, I thought, to indi-
</p>
<p>cate very satisfactorily what it was. I thought the outline was quite
</p>
<p>visible and determinable ; but that it was distinct is not true.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you asked what you thought that name was ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you say ?
</p>
<p>A. I said I thought it was the name of a very distinguished
</p>
<p>individual.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that all you said ?
</p>
<p>A. That is all I said then.
</p>
<p>Q. Is Mr. Clark in the habit of receiving boots or other matters
</p>
<p>in reference to criminal trials ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. So, whenever you saw a boot there, you would naturally infer
</p>
<p>that it had some reference to a criminal trial ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I did not infer that until I came to a conclusion as to
</p>
<p>what the name was : then I did, of course.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to state that you arrived at the conclusion
</p>
<p>that this was the name, J. W. Booth, before you had received any
</p>
<p>intimation as to what it was supposed to be ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>By the Judge Advocate ;

</p>
<p>30 ' THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at that boot, and state to the Court whether you made
</p>
<p>an examination of it with a view to ascertain what name was written
</p>
<p>there, and what was the result of that examination.
</p>
<p>A. It was shown to me by Mr. Field, Assistant Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Treasury, yesterday. I examined it. I thought I could make out
</p>
<p>certain letters on it. M first, I could make out the letter " J " or
</p>
<p>" I ; " then " W.," and " h," the last letter ; then a capital '' B "
</p>
<p>after the " W."
</p>
<p>Q. Was that all you could make out ?
</p>
<p>A. That was all I could make out on the first examination.
</p>
<p>Then I thoui^ht I could trace " t " next to the ** h," the " J. W.
</p>
<p>B  th." That was all I could make out.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you make out the intervening letters ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not be satisfied as to them. The *' B " and " th " I
</p>
<p>am quite satisfied of.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine it through a glass ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir, I did not, but with the naked eye. There was a
</p>
<p>glass there ; but I did not look through it.
</p>
<p> Q. In regard to the letters you have mentioned, you say you
</p>
<p>had no doubt?
</p>
<p>A. No doubt at all.
</p>
<p>Q. In the intervening space, the blank space, was there room for
</p>
<p>one or two letters between " B " and " th " ?
</p>
<p>A. There was room for from two to three letters. It would
</p>
<p>depend altogether on how they were written,  a space of nearly
</p>
<p>half an inch.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. How did you happen to see that boot ?
</p>
<p>A. It was handed to me by Mr. Field, Assistant Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Treasury, in his room.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen the boot before ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. What were you told ? Was any thing said to you about the

</p>
<p>boot before it was handed to you ?
</p>
<p>A. I was told to examine it, and see if I could make out what
</p>
<p>name appeared to be written there.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 31
</p>
<p>Q. Are you prepared to say that name was not John H. Boole ?
</p>
<p>A. I can swear it was not : I would not be positive, but I am
</p>
<p>almost positive, that the last two letters are " th." That is what I
</p>
<p>make it out to be.
</p>
<p>Q, And you cannot swear that it read " J. W. Booth " ?
</p>
<p>A. I would not like to swear as to the two intervening letters.
</p>
<p>Q. After you had seen the boot, what did you say ?
</p>
<p>A. I said I could make out the "J. W. h; " then after-
</p>
<p>wards "B" and "t."
</p>
<p>Q. That is all you said ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>William H, Bell
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By direction of the Judge Advocate, the handcuffs were removed
</p>
<p>from the prisoner Lewis Payne, and he was directed to array him-
</p>
<p>self in the coats and hat previously identified. He accordingly put
</p>
<p>on the dark-gray coat, marked Exhibit No. 55, and over it the
</p>
<p>brown and white mixed coat, marked Exhibit No. 54, buttoned
</p>
<p>as an overcoat, and the hat, marked Exhibit No. 4 ; and he
</p>
<p>stood erect in this position.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I wish this witness, who has been
</p>
<p>recalled for the purpose of seeing the prisoner Payne in this dress,
</p>
<p>to look at him now, and see whether he recognizes him.
</p>
<p>The Witness. When he came in, he had on that coat and hat :
</p>
<p>he had on a white collar, and looked quite nice to what he looks
</p>
<p>now. That is the very same hat he had on : he had it bent down
</p>
<p>over one eye, one corner of it turned down. He had the same look
</p>
<p>he has now : he looked pretty fiery out of the eyes at me,  the
</p>
<p>same way he looks now.
</p>
<p>Sergeant George F. Bobinson
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.

<p>give your opinion whether he is the same man who came to Secre-
</p>
<p>tary Seward's on the night of the 16th of April last.
</p>
<p>32 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. He looks more natural now than he did before.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you give an opinion to the Court whether that is the
</p>
<p>same man ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think it was. I am not sure about it ; but I think
</p>
<p>it was.
</p>
<p>Q. I believe you did not state precisely the hour at which this
</p>
<p>stabbing occurred : will you state it now, if you can ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not far from ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it before, or after, do you think ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think it was after ten.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the pistol which was picked up there
</p>
<p>in the room, after he left, was loaded or not ?
</p>
<p>A. It was : I examined it.
</p>
<p>Jacob Eitterspaijgh,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Edward Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where he lived in Washington until he was
</p>
<p>arrested ?
</p>
<p>A. He boarded where I board.
</p>
<p>Q, Where was that ?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Scott's, on the comer of Seventh and G Streets.
</p>
<p>Q. Who an'ested him?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know : I was not there at the time he was arrested.
</p>
<p>Q. WTiat is the name of the house ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know : there is no number on the house.
</p>
<p>Q. "Who owns it?
</p>
<p>A. A Mr. Ford, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Does he live in it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : Mrs. Scott has it leased from Mr. Ford.
</p>
<p>Q. Who lives in the house?

</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Scott.
</p>
<p>Q. Who occupied the room with Spangler ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 33
</p>
<p>A. He never slept there : he just took his meals ; that was all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he have a room in the house?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he slept at the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the rope that was taken there?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I know he had a valise there ; he used to keep it
</p>
<p>there. I do not know whether any thing was in it or not. The
</p>
<p>detectives came in, and asked me if Spangler had any thing there,
</p>
<p>and I told them I did not know any more than the valise ; and I
</p>
<p>gave it to them, and they took it, and went off with it.
</p>
<p>Q. You know that that valise that you gave them was Span-
</p>
<p>gler 's valise ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know what it contained?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have never looked into it. They took it off.
</p>
<p>They asked me if he had any chests or trunks, and I told them no :
</p>
<p>he had no clothes there, nor any thing else.
</p>
<p>Q. When did he bring the ^lise there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you give it to the officers ?
</p>
<p>A. On Monday night, the 17th of April last. ,
</p>
<p>Q. Are you not commonly called " Jake " about the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. I am.
</p>
<p>Captain William M. Wermerskirch,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q, State to the Court whether or not, on the night of the 14th of
</p>
<p>April last, you were at the house of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt, in
</p>
<p>this city.
</p>
<p>A. I was, on the night of the 17th of April.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you present when she and the prisoner Payne met?
</p>
<p>A. I was present.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or did you not hear Major Smith address any re-

</p>
<p>mark to her, or make any inquiry of her, in regard to the prisoner
</p>
<p>Payne ?
</p>
<p>34 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. He asked Mrs. Surratt whether she knew Payne, the man
</p>
<p>who came there.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Mrs. Surratt then in the presence of Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. She saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. What was her reply?
</p>
<p>A. She held up either one or both hands,  I cannot say,  and
</p>
<p>said, " Before God, I have never seen that man before. I have not
</p>
<p>hired him ; I do not know any thing about him ; " or words to that
</p>
<p>effect.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recognize the prisoner Payne as the man of whom you
</p>
<p>speak ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : this one is him [pointing to Lewis Payne].
</p>
<p>Q. And the prisoner Mrs. Surratt is the woman of whom you
</p>
<p>speak ?
</p>
<p>A. She is.
</p>
<p>Cross-exammed by Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you make any search of the premises while you were there ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. What did jou find?
</p>
<p>A. I found a number of photographs, papers, a bullet-mould, and
</p>
<p>some percussion-caps.
</p>
<p>Q. In whose room were the percussion-caps found ?
</p>
<p>A. In the room of Mrs. Surratt : I think, at least, it was in her
</p>
<p>room. It was the back room on the lower floor. I also found there
</p>
<p>the bullet-mould.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the percussion-caps lying around loose in the room?
</p>
<p>A. They were, I think, in one of the drawers of the bureau. The
</p>
<p>bullet-mould was on the top of a wardrobe.
</p>
<p>Q. Was this room on the first floor of the house ?
</p>
<p>A. It was on the first floor,  the back room. It was the back
</p>
<p>parlor.
</p>
<p>Q. What were the photographs you found there ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a number there : but I do not know whose like-

</p>
<p>nesses they were ; at least, I cannot now remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find the photograph of Jefferson Davis and of Alexan-
</p>
<p>der H. Stephens ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 35
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; or, rather, they were not exactly photographs : I
</p>
<p>think they were lithographic cartes de visite, got up in the same shape
</p>
<p>that photographic cartes de visite are got up.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you aware that different booksellers and dealers expose
</p>
<p>these photographs for sale freely throughout the country ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen them in Baltimore for sale.
</p>
<p>Q. Even in Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think, eighteen months ago, I saw them there for
</p>
<p>sale, though they were prohibited to be sold by an order of the com-
</p>
<p>manding general at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not frequently seen photographs of the leaders of
</p>
<p>the Rebellion in the hands of persons supposed to be loyal ?
</p>
<p>A. Not frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. But you have seen them ?
</p>
<p>A. I may have seen them : I do not recollect having seen any.
</p>
<p>I do not recollect any particular instance. I mean to say, I have
</p>
<p>seen them.
</p>
<p>Q. You know it to be a common affair to have these photographs
</p>
<p>about freely through the country ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not know that.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever seen the photographs of Booth in the hands of
</p>
<p>persons supposed to be perfectly loyal ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen photographs of him in the hands of persons perfect-
</p>
<p>ly loyal, but only in the hands of those who took an interest in having
</p>
<p>him arrested.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you never saw any photograph of him before the assas-
</p>
<p>sination ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not to my knowledge at least.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it not a common thing for the photographs of eminent
</p>
<p>actors to be exposed for sale about ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it is.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it not common for people to have such photographs of
</p>
<p>eminent actors, actresses, and distinguished persons in their al-

<p>bums?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. It may be for all I know.
</p>
<p>Q. Whereabouts in the house were you when Mrs. Surratt made
</p>
<p>the asseveration to which you allude ?
</p>
<p>"36 THE TRIAL,
</p>
<p>A. I was standing in the hall, very near the front parlor, afford-
</p>
<p>ing me full view of the hall and the interior of the front parlor.
</p>
<p>Q. Was she in the parlor, or in the hall ?
</p>
<p>A. She was in the parlor, very near the hall-door ; or standing,
</p>
<p>perhaps, in the door.
</p>
<p>Q. Was she kneeling, or standing, at the time you told her you
</p>
<p>were ready to go ?
</p>
<p>A. I never told her so.
</p>
<p>Q. What remark did you make to her, if any, at the time you
</p>
<p>were ready to take the people from the house ?
</p>
<p>A. The remark was made by Major Smith, if I am not mistaken;
</p>
<p>not by me.
</p>
<p>Q. What did Major Smith say ?
</p>
<p>A. We had sent for a carriage to take her to the Provost Mar-
</p>
<p>shal's oflQce ; and he informed her that the carriage was there, and
</p>
<p>ready to take her. Her reply was, that she requested a minute or
</p>
<p>so to kneel down first to pray.
</p>
<p>Q. Then she did kneel and pray before she left the house ?
</p>
<p>A. She knelt down : whether she prayed or not, I cannot tell.
</p>
<p>Q. How was Payne dressed when he came in, or the person sup-
</p>
<p>posed to be Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. He was dressed in a very dark coat, pants that seemed to be
</p>
<p>black ; and he had a very close-fitting head-dress, seemingly appar-
</p>
<p>rently to be a shirt-sleeve or the lower part of a drawer, closely fitting
</p>
<p>around his head, and hanging down for about six or seven inches,
</p>
<p>perhaps.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting a sleeve of a woollen shu-t to the witness.] Is
</p>
<p>that it ?
</p>
<p>A. It looks something similar to it ; and I think it is what he
</p>
<p>wore on his head at the time.
</p>
<p>[The sleeve was offered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Were both legs of his pantaloons stuffed into his pants ?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know ; but I know he was full of mud up to

</p>
<p>his knees nearly.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you could recognize the coat he had on if you
</p>
<p>should see it now ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I could.
</p>
<p>^ THE TRIAL. 37
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recognize bira now?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I think the coat he had on then was not so long,
</p>
<p>and was darker than the one he has on now ; but I may be mistaken.
</p>
<p>[The prisoner Lewis Payne, by direction of the Judge Advocate,
</p>
<p>was then divested of the brown and white mixed coat, marked Ex-
</p>
<p>hibit No, 54, leaving upon him the dark gray coat, marked Exhibit
</p>
<p>No. 55 ; and the shirt-sleeve, marked Exhibit No. 53, was put on as
</p>
<p>a head-dress.] That is the way he had that head-dress on; and that,
</p>
<p>I think, is the coat he wore ; though I am not so sure in regard to
</p>
<p>that. The hall was not lit up very well : we had dimmed the gas-
</p>
<p>light purposely.
</p>
<p>Q. The hall was not well lit up ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not so well lit up where we were standing that I could
</p>
<p>positively swear that was the coat lie wore then : it is as near the
</p>
<p>color and shape of the coat as can be.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bixgham :
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the man ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is the man who entered the house about mid-
</p>
<p>niojht.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think, if you should see a person dressed genteelly in
</p>
<p>black clothes, with a white handkerchief about his neck, representing
</p>
<p>himself to you as a Baptist minister, you would, two or three weeks
</p>
<p>after that, recognize him in this garb, in dim gaslight, and covered
</p>
<p>with mud, as the same person ?
</p>
<p>A. I declare I do not know how Baptist ministers look.
</p>
<p>Q. What is your religious persuasion and belief ?
</p>
<p>A. 1 have been brought up as a Catholic.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would be able to recognize a person in such
</p>
<p>a garb in dim gaslight, when you had been in the habit of meeting
</p>
<p>the same person before genteelly dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. If I was asked to identify him, and look at him, and say if he was
</p>
<p>the same man or not, I think I would. The prisoner had not taken

</p>
<p>38 TEE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. You have not the least doubt In your mind but that you would
</p>
<p>be able to recognize a man in those different garbs under these cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I would recognize him, even if he put on another coat,
</p>
<p>and besmeared himself with mud.
</p>
<p>Q. Were any other remarks made to you by Mrs. Surratt in ref-
</p>
<p>erence to Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. Even the remark that I mentioned was not made to
</p>
<p>me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mrs. Surratt manifest any desire to avoid your questions
</p>
<p>at any time on the recognition of this man if she did know him ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not question her at any time at all. I only turned
</p>
<p>around when the question was asked.
</p>
<p>Q. I simply asked what your impression was of her manner.
</p>
<p>A. She did not seem to like it very well ; but, at the same time,
</p>
<p>she did not manifest much desire to evade it.
</p>
<p>Q. From where you were standing in the hall, could you see into
</p>
<p>the parlor ?
</p>
<p>A. I was standing at different parts of the hall. I was standing
</p>
<p>where I could not command a full view of the parlor ; and again I
</p>
<p>was at a point where I could see every thing that transpired in the
</p>
<p>parlor.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any thing of a black bag in that house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have seen it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it opened in your presence ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not. Our men had not the means of opening it : none
</p>
<p>of our keys fitted it ; and I had it sent up with the other things to
</p>
<p>the Provost Marshal's office to be opened there.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know positively, of your own knowledge, of any thing
</p>
<p>that was in it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 39
</p>
<p>A. As far as I remember, three albums containing photographs,
</p>
<p>and some loose photographs besides.
</p>
<p>Q. Were those photographs you speak of representations of the
</p>
<p>leaders of the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I think they represented Jeff. Pavis  I do not know him
</p>
<p>personally  and General Beauregard. Those are the only two I
</p>
<p>can remember now.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find photographs of Union generals there ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw a photograph of General McClellan there.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not consider him a Union general ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; he has been a general on our side : that is all I
</p>
<p>know.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever have the honor of serving under him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Clampitt :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember that he planned and fought the battle of
</p>
<p>Antietam ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! I recollect it.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a frame containing a photographic
</p>
<p>picture representing "Morning, Noon, and Night."] Do you rec-
</p>
<p>ollect finding this picture and frame in Mrs. Surratt's house ?
</p>
<p>A. This picture was in the Surratt house, on the lower flooor, if
</p>
<p>I am not mistaken, in the back room, standing on the mantle-piece.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine the picture under it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You simply found this picture ?
</p>
<p>A. I simply found it there, and left it there, because I did not
</p>
<p>think any thing of it.
</p>
<p>Q. You identify the frame as being there, and say that this pic-

<p>40 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that you found the bullet-mould in
</p>
<p>the top of the wardrobe in Mrs. Surratt's room ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, when Mrs. Surratt was look-
</p>
<p>ing at the prisoner Payne, there was a full head of gas there in the
</p>
<p>hall, where he was standing ?
</p>
<p>A. At the place where Payne was standing at the time, the spot
</p>
<p>was not only lit by the hall-light, but also by the light emanating
</p>
<p>from the parlor.
</p>
<p>Q. A full light?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever had any percussion-caps in your own posses-
</p>
<p>sion?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you had bullet-moulds ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I have had. I may have had them ; but I do
</p>
<p>not remember it.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it not a very common thing for people to have percussion-
</p>
<p>caps and bullet-moulds, particularly in these times?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant John W. Dempsey,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as

<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a photographic representation of
</p>
<p>" Morning, Noon, and Night " in a frame.] State whether or not
</p>
<p>you saw this in the house of the prisoner Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>A. This picture I found in the back room, on the fii'st floor
</p>
<p>Q. Did you examine it ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you found underneath the picture that is now

</p>
<p>A. The back part was all sealed ; and my curiosity was excited
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 41
</p>
<p>by seeing a piece torn oflPthe back. I opened it, and found the like-
</p>
<p>ness of J. Wilkes Booth,  a side-face view.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness Booth's photograh, Exhibit No.
</p>
<p>1 .] Is that the man ?
</p>
<p>A. That is the same face, with one exception,  that the picture
</p>
<p>I found in this room was a side-view. I turned the picture over to
</p>
<p>Colonel Ingraham. The person represented in both photographs is
</p>
<p>the same.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the picture of Booth visible from this frame ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>[The picture and frame were offered in evidence without objec-
</p>
<p>tion.]
</p>
<p>Q. You say the picture of Booth was not visible in this frame ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not. The word "Booth" was written in pencil on
</p>
<p>the back of it. I will not positively swear that the initials " J. W."
</p>
<p>were on it ; but the word " Booth " was certainly on the back of
</p>
<p>the photograph.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Under ordinary circumstances, would you consider the finding
</p>
<p>of the picture of Booth to be proof that the person in whose house
</p>
<p>it was was engaged in a conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not understand you. .
</p>
<p>Q. Would you think the person guilty of treasonable practices in
</p>
<p>whose possession you should find a picture of Booth accidentally or
</p>
<p>in any other way ?
</p>
<p>A member of the Court objected to the question, because it asked
</p>
<p>for the opinions of the witness on a hypothetical case.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been in the habit of seeing pictures of Booth, and
</p>
<p>leaders of the Rebellion, exposed for sale about in different places ?
</p>
<p>A. I was a prisoner for thirteen months ; and, during that time, I
</p>
<p>saw a good many of the leaders of the Rebellion, both personally

<p>42 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. You never have seen photographs of Davis and Lee ?
</p>
<p>A. Very few, except those seen in the newspapers,  the Sunday-
</p>
<p>papers particularly.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen them published in newspapers?
</p>
<p>A, Occasionallv, I think I have.
</p>
<p>Q. In loyal newspapers at the North ?
</p>
<p>A. I think in one instance I have, on or about the time the Re-
</p>
<p>bellion first broke out,  only exhibiting Jefferson Davis's portrait
</p>
<p>as the former Secretary of War, and then leader of the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>I think I saw it in one of the Sunday papers of New York.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not been in the habit of seeing the pictures of emi-
</p>
<p>nent actors in the hands of diffijrent parties who preserved them ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say that I have noticed particularly so. I have
</p>
<p>seen some.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen them exposed for sale at different places ?
</p>
<p>A, Within the last four years, I have had very little to do with
</p>
<p>any thing outside of the army ; and, if I did formerly, it slipped my
</p>
<p>memory.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not think you have?
</p>
<p>A. I am not much of a theatrical character myself; and for that
</p>
<p>reason I have nothing to say, and do not know any thing about it.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not inquiring about your being a theatrical character.
</p>
<p>I ask you if you have not been in the habit of seeing the pictures
</p>
<p>of eminent actors exposed for sale throughout the country.
</p>
<p>A. I have seen likenesses of Forrest, Macready, and others.

<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Binguam :
</p>
<p>Q. Look at the prisoner Payne, and see whether you ever saw
</p>
<p>him dressed with that coat on before [the prisoner being dressed as
</p>
<p>before directed by the Judge Advocate] .
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he had that coat on the time he last came to the

<p>house, when he staid there three days.

</p>
<p>see whether you ever saw that vest before.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 43
</p>
<p>A. Yes : he liad that vest on. I know it by the buttons.
</p>
<p>[The vest was oflfered in evidence without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, during that three-days' sojourn in Mrs. Surratt's
</p>
<p>house, wear a white cravat ?
</p>
<p>A. He wore a black cravat.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ever wear a white cravat while at her house at any
</p>
<p>time?
</p>
<p>A. No, su- : I never saw him with a white cravat.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Did all this happen at a time when you were giving informa-
</p>
<p>tion to the War Department^ and at the same time on an intimate
</p>
<p>footing with Mrs. Surratt and her. family?
</p>
<p>A. I was on an intimate footing.
</p>
<p>Q. I ask you about the time.
</p>
<p>A. The time, as near as I can recollect, was about the loth of
</p>
<p>March. It was on this occasion that Payne once went to the
</p>
<p>theatre with John Surratt to see the play of " Jane Shore : " I can
</p>
<p>fix the time more easily by that date. I communicated ray sus-
</p>
<p>picions to Captain Gleason the very morning 
</p>
<p>Q. No matter about Captain Gleason : I want the time.
</p>
<p>A Member of the Commission (General Wallace). Allow
</p>
<p>the witness to answer the question,
</p>
<p>A. I communicated ray suspicions to the War Department the
</p>
<p>very morning after this horseback-ride took place.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I object to that testimony. I am asking the wit-
</p>
<p>ness to fix a certain time when he did a certain thing. All he has
</p>
<p>to do is to answer as to a certain date. It is unnecessary for him to
</p>
<p>go into particulars about the War Department.
</p>
<p>A. I communicated my suspicions to Captain Gleason 
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I object to that. I want you to answer, and tell
</p>
<p>me exactly what time this visit of Payne wag.
</p>
<p>A. The second and last visit of Payne, to my recollection, was
</p>
<p>about the l-ith of March. He came there on the evening of

<p>the 
</p>
<p>Q. Was it the visit when you say he had this coat on ?
</p>
<p>44 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was on the evening: of the 13th of March. He
</p>
<p>remained three days,  the 14th, 15th, and 16th. On the 15th of
</p>
<p>March, he went in company with John Surratt to the theatre 
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I wish 
</p>
<p>The President. The counsel will allow the witness to answer
</p>
<p>the question ; and, if he objects to the answer, let him make it for-
</p>
<p>mally after the witness has got through.
</p>
<p>A. I remember the fact of his having been there, by Payne
</p>
<p>going to the theatre with Surratt at this time. It was when "Jane
</p>
<p>Shore" was playing. Forrest was playing at the theatre at that
</p>
<p>time. Forrest played four nights that week. Payne went with
</p>
<p>John SuiTatt, Miss Fitzpatrick, and Miss Dean. SuiTatt had got
</p>
<p>a ten-dollar ticket. The next day, this horseback-ride occurred ;
</p>
<p>and the next day (the 17th) I communicated my suspicions to
</p>
<p>Captain Grleason, of the War Department. I had spoken to him
</p>
<p>previously, on various occasions, about this blockade-mnner, and
</p>
<p>about this woman ; but I cannot fix the precise date.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I object to the reception of the testimony just
</p>
<p>given so far as it goes further than a mere answer to my question.
</p>
<p>I asked the witness to fix a date. He has fixed the date ; namely,
</p>
<p>the evening of the 13th of March. Beyond that I asked nothing;
</p>
<p>and all that he has said beyond it is mere surplusage, and does not
</p>
<p>bear on the case.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. The gentleman asked
</p>
<p>him further, whether that date was the time when he communicated
</p>
<p>his suspicions to the Government. That was an additional part of
</p>
<p>the question ; and the witness has gone on to fix it.
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand the witness now to fix the 16th of jMarch
</p>
<p>as the date of that horseback-ride ?

<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate BiNOiLiM :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether you had the prisoner Payne
</p>
<p>in your custody on the night of his arrest,  the 17th of April
</p>
<p>last.
</p>
<p>A. I had.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he dressed in the dark-gray coat he now has on?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he had on that coat, a pair of black pants, and
</p>
<p>something that looked like a skull-cap. I took off his coat, shirt,
</p>
<p>pants, vest, and all his clothing, the next day, on board of the
</p>
<p>monitor.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness a pair of pantaloons and a vest.]
</p>
<p>Do you recognize these ?
</p>
<p>A. These were worn by him. He had a white shirt on at the
</p>
<p>time, a linen shirt, and an undershirt minus one sleeve.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting a box containing the various articles named.]
</p>
<p>Do you recognize them all ?
</p>
<p>A. Those are the articles : there is a very distinct mark by
</p>
<p>which they can be recognized. I pointed it out to the prisoner at
</p>
<p>the time in the examination. I described to her what I supposed
</p>
<p>his condition was when he committed the assault, and said to him
</p>
<p>that I should find the blood on the coat-sleeve inside of the coat he
</p>
<p>is wearing. I found it also on the white shirt-sleeve. [The wit-
</p>
<p>ness exhibited the blood-spots thus referred to.] I called his atten-
</p>
<p>tion to it at the time, and said, " What do you think now ? " He
</p>
<p>leaned back against the side of the boat, and said nothing.
</p>
<p>[The articles referred to were offered in evidence without objec-
</p>
<p>tion.]
</p>
<p>I also took from him the boots that have been shown here.
</p>
<p>There was then upon them a broad ink-stain, that is now to be
</p>
<p>seen on one of them, on the inside. I asked him where he got those
</p>
<p>boots. He said that he bought them in Baltimore, and had worn

</p>
<p>them three months. I called his attention to the falsehood that
</p>
<p>was apparent from the fact that the boots had only been slightly
</p>
<p>worn. He made no reply to that. I then took him away with me,
</p>
<p>46 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>and sent one of the boots to the Treasury Department,  if possible,
</p>
<p>to ascertain what that name was.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster ;
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that you saw blood on the coat the
</p>
<p>prisoner has on now ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliereabouts was that blood ?
</p>
<p>A. On the lining of the sleeve.
</p>
<p>Q. Which side ?  outside ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I turned the sleeve up, inside ; I think, on the left
</p>
<p>arm.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not threaten the prisoner at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not, at the time you were examining about those
</p>
<p>boots, and he told you he had worn them three months, tell him
</p>
<p>be was a liar ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I did : I told him that several times.
</p>
<p>Q. You are very positive, however, that the blood was found on
</p>
<p>this coat ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see blood on any other coat ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : on the overcoat that was brought to me from near
</p>
<p>Fort Bunker Hill, there were stains that appeared to be blood-stains.
</p>
<p>I called the prisoner's attention to the fact ; and I said, " How did
</p>
<p>that blood come there? " Said he, '* It is not blood ! " I said,
</p>
<p>" Look and see, and say if you can tell me it is not blood." He
</p>
<p>looked at it apjain, and said, "I do not know how it came there."
</p>
<p>Q. How did you know it was blood ?
</p>
<p>A. Because I saw it.

</p>
<p>see the gentleman with him.

</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I was too far from the road to tell you what sort
</p>
<p>of a looking gentleman it was.
</p>
<p>Q. When you went into Bryantown yourself, you did not see
</p>
<p>him there ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 49
</p>
<p>A. No : he had returned before I went to Bryantown. I went
</p>
<p>to Bryantown in a very short time after he passed my house.
</p>
<p>Q. If he had come back the same road without Dr. Mudd, he
</p>
<p>would have had to pass your house in the same way ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And you would have been likely ^/) see him ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I was not all the time there. I happened to be stand-
</p>
<p>ing at the door, and looking down the road, when I saw Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>pass, and a gentleman with him. When he went back, the gentle-
</p>
<p>man was not with him.
</p>
<p>Q. How long do you think the doctor staid in Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think he staid a quarter of an hour ; but I do not
</p>
<p>know : I have not any thing to tell by.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not a dark, cloudy evening ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was a dark, drizzly, foggy evening.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it getting on to sunset ?
</p>
<p>A. It was getting late in the evening,  not exactly towards
</p>
<p>sunset.
</p>
<p>Q. How far does Dr. Mudd live from Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. I reckon, about four miles,  perhaps not that far : I do not
</p>
<p>know the exact distance.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you tell whether it was an old man or a young man
</p>
<p>who was riding with Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you tell what sort of a horse he was on ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not take much account of it, because I have often
</p>
<p>seen the doctor pass that road. The horse appeared to me to be a
</p>
<p>bay horse.
</p>
<p>Q. The horse the other man was riding ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the horse the other gentleman was riding.
</p>
<p>Q. What sort of a horse was the doctor riding?
</p>
<p>A. I think, a kind of dark-gray ; but I did not take much no-
</p>
<p>tice of the horse, because I know the doctor when I see him.

<p>50 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you tell wlietlier the man witli the doctor was a large
</p>
<p>man or a small man ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not. I was too far from the road ; and I took but
</p>
<p>little account of it. I did not pay much particular notice.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they riding side by side, or one before the other?
</p>
<p>A. They were riding side by side when I saw them.
</p>
<p>Q. The soldiers had been passing about there that day, had they
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of. I never heard of it until I went to
</p>
<p>town.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see any pass your house ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.

</p>
<p>Bryantown, is there ?

</p>
<p>Q. There is no road between your house and Bryantown but
</p>
<p>one ?  no fork at all ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And, if the man that went with Dr. Mudd had returned, he
</p>
<p>would have been obliged to go by your house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was obliged to go through Bryantown, or go
</p>
<p>back the same way as he went.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Did the doctor return before you started to the town ? or did
</p>
<p>you meet him ?
</p>
<p>A. He had passed my house before I started : a very short
</p>
<p>time, though.

<p>Q. Will you state to the Court what position you occupy in the
</p>
<p>public service?
</p>
<p>A. I am Assistant Secretary of War.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a revolving cylinder in a frame,
</p>
<p>with a table, composed of letters of the alphabet variously arranged,
</p>
<p>pasted on the cylinder.] Look at that article, and state whether you
</p>
<p>have seen it before, and under what circumstances,
</p>
<p>A. I took this out of the office of Mr. Benjamin, the Rebel Sec-
</p>
<p>retary of State, at Richmond. Richmond was evacuated on Monday,
</p>
<p>the 3d of April. I arrived there on the Wednesday following, the
</p>
<p>5th ; and, on the 6th of April, I went into Mr. Benjamin's office, and
</p>
<p>there this was found. I sent it to Major Eckert, at the War Depart-
</p>
<p>ment, who has charge of ciphers there. I saw it was a key to the
</p>
<p>official rebel cipher ; and, as we had a good many of them to decipher
</p>
<p>at different times, this seemed to be very interesting ; and I brought
</p>
<p>it away accordingly.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find it in his trunk ? or where ?
</p>
<p>A. No : Mr. Benjamin's office had consisted of a series of three
</p>
<p>or four rooms. I think there were four rooms in succession. Ben-
</p>
<p>jamin's own personal office was the inmost of all. This was tlie next
</p>
<p>room to that, in the room where his library was : it seemed to be a
</p>
<p>room occupied, I should say, by his most confidential clerk or assist-
</p>
<p>ant. It was there standino; on a shelf amonor his books and other
</p>
<p>things. Most of the articles had been taken away from the office ;
</p>
<p>the records had all been taken away : but I found several interest-
</p>
<p>ing documents, and this among them.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What is the object of this instrument?
</p>
<p>A. This is a key to a cipher. The purpose of this cipher is to
</p>
<p>use letters of the alphabet for other letters, as " a " for " x " and
</p>
<p>for "m," &c., which follows a regular system. By shifting the
</p>
<p>pointers fixed in the fi-ame over the cylinder, according to certain

<p>Major T. T. Eckert
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the cipher marked Exhibit No. 7,
</p>
<p>and also the Exhibit No. 59.] Look at the cipher which is Exhibit
</p>
<p>No. 7, which is said to have been found in the trunk of J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, and compare it with the other cipher of which the Assistant-
</p>
<p>Secretary of War (Mr. Dana) has just spoken, and state whether
</p>
<p>or not they are the same.
</p>
<p>A. They are the same. I have examined and compared them.
</p>
<p>Q. You are somewhat familiar, are you not, with the deciphering
</p>
<p>of ciphers of that kind ?
</p>
<p>A. I am.
</p>
<p>Q. You have no doubt as to their being the same ?
</p>
<p>A. None at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not cipher-despatches from the
</p>
<p>rebel authorities have, from tune to time, fallen into the hands of
</p>
<p>the department, and been referred to you for examination ?
</p>
<p>A. They have been.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not they were the same cipher with
</p>
<p>these of which you are now speaking ?
</p>
<p>A. Some were worked on the same principles.
</p>
<p>Q. I speak now particularly of cipher-despatches of the 13th and
</p>
<p>19th of October last. Have you them in your possession ?
</p>
<p>A. I have.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you the originals ?
</p>
<p>A. We have not the originals. We have copies of the originals.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you produce them ?
</p>
<p>[The witness produced copies of the originals of the despatches,
</p>
<p>and also translations of the despatches as deciphered.]
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not those despatches are written in the same
</p>
<p>cipher with the others of which you have spoken.
</p>
<p>A. I think they are written in the same cipher. There may be

<p>a difference of the key, as every thing depends on that ; but the
</p>
<p>principle is the same.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you translated them ?
</p>
<p>68 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. My clerks have.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean that the cipher used is the same as that on the
</p>
<p>wheel dosio-nated Exhibit No. 59 ?
</p>
<p>A. They were worked out without this cipher, or any knowledge
</p>
<p>of this at the time ; but it is the same principle as the wheel.
</p>
<p>Q. Are these translations of those despatches?
</p>
<p>A. [After examining the originals and translations.] These are
</p>
<p>the translations.
</p>
<p>The despatches were read, as follows : 
</p>
<p>" October 13, 1864.
</p>
<p>" "We again urge the immense necessity of our gaining immediate
</p>
<p>advantages. Strain every nerve for victory. We now look upon
</p>
<p>the re-election of Lincoln in November as almost certain ; and we
</p>
<p>need to whip his hu-elings to prevent it. Besides, with Lincoln
</p>
<p>re-elected and his armies victorious, we need not hope even for
</p>
<p>recognition, much less the help mentioned in our last. Holcombe
</p>
<p>will explain this. Those figures of the Yankee armies~are correct
</p>
<p>to a unit. Our friend shall be immediately set to work as you
</p>
<p>direct."
</p>
<p>"October 19, 1864.
</p>
<p>*' Your letter of the 13th instant is at hand. There is yet time
</p>
<p>enough to colonize many voters before November. A blow will
</p>
<p>shortly be stricken here. It is not quite time. General Longstreet
</p>
<p>is to attack Sheridan without delav, and then move North as far as
</p>
<p>practicable, towards unprotected points.
</p>
<p>" This will be made instead of movement before mentioned.
</p>
<p>" He will endeavor to assist the Republicans in collecting their
</p>
<p>ballots. Be watchful, and assist him."
</p>
<p>Q. You state that these cipher-despatches were copies ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you please state whether or not the originals were sent
</p>
<p>to their destination ?
</p>
<p>A. The originals were sent to Richmond.

<p>BraGADIER-GENEIlAL ALEXANDER J. HAMILTON,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you are familiar with the handwriting
</p>
<p>of W. S. Oldham.
</p>
<p>A. Williamson S. Oldham is his name. I am as familiar with
</p>
<p>it, I think, as I am with the handwriting of any one living.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the letter signed " W. S. Oldham,"
</p>
<p>and marked Exhibit No. 42.] State whether or not that letter is
</p>
<p>in his handwriting.
</p>
<p>A. It is.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, at the time of writing it, he
</p>
<p>was a member of the Senate of the so-called Confederate States,
</p>
<p>from Texas?
</p>
<p>A. I will answer you, that, in 1861, I was present when he was?
</p>
<p>elected by the Rebel Legislature of Texas to a seat in the Senate of
</p>
<p>the Rebel Government ; and since then I know, simply as a matter
</p>
<p>of public history, that he has occupied that position.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he elected for six years?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I so understood it. I have seen many speeches
</p>
<p>of his from the Rebel Senate, and resolutions and bills introduced
</p>
<p>by him, in the public prints.
</p>
<p>Q. You are a citizen of Texas?

<p>Q. Do you know any tbing of the Professor McCullough spoken

<p>of in the body of that letter ?

<p>Surgeon-General Joseph K. Barnes
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you made an examination of the body
</p>
<p>of J. Wilkes Booth after his death, when brought to this city.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe to the Court the scar which is alleged to have been
</p>
<p>on his neck.
</p>
<p>A. The scar on the left side of the neck was occasioned by an
</p>
<p>operation performed by Dr. May, of this city, for the removal of a
</p>
<p>tumor, some months previously to Booth's death.
</p>
<p>Q. What was its peculiar appearance, if it had any peculiar
</p>
<p>appearance ?
</p>
<p>A. It looked like the scar of a bum, instead of an incision ;
</p>
<p>which Dr. May explained, from the fact that the wound was torn
</p>
<p>open on the stage, when nearly healed.
</p>
<p>Q. How near was it to the ear?
</p>
<p>A. Three inches below the ear, upon the large muscle of the
</p>
<p>neck.

<p>A. I was there in Bryantown on Saturday evening.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time were you there ?
</p>
<p>A. About three or four o'clock, as near as I can come at it.
</p>
<p>Q. About four o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. Between three and four o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or not see the prisoner Dr. Mudd there?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw him there on Saturday evening. I was in
</p>
<p>the store buying something.
</p>
<p>Q. What time do you think it was when you saw him there ?
</p>
<p>A. Between three and four o'clock on Saturday.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you see him,  in the streets, or in the store?
</p>
<p>A. He came in the store while I was in there.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not the soldiers from Washington
</p>
<p>had then arrived in Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know exactly whether they had or not.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not see them ? You do not know whether they had
</p>
<p>or not ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Were you around about the town during that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was in the store. I was not about the town :
</p>
<p>I was in the store buying some things. I did not take much notice
</p>
<p>of Dr. Mudd there then, I had met him so frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you leave the store ?
</p>
<p>A. When I left the store, the road was guarded,

<p>Q. At what time did you leave the store ?
</p>
<p>A. I left the store just before night. He was gone before I
</p>
<p>was.

<p>Q. At what time did you go into the store ?
</p>
<p>A. I went into the store just as quick as I went into the town.

<p>By Mr. Ewing :

<p>the day following the murder of the President,  Saturday, the 15th
</p>
<p>of April?
</p>
<p>A. I was in Bryantown then. I live in the suburbs of the vil-
</p>
<p>lage. I left my home, went to the village so soon as I finished my
</p>
<p>dinner, and arrived there about one o'clock. As soon as I arrived,
</p>
<p>I observed that the military were in town with Lieutenant Dana ;

<p>THE TRIAL. 63
</p>
<p>alight, I imagined at once they were going to search the houses. I
</p>
<p>went home, as there was no one there but my wife, fearing lest she
</p>
<p>should be alarmed, and remained there some time, expectino- it
</p>
<p>likely the soldiers would search the houses. Soon afterwards, a
</p>
<p>negro came up, and said the President had been assassinated. I
</p>
<p>immediately left home, and went to the village. After staying
</p>
<p>there but a short time, Lieutenant Dana put the village under mar-
</p>
<p>tial law ; and people began to get excited about getting home. Many
</p>
<p>of them wanted to get home, and thought it likely that they would
</p>
<p>be detained there for several hours, and would frequently go and
</p>
<p>make application to the commanding officer to let them go ; but he
</p>
<p>refused to do so. I returned home. Whether I said, or it was
</p>
<p>said in my presence, that Dr. Mudd 
</p>
<p>Q. State what you know about Dr. Mudd. Did you see Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd the prisoner there ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say positively that I ^did see Dr. Mudd. The ex-
</p>
<p>citement was so great, that I cannot say positively that I saw him at
</p>
<p>the village.
</p>
<p>Q. What is your best recollection about your having seen him
</p>
<p>on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. I would not like to say positively that I saw him there ; but
</p>
<p>it recurs to me by faint memory that he was there. I could not
</p>
<p>swear positively that he was there. The excitement has been so
</p>
<p>great since then, and at that particular time, that it would be im-
</p>
<p>possible for me to weigh the thoughts of that day at the present
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you reached the town at about one o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. I judge so, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You found the military there, and the people very much
</p>
<p>excited ?
</p>
<p>A. Yery much excited.
</p>
<p>Q. You returned home ?
</p>
<p>A. I returned home.

</p>
<p>Q. And then you came back to the town at what time ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose I remained home about three-quarters of an hour.
</p>
<p>Q. And then, when you returned to the town, did you or not
</p>
<p>hear of the assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>64 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear, in connection with it, the name of the as-
</p>
<p>sassin ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. "UTiat name ?
</p>
<p>A. Booth. Some gave the name of Booth, and others Boose ;
</p>
<p>but the inference was that it was Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear it spoken of, everywhere where the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion itself was spoken of, that he was the assassin ?
</p>
<p>A. At Bryantown, where I was, I heard it spoken of by every-
</p>
<p>body,  first by the miUtary, and they communicated the idea to
</p>
<p>the citizens, and they spread it about that Booth was the assassin.
</p>
<p>Q. At what hour do you suppose it was that you heard it ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose it was between one and two o'clock. It was a
</p>
<p>very cloudy day, and I never paid any particular attention to the
</p>
<p>time of day ; but it was between one and two o'clock.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did you leave Bryantown the second time that
</p>
<p>you went up ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell exactly the moment of the day, because I
</p>
<p>had no time : it was a real cloudy day ; and I was paying but little
</p>
<p>attention to the passing moments of the day, and could not give any
</p>
<p>precise time that I left.
</p>
<p>Q. I said about what time ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose it was between two and three o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean between two and three o'clock that ypu left the
</p>
<p>second time?
</p>
<p>A. Between two and three o'clock that I left the second time.
</p>
<p>I guess it was verging on one o'clock when I first arrived at Bryan-
</p>
<p>town ; and then I found the excitement. I left immediately ; staid
</p>
<p>but a very short while ; and, in a very few moments, it was told me
</p>
<p>that the President had been assassinated. I came immediately to
</p>
<p>Bryantown, and remained there some while afterwards. Indeed, I

<p>could not state how long I remained before I left for home.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear that the President had been assassinated before
</p>
<p>you left Bryantown the first time ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 65
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. The first knowledge I had of it was by the darky.
</p>
<p>Q. You said that some said the name of the assassin was
</p>
<p>"Boose"?
</p>
<p>A. That name was spoken by the soldiers with whom the
</p>
<p>English language was hardly conversant. They could not say
</p>
<p>"Booth" audibly.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. I suppose they were German soldiers ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose so. Very likely, if you had told them the name
</p>
<p>was " Booth," they would call it " Boose," or something like that.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Some said it was ** Boose," and some said it was " Booth"?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Those who could speak audibly told me it was
</p>
<p>" Booth; " and those who seemed to have an amalgamation of the
</p>
<p>languages called it " Boose."
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you when you first heard that the President was
</p>
<p>assassinated ? Were you at your house ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I left my house when I heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you hear it first ? At your home ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard it at home ; I heard it at my house ; and I have
</p>
<p>told you it was on the authority of a darky that I heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was the " darky " ?
</p>
<p>A. A brother of the fellow whose testimony you have just taken.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his name ?
</p>
<p>A. Charles Blovce. He told me that the President had been as-
</p>
<p>Bassinated. I immediately left home, and went to the village, where
</p>
<p>I found it a current report.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ask him who had assassinated the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I have no knowledge of asking him that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he tell you who had ?
</p>
<p>A. He never told me. I do not know that he understood who
</p>
<p>did it.
</p>
<p>Q. In what direction from the centre of the town do you live ?

<p>66 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you live near or on the road between Bryantown and Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's ?
</p>
<p>A. I live very close to the road leading through Bryantown ;
</p>
<p>but I was never at Dr. Mudd's house. I know the direction ; but
</p>
<p>I should suppose it was between four and five miles  from what I
</p>
<p>have heard of Dr. Mudd's house  from Bryantown.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you live near or on the road between Bryantown and Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Where is it your impression that you saw Dr. Mudd in the
</p>
<p>town ?
</p>
<p>A. If it be Dr. Mudd that I saw, I saw him going to his horse ;
</p>
<p>but I could not say positively that it was Dr. Mudd. I must put
</p>
<p>in a " don't know " as to whether it was Dr. Mudd.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the face of this person that you supposed to be
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of; but I could tell Dr. Mudd by a side-
</p>
<p>view or a back-view, if I was to see him anywhere.
</p>
<p>Q. If you saw his back, then, as he was walking off, you would
</p>
<p>know that it was Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Being near to the doctor, I should.
</p>
<p>Q. How close were you to this person that you thought was
</p>
<p>him ?
</p>
<p>A. I would say about ten or twelve yards, standing on the porch
</p>
<p>of the store.
</p>
<p>Q. And you are only able to swear to an impression ?
</p>
<p>A. To an impression,  not positively.
</p>
<p>Q. And a faint impression 'I
</p>
<p>A. To a faint impression : I cannot swear positively.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the color of the horse that this man was goins to?
</p>
<p>A. I did not note the color of the horse. I paid no attention to
</p>
<p>it, and was not thinking of his horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the horse that Dr. Mudd usually rides ?

</p>
<p>A. I have seen him on different horses, I think. I have seen
</p>
<p>him sometimes ride a bay horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the horse that this man was going to one of the horses
</p>
<p>you have seen Dr. Mudd ride, or like one of them ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 67
</p>
<p>A. If it be Dr. Mudd that was there, the horse to whicli he was
</p>
<p>going was amid many horses ; and there were so many horses con-
</p>
<p>nected together there, that I could not state any thing in regard to
</p>
<p>the color of the horse.
</p>
<p>Q. It was on your first going into Bryantown that you saw him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : the second time.
</p>
<p>Q. Fix again the hour when you went there the second time.
</p>
<p>A. I suppose it was three-quarters of an hour after I went home ;
</p>
<p>say about three-quarters after one.
</p>
<p>Q. About a quarter before two o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. Or a quarter before two.
</p>
<p>Q. "Was this person then in the town ? Did you see him as you
</p>
<p>went in ?
</p>
<p>A. In leaving the house, I came into the back of the store ; and
</p>
<p>it was in front of the store that I saw the person.
</p>
<p>Q. It was immediately on your arrival the second time ?
</p>
<p>A. On my arriving the second time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any other name in connection with the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation of the President, except the names of Boose and Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not at that particular time ; not on that day, Saturday,
</p>
<p>April 15th.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. Dr. Mudd, very well when you
</p>
<p>saw hun ?
</p>
<p>A. I am personally acquainted with Dr. Mudd, and have been
</p>
<p>for two years and five months ; and, before that time, I had a tran-
</p>
<p>sient acquaintance with him.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant David D. Dana,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows :

</p>
<p>68 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state at wliat hour you and your men arrived there
</p>
<p>on that day ?
</p>
<p>A. I had sent a guard of four men ahead of me into the town ;
</p>
<p>and they kept ahead of me all the way to the town. They arrived
</p>
<p>there twenty minutes or half an hour before I did. I arrived there
</p>
<p>near one o'clock that Saturday afternoon, the Satui'day following the
</p>
<p>assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, on your arrival, the intelli-
</p>
<p>gence of the assassination was spread through the town ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was. I communicated the intellio-ence to the
</p>
<p>citizens, and also told the name of the party assassinating the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you mention as the assassin the name of Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : J. Wilkes Booth. Some of the citizens asked me
</p>
<p>if I knew for a certainty that it was him ; and I told them, " Yes : as
</p>
<p>near as a person could know any thing."
</p>
<p>Q. Are you or not quite certain that at that hour  say one
</p>
<p>o'clock  it was known throuo;hout that villas-e ?
</p>
<p>A. As early as a quarter-past one, it was known all through the
</p>
<p>villasfe that the President had been assassinated, and who the assas-
</p>
<p>sin was.
</p>
<p>Q, Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar. Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not.
</p>
<p>Q, You have no knowledge whether you met him on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion or not ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not.

</p>
<p>Q. Look at that knife [submitting a knife to the witness], and
</p>
<p>TEE TRIAL. 69
</p>
<p>state whether or not you found it in the street : if so, when and
</p>
<p>"where.
</p>
<p>A. This looks like the knife I found in front of Secretary Sew-
</p>
<p>ard's house ?
</p>
<p>Q. Opposite it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you find it there ?
</p>
<p>A. It was on Friday his family got hurt ; and I found it on Sat-
</p>
<p>urday morning,
</p>
<p>Q. The Saturday morning after he was stabbed ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you find it quite near the pavement, or out in the middle
</p>
<p>of the street ?
</p>
<p>A. Out in the street.
</p>
<p>Q. To whom did you give the knife ?
</p>
<p>A. There is one gentleman I see here now [pointing to Surgeon
</p>
<p>John Wilson, United-States Army], that took it after I gave it to
</p>
<p>one officer at the door : I do not see here the first one that took it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that knife to be the same one you found ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that it is the same one : I say it is like the
</p>
<p>one I found.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take the knife you found out of the sheath ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not in a sheath.
</p>
<p>Q. Whereabouts exactly did you find it ?
</p>
<p>A. Right in front of Secretary Seward's house, in the middle of
</p>
<p>the street.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it in the street, or the gutter ?
</p>
<p>A. It was in the middle of the street, not in the ontter.
</p>
<p>Q. Right in front of the door ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What time of the day did you find it ?
</p>
<p>A. It was early in the morning : I was going to market. I sup-

</p>
<p>John Wilson,
</p>
<p>a witness for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Look at that knife [submitting to the witness the knife shown
</p>
<p>to Robert Nelson], and state from whom you received it, and when.
</p>
<p>A. This is the knife I received from the colored boy who has
</p>
<p>just left the stand. I received it on Saturday, the 15th of April;
</p>
<p>probably about ten o'clock in the day.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did this boy Nelson give it to you ?
</p>
<p>A. He gave it to me in the library-room of IMr. Seward's house.
</p>
<p>He brought it in at the door, and handed it to me.
</p>
<p>Joseph B. Stewart,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you were at Ford's Thea-
</p>
<p>tre on the night of the assassination of the President.
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you saw the assassin leap from the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent's box upon the stage.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or not follow him ? State the cu'cumstanees of
</p>
<p>your pursuit.
</p>
<p>A. I did follow him. At about near half-past ten, I was sitting
</p>
<p>in the front seat of the orchestra, on the right-hand side. There are
</p>
<p>two aisles in the orchestra. My seat was the one forming the cor-
</p>
<p>ner-seat on the left-hand side of the right-hand aisle, which would
</p>
<p>bring me immediately next to the music-stand. The report of a pis-
</p>
<p>tol, which was evidently a charged pistol,  a sharp report, 
</p>
<p>startled me. I was talking at the moment to my sister, who sat by
</p>
<p>me, my head leaning to the left. I glanced still farther left, and im-
</p>
<p>mediately back to the stage ; and at the same time an exclamation
</p>
<p>was made, and simultaneously a man leaped from the President's

<p>box, alighting on the stage, exclaiming, as he came out, some words
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 71
</p>
<p>which I understood. He came down with his hack slightly to the
</p>
<p>audience ; but, rising and turning, his face came in full view. At
</p>
<p>the same instant, I rose up, and attempted to leap on the stage di-
</p>
<p>rectly from where I sat. My foot slipped from the rail. My eye,
</p>
<p>at the same time, discovered the distance ; and, without stopping my
</p>
<p>motion at all, I turned, and made two or three steps on the railing,
</p>
<p>and jumped on the stage to the right of the foot-lights from where I
</p>
<p>sat ; keeping my attention all the time, after selecting my course,
</p>
<p>upon the man who was crossing the stage, and who had just jumped
</p>
<p>from the President's box. When I reached the stage, as I was
</p>
<p>reaching it, looking in an angle to the left, I perceived that he dis-
</p>
<p>appeared at the same instant around the left-hand stage-entrance.
</p>
<p>Being on the stage, I crossed it as quick as possible. I had never
</p>
<p>been on the stao;e, and knew nothinoj about the condition of the
</p>
<p>building, or the means of exit ; but I supposed the person was get-
</p>
<p>ting out, and I followed the direction he took. I exclaimed, " Stop
</p>
<p>that man ! " three times. The last time, and when I had passed the
</p>
<p>length of the stage, and turned to the right, and when, I supjx)se,
</p>
<p>within a distance of from twenty to twenty-five feet from the door,
</p>
<p>the door slammed decidedly,  came to, closed. I was going just
</p>
<p>as fast as I could, and got to the door, of course, very quickly.
</p>
<p>Coming against the door, I touched it first on the side where it did
</p>
<p>not open. I then caught hold of the door at the proper point, opened
</p>
<p>it, and passed out. The last time that I exclaimed, " Stop that
</p>
<p>man ! " some one said, " He is getting on a horse ; and at the door,
</p>
<p>almost as soon as the words reached my ears, I heard the tramping
</p>
<p>of a horse. On opening the door after the balk at the door which
</p>
<p>prevented me from opening it at first, I perceived a man mounting
</p>
<p>a horse. He was at that instant rather imperfectly mounted. The
</p>
<p>moon was just beginning to rise ; and I could see a little elevated
</p>
<p>better than I could immediately down to the ground. The horse
</p>
<p>was moving in a quick, agitated motion, as a horse will do if pre-
</p>
<p>maturely spurred in mounting, with the rein drawn a little to one

<p>side ; and, for a moment, the horse described a kind of circle from the
</p>
<p>right to the left, which I noticed. I noticed at the same time that
</p>
<p>there were on the left some tenement-houses. I ran in the direc-
</p>
<p>tion where the horse was heading ; and when within eight or ten feet

</p>
<p>of the head of the horse, and alraost up within reach of the left flank
</p>
<p>of the horse, the rider brouo-ht hira round somewhat in a similar
</p>
<p>circle from the left to the right ao-ain, crossinoj over : the horse's feet
</p>
<p>rattling violently on what seemed to be rocks. I crossed in the same
</p>
<p>direction, aiming at the rein, and was now on the right flank of the
</p>
<p>horse. He was rather gaining on me then, though not yet in a forward
</p>
<p>movement. I could have reached his flank myself with my hand
</p>
<p>when perhaps two-thirds of the way over the alley. Again he backed
</p>
<p>to the right-hand side of the alley, brought the horse forward and
</p>
<p>spurred him, and at the same instant crouched forward down over
</p>
<p>the pommel of the saddle ; and the horse went forward then, and soon
</p>
<p>swept to the left up towards F Street. I still ran after the horse
</p>
<p>some forty or fifty yards. I commanded the person to stop in the
</p>
<p>alley. The horse went on rapidly after starting- forward. It all
</p>
<p>occupied a space of a few seconds fiom the time I reached the stage
</p>
<p>until this occurred.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you found the door closed : did you see anybody
</p>
<p>standing about the door ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. One or more persons ?
</p>
<p>A. I passed several persons in that passage-way, ladies and gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen,  one or two men : I think, in all, perhaps five persons, a3
</p>
<p>near as I could estimate without being able to count them. Xear
</p>
<p>the door, on my right-hand side, I passed a person standing, who
</p>
<p>seemed to be in the act of turning. I was noticing every thing that
</p>
<p>came before me, as I was impressed with what had occurred ; and I
</p>
<p>saw a person who did not seem to be moving about like the others.
</p>
<p>Every one else I saw but that one person was in a teiTible commo-
</p>
<p>tion, and moving about.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you describe that person's appearance ? Do you think
</p>
<p>you would recognize hira again ?
</p>
<p>A. I would not like to undertake to recognize him positively ; but
</p>
<p>I have a very distinct impression in my mind about the size and ap-

<p>pearance of that man.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at the prisoners here, and say whether either of them, in
</p>
<p>your opinion, is that person.
</p>
<p>A. I know none of these prisoners ; and I see but one face among
</p>
<p>them there that would call to mind that person.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 73
</p>
<p>Q. Which is that ?
</p>
<p>A. There it is [pointing to Edward Spangler].
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the person ?
</p>
<p>A. That man looks more like the person I saw near the door
</p>
<p>than anybody else I see there. He makes the impression of the
</p>
<p>man's visage as I caught it as I was going along very rapidly.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe his bearing.
</p>
<p>A. As I approached the door, about as far as from here to the
</p>
<p>wall of this room [indicating a distance of about fifteen feet], the
</p>
<p>person who was at the door was facing towards the door ; but, as I
</p>
<p>got nearer, he turned around partially, so that I had a view of him.
</p>
<p>The view I had was the view of a person turning from a quarter,
</p>
<p>describing three-quarters of a circle ; and, as he turned, the size and
</p>
<p>visage were observed so far as to leave on my mind an impression
</p>
<p>of the visage.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he turning away from the door ?
</p>
<p>A. Turning from the door, and towards me.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. There is a passage-way between the scenes and the green-
</p>
<p>room, about two and a half or three feet in width, through which
</p>
<p>Booth ran as he passed out of the door. Was it in that passage-way
</p>
<p>that you met this person ? or was it between the scenes ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know where the green-room is. I never was on the
</p>
<p>stage before. If I had a diagram of the building, I could point out
</p>
<p>the spot.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the diagram heretofore offered in
</p>
<p>evidence, and marked Exhibit No. 48,] This is a plan of the thea-
</p>
<p>tre : now describe the locality.
</p>
<p>A. When I was coming through the passage from the front of the
</p>
<p>stage to the door, I saw a person near the side-door, as I advanced
</p>
<p>in that direction rapidly ; and I observed a person standing at the
</p>
<p>outer door, who, as I have described, was turning from the right to
</p>
<p>the left when I noticed him. It was in what you may call the pas-

<p>after passing over the stage and turning to the right,  going towards

</p>
<p>74 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. About how far from the door did the man stand ?
</p>
<p>A. About three feet.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice him there just after the door closed?
</p>
<p>A. Just after it slammed. I was approaching the door. It was
</p>
<p>my expectation, when I reached the stage, to catch the person who
</p>
<p>had jumped from the President's box, inside of the house, or very
</p>
<p>soon after he should get out of it ; and I was watching very closely
</p>
<p>every person whom I approached.
</p>
<p>Q, If this man had been the person who slammed the door, would
</p>
<p>you have noticed him doing it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. A person standing in that position could, by a
</p>
<p>reach of the arm, have slammed the door, and I could not have
</p>
<p>noticed it.
</p>
<p>Q. But would not that have thrown him around ? would it not
</p>
<p>have given him a motion different from the motion that he was
</p>
<p>making as you approached ?
</p>
<p>A. I recollect well the action of the door. It is a narrow door,
</p>
<p> not a wide door. Approaching it, it opens inwards to the right
</p>
<p>as you approach. When I came against the door, I came with my
</p>
<p>hand, and somewhat damaged my hand against a part of the hinge.
</p>
<p>The door was very narrow; and any one standing in that man's posi-
</p>
<p>tion could have slammed the door very easily by reaching his hand
</p>
<p>to it.
</p>
<p>Q. Whicli way does the door open,  towards the side that the
</p>
<p>President was on, or from the side that the President was on?
</p>
<p>A. Aproaching the door from the stage to the rear, it hinges
</p>
<p>from the rio-ht to the left. Enterinoj it from the outside, it would
</p>
<p>swing back from the left to the right to the inside. I came vio-
</p>
<p>lently against the door when I went to open it.
</p>
<p>Q. That is, the lock of the door, when the door was shut, was on
</p>
<p>the side nearest the side on which the President sat ?
</p>
<p>A. If you will give me a slip of paper, I will describe the way
</p>
<p>the door stood.

<p>Mr. Ewing. The Court has been there.
</p>
<p>The Witness. Then they will understand me. The lock of tho
</p>
<p>door, approaching it, was on my right-hand side, the hinge to the left.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 75
</p>
<p>Not knowing which side it swung on, I came against it on the left ;
</p>
<p>and therefore I had to change my position before I could get out.
</p>
<p>If the door had been opened so that I would not have been stopped
</p>
<p>at it, I could have got the range of that horse outside.
</p>
<p>Q. But the person you speak of, who, you think, resembles the
</p>
<p>prisoner Spangler, as you approached towards the door, was turning
</p>
<p>from left to right ?
</p>
<p>A. No : the other way. The door being on his right-hand side,
</p>
<p>he was turning to the left.
</p>
<p>Q, Had he his back towards the door?
</p>
<p>A. His right side stood quarter-face to the door, coming to-
</p>
<p>wards me.
</p>
<p>Q. His body was moving around from the door, and towards you?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : from the door.
</p>
<p>Q. That is not the motion that the movement of shutting the
</p>
<p>door would gradually give to the body, is it ?
</p>
<p>A. That would be owing to which hand the door was shut
</p>
<p>"with.
</p>
<p>Q. With either hand ?
</p>
<p>A. With the rio;ht hand, it mifi;ht or mio;ht not.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you in the passage when you noticed that person?
</p>
<p>How far down the passage had you got ?
</p>
<p>A. I noticed him in about the second stride I made after I heard
</p>
<p>the door slam. At the moment the door did slam, I had just passed
</p>
<p>one person ; and then one or two more, in a great deal of agitation,
</p>
<p>came out within the passage-way ; and I am sure that not more than
</p>
<p>two strides brought me in view of the door. The light being more
</p>
<p>dim, and my eyes just escaping from the foot-lights, I did not see
</p>
<p>so well ; but I could see the door there, and noticed this person.
</p>
<p>Of course, I passed the person, and could easily have put my hand
</p>
<p>on him.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you please mark on the plat or diagram already shown
</p>
<p>you the position in which you were when you saw that person?

</p>
<p>Put your initials on the plat at the spot, and indicate the position
</p>
<p>where that person stood.
</p>
<p>The Witness marked with his initials on the diagram, which is
</p>
<p>Exhibit No. 48, the point supposed by him to be the door which
</p>
<p>76 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>was slammed, bis own position at the time, and the position of the
</p>
<p>person near the door.
</p>
<p>Q. Please mark also the positions of the other persons that you
</p>
<p>saw in the passage, as near as you can.
</p>
<p>The Witness marked the positions as indicated by the question,
</p>
<p>and added, 
</p>
<p>I have made these marks as indicating, as near as I could form a
</p>
<p>judgment in such a rapid transit as I was making, the positions of
</p>
<p>the persons I met.
</p>
<p>Q. State as well as you can recollect whether the persons you
</p>
<p>saw there were gentlemen or ladies.
</p>
<p>A. I think the majority of the persons that I observed were
</p>
<p>ladies.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice Miss Laura Keene ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not particularly : I should find it difl&cult to have no-
</p>
<p>ticed particularly any of the ladies, unless I had some means of
</p>
<p>knowing them, or had my attention called to them, any more than I
</p>
<p>knew that they were there,  that they came out. All those persons,
</p>
<p>up to the point I described, were very much agitated,  seemed very
</p>
<p>much confused. I saw another person to the right, or rather caught
</p>
<p>a glimpse of him ; but that person was considerably in to the right
</p>
<p>of where the person was that I described as being near the door, and
</p>
<p>was moving.
</p>
<p>Q. Moving which way ?
</p>
<p>A. In on the stao;e.
</p>
<p>Q. Moving from the door?
</p>
<p>A. He was moving almost at right angles to my course, off to
</p>
<p>my right.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he moving away from the door, or getting nearer to the
</p>
<p>door ?
</p>
<p>A. He was moving away to the right,  not moving away from a
</p>
<p>straight line with the door ; but that person had not come from the
</p>
<p>door, or I would have seen him.

</p>
<p>Q. You mean, that, as he moved, he got farther from the door?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : farther from the door, and farther from me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice any person in the alley except the one who
</p>
<p>mounted and rode off?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 77
</p>
<p>A. As I passed out of tbe door, on the right side, a small per-
</p>
<p>son passed directly under my right elbow. I caught a glimpse of
</p>
<p>and rather felt the person. As I approached the horse at the nearest
</p>
<p>point,  I got to the horse before he was sheered around from the
</p>
<p>right to the left,  some one ran rapidly out of the alley.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it probably the person you noticed passing at your elbow ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : tliat person never passed me ; he was left behind
</p>
<p>me, wherever he went to.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you recognize that person if you saw him?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I could not. There was no light inside by which I
</p>
<p>could recognize him. The person, whoever it was, was a small
</p>
<p>person.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he as tall a person as the prisoner Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I should think, not by four or five inches.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you see whether the person who you now think was
</p>
<p>Spangler wore any whiskers or mustache at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. If he did, it was not prominent, and 1 did not observe it so
</p>
<p>distinctly ; and yet I am under the impression that his face was
</p>
<p>slightly bearded, but not to that prominent degree which would
</p>
<p>attract or fix or settle my attention much. The visage was what I
</p>
<p>took in,  the side-face, the profile.
</p>
<p>Q. Your impression is that his face was bearded ?
</p>
<p>A. Not prominently. I should have thought he had some beard
</p>
<p>on his face ; but you can imagine, if you ass6ciate your ideas with
</p>
<p>the attention I would be paying to any one who came near me, con-
</p>
<p>sidering the object I was about, how this thing would strike me.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think he had a mustache only, or a mustache and
</p>
<p>side- whiskers ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot undertake to say that there were any side-whiskers.
</p>
<p>I did not expect to be asked these questions : but I have always
</p>
<p>since then been under the certainty that I saw a person inside, near the
</p>
<p>door ; and, associating the appearance of that person, I have in my
</p>
<p>mind a certain profile, a certain visage, a certain appearance which

</p>
<p>rests in my conviction, and in my intelligence, as to the person I saw.
</p>
<p>Q. As to the mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. I am under the impression that there was some beard on the
</p>
<p>face ; but I would not undertake to designate a mustache. If there
</p>
<p>7*
</p>
<p>78 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>was one, it was not sufficiently prominent to make it marked in
</p>
<p>any way.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you recollect how he was dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you recollect the color of any of his clothing?
</p>
<p>A. I did not stop to take that particular notice. My recollec-
</p>
<p>tion on that subject is, that the person had on a gray or darkish suit.
</p>
<p>My recollection would be against its being a decidedly black suit.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner Spangler since then till now ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never saw him since then until to-day.
</p>
<p>Q. And you swear now simply to a mere impression, hardly a
</p>
<p>fixed opinion, as to his being the person ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not undertake to swear positively that that person sitting
</p>
<p>there was the person I saw. I do say that I saw a person there ;
</p>
<p>and I see no person among these prisoners who calls to mind the
</p>
<p>appearance of that person, except the one that I have indicated ;
</p>
<p>and that one, I am told, is Mr. Spangler.
</p>
<p>Q. I wish to know how strongly you are of opinion, or under
</p>
<p>the impression, that that was probably the man, or whether you are
</p>
<p>under that impression.
</p>
<p>A. I am decided in my opinion that the person now referred to
</p>
<p>resembles the person I saw there.
</p>
<p>Q. I believe you returned to the theatre, after you chased Booth
</p>
<p>up the alley ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You then came back to this door?
</p>
<p>A. I entered the same door that I had gone out of.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not recollect meeting the prisoner Spangler as you
</p>
<p>came back ?
</p>
<p>A. If I did, I did not notice him in particular. When I got out
</p>
<p>from the door, and from the time I reached the stage, I saw no one
</p>
<p>behind me ; nor did I see any person after I passed beyond the
</p>
<p>door, except the person on the horse, whom I believed to be Mr.

<p>John Wilkes Booth, until I had run as far as I did run after the
</p>
<p>horse, which was around the alley and up to the left some little dis-
</p>
<p>tance. I then turned and came back, and saw that nobody had
</p>
<p>come out from the theatre up to that time. I asked some of the peo-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 79
</p>
<p>pie in the buildings back if tbey had seen more than one horse there,
</p>
<p>and how long they had seen the horse there ; and I got some
</p>
<p>answers from them which occupied but a moment, and then went on
</p>
<p>into the theatre. One of the persons stated that he had seen one
</p>
<p>horse there ; and that was all they seemed to know. When I got
</p>
<p>inside the door again, I met four or five persons approaching the
</p>
<p>door, and, just at the door, one person, a policeman, a man with a
</p>
<p>police-mark on, and not this prisoner. Inside the door, a number
</p>
<p>of persons came against me. The persons rapidly accumulated on
</p>
<p>my observation, returning into the house : the stage, the scenes, and
</p>
<p>the passage-ways, were all filling up.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect asking, when you came in, who that person
</p>
<p>was ? or who it was that shot the President 1
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! I asked that question several times.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect this prisoner Spangler answering your ques-
</p>
<p>tion, saying it was Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not. I asked this question, and recollect that
</p>
<p>one person answered it,  "Are you satisfied it was Booth?
</p>
<p>have 3'ou any doubt it was Booth?" That was my belief ; and
</p>
<p>I was rather elicitino; the views of others. I would not undertake
</p>
<p>to say that he might not have been one of the persons who heard me
</p>
<p>ask the question, and, deeming it addressed to him, answered it ;
</p>
<p>but I am not aware of addressing any question directly to that
</p>
<p>person.
</p>
<p>Q. When you got out of the door, the person was just rising into
</p>
<p>his saddle, was he ?
</p>
<p>A. He was in his saddle, crouching forward ; his left foot was in
</p>
<p>the stirrup ; he was leaning to the left. The horse was moving
</p>
<p>with a quick sort of a motion, making apparently more exertion than
</p>
<p>headway at that time, but still going pretty fast, and circling around.
</p>
<p>He was sufiiciently mounted to go with the horse without being un-
</p>
<p>balanced : he was getting the horse under control very fast for a for-
</p>
<p>ward movement.

</p>
<p>Q. You cannot say, then, that he had just got into the saddle ?
</p>
<p>A. He was just completing his balancing himself in the saddle ;
</p>
<p>but I should form the opinion, from his position and the motion of
</p>
<p>the horse, that, the moment he got his foot in one stirrup, he spurred
</p>
<p>80 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>the horse, and, having the rein drawn more on one side than the other,
</p>
<p>for the moment lost control of him, so far as making^ him take a
</p>
<p>straightforward movement.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that all the persons you met in the
</p>
<p>passage, as you approached that door, exhibited signs of agitation,
</p>
<p>except this particular man?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; intense. Every person that came under my notice,
</p>
<p>in the brief space of two or three seconds that I ran through the
</p>
<p>stage, was greatly agitated, and seemed literally bewildered. The
</p>
<p>on]y person who did not seem to be under the same state of excite-
</p>
<p>ment was the person who was aear the door.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. How long did it take you, after you entered that passage, to
</p>
<p>get to the door '?
</p>
<p>A. I could hardly time myself.
</p>
<p>Q. You were running ?
</p>
<p>A. Just as hard as I could, and was only obstructed by the pass-
</p>
<p>ing of those persons. Of course, it could not have been long : it
</p>
<p>could not have been five seconds from the time I got on that stage
</p>
<p>until I reached that door. It was very quick. I realized in my own
</p>
<p>mind something wrong immediately on hearing the report of the pistol.
</p>
<p>I knew there was no pistol fired in the play : and then the discharge
</p>
<p>of the pistol was overhead ; and it was a charged pistol, in my opinion.
</p>
<p>It was discharged either by accident or design, of course ; and the de-
</p>
<p>sign was solved by the circumstance of a man jumping out with a
</p>
<p>dagger in his hand ; and the impression struck me instantly that there
</p>
<p>was something wrong. IMy impression was, that that person coming
</p>
<p>fi'om the President's box had assassinated or attempted to assassinate
</p>
<p>him. Every action which I performed and every effort that I made,
</p>
<p>after I started to get upon the stage, was acting under that convic-
</p>
<p>tion and impression to the last ; so much so, that I stated to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple in the tenement-houses in the rear, before I returned, that the

<p>person who went oflf on that horse had shot the President.
</p>
<p>Q. You saw only the side-face of the person neai* the door ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 81
</p>
<p>A. A profile ; but his full face passed around as you would see
</p>
<p>my own face now in turning from left to right.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to recognize, or to suppose you recog-
</p>
<p>nized, Booth when he alit upon the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. After I went out and returned, I took my family
</p>
<p>home, and immediately ran down the street towards Mr, Stanton's.
</p>
<p>I perceived persons in front of there, and then turned, and went rap-
</p>
<p>idly to the police-station, and gave my name, and the information I
</p>
<p>had, to Superintendent Richards, of the police, and, upon his question,
</p>
<p>said to him that I believed I knew who it was that had committed
</p>
<p>the deed ; that I believed it was Booth ; and he said he believed so
</p>
<p>too.
</p>
<p>Q. You had known him before by sight ?
</p>
<p>A. I had known him in this way : I had known him by sight ; and
</p>
<p>I was, some two years ago, one evening, at the Metropolitan Hotel,
</p>
<p>introduced to him. I had seen him on the stage ; and I had noticed
</p>
<p>him more during the last winter around the hotels. I went down
</p>
<p>two evenings to a hop at the National Hotel with some ladies, and I
</p>
<p>noticed him there leisurely around the parlor. I had not a doubt in my
</p>
<p>mind whom I was runnino; after when I ran over the stao;e ; and I
</p>
<p>should have been surprised to find it anybody else. I made every
</p>
<p>exertion to get through, and was astonished that the persons on the
</p>
<p>stage did not obstruct him ; but they seemed very much bewildered.
</p>
<p>I felt a good deal vexed at his getting away, and had no doubt, when
</p>
<p>I started on the stage, that I could catch him.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q, How long should you judge it to be from the time you heard
</p>
<p>the door slam until you saw the man balancing on his horse ?
</p>
<p>A, Not over the time in which I could make two steps.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you nearer the door when you heard it slam than the
</p>
<p>horse was on which was the man ?
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot determine ; for the horse was outside, and I

</p>
<p>was approaching the door through a passage-way that I had never
</p>
<p>been in before, and was only admonished of the position of the door
</p>
<p>by approaching it ; and the slamming of the door indicated to me that
</p>
<p>^
</p>
<p>82 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>there was a door slammed rigbt directly in front of tbe position I
</p>
<p>then occupied ; and I am sure it could not have been over the second
</p>
<p>stride after that. As the light reflected back along the passage-way,
</p>
<p>the door came in view ; and this person that I have desci ibed was
</p>
<p>in the position described, and turning towards me from the d 3or ; and,
</p>
<p>I suppose, in three strides more I was at the door.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you satisfied that the door was closed by some other per-
</p>
<p>son than the person who went out at the door ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot possibly be satisfied of that at all. There is nothing
</p>
<p>to exclude from my mind the possibility of the door having been
</p>
<p>closed by the person who went out,  by Booth himself ; but I did
</p>
<p>not see him close the door. The first notice of the door was on my
</p>
<p>ear, and in a moment it was in view. At the same moment, I perceived
</p>
<p>the person standing as I have described ; and the matter transpired
</p>
<p>then as I have stated in my observation.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you satisfied that the person you saw inside the door was
</p>
<p>in a position, and had the opportunity, if he had been disposed to
</p>
<p>do so, to have interrupted the exit of Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Beyond all doubt.
</p>
<p>Q. And, from his manner, he was cool enough to have done so?
</p>
<p>A. He showed no agitation like the other people did.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewixg :
</p>
<p>Q. Were not the other parties that you have spoken of also in a
</p>
<p>position to have interrupted the exit of Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. All of them?
</p>
<p>A. They were at the moment I saw them. They might have
</p>
<p>been two or three feet to the right or left in the scene-way before I
</p>
<p>saw them. Everybody I met could, if he had seen fit, have ob-
</p>
<p>structed my motion ; and, if those persons occupied the same position
</p>
<p>when Booth went through, they could have obstructed his motion.
</p>
<p>Q. That is all you meant to say ?
</p>
<p>A. One person only could not have obstructed my motion ; and

</p>
<p>that was the person who was apparently three, four, or five feet off to the
</p>
<p>right. I could have passed out the door without his obstructing me.
</p>
<p>That is the person whom I described, who seemed to be passing off
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 83
</p>
<p>to the right. All the other persons I saw could, and in fact did,
</p>
<p>obstruct my motion by their presence, but made no physical effort.
</p>
<p>Q. The person of whom you speak as being nearest to the door
</p>
<p>was in no better position to obstruct the movements of Booth, as far
</p>
<p>as you know, tlian any of the others ?
</p>
<p>A. None whatever, so far as I know.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not in a position which would be natural to a person
</p>
<p>who had run to see who it was was passing out, and who, as the door
</p>
<p>slammed, turned ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes. A person who had made an effjrt to discover that object
</p>
<p>would occupy that position.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. This man was nearest of all, though, to the door ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : nearest to the door.
</p>
<p>Q. And could have opened it, and gone out before you went out ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! It would have been but a step to the right, and a
</p>
<p>reach to open it : the door was immediately within the control of the
</p>
<p>person who stood there.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Bo you know whether the persons you passed in the passage,
</p>
<p>any of them, knew that the assassination had been committed ?
</p>
<p>A. That would be but a conjecture. They acted more like peo-
</p>
<p>ple who were astounded at something that had just occurred, without
</p>
<p>any means of knowing what their impressions were of the character
</p>
<p>of the occurrence : they were in that state of agitation.
</p>
<p>Robert Anson Campbell,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn , testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court where you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In Montreal, Canada.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you or not connected with the Ontario Bank of that city?
</p>
<p>A. I am first teller.

</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness an account headed, "Jacob Thomp-
</p>
<p>84 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>son in account with the Ontario Bank."] Will you look upon that
</p>
<p>account, and state to the Court whether or not it is a correct abstract
</p>
<p>from the books of that bank ?
</p>
<p>A. It is. I examined the account before I came away ; and these
</p>
<p>are the pajoers I brought along with me.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the account ?
</p>
<p>A. It is the account of Jacob Thompson with the Ontario Bank,
</p>
<p>Montreal.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state the day on which the account commenced?
</p>
<p>A. The account commences May 30, 1864 ; but, prior to this, he
</p>
<p>left sterling exchange drawn on the rebel agents in Liverpool, I think,
</p>
<p>for collection. As soon as that was collected, it was placed to his
</p>
<p>credit. The first advice we had was May 30, 1864 ; and that was
</p>
<p>2,061. 17s. lid., and 20,618. lis. 4d., amounting to S109,-
</p>
<p>965.63.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state when the account closed?
</p>
<p>A. The account closed April 11, 1865.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state the aggi-egate amount of the credits, and the
</p>
<p>ao;o;reo;ate amount drawn from the bank ?
</p>
<p>A. The aggregate amount of the credits is $649,873.28. There
</p>
<p>is a balance now still left to his credit of $1,766.23.
</p>
<p>Q. All the rest has been drawn out ?
</p>
<p>A. All the rest has been drawn out. He has drawn out lately,
</p>
<p>say since the first of March, about $300,000 in sterling exchange
</p>
<p>and deposit-receipts. He drew out a deposit-receipt at one time
</p>
<p>of $180,000; at another time, $100,000 in sterling exchange; at
</p>
<p>another time, $19,000.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state the amount drawn out between the 1st and 10th
</p>
<p>of April ?
</p>
<p>A. The first entry in April is on the 4th. That was a very
</p>
<p>small check,  $100. Then, on the 6th of April, there is a de-
</p>
<p>posit-receipt for $180,000. The banks in Canada give deposit-
</p>
<p>receipts,  I do not know whether you do here or not,  which are

</p>
<p>to be paid when presented^ upon fifteen days' notice.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Was that in one bill ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 85
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I am not sure about that, though. I did not draw
</p>
<p>it out, although the entries went through my hands ; but I think it
</p>
<p>was in one bill. Then he drew a bill, on the 8th of April, of 440.
</p>
<p>12s. Id. sterling ; and also one of 4,000 sterling on the same day.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of March, he drew $100,000 ; that is additional to the
</p>
<p>$180,000. The $100,000 drawn on March 24 was $100,000 in
</p>
<p>exchange ; while the 180,000 drawn on April G was on a deposit-
</p>
<p>receipt, not exchange.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. There are pencil-marks in the account. Explain what they
</p>
<p>mean.
</p>
<p>A. Those I put there myself, as memorandums in checking over
</p>
<p>the account.
</p>
<p>Q. Po you know Jacob Thompson personally ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes, sir ! I know him well.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, since the 14th of April last,
</p>
<p>he has left Montreal ?
</p>
<p>A. He has. I heard him say myself that he was going away.
</p>
<p>I know that he has not been since in the bank in Montreal. He
</p>
<p>used to come in the bank two or three times a week, whenever he
</p>
<p>had any business there ; and, the last time he was in, he gave a cheek
</p>
<p>to the hotel-keeper, which I cashed ; and he then left the hotel.
</p>
<p>His friends stated to rae that he was going to Halifax, overland.
</p>
<p>The navigation was not open at that time ; and I was told that he
</p>
<p>was going overland to Halifax, and then going to Europe.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you fix the date when that was ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not fix that.
</p>
<p>Q. He has disappeared, however ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes,!
</p>
<p>Q. Did he leave any thing to his credit when he went finally ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir: $1,766.23. It is entered to his credit now. This
</p>
<p>sterling exchange was drawn to his credit, and also the deposit-
</p>
<p>receipt ; or, if there was more than one deposit-receipt, they were

</p>
<p>all drawn to his credit : but I think there was only one.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that navigation was not open through the St. Law-
</p>
<p>rence when he left ?
</p>
<p>VOL. II. '8
</p>
<p>86 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it was not open then.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did it continue in that way ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, about two weeks longer. I know, at the time, I
</p>
<p>thouo;ht it stran2;e that he was o;oin2; overland, when if he had wait^
</p>
<p>ed two weeks longer, or about that time, he could have taken the
</p>
<p>steamer. That was the talk in the bank, at the time, among the
</p>
<p>clerks.
</p>
<p>Q. He was known to and recognized by the Ontario Bank
</p>
<p>as the ao;ent of the Confederate States ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : his account was just opened as " Jacob Thompson."
</p>
<p>Q. But still he was known as the agent of the Confederate
</p>
<p>States ?
</p>
<p>A. Outside people said so. I never heard him say what he
</p>
<p>was ; but it was the newspaper report that Jacob Tliompson was
</p>
<p>their financial ao;ent. We knew that he brouo;ht Southern sterling;
</p>
<p>exchange-bills drawn on their agents in the old countiy. How
</p>
<p>they came to him we did not know.
</p>
<p>Q. They were brought to your bank ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : to our bank for collection.
</p>
<p>Q. He did not seem to be engaged in any business in Canada
</p>
<p>requiring these large sums of money ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of. Part of the time he was residing in
</p>
<p>Upper Canada, and part of the time in Montreal.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any knowledge, derived during his transactions
</p>
<p>with the Ontario Bank, that he, and those associated with him, also
</p>
<p>had large money transactions with other banks in Canada ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! I know of one transaction of $50,000, I-think it
</p>
<p>was, that came through the Niagara District Bank. I am not sure
</p>
<p>about the amount.
</p>
<p>Q. Where is that bank situated ?
</p>
<p>A. At St. Catherine's. That was a check drawn to the order
</p>
<p>of Mr. Clay, and deposited by him in the Niagara District Bank ;
</p>
<p>and that bank sent it to us to put it to their credit. That was Aug.

<p>16, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean Clement C. Clay?
</p>
<p>A. Clement C. Clay.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know J. Wilkes Booth, the actor?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 87
</p>
<p>A. I had one or two transactions tliat I know of witli him.
</p>
<p>That is all I can remember at present.
</p>
<p>Q. How often did you see J. Wilkes Booth in Canada ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say. He might have been in the bank a dozen
</p>
<p>times ; but I remember distinctly of seeing him once.
</p>
<p>Q. He had a small account there, had he not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and still left to his credit four hundred and some
</p>
<p>odd dollars. I brouQ;ht a memorandum of it with me.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any knowledge how that credit arose? Was it
</p>
<p>from a deposit made by him ?
</p>
<p>A. From a deposit.
</p>
<p>Q. In specie, or in a bill?
</p>
<p>A. In notes. That did not go through my hands : it went
</p>
<p>throuo;h the hands of the second teller, the receivinoj-teller. I re-
</p>
<p>member there was $200 in $20 bills. The bar row says, " Davis's
</p>
<p>check on Merchants' Bank, $255 ; ten $20 bills " (Montreal bills),
</p>
<p>" $200 ; " altogether $455. That is the bar row of the bank, on
</p>
<p>the deposit memorandum.
</p>
<p>Q. Who is Davis?
</p>
<p>A. A broker who kept his office opposite the St. Lawrence Hall,
</p>
<p>just across the road. I am not sure whether he [Booth] was in-
</p>
<p>troduced by Mr. Davis or by Mr. P. C. Mai'tin.
</p>
<p>Q. AVhere is Davis from ?
</p>
<p>A. He is from the States somewhere, either from Eichmond or
</p>
<p>Baltimore : I am not sure which. When Booth came into the bank
</p>
<p>for this exchano-e, he bouo;ht a bill of exchano;e for 61 and some
</p>
<p>odd shillings ; and, at the time he bought the exchange, he said,
</p>
<p>*' I am going to run the blockade ; and, in case I should be captured,
</p>
<p>can my capturers make use of the exchange?" I told him no,
</p>
<p>not unless he indorsed the bill : the bill was made payable to his
</p>
<p>order. Then he said he would take three hundred dollars' worth,
</p>
<p>and pulled out three hundred dollars,  I think it was in Ameri-
</p>
<p>can gold,  and I figured up what three hundred dollars would

</p>
<p>come to at the rate of exchange,  I think it was nine and a half
</p>
<p>then,  and gave him sixty-one pounds and some odd shillings ; and
</p>
<p>he bought the bill of exchange. These are the only two transac-
</p>
<p>tions he has had with the bank, that we have any minute of.
</p>
<p>88 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to tlie witness the bills of exchange found on
</p>
<p>Booth's body.] Will you look at these bills of exchange, and see
</p>
<p>whether they are the same ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! these are the Ontario Bank bills of exchange :
</p>
<p>no doubt of that.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that that is the exchange you are
</p>
<p>talking about?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the date of the bill of exchange?
</p>
<p>A. Oct. 27, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not these drafts indicated that the
</p>
<p>disbursements were for use in the States generally ?
</p>
<p>A. W^e can never tell. We never ask a man any thing about
</p>
<p>that, A man doing business with us deposits what he likes ; and
</p>
<p>we never ask any questions. He draws checks for what he likes ;
</p>
<p>and we do not know what he is going to do with it, and do not ask
</p>
<p>him what he is going to do with it. The drafts in one or two in-
</p>
<p>stances were made payable to bearer. For instance, this one of
</p>
<p>Thompson's for fifty thousand dollars was not made payable to
</p>
<p>order. As a general thing, checks are not payable to order,
</p>
<p>but payable to bearer : but, in certain instances, " bearer " is
</p>
<p>scored out, and over *' bearer " they put " order ; " but it is very
</p>
<p>seldom done. Besides this exchange, Thompson has bought from
</p>
<p>us several times United-States notes,  greenbacks as they are com-
</p>
<p>monly called. -
</p>
<p>Q. In large sums?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir: on Aug. 25, he bought $15,000 in greenbacks;
</p>
<p>on July 14, $19,125 in greenbacks. That is in gold, you
</p>
<p>know.
</p>
<p>Q. You calculated it in gold?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I could not say what the amount of greenbacks
</p>
<p>was ; but that is what he paid for it in gold. At that time, I think,
</p>
<p>exchange was about fifty-five.

<p>Q. Did any of these transactions occur during the past spring?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : in March.
</p>
<p>Q. What date?
</p>
<p>A. March 14, $1,000 at 44|; for which he paid $552.50 in

<p>THE TRIAL. 89
</p>
<p>gold. Then, again, I find, that, on the 20th of March, he bought
</p>
<p>6,500 sterhngagam at 9^. Then he bought drafts on New York
</p>
<p>very often ; in several instances at least.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that a correct statement of the amount as it is on your
</p>
<p>books ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>[The account referred to was then offered in evidence without
</p>
<p>objection.]
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate stated that he was about to present for ex-
</p>
<p>amination a witness whose testimony would be of such a nature,
</p>
<p>that it was deemed important to prevent its publicity at the present
</p>
<p>time ; and he therefore suggested that the Court direct the enforce-
</p>
<p>ment of the sixth rule adopted for the government of its proceed-
</p>
<p>ings during the taking of such testimony : which suggestion was
</p>
<p>acquiesced in by the Court ; and the court-room was cleared of all
</p>
<p>persons, except the members of the Commission, the Judge Advo-
</p>
<p>cate and his assistants, the accused, their counsel and necessary
</p>
<p>guards, and the official reporters of the Court.
</p>
<p>After being in session with closed doors for some time, the Court
</p>
<p>adjourned until Monday morning at ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>IIONDAY, May 22.
</p>
<p>The Court met at the usual hour, ten o'clock, a.m., and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to the examination of witnesses. For reasons which were
</p>
<p>stated on Saturday, the same necessity still existing, the Court
</p>
<p>sat with closed doors. Afterwards the following testimony was

<p>taken :

<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as

<p>Q. Do you recollect, on entering the theatre, whether you turned
</p>
<p>to the right or to the left to get to the box you occupied ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I do not know which side I turned to.
</p>
<p>92 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Captain Edward P. Douerty,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Adtocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you had command of the
</p>
<p>cavalry that went from this city in pursuit of the assassin of the
</p>
<p>President, J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I had command of the detachment of the Six-
</p>
<p>teenth New- York Cavalry that captured Herold and Booth.
</p>
<p>Q. The circumstances of that capture have been fully detailed
</p>
<p>by other witnesses. I will ask you to mention the part you took,
</p>
<p>if any, in the capture of the prisoner Herold, and state to the
</p>
<p>Court all that he said on the occasion of his capture.
</p>
<p>A. There was considerable conversation with reference to the
</p>
<p>arms that were inside of Mr. Grarrett's barn. "We requested Booth
</p>
<p>to come out of the barn, and Herold also. Booth at first denied
</p>
<p>that there was anybody there but himself; but finally he said,
</p>
<p>*' Captain, there is a man here who wishes to surrender awful
</p>
<p>bad; " and Mr. Baker, one of the detectives who was there, said,
</p>
<p>"Let him hand out his arms." I stood by the door, and said,
</p>
<p>"Hand out your arms, and you can come out." Herold replied,
</p>
<p>*' I have no arms ; " and Mr. Baker said, " We know exactly what
</p>
<p>you have got." I said, " We had better let him out." Mr. Baker
</p>
<p>said, "No: wait until Mr. Conger comes here." I said, "No:
</p>
<p>open that door! "  directing a man to open the door: "I will
</p>
<p>take that man out myself." The door was opened ; and I directed
</p>
<p>Herold to put out his hands. I took hold of his wrists, and pulled
</p>
<p>him out of the barn. I then put my revolver under my arm, and
</p>
<p>ran my hands down him, to see if he had any arms ; and he had
</p>
<p>none. I then said to him, "Have you got any weapons at all
</p>
<p>about you ? " He said, " Nothing at all but this,"  pulling out
</p>
<p>a piece of paper, being a map of Virginia, which I put in my
</p>
<p>pocket. Just at this time the shot was fired, and the door thrown

</p>
<p>open ; and I dragged Herold into the barn with me. Booth had
</p>
<p>fallen on his back. The soldiers and two detectives, who were
</p>
<p>there, went into the barn, and carried out Booth. I took charge
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 93
</p>
<p>of Herold ; and, when I got him outside, he said, "Let me go
</p>
<p>away ; let me go around here : I will not leave ; I will not go
</p>
<p>away." Said I, "No, sir." Said he to me, "Who is that that
</p>
<p>has been shot in there in the barn ? "  " Why ! ' ' said I, ' ' you
</p>
<p>know well who it is." Said he, " No, I do not : he told me his
</p>
<p>name was Boyd." Said I, "It is Booth ; and you know it." Said
</p>
<p>he, " No : I did not know it ; I did not know that it was Booth."
</p>
<p>I took him, and tied him then by the hands to a tree opposite, about
</p>
<p>two yards from where Booth's body was carried, on the veranda
</p>
<p>of the house, and kept him tied there until we were ready to return.
</p>
<p>Booth in the mean time died ; and I sewed him up in a blanket.
</p>
<p>Previous to this, I had sent some cavalry-men for the doctor ; and
</p>
<p>we got a negro, who lives about half a mile from there, with a
</p>
<p>wagon, and put the body on board the wagon, and started for Belle
</p>
<p>Plain ; and the body was waiting my orders there.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did Herold say he had met this man ?
</p>
<p>A. He afterwards told me that he met him about seven miles
</p>
<p>from Washington by accident, on the night of the murder. I think
</p>
<p>he said between eleven and twelve o'clock that night.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not persist in saying that he did not know him at
</p>
<p>all?
</p>
<p>A. At first, he said he did not know him, and said that his name
</p>
<p>was Bovd.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state where they went after they met in 3Iaryland ?
</p>
<p>A. He told me that they went to Matthias Point, and crossed
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he mention the houses at which they stopped on the
</p>
<p>way?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not to my knowledge. Dr. Stewart was mentioned
</p>
<p>as one in whose house they were ; but whether he said so or not, I
</p>
<p>do not distinctly recollect.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Booth say any thing about Herold's innocence ?

</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate objected to the question; and it was varied
</p>
<p>as follows : 
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth say any thing further in reference to Herold ?
</p>
<p>94 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Booth said that he was the only guilty man or party, or
</p>
<p>words to that etfect.
</p>
<p>Q. Herold made no resistance at all, did he ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : excepting coming home, he said his feet were sore,
</p>
<p>and he could not walk ; and i procured a horse, and tied him
</p>
<p>on it.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Clampitt :
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Booth remark, " This man was innocent"? Was
</p>
<p>not this his expression ?
</p>
<p>A. He used words to that effect ; but I cannot swear those were
</p>
<p>the exact words he used.
</p>
<p>William E. Clever,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows :

<p>Arnold paid me the livery.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know any thing about the terms of the sale, or the
</p>
<p>circumstances of it?
</p>
<p>A. I do not : only Mr. Booth told me he had sold the horse to
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold ; and Mr. Arnold paid me the livery.
</p>

<p>A. Yes, sir ; and he paid me the livery on taking him away.

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When?
</p>
<p>A. John H. Sun-att used to hire horses from me to go down the
</p>
<p>country to parties in January last. I have the date on the book.
</p>
<p>I cannot recollect the time now.
</p>
<p>Q. With whom was he generally ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Booth ; and, after three or four visits down the country,
</p>
<p>Mr, Bootli left word that Mr. Surratt was to use his horse any time
</p>
<p>he thought proper, any time he came for him.
</p>

<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that Arnold bought the horse of Booth ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 97
</p>
<p>A. I do not know it ; only Booth told me so ; and I credited it to
</p>
<p>Mr. Ai'nold the next morning,  put the livery to him.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. You mean you charged the livery to Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and he afterwards called, and paid me $8.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever seen that horse in the possession of the pris-
</p>
<p>oner Atzerodt ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>Marshal James L. McPhail
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not the prisoner
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin has been in the rebel service ?
</p>
<p>A. He has, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was he in the military service of the rebels ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, about one year.
</p>
<p>Q. How long is it since he left that service ?
</p>
<p>A. He came into the lines about the time of the battles of Antie-
</p>
<p>tam and South Mountain. He came in at Martinsburg. I think it
</p>
<p>was in September, 1863, according to my recollection, that the bat-
</p>
<p>tle took place. That was the date, however, that he came in.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether or not he has taken the oath of allegi-
</p>
<p>ance ?
</p>
<p>A. He stated to me that he had taken the oath of allegiance at
</p>
<p>Martinsburg. In hunting the records of the Provost Marshal's of-
</p>
<p>fice this morning, before leaving home, I found the oath of allegi-
</p>
<p>ance of one Michael O'Laughlhi ; and, looking at the writing, myself
</p>
<p>and others concluded that it was his.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the date of that?
</p>
<p>A. June 16, 1863. I will state that Mr. O'Laughlin sent for
</p>
<p>me to correct what he said was an error. When he was first brought
</p>
<p>to my office, he stated that he had not reported. He sent for me to

</p>
<p>98 THE TRIAL,
</p>
<p>taken the oath of allegiance. This oath is dated at Baltimore, June
</p>
<p>10, 1863, and signed " M. O'Laugblin."
</p>
<p>Cross-examined bj Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. . Does it appear on the face of that oath that it was taken at
</p>
<p>Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Shall I read it ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>The witness read the oath, as follows : 
</p>
<p>Headquarters Middle Department,
</p>
<p>8th Army Corps, Office Provost Marshal.
</p>
<p>I, Michael O'Laughlin, do solemnly swear that I will bear true
</p>
<p>allegiance to the United States, and support and sustain the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution and laws thereof; that I will maintain the national sovereignty
</p>
<p>paramount to that of all State, county, or corporate powers, or any
</p>
<p>ordinance of same ; that I will discourage, discountenance, and for-
</p>
<p>ever oppose, secession, rebellion, and the disintegration of the
</p>
<p>Union ; that I disclaim and denounce all faith and fellowship with
</p>
<p>the so-called Confederate States and Confederate armies, and
</p>
<p>pledge my property and my life to the sacred performance of this
</p>
<p>my solemn oath of allegiance to the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States. And further : I will not attempt to trade, directly or indi-
</p>
<p>rectly, and have no business transaction whatever, with any person
</p>
<p>living in the so-called Confederate States. So help me God.

<p>Witness :
</p>
<p>E.. H. Marshall,
</p>
<p>Lieut, and x\sst. Provost Marshal
</p>
<p>M. O'Laughlin. [l.s.]
</p>
<p>Baltimore, June 16, 1863.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure that the statement he made with reference to
</p>
<p>Martinsburg did not refer simply to the point at which he came into
</p>
<p>the lines ?
</p>
<p>A. He stated to me that he came into the lines at Martinsburg,
</p>
<p>and there took the oath.

</p>
<p>Q. You are satisfied that he said he took the oath there ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 99
</p>
<p>A. That is what I understood him to say ; that was my under-
</p>
<p>standing.
</p>
<p>Q. He told you that he came into the lines there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; at Martinsburg.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you possibly be mistaken about his having said that he
</p>
<p>had taken the oath there instead of at Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. He sent for me to correct the statement he had made first to
</p>
<p>me, that he had not reported at Baltimore ; and he stated that he had
</p>
<p>come into the lines at Martinsburg, and there taken the oath. That
</p>
<p>is my recollection of it. It is customary, even in taking the oath of
</p>
<p>parties outside of the city, for them to report in the city when they
</p>
<p>arrive, or else they render themselves liable to arrest.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that oath signed by him ?
</p>
<p>A. This is signed " M. O'Laughlin."
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his handwriting ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen his handwriting; and, as I have stated, I believe
</p>
<p>that to be the handwriting. I have seen a good deal of it within
</p>
<p>the last two or three weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. You never saw him write, did you ?
</p>
<p>A. I think not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see any letters of his that he acknowledged to
</p>
<p>be his own ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen letters with his sio-nature, but none that he ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged to be his own. I had no conversation with him about
</p>
<p>letters.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox asked the Court to exclude the oath of alle2:iance sis-ned
</p>
<p>" M. O'Laughlin," produced by this witness, from the record, on
</p>
<p>the ground that the witness had not shown such a familiarity with
</p>
<p>the handwriting of the accused, Michael O'Laughlin, as to justify
</p>
<p>him in swearing that the signature to the oath was his genuine signa-
</p>
<p>ture.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate stated that he had not offered, and did not
</p>
<p>propose to offer, the paper in evidence.

</p>
<p>A. Only from liis own declarations.

<p>A. Oh, yes, sir !
</p>
<p>Q. Do his family reside, and have they resided, in Baltimore for
</p>
<p>some time ?
</p>
<p>A. They have resided in Baltimore within my recollection. I
</p>
<p>have known them, I suppose, for thirty years.

<p>Dr. T. S. Yerdi,

<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as

<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court what is your profession ?
</p>
<p>A. I am a physician.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, on the night of the attempted
</p>
<p>assassination of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State, you were called
</p>
<p>to his residence professionally ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was called by two servants from the house of Mr.
</p>
<p>Seward.
</p>
<p>Q. At what hour in the night ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect to the minute ; but it was probably half-past
</p>
<p>ten o'clock,  perhaps a little sooner.
</p>
<p>Q. On Friday night, the 14th of April ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state in what condition you found ]\Ir.. Emrick W.
</p>
<p>Hansell ?
</p>
<p>A. I found Mr. Hansell in th3 south-east corner, on the same floor
</p>
<p>with Mr. Seward, lying on a bed. He said he was wounded : I un-
</p>
<p>dressed him, and found a stab over the sixth rib, from the spine ob-
</p>
<p>liquely towards the right side. I put my fingers into the wound to
</p>
<p>see whether it had penetrated the lungs. I found that it had not ;
</p>
<p>but I could put my fingers probably two and a half inches or three
</p>
<p>inches deep. Apparently there was no internal bleeding. The
</p>
<p>wound seemed to be an inch wide, so that the finger could be put in

<p>Q. Had the stab the appeaiance of being just made ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was bleetling tlion, very fresh to all appearances.
</p>
<p>Probably it was not fifteen .or twenty minutes since the stab had

<p>occurred .
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the other persons in the house of Mr. Seward
</p>
<p>who were stabbed on that evening at the same time ?

<p>A. I saw every one of them.

<p>Q. Mention who they were. You need not describe their

<p>wounds.
</p>
<p>A. I saw the Hon. William H. Seward, Frederick Seward, Ma-
</p>
<p>jor Augustus H. Seward, Mr. Robinson, and Mr. Hansell.
</p>
<p>Q. They were all at that moment wounded, and their wounds
</p>
<p>bleeding ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I had left Mr. Seward about nine o'clock very com-
</p>
<p>fortable in his room ; and when I saw him next he was in his bed
</p>
<p>covered with blood, with blood all around him, blood under the bed,
</p>
<p>and blood on the handles of the doors. Miss Fannie Seward and
</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson were in the room.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Mr. Frederick Seward on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not he was sensible, 
</p>
<p>conscious ?
</p>
<p>A. He was sensible ; he was conscious ; but had great difficulty
</p>
<p>in articulating. He wanted to say something ; but he could not ex-
</p>
<p>press himself. He knew me perfectly well. He had a smile of
</p>
<p>recognition on his lips ; and, as I looked upon his wound on the fore-
</p>
<p>head,  it was on the forehead,  he was evidently impressed with
</p>
<p>the idea that the severest wound was in the back of the head ; and
</p>
<p>he commenced saying, " It is, it is;" and he would put his finger
</p>
<p>to the back of his head. I examined the wound, and found that his
</p>
<p>skull was broken ; and I said to him, " You want to know whether
</p>
<p>your skull is broken or not ? " and he said " Yes." He was sensi-
</p>
<p>ble for some time ; but probably in half an hour he went into a sleep

<p>from which he woke in about fifteen or twenty minutes, and we at-
</p>
<p>tempted to put him to bed. Then he helped himself considerably.
</p>
<p>We put him to bed, and he went to sleep, in which he remained for

</p>
<p>102 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>sixty Hours, and then improved in appearance, and gradually became
</p>
<p>more sensible.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you also give an opinion, after examining tbe wounds of
</p>
<p>tbe elder Mr. Seward, as to whether they were mortal or not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. When I saw Mr. Seward, I saw terror in the ex-
</p>
<p>pression of all bis family, evidently expecting that his wounds were
</p>
<p>mortal. I examined the wounds, and immediately turned round to
</p>
<p>the family, and said, " I congratulate you all that the wounds are not
</p>
<p>mortal; " upon which Mr. Seward stretched out his hands and re-
</p>
<p>ceived his family, and there was a mutual congratulation.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was that before Dr. Barnes made his appearance ?
</p>
<p>. A. Probably twenty minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. Was or was not Mr. Seward, at the time when this attack was
</p>
<p>made, in a critical condition ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. He had improved very much from a fonner acci-
</p>
<p>dent he had had, when his jaw was broken ; but he was evidently
</p>
<p>improving then.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what the effect of these wounds upon Mr. Sew-
</p>
<p>ard was, in reference to his former condition ?
</p>
<p>A. The effect, principally, was from loss of blood, which
</p>
<p>weakened him very much, and made his condition still more delicate
</p>
<p>and difficult to rally from the sljock. The wound itself created more
</p>
<p>inflammation in the swollen cheek,  the cheek that had been swollen
</p>
<p>by the injury received before,  and rendered the union of the bones
</p>
<p>more difficult.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not, at some time before this trial, stated that the
</p>
<p>wounds received by Mr. Seward had a tendency to aid his recovery
</p>
<p>from his former accident ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. That is an idea that got afloat from the fact that the
</p>
<p>cheek was very much inflated and swollen, and that, by cutting into
</p>
<p>it, it could probably recover faster ; but that was not my opinion,
</p>
<p>and I never expressed it.

<p>Q. It does not help a man who is injured to cut him over the
</p>

</p>
<p>A. Not much ; unless he has an abscess.

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know to whom he sold it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not know who he sold it to. He brought it

</p>
<p>A. I was there at one time.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who decorated it ?
</p>
<p>106 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I saw Harry Ford in there decorating it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see anybody else ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect seeing any person else in the box. There
</p>
<p>may have been some persons in there ; but I did not see them.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who put in that box, on that day, the rocking-
</p>
<p>chair on which the President sat ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not : I saw the colored man Joe Sims with it on his
</p>
<p>head. He was coming down from up in Mr. Ford's room, and going
</p>
<p>through the alley- way.
</p>
<p>Q. He was bringing it into the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that in the afternoon ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see who helped him to put it in that box ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen that chair in that box at all ?
</p>
<p>A. Not this season.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you ever seen it ?
</p>
<p>A. The first time the President ever came there, it was put in
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that?
</p>
<p>A. In the winter of 1863.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you had not seen it there for two years ?

</p>
<p>Q. Had you been in the box a few days before ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not been in that box since 1863.

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. What has been your business at the theatre ?

</p>
<p>Q. Do your duties require you to be on the siage while the per-
</p>
<p>formance is going on ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : if there is any thing to do. There is a great deal
</p>
<p>of work to do generally. Sometimes there is nothing at all, and I
</p>
<p>go out.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 107
</p>
<p>Q. What is your position on the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. To see that the furniture is put on there right ; to give the
</p>
<p>actors any side-properties that are required to use in the piece.
</p>
<p>Q. What place on the stage is yours ? What part of the stage
</p>
<p>do you occupy ?
</p>
<p>A. My room is not on the stage : it is off the stage. I do not
</p>
<p>occupy any part of the stage particularly.
</p>
<p>Q. You have no position on the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. No position on the stage proper.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the passage-way by which Booth escaped ?
</p>
<p>A. I was shown the passage-way. I did not see him escape that
</p>
<p>way.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state whether it is customary during a performance
</p>
<p>to have that passage-way clear or obstructed 'I
</p>
<p>A. It is generally clear. I have never seen it blocked up.
</p>
<p>When we are playing a heavy piece, we generally have to run things
</p>
<p>in there in a hurry. It is generally clear.
</p>
<p>Q. Is the " American Cousin " a heavy piece ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think, then, that, during the play of the " American
</p>
<p>Cousin," that passage through which Booth passed would properly
</p>
<p>be clear, with no obstruction ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was Spangler's position on the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. His position was on the left-hand side of the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. The same side that the President's box was on?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he has always been on that side since I have been
</p>
<p>about the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler that night?
</p>
<p>A Yes, sir : I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State at what times you saw him, and where he was during
</p>
<p>the performance.
</p>
<p>A. I saw him pretty nearly every scene. If he had not been

</p>
<p>there, I should certainly have missed him. I do not recollect of see-
</p>
<p>ing him away from the flats at all. He may have been away ; but I
</p>
<p>cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. If he had been away, you would have missed him ?
</p>
<p>108 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : because some person would have had to run his flat
</p>
<p>off; and every person would have been inquiring where he was.
</p>
<p>Q. If he had been away for what length of time ?
</p>
<p>A. If he had missed one scene, we should have known it. Some-
</p>
<p>times one scene lasts twenty minutes ; and a man can go a good
</p>
<p>ways in that time.
</p>
<p>Q. In the third act of the *' American Cousin," are not the
</p>
<p>scenes shifted frequently?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : there are seven scenes in it the way Miss Keene
</p>
<p>plays it.
</p>
<p>Q. Would it have been practicable for Spangler to have been ab-
</p>
<p>sent during the performance of that act ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it would not. He ou2;ht not to have been absent.
</p>
<p>Q. Would it have been practicable for him to be absent for five
</p>
<p>minutes, without his absence being noticed ?
</p>
<p>A. It would.
</p>
<p>Q. Ten minutes ?
</p>
<p>A. No : even five minutes' absence would have been noticed
</p>
<p>during the third act.
</p>
<p>Q. How was it during the second act ?
</p>
<p>A. I guess he has half an hour in the second act ; and, in the first
</p>
<p>scene of the third act, he has twenty-five minutes. After the first
</p>
<p>scene of the third act, the scenes are pretty quick.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at the front of the theatre during that play ?
</p>
<p>. A. During the second act, I was in the box-office.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you on the pavement ?
</p>
<p>A. I went through the alley-way to the front of the house. I had
</p>
<p>to go on the pavement.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler there ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Spangler wear a mustache?
</p>
<p>A. Not since I have known him ; and I have known him two
</p>
<p>years next month.

<p>THE TRIAL. 109
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler very shortly before that ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think I did. I saw him standing at his wing
</p>
<p>when I crossed the staf>;e with the will while the second scene of the
</p>
<p>third act was on.
</p>
<p>Q. You saw him in his place then?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was that before the President was assassinated ?
</p>
<p>A. I think that was about three or four minutes : it could not
</p>
<p>have been longer than that before ; but I will not say positively.
</p>
<p>Q. When you heard the pistol fired, did you see Booth spring
</p>
<p>upon the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him iiin across the stage?
</p>
<p>A. I first caught a glimpse of him when he was about two feet
</p>
<p>off the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you run after him ?
</p>
<p>A. I ran on the stage, and I heard a call for water ; and then I
</p>
<p>ran for water, and brought a pitcher of water, and gave it to one of
</p>
<p>the officers.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler after that ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see him after that until the next mornins:. I do not
</p>
<p>recollect seeing him at any rate. I may have seen him, but not
</p>
<p>have taken any notice of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Booth that night when he rode up to the theatre,
</p>
<p>and called for Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the President's box was locked, except
</p>
<p>when they were decorating it or when it was occupied ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I am very seldom ever in the front of the
</p>
<p>house in the daytime.

</p>
<p>Q. Do jou know whether any of the other boxes were occupied
</p>
<p>that niirht when the President sat in there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think any of them were.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know they were not?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I cannot say positively whether they were or not.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not think they were ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think they were ; bat I would not say positively they
</p>
<p>were not. I never took notice only first of the President's box, and
</p>
<p>saw that the President came in.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. When did you first hear that the President was coming to the
</p>
<p>theatre that nis-ht ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard it, I guess, about twelve o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Who told you?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Harry Ford.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the President was invited ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I heard that night that one of his young men,
</p>
<p>who were officers up there, came down and engaged the box for him.
</p>
<p>I heard him say so myself.
</p>
<p>Q. Heard who say so ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know what his name is ; but he is one of the detec-
</p>
<p>tives up there at the President's House,  a young man. I heard
</p>
<p>him say that night that he had come down that morning and engaged
</p>
<p>the box for the President.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. HI
</p>
<p>A. I was a prisoner in Pdclimond from the 3d of March, 1864,
</p>
<p>to the 16th of July, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. In what prison were you confined there ?
</p>
<p>A. During that time, I was in Libby Piison. I was, at other
</p>
<p>times, in different prisons.
</p>
<p>Q. Till what time did your imprisonment continue ?
</p>
<p>A. Until the 10th of December, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, during that time, you had occasion to
</p>
<p>observe and did observe that the Libby Prison had been mined by
</p>
<p>the Confederate authorities with a view to exploding it in the event
</p>
<p>of the capture of the place by our army. State what you saw.
</p>
<p>A. When we were first taken to Libby, we were informed, when
</p>
<p>taken into the hall, that the place had been mined. On the next
</p>
<p>morning, we were taken into a dungeon in the cellar part of the
</p>
<p>building. In going to the door of the dungeon, we had to go
</p>
<p>around a place where there was fresh du-t, in the centre of the cel-
</p>
<p>lar. The guard would allow no person to pass over it or near it.
</p>
<p>On inquiring why, we were told that that was the place where the
</p>
<p>torpedo had been placed. That remained there while we were in
</p>
<p>the dungeon, and for some time after we were taken up stairs.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have an opportunity of examining and seeing the
</p>
<p>torpedo ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; not while there. It was not opened while we were
</p>
<p>in the dungeon.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you learn that from the officers who accompanied you
</p>
<p>and had charge of you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. They said the torpedo was buried there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they speak of one or more ?
</p>
<p>A. One. It was always spoken of as the torpedo.
</p>
<p>Q. From the appearance of the grounds, of the place dug out,
</p>
<p>would you suppose it to have been a large or small torpedo ?

</p>
<p>A. The place had been dug out pretty large ; apparently fresh
</p>
<p>dirt with a diameter of six feet ; a little rise, as if the diit had been
</p>
<p>dug out, and put back again : it was not level.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that du-ectly under the prison ?
</p>
<p>112 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Directly under the centre of the prison.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they explain to you the object for which the prison had
</p>
<p>been mined ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Different ones in conversation told us that it had
</p>
<p>been rained on account of the raid with which I was connected, 
</p>
<p>Colonel Dahlgren's raid,  in case we should succeed in getting
</p>
<p>into the city, that, rather than have the prisoners liberated, they
</p>
<p>would blow them up.
</p>
<p>Q. The officers stated that was the purpose of it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel R. B. Treat,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State what your position is in the service.
</p>
<p>A. I am Chief Commissary of the Army of the Ohio.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you recently been on duty in the State of North Caro-
</p>
<p>lina?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not the army with which you were
</p>
<p>connected there captured a variety of boxes said to contain the
</p>
<p>archives of the so-called Confederate States ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : they were delivered by General Joseph E. John-
</p>
<p>ston to General SchoSeld at Charlotte, N.C.
</p>
<p>Q. State under what circumstances they were delivered, and with
</p>
<p>what declaration on the part of Johnston.
</p>
<p>A. I think a letter was sent from Charlotte to General Schofield
</p>
<p>at E-aleigh, from General "Johnston, stating that he had in his pos-
</p>
<p>session, at Charlotte, the records and archives of the War Depart-
</p>
<p>ment of the Confederacy, which he was ready to deliver on his
</p>
<p>sending an officer over to receive them. The following day, an offi-
</p>
<p>cer on the general's staff was sent to Charlotte, and received them,
</p>
<p>here.

</p>
<p>Q. To whom did jou deliver them here ?
</p>
<p>^ THE TRIAL. 113
</p>
<p>A. I delivered them to the War Department ; and I have in my
</p>
<p>possession a receipt of Major Eckert, acting Assistant Secretary of
</p>
<p>War.
</p>
<p>Q. Were any of those boxes labelled, and the contents indi-
</p>
<p>cated ?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A. The most of them were.

<p>Major T. T. Eckert
</p>
<p>recalled for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>By iho; Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you received certain boxes
</p>
<p>from Colonel Treat, purporting to contain the archives or records of
</p>
<p>the War Department of the so-called Confederate States.
</p>
<p>A. I did : I received them yesterday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Have any part of those boxes been opened ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. By whom ?
</p>
<p>A. They were opened by my direction ; I believe, by Mr. Hall.
</p>
<p>Q. The contents have undergone some examination by Mr.

<p>Hall?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>of boxes, delivered to you by Major Eckert, containing the archives

<p>of the War Department of the so-called Confederate States.

</p>
<p>[The letter thus identified was offered in evidence, and read as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>Montgomery, "^'hite Sulphur Sprin'GS, Va.
</p>
<p>To Ms Excellency the President of the Confederate States of
</p>
<p>America : 
</p>
<p>Dear Sir.  I have been thinkino; some time that I would make
</p>
<p>this communication to you, but have been deterred from doing so on
</p>
<p>account of ill health. I now offer you my services ; and, if you
</p>
<p>will favor me in my designs, I will proceed, as soon as my health
</p>
<p>will permit, to rid my country of some of her deadliest enemies, by
</p>
<p>striking at the very hearts' blood of those who seek to enchain her
</p>
<p>in slavery. I consider nothing dishonorable having such a tendency.
</p>
<p>All I ask of you is to favor me by granting me the necessary papers,
</p>
<p>&c., to travel on while within the joi-isdiction of the Confederate
</p>
<p>Government. I am perfectly familiar with the North, and feel con-
</p>
<p>fident that I can execute any thing I undertake. I am just returned
</p>
<p>now from within their lines. I am a lieutenant in General Duke's
</p>
<p>command ; and I was on the raid last June in Kentucky, under
</p>
<p>General John H. Morgan. I and all of my command, excepting
</p>
<p>about three or four, and two commissioned officers, were taken pris-
</p>
<p>oners ; but, finding a good opportunity while being taken to prison,
</p>
<p>I made my escape from them. Dressing myself in the garb of a
</p>
<p>citizen, I attempted to pass out through the mountain ; but finding
</p>
<p>that impossible, narrowly escaping two or three times from being re-
</p>
<p>taken, I shaped my course north, and went through to the Canadas,
</p>
<p>from whence, by the assistance of Colonel J. P. Holcombe, I suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded in making my way around and through the blockade ; but
</p>
<p>having taken the yellow fever, &c., at Bermuda, I have been ren-
</p>
<p>dered unfit for service since my arrival.
</p>
<p>I was reared up in the State of Alabama, and educated at its
</p>
<p>nniversity. Both the Secretary of War, and his assistant. Judge
</p>
<p>Campbell, are personally acquainted with my father, William J.

<p>all being in garrison, I desire that you favor me in this a short time.
</p>
<p>I would like to have a personal interview with you, in order to per-

</p>
<p>itself: very little of it concerns specially the individual prisoners
</p>
<p>here. Under all the circumstances, I hope the gentlemen on the
</p>
<p>other side will be willing to proceed with their testimony, leaving to
</p>
<p>us the right, if these witnesses should hereafter come in, to examine
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing [after consultation with the other counsel]. The
</p>
<p>counsel for the accused wish me to say to the Court that they prefer
</p>
<p>that the testimony for the prosecution be closed before the testimony
</p>
<p>for the defence begins.
</p>
<p>The President. Do I understand General Holt to say that
</p>
<p>there will be no more witnesses in attendance this evening ?
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. There will not be.
</p>
<p>The Commission then adjourned until to-morrow morning at ten
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>Tuesday, May 23, 1865.
</p>
<p>The Military Commission met at the usual hour.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken stated that if the Government found it inconvenient
</p>
<p>now to close its case, and the residue of its testimony was simply
</p>
<p>with reference to the establishment of the fact that a conspiracy did
</p>
<p>exist, and did not affect the prisoners arraigned before the Court, he
</p>
<p>was willing to go on with the testimony for the defence to-morrow,
</p>
<p>if the Court should sit then.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. I will state that some
</p>
<p>of the testimony will have special reference to some of the accused :
</p>
<p>very little, however. There are, perhaps, four or five witnesses yet
</p>
<p>as to special matters.
</p>
<p>The President. Where are those witnesses ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. Some of them are in
</p>
<p>Baltimore ; some of them are in the city, unable to get here : they
</p>
<p>cannot get across the military lines to-day.
</p>
<p>The President. I understand that there is provision at Four
</p>
<p>and a Half Street for everybody that has business at the Court.

<p>know that ; and they are stopped at other points.
</p>
<p>The record of yesterday was then read.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 117
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I beg leave to call the attention of the Court to
</p>
<p>the statement I made yesterday on behalf of the counsel for the
</p>
<p>accused. I stated, " The counsel for the accused wish me to say to
</p>
<p>the Court that they prefer that the testimony for the prosecution be
</p>
<p>closed before the testimony for the defence begins." I ask permis-
</p>
<p>sion of the Court to amend that statement by inserting after the
</p>
<p>word " prosecution " the words, " except that relating merely to the
</p>
<p>formation and general plans of the alleged conspiracy." In other
</p>
<p>words, the counsel for the accused are entirely willing that any testi-
</p>
<p>mony for the prosecution relating to the formation and general plans
</p>
<p>of the alleged conspiracy may be introduced by the Government at
</p>
<p>any time during the progress of the trial. We merely wish that the
</p>
<p>testimony relative to the accused on trial shall all be introduced
</p>
<p>before the defence is commenced.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. As far as we can, we
</p>
<p>intend to do that.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I very much doubt the practicability of
</p>
<p>securing the attendance of witnesses during to-day and to-morrow :
</p>
<p>the public offices are closed, and locomotion through the city is
</p>
<p>almost impossible. The public attention is so much riveted upon
</p>
<p>the grand review that is in progress, that I much question whether
</p>
<p>any thing will be accomplished here by attempting to continue the
</p>
<p>sessions of the Court to-day and to-morrow. The intermediate time
</p>
<p>may, perhaps, be profitably occupied by the counsel for the defence
</p>
<p>in making preparations, so as to be in better condition to proceed
</p>
<p>with the case when we meet on Thursday than they are now.
</p>
<p>This suggestion was acquiesced in ; and the Commission adjourned
</p>
<p>until Thursday next at ten o'clock, a.m.
</p>
<p>Thursday, May 25, 1S65.
</p>
<p>The Court met at the usual hour ; and the record of Tuesday last
</p>
<p>was read by Mr. D. F. Murphy, one of the official reporters, and
</p>
<p>approved.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. The Court will remember, that, on Tuesday last,

<p>Marshal McPhail produced a printed form of oath, and was about to

<p>118 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>bo in the handwriting of the accused, O'Laughlin. The printed
</p>
<p>report of Monday's proceedings represents me as having asked hira
</p>
<p>to read that oath ; which is a mistake. Furthermore, it appeared on
</p>
<p>cross-examination that the witness had not that knowledge of the
</p>
<p>handwriting of the accused which entitled him to testify as to it ;
</p>
<p>and, on that objection being made, the Judge Advocate stated that
</p>
<p>that paper was not offered in evidence. Still, it was read, and has
</p>
<p>gone into the record ; which, therefore, seems to be erroneous : and
</p>
<p>I do not know of any other method of correcting the error than by
</p>
<p>striking out all that part of the testimony which relates to that
</p>
<p>paper ; and I respectfully move the Court to have that done.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I think the gentleman is right, and the
</p>
<p>correction should be made.
</p>
<p>The President. Is there no objection to the proposed correc-
</p>
<p>tion ?
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I think not. The statement accords
</p>
<p>with the facts.
</p>
<p>The President. There being no objection, the record will be
</p>
<p>amended accordingly.

<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as

<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Samuel Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.

<p>Q. State whether or not, at the time of his arrest, you examined
</p>
<p>his carpet-sack.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you find in it ?
</p>
<p>A. I found some letters, papers, clothing, and a revolver, and

<p>some cartridges.

<p>wtiich I have on a memorandum, in regard to the number ; which I

</p>
<p>will look at if you will allow me. [After consulting his memoran-

<p>Q. Where and when was this examination of the carpet-sack
</p>
<p>made ?
</p>
<p>A. On the morning of the 17th of April last, at Fortress Mon-
</p>
<p>roe, at the storehouse of John W. Wharton.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the pistol loaded ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Q. And is so at this time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>out objection, and is marked Exhibit No. 65.]
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not at Old Point that you arrested Arnold ?
</p>
<p>A. I arrested him at the storehouse of John W. Wharton, near
</p>
<p>Fortress Monroe.
</p>
<p>Q. At Old Point?
</p>
<p>A. I believe that is the name of the place.
</p>
<p>Q. It was not in the fort ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You said that you have a memorandum of the number of that
</p>
<p>pistol. State it.
</p>
<p>A. The number is 164,557.
</p>
<p>Q. Who is the manufacturer ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not take the manufacturer's name.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Is it a Colt's navy pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. It is ; but I did not make that memorandum at the time.

</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you have been in the military
</p>
<p>service of the United States ?
</p>
<p>A. I have.
</p>
<p>Q. State in what command, and for what time you were in the

<p>service.
</p>
<p>A. I entered the military service in 1861 as a lieutenant in the
</p>
<p>Fifth Maryland Volunteer Infantry; and I served until the 31st
</p>
<p>of August, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. What position did you occupy ?

<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. I had.
</p>
<p>Q. During that time, were you or not a prisoner of war ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. In what prison or prisons were you confined?
</p>
<p>A. I was confined in Libby Prison, Richmond.
</p>
<p>Q. For what period of time ?
</p>
<p>A. I was confined there from the 15th of June, 1863, until the
</p>
<p>21st of March, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state where you were captured, under what circum-
</p>
<p>stances you were confined, the number of prisoners, and the treat-
</p>
<p>ment which they received from the hands of the Rebel Government ?
</p>
<p>A. I was captured near Winchester, about three miles and a
</p>
<p>half from Winchester, on the Martinsburg Road, on the 15th of
</p>
<p>June. I was then in General Milroy's command; and, at the
</p>
<p>time of my capture, I was in command of my regiment. I was
</p>
<p>captured by General Ewell's corps of the rebel army. I was
</p>
<p>taken from thence to Winchester ; and, on account of ill health, I
</p>
<p>was kept there two weeks in hospital. I was somewhat sick at the
</p>
<p>time of my capture, from excessive duty, exposure, &c. At the

<p>expiration of two weeks, my health somewhat improved. I was
</p>
<p>then compelled to march to Staunton in a feeble condition ; but, on
</p>
<p>the road, I was treated very kindly by the officer in charge of the
</p>
<p>squad. I arrived in Libby Prison, and was incarcerated there.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 121
</p>
<p>The rations we received there when I first arrived were small;
</p>
<p>but such as they gave us were tolerably fair at first. There was
</p>
<p>about one loaf of bread allowed to two men,  half a loaf per man ;
</p>
<p>and, I judge, about four ounces of meat, and about three spoonfuls
</p>
<p>of rice. That constituted the ration that we received at first. After
</p>
<p>I had been there about four months, the meat was stopped from us,
</p>
<p>and we then only received it occasionally. Then they took the
</p>
<p>bread from us, and gave us instead what they called corn-bread ;
</p>
<p>but it was of a very coarse character. I have known the officers
</p>
<p>there to be without meat for two or three weeks at a time, and re-
</p>
<p>ceive nothing but the miserable corn-bread that they gave us.
</p>
<p>Occasionally they would distribute some few potatoes, but of the
</p>
<p>very worst character, such as the men could hardly eat ; they being
</p>
<p>rotten, &c. This continued on for some time. The officers held a
</p>
<p>meeting there in regard to the treatment we were receiving ; and a
</p>
<p>letter was sent to General Ould, signed by Colonel Streight, I
</p>
<p>think, who was chairman of the meeting at the time, complaining
</p>
<p>of our treatment, and asking that we should receive better treat-
</p>
<p>ment. General Ould sent a written reply, stating that our treat-
</p>
<p>ment was good enough ; better than their prisoners were receiving
</p>
<p>in our prisons here,  Fort Delaware, and other places.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you mean Robert Ould, the man who is now in Libby
</p>
<p>Prison himself?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the rebel Commissioner of Exchange. Shortly
</p>
<p>after,  I suppose I had been there some five months,  I was
</p>
<p>taken sick with the dropsy, for the want of proper nourishment,
</p>
<p>proper diet, &c., and was quite ill, and was sent to the hospital. I
</p>
<p>remained there some few weeks. During my stay in the hospital,
</p>
<p>[ had occasion to see men brought in from Belle Isle to the hospital
</p>
<p>ivhere I was stationed, some half a mile, perhaps, from Libby Prison
</p>
<p>proper; and the condition of these men was horrible in the extreme.
</p>
<p>[ am satisfied, from their appearance, that they were in a starving
</p>
<p>3ondition. Out of a squad of forty, for instance, that were brought

<p>in, at least from eight to twelve died the first night they were
</p>
<p>brouo;ht there. I asked the assistant suro;eon in charo-e of the offi-
</p>
<p>3ers' department of the hospital,  I forget his name : he was very
</p>
<p>kind to us, though, and very much of a gentleman,  I asked him
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 11
</p>
<p>122 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>on one occasion what was tlie matter with tbese men. He stated
</p>
<p>that it was for the want of proper treatment ; that they did not re-
</p>
<p>ceive the proper treatment and noinishment that they ought to have
</p>
<p>for such men ; neglect, &c. That was about all he could state, I
</p>
<p>suppose, holding the position he held. I suppose I had been in
</p>
<p>that hosj)ital about two weeks when two of the ojBScers made their
</p>
<p>escape. Major Turner  who was a very passionate man, very in-
</p>
<p>sulting to the officers, always insulting in his remarks whenever he
</p>
<p>had occasion to speak to any of them, and very ungentlemanly 
</p>
<p>took it into his head to remove us from tbat place, and take us
</p>
<p>back to Libby Prison. He had a room washed out for us in Libby,
</p>
<p>and removed us to that room while in a wet condition, although
</p>
<p>some of the officers who were in the hospital were in a dying con-
</p>
<p>dition. We were placed in that wet room, and compelled to re-
</p>
<p>main there twenty-four hours, without cot, bed, or any thing else
</p>
<p>to lie upon, and without a morsel to eat, as a punishment because
</p>
<p>those two men had escaped. The treatment generally to prisoners
</p>
<p>was of a very harsh character.
</p>
<p>Q. Was this 31ajor Tui-ner of whom you speak the keeper of
</p>
<p>Libby Prison ?
</p>
<p>A. He was the commandant of Libby Prison.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any formal application made to him for an amelioration
</p>
<p>of the condition of the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. Colonel Powell spoke to him in regard to the treatment he
</p>
<p>had inflicted upon those men. Colonel Powell said he thought it
</p>
<p>was wrong to punish a parcel of sick and dying men fo.r the sake of
</p>
<p>two who had attempted to escape. His reply was, as near as I
</p>
<p>can recollect, " It is too damned good for you now."
</p>
<p>Q. Was the treatment of the men  did you notice that?  of
</p>
<p>the same character with that which the officers received ?
</p>
<p>A. The only opportunity I had of seeing the treatment of the
</p>
<p>men was the occasion I have spoken of, when they were brought to
</p>
<p>the hospital while I was there.

</p>
<p>Q. Was their condition that of emaciation, suffering for want
</p>
<p>of food ?
</p>
<p>A. It was, to the best of my opinion. Their appearance
</p>
<p>indicated it.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 123
</p>
<p>Q. You could very well judge, I suppose, from their conduct, if
</p>
<p>food at all came within their reach : what was their conduct then ?
</p>
<p>A. They appeared to be very eager to obtain something to eat ;
</p>
<p>and, although tottering and in a feeble condition, they would grasp
</p>
<p>at any thing that was oiFered to them in the shape of victuals. Their
</p>
<p>whole appearance throughout indicated that they were in a state of
</p>
<p>starvation.
</p>
<p>Q. This Belle Isle of which you speak was a place where
</p>
<p>Federal prisoners of war were confined ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the enlisted men were confined there.
</p>
<p>Q. You are satisfied that the prisoners of whom you speak,
</p>
<p>brought from there, died simply of starvation ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and neglect, the want of proper food, &c.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any pretence at all on the part of the rebel author-
</p>
<p>ities, in your conversation with them, that this treatment was the
</p>
<p>result of necessity, the want of provisions, or simply because they
</p>
<p>thought it was good enough for the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. It appeared to me, from all the information I could get from
</p>
<p>them, it was a matter of retaliation with them.
</p>
<p>Q. For what ?
</p>
<p>A. They said that their prisoners were treated in a worse
</p>
<p>manner than we were.
</p>
<p>Q. What proportion did the food actually received during this
</p>
<p>time bear to a ration, or what is necessary for the comfortable sup-
</p>
<p>port of life ? Was it one-half, one-third, or one-fourth ?
</p>
<p>A. A man could possibly live on what they gave us at first,
</p>
<p>although it was not near what we would call a full ration.
</p>
<p>Q. I speak of the subsequent months, when you say the meat
</p>
<p>was taken away, and nothing but this corn-bread allowed.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : a man could not possibly live on it any length of
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you describe that preparation which you called corn-
</p>
<p>bread ? What was it really ?

</p>
<p>A. It was corn meal and bran, I should think, mixed together,
</p>
<p> very coarse.
</p>
<p>Q. How was it cooked ?
</p>
<p>A. It was baked in a rough condition. Very often we just had
</p>
<p>124 THE TRTAL.
</p>
<p>to live on that anrl water alone for clays at a time. Sometiraes, as
</p>
<p>I said, they would furnish potatoes, or something like that; and
</p>
<p>occasionally they would be good ; but more frequently they would
</p>
<p>be in such a condition that we could not eat them.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. State if Major Turner, when you applied for proper rations,
</p>
<p>and more of them, answered to you that they were as good as you
</p>
<p>deserved.
</p>
<p>A. The communication was directed to General Ould, afterwards
</p>
<p>Commissioner of Exchange.
</p>
<p>Q. But aftei-wards, you said, you applied to Major Turner?
</p>
<p>A. Colonel Powell applied to him in regard to placing ns in this
</p>
<p>wet room, and keeping us there twenty-four hours, placing prisoners
</p>
<p>in a dying condition in a room of that kind ; and his reply, as near
</p>
<p>as I can recollect, was, that it was too damned good for us.
</p>
<p>Q. That was not inflicted upon you in the way of retaliation ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; punishment.
</p>
<p>Frederick Memmert,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you have been in the
</p>
<p>military service of the United States, and, if so, what position you
</p>
<p>held ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I held the position of captain for two years and
</p>
<p>ten months.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not, during that
</p>
<p>time, you were a prisoner of war, and, if so, where, and how
</p>
<p>long ?
</p>
<p>A. I was. I was taken at Winchester, Va., on the 15th of
</p>
<p>June, 1863 ; and exchanged on the 1st of May, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state the treatment which the Federal prisoners
</p>
<p>received in Libby Prison while confined there, so far as it came

</p>
<p>under your observation ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 125
</p>
<p>A. It was awful treatment.
</p>
<p>Q. Cannot you state the amount and character of the food, and
</p>
<p>the treatment generally ?
</p>
<p>A. When we came there first, we had half a loaf of wheat-bread,
</p>
<p>and between three and four ounces of meat and two tablespoonfuLs
</p>
<p>of rice. That was continued for about four months ; but, after that,
</p>
<p>the treatment was so bad, that we had a meeting, and sent a com-
</p>
<p>munication to Judge Quid on the subject. Colonel Streight was
</p>
<p>president of that meeting ; and Colonel Irvine, who was afterwards
</p>
<p>our Assistant Exchange Commissioner, was secretary. We sent a
</p>
<p>communication to Judge Ould about it, which he sent to Secretary
</p>
<p>Seddon. We received an answer back that they could do nothing
</p>
<p>for us ; that it was good enough for Yankees ; that their prisoners
</p>
<p>stated that they were treated just as bad as we were ; and that they
</p>
<p>could not help us in any way. Then we sent another communica-
</p>
<p>tion, asking them to give us our money. They had taken our
</p>
<p>money away from us when we came to Libby. I had mine
</p>
<p>hid under my shoulder-straps, and kept it ; but the others had
</p>
<p>to give theirs up. We sent another communication, asking them to
</p>
<p>give us our money, so that we could get something to buy our food
</p>
<p>with ; but they would not do that.
</p>
<p>Q. They kept the money, did they ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. After that, was the small meat ration continued or discon-
</p>
<p>tinued ?
</p>
<p>A. We often had no meat for twenty days. They gave us four
</p>
<p>ounces of fresh meat and half a loaf of bread for about four
</p>
<p>months ; but afterwards they stopped the meat for about five or six
</p>
<p>days, and gave us bread and water, a little beans, and rice.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of bread was it ?
</p>
<p>A. It was wheat-bread at first, and then we got corn-bread, 
</p>
<p>half a loaf of corn-bread,  about ten ounces, I guess, after that.
</p>
<p>When I left the Libby, we had had nothing but corn-bread and

<p>water for twenty days.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the condition of the prisoners? Were they
</p>
<p>greatly reduced, emaciated, by this treatment ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; very. A great many of them had the scurvy.
</p>
<p>11*
</p>
<p>126 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the bearing of the keepers of the prison towards
</p>
<p>you ? Was it kind, or rude and insulting?
</p>
<p>A. It was very rough. They abused us in every way they
</p>
<p>could.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at any time in the hospitals?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I went in there two or three times when our lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant-colonel died. I went in there to see him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the condition of the prisoners brought to the
</p>
<p>hospital ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was it?
</p>
<p>A. They looked awfal. I cannot find any word to describe how
</p>
<p>they looked.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it understood that their condition was the result of
</p>
<p>starvation, or what ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; starvation. After the battle of Chickamauga, they
</p>
<p>brought the wounded in from the West ; and I saw some fifteen or
</p>
<p>sixteen amputated cases placed on a cart, and a rope tied around
</p>
<p>them, so that they could not fall off; and they were carried in
</p>
<p>that way from the depot to the hospital, and right opposite Libby,
</p>
<p>not more than about a thousand yards, I guess. They had twenty
</p>
<p>or twenty-five ambulances there, and did not use them.
</p>
<p>Q. You say they had a great many ambulances not in use ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. But they put these prisoners, fifteen or sixteen of them, in a
</p>
<p>cart, and tied them with a rope, as they would sacks of- grain?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your condition when you left there ?
</p>
<p>A. I had the scurvy so bad, that I could hardly walk ; and I
</p>
<p>have been sick ever since I left Libby, pretty much. I had to lie
</p>
<p>on the floor a long while, and could not get up.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever entirely recovered ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I am recovered : but I still feel it. I have not

</p>
<p>the strength any more that I used to have.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of any application having been made, by your-
</p>
<p>self or others, to Turner, the keeper of the prison, for an ameliora-
</p>
<p>tion of the condition of the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 127
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : we spoke to him several times when he came up to
</p>
<p>the piison. He very seldom came up. We spoke to him, and also
</p>
<p>spoke to a committee from their Senate. Tliey were appointed to
</p>
<p>go into Libby, and examine our condition. They reported back
</p>
<p>favorably, although we showed them the bread we got, and told
</p>
<p>tijem we received no meat or any thing else.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you showed your food to that committee from the
</p>
<p>rebel Senate ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What reply did you receive ?
</p>
<p>A. They did not say any thing,  only walked through, and did
</p>
<p>not notice us at all.
</p>
<p>Q. What did Turner say in the conversations in reply to these
</p>
<p>complaints that you were all dying for want of food ?
</p>
<p>A. I went to Turner once, and told hun I wanted to get some
</p>
<p>medicine ; that the doctor would not give me any, and said he had
</p>
<p>not any ; that I was getting worse, and could hardly walk. He
</p>
<p>said, "You cannot have any: it don't make any difference to
</p>
<p>me. Wliat the hell have I got to do with it? " I told him that I
</p>
<p>must have some medicine ; that I had nothing to eat, and no money
</p>
<p>any more to buy any thing ; and he said, ' ' That is ^ood enough
</p>
<p>for Yankees."
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, or any of those men in authority, ever say to you iu
</p>
<p>effect that the object of this treatment was to kill the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Which one of them said that to you?
</p>
<p>A. Dick Turner told us.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a brother of the keeper of the prison ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he is no brother.
</p>
<p>Q, Was he in authority there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was an inspector.
</p>
<p>Q. Was this said in reply to your remonstrance?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Q. State his language, if you can.
</p>
<p>A. We told him how the thing was,  that we did not get any

</p>
<p>prisoners are just as badly treated by your fellows as you are

</p>
<p>tured.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that ?
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Will you state how long after your capture you continued a
</p>
<p>prisoner of war, and at what point or points you were confined ?
</p>
<p>A. Five months and seven or eight days, I think, at Belle Isle,
</p>
<p>and seven days at Scott's building.
</p>
<p>Q. What number of prisoners were confined there with you ^at

<p>Q. What opportunities had you for cooking? Was fuel fur-
</p>
<p>ciished to you ?
</p>
<p>A. It was cooked for us.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the effect of this system of starvation on the
</p>
<p>health of the men ?
</p>
<p>A. Not having fuel enough to warm us, and not enough pro-
</p>
<p>dsions to live on, I saw the men freeze to death on the island during
</p>
<p>the time I was there. I saw them starve to death ; and, more than
</p>
<p>bhat, I saw them afterwards lie for eight or nine days outside of the
</p>
<p>Intrenchments where we were kept in, and the hogs ate them.
</p>
<p>Q. Not even burying them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : they would not allow us to bury them. I have seen
</p>
<p>their bodies lie there from seven to nine days, to the best of my
</p>
<p>knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that treatment the subject of remonstrance on your
</p>
<p>part ?
</p>
<p>A. It was. I spoke to Lieutenant Bossieux, who had charge of
</p>
<p>the island, about the treatment, and he told me he had nothing to
</p>
<p>do with it ; that he had his orders from Major Turner.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Major Turner the keeper of the Libby Prison?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say this treatment was in accordance with these
</p>
<p>orders ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you say they positively refused permission to bury the
</p>
<p>dead?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; for I asked myself as a favor to bury our prisoners.

</p>
<p>Q. Did they die in large numbers?
</p>
<p>A. I helped to carry out there from ten to fifteen and twenty a
</p>
<p>day. More than that, I saw them shot down there without cause
</p>
<p>or provocation.
</p>
<p>130 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not their deaths, in your opinion, were
</p>
<p>caused mainly by starvation.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : to the best of my knowledge, I should judge so.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any proposition made by the prisoners to the rebel
</p>
<p>authorities to support themselves, if they would allow them to pro-
</p>
<p>cure provisions ?
</p>
<p>A. I think there was : I will not say that certainly ; but there
</p>
<p>were a great many men who volunteered their services to work to get
</p>
<p>something to eat,  numbers of them. They offered to work at
</p>
<p>shoemaking, and building a furnace there on the island.
</p>
<p>Q. You say one-half of those prisoners in the depth of winter
</p>
<p>slept out on the open sand, without any shelter whatever, and with-
</p>
<p>out any fuel to warm them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I lay there two months without ever putting my
</p>
<p>head under shelter. When I caine home, I weighed one hundred
</p>
<p>and twenty-three pounds.
</p>
<p>Q. What is your ordinary weight in health ?
</p>
<p>A. About one hundred and seventy or one hundred and eighty
</p>
<p>pounds. I do not know that I could have lasted a month longer
</p>
<p>there. I was pretty near gone when I came home.
</p>
<p>No cross-examination.
</p>
<p>William Ball,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you been in the mihtary service of the United
</p>
<p>States ?
</p>
<p>A. I enlisted in April, 1862.
</p>
<p>Q. When were you captured by the enemy ?
</p>
<p>A. On the seventeenth day of May, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you a prisoner of war ?
</p>
<p>A. About eleven months and twenty-three days.
</p>
<p>Q. State where you were confined during that time.

<p>A. At Anderson ville, Ga.
</p>
<p>Q. How many prisoners of wai* were there at the time you were
</p>
<p>at Audersonville ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 131
</p>
<p>A. I think altogether there was in the neighborhood of thirty-two
</p>
<p>housand. There might have been a few over that ; but I am not
</p>
<p>certain.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what treatment they received from the rebel
</p>
<p>luthorities while there ?
</p>
<p>A. It was very poor indeed ; no shelter whatever. They were
</p>
<p>turned into a swamp, with no shelter. They were stripped of all
</p>
<p>;heir clothing, blankets, and such stuff, money, hats, caps, shoes,
</p>
<p>ind whatever they had.
</p>
<p>Q. You say their clothing, their blankets, and their money, were
</p>
<p>;aken from them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You say the encampment where they were was a swamp ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir,  a side-hill on each side, and a swamp in the
</p>
<p>centre.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it without shelter or trees ?
</p>
<p>A. No shelter ; no trees : it was in the open sand.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not there was woodland in that vicinity.
</p>
<p>A. There was plenty of pine-wood about there,  any quantity
</p>
<p>3f it.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state the character of the provisions that were served
</p>
<p>[)Ut?
</p>
<p>A. Every morning, between nine and ten, they would bring a
</p>
<p>wagon with corn-meal grourtd up, cobs and all, full of stones and
</p>
<p>Dne thing and another, and give each man half a pint, and two
</p>
<p>ounces of bacon, and half a spoonful of salt, which was to last for
</p>
<p>twenty-four hours.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the character of the bacon?
</p>
<p>A. It was alive.
</p>
<p>Q. It was rancid, rotten ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Once in a while we would get hold of a good
</p>
<p>piece ; but not very often, though.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the effect of this treatment upon the health of the

</p>
<p>prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. It was very bad. It killed them off pretty rapidly. The
</p>
<p>most that died in one day was a hundred and thirty-three. They
</p>
<p>averaged from sixty to a hundred deaths every day.
</p>
<p>132 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not perfectly understood that these deaths were ocear
</p>
<p>sioned by starvation ?
</p>
<p>A. It was.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any remonstrance addressed to the rebel authorities
</p>
<p>by the prisoners in regard to this condition of things ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think there was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any statement which they made on that sub-
</p>
<p>ject ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes !
</p>
<p>Q. What did they say?
</p>
<p>A. They said they did not care a damn whether the Yankees
</p>
<p>died or not : they did the best they could for them. That is all I
</p>
<p>ever heard said.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether a man by the name of Howell
</p>
<p>Cobb once visited Andersonville ?
</p>
<p>A. I do. He made a speech there. It was some time in Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he the man who was formerly Secretary of the Treasury
</p>
<p>here ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember the tone of that speech, or what he said in
</p>
<p>reference to our prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. He made some very bitter remarks. I do not know that I
</p>
<p>recollect exactly now the statements he made.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they or not in support of the policy and treatment
</p>
<p>pursued towards our prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. He said that was the best they could do for them ; and if the
</p>
<p>authorities liked to do more, they probably could do better ; but they
</p>
<p>did not seem to care much about it. He did not say more than a
</p>
<p>few words. That was all he brought in about the prisoners there.
</p>
<p>He did not seem to care much about it.
</p>
<p>Q. You say they died at the rate of nearly a hundred a day ?
</p>
<p>A. I think the most that died in one day was on the 9th of

<p>September,  a hundred and thirty-three.
</p>
<p>Q. They were in the open sun : was the heat very strong ?
</p>
<p>A. Very intense indeed.
</p>
<p>Q. How was the water ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 133
</p>
<p>A. Very poor. You could get water by digging down half a
</p>
<p>foot : but there was a place a little way above, into which they threw
</p>
<p>all the dirt and slops that came from Andersonville ; and we were
</p>
<p>oblio-ed to drink that.
</p>
<p>Q. You were obliged to drink the water that was filtered through
</p>
<p>all this garbage ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you regard that as a necessary arrangement on their
</p>
<p>part, or as specially designed ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. They did not seem to care. They always
</p>
<p>threw every thing into the creek above. The men inside got up a
</p>
<p>committee, and sent it out to Wurtz ; and he said he did not care a
</p>
<p>damn whether the water got through or not, or whether we got any
</p>
<p>or not. He was in command of the interior of the prison.
</p>
<p>Q. How was the treatment in other respects, so far as the bear-
</p>
<p>ing of the sentinels was concerned ? Were any prisoners shot by
</p>
<p>them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : they would average, when I first went there, in
</p>
<p>June, as high as six or eight a day.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they seem to be shot from wantonness or any neces-
</p>
<p>sity V
</p>
<p>A. If a man would stick his nose over the dead line, or half a
</p>
<p>foot of it, he would be shot. It was said they got thirty days'
</p>
<p>furlouo;h for shootino; a Yankee.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear the shooting of any of them rebuked by
</p>
<p>the rebel authorities ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it or not understood that the sentinels were rewarded
</p>
<p>for shooting the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. As far as I understood, it was so.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether Howell Cobb, in his speech,
</p>
<p>referred to the emissaries of the rebels that were in the North
</p>
<p>enp-ao-ed in makinoj raids or firinjj; our cities ?

</p>
<p>burn and plunder the Northern cities. I cannot bring in the exact
</p>
<p>words he said.

<p>134 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the treament of our prisoners when they were sick
</p>
<p>in hospital 'i
</p>
<p>A. Very poor indeed. All they would give them there was
</p>
<p>pitch-pine pills for the diarrhoea, and pitch-pine pills for the scurvy
</p>
<p>or headache and every thing else. They would get no medicine at
</p>
<p>all. Medicine was sent there by the Confederate Government, and
</p>
<p>it was sold by the doctor in charge for greenbacks.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the money of the prisoners, or any
</p>
<p>part of it, was ever returned to them?
</p>
<p>A. Not a cent.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your own experience in regard to taking your
</p>
<p>clothes and money?
</p>
<p>A. When I was first captured, they took my shoes off, and I
</p>
<p>walked on the pike from near Waterford to Gordonsville ; and they
</p>
<p>took my money and clothes. I had nothing but a pair of drawers
</p>
<p>and a shu't for nine months in Andersonville.
</p>
<p>Q. They never returned you any thing ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not a thing. I lay there in the open field for nine
</p>
<p>months without a bit of shelter.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that a common experience ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. There were thousands there in the same fix. A
</p>
<p>man would die there in the morning, and by night nobody could go
</p>
<p>within fifty feet of him. They had to take long wooden pitch-
</p>
<p>forks, and put them into the wagons in that way, and caiTy them
</p>
<p>ofi" and put them in the trenches.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any reason why the clothing of the prisoners
</p>
<p>was taken away ?
</p>
<p>A. Because they wanted it for their own use. I would like
</p>
<p>also to state that there was clothing sent there by our Government ;
</p>
<p>and Captain Wurtz took it himself, and put it into his own house,
</p>
<p>and sold it,  blankets, pants, socks, and other things.

<p>By the Judge x\dvocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Was Captain Wurtz a rebel captain ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He was in command of the interior of the prison.
</p>
<p>Colonel Gibbs was in command of the post.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 135
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Was the character of the provisions served out to you such
</p>
<p>that a man would not eat them unless he was in a starving con-
</p>
<p>dition ?
</p>
<p>A. I would not think of such a thing as eating what was given
</p>
<p>to me ; but a man in a state of starvation would have to eat it.
</p>
<p>Q. That was the only thing that led them to eat what they got,
</p>
<p>because they were starving ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think it would be possible long to sustain human
</p>
<p>life on that amount and character of food ?
</p>
<p>A, I do not think a man could live a good while on it. A
</p>
<p>number died there. Up to the date that I left, which was on the
</p>
<p>24th of March, sixteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-five
</p>
<p>had died. That was the number that I took from the books myself.
</p>
<p>When I left there, about fifteen hundred were not able to be
</p>
<p>moved.
</p>
<p>Q. What proportion of them, in your judgment and the judg-
</p>
<p>ment of other prisoners, died from starvation and this treatment ?
</p>
<p>A. I have no doubt that over half of them did. It was the
</p>
<p>rations they got that brought them to their sickness ; and, after
</p>
<p>they wdre sick, they could not eat this stuff', and, of course, they
</p>
<p>starved. It was pretty hard for a man to eat it anyhow.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any medical treatment given to prisoners who
</p>
<p>were sick there ?
</p>
<p>A. A^ery little indeed.
</p>
<p>Q, Nothing of any benefit?
</p>
<p>A. Not any benefit at all.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. What were the pills of which you spoke ?
</p>
<p>A. Pitch-pine  a stuff" that runs out of the trees there  and a

</p>
<p>Q. Was that all they had ?

</p>
<p>A. Once in a while they would get a little medicine, and some
</p>
<p>would get it.

<p>Erastus W. Koss,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>Bv the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you have been in the service
</p>
<p>of the Rebel Government ?
</p>
<p>A. I never was in the army. I was clerk at the Libby Piison.
</p>
<p>I was detailed by the Conscript Board.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you or not a clerk there in the month of March,
</p>
<p>1864?
</p>
<p>A. I was,
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember that about that time General Kilpatrick
</p>
<p>was makino; a raid in the direction of Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State what knowledge, if any, you have of Libby Prison
</p>
<p>having at that time been mined by the Confederate authorities.
</p>
<p>State all the cux-umstances known to you.
</p>
<p>A. I never saw the powder myself. I saw the place where they
</p>
<p>said the powder was buried. They put it there in the night. They
</p>
<p>did it secretly. I never saw the powder at all ; but I saw the fuze.
</p>
<p>They kept the fuze in the office in the safe. I was not aware of it
</p>
<p>until the next morning. I was away that night at my uncle's. I
</p>
<p>came back next morning, and one of the colored men at the prison
</p>
<p>told me that some powder had been put in the middle building. I
</p>
<p>went up to roll-call in the morning ; and, when I went up in the
</p>
<p>buildinor, the officers asked me if the powder was there. I told
</p>
<p>them I was not certain it was there or not : all I knew about it was
</p>
<p>what the colored man told me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the place ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw the place frequently. There were two sentinels over
</p>
<p>it to prevent any person approaching it.

<p>Q. What was the size of the excavation made ?

</p>
<p>the earth thrown up loosely on it.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 137
</p>
<p>Q. You say the fuze by wticli this was to he set off was kept in
</p>
<p>the office ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : in the office.
</p>
<p>Q. In whose charge ?
</p>
<p>A. Major Turner, the commandant of the prison, had charge of
</p>
<p>it. It was an eight-inch fuze.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you that it was the fuze connected with the
</p>
<p>powder ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he told me the powder was there, and that this
</p>
<p>fuze was to set it off.
</p>
<p>Q. In what event was the explosion to take place ?
</p>
<p>A. He said they put it there for the security of the prisoners ;
</p>
<p>and, if our army should have gotten in, they were to set it off.
</p>
<p>Q, For the purpose of blowing up the prison and the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A, That must have been their intention.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did the powder remain there ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was taken up in May. They took it out secretly.
</p>
<p>When they took it out, they shut up the whole building ; and I do
</p>
<p>not know any thing about it.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know why it was taken out secretly ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether the knowledge that it was removed
</p>
<p>was concealed from i\\Q; prisoners themselves ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. There were no prisoners in the building
</p>
<p>when it was taken out. The prisoners had then all been sent to
</p>
<p>Macon, Ga.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand by whose authority that powder was put
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I was never aware by whose authority it was put
</p>
<p>there ; but I presume it was by General Winder or the Secretary
</p>
<p>of War.

<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you have been in the

<p>Q. State whether or not you were on duty at Libby Prison in
</p>
<p>March, 18G4, and, if so, in what capacity.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I had been detailed to post duty in Richmond to

<p>was on duty there at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what knowledge, if any, you have of Libby
</p>
<p>Prison being mined about that time by the Confederate authorities ?
</p>
<p>A. jMajor Turner, the keeper of the prison, told me that he was
</p>
<p>going to see General Winder about the guard,  I think we had
</p>
<p>no relief that day; the troops having been sent out of town,  and
</p>
<p>he returned, and told me that General Winder himself had been to
</p>
<p>see the Seci"etary of War, and that they were going to pat powder
</p>
<p>under the prison. In the evening of the same day, the powder
</p>
<p>came there, two twenty-five pound kegs, and a box. The box, I
</p>
<p>supposed, contained about as much as the two kegs.
</p>
<p>Q. IMaking about one hundred pounds ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. I think I am rio-ht about the size of the keo-s.

<p>There was a hole dug in the centre of the middle basement, and

<p>the powder was put down there. The box, when it was put into

</p>
<p>the bole, just came level with the ground, and it was covered with
</p>
<p>gravel.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the fuze by which it was to be set off?
</p>
<p>A. Not at that time. I did not know there was a fuze to it then.
</p>
<p>Tliere was nothinsf more done to it at that time. I took one of the
</p>
<p>sentries from the outside of the building, placed him over this pow-
</p>
<p>der, so that no accident might occur ; and the next day Major Turner
</p>
<p>showed us the fuze in the office,  showed it to everybody there, 
</p>
<p>a long fuze, made of gutta percha. Such a fuze I had never seen
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he have charge of the fuze himself?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : nobody else had it but himself. The powder
</p>
<p>reiPxained there until May. I think it was in May, Major Turner
</p>
<p>went South, and all the prisoners were sent out of the Libby build-
</p>
<p>ing proper to the South ; and General Winder sent a note down to
</p>
<p>the office with directions to take up the powder as privately as pos-
</p>
<p>sible, or as secretly as possible,  I forget the words; and I either
</p>
<p>gave or sent the note. The note was delivered into my hands for
</p>
<p>the inspector of the prison, who, I supposed, took it up. I did not
</p>
<p>see it taken up.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it stated by Major Turner in what event this powder was
</p>
<p>to have been set off?
</p>
<p>A. Not at that time ; but afterwards I heard him speak about it,
</p>
<p>and say that, in the event of the raiders coming into Richmond, he
</p>
<p>would have blown up the place ; and I understood him to say that
</p>
<p>such were his orders.
</p>
<p>Q. The purpose being to destroy the building and the prisoners
</p>
<p>in it ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose so.

<p>Q. State to the Couil whether you know the prisoner at the bar,
</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold.
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>140 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not he has been in the military
</p>
<p>service of the rebels.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewixg. I object to that question.
</p>
<p>The Judge Adtocate. State the grounds of your objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. The ground of my objection to that question is,
</p>
<p>that Arnold is here on trial for having been engaged in a conspiracy
</p>
<p>to do certain things, and that it is not competent for the Goverament
</p>
<p>to show (if such be the fact), that, before he entered into the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, he was in the military service of the Confederate States. He
</p>
<p>is not on tnal for having been in the military service of the Confed-
</p>
<p>erate States. He is on trial for offences defined clearly in the
</p>
<p>chai-ge and specification ; and it seems to me it is clearly not competent
</p>
<p>to attempt to aggravate the offence of which he is charged, and of
</p>
<p>which tliey seek to prove him guilty, by proving that he has been
</p>
<p>unfaithful to the Government in other resjjects and at other times ;
</p>
<p>and it is introduced, and can be introduced, for no other purpose
</p>
<p>than that of ao;2Tavatinof his alleo;ed offences in connection with this
</p>
<p>conspiracy. That course of testimony would be, in effect, to allow
</p>
<p>the prosecution to initiate testimony as to the previous character of
</p>
<p>the accused ; and that is a right that is reserved to the accused always,
</p>
<p>and is never allowed to the prosecution. It would do more than
</p>
<p>that : it would allow them to do what the accused is not allowed on
</p>
<p>his own behalf on the point of character ; that is, to show acts
</p>
<p>wholly unconnected with the crimes with which he is charged, fi'om
</p>
<p>which his previous character may be inferred.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. If the Court please, I will. make a single
</p>
<p>remark. I think the testimony in this case has proved, what I be-
</p>
<p>lieve history sufficiently attests, how kindred to each other are the
</p>
<p>crimes of treason against a nation and the assassination of its chief
</p>
<p>magistrate. I think of those crimes the one seems to be, if not the
</p>
<p>necessary consequence, certainly a logical sequence from the other.
</p>
<p>The murder of the President of the United States, as alleged and
</p>
<p>shown, was pre-eminently a poUtical assassination. Disloyalty to

<p>the Government was its sole, its only inspiration. When, therefore,
</p>
<p>we shall show, on the part of the accused, acts of intense disloyalty,

</p>
<p>him the presence of an animus towards the Government which

<p>THE TRIAL. 141
</p>
<p>relieves this accusation of mucli, if not all, of its improbability.
</p>
<p>And this coui-se of proof is constantly resorted to in criminal courts.
</p>
<p>I do not regard it as in the slightest degree a departure from the
</p>
<p>usages of the profession in the administration of public justice. The
</p>
<p>purpose is to show that the prisoner, in his mind and course of life,
</p>
<p>was prepared for the commission of this crime ; that the tendencies
</p>
<p>of his life, as evidenced by open and overt acts, lead and point to
</p>
<p>this crime, if not as a necessary, certainly as a most probable result ;
</p>
<p>and it is with that view, and that only, that the testimony is offered.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. Can the learned Judge Advocate produce any
</p>
<p>authority to sustain his position ?
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I think there is abundance of testimony
</p>
<p>to sustain the position. Mr. Bingham can state it.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. In Roscoe there is ex-
</p>
<p>press authority. The book was here ; but I see it is not here now.
</p>
<p>As the gentleman calls for authority, I will state now, and pledge
</p>
<p>myself to bring the book into the court-room, that Roscoe's Crimi-
</p>
<p>nal Evidence, about page 85 or 89, contains the express text in the
</p>
<p>body of it, that, when the intent with which a thing is done is in
</p>
<p>issue, other acts of the prisoner, not in issue to prove that intent,
</p>
<p>may be given in evidence ; and that is exactly the point that is made
</p>
<p>here by the Judge Advocate Greneral, It is not the point contem-
</p>
<p>plated by the counsel ; and, putting it on the ground on which he
</p>
<p>puts it, nobody contends for it. It is alleged in this cliarge and
</p>
<p>specification that this paity engaged in this conspiracy to murder
</p>
<p>the President of the United States, to murder the Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, to murder the Vice-President, and to murder Lieutenant-
</p>
<p>General Grant, the commander of the armies in the field under tiie
</p>
<p>direction of the President, with intent to aid the Rebellion against
</p>
<p>the United States. The intent is put in issue here by the charge and
</p>
<p>specification against all these prisoners ; and the attempt now made is
</p>
<p>to establish that intent by proving what ? By proving that this man
</p>
<p>himself was part of the Rebellion ; that he was in it. I undertake

<p>to say that there is no authority which is fit to be read in a court of
</p>
<p>justice anywhere that can be brought against it. I may just as well
</p>
<p>remark in this connection here, that the general rules of evidence
</p>
<p>which obtain in the courts of the common law are always recognized
</p>
<p>142 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>by the military courts. The ground on which it is put  I state
</p>
<p>the authority in words  is, that on a criminal trial where the intent
</p>
<p>is in issue, other acts of the prisoner, not in issue, may be proved
</p>
<p>against him by the prosecution in order to show that intent. The
</p>
<p>cases are very numerous.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. Just refer to the allegation.
</p>
<p>IMr. Bingham. The gentleman asks me to refer to the allegation.
</p>
<p>I will. The charge is, " maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously,
</p>
<p>and in aid of the existingi; armed Rebellion a2;ainst the United States
</p>
<p>of x\merica, on or before the 6th day of March, A.D. 1865, com-
</p>
<p>bining, confederating, and conspiring together" with the persons
</p>
<p>named in the charge, " and others unknown, to kill and murder,
</p>
<p>within the iMilitary Department of Washington, and within the forti-
</p>
<p>fied and intrenched lines thereof, Abraham Lincoln, &c." Com-
</p>
<p>bining, confederating, and conferring together " in aid of the
</p>
<p>existing armed Rebellion against the United States of America ' ' is
</p>
<p>the allegation : that is the intent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. It is an allegation of fact, and not of intent.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I understand the gen-
</p>
<p>tleman; but I assert that the words there used, "in aid of the
</p>
<p>existing armed Rebellion against the United States of America,"
</p>
<p>are words of intent. The formality of an indictment is simply
</p>
<p>departed from. If the charge had followed the common-law form,
</p>
<p>it would have read, " with intent to aid the existing: armed Rebellion
</p>
<p>against the United States," the parties did then and there agree,
</p>
<p>combine, and confederate together, to kill and murder the President
</p>
<p>of the United States. These words are not the express terms used ;
</p>
<p>but they are by necessary implication implied : it is nothing but an
</p>
<p>allegation of intent, and never was any thing else. It is no part
</p>
<p>of the body of the charge beyond the allegation of intent.
</p>
<p>Then comes the specification in regard to the prisoner Arnold.
</p>
<p>The first clause of the specification is, that the various persons here
</p>

<p>fee, &c,, . . . "and, by the means aforesaid, to aid and com-
</p>
<p>brt the insurgents engaged in armed Rebellion against the

</p>
<p>;aying, " designing and intending thereby to aid and comfort the
</p>
<p>nsuro-ents engao-ed in armed Rebellion a2;ainst the United
</p>
<p>states"? There is the specification ; and I should like to know
</p>
<p>low an intent could be laid any more strongly than that, or more
</p>
<p>brmally than that. It is an allegation of intent ; and I say the
</p>
<p>j^uestion stands on authority. Not anticipating that such an objec-
</p>
<p>ion could be raised, I have not marked authorities, and brought
</p>
<p>;hem in here ; but I pledge myself to bring into Court, from Ros-
</p>
<p>;oe's " Criminal Evidence," in express words, the text which I
</p>
<p>lave stated.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. If the Court will allow me, I will refer to an
</p>
<p>luthority enunciating the great principle which I claim : 
</p>
<p>" Evidence will not be admitted on the part of the prosecution to
</p>
<p>show the bad character of the accused, unless he has called wifc-
</p>
<p>lesses in support of his character ; and even then the prosecution
</p>
<p>3annot examine as to particular act."  Benet on Military Law and
</p>
<p>Courts- Martial, p. 287.
</p>
<p>That is the general principle of law, which is doubtless familiar
</p>
<p>;o the Court ; but the learned gentleman seeks to take this case out
</p>
<p>)f the general principle, upon the argument that it is alleged in the
</p>
<p>iharge that the crimes for which the accused is beino- tried were
</p>
<p>lone with the intent of aiding the Rebellion. Now, if, by the prac-
</p>
<p>:ice of military courts, the allegation that the crimes were coramit-
</p>
<p>:ed with intent to aid the Rebellion were a necessary allegation, the
</p>
<p>Court should reject the testimony now offered on the ground of

</p>
<p>irrelevancy. The acts charged are acts of conspiracy to murder the
</p>
<p>President, the heads of Government, and the leader of the armies
</p>
<p>Df the United States, during the existence of the Rebellion ; and
</p>
<p>proof of these acts would be conclusive as to the intent to aid the
</p>
<p>144 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Rebellion ; and that evidence of intent would not be in the least
</p>
<p>aided by proof of service in the Confederate army prior to and un-
</p>
<p>connected with the acts of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>But the allegation of intent here is an unnecessary allegation.
</p>
<p>The crimes charged are the crimes of murder and attempted assas-
</p>
<p>sination ; and it is unnecessary to go further, and allege that they
</p>
<p>were done with the intent to aid the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>If, to support this unnecessary allegation as to intent, the Court
</p>
<p>should admit evidence which would be inadmissible in the civil courts
</p>
<p>in a trial on an indictment for the crimes here charged, it would, I
</p>
<p>think, violate the law of evidence, because the prosecution has seen
</p>
<p>fit to disregard the rules of pleading. The law of evidence is  and
</p>
<p>it apphes to cases of conspiracy as to all other criminal cases 
</p>
<p>that the prosecution can show no criminal acts not part of the res
</p>
<p>gestce of the oiFences charged, unless the offences charged consist
</p>
<p>of acts which are not in themselves obviously unlawful, and from
</p>
<p>the commission of which, therefore, the evil intent cannot be pre-
</p>
<p>sumed,  such as uttering forged instruments or counterfeit money,
</p>
<p>or receiving stolen goods.
</p>
<p>Before any jury, or almost any body of men, proof that a person
</p>
<p>charged with one crime, and on trial, had before that committed some
</p>
<p>other crime, would prejudice his cause materially ; and it is to avoid
</p>
<p>that result that this wholesome rule of law has been estabUshed.
</p>
<p>That the assassination of the President grew out of the spirit of
</p>
<p>the Rebellion, and was one of its monstrous developments, is most
</p>
<p>true : but the prisoners who are here on trial are to be tried on
</p>
<p>evidence admissible under the rules of law ; and the accused was
</p>
<p>not called upon to show here whether or not, a year or eighteen
</p>
<p>months before this alleged conspiracy was begun, he committed the
</p>
<p>crime of having taken up arms against his Government. He is
</p>
<p>not on trial for that ; and I think it is unjust to prejudice his case
</p>
<p>by hearing and recording evidence of it, if such evidence can, in
</p>
<p>fact, be produced.

<p>I refer the Court, in further support of my objection, to Whar-

<p>Evidence," page 76.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I have no desire to de-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 145
</p>
<p>ay the Court ; but I am very anxious to make good what I said, and
</p>
<p>-0 vindicate the proposition of tlie Judge Advocate General. I said
</p>
<p>)efore that I undertook to state that no book fit to be brought into
</p>
<p>I court of justice could be brought in here to sustain the proposi-
</p>
<p>ion upon which his objection rests. My proposition was, that, when
</p>
<p>he intent with which a thing was done is put in issue, other acts
</p>
<p>>f the prisoner, not in issue on the trial, of the same character,
</p>
<p>nay be given in evidence to prove that intent. Now I propose
</p>
<p>o read from the book which the gentleman himself has read ; but
</p>
<p>le did not read quite far enough : 
</p>
<p>' ' Knowledge and intent, when material, must be shown by the
</p>
<p>)rosecution. "  Whartoii's American Criminal Law, page 309,
</p>
<p>\ 631.
</p>
<p>It becomes material here, because it is alleged as to the conspi-
</p>
<p>ators that they conspired with the intent to aid this Rebellion both
</p>
<p>n the charge and in the specification ; not they murdered with that
</p>
<p>ntent, but conspired to murder with that intent, to aid the Rebel-
</p>
<p>ion. The language of this author (Wharton) is, " Knowledge and
</p>
<p>ntent, when material, must be shown by the prosecutor. It is
</p>
<p>mpossible, it is true, in most cases to make them out by direct evi-
</p>
<p>lence, unless they have been confessed, but may be gathered from
</p>
<p>he conduct of the party as shown in proof; and, when the tendency
</p>
<p>)f his actions is direct and manifest, he must always be presumed
</p>
<p>o have designed the result when he acted.'*
</p>
<p>As to guilty knowledge, on the same page of the book, the author
</p>
<p>says, 
</p>
<p>" The law in this respect seems to be that evidence of other acts
</p>
<p>)r conduct of a similar character, even although involving substan-
</p>
<p>ive crimes, is admissible to prove guilty knowledge," even although
</p>
<p>t shows other crimes not involved before the Court. On the very
</p>
<p>lext page, the same author says, 
</p>
<p>" The same evidence is generally admissible to prove intent as to
</p>
<p>>how guilty knowledge."

</p>
<p>That is to say, other acts, although involving substantive crime,
</p>
<p>nay be admitted. I do not think the wi'iter of that book, if he
</p>
<p>lad been writing for this occasion, could have written it more plain-
</p>
<p>y than that. On the point the gentleman made, the writer con-

</p>
<p>eludes us on that question by saying, *' that, if the crime itself is
</p>
<p>committed, the intent is necessarily presumed by the law." To be
</p>
<p>sure it is ; but there are two allegations here. One is a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy 
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. To murder the President.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. A conspiracy, with
</p>
<p>intent to aid the Rebellion, to murder the President ; and then there
</p>
<p>is the murdering of the President in aid of the Rebellion in pursu-
</p>
<p>ance of the conspiracy. Now, we are trying to prove the intent
</p>
<p>with which they entered into this conspiracy and executed it. This
</p>
<p>book, in answer to that suggestion of the gentleman, says, 
</p>
<p>" A defendant's conduct during the res gestcB, as his manner at
</p>
<p>the time of passing the note, or his having passed by several names,
</p>
<p>is also admissible for the same purpose ; but the intent, the guilty
</p>
<p>knowledge, must be brought directly home to the defendant ; but
</p>
<p>in no case can evidence tending to show it be admitted until the
</p>
<p>corpus delicti is first clearly shown."
</p>
<p>What then ? Then it may be.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. That is the res gestae.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. No : as to the intent.
</p>
<p>What becomes of the objection now ? The body of the crime has
</p>
<p>been proved according to the practice of the common law, as a gen-
</p>
<p>eral thing ; and the only exception that I know of, of any note, is
</p>
<p>the exception made at common law in cases of conspiracy, which
</p>
<p>the gentleman will remember is written in the text of Starkie.
</p>
<p>Then what next? In order to prove the intent, .you may have
</p>
<p>other acts of the prisoner, although they involve substantive crime ;
</p>
<p>and the same text and section of Wharton goes on to say, 
</p>
<p>" On the charge of sending a threatening letter, prior and sub-
</p>
<p>sequent letters from the person to the party threatening may be
</p>
<p>given in evidence as explanatory of the meaning and intent of the
</p>
<p>particular letter upon which the indictment is framed."

</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I say it does apply;
</p>
<p>that sending prior and subsequent letters is a distinctive crime,
</p>
<p>for which he might also be indicted ; and entering into this is a
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 147
</p>
<p>distinctive crime, for wbicli the party may be also arraigned ; but,
</p>
<p>when he entered it, he entered into it to aid it, did he not ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. He did not enter into that to assassinate the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. Yes : he entered into
</p>
<p>it to assassinate the President ; and everybody else that entered
</p>
<p>into the Rebellion entered it to assassinate everybody that repre-
</p>
<p>sented this Government, that either followed the standard in the
</p>
<p>field, or represented its standard in the counsels. That is exactly
</p>
<p>why it is germane.
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate [to the witness]. Now state to the Court
</p>
<p>whether the prisoner, Samuel Arnold, within your knowledge, has
</p>
<p>been in the military service of the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say positively.
</p>
<p>Q. What knowledge have you on the subject ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen him in Richmond, with the uniform on, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. The uniform of the rebel military service ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it the uniform of a private soldier, or of an officer?
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you not remember the year ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was in 1862.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not in May, 1861, that you saw the prisoner Arnold?
</p>
<p>A. It may have been. I cannot say positively.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not ill at the time ? Did he not look ill?
</p>
<p>A. I declare I cannot remember. I know that he had been ill ;
</p>
<p>but whether it was at that time or not, I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. You think it probable this was in 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. It might have been : I cannot state the year positively. I
</p>
<p>remember seeing him several times : when it was, I cannot say.

</p>
<p>Q. He was at large in Richmond, wearing tlie rebel uniform ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. It is hard to tell whether he had on a particular

<p>John Caldwell,
</p>

</p>
<p>of the President.

</p>
<p>Street.

</p>
<p>A, It was about eis-ht o'clock when he came there.
</p>
<p>Q. State what occurred between you and the prisoner.
</p>
<p>A. He came in ; and I asked him how he was, and so on. He
</p>
<p>told me he was going to the country, and asked me if I did not
</p>
<p>want to buy his watch. I told him no ; I had a watch of my own ;
</p>
<p>that I had no use for a watch. He then asked me, to lend him ten
</p>
<p>dollars. I told him I had not the money to spare to lend to him ;
</p>
<p>and he then took his revolver off, and said, "Lend me ten dollars, and
</p>
<p>take this as security, and I will bring it back or send it to you
</p>
<p>next week." I thought the revolver was good security for the mon-
</p>
<p>ey, and I let him have it, and expected him back to pay again.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize that revolver now ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think I should.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that it ? [Submitting to the witness a revolving pistol.]
</p>
<p>A. That is the revolver.

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you inquire of him why the revolver was loaded ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. You simply gave him money, and kept the revolver?

<p>A. No, sir : I never did.

</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Look at that revolver, and state whether it has ever been
</p>
<p>fired, or is a new one.
</p>
<p>A. It looks as if it had been fired ; but I never fired it. It was
</p>
<p>loaded when I got it, and it is loaded now.
</p>
<p>Q. Does it give evidence of ever having been fired ?
</p>
<p>A. It looks as if it had been.

<p>somewhere,"  he did say at that time, but I really forget now
</p>
<p>where he was going to cross at the Point of Rocks ; " and I would
</p>
<p>not be the least surprised if very soon from this "  he stated at
</p>
<p>what time, but I forget at what length of time he said  "he will

<p>174 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate here announced that the case on the part
</p>
<p>of the prosecution was closed, subject to the reservation (which was
</p>
<p>agreed to by the counsel for the accused) of the right to call wit-
</p>
<p>nesses at any time hereafter, during the progress of the trial, as to
</p>
<p>the general conspiracy charged, and also to introduce documentary
</p>
<p>evidence as to the nature, extent, and character of the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>Rev. B. F. Wiget,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows: 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court your residence in this city, and occupa-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>A. I live in the Gonzaga College, F Street, between Ninth and
</p>
<p>Tenth. I am president of the college.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bai-, Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. I am.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?
</p>
<p>A. It is about ten or eleven years since I first became acquainted
</p>
<p>with her.
</p>
<p>Q. Has that acquaintance been of an intimate character ?
</p>
<p>A. I knew her well.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with her general reputation ?
</p>
<p>A. I always heard every one speak very highly of her character
</p>
<p>as a lady and as a Christian.
</p>
<p>Q. During all this acquaintance, has any thing ever come to your
</p>
<p>knowledge respecting the lady that would be called of an unchris-
</p>
<p>tian character ?
</p>
<p>A. No : never.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Louis J. Weichmann?
</p>
<p>A. Only slightly : I have seen him a few times. I am not so
</p>
<p>well acquainted with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court, if, from your knowledge of him,

</p>
<p>you know whether he has ever been a student of divinity ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question
</p>
<p>. THE TRIAL. 175
</p>
<p>as wholly immaterial. Wliere a witness is asked in regard to what
</p>
<p>his profession was, apart from any matter of criminality, and he
</p>
<p>answers it, even on cross-examination, the law everywhere says
</p>
<p>that that shall end it ; and the reason for that rule of law was this :
</p>
<p>that if immaterial questions were asked, and answers obtained, and
</p>
<p>the witnesses contradicted, the case would never end if the Court
</p>
<p>lived to be as old as Methuselah, provided a succession of counsel
</p>
<p>could be obtained to keep up the fire.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken replied that Mr. Weichmann had stated that he was
</p>
<p>a student of divinity ; and that one reason why he wished to go to
</p>
<p>Richmond was for the purpose of continuing his theological studies
</p>
<p>there, as he was studying for the diocese of Richmond. This was
</p>
<p>not the only point on which he proposed to impeach Mr. Weich-
</p>
<p>mann 's testimony. The foundation was laid for it in the cross-exami-
</p>
<p>nation.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham reminded the counsel
</p>
<p>that there was one part of it not laid at all. When the witness
</p>
<p>Weichmann was asked what his reasons were for wishing to go to
</p>
<p>Richmond, he objected to it ; and the Court sustained the objection,
</p>
<p>on the ground that the Court could never try the secret purposes
</p>
<p>of a man's mind in regard to a matter that was not in itself unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful, and which was wholly immaterial and collateral.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken said he would recall the recollection of the learned
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate to the fact, that the answer of Mr.
</p>
<p>Weichmann was on the record, that he was a student of divinity,
</p>
<p>and that he desired to go to Richmond to continue his studies
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I know it is on the
</p>
<p>record ; but the reason why he wished to go was ruled out.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By jMr. Aiken.] Is there an institution in the city of
</p>
<p>Ricbmond for theological studies ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to that ques-

<p>tion. What is the necessity of inquiring into that? You might
</p>
<p>as well ask whether it was an octagon or not ; whether it was two
</p>
<p>stories or forty stories high.
</p>
<p>176 TEE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. I insist on asking the question. It can be over-
</p>
<p>ruled if the Court choose to do so.
</p>
<p>General "Wallace. I should like to have the gentleman state
</p>
<p>what he wants to ask the question for.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. In the examination of all the witnesses on the part
</p>
<p>of the Grovemment in this case, the largest latitude was allowed.
</p>
<p>Matters not affecting the prisoners at the bar were gone into exten-
</p>
<p>sively. No objection was made to it by the counsel for the accused.
</p>
<p>They were just as anxious as any member of the Court that this
</p>
<p>conspiracy should be ferreted out to the very bottom, and that every-
</p>
<p>body proved to be connected with it should suffer its just punish-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. Weichmann, one of the principal witnesses on the
</p>
<p>stand, was interrogated as to these points. The foundation was
</p>
<p>laid for impeaching his credibility as a witness. These questions to
</p>
<p>the witness now on the stand (which I have a right to put) are for
</p>
<p>that very purpose. In view of every thing that was gone into on
</p>
<p>the part of the Government, it seems a little strange that we should
</p>
<p>l>e met on the very threshold of the defence with these objections.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I desire to say to the
</p>
<p>Court, without wishing to delay them, that we do not intend to
</p>
<p>object to any thing in the world that can tend in any way to estab-
</p>
<p>lish the innocence of the accused, or to remove the weight of testi-
</p>
<p>mony  if there be any that has weight  in evidence against
</p>
<p>them ; but we beg leave to say to the Court that it is perfectly
</p>
<p>clear upon all principle, and certainly must be clear to the reason
</p>
<p>of every man, that testimony of this sort cannot weigh the weight
</p>
<p>of a feather on the subject of the guilt or innocence of the accused,
</p>
<p>or of the truthfulness of any witness that has been examined in
</p>
<p>this Court, for the reason that it is an issue upon which this Court
</p>
<p>have no power to pass at all. If the gentleman chose, on the cross-
</p>
<p>examination, to ask whether this man wanted to go to Richmond
</p>
<p>or not, and he answered it, they must be bound by the answer.
</p>
<p>There is no rule of law clearer than that on a collateral question,
</p>

</p>
<p>which does not touch the guilt or innocence of the accused, in any
</p>
<p>way they are bound by the answer. It ends the question. They
</p>
<p>have got it. It is not worth any thing against the accused, and not
</p>
<p>worth much for her, in my judgment.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 177
</p>
<p>General Wallace. The witness Weichmann did not state that
</p>
<p>there was a theological academy or any thing of that kind in Rich-
</p>
<p>mond.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. He said he belonged to that diocese, and wanted
</p>
<p>to go to that diocese to finish his studies.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. He said nothing about a theological
</p>
<p>school there. He said he wished to go there for the purpose of
</p>
<p>continuing his theological studies.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. The inference was, if he was going to complete his
</p>
<p>theological studies, that there was a school there.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You do not propose to
</p>
<p>contradict inferences, I suppose ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. It is not an inference, either.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. Even if he had made the statement,
</p>
<p>the decision which the Court has just made would meet the ques-
</p>
<p>tion precisely.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. I understood the object of the counsel to
</p>
<p>be, to impeach not only the witness for the Government, but also
</p>
<p>the fairness of the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. No, sir : only the witness ; not the fairness of the
</p>
<p>Court at all. I have no reason to complain of that. None of us
</p>
<p>have had.
</p>
<p>]Mr. Clampitt. May it please the Court, I put that question to
</p>
<p>Mr. Weichmann, when on the stand, in reference to his desire to go
</p>
<p>to Richmond ; and the learned Assistant Judge Advocate objected
</p>
<p>to it. Knowing that we would hereafter impeach his testimony, I
</p>
<p>put that question to him at that time in order to lay the foundation
</p>
<p>for that impeachment. It seemed to me to be very strange that a
</p>
<p>man who professed to be a loyal man, and in the employ of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, should wish to go to Richmond to finish his theological
</p>
<p>studies, when theological text-books had been cast aside for gun-
</p>
<p>barrels and gunpowder, and he was in a beleaguered city.
</p>
<p>^ Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I will read one authority

</p>
<p>on this subject. I should be ashamed to make a statement about a
</p>
<p>matter of this sort, which is so plain, without knowing that what I
</p>
<p>said was true. I read from Wharton's "American Criminal Law,"
</p>
<p>page 434, section 817 : 
</p>
<p>178 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>** The credit of a witness may be impeached by proof that he has
</p>
<p>made statements out of court contrary to what he has testified at the
</p>
<p>trial. But it is only in such matters as are relevant to the issue
</p>
<p>that the witness can be contradicted. Therefore a witness cannot be
</p>
<p>examined as to any distinct collateral fact irrelevant to the issue for
</p>
<p>the purpose of impeaching his testimony afterwards by contradicting
</p>
<p>his statements."
</p>
<p>I think that is middling plain. K there is any thing irrelevant
</p>
<p>in the world, it is whether Mr. Weichmann wanted to go to Richmond
</p>
<p>to prosecute his studies. That he wanted to go there, he has proved
</p>
<p>himself, if they will believe it. Now it is proposed to contradict
</p>
<p>him ; to show that he did not want to go there, I suppose. That, I
</p>
<p>presume, if any thing, would be to his credit ; but I object to it
</p>
<p>because it is in*elevant, and forbidden by law.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. We have abundant proof of what he wished to go
</p>
<p>there for. We will state that afterwards.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You cannot prove any
</p>
<p>such thing.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] In your acquaintance with Mrs. Surratt,
</p>
<p>have you ever learned any thing of defective eyesight on her part ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I have not.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You say you have personal knowledge of her general charac-
</p>
<p>ter as a Christian ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any personal knowledge of her character for
</p>
<p>loyalty ?
</p>
<p>A. No. My visits were all short ; and political affairs did not
</p>
<p>come up in those visits.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you had intercourse with her as her pastor during this
</p>
<p>Kebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I was not her pastor. Years ago, she had two sons with me ;

<p>and it was in that way that I first knew her.
</p>
<p>Q. How often have you been in the habit of seeing her during
</p>
<p>the Tcebellion.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 179
</p>
<p>A. For the last six months, maybe once in six weeks, and may
</p>
<p>be once a week.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you, in meeting her, had free conversation with her?
</p>
<p>A. As I said, my conversation would be only for a few minutes,
</p>
<p>and my visits would be such as my visits generally are,  short, and
</p>
<p>with the ordinary common talk.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever heard her, in all of your conversations since
</p>
<p>the beginning of the Rebellion to this time, utter one loyal senti-
</p>
<p>ment ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember.
</p>
<p>Q, Will you state whether it is not notorious, among those who
</p>
<p>knew any thing of her, that she is intensely disloyal ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember that anybody talked about her before this
</p>
<p>last affair happened.
</p>
<p>Rev. Francis E. Boyle,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court your residence in this city, and occupa-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>A. My residence is at St. Peter's Church. I am a Catholic
</p>
<p>priest.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acq^uainted with Mary E. Surratt, the prisoner at
</p>
<p>the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. I have some acquaintance with her.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?
</p>
<p>A. I think I made her acquaintance some eight or nine years
</p>
<p>ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Has that acquaintance been of an intimate character some-
</p>
<p>what ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have met her, casually, three or four times since.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know any thing of her general reputation ?
</p>
<p>A. I have heard her always well spoken of as an estimable lady,

<p>and never heard any thing to her disadvantage.
</p>
<p>Q. In all your intercourse with her, have you ever heard her
</p>
<p>utter disloyal sentiments ?
</p>
<p>180 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Never, sir.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever heard her utter loyal sentiments?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard much of her sentiments at all.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you have been in conversation with her only three
</p>
<p>or four times ?
</p>
<p>A. At large intervals.
</p>
<p>Q. You, therefore, do not undertake to say what her general
</p>
<p>reputation for loyalty is, do you ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Rev. Charles H. Stonestreet,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court your residence and occupation ?
</p>
<p>A. I reside for the present in Washington. I am the pastor of
</p>
<p>St. Aloysius Church in this city.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Mary E. Surratt, the prisoner at
</p>
<p>the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. I am acquainted with her.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?
</p>
<p>A. I first became acquainted with her about twenty years ago,
</p>
<p>during the first years of my mission, when I was in Alexandria. It
</p>
<p>was on an official call that I became acquainted with her ; I think,
</p>
<p>to see her mother-in-law.
</p>
<p>Q. Has the acquaintance since that time been of a somewhat
</p>
<p>intimate character?
</p>
<p>A. It was interrupted. I did not see her again for about two
</p>
<p>years, and then only occasionally and transiently. In passing
</p>
<p>through the country, I called at her place,  Surrattsville, I believe
</p>
<p>it is called.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you lately, within a year or two past, been more inti-
</p>
<p>mate with her?

</p>
<p>A. I have not : I have scarcely seen her.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 181
</p>
<p>Q. So far as you know, what is her general reputation as a
</p>
<p>Christian lady ?
</p>
<p>A. I always looked upon her as a proper Christian matron.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you, in all your intercourse with her, ever heard her
</p>
<p>utter disloyal sentiments ?
</p>
<p>A. Never: there was no question of it at the time I was
</p>
<p>acquainted jsvith her.
</p>
<p>Q. Had Mrs. Surratt, so far as you know, been a generous per-
</p>
<p>son,  kind to the poor?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state how often you have probably seen her since
</p>
<p>the commencement of the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember of having seen her  I may have seen
</p>
<p>her transiently  since the commencement of the Rebellion,
</p>
<p>Q. You have no knowledge, then, whatever of her character for
</p>
<p>loyalty since the Rebellion commenced ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing but what I have read in the papers.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Eliza Holahan,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mrs, Mary E. Surratt, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Mrs. Surratt, the prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar?
</p>
<p>A. I boarded with Mrs. Surratt from the 7th of Febraary until
</p>
<p>after the assassination of the President,  two days afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard of him as Mr. Payne ; I saw him at Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt's twice, and he called himself Wood.
</p>
<p>Q. When did he first come to Mrs. Surratt's?
</p>
<p>A. I think, when I first saw him, it was early in February. The
</p>
<p>second time, I think, was during the month of March.

</p>
<p>182 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. State to tbe Court under what circumstances lie came to Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt's house.
</p>
<p>A. Indeed, I do not know the circumstances.
</p>
<p>Q. How did he introduce himself?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know any thing about it. The first time I saw him
</p>
<p>I went into the parlor, and he was sitting in the parlor ; and I was
</p>
<p>introduced to him as I\Ir. Wood. I never exchanged ,a word with
</p>
<p>him on either visit.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he representing himself at that time as a Baptist
</p>
<p>preacher ?
</p>
<p>A. I asked Miss Anna who he was ; and she said he was a Mr.
</p>
<p>Wood, a Baptist minister. I said I did not think he would convert
</p>
<p>many souls : he did not look as if he would.
</p>
<p>Q. The first time he came, how long did he remain at Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt's house ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw him but the one night.
</p>
<p>Q. He remained there one night ?
</p>
<p>A. One night.
</p>
<p>Q, Did Mrs. Surratt keep a boarding-house?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think she kept a boarding-house. There was only
</p>
<p>my family and another young lady that boarded there.
</p>
<p>Q. Was she ever in the habit of giving people rooms in her
</p>
<p>house for a short time ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know any thing about it. I never saw Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>before I went to board with her, and never heard of her.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did Payne stay there when he came in JVIarch?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know ; two or three days, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. When was the last time that you saw him at ]Mrs. Surratt's
</p>
<p>house ?
</p>
<p>A. It was some time in March : I do not know when.
</p>
<p>Q. You have no means of fixing the exact date ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not. I never thouo-ht of it at all. I thoupjht he was
</p>
<p>a friend of theirs. I never asked any questions about it.

</p>
<p>Q. Can you recollect whether it was near the fii-st or the middle
</p>
<p>of the month ?
</p>
<p>A. Indeed, I do not know whether it was or not ; but I think it
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 183
</p>
<p>was about the middle of the month. It was after the inauguration
</p>
<p>of the President, I know.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner Atzerodt at her house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have. I never heard of him by the name of
</p>
<p>Atzerodt.
</p>
<p>Q When was he there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know when he was there. I saw him come in at
</p>
<p>times. He dined there once or twice while I was there. I never
</p>
<p>heard of him by the name of Atzerodt. I never knew what his
</p>
<p>name was. He called himself Port Tobacco while he was there ;
</p>
<p>and the ladies called him Port Tobacco.
</p>
<p>Q. Wei-e any objections made on the part of any member of
</p>
<p>the family to his being there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : I heard Mrs. Surratt say she objected to Mr. Atzer-
</p>
<p>odt ; she did not like him.
</p>
<p>Q. And did not wish him to come there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know about his coming there ; but she would not
</p>
<p>board him. I heard her say at the table that she would rather he
</p>
<p>would not come there to board.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been intimate with Mrs. Surratt since you have
</p>
<p>been there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I cannot say intimate. I liked her very much :
</p>
<p>she was a very kind lady to board with ; but I was not intimate with
</p>
<p>her. I was more intimate with her daughter than I was with her.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have frequent conversations with Mrs. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not very.
</p>
<p>Q. In all the time you boarded in her house, did you ever hear
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt say any thing with reference to the existence of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to assassinate the President ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingiiam objected to the question.
</p>
<p>The law so hedges about this matter of crime, that those who are
</p>
<p>charged with crime are never permitted on their own motion to
</p>
<p>prove their random declarations to third persons, because, if it were

</p>
<p>so, the greatest criminal that ever cursed the earth and disgraced
</p>
<p>our common humanity could make an abundant amount of testi-
</p>
<p>mony out of the mouth of the most truthful people on the planet.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken replied, that if the witness had heard Mrs. Sui-ratt
</p>
<p>184 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>make any remarks witli reference to a conspiracy, and disclosed to
</p>
<p>her any knowledge of that fact, it would be valuable evidence on
</p>
<p>the part of the Government ; and it would be just as valuable to
</p>
<p>the defence if she did not.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Were you acquainted with J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, the actor?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen him at Mrs. Surratt's. I met him once in the
</p>
<p>parlor.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he come frequently to Mrs. Surratt's house ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw Mr. Booth more than three or four times. I
</p>
<p>never met him but once.
</p>
<p>Q. When he called at the house, did he spend most of his time
</p>
<p>there in company with Mrs. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I believe he did. He used to ask for Mr. John
</p>
<p>Surratt. as I understood ; and, if he was not there, for Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you learn any thing, while you were boarding with Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, of defective eyesight on her part ?
</p>
<p>A. I have heard Mrs. Surratt state 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You need not say what
</p>
<p>she stated.
</p>

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 103
</p>
<p>Q. What information did IMr. Lloyd give you at that tinio ?
</p>
<p>A. He denied knowing any thing about it first. He was there,
</p>
<p>I think, two days, denying it every day. I finally told him that
</p>
<p>my mind was made up ; that I was perfectly satisfied he was into
</p>
<p>it ; that he had a heavy load on his mind, and the sooner he got rid
</p>
<p>of it the better. He said to me then, *' my God ! if I should
</p>
<p>make a confession, they would murder me." Said I, " Who would
</p>
<p>murder you?"  "These parties that are in this conspiracy."'
</p>
<p>" Well," said I, " if you are afraid to be murdered yourself, and
</p>
<p>let these fellows get out of it, that is your business, not mine." I
</p>
<p>then put him in the guard-house. He seemed to be very much
</p>
<p>excited. Lieutenant Lovett went to Washino;ton for re-enforcements.
</p>
<p>Lloyd stated to me that Mrs. Surratt had come down to his place
</p>
<p>on Friday, betwixt four and five o'clock ; that she told him to have
</p>
<p>the fire-arms ready ; that two men would call for them at twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock ; and the two men did call ; and Herold dismounted from
</p>
<p>his horse, went into Lloyd's tavern, and told Lloyd, " I have some-
</p>
<p>thing to tell you." Lloyd stated that he did not want to hear it.
</p>
<p>Herold told him to go up and get those fire-arras. Tlie fire-arms,
</p>
<p>he stated, were brought down. Herold took one, and Booth's car-
</p>
<p>bine was carried out to. him, whether by Herold or Lloyd I cannot
</p>
<p>now distinctly state ; but that Booth said he could not caiTy his
</p>
<p>carbine : it was as much as he could do to carry himself, as his leg
</p>
<p>was broken. Then Booth told Lloyd, " I have murdered the
</p>
<p>President ; " and Herold said, *' I have fixed ofi* Seward." I then
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Lloyd why he did not communicate that fact, and not let
</p>
<p>these parties go ; and remain in the guard-house two days, and deny
</p>
<p>it. Said I, " These parties could have been tal^en if you had only
</p>
<p>given the alarm. Here is Mr. Roby, close by, whom you could
</p>
<p>have told ; and you could have spoken about the fire-arms being in
</p>
<p>your house." '
</p>
<p>Q. What information did he give you about the fire-arms him-

<p>self?

<p>A. He told me that when he came from Bryantown, from Colonel
</p>
<p>Wells, with a squad of cavalry. I was in the house when he came
</p>
<p>in. He comm-cnced crying, and hallooing out, " Oh ! Mrs. Surratt,

<p>VOL. II 17
</p>
<p>194 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>remember, you stated to me that there were two carbines ; that
</p>
<p>Booth could not carry his carbine : and now where is that carbine ? "
</p>
<p>He told me it was up stairs, in a little room that Mrs. Surratt had,
</p>
<p>with some bags in it. I went into that room, hunted about, and
</p>
<p>could not find the carbine. I said to Mrs. Lloyd, " This carbine
</p>
<p>must be found, for in this house it is ; and I am bound to cut up
</p>
<p>the whole partition until I find it." She then told a colored man
</p>
<p>to get an axe. I went into a room adjoining, where they went, and
</p>
<p>waited until the hu-ed man had struck three knocks on the wall. I
</p>
<p>then started in, because I suspected they must know where the ear-
</p>
<p>bine was. At the seventh blow, I pulled off the laths, and seized
</p>
<p>the carbine in a bag. There was a string tied around the muzzle
</p>
<p>of the carbine, and it was suspended by a string above, through the
</p>
<p>plastering ; and it seemed that the string had been broken, or else
</p>
<p>cut, and dropped down to the base.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not find the carbine where Lloyd told you it was?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. He hunted all over, and could not find it there.
</p>
<p>Q. During these two days, when Mr. Lloyd was denying all
</p>
<p>knowledge of these parties, did he mention the name of Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt then ?
</p>
<p>A. No, not when he was denying ; but, after he confessed, he
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was present besides yourself, at the time Lloyd made
</p>
<p>these statements to you ?
</p>
<p>A. There was nobody that I know of, except Mr. Jenkins,  a
</p>
<p>brother of Mrs. Surratt,  who was up in the room when I put the
</p>
<p>question to him. I said that I knew that he [Lloyd] was guilty ;
</p>
<p>that my mind was made up ; that I knew that he was in that con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, because there had been blockade-runners in his house ; and
</p>
<p>it was, I was told, a headquarters for rebels and blockade-runners.
</p>
<p>Q. During Mr. Lloyd's occupation of it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Lloyd make any further statements to you afterwards

</p>
<p>about it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What were those ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 195
</p>
<p>and to any statements made by Lloyd, except at the particular time
</p>
<p>specified.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect positively that Lloyd used the word ** fire-
</p>
<p>arms " in his statement ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt brought them there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; he did not. I think he said Johnny Surratt, or
</p>
<p>some name like that.
</p>
<p>Q. When did Mr. Lloyd state that Mrs. Surratt made that
</p>
<p>remark to him ?
</p>
<p>A. He said it to me outside of the guard-house.
</p>
<p>Q. But did not Mr. Lloyd say at what time Mrs. Surratt spoke
</p>
<p>about the fire-arms ?
</p>
<p>A. On Friday, betwixt four and five o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state any thing of other businessr she had there that
</p>
<p>day?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; he did not. He was too much depressed and wor-
</p>
<p>ried, and felt very much uneasy.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he have the appearance at that time of being very much
</p>
<p>frightened ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, no ! there was nothing to frighten him. I gave him
</p>
<p>his own way ; treated him very kindly. I told him that what he
</p>
<p>had to say I wanted voluntarily ; and I gave him some instruc-
</p>
<p>tions and advice, and sent him down to Colonel Wells, and told
</p>
<p>him, if there was any thing he kept back, he had better own up, tell
</p>
<p>every thing, make a clean breast of it.
</p>
<p>Q. For two days he denied all knowledge of it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. On what day of the week did he make this confession to you ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was on Tuesday or Wednesday : I will not be
</p>
<p>positive. My business was to prepare the way for other officers
</p>
<p>who were over me. I opened the way.

</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing to you at that time about the Surratts
</p>
<p>getting him into the difficulty ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, indeed : he cried bitterly in the presence of six of the
</p>
<p>guard. I was there. At the last interview I had with him. when
</p>
<p>196 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>he came to the house to come to Washington, he cried bitterly in
</p>
<p>the room, and threw his hands over his wife's neck, and hallooed for
</p>
<p>his prayer-book. Lloyd's wife and Mrs. Oflutt were there at the
</p>
<p>last interview in the room, and heard all the conversation. He
</p>
<p>cried aloud. I told him to brace up.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether, at the time, he mentioned the reasons why he
</p>
<p>had concealed all this matter thus long from you.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he stated that he was afraid.
</p>
<p>Q. Afraid of whom or what ?
</p>
<p>A. Afraid that parties there would murder him if he made this
</p>
<p>confession.
</p>
<p>Q. To whom did you understand hun to refer ?
</p>
<p>A. I understood him to refer to those who were in the conspir-
</p>
<p>acy, or some neighbors around. I cannot say which.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the precise language which he used in reference
</p>
<p>to Mrs. Surratt, as to her having got him into the difficulty ? Give
</p>
<p>the precise words, if you can.
</p>
<p>A. He said, in the last interview in his house, " Mrs. SuiTatt,
</p>
<p>that vile woman ! she has ruined me : I am to be shot ; I am to be
</p>
<p>shot ! "
</p>
<p>Bernard J. Early
</p>
<p>recalled as a witness for the accused, Michael O'Laughlin.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Cox.
</p>
<p>Q. In your examination on the part of the prosecution, you
</p>
<p>stated that you came from Baltimore, on Thursday afternoon, the
</p>
<p>13th of April last, in company with Michael O'Laughlin, the
</p>
<p>accused, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Henderson ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su-.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what train you came in ?
</p>
<p>A. We left Baltimore in the half-past three o'clock train, I
</p>
<p>believe.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did ypu reach Washington ?

</p>
<p>A. We reached Washington at the usual time: I believe it
</p>
<p>takes very nearly two hours to run down here.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 197
</p>
<p>Q. "Was it an accommodation-train ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that. AYe reached here about half-past five,
</p>
<p>I suppose.
</p>
<p>Q. State where you and O'Laughlin went to when you left the
</p>
<p>cars : state every place at which you were present with him ; if you
</p>
<p>were with him during the whole of that evening.
</p>
<p>A. After leaving the cars, we made the best of our way across
</p>
<p>to the avenue, and struck it at about First Street \ went down the
</p>
<p>avenue to between Third and Four and a Half Streets, to a restau-
</p>
<p>rant kept by a man named Lichau : I think it is called RuUman's
</p>
<p>Hotel. We went inside there, and came out again in a short time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson went into the barber-shop next door to get shaved.
</p>
<p>While he was in there, Mr. O'Laughlin asked me to walk down as
</p>
<p>far as the National Hotel with him. I did so : I went in ; he
</p>
<p>walked up to the desk, and inquired for some person, and told me
</p>
<p>to wait, he would detain me only a few minutes. I told him that
</p>
<p>I did not like to wait ; that I did not want to miss the rest of the
</p>
<p>party. He walked out as far as the door with me, and told me he
</p>
<p>would not detain me more than ten or fifteen minutes, and left me
</p>
<p>standing in front of the door ; went in, and returned again in about
</p>
<p>from three to five minutes. After he came out, we went down and
</p>
<p>met IMr. Henderson and Mr. Murphy at Lichau's : Henderson,
</p>
<p>though, had not got through shaving by the time we got back.
</p>
<p>After that we went in there and came out again, and took a walk
</p>
<p>up the avenue a considerable distance, I guess as far as Eleventh
</p>
<p>Street, and returned back to Welch's dining-saloon, and went in
</p>
<p>there and had supper.
</p>
<p>Q. Where is that saloon ?
</p>
<p>A. Over Wall & Stephens's. I stated here the other day, that
</p>
<p>did not' know where it was ; but I believe it is over Wall &
</p>
<p>^ephens's.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take supper there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>Q. How long did that last ?
</p>
<p>A. That lasted, I guess, about three-quarters of an hour.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know at what time you left there ?
</p>
<p>A. It must have been getting on to eight o'clock when we left

</p>
<p>198 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>there ; about half-past seven, I should say. After coming out of
</p>
<p>there, we returned down the avenue to RuUman's Hotel, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded then down as far as the corner of Third Street, where
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin and Murphy left Henderson and me standing on the
</p>
<p>corner of Third Street, saying they were going around to see a sick
</p>
<p>man who lived on B Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his name ?
</p>
<p>A. His name is Hoffman. I told them, that, if we were not on
</p>
<p>the corner, they would see us in the middle of the square, between
</p>
<p>Second and Third Streets. They returned in ten or fifteen min-
</p>
<p>utes, accompanied by Mr. Daniel Loughran. After meeting there,
</p>
<p>the five of us started up the avenue to see the illumination. We
</p>
<p>went up the avenue to a public reservation, above Seventh Street,
</p>
<p>when Mr. Murphy stopped there. We stopped at that point. One
</p>
<p>of them complained of having sore feet, and said he would not go
</p>
<p>any farther. I noticed on one of the boards pasted up, " Canter-
</p>
<p>bury Music Hall," there appeared the name of a party from Balti-
</p>
<p>more. We returned down on the other side of the reservation, and
</p>
<p>Murphy and Henderson had the lead.
</p>
<p>Q. What time was that ?
</p>
<p>A. That was getting on for nine o'clock. We went down, and
</p>
<p>went into the Canterbury Music Hall, and got in there just about
</p>
<p>the end of the first piece they were playing ; and we remained there
</p>
<p>till about ten o'clock : left after a certain dance on the bill. We
</p>
<p>came out of there, and proceeded to the Metropolitan Hotel ; and
</p>
<p>from there down to Lichan's or Bullman's Hotel.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did you reach Rullman's ?
</p>
<p>A. We reached Bullman's Hotel, I should suppose, about a
</p>
<p>quarter or half past ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Was O'Laughlin with you all that time ?
</p>
<p>A. He was all that time.
</p>
<p>Q. How late did you remain at that hotel ?
</p>
<p>A. We remained there for about an hour, I suppose.

</p>
<p>Q. Did anybody join you there on the steps ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Grillet was passing by with a lady at the time ; and he
</p>
<p>spoke to O'Laughlin, I believe.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 199
</p>
<p>Q. You say you remained tliere about an hour from a quarter-
</p>
<p>past ten ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you go then ?
</p>
<p>A. We left there ; and one of the men of the house, Mr. Giles,
</p>
<p>joined us. We went down the avenue as far as Second Street. I
</p>
<p>believe Mr. O'Laughlin is acquainted at a saloon on the corner of
</p>
<p>B Street, I think, and Second, where there was a dance, or some-
</p>
<p>thing going on ; and he took the lead over there, and we followed
</p>
<p>in. One of the parties bought tickets to go back into the ball.
</p>
<p>We did not stay there more than about an hour. We got tired of
</p>
<p>the affair, and came out ; went up the avenue again, stopped at
</p>
<p>several places, and went into the Metropolitan Hotel between one
</p>
<p>and two o'clock ; went out again for about five minutes, and re-
</p>
<p>tui'ned at about the hour of two, when we went up stairs to bed.
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand you to state upon your oath that ]\Ir.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, the accused, was with you all that time ?
</p>
<p>A. He was all that night.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where Mr. Stanton's residence in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton is ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where FrankHn Square is ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where Willard's Hotel is ?
</p>
<p>A. I have passed by it several times.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the situation of the Treasury Building ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. Mr. Stanton's house is six squares north of that, and one
</p>
<p>square east. I ask you if it is possible that Mr. O'Laughlin could
</p>
<p>have been at Mr. Stanton's at nine o'clock, or at any time between
</p>
<p>that and eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>and it was waived.

<p>Q. From nightfall, I wish you to explain again where he was
</p>
<p>until bedtime on Friday night.

</p>
<p>supper, up until the time he went out with Mr. Fuller.

<p>A. At Welch's, the same place.

</p>
<p>A. We returned down to RuUman's.
</p>
<p>Q. How late do you know of Mr. Laughlin's having been
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>A. I should suppose it was about ten o'clock. It might have
</p>
<p>been a little after. I did not take notice whether it was before we
</p>
<p>got the news of the assassination or afterwards. I remember dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly his going out with Mr. Fuller.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not remember distinctly whether that was before or
</p>
<p>after the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know how he was dressed on Thursday evening and
</p>
<p>on Friday?

</p>
<p>straight piece in the front,  the same coat he has on now: the
</p>
<p>pantaloons he has on now are the same he wore then.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you make them ?

</p>
<p>A. A double-breasted vest of the same material as the pantaloons.
</p>

</p>
<p>down.

<p>A. Purple and green.
</p>

</p>
<p>liquor on that Thursday and Friday night.
</p>
<p>A. On Friday night, getting on late towards ten o'clock, I
</p>
<p>should suppose we were.
</p>
<p>Q. How often did you drink before ten o'clock that night ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not state how many times we drank : we drank con-
</p>
<p>siderable, though.
</p>
<p>Q. Six or eight times ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. Ten times, do you think ?
</p>
<p>A. We might have drunk that many times. It was mostly ale,
</p>
<p>though, that Mr. O'Laughlin and myself drank. I hardly ever
</p>
<p>saw Mr. O'Laughlin drink any liquors.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you were not separated from him at all during the
</p>
<p>night of Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. I was not, up to the time that he went out of the house.
</p>
<p>Q. At what hour do you state that to be ?
</p>

</p>
<p>after that.

</p>
<p>Q. Can you give it in hours or half-hours ?

</p>

</p>
<p>A. We left after a certain dance by a young lady.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that O'Laughlin does not drink
</p>
<p>whiskey ?
</p>
<p>A. I have very seldom, if ever, seen him drinking any.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him drunk or intoxicated ?
</p>
<p>A. Twice, I believe.

</p>
<p>April last ?

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. In what company?
</p>
<p>A. In the company of James B. Henderson, Michael O'Laugh-

</p>
<p>A. About five o'clock in the afternoon.

<p>Q. State, then, all that took place that evening up to bedtime,
</p>
<p>and where O'Laughlin went.
</p>
<p>A. We came from the depot down to Bullman's ; there we took
</p>
<p>a drink or two, and started from there to the Metropolitan. We
</p>
<p>went to several places, and took supper at Welch's, about eight
</p>
<p>o'clock, or somewhere in that neighborhood : it may have been from
</p>
<p>half-past seven to eight.
</p>
<p>Q. How long do you suppose you were occupied there at sup-
</p>

</p>
<p>there ?

<p>Q. And, after you left there, where did you go ?
</p>
<p>A. After we left there, we came down to Bullman's again ; and
</p>
<p>there we met, I think, John Loughran, and took a walk up the
</p>
<p>street to see the illumination of the Treasury : we stopped on the
</p>
<p>corner of Ninth Street and the avenue.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you certain it was Ninth Street?
</p>

</p>
<p>half-past eleven or twelve o'clock. Then we started from there
</p>
<p>down to Riddle's, on the corner of B and Second Streets, I think,

<p>the avenue ; took a hack there, and went to the corner of Tenth
</p>
<p>Street and the avenue.

</p>
<p>the street to Gilson's, on the corner of Sixth Street, and got a
</p>
<p>drink ; and the conversation we had made it about half-past two
</p>
<p>when we got to bed.
</p>
<p>Q. Do I understand you to say that Michael O'Laughlin was
</p>
<p>with you all that time ?
</p>
<p>A. He was with us all that time.
</p>
<p>Q. From the time you all left the cars until you all went to
</p>
<p>bed?
</p>
<p>A. No : he left us for about five minutes at one time with
</p>
<p>Early, and went up as far as the National Hotel. That was when
</p>
<p>we first came down, while Henderson was getting shaved ;' and, be-
</p>
<p>fore Henderson was shaved, they were back. They were not gone
</p>
<p>more than five or six minutes. I did not go with them, but waited
</p>
<p>at RuUman's until they came back. It was the only time O'Laugh-

</p>
<p>portion of that time ?

<p>A. He was no nearer than the corner of Ninth Street and the
</p>
<p>avenue to Secretary Stanton's house.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him on Friday ?
</p>
<p>A. I was with him all day Friday, up to eight o'clock at night,
</p>
<p>when three or four of the party left, and went to supper ; and I
</p>
<p>went to the Metropolitan Hotel, and did not see him again until

</p>
<p>in good spbits, or did he betray any nervousness or anxiety, or any
</p>
<p>knowledge of any thing desperate going on ?

<p>A. I never saw him in better spirits in my life than he was then.

<p>Q. State whether it was the plan of your party to go up to Bal-
</p>
<p>timore on Friday afternoon.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was our intention to go up on Friday afternoon,

<p>night ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know exactly how the hall is an-anged. We wont
</p>
<p>to the fifty-cent place first, I believe. There was some mistake in

</p>
<p>the change : Captain Henderson went to get it corrected, and they
</p>
<p>said they would give him tickets for the orchestra chairs, which were

<p>moved from the place where we first sat into those other seats.

</p>
<p>Q. What was O'Laughlin's conduct and bearing that evening?
</p>
<p>Was he in good spirits or bad ?
</p>
<p>A. He appeared very lively. I believe they made a remark
</p>
<p>that they had come down from Baltimore to see the illumination,
</p>
<p>and have a good time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he at all intoxicated ?
</p>
<p>A. On Thursday evening, I do not think he was. He was lively
</p>
<p>and merry ; but I cannot say he was tight or drunk.
</p>
<p>No cross-examination.

<p>Thomas Cottingham
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, Mary E. Surratt.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state again the precise language that Lloyd used
</p>
<p>in his confession to you with reference to Mrs. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate objected to the repetition of this question
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken stated that he proposed to follow it up by asking the
</p>
<p>witness whether he had not made a different statement to him [Mr.
</p>
<p>Aiken] with reference to what Mr. Lloyd had said.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. Ask him what he said
</p>
<p>to you.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken [to the witness]. I ask you what I stated to you.
</p>
<p>The Witness. If the Court will allow me, I should like to tell
</p>
<p>the whole conversation. I met Mr. Aiken at the Metropolitan Hotel
</p>
<p>on Saturday evening last, I think. He asked me to take a drink.
</p>
<p>I went up, and drank with him. He then said, *' I am going to
</p>
<p>have you as a witness in this case." He asked me to sit down on a
</p>
<p>sofa, and have some conversation. I said no, it would not look well
</p>
<p>for me to be sitting there : but I would go outside and take a walk.
</p>
<p>When we went outside, the first question Mr. Aiken put to me was,
</p>
<p>whether I was a Catholic. I said I was not. We walked along ;
</p>
<p>and he said, ' ' Lloyd has made a confession to you. ' ' Said I, ' ' Yes. ' '
</p>
<p>He then said, "Will you not state that confession tome?" I
</p>
<p>declined to do it, but told him he might ask any questions, and I
</p>
<p>would answer them. He put the question to me, if Lloyd had

</p>
<p>stated that Mrs. Surratt had come down there, and told him to
</p>
<p>have the fire-arms ready. I said not. I had an object in that
</p>
<p>216 TEE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>answer. I am now on my oath ; and when I have been put on my
</p>
<p>oath I have spoken the truth, and I can have witnesses to prove what
</p>
<p>I say,  six cavalrymen, jMt. Lloyd's wife, and Mrs. Offutt. He
</p>
<p>wanted to pick out of me in the case. That is not my business,
</p>
<p>I am an officer, and I did not want to let him know any thing on
</p>
<p>either side : I wanted to come here to the Court, and state every
</p>
<p>thing that I knew. I told him distinctly that I would not give him
</p>
<p>that confession ; that I had no right to do so.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mk. Aiken.] Did I ask you if Mr. Lloyd, in his confes-
</p>
<p>sion, said any thing at all in reference to JVLrs. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. You asked me first whether Lloyd had made a confession to
</p>
<p>me ; and I said, " Yes." Said you, " What is that confession? I
</p>
<p>should like to know it." My answer to you was, " I decline
</p>
<p>giving you that confession ; but, if you will ask a question, I will
</p>
<p>answer you." That question you put to me, and I answered: I
</p>
<p>said, "No."
</p>
<p>Q. That ^L". Lloyd did not say so ?
</p>
<p>A. I did say so. I do not deny that.
</p>
<p>Q. Then what did you tell me this afternoon with reference to
</p>
<p>it?
</p>
<p>A. I told you the same thing over again in the court-room when
</p>
<p>you asked me, before I came upon the stand. It is a pai-t of my
</p>
<p>business  I am a detective officer  to gain my object. I obtained
</p>
<p>the confession from Lloyd through strategy.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you gave me to understand, and you are ready now
</p>
<p>to swear to it, that you told me a lie ?
</p>
<p>A. Undoubtedly I told you a lie there ; for I thought you had
</p>
<p>no business to ask me.
</p>
<p>Q. No business ? As my witness, had I not a right to have the
</p>
<p>truth from you ?
</p>
<p>A. I told you you might call me into Court ; and I state here
</p>
<p>that I flid lie to you ; but, when put on my oath, I told the truth.

</p>
<p>Q. Did you see O'Laugblin in Baltimore oq the Sunday after

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether or not he had been informed that

</p>
<p>A. That is what he told me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he tell you whether he was going to surrender himself
</p>
<p>up?
</p>
<p>A. He told me he was going to surrender himself on the Mon-

</p>
<p>George B. Woods,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mary E. Surratt, being duly sworn,
</p>
<p>testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. TThere do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In Boston.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been in the habit, while in Boston, of seeing pho-
</p>
<p>tographs of the leaders of the Rebellion exposed for sale there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Freely exposed ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : photographs of celebrities generally ; the same
</p>
<p>rebel as Union celebrities, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you often seen them in the possession of persons sup-
</p>
<p>posed to be loyal ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question
</p>
<p>as immaterial.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken waived the question.
</p>
<p>The Commission then adjourned until to-morrow (Friday) , May
</p>
<p>26, at ten o'clock, a.m.

<p>Feidat, May 26, 1865.

</p>
<p>218 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Court to recall Van Steinacker, one of the witnesses for the pros-
</p>
<p>ecution, for the purpose of a further cross-examination. She states,
</p>
<p>in support of her motion, that facts have come to her knowledge
</p>
<p>since the examination of the said witness, which will, she thinks,
</p>
<p>enable her to contradict him on material points of his evidence.
</p>
<p>Mary E. Sureatt.
</p>
<p>By Frederick A. Aiken, her counsel.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Adtocate Bixgham stated that there had
</p>
<p>been no precipe filed by any of the accused for a summons requir-
</p>
<p>ing the attendance of Van Steinacker as a witness. He had been
</p>
<p>discharo-ed from attendance as a witness, and was no lono-er under
</p>
<p>the control of the Government. If the accused summoned Van
</p>
<p>Steinacker as a witness, every effort would be made to procure his
</p>
<p>attendance.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken stated that the accused did not wish to summon him
</p>
<p>as a witness on their behalf, but to cross-examine him.
</p>
<p>The Commission refused to entertain the application at the pres-
</p>
<p>ent, a subpoena for Tan Steinacker not being asked for.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett produced (in accordance
</p>
<p>with a request of the counsel for the accused, Mary E. Surratt) a
</p>
<p>letter signed by " M. E. Surratt, administratrix of J. H. Surratt,"
</p>
<p>and addressed to Mr. John Nothey ; and also a letter dated " Biv-

</p>
<p>acter.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever heard her, in all her intercourse with you,

<p>express any disloyal sentiments on any occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. Never. I do not recollect of ever hearing. her speaking on

<p>the question.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you in your intercourse with her, or can you state to

</p>
<p>Q. You never have been present with her when she has been

<p>unable to recognize her friends at a little distance ?

<p>'' Dear Madam,  During a late visit to the lower portion'of the
</p>
<p>county, I ascertained of the willingness of Mr. Nothey to settle

<p>THE TRIAL. 223
</p>
<p>with you ; and desire to call your attention to tlae fact, in urging
</p>
<p>the settlement of the claim of my late father's estate. However
</p>
<p>unpleasant, I must insist upon closing up this matter, as is impera-
</p>
<p>tive in an early settlement of the estate, which is necessary.
</p>
<p>" You will, therefore, please inform me, at your earliest conve-
</p>
<p>nience, as to how and when you will be able to pay the balance
</p>
<p>remaining due on the land purchased by your late husband.

</p>
<p>Q. Were you at Surrattsville on the 14th of April last ?
</p>
<p>A. No, su*.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know, from your knowledge, that, in obedience to
</p>
<p>that letter, Mrs. Surratt went there ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>and it was waived.

<p>William L. Hoyle,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In Washington : No. 58, Missouri Avenue.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. I have a store acquaintance with her.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with her general character ?
</p>
<p>A. Not particularly. I know nothing of her,  only a store
</p>
<p>acquaintance. I have heard nothing against her.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you met her many times yourself?
</p>
<p>A. Only in the store. I have not met her otherwise.

<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>224 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>as the witness had stated distinctly that he did not know any thing
</p>
<p>about it.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Have you ever heard IMrs. Surratt express
</p>
<p>any disloyal sentiments in your presence V
</p>
<p>A. I have not, nor any other in this Rebellion, but very seldom.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. And never heard her utter any loyal sentiments?
</p>
<p>A. I never have, either loyal or disloyal. It was only as a cus-
</p>
<p>tomer that I knew her.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Then you never had any political conversation with her?
</p>
<p>A. I never had.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you are acquainted with
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt?
</p>
<p>A. I know him by sight. I know nothing further of him.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you last see him in this city?
</p>
<p>A. I think, about the latter part of February or the first of
</p>
<p>March : to the best of my knowledge, just prior to the draft. I
</p>
<p>am not posted exactly as to when the draft took place ; but it was
</p>
<p>prior to the draft that I saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you give a description of his personal appearance ?
</p>
<p>A. So far as I can, I will. He is a tall, delicate-looking man,
</p>
<p>rather light complected ; I should think, about between twenty and
</p>
<p>twenty-two or twenty-three years of age ; about six feet in height,
</p>
<p>and rather delicate in his appearance. That is as far as I could
</p>
<p>describe him, for my life.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he wear a goatee or mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot say, for I never noticed particular enough to
</p>
<p>know that ; but I really think he had none when I saw him last,
</p>
<p>though I would not be positive about it.
</p>
<p>Q. And you think you saw him last about the first of March ?
</p>
<p>A. A few days prior to the draft, I saw him in the store, and

</p>
<p>then only saw him for a few moments.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. He was a slender man, was he not?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 'I'lb
</p>
<p>A. A tall, delicate man.
</p>
<p>Q. But was be not slender?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; rather slender.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know that he was over five feet nine inches in height ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know positively ; but from his appearance I should
</p>
<p>think he was.
</p>
<p>P. H. Maulsby,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Michael O'Laughlin, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Cox :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court where you reside, and what your
</p>
<p>occupation is ?
</p>
<p>A. I reside in Baltimore : I am a clerk.
</p>
<p>Q. To whom ?
</p>
<p>A. I am with Eaton Brothers & Company.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you related to the accused, Michael O'Laughlin ?
</p>
<p>A. I am his brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state when Michael O'Laughlin came to Baltimore
</p>
<p>from the South ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I could state positively the month : I
</p>
<p>think it was in August, 1862.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what his occupation lias been from that time
</p>
<p>to the present?
</p>
<p>A. When he returned in 18G2, he remained at home for the
</p>
<p>space of about a month. He came home somewhat sick. He then
</p>
<p>went with his brother, who was in business in the city of Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, in the produce and feed business. He remained with him until
</p>
<p>the fall of 18G3.
</p>
<p>Q. Did his brother remove from Washington at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I think his brotlier made a sale of his place here in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton rather later than that ; but he removed from here, leaving his
</p>
<p>houee as a branch business with his Baltimore business ; and
</p>
<p>Michael attended to his business for him up to the 14th of March,

</p>
<p>I think it was, of this year ; that is, there were evidences of debt
</p>
<p>226 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>that Michael had the collection of, and receiving orders from cus-
</p>
<p>tomers here, which his brother supplied from Baltimore.
</p>
<p>Q. Did his engagements for his brother require him to be ia
</p>
<p>Washino-ton then ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think they did. I could not say positively how
</p>
<p>frequently he came to Washington ; but he was here off and on for
</p>
<p>that period, from the time his brother gave up business here until
</p>
<p>the 14th of March.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I knew him intimately.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he intimate with the family of the accused, Michael
</p>
<p>O'Laughhn?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Booth owns the property, and resided opposite our
</p>
<p>house for four years. The boys, Michael and William, were school-
</p>
<p>mates of John Booth. They attended school at a Mr. Smith's,
</p>
<p>whose school was not veiy far from our house, on the other side of
</p>
<p>the street.
</p>
<p>Q. How long has the intimacy continued between them ?
</p>
<p>A. To my positive knowledge, it has been about twelve years.
</p>
<p>Q. It, then, has not been of recent origin?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was Michael's home in Baltimore after he left Wash-
</p>
<p>ington ?
</p>
<p>A. He lived with me at No. 57, North Exeter Street.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state where he was during the month of April before
</p>
<p>the 13th of April?
</p>
<p>A. From the 18th of March until he came down to Washington,-
</p>
<p>on the 13th of April, he was with me.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you speak with certainty about his being at home during
</p>
<p>that time, or any part of that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I can speak with certainty from the 30th of March or the 1st
</p>
<p>of x\pril to the 12th of April. I am positive alout that.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what you know of his whereabouts during the

</p>
<p>A. On the 7th of March, I am positive he was at liome, and
</p>
<p>remained at home for some days : how many I am not able to state
</p>
<p>posi'/ively.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 227
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of his being sent to Washington by his
</p>
<p>brother ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time ?
</p>
<p>A. On the 13th of March ; and his brother telegraphed him on
</p>
<p>the 14th. He told him on the 13th that there was an order to send
</p>
<p>a car-load of hay to a gentleman by the name of McCarthy here,
</p>
<p>but he was not positive as to his ability to get a car, and he would
</p>
<p>telegraph him when he got it ; and on the 14th he telegraphed him
</p>
<p>that the hay was sent, and for him to look out for it.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a telegraphic despatch to the witness.] I ask you
</p>
<p>to look at this, and state whether that is the handwriting of his
</p>
<p>brother.
</p>
<p>A. This is not the handwriting of his brother ; but it is a copy
</p>
<p>of the telejrram sent to Michael on the 14th of March.
</p>
<p>The telegram was read, as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Baltimore, March 14, 1865.
</p>
<p>''To M. 0' Laughlin, Franklin Hotel, Washington, D. C, 
</p>
<p>" We have shipped McCarthy's hay. Look out for it to-morrow.
</p>
<p>" S. W. Laugiilin."
</p>
<p>[The original of the foregoing telegram was offered in evidence
</p>
<p>without objection.]
</p>
<p>Q. When did he return to Baltimore then ?
</p>
<p>A. He returned, as well as I can recollect, on the succeeding
</p>
<p>Saturday. I am not positive as to the date ; but he returned on
</p>
<p>the succeeding Saturday.
</p>
<p>Q. The 14th of March was on Tuesday ; and you say he re-
</p>
<p>turned on the following Saturday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, as well as my recollection serves me.
</p>
<p>Q, Do I understand you to say, that from, the time he came
</p>
<p>back, to the best of your recollection, he remained at home until he
</p>
<p>came down to Washington, on the 12th or 13th of April ?
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where he was during the month of February ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not state positively. He was home on the 7th and

<p>228 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>14th of February, that being St. Valentine's Day, which leads me
</p>
<p>to recollect it.
</p>
<p>Q. During that time, I -would like you to state whether he was
</p>
<p>much at home, or little, according to your recollection.
</p>
<p>A. My impression is that he was home from about the 14th for
</p>
<p>a couple of weeks. I am led to that impression by having a seam-
</p>
<p>stress at the house at the time, who remained with me about two
</p>
<p>weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she make any remarks that led you to remember it ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Cox.] I desire you to state to the Court the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of his surrender of himself, or his arrest, as the case
</p>
<p>may be, after the assassination of the President.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I felt myself 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You need not state
</p>
<p>what you thought about it yourself.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Cox.] At what time did he arrive at home after
</p>
<p>the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. He came up on Saturday evening. I saw him about seven
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Had the ofl&cers been to the house then in search of him ?
</p>
<p>A. They had.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you inform him of that ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Then what took place ?
</p>
<p>A. He told me that

</p>
<p>giving his own declaration in evidence, for the reason that he had
</p>
<p>stated yesterday, in regard to a similar question, in which he had
</p>
<p>been sustained by the Court, that, if such a rule as that were
</p>
<p>adopted and acted upon by courts, all that a guilty man would have

<p>to do, after he had committed a gi-eat crinie, would be to pour his

</p>
<p>statements into the ears of all honest people that he met up to the
</p>
<p>time of his arrest, and then prove those statements on his trial.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 229
</p>
<p>The law says that he should not do any such thing ; and he [the
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate] objected to it on that account.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox stated that he desired to prove by this witness that the
</p>
<p>prisoner, Michael O'Laughlin, was informed that the officers had
</p>
<p>been in pursuit of him ; that he informed the witness that he had
</p>
<p>an engagement on Saturday night, but would communicate with
</p>
<p>him the next day ; that, on Monday, he did send for him to come
</p>
<p>to him, and authorized him to procure an officer, and put himself in
</p>
<p>his custody ; declaring all the time his entire innocence of any
</p>
<p>complicity with this affair.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate said the witness could be instructed that
</p>
<p>he is not to give the declarations of the prisoner, but simply his acts,
</p>
<p>in evidence.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Cox.] You say you informed him on Saturday
</p>
<p>afternoon that the officers had been in search of him ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he protest his innocence ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>There was no authority in the world for such a question as that : it
</p>
<p>was a burlesque upon judicial proceedings.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox insisted on the question. If a party flees, and avoids
</p>
<p>an-est, it would certainly be receivable for the prosecution ; but if
</p>
<p>he candidly comes forward, and says, " I am not guilty, and I offer
</p>
<p>myself for investigation and trial," it should equally be receivable
</p>
<p>for the defence.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate stated that that was not the rule of law.
</p>
<p>The Government could fdve the declarations of the accused in evi-
</p>
<p>dence ; but it did not follow from that that he could.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox replied, that, where it was a part of his conduct, he
</p>
<p>could. He could not prove his innocence by declaring himself so ;
</p>
<p>but, where it was a part of his conduct, it was receivable upon the
</p>
<p>question of how far he was conscious of guilt.

</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham, in rejoinder, inquired
</p>
<p>whether the counsel would pretend to say that there was the least
</p>
<p>colorable excuse for the claim that a man charged with a crime
</p>
<p>VOL. n. 20
</p>
<p>230 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>could of his own act, especially when he finds that the officers of
</p>
<p>the law are at his door, hunt up one of his kinsmen, tell him his
</p>
<p>predicament, protest his innocence, and prove that, and then go to
</p>
<p>the officers, and surrender himself up to them, and tell them he was
</p>
<p>innocent, and prove that. Could it be possible that a man was
</p>
<p>permitted to manufacture evidence on his own motion in that way
</p>
<p>to cover his crimes ? If the Government had attempted to prove
</p>
<p>any thing that he said or did at the time of his arrest, the counsel
</p>
<p>would have a right to ask for all that he said on that occasion ; but
</p>
<p>the Government had not done any thing of the sort.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox said that was just what the Government had done, 
</p>
<p>they had attempted to prove that the accused (O'Laughlin) went
</p>
<p>away from home to avoid arrest, and that he was aiTCsted at
</p>
<p>another house.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Cox.] State to the Court whether or not on Mon-
</p>
<p>day morning the defendant, Michael O'Laughlin, authorized you to
</p>
<p>procure an officer to take him into custody ; in other words, whether
</p>
<p>he voluntarily surrendered himself.
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you known the accused, Michael O'Laughlin?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him for about twelve years ; probably longer
</p>
<p>than that.
</p>
<p>Q. I will ask you to state his disposition and character ; whether
</p>
<p>he is violent and bad-hearted, or, on the contrary, is amiable, mild-
</p>
<p>tempered, &c.
</p>
<p>A, As a boy, he was always a very timid boy. From my obser-
</p>
<p>vation of twelve years, I believe him to be the last one who would
</p>
<p>have any thing 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. What you believe is
</p>
<p>not evidence.
</p>
<p>jMr. Cox. I meant to ask the witness whether, from his knowl-

<p>edge of the accused, he believes him capable of being engaged in

<p>any thing of this sort.

<p>ty, peacefulness, &c.
</p>
<p>A. I have always regarded him as an amiable boy.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he violent on political questions ?
</p>
<p>A. I never recollect having seen him in a passion in my life.
</p>
<p>On political questions he has never been violent. I have never

<p>heard him express any opinion, except in a very moderate way, on
</p>
<p>the issues of the times.
</p>
<p>Q. There has been some testimony by Mr. Wallace about his
</p>
<p>arrest of the accused. I would like you to state the facts in regard
</p>
<p>to that alleged arrest, and what Mr. Wallace had to do with it. In
</p>
<p>the first place, I will inquire whether Michael had authorized you to
</p>
<p>go for an officer.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. That I object to.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. Then I will ask the witness whether he went for an
</p>
<p>officer, and whom he procured.
</p>
<p>A. The facts in the case are simply these : When I met Michael,
</p>
<p>I suggested to liim 
</p>
<p>. Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You need not state any
</p>
<p>thing that you said to Michael.
</p>
<p>Q. [By ]Mr. Cox.] State what you did after leaving him on
</p>
<p>Monday morning.
</p>
<p>A. On Monday morning, he sent for me, and said 
</p>
<p>' Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You need not state
</p>
<p>what he said.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Cox.] What did you do in consequence of what
</p>
<p>he said to you ?

</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox said he wanted to get at exactly the facts with reference
</p>
<p>232 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>to the manner in wbicli the arrest was made, to show that it was
</p>
<p>made at the instance of the defendant himself ; that it was virtually
</p>
<p>a surrender of himself into the custody of the officers of the law ;
</p>
<p>that the witness went and produced an officer, and took him to the
</p>
<p>house where O'Laughlin was ; and that he voluntarily came out,
</p>
<p>and surrendered himself to the officer.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham replied, that the question
</p>
<p>assumed that the accused told the witness something; ; and the wit-
</p>
<p>ness was asked to swear, that, in consequence of what the accused
</p>
<p>told him, he did something else. Tlie counsel had no right to as-
</p>
<p>sume any thing here as proof that was not proof; and more espe-
</p>
<p>cially had he no right to assume as proved what was incapable of
</p>
<p>being proved,  the declarations of his client.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox rejoined, that the whole object of the inquiry was to as-
</p>
<p>certain, for the satisfaction of the Court, whether the accused, with
</p>
<p>that consciousness of innocence which would govern a man who was
</p>
<p>innocent, did really act in accordance with that consciousness of in-
</p>
<p>nocence, which was the best evidence of innocence, by voluntarily
</p>
<p>submitting himself to the officers of justice, professing his willing-
</p>
<p>ness to submit to an investigation. If the flight, which the prose-
</p>
<p>cution have attempted to prove, was evidence of guilt, certainly it
</p>
<p>was competent for the defendant to meet that evidence by proof, on
</p>
<p>the contrary, that there was no flight, no evasion, but a voluntary
</p>
<p>submission to the officers of the law, with a view of having the
</p>
<p>merits of the case fairly tried.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham said the cou^nsel wished
</p>
<p>to prove what the Court had said should not be proved. The
</p>
<p>Court had ruled that the counsel should not prove what O'Laugh-
</p>
<p>lin had said to the witness about surrenderins; him, and he did not
</p>
<p>prove it ; but now he assumed that he did do it, and the witness
</p>
<p>was asked to state what he did in consequence of what O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>had said to him. If ever an illegal question was put in a court of
</p>
<p>justice, this was one, because it was an assumption that a thing was

</p>
<p>proved which the Court had excluded from being proved to start
</p>
<p>with. If the counsel chose to ask the witness whether he himself
</p>
<p>had surrendered the accused to an officer, he would not object
</p>
<p>to that.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 233
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate said that the witness might be asked if he
</p>
<p>did it himself, or if he did it by the prisoner's authority.
</p>
<p>JMr. Cox. That is what I want to prove, and I will vary the
</p>
<p>question to read as follows : 
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you surrendered the accused into the custody
</p>
<p>of an officer by the authority of the accused himself.
</p>
<p>A. I did, sir ; most certainly.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take the officer to the house where O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>was ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I would be very glad to state to the Court all the
</p>
<p>circumstances surrounding the case. I was proceeding to state that
</p>
<p>I had seen the accused on Saturday evening, and an arrangement
</p>
<p>was then made, as I understood it, for Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox [at the suggestion of the Judge Advocate] stated to
</p>
<p>the witness that his statement should be confined to what was done,
</p>
<p>and should not include w'feit the accused had said to him.
</p>
<p>A. I shall endeavor to do so. On Saturday evening, at seven
</p>
<p>o'clock, I met Mr. O'Laughlin and Mr. Early together. They had
</p>
<p>then just returned from Washington. It is difficult for me to make
</p>
<p>up a connected narrative of the case without stating the remarks
</p>
<p>made to me by Michael.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. The witness can only
</p>
<p>state what he did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox [to the witness]. State what passed between you
</p>
<p>and Officer Wallace.
</p>
<p>K. I saw Mr. Wallace for the first time on Sunday, at my
</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he come there in search of the accused ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : he came there in search of Michael. Other officers were
</p>
<p>with him at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. I think you also stated that officers had been there on Satur-
</p>
<p>day, before Michael returned home?
</p>
<p>A. I believe they had been. I did not see them. I was not

</p>
<p>at home. On Monday, I was sent for by Michael.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you go then for an officer?
</p>
<p>A. I went for a hack, and called for Mr. Wallace at Carmichael's
</p>
<p>office as a prudential measure only. Mr. Wallace was not aware of
</p>
<p>20*
</p>
<p>234 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>his whereabouts at that time. As feeling ran very high at that time,
</p>
<p>I supposed that would be the best course to pursue. I took a hack
</p>
<p>at Monument Square as we passed Carmichael's office, and Mr. Wal-'
</p>
<p>lace went with us.
</p>
<p>Q. "Who else was with you ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. James S. Allison was with me. We then went to
</p>
<p>Monument Square, and took a hack there. Mr. Early and Mr.
</p>
<p>Allison and Mr. Wallace remained in the hack, while I went into the
</p>
<p>house, and Michael came out with me. After we got into the hack,
</p>
<p>I introduced him to the two gentlemen ; and, as far as my knowledge
</p>
<p>goes, there was nothing said from that time until we reached the
</p>
<p>marshal's office.
</p>
<p>Q. I think you stated, in your examination, that on Saturday
</p>
<p>evening 3Iichael told you he had an engagement with a friend that
</p>
<p>night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he told me that.
</p>
<p>Q. I ask you to state, further, whether he offered to inform you
</p>
<p>where he could be found that night, if wanted.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Adyocate BiNGmvM objected to the question,
</p>
<p>and the Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. If the Court please, there are several questions I
</p>
<p>should like to ask in reo-ard to Booth himself I do not know
</p>
<p>whether the questions will be objected to. I desire to show 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. State your question.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Cox.] Did you knosv Booth intimately ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether he was a man of pleasing address.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to all that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. What I desire to show to the Court, and what all
</p>
<p>the counsel desire, is to have some evidence as to the character of
</p>
<p>this man, John Wilkes Booth. There is nothing in the case yet
</p>
<p>to reflect any light at all on that question. If any of these accused
</p>
<p>should be found guilty of association with him in this serious crime,

</p>
<p>Booth's influence upon them, whatever it may have been, would
</p>
<p>not affect the question of their innocence ; but it is a consideration
</p>
<p>which goes in mitigation of their guilt, that Booth was a man who
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 235
</p>
<p>naturally acquired a gi'eat ascendency over young men with wbom he
</p>
<p>was associated. He was a man who had great influence over them,
</p>
<p>and could warp them from the right by means of his control over
</p>
<p>them ; and my desire is to introduce some evidence on that subject,
</p>
<p>and it is the desire of all the counsel for the defence. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion which I propound to the witness is a prehminary question,
</p>
<p>designed to introduce that subject.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. It does not mitigate the assassination
</p>
<p>at all that it was performed by a man of fascinating addiess and
</p>
<p>pleasing manners.
</p>
<p>3Ir. Cox. No; but it mitigates the acts of the other parties
</p>
<p>that they were acting under his influence.
</p>
<p>The Judge xAlDvocate. Not at all.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. You have stated what the occupation of O'Laughlin has
</p>
<p>been since August, 1862 : can you state what occupation he was
</p>
<p>engaged in for the year previous ?
</p>
<p>A. From 1861 to 1862, he was in the rebel army.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox. I will state to the Court that I only went into those
</p>
<p>dates to show that there was an error in the date of O'Lauo-hlin's
</p>
<p>return in the statement of Mr. McPhail.
</p>
<p>The Witness. As I stated, Michael returned in x\ugust, 1862.
</p>
<p>I am not positive about the month ; but it was in the year 1862.

</p>
<p>they stopped about ten feet from me ; and I heard Cleary say, " I

</p>
<p>won't trouble them much longer." Cleary said, "Is every thing

</p>
<p>A. I am ; with bis signature.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at that card, and see if that is his signature [submitting
</p>
<p>to the witness the card identified by Mr. A. Browning as having
</p>
<p>been left at the Kirkwood House by J. Wilkes Booth].
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is undoubtedly his signature.

<p>Charles Sweenay,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State where is your home.
</p>
<p>A. In New- York State.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been in the army during the present war?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been a prisoner of war?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. For how long a time ?
</p>
<p>A. The first time I was taken, I was a prisoner two months and
</p>
<p>ten days.
</p>
<p>Q. Whereat?
</p>
<p>A. In Libby. The second time, I was fifteen months a prison-
</p>
<p>er, of which I was not quite two months at Belle-Isle Hospital,
</p>
<p>near Richmond ; and then they took me to Georgia.
</p>
<p>Q. T\Tiere were you kept a prisoner in Georgia ?
</p>
<p>A. At Anderson ville.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you stay there ?
</p>
<p>A. They kept me there, I judge, about six months before we
</p>
<p>were moved to Savannah.
</p>
<p>Q. State how you were treated in all those prisons.
</p>
<p>A. At Belle Island, I had not half a pound of bread a day, and
</p>
<p>once in a while I got a little rice soup,  but very little rice : it
</p>
<p>was very scattered in the cup. For about six weeks, on the island,
</p>
<p>I do not believe I had a piece of meat as big as that (indicating
</p>
<p>with his hands a piece about two inches in length) . When I went

<p>to hospital, the grub was a little better ; the bread was a little bet-
</p>
<p>ter : but the meat was very small ; there was not much of that.

<p>242 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>They pretty near starved me at Riehraond. After leaving Rlcli-
</p>
<p>mond. when I first went to Andersonville, and for about four or
</p>
<p>five months, they gave a pretty good-sized ration of the kind it was.
</p>
<p>I had all that I wanted to eat in corn-meal ; but the bacon was
</p>
<p>pretty strong. When it came to August and October, they began
</p>
<p>to cut down our ration, and our allowance was pretty short. Well,
</p>
<p>we made out to live the best way we could. Old Captain Wurtz
</p>
<p>there had told the guard that they must shoot every Yankee whom
</p>
<p>they could catch with his hand or his head over the dead-line ; and
</p>
<p>every one who did so would get a furlough of forty days to go
</p>
<p>home. So they used to kill our men the same as though they
</p>
<p>were brutes. I saw a cripple, a one-legged man, get shot there.
</p>
<p>We were digging tunnels, and doing one thing and another to try
</p>
<p>to make our escape. There was a one-legged man who told the
</p>
<p>captain about that. Some of the boys got down on him, and abused
</p>
<p>him ; and he ran inside of the dead-line next the gate, so as to get
</p>
<p>protection from the guard ; and Captain Wurtz stood on the post,
</p>
<p>and told the guard, if they did not shoot that man, he would shoot
</p>
<p>the guard. So the guard had to shoot the man. I had a brother
</p>
<p>at Andersonville who was very sick and dying. For about eight
</p>
<p>days, to my knowledge, he had nothing to eat : he could not eat
</p>
<p>their corn-meal and what they gave him. It was not fit for a dog
</p>
<p>to eat. I had a little money that I used to gather alx)ut the camp,
</p>
<p>and I bought a few biscuits to feed him on ; but I could not make
</p>
<p>money enough to feed him long : so he lay in his tent, and starved
</p>
<p>there. I went to the doctor, and said, " Doctor, I wish you could
</p>
<p>see my brother in the tent: he is dying."  " No; I cannot do it,"
</p>
<p>were the words he said. Before he died, he told me, "Dear
</p>
<p>brother, keep good courage : never take an oath to that Grovern-
</p>
<p>ment ; stick to your Government." I told him I would, and I
</p>
<p>have done it. I made my escape. The first time I escaped, after
</p>
<p>I got over the stockade, they caught me, and fetched me back, and
</p>
<p>gagged me for six hours. It was very cold ; and, when I got up, I

</p>
<p>could hardly walk. I went to hospital and got well in the month
</p>
<p>of June, and able to be up ; and I thought I would try to make
</p>
<p>my escape, and got to Stoneman, for I heard there was a raid. I
</p>
<p>got out of hospital, and travelled that night in the mud and swamps
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 243
</p>
<p>clear up to my neck ; and I got four miles. The pickets came across
</p>
<p>me, caught me, and took me back to Captain Winder. Captain
</p>
<p>Winder told them to take me, and put me in the stockade with a ball
</p>
<p>and chain. They took me up to Captain Wurtz's headquarters,
</p>
<p>and put me in the stockade all day, in the hot sun, with my arms
</p>
<p>stretched out. The sun affected me so much that day, that, after
</p>
<p>they released me from the stockade, the next day I got sick, and
</p>
<p>was for six days so that I could not eat or drink any thing, and
</p>
<p>came pretty near dying. It is only Grod who has let me live this
</p>
<p>long.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear the speech made by General Cobb at Ander-
</p>
<p>son ville ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes. Greneral Cobb came there on the 4th day of March,
</p>
<p>18G5. The guards around there were old men and boys that never
</p>
<p>knew any thing. General Cobb preached up to the guard about
</p>
<p>the way the war went on. He pointed to the stockade, and said,
</p>
<p>" You see this big graveyard : all those in the stockade will be in
</p>
<p>the gi-aveyard before long." He expected we were all going to be
</p>
<p>starved to death if we were held long enough ; and he said they
</p>
<p>would be perished to death before they ever came back to the Union
</p>
<p>again. He said that they would hang Old Abe if they caught him,
</p>
<p>as he supposed Old Abe would hang him, or do something to him,
</p>
<p>if he caught him.

</p>
<p>Q. Have you been a prisoner of war during that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>A. I was confined nine months and two days in all. I was in
</p>
<p>Anderson ville, Ga., and Charleston and Florence, S.C.
</p>
<p>244 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. State the treatment which you and other prisoners of war
</p>
<p>received from the Confederate authorities during your confinement,
</p>
<p>especially in regard to food.
</p>
<p>A. At Andersonville, the biggest portion of the rations was
</p>
<p>cooked there ; they were cooked in a very inferior way ; corn-bread
</p>
<p>and mush and rice boiled, and boiled bacon.
</p>
<p>Q. How were they as to quantity ?
</p>
<p>A. The quantity of bread we would receive would be a piece
</p>
<p>about four inches long, three wide, and two thick, for twenty-four
</p>
<p>hours.
</p>
<p>Q. And what with that ?
</p>
<p>A. We would get about from two to three ounces of boiled pork.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the effect of this upon the health of the prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. It was very injurious to the health. The men were wasting
</p>
<p>all the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they die in large numbers ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the average number of deaths during your stay at
</p>
<p>Andersonville ?
</p>
<p>A. The report for August was, I understood, 3,044 deaths
</p>
<p>during that month.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you in the open sun, without any shelter at all ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; without any shelter.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the heat extreme ?
</p>
<p>A. Very extreme ; warm in the day, but cool nights.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the character of the water which they gave you to
</p>
<p>drink?
</p>
<p>A. The water was very poor, and bad treatment used before it
</p>
<p>came into camp.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it infected by the garbage and filth thrown into it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; at a cook-house they had on the spring above our
</p>
<p>camp.
</p>
<p>Q. This ground was a kind of marsh, was it not ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : there was a creek ran through the centre of it on
</p>
<p>each side.
</p>
<p>Q. How far was it from there to the woodland, where you might'
</p>
<p>have had shelter from the sun ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. ' 245
</p>
<p>A. There was woodland all around us. The stockade where wo
</p>
<p>were in the wood was chopped out of it.
</p>
<p>Q. It was quite near you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it higher ground than you were upon ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; somewhat higher.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you there during the cold weather ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir: I was in Florence, S.C., during the cold weather.
</p>
<p>We were removed from Andersonville at the time Atlanta fell, 
</p>
<p>those that were able to be taken away.
</p>
<p>Q. What were the declarations made by the keepers of the
</p>
<p>prison when complaints were made ? Did you hear what was
</p>
<p>said ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard any thing at Andersonville. At Florence, I
</p>
<p>heard some hard threats made against the " Yanks," as they called
</p>
<p>us there. They threatened to starve us. As our cavalry was raid-
</p>
<p>ing and destro^'ing their country, they would starve us in retaliation,
</p>
<p>they said,
</p>
<p>Q. Did you receive the same kind of treatment at Florence as
</p>
<p>at Andersonville ?
</p>
<p>A. We received worse at Florence, and got less rations.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the amount of food given you sufficient to sustain life
</p>
<p>for any long period of time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : it was not. Men that were destitute of any little
</p>
<p>means of their own  such as money or trinkets or watches 
</p>
<p>ran down, and kept running down, till they died. I had some
</p>
<p>money ; and I bought some extra provisions, and kept my health
</p>
<p>tolerably good. I kept up. The last ten days that I was with the
</p>
<p>rebels, I drew two pints of meal.
</p>
<p>Q. At what other points were you imprisoned ?
</p>
<p>A. About three weeks in Charleston. We were used very well
</p>
<p>there, with the exception of shooting our men where they were
</p>
<p>enclosed inside of the guards.

<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>A. It seemed to be encouraged.

<p>246 ' THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of any man being rebuked or punished for
</p>
<p>such shooting.
</p>
<p>A. Never. It was a general report in camp that the rebs offered
</p>
<p>their men a thirty-day furlough for every "Yank" they would
</p>
<p>shoot inside of the stockade that was at Andersonville.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Who was the officer in command at Charleston at the time
</p>
<p>you were there ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot tell.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know what general officers were there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I was not long enough there to get acquainted
</p>
<p>with the officers.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not hear ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.

<p>John S. Young,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows :

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In New York.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not you knew Robert
</p>
<p>C. Kennedy, who was hanged in the city of New York some time
</p>
<p>since ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember when he was executed ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, on the 25th of March last.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, before he was executed, he
</p>
<p>made a confession, which was afterwards published in the papers of
</p>
<p>the country ?

</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. The Court will remember that this is the
</p>
<p>Kennedy, who, it has already been shown, was claimed by Thompson
</p>
<p>and others to have been acting under Confederate authority in firing
</p>
<p>the city of New York ; and I wish to read his confession as to that
</p>
<p>crime.
</p>
<p>The statement produced by the witness was then read, as fol-
</p>
<p>lows : 
</p>
<p>*' Toronto, C. W., Dec. 25, 1864.
</p>
<p>^'Major-General John A. Dix, commanding Department of the
</p>
<p>East.
</p>
<p>" Sir,  It having come to our knowledge that a large number
</p>
<p>of persons have been placed under arrest by your order, charged
</p>
<p>with being connected with the recent attempt to fire the hotels in
</p>
<p>the city of New York, and among whom is one Benjamin A. Mc-
</p>
<p>Donald, we, the undersigned, from a sense of duty we owe to B.
</p>
<p>A. McDonald, and others innocently accused, beg leave to submit
</p>
<p>for your consideration the following statement, hoping it may be the
</p>
<p>means of the speedy release of the said McDonald, who, we most
</p>
<p>solemnly attest, is wholly innocent of the charges preferred against
</p>
<p>him, or of any Jcnowledge of the intention of the undersigned to
</p>
<p>fire the hotels in your city. The entire plan was originated and
</p>
<p>matured in Canada ; and all the arrangements for phosphorus, and
</p>
<p>other material necessary for the purpose, were perfected before we
</p>
<p>started on the expedition. Before starting, however, two or three
</p>
<p>of us were furnished with letters of introduction to McDonald by
</p>
<p>his brother in Canada, simply stating, in substance, that the bearers
</p>
<p>visited New York for business-purposes, and requested that he would
</p>
<p>see that they were comfortably quartered, as they were strangers in the
</p>
<p>city, and might need his advice. The introduction was honored ;
</p>
<p>and through him two of the undersigned procured lodgings with a
</p>
<p>Mrs. , who occupies the dwelling-part of the house No. 3,

</p>
<p>asked the privilege of depositing our funds in the safe of the com-

<p>248 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>pany, and was referred to Mr. Colwell, the treasurer of the concern,
</p>
<p>who permitted us to do so ; and afterwards, whenever we had occa-
</p>
<p>sion to use some of the money, we applied to Mr. Colwell, and
</p>
<p>never, to our knowledge, to Mr. McDonald ; and whatever time was
</p>
<p>spent in the rooms of the company was in the society of Mr.
</p>
<p>C. and other members and employes of the concern. We almost
</p>
<p>invariably found McDonald busy, and seldom passed more than the
</p>
<p>time of day with him ; and we most solemnly assert and declare,
</p>
<p>that never, to our positive knowledge, did we, or either of us, ever com-
</p>
<p>municate to said McDonald, either by word of mouth or in writing,
</p>
<p>the object of our -vdsit to the city, or in any way intimate, or by
</p>
<p>means of words, signs, or otherwise, lead him to conjecture, the
</p>
<p>object of our mission ; and if said McDonald did know of our inten-
</p>
<p>tion, it was purely conjecture ; but we assert that he did not and
</p>
<p>could not have known, as nothing ever passed between us on the
</p>
<p>subject, upon which he could even base a belief.
</p>
<p>*' We are alone responsible ; and, as we did not fear to make the
</p>
<p>attempt, we shall not seek through dishonorable means to evade the
</p>
<p>consequences. We were all strictly enjoined not to hazard a word
</p>
<p>as to the object of our visit to Mr. McDonald ; and we all solemnly
</p>
<p>assert that we did not.
</p>
<p>" The circumstance of finding a small sum of money and the
</p>
<p>baggage of two of the undersigned in the possession of said IMc-
</p>
<p>Donald is very easily explained, and will show how innocently he
</p>
<p>became the custodian of the same, and which fact is now held by
</p>
<p>yourself to be one of the strongest convincing proofs - of his guilt.
</p>
<p>On Friday we told Mr. McDonald that it was our intention to visit
</p>
<p>Philadelphia for a day or two, and, as we did not wish to be
</p>
<p>troubled with our bao-o-ao-e, asked if he would take charo-e of it until
</p>
<p>our return, which he did not hesitate to do ; and after the occur-
</p>
<p>rence of the fire, feeling that it would not be safe or prudent for us
</p>
<p>to call for it, Mr, Wilhams, one of the undersigned, addressed him
</p>
<p>a note, requesting him to forward to us by express our baggage and

<p>the small sum of money deposited with him. Knowing us to have
</p>
<p>come from Canada, and our abrupt departure immediately after the

<p>fires, and our informal, and, it may be stated, unusual mode of
</p>
<p>leaving, may have led Mr. McDonald to suspicion us ; but further

<p>than this he could have known nothing. This we most positively
</p>
<p>assert was the whole sum of his knowledge or participation in

<p>the matter.

</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I was not present when it was made. There was

<p>j
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. About fifteen miles down, in Prince George's County.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether or not you purchased
</p>
<p>some land from Mr. Surratt ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I purchased seventy-five acres of land from Mr.
</p>
<p>John Surratt  the old gentleman  some years ago,
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Gwynn bring a letter to you on the 14th of April
</p>
<p>last?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was the letter from ?
</p>
<p>A. From Mrs. Surratt.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been in the habit lately of meeting Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>at Surrattsville ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : only that one time. She sent me word that she
</p>
<p>was coming down there on Tuesday, and that she wanted me to
</p>
<p>come there, and to settle for this piece of land. I owed her part
</p>
<p>of the money on it, and she wanted me to settle for it. That was
</p>
<p>my business with her, and her business with me. That was all I
</p>
<p>ever had to do with her ; and that was the only time -I saw her.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not see her on Friday, the 14th of April ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I only saw her on that Tuesday, in regard to this
</p>
<p>land.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 251
</p>
<p>Q. What is your profession ?
</p>
<p>A. I am a physician.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you been practising ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been practising for nineteen years.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you are or are not a
</p>
<p>brother of Mr. Daniel Thomas, who has been examined here as
</p>
<p>a witness ?
</p>
<p>A. I am.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether your brother made any
</p>
<p>communication to you on the subject of a conversation that he held
</p>
<p>with Dr. Mudd in relation to the assassination of the President,
</p>
<p>before the assassination of, the President ?
</p>
<p>A. The conversation that passed at my house was on Sunday
</p>
<p>morning. He came over to Woodville Church on a Sunday morn-
</p>
<p>ing, and it happened at my house before several gentlemen there.
</p>
<p>Mr. SuUivan Wood was present at the time. We asked him the
</p>
<p>news ; and as he was just from Bryantown the day before, on Sat-
</p>
<p>urday, he was full of news, and was speaking about the arrest of
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd, finding him with the boot, &c. ; and then, during the
</p>
<p>conversation, he observed what Dr. Mudd had told him a few weeks
</p>
<p>previous or several weeks before.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether he had ever mentioned
</p>
<p>that subject to you before Dr. Mudd's arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. He never mentioned the subject to me before that time.
</p>
<p>Q. And that was after the assassination of the President, and
</p>
<p>after Dr. Mudd's arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : after the soldiers were at Bryantown, and the arrest
</p>
<p>of Dr. Mudd. I understood he was arrested at that time : whether
</p>
<p>he was or not, I do not know ; but I heard he was.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Was not that on Easter Sunday, the Sunday after the Presi-
</p>
<p>. dent's assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I disremember.

<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. It was on a Sunday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>252 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. And the boot was mentioned in that conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. He mentioned Dr. Mudd and the boot in that conversation.
</p>
<p>I had not heard any thing of the boot before.
</p>
<p>Q. Then it was the second Sunday after the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard of the conversation before. It was an error
</p>
<p>of my brother as to the day. He was convinced of that.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say that your brother Daniel did not
</p>
<p>mention to you any thing of the conversation with Dr. Mudd rela-
</p>
<p>tive to the assassination before the President was assassinated ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not.
</p>
<p>Q. It was afterwards ?
</p>
<p>A. It was afterwards. That was the only conversation we had
</p>
<p>on the subject, if I remember aright.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you have or have not
</p>
<p>attended your brother professionally at different times ?
</p>
<p>A. I have atttended him in some serious attacks. Some four,
</p>
<p>five, or six years ago, probably six years ago, he had a very serious
</p>
<p>paralytic attack,  partial paralysis of the face, and part of the
</p>
<p>body. He was for some time laboring under considerable nervous
</p>
<p>depression before he recovered. He was mentally affected from it.
</p>
<p>His mind was not exactly right for a long time.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the ^ourt whether your brother's mind is
</p>
<p>now sound at all times ?
</p>
<p>A. I am under the impression that it is not ; not at all times.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not consider that his mind is at all times sound ?
</p>
<p>A, No, sir : I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. When his mind is not in its proper state, will you state to the
</p>
<p>Court whether on those occasions he is or is not credulous, very
</p>
<p>talkative, and unreliable ?
</p>
<p>A. He is credulous and very talkative. He is very apt to tell
</p>
<p>every thing he hears, and believe every thing he hears. I do not
</p>
<p>pretend to say that he would tell things that he did not hear, or
</p>
<p>make up things, or any thing like that ; but he is very talkative,

<p>and very apt to tell every thing he hears.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether, when his mind is not in
</p>
<p>its proper condition, his memory and reason are not both somewhat
</p>
<p>affected ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 253
</p>
<p>A, His reason may be somewhat affected, and his memory also,
</p>
<p>when these attacks of sickness come on. He has some fainting
</p>
<p>spells, and is confined to his bed ; but when he is up, and in the
</p>
<p>enjoyment of good health, he seems to be rational. These attacks
</p>
<p>come on at no particular time. When they do come on, he labors
</p>
<p>under great nervous depression. He has to be stimulated materi-
</p>
<p>ally sometimes. He has not had an attack now for some time : his
</p>
<p>health has been better. :
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you know on what Sunday it was that your
</p>
<p>brother made the statement in regard to Dr. Mudd, and whether it
</p>
<p>was not on Easter Sunday, the Sunday immediately following the
</p>
<p>assassination of President Lincoln.
</p>
<p>A. I expect it was Easter Sunday. It was the Sunday after the
</p>
<p>soldiers were at Bryan town.
</p>
<p>Q. Now state what he said to you on that occasion,  whether
</p>
<p>he did not say to you on that occasion that Dr. Mudd had made a
</p>
<p>certain statement in regard to the President and the Cabinet, and
</p>
<p>the Union men of Maryland, being assassinated within thirty days.
</p>
<p>A. The conversation was this : He was speaking of what Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd had told him ; and he said that Dr. Mudd had said that Lin-
</p>
<p>coln and the whole Cabinet would be killed in a few weeks, and all
</p>
<p>the Union men of Maryland. That was the amount of the conver-
</p>
<p>sation.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was present at that conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Sullivan Wood was present that morning, and I think it
</p>
<p>was Mr. Wood who asked him what was the news. I was engaged
</p>
<p>somewhere in the room at the time, and the conversation arose when
</p>
<p>he came in. That was the first time I heard any thing about it.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. You are certain, that, in the same conversation, he spoke of
</p>
<p>Booth's boot being found in Dr. Mudd's house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Was your brother in his right mind on the day that this con-
</p>
<p>versation took place ?
</p>
<p>VOL. IT. 22
</p>
<p>254 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he seemed to be as rational then as I ever saw
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he much excited ?
</p>
<p>A. No ; not at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think he was capable of telling the truth on that
</p>
<p>day?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. From your knowledge of your brother's character for truth
</p>
<p>and veracity, and also of his mental condition, did you have any
</p>
<p>doubt in your mind of the fact of Dr. Mudd having said to him
</p>
<p>what he represented he had said ?
</p>
<p>A. I had no doubt at the time, though I thought probably he
</p>
<p>might have meant it in a joke.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not asking you what you thought he meant, but
</p>
<p>whether you had any doubt as to the fact of Dr. Mudd having
</p>
<p>said the things your brother represented him to have said to him.
</p>
<p>A. I thought at first that my brother was probably jesting, as he
</p>
<p>was very fond of telling news and so on ; and I observed to him
</p>
<p>at the time, that, if such was not the fact, he ought not to state it
</p>
<p>unless it was true ; and he said it was certainly true, and that Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd had made the statement in Bryantown.
</p>
<p>Q. When he averred that it was true, did you have any further
</p>
<p>doubt about it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I supposed that it was so, as he had heard it. I do
</p>
<p>not suppose that he would swear to any thing that was not so.

<p>A. Since the second day of December last.

<p>Q. Are you a clerk in the establishment ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 255
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness a hotel register.] Is that the re-
</p>
<p>gister of the Pennsylvania House ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether the name of Dr. Samuel
</p>
<p>A. Mudd appears on the register of the hotel at any time during the
</p>
<p>month of January, 1865 ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I examined it in the next room, and the name is
</p>
<p>not on the register.
</p>
<p>Q. You examined that month very carefully ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. \
</p>
<p>Q. And it does not appear ? |,
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the accused, Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, person-
</p>
<p>ally ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I have never seen the gentleman, to my knowledge,
</p>
<p>before. He may have stopped there, and I not know him ; but his
</p>
<p>name certainly would have been on the register if he had stopped
</p>
<p>at the house. We do not allow any person to stop there without
</p>
<p>registering his name.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you turn to that register under the date of Dec. 23,
</p>
<p>1864, and see whether you find his name there?
</p>
<p>A. [Pointing to a page of the register.] There it is : " Samuel
</p>
<p>A. Mudd."
</p>
<p>Q. Do you find that under the date of the 23d of December?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you find also, under that date, another man by the name
</p>
<p>of "Mudd"?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir: "J. T. Mudd." They both occupied the same
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you examined the register after the month of January ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I only examined it for the month of January. You
</p>
<p>requested me to examine it for that month, and I did so. The name
</p>
<p>is not on the book during that month.

<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You say you do not know Dr. Samuel A. Mudd personally?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not personally.
</p>
<p>256 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know him when you see him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I think I would know him from his brother. His
</p>
<p>brother stopped at our place. I never saw him until last evening.
</p>
<p>Q. If you had seen Dr. Samuel A. Mudd at the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>House last winter, you would not know the face now ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I would not have known him.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. What is the rule of the house in regard to guests registering
</p>
<p>their names?
</p>
<p>A. Persons stopping at the hotel are required to register their
</p>
<p>names. Oftentimes persons come in to take a meal, and go in to
</p>
<p>the table, and do not register their names, and pay when they go
</p>
<p>out ; but all persons stopping in the house over night are required
</p>
<p>to register their names.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever known that rule to be departed from in any
</p>
<p>instance ?
</p>
<p>A. Never since I have been there, since the 2d of December.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who slept in that house with Atzerodt the last
</p>
<p>night he was there, the night of the President's assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. No, su' : I was in bed that night.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that man's name registered?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know positively whether it was or not.- The name
</p>
<p>of " Samuel Thomas " was registered : but I was not there ; I was
</p>
<p>in bed. I closed the house at half-past twelve o'clock, and retired.
</p>
<p>Q. The only point to which I wish to direct your attention is, do
</p>
<p>you know who it was that slept with Atzerodt in that house on the
</p>
<p>night of the President's assassination.
</p>
<p>A. I do not ; nothing further than the name that was on the
</p>
<p>book the next morning.
</p>
<p>Q. You understood that somebody slept there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. When I retired, at half-past twelve o'clock, I gave

<p>directions to the porter to allow no persons to come in and go to bed
</p>
<p>unless they registered their names.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 257
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know whether that man registered his name or
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. If it was the rule of the house, why did you order the porter
</p>
<p>on that night to allow no persons to take a room unless they regis-
</p>
<p>tered their names ?
</p>
<p>A. We never allow any persons to take a room, and go to bed,
</p>
<p>unless they register their names.
</p>
<p>Q. You gave him that rule that night?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : at all times.
</p>
<p>Q. I thought you said you gave it to him that night ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it a printed or oral rule day by day ?
</p>
<p>A. It is an oral rule day by day.
</p>
<p>Q. Then strangers do not know any thing about it, except as
</p>
<p>they are told ?
</p>
<p>A. They know very well they cannot get a room unless they
</p>
<p>register their names.
</p>
<p>Q. The amount of your testimony is, that you do not know that
</p>
<p>man, and do not know whether he registered his name or not, as a
</p>
<p>matter of personal knowledge ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And you do not know whether Dr. Samuel A. Mudd was in
</p>
<p>that house in January or not ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; nothing further than the register. That is all I
</p>
<p>know about Dr. Samuel Mudd.
</p>
<p>By the Court : -
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Dr. Mudd might not have been in that
</p>
<p>house under a different name,  an assumed name ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know : I could not tell any thing about that.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you personally acquainted with the person who is regis-
</p>
<p>tered as Mudd ?

<p>A. Yes, sir : registered as " Samuel A. Mudd,"  in Decem-
</p>
<p>ber.
</p>
<p>Q. But your acquaintance with him is not such that you can

<p>undertake to say that he might not have been there under some

<p>other name ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. How long did he remain in December?
</p>
<p>A. I could not tell that ?
</p>
<p>Q. Your register does not show that ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He might have been there until January, for that matter?
</p>
<p>A. The cash-book would show that.
</p>
<p>Q. But this register does not ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>The witness was here requested by Mr. Ewing to retire and
</p>
<p>examine the register produced by him for the name of Dr. Mudd

<p>A. I rode in on the 22d of December. Why I recollect it so
</p>
<p>distinctly is, that I am satisfied of the fact that we got home on
</p>
<p>Christmas Eve, which was the 24th. On the 22d of December,
</p>
<p>I rode to one of my neighbors, who was in the huckstering business,
</p>
<p>and frequently in Washington himself. I wanted to sell him some
</p>
<p>poultry, and get him to do some purchasing of some little articles
</p>
<p>of clothing fiDr me in Washington^ as he was going up. This man's
</p>
<p>name is Montgomery : he is in partnership with a man named Lucas.
</p>
<p>Lucas drives the wagon, and Montgomery occasionally comes up. I
</p>
<p>rode to Dr. Sam. Mudd's to see if he was going up ; and concluded,
</p>
<p>if he was going, I would go also. We came up to Washington
</p>
<p>together on the morning of the 23d of December. We got to
</p>
<p>Washington. We put our horses away, near the Navy Yard ;
</p>
<p>walked up to the avenue. It was a little in the night ; the lamps
</p>
<p>were lit on the street ; I do not know particularly the hour. We
</p>
<p>went to the Pennsylvania House, and registered our names, I think,
</p>
<p>for lodgings. However, we concluded, as we had not been to din-
</p>
<p>ner, we would want something better than an ordinary supper; and
</p>
<p>we concluded to go to a restaurant, and order what we wanted. We
</p>
<p>went to a place on the avenue, that was known, when I lived here
</p>
<p>some years ago, as Walker's Restaurant. I think now it has clianged ;
</p>
<p>and the name, perhaps, is Dubant's. We ordered supper there,
</p>
<p>and remained there possibly an hour. After we left that place, we
</p>
<p>walked into Brown's Hotel merely to see if we could recognize any-

</p>
<p>body from the country. Walked about there some tim^e ; sat there
</p>
<p>a while ; staid a quarter of an hour. We then went to the National
</p>
<p>Hotel. There was a tremendous crowd there, and we got separated.
</p>
<p>I recognized an acquaintance there, who came up and spoke to me ;
</p>
<p>260 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>and, as well as I recollect, Dr. Mudd came to me during that con-
</p>
<p>versation. We separated at the National Hotel. I missed him in
</p>
<p>the crowd. After I got through with my conversation with the
</p>
<p>gentleman who recognized me there, I walked down the avenue, and
</p>
<p>went into several clothing-stores for the purpose of looking at some
</p>
<p>clothing which I intended to purchase the next morning. After a
</p>
<p>while, I walked around to the Pennsylvania House ; and, very soon
</p>
<p>after I got there, Dr. Mudd came in, and we went to bed very shortly
</p>
<p>afterwards. Next morning, after breakfast, we went in company
</p>
<p>together to a man on the avenue, I think by the name of McGrregor,
</p>
<p>a stove-dealer, and purchased a cooking-stove. I felt interested in
</p>
<p>it, because I thought I should want one myself; and therefore I
</p>
<p>went with him. We went through the market-house once or twice
</p>
<p>during the morning. I had some clothing to buy, and he had some
</p>
<p>other little purchases to make, and we separated ; but I saw him
</p>
<p>repeatedly after, every five or ten minutes, until about one o'clock.
</p>
<p>I would either meet him, or go with him in person, every few min-
</p>
<p>utes until that time. We then left the avenue, and went down to
</p>
<p>the Navy Yard, where we had put our horses up ; and finally, about
</p>
<p>three o'clock, we went home. We came together, and we went
</p>
<p>back together.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you sleep in the same room at the Pennsylvania House ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; in the same bed.
</p>
<p>Q. You said that you parted with Dr. Mudd at the National :
</p>
<p>where were you in the Pennsylvania House when you saw him
</p>
<p>again ?
</p>
<p>A. In the Pennsylvania House, there are two rooms : one room
</p>
<p>the office is in, and the register is kept there, and something of a
</p>
<p>bar, perhaps. The rooms are about equal in size. I was sitting
</p>
<p>by the fireplace, very near to the office or counter where the regis-
</p>
<p>ter is on. The first I saw of Dr. Mudd, he came through the
</p>
<p>folding-doors that let one room into the other. I was in conversa-
</p>
<p>tion, and he walked into that room. I was sitting by the fire in

<p>conversation. He came throuo;h those foldino;-doors, out of the first
</p>
<p>room you enter, into the second room. That was the first I saw of
</p>
<p>him there.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any one with him when he came through ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 261
</p>
<p>A. I am certain there was not when he came into the second
</p>
<p>door. I have no knowledge of there being anybody with him. I
</p>
<p>saw no one. There may have been persons : I think it likely there
</p>
<p>were two or three persons sitting in the other room around the
</p>
<p>table ; but, when he walked in there, I saw no one with him.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you were not separated from him the next morning
</p>
<p>for over five or ten minutes at a time ?
</p>
<p>A. I think not. Our business after the purchase of this stove
</p>
<p>was that we had some little things to purchase, and we separated ;
</p>
<p>but I saw him frequently, sometimes opposite on the street. Once,
</p>
<p>I think, he came from the Bank of Washington : he had a little
</p>
<p>business in the bank. I was not in his company all the time, but
</p>
<p>still saw him every ten or fifteen minutes. I met him afterwards,
</p>
<p>and we walked too-etlier throuo-h the market-house two or three
</p>
<p>times.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who took the articles which he bought down to
</p>
<p>his home ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to an inquiry
</p>
<p>about the articles he bought, or who took them. It is of no con-
</p>
<p>sequence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. May it please the Court, it is of a very great deal
</p>
<p>of consequence. The prosecution has attempted to prove by one
</p>
<p>witness a meeting between Booth and Dr. Mudd, and an introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of Booth to Surratt by Dr. Mudd here in Washington. We
</p>
<p>expect to be able to show to the Court conclusively, that, if there
</p>
<p>was any such meeting, it must have been at this visit to the city of
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd, as to which we are now inquiring. In that view, it is
</p>
<p>of very great consequence to the accused to be able to show that
</p>
<p>he came here on business unconnected with Booth, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of rebutting the presumption or inference unfavorable to him which
</p>
<p>might be drawn from the fact of his having met Booth here. That
</p>
<p>alleged meeting with Booth has been put in evidence as part of the
</p>
<p>res gestce of the conspiracy : on any other ground, it would have

</p>
<p>been irrelevant and inadmissible. We have a right to show that
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd came to the city at that time for other purposes ; we
</p>
<p>have a right to show the acts that he did, in order to establish that
</p>
<p>his \dsit was a legitimate business visit to Washington. Therefore
</p>
<p>262 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>it Ls that we ask wlio took the things down ; and we expect to show
</p>
<p>that he arranojed, befoi^e startinoj from home, to have the things which
</p>
<p>he was coming here to purchase hauled down, and that, therefore,
</p>
<p>he came here on legitimate business.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. If the gentleman had
</p>
<p>shown that this man was with Booth on that day, I could see some-
</p>
<p>thhig in his argument ; but, as it is, it does not amount to any thing.
</p>
<p>IMr. Ewixg. But I assure you we expect to follow this up by
</p>
<p>testimony which will conclusively establish that he could not have
</p>
<p>been with Booth upon any other day between that day and the
</p>
<p>assassination of the President.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. They undertake to prove
</p>
<p>by this witness that he could not have been with Booth then : this
</p>
<p>five-minute operation is introduced for that purpose, as I under-
</p>
<p>stand. But now, in order to make out something, for some pur-
</p>
<p>pose I cannot comprehend, they propose to prove that this man
</p>
<p>bought crockery or something that day in town, and got somebody
</p>
<p>to haul it home. That has nothins; in the world to do with this
</p>
<p>case. The amount of it all is, that we have introduced testimony
</p>
<p>here to prove this man's association with Booth in Washington in
</p>
<p>another month at the National Hotel. If they can disprove that,
</p>
<p>well and good ; but it does not tend to disprove it, and does not
</p>
<p>tend to throw any light on the subject, to show, that, in December
</p>
<p>(another time altogether than that stated by our witness for the
</p>
<p>meetino; of Booth and Mudd, which the Court will remember was
</p>
<p>in January, and aboiit the middle of the month), Mudd bought
</p>
<p>certain things, and hired somebody to take them home. All that
</p>
<p>has nothing to do with the case.
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>The question was repeated to the witness, and he answered as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>A. I took a portion of them myself,  a small bundle in a
</p>
<p>buggy that he purchased while I was here. The stove was to have

</p>
<p>been taken down by Mr. Lucas, who was then in market with his
</p>
<p>wagon. I went with Dr. Mudd twice to see Lucas. Lucas's tak-
</p>
<p>ing the stove down depended on whether he could sell all his load
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 263
</p>
<p>of poultry or not : it was a dull market. We went the second
</p>
<p>time, if not the third time, to see whether he had sold out : if he
</p>
<p>sold out his poultry, he could take down the stove ; if not, he would
</p>
<p>not be able to take it that trip. That is about as much as came to
</p>
<p>my knowledge relative to the taking down of the stove.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. xYre you well acc[uainted with Dr. Samuel A. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I am : I have known him from early youth.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his general character, in the neighborhood in
</p>
<p>which he resides, for peace, order, good citizenship ?
</p>
<p>A. Exemplary, I think. I never heard in all my life any thing
</p>
<p>to the contrary. He has always been amiable and estimable, a
</p>
<p>good citizen, a good neighbor, honest, correct. I never heard any
</p>
<p>thing to the contrary.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his character in the neighborhood as a master,
</p>
<p>in the treatment of his servants ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I do.
</p>
<p>Q. State it to the Court.
</p>
<p>A. I have lived very close by him all my lifetime. I think him
</p>
<p>humane, kind, to his servants. I never thought his negroes did a
</p>
<p>great deal of work. I have always regarded him, and he is regard-
</p>
<p>ed universally, I think, as kind and humane to his servants. He
</p>
<p>did not work them very hard, either ; at least, they did not do a
</p>
<p>great deal of work.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know of Booth having been in that country ?
</p>
<p>A. I do : I have seen him myself.
</p>
<p>Q. When and where ? ''
</p>
<p>A. I saw him at church ; that is to say, I saw a stranger there
</p>
<p>whom I did not know. I asked who he was ; and I was told his
</p>
<p>name was Booth, a great tragedian. From the description of him
</p>
<p>since, and from his photograph, I am satisfied it was the same man.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that?
</p>
<p>A. It was in the latter part of November or early in December

</p>
<p>last, I think. I know the weather was pretty chilly,  enough for
</p>
<p>a light overcoat to be worn. I think it was in the middle or latter
</p>
<p>part of November.
</p>
<p>264: THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you kuow on what business Booth was in the country ?
</p>
<p>A. Only from common talk,  what I heard others say.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the common talk ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. The witness need not
</p>
<p>state what the common talk was. It is not competent evidence to
</p>
<p>undertake to prove common talk about a party not on trial here.
</p>
<p>Mr. EwiNG. May it please the Court, I know it is the object of
</p>
<p>the Grovernment to give the accused here liberal opportunities of
</p>
<p>presenting their defence. I am sure the Judge Advocate does not
</p>
<p>intend, by drawing the reins of the rules of evidence tight, to shut
</p>
<p>out testimony which might fairly go to relieve the accused of the
</p>
<p>accusations made against them. I think it is better not only for
</p>
<p>them, but for the Government, whose majesty has been violated,
</p>
<p>and whose law you are about to enforce, that there should be liber-
</p>
<p>ality in allowing these parties to present whatever defence they may
</p>
<p>offer. We wish to show that Booth was in that county ostensibly,
</p>
<p>according to the common understanding of the neighborhood, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of selecting and investing in lands. We introduce
</p>
<p>this as explanatory of his meeting with Dr. Mudd, whose family,
</p>
<p>as we expect to show, were large landholders, and anxious to dispose
</p>
<p>of their lands ; and I trust to the liberality of the Court to allow
</p>
<p>us to prove it.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I wish certainly the utmost liberality in
</p>
<p>the introduction of the testimony of the defence here, and I hope
</p>
<p>the Court will maintain it. If I at any time fall short myself of
</p>
<p>maintaining that spirit, I trust the Court will do it. ' I think, how-
</p>
<p>ever, in this case, there is no principle of evidence that will admit
</p>
<p>the mere talk of a neighborhood. Any fact which any witness knows
</p>
<p>tending to show for what purpose Booth was there, no matter what
</p>
<p>that fact may be, is admissible ; but a mere idle rumor ol which you
</p>
<p>cannot take hold, on which you cannot cross-question, in regard to
</p>
<p>which you cannot speak, it seems to me on no principle by which
</p>
<p>the ascertainment of truth is sought can be received. I wish to

<p>state most distinctly to the Court, that I desire the utmost latitude
</p>
<p>of inquiry indulged in ; and that every thing shall be introduced
</p>
<p>which tends in any manner to illustrate the defence which is made
</p>
<p>for these prisoners. I wish no technical objection, and shall never

<p>THE TRIAL.. 265

<p>make one ; and, if made, I trast it will never be sustained by this
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You speak of the general reputation of the prisoner, Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd. Do you know his reputation for loyalty to the Grovernment
</p>
<p>of the United States during this war ?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know. I have heard him say myself that he
</p>
<p>did not desire to see two governments here. So far as my own
</p>
<p>knowledge goes, I have never heard of any disloyal act of his in
</p>
<p>my life,  never known of any.
</p>
<p>Q. Never heard any disloyal sentiments expressed by him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not that I am aware of. I have heard him express
</p>
<p>sentiments opposed to the policy of the Administration.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you, or not, know that he has been throughout opposed
</p>
<p>to the action of the Government of the United States in its endeav-
</p>
<p>ors to suppress this Rebellion ; has been open and undisguised in
</p>
<p>his opposition to it ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know it. For the last two or three years, our peo-
</p>
<p>ple indeed, myself particularly, have had no disposition to talk
</p>
<p>about the Rebellion or about the war. Going on a long time, I
</p>
<p>very seldom ever talked about it with anybody. Very frequently,
</p>
<p>I would not send to the post-ofl&ce for my papers for a week ; and,
</p>
<p>when I would get them, would not read them ; just look over them
</p>
<p>on Sunday, and nothing more.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you, or not, know that he has constantly held that the
</p>
<p>State of Maryland had been false to her duty in not going with
</p>
<p>other States into the Rebellion against the Government ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard him say so.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not from time to time seen Confederate officers or
</p>
<p>soldiers about his house ?
</p>
<p>A. Never.
</p>
<p>Q. Never have seen them ?

</p>
<p>A. Never.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of his amiability and kind treatment to his ser-
</p>
<p>vants. Have you ever known of his shooting any of them ?

<p>VOL. n. 23
</p>
<p>266 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I heard of that.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any doubt of its truth?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State what you heard about his shooting the slave.
</p>
<p>A. I heard that the servant was obstropulous ; that he had or-
</p>
<p>dered him to do something about the stable, and he refused to do
</p>
<p>it, and stai-ted off to go away. The doctor had his gun with him,
</p>
<p>and he thought he would shoot him and frighten him to make him
</p>
<p>stop and come back. I think I heard him say so myself. He shot
</p>
<p>him somewhere in the calf of the leg, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what the gun was,  whether it was a shot-gun
</p>
<p>or not ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a shot-gun. I do not know whether it was a double-
</p>
<p>barrelled or a single-barrelled gun, but a shot-gun, a bird-gun, I
</p>
<p>think.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any thing of the servant's having attacked
</p>
<p>him?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear that the servant had first attacked him with^a
</p>
<p>curry-comb ?
</p>
<p>A. Really, I do not recollect. I do not think I have heard
</p>
<p>that. I have heard but little about it.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know that servant ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen him ?
</p>
<p>A. I have no doubt I have seen him often ; but I do not know
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know that he is still lame from that wound?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I do not think I have seen him since the occur-
</p>
<p>rence. I think he left the neighborhood some time afterwai-ds.
</p>
<p>If I were to see him now, I think it doubtful whether I should

</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear that his limb was broken by the shot ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I heard it was only a flesh-wound.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. . 207
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. In what part of the leg ?
</p>
<p>A. In some part of the leg ; I do not know whether in the thigh
</p>
<p>or the calf of the leg. It was about the leg.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke, on cross-examination, of your having heard Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd express himself in opposition to the policy of the Adminis-
</p>
<p>tration.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear him express himself with any violence ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have never heard in my life, I think, a violent ex-
</p>
<p>pression from him. I have been in his company a great deal ; and in
</p>
<p>gentlemen's company I do not remember ever hearing an expression
</p>
<p>from him that would not have been admissible in ladies' society.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear him indulge in violent denunciation of
</p>
<p>the GrovernmentV
</p>
<p>A. I never did : it is not his character to do so.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ever talk much in opposition to the Government wi*h
</p>
<p>you?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have never heard him talk a great deal about it ;
</p>
<p>but I have heard him make use of expressions, so that I knew him
</p>
<p>to be opposed to the policy of the Administration  I mean the
</p>
<p>emancipation policy. I have reference only to the emancipation
</p>
<p>policy.
</p>
<p>Q. You have not heard him express himself in opposition to the
</p>
<p>policy of putting down the armed rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I have heard him express himself as being opposed
</p>
<p>to the emancipation policy : as a large slave-owner, himself and his
</p>
<p>father, he did not want to lose his property. I suppose that was
</p>
<p>the objection he had to the emancipation policy of the Government,
</p>
<p> I think, always uncompromising opposition to that.

<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly

<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you live ?
</p>
<p>268 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>A. I live in Charles County, Md., near Bryantown ; two miles
</p>
<p>from Brj^antown.
</p>
<p>Q. In what occupation were you engaged last December?
</p>
<p>A. I am a huckster, and have been for several years.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether there was any arrangement made
</p>
<p>between Dr. 3Iudd and yourself as to carrying some articles from
</p>
<p>the city down home for him last December, and state what time it
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>A. It was on Christmas Eve. Dr. Mudd came to me in market,
</p>
<p>^ and asked me if I would take down a stove for him. I promised to
</p>
<p>do so if I could. He came to me two or three times, and asked
</p>
<p>me not to forget it. I finally told him it was out of my power to
</p>
<p>do it.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. At what time of day did he come to you on Christmas Eve
</p>
<p>to ask you to haul the stove ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect the hour : I suppose, about nine or ten
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>John C. Thompson,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Where are you residing at present ?
</p>
<p>A. In Charles County, Md.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you reside last fall?
</p>
<p>A. In Charles County.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I had a sHght acquaintance with a man of that name.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court how that acquaintance com-
</p>
<p>menced ?
</p>
<p>A. I was introduced to a man styling himself Booth  I do
</p>
<p>not know whether it was Wilkes Booth or not  by Dr. Queen,

<p>my father-in-law. I think it was, as well as I remember, the
</p>
<p> latter part of October last, or some time in November following.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 269
</p>
<p>Q. Was this introcluction given to you by Br. Queen at Dr.
</p>
<p>Queen's house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court how Booth came there.
</p>
<p>A. He came there, as well as I remember, in the evening, I
</p>
<p>think it was about night ; I think it was Saturday night that he
</p>
<p>came there. The precise time I cannot specify, because I did not
</p>
<p>charge my memory with the particular time at which he came ; but
</p>
<p>I think it was on Saturday night, about dusk.
</p>
<p>Q, Had any of the family there known him previously?
</p>
<p>A. None that I know of. I think I can almost say with cer-
</p>
<p>tainty that none of the family ever heard of him before. I know
</p>
<p>that I had never seen or heard of the man before.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court how he got admission there ?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Queen's son Joseph brought him there, I think, from
</p>
<p>Bryantown.
</p>
<p>Q. Where is Dr. Queen now ?
</p>
<p>A. At his place in Charles County.
</p>
<p>Q. State his age and condition.
</p>
<p>A. He is a very old man. He is seventy-four years of age, bed-
</p>
<p>ridden, and very infirm.
</p>
<p>Q. Did this man Booth bring any letters of introduction to Dr.
</p>
<p>Queen? .
</p>
<p>A. I think he brought a letter from somebody in Montreal : if
</p>
<p>I am not mistaken, it was from a man named Martin.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the letter ?
</p>
<p>A. I hurriedly glanced over the letter ; but, not being a letter
</p>
<p>to me, I paid very little attention to it, not being interested.
</p>
<p>Q. State the purport of the letter, as near as you can remember.
</p>
<p>A. As well as I remember, it was simply a letter of introduction
</p>
<p>to Dr. Queen, saying that this man Booth wanted to see the county.
</p>
<p>That is about it, as well as I remember. I do not know what the
</p>
<p>contents of the letter were exactly.

</p>
<p>Q. Were you, or not, present at the first meeting between Dr.
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd, the accused, and this man Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I was at the church.
</p>
<p>Q. State the circumstances.
</p>
<p>33*
</p>
<p>270 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. On Sunday morning, this man Booth, Dr. Queen, and my-
</p>
<p>self went to the church at Bryantown, and I introduced Booth to
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court what was Booth's ostensible object in
</p>
<p>visiting the county.
</p>
<p>A. It was for the purpose of purchasing land : that I am con-
</p>
<p>fident and certain of. I paid very little attention to the man, as,
</p>
<p>apparently, he had no business with me after this letter to Dr.
</p>
<p>Queen. I am confident that it was for the purpose of purchasing
</p>
<p>land ; for he so stated to me : that I distinctly remember. He
</p>
<p>asked me the price of land in that section of the country ; and, as
</p>
<p>well as I remember, it has been some time ago. I told him that
</p>
<p>land varied there in price from $5 to $50 per acre, according to
</p>
<p>the quality of the land, the situation of the land, and the improve-
</p>
<p>ments thereon. Poor land, I thought, was worth only about $5 an
</p>
<p>acre ; good land, with improvements, on a river, I considered worth
</p>
<p>$50 an acre. As far as I could ascertain from him, that was his
</p>
<p>motive, his object, and his ostensible purpose, down there in Charles
</p>
<p>County.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he make any inquiries of you as to who had land for
</p>
<p>sale ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes ; and I think I told him that I was not very well satis-
</p>
<p>fied who in the county had land for sale, but that Mr. Henry Mudd
</p>
<p>was a large land-owner, and that it was possible he might select
</p>
<p>land from him, and he might have land for sale ; but of that fact I
</p>
<p>was not certain, and so stated to him.
</p>
<p>Q. Who is Henry Mudd? What relation is he to the accused?
</p>
<p>A. He is the father of Samuel A. Mudd.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he make any inquiries about the distances from the
</p>
<p>river ?
</p>
<p>A. As well as I remember, he did make inquiries of me about
</p>
<p>the roads in Charles County ; but I was not myself conversant with
</p>
<p>the roads in Charles. The only road that I knew was the road

</p>
<p>from Washington, known as the Stage Road, leading down to Char-
</p>
<p>lotte Hall, and then on down to Leonardtown. I told him that I
</p>
<p>knew the road as far as from Washington to Bryantown. As well
</p>
<p>as 1 remember, he asked me the roads to the Potomac Biver. I
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 271
</p>
<p>told him that I was not conversant with these roads ; that I knew
</p>
<p>as far as Allen's Fresh and Newport, but no faiiher. I never had
</p>
<p>been to the river, and could not give him any satisfaction on that
</p>
<p>score.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth make any inquiries as to the purchase of horses
</p>
<p>in the neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did, as well as I remember. I think he asked
</p>
<p>me if there were any horses in that neighborhood for sale. I told
</p>
<p>him I did not know; that the Government had been purchasing
</p>
<p>horses, and a good many of the neighbors around had been going
</p>
<p>up to Washington to sell their horses. Whether there were any
</p>
<p>here for sale at the time he made the inquiry of me, I was not able
</p>
<p>to state to him.
</p>
<p>Q. When you, Dr. Queen, and Booth went to church, next day,
</p>
<p>was, or was not, your meeting with Dr. Mudd, the accused, casual?
</p>
<p>A. It was simply accidental.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you meet him ?
</p>
<p>A. On Sunday morning, in the churchyard, just in front of the
</p>
<p>church-door, where the male congregation, previous to divine ser-
</p>
<p>vice, are in the habit of assembling ; and I happened to see Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd there with a bevy of gentlemen,  about the first one I think
</p>
<p>I saw ; and I introduced him (Booth) to Dr. Mudd.
</p>
<p>Q. And introduced others, too, to Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so ; but I am not certain. I have no idea what the
</p>
<p>man's business was there, further than that he was apparently a
</p>
<p>purchaser of land. In fact, on the night before, I think, he told
</p>
<p>me that he had made some speculations, or was a shareholder, in
</p>
<p>some oil lands in Pennsylvania, somewhere ; and, as well as I re-
</p>
<p>member, he told me that he had made a good deal of money out of
</p>
<p>those operations, and I did not know but what he came down there
</p>
<p>for the purpose of investing.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Booth stay at Dr. Queen's house during that visit?
</p>
<p>A. I think he staid there that night and the next day, as well

</p>
<p>as I remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see Booth again ?
</p>
<p>A. I think some time, if my memory serves me, in December,
</p>
<p>he came down there a second time to Dr. Queen's house. Bealiy,
</p>
<p>272 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>I did not charge my memory in regard to the man ; but I think it
</p>
<p>was about the middle of the December following after his first visit
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he stay all night on his second visit to Dr. Queen's ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did, and left very early the next morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him in the country but on those two
</p>
<p>visits ?
</p>
<p>A. Never after that.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know of his having been there but on those two
</p>
<p>occasions ?
</p>
<p>A. When he left Dr. Queen's, I did not know whither he went,
</p>
<p>and am not at all conversant with any of his movements thereafter.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. How near do you live to Dr. Samuel A. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it is about seven or eight miles.
</p>
<p>Q. And how near to his father ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it is about something like seven miles.
</p>
<p>Q. How intimately are you acquainted with Dr. Samuel A. Mudd
</p>
<p>and his affairs ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not very intimately acquainted with Dr. Mudd and his
</p>
<p>affairs. I know the doctor personally ; and I must state here that
</p>
<p>I never was more astounded in my life 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. That is not the question.
</p>
<p>I am asking you simply as to facts. You say that, of Dr. Mudd's
</p>
<p>father, Booth was attempting to buy some lands, or spoke of purchas-
</p>
<p>ing some lands ?
</p>
<p>A. He spoke of purchasing lands ; but whether of Dr. Mudd's
</p>
<p>father, or not, I did not state ; but I told Booth, that in all proba-
</p>
<p>bility, as Mr. Henry Mudd, the father of the accused, was an
</p>
<p>extensive landholder, perhaps he might be able to purchase land
</p>
<p>from him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, in that conversation, say any thing to you about
</p>
<p>purchasing lands from Dr. Samuel Mudd ?

</p>
<p>A. No.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know, as a matter of fact, whether Dr. Samuel
</p>
<p>Mudd does own any lands there at all, or not ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 273
</p>
<p>A. I am not positive as to that. Dr. Samuel Mudd lives about
</p>
<p>a mile, or a mile and a half, from his father's ; but whether he lives
</p>
<p>upon land that belongs to his father, or not, I am not able to state
</p>
<p>to this Court.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Who lives nearer to this city, Dr. Queen or Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Really, I cannot answer that question, because I am not very
</p>
<p>well acquainted with the roads in Charles County or Prince George
</p>
<p>County.
</p>
<p>Q. You have not been a resident there all your life ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; only for a short time : but I think Dr. Mudd lives
</p>
<p>the nearer. I would not state that as a positive fact, however.
</p>
<p>Q. Does Dr. Queen live above or below Bryantown,  north or
</p>
<p>south of it?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know the geographical position of the country.
</p>
<p>If I had a map, I might tell.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the signature of that letter of introduction, dated
</p>
<p>Montreal, and directed to Dr. Queen ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember what name was signed to it ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, a man by the name of Martin.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember his first name ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. It might have been John, or James, or William.
</p>
<p>I am not certain as to that.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any Martin resident about Maryland near where
</p>
<p>Dr. Queen lived ? Did you ever know one ?
</p>
<p>A. There is a Martin, who is a lawyer, I think, living in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of Charlotte Hall ; at least, I have so understood. I
</p>
<p>only know him from sight.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not know, and had never heard of the man whose
</p>
<p>name was signed to that letter ?
</p>
<p>A. I knew nothing in the world about him : I never saw him in

</p>
<p>Q. Is it in your knowledge that Booth bought any land in
</p>
<p>Maryland on that letter of introduction, or otherwise ?
</p>
<p>274 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. He never bought any to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>On motion, the Commission adjourned until to-morrow, Saturday,
</p>
<p>May 27, at ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>Saturday, May 27, 1865.
</p>
<p>The Commission again met at the usual hour, and proceeded with
</p>
<p>the examination of witnesses, as follows : 
</p>
<p>George F. Edmunds,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ? -.
</p>
<p>A. I reside at Burlington, Vt.
</p>
<p>Q. What is your profession ?
</p>
<p>A. Counsellor-at-law.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, on the trial that recently occuiTcd in
</p>
<p>Canada of certain offenders known as the St. Alban's raiders, you
</p>
<p>appeared as counsel for the Government of the United States ?
</p>
<p>A. I had charge of the matter for the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether, in the performance of your profes-
</p>
<p>sional duties there, you made the acquaintance of Jacob Thompson,
</p>
<p>William C. Cleary, Clement C. Clay, George N. Sanders, and
</p>
<p>others of that clique ?
</p>
<p>A. In the sense in which that term is ordinarily understood, I
</p>
<p>did not. I know those persons from seeing them every day, and
</p>
<p>having them pointed out to me. I did not have the honor, if it
</p>
<p>may be called such, of being introduced to them,
</p>
<p>Q. Were they in attendance upon the court ?
</p>
<p>A. They were.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they engaged as officers of the Confederate Government
</p>
<p>in defending those raiders?
</p>
<p>A. They assumed to exercise those functions. I, of course, have
</p>
<p>no personal knowledge of their real authority.

</p>
<p>Q. The question I mean to ask is, whether they assumed to be,
</p>
<p>and recoo-nizcd each other as being, in the rebel service?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 275
</p>
<p>A. They did so, all of them. It was notoriously understood, in
</p>
<p>that city, that they were the representatives of that cause.
</p>
<p>Q. Mention the persons whom you met there, and who were so
</p>
<p>recognized.
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I saw Mr. Thompson more than once. I saw
</p>
<p>Mr. C. C. Clay, during the earlier part of the proceedings, almost
</p>
<p>daily, and Mr. Sanders during the whole of the period. Mr.
</p>
<p>Cleary, whom you mention, I saw to know at a later period, when
</p>
<p>he was examined as a witness on the part of the defendants.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he represent, in his testimony on that trial, that those
</p>
<p>persons were engaged in the Confederate service, and that that raid
</p>
<p>was made under the authority of the Confederate Government ?
</p>
<p>A. He so represented, as did all of those persons : they stood
</p>
<p>upon that defence.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness a volume entitled " The St.
</p>
<p>Alban's Raiders, or Investigation into the Charges against Lieuten-
</p>
<p>ant Bennet H. Young and Command, for their Acts at St. Alban's,
</p>
<p>Vt., on the 19th of October, 1864," and represented to have been
</p>
<p>compiled by " L. N. Benjamin, B. C. L.," and printed at ' Mon-
</p>
<p>treal by John Lovell, St. Nicholas Street, 1865."] Look at paper
</p>
<p>B, on page 216, of this book, and state whether or not you have
</p>
<p>seen the original of that document.
</p>
<p>A. I have seen the original of that document.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it, or not, given in evidence on the trial to which you
</p>
<p>referred ?
</p>
<p>A. It was given in evidence at the trial on the part of the
</p>
<p>defendants, Mr. Young and others.
</p>
<p>Q. Given in evidence by them as a genuine document?
</p>
<p>A. It was.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that a correct copy of it?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot swear that it is a compared copy ; but I examined
</p>
<p>the original very critically, and I am able to swear that it is sub-
</p>
<p>stantially a copy, and I have no doubt that it is a literal copy.

<p>Q. Was the " Young " referred to in that commission one of the

<p>A. I do not know that I can answer that question literally. He

<p>produced that document, and professed to be the person named in

</p>
<p>I desire, in the interest of public justice, that he may be examined.
</p>
<p>It will occupy but a moment ; it is as to a single point ; and it is
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 211
</p>
<p>testimony of which I had no knowledge or information at the time
</p>
<p>I made that declaration to the Court the other day. I submit to the
</p>
<p>Court whether, in its discretion, it will, notwithstanding that an-
</p>
<p>nouncement, permit the testimony to be received. I have no doubt
</p>
<p>of the power of the Court. It is a matter of discretion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. The Judge Advocate has not stated to which of the
</p>
<p>prisoners the testimony proposed to be introduced applies.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. No : I did not wish to do that. I wish
</p>
<p>simply to state that the testimony is important.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. The prisoners are represented by different counsel,
</p>
<p>and I think it should be stated to which of them the testimony to
</p>
<p>be introduced applies.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. As the counsel suggests that it is proper
</p>
<p>I should make known to which of the prisoners the testimony
</p>
<p>applies, I have no hesitation in doing so : it is the case of Atzerodt.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster [counsel for the prisoner, George A. Atzerodt]. It
</p>
<p>was understood, I believe, the other day, that the testimony was
</p>
<p>closed for the prosecution as far as any individual prisoners were
</p>
<p>concerned ; at least, I understood so.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. That was the understanding ; but this
</p>
<p>testimony has been since discovered.
</p>
<p>Mr. Poster. I have not opened the defence for him ; and I have
</p>
<p>no objections, therefore.
</p>
<p>The President. No objection being interposed by counsel, the
</p>
<p>witness will be introduced.
</p>
<p>Colonel William R. Nevins,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do vou reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In New York, at present.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you 'state whether or not you were in this city in the
</p>
<p>month of April last ; and if so, on what day ?

</p>
<p>A. I was here on the 12th of April, I think. I recollect the
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 24
</p>
<p>278 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>date from a pass that I obtained from the War Department to go to
</p>
<p>Richmond, bearing date the 12th of April last.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you stop in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. At the Kirk wood House.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you look at the prisoners at the bar, and see whether
</p>
<p>you recognize either of them as the person whom you met in that
</p>
<p>house on that day ?
</p>
<p>A. That man there [pointing to the prisoner, George A. At-
</p>
<p>zerodt]. I think that is the man.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state under what circumstances you met him, and
</p>
<p>what he said to you V
</p>
<p>A. He had on a dark coat, darker than the one he has on ; and,
</p>
<p>as I was coming out, he asked me if I knew where Vice-President
</p>
<p>Johnson, or his room, was. I do not remember which he asked first;
</p>
<p>and I showed him on the left-hand side where the room was, and
</p>
<p>told him that the Vice-President was then at dinner. There was
</p>
<p>no other person excepting the Vice-President in the dining-room at
</p>
<p>the time. I told him the Vice-President was there. I thought he
</p>
<p>was a stranger, and referred him to the Vice-President's servant,
</p>
<p>who was a yellow man, standing behind him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to say that he asked where the room
</p>
<p>of the Vice-President was '?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think that was his first question. I did not
</p>
<p>know the number of his room ; but I knew it was on the left-hand
</p>
<p>side, next to the parlor ; and I told him. " However," said I, " the
</p>
<p>Vice-President is now eating his dinner."
</p>
<p>Q. Did you then part with him, or where did he go ?
</p>
<p>A. I passed on. I was going on to New York for Major Dovi-
</p>
<p>ney, who was to go down with me to Kichmond.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you leave him standing there, or did he go away?
</p>
<p>A. He looked in the dining-room. I do not know whether he
</p>
<p>went in or not.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you pointed out to him the location of the Vice-

<p>President's room ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I said it was the first room on the left-hand side.
</p>
<p>That was his room on that floor. My room was No. 64, on the
</p>
<p>same floor, but the opposite passage.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 279
</p>
<p>Q. Was the room in view from where you pointed it out ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su- : it was on the passage that led into the dining-room ;
</p>
<p>and between that and the space where you go down to the dining-
</p>
<p>room was where this man met me.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. What time of day was this ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was between four and five o'clock. I had been
</p>
<p>delayed at the War Department, and was in a great hurry at the
</p>
<p>time. I was going ojQT on the New- York train to get a gentleman
</p>
<p> Major Deviney  to go down with me to Richmond.
</p>
<p>Q. It was between four and five o'clock ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was. There was no other person at dinner at the
</p>
<p>time but the Vice-President and myself.
</p>
<p>Q. Where, precisely, in the house did this conversation take
</p>
<p>place ?
</p>
<p>A. Right in the hall j in the passage leading into the dining-
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say that he looked into the dining-room.
</p>
<p>A. No : the passage does not look into it ; but there are two or
</p>
<p>three steps (I do not remember which) to go down ; and this man
</p>
<p>met me near the dining-room steps, where you go down.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say he looked into the dining-room ?
</p>
<p>A. I showed him where the Vice-President was. He was sit-
</p>
<p>ting at the far end of the room. I pointed out that that was him
</p>
<p>with his yellow man behind him. The man had on a dark coat,
</p>
<p>and dark clothes at the time ; but that is the man, I am most cer-
</p>
<p>tain [pointing to the prisoner, George A. Atzerodt].
</p>
<p>Q. How long did this conversation take ?
</p>
<p>A. No longer than I told him the words. I do not suppose it
</p>
<p>was over three minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner between to-day and that occa-
</p>
<p>sion ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw him to my knowledge before.

<p>Q. Have you seen him since that time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. You have not seen him since he has been in custody ?
</p>
<p>280 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not been here since. I came in this morn-
</p>
<p>ing in the five-o'clock train. /
</p>
<p>Q. Describe the rest of the dress of the person you saw.
</p>
<p>A. I could not describe the dress exactly, no more than it
</p>
<p>was dark. I was in a hurry, and I thought the gentleman was a
</p>
<p>stranger.
</p>
<p>Q. What sort of a hat did he have on ?
</p>
<p>A. It was a low-crowned hat, a felt hat.
</p>
<p>Q. What color?
</p>
<p>A. Black.
</p>
<p>Q. What sort of pantaloons ?
</p>
<p>A. His clothes all looked dark in the passage. His countenance
</p>
<p>I know ; and that is the same man [pointing to the prisoner, George
</p>
<p>A. Atzerodt]. I did not look at his clothes particularly.
</p>
<p>Q. What marks are there about his person that make you recog-
</p>
<p>nize him as the one ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know any particular marks about him, no more than
</p>
<p>that I could tell him among fifty thousand. I think you would
</p>
<p>have to look at a great many before you would see one exactly the
</p>
<p>same.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you near-sighted ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you be kind enough to state to the Court how old
</p>
<p>you are?
</p>
<p>A. I was born on the 22d day of February, 1803. I guess you
</p>
<p>are a tolerable counter, and can count that.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. I will ask you whether or not, in coming into the presence
</p>
<p>of this man, you did not at once recognize him without his having
</p>
<p>being pointed out to you at all.
</p>
<p>A. Certainly. The colonel (Assistant Judge Advocate Bur-
</p>
<p>nett) asked me ; and I told him it was the same man.

</p>
<p>answer ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : his name has not been mentioned yet that I know of.

<p>Q. And no indication was made to you as to which was the

<p>person ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know his name now.
</p>
<p>Q. And that was on the other side of the room, was it not?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you in this room when your attention was first
</p>
<p>called to this person ?
</p>
<p>A. In the corner near the door.
</p>
<p>Q. Who first called your attention to him ? Colonel Burnett ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. I will ask you whether or not any thing further was said thau
</p>
<p>simply to point out the man whom you saw, if he was here. Were
</p>
<p>not those my words ?
</p>
<p>A. You did not ask any more than whether I knew him, and
</p>
<p>whether I would point out the man ; and I then answered.
</p>
<p>Q. Pointing to this same man ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and then you said to me to go in the next room,
</p>
<p>and you would see me there. That was all the conversation.
</p>
<p>Q. You have no doubt about that being the person ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, no, sir !

<p>A. It was not more than three or four minutes ; and then the
</p>
<p>doctor came to the door. Mrs. Mudd had started off a little girl
</p>
<p>for a woman to come and clean the house, as the gentleman had
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 285
</p>
<p>gone ; and then Dr. IMucld came in, and asked if they had not
</p>
<p>gone for the woman to clean up the house.

<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the card-photograph of J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, marked Exhibit No. 1.] Look at that picture, and see if

<p>you ever saw that man at Dr. Mudd's.
</p>
<p>A. If I ever saw him, I cannot recollect him.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not recollect of ever seeing him ?
</p>
<p>A. No, indeed : I never saw anybody like that picture that I
</p>
<p>can recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say, that, when the doctor went to Gies-
</p>
<p>boro,' he went away one day and came back the next, and was away
</p>
<p>one night?
</p>
<p>A. Just one night, to the best of my recollection.
</p>
<p>Q. And when he went to Washington, he left home one day and
</p>
<p>came back the next, and was away one night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, to the best of my recollection.

<p>said, do you ?

</p>
<p>there or not. I know he went since I have been there.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it after you came there that he went away the
</p>
<p>next time ? Was it two weeks after ?
</p>
<p>A. Two or three weeks after, as near as I recoUect. I cannot
</p>
<p>recollect exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. And that second time he was away all night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long after you came there was the third time he went
</p>
<p>away when he was away all night ?
</p>
<p>A. I think there was about 'a week or two weeks between the
</p>
<p>time he went to Griesboro' and the next time he went away ; but I
</p>
<p>cannot come at it exactly.
</p>
<p>By the Coukt :
</p>
<p>Q. When he went to Griesboro', did he buy any horses?
</p>
<p>A. He said he missed the day, and could not buy any.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know any thing about whether anybody went
</p>
<p>with him there, except ft'om what he said, or his wife said, do you ?
</p>
<p>A. JMr. Henry Mudd, his brother, was there to go with him one
</p>
<p>day.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Henry Mudd start fi-om the house with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Samuel A. Mudd?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 287
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have seen it often and frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the register of the Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>House, heretofore produced.] State whether you see his hand-
</p>
<p>writing there.
</p>
<p>A. I do. It is on the page, open before me.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the date of the entry?
</p>
<p>A. Friday, Dec. 23, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the book ?
</p>
<p>A. The Pennsylvania-House hotel-register. I am very familiar
</p>
<p>with this register. I have registered my name repeatedly in this
</p>
<p>book at that hotel in times past. That is his handwriting. I regis-
</p>
<p>tered my own name two names above his. We went in together.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know in what hotel in Washington Dr. Samuel A.
</p>
<p>Mudd was in the habit of stopping ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I do not. He had some relatives in Washington,
</p>
<p>and I frequently heard him speak of stopping at night with his
</p>
<p>relatives. This is the only time I ever recollect being with him in
</p>
<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Daniel J. Thomas, who has been
</p>
<p>a witness for the prosecution in this case ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I am acquainted with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know his reputation, in the neighborhood in which
</p>
<p>he lives, for truth and veracity ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I do know his reputation.
</p>
<p>Q. State what it is.
</p>
<p>A. It is bad.
</p>
<p>Q. From your knowledge of his reputation for truth and ve-
</p>
<p>racity, would you believe him under oath ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I could.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. When you state that you know his reputation, what do you
</p>
<p>mean by that ?
</p>
<p>A. I mean that he is riding about the country, telHng a great

</p>
<p>many things marvellous and miraculous.
</p>
<p>Q. You mean that by his general reputation ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>288 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you base the opinion as to his general reputation being
</p>
<p>bad on the fact of his riding about the country, telling marvellous
</p>
<p>stories ?
</p>
<p>A. Not entirely, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. On what did you base that opinion ?
</p>
<p>A. From my personal acquaintance with and knowledge of him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you base it on your personal acquaintance with and
</p>
<p>knowledofe of him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, and what is generally spoken of him by others.
</p>
<p>Q. What do you say has been generally spoken of him by oth-
</p>
<p>ers in regard to his reputation for truth ?
</p>
<p>A. I say that it is pretty bad.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that what is generally spoken of him by his neighbors
</p>
<p>where he lives ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, so far as has come under my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. How many persons did you ever hear speak of his general
</p>
<p>reputation for truth before this trial here, and his testimony the
</p>
<p>other day ?
</p>
<p>A. I assure you that it has not been since this occurrence that
</p>
<p>I have formed this opinion, by any means.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did you hear speak of his general reputation for truth
</p>
<p>before ?
</p>
<p>A. I hardly know how I can illustrate that, unless I state one or
</p>
<p>two little circumstances.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not asking for circumstances, but I am asking who you
</p>
<p>heard speak of his general reputation for truth.
</p>
<p>A. I have heard several,  many.
</p>
<p>Q. You say many ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. How many did you hear speak of it ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I could state now.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear ten ?
</p>
<p>A. I think perhaps I have heard ten.

</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure of that ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. I am pretty certain that I have heard as many
</p>
<p>as ten speak of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you name the ten ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 289
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know. I am speaking now from wliat I hear
</p>
<p>generally.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you name half of the ten?
</p>
<p>A. I think I can.
</p>
<p>Q. Who are they?
</p>
<p>A. I think I might say, .with a great deal of propriety, that I
</p>
<p>might name a dozen whom I heard make that remark.
</p>
<p>Q. Who are they ?
</p>
<p>A. I will name Dr. George Mudd for one : I think I can name
</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you hear Dr. George Mudd speak about it?
</p>
<p>A. I think I have heard him speak about it as early as two
</p>
<p>years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say of Thomas's general character for truth ?
</p>
<p>A. Just what I have said here about it, pretty much.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say of Thomas's general character for truth?
</p>
<p>A. That it was bad ; that he did not think his character for
</p>
<p>truth was good ; that it was bad.
</p>
<p>Q. How did he come to say that?
</p>
<p>A. It was in connection with some matter that grew out of the
</p>
<p>cu'cumstances of Colonel Birney's being down there. I mentioned
</p>
<p>that because it was about that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Colonel Birney in the Union service ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. It was about the time Colonel Bu'ney was sta-
</p>
<p>tioned at Benedict, I think, that I heard this remark, to the best of
</p>
<p>my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not understand that Thomas was opposed to Colonel
</p>
<p>Birney and his Union force ?
</p>
<p>A. Not at all. I merely mentioned that as about the time. It
</p>
<p>grew out of a circumstance that occurred then. I heard many
</p>
<p>speak of it.
</p>
<p>Q. What was it about ?
</p>
<p>A. About his having a man arrested there.

</p>
<p>Q. Arrested for what? For treason?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know what it was for that he was airested, and car-
</p>
<p>ried up to Colonel Bkney's ; and it was reported, and generally
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 25
</p>
<p>290 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>stated, that it was on the testimony of Thomas ; and he was released,
</p>
<p>and sent home the next day. 
</p>
<p>Q. And, because he was not held and kept, they concluded that
</p>
<p>Thomas was not entitled to belief?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that that was the conclusion.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know that the fact about it was that Thomas had
</p>
<p>had a man arrested for some sort of disloyalty ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not know that.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was the man that he had arrested?
</p>
<p>A. His name was Bean, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not spoken of by Dr. Greorge Mudd that he had been
</p>
<p>arrested for some sort of disloyalty ?
</p>
<p>A. Possibly it was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not hear at the time that this man Thomas had been
</p>
<p>guilty of the great offence, in George Mudd's eyes, of having had
</p>
<p>a man arrested for disloyalty ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not at all. Dr. George Mudd is as strong a Union
</p>
<p>man as there is in the United States.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he not postmaster down there?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether it was in connection with the delivery
</p>
<p>of rebel mails that this complaint was made by Thomas ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what it was about ?
</p>
<p>A. It was that Bean had a brother in the rebel army, I think,
</p>
<p>and that his brother had been home. This one  lives with his
</p>
<p>mother.
</p>
<p>Q. He had entertained rebel soldiers,  that was the ground of
</p>
<p>the complaint?
</p>
<p>A. I believe, something like that.
</p>
<p>Q. And thereupon he was condemned by Dr. George Mudd for
</p>
<p>doing that ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>Q. He did not condemn him for doing it ? "
</p>
<p>A. Not a bit of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not in connection with that that he said he was not
</p>
<p>entitled to belief?
</p>
<p>TUE TRIAL. 291
</p>
<p>A. It was about that time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not about that ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I heard him make this remark.
</p>
<p>Q. I understood you to say it was about that thing ?
</p>
<p>A. It was about that time ; and possibly it grew out of this
</p>
<p>thing.
</p>
<p>Q, Is that the only person you heard assail this man's character
</p>
<p>for truth ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I have heard many others.
</p>
<p>Q. Who are the others ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I can name now any particular one. I
</p>
<p>thought but little about it, cared but little about it, and gave but
</p>
<p>little attention to it.
</p>
<p>Q. If you can name but two men who ever assailed his character
</p>
<p>for truth, how came you to the conclusion that it was a general
</p>
<p>report in his neighborhood that he was not entitled to belief?
</p>
<p>A. I heard it from different persons.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know you heard it from different persons, when
</p>
<p>you cannot name two ?
</p>
<p>A. This has been some time since.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What relation are you to Dr. Samuel A. Mudd?
</p>
<p>A. My father and his father were first cousins.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you live in his neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. And have lived there for what length of time ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been living there since 1850.
</p>
<p>Q. And been intimate with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Moderately so. We meet frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. The intercourse of families related has existed between you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.

</p>
<p>A. Frequently.
</p>
<p>292 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not 3Ir. Daniel J. Thomas has
</p>
<p>not frequently been a witness in courts ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect of his having been a witness at any particu-
</p>
<p>lar time when I was in court and on juries. I have no recollection
</p>
<p>at this moment of that.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say, from the best of your recollection,
</p>
<p>that his general reputation in his neighborhood for truth and veracity
</p>
<p>is bad ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You have stated, in answer to a question, that you have not
</p>
<p>heard Thomas testify in courts : have you heard anybody under-
</p>
<p>take the responsibihty of saying that he had ever sworn falsely in
</p>
<p>courts either ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you not aware of the fact, that he has been very active
</p>
<p>in supporting the Grovernment down there, and acting in the
</p>
<p>capacity of an official for the Government since the breaking-out of
</p>
<p>this Bebelhon ?
</p>
<p>A. He says so himself,
</p>
<p>Q. You are aware of the fact that he is so reputed to be ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. You are aware of another fact,  that a very considerable por-
</p>
<p>tion of the people in that neighborhood have been reputed some-
</p>
<p>what disloyal, and a good deal favorable to the Rebellion, are you
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. I am aware that several young men from our section have
</p>
<p>gone to the rebel army.
</p>
<p>Q. And a good many in that county, who remained behind,
</p>
<p>have been makins; a n-ood deal of clamor afminst the Government,
</p>
<p>and in favor of the Rebellion, have they not ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to much extent.
</p>
<p>Q. Is not that a general report, too, along with the rest ?

<p>THE TRIAL. 293
</p>
<p>reputation of being favorable to tlie Rebellion, and against the
</p>
<p>Government ?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know that that is not the fact ?
</p>
<p>A. I really do not know now. I did not know what were the
</p>
<p>sentiments of many whom I heard speak of this.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know another fact,  that those who were strong
</p>
<p>and vigorous supporters of the Government were also the subject
</p>
<p>of defamation generally through that neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not know that.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know any thing of rebels being fed and supported
</p>
<p>there in concealment by inhabitants in that neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not heard of such things by general report?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I ever did.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not stated yourself, in town here, that you had
</p>
<p>heard such thin2;s ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not that I am aware of. I have no knowledge of
</p>
<p>ever havinor so stated.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not so state yesterday in the other room, to Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant Cottingham, that rebels had been supported and concealed
</p>
<p>in that very neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. I have no knowledge in the world of having made such a
</p>
<p>remark. I certainly think I did not make any such remark.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you never hear of rebels lurking about there ?
</p>
<p>A. In Bryantown, about four or five miles from ray house, when
</p>
<p>I have ridden there on business, I have seen men passing and re-
</p>
<p>passing, who, I was told, were in the rebel service. I have no
</p>
<p>knowledge of their having been in my neighborhood and fed there,
</p>
<p>and do not know any thing about it.

<p>the slightest sympathy with the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>Q. What was his reputation for loyalty ?
</p>
<p>A. I think there would be very little difficulty in establishing
</p>
<p>that fact outside of myself. It is very good, I think. He is so
</p>
<p>regarded universally.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear Dr. George Mudd say any thing against

<p>the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. Very often.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear him say any thing against the admin-
</p>
<p>istration of the Government in prosecuting the war against the

<p>Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. Not a word, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. He made no complaints about it ?
</p>
<p>A. Not a word, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Daniel J. Thomas hold any position under the

<p>Government ?
</p>
<p>A. He says himself that he is a detective.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know it from any other source except himself?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether such is the fact or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that it is the fact.
</p>
<p>Q. All you know is that he claimed to be a detective ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know under whose orders he claimed to be acting ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, under Colonel Holland.

<p>recalled for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State your full name.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 295
</p>
<p>A. Bennett F. Gwynn.
</p>
<p>Q. Commonly called Ben. Gwynn ?
</p>
<p>A. Sometimes I am called Ben. Gwynn.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether, during last summer, in company with
</p>
<p>Captain White from Tennessee, Captain Perry, Lieutenant Perry,
</p>
<p>Andrew Gwynn, and George Gwynn or either of them, you were
</p>
<p>about Dr. Samuel A. Mudd's house for several days ?
</p>
<p>A. I was not. I do not know any of the parties named ; and I
</p>
<p>never heard of them, except Andrew Gwynn and George Gwynn.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you with your brothers, Andrew Gwynn and George
</p>
<p>Gwynn, about Dr. Mudd's house last year ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. For any time?
</p>
<p>A. I have not been in Dr. Mudd's house since about the 1st of
</p>
<p>November, 1861. I have not been on his place, or nearer his
</p>
<p>place than church, since about the 6th of November, 1861.
</p>
<p>Q. State what occurred in 1861, when you were in the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood of Dr. Mudd's house.
</p>
<p>A. I was there with my brother, Andrew J. Gwynn, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Jerry Dyer. About that time, General Sickles came over into
</p>
<p>Maryland, arresting almost everybody. I was threatened with
</p>
<p>arrest ; told I was to be arrested ; and I went out of the neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood a while to avoid it. I went down into Charles County ; staid
</p>
<p>about among friends there for a week or so, as almost everybody
</p>
<p>else was doing. There was a good deal of running about that
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>Q. Go on, and tell all about it.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question.
</p>
<p>What occurred in 1861 was not in issue.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing said the prosecution had called four or five witnesses
</p>
<p>to prove that several persons, among whom was the witness now on
</p>
<p>the stand, had been concealed in the neighborhood of Dr. Mudd's
</p>
<p>house for a week, and that their meals were brought to them by

<p>him or his servants ; and had attempted to show that those persons
</p>
<p>were in the Confederate service, and that Dr. Mudd was guilty of
</p>
<p>treason in assisting them to secrete themselves ; and had stated that

</p>
<p>tliat occurrence took place last year or the yeai' before. To prove by
</p>
<p>this witness and otliei's that no such thing occurred last year or the
</p>
<p>year before might not be regarded as a complete answer to the alle-
</p>
<p>gation ; and hence it was proposed now to show that the transaction
</p>
<p>referred to took place in 1861, at the beginning of the war, at a
</p>
<p>time of general teiTor in the community, and that some of the per-
</p>
<p>sons alleged to have been concealed there were not there. To
</p>
<p>withhold from the accused the right to prove this would be denying
</p>
<p>to him a most leo^itimate line of defence.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham repUed that the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment had introduced no testimony in regard to any such transac-
</p>
<p>tion in 1861, and hence the testunony now proposed to be intro-
</p>
<p>duced was irrelevant and immaterial. If the witness should swear
</p>
<p>falsely as to that, it would not be legal perjury, because it was a
</p>
<p>matter not in issue. The witness could be inquired of as to the
</p>
<p>time when it was stated be had been there, but not as to what
</p>
<p>occurred in 1861.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mk. Ewing.] Where did you, and the party who were
</p>
<p>with you near Dr. Mudd's, sleep ?
</p>
<p>A. We slept in the pines near the spring.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you sleep on ?
</p>
<p>A. We had some counterpanes.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were they furnished from ?
</p>
<p>A. From Dr. Mudd's.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you get your meals ?
</p>
<p>A. I think Dr. Mudd brought them.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you there ?
</p>
<p>A. Four or five days.
</p>
<p>Q. State the circumstances of your being there, and what oc-
</p>
<p>curred when you were there.
</p>
<p>A. As I said before, I left my neighborhood and went down
</p>
<p>there, and staid around in the neighborhood,  part of the time at his

<p>place, and part of the time elsewhere. He fed us there, gave us
</p>
<p>something to eat, and had some bed-clothing brought out of the
</p>
<p>house. That was all.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 297
</p>
<p>Q. Were you and tlic party with you in the liouse while there ?
</p>
<p>A. Part of the time, we were at the house.
</p>
<p>Q. Frequently?
</p>
<p>A. Almost every day, I think, for a while.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were your horses kept ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Who attended to them ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it a servant of Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I suppose so.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where John H. Surratt was at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he was at St. Charles College then.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether tiiere were any charges against the
</p>
<p>party that were there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I came up to Washington from the 5th to the
</p>
<p>10th of November to give myself up. I was tired of being away.
</p>
<p>I came up here, and I think they said there were no charges against
</p>
<p>me, or something of that sort ; and I took the oath, and went home.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you learn whether or not there were or had been any
</p>
<p>charges against you ?
</p>
<p>A. I think they said there were none filed there.
</p>
<p>Q. What induced the party to sleep in the pines ?
</p>
<p>A. I did it to avoid an arrest.
</p>
<p>Q. What reason had you for supposing that you were to be
</p>
<p>arrested ?
</p>
<p>A. Almost everybody was being arrested down there, and I
</p>
<p>thought I should be too. It was understood that I was to be
</p>
<p>arrested, and I went down there.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen Surratt in Charles County since ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not. I have seen him in Prince George's County.
</p>
<p>I will state here that it was not in November I slept in the pines.
</p>
<p>It was in August, 1861, we slept in the pines ; and it was Novem-
</p>
<p>ber I came to Washington.

</p>
<p>Q. How long was your party about the house then ?
</p>
<p>A, Four or five days. That was the tune I spoke of being in
</p>
<p>the woods there. It was in the latter part of August, or the first
</p>
<p>of September.

<p>298 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of Andrew J. Gwynn being with your there.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state where he has been since?
</p>
<p>A. He has been South ever since, I have understood.
</p>
<p>Q. What relation is he to you ?
</p>
<p>A. A brother.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was his home before he went South?
</p>
<p>A. Prince George's County.
</p>
<p>Q. \\niere your home is ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : seven or eight miles off.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been living in Prince George's County ever since ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Andrew J. Gwynn has been in that
</p>
<p>county, in Charles or Prince George's County, since 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever heard of his being there?
</p>
<p>A. I heard that he was over at one time ; but I do not know it :
</p>
<p>I did not see him.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time was that ?
</p>
<p>A. Some time during last winter, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you never heard of his being there since or before,
</p>
<p>after he went South ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in 1861 did he go South?
</p>
<p>A. In August.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know Albion Brooke ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. I think he is a nephew of Jerry Dyer.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not he was at Dr. Mudd's house during
</p>
<p>that time.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : several times I saw him there.

<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You say that all the matters to which you depose occurred
</p>
<p>inthef-dlofl861?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 299
</p>
<p>A. In the latter part of August or the first part of September,
</p>
<p>1861.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of the universality of these arrests : was it not
</p>
<p>understood that they were confined to persons who were suspected
</p>
<p>of disloyal practices ?
</p>
<p>A. It was generally members of volunteer companies down there
</p>
<p>that were arrested.
</p>
<p>Q, What kind of companies ? Were they organized for the de-
</p>
<p>fence of the United States ?
</p>
<p>A. They were commissioned by Grovemor Hicks, of the State of
</p>
<p>Maryland.
</p>
<p>Q. Upon what ground did you suppose you would be arrested ?
</p>
<p>A. I was captain of a cavalry company down there.
</p>
<p>Q. Organized for what purpose ?
</p>
<p>A. It was called the homo guard for the purpose of protection
</p>
<p>to the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>Q. Against whom ?
</p>
<p>A. At that time there was a good deal of dissatisfaction amongst
</p>
<p>the blacks, and the persons of the neighborhood thought it would
</p>
<p>be a good plan to organize a company. Companies were organiz-
</p>
<p>ing all through the counties. I petitioned Grovernor Hicks, and he
</p>
<p>gave me a commission.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not understood that these were State organizations,
</p>
<p>and intended to stand by the State in any disloyal position it might
</p>
<p>take against the Grovernment ?
</p>
<p>A. That was my impression of them.
</p>
<p>Q. And you were a captain of one of those companies ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You felt, therefore, that it was likely you would be ar-
</p>
<p>rested ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I did from that. Some of the members
</p>
<p>of my company were arrested, and I understood there was an order
</p>
<p>for my arrest ; and I left.

</p>
<p>Q. You slept there in the pines for the sole purpose of escaping
</p>
<p>that arrest?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir,
</p>
<p>Q. Dr. Mudd, I suppose, fully concurred in your sentiments.
</p>
<p>300 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>and in the sentiment which pervaded the local military organiza-
</p>
<p>tion of which you speak ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I hardly recollect what his sentiments were
</p>
<p>at the time, except politically.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he know very well why you were hiding in the pines,
</p>
<p>and why he was feeding you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : he knew that.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. When was the company of which you were captain organ-
</p>
<p>ized ?
</p>
<p>A. I think, in the fall or winter of 1860.
</p>
<p>Q. In what county was that company organized ?
</p>
<p>A. Prince George's.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it in the winter of 1859-60, or 1860-61 ?
</p>
<p>A. It was organized, I think, in 1860, the fall or winter of 1860.
</p>
<p>Before the end of 1860 it was organized.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it organized before or after the election of Mr. Lincoln ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I think we commenced getting it up before
</p>
<p>that time ; bmt I do not know that it was fully organized until after
</p>
<p>that time.
</p>
<p>Q. How far was the company organized from Dr. Mudd's place ?
</p>
<p>A. About eifirht or ten miles.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Dr. Mudd was a member of any of
</p>
<p>the volunteer companies ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he was.
</p>
<p>Q. What company ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know the name of it. It was a company gotten
</p>
<p>up in Bryantown, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was the captain of it ?
</p>
<p>A. That I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you sure that he was a member of a company ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he was. I do not know it to my knowledge for a
</p>
<p>fact.

<p>Jeremiah Dyer,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 301
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you live ?
</p>
<p>A. I live in Baltimore at this time.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you reside last before you went to Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. In Charles County, Md., the Fourth Election District.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Samuel A. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q. State how far you lived from his house.
</p>
<p>A. The riding way, about half a mile ; but, around the main
</p>
<p>road, I suppose it was about four miles,
</p>
<p>Q. When did you leave your residence in Charles County ?
</p>
<p>A. I entered into business in Baltimore this May two years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. How long had you lived at your place in Charles County
</p>
<p>before going to Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. I was raised there. I was born about a mile and a half
</p>
<p>from there, and I went to that house when I was a child.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you know Sylvester Eglen, who has been a
</p>
<p>witness for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he a servant of the father of the accused ?
</p>
<p>A- Yes, sir ; Mr. Mudd's carriage-driver.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know Sylvester's brother Frank ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know Dick Gardiner and Lou Gardiner?
</p>
<p>A. I know Dick ; but I do not know any one by the name of
</p>
<p>Lou Gardiner. There were several by the name of Dick : I do not
</p>
<p>know what Dick you are alluding to.
</p>
<p>Q. Dick, the servant of Dr. Mudd.
</p>
<p>A. I think he called himself Dick Washington. I knew him
</p>
<p>very well : he was raised on the place where I was. Luke Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, of the same family, was a boy that belonged to me.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether in August, 1863, at the house of the accused,

<p>versation with Walter Bowie and the accused, the accused said that
</p>
<p>he would send Sylvester Eglen and his brother Frank, and any
</p>
<p>others of his servants, to Richmond.
</p>
<p>A. I never had such a conversation with him. I never heard a
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 26
</p>
<p>302 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>conversation with him by Dr. Mudd on that subject in my life. In
</p>
<p>August, 1863, I was not in the county. I went to Baltimore from
</p>
<p>the county on the 1st day of August, and remained there until
</p>
<p>about October. I then heard some of my hands had left the farm,
</p>
<p>and I went down to secure my crop. Several had left, leaving me
</p>
<p>short of hands ; and I had to hu'e hands to get in the rest of my
</p>
<p>crop.
</p>
<p>Q. The time you heard of the hands going away was the time
</p>
<p>when a large party of them left that neighborhood, was it not ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : some thirty or forty left.
</p>
<p>Q. You never after that, or at any time, heard Dr. Mudd speak
</p>
<p>of sending: those servants to Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear him speak of sending any of his servants
</p>
<p>to Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. Never. I heard, when I got down in the country, that there
</p>
<p>had been such a report started there by a man named Turner, stat-
</p>
<p>in  he was o-oino; to catch up all the neo'roes in the nei^jhborhood,
</p>
<p>and send them away. So far as my entertaining such an opinion is
</p>
<p>concerned, or Dr. Mudd's saying such a thing, I never heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever meet Dr. Mudd in company with Walter
</p>
<p>Bowie ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware of.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you say that you never met Dr. Mudd in company with
</p>
<p>"Walter Bowie at the house of Dr. Mudd's father ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I ever did : I am satisfied I never did. I
</p>
<p>recollect that about two years ago  I think in the fall of 1862 or
</p>
<p>spring of 1863  I was standing in Mr. Mudd's yard, and some
</p>
<p>one rode in the lot. I was talking then with Dr. Mudd, the old
</p>
<p>man, in front of his porch ; and he turned to me, and said, " I won-
</p>
<p>der who is coming in." I turned, and said, " I believe it is Wat
</p>
<p>Bowie." Then he said, " I wonder what that fellow wants here ; "
</p>
<p>turned his back, and went into the house. Bowie came in a side

</p>
<p>gentlemen a little while, and then went away. I do not know
</p>
<p>whether Dr. Mudd was there or not ; but my impression is that he
</p>
<p>was not.

</p>
<p>Q. DiJ you know Andrew Gwynn ?
</p>
<p>A. Very well.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where he has been since 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. He has been in the rebel army.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever seen him since 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you meet him and Surratt and Dr. Blanford at the
</p>
<p>house of Dr. Mudd's father ?
</p>
<p>A. Never. I never saw Surratt there. I have seen him ; but
</p>
<p>never at IMr. Mudd's place, or anywhere in the neighborhood. The
</p>
<p>only time I ever saw him in that vicinity was when I met him com-
</p>
<p>ing from Bryantown ; he was going towards home, and I rode up
</p>
<p>the road with him.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that ?
</p>
<p>A. Some two or three years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether or not any of Surratt's family were
</p>
<p>at Bryantown then ?
</p>
<p>A. He had a sister at school there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you last year see Surratt drive up to the house of Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's father, and take his horse out of a buggy V
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Milo Simms, who has been a wit-
</p>
<p>ness in this case ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : I know Milo, the boy that used to live at Dr. Mudd's.
</p>
<p>Q, Rachel Spencer?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Melvina Washington ?

</p>
<p>A. I think they were. I do not know positively ; but, to the

<p>best of my recollection, all of them were. I know I bought the

</p>
<p>woman Melvina for Dr. Mudd in 1859, 1860, or 1861, or about
</p>
<p>that time,  just before tlie war.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at Dr. Mudd's house, or in the neighborhood, with
</p>
<p>Ben. Gwynn, in the summer or fall of 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. I was, in September, 1861,  about the first of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you about the house then ?
</p>
<p>A. We were in that neighborhood about a week, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. What were you doing ?
</p>
<p>A. We were knocking about in the pines, and around there. It
</p>
<p>was about the time Colonel D wight's regiment was passing thi'ough ;
</p>
<p>and there was a perfect panic in the neighborhood : the report was,
</p>
<p>that everybody was to be arrested. They were arresting a great
</p>
<p>many. Mr. Gwj^nn and his brother came down in a fright, stating
</p>
<p>that they had been to the house to arrest them, or had been informed
</p>
<p>they were on the way there. I also received notice that I was to
</p>
<p>be arrested. The two Gwynns came down then, and I met them
</p>
<p>there at Dr. Mudd's, or my house, I do not know which : the farms
</p>
<p>are adjoining. For several nights, we slept in the pines between his
</p>
<p>house and mine. That situation was a little inconvenient ; and we
</p>
<p>moved over, and lay, I think, one or two nights near his spring. We
</p>
<p>had some bed-clothing there.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you get the bed-clothing from?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd's house and mine : I think, most of it from Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd's.
</p>
<p>Q. "WTiere did you get your meals ?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd brought them to us when we were near his house.
</p>
<p>There is a large swamp between his house and mine. The first
</p>
<p>night, we were on the other side of the swamp. After that, we
</p>
<p>came over nearer his house, within a hundred and fifty or two
</p>
<p>hundred yards of his house ; and he brought down our meals to us.
</p>
<p>I think the girl Mary brought down a pot of coffee in the morning.

<p>A. Mary Eglen, I think ; the girl that used to be about the house
</p>
<p>there. The doctor used to biing down a basket with some meat
</p>
<p>and bread, biscuit, ham, &c. ; and she brought a pot of coffee.
</p>
<p>Q. Vv''as she a colored giil ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 305
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; Mary Eglen, or Mary Simms,  the only servant
</p>
<p>he had by the name of Mary.
</p>
<p>Q. Who took care of the horses of the party?
</p>
<p>A. I think Mr. Gwynn's horses were left at Dr. Mudd's stable.
</p>
<p>Q. Who took care of them there ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose they were fed by the boys there.
</p>
<p>Q. Wliatboys?
</p>
<p>A. The boy Milo, who was generally about the house and stable,
</p>
<p>and who used to bring the doctor's horses out, and put them back :
</p>
<p>sometimes the other boy  the yellow boy  would do it.
</p>
<p>Q. State how the party was dressed.
</p>
<p>A. They had on citizens' clothes.
</p>
<p>Q. Who comprised the party ?
</p>
<p>A. Ben. Grwynn, Andrew Gwynn, and myself.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you recollect whether the apples and pears were ripe
</p>
<p>about that time ?
</p>
<p>A. It was about that season. September is our fruit season in
</p>
<p>that part of the country.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether any watch was kept at that time
</p>
<p>at Dr. Mudd's house ?
</p>
<p>A. I recollect my telling the children there to keep a lookout,
</p>
<p>and, if any one came, to let me know.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Albion Brooke was about the house
</p>
<p>of Dr. Mudd durins; that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I think not. I believe he was over at my place. He may
</p>
<p>have gone across to Dr. Mudd's : he very often went across there.
</p>
<p>I know he came to where we were.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any thing of WilHam Mudd, Vincent Mudd,
</p>
<p>and Albert Mudd, or either of them, about that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect. Very likely we did. They were very
</p>
<p>close by. I think Mr. William Mudd came to Dr. Mudd's house
</p>
<p>while we were there. I have no distinct knowledge of it ; but my
</p>
<p>recollection is that he came there.

</p>
<p>Q. You lived in that neighborhood down to what date ?
</p>
<p>A. I lived there until May, 1863. I left in May, and was
</p>
<p>backwards and forwards between that and Baltimore up to the first
</p>
<p>of August : sometimes I would go to Baltimore, and stay a few

</p>
<p>days, and then come back to the farm. On the first of August,
</p>
<p>when the working season was pretty well over, I went to Baltimore,
</p>
<p>and remained until October, until after I heard that some of the hands
</p>
<p>had left. When I got to Baltimore, the first of August, I think,
</p>
<p>my father had left ; and we did very little business until he returned,
</p>
<p>which was the first of September.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether there was any warrant for your arrest,
</p>
<p>or any charges against you ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. There was a general stampede, or a panic, in the
</p>
<p>whole community ; and a good many left then* homes, and went to
</p>
<p>friends' houses from place to place,  the whole community, pretty
</p>
<p>much.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Daniel J. Thomas, who was one of
</p>
<p>the witnesses for the prosecution in this case ?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him since a boy : I have not seen much of him
</p>
<p>during the last two or three years.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the reputation in which he is held
</p>
<p>in the community where he lives for veracity ?
</p>
<p>A. I know only from public rumor and general neighborhood
</p>
<p>talk ; and I think I can safely say it is very bad. I think there are
</p>
<p>very few men tliere who have any confidence in Mr, Thomas. That
</p>
<p>is the only sentiment I have ever heard spoken of him for several
</p>
<p>years back.
</p>
<p>Q. From your knowledge of his reputation for veracity, would
</p>
<p>you believe him under oath ?
</p>
<p>A. I should not. I could not.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you well acquainted with Dr. Samuel A. Mudd?
</p>
<p>A. Very well. I have known him since a boy.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his general reputation for peace, order, and good
</p>
<p>citizenship ?
</p>
<p>A. I have never heard the slightest thing against him. He has
</p>
<p>always been regarded as a good citizen, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his reputation as a man of peace ?

</p>
<p>A. I have never known him to have any difficulty with any one.
</p>
<p>I have always regarded him as a peaceful, quiet citizen.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his reputation as a master over his servants?
</p>
<p>A. I have always considered him as a very kind and humane
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 307
</p>
<p>master. I have never known any thing to the contrary, "with the
</p>
<p>exception of a difficulty with one man. That is the only act I ever
</p>
<p>knew him to be guilty of that questioned his reputation at all as a
</p>
<p>kind master.
</p>
<p>Q. ^What was that?
</p>
<p>A. Shooting that boy ; which he told me of, himself, the same
</p>
<p>day or the day after it happened.
</p>
<p>Q. Under what circumstances was that done?
</p>
<p>A. I know nothing of it, except what he told me.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You say you would not believe Mr. Thomas under oath :
</p>
<p>have you ever heard him charged with having sworn falsely in any
</p>
<p>case ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I have.
</p>
<p>Q. He is rather a talking and noisy man in the neighborhood, is
</p>
<p>he not?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He talks a great deal about the Union, and a great deal
</p>
<p>against the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not heard Mr. Thomas a great deal myself. I have
</p>
<p>seen very little of him the last two or three years.
</p>
<p>Q. He has the reputation of being intensely loyal to the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. I think he is a loyal man. I never heard that
</p>
<p>questioned.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you yourself been loyal to the Government of the
</p>
<p>United States during the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I have been guilty of any disloyal act.
</p>
<p>Q. I do not speak of acts : I speak of your sentiments. Have
</p>
<p>you, during this Rebellion, desired that the Government should
</p>
<p>succeed in suppressing it ?
</p>
<p>A. I never wanted to see two governments here.
</p>

</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>A. Repeat the question.
</p>
<p>Q. The question is, whether, during this Rebellion, you have
</p>
<p>308 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>constantly desired that the Government should succeed in suppress-
</p>
<p>ing it ?
</p>
<p>A. I can only answer that by saying that I never wanted to see
</p>
<p>this Government broken up. I would rather see one government
</p>
<p>here.
</p>
<p>Q. That is not a direct answer to my question. Will you answer
</p>
<p>that yes or no ?
</p>
<p>A. I hardly understand your question.
</p>
<p>Q. My question is, whether, during this Kebellion, you have
</p>
<p>constantly desired that the Government of the United States should
</p>
<p>succeed in its endeavors to suppress it.
</p>
<p>A. I think I have.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you have committed no overt acts of disloyalty?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware of.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever spoken kindly of the Government or encour-
</p>
<p>agingly in reference to it among your neighbors and friends ?
</p>
<p>A. I certainly have ; and I have persuaded young men from
</p>
<p>going on the other side.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you or not a member of the local military organiza-
</p>
<p>tions spoken of by one of the witnesses, the object of which was to
</p>
<p>stand by the State of Maryland in the event that it should take
</p>
<p>ground against the Government of the United States ?
</p>
<p>A. I belonged to a military company.
</p>
<p>Q. I believe you stated that you were at Dr. Mudd's in 1861
</p>
<p>with the other persons mentioned ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not suppose that the organization of which you were
</p>
<p>a member was at that time regarded as disloyal by the Government,
</p>
<p>and hence feared an arrest ?
</p>
<p>A. I hardly know how to answer that question. That was in the
</p>
<p>incipiency of the thing ; and it was hardly time for men to reflect,
</p>
<p>and give their minds room to see what would be the result of rebel-
</p>
<p>lion and civil war. It was in the start, when every thing was

</p>
<p>wild excitement and enthusiasm ; and, of course, I can hardly
</p>
<p>answer that question.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any knowledge of the existence of a treasonable
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 309
</p>
<p>political association in this country known as " Knights of the
</p>
<p>Golden Circle," or " Sons of Liberty " ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not : I know nothing of them except what I have seen
</p>
<p>and read in the newspapers.
</p>
<p>Q. At the time of which you speak, the fall of 1861, was the
</p>
<p>subject of the Legislature of Maryland passing an ordinance of
</p>
<p>secession much discussed among you ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Was no such event contemplated or desired?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know : I probably heard the subject spoken of very
</p>
<p>often, but I do not know that it was much discussed to any extent.
</p>
<p>I may have heard it spoken of.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not the subject of conversation between yourself and
</p>
<p>anybody ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware of. I may have heard it in crowds or
</p>
<p>congregations ; but, so far as conversing with any particular person
</p>
<p>on that subject is concerned, I have no knowledge of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been a member of any secret political association
</p>
<p>during the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I am not, and never have been, a member of any secret
</p>
<p>society whatever.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you to say, then, that although you would not
</p>
<p>believe Mr. Thomas under oath yourself 
</p>
<p>A. I only speak from his general reputation in the neighborhood ;
</p>
<p>from the way I have heard him spoken of, not from personal
</p>
<p>knowledge of him.
</p>
<p>Q. You have never heard him charged with speaking falsely
</p>
<p>under oath, and you say he has the reputation of being intensely
</p>
<p>loyal ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so : I do not know any thing to the contrary.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you name any of the persons who have been most
</p>
<p>decided in expressing this estimate of his character?
</p>
<p>A. I might take almost any one in that whole country.

<p>Q. Can you not give me the name of some one ?
</p>
<p>A. You may take any one in the neighborhood in which he lives.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever heard a man of known loyalty, an outspoken
</p>
<p>and ardent supporter of the Government, speak of Mr. Thomas as
</p>
<p>310 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>a man not to be believed under oath ? K you have, I would thank
</p>
<p>you to name that person.
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I have.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not rejoice at the success of the rebels at the first
</p>
<p>battle of Bull Run ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I did paiticularly.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know that you did ?
</p>
<p>A. i do not know that I did : I might have been like a good
</p>
<p>many others.
</p>
<p>Q. On which side were your sympathies at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose they were with them.
</p>
<p>Q. With whom?
</p>
<p>A. With the rebels at that time, I judge : I do not know now
</p>
<p>exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. When Kichmond was taken, on which side were your sympa-
</p>
<p>thies ?
</p>
<p>A. With the Grovernment, unless I am mistaken.
</p>
<p>Q. What Government ?
</p>
<p>A. The United-States Government. I wanted to see Richmond
</p>
<p>taken, and I wanted to see the war stopped.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did your sympathies undergo a change? and
</p>
<p>what produced that change ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you not give a cause for the change ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I can. I believed this Government was
</p>
<p>pursuing the right policy. All I objected to was the emancipation
</p>
<p>of slaves. I thought that was a wrong policy of the Government.
</p>
<p>I never questioned its right to pursue any other policy.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. What did you have to say about the draft?
</p>
<p>A. I joined clubs in regard to the draft.

<p>Q. Never?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware of. I did not object to it in tlie least.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you speak of Thomas's reputation for veracity as you
</p>
<p>[earned it from the common understanding in the neighborhood in
</p>
<p>svhich he lived during the war, or before the war ?
</p>
<p>A. I speak of him from his reputation for several years back ?
</p>
<p>Q. How many years ?
</p>
<p>A. Five or six years back, or probably more. That is what I
</p>
<p>tiave heard of Mr. Thomas. I have not seen a great deal of Mr.
</p>
<p>rhomas for two or three years.
</p>
<p>Q. What you have heard, then, of Mr. Thomas, on which you
</p>
<p>base your estimate of his reputation for veracity, was chiefly what
</p>
<p>y^ou heard before the war ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I know that Mr. Thomas has not borne a
</p>
<p>veiy good reputation for veracity in the neighborhood since he was
</p>
<p>a boy. I have heard him spoken of in that light as being one who
</p>
<p>would tattle a great deal, and tell stories, and say a great many
</p>
<p>things that were not so. That has been his general reputation, so
</p>
<p>Far as I have heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Under whose orders or authoiity was the company to which
</p>
<p>jrou attached yourself in 1861 organized ?
</p>
<p>A. By the governor.
</p>
<p>Q. AVhat governor ?
</p>
<p>A. Governor Hicks. We were commissioned by Governor
</p>
<p>Hicks.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the purpose of the company ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not really know what the organization was particularly
</p>
<p>For.
</p>
<p>Q. When was it organized ?
</p>
<p>A. In 1859, I think. We drilled here on the 22d of Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, 1860, at the inauguration of the statue. We were up here
</p>
<p>then.

<p>312 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Were there any truly loyal men in those companies ?
</p>
<p>A. Our company broke up immediately on the hreaking-out of
</p>
<p>the war, and a good many of them left.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did they go to when they left ?
</p>
<p>A. Some of them went to Virginia, and joined the rebel army.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. Were those who did not go made to take the oath of
</p>
<p>allegiance ?
</p>
<p>A. Most of them took the oath of allegiance.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they not treated and held by the Government author-
</p>
<p>ities as disloyal organizations ?
</p>
<p>A. I think they were so regarded after the breaking-out of the
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Were they held as disloyal organizations in 1859?
</p>
<p>A. I think not. The companies immediately broke up when
</p>
<p>the war occurred. We never drilled after the breaking-out of the
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Has this Daniel Thomas ever been in the House of Delegates
</p>
<p>of Maryland, or a candidate for a seat in that body ?
</p>
<p>A. He was a candidate for the Legislature, I think, a year or
</p>
<p>two ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the time you speak of his reputation being bad ?
</p>
<p>A. Not at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the time you speak of cover that time ?
</p>
<p>A. It was previous to that time. I never heard him spoken of
</p>
<p>in any other light,  hardly ever since I have known him.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Was he nominated by any convention ?

</p>
<p>Q. You never heard anybody put confidence in her for tnith?
</p>
<p>A. No, su' ; not those that knew her, about any thing. That is
</p>
<p>the reason I never knew whether she was a truth-teller or not. I
</p>
<p>used to talk to her sometimes ; but what little she told me, I never
</p>
<p>put much confidence in.
</p>
<p>Q. Was her general character among the servants that of a
</p>
<p>truthful woman, or not ?
</p>
<p>A. Indeed I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not put much confidence in her yourself?

</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you know John H. Surratt?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen him at his father's place, on the road from
</p>
<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you see him ?
</p>
<p>A. I think the last time I saw him was about a year and a half
</p>
<p>or two years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you not seen him for two years ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I have.
</p>

<p>recollection of him.
</p>
<p>Q. You never saw him since?

<p>where they formerly resided, and where they did reside at that time.

</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; no direct road : his place would be out of the way
</p>
<p>in o-oino; to the Potomac.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 331
</p>
<p>Q. Is Dr. Mudd's residence nearer the Patuxent than tlie Poto-
</p>
<p>mac?
</p>
<p>A. It is.
</p>
<p>Q. How far out of the way would it be for a person starting
</p>
<p>from Washington City, intending to strike the Potomac, say about
</p>
<p>Pope's Creek or Upper Cedar-Point Neck, to go by Dr. Mudd's ?
</p>
<p>A. It would make a very considerable difference.
</p>
<p>Q. State how much.
</p>
<p>A. I suppose, not less than seven or eight miles. Taking the
</p>
<p>direct route, you would not pass his house, at the nearest point,
</p>
<p>nearer than within six or seven miles, I think : I mean, by taking
</p>
<p>the Piscataway Road, which is the nearest road leading down to these
</p>
<p>points. If a person took the Bryantown Road, he would come
</p>
<p>within three miles ; but that would be out of his way in going to
</p>
<p>either of those points.
</p>
<p>Q. How much out ^ of the way would it be for a person starting
</p>
<p>to go from here, say to Port Tobacco, intending to strike the
</p>
<p>Potomac at that point, to go by Dr. Samuel Mudd's ?
</p>
<p>A. Seven or eight miles. The nearest point to Dr. Mudd's that
</p>
<p>he would pass would be, I think, at Troy, where the main road
</p>
<p>crosses.
</p>
<p>Q-. How far is it from Troy to Dr. Mudd's ?
</p>
<p>A. About seven or eio-ht miles.
</p>
<p>Q. Then, in going there and back, it would be about sixteen
</p>
<p>miles ?
</p>
<p>A. It would.
</p>
<p>Q. When you say it would be seven or eight miles out of the
</p>
<p>way, you mean that a person in travelling from Washington to Port
</p>
<p>Tobacco, to call at Dr. Mudd's, would have to travel sixteen miles
</p>
<p>more than he would if he kept on straight down ?
</p>
<p>A. The road winds a little ; and I do not know that it would
</p>
<p>make a difference of sixteen miles. It is a direct, straight road
</p>
<p>part of the way to Dr. Mudd's, and then it turns : there is a little

<p>winding. I suppose it would make a difference of ten or twelve
</p>
<p>miles at least, if not more, to go by his house.
</p>
<p>Q. Dr. Mudd's house is considerably nearer the Patuxent than
</p>
<p>the Potomac, is it not ?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; it is.
</p>
<p>Q. All the shipping from his farm is done on the Patuxent?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What point on this side is nearly opposite to Matthias Point,
</p>
<p>in Virginia? Do you know where Matthias Point, in Virginia, is?
</p>
<p>A. Pope's Creek, I think. I am not familiar with the names
</p>
<p>of places on the other side of the river.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you familiar with the course of the river  the general
</p>
<p>course of the Potomac  from here down ?
</p>
<p>A. Not very.
</p>
<p>Q. You suppose, then, from your knowledge of the direct route
</p>
<p>from here to Port Tobacco, that a person going by Dr. Sam. Mudd's
</p>
<p>would have to go at least ten or twelve miles out of the way ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. How far is it fi'om Baltimore to Dr. Mudd's house ?
</p>
<p>A. About sixty-five miles by rail and land.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say you formerly resided in that neighborhood ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long since ?
</p>
<p>A. I went to Baltimore in May. I did not remain there perma-
</p>
<p>nently.
</p>
<p>Q. Last May?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : two years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Where have you been since that, if you have not been in
</p>
<p>Baltimore ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been in Baltimore, and down in the country occasion-
</p>
<p>ally.
</p>
<p>Q. What country ?

<p>A. In Charles County, where I was raised.

<p>THE TRIAL. 333
</p>
<p>A. I sold my stock and farming produce, and what I had on the

<p>Q, What do you mean by your stock ?
</p>
<p>A, Horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, and so on ; and some furniture.
</p>
<p>Q. And you took notes, and would go down there collecting?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : sometimes I would go on business.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever have any business that took you along the line
</p>
<p>of the Potomac, or across the river ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : never across the Potomac River.
</p>
<p>Q. Or down the Potomac?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not been down the Potomac for four or five
</p>
<p>years.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you, since the commencement of this Rebellion,
</p>
<p>belonged to any secret political society of any name ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not.

<p>Q. Or disloyal organization of any secret character ?

<p>A. I have not.
</p>
<p>Q. Of any name?
</p>
<p>A. I have not. I do not and never belonged to any secret
</p>
<p>society of any sort.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know any thing about any goods shipped from Charles
</p>
<p>County, or what channels they were run through that country, to
</p>
<p>the rebels across the Potomac there ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.

</p>
<p>that county to the rebels ?
</p>
<p>A. T do not.
</p>
<p>Q. You know nothing about it ?
</p>
<p>A. No. I was in Bryantown on one occasion when there were
</p>
<p>some trunks stopped there that came down by the stage, and kept
</p>
<p>there a while. That was two or three years ago. I think they were

<p>sent down by stage from Washington ; and they were stopped, I

<p>think, by Dr. Bowman and Mr. Burch.

<p>like to dispose of. He asked me where it was. I took him to the
</p>
<p>window, and pointed the place out to him, and told hirti there it was.

<p>tracts,  one was a tract containing about a hundred and eighty
</p>
<p>acres, which was mine ; and the other belon2:ed to our estate : and

</p>
<p>the price or not. He asked me whether I had any horses to sell.

</p>
<p>said, " I will be down in a couple of weeks, and look at your land."

</p>
<p>coming down, but had not come. Said he, " That fellow promised
</p>

<p>A. Not that I remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you tell her who you were ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Louis J. Weichmann?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I met him once, and on that occasion only.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you remain at Mrs. Surratt's at that time?
</p>
<p>A. I was there two days and upwards, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your object, when you came to the city, in going
</p>
<p>to iMrs. Surratt's ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>and it was varied as follows : 
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court why you went there.
</p>
<p>A. I went there on a visit as much as any thing else,  nothing
</p>
<p>else. I had no business there particularly, except that.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your reason for not going to a hotel ?
</p>
<p>A. I knew them : they were acquaintances of mine, and I
</p>
<p>thought I could spend my time better there than I could at a hotel.
</p>
<p>I was alone.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you short of money at the time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was somewhat short of money.

<p>penses at a hotel, had you V
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I had. It was force of circumstances that
</p>
<p>caused me to go there at all. I merely called there because they
</p>
<p>were friends and acquaintances,  that is all.
</p>
<p>344 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. After you had made the aequamtance of Mr. TVeichmann,
</p>
<p>did you show him a cipher while you were there ?
</p>
<p>A. I showed him how to make a cipher while I was there. He
</p>
<p>made it himself.
</p>
<p>Q. Weichmann made it himself?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that a simple cipher, or a complicated one ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. It was the only cipher that I have ever
</p>
<p>seen. If I could see the cipher, I could tell you.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the cipher already in evidence,
</p>
<p>marked Exhibit No. 7.] Was it like that, or similar to it?
</p>
<p>A. It was similar to it. I do not think this is the one.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it the same thing?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it was hke this ; it was the same thing.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Weichmann at that time give you any information in
</p>
<p>regard to the number of prisoners that we had on hand ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as Mr. Weichmann was never asked any question in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to that matter in his cross-examination.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Did you have a conversation with Mr.
</p>
<p>Weichmann in reference to his going South V
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I had.
</p>
<p>Q. State what that conversation was, and what he said.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot remember his exact lang-uage ; but he said he would
</p>
<p>like to go South.
</p>
<p>Q. What reason did he give for wishing to go South?
</p>
<p>A. He did not give any particular reason that I know of : he
</p>
<p>did not state any particular reason.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing, in connection with his wishes to go
</p>
<p>South, of his sympathies ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge x\dvocate Bingham objected to the question,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as Mr. Weichmann had not been asked, on his cross-ex-

</p>
<p>sympathies at that time and place.
</p>
<p>The question was waived.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 345
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a conversation with Mr. Weichmann in regard
</p>
<p>to procuring a place for him in the War Department at Richmond,
</p>
<p>or in any department there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : he asked me if I thought he could get a situation
</p>
<p>there. I told him I did not know ; but the wounded and invalid
</p>
<p>soldiers generally had the preference there. I did not talk of getting
</p>
<p>him a situation there : he did not ask rae.
</p>
<p>Q. Then, as expressed to you, what was his purpose in wishing
</p>
<p>to go South, in addition to that?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know his purpose in addition to that.
</p>
<p>Q. But what did he say ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember exactly what he said in the whole conver-
</p>
<p>sation : I cannot remember his exact words.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember any portion of it?
</p>
<p>A. He said that he intended going South : that is about all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you that all his sympathies were with the
</p>
<p>South ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot tell you any thing more than the conversation that
</p>
<p>occurred between me and Mr. Weichmann. We were talking over
</p>
<p>the matter, and he said he wished to go South, and intended to go,
</p>
<p>and that he would like to go with me. I told him, that, if he in-
</p>
<p>tended going with me, he had better go then, as I did not know
</p>
<p>when I should cross the river again. He said that he was not
</p>
<p>ready to go at that time ; but as soon as he got his business arranged
</p>
<p>he was going. He asked me if I thought he could get a position
</p>
<p>in Richmond. I told him that I did not know whether he could or
</p>
<p>not ; that the wounded and invalid soldiers generally had the pre-
</p>
<p>ference of offices there, by an order of the War Department. He
</p>
<p>told me then that his sympathies were with the South, and that he
</p>
<p>thought it would ultimately succeed. That is about the amount of
</p>
<p>the conversation, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q, Did he say he had done all he could for that Government,
</p>
<p>referring to the South ?

</p>
<p>A. I believe he did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state that he was always a friend to the South ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question
</p>
<p>as leading.
</p>
<p>84G - THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. While jou were at Mrs, Surratt's, and in all the conversation
</p>
<p>that you had with her, did you learn of any treasonable plot or en-
</p>
<p>terprise in existence V
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did John H. Surratt ever give you a verbal message or a
</p>
<p>despatch in wi'iting to caiTy to Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; he never did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Mr. Weichmann give you a full account of the prisoners
</p>
<p>we had on hand ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question
</p>
<p>as leading ; and the question was varied as follows : 
</p>
<p>Q. Did he, or did he not, say any thing to "you with reference
</p>
<p>to our prisoners ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; he did.
</p>
<p>Q. State what that conversation was.
</p>
<p>A. We had some conversation in regard to the number of pris-
</p>
<p>oners on hand ; and he stated to me the number of prisoners the
</p>
<p>United-States Government had, and the amount they had over that
</p>
<p>of the Confederate Government. I really forget the number. I
</p>
<p>paid but little attention to it. I doubted it at the time ; and he
</p>
<p>said it would not admit of doubt, that he had the books in his own
</p>
<p>office to look at. That is about all the conversation there was, I
</p>
<p>believe, between him and me, that I recollect.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you say you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. I reside principally in King George's County  sometimes in
</p>
<p>Maryland.
</p>
<p>Q. Principally in Prince George's?
</p>
<p>A. No, sii' : King George's County, Ya.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you reside there ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been there, I believe, for about two years, off and on.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you leave there ?

<p>A. I left there some time in February, I think, or January.
</p>
<p>Q. Last February ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 347
</p>
<p>A. February or January ; I disremeinber wliich : I cannot say
</p>
<p>positively.
</p>
<p>Q. Whereabouts did you reside in Maryland ?
</p>
<p>A. Before the war, in Prince George's County.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you never been there since ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; only when I would go home occasionally : I never
</p>
<p>was there permanently.
</p>
<p>Q. Did your family reside there ? Did you reside there as a
</p>
<p>boy?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, before the war, but have never lived there per-
</p>
<p>manently since.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you first make the acquaintance of Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>and her family ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it has been about a year and a half ago that I first
</p>
<p>made their acquaintance.
</p>
<p>Q. Where?
</p>
<p>A. Down in the country, at their hotel.
</p>
<p>Q. About a year and a half ago ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. Was she living there at that time?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you become acquainted with John H. Surratt there at
</p>
<p>that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ever at any time accompany you to Kichmond ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. He never did ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What has been your business for the last year and a half?
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. I object to the question. In the examination in
</p>
<p>chief, the witness was asked nothing at all with reference to his
</p>
<p>business one way or the other. I do not object to his stating it,
</p>
<p>if he wishes to do so ; but I do not think it is relevant.

<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. We have a risfht to know
</p>
<p>tbe status of the witness, and the Court has that riglit. W"e have a
</p>
<p>right to know what his employment was, whether it was loyal or
</p>
<p>disloyal, and whether that fact was known to the family of Surratts,
</p>
<p>348 TEE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>to get at the position wliich he occupied in his attitude towards the
</p>
<p>Government. It is always competent to give to the Court the full
</p>
<p>status of the witness during the time about which he testifies. It
</p>
<p>is the ordinary course of cross-examination. We cannot, of course,
</p>
<p>give the' full history of the witness during the time about which his
</p>
<p>testimony is given to the Court, unless we can go into that history
</p>
<p>in full.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. I should like to hear the reason of the
</p>
<p>objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. It is objected to, first, because no question was
</p>
<p>asked the witness in the examination in chief in reference to what
</p>
<p>his business has been ; and, secondly, because it is entu-ely irrele-
</p>
<p>vant to the issue now before us in every way and shape.
</p>
<p>The Commission overruled the objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. I now object to the witness answering the question.
</p>
<p>He is not obliged to do so if his answer will tend in any way to
</p>
<p>criminate himself as to any thing in which he has been engaged ;
</p>
<p>and, if he does not wish to answer the question, he has the privilege
</p>
<p>not to do it.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. If it is placed on the
</p>
<p>ground of personal security, if the witness claims that privilege at
</p>
<p>the hands of the Court, I suppose he can make that claim, and I
</p>
<p>will not press that portion of the question .
</p>
<p>[ To the Witness.] It is your right, and I apprise you of it
</p>
<p>now, to claim protection at the hands of the Court against any mat-
</p>
<p>ter that will criminate yourself.
</p>
<p>The Witness. I can answer that question very willingly. I
</p>
<p>have had no particular occupation since I came out of the army.
</p>
<p>Q. By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. What army ?
</p>
<p>A. The Confederate army.
</p>
<p>Q. What portion of the Confederate army did you serve in ?
</p>
<p>A. I was in the First Maryland artillery of the Confederate ser-
</p>
<p>vice during the first year of the war; up to July, 1862, I believe.

<p>THE TRIAL. 349
</p>
<p>Q. Were you mustered out ?
</p>
<p>A. I was discharged on account of inability to stay in the ser-
</p>
<p>vice, and have never been in since.
</p>
<p>Q. Since that time, what has been your occupation and busi-
</p>
<p>ness '}
</p>
<p>A. I have not been employed at any particular business at all.
</p>
<p>Q. But what have you been doing ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not been doing any thing, scarcely.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you or not since then made frequent trips to Piichmond ?
</p>
<p>A. I have been to Ptichmond occasionally.

</p>
<p>A. From where I was stopping, in King George's County, I
</p>
<p>used to go to Richmond.
</p>
<p>Q. How frequently ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know : sometimes once a month, sometimes once in
</p>
<p>two or three months.
</p>
<p>Q. How frequently ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I have been there but twice since the 1st of
</p>
<p>April twelve months ago.
</p>
<p>Q. You have been there but twice since the 1st of April twelve
</p>
<p>months ago ?
</p>
<p>A. That is all, to the best of my recollection.
</p>
<p>Q. Those two visits were in what time in the year?
</p>
<p>A. The last of December and February, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you go alone in December ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I did : there might have been some gentleman with
</p>
<p>me.
</p>
<p>Q. Who might that person have been ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you cross the line of the blockade on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion ?
</p>
<p>A. I crossed from Westmoreland County.

<p>A. Nothing. I had no business there particularly at all, more
</p>
<p>than to see some of my friends, and to get some drafts. Our

<p>Maiyland boys generally sold drafts ; and I used to go down there
</p>
<p>occasionally to buy drafts from them.

<p>A. That is what I went for in December.

<p>wish to answer that question. Any thing relative to myself I will

<p>answer willingly.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. Your protection on the

<p>Washing-ton?

</p>
<p>something like that.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you take dinner with him?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. What did yoii go there for ?
</p>
<p>A. I had no business with him : I only went up there to get
</p>
<p>him to get a pistol I had lost.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you lose it ?
</p>
<p>A. I left it in a house in Biyantown ; and I asked him to go
</p>
<p>there and get it for me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he get it for you ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Why did he not ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know : I did not see him afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. You asked him if he would get it for you ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Why did you not go and get it at Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. I was going up the country, and I did not miss it until I
</p>
<p>fas passing near Dr. Mudd's place. His was the nearest house ;
</p>
<p>and I went into the house, and asked him to go to Bryantown and
</p>
<p>get it for me. He did not get it for me : it was got by another
</p>
<p>gentleman.
</p>
<p>Q. Now I will recur to the question I asked ycru before, and I
</p>
<p>want an answer. Who drew the drafts in Richmond that you
</p>
<p>brought here? and upon whom were they drawn, and the
</p>
<p>amount ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe I bought one draft from young Maniott, on his
</p>
<p>sister.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the amount of the draft ?
</p>
<p>A. A couple of hundred dollars.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 365
</p>
<p>Q. You had no other business of any kind with Dr. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>K. None at all whatever.
</p>
<p>Q. You had no communication with him, except in regard to
</p>
<p>that pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. That was all. His beins; the nearest house when I missed
</p>
<p>the pistol was the reason I went there.
</p>
<p>Q. You had left Bryantown, and were going on  where to ?
</p>
<p>A. I was coming up to Prince George's.
</p>
<p>Q. And your road took you near by Dr. Mudd's house ?
</p>
<p>A. Within about five hundred yards of it, I believe.
</p>
<p>By jMr. Clampitt :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you, or did you not, become acquainted with Mrs. Sur-
</p>
<p>ratt from the fact of stopping at the public-house kept on the prem-
</p>
<p>ises of Mrs. Surratt, at Surrattsville ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is the way my acquaintance came with the
</p>
<p>family.
</p>
<p>Q. Were not others in the habit of stopping at that house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; numbers.
</p>
<p>Q. It is a public-house ?

<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. You say the conversation between you and Weichmann took
</p>
<p>place up stairs, in his room ?
</p>
<p>A. I think a portion of it did. I am not satisfied that all of it
</p>
<p>took place in his room.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any other person present?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think there was.
</p>
<p>Q. Repeat all the conversation.
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect.
</p>

<p>366 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>and Miss Surratt, and you could not remember any of them. Why
</p>
<p>do you remember this conversation with Weichmann with more
</p>
<p>particularity than the others ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing more than they asked me questions as to it, and it
</p>
<p>occurred to my memory,
</p>
<p>Q. Now give to the Court in full what was said in that conver-
</p>
<p>sation.
</p>
<p>A. I believe I stated before all I can remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Just repeat to the Court the words as they occurred.
</p>
<p>A. He was speaking to me about going to Richmond.
</p>
<p>Q. Well, what did he say? Use his words as near as you can
</p>
<p>remember.
</p>
<p>A. He said that he would like to go to Eichmond with me. I
</p>
<p>told him, that, if he wished to go to Richmond with me, he had
</p>
<p>better go then : I did not know when I would go again. He said
</p>
<p>he was not ready to go at that time ; that, as soon as he got his
</p>
<p>arrangements made, he intended to go. He also asked me if I
</p>
<p>thought he could get a clerkship there. I told him that I did not
</p>
<p>know ; that the clerkships generally were given to the wounded
</p>
<p>and invalid soldiers there by an order from the War Department ;
</p>
<p>that I was not certain whether he could get a clerkship there
</p>
<p>or not. He went on to say that his sympathies were with the
</p>
<p>South.
</p>
<p>Q. Do not tell us "he went on to state," but tell us what he
</p>
<p>said.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot remember his conversation exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. You have stated heretofore what his words were : now give
</p>
<p>the words he used as to that matter.
</p>
<p>A. I can give nothing more than the substance of his conversa-
</p>
<p>tion ; that is all.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he say about his sympathies being with the
</p>
<p>South ?
</p>
<p>A. He only said that his sympathies were with the South ; that

</p>
<p>Q. That was all he said on that point?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; all.
</p>
<p>Q. He knew that you sympathized with the South ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 367
</p>
<p>A. I do not know what he knew about the matter.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you not, in talking about the matter, called the South-
</p>
<p>ern side your side ?
</p>
<p>A. Of course, as being from there, I claimed it as my side.
</p>
<p>Q. Then he knew that you sympathized with that side, did he
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. He might have thought so, no doubt. I do not know that
</p>
<p>he knew.
</p>
<p>' Q. Is that all that he said about his sympathies being with the
</p>
<p>South ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember any thing more.
</p>
<p>Q. That is all he said,  simply that his sympathies were with
</p>
<p>the South V
</p>
<p>A. That is all I can recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he say that they were then with the South, or that they
</p>
<p>had been ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he said they were then.
</p>
<p>Q. You think he said they were then with the South?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any other talk with him in reference to politi-
</p>
<p>cal topics then or at any other time ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember exactly whether I had or not. I do not
</p>
<p>know the fact.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the fact that he belonged to a company for the
</p>
<p>defence of Washington, and that he had had a quarrel in the house
</p>
<p>with the family there because he was loyal, and they were disloyal ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. The witness has not testified that they were dis-
</p>
<p>loyal.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. I am asking whether he
</p>
<p>knew that Weichmann maintained the cause of the Union, and, by
</p>
<p>reason of that, had quarrels with members of the household.
</p>
<p>A. I never heard that talked of.
</p>
<p>Q. Was nothing said about it at the time ?

<p>Q. Had you heard any thing about it in the house ?
</p>
<p>A. I had not.

</p>
<p>Q. Did you not know that one of the ladies of the house struck
</p>
<p>him in the quarrel, it ran so high at one time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not hear that that was done because he wore hlue
</p>
<p>pants ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice that he wore blue soldier pants in the house?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think he had blue pants on while I was there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you, at any time, see him wear blue pants there ?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw him but that one time.
</p>
<p>Q. Still he stated to you, that one time, that his sympathies were
</p>
<p>with the South ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know that he was trying to do more than glean from
</p>
<p>you who you were ?
</p>
<p>^A. I do not know what his intention was. His conversation
</p>
<p>with me was voluntary on his part ; not asked for by me.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know now that the fact was, that he was trying
</p>
<p>to get out of you your business for the purpose of turning you over
</p>
<p>to the military authorities ?
</p>
<p>A. If so, he did not succeed.
</p>
<p>Q. That was all the conversation that occurred at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. All that I recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know that he belonged to a military company
</p>
<p>here for the defence of Washington ?

<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did or did not Mr. Weichraann in that conversation state
</p>
<p>that he had done all he could for the South ?
</p>
<p>A. I think he did speak of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not say that he had always been a friend of the

<p>South ?
</p>
<p>A. If he did, I disremember.

<p>370 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>state to the Military Commission, through her counsel, that, in
</p>
<p>regard to the said Steinacker, she proposes to prove, that, shortly
</p>
<p>after the breaking-out of the war, he was a member of General
</p>
<p>Blenker's staff, serving in the capacity of a topographical-engineer
</p>
<p>officer ; that while under sentence of death at New Cumberland,
</p>
<p>for attempting to desert to the enemy, on or about the month of
</p>
<p>May, 1862, he made a second attempt to desert, with better suc-
</p>
<p>cess, and entered the lines of General Imboden's command, of the
</p>
<p>so-called Confederate States, on or about the month of May, 1862,
</p>
<p>scattered between Winchester and Romney, Va. ; and that most
</p>
<p>of the time from that date till May, 1863, he was employed as a
</p>
<p>draughtsman by Major-General J. E. B. Stuart, of the so-called
</p>
<p>Confederate Army ; that in May, 1863, the said Steinacker vol-
</p>
<p>untarily joined Company K, of the Second Virginia Infantry, as a
</p>
<p>private, and drew pay, bounty, clothing, and the usual allowances
</p>
<p>of a private soldier ; and that he was detailed as an assistant to
</p>
<p>Captain Oscar Hinricks, an engineer officer on the staff of INIajor-
</p>
<p>General Edward Johnson, of the so-called Confederate States
</p>
<p>Army, and remained with him during the Pennsylvania campaign
</p>
<p>of that year ; and that, in travelhng over Swift-Run Gap, he had no
</p>
<p>company until he arrived near Chancellorsville, where he fell in
</p>
<p>with Assistant Surgeon McQueen, of the so-called Confederate-
</p>
<p>States Army, and two other gentlemen in said service ; that he
</p>
<p>never ranked in said service as an engineer officer, or received the

</p>
<p>ing, or threatening to shoot, negi'oes charged with piloting United-

<p>States troops near Mine Run, Ya., and in other serious chai-ges ;
</p>
<p>that he stole moneys which were placed in his charge ; that he

<p>found guilty; and that, soon after the spring campaign of 1864, he

<p>The Judge Advocate. If the Court please, although the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of Yon Steinacker has no earthly connection with Mrs. Sur-

<p>ratt's case, I am perfectly willing he shall be recalled if he can be
</p>
<p>found. I do not know where he is. If he is not recalled, any
</p>
<p>matter which will discredit him can be introduced by the counsel.
</p>
<p>There is a great deal in the paper just read which is certainly not a
</p>
<p>fair or recognized mode of assailing the credibility of a witness ;
</p>
<p>but such testimony to impeach him as can be properly introduced

<p>under the rules of law can be produced.

<p>more knowledge of the whereabouts of that witness than the gentle-
</p>
<p>men themselves.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. I asked the question with the view of seeing
</p>
<p>what necessity there was for putting this paper on our record. As
</p>
<p>I understand it, the Judge Advocate has never refused, and I know
</p>
<p>the Court has not, to issue a summons for the witness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Clampitt. Certainly not.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. Then why make such an application ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Clampitt. Counsel for the defence have never stated that
</p>
<p>there was any delinquency, or any desire on the part of the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion to deny to the counsel for the accused any witness they may
</p>
<p>call for ; but it was for another reason and for another purpose that
</p>
<p>this paper was presented.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. The matter was brought to the notice of
</p>
<p>the Court the other day ; and I stated then, as distinctly as I do
</p>
<p>now, that this witness might be recalled if he could be found.

<p>The President. The decision of the Commission last week was,
</p>
<p>that if tlie witness. Von Steinacker, was desired by the defence,
</p>
<p>every effort would be made to obtain his attendance.
</p>
<p>372 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. We stated, iu reply to that, that we did not wish to
</p>
<p>have Von Steinacker called for the defence. Tlie object of his recall
</p>
<p>is simply to put certain interrogatories to him with a view to impeach
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>The Presi^dent. The decision of the Commission was, that if you
</p>
<p>did not wish to call him for the defence, as you had a full opportu-
</p>
<p>nity of cross-examining him when he was on the stand before, the
</p>
<p>Commission would not send for him. That was the decision last
</p>
<p>week.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. But, at the time he was examined before, the counsel
</p>
<p>for the accused were not aware that it was the purpose of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to connect Mrs. Surratt years back with Mr. Booth as
</p>
<p>aiding and abetting and counselling a conspiracy to assassinate the
</p>
<p>President ; and not knowing any thing about the man at that time,
</p>
<p>and supposing what he stated to be true, he was not then cross-
</p>
<p>examined at all. These facts have since come to light ; and it is as
</p>
<p>much for the benefit of the Grovernment that a man of that description
</p>
<p>should be known.
</p>
<p>The President. Is any thing known of the whereabouts of Von
</p>
<p>Steinacker ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. When he was brought here, I believe, he was a
</p>
<p>prisoner at Fort Delaware. He has since been released, and has
</p>
<p>gone no one knows where.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. I ask by whom the paper presented is
</p>
<p>signed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. It is signed by the counsel for Mfs. Surratt, 
</p>
<p>Reverdy Johnson, myself, and Mr. Clampitt.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. It is not supported by anybody who
</p>
<p>professes to have any personal knowledge of the matters set
</p>
<p>forth.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. It will be supported by Major-General Edward
</p>
<p>Johnson, who is here as a witness, and by members of his staff. If
</p>
<p>we be permitted to prove these matters without the recall of Yon

</p>
<p>Steinacker, it is all we ask.
</p>
<p>Mr. Clampitt. That will be perfectly satisfactory.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. For the same reason, no further cross-examination
</p>
<p>was made of Henry Fincgas at the time he was examined ; and
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 373
</p>
<p>afterwards, learning the character of the witness, his recall was asked
</p>
<p>for.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. I should like to know for which one of the
</p>
<p>prisoners this paper is considered necessary.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. For Mrs. Surratt ; but it has a hearing, in a
</p>
<p>degree, on all of them.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. Will the gentleman please state the connec-
</p>
<p>tion of the paper with Mrs. Surratt 's case ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. We wish to prove that Mr. Booth was not in Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia at the time stated by Von Steinacker ; that no such meeting
</p>
<p>of Confederate officers took place as he alleges did take place,
</p>
<p>where plans for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln were discussed. I
</p>
<p>think his language was, that one of the officers told him that " Lin-
</p>
<p>coln must go up the spout." We want to show that nothing of the
</p>
<p>kind was said ; that the officers of that regiment were not aware or
</p>
<p>cognizant of any such plan ; that they did not know Mr. Booth ;
</p>
<p>that they never saw him in Virginia at all, or in the camp of the
</p>
<p>Second Virginia Regunent ; and that if any plan to assassinate
</p>
<p>President Lincoln did exist as far back as that, or up to this time,
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt had no connection with it whatever in any way or
</p>
<p>shape, and knew nothing about it.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. It is not necessary to recall the witness,
</p>
<p>Von Steinacker, to prove that, certainly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. I suppose that we have the right to prove by the
</p>
<p>witnesses who are here that they would not believe Von Steinacker
</p>
<p>on his oath.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You can do that without
</p>
<p>recalling him. You can prove all the other allegations that it is
</p>
<p>competent to prove by other witnesses, if they know them.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. Inasmuch as this application has been
</p>
<p>heretofore brought to its notice, and the Court and myself at once
</p>
<p>acquiesced in an effort to secure the attendance of the witness, I
</p>
<p>wish the Court now to consider the question whether such a paper

</p>
<p>as this, so extremely defamatory in its character, shall be allowed to
</p>
<p>go upon the record here, when really it is the basis of no application
</p>
<p>which has not already been considered and granted ; whether there
</p>
<p>is any legitimate object to be obtained by spreading upon the records
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 32
</p>
<p>374 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>a paper so full of bitter aspersion upon the character of a witness
</p>
<p>who is absent as this is.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. I, for my part, object to the appearance of
</p>
<p>any such paper on the record, and wish to say now that I under-
</p>
<p>stand distinctly, and hold in supreme contempt, such practices as
</p>
<p>this. It is very discreditable to the parties concerned, to the
</p>
<p>attorneys, and, if permitted, in my judgment will be discreditable
</p>
<p>to the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr Clampitt. May it please the Court, standing in the position
</p>
<p>we do here, I would not desire to do any thing that would reflect
</p>
<p>upon counsel in the degree that a member of the Court has spoken
</p>
<p>of; but I understand my position here as one of the counsel for
</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun-att. We are here standing within the portals of this con-
</p>
<p>stituted temple of justice ; we are here for the purpose of defending
</p>
<p>the very citadel of life ; and we have felt it to be our duty, and
</p>
<p>incumbent upon us, to use every exertion that is in our power, and
</p>
<p>consistent with the forms that obtain before a court, to impeach or
</p>
<p>destroy the testimony of any witness that can properly be impeached ;
</p>
<p>and it was for that purpose that we have made this application^ and
</p>
<p>for the purpose of shielding the accused, if possible. It was at the
</p>
<p>same time our bounden duty, and an obligation that we owed to her,
</p>
<p>that we should spread before this Court the character of the witness
</p>
<p>that has been brought here on the part of the prosecution. I make
</p>
<p>this explanation, and I hope it will be satisfactory to the Court.
</p>
<p>General Wallace. It is not satisfactory to me, and for the
</p>
<p>reason, that in no instance has any person been denied the privilege
</p>
<p>which is sought for by this paper.
</p>
<p>General Harris. Neither has the counsel shown any connection
</p>
<p>that paper has with his client, or any one of the accused here.
</p>
<p>i\lR. Aiken. What the honorable member of the Court states is
</p>
<p>strictly true. The Judge Advocate has stated, that if Von Stein-
</p>
<p>acker can be readily found, or be found at all, no objection would
</p>
<p>be made to his recall. He stated that before, and he has stated it

</p>
<p>now. There seems to be a misunderstanding, however, in regard to
</p>
<p>what we asked for. We do not wish to summon him as our own
</p>
<p>witness at all.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 375
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bogiiam. Do you seek to put this
</p>
<p>paper on record ?
</p>
<p>Mr. x\iken. Yes : we wish it to go on the record. I will state
</p>
<p>further to the Court, that the paper was not presented to the Court
</p>
<p>without first being submitted to the senior counsel for the defence,
</p>
<p>the Hon. Reverdy Johnson ; and that he approved it, and thought
</p>
<p>it just, right, and proper.
</p>
<p>The question being put to a vote, 
</p>
<p>The President announced that the Commission had decided that
</p>
<p>the document should not appear on the record ; and he added, It
</p>
<p>appears to me the most proper way to invalidate the testimony of
</p>
<p>this witness is to bring other witnesses here. This man certainly
</p>
<p>cannot be expected to testify to his own iniquities.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. We have the witnesses here to prove all that we
</p>
<p>have stated, and we are ready to do it.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. Go on.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. If that is allowed, we do not care to have the paper
</p>
<p>go on the record.
</p>
<p>The President. Certainly there can be no objection to your
</p>
<p>invalidating the testimony of the witness in a legal way.
</p>
<p>The examination of witnesses was continued, as follows : 
</p>
<p>Thomas Davis,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly
</p>
<p>swt)rn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :

<p>Q. Where do you reside ?

<p>A. At Dr. Sam. Mudd's.
</p>

<p>A. Since the 9th of January last.
</p>
<p>Q. What has been your employment there ?

</p>
<p>thino;s that came to hand.

</p>
<p>A. He has only been away from home three nights during that
</p>
<p>time. One night he was at George Henry Gardiner's, to a party ;
</p>
<p>and the other times he came to Washington. On the 23d of March,

<p>Q. State to the Court how you fix the dates.
</p>
<p>A. The reason I noticed it so much was because the bam was

<p>you know, inasmuch as you did not see them before, that they were

<p>A. I only thought so on account of the horses being gone.

</p>
<p>A. I have seen him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him there last year ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear Ben. Gwynn's name, or Andrew Gwynn's

</p>
<p>A. He treated me very kindly, and all that were around him.
</p>
<p>He was very kind to us all,  I mean what few he had around
</p>
<p>him. I lived with him during the year ; and he never gave me a
</p>
<p>cross word during the year, or any of the rest, that I know of.

<p>Q. What did Mary Simms leave the house for, do you know ?
</p>
<p>A. Mrs. Mudd told her not to go away on a Sunday evening
</p>
<p>walking, but she would go ; and the next morning, she [Mrs.
</p>
<p>Mudd] struck her about three licks with a little switch. The
</p>
<p>switch was small ; and, from the licks she gave her, I do not be-
</p>
<p>lieve she could have hurt her.

</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what the general opinion of Mary Simms
</p>
<p>among the colored people is, as to her being truthful ?
</p>
<p>A. She is not a very great truth-teller. I lived with her last
</p>
<p>year ; and she is not a great truth-teller, because she has told lies
</p>
<p>on me.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what the colored folks around there generally
</p>
<p>think of her as a truth-teller ?
</p>
<p>A. They think she is a liar.

<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>

<p>get angry with you, he would tell a lie on you to get his satisfac-

</p>
<p>Q. That was the general opinion about him, was it?

<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>A. Dr. Sam's wife told me that he was gone to Washington.

<p>A. I live in Bryantown with Mr. Wai-d.

</p>
<p>George D. Mudd,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly sworn,
</p>
<p>testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewog :
</p>
<p>Q. State where you reside, and your business.
</p>
<p>A. I am a practitioner of medicine in the village of Bryantown,
</p>
<p>Charles County, Md.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you know the prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd.
</p>
<p>A. I know him.
</p>
<p>Q. What relation are you to him, if any ?
</p>
<p>A. His father and my father were first cousins : perhaps there
</p>
<p>was a little stronger relationship than that. He was a student
</p>
<p>Tinder me many years ago. I was his preceptor in the study of
</p>
<p>medicine.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether you know his reputation in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood in which he lives for peace, order, and good citizen-
</p>
<p>ship.
</p>
<p>A. I know of no one whose reputation is better in that regard.
</p>
<p>Very good.
</p>
<p>Q. State what his reputation is, if you know it, as a master.
</p>
<p>A. I have always considered him a humane man to his fellow-
</p>
<p>men, whether they be servants or otherwise. He always fed and
</p>
<p>clothed his servants well, to my knowledge, and treated them kind-
</p>
<p>ly, as far as I know.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you saw Dr. Mudd on the
</p>
<p>Sunday after the assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I saw him at church. He overtook me after that
</p>
<p>on my way to Bryantown, and I rode with him as far as the house.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether he said any thing to you about any persons'
</p>
<p>having been at his house.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. You need not answer that question. I
</p>
<p>do not think we have introduced the declarations of Dr. Mudd at
</p>
<p>that time. It is very clear the Government has not offered the

</p>
<p>declarations of the prisoner at that time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewxng. I propose to offer that statement for the purpose
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 337
</p>
<p>of showino; that Dr. Geor^-e iiluJcl. wlio states tbat he is a resident
</p>
<p>of Bryantown, and who, I will prove, is a man of well-known, un-
</p>
<p>questionable, and active loyalty, that the prisoner at the bar in-
</p>
<p>formed him that there were two suspicious persons at his house on
</p>
<p>Saturday morning ; told him of the circumstances of their coming
</p>
<p>there ; expressed to him a desire that he should inform the military
</p>
<p>authorities, if he thought it advisable, of the fact of their having
</p>
<p>been there ; stated to him that he wished him to take it direct to
</p>
<p>the military authorities, and not tell it at large about the streets,
</p>
<p>lest the parties or their friends might assassinate him [the prisoner]
</p>
<p>for the disclosure. I can imagine no declaration of a prisoner more
</p>
<p>clearly admissible than this. It accompanies, or is connected with,
</p>
<p>acts which they have shown of the preceding day, and of subse-
</p>
<p>quent days ; it is a part of the very gist of the acts and omissions
</p>
<p>by which he is sought to be implicated here ; and to refuse to allow
</p>
<p>him to show that he informed the Government, through one of its
</p>
<p>most loyal friends, of the presence of these men in his house, and
</p>
<p>his suspicions in regard to them, would be to strip him of a com-
</p>
<p>plete and admissible defence. On the subject of such actions 
</p>
<p>for this statement was an act  I read an authority from " Russell
</p>
<p>on Crimes," vol. ii. p. 150 : 
</p>
<p>" Wlien hearsay is introduced, not as a medium of proof in order
</p>
<p>to establish a distinct fact, but as being in itself a part of the trans-
</p>
<p>action in question, it is then admissible ; for to exclude it might
</p>
<p>be to exclude the only evidence of which the nature of the case is
</p>
<p>capable. Thus in Lord George Gordon's case, on a prosecution
</p>
<p>for high treason, it was held that the cry of the mob might be
</p>
<p>received in evidence as part of the transaction (21 How, St.
</p>
<p>Tr. 535). And, generally speaking, declarations accompanying
</p>
<p>acts are admissible in evidence as showing the nature, character,
</p>
<p>and objects of such acts. Thus when a person enters into land in
</p>
<p>order to take advantage of a forfeiture, to foreclose a mortgage, to
</p>
<p>defeat a disseizin, or the like, or changes his actual residence, or

<p>is upon a journey, or leaves his home, or returns thither, or remains
</p>
<p>abroad, or secretes himself, or, in fine, does any other act material
</p>
<p>to be understood, his declarations made at the time of the transac-
</p>
<p>tion, and expressive of its character, motive, or object, are regarded
</p>
<p>388 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>as verbal acts indicating a present purpose and intention, and are
</p>
<p>therefore admitted in proof like any other material facts. They are
</p>
<p>part of the res gestce.^^
</p>
<p>In a note to this section, the learned American editor of the
</p>
<p>"work, Judge Sharswood, gives the following among other decisions
</p>
<p>in this country : 
</p>
<p>' ' Thus the declarations of the prisoner may he admitted to ac-
</p>
<p>count for his silence when that silence would operate against
</p>
<p>him:' The U. States v. Craig, 4 Wash. C. C. Rep. 729.
</p>
<p>That is just the case here.
</p>
<p>" Wlienever the conduct of a person at a given time becomes the
</p>
<p>subject of inquiry, his expressions, as constituting a part of his
</p>
<p>conduct and indicating his intention, cannot be rejected as irrele-
</p>
<p>vant, but are admissible as part of the res gestae.''  Tennegy.
</p>
<p>Evans, 14 New Hamp. 353.
</p>
<p>It is to explain his silence up to the time of his making the com-
</p>
<p>munication to Dr. George Mudd, and to rebut the evidence of De-
</p>
<p>tective Lloyd as to his concealment, on the Tuesday following, of
</p>
<p>the fact that these two men had ever been at his house, that I pro-
</p>
<p>pose to introduce that statement in evidence. This statement was
</p>
<p>made before he could have known that any suspicions were directed
</p>
<p>against him. It was an act done during the time of that silence
</p>
<p>and alleged concealment, by reason of which they seek to implicate
</p>
<p>him as an accessoiy before and after the fact in the assassination.
</p>
<p>That conversation with Dr. George Mudd accounts for the silence :
</p>
<p>that conversation broke the silence. If the fact of his havino; been
</p>
<p>silent is to be urged against him, may not the fact that he broke
</p>
<p>the silence, and communicated all the facts to the military authori-
</p>
<p>ties, be introduced in his behalf? I hope the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>and the Court will mark the fact, that we do not introduce this for
</p>
<p>the purpose of showing that what Dr. Mudd then said was true.
</p>
<p>We do not introduce it for the purpose of explaining any thing as
</p>
<p>to the presence of these men in the house, or the acts they did

</p>
<p>there : we introduce it simply to- show that he communicated as
</p>
<p>well as he could to the military authorities the fact of their pres-
</p>
<p>ence, and, at the same time, gave the explanation of his caution
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 389
</p>
<p>then and his silence before. No authority could be more direct
</p>
<p>upon this point than the authority in United States v. Craig (4
</p>
<p>Washington Circuit Court Reports) , which is briefly stated in the
</p>
<p>note to Russell, which I before read : " Thus the declarations of a
</p>
<p>prisoner may be admitted to account for his silence when that
</p>
<p>silence would operate against him."
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. If the Court please, the principle here
</p>
<p>is almost too well settled to be the subject of discussion. While it
</p>
<p>is competent for the Government to give in evidence declarations of
</p>
<p>a prisoner on trial, his confessions, it is not competent for him to do
</p>
<p>so. That is perfectly clear ; but, when these confessions are intro-
</p>
<p>duced, he has a right to insist that the whole of them shall be
</p>
<p>given. That is the principle. Now, we have offered no declara-
</p>
<p>tions in evidence which were made by the prisoner at the bar on
</p>
<p>Sunday, the day spoken of by the witness. The ground, then, on
</p>
<p>which it is sought to introduce them, is, that they are part of the
</p>
<p>res gestcB. The res gestce at that moment had been completed.
</p>
<p>The res gestce in which he was involved, and which is the subject
</p>
<p>of arraignment on the part of the Government, had closed the day
</p>
<p>before. That consisted in his having received and entertained
</p>
<p>these men, and sent them on their way rejoicing ; having fed them ;
</p>
<p>having set the leg of the one whose leg was broken ; having com-
</p>
<p>forted and strengthened and encouraged them, as far as his hospi-
</p>
<p>tality and professional skill could do so, to proceed in their journey.
</p>
<p>That is the res gestce, the transaction on which the Government
</p>
<p>arraigns him ; and that was complete at four o'clock on Saturday
</p>
<p>evening. Now, on a subsequent day, on Sunday, after carefully
</p>

<p>do so, it is not competent for him to declare the motives by which

<p>his previous action was governed, because we have no means of
</p>
<p>reaching those motives ; we have no means of introducing testimony
</p>
<p>in regard to them ; we have introduced no testimony in regard

<p>sLall not manufacture testimony for his own exculpation inter-

</p>
<p>act of the prisoner he may introduce, because in regard to that we
</p>
<p>ourselves can introduce testimony ; but declarations which may
</p>
<p>have been framed upon careful review of his own conduct, solely
</p>
<p>for the purpose of his vindication against the accusation which he
</p>
<p>must have seen would arise from that conduct, cannot be heard
</p>
<p>upon any principle of testimony whatever.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewixg. I have one farther remark to make to the Court.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate says that the transaction was wholly closed.
</p>
<p>Not so. The charo;e here is a charo;e of concealment amoiio- others :
</p>
<p>and the concealment, as they have sought to prove it, was a conceal-
</p>
<p>ment not only of their presence while they were in the house, but a
</p>
<p>concealment, extending until Tuesday or Friday, of the fact of their
</p>
<p>having been there. Two of the witnesses for the prosecution who
</p>
<p>went there on Tuesday  two out of the four  said, upon their
</p>
<p>examination in chief, that Dr. Mudd denied that two men had been
</p>
<p>at his house. That was part of the testimony for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>It was not irrelevant testimony : it was legitimately applicable to
</p>
<p>this charge of concealment, which is made in broad and general
</p>
<p>terms, and which applies as well to his concealing them while they
</p>
<p>were there as to his concealing their course after they left, and the
</p>
<p>fact that they had been there. In support of that charge of con-
</p>
<p>cealment, as I said before, they have introduced testimony that he
</p>
<p>denied on Tuesday that they had been there ; and now they pro-
</p>
<p>pose to exclude us from proving that he informed the Government
</p>
<p>on Sunday that they had been there. It would be most unjust to
</p>
<p>exclude it, and contrary to the authorities which I have cited, one
</p>
<p>of which is explicitly and clearly in point.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. If the gentleman will frame his ques-
</p>
<p>tion so as to bring out simply the conduct of the party in the act he
</p>
<p>did, I shall not object ; but I must object to his declarations.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. The question has been asked. I cannot prove

<p>THE TRIAL. 391
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. The abstract question
</p>
<p>could certainly be asked, " Did Dr. Samuel A. Mudd direct you to
</p>
<p>go to the authorities, and inform them that these parties had been
</p>
<p>there ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I claim more than that : I claim the whole state-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection of the Judge Advocate.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you communicated to the military authorities
</p>
<p>in Bryantown the fact of any suspicious persons having been at the
</p>
<p>house of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd on Saturday.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State to whom you communicated it.
</p>
<p>A. I communicated it to Lieutenant Dana, who was the princi-
</p>
<p>pal in command of the military there at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you communicate it to him ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was on Monday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. What statement did you make to him ?
</p>
<p>A. I stated to -him that Dr. Samuel Mudd had informed me that
</p>
<p>two suspicious parties were at his house,  came there a little before
</p>
<p>daybreak on Saturday morning ; and that one of them had, as he
</p>
<p>said, a broken leg, which he bandaged ; that they were laboring
</p>
<p>under some degree of excitement,  more so, he thought, than
</p>
<p>should arise from a broken leg ; that these parties stated that they
</p>
<p>came from Bryantown, and were incjuiriug the way to the Bev. Dr.
</p>
<p>Wilmer's ; that whilst there one of them called for a razor, and
</p>
<p>shaved himself, thereby altering his appearance ; that he improvised
</p>
<p>a crutch, or some crutches, for the broken-legged man, and that
</p>
<p>they went in the direction of Parson Wilmer's. I think that is
</p>
<p>about the whole of what I told the lieutenant.
</p>
<p>Q. From whom did you get your information ?
</p>
<p>A. From Dr. Mudd, the prisoner.
</p>
<p>Q. What time on Monday did you make the communication ?

</p>
<p>A. I think, Monday morning.
</p>
<p>Q. By whose authority did you make the communication to
</p>
<p>him ?
</p>
<p>392 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. The mentioning of that matter to me, or any other matter
</p>
<p>bearing on an assassination, particularly such an assassination as the
</p>
<p>country and the world now mourn, was my warrant and authority
</p>
<p>from him or anybody else who knew me.
</p>
<p>Q. At the time he communicated it to you, was any thing said
</p>
<p>aboat communicating it to the military authorities ?
</p>
<p>A. When I left him, and was starting from him, I told him I
</p>
<p>would mention the matter to the authorities to see what could be
</p>
<p>made of it. He told me he would be glad if I would ; but that,
</p>
<p>if I could make the arrangement, he would much prefer that he be
</p>
<p>sent for, and that he would give every information in his power
</p>
<p>relative to it ; that, if it became a matter of publicity, he feared for
</p>
<p>his life on account of guerillas that might be infesting the neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say to what authorities you would mention it ?
</p>
<p>A. To the authorities in Bryantown.
</p>
<p>Q. Military or civil ?
</p>
<p>A. The military authorities abeady there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you make any other communication to any other military
</p>
<p>authorities of the facts stated to you by Dr. Samuel A. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. To whom?
</p>
<p>A. After that, I was sent for to my house, I think" on Tuesday
</p>
<p>afternoon. There were four detectives who asked me to go up in a
</p>
<p>room with them. They there questioned me very particularly rela-
</p>
<p>tive to this affair. I stated to them what I have' already stated
</p>
<p>here ; and, upon my inability to answer such questions as they pro-
</p>
<p>pounded, they immediately ordered their carriage, and asked me to
</p>
<p>direct them the way to Dr. Sam. Mudd's house. 1 told them that
</p>
<p>I would do it, or that I would go with them. They seemed to
</p>
<p>prefer that ; and I did go with them.
</p>
<p>Q. State what happened when you went there.
</p>
<p>A. These detectives went in : I was outside of the door. Dr. Sam.

</p>
<p>Mudd was not in the house. I was outside of the door, and saw
</p>
<p>him coming, and told him, as he entered the house, that the detect-
</p>
<p>ives had come there for the purpose of ascertaining the particulars
</p>
<p>relative to that matter which he had spoken to me about.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 393
</p>
<p>Q. You told him that ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; and that I had made the statement to the military
</p>
<p>authorities which he had made to me on Sunday, and that they
</p>
<p>were up there for the purpose of making special inquiry in reference
</p>
<p>to it. I had already stated to the detectives that I felt confident
</p>
<p>the doctor would state the matter just as I had stated it to them,
</p>
<p>and would not and did not stay in there during their examina-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you name the officers that went with you?
</p>
<p>A. One was named Lloyd ; another was named Gavaean, I
</p>
<p>think,  an Irishman. I would know the names of the others if
</p>
<p>they were mentioned, I think ; but I do not now recollect them.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Lieutenant Lovett one of the party?
</p>
<p>K. He was one.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Williams one of them ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : Williams was the fourth.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether any inquiry was made by any of them, after
</p>
<p>the conversation with Dr. Samuel Mudd, as to the route.
</p>
<p>A. When we got in the wagon,  or, I think, just before getting
</p>
<p>in,  they asked me if I would direct them the way to Parson Wil-
</p>
<p>mer's. It was then nearly night. I told them I certainly would
</p>
<p>do so if necessary. I then turned, and asked Dr. Samuel Mudd,
</p>
<p>who was standing outside of the door, what was the best route to take
</p>
<p>to Parson's Wilmer's ; which he gave me, and stated that there was
</p>
<p>a bad bridge around the way he directed us, which I remembered
</p>
<p>very well. Before we got to the main road leading to Bryantown,
</p>
<p>these gentlemen concluded  in consequence, it seems, of my stating
</p>
<p>to them that it was very Uttle out of the way to go back by Bryan-
</p>
<p>town to Parson Wilmer's  to go that way ; being a much better
</p>
<p>road, as I thought.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not any thing was said by either of those
</p>
<p>gentlemen about Dr. Mudd's having denied that the two men had
</p>
<p>been at his house.

<p>Q. V/ill you state whether you were in Bryantown on Saturday
</p>
<p>at the time of and after the news of the assassination of President
</p>
<p>Lincoln reached there ?
</p>
<p>394 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I was there when the news came, and remained all the even-
</p>
<p>ing ; did not leave the village.
</p>
<p>Q. What did jou hear as to the person or persons implicated in
</p>
<p>the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. Lieutenant Dana, on whom I called for information, told me
</p>
<p>that the party who had attempted the assassination of Secretary
</p>
<p>Sewai'd was named Boyle, and claimed him to be the same party
</p>
<p>who assassinated Captain Watkins, of Anne Arundel County ; and
</p>
<p>that the party who assassinated the President was supposed to be a
</p>
<p>man by the name of Booth, but that he thought he had not yet got-
</p>
<p>ten out of Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Boyle known in that region of country?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Had he been about there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he supposed to be about there then?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I think he had not been about there for three or
</p>
<p>four weeks, or later than two or three days after the assassination of
</p>
<p>Captain Watkins.
</p>
<p>Q. What was his character as known there ?
</p>
<p>A. I think his character was very bad.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he known as a desperado and guerilla?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you were at church on Sunday, and what was
</p>
<p>known there about the assassination of the President.
</p>
<p>A. I was at church on Sunday. It was believed, and I may say
</p>
<p>known, then, that the President of the United States had been assas-
</p>
<p>sinated. It was talked about.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it, or was it not, understood that Booth had not crossed
</p>
<p>the river?
</p>
<p>A, No one, to my knowledge, supposed that he had crossed the
</p>
<p>river at that time. That was my impression : I did not make much
</p>
<p>inquiry relative to it.

<p>TUE TRIAL. 395
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingiiajvi. You need not state any
</p>
<p>thing you heard him say there.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I think it admissible, as explanatory of the conduct
</p>
<p>of the accused during the very time of the occurrence of the
</p>
<p>offences charged,  because, as I said before, one of the offences
</p>
<p>charged is concealment, which relates beyond that Sunday,  as
</p>
<p>showing his frame of mind, his information, his conduct.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. If your honors please,
</p>
<p>that is not the point here. Supposing the declaration to be that he
</p>
<p>did not know any thing about them, the gentleman claims here to
</p>
<p>prove, on his own motion, the declarations of Dr. Mudd on Sunday
</p>
<p>at church. If we had introduced any declarations of Dr. Mudd at
</p>
<p>that time and place, I admit the well-known rule of law is, that
</p>
<p>whatever he said, and all that he said, at that time, is admissible on
</p>
<p>his motion ; what we did not give he would have a right to give :
</p>
<p>but I deny that there is any authority for introducing testimony of
</p>
<p>this sort as to his declarations at that time about this transaction.
</p>
<p>That is the question now. The gentleman read a while ago from
</p>
<p>a text that everybody is familiar with, which has relation to the
</p>
<p>declarations of third persons not parties to the record. There is
</p>
<p>not one single line in that text which he read which sustains any
</p>
<p>position he assumes here in regard to this matter. I desire to read
</p>
<p>the rule that does apply in regard to the prisoner on trial and his
</p>
<p>declarations,  Wharton's "American Criminal Law," vol. i. p.
</p>
<p>858,  699 : " Declarations made by a prisoner in his own favor,
</p>
<p>unless part of the res gestcB, are not admissible for the defence.
</p>
<p>Tims, on an indictment for larceny, the defendant cannot give in
</p>
<p>evidence his declarations, at the time of the arrest, of his claims of
</p>
<p>ownership in the property taken ; and, on an indictment against a
</p>
<p>prisoner for having in his possession coining-tools with intent to use
</p>
<p>them, he cannot give in evidence his declaration to an artificer, at
</p>
<p>the time he employed him to make such instruments, as to the pur-
</p>
<p>pose for which he wished them made. One indicted for murder

</p>
<p>cannot give in evidence his own conversations had after going half
</p>
<p>a mile from the place of murder. And so, too, when a prisoner, in
</p>
<p>conversation with a witness, admitted the existence of a particular
</p>
<p>fact which tended strongly to establish his guilt, but coupled it with
</p>
<p>396 THE TBIAL.
</p>
<p>an explanation, wliicli, if true, would exculpate him, it was held that
</p>
<p>the accused could not show that he had made the same statement
</p>
<p>and explanation to others."
</p>
<p>So it goes on all the way through. There is the law in regard to
</p>
<p>this matter. The man's declarations at the time he committed that
</p>
<p>murder, being a part of the transaction, were admissible ; but, after
</p>
<p>he had gone half a mile, they were inadmissible. Here is a party
</p>
<p>charged with harboring, concealing, and comforting a man, knowing
</p>
<p>him to be the murderer of the President of the United States.
</p>
<p>What he said in connection with the fact of his harboring and con-
</p>
<p>cealing him, at the time, to these parties, he has a right to prove,
</p>
<p>because we have brought out that evidence ourselves. If he said
</p>
<p>any thing in addition to what we have proved, he has a right to
</p>
<p>bring it out. Everybody knows that. But we have introduced no
</p>
<p>evidence whatever of what he said on Sunday at church. If we
</p>
<p>had introduced any evidence of that sort, I admit that, on the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples I have before stated, the accused would have a right to give
</p>
<p>ill evidence all that he said at that time and place ; but we have not
</p>
<p>offered any such evidence. If he is allowed to introduce his declara-
</p>
<p>tions on Sunday in regard to that transaction, and all that he said
</p>
<p>then,  because the question implies that the witness is to tell all he
</p>
<p>did say,  then he is to be allowed to introduce every declaration
</p>
<p>he may have made from that Sunday to this day, to everybody, and
</p>
<p>at every place ; and, as I have before stated to the Court on that
</p>
<p>subject, the law has hedged itself about so that criminals shall not
</p>
<p>make evidence at their pleasure in that way on their own behalf,
</p>
<p>and adduce it in court to exculpate themselves from crime. If there
</p>
<p>were such a rule as that, it would be an end of the administration
</p>
<p>of justice, provided the courts should give credence to such testi-
</p>
<p>mony.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I wish to call the attention of the Court specially
</p>
<p>to the fact, that the declaration as to which I am now inquiring was
</p>
<p>made during the time of the alleged commission of the oiFence of

<p>concealment. The offence of concealment, as charged and as
</p>
<p>attempted to be sustained by the proof on the part of the G-overn-
</p>
<p>ment, was a concealment after the fact of the persons having been
</p>
<p>there, and of the route which they took ; in other words, a conceal-

<p>THE TRIAL. 397
</p>
<p>ment after their departure, as well as during their stay. According
</p>
<p>to the theory of the prosecution, he was committing that oiFenee
</p>
<p>during all that time, from Saturday till the following Tuesday; and
</p>
<p>I say his declarations at the time of the alleged commission of
</p>
<p>the oftence are admissible. The declaration now inquired about was
</p>
<p>on Sunday, showing his knowledge and frame of mind with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the assassination ; and therefore I think it admissible. I
</p>
<p>assure the Court that I do not wish to take up its time by pressing
</p>
<p>upon it irrelevant or inadmissible testimony ; and, if I seem pertina-
</p>
<p>cious, it is only because I think we have a right to show what is
</p>
<p>here offered. I ask the decision of the Court on the objection.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection of the Judge Advocate.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Ewing,] At the time you speak of having made
</p>
<p>the communication to the officers, was any thing said to them by you
</p>
<p>about Dr. Samuel Mudd's having gone with one of the parties for
</p>
<p>a carriage ? and if so, what ?
</p>
<p>A. I told them so ; and that was a part that I forgot to mention
</p>
<p>before. I told them that Dr. Sam. Mudd went from his house with
</p>
<p>the younger of the two men to try and procure a carriage to take
</p>
<p>them away from his house ; that he went down the road towards
</p>
<p>Bryantown, and failed to get one ; and they left his house on horse-
</p>
<p>back.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you tell them any thing as to how the man's leg was
</p>
<p>broken ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think I told them that one bone of the leg was
</p>
<p>broken.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you tell them any thing as to how it was said to have
</p>
<p>occurred 'i
</p>
<p>A. From the fall of a horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state the distance of the church, at which you said
</p>
<p>you met Dr. Samuel Mudd on the Sunda}' after the assassination,
</p>
<p>from Bryantown?
</p>
<p>A. I should suppose it to be about six miles and a half.

</p>
<p>two men ? If so, what description ?

<p>398 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I do not think I gave them any.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether you are acquainted with Daniel J.
</p>
<p>Thomas, one of the witnesses for the prosecution ?
</p>
<p>A. I know him.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with the reputation in which he is held
</p>
<p>where he is known for veracity ?
</p>
<p>A. His reputation for veracity has always been very bad, I think,
</p>
<p>since ever I have known him.
</p>
<p>Q. How long has that been ?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him since a boy.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you state what his reputation for veracity was before
</p>
<p>the war ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think any better than since the war.

<p>Q. From your knowledge of his character for veracity, would
</p>
<p>you believe him under oath ?
</p>
<p>A. If there were a motive to misstate facts, I would not. .
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know any thing professionally of his mental condi-
</p>
<p>tion ?
</p>
<p>A. I have considered him an insane man.
</p>
<p>Q. State to to the Court how he is affected, and from what
</p>
<p>cause.
</p>
<p>A. I have seen him manifest a sufficiently abnormal condition
</p>
<p>of mind as to confer in the courts irresponsibility for a criminal
</p>
<p>act. He is not always so insane as this, however. There seem to
</p>
<p>have been exacerbations and remissions in his manifestations of
</p>
<p>insanity. Sometimes I have met him when he was' not in a more
</p>
<p>disordered condition of mind than eccentricity would imply, or
</p>
<p>rather not much more than an eccentricity apparently the matter
</p>
<p>with him. I would state, that, in approaching a question of insan-
</p>
<p>ity, I feel great diffidence and distrust. Though it belongs to no
</p>
<p>profession more than to mine, I feel as if I shall be perplexed when
</p>
<p>the great master-minds of the country who have studied and under-
</p>
<p>stand thoroughly all the forms of medical legal jurisprudence, as I

<p>apprehend gentlemen of the Court to do, particularly the Judges
</p>
<p>Advocate, come to be my interrogators on the subject of insanity.
</p>
<p>Q. Does his reputation for veracity, do you think, arise from his
</p>
<p>insanity alone ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 399
</p>
<p>A. I cannot distinctly say. I think it probable that his veracity
</p>
<p>is worse when the insane manifestations are stronger.
</p>
<p>Q. Is his reputation for veracity good during the times his men-
</p>
<p>tal condition appears to be best ?
</p>
<p>A. I have never heard it so estimated, and I have never so esti-
</p>
<p>mated it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Be good enough to tell the Court what works you have read
</p>
<p>on insanity ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not read many works specially on insanity, except as
</p>
<p>I find medical jurisprudence.
</p>
<p>Q. What work on medical jurisprudence have you read ?
</p>
<p>A. Taylor's and others ; and I have read a good deal on the
</p>
<p>matter of insanity in Dunglison's works, and other works on physi-
</p>
<p>ology.
</p>
<p>Q. Do any of them indicate how crazy a m.an has to be before
</p>
<p>he can be understood to be able to tell the truth ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that they do specially.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you wish to be understood as giving it as your opinion,
</p>
<p>to-day, that Dan. Thomas is so crazy that he does not know how to
</p>
<p>tell the truth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I mean to say that there seems to be a mental and
</p>
<p>moral insanity, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that at times he is more insane, mentally and moral
</p>
<p>ly, than he is at other times ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so.
</p>
<p>Q. And that, the less crazy he is, the more likely he is to tell the
</p>
<p>truth?
</p>
<p>A. I think he is more inclined to tell extravagant stories and
</p>
<p>tales when he is excited mentally.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know how he was when he swore here before this
</p>
<p>Court ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.

</p>
<p>Q. Are you prepared to give a professional opinion that he was
</p>
<p>so crazy then that he did not know how to tell the truth ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>400 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what condition he was in at the time he refers
</p>
<p>to in his testimony, when he heai'd Dr. Mudd make the statement
</p>
<p>he details ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot state whether he was sensible enough then to
</p>
<p>understand the truth or not?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot exactly. I have not seen him often of late.
</p>
<p>Q. What is moral insanity ?
</p>
<p>A. I look upon moral insanity where a person is particularly
</p>
<p>inclined to he immoral. That is the view I take of it. There are
</p>
<p>various ways.
</p>
<p>Q. What do you call mental insanity?
</p>
<p>A. When they are not capable of discriminating and appreciat-
</p>
<p>ing things as the sane mind.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever know Dan. Thomas when he was able to walk
</p>
<p>about, that he was not capable of understanding plain words when a
</p>
<p>man spoke to him about plain matters?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I did ; but I could state some reasons
</p>
<p>why I have considered him insane.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What is the form of insanity under which Mr. Thomas
</p>
<p>labors ?
</p>
<p>A. There is no specific form that I know of, except at times a pe-
</p>
<p>culiar excitement, and inability to appreciate matters and things as
</p>
<p>other people do. It is not dementia ; it is not a monomania ; it is
</p>
<p>not what is called aberration of mind. There are certain forms of
</p>
<p>insanity which exacerbate and remit, and are known by no specific
</p>
<p>name as any particular form of insanity.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think the form of insanity under which he is labor-
</p>
<p>ing would lead him to imagine that he heard a conversation, for
</p>
<p>instance, that he never did hear ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen him in a mood of mind when I would not doubt
</p>
<p>but that he would be so insane.

</p>
<p>Q. Would fancy that he had heard something said that was nc
</p>
<p>said?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have known him to labor under the most decidod
</p>
<p>delusions and hallucinations.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 401
</p>
<p>Q. You have known him to narrate things which should have
</p>
<p>occurred, and which he should have heard, that to your knowledge
</p>
<p>were purely imaginary,  that he never did heai* ?
</p>
<p>A. No doubt of it : yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You have known that yourself?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; oftentimes.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you entertained the opinion that Mr. Thomas
</p>
<p>was not of sound mind ?
</p>
<p>A. I went to a family school in our neighborhood with Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas when he was a small boy. I was his senior, perhaps, four
</p>
<p>or five years. There was something very eccentric and amusing
</p>
<p>about him at that time, different from other boys ; and he was a
</p>
<p>source of amusement in the way of eccentricity to his schoolmates.
</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, or perhaps longer than that, his insane
</p>
<p>condition of mind seemed to manifest itself in the estimation of
</p>
<p>everybody in our neighborhood. I say everybody,  yes, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve almost every one. The common expression was that Daniel
</p>
<p>Thomas was crazy.
</p>
<p>Q. I ask the question of time. How long have you entertained
</p>
<p>that opinion ?
</p>
<p>A. I say, seven or eight years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever expressed an opinion to any one that he was
</p>
<p>a man not of sound mind ?
</p>
<p>A. Over and over again, and a long time ago, before this
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>Q, Do you know that he has ever been objected to as a witness
</p>
<p>before a court of justice on the ground that he was not of sound
</p>
<p>mind ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever known him to be a witness in a coui*t of jus-
</p>
<p>tice ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : on one occasion I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Was his evidence objected to on the ground of insanity?

</p>
<p>A. I think not.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you have known Dr. Samuel Mudd a good while ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his reputation,  a loyal, or disloyal man ?
</p>
<p>34*
</p>
<p>402 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. From my association with him, I have had to consider him
</p>
<p>as sympathizing with the South.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever know him to harbor persons who were rebels
</p>
<p>and in sympathy with the South ?
</p>
<p>A. Never. I know of no treasonable or disloyal act of his.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not know that that was the resort of persons of dis-
</p>
<p>loyal sentiments ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I have generally considered Dr. Sam. Mudd as
</p>
<p>very temperate in his discussions and expressions relative to the
</p>
<p>war. His ordinary matter was the right or legality of secession,
</p>
<p>which he maintained. He has generally, however, spoken temper-
</p>
<p>ately, never using abusive or opprobrious epithets towards th^
</p>
<p>heads of the Government. In saying that he was very temperate
</p>
<p>in this regard, I must add, if I may be allowed, very much more
</p>
<p>so than many of the citizens of benighted Charles County, in South-
</p>
<p>ern Maryland.
</p>
<p>Q. There were certain local military organizations in the neigh-
</p>
<p>borhood in the early part of the war, companies that were organ-
</p>
<p>ized : what was their object ?
</p>
<p> A. There was an organization at Port Tobacco, the object of
</p>
<p>which, I think, was treasonable. I think it probable, but I am not
</p>
<p>satisfied of that. That was my impression at the time, though it
</p>
<p>was said it was for the purpose of quelling insurrections, &c., in
</p>
<p>the neighborhood. It may have been so. I have regarded Dr.
</p>
<p>Sam. Mudd, for several months prior to the fall of Richmond and
</p>
<p>the surrender of the rebel army of Lee, as taking a very handsome
</p>
<p>prospective view of the downfall of the Rebellion. I remember
</p>
<p>administering an oath to him last year, and was forcibly impressed
</p>
<p>with the respect and reverence with which he took the oath, making
</p>
<p>a decided contrast from many others to whom I administered the
</p>
<p>oath on that occasion ; and, so far as I know, he has abided the
</p>
<p>provisions of that oath.

</p>
<p>Q. When did you administer the oath you speak of to Samuel
</p>
<p>A. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. It was at the time, if I remember rightly, when the sense of
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 403
</p>
<p>the people was taken relative to the calling of a convention to frame
</p>
<p>a new constitution for the State of Maryland,  in June or July
</p>
<p>of last year : I do not remember, or it may have been earlier.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you acting in an official capacity ?
</p>
<p>A. I was rather improvised by two of the judges as the chief
</p>
<p>judge of the election that day, in the absence of the judge. I
</p>
<p>think I administered the oath to some two hundred that day.
</p>
<p>Q. For how long a time past has he spoken of the downfall of
</p>
<p>the Rebellion as being assured ?
</p>
<p>A. I think from and after that time, so far as I can gather, if
</p>
<p>not before.
</p>
<p>Colonel Martin Burke, U. S. A.,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you knew Robeii, C.
</p>
<p>Kennedy, who was hanged at New York in March last ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I had charge of him, and had him hung.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting a paper in writing to the witness.] Look at
</p>
<p>that paper, and say whether or not it is the confession he made be-
</p>
<p>fore his death.
</p>
<p>A. It is the statement made in my presence by him.
</p>
<p>Q. How long before his execution ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect exactly. It could not have been very
</p>
<p>long,  I think a day or so before.
</p>
<p>The paper was read, as follows : 
</p>
<p>Confession of Robert C. Kennedy.
</p>
<p>After my escape from Johnson's Island, I went to Canada, where
</p>
<p>I met a number of Confederates. They asked me "if I was will-
</p>
<p>ing to go on an expedition." I replied, " Yes, if it is in the service
</p>
<p>of my country." They said, " It is all right," but gave no inti-
</p>
<p>mation of its nature, nor did I ask for any. I was then sent to
</p>
<p>New Yoik, where I staid some time. There were eight men in

</p>
<p>our party, of whom two tied to Canada. After we had been in
</p>
<p>404 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>New York tbree weeks, we were told that the object of the expe-
</p>
<p>dition was to retaliate on the North for the atrocities in the Shen-
</p>
<p>andoah Valley. It was designed to set fire to the city on the night
</p>
<p>of the Presidential election ; but the phosphorus was not ready,
</p>
<p>and it was put oflf until the 25th of November. I was stopping
</p>
<p>at the Belmont House, but moved into Prince Street. I set fire
</p>
<p>to four places,  Barnum's Museum, Lovejoy's Hotel, Tammany
</p>
<p>Hotel, and the New-England House. The others only started fires
</p>
<p>in the house where each was lodging, and then ran off. Had they
</p>
<p>all done as I did, we would have had thirty-two fires, and played
</p>
<p>a huge joke on the fire-department. I know that I am to be hung
</p>
<p>for setting fire to Barnum's Museum ; but that was only a joke. I
</p>
<p>had no idea of doino- it. I had been drinkino-, and went in there
</p>
<p>with a friend ; and, just to scare the people, I emptied a bottle of
</p>
<p>phosphorus on the floor. We knew it wouldn't set fire to the
</p>
<p>wood ; for we had tried it before, and at one time concluded to give
</p>
<p>the whole thing up.
</p>
<p>There was no fiendishness about it. After setting fire to my
</p>
<p>four places, I walked the streets all night, and went to the Ex-
</p>
<p>change Hotel early in the morning. We all met there that morn-
</p>
<p>ing and the next night. My friend and I had rooms there ; but
</p>
<p>we sat in the office nearly all the time, reading the papers, while
</p>
<p>we were watched by the detectives, of whom the hotel was full. I
</p>
<p>expected to die then ; and, if I had, it would have been all right :
</p>
<p>but now it seems rather hard. I escaped to Canada, and was glad
</p>
<p>enough when I crossed the bridge in safety.
</p>
<p>I desired, however, to return to my command, and started with
</p>
<p>my friend for the Confederacy, via Detroit. Just before entering
</p>
<p>the city, he received an intimation that the detectives were on the
</p>
<p>lookout for us ; and, giving me a signal, he jumped from the cars.
</p>
<p>I didn't notice the signal, but kept on, and was arrested in the
</p>
<p>depot.

<p>thought of. We wanted to let the people of the North understand
</p>
<p>that there are two sides to this war ; and that they can't be rolling
</p>
<p>in wealth and comfort while we at the South are bearing all the
</p>
<p>hardships and privations.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 405
</p>
<p>In retaliation for Sheridan's atrocities in the Shenandoah Valley,
</p>
<p>we desired to destroy property, not the lives of women and chil-
</p>
<p>dren ; although that would, of course, have followed in its train.

<p>HosEA B. Carter,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In New Hampshire.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you were in Montreal, Canada, during
</p>
<p>the last fall.
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. In what hotel were you there ?
</p>
<p>A. St. Lawrence Hall.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or not meet there George N. Sanders, Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson, Clement C. Clay, and J. Wilkes Booth, or any of
</p>
<p>them ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Name the persons of that circle whom you met.
</p>
<p>" A. George N. Sanders, Beverly Tucker, Dr. Blackburn, J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth, Dr. Pollen, and many others whose names I do not
</p>
<p>now remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember Jacob Thompson among them ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember that I saw Thompson there. I saw
</p>
<p>Thompson at Niagara Falls on the 17th of June.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you at that hotel in Montreal ?
</p>
<p>A. From the 9th or 10th of September until the first day of
</p>
<p>February last.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you observed the men whom you have

<p>named in intimate association with each other during that time.
</p>
<p>A. All the Southerners that boarded at the house  there were
</p>
<p>some twenty or thirty of them  usually associated together, and
</p>

</p>
<p>very little witli otlier people who came there, either Englishmen or
</p>
<p>Americans.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know J. Wilkes Booth before that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you observe him in intimate association with Sanders
</p>
<p>and others of that class in Montreal ?
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Frequently ?
</p>
<p>A. Frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, and see whether you recog-
</p>
<p>nize any of them as the persons that you met in Canada.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot swear to either of them.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember to have heard the name of John Surratt
</p>
<p>spoken of there in this circle of men ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I do.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember having heard the name of Payne ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I used to see Payne every morning nearly, but
</p>
<p>not the man that you call Payne here. There were several Paynes,
</p>
<p>brothers.
</p>
<p>Q. There was a man there of that name ?
</p>
<p>A. There was a Payne,  I think they called him John,  one
</p>
<p>of the Payne brothers. Two of them were arrested for the St.
</p>
<p>Albans raid ; and one of them was afterwards discharged, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that is not the same person who is here ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think it is the same person. This man [pointing to
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne, one of the accused] looks something like Payne ;
</p>
<p>but I do not think I have ever seen him before.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Dr. Blackburn there the greater part of the time you
</p>
<p>speak of?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I think he came there when the Donegana Hotel
</p>
<p>closed, which was about the 20th of October last.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not seem to be associated with J. Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>Beverly Tucker, and the others you have named, on terms of

</p>
<p>intimacy ?
</p>
<p>A. He was with all but Booth. Whether he came there before
</p>
<p>Booth did, I cannot say ; but he was one of that clique of men who
</p>
<p>were to";ether known there as Confederate men.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 407
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. You say you saw in Canada two persons by the name of
</p>
<p>Payne, neither of whom was the prisoner at the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear any thing about those persons, or where they
</p>
<p>,anie from ?
</p>
<p>A. Only what I heard from reputation.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you hear ?
</p>
<p>A. I heard that they were a party who originally came from
</p>
<p>Kentucky, and that they had been in the counterfeiting business.
</p>
<p>Q. What were their names, do you know ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not remember their first names, except that I think one
</p>
<p>was named John.
</p>
<p>Q. What time was it when you saw those men ?
</p>
<p>A. In October, some time. The John Payne that boarded there
</p>
<p>used to go to the house every day from the time I went there until
</p>
<p>I came away.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see, about the same time that you knew those
</p>
<p>Paynes, a man by the name of Montgomery?
</p>
<p>A. I saw no man that was called by that name, I think.
</p>
<p>Q, Did you ever see those two Paynes in company with a man
</p>
<p>named Cleary ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I have seen Cleary there, and I think I have seen
</p>
<p>John Payne with him; but I cannot say I have seen the other
</p>
<p>Payne with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see them, or either of them, in company with
</p>
<p>Clement C. Clay?
</p>
<p>A. I never saw Clay but very little at St. Lawrence Hall.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you have seen one of them in company with
</p>
<p>Cleary ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so : I would not say positively ; but I have seen
</p>
<p>them in com.pany with Sanders and Tucker and Blackburn every
</p>
<p>day.

<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Can you name any other rebels who were in Canada, and
</p>
<p>who seemed to constitute a part of this circle of which you have
</p>
<p>been speaking?
</p>
<p>408 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the rebel general Carroll, from Memphis, Tenn.,
</p>
<p>I think ; Dr. Wood, a young man about thirty-five years of age ;
</p>
<p>a gentleman by the name of Clark ; an old gentleman from Flor-
</p>
<p>ida, that wore a cue,  I think his name was Westcott.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember a man from Indiana by the name of
</p>
<p>Dodd?
</p>
<p>A. I do not place him now.
</p>
<p>Q. A man by the name of J. C. Walker ?
</p>
<p>A. No. I knew many men there, and saw them every day,
</p>
<p>whose names I did not know. They rather gave me the cold
</p>
<p>shoulder, after they came to suppose my sympathies were with the
</p>
<p>North, and had very little to say to me ; and I had no disposition
</p>
<p>to mix with them.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you use to see a gentleman about the St. Lawrence
</p>
<p>Hotel by the name of Wallace?
</p>
<p>A. I have heard the name of Wallace ; but I cannot associate
</p>
<p>it with any face now.
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot recollect him well enough to identify him at all,
</p>
<p>can you ?
</p>
<p>A. No : not by the name of Wallace.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect a Dr. Merritt ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I might remember him if I could see his face or
</p>
<p>his photograph. My memory of names is not very good ; but my
</p>
<p>memory of faces is very good.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Clement C. Clay have a room at the St. Lawrence Hall
</p>
<p>Hotel ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not say. The other parties that I have mentioned
</p>
<p>did, with the exception of Pay net
</p>
<p>Q. Did you use to see Payne go to their rooms ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I have seen him go up stau'S, and afterwards
</p>
<p>come down stairs again, and go in the direction of then- rooms : and
</p>
<p>I once saw him come out of Sanders's room ; but I never saw him

</p>
<p>go into their rooms.
</p>
<p>Q, He bore no resemblance to any of the prisoners at the bar?
</p>
<p>A. He looked a very little like that one [pointing to the pris-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 409
</p>
<p>oner, Lewis Payne] ; but he is an older man. He may be some
</p>
<p>relation to him ; but I should hardly think it.
</p>
<p>Q. It is not that one [Payne] ?
</p>
<p>A. I should not think he was a relation of his. There is no
</p>
<p>family resemblance, so that I would say he was of the same family ;
</p>
<p>but then it might be.
</p>
<p>Godfrey Joseph Hyams,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court where you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. I reside now in Detroit, Mich.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you reside during the past year ?
</p>
<p>A. In Toronto, Canada.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether, while there, you made the acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance of a Dr. Blackburn ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : in the Queen's Hotel, some time about the middle
</p>
<p>of December, 1863.
</p>
<p>Q. You have known him since then ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I knew him previous to that by sight. I never
</p>
<p>had any conversation with him before that.
</p>
<p>Q. You knew him as a Confederate in the Confederate service ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not know as to that particularly. I did not know that
</p>
<p>he was in the Confederate service.
</p>
<p>Q. I mean that he was doing his work for the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what arrangements, if any, this Dr. Black-
</p>
<p>bum made with you for the purpose of introducing the yellow-fever
</p>
<p>into the cities of the United States ? Give all the particulars of
</p>
<p>that arrangement, and what was done under it.
</p>
<p>A. I was introduced to him through the Rev. Stuart Robinson,
</p>
<p>at the Queen's Hotel, in Toronto. Dr. Blackburn was then about to
</p>
<p>take South some men, soldiers who had escaped from Federal prisons ;

</p>
<p>and I asked to go South myself. He asked me if I wanted to go
</p>
<p>South and serve the Confederacy. I said I did. He then told me
</p>
<p>vol.. II. 35
</p>
<p>410 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>to come up stairs ; lie wanted to speak to me. He took me up
</p>
<p>stairs in a private room ; and lie pledged his word there as a Free-
</p>
<p>mason, and offered his hand in friendship, that he would never de-
</p>
<p>ceive me, and wanted to place confidence in me for an expedition.
</p>
<p>He then asked me if I would like to go on an expedition. I told
</p>
<p>him I would not care if I did. He said I would make an inde-
</p>
<p>pendent fortune by it ; that I would make at least one hundred
</p>
<p>thousand dollars ; that I would get more honor and glory to my
</p>
<p>aame than General Lee had ; and that I would be of more assistance
</p>
<p>to the Confederate Government than if I was to take one hundred
</p>
<p>thousand soldiers to re-enforce General Lee. I considered all that,
</p>
<p>and pledged my word that I would go, and said I would go if I
</p>
<p>could do any good. He then told me that he wanted me to take a
</p>
<p>certain quantity of clothing  he did not state how much, but he
</p>
<p>said they would consist of shirts and coats and under-clothing 
</p>
<p>into the States, and dispose of them by auction ; that I was to take
</p>
<p>them to Washington City, to Norfolk, and as far South as I could
</p>
<p>possibly go where the Federal Government held possession and had
</p>
<p>the most troops, and to sell them on a hot day or of a night ; that
</p>
<p>it did not matter what money I got for the clothes ; I should just
</p>
<p>dispose of them, and come away.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he tell you he would give you for this service ?
</p>
<p>A. He told me I should have $100,000 for it, and $60,000 of
</p>
<p>it directly after I landed back at Toronto ; but he said that would
</p>
<p>not be a circumstance to what I should get. He said I might make
</p>
<p>ten times $100,000.
</p>
<p>Q. In what way were you to get possession of these trunks of
</p>
<p>clothes ?
</p>
<p>A. I was to stay in Toronto, and go on with my legitimate
</p>
<p>business until I heard from him. He told me I must go back to
</p>
<p>my business ; keep quiet ; and, if I moved anywhere, I was to
</p>
<p>acquaint Dr. Stuart Robinson where I went to, and he would tele-
</p>
<p>graph for me, or write to me through him, some time about the first

</p>
<p>of May, or some time in the month of May, 1864. I went to my
</p>
<p>work, and worked on until the 8th day of June, 1864. It was on a
</p>
<p>Saturday night. I had been out to take a pair of boots home to a
</p>
<p>customer of mine; and, when I returned home, my wife had a letter
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 411
</p>
<p>for me from Br. Stuart Robinson, which he had left in passing
</p>
<p>there. I read the letter ; I went out to see Dr. Robinson ; and I
</p>
<p>asked him what I was to do about it : he said he did not know any
</p>
<p>thing at all about it ; that he did not want to furnish any means to
</p>
<p>commit an overt act against the United-States Government ; that the
</p>
<p>best thing I could do would be to wait until Monday, and then bor-
</p>
<p>row as much money as would take me down to Montreal from Mr.
</p>
<p>Preston. I then borrowed some money from Mr. Preston, who keeps
</p>
<p>the tobacco manufactory at Toronto, and went down to Montreal,
</p>
<p>and there got money from Mr. Slaughter, according to the directions
</p>
<p>contained in the letter. The letter contained instructions as to what
</p>
<p>was to be done, and that I was to proceed from Montreal to Halifax
</p>
<p>to meet Dr. Blackburn. He wrote the letter on the 10th of May,
</p>
<p>1864, from Havana: it was dated " Havana, May 10, 1864." I
</p>
<p>went down to Halifax, and went to a gentleman there by the name
</p>
<p>of Alexander H. Keith, Jr. , and remained under his care until Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn arrived in the steamer "Alphia" on the 12th of July,
</p>
<p>1864. When Dr. Blackburn arrived there, he sent down to the
</p>
<p>hotel where I was staying  the Farmer's Hotel  for me ; and I
</p>
<p>went to see him. He then told me that the goods were on board
</p>
<p>the steamer ''Alphia," and that the second officer on the steamer
</p>
<p>"Alphia" would go with me and get the goods off, as they had been
</p>
<p>smuggled in from Bermuda. I went to see Mr. Hill, the second
</p>
<p>officer, and he told me to get an express-wagon. The proprietor of
</p>
<p>the hotel where I was stopping kept an express-wagon ; and I took
</p>
<p>it down to the steamboat-landing,  it was Cunard's steamboat-
</p>
<p>wharf,  and I there got eight trunks and a valise. He directed me
</p>
<p>to take them to my hotel, and put them in a private room there. I
</p>
<p>got the trunks, took them to the hotel, and put them in a private
</p>
<p>room,  in Mr. Doran's private sitting-room. I then went round
</p>
<p>to Dr. Blackburn, and told him I had got the goods off the
</p>
<p>steamer. He then told me that the five trunks tied up with ropes
</p>
<p>were the ones for me to take ; and he asked me if I would take the

</p>
<p>valise into the States, and send it by express, with an accompanying
</p>
<p>letter, as a donation to President Lincoln. I objected to taking it,
</p>
<p>and refused to do it. I then took three trunks and a valise round
</p>
<p>to his hotel. He was then staying at the Halifax House. The
</p>
<p>412 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>trunks had Spanish marks upon them ; and he told me to scratch or
</p>
<p>scrape them off, and that INIr, Hill would go with me the next
</p>
<p>morning, and make arrangements with some captain of a vessel to
</p>
<p>take them. There were two vessels, two barks, there then, running
</p>
<p>to Boston ; and I was to make an arrangement with either one of
</p>
<p>the two to smuo-orle the trunks into Boston. The next momino:, I
</p>
<p>went down with Mr. Hill, the second officer of the " Alphia," to those
</p>
<p>vessels. I do not know the name of the first vessel to which we
</p>
<p>made application ; but the captain of it was a Captain McGregor.
</p>
<p>What Mr. Hill said to him I cannot say ; it was private conversa-
</p>
<p>tion : but he refused to take the goods. The next that we went to
</p>
<p>was the bark " Halifax," Captain John O'Brien. JVlr. Hill stated to
</p>
<p>Captain O'Brien that I had some goods in the trunks that I wanted
</p>
<p>to take to my friends ; that they consisted of presents that I was
</p>
<p>going to give to my acquaintances,  silks, satin dresses, and so on.
</p>
<p>The captain and ]Mr. Hill had a private conversation together; and,
</p>
<p>when the captain came out, he consented to take them, and I was
</p>
<p>to give him a twenty-dollar gold-piece for smuggling them in. I
</p>
<p>put them on board the vessel that day, and he stowed them away.
</p>
<p>The^ vessel laid five days at Boston before he could get a chance to
</p>
<p>get them off; but he finally succeeded in getting them off the bark
</p>
<p>for me, and expressed them to Philadelphia. I got them at Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, and brought them to Baltimore. I there took out the
</p>
<p>goods, arranged them, bought some new trunks, and brought them
</p>
<p>to this city. I turned over five of the trunks ta Messrs. Wall &
</p>
<p>Co., in this city ; and gave four to a man by the name of Myers, he
</p>
<p>said, from Boston. I understood from him, at the time, that he was a
</p>
<p>sutler in Sigel's or Weitzel's division. He said he had some goods
</p>
<p>that he was going to take to Newbern, in North Carolina ; and, as
</p>
<p>my instructions were to make the best markets I possibly could, I
</p>
<p>told him that I had a lot more of goods that I wanted to sell, audi
</p>
<p>to make the best market I could for them ; and that I would turaj
</p>
<p>over to him, on commission, a lot of goods that I had. I also told]

</p>
<p>him I did not know how quick it would be that I would have more ;
</p>
<p>that Wall & Co. had some. Dr. Blackburn told me at the time,
</p>
<p>that, when I was making arrangements, I should let them know that]
</p>
<p>I would have a big lot of goods to dispose of, as it was in contem-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 413
</p>
<p>plation to get together about a million of dollars' worth of goods in
</p>
<p>the summer, and dispose of them in this way.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he state to you was his object in having these goods
</p>
<p>disposed of in this way in the different cities ?
</p>
<p>A. To destroy the armies ; to destroy anybody  it did not
</p>
<p>matter who  that they came in contact with.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he not state to you that all these goods were carefully
</p>
<p>infected by him with the yellow-fever ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. In Bennuda?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; in Bermuda.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he explain to you the process by which he had infected
</p>
<p>them?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; he did not. He told me that there were other par-
</p>
<p>ties connected with him ; but he did not say who they were. That
</p>
<p>was about infecting other goods with the small-pox and yellow-fever,
</p>
<p>and other diseases, to bring here.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not understand from him that the goods in this valise,
</p>
<p>which was intended to be sent to President Lincoln, had also been
</p>
<p>carefully infected with the fever ?
</p>
<p>A. I understood him to say that they were infected both with
</p>
<p>the yellow-fever and small-pox.
</p>
<p>Q. The goods intended for President Lincoln?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. But you declined taking charge of that valise?
</p>
<p>A. I declined taking charge of it, and turned it over to hun at
</p>
<p>the Hahfax Hotel.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever learn from him afterwards whether he had been
</p>
<p>successful in sending that valise to the President ?
</p>
<p>x\. No, sir ; I did not : but I have heard that it was sent to
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. What disposition did you make of these infected goods which
</p>
<p>you brought to Washington ?

</p>
<p>A. I turned them over to W. L. Wall & Co., auction and com-
</p>
<p>mission merchants, and requested an advance upon the goods. They
</p>
<p>gave me an advance ; and I then left town, and started for Canada.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember the date of that transaction ? 
</p>
<p>35*
</p>
<p>414 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I think it was somewhere about the 5th of August, 1864.
</p>
<p>Q. How many packages did you leave with them ?
</p>
<p>A. Five trunks. There was one of the trunks, a middling-sized
</p>
<p>one, the largest in the lot, that was always spoken of to me by Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn as " big No. 2 ; " and he said I must be sure to have
</p>
<p>that sold here in Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you send any others farther South, or leave them all
</p>
<p>here ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I turned over the rest to this Myers, who was going
</p>
<p>to Norfolk on board a steamboat. I applied for a pass to go there ;
</p>
<p>but General Butler, in answer to my application, stated that the
</p>
<p>army was about to move, under an order from General Grant, I
</p>
<p>believe, changing its position, and no passes could be given to any
</p>
<p>person except those connected with the army.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what occurred on your return to Canada from
</p>
<p>this expedition ?
</p>
<p>A. I went straight through until I got to Hamilton, where I had
</p>
<p>to wait for a change of cars. When I got to Hamilton, I went into
</p>
<p>the waiting-room, and there met Mr. Holcombe and Mr. Clay.
</p>
<p>Q. Clement C. Clay?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; Clement C. Clay. They both rose up and shook
</p>
<p>hands with me, and congratulated me on my safe return and upon
</p>
<p>my making a fortune. They told me I should be a gentleman for
</p>
<p>the future, instead of a mechanic, a working-man. I telegraphed
</p>
<p>at the same time to Dr. Blackburn from Hamilton. He was then
</p>
<p>staying at the Donegana Hotel in Montreal. Mr. Holcombe told
</p>
<p>me that Dr. Blackburn was there, and that I had better telegraph
</p>
<p>to him, stating that I had returned ; and that it was also the request
</p>
<p>of Dr. Blackburn that I should telegraph him as soon as I got in
</p>
<p>Canada. I did so ; and the next night, between eleven and twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock, Dr. Blackburn came up, and knocked at the door of my
</p>
<p>house. I was in bed at the time. I looked out of the window, and
</p>
<p>saw Dr. Blackburn there. Said he, " Come down, Hyams, and

</p>
<p>open the door : you're like all damned rascals who have been doing
</p>
<p>something wrong,  you're afraid the Devil is after you." He was
</p>
<p>in company with Burnett H. Young. I came down, and let him
</p>
<p>in; and he asked me how I had disposed of the goods, and I told
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 415
</p>
<p>him. ** Well," said he, " that is all right as long as ' big No. 2 '
</p>
<p>went into Washington : it will kill them at sixty yards' distance."
</p>
<p>I then told the doctor that every thing had gone wrong at my home
</p>
<p>in my absence ; that I needed some funds ; that my family needed
</p>
<p>money. He said he would go to Colonel Jacob Thompson, and
</p>
<p>make arrangements for me to draw upon him for any amount of
</p>
<p>money I required. He then said that the British authorities had
</p>
<p>solicited his services in attending to the yellow-fever that was then
</p>
<p>raging in Bermuda ; that he was going on there ; and that, as soon
</p>
<p>as he came back, he would see me. I went up to Jacob Thompson
</p>
<p>the next morning, and told him what Dr. Blackburn had said. He
</p>
<p>said, " Yes : Dr. Blackburn had been there, and had made arrange-
</p>
<p>ments for me to draw $100 whenever it was shown that I had made
</p>
<p>disposition of the goods according to his direction." I told him I
</p>
<p>needed some money, and wanted some ; that I had been so long
</p>
<p>away from home, that every thing was gone, and I wanted some money
</p>
<p>to get along, pay rent, &c. Said he, "I will give you $50 now ;
</p>
<p>but it is against Dr. Blackburn's request : when you show me that
</p>
<p>you sold the goods, I will then give you the balance." He
</p>
<p>asked me to give him a receipt; and I gave him a receipt : " Re-
</p>
<p>ceived of Jacob Thompson the sum of $50, on account of Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn."
</p>
<p>Q. When was that ?
</p>
<p>A. That was about the 11th or 12th of August last. The next
</p>
<p>day I wrote a letter to Messrs. Wall & Co., of Washington, stat-
</p>
<p>ing that I had got to Canada, and requesting them, if they had
</p>
<p>sold the goods, to remit the proceeds to me, and an account of the
</p>
<p>sales, in order that I might show Colonel Thompson that I had sold
</p>
<p>them, I received an answer from W. L. Wall, and I took it up
</p>
<p>to Colonel Thompson. He then said he was perfectly satisfied I
</p>
<p>had done my part ; and he then gave me a check for $50 on the
</p>
<p>Ontario Bank, and I had to give him a receipt for it. I gave it

<p>in full, on account of Dr. Luke P. Blackburn."
</p>
<p>Q. Where is he from ?
</p>
<p>A. From Kentucky, originally.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not Jacob Thompson, in all your
</p>
<p>416 THE TRIAL,
</p>
<p>conversations with him, seemed to have a perfect knowledge of the
</p>
<p>character of the goods which you had been selling, and the pur-
</p>
<p>pose for which they were sold ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you understand him fdlly to approve it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he knew all about it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you mention to him the large sum which had been prom-
</p>
<p>ised you by Dr. Blackburn for this service ?
</p>
<p>A. I did ; and Mr. Holcombe told me, as well as Mr. Thomp-
</p>
<p>son, that the Confederate Government had appropriated two hun-
</p>
<p>dred thousand dollars for the carrying of it out.
</p>
<p>Q. For that purpose ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How did he excuse himself for not paying you more ?
</p>
<p>A. Well, sir, it went on. Dr. Blackburn had been to Ber-
</p>
<p>muda, and come back again. I wrote down to him at Montreal,
</p>
<p>and told him I wanted some money, and that he ought to send me
</p>
<p>some. He did not make any reply to my letter. I was then sent
</p>
<p>down to Montreal with a commission from Bennett H. Young, to be
</p>
<p>used in his defence for the St. Albans raid. I there met Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn, and spoke to him ; and he said that I had written some
</p>
<p>hard letters to him, abusing him, and that he had not any money
</p>
<p>to give me. He had a carriage at the door ; and he then got into
</p>
<p>his carriage and rode off to some races, I think, and left me, and
</p>
<p>never gave me any more satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Q. They refused to pay you any more ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state under what name you passed while in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington ? 
</p>
<p>A. J. W. Harris.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you stop in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not stay any time. I think I went to a hotel, and took
</p>
<p>the goods there. I did not know how long I would be detained

<p>here. I registered my name as J. W. Harris. I put up at the
</p>
<p>National Hotel.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you give the precise date ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was on the 5th of August, 1864.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 417
</p>
<p>Q. In what name did you write this letter to Dr. Blackburn ?
</p>
<p>A. In my own name.
</p>
<p>Q. In what name did you write to Wall & Co. ?
</p>
<p>A. J. W. Harris.
</p>
<p>Q The same name that you had assumed before ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether Clement C. Clay and Professor Hol-
</p>
<p>combe, whom you met on your return, in their conversation with
</p>
<p>you, seemed also perfectly to understand the business in which
</p>
<p>you had been engaged ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. They knew it before I had proceeded far oa my
</p>
<p>way. I had gone part of my journey, and returned back to Canada
</p>
<p>for money ; and I met Messrs. Clay and Holcombe, Mr. Preston,
</p>
<p>Mr. McGrregor, Beverly Tucker, Dr. Blackburn, and several other
</p>
<p>gentlemen, at the Clifton House, Niagara Falls.
</p>
<p>Q. They then had knowledge of this business of yours?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And they complimented you, you say, upon your suc-
</p>
<p>cess ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Holcombe and Mr. Cleary did.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that they had this knowledge ? Were
</p>
<p>there any convei*sations between you and them which left no doubt
</p>
<p>on the subject, or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I went to the Clifton House, and intended to return that
</p>
<p>nio;ht back to Toronto, before leavino; for the States ao-ain. Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn had no money with him then, and he told me he would
</p>
<p>go to Holcombe, as he had Confederate funds with him, and get
</p>
<p>the money. He said that Holcombe was going to stay there, and
</p>
<p>that, when I returned, he would either get the money from Holcombe
</p>
<p>or Thompson for the expedition ; that he had to get it either from
</p>
<p>Holcombe or Thompson, and it did not matter which. So I under-
</p>
<p>stood at the time, from that, that Mr. Holcombe knew all about it.
</p>
<p>I never spoke to Mr. Holcombe about it myself; but I inferred

</p>
<p>from him and Mr. Clay shaking hands with me, and congratulating
</p>
<p>me on my safe return at Hamilton, that they must have known all
</p>
<p>about it. I do not know any thing further than that as to whether
</p>
<p>they were acquainted with it or not.
</p>
<p>418 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. You spoke of Dr. Stuart Robinson, a divine from Louisville,
</p>
<p>Ky. , having introduced you to Dr. Blackburn ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did be, or not, seem to have knowledge of the business in
</p>
<p>whicb you were engaged ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not have any knowledge of it from me. I do not
</p>
<p>know what knowledge he had from Dr. Blackburn ; that I cannot
</p>
<p>say : but, for myself, I never told him. He said he did not know
</p>
<p>what business I was going to do, and that he did not want to com-
</p>
<p>mit an overt act ; and I do not know whether he knew any thing
</p>
<p>at all about it. All I know is, that Dr. Bobinson took good care
</p>
<p>of rae while I was there that fall, and until Dr. Blackburn wrote
</p>
<p>for me in the spring.
</p>
<p>Q. He told you that he did not want himself to commit an o\Grt
</p>
<p>act?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he furnish you all the facilities for your seeing Dr.
</p>
<p>Blackburn ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not give me the money. I went and borrowed ten
</p>
<p>dollars from Mr. Preston to go down to Montreal. I gave Mr.
</p>
<p>Preston a receipt for ten dollars on account of Dr. Blackburn. I
</p>
<p>then went down to Montreal, and there saw Mr. Slaughter, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the directions in the letter, and he furnished me with means
</p>
<p>to go to Halifax. At that time, Mr. Slaughter said that he was
</p>
<p>short of funds on account of Johnson & Bros., bankers there,
</p>
<p>breaking and becoming bankrupt; and that he had lost $7,700,
</p>
<p>all the available funds he had ; that he only had $25 that he could
</p>
<p>give me ; and that I had better go to Mr. Holcombe, then staying
</p>
<p>at the Donegana Hotel, and he would furnish me with the balance.
</p>
<p>I went to see Mr. Holcombe at the hotel, and sent my name up to
</p>
<p>him. He had heard of my name, he said ; and he sent for me to
</p>
<p>come up. I then told him that I needed some funds with which
</p>
<p>to go down to Halifax. He asked me how much I wanted. I

<p>told him I wanted as much as would make up $40 ; that I thought
</p>
<p>that would take me through from Montreal. Said he, "You had
</p>
<p>better take $50 ; " but I refused taking it, and said that I did not
</p>
<p>want that much.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 419
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. Before this witness is discharged, I deem it my
</p>
<p>duty to ask whether any allusion is to be made to his testimony in
</p>
<p>summing up against any of the accused.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. You can very well see that the point of
</p>
<p>this testimony is to connect the Rebellion with this crime,  not to
</p>
<p>connect any of these individuals particularly with it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. If it is to affect others, who are not here, and who
</p>
<p>are indicted, I do not wish to make any cross-examination of the
</p>
<p>witness at all ; but, if it is to affect any of the prisoners, I may de-
</p>
<p>sire to do so.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. It may affect, more or
</p>
<p>less, anybody and everybody.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate, You can judge of the effect of it. The
</p>
<p>purpose of its introduction is very obvious.
</p>
<p>W. L. Wall,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not you are a merchant in this
</p>
<p>city ?
</p>
<p>A. I am an auction and commission merchant.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, during last summer, you re-
</p>
<p>ceived on consignment and for sale, from J. W. Plarris, certain
</p>
<p>trunks of goods ?
</p>
<p>A. During last August, while I was out of town, a person named
</p>
<p>Harris called at my store, and told my bookkeeper that he had
</p>
<p>some shirts that he wanted to sell at auction, and asked him if he
</p>
<p>would sell them the next mornino;. Mv clerk told him that he
</p>
<p>would. He then asked him if he would make an advance of $100
</p>
<p>on the shirts. My clerk advanced him the $100, and the shirts
</p>
<p>were sold the next morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see them taken out of the trunks?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see them at all. My clerk is here who received

<p>the shirts and gave the advance.
</p>
<p>420 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>A. Brenner,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you reside in this city.
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you, or not, during the past summer, a clerk in the
</p>
<p>service of Mr. Wall in this city ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, in the month of August last,
</p>
<p>a Mr. J. W. Harris sent to the store of Mr. Wall certain packages
</p>
<p>of goods for sale ?
</p>
<p>A. A man calling himself Harris brought a lot of goods there.
</p>
<p>Q. State all the circumstances.
</p>
<p>A. He came into the store late one evening. I supposed him
</p>
<p>to be a sutler returning home. He asked me to sell some shirts
</p>
<p>for him, and he said that he had twelve dozen. I advanced him
</p>
<p>$100 on them, and sold them the next morning.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they packed in a trunk ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; packed in five trunks. There were some shirts
</p>
<p>and some coats.
</p>
<p>Q. How many dozen ?
</p>
<p>A. He said there were twelve dozen ; but it turned out that
</p>
<p>there was not that number.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you sent him a bill.
</p>
<p>A. I sent him an account of sales and the balance of the
</p>
<p>money.
</p>
<p>Q. You rendered that account of sales to him at what point?
</p>
<p>A. I think, in Toronto, Canada. I have his letter here.
</p>
<p>Q. At what point did he write from to you ?
</p>
<p>A. His letter is dated Toronto, Sept. 1, 1864.

</p>
<p>Q. You may read it if you have it there.
</p>
<p>The witness read the letter, as follows : 
</p>
<p>'^Messrs. Wall ^ Co., Auction and Commission Merchants.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen,  On Friday, the 5th of August, last month, I
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 421
</p>
<p>left in your care five trunks, containing one hundred and fifty fancy
</p>
<p>woollen shirts and twenty-five coats, to be sold at auction on the
</p>
<p>next morning; and, business calling me to Toronto, I have not
</p>
<p>been able to go to the States since. I beg most respectfully that
</p>
<p>you will send me an account of sales, and a check on New York
</p>
<p>for the proceeds. I have written before ; but I have received no
</p>
<p>answer. I shall come over in October, about the 10th, with some
</p>
<p>five or six thousand pairs of boots and shoes.
</p>
<p>" Yours most respectfully,
</p>
<p>"J. W. Harris,
</p>
<p>" Care of Post-office Box No. 126, Toronto, C.W."
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember any thing about these trunks, or the marks
</p>
<p>upon them ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I do not. The shirts were tossed into the trunks
</p>
<p>promiscuously, and I supposed the packing of them was done in a
</p>
<p>hurry.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember whether any of the trunks were marked
</p>
<p>with a big No. 2 ?
</p>
<p>A. We marked them in selling them.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. Was it new clothing, or did it appear to have been worn?
</p>
<p>A. A close inspection showed it to be new clothing,  that it had
</p>
<p>not been worn ; but, when I first opened the trunks, I was in doubt
</p>
<p>about its being a safe investment for the money I had advanced.
</p>
<p>When it was taken out, it was all new : it did not have the appear-
</p>
<p>ance of being worn.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. It had the appearance of having been handled, I suppose ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : it appeared to have been thrown in, and crammed
</p>
<p>down, and rumpled up in that way.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. What amount did these shirts bring?
</p>
<p>A. I brought an account of sales with me, showing the amount,

</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, this last spring, you came up to
</p>
<p>Washington in company with the accused, Dr. Samuel A Mudd.
</p>
<p>A. I did, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State the date of the visit.
</p>
<p>A. It was on the 23d day of March, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did you leave ?
</p>
<p>A. We left here the next day, in the evening.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did you leave your homes to come up here ?
</p>
<p>A. We left on the 23d of March.
</p>
<p>Q. What time of the day ?
</p>
<p>A. It was quite early in the morning, after the usual breakfast
</p>
<p>time,  perhaps eight or nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. State the purpose of the visit.

<p>A. We came up to attend the sale of Government-condemned
</p>
<p>horses, which, we were told, would take place on Friday. When
</p>
<p>we got up to Mr. Martin's, we learned that the day of sale had been
</p>
<p>changed from Friday to Tuesday, and we were disappointed in
</p>
<p>attendinsf the sale.
</p>
<p>Q. Go on, and state where you and Dr. Mudd were during that
</p>
<p>visit.
</p>
<p>A. We got to Mr. Martin's, and heard there that we were disap-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 423
</p>
<p>pointed in the day of sale. Dr. Mudd said he wanted to go over
</p>
<p>in town. We left our horses at Mr. Martin's, and got our dinners
</p>
<p>there. We then walked across the bridge and up to the Navy-
</p>
<p>Yard gate. Then we took a street-car, and came up on the avenue.
</p>
<p>We then went to Mr. Young's carriage-factory, where Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>looked at some wagons.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in the day was this ?
</p>
<p>A. This was getting late in the evening, perhaps about four
</p>
<p>o'clock, perhaps five,  pretty late in the evening. We then went
</p>
<p>round to one or two livery-stables, where Dr. Mudd looked at
</p>
<p>some second-hand wagons. We then went round on the island to
</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander Clark's. We stopped at his dwelling-house : he
</p>
<p>was not at the house, but down at his store near the river. We
</p>
<p>walked down there, and remained there with Mr. Clark until about
</p>
<p>dark ; then Mr. Clark closed up his store, and we returned to his
</p>
<p>dwelling-house with him ; then we got tea ; and, after tea, Mr. Clark,
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd, and myself walked round to Dr. Allen's, who keeps an
</p>
<p>apothecary-shop somewhere in the city, where we remained some
</p>
<p>two or three hours. We then returned to Mr. Clark's, and re-
</p>
<p>mained there all night. The next morning, after breakfast, we went
</p>
<p>down with Mr. Clark to his store, where we remained a few min-
</p>
<p>utes, took leave of Mr. Clark, came up on the avenue, went into
</p>
<p>the Capitol, and looked at some of the paintings. We then took
</p>
<p>a street-car and went down the avenue to Mr. Martin's, where we
</p>
<p>got our horses ; and after dinner we left, and went home. As soon
</p>
<p>as we returned to Mr. Martin's, we ordered our horses to be fed, and
</p>
<p>our dinner ; and after dinner we returned home.
</p>
<p>Q. State with whom you slept that night that you were in the city.
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd and myself slept together. There was but one
</p>
<p>bed in the room, and we occupied that.
</p>
<p>J Q. State whether you and Dr. Mudd were separated for any
</p>
<p>length of time, and if so, for what length of time, during that visit.
</p>
<p>A. We were not separated at all. I am confident that we were

<p>not out of one another's sight from the time we left Mr. Martin's
</p>
<p>until we returned.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or did you not see any thing of Booth on that
</p>
<p>visit ?

<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or did you not go to the National Hotel ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I think we stopped opposite the National Hotel,
</p>
<p>when we looked at some rebel prisoners passing ; but we did not go
</p>
<p>m.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect a contest in your Congressional election
</p>
<p>district in which Calvert was the Union candidate, and Harris the
</p>
<p>secession candidate, or the opposing candidate, for Congress ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I do. Mr. Harris was running as a peace can-
</p>
<p>didate. I do not know that he was termed a " secessionist."
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know as what candidate Calvert was running?
</p>
<p>A. I understood that he was running as the Unconditional
</p>
<p>Union candidate.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know  if so, state  which one of those candidates
</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel Mudd supported for election ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say positively who he supported : I did not see his
</p>
<p>ticket.
</p>
<p>Q. I did not ask you who he voted for; but I asked you who
</p>
<p>he supported in conversation?
</p>
<p>A. From a conversation I had with him, I supposed he would
</p>
<p>support Mr. Calvert. He said he thought it would be better to
</p>
<p>elect Mr. Calvert I understood him so.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you say that Mr. Calvert was reputed to be a better
</p>
<p>Union man than Harris, at the time of that election,, by the neigh-
</p>
<p>bors generally ?
</p>
<p>A. I understood that Mr. Calvert was running as the Union

<p>THE TRIAL. 425
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know that Colonel Holland was a candidate ?
</p>
<p>A. I know that Colonel Holland was a candidate when Harris
</p>
<p>was elected the last time.
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. You do not know that Colonel Holland was the Unconditional
</p>
<p>Union candidate, and the others were both peace candidates ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I do not. I have no knowledge of there being
</p>
<p>three candidates in the field.

<p>John H. Downing,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State where you live.
</p>
<p>A. I live in Charles County, near Mount Pleasant.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you are acquainted with the prisoner, Samuel
</p>
<p>A. Mudd.
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes ! I am very well acquainted with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Daniel J. Thomas ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : both of them were raised right by me.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not the prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd, and
</p>
<p>Daniel J. Thomas, met at your house this last spring ; and if so,
</p>
<p>when?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was some time between the first of March and
</p>
<p>probably the fifteenth that they both met there at my house.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they meet at your house at any other time this spring?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; never.
</p>
<p>Q. Did they come there together ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : Daniel Thomas was at my house about two or three
</p>
<p>hours before Dr. Mudd came there.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did Dr. Mudd stay there ?

<p>A. I think he staid about half an hour.

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you, or were you not, present during the time that Br.
</p>
<p>Mudd was there ?
</p>
<p>A. All the time.
</p>
<p>Q. You were with them all the time ?
</p>
<p>A. I was with them both : Daniel Thomas sat between me and
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd. I was there all the time,  never left the room.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, in conversation at that time,
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd said that Abraham Lincoln was an abolitionist ; that the
</p>
<p>whole Cabinet were such ; that he thought the South would never
</p>
<p>be subjugated under abolition doctrines ; and that all the Cabinet and
</p>
<p>every Union man in the State of Mai-yland, and the President,
</p>
<p>would be killed in six or seven weeks ?
</p>
<p>A. There were no such words spoken in the house, to my
</p>
<p>knowledge ; and I staid there the whole time. Dr. Sam. Mudd was
</p>
<p>not there more than half an hour. He came there to see me, to
</p>
<p>collect a little doctor's bill. I sat there for about half an hour after
</p>
<p>he came ; and I then got up, and walked to the piazza ; and, as I
</p>
<p>walked out, Dr. Mudd got up, and followed me out ; and he then
</p>
<p>told me his business, and went directly home ; and Thomas staid at
</p>
<p>my house, I believe, fully an hour afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd follow you out immediately ?
</p>
<p>A. Immediately after I got up, and before I got to the piazza,
</p>
<p>he was at the door after me.
</p>
<p>Q. Could Dr. Mudd and Thomas have had any conversation
</p>
<p>then at that visit together without your hearing it ?
</p>
<p>A. No ; I do not think they could. Even if they tad whispered,
</p>
<p>I could have heard it, because I was close to them. They had no
</p>
<p>conversation at that time but what I heard : I am certain of that.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any part of the statement which I have recited to you
</p>
<p>made by Dr. Mudd on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. You think you would have noticed it if there had been ?

</p>
<p>A. I should, certainly. The President's name was not mentioned
</p>
<p>during Dr. Mudd's stay at my house. I do not recollect that
</p>
<p>Daniel Thomas ever mentioned his name while he was at my house.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any reference made to any member of the Cabinet ?
</p>
<p>A. No, indeed, sir ; nothing in the world of that kind.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 427
</p>
<p>Q. Was any reference made to killing anybody?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : nothing of the kind was ever mentioned, to my
</p>
<p>knowledge. I never heard a word of the kind mentioned.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not, two or three weeks after that
</p>
<p>occasion, you met Mr. Thomas in the road between your house and
</p>
<p>his house, and he said to you, that, at your house, Dr. Mudd had
</p>
<p>said that the President and the whole Cabinet, and every Union
</p>
<p>man in the State of Maryland, would be killed ?
</p>
<p>A. No, indeed : he never said such a word to me. We met one
</p>
<p>another very frequently, because he attends land right by me ; but I
</p>
<p>never heard a word of that kind mentioned by him in my life.
</p>
<p>Q. Neither before the assassination, nor since the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; neither before nor since. I never heard a word of
</p>
<p>the kind spoken ; and he never said a word of the kind, that I
</p>
<p>recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Did Dr. Mudd say to you, on that occasion, that he did not
</p>
<p>consider the oath of allegiance worth a chew of tobacco ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I recollect. I never heard any thing of the kind
</p>
<p>said, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state what the conversation was about when Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd was there ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot recollect it all. They commenced talking about
</p>
<p>detectives. Daniel Thomas was saying to Dr. Mudd that he was
</p>
<p>appointed a detective ; and he referred to several others,  Jerry
</p>
<p>Mudd, Dr. George Mudd, Joe Padgett, I think, and I think,
</p>
<p>perhaps, one of the Hawkinses,  who, he said, were detectives as
</p>
<p>well as he was ; but he said he never pretended to catch anybody.
</p>
<p>He said he would go to their houses,  it was his duty to go to
</p>
<p>their houses ; but he never would catch anybody. That is exactly
</p>
<p>what he said,  that he was bound to go their houses, but he was
</p>
<p>not bound to catch them.

<p>A. They were talking a good deal.
</p>
<p>Q. Were they talking all that half-hour ?

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I reckon they were.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know that they were talking all the time that Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd was there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I know they were talking.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the whole half-hour consumed with that remark ?
</p>
<p>A. It was pretty much about the detectives.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it all consumed in Thomas making that statement of two
</p>
<p>lines ? Was that all there was of it ?
</p>
<p>A. All that I recollect, or nearly all.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think it took a whole half-hour for Thomas to say
</p>
<p>that he was a detective, and did not catch anybody ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe it did pretty much.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you say that 1
</p>
<p>A. He was telling a whole parcel of foolisb things there.
</p>
<p>Q. You said that was all you minded about any thing connected
</p>
<p>with that talk ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, no ! I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. What did Mudd say ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect now.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you say ?
</p>
<p>A. I had no conversation with them ; none at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Mudd and Thomas were tiilking ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What did Mudd say to Thomas ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe he compared him to a jack ; that was all.
</p>
<p>Q. He said that, did he ?
</p>
<p>A. He did so.
</p>
<p>Q. Did it take him half an hour to say that ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he call him a jack for ?
</p>
<p>A. Because Thomas said he was appointed a deputy provost-
</p>
<p>marshal under Colonel Miller.

</p>
<p>Q. And what did Mudd say to that ?
</p>
<p>A. Mudd said, '* I think, Daniel, I am better educated than you
</p>
<p>are, and I do not think I am capable to fill that office myself, and
</p>
<p>I do not think you are ; " and I believe he got up dii-ectly, and
</p>
<p>compared him to a jack.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 429
</p>
<p>Q. Then what took place next ?
</p>
<p>A. He went and followed me out.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did?
</p>
<p>A. Mudd. I was irritated myself when he called him a jack,
</p>
<p>because it was in my house, and I did not suffer jacks to come into
</p>
<p>my house.
</p>
<p>Q. Was that what you said?
</p>
<p>A. Yes ; and then he got up, and followed me out.
</p>
<p>Q. You went out first ?
</p>
<p>A. I went out first, and Mudd followed ; and then he went off.
</p>
<p>Q. Did it take a whole half-hour for Mudd and Dan. to say that?
</p>
<p>A. I believe it did very near.
</p>
<p>Q. That was all that was said in the half-hour?
</p>
<p>A, That is just about it.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you gone before Mudd went out ?
</p>
<p>A. Not two seconds,  not as long as you could count two.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you go to before Mudd came out?
</p>
<p>A. I went to the door, and Mudd followed me.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you go before Mudd came out ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not go anywhere, only to the door. Mudd followed
</p>
<p>me to the door. We went out of the door into the yard, and had
</p>
<p>some talk there ; and then Mudd went off, and Daniel was in the
</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you at the door before Mudd came ?
</p>
<p>A. Not more than two seconds, I reckon. He followed me
</p>
<p>immediately.
</p>
<p>Q. Mudd staid there half an hour, and then you started for the
</p>
<p>door?
</p>
<p>A. That was at the end of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not say at first that they talked there for half a
</p>
<p>hour?
</p>
<p>A. They were talking there.

</p>
<p>saying that Dan was a jack, and then you broke ?

</p>
<p>A. Then T broke, and went out.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did Thomas call a secesh that time ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not call anybody that, that I heard.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did Mudd say was an abolitionist ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know who : I do not recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you very sure that he did not call Dan. an abolitionist,
</p>
<p>as well as a jack ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I do not recollect that he ever did.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not mind much about that talk ?
</p>
<p>A. No, indeed : I do not recollect.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not Mudd call Dan. an abolitionist right off, and a jack
</p>
<p>too?
</p>
<p>A. Not at that time he did not.
</p>
<p>Q. It was at another time?
</p>
<p>A. He mis;ht have, for all I know.
</p>
<p>Q. He might have done so, for any thing you know ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes : I do not mind all that.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not mind all that talk of half an hour? you do not
</p>
<p>know any thing about it, except that Dan. pretended that he was a
</p>
<p>detective and deputy-provost, and the other insisted that he was a
</p>
<p>jack ?
</p>
<p>A. It was something in that way.
</p>
<p>Q. And they spent half an hour on that ?
</p>
<p>A. Pretty much.
</p>
<p>Q. Did these fellows show any spirit or blood? , Was Mudd
</p>
<p>mad when you ran out of the door ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. '
</p>
<p>Q. Or did he just say it in the best humor in the world to this
</p>
<p>other neighbor of his, that he was a jack ? Was he mad or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I reckon he was then.
</p>
<p>Q. What was he mad about ?
</p>
<p>A. About Dan. being a deputy provost-marshal, I suppose.

</p>
<p>this city.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not, during this past spring, you accompa-
</p>
<p>nied Dr. Mudd up towards Washington.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State when it was, and what was done.
</p>
<p>A. I accompanied him on the 11th of April last to Giesboro' to
</p>
<p>attend a Government sale of horses there.
</p>
<p>Q. Who, if anybody, was in company with him besides your-
</p>
<p>self?
</p>
<p>A. His brother, Henry L. Mudd, Jr. We three were in com-
</p>
<p>pany, no others. We were at the sale some time before the hour.
</p>
<p>I remained there with him till after twelve o'clock, examining horses.
</p>
<p>The horses were of very inferior quality. He made no purchases
</p>
<p>during my stay there. About half-past twelve, having business
</p>
<p>in Washington, I left him, making an engagement with him to meet
</p>
<p>him  the time appointed was three o'clock  at Mr. Martin's,
</p>
<p>near the bridge. I came to Washington, transacted my business
</p>
<p>there, and got back to Mr. Martin's, I think, about half-past two,
</p>
<p>as near as I can recollect, and found Dr. Mudd there waiting for
</p>
<p>me. I remained there probably fifteen minutes r we then rode to-
</p>
<p>gether down towards home : when we got to the road turning to my
</p>
<p>house, I went home, and he continued his journey.
</p>
<p>Q. When you started for Washington, you left him at Gies-
</p>
<p>boro' ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Was his brother there then ?
</p>
<p>A. His brother was with him then.
</p>
<p>Q. Was his brother with him when you returned ?
</p>
<p>A. He was.
</p>
<p>Q. State where this Martin's is.

</p>
<p>A. It is on the corner, right in the forks of the road, not more
</p>
<p>than fifty or a hundred yards from the bridge. One road turns to
</p>
<p>the right, leading to Giesboro', and the other is the stage-road,

</p>
<p>leading down through the counties. Mr. Martin's house is just
</p>
<p>in the forks of these roads.
</p>
<p>Q. That is on the other side of the Eastern Branch ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How far is Martin's from Washington, say from the National
</p>
<p>Hotel?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose it is a mile and a half, or, probably, two miles
</p>
<p>from the National Hotel.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether he made any purchases of horses at
</p>
<p>all on that visit ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any knowledge of Dr. Mudd offering to sell his
</p>
<p>farm ?
</p>
<p>A. I have no knowledge of any direct offer he made of his farm
</p>
<p>for sale.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you knowledge of his expressed purpose in that re-
</p>
<p>spect ?
</p>
<p>A. He spoke, in general terms, of being dissatisfied with the
</p>
<p>place, and that he would like to sell, and that, if he had an advan-
</p>
<p>tageous offer, he would sell.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you hear him speak of that ?
</p>
<p>A. I have heard him speak of that for several years back.
</p>
<p>Q. What place was he referring to ?
</p>
<p>A. The place on which he lives. I say " several years : " I
</p>
<p>suppose I have heard him speak, during the last eighteen months,
</p>
<p>several times on that subject.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you stay at Giesboro' together?
</p>
<p>A. We got there, I think, between eight and nine o'clock in
</p>
<p>the morning ; and I remained there until after twelve.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Dr. Mudd with you all the time ?
</p>
<p>A. He was.

</p>
<p>dinners.

</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness a telegraphic despatch.] Look
</p>
<p>at that paper, and see whether it is the same despatch.
</p>
<p>A. I should say that it was.
</p>
<p>The telegram was read to the Court, as follows : 
</p>
<p>Greensboro', April 19, 1865.
</p>
<p>^^His Excellency President Davis.
</p>
<p>" President Lincoln was assassinated in the theatre in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton on the night of the 11th instant. Seward's house was entered

</p>
<p>aloud, and made this remark : " K it were to be done, it were bet-
</p>
<p>ter it were well done."

<p>Q. You are quite sure those are the words he used?
</p>
<p>A. Those are the words.

<p>Q. State whether or not, within a short time afterwards,  a day
</p>
<p>or two,  Jefferson Davis, John C. Breckinridge, and others were

</p>
<p>Q. And the assassination of the President was a subject of con-
</p>
<p>versation ?
</p>

</p>
<p>their conversation in th6 house at the time.

</p>
<p>A. In speaking of the assassination of President Lincoln, he
</p>
<p>remarked to Davis that he regretted it very much : that it was
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 443
</p>
<p>unfortunate for the people of the South at that time. Davis replied,
</p>
<p>" Well, general, I don't know. If it were to be done at all, it were
</p>
<p>better that it were done : and if the same had been done to Andy
</p>
<p>Johnson the Beast, and to Secretary Stanton, the job would then
</p>
<p>be complete."
</p>
<p>Q. You feel confident that you recall his words, do you?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : those are the words he used.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not the regret which John C. Breckinridge
</p>
<p>expressed at the assassination was because of its criminality, or
</p>
<p>simply because it was unfortunate for the people of the South at
</p>
<p>that time.
</p>
<p>A. I drew that conclusion.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any remark made at all as to the criminality of the act ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. Mr. Breckinridge simply said he regretted it as
</p>
<p>being unfortunate for the South.
</p>
<p>Q. Of what State are you a native ?
</p>
<p>A. Massachusetts.

<p>a witness called for the prosecution, being duly sworn, testified as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In Charlotte, N. C.
</p>
<p>Q. In what business have you been engaged there?
</p>
<p>A. Telegraphic business in connection with the Southern Express-
</p>
<p>Company.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the telegi'aphic despatch referred
</p>
<p>to by L. F. Bates.] Look at that telegraphic despatch of which Mr.
</p>
<p>Bates has just spoken, and state to the Court whether or not it
</p>
<p>passed over the wires at the date indicated.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is a true copy of a message that was transmit-
</p>
<p>ted on the 19th of April, 1865.
</p>
<p>Q. To Davis?

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : to Jeiferson Davis, from Greensboro', signed by
</p>
<p>John C. Breckinridge. The despatch was received by one of my
</p>
<p>operators. I was standing by when it was received.
</p>
<p>444 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it immediately sent to Jefferson Davis in Charlotte ?
</p>
<p>A. When the messao;e was received in Charlotte he was en route
</p>
<p>from Greensboro', or from Concord, where he had stopped the night
</p>
<p>before, to Charlotte. It was delivered to him at Mr. Bates's house
</p>
<p>in Charlotte.
</p>
<p>Q. On that day ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Egbert F. Martin,
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. When you were upon the stand yesterday, you thought that
</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, Henry L. Mudd, Jr., and Dr. Blanford,
</p>
<p>were at your house on the 4th of April last ?
</p>
<p>A. That was a mistake. It was Jerry Mudd, instead of Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd, that was there on that day, as I find on examining my
</p>
<p>register. It was on the 14th of April that Dr. Mudd and his
</p>
<p>brother and Dr. Blanford were there. The reason why I know
</p>
<p>is, because Joshua S. Naylor and Lemuel Orme drove up about
</p>
<p>half an hour, I think, after Dr. Mudd left ; and they asked me if
</p>
<p>there was anybody from the country up, and I told them that Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd and his brother had just left my house, and they registered
</p>
<p>their names.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect seeing Th\ Mudd and Jerry Mudd on their
</p>
<p>way to Washington in December last ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see them on their way, to my knowledge. I saw
</p>
<p>them in market in Washington here on the 24th of December. The
</p>
<p>doctor stood at my stand, and helped me to sell turkeys, while I
</p>
<p>went around the market. He said he thought he could do better
</p>
<p>than I was doing ; the market was rather dull. I left him, and
</p>
<p>went around the market, and came back ; and I do not think he
</p>
<p>had sold one.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was he at your stand in market that day?
</p>
<p>A. I should judge it was from a quarter to half an hour. He

</p>
<p>was there, I think, twice during the day.
</p>
<p>Q. How long at both times ?
</p>
<p>A. The first time he was there he did not stop there long. The
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 445
</p>
<p>second time, lie stopped not over five or ten minutes. He inquired
</p>
<p>of Lucas whether he could carry hira a stove down that he had
</p>
<p>bought at Gregory's, I think he said. Mr. Lucas's reply was, that,
</p>
<p>if he sold his poultry, he would carry it down for him ; if not, he
</p>
<p>would have to take it over to me. However, he did not sell out his
</p>
<p>poultry, and took some of it to my place, and left it for me to sell
</p>
<p>it for him. So the stove was not moved that day, I know, because
</p>
<p>I went down with Lucas to my house.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him between that time, the 24th of December,
</p>
<p>and the 14th of April ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; he stopped at my house on the 23d day of March.
</p>
<p>His name is registered on my book on that day : and he got his
</p>
<p>dinner, and I put his horse away, and kept it until the 24th of
</p>
<p>March, when he came to my house, took dinner, got his horse, and
</p>
<p>started for home.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was with him on that occasion?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Lewellyn Gardiner.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he leave his horse there also ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : both horses were left there.
</p>
<p>Q. What time were the horses left there ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was before dinner.
</p>
<p>Q. What time were they taken away ?
</p>
<p>A. They were taken away after dinner the next day.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where they went ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not. I only know they went across the bridge.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I now propose to ask the witness what statement
</p>
<p>was made by the accused to him as to the purpose of his visit.
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the visit has to be explained, I think, under the rules
</p>
<p>of evidence, that statement is clearly admissible. There are plenty
</p>
<p>of authorities for it.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I undertake to say that
</p>
<p>there is not any authority in the world for it, because that is not in
</p>
<p>issue.

<p>Mr. Ewing. It is in issue whether he met Booth in January.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. Not in March. This is
</p>
<p>in relation to a visit of the 23d of March.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. It is in issue whether Dr. Mudd met Booth in
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 88
</p>
<p>446 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Washington. We are not confined as to any particular day when
</p>
<p>the meeting may have occurred. We want to show that he could
</p>
<p>not have met Booth from the 23d of December down to the time
</p>
<p>of the assassination of the President ; and, in order to show that,
</p>
<p>we prove his presence at home during all that period, except the visit
</p>
<p>to Giesboro', and the one night he went to the party ; and we follow
</p>
<p>it by proof as to what his visits were for, and as to what he did,
</p>
<p>who was with him, and where he went. Now, as a part of the
</p>
<p>proof, to show the purpose of the visits to Washington, his declara-
</p>
<p>tions as to the purpose of the visit made at the time of making the
</p>
<p>visit are admissible under the rules of evidence. I will read to the
</p>
<p>Court an authority on that subject, from 2 Russell on Crimes, p.
</p>
<p>750 : " And, generally speaking, declarations accorxipanying acts
</p>
<p>are admissible in evidence as showing the nature, character, and
</p>
<p>objects of such acts. Thus, where a person enters into land in order
</p>
<p>to take advantage of a forfeiture to foreclose a mortgage, to defeat
</p>
<p>a disseisin, or the like, or changes his actual residence, or is upon a
</p>
<p>journey, or leaves his home, or returns thither, ... his dec-
</p>
<p>larations made at the time of the transaction, and expressive of
</p>
<p>its character, motive, or object, are regarded as verbal acts indicat-
</p>
<p>ing a present purpose and intention, and are therefore admitted in
</p>
<p>proof, like any other material acts."
</p>
<p>The authority is exactly in point. The fact of the journey is
</p>
<p>legitimately given in evidence by us ; and so the object of the jour-
</p>
<p>ney is legitimate : and, in connection with the object of the journey,
</p>
<p>his declarations as to its purpose are admissible.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. The gi-eat trouble is that
</p>
<p>the gentleman does not read enough. I would yield the point if
</p>
<p>he could show in the book from which he has read, or in any other
</p>
<p>book, an authority saying that proof of the kind now offered was
</p>
<p>admissible when the point to which it related was not in issue. The
</p>
<p>rule on the subject is, that, if the prosecution prove the declarations
</p>
<p>and acts of the accused, he may prove all that he said on those
</p>

</p>
<p>occasions, as part of the res gestce ; but there is no such thing in
</p>
<p>the text he read, or in any other, as that a man may prove what he
</p>
<p>said at another time and place not involved in the issue, and about
</p>
<p>which there has been no proof offered by the prosecution. The
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 447
</p>
<p>gentleman says lie wants to prove what the prisoner said as to the
</p>
<p>object of this journey, in order to show that he was not coming to
</p>
<p>see Booth. I suppose if, on the 23d of March, he said he was not
</p>
<p>hunting Booth, and they prove that ; and if, when he got back home,
</p>
<p>he said he did not see Booth, and they prove that, it would be proof
</p>
<p>of that fact ! What authority is there for saying that that can be
</p>
<p>done ? There is no book in the world that says so : the text read
</p>
<p>by the gentleman does not mean any such thing. If the gentleman
</p>
<p>can show me a text which says that a defendant may prove an act
</p>
<p>that has not been put in issue by the accusation, about which no
</p>
<p>proof has been offered by the prosecution, and prove all he said on
</p>
<p>that occasion, I shall yield. The same book from which the gentle-
</p>
<p>man read lays down the law that the party shall upt introduce his
</p>
<p>own declarations on his own motion. The text is (p. 750) : " Hear-
</p>
<p>say evidence of a fact is not admissible ; " and it goes on to say,
</p>
<p>*' There are, however, certain instances which it will be the object of
</p>
<p>this section to point out, where hearsay evidence is admissible : "
</p>
<p>but when? "When hearsay is introduced, not as a medium of
</p>
<p>proof in order to establish a distinct fact, but as being in itself a
</p>
<p>part of the transaction in question."
</p>
<p>Now, is this transaction in question ? How is the fact whether
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd came to Washington on the 23d of March or not, in
</p>
<p>question ? Is it so on the charge and specification ? Not at all.
</p>
<p>Is it so by any proof offered by the prosecution ? Not at all. Our
</p>
<p>proof is, that in January he was here, and had an interview with
</p>
<p>Booth ; and he is not to disprove that by his mere declarations ; and
</p>
<p>this testimony is offered for no other purpose whatever. It is not to
</p>
<p>explain any transaction, because there is no transaction calling for
</p>
<p>explanation. The fact that he came here on the 23d of March is
</p>
<p>not in evidence against him,  it is not a matter of accusation
</p>
<p>against him,  it is not in question : and therefore I say the declara-
</p>
<p>tions of that date, proposed to be offered in evidence, are his
</p>
<p>declarations, offered in evidence on his own motion, for no purpose

</p>
<p>except to disprove the testimony offered against him by the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion,  that he had an interview with Booth in January ; and there
</p>
<p>is no text of any law-book anywhere that says he can make evidence
</p>
<p>in that way by his own declarations.

<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Ewing.] State how far from the bridge your
</p>
<p>hotel is.
</p>
<p>A. It is about a hundred yards from the hotel to the Navy- Yard
</p>
<p>Brido;e, the Eastern Branch Bridge.
</p>
<p>Q. Do persons going to Bryantown from "Washington pass by
</p>
<p>your hotel ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have a post-office there. The Leonardtown stage
</p>
<p>leaves the mail there, going and coming, morning and afternoon.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether, upon any other time since the 24th of Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, you have seen Dr. Mudd going to, or returning from, Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, or about your hotel, except those two times that you
</p>
<p>speak of.
</p>
<p>A. I have never seen him. I am not home much myself. I
</p>
<p>attend market pretty regular.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever known of his being there at any other time ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not. I never kept any record of persons
</p>
<p>stopping there until the 20th of February. I cannot recollect
</p>
<p>them all. There were a good many persons there from different
</p>
<p>counties.
</p>
<p>Q. If he had stopped there at any other time but those two, you
</p>
<p>would have recollected it ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose I would ; I do not know : I cannot say positively
</p>
<p>whether I did or not. Those are the only times I recollect of ever
</p>
<p>seeing him. I do not recollect him stopping there on the 24th of
</p>
<p>December. I saw him in market, though.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Who are the two persons that you say called at your place,
</p>
<p>and asked if there was anybody there from Charles County?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Joshua S. Naylor and Lemuel Orme.
</p>
<p>Q. What day was that ?
</p>
<p>A. I can tell positively by the register. It was on the 11th day

<p>of April.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Dr. Mudd was there when Joshua S.
</p>
<p>Naylor or Lemuel Orme came there ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.- 449
</p>
<p>A. I tliink not. They were just from Upper Marlboro', and
</p>
<p>went the other road. They went from my house, and drove right
</p>
<p>over to the cars, taking their horses back.
</p>
<p>Q. Bid they say for what purpose they wanted to see him ?
</p>
<p>A. They did not say they wanted to see anybody in particular.
</p>
<p>They were only inquiring whether anybody was up from the
</p>
<p>county.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing stated that Jeremiah Dyer, one of the witnesses
</p>
<p>heretofore called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, desired the
</p>
<p>privilege of correcting his testimony in one particular.
</p>
<p>The Commission consented that the correction should be made.
</p>
<p>Jeremiah Dyer
</p>
<p>recalled.
</p>
<p>The "Witness. I find in one place in my testimony a mistake.
</p>
<p>If I so stated, I certainly did not mean it. The statement is, that
</p>
<p>I had never crossed the Potomac since the war. I meant to say
</p>
<p>that I had never crossed the Potomac since the fall of 1861. I
</p>
<p>was speaking of these parties in the pines. I accompanied those
</p>
<p>parties to Virginia on that occasion. I remained there four or five
</p>
<p>weeks, and then returned. I went there to avoid arrest. I thought
</p>
<p>the question had been asked, or it was understood, in speaking of
</p>
<p>those parties being together, that I had accompanied them. I
</p>
<p>understood it was stated that Gwynn had gone there, and, of
</p>
<p>course, I was with him, and accompanied him to Richmond. In
</p>
<p>speaking of crossing the .Potomac, my reference was to the time
</p>
<p>since the fall of 1861.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you any further correction you wish to make ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What part of Virginia did you accompany them to ?
</p>
<p>A. We went to Richmond.
</p>
<p>Q. What time in 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. In September, I think.

<p>450 THE TRIAL,
</p>
<p>Q. That was after the Rebellioii broke out?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Some time in September ?
</p>
<p>A. In September.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you stay in Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. I staid in Richmond, I suppose, about four weeks. I was
</p>
<p>sick there for two weeks. From there I came to Fredericksburg ;
</p>
<p>remained there about a week, and then came home.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Jefferson Davis when you were there ?
</p>
<p>A. I did see him once or twice passing along.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have an interview with him when there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never spoke to him in my life.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you meet with any of the officers of the rebel organiza-
</p>
<p>tion, civil or military, there ?
</p>
<p>A. None except Mr. Taylor, who, I think, was in the "War De-
</p>
<p>partment there, from whom I got a pass, thi'ough the influence of
</p>
<p>some friends, to cross the river.
</p>
<p>Q. What business took you and these men to Richmond ?
</p>
<p>A. To avoid arrest, as we supposed we were going to be ar-
</p>
<p>rested..
</p>
<p>Q. And you thought it was best to fall into the hands of the
</p>
<p>enemy V
</p>
<p>A. I do not know what I thought at the time. I regretted it
</p>
<p>very much after it was done.
</p>
<p>Q. You say you staid with them in the pines. Do you mean in
</p>
<p>Virginia ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where then ?
</p>
<p>A. In Maryland, near Dr. Mudd's house.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you go to the pines ?
</p>
<p>A. We were there a few days during the week. We were there
</p>
<p>some four or five days before we left there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you sleep in the pines at night ?.

</p>
<p>Q. Who fed you?
</p>
<p>A. Dr. Mudd.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not belong to an organization (I do not care whether
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 451
</p>
<p>it was secret or public) hostile to the Government of your coun-
</p>
<p>try?
</p>
<p>A. I belonged to a cavalry company, as I stated before.
</p>
<p>Q. I ask you whether it was not hostile to the Government and
</p>
<p>Administration of the United States ?
</p>
<p>A. In its organization it was not.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not in fact ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say that it was in fact.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it not, at the time that you belonged to it ?
</p>
<p>A. It would probably depend on circumstances. I suppose if
</p>
<p>Maryland had passed an ordinance of secession, in all probability
</p>
<p>that company would have been in the rebel array.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not that organization in favor of sustaining Maryland in
</p>
<p>so doing?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Q. Did not its members encourage the passage of such an ordi-
</p>
<p>nance ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that they did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not publicly proclaim yourself in favor of the seces-
</p>
<p>sion of Maryland ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware of. I may have done it; I do not
</p>
<p>recollect: it has been four years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been over the lines since that ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been at Dr. Mudd's since ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, su\

<p>Q. When?

<p>A. I was at his house last Christmas.

</p>
<p>A. . Yes, sir : I have been there several times.

</p>
<p>A. During the last summer.

<p>A. I do, certainly, whenever I go to the county. I have two
</p>
<p>or three sisters there, and I go to see them all.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether, while you were in Virginia, you entered into
</p>
<p>the Confederate service.
</p>
<p>A. I did not. I did not go there with that intention.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether, when you returned, you took the oath of
</p>
<p>allegiance.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you have kept that oath of allegiance since.
</p>
<p>A. I have never violated it to my knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Q. Have you done any act in aid or encouragement of the
</p>
<p>Rebellion since?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I am aware of.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you endeavored to obey the laws, and sustain the
</p>
<p>Government since ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not violated any law that I am aware of.

</p>
<p>A. I took it after my return from Virginia. I do not recollect
</p>
<p>the exact time ; some weeks or so afterwai'ds.
</p>
<p>Q. In what year ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 453
</p>
<p>A. 1861, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know that that was the time ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was ; I am not positive : I know it was some short
</p>
<p>time after I returned.
</p>
<p>Q. Who administered the oath of allegiance to you ?
</p>
<p>A. I think one of the lieutenants or captains down at General
</p>
<p>Hooker's camp.
</p>
<p>Q. By what order was the oath of allegiance required in 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A, When we returned home, we were advised to report to the
</p>
<p>authorities ; and I got a letter of introduction from Judge Crane to
</p>
<p>one of the commanding officers,  I do not recollect his name.
</p>
<p>When I started to go to see him, I found that he had left the place
</p>
<p>where he had been stationed. I think he was then at Chapel's
</p>
<p>Point, or somewhere along there. In a week or ten days after that,
</p>
<p>I went down to General Hooker's camp.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was that ?
</p>
<p>A. At Budd's Ferry ; and took the oath there.
</p>
<p>Q. Who administered the oath ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know who it was,  a lieutenant or a captain.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether it was in 1861 at all or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was in 1861.
</p>
<p>Q. What month ?
</p>
<p>A. November or December, I think it was : I do not recollect
</p>
<p>exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you say that was ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was at Budd's Ferry, down on the Potomac, 
</p>
<p>somewhere there. I think his camp was at Budd's Ferry.

<p>Q. State whether or not he has ever said any thing to you, and
</p>
<p>if so, when, about offering his laud for sale.
</p>
<p>454 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I have heard him on several occasions within the last two
</p>
<p>years state that he wanted to sell out.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at church on the Sunday after the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What church?
</p>
<p>A. The church in the neighborhood called Rives's Church.
</p>
<p>Q. How far from Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. Five or six miles, I think.
</p>
<p>Q, That was on Easter Sunday?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; the Sunday after the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether the fact of the assassination of the
</p>
<p>President was then known ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think it was generally known.
</p>
<p>Q. And talked of after church ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether or not the name of the assassin was
</p>
<p>generally understood ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I think not. My impression is that it was not.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether you saw Dr. Mudd there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you heard Dr. Mudd say any thing as to how
</p>
<p>he reojarded the act of assassination.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. That I object to. That
</p>
<p>is the old question over again, of introducing Dr. Mudd's declara-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I have brought that before the Court again for the
</p>
<p>purpose of doing what I failed to do yesterday,  calling the atten-
</p>
<p>tion of the Court specially to the character of the declarations that
</p>
<p>I expect to prove.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. I believe it is the rule
</p>
<p>of all military courts, when stating what you expect to prove, that
</p>
<p>the witness himself should withdraw, so that he may not be instruct-
</p>
<p>ed by those remarks.

</p>
<p>The witness retired from the stand and the court-room.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I expect simply to prove that Dr. Mudd spoke of
</p>
<p>the assassination as an atrocious and revolting crime, and a terrible
</p>
<p>calamity to the country ; that he spoke of it generally among his
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 455
</p>
<p>neighbors at the church in that way. I again call the attention of
</p>
<p>the Court to the principle upon which I claim that it is applica-
</p>
<p>ble ; and that is, that Dr. Mudd is charged with concealment of
</p>
<p>the fact of those men having been there,  a concealment extend-
</p>
<p>ing through Sunday,  - and that his declarations showing his feeling
</p>
<p>with reference to the crime during the time that they allege him to
</p>
<p>have been acting as accessory to it are admissible.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection of the Judge Advocate.
</p>
<p>Joshua S. Naylor,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. I reside in the Eighth Election District, Prince George's
</p>
<p>County, Md.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state whether you knew Daniel J. Thomas?
</p>
<p>A. I knew him very well.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether you knew Daniel J.
</p>
<p>Thomas's general reputation for truth and veracity in his neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood, and what that reputation is, if you know it ?
</p>
<p>A. I knew his general character pretty well from report, and
</p>
<p>also from observation.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his general character ?
</p>
<p>A. His general character is bad.
</p>
<p>Q. From his general character for truth and veracity,  we are
</p>
<p>only speaking of his general character for truth and veracity, 
</p>
<p>would you believe him on his oath ?
</p>
<p>A. From my own knowledge of the man, I could not.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you known Thomas ?
</p>
<p>A. All the time since he was a small boy.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you did or did not know his character for truth
</p>
<p>and veracity before this war.
</p>
<p>A. I have known him all the time, and never heard him spoken

<p>very well of any of the time.
</p>
<p>456 TUE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court what is his reputation in his
</p>
<p>neighborhood for truth and veracity ?
</p>
<p>A. His reputation is that he never tells the truth if a lie will
</p>
<p>answer his purpose better.
</p>
<p>Q. From that general reputation, would you or would you not
</p>
<p>believe him on his oath ?
</p>
<p>A. It is a hard thing to say of a man, but I could not.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever know of Mr. Thomas speaking falsely under
</p>
<p>oath?
</p>
<p>A. Not under oath : I never heard him sworn.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear it charged upon him that he had ever
</p>
<p>sworn falsely ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I ever did.
</p>
<p>Q. The reputation of which you speak is, that he talks idly and
</p>
<p>extravagantly and fooUshly and unreliably, but that reputation does
</p>
<p>not extend to any statements which he would make under oath.
</p>
<p>Am I right in that ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard that he was charged with swearing falsely.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he not reputed to be an honest man in his neighborhood,
</p>
<p>and a loyal one ?
</p>
<p>A. He is sometimes one thing and sometimes the other, just as
</p>
<p>the prospects of the different parties seem to be going.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been loyal yourself throughout the Ptebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I can prove that without any difficulty.
</p>
<p>Q. I do not ask you for the proof; I ask you for the fact. -
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I have.
</p>
<p>Q. You have constantly desired that the Grovernment should
</p>
<p>succeed in suppressing the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. Always.
</p>
<p>Q. Has not Mr. Thomas, within your knowledge, been an open,
</p>
<p>out-spoken advocate of the Government throughout the Rebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. During the latter part of the Rebellion, he has been pre-

</p>
<p>tending to be a pretty warm supporter of the Grovernment, and
</p>
<p>perhaps he might have been sincere.
</p>
<p>Q. What grounds have you for suspecting his sincerity ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 457
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Adams, a neighbor of mine, told me 
</p>
<p>Q. Never mind what Mr. Adams told you. Have you any
</p>
<p>grounds within your own knowledge for suspecting the sinceiity of
</p>
<p>his loyalty ?
</p>
<p>A. Only from what I have heard that he had told other persons
</p>
<p>in the early part of the RebelUon. I do not know that I had any
</p>
<p>conversation with him about the matter in the early part of the war.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you entirely friendly with Mr. Thomas?
</p>
<p>'^ A. Perfectly so.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever known of Mr. Thomas being sworn in any
</p>
<p>case ?
</p>
<p>A. I have never heard an oath administered to him.
</p>
<p>Q. You have never known of his giving testimony in any case
</p>
<p>in the courts ?
</p>
<p>A. I have never been in court when he was testifying in any
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>Q. Therefore you cannot say as to what his reputation for ve-
</p>
<p>racity when he is under oath is ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot : I have no means of judging whether he told the
</p>
<p>truth or not : I never heard him examined.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been an active supporter of the Government of
</p>
<p>the United States?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I have.
</p>
<p>Q. And supported the Administration?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. At all times ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And under all cu'cumstances ?
</p>
<p>A. At all times and under all circumstances.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the reputation in the community in which he
</p>
<p>lives for loyalty of Dr. George Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I have heard Dr. George Mudd spoken of as a good Union

</p>
<p>man. I have no personal knowledge of his Union proclivities.
</p>
<p>Q. Are you personally acquainted with Dr. George Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. Not particularly so. I have seen Dr. Mudd in Bryantown
</p>
<p>VOL, II. 39
</p>
<p>458 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>on a few occasions, but not since 1862 or 1863, or probably 1859
</p>
<p>or 1860.
</p>
<p>Q. How far do you live from Bryantown ?
</p>
<p>A. Seven or eight miles.
</p>
<p>Q. You say that Dr. Greorge Mudd is reported to be a loyal
</p>
<p>man ?
</p>
<p>A. He is, sir : I have never heard it doubted.
</p>
<p>Q. And a supporter of the Grovernment in the war against the
</p>
<p>Eebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I think he is. He has always spoken against the
</p>
<p>Kebellion ; that is, I understand so from report. I have never
</p>
<p>heard him speak about it.
</p>
<p>Q. He has been a supporter of the Government in its efforts to
</p>
<p>suppress the E,ebellion ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have always understood that he was in favor of
</p>
<p>supporting the Grovernment.
</p>
<p>By the Couht :
</p>
<p>Q. How far do you live from Mr. Thomas?
</p>
<p>A. When he resided at his mother's, I suppose he lived about
</p>
<p>two miles from me ; and sometimes he lives on a farm nearer, within
</p>
<p>a mile and a half.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever had any private difference with him?
</p>
<p>A. Never in my life ; only I would get tired of his talks some-
</p>
<p>times, and would tell hun to stop talking ; I did not care to hear
</p>
<p>so much.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever had any differences of a political character
</p>
<p>when he was a candidate for the House of Delegates of Maryland ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe he was runnino- as a Union candidate in Charles
</p>
<p>County ; but I had nothing to do with him. I live in Prince
</p>
<p>Greorge's County.
</p>
<p>Q. There were no differences between you and him growing out
</p>
<p>of that?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.

<p>William A. Mudd,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd, being duly

<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 459
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q, Do you know Dr. Samuel A. Mudd ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q. How far do you live from liim ?
</p>
<p>A. I judge it is about a mile and a quarter, or between that and
</p>
<p>a mile and a half.
</p>
<p>Q. Will you state to the Court whether, at any time last year,
</p>
<p>you saw a Captain White, of Tennessee, or a Captain Perry, or a
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Perry, at or about Dr. Samuel A. Mudd's house or
</p>
<p>premises ?
</p>
<p>A. I never did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Andrew Gwynn, or Ben. Gwynn, or George
</p>
<p>Gwynn, about his house, or about his premises, at any time last
</p>
<p>year ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I have not seen Andrew Gywnn since he left for
</p>
<p>the South. Mr. George Gwynn I have seen about church several
</p>
<p>times since his return.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see any person staying out in the woods at Dr.
</p>
<p>Samuel Mudd's at any time last year ?
</p>
<p>A. I never did, I never saw a man there that I knew or heard
</p>
<p>had been South except one, and he I only heard went there. I do
</p>
<p>not know whether he did or not.
</p>
<p>Q. You need not state what you heard : I only ask you as to
</p>
<p>what you saw.
</p>
<p>A. I saw Mr. Bennett Gwynn sitting there on his horse, as I was
</p>
<p>passing one day, talking with the doctor. I rode up in front of the
</p>
<p>house. I do not recollect what the conversation was; but they
</p>
<p>were talking, and talking loud. I understood from him, I think, or
</p>
<p>some one, that he was scouting. That has been, I think, some-
</p>
<p>thing near three years ago.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it quite three years ago ? Do you remember whether it
</p>
<p>was the first year of the war ?
</p>
<p>A. I think it was somewhere in the fall of the first year of the

</p>
<p>It was the time I understood they were after him to catch him.

</p>
<p>of the Government not known at the time that witness was exam-
</p>
<p>ined, and he proposed now to recall that witness for the purpose of
</p>
<p>examining him in relation to the accused, Edward Spangler ; and
</p>
<p>he applied to the Commission for permission to re-examine that wit-
</p>
<p>ness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. As counsel for Spangler, I have no objection.

</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether you were a carpenter in Ford's
</p>
<p>Theatre down to the 14th of April last.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I was.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you there on the night of the 14th of April, when the
</p>
<p>President was shot?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. State which box in the theatre the President occupied that
</p>
<p>night.
</p>
<p>A. It was on the left-hand side of the stage : on the right as you
</p>
<p>come in from the front.
</p>
<p>Q. Did the President sit in the upper, or lower box ?
</p>
<p>A. The upper.
</p>
<p>Q. When the shot was fired, did you hear anybody say any thing
</p>
<p>about stopping a man ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What was said ?
</p>
<p>A. Somebody hallooed, *' Stop that man ! "
</p>
<p>Q. State where you were at the time, and what you did when you
</p>
<p>heard that cry, " Stop that man! "
</p>
<p>A. I was standing on the stage behind the scenes. Some one
</p>
<p>cried that the President was shot. Then I saw a man running that
</p>
<p>had no hat on.
</p>
<p>Q. 'Which way was he running ?

</p>
<p>A. Towards the back door. He had a knife in his hand, and I
</p>
<p>ran to stop him, and ran through the last entrance ; and as I came
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 461
</p>
<p>up to him he tore the door open. I made for him, and he struck
</p>
<p>at me with the knife ; and I jumped back then. He then ran out,
</p>
<p>and slammed the door shut. I then went to get the door open
</p>
<p>quick, and I thought it was a kind of fast : I could not get it open.
</p>
<p>In a moment afterwards, I opened the door, and the man had just
</p>
<p>got on his horse, and was running down the alley ; and then I came
</p>
<p>in. I came back on the stage where I had left Edward Spangler,
</p>
<p>and he hit me on the face with the back of his hand, and he said,
</p>
<p>" Don't say which way he went." I asked him what he meant by
</p>
<p>slapping me in the mouth ; and he said, " For God's sake, shut
</p>
<p>up ! " and that was the last he said.
</p>
<p>Q. Is the Edward Spangler to whom you refer the prisoner at
</p>
<p>the bar ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. i
</p>
<p>Q. When you went out of that door, had anybody else except
</p>
<p>the man that ran with the knife gone out before you ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not see any one else.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any go out after you ?
</p>
<p>A. Some one came out, but I do not know who it was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you leave the door open when you went out?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I left it open.
</p>
<p>Q. What do you do during the time the play is going on in the
</p>
<p>theatre, if any thing ?
</p>
<p>A. My business is to shift wings on the stage, and pull them off,
</p>
<p>and fetch things out of the cellar if they need any thing.
</p>
<p>Q. State what sort of a man, if any, came out after you had
</p>
<p>gone out of the door.
</p>
<p>A. I thought it was a tall man, and a pretty stout man.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know him ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I did not take notice who it was.
</p>
<p>Q. When you came back into the theatre was the door open, or
</p>
<p>shut ?

<p>462 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was Spangler then ?
</p>
<p>A. He was at the same place, just about ready to shove off the
</p>
<p>scenes ; and I was standing there, and listening to the play.
</p>
<p>Q. Which was nearest the door, you or Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. You are certain you both stood there together when the pistol
</p>
<p>was fired ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When the pistol was fired, did you know what had hap-
</p>
<p>pened ?
</p>
<p>A. Not right away. First some one hallooed, " Stop that man ! "
</p>
<p>and then after that some one said the President was shot ; and it
</p>
<p>was only then that I knew what had happened.
</p>
<p>Q. You did not know what had happened until the President
</p>
<p>was shot?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. When you came back, whereabout was Spangler?
</p>
<p>A. At the place where I left him ; the same place.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there a crowd in there then?
</p>
<p>A, The actors were there, and some strangers.
</p>
<p>Q. Who were there right by you ?
</p>
<p>A. There were some women standing there ; I do not know who
</p>
<p>they were,  some that belonged to the theatre ; but I do not know
</p>
<p>their names.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you not know one of them ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know any of their names. I am not acquainted
</p>
<p>with them. I had been there only about four weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. Did any one of them take part in the play that night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I think some did.
</p>
<p>Q. WTiat parts did those take who were standing there when
</p>
<p>Spangler slapped you ?
</p>
<p>A. The one they used to call Jenny was standing there then. I
</p>
<p>do not know what part she took.

</p>
<p>Q. How close was she standing to you and Spangler when he
</p>
<p>struck you?
</p>
<p>A. She might have been three or four feet from me.
</p>
<p>Q. She probably heard him say that ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL, 463
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.
</p>
<p>Q. He said it loud enough for her to hear ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not say it so very loud.
</p>
<p>Q. He said it in the usual tone ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes ; but he looked as if he was scared, and a kind of cry-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not hear the people then hallooing '* Burn the
</p>
<p>theatre"?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I just heard them hallo " Hang him," and *' Shoot
</p>
<p>him," That was all I heard.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you afterwards tell to a number of persons what Spangler
</p>
<p>said to you when he slapped you ?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of. I think some detective came and asked
</p>
<p>something about the theatre, and I told him about Spangler hitting
</p>
<p>me in the mouth with his open hand.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. John T. Ford ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you tell either of the Messrs. Ford?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. I never knew John T. Ford until I saw him after
</p>
<p>the thing happened.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say nothing to any of the Fords about what Spangler
</p>
<p>had said to you when he slapped you ?
</p>
<p>A. I told it to nobody but Gifford, the boss.
</p>
<p>Q. You told Gifford ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you tell Gifford ?
</p>
<p>A. At the prison.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you tell Gifford that Spangler had said ?
</p>
<p>A. I told him that Spangler said I should not say which way the
</p>
<p>man went.
</p>
<p>Q. When was it that you told Gifford?
</p>
<p>A. It was the same week I was released, I think.
</p>
<p>Q. At Carroll Prison?

</p>
<p>464 ' THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.
</p>
<p>Q. To what detective did you tell it ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know his name. It is the man that had me arrested.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you tell it to him ?
</p>
<p>A. After I was released from the prison.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you tell him ?
</p>
<p>A. At the house where I board. He came up there the same
</p>
<p>day, I think ; it was on Friday, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it after you were released ?
</p>
<p>A. In the afternoon : I was released at eleven o'clock ; and
</p>
<p>in the afternoon he came there, about three or four o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of looking man was the detective?
</p>
<p>A. He has black whiskers and mustache.
</p>
<p>Q. How heavy a man ?
</p>
<p>A. About one hundred and forty pounds, I should think.
</p>
<p>Q. How was he dressed ?
</p>
<p>A. In black. He is one of Colonel Baker's men.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know what they call that detective ?
</p>
<p>A. No : I do not know his name.
</p>
<p>Q. You told it to nobody else, then, but to Gifford and that
</p>
<p>detective ?
</p>
<p>A. That is all, as far as I can remember.
</p>
<p>Q. See if you cannot recollect somebody else to whom you told
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>A. I may have said something in the house at the table when I
</p>
<p>came in there. I think the rest of them heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Where were you ?
</p>
<p>A. At the boarding-house where I generally board.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at a meal when he came in ?

</p>
<p>came.
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him shut it?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; but I did not know who he was then : I did not
</p>
<p>Bee his face right.
</p>
<p>Q. You wore the next person who got to the door after he left ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 465
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Then who opened it?
</p>
<p>A. I opened it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you shut it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How close to you was the big man who ran out after you?
</p>
<p>A, He might have been perhaps five or six yards from me when
</p>
<p>I heard him holla, " Which way? " I do not know, I cannot- say
</p>
<p>for certain, whether it was he or some one else who hollaed " Which
</p>
<p>way? " I cried out, " This way ; " and then ran out, and left the
</p>
<p>door open. By that time, the man had got on the horse, and gone
</p>
<p>off down the alley.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you see the big man again ?
</p>
<p>A. Outside.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen that big man since ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not take notice what kind of a lookins: man he
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>Q. He is a good deal taller man than you are ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he not considerably over six feet high?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say whether he was over six feet ; but he was a tol-
</p>
<p>erably tall man.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was it after you went out before you came back to
</p>
<p>where Spangler was standing ?
</p>
<p>A. It might have been two or three minutes.
</p>
<p>Q. And he was crying, you say ?
</p>
<p>A. He looked the same as if he was crying, and a kind of
</p>
<p>scared,
</p>
<p>Q. What did you say to him first, before he said that to you?
</p>
<p>A. I did not say any thing to him.
</p>
<p>Q. What else did you hear the people holla?
</p>
<p>A. " Hang him ! " " Shoot him ! " was all I heard them holla.
</p>
<p>That was the last.

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>

<p>466 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Wlien did you find tliat it was Booth who had shot the
</p>
<p>pistol ?
</p>
<p>A. After the people were all out and I came outside. Some
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. It was after Spangler had slapped you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear them talk about burning the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You and Spangler were standing where you were for the
</p>
<p>purpose of shifting the scenes ?
</p>
<p>A. It was not my place to shove them : my work is generally
</p>
<p>to pull off the things, and shove them on.
</p>
<p>Q. But that was Spangler's place ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sirj and some other man's, whose name I do not
</p>
<p>know.
</p>
<p>Q. Spangler was there, then, where he ought to be to do the
</p>
<p>work that he had to do ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How many persons were inside the theatre about the door
</p>
<p>when you came back ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot tell how many ; there were a good many. They
</p>
<p>were still running down from up stairs asking which way the man
</p>
<p>went ; and I told them he had gone out the back way.
</p>
<p>Q. That was after you saw Spangler the second time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; that was afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. You are certain Booth opened the door himself and shut it,
</p>
<p>and that then you were the next person who opened it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And you left the door open ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And that big man was the next one who followed you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at supper with Spangler that night?

<p>Francis S. Walsh,
</p>
<p>a witness for the accused, David E. Herold, being duly sworn, tes
</p>
<p>tified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In the city of Washington, on Eighth Street, east.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you resided there ?
</p>
<p>A. Since 1837.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, David E. Herold ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you known him ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot tell how long I have known him, but since he was
</p>
<p>a boy. I have known him for a great many years. I have known
</p>
<p>him intimately since October, 1863.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not he has been in your em-
</p>
<p>ploy.

</p>
<p>Q. What is your business ?
</p>
<p>A. Druggist.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court, as near as you can, his character.
</p>
<p>A. While he was in my employ, he lived in my house, and I
</p>
<p>knew of nothing objectionable in his character. He was like most
</p>
<p>youngsters, light, trifling in a great many things ; but, as to his
</p>
<p>moral character, I never saw any thing to find fault with. He was
</p>
<p>temperate in his habits, and regular in his hours.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he or not, in his general character, more of a boy than
</p>
<p>a man ?
</p>
<p>*~ A. I think he was.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he or not easily persuaded or influenced by any one
</p>
<p>around him ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think he was.

</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether you did or did not consider him
</p>
<p>rather remarkable for his trivial character, easily to be influenced
</p>
<p>and led away.
</p>
<p>468 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. Yes : I think he was more than usually so for young men of
</p>
<p>his years.
</p>
<p>Q. He was boyish in every respect?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. What do you suppose to be Herold's age ?
</p>
<p>A. I should suppose him to be about twenty-two years old.
</p>
<p>James Nokes,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, David E. Herold, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Stone :
</p>
<p>Q. Where do you reside ?
</p>
<p>A. In that part of Washington called the Navy Yard,  the
</p>
<p>Sixth Ward.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you resided there ?
</p>
<p>A. Since 1827.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, David E. Herold ?
</p>
<p>A. I do.
</p>
<p>Q, How long have you known him?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him from his bii'th,  about twenty-tkree
</p>
<p>years, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen a good deal of him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir, I have. I have been intimate with his family for
</p>
<p>eighteen or nineteen years.
</p>
<p>Q. How large is the family?
</p>
<p>A. I think there are seven or eight children,  seven, I believe,
</p>
<p>living. He is the only boy.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court what is his general character for boyish-
</p>
<p>ness. Is he easily persuaded or led away ? Is he trivial ? Is he
</p>
<p>more of the boy now than the man ?
</p>
<p>A. I have always looked upon him as a light and trifling boy, 
</p>
<p>very little reliability to be placed in him.
</p>
<p>Q. Is he or is he not easily influenced by any one around him?

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 469
</p>
<p>Q. Is he not more easily influenced in that way than the gener-
</p>
<p>ality of young men of his age ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I am certain he is.
</p>
<p>Q. Easily impressed by any one with whom he associated and
</p>
<p>who had fascinating qualities ?
</p>
<p>A. I have never heard him enter into any argument, like other
</p>
<p>young men, on any subject in the world. All the conversation I
</p>
<p>ever heard him make use of was light and trifling.
</p>
<p>William H. Keilotz,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, David E. Herold, being duly
</p>

</p>
<p>A. Going on thirteen years.

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I know him well.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you known him all that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Perhaps the first few months I lived there I was not ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with him, but have been for I suppose nearly thirteen
</p>
<p>years this fall.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him pretty generally during the month of Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary last ?
</p>
<p>A. I think I did.
</p>
<p>Q. State how often you saw him.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot positively say how often. I was home, my wife
</p>
<p>beino; sick. I came out sometimes in the mornino; and afternoon.
</p>
<p>The yards are low, and from our windows we can see over into
</p>
<p>each other's yards. I saw him once in a while : I cannot tell the
</p>
<p>particular times, only it was pretty often.
</p>
<p>Q. State, as near as you can, how long you were without seeing
</p>
<p>him during the month of February last.

<p>470 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether he is or is not a boyish character,
</p>
<p>easily persuaded.
</p>
<p>A. I think he is. He is very fond of boys' company. I see
</p>
<p>him very often with boys.
</p>
<p>Q. Is not his character light and trivial? Is he not easily per-
</p>
<p>suaded and influenced?
</p>
<p>A. With boys in that way he is led off. He is very fond of
</p>
<p>sport, gunning, dogs, &c.
</p>
<p>Q. More of the boy than the man about him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. He never associates with men, but with boys of
</p>
<p>eighteen or twenty or twenty-two, generally speaking.

<p>well known to me, and it is to very many of the officers of the army,
</p>
<p>that the person who is introduced upon the stand as a witness, Ed"
</p>
<p>ward Johnson, was educated at the National Military Academy at
</p>
<p>the Government expense, and that, since that time, for years, he held
</p>
<p>a commission in the army of the United States. It is well known in
</p>
<p>the army that it is a condition precedent to receiving a commission,
</p>
<p>that the officer shall take the oath of allegiance and fidelity to the
</p>
<p>Government. In 1861 it became my duty as an officer to fire upon
</p>
<p>a rebel party, of which this man was a member, and that party fired
</p>
<p>upon, struck down, and killed loyal men that were in the service of
</p>
<p>the Government, Since that time, it is notorious to all the officers
</p>
<p>of the army, that the man who is introduced here as a witness has
</p>
<p>openly borne arms against the States, except when he has been a
</p>
<p>prisoner in the hands of the Government. I understand that he is
</p>
<p>brought here now as a witness to testify before this Court ; and he
</p>
<p>comes here as a witness with his hands red with the blood of his
</p>
<p>loyal countrymen, shed by him or by his assistance, in violation of
</p>
<p>his solemn oath as a man and his faith as an officer. I submit to
</p>
<p>this Court that he stands, in the eye of the law, as an incompetent
</p>
<p>witness, because he is notoriously infamous. To ofter as a witness a

<p>man who stands with this character, who has openly violated the
</p>
<p>obligation of his oath, and his faith as an officer, and to administer
</p>
<p>472 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>the oath to him and present his testimony, is but an insult to the
</p>
<p>Court and an outrage upon the administration of justice. I move
</p>
<p>that this man, Edward Johnson, be ejected from the Court as an
</p>
<p>incompetent witness on account of his notorious infamy on the
</p>
<p>grounds I have stated.
</p>
<p>General Ekin. I rise, sir, to second the motion, and I am glad
</p>
<p>that the question is now presented to the Court. I regard the gen-
</p>
<p>tleman as clearly incompetent. Of all men in this country, for
</p>
<p>those who have been educated by the Government, who have been
</p>
<p>nourished by the Government, and protected by the Government, to
</p>
<p>come into a court of justice, present themselves before a military
</p>
<p>commission with such a character as we are here required to pass
</p>
<p>upon, I regard as the height of impertinence ; and I trust that the
</p>
<p>resolution which has been presented will be adopted by this Com-
</p>
<p>mission without a moment's hesitation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. Before the Commission decides upon the motion of
</p>
<p>the honorable member of the Court [General Howe], it may be
</p>
<p>proper for me to say that I was not aware that the fact that a person's
</p>
<p>having borne arms against the United States disqualilied him, or
</p>
<p>rendered it incompetent for him, to become a witness in a court of
</p>
<p>justice ; and, therefore, it cannot be cliarged upon me that I de-
</p>
<p>signed any insult to the Court in introducing General Johnson as a
</p>
<p>witness here. It will be recollected, however, that Mr, Jett, who
</p>
<p>has also borne arms against the Government, was introduced here
</p>
<p>as an important witness by the prosecution ; and he, according to
</p>
<p>his own statement, had never taken the oath of allegiance ; and his
</p>
<p>testimony at that time was not objected to.
</p>
<p>General Kautz. This is not a volunteer witness, is he ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. No, sir.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. If it please the Court, I feel called upon
</p>
<p>to state that the rule of law on this point is, that, before a witness
</p>
<p>can be rendered so infamous as to become absolutely incompetent tc
</p>
<p>testify, he must have been convicted by a judicial proceeding, and

</p>
<p>the record of his conviction must be presented as the basis of hi^
</p>
<p>rejection. All evidences of his guilt that fall short of that convi^-
</p>
<p>tion affect only his credibility. This Court can discredit him jui.
</p>
<p>as far as they please upon that ground ; but I do not think the rule
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL, 473
</p>
<p>of law, as now understood, would authorize the Court to declare
</p>
<p>him an incompetent witness, and incapable of testifying, however
</p>
<p>unworthy of credit he may be.
</p>
<p>The President. The gentlemen of the Commission will vote on
</p>
<p>the question whether the motion of General Howe shall be sus-
</p>
<p>tained.
</p>
<p>General Wallace, For the sake of the character of this inves-
</p>
<p>tigation, for the sake of public justice,  not for the sake of the
</p>
<p>person introduced as a witness, but for the persons who are at the
</p>
<p>bar on trial,  I ask the general who makes the motion to withdraw
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>General Howe. On the statement of the Judge Advocate
</p>
<p>General that this witness is technically and legally a competent
</p>
<p>witness, I withdraw the objection.
</p>
<p>The President. The witness will now be sworn.
</p>
<p>Edward Johnson,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Mary E. Surratt, being duly sworn,
</p>
<p>testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Aiken :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court your full name.
</p>
<p>A. Edward Johnson.
</p>
<p>Q. Also state your present status as a prisoner of war.
</p>
<p>A. I am a United-States prisoner of war, captured at Nashville,
</p>
<p>about the 15th. of December last, and now confined at Fort Warren,
</p>
<p>Boston Harbor.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you, or were you not, an officer in the so-called Con-
</p>
<p>federate service ? and if so, of what rank ?
</p>
<p>A. I was an officer of the rank of major-general in the Confed-
</p>
<p>erate-States army ; was so from the year 1863 up to the date of my
</p>
<p>capture. I think Februaiy, 1863, my commission bears date.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a higher rank after that?
</p>
<p>A. I did not. I will state that I bore the rank of brigadier-
</p>
<p>general previously to that.

<p>Q. Are you acquainted with Henry von Steinacker?
</p>
<p>474 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I am acquainted with a man wlio went by that name,^
</p>
<p>represented himself to me as Henry von Steinacker.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a member of your staff?
</p>
<p>A. He was not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he rank as an engineer-officer, or receive the pay of
</p>
<p>such?
</p>
<p>A. He did not rank as an officer. He was a private on engineer
</p>
<p>duty, but not an officer, either of the engineers, of the staff, or of
</p>
<p>the line.
</p>
<p>Q. What regiment and company did he belong to ?
</p>
<p>A. He belono;ed to the Stonewall Brio-ade, Second Virginia In-
</p>
<p>fantry, t think, although I am not positive on that point. What
</p>
<p>company I do not remember.
</p>
<p>Q. Was the Second Virginia Eegiment attached to your division ?
</p>
<p>A. It was in the Stonewall Brigade, and that was one of the
</p>
<p>brigades of my division.
</p>
<p>Q. Please state to the Court how, when, and under what cu'cum-
</p>
<p>stances. Von Steinacker presented himself to you.
</p>
<p>A. In the month of May, 1863, a man accosted me in Richmond,
</p>
<p>on the Capitol Square, by my name and rank, and with the rank
</p>
<p>that I had borne in the United-States army, as 3Iajor Johnson. He
</p>
<p>told me that he had served under me as a private in the permanent
</p>
<p>company.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to any talk
</p>
<p>between this witness and Von Steinacker in Richmond.
</p>
<p>The Witness. This man met me in Richmond, and applied to
</p>
<p>me for a position in the engineer corps, stating that he had served
</p>
<p>with me previously, and that he was a Prussian by birth, an engi-
</p>
<p>neer by education, and would like to get into the engineer corps of
</p>
<p>our service. I declined giving him a position. It was not in my
</p>
<p>power to give him a position, and he left me that evening. He
</p>
<p>called again, made a second application for a position, which I could
</p>
<p>not give. I was then ordered off to my division at Fredericksburg ;

</p>
<p>and, about a week after I arrived there, this man appeared in my
</p>
<p>camp again, made personal apphcation to me for a position, either
</p>
<p>in the engineer corps or on my staff. I told him that I could not
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 475
</p>
<p>give him a position in either ; but that, if he would enlist himself
</p>
<p>as a private, from what he had represented himself as being, an
</p>
<p>engineer and draughtsman, I would put him on duty as a private,
</p>
<p>but under an engineer-officer of my staff. On these conditions he
</p>
<p>enlisted as a private in the Stonewall Brigade, in the Second Regi-
</p>
<p>ment Virginia Infantry, I think, but I am not positive as to the
</p>
<p>regiment. After he enlisted, I attached him to the headquarters,
</p>
<p>and assigned him to special duty with my engineer-officer. Captain
</p>
<p>Oscar Heinrichs ; and he acted as draughtsman and assistant to
</p>
<p>the engineer-officer from that time forward until he left, or I was told
</p>
<p>he had left.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he the subject of a court-niiartial at any time in your
</p>
<p>camp ? and if so, for what ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to that. In
</p>
<p>the first place, the record of such a court-martial, if it were here,
</p>
<p>would not import any verity. If it would amount to any thing, the
</p>
<p>record would be the only competent evidence of the conviction.
</p>
<p>If the gentleman wants to discredit a man for infamy by reason of
</p>
<p>conviction, he must produce the record ; and when the record is
</p>
<p>produced, it must be the record of a court that imports verity. I
</p>
<p>do not think there were any courts in Virginia in those days that
</p>
<p>could try a dog.
</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken. Under the circumstances, parole testimony of this
</p>
<p>fact is the best that can be offered ; and therefore I presume it
</p>
<p>will not be seriously objected to. I insist upon the question.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Whereabouts in Virginia was your en-
</p>
<p>campment soon after the battle of Gettysburg ?
</p>
<p>A. It was near Orange Court House, in Orange County, Va.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know or not of a meeting of the officers of the
</p>
<p>Stonewall Brigade at the camp of the Second Virginia Regiment 'i
</p>
<p>A. I know nothing of it, and never heard any thing of the
</p>
<p>kind.

<p>was held there at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard of any secret meeting.

<p>476 ' THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever, at any meeting of the officers of your divi-
</p>
<p>sion, hear discussed plans for the assassination of the President of
</p>
<p>the United States ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard any such plans discussed in any meetings of
</p>
<p>the officers, nor did I ever hear the assassination of the President
</p>
<p>alluded to by any individual officer of my division as an object to
</p>
<p>be desired.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you acquainted with J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I was not, and never saw him.
</p>
<p>Q. [Submitting to the witness the photograph of J. Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, marked Exhibit No. 1.] Look at that picture, and say
</p>
<p>whether you ever saw the man it represents or not.
</p>
<p>A. I never saw him, to my knowledge. I have seen the pic-
</p>
<p>ture before, but I never saw the man. In fact, I did not know
</p>
<p>there was such a man ; and I never heard of him until the assassi-
</p>
<p>nation of President Lincoln.
</p>
<p>Q, Did you ever see J. Wilkes Booth in your camp ?
</p>
<p>A. Never. I never saw a man of that name, to my recollec-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you personal knowledge of Lieutenant David Cocker-
</p>
<p>ill losing a horse ?
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham objected to the question
</p>
<p>as irrelevant, and it was waived.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Did you, while at the South, ever learn
</p>
<p>any thing of secret associations by the name of Knights of the
</p>
<p>Golden Circle, or Sons of Liberty ?
</p>
<p>A. I never heard of them personally ; never heard of them in

<p>the South at all ; never saw any member belonging to them, or
</p>
<p>reputed to belong to them.
</p>
<p>Q. While in Richmond did you ever hear it freely spoken of in

</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I never heard it spoken of as a desirable object.
</p>
<p>In fact, as I said before, I never heard any officer or any person
</p>
<p>speak of or allude to the assassination of the President as a desir-
</p>
<p>able object, to the best of my recollection. In fact, I am confident
</p>
<p>I never heard any thing of the kind.

<p>Q. Was Von Steinacker a member of General Blenker's staff?
</p>
<p>A. Not that I know of.

<p>Q. Did he state to you that he was a member of General Blenk-
</p>
<p>er's staff?
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he state to you that he was a deserter from our service ?

<p>desert, and had been apprehended.

<p>Q. Had you been in the service of the United States?

<p>Q. Were you a graduate of the West-Point Military Academy ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long had you been in the army of the United States ?

<p>A. I graduated in 1838.

<p>cate Bingham, that the statement to be made by him would not af-
</p>
<p>fect the evidence heretofore given by Henry von Steinacker.
</p>
<p>The witness, H. K. Douglass, then proceeded to say,

<p>wish to say that I do not believe that they knew any thing about it,

</p>
<p>I know of the others having been.

<p>Q. Have you ever heard declarations made in Richmond to the
</p>
<p>effect that President Lincoln ought to be assassinated ?
</p>

</p>
<p>tbat the accused, Mary E. Sun-att, had, a few days before the

<p>declarations.

</p>
<p>Q. That you would look at the papers ?

<p>THE TRIAL. 491
</p>
<p>Q. Did you say you would send to hell any man from that
</p>
<p>neighborhood who would testify against your sister ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you use any threats against him in case he appeared as
</p>
<p>a witness against her here ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Nothing of the kind ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not any thing like that.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you did say upon that subject.
</p>
<p>A. I forget how the conversation commenced. I told him that
</p>
<p>I understood he was a witness ; and that I understood he was a
</p>
<p>strong witness against my sister, which he ought to be, I told him,
</p>
<p>for she had raised his family of children. This is about as much
</p>
<p>as I recollect saying to him.
</p>
<p>Q. You stated to him that you understood he was a strong wit-
</p>
<p>ness against your sister ?
</p>

</p>
<p>Q. And that he ought to be, for she had supported his family ?

</p>
<p>Q. That was the reason why he ought to be a strong witness
</p>
<p>against your sister ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that the way you wish to be understood by the Court ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. That is as near as I can come to it.
</p>
<p>Q. That because your sister had raised his family and support-
</p>
<p>ed them, therefore he ouglit to be a strong witness against your
</p>
<p>sister ?
</p>
<p>A. I think that is as near as I can come to it.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that all you can think of?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you call him a liar during that conversation ?
</p>
<p>A. I disremember.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any angry or excited conversation between you ?

<p>A. He did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he mention, in connection with the paper he exhibited

</p>
<p>A. He told me so hhnself.
</p>
<p>Q. When did you go in there to the hotel ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know ; I judge about ten o'clock. I Went in with
</p>
<p>Cottingham and Joshua Lloyd.
</p>
<p>Q. I understand you, then, to say that you used no threat of
</p>
<p>any character against him ?
</p>
<p>A. Except looking at his statement in the public press. That
</p>
<p>was all, to my knowledge.

<p>you not ?

</p>
<p>press ; that is all I said, to the best of my knowledge.

<p>Q. And then, if you found in the public press that he had tes-
</p>
<p>tified against your sister, what did you say you would do with

</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>Gwynn there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long were you at the Lloyd House, then?
</p>
<p>A. I judge it was about two o'clock when I got there,  be-
</p>
<p>tween two and three ; and I staid till about sundown, probably a
</p>
<p>little after sundown.

</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not for some time past.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you often plagued her about getting spectacles ?

</p>
<p>him the same as she would for my brother.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time, according to the best of your recollection ?
</p>
<p>The Witness. The last time Atzerodt was there, Weichmann
</p>
<p>engaged the room for him, and asked ma to allow him to stay there
</p>
<p>all night. They were sitting in the parlor, and made several signs
</p>
<p>over to each other. Weichmann and he then left the room, and
</p>
<p>presently Weichmann came back, and asked ma if she would have
</p>
<p>any objections to Atzerodt remaining there that night ; that he did
</p>
<p>not feel at home at a hotel. After thinking for some time, ma said,
</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Weichmann, I have no objections."

</p>
<p>Q. How long was that, according to the best of your recollection,

<p>before the assassination 'i
</p>
<p>A. I do not know ; not a very long time after Christmas.
</p>
<p>Q. How many times did he come there? How much did he
</p>
<p>stay there ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Payne, or whatever his name is, staid there one night
</p>
<p>the first night he came. I did not see him any more for some
</p>
<p>weeks after,  I could not state the number,  when he came one
</p>
<p>night when we were all in the parlor. Weichraann went to the
</p>
<p>door and brouo-ht the gentleman in, and I recoo-nized him as the
</p>
<p>one who had been there before under the name of Wood. I did
</p>
<p>not know him by the name of Payne at all. I went down stairs to
</p>
<p>tell ma that he was there. She was in the dining-room. She said
</p>
<p>she did not understand why strange persons should call there ; but
</p>
<p>she supposed their object was to see my brother, and she would
</p>
<p>treat them politely, as she was always in the habit of treating every
</p>
<p>one. He called two or three times after that ; perhaps the same
</p>
<p>week, or two weeks after : I cannot say exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ask for accommodations that night ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. We were sitting in the parlor, and he said, ** Mrs.
</p>
<p>Surratt, if you have no objections, I will stay here to-night ; I
</p>
<p>intend to leave in the morning;" and I believe he did, at that
</p>
<p>time, leave the next mornino^.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you acquainted with J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have met him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you recollect the last time he was at your house ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; he was there on Friday or Monday  I do not
</p>
<p>know which day it was. I did not see him. I heard he had been
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. Did your mother go to Surrattsville that day?
</p>
<p>A. She went there on Friday, the day of the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. Was her carriage ordered, or not, and at the door to go to

</p>
<p>as ma was ready to start and the buggy was at the door. I had

<p>to o-o on business in reo-ard to some land.

<p>he came.

<p>A. Yes, sir : it was mine, given to me by that man Weichmann.
</p>
<p>Q. Was any other picture ever attached to it ?
</p>
<p>A. I put one of J. Wilkes Booth behind it.
</p>
<p>Q. What was your object in doing that ?
</p>
<p>A. I went one day with Miss Honora Fitzpatrick to a daguer-
</p>
<p>rean gallery to get her picture (she had had it taken previously) , and
</p>
<p>we saw some of Mr. Booth's there ; and having met him before,
</p>
<p>and being acquainted with him, we got two of the pictures and took
</p>
<p>them home. When my brother saw them, he told me to tear them
</p>
<p>up and throw them in the fire ; and that, if I did not, he would take
</p>
<p>them from me ; and I hid them.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you own any photographs or lithographs of the leaders
</p>
<p>of the Bebellion,  Davis, Stephens, and others ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Davis, Stephens, Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson,
</p>
<p>and perhaps a few others.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you get these ?
</p>
<p>A. My father gave them to me before his death ; and I prized
</p>
<p>them on his account, if on nobody else's.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you own any photographs in the house at that time, of
</p>
<p>Union generals ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Who were they?
</p>
<p>A. General McClellan, General Grant, and General Joe Hooker.

<p>500 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was tliat before the assassination of President
</p>
<p>Lincoln ?
</p>
<p>A. The Monday after, in the evening or night, would be two
</p>
<p>weeks.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you ever seen him since ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I have never seen him since.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he on friendly terms with J. Wilkes Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. He may have been. Mr. Booth called to see him some-
</p>
<p>times. I never asked him what his friendship was to Booth. One
</p>
<p>day, when we were sitting in the parlor, Booth came up the steps,
</p>
<p>and my brother said he beheved that man was cra2y, and he wished
</p>
<p>he would attend to his own business and let him stay at home.
</p>
<p>He told me not to leave the parlor ; but I did it.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. Miss Surratt, you ought
</p>
<p>to be cautioned here, and the counsel also, that the statements or
</p>
<p>conversations of Mr. Surratt or Mr. Booth or your mother are not
</p>
<p>competent testimony. You should state- simply what was done, and
</p>
<p>not give the statements of the parties ; and the counsel ought not
</p>
<p>to ask for such statements.
</p>
<p>3Ir. Aiken. [To the witness.] In giving your evidence, you
</p>
<p>wiU avoid giving statements that you heard your brother make,
</p>
<p>and the language he used. State only what you know, as far as
</p>
<p>your knowledge goes.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Aiken.] Where was John H. Surratt, your
</p>
<p>brother, in 1861 ?
</p>
<p>A. He was at college.
</p>
<p>Q. At what college ?
</p>
<p>A. At St. Charles College, near EUicott's Mills, Md.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he a student there at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; but not a student of divinity.
</p>
<p>Q. He was not a student of divinity.
</p>
<p>A. Xo, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long was your brother at that college?

<p>Q. During the time he was not spending his vacations at home,
</p>
<p>he was at the college ?

</p>
<p>Q. Did you at any time, at your mother's house, on any occa-
</p>

</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever hear any remarks made with reference to the
</p>
<p>assassination of any member of the Government ?

</p>
<p>A. I have known him ever since he was a boy.
</p>
<p>502 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you at the house of Mr. Hezekiah Metz on the Sun-
</p>
<p>day morning following the assassination of the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Atzerodt, there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a conversation with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. I had some conversation with him.
</p>
<p>Q. State what that conversation was.
</p>
<p>A. I met with Mr. Atzerodt at Mr. Metz's, I suppose between
</p>
<p>eleven and twelve o'clock on the sabbath after this aflfair had oc-
</p>
<p>curred; and, as I approached Mr. Atzerodt, I said to him, "Are
</p>
<p>you the man that killed Abe Lincoln ? " I said it in a joke.
</p>
<p>Said he, " Yes," and laughed. Said I, "Well, Andrew,"  he
</p>
<p>went by the name of Andrew there, his christened name,  "I
</p>
<p>want to know the truth of it ; is it so ? There is an excitement
</p>
<p>in the neio-hborhood on account of hearins: this?"
</p>
<p>Q. Is what so ? Did you ask him ?
</p>
<p>A. Was the President assassinated? and he said, "Yes, it is
</p>
<p>so : he died yesterday evening about three o'clock." That was
</p>
<p>about all that was said about the President. I went on then ask-
</p>
<p>ing him whether it was so about Mr. Seward and his sons being
</p>
<p>stabbed. We had heard that Mr. Seward's throat was cut, and
</p>
<p>that two of his sons were stabbed ; and I asked him the question
</p>
<p>whether it was really so or not. Said he, " Yes : Mr. Seward was
</p>
<p>stabbed, or rather cut at the throat, but not killed ; 'and two of his
</p>
<p>sons were stabbed. Then I asked him whether the news was cor-
</p>
<p>rect about General Grant. We had heard that General Grant was
</p>
<p>assassinated at the same time on the same night. He said, " No :
</p>
<p>I do not know whether that is so or not. I do not suppose it is so.
</p>
<p>If it had been so, I would have heard it." That passed off then,
</p>
<p>and dinner was called for. We went in to dinner ; and, while we
</p>
<p>were sitting at the dinner-table, my brother asked him the question
</p>
<p>again whether General Grant was killed or not ; and he said, "No:

</p>
<p>I do not suppose he was. If he was killed, he must have been
</p>
<p>killed by a man that got on the same train or the same car" 
</p>
<p>I do not remember which of the two  " that he did." That was
</p>
<p>about the amount of the conversation as it passed him and me or in
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 603
</p>
<p>my presence. I was not in his company more than half an hour, I
</p>
<p>suppose, at the outside.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you at any time during that day hear him say, that, if
</p>
<p>the man followed Greneral Grant who was to have followed him, he
</p>
<p>would have been killed ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I did not hear him say so.
</p>
<p>Q. You understood him to say that anybody who wanted to kill
</p>
<p>General Grant must have got on the same car with him ?
</p>
<p>A. I will repeat the words : he said, " If General Grant was
</p>
<p>killed, it must have been by a man that got on the same car or the
</p>
<p>same train "  I do not remember which one of the two words he
</p>
<p>made use of  " that General Grant got on." That was about the
</p>
<p>conversation as I heard it.
</p>
<p>Q. Was or was not the prisoner during that day excited ? Did
</p>
<p>he seem to be in an excited condition ?
</p>
<p>A. I thought he was confused, or rather appeared so at the din-
</p>
<p>ner-table. There was one thing that I supposed confused the man :
</p>
<p>I did not dream of such a thing as that he would have a hand
</p>
<p>in 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. You need not state
</p>
<p>what you dreamed.
</p>
<p>The Witness. I was going to say this : that the young lady

<p>to whom he has been paying his addresses

</p>
<p>your suppositions.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. Nor any thing about
</p>
<p>his courtship.

<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. State what took place

<p>there simply.

<p>By Mr. Doster :

<p>Q. Was he or was he not paying his addresses to the daughter
</p>
<p>of Mr. Metz?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he had been.

<p>Q. Was she or was she not showing him the cold shoulder on
</p>
<p>that day ?
</p>
<p>A. It appeared so in my presence.
</p>
<p>504 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. And he was down in the mouth, as they say, in conse-
</p>
<p>quence ?
</p>
<p>A. I think so. AVhether that was it, or any thing else, I cannot
</p>
<p>say, I am sure.
</p>
<p>Q. What was the general reputation of the prisoner in that
</p>
<p>neighborhood, as regards character ?
</p>
<p>A. He was a man who was visitino- among the neio-hhors there ;
</p>
<p>visiting respectable people in the neighborhood,  Mr. Nichols and
</p>
<p>others, who were respectable people there. I do not know any
</p>
<p>thin or more about him, because I have not been in the neiohborhood
</p>
<p>a great while, and he has been out of it for some time. His father
</p>
<p>settled there when quite a boy, and then moved away ; and I had
</p>
<p>not seen him for several years previous to the last year or two.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you with the prisoner all the time that he was talking
</p>
<p>with Mr. Metz during that day ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I was not.
</p>
<p>Q. But at the dinner-table he could not have made any remark
</p>
<p>to Mr. Metz without your hearing it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir; I suppose not. My brother was sitting between
</p>
<p>jyir. Atzerodt and myself.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Burxett :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have any other talk with Atzerodt on that day ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you walk with him from the house down to the stable ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : that was my brother.

</p>
<p>day succeeding the assassination ?
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 505
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I was.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you have a conversation there with the prisoner Atze-
</p>
<p>rodt?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. You joined in a conversation that was held there in which
</p>
<p>the prisoner took part ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State what that conversation was, as near as you can re-
</p>
<p>member.
</p>
<p>A. I broached the subject about General Grrant being assassi-
</p>
<p>nated ; and I asked him the question whether it was so or not. He
</p>
<p>said he did not suppose it was so ; and he then said, "If it is so,
</p>
<p>some one must have got on the same train of cars that he did."
</p>
<p>That was all the conversation that I had with him, with the excep-
</p>
<p>tion, that, when he and I were out in the yard, he said 
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. That is unnecessary : you need not state what he
</p>
<p>said in the yard.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. Go on and state what he said to you in the yard.
</p>
<p>A. He said. Oh, my ! what a trouble I see ! " I said to him,
</p>
<p>" Whj, what have you to trouble you ? " Said he, " More than I
</p>
<p>will ever get shut of."
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. That was immediately after you had been speaking of the
</p>
<p>assassination, was it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; some time afterwards. I took it for gi-anted 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. You need not state
</p>
<p>what you took for granted ; give the words, and nothing else.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. What more did he say?
</p>
<p>A. That was about all he said at that time.

<p>A. lie had been paying his addresses to Mr. Metz's daughter ;
</p>
<p>but she had sort of slighted him in some way : I do not know
</p>
<p>what.
</p>
<p>Q. She had shghted him on that Sunday ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And she had shghted him just before he went out in the
</p>
<p>yard, and told you that he had more trouble than he could ever get
</p>
<p>shut of?
</p>
<p>A. It was about that time : I cannot say that it was that time
</p>
<p>exactly.

</p>
<p>A. Yes, su*.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you known him ?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him since March.
</p>
<p>Q. Of this year ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not the prisoner at the bar, Atzerodt, called
</p>
<p>at your house on the evening of the 14th of April.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he called on the evening of the 14th of April, at
</p>
<p>about ten o'clock. He rode up to the door, and .called the black
</p>
<p>boy out to hold his horse.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know precisely what time it was ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not exactly : somewhere in the neighborhood of
</p>
<p>ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice whether he was excited or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not : I did not take particular notice of him.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know any thing about his reputation for courage ?
</p>

<p>not think we are going to try his character for courage.

</p>
<p>this man is a constitutional coward ; that, if he had been assigned
</p>
<p>the duty of assassinating the Vice-President, he never could have
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 507
</p>
<p>done it ; and that, from liis known cowardice, Booth probably did
</p>
<p>not assign him to any such duty. Certainly it is just as relevant
</p>
<p>as any thing can be.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. If the counsel wishes
</p>
<p>to prove that the prisoner Atzerodt is a coward, I will withdraw
</p>
<p>my objection.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Boster.] What do you know of the prisoner
</p>
<p>Atzerodt being a coward or a brave man ?
</p>
<p>A. Nothing but what I have heard from other persons.
</p>
<p>Q. What have you heard ? What do you know of his general
</p>
<p>reputation of being a coward ?
</p>
<p>K. I have heard men say that he would not resent an insult.
</p>
<p>That is about all I know about it.

<p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner Atzerodt ?

<p>A. Six or seven years.
</p>
<p>Q. Bid you or not know him at Port Tobacco ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What is his reputation there for bravery ?
</p>
<p>A. He was always called a man of not much courage.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he or was he not considered remarkable for cowardice ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir; he was.
</p>
<p>Q. Bid you ever hear anybody make any special remark in ref-
</p>
<p>erence to his cowardice ?

<p>A. No, sir ; I cannot say that I ever did.

</p>
<p>608 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I am one of the proprietors.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you, or not, seen the prisoner, Atzerodt, before ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him at the stables once. That is the man [pointing
</p>
<p>to the prisoner, George A. Atzerodt].
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you let Atzerodt have a horse on the
</p>
<p>14th of last April out of your stable.
</p>
<p>A. I did.
</p>
<p>Q. Describe that horse.
</p>
<p>A. It was a small bay mare, about sixteen and a half hands high.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time did he get the horse ?
</p>
<p>A. To the best of my knowledge, at half-past two o'clock in the
</p>
<p>day. Our clock had stopped, and Dr. Lilley, a physician who stops
</p>
<p>at my stable, came up and gave me the time of day.
</p>
<p>Q. When Atzerodt engaged the horse, did you have a conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with him ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. State what that conversation was.

<p>as incompetent.

<p>The question was waived.

<p>A. He did.

<p>Q. Have you got that slate with you?
</p>
<p>A. I had that slate, but I think my partner took off the con-
</p>
<p>tents of the slate a few days afterwards.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he write that in a large or small band ?
</p>
<p>A. He had written it in a tolerable good hand. I had com-
</p>
<p>menced to write it myself, but by some means or other I was called
</p>
<p>off, and he wrote it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not hesitate to put down his name ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you require of him any references?

</p>
<p>Q. Did he give them willingly ?
</p>
<p>A. He did.
</p>
<p>Q. Who did he give ?
</p>
<p>A. A number of persons in Maryland.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he give any in Washington ?
</p>
<p>A. He gave some in Maryland first. During the conversation
</p>
<p>I traced him to Port Tobacco. I asked him who he knew in Port
</p>
<p>Tobacco. He said he knew a good many persons there, and that
</p>
<p>he was a coach-maker by trade.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember any names that he gave in Port Tobacco ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you remember any names given in Washington?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; John Cook was one.
</p>
<p>Q. Where does John Cook live ?
</p>
<p>A. Right opposite me.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you go to John Cook and inquire about Atzerodt?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I did.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that horse returned ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say at what hour it was returned, because I did not
</p>
<p>stay there to see it returned ; but the horse was not there, to the
</p>
<p>best of my knowledge, between nine and half-past nine o'clock that
</p>
<p>night. I hired it out myself. I never allow anybody else to hire
</p>
<p>out the horses but myself or my partner.
</p>
<p>Q. Did or did not the prisoner pay you for the horse ?
</p>
<p>A. He did ; he paid me five dollars.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see his purse or pocket-book ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not notice it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q. At what time was the horse returned ?
</p>
<p>A. That I cannot say, because I was not there.
</p>
<p>Q. The horse was there the next morning, when you came to
</p>
<p>the stable ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

<p>that he spoke of anywhere in the country.
</p>
<p>A. Stanley Higgins was one, I know.
</p>
<p>Q. Who else?
</p>
<p>A. Then I traced him 
</p>
<p>Q. I do not care about your tracing, but who else did he name?
</p>
<p>A. I traced him to Bryan town.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you think who he named there ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; I cannot.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you given all you can think of here in the city ?
</p>
<p>A. I have given John Cook. He gave several others on the

<p>Avenue, but I disremember who they were.
</p>
<p>Q. You do not remember who he named at Bryantown ?

</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice the time ?
</p>
<p>A. We have got a clock there, but it is not going.
</p>
<p>Q. In what condition was this mare when he brought her in ?
</p>
<p>A. Very much the same condition as when she went out.
</p>
<p>Q. Did she look as though she had been ridden hard ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not exactly.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any foam on her ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or not have a light in the stable when the man

</p>
<p>Q. You saw the man who brought the mare back as he rode in ?
</p>
<p>A. He did not ride into the stable,
</p>
<p>Q. Did he lead her into the stable ?
</p>
<p>A. He stopped outside of the door, and I went out there and

<p>brought her in.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any light on the sidewalk ?

<p>Q. Did you bring the mare in under the light afterwards ?

<p>Samuel McAllister,
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, George A. Atzerodt : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever, during the month of April, see arms in th
</p>
<p>possession of Atzerodt ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. What were they ?
</p>
<p>A. A pistol and dirk.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or not give them to you to keep for some time ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; they were in the desk.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think you would recognize them ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I would. The pistol was a new one,
</p>
<p>a six-barrelled revolver. I think I would recognize the knife if I
</p>
<p>saw it.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the knife found at the Kirk wood
</p>
<p>House.] Look at that knife, and see if that is the one you kept.
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; that is not the knife ; it was in a black sheath.
</p>
<p>Q. [ Exhibiting to the witness the pistol found at the Kirkwood
</p>
<p>House.] Was the pistol that you kept for Atzerodt any thing like
</p>
<p>that one ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; that is not the pistol.

</p>
<p>A. I could not tell now, but it looks a good deal like it.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to tbe witness the knife found near Ninth and F
</p>
<p>Streets on the morning of the 15th of April.] Does that look like
</p>
<p>the knife you kept for Atzerodt ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that looks very much like the knife ; it was a knife
</p>
<p>of that description.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the black coat found at the Kirk-

<p>on the prisoner, Atzercdt.
</p>
<p>A. Never. He never wore a coat of that kind, to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>He used to wear a dark-gray coat.
</p>
<p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, Atzerodt, and say whether
</p>
<p>you ever saw him have on different clothing from that which he is
</p>
<p>now wearing.
</p>
<p>A. That is the same clothing he had on when he was at our
</p>
<p>place.
</p>
<p>Q. The same suit ?
</p>
<p>A. The same suit. He also had a light, loose gray overcoat,
</p>
<p>which he bought on the Avenue a few days before this thing occurred,
</p>
<p>on the 12th or 13th of April. I cannot remember the time he

<p>bought it.

</p>
<p>A. I am.

<p>Q. [Exhibiting to the witness the black coat found at the Kirk-

</p>
<p>Captain Frank Monroe, U.S.N. ,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, George A. Atzerodt, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Doster :
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not you had the custody of the
</p>
<p>prisoners at the bar subsequent to their arrest.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was this ?
</p>
<p>A. On board the monitors Saugus and Montauk.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. Before I go any further with the examination of
</p>
<p>this witness, I beg to submit an application of the prisoner in writ-
</p>
<p>ing:
</p>
<p>" The prisoner Atzerodt, by his counsel " 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Adtocate Bingham. Let us see what it is
</p>
<p>before you read it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. It is merely a request of the prisoner, Atzerodt,
</p>
<p>through his counsel, as you will hear.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett. Let us see it before it is
</p>
<p>read to the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster submitted the paper to the Judge Advocate, who,
</p>
<p>after examining it, said, 
</p>
<p>If the Court please, this is a simple proposition, as I understand
</p>
<p>it, on the part of the prisoner, Atzerodt, that his confessions made
</p>
<p>to the witness shall be heard by this Court as testimony in his
</p>
<p>favor,  confessions in regard to which no evidence whatever has
</p>
<p>been introduced by the Government. The matter is too plain for
</p>
<p>discussion. Certainly I cannot understand on what ground such an
</p>
<p>application can be urged.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. The only grounds upon which it can be urged are
</p>
<p>stated in the paper. It is done simply because the prisoner desires
</p>
<p>to make a full statement of his guilt in this transaction, if there is
</p>
<p>any guilt, and of his innocence, as fai' as there is any evidence
</p>
<p>of it.

<p>The Judge Advocate. He can do that in the presentation of his

<p>case to the Court.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 515
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. He proposes now to make
</p>
<p>himself a witness. That is the trouble.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. He asks it also because he has been debarred from
</p>
<p>calling any of the other prisoners, who might be his witnesses, for
</p>
<p>the reason that they are joined as co-defendants. He asks, there-
</p>
<p>fore, that, through Captain Monroe, he may be allowed to speak, as
</p>
<p>he would otherwise speak through one of these co-defendants.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. They would be precluded just as much
</p>
<p>as this witness is from speaking in regard to this matter, because it
</p>
<p>is incompetent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I am very well aware that the rule of law is against
</p>
<p>me. I ask it entirely as a matter of fairness and liberahty, appeal-
</p>
<p>ing solely to the liberality of the Court.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate. It is greatly to be deplored that the coun-
</p>
<p>sel will urge upon the Court propositions which they know to be
</p>
<p>contrary to law. We have no time to devote to the discussion of
</p>
<p>such propositions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. I have no more to ask the witness, then.
</p>
<p>There being no further witnesses for the defence in attendance,
</p>
<p>the Commission adjourned until to-morrow, Wednesday, May 31, at
</p>
<p>ten o'clock, a.m.

<p>him.

<p>Q. Did the prisoner, Atzerodt, have an overcoat on at the time

</p>
<p>A. He had on an overcoat when he came to my house. When

<p>I met him in the morning he had the overcoat hanging on his arm,
</p>
<p>and when he came to my house he had it on.
</p>
<p>Q. What kind of an overcoat was it ?
</p>
<p>A. A sort of gray-looking overcoat.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster then called for several witnesses who had been
</p>
<p>summoned on behalf of George A. Atzerodt, but none of them
</p>
<p>appeared.
</p>
<p>The President. If there are no other witnesses, I shall move
</p>
<p>that the Court adjourn.
</p>
<p>Mr. Doster. If the Court please, I have summoned a great
</p>
<p>many witnesses for Atzerodt, but it seems they are not here ; ;ind
</p>
<p>consequently, in order to go on with the defence, I shall be obliged
</p>
<p>to call some of the witnesses for Payne. I had intended to present
</p>
<p>them in a certain order to the Court, and I therefore desire that they
</p>
<p>should all be here before I present any. If, however, the Court
</p>
<p>insist on it, I shall have to proceed with those who are here. To
</p>
<p>explain why I wish to proceed with Payne's witnesses in a certain
</p>
<p>order, I will state that I intended to set up the plea of insanity,
</p>
<p>and in setting up that plea, I desired to commence with his disposi-
</p>
<p>tion from youth ; and I was therefore compelled to summon friends
</p>
<p>and relations of his living several thousand miles away from here.
</p>
<p>They have not yet arrived, and I cannot therefore now present them
</p>
<p>to the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I believe there are some witnesses present on the
</p>
<p>part of Arnold, and, if the Court please, I will proceed with them.

<p>I saw him as a child frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you have ever heard Booth speak of Samuel
</p>
<p>K. Chester ; and, if so, in what connection, and where.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to any proof
</p>
<p>about what he said in regard to Chester.
</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Ewing.] State whether or not Booth ever applied
</p>
<p>to you to employ Chester, who has been a witness for the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion, in your theatre ?

</p>
<p>is certainly not competent to introduce declarations of Booth made
</p>
<p>to anybody, in the absence of a witness that may be called, relative
</p>
<p>528 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>to a transaction of his, to affect him in any way at all. I object to
</p>
<p>it as wholly incompetent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. It is not to attack Chester, may it please the
</p>
<p>Court, that I make this inquiry, but rather to corroborate him ; to
</p>
<p>show that Booth, while manipulating Chester to induce him to go
</p>
<p>into a conspiracy for the capture of the President, was actually at
</p>
<p>the same time endeavoring to induce Mr. Ford to employ Chester,
</p>
<p>in order that he might oret him here to the theatre and use him as
</p>
<p>an instrument : and it goes to affect the case of several prisoners at
</p>
<p>the bar ; the case of the prisoner Arnold, who in his confession, as
</p>
<p>orally detailed here, stated that the plan was to capture the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, and Chester corroborates that ; and also to aSvsist the case of
</p>
<p>the prisoner, Spangler, by showing that Booth was not able to get
</p>
<p>or did not get in the theatre any instruments to assist him in the
</p>
<p>purpose, and was endeavoring to get them brought there,  men
</p>
<p>that he had previously manipulated. I think it is legitimate.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. Nothing can be clearer,
</p>
<p>if the Court please, than that it is utterly incompetent. It is not
</p>
<p>a simple question of relevancy here ; it is absolute incompetency.
</p>
<p>A party who conspires to do a crime may approach the most upright
</p>
<p>man in the world, with whom he has been, before the criminality
</p>
<p>was knovra to the world, on terms of intimacy, and whose position
</p>
<p>in the world was such that he might be on terms of intimacy with
</p>
<p>reputable gentlemen. It is the misfortune of a man that is ap-
</p>
<p>proached in that way ; it is not his crime, and it is not colorably his
</p>
<p>crime either. It does not follow now, because Booth chose to
</p>
<p>approach this man Chester, that Booth is therefore armed with the
</p>
<p>power, living or dead, to come into a court of justice and prove on
</p>
<p>his own motion, or on the motion of anybody else, what he may
</p>
<p>have said touching that man to third persons. The law is too
</p>
<p>jealous of the reputation and character of men to permit any such
</p>
<p>dealings at all.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.

</p>
<p>Q. [By Mr. Ewing.] State what were the duties of the accused,
</p>
<p>Edward Spangler, on the stage.
</p>
<p>A. Spangler was employed as a stage-hand, frequently misrep-
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 529
</p>
<p>resented as the stage-carpenter of the theatre. He was a laborer
</p>
<p>to assist in the shoving of scenery into its place, and removing it
</p>
<p>within the grooves as the necessity of the play required. These
</p>
<p>were his duties at night, and during the day to assist in doing the
</p>
<p>rough carpenter work incidental to plays to be produced.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not his duties were such as to require his
</p>
<p>presence upon the stage during the whole of a play.
</p>
<p>A. Strictly so. His absence for a moment might imperil the
</p>
<p>success of a play, and cause dissatisfaction to the audience. It is
</p>
<p>very important to the effect of a play that the scenery should be
</p>
<p>well attended to in all its changes ; and he is absolutely important
</p>
<p>there every moment from the time the curtain rises until it falls.
</p>
<p>There are intervals, it is true, but he cannot judge how long or
</p>
<p>how brief a scene may be.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether his constant presence during the second scene
</p>
<p>of the third act of the *' American Cousin " would be necessary ?
</p>
<p>A. It would, unless he was positively informed of the duration
</p>
<p>of that scene. It is rather a long scene,  longer than perhaps any
</p>
<p>other scene in that act.
</p>
<p>Q. How is it with the first scene of the third act ?
</p>
<p>A. It is quick,  but a few moments. The other is eight, or
</p>
<p>ten, or probably twelve minutes long.
</p>
<p>Q. How is it with the second act?
</p>
<p>A. The duration of a scene, I should say, depends very much
</p>
<p>on the action of the parties engaged in it,  the spirit of the actors.
</p>
<p>Sometimes it is much more rapid than others. In the second act,
</p>
<p>I hardly think there is an interval between the time he would move
</p>
<p>the scenes of more than five or eight minutes,  between those
</p>
<p>numbers, I should say.
</p>
<p>Q. His constant presence upon the stage, therefore, during the
</p>
<p>second act, throughout it, would be necessary ?
</p>
<p>A. Absolutely, if he attended to his duties.
</p>
<p>Q. What were his duties in the intervals between the scenes?

</p>
<p>A, To be prepared for the next change ; to be ready at his
</p>
<p>scene ; to remain on the side where the stage-carpenter had assigned
</p>
<p>him as his post of duty. Emergencies often arise during an act.
</p>
<p>that require extra service of a stage-hand.
</p>
<p>VOL. II. 45
</p>
<p>530 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. State who had the regulation and control of the passage-way
</p>
<p>through which Booth escaped.
</p>
<p>A. The stage-manager directs, the stage-carpenter executes the
</p>
<p>work belonging to that part of the theatre and to the entire stage.
</p>
<p>Q. State who they were.
</p>
<p>A. John B. Wright was the stage-manager, James J. Gifford
</p>
<p>the stage-carpenter.
</p>
<p>Q. Has not Gifford some subordinate who is charged with the
</p>
<p>duty of keeping the passage-way in its proper condition ?
</p>
<p>A. None except his stage-hands. It is the duty of each and
</p>
<p>every one ; it is as indispensable as keeping the front door clear.
</p>
<p>The action of the play would be ruined by any obstruction or
</p>
<p>incumbrance there.
</p>
<p>Q. The stage-hands on which side of the theatre?
</p>
<p>A. Of course, on the side where this passage is.
</p>
<p>Q. That is the side opposite to the one on which Spangler
</p>
<p>worked ?
</p>
<p>A. I presumed you meant what we call the prompt-side, the side
</p>
<p>on which the prompter is located, the chief passage of the theatre ;
</p>
<p>Spangler worked on the other side. The stage-carpenter's place
</p>
<p>was to be on this side, but we frequently do not require actual work
</p>
<p>by him : he manages the scenery, but leaves it to the stage-hands to
</p>
<p>work the scenes unless there is a difficult play. His location is near
</p>
<p>the stage-manager, to receive his directions, and to be subordinate
</p>
<p>to him.
</p>
<p>Q. And the two are located on the stage, on the side opposite to
</p>
<p>that where the prisoner, Spangler, worked upon ?
</p>
<p>A. Directly opposite. They are on the prompt-side ; he on the
</p>
<p>0. P. side, opposite the prompt-place.
</p>
<p>Q. Then I understand that the prisoner, Spangler, would not be
</p>
<p>charged with the duty of keeping that passage-way in order ?
</p>
<p>A. That was no duty of his, unless specially assigned to him by
</p>
<p>the stage-carpenter : he was subordinate entirely to the stage-car-

</p>
<p>penter.
</p>
<p>Q. Now state whether or not that passage-way is generally ob-
</p>
<p>structed in any way.
</p>
<p>A. It should never be obstructed. My positive orders are to
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 531
</p>
<p>keep it always clear and in the best order. It is the passage-way-
</p>
<p>used by all the parties coming from the dressing-rooms. Where a
</p>
<p>play was performed like the " American Cousin," the ladies were
</p>
<p>in full dress, and it was absolutely necessary that there should be no
</p>
<p>obstruction there, in order that the play should be properly performed.
</p>
<p>Coming from the dressing-rooms and the green-room of the theatre,
</p>
<p>every one had to use that passage. The other side of the stage was
</p>
<p>not used more than a third as much, probably. Most of the entrances
</p>
<p>by the actors and actresses are made on the prompt-side ; but many
</p>
<p>are essential to be made on the 0. P. side. By entrances to the
</p>
<p>stage, I mean to the presence of the audience.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether, as a matter of fact, that passage-way
</p>
<p>was kept by the stage-manager clear ?
</p>
<p>A. The stage-manager was a very exacting man in all those
</p>
<p>details ; and I have always found it clear, unless there was some
</p>
<p>spectacular play in which he required the whole spread of the stage.
</p>
<p>Then at times it would be partly encumbered, but not enough so to
</p>
<p>prevent the people going around the stage, or going to the cellar-way
</p>
<p>and underneath, and passing to the other side by way of the
</p>
<p>cellar.
</p>
<p>Q, Was the '* American Cousin " such a spectacular play?
</p>
<p>A. No : it was a very plain play ; no obstruction whatever could
</p>
<p>be excused on account of that play ; it was all what we call flats,
</p>
<p>except one scene : the flats are the large scenes that cross the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner, Edward Spangler, wear a
</p>
<p>mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. Never.
</p>
<p>Q. State his relations to Booth, as far as you have known them
</p>
<p>to be together at all.
</p>
<p>A. He seemed to have a great admiration for Booth. I have
</p>
<p>noticed that in my business on the stage with the stage-manager.
</p>
<p>Booth was a peculiarly fascinating man, and controlled the lower
</p>
<p>class of people, such as Spangler belonged to, I suppose more than

<p>ordinary men would,  a man who excelled in all manly sports.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Spangler at all in the employment of Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Was he in the habit of waiting upon him ?
</p>
<p>532 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I only heard so ; I never knew, until after tte assassination,
</p>
<p>that lie had been so employed.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether or not, from your knowledge of
</p>
<p>Booth, the leap from the box upon the stage would be a difficult
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>A. By no means, I think. He excelled in every thing of that
</p>
<p>kind. He had a reputation for being a great gymnast. He intro-
</p>
<p>duced, in some Shaksperian plays, some of the most extraordinary
</p>
<p>and outrageous leaps, deemed so by the critics, and condemned by
</p>
<p>the press at the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him make any of those extraordinary leaps ?
</p>
<p>A. I did on one occasion, and the " Baltimore Sun " condemned it
</p>
<p>in an editorial article the next day,  styled him the " gymnastic
</p>
<p>actor." It was in the play of Macbeth, the entrance to the witch
</p>
<p>scene : he jumped from a high rock down on the stage, as high, or
</p>
<p>perhaps higher, than the box ; I think about as high, nearly, as from
</p>
<p>the top of the scene.
</p>
<p>Q. You think, then, from your knowledge of the physical powers
</p>
<p>of Booth, that that leap was one that he would not need to re-
</p>
<p>hearse ?
</p>
<p>A. I would not think a rehearsal of it was needed. He was a
</p>
<p>very bold, fearless man : he always had the reputation of being of
</p>
<p>that character. I should not suppose any rehearsal would be neces-
</p>
<p>sary. We never rehearse leaps in the theatre, even when they are
</p>
<p>necessary to the action of the play : they may be gorte over the first
</p>
<p>time a play is performed, but it is not usual.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you think that leap from the President's box upon the
</p>
<p>stage would be at all a difficult one for Booth ?
</p>
<p>A. I should not think so : I have seen him make a similar leap
</p>
<p>without any hesitation, and I am aware that he usually introduced
</p>
<p>it in the play of Macbeth, as I stated before.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he make the leap of which you speak with ease ?
</p>
<p>A. Apparently ; without any hesitation, at least ; no effect fol-

<p>lowing it.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you have any knowledge as to Booth's fre-
</p>
<p>quenting Ford's Theatre.
</p>
<p>A. I seldom visited the theatre but what I found him about, or
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 533
</p>
<p>near it, during the day, while I was there. I usually came down to
</p>
<p>the theatre three days a week, devoting the other three to my busi-
</p>
<p>ness in Baltimore, and being there between the hours of ten and
</p>
<p>three. I would nearly always meet Booth there when he was in
</p>
<p>the city. He had his letters directed to the theatre, and that was
</p>
<p>one cause of his frequent visits there, as I thought then.
</p>
<p>Q. During what period was that?
</p>
<p>A. Nearly the entire season, which commenced about the 1st of
</p>
<p>September,  say from the latter part of September up to the time
</p>
<p>I saw him last in Washington.
</p>
<p>Q. When was that last time you saw him ?
</p>
<p>A. Some two or three weeks before the assassination. Just
</p>
<p>previous to the assassination my wife was in bad health, and I was
</p>
<p>not down here as frequently as I had been before.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you state whether or not you were here about the 2d of
</p>
<p>April ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not positively without some reflection. It is hard to
</p>
<p>locate a date precisely. I usually came down here on Mondays,
</p>
<p>Wednesdays, and Fridays, but sometimes it was on Tuesdays,
</p>
<p>Thursdays, and Saturdays. I cannot say positively that I was here
</p>
<p>on the day named.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know where the actor, John McCullough, was
</p>
<p>then ?
</p>
<p>A. In New York ; or at least he ought to have been there. Mr.
</p>
<p>Forrest was acting there, and he always appears in his plays. His
</p>
<p>last appearance at my theatre was the 18 th of March ; that, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve, was the night the "Apostate " was played, and his last service
</p>
<p>in the theatre. Mr. Forrest was within a week to appear in New
</p>
<p>York, and he accompanied him.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not you know any thing of the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Spangler, having been in the habit of going to Baltimore, and for
</p>
<p>what, during the spring.
</p>
<p>A. I know that he had lived in Baltimore, and buried his wife

</p>
<p>there some eight or ten months, or probably a year, ago, whilst in
</p>
<p>my employ, and that he considered Baltimore his home, and usually
</p>
<p>spent the summer months, during the vacation of the theatre, there,
</p>
<p>chiefly in crabbing and fishing. He was a great fisher and crabber.
</p>
<p>45*
</p>
<p>534 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>I know notliing positive of my own knowledge as to that. I only
</p>
<p>heard that, and we used to plague him about it.
</p>
<p>Q. [Exhibiting to witness the coil of rope found in a carpet at
</p>
<p>the house where Spangler took his meals,] Look at that rope, and
</p>
<p>see whether or not it might be used for any such purpose, and in
</p>
<p>what way.
</p>
<p>A. I suppose that could be used as a crab-line, though it is rather
</p>
<p>short for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Q. Explain to the Court how it could be used.
</p>
<p>A. I have seen them catch crabs with a long rope, and with
</p>
<p>smaller ropes or lines appended to it, which they fixed to it. The
</p>
<p>ropes are supported by buoys : they spread them out to catch crabs.
</p>
<p>The professional crabbers use much longer ropes than this,  those
</p>
<p>who make a business of it.
</p>
<p>Q. What length of rope have you seen used in that sport?
</p>
<p>A. Four or five hundred feet.
</p>
<p>Q. Have you seen shorter ropes than that used ?
</p>
<p>A. I have seen some as short used. I have read that the length
</p>
<p>of this is eighty feet, but I do not know from its appearance.
</p>
<p>Q. This is such a rope as you have seen used by amateurs in that
</p>
<p>sport ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; I have seen such ropes. I frequently go fishing
</p>
<p>in the summer.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court what your object was in going to Richmond
</p>
<p>about the time of the assassination of the President of the United
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>A. I had there an uncle, a very aged man, and a mother-in-law,
</p>
<p>the mother of my wife ; and hearing of the partial destruction of
</p>
<p>Richmond by fire, I went there anxious to ascertain their condition.
</p>
<p>I arrived there on Friday. I did not hear of the assassination until
</p>
<p>Sunday night, and then I heard that Edwin Booth was charged with
</p>
<p>it. On Saturday morning my uncle, the only male blood-relative I
</p>
<p>found there, went up with me to take the oath of allegiance. On

<p>Sunday I spent the day with him, and on Monday morning I started
</p>
<p>for Baltimore and Washington by the six o'clock boat ; and at the
</p>
<p>boat I first saw the Richmond Whig, which confirmed the report I
</p>
<p>had heard on Sunday night of the assassination. I wa! m company,

<p>wbile at Pticbraond, with Colonel Forney and others, conferring with
</p>
<p>them, at times, in regard to people I had known there when I lived
</p>
<p>there for three or four years from 1850.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Judge Advocate :
</p>
<p>Q. You do not mean to state to this Court that the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Spangler, intended to catch crabs with that rope which was shown to
</p>
<p>you?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. That rope could be used quite as well for other purposes as
</p>
<p>for catchins: crabs ?
</p>
<p>A. Unquestionably. I have no doubt of that.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not the private boxes in your theatre, of
</p>
<p>which the President occupied one, are ordinarily kept locked when
</p>
<p>not in actual use.
</p>
<p>A. I cannot state that positively. I did not spend a great many
</p>
<p>nights in Washington. In Baltimore we always keep the private
</p>
<p>boxes locked.
</p>
<p>Q. Who has the custody of those boxes during the day, when
</p>
<p>they are not actually occupied ?
</p>
<p>A. The stage-carpenter, Mr. GifFord, had control of the whole
</p>
<p>theatre, and would be the responsible party I should blame for any
</p>
<p>thing wrong about the boxes.
</p>
<p>Q. You cannot state, therefore, whether they were locked or
</p>
<p>not?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. In Baltimore we keep them locked, and keep the
</p>
<p>keys in the box-office where we sell the boxes to patrons. Here I
</p>
<p>understand that the ushers retained the keys.
</p>
<p>Q. Who was the usher in this building?
</p>
<p>A. The chief usher was James O'Brien, the usher of the dress-
</p>
<p>circle and of the boxes on that tier.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know who had for sale the tickets for those boxes
</p>
<p>that day ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : the authorized parties were my two brothers, James

<p>K. and Henry Clay Ford.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the fact that none of the boxes were occupied
</p>
<p>that night except that occupied by the President ?
</p>
<p>636 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>A. I have only heard so.
</p>
<p>Q. Is the play of the "American Cousin" a popular one?
</p>
<p>Does it attract considerable audiences ?
</p>
<p>A. It was, when originally produced, an exceedingly attractive
</p>
<p>play : of late years it has not been a strong card, but a fair attrac-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it not a very unusual thing, when such plays are pro-
</p>
<p>duced, for your private boxes to be entirely empty ?
</p>
<p>A. Washington is a very good place for selling boxes usually.
</p>
<p>They are generally in demand, and nearly always two or three boxes
</p>
<p>are sold.
</p>
<p>Q. Can you recall any occasion on which a play so popular and
</p>
<p>attractive as that was presented when none of your private boxes,
</p>
<p>save the one occupied by the President, was used ?
</p>
<p>A. I remember occasions when we sold no boxes at all, and had
</p>
<p>quite a full house,  a good audience ; but those occasions were rare.
</p>
<p>My reason for constructing so many boxes to this theatre was, that
</p>
<p>usually private boxes were in demand in Washington,  more so
</p>
<p>than in almost any other city. It is not a favorable place to see a
</p>
<p>performance ; but it is a fashionable place here to take company.
</p>
<p>Q. Did I understand you to say, that, from the character of the
</p>
<p>two men, and their relations to each other, as known to you, Booth
</p>
<p>would be likely to exert a large influence over the prisoner, Span-
</p>
<p>gler?
</p>
<p>A. I think he would over men of that class that he came in
</p>
<p>contact with.
</p>
<p>Q. Either for good or evil, as it might chance to be ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By the Court :
</p>
<p>Q. State the size of the rope usually used as a crab-rope.
</p>
<p>A. I merely know the length of the rope I have seen here.
</p>
<p>Q. Give the dimensions of it, the width around, by the usual
</p>
<p>rule of measurement.

</p>
<p>A. I have rather a bad eye for size. I suppose this rope is
</p>
<p>nearly an inch round in circumference.
</p>
<p>Q. Is it at least an inch ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think so.

</p>
<p>J. P. FUKGUSON,
</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, Edward Spaugler : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>- Q. State to the Court whether, dh-ectly after the assassination of
</p>
<p>the President, you saw Mr. Stewart get upon the stage.
</p>
<p>A. I am not personally acquainted with Mr. Stewart ; do not
</p>
<p>know that I know the gentleman at all. I saw a gentleman, the
</p>
<p>first one who got upon the stage after Booth passed off. He was a
</p>
<p>laro'e man, dressed in li^'ht clothes, with a mustache. I do not
</p>
<p>know whether it was Mr. Stewart or not. A moment after he
</p>
<p>jumped on the stage. Miss Harris called, up in the President's box,
</p>
<p>for water. I saw that man turn around and look up towards the
</p>
<p>box at a soldier who was on guard there, running plumb up. Some
</p>
<p>one halloed, *' Catch him." Laura Keene came in at the corner at
</p>
<p>the entrance right directly under where I sat ; and she raised both
</p>
<p>hands, and said, " We have got him ! " or " We will get him ! " By
</p>
<p>that time there were, I suppose, half a dozen on the stage. I then
</p>
<p>saw this large man run out by Laura Keene, at the side entrance,
</p>
<p>in the direction that Booth had taken. He was the first one to get
</p>
<p>on the stage.
</p>
<p>Q. Could you describe the color of his hair ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not. He was a large man ; I suppose as tall as T
</p>
<p>am, and heavier. He had on light clothes, and a mustache. He
</p>
<p>was the first one that got on the stage. I should suppose it was
</p>
<p>probably two or three minutes  about that long  after Booth
</p>
<p>went off the stage that this man went out of the entrance.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you seen anybody else run out of the entrance ?
</p>
<p>A. No person but Hawk, the young man who was on the dage
</p>
<p>at the time Booth jumped from the box.
</p>
<p>Q. If any one had run out of the entrance, following Booth,
</p>
<p>would you probably have seen him ?
</p>
<p>A. I would ; because I thought it very singular that those who
</p>
<p>were near the stage did not try to run and get on it. I know that

</p>
<p>if I had occupied the position some of them did, I would have got
</p>
<p>on the stage. I am not acquainted with Mr. Stewart, and would
</p>
<p>not know him now if I were to see him.
</p>
<p>538 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. You sat in the gallery all the time of this transaction?
</p>
<p>A. In the dress-circle.
</p>
<p>Q. On which side of the dress-circle did you sit, the north or
</p>
<p>the south side ?
</p>
<p>A. I sat on the north side.
</p>
<p>Q. And the entrance that you are talking about, through which
</p>
<p>the parties passed, was on the north side of the stage too ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How near did you sit to the private boxes on the north side
</p>
<p>of the gallery?
</p>
<p>A. I was very close to the private boxes.
</p>
<p>Q. Then you could not see the mouth of the entrance distinctly
</p>
<p>from where you sat ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not exactly from where I sat : I could not see it
</p>
<p>distinctly. I saw Laura Keene come on, and run in.
</p>
<p>Q. And you cannot say what persons passed between the various
</p>
<p>scenes into the general entrance at all ?
</p>
<p>A. There might have been such a thing.
</p>
<p>Q. And you cannot say any thing about that ?
</p>
<p>A. This large man was the first one that jumped^on the stage.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. Had the man any other whisker beside a mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not think he had ; but I would not be positive : he
</p>
<p>might have had.
</p>
<p>C. D. Hess,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Edward Spangler, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows: 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State your business here in Washington.
</p>
<p>A. I am the manager of Grrover's Theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Is that a theatre rival to Ford's ?
</p>
<p>A. It is so considered, I believe.

</p>
<p>Q. State whether you were in the habit of seeing John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth during the last season before the assassination of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 539
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir ; very frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether he ever made any inquiry of you in regard to
</p>
<p>the President's attending your theatre.
</p>
<p>A. He did make such an inquiry.
</p>
<p>Q. When?
</p>
<p>A. On the day before the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. State the circumstances under which the inquiry was made.
</p>
<p>A. He came into the ofiSce some time during the afternoon, I
</p>
<p>think, of Thursday, interrupted me and the prompter of the theatre
</p>
<p>in reading a manuscript, seated himself in a chair, and entered into
</p>
<p>conversation on the subject of the illumination. There was to be a
</p>
<p>general" illumination of the city on Thursday night, and he asked
</p>
<p>me if I intended to illuminate. I told him yes, I would illu-
</p>
<p>minate to a certain extent that night ; but that the next night
</p>
<p>would be my great night of the illumination, that being the cele-
</p>
<p>bration of the fall of Sumter. He asked me the question,  my
</p>
<p>impression is his words were, "Do you intend," or " Are you
</p>
<p>going to invite the President?" I think my reply was, "Yes:
</p>
<p>that reminds me I must send that invitation." I had had it in my
</p>
<p>mind for several days to invite the Presidential party down on that
</p>
<p>night,  on the night of the 14th.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you invite the President ?
</p>
<p>A. I sent Mrs. Lincoln an invitation. My notes were usually
</p>
<p>addressed to her as the best means of accomplishing the object.
</p>
<p>Q. Of getting the President there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. That was on what day ?
</p>
<p>A. On Thursday,  the day before the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. And the invitation was for that night ?
</p>
<p>A. For the following night,  the night of the assassination.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any thing marked in Booth's manner in making
</p>
<p>this inquiry of you ?
</p>
<p>A. It struck me as rather peculiar, his entering in the manner

</p>
<p>that he did : he must have observed that we were busy ; and it was
</p>
<p>not usual for him to come in and take a seat unless he was invited.
</p>
<p>He did upon that occasion, and made such a point of it, that we
</p>
<p>were both considerably surprised. He pushed the matter so far,
</p>
<p>540 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>that I got up and put the manusciipt away, and entered into con-
</p>
<p>versation with him.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he or did he not, on any occasion before that, solicit you
</p>
<p>to invite the President ?
</p>
<p>A. Not to my recollection.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you in the habit of seeing him frequently?
</p>
<p>A. Very frequently.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not it is customary in theatres to keep the
</p>
<p>passage-way between the scenes and the green-room and the dress-
</p>
<p>ing-room clear.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is a point of excellence in a stage-carpenter.
</p>
<p>If he keeps a clean stage, and his scenes well put away, the pas-
</p>
<p>sages as clear as possible, we look upon him as a careful man. It
</p>
<p>depends entu'ely on how much room they have, however, for storing
</p>
<p>scenes.
</p>
<p>Q. What is usually the width of the passage-way between the
</p>
<p>scenes and those rooms ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know of any two theatres in the country alike
</p>
<p>in that respect. It depends entirely on the construction of the
</p>
<p>building.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you consider three and a half feet a wide or a narrow
</p>
<p>passage ?
</p>
<p>A. I should consider it rather narrow.
</p>
<p>Q. Would it or not be more necessary to keep it clear if the
</p>
<p>passage-way were narrow ?
</p>
<p>A. Decidedly so.
</p>
<p>Q. You have been in Ford's Theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have been in the theatre ?
</p>
<p>Q. You know about the height of the second tier of boxes from
</p>
<p>the stage ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I do from general observation only.
</p>
<p>Q. Would you consider the leap from the second tier of boxes
</p>
<p>to the stage an extraordinary or difficult one ?
</p>
<p>cult.

<p>Q. State what box the President was in the habit of occupying
</p>
<p>when he attended your theatre.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 541
</p>
<p>A. We have two communicatino; boxes on the rio-ht-hand side of
</p>
<p>the theatre on the sta2;e floor, the lower floor 
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. We do not care any
</p>
<p>thing about inquiring into the condition of Grover's Theatre here.
</p>
<p>It is only a waste of time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. More time is wasted by objecting to it. I must
</p>
<p>insist on the question.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. I object to it because
</p>
<p>it has nothing to do with the issue. We have introduced no evi-
</p>
<p>dence here touching any transaction in Grrover's Theatre. It is
</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre that is before this Court. He proposes to go into a
</p>
<p>minute inquiry, I suppose, of all about Grrover's Theatre, and how
</p>
<p>it is built, how its stage is constructed, its scenes, its boxes, its
</p>
<p>avenues of approach, &c. I do not want to be delayed here with
</p>
<p>any such inquiry. I do not care any thing about the structure of
</p>
<p>that building.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing. I wish no very minute inquiry in regard to Grov-
</p>
<p>er's Theatre ; I merely wish to show the Court that, from the con-
</p>
<p>struction of Ford's Theatre, it would be easier for a man who
</p>
<p>sought to assassinate the President, to escape after having com-
</p>
<p>mitted the crime than it would be to escape from Grover's Theatre,
</p>
<p>had he committed the crime there. The purpose of it is very plain,
</p>
<p>to show why Ford's Theatre was selected by Booth, why Ford's
</p>
<p>Theatre is spoken of as having been the one where Booth intended
</p>
<p>to capture or assassinate the President, for the purpose of relieving
</p>
<p>the employes of Ford's Theatre, and Mr. Spangler among them,
</p>
<p>from the imputation which naturally arises from the fact that Booth
</p>
<p>had selected that theatre as the one at which he intended to commit
</p>
<p>the crime.
</p>
<p>Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham. It is very apparent that
</p>
<p>nobody can be responsible for any act of Booth, unless by his own
</p>
<p>voluntary act he assented to it ; and the introduction of proof,
</p>
<p>therefore, about Grover's Theatre can neither excuse nor tend to

</p>
<p>excuse any man connected with Ford's Theatre for any act of his ;
</p>
<p>and, unless we prove the act of somebody at Ford's Theatre, they
</p>
<p>are not responsible for it, of course. But the attempt here is to
</p>
<p>prove the structure of Grover's Theatre, and that it is not as well

<p>I do not want to be delayed here with any inquiries about Grover's

</p>
<p>The President. I do not think the Court need vote on that if
</p>
<p>the Judge Advocate objects to it. The question is evidently im-
</p>
<p>proper, and the Court so decides.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ewixg. I ask for a decision by the Commission.
</p>
<p>The Commission sustained the objection.
</p>
<p>Henry M. James,
</p>
<p>a witness called for the accused, Edward Spangler, being duly
</p>
<p>sworn, testified as follows : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. State whether you are acquainted with the prisoner Ed-
</p>
<p>ward Spangler.
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I have been for a short time.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you in Ford's Theatre when the President was assas-
</p>
<p>sinated ?
</p>
<p>A. I was.
</p>
<p>Q. State your position and the position of Edward Spangler, if
</p>
<p>you know what it was, at that time.
</p>
<p>A. I was standing ready to draw off the flat, and Mr. Spangler
</p>
<p>was standing right opposite to me on the stage, at the' time it hap-
</p>
<p>pened.
</p>
<p>Q. You heard the shot fired ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. From the position you were in, you could not then see the
</p>
<p>President's box ?
</p>
<p>A. I could not. There was a flat between me and the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>Q. From the position Spangler was in, could he see it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Could he see the front part of the stage on which Booth

<p>jumped ?

<p>THE TRIAL, 543
</p>
<p>Q. On which side of the centre of the stage ? on the side to-
</p>
<p>wards that on which the President's box was ?
</p>
<p>A. Mr. Spangler was on the side towards the President's box.
</p>
<p>Q. And was he in position to draw off the flat on the side oppo-
</p>
<p>site to you ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : he was standing right close alongside of it.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any one standing by him ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. When the shot was fired, did you see what he did ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you notice whether he moved away, or remained?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. What did you do yourself?
</p>
<p>A. I hardly know what I did. I did as the rest of them did,
</p>
<p>looked around. I was excited at the time. I did not go any-
</p>
<p>where. I just staid where I was at, standing right behind the
</p>
<p>curtain.
</p>
<p>Q. How far was Spangler from you ?
</p>
<p>A. I judge he was about ten feet. I do not know exactly ; but
</p>
<p>I judge about that.
</p>
<p>Q. Which was nearer to the door out of which Booth ran,  you,
</p>
<p>or Spangler ?
</p>
<p>A. I was nearest to it, I judge.
</p>
<p>Q. How much nearer ?
</p>
<p>A. I cannot say : there was but very little difference.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see anybody near Spangler at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you seen him previously during the play ?
</p>
<p>A. I had often seen him, every time there was any thing to do
</p>
<p>there : I did not notice him any other time, only when the scenes
</p>
<p>had to be changed I saw him there at his post.

</p>
<p>Q. How should it have been ?

<p>A. It should have been kept clear ; that was our place to keep
</p>
<p>it clear ; that is what we were there for.

</p>
<p>Q. Whose business was it particularly to see that it was clear?
</p>
<p>A. It was mine and Spangler's to keep the passage clear.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it more your business than Spangler's ?
</p>
<p>A. It was more Spangler's business.
</p>
<p>Q. Was not the passage on your side ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. And it was part of your business to keep it clear?
</p>
<p>A. It was part of my business to keep it clear.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see Spangler when the President entered the
</p>
<p>theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw him standing on the opposite side from me when the

<p>President entered.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him at the time the applause which followed the
</p>
<p>President's entry occurred ?
</p>
<p>A. I did ; and he applauded with them.
</p>
<p>Q. How?
</p>
<p>A. Loud, with his hands and feet both ; clapped his hands and
</p>
<p>stamped his feet ; seemed as pleased as anybody to see the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent come in.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any thing of Jacob Ritterspaugh near Spangler
</p>
<p>that nisfht?
</p>
<p>A. I did not. He might have been there behind some of the
</p>
<p>scenes : I did not notice him.
</p>
<p>Q. He was not out of view ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : not at the time it happened.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did you stay where you were after it happened ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not recollect. I might have stood there half a minute,
</p>
<p> may be a minute,  I cannot say, in the excitement.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you hear Spangler say any thing at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. I did not : I did not see Spangler after it happened at all.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he go away ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know.

<p>A. They are not.
</p>
<p>Q. You are positive that the mark on each of them is not your
</p>
<p>trade-mark ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.

</p>
<p>recalled for the accused, Samuel A. Mudd : 
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewing :
</p>
<p>Q. In your cross-examination, on the day before yesterday, you
</p>
<p>stated that your brother, the prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd, was a ten-
</p>
<p>ant of your father : I wish you to state what you meant by that.
</p>
<p>A. I was rather confused at the time : 1 did not know exactly

</p>
<p>what I meant by it. I suppose that to be a tenant means that a man
</p>
<p>546 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>must pay some rent or other ; and, if that is so, he is not a tenant,
</p>
<p>for he has never paid the first cent's rent for the farm since he has
</p>
<p>been on it, nor any part of the produce of the farm.
</p>
<p>Q. How do you know that ?
</p>
<p>A. I know it very well : I kept all my father's accounts for
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Q. The farm, then, was treated as your brother's in every re-
</p>
<p>spect ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>By Assistant Judge Advocate Burnett :
</p>
<p>Q, The land belongs to your father, as you stated before ?
</p>
<p>A. My brother had no deed for it except my father's word.
</p>
<p>Q. The land belongs to your father ?
</p>
<p>A. He gave his word to my brother.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you or not state before, that it belonged to your father ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose he could not levy on it and take it.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not asking you for your supposition, but I am asking
</p>
<p>you for the fact. Does the land belong to your father, or not ?
</p>
<p>A. I consider that it belongs to my brother.
</p>
<p>Q. I am not asking for your consideration : what is the fact?
</p>
<p>A. It belongs to my brother.
</p>
<p>Q. Has he any title to it ?
</p>
<p>A. He has none except father's word.
</p>
<p>Q. Has he any title to the land ?
</p>
<p>A. He has no title or deed.
</p>
<p>Q. Who has the title or deed to that land ?
</p>
<p>A. My father.

<p>THE TRIAL. 647
</p>
<p>Q. Have you been in the army ?
</p>
<p>A. Not recently : I was in the Mexican war.
</p>
<p>Q. A surgeon in the army ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I was in the quartermaster's department on Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Wool's stajff.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Herold ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you known him ?
</p>
<p>A. I have known him from early boyhood.
</p>
<p>Q. How near do you live to him?
</p>
<p>A. A. good part of the time next door.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court what is his character.
</p>
<p>A. I do not know that I can state it in better terms than to say
</p>
<p>that he is a boy.
</p>
<p>Q. State to the Court whether, from your knowledge of him,
</p>
<p>you consider him more of a boy than a man.
</p>
<p>A. I do : I consider that he is trifling, and always has been all
</p>
<p>his lifetime,  more of the boy and very little of the man about hira.
</p>
<p>Q. Easily persuaded or led ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think so from his character and what I know of him.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether he is or is not an exceedingly light and trivial
</p>
<p>boy.
</p>
<p>A. From my knowledge of him, I should think that Nature had
</p>
<p>not endowed him with as much intellect as the generality of people
</p>
<p>have.
</p>
<p>Q. How long have you lived next door to him ?
</p>
<p>A. I have not been living next door to him for the last eight or
</p>
<p>ten years.
</p>
<p>Q. How far do you live from him now ?
</p>
<p>A. Four or five squares off.
</p>
<p>Q. You see him frequently ?
</p>
<p>A. Frequently : I know his family very well, and have always
</p>
<p>known them.

</p>
<p>Q. I understand your testimony to be that you have known him
</p>
<p>from early boyhood, and that you consider his character light and
</p>
<p>trivial in the extreme ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>548 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know about what his age is ?
</p>
<p>A. He was born while I was residing in Mexico ; that is, pre*
</p>
<p>vious to the war. I had resided in Mexico previous to the war. I
</p>
<p>came home as soon as ever I saw the war comins: on ; and he was a
</p>
<p>child then, I suppose three or four years of age. They were living
</p>
<p>in my immediate neighborhood at that time. I should think his
</p>
<p>age is about twenty-two or twenty-three, something thereabouts.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you consider him now, from what you have seen of him,
</p>
<p>more of a boy than a man,  more of boyish traits ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : that is my opinion of him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Assistant Judge Advocate Bingham :
</p>
<p>Q. Herold has intellect enough to know that it is a great crime
</p>
<p>to do murder, or conspire to do murder, has he^ not ?
</p>
<p>A. He undoubtedly, I think, knows the diflference between right
</p>
<p>and wrong.
</p>
<p>H. Clay Ford,
</p>
<p>a witness for the accused, Edward Spangler, being duly sworn, tes-
</p>
<p>tified as follows ;  -
</p>
<p>By Mr. Ewinq :
</p>
<p>Q. State what business you were engaged in on the 14th of
</p>
<p>April last, and immediately preceding.
</p>
<p>A. Treasurer at Ford's Theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. State when it was first known there that the President was
</p>
<p>going to the theatre that night.
</p>
<p>A. It was first known to me about half after eleven o'clock. I
</p>
<p>had been to breakfast, and did not get back until some time after
</p>
<p>the President had engao-ed the box.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether John Wilkes Booth, was at the theatre after
</p>
<p>that on that day ; and if so, at what time.
</p>
<p>A. He was there, I think, about twelve o'clock noon, half an
</p>
<p>hour after I came to the theatre myself.
</p>
<p>Q. State whether or not the fact that the President was going
</p>
<p>to the theatre that night was communicated to. Booth.

</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I think very likely he found it out there.
</p>
<p>I am not certain whether he did or did not. I did not tell him.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 549
</p>
<p>It might have been told there at the time that the President was
</p>
<p>coming.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any thing^ of Booth afterwards on that day ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir ; not until the evening.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see him as you were going to the theatre that day?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir : I saw him coming down the street, I think, while
</p>
<p>I was standing in the door of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. State what he did then.
</p>
<p>A. He then went and commenced talking to the parties standing
</p>
<p>around. Mr. Raybold went into the house and brought him out a
</p>
<p>letter that was there for him : he sat down on the steps and com-
</p>
<p>menced to read it.
</p>
<p>Q. At what time was that he came there ?
</p>
<p>A. About twelve o'clock, noon.
</p>
<p>Q. How long did he stay ?
</p>
<p>A. I should think he staid about half an hour : he conversed
</p>
<p>a while there, and read the letter, and I went into the office ; and
</p>
<p>when I came out ag-ain he had gone.
</p>
<p>Q. State what you know about the preparation of the theatre for
</p>
<p>the reception of the President at that time.
</p>
<p>A. When I went to the theatre, my brother, James R., told me
</p>
<p>the President was to be there that night, and I told Mr. Raybold
</p>
<p>about fixing up and decorating the box for the President that night.
</p>
<p>He had the neuralgia in his face, and T fixed it up in his place. I
</p>
<p>went up there and found two flags there ready to be put up, got
</p>
<p>Mr. Raybold to help me put up those two, and another flag came
</p>
<p>down from the Treasury Department. I went up there and put up
</p>
<p>the regimental colors, blue flag in the centre, and above the two
</p>
<p>American flags. I had part of the furniture, one chair, brought
</p>
<p>from the stage and put in the box, and the sofa and a few chairs
</p>
<p>out of the reception-room, and the rocking-chair down from my
</p>
<p>sleeping-room up stairs, next door to the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you receive any suggestion from anybody as to the

</p>
<p>preparation of the box ?
</p>
<p>A. Only from Mr. Raybold and the gentleman who was there
</p>
<p>at the time, that brought the third flag down from the Treasury
</p>
<p>building, and helped me to decorate the box.
</p>
<p>650 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>. Q. What Lad Spangler to do with the decoration of the box ?
</p>
<p>A. He took the partition out of the box : there are two boxes,
</p>
<p>and taking out the partition makes them one.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it usual to remove that partition upon any such occa-
</p>
<p>sion ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : we always removed it when the President came
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Q. You had removed it when the President attended the theatre ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir. Spangler and the other carpenter, Jake, removed
</p>
<p>it, I believe.
</p>
<p>Q. How many times had the President been at your theatre
</p>
<p>during the spring and winter ?
</p>
<p>A. I do not know. I suppose about six times during spring
</p>
<p>and winter. He was there three or four times during Mr. FoiTest's
</p>
<p>ensao-ement, and twice durins; Mr. Clarke's ensraojement. Those
</p>
<p>are the only times I remember.
</p>
<p>Q. How did Spangler come to the box ? Was he sent for ?
</p>
<p>A. I suppose Mr. Raybold sent for him. I did not speak to
</p>
<p>him about taking out the partition from the box. I do not know
</p>
<p>myself.
</p>
<p>Q. Was Spangler in the box during the time you were there
</p>
<p>decorating it ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir. Spangler was on the stage at that time.
</p>
<p>Q. What was he doing ?
</p>
<p>A. He was working on the stage. I think he had a pair of
</p>
<p>flats lying down on the surface of the stage, fixing them in some
</p>
<p>way. I called for a hammer and nails, and he threw up to me
</p>
<p>two or three naUs, and handed me the hammer up from the stage.
</p>
<p>Q Do you know whether he was apprised of the fact that the
</p>
<p>President was coming, or not ?
</p>
<p>A. Oh, yes, sir I he knew the President was coming, because he
</p>
<p>was taking out the partition.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether there was any pen-knife used in the

</p>
<p>decoration of the President's box, and what became of the pen-
</p>
<p>knife ?
</p>
<p>A. I used the pen-knife in cutting the strings to tie up the flags
</p>
<p>and the picture of Washington, and left it there in the box.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL. 551
</p>
<p>Q. You left it there ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir,
</p>
<p>Q. Did you forget it ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir : I forgot it.
</p>
<p>Q. Had the picture of Washington been there before ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Why was the chair that was there brought from your sleep-
</p>
<p>ino:-room to the President's box ?
</p>
<p>A. Only because putting the other furniture in, I put the chair
</p>
<p>in with it, the chair belonging to the same set. The chair was in
</p>
<p>the reception-room in the first place, and the ushers going in there
</p>
<p>and sitting in it greased it with their hair, and we had to remove it
</p>
<p>up to our room, being a very nice chair. We put the red furniture
</p>
<p>in the box that day, and we put in the chair because it belonged to
</p>
<p>that set,  that was the only reason for putting it in,  so as to
</p>
<p>make the box look as neat as possible,
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Booth was in the habit of engaging
</p>
<p>any of the bores ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q, What box was he in the habit of engaging?
</p>
<p>A. The one he always engaged, when he engaged any, was box
</p>
<p>No. 7, on the right hand side of the theatre, the one nearest the
</p>
<p>audience : it is a part of the President's box when the partition is
</p>
<p>taken out.
</p>
<p>Q. It was one of the boxes that the President occupied ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q, How often did he occupy that box, during the season, before
</p>
<p>the assassination ?
</p>
<p>A. He secured the box three or four times ; I do not know
</p>
<p>whether he ever occupied it or not ; I never saw him in the box.
</p>
<p>He spoke to me of bringing some ladies, and sometimes he would
</p>
<p>use the box, and sometimes he would not.
</p>
<p>Q. Did he ever occupy any other box ?

</p>
<p>A. Not to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Q. Do you know whether Booth's spur caught, as he leaped
</p>
<p>from the box, in any thing ? if so, in what ?
</p>
<p>A. I have heard that it was caught in the flag ; but I do not
</p>
<p>know.
</p>
<p>552 THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Q. In what flag ?
</p>
<p>A. I understood that it was the Hue flag in the centre. I
</p>
<p>always understood so : I do not know it.
</p>
<p>Q. Who put the flag on there ?
</p>
<p>A. I placed the flag there.
</p>
<p>Q. That afternoon ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did you get that flag ?
</p>
<p>A. It came from the Treasury Building,  the Treasury Regi-
</p>
<p>ment Flag.
</p>
<p>Q. Was there any thing special or unusual in the arrangement
</p>
<p>of that box ? and if so, what ?
</p>
<p>A. The picture had never been placed in front of the box before.
</p>
<p>We mostly always used small flags ; but on this occasion, as General
</p>
<p>Grant was expected to come with the President that day, we bor-
</p>
<p>rowed these flags from the Treasury Regiment to decorate it with.
</p>
<p>Q. State where you were during the play of the " American
</p>
<p>Cousin," preceding the assassination.
</p>
<p>A. I was in the ticket-office of the theatre.
</p>
<p>Q. Were you out on the pavement at all?
</p>
<p>A. I may have been out on the pavement : I do not remember
</p>
<p>being there. I suppose I passed in and out there two or three
</p>
<p>times.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner, Edward Spangler, in
</p>
<p>front of the theatre during the play ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you ever see him wear a mustache ?
</p>
<p>A. No, sir.
