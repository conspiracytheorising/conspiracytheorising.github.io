<p>Pontine Las a well defined place in the history of this country. The
</p>
<p>temporary success of his greal conspiracy against the English and his
</p>
<p>tragic death by the hand of an assassin; and especially the fad thai he
</p>
<p>embodied in his own person the most formidable protest against the
</p>
<p>encroachments of the whites on the hunting grounds of the red men, have
</p>
<p>combined to make him the heroic figure in northwestern history during
</p>
<p>the years between the surrender of Canada to the English and the War
</p>
<p>of the Revolution. .Moreover, the genius of Parkman has made it cer-
</p>
<p>tain that the name of Pontiac will never cease to be remembered among
</p>
<p>English speaking people on this continent.
</p>
<p>What changes might have taken place in the development of the north-
</p>
<p>west had Pontiac's conspiracy been successful, can only be surmised.
</p>
<p>That he was foiled in his great purpose and after many minor successes
</p>
<p>was compelled in the end to acknowledge defeat was due to the unex-
</p>
<p>ampled intrepidity, carefulness aud soldierly training of one man. The
</p>
<p>sagacity of Henry Gladwin and his success in withstanding the long
</p>
<p>siege of Detroit, mark him as one of the very few great Indian fighters
</p>
<p>in our history. And yet when one inquires as to Gladwin's history
</p>
<p>before or after the siege of Detroit, one tinds even on the pages of Park
</p>
<p>man nothing but a misspelled name.
</p>
<p>Four years ago, the writer began the task of getting together what
</p>
<p>facts were known as to Gladwin's career. On appealing to Mr. Park-
</p>
<p>man in person, the result was a charming morning among the roses at his

</p>
<p>His name is spelled "Glandwin" in the report, bul is correctly spelled in
</p>
<p>Genera] Braddock's orderly book No. 2, as reprinted in Lowdermilk's His
</p>
<p>ton- of Cumberland. It was during this campaign thai Gladwin came
</p>
<p>under the notice of Lieutenanl Colonel Gage, with whom he sustained
</p>
<p>most friendly relations in after years. 2 Ii would be very interesting to
</p>
<p>know if at this time a personal acquaintance was formed between Lieu
</p>
<p>tenant Gladwin and George Washington, bul continued search through
</p>
<p>every book and documenl likely to shed lighl on this matter fails to give
</p>
<p>even the slightest information on the subject.
</p>
<p>In a letter from Sir Jeffrey Amherst to Lord Barrington, Secretary at
</p>
<p>War. dated Crown Point. August 10, 1759, we find this mention of
</p>
<p>( iladw in:
</p>
<p>"I now enclose to your Lordship as likewise a copy of a Com
</p>
<p>"mission to serve as Major during the < Campaign that I though! necessary

<p>"Eldest Captain of Gage's, as Major to that Regiment. * * 1 hope my
</p>
<p>"having appointed Majors to the Corps during the Campaign will meet
</p>
<p>"with His Majesty's gracious approbation."
</p>
<p>On May 28, 1760, Gen. Amhersl ordered Gladwin from New York by
</p>
<p>way of Fort Pitt, to relieve Niagara. On his way he was to leave 150
</p>
<p>men at Presq' Isle where he was to throw up an intrenchment. 4 On his

<p>way across Lake Erie, Gladwin made a char! of the const.

<p>On September 9, Vaudreuil announced to the Beaujou al Michilimack-

<p>to Bouquet that Amherst had ordered Major Robert Rogers to Michili
</p>
<p>mackinac to take possession of the upper posts. With Rogers went
</p>
<p>Captain Campbell with a detachment to garrison Detroit. On the same

<p>day Amherst wrote from Crown Point to the Duke of Rich] d:

<p>THE GLADWIN MANUSCRIPTS. 609
</p>
<p>After leaving Detroit. Gladwin sailed for England, and on .March 30,
</p>
<p>1762, he married Frances, the daughter of the Rev. John Beridge. The
</p>
<p>photograph taken from Mrs. Gladwin's portrail shews thai in middle life
</p>
<p>she was a handsome woman. Indeed at first glance the portrail would
</p>
<p>be taken for a picture of Martha Washington. That at the age of 18 she
</p>
<p>must have been a beautiful bride is quite evident: and one ran readily
</p>
<p>believe that it was with no little reluctance on both sides thai soon after
</p>
<p>the marriage the bridegroom again set his face towards the American
</p>
<p>wilderness. Perhaps it was by way of a wedding presenl that Gladwin
</p>
<p>was offered a majority in Bouquet's regimenl of Royal Americans; but he
</p>
<p>declined the proffer, because he preferred to take bis chances in the
</p>
<p>regular British army. The correspondence on the subjecl is to be found
</p>
<p>m " letter from Amherst 8 dated -T 15, 1762, stating that he had
</p>
<p>granted a commission to Major Gladwin of Wilmott's (80th Fool I in suc-
</p>
<p>ceed Major Walters in the Royal American Regiment; but in a subse-
</p>
<p>quent letter (July 2o. 1762) the General states that Major Gladwin
</p>
<p>to remain in the 80th Regiment. Gladwin explains his decision in a
</p>
<p>letter to Bouquet, dated July 29. On August 1. we get trace of Gladwin
</p>
<p>at Niagara; and on the 23d he arrived at Detroil as commandant. 9
</p>
<p>In Bouquet's correspondence with Gen. Amherst during 1763 there are
</p>
<p>occasional references to Gladwin: but the latter seems to have been little
</p>
<p>given to the use of his pen. From these scattered references one learns
</p>
<p>that Amherst had unbounded confidence in the young major; and that
</p>
<p>while steps were taken to give him relief, yet the gravity of his situation
</p>
<p>during the long seige seems not to have been appreciated at headquarters.
</p>
<p>The letter from Gladwin to Amherst, given in the Gladwin MSS.. dated
</p>
<p>November 1. 17<;.*:. states the conclusion of the whole Pontiac matter. The
</p>
<p>promotions given to Gladwin later show that his services were appreci-
</p>
<p>ated by Amherst, who bad the reputation for preferring officers id' ability
</p>
<p>to officers who had family connections; and finally the home authorities
</p>
<p>were brought to grant recognition corresponding with Gladwin's deserts.
</p>
<p>While the' seige of Pontiac was in progress, Sir Jeffrey Amherst on
</p>
<p>turning over bis command to General Gage, mi November 17. 17<;.".. said in
</p>
<p>bis instructions: "It was my intention that tin- 42d Regimenl should

<p>impracticable for that Regimenl to advance from Presq' isle this season,
</p>
<p>1 have empowered Major Gladwin to keep up the 80th Regiment on such
</p>
<p>an event.''
</p>
<p>It is not the intention here to tell the well-known story of Pontiac's
</p>
<p>seige of Detroit; but merely to give Ike hitherto unknown facts as to
</p>
<p>Gladwin's life. In a volume of Parkman's MSS., marked "Pontiac Mis
</p>
<p>cellanies. 17ti4." is a letter from Gage t<> Bradstreet, dated at New York,

<p>17*M.

<p>It is probable that the monument to Gladwin was erected a consider-
</p>
<p>able time after his death, for the date given thereon, 1794, is three vears
</p>
<p>later than his death actually occurred, as is proved h\ the record in the
</p>
<p>i rentleman's Magazine quoted above.
</p>
<p>Gladwin's rid. -si son, Charles Dakeyne of Belmonl and Stubbing was
</p>
<p>born in 1775 and died in L844, leaving one daughter. Gladwin's daugh-
</p>
<p>ter, Frances, married June 9, 1841, Francis Goodwin, Esquire, of Maple-
</p>
<p>ton. He bequeathed all his estates in ids nephew, the Rev. Henry John-
</p>
<p>son Goodwin, of Hinchleywood, county Derby, from whom they des
</p>
<p>cended ii Captain Richard Henry Goodwin, hue captain id' the 6th Foot,
</p>
<p>who assumed the additional name and arms of Gladwin a year after he
</p>
<p>came into the property.
</p>
<p>I laptain Gladwin, under the date of January ;.', 1894, writes me that he
</p>
<p>has no record of Gen. Gladwin's early life, and thai unfortunately when
</p>
<p>he came into the estate all papers and records had hern destroyed. He,
</p>
<p>however, sent photographs of General and Mrs. Gladwin, and a copy
</p>
<p>of the monument inscription as given above.

<p>Joshua Jebb, Esquire, whose descendant, the Rev. Henry Gladwyn Jebb,

<p>under tin- date of 1 >ecember 27, 1893, writes me:
</p>
<p>'I had hoped to send you some information by this day's mail on the

<p>"subject of my great grand-father, General Gladwin. The Derbyshire

</p>
<p>Indians living in the vicinity of the Fori, as well as the settlers, looked
</p>
<p>to the commandant for both justice 3 and supplies. The soldiers were
</p>
<p>contented, a fact which the captain ascribed to the absence of rum; and
</p>
<p>the Indians were seemingly friendly, although the supplies issued to
</p>
<p>them were meagre in extreme. The serial life al Detroil especially
</p>
<p>pleased the gray-haired bachelor commandant. The women surpassed
</p>
<p>his expectations; and the men. although very independent. wer<
</p>
<p>ready for pleasure. The Sunday card parlies at The commandant's quar-
</p>
<p>ters, attended by both sexes, gave to life at Detroit a zesl uo1 known at
</p>
<p>Fort Pitt; and at a ball, given in honor of the King's birthday, the array
</p>
<p>of ladies was so flue as to call forth Captain Campbell's hearty com-
</p>
<p>mendations, in one of his numerous gossipy letters to Colonel Bouquet.
</p>
<p>Moreover, both the French and the Indians were as fond of the pleasure-
</p>
<p>loving captain as their fickle natures would allow.
</p>
<p>During the summer, however, emissaries from the Six Nations came to
</p>
<p>Detroit with large belts, for the purpose of stirring up a general warfare
</p>
<p>against the English. Matters became so serious that Sir Jeffrey Amherst
</p>
<p>thought best to send Sir William Johnson to make a treaty at Detroit,
</p>
<p>and to dispatch Major Gladwin with three hundred light infantry to
</p>
<p>strengthen the western posts. On their arrival in September, Sir Wil-
</p>
<p>liam stated his conviction that the conspiracy against the English was
</p>
<p>universal; but this opinion was not shared by General Amherst. The
</p>
<p>latter thought the Indians incapable of doing serious harm, but ordered.
</p>
<p>by way of precaution, that they be kept short of powder.
</p>
<p>The visit of Sir William Johnson was the greatest social event that
</p>
<p>the people of Detroit had ever known. Captain Campbell was in his ele-
</p>
<p>ment. On Sunday evening he gave a ball to which he invited about
</p>
<p>twenty of the French maidens of the settlement. The dame began at
</p>
<p>eight o'clock in the evening and lasted until five next morning. It was
</p>
<p>opened by Sir William and Mademoiselle Cuillerie, the daughter of the
</p>
<p>principal French trader; and her black eyes made such a lasting impres
</p>
<p>sion on the gallant Indian agent that the exchange of compliments

<p>Confident of the power of England to bold all 1 ba1 she liad gained from
</p>
<p>Franco, Gladwin had no suspicions that the Indians would foolishly rush
</p>
<p>to their own destruction by an attack on The British posts. Living
</p>
<p>behind palisades, and surrounded by a cordon of discontented and intrigu-
</p>
<p>ing French, Gladwin could have no accurate knowledge of the mis-
</p>
<p>chief that for months had been plotted by the Ottawa chief, Pontiac, who
</p>
<p>had established himself, with his wives, on the narrow isle a la Peche
</p>
<p>(Peach Island), rising above the waters of Lake Ste. Claire and concealed
</p>
<p>from the view of the fort by the thickly wooded Isle au Cochon. There
</p>
<p>is no reason to believe that Pontiac had impressed himself upon Gladwin
</p>
<p>as being in any way distinguished above the other chiefs, and doubtless
</p>
<p>many of the reports like those of Rogers of the Ottawa's striking per-
</p>
<p>sonality are too highly colored. The fact remains, however, that now.
</p>
<p>at the age of fifty, Pontiac was in the full vigor of his power over the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding tribes, and that, during his connection with the whites, his
</p>
<p>keen intelligence had absorbed valuable military knowledge. According
</p>
<p>to his own account, he had saved the French at Detroit from massacre
</p>
<p>in 1746, when the great chief Mickinac (the Turtle) came with his north-
</p>
<p>ern bands "to carry off the head of the French commander and eat his
</p>
<p>heart and drink his blood." Doubtless, too, he had led the Ol lawns at
</p>
<p>Little Meadows in 17r>5, when < Had win for the first time heard the
</p>
<p>Indian warwhoop. At a great council (April, 1763), held on the hanks
</p>
<p>of the River Ecorses, below Detroit, Tontiac had related to the supersti-
</p>
<p>tious Indians a dream wherein the Great Spirit sent his message that
</p>
<p>they were to cast aside the weapons, the manufactures and the rum of
</p>
<p>the white men. and with help from above, drive the dogs in red from
</p>
<p>every post in their country. The superstitious Indians heard with awe
</p>
<p>the voice from on high, and left the council prepared to obey the sum-
</p>
<p>mons.

<p>Detroit being the chief point of attack. Pontiac took upon himself the

<p>for the purpose of spying out the land. Four days later, M. Gouin, a sub-

</p>
<p>their gun barrels, evidently preparing for some deed of treachery. On
</p>
<p>the evening of the 6th Gladwin received private information that the
</p>
<p>next day had been set for the destruction of his garrison. The exacl
</p>
<p>source of this private information is still a matter of doubt. Lieutenant
</p>
<p>McDougall, who doubtless knew the secret, gives no hint in his report.
</p>
<p>Mr. C. M. Burton makes the not impossible suggestion that Mademoi-
</p>
<p>selle Cuillerie, whose father and brother unquestionably knew of the con
</p>
<p>spiracy, put Major Gladwin on his guard, and that .lames Stirling, who

<p>him. Saving been paid and dismissed, the woman loitered at the door.
</p>
<p>Gladwin was quick ei 'jli to see that something was amiss. Being

<p>io tell her trouble, she said, after much hesitation, that as he had
</p>
<p>always behaved with much g Iness to her, she was unwilling to take

<p>saying that he had something of importance to tell him. The gates hav-
</p>
<p>ing been opened, he was conducted to Captain Campbell, second in com-
</p>
<p>mand, who sent for Gladwin. They wished to call in the interpreter,
</p>
<p>Labutte. but the Indian objected, saying that he could make himself
</p>
<p>understood in French. He unfolded the conspiracy of the Indians, and
</p>
<p>told how they would fall on the English nexl day. Having obtained a
</p>
<p>pledge of secrecy and having refused presents lesl the Indians should
</p>
<p>discover his treachery and kill him. ho left the fort secretly. The writer
</p>
<p>adds that Gladwin made a promise not to disclose the source of his infor
</p>
<p>mation, and that he kepi it. 7
</p>
<p>The crisis had come in the life of the young commandant of his
</p>
<p>majesty's forces at Detroit. Although he could not then have known
</p>
<p>the extent of the widespread conspiracy which Pontiac had planned' yei
</p>
<p>he did know that his steadfastness and his knowledge of Indian warfare
</p>
<p>were about to be put to the test. Gladwin was a soldier by choice and
</p>
<p>by training, and the seven years he had spent in England's service on the
</p>
<p>frontiers had not been without its hard lessons. In 175.") he had landed
</p>
<p>on the banks of the Potomac as a lieutenant in the ill fated l'.raddock
</p>
<p>expedition. lie was one of that band of glittering officers whom the pro-
</p>
<p>vincial soldier, George Washington, had envied as they congregated in
</p>
<p>the old Braddock House at Alexandria, whose now bare but stately stair-
</p>
<p>case and broad halls seem still to be peopled by the ghosts of fair ladies
</p>
<p>and dashing soldier gallants of a century and a quarter ago. In the
</p>
<p>ambush of Little Meadows he had learned from the brave yet cautious
</p>
<p>young Virginian that the military science of the old world was out of
</p>
<p>place in battling with the denizens of the American forests; and in the
</p>
<p>campaigns against Ticonderoga and Niagara this new knowledge had
</p>
<p>stood him in good stead. Scarcely more than a year previous he had
</p>
<p>given a hostage to fortune by leading to the altar of the little Winger-
</p>
<p>wort church in Derbyshire a beautiful girl of nineteen, from whose side
</p>
<p>military duties in America too quickly recalled him. As the prospective
</p>
<p>head of an old and honorable county family, yet with little besides his
</p>
<p>profession of arms to give him support and reputation, Henry Gladwin,
</p>
<p>at the age of thirty-three, must have realized that the peril which now

<p>nor wanting in the determination thai marks the soldier. In either

<p>the morrow would tell the story.
</p>
<p>Vboul ten o'clock the nexl morning, as Carver relates. Pontiac and his
</p>
<p>chiefs arrived, and were conducted to the council chamber, where Glad-
</p>
<p>win and his principal officers awaited their coming. As the Indians
</p>
<p>passed on they could no1 help observing a greater number of troops than
</p>
<p>usual drawn up on the parade. No sooner had the Indians entered the
</p>
<p>council chamber and Beated themselves on the skins prepared for them,
</p>
<p>than Pontiac asked the commandant why his young men, meaning the
</p>
<p>Boldiers, were thus drawn up, and parading the streets. "To keep them
</p>
<p>p.-rfcct in their exercise." was the answer.
</p>
<p>Then Pontiac began to protest his friendship and good will towards
</p>
<p>Dglish; and when he came to deliver the belt of wampum, which,
</p>
<p>according to the warning, was to he the signal for his chiefs to fire, "the
</p>
<p>governor and all his attendants drew their swords half-way from their
</p>
<p>Kcabbards; and the soldiers at the same instant made a clattering with
</p>
<p>their arms before the doors, which had been purposely left open. Even
</p>
<p>Pontiac trembled, and instead of giving the belt iu the manner proposed,
</p>
<p>delivered it according to the usual way. His stolid chiefs, who had
</p>
<p>expected the signal, continued quiet, awaiting the result."
</p>
<p>I rladwin, in his turn, made a speech. Instead of thanking Pontiac for
</p>
<p>the professions of friendship just uttered, he accused him of being a
</p>
<p>traitor, lb- said t hat i In- English, who knew everything, were convinced
</p>
<p>of Pontiac's treachery and villainous designs. Then, reaching down to
</p>
<p>the Indian chief seated nearest him, he drew aside his blanket, discover-
</p>
<p>ing' the shortened tin-lock. This entirely disconcerted the Indians.
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as he had given his word at the time they desired an audience
</p>
<p>that their persons should be safe. Gladwin said he would hold his pro-
</p>
<p>mise inviolable, though they so little deserved it. However, he advised
</p>
<p>them to make the besl of their way out of the fort, lest his youug

</p>
<p>reveal. Whereupon, thej wenl off and carried the old woman with them.
</p>
<p>When they arrived in camp, Pontiac seized the prisoner and gave lier
</p>
<p>three strokes with a stick on the head, which laid her Hat on tl- ground,
</p>
<p>and (he whole nation assembled around her, and called. -Kill her! kill
</p>
<p>her."
</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and late in the afternoon Pontiac and sei
</p>
<p>eral of his chiefs paddled across the placid river to smoke the pipe of
</p>
<p>peace with the officers of the fort. Gladwin, suspicious of so much pro
</p>
<p>testation, refused to go near them; but Captain Campbell, unwilling to
</p>
<p>lose a chance to pacify the Indians, smoked the peace-pipe with them
</p>
<p>outside the fort and took back to Gladwin the message that next day all
</p>
<p>the nation would come to council, where everything would he settled to
</p>
<p>the satisfaction of the English, after which the Indians would inline
</p>
<p>diately disperse, so as to remove all suspicion.
</p>
<p>At ten o'clock next morning the anxious watchers behind the palisades
</p>
<p>saw a fleet of canoes coming around the lower point of the long island,
</p>
<p>and as the swift-darting boats, hurried by paddle and current, covered
</p>
<p>the three miles of water the soldiers counted fifty-six of these barks, each
</p>
<p>carrying seven or eight Indians. The bows of the canoes rested lightly
</p>
<p>on the sand of the sloping bank, and the warriors made their way to the
</p>
<p>fort only to find the gates fast barred against them. Instead of the cor
</p>
<p>dial welcome they expected, an interpreter met them with the message
</p>
<p>that not above sixty chiefs might enter. Whereupon Pontiac, enraged at
</p>
<p>seeing the futility of all his stratagems, and yet confident of ultimate
</p>
<p>success, in his most peremptory manner bade the interpreter say to
</p>
<p>Gladwin that if all the Indians had not free access to the fort, none of
</p>
<p>them would enter it. "Tell him," said the angry chief, "that he may stay
</p>
<p>in his fort, and that I will keep the country." Then Pontiac strode to
</p>
<p>his canoe and paddled for the Ottawa village. His followers, knowing
</p>
<p>that the fight was on. ran like fiends to the house of an English
</p>
<p>woman and her two sons, whom they tomahawked and scalped. An
</p>
<p>other party paddled swiftly to Isle an Cochon, where they first killed
</p>
<p>twenty-four of King George's bullocks, and then put to death an old Eng

</p>
<p>but on returning to the spot, so tradition relates, they were surprised to
</p>
<p>see an arm protruding from the grave. Thrice the dirt was heaped
</p>
<p>above the bodv, and thrice the arm raised itself above the ground, until
</p>
<p>the mound was sprinkled with holy water; then the perturbed spirit left
</p>
<p>the bodv in peace never since disturbed. Having put to death all the
</p>
<p>English outside the fort, the Indians sent to Gladwin a Frenchman to
</p>
<p>report both the killing of the woman and her children and also the mur-
</p>

</p>
<p>dm bis return to the Ottawa village, Pontiac ordered the squaws to
</p>
<p>change the camp to the western bank, above the fort. As the night
</p>
<p>gathered upon the tireless river, dropping a curtain between the
</p>
<p>great chief ;m<l his enemies, Pontiac bimself, hideous in war paint,
</p>
<p>leaped into the center of the ring of braves, and nourishing his toma-
</p>
<p>liawk, began to chanl the record of his valorous deeds. One by one the
</p>
<p>listening braves, catching the contagion from their mighty chief, were
</p>
<p>drawn into the ring, until al last every savage was wildly dancing the
</p>
<p>war-dance. There was no sleep for the garrison that night. Gladwin,
</p>
<p>as be paced the wide streel thai encircled the buildings of the fort just
</p>
<p>within the pickets, io.>k council with himself as to how he might with-
</p>
<p>stand his crafty enemies. Burning arrows, silent messengers of destruc-
</p>
<p>tion, might easily set fire to the four score or more wooden buildings
</p>
<p>within the enclosure; and the church, standing near the palisades, was
</p>
<p>particularly exposed, unless, indeed, the superstitious Indians should
</p>
<p>hearken to (heir only less superstitious French allies, who had threatened
</p>
<p>the savages with the vengeance of the Great Spirit if they should
</p>
<p>attempt to destroy the house of God. The two six-pounders, the three-
</p>
<p>pounder and the mortars composing the battery of the fort were of little

</p>
<p>the sure lodgmenl for an Indian bullet. The garrison was made up of
</p>
<p>one hundred and twenty two soldiers and eight officers, together with
</p>
<p>about forty fur traders and their assistants. These traders would fight
</p>
<p>e ih.ir lives, but were inclined to the French rather than to the
</p>
<p>English. Between this little garrison and the thousand savages was a

<p>great mirror reflecting the brighter stars. Gradually the black outlines
</p>
<p>of low farm houses and encircling woods melted into gray; and then
</p>
<p>beyond the wooded island a disc of molten gold, pushing itself higher
</p>
<p>and higher, made of the deep waters a broad pathway of shimmering
</p>
<p>light. On the low bluff far up the river, Gladwin's anxious eye discov
</p>
<p>ered the lodges of Pontiac's Ottawas, who, under the cover of the aighl
</p>
<p>had paddled around tin- head of the island and noiselessly established
</p>
<p>themselves above the line of French farmhouses. This meanl a siege;
</p>
<p>and as the commandant was still gazing at the preparations for war, a'
</p>
<p>pattering of bullets against the blockhouse announced the beginning'of
</p>
<p>hostilities.
</p>
<p>During the morning a party of Wyandottes, summoned by Pontiac to
</p>
<p>a council, stopped at the fort on their way. Fortified by English rum,
</p>
<p>they went off to the meeting-place under promise to Gladwin thai they
</p>
<p>would do all they could to appease the Ottawas and dissuade them from
</p>
<p>further hostilities. Next came a number of the French set this, bring-
</p>
<p>ing with them chiefs of the Ottawas, Wyandottes. Chippewas and Pot
</p>
<p>tawattamies, who told Gladwin that almost all the French had gathered
</p>
<p>at the house of the trader M. Cuillerie, where the Indians were to hold
</p>
<p>their council. They assured Gladwin that if he would allow Captain
</p>
<p><'ampbell 10 and another officer to go to the council, it would aot be hard
</p>
<p>to persuade the Indians to make peace. At any rate, it could do no harm
</p>
<p>to try; for both the French and the Indians promised to sec that the
</p>
<p>popular old Captain and his companion returned in safety thai very
</p>
<p>night. Gladwin, having little hope of turning Pontiac from his pur-
</p>
<p>poses, was reluctant to intrust Captain Campbell to their hands; hut the
</p>
<p>Captain, relying on the friendship that had existed between him and the
</p>
<p>savages, no less than on the promises id' the French, urged to lie allowed
</p>
<p>to go to the council. The deciding influence which broughl Gladwin to
</p>
<p>consent was the absolute necessity of getting into the fori a supply of
</p>
<p>corn, Hour and bear's grease; for the garrison had in store not more than
</p>
<p>enough for three weeks. So, while Captain Campbell and Lieutenant

<p>,,. to life, and as the commandant at Detroit until the
</p>
<p>arrival of M. Bellestre, the former French commandant. Then Pontiac,
</p>
<p>turning to the British officers, told them plainly that to secure
</p>
<p>the English mnsl leave the country under escorl and without arms
</p>
<p>or baggage. Thereupon M. Guillerie warmly shook Lieutenant McDou-
</p>
<p>gall's hand, saying, "My friend, this is my work; rejoice that I have
</p>
<p>obtained such g I terms for you. I thoughl Pontiac would be mucli

<p>made a Bhorl bul earnest plea for peace. Then he and Lieutenant
</p>
<p>McDougall waited anxiously for the usual grunt of approval. The
</p>
<p>moments dragged, and si ill the Indians sat impassive. For the space of
</p>
<p>an hour there was unbroken silence. Then Captain Campbell, dejected
</p>
<p>by evidenl failure, arose to retrace his steps to the fort. "My father,"
</p>
<p>-.,,,] Pontiac quietly, "will sleep tonight in the lodges of his red children."
</p>
<p>The unusual intelligence that bad raised Pontiac above every other
</p>
<p>Indian chief, had led the English to rely on his sense of honor, a quality
</p>
<p>rare indeed among savages. What civilized races call treachery is to

<p>d thai if the commandanl should retaliate on his hostages, that

<p>of the French more than to those of the Indians. It 1ms been assumed

<p>that the French at Detroil were the victims of the Pontiac conspiracy

</p>
<p>French and English over the fur trade had been as barbarous as war was
</p>
<p>in Europe during the same timr; human life on either side of the Atlantic
</p>
<p>was not considered worth a King's serious consideration; and the sol
</p>
<p>dier of that day in every nation was a freebooter. It is nm surprising
</p>
<p>that the French traders and wood rangers at Detroit should have seized
</p>
<p>upon Pontiac's war to despoil their ancienl enemies ami their conquerors
</p>
<p>of less than three years' standing. The only cause for surprise is that the
</p>
<p>French did not from the start openly make common cause with Pontiac.
</p>
<p>That they secretly gave aid and encouragement to the Indians was
</p>
<p>repeatedly charged by Gladwin. The convincing proof of his assertions
</p>
<p>is to be found in the official reports of inquiries he caused to be held at
</p>
<p>Detroit during the siege, reports which after more than a century ami a
</p>
<p>quarter of oblivion, have been found and made available by one el' Clad
</p>
<p>win's descendants. The problem for Gladwin was to hold out at Detroit
</p>
<p>until both the French and Indians could be convinced that the French
</p>
<p>government could not assist them and that the peace with England was
</p>
<p>definite and lasting.
</p>
<p>The terms proposed to Captain Campbell were offered next day to
</p>
<p>Gladwin, and the French urged him to escape while he might; but the
</p>
<p>young Englishman absolutely refused to make any terms with savages.
</p>
<p>His soldiers caught his spirit, so that he was able to write confidently to
</p>
<p>General Amherst, that he would hold out until succor should come. The
</p>
<p>schooner Gladwin, which bore the dispatch, eluded Pontiac's canoes;
</p>
<p>and when the chief reported his failure to M. Cuillerie, the Frenchman
</p>
<p>jeered at him because five canoes withdrew at the death of a single Pot
</p>
<p>tawattamie. 12
</p>
<p>Now began a long series of disasters (o the English. Cue by one the
</p>
<p>results of Pontiac's plotting transpired. Everything seemed to be giv-

<p>mandanl for Detroit. On May 25, at Fort St. Joseph, seventeen
</p>
<p>nattainies came into Lieutenant Schlosser's room on the pretense
</p>
<p>of holding a council. A Frenchman who had heard that treachery was
</p>
<p>planned, rushed in to give the alarm, whereupon Lieutenant Schlosser
</p>
<p>ized, ten of the garrison were killed, and the other three with the
</p>
<p>commnndanl were made prisoners. They were afterwards brought to
</p>
<p>Detroit and exchanged.
</p>
<p>On the 29th the long expected bateaux from Niagara were seen com-
</p>
<p>ing up i lie river. With joyful hearts the garrison looked forward to the
</p>
<p>end of their tedious siege. Bu1 as the boats came nearer, the English
</p>
<p>saw with dismay that Indians were the masters of the craft. When the
</p>
<p>foremost bateaux came opposite the schooner, two soldiers in her made
</p>
<p>the motion to change rowing places. Quickly they seized the Indians
</p>
<p>ami threw them overboard. One Indian carried his assailant with him
</p>
<p>ami in the struggle both found death. Another soldier struck the
</p>
<p>remaining Indian over the head with an oar and killed him. Under the
</p>
<p>tire of sixty savages on the shore the three plucky Englishmen escaped

<p>Niagara under Lieutenanl Cuyler, eighl had been captured and the force

<p>had been completely routed by an Indian surprise and night attack.

<p>Following the capture of the bateaux came the darkest days of the siege.

<p>Often during a whole day. the Indians, drunken on the rum from the cap-
</p>
<p>tured stores, did not fire a shot, but in their fiendish glee they gave notice

<p>July is, and were then taken to Montreal by the Ottawas.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 26th of June. Pontiac, for mingled purposes of religion
</p>
<p>and business, paddled across the green river to attend mass in the little
</p>
<p>French chapel. When the services were over, the chief selected three of
</p>
<p>the chairs in which the thrifty French had been carried to church, and
</p>
<p>making the owners his chairmen, he and his guard set off on a search for
</p>
<p>provisions. He imitated the credit certificates issue, 1 , by Clad win and
</p>
<p>gave in payment for cattle billets signed by his mark, the picture of a
</p>
<p>coon. The provisions were transported to Pontiac's camp near Parent's
</p>
<p>Creek, and in due time the billets were redeemed. The next day Pontiac
</p>
<p>sent another summons to surrender, saying thai nine hundred Indians
</p>
<p>were on their way from Michiliniackinae. and if Gladwin waited till
</p>
<p>those Indians came he would not be answerable for the consequences.
</p>
<p>Gladwin replied that until Captain Campbell and Lieutenant McDougall
</p>
<p>were returned, Pontiac might save himself the trouble of sending mes-
</p>
<p>sages to the fort. To this the wily Pontiac made answer that he had too
</p>
<p>much regard for his distinguished captives to send them back: because
</p>
<p>the kettle was on the fire for the entire garrison, and in case they were
</p>
<p>returned he should have to boil them with the rest.

<p>On the 30th of June, the Gladwin, returning from Niagara, plow, ,1 her

</p>
<p>Gladwin had guarded Detroit against surprise and had sustained a siege
</p>
<p>conducted by Pontiac in person, while fort after fort laid fallen before
</p>
<p>the savages. As the Indians returned from their successes elsewhere
</p>
<p>they were more and more eager for the overthrow of the one fort that
</p>
<p>hitherto had battled all their efforts. In his extremity Pontiac now
</p>
<p>turned on the French and threatened to force them to take up arms
</p>
<p>against the English. During the siege, however, copies of the definitive

<p>Gladwin assembled the French, read to them the articles of peace, and

<p>sent a copy across the river to the priest. Thereupon, forty Frenchmen

<p>fifty men along the sandy hank of the swift flowing river, passed the well
</p>
<p>enclosed cottages of the French and on towards a little stream that fell
</p>
<p>into the river about a mile and a half above the fort.
</p>
<p>The twenty live men in advance had just stepped on the rude bridge
</p>
<p>across the run. whm from the ridges that formed the further side of
</p>
<p>the gully came a volley of musketry that hurled the little band in con-
</p>
<p>fusion back on the main body. In the pitchy darkness, cheered on by
</p>
<p>Dalzell's steady words of command, the British swept the ridges only
</p>
<p>to find themselves chasing those deadly will-o'-the-wisps, the Hashes of
</p>
<p>an enemy's guns. To fall back was absolutely necessary; but here
</p>
<p>again the soldiers were met by the rapid tiring of the Indians who had
</p>
<p>occupied the houses and orchards between the English and the fort.
</p>
<p>Every charge of the soldiers only enveloped the pursuers in a maze of
</p>
<p>buildings, trees and fences, while the Indians beat a nimble retreat.
</p>
<p>firing from behind any shelter they could find. From an open cellar, the
</p>
<p>concealed savages poured a deadly fire into the British ranks; Km
</p>
<p>still Dalzell was undismayed. Where commands were of no effect, he
</p>
<p>beat the men with the flat of his sword. Major Robert Rogers, trained
</p>
<p>in Indian warfare, burst open the door of a cottage tilled with Indians,
</p>
<p>and with his Rangers put the ambushed savages to flight. Captain  taj
</p>
<p>fell mortally wounded in a charge. Dalzell himself, twice wounded.
</p>
<p>went to the succor of a helpless sergeant, when he too fell dead, and the
</p>
<p>Indians smeared their faces with his heart's blood. Major Rogers, who
</p>
<p>succeeded to the command, took possession of the well built Campau
</p>
<p>house, where his soldiers, fortified without by solid logs and bales of
</p>
<p>furs, and strengthened within by copious draughts from a keg of
</p>
<p>whisky, held the enemy at bay until communication could be had with
</p>
<p>the fort. Two bateaux armed with swivels soon came to the rescue
</p>
<p>of Rogers, w T ho had been besieged by about two hundred Indians. The
</p>
<p>remainder of the force under Captain Grant beat an orderly retreat. Of

<p>sions to his forces. Yet never since the siege began was Major Gladwin
</p>
<p>more hopeful of ultimate success. So the heats of August passed with an

<p>occasional skirmish, and September began. The Indians, powerless
</p>
<p>against the palisades, again turned their attention to thevessels that kept

<p>open the food communication with the settlers across the river and made
</p>
<p>occasional trips to Fort Niagara for supplies and ammunition. From one

<p>of the letter in Gladwin's own handwriting, as follows: "Bu1 on i he con-

</p>
<p>Sir: Notwithstanding what I wrote you in my last, thai all the savages
</p>
<p>were arrived, & that everything seemed in perfed tranquility; yet on

<p>the second instant the Chippewas who live in a plain near this fort,
</p>
<p>assembled to play ball, as they bad dime almost every day since their
</p>
<p>arrival; They play'd from morning till noon, then throwing their ball
</p>
<p>close to the gate, and observing Lieut. Leslie and me a few paces out of
</p>
<p>it, they came behind us. seized, and carried us into the w Is. In the
</p>
<p>meantime the rest rushed into the fort, where they found their squaws,
</p>
<p>whom they had previously planted there, with their hatchets hid under
</p>
<p>their blankets, which they took and in an instant killed Lieut. Garnet
</p>
<p>and fifteen rank and file, and a trader named Tracy; they wounded two
</p>
<p>and took the rest of the garrison prisoners, five of which they have since
</p>
<p>killed.
</p>
<p>They made prisoners of all the English traders, and robb'd them of
</p>
<p>everything they had; but offered no violence to any of the persons and
</p>
<p>properties of the Frenchmen.
</p>
<p>When this massacre was over Messrs. Langlad and Farti, the inter-
</p>
<p>preter came down to the place where Lieut. Leslie and me were prisoners,
</p>
<p>and on their giving themselves as security to return us when demanded,
</p>
<p>they obtained leave for us to go to the fort under a guard of savages,
</p>
<p>which gave time by the assistance of the above mentioned gentlemen to

<p>send for the Oatewas, who came down on the first notice and were very
</p>
<p>much displeased at what the Chippewas had done.

<p>remain in the hands of the Chippewas.

<p>He remembers the following persons thai were in the Council, viz.,

<p>very eager to find out anything to tell the Indians that they mi<iht not

</p>
<p>that Pero Barth told him that he did not believe that there was Peace;
</p>
<p>Bui that .Major Gladwin had made the Declaration himself to pacify the
</p>
<p>Indians. Francis Meloshe in the above mentioned Councill, upon read-

<p>ing the taws of Dr. Cuyless being attacked, said aloud let no man speak

<p>hi. they ate Dogs. Monsieur Denter has often told this Deponant
</p>
<p>that he would make his i scape to the Indians, for fear the Major would
</p>
<p>hang him. Pero Barth has told him the same. D was generally said
</p>
<p>among them thai if any of the French were hanged, it would be those

<p>that broughl Capt. Campble out of the Fori. This Deponant was used

</p>
<p>met with them at Monsieur Cuelleries House where they saw the Indians
</p>
<p>and French assembled in the largest room. .Monsieur Cuilliere seated
</p>
<p>in the middle with a laced hal and coat on, in which manner this Depo-
</p>
<p>nant had never seen him before, he kepi his seat & his hal on when ('apt.
</p>
<p>Campble entered & continued covered during the Congress: The Indiana
</p>
<p>had just finished eating some bread which said Cullierie had given them
</p>
<p>and on his giving them bread a second time, he again look pari of one of
</p>
<p>the Pieces and eat himself, the Indians Demanded the reason, to which
</p>
<p>he answered that it was to assure them, he gave them nothing thai was
</p>
<p>poisoned: This ("apt. Campble and another person (who he does not
</p>
<p>remember) interpreted to this Deponant. After some time Pondiac the
</p>
<p>Chief of the Indians addressed himself to the beforementioned Cuillierie
</p>
<p>telling him that he looked upon him as his Father come to life & as (he
</p>
<p>Commandant of Detroit until] the arrival of his Brother Monsieur
</p>
<p>Billeta; at which speech the said Cuilliere seemed much pleased; Then
</p>
<p>Pondiac turning addressed himself to Cap. Campble & this Deponant &
</p>
<p>told them that if they made a Peace it must he on the same terms that
</p>
<p>his Father Monsieur Billeta had made. viz.. to lav down their Arms and
</p>
<p>he escorted by a number of Savages, that he would appoint tor thai pur-
</p>
<p>pose to the first Inhabitants; hut he would not allow them to take either
</p>
<p>arms or baggage along: On which the aforesaid Cuilliere turned to this
</p>
<p>Deponant, took him by the hand and said my Friend this is my work
</p>
<p>(meaning the offered Terms). I thought they would have been much
</p>
<p>harder. Some Days after this Deponant and Capt. Campble were talk-
</p>
<p>ing to said Cuillierie, & heard him say to Capt. Campble that he was only
</p>
<p>sorry for him and Mr. Sterling, the Day the Indians met in Council to
</p>
<p>assassinate the Garrison. Some time after when the Vessel went lirst
</p>
<p>from Detroit for Niagara Pondiac detached five canoes with Indians to
</p>
<p>attack her in one of which a Potawatamie was killed, on which the others

<p>run off. The Day after Monsieur Cuillerie was in the Room with Cap.

<p>Deponant. This Deponant further saith that the Son of Cuillerie was
</p>
<p>employed carrying messages to and from Pondiac, giving information
</p>
<p>against the few French who assistaed the Fort with provisions, and pre-
</p>
<p>judicing them against listening to the account of Peace. This Deponant
</p>
<p>says further that Young Cuillerie was one of the Party who when Pon-

<p>diac in Council proposed to the French to take up arms against the Fort,
</p>
<p>that accepted the Pelt and answered he eat the same bread & drank out

<p>of the same cup, & would lire out of the same gun. This Deponanl says

<p>I.-| ant saitli :
</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman Abraham being sworn informs the Court, that in coming
</p>
<p>up Detroil River, having put on sluuv at the place of Monsieur St. Lewis,
</p>
<p>he acquainted this Deponanl that the Fort was besieged by the Indians
</p>
<p>on, Sir Roberl Daviss and a greal many more English
</p>
<p>were killed, & thai thev intended to kill all the English that would come
</p>
<p>up Detroit River. This Deponant immediately told his men to go back
</p>
<p>with him; bul the before mentioned soldiers told his men if they returned
</p>
<p>that would be all killed, as the Indians were round the whole Lake and
</p>
<p>;ii Niagara, upon which they absolutely refused to return with him. In
</p>
<p>luence of which this Deponant put all his poods in said St. Lewis's
</p>
<p>who told him he could d<> his best to save them from the Indians;
</p>
<p>Then i his Deponanl asked him where he sin mid go to hide himself to save
</p>
<p>his life, lie and .Madam Esperame (who was present) answered him he
</p>
<p>should go to her home A: hide himself in her cellar; where he continued
</p>
<p>about ten minutes and then was told by said Madam Esperame to go out
</p>
<p>of the house; which he obeyed and in going out she perceived his watch
</p>
<p>chain & told him to give it to her that she was certain the Indians
</p>
<p>would kill him ; upon which this Deponant told her he would make her a
</p>
<p>present of it, if she would let him stay in the cellar to save him from the
</p>
<p>Indians, she answered he should stay no longer in the House; upon
</p>
<p>which he endeavored to pain the w Is; she followed him, demanding
</p>
<p>the watch a second time, which I again refused. By this time the
</p>
<p>Indians discovered him, took him prisoner and carried him to St. Lewis's
</p>
<p>house, where he found some of his goods were put in his canoe. This
</p>
<p>Deponanl says further that one ivio Barth told him that Major Gladwin
</p>
<p>was the occasion of this Indian War; That if Capt. Campble had com-
</p>
<p>manded this would not have happened; That the aforesaid Major would
</p>
<p>not give the Indians presents nor suffer their puns to be mended us Capt.

<p>Jenness being indebted to Monsieur Labadie & knowing him to owe this

<p>Monsieur La Bute Indian Interpreter for the Patawatamies & < (utawas

<p>inform the French and Indians that he turned out the Commandant

<p>sieur Cuillierie as their Father and Commander, after which the said

<p>Cuillierie regaled Pondiac and the other Savages with three or four

<p>off. I thought the Savages would have done much more. This Depo-

<p>Gentlemen: We are obliged to submit to what the Indians exact from
</p>
<p>us; The English are blocked up, and all the passages are shut up; We
</p>
<p>cannot express to you the our perplexity. It would be necessary, in

<p>order to judge of the calamaties which threaten us and which appear to
</p>
<p>us inevitable, that you saw with your own eyes what is going on here.
</p>
<p>God alone can prevent our becoming the victims of the English and

<p>Savages. These Couriers bear to you the talks of the Nations here; We

<p>look upon it as a happiness to have it in our power to acquaint you of
</p>
<p>our deplorable situation. We certainly never have contributed therein
</p>
<p>by our conduct; The English on their part never gave us occasion.
</p>
<p>Instruct us what we can do; We look upon you as Protectors and Media

</p>

<p>tied together, with ropes, they would do, gel across the vessel and cer-
</p>
<p>tainly set her on fire, and at the same time directing the Indians, showing
</p>
<p>them how the Outawas made their rafts; which were then finished a
</p>
<p>little lower down: and waiting for the Chippewas, sending down theirs.
</p>
<p>This Frenchman Mr. Fisher says lives on the other side of the Creek in
</p>
<p>which the Outawas made (heir rafts, and is said by Isaac Trueax and
</p>
<p>Gerrit Teller to be one Miloss. Mr. Fisher further says that soon after
</p>
<p>the attack of Capt. Dalyell he was with his Indian Father at the Bouse
</p>
<p>of one Cardinal, the son of the old Cardinal. & beared him tell his Father
</p>
<p>and many other Indians with a tone full of ectasy & joy that the English
</p>
<p>had in that affair many killed and wounded, that they were lying here
</p>
<p>and there Dead in the Fields and that a Woman who had been in the
</p>
<p>Fort, of whom the Major had asked news regarding that affair, told him;
</p>
<p>she said there was but few Indians, that the Cardinal said to the Indians.
</p>
<p>that was true, for had you been all there few of them would escape, tell-
</p>
<p>ing them at the same time that the Major had said that he would whip
</p>
<p>them all like beasts out of the ground with a horse whip. At which
</p>
<p>expression the Indians laughed very much, as if disdaining all threats.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher further says that he was one day with his Indian father in
</p>
<p>a Frenchman's house, where there had been several Indians and one
</p>
<p>Gabriel a Frenchman, who lives where the Outawas encamped the time
</p>
<p>Capt. Dalyell made his attack, that he heard the said Gabriel & the
</p>
<p>Indians talk about having sent to the Fort for pipes. & the Indians toll-
</p>
<p>ing him Gabriel that the Commanding officer had sent them word he
</p>
<p>knew not of their pipes, nor had he any, upon which this Gabriel got up
</p>
<p>and gave the Indian hoop or holloe, saying he was a man. & that he never
</p>
<p>threw away or lost a pipe, the Indians then answering the hoop, he
</p>
<p>Gabriel went out.
</p>
<p>Andreas Trueax and Mr. Fisher both say that the same Gabriel had
</p>
<p>told them, that when the French and Indians had spoke at any time to
</p>
<p>the Major, he called them Hogs and other names, telling them to gett
</p>
<p>along and go about their business & would not hear them. Mr. Fisher
</p>
<p>further declares that one Tom, a servant of Mr. Knaggs's, who was
</p>
<p>prisoner at the same lime told him. Mr. Andreas and Mr. Isaac Trueax,

</p>
<p>told Pondiac thai thei would no1 fighl with him against the English, as

<p>to join him and 6gh1 against the English. Kenbarger told him of this

<p>they were all readj and willing to take up arms with him against the

<p>tell it him yourself. Thai on Jadocs hearing the result of this Council
</p>
<p>he came to Pero Potie, the Jesuil and prevailed upon him to come to the

<p>paton, two Inhabitants of the For, had often gone out an g8< the Sav-
</p>
<p>ages and told everywhere thai the English in the Fort were half Dead
</p>
<p>and that a good savage cry would make thorn surrender; Further .hat
</p>
<p>Currie, Sckieott, Meny Chene, Godfrey and others knew of the Plan to

<p>murder the Garrison in Council several days before it was attempted to
</p>
<p>be put into execution; and thai by the requests of Curie, Campeau and

<p>told Jadoc that Currie had also desired of Pondiac to sav,. Cap1 Hop

<p>and Meny Chene, which on reading surprised him so much thai In- asked

<p>you'll see no English there, we will take it eer that time. Jadoc then

<p>replied, how will you take it. We will take it by sapp replied Campeau,

<p>further that Tiffoc, who came in the Fall from the Illinois and positively

<p>declared to all the Savages there was no Peace that it was all a lie &

<p>there would he an army soon from the Illinois with ammunition enough;

<p>trying to open the door, challenged him and desired if he would go out
</p>
<p>to take the Indian along with him. The Deponant further says thai he

<p>he conversed as above. p U 1 confidence in Labadie who had asked him it' la-
</p>
<p>knew the Indians to have got money in their plunders with some other

</p>
<p>some Watches, anil then consulted him about making his escape, thai he
</p>
<p>told him it was impossible if could not swim, pointing to the River,
</p>
<p>which trust he is certain prevented his getting off that: night by the
</p>
<p>vigilance of Labadie & likewise believes was the occasion of his being
</p>
<p>carried away next day to Sagama, where in his way lie met with John
</p>
<p>Edwards a Soldier & Prisoner to whom he related the circumstam
</p>
<p>in this Deposition. The Deponant further declares thai he saw Labadie

<p>been also taken at Presqu-isle. And that he further knows the said

<p>Labadie to have received spades shovels ami other utensils belonging to

<p>give him a kick with her foot and told him in English to move aside, and
</p>
<p>that the husband of that woman was one of the men dressed and painted

</p>
<p>The circumstances in the Deposition of McConnie with regard to the
</p>
<p>being laid open by the Enemy's false keys appears to be true, as
</p>
<p>there were three large keys found within the Fori sometime after hid
</p>
<p>under ground exactly the same make with the real keys of the Fort
</p>
<p>and answering locks equally well. McConnie being asked how he knew
</p>
<p>Labadie to be the Person he had seen Painting the Young Men &Cc

<p>Answers he has often since he came from the Savages, therefore knows

<p>him perfectly well; being asked who were the young men he saw him

<p>said 6th March, thai one Predome an Inhabitant abused him for stop-

<p>pin- some young Frenchmen (forced bj Pondiac) from attacking the Ves-

<p>they would be angry with them if they did not strike the English and

<p>that of the prohibition of rum and that the English took six Raccoons

</p>
<p>Frenchmen) at three in the morning some Indians came by there with a

<p>licit inviting all nations of Indians they met to fall upon the English,
</p>
<p>wherever they found them. That they sung the War Song in Mi-. Mas-

<p>Massac sung with them & when he struck his stroke in the song he struck

<p>with a little loaf of Bread. Thai one Dunoir and one Campeau was

<p>have killed them, & he was sorn for his fault. Clermont then told him

<p>them thai he was in Council with Pondiac there. That Mr. Deneyon

<p>told him he was glad to see him & hoped that his sences were come to

<p>him. Pondiac then took a large Bell and laid it before him saying, My

<p>June 10th, 1764.
</p>
<p>This day Teata, a Wiandotl Chief of this Place, arrived herefrom San-
</p>
<p>dusky where he had been to carry Sir William Johnson's Speech, who
</p>
<p>says that after he delivered il and Iefl it to their Deliberation, The Greal
</p>
<p>Chief (Big Jaw) got up and thanked him for the trouble he had been at to
</p>
<p>bring it and immediately the whole wenl out. After he had delivered
</p>
<p>tne s l ch he says he advised them to come to their senses, but in case
</p>
<p>they did not it was their affair. Four days after they came back and
</p>
<p>desired Teata to come and hear what they had to say' in answer. The
</p>
<p>first Belt they pave him was a repetition of Sir Williams speech. Then
</p>
<p>they took another. Savin- Sr William asks the reason why we struck
</p>
<p>against the English, we think he ought to knew better than anybody;
</p>
<p>yes said they, it is Sr William that ought to know, but since the Senecas
</p>
<p>have made Peace with him, and the English, tell him it was them thai
</p>
<p>just embroiled the Earth and were the first cause of what has been done.
</p>
<p>Gave a Belt. They then took another Belt and said. Sr. William and the
</p>
<p>Six Nations want that we should own our folly and find words to excuse
</p>
<p>ourselves that we may be again set right. You'll tell him by this Belt
</p>
<p>which you are charged to deliver to him that lor what is past is past,
</p>
<p>that we have yet done no harm since last summer, we have kept our
</p>
<p>i'oung Men quiet for which reason we think the breach may be easily
</p>
<p>mended; and tell him also we shall keep them quiet this summer when
</p>
<p>we think we shall be reconciled. The two Mohawks who are come witli
</p>
<p>Teata say that they were told by the Ilurons of Sandusky that they
</p>
<p>would not tell Teata the result of a Council they had had with the Shaw
</p>
<p>nees, which was that they were to try to take Fort Pitt by Treachery,
</p>
<p>and if they failed there, were to go against the Inhabitants on the Pron
</p>
<p>tier. One of them further says that before lie left the ] tela wares Towns
</p>
<p>he saw thirty small parties go out who were all intend to go to our fron-
</p>
<p>tiers. They both also say that the Hurous at Sandusky laughed at Teata
</p>
<p>behind his back and (tilled him fool for believing what Sir William said
</p>
<p>and bringing such a message. That tho he said they should be friends,
</p>
<p>it can never be mil ill all the English, except Traders, go from this Place,
</p>
<p>meaning Detroit, and then we believe we shall agree. That their tied

<p>hawk us the next day. That the English always told them they had as

<p>many men as there were leaves on the trees; but we look upon one Indian

<p>as good as a thousand of them, anil notwithstanding we are but mice in

</p>
<p>sorry thai Sir \\ illiam Johnson was coming here, as they imagined
</p>
<p>by that, he wanted to have his Bones here. They also say that, while they
</p>
<p>were at the Shawaney Village, the French from the Mississippi sent
</p>
<p>them a Presenl of Powder, of which thej saw three Barrels. That the
</p>
<p>Onondagoes whom Sir William sent against the Shawanies came to one
</p>
<p>of these \ Mages, where they were asked what they came for; they said
</p>
<p>we come to scalp you ; Then one Kayoughshoutong said, here, take these,
</p>
<p>giving them two old scalps, that he had newly painted, go home and tell
</p>
<p>Sir William yon have scalped two Shawanese; upon which they returned,
</p>
<p>that the above mentioned Indian was the cause of their not striking
</p>
<p>against the shawanese. I'.ni it was not so wit h the Tuscororsco for they
</p>
<p>lost three men. Mr. St. .Martin, Interpreter, told Col. Gladwin several
</p>
<p>Times, that the Burons of this Place, told him, that if Feace was made

<p>with the Delawares, Shawanese and Burons of Sandusky that it would

<p>be neither g 1 nor lasting.

<p>running inwards the House for Shelter and the Indians after him, but as

</p>
<p>you must erect no more Forts on our Ground. Brs when ye went to take

<p>Possession of Fort Detroit, we cautioned you against it ; we told you the
</p>
<p>Indians inhabiting that pari of the Country were not well, but ill (lis
</p>
<p>posed towards you, which you have since found to ho true. Yr tirsf work
</p>
<p>when you arrived there was to build a Fort; this none of us liked, and
</p>
<p>that was one Chief Reason for our entering into a War against you, as

<p>we had sufficient reason to Hunk you intended taking our country from

<p>Sir: This will be delivered you by < 'olonel Bouquet  Who has the com
</p>
<p>mand of a detachment, consisting of 400 men of the Lsl Batn R. A. R.
</p>
<p>under Majr Walters, for the relief of Niagra, and of LOO Virginians to
</p>
<p>take Post at Presque Isle.
</p>
<p>By a copy of Genl. Amherst's letter to you, I find, sir, that immediately
</p>
<p>upon the arrival of the Americans at Presque Isle, you are to embark and
</p>
<p>transport them across the Lake. But as I have not as yet been able to
</p>
<p>get up any of the Pensilvaniae Provincials, in time to inarch with this
</p>
<p>detachment; (though I expect some in this day) and the 100 Virginians
</p>
<p>may not be sufficient to keep that Post, till the arrival of the Pensil-
</p>
<p>vanians, (which I am hopeful will be at Presque Isle in two days after
</p>
<p>this detachment as 1 shall send them off immediately) I should be glad,
</p>
<p>if it would be of no detriment to the service, thai 150 or less, of the
</p>
<p>Americans, or of your own detachment, might be left  I think for two
</p>
<p>days almost  till the arrival of the reinforcement. The more so as 1
</p>
<p>suppose they will he able to join you. before you can get your whale
</p>
<p>boats back across the carrying place. This you will consult upon with
</p>
<p>Colonel Bouquet, who is to fix that Post. Besides, sir, the boats that
</p>
<p>will take them after you, may be those you are directed to leave by the
</p>
<p> iiiils instructions to you, for keeping up the communication between
</p>
<p>Niagra and Presque Isle.
</p>
<p>1 should be glad, sir, of your remarks on the distance of your crossing
</p>
<p>the Lake, of any harbours or creeks, you may have put into, and of the

<p>shore; likewise of the situation of the ground where the French store

<p>LETTER FROM SIR JEFFERY AMHERST TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.
</p>
<p>New York. 17 Sept, i7<;:i.
</p>
<p>Sir: As there have been two Deputy Adjutants general serving here,
</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty to show a mark of my entire satisfaction of
</p>
<p>Major Gladwin's good conduct, and commendable behaviour, in appoint-
</p>
<p>ing him a D. Adjt. General; but to remain with the troops a1 the Detroit
</p>
<p>in the same manner as has been ordered: (his is no more than a name,
</p>
<p>but it should be . . . gracious pleasure to approve it, and honor
</p>
<p>Major Gladwin with the rank of Lieut. Colonel, I am firmly of opinion
</p>
<p>that the promotion of so deserving an officer must at any time be a bene-
</p>
<p>fit to his Majesty's service, and it is the sole view I have in mentioning
</p>
<p>it to you.
</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with the most perfed regard,
</p>
<p>Sir,
</p>
<p>Ye
</p>
<p>Jeff: Amherst.

</p>
<p>Detroit, November i, 1763.
</p>
<p>Sir: On the 12th Oct. the enemy sued for peace in a very submissive
</p>
<p>manner. At that time I was so circumstanced for want of flour that 1
</p>
<p>must cither pass or hear them. Of the two 1 chose the latter, thinking it
</p>
<p>of the utmost consequence to keep possession of the country. Neverthe
</p>
<p>less, 1 made them no promises. I told them the affair of peace lay wholly
</p>
<p>in your breast, but I did not doubt when you was thoroughly convinced
</p>
<p>of their sincerity everything would be well again; upon which hostility

<p>The tenor of thai of Pondiac is s ething extraordinary. The Indians are

<p>preparing for peace. I enclose you my answer to their demands.

<p>I believe as things are circumstanced i1 would be for the good of his

</p>
<p>imagine there will be anj danger of their breaking out again, provided
</p>
<p>Home examples are made of their good subjects, the French, who set them
</p>
<p>on. No advantages can be gained by prosecuting the war, owing to the
</p>
<p>difficulty of catching them. Add to this the expense of such a war.
</p>
<p>which if continued the entire ruin of our peltry trade must follow, and
</p>
<p>i In- less of a prodiguous consumption of our merchandise. It will be the
</p>
<p>neaiis of their retiring, which will reinforce other nations on the Missis
</p>
<p>sippi. whom they will push againsl us, and make them our enemies for
</p>
<p>ever. Consequently they will render it extremely difficult, if not impos
</p>
<p>silile, for us to pass that country. And especially the French have pro
</p>
<p>mised to supply them with everything they want.
</p>
<p>The\ have hist between eighty and ninety of their best warriors, but if
</p>
<p>your Excellency si ill intends to punish them further for their barbarities,
</p>
<p>it rnaj I asilj dune, without any expense to the Crown, by permitting
</p>
<p>sale of rum, which will destroy them more effectually than fire and
</p>
<p>sword, bu1 on the contrary, it' you intend to accomodate matters in
</p>
<p>Spring, which I hope you will for i he aboi e reasons, it may be necessary
</p>
<p>to semi up Sir William Johnson.
</p>
<p>I shall write your Excellency fully concerning everything in this
</p>
<p>department li\ Lieutenant Montressor. This comes by Aren, a Mohawk,
</p>
<p>whom I shall direel to wait at Fori Pitt for your answer.
</p>
<p>This moment 1 received a message from Pondiac, telling me that he
</p>
<p>Bhould send to all the nations concerned in the war to bury the hatchet,
</p>
<p>and he hopes j  Excellency will forget what is passed. If not, I believe
</p>
<p>lie \\ ill retire to the Mississippi.

<p>/'< bruary, 24, 1774.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir: Your most obliging letter of the 9th instani did not com.- to
</p>
<p>hand (ill two days ago. The cover was wry dirty and worn out, there
</p>
<p>fore I conclude that either your servant or mine by mistake had kepi i1
</p>
<p>in his pocket for a week; I wrote to Meyrick yesterday to send me down
</p>
<p>a letter of attorney, and desired him that if he met with any difficulties
</p>
<p>to apply to you,not doubting yourgood offices. I am prone to thank youfor
</p>
<p>your friendly and good advise, and I begin tothiulc lam asbada politician
</p>
<p>as a courtier. To give you an instance of the former latter. When I was
</p>
<p>presented to I he king to 1 hank him for the rank he gave rue, I was asked
</p>
<p>how long I had been in town. I replied, "three weeks." George Won.
</p>
<p>who stood at my elbow, told me I should have said just arrived, Ian as I
</p>
<p>weut to Court only upon that occasion, and thought it probable thai I
</p>
<p>should never go there again, I conceived there was no harm in speaking
</p>
<p>i ho i ruth.
</p>
<p>In regard to my politics you find me jusl as I loft you in America,
</p>
<p>which may suffice to show you that I am not calculated to push myself in
</p>
<p>the world. Besides I am now engaged in another scene, being very happy
</p>
<p>in a good . . . wife and two little children, upon a small paternal
</p>
<p>estate, and am fond of farming and rural amusements. As to company,
</p>
<p>I keep but little, because I cannot afford to live in the stile of my neigh
</p>
<p>bours. Nevertheless I am happy content. From this account of myself,
</p>
<p>1 daresay you will riot be surprised when I tell you thai 1 should prefer
</p>
<p>a small sinecure governmenl at homo to all future expectations in the
</p>
<p>army. 1 should be satisfied with anything that would better my income

<p>ir frontier inhabitants hare fell the good effects of it, they never

<p>will enter into such ;i war again, with that confidence they engaged in

<p>i his. which I believe they would not have undertaken, but for our good
</p>
<p>subjects the French.
</p>
<p>I Lave had no late accounts from below, the last I received from the

<p>General is of the 2nd of July, in which I am ordered to establish the out-
</p>
<p>immediately, at the time I received these orders, I knew it was
</p>
<p>impossible to comply with any part of them, the event shows I was right

<p>in my conjectures. I am heartily wearied of my command and I have

<p>signified the same to Colonel Amherst, 1 hope I shall be relieved soon, if

<p>not, I intend to quil the service for 1 would not chuse to be any longer
