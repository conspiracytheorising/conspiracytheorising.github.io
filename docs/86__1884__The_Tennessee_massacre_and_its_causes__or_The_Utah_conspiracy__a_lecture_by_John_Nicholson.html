<p>I NT ROI)UCTORY.
</p>
<p>THE circumstances which led to the giving of this lecture
</p>
<p>in the Salt Lake Theatre are as follows:
</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson, by special request of Bishop IE. B. Clawson,
</p>
<p>delivered an address under a similar title in the Twelfth Ward
</p>
<p>Assembly Rooms, on the 14th of September, 1884.
</p>
<p>The
</p>
<p>impression created by it was such as to result in the annex d
</p>
<p>correspondence:
</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY,
</p>
<p>September 17, 1881.
</p>
<p>John Nicholson, Esq.,
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:-The address delivered by you on the 14th
</p>
<p>inst, in the Twelfth Ward Assembly Rooms. on the subject of
</p>
<p>the recent massacre of "Mormon" } lders in Tennessee, and the
</p>
<p>causes whioh led to that fearful tragedy, having created a deep
</p>
<p>interest in the community, and a desire on the part of very many
</p>
<p>who were prevented from being present upon that occasion to
</p>
<p>hear the facts you have in your possession, we, the undersigned,
</p>
<p>being of the opinion that a more widespread underttanding of
</p>
<p>the circumstances which surround this tragedy, and which led
</p>
<p>to its perpetration will be of public benefit, respectfully request
</p>
<p>that you repeat the lecture, or deliver one of a similar nature at
</p>
<p>as early a date as will be convenient to you.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving an intimation from you that a compliance with
</p>
<p>our request will be agreeable to you, and the date that will be
</p>
<p>convenient to you to give the lecture, we will take the necessary
</p>
<p>steps to secure a larger building than the Twelfth Ward Assembly Rooms, and to give suitable notice to the public.
</p>
<p>Very respectfully,
</p>

<p>THE RESPONSE.
</p>
<p>To the Hon. Wm. Jennings and others.
</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN:-In response to your request that I
</p>
<p>should deliver, in some large hall to be secured by you for the
</p>
<p>purpose, an address similar to that lately given in the Twelfth
</p>
<p>Ward Assembly Rooms, I have to say that, although personally
</p>
<p>reluctant to place myself so conspicuously before the public, I
</p>
<p>will endeavor to comply with your wish. I suggest Monday
</p>
<p>night, tept. z2nd, as suitable for the occasion, if that time is
</p>
<p>agreeable with your convenience.
</p>
<p>Yours respectfully,
</p>
<p>JOHN NICHOLSON.
</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, Sept. 17th, 1884.
</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CI1Y,
</p>
<p>September 18, 1884.
</p>
<p>John Nicholson, Esq.,
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR:-Referring to your response of yesterday,
</p>
<p>wherein you express a willingness to repeat your lecture on the
</p>
<p>'Tennessee Massacre and Causes Leading Thereto," or one of a
</p>
<p>similar nature, the business of securing a suitable hall having
</p>
<p>been considered, we beg to state that we have obtained the Salt
</p>
<p>Lake Theatre for Monday evening, Sept. 22nd, for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Very respectfully,
</p>
<p>William Jennings, I. Dinwoodey, David James, Thomas G.
</p>
<p>Webber, A. Miner, John Clark and others.
</p>
<p>THE APPEARANCE OF THE THEATRE.
</p>
<p>The appealance of the Theatre on the occasion is thus
</p>
<p>described by Mr. O. F. Whitney, of the Deserct News:
</p>
<p>"Probably the most densely packed audience ever within the
</p>
<p>walls of the Salt Lake Theatre, was seen there last evening at
</p>
<p>the lecture of Mr. John Nicholson on the Tennessee Massacre and its Causes.' The doors were thrown open at 7 o'clock,
</p>
<p>as announced, and an eager multitude at once thronged into
</p>
<p>the building. By the time the lecture was to begin, 8 o'clock,
</p>
<p>it is safe to say that there was not a seat left untaken, and

</p>
<p>hundreds were standing up, not alone in the lower part of the
</p>
<p>house, but in every circle as well. It was truly a magnificent
</p>
<p>sight.
</p>
<p>INTRO D UCTOR Y.

</p>
<p>"Nor did the stage present a less splendid appearance. As
</p>
<p>soon as the curtain rose, as it did promptly on the hour, it was
</p>
<p>discovered that there was a second audience facing the one
</p>
<p>which crammed the auditorium. Manager ('la wsn, who is an
</p>
<p>adept at such things, had caused the whole stage to be shut in,
</p>
<p>with the exception of entrances at the wings and rear, with
</p>
<p>handsome scenery, while the entire avai'able space was filled
</p>
<p>with chairs, all of them taken, and many more would-be occupants left standing. No less than three or four hundred people were on the stage alone. The surprise awakened at the
</p>
<p>sight found vent in a burst of applause from those in front.
</p>
<p>Before this however, the Theatre Orchestra, under Professor
</p>
<p>Thomas, who were in their accustomed place, had rendered
</p>
<p>some nice selections, and the Sixteenth Ward Band, in full
</p>
<p>uniform, upon the stage, between the curtain and footlights,
</p>
<p>had supplemented the same with repeated executions in like
</p>
<p>excellent style."
</p>
<p>HON. WILLIAM JENNI.NGS
</p>
<p>then approached the footlights and said: Ladies and
</p>
<p>gentlemen: before introducing the lecturer, I would like to
</p>
<p>say that there has been a report on the street this afternoon
</p>
<p>that there would be a cry of fire made here to night, to disturb this audience. If such a thing should occur as a cry of
</p>
<p>fire, I hope you will take no notice of it, but keep your seats
</p>
<p>and all will be right.
</p>
<p>I take pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, in introducing to you
</p>
<p>Mr. John Nicholson, who will lecture upon 'The Tennessee
</p>
<p>Massacre and Its Causes." [Applause.]
</p>
<p>MR NtIHOLSON
</p>
<p>stepped forward and was received with loud applause. He
</p>
<p>then delivered the following
</p>

</p>
<p>already announced the subject upon which I propose to treat;
</p>
<p>6i
</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>therefore, it is unnecessary for me to repeat it. As you may
</p>
<p>well suppo e, it is no small matter for a man to occupy the
</p>
<p>position that I do to-night before this vast audience. I trust
</p>
<p>that you will bear with me in patience until I shall concentrate
</p>
<p>my thoughts upon the task that lies before me.
</p>
<p>The subjtct, you will at once admit, is one of absorbing
</p>
<p>interest, not only to this community of which we form a part,
</p>
<p>lut it has created an interest all over this nation and many
</p>
<p>other parts of the world besides. Perhaps before proceeding
</p>
<p>to the discussion of the causes that produced the horrible
</p>
<p>massacre which sent a thrill 'through this entire community,
</p>
<p>and also caused a feeling of regret among all good and upright
</p>
<p>people who have learned the details of the murder-it would
</p>
<p>be well, in the first place, to give a brief
</p>
<p>NARRATIVE (F THIE TRAGEDY
</p>
<p>itself. As is the custom with the Elders of the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Clhurch, Elders W. S. B, rry and Henry Thompson, who were
</p>
<p>laboring as missionaries in the State of Tennessee, and more
</p>
<p>especially in Lewis County of that State, made an appointment to hold a meeting and preach their views to the people.
</p>
<p>That meeting was appointed for 11 o'clock, on the 10th day of
</p>
<p>August, 1884, at the house of James Condor, on Cane Ceek,
</p>
<p>Lewis County, Tennessee. A short time previous to the filling
</p>
<p>of that appointment, the Elders whom I have named were
</p>
<p>unexpectedly joined by two others, Elders John H. Gibbs
</p>
<p>and William H. Jones. On the day appointed, three of the
</p>
<p>Elders-with Elder Jones excepted, he being at the house of
</p>
<p>Mr. Garrett, a short distance from the Condor farmassembled at Mr. Condor's habitation and engaged in preliminary exercises, such as the singing of r ligious hymns and
</p>
<p>preparing their minds for the devotions in which they were
</p>
<p>shortly to engage.
</p>
<p>Elder Jones, at Mr. Garrett's house, wa. engaged in reading a discourse of one of the authorities of the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church, for the instruction and edification of a number of
</p>
<p>people who had assembled there. After he had concluded

</p>
<p>this, he inamediately started on his way to join the others
</p>
<p>AND ITS CA USES.
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>who were at Condor's; but while he was traversing that short
</p>
<p>distance, suddenly a mob of men, in fantastic garbs and
</p>
<p>masked faces, and armed and equipped with deadly weapons
</p>
<p>for the commission of violence, rushed upon him and made
</p>
<p>him a prisoner. Suffice it to say, without entering into the
</p>
<p>details to far as he is concerned, for you are more or less
</p>
<p>familiar with them, he was left in charge of one of this
</p>
<p>armed party, and that guard that was left over him received
</p>
<p>instructions from his brother mobocrats that he should, on the
</p>
<p>first intimation of any attempt to escape, shoot him down like
</p>
<p>a dog-that he should be murdered. You are already aware
</p>
<p>that Elder Jones, by the consent and connivance of his guard,
</p>
<p>escaped and survives, and has returned to his home and his
</p>
<p>friends in Utah.
</p>
<p>On leaving Elder Jones, the mob proceeded to the house
</p>
<p>of Mr. Condor. They found the proprietor of the place standing by the gate. They made him a prisoner. James Condor
</p>
<p>knew the business of that mob who had come with covered
</p>
<p>faces armed to the teeth. He knew that they had come to
</p>
<p>take the lives of the Elders from Utah, and in order that
</p>
<p>these Elders might be defended he called to his boys who
</p>
<p>were in the garden-his son and step-son-to go and get their
</p>
<p>guns to defend the lives of these men who were under his
</p>
<p>protection because under his roof. After the seizure of James
</p>
<p>Condor, David Hinson, who appeared to be the leader of the
</p>
<p>mob, entered the house where Elder Gibbs was engaged in
</p>
<p>selecting texts of scripture for the purpose of enabling him
</p>
<p>to preach the doctrines that are taught in the Bible. He took
</p>
<p>a gun that was hanging upon the hooks down from over the
</p>
<p>back door, and with that weapon, in cold blood, shot Elder
</p>
<p>Gibbs down-murdered him! Next this deadly weapon was
</p>
<p>presented at Henry Thompson, whose life he also sought.
</p>
<p>Elder Berry being close at hand a man of indomitable
</p>
<p>courage and powerful nerve-desirous of saving his brother,
</p>
<p>seized the weapon and held it as if it were in the grip of a

</p>
<p>vise, and turned it away from the person of his fellow missionary. At the same moment Elder Berry observed others
</p>
<p>of the mobocrats enter the front door with their weapons
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>leveled upon him, and when he saw that, and feeling that
</p>
<p>his doom was sealed, he simply bowed his head and received
</p>
<p>the bullets of the assassins in his body and fell dead at their
</p>
<p>feet. Elder Thompson saw that to remain longer was to
</p>
<p>needlessly sacrifice another life, and therefore he made his
</p>
<p>escape. As he passed out of the house and was leaving it his
</p>
<p>life wou'd have been taken also, only there intervened betwixt
</p>
<p>him and the would-be assassin the person of a lady who
</p>
<p>passed out of the house and was about to lift her child from
</p>
<p>the ground, and Elder Thompson escaped to the woods. In
</p>
<p>the meantime, Martin Condor, the son of James Condor,
</p>
<p>entered the house and engaged in a struggle with David Hinson for the possession of the weapon that he held, and while
</p>
<p>engaged in this struggle some other members of the mob shot
</p>
<p>him down and murdered him. In the meantime, J. R. Hudson, the step-son of James Condor, entered and leaped up into
</p>
<p>the loft of the house to procure a gun, and descended as quick
</p>
<p>as thought, almost. Ile was seized at the foot of the stairs by
</p>
<p>two of the murderous ruffians but tearing himself loose he
</p>
<p>shot and killed David Hinson, and then he in turn was slain
</p>
<p>also, making five dead men, four whose blood was guiltless,
</p>
<p>and one of the guilty murderers, who went into eternity with
</p>
<p>the blood of innocence upon his hands.
</p>
<p>Not satisfied with their diabolical work, thus far, these
</p>
<p>fiends incarnate, before leaving the premises, as an after-piece
</p>
<p>to the tragedy, poured a volley through the window, a number
</p>
<p>of the missiles of death entering and severely wounding the
</p>
<p>person of an innocent woman Mrs. Condor, the mother of the
</p>
<p>two murdered boys, and the balance of the bullets entered the
</p>
<p>dead body of W. S. Berry.
</p>
<p>A CONSPIRACY IN UTAH.
</p>
<p>You will agree with me that this was horrible work, and
</p>
<p>that those upon whom rests any degree of responsibility for
</p>
<p>its consummation have a great deal to answer for. It is my
</p>
<p>purpose to show where at least a portion of that responsibility
</p>
<p>lies. I think before we get through to-night, that it will be

</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>the peace, and good order, and well-being of the great majority
</p>
<p>of the people who inhabit this fair Territory. and that that
</p>
<p>conspiracy has its headquarters in Salt Lake City. I propose
</p>
<p>to give you the evidence, and I do not propose to be one-s:ded
</p>
<p>in its production, fr the conspirators shall furnish ir themselves.
</p>
<p>On the 7th day of May, 1882, in the Methodist Church of
</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, I attended a meeting. It was a gathering of
</p>
<p>rather an unusual character. It was one among ten thousand
</p>
<p>meetings; so the presiding genius therc-the Rev. L A.
</p>
<p>Rudisill -stated; for that particular 7th day of May, 1882,
</p>
<p>had been set aside and consecrated for the purpose of working
</p>
<p>up a prejudice against the "Mormon" community-of inflaming the minds of the people of this nation against an innocent
</p>
<p>people who dwell in this Territory.
</p>
<p>But I wish you to understand that it was not altogether or
</p>
<p>purely a religious meeting. It was also political. There is a
</p>
<p>great deal said in this community, by certain parties, about
</p>
<p>the amalgamation of church and state. It is very objectionable to them, except, of course, when they engage in it themselves; then it is perfectly right. The conspiracy to which I
</p>
<p>now allude, is not only of a religious character, but also political. There was there in all his bloom,- lis Excellency,
</p>
<p>Governor Eli H. Murray, Judge John R McBride, Judge
</p>
<p>Jacob S. Boreman, and Mr. J. F. Bradley. They represented,
</p>

</p>
<p>In speaking to the audience assembled on that occasion,

<p>Mr. Rudisill stated that the Methodists had always occupied

<p>Congress was compelled to pass the Edmunds law. Note the

<p>word compelled. My memory does not fail me in regard to

<p>the details of that meeting. He said compelled. But the

</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>His Excellency, the Governor, stated that the Edmunds
</p>
<p>law was a step in the right direction, but it was far from being
</p>
<p>satisfactory.
</p>
<p>Judge John R. McBride stated that on that particular
</p>
<p>occasion he felt as if he was an excellent Methodist. [Laughter
</p>
<p>and applause.] It is generally understood in the community
</p>
<p>I believe, that he is no religionist of any kind. He has a
</p>
<p>perfect right to take that position, and every man has a right
</p>
<p>of this kind, be the position what it may. But in one particular John R. McBride seems to conform somewhat to
</p>
<p>scriptural requirements; for it has been said by Paul that we
</p>
<p>should "be all things to all men." [Applause] It appears that
</p>
<p>this conspirator is willing to be a devout Methodist, or anything else, so long as he can accomplish the object nearest
</p>
<p>his heart-suppression of ''Mormonism"-[applause] orrather
</p>
<p>the taking away of the political power out of the hands of the
</p>
<p>majority of the people of Utah, for that is the political part
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy. He further s'ated that in order to reach
</p>
<p>the 'Mormons," one legal provision, especially, should be
</p>
<p>eliminat d from the statute books-that provision which prevents a woman from testifying against her husband. He also
</p>
<p>had the effrontery in that meeting to say that he felt that he
</p>
<p>would make an excellent prosecutor of the "Mormon" Church
</p>
<p>if he were appointed to that office. [Applause and laughter.]
</p>
<p>It does not need a very great change to insert the correct word,
</p>
<p>and make it persecutor of the "Mormon" Church. [Laughter].
</p>
<p>Mr. Boreman, or rather Judge Boreman-I hope he will
</p>
<p>pardon me for forgetting his title-[laughter and applause]
</p>
<p>when I consider how little he is entitled to it, I think it is
</p>
<p>very pardonable. I cannot tell you very well what Judge
</p>
<p>Boreman did say, it was so absurd. He seemed to be in a
</p>
<p>passion worked up to a remarkable degree. He said someth;ng about the people who belonged to the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church in England desiring to' proclaim Brigham Young
</p>
<p>king, and a lot of nonsense of that kind. If anybody had
</p>
<p>asked me what I thought about his speech on that occasion
</p>
<p>when the religious and political'conspirators met together, I

</p>

</p>
<p>cription that was given by a student wh(n he was asked to
</p>
<p>state his opinion of a speech of a fellow student. He said it
</p>
<p>was "an heterogeneous concatenation of extraneous plraseology." [Laughter and applause.
</p>
<p>Mr. 'Bradley did not make out much better in this connection than our frend, Mr. Boreman. His speech was about
</p>
<p>as unintelligible; it was not edifying, especially' to me,
</p>
<p>although I was glad I was present for your sakes, ladies and
</p>
<p>gentlemen, who were not there, that I night tell you what
</p>
<p>took place.
</p>
<p>There are some others whom I wish to bring to your
</p>
<p>attention, for.l desire to show you to-night that there has been
</p>
<p>a systematic, determined purpose put in operation. to spread
</p>
<p>throughj'this country, as far as their influence could reach,
</p>
<p>the most infamous, scandalous fabrications that'could possibly
</p>
<p>be conceived in the brains of human beings, that under cover
</p>
<p>of a"prejudice thus created, the design' of thel conspirators
</p>
<p>might be accomplished.
</p>
<p>I draw your attention to the case of the Rev. R. G.
</p>
<p>McNiece.:who is 'very 'anxious about the welfare of this community;'~exceedingly so. Not very long-since he presented in
</p>
<p>the Independent, a very influential journal published in the
</p>
<p>East, his views, or what purported to be h;s views, on the
</p>
<p>"V ormon" question, and you may be sure he did not wish to
</p>
<p>paint the "Mormon" community in favorable colors. He
</p>
<p>wanted to make the impression upon the country, through the
</p>
<p>medium of the Independent, that the "Mormons" are a lawless, murderous, vile community of wretches, that should not
</p>
<p>be p rmitted to live. As evidence that they should be roabbed
</p>
<p>of their rights, or ihat all political power should be taken away
</p>
<p>from them, he stated that his fellow religionists in Utah had
</p>
<p>been placed in great jeopardy through the buildings that they
</p>
<p>occupied and their churches being stoned and set on fire, and
</p>
<p>in consequence of this the lives, these valuable lives, of himself and fellow religionists had been placed in jeopardy. Of

<p>course it was the "Mormons" who committed these outrages.
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSAC(RE
</p>
<p>When his attention was drawn to his perfidy through a
</p>
<p>public journal of this city, he cited a number of alleged
</p>
<p>instances to sustain the statements which he had made. But
</p>
<p>before I proceed any further, I wish to say now that his statements in the hidependent were endorsed by some of the
</p>
<p>political conspirators, Judge Rosborough, Judge Jacob S.
</p>
<p>Boreman and one of the editors of the Scdt Lake Tr;ib/ne,
</p>
<p>Colonel Nelson, for the chief editor was at that time in Washington, supposedly fur the purpose, under cover of the prejudice
</p>
<p>already created against the "Mormons," of procuring legislation to rob the "Mormons" of their political rights. I think
</p>
<p>that any st.itemnnt made by the Rev. McNiece certainly needs
</p>
<p>endorsing [laughter] as I propose to show. tie cited as an
</p>
<p>instance of his truthfulness that about eighteen months previous, in the city of Logan, an attempt had been made to
</p>
<p>burn the Presbyterian Church of that town. The facts in
</p>
<p>regard to that circumstance were these: On the 30th day of
</p>
<p>November, 1882. a church sociable was held in that building,
</p>
<p>the Rev. Mr. Parks presiding, and there broke in upon the
</p>
<p>harmony of the occasion an individual by the name of
</p>
<p>William Buder, a non-"Mormon," and presumably a member
</p>
<p>of the "liberal" party. He was in a state of beastly intoxication. Ile desired to be admitted into this church sociable,
</p>
<p>and forced his way into the building. The Rev. Mr. Parks,
</p>
<p>who seems to believe a little in muscular Christianity-and I
</p>
<p>do not blame him-tonk him neck and crop and bundled him
</p>
<p>out [applause] just as he should have done. But William
</p>
<p>Buder, a non-"Mormon," said to the Rev. Parks, "I'll get
</p>
<p>even with you." On that same night, at a late hour, an
</p>
<p>attempt was made to set the building on fire, and the subsequent investigation, according to all the circums'ances discoverable after a close scrutiny, pointed to William Buder as the
</p>
<p>would-be incendiary. Mr. Parks believed it was William
</p>
<p>Buder, a non-"Mormon," who had sought in that way to get
</p>
<p>even with him, and so did everybody else familiar with the
</p>
<p>facts, and I do not know but what Mr. McNiece was just as
</p>
<p>familiar with the details as anybody else; presumably so, for

<p>no honorable gentleman will attempt to give publicity to any

</p>
<p>important circumstance involving the good character of his
</p>
<p>fellowmen, unless he is first satisfied of the truthfulness of
</p>
<p>his position by a candid investigation. [Applause.] But don't
</p>
<p>you see that to have stated that William Buder, a non-"Mormon," was the incendiary would have spoiled the object, for
</p>
<p>the crime must be placed upon the Lroad shoulders of the
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints? [Applause ] It must be shown that they
</p>
<p>are lawless, and that they threatened and endangered the lives
</p>
<p>of these lambs-in wolves' clothing. [Laughter and applause. ]*
</p>
<p>Some of the churches are quite remarkable for heroes.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, you are not aware of the
</p>
<p>heroism that has been occasionally exhibited right in your
</p>
<p>midst. ["No."] Perhaps I might state some instances of
</p>
<p>such heroism. There was another reverend gentleman, by
</p>
<p>the name of McMillan, whose diocese was for a time in Sanpete County, Utah. Hle was treated with great consideration
</p>
<p>and kindness by the people there. He was given the free use
</p>
<p>of the meeting house of the "Mormons, ' in the town of
</p>
<p>E Jphraim, and he was very grateful. You will see the character of his gratitude at a glance when I show you how he
</p>
<p>returned the courtesy shown him by the savage 'Mormons."
</p>
<p>He went back to the East. What for? Because there is more
</p>
<p>than one pur:ose in regard to the defamation of the "Mormon" community.
</p>
<p>It is naturally to be supposed that these
</p>
<p>heroes shall make a sensational anti-"Mormon" speech when
</p>
<p>they go East to facilitate the process of passing around the
</p>
<p>hat. Therefore he had to make a hero of himself. He made
</p>
<p>the declaration that in the quiet town of Ephraim, in Sanpete, this remarkably brave man, when he mounted the
</p>
<p>rostrum had to take in one hand a weapon of death-a revolver-and the word of the Lord in the other [laughter and
</p>
<p>applause] to protect himself against the lawless "Mormons"
</p>
<p>who sought his life.
</p>
<p>What an absurdity this story bears on it face when you think
</p>
<p>of it. When he returned he was met or waited upon by

</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>Canute Petersen, one of the leading men of Sanpete County,
</p>
<p>who spoke to him about his misstatements, and pointed out
</p>
<p>to him that such fabrications were most infamous. He was
</p>
<p>very sorry. He was humble. He was very meek. He said
</p>
<p>he felt as if he had done wrong, but he would make it right
</p>
<p>just as soon as it was possible. He subsequently paid another
</p>
<p>visit to the East. How did he make it right? He simply
</p>
<p>repeated his former statements and added a few more falsehoods to give spice to his story, and his speech was subsequently published in the Denver papers.
</p>
<p>But this was a second-hand way of making notoriety; for
</p>
<p>the Rev. Lyford, who had officiated at Provo, had made himself a hero in the same line. Some of you remember, perhaps, his remarkable hairbreadth escapes; but he always came
</p>
<p>out alive [laughter and applause] and consequently his own
</p>
<p>existence furnishes the best evidence of the falsity of his statenlents. If that gentleman had dropped the latter tart of his
</p>
<p>name and left the first two letters it would have been exactly
</p>
<p>in keeping with his conduct. [Applause.]
</p>
<p>When I was in Ogden in 1881, on July 11th of that year,
</p>
<p>a committee of a Methodist conference that was held there
</p>
<p>expressed their views on the "Mormon" question, and what
</p>
<p>ought to be done with it. Their resolutions were published at
</p>
<p>the time; they were duly given to a gaping world Here is an
</p>
<p>extract from that document:
</p>
<p>"Mormonism holds the balance of power in Idaho and Arizona and menaces New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and
</p>
<p>Montana. We believe polygamy is a foul system of licentiousness, practiced in the name of religion, hence hideous and
</p>
<p>revolting. It should not be reasoned with, but ought to be
</p>
<p>STAMPED OUT."
</p>
<p>Fancy that! The "Mormon" religion must not be reasoned
</p>
<p>with. Do not bring the magical touchstone of reason to bear
</p>
<p>upon this question at all, but apply the truly Christian
</p>
<p>method; let it be "stamped out." [Applause.] 0 what
</p>
<p>a rarity in Christian charity! [Applause.] Only fancy, if
</p>
<p>you can, the Savior of the world, and those whom Ile chose
</p>
<p>to officiate in connection with Him, speaking to -His disciples

</p>
<p>in reference to the religions that existed in that day, and that
</p>
<p>AND ITS CAUSES
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>were not similar to that which He taught, telling them, "these
</p>
<p>religions are wrong, they are not right; do not reason with
</p>
<p>them; they must be 'stamped out.' " And yet these men who
</p>
<p>met together in Ogden and considered the question of another
</p>
<p>religion, take the position that that religion, because it does
</p>
<p>not conform to their ideas, should not be reasoned with, but
</p>
<p>that it should be "stamped out." What an outrage on common sense and common decency!
</p>
<p>What a parody on the
</p>
<p>Christian religion are these men and their views! [Applause.]
</p>
<p>They alo made this political recommendation:
</p>
<p>"Resolved that it is the sense of this body that the laws of
</p>
<p>this Territory should be made by a council appointed by the
</p>
<p>President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate."
</p>
<p>This means that every vestige of popular government
</p>
<p>should be swept away from this Territory and an autocracy
</p>
<p>established in its place. But you must remember that they
</p>
<p>are opposed to any interference in any shape whatever of the
</p>
<p>church with the state except, of course, when they do it
</p>
<p>themselves.
</p>
<p>I hold in my hand the conspirators' campaign document,
</p>
<p>"A Handbook on Mormonism," it is called. I call it a production of diabolism; for it is filled with lies and misrepresentations against the 'Mormon" people and their religion
</p>
<p>from beginning to end. 1 will read you one little extract from the bitter pen of Rev. J M. Coyner. His
</p>
<p>name is suggestive. As a coiner of falsehoods he is a
</p>
<p>decided success. [Applause.] There are many "Mormons" present. Listen how this man describes your religion:
</p>
<p>"Mormonism is made up of twenty parts. Take eight parts
</p>
<p>diabolism, three parts of animalism from the Mohammedan
</p>
<p>system, one part bigotry from old Judaism, four parts cunning
</p>
<p>and treachery from Jesuitism, two parts Thuggism fiom India
</p>
<p>and two parts Arnoldism, and then shake the mixture over
</p>
<p>the fires of animal passion, and throw in the forms and ceremonies of the Christian religion, and you will have this system
</p>
<p>in its true component elements."
</p>
<p>A professed Christian wrote this, for it is not the policy of

<p>men such as he to allow the "Mormons" to describe their own

</p>
<p>religion. Of course, the Methodists, the Presbyterians and all
</p>
<p>other denominations would expect that it would be the proper
</p>
<p>thing to go outside of themselves, and especially to their enemies, for a correct description or explanation of their religious
</p>
<p>tenets and views. Judging from the way they treat the "Mormons," one would suppose that that would be their idea; to
</p>
<p>be consistent it would.
</p>
<p>But is this campaign document altogether religious? Not
</p>
<p>by any means. Do not make a mistake by supposing so; for
</p>
<p>wherever you find the religious wing of the Utah conspiracy,
</p>
<p>you will find the political wing within short range. Who are
</p>
<p>the writers of the articles in this book-"The Handbook on
</p>
<p>Mormonism"-the product of diabolism? I will give you a
</p>
<p>few of them you are familiar with. The Rev. R. G. McNiece,
</p>
<p>[laughter] Eli H. Murray, [great laughter and applause]
</p>
<p>the Rev. J. M. Coyner, Jacob S. Boreman, [laughter and
</p>
<p>applause] the Rev. T. B. Hilton, J. R. McBride, [laughter]
</p>
<p>0. J. Hollister [much laughter and applause] and others.
</p>
<p>(The lecturer created great merriment by using the plaintive tone commonly used by a priest when he named the clergymen, and vociferating after the manner of a stump speaker
</p>
<p>when he uttered the name of a political schemer.)
</p>
<p>There is another source more prolific of defamation in
</p>
<p>this community. I refer to the Salt Lake Tribune, the organ
</p>
<p>of the conspirators. I wish that source to furnish some of the
</p>
<p>evidence to sustain the position that I take to-night. There
</p>
<p>was published on the 15th day of March, 1884, what was
</p>
<p>termed "A Red Hot Address." It purported to have been
</p>
<p>delivered by a "Mormon" Bishop named West, in the little
</p>
<p>town of Juab in the southern portion of this Territory. It
</p>
<p>was very prudent to select a little side station; for tl:e discovery of a forgery would not, in the opinion of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>be so easily made if perpetrated upon a place of that kind.
</p>
<p>What was the character of that "Red lot Address," said to
</p>
<p>have been delivered by a "Mormon" Bishop?
</p>
<p>It recommended the assassination of those who opposed the "Mormon"

<p>community. One of the objects of the wrath of Bishop West
</p>
<p>AND ITS CAUSES'.
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>was His Excellency Governor Eli H. Murray. And Bishop
</p>
<p>West told his audience that it was their imperative duty to
</p>
<p>seize upon His Excellency and tread him down until his
</p>
<p>bowels gushed out on the streets, and that those, who should
</p>
<p>succeed him, if they did not behave themselves better toward
</p>
<p>the "Mormon" community than he, should be treated in a similar way. This "Red Hot Address' was true, with a few
</p>
<p>trifling exceptions. I wish you to note the exceptions; for the
</p>
<p>organ of the conspirators does not stand upon trifles; not by
</p>
<p>any means. ["No.'] In the first place there is no Bishop
</p>
<p>West in the "Mormon' Church, and has not been for many
</p>
<p>years. There was no meeting held in Juab on the day on
</p>
<p>which that address was said to lhave been delivered. No
</p>
<p>address of that kind was ever delivered. With these trifling
</p>
<p>exceptions the address was entirely correct.* [Laughter and
</p>
<p>applause. 1
</p>
<p>I wish you to note this fact, however, that if there ever
</p>
<p>were any individuals on the face of this earth susceptible of
</p>
<p>being deceived, they are the editors of the Sa(lt Lake Tribone. They are so innocent, so guileless, so harmless themselves, that they do not think that anybody would do anything, wrong. They ar, remarkable for innocence. Why, a
</p>
<p>child might deceive them-that is providing-providing they
</p>
<p>are supplied with something that will scandalize the characters of the "Mornmon" community. Then they are easily
</p>
<p>deceived. Very easily deceived, indeed. So this "Red Hot
</p>
<p>Address" was a canard. They were very much deceived. They
</p>
<p>even went so far as to say that they were really imposed upon
</p>
<p>by siume person who furnished that address for publication,
</p>
<p>and they made an apology. What an apology it was! An
</p>
<p>apology for an apology. Let me see what kind of an apology
</p>
<p>they made for this "Red Hot Address," fabricated out of whole
</p>
<p>cloth. Here is a quotation from the paper of which I am
</p>
<p>speaking:
</p>
<p>"The case of the 'Red Hot Address' has been cited, which
</p>
<p>was corrected as soon as the managers of this journal found
</p>
<p>they had been imposed upon."

</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>Here is a qualification to that apology quoted from the same
</p>
<p>sheet:
</p>
<p>"There was not a thing in that bogus sermon which has not
</p>
<p>been taught in the Tabernacle harangues."
</p>
<p>What do you think of an apology of that kind? I call that
</p>
<p>a re-assertion of the fabrication, and the apology is worse than
</p>
<p>the first falsehood. [Applause ]
</p>
<p>I will give you another sample apology for something else;
</p>
<p>goodness knows what, that appeared in that innocent sheet.
</p>
<p>Here it is:
</p>
<p>"By a mistake a jot appeared in the Tribune yesterday,
</p>
<p>which does not reflect the -entiments of any owner or director
</p>
<p>ot this journal. It was, too. as objiectionable in manner as matter. It was altogether wrong; its publication is a matter of
</p>
<p>pain and mortification to us, and we grieve sincerely that it ever
</p>
<p>found its way into the Tribeune."
</p>
<p>Can you tell me to what that refers? What predicament
</p>
<p>does that leave me and you in, lidies and gentlemen? It
</p>
<p>leaves you and me in this dilemma, that we must apply that
</p>
<p>apology to the entire sheet, and you must do that in order to
</p>
<p>cover the ground. [Laughter and applause.]
</p>
<p>We hear it frequently asserted by these journalists, these
</p>
<p>conspirators I must not, I suppose, use that word too often,
</p>
<p>because I might perhaps tread on some of their corns, and I
</p>
<p>surely would not like to do that; but we are frequently told
</p>
<p>that these men are "American gentlemen." I think they must

</p>
<p>now he would be ashamed of himself. Gentlemen, of' course,
</p>
<p>are considerate of the feelings of others. They are very delicate about giving offense, and especially avoid speaking in a
</p>
<p>derogatory way of any sentiment or feeling that is sacred in
</p>
<p>the breasts of their fellow creatures. "American gentlemen"
</p>
<p>would never do that.

<p>I call your attention to a portion of the faith of the "Mormon religion. The "Mormons" believe in the religion that
</p>
<p>AND ITS CA USE.,.
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>they have espoused, and like other people they have a right
</p>
<p>to their religious views. They believe that by the performance
</p>
<p>of vicarious work, the performance by proxy of ordinances by
</p>
<p>the living for the dead-provided it is accepted by the dead in
</p>
<p>the spirit world, a saving influence is brought to bear upon
</p>
<p>those who have passed away from this earth without obedience
</p>
<p>to the gospel. This is a sacred principle with them. It is so
</p>
<p>sacred to them, and it is a subject of such absorbing interest
</p>
<p>to them, that I know of men in the community that have traversed sea and land for thousands of miles for the purpose of
</p>
<p>gleaning information in regard to their dead relatives, that
</p>
<p>they might officiate in their stead, and their work here be of
</p>
<p>some benefit to their progenitors, and, as I have said, their
</p>
<p>views are sacred to them. Of course no gentleman would hold
</p>
<p>up their religious views as a subject for vulgar merriment,
</p>
<p>however much he might differ from them. He would consider them sacred to him because sacred to his fellow- creatures.
</p>
<p>lie would not hold them up to ridicule and make those who
</p>
<p>entertain them the laughing-stock of the populace. Surely an
</p>
<p>'American gentleman" would not be guilty of so grave and
</p>
<p>vulgar a breach of common decency as this. But let us see.
</p>
<p>I will read an extract from the paper published, managed and
</p>
<p>conducted by the self-described "American gentlemen":
</p>
<p>OFFICIATING FOR THE STIFFS.
</p>
<p>"A short time ago a Mormon Saintess went through the
</p>
<p>Logan Temple and was baptized or sealed to and had adopted
</p>
<p>into her family thirty dead relatives. It took three days to
</p>
<p>perform the various ceremonies and ordinations, and no doubt
</p>
<p>the defunct will now rise from their tombs, or from their
</p>
<p>HEATED DWELLING places. Her husband contemplates going
</p>
<p>through a similar ceremony and as he has taken the trouble to
</p>
<p>look up his genealogy, he has calculated that it will take
</p>
<p>him exactly four months to perform the sacred rites for the
</p>
<p>various STIFFS that were once members of his family. The
</p>
<p>fools are not all dead yet."
</p>
<p>And this, ladies and gentleman, emanated from these considerate "American gentlemen." [Applause.] Judge ye of

<p>THE TENNESSEE MASS'ACRE
</p>
<p>in the vile calumnies that have been heaped upon private individuals. I would not insult this audience by recounting the
</p>
<p>foul aspersions, the assassin stabs upon private character that
</p>
<p>have been again and again and again perpetrated in the most
</p>
<p>shameless manner in that unprincipled sheet published and conducted by the self-described "American gentlemen.' [Applause. ]
</p>
<p>In speaking of the clique that constantly conspires against
</p>
<p>the commonwealth of Utah, I would not have you suppose
</p>
<p>that I refer to the bulk of non-Mormons of this Territory,
</p>
<p>among whom are to be found many honorable people who have
</p>
<p>no lot nor part in the conspiracy and who do not give it their
</p>
<p>sympathy. The plot is confined to a comparatively few designing characters, who spare no efforts to whip others into line.
</p>
<p>The operations of these enemies of liberty in Utah,are, in my
</p>
<p>opinion, heartily despised by many people who have no connection with the "Mormon" Church, nor sympathy with its doctrines. Even numbers of clergymen take this position.
</p>
<p>THE OBJECT OF TIE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>What has been the object of these vile detractions of an
</p>
<p>innocent community? Two fold in its character. The religious wing of the conspiracy desires to have the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>religion crushed out, because in their operations here they
</p>
<p>have no religious success. Their efforts are barren and unfruitful. They stay here and go back eastward when they wish to
</p>
<p>pass around the hat. They return after getting the financial
</p>
<p>benefits of their vile calumnies and giving descriptions of their
</p>
<p>personal heroism and hairbreadth escapes among the lawless
</p>
<p>"Mormons." They are hirelings. They preach for hire and
</p>
<p>divine for money. The Elders of the 'Mormon" Church are
</p>
<p>a standing reproach to such men. Like the immediate followers of Him whom they profess to serve, they go out into
</p>
<p>the world without purse or scrip, as they did, and they have
</p>
<p>success in their labors. When they go they take their lives in
</p>
<p>their hands as those men did who were brutally murdered on
</p>
<p>Cane Creek, Lewis County, Tennessee; and when they return

</p>
<p>ious, honest and industrious community is built up in the
</p>
<p>Territory of Utah and adjacent places in this part of the great
</p>
<p>West. The success of these Elders is a standing reproach to
</p>
<p>the hirelings who have no success in their labors, and therefore they want that reproach wiped out, or, according to the
</p>
<p>priests who assembled in Ogden, they desire that "Mormonism" should not be reasoned with but stampeed out. This is
</p>
<p>the object of the religious wing of this conspiracy. When
</p>
<p>the Elders go abroad they have a great deal to meet. For
</p>
<p>instance I will explain what they have had to encounter in
</p>
<p>western and middle Tennessee, where the Elders who were
</p>
<p>slain on Cane Creek were laboring. What was the situation
</p>
<p>before that horrible tragedy was consummated? Everywhere
</p>
<p>they went, they had presented to them
</p>
<p>the "Red Hot
</p>
<p>Address," pullished in this city by the organ of the conspirators. It was specially handed about and circulated by a Baptist preacher natned VYandever, of Hohenwald, Lewis County.
</p>
<p>I have the facts lere [holding up a letter in his hand]* giving
</p>
<p>names and details from one of the survivors of the massacre
</p>
<p>on Cane Creek Eller W. 11. Jones. It has been said that
</p>
<p>there has been no evidence of the "Red Hot Address" ever
</p>
<p>having gone to Tennessee. Not only was that "Red Hot
</p>
<p>Address" there, but Elder Gibbs who was slain, and Elder
</p>
<p>Jones who survives, presented to this Baptist-preacher wh.m
</p>
<p>I have named a refutation of the slanderous fabrication, in
</p>
<p>order that he might rediess the evil that he had accomplished
</p>
<p>by its dissemination among the people, and which had
</p>
<p>inflamed the minds of the populace to such an extent that
</p>
<p>they were prepared l;rgely by that statement or alleged
</p>
<p>address purporting to have been delivered by a "Mormon"
</p>
<p>bishop, to shed the blood of the Elders, and they did it; and
</p>
<p>*-EXTRACT FROM ELDER JONES' LETTER. This villainous, slanderous fabrication was circulated over the country.
</p>
<p>Parson Vandever worked up prejudice against us in that section
</p>
<p>by giving it [the 'Red Hot Address'] wide publicity, and by his
</p>
<p>pretended credence to the falsehood, causing great excitement.

<p>THE TENIVAESSEE MASSA CRE
</p>
<p>the blood of innocence is upon the skirts of those who perpetrated that infamy. The authorship of an indirect causeof
</p>
<p>the murder is now traced home to them; they cannot relieve
</p>
<p>themselves of it.
</p>
<p>What is the other part of the conspiracy? The "Mormons"
</p>
<p>are in the majority here, and as the majority rules everywhere
</p>
<p>in this republic, as a natural consequence they hold the balance of political power in the Territory. And the infamous
</p>
<p>lies, some of which I have recounted, that have been spread
</p>
<p>far and wide to show that thQ "M'ormons" are a lawless people, that they are a vile people, that they are not fit to live,
</p>
<p>were intended to form a prejudice in the minds of' the people
</p>
<p>throughout the country generally, in order that the conspirators might operate under that feeling with impunity. They
</p>
<p>imagined that but few if any people in the nation, in the light
</p>
<p>or face of existing prejudice thus created, would think they
</p>
<p>were doing wrong. This part of the conspiracy is to sweep
</p>
<p>away from Utah every vestige of popular rule and concentrate
</p>
<p>the political power in the hands of an unscrupulous few, or in
</p>
<p>the hands of what I call the office-seekers' combination of
</p>
<p>Utah-those who are hungry for office and its spoils-that
</p>
<p>they might grind the "Mormon" community into the dust.
</p>
<p>I will give you the proof, and the other side shall supply the
</p>
<p>evidence:
</p>
<p>In November, 1880, an election was held in this Territory
</p>
<p>for a delegate to Congress from Utah. The candidate of the
</p>
<p>People's Party was the Hon. George Q. Cannon, the candidate of the conspirators Mr. Allen G. Campbell. The Hon.
</p>
<p>George Q. Cannon received o' the popular vote on that occasion considerable over 1I,000 votes, and Allen G. Campbell
</p>
<p>about 1,300. Did this express the popular will? In what
</p>
<p>more forcible way can the popular will be exhibited than by
</p>
<p>the franchise? It was the duty of His Excellency, Governor
</p>
<p>Eli H. Murray, to furnish the candidate who received the
</p>
<p>largest number of votes a certificate to that effect, to present
</p>
<p>as a credential in the House of Representatives, and he gave

</p>

</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>that not prove, as tar as it goes, the character of the conspiracy? It is to usurp the political authority that belongs to
</p>
<p>the people in a republican form of government. He who gave
</p>
<p>that certificate, certified to a falsehood, and made an attempt
</p>
<p>to dethrone the power of the people, to thwart the public will,
</p>
<p>the popular will, and establish his will, an autocracy, and to
</p>
<p>wrest from the people the reins of government.
</p>
<p>I will still further show the political character of the conspiracy, and also why so many infamous lies have been told
</p>
<p>about the "Mormons." that under cover of these falsehoods
</p>
<p>and the prejudice resulting, the objects of this conspiracy
</p>
<p>might be attained.
</p>
<p>On the 3rd day of August, 1882, there was inserted in the
</p>
<p>sundry civil appropriation bill, in Congress, an amendment
</p>
<p>made by Senator Hoar.
</p>
<p>It was offered in view of the tact
</p>
<p>that through the negligence of the Utah Commission the
</p>
<p>election that ought to have occurred in that month lapsed.
</p>
<p>The amendment thus inserted
</p>
<p>was passed there, giving
</p>
<p>authority to His Excellency, Eli H. Murray, to fill all vacancies
</p>
<p>that might occur in offices in this Territory through the lapse
</p>
<p>of that election that should have been held. Fortunately,
</p>
<p>however, there is a Territorial statute which provides that in
</p>
<p>case of any deficiency in regard to filling the offices by the lapse
</p>
<p>of an election, or through any other cause, such as an intended
</p>
<p>successor to an ffioce not qualifying within statutory time, the
</p>
<p>incumbent should hold over until such time as a legal election
</p>
<p>should take place; and therefore there were no vacancies. So
</p>
<p>it was held pretty generally even by those that were very
</p>
<p>prominent. subsequiently, on the other side. I might be
</p>
<p>allowed to state liere that it is publicly known that Mr. Marshall, a prominent lawyer of this city, stated that there were
</p>
<p>no vacancies, and lie so expressed himself to quite a number
</p>
<p>of persons belonging to the People's Pirty. However, passing
</p>
<p>that over I now direct your attention to the fact that there
</p>
<p>were a large number of offices that were not vacant in any
</p>
<p>case, the election to which could not legally have occurred for
</p>
<p>a year subsequent to that August election. But the party

</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>Utah do not stand upon trifles; His Excellency, Eli H. Murray, in the face of these facts, endeavored to fill nearly every
</p>
<p>office in Utah Territory by his appointment. and in that way
</p>
<p>overthrow every vestige of' polpular rule in Utah Territory.
</p>
<p>This was an evidence of the impatience of the office hunters'
</p>
<p>party, because they anticipated by this act the legislation which
</p>
<p>they desired on that sublject. Much anxiety has been manifested by certain persons whom I have named in regard to the
</p>
<p>political affairs of this Territory. Among the officers-among
</p>
<p>these would-be officers-a-ppointees of the governor, were
</p>
<p>found some of the gentlemen who figured conspicuously in the
</p>
<p>first meeting in the Methodist Church, the details of which I
</p>
<p>have already furnished this audience. Judge Jacob S. Boreman was gubernatorially appointed to an office in this county;
</p>
<p>also Mr. J. F. Bradley. It is a wonder that Judge J. R.
</p>
<p>McBride was left out in the cold; but there was nothing large
</p>
<p>enough, I presume, to satisfy that gentleman. [Laughter.]
</p>
<p>Have I not proven to a demonstration the object of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and the reason why such infamous fabricated
</p>
<p>statements are sent abroad to prejudice the minds of the
</p>
<p>people against the ''Mormon"' community? I think that I
</p>
<p>have, and I have taken the evidence from the -ther side of
</p>
<p>the fence. They have furnished the proof themselves, and I
</p>
<p>have only made use of it.

</p>
<p>EFFECrS OF TIHE CONSPIRACY UP1ON CONGRESS.
</p>
<p>What are the effects of this conspiracy and this prejudice
</p>
<p>upon Congress? The effects are these: Laws that we consider to be unconstitutional are introduce!l into Congress and
</p>
<p>some of them are passed and become law. For instance there
</p>
<p>is the Edmunds law with;which you are all more or less familiar. One of its chief objects was to disfranchise those who
</p>
<p>were practical polygamlists in the 'Mormon" community, and
</p>
<p>that was effectually done in the operation of that law. But
</p>
<p>some men have India rubber consciences, and they injected
</p>
<p>this India rubber material into the law and made it stretch.
</p>
<p>The Utah Commission-I talk respectfully of that body of

</p>
<p>gentlemen-made that law stretch to its utmost capacity.
</p>
<p>AND ITS CAUSES.
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>They almost went outside of polygamy altogether. If they
</p>
<p>had just gone half an inch further they would have excluded
</p>
<p>from the polls persons who were first cousins to polygamists.
</p>
<p>[Applause and laughter.] There is one very peculiar feature
</p>
<p>associated with the Edmunds law. There has been introduced
</p>
<p>in connection with its operations, without the color or authority
</p>
<p>of law, a test oath. That oath made its first appearance, I
</p>
<p>think, in 1879-if my memory serves me correctly-in what
</p>
<p>was known as the Willits' bill, a measure that was introduced
</p>
<p>into Congress, but did not pass. It was formulated-so I
</p>
<p>have been given to understand-by the Utah conspirators here
</p>
<p>and furnished to Mr. Willits to be incorporated in his Utah
</p>
<p>bill. It was subsequently used by His Excellency, Eli H.
</p>
<p>Murray, and had to be subscribed to by every person elected to
</p>
<p>any office in this Territory before he could receive a commission.
</p>
<p>And now, under the Edmunds law, every person who walks
</p>
<p>up to the registrar's office to register has to take this iron-clad
</p>
<p>oath, a copy of which I now hold in my hand. If I had been
</p>
<p>a conspirator I do not think that I should have favored the
</p>
<p>introduction of this particular oath. My reason for this is
</p>
<p>that, according to a vulgarism, it "gives the whole thing
</p>
<p>away." I will not read the entire oath, but will read a portion of it: "That I have not lived or cohabited with more
</p>
<p>than one woman in the marriage relation." [The lecturer's
</p>
<p>manner of uttering the words in italics in a subdued tone created great laughter and applause.] That oath makes a wide
</p>
<p>opening through which the corruptionist, steeped up to his
</p>
<p>neck in filth and crime can crawl [loud applause] and builds
</p>
<p>around the man who conscientiously enters more or less into
</p>
<p>the marriage relation a wall deep, thick and high, so that he cannot
</p>
<p>get through or climb over. Does not that give the thing away?
</p>
<p>I am not displeased that they formulated that oath. It shows
</p>
<p>the position exactly. It exhibits the superiority of the "Mormon" community over the corruptionists. [Applause.]
</p>
<p>There is a custom whenever a man comes into special prominence in political matters for his admirers to wear a particular
</p>
<p>kind of hat. For instance, there is the Cleveland hat, and
</p>
<p>there is the Blaine hat. I have a recommendation to offer to

<p>the conspirators, and why not adopt it? Let us have an
</p>
<p>"anti-marriage relation hat." [Applause,] Let it be of spotless white, emblematical of the purity of the characters of
</p>
<p>those entitled to wear it [laughter] and let there be written
</p>
<p>in gold letters-large, so they can be easily read by the passing
</p>
<p>observer-the words: "I HAVE NOT LIVED NOR COHABITED WITH MORE THAN ONE WOMAN," and
</p>
<p>in small letters [applause and laughter] so that you can hardly
</p>
<p>see them, "In the marriage relation." [Renewed applause and
</p>
<p>laughter.] The saving clause should be very obscure, it tells
</p>
<p>such a horrible tale.
</p>
<p>In the anti- "Mormon" crusade first meeting, details of which
</p>
<p>I have given, Judge McBride said that he desired that that
</p>
<p>legal provision which prevented a woman from testifying against
</p>
<p>her husband should be expunged from the statute books, and
</p>
<p>you can see the ear-marks of the Utah conspirators in all the
</p>
<p>legislation that has been introduced into Congress. I am not
</p>
<p>here to blame the national legislators for what they have done,
</p>
<p>for I believe it has been largely the result of the misrepresentations that have been made by the conspirators whose head
</p>
<p>quarters are in this city. They have acted in the belief that
</p>
<p>the "Mormon" community were as vile as they have been
</p>
<p>painted by these, I was going to say -- you can imagine I.do not wish to use anything but respectful language, because I
</p>
<p>am speaking of "American gentlemen." [Applause.] And
</p>
<p>what is the character of the crusade legislation? One of the
</p>
<p>first provisions of the Hoar amendment act passed by the
</p>
<p>Senate at its last session, provides that the wife shall testify
</p>
<p>against the husband, and as the husband and the wife are one,
</p>
<p>the monstrous doctrine is incorporated that a man shall be
</p>
<p>compelled to testify, in that sense, against himself: What an
</p>
<p>outrage to attempt to demolish a leading safeguard which
</p>
<p>maintains the sacredness of the family circle! Shame on the
</p>
<p>instigators of such legislation! I have a right to express my
</p>
<p>sentiments regarding so flagrant an outrage'sought to be perpetrated upon an innocent people.
</p>
<p>This law also proposes, in certain cases, that a witness shall
</p>
<p>be treated as a criminal by abolishing the ordinary process of

</p>
<p>And the "Mormon" community, according to this remarkable measure, shall have no power to transact their own secular
</p>
<p>business, but it proposes to perform it for them by fourteen
</p>
<p>trustees appointed by the President of the United States. It
</p>
<p>is a wonder that they did not incorporate some provision in the
</p>
<p>law that Bishop Preston and his Counselors of the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church should be deposed from their positions-it amounts to
</p>
<p>nearly the same thing-and that a Bishop and Counselors be
</p>
<p>appointed by the President of the United States [laughter].
</p>
<p>Further, the franchise is, according to this law, to be swept
</p>
<p>away from the ladies. What an ungallant lot these conspirators are! Operating against the ladies whom they claim
</p>
<p>are in bondage in Utah, and yet'they want to take an unwarrantable step to enslave them politically.
</p>
<p>It further provides that the property of the "Mormons" shall
</p>
<p>be confiscated summarily; and that under no pretence whatever shall the people amalgamate for the purpose of bringing
</p>
<p>people to this Territory from abroad. Therefore, if this were
</p>
<p>law-let us hope for the sake of republican institutions that
</p>
<p>it never will be-you would not have the privilege of bringing
</p>
<p>to this land your father, or your grandmother, or your cousins,
</p>
<p>or your aunt, or any of your relatives, because they are "Mormons.."
</p>
<p>What a parody on legislation!-the result of the work of a
</p>

<p>I will now show the position that has been taken by representatives of the conspiracy since the massacre took place,

<p>THE PENVNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>profession. He is called Judge Goodwin. I do not know
</p>
<p>how far that goes. I presume that if I was to say to this
</p>
<p>audience, for the purpose of receiving an answer, "How do
</p>
<p>you do, Colonel?" there would by a chorus of voices, there are
</p>
<p>so many colonels in this country. And so it is with judges.
</p>
<p>But I believe that the gentleman I now speak of possesses
</p>
<p>legal knowledge. What an unfortunate thing that he does
</p>
<p>not inject it into his journalism!
</p>
<p>Here is a quotation embodying another quotation, which
</p>
<p>the Tribune in its issue of Sep. 16th, 1884, contains:
</p>
<p>"On the other'hand, the reason why the violence was committed has been boldly given. The clergyman of Nashville,
</p>
<p>extracts of whose sermon we gave last week, openly says:"
</p>
<p>"'The law-abiding citizens charge upon these Mormon missionaries that, under the guise o' religion, they were attempting to seduce their wives and daughters from the paths of
</p>
<p>virtue, and they have not disproved it.'"
</p>
<p>"We have other evidence of the same kind."
</p>
<p>Were Judge Goodwin on the bench instead of the tripod,
</p>
<p>and he should take a similar position in regard to charges
</p>
<p>made against alleged law-breakers brought before him, what
</p>
<p>would be the result? Suppose a man was charged with murder
</p>
<p>in his court, and the jury were asked to bring in a verdict,
</p>
<p>his instructions after the trial would be something like this:
</p>
<p>"You must bring in a verdict of guilty, for this man is
</p>
<p>charged with murder, and has not disproved it." What a remarkable position to be taken by an intelligent man! According to his position all you have to do in order to prove a
</p>
<p>person guilty is to make a charge against him, and convict
</p>
<p>him providing he fails to disprove it. That is reversing the
</p>
<p>usual methods of justice with a vengeance. These Elders
</p>
<p>were charged by the local priests whose prejudices, probably, were incited by the "Red Hot Address" and other
</p>
<p>documents of that description-with attempting to seduce the
</p>
<p>wives and daughters of citizens of Tennessee, and they have
</p>
<p>not disproved it. What a travesty on common sense! How

<p>absurd!. How ridiculous! But then they have other evidenceproof-of tile same kind. They have evidence to the effect
</p>
<p>A D ITS CA USES.
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>that charges have been made against these Elders, and these
</p>
<p>Elders have not disproved it. Very remarkable that they
</p>
<p>have not disproved it seeing that they are dead!. What a
</p>
<p>wonderful thing to take place in our day, that these men,
</p>
<p>murdered in cod blood, because charg(s have been made
</p>
<p>against them to palliate the crime perpetrated by the murderers, and because they do not rise out of their graves, to
</p>
<p>which they were sent by the hands of assassins before their
</p>
<p>time, to disprove the charges, they must be guilty! How
</p>
<p>supremely ridiculous!
</p>
<p>After the murder was perpetrated all the respect that could
</p>
<p>be shown by a grief stricken community was exhibited to
</p>
<p>those who were ruthlessly slain. Their remains were buried
</p>
<p>by those who survived that awful tragedy near the spot where
</p>
<p>their blood was shed. Elder B. H. Roberts, and others, at
</p>
<p>the risk of their lives, proceeded to the place where they were
</p>
<p>entombed and exhumed the bodies and prepared them to be
</p>
<p>dispatched to their sorrowing relatives, as the last grain of
</p>
<p>comfort that could be given to the bereaved. I said these
</p>
<p>men performed this brotherly act at the risk of their lives, as
</p>
<p>was subsequently proved. On their return trip from Cane
</p>
<p>Creek they lost their way. Happily for them that they did;
</p>
<p>for there was a party of mobbers ambushed ready to shed their
</p>
<p>blood also, even when they were on this mission of mercy and
</p>
<p>brotherly kindness. However; the bodies were brought here.
</p>
<p>The remains of Elder Berry were taken to the South, to Kanarra and consigned to his family, and the remains of Elder
</p>
<p>Gibbs to Paradise, his home when he was alive. And throughout this Territory, and in every place where the news had
</p>
<p>reached the 'Mormons," arrangements were made to hold
</p>
<p>services in honor of the dead, to show the respect of the
</p>
<p>people for those who had been slain Among these meetings
</p>
<p>was a large assemblage in the Tabernacle of this city, which
</p>
<p>was crowded on the occasion; an immense host convened there,
</p>
<p>and certain Elders poured out their thoughts in words of
</p>
<p>respect for the dead and grief for the awful act that had caused

</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>But more eloquently still was the prevailing sentiment expressed by the moistened eyes which could be seen all over
</p>
<p>that vast congregation, so far as the faces came distinctly
</p>
<p>within the range of vision of the observer.
</p>
<p>What was the position taken by the organ of the conspirators, the Salt Lake Tribune, regarding these solemn ceremonies?
</p>
<p>That sheet contained, in its following issue, an alleged description, of the proceedings, and it was a travesty-a farce.
</p>
<p>What think you of men who can be so lost to the better feelings of humanity that they can take the grief, the sorrow of
</p>
<p>their fellow creatures and laughingly gloat over and hold it up
</p>
<p>as something to be vulgarly joked about? I say that the degradation of the human heart cannot reach a lower depth
</p>
<p>than that [applause], and I say that men who can be guilty of
</p>
<p>such an outrage are lost to all of the better feelings of humanity [applause]. Perhaps you think I speak strongly on this
</p>
<p>subject. I want you to understand that I speak no more
</p>
<p>strongly than I feel [applause].
</p>
<p>Perhaps there may be some in the audience that think an
</p>
<p>apology is due from me for my severity. I feel that my
</p>
<p>apology must be of a similar character to that which was given
</p>
<p>by a member of the British House of Parliament, when he was
</p>
<p>guilty of making some personal remarks regarding a member
</p>
<p>of that august body. He was called upon for an apology; he
</p>
<p>remarked: "1 said the gentleman on the other side was a
</p>
<p>scoundrel, and I am sorry for it." He was sorry he was a
</p>
<p>scoundrel [laughter and applause]. I have stated that men
</p>
<p>who are guilty of such outrages as those which I have described are lost to all that makes man noble, and I am sorry
</p>
<p>for it-I am sorry they are so lost [applause].
</p>
<p>It appears that the surviving Elders in Tennessee, B. H.
</p>
<p>Roberts and others, petitioned Governor Bate of that State
</p>
<p>to take official steps to have the murderers arrested and
</p>
<p>punished for the fearful crime. In response, this magnanimous governor offered the munificent sum of $1,000 to be
</p>
<p>sprsad over a whole crowd of mobbers and murderers. But
</p>
<p>the sum seemed exceedingly large to His Excellency Governor

<p>Eli H. Murray. Doubtless he thought it vastly too much, He

</p>
<p>sent to Governor Bate a dispatch of congratulation. He
</p>
<p>stated in that dispatch that he was glad to see that Governor
</p>
<p>Bate was taking some steps to have those who killed the
</p>
<p>Elders brought to justice, because it was no just reason that
</p>
<p>they should be murdered because they were agents of "organized crime." What do you think the governor sent that
</p>
<p>dispatch for? He was overwhelmed with hypocritical grief.
</p>
<p>He, under cover of this pretended sorrow, like the senseless
</p>
<p>ostrich that thinks when its head is in the sand it cannot be
</p>
<p>seen, only made other portions of his physical structure appear all the more prominent [laughter and applause]. He
</p>
<p>sent that dispatch in order to tell the people of Tennessee and
</p>
<p>the country generally that the Elders who were killed were
</p>
<p>but the agents of "organized crime;" but-really-of course
</p>
<p>-it was not exactly the right thing to kill them. But still
</p>
<p>they were merely agents of "organized crime" [applause]. *
</p>
<p>Perhaps you and I may think that the governor stepped
</p>
<p>out of his way in order to interfere with the affairs of a commonwealth, with which he has no more to do officially or personally than the humblest citizen of this Territory. But,
</p>
<p>then, how could he get it before the country, that the Elders

<p>Aug. 22d.
</p>
<p>Gov. W. B. Bate, Nashville, Tenn.:
</p>
<p>Dispatches state that you are exerting yourself to vindicate
</p>
<p>the laws in the matter of the murder of Mormon missionaries in
</p>
<p>Tennessee. I thank you for this action. The charges of preaching polygamy does not excuse murder. I trust that you may
</p>
<p>bring the guilty to punishment, thereby preventing such lawlessness in Tennessee or elsewhtre. Lawlessness in Tennessee and
</p>
<p>Utah are alike reprehensible. but the murdered Mormon agents
</p>
<p>in Tennessee were sent from here as they have been for years by
</p>
<p>the representatives of organized crime, and I submit that as
</p>
<p>long as Tennessee's representatives in Congress are, to say the
</p>
<p>least, indifferent to the punishment of offenders against the
</p>
<p>national law in Utah, such cowardly outrages by their constituents as the killing of emigration agents sent there from here
</p>
<p>will continue.

</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>should make that interference. It could not be otherwise
</p>
<p>done; so excellent an opportunity could not be let slip in order
</p>
<p>to create, to create, to manufacture the same feeling that
</p>
<p>caused the murder of five human beings and the wounding of
</p>
<p>an innocent woman. That was all that the dispatch was intended to do, in my opinion.
</p>
<p>But do you think that the governor sent that dispatch of
</p>
<p>his own accord and volition altogether? Do you think, now,
</p>
<p>honestly, ladies and gentlemen, that he formulated that dispatch and sent it outside of the conspiracy combination? If
</p>
<p>you do, then you do not exactly believe the same as I do
</p>
<p>[laughter]. I am too familiar with the operations of that small
</p>
<p>circle of schemers to believe any such thing. In the filst
</p>
<p>place my opinion is-when I express an opinion I give it as
</p>
<p>such; when I relate facts I sustain them as facts; I give you
</p>
<p>this as my opinion, you can take it for what it is worth-it
</p>
<p>was first necessary to secure the approval and consent of him
</p>
<p>who has said, on the streets of this city, that he is practically
</p>
<p>the governor of Utah. Do you know who he is? Patrick
</p>
<p>H. Lannan [loud laughter and applause], an American gentleman of Cork [great applause and laughter], or the County
</p>
<p>Down, or some other place in equally close proximity to New
</p>
<p>York or Massachusets [renewed laughter and applause].
</p>
<p>The gentleman whom I have named is given to talking. 1
</p>
<p>might say very much given to talking. It has been said that
</p>
<p>perpetual motion has never been brought to light, but Mr.
</p>
<p>Lannan's tongue comes the nearest to it of anything that has
</p>
<p>been discovered [laughter and applause]. He has stated that
</p>
<p>the governor cannot make any prominent move without he is
</p>
<p>consulted in regard to it. He has told this very broadly, and
</p>
<p>the information is from his side of the house. This is very
</p>
<p>well known, and it rasps a little on the feelings of some of his
</p>
<p>own friends. Now, ladies and gentlemen, as the showman
</p>
<p>said, "you pays your money and you takes your choice"

</p>
<p>THE EDUCATION SUBTERFUGE.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking up too much
</p>
<p>time [loud cries of "No, No," and "Go on"]. There is a
</p>
<p>question that has been agitating this community of late very
</p>
<p>much, especially in some quarters of this city. It is a campaign question with the conspirators. It is the educational
</p>
<p>condition of this Territory. I remember attending a political
</p>
<p>meeting held in front of the, Iribune office on Second South
</p>
<p>Street before it removed to its.present quarters. On a portion of the stand in front of the orators-it was an election
</p>
<p>subiect that was on the tapis-was a vessel that contained a
</p>
<p>liquid to which Mr. Scott Anderson and other temperance
</p>
<p>men very much object. There was a speaker getting off the
</p>
<p>usual anti-Mormon buncombe, and as the contents of the jug
</p>
<p>grew beautifully less his articulation commenced to get proportionately thicker. He reproached the people for their
</p>
<p>alleged lack of educational facilities, and shouted "Where is
</p>
<p>your free schools? [imitating the thick articulation of the half
</p>
<p>intoxicated orator and would-be "Mormon," regenerator.]
</p>
<p>Where is your seminaries of learning?" [Laughter and applause. ]
</p>
<p>There has been on this subject a very large cat lately let out
</p>
<p>of the bag. It was the Methodists that did it this time LLaughter]. You know as well as I know that it has always been
</p>
<p>asserted that the district or common schools of Utah are sectarian, that the books used in them were sectarian or "Mormon" books; that if children of non-"Mormons" were sent
</p>
<p>there they are liable to be indoctrinated in the tenets of the
</p>
<p>"Mormon" faith. This information was conveyed to Senator
</p>
<p>Hoar by the Utah conspirators, as evinced in his speech on the
</p>
<p>Utah bill. I here have his own language, and will quote his
</p>
<p>words to show how he had been stuffed on this subject:
</p>
<p>"We find schools established where the text books are
</p>
<p>selected wholly to instruct the youth of that community in a
</p>
<p>doctrine inconsistent, as we believe, not only with Christianity, but civilization itself."
</p>
<p>He had been primed and loaded by the Utah calumniators

</p>
<p>of the "Mormons." But the Methodists, at a conference
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>THE TENNESSEE MASSACRE
</p>
<p>which lately convened at Ogden, let the whole thing out; for
</p>
<p>they considered a resolution in their meeting as to the advisibility of introducing 'into their denominational schools text
</p>
<p>books the same:'as those in: use lin the "'Mormon' district
</p>
<p>schools." You see they were so anxious-so deeply anxious
</p>
<p>-to have their children indoctrinated in the tenets of "Mormonism," as taught in the school books of the district schools
</p>
<p>of Utah, that they wanted to introduce them into the Methodist schools [Applause], that their pupils might all be made
</p>
<p>full-fledged "Mormons" [Applause]. This exploded the sectarian theory in relation to the district schools altogethernothing left of it at all-and it was like all the subterfuges of
</p>
<p>the conspirators-thin as air.
</p>
<p>Statements have frequently been made to the effect that the
</p>
<p>school-houses are inadequate, that they are mere hovels,
</p>
<p>which is not true, because we have numerous good schoolhouses and efficient teachers in the community, and the facilities for education, considering the age of the Territory, are
</p>
<p>commendable.
</p>
<p>There was recently a meeting held in the 8th Ward to consider the advisability of erecting a school house, the accommodation for the school population in the 8th district being
</p>
<p>insufficient. The object of the meeting was to vote on a tax
</p>
<p>to provide means to accomplish the object in view. I should
</p>
<p>have supposed that about a quarter of an hour or so before
</p>
<p>the time of meeting the 'liberal" gentlemen might have been
</p>
<p>seen rushing towards the place of meeting with their hair
</p>
<p>streaming in the wind and their coat tails in a bee-line behind
</p>
<p>them in order that they might get there in good time to vote
</p>
<p>"Aye" on the tax question, and dig deep into their pockets for
</p>
<p>the shekeis to help build a new school house. I should have
</p>
<p>supposed that they would be in such a hurry to vote on the
</p>
<p>question that they could hardly be held back. But they went
</p>
<p>there and voted solid for "no tax" for school purposes.
</p>
<p>Grandly consistent Their position on this question is like
</p>
<p>that of a man who knocks another man down, puts his foot
</p>
<p>on him, presses him hard down upon the ground, and at the

</p>
<p>AND ITS CA USES.
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>In the 7th Ward, on the 15th instant, a similar meeting
</p>
<p>was held, and the gentlemen belonging to the same party
</p>
<p>["Liberal"] were out in force. Strange to say they took the
</p>
<p>same position as in the 8th district. And there was there in
</p>
<p>all his glory-not a member of the district, I believe; I do
</p>
<p>not know exactly, but I think not-Judge J. R. McBride, the
</p>
<p>excellent and devout Methodist of a former meeting. In his
</p>
<p>usual truthful, logical and consistent style he warned the
</p>
<p>people that only certain persons could vote at any election.
</p>
<p>You can observe the consistency and force of the remarks of
</p>
<p>this learned gentleman, seeing that the meeting was not convened for election purposes at all, but to vote on the question
</p>
<p>of whether there should be a tax imposed on the residents of
</p>
<p>the district so as to increase its educational facilities. Every
</p>
<p>one on the anti-Mormon side of the fence voted "No." It is
</p>
<p>necessary to formulate another argument, now, seeing that the
</p>
<p>sectarian one has fallen through, and it was furnished by Mr.
</p>
<p>0. J. Hollister, ex-internal revenue collector for Utah. He
</p>
<p>deposited his vote on that occasion on the "no tax" side of
</p>
<p>the question. I do not deal with private matters. I deal in
</p>
<p>public affairs, and when a man presents himself before the
</p>
<p>public in a public capacity, then he is a subject for manipulation on the public rostrum. I will give you this new reason,
</p>
<p>furnished in two letters published subsequently to the meeting
</p>
<p>in the Salt Lake Herald, from which I will quote. Listen to
</p>
<p>what this gentleman has to say. Here is a quotation from his
</p>
<p>communication to the Herald.
</p>
<p>"It is no difference what is taught in the so-called public
</p>
<p>schools of Utah or who teaches. The Mormon Church maintains and teaches practices that to the Gentiles are degrading
</p>
<p>and corrupting. There is no social interchange between Mormons and Gentiles, mainly on this account. If this is the
</p>
<p>fact as regards grown people, how much more as regards
</p>
<p>children who cannot be expected to have much wisdom and
</p>
<p>who are so easily contaminated and corrupted."
</p>
<p>Here is the reason, that by the association of Gentile children with "Mormon" children the former become corrupted
</p>
<p>by the intercourse and companionship and are degraded.

</p>
<p>cold-blooded insult not only to every parent in the "Mormon'"
</p>
<p>Church, but to every innocent little, toddling child in that
</p>
<p>community?
</p>
<p>What is the substance of the excuse that is
</p>
<p>offered? It is this: "I am holier than thou." Mr. Hollister
</p>
<p>reminds me of a character in sacred history presented by the
</p>
<p>Savior as an illustration of the different qualities of the petitions that are offered to the throne of grace., Do you remember the prayer of the self-righteous Pharisee?-"Lord I
</p>
<p>thank thee that I am not as other men"'-and let me say here,
</p>
<p>speaking largely for other men, in this instance they are equally
</p>
<p>thankful for the difference. [Applause.] Another argument
</p>
<p>was madeby that gentlemen on the same occasion. Here is
</p>
<p>a quotation from another letter of his:
</p>
<p>"I beg to reaffirm the statement and to aver, besides, that
</p>
<p>the Gentiles have paid the full proportion of the taxes that
</p>
<p>have built and that run the Mormon schools. * *
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>The reason why the Gentiles object to paying special school
</p>
<p>taxes besides the above, is because they cannot avail themselves of any advantage therefrom."
</p>
<p>Here he attmepts to class the "Gentiles" as anti-Mormons,
</p>
<p>by assuming that they all feel as and his fellow-conspirators do. That is the usual trick. But let us consider
</p>
<p>this part of the question: the Gentiles have paid their
</p>
<p>proportion of the taxes for these purposes. 0. J. Hollister was at that meeting, and so was the tax list, so I
</p>
<p>am informed by the gentleman who took it there.
</p>
<p>And
</p>
<p>what was on that tax list? I will tell you; the name of 0. J.
</p>
<p>Hollister conspicuous for its absence. [Applause]. This is
</p>
<p>the position of the oracle of those who fight the school tax.

<p>The "Mormons" -are so very immoral according'to the lies
</p>
<p>that are formulated and spread abroad to further the interest
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy under the popular prejudice that they may
</p>
<p>accomplish their:purposes. In the Salt'Lake Tribune, under
</p>
<p>date of March, 1881, there appeared a peculiar article. The
</p>
<p>editor of the organ of the conspirators had been conversing
</p>
<p>with a gentleman of this city on the "Mormon" question,
</p>
<p>and this gentleman is reported in the article as stating that

<p>visiting drinking saloons, gambling dens, houses of ill-fame;
</p>
<p>and the editor in commenting on the remarks of this so-called
</p>
<p>gentleman, says: "if freedom can be gained without
</p>
<p>excesses, so much the better; but if not, gain the'freedom,
</p>
<p>never mind the excesses." And this from the men who would
</p>
<p>regenerate the "Mormon" community.
</p>
<p>What think you of
</p>
<p>the regenerators of Utah?*
</p>
<p>You are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that I have spoken in
</p>
<p>a similar strain as I have to-night on another occasion, quite
</p>
<p>recently, and I have in consequence been roundly abused by
</p>
<p>the organ of slander, by the organ of the conspirators; but
</p>
<p>never a word has been said in regard to my statements: None
</p>
<p>of them have been quoted or replied to. This is remarkable,
</p>
<p>because that newspaper had in that meeting a reporter. But
</p>
<p>it says: "A mentally blasted wretch, a mournful appendage of
</p>
<p>the Deseret News, named Nicholson [laughter], poured out
</p>
<p>his venom in the 12th Ward." Here is the argument with
</p>
<p>which I am answered. I am called "a mentally blasted
</p>
<p>wretch." [Laughter and applause.] Ladies and gentlemen,
</p>
<p>look upon me and take warning [renewed laughter and applause], and do not have the temerity at any time to fall upon
</p>
<p>the Tribune rock and get broken to pieces [applause]; for do
</p>
<p>you not see that the huge boulder is likely to roll over me,
</p>
<p>and, like the wheels of Juggernaut, grind ie to powder?
</p>
<p>[Applause.] I have been called names; but no argument has
</p>
<p>been adduced. I have been called "a liar," an "egregious
</p>
<p>ass" [laughter] and other things too numerous to mention;
</p>
<p>but never a word of the lecture. You are capable of judging
</p>
<p>whether I am "a mentally blasted wretch" or not. [Laughter]
</p>
<p>I think I can leave the verdict in your hands.
</p>
<p>I have been called, among other things, an alien. If there
</p>
<p>ever has been anything that I have prided myself upon it has
</p>
<p>been my birthplace, for I was born on this planet. I know no
</p>
<p>country but the earth; and I know no people but those who

<p>I have shown with some clearness I think-I hope you will

<p>has endeavored to wipe out in the Territory of Utah political

<p>and religious freedom, that a small minority might seize the

<p>reins of government, and despoil, and crush, and injure an

<p>innocent community. I denounce these as crimes against

<p>humanity; and I charge the perpetrators with being the genuine agents and operators of "organized crime" in Utah. [Loud

<p>AND ITS CA USES.
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>PASSAGES FROM1 THE FIRST
</p>
<p>LECTURE.
</p>
<p>IN the lecture delivered by Mr. Nicholson in the Twelfth
</p>
<p>Ward Assembly Rooms, on September 15th, the following
</p>
<p>passages occurred:
</p>
<p>THE SLAVERY HUMBUG.
</p>
<p>A great deal has been said about the "Mormons" being in a
</p>
<p>condition of slavery and serfdom, and these conspirators have a
</p>
<p>great deal of spmpathy for them on that account. They want
</p>
<p>to make them free; but the liberalizing process is very remarkable. They want to make them free by taking away all their
</p>
<p>political rights, and give them another kind of freedom-to visit
</p>
<p>the dens of infamy that have been established here and nurtured
</p>
<p>by them under the protest and against the active efforts of the
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints, without a dissenting voice on their part. That
</p>
<p>is the kind of freedom they want to introduce.
</p>
<p>But let us see how much freedom there is when you come to
</p>
<p>simmer it down in their own case. 'There was a man who took
</p>
<p>part in that Methodist religio-politico meeting held on the 7th of
</p>
<p>May, 1882, by the name of Jacob S. Boreman, formerly a judge
</p>
<p>of one of the judicial districts of this Territory. with his headquarters at Beaver. There was brought up before him while he
</p>
<p>acted in that capacity a "Mormon," by the name of Alonzo
</p>
<p>Colton. He was indicted under a Territorial statute that had no
</p>
<p>reference to polygamy whatever-a Territorial law against
</p>
<p>lascivious cohabitation-and in the face of the fact that he (Boreman) knew that this statute had no application to the case, but
</p>
<p>that it ought to have come under the law of the United States

</p>
<p>against bigamy and polygamy, passed by Congress in 1862, that
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>man was, in Jacob S. Boreman's court, convicted under the
</p>
<p>Territorial law that had no application, even if he were a polygamist. That is known and acknowledged by every man of all
</p>
<p>shades of opihion. It would be so admitted universally in this
</p>
<p>community to-day, except, perhaps, by the honorable gentleman
</p>
<p>himself. Yet he placed that man in the penitentiary through
</p>
<p>his bringing his Methodism on to the bench; and Colton served
</p>
<p>out a term of five years on a conviction brought under a law that
</p>
<p>had no application to the case. Colton's brother-in-law came up
</p>
<p>to this city some time after his incarceration. I met him several
</p>
<p>times. He drew out a petition for his release on the ground that
</p>
<p>he (Mr. Colton) was illegally convicted and unlawfully held in
</p>
<p>custody; that his conviction and imprisonment were an outrage.
</p>
<p>I saw the petition. It was taken to certain men that you and I
</p>
<p>know perfectly well-independent men who breathe the air of
</p>
<p>freedom of this great republic. But they did not sign it. They
</p>
<p>stated to the brother-in-law of Alonzo Colton, something after
</p>
<p>the language used to the "Mormons" by the late President Martin Van Buren-"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for
</p>
<p>you." They said, in effect, that they dared not affix their signatures to that paper for fear of the Tribune getting after them
</p>
<p>They were so free and independent. You understand the balance. I could give you the names of those parties, but I do not
</p>
<p>wish to be too personal. This is the freedom enjoyed by the
</p>
<p>conspirators against the peace and freedom of the people of
</p>
<p>Utah.
</p>
<p>In fact the whip of the conspirators, through their organ and
</p>
<p>the medium of public harangues, has been constantly cracked
</p>
<p>over the heads of decent men who have in the slightest manner
</p>
<p>protested against their outrageous operations against the "Mormons," until they have either been forced into line or into a
</p>
<p>silence under which they have chafed, because of the perpetual
</p>
<p>outrage upon their ideas of fair play. And yet these conspirators will talk of freedom, and talk with spread-eagle loftiness
</p>
<p>about the sweets of liberty.
</p>
<p>THE MORALITY PLEA.
</p>
<p>Let us enquire a little further into the comparative morality of
</p>
<p>"Mormons" and non-Mormons, as exhibited by the official statistics of two of the chief cities of Utah. In the year 1882 the
</p>
<p>total number of arrests made in Salt Lake City, by the municipal
</p>
<p>police, for crimes of every class, was 1,640; of these law-breakers

</p>
<p>446 were "Mormons" and 1,194 non-Mormons, yet the latter con
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>stitute but one-fourth of the population. They furnished, however, three-fourths of the criminality. In 1883 the arrests
</p>
<p>amounted to 1,609 in all. Only 150 were "Mormons" and the
</p>
<p>remaining 1,459 non-Mormons.
</p>
<p>Ogden makes a still more striking exhibit in the same direction. In 1881 the relative population was 85 per cent. "Mormons" to 15 per cent. non-Mormons. The arrests numbered
</p>
<p>211. Of the persons arrested 21 were "Mormons," the remaining
</p>
<p>190 being non-Mormons.
</p>
<p>In 1882 the arrests numbered 306, the relative proportion being
</p>
<p>22 "Mormons," to 284 non-Mormons.
</p>
<p>In 1883 the arrests footed up 537, with a score of 74 for the lawless "Mormons" and 463 for the non-Mormons. In the last
</p>
<p>mnaed year the proportion of "Mormons" in the population was
</p>
<p>closely estimated at 71 per cent. "Mormons," leaving 29 per
</p>
<p>cent. non-Mormons.
</p>
<p>These figures are eloquent; they speak in thunder tones, rendering comments upon their showing superfluous.
</p>
<p>THE RESPONSIBILITY.
</p>
<p>I might refer to cases of mobbing, and driving, and murder
</p>
<p>that have been the direct result of the publication of false statements formulated by men in this city. I was informed but
</p>
<p>yesterday by Joseph H. Parry that when he was laboring in the
</p>
<p>Southern States, in the same district where Joseph Standing was
</p>
<p>laboring, that the cause of the excitement that resulted in the
</p>
<p>death of the latter, was, that in the Journal of Education were
</p>
<p>published certain averments by J. M. Coyner. The cue was
</p>
<p>taken from these statements by the sectarian preachers of that
</p>
<p>region; those preachers by anti-Mormon harangues worked the
</p>
<p>people into such a frenzy that that murder was the result, and
</p>
<p>the blood spots of Joseph Standing are upon the skirts of J. M.
</p>
<p>Coyner, he being, according to Efder Parry's evidence, one of
</p>
<p>the indirect causes of that foul assassination.
</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF R. G. McNIECE.
</p>
<p>"It was also about eighteen months ago that our chapel and
</p>
<p>school-building in Logan was set on fire. Some one climbed in
</p>
<p>at the window and having poured coal-oil on the floor, set it on
</p>
<p>fire. The fire went out; but the next morning the burned floor
</p>
<p>\ and the mark of the coal-oil showed too plainly that the purpose
</p>
<p>was to burn the building."

</p>
<p>"Said N. W. Crookston further deposes and says, 'On the morning of December 1st, A. D., 1882, I was notified that an attempt
</p>
<p>to burn the Presbyterian church in Logan had been made during
</p>
<p>the previous night. 1 went to the church with County Attorney
</p>
<p>Maughan. Found a quantity of kindling wood saturated with
</p>
<p>coal-oil on the floor of the bell tower. The wood had evidently
</p>
<p>been thrown there through a window and the coal-oil, afterwards
</p>
<p>found on it, from the window, and a lighted match dropped in
</p>
<p>on it. A bench used as a seat was charred, the carpet covering
</p>
<p>on it was burned and some of the kindling wood was also charred. Rev. 0. M. Parks, pastor of the church, told me that on the
</p>
<p>previous evening there had been an entertainmentin the church,
</p>
<p>being Thanksgiving evening; that one, Wm. Buder, came to the

<p>entertainment drunk, and that he (Parks) asked him to leave,

<p>much alarmed.

<p>THE OLD STYLE.
</p>
<p>To-day we print a verbatim report of an address delivered by
</p>
<p>Bishop West at Juab on the 9th inst., as forwarded by a friend.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>It reads like the old-day Tabernacle harangues, and the devout
</p>
<p>brethren and sisters of the former time would have warmly enjoyed and commended it as being 'full of the sperret," indeed,
</p>
<p>we are not sure but away down deep in their hearts they will
</p>
<p>approve it now. It is a very violent harangue, full of bitter malice and the usual untruths of the fanatics when they undertake
</p>
<p>to deal with subjects wherein they are opposed. The common
</p>
<p>dreary twaddle of exclusive holiness and a monopoly of honesty
</p>
<p>is disgustingly paraded by this dishonest parasite in behalf of a
</p>
<p>set of rogues whose crimes, peculations, public and private,
</p>
<p>robberies and unblushing piracies are the amazement of every
</p>
<p>one who has had to do with the facts. No spot in the Mormon
</p>
<p>administration, from the tithing yards to the county and Territorial treasuries could bear thelight of day. Elder West's main
</p>
<p>insistence was, in p!ain words, that it was the command of the
</p>
<p>Lord, communicated through Joseph Smith, "the martyr," in a
</p>
<p>vision, about the beginning of the present month, to himself
</p>
<p>(West), that Governor Murray must be assassinated, and that
</p>
<p>his successor must in like manner be "removed," until the Gentiles were faint with terror, and let the Saints alone to manage
</p>
<p>"their own kingdom" in their own way. Of course the howling
</p>
<p>of such a noisy blatherskite in that vein simply means that he is
</p>
<p>filled with a murderous hate, but is too cowardly to himself to do
</p>
<p>the deed he undertakes to spur others up to commit. There is no
</p>
<p>danger from him, and even in the worst times the brethren had
</p>
<p>too much discretion and wholesome fear of the consequencies to
</p>
<p>undertake any such villainous programme. In former years
</p>
<p>Elder West would, however, have been sure of promotion in the
</p>
<p>church for his efforts, especially if they had been well kept up,
</p>
<p>for the sect in its wretched development of Brighamism has need
</p>
<p>of such tools. He starts in too late in the day, however, and will
</p>
<p>neither win cross, which he might have won in Jackson county,
</p>
<p>Missouri, nor crown, which he might have gained during the
</p>
<p>fanatical "reformation" which led up to the Mountain Meadow
</p>
<p>massacre.
</p>
<p>As this notorious fabrication has created considerable interest
</p>
<p>on account of the murderous mischief it has created, it is here

<p>of the devil and his fiery imps at the capitol of this God-forsaken

<p>of Christ, and the day of judgment is at hand, and it's our turn
</p>
<p>then if it isn't now, which I say it is. When Gabriel sounds his
</p>
<p>trumpet on that awful day, the Gentile hellhounds will find the
</p>
<p>Saints of God have got all the front seats reserved, and that they
</p>
<p>can't find standing room for themselves in the gallery. The
</p>
<p>cause is flourishing in the Juab Stake of Zion, and many souls
</p>
<p>are being daily rescued from the flames of heathenism. If I
</p>
<p>had my way not a house would be left standing which sheltered
</p>
<p>a knavish Gentile. They are eyesores in the sight of the Lord
</p>
<p>and His vengeance is sure to come. They persecute His Saints
</p>
<p>Aind He has commanded them to destroy their persecutors. He
</p>
<p>has commanded the Saints to rid the earth of the sin-besmudged
</p>
<p>heretic. He has revealed unto us the foundation of the Gentile
</p>
<p>Church that it is the devil. (II Nephi ch. 4, verse xx.) Hell is
</p>
<p>filled with the scurrilous Gentiles and the floors of hell are
</p>
<p>paved with the skulls of apostates. He who kills a Gentile rids
</p>
<p>the earth of a serpent and adds a star to his own crown, The
</p>
<p>Saints are Gathering together from sea to sea and they will rise
</p>
<p>in their awful might and fall upon the enemies of Zion. Let the
</p>
<p>tabernacles resound with joyful voices for the fulfillment of the
</p>
<p>prophecies of Moroni are at hand. The minions of the devil
</p>
<p>are set loose in our midst by the crime soaked politicians who
</p>
<p>rule our land. The shades of the sainted martyr Smith call
</p>
<p>aloud for vengeance at the hands of his followers. The blood of
</p>
<p>the Gentile persecutors shall be spilled on their own thresholds to
</p>
<p>appease the anger of our prophet. Tune the lyre and beat the
</p>
<p>cymbals; for oif revenge is now at hand. We will wipe out the
</p>
<p>scum of the.Washington blood suckers and the high priest of
</p>
<p>the devil who assumes to rule in our very midst shall be cut off
</p>
<p>with a sharp instrument. The thieving Murray issues orders to
</p>
<p>the Saints of God, and defies every one but the devil, who is
</p>
<p>his sponsor. His head will be placed upon the walls of our city and
</p>
<p>his entrails scattered throughout the street of Zion, that every

<p>to pursue our road to Paradise unmolested. Our strength is
</p>
<p>greater than the world believes and our will is powerful and
</p>
<p>undaunted by heretic menaces. The Lord is our shepherd and
</p>
<p>we cannot fail. The red man is our firm ally and he thirsts for
</p>
<p>the blood of the enemy of Zion. We are powerful and unassailable in our mountain home and we will roll the massive boulders
</p>
<p>of destruction down from the mountain tops upon the heads of
</p>
<p>the unregenerate. Our secret places are stored with crafty explosives with which we will surely destroy the strongholds of the
</p>
<p>government of Satan. Our young men are drilling for the
</p>
<p>conflict, and our wives and daughters are making themselves
</p>
<p>ready to minister to our wants, and the day is close at hand.
</p>
<p>Let the Gentile leeches and poltroons beware and win our forbearance, if yet they may. The Lord is sorely angered at our
</p>
<p>persecutors, and He has said to our counselors in a vision that
</p>
<p>He will deliver our enemy into our hands as He delivered Laban
</p>
<p>into the hands of Nephi. He will visit the earth, through us,
</p>
<p>with a worse destruction than He did in the days of the flood,
</p>
<p>and the ungodly will bite the dust.with rage, and their blood
</p>
<p>will flow in the streets of Zion even as much as the waters in-the

</p>
<p>day of Noah. Behold, I declare unto you, all ye Saints who
</p>
<p>revere the memory of the Prophets, that you must begin to gird
</p>
<p>up your loins and whet your knives. Let the religious fervor of
</p>
<p>the Saints who are dead and gone recur to your weaker spirits
</p>
<p>and fire you with the zeal of the destroying angels. EliMurray
</p>
<p>is the Cain of our generation. He hates our people and he
</p>
<p>works for our destruction that he may win for himself a reputation of valor among the ungodly. He is a damned scoundrel,
</p>
<p>and a pestiferous leper. He is the polluted scum of corruption.
</p>
<p>He reeks with ungodliness, and he is rotten with heresy. I command every true disciple of Christ to watch out for this damned
</p>
<p>Yankee interloper, and ye know that there is protection enough
</p>
<p>for you in Zion if ye kill the whole Gentile race. Last night, as
</p>
<p>I lay in my bed thinking over the affairs of the Church, and
</p>
<p>possessed of a strange restlessness, and praying the while for
</p>
<p>inspiration from the Most High, that I might see the way more
</p>
<p>clearly to a sure release of my brethren from bondage, behold a
</p>
<p>great and glorious light suddenly filled my apartment with a
</p>
<p>glow brighter than the sun. I was at first afraid, ond inclined
</p>
<p>strongly to leap from my bed and flee. But of a sudden I heard
</p>
<p>a voice which caused my heart to beat with tumultuous joy, for
</p>
<p>it was that of Joseph Smith. I gazed at him earnestly, expecting and hanging on the words which should perchance fall from
</p>
<p>his lips, and I beheld that his garments were of a dazzling whiteness, and that his skin was of a dazzling and heavenly whiteness,
</p>
<p>save the blood-red spots and livid wounds where the bullets of
</p>
<p>the cursed Gentiles had entered his sainted body, and which
</p>
<p>were now visible to their eternal damnation, as were the marks
</p>
<p>of the nails which pierced the hands and feet of Christ. Joseph
</p>
<p>spoke to me in a voice of wondrous sweetness blended with
</p>
<p>strains of the direst severity when he spoke of the fate in store
</p>
<p>for those Saints who neglected what he should now command
</p>
<p>them. Joseph bade me to cast my eyes about and behold the
</p>
<p>presence in the midst of the Saints of an emissary of the devil.
</p>
<p>It was the will of the Most High that this man should be removed,
</p>
<p>and if other emissaries were chosen to fill his place, even as many
</p>
<p>as were so chosen should be similarly dealt with. If allowed to
</p>
<p>remain in our midst, the sin would be on our heads. for it was

</p>
<p>the command of the Most High God of Abraham and Isaac. It
</p>
<p>lay in our power to be our own rulers, and our cowardice was
</p>
<p>the cause of sore distress to the departed Saints who had left us
</p>
<p>a kingdom. Eli H. Murray was possessed of a devil. and had
</p>
<p>only the outward semblance of a man. He should and must be
</p>
<p>trod upon until his bowels gushed out in the streets. The incarnate fiend lurked invisibly behind his hellish disciple, and was
</p>
<p>intent upon the destruction of Zion. The time was short, and
</p>
<p>vigorous and immediate action premptory The curses of eternal
</p>
<p>damnation awaited those who failed in this holy mission. The
</p>
<p>work must not stop at the destruction of one of these hell-hounds,
</p>
<p>these Erebus-like pestilences in the folds of the anointed, but
</p>
<p>must extend even to the farthermost corners of the earth, until
</p>
<p>every heretic out of hell was sent home, and the Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints were rulers of the land. Much more the beloved Joseph
</p>
<p>said to me which I am commanded not to reveal unto you until

<p>divine commands go unheeded. 1 call upon you who sit there

<p>trembling in your seats to beware, and to rise in your strength

<p>and win your crown. Let every Saint in Zion be present at the

<p>March 18, 1884.
</p>
<p>Editor Deseret News:
</p>
<p>Please pardon me for referring to a sheet published in
</p>
<p>your city, called the "Salt Lake Tribune," although I do not
</p>
<p>presurie that it is sustained by any respectable person in this
</p>
<p>Territory where it has so unenviable a reputation: still it may be
</p>
<p>sent abroad and fall into the hands of some simple-minded persons who might perhaps be deluded into the impression tlat it
</p>
<p>was a truthful sheet, or reliable authority. Not that I think for
</p>
<p>a moment that any sane person would be so woefully deceived.
</p>
<p>I wish to refer to a manufactured sensational piece in the issue
</p>
<p>of Sunday the 16th inst.. that has been called to my attention,
</p>
<p>headed a ''Red-Hot Address;" also a short editorial on the subject in which the truthful (?) editor states it had been "forwarded
</p>
<p>by a friend." 0, tempore! 0. mores! It purports to be a "stenographical report of Bishop West's harangue in the Juab schoolhouse, Sunday March 9. 1884, reported by 'Tobias Tobey' for the
</p>
<p>Salt Lake Tribune." Then follows an address which charity
</p>
<p>would suggest had been written by an insane person or worse,
</p>
<p>the offspring of a dreadfully corrupt heart, a miserable disgrace
</p>
<p>to the genus homo, worthy only to rise to "shame and everlasting contempt."
</p>
<p>Now, the facts are these: It is all a gross fabrication, Juab
</p>
<p>is a small town occupied by hotel and boarding house keepers, a
</p>
<p>store or two and the railroad hands; there is a small branch of
</p>
<p>the Church, presided over by Elder James Wilson. who is very
</p>
<p>much respected, but no bishop. On the Sunday referred to there
</p>
<p>had been a wash-out and all the hands were busy, so that there

</p>
<p>was no meeting held on that day; and as far as the "Bishop
</p>
<p>West" is concerned, there is no such bishop there or in the "Mormon" Church, and who "Tobias Tobey" is no one knows.
</p>
<p>I have been requested to inform you of these facts, and kindly
</p>
<p>request that you will waive any feeling of dislike you may have
</p>
<p>to, in any way, refer to the existence of such a sheet, for the
</p>
<p>sake of our young Elders on missions, who might perchance
</p>
<p>meet with this shockingly vile fabrication.
</p>
<p>Very Respectfully,

</p>
<p>WHAT UTAH WANTS.
</p>
<p>The Salt Lake Tribune of March 6th, 1881, had an editorial
</p>
<p>headed, "What Utah Wants," from which we make the following
</p>
<p>extracts:
</p>
<p>"Apropos of the new and petty war recently started by the
</p>
<p>municipal government on the women of the town, the liquor
</p>
<p>dealers and the gambling fraternity, one of the 'enemy' said to
</p>
<p>us the other day: 'It may be a hard thing to say, and perhaps
</p>
<p>harder still to maintain, but I believe that billiard halls, saloons
</p>
<p>and houses of ill-fame are more powerful reforming agencies
</p>
<p>here in Utah than churches and schools, or even than the
</p>
<p>Tribune. What the youug Mormons wantis to be freed. So long
</p>
<p>as they are slaves, it matters not much to what or to whom, they
</p>
<p>are and they can be nothing. Your churches are as enslaving
</p>
<p>as the Mormon Church. Your party is as bigoted and intolerant
</p>
<p>as the Mormon party. At all events I rejoice when I see the
</p>
<p>young Mormon hoodlums playing billiards, getting drunk,
</p>
<p>running with bad women-anything to break the shackles they
</p>
<p>were born in, and that every so-called religious or virtuous
</p>
<p>influence only makes the stronger. Some of them will go quite
</p>
<p>to the bad, of course, but it is better so, for they are made of
</p>
<p>poor stuff, and since there is no good reason why they were
</p>
<p>begun for let them soon be done for, and the sooner the better.
</p>
<p>Most of them, however, will soon weary of vice and dissipation,
</p>
<p>and be all the stronger for the knowledge of it and of its vanity.
</p>
<p>At the very least they will be free, and it is of such vital
</p>
<p>consequence that a man should be free, that in my opinion his
</p>
<p>freedom is cheaply won at the cost of some familiarity with low
</p>
<p>life. And while it is not desirable in itself, it is to me tolerable,
</p>
<p>because it appears to offer the only inducement strong enough to
</p>
<p>entice men out of slavery into freedom.'
</p>
<p>So far, the Tribune's pretended quotation. Now for its own
</p>
<p>comments, in the same article:
</p>
<p>"Freedom is thefirst requisite of manhood, and if it can be

</p>
<p>won without excesses so much the better. If it can't, never mind
</p>
<p>the excesses, win the freedom. It is not you who are responsible, when it comes to that; it is those who have enslaved you.
</p>
<p>Who is the national hero of the yeomanry of England but Robin
</p>
<p>Hood, 'waging war against the men of law, against bishops and
</p>
<p>archbishops, whose sway was so heavy; generous, moreover;
</p>
<p>giving a poor, ruined knight clothes, horse and money to buy
</p>
<p>back the land he had pledged to a rapacious Abbott; compas

</p>

</p>
<p>sionate, too, and kind to the poor, enjoining his men not to injure
</p>
<p>yeomen and laborers, but above all rash, bold, proud, who would
</p>
<p>go to draw his bow before the sheriffs eyes and to his face; ready
</p>
<p>with blows, whether to give or take.'
</p>
<p>"Read the first chapter of Book Two of Taine's English
</p>
<p>Literature, if you would see what ails Utah, and what it needs
</p>
<p>as a medicament."
</p>
<p>"To vent the feelings, to satisfy the heart and eyes, to set free
</p>
<p>boldly on all the roads of existence, the pack of appetites and
</p>
<p>instincts, this was the craving which the manners of the time
</p>
<p>betrayed. It was 'merry England,' as they called it then. It
</p>
<p>was not yet stern and constrained. It expanded widely, freely,
</p>
<p>and rejoiced to find itself so expanded."
</p>
<p>"Let the people of Utah rise out of the dust, stand upright,
</p>
<p>inquire within, lean on themselves, look about them, and try in
</p>
<p>a large way to be men, as they were born to be. Let them know
</p>
<p>nobody more puissant than themselves. What is a game of
</p>
<p>billiards, a glass of beer, a cup of coffee, cigar, or other petty
</p>
<p>vice, in the span of a strong human life, filled with endeavor in
</p>
<p>the right direction? The Territory, like the rest of the land, is
</p>
<p>still in in its infancy, still in the pulp of babyhood. It has yet
</p>
<p>to be made. There is work for men, whose first and last quality
</p>
<p>is strength. manliness. The day of trifles, and of crouching
</p>
<p>and cowardice, of criminal surrender to the first howling dervish
</p>
<p>who calls himself a priest and presumes to speak in the name of
</p>
<p>the Almighty, has lasted long enough. Let a new era dawn in

<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>THERE is a general misunderstanding in the
</p>
<p>public mind in reference to nearly every subject
</p>
<p>connected with "Mormonism." Particularly is
</p>
<p>this the case in regard to "Mormon" doctrine on
</p>
<p>the taking of human life. It is popularly supposed that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints authorizes and justifies the killing of
</p>
<p>men and women for apostasy, or for any grave act
</p>
<p>in opposition to its interests. This is called "blood
</p>
<p>atonement" by unprincipled writers and lecturers
</p>
<p>who wish to deceive the public, and many people
</p>
<p>believe that this is really one of the tenets of this
</p>
<p>Church. The Mountain Meadows Massacre has
</p>
<p>been made to do active duty in the work of
</p>
<p>deception. It has been charged to the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church and the "Mormon" leaders so many times
</p>
<p>and in so many places that any attempt to present the facts seems almost like labor in vain.
</p>
<p>And yet to allow these falsehoods to go unrefutedrappears wrong and impolitic. They should
</p>
<p>be met and overturned for the benefit of the few
</p>
<p>among mankind who prefer the truth to deception and love light rather than darkness. It
</p>
<p>was for the purpose of aiding in the correction
</p>
<p>of error concerning these subjects that the author

</p>
<p>Lake City, on the subjectof "Blood Atonement,"
</p>
<p>and another two weeks later on "The Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows Massacre." In the former address the
</p>
<p>doctrine of the Church on the shedding of human
</p>
<p>blood was explained and substantiated and popular errors exposed, by reference to the Church
</p>
<p>standards and the sermons of leading Elders.
</p>
<p>In the latter address the responsibility of the
</p>
<p>terrible crime committed at an early date in
</p>
<p>this Territory was traced to its true source, and
</p>
<p>numerous references were made to anti-Mormon
</p>
<p>works, and documents of unimpeachable authenticity and veracity were introduced for the first
</p>
<p>time in a public assembly. These addresses have
</p>
<p>now been published, by request, in pamphlet
</p>
<p>form, and are submitted to the world for the
</p>
<p>perusal and judgment of thinking men and women everywhere. And the blessing of the Author
</p>
<p>of all truth and light is invoked upon these
</p>
<p>simple but earnest efforts to enlighten mankind,
</p>
<p>to the end that prejudice may be dispelled, to
</p>
<p>make way for the everlasting truths which a
</p>
<p>maligned and misunderstood Church has a mission to proclaim for the salvation of man and

<p>THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS
</p>
<p>MASSACRE.
</p>
<p>THE subject upon which I have to speak this
</p>
<p>evening has attracted a great deal of attention. It
</p>
<p>has been mentioned, I think, in every part of the
</p>
<p>civilized world. Wherever our Elders have gone
</p>
<p>abroad to preach the gospel of Christ they have
</p>
<p>been met with the statement that the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church, with Brigham Young at its head, is a
</p>
<p>bloody church; that it not only teaches, but practices the doctrine of shedding human blood for
</p>
<p>apostasy; that there is an organization in the
</p>
<p>midst of the people called "Danites" or "Destroying Angels," * whose business it is to kill everyone
</p>
<p>who attempts to escape from Utah, or any obnoxious person, "Mormon" or Gentile, who may come
</p>
<p>into the midst of the people. This has been denied
</p>
<p>frequently, and those who have made these statements have been challenged to the proof. The
</p>
<p>proof, of course, has not been forthcoming, because
</p>
<p>the charge is a falsehood. Still, wherever our
</p>
<p>Elders go they meet with a statement of this kind,
</p>
<p>and particularly is the cry of "The Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows Massacre" raised against them. It is

<p>claimed that that awful tragedy was performed
</p>
<p>by the "Mormon" Church, or that the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church is responsible for it; that it was perpetrated at the command of Brigham Young as the
</p>
<p>leader of the Church, and that it was in accordance with the doctrines of the Church.
</p>
<p>This untruth has been repeated so many times
</p>
<p>that the world, who are not acquainted with our
</p>
<p>principles and our acts, have come to believe in a
</p>
<p>great measure that it is true. It has been proclaimed by the press repeatedly. Over and over
</p>
<p>again the Mountain Meadow massacre has been
</p>
<p>charged to the "Mormon" Church, and particularly
</p>
<p>to its former President. Ministers in the pulpit
</p>
<p>have found this a convenient weapon wherewith
</p>
<p>to oppose the Elders of the Church in the preaching of the gospel. They could not refute the arguments which they brought forth, they could not
</p>
<p>overturn the doctrines which they preached, and
</p>
<p>so stories like those I have mentioned have been
</p>
<p>told from the pulpit, over and over again, to prejudice the public mind against the Elders of the
</p>
<p>Church. Wherever the servants of God have gone
</p>
<p>to preach the gospel, the Mountain Meadow massacre has been thrown in their teeth.
</p>
<p>Now, this evening I will endeavor to give a brief
</p>
<p>account of this terrible occurrence, and then, if
</p>
<p>possible, to trace up the responsibility for it, show
</p>
<p>who perpetrated it, who were the guilty parties, so

<p>sory before the fact, or an accessory after the fact;
</p>
<p>and whether the charge that has been made
</p>
<p>against the "Mormon" people has any foundation
</p>
<p>in fact. I hope I shall have the assistance in
</p>
<p>doing this of the faith of my brethren and sisters,
</p>
<p>that I may have the Spirit of the Lord to rest
</p>
<p>upon me to quicken my mind, to give me grasp of
</p>
<p>thought, so that I may be able to bring forward
</p>
<p>clearly those evidences which I have been able to
</p>
<p>collect, and put them before the people in an intelligent shape so that all can understand
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>In the Summer of 1857, a company of emigrants, as stated by some, composed of two parties,
</p>
<p>one from Missouri and the other from Arkansas,
</p>
<p>came into Salt Lake City. They were on their way
</p>
<p>to California. After staying here a short time,
</p>
<p>they were advised to take the northern route to
</p>
<p>California by way of Bear river. There were two
</p>
<p>routes by which the stream of emigration flowed
</p>
<p>to the west from this point. One was northward,
</p>
<p>and the other south and westward. They were
</p>
<p>advised by Elder Charles C. Rich to go by the
</p>
<p>northern route. They went as far as Bear River,
</p>
<p>but returned and concluded to take the southern
</p>
<p>route. On their way south they became very impertinent and abusive. At that time news had
</p>
<p>been received here of the approach of Buchanan's
</p>
<p>army, supposed to be coming here to destroy the
</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints, to endeavor to break up "Mormonism," and to execute the atrocious threats which
</p>
<p>had been made by the soldiery in their camps on

<p>the plains, news of which had been brought here
</p>
<p>by runners.
</p>
<p>These emigrants boasted to the people as they
</p>
<p>passed through the settlements that they were
</p>
<p>going to California, where they intended to get up
</p>
<p>a company and return and attack our people in
</p>
<p>the south when the army arrived in Salt Lake
</p>
<p>City. It is related that on the way, when going
</p>
<p>through small settlements-it was a large company, 120 to 150 persons, differently estimatedthey would rob hen-roosts, and passing through
</p>
<p>the streets would flip off the heads of chickens
</p>
<p>with their whip-thongs. At one place, it is related,
</p>
<p>they poisoned the springs, so that the people who
</p>
<p>partook of the water died in consequence thereof.
</p>
<p>Still further, it is said that they poisoned beef and
</p>
<p>gave it to the Indians, and several Indians died
</p>
<p>from its effects, and at another place they caught
</p>
<p>an Indian, tied him up to a wagon wheel and
</p>
<p>whipped him severely. These are the stories
</p>
<p>which were told concerning these emigrants; whether they are true or false I am unable to say, but
</p>
<p>these were the stories told concerning them, and
</p>
<p>the people believed them. The Indians became
</p>
<p>very much enraged, and as this company traveled
</p>
<p>further and further south the rage of the Indians
</p>
<p>increased. On the way they met Jacob Bamblin
</p>
<p>and asked him-as a resident of this Territory, a
</p>
<p>man well acquainted with the country, who had
</p>
<p>been among the Indians a great deal-which was
</p>
<p>the best place to camp in a certain region, and he

</p>
<p>told them the Mountain Meadows, at the north part
</p>
<p>MASSA CR E.

</p>
<p>of which he had a ranch. They went on and
</p>
<p>camped at the Mountain Meadows. But, as I told
</p>
<p>you, all the way down they were committing these
</p>
<p>depredations, by which not only were the settlers
</p>
<p>very much aggrieved, but the Indians were aroused
</p>
<p>to the greatest indignation and fury. When they
</p>
<p>arrived at Mountain Meadows they were attacked
</p>
<p>by Indians, but they entrenched themselves; they
</p>
<p>threw up earthworks to the level of the hubs of
</p>
<p>their wagon wheels, and prepared to defend themselves as in a state of siege. According to the evidence presented, it appears that John D. Lee was at
</p>
<p>that time a member of the Church-not a Bishop,
</p>
<p>by the way, I understand he never was a Bishop,
</p>
<p>but was a member of the Church and looked after
</p>
<p>the interests of a great number of Indians in that
</p>
<p>part of the country as Indian farmer. It is stated
</p>
<p>that John D. Lee led the first attack of the Indians
</p>
<p>against those emigrants. About this time a council was held at Cedar City at which were present
</p>
<p>Isaac C. Haight, Philip Klingensmith, who was the
</p>
<p>acting Bishop, a man by the name of Laban Morill, and some others. These persons at this council took into consideration the depredations which
</p>
<p>had been made by this party of emigrants.
</p>
<p>You must understand that the people were very
</p>
<p>much excited at this time. The news of the coming of the army had reached different parts of the
</p>
<p>Territory, and a plan had been prepared, if they
</p>
<p>should come into the Territory, to burn down
</p>
<p>our houses, to destroy our property and leave

</p>
<p>pie to flee to the mountains and leave.nothing as
</p>
<p>a prey to their enemies. The people were getting
</p>
<p>ready for this emergency. You must remember
</p>
<p>also that the people living here in that early period
</p>
<p>had been driven from different parts of the United
</p>
<p>States, time and time again, for their religion;
</p>
<p>they had suffered untold hardships, privations and
</p>
<p>persecutions, and now the prospects were that an
</p>
<p>army was coming in upon them to drive them out
</p>
<p>again, or pull them up, root and branch, and
</p>
<p>destroy them. Of course there was a great deal of
</p>
<p>excitement at the time, and this body of emigrants
</p>
<p>having made those threats, cursing Brigham
</p>
<p>Young, declaring that "old Joe Smith ought to
</p>
<p>have been killed before he was," some of them declaring that they had taken part in his assassination, naturally aroused the anger of the people.
</p>
<p>Well, this council was held in Cedar City to determine what was best to be done, whether or not to
</p>
<p>intercept them and prevent the emigrants from
</p>
<p>going further south. Some person present on that
</p>
<p>occasion advocated their interception and destruction. Laban Morill and some others were of a
</p>
<p>different mind, stating that the proper thing to do
</p>
<p>was to send a messenger to Governor Young to
</p>
<p>find out what his advice was concerning this matter, and to desist from doing anything of a hostile
</p>
<p>nature until word was received from Governor
</p>
<p>Young. A messenger was despatched on the 7th
</p>
<p>day of September, 1857. His name was James

<p>Haslam. He came to Salt Lake City, saw President Young, delivered his message and a letter
</p>
<p>MA SSA CRE.
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>from Isaac C. Haight, and received a despatch from
</p>
<p>President Young to take back, and he was told to
</p>
<p>"spare no horse-flesh"-to go "with all speed" and
</p>
<p>deliver the despatch as quickly as possible. That
</p>
<p>despatch was delivered to Isaac C. Haightat Cedar
</p>
<p>City on the following Sunday, which, according to
</p>
<p>the dates that I have traced up, must have been
</p>
<p>on the 13th day of September. Isaac C. Haight's
</p>
<p>answer was, "It is too late." It appears that a
</p>
<p>number of men had been called by Philip Klingensmith, the acting Bishop, and John M. Higbee, who claimed to be acting under orders of
</p>
<p>Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, to go to the
</p>
<p>Mountain Meadow. According to the testimony
</p>
<p>delivered at the trials, to which I will refer presently, most of these men had not the least idea
</p>
<p>that they were going to Mountain Meadow to perform any deed of blood or to commit anything
</p>
<p>wrong. They expected to be gone two or three
</p>
<p>days. Some of the emigrants had been killed by
</p>
<p>the Indians and they expected they were going to
</p>
<p>help bury the dead. When they arrived there,
</p>
<p>according to the testimony given at the trial of
</p>
<p>John D. Lee, a man was sent down into the camp
</p>
<p>of the emigrants with a white flag, or a flag of
</p>
<p>truce. Afterwards John D. Lee went down and
</p>
<p>had some conversation with the emigrants, and
</p>
<p>they were induced to give up their arms, which
</p>
<p>were placed in wagons and they were all drawn out
</p>
<p>of the camp. Wnen they had passed a considerable
</p>
<p>distance away, the Indians, and it is said some of

</p>
<p>1MO UNTAIN MEAD 0 WS
</p>
<p>all butchered, men and women, and none were
</p>
<p>saved but about seventeen small children, the oldest seven years of age. It is related that John D.
</p>
<p>Lee assisted in the slaughtering of the wounded
</p>
<p>emigrants who were in the wagons; those who
</p>
<p>were able to walk, marching without arms, were
</p>
<p>set upon by the Indians and, as stated, some white
</p>
<p>men fired among them. But it appears that John
</p>
<p>D. Lee assisted in the killing of the wounded persons, so that all the men, and the women, and the
</p>
<p>older children were slain; there were none left but
</p>
<p>the seventeen little children, who were taken and
</p>
<p>distributed around among the people, until Forney, the Indian agent, some time afterwards came
</p>
<p>and gathered them up and took them away.
</p>
<p>Now, I have endeavored to tell you, as briefly as
</p>
<p>possible, the dreadful story of the massacre. It
</p>
<p>was a horrible affair. It makes one's blood run
</p>
<p>cold to think of such a slaughter. One hundred
</p>
<p>and twenty persons-some say one hundred and
</p>
<p>nineteen, but it is generally conceded to be about
</p>
<p>one hundred and twenty-inhumanly butchered.
</p>
<p>They were murdered. No one can palliate the
</p>
<p>crime. I would not attempt to do so. No circumstances that existed at that time could, in my
</p>
<p>mind, palliate that dreadful deed. And to think
</p>
<p>that any white person should be engaged in it is
</p>
<p>most horrible to my mind, most repugnant to my
</p>
<p>feelings, and I know it is repugnant to the feelings
</p>
<p>of my brethren and sisters, not only those present

</p>
<p>Now, this terrible crime is laid at the door of
</p>
<p>the Church because certain individuals, who were
</p>
<p>then members of the Church, were engaged in this
</p>
<p>horrible massacre. This has always appeared to
</p>
<p>me to be very unjust. Why should the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
</p>
<p>Saints, be held responsible for the crimes of a few
</p>
<p>of its members any more than other churches for
</p>
<p>the crimes of a few of their members? The Roman Catholic church for the deeds alleged to have
</p>
<p>been done by members of that church; the church
</p>
<p>of England, the Episcopal church, for the deeds
</p>
<p>done by men belonging to that church in early
</p>
<p>times, and some in later times? Why should the
</p>
<p>different denominations of the day, as religious
</p>
<p>denominations, as churches, be charged with the
</p>
<p>weaknesses, the corruptions and the diabolical
</p>
<p>deeds perpetrated, not only by members of these
</p>
<p>denominations, but by persons who officiate therein
</p>
<p>as ministers? Sensible people do not lay these
</p>
<p>crimes at the door of the denomination to which
</p>
<p>the individuals may belong, but charge them home
</p>
<p>to the individuals themselves. They are responsible for their acts, they alone should be charged
</p>
<p>with them, unless-unless what they do is taught
</p>
<p>by the church to which they belong, or is allowed
</p>
<p>by that church, or is in consonance with any of its
</p>
<p>doctrines. If it can be shown that the Church of
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches the people to commit murder; if it can be shown that the
</p>
<p>Church, as a religious body, ordered that massacre,
</p>
<p>or, after it occurred, condoned it, palliated it, or

<p>agreed that it was right, considered it was proper,
</p>
<p>then we may lay this crime upon the Church and
</p>
<p>claim that the Church is responsible for it. But if
</p>
<p>the Church teaches to the contrary, if the spirit of
</p>
<p>the whole people is against such deeds of blood, if
</p>
<p>it can be shown that in doing these dreadful things
</p>
<p>such white persons as were members of this Church
</p>
<p>who were guilty, actually violated the laws of the
</p>
<p>Church, then I say that the crime cannot be reasonably and consistently laid upon the Church as
</p>
<p>a body.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stenhouse, in his work called 'Rocky Mountain Saints," says that no sane person ever did lay
</p>
<p>the crime at the door of the Church. Now, I
</p>
<p>would like to refer you to a few of the charges that
</p>
<p>have been made concerning this crime, laying it
</p>
<p>upon the Church and people, and particularly upon
</p>
<p>Brigham Young; because if it is true that the
</p>
<p>charge has not been made against the Church,
</p>
<p>then there is no need for me to make any rebuttal;
</p>
<p>but if the charge is made that the "Mormon"
</p>
<p>Church is responsible for this crime, then I am
</p>
<p>justified and it is my duty to-night to bring forth
</p>
<p>evidence showing that the "Mormon" Church had
</p>
<p>nothing to do with it.
</p>
<p>On the 7th of February, 1863, John Cradlebaugh,
</p>
<p>of Nevada, who was once one of the associate justices of the Supreme Court of Utah Territory, made
</p>
<p>a speech in Congress, and I will quote from page
</p>
<p>17 of the pamphlet published with the full text of

<p>his speech and references:
</p>
<p>MASSA CRE.
</p>

</p>
<p>"I shall publish a portion as an appendix to
</p>
<p>these remarks that you may see that I am justified
</p>
<p>in charging that the Mormons are guilty, aye, that
</p>
<p>the Mormon Church is guilty, of the crimes of
</p>
<p>murder and robbery as taught in their books of
</p>
<p>faith."
</p>
<p>You see, according to the Hon. John Cradlebaugh, the "Mormon" Church is charged with this
</p>
<p>crime, and charged in the Congress of the United
</p>
<p>States, in a speech published to the country.
</p>
<p>There was a pamphlet prepared in this city
</p>
<p>called "The Handbook of Mormonism"-perhaps
</p>
<p>you have heard of it before, it is a most abominable book-I will make a short quotation from it,
</p>
<p>page 67:
</p>
<p>"It is said to be a truth that Brigham Young
</p>
<p>sent letters south authorizing, if not commanding,
</p>
<p>that the train should be destroyed."
</p>
<p>I will now refer you to a speech made by Mr.
</p>
<p>W. McGrorty in the case of McGrorty versus
</p>
<p>Hooper. You will remember that Mr. McGrorty, in
</p>
<p>1868, contested the seat of Hon. W. H. Hooper, our
</p>
<p>Delegate in Congress, and made an attack upon
</p>
<p>the "Mormons." Ile received 105 votes against
</p>
<p>Mr. Hooper's 15,068. Let me say here that nearly
</p>
<p>all the anti-Mormon stories that have been since
</p>
<p>dished up in various shapes and forms have been
</p>
<p>taken from Mr. McGrorty's speech in Congress;
</p>
<p>from that speech Cradlebaugh made up most of
</p>
<p>his story, and it has been retold over and over
</p>
<p>again from that time to the present. I will read
</p>
<p>from page 40 of the pamphlet containing Mr.
</p>
<p>McGrorty's speech. Mr. McGrorty thought that

<p>the Territory ought at once to be put under martial law, and he said:
</p>
<p>"This may be the only practicable way in which
</p>
<p>even partial punishment can be meted out to these
</p>
<p>latter-day devils. But how inadequate would be
</p>
<p>the punishment of a few even by death for this
</p>
<p>crime which nearly the whole Mormon population
</p>
<p>from Brigham Young down, were more or less instrumental in perpetrating."
</p>
<p>I have a work here which was published by Mr.
</p>
<p>Bishop, who defended John D. Lee at both of his
</p>
<p>trials. I will make a quotation from this book,
</p>
<p>page 19. He says:
</p>
<p>"I claim that Brigham Young is the real criminal and that John D. Lee was an instrument in
</p>
<p>his hands. That Brigham Young used John D.
</p>
<p>Lee as the assassin uses the dagger, to strike down
</p>
<p>his unsuspecting victim; and as the assassin
</p>
<p>throws away the dagger, to avoid its bloody blade
</p>
<p>leading to his detection, so Brigham Young used
</p>
<p>John D. Lee to do his horrid work; and when discovery becomes unavoidable, he hurls Lee from
</p>
<p>him, cuts him away from the Church, and casts
</p>
<p>him far out into the whirlpool of destruction. The
</p>
<p>assassin has no further use for his weapon. I also
</p>
<p>claim that if religious fanaticism can clear a man
</p>
<p>from crime that John D. Lee was guiltless, for he
</p>
<p>was one of the most intensely fanatical Mormons
</p>
<p>that infested Utah in 1857. But I do not claim
</p>
<p>that the fact of his being a fanatic and blinded
</p>
<p>believer of Brigham Young's so-called revelations
</p>
<p>excused him-far from it. In place of excusing
</p>
<p>him it added to his crime. Such insanity as that
</p>
<p>which fanaticism breeds can only, and should only
</p>
<p>be treated by the executioner. And there are many

</p>
<p>disease that calls for the radical treatment that was
</p>
<p>administered to Lee."
</p>
<p>I will read to you now some opinions of the
</p>
<p>press appended to a report of the first Lee trial, in a
</p>
<p>pamphlet emanating from the Tribune office in this
</p>
<p>city. These are clled from different newspapers.
</p>
<p>From the Leavenworth, Kansas, Commercial:
</p>
<p>"The Mormons are making a desperate effort to
</p>
<p>clear Brigham Young of the Mountain Meadow
</p>
<p>massacre, but they will never succeed in convincing the world that the old sinner was not guilty of
</p>
<p>participation in the preliminaries to the inhuman
</p>
<p>outrage, nor that the work of butchery was not
</p>
<p>perpetrated with his sanction, if not by his positive
</p>
<p>command."
</p>
<p>From the Fort Malyne (Indiana) Journal:
</p>
<p>"The evidence in the trial of the Mormon leader,
</p>
<p>John D. Lee, charged with participating in the
</p>
<p>Mountain Meadow massacre in 1857, clearly points
</p>
<p>to the unmistakable guilt of many distinguished
</p>
<p>Mormons, including Brigham Young, Hooper, the
</p>
<p>ex-Congressman, and others."
</p>
<p>From the Leavenworth Times:
</p>
<p>"It would be a waste of time and money to attempt to bring the Mountain Meadows assassins
</p>
<p>to justice. They have too strong a following. The
</p>
<p>Church of the Latter-day Saints is bound to stand
</p>
<p>by them. To convict Lee would be to convict the
</p>
<p>Church and strike a fatal blow at its foundation."
</p>
<p>From the Chicago Inter-Ocean:
</p>
<p>"The investigation, however, has resulted in fixing an indelible stain on the Mormon Church and
</p>
<p>settlilng the responsibility for an act of barbarism

</p>
<p>less savages of the west, who are supposed to know
</p>
<p>no shame nor pity, but who protested against the
</p>
<p>infamy of such a deed."
</p>
<p>From the Idaho (Montana) Statesman:
</p>
<p>"This circumstance is so enormous and crime so
</p>
<p>heinous, and the evidence so plain that it must
</p>
<p>and will be laid at the door of the Church with
</p>
<p>Brigham Young as its leader, and be remembered
</p>
<p>by every mall, woman and child wherever the
</p>
<p>name of Mormon is mentioned."
</p>
<p>From the Hartford (Connecticut) Times.
</p>
<p>"That much at any rate has been shown by Lee's
</p>
<p>trial, and the guilt of mercilessly sacrificing unarmed men, women and children to religious fanaticism are justly chargeable against the Mormon
</p>
<p>Church. It now remains to be seen whether American justice will much longer allow the existence
</p>
<p>of such a blood-thirsty and barbarous organization
</p>
<p>in the country. The good repute of our institutions is at stake in permitting Mormonism a place
</p>
<p>in the land."
</p>
<p>I think it will not be denied now that the charge
</p>
<p>has been made that the "Mormon" Church is responsible for the massacre at Mountain Meadows.
</p>
<p>Now, I claim that the Church is not responsible,
</p>
<p>and to begin my defense of the Church, I will
</p>
<p>read to you from the 42nd section of the Book of
</p>
<p>Doctrine and Covenants. This is a revelation given
</p>
<p>through the Prophet Joseph Smith to the Church,
</p>
<p>February 9th, 1831, to be found on page 170 of the
</p>
<p>Book of Doctrine and Covenants, new edition:
</p>
<p>"And now behold I speak unto the Church.

</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>"And again I say, thou shalt not kill; but lie
</p>
<p>that killeth shall die."
</p>
<p>I will now read to you from page 176, the same
</p>
<p>revelation:
</p>
<p>"And it shall come to pass that if any persons
</p>
<p>among you shall kill, they shall be delivered up
</p>
<p>and dealt with according to the laws of the land;
</p>
<p>for remember that he hath no forgiveness, and it
</p>
<p>shall be proven according to the laws of the
</p>
<p>land."
</p>
<p>That is received by Latter-day Saints in all the
</p>
<p>world as a revelation from God, and as a commandment, a standing commandment to this
</p>
<p>Church-that is, "Thou shalt not kill, and he that
</p>
<p>killeth shall not have forgiveness in this world
</p>
<p>nor in the world to come." In the revelation on
</p>
<p>celestial marriage it is set forth that when persons
</p>
<p>have entered into certain covenants before God of
</p>
<p>a sacred character, and partaken of the Holy Ghost,
</p>
<p>and received the higher ordinances of the Church,
</p>
<p>if they commit murder-shed "innocent blood," it
</p>
<p>will be impossible for them to be forgiven either
</p>
<p>in this world or in the world to come; it will be
</p>
<p>impossible for them to regain their salvation; their
</p>
<p>exaltation is gone. Now, then, that being the doctrine of the Church, how could the Church of
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints authorize the
</p>
<p>wholesale destruction of men, women and children? It could not be. Such an act would be contrary to the doctrines of the Church, contrary to
</p>
<p>the revelations believed by its members to be the
</p>
<p>word of God, believed by the people to be binding

</p>
<p>such crimes they cannot be forgiven either in this

<p>world or in the world to come.
</p>
<p>I will refer you now to a book published by an antiMormon named Beadle-perhaps you have heard
</p>
<p>of Mr. Beadle before. He is the author of a good
</p>
<p>many blood-curdling stories, and some of them are
</p>
<p>told in this book. But I am not going to read
</p>
<p>them to-night, I will merely read to you Beadle's
</p>
<p>testimony in regard to this point. This is the evidence of an enemy:
</p>
<p>"Some months passed away before it was whispered in the northern district that white men were
</p>
<p>concerned in this affair; and to the credit of the
</p>
<p>Mormon people be it said, a great horror spread
</p>
<p>among them at the report.
</p>
<p>"John D. Lee still resides in Harmony (1870) no
</p>
<p>longer a Bishop [he never was a Bishop] and one
</p>
<p>can scarcely restrain a feeling of satisfaction of
</p>
<p>knowing that his life is one of misery. He is
</p>
<p>shunned and hated even by his Mormon neighbors; he seldom ventures beyond the square upon
</p>
<p>which he lives; his mind is distracted by an unceasing dread of vengeance and his intellect is
</p>
<p>disordered." (Beadle's Mysteries of Mormoniszn, page
</p>
<p>185.)
</p>
<p>Now, I ask, how could "a great horror" spread
</p>
<p>among the people if the people were accessories to
</p>
<p>this deed? If it was part of the doctrine of their
</p>
<p>Church, if they were willing and anxious for this
</p>
<p>massacre, how could a great horror spread among
</p>
<p>them at the report of it? And why should Lee be
</p>
<p>shunned by his neighbors if this was a deed that

</p>
<p>MASSA CRE.
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>I will now read to you a few quotations from
</p>
<p>Stenhouse's "Rocky Mountain Saints." This work,
</p>
<p>as you are well aware, was published against the
</p>
<p>"Mormons." Stenhouse was a member of the
</p>
<p>Church and afterwards apostatized and wrote a
</p>
<p>book against the Church. On page 459 he
</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>"The Mormon newspapers very properly declaim
</p>
<p>against "the people" of Utah being branded as
</p>
<p>murderers, because murders have been committed
</p>
<p>within their Territory, and further they protest
</p>
<p>against the great crimes being charged to Brigham
</p>
<p>Young."
</p>
<p>That shows that the "Mormon" people themselves did not approve of that crime, or of any
</p>
<p>other crimes of a similar character.
</p>
<p>I will next read from page 460 of the same
</p>
<p>work:
</p>
<p>"When the news of that deed was heard, the
</p>
<p>people north were terror-stricken, and shuddered
</p>
<p>with horror at the thought of the barbarous crime,
</p>
<p>and the recital of the bloody work is harrowing
</p>
<p>to them to-day.
</p>
<p>"The Mormon people of Utah are not the offspring of a barbarous race, neither were they
</p>
<p>raised and nurtured in uncivilized nations. Apart
</p>
<p>from the spitefulnsss of religious controversywhich, by the by, is nothing peculiar to them-a
</p>
<p>kinder and more simple-hearted people is not upon
</p>
<p>the face of the earth. Had the Mountain Meadow
</p>
<p>massacre occurred in any of the neighboring Territories, and that crime was clearly the work of
</p>
<p>white people, the Mormons would have despised
</p>
<p>them, hated them, and in all probability would have
</p>
<p>refused all intercourse with them."

<p>And on the same page appears the following:
</p>
<p>"That Brigham Young is by his natural instincts a bad man, or that his apostles and his
</p>
<p>bishops are men of blood is not true. Here and
</p>
<p>there among them a malicious man is met with,
</p>
<p>but apart from religion, the ruling men in Utah
</p>
<p>would be considered good citizens in any community."
</p>
<p>That is the testimony of Mr. Stenhouse in a
</p>
<p>book written against the Church.
</p>
<p>I have a little work here published by Jacob
</p>
<p>Hamblin, the man whose ranch was at Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows, but who was not at home when the massacre took place; he was here in Salt Lake City.
</p>
<p>He met the emigrants on his way here as they
</p>
<p>were going south. I will read you from page
</p>
<p>46 of his book:
</p>
<p>"This deplorable affair caused a sensation of
</p>
<p>horror and deep regret throughout the entire community, by whom it was unqalifiedly condemned.
</p>
<p>"In Cove Creek Valley we met others from the
</p>
<p>south, who told us that the Indians were gathering
</p>
<p>to attack another company of emigrants. I procured a horse, left the wagons, and rode on day
</p>
<p>and night. At Cedar City I found Brothers Samuel Knight and Dudley Leavitt.
</p>
<p>"As I was weary with hard riding and want of
</p>
<p>sleep, I hurried them on after the emigrants, while
</p>
<p>I traveled more slowly. I instructed these men to
</p>
<p>make every possible effort to save the company
</p>
<p>and their effects, and to save their lives at all
</p>
<p>hazards.
</p>
<p>"They overtook the company 156 miles from

<p>Indian country. They found a large body of excited Indians preparing to attack and destroy them.
</p>
<p>MASSA CRE.
</p>
<p>"Finding it altogether impossible to control the
</p>
<p>Indians, they compromised the matter. The Indians agreed to only take the loose stock of the
</p>
<p>company, and not meddle with the teams and wagons, and not make any efforts to take their
</p>
<p>lives.
</p>
<p>"The Indians took the loose stock, amounting to
</p>
<p>480 head, on the fifty-mile desert beyond the
</p>
<p>Muddy.
</p>
<p>"The brethren remained with the company, determined to assist in its defense, should the Indians attempt anything more than they had
</p>
<p>agreed."
</p>
<p>This was the company that followed immediately behind the company that was killed, according to Jacob Hamblin.
</p>
<p>I need not tell the Latter-day Saints that the
</p>
<p>deed was condemned. It was a long time before
</p>
<p>any news of this massacre reached the north. It
</p>
<p>should be understood that at that time the southern settlements were few and far between, and the
</p>
<p>country was sparsely settled. The place where the
</p>
<p>massacre took place was 350 miles or thereabouts
</p>
<p>south and west of Salt Lake City. There wereno railroads in the country at that time; there were no
</p>
<p>telegraphs here at that time; and the United States
</p>
<p>mails had been stopped. Uncle Sam had sent out
</p>
<p>an army-or James Buchanan, representing the
</p>
<p>government, had sent it out, in hostility to the
</p>
<p>"Mormons," and the mails were suspended. We

</p>
<p>north, and when it did it was supposed that the
</p>
<p>crime had been perpetrated by the Indians. It
</p>
<p>was known very well that the feeling of the Indians at that time was hostile towards the whites,
</p>
<p>and it was a common expression among them that
</p>
<p>they wanted to fight the "Mericats" as they called
</p>
<p>them. It was thought, therefore, when the word
</p>
<p>came, that the crime had been committed by the
</p>
<p>Indians, and then a feeling of horror pervaded
</p>
<p>the entire community, and it was deplored and
</p>
<p>condemned in toto.
</p>
<p>I have shown in these few references I have
</p>
<p>made that this dreadful crime cannot be laid to
</p>
<p>the door of the people, and it takes the body of
</p>
<p>the "Mormon" people to make the Church. The
</p>
<p>"Mormon" Church is not composed simply of the
</p>
<p>First Presidency. It was not composed at that
</p>
<p>time of Brigham Young and his Counselors.
</p>
<p>They merely formed one quorum in the Church.
</p>
<p>It was not composed of the First Presidency and
</p>
<p>the quorum of the Twelve Apostles. It took the
</p>
<p>whole body of the Church to make the Church.
</p>
<p>We are told in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants that "all things in the Church shall be done
</p>
<p>by common consent," and nothing can be called
</p>
<p>an act of the Church except that which the Church
</p>
<p>votes for or consents to. Even if it could be
</p>
<p>proved that Brigham Young, or George A. Smith,
</p>
<p>or other leading men of the Church were in any
</p>
<p>way compromised in that terrible affair, it would
</p>

<p>The Church is not responsible for the acts of Brig

</p>
<p>ham Young, nor for the acts of any individual.
</p>
<p>Each person is responsible before God for his own
</p>
<p>acts. He is responsible to the Churoh when he
</p>
<p>violates the laws of the Church. Every man in
</p>
<p>the Church, from the highest authority down to
</p>
<p>the lowest, is amenable to the Church courts when
</p>
<p>he falls into transgression; but the transgression
</p>
<p>must be proved and established by the, mouths of
</p>
<p>two or three witnesses according to the Church
</p>
<p>laws, and if a member of the Church transgresses,
</p>
<p>if any man holding the Priesthood transgresses, if
</p>
<p>any man holding any authority whatever transgresses the laws of God and the laws of the Church
</p>
<p>he is amenable to the courts of the Church. Provision is made for the case of every individual,
</p>
<p>from the First Presidency down. If he does anything that is unrighteous he can be judged by the
</p>
<p>Council which is set apart for that purpose. So I
</p>
<p>say that any movement that is made, to be rightly
</p>
<p>chargeable to the Church, must be endorsed by
</p>
<p>the Church as a body, must be done by common
</p>
<p>consent of the Church. The Church of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ of Latter-day Saints never preached the
</p>
<p>doctrine that it was right to kill men, women and
</p>
<p>children, as those emigrants were killed at Mountain Meadows. The Church never endorsed that
</p>
<p>deed, never approved of it. The crime caused a
</p>
<p>thrill of horror to run through the entire community.
</p>
<p>I think I need not dwell any further on the
</p>
<p>accusation in regard to the body of the Church.

</p>
<p>and Apostle George A. Smith, who was afterwards
</p>
<p>the first Counselor of President Young. Brother
</p>
<p>George A. Smith has been charged with going before the emigrants down south and arousing the
</p>
<p>people against them. He has been also charged
</p>
<p>with counseling the people not to sell to this company of emigrants any grain, or flour, or provisions
</p>
<p>of any kind. I-e has been charged with stirring

<p>up a feeling of hostility among the people against

<p>this particular company, and it is claimed that the

<p>effects of his teachings culminated in the massacre.
</p>
<p>I will then first take up the case of George A.
</p>
<p>Smith and see how far he was implicated in this
</p>
<p>matter. I will read to you the affidavit made by

<p>George A. Smith himself, which was presented at

<p>would in all probability end his life.
</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that he never, in the
</p>
<p>year 1857, at Parowan or elsewhere, 'attended a
</p>
<p>council where Wm. H. Dame, Isaac C. Haight or
</p>
<p>others were present to discuss any measures for
</p>
<p>attacking, or in any manner injuring an emigrant
</p>
<p>train from Arkansas or any other place, which is
</p>
<p>alleged to have been destroyed at Mountain Meadows in September, 1857.
</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that lie never heard or
</p>
<p>knew anything of a train of emigrants, which he
</p>
<p>learned afterwards by rumor was from Arkansas,
</p>
<p>until he met said train at Corn Creek on his way
</p>
<p>north to Salt Lake City, on or about the 25th day of
</p>
<p>August, 1857.
</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that he encamped with
</p>
<p>Jacob Hamblin, Philo T. Farnsworth, Silas S.
</p>
<p>Smith and Elijah Hopps, and there for the first
</p>
<p>time he learned of the existence of said emigrant
</p>
<p>train, and their intended journey to California.
</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that having been absent
</p>
<p>from the Territory for a year previous, he returned
</p>
<p>in the Summer of 1857 and went south to visit his
</p>
<p>family at Parowan, and to look after some property

<p>lie had there, and also visit his friends, and for no

<p>other purpose, and that on leaving Salt Lake City
</p>
<p>he had no knowledge whatsoever of the existence
</p>
<p>of said emigrant train, nor did he acquire any until as before stated.

<p>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints he
</p>
<p>preached several times on his way south, and also

</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that he advised the people to furnish all emigrant companies passing
</p>
<p>through the Territory with what they might actually need for breadstuff, for the support of themselves and families while passing through the Territory, and also advised the people not to feed their
</p>
<p>grains to their own stock, nor to sell to the emigrants for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that he never heard or
</p>
<p>knew of any attack upon said emigrant train until some time after his return to Salt Lake City,
</p>
<p>and that while near Fort Bridger he heard for the
</p>
<p>first time that the Indians had massacred an emigrant company at Mountain Meadows.
</p>
<p>Deponent further saith, that he never at any

</p>
<p>that he never knew anything of the distribution

<p>of the property taken there, except by hearsay as

</p>
<p>man of veracity, a man of integrity, well known
</p>
<p>in this community, whose word is as good as his
</p>
<p>bond. I will not read you the whole of the testimony, but just that part pertaining to George A.
</p>
<p>Smith:
</p>
<p>"I lived in Parowan in 1857, came to Utah ten
</p>
<p>years previously. Knew Wm. H. Dame, saw the
</p>
<p>emigrant train at the town above-named; sold
</p>
<p>them flour and salt, had flour to spare and asked
</p>
<p>if they wanted more; they wanted vegetables, but
</p>
<p>witness had none to spare. Saw George A. Smith
</p>
<p>in Parowan Aug. 8th; he came in from the north,
</p>
<p>went down among the settlements, witness accompanying him. A meeting was held in every settlement. Witness attended them all. He (George A.
</p>
<p>Smith) deprecated selling grain and breadstuffs to
</p>
<p>feed to horses and mules. Never heard him, in
</p>
<p>his public addresses, allude to this train."
</p>
<p>I will now read from the testimony of Silas S.
</p>
<p>Smith, a man that is as well known and as highly
</p>
<p>respected as Jesse N. Smith, and was, for many years
</p>
<p>in this community, a member of the Legislative

<p>Assembly:
</p>
<p>"Know George A. Smith; saw him in August
</p>
<p>of 1857 at Parowan and traveled with him through
</p>
<p>the southern settlements, returning with him to
</p>
<p>Cedar Springs, Millard County. George A. Smith,
</p>
<p>in his speeches, referred to the necessity of saving
</p>
<p>grain and not feeding it to horses or stock; he disapproved of selling it for any such use. Heard
</p>
<p>nothing said to discourage the sale of provisions to
</p>
<p>emigrant trains for food. Witness camped at
</p>
<p>Corn Creek and found the Arkansas train in camp
</p>
<p>there on arrival. Some of them came over to

<p>here. Took supper with the emigrants there.
</p>
<p>Four days after this the emigrants passed through
</p>
<p>the town where witness lives, thirty miles south,
</p>
<p>and camped there. Spoke to some of the party;
</p>
<p>saw the leader, heard him called Mr. Fancher.
</p>
<p>Duke's party followed several days after. They
</p>
<p>got into trouble with the Indians near Beaver and
</p>
<p>witness was sent over with ten men by Col. Dame,
</p>
<p>who called at his house to request witness to go to
</p>
<p>the relief of the emigrants. Reached Beaver at
</p>
<p>night, and in the morning found the train corraled and a rifle pit dug for their protection. Sent a
</p>
<p>runner, who brought in the chief, and witness
</p>
<p>placated the wrath of the red men by a liberal distribution of beef. The Indians claimed that some
</p>
<p>of their braves had been shot by men belonging to
</p>
<p>the train, and they must wash out the offense in
</p>
<p>blood. Witness understood that his intervention

<p>had settled the difficulty. Had no further connection with the emigrant trains..-
</p>
<p>"Traveled with George A. Smith from Parowan
</p>
<p>to Santa Clara, 150 miles. Held five or six meetings on the way. George A. Smith invited witness to accompany him. The object of his visit
</p>
<p>was to preach to the people and lay up grain for
</p>
<p>their future support. Col. Johnston's army was

<p>then approaching Utah. Heard nothing said

<p>against allowing emigrant trains to pass through

<p>the country. *
</p>

</p>
<p>George A. Smith did
</p>
<p>not tell witness why he left Salt Lake alone to
</p>
<p>travel through the Territory. His only mission,
</p>
<p>so far as witness knows was to counsel the people
</p>
<p>to save their grain and not feed it to stock."

<p>I;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</p>
<p>MASSACRE..31
</p>
<p>It is well known by those who were residing in
</p>
<p>Utah at that time-I was not here-tflhat this was
</p>
<p>the advice given all over the Territory. The people were counseled not to feed grain to.their stock,
</p>
<p>nor to sell their grain to emigrants for their animals, but ti save it for breadstuff, because of the
</p>
<p>coning of the army. These facts appeared in the
</p>
<p>Journal of Discourscs, which I had the privilege of
</p>
<p>reading in a distant land at that time, and these
</p>
<p>instructions were given to the whole people, not
</p>
<p>only in the south, but in the north, and to the
</p>
<p>whole community. George A. Smith, when traveling to Parowan, preached this to the people in
</p>
<p>every settlement where he stayed, and when lie returned to Salt Lake City he reported in public, in
</p>
<p>the Tabernacle, and his discourse was published in
</p>
<p>the Journal of Discourscs, previously appearing in
</p>
<p>the Deseret XNeas-that lie had counseled the people
</p>
<p>not to waste their grain nor feed it to their own.
</p>
<p>stock, or sell it for that purpose to the emigrants.
</p>
<p>George A. Smith has been charged with going out
</p>
<p>in advance of this company, prejudicing the minds
</p>
<p>of the people against the emigrants and counseling
</p>
<p>the people not to sell them provisions of any kind.
</p>
<p>The affidavit of George A. Smith and the evidence
</p>
<p>of the two Smiths, that I have just read to you,
</p>
<p>show to the contrary. There is no proof whatever,
</p>
<p>no reliable evidence of any description that Geo.
</p>
<p>A. Smith did anything of the kind imputed to
</p>
<p>him. We all know that George A. Smith was not:
</p>
<p>a man of vengeance nor a man of blood. I do not
</p>
<p>think I need spend much more time in regard to

</p>
<p>his case, because, after all, the chief person upon
</p>
<p>whom responsibility for the massacre was desired
</p>
<p>to be saddled was President Brigham Young.
</p>
<p>The question now is whether President Young
</p>
<p>was responsible for that awful crime committed at
</p>
<p>Mountain Meadows. President Young must have
</p>
<p>been an accessory before the fact, or an accessory
</p>
<p>after the fact, if he was in any way chargeable
</p>
<p>with that dreadful deed. I will first examine the
</p>
<p>evidence to see whether he was an accessory before
</p>
<p>the fact; whether he advised this crime; whether
</p>
<p>such of the people who were guilty were influenced
</p>
<p>by any instructions or message he had sent to
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Those of you who are acquainted with the facts
</p>
<p>in relation to the coming of the army from the
</p>
<p>east against the people here, are well aware that it
</p>
<p>vwas a time of great excitement. The army was
</p>
<p>encamped out east, and our brethren were in Echo
</p>
<p>Canyon preparing their defenses. Some of them
</p>
<p>who were out on the plains taking measures to
</p>
<p>arrest the progress of the army, received instructions from President Young. Of what nature
</p>
<p>were they? Everybody acquainted with the facts
</p>
<p>knows that the instructions from President Young
</p>
<p>were, that they might arrest the progress of the
</p>
<p>army, burn the grass, stampede their animals and
</p>
<p>destroy their trains; but they were not to shed a
</p>
<p>drop of blood. These instructions were given over
</p>
<p>and over again to those in charge. I have read
</p>
<p>copies of those despatches in a letter book, signed

<p>by Brigham Young. I have seen these instruc
</p>
<p>MASSA CRE.
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>tions with my own eyes. I have heard the brethren who were engaged in that defense bear testimony to this. The instructions that were given
</p>
<p>over and over again were that they were not to
</p>
<p>shed a drop of blood unless actually compelled
</p>
<p>to do so in self-defense. And, mind you, this was
</p>
<p>at the very time that President Young is said to
</p>
<p>have given instructions to destroy this company of
</p>
<p>emigrants!
</p>
<p>I have to refer you to a good many documents
</p>
<p>and papers, for I do not want you to rely on my
</p>
<p>testimony, but I want to bring forward as clear evidence and proof as I have been able to collect in
</p>
<p>regard to this matter. I want to read to you now
</p>
<p>a statement made by General Daniel H. Wells,
</p>
<p>which was published il the New York IHerald of
</p>
<p>May 6, 1877, being a part of an interview between
</p>
<p>the representative of the NAew York Herald and
</p>
<p>President Young; the former having been sent
</p>
<p>here especially to interview the latter in regard to
</p>
<p>this matter:
</p>
<p>"Everybody remembers how the people behlaved
</p>
<p>when ordered out by President Young to prevent
</p>
<p>Johnston from entering the Territory at what
</p>
<p>might have seemed to another man a most dismal
</p>
<p>moment of his career. The President issued anl
</p>
<p>order which, while it obliged us to burn forage in
</p>
<p>advance, set fire to the grass at night, carry off
</p>
<p>animals and do various other things to hold back
</p>
<p>the enemy, absolutely forbade a single man to shed
</p>
<p>a drop of blood.

<p>of which was the usual inscription, 'Shed no

<p>blood.' That order was taken first to Johnston,
</p>
<p>and was afterwards taken to Washington and
</p>
<p>brought out in the famous debate of the next session."
</p>
<p>You see, this man that was captured had the
</p>
<p>document upon his person giving him instructions,
</p>
<p>and the positive command was that he was to "shed
</p>
<p>no blood."
</p>
<p>I will now read to you an extract from a letter
</p>
<p>published by a company of teamsters who passed
</p>
<p>through this country at the time of the Utah expedition. It was published on the 5th of June,
</p>
<p>1858, in the Southlern Vineyard, a paper printed in
</p>
<p>Los Angeles. It shows the disposition of the people at that time, and the orders of the authorities:
</p>
<p>"On the 16th we arrived.at a Mormon station at
</p>
<p>the mouth of Echo Canyon in a famished condition. On representing our distressed circumstances
</p>
<p>our wants were promptly and gratuitously supplied.
</p>
<p>Here we were furnished with an escort to the city,
</p>
<p>where we met with Lieut. Gen. D. II. Wells, of the
</p>
<p>Utah militia, who issued instructions regarding
</p>
<p>our safety throughout the settlements, accompanied with a relieved escort at each station. We
</p>
<p>recruited ourselves at Beaver City, and it was deemed advisable to fit up for the journey to California.
</p>
<p>We would be exceedingly ungrateful in omitting
</p>
<p>an expression of our sincere thanks and deep indebtedness to our Mormon friends of Utah, and
</p>
<p>the mail carriers, for the disinterested kindness
</p>
<p>evinced towards us in ministering to our wants,
</p>
<p>and for the aid extended to us in our journey to

</p>
<p>This very company of teamsters the "Mormons"
</p>
<p>were accused of murdering, while the facts were
</p>
<p>they owed their lives to "Mormon" generosity.
</p>
<p>Their testimony shows the disposition of the people
</p>
<p>here at that time and the orders of the President

<p>to Gen. D. I-. Wells.
</p>
<p>I will now read to you the instructions of President Young to Col. Dame, at Parowan, which you
</p>
<p>will find in the beautiful (?) book of Mr. Bishop's,
</p>
<p>page 316. I do not think I will take up the time
</p>
<p>in reading the whole of this circular. I will, however, read the latter part of it. It is published in

<p>full in this and other books. It is dated, "Great
</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, September 14, 1857"-just about
</p>
<p>the time of the massacre. I will give you the exact
</p>
<p>date of that occurrence presently. It has been
</p>
<p>disputed as to the actual date when the massacre
</p>
<p>took place, the dates varying from the 10th to the
</p>
<p>16th of September; but I think I can give you the
</p>
<p>exact date:
</p>
<p>"Herewith you will receive the Governor's proclamation declaring martial law.
</p>
<p>"You will probably not be called out this Fall,
</p>
<p>but are requested to continue to make ready for a
</p>
<p>big fight another year."
</p>
<p>At the close of the circular, which was not only
</p>
<p>sent to this gentleman, Col. Dame, but all over the
</p>
<p>Territory, it says:

</p>
<p>Save life always when it is possible. We do not
</p>
<p>wish to shed a drop of blood if it can be avoided."
</p>
<p>Now, here is Brigham Young sending a circular
</p>
<p>to all the chief men of the militia throughout the
</p>
<p>Territory, declaring that he does not want a drop
</p>
<p>of blood shed if it can be avoided. They were to
</p>
<p>save, not destroy, life. And yet we are expected
</p>
<p>to believe that right at that time, or a day or two
</p>
<p>previously, President Young sent down word to
</p>
<p>our brethren in the same neighborhood to kill off
</p>
<p>the emigrants! The story does not hold very well
</p>
<p>together in the light of this circular, from which I
</p>
<p>have just read.
</p>
<p>I will now refer again to Mr. Stenhouse's book,
</p>
<p>"Rocky. Mountain Saints." You must excuse me
</p>
<p>if I take up a good deal of time in reading extracts.
</p>
<p>My object is to establish the facts, as far as possible,
</p>
<p>from the testimony of persons not connected with
</p>
<p>us. I read from Stenhouse's book, page 369:
</p>
<p>"The Prophet had given orders that no blood was
</p>
<p>to be shed under any temptation or provocation,
</p>
<p>save only in the extremity of self-defense."
</p>
<p>That is the testimony of T. B. H. Stenhouse, an
</p>
<p>enemy. I will refer you again to the same book,
</p>
<p>page 385. It is an extract from an address by
</p>
<p>President Young:
</p>
<p>"Should I take a course to waste life? We are
</p>
<p>in duty bound to preserve life-to preserve ourselves on the earth-consequently we must use policy and follow in the counsel given us, in order to
</p>
<p>preserve our lives."
</p>
<p>This address was delivered at the time when
</p>
<p>I the army was coming in. I have read this extract

</p>
<p>to show you that the policy of President Young
</p>
<p>was to preserve life, notwithstanding there was a
</p>
<p>hostile army right on our borders, coming for the
</p>
<p>express purpose of destroying the people, yet the
</p>
<p>policy of President Young was not to shed blood.
</p>
<p>Next, I will read to you an extract from the
</p>
<p>Lee trial-remarks made by Mr. Sumner Howard,
</p>
<p>the U. S. prosecuting attorney at the second trial
</p>
<p>of John D. Lee:
</p>
<p>"He proposed to prove that John D. Lee, without
</p>
<p>any authority from any council or officer, but in
</p>
<p>direct opposition to the feelings and wishes of the
</p>
<p>officers of the Mormon Church, had gone to the
</p>
<p>Mountain Meadows, where the Indians were then
</p>
<p>encamped, accompanied only by a little Indian
</p>
<p>boy, and had assumed command of the Indians,
</p>
<p>whom he had induced, by promises of great booty,
</p>
<p>to attack these emigrants; that in his attack on
</p>
<p>the emigrants he was repulsed; that finding he
</p>
<p>could not get the emigrants out, he sent word to
</p>
<p>the various settlements of southern Utah for men
</p>
<p>to be sent to him, representing that the men were
</p>
<p>needed for various purposes, to some saying the
</p>
<p>Indians had attacked the emigrants and it was
</p>
<p>necessary to have men sent to draw off the Indians,
</p>
<p>to others that men were necessary to protect the
</p>
<p>emigrants, and still others that the emigrants were
</p>
<p>all killed, and that they were required to bury the
</p>
<p>dead; these men went in good faith to perform a
</p>
<p>humane act; that he had arranged with the Indians
</p>
<p>to bring the emigrants out from their corral, or
</p>
<p>fort, by means of a flag of truce; that by this act
</p>
<p>of perfidy he had induced the emigrants to give
</p>
<p>up their arms and place themselves under his protection, loading the arms and the wounded with

</p>
<p>the helpless children into two wagons, which he
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>MO UNTA IV MEAD 0 WS
</p>
<p>had ordered up for the purpose; that he then started the wagons ahead, following them himself, and
</p>
<p>the women following next, the men bringing up
</p>
<p>the rear in single file; that Lee, after having traveled from three quarters of a mile to a mile, gave
</p>
<p>the order to fire, and the slaughter commenced;
</p>
<p>that Lee shot one woman with his rifle, and brained
</p>
<p>another woman; then drawing his pistol, shot
</p>
<p>another, and seizing a man by the collar and drawing him out of a wagon, cut his throat; that he
</p>
<p>gathered up the property of the emigrants and
</p>
<p>took it to his own place, using and selling it for
</p>
<p>his own benefit and use. All these charges against
</p>
<p>John D. Lee, he (District Attorney Howard) proposed to prove to the jury by competent testimony,
</p>
<p>beyond reasonable doubt, or beyond any doubt,
</p>
<p>and thought no appeal to the jury would be required to induce them to give a verdict in accordance with the evidence."
</p>
<p>I will now read to you a passage from Lee's confession, or reported confession. John D. Lee made
</p>
<p>a great many so-called "confessions" which are
</p>
<p>rather contradictory. This confession is supposed
</p>
<p>to be the "only true and genuine one." Whether
</p>
<p>it is or not I cannot say. My opinion is from what
</p>
<p>I have read that John D. Lee furnished particulars
</p>
<p>and data to Mr. Bishop, who worked them up with
</p>
<p>some of his own notions and fabrications into this
</p>
<p>book. I cite this work of an enemy to show
</p>
<p>that President Young was not an accessory
</p>
<p>before the fact. I read from Bishop's book, page
</p>
<p>233:
</p>
<p>"Major Higbee said 'Here are the orders' and

<p>handed me a paper from Haight. It was in sub
</p>
<p>MASSA CRE.
</p>
<p>stance that it was the orders of Haight to decoy
</p>
<p>the emigrants from their position and kill all of
</p>
<p>them that could talk. This order was in writing.
</p>
<p>Higbee handed it me and I read it, and then dropped it on the ground, saying 'I cannot do this.'
</p>
<p>The substance of the orders were that the emigrants should be decoyed from their stronghold
</p>
<p>and all exterminated so that no one would be left
</p>
<p>to tell the tale and then the authorities could say
</p>
<p>it was done by the Indians."
</p>
<p>You see this order did not come from Brigham
</p>
<p>Young. If it was given at all it come from
</p>
<p>Haight. We will now turn to page 245 of the
</p>
<p>same work:
</p>
<p>"After the dead were searched the brethren were
</p>
<p>called up and Higbee and Klingensmith, as well
</p>
<p>as myself made speeches, and ordered the people to
</p>
<p>keep the matter a secret from the entire world. Not
</p>
<p>to tell their wives, or their most intimate friends,
</p>
<p>and we pledged ourselves to keep everything relating to the affair a secret through life. We also
</p>
<p>took the most binding oaths to stand by each
</p>
<p>other, and to always insist that the massacre was
</p>
<p>committed by Indians alone. *
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p>"Knowing that Dame and Haight had quarrelled at Hamblin's that morning, I wanted to
</p>
<p>know how they would act in sight of the dead, who
</p>
<p>lay there as the result of their orders. I was
</p>
<p>greatly interested to know what Dame had to say,
</p>
<p>so I kept close to them, without appearing to be
</p>
<p>watching them. Col. Dame was silent for some
</p>
<p>time. He looked all over the field and was quitepale
</p>
<p>and looked uneasy and frightened. I thought then
</p>
<p>that he was just finding out the difference between
</p>
<p>giving and executing orders for wholesale killing.
</p>
<p>He spoke to Haight and said:

<p>"'I must report this matter to the authorities.'
</p>
<p>"'How will you report it?' said Iaight.
</p>
<p>"Dame said, 'I will report it just as it is.'
</p>
<p>"'Yes, I suppose so, and implicate yourself with
</p>
<p>the rest,' said Haight.
</p>
<p>"'No,' said Dame, 'I will not implicate myself, for
</p>
<p>I had nothing to do with it.'
</p>
<p>"Haight then said, 'That will not do, for you

</p>
<p>and would have gone away, but he knew Haight
</p>
<p>was a man of determination and would not stand
</p>
<p>any foolishness."
</p>
<p>You see that there was a quarrel, according to
</p>
<p>John D. Lee, between Haight and Dame in regard
</p>
<p>to this matter right on the field near where the
</p>
<p>dead were lying. Dame disclaimed.having anything whatever to do with the crime; but Haight,
</p>
<p>as I have read to you, tried to place the responsibility upon him. Dame declared he had had
</p>
<p>nothing to do with it, that he had given no orders
</p>
<p>concerning it, and threatened to report the details
</p>
<p>to the authorities of the Church. Haight immediately was afraid, and asked him what he was
</p>
<p>going to report. Now, then, if Brigham Young
</p>
<p>had given orders to have the emigrants massacred,
</p>
<p>why should Haight be in such a state of alarm at
</p>
<p>the declaration of Dame that he was going to
</p>
<p>report the matter toPresident Young? We are
</p>
<p>asked to believe that President Young ordered

</p>
<p>that massacre. Yet here we learn by the confession of John D. Lee, who states that he heard this
</p>
<p>MASSACRE.
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>quarrel between Haight and Dame, that Haight,
</p>
<p>who had given the order, wanted to lay the blame
</p>
<p>upon Dame, and that Haight was afraid to have
</p>
<p>the massacre reported to the authorities of the
</p>
<p>Church. Here is an account of some speeches
</p>
<p>made just after this; page 347:
</p>
<p>"The speeches were first-thanks to God for
</p>
<p>delivering our enemies into our hands; next,
</p>
<p>thanking the brethren for their zeal in God's
</p>
<p>cause; and then the necessity of always saying the
</p>
<p>Indians did it alone, and that the Mormons had
</p>
<p>nothing to do with it. The speeches, however,
</p>
<p>were in the shape of exhortation and commands
</p>
<p>to keep the whole matter secret from everyone but
</p>
<p>Brigham Young. It was voted unanimously that
</p>
<p>any man who should divulge the secret, or tell who
</p>
<p>was present, or do anything that would lead to a
</p>
<p>discovery of the truth, should suffer death.
</p>
<p>"The brethren then all took a most solemn oath,
</p>
<p>binding themselves under the most dreadful and awful penalties, to keep the whole matter secret from
</p>
<p>every human being, as long as they should live.
</p>
<p>No man was to know the facts. The brethren were
</p>
<p>sworn not to talk of it among themselves, and each
</p>
<p>one swore to help kill all who proved to be traitors
</p>
<p>to the Church or people in this matter.
</p>
<p>"It was then agreed that Brigham Young should
</p>
<p>be informed of the whole matter, by some one to
</p>
<p>be selected by the Church council, after the brethren had returned home."
</p>
<p>Now, you see, there was an agreement that this
</p>
<p>matter should be reported to President Young, and
</p>
<p>yet we are asked to believe that President Young
</p>
<p>had ordered it. Dame and Haight quarreled over
</p>
<p>it. Haight feared that it would be reported just as

</p>
<p>it was, and the whole body'of men were sworn to
</p>
<p>keep it entirely secret. John D. Lee was selected
</p>
<p>to go to President Young and make a report. -We
</p>
<p>will find out presently what kind of a report Lee
</p>
<p>made. John D. Lee says, page 250:
</p>
<p>"The first time I heard that a messenger had
</p>
<p>been sent to Brigham Young for instructions as to
</p>
<p>what should be done with the emigrants, was three
</p>
<p>or four days after I had returned home from the
</p>
<p>Meadows. Then I heard of it from Isaac C.
</p>
<p>Haight, when he came to my house and had a talk
</p>
<p>with me. He said:
</p>
<p>"'We are in a muddle. Haslamn has returned
</p>
<p>from Salt Lake City, with orders from Brigham
</p>
<p>Young to let the emigrants pass in safety.'
</p>
<p>"In this conversation Haight also said:
</p>
<p>"'I sent an order to Higbee to save the emigrants, after I had sent the orders for killing them
</p>
<p>all, but for some reason the message did not reach
</p>
<p>him. I understand that the messengers did not
</p>
<p>go to the Meadows at all.'
</p>
<p>"I at once saw that we were in a bad fix, and I
</p>
<p>asked Iaight what was to be done. We talked the
</p>
<p>matter over again.
</p>
<p>"Haight then told me. that it was the orders of
</p>
<p>the council that I should go to Salt Lake City and
</p>
<p>lay the whole matter before Brigham Young. I
</p>
<p>asked him if he was not going to write a report of
</p>
<p>it to the governor, as he was the right man to do
</p>
<p>it, for he was in command of the militia in that
</p>
<p>section of the country, and next to Dame in command of the whole district. I told him that it was
</p>
<p>a matter which really belonged to the military department, and should be so reported.
</p>
<p>"He refused to write a report, saying:

</p>

</p>
<p>You are like a member of Brigham's family, and
</p>
<p>can talk to him privately and confidentially. I
</p>
<p>want you to take all of it on yourself that you can,
</p>
<p>and not expose any more of the brethren than you
</p>
<p>find absolutely necessary."
</p>
<p>Now, here are the instructions of Haight to
</p>
<p>John I). Lee. Here is Haight trying to cover up
</p>
<p>from President Young the crime which we are
</p>
<p>asked to believe President Young had ordered.
</p>
<p>The message had come saying that the emigrants
</p>
<p>were to be allowed to pass. But Haight wanted
</p>
<p>John D. Lee to go to Salt Lake City and fix it up;
</p>
<p>make a report to the President so as to allay his
</p>
<p>feelings. John D. Lee subsequently agreed to do
</p>
<p>this.
</p>
<p>Now I will cite to you the testimony of Laban
</p>
<p>Morrill in regard to the dispatch from President
</p>
<p>Young to Haight. I will refer again to Bishop's
</p>
<p>book, page 320. An objection was made on the
</p>
<p>part of the defense at the second Lee trial to the
</p>
<p>introduction of this testimony, but the objection
</p>
<p>was averruled:
</p>
<p>"As I said, there appeared to be some confusion
</p>
<p>in that council. I inquired in a friendly way, what
</p>
<p>was up. I was told that there was an emigrant
</p>
<p>train that passed along down to near Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows, and that they had made threats in
</p>
<p>regard to us as a people-said they would destroy
</p>
<p>every d d Mormon. There was an army coming on the north and south, and it created some
</p>
<p>little excitement. I made two or three replies in
</p>
<p>a kind of debate of measures that were taken into

</p>
<p>we thought best to take in regard to protecting the
</p>
<p>lives of the citizens.
</p>
<p>"My objections were not coincided with. At last
</p>
<p>we touched upon the topic like this: \e should
</p>
<p>still keep quiet, and a dispatch should be sent to
</p>
<p>Governor Young to know what would be the best
</p>
<p>course. The vote was unanimous. I considered
</p>
<p>it so. It seemed to be the understanding that on
</p>
<p>the coming morning or next day there should be
</p>
<p>a messenger dispatched. I took some pains to inquire and know if it would be sent in the morning. The papers were said to be made out, and
</p>
<p>Governor Young should be informed, and no
</p>
<p>hostile course pursued till his return. I returned
</p>
<p>back to Fort Johnson, feeling that all was well.
</p>
<p>About eight and forty hours before the messenger returned, business called me to Cedar City,
</p>
<p>and I learned that the job had been done, that is the
</p>
<p>destruction of the emigrants had taken place. I can't
</p>
<p>give any further evidence on the subject at present.
</p>
<p>"What was the name of the messenger sent to
</p>
<p>Salt Lake?
</p>
<p>"James Haslam."
</p>
<p>I will now read to you the testimony of James
</p>
<p>Haslam:
</p>
<p>"James Haslam, of Wellsville, Cache Valley,
</p>
<p>was sworn. He lived in Cedar City in 1857; was
</p>
<p>ordered by Haight to take a message to President
</p>
<p>Young with all speed; knew the contents of the
</p>
<p>message; left Cedar City on Monday, September 7,
</p>
<p>1857, between 5 and 6 p. m., and arrived at Salt
</p>
<p>Lake on Thursday at 11 a. m.; started back at 3
</p>
<p>p. m., and reached Cedar about 11 a. m. Sunday morning, September 13th; delivered the, answer from President Young to Haight, who said

</p>
<p>it was too late. Witness testified that when leav-
</p>
<p>NA SSA CR E.
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>ing Salt Lake to return, President Young said to
</p>
<p>him: "Go with all speed, spare no horseflesh. The
</p>
<p>emigrants must not be meddled with, if it takes
</p>
<p>all Iron County to prevent it. They must go free
</p>
<p>and unmolested.' Witness knew the contents of
</p>
<p>the answer. He got back with the message the
</p>
<p>Sunday after the massacre and reported to Haight,
</p>
<p>who said, 'It is too late."'
</p>
<p>-.
</p>
<p>That is the testimony of James Haslam at the \
</p>
<p>second Lee trial. According to what I have shown
</p>
<p>you President Young could not have been an accessory before the fact. He knew nothing about
</p>
<p>this matter until the dispatch came from Haight.
</p>
<p>As soon as he received that dispatch he sent back
</p>
<p>word-and told the messenger to spare no horseflesh in returning-that the emigrants must not
</p>
<p>be meddled with, and that if it took all Iron
</p>
<p>County to prevent them being interrupted by the
</p>
<p>Indians, it must be used for their protection. That
</p>
<p>is the testimony of James Haslam.
</p>
<p>We have been tantalized a great deal in regard
</p>
<p>to the dispatch or letter sent by President Young
</p>
<p>by this messenger Haslam. As I had never seen
</p>
<p>it published I supposed that it could not be found.
</p>
<p>I had learned from President Young's testimony
</p>
<p>that the letter sent to him from Ilaight by Haslam
</p>

<p>dispatch in reply to Haight at that time, and since

<p>President Young usually kept a copy of his

<p>that Brigham Young sent by James Haslam.
</p>
<p>James Haslam testified that he delivered the dispatch to Haight, but Haight said it was too late.
</p>
<p>But it is objected, "Why don't you produce the

<p>matter up, and succeeded in getting the letter-book

<p>in which the correspondence of President Young at
</p>
<p>that period was copied, and found this identical

</p>
<p>Elder Isaac C. Haight:
</p>
<p>DEAn BROTHER:-Your note of the 7th inst. is
</p>
<p>to hand. Capt. Van Vliet, Acting Commissary, is
</p>
<p>here, having come in advance of the army to procure necessaries for them. We do not expect that
</p>
<p>any part of the army will be able to reach here
</p>
<p>this fall. There is only about 850 men coming. They
</p>
<p>are now at or near Laramie. A few of their freight
</p>
<p>trains are this side of that place, the advance of.
</p>
<p>which are now on Green River. They will not be
</p>
<p>able to come much if any further on account of
</p>
<p>their poor stock. They cannot get here this season without we help them. So you see that the
</p>
<p>Lord has answered our prayers, and again averted
</p>
<p>the blow designed for our heads. In regard to the
</p>
<p>emigration trains passing through our settlements,
</p>
<p>we must not interfere with them until they are first: notified to keep away. You must not me.ddle with
</p>
<p>them. The Indians we expect will do as they please,: but you should try and preserve good feelings with
</p>
<p>them. There are no other trains going south that I

<p>County of Salt Lake. ss.
</p>
<p>I, Nephi W. Clayton, a notary public, within and
</p>
<p>for the County of Salt Lake, Territory of Utah,
</p>
<p>hereby certify that the foregoing is a full, true and
</p>
<p>correct copy of an impression of the foregoing
</p>
<p>letter; as witness my hand and official seal, at my
</p>
<p>office in Salt Lake City, Utah, this 18th day of

</p>
<p>That is a full and verbatim copy of the letter
</p>
<p>sent by President Young in the hands of James
</p>
<p>Haslam to Isaac C. Haight, which arrived, as has
</p>
<p>been testified, forty-eight hours after the massacre.
</p>
<p>He reached Cedar City on Sunday the 13th. The
</p>
<p>massacre then took place on September 11th, the
</p>
<p>day after this letter was written. Isaac C. Haight
</p>
<p>said, "It is too late." He had sent for instructions,
</p>
<p>according to the agreement in council, but had
</p>
<p>been prevailed upon by John D. Lee to hurry the.thing up and not wait for a reply. John D. Lee
</p>
<p>said he never heard of this letter until after he

</p>
<p>returned from the Meadows. But it is clear that a
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>MO UNTA IN fMEA D O WS
</p>
<p>letter was sent. It is evident that Haight had
</p>
<p>written to President Young to find out how near
</p>
<p>the army was, and what prospects there were of its
</p>
<p>coming here. He had undoubtedly referred to
</p>
<p>this emigrant train, and he informed the President of the antagonism that prevailed against the
</p>
<p>emigrants on the part of the Indians, and, in the
</p>
<p>answer, President Young emphatically declared
</p>
<p>that the emigrants must not be meddled with. This
</p>
<p>is strictly in accordance with the instructions that
</p>
<p>I have shown you this evening were given by President Young during the whole of that period, that
</p>
<p>exciting time when the army was coming, namely,
</p>
<p>to "shed no blood." That was the counsel of the
</p>
<p>President, and that is corroborated by this
</p>
<p>-f dispatch.
</p>
<p>I do not think I need to spend any more time in
</p>
<p>proving that President Young was not an accessory before the fact. I believe it will be conceded
</p>
<p>by everybody that understands these facts, that
</p>
<p>Brigham Young did not order the massacre; that
</p>
<p>he was not implicated in it at all; that he did all
</p>
<p>in his power to have these emigrants go through
</p>
<p>free and in peace. I think this evidence is complete. It is to me; and I have looked into this
</p>
<p>matter very closely for my own information, and
</p>
<p>that I might lay it before my friends.
</p>
<p>Now, as to President Young being an accessory
</p>
<p>after the fact. It is claimed that Lee came to
</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, as directed by Haight, about the

<p>latter part of September, to make a full and complete report of the massacre to President Young;
</p>
<p>AlA SSA ClR E.
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>to tell who was there; and to give the names of
</p>
<p>the white men who were engaged in the tragedy.
</p>
<p>The question arises, is that true? Is it a fact that
</p>
<p>President Young was informed that John D. Lee
</p>
<p>and other white men were engaged in that awful
</p>
<p>massacre? I hope you will be patient while I go
</p>
<p>into that part of the subject and make this thing
</p>
<p>complete; for it is an important matter, we ought
</p>
<p>to understand it, and the name of President Young
</p>
<p>ought to be cleared from this stigma, if the story
</p>
<p>is untrue. If it is true the responsibility should
</p>
<p>be placed upon him, it doesn't belong to the "Mormon" Church. If Brigham Young was guilty of
</p>
<p>any complicity in this crime we want to know it,
</p>
<p>and I do not shrink the investigation of anything.
</p>
<p>If there is anything about this Church that cannot be investigated I want to know it. But everything I know about "Mormonism" will bear the light
</p>
<p>of day. Everything I know of "Mormonism" will
</p>
<p>bear investigation in the light of eternal truth, and
</p>
<p>so with its relation to the subject before us to-night.
</p>
<p>I know it, for I have looked at it in its bearings,
</p>
<p>in all its details, and I am not afraid to investigate
</p>
<p>anything pertaining to it. If there is anything
</p>
<p>that will not stand investigation it is not worthy
</p>
<p>of credence, not fit to be a part of our faith and
</p>
<p>practice. Then let us examine this matter and
</p>
<p>see if President Young was an accessory after the
</p>
<p>fact. I will read from Bishop's book, page 252.
</p>
<p>Here is John D. Lee's statement:
</p>
<p>"According to the orders of Isaac C. Haight, I

</p>
<p>connected with the massacre to Brigham Young.
</p>
<p>I started about a week or ten days after the massacre, and I was on the way about ten days."
</p>
<p>Now remember the massacre took place, according to the testimony, on the 11th day of September, 1857, for this reason: Haslam reached Cedar
</p>
<p>City on the Sunday, forty-eight hours after the
</p>
<p>massacre. Everyone wlo has testified about it
</p>
<p>agrees that it took place on a Friday. Thie Friday
</p>
<p>before the 13th was the 11th. John D. Lee started
</p>
<p>for Salt Lake City about a week or ten days after
</p>
<p>the massacre and was about ten days on the road.
</p>
<p>That would bring him here about the end of September. I will read Lee's statement again:
</p>
<p>"According to the orders of Isaac C. Haight, I
</p>
<p>started for Salt Lake City to report the whole facts
</p>
<p>connected with the massacre to Brigham Young.
</p>
<p>I started about a week or ten days after the massacre, and I was on the way about ten days. When
</p>
<p>I arrived in the city I went to the President's
</p>
<p>house and gave to Brigham Young a full, detailed
</p>
<p>statement of the whole affair, from first to lastonly I took rather more on myself than I had
</p>
<p>done.
</p>
<p>"He asked me if I had brought a letter from
</p>
<p>Haight, with his report of the affair. I said:
</p>
<p>"'No, Haight wished me to make a verbal report
</p>
<p>of it, as I was an eye-witness to much of it.'
</p>
<p>"I then went over the whole affair and gave him
</p>
<p>as full a statement as it was possible for me to
</p>
<p>ive. I described everything about it. I told
</p>
<p>im of the orders Haight first gave me. I told

<p>him everything."

<p>51
</p>
<p>am not prepared to state; but it is published here,
</p>
<p>and we have to take it for what it is worth. We
</p>
<p>have seen a good many conflicting "confessions of
</p>
<p>John D. Lee," and that is one of them. Suppose
</p>
<p>it is true-although there is a doubt in my mind
</p>
<p>-that he claimed to have told President Young
</p>
<p>everything. This is the testimony of a being who
</p>
<p>is said to have brained a woman, who, it is proved,
</p>
<p>cut a man's throat, shot wounded emigrants, whom
</p>
<p>he had decoyed out of their camp with a flag of
</p>
<p>truce. That is his testimony. Now, let us take
</p>
<p>the testimony of a man whose evidence is worthy
</p>
<p>of credence. I have two or three documents here.
</p>
<p>I will read you a statement made to me by President Wilford Woodruff, to which I got him to
</p>
<p>certify. Brother Woodruff is an honest, upright,
</p>
<p>truthful man, whose word can be relied upon implicitly. Is he not? I am sure everybody who
</p>
<p>knows him will answer "Yes." Here is his statemlent:

</p>
<p>States and a resident of Utal Territory, over the
</p>
<p>age of twenty-one years. In the Fall of 1857 I was
</p>
<p>in the office of Governor Brigham Young, in Salt

<p>Lake City, when John D. Lee, who had just arrived
</p>
<p>from the south, and was dusty and tired, came to
</p>
<p>the front office and asked for a private interview

<p>with Governor Young. He was invited by the
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>MO UNTAIN MEAD 0 WS
</p>
<p>Governor to the back office; I was requested to
</p>
<p>accompany him. We all went into the back office.
</p>
<p>There John D. Lee made a statement concerning
</p>
<p>the massacre of emigrants that had then recently
</p>
<p>taken place at Mountain Meadows. He stated that
</p>
<p>the emigrants had aroused the hostility of the Indians by poisoning several springs from which the
</p>
<p>Indians obtained water for drinking purposes;
</p>
<p>that they had poisoned cattle which had died, by
</p>
<p>putting poison into the carcasses, and that some of
</p>
<p>the Indians, who lad eaten of the meat, died from
</p>
<p>its effects; that in consequence of this and their
</p>
<p>vile acts, the ire of the Indians was aroused, that
</p>
<p>he could not restrain them. He held them back
</p>
<p>as long as he could, until the emigrants arrived at
</p>
<p>the Mountain Meadows, when he could hold them
</p>
<p>back no longer, and they attacked these emigrants
</p>
<p>and killed them all except some small children. Governor Young was profoundly affected. He shed
</p>
<p>tears and said he was sorry that innocent blood
</p>
<p>had been shed within the limits of this Territory.
</p>
<p>John D. Lee remarked, "There was not a drop of
</p>
<p>innocent blood in the camp." Governor Young
</p>
<p>asked indignantly, "What do you call the blood
</p>
<p>of women and children?" Lee was silent. Lee
</p>
<p>did not intimate by a single word that any white
</p>
<p>man had anything whatever to do with the massacre. He laid the whole thing to the Indians,
</p>
<p>and claimed that he had done his best to prevent
</p>
<p>the occurrence. In the Fall of 1870 I was with
</p>
<p>President Brigham Young on a tour of the southern
</p>
<p>settlements. Erastus Snow who was then in charge
</p>
<p>of those settlements, informed President Young,
</p>
<p>as I then learned, that there were evidences of
</p>
<p>a strong character showing that John D.;
</p>
<p>Lee was personally implicated in the Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows massacre. President Young was very
</p>
<p>much surprised, and declared that if it was true,

</p>
<p>John D. Lee had lied to him. When the President
</p>
<p>and company returned to Salt Lake City, he called
</p>
<p>a council of the President and the Twelve Apostles,
</p>
<p>when the matter was investigated, Elder Erastus
</p>
<p>Snow assisting in presenting the evidence; and the
</p>
<p>council unanimously voted to excommunicate
</p>
<p>John D. Lee for assisting in the murders at Mountain Meadows, and Isaac C. Haight, who was
</p>
<p>then President of the Stake in which Lee resided,
</p>
<p>for not restraining and preventing his participation in the crime. It was not until this occurrence
</p>
<p>last related, that President Young and his immediate associates fully realized the facts of Lee's
</p>
<p>guilt. Some had heard rumors of this, but the
</p>
<p>facts had not been brought to the knowledge

<p>of the President.

</p>
<p>TERRITORY OF UTAH, T

<p>County of Salt Lake. ss.
</p>
<p>Personally appeared before me undersigned, a
</p>
<p>notary public in and for said county, Charles W.
</p>
<p>Penrose, who on his oath deposes and says: I am
</p>
<p>a citizen of the United States over the age of
</p>
<p>twenty-one years, and a resident of Salt Lake
</p>
<p>County. I have obtained from Wilford Woodruff
</p>
<p>of this city, a volume containing his journal from
</p>
<p>January 1, 1854, to December, 1859, in his own
</p>
<p>handwriting, with which I am acquainted. Under
</p>
<p>date of September 29, 1857, I find the following:
</p>
<p>"We have another express in this morning, saying that the army are rapidly marching toward us,
</p>
<p>will soon be at Bridger, and wish men immediately
</p>
<p>sent out. John D. Lee also arrived from Harmony
</p>
<p>with an express and an awful tale of blood. A
</p>
<p>company of California emigrants, of about 150
</p>
<p>men, women and children. Many of them belonged to the mobbers of Missouri and Illinois.
</p>
<p>They had many cattle and horses with them, and
</p>
<p>they traveled along south. They went damning
</p>
<p>Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and the heads
</p>
<p>of the Church; saying that Joseph Smith ought to
</p>
<p>have been shot a long time before he was. They
</p>
<p>wanted to do all the evil they could, so they poisoned beef and gave it to the Indians, and some of
</p>
<p>them died; they poisoned the springs of water,
</p>
<p>and several of the Saints died. The Indianls became enraged at their conduct and they surrounded them on the prairie, and the emigrants
</p>
<p>formed a bulwark of their wagons, and dug an

<p>entrenchment up to the hubs of their wagons, but
</p>
<p>-MA SSA CRE.
</p>
<p>the Indians fought them five days until they had
</p>
<p>killed all the men, about sixty in number. They
</p>
<p>then rushed into the corral and cut the throats of
</p>
<p>the women and children, except some eight or ten
</p>
<p>children which they brought and sold to the
</p>
<p>whites. They stripped the men and women naked
</p>
<p>and left them stinking in the sun. When Brother
</p>
<p>Lee found it out he took some men and went and
</p>
<p>buried their bodies. It was a horrid, awful job.
</p>
<p>The whole air was filled witli an awful stench. The
</p>
<p>Indians obtained all the cattle and horses and property, guns, etc. There was another large company of
</p>
<p>emigrants who had 1,000 head of cattle, who was also
</p>
<p>damning both the Indians and the 'Mormons.' They
</p>
<p>were afraid of slaring the same fate. Brother Lee
</p>
<p>had to send interpreters with them to the Indians
</p>
<p>to help save their lives, while at the same
</p>
<p>time they were trying to kill us. I spent most of
</p>
<p>the day in trying to get the brethren ready to go
</p>
<p>to the Mountains. Brother Brigham, while Lee
</p>
<p>was speaking of the cutting of the throats of women and children by the Indians down south, said
</p>
<p>it was heart-rending; that emigration must stop,
</p>
<p>as he had said before. Brother Lee said he did
</p>
<p>not think there was a drop of innocent blood in
</p>
<p>the camp, for he had two of the children in his
</p>
<p>house, and he could not get but one to kneel down
</p>
<p>in prayer-time, and the other would laugh at her
</p>
<p>for doing it, and they would swear like pirates."

<p>I have read that extract from Brother Woodruff's journal because it completely corroborates
</p>
<p>what he so clearly gave me from memory. I will
</p>
<p>now read you the affidavit of Brother John W.
</p>
<p>Young:
</p>
<p>TERRITORY OF UTAH, 1
</p>
<p>County of Salt Lake. J ss
</p>
<p>Personally appeared before me, the undersigned,
</p>
<p>a notary public, in and for said county, John W.
</p>
<p>Young who, on his oath, deposes and says: I am
</p>
<p>a citizen of the United States, over the age of
</p>
<p>twenty-one years. In the Fall of the year 1857, I
</p>
<p>being then 13 years of age, was engaged at the
</p>
<p>office of my father, Governor Brigham Young, as
</p>
<p>messenger. I distinctly remember one day in the
</p>
<p>latter part of September 1857, being at my father's
</p>
<p>office when John D. Lee, travel-worn, as if he had
</p>
<p>come in haste from a long journey, entered the
</p>
<p>office and asked for a private interview with Gov.
</p>
<p>Young. IIe was shown into the back office, Elder
</p>
<p>Wilford Woodruff going in with him. I followed
</p>
<p>them and heard the conversation. It was customary for me to be present during those exciting
</p>
<p>times when messengers arrived, so as to be ready
</p>
<p>to carry any message that might have to be sent.
</p>
<p>I do not remember that anyone else was present.
</p>
<p>It is distinctly impressed on my mind beyond
</p>
<p>the power of time to efface, how Lee described the
</p>
<p>deed which he said was committed by the Indians
</p>
<p>at Mountain Meadows. He told of the depredations committed by the company of emigrants destroyed; how they poisoned meat and gave it to
</p>
<p>the Indians, and also poisoned springs in their

</p>
<p>were so enraged against the emigrants that it was
</p>
<p>impossible to prevent their attack. He related
</p>
<p>how the Indians killed the men and then butchered the women, none being saved except a number of little children, which he, Lee, was instrumental in rescuing. Also that he took men to
</p>
<p>help to bury the dead. Gov. Young was greatly
</p>
<p>moved. I saw him wipe away the tears as he
</p>
<p>listened to the recital. He expressed his horror at
</p>
<p>the deed, and the shedding of innocent blood in
</p>
<p>this Territory. Lee declared that no innocent
</p>
<p>blood was shed, for the emigrants were a corrupt
</p>
<p>and murderous set. Gov. Young referred to the
</p>
<p>women and children who were slain, and declared
</p>
<p>that it was an awful crime. I was present during
</p>
<p>the whole interview, and know that Lee laid the
</p>
<p>matter entirely to the Indians, claiming that they
</p>
<p>alone killed the emigrants, against his earnest
</p>
<p>efforts to prevent it; that he was on the spot only
</p>
<p>to restrain the Indians and save life, and afterwards to bury the dead. He did not utter a syllable or convey any idea that either he or any
</p>
<p>other white person had any hand in the deed. The
</p>
<p>interview on that September morning impressed my
</p>
<p>boyish mind very strongly. Lee's recital was so forcible regarding the crime being committed by the
</p>
<p>Indians, and his sorrow and tears at the occurrence, appeared so sincere, that, years after, when
</p>
<p>it was rumored that white men were engaged in
</p>
<p>the massacre, I could not, and did not, believe it.
</p>
<p>It was only when proofs were brought which led
</p>
<p>to John D. Lee's excommunication from the
</p>
<p>Church, that I believed in his guilt. I was present
</p>
<p>on several occasions at the office of Gov. Young
</p>
<p>during the time of the approach of the army and
</p>
<p>heard Gov. Young warn those who had anything
</p>
<p>to do with the troops sent to intercept the army,

</p>
<p>times repeated. I have been present when Indian
</p>
<p>chiefs came to Governor Young and asked to go
</p>
<p>out against the army. Gov. Young would not
</p>
<p>consent to the shedding of one drop of blood. I
</p>
<p>also distinctly remember a meeting after the coming in of the army, and after the return from the
</p>
<p>move south, at which Gov. Cumming and one or
</p>
<p>two of the United States judges appointed with
</p>
<p>him were present, when the report that white men
</p>
<p>had been engaged in the massacre at Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows was referred to, and President Young
</p>
<p>offered to go with the governor and one of the
</p>
<p>judges-Cradlebaugh, I believe, and help to fully
</p>
<p>investigate the matter, and also to remain as a
</p>
<p>hostage in the hands of the federal authorities, if
</p>
<p>necessary, until the investigation was made complete, so strong was his confidence in the statement that none but Indians were engaged in the
</p>
<p>massacre.

<p>with Judge Aaron Farr, who used to reside in Salt

</p>
<p>word a few days ago to Judge Farr that I would
</p>
<p>like his statement in writing, and here it is:
</p>
<p>"I was personally acquainted with John D. Lee,
</p>
<p>having known him when a boy in Nauvoo. In the
</p>
<p>Fall of 1857, he came to Salt Lake City from his
</p>
<p>home in Iron County, shortly after the massacre,
</p>
<p>to report to Brigham Young how it occurred. On
</p>
<p>the same day that he reported to President Young
</p>
<p>in the morning, he came to my residence on West
</p>
<p>Temple Street, opposite Bishop Hunter's place, in
</p>
<p>the afternoon, and in a conversation with me, lasting about an hour and a half, detailed every particular of the horrible occurrence. He placed the
</p>
<p>whole blame of the massacre on the Indians. He
</p>
<p>stated that he and his associates had done all in
</p>
<p>their power to protect the emigrants, but were totally helpless in their object. He seemed very
</p>
<p>earnest while he was telling me this story, and at
</p>
<p>intervals wept bitterly. I asked him if he had informed President Young of these particulars, and
</p>
<p>he answered me that he had seen President Young
</p>
<p>that same morning and had related to him the
</p>
<p>circumstances as he had told them to me."

<p>E. H. ANDERSON,
</p>
<p>Notary Public, Weber County.
</p>
<p>It appears to me that is pretty straight testimony. Place these three pieces of reliable evidence against the statement of John D. Lee, the
</p>
<p>assassin, the butcher of women and children.
</p>
<p>Whose testimony would you receive if you were
</p>
<p>sitting on a jury? Would you believe the testimony of these three men of undoubted veracity, or
</p>
<p>the testimony of this cut-throat? I think you would
</p>
<p>preferSthe testimony I have just read to you, at
</p>
<p>least I know I would, and I judge you by myself.
</p>
<p>We are apt to measure other people's cloth by
</p>
<p>our yard-stick.
</p>
<p>I will now read to you a very small portion of
</p>
<p>a letter to Secretary Belknap from President
</p>
<p>Young. The letter of President Young is under
</p>
<p>date of May 21, 1872. It is on file in the department at Washington:
</p>
<p>"In 1858, when Alfred Cumming was governor

<p>of Utah Territory, I pledged myself to lend him

<p>and the court every assistance in my power, in

</p>
<p>Mountain Meadows massacre and bring if possible
</p>
<p>the guilty parties to justice. That offer I have made
</p>
<p>again and again, and although it has not yet been
</p>
<p>accepted, I have neither doubt nor fear that the
</p>
<p>perpetrators of that tragedy will meet their just
</p>
<p>reward. But sending an armed force is not the
</p>
<p>means of furthering the ends of justice, although

</p>
<p>ular clamor against the "Mormons." In 1859,
</p>
<p>Judge Cradlebough employed a military force to
</p>
<p>attempt the arrest of those alleged criminals. He
</p>
<p>engaged in all about four hundred men, some of
</p>
<p>whom were civilians, reputed gamblers, 'thieves
</p>
<p>and other camp followers, who were doubtless intended for jurors (as his associate, Judge Eccles,
</p>
<p>had just done in another district); but these accomplished absolutely nothing further than plundering hen-roosts, and render themselves obnoxious
</p>
<p>to the citizens on their line of march. Had Judge
</p>
<p>Cradlebough instead of preemptorily dismissing his
</p>
<p>grand jury and calling for that military posse
</p>
<p>allowed the investigation into the Mountain Meadows massacre to proceed, I have the authority of Mr.
</p>
<p>Wilson, U. S. prosecuting attorney, for saying the
</p>
<p>investigation was proceeding satisfactorily, and I
</p>
<p>firmly believe, if the county sheriffs, whose legal
</p>
<p>duty it was to make arrests, had been lawfully
</p>
<p>directed to serve the processes, that they would
</p>
<p>have performed their duty and the accused would
</p>
<p>have been brought to trial. Instead of honoring
</p>
<p>the law Judge Cradlebough took a course to screen
</p>
<p>offenders, who could easily hide from such a posse
</p>
<p>under the justification of avoiding a trial by court
</p>
<p>martial.
</p>
<p>"It is now fourteen years since the tragedy was
</p>
<p>enacted, and the courts have never tried to prosecute the accused; although some of the judges, like
</p>
<p>Judge Hawley, have used every opportunity to
</p>
<p>charge the crime upon prominent men in Utah,
</p>
<p>and influence public opinion against our community."
</p>
<p>Here is President Young's statement to che Secretary of War at Washington, that he had offered

<p>personally to Governor Cumming and Judge Cradlebaugh to do all in his power to trace up the

<p>massacre to its proper source. At that time Prest.
</p>
<p>Young was firmly of the conviction that no white
</p>
<p>man had been engaged in the massacre. The perpetrators of the massacre were sworn to secrecy, as
</p>
<p>I have read to you. They were bound together
</p>
<p>not to tell. If anybody did tell he was to be killed.
</p>
<p>The mouths of those who knew were closed. President Young, therefore, had no idea that any white
</p>
<p>man was engaged in the deed; and when the rumor came that white men had been engaged in it
</p>
<p>he would not believe a word of it. And here we
</p>
<p>see that he offered to investigate the matter. Cradlebaugh came here at the time Governor Cumming came. He and Judge Eccles and Judge Sinclair were the three associate justices of Utah then
</p>
<p>appointed. Cradlebaugh was appointed to the
</p>
<p>southern district. He held his court at Provo, and
</p>
<p>he sent to Camp Floyd for the assistance of the
</p>
<p>military to help serve the processes of his court;
</p>
<p>but on an appeal being made to Governor Cumming to prevent the military from acting in this
</p>
<p>capacity, he issued his proclamation against this
</p>
<p>usurpation of the military, and because of this,
</p>
<p>the governor being sustained by the war department, and Cradlebaugh failing in his ulterior designs, no further effort was made to ferret out the
</p>
<p>criminals who were engaged in the Mountain
</p>
<p>Meadows massacre. The object of Judge Cradlebaugh was to criminate President Young; he did
</p>
<p>not care about anybody else, as I will prove to you

<p>from his own statement. I want you to pay particular attention to Judge Cradlebaugh's remarks:,,.:
</p>
<p>AIASSA CRE.
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>"If it is expected that this court is to be used
</p>
<p>by this community as a means of protecting it
</p>
<p>against the peccadilloes of Gentiles and Indians,
</p>
<p>unless this community will punish its.own murderers, such expectations will not be realized. It
</p>
<p>will be used for no such purpose. When this people shall come to their reason, and manifest a disposition to punish their own high offenders, it will
</p>
<p>then be time to enforce the law also for their protection. If this court cannot bring you to a proper sense of your duty, it can, at least, turn the savages held in custody loose upon you."
</p>
<p>This he proceeded to do, turning loose both
</p>
<p>Indians and white savages who had come into the
</p>
<p>Territory. His object was to try and implicate
</p>
<p>President Young, and have him arrested by this
</p>
<p>military posse, and brought before his court.
</p>
<p>Judge Sinclair tried the same thing here in this
</p>
<p>city, but did not succeed. Orders came from Washington that the military could not be used in executing the processes of civil courts, whereupon
</p>
<p>Judge Cradlebaugh, finding he could not implicate
</p>
<p>the authorities of the Church, nor force them before
</p>
<p>his court, got mad and turned loose all the criminals in custody in his district, as he describes them,
</p>
<p>"savages and others."
</p>
<p>I will read to you now just a little extract from
</p>
<p>Stenhouse's book, page 401:
</p>
<p>"The machinery of the courts was soon set in
</p>
<p>motion. The chief justice preferred the military
</p>
<p>camp for his residence. Associate Justice Sinclair

</p>
<p>"Up to this time the govorner of the Territory
</p>
<p>had also been Superintendent of Indian affairs, but
</p>
<p>on the appointment of Governor Cumming, the
</p>
<p>office of Superintendent was conferred upon Jacob
</p>
<p>Forney, of Pennsylvania. Alexander Wilson, of
</p>
<p>Iowa, was appointed district attorney of the Territory, and thus was completed the full list of
</p>
<p>federal officials."
</p>
<p>You will see that the office of governor went out
</p>
<p>of the hands of President Young about that time.
</p>
<p>When the army came in Cumming superseded
</p>
<p>him as governor, and Jacob Forney as agent of
</p>
<p>Indian affairs. But it is claimed that President
</p>
<p>Young was agent of Indian affairs at the time of
</p>
<p>the massacre, and ought to have reported this massacre to the authorities at Washington. Well, before he went out of office he did make a report.
</p>
<p>Let us see what it is like. It is published in Bishop's book:
</p>
<p>OFFICE OF SUPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,
</p>
<p>G. S. L. CITY, Jan 6th, 1858.
</p>
<p>Hon. James TV. Denver, Commissioner of Indian
</p>
<p>Affairs, Washington City, 1. C.:
</p>
<p>SIR: On or about the middle of last September,
</p>
<p>a company of emigrants traveling the southern
</p>
<p>route to California, poisoned the meat of an ox that
</p>
<p>died and gave it to the Indians to eat, causing the
</p>
<p>immediate death of four of their tribe, and poisoning several others. This company also poisoned
</p>
<p>the water where they were encamped. This occurred at Corn Creek, fifteen miles south of Fillmore
</p>
<p>City. This conduct so enraged the Indians that
</p>
<p>they immediately took measures for revenge. I

<p>Counties: "About the 22nd of September Captain
</p>
<p>Fancher &amp; Co. fell victims to the Indians' wrath
</p>
<p>near Mountain Meadows. Their cattle and horses
</p>
<p>were shot down in every direction; their wagons
</p>
<p>and property mostly committed to the flames."
</p>
<p>Lamentable as this case truly is, it is only the natural consequence of that fatal policy which treated
</p>
<p>the Indians like wolves, or other ferocious beasts.
</p>
<p>I have vainly remonstrated for years with travelers against pursuing so suicidal a policy, and repeatedly advised the government of its fatal tendency. It is not always upon the heads of the
</p>
<p>individuals who commit such crimes that sucl
</p>
<p>condign punishment is visited, but more frequently
</p>
<p>the next company that follows in their fatal path
</p>
<p>become the unsuspecting victims, though, peradventure, perfectly innocent."
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>On page 310 of the some book is the text of a
</p>
<p>letter to the same department, dated September 12,
</p>
<p>1857, in which President Young advises some
</p>
<p>measures to be adopted, either to prevent the emigrants coming or to provide measures for their
</p>
<p>preservation.
</p>
<p>Now, you see, Governor Young did report this
</p>
<p>as he was in duty bound to, and after making this
</p>
<p>report he was superseded, as I have told you, by
</p>
<p>Jacob Forney, as Indian agent.
</p>
<p>I want to read to you now a word or two as to
</p>
<p>what Jacob Forney had to say on the subject. It
</p>
<p>appears on page 40 of Cradlebaugh's speech in
</p>
<p>Congress, and is a report to the department at
</p>
<p>Washington:; '\ ~ "GREAT SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 22nd, 1859.

<p>names of those who I believe were not only implicated, but the hell-deserving scoundrels who concocted a part to the successful termination of the
</p>
<p>whole affair."
</p>
<p>Thus, Jacob Forney made a report to the authorities at Washington, but no steps were taken to
</p>
<p>investigate the matter.
</p>
<p>President Young then had gone out of office,
</p>
<p>both as governor and as superintendent of Indian
</p>
<p>affairs, and he was not responsible for any investigation in the matter in an official capacity. As
</p>
<p>you will perceive, there were some attempts made
</p>
<p>by the different governors and judges who rapidly
</p>
<p>succeeded each other, to show some interest in this
</p>
<p>affair. Their feeble efforts, however, were directed towards implicating President Young, and there
</p>
<p>was no real endeavor to convict the actual criminals ever made until Sumner Howard, U. S. district
</p>
<p>attorney for this Territory, prosecuted John D. Lee
</p>
<p>on his seec nd trial. Previous to that all pretended
</p>
<p>efforts were directed towards criminating Brigham
</p>
<p>Young and the "Mormon" Church; no sincere
</p>
<p>movements were made to ferret out the persons who
</p>
<p>perpetrated this deed. President Young, not being
</p>
<p>acquainted with the facts in the matter, took no
</p>
<p>steps to punish Lee. He was profoundly impressed
</p>
<p>with the idea that the deed had been perpetrated

<p>by the Indians. This explains the reason why

<p>President Young, not now Governor Young, did

<p>of Hon. Erastus Snow, whose word no one who
</p>
<p>knows him will dispute for a moment:
</p>
<p>TERRITORY OF UTAH, {
</p>
<p>County of Salt Lake. ss
</p>
<p>Personally appeared before me, the undersigned,
</p>
<p>a notary public in and for said county, Erastus
</p>
<p>Snow, who, being first duly sworn, on his oath
</p>
<p>says: I am a citizen of the United States and resident of the Territory of Utah, over the age of 21
</p>
<p>years. That inasmuch as President B. Young has
</p>
<p>been reproached for not expelling from the Church
</p>
<p>of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John D. Lee,
</p>
<p>immediately after the Mountain Meadows massacre
</p>
<p>instead of waiting until October 8th, 1870; the
</p>
<p>reason was that President Young and other authorities of said Church in Salt Lake City were in
</p>
<p>ignorance of the full facts relating to John D. Lee's
</p>
<p>connection therewith; by the false representations
</p>
<p>made by said Lee, as Indian farmer, to Governor
</p>
<p>Brigham Young, to the effect that the Indians were
</p>
<p>alone responsible for that slaughter, and that Lee
</p>
<p>and others visited the scene in the interests of
</p>
<p>peace, but were unable to restrain them. After
</p>
<p>colonies of our people began to locate in Washington County, in the years 1861, 1862 and 1863, and
</p>
<p>I was sent there to preside over them, I began to
</p>
<p>learn from various persons, little by little, the facts
</p>
<p>in the case, which satisfied me that the said Lee
</p>
<p>had taken a direct hand with the Indians in that
</p>
<p>affair; and I felt it my duty to acquaint the Presidency of the Church with the facts so far as I had
</p>
<p>been able to gather them.
</p>
<p>Bishop L. W. Roundy, of Kannarra, some ten
</p>
<p>miles from Lee's ranch, was also engaged as well,
</p>
<p>K
</p>
<p>thereto. President Young made a visiting tour

<p>Fall of the year 1870. I met him at Kannarra, on
</p>
<p>his downward trip, and took him and Bishop L.
</p>
<p>W. Roundy by themselves; Roundy is now dead;
</p>
<p>and communicated to President Young the facts as
</p>
<p>we had learned them, and the sources of our information. It made a profound impression on
</p>
<p>President Young; he expressed great astonishment, and said if such were the facts, Lee had
</p>
<p>added to his crime lying and deceit to him, and
</p>
<p>wondered how and why those facts had been so
</p>
<p>long concealed from him. On his return to Salt
</p>
<p>Lake City President Young called a council of the
</p>
<p>Twelve Apostles of the Church, and laid the facts
</p>
<p>before them, and President Young himself proposed, and all present unanimously voted to expel
</p>
<p>John D. Lee and Isaac C. Haiglit, who was his
</p>
<p>superior officer in the Church, for failing to restrain
</p>
<p>him, and to take prompt action against him, and
</p>
<p>President Young gave instructions at that time
</p>
<p>that John D. Lee should, under no circumstances,
</p>
<p>ever be again admitted as a member of the Church.
</p>
<p>During the following Winter, while Presidents
</p>
<p>Brigham Young and George A. Smith were at my
</p>
<p>home in St. George, Lee made application to me
</p>
<p>to intercede for him to obtain an interview with
</p>
<p>them; but when I spoke to them about it they
</p>
<p>both positively declined to see him or receive any
</p>
<p>communication from him.

<p>Now, you will see how the facts first came to the: cognizance of President Young. Brother Erastus

</p>
<p>them up, and when he had gathered certain facts
</p>
<p>he laid them before President Young. It was
</p>
<p>found that Lee had added lying and deceit to his
</p>
<p>deeper crimes, and he was cut off the Church and
</p>
<p>denied re-admission.
</p>
<p>Now, suppose that Lee was an accomplice of
</p>
<p>Brigham Youngs, that Brigham Young was an
</p>
<p>accessory either before or after the fact, would he
</p>
<p>have dared to take these steps against Lee or
</p>
<p>Haight? No. If Lee and Haight had received
</p>
<p>instructions from President Young, or the latter
</p>
<p>had palliated or condoned the crime, would Prest.
</p>
<p>Young have cut them off the Church of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that without a
</p>
<p>remedy?
</p>
<p>At Lee's first trial he was not convicted. The
</p>
<p>jury was composed partly of "Mormons" and partly of non-Mormons; but the jury disagreed. And
</p>
<p>if you had read the testimony as I have done, you
</p>
<p>would see that in refusing to bring in a verdict of
</p>
<p>"guilty,'" they who did so were justified, because
</p>
<p>the crime was not then clearly traced to Lee. One
</p>
<p>of the main objects of the prosecution then was to
</p>
<p>implicate the higher ecclesiastical authorities of
</p>
<p>the "Mormon" Church. But, of course, they were
</p>
<p>not on trial. Mr. Baskin for the prosecution said:
</p>
<p>"The country does not want to see that old man
</p>
<p>hanged; it only wants to see the fair fame of the
</p>
<p>country vindicated."
</p>
<p>And he went on to arraign the "N:I. and Brigham Young as "command

<p>der and spoliate." And it is admitted in the Tribune report of that trial, page 6, that
</p>
<p>"The prosecuting officers, in dealing with this
</p>
<p>great crime, were less desirous to convict and punish the prisoner than to get at the long-concealed
</p>
<p>facts of that case. The impression that there was
</p>
<p>'some person (or persons), high in the estimation
</p>
<p>of the people,' at the bottom of the affair, had
</p>
<p>grown to be a settled conviction; and as Lee had
</p>
<p>been a subordinate actor in the massacre it was
</p>
<p>thought that the ends of justice would be attained
</p>
<p>by releasing this man if he was honest in his
</p>
<p>avowed resolution to tell it all."
</p>
<p>At the second trial the evidence was plain and
</p>
<p>direct as to Lee's complicity in the massacre; he
</p>
<p>was convicted by "Mormon" testimony, and a verdict of "guilty" was brought in against him by a
</p>
<p>"Mormon" jury-I have a list of their names,* all
</p>
<p>members of the "Mormon" Church. Strange thing,
</p>
<p>was it not, to have a "Mormon" jury? It would
</p>
<p>be singular in these times. But John D. Lee was
</p>
<p>convicted by a "Mormon" jury, a thing said by
</p>
<p>some of the newspapers, extracts from which I
</p>
<p>have read to you, to be "impossible."
</p>
<p>All this goes to show to this audience and to the
</p>
<p>world that the charge of this massacre cannot be
</p>
<p>laid to the "Mormon Church," to George A. Smith,
</p>
<p>to Brigham Young or to the Twelve Apostles; it

</p>
<p>participated in the massacre. But it is very evident from the testimony, both on the first and on
</p>
<p>the second Lee trial, that but few white men fired
</p>
<p>a gun. Most of the massacre was.done by the
</p>
<p>Indians, who were armed, some of them with guns
</p>
<p>and some with bows and arrows. I could bring
</p>
<p>you a mass of testimonies given at the two trials
</p>
<p>to show how these white men came to go to the
</p>
<p>Meadows; that they were "lured" by Haight, and
</p>
<p>Lee, and Klingensmith. They were told to go
</p>
<p>there with guns and spades; that the Indians had
</p>
<p>attacked the emigrants, and that they were wanted
</p>
<p>to help bury the dead, and protect the emigrants.
</p>
<p>They were not told to go there and kill the emigrants, and it is very clear that very few of them
</p>
<p>took any active part in the massacre. After the
</p>
<p>terrible deed was done, however, they were all
</p>
<p>sworn to secrecy, and kept their oaths for a while.
</p>
<p>But the thing began to leak out. It was too horrible,
</p>
<p>too wicked, too much against their religion to keep.
</p>
<p>Every person who belongs to the Church of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ of Latter-day Saints, and understands the
</p>
<p>doctrines of the Church, and has a particle of the
</p>
<p>spirit of this gospel, knows that it is not the spirit
</p>
<p>of its members to shed blood, knows that the doctrines of the Church teach to the contrary, and
</p>
<p>that it is looked upon as the very worst of crimes
</p>
<p>for a man to kill his fellow-man. As I showed you
</p>
<p>two weeks ago in a discourse on "blood atonement,"
</p>
<p>there were certain capital sins that could not be
</p>
<p>atoned for except by the shedding of the person's own
</p>
<p>blood, and that after a person has received certain

<p>ordinances and made certain covenants, and then
</p>
<p>commits murder he cannot be forgiven in this
</p>
<p>world or in the world to come. That is the doctrine of this Church.
</p>
<p>How, then, can this people be accused of complicity in a crime which is right against their feelings, contrary to their faith, prohibited by the revelations, which they believe to be the revelations
</p>
<p>of God, opposed to the public teachings and the
</p>
<p>private instructions of the leaders of the Church
</p>
<p>right in the face of the positive injunctions of
</p>
<p>those leaders not to shed blood under any circumstances except in self-defense.
</p>
<p>I think I have made out a case that Brigham
</p>
<p>Young was not an accessory after the fact. I will
</p>
<p>have to pass over some items I would like to have
</p>
<p>brought before the congregation, all in this same
</p>
<p>line of argument; but I will skip them owing to
</p>
<p>the lateness of the hour. It was said that some
</p>
<p>property was brought into Salt Lake City from
</p>
<p>Mountain Meadows and that Brigham Young got
</p>
<p>possession of it while Captain Hooper bought the
</p>
<p>stock. Allow me to read a little more front Bishop,
</p>
<p>page 268. Here is what John D. Lee said after he
</p>
<p>was condemned to death:
</p>
<p>"But is there no help for the widow's son? I
</p>
<p>can no longer expect help from the Church or
</p>
<p>those of the Mormon faith. If I escape execution it
</p>
<p>will be through the clemency of the nation, many
</p>
<p>of whose noble sons will dislike to see me sacrificed
</p>
<p>in this way. I acknowledge that I have been slow
</p>
<p>to listen to the advice of friends, who have warned
</p>
<p>me of the danger and treachery that awatied me,

</p>
<p>yet I ask pardon for all the ingratitude with which
</p>
<p>I received their advice. When the people consider
</p>
<p>that I was ever taught to look upon treachery
</p>
<p>with horror, and that I have never permitted one
</p>
<p>nerve or fibre of this old frame to weaken or give
</p>
<p>way, notwithstanding I have been cut loose, and
</p>
<p>cast off and sacrificed by those who from their own
</p>
<p>standpoint, and according to their own theory,
</p>
<p>should have stood by me to the last, they may
</p>
<p>have some compassion for me. Perhaps all is for
</p>
<p>the best."
</p>
<p>You see there is an intimation in that, that he \
</p>
<p>thought he might perhaps escape punishment.
</p>
<p>There was considerable reason perhaps for that.
</p>
<p>It is stated that there was an agreement made
</p>
<p>between John D. Lee and Sumner Howard, the
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorney, and Mr. Nelson, who was
</p>
<p>then U. S. Marshal, and is now one of the editors
</p>
<p>of the Salt Lake Tribune, that John D. Lee should
</p>
<p>make out these documents that they might publish them to the world and make money out of it;
</p>
<p>but I will not enter into the evidences of that tonight. But John D. Lee had an idea that perhaps
</p>
<p>there was a loop-hole through which he might
</p>
<p>escape. His first confession did not suit. He
</p>
<p>made up a "confession" at the first trial for Messers Carey and Baskin who were the prosecuting
</p>
<p>attorneys on that occasion, and it was supposed
</p>
<p>that that confession would save a great deal of
</p>
<p>trouble at that trial. The substance of that confession is published in this Tribune pamphlet. After
</p>
<p>giving an account of the massacre the report says:
</p>
<p>"But the statement goes no further in its implication than the local leaders who directed the

<p>complicity of the higher ecclesiasts from whom
</p>
<p>the order emanated."
</p>
<p>It was for that reason it did not suit, for as I
</p>
<p>have already shown you the real object at that trial
</p>
<p>was if possible to criminate Brigham Young. Now
</p>
<p>I want to read to you a short paragraph from Mr.
</p>
<p>Howard's statement at the next trial, when John
</p>
<p>D. Lee was convicted:
</p>
<p>'District Attorney Howard opened the case to
</p>
<p>the jury for the prosecution. He reviewed the
</p>
<p>history of the case, and announced that he came
</p>
<p>here to try John D. Lee, and not Brigham Young,
</p>
<p>and the Mormon Church, who were not indicted.
</p>
<p>He intended to try John D. Lee for acts committed by Lee personally. He recited to the jury the
</p>
<p>facts which he proposed to prove by competent testimony as to John D. Lee's guilt in the case."
</p>
<p>After he had made his opening speech, Mr. W.
</p>
<p>W. Bishop, the publisher of this book, said:
</p>
<p>"He was glad to hear that Brigham Young and
</p>
<p>the Mormon Church were not on trial in this
</p>
<p>case. It was the first time in Utah that he had
</p>
<p>the pleasure of trying the case on its own merits."
</p>
<p>Mr Bishop here acknowledges that the attempt before was merely to implicate Brigham
</p>
<p>Young and the "Mormon" Churchl; but now John
</p>
<p>D. Lee was on his trial on his own merits. The
</p>
<p>"Mormon" Church and Brigham Young were not
</p>
<p>then on trial.
</p>
<p>At the close of the second trial U. S. District
</p>
<p>Attorney Sumner Howard,
</p>
<p>"In his opening address, repeated again that he
</p>
<p>had come for the purpose of trying John D. Lee,
</p>
<p>because the evidence lead and pointed to him as
</p>
<p>the main instigator and leader, and he had given

</p>
<p>proving that the authorities of tle Mormon Ch urcl
</p>
<p>knew nothing of the butchery until after it was
</p>
<p>committed, and that Lee, in his letter.to President
</p>
<p>Young a few weeks later, had knowingly misrepresented the actual facts relative to the massacre,
</p>
<p>seeking to keep him still in the dark and in ignorance.
</p>
<p>"He had received all the assistance any United
</p>
<p>States official could ask on earth in any case.
</p>
<p>Nothing had been kept back, and he was determined to clear the calendar of every indictment
</p>
<p>against any and every actual guilty participator
</p>
<p>in the massacre, but he did not intend to prosecute any one that had been lured to the meadows at the time, many of whom were only young
</p>
<p>boys and knew nothing of the vile plan which
</p>
<p>Lee originated and carried out for the destruction of the emigrants."
</p>
<p>Now, in regard to what became of the property
</p>
<p>said to have been taken from Mountain Meadows,
</p>
<p>I will refer to John D. Lee's statement, page 245:
</p>
<p>"The bodies were all searched by Higbee, Klingensmith and Wm. C. Stewart. I did hold the hat
</p>
<p>a while, but I soon got so sick that I had to give it
</p>
<p>to some other person, as I was unable to stand for
</p>
<p>a few minutes. The sealo1h resulted in getting a
</p>
<p>little money and a few watches, but there was not
</p>
<p>much money.
</p>
<p>Higbee and Klingensmith kept
</p>
<p>the property, I suppose, for I never knew what became of it, unless they did keep it. I think they
</p>
<p>kept it all."
</p>
<p>It was currently reported that Brigham Young
</p>
<p>gobbled it all. In regard to the cattle that Capt.
</p>
<p>Hooper was supposed to have obtained. It was
</p>
<p>stated in Congress that Hooper had the cattle that

<p>came from the Mountain Meadows. I will read

<p>Please exonerate him from all blame or censure of

</p>
<p>On page 250, Lee declares Klingensmith sold
</p>
<p>these cattle; that he and Haight kept all the proceeds and started a mercantile business with it in
</p>
<p>Cedar City. I give that for what it may be worth,
</p>
<p>but it goes to disprove that Brigham Young obtained any of the ill-gotten property.
</p>
<p>John D. Lee was taken to the Mountain Meadows and there shot for the crime committed, on the
</p>
<p>23rd of March, 1877. This was done for dramatic
</p>
<p>effect. It is between 80 and 90 miles from Beaver,
</p>
<p>where he was convicted. I do not think that such
</p>
<p>a thing as moving a criminal for execution to the
</p>
<p>spot where his crime was committed was ever done
</p>
<p>before within the limits of the United States. If
</p>
<p>it has been I am not aware of it. But the object
</p>
<p>of it was to make the book sell a little better.
</p>
<p>The book is a dramatic one, and the crime to
</p>
<p>Gil
</p>
<p>which it related was made to have a dramatic teri mination.

<p>I will now read to you a few words taken down
</p>
<p>H!": from the lips of President John Taylor in regard
</p>
<p>A;i
</p>
<p>to this matter. I want you to understand his sentiments in regard to this affair. It was written in

<p>the Winter of 1882:

</p>
<p>That bloody tragedy has been Ihe chief stock-intrade for penny-a-liners, and press and pulpit, who
</p>
<p>have gloated in turns by chorus over the sickening
</p>
<p>details. 'Do you deny it?' No. 'Do you excuse
</p>
<p>it?' No. There is no excuse for such a relentless,
</p>
<p>diabolical, sanguinary deed. That outrageous infamy is looked upon with as much abhorrence by
</p>
<p>our people as by any other parties in this nation
</p>
<p>or in the world, and at its first announcement its
</p>
<p>loathing recital chilled the marrow and sent a
</p>
<p>thrill of horror through the breasts of the listeners. It was most certainly a horrible deed, and
</p>
<p>like many other defenseless tragedies, it is one of
</p>
<p>those things that cannot be undone. The world is
</p>
<p>full of deeds of crime and darkness. and the question often arises, Who is responsible therefor? It
</p>
<p>is usual to blame the perpetrators. It does not
</p>
<p>seem fall to accuse nations, states and communities
</p>
<p>for deeds perpetrated by some of their citizens,
</p>
<p>unless they uphold it."

</p>
<p>I have read this that you may know the senti-!
</p>
<p>ments of the present President of the Church in
</p>
<p>regard to this crime, and I think his sentiments
</p>
<p>will be endorsed by every Latter-day Saint.
</p>
<p>I have read to you to-night a number of the
</p>
<p>stories circulated in regard to this matter, laying
</p>
<p>this massacre to the body of the "Mormon" Church.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of my remarks I read copiously
</p>
<p>from
</p>
<p>papers published in different parts of the
</p>
<p>world, showing that the crime was broadly charged!( l ] to the Latter-day Saints. I might also read to you
</p>
<p>li|". ' from the Salt Lake Tribune, but I will not detain
</p>
<p>I\ 'f:- you. That paper has over and over again laid this
</p>
<p>' crime at the door of the "Mormon" Church. These
</p>
<p>bugaboo stories put me in mind a great deal of: the boy's essay on pins. After several amusing.:,

<p>lives, by reason of their not swallowing of them."
</p>
<p>Whenever these stories are swallowed they produce
</p>
<p>poisonous effects. They are injurious to the vision.
</p>
<p>And that is the object for which they are used,
</p>
<p>that the eyes of the people may be blinded, so that
</p>
<p>when the Elders go forth with the gospel of Christ,
</p>
<p>people, being blinded through prejudice, will not
</p>
<p>be willing to receive it. The clergy have helped
</p>
<p>to spread abroad these infamous stories. I think
</p>
<p>I have proved to-night that the "Mormon" people
</p>
<p>are not guilty of this massacre in any way; that
</p>
<p>the "Mormon" Church, as an organization, is not
</p>
<p>responsible for it; that George A. Smith merely
</p>
<p>went south, as some did to the north, to warn the
</p>
<p>people in regard to the waste of grain and flour,
</p>
<p>and other provisions; that he did not speak against
</p>
<p>this company of emigrants at all, for he did not
</p>
<p>know of their existence until he was on his way
</p>
<p>back. I think I have proved to you that Brigham
</p>
<p>Young was not an accessory before the fact, nor an
</p>
<p>accessory after the fact; that when the facts came
</p>
<p>to the knowledge of President Young he then and
</p>
<p>there excommunicated John D. Lee and Isaac C.
</p>
<p>Haight from the Church and would not allow them
</p>
<p>to enter again; that Brigham Young's name stands
</p>
<p>to-day clear from the guilt which malignant people
</p>
<p>have tried to fasten upon it. Brigham Young was
</p>
<p>not a man of blood, nor even a warrior, but a philanthropist and a statesman-a statesman of a very
</p>
<p>high order. His soul did not delight in physical
</p>
<p>conflict, nor in the shedding of blood. I could

</p>
<p>produce to you to-night sermon upon sermon from
</p>
<p>the Journal of Discourses in which he deprecates
</p>
<p>the shedding of blood. I could produce to you tonight, as I did two weeks ago, his teachings concerning the awful penalties attached to the shedding of the blood of a human being; and I think all
</p>
<p>this mass of testimony produced to-night goes to
</p>
<p>prove that neither Brigham Young nor the Church
</p>
<p>either authorized, or countenanced, or palliated, or
</p>
<p>excused in the least degree the horrible massacre
</p>
<p>at Mountain Meadows.
</p>
<p>And now I will bring to a close my remarks.
</p>
<p>Let us investigate. Let us be a thinking people,
</p>
<p>a reading people, a people that think for ourselves,
</p>
<p>(';' a people that will not be led away by any story
</p>
<p>/ A that may be spread abroad in the world. And let
</p>
<p>us help, to send forth the truth. I think we have
</p>
<p>been a little to blame in this matter. We have
</p>
<p>been continually assailed. Our enemies have told
</p>
<p>some of the most monstrous stories that it is capable
</p>
<p>for the mind of man to invent, his tongue to repeat or devils inspire him to pen. I think we
</p>
<p>should takela stand to expose these falsehoods, to
</p>
<p>defeat this influence, to place ourselves on record
</p>
<p>against them. I think the people called Latterday Saints should use the pen and the press to
</p>
<p>scatter truth broadcast in the world. We do not...... expect to meet all the lies they tell of us. A man
</p>
<p>can ask questions and bring forth by implication

<p>as much in an hour as would take ten years to re'l::

</p>
<p>to do so. We have been warned; now let us warn
</p>
<p>our neighbors. We have got the truth; let us
</p>
<p>spread it abroad. By the help of God we will labor to this end. I devoted myself to the work of
</p>
<p>spreading the truth in my boyhood. I feel just
</p>
<p>the same to-day; and I know I have been blessed
</p>
<p>of God in this labor. I know the Spirit and power
</p>
<p>of God is in this Church. I know this is the work
</p>
<p>of God. I know God has established it and I
</p>
<p>know He will bring it to a glorious consummation.
</p>
<p>I know that all the lies, the engines of destruction
</p>
<p>and all the influences, physical, or moral, or intellectual, that may be brought against this Church
</p>
<p>will ultimately fail. "Truth is mighty and will
</p>
<p>prevail." And while I live, by the help of God,
</p>
<p>I shall endeavor to do my part, both by tongue and
</p>
<p>pen, in defending my brethren and sisters and the
</p>
<p>servants of God in this Church from the malicious
</p>
<p>attacks and calumnies of their opponents, and in
</p>
<p>preaching the gospel of peace to the ends of the earth.
</p>
<p>To this I have consecrated my life, and in doing this
</p>
<p>I have done but the same as many others. I know
</p>
<p>my words find an echo in your hearts. You know
</p>
<p>as well as I do that this is the spirit of this Church,
</p>
<p>that the spiritof our leaders, the First Presidency, the
</p>
<p>Apostles and our leading men is peace. Our motto is "Peace on earth, good-will to all men." Our
</p>
<p>mission is salvation, not destruction. We come to
</p>
<p>save men's lives, not to destroy them.
</p>
<p>May God help us to labor in this spirit and give
</p>
<p>us strength and faith that we may accomplish the
</p>
<p>-ork unto which we are called, for Christ's sake. /
