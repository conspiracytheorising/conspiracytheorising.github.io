<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>The trial before the Military Commission in Cincinnati, just con-
</p>
<p>cluded, was in many respects one of the most remarkable events of
</p>
<p>the war. The investigation has elicited testimony of the most
</p>
<p>startling character, showing conclusively to the minds of all reason-
</p>
<p>able men who have given to it careful, earnest attention that there
</p>
<p>was a most formidable, deep and well arranged conspiracy, which,
</p>
<p>but for timely discovery and judicious action, would have resulted
</p>
<p>most disastrously, not only to the particular cities and towns specified
</p>
<p>and doomed to destruction, but to the whole country. None can
</p>
<p>contemplate the danger through which we have passed without a
</p>
<p>shudder and without a recognition of the hand of a merciful Provi-
</p>
<p>dence who has guided our beloved country in its darkest hours and
</p>
<p>who has crowned our struggles for liberty and union with glorious
</p>
<p>victory.
</p>
<p>To have proclaimed to the public, even a few short months ago,
</p>
<p>that a scheme had been concocted in Richmond, of so vast and for-
</p>
<p>midable a character, so insiduous in its operations, so complete in
</p>
<p>its details that it had found favor and support in all the great cities and towns in Illinois,
</p>
<p>Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, Iowa, and sections of other States that scarcely a
</p>
<p>village was exempt from its corruption, that it numbered in its ranks more traitors in the
</p>
<p>aggregate than the number of brave men in the combined armies of the gallant Grant and
</p>
<p>Sherman, and that all who had thus united recognised but one common cause  the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of our country, the defeat and humiliation of our people, and the triumph of the
</p>
<p>Rebellion  the author of such a proclamation would have been written down a madman or
</p>
<p>a fool, by most persons in the community ; and yet the developments before the military
</p>
<p>tribunal have established the fact, to the eternal infamy of all who were leagued in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy.
</p>
<p>As the trial opened, and the charges of the indictment were made public, all sympatisers
</p>
<p>with the conspiracy affected to disbelieve its existence, and raised their eyes and hands to
</p>
<p>Heaven, in pious horror, and prayed that justice might be meted out to the accused, who
</p>
<p>were, they claimed, the best of citizens, the most devout Christians, the most zealous

</p>
<p>patriots, the most earnest advocates of law and order, and that their aowuscrs might bo

<p>IV INTKODUCTION.
</p>
<p>shunned of all good men forever. To this prayer the accused will scarce utter the re-
</p>
<p>sponse, Amen ! Even some good, careful, honest Union men, astonished at the startling
</p>
<p>revelations, refused, for a time, to believe that there was any truth in the allegations
</p>
<p>against the prisoners ; by degrees, however, as corroborative evidence accumulated, the
</p>
<p>truth was forced upon their minds, and there are now few persons of ordinary intelligence
</p>
<p>and candor, who have not been able to discover that " there was something in it, after all,"
</p>
<p>and that we have been Providentially saved a most terrible disaster.
</p>
<p>But the investigation has been lengthy, and the reports in the newspapers have been
</p>
<p>brief and irregular, and few, comparatively, there are who have heard or read all of even
</p>
<p>the more important testimony, or appreciate fully the vast magnitude of the conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>and there are many who having read only the indictment, have conceived the idea that if
</p>
<p>the charges therein alleged are true, the crime was confined to a few desperate and wicked
</p>
<p>men in Chicago alone, and that, therefore, it possessed but a local interest. Such a con-
</p>
<p>clusion is wholly groundless. The history of this conspiracy is of the most vital interest
</p>
<p>for the people of every State in the Union, for had the conspirators not been foiled at a
</p>
<p>most opportune moment, their plans would have been successful in every particular, and
</p>
<p>once in operation they could not have been frustrated by any force we could have arrayed
</p>
<p>against them ; and who shall say that had the savage hordes of Jeff. Davis then been
</p>
<p>turned loose upon an unarmed community, to carry desolation and ruin as they should
</p>
<p>sweep over our fair States, that to-day the Southern rebels would be, as they now are, in
</p>
<p>their last extremity  that victory would now be perched upon our banners wherever our
</p>
<p>noble pioneers of freedom advance, and that our brave boys of the Potomac would now be
</p>
<p>reposing from their labors in the halls of the rebel capitol ! Those who, upon investiga-
</p>
<p>tion, fail to recognise the magnitude, the sagacity, the completeness of this Northwestern
</p>
<p>Conspiracy, and realise its immense importance to the rebel chieftains at the South, cor-
</p>
<p>roborated as the evidence before the Commission has been by incidents of almost daily
</p>
<p>occurrence for many months, have not learned to read correctly the history of the Great
</p>
<p>Southern Rebellion. If an idea ever entered the heads of malcontents at the North to
</p>
<p>establish a Northwestern Confederacy, it was speedily chased away by the more promising
</p>
<p>schemes of the arch traitor late of Richmond. It is to collect facts already elicited, and
</p>
<p>to give further information, and with a hope of aiding the cause of the Union so sacred
</p>
<p>and dear to us all, that the writer has yielded to the oft-repeated requests of his friends to
</p>
<p>present a connected and concise history of the Northwestern Conspiracy.

<p>THE AUTHOR.
</p>
<p>CHAP. I.
</p>
<p>ECRET SERVICE TO SECURE SUCCESS OF SOUTHERN ARMS  STATE SOV-
</p>
<p>EREIGNTY  The general purposes of secret Political organiza-
</p>
<p>tions  Recollections that can never die  Voices from our
</p>
<p>brave soldiers at the front, bespeaking our protection for
</p>
<p>their wives, children, parents and homes from northern
</p>
<p>Copperheads  Character of the leaders of the different secret
</p>
<p>ORDERS.
</p>
<p>The signal potency of secret organizations at the South prior to the secession
</p>
<p>of States, and indeed the only really effective machinery by which an attempt at
</p>
<p>disunion by the people could have been made to appear possible, early in the great
</p>
<p>struggle engaged the earnest attention of the Southern leaders. Knowing as they
</p>
<p>did that had the question of secession been primarily an open one, for free discus-
</p>
<p>sion, that the masses of the people would have rejected the proposition with
</p>
<p>deserved scorn and indignation, and hung the ambitious adventurers who dared
</p>
<p> propose the sacrilege. They realized the importance of establishing the order in
</p>
<p>the North. The leaders saw with delight the working of secret organizations,
</p>
<p>where men were sworn to secrecy, and drawn onward step by step, till they reached
</p>
<p>the very brink of the fearful precipice. Thus did the people fasten upon them-
</p>
<p>selves and each other the shackles of slavery, which they have since so unwillingly
</p>
<p>worn. The doctrine of State sovereignty proclaimed by John C. Calhoun, and
</p>
<p>which, together with its apostles, Jackson well knew how to receive, bad been
</p>
<p>instilled into the minds of the people of the States, which since their admission
</p>
<p>into the Union had been at war with destiny, and in the hope of securing perpe-
</p>
<p>tuity of their peculiar institutions, they attempted the disolution of the Union.
</p>
<p>Truly gratifying it must have been to the extremists in those States to have
</p>
<p>watched the gathering clouds, and to listen to the low murmuring thunder which
</p>
<p>pressaged the coming storm, and well they knew how fearful would be its fury,
</p>
<p>but blinded to the inevitable result, they were confident of ultimate success, when
</p>
<p>they should have so far disseminated the Calhoun poison at the North, as to have
</p>
<p>made oath  bound slaves in such numbers as would paralyze the efforts of Union
</p>
<p>men, and render it necessary to recall our armies from the field to suppress insur-

<p>6 TIIE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>knew the importance of introducing the machinery of secret political organiza-
</p>
<p>tions better than Davis himself, for he had not forgotten the Charleston Conven-
</p>
<p>tion, the working of the secret orders then, and subsequent events had of course
</p>
<p>confirmed him in the opinion that a divided North would not be a formidable
</p>
<p>adversary, and that he was warranted in the firm belief that his wish to be " let
</p>
<p>alone " would be realised. With these views, shrewd and sagacious men estab-
</p>
<p>lished themselves early in Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois and other States,
</p>
<p>and put the machinery in motion. The order sprung up in various sections of the
</p>
<p>country, and treason flourished well, as poisonous plants often show the greatest
</p>
<p>vitality. This plan was a success. Men high in rank and station  men from
</p>
<p>every profession and walk in life, embraced the principles of the order, and soon
</p>
<p>it could boast of legislators, judges of the higher courts, clergymen, doctors,
</p>
<p>lawyers, merchants and men from every avocation. Judge Bullitt, from the
</p>
<p>Supreme bench in Kentucky, Judge Morris of the Circuit Court of Illinois,
</p>
<p>Judd and Robinson, lawyers and candidates for the highest State offices, Col.
</p>
<p>Walker, agent of the State of Indiana, editors of the daily press, and men high
</p>
<p>in official station, and in the confidence of the people, ex-Governors of States and
</p>
<p>disaffected politicians, all seized upon this new element of power and with various
</p>
<p>motives, the chief of which was self agrandisement at any cost, even at the cost
</p>
<p>of our National existence  entered with zeal upon the work of disseminating the
</p>
<p>doctrines, and extending the organization throughout the North and West.
</p>
<p>The leaders gratified by success, courted the support of the organizations they
</p>
<p>fostered till the candidates for the highest offices in the State and Nation felt
</p>
<p>certain of obtaining election, were they but in favor with the secret orders they
</p>
<p>aided in establishing. While the leaders were men of cunning, many of them
</p>
<p>of intellect and education, the rank and file was made up of different material.
</p>
<p>It not being necessary by the tenets of the order that they should think at all,
</p>
<p>brains were at a discount  muscle only was required  beings who would fall into
</p>
<p>line at the word of command and follow on to an undertaking, however desperate
</p>
<p>and criminal, without asking or thinking, or caring for the purpose to be attained ;
</p>
<p>beings who could be put in harness and led or driven wherever and whenever it
</p>
<p>might suit their masters. Men from the lowest walks of life were preferred. In
</p>
<p>the lower strata of the order, social distinction was waived by the leaders, and the

</p>
<p>lowest wretch in the order was placed on a level with judges, merchants and
</p>
<p>politicians, at least within the hall of meeting, thus offering inducements potent
</p>
<p>enough to make the lodge room a place of interest and pleasure, and thus the
</p>
<p>organization thrived.
</p>
<p>It became known of course that secret organizations of a most dangerous class
</p>
<p>were in existence, and their fruits were easily recognized. Our brave boys in the
</p>
<p>army were often importuned by letters, to desert their posts and to betray their
</p>
<p>flag. Union men were subject to annoyances that became unendurable, soldiers
</p>
<p>wives and families were grossly insulted, soldiers visiting their homes upon
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 7
</p>
<p>furloughs were often assaulted or murdered, quarrels upon petty pretexts were in-
</p>
<p>cited, neighbors arrayed against each other, dwellings burned by incendiaries,
</p>
<p>unoffending union men murdered, military secrets of greatest importance betrayed,
</p>
<p>libels of the most gross and malicious character by such papers as the Chicago
</p>
<p>Times, and by such men as Wilbur F. Story, its editor, till at length a voice came
</p>
<p>to us from the army in the field, whiah was often echoed, begging Union citizens
</p>
<p>at home, by their love of the Union, by the love they bore their own families, to
</p>
<p>protect the absent soldiers' wives, mothers, sisters and firesides from the Copper-
</p>
<p>heads who remained at home ; they would meet the enemy at the front, they
</p>
<p>would march fearlessly to the cannon's belching throat, and meet death or mutila-
</p>
<p>tion upon the field of battle for their Country's cause ; not for themselves did
</p>
<p>they know fear or care for danger, but when the tidings came to them from home,
</p>
<p>when after toilsome marches, hunger and fatigue, or suffering from wounds received
</p>
<p>in desperate engagements, when resting a brief hour, and their eyes fell upon
</p>
<p>missives from home, from wives who bade them go and fight for freedom, and
</p>
<p>return not with shame upon their brows, when tender thoughts of home, of children
</p>
<p>and every " loved spot " that they had left behind, came crowding to their minds,
</p>
<p>who shall say that they were wanting in heroism if their faces became pale, their
</p>
<p>lips trembled and the tears dimmed their eyes, as they read of wrongs and insults
</p>
<p>endured from Copperheads at home, or of plots and acts by cowardly traitors to
</p>
<p>aid the common enemy ; and when their entreaty comes to us to strike down the
</p>
<p>deadly foe at home and give protection to the helpless, let him blush with shame
</p>
<p>to call himself a man, let him never claim to be an American citizen, never claim
</p>
<p>protection of our Country's flag, let him close his ears to the sound of rejoicing
</p>
<p>for final and complete victory, let him only hold companionship with cowards and
</p>
<p>with culprits, and hide himself from the light of day who will turn a deaf ear to
</p>
<p>the soldiers' prayer. Copperheads who have withheld their sympathy and their
</p>
<p>efforts for our country in its days of darkness and of peril, should and will be
</p>
<p>known of men in all future time ; their lives will be blighted, their names will be
</p>
<p>a reproach and a by -word, their children will blush for their parents, and the name
</p>
<p>of Benedict Arnold will no longer be the synonym of treason and betrayal  his
</p>
<p>name will be rescued from the infamy each passing year of the existence of our
</p>
<p>country has heaped upon it, and the Copperheads of the present day will receive

<p>the anathemas of all coming generations, till their very names shall be a curse too
</p>
<p>horrid for mortals to apply, and thenceforth be only echoed in the lowest depths
</p>
<p>of hell.
</p>
<p>By Providential discovery of the existence of the Order of Sons of Liberty in
</p>
<p>Chicago, and the utmost vigilance, prudence, perseverence, patience, promptness
</p>
<p>and daring, the aims, designs and acts of this Order, of the American Knights
</p>
<p>and kindred organizations have been brought to light, its every evil purpose and
</p>
<p>plan laid before the Government, and the pet institution of Jeff. Davis has been
</p>
<p>turned inside out, so that " he who runs may read " the curtain has been raised
</p>
<p>8 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and the light of noonday has heen let in, discovering to the public the horrid
</p>
<p>creation of traitors in our very midst  people who breathe the very air we do,
</p>
<p>who enjoy the same blessings and privileges, aye, and perhaps sit at the same
</p>
<p>tables. The friends and sympathizers of these traitors have sought to cast ob-
</p>
<p>loquy and distrust upon the statements of those who have successfully broken up
</p>
<p>the great conspiracy, and perjury has sought to blacken their reputations, but in
</p>
<p>vain. Truth will prevail.
</p>
<p>The list of names of the members of the Sons of Liberty have been obtained
</p>
<p>and preserved, and will be valuable for reference hereafter.
</p>
<p>As the reader passes down South Clark street, at the corner of Monroe, he
</p>
<p>will notice upon the right a large building of peculiar structure, and now bearing
</p>
<p>the name " Invincible Club Hall." It was here the temples of the Sons of Lib-
</p>
<p>erty, or, as they were then called, the " American Knights," held their secret
</p>
<p>sessions, going stealthily up the stairs singly or in groupes of two or three, to avoid
</p>
<p>observation, and when once inside the hall they were guarded by an outside sen-
</p>
<p>tinel, whose duty it was to apprise them of danger and to guard against its ap-
</p>

<p>CHAP. II.
</p>
<p>OREIGN Powers the enemies op Republican Government 
</p>
<p>Their part in the programme op the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>The event of the American revolution burst upon the world as the most
</p>
<p>startling era in the history of nations. Monarchical Europe had long
</p>
<p>envied the proud career and inevitable destiny of these States, which had
</p>
<p>been shaken as the brightest jewels from the British Crown. Monarchs, Empe-
</p>
<p>rors, Queens, lords, princes and diplomats, who wield the sceptre of dominion,
</p>
<p>could not conceal the joy afforded them by a scene, which executed, promised the
</p>
<p>speedy extinguishment of the leading national power on the globe, and the final
</p>
<p>demolition of the only altar of liberty upon which the fires of freedom had con-
</p>
<p>tinued bright.
</p>
<p>The event created the more joy, because it was attributable partly to the efforts
</p>
<p>so strenuously put forth for many preceding years by the combined enemies of
</p>
<p>American Independence, to poison the American mind and breed disunion in the
</p>
<p>ranks of a free, industrious and honest yeomanry, with a view to the ultimate
</p>
<p>dissolution of the bonds of the Union.
</p>
<p>These enemies, however, for some time anterior to the development of the fruit
</p>
<p>of their labors, had begun to despair of the cause in which they had engaged, and
</p>
<p>it is possible that the scheme of American wreck and ruin upon their part had
</p>
<p>been permanently abandoned, hence their immediate demonstrations of joy at the
</p>
<p>triumph of their cause of sedition.
</p>
<p>But seeds sown, however barren the soil, seldom fail of some growth, and sub-
</p>
<p>sequent to the presidential election of 1860, the great American rebellion became
</p>
<p>transparent to both friend and foe. To enumerate and examine in detail the
</p>
<p>different phases of the programme of artificial causes.which precipitated defiance
</p>
<p>of the General Government, and gave origin to the chronic disorder of the people
</p>
<p>of different eections upon the subject of their government, would occupy more
</p>
<p>space than has been allotted this brief narrative, which is more especially intended
</p>
<p>to embrace a readable compilation of the later movements of the enemies of the
</p>
<p>Government to crown the Confederate cause with success, through the bloody
</p>
<p>implement of Conspiracy and Revolution in the Northern States.

<p>I
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 11
</p>
<p>Having alluded to the prominent part occupied by foreign hostile powers in the
</p>
<p>general scheme of Conspiracy against the Federal Government, a brief allusion to
</p>
<p>the part executed by the native born American will not be out of place.
</p>
<p>The cheek tingles with the blush of shame, when alas, it must be said that the
</p>
<p>pride of the American has been humbled by his too faithful adherence to the
</p>
<p>grand original compact of treason, even after the second most potent auxiliary to
</p>
<p>the plan had been tenderly touched with the wickedness of the scheme, and had
</p>
<p>withdrawn in dismay at the approach of the enactment of crime so revolting.
</p>
<p>All things material and tangible have their bases and starting points, so too,
</p>
<p>had the Southern Rebellion its foundation stone laid deep and solid in the minds
</p>
<p>of the people by John C. Calhoun, the first great Supreme Commander of the
</p>
<p>germ from whence sprung the various elements of treason, which have entered
</p>
<p>into the composition of the powers seeking the destruction of the Federal Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. As for the doctrine of State Rights as expounded by Calhoun, it is carried
</p>
<p>beyond the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of '98, to that point which renders
</p>
<p>it destructive of the end for which it is claimed to be enunciated.
</p>
<p>It has been sought to carry the doctrine to that extremity beyond the exercise
</p>
<p>of its own reserved powers, which must inevitably bring it in collision with the
</p>
<p>legitimate operation of the powers delegated to the General Government.
</p>
<p>With this extreme, hence fallacious, doctrine of State Rights thus firmly
</p>
<p>imbedded in the hearts and heads of a zealous people, rendering them, upon
</p>
<p>conscientious principles, the ready tools of ambitious leaders, filled with lust for
</p>
<p>power and place, it should not be a matter of so much surprise, that, after years
</p>
<p>of uninterrupted and persistent education and training of the generations in their
</p>
<p>order, that the year of 1860 found the continent trembling beneath the crack of
</p>
<p>musketry, the tread of horse, and the roar of cannon.
</p>
<p>As among the more important means used by designing men in aid of the
</p>
<p>scheme of rebellion, and the ultimate establishment of a separate government
</p>
<p>in the South, the nucleus of which was to be the cotton states, secret organiza-
</p>
<p>tions, assuming different names and traditions in different localities in the South
</p>
<p>were established, having for their special mission in the meantime the privacy of
</p>
<p>the plot, and the education of the people to that indispensable standard of treason
</p>
<p>which would eventually lead them to avow their principles at the point of the

<p>sword.
</p>
<p>These organizations, in point of antiquity, are traced to a time not long anterior
</p>
<p>to the nullification of South Carolina in 1832, which was so promptly suppressed
</p>
<p>by General Jackson, then President of the United States. Some of them, how-
</p>
<p>ever, claim even greater antiquity, and point with affected pride to the historical
</p>
<p>period of the American colonial revolution against the taxation and tyranny of
</p>
<p>England, as the date of their origin. Whatever may be the facts as to the precise
</p>
<p>date of the existence, respectively, of these disreputable cables, laid to undermine
</p>
<p>the greatness and glory of the National Union, cemented as it is by the blood of
</p>
<p>12 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the sires and sages of the Revolution, is unimportant to the purpose of the author,
</p>
<p>while the great living fact that they have heen the most deadly weapon in the
</p>
<p>hands of the enemy is corroborated by the eventful history of the union of these
</p>
<p>States.
</p>
<p>Prior to the breaking out of the rebellion in 1861, these various organizations,
</p>
<p>being the van-guards in the general conspiracy against the integrity and per-
</p>
<p>petuity of the Federal Government, had not been introduced, to any great extent,
</p>
<p>in the non-slaveholding states, and in consequence thereof had little or no tangi-
</p>
<p>bility north of the compromise of 1820, familiarly known as Mason and Dixon's
</p>
<p>line. South of this line, however, they had long been standing institutions in
</p>
<p>every city, town, hamlet, villa and populated district throughout all of the late
</p>
<p>so-called Confederate States of America; vieing the Palmetto in rankness of
</p>
<p>growth, and rivaling the rattlesnake in deadness of poison, until at length, gorged
</p>
<p>with their own baneful offspring, and pale with the sickness of their own stomachs,
</p>
<p>the child of secession was born unto them as a curse and reproach to the Southern
</p>
<p>people and the generations to follow them forever.
</p>
<p>On the 17th of April, 1861, the report of the gun fired upon Port Sumpter was
</p>
<p>heard by every member of these secret conclaves in the South, and was the signal
</p>
<p>for the opening of the outer gates of every temple of treason in the land.
</p>
<p>Prom that inauspicious moment forward to the present, no mask has hid from
</p>
<p>the scorn of the Christian world treason's hideous visage, but that blear-eyed
</p>
<p>monster, armed with every weapon of iniquity which devilish invention could
</p>
<p>devise, has alternately, with rage and despair, rushed to and fro across the conti-
</p>
<p>nent, spilling the blood of innocence.
</p>
<p>When, upon the occurrence of the Presidential election in 1860, it was found
</p>
<p>that the kernel planted by Calhoun had been fostered to maturity by secret
</p>
<p>organization, the blood and treasure of seven states was at once staked upon
</p>
<p>the fearful result, and the disruption of the Republic and the erection of a
</p>
<p>slave-driving despotism upon the ruins solemnly declared. In the outset, it was
</p>
<p>thought by leading political minds at the North, that but little sincerity could be
</p>
<p>attached to the assertion of independence by the Southern people. But as time
</p>
<p>elapsed and the contest grew more formidable and bloody, Northern men began
</p>
<p>by degrees to comprehend the magnitude of a chronic conspiracy which had cost

</p>
<p>the life-long labors of its ablest advocates to prepare. And though the hosts en-
</p>
<p>listed in the execution of this conspiracy for a time won the prestige of victors
</p>
<p>upon fields of blood, knowledge of their sincerity of purpose and the extent of
</p>
<p>their carefully collected resources at length came to every loyal man in the
</p>
<p>country, and vigorous measures, corresponding to the necessity, were at once
</p>
<p>devised, the effects of which are now seen in the capture of Richmond and the
</p>
<p>surrender of Lee.
</p>
<p>Earlier than this date in the progress of the struggle, however, it became man-
</p>
<p>ifest that the wheel of fortune would eventually turn against the cause of the
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 13
</p>
<p>South in consequence of her comparative weakness to contend against a power so
</p>
<p>amply provided with the material of war as the government at Washington.
</p>
<p>Then it was that the project of enlarging the area of the rebellion, first fell upon
</p>
<p>the Southern mind as indispensable to their cause, now fast becoming desperate
</p>
<p>in the extreme. Hurried raids into border northern states gave to the prowess of
</p>
<p>southern arms but momentary eclat, and little or no enduring strength was added
</p>
<p>to the stability of the Richmond government, beyond the plunder obtained in the
</p>
<p>line of march. On the contrary, these raids, instead of being evidence of the
</p>
<p>power of the South to maintain the standard of independence, were looked upon
</p>
<p>by the military chieftains of the North, without apprehension further than the
</p>
<p>demoralization, consequent upon the particular neighborhoods and districts thus
</p>
<p>invaded. In fact each recurring raid gave additional grounds for the confident
</p>
<p>belief on the part of the North, that the downfall of the rebellion was but a ques-
</p>
<p>tion of time, much sooner to be solved than many people of both sections supposed.
</p>
<p>These symptoms of the distress of the cause meantime did not escape the sagacity
</p>
<p>of the leaders of the rebellion, and as an expedient remcrly, the plan of secretly
</p>
<p>organizing traitors in the northern states was determined upon as early as 1862,
</p>
<p>by the political representatives and agents of the confederate states, the attempt,

<p>As above intimated, early in 1862 the Richmond Government foresaw the
</p>
<p>necessity of bringing to its aid the hitherto comparatively dormant resources of
</p>
<p>treason in the Northern States, and the enlargement of the arena of the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>Raids having omniously failed in their design to arouse the lethargic spirits of
</p>
<p>Northern sympathizers and advocates, to rush to the standard of the misguided
</p>
<p>South, it was immediately determined to prolong the war, at least, to the date of
</p>
<p>the next Presidential election, and then through the agencies of secret organiza-
</p>
<p>tion and equipment, seize upon the excitement of the people in a hotly contested
</p>
<p>election, to force a rebellion against the administration elect in the North, as had
</p>
<p>been done in the South in 1860.
</p>
<p>The executive part of this object was at once given into the hands of such
</p>
<p>trustworthy men, both North and South, as were deemed suitable to the enterprise,
</p>
<p>and the work of secret political organization was vigorously begun in Northern
</p>
<p>Missouri and Kentucky, from thence it gradually spread, until it was firmly rooted
</p>
<p>in the political tenets of the minority party in the States of Illinois, Iowa, Indi-
</p>
<p>ana, Ohio, New York, and portions of other adjoining States.
</p>
<p>Much dissimilarity existed in the operative structure and formation of the
</p>
<p>various organizations, from time to time thus instituted. To give the public a full
</p>
<p>and complete description of these organizations, would be foreign to the writer's
</p>
<p>time, space and purpose, but in order that some record of their character
</p>
<p>may be made, a general description of each in its order in point of time, with a
</p>
<p>reference to the features in which radical dissimilarities appear, would seem indis-
</p>
<p>pensible to the poor perfection sought to be obtained by the author of these
</p>
<p>sketches.
</p>
<p>Upon the discovery by Southern leaders that their cause must fail unless " fire
</p>
<p>in the rear" was at once instigated in the North, the Order of the Knights of the
</p>
<p>Golden Circle, an old Southern institution, was infused with life, and began its

</p>
<p>pilgrimage Northward, one additional creed having been ingrafted upon it.
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 15
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that this Order was originally composed of the wealthiest
</p>
<p>planters, merchants and professional men of the South, and had for its sole object
</p>
<p>the inculcation of treason against the United States. It was simply an institution
</p>
<p>to educate the Southern mind to the required standard of rebellion. But when
</p>
<p>the Order was introduced into the North, it was found feasible to give it a double
</p>
<p>capacity, first that of an educational capacity, and second that of an incendiary
</p>
<p>capacity, which comprised the destruction of government property, and the houses
</p>
<p>and property of leading loyal citizens of the North, known to be strong advocates
</p>
<p>of the suppression of the rebellion. But this organization in name and cardinal
</p>
<p>purpose was short-lived, its career having subserved but a meagre benefit to the
</p>
<p>South, in a practical point of view. The damage it did was principally confined
</p>
<p>to the burning of United States transports on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,
</p>
<p>snd the moulding of the crude opinions of its members, which served as a solid
</p>
<p>foundation for the establishment of the Order of American Knights, which
</p>
<p>immediately succeeded its dissolution.
</p>
<p>Like all institutions of iniquity, the sun of the Order of Knights of the Golden
</p>
<p>Circle went down in blood, but was the signal for the advent of an Order better
</p>
<p>calculated to meet the ends of its design.
</p>
<p>It had been seen upon experiment that the Golden Circle had been successful
</p>
<p>beyond the most sanguine expectations of its instigators, and as the necessity of
</p>
<p>Northern revolution to insure the certain success of the Confederacy daily became
</p>
<p>more apparent to the rebels, both North and South, the Order of the American
</p>
<p>Knights was inaugurated  the executioner of that fell purpose. Its sun arose to
</p>
<p>its meridian with the suddenness of a meteor, doomed to flash across the canopy
</p>
<p>and burst in scattering atoms.
</p>
<p>The Order of American Knights was erected upon the dissolved fngments of
</p>
<p>the Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle, which Order, in name, was aban-
</p>
<p>doned for the additional reason that the suspicions of the Government had begun
</p>
<p>to be aroused as to the character of its movements. At the time of the extinction
</p>
<p>of the Golden Circle, its members were at once inducted into the Order of Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Knights, so that this Order obtained much primary advantage, in point of
</p>
<p>numerical strength, over its predecessor, for the Golden Circle had already insid-
</p>
<p>uously crept into the very hearts of several Northern cities and states. The

</p>
<p>American Knights being composed in the outset wholly of men who from experi-
</p>
<p>ence had discovered whatever defectiveness may have been chargeable upon the
</p>
<p>Golden Circle, it was sought in the new Order to remedy the evils of the old
</p>
<p>Order.
</p>
<p>With this in view, looking over the former and later phases of the Golden
</p>
<p>Circle as it had existed in the North and South, respectively, it was agreed to give
</p>
<p>the new Order still another capacity, and what was called the military branch or
</p>
<p>department was added, the incendiary capacity of the old Order being merged
</p>
<p>into this new military department.
</p>
<p>16 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>We have seen that there had been in the North an Order mainly of educational
</p>
<p>capacity, contemplating revolution so soon as the public mind could be put in
</p>
<p>readiness for such an event, but now for the first time we find an Order prepared
</p>
<p>in its organic structure, to speedily collect together the elements of revolution and
</p>
<p>set them in motion. Such a concern was the Order of American Knights. True,
</p>
<p>the rise of the Order created a momentary excitement in political circles, as yet
</p>
<p>unaccustomed to dealing with the stern problems of Northern revolution by resort
</p>
<p>to arms. But, by the admirable adjustment of the administrative powers of the
</p>
<p>Order, into degrees, sub-degrees and departments of degrees and sub-degrees, the
</p>
<p>leaders were enabled to give to each adventurer in quest of the hidden mysteries
</p>
<p>of the so-called impartial maxims of genuine Democracy  that Democracy which
</p>
<p>boasts of having 'permeated through every fibre and artery of our political, com-
</p>
<p>mercial and social systems, a comfortable and genial sphere in which he was left
</p>
<p>to operate upon his good behavior.
</p>
<p>Upon this ingenious plan the vast body and mass of the Order simply held the
</p>
<p>relation of probationary membership, until they were rendered competent through
</p>
<p>the educational capacity of the society, to advance into full fellowship with its
</p>
<p>diabolical design. A glance at this organization will suffice to show the shrewd-
</p>
<p>ness of the transient and local agents of the Confederacy, in their formation of an
</p>
<p>Order, having for its mission the attainment of so many incidental objects, without
</p>
<p>in the meantime subjecting themselves to the dangers of collission in their
</p>
<p>machinery. Accordingly, the Order was composed of three general degrees, viz. :
</p>
<p>First, the Temple Degree, second, the Grand Council Degree, and third, the
</p>
<p>Supreme Council Degree.
</p>
<p>The first or Temple Degree, resembled the county organization of a State, and
</p>
<p>held the same relation to the second or Grand Council Degree (which was the
</p>
<p>state organization of the Order,) that our county government holds to our State
</p>
<p>government, and it was always sought to establish this first or Temple Degree at
</p>
<p>each county seat in a State, as expeditiously as possible, that the second or Grand_
</p>
<p>Council Degree could the sooner be fully represented, and begin its State manage
</p>
<p>ment of the Order. In other chapters the writer has made a passing, though
</p>
<p>sufficient allusion to the internal workings of these Temples, and doubtless the
</p>
<p>initiated reader, in different sections, will recognize the facts we have already and

</p>
<p>posed to have subscribed to, not to reveal the existence of the Order and its
</p>
<p>secrets, under penalty of u suffering a shameful death."
</p>
<p>The process usually followed in instituting the Temple Degree, was to send
</p>

</p>
<p>the contrary, it was everywhere received by the politicians, both great and small,
</p>
<p>as "Just the thing they had been looking for." These politicians were then left
</p>
<p>to " manage their own local affairs " concerning the Order, " subject only to the
</p>
<p>constitution " of Jeff. Davis. Generally, several meetings and some discussion
</p>
<p>enabled these empyrics to determine plans of strategy to screen themselves, by
</p>
<p>H covering the tracks in the sand," a remark frequently heard from members.
</p>
<p>The plan in most cases adopted, was to familiarize a sufficient number of the
</p>
<p>elect, with a grossly immoral and treasonable pamphlet, called the " Kitual of the
</p>
<p>Order," to enable them to officer the Temple, and " induct " any number of
</p>
<p>u candidates " supposed to be " in waiting in the ante-room, into the sublime,"
</p>
<p>but in fact dark and dubious " mysteries of the Order."
</p>
<p>After one or more squads of these " candidates in " anxious and breathless
</p>
<p>* waiting " had been inducted, (meanwhile staring like stuck pigs at every object
</p>
<p>and officer which met their eyes,) in addition to the regular officers of the Temple
</p>
<p>already installed, it was considered that enough official and canvassing material
</p>
<p>had been acquired, and the more prominent politicians, not officers of the Temple,
</p>
<p>deemed it prudent to absent themselves from most of the weekly meetings.
</p>
<p>Again, it was an illusion of these leaders, to put forward the most irresponsible
</p>
<p>persons at their command, as the mouth-pieces and official representatives of the
</p>
<p>Order, to the end that if detected, the theory of crazy, poicerless fools, could be
</p>
<p>wielded upon public sentiment by an undisturbed partisan press, to save the
</p>
<p>scheme from thorough investigation and development by the authorities.
</p>
<p>In evidence of the fact of these illusions, L. A. Doolittle lectures the Temple
</p>
<p>in Chicago on the " purposes and plans of the Order," (but who by the way, was
</p>
<p>not so " insane on the subject " as the men who put him forward have sought to
</p>
<p>show him to be,) and prominent politicians, not before known to be members of
</p>
<p>the fraternity, appear prior to semi-annual elections as candidates for representa-
</p>
<p>tives in the Grand Council.
</p>
<p>It was duly announced, also, that an extra session of the Supreme Council had
</p>
<p>been convened in the city of New York, charged with the special business of
</p>
<p>revising the ritual, changing the signs, passwords, grips, and giving to the Order a'
</p>
<p>new name. Pursuant to announcement, Charles TV. Patten made his appearance-
</p>
<p>in the Temple with the rituals and paraphernalia of the new Order of the Sons of

<p>Liberty  the result of the proceedings of the late Supreme Council.
</p>
<p>This obscure individual, with fame limited to the dusty walls of the Invincible
</p>
<p>Club Rooms and the traitor's dungeon at Camp Douglas, upon his appearance in
</p>
<p>the Temple, assigned two chief reasons for the recent action of the Supreme Council
</p>
<p>First and most important was, the obvious inadequacy of the Order of American
</p>
<p>Knights to subserve the purpose for which it was instituted, in consequence
</p>
<p>of the subordination of the military to the civil department. And, second, the
</p>
<p>disclosure in St. Louis had rendered the Order liable to intrusion by spies, ar,
</p>
<p>embarrassment to be avoided only by alteration of signs, grips, passwords, anc
</p>
<p>name. TVe were then informed that we were Sons of Liberty (a sensible marj

<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 19
</p>
<p>would Lave said sons of the devil, if he had dared to have spoken the truth), and
</p>
<p>earnestly exhorted to exercise the utmost caution in adhering to the new rules and
</p>
<p>instructions of the Supreme Council. It is not a little amusing to witness the
</p>
<p>homoepathic doses of modern democracy, carefully administered to the rank and
</p>
<p>file of the northern people through the medium of these Orders.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the Golden Circle edifies the " stranger advancing in dark,
</p>
<p>devious ways" with lessons upon the doctrine of state sovereignty, and admon-
</p>
<p>ishes him to " follow the straight and narrow path which is paved with gems and
</p>
<p>pearls, and bordered with perennial flowers whose perfumes all his senses will
</p>
<p>entrance," all of which is received by the sincere candidate with every mark of
</p>
<p>approval. "We next find the American Knights embracing its members in the
</p>
<p>bedazzling folds of military lace to be used when in arms against the Government.
</p>
<p>A splendid spectacle of the doctrines of Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and
</p>
<p>Douglas ! And to cap the miserable climax, men boasting of the Democracy of
</p>
<p>their fathers in a line of lineal descent for generations back, are required to sub-
</p>
<p>scribe to the doctrine of the subordination of the civil to the military authority by
</p>
<p>the tenets of the Sons of Liberty.
</p>
<p>This astonishing feature of the Sons of Liberty, as contradistinguished from the
</p>
<p>Orders which preceded it, at first met with murmurs of disfavor, but the dissatis-
</p>
<p>faction was principally among men who ultimately acted the nobler part, and as
</p>
<p>the tide of treason rolled up to sustain this measure " for the good of the Order,"
</p>
<p>all such were submerged and lost sight of, except by the evil eye set upon them
</p>
<p>as spies.
</p>
<p>Without offering his advice, the writer would respectfully ask the true Democrat,
</p>
<p>who may yet, from the temptations of firmly-rooted prejudices, incline to the belief
</p>
<p>that this organization was purely democratic in the Andrew Jackson acceptation
</p>
<p>of that term, how the above statement of principles comports with his notions
</p>
<p>of the doctrines of the party with which he has hitherto seen fit to fellowship ?
</p>
<p>Is it not clearly to be seen that this Order meditated the establishment of a
</p>
<p>government more despotic in its character than history furnishes any example of?
</p>
<p>A government with three degrees or departments, each oath-bound and a profound
</p>
<p>secret to the other, moving in their appointed spheres, and the civil departments
</p>
<p>of which were secondary, in point of power, to the military departments !

<p>Let no man, of whatever political persuasion he may be, flatter himself for a

<p>Having now traced, with perhaps a tedious hand, the rise and fall of two polit-

<p>Doolittles were put forward because they were eager for the fray, and possessed
</p>
<p>the temerity to brave the danger of Union bullets.
</p>
<p>We have now seen how the Temple or First Degree was instituted in counties ;
</p>
<p>how the various elements of treason were collected together and detailed for their
</p>
<p>special service of educating the ignorant, manufacturing materials and munitions
</p>
<p>of war, and devising plots to burn, plunder, and pillage unsuspecting cities ; how
</p>
<p>each member was singled out according to his fitoess for certain duties, which he
</p>
<p>performed without their character coming even to his fellow members of the same
</p>
<p>degree ; and how the brained leaders of these institutions retired to the back
</p>
<p>ground to elude the vigilance of the ministers of the law, and " adjust the wires"
</p>
<p>that were to check to-day, and to-morrow precipitate the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The Grand Council, or Second Degree, was established in every State where the
</p>
<p>Temple Degree had obtained any strength and character as to numbers. This I
</p>
<p>Degree resembled the State in its governmental organization, and bore the same 
</p>
<p>relation to the Supreme Council or Third Degree that the State governments of
</p>
<p>the Federal Union bear to the government at Washington. The Order having a
</p>
<p>military department, these Grand Councils, in council assembled, adopted the
</p>
<p>militia and other statute laws of the particular State, with such revisions, excep-
</p>
<p>tions and additional laws as were deemed essential to the successful operation of I
</p>
<p>the Order.
</p>
<p>Regular semi-annual meetings of the Grand Councils were held, convening
</p>
<p>respectively on the 22d of August and the 22d of February  the latter, in sacri-
</p>
<p>lege be it said, being religiously observed as the birthday of Washington.
</p>
<p>But extra sessions were almost monthly called during the year of 1864, prior
</p>
<p>to the election, to take precautionary and other expedient action upon the con-
</p>
<p>tinually recurring changes of that eventful year. No considerable battle was
</p>
<p>fought in the front, that was not the signal for the assembling of this council,
</p>
<p>and no political event of any importance transpired that did not receive the solemn
</p>
<p>deliberations of this already de Jacto legislative body. Of course no person ever
</p>
<p>became a member of this Council who had not first been inducted into the Temple,
</p>
<p>and then by his Temple elected as a representative in the Grand Council, the
</p>
<p>election for which purpose was held semi-annually as above, and new representa-
</p>
<p>tives took their seats at each regular session.

<p>The Grand Council embraced in its sphere of labors such duties as experience

<p>tempered with prudence, was destined to bring to the light of day this infernal

</p>
<p>Commander of the Sons of Liberty.
</p>
<p>A new era in the history of secret political orders was opened by the Sons of
</p>
<p>Liberty.
</p>
<p>As the Presidential election of 1864 approached, the party in the minority
</p>
<p>began to appreciate the awkwardness of its attitude upon the political issues of
</p>
<p>the day, and appeared determined in its conclusion to obtain the ascendency in the
</p>
<p>coming administration, by means of fraud and force.
</p>
<p>The great mass of the party had now become conversant and familiar with every
</p>
<p>species of political crime, through secret organization, and it only remained for
</p>
<p>the leaders to decide upon a programme, to have it executed with despatch and
</p>
<p>fidelity.
</p>
<p>Languishing under the lash of chastisement inflicted npon those infamous
</p>
<p>enough to aid and abet the cause of dismemberment, mutual hate and slaughter,
</p>
<p>National extinction and death, they swore in this Order an eternal and most dread-
</p>
<p>ful oath of vengeance upon their offenders, and pledged themselves, under fearful
</p>
<p>penalties of death, " ever to take up arms in the cause of the oppressed in their
</p>
<p>own country, first of all, against any monarch, prince, potentate, power or govern-
</p>
<p>ment usurped, and found in arms and waging war against a people or peoples, who
</p>
<p>had of their own free choice, inaugurated a government for themselves, in accord-
</p>
<p>ance with and founded upon the eternal principles of truth."
</p>
<p>Thus, the lovliest form of ancient or modern civilization, in a republic justt
</p>
<p>rising to the glories of empire, was to be sacrificed to the mad notion of petty
</p>
<p>" State Sovereignty," by a sworn band of depcradoes. How sad when other
</p>
<p>generations would ask, where is the Federal Government, to be answered only by
</p>
<p>poets, who would sing her elegy, as in the past they have sang that of the lamented:
</p>
<p>Hellas :
</p>
<p>"Ask the Paynim slave,
</p>
<p>Who treads all tearless on her hallowed grave ;

<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 23
</p>
<p>Lo ! from a thousand crumbling tombs they rise 
</p>
<p>The great of old, the powerful and the wise !
</p>
<p>And a sad tale which none but they can tell,
</p>
<p>Falls on the mournful silence like a knell.
</p>
<p>Then mark yon lonely pilgrim bend and weep
</p>
<p>Above the mound where genius lies in sleep.
</p>
<p>And is this all? Alas ! we turn in vain,
</p>
<p>And, turning, meet the self-same waste again 
</p>
<p>The same drear wilderness of stern decay ;
</p>
<p>Its former pride, the phantom of a day ;
</p>
<p>A song of summer-birds within a bower ;
</p>
<p>A dream of beauty traced upon a flower ;
</p>
<p>A lute whose master-chord has ceased to sound ;
</p>
<p>A morning-star struck darkling to the ground."
</p>
<p>The thought of the miserable commentary stirs the ire of the patriot and nerves
</p>
<p>his arm to daring deeds, in the holy cause of liberty, the constitution, and his
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>Skulk back into your dark dens of iniquity, you Clement L. Vallandigham, and
</p>
<p>you James A. McMaster, and you S. Corning Judd, and you Amos Green, and
</p>
<p>you P. C Wright, (in Fort Lafayette 'where you ought to be,) before the wrath of
</p>
<p>honest people falls upon your wicked heads ! Each of you, with the exception of
</p>
<p>you, Wright, being too infamous for that, even, have been before the Commission
</p>
<p>at Cincinnati, and stand before an outraged people condemned out of your own
</p>
<p>lips ! Dare insult the light of day with your hideous faces, and be dashed in
</p>
<p>pieces on the rocks of public scorn !
</p>
<p>But to return to our text, the Sons of Liberty, we find that undaunted organ-
</p>
<p>ization in full blast from the time of its official inception in New York up to the
</p>
<p>Monday morning of the arrests on the 7th of November last.
</p>
<p>It is now proposed to show, by an allusion to certain prominent facts occurring
</p>
<p>during the summer of '64, that the so-called Democratic party was the main-
</p>
<p>spring to the great conspiracy that has been attempted in the North with so
</p>
<p>much audacity that many men of the best judgment can scarcely believe it to be
</p>
<p>a reality. In this we do not wish to be understood that all men who have here-

<p>tofore voted the " unterrified " ticket, have knowingly and -willingly given aid
</p>
<p>and comfort to the treasonable plans and purposes of their leaders, for our personal
</p>
<p>acquaintance among that class of anti-administration men, is sufficient to enable us
</p>
<p>to say, with confidence, that many of them are as loyal at heart as any man who
</p>
<p>ever breathed the air of an American freeman.
</p>
<p>But we mean this, and proclaim the fact in the face of every foe, that upon the
</p>
<p>death of that lamented statesman and patriot, Stephen A. Douglas, the Woods
</p>
<p>and McMasters of New York, the Seymours of Connecticut, the Vallandighams
</p>
<p>and Pendletons of Ohio, the Voorhees and Dodds of Indiana, the Judds and
</p>
<p>Greens of Illinois, and others of like ilk in other States, obtained the chieftainship
</p>
<p>of the party and inveigled its too pliable ranks into the prostituting embrace of
</p>
<p>this foul conspiracy, to overthrow the government and crown with success the cause
</p>
<p>of the confederate arms. It must be readily seen by every honest man of ordinary
</p>
<p>intelligence, that such an affair could never have gained a foothold among our
</p>
<p>24 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>people under a truly loyal condition of the opposing party. The truthfulness of
</p>
<p>this assertion is so very forcible to the candid reader, that illustration or argument
</p>
<p>in support of it would be superfluous. However, occasional incidents will serve
</p>
<p>better to connect popular leaders with the subject of these sketches, and call to
</p>
<p>the minds of participants practical facts.
</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. Charles Walsh, some time during the winter of '64 and '65, received
</p>
<p>his quantum of a fund, of which we shall hereafter speak, to purchase arms to be
</p>
<p>distributed in the 1st Congressional district of Illinois, comprising the county of
</p>
<p>Cook, and the scene of the late Chicago conspiracy, the enactment of which was
</p>
<p>to be the signal for a general conflagration uf our cities, and thus fulfil the prophecy
</p>
<p>of Jeff. Davis, that the grass would grow again, on the streets of the cities of the
</p>
<p>North.
</p>
<p>Do the leaders of the Invincible Club, among whom are W. C Goudy, John
</p>
<p>Garrick, Malcom McDonald, and Dr. Swayne Wickersharu, remember that that
</p>
<p>institution was to be the public mouth-piece of the Sons of Liberty, in an address
</p>
<p>to the Democracy of Chicago, to have been issued during the Presidential cam-
</p>
<p>paign ?
</p>
<p>Do they also remember the joint delegation of Invincibles and Sons of Liberty
</p>
<p>that received Vallandigham and the Woods of New York, on their arrival in
</p>
<p>Chicago to participate in, and mould the proceedings of the National Democratic
</p>
<p>Convention ?
</p>
<p>Do they further remember the remarkable speech made in their Hall during
</p>
<p>the Convention, by Capt. Rynders of New York, whom they hissed from the
</p>
<p>platform for his bold and fearless expression oi loyal sentiments ?
</p>
<p>Do they remember the motto, " Never worship the setting sun," which appeared
</p>
<p>on transparencies, and frequently fell from their own lips, and was meant as a hit
</p>
<p>upon those who were supposed to have allied themselves with treason, because of
</p>
<p>their belief in its eventual success ?
</p>
<p>Do they remember how it was proposed that Charles Walsh, of the Sons of
</p>
<p>Liberty, was to negotiate a purchase of the Chicago Post, and convert it to the
</p>
<p>same villainous purpose of its cotemporary, the Times ?
</p>
<p>Have they forgotten the fifty or sixty thousand dollars raised by subscription to
</p>
<p>the books of the Club, nominally to be used for procession and illuminating pur-

<p>poses, but which was used for the purchase of arms and the importation of butter-
</p>
<p>nuts, to engage in the attack upon Camp Douglas ?
</p>
<p>Have they forgotten that large sums of this money was obtained under false
</p>
<p>pretences  under pretences that it was to be used for ordinary campaign purposes ?
</p>
<p>Have they forgotten that through their instrumentality the McClellan Escorts,
</p>
<p>then organized in every ward, were officered by Sons of Liberty ?
</p>
<p>Have they forgotten the meeting of Invincible Club members and Sons of
</p>
<p>Liberty in the sanctum sanctorum of the Chicago Times, where the question of
</p>
<p>punishing Col. R. M. Hough and Mr. Eddy, in redress of personal injuries alleged
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 25
</p>
<p>to have been inflicted upon Wilbur F. Story, was gravely discussed by B. G.
</p>
<p>CaulfieM, 0. J. Rose, Alderman Barrett, S. Remington and others, and where
</p>
<p>also, large numbers of muskets and smaller arms were exhibited ?
</p>
<p>And lastly, have they forgotten that the Sons of Liberty, upon a certain occa-
</p>
<p>sion well known to every Copperhead member of the last Common Council of the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago, held themselves in readiness till after midnight, expecting to be
</p>
<p>called to the assistance of that, at that time, treasonable body ?
</p>
<p>None know the significance of these questions better than the persons above
</p>
<p>mentioned, and others who were on hand about those times. The merchants of
</p>
<p>South Water street in Chicago can now, perhaps, explain why they were called
</p>
<p>upon to subscribe so heavily to the books of the Invincible Club, and the writer-
</p>
<p>would suggest the propriety of these merchants compelling those who solicited
</p>
<p>these subscriptions, to deliver up the arms so purchased, or refund the money
</p>
<p>to its rightful owners.
</p>
<p>It is pretty well understood, we believe, that the Bridgeport Irish, vote the
</p>
<p>u straight ticket/' It is said, also, that James Geary, a Son of Liberty and "old
</p>
<p>clothes man " on the corner of Wells and Madison streets, could " influence hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of them by the wave of his hand." Now this "old clothes man" was em-
</p>
<p>powered to furnish food, raiment and shelter to all escaped rebel prisoners, and
</p>
<p>charge the same to the Sons of Liberty, alias the Invincible Club, which, it is
</p>
<p>thought, sometimes paid such hills out of South Water street money subscribed
</p>
<p>for processions and illuminations. These facts are the keys to the revenue plan
</p>
<p>of the Sons of Liberty.
</p>
<p>The complicity of the " straight ticket" voters in this scheme is further shown
</p>
<p>by the character of their State ticket, headed by Robinson for Governor, Judd
</p>
<p>for Lieut. Governor, and Hise of La Salle for Auditor, each Sons of Liberty, and
</p>
<p>Judd the Grand Commander of the State. If, as it would be made to appear,
</p>
<p>there was no complicity between the Democracy and the Confederate agents, why
</p>
<p>did Vallandigham, the Supreme Commander of an Order having its inception in
</p>
<p>Richmond, address the people from every stump in Illinois ? If there was no
</p>
<p>complicity, why did Vallandigham, on his return from exile, in his official capa-
</p>
<p>city, with his staff around him, defy the United States government that had justly
</p>
<p>banished him  with 80,000 Ohioans at his command ?

<p>If no complicity, why did all the rebels and confederate agents in Canada come
</p>
<p>to the Chicago Convention, and why were they here again at the November elec-

<p>NSIDE view of a Lodge of the Sons of Liberty in Chicago

</p>
<p>Rebel victories  The Great Peoria Peace meeting  Whiskey,
</p>
<p>treason and gunpowder.
</p>
<p>Prior to July 1864, the information of the public or the authorities, in
</p>
<p>respect to the aims, intents and objects of the organized bands of home traitors,
</p>
<p>was very meagre and indefinite, for it was no easy task for detectives or loyal
</p>
<p>citizens to enter the portals of the Temples. True, enough had transpired at the
</p>
<p>investigations, and before military commissions in different sections of the country,
</p>
<p>to awaken a painful interest and unceasing vigilance on the part of loyal men.
</p>
<p>So well were these organizations guarded, that vigilance committees of their mem-
</p>
<p>bers were appointed with imperative instructions to report the names of all civic
</p>
<p>officers and detectives in the employment of the United States and Provost Mar-
</p>
<p>shals, and all persons, by whomsoever employed, who should attempt to obtain the
</p>
<p>secrets of the Order. So complete was the organization, that lists of names were
</p>
<p>reported and read at the weekly meetings, and the following day the names and
</p>
<p>descriptions of such officers were thoroughly circulated and reported to the
</p>
<p>brethren in other cities and towns, and as well might a belled cat hope to invade
</p>
<p>the precincts of rats and attain success, as for such a " spotted " individual to
</p>
<p>gain access to the Temples of American Knights and Sons of Liberty. Not a
</p>
<p>change was made on the police, not an increase or decrease of Provost guards,
</p>
<p>not a change of even the location of artillery in Camp Douglas, no change, how-
</p>
<p>ever minute of interest to the rebels, was made but that it was reported and dis-
</p>
<p>cussed within these nests and dens of treason.
</p>
<p>It was atempted on several occasions by parties of loyal men, to ferret out and
</p>
<p>secure the secrets of the Order, but as well might an attempt have been made to
</p>
<p>possess the secrets of the Council of Ten, by the officers of the governments of
</p>
<p>Europe; it was almost impossible, and yet the developments upon the recent trials
</p>
<p>show conclusively, that had the task not been effected, the most terrible results
</p>
<p>would have ensued. With the desire to aid the Government to the extent of indi-
</p>
<p>vidual ability, it was not strange that when opportunity occurred, whereby all
</p>
<p>might be known, and that knowledge applied to the benefit of our bleeding
</p>
<p>country, that any loyal man would have availed himself of it, at any hazard.

<p>The writer found such opportunity, and waiving all personal considerations,
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 27
</p>
<p>undertook the task, trusting in God for success, and conscious that all good men would
</p>
<p>approve the motive, and that if for a time, reproach and calumny should cloud his
</p>
<p>reputation, or if perchance the assassin's hand should execute the sworn purpose
</p>
<p>of the Order, as the penalty for surrendering them to the hands of our Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, the time would surely come when the motives and the acts would find that
</p>
<p>approval in the hearts of all honest men, as it did in his own. Confiding the
</p>
<p>information accidentally obtained to W. H. Rand, Esq., of Chicago, a gentleman
</p>
<p>whose patriotism and whose reputation needs no encomiums, he immediately
</p>
<p>advised the expediency of conference with the State Executive, and to the honor
</p>
<p>of Governor Richard Yates, it should be said, he fully realized the importance of
</p>
<p>acquiring reliable information of the plots of the secret ally of Jeff. Davis. By
</p>
<p>Governor Yates an introduction was given to Brig.-Gen. Paine, then in command
</p>
<p>of the department, and again full and unqualified approval of the course thus far
</p>
<p>taken, was expressed, with the urgent request to follow up every avenue of infor-
</p>
<p>mation in this direction. Gen. Paine issued an introduction to Col. B. J. Sweet,
</p>
<p>whom he declared to be a " model man and a model officer in every respect," and
</p>
<p>in whom all confidence in so commendable a cause might be reposed. How nobly,
</p>
<p>how wisely and how well that gallant officer discharged his trust, all who have
</p>
<p>observed his course will concede, and that man whose heriosm at the memorable
</p>
<p>battle of Perryville, and on other battle fields, will ever be held in grateful remem-
</p>
<p>brance by his countrymen, has added new lustre to his name, and the hearty
</p>
<p>benedictions which will ever be invoked for the defender of Chicago  the noble
</p>
<p>Col. Sweet  attest the satisfaction and joy of the people, to know that his services
</p>
<p>in this most difficult and hazardous undertaking are appreciated by the General
</p>
<p>Government, and the star upon his shoulder will glitter brighter as time wears on,
</p>
<p>and Copperheads live only in history, an evidence of how low men may sink in
</p>
<p>the scale of morality, and a warning to all future time.
</p>
<p>For the writer to bave hesitated in a course of duty so plain, and yet so distaste-
</p>
<p>ful, would have been criminal, cowardly, and unworthy of an American citizen.
</p>
<p>The advantage gained was followed up unremittingly, by day and by night, for
</p>
<p>many weary months, regardless of all professional duties and personal considera-
</p>
<p>tions. It was at the outset found highly necessary, if not indispensable, to have
</p>
<p>the concurrence of one good, loyal man of marked qualification  one who was

</p>
<p>discreet, who had experience upon police duties, who was prompt, energetic, per-
</p>
<p>severing, patient, fearless, and withal a strictly honest man, a citizen whose reputa-
</p>
<p>tion was above reproach ; that man was found ; he was Robert Alexander. After
</p>
<p>brief consideration, Mr. Alexander gave to the writer his hearty and earnest
</p>
<p>concurrence. Nothing was left undone by him that could further the hazardous
</p>
<p>undertaking, and personal gratitude for his ready acquiescence, which we tender
</p>
<p>to him, will meet with a ready response in the hearts of all good citizens.
</p>
<p>It is now Thursday evening in July 1864. We will now ask the reader to go
</p>
<p>again with us up those long, tedious flights of stairs to the outer rooms of the
</p>
<p>" temple" of the Sons of Liberty in Chicago. We left the room before with the
</p>
<p>-O THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>remembrance of only a hole six inches in diameter for a full sized Copperhead to
</p>
<p>crawl through, but we shall have better success this time. Advancing to the
</p>
<p>aforesaid door, and giving three distinct raps, the slide, which we find covers the
</p>
<p>hole from the inside, is moved up, and a live, full-grown Copperhead peers through
</p>
<p>the orifice. We whisper the word " Peace," or " Peoria," or whatever the monthly
</p>
<p>pass-word is, and the door is open, and we find ourselves within the vestibule of
</p>
<p>the temple, surrounded by a little group going through the preliminary exercises
</p>
<p>of initiation. We see the candidate and sponsors, with hands uplifted, and listen
</p>
<p>to the very poor reading of an officer, from the ritual, and giving the new comer
</p>
<p>his first dose of States' sovereignty and secession. This is so mystified and clouded
</p>
<p>with high-sounding words that the poor devil nods at every time the reader stops
</p>
<p>for breath, or to expectorate tobacco juice, and the ceremony is concluded, and the
</p>
<p>candidate, respectable for the good clothes which he wears this night as a rarity,
</p>
<p>follows his conductor to another door, where he hopes for admission, tbe only im-
</p>
<p>pression on the candidate being, that his right arm is weary from being elevated
</p>
<p>so long, and that he is coming rapidly into good fellowship with men of high
</p>
<p>judicial standing, who propose to give Abolitionists and Lincoln particular " hell
</p>
<p>under the shirt tail."
</p>
<p>Again they knock and are challenged by an inside guardian, who lectures the
</p>
<p>newly fledged Son, who having nodded sufficiently, is conducted to the Ancient
</p>
<p>Brother in the West, so that the Son, reversing the order of nature, begins rising
</p>
<p>in the West. The " Ancient Brother" is a better reader, for here we find brains
</p>
<p>for the first time, as it is the leaders, as we have already said, who do all the
</p>
<p>thinking, unless, perchance, the simple wretches find themselves in Camp Douglas,
</p>
<p>where they begin thinking for themselves. While the Ancient Brother is reading
</p>
<p>to the attentive comer, now happy in the thought that he has taken himself in out
</p>
<p>of the draft, let us survey the sanctum sanctorum ; but first let us advance to the
</p>
<p>centre of the hall, where we find a piece of dirty oil cloth the size of a door mat,
</p>
<p>and stepping upon this, with body erect and turning our back upon the Ancient
</p>
<p>Brother, we find ourselves facing the Grand Seignior, who, on our first introduc-
</p>
<p>tion, is Judge Morris ; we salute, which we do by applying the palm of our right
</p>
<p>hand to the lips, then turning the hand to his seigniorship and bringing our left
</p>
<p>hand across the breast, which salutation being returned by the Grand Seignior,

<p>who sits upon a raised platform and wields a gavel, we take seats wherever our
</p>
<p>sense of cleanliness will permit, and where we hope there may be no traveling
</p>
<p>minute messengers conveying ideas from one man's head to another.
</p>
<p>On the north side of the room is another platform and desk, where a guardian
</p>
<p>sits and addresses the candidate, who is supposed to lose his way and to be set
</p>
<p>right by this guardian, and even if the candidate is thoroughly sober he may be
</p>
<p>excused for losing his way, for it is a matter of much doubt whether he was ever
</p>
<p>in such a labarynth of words as he has just heard from the Ancient Brother, who,
</p>
<p>having given the man some pretty strong obligations, to endorse and support the
</p>
<p>policy of Jeff. Davis, together with an intimation that if he ever exposes any of the
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 29
</p>
<p>secrets, lie may expect to suffer all sorts of penalties, and told him to fancy lie had
</p>
<p>just received an acorn, the emblem of the order  he now sits down quietly in the
</p>
<p>pleasant consciousness that " we have got one more good voter on our side." The
</p>
<p>guardian of the North having put the new Son on his way, he appears in the East,
</p>
<p>reflecting his effulgence all around. The Grand Seignior now rises from his seat,
</p>
<p>drops his gavel and explains the mysteries of the initiation, giving him another
</p>
<p>dose of secession, about as much as the poor fellow can carry; tells him how to
</p>
<p>challenge a brother, concluding by giving the grand sign of distress, which is by
</p>
<p>raising the right hand and calling out " Ocoon " three times, which he says is
</p>
<p>made up of the name of Calhoun, whose name is mentioned with great reverence.
</p>
<p>Thus closes the ceremony of initiation. " Considerations for the good of the
</p>
<p>Order " being the next order of business, speeches are made by some of the older
</p>
<p>heads to make the new one feel at home. This " feast of reason and flow of soul"
</p>
<p>over, other business is transacted, and the temple is closed, the Grand Scignor
</p>
<p>occasionally expressing a few words of caution, saying that but few members must
</p>
<p>be present at the meetings at this hall, as the presence of too great numbers will
</p>
<p>excite suspicion and lead to arrest. The next weekly meeting similar events
</p>
<p>occur, but new faces appear at every meeting, that is to say, the greater number
</p>
<p>of members who were present last week are absent this week, and others take their
</p>
<p>places. The Chicago Times, however, is well represented at most of the important
</p>
<p>meetings. There were about two thousand members of the Sons of Liberty in
</p>
<p>"good and regular standing" in Chicago alone, at the time they were let down.
</p>
<p>By careful arrangements we were able to have reports from the different temples
</p>
<p>throughout the most important points in the Northwest, and carefully noted the
</p>
<p>chief business and obtained the list of members, all of which has been as carefully
</p>
<p>placed in the hands of the authorities of the War Department, and months ago
</p>
<p>much of the information was imparted to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, in command
</p>
<p>of the Northern Department, who was pleased to express his highest appreciation
</p>
<p>of the services rendered, and a desire to have the investigation thoroughly made,
</p>
<p>that indisputable facts might be obtained, that truth and justice might be promoted
</p>
<p>and the interest of the country thereby protected. So thorough and searching has
</p>
<p>been the investigation that every man of any note in this order, in almost every
</p>
<p>locality where this moral cancer has existed, is known and may consider himself in

<p>future upon his good behavior.
</p>
<p>It was the policy of the Sons of Liberty, which they observed as far as it was
</p>
<p>possible for them to do, to obtain positions of trust in the army, upon the police,
</p>
<p>in the courts, in railway offices and telegraph stations, in the office of Provost
</p>
<p>Marshals, post-offices, departments of government, both local and general, indeed,
</p>
<p>so completely did they carry out this plan, that they made their boasts that they
</p>
<p>were represented upon all the railroads running out of Chicago, and it was not an
</p>
<p>unusual thing for them to report matters of the various departments just mentioned.
</p>
<p>One member of the Chicago Order, as appeared in evidence before the military
</p>
<p>commission, traveled over the North wherever he desired, on the pass of a Provost
</p>
<p>30 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Marshal in Indiana, his business being to aid in the organization of Temples in
</p>
<p>the different sections of the West. So rapidly did they increase in numbers, that
</p>
<p>Judge Morris estimated the number in Illinois alone at 80,000 members.
</p>
<p>It was a rule of the organization, that its members should all be well armed
</p>
<p>and skilled in the use of weapons. The rapidity of increase in numbers, rendered
</p>
<p>them conscious of their strength, and they became openly defiant and talked
</p>
<p>treason upon the corners of our streets, and wherever little groups of people
</p>
<p>assembled. The mob spirit was excited, and all were ready for mischief whenever
</p>
<p>opportunity offered ; and while all were bound to wait submissively till their leaders
</p>
<p>should give the signal for revolution, still many were restless and impatient for the
</p>
<p>hour to come, and hoped that they would not long have to wait. The suppression
</p>
<p>of the Chicago Times was an auspicious moment for them, and they made capital
</p>
<p>of it. They were never tired of talking of Vallandigham, and while that worthy
</p>
<p>Btaid in Canada he was very serviceable to the Order, as John Rogers was of more
</p>
<p>service to the church dead than while living. Vallandigham made an excellent
</p>
<p>martyr and an accomplished exile, but as an active member at home, old Doolittle,
</p>
<p>or Charles W. Patten, or James A. Wilkinson, or J. L. Rock, or Obadiah Jackson,
</p>
<p>Jr., Esq., or even Mrs. Morris herself, was worth two just like him. Why he
</p>
<p>could not have staid in Canada for the good of the cause, we cannot understand.
</p>
<p>What a Mecca was Windsor, and how great was Mahomet, but alas, when the
</p>
<p>great, the Hon. Clement Vallandigham relapsed into the three-cent fourth-class
</p>
<p>lawyer, in the little one horse city of Dayton, " what a fall was there my country-
</p>
<p>men." No more pilgrimages, no more dinners with the great exile, no more texts
</p>
<p>of " arbitary arrests " to preach from, that could draw as Val used to draw.
</p>
<p>The reception of the news of a victory by the rebels, was always an occasion of
</p>
<p>rejoicing among the Sons and Knights, and in the exuberance of their joy they
</p>
<p>shouted their treason in all sorts of places, and at all seasons. They assumed to
</p>
<p>be peace men, and yet were always ready for a quarrel. It became evident to all
</p>
<p>who kept posted in politics, that there would be a wide division between the differ-
</p>
<p>ent wings of the Democracy at the coming National Convention, and a most deter-
</p>
<p>mined effort was to be made by the Peace faction, to control the action of the
</p>
<p>Convention, and long before the assembling of that body, newspaper strife had
</p>
<p>commenced between them, and it was hoped, and so it proved, that like the Kil-

</p>
<p>kenny cats, they devoured each other. With Peace in their mouths and conten-
</p>
<p>tion in their hearts, the " unterrified" resolved upon a great meeting, to be held
</p>
<p>in Peoria. It was a " big thing." The Chicago delegation took for the calumet
</p>
<p>of peace several boxes of fire-arms, so that if opportunity offered they might
</p>
<p>conquer a peace. Whiskey and gunpowder were other elements of that meeting,
</p>
<p>and as the escape of gas in petroleum wells, so noisy for a time, finally subsides,
</p>
<p>so after the ebulition at Peoria, Brig.-Gen. Walsh, and all the Chicago delegates,
</p>
<p>returned home, bringing with them their fire arms, without breaking bulk, and
</p>
<p>these weapons were carefully deposited, where they could instantly be obtained at
</p>
<p>the time of the uprising.

</p>
<p>House, Chicago  Two million dollars disbursed as considera-
</p>
<p>tion FOR THE GOOD OF THE ORDER  TRAITORS TO BE KNOWN TO
</p>
<p>EACn OTHER RY BADGES, AND THEIR PROPERTY SAVED BY DISPLAY-
</p>
<p>ING the Confederate Flag.
</p>
<p>We have already shown that the three degrees in the Sons of Liberty had each
</p>
<p>their specific province. The lower strata composed of the rough material from
</p>
<p>which the Grand Council was made up by selections or choice of the brighter and
</p>
<p>more shining lights,  persons whose political views were up to the standard of
</p>
<p>treason, whose qualifications of intellect, shrewdness, cunning, caution, prompt-
</p>
<p>ness, and firmness of purpose fully met the requirements of this degree of the
</p>
<p>order. The Supreme Council was composed of the Supreme Commanders  the
</p>
<p>ruling spirits of the order. This council was the body, therefore, from which all
</p>
<p>important measures must emanate, and the secrecy of their movements, even from
</p>
<p>the order below them, except such business as was regularly transmitted, was quite
</p>
<p>equal to that of the lower order, from the rest of the world. Such being the
</p>
<p>nature and character of this royal degree, and the fact that an uprising had been
</p>
<p>determined upon, it will be seen how essential it was to the Government of the
</p>
<p>United States, to be advised of their plans, and the the old adage that " where
</p>
<p>there is a will there is a way," was not a fallacy in the present case. On or about
</p>
<p>the 20th of July, 1863, agreeably to a private notice which had been extended to
</p>
<p>the Supreme Council, a meeting of that body was convened at the Richmond
</p>
<p>House, Chicago. During that day, as well as on the day preceding, members of
</p>
<p>that organization arrived in the city, and among the notables present on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion was Col. Barrett, who was a Major-General of the Sons of Liberty, in com-
</p>
<p>mand of the District of Illinois, but who on the present occasion appeared in
</p>
<p>another character of no less moment, that of representative of the Confederate
</p>
<p>States Government, and charged with certain important instructions. Among the
</p>
<p>members present were Captain Majors, from Canada; Brig. -Gen. Charles Walsh,
</p>
<p>of Chicago; Judge Bullitt, of the Supreme Court of Kentucky, who acted as
</p>
<p>Chairman ; Dr. Bowles, Mr. Swan, Mr. Williams, Mr. Green, Mr. Piper, Mr. Hoi

<p>staff. After considerable discussion upon minor matters, Major-General Barrett,
</p>
<p>(commonly called Colonel Barrett, who hid served the Rebel Government with
</p>
<p>6ome distinction, and was a first class rebel), made a formal proposition to unite
</p>
<p>Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio and Indiana with the Confederate States,
</p>
<p>through the agency of the Sons of Liberty, and as to the other States, their rela-
</p>
<p>tions would be an after consideration. The enterprise, he stated, would be attended
</p>
<p>with no little expense, and Would necessarily involve extreme caution, prudence
</p>
<p>and firmness. He added, thal^the Southern Confederacy had placed in his hands
</p>
<p>the snug little sum of two mifiions of dollars, which had been captured from a
</p>
<p>Federal paymaster on the Red River, in Arkansas, to be applied in furtherance of
</p>
<p>this proposition. Captain Majors was also, by his own statement, a representative
</p>
<p>of the Rebel Government. It was proposed to distribute the two millions of dol-
</p>
<p>lars through the Grand Commanders of Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri and
</p>
<p>Illinois, and that the money was by them to be distributed through the Major-
</p>
<p>Generals to the subordinate officers, according as might be deemed expedient. This
</p>
<p>money, says Mr. Wilson, (and we have the best of reasons to credit his statement,)
</p>
<p>was expended for arms.
</p>
<p>Well do we remember that an oral report was submitted one evening at the
</p>
<p>Temple of the Mini, by the Grand Seignor presiding, that the pro rata for Illi-
</p>
<p>nois had been so expended, and that the weapons had been started for their desti-
</p>
<p>nation, which was Chicago. These arms consisted of muskets, carbines, pistols,
</p>
<p>pistol belts and ammunition. At the Council meeting, of which we have spoken,
</p>
<p>the whole subject of revolution was freely discussed, and received the unanimous

<p>support of all present, and a time was named and agreed upon, but not until after
</p>
<p>much debate, several dates being named by different parties, and reasons given
</p>
<p>for fixing upon each. It was arranged that the Order in Indiana were to rendez-
</p>
<p>vous at Indianapolis, also at Evansville, New Albany (opposite Louisville,) and
</p>
<p>Terra Haute, that they would seize the arsenal at Indianapolis, and the arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition would be distributed among the members. Wilson,  before the mili-
</p>
<p>tary commission in Cincinnati, states that he learned from Dr. Bowles, that it was
</p>
<p>the purpose of the Order to free the rebel prisoners at Indianapolis, and that the
</p>
<p>same had been agreed upon with respect to other rebel^camps, in other States, on
</p>
<p>the supposition that they would unite with the Sons of Liberty, in overturning the

</p>
<p>Government, and if they were found willing to do this, arms were to be placed in
</p>
<p>their hands. At that meeting it was a matter of discussion in what manner it
</p>
<p>was feasible to communicate with Gens. Buckner and Price, in order that they
</p>
<p>might co-operate, and have their forces near St. Louis and Louisville. The
</p>
<p>approach of their troops to those cities was the favored moment for beginning
</p>
<p>hostilities in the North. Mr. Wilson testified that he received a thousand dollars
</p>
<p>of tha two million fund, but that instead of appropriating it according to the
</p>
<p>programme, he used it for buying substitutes, but the rightful owner can have
</p>
<p>the same upon call. Maj.-Gen. Barrett, the party having the fund in trust, has
</p>
<p>left the country, doubtless for his health, and the thousand dollars is still without
</p>
<p>an applicant.
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTU-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 33
</p>
<p>At this memorable meeting, as it was the last meeting of this body ever held
</p>
<p>in Chicago, it was agreed that at the time of the uprising, friends (rebels and
</p>
<p>copperheads) should appear with red and white badges, and the property of such
</p>
<p>persons would also be saved from destruction by displaying from their buildings
</p>
<p>the Confederate flag. Thus were ample and definite arrangements made, and as
</p>
<p>that meeting adjourned it was the deliberate end and aim of all the persons there
</p>
<p>assembled (with a single exception) to effect their objects at all hazards. All who
</p>
<p>were present, as well as the rebels then in Richmond, conceded that of all points
</p>
<p>in the several States embraced in the proposition with which Col. Barrett was
</p>
<p>entrusted, Chicago was by far the most important post, and the one which, of all
</p>
<p>others, should first fall. The facility and ease with which Camp Douglas could
</p>
<p>be taken, was a matter of remark among the traitors in every section, and it was
</p>
<p>understood that communication could readily be made with the prisoners, as Mrs.
</p>
<p>Morris, wife of Judge Morris, and others who were known to be in the interest of
</p>
<p>the Confederacy, had never been denied access to the camp, and such prohibition
</p>
<p>was scarcely expected, as of course the plans of the conspirators must be a dead
</p>
<p>secret from the commander of the post. In the temples of the Sons of Liberty it
</p>
<p>was a matter of congratulation that it was impossible for a detective to obtain their
</p>
<p>secrets, yet all this time Col. B. J. Sweet was well acquainted with every move
</p>
<p>that had the least importance, for the writer made it an invariable custom to send
</p>
<p>dispatches regularly to Col. Sweet, who thus came into full possession of the plans
</p>
<p>and designs of the Order, as soon as they were announced, and hence was at all
</p>
<p>times in a position that he could not have been surprised by any assault upon the
</p>
<p>Camp. The Colonel is at all times perfectly cool and self-possessed, prudent in
</p>
<p>the highest degree, and inflexible in purpose, when once resolved upon a line of
</p>
<p>action. His arrangements were made with all celerity and completeness, and
</p>
<p>though his little force was quite too small to offer great resistance in case of sur-
</p>
<p>prise had not the facts been known to the commandant, yet the interior arrange-
</p>
<p>ment of the camp, the disposition of his forces, and above all, the perfect discipline
</p>
<p>which had ever been maintained by him, now offered a silent barrier which caused
</p>
<p>the conspirators to entertain direful apprehensions, as to the disaster to themselves
</p>
<p>when they should make the undertaking, for the movements of the camp were
</p>
<p>noticed from the observatories near by, and on one occasion Brig. Gen. Walsh,

<p>accompanied by an attache of the Chicago Times, made a personal visit to the
</p>
<p>camp, and being received as gentlemen by the gallant Colonel, they were able to
</p>
<p>make certain discoveries of a disagreeable nature. The greatest precaution, of
</p>
<p>course, was observed in the transmission of dispatches by the writer to Col. Sweet,
</p>
<p>for had it been supposed for a moment, that the commander of the post was cog-
</p>
<p>nizant of their acts, it would most certainly have precipitated the uprising, as the
</p>
<p>leaders of the conspiracy could not hope for so favorable a time again. The camp
</p>
<p>was enclosed by only one thickness of inch boards, not over twelve feet high, and
</p>
<p>a little force of less than eight hundred men were to guard some eight or ten
</p>
<p>thousand prisoners, many of them being the lowest class of raiders and ruffians.

<p>34 THE GREAT NORTH WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>During the latter part of July, at a meeting of the Sons of Liberty, Colonel
</p>
<p>Walker, of Indiana, was present, and in a speech referred to the recent seizure of
</p>
<p>arms in Indiana, and said a formal demand had been made upon Governor Morton
</p>
<p>of that State for them, and if they were not forthcoming they (the copperheads)
</p>
<p>would compel restitution by the bullet, and said Morton would be assassinated i
</p>
<p>he refused. At this time a man named James A. Wilkinson was Grand Seignior
</p>
<p>of the temple. The question of supplying our quota to avoid the draft, agitating
</p>
<p>the community, it was proposed to resist the draft, and all the members were
</p>
<p>required forthwith to arm themselves with firearms, and Charles W. Patten and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson both offered to supply all who could not afford to purchase firearms.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson was a very efficient member of the order, and very zealous. Much of '
</p>
<p>his time he passed in the organization of temples in different sections of country;
</p>
<p>and it was often stated as encouragement for the members that the temples were
</p>
<p>rapidly multiplying, and being filled with the "best kind" of men. It was
</p>
<p>earnestly requested of the members, as the time was short  Judge Morris saying
</p>
<p>the purposes of the organization would be fulfilled within the next sixty days 
</p>
<p>to bring in as many new members as possible, and the injunction was duly
</p>
<p>heeded. The temple in Chicago thrived remarkably, and arrangements were
</p>
<p>made by which individuals could initiate members, and the initiated increased in

</p>
<p>The approach of the time fixed for the general uprising, witnessed remarkable
</p>
<p>and very unusual activity among the members of the Sons of Liberty, who now
</p>
<p>saw vividly the complete realization of their wishes, and were all, rank and file, in
</p>
<p>obedience to orders, busy with preparations. Little did the busy bustling city
</p>
<p>know of the plans and movements on foot. The same activity in trade, the same
</p>
<p>hopeful spirit among Union persons, the same gatherings at amusements, the same
</p>
<p>busy hum of industry as ever; nothing gave evidence of the existence of the ter-
</p>
<p>rible plot so soon to culminate, and to destroy by a single blow the hopes of our
</p>
<p>people,  to inaugurate a reign of terror as fearful as any in the history of the war.
</p>
<p>Citizens met and congratulated each other upon Union victories, and upon the
</p>
<p>probable speedy close of the national strife, and at the firesides of home discussed
</p>
<p>the terrible ravages of war, and as they knelt at the family altar, thanked God
</p>
<p>that our own city, and our State, and our section of the Union, had thus far been
</p>
<p>spared the immediate horrors and desolation which ever mark the theatre of war-
</p>
<p>fare. Who of all in our fair city, besides the guilty wretches who were plotting
</p>
<p>the ruin and slaughter, had even a foreboding of the trouble so nearly upon them.
</p>
<p>For rebels in arms to commit cruelties and barbarities would have been expected,
</p>
<p>but for the authors of our ruin to be our very friends and neighbors, persons asso-
</p>
<p>ciated with us in business avocations, in social relations, and in the enjoyment of
</p>
<p>the same general blessings with ourselves, surpassed belief; yet such was the fact,
</p>
<p>and the faces that beamed smiles upon us by day, and joined us in our congratula-
</p>
<p>lations for national victories, by night were hideous with the dark designs and
</p>
<p>murderous intent. The gunsmiths were busy, and trade in weapons of all kinds
</p>
<p>was brisk ; revolvers and knives particularly were articles of demand. So brisk
</p>
<p>and yet so silently and secretly, was the arming of individuals carried on, that
</p>
<p>weeks before the Convention assembled, but few, if any, of the members of Copper-

</p>
<p>other persons who might he less fortunate than themselves. It was indeed a dark
</p>
<p>picture to look in upon a group of the Sons of Liberty in their secure retreats, in
</p>
<p>the quiet hours of night, cleaning, repairing and inspecting their muskets and
</p>
<p>revolvers, moulding bullets, and making other preparations, and realizing that the
</p>
<p>mission of these monsters was the murder of men who dared proclaim and main-
</p>
<p>tain their devotion to the Union. Upon the streets treason became emboldened,
</p>
<p>as time rolled on, and not a few personal collisions occurred from its utterance.
</p>
<p>All this while that contemptible print, the Chicago Times, was instilling treason
</p>
<p>into the minds of its readers, and doing all that it could to embarrass the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, discourage patriotism, and to give aid and comfort to the rebels ; our victo-
</p>
<p>ries, with that sheet, were always unimportant; our cause was unholy; our
</p>
<p>President a despot; our Union soldiers were hirelings; our Union-loving citizens
</p>
<p>were abolition fanatics; Jeff Davis was a master spirit of the age; his generals
</p>
<p>the heroes of the Times; and rebel victories were events cheering and hope giv-
</p>
<p>ing, as they presaged the close of the war and peace ; peace at the sacrifice of the
</p>
<p>Union, of national honor, of national dignity and national interests. Such was
</p>
<p>the Chicago Times at that period  the darkest era in our history  and as well
</p>
<p>might we have looked for mercy from a hyena, or reason from a ghoul, as in the
</p>
<p>event of open insurrection in our city, to have looked to Wilbur F. Story, editor
</p>
<p>of the Times, to have endeavored to suppress the flames his incendiary print had
</p>
<p>for years been fanning into a blaze. And yet, citizens of Chicago and the West,
</p>
<p>this same Chicago Times, now, after the occupation of Richmond by our forces,
</p>
<p>and the surrender of Lee and all his forces, and the end of the rebellion is at
</p>
<p>hand, this same Chicago Times pretends to rejoice in our success, and sonie days
</p>
<p>turns a cold shoulder upon its old friend and patron, who has contributed to its
</p>
<p>circulation and prosperity for years  Jeff" Davis and really declares that his
</p>
<p>master's cause is hopeless. Most noble Story, most patriotic Story, most consistent
</p>
<p>Story ! Rather weep with the fallen fortunes of your masters. Flatter not your-
</p>
<p>self that the cloak of loyalty, which you have found it so convenient to fling around
</p>
<p>you, as our Union processions come marching along with thundering tread, that
</p>
<p>they will believe your conversion sincere and lasting; the cloak is not long enough
</p>
<p>to conceal your feet, and Union men will recognize the same Wilbur F. Story, and
</p>
<p>none will be so obtuse as not to discover under any disguise Bottom, the tailor.

<p>In the position of that Copperhead print, the state of mind of the Times man
</p>
<p>reminds us of an instance of what may be called poor consolation, A soldier of a
</p>
<p>division, after the command had run two days from the scene of an engagement
</p>
<p>had thrown away his gun and accoutrements, and alone in the woods sat down
</p>
<p>and commenced thinking  the first opportunity he had for doing so. Rolling up
</p>
<p>his sleeves, and looking at his legs and general physicpie, he thus gave utterance
</p>
<p>to his feelings : " I am whipped  badly whipped  and somewhat demoralized,
</p>
<p>but no man, thank God, can say I'm scattered!" And so the Chicago Times,
</p>
<p>though kicked out of respectable society long ago, continues to print its daily
</p>
<p>issues, while from the scarcity of Copperheads all at once, since our recent glorious
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 37
</p>
<p>victories, we infer that they have been " scattered ;" and as snakes cast their skins
</p>
<p>in the spring, so the Copperhead Times seems to have cast its own this season;
</p>
<p>but though it may appear in more pleasing garb with its present covering, let none
</p>
<p>forget that it is the same old Copperhead still. And the time will come when
</p>
<p>some enterprising showman will obtain and exhibit the last issue of that delectable
</p>
<p>sheet as the acme of treason and corruption during the war, and as an illustration
</p>
<p>of what villiany the mind of man may conceive, when he once turns against his
</p>
<p>country.
</p>
<p>About the period of which we write, say a month prior to the Convention,
</p>
<p>informal meetings of the Sons of Liberty were frequent, and large numbers of
</p>
<p>the members often went out of the city on excursions, nominally for pleasure, but
</p>
<p>really for practice with fire arms. The most active preparations were made by
</p>
<p>the Democrats, resident of Chicago, to be able to accommodate their brethren
</p>
<p>from abroad, who would attend the Convention, or who would pay them an earlier
</p>
<p>visit; for the time of the uprising, it will be remembered, had been fixed for about
</p>
<p>the middle of August. The time assigned arrived, but " all was quiet on the
</p>
<p>Potomac," and along the placid and fragrant Chicago. It was a complete fizzle,
</p>
<p>but not from want of harmonius action on the part of the Copperheads of the
</p>
<p>Northwest, but to the chagrin of the Rebel government, Gen. Price failed to
</p>
<p>make his appearance in the vicinity of St. Louis, or Buckner about Louisville.
</p>
<p>The disappointment and vexation of the Sons of Liberty was great, and it found
</p>
<p>expression in the peculiar style of oratory and diction, which Judge Morris had
</p>
<p>introduced into the Temple. The failure of the rebels to concur, as had been
</p>
<p>arranged, was for a time quite inexplicable and unsatisfactory to the most ultra
</p>
<p>secesh of the Temple. It was not easy to communicate with Price and Buckner,
</p>
<p>and much mystery and doubt hung over the failure. The leaders were in doubt
</p>
<p>as to the wisdom of rising at the Convention, some being in favor and others
</p>
<p>adverse to it. It was evident the leaders were not a little embarrassed, but they
</p>
<p>finally agreed that a large force of " bone and muscle " should be on hand in
</p>
<p>Chicago at the Convention, and if it was found that the War Democrats should
</p>
<p>be in the ascendency, and the Peace wing could get nothing  either platform or
</p>
<p>candidate  the uprising should occur at that time, but so confident were the
</p>
<p>Peace men that they should be able to have the control of the Convention, that

</p>
<p>Judge Morris and Brig.-Gen. Walsh, and other leaders, announced to the members
</p>
<p>of the Illini their entire belief that there would be no doubt of the success of
</p>
<p>the Peace wing, in that Convention, and if so, no insurrectionary movement would
</p>
<p>be expedient; but if the uprising did not occur then, it surely would at the time
</p>
<p>of the Presidential election, and in the time which would elapse between the
</p>
<p>Convention and the election, the most active and earnest efforts would be made to
</p>
<p>strengthen the numbers of the Temples of the Sons of Liberty, wherever they
</p>
<p>existed. Judge Morris had expressed the confident belief that no difficulty
</p>
<p>would occur at the Convention, but declared if they (the Copperheads) should
</p>
<p>meet with any interferance, the most serious results would follow.
</p>
<p>38 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>The rank and file who had been edified by such men as J. L. Rock, Charles
</p>
<p>W. Patten, James A. Wilkinson, L. C. Morrison, L. A. Doolittle, James Geary,
</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan, Mr. Dooley, Mr. Frank Adams, City Attorney, and many others
</p>
<p>were most impatient, and it was quite probable that a slight cause of offence with
</p>
<p>Union men would result in an open riot, that could not be suppressed till the
</p>
<p>grand aim of the Order was accomplished. About this time L. A. Doolittle, who
</p>
<p>was never tired of expressing his devotion to the distinguished exile Mr. Vallan-
</p>
<p>digham, announced that Mr. V., who was Supreme Commander of the whole
</p>
<p>Order, would honor the Chicago Temple with a visit during the Convention, but
</p>
<p>that worthy could not find time to make the visit. As the excitement of the
</p>
<p>coming Convention seized upon the minds of those who were to participate in it,
</p>
<p>much speech making was done inside the Temples. At these meetings the writer
</p>
<p>particularly noticed two members, who seemed to have fallen into disfavor by the
</p>
<p>course which they had seen fit to adopt. One of these men was Christopher C.
</p>
<p>Strawn, a young lawyer of this city, of some education, a very fair order of talents,
</p>
<p>and who had seemed hitherto taciturn and reserved. Upon conversation with him
</p>
<p>we were astonished to find that he did not approve of the Jeff. Davis principles,
</p>
<p>and had no fellowship with any overt act of treason. He had been appointed a
</p>
<p>Brigadier-General, on the ground of his supposed ability, but early took occasion
</p>
<p>to express himself, in such a manner that his commission was speedily revoked.
</p>
<p>Mr. Strawn was, he declares, not in the clique who favored a revolution. Mr.
</p>
<p>Strawn was subsequently arrested, but he was soon released, and freely commu-
</p>
<p>nicated truthful information to the authorities.
</p>
<p>During the summer an event truly unfortunate for the Sons of Liberty took
</p>
<p>place, it being an expose in the Chicago Tribune of the signs, grips, passwords,
</p>
<p>&c. of the order. This was a cause of great distress of mind. We remember that
</p>
<p>at a meeting about the 25th of August (Charles W. Patten presiding), the expe-
</p>
<p>diency of changing the signs, grips, &c. was considered, inasmuch as it would be
</p>
<p>unsafe to use them in public, but the lateness of the day, and the time drawing
</p>
<p>so near when the entire forces of the order would be called into requisition, it was
</p>
<p>not deemed expedient to undertake any change or modification. At this meeting ;
</p>
<p>Judge Morris made a speech in which he said that a demand had been made for
</p>
<p>arms seized in Indiana (as Col. Walker had proposed to do), and if the demand !

</p>
<p>failed, the revolution would be begun in Indiana "as sure as there was a God ini
</p>
<p>heaven or an abolitionist in hell."
</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Chicago Temple Sons of Liberty, on the eve of the Con-
</p>
<p>vention, we heard for the first time (and that from the mouth of L. A. Doolittle),
</p>
<p>a definite plan for the attack of Camp Douglas. Doolittle told how the camp was>
</p>
<p>situated, and that it was accessible on two sides ; that guns were in position on
</p>
<p>only one side, and the west side was referred to by him as being the weakest; he
</p>
<p>spoke of the common board fence which formed the enclosure, and of the ease with;
</p>
<p>which the camp could be taken, and the vast importance of liberating the prisoners
</p>
<p>the first thing upon an uprising. The speech of Doolittle was variously received ; \
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 39
</p>
<p>many of the members were much, interested ; others who were in the higher
</p>
<p>degrees of the order were vexed beyond measure that Doolittle should be so stupid
</p>
<p>as to proclaim, in this public manner, a matter which really belonged to higher
</p>
<p>degrees of the organization to decide. One of the number, James Geary, a second-
</p>
<p>hand clothes dealer and broker on Wells street, who will receive further mention
</p>
<p>by and by, became so much incensed that he ordered Mr. Doolittle to his seat,
</p>
<p>declaring, with an oath, that Doolittle was telling too much.
</p>
<p>At a meeting about this time, several of the members spoke upon the subject of
</p>
<p>releasing the prisoners at Camp Douglas. A map of Camp Douglas was exhibited
</p>
<p>by an individual present, who seemed to be a soldier. The map was a fine piece
</p>
<p>of work and had been made by a hand accustomed to such labor. Upon this
</p>
<p>map the precise position of the various departments, headquarters, cannon, &c,
</p>
<p>were laid down. There could be no shadow of doubt in the mind of any man
</p>
<p>not stupified with whiskey, and possessed of common sense, that the details of the
</p>
<p>attack had been carefully considered by those who were most interested in leading
</p>
<p>it on.
</p>
<p>It had for some time been the policy of the Sons of Liberty to unite with the
</p>
<p>Invincible Democratic Club and the various McClellan escorts in the city and
</p>
<p>elsewhere, and seek to become its oflicers, that in case of an outbreak it would be
</p>
<p>far better to be the controlling power, than to be controlled. This plan worked
</p>
<p>admirably, and the Democratic Invincible Club of Chicago became one of the
</p>
<p>most corrupt organizations outside the order of Sons of Liberty. Its secretary at
</p>
<p>one time was Charles W. Patten, who had been a Grand Seignior of the Chicago
</p>
<p>Temple, was also a member of the Grand Council, and had taken a very active
</p>
<p>part in the prosperity of the order, and was chairman of the committee to see that
</p>
<p>all the Sons of Liberty were armed. One of the oflicers of the above named Club
</p>
<p>was Capt. P. D. Parks, whose devotion to Jeff. Davis and good whiskey were
</p>
<p>noticeable features in his character. This Capt. Parks was captain of the Invin-
</p>
<p>cible Club and often made speeches in the Sons of Liberty Hall.
</p>
<p>On Saturday the 26th August (two days prior to the National Democratic Con-
</p>
<p>vention), immense numbers of persons came flocking to Chicago, indeed at no
</p>
<p>former time in the history of the city was there such an influx of strangers ; they
</p>
<p>came in the cars and in wagon trains, and on horseback. One county alone sent

<p>nearly a thousand men. It was a noticeable fact that almost all persons who came
</p>
<p>into the city were well armed, and some of them even brought muskets. Treason
</p>
<p>was now rampant, and it would not be difficult, in looking around upon the most
</p>
<p>unprepossessing groups, and to hear the language, to fancy one's-self in Charleston,
</p>
<p>or some other nest of treason. From all the men who came to the city we did not,
</p>
<p>in a single instance, hear one good, hearty expression of Unionism, but our " South-
</p>
<p>ern brethren and their rights," and this "wicked war," &c, &c, were the topics
</p>
<p>of conversation, and it was safe to set it down, that this was the Peace wing of that
</p>
<p>most remarkable bird,  Democracy of 18G4.

</p>
<p>hostile intentions of the party transpired, that was not known instantly by Col.
</p>
<p>Sweet,  special carriers or orderlies conveying our dispatches. It must not be
</p>
<p>supposed that our observations were confined to Chicago. Our channels of com-
</p>
<p>munication with the principal points in the West were unobstructed ; our " tel-
</p>
<p>egraphic cable " was in fine working order, and if those wise heads for a moment
</p>
<p>fancied that Col. B. J. Sweet might be caught napping, they were the worst self-
</p>
<p>deceived men we have ever seen. Col. Sweet proceeded with all caution and
</p>
<p>celerity to make his arrangements, and we beg the Colonel not to regard it as a
</p>
<p>breach of confidence in us to say, that the guns were in such a position and so well
</p>
<p>managed, that had there been any attempt to have assaulted the camp, there would
</p>
<p>not have been able-bodied traitors enough left, to have carried the killed and
</p>
<p>wounded to secure retreats. Almost any officer, perhaps, less cool than Col. Sweet
</p>
<p>would have blustered about in such a manner as to have rendered himself not only
</p>
<p>positively offensive to the citizens, but would have placed the city under martial
</p>
<p>law, and doubtless precipitated the very event it was wise for a time to avert. Col.
</p>
<p>Sweet was cool, and managed the matter with the most perfect military ability
</p>
<p>and skill. He compelled everybody, friend and foe, to respect him by his digni-
</p>
<p>fied, gentlemanly bearing, and yet there was that about his appearance that told
</p>
<p>plainer than words, that while he was courteous, polite, kind and willing to do all
</p>
<p>in his power and consistent with his duty to preserve the peace, yet had an out-
</p>
<p>break been begun, of all men in Chicago, rebels and sympathisers would prefer to
</p>
<p>get as far as possible from Col. Sweet, or the reach of his influence. This gallant
</p>
<p>officer had his men under such perfect discipline that a simple request, even when
</p>
<p>the men were not on duty, was obeyed with the alacrity as if it had been a per-
</p>
<p>emptory order. The discovery that Col. Sweet was ready for them, which discovery
</p>
<p>was early made and duly reported, had much to do with the good order which

</p>
<p>The extraordinary activity of recruiting for the Sons of Liberty, and the zeal
</p>
<p>displayed by the master spirit of the Temple was ominous of the wicked work
</p>
<p>they might be called upon to perform. James A. Wilkinson, who was elected
</p>
<p>Grand Senior, was too young a man in the estimation of many, and he was about
</p>
<p>to resign, when Judge Morris remarked, that " age was not always wisdom " (the
</p>
<p>truth of which his own career has fully illustrated,) and by request Wilkinson
</p>
<p>continued to hold the post. The old order for arming of members was called up,
</p>
<p>and all were required to comply with the condition at once ; a particular pattern
</p>
<p>of revolvers was specially recommended, and it was ascertained that the members
</p>
<p>were in almost every instance, fully armed. A young man named R. T. Semmes,
</p>
<p>who was said to be a near relative to the commander of the rebel pirate Alabama,
</p>
<p>was appointed to deliver an address before the Order, but this duty was never
</p>
<p>complied with in a formal manner, as it was subsequently thought Judge Morris
</p>
<p>was better qualified, he being in a higher degree than Mr. Semmes, to impart such
</p>
<p>information as the lower degree should know. Upon an occasion of a special
</p>
<p>meeting, the Judge made a long address, in which he stated the number of
</p>
<p>members of the Order in Illinois at 80,000 men, saying they were all well drilled
</p>
<p>and could be implicitly relied upon, at the right time ; members were enjoined to
</p>
<p>remember their obligations to sustain the principles of the Order, and to aid each
</p>
<p>other. The Judge stated that " we " (the Sons of Liberty,) had two fall regiments
</p>
<p>all well armed and drilled, in Chicago, and that a third was forming. Such
</p>
<p>cheering information was received with great gratification, and gave a greater
</p>
<p>impetus to the recruiting for the Order.
</p>
<p>The question of the draft agitated the members at each meeting, and all declared
</p>
<p>their purpose never to go to the army, either voluntarily or otherwise, to fight our
</p>
<p>brethren, "whose cause was just and right," and a strong attempt was made to
</p>
<p>array the organization by formal action to oppose the Government, and those
</p>
<p>especially who were impatient for the general uprising, thought it a timely oppor-

</p>
<p>hostility and presented a bold and united front instantly upon the firing of the
</p>
<p>first gun upon Fort Sumter, so would it be in all the States of the Northwestern
</p>
<p>league ; they would at once rise, when knowing that their brethren of Chicago
</p>
<p>were in arms against the "usurper and his hirelings;" but these hasty counsels
</p>
<p>did not prevail, and individuals, were exhorted to take care of themselves if drafted,
</p>
<p>but on no account to go to the army.
</p>
<p>Not only was there remarkable activity in the Chicago Temple just prior to the
</p>
<p>Convention, but in all the States where the order existed. Our Indiana neighbors
</p>
<p>often sent their worst Copperheads to the Chicago Temple to receive instructions
</p>
<p>in regard to the mode of initiation ; and about this time, a man named Westfall,
</p>
<p>of Elkhart, Indiana, appeared in the Temple, and edified the members with most
</p>
<p>encouraging accounts of the order in his own State. He was properly qualified as
</p>
<p>a Grand Seignor, and no doubt served with that grace and dignity of which his
</p>
<p>appearance gave such promise. It is hoped that the citizens of Elkhart appreciate
</p>
<p>this gentleman's devotion to " the great cause." Judge T. H. Marsh was put
</p>
<p>through a similar course of training, and being possessed of remarkable dignity,
</p>
<p>n doubt made an excellent Grand Seignor. If he was not fit for a good Judge,
</p>
<p>he was fit for a Son of Liberty. He no doubt remembers the artist, who by an
</p>
<p>unlucky daub, spoiled his picture of an angel, but took fresh courage, declaring
</p>
<p>it would make an excellent devil. So the judge may make his own application.
</p>
<p>The day of the great Convention at length dawned upon at least a hundred
</p>
<p>thousand strangers in Chicago. Every hotel was densely packed from cellar to
</p>
<p>garret, private houses were filled to their uttermost capacity, while hundreds the
</p>
<p>night before, who could not find any kind of a shelter, took in plenty of whisky
</p>
<p>to prevent catching cold, and laid themselves quietly at rest in the gutters, much
</p>
<p>to the consternation of the myriads of rats that infest our streets. These street
</p>
<p>sleepers now arose, and shaking themselves, their toilet was complete. Of all the
</p>
<p>God-forsaken, shaggy-haired, red-faced, un-shorn, hard-fisted, blasphemous wretches
</p>
<p>that have ever congregated, even at the gallows at Newgate, many of the visitors
</p>
<p>of the Peace wing of the Democracy were entitled to the first consideration. Still
</p>
<p>there was no collision with the citizens, although the representatives of the " unter-
</p>
<p>rified " had sworn that there should be no arrests in Chicago during the Convention.
</p>
<p>The better class of strangers were War Democrats, and it was evident they had no

</p>
<p>fellowship for the raginufnns of the Peace wing.
</p>
<p>It should here be stated that the Order of the Sons of Liberty had purchased
</p>
<p>firearms, carbines, pistols, shot guns and rifles, and at the time of the Convention
</p>
<p>had stored in the city of Chicago, arms, for at least ten thousand men. These arms
</p>
<p>had been brought here at various times ; some of them had been brought by
</p>
<p>vessels and others by rail, and were now safely deposited in four different depots
</p>
<p>in Chicago, the locations of which were known only to the Sons themselves. From
</p>
<p>these four principal depots one or more boxes of arms were taken on such occa-
</p>
<p>sions as would best serve, and placed in- trust with some out-and-out rebel sym-
</p>
<p>pathizer in the different wards, so that at the time of the general uprising the
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 43
</p>
<p>" faithful " could readily obtaiu supplies. On one occasion Brig.-Gen. Walsh
</p>
<p>applied to II. A. Phelps, on State street, with a request for him to receive two
</p>
<p>boxes of muskets, but that man did not like to incur the risk, whatever his sym-
</p>
<p>pathies may have been, and the arms were not deposited with him.
</p>
<p>It was quite apparent, the first day of the Convention, that our citizens had
</p>
<p>resolved to act upon the advice of Adjutant-General Fuller, to let these fellows
</p>
<p>" have their jaw out," and they did have it out, and became terrible bores.
</p>
<p>At an early hour, the temporary building erected for this gathering, near Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Avenue, was crowded to excess, and after beginning their labors all the
</p>
<p>speakers, without exception, entertained the audience and relieved themselves of
</p>
<p>the most violent denunciations of President Lincoln, and the pojicy of the admin-
</p>
<p>istration. Each speaker vied with the last in culling from his vocabulary of hard
</p>
<p>words, terms sufficiently expressive of their feelings toward the government, but
</p>
<p>do as well as they might, even with the aid of the poorest quality of whiskey and
</p>
<p>education, evidently of many years among the lowest of the low, not one of them
</p>
<p>could out-do the Chicago Times. The only parties who could approximate it were
</p>
<p>Gov. Harris of Maryland, and Long of Ohio, who were most decidedly in favor of
</p>
<p>secession. The differences between the War Democrats and the Peace men, well
</p>
<p>nigh ended in personal violence, and would, but for timely interference of the
</p>
<p>police. It is not our purpose to report the doings of the Convention, and an
</p>
<p>allusion is only made to call special attention to the elements which made up the
</p>
<p>party who gave to General George B. McClellan a nomination which proved to
</p>
<p>him the worst punishment that could have been inflicted, and exhibited him to the
</p>
<p>world in worse company than he had ever before mingled. The hostility between
</p>
<p>the different factions of the party, but rendered the Peace wing or Sons of Liberty
</p>
<p>the more united, and more firmly bent upon the overthrow of the government, as
</p>
<p>they saw clearly enough, even before the adjournment, that there was not a shadow
</p>
<p>of hope of electing the ticket formed, and the only hope of genuine copperheads
</p>
<p>now laid in the election of State officers, and Judge Morris told the people " if we
</p>
<p>can but get our Governor and Lieut.-Governor, it is all we ask for ) the order is
</p>
<p>strong enough in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Iowa and Ohio to enable
</p>
<p>us to take the general government into our own hands." He added, " as the
</p>
<p>Washington government had not seen fit to execute the Constitution and the laws,

</p>
<p>we will bring them to Illinois and execute them ourselves."
</p>
<p>At the close of the Convention, and the compromise had been made by the
</p>
<p>different factions of the party, then came a time for general rejoicing. In the
</p>
<p>evening torchlight processions, with lanterns and transparencies bearing devices
</p>
<p>and mottos, all expressive of their animosity at the administration. At the head
</p>
<p>of one of these processions was Maj.-Gen. Barrett, the military commander of
</p>
<p>Illinois. At that very time Barrett had in his pocket a programme, which had an
</p>
<p>intimation been received from Price or Buckner, would have been of fearful
</p>
<p>import to the citizens of Chicago. Barrett had at one time lived in Chicago, but
</p>
<p>for some months past was a resident of Missouri. He was thoroughly armed, and
</p>
<p>44 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>well knew the elements that had assembled in the city. Barrett had been in the
</p>
<p>rebel service, or rather we should say in another arm of the service, inasmuch as
</p>
<p>none in these days, when all men are for the Union, and it is so easy to be a
</p>
<p>patriot, will pretend to deny that the Sons of Libeity were as much an arm of
</p>
<p>service for Jeff. Davis as his artillery or infantry. This fellow Barrett, had on
</p>
<p>one occasion, as appears by testimony before the Cincinnati military commission,
</p>
<p>visited Chicago as an accredited agent of the Davis government, but he was not
</p>
<p>molested, and mingled with men of his own stripe, without fear and without diffi-
</p>
<p>culty. It will be interesting by and by, to read of the Chicago Convention, and
</p>
<p>the incongruous elements there assembled. But as all things have an end, so did
</p>
<p>this remarkable gathering, and dispersed quietly, never again to meet as the
</p>
<p>representatives of the American people.
</p>
<p>Of course most of the Roughs of the Peace wing had been indueed to come
</p>
<p>to Chicago, with the idea that an uprising was imminent, and would no doubt
</p>
<p>take place, when they would be able to repay themselves abundantly from the
</p>
<p>property of our citizens. It is not strange therefore, that these half starved,
</p>
<p>brutal wretches looked with evil eyes upon our National banks, and hoped till
</p>
<p>the last that some lucky incident might occur which would provoke an outbreak,
</p>
<p>and they would have an opportunity to pillage our banks, stores and dwellings,
</p>
<p>but they were doomed to disappointment, and with surly looks and threats of
</p>
<p>vengeance, left the city, resolved at a future day to draw their pay, principle and
</p>
<p>interest, from our banks, and we shall, in a future chapter, see the manifestation

</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Sons of Liberty in September, 1864, a plan was reported,
</p>
<p>much to the relief of those who had a horror of conscription ; it was arranged
</p>
<p>that such of the members as might be drafted, should report within three days to
</p>
<p>the Grand Senior of the Temple, and they would be supplied with means to
</p>
<p>defray their expenses to the southern part of the State, where they would remain
</p>
<p>till their services should be required, and that they would find friends there,
</p>
<p>strong enough in numbers, to defy the officers of the law. Such persons were to
</p>
<p>form military organizations, and to be drilled and disciplined by rebel officers sent
</p>
<p>thither for that express purpose. The " Sons " of Chicago expressed their
</p>
<p>extreme regret at the very open and defiant manner of their brethren in the
</p>
<p>southern part of the State, and believed that it would be predjudicial to the
</p>
<p>prosperity of the Order.
</p>
<p>Our readers have not forgotten the Coles county tragedy, the murderers and
</p>
<p>their victims. There is not a particle of doubt that those murders were premed-
</p>
<p>itated, and first the subject of discussion in the temples of the Sons of Liberty.
</p>
<p>The assault was made without provocation, and the thirst for the blood of Union
</p>
<p>men was the motive for the deed. We have never advocated or countenanced
</p>
<p>mob law, but if there was ever a time in the history of our government in which
</p>
<p>it was justifiable, it was in the cases of the Coles county murderers. The times
</p>
<p>seemed, perhaps, to have demanded a vigilance committee of citizens, who would
</p>
<p>administer justice fast enough to suit the emergency of the cases upon which they
</p>
<p>might be called to adjudicate, and having "cleaned out" the murderous scoun-
</p>
<p>drels in that locality, they might have found a demand for their services in
</p>
<p>Chicago. But it is better that the people controlled their just indignation and
</p>
<p>left it to time, to punish the infamous wretches who turned their arms and their
</p>
<p>all against the country, to whom they are indebted for all the blessings which they
</p>
<p>proved themselves to be utterly incapable of appreciating. It was the boast of
</p>
<p>the " Sons " that their numbers embraced many of the officers of our armies, and

<p>the names of several were mentioned, who had sworn that they would never fire
</p>
<p>46 THE GREAT NORTII-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>or order their commands to fire upon " our Southern brethren," and it was added
</p>
<p>that such officers could serve the cause of this order better in the field, than in any
</p>
<p>other manner.
</p>
<p>As time passed on, the plans of the villains belonging to the Chicago Temple, or
</p>
<p>the plans of the order throughout the State for the attack upon Camp Douglas
</p>
<p>became more complete in their details. The policy of obtaining positions for
</p>
<p>members upon all the railroads and in telegraph offices, was very popular with the
</p>
<p>order, and it was confidently stated, that upon the release of the prisoners the
</p>
<p>leaders would at once take full possession of the railroads and telegraph offices.
</p>
<p>It was arranged that the attack upon the camp should be made the night after
</p>
<p>election, as it now became fully apparent to all that there was not a shadow of a
</p>
<p>chance to elect either National or State ticket by the Copperheads. Fires were
</p>
<p>to be kindled in different parts of the city, and these were to be so numerous that
</p>
<p>they would necessarily divert the attention of the citizens, while the attack should
</p>
<p>be made. Near the camp is a growth of small oaks and other small wood which
</p>
<p>offered a fine retreat or hiding place for those who would attack the camp. The
</p>
<p>attacking party were to go singly or in groups which might not attract attention,
</p>
<p>and when they were in readiness, they were suddenly to spring forward and com-
</p>
<p>mence an assault simultaneously on three sides of the enclosure. The risk to the
</p>
<p>invading party was not considered large, as the whole undertaking would be but
</p>
<p>the work of a few moments, and it was confidently believed that some communi-
</p>
<p>cation could previously be established with the rebels by their desperate friends
</p>
<p>and allies upon the outside ; and it is now quite certain that some intelligence was
</p>
<p>communicated to the rebels, and well understood by them, as not long before the
</p>
<p>election, supposed signals in the way of rockets, blue lights, &c. were at one time
</p>
<p>exhibited by a small group of persons, without any apparent design, which could
</p>
<p>have been distinctly seen at camp. Mrs. Morris, who has confessed her com-
</p>
<p>plicity with the rebel sympathizers, was a frequent visitor to the camp, and it was
</p>
<p>thought that she might be very useful in conveying letters, messages, &c. Indeed
</p>
<p>it was morally certain that there was an understanding between the rebels inside,
</p>
<p>and the cowardly dogs on the outside of the post. It will be remembered that
</p>
<p>fire arms for at least ten thousand men were safely and secretly stored in Chicago,
</p>
<p>and that there was a perfect understanding between the members of the higher

</p>
<p>degrees of the Sons of Liberty, and the leaders of the invading party from Canada-
</p>
<p>Had the attack been made, however good the understanding between the " Sons '
</p>
<p>and the rebels might have been, the former would soon have found, to their sur-
</p>
<p>prise and to their dismay, that their glory would suddenly have departed, for the
</p>
<p>released rebels would instantly have obeyed the commands of their own officers,
</p>
<p>and Northern Sons of Liberty would have been compelled to fall into line, whether
</p>
<p>they would or not. A few of the Sons would have received some consideration,
</p>
<p>and this would especially have been the case with Brig.-Gen. Charles Walsh, but
</p>
<p>in the main the " accursed democracy,"  as one rebel writing to another was pleased
</p>
<p>to speak of the order  was to be kept in the front, or in other words, used aa
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 47
</p>
<p>circumstances might require to do the vilest offices of this vile and devilish conspiracy.
</p>
<p>As the time of the election was drawing near, the Sons of Liberty expressed a
</p>
<p>wish to have a man at their head, in the place of Wilkinson, who would command
</p>
<p>respect, and whose appearance of dignity and years would impress new comers
</p>
<p>most favorably. This man was found in Obadiah Jackson, Jr. Esq., as Grand
</p>
<p>Seignior, and so much gratified were they with his peculiar fitness for this distin-
</p>
<p>guished honor, that they resolved to find a second officer, or Ancient Brother, and
</p>
<p>Lewis C Morrison gave place to a Mr. Hoffman.
</p>
<p>Things were now working smoothly, new members were rapidly joining, and it
</p>
<p>was evident that the new organization was most favorable for the growth and
</p>
<p>unity of tbe Order. The rapidly increasing number of Temples in every part of
</p>
<p>the State, would have been truly alarming to the friends of the Union. New
</p>
<p>comers were introduced at every meeting, and large numbers were initiated at
</p>
<p>Judge Morris' residence, where favored individuals were also initiated in the
</p>
<p>mysteries of the higher degrees ; so that there were hundreds of persons, in good
</p>
<p>standing with the Order as bona fide members, who seldom or never visited the
</p>
<p>lodge room ; this was especially the case with the higher grade of persons  the
</p>
<p>politicians, lawyers and others. At a meeting in the autumn, Judge Morris was
</p>
<p>present and made a speech in response to the request of several members, who
</p>
<p>asked information concerning the immediate purposes of the Order. He spoke,
</p>
<p>as was his custom, of the tyranny of the Pressdent; he said the rights of the
</p>

<p>He referred to the suspension of the habeas corpus, and said many of our best
</p>
<p>men were at that moment " rotting in Lincoln's bastiles ; " that it was our duty to
</p>
<p>wage a war against them, and open their doors ; that when the Democrats got
</p>
<p>into power they would impeach and probably hang him, and all who were thu3
</p>
<p>incarcerated should be set at liberty; that thousands of our best men were
</p>
<p>prisoners in Camp Douglas, and if once at liberty would " send abolitionists to
</p>
<p>hell in a hand basket;" he said the meanest of those prisoners was purity itself
</p>
<p>compared to " Lincoln's hirelings." He added that the tyranny of " Abraham the
</p>
<p>First" was fast drawing to a close, and those who were anxious to fight, would not
</p>
<p>have to wait long. He also spoke in favor of retaliation.

<p>gesticulation ; he never spoke except to condemn the administration, and to express
</p>
<p>his confidence in this Order to remedy all the evils of the administration, and that
</p>
<p>we fhould very soon  " in sixty days," have the power, and yet on several occasions
</p>
<p>xpressed the belief that McClellan would not be elected. No one, not even
</p>
<p>oiost stupid in the first degree of the Temple, could fail to understand how
</p>
<p>Copperheads were to have the reins of the General Government in sixty days,
</p>
<p>yet that the party could not hope for success at the polls.
</p>
<p>man named William Hull, connected with the Order, rebuked such speeches in
</p>
<p>mlified terms, and as a consequence drew down upon himself the odium of the
</p>
<p>ir. Mr. Hull expressed himself in favor of compliance with the Constitution
</p>
<p>48 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and the laws, and of the Union. His denunciations of the rebels excluded him
</p>
<p>from the confidence of the leaders, who began to regard him as a " dangerous
</p>
<p>man/' and expressed the belief that he would turn against them, and therefore
</p>
<p>required watching. Mr. Hull was a man of good common sense, and made several
</p>
<p>Union speeches in the Order, which confirmed the suspicion that had been
</p>
<p>expressed by some, that he was a spy and detective, and it was said it would be
</p>
<p>far better to put Mm out of the way, or in other words to kill him, lest he might
</p>
<p>betray them, and further as th time of the election was so near at hand, it was
</p>
<p>voted by the Sons of Liberty to destroy all their records, so that in case of arrest
</p>
<p>no documentary evidence could be brought against them. While the motion was
</p>
<p>pending, Mr. Richard T. Semmes, one of the prisoners tried at Cincinnati, moved
</p>
<p>an amendment, that the names of members be retained, so that in case any one
</p>
<p>should betray the Order they might be known and hung, but it was not deemed
</p>
<p>safe to preserve the record, and most of the memoranda was destroyed, but for the
</p>
<p>edification of the members, we will add that we have on deposite in Chicago an
</p>
<p>entire and correct list of names of the Chicago, and most of the prominent Tem-
</p>
<p>ples, and it may be deemed expedient to publish it hereafter; this will be deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the general behavior of the members themselves.
</p>
<p>In regard to Mr. Hull, to whom we have alluded, it should be said that hie
</p>
<p>death was fixed upon by the members. Felton and Morrison agreed to do the
</p>
<p>work, but afterwards another proposition was made, to give him money and induce
</p>
<p>him to leave for parts unknown. This peaceable disposition of the man was not
</p>
<p>satisfactory. Said they, (i dead men tell no tales," and at an informal meeting, a
</p>
<p>vote was taken and all, with a single exception, present were in favor of death.
</p>
<p>That exception required more satisfactory evidence that Hull was the informer,
</p>
<p>and thus the murder of the man was prevented. The writer has not a particle of
</p>
<p>doubt, having been present at this meeting and heard the proposition and the vote
</p>
<p>taken, that the murder would have been perpetrated within twenty-four hours had
</p>
<p>not a single person been so exacting in regard to the facts. It may readily be
</p>
<p>believed that the writer never mingled in this murderous company without a brace
</p>
<p>of revolvers in his pocket, ready for instant use, and it may be no stretch of
</p>
<p>credulity to believe, that in case of an assault, the instruments would have been
</p>
<p>called into requisition.

<p>^ITE Reasons why Rebel Agents were sent to Canada, and

<p>their Doings  Various Plots op Mischief, Harrassing, Pil-
</p>
<p>laging, &c.  The Watchword of the Rebels in Canada.
</p>
<p>The United States armies being continually pressed forward, step by step,
</p>
<p>towards the heart of the Confederacy, occupying more and more of the soil
</p>
<p>from which their commissary was but illy and scantily supplied, together with a de-
</p>
<p>sire on the part of the Southern people, to let the people of the North see what inva-
</p>
<p>sion meant, to make them feel and see the destruction and desolation following
</p>
<p>our army of invasion, determined the Richmond government, in 1863, to send its
</p>
<p>agents to the Canadas, well supplied with money, to endeavor to foment discord,
</p>
<p>and to intensify the dissatisfaction already existing in certain political circles, with
</p>
<p>the government, to such an extent that it could be made available for their own
</p>
<p>uses and purposes. Knowing that thousands of their soldiers were confined at
</p>
<p>Johnston's Island, and Camp Douglas near Chicago, almost within twelve hours'
</p>
<p>travel of Canada, it was the great object of the rebel government to release those
</p>
<p>prisoners of war, and in the mean time having stirred up and excited a formidable
</p>
<p>conspiracy in the North, particularly in the North -West, having in view the sub-
</p>
<p>version of the government, and the securing of material aid and assistance to the
</p>
<p>rebels, and those rebel prisoners being released through the instrumentality of the
</p>
<p>rebels from Canada and those of the Northern sympathizers who could be induced
</p>
<p>to join in the expeditions for that purpose, the conspiracy was to culminate all
</p>
<p>over the North  but principally in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri
</p>
<p>and New York, and effect the release of the prisoners of war confined in the
</p>
<p>various prisons in those States. The prisoners at all these places being released,
</p>
<p>were to form a nucleus around which all the dissatisfied people of the Northern
</p>
<p>States could rally, and endeavor to maintain themselves and their cause here in
</p>
<p>the North, and by rallying in formidable numbers, to cause the withdrawal of so
</p>
<p>many troops from the field in front, to establish peace at home, that it would mate-
</p>
<p>rially change the whole character of the war, and remove the seat of war from the
</p>
<p>cotton States to the Northern States  Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri. Upon
</p>
<p>the withdrawal of the troops in any considerable numbers from the front, was to

<p>Sterling Price would never have invaded the State of Missouri in the fall of 1864,
</p>
<p>had it not been to give all the aid and assistance the rebellion could afford, to the
</p>
<p>conspiracy just then ready to break loose, and this explains the position that Hood
</p>
<p>occupied for nearly two months in Northern Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee.
</p>
<p>He would never have placed himself in such a position, had it not been deemed
</p>
<p>absolutely necessary by the Richmond Government, that his army should be placed
</p>
<p>where upon the breaking out of the conspiracy he could exercise a great influence
</p>
<p>over its prospects of success. To further the objects and views just stated, Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson, of Miss., formerly Secretary of the Interior under Buchanan's admin-
</p>
<p>istration, was made a secret agent for the Rebel Government in the Canadas, and
</p>
<p>two hundred and fifty or three hundred thousand dollars in specie, or its equivalent,
</p>
<p>was placed in his hands by the Rebel Government, for the purpose of arming and
</p>
<p>equiping any expedition he might place on foot from British America, for the in-
</p>
<p>jury of the inland or ocean commerce of the United States, or harrassing its
</p>
<p>Northern borders, and particularly for the release of the Rebel prisoners of war
</p>
<p>at Camp Douglas and Johnston Island, and from the beginning of Mr. Thompson's
</p>
<p>cervices in Canada, we may date all the regularly organized and officered expedi-
</p>
<p>tions from British America against the United States. Chief of all these expedi-
</p>
<p>tions were the two attempts, during last year, to release the prisoners of war at
</p>
<p>Camp Douglas, near Chicago, 111., and the two different attempts to capture the
</p>
<p>steamer "Michigan" (a United States vessel of war stationed on Lake Erie, car-
</p>
<p>rying eighteen guns), and release the prisoners on Johnston's Island. All four of
</p>
<p>these expeditions failed totally in the objects for which they were organized,
</p>
<p>mainly by some friendly parties having put the military authorities on their guard
</p>
<p>soon enough to enable them to defeat the attempts, and in some instances to capture
</p>
<p>the parties concerned in them.
</p>
<p>To aid Mr. Thompson in his nefarious efforts in Canada, several officers of
</p>
<p>rarious ranks were detailed from the Rebel army, by the Richmond government,
</p>
<p>most prominent among these were Col. St. Leger Grenfell, an Englishman of
</p>
<p>great military experience and daring, and Capt. T. II. Hines, a young officer, who
</p>
<p>having been one of Gen. John A. Morgan's pets, was recommended by him for the
</p>
<p>position he held in Canada, but who was possessed of no more than ordinary
</p>
<p>military talents or genius, unless his shrewdness in getting other and better

</p>
<p>persons involved in difficulty, and condemned either to prison or death, and getting
</p>
<p>himself out, evidenced military prowess. In connection with these men, were a
</p>
<p>great many citizens,fof both the United States and the South, who while they were
</p>
<p>not authorized to act in any way by the Rebel government, yet showed their zeal
</p>
<p>in the cause of the rebellion, by aiding and advising with Mr. Thompson, and
</p>
<p>advising and exhorting all the rebel soldiers in Canada, and the refugees from the
</p>
<p>Northern States, to take an active part in the different schemes there on foot, to
</p>
<p>harrass the northern border of the United States.
</p>
<p>The most prominent of this class were George N. Sanders, C C Clay, formerly
</p>
<p>Representative in the United States Congress from Alabama, Col. Steele and
</p>
<p>Daniel Hibber. There was still another secret agent of the rebels on special duty
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 53
</p>
<p>in Canada, viz., Judge Holcombe of Virginia, who was sent there for the purpose
</p>
<p>of secretly establishing agencies for the returning of rebel soldiers, who desired
</p>
<p>to go South. However much Mr. Holcombe's mission removed him from military
</p>
<p>matters, ho nevertheless approved of the different expeditions which were then
</p>
<p>being organized, and did more perhaps, than any one else, to cause the irritation
</p>
<p>now existing between the Canadians and the citizens of the United States.
</p>
<p>His policy in establishing agencies in Canada, was to get some prominent and
</p>
<p>influential citizens of the country who sympathized with his government; to act
</p>
<p>as agents to furnish rebel soldiers who had escaped to Canada, and who desired to
</p>
<p>return South, with all the necessary clothing, rations and money, &c, to enable
</p>
<p>them to go to Montreal or Quebec, where there were regularly established rebel
</p>
<p>agencies, who upon the arrival of such soldiers so furnisbed with money, for all
</p>
<p>the money so advanced, with perhaps interest, was returned. In this way Mr.
</p>
<p>Holcombe enlisted, besides the feelings, the interests of a great many prominent
</p>
<p>business men, whose means had been advanced to rebels, and all along tbe Grand
</p>
<p>Trunk and Great Western railway, in all the principal towns and cities, he
</p>
<p>succeeded in establishing such agencies, which although at first intended only for
</p>
<p>those who were rebel soldiers, finally became nothing more than recruiting rendez-
</p>
<p>vous for the rebel army, which all the skedadlers, refugees from tbe Northern and
</p>
<p>Border States who wished to join tbe Southern army, were received, fed, clothed
</p>
<p>and quietly transported to the South.
</p>
<p>Upon the departure of Mr. Holcombe south, his business was turned over to
</p>
<p>C. C. Clay, who after that acted in this capacity. It was during Holcombe's stay
</p>
<p>in Canada, that the speculative brain of George N. Sanders, first originated the
</p>
<p>great humbug of the Niagara Falls peace conference, at which there was but one
</p>
<p>rebel official, and he was not authorized to act in any such capacity. But the
</p>
<p>speculative Sanders, having lived like Barnum nearly his whole life, upon hum-
</p>
<p>bugs, made his last and greatest effort to humbug the American people, into the
</p>
<p>belief that the Southern people really desired peace, and that he Clay and Hol-
</p>
<p>combe, although not regularly authorized by the Rebel government, still could
</p>
<p>speak for and influence the Southern people. While in reality the whole confer-
</p>
<p>ence was nothing on the part of Sanders & Co., but the last act of a desperate
</p>
<p>political gamester, who ventured his all upon one last throw of dice, to win or

</p>
<p>lose it all. If Sanders, Holcombe, Clay and others, could have made the people of
</p>
<p>the North believe the South really desired peace, and that the only obstacle in the
</p>
<p>way was the obstinacy of the General Government, which did not desire it, but
</p>
<p>wished to annihilate the Southern people, they could have materially affected the
</p>
<p>then coming Presidential election in the North, and perhaps elected a Democratio
</p>
<p>president, who would have added to the disasters then affecting the country  general
</p>
<p>and complete ruin. The election of such a man as Gen. McClellan, at such a
</p>
<p>time, and professing such principles as actuated the Democratic party at that time,
</p>
<p>would have insured to the South her independence, rather than further war and
</p>
<p>a dismemberment of the Union. All jthis these parties professing to represent

</p>
<p>Southern opinion well knew, and had they been successful, would have reaped a
</p>
<p>rich political reward.
</p>
<p>Having endeavored to give a correct outline of the characters of the rebel leaders
</p>
<p>in Canada, and the different spheres in which they acted, it is now necessary to
</p>
<p>give some idea of the different classes of individuals who were led by such men,
</p>
<p>and prompted by them to undertake the many hair-brained expeditions, which
</p>
<p>they first plotted and started. These persons are rightfully and very expressively
</p>
<p>divided into four different and distinct classes : 1st. The Rebels. 2d. The ske-
</p>
<p>daddlers. 3d. Refugees. 4th. Bounty jumpers and escaped criminals. The term
</p>
<p>rebel is applied only to persons who have been or are connected with the rebel
</p>
<p>army, and they again are subdivided into two classes ; first, those rebels who have
</p>
<p>gone to Canada as a means of escape to the South ; and, secondly, those who,
</p>
<p>having been accustomed to easy and luxurious living in times of peace, and having
</p>
<p>become thoroughly disgusted with service in the army, where they were subjected
</p>
<p>to strict military discipline, sought in Canada an asylum from compulsory service
</p>
<p>of both parties. 2d. Skedaddlers, as they are called, are those persons who having
</p>
<p>been drafted, or seeing a possibility of it, in the United States army, had fled to
</p>
<p>Canada to avoid the service. This class consisted mostly of fast young men, having
</p>
<p>either their own or the pockets of their parents well lined, and accustomed to live
</p>
<p>without labor of any kind, were not disposed to take a part on either side which
</p>
<p>would subject them to the inconveniences, hardships or privations of a soldier's
</p>
<p>life } and partly of persons who, while they sympathized with the rebellion, still
</p>
<p>did not care to make their precious bodies targets for the sake of upholding the I
</p>
<p>principles which they professed to entertain. 3d. Refugees, or persons who, for *
</p>
<p>the sake of expressing their opinions and feelings against the government, without I
</p>
<p>fear of imprisonment, had removed to Canada where they could vent their spleen I
</p>
<p>and malice against all things connected with the United States, and vaunt their I
</p>
<p>pernicious principles under the protection of the outstretched paw of the British I
</p>
<p>lion. 4th. Bounty jumpers and criminals who could not be pursued and brought"
</p>
<p>back to this country for punishment under the existing extradition treaty between^
</p>
<p>the United States and Canada. This last class exceeds by far all the others in?.'

</p>
<p>object  Rebel Officers and Soldiers drilling Copperheads in
</p>
<p>Southern Illinois and Indiana.
</p>
<p>It is the writer's intention to speak first of two expeditions to Chicago, for the
</p>
<p>release of the prisoners confined there. The first of these took place during the
</p>
<p>Chicago Democratic Convention, when it was hoped that the rebels from Canada
</p>
<p>and their sympathizers from Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, who came
</p>
<p>armed to assist them in their projects, would be enabled to go quietly into the
</p>
<p>city without fear of detection, in the vast crowds who were then assembling there,
</p>
<p>from all parts of the United States, and under the guise of friendly visitors, were
</p>
<p>to be ready at a moment's notice whenever their leaders called upon them to spring
</p>
<p>)ut before the people in their true light, and effect the release of those rebels con-
</p>
<p>Ined at Camp Douglas. As early as the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of August
</p>
<p>ast, at the request of Jacob Thompson, secretly and quietly circulated all through
</p>
<p>.he Canadas, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, all the Rebels, Skedaddlers,
</p>
<p>lefugees, and others who could be relied upon to take part in the expedition, began
</p>
<p>:> assemble in Toronto, Canada West, at the different hotels and boarding houses;
</p>
<p>f these, at that time, it was generally reported that there were about three hundred;
</p>
<p>ut so far as positive evidence goes, out of this number only about seventy-five
</p>
<p>en were induced to join this expedition and go to Chicago. At Toronto the
</p>
<p>oDJects of the expedition were made known to nearly all of them, and arms fur-
</p>
<p>nished them  arvis manufactured in New York city and shipped to Canada for
</p>
<p>that express pxirpose. The details of the affair were only known to a few of the
</p>
<p>leaders, who maintained the strictest silence upon the subject, and enjoined upon
</p>
<p>the men the most implicit obedience to their orders, pledging themselves for their
</p>
<p>safety and the feasibility of their plans. On the nights of the twenty-sixth,
</p>
<p>twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of August, these men began to leave Toronto,
</p>
<p>by all the different routes leading to Chicago, in squads of from two to ten, and
</p>
<p>began to arrive at the Richmond House in that city, as early as the Saturday before
</p>
<p>the Convention. They were all pledged to fight to the last, and never under any
</p>
<p>circumstances surrender, as their lives would be forfeited, if caught. The whole

</p>
<p>56 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>as Major-General in the Rebel army, to take effect and date from the release of the
</p>
<p>rebel prisoners of war at Rock Island or Camp Douglas. Hines is the person -who
</p>
<p>is said to have effected the escape of General John H. Morgan himself, and others
</p>
<p>from the penitentiary at Columbus, Ohio, and although it is not generally known
</p>
<p>in the North or South how Morgan escaped, and there not being one word of truth
</p>
<p>in his report, he has enjoyed for a long time the reputation of having been the
</p>
<p>author of it, and of being a desperate shrewd character. The real facts in the
</p>
<p>case were (and it does not do the service of the United States much credit to men-
</p>
<p>tion them,) that General John H. Morgan " was bribed out." It was absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary however for General Morgan to make some report of his escape to the
</p>
<p>public, that would hoodwink the United States Government and save the officers,
</p>
<p>whom his friends in the North had bribed to let him out, from punishment by the
</p>
<p>authorities, and therefore a very romantic tale was made up, and Morgan's pet
</p>
<p>Capt. Hines, was made the hero of it; and it was the object of the rebel govern-
</p>
<p>ment in sending Hines to Canada to give an air of truth to this romantic tale, to
</p>
<p>secure the United States officials who have failed in their duty to their country.
</p>
<p>Hines was assisted in his efforts by Col. St. Leger Grenfel an English adventurer
</p>
<p>of great military experience, personal bravery and daring, who has had a romantic
</p>
<p>connection with nearly every important war in America, Europe, Asia and Africa
</p>
<p>for the past thirty years, and served in the Southern army with the rank of Col.,
</p>
<p>as Adjt.-Gen. to Morgan, and afterwards on General Bragg's staff; but who pre-
</p>
<p>tended to have resigned his commission in the rebel army and was living quietly in
</p>
<p>Canada; also by one Capt. Castleman of Morgan's command, from Kentucky,
</p>
<p>who acted as Quartermaster of the party, and about seventy-five, rank and file,
</p>
<p>(nearly all of whom were officers) of the rebel army from Canada. These men
</p>
<p>were to be met here in Chicago by parties from nearly all the middle, western and
</p>
<p>border States, who came armed like themselves and for the same purpose. Of
</p>
<p>those citizens who came to Chicago, armed and ready like the rebels, there were over
</p>
<p>a thousand persons organized and officered, camped in this city, just waiting for the
</p>
<p>command, and there were in the vast throng then assembled in Chicago five or
</p>
<p>six thousand, who, while they would not attach themselves to any organization,
</p>
<p>and were afraid to risk the first attempt, yet if the first attempt had been successful
</p>
<p>they would have joined the others in their work of devastation and destruction.

<p>The above is most too low an estimate of the number of these malcontents who
</p>
<p>did not join any military organization, but would have eventually joined if it had

<p>been successful; for rebel officers have been heard to say in Canada, after the Con-

</p>
<p>to seize upon all the railroads and public buildings, and in the event they were not
</p>
<p>strong enough to hold all the country, they were to rally around the liberated rebels
</p>
<p>and their friends at Chicago, Camp Chase, Camp Morton, and other places, after
</p>
<p>destroying all the public works, railroads, etc., that would be of any service to the
</p>
<p>Government, in following them up, or baulking their movements. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time, however, the military authorities in Chicago had not been idle, and the rebels
</p>
<p>and their abettors looked with dismay upon every fresh arrival of troops and artil-
</p>
<p>lery, as it was reported in their headquarters by spies, who had the temerity to go
</p>
<p>to the observatory just opposite the camp, from which they could see almost all
</p>
<p>over it, and send up hourly reports of everything taking place inside.
</p>
<p>They not only had their spies, one might almost say, in Camp Douglas, but in
</p>
<p>the telegraph offices, and were in or so near Post Headquarters, that they were able
</p>
<p>to chronicle nearly every event of any importance to them, that transpired, in any
</p>
<p>of those places.
</p>
<p>On the third day of the Convention, it was announced from rebel headquarters
</p>
<p>at the Richmond House, that the expedition was a failure, that owing to the pre-
</p>
<p>cautions taken by the military authorities, and the non-arrival of a thousand or
</p>
<p>two of other Copperheads, who had promised to be in Chicago, ready to assist in the
</p>
<p>undertaking, and owing to the want of sufficient discipline and organization among
</p>
<p>the Copperheads, who were on hand, that an attempt at that time upon the gar-
</p>
<p>rison of Camp Douglas would involve the destruction of the lives of too many
</p>
<p>prisoners, and perhaps the killing and capturing of all those who made the attempt
</p>
<p>to release them. As soon as it was generally known among the rebels that they
</p>
<p>had failed in attaining the objects for which they came to Chicago, Col. Grenfell
</p>
<p>and Capt. Castleman made their appearance among them, and stated that it had
</p>
<p>been generally agreed upon that all who were willing should go to Southern Illinois
</p>
<p>and Indiana, to drill and organize the Copperheads for the coming struggle, which
</p>
<p>they thought would take place very soon, or in other words, as soon as Gen. Lee
</p>
<p>should have Gen. Grant's army in full retreat towards Washington city, or should
</p>
<p>have inflicted some other almost irreparable disaster upon the Union arms, which
</p>
<p>event both they and the Copperheads with them, were not only wishing to take
</p>
<p>place, but confidently expecting every day ; that they with Hines and others were

<p>going home with some delegates to the Convention, where they could live quietly
</p>
<p>and work to a great advantage.
</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the Convention, the men and officers were paid various
</p>
<p>sums from twenty to one hundred dollars, and it was left to their option whether
</p>
<p>they would go to Southern Illinois, Indiana, or return to Canada. Some fifteen or
</p>
<p>twenty went to Canada, and about fifty went to Southern Illinois and Indiana.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the first attempt to release the rebel prisoners of war at Camp Douglas.
</p>
<p>It was certainly a bold movement, both on the part of the rebels, who exposed
</p>
<p>themselves to such great risk of suffering a disgraceful and ignominous death, and
</p>
<p>the citizens who aided them in their nefarious designs. But it seemed that an

<p>At the time the rebel officers and soldiers left Chicago, after the Conventioc
</p>
<p>none of them had any idea of ever coming back again, except Capt. Hines and
</p>
<p>few of the leaders who consulted with him. He was shrewd enough to see tha;
</p>
<p>any effort at that time would be fruitless, and determined, so far as possible, tt
</p>
<p>have all the Copperheads who would assist him in any second affair of the kind
</p>
<p>drilled and organized, and men able to render effective assistance. It was for thi
</p>
<p>purpose that he, with his comrades, went to Southern Illinois and Indiana witl
</p>
<p>cavalry and infantry tactics and all the appliances for instructing others in military
</p>
<p>matters.
</p>
<p>The conspirators having failed at Chicago during the convention to make thei

</p>
<p>for thousands of others not quite so large, to burn up brightly from almost ever;

<p>hill-top in Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, it was necessary fo>

<p>these generals had several states partitioned off into districts and departments, o '
</p>
<p>which, each department commander was to have exclusive control.
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 61
</p>
<p>The new programme having been adopted, all that was necessary was to fix upon
</p>
<p>,he day. The day must be one upon which more than the usual number of visi-
</p>
<p>ors would be in the city, in order that their coming and staying would not be
</p>
<p>loticed, and it seemed they selected the day of election, as the one most suitable
</p>
<p>or their purposes ; and if possible a day when the military and civil authorities
</p>
<p>rould be most likely to be caught off their guard. For several days before the
</p>
<p>tth of November last, their spies had been coming into the city, in order to get
</p>
<p>uitable quarters for the men when they arrived, and in parts of the city where
</p>
<p>hey would be least liable to suspicion. In the efforts to secure suitable boarding
</p>
<p>louses for these incendiaries, various citizens of Chicago took an active part, and
</p>
<p>rven went to the depots to receive them, and escort them into the bosom of the
</p>
<p>dty they were so soon to attempt to destroy. It was not until the Saturday just
</p>
<p>>efore the election, that Gen. Sweet had positive information of the rebels being
</p>
<p>n the city, and received full information of the details of their plans, and began
</p>
<p>take measures quietly to capture them. This he did at once, and at the same
</p>
<p>imc had every preparation made to repel any attack upon the garrison of Camp
</p>
<p>)ouglas ; and he succeeded admirably, following up his information with such
</p>
<p>mergy, that before daylight of the Monday morning following, he had captured
</p>
<p>mough of the rebel leaders (and their friends in such connexion as to leave no
</p>
<p>loubt of their guilt,) to make every disloyal man quake in his boots. The
</p>
<p>aptures of the military and police were not confined alone to the conspirators,
</p>
<p>nd in addition to them were captured immense military stores of all kinds, boxes
</p>
<p>f guns already shotted, cart loads of army pistols loaded and ready for the bloody
</p>
<p>rork expected of them, holsters, pistol belts, cartridges by the cart load, and
</p>
<p>mough munitions of war to have started an arsenal of moderate size.
</p>
<p>These arms were not taken from the rebels, but found in the houses of citizens
</p>
<p>f Chicago, who can produce witnesses upon the stand (of pretended loyalty and
</p>
<p>tanding, some of them being office-holders under the Government, ) to swear
</p>
<p>hat they themselves are, and have always been loyal and true to their
</p>
<p>Jlegiance. In the house of Charles Walsh, most of these arms were taken,
</p>
<p>nd also there were captured two rebel soldiers, Captain George Cantrill and
</p>
<p>Jharles Travis Daniels, who were shortly after identified ; and Cantrill partly

<p>jttle incident, showing fully the kindred feelings existing between the conspirators

<p>Copperhead conspirators, to show their refinement of feeling, their accommodating

</p>
<p>Canada, occupying the geographical position and belonging to another
</p>
<p>nation as it does, has been ever since this war broke out, the rendezvous of thousands
</p>
<p>upon thousands of the vagabond and criminal population of the United States,
</p>
<p>together with the rebels and refugees, nntil its population far exceeds what it had
</p>
<p>in 1860 ; almost every business occupation is crowded to such an extent that it is
</p>
<p>almost impossible to obtain employment of any kind, many persons being obliged
</p>
<p>to keep from starving by begging, for their food, and the clothes they wear upon
</p>
<p>their backs. Some of this refugee population have means, others are supplied by
</p>
<p>their friends and families at home ; but by far the greater number are without any
</p>
<p>occupation or visible means of support, habitue of the gambling hells, drinking
</p>
<p>saloons, &c, in favor of any crime or villainy to supply their depleted purses, and
</p>
<p>furnish them with the means of living at ease and idleness. Under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances and among such a class of population, is it anything strange, that the
</p>
<p>robbery of banks, the pillaging of the inhabitants of the Northern border, that
</p>
<p>raids with all the necessary plundering and so forth, found plenty of advocates and
</p>
<p>supporters, and when the time arrived to carry them into execution, plenty of
</p>
<p>desperadoes, fit tools for such infamous projects. The great difficulty in Canada
</p>
<p>was not in getting enough of these men to participate in matters of this kind ; but
</p>
<p>to prevent too many of them from knowing of them, so that there would be a
</p>
<p>smaller number among whom to divide the spoils and plunder thus obtained, so
</p>
<p>that the chief difficulty lay in getting together just enough of the most desperate
</p>
<p>characters to carry out an expedition. During the Chicago Democratic Convention
</p>
<p>the efforts of the rebels were not confined alone to Camp Douglas ; but simultane-
</p>
<p>ously with their efforts in Chicago, they were to make an attempt to capture the
</p>
<p>United States Steamer Michigan, carrying eighteen guns, stationed on Lake Erie,
</p>
<p>the steamer permitted by the treaty between the United States and Great Britain,
</p>
<p>for the better protection of rebel prisoners confined at Johnston's Island.
</p>
<p>The prisoners of war at Chicago, Illinois, being released, and the great con-
</p>
<p>spiracy in the North once fairly inaugurated, the capture of the steamer Michigan

</p>
<p>64 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the conspiracy in overturning the authority of the United States Government.
</p>
<p>With the " Michigan " in their hands, the conspirators would have a powerful
</p>
<p>auxilliary in their pernicious designs upon the country, and be able to render'
</p>
<p>effective aid to the Southern Rebellion; ruining the commercial status of the
</p>
<p>United States on the great lakes, and effectually closing all the ports on their I
</p>
<p>borders, and in addition to this, their laying all the large towns and cities on the I
</p>
<p>northern portion under contributions, and exacting from them enormous sums of
</p>
<p>money, through fear of bombardment.
</p>
<p>The plan of the conspirators to get possession of the Michigan was by bribery
</p>
<p>and by surprise. Mr. Thompson, in his efforts to seize the vessel, secured the
</p>
<p>services of a man named Cole, of Sandusky City, who, whilom, had been a
</p>
<p>citizen of Virginia, but who still retained his sympathies for the rebellion, and
</p>
<p>took an active part in aiding it whenever he had an opportunity, and a woman,
</p>
<p>said to have been his paramour, who carried dispatches backwards and forwards
</p>
<p>between the parties. This man Cole seems to have been the most wiley conspira-
</p>
<p>tor of them all, and played his infamous part of the plot with the most adroit
</p>
<p>shrewdness; and the defeat of the whole scheme was not owing to any blunder of
</p>
<p>his, but rather the blunder of those who employed and furnished him with the
</p>
<p>means.
</p>
<p>Having been well supplied with money by Mr. Thompson, and no limit put to
</p>
<p>his expenses, he began his work with a will. He seems to have begun by getting
</p>
<p>generally well acquainted with the officers of the vessel, by feasting them, and
</p>
<p>now and then lending them money, or accommodating them in some other way,
</p>
<p>until he had won the confidence of all those in command of the steamer, as well as
</p>
<p>those in charge of Johnston's Island. After a time, he found out those who were
</p>
<p>most vulnerable on the money question, and those whom he did not dare to
</p>
<p>approach upon the subject. Of the latter class, there is one mentioned in partic-
</p>
<p>ular by the rebels, whose suspicions they did not care to arouse, and which they
</p>
<p>made every attempt to lull. This was an officer named Eddy, from Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>Of the former class, whom they bribed, the rebels mentioned particularly the chief
</p>
<p>engineer, who, they said, had agreed, for twenty thousand dollars in gold, to get
</p>
<p>the machinery out of order, and otherwise aid in the vessel's capture, and one or
</p>
<p>two others.
</p>
<p>Of the remainder of the officers of the Michigan, they thought their well-known

</p>
<p>Democratic faith and sympathy with the rebellion, would prevent them from seeing
</p>
<p>or knowing too much, until too late to avoid the disaster. Of these last, the con-
</p>
<p>spirators did not seem to entertatn the least fear, some of them being Southern
</p>
<p>men by birth, and at most, but passive] in their fidelity to the government. The
</p>
<p>men of the vessel who were loyal, were also tampered with, and the rebels in
</p>
<p>Canada looked for assistance from them, and claimed that some of their own men
</p>
<p>from Canada had enlisted on board of her for ^the purpose of aiding to capture
</p>
<p>her. Of these rebels, however, there were but few. As the writer has stated

<p>before, the attempt on the steamer Michigan was to be simultaneous with that at

</p>
<p>A citizen of Chicago, he was at one time the Democratic candidate for Sheriff of Cook County, in which is the
</p>
<p>city of Chicago, during the earliest part of the war he was very active in helping to raise what was called the Irish
</p>
<p>brigade. He afterwards became a bitter democratic partizan and was connected with the Sons of Liberty. Just
</p>
<p>before and during the Convention he received into his family several rebel soldiers who were there during the day
</p>
<p>and night time, making cartridges for the expected release of the rebel prisoners of war at Camp Douglas. He
</p>
<p>was arrested in his own house on the morning of the 7th of November, as was also his son, and two Kebel soldiers
</p>
<p>and taken to Camp Douglas. In his house and on his premises were an immense numbers of guns of several kinds
</p>
<p>and also immense military stores, consisting of powder, buckshot, cartridges, with two or three cast braces of army
</p>
<p>revolvers, all these guns and pistols were loaded and ready with the exception of being capped. Charles Walsh is
</p>
<p>cf Irish extraction and about forty years of age, and a fine looking man. He is generous, impulsive, rather easily
</p>
<p>influenced, agreeable in conversation, and except in the character he assumed as an enemy to his country was

</p>
<p>Chicago, 111., and while the rebels and their friends were assembling in Chicago,
</p>
<p>they were also gathering in Sandusky City, for the capture of the Michigan. The
</p>
<p>exact number of conspirators in Sandusky, at that time, is not known to the writer,
</p>
<p>nor the details of their plans ; but let it suffice to say, that they xoere there, armed
</p>
<p>and ready. When the time of action arrived, however, the engineer and his
</p>
<p>accomplices were no where to be found, and after waiting for nearly two days, thee
</p>
<p>rebel portion of the conspirators, with the exception of Capt. Beall, returned to:
</p>
<p>Canada. On their return, they said that the persons whom they had bribed werec
</p>
<p>afraid to toe the mark  that is, were afraid to carry out their infamous and haz-
</p>
<p>ardous part of the contract.
</p>
<p>The rebels were in great fear, lest something had happened that would put an endl
</p>
<p>forever to their hopes, in regard to the steamer, but in a few days after this, the;
</p>
<p>non-appearance of the engineer and friends, were duly explained, and the alarm i
</p>
<p>caused by it quieted, and another time set for the attempt ; the sequel will show
</p>
<p>how much they intended, and how much they ventured to effect their aims. It is-
</p>
<p>a well known fact that the rebels while in Sandusky city, were feasted and toasted!
</p>
<p>in the houses of some of the prominent citizens and business men, and encouraged!
</p>
<p>in every way by them. The day being set once more, preparations were again,
</p>
<p>made to capture the vessel, and this time occurred what was called the Lake Erie
</p>
<p>Piracy, nearly everything connected with which was so disgraceful to the United!
</p>
<p>States service, that although the government hastened to remove all the reprehen-
</p>
<p>sible officers, and retain those who deserved well of their country, yet seems to
</p>
<p>have endeavored to keep some of the facts connected with it, from being made
</p>
<p>public. About one week before the time set for the second attempt arrived, Capt.
</p>
<p>Beall returned from Sandusky to Windsor, Canada West, and announced that all
</p>
<p>was ready for the capture, and immediately telegraphed to Jacob Thompson, who
</p>
<p>was then at the Queen's Hotel, in Toronto, who at once answered that he would!
</p>
<p>come to Windsor that night, and desired not to be recognized. That evening he>
</p>
<p>arrived at Windsor, and without apparently being known got into a carriage wait-
</p>
<p>ing, and was taken to the residence of a Col. Steele, about a mile below Windsor, ^
</p>
<p>where he was expected. During this week all the men who were to pa*ticipate im
</p>
<p>the affair were notified, and this time the services of some of the men who had:
</p>
<p>been to Chicago during the Convention, were called into requisition. The officers-
</p>
<p>of the rebel army could be seen running about, here and there, to the differentl

<p>boarding houses where the men were stopping, carrying ominous looking carpett
</p>
<p>bags, distributing from them pistols, ammunition and other things, deemed I
</p>
<p>necessary for the undertaking, which was to be made on the night of the following |
</p>
<p>Monday. Most active in these efforts to incite these men to deeds of desperation,
</p>
<p>were Col. Steele and Jake Thompson or when he used his assumed name, Col.
</p>
<p>Carson.
</p>
<p>The plans of the pirates were as follows, and the writer gives them just as he
</p>
<p>heard them from the lips of two of the rebel officers who participated in the affair, ?
</p>
<p>commanding detachments on board of the " Philo Parsons." Part of the men,
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 67
</p>
<p>amounting in all to about seventy-five, were to go from Canada to Sandusky city
</p>
<p>by rail, another party were to cross the river at Detroit early on Monday morning,
</p>
<p>and take passage on the steamer " Philo Parsons" for Sandusky, another portion
</p>
<p>were to take passage on her from Sandwich, Canada, about two miles below Detroit,
</p>
<p>and still another party of them, consisting of about fifteen (with eight or ten
</p>
<p>citizens who knew nothing of what was contemplated), on Sunday morning were
</p>
<p>to charter a small steamer called the " Scotia," plying between Windsor and
</p>
<p>Detroit, ostensibly for the purpose of taking -a pleasu*) ride to Maiden, Canada,
</p>
<p>about twenty miles below Detroit, and near the entrance of the river into the lake,
</p>
<p>when they were also on Monday to take passage for the same place on the Parsons.
</p>
<p>At Kelley's Island, one of the points at which the boat touched in her daily trips,
</p>
<p>they were to receive a messenger from Cole, letting them know, that up to that time
</p>
<p>everything was going on smoothly in Sandusky; upon receiving this information,
</p>
<p>all the different portions of the gang were to unite and seize the steamer, before
</p>
<p>she reached the next landing, at which she generally stopped. The engineers and
</p>
<p>pilots were to be forced, by threats of instant death if they refused, to still occupy
</p>
<p>their respective places ; the passengers were to be put off at some out of the way
</p>
<p>place, where it would be impossible for them to give any information to the
</p>
<p>authorities, and after dark they were to run down into Sandusky bay, where they
</p>
<p>would see certain signals, made by those conspirators on the shore, when they
</p>
<p>would land, take on board all those who had come by rail from Detroit, and some
</p>
<p>Copperheads from Cincinnati, Ohio, and other places, and at once would imme-
</p>
<p>diately turn the prow of the Parson for the steamer Michigan. Cole was to give
</p>
<p>a champagne supper on board the Michigan that evening, to the officers, and was
</p>
<p>to be there himself with a party of rebels, who had also become well acquainted
</p>
<p>with the officers, and was invited at the request of Cole, to join in the festivities
</p>
<p>of the occasion. It was intended for the Philo Parsons to reach hailing distance
</p>
<p>of the Michigan about eleven or twelve o'clock that night, in order that by this
</p>
<p>time as many of the crew as possible, through the champagne, would be incapable
</p>
<p>uf rendering any resistance, when the Parson was hailed by the watch on board
</p>
<p>the steamer, and Cole and his associates were at once to take possession of a gun,
</p>
<p>which would sweep the whole decks, to prevent that portion of the crew who were
</p>
<p>not rendered incapable of it by drink, from attempting any effectual resistance to
</p>
<p>the conspirators boarding her from the Parsons. Once in possession of this vessel

<p>of war, the prisoners on the island were to be immediately released, landed at
</p>
<p>Sandusky, when the Sons of Liberty, Illini and other secret societies were to
</p>
<p>seize the opportunity of rising up, and asserting their peculiar doctrines, under the
</p>
<p>protection of this powerful man of war. The same course was to be pursued at
</p>
<p>Cleveland and other places, along the lake coast, where their secret societies were
</p>
<p>in full blast, the conspirators exacting an enormous tribute of the loyal portion of
</p>
<p>these communities to save their property from the dangers of bombardment. This
</p>
<p>expected tribute of ten millions of dollars, (to be divided equally among tbem,)
</p>
<p>;from the border cities, was the greatest inducement held out by the rebel leaders

<p>68 THE GREAT NORTH WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>before leaving Canada, to their desperadoes, in order to excite their cupidity anc
</p>
<p>zeal, and inflame their minds to such a pitch, that they would render a stric
</p>
<p>obedience to their officers, and hesitate at no act of violence.
</p>
<p>These were the plans of the conspirators, and although they may seem almos
</p>
<p>ideal and improbable, yet are very possible even to the most minute details, whei
</p>
<p>one will take time to stop and consider the great chances of success the pirates had
</p>
<p>in having a portion of the crew bribed, and their prospects of having the remain
</p>
<p>der too excited by liquor, \o make any effectual opposition  the surprise, the chao<
</p>
<p>and confusion of the crew at finding those whom they supposed their friends, a:
</p>
<p>well as their own comrades and fellow-soldiers, fighting them hand to hand.
</p>
<p>Under such circumstances as these, it is very easy to conceive of the capture a
</p>
<p>a vessel by a band of desperadoes, who would hesitate at no act of bloodshed o
</p>
<p>villainy to accomplish their objects. In addition to this, they were rendered mon
</p>
<p>desperate, if such a thing could be, by the certainty that if they failed and wen
</p>
<p>captured, a speedy and disgraceful deatlfawaited them.
</p>
<p>The Michigan being captured, it is also easy to conceive that all the other poi
</p>
<p>tions of their plans could have been carried out, perhaps to a greater extent thai
</p>
<p>already mentioned, that contributions could have been levied and exacted from th
</p>
<p>people, and especially that the Sons of Liberty and other secret societies woul
</p>
<p>joyously seize such an opportunity as the protection of this man-of-war afforded there
</p>
<p>to throw off the mantle of secrecy and darkness from their hell-born principle!
</p>
<p>and parade them to the view of the public in all their hideousness.
</p>
<p>We will now follow up the plans of the conspirators, and mention the facts a
</p>
<p>they occurred. On Sunday the  tn of September, just preceding the attemp-
</p>
<p>although it was a rainy and very disagreeable day, in accordance with orders, th
</p>
<p>Scotia was chartered and conveyed her part of the pirates, together with some arm
</p>
<p>to Maiden, C. W. It is due to the citizens who were with the pirates, to say here
</p>
<p>that they had no idea that the piracy was contemplated, and thought that it w
</p>
<p>only a fishing excursion, which at that time was a very common occurrence wit
</p>
<p>the Southeners at Windsor.
</p>
<p>That evening when the Scotia returned, they alleged that it was so unpleasai
</p>
<p>that they would wait until the next day before going back to Windsor, in this wa
</p>
<p>lulling everything like suspicion in the minds of those who had only been invite
</p>
<p>to go with them, the more effectually to conceal the real objects of the pirates.

<p>Monday, on the arrival of the Steamer Philo Parsons at Maiden, those who ha
</p>
<p>taken passage from Detroit and Sandwich, were seen in very conspicuous places c
</p>
<p>the decks, by those on the wharf, who immediately boarded her in the capacity <
</p>
<p>passengers. It was not the intention of the pirates to seize the vessel until neari
</p>
<p>to Sandusky, and in the event they received no messenger from Cole, at Kelleys
</p>
<p>Island, they were not to take possession of her at all, but continue in their chara:
</p>
<p>ters as passengers to Sandusky, and there learn the cause of his failure to comnv
</p>
<p>nicate with them. But as subsequent events will show, they were compelled i
</p>
<p>change their whole plan of operations. Shortly after the vessel left Maiden, tl

</p>
<p>frequency with which all of these men patronized the bar of the boat, attracted the
</p>
<p>suspicions of some of the passengers, as well as the officers, one of whom, from
</p>
<p>some remarks let fall by one of the men, thought they were a suspicious set, and said
</p>
<p>that tis soon as the boat arrived at Sandusky, he would have them arrested and
</p>
<p>taken care of. Some of the pirates happened to hear this remark, and as soon as
</p>
<p>it was generally known, created the greatest consternation among them, and upon
</p>
<p>arriving at Kelley's Island and not receiving the messenger promised by Cole, they
</p>
<p>were in a very unenviable position. To go to Sandusky they would be arrested;
</p>
<p>the only course they could take to save their own lives and liberty, was that which
</p>
<p>they eventually adopted.
</p>
<p>Capt. Beall, after hearing this report, quickly determined to seize the vessel, which
</p>
<p>was accordingly done, to the great terror of the passengers and crew. One or two
</p>
<p>of the crew who refused to obey the orders given by the pirates, were severely
</p>
<p>wounded. Finding that there was only wood enough on board to last for a short
</p>
<p>time, she was run to Put-in-bay to get a supply, and it was at this landing that they
</p>
<p>seized the Island Queen, which happened to be there also, for the same purpose.
</p>
<p>This vessel, after removing her valuables, was immediately scuttled and left floating
</p>
<p>with the current in a sinking condition. After dark that night, the pirates ran
</p>
<p>down into Sandusky Bay, but failing to see the signals agreed upon, and after wait-
</p>
<p>ing a short time, again returned to the open lake, convinced by this time that some-
</p>
<p>(fching had happened to their friends in Sandusky. Capt. Beall then seeing that
</p>
<p>something hnd happened which would prevent them from capturing the Michigan,
</p>
<p>announced his determination to cruise on the lake as long as possible, burning and
</p>
<p>destroying all he could, and endeavored to induce his men to go with him ; but
</p>
<p>they were already scared, and begun to fear the consequences of their act, and
</p>
<p>insisted upon going back to Canada. This is what Capt. Beall himself told Mr.
</p>
<p>Thompson on his return to Canada, that " if it had not been for these mutinous
</p>
<p>scoundrels, I could have run that boat on these lakes for two weeks, burning and
</p>
<p>destroying all the vessels we met with, before the Yankees could have made us take
</p>
<p>to land."
</p>
<p>The owners of shipping upon the great lakes, can now if they never could before,
</p>
<p>appreciate fully the danger to their vessels at that time. The day before the rebels
</p>
<p>left Windsor, C. W., the United States authorities had been notified of the expedi-
</p>
<p>tion, and fully placed upon their guard, and if the plans of Lieut. Col. Hill, the

</p>
<p>efficient commander of the post at Detroit could have been followed, he would have
</p>
<p>captured the whole gang. However, he telegraphed to Sandusky, and had Cole
</p>
<p>arrested while he was sitting at the^table, taking dinner with the officers on board
</p>
<p>the Michigan. This effectually prevented Cole from communicating with the con-
</p>
<p>spirators. Col. Hill's plans were to let the pirates take the Parsons, and then before
</p>
<p>they had time to do any damage, have the Michigan meet them on their way to
</p>
<p>Sandusky and capture them all together, and thus releive the Government from any
</p>
<p>farther trouble with this most desperate band of incendaries. Col. Hill telegraphed
</p>
<p>to the commander of the Michigan, requesting him to do this, and it is generally
</p>
<p>70 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>understood that the reason why he did not do it was that the machinery of the
</p>
<p>vessel was out of order, thus showing how well those who had been bribed had
</p>
<p>done their duty.
</p>
<p>In addition to these attempts to capture the steamer Michigan, was the cele-
</p>
<p>brated St. Albans raid, which among others, was one of the rebel modes of carrying
</p>
<p>the war into Africa and harrassing the northern border.
</p>
<p>This raid, which has become so famous in the history of this war, was first
</p>
<p>started by a Texan, named Bracey, belonging to one of the rebel Texan regiments.
</p>
<p>This man, for four or five years before the war, had been going to one of the
</p>
<p>schools or colleges (according to his own account of himself,) in St. Albans, and
</p>
<p>was well acquainted, both with the city and country, in the immediate neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood. He gave all the information he could, and offered to return there to get
</p>
<p>more, which he, with one or two rebel soldiers did, and obtained all the necessary
</p>
<p>information that would, in any way, aid them in their criminal designs. Upon
</p>
<p>their report, on their return to Canada, the fitting out the expedition immediately
</p>
<p>began  the money, arms, etc., being furnished by the rebel agents in Montreal or
</p>
<p>Quebec. Of the details of this affair, as carried out, the people have been fully
</p>
<p>advised by the newspapers, and, to all intents and purposes, the raid has been a
</p>
<p>success, or has operated in this manner by the winding and twisting course of the
</p>
<p>Canadian law courts, which seem to be actuated by no fixed principles, but waver-
</p>
<p>ing between the fear of the public opinion of the American people, and their desire
</p>
<p>to aid the rebels in overturning the government  and had it not been for the
</p>
<p>sudden turn the war has taken in the last six months, the people along the
</p>
<p>northern border would have been subjected to numerous other and similar raids.
</p>
<p>The St. Albans raid was only a part of one grand scheme of the rebels, for the
</p>
<p>past two years, to inaugurate a new mode of warfare, entirely beyond the pale of
</p>
<p>that waged by civilized nations, and a relic of the more barbarous ages. This
</p>
<p>new mode of warfare, or incendiarism, as it is generally called, was first started
</p>
<p>by the rebel government, after the fall of Memphis, Tenn., for the purpose of
</p>
<p>destroying vessels, loaded with government property, and cut off the communica-
</p>
<p>tions of the armies in the lower countries, with their depots of supplies ; with this
</p>
<p>end in view, companies of men were regularly enlisted for the purpose, and after:
</p>
<p>a time, the sympathies and the aid rendered the rebellion by certain classes of the
</p>
<p>people at the North, justified them in extending its pernicious effects further:

<p>North. Companies were enlisted and sent through the lines, with orders to burni
</p>
<p>public buildings, army stores, and supplies, wherever they could find them. Thus
</p>
<p>far, secret agents of the rebels were scattered all over the North, in small squads,
</p>
<p>wherever there was a prospect of doing injury to the government; and it is to the
</p>
<p>efforts of these men, that the country is indebted for the wholesale destruction of
</p>
<p>steamboat and other property at St. Louis, Cairo, and other places on the western
</p>
<p>rivers. These men performing the incendiary acts frequently upon information
</p>
<p>furnished them by their sympathizing friends. The public are already well aware

<p>of the manner in which some of these acts of incendiarism terminated, moat

</p>
<p>fully appreciate the enormity of his crime. One, knowing the facts of these men

<p>being in the North for this purpose, can readily appreciate the punishment awarded

<p>them; but upon reviewing ali the facts in the case, will as readily say that they

</p>
<p>ARMS UPON OUR STREETS.
</p>
<p>The evening of the 3d of November, 1864, found a large representation of the
</p>
<p>Sons of Liberty in their lodge room in Chicago, for as the time drew near for the
</p>
<p>Presidential election  the period fixed for the carnival of crime  the members of
</p>
<p>the organization realized the importance of the utmost vigilance  lest their plans
</p>
<p>should be discovered  and of the most entire concurrence with their leaders, and
</p>
<p>concert of action in obeying the commands that might be given. At this meet-
</p>
<p>ing, the Brigadier-General of the Order was present, as were also Captains and
</p>
<p>Lieutenants of the Invincible Club, and a more exciting meeting had rarely ever
</p>
<p>been held in the Temple. Speakers were vehement and earnest, and their theme
</p>
<p>was the proposed uprising. As had ever been their policy, certain important
</p>
<p>facts were withheld from the fledglings in treason, who had not yet tried their
</p>
<p>wings, but there was no discord, no dissention, and all exhibited enthusiasm and
</p>
<p>confidence. Brig.-Gen. Walsh called a meeting of the Order, to be held in the
</p>
<p>hall of the Invincible Club, on Sunday evening November 6th, the hour being
</p>
<p>fixed for eight o'clock. All were exhorted to be " on hand," as the Brig.-General
</p>
<p>had an important communication to make.
</p>
<p>Friday and Saturday an immense number of pistols, and much ammunition
</p>
<p>were sold, and many were given away in quarters, where it was certain material aid
</p>
<p>might be expected, when the time should arrive for the inauguration of revolution.
</p>
<p>To the few of us having the interests of the country at heart, who were cognisant
</p>
<p>of the acts, preparations and intentions of the Order, it will readily be believed
</p>
<p>the days were tedious, and the nights sleepless. So well had the principal secrets
</p>
<p>of the Order  the details of the uprising  been kept from the lower degree of
</p>
<p>the " Sons," that but few of the members had a definite idea of the infamous
</p>
<p>part they were expected to perform, and it was to communicate enough informa-
</p>
<p>tion to secure harmony among the men, and that concert of action which promised
</p>
<p>the most complete success of the terrible scheme of villainy before them, that

<p>the meeting was called for Sabbath evening. It will be seen by the report of

<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 73
</p>
<p>Gen. Sweet's testimony, before the military commission, to what peril the city
</p>
<p>was exposed. With but a handful of men to garrison the post, without the ability
</p>
<p>to obtain adequate reinforcements, with ten thousand veteran rebels in a camp, so
</p>
<p>incomplete in its structure, with the certainty that our secret enemies were upon
</p>
<p>the railroads already, and seeking positions in the post-office, in telegraph offices,
</p>
<p>if, as there was good reason to apprehend, the telegraph stations were not already
</p>
<p>under their control, that by Judge Morris' official report to the Temple, two full
</p>
<p>regiments of Sons of Liberty, all well armed and disciplined, were ready at an
</p>
<p>hour's notice, and that a third regiment was almost complete, the knowledge also
</p>
<p>that the entire body of Copperheads in the State, and in the northwest, would rise
</p>
<p>simultaneously with the traitors in our city, with good reason to believe it impossi-
</p>
<p>ble to safely communicate with the head of the State military department  in this
</p>
<p>most enenviable position, to know that the fatal moment was fast coming, when
</p>
<p>the infernal machinery was to be set in motion, and to make arrangements to avert
</p>
<p>the catasrophe so quietly as not to arrest attention, or excite the alarm of the
</p>
<p>leaders of the plot, which would have instantly been executed, had it become
</p>
<p>apparent that the movements of these traitors were watched ; these considerations

<p>could then hope to avert the danger, occupied the mind and hands of the com-
</p>
<p>mandant of the post, and employed the utmost vigilance of the writer and able
</p>
<p>assistants. Every few hours orderlies and special couriers were despatched to the
</p>
<p>headquarters of the camp, with such reports as could be obtained. We have read
</p>
<p>Eastern tales of travelers, when accident had discovered them in closest proximity
</p>
<p>to the deadly cobra de capello, the breathless horror with which they contemplated
</p>
<p>its motions, and saw it slowly coiling itself upon their limbs, or upon a table at
</p>
<p>their bedsides, and knowing that a single motion on the part of the imperilled
</p>
<p>person would be but to invite certain death, the vigilance and eager solicitude, the
</p>
<p>distressing anxiety with which they regarded the movements and intent of the
</p>
<p>venomous creature, but never till a full realization of our position in regard to
</p>
<p>this organized band of traitors, did we ever experience sensations akin to those
</p>
<p>of the unfortunate traveler; and when the loathsome reptile had got into a position
</p>
<p>where it was safe to attempt its destruction, and when this attempt was successful,
</p>
<p>no greater relief or deeper emotions of gratitude could have been felt by him  a

<p>when the danger had been averted.
</p>
<p>Sunday evening came. Our citizens worshiping in the churches, or in peaceful
</p>
<p>repose in their own residences, little knew of the imminent peril to which they
</p>
<p>were exposed, or of the gathering of their fellow citizens in the Invincible Club
</p>
<p>Hall to arrange the details which, if successful, would bring ruin, desolation and
</p>
<p>death to thousands of our unsuspecting people. Up the entrance to the hall,
</p>
<p>cautiously crept the members of the order, peering behind them, and advancing
</p>
<p>one by one, or in groups of two or three, till they reached the hall. The door
</p>
<p>was guarded by a sentinel, so that intrusion was out of the question. At nine
</p>
<p>74 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>o'clock, the assemblage was called to order by Obadiah Jackson, Jr., Esq., the
</p>
<p>Grand Seignior. Patrick Booley, Secretary, was in his place on the right of the
</p>
<p>Grand Seignior. The meeting was large, and a more desperate looking collection
</p>
<p>of men have rarely assembled in a convention in our city. Such desecration of
</p>
<p>the evening of the Sabbath has never before been witnessed heie. After the
</p>
<p>opening of the meeting, one of the members took early occasion to remark sub-
</p>
<p>stantially, that it must have been noticed by all present, as well as himself, that
</p>
<p>the city was full of strangers, and that he had noticed many of them were dressed
</p>
<p>in butternut clothes, and had good reason to believe that they were Abolitionists
</p>
<p>in disguise ; that it was advisable to watch them, it being his confident opinion
</p>
<p>that they had come to the city for the purpose of fraudulently voting the Aboli-
</p>
<p>tion ticket; and the speaker was proceeding in this strain, much to the amusement
</p>
<p>of the members of the higher degree, to whom the men in butternut clothes were
</p>
<p>no strangers. The speaker had scarcely taken his seat, when James A. Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, Past Grand Seignior, rose and stated that the suspicious looking persons were
</p>
<p>" our friends," and that he himself had brought a company of sixty of them to
</p>
<p>the city, and that they were entitled to every attention, as they would do good
</p>
<p>service for " us," and stated that he was going back for more.
</p>
<p>The strangers who were the subject of discussion, were from the counties in the
</p>
<p>Southern part of the State, and all bore the same general appearance of vagabonds,
</p>
<p>cut-throats, felons, bounty -jumpers and deserters. They had all seemed to appear
</p>
<p>simultaneously in our city, unheralded even to the " Sons," and their advent was as
</p>
<p>much a subject of remark, as would have been a shower of toads and tadpoles. They
</p>
<p>did not take up their quarters at respectable hotels and private houses, but sneaked
</p>
<p>away stealthily to the lowest dens of vice, and resorts of criminals unwhipped of jus-
</p>
<p>tice. They came to help perform infamous work, and had a part of the price of their
</p>
<p>guilt upon their persons, or had already invested it for the poorest quality of
</p>
<p>intoxicating liquors. They had been collected together from the various country
</p>
<p>towns in the Southern part of the State, where they had been in training under
</p>
<p>the command of rebel officers, and many of them were the same parties who had
</p>
<p>come to Chicago at the time of the Democratic National Convention, hopeful and
</p>
<p>confident of the uprising, and who had been so wofully disappointed, and turned
</p>
<p>their backs so reluctantly upon our banks and stores, from which they had intended
</p>
<p>to glut their avarice, and amply remunerate themselves with the property of our

<p>citizens. Nothing on earth is more positively certain than, had the work not been
</p>
<p>arrested at the moment it was, these devils would have pillaged every bank and
</p>
<p>rifled every storehouse in Chicago; and it is equally certain that beyond Colonel
</p>
<p>Sweet and the writer, with his assistant, Robert Alexander, none knew of the
</p>
<p>intricate deadly plot in detail, although Major-General Hooker, Brig.-Gen. Paine,
</p>
<p>Governor Yates, Hon. I. N. Arnold, and William Rand, Esq., of the Tribune,
</p>
<p>had been informed by the writer of the general intent of the organization.

</p>
<p>Wilkinson not being satisfactory to Mr. Hull, some curt remarks were banded

</p>
<p>between the speakers, which Obadiah Jackson, Jr., Esq., the Grand Seignior
</p>
<p>could not well control, Brig.-Gen. Charlie Walsh rose to his feet and said
</p>
<p>unhesitatingly, that he had by his own order " brought these men here to vote and
</p>
<p>tofiijht" and he added, " by God they will vote early and often, and they will
</p>
<p>fight." Gen. Walsh desired that all the " brethren" would extend the hospitalities
</p>
<p>of the city to the visitors, for they were " our friends." While this discussion was
</p>
<p>going on, there was a Confederate officer in the hall, and within ten feet of Walsh.
</p>
<p>The joy upon the announcement by Walsh, found expression in a rude and boister-
</p>
<p>ous manner. It having been definitely settled that the wretches who had been the
</p>
<p>subject of discussion were good for any number of votes, and fully prepared to take
</p>
<p>part in the attack, so soon to startle our city ; the convention proceeded to ascertain
</p>
<p>who among its members were unarmed, and to supply such delinquents forthwith.
</p>
<p>The members generally exhibited revolvers of various patterns, but upon inspection
</p>
<p>by the officers, preference was expressed for the pattern like those which were
</p>
<p>subsequently found in the house of Walsh, by the officers, at the time of his arrest.
</p>
<p>There were several who had not the approved pattern, and such persons were
</p>
<p>instructed to apply next morning at the store of James Geary, corner of Wells and
</p>
<p>Madison streets, and they would be supplied, but upon consultation it was remarked
</p>
<p>by Geary, that as he was already suspected he feared it would hardly be expedient
</p>
<p>for Walsh to send arms to him for distribution, and it was agreed by J. II . Hub-
</p>
<p>bard, the treasurer of the Invincible Club, that he would receive possession of the
</p>
<p>revolvers, and give them to all who might apply, and such persons were to call at
</p>
<p>the door of the Invincible Club hall, at 9 o'clock the next morning, when they
</p>
<p>would be supplied. It was arranged that a guard of not less than fifty or one
</p>
<p>hundred men, all well armed, should remain all day on Tuesday, (election day,) at
</p>
<p>the polls in each ward, making not less than one full regiment in the aggregate,
</p>
<p>thus detailed for special " service."
</p>
<p>To distinguish friends and members at a time when trouble should break out,
</p>
<p>was a subject now raised for debate, and it was finally agreed that the members
</p>
<p>should wear McClellan badges upon the left breast, attached by red and white rib-
</p>
<p>bons. It was understood that orderlies were to be constantly reporting from each
</p>
<p>ward at the headquarters of Gen. Walsh, and thus a regular line of communication
</p>
<p>would be kept up, which in case of trouble, would be greatly to the advantage of
</p>
<p>these ruffians. They were all advised to deposit their vote with one hand, and

<p>present their revolver with the other. It was confidently asserted by individuals,
</p>
<p>but with how much truth we know not, that an Invincible Club from Philadelphia,
</p>
<p>would also be present and help do the voting, but as no Philadelphia Roughs were
</p>
<p>reported in the city, the help expected from Philadelphia probably did not arrive.

<p>many others.

</p>
<p>Before the morning of Monday, November 7th dawned, a dispatch, embracing
</p>
<p>the most important features of the Sunday night meeting, had been prepared by
</p>
<p>the writer, and forwared to the commandant of Camp Douglas, who, during the
</p>
<p>night, arrested Judge Morris, Brig.-Gen. Charles Walsh, and others, and a large
</p>
<p>number of " butternuts," who had been the subject of discussion at the Sunday
</p>
<p>night meeting, and these prisoners were safely lodged in Camp Douglas. The
</p>
<p>news of the arrests, and the charges upon which they were made, caused intense
</p>
<p>excitement among all classes, loyal men rejoicing for the promptness and wisdom
</p>
<p>of the measure, while the Copperheads howled fearfully, and denounced it as a
</p>
<p>fresh evidence of "Lincoln's tyranny." As the facts became generally known,
</p>
<p>there was an unanimous expression of approval on the part of all good, loyal
</p>
<p>citizens. The consternation of the Copperheads was truly great ; they felt that,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding their many precautions for secresy, the eye of the government
</p>
<p>had been upon them in their most secret places, and this consternation was not by
</p>
<p>any means relieved when they read in the morning papers an extract of Brig.-Gen.
</p>
<p>Charles "Walsh's speech before the order in the Invincible Club hall. They felt
</p>
<p>certain that they were watched, and that they were under careful espionage, and
</p>
<p>the effect was precisely what we had expected and desired. It was telegraphed
</p>
<p>in every direction, that the government had a complete knowledge of their designs
</p>
<p>and proceedings, and such a tremor and quaking with fear the Copperheads had
</p>
<p>not previously exhibited. It completely deranged their designs, and caused an
</p>
<p>utter abandonment of the plot, for the leaders in Chicago having been arrested,
</p>
<p>no one knew how soon his turn would come, and it is a general and well-estab
</p>
<p>lished fact, that however sanguinary and fiendish a rabble may prove when attack-
</p>
<p>ing their victims by surprise, the mass of such beings lose their brute courage
</p>
<p>when discovering, to a certainty, that the details of their strategy are known, and
</p>
<p>the party upon whom an assault is contemplated is prepared, and will repel the

</p>
<p>death to many of the assailants. They lack zeal, because they know their cause
</p>
<p>is a bad one, just as one honest man will put three rogues to flight. It was tel-
</p>
<p>egraphed that the heads of the government were fully advised of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and that officers were freely visiting all the more important temples in the North-
</p>
<p>West, mingling in the "business" of these meetings, and apprising the military
</p>
<p>leaders of every move which had been made, which was being made, and which
</p>
<p>was contemplated. Suspicion was aroused, and so general did this distrust soon
</p>
<p>become, that no one was willing to trust his neck in a halter, and any one of his
</p>
<p>associates having possession of the other end. Suddenly a most wonderful reform
</p>
<p>was apparent, as rats disappear from view after a few have been captured. Those
</p>
<p>who were at Invincible Club hall, and made secession speeches, declared they
</p>
<p>were all drunk, or were not in earnest, and other equally flimsy excuses;  these
</p>
<p>are the apologies members made to each other, presuming they were addressing
</p>
<p>the party who had surrendered them to the government. It was amusing to notice
</p>
<p>their trepidation. They were variously affected. Capt. P. D. Parks, of the Invin-
</p>
<p>cible Club, really cried, like a whipped schoolboy, from fear ; many ran away with
</p>
<p>all possible speed. Doolittle, the man of valor, who was to lead a party against
</p>
<p>Camp Douglas, was the first to run away, and from certain " surface indications,"
</p>
<p>we rather think he is running yet. James A. Wilkinson, the valorous Past Grand
</p>
<p>Seignior, has gone to look after Doolittle ; Silver has gone to Canada ; Strawn has
</p>
<p>turned a summerset into the Republican party ; S. Corning Judd helped to con-
</p>
<p>vict the prisoners in Cincinnati, although called by the defense ; Amos Green,
</p>
<p>the Major-General of the Order in Illinois, has quietly subsided, and is no longer
</p>
<p>belligerent ; Vallandigham gives the Order the cold-shoulder, and affects pious
</p>
<p>horror upon the recital of its aims and purposes  and, indeed, the whole organ-
</p>
<p>ization, as formidable as it was in numbers, was soon in the most terrible condition,
</p>
<p>and died in great agony. The complications of the disease of which the order
</p>
<p>came to its death, would puzzle the most profound pathologist. It might, per-
</p>
<p>haps, be set down as a disease of the heart, induced by corrupt morals, with the
</p>
<p>following complications : Softening of the brain from the study of State sove-
</p>
<p>reignty ; extreme nervous debility from the reproach of a guilty conscience ; injury
</p>
<p>to the spine by suddenness of fall ; weakness of the limbs from bad whiskey, and
</p>
<p>impurity of the blood from contamination. The child of secession is dead  as
</p>
<p>dead as the cause of the Southern Confederacy ! Jeff. Davis' pet institution was

<p>decently buried within the enclosure of Camp Douglas. There being no provision
</p>
<p>or service in the ritual for this occasion, we may only exclaim, as we look upon
</p>
<p>his last resting-place, " Requiescat in pace."
</p>
<p>The arrest of General Walsh and others, and the discovery of a great number
</p>
<p>of revolvers, etc., all loaded and ready for use, and the rather unpleasant discovery
</p>
<p>that the Brigadier-General had actually employed a Government detective to go to
</p>
<p>his house and give instructions in making cartridges, were rather mortifying to
</p>
<p>the order, and when it appeared that the Chairman of the Vigilance Committee,
</p>
<p>whose province was to take the balance of the arms, which we learned were in

<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 79
</p>
<p>Walsh's barn, and with all possible haste remove them to a place of safety, and
</p>
<p>the Chairman (who makes this record for the edification of his constituents),
</p>
<p>deemed the safest place he could find the retired locality of Camp Douglas, and if
</p>
<p>the inquisitive eyes of Gen. Sweet, and his grasping propensities, should take pos-
</p>
<p>session of all the valuable carbines, Enfield rifles, muskets and revolvers, let them
</p>
<p>moderate their wrath, and find consolation in the thought that in their last hour
</p>
<p>it will be a pleasant reflection that all those bristling warlike implements fell into
</p>
<p>the hands of men who will not put them to base uses.
</p>
<p>When it was announced, with all confidence, that beneath the hay in Charley
</p>
<p>Walsh's barn was a large number of firearms that must be speedily removed, a
</p>
<p>new idea of the value of ladies' hoops burst upon the world (not " The Wide-
</p>
<p>Wide World,") but the few who were present when James L. Rock, one of the
</p>
<p>editors of the Chicago Times announced that his wife (and Mr. Rock ought to
</p>
<p>know), and some other ladies could quickly remove these weapons by concealing
</p>
<p>them under their hoops, Colonel Sweet, with his usual gallantry, spared the ladies
</p>
<p>the inconvenience and trouble, and removed them quite as well and as quickly.
</p>
<p>After the first arrests, other followed, but after a time many of these worthies
</p>
<p>were liberated, not because of their innocence; and they may now one and all
</p>
<p>consider themselves on their good behavior.
</p>
<p>After the first arrests, the hall of the " Temple" in Chicago was deserted. It
</p>
<p>was not thught to be exactly safe, and meetings were held occasionally wherever
</p>
<p>they could find a place of safety, where it was morally certain Gen. Sweet would
</p>
<p>not know of their gatherings or of their business, and where it would be a dead
</p>
<p>secret forever; and they one and all swore that whoever had exposed them to the
</p>
<p>Government should die i>y assassination. This was their fixed purpose, and when
</p>
<p>suspicion fastened upon Hull, no less than three persons volunteered to do the deed,
</p>
<p>those men were Lewis C. Morrison, old Felton, the Outside Guardian, and, by his
</p>
<p>own confession, detective of the order, and James L. Rock, one of the editors o
</p>
<p>the Chicago Times.
</p>
<p>Two of these " gentlemen" visited the office of the writer of this book during
</p>
<p>the progress of the trial, and used the following language. " If it be true, (he
</p>
<p>having inferred from Alexander's testimony that the writer had been in the in-
</p>
<p>terest of the General Government), a thousand times you had better be Charley
</p>
<p>Walsh than Dr. Ayer."

<p>A project was considered to rally the order and carry out the original pro-

<p>Gentlemen who, by request, visited the different sections of the State and of

<p>the Northwest, all reported that immediately after it was known that the Govern-

<p>ment knew their secrets as well as they did themselves, they tacitly agreed not to

<p>regard themselves as a " secret" organization in future, and we have the best of
</p>
<p>reasons to believe the entire order is so completely uprooted that it can never

<p>again spring up to curse the land. Home traitors have been taught, and it is
</p>
<p>well if they profit by the lesson, they cannot form any society or order based

<p>upon treason, that can for any considerable time continue " secret." Its purposes
</p>
<p>will transpire, for the all-seeing eye of Him who reads the hearts of men, and
</p>
<p>will not suffer " a sparrow to fall to the ground without his notice," that God who
</p>
<p>hath decreed that this nation shall be re-united, shall be prosperous, free, happy,
</p>
<p>and truly great, will not suffer traitors to be successful, but will give them into
</p>

<p>^%?OeSTIM'ONY op Gen. B. J. Sweet  List of Officers and Members

<p>jf^U OF THE McCLELLAN CLUBS IN CHICAGO.
</p>
<p>The services of Brig.-Gen. B. J. Sweet, in relation to the Northwestern
</p>
<p>Conspiracy, have already been briefly mentioned, and the reader will per-
</p>
<p>haps find the report of that officer's testimony full of interest. After the
</p>
<p>eommunications by the writer to Gen. Sweet (then Colonel) in command of Camp
</p>
<p>Douglas, which were made by request of Gen. Paine, dispatches were regularly
</p>
<p>forwarded to that officer, who never failed to receive them with gratification. The
</p>
<p>service was one of extreme danger, difficulty and delicacy, requiring the most
</p>
<p>eareful attention, unceasing vigilance, and only the consciousness of discharging
</p>
<p>an important and imperative duty to the country, and the confident belief that
</p>
<p>invaluable aid might thus be rendered, could have induced the writer to enter
</p>
<p>npon and pursue a line of service, a thousand times more distasteful and perilous
</p>
<p>than active service upon the field.
</p>
<p>The recognition of the writer's services by Brig.-Gen. Paine, and subsequently
</p>
<p>by Maj. Gen. Hooker, in commendatory letters, will ever be remembered, showing
</p>
<p>as it did, a grateful appreciation by those gallant officers, of services of which,
</p>
<p>from their character, the public could have no knowledge for the time being.
</p>
<p>The following is the testimony of Gen. Sweet, as substantially given before the
</p>
<p>military commission in Cincinnati :
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE OF COLONEL SWEET.
</p>
<p>My name is Benjamin J. Sweet ; I am and was, during the months of September, October,
</p>
<p>and November of last year, Colonel of the 8th Regiment Veteran Reserve Corps ; I was also,
</p>
<p>and still am, Commandant of the Tost of Chicago, including Camp Douglas. The post I
</p>
<p>command extended, I suppose to the limits of the surrounding posts.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate.  What are the geographical limits of the command of the Post of
</p>
<p>Chicago.
</p>
<p>Mr. A say objected to the question, as involving a matter of law and not of evidence, but
</p>
<p>hia objection was overruled by the Court.
</p>
<p>Witness continued.  My jurisdiction extends to the limits of the posts north at Madison,
</p>
<p>Wisconsin, southwest to Rock Island, south, or almost south, to Springfield, and east to
</p>
<p>Detroit, Michigan. The Commandant has jurisdiction over everything pertaining to mili-
</p>
<p>tary affairs in the jurisdiction, over the command of all troops, and for the protection of!
</p>
<p>ffce property of the Government and of the people. Chicago is one of the first military

<p>depots of supplies in the country. There are ten depots in charge of a Colonel, and Chicago
</p>
<p>is one of them. The Depot Quartermaster at that time was Colonel Potter. From the com-
</p>
<p>mencement to the latter end of August, the number of troops under my command, fit for
</p>
<p>duty, was from 800 to 900. Towards the end of August, I was reinforced by about 1,200
</p>
<p>men, consisting of four companies of one hundred days' men, and the 196th Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>Regiment, which numbered 750 men, also one hundred days' men ; these remained with me |
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 83
</p>
<p>sixty or seventy days. I telegraphed for these reinforcements. There were between 8,000
</p>
<p>and 9,000 prisoners in camp up to November. On the 6th of November, the morning report
</p>
<p>shows 796 men, rank and file, fit for duty. There were always on duty in Chicago about
</p>
<p>sixty men acting as provost guard ; this left 736 men in camp to do guard duty. The sixty
</p>
<p>men in the city performed service in looking after deserters, guarding property, &c. The
</p>
<p>depot for supplies is in the city, and is in charge of the depot quartermaster. Troops were
</p>
<p>used for doing camp duty, and guarding prisoners of war, and forwarding deserters to vari-
</p>
<p>ous camps. The entire guard in Camp Douglas was about 500 men, 250 on duty at a time,
</p>
<p>and 250 off. These were changed every other day. The camp is within the city limits,
</p>
<p>and is about three miles from the Court House.
</p>
<p>The conveniences to reach the camp are by way of street cars. There were buildings on
</p>
<p>the north side of the camp; on the opposite side of the street, also on the east side, there
</p>
<p>was a hotel and other dwellings. Walsh's house was about, one-fourth of a mile from the
</p>
<p>camp, with three or four houses between Walsh's house and the camp. My duties are two-
</p>
<p>fold ; I have to report to Gen. Cook, at Springfield, commanding in the State, and to Gen.
</p>
<p>Hooker, at Department headquarters. In relation to prisoners of war, I am under the
</p>
<p>instructions of the Commissary General of prisoners at Washington. These prisoners were
</p>
<p>arrested at my order. Messrs. Walsh, Cantrill and Daniels were arrested by Lieut. Col.
</p>
<p>Skinner and a detachment of troops, at Walsh's house. Grenfel and the witness Shanks
</p>
<p>were arrested at the Richmond House, and Mr. Marmaduke was arrested at the residence
</p>
<p>of Dr. Edwards, No. 70 Adams street. Judge Morris was arrested by Mr. Keefe and men-
</p>
<p>bers of the police. These arrests were made on the 6th of November. They were arrested
</p>
<p>upon information which led me to believe that there was on foot a conspiracy to release the
</p>
<p>prisoners, and get up a revolution in Indiana and Illinois. I regarded the emergency as
</p>
<p>immediate, and therefore acted promptly. I dared not trust the telegraph and the railroad,
</p>
<p>for I understood that the Sons of Liberty had men employed upon them. There were one
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty men arrested in all. They were principally from the South and Central
</p>
<p>Illinois, and had lately arrived in Chicago. These were mainly from Fayette and Christian
</p>
<p>counties, Illinois. These were arrested in grog-shops, boarding-houses, under the pavements,
</p>
<p>and in every part of the city All of these men were arrested from their appearance and
</p>
<p>description, and by their looks were taken to be vagabonds. There were but few of them
</p>
<p>armed. They asserted that they came to Chicago to see the city. Some of them stated
</p>
<p>that they belonged to the Sons of Liberty, and some from the Southern army ; about one
</p>
<p>tenth came from the Southern army. These bushwhackers were arrested partly by the city

</p>
<p>police, partly by citizens, and some by soldiers.
</p>
<p>Have heard of such an organization as Klingmen's men. Most of them coming from
</p>
<p>Christain and Fayette counties. It was chiefly made up of deserters from the Federal army
</p>
<p>and those who ran away from the draft, and was intended to resist the draft and all the
</p>
<p>operations of the Provost Marshal and the General government in the prosecution of the
</p>
<p>war. I succeeeded in capturing the Captain and Lieutenant, and the principal men of the
</p>
<p>organization. It was not an organization under the United States or State law. I received
</p>
<p>all of these men up to the 8th of November, and all being strangers, I took them in.
</p>
<p>I do not know the exact size of Camp Douglas, but believet it compises from 60 to 70 acres
</p>
<p>of land. The prisoners square proper, covers about 20 acres. In November last it was
</p>
<p>enclosed by a board fence 12 feet in height and made of lumber an inch and a quarter in
</p>
<p>thickness. The boards were placed endways and were nailed from the inside. The outside
</p>
<p>sentinels were stationed on a parapet about three feet from the top of the fence on the out-
</p>
<p>side. The camp was more easily assailable from without and less defensible than if the
</p>
<p>attack was made from inside.
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate here exhibited to the witness a plan of the camp found on the person
</p>
<p>of one of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>Colonel Sweet.  The map is very roughly drawn and is a little out of proportion in detail,
</p>
<p>but is a correct drawing of the camp as it was in August and September of last year. The
</p>
<p>outlines are precisely the same. As shown on the map there were then 40 barracks in the
</p>
<p>prison square. This number is now increased. The Guard-house and small tents on the
</p>
<p>west side of the camp are also moved now. The barracks marked "Yankee Barracks" is
</p>
<p>the correct position of the barracks occupied by the garrison in Garrison Square. The
</p>
<p>building marked " Douglas House " on the South side of the camp is, I suppose the Douglas
</p>
<p>University. It is a magaiticent building and is located about eighteen or twenty rods from
</p>
<p>the camp fence, and overlooks the entire camp. One hundred men, or even fifty men,
</p>
<p>stationed in that building, would command Camp Douglas, and almost make it untenable to
</p>
<p>any force. During the session of the Democratic Convention, and until the danger was
</p>
<p>over, I stationed two companies near that building. I had in my charge a prisoner named
</p>
<p>John T. Shanks at that time ; he was there when I assumed the command of the camp, on
</p>
<p>the second of May, 1864. He was a clerk in the office for the commissary of prisoners. He
</p>
<p>applied to me to take the oath of allegiance during the summer. His application went
</p>
<p>through me to the Commissary General of Prisoners with my approval. I nt-ver approved
</p>
<p>these applications unless I was fully convinced that the applicant was desirous of becoming
</p>
<p>84 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>a loyal citizen. The application was not granted, but I made it the basis of communication
</p>
<p>to Commissary General that Shanks desired to serve the United Slates, and to take the oath.
</p>
<p>In this camp there were some men who were more largely entrusted than others. Shanks
</p>
<p>was a paroled prisoner, having the freedom of Garrison Square during the day time. There
</p>
<p>were others there in the same condition  a man named Grey, and clerks in the medical
</p>
<p>department. Shanks was allowed to go to the city Iwo or three times in company wiih an
</p>
<p>officer. The prisoners are never permitted to have any funds. I gave Shanks a dollar.
</p>
<p>Shanks never used a nomme de plume that I am aware of. The prisoners were not allowed to
</p>
<p>have any money, nor did they possess any unless they obtained it secretly. Shanks, however,
</p>
<p>had, I believe, one dollar, which I gave him. When a prisoner is brought to camp he is
</p>
<p>thoroughly searched, and any money taken from him is placed in hands of the Prisoner's
</p>
<p>Accountant, to be drawn, if required, in provisions froL> the sutler. Letters are all opened,
</p>
<p>and any money they contain similarly applied. I sent Shanks to the house of Judge Morris
</p>
<p>on the the 3rd of November, because five men had just escaped from the camp, and 1 traced
</p>
<p>them, I believe, to that house. I asked Shanks if he would not like to do the government
</p>
<p>a service. He replied that he would, when I told him that I wanted him to go to the house
</p>
<p>of Morris and represent that he had violated his parole and escaped, and if possible must be
</p>
<p>secreted with the other prisoners. I then sent for Keefe, and the two went to the ciiy in a
</p>
<p>buggy. I followed on the street cars, and went to my office, No. 90 Washington street,
</p>
<p>where I had told Shanks to report if he could not find the prisoners. After I had been there
</p>
<p>a short time, Shanks came to me and gave me $30, which he said Mrs. Morris had given to
</p>
<p>him, with the exception of one dollar. I do not think he had any money when he went to
</p>
<p>her house.
</p>
<p>I know Maurice Langhorne. He introduced himself to me on the 5th of November, by
</p>
<p>showing me a letter from Secretary Seward to Secretary Stanton, recommending that he be
</p>
<p>allowed to take the oath of allegiance. He gave me some information regarding the plot,
</p>
<p>but I did not know whether or not to take him into my confidence. At a subsequent meet-
</p>
<p>ing, the next day, however, at the Tremont House, I determined that he was an honest, reli-
</p>
<p>able man, and one who could be trusted- He has been of great value to me, and his infor-
</p>
<p>mation was ever correct. On the 12th of November, after the first arrests were made, I
</p>
<p>first offered to employ him. I asked him to identify all who he remembered having seen in
</p>
<p>Canada, in connection with the conspirators, and arrest them. He personally arrested the
</p>
<p>witness, John Maughan, at the Tremont House. He gave me information of the ammuni-
</p>
<p>tion in Walsh's house, and subsequent facts proved that his information was perfectly cor-

</p>
<p>rect. I gave him the fictitious name of Johnson. He never acted as a detective, but simply
</p>
<p>aided in arresting men he had known before. Shanks worked for the Government ever
</p>
<p>since I knew him. Up to the 12th of November, he received no pay, and after that got. $100
</p>
<p>a month as his salary. I believe, however, that I previously gave him one month's salary,
</p>
<p>to purchase some citizen's clothing. Of the arms seized at Walsh's house I have the shot
</p>
<p>guns at camp. The pistols were entrusted to Col. Hough to arm a citizens' patrol, and he
</p>
<p>has not returned them. I do not know the exact number of arms we captured. There were
</p>
<p>about 354 revolvers and 200 double barreled guns found in his house, and thirty cavalry
</p>
<p>carbines in his barn in the city ; the latter weapons were not loaded, but those found in his
</p>
<p>dwelling were. There were also from 14,000 to 15,000 rounds of cartridges, and some
</p>
<p>roughly made buckshot cartridges, the number of which I do not remember. We also
</p>
<p>obtained some arms from other persons arrested, I mean the bushwhackers. I do not think
</p>
<p>that any arms were found on any of the prisoners at the bar, except, possibly, Grenfell.
</p>
<p>It will be interesting to the citizens of Chicago, if not in other localities, to
</p>
<p>peruse the following report from a newspaper, which has perhaps done more than
</p>
<p>any other in the United States, to aid and promote the interests and cause of the
</p>
<p>rebels  a paper, the baneful influence of which Gen. Burnside well knew, and
</p>
<p>would have crushed out; but the editor of that print was suffered to proceed on
</p>
<p>his dirty and devlish work, and most industrious has he been. The most loath-
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>above the comprehension of man, we may wonder at, but never understand why
</p>
<p>beings in the guise of men, were ever formed, who know no patriotism, no grati-
</p>
<p>tude, none of the nobler attributes of man, and whose mission seems but destruction

<p>days of victory and triumph of Union arms, would "steal the livery of heaven to
</p>
<p>serve the devil in," and prate of its devotion to the Union, furnishes us some

<p>information it were well for good citizens to know, and which we will presume is
</p>
<p>(unlike most statements in that concern) reliable.

<p>LIST OF McOLELLAN OKGAtflZATIONS IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO.
</p>
<p>We extract the following from the Chicago Times of October 20, 1864. It
</p>
<p>will do to keep for reference. The comments which preface the list are from the
</p>
<p>pen of the editor of that delectable print. The only comment we need make is,
</p>
<p>that almost every man whose name is upon the list, was a member of the Chicago
</p>
<p>Temple of the Sons of Liberty, in good and regular standing with the order :
</p>
<p>" There is at present a thoroughly organized and efficient McClellan club in nearly every
</p>
<p>ward in the city. The good that has resulted to the democratic party from these organiza-
</p>
<p>tions is more than can be readily imagined. They have done much to stimulate men to an
</p>
<p>interest in the issues of the day which never would have been felt but for the exertions of
</p>
<p>the clubs. In those wards where these organizations have not already been formed, meetings
</p>
<p>are appointed to take place this week for the purpose of forming them, and by the next
</p>
<p>Sabbath there will be one in every ward in the city. Ordinarily the clubs meet once a
</p>
<p>week, but they convene oftener for special purposes. There are always speakers ready to
</p>
<p>address these meetings, being local candidates, speakers residing in the wards where the
</p>
<p>meetings are held, or speakers from abroad. Below will be found a list of the McClellan

</p>
<p>(LOT to Assassinate the President op the United States  Tins
</p>
<p>consumation of tiie infernal plot  death of president llw
</p>
<p>coln and Deadly Assault upon Secretary Seward  Resolution*
</p>
<p>OF THE CniCAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
</p>
<p>During the autumn of 1864, at a meeting of the Sons of Liberty, in
</p>
<p>Chicago, a proposition was introduced which contemplated the raising of a fund
</p>
<p>of fifty thousand dollars, which was to be expended in payment of the services of
</p>
<p>some person who would undertake to assassinate the President of the United
</p>
<p>States. This was an informal proceeding, the meeting having just adjourned,
</p>
<p>but it was discussed by several of the leading members, who declared that the
</p>
<p>" extermination of tyrants was obedience to God."
</p>
<p>What say you, citizens of Chicago, concerning the band of traitors in your
</p>
<p>midst, who meditate and discuss such crimes as make the soul sicken, and the
</p>
<p>face blanch with horror; would not any honest man deliver this department of
</p>
<p>Jeff Davis' most efficient allies into the hands of the United States Government,
</p>
<p>by any means Heaven might place in his power ? If there is a man so fastidious
</p>
<p>of propriety, so mindful of selfish considerations, that he would not, then, in our
</p>
<p>opinion, that man is a coward, a traitor, an imbecile too weak to punish, and
</p>
<p>deserving the scorn and contumely of his countrymen, for all coming time. Thie
</p>
<p>proposition was the next day reported in a dispatch to Col. Sweet, and is now on
</p>
<p>file in his office. It may be that the persons who discussed the proposition, would
</p>
<p>not themselves have undertaken the accomplishment of the deed, but the animw
</p>
<p>of the party was thus rendered apparent, and the proposition was gravely considered
</p>
<p>and discussed. This occurred soon after an interview, by the writer, with Maj.
</p>
<p>Gen. Hooker, at the Tremont House, in Chicago, in October. It had been often said
</p>
<p>that in case Lincoln was elected, he should never be inuagurated, implying that
</p>
<p>his life would be terminated before that event. Some of the very parties who
</p>
<p>made these threats, have since been prisoners in Camp Douglas, but are now at
</p>
<p>large. On the night of the 14th of April, 18G5, assassins, who were, doubtless,
</p>
<p>members of the Sons of Liberty, in accordance with the same spirit in which that
</p>
<p>Order came into existence, and was conducted from first to last, consumated their
</p>
<p>hellish designs by shooting President Lincoln, and stabbing Secretary Seward.

<p>The nation now mourns the loss of the noble martyr of freedom, the truest

<p>88 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>heart, the most devoted patriot, the sincere advocate of republican institutions,
</p>
<p>and the friend of the people. In every city, town, and village, and hamlet of the
</p>
<p>land, is sincere mourning; deepest grief swells the hearts and dim the eyes of all
</p>
<p>who have hearts to feel, and fountains of tears, for the greatest bereavement that
</p>
<p>has ever befallen our nation. The emblems of mourning, the solemn tolling of
</p>
<p>bells, the universal gloom which overshadows our land, all impress upon our hearts
</p>
<p>the terrible affliction that has come upon us, and while we would bow reverently
</p>
<p>before Him who doeth all things well, and whose wise purpose in this chastising
</p>
<p>of our already sorrowing people may not now be apparent, we cannot repress the
</p>
<p>just indignation of our souls that moves us to the enactment of that stern justice
</p>
<p>which is imcompromising, and which cries to Heaven for vengeance, which nerves
</p>
<p>our hearts and hands to deeds, the generous, noble, President of the nation, now
</p>
<p>eilent in the tomb, would have softened or averted. Villians have slain the man
</p>
<p>whose heart was large enough to take into his affections and paternal love, the
</p>
<p>whole country,  the man who knew no North, no South, no East, no West, but
</p>
<p>whose devotion to the best good of the people, was the ruling motive of a life so
</p>
<p>full of honors and usefulness. The North had no friend like Lincoln ! The
</p>
<p>South had no friend like Lincoln ! And, as our noble armies now march onward
</p>
<p>to victory, and crush out beneath their iron heel, the last vestige of treason,
</p>
<p>the memory of Lincoln will prove a watch-word of magic power; soldiers
</p>
<p>will remember the entreaties, the offers of pardon, the paternal affection of the

<p>noble Lincoln, and the base ingratitude of the demon who consigned him to the

<p>tomb; they who have commended his magnanimity, his humanity, his hopefulness,
</p>
<p>his reluctance to deal out stern justice, which required hard blows  such of our
</p>
<p>fellow-citizens will now, with holy indignation, rise in their might, and sweep from

<p>the land those whose treason is heard, and whose bloody hand is uplifted, aye,

<p>and those who devise their hellish schemes in secret chambers and hiding places

<p>in our own cities and towns. " Remember Lincoln," will be the battle-cry
</p>
<p>of our boys as they encounter armed treason in the field, and " Remember
</p>
<p>Lincoln," should be the watchword of friends of freedom at home, when
</p>
<p>hesitating in clemency, to strike down Copperheads who seek to embarrass
</p>
<p>the government, and hope for, prophicy and delight in its reverses upon the field

<p>by any and all sacrifices, with a people who have sought to destroy our country,

<p>and have stricken down the pride of our nation, the noblest of our land, and the
</p>
<p>champion of liberty. The Chicago Board of Trade assembled upon the morning
</p>
<p>of the 15th of April, and adopted the following resolutions :
</p>
<p>Resolved, That this Board has heard with mingled sentiments of grief and horror of the
</p>
<p>foul assassination, by accursed traitors, of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
</p>
<p>Btates.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That we mourn in the deepest sorrow his loss as a national calamity. Hia
</p>
<p>persevering and devoted patriotism through the dark days of the Republic ; his wisdom
</p>
<p>alike in the hour of trial and triumph, have embalmed his memory in the hearts of his
</p>
<p>countrymen, and encircled hiB fame wit a a glory which time can never tarnish.

</p>
<p>Resolved, That in this infernal act we see but another instance of the demoniac hate of
</p>
<p>the slave power, arrested by ihe strong arm of the government, under the heaven inspired
</p>
<p>leadership of Abraham Lincoln, in its career of treason, murder and despotism; and we
</p>
<p>are admonish d anew to insist upon no compromise with the infamy, and upon the condign
</p>
<p>punishment by the mailed hand of power, and the strong arm of the law, of treason and
</p>
<p>its abettors, wherever found.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That in our capacity of business men and citizens, we vow eternal hate to the
</p>
<p>treachery and treason of the rebellion, which, in addition to its before unnumbered crimes,
</p>
<p>has added the cowardly assassination of Abraham Lincoln in the vain hope of destroying
</p>
<p>this Republic.
</p>
<p>Resolved, Th t in deep humiliation, we bow before the God of battles and of Nations, and,
</p>
<p>in this hour of our grand triumph and overwhelming sorrow, we reverently consign to His
</p>
<p>all-guiding wisdom the destiny of this Republic, and pray Him still to have it in His holy
</p>
<p>keeping.
</p>
<p>Revolved, That the members of this Board, who have, from the war's beginning, felt it
</p>
<p>their duty, as it has been their privilege and their pride, to sbind liy the nation and its
</p>
<p>President and all its constituted leaders, loyally aiding and encouraging, as they could, the
</p>
<p>Cabinet and the Army in the gigantic struggle of the past f jur years, do now solemnly,
</p>
<p>unitedly, in the presence  f Almighty God, and in humble reliance on the Divine help,
</p>
<p>pledge our full, unreserved, and trusting support to the Government of these United States,
</p>
<p>and to the men who now constitutionally succeed to the authority and powers, now laid
</p>
<p>down by the great and good man, who has fallen a precious and holy sacrifice on the altar
</p>
<p>of his country. And the members of this Board, in making this solemn pledge, do the
</p>
<p>same, not for themselves only, but in behalf of the loyal and patriotic people of the North-
</p>
<p>west, who have freely offered their first-born, and best, beloved for their coun ry's existence,
</p>
<p>security and honor.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the members of this Board express their profound and respectful sympathy
</p>
<p>with the bereaved family of the deceased, and with the associates of the departed in the

</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII.
</p>
<p>YPOCRICY of Copperhead newspapers  Complicity with assassi-
</p>
<p>nation  The leaders and their victims.
</p>
<p>During the month of February, by Executive clemency, a number of I
</p>
<p>Copperheads were released from confinement in Washington, where they
</p>
<p>had been placed as a measure of public safety. The Times published, and
</p>
<p>other Copperhead papers echoed the following. That paper now, in a very pious
</p>
<p>spirit, piteously urges, and the prints of like character also echo it, that " there
</p>
<p>should be no more party strife," " no more rancor," that it has not stabbed the
</p>
<p>President since he was shot, and the office is now draped with deep mourning.
</p>
<p>Aminadab Sleek is going to them as a comforter, and as tears mitigate woe, he |
</p>
<p>bears with him an onion. The Times says :
</p>
<p>"We submit that this fact should damn this Administration, not only for all time, but, iff
</p>
<p>there be justice hereafter, to all eternity. There is not a single civilized government in
</p>
<p>existence to-day, against which can be charged a similar display of tyranny. With the
</p>
<p>title of be ng the freest government of modern ages, we have sh wn ourselves to be one
</p>
<p>who~e disregard of right and whose outrageous assumptions of power are only paralleled >
</p>
<p>in the reign of despots.
</p>
<p>T e liberty of fifty men may seem a small affair ; but the matter has not so much refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the magnitude of the offence as it has to the principle which underlies it. The
</p>
<p>moment Mr. Lincoln, or Mr. Seward, or any other man. dares to deprive one per on of hia )
</p>
<p>liberty without due process of law, that moment has the government been changed from i
</p>
<p>one of the people to an autocracy  a tyranny. If any man to day is free in this country, it |
</p>
<p>is not because he is a good citizen, surrounded by the protection of the laws, but simply
</p>
<p>because Seward or Lincoln has not chosen to order his incarceration.
</p>
<p>The epitaph of posterity upon this people is easily anticipated. It will be  died 24,000,-
</p>
<p>000 of whites, who lost their liberties and lives in an attempt to give a fictitious freedom to
</p>
<p>4,000,000 negroes."
</p>
<p>"Sic semper tyrannis!" exclaims Booth, who has read the above article, and
</p>
<p>the mission of the Times is accomplished, and it now wants " no more party
</p>
<p>rancor."
</p>
<p>" Out of my sight thou serpent ! That name best
</p>
<p>Befits thee with him leagu'd, thyself as false ! "
</p>
<p>Tho palpable hypocricy of rebel sympathizers, can now only excite contempt,
</p>
<p>Who that read the evidence of Clement L. Vallandigham, before the military

<p>commission in Cincinnati, gave him credit for sincerity when he said substantially
</p>
<p>had he supposed there was a plot against the Government, he would have been
</p>
<p>the first to oppose or expose it. Have the people forgotten Mr. Vallandigham's
</p>
<p>record ? Have his Dayton neighbors forgotten his cry of " Ocoon," the cry of '
</p>
<p>distress of the Order to which he belonged, and which was to summon Sons of
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 91
</p>
<p>Liberty to his rescue, when arrested by the Government ? Have they forgotten
</p>
<p>Vallandigham's visit to Fulton county, Illinois, during the autumn of 1864, and
</p>
<p>its consequences ? This county was the stamping ground of the leaders of the
</p>
<p>treasonable organization, which has been dissected, and whose head and heart are
</p>
<p>now in a state of decomposition. In that county Assistant Provost Marshal
</p>
<p>Phelps was shot, there too enrolling officer Criss was shot; in that county is
</p>
<p>Lewiston, where resides S. Corning Judd, Esq., the Grand Commander of the
</p>
<p>Sons of Liberty in the State of Illinois. C. L. Vallandigham was the Supreme
</p>
<p>Commander of the Order in the United States. This Order inaugurated the new
</p>
<p>warfare at the instance of the Southern rebel leaders  inaugurated assassination.
</p>
<p>This order began with Provost Marshals and enrolling officers, and ended  if
</p>
<p>indeed the loyal people tvill it to have ended  with the assassination of the best
</p>
<p>the wisest, the most deeply loved President since the immortal Washington. It
</p>
<p>is the education of Copperhead prints, and Copperhead secret societies that ha3
</p>
<p>fitted the instruments of death, and our indulgence which has fostered them.
</p>
<p>Vallandigham's party had been defeated, his greatness had departed, and to
</p>
<p>wheel into line and " keep step to the music of the Union," was not for him, and
</p>
<p>as Milton's creation once exclaimed, so might he have uttered :
</p>
<p>"And in my choice
</p>
<p>To reign is worth ambition, though in hell;
</p>
<p>Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
</p>
<p>But wherefore let me then our faithful friends,
</p>
<p>The associates and co-partners of our loss,
</p>
<p>Lie thus astonished on the oblivion pool,
</p>
<p>And call them not to share with us their part
</p>
<p>In this unhappy mansion ; or once more
</p>
<p>With rallied arms to try what may be yet
</p>
<p>Regained in heaven, or what more lost in hell."
</p>
<p>And so Clement L. Vallandigham became Supreme Commander of the Sons of
</p>
<p>Liberty.
</p>
<p>Who is S. Corning Judd, who testifies before the Commission that " the organ-
</p>
<p>ization (Sons of Liberty) teas being used in Indiana and Missouri for improper
</p>
<p>purposes" ? Who is he that says the organization in Chicago "was looked upon
</p>
<p>by many of the leaders with great distrust; many of those connected with the

</p>
<p>standing or character"? that one of the delegates from Missouri stated his
</p>
<p>belief that the order in that State was in favor of " giving aid and comfort to the
</p>
<p>Confederates"? When Judd made these statements upon the stand, all loyal
</p>
<p>papers, with one accord, declared that the evidence fully warranted the arrests, in
</p>
<p>the manner and at the time they were made. No fair-minded man then could
</p>
<p>come to any other conclusion. Who, we ask, is S. Corning Judd ? Stump-speakers,
</p>
<p>last fall, would have said that he was the " Democratic " candidate for Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Governor  and so he was. The Gubernatorial ticket bore the name of James C
</p>
<p>Hobinson for Governor, and S. Corning Judd for Lieutenant Governor  the former
</p>
<p>a man who, in Congress, voted against " fighting, crushing, and destroying " the

</p>
<p>rebellion. Both Robinson and Judd were Sons of Liberty, and to them Copper-
</p>
<p>heads fondly turned, and had they carried the State, anarchy and bloodshed would
</p>
<p>have been the consequence; and, indeed, in the expressed opinion of Judge
</p>
<p>Morris, " had they carried the State, he cared not who might be President, for
</p>
<p>they would possess the reins of the General Government." S. Corning Judd
</p>
<p>sought to serve his own ends by controlling the Sons of Liberty, and failing in
</p>
<p>this, he gave the cold-shoulder to his Brig. -General (Walsh), when, in consequence
</p>
<p>of executing the edicts of the order, he found himself a close prisoner for the hor-
</p>
<p>rid doctrine of secession ; he must be tried and convicted, but tbe Grand Com-
</p>
<p>mander, S. Corning Judd, and the Supreme Commander, C. L. Vallandigham,
</p>
<p>and the Past Grand Commander, or Major-General, Amos Green, each, severally
</p>
<p>appear upon the stand against him, and they permitted to go scott free. 0, cursed
</p>
<p>doctrine of secession !
</p>
<p>"So etretch'd out huge in length the arch-fiend lay,
</p>
<p>Chai i'd on the burning lake ; nor ever thence
</p>
<p>Had risen or heaved his head, bui that the will
</p>
<p>And high permission of All-ruling Heaven
</p>
<p>Left him at large to his own dark designs ;
</p>
<p>That with reiterated crimes he might
</p>
<p>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
</p>
<p>Evil to others."
</p>
<p>If Vallandigham, if Judd, if Green, if Barrett, and if the many equally guilty
</p>
<p>persons released from custody go unpunished, then "Justice, thou art fled to
</p>
<p>brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason." Not that we would contradict
</p>
<p>Judd in the least in aught that he has said against the Chicago temple, but we
</p>
<p>would tell him that we know the Chicago temple, so far from taking the lead in
</p>
<p>radicalism, was behind the order in Peoria, in Bloomington, in Dubuque, in St.
</p>
<p>Louis, Louisville, and many other places. Give the devil his due. In some
</p>
<p>places the boldness of Copperheadism induced prominent members of the Sons

<p>of Liberty to approach members of Congress, with their base proposals to enter

<p>CHAP. XIX.
</p>
<p>)XTINCTION of Slavery  No Conciliation with Traitors-
</p>
<p>Down with Copperheads at Home.
</p>
<p>In a publication of this character, it will not be expected we should
</p>
<p>review either the causes which led to the great rebellion, with its hydra
</p>
<p>heads and its sad consequences, but in closing, and especially in view of
</p>
<p>the terrible tragedy which has plunged a nation in deepest grief, we cannot refrain
</p>
<p>from saying, that the last most diabolical deed was not the act of individual mad-
</p>
<p>ness, of personal hate and passion, it was the culmination of the hatred by the
</p>
<p>slave power of the principle of liberty, and the champion of freedom. It was not
</p>
<p>because the assassin felt in his heart a hatred of Abraham Lincoln, but because
</p>
<p>he, and the people at whose instigation he acted, hated the apostle of liberty,
</p>
<p>and the instrument in the hand of God for the accomplishment of a great and
</p>
<p>mighty work. Although it was the purpose of this band of murderers to assas-
</p>
<p>sinate the President and the whole Cabinet, it was not from personal malice against
</p>
<p>them as men, but the enemy sought by the destruction of the exponents of a free
</p>
<p>government, to give new life to the expiring representation of the slave power.
</p>
<p>So antagonistic was freedom to slavery that it was impossible to permanently
</p>
<p>embody the representatives of these principles with a republican government,
</p>
<p>which sbould be perfect in its formation, wise and just in its action, the hope of
</p>
<p>the liberty loving people throughout the world, and the pride and glory of American
</p>
<p>citizens. Every year since the adoption of the old Constitution, have discordant
</p>
<p>elements cropped out, and incidents transpired, which demonstrated to every
</p>
<p>rational mind, that as time rolled on, the accumulation of combustible elements
</p>
<p>would alternately explode, and shake the civilized world to its center.
</p>
<p>The facts that Northern teachers, Northern clergymen, Northern mercantile
</p>
<p>agents, Northern men upon business or pleasure, travelling at the South, and
</p>
<p>unwilling to stullify themselves, or become passive approvers and admirers of the
</p>
<p>"peculiar institution," were treated with all possible indignities, and might
</p>
<p>count themselves fortunate if they escaped with their lives. So complete was the
</p>
<p>universal devotion to slavery in all sections of the South, and so baneful its effects
</p>
<p>upon the people, that all other considerations were made subservient to this. For
</p>
<p>slavery friends were alienated, hatred established so bitter in its extent that only

</p>
<p>death could appease it. It demoralized the entire people ; it found its way with
</p>
<p>94 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>all its horrid moral deformities, into the very capitol ; it caused the muderous
</p>
<p>assault of Brooks upon Charles Sumner in the Senate, and the many altercations
</p>
<p>and bitter harangues which have from time to time disgraced our National Con-
</p>
<p>gress ; it was its cropping out that caused the fearless and noble President Andy
</p>
<p>Johnson, to threaten to hang Jeff. Davis  and which he may yet be called upon to
</p>
<p>perform ;  it was slavery that devised the doctrine of secession ; that has led to
</p>
<p>the deadly conflict upon hundreds of battle fields, and has spilled the best blood
</p>
<p>of our nation, and caused mourning and gloom all over the face of our once happy
</p>
<p>land. What wonder then, that the noble Lincoln, who, in the sincerity of his
</p>
<p>heart, and in the dictates of superior wisdom, who, seeing and appreciating the
</p>
<p>encroachments and horrors of slavery, not only to the people in bondage, but to
</p>
<p>the citizens of our country in every section  who wonders that Lincoln, whose
</p>
<p>name is immortal, especially for his extirpation of this curse, should be singled
</p>
<p>out by the demon of slavery, and assigned by Davis, his prophet, for a violent
</p>
<p>death. Thank God, the cancer is extirpated so thoroughly, that its fibres of
</p>
<p>death can never again form to threaten destruction to our land. True, the opera-
</p>
<p>tion has been most painful, and no anesthetic agent has been employed ; the
</p>
<p>suffering has been fearful, and the country has, to its extremities, trembled with
</p>
<p>anguish ; but it is over now.
</p>
<p>The assassination of the President was the will of Jeff. Davis, whispered in the
</p>
<p>temples of the Sons of Liberty or American Knights, into the ears of those of
</p>
<p>the members of the Orders, who had made the most proficiency in their teachings,
</p>
<p>and these beings, true to their oaths, went forth upon their mission of blood.
</p>
<p>The following " gems," from the debates in the Democratic National Conven-
</p>
<p>tion, will be read with interest now and in future time :
</p>
<p>S. S. Cox, said :
</p>
<p>" He had attempted in bis own city, a few weeks since, to show, in a very quiet way, that
</p>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD DELUGED THE COUNTRY WITH DLOOD, created "a debt
</p>
<p>of four thousand million of dollars, sacrificed two millions of human lives, and filled the
</p>
<p>land with grief and mourning."
</p>
<p>A pious man, who had listened attentively to his remarks, sang out "G  d d  n him."
</p>
<p>" For less offenses than Mr. Lincoln had been guilty of, the Englisb people had chopped
</p>
<p>off the head of the first Charles. IN HIS OPINION, LINCOLN AND DAVIS OUGHT
</p>
<p>TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME BLOCK TOGETHER."

</p>
<p>C. Chauncey Burr, editor of several Copperhead New York journals, said :
</p>
<p>"And it was a wonder that they had a Cabinet and men who carried out the infamous
</p>
<p>orders of the gorilla tyrant that usurped the Presidential chair."
</p>
<p>Capt. Koontz, of Pittsburg, an ardent McClellan leader, said :
</p>
<p>" If Democrats catch Lincoln's bloody spies among them, they must cut their d  d
</p>
<p>throats, that's all. [Applause.] It is the duty of every American to vote for a peace
</p>
<p>candidate."
</p>
<p>Baker, of Michigan, said :
</p>
<p>" Let us hurl that usurper from power. Never till that day come3 when the usurper and
</p>
<p>his victim meet at the judgment seat, can he be punished for his wrongs, for his conspiracy
</p>
<p>against American liberty."
</p>
<p>Benjamin Allen, of New York, said :
</p>
<p>" The people will soon rise, AND TF THEY CANNOT PUT LINCOLN OUT OF POWEE
</p>
<p>BY THE BALLOT THEY WILL BY THE BULLET." [Loud cheers.]
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 95
</p>
<p>Mr. Stambaugh, a delegate from Ohio, said
</p>
<p>"That, if he was called upon to elect between the freedom of the nigger and disunion
</p>
<p>and separation, he should choose the latter." (Cheers.)
</p>
<p>" They might search hell over and they could not find a worse President than Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln."
</p>
<p>Hon. Mr. Trainor, of Ohio, said :
</p>
<p>" He would urge the people to be freemen, and HURL ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND HIS
</p>
<p>MINIONS FROM POWER."
</p>
<p>Henry Clay Dean, said :
</p>
<p>" In the presence of the face of Camp Douglas and all the satraps of Lincoln, that the
</p>
<p>American people were ruled by felons. Lincoln had never turned a dishonest man out of
</p>
<p>office, or kept an honest man in. [A voice  'What have you to say of Jeff. Davis?] I
</p>
<p>have nothing to sny about him. LINCOLN IS ENGAGED IN A CONTROVERSY WITH
</p>
<p>HIM, AND I NEVER INTERFERE BETWEEN BLACK DOGS."
</p>
<p>" He blushed that such a felon should occupy the highest place in the gift of the people.
</p>
<p>PERJURY AND LARCENY WERE WRITTEN OVER HIM AS OFTEN AS WAS 'ONE
</p>
<p>DOLLAR' ON THE ONE DOLLAR BILLS OF THE BANK OF THE STATE OF
</p>
<p>INDIANA. (Cries of the 'old villian.') The Democracy were for peace."
</p>
<p>W. W. O'Brien, of Peoria, also threatened " to try him as Charles the first was
</p>
<p>tried, as a tyrant and a traitor, and if they found him guilty to hang him.
</p>
<p>The essential unity of Copperheadism with assassination, appears in the follow-
</p>
<p>ing remarks of Koontz, of Pennsylvania:
</p>
<p>"Shall more wives be made widows, and more children fatherless, and greater hate be
</p>
<p>stirred up between children of the same glorious constitution? IF NOT WE MUST PUT
</p>
<p>OUR FOOT UPON THE TYRANT'S NECK, and destroy it, The Democratic government
</p>
<p>must be raised to power, and Lincoln with his Cabinet of rogues, thieves and spies, be
</p>
<p>driven to destruction. What shall we do with him? ]A voice  "Send him here, and I'll
</p>
<p>make a coffin for him, d  n him."]
</p>
<p>As we review the events which have transpired during this war, we are strikingly
</p>
<p>impressed with the magnanimity, the forbearance, the humanity of the loyal State9
</p>
<p>in their relations to the rebels in arms, and we are also impressed with the great
</p>
<p>lack of the exhibition of these qualities  the most cnobling in national character 
</p>
<p>on the part of the so-called Southern Confederacy. From the hour of firing upon
</p>
<p>Fort Sumter to the present moment, the war has not been waged by the rebels aa

<p>if in defense of the great principles of truth and justice, but with the malignity,
</p>
<p>the cruelty and barbarity which would, in many instances, put to blush the savages
</p>
<p>upon our western borders. In our dealing with them, the honor, integrity, fidelity
</p>
<p>and dignity of the nation have never been forgotten \ and the policy of the noble
</p>
<p>President, laid low by the hand of the assassin, was never to give blows when

<p>words would answer,  never to exact by force what might be attained by reason-
</p>
<p>ing,  and never, under any cifcumstanees, to forget those qualities which make a
</p>
<p>nation truly great, the first and chief of which is charity. How has our enemy
</p>
<p>failed to appreciate this? The manner in which the warfare has been waged by
</p>
<p>the South will be mentioned by historians as cruel, dishonorable and disgraceful
</p>
<p>to people of a Christian nation. Failing of success upon the field, we find the
</p>
<p>Davis Government countenancing guerrilla warfare, burning bridges, murdering
</p>
<p>unarmed citizens, and desolating the homes of unoffending people, and committing
</p>
<p>piracy upon the high seas. Still failing of success and losing ground daily, but
</p>
<p>driven to desperation by the apparent hopelessness of their cause, they sink to
</p>
<p>the depth of infamy by establishing among us secret orders, the aim of which is
</p>
<p>9b THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>to educate men of base passions to deeds of dark dishonor and unmeasured infamyr
</p>
<p>men who receiving such instruction will concoct schemes for the burning of cities,
</p>
<p>for the liberation of their prisoners ; and, lastly, they have sunk so low in the
</p>
<p>mire of dishonor, impelled by savage ferocity and hate, that it would appear folly,
</p>
<p>if not downright criminality to longer deal with them on the principles of liberality
</p>
<p>and gentleness, which has marked our conduct hitherto. It was our generosity,
</p>
<p>our mildness, our spirit of conciliation that moved the hand of the demon who
</p>
<p>slew the country's truest friend. Let it be so no longer ! Let rebels feel that we
</p>
<p>are terribly in earnest. Let heavy blows be struck, and struck without delay, and
</p>
<p>let there be no exhibition of concession or conciliation, till the enemy sue for peace
</p>
<p>upon the terms the country proclaims. As well make Copperheads Christians or
</p>
<p>honest men, as to attempt by gentleness longer to subdue rebels, whose weapons
</p>
<p>are firebrands and assassins' daggers. It is futile ; try it no longer. Said the
</p>
<p>great French advocate of justice, when he was charged with being sanguinary,
</p>
<p>because he so frequently punished murder with death, " You tell me that it is
</p>
<p>bloody work, and sinful in the sight of Heaven to execute men; so it is, and I am
</p>
<p>disposed to desist, and I will, the moment men stop the crime of murder." So
</p>
<p>will we show clemency, when our enemy has laid down his arms, and not before.
</p>
<p>Another measure by our people would be attended with salutary results  the
</p>
<p>extermination of Copperheadism at home. Who helped to form secret societies
</p>
<p>of Sons of Liberty and kindred organizations, so industriously and so efficiently as
</p>
<p>editors of Copperhead publications. It is in these orders that assassins are trained,
</p>
<p>and prepared for their fiendish mission. Henceforth let the people  the loyal
</p>
<p>people of the most glorious country on which the sun shines  swear by the
</p>
<p>memory of our much loved and deeply lamented President, that henceforth no
</p>
<p>paper shall print, no man shall utter sentiments of treason, under the penalty
</p>
<p>of incurring that summary punishment, the righteous indignation of a sorrowing,
</p>
<p>long suffering people may inflict. If the people resolve to endure the curse of
</p>
<p>home treason no longer, and let Copperheads know that they can no longer
</p>
<p>co-operate with Jeff. Davis in any part of our land, we shall never again be called
</p>
<p>upon to aid in suppressing or exposing a North-Western Conspiracy, or any plot

<p>CHAP. XX.
</p>
<p>>^^)RIAL of the Chicago Conspirators  The Witnesses and the
</p>
<p>jHy\ Testimony.
</p>
<p>When our troops entered Richmond, among other rebel documents
</p>
<p>found was a bill, offered in secret session of the rebel House of Represen-
</p>
<p>tatives, January 30th, 1865, establishing a Secret Service Bureau, for the
</p>
<p>employment of secret agents, " either in the Confederate States, or within the
</p>
<p>enemy's lines, or in any foreign country," and authorizing the chief officer " to
</p>
<p>organize such a system for the application of new means of warfare approved^
</p>
<p>and of secret service agencies, as may tend best to secure the objects of the
</p>
<p>establishment of the bureau."
</p>
<p>The trial, conviction, sentence, and execution of Capt. Beall, for piracy on the
</p>
<p>lakes, and of Kennedy, for incendiarism in New York, are still fresh in the
</p>
<p>recollection of our readers. That these men were acting under instructions from
</p>
<p>the bureau of secret service of Jeff. Davis, no rational person can doubt. These
</p>
<p>acts were but incidents in the grand conspiracy at the North ; the guilty parties,
</p>
<p>who suffered death, were but the instruments of others, and the members of the
</p>
<p>secret organizations, who were cognizant of these acts and purposes, though yet
</p>
<p>unwhipped of justice, are more guilty, in the sight of Heaven, than the wretches
</p>
<p>who undertook the execution of the hellish design, and for which they suffered
</p>
<p>ignominious death.
</p>
<p>After the discovery of the purposes and acts of the leaders of the Sons of Lib-
</p>
<p>erty in Illinois, in co-operation with rebels, and the arrests detailed in a former
</p>
<p>chapter, a Military Commission was convened in Cincinnati for the trial of the
</p>
<p>prisoners, Morris, Walsh, Grenfell, Anderson, Daniels, Cantril, Marmaduke and
</p>
<p>Semmes, upon a charge of conspiring to sack and burn Chicago, and to liberate
</p>
<p>the prisoners in Camp Douglas.
</p>
<p>The Commission consisted of the following mamed officers :
</p>
<p>C. D. Murray, Colonel 89th Indiana Volunteers, President Commission.
</p>
<p>Ben. Spooner, Colonel 83d Indiana Volunteers.
</p>
<p>N. C. Macrae. Major United States Army.
</p>
<p>P. Vous lladowitz, Lieutenant-Colonel United States Army.

<p>98 THE GREAT NORTH WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>CONFESSION OF MRS. MORRIS, B. 8., AND HER SENTENCE.
</p>
<p>Cincinnati, Feb. 13.
</p>
<p>The following is Mrs. Morris' confession :
</p>
<p>McLean Barracks, Cincinnati, Feb. 5, 1805.
</p>
<p>To Maj.-Gen. J. Hooker, Commanding Northern Department, Cincinnati, 0.:
</p>
<p>General  I was arrested in Chicago, on the 11th day of December, by the United States I
</p>
<p>authorities, charged with assisting rebel prisoners to escape, and relieving them with money
</p>
<p>and clothing; also, withholding correspondence with the enemy. I desire to state the
</p>
<p>facts of the case, to confess the truth, and to ask such clemency at your hands as may be
</p>
<p>consistent with your duty as an officer of the government. I was born and reared in Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky. My home was in the South till within the List ten years, my connections and friends
</p>
<p>all being there. I had sympathy with them, though I was as much opposed to the secession
</p>
<p>movement as any one could be. Having a large acquaintance in Kentucky, I was charged
</p>
<p>with the distribution of a great deal of clothing and money among the prisoners in Camp
</p>
<p>Douglas, Chicago, sent to them by their friends, and which was done under the supervision
</p>
<p>of the proper officers of the camp. This I continued to do up to the time of my arrest,
</p>
<p>and in this way I made the acquaintance, and was understood to be the friend of the
</p>
<p>prisoners in camp.
</p>
<p>In the early part of last winter, an escaped prisoner named John Harrington, came to
</p>
<p>me and asked for assistance. He stated that he was going to Canada for the purpose of
</p>
<p>completing his education. I gave him money to the amount I believe of $20. Some time
</p>
<p>in the summer of the past year, a rebel prisoner named Charles Swager, a young man who
</p>
<p>had escaped from the cars while being conveyed to Rock Island, came to me for assistance.
</p>
<p>I gave him a coat, a pair of boots, and some money, to the amount I believe, of $15.
</p>
<p>There were two or three others that I had reason to believe were escaped prisoners, whose
</p>
<p>names I do not know. These I assisted with money, and to one of them I gave some cloth-
</p>
<p>ing. There were some others to whom I gave money and clothing, that I did not at the
</p>
<p>time know were rebel prisoners, but who afterwards I had reason to believe were such.
</p>
<p>I received letters from Capt. J. B, Castleman of the rebel army, and sent him verbal
</p>
<p>messages in return. He called at my house, and remained for a little while. Capt. Hines,
</p>
<p>also of the Confederate army, called and ate at my house once during last summer.
</p>
<p>I beg to be released from my present imprisonment, and promise that, if my prayer is
</p>
<p>granted, I will henceforth conduct myself as a truly loyal woman, without in any way
</p>
<p>interfering with the government or aiding its enemies.

<p>Witness my hand and seal, this 5th day of Februrry, 1865. Mary B. Morris.
</p>
<p>The following is Gen. Hooker's order relative to Mrs. Morris :
</p>
<p>Headquarters Northern Department, >
</p>
<p>Cincinnati, 0., Feb. 10, 1865. /
</p>
<p> [Extract.}
</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary B. Morris, now in confinement at McLean barracks, in the city of Cincinnati,
</p>
<p>0., charged with giving aid and comfort to the enemy, assisting rebel prisoners to escape, i
</p>
<p>and other disloyal practices, will, on or before Monday the 13th inst., be sent south of our
</p>
<p>military line3, under guard, into the so-called Southern Confederacy. Her sympathy with
</p>
<p>those in rebellion can there find its natural expression, and a more appropriate theatre of
</p>
<p>action. It, is but just to our government and laws, that the shield of its power should not
</p>
<p>be thrown over those who are inimical to it, and are giving active aid and sympathy to itsj
</p>
<p>enemies. The claim to protection by the government implies the reciprocity of fealty.
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 99
</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary B. Morris, who was ordered sent out of our lines by paragraph 1 of this order,
</p>
<p>in consideration of her professions and promises, is permitted to remain on the premises of
</p>
<p>her father, Edward M. Blackburne, at Spring Station, Woodford county, Ky., on considera-
</p>
<p>tion that she complies with the promises accompanying her confession, filed at these head-
</p>
<p>quarters, Feb. 51h, 1805. If such promises are not complied with, the first paragraph of
</p>
<p>the order to be in full force.
</p>
<p>By command of Maj.-Gen. Hooker.
</p>
<p>(Signed) C. H. Potter,
</p>
<p>Assistant Adjutant-General.
</p>
<p>The trial of the prisoner Cantril was deferred, owing to serious illness. During
</p>
<p>the progress of the trial, Anderson committed suicide, and Daniels escaped. [It
</p>
<p>will be remembered that H. H. Dodd, convicted of treason in Indianapolis, some
</p>
<p>months ago, and sentenced to suffer the death penalty, also escaped. Neither
</p>
<p>Daniels or Dodd have been recaptured.] The evidence before the Military
</p>
<p>Commission elicited most of the important facts embraced in this narrative, and
</p>
<p>therefore need not be reviewed.
</p>
<p>In regard to several of the witnesses before the Military Commission, a few
</p>
<p>remarks may not be uninteresting. It has been observed by the reader who has
</p>
<p>carefully perused the foregoing statement, that there were two distinct elements
</p>
<p>which made up the great conspiracy, viz : The Copperheads, or Sons of Liberty,
</p>
<p>and Knights of the Golden Circle, and the rebel emissaries both in the Northern
</p>
<p>States and in Canada. The discovery of the designs, purposes and intents of the
</p>
<p>former, was made by the writer of this work, who was aided by Robert Alexander.
</p>
<p>With such aid as we were able to control, we obtained and imparted the informa-
</p>
<p>tion which resulted in the total defeat of the devilish intent of our secret enemies 
</p>
<p>the Copperheads ; the purposes, movements, ends and aims of the Rebels in Can-
</p>
<p>ada, were reported by Maurice Laughorn, aid by two others. The parties in
</p>
<p>charge of observing and defeating the two distinct elements, were utter strangers,
</p>
<p>and had never met or had any communication whatever.
</p>
<p>In regard to the writer, it need only be said, that when it was announced to
</p>
<p>Hon. I. N. Arnold, M. C, Governor Yates, and Brig.-Gen. Paine, that there was
</p>
<p>a formidable conspiracy against the General Government, embracing many thou-
</p>
<p>sand persons in its league, and that its purpose was the subversion of our Govern-
</p>
<p>ment in aid of the rebellion, that their plots were rapidly maturing, and the most

</p>
<p>alarming consequences might be apprehended, if timely precautions were not
</p>
<p>observed, all of these gentlemen gave to the matter their earnest and careful
</p>
<p>attention. It was not the purpose of the writer to proceed with further investiga-
</p>
<p>tions, except by advice and direction, as it was a work for which he felt wholly
</p>
<p>unqualified, from his tastes, disposition, professional, and social position, but the
</p>
<p>arguments of Gen. Paine, which, at this time and place, it is unnecessary to state,
</p>
<p>but which it is believed neither party will soon forget, decided the matter, and
</p>
<p>the task was undertaken, and with what success it was attended, let the history
</p>
<p>of the proceedings in Cincinnati determine. For more than six months, the work
</p>
<p>was prosecuted with unceasing vigilance, regardless of all other considerations,
</p>
<p>100 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and although, when he was called to the witness stand, he could not shield him-
</p>
<p>self from the malignant abuse of counsel, by stating that he had been acting ander
</p>
<p>a commission received from his Government, yet he then felt morally certain, and
</p>
<p>that confidence yet remains unshaken, that when his true relations to tbe Govern-
</p>
<p>ment and country, are finally known, his motives, his acts, and his services, will
</p>
<p>be duly appreciated. He has not been mistaken. The contemptible falsehood of
</p>
<p>the party who stated that the writer's services had been compensated, or that a
</p>
<p>claim for compensation had been made, is hereby hurled back into his teeth. Not
</p>
<p>a dollar, not a dime, has been received, not even for actual expenses incurred, and
</p>
<p>wo claim whatever has been made  no consideration whatever has been proffered.
</p>
<p>The service was the result of a deep conviction of duty, a feeling that no citizen
</p>
<p>should withhold personal sacrifice, even of life and reputation, if the interest of
</p>
<p>his country demands it. We knew the condition upon which we stepped aside
</p>
<p>from the agreeable and peaceful avocations of life, and entered upon the task so
</p>
<p>distasteful, so repulsive, and for a time so thankless. We had reason to know that
</p>
<p>the shafts of fiendish calumny would assail, that friendship would be broken, that
</p>
<p>envy and jealousy would ply their inuendos, that the Copperhead elements of a
</p>
<p>fraternity, claiming one of the offenders in its ranks, would assail with bitterness
</p>
<p>and awaken poignant grief, but no regret, that we should have the hatred of Cop-
</p>
<p>perheads, as long as that genus (thank Heaven, short-lived), existed in our land,
</p>
<p>and be regarded with distrust by those negative persons, who would be for the
</p>
<p>Union, had they any independence of character; we knew all this would follow, if
</p>
<p>the assassin's bullet or dagger did not execute the sworn purpose of the Order,
</p>
<p>but with an abiding faith in the justice of Heaven, with an approving conscience,
</p>
<p>and our earnest heartfelt prayer for our loved country in her dark hours, we took
</p>
<p>our course, and our only regret is, that we had not sooner entered upon the work, and
</p>
<p>thereby frustrated plans which have contributed to our national suffering; for who
</p>
<p>shall say how many have been its victims, how many homes has it made desolate,
</p>
<p>how many hearts has it broken, and bow many graves now enclose misguided men,
</p>
<p>and misguided youths, who, educated in its fallacies, lured by its snake-like influ-
</p>
<p>ence, arrayed themselves against their country, and fell victims to their fanaticism!
</p>
<p>We ha^e heard the cry of our Union soldiers at the front, to protect the helpless
</p>
<p>in the rear, and we have tried to comply. We have given our own near and dear |
</p>
<p>kindred to the bullet and the sword, a sacrifice to freedom, and staunched the life-

<p>blood of a dearly loved brother, upon the field of Antietam, and as we wiped away
</p>
<p>the dew of death, gathering upon his brow, we pledged our life  our all  to the
</p>
<p>cause of the Union ; and if better service mi^ht be rendered in vanquishing the 
</p>
<p>secret foe at home, than meeting the more honorable enemy upon the field of bat-
</p>
<p>tle we were ready for the work. Had it not been for the potent influence of Cop-
</p>
<p>perheads at the North, the counsel, the sympathy, the comfort extended to the
</p>
<p>rebels, the rebellion would have been put down long ago. Entertaining sucbj
</p>
<p>views, we shall, under any and all circumstances, and at all times, be a bitter r
</p>
<p>opponent of Copperheadism wherever found, and regard it as legitimate warfare'

</p>
<p>to arrest the assassin of our country, wherever and whenever we can. If the dis-
</p>
<p>affected find comfort in this, let them make the most of it.
</p>
<p>ROBERT ALEXANDER.  This gentleman, who is well known to the citizens
</p>
<p>of Chicago, has held several positions of responsibility and trust, and has ever been
</p>
<p>a consistent, earnest, devoted advocate of the Union. So intensely Republican in
</p>
<p>sentiment is he, that the attempt to introduce him into the Sons of Liberty, called
</p>
<p>forth such opposition that it was thought we should fail in the attempt, and he
</p>
<p>finally, was only admitted, after he and his sponsor (the writer) had been told, in
</p>
<p>plain words, accompanied with an oath, that if he proved false to them, both should
</p>
<p>die. For months he bore the opprobrium of a Copperhead, and suffered extreme
</p>
<p>annoyances in sustaining the role it was his duty to assume. Conscientious, earn-
</p>
<p>est, persevering, patient, with keeu perception, and a remarkable power of reading
</p>
<p>human character, with the experience of an excellent police officer, Mr. Alexander
</p>
<p>brought to his post of duty high qualifications, and was a valuable, ready and
</p>
<p>willing assistant. It should be remarked that Mr. Alexander had been informed
</p>
<p>in May, 1864, that he had been appointed First-Lieutenant in the 53d U. S.
</p>
<p>Infantry, and supposed he was in the service of the U. S. Government at the time
</p>
<p>of joining this great undertaking, but the information, though coming from a high
</p>
<p>source, proved incorrect, and this is one additional reason why the writer made
</p>
<p>choice of Mr. Alexander. While we know that loyal men will appreciate Mr.
</p>
<p>Alexander's valuable services, we have yet to learn that he has, thus far, expe-
</p>
<p>rienced any other satisfaction than the approval of his own heart, and the sincere
</p>
<p>gratitude of the writer, for his hazardous undertaking, and the able manner in
</p>
<p>which he performed his duty.
</p>
<p>MAURICE LANGHORN, one of the principal government witnesses, was
</p>
<p>born in Pittsburgh, Penn., and reared in Marysville, Ky. He is a lawyer, and a
</p>
<p>man of ability. Like many other Kentuckians who were in the South at the time
</p>
<p>the rebellion broke out, Mr. Langhorn committed himself to the doctrine of seces-
</p>
<p>sion. In 1861 he enlisted as a private in a Louisiana regiment of heavy artillery.
</p>
<p>He was subsequently recommended for Colonelcy in the rebel army, but failed to
</p>
<p>get the appointment. In 1861 he went to Bowling Green, Ky., where he enlisted
</p>
<p>as a private in the 9th Kentucky Infantry, Col. Thomas H. Hunt, of Louisville,
</p>
<p>and was transferred to the artillery. He mounted the guns on the fortifications
</p>
<p>around Bowling Green, and seems to have given great satisfaction. He ran as

</p>
<p>candidate for representative to the rebel congress from Kentucky, but before the
</p>
<p>result of the canvass was known, was captured and held eight months as a prisoner
</p>
<p>of war. Mr. Langhorn subsequently took the oath of allegiance to the United
</p>
<p>States, and was of great service in reporting the movements and designs of the
</p>
<p>rebel emissaries in Canada to Col. Sweet. The information Mr. Langhorn gave of
</p>
<p>those men was reliable, and upon it certain arrests were made. Mr. Langhorn is
</p>
<p>now a loyal citizen, in its broadest and best sense. Mr. Langhorn is a young man
</p>
<p>not over twenty-five years of age, of quick, nervous temperament, kind and gen-
</p>
<p>erous impulses, a man of strong feelings, warm friendship, bitter animosities, and
</p>
<p>102 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>whatever be undertakes, he executes with a will. Of Mr. Langhorn it may be
</p>
<p>truly said, that while he was a rebel, he was an earnest, active foe, but a true
</p>
<p>soldier, having a high regard for honor and integrity, loving the State in whicb
</p>
<p>he was reared, and ever jealous of her honor and fair name. Mr. Langhorn was
</p>
<p>a rebel from principle  because he felt that the South was right  but when con-
</p>
<p>vinced of his error, he made haste to repair it, and when he had once taken the
</p>
<p>oath of allegiance, he went to work with all his might to aid the cause of the
</p>
<p>Union. To Mr. Langhorn is due all the honor of frustrating the designs of the
</p>
<p>rebels from Canada ; and Col. Sweet being advised by Mr. Langhorn of this
</p>
<p>portion of the plot, and by the writer of the Copperheads' movements and intents,
</p>
<p>the Colonel had the best possible opportunity of acquiring important knowledge,
</p>
<p>and regulating his conduct in accordance therewith. Mr. Langhorn is a true
</p>
<p>friend of the Union, an admirer of our lamented President, and has rendered the
</p>
<p>citizens of Chicago a service which should ever be held in grateful remembrance.
</p>
<p>MR. SHANKS  Once a Rebel officer of distinction, but now a loyal man,
</p>
<p>consistent in conduct, and of very great assistance to the Government, in ferreting
</p>
<p>out Rebel officers and Rebel sympathisers, has the confidence and respect of those
</p>
<p>who know him. He is a young man of signal ability, and if he continues to serve
</p>
<p>the country as faithfully as he has in the present case, will yet attain distinction.
</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER C. STRAWN Was a valuable witness. He is a young
</p>
<p>man who has taken an active part with the Democrats, and is well informed of
</p>
<p>the incomings and outgoings, and the eccentricities and pecudillos of the managers
</p>
<p>in Chicago, although the Post says, that " before his arrest he was not worthy of
</p>
<p>notice, and after his arrest still less so." We think the Post man a little severe
</p>

<p>JOHN M AUG HAN, an Englishman, born in Berkshire county, and about 22
</p>
<p>years of age* His family moved to Toronto, Canada West. He was always in

<p>Canada regarded as a young man, with fine business qualities and promise. For
</p>
<p>three years just before his connection with the rebels, and their Northern conspi-
</p>
<p>rators, he occupied a very responsible position as a clerk and teller, in one of the
</p>
<p>branches of the bank of Upper Canada, and was in every way worthy the confi-
</p>
<p>dence reposed in him. During the spring and summer of 1864, he however

<p>became acquainted with rebel soldiers in Canada, earnestly espoused their cause,
</p>
<p>and left his position to go with them to the Southern army. They, however,
</p>
<p>instead of going South, went to Chicago, where he became acquainted with the
</p>
<p>conspirators, and also gained their confidence, and on account of being an English-
</p>
<p>man, and having his papers with him, and being able to travel without fear of
</p>
<p>detection, he was used by them to carry their correspondence and other communi-
</p>
<p>cations, which were of too dangerous a character to trust to the mails. This man
</p>
<p>was truly a dangerous character. No one, except those who employed him, knew
</p>
<p>him, or the character in which he was acting, and he was able, frequently, to render
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTII-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 103
</p>
<p>the conspirators immense service in their desperate schemes. He was captured in
</p>
<p>Chicago in November, and finally agreed to turn State's evidence, when he saw
</p>
<p>that unless he did, his own life was forfeited. After this agreement, he was treated
</p>
<p>with great leniency by the Government, but upon being placed upon the witness
</p>
<p>stand, his old sympathies and prejudices returned, and it is believed he distinctly
</p>
<p>perjured himself, acting through the whole trial with bad faith toward the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment which had treated him so generously.
</p>
<p>THOS. E. COURTNEY A Son of Liberty, and a leading Democrat of
</p>
<p>Chicago, called a witness for defence, testified, among other things, as follows :
</p>
<p>" I was on a Committee of the Democratic party to recieve, at the Alton Depot, some bogiu
</p>
<p>voters that were to be imported into Chicago to vote at the Presidential election; they were part
</p>
<p>and parcel of (lie tribe that came from Egypt, and I was one of the Committee appointed <
</p>
<p>escort them to their boarding houses."
</p>
<p>OBADIAH JACKSON, Jr., Esq., Grand Seignior of the Temple, who had
</p>
<p>been arrested and sent to Camp Douglas, and while there had written and signed
</p>
<p>a " statement," was called for the defence, but it neither helped him or the
</p>
<p>defendants.
</p>
<p>COL. B. M. ANDERSON  Was born, reared, and educated in Kentucky.
</p>
<p>Be was a young man of education, ability, and fine personal appearance, and had
</p>
<p>he not been a rebel would have been an accomplished gentleman. He possessed
</p>
<p>many fine points of character, and was, in our opinion, a much better man than
</p>
<p>any of the Northern Copperheads who have been arrested. He had been in the
</p>
<p>Nicaraugua expedition, under the filibuster, Walker. Col. Anderson was the
</p>
<p>dupe of others. He committed suicide at the barracks in Cincinnati, during the
</p>
<p>progress of the trial. He leaves a wife and many friends to mourn his death.
</p>
<p>His history is a sad one. In any other position than a rebel, he would have been
</p>
<p>a most useful member of society. He was not of the material of which the Sons
</p>
<p>of Liberty was made up, but aside from that deadly fanaticism which ruined
</p>
<p>him, he won warm friends wherever he went. Nature did everything for him,
</p>
<p>but the accursed doctrine of Calhoun, consigned him to a suicide's grave, " after
</p>
<p>life's fitful fever" of war upon the land of his birth.

<p>CHARLES TRAVIS DANIELS One of the prisoners, is a native of Harri-
</p>

</p>
<p>prepossessing in appearance. He is somewhat remarkable for a rather strange

</p>
<p>and singular expression of his eyes. Belonged to John H. Morgan's command,
</p>
<p>but never served in any other capacity than as an enlisted man. He was captured
</p>
<p>with Morgan during his raid in Ohio, and confined in Camp Douglas, from which,
</p>
<p>he escaped ; was captured at Charles Walsh's house, on the 7th of November, and
</p>
<p>escaped again from the military authorities in Cincinnati, Ohio, while being tried
</p>
<p>by the Commission. He has not been recaptured, but has been found guilty by
</p>
<p>the Commission.
</p>
<p>CAPT. GEORGE CANTRILL Is a native of Scott County, Ky. Is about
</p>
<p>the same age as Daniels. There is nothing remarkable in connection with him,
</p>
<p>and of no more than ordinary intelligence. He also belonged to Morgan's command,
</p>
<p>104 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>in which he served as Company commander ; was in Morgan's last raid in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>and at his defeat at Cynthiana escaped to Canada. He was with the other rebels
</p>
<p>at Chicago during the Convention, and went with them to Southern Illinois for
</p>
<p>the purpose of drilling Copperheads. He was captured in the house of Charles
</p>
<p>Walsh, on the morning of the 7th of November last. On account of severe
</p>
<p>sickness he was not tried with the other conspirators.
</p>
<p>RICHARD T. SEMMES One of the prisoners, tried, convicted, and sentenced,
</p>
<p>for being one of the Chicago Conspirators, is a young man  not over 23 or 24
</p>
<p>years of age, a Marylander by birth, and a lawyer by profession. He is a relation
</p>
<p>of the pirate Semmes. (unfortunate in name,) said to be a nephew. He graduated
</p>
<p>at Yale College with distinction, and his prospects in Chicago were flattering till
</p>
<p>he connected himself with the Sons of Liberty, and listened to the teachings of
</p>
<p>older and "wiser" men.
</p>
<p>Of the witnesses for the defence we have nothing to say, further than most of
</p>
<p>them were Sons of Liberty. Some of them so far perjured themselves, that now
</p>
<p>a common lie to them is considered as good as the truth, if not a little better. It
</p>
<p>is said of Judge H. L. Burnet, that he remarked, had he known what witnesses
</p>
<p>the defence would have introduced, he would not have called any witnesses for the
</p>
<p>Government  they would have been superfluous. Rather severe, and we will hope
</p>
<p>he did not say it.
</p>
<p>Space will not admit of a review of the evidence, and this will be unnecessary

<p>for all who will read the sketch of the Judge Advocate's argument.
</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI.
</p>
<p>RGTJMENT of the Judge Advocate in the Conspiracy cases 
</p>
<p>Conviction of the Prisoners.
</p>
<p>vLa^ The evidence in the case before the military commission at Cincinnati,
</p>
<p>having closed, the counsel who represented the prisoners made their
</p>
<p>addresses  they cannot be called arguments  and the court adjourned to
</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 18. As lawyers who have no valid defence, observe it as a policy
</p>
<p>to attack the Government witnesses with great fury, so Messrs. Hervey and Wil-
</p>
<p>son, true to the ethics of their profession, made a grand assault upon the principal
</p>
<p>witnesses. Counsellor Hervey, in his harangue, used the following language, which
</p>
<p>illustrates the line of " argument" for defence :
</p>
<p>"Some two hundred years ago," said the learned counsel, "there was a man in
</p>
<p>England who swore away the lives of his fellow citizens by wholesale. His name was
</p>
<p>Dr. Titus Oates  the man who got up what was called the Popish plot, and by perjury
</p>
<p>and villainy, consigned many an innocent head to the scaffold. He was assisted by a man
</p>
<p>who has. as no other judge has, disgraced the ermine  Jeffries, who drank himself to
</p>
<p>death in the tower, when his co-worker in iniquities and evil deeds with dreadful and
</p>
<p>condign punishment followed him. The effort of nature to produce so great a monster
</p>
<p>was so terrible that it required a resting spell of two hundred years before she could pro-
</p>
<p>duce another such monster in the shape of Dr. I. Winslow Ayer."
</p>
<p>We forgive him, for he was obliged to seem to do or say something to earn his
</p>
<p>" fee." There being no arguments for defence, but only such pathetic appeals as
</p>
<p>only a lawyer, without the least hope, would make, feeling that his clients would
</p>
<p>expect something, we need not take our space to report their remarks.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday April 18, Judge Advocate Burnet made his closieg argument for
</p>
<p>the Government. It was truly a master-piece, complete in every part. It was
</p>
<p>such an effort as might have been expected, of one who has, during this long
</p>
<p>tedious trial, shown himself a gentleman, a profound counsellor, a true patriot and
</p>
<p>an advocate of justice, whose only aim has been to elicit truth, and be the better
</p>
<p>enabled to serve the true interests of the country. We would gladly present every
</p>
<p>argument and address he has made, during the trial, but space will not admit, and
</p>
<p>we therefore invite careful attention to the following sketch of his address:
</p>
<p>The Judge Advocate, in referring to the accused, said :
</p>
<p>There are two sides to this case ; two sides for the manifestation of sympathy. While
</p>
<p>here is an old, white-haired man before you, whose every thing is at stake ; while here is a
</p>

</p>
<p>father, a generous, open-hearted, and impulsive man, whose all is at stake ; and here is a
</p>
<p>106 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>soldier, who has fought in every clime, and who has taken up his sword to destroy life in
</p>
<p>every cause, whose everything is also at stake, yet there is, on the other side, your Government
</p>
<p>at stake. If these men be guilty, justice to the nation demands of you this day that you
</p>
<p>should convict them, and you must not waver. In the consideration of this case, you must
</p>
<p>bring to your aid a power, that may be a little more than is ordinarily given to human nature.
</p>
<p>You must, for the time, sink all hatred, malice, even human sympathy ; and rise, God-like,
</p>
<p>to determine the truth and adjust the punishment.
</p>
<p>That these accused would enter upon the commission of so heinous a crime, I can scarcely
</p>
<p>permit myself to believe. They have made a strong appeal to your sympathies. Each
</p>
<p>counsel has advocated the cause of his client with an earnestness and an eloquence that
</p>
<p>does him honor ; I shall always respect them, and bear them in kindly recollection.
</p>
<p>But there seems to have been something, during these four years of the nation's trial, that
</p>
<p>has appeared to paralyze the native instincts of the American heart. This phanton, this
</p>
<p>syren of secession, with her enticing song, seems to have lulled to sleep the better part of
</p>
<p>human nature. At the sound of her voice, and the flash of her eye, men have sprung to
</p>
<p>arms, to grapple with the life of the nation, because it was free! They have followed, at
</p>
<p>the beck of the syren, over desolated homes; they have trampled over the dead corses of
</p>
<p>muidered brothers, and innocent women and children. They have blackened the land with
</p>
<p>desolation, and made it the abode of moaning and woe. She has blinded, while she has
</p>
<p>demoralized them. Old men, forgetting their white hairs, have joined in the conspiracy at
</p>
<p>the beck of this >hantom, who has taken out of the human heart its heaven-born instincts,
</p>
<p>to plant there those of vengeance, and the thirst for blood.
</p>
<p>My tongue falters as I look over this country and see bereaved widows and orphans, the
</p>
<p>white-haired patriots that mourn for the first-born, that shall ne'er greet them, and those
</p>
<p>who sit at the desolate hearth, with hands upraised, waiting for the knock that will be but
</p>
<p>the death-knell of all their hopes ; and think that the phantom of secession has caused all
</p>
<p>this!
</p>
<p>Men who were kind fathers, kind husbands and noble patriots, have forgotten it all in a
</p>
<p>day, and have become traitors, and inculcated doctrines that have, by the hands of fiends,
</p>
<p>stricken down that patriotic and noble leader of the human race. There is something in it
</p>
<p>which no man can comprehend. The doctrines which they inculcate harden the heart, anu
</p>
<p>nerve the arm to crime, enabling them to commit robbery, arson and murder, for all is in
</p>
<p>her category ; and as they commit those crimes, the appeal to God for the justness of their
</p>
<p>cause. That is what has deceived these men ; it is this accursed phantom of secession that

</p>
<p>has blinded their eyes ; that has cooled their hearts and filled them with vengeance. It ia
</p>
<p>this that has changed and perverted the human instincts, that should have ruled in their
</p>
<p>breasts.
</p>
<p>Of this man Walsh, I have simply this to say: The evidence is as you have seen it. I
</p>
<p>have briefly sketched it ; I will not dwell upon much that ought to be said ; I can not.
</p>
<p>The testimony is voluminous, filling 2,000 or 2,500 pages. I have had but a few days to
</p>
<p>scan through it ; I have given you only the leading points, and you must judge. I would
</p>
<p>not say one word that would take from this family their father ; but if this man was guilty
</p>
<p>of this crime, or has aided and abetted this conspiracy, you have but one duty to perform.
</p>
<p>You must know no man, be influenced by no bias, betray no sympathy, but must be firm-
</p>
<p>in the performance of your stern duty. There are thirty millions of suffering people in
</p>
<p>this land, and against these, one man's life, if guilty, weighs little in the scale of justice.
</p>
<p>We have, unhappily, in the history of this war, frequently seen sympathy manifested for
</p>
<p>criminals, rebels and traitors  those who have brought this great injustice upon the true and
</p>
<p>the loyal. It is not mercy to acquit those guilty of cruelty toja people who are struggling
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 107
</p>
<p>for their very existence ; it would be cruelty to our brave soldiers, and to those who have
</p>
<p>been left widows and orphans.
</p>
<p>As to Judge Morris for his white hair and old age, I have only respect. For all that is
</p>
<p>worthy in him as a citizen, I do him reverence; but if this white-haired old man has
</p>
<p>engaged in a conspiracy agaiDst my nation and my country, I turn to the other side, and
</p>
<p>see white-haired patriots who mourn in sadness because such as he have done these evil
</p>
<p>deeds,  and I remember Justice !
</p>
<p>As to this man Grenfel, l confess I have no sympathy with him ; no sympathy for the
</p>
<p>foreigner who lands in our country when this nation is engaged in the struggle for human
</p>
<p>right and human liberty, and who takes part in the quarrel against us, and arrays himself
</p>
<p>on the side of those who are trying to establish tyrany and slavery. I have no sympathy
</p>
<p>for the man whose sword is unsheathed for hire and not for principle; for whom slavery
</p>
<p>and despotism have more charms than freeiom and liberty. The motive of such a one
</p>
<p>does not rise even to the dignity of vengeance. As has been said by his counsel, his sword
</p>
<p>has gleamed in every sun, and has been employed on the side of almost every nationality,
</p>
<p>and after this he engages in our struggle, and, as testified to by Colonel Moore, desires to
</p>
<p>raise the black flag against our prisoners ; and after men have yielded as prisoners of war,
</p>
<p>he rides up to one, and stabs him, coward like, in the back.
</p>
<p>But he is not true to the eause he espouses. When in Washington he went to the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of War and betrays the very people with whom he had been fighting ; tells all he
</p>
<p>knows of the strength, position and designs of the Confederates. He said he proposed to
</p>
<p>leave immediately for England, but he breaks his faith, proceeds to Canada, and is found
</p>
<p>among the conspirators, and is now here, charged with these crimes to-day. There is no
</p>
<p>throb of my heart that beats in unison with such conduct as this. Pie was a fit instrument
</p>
<p>to be used in this enterprise. What to him would be the wail of women and little ones ?
</p>
<p>What to him would be the pleadings of old men and unarmed citizens ?
</p>
<p>The delivery of Judge Burnett's argument occupied three and a half hours,
</p>
<p>after which the Commission adjourned to meet at four o'clock p. M., to deliberate
</p>
<p>on the findings and sentence. They accordingly met at the hour appointed, and,
</p>
<p>after mature deliberation, finally recorded their verdict.
</p>
<p>General Hooker issued General Orders No. 30, April 22, in which he promulgates the
</p>
<p>finding of the military commission which, for three months past, has been engaged in the
</p>
<p>trial of the alleged Chicago conspirators. The commission have acquitted 13uckner S.
</p>
<p>Morris and Vincent Marmaduke, and they are to be discharged upon their taking the oath

<p>of allegiance. They find Charles Walsh and Richard T. Semmes guilty of all the charges
</p>
<p>and specifications, and sentence the former to five years' imprisonment at hard labor from
</p>
<p>the 7th of November last, and the latter to three years' imprisonment at hard labor from the
</p>
<p>same date, at such place as the commanding general may direct. Gen. Hooker has named
</p>
<p>the State penitentiary at Columbus, Ohio.
</p>
<p>Cantrill's trial has been continued; Anderson committed suicide, and Charles Travis
</p>
<p>Daniels escaped. The commission found a verdict against Daniels, but it has not yet been
</p>
<p>promulgated. The findings against G. St. Leger Grenfell have not yet been announced
</p>
<p>oflicially ; but it is death, at such time and place as Gen. Hooker shall designate. The com-
</p>
<p>mission has been dissolved.
</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune, in speaking of the sentence, says :
</p>
<p>The trial of the Chicago conspirators has ended, the sentences have been pronounced and
</p>
<p>approved, and the court has adjourned. Buckner S. Morris and Vincent Marmaduke are
</p>
<p>acquitted and Charles Walsh and Richard T. Semmes were found guilty of the entire
</p>
<p>108 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>charges and specifications, to wit: of conspiracy for the relief of the prisoners at Camp
</p>
<p>Douglas, and of conspiring to "lay waste and destroy" the city of Chicago. Walsh is sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to imprisonment for five years from November 7th, 1864, and Semmes to imprison-
</p>
<p>ment at hard labor for three years from the date of sentence. The findings against G. St.
</p>
<p>Leger Grenfell have not been officially promulgated, but it is stated that he is found guilty
</p>
<p>and sentenced to death, at such time and place as Gen. Hooker shall designate. The peni-
</p>
<p>tentiary at Columbus, Ohio, is designated as the place of confinement of Walsh and Semmes.
</p>
<p>The trial has been long, mainly by reason of the course pursued by the defense, whose aim
</p>
<p>has been to protract it, so as to tire out the perseverance of the prosecution and the patience
</p>
<p>of the court and people. The court have performed their arduous duties with great ability
</p>
<p>and fairness. The result will doubtless be satisfactory to the people. It is proved that this
</p>
<p>great crime was in all its naked deformity and depravity actually committed. It follows
</p>
<p>that the Copperhead statement, published in the rebel organ in this city, charging that the
</p>
<p>entire plot and arrest of these Copperhead traitors and assassins were invented by the Union
</p>
<p>Republicans of Chicago as an electioneering trick, was the subterfuge of conscious guilt
</p>
<p>trying to cover up its tracks and to rub out the stains of its own attempted crimes. The
</p>
<p>same organ now impugns the " competency" of the Court. It may consider itself fortunate
</p>
<p>that it has not had an opportunity to argue the question of jurisdiction on its own behalf
</p>
<p>before a similar tribunal. Its opposition to such courts originates in a feeling of uneasiness
</p>
<p>about its own safety. For
</p>
<p>" Thief ne'er felt the halter draw
</p>
<p>With good opinion of the law."
</p>
<p>REV. DR. TIFFANY UPON COPPERHEADS.
</p>
<p>At a public meeting held in Chicago, after the announcement of the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion, Eev. Dr. Tiffany, in an able and eloquent address said :
</p>
<p>" God alone is great. At rare intervals he sends us a man beyond the limit of
</p>
<p>our measure. Our attention has been directed to the excellences of the character
</p>
<p>which belonged to our late President, and to the spirit of the system which gave
</p>
<p>strength to the blow of the assassin. A more terrible topic is now to be discussed 
</p>
<p>our relation to that spirit  our responsibility for that blow.
</p>
<p>We have been accustomed to say, "slavery is sectional, and freedom national."
</p>
<p>let those who elect slavery take the results of slavery to themselves ; let them
</p>
<p>suffer, if their choice brings suffering; but as for us, we wash our hands in
</p>
<p>innocency, and hold ourselves guiltless of blood." And so we have been going

</p>
<p>on ever since the outbreak of slavery in the form of armed rebellion. " They are
</p>
<p>the guilty parties, let them suffer." But has all this been right ? Have we had
</p>
<p>no responsibility ? Is no guilt ours ? We may not have owued slaves, but we
</p>
<p>may have made a common cause with men owners  may have brought condemna-
</p>
<p>tion upon ourselves by our tolerance, by our compromises.
</p>
<p>Sad and almost disgraceful is the record which exhibits our complicity with this
</p>
<p>sin. We began by making free States wait at the door of the Union until
</p>
<p>slavery had a counterpoise, or balance adjusted in the form of slave State, to
</p>
<p>preserve the balance against freedom in the National Senate. We compromised
</p>
<p>the territories west of the Mississippi, by tolerating slaves there, and as one
</p>
<p>demand after another was made it was granted, till we even allowed slave rule in
</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY. 109
</p>
<p>free States, by submitting to the Fugitive Slave law  these things could not have
</p>
<p>been done without our votes. When they threatened and blustered we fawned and
</p>
<p>cringed, until they knew and avowed their belief* that the crack of a slave whip
</p>
<p>would bring the north to its knees. All they asked we granted, more than they
</p>
<p>demanded we offered. We held out our wrists for manacles. When we elected
</p>
<p>the great good man, who embodied our idea of nationality and freedom; and even
</p>
<p>after official announcement had been made of the position slavery occupied in
</p>
<p>their proposed nationalism, we guarded their slaves, and kept them secure to labor
</p>
<p>for the support of the masters who were fighting against us. When these slaves,
</p>
<p>acting on an intuition of freedom, came fleeing to us, we sent them back to chains
</p>
<p>and bondage. In all this we showed our complicity with the sin which struck the
</p>
<p>blow which killed our good President.
</p>
<p>And after the slaughter of thousands in battle, and the death of as many more
</p>
<p>in hospitals, of fever, starvation and wounds, still was our hatred of the sin which
</p>
<p>caused them not deep enough. We talked of amnesty and non-humiliation, and
</p>
<p>God has permitted the sad cup to come to each lip in bitterness. Each one mourns
</p>
<p>to-day as if personally bereaved. The blackness of darkness is in our homes, and
</p>
<p>the whole nation mourns its first-born  its first-loved. May not  does not  a
</p>
<p>measure of responsibility rest upon us for this last sad event ? Have we not been
</p>
<p>tolerant of the treason which has wrought this crime ? Have we not been apolo-
</p>
<p>gists for infamy under the name of different political opinions ? Have we not
</p>
<p>spared when we should have punished  been merciful when mercy was but cruelty?
</p>
<p>We seem to have believed that because there were more serpents away from our
</p>
<p>homes, the few left here had no venom. We felt secure because the loyalists
</p>
<p>were more numerous than the traitors. But of the few who were here, and
</p>
<p>tolerated here, some plotted the escape of rebel prisoners, some the burning of
</p>
<p>our city, some the conflagration of New York, and some the murder of the Cab-
</p>
<p>inet, while one has killed the good President. Had they all been driven out, or
</p>
<p>put under strict surveillance, there would have been none of these things from
</p>
<p>them We have lost our President by tolerating traitors in our streets.
</p>
<p>Who was the assassin of the President? Not an armed rebel, clothed with
</p>
<p>belligerent rights; not a political refugee, who had skulked into our lines for
</p>
<p>rapine and tor \ hinder; but the citizen of a free State, who could visit and send
</p>
<p>his cards to the Vice-President with a flippant familiarity, which his aristocratic

<p>slave-nohliiig associates presume to use,  a man allowed to go about the streets of
</p>
<p>Washington, breathing treason and blaspheming God, without rebuke. He could
</p>
<p>command attention from proprietors of houses and saloons, from owners of blooded
</p>
<p>stock, from men who were called loyal, and the toleration of this killed our good
</p>
<p>President.
</p>
<p>He was a wretch, of whom a press said, but yesterday, that he was sincere in
</p>
<p>thinking he should rid the earth of a tyrant, by slaying the President, this
</p>
<p>sincerity must place him on a level with John Brown. [Hisses and cries of The
</p>
<p>Times.'] This was said yesterday, and read by thousands, and I know of no steps
</p>
<p>110 THE GREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>taken to prevent the utterance of similar insult and outrage to-morrow. For
</p>
<p>this tolerance we are responsible, and tolerance like this killed the good President.
</p>
<p>When a far-seeing military commandant ordered the suppression of published
</p>
<p>treason, there were men in high places, and men all over the land, who outraged
</p>
<p>the loyal masses by interfering to prevent the execution of that order, on the
</p>
<p>ground of disturbing the freedom of the press; but when our ministers went
</p>
<p>into Richmond they were muzzled, and the result has been that treason has been
</p>
<p>uttered, the good man called an imbecile  the generous man a tyrant  the restraint
</p>
<p>of traitors has has been referred to as, umiyation of power, and prisons have been
</p>
<p>called Bastiles. All this has been, and we have tolerated it. This has given aid
</p>
<p>and comfort to treason in the South, and traitors in the North, and this has killed
</p>
<p>the good President.
</p>
<p>The measure of our responsibility is the amount of our connivance at these
</p>
<p>things. No man is free from guilt who has winked at this wrong, who has inter-
</p>
<p>fered to prevent the punishment of wrong-doers, who has apologies for treason,
</p>
<p>who has not done all in his power to rebuke, denounce and punish the foes of the
</p>
<p>nation, at home and abroad. We stand, to-day, as though in the presence of the
</p>
<p>nation's dead, and here, on the tomb of our chieftain, let us swear eternal enmity
</p>
<p>to treason and to traitors. Nor let us, when the assassin shall be arrested and
</p>
<p>punished  oh ! let us not then think we have done our duty. I had rather the
</p>
<p>profane wretch who has done this deed were never taken, than that his execution
</p>
<p>should relieve our minds from one thought of our personal responsibility No;
</p>
<p>rather let the wretch be a fugitive and vagabond, with the mark of Cain upon
</p>
<p>him. Let none slay him, for we ourselves are not guiltless. And as he flies from
</p>
<p>men, with hate in his eyes and hell in his heart, let every home be an asylum
</p>
<p>from which he shall be barred, and every honest, loyal heart a sanctuary where no
</p>
<p>thought of complicity with him, or sympathy for him may enter. Let us bow
</p>
<p>before God to-day in humble penitence ; let us ask of Him forgiveness  Father
</p>
<p>forgive us, for we knew not what we did  that His hand be stayed, and the
</p>
<p>measure of our responsibility be canceled.
</p>
<p>In this connection, we may with propriety, introduce the following extract from
</p>
<p>President Johnson's recent speech to the Indiana delegation :
</p>
<p>" We are living at a time when the public mind had almost become oblivious of what
</p>
<p>treason is. The time has arrived, my countrymen, when the American pecple should be

</p>
<p>educated and taught what crime is, and that treason is crime, and the highest crime known
</p>
<p>to the law and the Constitution. Yes, treason against a State, treason against all the
</p>
<p>States, treason against the Government of the United States, is the highest crime that can
</p>
<p>be committed, and those engaged in it should suffer all the penalties. It is not promulgating
</p>
<p>anything that I have not heretofore said, to say that traitors must be made odious; that
</p>
<p>treason must be made odious; that traitors must be punished and imprisoned. [Applause.]
</p>
<p>They must not only be punished, but their social power must be destroyed. If not, they
</p>
<p>will still maintain an ascendency, and may again become numerous and powerful; for, in
</p>
<p>the words of a former senator of the United States, when traitors become numerous
</p>
<p>enough, treason becomes respectable. And I say that, after making treason odious, every
</p>
<p>THE QREAT NORTH-WESTERN CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>Union man and the Government, should be remunerated out of the pockets of those who
</p>
<p>have inflicted the great suffering upon the country. [Applause.] But do not understand
</p>
<p>me as saying this in a spirit of anger ; for, if I understand my own heart, the reverse is
</p>
<p>the case; and, while I say that the penalties of the law, in a stern and inflexible manner,
</p>
<p>Bhould be executed upon conscious, intelligent, and influential traitors,  the leaders who
</p>
<p>have deceived thousands upon thousands of laboring men, who have been drawn into the
</p>
<p>rebellion; and while I say, as to leaders, punishment, I also say leniency, conciliation, and
</p>
<p>amnesty, to the thousands whom they have misled and deceived, and, in relation to this, as
</p>
<p>I have remarked, I might have adopted your speech as my own."
