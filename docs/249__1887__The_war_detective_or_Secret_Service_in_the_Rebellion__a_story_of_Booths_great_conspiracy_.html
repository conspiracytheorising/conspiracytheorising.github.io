</p>
<p>" Look at that, l)oy, and lend me your opinion,"
</p>
<p>The speaker, a man apparently fifty years of age, threw into a
</p>
<p>youth's lap a piece of paper, folded like most business communica-
</p>
<p>tions usually are.
</p>
<p>"What! have you been getting letters?" smiled the young man,
</p>
<p>as he picked up the paper and began to unfold it.
</p>
<p>" It looks that way, and from high authority, too.
</p>
<p>" Not from " Here the speaker opened the letter, and finished
</p>
<p>with an exclamation : " From President Davis !"
</p>
<p>"Yes, from Jeff himself," was the reply. "Its contents will
</p>
<p>both surprise and puzzle you, but read and see whether I am cor-
</p>
<p>rect or not."
</p>
<p>The next moment the youth was reading the letter which was
</p>
<p>quite brief, and in the well known handwriting of the president
</p>
<p>of the Southern Confederacy.
</p>
<p>This was what he read :
</p>
<p>"Mr. Cantwell: Dear .Sir It is my earnest desire that you
</p>
<p>discover something about the man Maxon as soon as possible. I
</p>
<p>am fearful that he is a Northern agent in Colonel Baker's pay. I
</p>
<p>t)lace much reliance on you, and feel assured that you will devote
</p>
<p>rour time and energies to the service of the Confederacy. Maxon,
</p>
<p>teel, from what I have learned, is not a proper person to be in
</p>
<p>Richmond at this time. Very truly yours,
</p>
<p>" jErrEKSON Davis."
</p>
<p>"From the head of the Confederacy himself, and no mistake,"
</p>
<p>said the younger of the twain, aloud, looking up into the almost
</p>
<p>expressionless face of his companion.
</p>
<p>"You are right, Leon. This letter both surprises and puzzles
</p>
<p>me. Why should Davis address it to you, and who is this man

</p>
<p>Maxon suspected of being one of Baker's spies ?"
</p>
<p>A slight smile appeared at the corners of the listener's mouth.
</p>
<p>"One question at a time, Paul," he said. " Mr. Davis addresses
</p>
<p>me because he thinks I am a proper person to attend to Maxon.
</p>
<p>When did I meet the rebel president? Oh, since you left Rich-
</p>
<p>mond I have had several interviews with his excellency."
</p>
<p>"You have?" exclaimed the young man. "By heavens! you
</p>
<p>have more courage thau Maxon !"
</p>
<p>" One needs a little courage here to play the game I am playing,
</p>
<p>eh, Paul?" was the reply. " Yes, Jefferson Davis thinks me loyal
</p>
<p>to the cause, even now on its last legs in the trenches before
</p>
<p>Petersburg. Why should hesuspecta man introduced and vouched
</p>
<p>for by his own secretary of war ?"
</p>
<p>Paul looked astonished.
</p>
<p>" Who vouched for you to the secretary ?" he asked.
</p>
<p>"My letters."
</p>
<p>"From whom ?"
</p>
<p>"From some of the secretary's Canadian friends, let us say,
</p>
<p>Paul. Why, sir, I've been a frequent vi.sitor at the Confederate
</p>
<p>war office during the last fortnight. I could stuff you with infor-
</p>
<p>mation that would delight Grant, and take much of the sadness
</p>
<p>from Lincoln's face. I'm not a secret agent of this tottering gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, although that letter would make me one. Now, to your
</p>
<p>next question : Who is the man Maxon ? I fancy you would start
</p>
<p>if you knew."
</p>
<p>Paul did not reply, but kept looking into the speaker's face.
</p>
<p>" We detectives always have secrets," he went on, " and the one
</p>
<p>I am about to impart would speedily put a hangman's noose over
</p>
<p>my head if it was known beyond these walls. I am Maxon."
</p>
<p>The youth, not prepared for such a revelation, almost started
</p>
<p>from his chair.
</p>
<p>" Do you mean to say that Davis wants you to hunt down and
</p>
<p>hang yourself?" he cried.
</p>
<p>"He means that and nothing less," was the quiet answer. "I
</p>
<p>fear that, as Maxon, the Tennessean, I took one step too many, but
</p>
<p>THE WaR LIBBAKY.
</p>
<p>Union in this country. I thank God for that ! Thousands of blue-
</p>
<p>coats and gray-jaokets hare fallen in battle; but the end is near
</p>
<p>at hand. It is to be an end that will shook the world. One man
</p>
<p>has sworn to make history that will never be forgotten ; he has
</p>
<p>recorded in Heaven an oath before which you would stand
</p>
<p>aghast. You want me to tell you what that oath is, for unless you
</p>
<p>know, neither you nor auy one else can frustrate him. But I can-
</p>
<p>not tell you what it is."
</p>
<p>"Very well," said the war detective, calmly. "This is your
</p>
<p>final report, I suppose. For this I have overstayed roy time In the
</p>
<p>rebel capital, and disobeyed my superior."
</p>
<p>There was a tinge of bitterness in Oantwell's tones.
</p>
<p>" Cantwell, Cantwell ! I am oath-bound as to the awful scheme
</p>
<p>afoot," cried the mysterious Tomau. " Would to Heaven I had
</p>
<p>died before I took the vow. I followed him too closely. I ferreted
</p>
<p>him out wherever he went. I have been his shadow for days. He
</p>
<p>is in Richmond now ; but he may not be here at daylight."
</p>
<p>Paul laid his hand on the door-knob, for an almost uncontrolla-
</p>
<p>ble impulse was forcing him into the room where Cantwell faced
</p>
<p>his excited visitor.
</p>
<p>" Ha! he turned ou you when you got too close, eh?" said Cant-
</p>
<p>well, in a voice that kept Paul back.
</p>
<p>"Yes, yes."
</p>
<p>" And he bound you to secrecy by an oath 7"
</p>
<p>" Au oath that rings in my ears this moment."
</p>
<p>" Go over it in your mind. He swore you not to reveal his plot;
</p>
<p>not to expose his scheme. Dare you reveal his name? It you
</p>
<p>dare, speak out, and leave the rest to me."
</p>
<p>Paul could see that the detective's eyes seemed to burn their
</p>
<p>way through the veil that hid the woman's face.
</p>
<p>She rose slowly from the chair and threw a right hand heaven-
</p>
<p>ward.
</p>
<p>" Record it against me. Heaven, if in speaking his name I break
</p>
<p>my oath," she said, solemnly. " He swore me not to reveal what I

<p>had heard and seen. I will take upon myself the responsibility of
</p>
<p>speaking his name. If I violate the awful vow he forced from my
</p>
<p>lips, may the penalty he attached to it be visited upon my head."
</p>
<p>Cantwell looked like a man who had triumphed.
</p>
<p>The uplifted arm dropped at the woman's side again, and her
</p>
<p>kidden face was turned upon the detective.
</p>
<p>"His name now?"
</p>
<p>"John Wilkes Booth!"
</p>
<p>The name seemed to flud an echo in Paul's heart.
</p>
<p>"Ho!" he ejaculated; "was all that theatrical display for the
</p>
<p>jiurpose of meutiouing that name? I've seen the fellow on the
</p>
<p>boards. "
</p>
<p>As for CMiilwell, l:e had niaili' no reply to the revelation, and it
</p>
<p>'tvas easy to see that the name of the young actor had strangely
</p>
<p>impressed him.
</p>
<p>The time was near when it would startle a world.

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>THE BIT OF PAPER.
</p>
<p>.lohn Wilkes Booth !
</p>
<p>What was there in the sound of that name at that
</p>
<p>any one ?
</p>
<p>He was an actor of some repute, who had starred with success
</p>
<p>through the principal cities of the North, drawing crowds as
</p>
<p>much by the fame of his father as by his own merits.
</p>
<p>He was known everywhere as the son of Junius Brutus Booth, a
</p>
<p>tragedian of note, and one of the greatest Richards the stage has
</p>
<p>ever seen.
</p>
<p>His friends knew that his heart was wrapped up in the cause of
</p>
<p>the Confederacy, but not one of them dreamed that he was about
</p>
<p>to establish hi;-, fame in a manner which would cover his name
</p>
<p>with curses for all time to come.
</p>
<p>Paul, the youth who even laughed at the veiled woman's rela-
</p>
<p>tion, knew Booth ; he had seen him act, and had a passing ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance with him.
</p>
<p>THE WAR LIBRARY.
</p>
<p>" I know that Grant's life ia threatened. Men skv i.peiily here
</p>
<p>that he will never live to take Lee's sword. "
</p>
<p>" Tell me the man who said that. You have been in Biehtnoud
</p>
<p>long enough to know the prominent Confederates. Can you name
</p>
<p>theman who threatened Grant?"
</p>
<p>" I can do so. It was Colonel Opal a mau whom you must
</p>
<p>know."
</p>
<p>" Colonel Opal!" echoed Cantwell. " "SVhy, tliat man presented
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth with a magnificent wardrobe for Richard III. when
</p>
<p>he last played in Richmond. What do you think now, Paul ?"
</p>
<p>" It proves nothing. I do not see how you can connect Colonel
</p>
<p>Opal's boast with the wild scheme Pauline ascribes to Booth's
</p>
<p>brain."
</p>
<p>The detective was silent.
</p>
<p>" This Colonel Opal is a flre-eater of the first class," he said, after
</p>
<p>awhile. " I have made a study of him during your absence from
</p>
<p>tliecity. He is capable of really doing something desperate. 1
</p>
<p>liave my doubts whether he is altogether in his right mind."
</p>
<p>"Then his boasts and threats amount to nothiug."
</p>
<p>Cantwell slowly shook his head.
</p>
<p>"There may be a method in his madness, ' he said. "Since you
</p>
<p>know liim, let me ask if you have ever seen any of his hand-
</p>
<p>writing '/'
</p>
<p>"I have seen a good deal of it."
</p>
<p>" Enough to recognize a specimen of it if one were placed before
</p>
<p>him?"
</p>
<p>" I think so."
</p>
<p>Cantwell made no reply but drew from his pocket a slip of
</p>
<p>paper, which had been torn into three pieces, but was now a
</p>
<p>whole, liaviug been piisted together.
</p>
<p>He stepped to the talile and laid the paper under the lamp,
</p>
<p>knowing that tlie young man had followed him and was then at
</p>
<p>his side.
</p>
<p>"Is that in Colonel Opal's handwriting:'" queried Cantwell,

<p>glancing fiom the paper to Paul. "Bend down and view it closely.
</p>
<p>It is written with a pencil. Look sharp, my boy. What's the
</p>
<p>matter ? You're losing color again."
</p>
<p>It was true that Paul Phillips' face was quite white, and his eyes
</p>
<p>wliiih seemed ready to leap from his head, were staring at the
</p>
<p>little piece of paper Cantwell's hands were holding on the table.
</p>
<p>" That's not Colonel Opal's chirography. He never wrote a line
</p>
<p>of it ! ' said Paul, finding his tongue.
</p>
<p> Whose is itl' Do you know?"
</p>
<p> Yes. It ia Wilkes Booth's!"
</p>
<p>t'iiui well's hands left the table: he straightened up and whirled
</p>
<p>" Are you sure that Wilkes Booth penned that line?" he asketl.
</p>
<p>" I :iiii. My brother used to correspond with him. I am familial
</p>
<p>with his writing. I would swear to that terrible sentence beiinr
</p>
<p>from his hand."
</p>
<p>Cantwell turned to the paper and read its single line with flash-
</p>
<p>ing eyes.
</p>
<p>I'.ri.^i it was:
</p>
<p>" .\BRAHAM Lincoln; Died, March 4, 1805."
</p>
<p>I'anI looked at the detective as if he were trying lo intercept the
</p>
<p>thoughts passing through his brain.
</p>
<p>" 111 make that sentence a lie!" grated Cantwell, suddenly, be-
</p>
<p>tween clinched teeth. " Paul, you go at once to Washington."
</p>
<p>"To Washington? 
</p>
<p>" To Colonel Baker."
</p>
<p>The war detective picked up the startling paper and threw him-
</p>
<p>^elf into a chair at the table.
</p>
<p>Then he drew writing materials to him, and wrote rapidly in
</p>
<p>cypher for five minutes.
</p>
<p>" Now, sir, to Baker !" he said, rising and thrusting what he had
</p>
<p>written into Paul's hands. "Yon are not to say a word to any
</p>
<p>living creature about the contents of the paper I have shown you.
</p>
<p>Baker will give you something to do till I come. If Wilkes Booth
</p>
<p>wrote that sentence, there's something in his wild scheme. To
</p>
<p>Washington !"
</p>
<p>THE WAR LIBRARY.
</p>
<p>" Forewarned is forearmed; thanks," said Paul, moving off with
</p>
<p>hia face Btill turned toward his oonfronter. " If you will give me
</p>
<p>your name and address, I will send lyou a message when I get to
</p>
<p>Washington."
</p>
<p>He knew well the road he was traveling, for he had traversed it
</p>
<p>before, going to and from Grant's army, and had braved its
</p>
<p>Hangers on many occasions.
</p>
<p>It is needless to say that his eyes were on the alert, and that the
</p>
<p>revolver he had drawn on his late tracker he kept cocked in his
</p>
<p>right hand in order that it might be ready for use at a second's
</p>
<p>notice.
</p>
<p>He believed that his trailer, who appeared to be not only young
</p>
<p>but very handsome, with an effeminate oast of countenance, had
</p>
<p>gone back with his report to the person whom he undoubtedly
</p>
<p>served.
</p>
<p>This was true.
</p>
<p>While Paul was facing the dangers that lay between him aud the
</p>
<p>Confederate picket lines that compassed Richmond, his trailer was
</p>
<p>making his way back to the heart of the city proper.
</p>
<p>"I wonder what he will say when I report ?" the young person
</p>
<p>aaid, in audible tones, which were not intended for any other ears
</p>
<p>than his own. " Will it not hasten his departure from Richmond,
</p>
<p>and will he not frown at me when I tell him that Paul Phillips is
</p>
<p>actually on his way to Washington with a message from Silas Cant-
</p>
<p>well to Baker, his chief? I am not obliged to tell him all. I will
</p>
<p>report only what I see proper to let out and nothing more. He must
</p>
<p>not leave Riclimoud now unless he gives me permistion to accom-
</p>
<p>pany him."
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the speaker entered a plain frame dwelling in
</p>
<p>the best built portion of the Confederate city, and walked into the
</p>
<p>presence of a man writing at a table whose lamp threw a ruddy
</p>
<p>light over his handsome face.
</p>
<p>Handsome, we say.
</p>
<p>It was a face of the Doric type, faultless In every respect, and
</p>
<p>holder.

<p>calculated to win at once and retain the admiration of every be-
</p>
<p>The windows of this beautiful human castle were two dark
</p>
<p>eyes that were piercing, yet at the same time not harsh in stare
</p>
<p>nor glance.
</p>
<p>They meant, as has been said of them, " to woman, snare, and to
</p>
<p>man, a search warrant."
</p>
<p>A lofty forehead aud 8<|uare brows were adorned with curling
</p>
<p>hair, dark as the raven's feathers, and a mustache of the same
</p>
<p>oolor hid n part ot his well-shaped mouth.
</p>
<p>This man was well dressed in a suit of dark clothes that fitted to
</p>
<p>a nicety his well-developed and shapely figure, aa it was revealed
</p>
<p>in the chair.
</p>
<p>He looked up, aud his eyes shone pleasantly as the door opened,
</p>
<p>admitting to his presence the young person who had tracked Paul
</p>
<p>to the suburbs of Richmond ; aud laying his pen aside he addressed
</p>
<p>his visitor in that voice which always won those who heard it.
</p>
<p>" You aro welcome here, Stella," hesaid. " I have written some-
</p>
<p>thing here which I will read to you. But why those garments?"
</p>
<p>and the speaker looked sharply at the clothes, a close-fitting suit of
</p>
<p>gray, worn by the persou before him.
</p>
<p>A slight flush reddened the youth's temples.
</p>
<p>" I have been working a little, that is all," was the reply. "I
</p>
<p>will tell you by and by."
</p>
<p>The man at the table laughed musically, as he answered :
</p>
<p>"You'd make a good Confederate soldier, Stella. But listen to
</p>
<p>what I have written," and he picked up a sheet ot paper on which
</p>
<p>the ink was hardly dry. " I will not read continuously," he went
</p>
<p>on ; " but only here and there where I think I may have said some
</p>
<p>forcible things."
</p>
<p>His visitor, undoubtedly a beautiful young girl, as the lamp re-
</p>
<p>vealed, composed herself to listen with her eyes fastened on his
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>" I have called my paper 'To whom it may concern,' " he said.
</p>
<p>"Now listen to this my dear Stella:

</p>
<p>coloner: reaolutely. "If you are determiued to leave Riihiimiiu
</p>
<p>you cau set out with the assurance that Silas Cantwell, the Yan-
</p>
<p>kee agent, will be attended to with neatness and dispatch. He'll
</p>
<p>never get to make his report, or my name's not Lovelace Opal !"
</p>
<p>"Don't spoil matters by being too fast," advised the plotter.
</p>
<p>" Unless Silas Cant well, as I chose to call him, is put out of the
</p>
<p>way at once, the South may never be avenged. I leave all with
</p>
<p>you, colonel. You know your duty, and future generations will
</p>
<p>curse you if you do it not."
</p>
<p>"I shall not fail," was the reassuring reply. "I don't know
</p>
<p>what you are going to do, Wilkes ; but whatever it is, do it well."
</p>
<p>Booth's eyes glistened.
</p>
<p>"Well done it shall be!" he said, holding out his hand. "I pc
</p>
<p>back to those who will help me carry out my scheme. The great 
</p>
<p>est scheme afoot will thrive henceforward in the shadow of the
</p>
<p>Northern capital. Listen for news from the North, colonel. The
</p>
<p>ides of March aie going to be fatal to the modern Cajsar. Don't
</p>
<p>forget my last injunction, colonel. Attend to Silas Cantwell. He's
</p>
<p>a poisonous weed that has thrived too long on Southern soil."
</p>
<p>The Confederate citizen wrung Booth's hand cordially, and fol-
</p>
<p>lowed him to the door after he had dropped it.

</p>
<p>Booth crossed the threshold as the last word fell from his lips,
</p>
<p>and having again bade him good-by. Colonel Opal turned back
</p>
<p>into his house.

<p>^ith all his secrets, as I discover, although he leads one up to them
</p>
<p>sometimes. The South has suffered and is to be avenged ; that's
</p>
<p>the burden of his song. I never thought that Wilkes Booth would
</p>
<p>undertake a scheme as dark as the one he talks about seems to be.
</p>
<p>If he would listen to that girl, who would die for him, he could
</p>
<p>make himself the happiest man in all creation ; but he wants
</p>
<p>lame  fame! By. love! he may get the rope and infamy, if he
</p>
<p>doesn't mend his ways. Let me see : what am I to do? Oh, yes,
</p>
<p>I'm expected to have Silas Cantwell hanged before he gets back.
</p>
<p>Silas Cantwell a Yankee agent? Well, I don't know. It takes a
</p>
<p>good deal of grit for a Northern agent to live six months in Rich-
</p>
<p>mond; but Silas Cant well's expressionless face and cold eyes were
</p>
<p>not made to be owned by a coward. Wilkes has pitted me against
</p>
<p>that man. eh ? What are VQU going to do with the job, colonel ?"
</p>
<p>Before < o/onel Opul answered the self put question, he consulted
</p>
<p>H well stocked sideboard, from whose contents he selected some
</p>
<p>liquor, that added a new sparkle to hib eyes.
</p>
<p>" I am going to obey, Wilkes," he said, replacing the decanter on
</p>
<p>its accustomed shelf. " I have made up my mind that Silas Cant-
</p>
<p>well shall never present his report to his chief."
</p>
<p>This resolve was easily made, although the maker might ex-
</p>
<p>perience difficulty in carrying it out.
</p>
<p>Colonel Opal had never married, although his large wealth, and
</p>
<p>\iot his face, which was not very handsome, had attracted many
</p>
<p>marriageable ladies.
</p>
<p>His house was one of the finest dwellings in the rebel capital, and
</p>
<p>was always open to those who loved the cause almost lost.
</p>
<p>Colonel Opal knew where the war detective dwelt, for on one oc-
</p>
<p>casion a few days prior to the opening of our story, he had visited
</p>
<p>Cantwell at home, and enjoyed a chat with the spy whom he did
</p>
<p>not then suspect.
</p>
<p>"Grass mustn't grow under one's feet these times," he said, to.
</p>
<p>himself, as he selected a revolver from among a dozen weapons,
</p>
<p>shortly after Booth's departure, "By Jove! it's past midnight
</p>
<p>now; but what of that? I must lirst find whether Silas is at home,
</p>
<p>THE WAR LIBRARY.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps."
</p>
<p>" You took the risk and lost, colonel," the detective smiled,
</p>
<p>faintly. " You see I get letters by the secret mail as well as other
</p>
<p>people. But let us come to other matters. I am your prisoner, if
</p>
<p>I look at this affair in the same light you do."
</p>
<p>" I consider you so."
</p>
<p>" Well, what lire you going to do with me ?"
</p>
<p>Colonel Opal made no immediate reply.
</p>
<p>It then began to dawn upon him that he probably had an ele-
</p>
<p>phant on his hands.
</p>
<p>He had captured Cantwell In the later's own quarters, and there
</p>
<p>was no one near to help take the prisoner to confinement.
</p>
<p>He thought he detected in the prisoner's question a tone of de-
</p>
<p>fiance which irritated him.
</p>
<p>" You have arrested me for being what you have pleased to term
</p>
<p>an agent of the North," continued Cantwell. "That is a bold
</p>
<p>charge, colonel. I would like to see your proofs. Of course you
</p>
<p>have not arrested me without something tangible to substantiate
</p>
<p>the charges you have preferred against me."
</p>
<p>"Proof?" echoed the Confederate, in a dazed sort of way.
</p>
<p>"Proof? We'll bring forward enough of it at the right time. I
</p>
<p>say again that you are Leon Lennox, not Silas Cantwell. By Jove I
</p>
<p>you may be Maxou, the Tennesseean, for aught I know."
</p>
<p>Colonel Opal expected to see the detective start at mention of
</p>
<p>the last name, but he did not.
</p>
<p>"I must be a man of many names if I am to believe my accus-
</p>
<p>ers," he merely said, a bit of merriment in his voice. " But a truce
</p>
<p>to all this ! Since I am to consider myself under arrest, I desire at
</p>
<p>once to be confronted by the proof of which you have spoken. 1

</p>
<p>Colonel Opal started.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Davis and I are friends," continued Cantwell. "I am at

<p>an interview. 'Die liour is late, 1 know, and the president has
</p>
<p>doubtless retired ; liut as your action is interfering with certain
</p>
<p>work I am now doing for him, 1 demand to be taken to his man-
</p>
<p>sion iit once."
</p>
<p>The Confederate citizen seemed staggered at these words.
</p>
<p>He began to think thnt after all Booth might have been hasty in
</p>
<p>accusiug Cantwell of being Leon Leuno.\, and a spy of the North.
</p>
<p>If he was guilty, why would he demand to be taken to President
</p>
<p>Davis, the highest authority in the Confederate capital, and a man
</p>
<p>who at that time was very an.xious to rid Richmond of everything
</p>
<p>not rebel?
</p>
<p>"Read that, sirl" said Cantwell, proudly, breakii.g in upon liis
</p>
<p>captor's speculations by flinging a letter upon the table. " As :i
</p>
<p>true Confederate, as I know you to be, you will not believe 1h:r
</p>
<p>i,i . Dii\ is hnunell would lie likely to entrust a mission of great
</p>
<p>importance to the cause to a Northern spy. That letter, sir, is a
</p>
<p>part of my defence."
</p>
<p>Cantwell eyed Opal closely, as the latter unfolded and read the
</p>
<p>letter, which we laid before the reader in our first chapter.
</p>
<p>He was well acquainted with the rebel president's chirography,
</p>
<p>and saw at once that the document he held in his hand was gen-
</p>
<p>uine.
</p>
<p>When he looked up, Cantwell's keen eyes saw that the mau was
</p>
<p>doubting.
</p>
<p>" Come, colonel, confess that you have acted hastily, or < onduct
</p>
<p>me to Mr. Davis, so that by a word he can sot all your doubts at
</p>
<p>rest. I'll get my hat and "
</p>
<p>Cantwell had left his chair in which he had seated himself after
</p>
<p>rising from the floor, and was moving across the room when Col-
</p>
<p>onel Opal with voice and spring broke his sentence.
</p>
<p>" One minute," he said, laying his hand ou the detective's shoul-
</p>
<p>der, which made him turn, bringing the two men face to face
</p>
<p>again. " I cannot think of disturbing the president at this hour."
</p>
<p>"Not when justice demands a hearing?" cried Cantwell, his eyes
</p>
<p>flashing madly. " Not when a citizen of Richmond is accused of

</p>
<p>sent that night to Washington. " Baker will receive Wilkes Bootb
</p>
<p>with open arms when he gets to the capital !"
</p>
<p>So saying, Cantwell closed the slide of his lantern and left the
</p>
<p>chamber lately occupied by Booth.
</p>
<p>When he reac aed the steps before the house, he locked the door
</p>
<p>by means of the false key and started off.

</p>
<p>Thrilled to his very soul, the war detec ive wheeled, with his
</p>
<p>hand on his revolver, to confront the speaker.
</p>
<p>" I thought it was you," said a voice, as a figure rose out of the
</p>
<p>almost rayless gloom. " I want to warn you now, Leon Lennox,
</p>
<p>that unless you give up your present plans, your life will not be
</p>
<p>wortli a farthing. Be warned in time. That's all!"
</p>
<p>The speaker wheeled to depart, but the detective's hand clutched
</p>
<p>his shoulder.
</p>
<p>"And I tell you, Wilkes Booth, that unless you put me out of
</p>
<p>your road, you'll never succeed in your damnable plots!" he
</p>
<p>grated.
</p>
<p>The reply was a cold, cutting, aud defiant laugh, and the loyal
</p>
<p>detective saw the great conspirator vanish, leaving him the sole
</p>
<p>occupant of the spot.

<p>CHAPTER VI.

<p>AT WORK IN WASHINGTON.
</p>
<p>The mouth of February was drawing to a close, and all Wash-

<p>The rebellion was about to collapse, and men were already talk-

<p>windows of liis magnanimous soul looking toward the smoky hori-
</p>
<p>zon, above which he felt would soon soar the angel of peace.
</p>
<p>No man had deplored the war more than he, and no heart in all
</p>
<p>the nation had bled oftener, or been wounded deeper than the one
</p>
<p>iu his bosom.
</p>
<p>One night, after the long, coobngshadows had settled down over
</p>
<p>the White House, a veiled womiiu presented herself at the main
</p>
<p>entrance, and requested an intervieT with the president.
</p>
<p>of ileen disappointment
</p>
<p>No more to-night, miss," answered the man, slightly emphasiz-
</p>
<p>ing the last word, as if he wished tliecallei- to know that, despite
</p>
<p>her veil, he had discovered her social title.
</p>
<p>' No more to-night!" was the echo.
</p>
<p>" But I must see him. I must liave an interview with the presi-
</p>
<p>dent."
</p>
<p>" I regret to say that you must postpone it. The president's in-
</p>
<p>auguration is approaching, and he finds a great deal to engross his
</p>
<p>attention.'
</p>
<p>The veiled woman started.
</p>
<p>"His second inauguration, yes," she exclaimed. "That is why I
</p>
<p>want to see him. This is the last day of February. I will waitout
</p>
<p>yonder until the cabinet meeting ends."
</p>
<p>The woman nodded toward the garden as she finished, but the
</p>
<p>man said firmly ;
</p>
<p>" It will be a long wait, I am afraid. Mr. Lincoln oannot be seen
</p>
<p>to-night. I am sorry, and I must tell you that people found in the
</p>
<p>grounds at night are apt to be disturbed by the capitol police."
</p>
<p>The veiled visitor stood still for a moment.
</p>
<p>" I am willing to lie subjected to arrest if I could only see the
</p>
<p>president," she pleaded, after a moment's silence.
</p>
<p>" Does he know you, miss?"
</p>
<p>"Alas! no. He has never so much as heard of me. Must I go,
</p>
<p>then, without seeing him 7 Must I depart without doing him the
</p>
<p>service which lies so near my heart ? Do any people ever come

<p>His eyes followed the pen she

<p>front of her.

<p>How they glittered as he glared at the writing which

<p>tif ul, like the ohirography of a cultivated woman.
</p>
<p>His presence, hideous as it was, was not suspected by the writer;
</p>
<p>the lamp that afforded light for the labor threw a pair of shadows
</p>
<p>on the wall; but she saw them not.
</p>
<p>All at once the brawny hand of the man was lifted, and the next
</p>
<p>moment it fell upon the woman's shoulder.
</p>
<p>The response was a wild cry, and the woman sprang up and
</p>
<p>whirled upon the human panther.
</p>
<p>"You here?" she demanded, with flashing eyes and crimsoned
</p>
<p>face. "Who are you, and what right haye you to invade my
</p>
<p>home?"
</p>
<p>Before the tracker replied, he glanced at the sheet halt written
</p>
<p>over on the table.
</p>
<p>Then he said :
</p>
<p>" You are going to give the whole thing away."
</p>
<p>The woman started as if a sentence of death had unexpectedly
</p>
<p>rang in her ears.
</p>
<p>"Don't lie to rae, girl," continued the Washington thug, ad-
</p>
<p>vancing upon her as a tiger approaches his victim. " You have
</p>
<p>been to the White House, but they would not let you in, so you
</p>
<p>come here and write out the secret to send to Lincoln if he refuses
</p>
<p>to admit you to-morrow. We can't be trifled with at this stage of
</p>
<p>the game. You know how traitors are punished."
</p>
<p>He pounced upon her with the last word, and before she could
</p>
<p>lift a hand, his flugers encircled her arm, and seemed to burn their
</p>
<p>way to the bone.
</p>
<p>" Who are you ?" gasped the girl, her veil oft now, revealing a
</p>
<p>beautiful face but divested of all color.

<p>would send to the gallows. I am Wilkes' friend. We're all in the

</p>
<p>The woman did not shriek at this awful announcement; she
</p>
<p>eould not, for the hand of the assassin was at her swan-like
</p>
<p>throat.
</p>
<p>He lifted her by main strength from the floor ; her eyes seemed

<p>lo start from her head.

<p>Vuit cipher message intrusted to his care by the war detective,
</p>
<p>what had become of hiui ?
</p>
<p>When we saw him last he was attempting to leave Richmond by
</p>
<p>a route which he had traveled before, and a route with which he
</p>
<p>was well acquainted.
</p>
<p>.\t last he had the city iu his rear, and for the first time since
</p>
<p>leaving, Silas Cantwell, as we prefer to call the war detective, he
</p>
<p>breathed free.
</p>
<p>Piiui stood in a road waich was illy bordered by a few trees,
</p>
<p>whose lowest limbs were beyond his reach, and as he listened, he
</p>
<p>heard the approach of a body of cavalry.
</p>
<p>Til .'lep behind the nearest tree was the work of an instant, and
</p>
<p>with his hand at bis revolver, which he had resolved not to use ex-
</p>
<p>cept in the case of extreme danger, the detective's messenger
</p>
<p>waited for the troop.
</p>
<p>Presently their outlines loomed up between the young loyalist
</p>
<p>uiid the scattering stars, and the next moment instead of passing
</p>
<p>the tree, as he bad expected, tliM foremost drew rein and said,
</p>
<p>laughingly to his twenty compaiiious;
</p>
<p>" It's not a case of life and death, lioys. Let's stop here awhile

<p>head of a luoifer match !
</p>
<p>Paul sprang to oue corner of his prison and knelt down with his
</p>
<p>)Hi-k toward the window.
</p>
<p>Then he drew the bit ot inatc^h along the floor, aud was reward-
</p>
<p>ed with the appearance of a flame.
</p>
<p>The message bail been snioolhed ou I before hand, and his eye-
</p>
<p>were ready to master it.
</p>
<p>Thereader can imagine the feelings of the young man when he
</p>
<p>lient to his task.
</p>
<p>It was not a hopeless one. for iu a moment, as it were, Paul with
</p>
<p>the aid of the match, had read the following:
</p>
<p>" Send word to Beauregard at once that you will translate the
</p>
<p>cipher at his headquartrs. A guard will come for you. There
</p>
<p>will be a demonstration at a certain alley. Leap away, and run
</p>
<p>down it to a gate which you will And open. It is your only hope.
</p>
<p>" A Friend."
</p>
<p>The match went out and left Paul iu darkness again, just as he
</p>
<p>reached the common place signature.
</p>
<p>If ever hej needed "a friend" it was at that very moment, but
</p>
<p>who was helping him ?
</p>
<p>The handwriting was not Cantwell's.
</p>
<p>Was it Pauline's ohirography ?
</p>
<p>He did not know.
</p>
<p>" I'll trust my friend," he said, half audibly. "I'll send word
</p>
<p>at once to the rebel chief.
</p>
<p>Tearing ihe message into fragments and thrusting them through
</p>
<p>a crevice in the floor, Paul called one of the guards iu the corridor
</p>
<p>outside, and cold h:rn that he had decided to translate the
</p>
<p>cipher.
</p>
<p>At last, after what seemed hours of waiting, although in reality
</p>
<p>not more than flfteen minutes haa passed, a commotion in the cor-
</p>
<p>ridor told him that a number oi soldiers had arrived.
</p>
<p>When the door opened, the light ot a lantern permeated the
</p>
<p>room, and Paul was told to step forth, which he promptly did.

</p>
<p>Tbe detective did not suspect that he was followed, fur he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded quite leisurely along the areuue, aud did not pause until
</p>
<p>he reached n small frame house a short distance from the capitol
</p>
<p>itse4f.
</p>
<p>For the first time casting about him to see that be was not ob-
</p>
<p>served by any suspicious characters, he entered by means of a key
</p>
<p>which he took from beneath the step, and, to Payne's chagrin,
</p>
<p>Jocked the door behind him.
</p>
<p>if " I can watch," said the tracker, smothering his disappointment.
</p>
<p>" He hasn't entered that house to sptnd the night there. Knowing
</p>
<p>what he does about my master's plot, he bas come to Washington
</p>
<p>to work, not to rest."
</p>
<p>The watoher had taken up his station under a large shade-tree a
</p>
<p>few yai-ds from the house from whence, well hidden by its trunk,
</p>
<p>he ctouM watch the door for Cautwell's reappearance.
</p>
<p>His eyes told that he was sure of his victim, aud they did not
</p>
<p>abate their confidence as the minutes wore away.
</p>
<p>Not until an hour had passed did Booth's thug show signs of
</p>
<p>restlessness.
</p>
<p>What had become of Silas Cantwell ?
</p>
<p>"I'd give a hundred dollars to he in that house a minute," he
</p>
<p>said to himself. " He cauuot have lef t it. I have not taken my
</p>
<p>eyes from the door for a moment. It is not possible  "
</p>
<p>At that very momeut the door opened, and a man who did not
</p>
<p>in the least particle resemble the war detective came out, and
</p>
<p>halted on the step for a moment.
</p>
<p>Payne leaned forward and eyed the man with breathless curi-
</p>
<p>osity.
</p>
<p>He looked fully two inches shorter than Cantwell ; his face was
</p>
<p>covered with a thick iron-gray beard as the rays of the nearest
</p>
<p>lamp showed the tracker, and he looked almost twenty years
</p>
<p>older than the war detective.
</p>
<p>" The sleuth-hound in a new skin that's all," ejaculated Payne,

<p>smiling triumphantly as he watched the man. " If I kill you, my
</p>
<p>good fellow, I put Silas Cantwell forever out of our way. You did
</p>
<p>deo^vemefor a moment, but I'm on the right track again. Ha!
</p>
<p>off you go!"
</p>
<p>The last exclamation was caused by the watched man leaving the
</p>
<p>step, and when he had proceeded a short distance, Payne sprang
</p>
<p>after him with the same noiseless, tigerish tread.
</p>
<p>The hour was not late, and the avenue was thronged with peo-
</p>
<p>ple; but nobody seemed to notice the thug and bis marked victim,
</p>
<p>neither did the former lose sight of his man.
</p>
<p>' What! does ho know where Wilkes is to be found ?" suddenly
</p>
<p>cried Payne, as his victim immediatedly started across the thor,
</p>
<p>oughfare. " I am sure that he hasn't been two hours in Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, and yet he strikes out for the master's quartei-s."
</p>
<p>Cantwell, for we may as well acknowledge that the tracked man
</p>
<p>is the war detective, had slightly increased his gait, and Payne, in
</p>
<p>turn, did thi; same.
</p>
<p>All at once he stopped before 'a closed door, which appeared to
</p>
<p>bar one's way to the upper stories of the building he then faced,
</p>
<p>and a glance at the number, readable on the transom, seemed to
</p>
<p>satisfy him.
</p>
<p>Payne, with excited countenance, was now not more than thirty
</p>
<p>feet away, breathing hard, and grinding his teeth like a maddened
</p>
<p>tiger.
</p>
<p>" How does he know that Wilkes is up there V ho shot out from
</p>
<p>between his clinched teeth. " What infernal fate is conspiring
</p>
<p>agaitut us by bringing that man to Washington, when we thought
</p>
<p>him dead ? He told Wilkes in Richmond thathe'd have to kill him
</p>
<p>if he wanted to succeed in his scheme against the president. I see
</p>
<p>that we'll have to do that, for while he lives, Lincoln lives !"
</p>
<p>Payne had scarcely ceased, ere Cantwell laid his hand ou the
</p>
<p>white knob at the side of the door, and pulled it toward him.
</p>
<p>With the blade of a formidable dirk along his arm, he crept for-
</p>
<p>ward in the shadow of the houses, his eyes fastened on Cantwell,
</p>
<p>and his whole nature roused to the work he was about to do.

<p>CHAPTER XI.
</p>
<p>AT WORK AGAIN.
</p>
<p>Thus the great inaugural day was tided over, thanks to Silas
</p>
<p>Cantwell, without a tragedy to clothe the whole land in mourn-
</p>
<p>ing, and to shock the world.
</p>
<p>The war detective, escaping from the toils lu wliich the plotters
</p>
<p>had enveloped him in Richmond, had reached Washington in time
</p>
<p>to frustrate Booth's first attempt.
</p>
<p>Would he be as successful iu dealing with tlin secoud one?
</p>
<p>We shall see.
</p>
<p>One of the proudest mtn who witnessed the inauguration cere-
</p>
<p>monies was the detective himself.
</p>
<p>He knew that Booth and his co-plotters would shrink from mur-
</p>
<p>der on that day, since the government detective force was on the
</p>
<p>alert, and ready to baffle any and all attempts at assassination.
</p>
<p>He was net sure that Booth was notiu Washiugton, for, although
</p>
<p>warned that his plans were known, the plotter would be hard to
</p>
<p>drive far from the capital, especially when he had at his command
</p>
<p>a score of hding-plaoes of which Cantwell kuew nothing.
</p>
<p>A week passed away, a week of secret meetings and new plot.",
</p>
<p>new plans.
</p>
<p>Tt was the night of the last day of the week following the inau-
</p>
<p>gural, when a mau dismounted from a horse in front of an old
</p>
<p>hotel in a well known village ten miles south-east of Washington.
</p>
<p>He was melon the steps before the house by a youth of fifteen,
</p>
<p>who took his horse and led him away, while the man pushed his
</p>
<p>way into the house without announcing his presence by any raps.

<p>" Ah I here you are on time, " exclaimed a woman's voice when
</p>
<p>the man had shut tiie door behind him. " You are never late."
</p>
<p>"Punctuality is one of my favorite loves," was the reply, as the
</p>
<p>man doffed his hat and steiipeU inlu ;i plainly lui iiiilitil room
</p>
<p>whose lamp instantly revealed him as Wilkes Booth.
</p>
<p>The woman who followed him into the room was large, well
</p>
<p>formed, and, though a trifle past middle age, still quite handsome.
</p>
<p>Her hair was brushed back, displaying a good forehead, and the
</p>
<p>simple dress she wore lent a motherly charm to her appearance.
</p>
<p>No one would have suspected at first glance that this woman
</p>
<p>had plotted with Booth against the life of a president, that the
</p>
<p>secret meetings of the conspirators had taken place under her root
</p>
<p>from the Inception of the plot, and that she had trained her chil-
</p>
<p>dren to hate with her the life of such a ruler as the martyr Lin-
</p>
<p>coln.
</p>
<p>That woman was Mrs. Surratt, the village Surrattaville, and the
</p>
<p>house .Tohn Lloyd's hotel, which, in reality, belonged to the
</p>
<p>Booth's oountenanoe still showed the deep cliagriii to which
</p>
<p>Cant well's work had subjected him.
</p>
<p>He sent several searching glances around the room as he en-
</p>
<p>tered, and seeing that he and Mrs. Surratt were its only oooupants,
</p>
<p>he turned to her and said :
</p>
<p>" Has the new map arrived ?"
</p>
<p>" It came to-day," was the answer, and turning away the wom-
</p>
<p>an left Booth alone.
</p>
<p>For several minutes the doomed young actor stood where he had
</p>
<p>Drst halted, then he stepped hastily to one of the windows, as
</p>
<p>though a footfall had sounded on his guilty ears.
</p>
<p>" A few more days and we will win," he murmured. " Of course
</p>
<p>we'll all receive the eternal condemnation of the North, but what
</p>
<p>of that 7 We'll win everlasting fame by the deed, and the un-
</p>

</p>
<p>faraway. By Jove! if she's as fair as Psyche, I will not fcesitau-
</p>
<p>to send her to Hades!"
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt saw him bound across the thr-jshold like a mad-
</p>
<p>man, leaving her breathless and alarmed in the room.
</p>
<p>' Is he mad ?" she exclaimed. " What if one of his old loves ha.s
</p>
<p>discovered the secret, and threatens to betray iis all? Great Uod !
</p>
<p>the deepest swamp iu Maryland would prove no asylum !"
</p>
<p>.\8 for Booth, he had already reached the open air, and stood
</p>
<p>near a tree, listening, with his fingei- at the trigger of a revolver
</p>
<p>he had drawn.
</p>
<p>All at once he heard the gallopiu;: of a liorae.
</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer it came, from the direction of Washington.
</p>
<p>Most certainly the rider's destination was the house he had just
</p>
<p>vacated.
</p>
<p>Without stirring in his tracks, the actor-assassin listened to the
</p>
<p>hoof beats, which scarcely drowned the throbs of his own heart.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the horse and his rider loomed up before him, and a
</p>
<p>man lauded on the ground at his feet.
</p>
<p>"Here I am," said Booth, his band falliug heavily 6u the man's
</p>
<p>shoulder. " What brings you hither, boy?"
</p>
<p>Before there was a reply of any kind, the person addressed
</p>
<p>started as if the hand of the dead had touched him.
</p>
<p>"By George! you frightened me," he said. " 1 have news for

</p>
<p>"Silas Cautwell has come back to Washington, and Vaul is with
</p>
<p>him."

<p>Booth received the tidings with a slight start, which the night
</p>
<p>kept from Harold's eyes.

<p>pause. ' V woman seems to he hunting you."

</p>
<p>"She is tall and beautifully fornie<l. Her face I did not see, for
</p>
<p>she kept it covered."

</p>
<p>breath, aud he crushed the mysterious note madly in his hand.

<p>A DARK COMMISSION.
</p>
<p>For a moment after Booth's lust word, there wassilenee between
</p>
<p>the two men.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, Booth said, looking into Harold's face:
</p>
<p>"Go back lo Washington at once. Find Payne, and tell him to
</p>
<p>keep track of faiitwell and Paul. I will look after the woman.
</p>
<p>Not a moment is lo be lost. Go!"
</p>
<p>The plotters words, spoken in tones nt signitlcance, told Harold
</p>
<p>that no time was to be thrown away.
</p>
<p>Was the great plot on the eve of fiiilureagain?
</p>
<p>With a look at Booth, the messenger turned to mount the steed,
</p>
<p>whose bridle rein he had held all the time.
</p>
<p>"No grass shall grow under my feet," he said. "I will find
</p>
<p>Payne, and I will help him baffle Silas Cantwell."
</p>
<p>"You? No. I have other work for you. Payne will be more
</p>
<p>than a match for those two men."
</p>
<p>It was evident that Booth did not trust Harold implicitly, since
</p>
<p>he admitted Cantwell into the house on the avenue the night that
</p>
<p>witnessed the overthrow of the scheme to culminate in assassina-
</p>
<p>tion on the fourth of March.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt had heard the horse that had carried Harold from
</p>
<p>Washington, t>ut she had failed to catch the conversation which
</p>
<p>had passed between the two men.
</p>
<p>Booth did uot choose to relieve her anxiety when he rejoined
</p>
<p>her in the parlor; on the contrary, he mystifled her still more.

</p>
<p>him. With that knife I could fight my way through the czar's

<p>guards to the throne itself."
</p>
<p>That terrible knife was enough to make one shudder; but Booth
</p>
<p>manifested no emotion while he gazed upon it.
</p>
<p>It was a dirk which had become historical, for with it Lewis
</p>
<p>Payne afterward cut his way to Secretary Seward's bedside,

<p>tongue.
</p>
<p>" Is he here yet ?"
</p>
<p> Yes. I had difflculty in avoiding him to-night. He's been

<p>frighten him out of his wits."

<p>"Where is he now?"

<p>" I'll read him a lecture he'll never forget," he contiuued, mad-

<p>ly. " I wish I had never met the old fool."

<p>" Leave him to me also," said Payne, with a Bignifleant look.

<p>" Don't kill him, Payne."

<p>sion, or I'll apply a remedy that will forever silence your raving
</p>
<p>Cantwell saw, and (lie colonel did, too, the long dirk that left its
</p>
<p>hiding place as the last words fell from Payne's lips.
</p>
<p>The detective prepared to spring forward.
</p>
<p>"Go to Richmond, or receive the length of this!" hissed Payne,
</p>
<p>in tones well calculated lo cow even a courageous man. " I am a
</p>
<p>man of action, as well as words, colonel. I've carried my life in
</p>
<p>my hands for many years, but you shall not consign all of us to
</p>
<p>the gallows. To Richmond !"
</p>
<p>Colonel Opal recoiled a step as the blade gleamed in his face.
</p>
<p>"I go I o Richmond, but first take this, scoundrel!" he said, and
</p>
<p>the next sei-ond, before Payne could prepare for what was com-
</p>
<p>ing, his right hand shot forward with the force of a stone hurled
</p>
<p>from a catapult.
</p>
<p>" Now I can go to Richmond with a clear conscience," said the
</p>
<p>Southerner, gazing for a moment upon the form of his victim. " I
</p>
<p>never exposed their jjlot. He trumped up a lie in order to get to
</p>
<p>kill me. By Heaven! I hope the Yankee government will choke
</p>
<p>him first when it begins to hang. Now for Richmond, colonel. It
</p>
<p>will be a rainy day when you set foot in Washington again."
</p>
<p>" That's a sound resolve," said a voice that made the colonel
</p>
<p>start back.

</p>
<p>" My God ! who are you ?" he gasped.
</p>
<p>Cantwell stood before him.
</p>
<p>" I'm a gentleman who wishes you to keep that resolution," re-
</p>
<p>plied the detective. " I thank you for the blow you dealt to-night.
</p>
<p>One of its magnitude was never more deserved. There'll be a big
</p>
<p>hanging spree here before long unless some human devils are
</p>
<p>thwarted. Rebel though you are, colonel, I don't want to see you
</p>
<p>stretch hemp, for I've had some pleasant times with you."
</p>
<p>" Silas Cantwell!" ejaculated the colonel.
</p>
<p>" Yes, Silas Cantwell, the Yankee agent, whom you met in Rich-
</p>
<p>mond," smiled Cantwell. " Go home at once. When that Tillain
</p>
<p>on the grass recovers he'll want more blood than even you can
</p>
<p>furnish."
</p>
<p>" I'm off, Cantwell off for Richmond."
</p>
<p>Colonel Opal turned away as he finished, and the war dete<'tive
</p>
<p>did not detain him.
</p>
<p>A moment later Cantwell was left alone.
</p>
<p>After a hasty but searching glance around, he approached Payne,
</p>
<p>who had fallen in a deep shadow, and lay with his already swollen
</p>
<p>face upturned to the leaves.
</p>
<p>Stooping over him the detective searched his pockets carefully,
</p>
<p>but discovered no papers of any kind.
</p>
<p>" A murderer by profession, he carries no damaging papers on his
</p>
<p>person," said Cantwell, relinquishiug the search. "He won't
</p>
<p>know himself when he consults a mirror. Thanks to Colonel Opal's
</p>
<p>muscle," and smiling to himself, the detective turned from the
</p>
<p>spot and walked toward the avenue.
</p>
<p>He would have smiled just the same if the big Virginian'e blow
</p>
<p>had kihed the desperado of the capital.

<p>and begged to be adiiiitted to LiiiiMilus presence; for what? To
</p>
<p>give the whole plot away. I happened to be where I oould aid
</p>
<p>you, Wilkes. That peraou was to have returned the next day, but
</p>
<p>there was no return. Why not ? Because that night a boat was
</p>
<p>rowed out into the Potomac, ^nd a human body dropped from It
</p>
<p>into the current which tells no tales of betrayal.
</p>
<p>" Of course I thank you, Payne," said Booth. "Now let mehear
</p>
<p>the name of the would-be betrayer."
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne did not speak.
</p>
<p>He seemed to move nearer the door.
</p>
<p>" Who was he ?" persisted the actor.
</p>
<p>"No! Tou will not let Harold jro, and I i>an keep my .seoret,"
</p>
<p>was the answer, as the door opened.
</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Wilkes. I wisli you success, but you will
</p>
<p>please excuse Lewis Payne from all future service in the scheme."
</p>
<p>As the last word died away, the door shut in Booth's face, and
</p>
<p>the footsteps that went down the stairs told him that Payne, his
</p>
<p>riRht hand man, was gone.
</p>
<p>"Let hira go!" he suddenly exclaimed. "I am not going to
</p>
<p>knuckle to a man like Lewis Payne. I am ready to move to my
</p>
<p>goal alone, with the avenging pistol in my hand. He is only doins
</p>
<p>what Mr*. Surratt said he might do iu a passion. She has warned
</p>
<p>me of lliis outbreak of mutiny. Colonel Opal's blow has mad-
</p>
<p>denefl li 1111. and he had to take his spite out on someone. He has
</p>
<p>chosen Harold as his victim, but I will not dismiss the young man,
</p>
<p>not even it I lose Payne by clinging to him. He will cool down
</p>
<p>before niglit. He will whimper at my feet again, and beg me to
</p>
<p>forget this scene. But if he does not, 1 will carry out my schemes
</p>
<p>without him. I have sworn to kill the man in the White House,
</p>
<p>and a hundred desertions shall not balk me!"
</p>
<p>Booth stepped to the window as he let the last word fall from
</p>
<p>his lips, and gazed down upon the street below.
</p>
<p>All at once his eyes seemed to emit sparks of fire, and stepping

<p>back he snatched a revolver from the table.
</p>
<p>Then he leaped to the window again and threw up the sagh.
</p>
<p>At that moment an open carriage, guarded by a little troop of
</p>
<p>cavalry appeared opposite the window.
</p>
<p>The occupants of the vehicle were Mr. Lincohi and his son. Tad,
</p>
<p>on their way to the capitoi.
</p>
<p>What an opportunity for Booth to do his terril>le work !
</p>
<p>But he lowered the revolver which he had suddenly raised
</p>
<p>against the president, and watched the carriage roll on.
</p>
<p>"Not now," he said. " A few more days, Mr. Lincoln, aud the
</p>
<p>imperious North will kneel at your bloody bier."
</p>
<p>That was prophecy.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV.
</p>
<p>A TOUCHING APPEAL.
</p>
<p>Did Payne come back to the ambitions man he had sworn to aid
</p>
<p>in the blackest plot that stains the page of history?
</p>
<p>Before we answer this question, let us look upon a scene which
</p>
<p>should have turned the murderer's feet from his victim, and
</p>
<p>iiiove<l a heart of stone.
</p>
<p>More than one journey Booth made alone to Surrattsville during
</p>
<p>the days that followed his exciting scene with Payne.
</p>
<p>He met more than one person under the roof of Lloyd's hotel.
</p>
<p>There came to him persons whose names were heralded to the
</p>
<p>world m tlie last smoke of the rel>ellion.
</p>
<p>There were sc<-rct conferences at night under that roof, maps
</p>
<p>were exaraim-il, roads traced with the fingers, and questions asked
</p>
<p>and answereil.
</p>
<p>What did it all mean?
</p>
<p>Simply that Wilkes Booth was at work.
</p>
<p>Not for a single moment had lii> aliaiidone.. tlie wild scheme
</p>
<p>born into his imaginative brain.
</p>
<p>Payne, the desperado, had deserted him, but what of that?
</p>
<p>There were others who hated Abraham Lincoln and his cause
</p>
<p>enough to help him in an assassination plot.
</p>
<p>He still had Harold, Mrs. Surratt, and kindred spirits at his beck

</p>
<p>dered her heart, her all to youi keeping, for the love that has blos-
</p>
<p>somed only for you, Wilkes "
</p>
<p>The appeal was not finished, for at that moment the door opened
</p>
<p>and a man appeared on the tlireshold.
</p>
<p>Booth saw him tlrst, and his eyes lighted uj) ^ itli a strange
</p>
<p>pleasure while he gazed.
</p>
<p>Stella turned slowly upon the visitor.
</p>
<p>" Merciful God !" arose from her lips, as she tottered back. "Oh,
</p>
<p>fiend Bend ! what brings you here?"
</p>
<p>The next moment, ere the sentence was entirely finished, the
</p>
<p>beautiful girl fell senseless at Booth's feet.
</p>
<p>The man in the doorway seemed transformed into a statue whose
</p>
<p>eyes were starting from its head.
</p>
<p>"Come in," said Booth to him. "This girl must have met you
</p>
<p>before, Payne."
</p>
<p>Payne?
</p>
<p>Tes ; the thug had come back.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI
</p>
<p>THE TERRIBLE MANTRAP.
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne slowly crossed the Step with his eyes fixed on the
</p>
<p>unconscious girl lying at Booth's feet.
</p>
<p>Was this the same person he hart tracked from the White House
</p>
<p>a few nights before to throttle ami throw him into the Po-
</p>
<p>lomac ?
</p>
<p>He could scarcely credit the evidence ot sight, and yet the face
</p>
<p>was the same.
</p>
<p>Yes; it was Stella, his lale vicli
</p>
<p>with his own blood-stained hands be

</p>
<p>No wonder that Payue stared at her as if he saw a person who

</p>
<p>had risen from thu dead ; no wonder that his eyes almost started
</p>
<p>from their sot^kets, und that, despite his hardened (character, an icy
</p>
<p>chill crept to his heart.
</p>
<p>Booth eould not but notice the mans sudden change of de-
</p>
<p>meanor.
</p>
<p>He already secretly rejoiced that Payne liad come back of his
</p>
<p>own accord.
</p>
<p>An hundred times had he longed for his right hand man since
</p>
<p>the quarrel, but he (Booth) was too proud to ask him to return.
</p>
<p>Payne did not pause until he stood over Stella.
</p>
<p>Then he slowly lifted his eyes to Booth, who saw that the mur-
</p>
<p>derer's face was white.
</p>
<p>When did she come?" he asked, with siarcfly a perceptible
</p>
<p>movement of his lips.
</p>
<p>" Awhile ago; but why did she faint on seeing you ?"
</p>
<p>" Hang me if I know," was the quick answer. " I know I'm not
</p>
<p>good looking, but I did not think I was hideous enough to frighten
</p>
<p>women into a faint." The speaker smiled grimly, and let his eyes
</p>
<p>wander to the girl again. " If she can be moved. I'd like to see you
</p>
<p>for a moment, Wilkes."
</p>
<p>Payne appeared to have something of importance to communi-
</p>
<p>cate, and Booth at once stooped and lifted Stella tenderly in his
</p>
<p>arms.
</p>
<p>Watched by Payne, the chief plotter carried the unconscious
</p>
<p>girl across the room and into the hallway beyond.
</p>
<p>" I have sent her home," he said.
</p>
<p>"Home?" echoed Payne, starting forward. "Where does she
</p>
<p>live?"
</p>
<p>"She would not tell me; she wants to be mysterious. I called a
</p>
<p>oab and told the driver to convey her to any place she desired to
</p>
<p>go."
</p>
<p>Payne showed hia disappointment by his looks.
</p>
<p>He wanted to know where Stella lived.
</p>
<p>What for ?
</p>
<p>To succeed the second time where lie had failed the first, no

<p>"I can't see him, but he's there all the same, lone," he said,

<p>CHAPTER XVII.
</p>
<p>THE EVE OF DOOM.
</p>
<p>Everything seemed iu readiness now for the consummation of
</p>
<p>the great plot.
</p>
<p>Silas Cantwell, Booths once friend, but persistent watcher, had
</p>
<p>been put out of the way, and Lewis Payne, who had sharpened his
</p>
<p>dirk for Secreiary Seward's heart, could assure the chief plotter
</p>
<p>that he need fear the war detective no longer.
</p>
<p>The war detective, with Paul, had determined to follow the trail
</p>
<p>to the end, without the assistance of any one.
</p>
<p>He felt himself able to cope with Booth and his associav<"s, but
</p>
<p>late events have demonstrated that he had failed to do so.

<p>On the night of the thirteenth of April, or the night following

<p>They were all there, and for the last time thedreadful crime was
</p>
<p>calmly discussed, and the final orders given by Booth.

<p>(.)u the table lay a map, dotted here and there with little red
</p>
<p>lints, under each of which was a name.
</p>
<p>T'l-sM were the houses of "friends" on the Maryland peninsula,
</p>
<p>and John Surratt had marked them all.
</p>
<p>Even the roads which Booth was to take after the assassination
</p>
<p>had been traced in red a color terribly appropriate for the
</p>
<p>crimson trail he afterward made from the nation's capitol.
</p>
<p>The conference broke up late, and the conspirators stole from
</p>
<p>the house, and departed their several ways.
</p>
<p>Booth's step that night was light, even elastic.
</p>
<p>He did not fear Silas Cantwell any longer, and he had even for-
</p>
<p>gotten Pauline, who, Payne said, would be kept within doors by
</p>
<p>Paul's illness.
</p>
<p>He had tried to win her love, but she had repulsed him.
</p>
<p>Unlike Stella, she had refused to fall in love with his handsome
</p>
<p>face and winning voice, although she had treated him in a friendly,
</p>
<p>respectful manner, until she began to discover that he had evil
</p>
<p>designs against a great man's life.
</p>
<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Booth, hailing in front of one of the promi-
</p>
<p>nent hotels on the avenue on his way home from the last conclave.
</p>
<p>"There is Brady, by my life! " and in he went, to slap a tall man
</p>
<p>on the shoulder, with a "Hello, old fellow!" which was immedi-
</p>
<p>ately returned with a friendly greeting.
</p>
<p>Brady was a colonel iu the Potomac army, and had but lately
</p>
<p>arrived from the front.
</p>
<p>"We'll all be there presently, Wilkes two hundred thousand of
</p>
<p>Us," said the Union ^^0 oi e.. " Your friends, my dear fellow, have
</p>
<p>reached their last ditch."
</p>
<p>Booth's irieudliness toward the South was so well known that
</p>
<p>his intimate :riends never hesitated to jest him about it.
</p>
<p>On this occasion, howerei the actor-assassin started, and while
</p>
<p>bis brow suddenly darkened for a moment, his eyes seemed to
</p>
<p>snap triumphantly.
</p>
<p>" All of them have not found it yet, colonel," he said. " It may

<p>He paused at last before the house on C street, meutioin-d by
</p>
<p>Payne na being Stella's abode.
</p>
<p>At eight o'clock he was seen again.
</p>
<p>This time he was looking into a private box on the stage ol
</p>
<p>Ford's.
</p>
<p>He was ready for the great crime.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.
</p>
<p>ASSASSINATED
</p>
<p>True it was that the blow was about to fall.
</p>
<p>It is not our intention to tell too minute particulars the story of
</p>
<p>that awful Friday night.
</p>
<p>History has recorded it on her darkest page, and it has been re-
</p>
<p>told throughout the land ten thousand times.
</p>
<p>The memory of that night lingers like some horrid nightmare in
</p>
<p>the iniuds of many who are living to-day.
</p>
<p>The awful report "The president has been assassinated!" still
</p>
<p>rings in the ears of thousands who heard it that ni
</p>
<p>first fair flushes of the following day.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth was to play his damnable drama to its close.
</p>
<p>He had rung the curtain up on the flrst scene ; death was to ring
</p>
<p>it down on the last one.
</p>
<p>We left Booth at the close of the last chapter standing among the
</p>
<p>wings of the stage attached to Ford's theater.
</p>
<p>He had selected a spot from whence he could look into the presi-
</p>
<p>dent's oox, which was adorned with flags because of the crowning
</p>
<p>triumph Grant had lately won.
</p>
<p>It was exptcted that Grant would attend the theater with the
</p>
<p>president; but the great commander had been called from the
</p>
<p>ity, much to the disappointment of the enthusiastic audience as-
</p>
<p>sembled to greet him.
</p>
<p>For several minutes Booth watched, as well as he was able, the oc-
</p>
<p>cupants of Lincoln's box, who were, besides the president himself,
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Harris, and Major Rathbone, of the provost-

<p>general's ofBce.
</p>
<p>After awhile Wilkes Booth disappeared, having been noticed by
</p>
<p>no one, and the curtain rose for the play, which was "Our
</p>
<p>American Cousin," with Miss Laura Keene in the most prominent
</p>
<p>role
</p>
<p>The house was packed from pit to dome by one of the most bril-
</p>
<p>liant audiences ever seen in Washington.
</p>
<p>Who, of all that vast assembly, dreamed that a tragedy was to
</p>
<p>be enacted instead of the advertised comedy?
</p>
<p>Not one.
</p>
<p>Those who could look into the president's box from their seats
</p>
<p>saw a smile flit now and then across the wan, careworn face of the
</p>
<p>ereat man.
</p>
<p>Well might he appear happy now.
</p>
<p>A mighty loud had been taken from his heart.
</p>
<p>He siood no longer amid the smoke of civil war.
</p>
<p>It had all rolled away, showing him the dawn of a peace which
</p>
<p>he hoped l)y moderation to make eternal.

<p>where Booth had left the fleet-footed mare during the atter-

<p>This raau was John Spuugler, one of the scene-shifters.

<p>Spangler. " And I'll have tlie whole North at my heels, too."
</p>
<p>Ho entered the thiater this time by the front door and from
</p>
<p>the dress circle surveyed the stage.
</p>
<p>The moment for the third act came.
</p>
<p>Booth had left his new station to whisper calmly in the stage

</p>
<p>The underling obeyed his master, and while he did so the tele-
</p>
<p>graph wires leading from the ciiy were severed, so that Booth
</p>
<p>might gallop lo safety with Lincoln's blood on hand and heart.
</p>
<p>'The door leading into the president's box was open.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Booth appeared at the threshold, and seemed about to

<p>enter.

<p>True, he was uot dead; but there was no hope.
</p>
<p>Booth's bullet had done its horrid work too well.
</p>
<p>Lincoln lay iu the little room across the street from the play-
</p>
<p>house, surrounded by his family, and a weeping cabinet.
</p>
<p>Slowly the life of the great man, the flrst martyr president, was

<p>ebbing away.
</p>
<p>His blood dyed the folds of the Hag which was floating that
</p>
<p>morning above the battered ramparts of rebellion.
</p>
<p>He was to die at the threshold of peace, at the open door of a

<p>new era, and all the prayers of the land were not enough to save

<p>him.
</p>
<p>Washington was all excitement.

<p>A thousand rumors of the wildest kind filled the air.

<p>Not long after Booth's attempt on the president's life it became
</p>
<p>known that a rufBan, armed with a dirk, had actually fought his

<p>way to Secretary Seward's bed, and stabbed him, so the assassin

<p>thought, to death.

<p>police wisely believed that they had fled.
</p>
<p>Morning was breaking, when a tall and handsome, but pale-
</p>
<p>faoed woman entered a room on tiptoe, and bent over a young
</p>
<p>man who was enjoying a deep sleep on a couch.
</p>
<p>"There were traces of suffering on the bloodless face, half buried
</p>
<p>amoug the pillow.^, :ind the woman's eyes filled with pity as she
</p>
<p>eazwi ui.on it.
</p>
<p>He was awake.
</p>
<p>"Ah! is it you, Pauline?" he said, with

</p>

<p>pleased smile.

<p>No. 1 c.aiuot thiuk what keeps him."

<p>Ue wumnu slopped suddenly and turned her face away,

<p>riiotioii seemed to be choking her.
</p>
<p>Pauline, something has happened," said the youth.
</p>
<p>How

<p>'Yoii
</p>
<p>know something some bad news. You are trying to keep it frc
</p>
<p>me. Tliis will never do. Tell me what it is?"
</p>
<p>Slowly Pauline turned to the cot again.
</p>
<p>Then she dropped into a chair beside the pillow and took Paul's
</p>
<p>hand.
</p>
<p>" Bud news it is," she murmured. "The president is dead ! "
</p>
<p>How the young man started.
</p>
<p>A strauge light appealed in his almost lusterless eyes.
</p>
<p>'Dead, Pauline? No, no!  not dead!" hesaid.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps uot (luite dead, but there is no hope."
</p>
<p>"Wlid did it?"
</p>
<p>"Wilkes Booth!"
</p>
<p>Pauline felt the hand she held glide from her grasp.
</p>
<p>"Silas has failed, then! He said he would not let Booth carry

<p>out his scheme. He My God ! where can Silas be? "

<p>Paul called the war detective Silas oftener than Leon, which

<p>THE WAR LIBRARY.
</p>
<p>Beyond lUn lutelligence that it was really Booth who had killed
</p>
<p>Llnooln, and that he had an accomplice named Harold, but littlt
</p>
<p>had been found out.  ^^, ^ ^ ^
</p>
<p>It wa3 known that a man answenng Booth s description had
</p>
<p>crossed the Uniontown bridge the night ot the murder; beyond
</p>
<p>that nothing.
</p>
<p>Men said that the assassin would bury himself among the swamps
</p>
<p>ol the Maryland peuiusula until the hunt slacked; then he would
</p>
<p>escape into the heart of the collapsed Confederacy, and from
</p>
<p>thence reach a hiding-place beyond the sen.
</p>
<p>I Let us return to Booth, for to follow him is to reach the end by
</p>
<p>a direct route; it is to tell what Silas Cantwell accomplished, and
</p>
<p>how the blood of the martyr president was avenged.
</p>
<p>We left him and Harold, his giddy young accomplice, ridin;;
</p>
<p>along the gloomy road that stretched southward from Surratts-
</p>
<p>Ha'rold did not venture to disturb Booth's reveries again.
</p>
<p>He saw that he had made a mistake in reminding Booth of Stellas
</p>
<p>devotion, aud the fierce look of the assassin had warned him not
</p>
<p>to repeat the indiscretion.
</p>
<p>It was near sunrise on Saturday when Booth and Harold drew
</p>
<p>rein before a house three miles from a hamlet, called Bryan-
</p>
<p>It was a doctor's residence, and a few moments after the halt, the
</p>
<p>country surgeon was cutting a boot from Booth's leg.
</p>
<p>The assassin with his hat pulled over his forehead bore the pain,
</p>
<p>occasioned by Dr. Mudd's operations, without a groan, and when
</p>
<p>the job was completed, handed him twenty-live dollars in green-
</p>
<p>The doctor, in addition to the fee, kept the mutilated boot, on
</p>
<p>the lining of which was the inscription :
</p>
<p>*'J Wilkes."
</p>
<p>This name was to help the assassin on to death.
</p>
<p>Aided no w by a pair of crutches, which an Englishman at Mudd's
</p>
<p>house had whittled out, while the broken leg was being dressed.
</p>
<p>Booth could hobble about the house.

</p>
<p>He and Harold kept close together all day.
</p>
<p>Booth had been introduced to the doctor under a name picked
</p>
<p>up for the occasion, although any man with a little more than
</p>
<p>average intelligence would have suspected at once that something
</p>
<p>was wrong.
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd it seems was too thick-headed to suspicion.
</p>
<p>" Come, David, we must move on," said Booth, toward evening.
</p>
<p>"Something tells me that the Northern beagles are on our track.
</p>
<p>We must get away from this place."
</p>
<p>So the men slipped their horses from Mudd s stables an<l rode
</p>
<p>Bouth again.
</p>
<p>Always south ! , , ^
</p>
<p>The hopes of the assassiu rested where the lost cause had flour-
</p>
<p>ished, despite four years of battle.
</p>
<p>A short distance below Bryautown lie a number of deep, dark
</p>
<p>swamps, reeking with slime and filled with reptiles.
</p>
<p>More than one poor fugitive slave has exchanged bondage for
</p>
<p>death in their gloomy depths, aud deep in the disgusting ooze
</p>
<p>found a nameless grave.
</p>
<p>It was toward the fens that Booth and Harold rode after leaving
</p>
<p>Mudd's house. ^ ,  ^x .- i
</p>
<p>Before starting Booth had consulted the map John burratt had
</p>
<p>made for him, and he was anxious to reach a certain house desig-
</p>
<p>nated by a red dot on the paper.
</p>
<p>The twain skirted the edge of one of the swamps just mentioned
</p>
<p>AH at once Booth drew rein and cocked Ill's revolver.
</p>
<p>" Hold on, darl" cried a darky, who heard the click of the lock.
</p>
<p>" It's only ole Swan, an' he's been doin' nothin' out ob de way."
</p>
<p>" Come up here ; we want you," said Booth, leaning forward.
</p>
<p>The negro advanced with fear and trembling.
</p>
<p>" Do you know where Allen's Fresh is ?"
</p>
<p>" Yes, sah."
</p>
<p>" Can you guide us to the place?"
</p>
<p>Ouided by the negro, who moved ahead, the assassin and his ac-
</p>
<p>complice went forward again.
</p>
<p>THE WA.R LIBBARY.
</p>
<p>The door closed on the burly figure of the Maryland rebel, and
</p>
<p>the a^assin looked at Harold much relieved.
</p>
<p>An hour passed away, hut Co.xe did not return.
</p>
<p>Of course the fugitives did not sleep.
</p>
<p>Booth sat on the edge of the bed with a cocked revolver in hia
</p>
<p>hand, and with every sense on the alert.
</p>
<p>He looked like a jungle tiger surrounded by his hunters, or like
</p>
<p>a wolf brought to bay.
</p>
<p>" Not a word was heard in that house until long after midnight
</p>
<p>All at once a slight noise drove the two men to their feet.
</p>
<p>" (iet ready, Dave," said the assassin. " No surrender ! Kill as
</p>
<p>many as you can belor you die."
</p>
<p>But the noise had not been made by the foot of a foe, but by
</p>
<p>Coxe himself.
</p>
<p>The man crept into the room.
</p>
<p>"By Jove! I've worked hard," he said, before Booth could
</p>
<p>question him. "I've been to the river, which is ten miles awav.
</p>
<p>There will be a boat ready for you at daylight. You can cross in
</p>
<p>safety. Beyond the Potomac you will find friends, of course. I
</p>
<p>will give you all the directions you need."
</p>
<p>"What about Cautwell? Hang the boat!" cried theimpatieut
</p>
<p>Booth. "Have you settled that human bloodhound?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, I couldn't find him," said Coxe, "so I went after the
</p>
<p>boat."
</p>
<p>Booth's jouutenance fell.
</p>
<p>" Must we Uy, then ?" he asked.
</p>
<p>" Indeed you must. Ton are not safe this side the j-iver."
</p>
<p>* We will go, then ; but the journey must be made before morn-
</p>
<p>ing."
</p>
<p>" Of course. You can't get to the river in the daytime. I'll get
</p>
<p>everything ready."
</p>
<p>Once more the fugitives were left alone in that gloomy room.
</p>
<p>Neither spoke a word.
</p>
<p>Did Booth believe that the hunt for him would soon draw to an

<p>end?
</p>
<p>If he did not think thus, why did he grate his teeth whenever he
</p>
<p>glanced at his swollen and bandaged leg ?
</p>
<p>Just before daylight, Coxe returned, and announced that every-
</p>
<p>thing was in reaSiness for the journey to the Potomac.
</p>
<p>Horses were found saddled at the rebel's door, and the three
</p>
<p>men mounted and rode away.
</p>
<p>More than once Wilkes Booth glanced over his shoulder, and
</p>
<p>tried to pierce the dark shadows they were leaving behind, as if
</p>
<p>from them he e.xpHcted to see the war detective emerge.
</p>
<p>Silas Cantwell dirt not show himself, however, and the men
</p>
<p>reached the river, wLei e they hid themselves until the boat should
</p>
<p>arrive.
</p>
<p>Coxe went to a certain plai-e along the bank, inspected it for a
</p>
<p>moment, uttered an oath of disappointment, and went bad'
</p>
<p>"No boat yet," he said.
</p>
<p>Booth bit his lip.
</p>
<p>No boat, and daylight was near at hand !
</p>
<p>Not until the mornmg of another day had dawned did the man
</p>
<p>who was to furnish the boat make his appearance.
</p>
<p>He tied the boat he brought by a stone anchor, and went away.
</p>
<p>"At last, thank fortune!" ejaculated Booth, when told that the
</p>
<p>craft was ready.  We will now put a river between us and the
</p>
<p>Yankee beagles."
</p>
<p>All three crept down to the water, and Booth and Harold en-
</p>
<p>tered the boat.
</p>
<p>They bade Coxe good-by, and Harold's arms sent the craft spin-
</p>
<p>nine toward the middle of the Pwtomac.
</p>
<p>"We're going to outwit them!" exclaimed Booth, in good
</p>
<p>spirits. "The heart of the Confederacy will soon harbor us, boy,
</p>
<p>and the hero's laurels will be ours."
</p>
<p>Harold smiled, faintly, and bent himself to the work before him.
</p>
<p>The boat rapidly approached the opposite shore, and when
</p>
<p>Booth stood on dry ground again, a cry ol exultation broke from
</p>
<p>his lips.

<p>THE WAR LIBRARY.
</p>
<p>" Is Silae Cautwell out there ?" he asked.
</p>
<p>The war detective answered for himself.
</p>
<p>" I am here."
</p>
<p>As Booth went back to his old post an oath fell from his lips.
</p>
<p>" We've waited long enough on you, Booth," said Baker. "If
</p>
<p>you don't surrender, we'll Are the barnl"
</p>
<p>" Withdraw your forces one hundred yards from the barn and I
</p>
<p>will come," was the reply. " Give me a chance, captain. I will
</p>
<p>never be taken alive. I am ready to die. Get ready a stretcher
</p>
<p>forme."
</p>
<p>A hand fell on Booth's arm as he tluished.
</p>
<p>"There are no hopes, Wilkes "
</p>
<p>"Silence!" thuudered Booth. "You are a coward, Harold.
</p>
<p>Payne said you would shrink at the last hour. Get away from
</p>
<p>here. I'll die without you. Go!"
</p>
<p>Then Booth shouted to the men outside.
</p>
<p>" Here's a coward who wants to surrender. Let him out."
</p>
<p>Harold had already glided to the door, and was waiting to be
</p>
<p>taken prisoner.
</p>
<p>He was soon gratified in this desire, and Booth was now the sole
</p>
<p>occunaut of the barn.
</p>
<p>Colonel Conger now took the candle and touched its name to
</p>
<p>some straw which he drew from a crack.
</p>
<p>The nt'xt moment the flre shot toward the roof, and a curse
</p>
<p>came from the man inside !
</p>
<p>It was a fearful scene.
</p>
<p>Higher and higher leaped the angry flames, as it eager to en-
</p>
<p>velop the assassin^s last retreat in speedy ruin.
</p>
<p>The soldiers and all outside looked wonderingly on.
</p>
<p>They saw the interior of the barn, as the flre made progress;
</p>
<p>they also saw Booth drawn to his full stature, calmly awaiting his
</p>
<p>merited doom.
</p>
<p>Silas Cantwell moved forward and put his eye to a crack.

</p>
<p>That instant. Booth caught sight of his persistent foe.
</p>
<p>" You 11 go before me, Silas!" he hissed, creeping forward, his
</p>
<p>eyes on tire, and fixed on the detective's face.
</p>
<p>He had exchanged his levolver for the carbine whicli HmuM
</p>
<p>had carri'-d from Lloyd's hotel, at Surrattsville, and his finger was
</p>
<p>at the easy trigger.
</p>
<p>Did Cuiitwell see him 1
</p>
<p>Ko ; tht' tire raging around Booth obstructed his v
</p>
<p>He would send another soul ahead of him into eternity, and
</p>
<p>that soul sliduld be t'.int well's.
</p>
<p>He saw only Silas, not the dark faced, Puritan-like soldier who
</p>
<p>was covering liim with a carbine.
</p>
<p>"Now, Silas, for hell ahead of me!" he cried.
</p>
<p>The next instant a loud report rose above the crackling flames,
</p>
<p>and the inaguidceiit figure of Wilkes Booth, toppling forward, fell
</p>
<p>heavilv to the floor!
</p>
<p>B.iston Corbett's bullet win in his brain!
</p>
<p>A loud shout followed the shot, the barn door was jerked open,
</p>
<p>ai' ' th. hreathi.ig carcass of the assassin dragged forth.
</p>
<p>They laid him on the grass in the glare of the burning barn, and
</p>
<p>gave him water.
</p>
<p>After awhile the soldiers carried him to the old farm-house, and
</p>
<p>lid him on the porch.
</p>
<p>There the whole ci'owd gathered around him.
</p>
<p>For awhile the assassin's eyes wandered wildly, then they be-
</p>
<p>came tlxed on one man the war detective.
</p>
<p>Silas Cautwell approached and bent over the murderer.
</p>
<p>Booth tried to speak ; he wauted to say something about Cant-
</p>
<p>well's persistent hunt, but he had not the power.
</p>
<p>Suddeulv his fiead fell back, the death gurgle sounded in his
</p>
<p>throat, and with his eyes fixed triumphantly on Cantwell, he mut-
</p>
<p>tered :

<p>" Useless useless," and died !
</p>
<p>Yes, useless had been his life, and the shot he had fired to avenge
</p>
<p>the Confederacy had killed more than one.
