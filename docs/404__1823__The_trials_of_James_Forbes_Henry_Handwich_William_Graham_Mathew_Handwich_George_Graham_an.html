</p>
<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The proceedings detailed in the following pages, are preg-
</p>
<p>nant with interest  -they disclose facts and circumstances, that
</p>
<p>claim the earnest and undivided attention, of every reflecting
</p>
<p>individual in the community  the entire of the transactions,
</p>
<p>including the original charge, with the subsequent prosecu-
</p>
<p>fjion, and its unsatisfactory termination, are of a character to
</p>
<p>influence, not merely the present temper, but possibly the ul-
</p>
<p>terior destinies of the country. Many attempts have been
</p>
<p>made to represent the matters alluded to, as frivolous, and
</p>
<p>trivial, but those who have attended more minutely to the
</p>
<p>workings of the public mind, and to the general progress of
</p>
<p>events, are inclined to form a very different conclusion 
</p>
<p>these trials, with their singular result, are at least indicative
</p>
<p>of the character, and probably decisive of the fate of an as-
</p>
<p>sociation, which has hitherto contrived to render itself, alike
</p>
<p>formidable to the Government, and the People  they have
</p>
<p>f ully developed the principles of those selfish miscreants, who
</p>
<p>have gone forward for years, trampling on the hopes, and blasts
</p>
<p>ing the prospects of the country, possessing themselves of in-
</p>
<p>fluence, but to produce calamity ! and availing themselves of
</p>
<p>confidence, only to generate confusion, and distrust.
</p>
<p>The present publication comes not before the reading
</p>
<p>world as a mere pamphlet  it is a work for historical refer-
</p>
<p>ence  interesting to cotemporaries, and likely to be valuable
</p>
<p>in centuries hence  to the future writer, who shall trace the
</p>
<p>History of our ill-fated Country, it will afford ample, but
</p>
<p>melancholy, materials for observation and reflection it will
</p>
<p>enable him to solve many of those political enigmas, which
</p>
<p>have bewildered the theorists, of the times that are past  it
</p>
<p>will aid him in vindicating the long injured population of Ire-
</p>
<p>land, from the frequently reiterated charge of restlessness and
</p>
<p>. disaffection  it will assist him in elucidating the mysterious,
</p>
<p>irregularities of the national character -in explaining apparent

<p>inconsistencies, and in illustrating circumstances that have been
</p>
<p>occasionally looked on as contradictory and inexplicable.
</p>
<p>The transactions recorded in the following sheets, will open
</p>
<p>to England! and to Europe, the true character of our internal
</p>
<p>policy  they will shew the real cause of our occasional dis-

<p>nisei, "will easily trace to the true source, many of the evils
</p>
<p>-which have hitherto afflicted the Country, the wrongs of the
</p>
<p>People will be thoroughly manifested, and the misfortunes
</p>
<p>accruing from the ascendancy of a desperate and selfish
</p>
<p>faction, made even self-evident  it will be seen, that if the
</p>
<p>lower classes have been turbulent and dissatisfied, it was not
</p>
<p>without ample provocation  if they sometimes resorted to
</p>
<p>direct and vindictive retaliation, it was from a justifiable
</p>
<p>feeling of distrust in the efficiency of the laws  if they re-
</p>
<p>venged themselves, when chance gave them the power, in a
</p>
<p>harsh or illegal mode, it was from a well founded conviction
</p>
<p>of the impossibility of procuring satisfaction, in any other
</p>
<p>shape : they had prejudiced tribunals to appeal to, and from
</p>
<p>such they naturally despaired of obtaining an impartial de-
</p>
<p>cision ; the conclusion of the Trials is sufficient to justify this
</p>
<p>distrust on the part of the People. If the Viceroy cannot
</p>
<p>procure redress for an open assault and outrage, what has
</p>
<p>the peasant to hope for ?  an Orange Juror, with a host of
</p>
<p>witnesses before him, will not criminate a guilty brother, even
</p>
<p>for an attempt on the person of the first character in the coun-
</p>
<p>try ; and with this fact before us can we suppose him likely to
</p>
<p>act with impartiality, where only the life or interest of a mere
</p>
<p>commoner is at stake  party feeling is the curse  the besetting
</p>
<p>sin  -the hereditary blemish of our soil  the poverty and the
</p>
<p>distresses of our country, have only increased the virulence of
</p>
<p>political animosity  faction has produced faction  and the in-
</p>
<p>signia, and the watch- word of one association of idiots have
</p>
<p>been answered by the emblems and expressions of another 
</p>
<p>this state of things must terminate  the system of Ribbonism
</p>
<p>has been disarranged and broken; and the disciples of Orange-
</p>
<p>isnj should be prepared for a similar catastrophe the rulers of
</p>
<p>the country have no alternative  their authority in order to
</p>
<p>continue must be exerted  if they seek the attachment or de-
</p>
<p>mand the obedience of the people, they must seem anxious to

<p>deserve the one, and appear competent to enforce the other 
</p>
<p>with us the Viceroy is the depositary of their power, and ke if
</p>
<p>not checked or shackled by cabinet intrigue, is capable of mak-
</p>
<p>ing that power, both dreaded and respected.
</p>
<p>The attention of- the reader is particularly directed to the
</p>
<p>.opening Speech of the Attorney- Gen era! this eloquent and
</p>
<p>impassioned appeal, of which an ample Report is here given, ...
</p>
<p>is worthy of the high character of our distinguished countrv-
</p>
<p>man  Mr. North's harangue has been admired  'tis certainly
</p>
<p>smooth and shewy, but the texture is extremely slight  the
</p>
<p>gentleman is a fair declaimer, but in reality,, a most wretched
</p>
<p>reasoner  the Solicitor-General's statement, will be found in-
</p>
<p>teresting  and, it is sufficient to mention the name of Bushe,
</p>
<p>to procure an attentive perusal, for the admirable Charge to

<p>STATE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>COURT OF KINGS BENCH.
</p>
<p>MONDAY, FEB. S, 1823.
</p>
<p>The King, at the Prosecution of the Right Hon. William
</p>
<p>Conyngham Plunkett, Attorney General,
</p>
<p>versus
</p>
<p>Mathero Handwich, Henry Handwich, George Graham* fTm,-
</p>
<p>Graham, William Brownlow, and James Forbes.
</p>
<p>AT an early hour in the morning, so early as half-past six
</p>
<p>o'clock, the doors of the Court were surrounded by a consider-*
</p>
<p>able number of persons ; towards nine the crowd greatly en-
</p>
<p>creased, and among them a large number of Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Bar. When the doors were opened the rush was frightful ;
</p>
<p>some gentlemen were thrown down and severely hurt; many
</p>
<p>had their clothes torn, and lost their hats and shoes ; the scene
</p>
<p>was dreadful to those who were compelled to be participators
</p>
<p>in it disgraceful to those whose duty it was to have prevented
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>The Judges entered the Court at ten o'clock. The Clerk
</p>
<p>having read the indictments, and called the names of the Tra-
</p>
<p>versers severally, they made no answer to the call. The High
</p>
<p>Sheriffs were ordered to be called by Mr. Hyland, officer of the
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>At half-past twelve the Attorney-General rose; he said, that,
</p>
<p>until the Traversers had severally answered to their names, ho
</p>
<p>would make no observation.
</p>
<p>The Court was now crowded beyond any thing ever before
</p>
<p>witnessed in a Court of Justice  the windows were elevated to
</p>
<p>admit air.
</p>
<p>The Traversers were again called by the Crier, severally ;
</p>
<p>and after proclamation for the Jury to be impanelled, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General required to know if the Special Jurors had
</p>
<p>been all summoned ; and if s<^ was the Sheriff ready to prove
</p>
<p>the fact  the answer was in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>Mr. Seriven.  ihe Crown cannot proceed until the whole

</p>
<p>panel be "-one through, and until it be signed. He argued for
</p>
<p>the Traversers the right to have the panel signed by th &ieriff;
</p>
<p>B
</p>
<p>and put it to the Court, whether the panel could be gone through
</p>
<p>if it were encreased without end.  How do we know it to ba
</p>
<p>the return to the precept ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Blackburne.  We apprehend this is not the proper
</p>
<p>panel ; it must be authenticated. The Court cannot act upon
</p>
<p>the panel without legal evidence, or official authentication. I
</p>
<p>have no objection, however, to the calling of the panel before
</p>
<p>it be signed.
</p>
<p>The panel was then called.
</p>
<p>There were repeated interruptions, from noise and confusion
</p>
<p>in the Court. The Jury not answering, the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>said it was necessary that the whole panel should be called on
</p>
<p>fine.
</p>
<p>The Traverser's Counsel objected to the fine imposed for
</p>
<p>non-appearance, as being excessive  20l.
</p>
<p>The Att. Gen. declared his intention to enforce every fine.
</p>
<p>P. Golding, called and sworn.  Did >'you summon John
</p>
<p>Chambers ? I left the summons at his residence in Dublin.
</p>
<p>Forty-seven of the panel only having appeared.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Considering the importance to public
</p>
<p>justice of the trial, I must request that the Court will commit
</p>
<p>for contumacy.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  It Is the unanimous opinion of the Court,
</p>
<p>that it cannot at present take any ulterior step : but Mr. Attorney-
</p>
<p>General may move to enlarge the panel.
</p>
<p>Mr. Attorney- General consented, and the Sheriff was di-
</p>
<p>rected to proceed accordingly.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General.-  Every one in this Court must be sur-
</p>
<p>prised at the smallness of the panel. I have a right to examine
</p>
<p>the Officers of the Court touching the cause.
</p>
<p>Ten names were then added to the panel.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll required the Sheriffs' signatures to it  granted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll required one of the two informations to be tried
</p>
<p>at a time.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General dissented.

</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll contended for his privilege ; the informations
</p>
<p>were dissimilar, and should be tried separately.
</p>
<p>Mr. North made an objection for the prisoners, which was
</p>
<p>overruled.
</p>
<p>The Traversers, James Forbes, William Graham, William
</p>
<p>Brownlow, Henry Handwich, George Graham, and Mathew
</p>
<p>Handwich, were then put to the bar, and the panel was again
</p>
<p>called over, upon a fine of fifty pounds, in order to swear in
</p>
<p>a Jury.
</p>
<p>W. S. Magee, challenged by the Crown.
</p>
<p>pram-is Mills, sworn.
</p>
<p>George Alker, challenged. This person having taken the hc&k in his banc!.
</p>
<p>Mr. Perrin objected to the challenge, as the oath had begun*
</p>
<p>to be administered. It has been so ruled in the case of the
</p>
<p>King versus Brandeth.
</p>
<p>Attorney Gsner.il  The Officer of the Court will state the
</p>
<p>practice, and whether he went as far as the words " well and
</p>
<p>truly try."
</p>
<p>Mr. Serjeant Lefroy  It is a rule of practice, not of law.
</p>
<p>The whole oath Avas not administered.

</p>
<p>Mr. Johnston  I wish to ask whether the Juror has said

</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll for the prisoners.  My Lords, before the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General commences his statement, or enters into evidence
</p>
<p>for the prosecution, I have to pray your Lordships, that as the
</p>
<p>informations in this case are dissimilar, different judgments may
</p>
<p>be given.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.-^-In felony and stealing the informations are
</p>
<p>dissimilar, and yet the same judgment is given. How can you
</p>
<p>make such an application in this case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Johnson  My Lords, we demand a precedent
</p>
<p>from the other side; a case in which it has been done 'in invittint.*
</p>
<p>v Mr. J. S. Townsend, (for the Crown)  There is no precedent
</p>
<p>for diversity of judgment, excepting in what is called villaincous
</p>
<p>judgment, and that is only in capital cases.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Precisely so; therefore the Court cannot
</p>
<p>grant the application for which the Traversers counsel have
</p>
<p>contended.
</p>
<p>Mr. North rose to support the application of Mr. Driscoll.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I could wish, Mr. North, that you had
</p>
<p>risen before the Court had decided the point. I am most un-
</p>
<p>willing to deprive the Traversers of the assistance of their
</p>
<p>counsel, and on this account I shall attend to any observations
</p>
<p>that you may offer.
</p>
<p>Mr. North  -I thank Fyour Lordship, and I beg to ask, my
</p>
<p>Lord, if one of the prisoners be found guilty on one count,
</p>
<p>and some another, and supposing them anxious to make an
</p>
<p>application for a new trial, in which they must all concur, how
</p>
<p>is it possible unless there be a dissimilarity of judgment and
</p>
<p>evidence, for your Lordships to say, whether the Traversers
</p>
<p>are entitled to such a right, either collectively or individually.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  ? We do not consider this a valid objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll then applied to the Attorney -General for a list
</p>
<p>of the witnesses for the crown? In making the application, he
</p>
<p>was willing to grant to the Attorney-General a privilege of the
</p>
<p>same extent which he required for himself.

</p>
<p>The Attorney-General did not feel disposed to comply with
</p>
<p>the application of Mr. Driscoll.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll further required that the witnesses for the crown
</p>
<p>should be removed from Court,
</p>
<p>The Attorney General was willing to agree ; and he begged
</p>
<p>to state, that any concession which he could with propriety
</p>
<p>grant should be made to the counsel for the Traversers. But
</p>
<p>Tie begged to state, that none of the witnesses for the Crown
</p>
<p>were in court, at least, he could positively declare, that he had
</p>
<p>given orders that they should not be allowed to [be present. At
</p>
<p>the same time he said, he had no objection that any of the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the Traversers should remain in court.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  That being the case, I shall have the regula-
</p>
<p>tion of the whole business between the parties concerned.
</p>
<p>Mr. Richard W. Greene now opened the pleadings. The
</p>
<p>declaration contained many counts, and there were besides two
</p>
<p>informations  one with three, the other with two counts.
</p>
<p>First count stated that on the 14th December, in the 3d year
</p>
<p>of the King, that they repaired to the Theatre for the purpose
</p>
<p>of insulting his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
</p>
<p>Second count, for conspiring generally to create a riot in the
</p>
<p>Theatre.
</p>
<p>Third count, for having conspired to assault the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant.
</p>
<p>The second information. First count, after preliminary
</p>
<p>averments, that Defendants, with others unknown, did publicly
</p>
<p>insult, groan, and hiss his Excellency, kc.
</p>
<p>Second count, that die said Traversers did so continue to act
</p>
<p>for one hour and upwards.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General rose at half past twelve o'clock,
</p>
<p>and spoke as follows : 
</p>
<p>" My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury  It becomes my
</p>
<p>duty to state the grounds of the present prosecution, with
</p>
<p>the evidence on which it is to rest for support. My Lords 
</p>
<p>often as it has been my lot to have been a public prosecutor ;
</p>
<p>often as I have appeared to fulfil my duty to the Executive ;
</p>
<p>frequently as I have been engaged for private individuals, I do
</p>
<p>most solemnly declare, that I never approached this venerable
</p>
<p>Court with a more deep-felt anxiety, or addressed a -Jury un-
</p>
<p>der such embarrassing circumstances. My Lords, this is no
</p>
<p>ordinary case, nor is it a common-place occasion ; It is a case,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, in which although the lives of the parties are not
</p>
<p>concerned, nevertheless, if the facts charged be proved, it is
</p>
<p>a case in which heavy and exemplary punishment awaits the
</p>
<p>Defendants. It is a case, my Lords, as my learned friend
</p>
<p>who opened the pleadings has told you, in which it will be
</p>
<p>proved that a deliberate, preconcerted effort was made to
</p>
<p>assault the Representative of Majesty, and further, to drive
</p>
<p>him out of this country. Gentlemen, I cannot smooth or

</p>
<p>soften down facts: this is really the true complexion of the
</p>
<p>case at present before you. Gentlemen, I should indeed
</p>
<p>blush for the place of my birth, if I did not live in a country in
</p>
<p>which the mere mention of the facts which I shall disclose did
</p>
<p>not excite your indignation and abhorrence. I do not come
</p>
<p>here as the representative of Lord Wellesley. I do not come
</p>
<p>here to seek reparation for the injury and the outrage that ha
</p>
<p>been inflicted on that Nobleman ; but I come here, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, as the representative of the majesty of the law, to de-
</p>
<p>mand justice on a desperate, though contemptible gang, who
</p>
<p>have confederated to put down the King's Representative,
</p>
<p>roerelv because he obeys the King's eommandi.
</p>
<p>" My Lords, I know the feelings of the illustrious and ex-
</p>
<p>alted personage against whom this villainy has been committed
</p>
<p> I know that his elevated mind spurns at not having been
</p>
<p>exposed to any noble danger ; but as there is '* some sort of
</p>
<p>good in things evil," so has his Excellency's mind been
</p>
<p>cheered by that great and glorious burst of public feeling,
</p>
<p>which, in its mighty circumference of circle, lias surrounded
</p>
<p>the object of its admiration, and concealed from his admiring
</p>
<p>view, the dark spots that environ (he hallowed halo. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, it now remains for me to put down by law the atrocious
</p>
<p>gang whose hearts were so sublime, (and thanks be to Hea-
</p>
<p>ven, so solitary) in iniquity, as to conceive and perpetrate an
</p>
<p>object of such atrocious ferocity. Gentlemen, on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion I have no object no feeling but one  namely, the attain-
</p>
<p>ment of public justice ; and believe me when I say that I
</p>
<p>shall go away humbled and self-reproached from this Court,
</p>
<p>if 1 do not satisfactorily demonstrate, that a foul conspiracy
</p>
<p>existed against the person and the Government of the Marquis
</p>
<p>Wellesley, Gentlemen, the facts which I shall lay before you
</p>
<p>are in my mind so clear and palpable, that I protest to Hea-
</p>
<p>ven I should think I had committed a base dereliction of my
</p>
<p>official duty, had I not arraigned these men here to-day,
</p>
<p>before God, their King, and their Couatry. You are all aware,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, of the Grand Jury, I will not be so uncandid as
</p>
<p>to conceal from you my strong conviction, that pubiic justice
</p>
<p>had not been done on that occasion. In all my experience of
</p>
<p>the troubles and political agitations of the last five and twenty
</p>
<p>years, I do most solemnly asseverate that I never heard  that
</p>
<p>I never met with a case in which the fact6 were so conclusive.,
</p>
<p>I wish to be understood as throwing no imputation on the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury  the affair is between God and their conscience.
</p>
<p>It is not my business to arraign the Sheriff who impannelled
</p>
<p>that Jury  he is not on his trial. It is not my business to
</p>
<p>denounce the Grand Jur}-  they too are not on their trial
</p>
<p>but the time may come, and at no very distant day, when, in

</p>
<p>another place, 1 shall not shrink from the efficient discharge
</p>
<p>of my public duty, should there be a further recurrence to
</p>
<p>this transaction. I entreat the indulgence of the Court, for.
</p>
<p>having so far criven way to my feelings. I implore the atten-
</p>
<p>tion of the Jury while I return to the case before them, and
</p>
<p>detail the dark and dangerous ramifications into which it
</p>
<p>branches and extends.
</p>
<p> Gentlemen  I shall commence so far back as the 4th of
</p>
<p>November, the anniversary of the birth-day of King William.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, perhaps it is no part of ray duty to rescue history
</p>
<p>from misrepresentation, or to defend the memory of the illus-
</p>
<p>trious dead ; but as one anxious to preserve the memory of
</p>
<p>King William from the contaminating influence of the igno-
</p>
<p>rant admiration of the traversers, in vindication of "the me-
</p>
<p>mory of a good man and a great King, T raise my voice
</p>
<p>against the ludicrious idolatry, against the millinery and
</p>
<p>mantua-making devotion of these hebroclite politicians. I
</p>
<p>claim for King William the merit of rescuing my country
</p>
<p>from the bondage and the despotism which the Stuarts inhe-
</p>
<p>rited from each other, and which flowed from father to son,
</p>
<p>generation after generation. I claim for him the merit of
</p>
<p>having subdued arbitrary power, of having conquered faction,
</p>
<p>of having transmitted to me, and to you, the blessings of a
</p>
<p>free Constitution. I claim for him the merit of the Bill of
</p>
<p>Rights, and the pure administration of justice. I claim for
</p>
<p>him the advantage of having prevented civil war, and of hav-
</p>
<p>ing settled the Constitution by stopping the effusion of blood.
</p>
<p> I claim to have him considered as a head to whom difficulty
</p>
<p>was but incitement, to whom impediment was but renewed
</p>
<p>exertion, to whom defeat was victory. I claim all this for
</p>
<p>the man who poor in purse, but rich in mind ; unaided, un-
</p>
<p>supported, excepting by exertion and perseverance, overcame
</p>
<p>the obstacles which a confliction of powerful interests flung in
</p>
<p>his way. Who by his wisdom, his firmness, his policy, united
</p>
<p>the most discordant and disagreeing materials, and reconciled
</p>
<p>the jarring pretensions of the jealous and the ambitious 
</p>
<p>Great King William was not a consummate general. Success
</p>
<p>xlid not crown his labours, nor the prospect of booty excite
</p>
<p>his ardor. But the want of both were unable to damp the
</p>
<p>vision of his mind. Adversa rerum immersabilis unda. That
</p>
<p>reward which in conquering a kingdom gave it a constitution
</p>
<p>similar in kind and equal in advantage to that enjoyed by the
</p>
<p>freest nation in the universe. He was a second Scipio ; su-
</p>
<p>perior to Tamerlane, and equal to Regulus, he wielded with
</p>
<p>discretion the unrestrained resources of a mixed monarchy.
</p>
<p>** Unfortunately, however, there were in this kingdom per-
</p>
<p>sons who, from a concordance in religion with the desposed
</p>
<p>monarch were ready to resist the government of William.

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I cannot but odmire the fidelity and devotion of
</p>
<p>these persons, and while I lament that the object of their
</p>
<p>affections was unworthy, I cannot but remember the strength
</p>
<p>of nature, the despotism of prejudice, and the endearing
</p>
<p>fascination of a similarity of sentiment. To these persons the
</p>
<p>victory of William was a u sad servitude," a bitter triumph.
</p>
<p>Their religion extinguished, their altars desecrated, their
</p>
<p>lands confiscated, their alliance broken with that monarch,
</p>
<p>whose fame, whose renown, whose strength, and whose glory,
</p>
<p>had made all Europe prostrate; and whose popularity promised
</p>
<p>a speedy acquisition of these kingdoms had it not been for the
</p>
<p>consummate wisdom and wise policy of the enlightenedWilliam
</p>
<p>I mean Louii IV.Long did this wound fester, and longer
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>did it fasten itself in these devoted, high minded, chiva-lris
</p>
<p>champions of a religion which they adored, and a principle
</p>
<p>which they cherished. But even this, this triumph was not
</p>
<p>sufficient by an intolerant party ; still did it ring in the ears
</p>
<p>of the subdued, the memory of their defeat and humiliation.
</p>
<p>Let me ask was this just ? I am sure it was not generous, nor
</p>
<p>high minded. And so, the beloved monarch who now reigns
</p>
<p>in the hearts, and rules, by the affections of his, people thought.
</p>
<p>In that visit, which in his solicitude for your welfare, he was
</p>
<p>induced to pay you, the memory of which shall never fade from
</p>
<p>my recollection, as I am sure it never will be obliterated from
</p>
<p>yours ; and any attempt to convey an idea of the blessings of
</p>
<p>which, would be vain, and inadequate in that visit his Ma~
</p>
<p>jesty witnessed with delight the ardour, the affection, and
</p>
<p>allegiance of his Irish subjects  his heart was touched  his
</p>
<p>generous nature was arroused  and he determined on the ex-
</p>
<p>tinction of those feuds and animosities, which had hitherto
</p>
<p>proved so baneful to the country. In this spirit his Majesty's
</p>
<p>parting admonition was framed. For a time it had the desired
</p>
<p>effect ; but even before his Majesty left this hospitable shore,
</p>
<p>it was evident that the elements of discord were at work. It
</p>
<p>is well known that before his Majesty condescended to dine at
</p>
<p>the Mansion- House, he had stipulated that the toast of the
</p>
<p>" Glorious Memory' should not be given. His Majesty, with
</p>
<p>that quick apprehension which he possesses, saw the evils of in-
</p>
<p>tolerance and animosity, and entered upon the godlike task of
</p>
<p>doing what had been left undone by his predecessors. In fur-
</p>
<p>therance of this object he participated in the conviviality of
</p>
<p>his subjects, and restrained by his august presence the intem-
</p>
<p>perate exhibition of an enthusiastic, (perhaps) but certainly a
</p>
<p>wicked and mistaken feeling. But this was not all  he sent
</p>
<p>among us a countryman of whom we are all proud, and who
</p>
<p>has added new lustre to the name of Irishmen; whose name
</p>
<p>and whose fame have spread wherever commerce or civilization

</p>
<p>has penetrated ; the brother of a warrior, a statesman himself,
</p>
<p>wise in council, deliberate in judgment, intrepid, unyielding,
</p>
<p>and resolute: prompt to command, ard ready to execute; the
</p>
<p>friend of civil and religious liberty  a soldier and a statesman.
</p>
<p>This is not adulation, or the inordinate incense which power
</p>
<p>commands. It is true, I am Attorney- General, and that
</p>
<p>Lord Wellesley is Chief Governor, but I have too correct a
</p>
<p>notion of that illustrious person's good taste to suppose he
</p>
<p>would not discountenance the familiarity of a sycv>pnantic
</p>
<p>flattery. However such was the man chosen to effectuate the
</p>
<p>intentions of royalty, and to put into practice the beautiful
</p>
<p>theory eked and etched out by the royal hand. The first act
</p>
<p>of the Marquis Wellesley was to discountenance the giving of
</p>
<p>a toast which was grossly misused and much misunderstood,
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>tfnd which in consequence was grossly offensive to the majority
</p>
<p>of the people. His second, to prevent that annual exhibition
</p>
<p>of bad ta^te and ' gaudy glare' by which the admiration of
</p>
<p>the vulgar were captivated and entralled. I speak of the
</p>
<p>dressing of the Statue merely as a matter of taste, and I
</p>
<p>assert that every educated and classic mind, must revolt at
</p>
<p>the idea of witnessing a hero and a conquerer crowned with
</p>
<p>chequered compliments of a dark red and deep yellow. I
</p>
<p>assert that no man has a right to dress the statue, or in any
</p>
<p>way to interfere with what is the public property. I remember
</p>
<p>same years ago, when some ruffians bedaubed that statue with
</p>
<p>lamp black, which by every one was considered an illegal
</p>
<p>disfiguration. 1 would ask, where is the mighty dLTerence
</p>
<p>between black and yellow ? Is not the one as illegal and as
</p>
<p>tasteless as the other ? The prohibition of this mischievous
</p>
<p>ceremony was called for by the Protestant, inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>neighbourhood ; no Roman Catholic signatures were afiixepl
</p>
<p>to the requiskion, although they had equally, nay doubly, a
</p>
<p>right to complain. On this requisition did the authorities act,
</p>
<p>sanctioned by the approving acquiescence of the _ Marquis VVel-
</p>
<p>lesley, and the consequence was, there was no dressing. 
</p>
<p>Then was the tocsin of alarm sounded against the ?>iarquis's
</p>
<p>government ; and then was planned that systematic opposition,
</p>
<p>that combined confederation, which has since enceavoured,
</p>
<p>covertly and openly, to subvert, impede, and overturn, the
</p>
<p>government of the Marquis Wellesley. For several nights
</p>
<p>was the statue guarded to prevent a breach of the peace, and
</p>
<p>twice was the dressing attempted in defiance law ; in defiance
</p>
<p>of the wishes of the King ; in defiance of the mandate of the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant. One of the Traversers at present arraigned
</p>
<p>it will be proved to you, was active at that dressing* The
</p>
<p>plotting went on in regular progression, from the 4-th of No-
</p>
<p>vember till the 7th of December, and on this day, the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators were aware that an opportunity would soon offer, to

</p>
<p>effect in public, what they had planned and designed in private.
</p>
<p>It was now advertised that his Excellency would visit the
</p>
<p>Theatre in state, on the 14th December, and thus would be
</p>
<p>afforded an excellent opportunity of pouring forth the muddy
</p>
<p>stream of their abominable animosity. Tickets were purchased
</p>
<p>from the Box-keeper, previously to the night of entertainment.
</p>
<p> a part of the gang were to station themselves in the pit-
</p>
<p>tome in the lattices  but the greater portion were to be civided
</p>
<p>between the upper and middle galleries. These latter were to
</p>
<p>march from Daly's in Werbutrgh-.street, that is. Lodge 1612.
</p>
<p>They were to go on ticket* previously purchased bv thr'ee of
</p>
<p>the Traversers. A man of the name of Heron, holdftig a
</p>
<p>respectable situation under (t )vernment in the Custom H;.mse
</p>
<p>and the Post-OJfice, was  to have furnished z.*for t lese uur*
</p>
<p>C
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>poses. Moreover, it will be stated that these people went
</p>
<p>armed with bludgeons; others had rattles and whistles; a third
</p>
<p>party were provided with inflammatory placards and addresses,
</p>
<p>which were flung copiously; some of these handbills Fell on
</p>
<p>bis Excellency's head. Others of the conspirators hallooed,
</p>
<p>vociferated, and hissed, on the exhibition of the signs, and on
</p>
<p>the shouting of the watchword by their confederates in the pit
</p>
<p>and lettices. Thus a regular subinfeudation and fealty will be
</p>
<p>proved, and this is the link by which the conspirators were
</p>
<p>bound and knit together, to overbear the law and brow-beat
</p>
<p>the authorities. All this will be proved to you by testimony
</p>
<p>unimpeachable and incorrupt. Moreover it will appear tliat
</p>
<p>a piece of wood, a watchman's rattle was flung, which struck
</p>
<p>his Excellency's box, and rebounded on the stage  that a
</p>
<p>glass bottle was hurled from the galleries by one of the Traver-
</p>
<p>sers, which struck the drop curtain and rolled on the stage.
</p>
<p>Beside this, the riotous demeanour and expressions of the
</p>
<p>Traversers will be developed; and from the strength of this
</p>
<p>connected evidence, coupled with what afterwards occurred ui
</p>
<p>a public tavern, you cannot have a rational doubt of the guilt
</p>
<p>of the prisoners."
</p>
<p>[The learned Attorney General here adverted to the modd
</p>
<p>of proceeding by Ex-officio, and entered into a defence of its
</p>
<p>legality, and the necessity that existed, under the present cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, of resorting to it ; he quoted several Law Autho*
</p>
<p>rities in support of his opinion, and_of its being strictly legal
</p>
<p>and constitutional. 3
</p>
<p>" I have, (he continued) authorities in abundance, if ne-
</p>
<p>cessary, but I had considered it a waste of the time of the
</p>
<p>Court, to discuss ths recognition of a known and established
</p>
<p>le^al principle. I further submit, that the throwing out of a
</p>
<p>Bill by a Grand Jury, is no bar to further legal proceedings.
</p>
<p>It is, undoubtedly, a rule of law, that 'no man can be twice
</p>
<p>tried for the same offence; but a Grand Jury do not try, they

</p>
<p>only determine to put a man on his trial. This is a marked and
</p>
<p>evident distinction between the free opinions of a Grand and
</p>
<p>Petit Jury, and if the former throw out the Bills, I should be
</p>
<p>glad to know, whether or not the Plaintiff and Defendant do
</p>
<p>not stand in the same relation, as they had done before the in-
</p>
<p>stitution of the proceedings. The not finding of the Bills,
</p>
<p>fs frequently assigned as additional cause for the institution of
</p>
<p>fresh proceedings. This was lately decided in $heil v. Patter-
</p>
<p>son, within the recollection of all your Lordships. In the
</p>
<p>Portsmouth case too, where the Bills had been twice ignored,.
</p>
<p>an information was granted in the King's Bench  But there
</p>
<p>is also another case in 3 Bun. where Lord Mansfield says to
</p>
<p>De Grey, Attorney General, or Sir Fletcher Norton, (I forget
</p>
<p>which; ) * That V the lowest subject was not righted by a
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>Grand Jury, the King's Bench will interfere." If then this
</p>
<p>privilege be* conceded to the lowest subject in the realm, sure
</p>
<p>a like privilege will not be denied to the King, or the King's
</p>
<p>officer. But there is another case, a theatrical one, which
</p>
<p>bears so close a resemblance to the present, that I cannot
</p>
<p>forbear quoting it, even at the risque of being tedious. My
</p>
<p>Lords and Gentlemen  You have all heard no doubt, of the
</p>
<p>celebrated Doctor Garth  Be it known to you then that this
</p>
<p>gentleman wrote a prologue; certainly, it was more grateful
</p>
<p>than sagacious, for it praised King William and libelled
</p>
<p>Queen Anne. At the representation the actors refused i*
</p>
<p>repeat the prologue by reason of the libel. Mr. Dudley
</p>
<p>Moore, however a zealous protestant, jumped on the stage and
</p>
<p>repeated the prologue amidst the applause of the auditory.
</p>
<p>Moore was indicted, and a true bill foundbut the jurors
</p>
<p>having been dismissed returned in half an hour, and stated
</p>
<p>that "Billa vera'* was a mistake, and that ignoramus should
</p>
<p>have been the return (laughter).  And to this fact the twenty-
</p>
<p>three jurors swore. The Attorney General then moved to
</p>
<p>quash the indictment and succeeded ; but he also filed an ex-
</p>
<p>officio information for the same offence. Sir Constantine Phipps
</p>
<p>however, one of the Lords Justices, and Chancellor of Ireland,
</p>
<p>interfered improperly with the jury and lectured the Lord
</p>
<p>Mayor. For this offence he was summoned before the privy
</p>
<p>council, who addressed the crown to dismiss him, and retail
</p>
<p>the Attorney General who had properly filed the ex-officio."
</p>
<p>The Attorney General, in conclusion, entreated the jury to
</p>
<p>give a patient and attentive hearing to the evidence that would
</p>
<p>be produced ; and he had no doubt whatever of being able to
</p>
<p>fully establish the charge brought against the traverser!.

<p>SECOND DAY.
</p>
<p>The Court sat at nine o'clock this morning.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice and Judges J ebb, Burton, and Vandeleur
</p>
<p>-having taken their seats on the Bench, and the Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the Jury having answered to their names, the several Traver-
</p>
<p>gers were called; they answered severally to their names,
</p>
<p>after which the first witness called on the part Of the Crow*
</p>
<p>wa$ John Atkinson .
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>Mr.- Serjeant Lefro^, after stating that on account of the
</p>
<p>absence of some of the witnesses, he and his colleagues would
</p>
<p>deviate from the order of the evidence which they had intended
</p>
<p>to pursue, desired the crier to call
</p>
<p>Joan Atkinson
</p>
<p>Who being sworn, was examined by the Solicitor General.
</p>
<p>Do you remember the night .the Lord Lieutenant went to
</p>
<p>the Theatre- Royal ? I do, Sir. Was his Excellency's inten-
</p>
<p>tion known to you before? It was, Sir. Do you remember
</p>
<p>meet it) g with any person, at any time prior to the night of his
</p>
<p>Excellency's going to the Theatre, and do you remember
</p>
<p>speaking on the subject to any such person ? Yes, I do- Had
</p>
<p>you mor-e than one meeting at which his Excellency's intention
</p>
<p>was the subject of conversation at the meeting ? Yes ; I
</p>
<p>heard it mentioned more than once. I ask you whether you
</p>
<p>were in company with any persons when his Excellency's inten-f
</p>
<p>tion was the subject of conversation, and whether it occurred
</p>
<p>more than once ? It did. When did the first of the meetings
</p>
<p>take place  was it one, two, or three days before his Excel-
</p>
<p>lency went to the Theatre? It was a few .days previous; I
</p>
<p>can t immediately mention the day. Do you remember going
</p>
<p>to the Shakespeare Tavern and speaking there with persons on
</p>
<p>the subject, previous to his Excellency's going to the Theatre ?

<p>I do ; 1 was there on one night before the time. Do you re-
</p>
<p>member what that night was ; was it two or three nights pre-

<p>( Here Mr. Blackburne objected to the question, because
</p>
<p>one of the Traversers was connected by the evidence, with
</p>
<p>the Shakespeare Tavern.)
</p>
<p>Question by the Solicitor Genera!  You recollect that there
</p>
<p>was a meeting at the Shakespeare, at which the last witness
</p>
<p>who was examined was present ? ( Here the Attorney General
</p>
<p>explained the circumstances of the previous meeting. ) The
</p>
<p>Solicitor General, in continuation, said, I wrjtfju'st mentioning
</p>
<p>that there was a previous meeting, and that tiio former witness
</p>
<p>had connected this meeting at the Shakespeare, with .the one
</p>
<p>here,
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll  He does, but in an imperfect way.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General  I will make it perfect for vou,.
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice observed, that it having been said in the
</p>
<p>presence of Forbes that there was a meeting, at which they
</p>
<p>had determined to do what would make the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>unpopular, the evidence could be connected.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driseoll admitted the general principle of the law, but
</p>
<p>contended the law did not apply.
</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Johnson said that it would be carrying evidence
</p>
<p>beyond its proper limits, if when one man comes to another
</p>
<p>and tells him that there is to be a meeting, and if it should
</p>
<p>be maintained, that all that takes place at that meeting i*
</p>
<p>evidence against the man who told the other that there would
</p>
<p>be such a meeting. The last witness did distinctly say that
</p>
<p>he would not swear that he had heard the Lord Lieutenant's
</p>
<p>name mentioned. But he (Mr. Johnson) would suppose that
</p>
<p>the witness had heard it mentioned  still that would not make
</p>
<p>it evidence- If one man say9 that a meeting took place, upoa
</p>
<p>what principle is it that all the facts connected with that
</p>
<p>meeting, or all the consequences of the meeting, shoulcL.be
</p>
<p>evidence against that man ? When that meeting is brought
</p>
<p>forward, it may refer to some other meeting different from the
</p>
<p>insulated evidence of having heard that a meeting took place.
</p>
<p>Mr. North, after having explained the nature of the rule
</p>
<p>of evidence, which he declared to be founded on good sense,
</p>
<p>said, that whenever a number of persons are in pursuit of one
</p>
<p>common object, the declaration of the sentiments of one of
</p>
<p>them was evidence against the others ; but that the rule never
</p>
<p>extended to this  that the statement made by one of them.
</p>
<p>that a fact took place, can be evidence of that fact. Let A
</p>
<p>and B have conspired to effect a common purpose, an act done
</p>
<p>by B in pursuit of that purpose is evidence against A ; but if
</p>
<p>b says against A, that such a person is knocked down in the
</p>
<p>street, that statement cannot be evidence against A. Mr, North
</p>
<p>continued to argue with great zeal, and in suppbrt of his
</p>
<p>opinion, quoted the case of Hardy, Tooke, and others. Mr.

</p>
<p>Hamilton, after alluding to the authority quoted by Mr. North,
</p>
<p>argued that such evidence was inadmissible.
</p>
<p>The Court over-ruled the objection, declaring, that the
</p>
<p>evidence ought to be admitted, because the persons who were
</p>
<p>assembled at the one meeting were assembled at the other, ancl
</p>
<p>because there was a community of object at the two assemblies,
</p>
<p>which would make what commenced at the one, evidence of
</p>
<p>the nature of the object at the second. There was evidence
</p>
<p>that the thing which commenced and which passed at the
</p>
<p>Shakespeare, was commenced aad acted on at Werburgh-street,
</p>
<p>In short there was evidence to go to the Jury, that t!iemeet
</p>
<p>ing at the Shakespeare and the meeting at Werbj: ^-sir^t,
</p>
<p>weresevetal parts of the the one conspiracy. All the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators are not proved to have been at both the meeting*.
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>The examination was then resumed by the Solicitor General.
</p>
<p>Q. The conversation turned at the Shakespeare on the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant's intended visit to the Theatre ; was any thing done
</p>
<p>in consequence of his going to the Theatre ?  Yes, Sir ; it was
</p>
<p>mentioned that some people should be sent thei'e on the night of
</p>
<p>his going to the Theatre. (J For what particular purpose was
</p>
<p>it agreed on, and what was concerted at that meeting for the
</p>
<p>sending of the persons to the Theatre ?  I cannot be very par-
</p>
<p>ticular, because it was at an advanced hour of the night ; the
</p>
<p>subject, as far as I can remember 
</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Johnson, K. C.  What the witness is now go-
</p>
<p>ing to say will not be evidence ; he is not u> give conclusions,
</p>
<p>but statements of facts.
</p>
<p>Here the Chief Justice explained to the witness that he was
</p>
<p>not bound to state the exact words, though, on the other hand
</p>
<p>he was not allowed to give his own conceptions, but o^y the
</p>
<p>substance of what had passed.
</p>
<p>Q. Now recollect what occurred respecting the Lord Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant ? It was mentioned by one or two others to raise a fund
</p>
<p>to buy tickets, to be given to the people, and to send them td
</p>
<p>the Theatre. Q. For what purpose were they to be sent to the
</p>
<p>Theatre ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll objected to the question.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice. Was it discussed or mentioned for what
</p>
<p>purpose the men were to be sent to the Theatre ? Because his
</p>
<p>Excellency was going to the Theatre, it was to render him, I
</p>
<p>suppose unpopular. The Chief Justice.  You are not, Sir, to
</p>
<p>say what you suppose.  It was for the purpose of rendering the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant unpopular, or words to that effect. Q. You
</p>
<p>have said, sir, that the object was to render the Lord Lieute-
</p>
<p>nant unpopular, and that words were mentioned to that effect.
</p>
<p>1 ask you, Sir, was any mention made of what would result
</p>
<p>from that unpopularity ? Yes  that it might cause his removal.
</p>
<p> Q. Will you just listen to me  As it was passed at the meet-

<p>ing that tickets would be bought, and that men would be sent
</p>
<p>to the Theatre, the object was to render the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>unpopular in the country, and to remove him, the consequences
</p>
<p>were immediate and remote. -Yes, Sir. Q. As to the conse-
</p>
<p>quences which were to be immediate at the Theatre, what wa*
</p>
<p>che immediate object there with respect to the Lord Lieutenant,
</p>
<p>by sending the men ? It was mentioned that it might cause him
</p>
<p>to leave the Theatre. Q. Am I right in understanding you as
</p>
<p>having said that the second object was to make him leave the
</p>
<p>country ? Yes. Q. Am I right in stating as your evidence, that
</p>
<p>tickets were bought, & that men were to be sent to the Theatre
</p>
<p>for the immediate purpose of making him quit theTheatre, and
</p>
<p>that the remote object was to make him quit the country ? It
</p>
<p>.was. Q. Did you receive any subscriptions for carrying into
</p>
<p>effect the plan ? I did. Q. For what jmrpote was it given ?
</p>
<p>s
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>It was not mentioned at the time I received it. Q. You sai(J
</p>
<p>that when you were in the Shakespeare, it was mentioned that
</p>
<p>money was to be raised? It was mentioned the night before,
</p>
<p>that money would be sent to me ; and the next day it was sent
</p>
<p>to me under a blank cover. Do you know the hand- writing
</p>
<p>which was ou,ihe blank cover. I am not sure of it. Do you
</p>
<p>know who the person was who sent you the money ? I know
</p>
<p>the person who said he would send it to me ; it was Mr. Heron*
</p>
<p>who said he would send it to me. Who is he? He holds a
</p>
<p>public employment; I hear he holds a situation in a public of-
</p>
<p>fice  in the post-office. Have you seen him acting in the post-
</p>
<p>office ? I never saw him. Did you ever see him in the cus-
</p>
<p>tom-house ? He is reported to be so.
</p>
<p>Here the Attorney-General said, that is quite sufficient.
</p>
<p>Q. How were the persons who were to be treated with tickets
</p>
<p>to be employed ; what part of the bouse were they to be sent to ?
</p>
<p>To the upper gallery. What was agreed upon ? It was agreed
</p>
<p>upon that they were to be sent to the upper gallery. Why to the
</p>
<p>upper gallery and not to any other part of the House ? It was
</p>
<p>not considered necessary to send them to the other parts of the
</p>
<p>House.
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Robert Johnson, made a remark on the kind of
</p>
<p>witness which was on the table, when the Attorney General
</p>
<p>immediately said, that Council had no right to throw out impu-
</p>
<p>tations against the witness. Mr. Johnson said he had a right to
</p>
<p>do so ; but the Chief Justice declared that the observation made
</p>
<p>on the witness, while on his ^direct testimony, was not right.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson explained and argued that he was right ; but the
</p>
<p>Chief Justice said, what I object to is this ; you assail the wit-
</p>
<p>ness in the hearing of the Jury, and ) 7 ou allude to & particular
</p>
<p>circumstance, which observation ought not to be made ; whea
</p>
<p>you shall address the Jury just now, you can make any observa-
</p>
<p>tion which you please connected with the case, but you shall not

</p>
<p>be at liberty, during the progress of the trial, to make such ob.
</p>
<p>servations ; we will not allow it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson said, he was sorry for the observation, but
</p>
<p>conceived that he had the right to make it.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General in continuation. Q. I am alluding to
</p>
<p>the meeting at the Shakespeare ; now, sir, I ask you was there
</p>
<p>any reason assigned, or talked of, why all the men should be
</p>
<p>sent to the gallery, and none to the Boxes or Pit ? There was *
</p>
<p>ason assigned ; it was mentioned that there would be plenty
</p>
<p>go to the rest of the Jlouse, and to treat themselves. Do
</p>
<p>ou remember seeing any of the persons again on any subse-
</p>
<p>quent occasion ? I do sir. On what occasion ? I saw them on>

</p>
<p>house ? At Daly's in Werburgh-street. Whom did you see at
</p>
<p>^hat time ? I saw Mr. Stoker and Mr. Heron. Did you see any
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>f the Traversers who are here, I mean that are in Court ? (Af-
</p>
<p>ter a pause, looking about him.) I saw Handwich. Do 5 ou
</p>
<p>remember which Handwich ? I believe his name is Henry.
</p>
<p>Do you know his person ? I do. Do you see him here in Com 1 ?
</p>
<p>I do. Tell me who were there on that occasion ? Do you mean
</p>
<p>in the evening ? Solicitor Genera]. Yes. A Mr. Fletcher was
</p>
<p>there. Do you remember any other ? Mr. Stoker's brother v as
</p>
<p>there. Do you know any other. No answer. Were there se-
</p>
<p>veral persons there ? I don't recollect any more. Was there any
</p>
<p>conversation on the subject of the Theatre ? There was. What?
</p>
<p>was the nature of that conversation ? There was a deal relative
</p>
<p>to the subject. It was about the mode of going up to the up*
</p>
<p>per gallery, and how they should conduct themselves there.
</p>
<p>Was there any conversation how they would go ? There was ;
</p>
<p>Handwich was asked to get some people to go to the Theatre.
</p>
<p>Did you a:rmge any thing about the manner, or how they
</p>
<p>were to conduct themselves at the Play ? It was mentioned that ,
</p>
<p>after " God Save the King'' was played, they should call for
</p>
<p>?5 The Boyne Water." What were they to do after that ; upon
</p>
<p>calling for " The Boyne Water." what were they to do ? They
</p>
<p>were to endeavour to get it. If it was not got, what were they to
</p>
<p>do then ? They were to interfere and to endeavour to prevent
</p>
<p>the performance from going on. Was any thing mentioned re-
</p>
<p>latiAe to the Lord Lieutenant on that night f The witness re-
</p>
<p>mained silent. Do 3 r ou remember any thing having been said
</p>
<p>relative to the Lord Lieutenant ? Another pause. If not, Sir,
</p>
<p>you need not mention what you thought ? It was also mentioned
</p>
<p>that the Lord Lieutenant might, probably, be compelled to
</p>
<p>withdraw from the Theatre. Do you remember after that, call-
</p>
<p>ing any where for the purpose of seeing Handwich ? I did call
</p>
<p>to see him. Where did you call? I called at Dominick-st., at
</p>
<p>Mr. Colburn's the carpenters. Was it previous to going to the
</p>
<p>Theatre ? It was previous ; it was on the morning of the same
</p>
<p>day. Was that previous or subsequent to the meeting at Wer-

<p>Jmrgh-street? It was previous. Did you see Handwich there ?
</p>
<p>No ; I saw his brother. Had yon any conversation with his bro-
</p>
<p>ther ? I merely said that I wanted to see his brother. Do you
</p>
<p>see him among the Traversers ? I do not see him there.
</p>
<p>It was here mentioned in Court tjiat Handwich had more
</p>
<p>than one brother,
</p>
<p>Q. All you did then is this, that you asked for his brother
</p>
<p>Henry ? Yes, and to inform him that I wanted to see him,
</p>
<p>J)id you see him afterwards ? I did ; in Werburgh- street. Did
</p>
<p>you ask him any questions relative to the plan ? I do not recol-
</p>
<p>lect ; he got his instructions from Mr. Heron and Mr. Stoker
</p>
<p>relative to the way in which he and they were to conduct them-
</p>
<p>selves at the Theatre. Whom do you mean by " they' 1  The
</p>
<p>individuals. What individuals ? I mean the men Handwich
</p>
<p>was to bring with him to the Theatre.
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>'Witness went on to state in answer to tlie question* pro-
</p>
<p>pose*! to him, that he did not know the exact number of per-
</p>

</p>
<p>the Theatre ; money was subscribed to purchase tickets ; be-

<p>or from the Lodge ; can't swear which he-got it from ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Stoker or Mr. Heron, but had it from either ; had four pounds
</p>
<p>in all ; witness handed the most part of it over for the purpose

<p>of purchasing tickets. Tickets were purchased ; Mr. M'Cul-
</p>
<p>iagh and Mr. Forbes went into the Theatre for the purpose of

</p>
<p>sons that night, amongst whom tickets had been distributed ;
</p>
<p>saw them as they came into the room ; there was not a great
</p>
<p>many of them ; some of them had sticks with big heads upon
</p>
<p>them ; witness saw handbills in the Theatre ; did not see them
</p>
<p>before; don't remember any sign, or watch word having been
</p>
<p>agreed on, by which the party might recognise each other;
</p>
<p>witness went to the Theatre that nrght ; went first to the gal-
</p>
<p>lery, afterwards went down to the boxes ; witness would noC
</p>
<p>know Handwich's men. When they came for their tickets, they

<p>just came and went; Forbes, M'Culiagh, witness's brother,
</p>
<p>and himself, went straight to the upper gallery ; they first
</p>
<p>went to the upper gallery ; they afterwards went to the upper

</p>
<p>a rattle there ; can't say who had it ; the rattle was in Ship-
</p>
<p>street ; there was a bottle there.
</p>
<p>Were there more whistles than one ? Yes. Where did they
</p>
<p>get them ? They got them at Daly's in Ship street. Was it
</p>
<p>Daly the witness said ? Do you mean to say that they were
</p>
<p>supplied there ? A pause. Who supplied them ? A pause.
</p>
<p>Did you supply them ? I did altogether. You told us that
</p>
<p>you had got the stock purse ? I had, Sir. Did you see a.
</p>
<p>jattle there ? There was a rattle there ; but I did not see who
</p>
<p>had it.
</p>
<p>Question by the Chief Justice.  WTiere did you aee the
</p>
<p>rattle? In Ship street.
</p>
<p>Examination resumed by the Solicitor General.  Did you
</p>
<p>*ee the bottle there ? I did. What kind of a bottle ? A black
</p>
<p>bottle. Did you hear any conversation with any of the party
</p>
<p>about a bottle having been thrown ? I heard there was ; but
</p>
<p>I was in the lobby at the time that it was thrown. Was it-
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Driscoll objected to the question, because the wit-
</p>
<p>ness said that he had not been in the Theatre when the bottle
</p>
<p>was thrown.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice.  That is not evidence, Mr. Driscoll.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General is following it up.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  I agree with Mr. Driscoll, that yon
</p>
<p>fan't ask that question as to effect any of the Traversers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Solicitor-General.  Is it not to any part of a concerted
</p>
<p>plan ?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  What is said is not evidence, unless said by
</p>
<p>one of themselves. Did you hear from any of the prisoners ;
</p>
<p>I mean at any time, or at any place ; did you hear of the
</p>
<p>throwing of the bottle ? After a pause; It was mentioned in
</p>
<p>general conversation in Essex-street. The Chief Justice said
</p>
<p>*hat could not be given as evidence, unless connected with
</p>
<p>some of the traversers. Who were present in Essex-street ;

<p>in who*e house was it ? Witness.  Which house do you

<p>General answered in the affirmative. The witness then said  :
</p>
<p>here were some of the prisoners there that night: William
</p>
<p>Graham was there, Forbes was there, and Brownlow was there.
</p>
<p>Were any others of the Traversers there ? There were others
</p>
<p>there. Was your brother there ? He was. Do you mean to
</p>
<p>say, that you heard a conversation about the bottle being
</p>
<p>thrown? Yes, Sir, it was mentioned. Come, as well as you
</p>
<p>can recollect, tell what you heard ; I don't want to know what
</p>
<p>the exact words were? (After a pause.) I can't recollect
</p>
<p>any conversation, only it was mentioned as having been done.
</p>
<p>Was any remark made on it ; I don t mean that you should
</p>
<p>recollect the words* but the substance only ; was there any
</p>
<p>^remark made, or any opinion expressed by any person on im
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>r
</p>
<p>subject ? (After a long pause.) I can't bring any thit>^ t
</p>
<p>my mind-
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll said, that the Counsel for Traversers had agreed
</p>
<p>among themselves not to cross-examine the witnesses, unless
</p>
<p>on points connected with their respective clients, lest they
</p>
<p>should unnecessarily occupy the time of the Court.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said, that the Law Officers of the
</p>
<p>Crown had no objection to any latitude which the Counsel for
</p>
<p>the Traversers might be inclined to take in the examination,
</p>
<p>or cross-examination of witnesses, or in speaking to evidence.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr, Rolleiton. '
</p>
<p>Witness said that he had an office of about 901. a year under
</p>
<p>Government. Have you any means of support ? None  -
</p>
<p>Your father ha3also a place under the Government ? He has.
</p>
<p>Has he any other means of support? He has. What is it ?
</p>
<p>His profession as an Attorney. Does he practice ? He does
</p>
<p>whenever he gets it. ( A laugh. ) Did your father take out a
</p>
<p>license this year ? I can't say. You have a brother who was
</p>
<p>examined here yesterday, has he any place ? He has no place.
</p>
<p>Does he expect one ? I can't form an opinion on the subject.
</p>
<p>You would not like t lose your own place? I would not.
</p>
<p>Don't you hold it at ths will of the Government? I can't
</p>
<p>answer that question* Don't you think that the Government
</p>
<p>would turn you out if they disliked you ? I can't say how far
</p>
<p>they would. Don't you believe it ? I can't answer that ques-
</p>
<p>tion  I am not sure. Don't you think in your own mind that
</p>
<p>great deal depends on your swearing this day for your holding
</p>
<p>your own situation, and for your father holding his ? I can't
</p>
<p>say. What is your belief? What is the reflection in your,
</p>
<p>own mind f No answer.
</p>
<p>Witness  Repeat the question  Don't it depend on your
</p>
<p>swearing this day, whether you and your father will hold your
</p>
<p>places  that is, whether that is not the belief in your own pure

<p>mind? (A laugh.)  It was not under such an impression I
</p>
<p>came here. Eut can you form any opinion. Upon your oath
</p>
<p>don't you think that your place would be more secure if your
</p>
<p>evidence could convict the traversers? It is a thing I can't
</p>
<p>give you any answer on ; I never thought of it before. Had
</p>
<p>you any place before this which you now hold ? I had. Were
</p>
<p>you turned out of it ? I lost it when it was abolished. (A laugh)
</p>
<p>I was not turned out of it. (A laugh.) But you got no com-
</p>
<p>pensatioa? (A laugh.) No (A laugh.) You came here to
</p>
<p>wear conspiracy against the traversers and others ? I came here
</p>
<p>to give testimony. Are you not come here to swear that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was formed ? I came here to give testimony. WiU
</p>
<p>you not answer me ; on your oath are you not come to swear
</p>
<p>o ? , I came here to give testimony ; I do not know whether
</p>
<p>it is a conspiracy i I am not sufficiently learned ia the- law to
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>know that. But having a place under Government you would
</p>
<p>not enter into any conspiracy against the Government  a man
</p>
<p>So pure as you are would not do so ? (A laugh.) Not know-
</p>
<p>ingly or willingly. I know you would not ; you, a pure man,
</p>
<p>would not enter into a conspiracy. (A laugh.)  But would
</p>
<p>you, having a place under the Government, and a man of such
</p>
<p>purity, would you associate with conspirators against that Go-
</p>
<p>vernment ? Not knowingly ; I would not. I know you ixere
</p>
<p>a good subject. ( A laugh.) Were you not often with Forbes ?
</p>
<p>I was often in his company. Did you dine with him last
</p>
<p>Sunday ? Not lately. But you supped with him ? No. Did
</p>
<p>you with M'Cullagh ? Not with M'Cullagh. You are fencing
</p>
<p>with me did you dine with any -of them ? I mean any of the
</p>
<p>persons included in the charge of conspiracy? Not one of
</p>
<p>them. Were you drinking with them ? I was. j[ A laugh.)
</p>
<p>When ? On ia?t Sunday evening. Are you not'on most in-
</p>
<p>timate habits of friendship with Forbes ? I have been. Surely
</p>
<p>you that hold places under the Government, would not asso-
</p>
<p>ciate with Forbes, if you did not think him a loyal man ? I
</p>
<p>would not. So I think. And so I did. Frora % the intimate
</p>
<p>knowledge you have of him, would not you convict him of
</p>
<p>loyalty? I would certainly. (A laugh.) Do you think that
</p>
<p>there is ^ man on earth more attached to his Sovereign and
</p>
<p>Government, than Forbes ? I think there is no man. You
</p>
<p>would tind him guilty of that? (A laugh.) Yes, if it was a
</p>
<p>crime, (A laugh.)
</p>
<p>Mr Rolleston. Sometimes it appears that it is a crime to
</p>
<p>be loyal... (loud laughing and clapping of hands in several parts
</p>
<p>of the Court.) Will you inform me what situation you hold in
</p>
<p>the Orange Lodge ? I am a Deputy Master of a Lodge  ( A
</p>
<p>laugh) You are only approaching to the purple. ( A laugh.)
</p>
<p>I ask you if yon had any rank ; I ask you what rank you hold
</p>
<p>in the Lodge ? Deputy Master. Is your brother of any
</p>
<p>rank? He is Secretary. Y r ou and your brother must have con-

<p>siderable influence in the Lodge? I can't say we have. (A
</p>
<p>laugh.) What! You a Deputy Master, and not have influ-
</p>
<p>ence ? I have not any influence. (A laugh.) 1 am not speak-
</p>
<p>ing of what you have novo ; but had not you considerable influ-
</p>
<p>ence ? I can't say I had. Now did they elect you, not having
</p>
<p>any influence? no answer. 1 suppose they did not know yov
</p>
<p>at that time as well as they do now? (A laugh.) no answer.
</p>
<p>You say you have had no influence. On your oath I ask you if
</p>
<p>you had ? I can't say I had. As you mentioned something
</p>
<p>about the Shakespeare, I presume that, as the Master of the
</p>
<p>Lodge, you did not quit it sober? (A laugh.) no answer.
</p>
<p>Were vou quite sober at the opening of the Lodge. ( A laugh)
</p>
<p>Jhere'was no Lodge there at all. It was half past 12 o'clock
</p>
<p>when you w-ejat ; did^you uet communicate to tiiejn something?
</p>
<p>M
</p>
<p>I forget. Who went for Handwich? I did. For what pirN

<p>pose ? According to the instructions which I received from Mr.
</p>
<p>Stoker and Mr. Heron, I went to Handwich. Did you com-
</p>
<p>municate to them what instructions you received? I did. When
</p>
<p>you came in, was there a Lodge held that night ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney General. What night do you speak of ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston. Thursday night.
</p>
<p>Witness. I don't think there was a Lodge held that night.
</p>
<p>But you had some conversation about making the Lord Lieute-

</p>
<p>lead this conversation? no answer. Don't you know the Mas*
</p>
<p>ter leads ? (A laugh) I did not ; I joined in the conversation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stoker and Mr. Heron were there? Yes. Did you not
</p>
<p>join in the plot f I did. Did you assent to every syllable of it 
</p>
<p>I did not then look to the evil tendency of it. What ! You, *
</p>
<p>loyal man, holding places under Government, did you join in
</p>
<p>the plot ? I did not think any thing about it. But you tell of
</p>
<p>others, that it was improper to join the plot ? I did not then;
</p>
<p>think it improper ; I did not act with proper caution at the time.
</p>
<p>You did not dissuade any of them ? No, Sir. You did not use?
</p>
<p>your influence to prevent them from carrying their intentions in-
</p>
<p>to effect f No, I did not then see the evil of it. Might not
</p>
<p>Forbes and others conceive it to be perfectly innocent at the*
</p>
<p>time ? I do, Sir, think, that they might have looked on it ia
</p>
<p>the same light as I did at that time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston. That is, in other words, that their mind*
</p>
<p>were as pure as your own! (A laugh) Can you favor the Jury
</p>
<p>with any thing you said in the Lodge on the next night f No
</p>
<p>answer. Forbes did not belong to that Lodge ? No, Sir. Was
</p>
<p>he not sent for as a visitor ? I believe not. Had you seen Forbes
</p>
<p>before supper ? I don't recollect f Is not the Lodge always
</p>
<p>closed before supper ? Always. What did you say when Forbes
</p>
<p>came in ? No answer. Do you forget ? I do, Sir, Then you
</p>
<p>can't recollect any thing you said on that night ? (After a pause)

<p>speaking of the business. For what purpose did you give the
</p>
<p>money ? To purchase the tickets. Did you not stand outside of
</p>
<p>the play-house door till the tickets were bought? I did. Who
</p>
<p>got the tickets then ? I got ^he tickets, and I handed them over,
</p>
<p>according to the instructions I had received, to Handwich. You

<p>did not at the time endeavour to dissimde Handwich from

</p>
<p>I only bought some of them. Quite innocent indeed! How

<p>much money did yon pay for the whistles. I- forget.

</p>
<p>was the first toast ? I forget the first toast. On your oath
</p>
<p>was it not " the King?" I believe he did give the King-
</p>
<p>Did he not give it with three times three  that surely was not
</p>
<p>disloyal. (A laugh.) Did not Forbes drink the King with all

<p>the Duke of York and the Army as the next toast ? I forget.

</p>
<p>oath do you forget? I do. Did he not give '* the Glorious,

<p>Pious, and Immortal Memory," with three times three ? He
</p>
<p>did. Did any man ever give it with more animation ? He
</p>
<p>did. Did he not give it with rapture ? He did. Did he not

<p>give the Glorious Constitution under which we live ? II

<p>ous Constitution in Church and Stete ? He did. How long
</p>
<p>did "he stay there ? (After a pause)  we must have waited
</p>
<p>some time, for we supped. Did he not say that no true

</p>
<p>Is it one of their principles to support, tojthe utmost of their*
</p>
<p>power, the King and his Majesty's Government? It is to that
</p>
<p>effect. Is it not a part to support the Constitution and the laws
</p>
<p>of the Country ? Yes. Is it not also a part to maintain the
</p>
<p>succession to the throne to his Majesty's illustrious house ?
</p>
<p>Being Protestants it is. Is it not also a part, to defend person
</p>
<p>and property against fraud, violence, and ^injustice, and to
</p>
<p>maintain the peace of the Country ? It is. Is fit not a part
</p>
<p>to be always ready to assisrthe civil and military power in the

<p>support the honor of King William of glorious memory ?

</p>
<p>your power? Yes You took that oath? I did. All the
</p>
<p>persons implicated here this day have taken the same oath ?
</p>
<p>I suppose they did ; I saw some of them take it. What place
</p>
<p>did you hold? 1 held several. Did you take the oath of al-
</p>
<p>legiance in any one of them ? In the last I did. Your bro-
</p>
<p>ther was at the meeting on Saturday f Yes. You did not
</p>
<p>hear any agreement for a watch-word ? I did not. You were
</p>
<p>as bound as others ? I was. Did you know any thing about
</p>
<p>your brother's scruples ? Not until a few days ago. Did he
</p>
<p>communicate to you his scruples ? Not at the time. Y r ou say
</p>
<p>you thought it innocent to do all the acts which you men-
</p>
<p>tioned ? I beg pardon ; I said that I did not look into the
</p>
<p>fcvil tendency of it then. Was not your brother of the same
</p>
<p>way of thinking ? I had no reason to suppose the contrary.
</p>
<p>Do you know the public Paper called The Warder? I do.
</p>
<p>Do you ever read it ? Sometimes. You read jtonce a week f
</p>
<p>No always; sometimes I read it.

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Speer, on bfhalf of Henry Hahdwick,
</p>
<p>Did you see any person in the gallery you knew ? I saw
</p>
<p>Henry Handwich.
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Scriven, handing a newspaper to the witnes?,
</p>
<p>asked him whether he had ever seen the passage which wa3
</p>
<p>marked in it ? The witness said he had read it. The paper,
</p>
<p>after having been marked by one of the officers of the Court,
</p>
<p>was handed to the Jury.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed by Mr. Speer.
</p>
<p>Where in the gallery was Henry Handwich ? I think he
</p>
<p>was sitting in the centre ; but I am not sure whether he was
</p>
<p>fitting in the centre, or on one side. Did you see any thing
</p>
<p>with him ? I saw nothing but a stick ? Will you venture to
</p>
<p>swear that he had even a stick f I do. Did he do any thing
</p>
<p>offensive to the Lord Lieutenant ? I saw him do nothing

<p>"offensive to the Lord Lieutenant. Nothing ? Nothing.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. North.
</p>
<p>Was it a part of your agreement to assault or offer per-
</p>
<p>sonal violence to the Lord Lieutenant? None at all. Did
</p>
<p>you not advise the persons not to bring sticks f I did. Did
</p>
<p>you not give the advice lest violence should take place ? I was
</p>
<p>not afraid of violence being offered to the Lord Lieutenant ;
</p>
<p>but lest there should be a row in the upper gallery. Woultf
</p>
<p>you swear that it was the intention of any of the persons, to
</p>
<p>offer persqnal violence to the I^ord Lieutenant f I would
</p>
<p>almost swear the contrary.
</p>
<p>Question by a Juror.  You said a bottle was taken to the
</p>
<p>Theatre ? No ; I said that the bottle was taken out of the
</p>
<p>room from the house. You can't swear it was taken to th@
</p>
<p>Theatre f I cannot.

</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General here requested io know what the
</p>
<p>witness had said; and on referring to the evidence, it ap-
</p>
<p>peared tl. at be had said, that the bottle had been taken from
</p>
<p>t he house, but not that it had been taken to the Theatre.
</p>
<p>Mr. John Lambert xvas sveorn.  Examined by Mr. Serjeant
</p>
<p>Lefroy.
</p>
<p>Witness said that he was in the pit of the Play-house on the
</p>
<p>night the Lord Lieutenant was insulted ; he was there before
</p>
<p>the Lord Lieutenant entered the Theatre ; he observed pla-
</p>
<p>cards, or little handbills, about the house, but he did not get
</p>
<p>one of them ; he saw a person handing the handbills about ;
</p>
<p>would know the person again.
</p>
<p>Here the witness identified William Graham, after having
</p>
<p>first desired Graham to take off a pair of temple spectacles ;
</p>
<p>he saw William Graham also busily engaged in hissing and
</p>
<p>groaning ; Win. Graham began first to hiss and groan on the
</p>
<p>entrance of the Lord Lieutenant'into the Theatre; William
</p>
<p>Graham also repeated the same things during the night; he
</p>
<p>was doing so during the first two or three acts of the play;
</p>
<p>witness saw Graham communicating with a number of per-
</p>
<p>sons who were employed in the same WM% in hissing and
</p>
<p>groaning ; witness also saw them communicating with Graham ;
</p>
<p>witness did not see any other person in the pit except Graham,
</p>
<p>distributing the hand-bills ; witness heard a great noise in the
</p>
<p>Theatre on that night by the hissing and clapping; he also
</p>
<p>heard the words, " look out boys" often shouted from the
</p>
<p>gallery ; the Lord Lieutenant was hissed and groaned ; witness
</p>
<p>heard them crying out, " a groan for Wellesley ;" witness
</p>
<p>also heard whistling in the gallery; witness said that the hand-
</p>
<p>bills which were distributed were printed hand-bills.
</p>
<p>In answer to Mr. North, who cross-examined the witness,
</p>
<p>he said that he lived in Chamber-street, and that he had not
</p>
<p>the honor to be an Orangeman ; that he was a Catholic by

<p>religion ; witness was in the house about half an hour before
</p>
<p>the Lord Lieutenant entered; he sat on the fourth, or fifth,
</p>
<p>or sixth seat from the stage ; William Graham was standing
</p>
<p>before witness, but witness cannot say whether he was one,
</p>
<p>two, or three seats distant ; he saw hand-bills dropped from
</p>
<p>the lattices, but it was after Graham had distributed hand-
</p>
<p>bills ; after the hand-bills dropped from the lattices, the
</p>
<p>people in the pit picked them up, but witness did not get
</p>
<p>one, as every person was so eager to get them ; witness saw
</p>
<p>Graham bring some in his hand into the pit and distribute
</p>
<p>them ; on his oath, he saw hand-bills in the pit before the
</p>
<p>hand-bills dropped from the lattices ; he could not describe
</p>
<p>any of the hand-bills because he did not get one. Witness
</p>
<p>swore, in answer to a question from Mr. North, that he saw
</p>
<p>Graham distribute 4 one, two, or three hand- bills, before tks
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>hand-bills dropped from the lattices ; never saw Graham be-
</p>
<p>fore that night ; nobody ever told witness that Graham is an
</p>
<p>Orangeman, but he believes him to be one ; witness clapped
</p>
<p>when the Lord Lieutenant entered the house ; William Gra-
</p>
<p>ham did not join in the cheers when the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>entered the house ; the Lord Mayor came in before the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant. Witness, in answer to a question from Mr.
</p>
<p>North, who asked whether he would swear that when Gra-
</p>
<p>ham bissed, he was not hissing the Lord Mayor, but the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant ; said that Graham hissed the Lord Mayor
</p>
<p>before the Lord Lieutenant entered the house ; witness saw
</p>
<p>Graham until the third act ; witness did not disclose the in-
</p>
<p>formation until he was sent for by Major Sirr ; he thinks that
</p>
<p>the information had been conveyed to Major Sirr by witness*!
</p>
<p>tailor, a Mr. Lane.
</p>
<p>Here Mr. North said, your tailor then stitched up the story
</p>
<p>for you. {A laugh.) j
</p>
<p>Witness did not tell Lane that it was Graham, because he
</p>
<p>did not know the name then; he gave a description of the
</p>
<p>man who was taken up, in consequence of the description of
</p>
<p>the man who was taken up, inl consequence df the descrip-
</p>
<p>tion ; Graham wore no spectacles in the Theatre. Q. Had
</p>
<p>you a stick in your hand ? No sir. Q, Then you left it at
</p>
<p>home ? No, Sir ; I never carry one*
</p>
<p>Question by a Juror Might not the hand-bills have fallen
</p>
<p>in another part of the house ? I saw them in the hands of
</p>
<p>Graham when he came Into the house.
</p>
<p>Question by the Court.  How soon did you describe
</p>
<p>Graham in the Police Omce ? On the Monday- week fol-
</p>
<p>lowing.

<p>had an opportunity of seeing the upper gallery ; witness obser-
</p>
<p>ved in the upper gallery a groupe of persons rushing into the
</p>
<p>gallery and shouting; he saw creeks, or watchmen's rattles,
</p>
<p>in the hands of some of those persons ; he saw persons use
</p>
<p>those, but he does not know their names ; he saw a knot of
</p>
<p>persons behind him in the gallery, and some of them had sticks
</p>
<p>under their coats; the sticks were short, and heavy in the
</p>
<p>bead; all the sticks were alike: he saw one or two sticks of
</p>
<p>the same kind in the upper gallery ; after he entered the house
</p>
<p>there were groans for the Lord Mayor  groans for the house
</p>
<p>pf Wedesley, from the upper gallery ; there was a clap for
</p>
<p>Sheriff Thorpe, and a clap for the calf's head  (a laugh )
</p>
<p>Q. What do you mean by the calfs head.
</p>
<p>Counsel for the Travel sers objected to the question, whiffy
</p>
<p>was over-ruled

</p>
<p>Witness saw hand bills thrown ; there was one thrown dow*
</p>
<p>-on the side of the Lord Lieutenant's box ; when the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant entered the Theatre, there wasapirtial groan and
</p>
<p>a general clap ; Sir Stewart Bruce took up the bill that fell
</p>
<p>isto the Lord Lieutenant's box ; witness did not interfere in
</p>
<p>an}' manner until there was a groan for the house of Wellesley ;
</p>
<p>witness then stood up and cried " shame, shame," some persona
</p>
<p>behind witness then cried out to others to knock witness
</p>
<p>down ; he observed something flash across his eyes, and ic
</p>
<p>struck the drop curtain on the stage, two or three feet from
</p>
<p>the Lord Lieutenant's box. It made a sort of dingt in the
</p>
<p>curtain, and having raised up part of the curtain, it fell and
</p>
<p>rolled towards the Jigbts ; he thought it was a bottle, before
</p>
<p>the musician took it up ; witness was looking towards the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant's box when it flashed before bis eyes, in its passage
</p>
<p>through the space between him and the lights on the stage - T
</p>
<p>he saw it was a bottie when the musician took it up.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. DriscolL
</p>
<p>Did you not say that you saw the object just glance before
</p>
<p>your eyes? Just glance  no, Sir. What! will you say
</p>
<p>that you do notssiy so? I think I did not say so, but as you
</p>
<p>say it, I suppose I did. Did you say so ? I suppose I did.
</p>
<p>Will you swear it it true ?
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  The witness did not say just glanced
</p>
<p>across his eyes  the witness explained, that while he was
</p>
<p>looking towards the Lord Lieutenant's box, the object caught
</p>
<p>his eye as it passed towards the lights.
</p>
<p>Question by Mr. Driscoll  How did you continue to see the
</p>
<p>short sticks when you told us a while ago that the sticks were
</p>
<p>under their coats?. When the Gentlemen they called Mr.
</p>
<p>Johnston was coming up to the gallery, they were pulling out
</p>
<p>the sticks before he came up.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General, looking at Mr. Driscoll  Do you
</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll ~I am quite satisfied with the answer.
</p>
<p>What is your business? The brewing business. Are yo*
</p>
<p>ot convinced that when tradesmen turn out for particular wa-
</p>
<p>ges, persons who will not join them in the combination are beat
</p>
<p>for not joining them, and are not men obliged to carry serious
</p>
<p>weapons for their own protection ? I believe so.
</p>
<p>When cross-examined by Mr. Perrin, the witness said that it
</p>
<p>was not unusual to see a rush into all parts of the house, or to
</p>
<p>hear shouting or hissing. There was a great deai cf groaning
</p>
<p>and hissing for the Lord Mayor; the Lord Lieutenant was well
</p>
<p>received, with the exception of two or three parts of the house :
</p>
<p>the noise was particularly violent at the latter part of" the play ;
</p>
<p>the Lord Lieutenant bowed to the Lord Mayor, and expressed
</p>
<p>his disapprobation of the hissing, and then "there was a ioa*
</p>
<p>S4
</p>
<p>for tie house of \Veiie^ey ; some person called him <e a bald-
</p>
<p>pated old rascal;" the lights were up at the time, because
</p>
<p>the witness saw the musician put his hand over them to take up
</p>
<p>the bottle ; the bottle struck the scene about half-way between
</p>
<p>the leader of the Band and the Lord lieutenant's box, about
</p>
<p>two or three feet from the Lord Lieutenant' s box.
</p>
<p>Mr. Charles O'Flakeiiy sworn  Examined by Mr, J. Scaly
</p>
<p>Town send.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre on the 14th December last, Mr'
</p>
<p>Burnside accompanied him there; sat in the lattices opposite to
</p>
<p>his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant; he heard great noises
</p>
<p>issuing from the gallery, but he could not distinguish the fea-
</p>
<p>tures of the persons : he heard words and groans _; he heard
</p>
<p>the words -f lookout"  ''lookout," or words similar ; the words
</p>
<p>appeared to witness as a signal ; (an objection was made to this
</p>
<p>answer, as not evidence;) the words were said more than once,
</p>
<p>but witness did not perceive any effect from them ; there were
</p>
<p>various hisses end groans for the Lord Lieutenant during the
</p>
<p>night ; he saw a bottle thrown ; he saw it when it struck the
</p>
<p>curtain, Mr. Barton held it up ; it struck the curtain, about three
</p>
<p>or four feet from the stage, and about two thirds from the cen-
</p>
<p>tre to the side where his Excellency sat ; it rolled from the cur-
</p>
<p>tain towards Mr. Barton, who stopped the music and held it up ;
</p>
<p>it was what is usually called a quart bottle ; when it was thrown
</p>
<p>the orchestra were playing " God save the King ;" witness ob-
</p>
<p>served papers flying about ; he observed them first coming from
</p>
<p>t \e upper gallery, and next coming from the lattices over his
</p>
<p>own head  (Here witness identified some of those papers.)
</p>
<p>When the bottle was held up there was a general expression of
</p>
<p>indignation ; some cried " shame, shame ;" witness could not
</p>
<p>say what was the object for which the bottle was thrown.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr..Scriven.
</p>
<p>In answer to a question, witness said that he believed there
</p>
<p>was a heavy weight at the bottom of the scene, and that there

</p>
<p>was a heavy stick or beam  a roller  as that was the case, the
</p>
<p>only possibility of the end of the curtain being lifted up by the
</p>
<p>bottlewhichstruck.it, depended on the force with which the
</p>
<p>bottle might have been thrown ; he did not think it would
</p>
<p>but it depended on circumstances ; he was quite sure the bottle
</p>
<p>would indent the curtain ; witness said he did not notice the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant bowing to the Lord Mavor when he came in;
</p>
<p>had no recollection that the Lord Lieutenant cheered the Lord
</p>
<p>Mayor.
</p>
<p>In answer to the Chief Justice, Mr. O'Flaherty said that he
</p>
<p>never saw the drop scene nearer than from the boxes ; has been
</p>
<p>on the stage in the clay time, but not when 4\e Drop Curtain,.
</p>

</p>
<p>Question by Mr. Justice Jebb.  Was it before the play or af-
</p>
<p>ter it, the bottle was thrown ? Previous to the commencement
</p>
<p>of the farce, while the ^orchestra was playing " God save the
</p>
<p>King."

<p>Gilts O'Brien sworn  zxamined by Mr. Green,
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre the night of the 14th December
</p>
<p>last, in the upper gallery, on the left side ; witness observed
</p>
<p>sticks and hissing in the gallery, the hissing was fo:- the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant & the Lord Mayor ; between the play and the farce
</p>
<p>he heard some cry out for " the Protestant Boys" and " the
</p>
<p>Boyne Water," and he heard some call the Lord Mayor ') a bloo-
</p>
<p>dy Papist;" he believed some called the Lord Lieutenant " a
</p>
<p>bloody Papist ;" the witness was desired not to say so unless he
</p>
<p>was sure ; he said he was quite sure that they called the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant " a bloody Papist:" he heard some say, "look out,
</p>
<p>look out," and answer " we are here;" he observed one person
</p>
<p>in particular whom he would know, with a short stick; there,
</p>
<p>were several with short sticks about half- a-yard long: could not
</p>
<p>identify any of the Traversers ; witness saw one man in the act
</p>
<p>of throwing, and be saw a thing passing down by the side of the
</p>
<p>lattices ; he did not see what it struck ; it was between the
</p>
<p>play and farce when in was thrown.

<p>John Eastham sworn examined by the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>Witness was at the Theatre on the night of the 1 1th De-
</p>
<p>cember, when the Lord Lieutenant was in it ; witness was in
</p>
<p>the upper gallery, the right-hand side ; witness saw a person
</p>
<p>striking With a stick on the front of the gallery, and calling
</p>
<p>out "no Popish Lord Lieutenant" " no Popish Governor.*
</p>
<p>The person who cried out so, was, apparently, a tall man ;
</p>
<p>he was sitting. Witness identified Henry Handwich, and
</p>
<p>saidlie never ""saw him before or since the night he was at the
</p>
<p>Iheatre ; witness has no doubt of his person ; witness did not
</p>
<p>know the man who was sitting next in the Court to Mr. Farren.
</p>
<p>(That man was Matthew Handwich.) Witness said there
</p>
<p>was a great deal of noise ; but no part of it was made by

</p>
<p>witness*; Henry Handwich joined in the groans, and he seemed
</p>
<p>to be the most conspicuous. To the- best of witness's opinion,
</p>
<p>there must have  en one hundred persons engaged m the
</p>
<p>disturbances, and belonging to that party; they had large
</p>
<p>sticks, with knobs on them ; the length of witness's arm, with
</p>
<p>knotb on them as big as witness's list ; witness was alarmed,
</p>
<p>and expressed a tfish to a friend to get out of the house; but as
</p>
<p>lie had no means of getting out, he proposed to get into the
</p>
<p>iriddle gallery ; there were persons beating behind him, but
</p>
<p>lie did not see them ; they were among the party ; they had a
</p>
<p>Word among themselves  bok out"-" look out, which
</p>
<p>thoy used frcqud ltly ; witness knew a person who was among
</p>
<p>the p.trty ; but that person was not in Court.

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arthur Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre before the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>arrived ; he sat in the second row ; he was there early, and
</p>
<p>endeavoured to get forward ; there was groaning and clapping
</p>
<p>of hands ; the groaning expressed disapprobation ; they who
</p>
<p>approved, clapped and made a noise.. When the Lord Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant came in, he was generally cheered ; it was not at that
</p>
<p>time that the witness observed Handwich hitting with a stick ;
</p>
<p>witness did not join in the noise ; witness did not join in the
</p>
<p>cheering of the Lord Lieutenant ; he did not, on any occasion ;
</p>
<p>he did not for the Lord Mayor ; he did not for the whole
</p>
<p>night ; nor hissed any body ; nor take any part whatsoever;
</p>
<p>he did not clap during the whole night. Q. Did not you clap
</p>
<p>when the Lord Lieutenant was clapped ? I did, when he
</p>
<p>came in, Q, Were you examined before the Grand Jury ?
</p>
<p>I was.

<p>Christopher Moran sworn.  Examined by the Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>Witness remembers the night the Lord Lieutenant went to
</p>
<p>the Theatre ; witness was there in the upper gallery ; wit-
</p>
<p>ness's attention was directed to a number of persons with
</p>
<p>sticks, who were hissing and groaning the Lord Lieutenant ;
</p>
<p>those persons were in the left hand side of the gallery ; there
</p>
<p>was a large party together, but witness cannot say the number
</p>
<p>of them-; he observed some persons in particular. [Here the
</p>
<p>witness identified the two Handwiches ;] he saw Matthew
</p>
<p>Handwich striking with a stick, and interrupting the perform-
</p>
<p>ance ; he heard Matthew Handwich propose to groan the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant ; he heard them cry out " a groan for Popish
</p>
<p>Welleiley, ' and " no Popish Governor ;" it was Matthew
</p>
<p>Handwich who cried that ; he saw no weapons but sticks with
</p>
<p>them ; he saw one person with a rattle ringing it ; he doeTnot
</p>
<p>think he would know that person again ; he saw no stick with
</p>
<p>Henry Handwich, but with Matthew Handwich : he saw
</p>
<p>other sticks there ; there were persons beat that night ; he

<p>saw Henry Hand vich behind him, in a party who had a man
</p>
<p>down, and they were waiting till he would rise in order to beat
</p>
<p>him : he observed a fight in the left corner, but he can't tell
</p>
<p>who they were who were fighting.. %
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. D?-iscolL
</p>
<p>What are you ? A painter. Oh L I perceive so  you saw
</p>
<p>no bottle thrown? No* You were observing the two men
</p>
<p>shouting ? There were other men shouting, but I observed
</p>
<p>those two men, in particular, shouting ; witness was with
</p>
<p>those two persons at the door, and went up to the gallery
</p>
<p>with them ; but witness stopt to buy a ticket in the passage ;
</p>
<p>they went up without buying any ; witness did not see tickets
</p>
<p>with them ; witness was with those two persons at the door;
</p>
<p>they were particular persons in their appearance, and witness
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>observed them ; witness sat in the centre of the gallery, but
</p>
<p>the two persons, the Handwicbes, were about midway be-
</p>
<p>tween the left hand wall and the centre ; the first time the
</p>
<p>witness saw the bottle was when it was in the fist of the musi-
</p>
<p>cian : witness saw a stick in the hand of Matthew ; but he
</p>
<p>does not know whether Henry had a stick or not. A dusky
</p>
<p>light reaches that gallery ? It is a very good light. Is it not
</p>
<p>rather dusky in comparason to the rest of the house ? It is,
</p>
<p>Suppose that you were in the part of the lattices, as a Gen-
</p>
<p>tleman like you ought to be, ought not you to be able to distin-
</p>
<p>guish a person by the light? What light ? Will you swear
</p>
<p>there is no light at the lattices ? I do not know whether there
</p>
<p>is or not. Were you jjoften in the Theatre ? I can't swear
</p>
<p>whether there are any lights near the lattices. You won't
</p>
<p>swear that there are lights near the lattices ? I could not
</p>
<p>swear. Is this the first time you have been examined on the
</p>
<p>subject ? I was examined at the police-office ; I was exami-
</p>
<p>ned by Mr. Gabbed, and by the Grand Jury. Now, by the
</p>
<p>virtue of your oath, when I asked you whether you had been.
</p>
<p>examined before, did you think I meant the Grand Jury ?
</p>
<p>I was before the Grand Jury for two or three minutes ; they
</p>
<p>a^ked me did I see the man throw the bottle? I said no.
</p>
<p>They asked did I see the man throw the stick ? I said no 
</p>
<p>I was going to explain what I did see, but they told me that
</p>
<p>was enough, and showed me out.
</p>
<p>(A strong sensation was manifested in every part of the
</p>
<p>Court at the declaration thus made by the witness.)
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Speer.
</p>
<p>Have you oeen in the upper ( gallery before that night ? Yes.
</p>
<p>When the Lord Lieutenant is expected to go to the Theatre,
</p>
<p>is not the house generally crowded ? Yes. Was it a full house
</p>
<p>when you were there? Yes. It is not an unusual thing to see
</p>
<p>a boxing, or a fighting match in the upper gallery ? No
</p>
<p>You say you saw Henry Handwich, and that he was enga^c-d in

</p>
<p>a boxing match with some person ; did not that person know
</p>
<p>him ? I don't know. You said that he had no stick in his
</p>
<p>band ? I said I would not swear that he had a stick. Did you
</p>
<p>ever see a stick in the upper gallery before ? I don't think
</p>
<p>I ever did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Michael Farre.l, sveorn.
</p>
<p>Were you in the Theatre on the night the Lord Litutenant
</p>
<p>was there ? I was. Look at that part of the Court and tell
</p>
<p>me whether you know the name of any person there who was at
</p>
<p>the Theatre on that night ? I saw Henry Handwich there. In
</p>
<p>what part of the house? In the upper gallery. How near
</p>
<p>were you to him. At different parts of the evening, I was
</p>
<p>sometimes nearer to him than at others ; he moved about. 
</p>
<p>you ? No, but at one time there was a disturbance, and
</p>
<p>ss
</p>
<p>I moved. How distant were you from him? There were
</p>
<p>about two between us ; in point of fact there was but one> but
</p>
<p>there might be two between us. Did you observe Handwich
</p>
<p>doing any tiling ? I did What was it ? After the hst act of
</p>
<p>the comedy was over  after the Play was over, there was a
</p>
<p>noise in the house ; I saw Handwich take a bottle and throw it
</p>
<p>from him. Was there any noise then ? There was hooting
</p>
<p>and noise. What kind of noise ? There was a groan for
</p>
<p>Wellesley, but I did not mind it much. How far was Hand*
</p>
<p>wich distant then from you ? He was distant as far as that
</p>
<p>Gentleman is. (Here the witness pointed to a Gentleman who
</p>
<p>was distant about a yard from the witness.  How did he throw
</p>
<p>the bottle ? He flung it in a half round, with a sweep, under
</p>
<p>his arm ; I don't know whether I am correct in the expression
</p>
<p>I use; he flung it this way. (Here the witness showed the
</p>
<p>manner by moving his arm.)  Could you judge at what part of
</p>
<p>the house it would get? As far as I can judge it would go to
</p>
<p>the left hand part of the house. Did you see any thing of it
</p>
<p>afterwards ? I did ; they were standing in the seat before me
</p>
<p>and it was only now and then that I could perceive the stage ;
</p>
<p>after the bottle was thrown, I saw it held up by one of the
</p>
<p>musicians. Had Handwich any company with him? There
</p>
<p>was a numberof persons together with him. Did you observe any
</p>
<p>thing they were doing ? They were nois)', with sticks in their
</p>
<p>hanus. What kind of sticks ? White sticks, with large lumps at
</p>
<p>the end and about half a yard long. What did you seeHandwich
</p>
<p>doing when he was among those persons ? He was in conver-
</p>
<p>sation with them. What was their conduct 9 It was riotous.
</p>
<p>They were calling names, but I did not take any particular
</p>
<p>notice of them. What were the names $ A hoot for Wellesley &
</p>
<p>Eastern Tyrants. Did you take any notice of Handwich then ?
</p>
<p>I did not take any particular notice except that he was rioting
</p>
<p>with others. How soon was Handwich arrested that night ?
</p>
<p>Just as the curtain drew up, just as the afterpiece began. Did he

</p>
<p>move from the place where he threw the bottle, in the inter-
</p>
<p>mediate time ? He did not. Did you lose sight of him f
</p>
<p>Never. (This answer of the witness was pronounced with
</p>
<p>great solemnity.) I never did. When they came to arrest
</p>
<p>him was there not some confusion ? There was. How did it
</p>
<p>happen that you never lost sight of him ? Because I was
</p>
<p>determined never to lose sight of him till I should have him in
</p>
<p>custody ; I followed him down the street, and went with him
</p>
<p>into the police-office and staid there till I [was put out, when I ;
</p>
<p>told them that I knew something of the matter. What hour
</p>
<p>was it then ? It w T as about half past eleven when I was put out
</p>
<p>of the police-office. How did that take place? I followed
</p>
<p>him into the board-room, and I told the officer " I know more
</p>
<p>of this than you are aware of," and he then turned me out. 
</p>
<p>Did you ever know Handwich before? I never saw Hind-
</p>
<p>v. jch before ; I was born in this Country, but I lived in London
</p>
<p>from the age of two or three years old. What is your
</p>
<p>business? A working Jeweller.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Blackburn.
</p>
<p>Have you any interest in this trial ? Xone in the least.
</p>
<p>You made two attempts to give your informations  tell me
</p>
<p>when they were  the first, I believe, was on Saturday night 
</p>
<p>was it not? It was. And the second was on Sunday  was
</p>
<p>it not? It was. Did you go anytime else to give informa-
</p>
<p>tions? I went to the Castie. Oh, then, instead of twice,
</p>
<p>you attempted to give informations three times ; is that the
</p>
<p>case?
</p>
<p>Here the Courr interfered, and said, that the witness did not
</p>
<p>understand Mr. Blackburne, in consequence of Mr. Blackburne
</p>
<p>having used the word " information' in a technical sense, and
</p>
<p>the witness having understood it in its colloquial acceptation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Farrell was desired to explain what he understood
</p>
<p>by the word information ; and when Mr. Farrell told what he
</p>
<p>understood by the word, it appeared that the court was right
</p>
<p>in its opinion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Blackburne asked the witness whether he had been exa-
</p>
<p>mined before the Grand Jury ? witness said that he had ; wit-
</p>
<p>ness was then asked whether he disclosed to any person the ex-
</p>
<p>amination which had taken place before the Grand Jury  He
</p>
<p>said that he told what had been asked to several persons  to a
</p>
<p>Mr. Hill, and to a Mr. Gordon, and to several others. He was
</p>
<p>then asked, whether he knew how it happened that an account
</p>
<p>of several parts of his examination before the Grand Jury ap-
</p>
<p>peared in the Courier Newspaper, of the 4th of January last ;
</p>
<p>witness said that he believed Mr. Gordon sent to the Courier
</p>
<p>Newspaper that account, as he had asked witness to state the
</p>
<p>particulars, and that witness did so in a desultory manner, im-
</p>
<p>mediately after his return from the Grand Jury Room. So you
</p>
<p>went to him to get the particulars inserted in the Courier ? I

<p>did not  he came to me. How did you get acquainted with
</p>
<p>him ? I had the pleasure of knowing him several years ago in
</p>
<p>London. But you gave it to a Reporter ? I did not  he was
</p>
<p>then the Editor of the Correspondent Newspaper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Blackburne read a part of the account which appeared
</p>
<p>in the Courier^ and asked the witness if it was true, as the
</p>
<p>statement in the Courier declared that he had said before the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury that Flandwich had flung the bottle with an exten-
</p>
<p>ded arm. The witness said that the account was so far true, and
</p>
<p>he described the manner in which it was thrown by extending
</p>
<p>his arm.
</p>
<p>Mr. Blackburne. And do you call that an extended arm ?
</p>
<p>Witness. I do.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General. And what else would you call it?

</p>
<p>Q. What Magistrate did you see when you went to the police-
</p>
<p>office ? There was none. Did you see no officer?' I did, and I
</p>
<p>told him that I knew more of it than he knew before he turned
</p>
<p>me out? Djyou swear he tamed you out? He did not deny it
</p>
<p>himself. Upon your oath, after you came out did you say
</p>
<p>that you had been sworn, and that you bad done his business
</p>
<p>for him? Never, (with great emphasis) Did you say so on
</p>
<p>Sunday morning ? So. Did you say on Sunday morning any
</p>
<p>thing of what had passed, to anybody ? I did not. Did you
</p>
<p>.say that you were glad to be revenged of the Orangemen ? I
</p>
<p>never did, ( with a solemn emphasis.) Did you say that you
</p>
<p>would be revenged, or any word, or words to that effect? Ne-
</p>
<p>ver, {with a solemn emphasis. ) I did net, (with emphasis).
</p>
<p>Did jbvl walk through the crowd, and say any thing ? I saw-
</p>
<p>no crowd ; I saw only two men that I took notice of. You said
</p>
<p>nothing when you were near the two men : do you swear thai? I
</p>
<p>swear that. I said nothing derogatory to the character of Orange-
</p>
<p>men. Where did you go then after leaving the police-office ? I
</p>
<p>went to Mrs. Booth's, in Exchequer-street. T Exchequer-
</p>
<p>street ? No, I have made a mistake ; I went to Mr. Hill's, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Booth's son-in-law, in the North-strand. When did you go
</p>
<p>home? I did not go home until after I went to the North-strand.
</p>
<p>  Did you say that you were glaa that you had sworn against
</p>
<p>Handwich; I ask you, Sir, on the oath you have taken ? I ne-
</p>
<p>ver said so  (with great solemnity )  never (with great empha-
</p>
<p>sis) from the time I left the office up to this moment. Who
</p>
<p>was with you when you left the police-office, and where did
</p>
<p>you o;o ? From the office I went with Mr. Hill to his house in
</p>
<p>the North- strand? Did you say any thing on thesubject to him?
</p>
<p>He had heard what had passed, and I only said to him that it
</p>
<p>was onlv a duty which J owed to the public to come forward.
</p>
<p>You swore that you did' not say that you would be revenged of

</p>
<p>the bloody Orangeman or Orangemen ; or utter any word to that
</p>
<p>e jfect? I swore I did not say so.  Was there any other person
</p>
<p>with you ? Nobody but Mr. Hill. Did you not say something
</p>
<p>to Mr. Hill derogatory to the Orangemen ? I did not. Did
</p>
<p>you stop at any place ? We made no stand.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Driscoll.
</p>
<p>Did you ever preach to any religious congregation. (A
</p>
<p>laugh.) Never.
</p>
<p>Tie hief Justice asked what was that, as he could not hear
</p>
<p>the answer, on account of the laughing in the Court. The
</p>
<p>answer was repeated, and his Lordship noted it down.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. borth.
</p>
<p>Yru were examined before the Grand Jury, and you gave
</p>
<p>an account of it to Mr. Gordon j am I to understand from
</p>
<p>it
</p>
<p>you, that as far as you entered into that account it was cor-
</p>
<p>rect ; I mean as Tar as you entered into the account which
</p>
<p>yuu gave to Mr. Gordon ? I told him as near as I could the
</p>
<p>particulars at the time he was with me. I rake it for granted,
</p>
<p>that you told the truth to the Grand Jury, and that i:i this,
</p>
<p>account which you gave to Mr. Gordon, as a representation
</p>
<p>of what had occurred in the Grand Jury-room ; you were as
</p>
<p>particular as you were in the Grand Jury-room f I was not
</p>
<p>so particular to Mr. Gordon as I would be before the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury. As that was only a short time after, and your recoiSec-
</p>
<p>tion must have been as good then as before? I told nothing
</p>
<p>but the truth ; I recollect the facts now as well as A then.
</p>
<p>Did you in representing those facts to Mr. Gordon, tell him
</p>
<p>that it was on the left side, as stated in the Courier newspa-
</p>
<p>per ? Whatever I said to Mr. Gordon, which was but very
</p>
<p>short, and in a hurried meaner, I told him the truth. Did
</p>
<p>that statement about V the left side," enter into your repre-
</p>
<p>sentation of the fact ? I have no recollection now, of what
</p>
<p>I told Mr. Gordon then but I told him in a hayfy manner
</p>
<p>nothing but what was true. Did Mr. Gordon ask you any
</p>
<p>question of what you had seen in the Theatre? He did not.
</p>
<p>So then he had not the curiosity of asking you any question
</p>
<p>on the subject ? He asked me what I had been asked in the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury-room, and I gave him a short account of it.
</p>
<p>Would not a man of your size strike the dip of the gallery if
</p>
<p>you stood up ? I can't well say how high the dip is. Is it
</p>
<p>six feet  is it five feel ? I don't exactly know, but I believe it
</p>
<p>is about the height of a man standing. If that is the fact,
</p>
<p>how could he have thrown a bottle ? Very easily, for in the
</p>
<p>way in which the bottle was thrown, he could not touch the
</p>
<p>dip. If he threw a bottle in a slanting manner, would he not
</p>
<p>hit the cornice  it he threw it perpendicularly over his head,
</p>
<p>would he not have struck the dip, and if he threw it with a
</p>
<p>jerk, underneath, must he not have hit the seat ? He took

<p>the botile, and he sent it neither up nor under, but in this
</p>
<p>manner  ( 4ere the witness, by a motion of his arm, showtd
</p>
<p>the manner in which the bottle was flung.)
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Le/roy.
</p>
<p>There were no persons crowded towards the centre at the
</p>
<p>time ; is that the fact V There were more persons in the centre
</p>
<p>than in the other pares of the house; where Hundwich stood
</p>
<p>when he threw the bottle, was less in the observation of the
</p>
<p>hou>-e than in the centre.
</p>
<p>Mr. Philip P. Ryan, svoorn  examined by Mr. Serjeant
</p>
<p>Torrens.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre the night of the outrage ; witness
</p>
<p>identified George Graham ; when Graham was made a prisoner,
</p>
<p>fee gave his nanae as George Graham j Graham was sitting in,
</p>
<p>4?
</p>
<p>the front seat in the upper gallery ; witness took notice of hirn
</p>
<p>from the noise he made many times with a rattle which he had
</p>
<p>in his hand during the play ; at the conclusion of the play he
</p>
<p>made noise; witness did not hear him after; witness saw Gra-
</p>
<p>ham striking with both the pieces of the wood ; witness saw
</p>
<p>Graham raise his hand, some time about the singing of the
</p>
<p>glee, when the Lord Lieutenant was groaned and hissed; he
</p>
<p>stoA up, looked into the middle gallery, and then he threw
</p>
<p>the piece ?of the rattle he had in his hand, in the direction
</p>
<p>where the Lord Lieutenant was sitting; it appeared to witness
</p>
<p>to strike the edge of the seat of the box in which the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant was sitting ; witness was in the middle gallery, and
</p>
<p>Graham was in the front seat of the upper gallery ; he could
</p>
<p>see Graham distinctly ; he heard words uttered ; to the best
</p>
<p>of his recollection, such as " Xo Popish Governor."  u A
</p>
<p>groan for Wellesley ;" he recollects other expressions ; some
</p>
<p>were drinking liquor, and gave " The Glorious, Pious, and
</p>
<p>Immortal Memory;" " The Boyne Water;'* " The Protestant
</p>
<p>Ascendancy;" some cried out these words, "this night, boys,
</p>
<p>the gallery is our own ;" witness saw some persons in the up-
</p>
<p>per gallery with large white sticks ; witness was examined be-
</p>
<p>fore the Grand Jury in Green-street, and gave the same testi-
</p>
<p>mony, or what was tantamount to it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mt . Hamilton,
</p>
<p>Witness was in the fourth or fifth seat of the middle gallery ;
</p>
<p>lie gave his informations at the police-office, on the following
</p>
<p>morning ; he spoke then with equal certainty, and in distinct
</p>
<p>terms ; he said that he recognized the man in the watch-house ;
</p>
<p>before witness saw the prisoner he gave a description of the
</p>
<p>prisoner to a man who appeared to be a constable in the watch-
</p>
<p>house ; he asked in the watch-house if there was a prisoner
</p>
<p>there with a sallow complexion, and a dark-coloured, or
</p>
<p>dark -mixture coat ; witness said it was a large outside coat,
</p>
<p>but cannot recollect ; witness is in the Excise department,

<p>and stationed in the County Galway ; he is a Preventive
</p>
<p>Officer of Excise; some persons in similar situations have a
</p>
<p>wetk'y a'lowance to their commissions, bat witness has none ;
</p>
<p>witness is not looking for promotion, but has leome to town for
</p>
<p>some reward that is due to him ; he got part of it, and has an
</p>
<p>expectation of getting the ballance ; the reason why he did
</p>
<p>not get all, was this  there is a regulation in the board, that
</p>
<p>no person in the situation which witness holds, shall act with-
</p>
<p>out the presence of the local officer ; and as witness made a
</p>
<p>seizure without the presence of the local officer, he was not
</p>
<p>entitled to the reward. The case was referred to the Inspec-
</p>
<p>tor General, and witness was told that the report of the In-
</p>
<p>spector-General was, that it- should be better- if witness had
</p>
<p>acted with the local officer. It was afterwards referred to
</p>
<p>Mr. Swift, but Mr, Swift has cot as yet reported on the ease.
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>The sum of money then which you are looking for, hfcs not
</p>
<p>been granted ? No, not as yet, but I expect it, as I zealously
</p>
<p>performed my duty.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justices  Unless you can bring it to a point, it
</p>
<p>seems to me that as far as the witness has gone as yet, that he
</p>
<p>has explained the transaction most satisfactorily.
</p>
<p>Upon the claim were you examined upon oath ? There
</p>
<p>was no occasion. That is no answer. I was sworn; 1 am
</p>
<p>looking for the remainder *>f the reward, if it meets the ap-
</p>
<p>probation of the Board.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bernard M'Namara stvorti*
</p>
<p>Q. What profession are you ? Doctor of Physic. Witness
</p>
<p>lives at Balliuakill, in the Queen's County ; witness was in
</p>
<p>town the night the Lord Lieutenant went to the Theatre ;
</p>
<p>witness was in the middle gallery ; recollects a good deal of
</p>
<p>the disturbances in the house on that night* The persons ia
</p>
<p>upper gallery uttered several offensive, gross, and scurrilous
</p>
<p>expressions against the Lord Mayor they called him " the
</p>
<p>Knave of Clubs." (A laugh.) " No Popish guards in Col-
</p>
<p>lege-green." (A laugh.) They afterwards uttered other
</p>
<p>words, such as-, a clap for Lord Talbot, a clap for Lord
</p>
<p>J> Neil, and a clap for Alderman Darley. They cried out no
</p>
<p>Popish Governor; witness observed something about a bottles
</p>
<p>he heard a boy's voice calling out " boy's mind your fire ;'*
</p>
<p>witness got alarmed and stood up; witness looked to the
</p>
<p>upper gallery, at the extremity of which the witness saw a
</p>
<p>man wind his arm, out-top the persons in the front seat,
</p>
<p>and fling something from him ; witness watched it in its
</p>
<p>transit ; when it passed the orchestra, some persons in the
</p>
<p>front seats started up ; when they stood up they intercepted
</p>
<p>the view, and' witness lost sight of it. There was then a cry
</p>
<p>of down in the front; when the person sat down witness saw
</p>
<p>the bottle when it was taken up by the musician. (Here wit-
</p>
<p>ness identified Henry Handwich, and declared that he had

<p>never seen the traverser from that night till witness came into
</p>
<p>Court this day ;) witness has no doubt about Handwich, if he
</p>
<p>can believe the evidence of his senses.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scriven.
</p>
<p>Did you hear any other words ? I did. In the scene of
</p>
<p>Toney Lumpkin at the table, some body called out to Lislon,
</p>
<p>to drink " The Glorious, Pious and Immortal Memory."
</p>
<p>(a laugh)  You said that all the expressions were scurrilous
</p>
<p>and offensive ? did not you say that they were all scurrilous
</p>
<p>and offensive expressions to the Lord Mayor? Is a clap. for
</p>
<p>Lord O'Neil a scurrilous expression to the Lord Mayor?
</p>
<p>(a laugh.) Is a clap for Alderman Darley a scurrilous expres-
</p>
<p>sion to the Lord Mayor ? (a laugh )
</p>
<p>By the Court. That is a mistake .of yours the man said
</p>
<p>no such thing. e
</p>
<p>*4
</p>
<p>Mr, Scrlven repeated his assertion.
</p>
<p>Court  Nothing like that was said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Jebb read his notes.
</p>
<p>Cross-examination resumed.
</p>
<p>Witness admitted that he had been put in confinement for
</p>
<p>an alleged breach of pound ; witness did not break open the
</p>
<p>pound ; there was a man with witness who opened the pound
</p>
<p>gate, which was hanging on one hinge  (a laugh) and he
</p>
<p>took it up and drove out tlje cattle. ( Heie witness wished to
</p>
<p>explain the nature of the transaction, but the Counsel for the
</p>
<p>Traversers would not let him.) Witness did not break open
</p>
<p>the pound ; witness did not indict a man for it ; but a man
</p>
<p>indicted witness. There was cross indictments : The man
</p>
<p>whom witness indicted was acquitted, and witness was sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to three months imprisonment, with a fine of %Q*
</p>
<p>Witness said that he had only taken out of the pound some
</p>
<p>cattle which he had sent there as a distress for rent, and he
</p>
<p>endeavoured to state the particulars, but he was prevented
</p>
<p>from doing so by the Counsel. He said, however, that he
</p>
<p>had offered three times the value of the cattle, as a security,
</p>
<p>to the pound-keeper, before he took them out of the pound.
</p>
<p>Witness said that he had dined with a friend in Mountjoy-
</p>
<p>square, and he described to him what had occurred at the
</p>
<p>Theatre. The witness could not otherwise explain why he
</p>
<p>was summoned as a witness, as he could not trace it to any
</p>
<p>other source.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Speer.
</p>
<p>Did any body point out this day any person in the Court as
</p>
<p>Handwich ? No body ; I knew him in the morning when I
</p>
<p>saw him ; I was standing for a few minutes near the Crier of
</p>
<p>the Court ; I never saw Handwich since I saw him in the
</p>
<p>Theatre, but I knew him the moment I cast my eye on him ;
</p>
<p>witness said that he thought that Handwich had been en the
</p>
<p>second bench in the upper gallery ; witness was in the middle

<p>gallery; witness said, I observed him particularly, because
</p>
<p>his face and figure were remarkable.
</p>
<p>Question by the Court*  You came into Court at the close
</p>
<p>of Farrell's examination? I was not here when Farrell had re-
</p>
<p>cognized him ; I was only a short time in Court ; I was near
</p>
<p>the Crier, and nobody was with me.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. North.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the middle gallery ; can't say exactly on
</p>
<p>what bench he sat, but his situation commanded a perfect
</p>
<p>Tiew ; the man whom witness indentified was about the third
</p>
<p>row of the ga'lery ; witness turned about when he heard the
</p>
<p>boy say, {t mind your fire ;" that expression excited his atten-
</p>
<p>tion ; he became alarmed, and he turned about ; there was a
</p>
<p>man standing with two ladies, who retired then from the
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>gallery ; when witness heard the words, " mind your fire,
</p>
<p>he did not make any observation to any person near him. You
</p>
<p>said that you intended to memorial the Government about
</p>
<p>your confinement, but that you changed your mind ; tell me,
</p>
<p>Doctor, will you say that you are not influenced in giving
</p>
<p>your testimony by such a consideration ? As I hope for sal-
</p>
<p>vation, I have no such motive; I am brought up here in cus-
</p>
<p>tody ; witness said, that during the examination of Farrell
</p>
<p>he was outside the door of the Court, so that he could see
</p>
<p>but indistinctly the witness on the table ; witness was a quar-
</p>
<p>ter of an hour in the Court, but nothing was then doing ; it
</p>
<p>was then but nine o'clock. Where were you afterwards ? I
</p>
<p>was at my breakfast. Do you know Henry Arabin  perhaps
</p>
<p>you do not wish to know him ? i do not. He pronounced
</p>
<p>those little things we call a sentence  was he not rather se-
</p>
<p>vere ? No answer.
</p>
<p>THIRD DAY Wednesday, Feb. 5.
</p>
<p>This morning, the Chief Justice, Judge Jebb, Judge Bur-,
</p>
<p>ton, and Judge Vandaleur, took their seats on the Bench a few
</p>
<p>minutes after nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>The names of the Gentlemen of the Jury were then called
</p>
<p>over, to which they severally replied.
</p>
<p>The Traversers were then severally called, and having an-
</p>
<p>swered to their names, the examination of evidence was re-,
</p>
<p>sumed.
</p>
<p>James Tier nan  examined by Mr. J. S. Townsend.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre on the night the Lord Lieut, was
</p>
<p>there ; was in the upper gallery ; sat in the second seat ; from
</p>
<p>the conduct of a person who sat before witness ; (he witness)
</p>
<p>observed him particularly ; that person's name is George Gra_
</p>
<p>ham, he kept ringing a rattle and making a great noise ; he sat
</p>
<p>more to the left of the gallery than the centre; there was a great
</p>
<p>deal of noise and disturbance in the house throughout the night,
</p>
<p>but they had the most of the noise in the upper gallery-? [much

<p>laughter]; witness heard the Lord Mayor groaned, and his Ex-
</p>
<p>cellency was groaned: heard " a clap for the Calf's Head ;" there
</p>
<p>was a bottle thrown ; it came from behind witness ; can't say
</p>
<p>who threw it ; saw it go over his head and strike the curtain,
</p>
<p>saw the head of the rattle thrown, it was the part that turns
</p>
<p>round, this was thrown the time the farce of Tom Thumb, \m
</p>
<p>going on, it dropped at the foot of his Excellency's box,: saw
</p>
<p>Mr. Barton take up a bottle when the rattle was thrown ; wit-
</p>
<p>nesss cried out ". shame, - shame," and he was struck with a
</p>
<p>bludgeon from behind ; he received a second blow, and is black
</p>
<p>still where he was struck, witness thinks the bludgeons they had
</p>
<p>were made for the purpose ; saw the person who threw the rat-
</p>
<p>tle taken into custody, never lost sight of him until he saw hiai
</p>
<p>taken.
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Driscofl.
</p>
<p>Witness is in the chandling business ; saw the bottle in pas-
</p>
<p>fling over his head ; has no object in view in giving his evidence,
</p>
<p>witness did not see who struck him, when he got the first blow
</p>
<p>on the shoulder, he received another there, (putting his hand
</p>
<p>n his thigh) he then .sat down and took what he got- a laugh ;
</p>
<p>there were four corners on the stick, it was as sharp as a lance, ,
</p>
<p>witness felt it more than he ever felt any lance, was never bled
</p>
<p>by a lance in his life  (great laughter) ; witness gave informati-
</p>
<p>on on the 26th of December, was afraid to give evidence before,
</p>
<p>when he saw how it was taken up by the country at large, he
</p>
<p>took a little courage, he was afraid of being pelted in the|streets,
</p>
<p>thinks the country at large would prevent his getting a clink atV
</p>
<p>the corner of a lane : told Mr. Galogiy (a peace officer,) what he .
</p>
<p>could tell on Christmas eve ; Major rfirr wrote to him on Christ-
</p>
<p>mas d^y, desiring him to attend the next day ; ^saw the bottle
</p>
<p>strike the centre of the curtain.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scriven.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the upper gallery on that night ; there was a
</p>
<p>great crowd ; witness was nearer the left side; often looked
</p>
<p>about ; saw an immense great crowd ; never saw the upper gal-
</p>
<p>lery so crowded ; th,e whole way to the back was crowded ; it
</p>
<p>appeared as if it was packed ; did not see an empty seat ; there
</p>
<p>was suci a noise round him his ears were bothered/ he
</p>
<p>did not hear three words of the play ; some of the noise might
</p>
<p>have came from his (witness) own mouth ; he did not groan or
</p>
<p>hiss ; he clapped his hands ; that was not with his mouth ; he
</p>
<p>did not hiss when the Boyne Water or the Protestant Boys was
</p>
<p>called for ; a smothered sigh might have escaped him ; did not
</p>
<p>hiss Lord O'Neill, nor clap him; does not like him ; he (Lord
</p>
<p>O'Neill) never injured witness, nor would he (witness) know
</p>
<p>him, but he heard he was Grand Master of an Orange Lodge ;
</p>
<p>did not hear Sheriff Thorpe groaned, but he was often clapped.

<p>not hear an)' one call out, " mind your fire," nor any words
</p>
<p>called out that he would consider as watch-words.

<p>Thos. Staunton CaJiill, cross-examined by the Solicitor General'
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre on the night of his Excellency's
</p>
<p>visit ; was jjn the lower gallery; saw something pass through
</p>
<p>the air that night ; saw that it was a bottle ; saw it in its pas-
</p>
<p>sage over the pit to the stage ; it appeared to have come from
</p>
<p>behind witness, and from an upper part of the house, by the
</p>
<p>direction it took.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. JDriscolh
</p>
<p>Witness is in College, as a Medical Student ; when he saw
</p>
<p>the bottle moving over the pit, it was going very quickly ;
</p>
<p>whit drew witness's attention to it, was, he heard a man in the
</p>
<p>upper gallery ealling out, " Ah, ha, Wellesley/' on turning
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>round and looking up, he saw a man drinking out of a bottle,
</p>
<p>which he handed round to some persons near him ; some person
</p>
<p>in the immediate vicinity of this man threw down a card to
</p>
<p>witness and desired him to take it up and read it ; witness took
</p>
<p>up this paper and read the words no popeuy ; it was a printed
</p>
<p>label; on perceiving this, witness again raised up his head;
</p>
<p>and then it was, that he saw the bottle in its progress ; can't say
</p>
<p>who threw it ; don't know who the man was that desired witness
</p>
<p>to read th*. printed label : witness afterwards told what he knew
</p>
<p>of the circumstance to the Right Hon. the Attorney- General ;
</p>
<p>witness did not think his evidence would be material, as he did
</p>
<p>not see who threw the bottle, or could not say at whom it was
</p>
<p>thrown ; he happened to mention it at a house where he dined,
</p>
<p>and a gentleman there said that his evidence might be of service
</p>
<p>in consequence of which he told the Right Hon. Gentleman.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Perrin.
</p>
<p>Saw some persons in the gallery,drinking porter, or something
</p>
<p>like it, out of a bottle ; can't swear if the liquor w T as of a dark
</p>
<p>colour ; don't recollect ii' the performance was going on at the
</p>
<p>time ; observed the bottle passing across the pit ; it had reached
</p>
<p>aborat the centre of the pit when the bottle caught his eye in its
</p>
<p>progress by the centre of the pit ; witness does not mean mid-
</p>
<p>way between the side boxes, for it was much nearer the boxes
</p>
<p>at the left side of the house; by the centre of the pit, witness
</p>
<p>means mid-way from the gallery to the stage 5 can't say where
</p>
<p>it struck, as some person stood up at that moment before witness;
</p>
<p>in its progress it took neither a horizontal nor a perpendicular
</p>
<p>direction ; it was going obliquely, and was descending rapidly ;
</p>
<p>it did not seem to be turning over and over, but was going in a
</p>
<p>direct position.

<p>John Crosby Greaves, Police Magistrate, examined by the
</p>
<p>Attorney- General.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre, on duty, on the night Ld. Lieut,
</p>
<p>was there ; saw Forbes there that night ; witness was in the

<p>Theatre at the time the bottle was held up ; he was then in the
</p>
<p>back part of the box, next to that in which the Lord Lieute-
</p>
<p>nant sat ; after the bottle had been held up, witness saw For-
</p>
<p>bes ; when he first saw him that night, he (witness) was in the
</p>
<p>third tier of lattices, at the side of the house opposite to that at
</p>
<p>which the Lord Lieutenant sat ; witness had heard a cry of
</p>
<p>" shame" " shame," and thinking there was something wrong
</p>
<p>that called for the intervention of a Magistrate, he went to the
</p>
<p>upper boxes in order to take a survey of the house ; he then
</p>
<p>saw Forbes immediately close to the spikes of the upper pigeon-
</p>
<p>holes, at the Lord Lieutenant's side of the house, and imme-
</p>
<p>diately adjoining the gallery, a great deal of confusion and tu-
</p>
<p>mult prevailed in that part of the gallery : there were three
</p>
<p>persons in the pigeon-holes, close to the gallery, who were all
</p>
<p>using whistles ; witness seeing them with their bands up to thejr
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>mouths, crossed the house and got immediately under them ;
</p>
<p>he then looked up and saw Forbes still in the act of using the
</p>
<p>whistle ; there was nothing between the persons in the upper
</p>
<p>pigeon-holes, and those in the gallery, to prevent a commu-
</p>
<p>nication between them ; when witness was under Forbes, and
</p>
<p>saw hirn still using the whistle, he looked up to him and said,
</p>
<p>" why do you do that, Sir ?" or c * for what do you do that V his
</p>
<p>answer was " for fun ;" this was after the cries of " shame/*
</p>
<p>" shame;'' the three persons who were in the lattices had their
</p>
<p>faces directed towards the gaUery, but witness saw no precise
</p>
<p>tfommimication between them and the persons in the gallery ;
</p>
<p>Forbes persevered in using the w r histle, and witness went to
</p>
<p>take him into custody ; Mr. Tudor went for the saiiie purpose,
</p>
<p>and was before witness ; Forbes recognised Mr. Tudor as a
</p>
<p>Magistrate, and consented to go with him ; he kept one of his
</p>
<p>hands shut, and on being required to open it, did so with some
</p>
<p>reluctance ; in it was found that whistle.
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Greaves produced a small whistle, which Mr. Dris-
</p>
<p>eoll asked permission to see ; whilst this gentleman was examin-
</p>
<p>ing it, the Attorney -General said to him "I shall give directions
</p>
<p>to have it sent home to you, Mr. Driscoll, as soon as the trial
</p>
<p>is over." (Great laughter.)
</p>
<p>Examination of Mr. Greaves by the Attorney -General resumed.
</p>
<p>Forbes, on his way to the watch-house, said to witness, " Mr.
</p>
<p>Greaves I am as loyal a man as any in the community, and as
</p>
<p>much attached to the King."
</p>
<p>Witness replied that he did not want to question his loj'alty,
</p>
<p>but that lie certainly chose an awkward mode of shewing it, by
</p>
<p>disturbing the house, and insulting the King's Representative;
</p>
<p>on being asked if bail would be taken, witness said that bail might
</p>
<p>be taken for Forbes after the play was over ; Forbes said, if you
</p>
<p>will let me be discharged now, I give vou my honor I will not
</p>
<p>return to the Theatre ; Mr. Tudor seemed to wish this, and
</p>
<p>witness agreed to it on his (Mr Forbes's) promise f perfecting

</p>
<p>the bail; witness did not know of his own knowledge who had
</p>
<p>offered to go bail for Handwich on that night.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Johnson.
</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes did not know witness was a Magistrate at the
</p>
<p>time; he (witness) asked him (Forbes) " why did he whistle?
</p>
<p>and he said, " for fun ; witness believes there were fifty of the
</p>
<p>police in the Theatre on that night ; the Magistrates left those
</p>
<p>details to an Officer in whom they had great confidence, Mr.
</p>
<p>Farreli ; the directions given were, that the police should go to
</p>
<p>the Theatre in their own clothes, so as to appear like the rest
</p>
<p>of the audience ; when Mr. Forbes recognised Mr. Tudor, he
</p>
<p>told him he would go with him : he seemed anxious to explain
</p>
<p>his conduct on his passage to the watch house ; witness has no
</p>
<p>reason to suppose that he did not keep his word, or that he re-
</p>
<p>turned to the Theatre that night; when witness went to the
</p>
<p>-iidc latticed to take a view oi the upper gallery, it seemed to
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>him as if there was not a great press there, but rather as if peo-
</p>
<p>ple were leaving it ; he should suppose the rattle was thrown
</p>
<p>when he (witness) was out of the house : from the situation he
</p>
<p>was in, in the house, which was at the back of the box adjoin-
</p>
<p>ing that in which the Lord Lieutenant sat, he did not hear the
</p>
<p>noise of the rattle ; there was a great deal of confusion in the
</p>
<p>house, and it might have occurred, but it did not strike witness's
</p>
<p>ear ; there were informations taken at witness's office against
</p>
<p>Forbes ; Mr. Farley's depositions were taken down in the of-
</p>
<p>fice, and the waiters and servants of Flanagan's in Essex-street.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General here suggested to the Court, that this
</p>
<p>course of cross-examination should not be persevered in ; the
</p>
<p>Chief Justice agreed in the objection urged by the Right Hon.
</p>
<p>Gentleman, and Mr. Johnson having stated that it was not his
</p>
<p>intention to draw forth the disclosure of names from the witness,
</p>
<p>said that he would trouble Mr, Greaves no further.
</p>
<p>George Harris, Serjeant- Major of the 1th Hussars, examined
</p>
<p>by Mr. Torrens.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the Theatre on the night the Lord Lieu-
</p>
<p>tenant was there, was in the lower gallery ; there was a great
</p>
<p>disturbance in the upper gallery ; he noticed a person in the
</p>
<p>front 6eat of the upper gallery, with a rattle, who was par-
</p>
<p>ticularly noisy the entire night ; would know him again ; there
</p>
<p>he is between the two Handwiches, (Here the witness pointed
</p>
<p>out George Graham :) his name is Graham ; he was continu-
</p>
<p>ally making a noise with the rattle, by turning it round in
</p>
<p>his hand, and striking it against the front of the gallery ;
</p>
<p>towards the end of the play, witness saw him break the
</p>
<p>rattle; after the play, and after the glee, he (witness) saw a
</p>
<p>piece of wood nearly strike the person of his Excellency ;
</p>
<p>witness turned round to observe the actions of this Graham ;
</p>
<p>he then saw him throw another piece of wood in the same
</p>
<p>direction; don't know where the second piece of wood fell.
</p>
<p>Witness was examined by the Grand Jury ; one of the Grand

</p>
<p>Jurors disputed his testimony very much, (great laughter.)
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Witness was not much offended at the Grand Jury ; judged
</p>
<p>the two pieces of wood thrown to be similar ; thinks they
</p>
<p>were the two sides of the rattle ; witness s attention was taken
</p>
<p>up in examining the person of the individual who threw the
</p>
<p>piece of wood, the way he should know him again, so that he
</p>
<p>did not see where it fell ; he felt greater anxiety to secure the
</p>
<p>person of the individual who threw the piece of wood, than
</p>
<p>to see where the object fell ; witness swore informations the
</p>
<p>next day ; he went to the Theatre that night solely lor amuse-
</p>
<p>ment ; had leave of absence until nine o'clock ; staid longer >
</p>
<p>was a serjeant on that night; is now a serjeaut major ^ was.
</p>
<p>a serjeant for six years; violated his duty thai night by st*ty-
</p>
<p>so
</p>
<p>ing out i was promoted since ; has been engaged in escorting
</p>
<p>the Lord Lieutenant to and from the country, when with his
</p>
<p>regiment ; he has been since in the County of Kildare ; quar-
</p>
<p>ters at no particular house whilst he is in Dublin ; has paid for
</p>
<p>his dinner every day since, or thinks he will pay for it  (a
</p>
<p>laugh) ; never dined at the Park in his life; has supped in it ;
</p>
<p>drank the King's health there ; thinks he could not do a more
</p>
<p>worthy thing; witness has drank the Glorious and Immortal
</p>
<p>Memory, but not since that night (laughter) ; has not drank
</p>
<p>it at the Park ; will take care how he proposes it there the
</p>
<p>next night -he sups there.
</p>
<p>In answer to a question from one of the Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Jury, this witness said that " he saw the bottle held up by a
</p>
<p>person in the orchestra, but that he did not see it thrown."
</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Skinner examined by Mr. J. S. Townsend.
</p>
<p>Witness was on the pit door of the Theatre on that night,
</p>
<p>in order to assist the check-taker, a great crowd being ex-
</p>
<p>pected ; was on the stage after the play was over ; saw a piece
</p>
<p>of the rattle lying on the stage; witness drew it oif with a
</p>
<p>piece of wire ; this was during the last act of the farce.
</p>
<p>(Here a piece of wood was produced, which the witness
</p>
<p>identified as being that which he drew off the stage on that
</p>
<p>Bight.) This witness was not cross-examined.
</p>
<p>Mr. George Farley, examined by the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>Witness is of the profession of an Attorney ; recollects the
</p>
<p>night of the 14th of December; was not at the Theatre on
</p>
<p>that night ; was in company with a Gentleman n that night,
</p>
<p>between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, a Mr. James
</p>
<p>Troy, Merchant, in Bridge-street; went to a house in Essex-
</p>
<p>street that night with him, a tavern; had been at Mr. Troy's,
</p>
<p>%nd went with two ladies to get a carriage, to go to Richmond ;
</p>
<p>the night was cold, and on returning Mr. Troy and witness
</p>
<p>went into a tavern in Essex-street, to take a tumbler ; their
</p>
<p>going to that house was purely accidental ; a good many per-

</p>
<p>sons had been there, and went out, and some remained ; after
</p>
<p>witness and Mr. Troy had been sitting there for a short time, a
</p>
<p>good number of persons came in, in a body, and the place
</p>
<p>became crowded ; a great number got into the box opposite to
</p>
<p>where Mr. Troy and witness sat; some stood round them, and
</p>
<p>they held a conversation amongst themselves, with their head*
</p>
<p>down ; they remained in that position for some time, commu-
</p>
<p>nicating privately ; there were about eight or ten persons, or
</p>
<p>from that to twelve, at that box ; more of that party went
</p>
<p>up the room ; witness could not hear what passed among
</p>
<p>them then ; they then dispersed, some went to the lower part
</p>
<p>of the room ; some, went up stafrs, and some, witness believes,
</p>
<p>went out ; four remained in the box, these were the two Atkin-
</p>
<p>sons, Forbes, William Graham and Brownlow ; witness did.
</p>
<p>not know Forbes's name before.
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>Here the Attorney-General asked this witness if he had
</p>
<p>been examined before the Grand Jury ? to which he replied,
</p>
<p>in the most emphatic manner. " indeed I was."
</p>
<p>Browniow was not in the box with the four witness men-
</p>
<p>tioned; he sat on a table in an adjoining one. Those persons
</p>
<p>who came in in a body, seemed to be known to one another ;
</p>
<p>they conversed together, and talked of the Theatre ; one of
</p>
<p>them addressed Browniow, and accused him of his not being
</p>
<p>in his place in the gallery, according to his appointment ; he
</p>
<p>said he was as well where he was, or where he had been ; the
</p>
<p>other said, you are a pretty fellow to keep your appointment
</p>
<p> you must go to the pit  nothing would do you but the pit ;
</p>
<p>he ( Browniow) said, that " for the purpose of what was to be
</p>
<p>done, he was as well where he Mas." Witness thinks the name
</p>
<p>of the person who addressed Browniow, was M Intosh ; there
</p>
<p>was a great deal more of conversation among them ; the four
</p>
<p>ai terward-s retired to another box, to sup ; they talked of the
</p>
<p>Theatre, and spoke of throwing the bottle and the stick.
</p>
<p>Here the Attorney- General requested of the witness, that
</p>
<p>if any indecent expressions were used by any of that party,
</p>
<p>he would suppress them.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said that he was about to suggest this to
</p>
<p>the witness.
</p>
<p>The witness said, that seeing Ladies in the Court, it had
</p>
<p>been his intention to suppress every thing of the kind.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General then told the witness to repeat, sub-
</p>
<p>ject to the above limitation, whatever he heard any of that
</p>
<p>party say.
</p>
<p>The witness resumed.  He heard one of them say, after
</p>
<p>throwing the bottle and the stick had been spoken of, that
</p>
<p> it was a damned, or a b y miss ;" can't identify the par-
</p>
<p>ticular person who said it, but is certain that it was said by
</p>
<p>one of the four ; these four were, the two Atkinsons, James
</p>
<p>Forbes, and William Graham ; after supper they came back

</p>
<p>to the box where they had been sitting;. they then called for
</p>
<p>punch, and commenced giving toasts; they drank the " Glo-
</p>
<p>rious and Immortal Memory," all the company in the room
</p>
<p>standing, except Mr. Troy and witness ; the two gentlemen
</p>
<p>who had been in this box with witness and Mr. Troy, had
</p>
<p>left the room before witness ; thinks Forbes gave " The Duke
</p>
<p>of York and the Army ;" Forbes was extremely violent in his
</p>
<p>manner and expressions; the other three were more peace-
</p>
<p>able; he (Forbes) appeared to take the lead in every thing;
</p>
<p>he thumped the table violently, and said w let them transport
</p>
<p>me, its the worst they can do ; I don't car*.' a damn, provided
</p>
<p>Papists, and Popish Governments are put down." Forbes
</p>
<p>also said, " 1 don't care if I am sent to Botany Bay, or to
</p>
<p>Hell, provided one ouject that I have in view is accompli' 1 >
</p>
<p>H
</p>
<p>but the worst of is, wherever I go, I am sure of meeting a
</p>
<p>Papist." He did not state what the precise object was that
</p>
<p>he had in view ; he gave *' Here's confusion to John Smith
</p>
<p>Fleming, the Popish Lord Mayor, the b y Marquis Wel-
</p>
<p>lesley and all Popish Governors ;" witness could not recollect
</p>
<p>all he said ; he (witness) heard some expressions of being better
</p>
<p>prepared on the occasion of a future visit ; cannot say who
</p>
<p>used those expressions ; the passage in the room between the
</p>
<p>boxes was not more than four feet wide ; no one there ex-
</p>
<p>pressed disapprobation of what was said by Mr. Forbes.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Blackburne.
</p>
<p>My name, Sir, is Farley, (Mr. Blackburne had addressed
</p>
<p>the witness as Mr. Farrelly ;) witness went to that house in
</p>
<p>Fssex-street, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock on
</p>
<p>that night, and remained there until twelve - r went in company
</p>
<p>with Mr. Troy there ; spoke to Mr. Percival as he was going
</p>
<p>out ; witness had no objection to some of their toasts ; would
</p>
<p>have left the house sooner but from the inattention of tha
</p>
<p>waiters ; took a second tumbler ; when witness and Mr. Troy
</p>
<p>came away, they left the others after them ; there were four
</p>
<p>in the box opposite to witness and Mr. Troy, Mr. Brownlow
</p>
<p>was in the next box, and three gentlemen stood at the fire ;
</p>
<p>one of those witness believed was a Mr. Pounden ; witness
</p>
<p>and Mr. Troy remained until about twelve o'clock ; the door
</p>
<p>was shut when they were coming away ; witness did not des-
</p>
<p>cribe this party as being in three parts of the house ; on
</p>
<p>coming in they sat in the box opposite to witness and Mr.
</p>
<p>Troy; can't swear if they drank any thin? before supper;
</p>
<p>believes they did ; can't identify the person who, when the
</p>
<p>throwing of the bottle or the stick was spoken of, said that
</p>
<p>* it was a b y miss ! !" Witness does not think Forbes
</p>
<p>was tipsey ; does not think he was incapable of knowing
</p>
<p>what he was saying, although he was giving the toasts very
</p>
<p>incoherently ; it was a public tavern in which witness met
</p>
<p>him ; they were strangers to each other ; when he spoke of

</p>
<p>going to Botany Bay, he did not state his object.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scriven.
</p>
<p>Witness was in the tavern before those Gentlemen rushed
</p>
<p>in ; cannot say if William Brownlow was there before the
</p>
<p>rush; Brownlow was by himself, after these people came in;
</p>
<p>M'lutosh was not near him ; witness swears positively, that
</p>
<p>they communicated together notwithstanding ; Pounden and
</p>
<p>two others sat opposite to where Mr. Brownlow sat; witnesi
</p>
<p>thinks they were not in the room till after the rush ; M'Cul-
</p>
<p>lagh was in the lower end of the room ; they said, * it was
</p>
<p>a damned, and b y miss ;" witness on his oath says, that
</p>
<p>it was not "ad d and b y trick 1 ' they said; the
</p>
<p>words were "so few, that witaess thmks whoever used theui
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>did not let his voice down, but kept it elevated to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion ; witness will, however, swear positively that the word
</p>
<p>tnck was not used ; when the toasts were given, Brownlow
</p>
<p>raised his glass, and drank, but remained quietly on the table ;
</p>
<p>when charged with being in the gallery, he said he was as
</p>
<p>well where he was for the purpose ; M'Intosh muttered some-
</p>
<p>thing in an under tone, which witness did not hear.
</p>
<p>James Troy, examined by the Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>Witness remembers the night the Lord Lieutenant went t
</p>
<p>the Theatre ; Mr. Farley was at witness's house on that night,
</p>
<p>and they went out together ; they went out to escort seme la-
</p>
<p>dies who had dined at witness's house ; they proceeded alongr
</p>
<p>the quays to Essex-bridge, where witness prevailed on one of
</p>
<p>the ladies who was rather weak, to take a coach ; witness's
</p>
<p>dwelling-house is on Arran quay, and his house of business in
</p>
<p>Bridge-street ; witness and Farley proceeded after this over
</p>
<p>Essex bridge, conversing till they came to a tavern in Essex-
</p>
<p>street, kept by a person of the name of Flanagan ; as the night
</p>
<p>was cold, they went in there to take a tumbler; conjectures
</p>
<p>that Mr. Farley and witness entered the tavern between tea
</p>
<p>and eleven o'clock that night; they got into a box in which
</p>
<p>there were several persons ; they all remained there for some
</p>
<p>short time ; they talked of the occurrences at the Theatre ;
</p>
<p>some of them put questions to one of the party, respecting
</p>
<p>the part taken by him on that occasion ; they asked, why were
</p>
<p>not you at your post in the galleries ; witness was not ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the person who asked and answered these ques-
</p>

<p>pressions, "Blast them how it missed ;" or words to that ef-

<p>Was now in for it  that he did not care, provided the Papists
</p>
<p>were down ; witness also heard a deal of ribaldry and reflex-
</p>
<p>ions op Popery, such as extermination to Pope and Popery ;
</p>
<p>also, confusion to the Popish Lord Mayor, John Smith Flem-
</p>
<p>ing, and the bloody Marquis Wellesley ; witness can't call to

<p>mind any other expressions ; heard Forbes say, u send me to

<p>Newgate  transport, or send me to Hel{  I'd suffer any thing
</p>
<p>to attain one object ; but I meet a Papist every where ; they
</p>
<p>then drank several toasts, such as the King, the Duke of York,
</p>
<p>Protestant Ascendancy, &c. they also said, we shall be better

<p>prepared another time ; don't remember who said this, but
</p>
<p>heard it*

</p>
<p>Mr. Troy, cross-examined hy Mr. Rolleston.
</p>
<p>The witness states that he is not in the habit of drinking the
</p>
<p>Glorous and Immortal Memory ; can't say. he intends to drink
</p>
<p>it ; formed no intention at all on the matter, but would drink
</p>
<p>it in the proper acceptation ; he would drink it as the health of
</p>
<p>a brave and good man.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston  It seemed to stick in your throat for pome
</p>
<p>tine  (much laughter.)  Did not drink this toast that night
</p>
<p>at Flanagan's; can neither say that he was or was not highly
</p>
<p>gratified by the drinking of this toast on that night; he did not
</p>
<p>take notes of what was said that night ; there were three or
</p>
<p>four in the box where the toast was drank ; who had not a bet-
</p>
<p>ter opportunity of hearing it than he. Pray explain ? The
</p>
<p>expressions were loud enough for me to hear. Were the per-
</p>
<p>son* conferring with eaeh other? I can't say ; I was but a
</p>
<p>listener ; I saw Forbes ; he did appear to have been warm with
</p>
<p>liquor ; if the witness had committed high treason, by blowing
</p>
<p>a whistle, he don't thing he would have been so imprudent
</p>
<p>as to disclose it in a public tavern ; the Traversers saw witness
</p>
<p>and his companion there, and we were total strangers to them,
</p>
<p>nevertheless they mentioned the whole matter, which was very
</p>
<p>imprudent ; witness thinks they would not have published all
</p>
<p>this if they had thought they had committed any crime ; don't
</p>
<p>know what the Traversers may think of this matter ; witness
</p>
<p>thinks Forbes was more mad and intemperate than drunk.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston. I am sure of that  (laughter.) Forbes
</p>
<p>said that he had gained his object ; the witness don't know the
</p>
<p>object of Forbes in using these expressions ; thinks his object
</p>
<p>was to support the Protestant Government.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston Did not the toasting the healths of the
</p>
<p>King and Duke of York confirm your opinion ? It did more
</p>
<p>strongly ; he did not dislike Forbes for these toasts ; they are
</p>
<p>toasts which he drinks very often himself, but he seldom sits in
</p>
<p>company with those who drink them, where the Glorious Me-

</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  The Court wishes to know if it be the in-
</p>
<p>tention to persevere in this line of examination.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston. -My Lord, I shall ask but one question
</p>
<p>more.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  We have only permitted your cross exami-
</p>
<p>nation, because no objection was made.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolletson. Were not Forbes's expressions in favour of
</p>
<p>Protestanism  and in disfavor of Catholicity f
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  The witness has proved this before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Rolleston.  If this be so, I will ask no more questions.
</p>
<p>Mr. W EESTER, examined by the Attorney General.
</p>
<p>Was in the Theatre with the Lord Lieutenant, as Aid-de-
</p>
<p>Camp," on the night of the 14th Dec. and recollects a stick or
</p>
<p>S5
</p>
<p>hard substance having been thrown ; it struck the cushion ox'
</p>
<p>the box next to his Excellency, it rebounded and passed in front
</p>
<p>of his Excellency's head ; 1 then stood up, and pointing to the
</p>
<p>hole in the cushion, the audience cried shame ; the rent in the
</p>
<p>cushion of the box was mid-way.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pen in.
</p>
<p>The people cried shame, and disapprobation was manifested
</p>
<p>by one hundred people.
</p>
<p>Cross-ex amhied by Mr. Scriven.
</p>
<p>The wood hit about eight inches from his Excellency's box,
</p>
<p>and after it rebounded I knew no more of it.
</p>
<p>CASE CLOSED ON THE PART OF THE CROWN.
</p>
<p>After the case had been closed on the part of the Crown,
</p>
<p>Mr. F. Mills. My Lord, one of Jurors wishes to ask Mr.
</p>
<p>Webster a question, and he need not stir from -where he is.
</p>
<p>Mr. F. Mills. Was the rent occasioned by the hard sub-
</p>
<p>stance ? I have no hesitation in saying it was ; the rent was
</p>
<p>about the size of a shilling.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscpll then rose and addressed the Jury for George
</p>
<p>Graham and Mathew Handwich.
</p>
<p>" My Lords and Gentlemen  I never before rose under such
</p>
<p>overwhelming emotions ; but, without giving utterance to any
</p>
<p>thing that can excite angry feelings, & relying altogether on your
</p>
<p>justice, and on the soundness of your judgments, I shall address
</p>
<p>myself altogether to your understandings and common sense,
</p>
<p>without attempting to inflame or agitate your passions. My
</p>
<p>I^ords and Gentlemen, on the day after this transaction the
</p>
<p>whole city was filled with alarm, and every one believed that
</p>
<p>the plan, as at present charged, was formed and attempted. At
</p>
<p>the parish meetings assembled on the occasion, I, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>joined with my fellow-citizens in expressing my indignation ;
</p>
<p>but I am now convinced, Gentlemen, that the Noble Personage
</p>
<p>who was addressed, feels convinced that too much importance
</p>
<p>has been thrown around the business, and that the stain of the

</p>
<p>whole has been washed away. In these addresses indignation
</p>
<p>was the most prominent feeling, and even now every epithet that
</p>
<p>the imagination can conjure up, and that the press can give vent
</p>
<p>to, have been applied to the unfortunate Traversers, at present
</p>
<p>under trial. Considering then, Gentlemen, the frailty of man,
</p>
<p>can your minds and your judgments be free, and are you sine
</p>
<p>that you are unbiassed.  Addressing myself to your passions,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, 1 would implore you to stitfe and to still them, and
</p>
<p>to give freedom to the best gift that Heaven has blessed you
</p>
<p>with  your judgment. Gentlemen  you could not fail to have
</p>
<p>been further excited by the splendid address of the Attorney
</p>
<p>General ; the n o>t powerful and the most eloquent that I ever
</p>
<p>heard delivered in a court of justice. Gentlemen, your admi-
</p>
<p>ration must have been excited, and your Common sense led fr
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>away by that most feeling and eloquent address. Gentlemen*
</p>
<p>the Attorney General has said right, this was a most important
</p>
<p>trial, because it will decide whether these men were so heroic in
</p>
<p>iniquity, jis to attempt the crime with which the Traversers are
</p>
<p>charged. Gentlemen, you are told of his Excellency's public
</p>
<p>services ; of his having quelled an open rebellion ; of his hav-
</p>
<p>ing averted a famine. Gentlemen, these things are all true : my
</p>
<p>clients don't deny it; but Gentlemen, this parade of virtue must
</p>
<p>have prepared your minds too readily to receive the evfdence.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen use your discretion and judgment, but do not be
</p>
<p>borne down, and never forget that John Atkinson has positive-
</p>
<p>ly sworn, that it was no part of the alled'ged plan to offend or
</p>
<p>assault the Lord Lieutenant. If a reluctant and treacherous
</p>
<p>witness can have any effect on you, you must acquit the prison-
</p>
<p>ers, my clients/'
</p>
<p>Attorney General.  I wish to apprize Mr. Driscoll, that he is
</p>
<p>not to take for granted, that we admit altogether his statement,
</p>
<p>because we do not contradict it in this stage.
</p>
<p>Mr. DriGeoH resumed.  " My Lords, I dare say it was a
</p>
<p>mixture of kindness towards me, as well as a sense of public
</p>
<p>duty, that induced the Attorney- General to make those remarks,
</p>
<p>but, Gentlemen, I should like to be set right, for I do not
</p>
<p>wish to practice imposture. Gentlemen, a corrupt witness
</p>
<p>blunders, and discloses the foulness of his heart. With re-
</p>
<p>spect to George Atkinson, after giving his evidence, he tells
</p>
<p>you, that on Thursday or Friday he began to feel some scru-
</p>
<p>ples : his amiable heart was touched, and c-ff he went in the
</p>
<p>most affectionate manner to disclose the whole ta the Represen-
</p>
<p>tative, but a centinel changes his resolve, and he goes to the
</p>
<p>widow's in Ship-street, and punctually marshals his forces, and
</p>
<p>places them at their posts. Gentlemen, I dismiss that fellow,
</p>
<p>with these observations : His brother and father enjoy places
</p>
<p>under Government, and, notwithstanding, they go to the
</p>
<p>Theatre to make the Government; unpopular, and he closes

</p>
<p>the detail of the plan, with stating that it was not the intention
</p>
<p>to assail or offend. How could he effect his object, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>w ithout assailing or offending ? Gentlemen, this fellow is not
</p>
<p>afraid to admit that George Graham was brought to the thea-
</p>
<p>tre, but he does not venture to state there was any rattle. He
</p>
<p>says of Mr. Handwich, that he desired him to bring his bro-
</p>
<p>ther with a number of men, to go to the play-house, and that
</p>
<p>Handwich assented. Here two unfortunate persons are to be
</p>
<p>consigned to punishment, because two wretches give evidence
</p>
<p>against them. Gentlemen, when I consider the majesty of
</p>
<p>the trial by jury, I cannot think you would lend yourselves to
</p>
<p>such reprobates as the Atkinsons. It has been said, that the
</p>
<p>overt act was to fling the bottle.  With a glimmering recollec-
</p>
<p>tion of the doctrine of vision, I am unable to explain how a
</p>
<p>person who states the bottle to have danced across his eyes in
</p>
<p>*he descent, with a velocity in proportion to the height from
</p>
<p>il
</p>
<p>which it was flung. I am unable, I say, to account how tlu>
</p>
<p>person could follow it in its descent, and detect it in tfte act of
</p>
<p>hitting the drop curtain. Gentlemen  look at the inconsistency
</p>
<p>of tiiis evidence  one states, that Henry Handwich had room
</p>
<p>for another person near him, while another person states, that
</p>
<p>the crowds were so great, that they could not stir. But I will
</p>
<p>prove that Handwich had no bottle at all, and we shall produce
</p>
<p>evidence to contradict Kelly and the Rev. Dr. from Ballinakill.
</p>
<p>I was amazed at this man's account, " boys look to your tire,'*
</p>
<p>which is only mentioned by him alone ; and further, look at
</p>
<p>the discrepancy between him and Farrell, who states that
</p>
<p>Handwich managed to have nobody near, while the Doctor,
</p>
<p>let loose from the pound, (laughter,) states, that the crowd was
</p>
<p>so great, and the gallery so stuffed, that Handwich had to bend
</p>
<p>over. I don't like to impute perjury, but I have a sacred duty
</p>
<p>to perform, and I have evidence to prove that Dr. M'Namara
</p>
<p>is not worthy of credit,  Gentlemen, it has been the practice
</p>
<p>of corrupt and interested men in all ages, to speculate on tem-
</p>
<p>poral advantages. This Doctor has been sentenced to three
</p>
<p>months imprisonment, one fortnight of which has only expired.
</p>
<p>Dj you think, from his character and conduct, that such a
</p>
<p>mind would hesitate to speculate on the clemency of the Mar*
</p>
<p>quis Wellesley.  By his evidence here this day, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the host judges and the ablest men, have been imposed on,
</p>
<p>and surely, the Attorney-General may have been duped in
</p>
<p>the present case. But, Gentlemen  independently of all this,
</p>
<p>there is a privilege given of hissing and applauding at Theatres,
</p>
<p>which has existed since their origin, and we shall bring an old
</p>
<p>and venerable lady here, nursed in the lap of luxury, who
</p>
<p>will tell you that she never felt any alarm, and did not consider
</p>
<p>the noi<e greater than usual. Flow then could the young, the
</p>
<p>vigorous, and the athletic be afraid. Gentlemen  Farrell, a
</p>
<p>working jeweller, who came here from England four years
</p>
<p>ago, says, he heard the cry of " Boys look out," and tJutt a

</p>
<p>man whom he had never seen before, but of large person,
</p>
<p>and who must be of necessity, Heiry Handwich, flung the
</p>
<p>bottle.  Farrell is so inflated with loyalty, that he thinks you
</p>
<p>should give credence to his wonderful powers of identification.
</p>
<p>The Djctor, who had never seen Handwich before, recognizes
</p>
<p>him at a glance, as the person who cried out ' mind your fire/
</p>
<p>notwithstanding the dusky and dun light in the galleries.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall prove to you that it will be impossible to
</p>
<p>give Farrell credit. It is said that Graham had a watch-man's
</p>
<p>rattle, and that he flung the twa sides of it successively ; but
</p>
<p>I shall prove it was not a watch-inan's rattle, but a dapper
</p>
<p>used by farmers for the purpose of clapping, and it broke acci-
</p>
<p>dentally ; and that some person snatched up the end of it and
</p>
<p>flung it down-^and all this is visited on this unfortunate youth
</p>
<p> Gentlemen - if you listen to your consciences, you must
</p>
<p>acquit these men, and 1 pray you to do Your duty."
</p>
<p>5S '
</p>
<p>Mr. North rose to address the Court on behalf of Henry
</p>
<p>Handwich and William Graham.
</p>
<p>' My Lords and Gentlemen I confess I was most anxious
</p>
<p>to obtain a postponement of this trial, on account of the
</p>
<p>ferment of the public mind. What part of the land has not
</p>
<p>been disturbed ; what hill, what valley, no matter how remote,
</p>
<p>how solitary, or how lonely, that has not re-echoed with the
</p>
<p>awful and alarming sounds of conspiracy and confederation ?
</p>
<p>My Lords, we have had Addresses from the Churches, from
</p>
<p>the Counties, from ths Cities, from the Towns, from the
</p>
<p>Guilds, from the Corporations, from the Parishes, individually,
</p>
<p>and in one grand simultaneous effcrt collectively, all ringing
</p>
<p>the charges on the words, assassins, conspirators, murderers,
</p>
<p>&c. taking guilt tor granted, and with ready wishes anticipat-
</p>
<p>ing punishment. But, my Lords, much as we have been
</p>
<p>heated by this over excitation  much as we have been stimu-
</p>
<p>lated jin the hot-bed of political feeling,the effect produced waa
</p>
<p>small, very small indeed, when compared with the rich, g]>v. -
</p>
<p>ing, even varied, and most agitating eloquence of these ad-
</p>
<p>mirable Answers, which have fanned the flame till it has be-
</p>
<p>come a most consuming fire. But, Gentlemen, thanks be to
</p>
<p>Heaven, although the victims aie bound and bleeding, the
</p>
<p>first beam of light that we have enjoyed has broken from the
</p>
<p>darkest, spot in the horizon, and some security of acquittal is
</p>
<p>afforded to my clients, from the monstrousness of the charge
</p>
<p>which the Attorney General has brought against them 
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the sea yet heaves and rolls, though the storm has
</p>
<p>subsided, and the earth has been rocked to and fro by the
</p>
<p>agitation of its motion. Gentlemen, it is impossible, when
</p>
<p>the elements are convulsed and crashing together, that you
</p>
<p>can have remained unmoved. There is in this case an in-
</p>
<p>auspicious alliance between the power of the Government and
</p>
<p>the power of the people, and this is the reasoo why I would
</p>
<p>forewarn you to be doubly cautious. The worst species of

</p>
<p>despotism is that to which the people are a party, and when
</p>
<p>aided by the crown, its force is overbearing 9 overwhelming,
</p>
<p>and irresistible. What is there so dangerous as this c alition ?
</p>
<p>The Vultus instantis tyranni -The Civium ardor prava juben-
</p>
<p>tium. When these two conjoin, the flood-gates of oppression
</p>
<p>are let Injse, and the full tide of despotic power rushes with
</p>
<p>uncontrouled force. May my unfortunate clients be removed
</p>
<p>from its influence. I do not believe that the Attorney
</p>
<p>General was induced by any consideration but a sense of duty*
</p>
<p>to undertake these prosecutions ; but in my mind, this was a
</p>
<p>mistaken sense. Gentlemen, it is unknown to our Constitution?
</p>
<p>that the very case which has been discussed by a Grand Jury
</p>
<p>should be again brought forward by the Attorney General I
</p>
<p>confess Idid expect to have heard precedents cited, but my
</p>
<p>C9
</p>
<p>turprige was unequalled when I heard none, and I have now
</p>
<p>practically learned, that the finding of a Grand Jury is
</p>
<p>a mere nullity. But if ex-ojficios are to be used at all, why
</p>
<p>was not the Grand Jury dispensed with altogether ? Why was
</p>
<p>circuitous and round-about methods adopted ?
</p>
<p>" My Lords  in reference to a passage from the Commons
</p>
<p>Journals, brought forward with great art and infinite address
</p>
<p>by the Attorney Genera!, I would remark, that in that case
</p>
<p>the Bills were endorsed by mistake, and that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General's getting the indictment quashed, roused the attention
</p>
<p>of the House of Commons on the subject. The House con-
</p>
<p>sulted the most eminent lawyers of the day, and they unani-
</p>
<p>mously decided, that there was no such example from the ear-
</p>
<p>liest period of the Constitution. And this is the precedent on.
</p>
<p>which an ex-officio % under any circumstances an arbitrary pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, it to be justified. What says SirMathew Hale, that
</p>
<p>great model of Christian piety, political sagacity, and legal
</p>
<p>wisdom. He says, presentment or indictment are the only
</p>
<p>legal methods of proceeding against a subject. What says
</p>
<p>Mr. Fox, who brought to the study of the Constitution the
</p>
<p>knowledge of a lawyer, and the science of s statesman. He
</p>
<p>says, " if these, the corner-stones of the Constitution, are
</p>
<p>removed, the whole edifice must come topling to the ground,
</p>
<p>because the main prop of all is the juridical power of the
</p>
<p>people, through the intervention of Grand and Petit Juries."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, open force is not to be dreaded, for every man is
</p>
<p>aware of his enemy. Arbitrary proceedings are not so much
</p>
<p>to be dreaded, or so dangerous, as this proceeding, which is
</p>
<p>disguised, and of which the injustice and the illegality are not
</p>
<p>so glaringly apparent. What, says a writer, whom, no doubt,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-Genera! admires, and with whose sentiments he
</p>
<p>in general agrees ; speaking of the force of bad example, he
</p>
<p>says, " one precedent, creates another  what ^yesterday was
</p>
<p>fact, to-day is doctrine, and when both are wanting, the de-

</p>
<p>fect is supplied by analogy." It would be indecorous in me to
</p>
<p>pronounce this august tribunal as illegal ; but I do arraign the
</p>
<p>proceedings as discountenanced by  as alien from, the spirit of
</p>
<p>British law, and as unconstitutional. Gentlemen, this charge
</p>
<p>is a conspiracy. Do no suffer your minds to be wrought upon.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General will tell you, that the benches in the
</p>
<p>Theatre might be torn up  that the pannels of the boxes might
</p>
<p>be broken  that the Theatre itself might be razed with the
</p>
<p>ground, before he would file an cx-ojjicio, had not the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant been present. Gentlemen, this is a state trial ;
</p>
<p>but the ridicule of riot does not rest upon us or on the Court.
</p>
<p>The question is, whether there was a conspiracy or not, and
</p>
<p>this 1 .-hall be able" to grapple with, and overcome. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>it was proved that these men arc Orangemen ; they do not dis*
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>:'
</p>
<p>60
</p>
<p>guise it ; they glory in it ; they boast of it. Perhaps it is not
</p>
<p>ray private opinion that this society or system is well calculated
</p>
<p>to attain the ends to which it aspires, but here I differ from
</p>
<p>the wisest, the most experienced men in the country. Hare
</p>
<p>these men ever been charged with disloyalty to theSovereign or
</p>
<p>his Representative? Their loyalty is an inborn and inbred part
</p>
<p>of their existence  it is " flesh of their flesh," " bone of
</p>
<p>" their bone." It is not the loyalty of a day, or a minute, or
</p>
<p>an occasion, or a purpose  it is not the loyalty which atones
</p>
<p>for a factious illegality to-day, by a cringing sycophancy to-
</p>
<p>morrow  it is with these men a pure, a fervent, a holy pas-
</p>
<p>sion  their enemies say a prejudice. The Attorney Gene-
</p>
<p>ral calls your attention to the state measures of his Majesty.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, His Majesty's Cabinet are not on their trial, and
</p>
<p>with that Cabinet in your capacity of Jurors, you have nothing
</p>
<p>to do. He has next adverted to the dressing of King William ;
</p>
<p>*ipnn that subject I shall give my private opinion  if the
</p>
<p>opinion of an humble individual can be at all important.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I do think that that exhibition of bad taste, as
</p>
<p>the Attorney General calls it, should be abolished.  I do think
</p>
<p>that that idle and unnecessary ceremony should and aught to be
</p>
<p>dispensed with. There is not a man in the community more
</p>
<p>desirous than I am that my Roman Catholic fellow- subjects
</p>
<p>should have the full benefit of the acquisitions of industry  the
</p>
<p>prize of talents, and the rewards of loyalty  I have avowed this
</p>
<p>at public meetings and in private companies  I have avowed
</p>
<p>it in canvassing Protestant electors : but, notwithstanding all
</p>
<p>* this, I confess I was taken by surprize when T saw the revered
</p>
<p>image stripped of its accustomed honors, which had been the
</p>
<p>old man's pleasure, and the poor man's pride. When I saw the
</p>
<p>captive monarch inclosed by armed men, and fortified by dou-
</p>
<p>ble rows of infantry and cavalry, as if some Soipian barbarian
</p>
<p>from the Tarns and the Volga, had meditated to mollify the

</p>
<p>Chief Justice -This is not to be wondered at, but at the same
</p>
<p>time, such an exhibition is unsuited to a Court cf Justice, and
</p>
<p>cannot be tolerated.
</p>
<p>Mr. North then resumed. " When such were my feelings,
</p>
<p>what must have been the sentiments of those who consider
</p>
<p>Orangeism and Protestant Ascendency the main-props of the
</p>
<p>Constitution ? I shall not presume to follow the Attorney Ge-
</p>
<p>neral in his panegyric on Kin^ William. Were I even an ido-
</p>
<p>lator of that great man, I would not, by attempting to sing his
</p>
<p>praises, deface the impression which the Attorney General has
</p>
<p>made. I shall not attempt to follow the flight of that sublime
</p>
<p>imagination, whose freshness and fertility are unequalled. I
</p>
<p>shall not grapple with that "mint of mind, ' whose power ha*
</p>
<p>coined such beautiful imagery, and whose discretion has so ju-
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>diciously applied it. I shall not shoot arrows at the sun, or at-
</p>
<p>tempt to stop the veering of the wind. To follow the Attorney
</p>
<p>General would be a task not less difficult than either. But the
</p>
<p>Attorney General is not to be otfended at the offerings of the
</p>
<p>poor and the lowly. The rude wonder of the Shepherds was as
</p>
<p>palateable as the niyrhh and frankinsense of the Eastern Kings.
</p>
<p>You were told that the mantua- maker did not rightly adjust the
</p>
<p>millinery. You were told that the painter had not the imag na-
</p>
<p>tive power of a Rubins, or the graphic art of a Raphael; but
</p>
<p>it is the feeling, the delightful enthusiasm, that I look to, not the
</p>
<p>taste ; and I will not quarrel with these poor men, if they did
</p>
<p>not, in their offering, equal the first of artists  the Attorney
</p>
<p>General. But there was nature in their offering ; it sprung
</p>
<p>from the best feeling of the human breast  feelings which w a
</p>
<p>cannot resist, but do not understand. There are a thousand
</p>
<p>chosen feelings of this nature to be cherished, springing from
</p>
<p>the same soil and parentage  drawing one sword for the same
</p>
<p>Sovereign--bowing down before the same altar of a common,
</p>
<p>faith ; these are bonds as sensitive as they are strong, and never
</p>
<p>were they brushed or broken with impunity. The feeble, pli-
</p>
<p>ant Hindoo, who bows his neck before every Conqueror, had
</p>
<p>never permitted one change in his faith. Nor Tamerlaine, nor
</p>
<p>Zindas, nr Wellesley were able to effect this. And why, there-
</p>
<p>fore, Gentlemen, would you expect such a sacrifice from my
</p>
<p>clients. Gentlemen, I admit that the undressing of the Statue
</p>
<p>was, with these men, unpopular ; so it was with the Common
</p>
<p>Council, and many of the Guilds, when the Lord Mayor had
</p>
<p>issued his Proclamation. Then the Lord Lieutenant goes to the
</p>
<p>Theatre for the first time, although he had been a year in the
</p>
<p>country before. Don't imagine, Gentlemen, that the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant goes to the Theatre for the purpose of seeing the
</p>
<p>play  it is no such thing. The Lord Lieutenant goes to receive
</p>
<p>applause, and if he deserve it, is sure to be signified. The
</p>
<p>L?rd Lieutenant goes with this object, and Handwich wishes

<p>to oppose the ride of popularity. Is there any thing criminal
</p>
<p>in this, and has any thing more been proved? My clients go to
</p>
<p>an Orange Lodge  they profess devotion to the King, and the
</p>
<p>Royal Family  they determine to inform the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>of what was concealed from him by his friends  namely, the
</p>
<p>unpopularity of preventing the dressing of the Statue ; and
</p>
<p>they further determine to call for the " Boyne Water." This
</p>
<p>was the tune that rallied and roused the blood of their ances-
</p>
<p>tors, and associated the glory of a bye gone age with the pre-
</p>
<p>sent time.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, perhaps my clients went also for the purpose
</p>
<p>of shouting and groaning the Lord Mayor; but, Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>have yet to learn whether there is any thing in the name of
</p>
<p>Lord Mayor (ex vi termini, as the grammarians call it, or Ex-
</p>
<p>ifficioj to speak with the Attorney*- General)  (laughter)
</p>
<p>6f
</p>
<p>which shields him from the disapprobation of his fellow -citizen?.
</p>
<p>I have never heard that his sacred presence  (laughter)  w;is
</p>
<p>environed or " hedged in" by the divinity of Majesty. I have
</p>
<p>never heard that he could touch for the evil, or that his white
</p>
<p>mace possessed the magic influence of Abraham's rod 
</p>
<p>(laughter.) Gentlemen  Any one who has an adequate con-
</p>
<p>ception of the powers of the Attorney -General, must know
</p>
<p>that he possesses the singular faculty of rendering the plainest
</p>
<p>things startling, singular, and extraordinary. But afteF the
</p>
<p>examination of Atkinson, every one must have felt that the
</p>
<p>evidence of the Attorney General was crumbling and dilapidat-
</p>
<p>ing. It is said that the Traversers had another object beside
</p>
<p>manifesting disapprobation ; but 1 deny it. Perhaps when they
</p>
<p>"wished that his Excellency should quit the Theatre, they also
</p>
<p>wished, with the blessing of God  (laughter)  that he should
</p>
<p>quit the country too- But, Gentlemen, one of the witnesses
</p>
<p>says, that he advised the parties to leave their sticks behind
</p>
<p>them, and he does not venture to swear that they did not take
</p>
<p>his advice. But, Gentlemen, where were the means, the in-
</p>
<p>struments, the arms, the guns, the pistols, the swords to drive
</p>
<p>him from the Theatre? We'll get him away, says one  yes,
</p>
<p>gays another, I will arm myself with a whistle  1'il whistle him
</p>
<p>oft  (laughter.)  Very good, says a third, and I will hiss him
</p>
<p>with a clapper  (laughter.)  Oh, says a fourth, 111 split his
</p>
<p>skull with a vial  no, I beg pardon, a quart bottle, which only

</p>
<p>who would,
</p>
<p>* r-  " His quietas make
</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin."  (Laughter.)
</p>
<p>And thus was the Lord Lieutenant to be driven to the Pigeon-
</p>
<p>house, or Howth, from thence to be shipped with ^steam and
</p>
<p>smoke for England  (laughter.) But, Gentlemen, look a
</p>
<p>little nearer at these wise conspirators ; they did not get near
</p>
<p>his Excellency; they went to the upper gallery with that

<p>*' infernal machine" the rattle, and determined to be sure of
</p>
<p>letting his venerable head, by ihe utter impossibility of seeing
</p>
<p>him at, ail.  Oh! wise and enlightened conspirators, excel-
</p>
<p>lently wicked traitors. George Atkinson says they went to
</p>
<p>the right hand side of the gallery ; but the fact is, these men
</p>
<p>were at the extreme left. Now, I ask, has this evidence a
</p>
<p>shadow ef probability ? On whose evidence have you all this ?
</p>
<p>on the evidence of two brothers ; the sworn allies of these men
</p>
<p>who get possession of their secrets merely to betray them. 
</p>
<p>Are these the Judas's  the arch-traitors, on w hose testimony
</p>
<p>you will convict. These fellows belonged to an Orange Lodge,
</p>
<p>but the bond of that oath is insignificant, when compared with
</p>
<p>the friend&hip they have betrayed. Is it lucre that has urged
</p>
<p>oil these wretches ? if it be I hope their reward will be in hard
</p>
<p>t>3
</p>
<p>ash. I hope they will have no place as a compensation, and
</p>
<p>thus spread an epidemic treason through the Country. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, would you take a limb from a spider, a leg from a fly,
</p>
<p>on such testim ny. But 1 shall be told, doubtless, by the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General, that these men might tell truth, though thry
</p>
<p>break confidence. But I am not a living man if every word they
</p>
<p>have uttered be not a lie. I won't defile my mouth by the epi-
</p>
<p>phets to which these men are entitled. Gentlemen, George
</p>
<p>Atkinson says that he went to the Lodge, at the Phoenix-park,
</p>
<p>that the sentinel stopped him and that he did not stop to rea-
</p>
<p>son or argue with the sentinel ; and after all tin's he supplies
</p>
<p>the whistles and joins in the supper and conviviality, JSo man
</p>
<p>can believe this evidence. But I ask, why did not the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General prccuce the sentinel ? Be he English, Irish, or
</p>
<p>Scotch, 1 am sure he would give the lie to George Atkinson.
</p>
<p>There is a grea; latitude given to a Jury, but no such latitude
</p>
<p>as this, that I believe a part, but not the whole. Then comes
</p>
<p>the brother, ' par nobile Jratrum ;" the drops of sweat steal-
</p>
<p>ing down this man's forehead, and the whole contour of hi*
</p>
<p>visage reminded me of what Dr. Johnson said of Calibans
</p>
<p>face in the M Tempest.'  " It is clouded by the gloominess of
</p>
<p>his temper, and the malignity of his purposes.'' When asked
</p>
<p>to explain, his answer was, "did not occur," and had these
</p>
<p>words the felicity pf an Italian idiom, they would be held up
</p>
<p>to every fluttering, stammering witness, as a second " Non mi
</p>
<p>ricordo'S' This witness now seeks out for a locus penitenlice^
</p>
<p>and gives his conscience a little resting place, by letting out
</p>
<p>that no true Orangeman could have thrown the bottle  so
</p>
<p>much for the two Atkinsons. With respect to Wm. Graham,
</p>
<p>my client, there is scarcely a tittle of evidence. Mr. Low-
</p>
<p>lier, states that he bought six pit tickets, but truth is, that he
</p>
<p>went to the Theatra in company with persons who will prove
</p>
<p>he bought only one pit ticket. There were a number of these
</p>
<p>foolish placards, which, if they had been overlooked, had

</p>
<p>never been further heard of, and Graham picked up some of
</p>
<p>these. Lambert states that Graham groaned his Excellency.
</p>
<p>Now, it will be proved that, on the contrary, he cheered him,
</p>
<p>although he did not cheer the Lord Mayor. It will also be
</p>
<p>proved, that Graham left the pit at the conclusion of the se-
</p>
<p>cond act. I come now to the other defendant, Henry Hand*
</p>
<p>wich, my client also. The assassinating part rests with him.
</p>
<p>"Who are the persons who attempt to establish this ? Henry
</p>
<p>Handwich was in the third row of the upper gallery,
</p>
<p>where there are a number of props, &c. supporting the ceiling,
</p>
<p>and from the third row he flung this bottle at the Lord Lieut.
</p>
<p>The first is, that " ore rolundo" Gentleman, the Jew, or
</p>
<p>jeweller, (I beg his pardon, I thought he was a Hebraist) wh
</p>
<p>has spent all his time in London. I wish this vsnue had been
</p>
<p>64
</p>
<p>laid in Covent-garden, where I will venture to say, this witness
</p>
<p>is better knowii. I would be sworn the inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>Strand, York-street, Catherine-street, James-street, Henri-
</p>
<p>etta-street, and St. Martin's-lane, can give him a right good
</p>
<p>character.
</p>
<p>* Gentlemen  Is it probable that a man of good character
</p>
<p>would leave that mart of Gommerce and of wealth, where a
</p>
<p>man of industry is sure to succeed, to take up his residence in
</p>
<p>Dame-court, Dublin. This witness, Gentlemen, spoke by the
</p>
<p>yard  he lectured us, and spoke like Birbeck, who went to
</p>
<p>Illinois, he too, like Birbeck, may give, if he ever dare to
</p>
<p>return to London, some note of the savage inhabitants. He
</p>
<p>says Handwich was near an empty space Do you believe it ?
</p>
<p>Was it not packed close ? What was Tiernan s evidence of
</p>
<p>it? It was a running hand that all might read. They were
</p>
<p>packed, says Tiernan  there never was such a crush. Which
</p>
<p>do you believe  the thorough Irishman or the Anglo-Irishman
</p>
<p> a seedling grafted on the English stock  possessing all the
</p>
<p>clogged pertinacity of the one, without the frankness of the
</p>
<p>other. We have another  the far-famed Dr. M'Namara, from
</p>
<p>BalHnakill, and Graduate of Salamanca. I heard " mind
</p>
<p>your fire," says the Doctor ; how fortunate is it that a fabri-
</p>
<p>cation is always unsupported, and here there is not the slightest
</p>
<p>corroboration. Moreover, lie says that he recognized the bottle
</p>
<p>in its transit. Transit !  sage astronomer ! Morally speak-
</p>
<p>ing, it is impossible the bottle could have descended without
</p>
<p>being observed by 7 or 800 persons' at least ; but nobody saw
</p>
<p>it but the Doctor; no giggling girl, no telescope could discover
</p>
<p>except that of the astronomer of Ballinakill. Vounders
</p>
<p>upon vounders, says the Dutchman, and here are vounders
</p>
<p>with a vengeance to say that glass, a substance more elastic
</p>
<p>than ivory, and 1000 times as fragible, could fall from such a,
</p>
<p>height unbroken. But here is a miracle indeed ; Mr. Barton,
</p>
<p>who sits in the orchestra, takes up the bottle without getting

</p>
<p>off his seat ; it must have therefore fallen from the pit or
</p>
<p>boxes, the impetus was so slight. But why is not the bottle
</p>
<p>produced; we should then see whether it contained porter or
</p>
<p>whiskey, or whether it was starred? I admit that Forbes, (for
</p>
<p>whom I am not concerned, but whom I think a frank young
</p>
<p>man,) I admit that he 'was intoxicated and intemperate, but I
</p>
<p>deny that he has done any thing criminal. It is a rule of law
</p>
<p>that " mens rea fecit reum," and apply this in the present case.
</p>
<p>But what is the real extent of the gui't of the Traversers if
</p>
<p>guilt itcan be called ? I have always thought it was the privi-
</p>
<p>lege of the English and the Irish to give expression to a public
</p>
<p>feeling. They are not to excite terror in expressing it ; but
</p>
<p>short >f that (I may be wrong). I have always thought they
</p>
<p>had a right to express a public and political feeling. However,
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>if I am to lose this privilege, I will not part with it without a
</p>
<p>struggle. The Attorney General has set Up for a reformer of
</p>
<p>the Theatre (laughter). I hoj>e he will sketch out a plan
</p>
<p>more defined than that of the political Reformers I hope he
</p>
<p>will state how much is to be conceded to the boxeshow much
</p>
<p>to the pit how much to the galleries. I hope it is not the
</p>
<p>presence of the King or the Lord Lieutenai.t that will frown
</p>
<p>the audience into Eastern sycophancy, or silent submission,
</p>
<p>In the classic writers of our language, we shall find examples
</p>
<p>numerous enough, of the exertion of this valued privilege.
</p>
<p>You remember the Trunkmaker in the Spectator you remem-
</p>
<p>ber the history of Cato, written for the purpose of giving vent
</p>
<p>to those " grand swelling sentiments or liberty/' which were
</p>
<p>so opposed to the Tory and intolerant Administration of my
</p>
<p>Lord Bolinbroke, and Treasurer Harley. On this occasion,
</p>
<p>Booth, the actor, who personated the character of Cato, in-
</p>
<p>stead of being rebuked, or an ex'-officio filed against him by my
</p>
<p>Lord Bolinbroke, was taken by that Nobleman into his especial
</p>
<p>favor, and presented with 60 guineas, although Cato had the
</p>
<p>merit of silencing those who aspired to overthrow the reigning
</p>
<p>family, and who wished to assume a perpetual dictatorship
</p>
<p>The Duke of Rutland was gallant, gay, and chivalrous. He
</p>
<p>lived in times when hospitality and profusion were considered
</p>
<p>as manly virtues as indispensible duties. The Noble Duke
</p>
<p>never went to the Theatre without some allusion being made to
</p>
<p>his profligate character, but although insulted he had the grace
</p>
<p>to blush, and the good humour to smile- I assert that the
</p>
<p>privilege of asserting opinions on public subjects was never ex-
</p>
<p>ercise !, even in the most arbitrary times. Even the Ttftdon
</p>
<p>and Elizabeth were innocent of such a crime. Returning from
</p>
<p>her Parliament, after having conquered the Armada, and sub-
</p>
<p>dued the spirit of Spain, Elizabeth was hissed and insu'ted.
</p>
<p>She had a Court of Star Chamber, and an Attorney General
</p>
<p>ready to file his ex officio. To neither of tln.se did she resort ;

<p>she retired to her chamber ; she smote her breast, ad acknow-
</p>
<p>ledged the justice of the sentence of her people. You have all
</p>
<p>heard of the O P riots at Covent Garden. They lasted for six -
</p>
<p>ty-six nights, and were violent in the extreme. When ihe r. ; -
</p>
<p>oters were brought before a British Jury, they found security-
</p>
<p>even against the charges of the Judges, and when pressed by
</p>
<p>Sir James Mansfield to give a verdict tor the King, they Mid
</p>
<p>they did not think it necessary to punish a man lor wearing a-
</p>
<p>placard in his hat. The Attorney General says t!.at yWr ver-
</p>

</p>
<p>on ! Consider well before you suffer 3 our judgment to be ei -
</p>
<p>trapped ; remember that there is not a Bishop or a Secretary

</p>
<p>Gentlemen  The swelling tide of popular feeling will not be

<p>staved the boisterous billow of political contention will not
</p>
<p>be calmed by force. Gentlemen, I witnessed the entry of hit

<p>Gentlemen  Ex- Officios, without bail or mainprize, cannot

</p>
<p>FOURTH DAY Thursday, Feb. 6.
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnston, at the opening of the Court, argued a consi-
</p>
<p>derable length against the proceeding by an information filed
</p>
<p>ex-officio by the Attorney- General, after the Grand Jury had
</p>
<p>ignored bills of indictment, which had been preferred against
</p>
<p>the same persons on the same testimony. After having quoted
</p>
<p>several cases from law books, and other authorities, he re-
</p>
<p>viewed the evidence which had been given against the Traver-
</p>
<p>sers, with his usual ability and zeal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scriven, said, that hewas Council for Brownlow ; one of
</p>
<p>those deep and bloody conspirators, who had been charged
</p>
<p>with the atrocious offence of endeavouring to take away the
</p>
<p>Jife of the Lord Lieutenant; and that it was his duty to enter
</p>
<p>on the defence of his client ; but that after the brilliant and ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary display of eloquence from Mr. North, which the

<p>Court and the Gentlemen of the Jury had witnessed yesterday,
</p>
<p>and after the particular manner in which Mr. Johnston had
</p>
<p>gone through the evidence which had been adduced on the part
</p>
<p>of the Crown, it could not be expected, as indeed it would not
</p>
<p>be allowable, for him to go into any extent of observations on
</p>
<p>the prominent facts of the case. The general topics has been>
</p>
<p>ail exhausted ; the particular facts had been 
</p>
<p>Here .Mr. Scriven was stopped by the Chief Justice, who
</p>
<p>wished to know whether it was the intention of the Law Officer*
</p>
<p>of the Crown to press for a conviction against Brownlow. 
</p>
<p>His Lordship said that the Court had taken into their consi-
</p>
<p>deration all the evidence which had been adduced against him-
</p>
<p>07
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>and had weighed well the testimony which applied to him. It
</p>
<p>appeared that Brownlow was neither at the meeting at the
</p>
<p>Shakespeare Tavern, nor at the meeting in Werburgh-street $
</p>
<p>that he was neither at the buying of the tickets, nor at the
</p>
<p>transactions in the Theatre. The whole of the evidence which
</p>
<p>applied to him only went to the transactions in the Tavern in
</p>
<p>Essex- street. The evidence was, that he sat there with the
</p>
<p>other Traversers. It also appeared that he was rebuked by one
</p>
<p>of them for not having been at his post, and that he defended
</p>
<p>himself by saying, that he was in as good a place for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose, in the pit- That admission, which is the whole of the
</p>
<p>evidence against him *
</p>
<p>He'-e the Attorney General rose, and made a short obser-
</p>
<p>vation.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  We must then leave the question to
</p>
<p>the Jury.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General said  My Lord, under the obser-
</p>
<p>vation which your Lordship has made, I do not think I would
</p>
<p>be justifiable in pressing tor judgment against that individual.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scriven  Then the issue is to be sent at once to the
</p>
<p>Jury, as to Brownlow.
</p>
<p>Ths Attorney General  No, no. no.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scriven  It could not be allowed that I should go into
</p>
<p>his case at any length, and the more particularly, after what has
</p>
<p>fallen from your Lordship ; but I am concerned for another
</p>
<p>traverser.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  We stated in the outset that every
</p>
<p>person should have a full opportunity of availing himself of
</p>
<p>every opportunity for his defence. Air. Johnston has stated
</p>
<p>a case for one of the traversers; Mr. Dnscoll has stated a
</p>
<p>case for two of the traversers ; Mr. North has stated a case
</p>
<p>for two more of them ; there only remains one, whose case
</p>
<p>is to be spoken to  and that is Brownlow's.

</p>
<p>Mr. Scriven  I am concerned.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General interrupted Mr. Scriven by saying,
</p>
<p>that he (toe Attorney General) thought that he was discharg-
</p>
<p>ing his duty in at ceding to th# suggestions of the Court ;
</p>
<p>and that he thought bis acquiescence was not calculated to do
</p>
<p>an injury to Mr. Scriven's client. LL s<iid that if Mr. Scri-
</p>
<p>ven had thought proper U>Joreo his intention of speaking to
</p>
<p>the ease lie, (tne Attorney Genera! ) would have felt it to
</p>
<p>be his duty to abstain in the course of examination of the
</p>
<p>witnesses who might be produced on the defence, from' asking
</p>
<p>any questions which might tend to affect* Brownlow ; but
</p>
<p>thai if Urownlow's Counsel conceived himself to be discharg-
</p>
<p>ing his duty ro his client, he mig'it go on with his speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scriven immediately declared that he would not abuse
</p>
<p>the privilege/ and that he wuuld close biff mouth. He would,
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>C8
</p>
<p>however, take the opportunity of acknowledging the candou?
</p>
<p>of the Attorney General in this part, as well as in the entire
</p>
<p>of the prosecution; he (Mr. Scriven) would not intrude his
</p>
<p>opinions on the Court and the public, though there were
</p>
<p>some topics not touched upon by others, which he would
</p>
<p>otherwise have felt it to be his duty to urge.
</p>
<p>FOR THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Mr. Trench sworn  examined by Mr. Blaclcburne.
</p>
<p>Witness lives at Haywood, near Ballinakill, in the Queen's
</p>
<p>County ; knows Dr. Bernand M'Namara; does nut know much
</p>
<p>of him; he heard of Dr. M'Namara by character; knows Dr.
</p>
<p>M'Namara's general character, as far as his (witness's) judg-
</p>
<p>ment goes ; witness is a magistrate of the Queen's County ;
</p>
<p>knows Dr. M ; Namara's general character ten years ; does not
</p>
<p>know him much; knows him generally. Q. From his general
</p>
<p>character, do you believe him to be worthy of belief on his
</p>
<p>ath ?
</p>
<p>The question was objected to by the Attorney General, and
</p>
<p>after along argument it was settled that the question should
</p>
<p>be put in such a way, as that the answer of the witness should
</p>
<p>state whether it was the general opinion of the county, and
</p>
<p>not merely of any individual in it, that Dr. M'Namara was not
</p>
<p>worthy of belief on his oath.
</p>
<p>Q. Now you have heard the nature of the question, what is
</p>
<p>your answer I I must speak in some degree from my own means
</p>
<p>of knowledge ; I have been a Magistrate for 40 years ; upon
</p>
<p>my oath I would not believe him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Attorney -General.
</p>
<p>I have not been in habits of conversation with Dr. Macnama-
</p>
<p>ra, in general, because I always avoided it, except when he was
</p>
<p>brought before me, or came before me as a Magistrate to take
</p>
<p>his depositions ; I have a dislike to the man from his conduct.
</p>
<p>Did he ever do you an injury ? Never; I have known that per-
</p>
<p>sons lodged informations against him, and he lodged informations

</p>
<p>against those persons ; he is a troublesome litigious man.
</p>
<p>Q. Because he is a troublesome and litigious man, you would
</p>
<p>not believe him on his oath ; is that your meaning Mr^ Trench f
</p>
<p>No. Do you not feel a little warmth on this occasion ? No. Is
</p>
<p>not the impression you have, that he is a litigious, troublesome
</p>
<p>man ? I adhere to my original intention to think that he is not
</p>
<p>a person to be believed on his oath. Dj you mean to say that
</p>
<p>in a matter in which he was disinterested, you would not believe
</p>
<p>him ? I had an  (a pause)  I should be inclined to disbelieve
</p>
<p>him. Only inclined ; then you admit that he might be believ-
</p>
<p>ed on his oath sometimes ? No ; I should absolutely, positively
</p>
<p>disbelieve him on any question. So if he came into Court and
</p>
<p>swore to any matter that was indifferent to him, you would dis-
</p>
<p>believe him  would you t (After a long pause)  1 don't undep.
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>stand the question ; I don't think myself bound to answer the
</p>
<p>question. The question was repeated. On my word 
</p>
<p> 'Mr. Attorney General here reminded Mr. Trench that he was
</p>
<p>on his oath. On my oath I should strongly hesitate, if I did
</p>
<p>not decline to believe his evidence. You said a while ago that
</p>
<p>you would absolutely and positively disbelieve him  what do
</p>
<p>you say now? I would absolutely disbelieve him. Without any
</p>
<p>qualification? No, no. Well! what do you say now ? I would
</p>
<p>actually and absolutely disbelieve him. Suppose he came in to
</p>
<p>swear that he was in the Theatre, on Saturday night, you would
</p>
<p>absolutely believe that he was not in the Theatre, but that he
</p>
<p>was in Ballinakill pound? (Laugh). Would you Mr. Trench ?
</p>
<p>I would not absolutely, but I would believe nothing from him
</p>
<p>unless it was confirmed by a person of veracity. It must de-
</p>
<p>pend in a great deal if he had an interest. Then, if he had no
</p>
<p>interest you would believe him ; would you i Not absolutely.
</p>
<p>Suppose the thing was indifferent, would you believe him ? I
</p>
<p>could not say that I would disbelieve every thing. (A laugh).
</p>
<p>Attorney General  We are here getting into a little state of em-
</p>
<p>barrassment; we must understand the articles of your belief in
</p>
<p>Dr. Macnamara  (a laugh) ; we must understand your ortho-
</p>
<p>doxy (a laugh) ; I am afraid you are wavering in our be-
</p>
<p>lief  (a laugh). If he said he saw the Lord Lieutenant, you
</p>
<p>would disbelieve him, (After a long pause) I would not say.
</p>
<p>Suppose that he said that he was at the playhouse, would you
</p>
<p>believe him? I might or I might not believe him (a laugh).
</p>
<p>You have said more than once, that you absolutely and positive-
</p>
<p>ly disbelieve him on all occasions. You said again, that you
</p>
<p>might believe him or not ; then I believe that we must leave
</p>
<p>you to the Jury, like him, to say whether you ought or not be
</p>
<p>credited ; (a laugh) ? I speak only from his general character.
</p>
<p>Did you ever hear of a charge of perjury being preferred against
</p>
<p>him in the country ? (After a long pause). A person who is a
</p>
<p>Barrister, Counseller Arabin, if he was here, he could tell it.

</p>
<p>P Attorney- General. Never mind Counsellor Arabin, we
</p>
<p>shall have him called, and he will answer for himself.
</p>
<p>The question was repeated. Witness  I beg leave to call
</p>
<p>Counselor Arabin.
</p>
<p>Attorney- General  We will hare him called, but go on
</p>
<p>yourself, and he will state what he knows for himself.
</p>
<p>Witness  Sitting on the bench as a Magistrate, something
</p>
<p>came under our observation, but Counsellor Arabin can ex-
</p>
<p>plain it better than I can. Q. Never mind Counsellor Arabin,
</p>
<p>tell what you do know ? There was no charge, but there is a
</p>
<p>preparation for a charge of perjury against him. Then I am
</p>
<p>to understand that something growing out of that transaction
</p>
<p>has been added to your impression against Doctor M'Namara?
</p>
<p>No answer.
</p>
<p>Attorney- General  If Mr. Arabia be produced I shall
</p>
<p>prove to the satisfaction of the Court and Jury, that there
</p>
<p>never was a more unfounded imputation than this In answer
</p>
<p>to a question proposed by the Court, the witness said that there
</p>
<p>was no prosesution, but that th*re was cue in preparation.
</p>
<p>Question by the Attorney Genera)*  Is Mr. Arabinin town?
</p>
<p>I don't know. Has not Dr. M Namara frequently appeared be-
</p>
<p>fore you in the character of a prosecutor? He has. Has lie
</p>
<p>tendered informations to you? He has. Has he sworn to
</p>
<p>them? He has. Dj you believe him to be a warm man, and
</p>
<p>that he has enemies in the Country ? I believe he lias. Upon
</p>
<p>your oath, has he not many enemies in the County, who would
</p>
<p>be glad to convict him of perjury, if he swore falsely ? There
</p>
<p>are many persons, and I would be glad to convict him myself
</p>
<p>if he swore falsely. Would they not be desirous ? Upon my
</p>
<p>word I don't know whether they would be desirous to convict
</p>
<p>him of perjury. I suppose the people he swore against would
</p>
<p>be desirous or convicting him of perjury ? No answer. I
</p>
<p>wish to ask you a few questions about Ballinakill pound. He
</p>
<p>was indicced for breaking the pound, and rescuing cattle. 
</p>
<p>Upon your oath, did not the facts of the case appear before
</p>
<p>the Magistrates to be these ; has not Mr.Arabin some property
</p>
<p>in the Co. ? I don't know, he has some claim in property. Is
</p>
<p>not Dr. Macnamara in the possession of some property in the
</p>
<p>County ? I can't exactly say, at least he claims the possession
</p>
<p>of some property. I ask you Sir, is he not in actual posses-
</p>
<p>sion of some property ? I believe he is in possession of some
</p>
<p>leasehold interest.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General.  Was ever the like of this seen , I ask
</p>
<p>you, if Dr. Macnamara is in possession of a certain property,
</p>
<p>and then, you tell me that Dr. Macnamara has a claim to the
</p>
<p>possession  w r hatkind of possession, is a claim to possession ?
</p>
<p>and then when I press for an answer, to know whether the man
</p>
<p>is oris not in possession, you tell me that it is a leasehold pro-
</p>
<p>perty ! I did not ask whether it was a fee simple, or a fee tail.

</p>
<p>or a quasi fee simple, or a freehold, or what denomination of
</p>
<p>property it is ; and yet you tell me that, it is a leasehold,
</p>
<p>though you did not say to me at once who was in possession of
</p>
<p>it, which was what 1 asked and all I wanted to know. Q. Are
</p>
<p>there any tenants holding under him? He is in possession of
</p>
<p>a leasehold interest. There again  the quality of the tenure !
</p>
<p>1 ask you, Sir, has he any tenants under him  don't be fen-
</p>
<p>cing with me. Was there not some question raised with respect
</p>
<p>to cattle on the land that had been held by Dr. M'Xamara ?
</p>
<p>There was. Was it not respecting the cattle he was convicted ?
</p>
<p>No answer. Did you not tell me a while ago that he was con-
</p>
<p>victed of breaking the pound and for a rescue of the cattle ?
</p>
<p>A pause. Did you not tell me so ? Let me think. I ask you
</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>was he not tried for a rescue ? I believe he was. A rescue of:
</p>
<p>cattle ? A breach of pound. Was it for breaking open the
</p>
<p>pound, or for taking the cattle? It was for both. Was it not
</p>
<p>for taking cattle from the pound that had been on that very
</p>
<p>land ; Was it not for taking cattle that were upon that land
</p>
<p>that were driven by Macnamara himself for rent, before any
</p>
<p>rent became due to him ? 1 believe it was. Did he not take
</p>
<p>the cattle off the land before the rent was due and put them
</p>
<p>into pound ; to pursue this transaction would be getting into a
</p>
<p>detail much too long? I brieve it was. Don't you believe
</p>
<p>that he took the cattle out of the pound himself when he
</p>
<p>found that the distress was illegal?
</p>
<p>Witness  Give leave to state.
</p>
<p>Attorney General  No, no.
</p>
<p>Hoc Age  Give me an answer.
</p>
<p>Witness  Before 1 answer let me give you a reason.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  First answer the question, and then give a
</p>
<p>reason.
</p>
<p>Witness  I believe he broke open the pound, but there
</p>
<p>was a detainer lodged against the cattle. Q. What! what do
</p>
<p>you mean by a detainer given to a pound-keeper ; I don't un-
</p>
<p>derstand how that is done ; this is a new branch of jurispru-
</p>
<p>dence to me. ( A loud laugh. ) What is the form of lodging
</p>
<p>the detainer on the cattle in the pound ; for I for one. don't
</p>
<p>understand how that can be done, (a laugh) ; 1 wiah to be
</p>
<p>enlightened I y the local authorities. (A laugh.)
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Trench became faint, and he called for a gla^s
</p>
<p>of water; when he recovered a little, the Attorney Genera!
</p>
<p>said to him will you have this orange, though I don't mean
</p>
<p>to insinuate by it that you are of that complexion? (A loud
</p>
<p>laugh in every part of the Court.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Trench shortly afterwards holding out towards Mr.
</p>
<p>Attorney General a bit of the Peel of the orange, said, give
</p>
<p>me leave to present to you, in return, some of an old acquaint-

</p>
<p>ance, (loud laughing and cheering in the Court.)
</p>
<p>Cross-examinaiion resumed*
</p>
<p>W r ho lodged the detainer ? I believe some creditor of the
</p>
<p>tenant. The cattle were the cattle of the tenant, and some
</p>
<p>detainer was lodged with the pound-keeper, and Dr. M'&a-
</p>
<p>mara took away the cattle which he himself had impounded?
</p>
<p>was not these the facts ? Yes. Was the pound on the land
</p>
<p>or off the land of Dr. M'Namara? It was not on the land of
</p>
<p>Dr. M'Namara. The pound breach, of which you and the
</p>
<p>Magistrates convicted him, was for taking out of the pound
</p>
<p>the cattle which he himself put in the pound, which was not
</p>
<p>on the premises ? It was. Did you convict him and impose
</p>
<p>a fine of 20. for that ? Yes ; there were other matters too,
</p>
<p>What were they ? Stay, I have not in fact a sufficient recoi*
</p>
<p>lection of them, and I want to thipjj. a littj^.
</p>
<p>Here the Attorney General rose and said that the decision
</p>
<p>was as gross and illegal a decision as ever was made in the
</p>
<p>course of time, and that he could not conceive any thing
</p>
<p>more abominable.
</p>
<p>Don t you believe that Dr. M Namara was sentenced to
</p>
<p>three months imprisonment on that occasion ? ( A lon^ pause.)
</p>
<p>1 am thinking there were a great many cases tried at the
</p>
<p>time, and as I have not a perfect memory, I am endeavour-
</p>
<p>ing to recollect myself.
</p>
<p>Attorney General  Don't hurry yourself. Don't you be-
</p>
<p>lieve he wa6 sentenced to pay a fine of 20. and to be im-
</p>
<p>prisoned three months? That was the sentence- Don't you
</p>
<p>believe that this circumstance joined to the other general
</p>
<p>circumstances, made an impression on your mind, not to be-
</p>
<p>lieve t-ie gentleman on his oath ? (After along pause) There
</p>
<p>is a train of circumstances not connected with that, that made
</p>
<p>such impression on my mind. You did advert to one circum-
</p>
<p>stance, and I have unravelled it. If I should ask you about
</p>
<p>other matters, you might enter into an explanation of cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances ; but until I shall do so, you must not tell those
</p>
<p>circumstances. You did mention one circumstance, and as
</p>
<p>I have happened to know something about it, 1 adverted to it,
</p>
<p>and showed what the facts were. You might allude to others,
</p>
<p>of which I could have no immediate knowledge, the circum-
</p>
<p>stance might be of the same kind as the facts for which the
</p>
<p>sentence of three months imprisonment, with the fine of 20 f
</p>
<p>was pronounced.
</p>
<p>When Mr. Trench was leaving the table, Mr. Attorney
</p>
<p>General said, 1 shall keep this (the peel) careful ly  r-( A
</p>
<p>laugh.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Trench. I hope you will not want it long, (laugh.)

<p>supped there ; witness can't say the number of persons who
</p>
<p>supped there that night ; witness sat within eight feet of the
</p>
<p>box in which Forbes supped ; saw two gentlemen of the name
</p>
<p>cf Farley and Troy in the box opposite where Forbes sat ; For-
</p>
<p>bes and his party were talking loudj Forbes was greatly irrita-

<p>ted ; witness wished to hear about the Theatre, and he listened
</p>
<p>to what was said; Forbes did not appear to be sober; to the
</p>
<p>best of witness's recollection, he never heard Forbes say of the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant, the Devil help him, or the Devil mend him ;
</p>
<p>witness heard Forbes say, that no true Orangeman would

<p>throw ths rattle o  bottle.

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Solicitor General.
</p>
<p>Many expressions might have escaped witness's notice, as he
</p>
<p>was in conversation occasionally with his own party ; Mr. Far-
</p>
<p>ley and Mr. Troy were more opposite than witness to P'orbes's

<p>which was thrown ; heard him say, that wherever the person
</p>
<p>was who threw the bottle, he was no true Protestant ; he said,
</p>
<p>we have many bad Protestants among us ; and that he was no
</p>
<p>Protestant that threw it.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lefroy.
</p>
<p>Witness saw Forbes, Graham and M'Cullagh come in nearly
</p>
<p>together; has no recollection of the two Atkinson's being
</p>
<p>there. Who else was there ? No answer. Repeat the names ?
</p>
<p>Those are all I recollect ; When Forbes came in he called for
</p>
<p>punch; Forbes was in an irritable state when he came in ; he
</p>
<p>said, that it was a pretty thing that he should be brought to a
</p>
<p>police-office, and that John Fleming should have known his
</p>
<p>( Forbes s) father better than to put him in a watch-house?
</p>
<p>I)id they talk about the bottle, or about the rattle, or about

</p>
<p>the sticks ? I don't recollect any thing about the rattle, or the
</p>
<p>sticks, but about the bottle ; witness was in the Theatre that
</p>
<p>n'ght in the pit ; he went by himself ; witness left the Theatre
</p>
<p>after the whole performance was over ; witness is quite sure
</p>
<p>that he did not quit the Theatre till the whole performance
</p>
<p>was over ; witness was not in company with William Graham,
</p>
<p>but he met at the pit door when he was going in ; did net
</p>
<p>see William Graham in the house. What is the number of
</p>
<p>your Lodge ? 16l\2. That is Graham's Lodge ? No. At-
</p>
<p>kinson's Lodge ? Yes. When did you last attend that
</p>
<p>Lodge ? Not thsoe six months. Were you in Daly's, in
</p>
<p>Werburgh-street, the week before that night? A pause I
</p>
<p>can't say ; I have no recollection. Then you say you were not 7
</p>
<p>I don't say I was not ; I might have becu there. Try, recol-
</p>
<p>U
</p>
<p>lect distinctly ; what time of the day was it; morning or eve-
</p>
<p>ning, that you were there ? I was never in the habit of going
</p>
<p>in the day ; it was in the evening. When the Lodge is over
</p>
<p>do not they sup together? No, only on particular nights
</p>
<p>when a purple Lodge is held, which happens only quarterly ;
</p>
<p>I did not sua at Daly's one night in that week. Have you
</p>
<p>supped there lately ? I might have supped there. Whom did
</p>
<p>you meet there the last time you were there, before the
</p>
<p>Theatre night ? I can't recollect'. Perhaps I might help you
</p>
<p>Did you see Forbes ; I might ; I can't recollect. Did you
</p>
<p>see Graham ? I don't recollect ; I can't recollect and parti-
</p>
<p>cular person. Did you see any particular person ; you told
</p>
<p>me you were in the habit of going there constantly? I can't
</p>
<p>recollect. Did you hear any thing about a subscription ? I did.
</p>
<p>I heard it rumoured.
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoil objected to this as not being legal evidence.
</p>
<p>The Court said there was a mode of putting the question,
</p>
<p>and they disallowed the answer.
</p>
<p>Did you hear from any of the members of the Lodge any
</p>
<p>thing about the subscription
</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoil objected to the question, and the Court over-
</p>
<p>ruled it.
</p>
<p>Do you know any thing of the subscription ; had you any
</p>
<p>conversation with Forbes, M'Cullagh, or Atkinson on the
</p>
<p>guoject? I don't know one I had a conversation with on
</p>
<p>the subject.
</p>
<p>The Court to Mr. Driscoil Your observation with respect
</p>
<p>to Atkinson is not well founded ; we apprehend it to be
</p>
<p>evidence of a furtherance of a design.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pen-in quoted a book in support of Mr Driscoil.
</p>
<p>The question, however, was put again, and the witness
</p>
<p>said that he did not hear it from Forbes, Graham, or M'Cul-
</p>
<p>lagh. Witness heard several speak of their intention to go
</p>
<p>to the Theatre ; he knew nothing of the intention of the

</p>
<p>men going to the Theatre. Do you say that you were a
</p>
<p>stranger to their intention to go to the Theatre ? ( A long
</p>
<p>argument ensued between the Counsel, about the using of the
</p>
<p>word stranger in the question, it was at last withdrawn.) 
</p>
<p>"Witness did not go to the Theatre until after eight o'clock
</p>
<p>on that night. What was the nature of the placards you
</p>
<p>saw in the Theatre? It was about the " Morning-tone."
</p>
<p>Did that mean the Lord Mayor? I don't know; it might
</p>
<p>mean the Lord Mavor for aught I know. ( A strong sensation
</p>
<p>was manifested in the Court.) When you read that placard
</p>
<p>you did not apply it to any person ? I do not recollect the
</p>
<p>words; I did not know what it applied to. To whom did
</p>
<p>you in your own mind apply it & I don't know ; if I saw a
</p>
<p>copy of it I might be aoie to form an opinion.  .
</p>
<p>75
</p>
<p>Here one of the handbills was given to the witness, who read
</p>
<p>it ; it was as follows.
</p>
<p>" The Ex-Governor of the Bantams must change his Morn-
</p>
<p>ing ton-e." The witness pronounced the last words, as if writ-
</p>
<p>ten " Mornington."
</p>
<p> Witness in continuation. At first I did not know to whom it
</p>
<p>applied, but I asked and I was told by others that it alluded to
</p>
<p>the Lord Lieutenant. Have you any doubt about it ? No ; from
</p>
<p>what I hear. You said that Forbes's party first called for punch
</p>
<p>and after an interval, that they called for supper, how many
</p>
<p>were together ? About five. Did they sup in the same box?
</p>
<p>They all supped together.
</p>
<p>Question by the Court. What do you mean by supping in
</p>
<p>the snrne box ? I mean they supped together. I asked you did
</p>
<p>they not call for punch first, and then, whether they supped
</p>
<p>afterwards ? They all supped in the same box. How nearly
</p>
<p>opposite to the box in wbieh they supped were you ? They sat
</p>
<p>in the direction of that corner to me. Did you see Farley and
</p>
<p>Troy? Not until they were going out; they sat in the op : o&Xd
</p>
<p>box to Forbes's box, and I sat in the next box with my face to
</p>
<p>them. Did you see them remain at supper f I did. Did you see
</p>
<p>the cloth taken away ? I did. But were Troy and Farley oppo-
</p>
<p>site to them at supper ? They were. Was it while they were
</p>
<p>at supper, or after, that the expressions were uttered ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Question by a Juror. Did you see Forbes and Graham in
</p>
<p>the same box the whole night ? They did not leave it the whole
</p>
<p>night; I was there before they came in, and after they went out.
</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Broad, sworn.
</p>
<p>Witness is prompter at the Theatre ; witness gave a plan of
</p>
<p>the Theatre to the Crown Solicitor ; witness recollects Michael
</p>
<p>Farrell's going to the Theatre when witness was about making
</p>
<p>that plan ; Farrell pointed out to witness the situation in which
</p>
<p>he said Handwich stood, in the centre of the two pilasters of

<p>pilasters in the one shilling gallery ; witness said that the spac*
</p>
<p>between where Handwich stood, and the extremity, was equal
</p>
<p>to the one-fifth, and the one-half of a fifth of the entire seat ;he
</p>
<p>could not tell how many feet were in the space, for he had ne-
</p>
<p>ver measured the distance between the pilasters ; witness said
</p>
<p>that the height of the parapet} in the front of the upper gal-
</p>
<p>lery, was between one foot and two feet, but he could not say
</p>
<p>exactly, be would not swear it is two ; the parapet would reach
</p>
<p>as high as the middle of a man's thi<rh when standing ; there
</p>
<p>are five seats in the middle gallery in front of the parapet of the
</p>
<p>upper galley ; if a plumb line were dropped from the parapet,
</p>
<p>it would tou^hthe sixth seat.
</p>
<p>Lady Kossmore, sworn. Examined by Mr. Driscoll.
</p>
<p>Her Ladyship sat in the box next to the Lord L k utenant in
</p>
<p>the Theatre, on the night of the 14th December last ; sheheald
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>a great deal of noise, but did not feel the least alarm ; (Toad
</p>
<p>laughing in every part of the Court, in which her Ladyship join-
</p>
<p>ed most heartily). Her Ladyship was in the second row, on
</p>
<p>that side of the box 'furthest from the Lord Lieutenant ; she did
</p>
<p>not perceive a bottle thrown, as her sight is grown imperfect;
</p>
<p>her Ladyship could scarcely say that she saw a stick or some-
</p>
<p>thing thrown at the Lord Lieutenant's box : whatever it was
</p>
<p>her Lady .ship was not alarmed at it in the slightest degree  (a
</p>
<p>loud laugh); the noise was trifling; her Ladyship explained
</p>
<p>this part oi^ her evidence by saying, that the noise of the stick
</p>
<p>when it hit the cushion, was slight : her Ladyship often heard
</p>
<p>a great deal of noise whenever there was a crowded house, but
</p>
<p>as her hearing is imperfect, she can't say whether she heard a
</p>
<p>greater noise than on that night.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Torrens*
</p>
<p>Lady Anne Gregory sat next to the Lord Lieutenant, and
</p>
<p>Miss Gregory next to witness ; both had a much better oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of seeing what occurred than witness; witness thought
</p>
<p>she saw something flit before her eyes ; her attention was attract-
</p>
<p>ed to it by Miss Goulburn's starting; it fell on the next box;
</p>
<p>witness supposed it fell in her own box; it struck the cushion ;
</p>
<p>her memory is decayed, and she can't recollect the time when it
</p>
<p>struck the cushion ; Mrs. Goulburn was much alarmed. Vv hat
</p>
<p>effect had it en Miss Gregory? As far as I could see, not the
</p>
<p>least. Her Ladyship did not see Captain Webster send out for
</p>
<p>wine and water for -diss Gregory; has no recollection that La*
</p>
<p>dy Anne Gregory was alarmed.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General desired that Captain Webster might be
</p>
<p>called, to prove that he sent for wine and water for Miss Grego-
</p>
<p>ry, who had been fainting.
</p>
<p>James Henry Btocas, examined by Mr. Spear.
</p>
<p>He was in the upper gallery the night in question. Saw
</p>
<p>Henry Kandwich in the left hand side of the upper gallery, 5
</p>
<p>or 6' yards from the end; should think he sat on the second bench

</p>
<p>from the front of the gallery saw a large stick and no bot-
</p>
<p>tle in his hand : w r as distant from him only 7 paces ; witness
</p>
<p>sat on the third bench : if he had stood up and thrown any thing
</p>
<p>imquestionaliy he must have seen him, to the best of his belief
</p>
<p>it was impossible without having been observed by him ; there
</p>
<p>was no vacant places ; witness was squeezed exceedingly.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Attorney General.
</p>
<p>Went to the gallery about a quarter before stven, got in
</p>
<p>with difficulty ; made way to the third row ; thinks it a dozen
</p>
<p>paces from the centre to the extremity of the gallery ; Henry
</p>
<p>Handwich attracted his attention immediately after the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the play, by calling out, " God save the King,"
</p>
<p>and M song, song;" he kept his eye on him almost incessantly
</p>
<p>the entire evening ; got a glimpse of Mr. Liston ; saw the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant very imperfectly ; kept looking at Henry
</p>
<p>Handwich, because he could see nothing else ; Handwich and
</p>
<p>man}' c thers in the gallery joined in the chorus ; Henry
</p>
<p>Handwich roars most vociferously, (roars of laughter) ; heaid
</p>
<p>the u Boyne Water. ' Cl the Memory," and M Down with
</p>
<p>Ribbonmen," incessantly, that is, witness means very fre-
</p>
<p>quently ; heard clown with the Papists ; the party abused the
</p>
<p>Pope a good deal ; a man gives a toast who haci a bottle, that
</p>
<p>toast was, M Here's the Pope, bad luck to him, and all that
</p>
<p>wish him well." Popish Wellesley he is rather di^p.ised to
</p>
<p>think applied to the Lord Lieutenant. (Laughter.) Thinks lie
</p>
<p>heard a groan for the Lord Lieutenant; is positive that meant
</p>
<p>Lord Wellesley ; on his oath he does not believe there was a
</p>
<p>bottle thrown that night ; there were no women in the gallery ;
</p>
<p>he therefore thinks the rattle was thrown by a man or a boy ;
</p>
<p>never said to Alderman Darley, when he arrested Handwich,
</p>
<p>you have arrested an innocent man ; heard no talk of any
</p>
<p>bottle being thrown when Alderman Darley came into the
</p>
<p>gailery ; heard many crying from the gallery, that is another
</p>
<p>calf's head plot ; witness was sure no Orangeman ever threw
</p>
<p>that bottle
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  Did you ever say when pointing to
</p>
<p>Handwich, there's the villain who threw the bottle ; never
</p>
<p>knew a person named M'Can ; had a conversation with him,
</p>
<p>but not with respect to the bottle ; said outside the Police
</p>
<p>Office that the principal disturber was in custody, come in, I'll
</p>
<p>point him out ; for unquestionably he was the most noisy and
</p>
<p>troublesome man he ever^ laid Ins eyes on. (Laughter.) 
</p>
<p>Handwich, the witness swore, never left his place the entire
</p>
<p>night; knows Mr. Gunning ; M'Can said he had played cards
</p>
<p>with the Lord Mayor; spoke to Mr. Gunning about what had
</p>
<p>passed in the Theatre ; he said Lord Wellesley had drawn his
</p>
<p>sword in the Theatre, and witness believes that is false.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General  Did you say to Mr. Gunning that
</p>
<p>you could almost prove the throwing of the bottie ? Never*

<p>Did you say to Mr. M'Can, there's the man who threw the
</p>
<p>bottle, pointing to Handwich ? Never. Never heard look
</p>
<p>out boys, exclaimed in the gallery ? The Police were not
</p>
<p>on the alert sufficiently to prevent noise, but exerted them-
</p>
<p>selves to aid Alderman Darley.
</p>
<p>The Counsel for the traversers offered as evidence, a copy
</p>
<p>of the bills of indictment, which had been ignored by the late
</p>
<p>Commission Grand Jury. The Court declared it to be inad-
</p>
<p>missible as evidence.
</p>
<p>Here the ca?e on behalf of the traversers was closed, when
</p>
<p>Mr. Attorney General said, that as it was so late, lie hoped
</p>
<p>that the Bench would not expect the Solicitor General to
</p>
<p>{peak to evidence until the next day.
</p>
<p>The Judges, after a short consultation said, that they could
</p>
<p>not comply with the wish of the Attorney General, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of the great pressure of the pubic business, and on
</p>
<p>account of the great portion of time which the trial had al-
</p>
<p>ready occupied. There were several cases which were in-
</p>
<p>tended for trial, but whieh it was doubtful whether they could
</p>
<p>be brought to an issue at the expected time. There was ano-
</p>
<p>ther consideration for refusing to comply with the request,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as the Court could not think of adjourning at an
</p>
<p>earlier hour on that day, than on any former day; but they
</p>
<p>would, for the purpose of accommodating the Solicitor Gene-
</p>
<p>ral let him go on with a part of his speech this day, and
</p>
<p>allow him to resume it on the following day.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General rose, and addressed the Court
</p>
<p>to the following effect : 
</p>
<p>He could have wished it had suited the convenience of the
</p>
<p>public to defer the addressing their Lordships and the Jury, till
</p>
<p>the next day; he should, however, yield to the wishes of the
</p>
<p>Court, though at that moment ill prepared for reviewing the
</p>
<p>evidence, and replying to the ingenious and eloquent addresses
</p>
<p>of his Learned Friends who had spoken for the Traversers.
</p>
<p>He congratulated the Court and Jury on the approaching con-
</p>
<p>clusion of a trial, as interesting and important as had, perhaps,
</p>
<p>ever occupied that Court  a trial which concerns the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, the wishes of his Majesty, and the injunctions of his
</p>
<p>Majesty's entire Council ; and here he would take this oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of disabusing the public mind from an impression, that
</p>
<p>the institution of this proceeding had been the single act of any
</p>
<p>individual, by telling them it had been the in obedience to the
</p>
<p>unanimous wishes of the British Cabinet. He thought it right
</p>
<p>in the outset to declare thus much, because for some tinrfe past,
</p>
<p>his much respected and Learned Colleague had been loaded
</p>
<p>with obloquy, and the exalted and*distinguished individual at
</p>
<p>the head of the Irish Government vilified and traduced, and
</p>
<p>that engine whose power should contribute to the promotion of

</p>
<p>morality, protection of our liberties, and increase of our in-
</p>
<p>tellectual delights, had been used to insult and wound the
</p>
<p>feelings of its venerable supporter, and liberal patron, owing
</p>
<p>to the present proceedings. But, Gentlemen, it is right this
</p>
<p>transaction should be investigated; as good subjects and peace-
</p>
<p>able citizens, you must all have felt the necessity of inquiry,
</p>
<p>and that the nature and extent of the offence should be ascer-
</p>
<p>tained and proclaimed, that justice should be dealt out, the
</p>
<p>guilty brought to punishment, and the innocent relieved from
</p>
<p>the odium which the crime has attached to a country, where of
</p>
<p>all others it is most indignantly abhorred. Under this convic-
</p>
<p>ton the law officers (with whom he was not only associated,
</p>
<p>bur, identified with his Learned Friend the Attorney -General)
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>determined to bring the matter before the competent tribural.
</p>
<p>Whether they done their duty efTectualry, it was not for him to
</p>
<p>say, but that they had discharged it honestly, they would con-
</p>
<p>fidently appeal to that public, whose opinions became valuable
</p>
<p>when reason should resume the seat now occupied by passion
</p>
<p>and prejudice. That the present proceedings had been by some
</p>
<p>arraigned as unconstitutional, he was not surprised; but he
</p>
<p>confessed he was more surprised to hear it arraigned in th^t
</p>
<p>Court, and by men high in character for legal knowledge and
</p>
<p>ability. There is no proceeding better known to the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, or sanctioned bv time, as a part of our criminal juris-
</p>
<p>prudence When they say there is a difference between an ej~
</p>
<p>officio filed after a Bill had been ignored, they speak rashly, or
</p>
<p>at least they do not speak what they think. Mr. Johnston h.n
</p>
<p>happened to adduce those caes for our defeat, which I meant
</p>
<p>to apply as our support. Sir JVI. Hale, he tells you, says it is
</p>
<p>the safest way *o proceed by indictment ; but he does not t H
</p>
<p>you it is the only legal way upon a criminal information, for
</p>
<p>Sir M. Hale himself obtained informations, and pronounced
</p>
<p>judgment in such cases. The next author he quotes is Black-
</p>
<p>stone, whom he tells you speaks oS criminal informations thus :
</p>
<p>f* This great power was originally reserved in the British Con-
</p>
<p>stitution for the errors and mistakes of Grand Juries, for it is
</p>
<p>the great plan of the British Constitution, that every evil
</p>
<p>shall have a corrective provided for it, so that the errors and
</p>
<p>mistakes of Grand Juries, are provided for by the granting
</p>
<p>of Criminal Informations." This exercise of criminal infor-
</p>
<p>mations, never extends to where the life is at stake, but to such
</p>
<p>offences in which the passions of them are apt to carry them ~
</p>
<p>it is on these lesser ottenees provided in order to guard aeainst
</p>
<p>any improper interruption of justice on the part of the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury. There were originally two Judical Officers, known to
</p>
<p>the law  the one the Master of the Crown Office, and the
</p>
<p>other City Governor, by whom criminal matters were tried and

<p>determined. These powers enjoyed by those Judical Officers
</p>
<p>were afterwards concentrated and rested ia this high Court*
</p>
<p>and the power they now vilify, the King only enjoys in com-
</p>
<p>mon with the meanest of his subjects ; who, it they corns
</p>
<p>forward and can make out a case, this Court is ever ready to
</p>
<p>exercise its great powers in granting them redress. A criminal
</p>
<p>information was a matter of kindness to the parties, granting
</p>
<p>them an early trial, and time to plead  and if convicted, they
</p>
<p>have time allowed by the Court, before judgment, in which
</p>
<p>they may be heard by their Counsel in mitigation. When the
</p>
<p>powers of the two Judical Officers he mnntioned were res*
</p>
<p>trained, that of filing a criminal information, was left by the
</p>
<p>common law in his Majesty's Attorney-General, and he is an-
</p>
<p>swerable for any unsound exercise ef that privilege. The At-

<p>go
</p>
<p>torney -General having this discretionary power, if he should
</p>
<p>apply to the Court of King's Bench for a criminal information,
</p>
<p>the Court would say  if you think this is a case requiring a
</p>
<p>criminal [information, you have the power vested in you [ez~
</p>
<p>rfficio) to file it yourself; we will not therefore interfere with
</p>
<p>your prerogative  and if the Attorney-General (in whom only

<p>the power ties ) had not filed this information, but he (the So-
</p>
<p>licitor-General) came into Court and applied for it, the Court
</p>
<p>would have immediately granted it, on the grounds that he had
</p>
<p>applied to the ordinary tribunal, the Grand Jury, whose door
</p>
<p>was shut against him; and in order that justice should not be
</p>
<p>defeated, his application would have been acceded to. And is
</p>
<p>it not therefore a monstrous proposition, that a relief which this
</p>
<p>Court would have granted to the Solicitor-General, or any
</p>
<p>other subject, mustjbe refused the King in the person of his
</p>
<p>Attorney-General Indeed he could hardly think the Learned
</p>
<p>Counsel serious when he used so extraordinary an argument
</p>
<p>for inducing this Court to refuse entertaining a criminal infor-
</p>
<p>mation, merely because a Grand Jury had not found the Bills.
</p>
<p>"Why these are the very grounds upon which the Court of
</p>
<p>King's Bench acts and exercises its high prerogative. The
</p>
<p>Court would first inquire if the ordinary tribunal had been re-
</p>
<p>sorted to, and finding it had but without effect, it would then
</p>
<p>grant the informations in order to punish crime by the only way
</p>
<p>left. It was not his wish to advert at all, if it could be avoided,
</p>
<p>to the Grand Jury who ignored the Bills ; but if ever there
</p>
<p>was a case for sending men to trial, it was this case. He was
</p>
<p>called upon to make these observations reluctantly, because
</p>
<p>they have relied on the ignoring as affording them an argument
</p>
<p>to throw up to the Jury box as a defence. A witness cross-
</p>
<p>examined by the other side said, that he was before the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury on the present subject, and was asked two questions, and
</p>
<p>there as he was about to tell them what he knew, they shut him
</p>
<p>out, and told him that he had slated .enough ; and yet it is that

</p>
<p>conduct they would wish brought forward here as a defence for
</p>
<p>individuals connected with it; but they knew perfectly well
</p>
<p>why they did so, and their object was that it might serve as a
</p>
<p>beacon to be followed by the Jury he was then addressing. 
</p>
<p>But he trusted the Gentlemen knew their duty, and would
</p>
<p>perform it. He did not care if ever}' man on the Jury was
</p>
<p>an Orangeman; for if he heard their ob'igation tru-y, as bla-
</p>
<p>zoned forth by the examination for the defence, it is to aid the
</p>
<p>administration of justice, not to obstruct it  to enforce, not to
</p>
<p>oppose, the execution of the laws. If there were any associa-
</p>
<p>tions he had alluded to upon the Jury, he conjured them not to
</p>
<p>surfer party piejudice to operate against the faithful discharge
</p>
<p>of that sacred obligation made to their God and tiieir Country.
</p>
<p>This was a prosecution carried on for the purpose of bring-
</p>
<p>in- to justice tlie persons who have committed the outrage of
</p>
<p>81'
</p>
<p>which the people of Ireland had so unanimously and indig-.
</p>
<p>nantly declared their abhorrence. It does not affect their
</p>
<p>lives, but subjects their persons to the discretionary punish-
</p>
<p>ment of" tli is Court, and one advantage the Defendants have
</p>
<p>in this mode of proceeding, there is a day appointed for them
</p>
<p>to receive judgment, and affording them an opportunity of
</p>
<p>being heard in mitigation  and these are advantages they do-
</p>
<p>not possess by the ordinary mode of proceeding. The Jury
</p>
<p>had heard from the opening of the case, that it was an infor-
</p>
<p>mation containing several counts, charging the traversers
</p>
<p>with having concerted and agreed together to do the acts
</p>
<p>charged in the informations, namely, to groan and hiss the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant, and to assault his person. There was .
</p>
<p>another information perfectly distinct, charging that the tra-
</p>
<p>versers did conspire and agree together unlawfully, and ri-
</p>
<p>otously, and there did make and procure, and cause a great
</p>
<p>noise and confusion while the Lord Lieutenant was there ;
</p>
<p>and in another count of the same indictment, that they con-
</p>
<p>spired to insult, and did insult and assail the Lord Lieute-
</p>
<p>nant ; and here he should beg to call their attention to the
</p>
<p>case, with reference to the different counts. Their Lordships
</p>
<p>would tell them, that if any one of the counts was proved, the
</p>
<p>general charge in the information would be established, as in
</p>
<p>the case of Hunt, 2d Campbell. This was an information for
</p>
<p>a libel In a Newspaper, and where the prosecutor was unable
</p>
<p>to prove the composing the libel as stated in one count, it
</p>
<p>was decided that proving the publishing was sufficient, as it
</p>
<p>is invariably enough to prove his having committed any one
</p>
<p>of the crimes charged. The same rule was laid down in the
</p>
<p>case of the King against Williams (in Hawkins) where the de-
</p>
<p>fendant was charged with composing and printing, publish-
</p>
<p>ing, and where there was no proof of printing, and the learned
</p>
<p>Judge laid it down, that the defendant might be found guilty of
</p>
<p>composing and publishing which was the sabstantive crome,

</p>
<p>and again the defendant may be found guilty as far as the resi-
</p>
<p>due goes; which may be proved. The overt acts charged, are
</p>
<p>preparing and distributing hand-bills and purchasing tickets, and
</p>
<p>again for throwing divers missiles, arrd it would be for their
</p>
<p>Lordships to say, whether any or all of tLe counts were sustain-
</p>
<p>ed, and in his opinion there were certain public acts of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, which afforded positive proof of the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>which must be considered as sufficiently substantiated, for the
</p>
<p>Learned Judges would tell them it was necessary to prove the
</p>
<p>parties having engaged in the conspiracy, and that the acts ol'ti.e
</p>
<p>parties were quite sufficient, and the Jury would be bound to
</p>
<p>convict: but in the present ca,~e they had proved more than the
</p>
<p>acts of the parties. To be sure the two witnesses who proved
</p>
<p>the conspiracy have been abusea in the strongest terms that were
</p>
<p>S2
</p>
<p>ever applied in a Court of Justice, because the witnesses them-
</p>
<p>selves had been engaged in the conspiracy; but, Gentlemen
</p>
<p>should reflect that? no secret act ot conspiracy, owing to the na-
</p>
<p>ture of the crime, could ever be brought to light if witnesses so
</p>
<p>situated were not admitted as witnesses ; but the moral guilt of
</p>
<p>the witnesses having engaged in a conspiracy, was considerably
</p>
<p>extenuated by their not having known or considered at the time
</p>
<p>there was any criminality in the proceeding ; but I am told that
</p>
<p>so soon as he reflected on, or was informed of the dangerous ten-
</p>
<p>dency of the conspiracy, the witness proceeded to the Park to
</p>
<p>acquaint his Excellency, and make the only reparation for his
</p>
<p>temporary breach of duty, and for so doing his evidence was not
</p>
<p>to be believed in a Court of Justice, and why ? because he saw
</p>
<p>the sentinel, who having prevented his admission, he in an un-
</p>
<p>settled and agitated state of mind returned to town without ef-
</p>
<p>fecting his purpose, all which was most natural and true, for he
</p>
<p>saw nothing certain, but was in that doubtful, unbalancing state
</p>
<p>men sometimes are, and in which any thing or nothing will cre-
</p>
<p>ate a change in their minds when they meet Avith any obstructi-
</p>
<p>on ; and he argued to himself that this apprehended crime might
</p>
<p>not lead to the results he at first apprehended. The great and
</p>
<p>important subject of obstructing Government in their measures,
</p>
<p>and to drive his Excellency from the country by issuing from
</p>
<p>their Lodge, in Werburgh-street, manifestoes prohibiting (the
</p>
<p>King from sending over whom he pleases to govern us, was
</p>
<p>clearly and satisfactorily proved by the evidence of the intention
</p>
<p>of the conspirators, and confirmed by their subsequent acts.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy hatched at the Shakespeare Tavern, and brought
</p>
<p>to maturity at D Jy's in Werburgh-street, and acted upon in the
</p>
<p>Theatre  and what measures do they take for carrying into ex-
</p>
<p>ecution their sed'tlous designs? they collect at a public house,
</p>
<p>work upon the turbulent minds of the lowest orders of men, they
</p>
<p>provide them with sticks or bludgeons, but before they dispatch
</p>
<p>them on their mission of wickedness, they are careful to ply

</p>
<p>them amply with ardent spirits, in order to excite their turbu-
</p>
<p>lent minds to the necessary degree of ferocity and desperation.
</p>
<p>This you have distinctly proved to you on the oath of one wit-
</p>
<p>Bess, and this was the force, in conjunction with the more re-
</p>
<p>spectable conspirators distributed through the house, with which
</p>
<p>his Excellency was to be compelled to quit the Theatre. Let it
</p>
<p>not be said that the Lord Mayor was the object  they could not
</p>
<p>drive him before the expiration of his year from his office. No %
</p>
<p>it was only the Marquis Wellesley was to be the victim of their
</p>
<p>sanguinary machinations ; but they say  oh, it was only inten-
</p>
<p>ded to drive him from the Theatre by groaning and hissing, and
</p>
<p>not assaulting him. Was it necessary to bring sticks to groan
</p>
<p>him * no, Gentlemen, you cannot be so foolish as to imagine
</p>
<p>they expected to atchieve their object by simply hissing him. To
</p>
<p>be sure I've heard that throwing a bottle at his Excellency was
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>nothing, if it was thrown at all, as indeed they gravely pretend-
</p>
<p>ed to doubt, and they have had witnesses to prove that the bot-
</p>
<p>tle was not thrown from the gallery. From the direction it
</p>
<p>came in, it' could not have issued from the gallery ; oh, but some
</p>
<p>young man in the pit, after drinking the contents, threw the bot-
</p>
<p>tle on the stage. This thought came in good time when they
</p>
<p>could no longer bear up against the ridicule of it coming from
</p>
<p>the carpenter's gallery : but can you, Gentlemen, for a moment
</p>
<p>doubt them having been thrown from the upper gallery after the
</p>
<p>evidence of Mr. O'Flaherty, Mr. Farrell, the young Medical
</p>
<p>Student, Dr. M'Namara, and Mr. Rooney ; some of these wit-
</p>
<p>nesses have also proved to you, that they saw it strike the cur-
</p>
<p>tain ; now do they meet this ? why do they not bring a witness
</p>
<p>who saw the bottle come from some other quarter of the house ?
</p>
<p>and see w T hat followed when they got into the Theatre, and it
</p>
<p>will account for when the bottle was thrown from the left hand
</p>
<p>side. On their arrival in a body of about seventy persons, they
</p>
<p>rushed tumultuously to the right hand, but it was already occu-
</p>
<p>pied, and to throw the bottle from where they were not surroun-
</p>
<p>ded by friends would have been a dangerous experiment. But
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the evidence in support of the bottle having been
</p>
<p>thrown is not confined to proving the hand that threw it ; it *s
</p>
<p>quite sufficient for the purpose of this prosecution, to prove that
</p>
<p>it came from some of the party ; but what is the evidence of
</p>
<p>Farrell, a respectable man, who kept his eye fixed upon Hand-
</p>
<p>wich the whole night ? can you doubt his testimony  can
</p>
<p>you suppose that such a man came for w aid to perjure himself in
</p>
<p>a case where he could have no earthly motive for so doing ? he
</p>
<p>is a man in a respectable situation in life, has lived for some
</p>
<p>years in this city, and though they knew from the commence-
</p>
<p>ment that he intended to come forward as a witness, yet notwith*
</p>
<p>standing all their exertions, they are unable to throw any discre-
</p>
<p>dit on his evidence, other than his having left Ireland at the age
</p>
<p>of two years old, and living from that time in London until the

</p>
<p>last four years: then you have the evidence of Dr. M'Namara,
</p>
<p>against whose testimony a Magistrate was to prove that in a
</p>
<p>Court of Justice he was not to be believed, because he was a
</p>
<p>a litigious man, and had been fined 201". and sentenced to three
</p>
<p>months imprisonment, for letting his own tenants cattle out of a
</p>
<p>pound, where he had put them himself; and yet the Magistrate
</p>
<p>acknowledged he had frequently acted on the Doctor's sworn
</p>
<p>informations. The Jury, he trusted, would not rashly discre-
</p>
<p>dit a man in any situation of life for minute variations, when
</p>
<p>the main points were corroborated. Farrell was unknown to
</p>
<p>Dr. M'Namara, and yet the Doctor corroborates him in all the
</p>
<p>essential particulars. Still they, Gentlemen, on the other side ar-
</p>
<p>gued it was impossible Handwich could throw the bottle with-
</p>
<p>out hitting some one behind him. Have you forgot the evidence
</p>
<p>of one witness, that Handwich, and was moving about, and of
</p>
<p>M
</p>
<p>another that h& was standing over him with a stick. Indepen-
</p>
<p>dent of this direct testimony, is it not evident that a space must
</p>
<p>have bee.i left from the rioters moving backward and forward.
</p>
<p>Then these was the evidence of that notable witness,, Brocas,
</p>
<p>who was produced for the defence. Brocas is at Gne time 27
</p>
<p>paces from Handwich, and suddenly he finds himself quite close
</p>
<p>to him., and yet he stated that himself .and Handwich were sta-
</p>
<p>tionary. Surely that is incompatible with the act he was des-
</p>
<p>cribing, and utterly impossible and incomprehensible. You
</p>
<p>know the evidence of Mr. Cahill, the Medical Student ; he does.
</p>
<p>not pretend to tell you who threw the bottle, but he tells you he
</p>
<p>saw it in its progress over the pit, as if coining from over his head
</p>
<p>in the upper gallery; you recollect the attempt made to entrap
</p>
<p>him about the brown liquor or porter, and how soon the Jury
</p>
<p>caught at it, thinking no doubt it was of wonderful import-
</p>
<p>ance, until it was clearly and easily explained. Well there
</p>
<p>was no impeachment of his evidence ; you saw him on the
</p>
<p>table, and witnessed his demeanour and manner of giving his
</p>
<p>evidence ; and yet if Brocas swears truly, this3^oung gentleman,
</p>
<p>,who belongs to no party, must jbave swore falsely, for Brocas
</p>
<p>swore that he believed no bottle was thrown at all from the
</p>
<p>galleL-y, so that he not only exculpated Handwich, on whom
</p>
<p>he says he kept his eye the whole night, but also those whom
</p>
<p>it was naturally impossible he could see unless similarly gifted
</p>
<p>with Argus, and which perhaps he fancies is the ease, for he
</p>
<p>was trying to get a peep now and then at Liston, then looking
</p>
<p>incessantly at Handwich, and again on the Lord Lieutenant,
</p>
<p>but that was of secondary importance to viewing Handwich,
</p>
<p>who, by the bye was very inconveniently placed for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose, being en a line with Brocas, and a crowd between them ;
</p>
<p>these are inconsistencies, Gentlemen, not easily reconcileable,
</p>
<p>yet I do not, after the example of my learned friends, brand
</p>
<p>Mr. Brocas as a perjurer ; what he swears he may beiieve,
</p>
<p>they maybe the workings of his fanciful brain, for he must be
</p>
<p>either a painter or a poet but I would not call any man a

<p>scoundrel, a rascal, or a villais, as has been done on the other
</p>
<p>side, and where they would not complain of any contradic-
</p>
<p>tion or inconsistency, but that the parties were witnesses ; for
</p>
<p>the cause of justice ; the learned Gentleman conceived, entitled
</p>
<p>him to stamp them with infamy all their lives; yet, he (Mr.
</p>
<p>Brocas) has made a mistake in his testimony. I will not im-
</p>
<p>pute to him the horrible crime of perjury, for he appears to
</p>
<p>be a wild and vapouring kind of man, whose mind may not
</p>
<p>be exactly framed according to the regulations by which other
</p>
<p>men s minds are distinguished. This poetical painter came
</p>
<p>to see the Lord Lieutenant, yet he could see no one but
</p>
<p>Handwich, who appeared to him to be a much more agreeable
</p>
<p>object. (Great laughter.) After the evidence of Mr. O'Fla-
</p>
<p>herty, Mr. Cahill, a Medical Student, Mr. Farrell and Doctor
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>M'Namara, and the other witness who have sworn to seeing
</p>
<p>the bottle in its progress, and from the left hand corner of
</p>
<p>the upper gallery, can you have any doubt of the bottle being
</p>
<p>thrown by some of the party in that corner, and if you believe
</p>
<p>it was thrown, who can doubt the object, when the intention
</p>
<p>has been declared of driving the Lord Lieutenant from the
</p>
<p>Theatre, and finally from the country ? Do you think the
</p>
<p>bottle was intended to drive off the actors why there were
</p>
<p>none on the stage at the time  was it intended for any one
</p>
<p>in the pit? The wicked and demoniac, they have proved them-
</p>
<p>selves one, can hardly think they would throw it promiscu-
</p>
<p>ously among their own friends and partisans, who, it has been
</p>
<p>proved to you, were in the pit; and if a doubt exists as to the
</p>
<p>destination of the bottle, why the destination of the rattle
</p>
<p>puts an end to these doubts. Do you not believe, or can you
</p>
<p>have a doubt, that one missile was intended for the same object
</p>
<p>as the other, which it has been proved struck the box where
</p>
<p>his Excellency sat, and cut the cushion ; and if it had struck
</p>
<p>him in the temple, can you hesitate to say it would have
</p>
<p>taken away his valuable life ? and at what time was it thrown ?
</p>
<p>(and here is a good and satisfactory argument that must con-
</p>
<p>vince the most incredulous) not when his Excellency was
</p>
<p>unassailable ; but at the time he presented himself to the au-
</p>
<p>dience for the purpose of joining in the universal cheer for
</p>
<p>the spontaneous manifestations of gratitude for his Majesty,
</p>
<p>then, and not till then, did they assail his Excellency.
</p>
<p>You have heard rheir loyalty blazoned forth in all the pomp
</p>
<p>of rhetoric, and commented on with great apparent faith in its
</p>
<p>profession. But how can you reconcile this action to loyalty,
</p>
<p>unless indeed it be loyalty to ferocious principles and diabo-
</p>
<p>lical passions ? Why was it that they availed themselves of
</p>
<p>this time? because they had no other opportunity and the

<p>missile came within a very few inches of his p( rson : buf they

<p>not conclusive, and you cannot believe it. Gentlt men do you
</p>
<p>recollect the conversation at Flanagan's, where regrut was ex-
</p>
<p>pressed that the bottle had not taken effect  that it was a bloo-
</p>
<p>dy rniss and that the next time they would be better prepared.
</p>
<p>This conversation! you had from two most respectable witnesses,
</p>
<p>one an Attorney, and the other an eminent merchant ; neither
</p>
<p>having any other object in view but the accomplishment oi jus-
</p>
<p>tice. Have they dared to cast any imputation upon their tes-
</p>
<p>timony or slur upon their credit? no, they stand unimpeach-
</p>
<p>e'd, and unimpeach&ble.
</p>
<p>At this part of the Learned Solicitors argument it was near
</p>
<p>five o'clock (the hour of adjournmtnt) and the Chief Justice
</p>
<p>suggested to him that was a favorable moment for adjourning,
</p>
<p>before he entered upon any new topic. The Court according-
</p>
<p>ly adjourned till. the next day.
</p>
<p>FIFTH DAY Friday, Feb. 7.
</p>
<p>About ten o'clock the Solicitor General resumed He
</p>
<p>begged to call their attention to a case greatly relied on by the
</p>
<p>other side, but which had not been correctly quoted, and you
</p>
<p>will see how different is the construction of the Learned Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen to that of truth, or of his Learred Friend, the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney General. It is from the Common s Journals, and was
</p>
<p>mentioned by the Attorney-General, in his opening statement,
</p>
<p>as a case where a Grand Jury had in ignorance endorsed a Bill
</p>
<p> found, instead of ignoramus ; the Jury having subsequently
</p>
<p>discovered their error, came into Court and made an affidavit
</p>
<p>of the fact. The parties against whom the bills were found
</p>
<p>resisted the quashing of the Bills, and prayed to be brought to
</p>
<p>trial. The Bills were quashed, and the Attorney-General filed
</p>
<p>Iiis informations ex-officio, and the Chancellor of Ireland, Sir
</p>
<p>Constantine Phibbs, held some communication with the She-
</p>
<p>riff, as to the mode of proceeding with the Jury. For this in-
</p>
<p>terference he was brought before the House, but there was no
</p>
<p>question of the Attorney-General's right to file the information.
</p>
<p>The parties pleaded not guilty to the informations, and the
</p>
<p>trial was fixed for Thursday, and on the day previous the
</p>
<p>parties moved to have the informations quashed ; and on this
</p>
<p>occasion two persons were examined, who, no doubt, might
</p>
<p>have been very respectable in their stations, but certainly
</p>
<p>were neither men of great legal authority or eminence, as was
</p>
<p>stated by my Learned Friend, Mr. Johnston, for one was
</p>
<p>merely the first Clerk of the Crown Office, and the other of
</p>
<p>the King's Bench, the first named Tisdal, and the other Cal-
</p>
<p>well. They were asked if they had ever known of an ex-
</p>
<p>ijjicio filed after a Bill had been thrown out by the.Grand Jury,
</p>
<p>:nd they answered they had no knowledge or such an occur-
</p>
<p>rence. Why thai does not prove the measure to be uncon-
</p>
<p>stitutional, but the reverse, because the Grand Jury having
</p>
<p>interrupted the course of Justice, it became imperative upon
</p>
<p>the Attorne} 7 -General to proceed in the only course left to

<p>him. And^this is the|high authority adverted to by the Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen on the other side, simply that they had never heard of
</p>
<p>such a prcceeding. With all cue respect to the Grand Jury,
</p>
<p>he would say the Petit Jury on the Constitutional tribunal,
</p>
<p>there is no doubt but the Attorney General might have
</p>
<p>fited his informations in the first instance ; but here the
</p>
<p>t omplaint is, that he first attempted to go before the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury ; but no man of any legal knowledge, no Lawyer
</p>
<p>\\h% has considered the question, can entertain a doubt of the
</p>
<p>legality of the proceeding, and so the Court would inform the
</p>
<p>Jury. On the last day they had discussed the evidence of the
</p>
<p>bottle haviug been thrown from the gallery, and that they
</p>
<p>rievtr attempted to shew that it had been thrown from any
</p>
<p>8/
</p>
<p>ether part of the house. Gyles O'Brien proved he saw some-
</p>
<p>thing which be could discern, as if throwing from the gallery.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Flaherty saw the bottle, and Mr. Farrell actually saw
</p>
<p>the man throw the bottle, and Doctor M'Namara a'so saw
</p>
<p>Handwich throw the bottle ; but his testimony they discredit,
</p>
<p>because he deposed to having heard aery of ' boys, mind your
</p>
<p>fire. ' But surely a man's evidence is not to be impeached
</p>
<p>because he may have heard what another did not. Try by that
</p>
<p>test the witness on the other side, observe what fell from that
</p>
<p>incessant observer, Mr Brocas  why he swore that he heard
</p>
<p>the expression of " down with the Ribuonmen ;" and yet that
</p>
<p>expression was not heard by another person, among all the
</p>
<p>witnesses produced  yet he did not consider that should in-
</p>
<p>duce them to disbelieve him ; for in such a scene of turmoil
</p>
<p>and confusion as had been described, the expressions used could
</p>
<p>not be easily heard by all. Tiernan proved that the bottle
</p>
<p>came from behind him and that it passed on to the stage.
</p>
<p>And do you believe this and the other witness who proved the
</p>
<p>fact, came here deliberately to perjure themselves, and with-
</p>
<p>out an\ earthly motive whatsoever ? Gentlemen, the credit of
</p>
<p>a witness is not to be destroyed by mere vituperation. Couple
</p>
<p>this testimony with that of Brocas, who swore no one could
</p>
<p>have thrown the bottle unseen by him. Yet did he come for-
</p>
<p>ward when Alderman Darley was about to arrest Handwich
</p>
<p>for throwing the bottle, and say " Alderman, you are about
</p>
<p>to arrest an innocent man ; I saw that man the whole night,
</p>
<p>and he could not have thrown the bottle." Why did he not
</p>
<p>come forward then as he does now ? Oh ! he tells you, indeed,
</p>
<p>he never heard of the bottle till the next day ? Now is that
</p>
<p>probable  can it be credited  is there a man in the house that
</p>
<p>night who did not hear of the bottle having been thrown  are
</p>
<p>not these good grounds for impeaching the credit of a witness ?
</p>
<p>From Mr. Farley's evidence it appears, that the bottle was a
</p>
<p>subject of conversation at Flanagan's ; and did Forbes then

</p>
<p>declare that the bottle was not thrown ? why not deny, instead
</p>
<p>of vindicating the Orangemen from it ? This proves that the
</p>
<p>throwing of the bottle was not innocent. ( Here one of the
</p>
<p>Jury was observed by the Attorney General to laugh, and he
</p>
<p>suggested to the Solicitor General, that perhaps the Juryman
</p>
<p>did not understand him.
</p>
<p>Solicitor General  Have I made myself understood, Sir ?
</p>
<p>Juror  Oh, yes, Sir, perfectly.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General resumed  If they had not known
</p>
<p>that the bottle was thrown, would they have thought it neces-
</p>
<p>sary to vindicate the whole Protestants of Ireland. By the
</p>
<p>evidence of Mr. Troy and Mr. Farley, it is proved that some
</p>
<p>of the party exclaimed it was a " damn'd miss," a " bloody miss,
</p>
<p>but we will be better prepared another time." This evidence
</p>
<p>S8
</p>
<p>establishes clearly, that throwing the bottle was not so harm-
</p>
<p>less or innocent an exploit as they would have you imagine ; on
</p>
<p>the contrary, the dissatisfaction at its failure was expressed in
</p>
<p>terms strong and not to be mistaken ; compare this testimony
</p>
<p>with that of Brocas, who swore the bottle was not thrown at
</p>
<p>all. Now if it was merely for amusement the bottle was
</p>
<p>thrown, as others will have it, why could not an Orangeman
</p>
<p>amuse himself as well as any other man. (Laughter.) If they
</p>
<p>, were of opinion the bottle was not thrown, would they have
</p>
<p>thought it necessary to vindicate themselves from the act. An-
</p>
<p>other defence set up is, that Forbes was raging mad drunk at
</p>
<p>the time  did he not say he was ready to sacrifice his life for
</p>
<p>the support of Orangeism, and is there any thing incompatible
</p>
<p>with his having used the expressions of regret, and that at an-
</p>
<p>other time they would be better prepared ; prepared for what,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen ? for that on which he was contemplating, " the
</p>
<p>damned miss" that had taken place. If the missile had struck the
</p>
<p>Lord Lieutenant and taken awa)' his life, and that such an ex -
</p>
<p>pression had been made in a moment of deliberation, is there a
</p>
<p>man on eaath who could have hesitated to indict Forbes capital-
</p>
<p>ly; we are told that this language was used when in a state of ex-
</p>
<p>asperation and warmth, and which in his sober moments he
</p>
<p>would have abhorred. But, Gentlemen, if in these moments of
</p>
<p>impetuosity, if he should knock a man's brains out, why the
</p>
<p>next morning he will tell you he is very sorry for it, and that
</p>
<p>be was warm. Gentlemen, the man who cannot restrain his
</p>
<p>tongue, cannot restrain his hands ; the man who induces a num-
</p>
<p>ber of infuriated ruffians to go to the Theatre, armed with blud-
</p>
<p>geons, and maddened with liquor  persons over whom he
</p>
<p>would have no controul and who, if they committed murder,
</p>
<p>he would have been a fellow murderer ; a man who, instead of
</p>
<p>expressing his regret at the bottle having been thrown, re-
</p>
<p>proaches himself with nothing but the failure of an attempt at
</p>
<p>assassination, is it at all improbable would have uttered the ex-

<p>clamation of being better prepared : and these see the dan-
</p>
<p>gerous coniequences that might ensue from such an exclamation
</p>
<p>in a society where lawless passion appeared to be the sole regu-
</p>
<p>lator of their proceedings  others would be found who, anxious
</p>
<p>to outstrip Forbes's zeal, would net hesitate to effect what For-
</p>
<p>bes only spoke of. But it has been attempted to be proved that
</p>
<p>such an expression was not used. The witnesses, Troy and
</p>
<p>Farley, have not stated that Forbes said it, but that it came
</p>
<p>from the party at which he was present, and here you see the
</p>
<p>aftoress and ability of Gentlemen on the other side. Pounden
</p>
<p>and Smith are introduced, and Pounden is asked, did you
</p>
<p>hear him say Devil mend him ; no, was the reply. Did the
</p>
<p>lurried and ingenious Council ask him, did yeu hear the words 3
</p>
<p>tfi-ime;! miss, or we'll be better prepared another time.
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>Mr. Perrin rose and said, he had an impression upon hie
</p>
<p>mind that the question was put.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor General appealed to the Judges, who all look-
</p>
<p>ed at their books, and declared an answer to such a question
</p>
<p>did not appear on their notes.
</p>
<p>One of the Jury thought the question was asked.
</p>
<p>Another of the Jury raid it was not.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor Genera J then resumed Then I am right.
</p>
<p>My Learned Friend, Mr. Perrin, has not departed from his
</p>
<p>usual ingenuity of going round and round the question, and
</p>
<p>never putting it. They asked a question of quite a different na-
</p>
<p>ture  did Mr. Forbes say we'll take better aim another time-
</p>
<p>no, the expression sworn to by the two witnesses was, we'll be
</p>
<p>better prepared anpther time. But, Gentlemen, all this wr.s
</p>
<p>quite in unison with the lawless proceedings of sanguinary ruf-
</p>
<p>iians, who prostitute the appellation of a loyal man, by making
</p>
<p>it a sanction for the worst of purposes. Now compare the tes-
</p>
<p>timony of Smith and Pounden with that of those notable eve's-
</p>
<p>droppers, as Council call them. Look at Mr. Troy and Mr,
</p>
<p>Farley, one confirming the other. These Gentlemen allow that
</p>
<p>Mr. Pounden and Mr. Smith were in the room together, atfd
</p>
<p>yet no such question was put to them, as, did they heer "we'll
</p>
<p>be better prepared another time." Pounden says Forces and par-
</p>
<p>ty left the box, and went to sup in another part of the room.
</p>
<p>Smith says they did not quit the box the whole night. Poun-
</p>
<p>den says the toasts were given after supper. Smith says they
</p>
<p>were given immediately on their entering the room. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>you saw Smith swearing what was in contradiction to Pounden
</p>
<p>on one side, and Troy and Farley on the other, and like the
</p>
<p>young medical student, you took him up, but how different
</p>
<p>was the effect. One dissipated a seeming contradiction, while
</p>
<p>the other got entangled more and more in the mazes of false-
</p>
<p>hood. You asked him if he saw the cloth laid and removed for
</p>
<p>supper, and whether he was certain they remained in the same

</p>
<p>box the whole night, to all of which he answered in the affir-
</p>
<p>mative. Such are the witnesses opposed to the eve's dropper's,
</p>
<p>as Mr. North calls them  eve's-dropper's because two respecta-
</p>
<p>ble Gentlemen heard a conversation which the Government
</p>
<p>were apprised of their having heard. They were unconnected
</p>
<p>with any party, and the Government called upon them to come
</p>
<p>forward and support the laws and the Constitution. You saw
</p>
<p>at the moment Smith stepped off the table the confusion in the
</p>
<p>enemy's ranks. As one brother stepped off, the other brother
</p>
<p>stepped out, and very wisely, for the brother's inaccuracies
</p>
<p>were certainly not calculated to obtain impartial belief to tie
</p>
<p>same story from Mr. Smith. Smith said I' spend my evenint &
</p>
<p>at Daly's, but I never for six months went into the Ledge held
</p>
<p>in that house. I knew nothing of the ph v, and to my asto-
</p>
<p>nishment found a number of my brethren in the pit. Oh, said
</p>
<p>be, I saw some bits of paper  something about "Morning/e,
</p>
<p>mind, not Morning tone, and did not know that it might not
</p>
<p>have been applied to the Lord Mayor. The learned Solicitor
</p>
<p>here hoped he was stating the evidence fairly, if not he was in
</p>
<p>the correction of the Court and Jury. Brocas swore that Hand-
</p>
<p>wich was the most troublesome man he had seen the whole
</p>
<p>night ; he added, that he had seen some man drinking out of a
</p>
<p>bottle at the other side, but does not attempt to shew what be-
</p>
<p>came of it. They produced the promptnr to prove, in his
</p>
<p>plumb line, that it was impossible for a person sitting by the
</p>
<p>front of the middle gallery, to see a man stand up between the
</p>
<p>second and third rows of the upper-gallery ; but theyjsaw the
</p>
<p>plumb could not serve their purpose, and the prompter is dis-
</p>
<p>patched after Smith. With respect to Graham, the evidence
</p>
<p>was so strong of his having flung the rattle, and confirmed
</p>
<p>by so many respectable witnesses, that he conceived it would
</p>
<p>be an unwarrantable consumption of the public time were
</p>
<p>he to recapitulate the evidence adduced against him; and
</p>
<p>with respect to an assault, hold it in your recollection, it is
</p>
<p>not reasoning, that a thing flung, must strike its destined object,
</p>
<p>to constitute an assault ; and it is perfectly clear and plain,
</p>
<p>that? here was an original design to commit the assault. It has
</p>
<p>been argued, that it is a legitimate right possessed by every
</p>
<p>one to go to the Theatre, make a noise and disturbance  such
</p>
<p>a proposition was not tenable, for no one could conspire to go
</p>
<p>to a Theatre to annoy any man, or turn him into ridicule  such
</p>
<p>a conspiracy was often more injurious and deeply wounding
</p>
<p>to the feelings than bodily injury. The Learned Counsel
</p>
<p>have quoted to you the trial of the O. P's.  the verdict has
</p>
<p>been stated to you, but not the law, which is, as I have stated
</p>
<p>it  but the law of the case you will take from the Bench 
</p>
<p>Auditors may approve of or hiss an actor, if they like or dis-
</p>
<p>like him, according to their opinion of his merits or demerits ;
</p>
<p>but if they go there with a premeditated intent to hiss that ac-
</p>
<p>tor, it is a conspiracy ; if they go there with a settled design to

</p>
<p>damn that actor, there is no doubt but it is a conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>punishable by law. Aye, but I am told Mr. Forbes is a loyal
</p>
<p>man, and therefore it is to be supposed, that if he breaks his
</p>
<p>neighbour's head, the-law is to protect him. Kut let us see
</p>
<p>what is their loyalty. It consists in insulting his Majesty's
</p>
<p>Representative, flying in his Sovereign's face, and that of Lis
</p>
<p>injunctions  that is their loyalty, forsooth. If that be their
</p>
<p>loyalty, he could wish they had less of it. It has been argued
</p>
<p>that an Orangeman will swear he Will keep the peace, as if
</p>
<p>that were to be a justification of his breaking it, hi addition
</p>
<p>to the natural obedience every subject owes the King ; an
</p>
<p>Orangeman, it is said, takes an oath to observe them ; and
</p>
<p>will you not visit with exemplary punishment the man who
</p>
<p>violates all those obligations of supporting the peace, the
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>King, the laws, nnd the Constitution ; ar.d how has the illus*
</p>
<p>trious and insulted individual incurred the displeasure of these
</p>
<p>infatuated, turbulent, violent men ?  by undressing the statue
</p>
<p>of King William, in obedience to the commands of his Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, awl the concurrence of the entire Cabinet, of Lord Li-
</p>
<p>verpool, Lord Eldon, and Mr. Peel. And is it for the Club
</p>
<p>at Werburgh street to set at defiance the resolves of his Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty and Government ? With some of the principles professed
</p>
<p>by these persons I am known to concur, not in outrage, but in
</p>
<p>the valuable part of them. If they wish the Catholics should
</p>
<p>be content with what they enjoy, why let them do so in peace.,
</p>
<p>and be it your care to make them satisfied.
</p>
<p>He would not attempt to draw the character of the Head of
</p>
<p>the Irish Government, he would leave that to more able hands ;
</p>
<p>but it was impossible at present not to remark upon the faithful
</p>
<p>and upright manner in which that exalted individual had
</p>
<p>srtictly, fairly, and honourably discharged the important duties
</p>
<p>of his high office, since the first moment of his arrival in this
</p>
<p>Kingdom. When he arrived he found this country in a state
</p>
<p>the most embarrassing to a Chief Governor ; an Insurrection,
</p>
<p>amounting to an pen rebellion, in the South  that pestilence
</p>
<p>followed by wretchedness and starvation, yet, although of ne*
</p>
<p>nessity, deprived of the assistance of the Attorney General,
</p>
<p>and able Secretary of State, he laboured to a degree that the
</p>
<p>commonest clerk would have considered drudgery. He knew
</p>
<p>his (the Solicitor General's) sentiments upon a certain ques-
</p>
<p>tion, before he did him the honor t*> appoint him, and yet he
</p>
<p>never had alluded to his opinions in any manner whatever dur-
</p>
<p>ing his frequent conferences, in the absence or the Attorney
</p>
<p>General ; and if any man says that it is Lord Wellesley's wist!
</p>
<p>to deprive persons of their political or constitutional privileges,
</p>
<p>he says what is unfounded. He was bound in honor, he was
</p>
<p>bound in justice, to say, for his frequ fit interviews with his
</p>
<p>Excellency had i. Warded him frequent opportunities of marking

</p>
<p>the never-ceasing anxiety, the constant alacrity, and the in-
</p>
<p>Aincible impartiality, with which he discharged his high and
</p>
<p>important trust. On his most solemn word he never yet
</p>
<p>saw a more strictly impartial individual in his life, his sole object
</p>
<p>was not to put down any party, but to deai justice to all. 
</p>
<p>With respect to the hand-bills or placard., he said theJury had
</p>
<p>it proved to them that they w^re showered down from the lat-
</p>
<p>tices, and that William Graham had brought them into the
</p>
<p>pit in a bundle ; and can any man doubt that it was by previous
</p>
<p>concert to effect a certain purpose % The Learned Lord would
</p>
<p>supply any defect from his statement of the law and the evi-
</p>
<p>dence, and did not care what were their feelings out of Court ;
</p>
<p>they had taken a solumn oath, and as they hoped for mercy
</p>
<p>hereafter, he called upon them to entitle themselves to it by the
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>honest performance of their duty ; he did not mean to impul*
</p>
<p>any doubt of them, but instances have unfortunately occurred
</p>
<p>before now of the violation of a solemn obligation. You have
</p>
<p>entered info an agreement with your God, violate it if you
</p>
<p>dare. I call upon you to weigh deliberately the evidence in
</p>
<p>this case, and, as you hope for mercy hereafter, find your
</p>
<p>verdict.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice commenced his charge as follows :
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury  It is in general the duty of the
</p>
<p>Court to call the attention of the Jury to the nature of the
</p>
<p>evidence which has been laid before them. In some of the
</p>
<p>statements which have been made to you, aeveral topics have
</p>
<p>been introduced, which are not connected with the case imme-
</p>
<p>diately before you. First, as to the question of the legality
</p>
<p>or illegality of the Ex-officio Information not yet being decided ;
</p>
<p>with this you have nothing to do, and on the plea of Not Guilty
</p>
<p>being put in, you are bound to presume that proceeding legal.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next topic 1 wish you to exclude from your
</p>
<p>observation is, the act of the Grand Jury in ignoring the Bills ;
</p>
<p>that act of the Grand Jury is not in evidence before you. If
</p>
<p>3t must be conceded as a fact, that the Grand Jury did ignore
</p>
<p>those Bills, it ought to induce you to proceed with the greater
</p>
<p>caution ; but, to say that their decision should govern yours,
</p>
<p>would be monstrous. They have decided on their oaths. You
</p>
<p>Will decide on yours. It is not by their judgment or their
</p>
<p>consciences that you are to be influenced, but by your own.
</p>
<p>It would, lead to conclusions of a very alarming nature, when
</p>
<p>we consider the importance attached to this trial, if feelings
</p>
<p>of a political tendency were allowed to influence your delibe-
</p>
<p>rations. The political interests of the country are, in some
</p>
<p>measure, involved in this case, and it therefore imperiously
</p>
<p>calls for a calm and dispassionate consideration. You will
</p>
<p>not, I trust, Gentlemen, give a political or factious verdict,
</p>
<p>if political feelings are allowed to enter into that Jury Box,

</p>
<p>the consequences must be deplorable. If they are permitted
</p>
<p>to interfere with the course of justice, it puts an end to the
</p>
<p>Constitution. Every subject of the realm who enters this
</p>
<p>Court, leaves his political feelings at its threshold. You, a*
</p>
<p>Jurors, are sworn to do justice in this particular case. Who
</p>
<p>could forget, in this Christian country, that when man thus
</p>
<p>takes on himself to award justice to his fellow man, he sanc-
</p>
<p>tions the obligation by a solemn appeal to his God ? Are
</p>
<p>you sworn to adjust the affairs of this country ? Are you
</p>
<p>called on to decide the question of the Protestant Ascendancy ?
</p>
<p>Are you impannelled to consider the legality of an Orange
</p>
<p>Association ? Are you called on to declare whether concilia-
</p>
<p>tion or discord shall prevail in this country ? No, Gentlemen I
</p>
<p>you are sworn to try the particular case before you, and 19
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>decide according to the evidence that hat been produced.
</p>
<p>Your first duty, Gentlemen, will be to consider if any, and
</p>
<p>which of tiie traversers are guilty of the Conspiracy with
</p>
<p>which they stand charged, and next, if any, and which are
</p>
<p>guilty of the riot. There are two informations against the
</p>
<p>traversers, the first, which is tor a conspiracy, contains three
</p>
<p>counts. The second, for a riot, contains two counts.
</p>
<p>(Here the Chief Justice recapitulated the various counts in
</p>
<p>the indictment.)
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, these informations involve as serious a charge
</p>
<p>as can come under the denomination of a misdemeanor. It
</p>
<p>may be necessary, Gentlemen, for the Court to define to you,
</p>
<p>the nature of the crime with which the prisoners stand charged.
</p>
<p>(Here the Chief Justice explained the legal construction of
</p>
<p>riot and conspiracy.)
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we are of opinion, for I am authorised by my
</p>
<p>brother Judges to say so, that if the evidence produced on the
</p>
<p>part of theCrown is true.of which you arethe best judges, that it
</p>
<p>is abundantly sufficient to support this information. It has been
</p>
<p>said, Gentlemen, that an audience has a right to hiss. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the rights of an audience are already defined. An
</p>
<p>audience may cry down a play, or hiss, or hoot an actor ; an
</p>
<p>audience may be noisy, but not riotous; besides, this must be
</p>
<p>the feeling of the moment, if not, it becomes criminal, and
</p>
<p>would have the effect of turning the Theatre into an arena for
</p>
<p>factious rioters. The Theatre is a place of cultivated amuse-
</p>
<p>ment, or as some say of moral improvement. I know of no
</p>
<p>distinction between the rights of an audience and those of the
</p>
<p>persons in this Court, except that respect which is paid to the
</p>
<p>law.
</p>
<p>I will read to you, Gentlemen, four questions for your con-
</p>
<p>sideration.
</p>
<p>First  Do'you believe that there was any riot in the Theatre
</p>
<p>on that night.

</p>
<p>Secondly  If you do believe there was a riot., do you believe
</p>
<p>any or the prisoners took a part in it, and which of them t
</p>
<p>Thirdly  Do you believe that the riot commenced on a sud-
</p>
<p>den, momentarily, or was it the result of a previous con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ?
</p>
<p>Fourthly  If you believe that it was the result of a previous
</p>
<p>conspiracy, were any of the prisoners, and which of them
</p>
<p>were parties to it ?
</p>
<p>Your duty is to judge from the evidence, if you believe any
</p>
<p>of those persons guilty, you will find him guilty, and if you
</p>
<p>believe, from the evidence adduced, any one of those persons
</p>
<p>innocent, you will acquit that person.
</p>
<p>I will now, said his Lordship, take the prisoners severally
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, first there is Mr. Forbes Mr. Lowther, the box-
</p>
<p>S4
</p>
<p>keeper, states that he bought six tickets from him for that
</p>
<p>j-jjgLit  tin's corroborates the statement of Atkinson- ' If any
</p>
<p>Gentleman of the T ury, thinks that I have mistated anything,
</p>
<p>I will take it as a favour if he vriii set me right  ( So ! no !
</p>
<p>from the Jury -box). Mr. Greaves deposed, that Forbes was
</p>
<p>in the upper lattices, near whefe the placards were thrown
</p>
<p>from at the time ; lie took him into custody with the whistle in
</p>
<p>his hand. Tiiis is a further corroboration of Atkinson's testi-
</p>
<p>mony. The next witness is Mr. George Farley, and if he
</p>
<p>has deposed trul} 7 , the tacts which he has deposed to, relative
</p>
<p>to the Tavern in Essex-street, are utterly inconsistent with the
</p>
<p>innocence of Forbes, as to the riot or conspiracy. Mr. James
</p>
<p>Troy's evidence goes to the same effect. Mr. Pounden, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, have been produced for the defence; they botli
</p>
<p>go, to a certain degree, to support Mr. Troj-, and the other
</p>
<p>respectable witness.
</p>
<p>The next Traverser I shall point your attention to is Henry
</p>
<p>Handwich. One witness, Christopher Moran, saw him rioting
</p>
<p>in the gallery that night ; another witness M. Farrell, saw him
</p>
<p>throw the bottle. But, Gentlemen, part of the defence set up is,
</p>
<p>that there was no battle thrown, and that if their was, it
</p>
<p>not thrown by. Henry tlandwich. Gentlemen, Brocas, was
</p>
<p>his own witness, who was bi ought forward to exculpate him,
</p>
<p>admits that he saw a stick or rattle thrown from the very same
</p>
<p>place from whence it was alledged to be impossible to throw a
</p>
<p>bottle. Dr. M'Namara has stated that he heard one of then*
</p>
<p>sy, " Mind your fire." Mr. Trench has sworn that Dr. M'Na-
</p>
<p>ma*a is not entitled to credit. His own witness, Brocas, if you
</p>
<p>believe him, has acquitted Henry Handwich of throwing the
</p>
<p>bottle, of which he is not accused in the information, but he
</p>
<p>convicts him of riot. Brocas gave more distinct and precise
</p>
<p>evidence of the riot than all the witnesses for the Crown. To
</p>
<p>separate the riot from the conspiracy, you must disbelieve the
</p>
<p>evidence as to the words " Look ov.fc, boys/' and the printed

</p>
<p>placards which had been circulated through the house. If I
</p>
<p>take up these informations I could take something from the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of this Brocas, in support of every count in each informa-
</p>
<p>tion, and if he had not been produced on the part of the pri-
</p>
<p>soners, I could almost have supposed, that it was from his tes-
</p>
<p>timony the Crown Solicitor had drawn up the informations.
</p>
<p>With respect to Matthew Handwich, the witnesses Eastham
</p>
<p>and Moran, have been produced in corroboration of Atkinson,
</p>
<p>in the case of Wm. Graham, Mr. Lowther, of the Theatre,
</p>
<p>swore, that he (Graham) purchased six tickets for that night;
</p>
<p>it is sworn to by a Mr. Lambert, that he distributed hand-bills
</p>
<p>ui the Theatre, which he brought in with him ; Mr. Farley
</p>
<p>and Mr. Troy swore to the facts which are utterly inconsistent
</p>
<p>with the innocence of either William Gi\;ham or Forbes.
</p>
<p>$5
</p>
<p>With respeet to George Graham, three witnesses, namely,
</p>
<p>Mr. Philip Ryan, James Tiernan, and Serjeant-Major Harris,
</p>
<p>have deposed to their seeing hiin throw the rattle.
</p>
<p>Exclusive of the Atkinson's, there are fifteen witnesses who
</p>
<p>* swore to the riot ; and also the witness Brocas. Among the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the defence was Lady Rossmore ; she stated that
</p>
<p>she was in the House on that night ; that she was not alarmed,
</p>
<p>but that her hearing was not good, and it does her Ladyship in-
</p>
<p>finite credit that she was not alarmed.  (Much laughter.)
</p>
<p>Here the Chief Justice recapitulated from his Notes, the evi-
</p>
<p>dence that had been produced, and concluded a most impressive
</p>
<p>and luminous charge, by leaving the question as to the credibi-
</p>
<p>lity of the witnesses, entirely for the consideration of the Jury.
</p>
<p>Judge J ebb then shortly addressed the Jury  he expressed
</p>
<p>his full concurrence in every thing that fell from the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton also expressed his perfect concurrence in.
</p>
<p>the sentiments of the Chief Justice, and was followed by
</p>
<p>Jxidge Vandeleur, who spoke to the same effect.
</p>
<p>At twenty-five minutes past three o'clock the Jury retired.
</p>
<p>A Bailiff was then called, and being sworn, they were givea
</p>
<p>in charge to him.
</p>
<p>A few minutes after five o'clock Judge Jebb called the She-
</p>
<p>riff, and desired him to inquire if the Jury were likely to agree.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff returned with word that " they were.''
</p>
<p>At six o'clock the Sheriff was again called by the Court, and
</p>
<p>sent to inquire if the Jury were likely to agree.
</p>
<p>The Sheriff returned with word that ' e they had nearly agreed.
</p>
<p>At the expiration of another half hour, Judge Jebb told the
</p>
<p>Sheriff to desire the Jury to come into Court.
</p>
<p>The Jury having Come into their box, and answered to their
</p>
<p>names, Judge Jebb told them that, in a case of such impor-
</p>
<p>tance, it was not the wish of the Court that they shoidd be hur-
</p>
<p>ried in their decision. The Court would therefore adjourn un-

</p>
<p>til nine o'clock, when the Judges would again take their seats
</p>
<p>on the Bench, and receive the verdict, if the Jury had by that
</p>
<p>hour agreed. If they should agree in the interim, messengers
</p>
<p>fihbu'ld be left in readiness, who would apprise the Judges, and
</p>
<p>they would return to Court then, and receive the verdict.
</p>
<p>Here one of the Jury mentioned, 'that he thought it likely
</p>
<p>they should agree in about fifteen minutes ; but the Court ex-
</p>
<p>pressed a wish that they should not be hurried in their delibe-
</p>
<p>rations.
</p>
<p>One of the Gentlemen of the Jury here mentioned, that A
</p>
<p>Juror was ill, and inquired if he would be allowed some water.
</p>
<p>The Court gave directions to have some watef brought to the
</p>
<p>Jury-room/ The Jury then retired again.
</p>
<p>A Bailiff was here called, and being sWorn, was required to
</p>
<p>keep all easement, fire and candle light excepted, from them.
</p>
<p>The Jury were then locked tap; and the Sheriff having beeo
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>told not to leave the Court, and to keep the gallery leading to
</p>
<p>the Jury-room clear of all persons, the Court adjourned to nine
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, Judges Burton and Vandeleur came into
</p>
<p>Court, and the Jury being ordered to attend, Judge Vandeleur
</p>
<p>inquired if they had agreed to their verdict?
</p>
<p>The Foreman said they had not agreed, and were not likely
</p>
<p>to agree.
</p>
<p>Judge Vandeleur then desired them to return to their room
</p>
<p>until nine o'clock next day, when the Court would again sit.
</p>
<p>The Jury then retired.
</p>
<p>The Court ordered the Sheriff to allow no communication
</p>
<p>whatever with the Jury, to lock the door of the Jury-room, and
</p>
<p>keep the key himself, and to place a Tipstaff of the Court upon
</p>
<p>the door all night.
</p>
<p>The Court adjourned to nine o'clock next morning.
</p>
<p>SIXTH DAY, Saturday, Feb. 8.
</p>
<p>At 20 minutes past ten o'clock, Mr. Justice Jebb, Mr. Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Burton, and Mr. Justice Vandeleur took their seats on the
</p>
<p>bench. The Attorney and Solicitor-General entered the
</p>
<p>Court shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Jebb  Mr. Sheriff ask the Jury if they have
</p>
<p>agreed.
</p>
<p>The High Sheriff went to the Jury Room and having re-
</p>
<p>turned said  No my Lord they have not, nor cannot agree.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  Mr. Attorney-General, you have heard the
</p>
<p>answer of the Jury.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General.  I have my Lord, perhaps your Lord-
</p>
<p>ship would think proper to enquire, if there be a difference on
</p>
<p>any points of law which your Lordship could explain  we of
</p>
<p>Counsel for the Crown, do not think it right to interfere, my
</p>
<p>Lord.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb.  Mr. Attorney- General, I think that the evi-
</p>
<p>dence has been so very fully and fairly explained by the Lord

</p>
<p>Chief Justice, and the points of law so distinctly and explicit-
</p>
<p>ly denned, that I fear the Court cannot give the Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury any further assistance  I shall ask them if they
</p>
<p>ha\e agreed as to any of the Traversers.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General.  In that case, my Lord, I have not any
</p>
<p>desire that the Jury should be called out  they have not yet
</p>
<p>agreed my Lord.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  Let the Jury be called out.
</p>
<p>The traversers were called, and appeared, they took their
</p>
<p>seats on the bench which had been appropriated tor their use
</p>
<p>during the trial, and which was erected on the left side of the
</p>
<p>C< urt from the Bench, and within the Lawyers' Bar.
</p>
<p>The Jury came into Court they answered to their names.
</p>
<p> 97
</p>
<p>Mr. Francis Mills, Foreman, resumed the seat he had oc-
</p>
<p>cupied during the trial, next to the Judges, the four next
</p>
<p>Jurors sat in the same row with him, viz. : 
</p>
<p>Mr. Francis Mills, Mr. James Wyon, Mr. Abraham Kar-
</p>
<p>grave, and Mr. Edward Armstrong.
</p>
<p>On the second row sat Mr. Neil M'Kenny, on the extreme
</p>
<p>right next him, Mr. Thomas Fry, Mr. John Baker, and Mf.
</p>
<p>Thomas Parker.
</p>
<p>Behind them were, Mr. John Caldwell, Mr. Richard Dol-
</p>
<p>lard, Mr, Richard Annesley, and Mr. Isaac Tyndall.
</p>
<p>All the Jurors took possession of the places they had oc-
</p>
<p>cupied during the five preceding days.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Jebb  Gentlemen, have you agreed ?
</p>
<p>The Foreman  We have not, my Lord.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  We we wish to know if there be any diffi-
</p>
<p>culty relative to a point of law which we could explain to you.
</p>
<p>A Juror at the back of the box replied in a loud voice,
</p>
<p>" we have no difficulty on any point of law whatever."
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  Gentlemen, have you agreed as to any of the
</p>
<p>traversers ?
</p>
<p>Foreman  We have, my Lord, as to William Brownlow.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  Gentlemen, (to the Jury,) you may retire*
</p>
<p>Attorney General  To the Chamber, my Lord.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  Oh, yes, certainly to the Chamber.
</p>
<p>The Jury retired.
</p>
<p>The Attorney and Solicitor Generals bowed and withdrew.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Jebb here inquired of Counsel for the Tra-
</p>
<p>versers, if they had any thing on their part to move.
</p>
<p>They severally replied they had not.
</p>
<p>Here the Ccurt ordered the stats of the outer bar to be
</p>
<p>cleared for the Lawyers. The traversers remained at the side
</p>
<p>Bar.
</p>
<p>The Attorney and Solicitor General returned, having been
</p>
<p>absent only a few minutes.

</p>
<p>Attorney General. My Lords, I wish to mention, that as
</p>
<p>the Jury have declared they cannot agree, I shall not on the
</p>
<p>part of the Crown stand in the way of any thing which your
</p>
<p>Lordships may think fit to adopt.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb  The Court have the power to discharge the
</p>
<p>Jury whn the period arrives appointed by law, but as the
</p>
<p>Counsel for the Traversers do not make any objection, we are
</p>
<p>at liberty to discharge the Jury now.
</p>
<p>The Attorney General.  The Traversers will understand
</p>
<p>that the trial not having been disposed of, and the effect being
</p>
<p>to leave the case yet open, they will be still held over on their
</p>
<p>bail, for most undoubtedly this case shall agah; be brought be-
</p>
<p>fore the public. As to the time for si new trial, my Lords,
</p>
<p>Ss
</p>
<p>I beg your Lordships will understand that I hare not intimated
</p>
<p>any period, it would be too late for this Terra.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb.  From the state of the Court, not this Term.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Certainly not, my Lord.
</p>
<p>The Jury were again called over, and asked by the Court if
</p>
<p>they had agreed ; they said that they had not ; but they re-
</p>
<p>turned a verdict of Not Guilty for William Brownlow, who
</p>
<p>was discharged.
</p>
<p>Justice Jebb.  Gentlemen of the Jury, the Counsel for the
</p>
<p>Crown, rinding that you are not likely to agree, have not of-
</p>
<p>fered any obstacles in the way of your discharge, you are ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly discharged.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, then addressieg the Court, said, " I
</p>
<p>do not mean to interfere with the Gentlemen of thejury, I
</p>
<p>only wish to intimate that nothing which has occurred, impe-
</p>
<p>des my taking further proceedings against the Traversers, in'
</p>
<p>case I should be advised so to do."
</p>
<p>The Traversers were then informed, that they would be still
</p>
<p>held on their recognizances; they were then allowed to with.*
</p>
<p>draw,
</p>
<p>Counsel for the Crown  The Attorney-General, the Solici-
</p>
<p>tor-General, Serjeant Lefroy, Serjeant Torrens, Mr. J.
</p>
<p>Sealy Townsend, and Mr. Green.  Agent, Mr. Kemmis,,

</p>
<p>Counsel for the Traversers  Messrs. Driscoll, R. Johnston,
</p>
<p>Blackburne, Rolleston, Hamilton, North, Scriven, Perrin,
</p>
<p>and Speare  Agent, Mr. George Fearon.
