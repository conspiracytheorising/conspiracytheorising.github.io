<p>EXPLANATORY INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>THE reader* will learn from the following pages that the fratricidal
</p>
<p>contest into which our country has been led is not a thing of chance,
</p>
<p>but of deliberate design, and that it has been gradually preparing for
</p>
<p>almost thirty years. The dark plotters of South Carolina and Virgi
</p>
<p>nia, who in 1832 and 1833 were defeated in their nullification and
</p>
<p>disunion schemes by the fidelity and decision of Jackson, though
</p>
<p>abashed and discomfited, did not relinquish their purpose, notwith
</p>
<p>standing they changed their plans. At first they resolved on organiz
</p>
<p>ing a direct resistance to the Federal authority throughout the South
</p>
<p>as soon as the &quot;Southern heart&quot; could be &quot;fired&quot; for that purpose;
</p>
<p>but, fearing a second reverse from the popularity of the Democratic
</p>
<p>party, they veered from a policy of open assault against that party and
</p>
<p>the Union, to one of sapping and mining both. Hence Mr. Calhoun
</p>
<p>and his secession allies, in 1837, joined the Democratic party, that from
</p>
<p>1833 to 1836 they had hated and denounced. By little and little the
</p>
<p>Secessionists, after having attained admission to its counsels, modified
</p>
<p>the policy of the party, continually changing it more and more in
</p>
<p>conformity with their own ideas. Thus it was in pursuit of aims, purely
</p>
<p>Southern and sectional, that the Mexican province of Texas was
</p>
<p>overrun and conquered by American adventurers in 1835 and 1836;
</p>
<p>that Texas was annexed in 1845 ; and that the war with Mexico was
</p>
<p>inaugurated. It was to subserve Southern, and eventually Disunion,
</p>
<p>purposes that the Missouri Compromise was repealed, and all the evil
</p>
<p>enginery of Lecomptonism put into operation. It was to further the
</p>
<p>accursed cause of national disruption that just such a Cabinet as that
</p>
<p>of Buchanan was gathered up, whereby the army might be dispersed,
</p>
<p>the navy scattered, and the national treasury plundered and bank-

</p>
<p>rupted so that Secession might march unmolested over the prostrate
</p>
<p>form of our noble Government. The one purpose of disunion has
</p>
<p>been for the greater part of the time the animating principle of State
</p>
<p>rights policy, since Calhoun and his adherents stealthily wormed
</p>
<p>themselves into the citadel of the Democracy. Even so apparently
</p>
<p>insignificant a matter as the repair and return of the English ship
</p>
<p>Resolute to the British Government, was undoubtedly due to the
</p>
<p>anxiety of the Southern Confederates to conciliate the good will
</p>
<p>of England, and secure for them her future alliance. The Secession-
</p>
<p>nists courted and used the Democratic party from 1837 to 1860, and
</p>
<p>in the latter year, at Charleston, having no further use for that organi
</p>
<p>zation, ruthlessly rent it asunder. Without dispute our country is
</p>
<p>suffering from the effects of a conspiracy unparalleled in its nature
</p>
<p>and extent in the history of mankind. In comparison with it the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of Catiline and Cethegus in ancient Rome fades into mean
</p>
<p>ness and insignificance. The American conspiracy is now and may
</p>
<p>ever continue its own only parallel.
</p>
<p>In addition to the testimony furnished by the past history and pre
</p>
<p>sent circumstances of the country, in proof of the above positions, there
</p>
<p>is happily a piece of irresistible evidence supplied us in the pages of a
</p>
<p>most remarkable work written and secretly printed in the years 1835
</p>
<p>and 183G, in which nearly every important point of the great conspi
</p>
<p>racy which is developing itself in our own immediate day, stands dis
</p>
<p>tinctly shadowed forth. Composed in the form of a novel, its twin
</p>
<p>object was to excite the South to rebellion, and to teach how to make
</p>
<p>that rebellion successful. It was &quot; a tale of the future,&quot; and most
</p>
<p>wonderfully is that &quot; future&quot; fulfilling its predictions. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>Jeff. Davises, Tanceys, Pryors, Rhetts, Letchers, etc., seem to have
</p>
<p>done little else than servilely to. follow out the programme sketched
</p>
<p>for them in this remarkable book. Its author, Professor BEVERLY
</p>
<p>TUCKER, of William and Mary College, Virginia, and but recently
</p>
<p>deceased, was one of the most trusted friends and devoted partisans
</p>
<p>of Mr. Calhoun, and had he lived till to-day, would have witnessed no

</p>
<p>feeble promise of the complete fulfilment of his own prophecies. The
</p>
<p>circumstances under which &quot; The Partisan Leader&quot; was ushered into
</p>
<p>existence sufficiently indicate its object and character. The manu
</p>
<p>script was placed in the hands of Mr. Calhoun s connexion and con-

<p>Explanatory Introduction. vii
</p>
<p>fidant, DUFF GREEN, then proprietor of the &quot;Telegraph,&quot; published in
</p>
<p>Washington City. It was accordingly printed in Green s office on
</p>
<p>&quot; Capitol Hill,&quot; but with a fictitious imprint, and a false date of twenty
</p>
<p>years in advance, because, as is known from the best living testimony,
</p>
<p>Green confessed the book to be &quot;Treason.&quot; &quot;When the &quot;Partisan
</p>
<p>Leader&quot; was commenced in 1836, it was the intention of its author to
</p>
<p>make it a serial, to be issued at frequent intervals or until the whole
</p>
<p>South should have become impregnated with disunion. But only two
</p>
<p>parts were printed and distributed, because after the election of Mr.
</p>
<p>Van Buren in November 1836, the Secession leaders had resolved
</p>
<p>upon a change of programme from open opposition to the Democracy,
</p>
<p>to a close but treacherous connexion with it. This was effected under
</p>
<p>color of a great admiration for the sub-treasury feature in the Jackson-
</p>
<p>Van Buren policy; at all events Mr. Calhoun and his friends thence
</p>
<p>forward held foremost seats in the Democratic synagogue.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the revolution thus skilfully projected in the
</p>
<p>Partisan Leader is nowhere in the whole book sought to be justified
</p>
<p>on the grounds of alleged aggressions by the North in respect to slav
</p>
<p>ery. Like the abettors of secession on the floors of Congress, Pro
</p>
<p>fessor Tucker seems to have been unable to make out the semblance
</p>
<p>of a good case. After the merest allusion to the grounds for dissolu
</p>
<p>tion, he says in one of the pages of this book
</p>
<p>&quot; If any farther account of the causes of the rebellion be required, 7
</p>
<p>have none to give. It was through the eyes and hearts of the South
</p>
<p>that conviction entered. Outrage to the laws ; outrage to the freedom
</p>
<p>of elections ; outrage to one respected and beloved (Mr. Calhoun), left
</p>
<p>nothing for reason to do.&quot;
</p>
<p>It was in the administration of General Jackson that the Partisan
</p>
<p>Leader found or made motives for the disruption of the Confederacy.
</p>
<p>Negro slavery had not then, nor has it now, any necessary connexion
</p>
<p>with that design.
</p>
<p>&quot;We close this introduction by appending a quotation from an edito
</p>
<p>rial article in the National Intelligencer of January 25th, 1851, in which

<p>the editor, Mr. Gales, had alluded to the remarkable character of this
</p>
<p>political novel, as furnishing a key to some of the profoundcst intrica
</p>
<p>cies in American politics.

</p>
<p>&quot; JTo one,&quot; said Mr. Gales, &quot;who has been familiar with the topics
</p>
<p>and tone of the discussions in the South for the last two years but will
</p>
<p>at once recognise in this fiction a fiction not at all more strange than
</p>
<p>the reality the projected shadow of what has already come to pass.
</p>
<p>From that day to this these defeated partisans have spared no pains
</p>
<p>to make their story come true, by diffusing doubts and discontents into
</p>
<p>the quiet homes as well as the political circles of the South, with a view
</p>
<p>to bring about a revolution, which, had their ambition succeeded,
</p>
<p>would, in its consequences, have desolated those homes, broken up
</p>
<p>those abodes of peace and happiness, and devastated the country with
</p>
<p>the flames of a fierce, unsparing, and unrelenting civil war.&quot;
</p>
<p>Alas, that the revolution which Mr. Gales supposed to have been
</p>
<p>averted by the passage of the Compromise of 1850, should have been
</p>
<p>brought back upon the pathway of our country by the fatal repeal of
</p>
<p>the Missouri Compromise, the abominations and bloodshed in Kansas,

</p>
<p>TO THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA.
</p>
<p>THE part I bore in the transactions which form the
</p>
<p>subject of the following narrative, is my voucher for
</p>
<p>its authenticity. My admiration of the gallant people,
</p>
<p>whose struggle for freedom I witnessed and partook ;
</p>
<p>the cherished friendships contracted among them, at a
</p>
<p>time of life when the heart is warm, and under cir
</p>
<p>cumstances which called all its best feelings into
</p>
<p>action ; and, above all, the connexion then formed,
</p>
<p>which has identified me with Virginia, and which,
</p>
<p>during the last five years, has been the source of all
</p>
<p>my happiness; are my inducements to dedicate this
</p>
<p>work to you. The approbation which, in acknow
</p>
<p>lodging, more than rewarded my humble services, is
</p>
<p>my warrant for hoping, that this tribute of grateful

<p>veneration will be favorably received.

<p>xiv Dedication.
</p>
<p>s.
</p>
<p>Among those whom Virginia, at this time, honors
</p>
<p>with high places in her councils, I see with pride,
</p>
<p>the names of many with whom I once stood, shoulder
</p>
<p>to shoulder, in the eye of danger. Of my regard for
</p>
<p>these, this is not the place to speak, for they are not
</p>
<p>thus to learn my sentiments concerning them. The
</p>
<p>record of their praise, and the reward of their glorious
</p>
<p>deeds, is on the page of history.
</p>
<p>But there are others who will die without their
</p>
<p>fame, and whose names will sink with them into the
</p>
<p>tomb, of whose unpretending devotion to their native
</p>
<p>country I am proud to testify. They belong to that
</p>
<p>class, peculiar to a society whose institutions are based
</p>
<p>on domestic slavery ; the honest, brave, hardy, and
</p>
<p>high-spirited peasantry of Virginia. Among them, I
</p>
<p>saw examples of simple virtue and instinctive patriot
</p>
<p>ism ; and from their lips I heard lessons of that un
</p>
<p>taught wisdom, which finds its place in minds
</p>
<p>uncorrupted by artificial systems of education, and
</p>
<p>undebased by abject and menial occupations. The
</p>
<p>names of Jacob Schwartz and Christian Witt deserve
</p>
<p>to live in history. But the narrative, in which I have
</p>
<p>endeavored to preserve them, will, in after times, be
</p>
<p>classed among romances. Such is the fate of all men,
</p>
<p>whose deeds shame the vaunted achievements of those

<p>Be it so. It is not the less my duty to testify of

<p>what I have witnessed. Eemembering the virtues

<p>which I saw displayed by such, I take pride in dedi

</p>
<p>TOWARD the latter end of the month of October, 1849,
</p>
<p>about the hour of noon, a horseman was seen ascend
</p>
<p>ing a narrow valley at the eastern foot of the Blue
</p>
<p>Eidge. His road nearly followed the course of a small
</p>
<p>stream, which, issuing from a deep gorge of the moun
</p>
<p>tain, winds its way between lofty hills, and terminates
</p>
<p>its brief and brawling course in one of the larger tri
</p>
<p>butaries of the Dan. A glance of the eye took in the
</p>
<p>whole of the little settlement that lined its banks, and
</p>
<p>measured the resources of its inhabitants. The differ

</p>
<p>wliicli the oft repeated brand of the horse-shoe gave
</p>
<p>token of a smithy. There too the rivulet, increased
</p>
<p>by the innumerable springs which afforded to every
</p>
<p>habitation, the unappreciated, but inappreciable luxury
</p>
<p>of water, cold, clear, and sparkling, had gathered
</p>
<p>strength enough to turn a tiny mill. Of trade there
</p>
<p>could be none. The bleak and rugged barrier, which
</p>
<p>closed the scene on the west, and the narrow road,
</p>
<p>fading to a foot-path, gave assurance to the traveller
</p>
<p>that he had here reached the ne plus ultra of social
</p>
<p>life in that direction.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the appearance of discomfort and poverty
</p>
<p>in every dwelling well accorded with the scanty ter
</p>
<p>ritory belonging to each. The walls and chimneys of
</p>
<p>unhewn logs, the roofs of loose boards laid on long
</p>
<p>rib-poles, that projected from the gables, and held
</p>
<p>down by similar poles placed above them, together
</p>
<p>with the smoked and sooty appearance of the whole,
</p>
<p>betokened an abundance of timber, but a dearth of
</p>
<p>everything else. Contiguous to each was a sort of
</p>
<p>rude garden, denominated, in the ruder language of
</p>
<p>the country, a &quot;truck-patch.&quot; Beyond this lay a
</p>
<p>small field, a part of which had produced a crop of
</p>
<p>oats, while on the remainder the Indian corn still
</p>
<p>hung on the stalk, waiting to be gathered. Add to
</p>
<p>this a small meadow, and the reader will have an
</p>
<p>outline equally descriptive of each of the little farms
</p>
<p>which, for the distance of three miles, bordered the
</p>
<p>stream.

</p>
<p>But, though the valley thus bore the marks of a
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 3
</p>
<p>crowded population, a deep stillness pervaded it.
</p>
<p>The visible signs of life were few. Of sounds there
</p>
<p>were none. A solitary youngster, male or female,
</p>
<p>alone was seen loitering about every door. These,
</p>
<p>as the traveller passed along, would skulk from
</p>
<p>observation, and then steal out, and, mounting a
</p>
<p>fence, indulge their curiosity, at safe distances, by
</p>
<p>looking after him.
</p>
<p>At length he heard a sound of voices, and then a
</p>
<p>shrill whistle, and all was still. Immediately, some
</p>
<p>half a dozen men, leaping a fence, ranged them
</p>
<p>selves across the road and faced him. He observed
</p>
<p>that each, as he touched the ground, laid hold of a
</p>
<p>rifle that leaned against the enclosure, and this cir
</p>
<p>cumstance drew his attention to twenty or more ;
</p>
<p>these formidable weapons, ranged along in the same
</p>
<p>position. The first impulse of the traveller was to
</p>
<p>draw a pistol ; but seeing that the men, as they
</p>
<p>posted themselves, rested their guns upon the ground
</p>
<p>and leaned upon them, he quietly withdrew his
</p>
<p>hand from his holster. It was plain that no violence
</p>
<p>w r as intended, and that this movement was nothing
</p>
<p>but a measure of precaution, such as the unsettled
</p>
<p>condition of the country required. He therefore
</p>
<p>advanced steadily but slowly, and, on reaching the
</p>
<p>party, reined in his horse, and silently invited the
</p>
<p>intended parley.
</p>
<p>The men, though somewhat variously attired, were
</p>
<p>all chiefly clad in half-dressed buck-skin. They

</p>
<p>seemed to have been engaged in gathering corn in
</p>
<p>4 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>the adjoining field. Their companions, who still
</p>
<p>continued the same occupation, seemed numerous
</p>
<p>enough (including women and boys, of both of which
</p>
<p>there was a full proportion,) to have secured the
</p>
<p>little crop in a few hours. Indeed, it would seem
</p>
<p>that the whole working population of the neighbor
</p>
<p>hood, both male and female, was assembled there.
</p>
<p>As the traveller drew up his horse, one of the
</p>
<p>men, speaking in a low and quiet tone, said, u We
</p>
<p>want a word with you, stranger, before you go any
</p>
<p>farther.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; As many as you please,&quot; replied the other, &quot; for
</p>
<p>I am tired and hungry, and so is my horse ; and I
</p>
<p>am glad to find some one, at last, of whom I may
</p>
<p>hope to purchase something for both of us to eat.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That you can have quite handy,&quot; said the coun
</p>
<p>tryman, &quot; for we have been gathering corn, and
</p>
<p>were just going to our dinner. If you will only just
</p>
<p>light, sir, one of the boys can feed your horse, and
</p>
<p>you can take such as we have got to give you.&quot;
</p>
<p>The invitation was accepted ; the horse was taken
</p>
<p>in charge by along-legged lad of fifteen, without hat
</p>
<p>or shoes ; and the whole party crossed the fence
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>At the moment, a man was seen advancing toward
</p>
<p>them, who, observing their approach, fell back a few
</p>
<p>steps, and threw himself on the ground at the foot
</p>
<p>of a large old apple-tree. Around this were cluster
</p>
<p>ed a motley group of men, women, and boys, who

<p>opened and made way for the stranger. lie advanced,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. j
</p>
<p>and, bowing gracefully, took off his forage cap, from
</p>
<p>beneath which a quantity of soft curling flaxen hair
</p>
<p>fell over his brow and cheeks. Every eye was now
</p>
<p>fixed on him, with an expression rather of interest
</p>
<p>than mere curiosity. Every countenance was serious
</p>
<p>and composed, and all wore an air of business, ex
</p>
<p>cept that a slight titter was heard among the girls,
</p>
<p>who, hovering behind the backs of their mothers,
</p>
<p>peeped through the crowd, to get a look at the hand
</p>
<p>some stranger.
</p>
<p>He was indeed a handsome youth, about twenty
</p>
<p>years of age, whose fair complexion and regular
</p>
<p>features made him seem yet younger. He was tall,
</p>
<p>slightly, but elegantly formed, with a countenance in
</p>
<p>which softness and spirit were happily blended. His
</p>
<p>dress was plain and cheap, though not unfashionable.
</p>
<p>A short grey coat, waistcoat, and pantaloons, that
</p>
<p>neatly fitted and set off his handsome person, showed
</p>
<p>by the quality of the cloth that his means were limited ;
</p>
<p>or that he had too much sense to waste, in foppery,
</p>
<p>that which might be better expended in the service of
</p>
<p>his suffering country. But, even in this plain dress,
</p>
<p>he was apparelled like a king in comparison with the
</p>
<p>rustics that surrounded him ; and his whole air would
</p>
<p>have passed him for a gentleman, in any dress and
</p>
<p>any company, where the constituents of that character
</p>
<p>are rightly understood.
</p>
<p>In the present assembly there seemed to be none,
</p>
<p>indeed, who could be supposed to have had much

</p>
<p>experience in that line. But dignity is felt, and
</p>
<p>6 The Partisan Leadt
</p>
<p>courtesy appreciated by all, and the expression oi
</p>
<p>frankness and truth is everywhere understood.
</p>
<p>As the youth approached, the man at the foot of the
</p>
<p>tree arose, and returned the salutation, which seemed
</p>
<p>unheeded by the rest. He advanced a step or two,
</p>
<p>and invited the stranger to be seated. This action,
</p>
<p>and the looks turned toward him by the others (
</p>
<p>showed that he was in authority of some sort among
</p>
<p>them. With him, therefore, our traveller concluded
</p>
<p>that the proposed conference was to be held. There
</p>
<p>was nothing in his appearance which would have led
</p>
<p>a careless observer to assign him any pre-eminence.
</p>
<p>But a second glance might have discovered something
</p>
<p>intellectual in his countenance, with less of boorish-
</p>
<p>ness in his air and manner than the rest of the
</p>
<p>-company displayed. In all, indeed, there was the
</p>
<p>negative courtesy of that quiet and serious demeanor
</p>
<p>which solemn occasions impart to the rudest and most
</p>
<p>frivolous. It was plain to see that they had a com
</p>
<p>mon purpose, and that neither ferocity nor rapacity
</p>
<p>entered into their feeling toward the newcomer,
</p>
<p>Whether he was to be treated as a friend or at;
</p>
<p>enemy, obviously depended on some high considera
</p>
<p>tion, not yet disclosed.
</p>
<p>He was at ^ength asked whence he came, and
</p>
<p>answered from the neighborhood of Kichmond.
</p>
<p>From which side of the r.ver? From the north
</p>
<p>side. Did he know anything of Van Courtlandt ?
</p>
<p>His camp was at Bacon s branch, just above the

<p>town. What force had he ?
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 7
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say, certainly,&quot; he replied, &quot; but com
</p>
<p>mon fame made his numbers about four thousand.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Is that all, on both sides of the river? &quot; said his
</p>
<p>interrogator.
</p>
<p>&quot; O, no ! Col. Loyal s regiment is at Petersburg,
</p>
<p>and Col. Cole s at Manchester; each about five
</p>
<p>hundred strong ; and there is a piquet on the Bridge
</p>
<p>island.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Did you cross there ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I did not.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Where then ?&quot; he was asked.
</p>
<p>&quot; I can hardly tell you,&quot; he replied, &quot; it was at a
</p>
<p>private ford, several miles above Cartersville.*&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Was not that mightily out of the way ? What
</p>
<p>made you come so far around?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It was safer travelling on that side of the river. 2
</p>
<p>&quot; Then the people on that side of the river are
</p>
<p>your friends ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; No. They are not. But, as they are all of a
</p>
<p>color there, they would let me pass, and ask no ques
</p>
<p>tions, as long as I travelled due west. On this side,
</p>
<p>if you are one man s friend, you are the next man s
</p>
<p>enemy ; and I had no mind to answer questions.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You seem to answer them now mighty freely.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is true. I am like a letter that tells all it
</p>
<p>knows as soon as it gets to the right hand ; but it
</p>
<p>does not want to be opened before that.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And how do you know that you have got to the
</p>
<p>right hand now ? &quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; Because I know where I am.&quot;
</p>
<p>8 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; And where are you ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Just at the foot of the Devil s Back-bone,&quot; re
</p>
<p>plied the youth.
</p>
<p>&quot; Were you ever here before ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Never in my life.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How do you know then where you are ? &quot; asked
</p>
<p>the mountaineer.
</p>
<p>&quot; Because the right way to avoid questions is to
</p>
<p>ask none. So 1 took care to know all about the
</p>
<p>road, and the country, and the place, before I left
</p>
<p>home.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And who told you all about it? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Suppose I should tell you,&quot; answered the young
</p>
<p>man, &quot; that Yan Courtlandt had a map of the coun
</p>
<p>try made, and gave it to me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I should say, you were a traitor to him, or a spy
</p>
<p>upon us,&quot; was the stern reply.
</p>
<p>At the same moment, a startled hum was heard
</p>
<p>from the crowd, and the press moved and swayed for
</p>
<p>an instant, as if a sort of spasrn had pervaded the
</p>
<p>whole mass.
</p>
<p>&quot; You are a good hand at questioning,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>youth, with a smile, &quot; but, without asking a single
</p>
<p>question, I have found out all I wanted to know.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And what was that ? &quot; asked the other.
</p>
<p>&quot; &quot;Whether you were friends to the Yorkers and
</p>
<p>Yankees, or to poor old Virginia.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;And which are we for?&quot; added the laconic
</p>
<p>mountaineer.

</p>
<p>&quot; For OLD YIKGINIA FOR EVER,&quot; replied the youth,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. g
</p>
<p>in a tone in which exultation rung through a deeper
</p>
<p>emotion, that half stifled his voice.
</p>
<p>It reached the hearts of his auditors, and was
</p>
<p>echoed in a shout that pealed along the mountain
</p>
<p>sides their proud war-cry of &quot; OLD VIRGINIA FOR
</p>
<p>EVEK.&quot; The leader looked around in silence, but
</p>
<p>with a countenance that spoke all that the voices of
</p>
<p>his comrades had uttered.
</p>
<p>&quot; Quiet, boys,&quot; said he, &quot; never shout till the war
</p>
<p>is ended unless it be when you see the enemy.&quot;
</p>
<p>Then turning again to the traveller, he said, &quot; And
</p>
<p>how did you know we were for old Virginia ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I knew it by the place where I find you. 1
</p>
<p>heard it in your voice; 1 saw it in their eyes; and I
</p>
<p>felt it in my heart;&quot; said the young man, extending
</p>
<p>his hand.
</p>
<p>His inquisitor returned the cordial pressure with
</p>
<p>an iron grasp, strong, but not convulsive, and went
</p>
<p>on : &quot; You are a sharp youth,&quot; said he, &quot; and if you
</p>
<p>are of the right metal that will hold an edge, you
</p>
<p>will make somebody feel it. But I don t know
</p>
<p>rightly yet who that is to be, only just I will say,
</p>
<p>that if you are not ready to live and die by old Vir
</p>
<p>ginia, your heart and face are not of the same color,
</p>
<p>that s all.&quot;
</p>
<p>He then resumed his steady look and quiet tone,
</p>
<p>and added, &quot;You must not make me forget what I
</p>
<p>am about. How did you learn the way here ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I can answer that now /&quot; said the youth. U J
</p>

</p>
<p>&quot;True enough;&quot; was the reply. &quot;But I ha^e

<p>&quot; I should like to see his letter.&quot;

<p>&quot;How then?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Go with me to my horse, and I will show you.&quot;
</p>
<p>The youth, accompanied by his interrogator, now
</p>
<p>returned toward the fence. Many of the crowd
</p>
<p>were about to follow ; but the chief (for such he
</p>
<p>seemed) waved them back with a silent motion of
</p>
<p>his hand, while a glance of meaning at two of the
</p>
<p>company invited them to proceed. As soon as the
</p>
<p>stranger reached his horse, he drew out, from
</p>
<p>between the padding and seat of his saddle, a paper
</p>
<p>closely folded. On opening this, it was found^to be
</p>
<p>a map of his route from .Richmond to a point in the
</p>
<p>mountains, a few miles west of the spot where they
</p>
<p>stood. On this were traced the roads and streams,
</p>
<p>with the names of a few places, written in a hand
</p>
<p>which was known to the leader of the mountaineers
</p>
<p>to be that of Captain Douglas. A red line marked

<p>the devious route the traveller had been directed to

<p>pursue.

<p>Lynchburg and Cartersville, to avoid the parties of

<p>taming south, and riding hard all night, he had

<p>crossed the Appomattox above Farmville, (which he

<p>avoided for a like reason,) and, before day, had left

<p>behind him all the hostile posts and scouting par-

</p>
<p>RETURNING to the party which they had left, they
</p>
<p>found the women in the act of placing their meal
</p>
<p>before them, under the apple-tree. There was a
</p>
<p>patch of grass there, but no shade ; nor was any
</p>
<p>needed in that lofty region ; the frost had already
</p>
<p>done its work by stripping the trees of their leaves,
</p>
<p>and letting in the welcome rays of the sun through
</p>
<p>the naked branches. The meal consisted of fresh
</p>
<p>pork and venison, roasted or broiled on the coals,
</p>
<p>which looked tempting enough, though served up
</p>
<p>in wooden trays. There were no knives but such
</p>
<p>as each hunter carries in his belt. Our traveller s
</p>
<p>dirk supplied the place of one to him. Their plates
</p>
<p>were truly classical, consisting of cakes of Indian
</p>
<p>corn, baked in the ashes, so that, like the soldiers of
</p>
<p>^Eneas, each man ate up his platter before his hun
</p>
<p>ger was appeased.

<p>perceiving a woful insipidity in his food, for which

</p>
<p>When the meal was finished, our traveller, express
</p>
<p>ing a due sense of the courtesy of his entertainers,
</p>
<p>asked what was to pay, and proposed to continue his
</p>
<p>journey.
</p>
<p>&quot; As to what you are to pay, my friend,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>spokesman of the party, in the same cold, quiet tone,
</p>
<p>&quot; that is just nothing. If you come here by Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas s invitation, you are one of us ; and if you
</p>
<p>do not, we are bound to find you as long as we keep
</p>
<p>you. But, as to your going just yet, it is quite
</p>
<p>against our rules.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How is that ?&quot; asked the traveller, with some
</p>
<p>expression of impatience.
</p>
<p>&quot;That is what I cannot tell you,&quot; replied the other.
</p>
<p>&quot; But what right,&quot; exclaimed the youth then
</p>
<p>checking himself, he added : &quot; But I see you mean
</p>
<p>nothing but what is right and prudent ; and you must
</p>
<p>take your own way to find out all you wish to know
</p>
<p>about me. But I thought you said you did not

<p>doubt me.&quot;
</p>
<p>14 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; No more I do,&quot; replied the other ; &quot; but that is
</p>
<p>not the thing. May be, our rules are not satisfied,
</p>
<p>though I am.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; An J what are your rules ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It is against rule to tell them,&quot; said the moun
</p>
<p>taineer, dryly. &quot; But make yourself easy, stranger.
</p>
<p>We mean you no harm, and I will see and have
</p>
<p>every thing laid straight before sun-rise. You are
</p>
<p>heartily welcome. Such as we ve got we give you ;
</p>
<p>and that is better than you will find where you are
</p>
<p>going. For our parts, except it be for salt, we are
</p>
<p>about as well off here as common ; because there is
</p>
<p>little else we use that comes from foreign parts. I
</p>
<p>dare say, it will go hard with you for a while, sir ;
</p>
<p>but, if your heart s right, you will not mind it, and
</p>
<p>you will soon get used to it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a great shame,&quot; said the youth, &quot;if I
</p>
<p>cannot bear for a while what you have borne for life.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the other, &quot;that is the way people
</p>
<p>talk. .But (axing your pardon, sir,) there an t no
</p>
<p>sense in it. Because the longer a man bears a thing,
</p>
<p>the less he minds it ; and after a while, it an t no
</p>
<p>hardship at all. And that s the way ivith the poor
</p>
<p>negroes that the Yankees pretend to be so sorry for,
</p>
<p>and tried to get them to rise against their masters.
</p>
<p>There s few of them, stranger, but what s happier
</p>
<p>than I am ; but I should be mighty unhappy, if you
</p>
<p>were to catch me now, in my old days, and make a
</p>
<p>slave of me. jSo when the Yankees want to set the

</p>
<p>negroes free, and to make me a slave, they want to put

</p>
<p>us both to what we are not fit for. And so it will be
</p>
<p>with you for a while, among these mountains, sleep
</p>
<p>ing on the ground, and eating your meat without salt,
</p>
<p>or bread either, may be. But after a while you will
</p>
<p>not mind it. But as to whether it is to be long or
</p>
<p>short, young man, you must not think about that.
</p>
<p>You have no business here, if you have not made up
</p>
<p>your mind to stand the like of that for life ; and may
</p>
<p>be that not so mighty long neither.&quot;
</p>
<p>At this moment a signal from the road gave notice
</p>
<p>of the approach of a traveller ; and the leader of the
</p>
<p>mountaineers, accompanied by his guest, went for
</p>
<p>ward in obedience to it. But, before he reached the
</p>
<p>fence, he saw several of the party leap it, and run
</p>
<p>eagerly forward to meet the new-comer. A little man
</p>
<p>now appeared, walking slowly and wearily, whose
</p>
<p>dress differed but little from that of the natives ; and
</p>
<p>who bore, like them, a rifle, with its proper accompa
</p>
<p>niments of knife, tomahawk, and powder-horn. His
</p>
<p>arrival awakened a tumult of joy among the younger
</p>
<p>persons present, while he whom I have designated as
</p>
<p>the chief stood still, looking toward him with a coun
</p>
<p>tenance in which an expression of thoughtful interest
</p>
<p>was mingled with a sort of quiet satisfaction, and great
</p>
<p>kindness and good will. Yet he moved but a step to
</p>
<p>meet him, and extending his hand, said, in his usual
</p>
<p>cold tone, &quot; How is it, Schwartz ?&quot; to which the
</p>
<p>other, in a voice somewhat more cheeiy, replied
</p>
<p>&quot;Well; how is it with you, Witt?&quot;

</p>
<p>the grave answer.
</p>
<p>iO The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>The two now drew apart to converse privately to*
</p>
<p>gether. Crossing the road, they seated themsel ves on
</p>
<p>the fence in front of the stranger, so that during their
</p>
<p>conference they could keep an eye on him.
</p>
<p>&quot; Who is this you have got here?&quot; asked Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; A young fellow that says he wants to go to the
</p>
<p>camp,&quot; replied the other.
</p>
<p>&quot; Has he got the word and signs? 1
</p>
<p>&quot; No. He does not know any thing about it. I
</p>
<p>have a notion he is a friend of the captain s.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What makes you think so?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He has got a paper in the captain s hand- write to
</p>
<p>show him the way. But there s no name to it ; and
</p>
<p>if there was, I could not tell that he was the man.
</p>
<p>Sure and certain the captain wrote the paper, but then
</p>
<p>somebody may have stolen it. A man that knows as
</p>
<p>much about the country as he does, after looking at
</p>
<p>that paper and travelling by it away here, is the last
</p>
<p>man we ought to let go any farther, or know any
</p>
<p>more, unless he is of the right sort.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I should like to see that paper ;&quot; said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; Here it is,&quot; replied his companion. &quot; I don t
</p>
<p>much mistrust the young fellow ; but I did not like
</p>
<p>to let him have it again till I knew more.&quot;
</p>
<p>Schwartz now looked at the paper and inquired the
</p>
<p>stranger s name.
</p>
<p>&quot; I did not ask his name,&quot; said Witt, &quot; because
</p>
<p>he could just tell me what name he pleased. As
</p>
<p>there was no name on the paper, it did not make

</p>
<p>any odds. Besides, I wanted to be civil to him,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 17
</p>
<p>and your high gentlemen down about Richmond
</p>
<p>are affronted sometimes if yon ask their names.
</p>
<p>The young fellow is all right, or all wrong, any
</p>
<p>how ; and his name don t make any odds. If the
</p>
<p>captain knows him, when he sees him, it s all one
</p>
<p>what his name is.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But I know,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot; who ought tc
</p>
<p>have that paper; and if he don t answer to that
</p>
<p>name it s no use troubling the captain with him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I should be sorry for any harm to him,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Witt, &quot; for he is a smart lad ; and if he is not a true
</p>
<p>Yirginian, then he is the greatest hypocrfte that
</p>
<p>ever was born.&quot;
</p>
<p>They now recrossed the road, and Schwartz,
</p>
<p>addressing the stranger, said, &quot; I must make so bold,
</p>
<p>young man, as to ask your name.&quot;
</p>
<p>The young fellow colored, and, turning to Witt,
</p>
<p>said, &quot; I thought you were satisfied, and done asking
</p>
<p>questions.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; So I was,&quot; said Witt, &quot; but there is a reason for
</p>
<p>asking your name now, that I did not know of. I
</p>
<p>owe you nothing but good will, young man,&quot; added
</p>
<p>he with earnest solicitude ; &quot; and if your name is
</p>
<p>what I hope it is, be sure by all means and tell the
</p>
<p>truth ; for there is but one name in the world tliat
</p>
<p>will save your neck.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Then -I shall tell you no name at all,&quot; rejoined
</p>
<p>the youth, somewhat appalled at this startling
</p>
<p>intimation. &quot; Why did not you ask me at once,

</p>
<p>when I was in the humor to keep nothing from
</p>
<p>l8 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>you. I was willing to answer any civil question,
</p>
<p>or indeed any question you would have put to me,
</p>
<p>but 1 will not submit to be examined, over and
</p>
<p>over, by every chance-comer.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; There s where you are wrong, young man,&quot;
</p>
<p>replied Witt. &quot; This is no chance-comer. He is
</p>
<p>my head man, and I am just nobody when he is
</p>
<p>here.&quot;
</p>
<p>Surprised at this ascription of authority to the
</p>
<p>diminutive and mean-looking new-comer, our tra
</p>
<p>veller looked at him again, and was confirmed in a
</p>
<p>resolut&n to resist it. He had patiently borne to
</p>
<p>be questioned by Witt, who had something of an
</p>
<p>air of dignity. He was a tall, clean-limbed, and
</p>
<p>powerful man, of about forty, remarkable for the
</p>
<p>sobriety of his demeanor, and the thoughtful gravity
</p>
<p>of his countenance. The other was a little, old
</p>
<p>fellow, not less than sixty years of age, in whose
</p>
<p>manner and carriage there was nothing to supply
</p>
<p>the want of dignity in his diminutive form and
</p>
<p>features. A sharp little black eye was the only
</p>
<p>point about him to attract attention ; and in that
</p>
<p>the youth thought he saw an impertinent and know
</p>
<p>ing twinkle, which rendered his inquiries yet more
</p>
<p>offensive.
</p>
<p>&quot;I thought,&quot; said he to Witt, &quot;that Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas was your captain.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;So he is,&quot; was his reply. &quot; That is, he commands
</p>
<p>all here. But that is only so long as we choose. I

<p>did not tell you this was my captain. He is uc
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 19
</p>
<p>captain, nor lieutenant, nor ensign neither. But all of
</p>
<p>us here follow him ; and, when he is away, the rest
</p>
<p>follow me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;You all follow him!&quot; said the traveller, looking
</p>
<p>contemptuously on the puny figure before him.
</p>
<p>&quot; To be sure they do;&quot; said Schwartz, with a quiz
</p>
<p>zical smile, and answering the stranger s thoughts.
</p>
<p>&quot; To be sure they do. Don t you see I am the like
</p>
<p>liest man here?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say I do,&quot; said the youth, offended at
</p>
<p>the impertinent manner of the question.
</p>
<p>&quot; Well, I am the strongest man in the whole com
</p>
<p>pany.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I should hardly think that ;&quot; replied the traveller,
</p>
<p>scornfully.
</p>
<p>&quot;Any how, then, I am the biggest,&quot; rejoined
</p>
<p>Schwartz, laughing. &quot; That you must own. What !
</p>
<p>do you dispute that too? Well then, look here,
</p>
<p>stranger ! I ha nt got no commission, and these men
</p>
<p>are as free as I am. What do you think makes them
</p>
<p>obey my orders ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I really cannot say,&quot; replied the young man.
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot; it is a curious business,
</p>
<p>and well worth your considering : because, you see,
</p>
<p>I have a notion if you could find that out, you would
</p>
<p>find out a pretty good reason why you ought to tell
</p>
<p>me your name. But that is your business. Some
</p>
<p>name you must have, and the right one too. And
</p>
<p>you see, stranger, it makes no odds whether it is no

</p>
<p>name or the wrong one. It is all the same thing ;
</p>
<p>20 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>because, if you are the man that ought to have that
</p>
<p>paper, you would tell your name in a minute.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Do you know who ought to have it ?&quot; asked the
</p>
<p>youth.
</p>
<p>&quot;May be I do,&quot; said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot;Question for question,&quot; said the other. &quot;Do you
</p>
<p>know ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I do.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well, then, my name is Arthur Trevor. Is that
</p>
<p>right?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That s as it may be,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot; But now
</p>
<p>I want to know how you came by this paper.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What need you care about that, if I am the per
</p>
<p>son that ought to have it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Just because I want to know if you are the one
</p>
<p>that ought to have it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I tell you,&quot; replied the youth, &quot; that my name is
</p>
<p>Arthur Trevor.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But /do not know that it is,&quot; replied Schwartz,
</p>
<p>carelessly.
</p>
<p>&quot; Do you doubt my word, then ?&quot; exclaimed the
</p>
<p>youth ; his eye flashing, and the blood rushing to his
</p>
<p>face, as if it would burst through his clear skin.
</p>
<p>&quot; Look here, stranger,&quot; said Schwartz, in a tone of
</p>
<p>quiet expostulation ; &quot;I don t mean no offence, and
</p>
<p>you ll think so too, if you ll just look at it rightly ;
</p>
<p>because, you see, I don t know who you are. I don t
</p>
<p>doubt Arthur Trevor s word ; and, if you are Arthur
</p>
<p>Trevor, I don t doubt your word. Now, if you have

</p>
<p>any way to show that you are Arthur Trevor, you
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 21
</p>
<p>have but to do it, and it will set all as straight as if I
</p>
<p>had axed you ten thousand pardons.&quot;
</p>
<p>u But I have no means of showing it,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>young man, in some perplexity. &quot; I took care to
</p>
<p>bring nothing with me to show who I am. The name
</p>
<p>of Trevor might have brought me into trouble in
</p>
<p>some parts of the country.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is true enough,&quot; replied Schwartz ; &quot; and
</p>
<p>so I asked you how you came by the paper, because
</p>
<p>T knew how Arthur Trevor should have come by it ;
</p>
<p>and, if you got it that way, why then you are the
</p>
<p>very man.&quot;
</p>
<p>By this time the youth saw the folly of his anger,
</p>
<p>and answered, calmly, that he got it from a man he
</p>
<p>never saw before.
</p>
<p>&quot; What sort of a man was he ?&quot; asked Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; Nothing uncommon, except that he was lame.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Did he give you anything else at the same
</p>
<p>time ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Yes ; he gave me this ; &quot; said the youth, produc
</p>
<p>ing a dirty piece of paper, on which were scrawled
</p>
<p>these words :
</p>
<p>&quot; Sur. If you hav occashun to go of a jurney,
</p>
<p>carry this with you, bekase it mout be of sum sarvice
</p>
<p>to you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot; that will do. You are
</p>
<p>Arthur Trevor, sure enough. And I reckon, Witt,
</p>
<p>you would have said so too, if you had seen this.&quot;
</p>
<p>Witt looked at the paper, and merely nodded as

<p>sent.
</p>
<p>22 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; said the young man, &quot; now I suppose I
</p>
<p>may go on to my friend.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Not just yet,&quot; said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; Why so?&quot; asked the youth, again relapsing into
</p>
<p>petulance.
</p>
<p>&quot; Just because you could not get there,&quot; was the
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>&quot; Why not,&quot; said he, &quot; after finding my way thus
</p>
<p>far?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; For the same reason that you could not have got
</p>
<p>any farther if I had not come. You would meet
</p>
<p>with rougher customers than these between here and
</p>
<p>the camp. Come, come, my son. You must learn
</p>
<p>to take things easy. The captain has not got a bet
</p>
<p>ter friend than me in the world ; nor you neither, if
</p>
<p>you did but know all. And, you see, you are going
</p>
<p>to a new trade ; and I thought I would just give you
</p>
<p>a lesson. Now you may see, that, when you mean
</p>
<p>nothing but what is fair and honorable, (and you
</p>
<p>always know how that is,) the naked truth is your
</p>
<p>best friend ; and then, the sooner it comes the better.
</p>
<p>I am pretty much of an old fox ; and I reckon I have
</p>
<p>told more lies than you ever dreamed of, but, for all
</p>
<p>that, I bave seen the day when the truth was better
</p>
<p>than the cunningest lie that ever was told. And then
</p>
<p>again, it an t no use to mind what a man says when
</p>
<p>he don t know you ; because, you see, it an t you he
</p>
<p>is talking to, but just a stranger.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But I have travelled desperate hard to-day,

<p>Witt,&quot; continued Schwartz ; &quot; and I must push on to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 23
</p>
<p>the camp to-night. So just give me a mouthful, and
</p>
<p>I ll be off, and pilot Mr. Trevor through among the
</p>
<p>guards.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; My horse is at your service, as you are tired,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Arthur, whose feelings toward his new acquaintance
</p>
<p>were now quite mollified.
</p>
<p>&quot;I have had riding enough for one day,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Schwartz ; &quot; and was glad enough to get to where I
</p>
<p>could leave my horse. It an t much good a horse will
</p>
<p>do you, or me either, where we are going. By the
</p>
<p>time we climb to the top of the Devil s Backbone,
</p>
<p>you ll be more tired than me ; and the horse will be
</p>
<p>worst off of any.&quot;
</p>
<p>He now told one of the boys to make ready Ar
</p>
<p>thur s horse, and, snatching a hasty morsel, seized his
</p>
<p>rifle. &quot; It will not do,&quot; said he, &quot; to starve when a
</p>
<p>man is on fatigue, and it will not do to eat too much.
</p>
<p>And see here, Witt,&quot; added he, taking him apart, and
</p>
<p>speaking in a low tone, &quot; if a long-legged, red-headed
</p>
<p>fellow comes along here, and tells you he is from Cur-
</p>
<p>rituck, and seems to think he knows all the signs,
</p>
<p>never let him find out but what he does. Only just
</p>
<p>make an excuse to keep him a while, and send a run
</p>
<p>ner on to me, that I may have time to get out of the
</p>
<p>way, because he must not see me. Then you can
</p>
<p>start him off again with a couple of fellows to show

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>The forest s shady scene,

<p>Where things that own not man s dominion dwell,
</p>
<p>And mortal foot hath ne er or rarely been.
</p>
<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>THE travellers now moved off together, Arthur
</p>
<p>walking, and leading his horse. They soon reached
</p>
<p>a point where a sharp ridge, jutting like a buttress
</p>
<p>from the side of the mountain, came down abruptly
</p>
<p>to the very bank of the rivulet. Up this ridge, not
</p>
<p>unaptly called &quot;the Devil s Back-bone,&quot; the path
</p>
<p>led. Leaning, as it were, against the mountain its
</p>
<p>position, the narrow, ridgy edge along which the
</p>
<p>traveller clambered, arid the rough nodules which
</p>
<p>interrupted the ascent, like the notches in a hen s
</p>
<p>ladder, gave it no small resemblance to this house
</p>
<p>wifely contrivance. The steep descent on either
</p>
<p>hand into deep dells, craggy and hirsute with stinted
</p>
<p>trees bristling from the sides, together with the
</p>
<p>similarity of these same nodules to the joints of the
</p>
<p>spine, had suggested a name strictly descriptive of
</p>
<p>the place. The ruggedness, steepness, and vast
</p>
<p>height of the ascent, would naturally provoke some

<p>spiteful epithet; and were the spot to be named
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 25
</p>
<p>again, a hundred to one it would receive the same
</p>
<p>name, and no other.
</p>
<p>At the summit of this narrow stair, the travellers
</p>
<p>stopped to take breath, and look back on the scene
</p>
<p>below. Arthur, who was at the romantic age when
</p>
<p>young men are taught to affect an enthusiasm for
</p>
<p>the beauties of nature, and to prate about hues and
</p>
<p>scents, and light and shade, and prospects in all the
</p>
<p>variety of the grand, the beautiful, and the pictu
</p>
<p>resque, had been feasting his imagination with the
</p>
<p>thought of the glorious view to be seen from the
</p>
<p>pinnacle before him. Like an epicure about to
</p>
<p>feast on turtle, who will not taste a biscuit before
</p>
<p>hand lest he should spoil his dinner, so our young
</p>
<p>traveller steadily kept his face toward the hill as
</p>
<p>ae ascended it. Even when he stopped to take
</p>
<p>breath, he was careful not to look behind. Schwartz,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, who was in advance, always faced
</p>
<p>about on such occasions, filling the pauses with
</p>
<p>conversation, and looking as if unconscious of the
</p>
<p>glorious scene over which his eye glanced unheed
</p>
<p>ing. Arthur was vexed to see such indifference,
</p>
<p>and wondered whether this was the effect of use, or
</p>
<p>of the total absence of a faculty of which poets so
</p>
<p>much delight to speak.
</p>
<p>At length the summit was attained ; and now the
</p>
<p>youth looked around in anticipated exultation. At
</p>
<p>first he felt bound to admire, and, forgetting the
</p>
<p>unromantic character of his matter-of-fact compa

</p>
<p>nion, exclaimed : &quot; Oh ! how grand ! how beautiful 1&quot;
</p>
<p>26 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; For my part,&quot; said Schwartz, indifferently, &quot; I
</p>
<p>cannot say that I see any thing at all rightly, except
</p>
<p>it be the little branch down there, with its patches
</p>
<p>of meadow and corn-fields, and its smoky cabins.
</p>
<p>In the spring of the year, when you cannot see the
</p>
<p>cabins for the shaders, and the corn, and oats, and
</p>
<p>meadow is all of a color, it looks mightily like a
</p>
<p>little green snake. What it is like just now, I cannot
</p>
<p>say, as I never saw one of them snakes half-scaled,
</p>
<p>and with a parcel of warts on his back : but I have
</p>
<p>a notion he would look pretty much so. As to any
</p>
<p>thing else there is something there, to be sure, but
</p>
<p>what it is, I am sartain I could never tell, if I did
</p>
<p>not know. And as to the distance I hear some
</p>
<p>folks talk about why the farther you look, the less
</p>
<p>you see, that s all ; until you get away yonder,
</p>
<p>t other side of nowhere ; and then you see just no
</p>
<p>thing at all.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But the vastness of the view !&quot; said Arthur.
</p>
<p>&quot; The idea of immensity !&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; As to that,&quot; replied Schwartz, &quot; you have only
</p>
<p>just to look up, and you can look a heap farther,
</p>
<p>and still see nothing. All the difference is, you
</p>
<p>know it is nothing ; and down there, you know there
</p>
<p>is something, and you cannot see what it is.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am afraid your eyes are bad,&quot; said Arthur.
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot see as well as I could once,&quot; replied
</p>
<p>Schwartz ; &quot; but if there was anything to be seen
</p>
<p>down there, I should be right apt to see it. I have

<p>clomb this hill, Mr. Trevor, when I could see the
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 27
</p>
<p>head of a nail in a target fifty yards off, and drive
</p>
<p>it with my rifle ; and I don t think I saw any thing
</p>
<p>more then than I do now ; and that is only just be
</p>
<p>cause there an t nothing there to see. egad ! but
</p>
<p>there is } though ! There s that chap a coming
</p>
<p>along ; and I must see the Captain, and tell him all
</p>
<p>about it before he comes.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I see nobody,&quot; said Arthur.
</p>
<p>&quot; That is because you don t look in the right
</p>
<p>place,&quot; replied Schwartz. &quot; Look along the road.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t see the road, except just at the foot of
</p>
<p>the mountain.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well ! Look through the sights of my rifle.
</p>
<p>There ! Don t you see a man on horseback ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I see something moving, 1 said Arthur ; &quot; but I
</p>
<p>cannot tell what it is.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot; when he comes, you ll
</p>
<p>see it s a man riding on a white horse, and then, may
</p>
<p>be, you ll think if there was anything else there, I
</p>
<p>could see that too.&quot;
</p>
<p>He now sounded a small whistle, which hung by
</p>
<p>a leathern thong from his shoulder-belt. The signal
</p>
<p>was answered from the point of a projecting crag
</p>
<p>which jutted out from the face of the cliff, not more
</p>
<p>than fifty yards off. At the same moment, a man
</p>
<p>was seen to rise up from behind a rock, which had
</p>
<p>hitherto concealed him ; though, from his look-out
</p>
<p>place, he must have had a distinct view of our tra
</p>
<p>vellers from the moment they left the valley. He

</p>
<p>now approached and accosted Schwartz in a ma-nnei
</p>
<p>28 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>winch showed that he had already recognized him.
</p>
<p>Schwartz returned the salutation, and, pointing out
</p>
<p>the man on the white horse, said : &quot; If that fellow
</p>
<p>should happen to get by without their seeing him, I
</p>
<p>want you just to fall in with him, like as if you was
</p>
<p>a hunting, and so go with him to the piquet. Never
</p>
<p>let on but he knows all the signs, and keep with
</p>
<p>him : and when you get him to the piquet, make
</p>
<p>him believe that is the camp, and that the Captain
</p>
<p>will be there after a while ; and so keep him there
</p>
<p>till the Captain comes.&quot;
</p>
<p>Having said this, he again turned his eye toward
</p>
<p>the object moving below, and gazed intently for a
</p>
<p>few minutes. Arthur, in the mean time, was left to
</p>
<p>admire the prospect, and soon began to suspect that
</p>
<p>Schwartz s ideas of the picturesque were not so far
</p>
<p>wrong. Indeed, there is nothing to admire from the
</p>
<p>spot, but the road that leads to it. From the foot of
</p>
<p>the mountain to the coast, there is an expanse of
</p>
<p>nearly three hundred miles, with no secondary ridges.
</p>
<p>As seen from that elevation, the whole is level to tho
</p>
<p>eye, and presents one sheet of unbroken forest. Artl inr
</p>
<p>found time to correct his preconceptions by the testi
</p>
<p>mony of his own senses, while Schwartz continued to
</p>
<p>observe the movements of the distant traveller. At
</p>
<p>last he said : &quot; That will do. They have stopped
</p>
<p>him ; and he will not get away to-night&quot;
</p>
<p>They now moved on quietly through a forest of
</p>
<p>lofty chestnuts, and along a path which wound its

</p>
<p>way among the scorched trunks of innumerable trees,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 29
</p>
<p>prostrated by the fires that annually sweep through
</p>
<p>such uninhabited tracts. The soil seemed fertile,
</p>
<p>and abounding in luxuriant though coarse pasturage ;
</p>
<p>and the high table-land of the mountain was more
</p>
<p>level than the peopled district below. Yet all was
</p>
<p>solitary and silent; nor was a vestige of habitation
</p>
<p>seen for miles. On inquiring the cause of this, Arthur
</p>
<p>was told that the country, at that elevation, was too
</p>
<p>cold to be inviting, as nothing would grow there but
</p>
<p>grass and oats, and that it was all shingled over with
</p>
<p>conflicting patents.
</p>
<p>&quot;They that claim the land,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot;will
</p>
<p>not go to law about it with one another; because
</p>
<p>they would have to survey it, and that would cost a
</p>
<p>mint of money ; so they all club to keep it as a sum
</p>
<p>mer range for their stock. It belongs to some of
</p>
<p>them, and that is enough.&quot;
</p>
<p>He had not long done speaking, when he suddenly
</p>
<p>stopped, and, raising his rifle, fired, and began quietly
</p>
<p>to load again.
</p>
<p>&quot;What did you shoot at?&quot; asked Arthur, looking
</p>
<p>in the direction of the shot.
</p>
<p>&quot; A monstrous fine buck,&quot; replied Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; Where is he? I did not see him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You did not look in the right place. He is down
</p>
<p>and kicking ; and I always like to load my gun before
</p>
<p>I go up to them, because, you sec, a deer, when he is
</p>
<p>wounded, is as dangerous as a^amter.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; A painter /&quot; said Arthur. &quot; What harm is there

<p>in a painter, more than another man ?&quot;
</p>
<p>30 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; !&quot; said Schwartz, laughing, &quot; it an t no man at
</p>
<p>all. I don t just rightly know how you high larnt
</p>
<p>gentlemen call his name, but he is as ugly a varmint
</p>
<p>as you d wish to see ; most like a big cat. Sometimes
</p>
<p>the drotted Yankees gets hold of them and puts them
</p>
<p>in a cage ; and then they call them tigers. Egad ! I
</p>
<p>catched a young one once and sold him to one of
</p>
<p>these fellows; and the next time I seed him, he was
</p>
<p>carrying the creetur about with him for a show. And
</p>
<p>he did not remember me ; and so I axed him what it
</p>
<p>was ; and he said twas an Effrican tiger right from
</p>
<p>Duck river ! Lord ! how the folks did laugh ; cause
</p>
<p>you see, sir, Duck river is just a little way down here
</p>
<p>in Tennessee, not over five hundred miles off; and
</p>
<p>Effrica, they tell me, is away t other side of the her
</p>
<p>ring-pond, where the negurs come from.&quot;
</p>
<p>By this time the rifle was loaded, and they advanced
</p>
<p>toward the fallen deer. They were quite near before
</p>
<p>Arthur discovered him ; and, at the moment, the ani
</p>
<p>mal (a noble buck of ten branches) recovered himself
</p>
<p>so far as to regain his feet. He still staggered, but
</p>
<p>the sudden sight of his enemy seemed, at once, to
</p>
<p>stiffen his limbs with horror, and give them strength
</p>
<p>to support him. In an instant his formidable antlers
</p>
<p>were pointed ; and, with eyes glaring and blood-shot,
</p>
<p>and his hair all turned the wrong way, he was in act
</p>
<p>to spring forward. At the instant, the report of the
</p>
<p>rifle was again heard, and, pitching on the points of
</p>
<p>his horns, he turned fairly heels over head, and lay

</p>
<p>with his legs in air, and quivering in death. Schwartz
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 31
</p>
<p>now drew his knife across the animal s throat, and
</p>
<p>proceeded to disembowel him, when Arthur asked
</p>
<p>what he would do with the carcass.
</p>
<p>&quot;I ll just hang him up in a sapling.&quot; said he, &quot;till
</p>
<p>I meet one of our men. There ought to be one close
</p>
<p>by, and I can send him for him. Where there s a
</p>
<p>hundred mouths to feed, such a buck as this is a cash
</p>
<p>article.&quot;
</p>
<p>At this moment, the snapping of a dry stick caught
</p>
<p>his ear ; and, looking up, he saw a man approaching.
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t know that fellow,&quot; said he, looking hard
</p>
<p>at him. &quot; But it s all one. I can make him know
</p>
<p>me.&quot;
</p>
<p>The usual salutation now passed, and the stranger
</p>
<p>said : &quot; If I may be so bold, stranger, I d be glad to
</p>
<p>know what parts you are from ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; From Passamaquoddy,&quot; said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; Can you tell me the price of skins down there
</p>
<p>away ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Twenty-five cents and a quarter a pound,&quot; replied
</p>
<p>Schwartz.
</p>
<p>A few more simple questions and out-of-the-way
</p>
<p>answers were exchanged, when Schwartz, addressing
</p>
<p>the other, in an under tone, said : &quot; You are one of
</p>
<p>the new recruits, I reckon?&quot; The other nodded; and
</p>
<p>Schwartz went on to ask their number. Being told
</p>
<p>they were fifty, he said, gravely : &quot; &quot;Now, there you
</p>
<p>are wrong. You are right enough to pass me, after
</p>
<p>I gave you the word ; but that s no reason you

</p>
<p>should tell me anything. I just asked you, you see,
</p>
<p>32 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>to give you a caution ; cause a fellow might come
</p>
<p>along here that would give you the word as straight
</p>
<p>as any body, and be a spy all the time. So the
</p>
<p>right way would be, just to pass him and keep dark,
</p>
<p>that s the rule ; and, by the time he d find out how
</p>
<p>many men we ve got, may be he d find out some
</p>
<p>thing else he would not like quite so well. But
</p>
<p>come, let us take the deer up the road, and you can
</p>
<p>walk your post and watch it, till I can send some
</p>
<p>body for it from the piquet.&quot;
</p>
<p>The sturdy mountaineer at once shouldered the
</p>
<p>animal ; and, striding along to the road, threw him
</p>
<p>down, and quietly betook himself to eating the
</p>
<p>chestnuts that covered the ground. The traveller
</p>
<p>moved on, and presently came to the piquet.
</p>
<p>Here was a small party quartered in a rude and
</p>
<p>ruinous cabin, near which was an enclosure around
</p>
<p>a beautiful fountain, that welled up from a natural
</p>
<p>basin of stone. In this were confined twenty or
</p>
<p>thirty calves. A few horses were piqueted at hand,
</p>
<p>and the sides of the adjoining hills were covered
</p>
<p>with a numerous herd of fat cattle, browsing on the
</p>
<p>faded, but still succulent vegetation. The time was
</p>
<p>come when they should have been driven down for
</p>
<p>the winter, to the farms of their owners below, but
</p>
<p>they were left here that the men might have the use
</p>
<p>of their milk. Should the hunting at any time
</p>
<p>prove unsuccessful, there was always a beef at hand.
</p>
<p>Here Schwartz was known, and joyfully wel

</p>
<p>comed. He stopped only to tell of the deer, and
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 3^
</p>
<p>moved on. &quot; You have a curious system here,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Arthur ; &quot; I see the people here know you, but how
</p>
<p>did you manage with that new recruit? I watched
</p>
<p>you, and I did not see you give him any sign, ami
</p>
<p>lie did not ask for a countersign.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is all because you don t know what foolish
</p>
<p>answers I gave to his questions. You see, we ha nt
</p>
<p>got no countersign rightly ; cause you see, when I
</p>
<p>stop a man, I want to know who he is, but I don t
</p>
<p>want to tell him anything about myself. But if I
</p>
<p>ax a man for the countersign, just so I might as well
</p>
<p>tell him I am on guard at once. So we ve just got,
</p>
<p>may be, twenty simple questions ; and when we ask
</p>
<p>them, our own folks know what answer to give, and
</p>
<p>the answer is sure to be one that nobody would give
</p>
<p>unless he was in the secret.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And pray how did you find out that I was
</p>
<p>Arthur Trevor ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; O ! nothing easier, sir. That man that gave you
</p>
<p>the map was not no, more lame than you. But I
</p>
<p>told him to be sure and not give it to nobody but
</p>
<p>you, and then to limp so as you d be sure to notice
</p>
<p>it. You see, it was I that was to try fall in with
</p>
<p>you, and pilot you ; but, after that, I got up another
</p>
<p>scheme. As to the other paper, that was to serve
</p>
<p>you with our folks, because there was a mark there
</p>
<p>you did not notice, that any of them would know ;
</p>
<p>and then they would be middling sure you were the
</p>
<p>man you said you were. They would have been
</p>
<p>civil to you, and let you pass, but then they would

<p>34 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>have sent a man or two to the camp with yon. And
</p>
<p>now, Mr. Trevor, here is something that I can see,
</p>
<p>and I have a notion it s worth looking at.&quot;
</p>
<p>While he was yet speaking, Arthur s ears had
</p>
<p>been saluted by a brawling sound, which he now
</p>
<p>recognized as the rush of water. Turning his head
</p>
<p>towards it, he perceived that it proceeded from a
</p>
<p>deep and shaggy dell, which the path was now
</p>
<p>approaching, and along the verge of which it pre
</p>
<p>sently wound. Here the plain broke sheer down
</p>
<p>into a gulph of vast depth, at the bottom of which
</p>
<p>a considerable stream was seen. It dashed rapidly
</p>
<p>along, pouring its sparkling waters over successive
</p>
<p>barriers of yellow rock, that sent up a golden gleam
</p>
<p>from beneath the crystal sheet that covered them.
</p>
<p>The mountain-pine, the fir, the kalmia, and number
</p>
<p>less other evergreens, which nearly filled the gorge,
</p>
<p>afforded only occasional glimpses of the water ;
</p>
<p>while they set off the picturesque appearance of so
</p>
<p>much as they permitted to be seen. As they ad
</p>
<p>vanced, they came to a part where the trees had
</p>
<p>been cut from the brow of the cliff; and, several of
</p>
<p>those below having been removed, a clearer view
</p>
<p>was afforded.
</p>
<p>Here, at the depth of two hundred feet, figures
</p>
<p>were seen moving to and fro, while, right opposite,
</p>
<p>under a beetling cliff, that screened them from
</p>
<p>above, were groups clustered around fires, kindled
</p>

<p>Though shallow, by reason of its rapidity it seemed

<p>Standing on the brow of the cliff, Schwartz now

<p>soon hidden tinder the bank on which the travellers

<p>point at which the path, turning short to the left,

<p>dived into the abyss, leading down a rugged ledge

<p>the very bottom, nearly under the point from which

<p>the shout of Schwartz had given notice of his pre

</p>
<p>ARTHUR TREVOR was the youngest son of a gentle
</p>
<p>man who resided in the neighborhood of Richmond.
</p>
<p>He was a man in affluent circumstances, and had long
</p>
<p>and honorably filled various important and dignified
</p>
<p>stations in the service of his native State. Endowed
</p>
<p>with handsome talents, an amiable disposition, and all
</p>
<p>the accomplishments that can adorn a gentleman, he
</p>
<p>added to these the most exemplary virtues. His
</p>
<p>influence in society had, of course, been great, and
</p>
<p>though now, at the age of seventy, withdrawn from
</p>
<p>public life, his opinions were inquired of, and his coun
</p>
<p>sel sought, by all who had access to him. Through
</p>
<p>life he had been remarkable for firmness, and yet
</p>
<p>more for prudence. The steadiness of his principles
</p>
<p>could never be questioned, but, it was thought, he
</p>
<p>had sometimes deemed it wise to compromise, when
</p>
<p>men of less cautious temper would have found safety

<p>in prudent boldness.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 37
</p>
<p>To this temperament had been attributed his con
</p>
<p>duct in regard to the politics of the last twenty years.
</p>
<p>Bred up in the school of State rights, and thoroughly
</p>
<p>imbued with its doctrines, he had, even before that time,
</p>
<p>been accustomed to look, with a jealous eye, on the pro
</p>
<p>gressive usurpations of the Federal Government. In the
</p>
<p>hope of arresting these, he had exerted more than his
</p>
<p>usual activity in aiding to put down the younger Adams,
</p>
<p>and to elevate his successor. Though no candidate for
</p>
<p>the si^oils of victory, no man rejoiced more sincerely in
</p>
<p>the result of that contest ; and, until the emanation of the
</p>
<p>proclamation of December, 1832, he had given his hearty
</p>
<p>approbation, and steady, though quiet support, to the
</p>
<p>administration of Andrew Jackson.
</p>
<p>From that moment he seemed to look with fearful
</p>
<p>bodings on the affairs of his country. His disap
</p>
<p>probation of that instrument was expressed with as
</p>
<p>much freedom and force as was consistent with his
</p>
<p>habitual reserve and moderation. He was, indeed,
</p>
<p>alarmed into a degree of excitement unusual with
</p>
<p>him, and might have gone farther than he did, had
</p>
<p>he not found that others were disposed to go, as he
</p>
<p>thought, too far. He had entirely disapproved the
</p>
<p>nullifying ordinance of South Carolina ; and, though
</p>
<p>he recognized the right of secession, he deprecated
</p>
<p>all thought of resorting to that remedy. He was
</p>
<p>aware that many of his best friends, thinking that
</p>
<p>its necessity would be eventually felt by all, feared
</p>
<p>that that conviction might come too late. They

<p>remarked the steady tendency of Federal measures tc
</p>
<p>38 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>weaken the malcontent States in the South, and to
</p>
<p>increase the resources of their northern oppressors
</p>
<p>and those of the General Government. Hence they
</p>
<p>feared, that whenever Virginia, or any other of the
</p>
<p>slave-holding States, should find itself driven to seces
</p>
<p>sion, the other party, in the confidence of superior
</p>
<p>strength, might be tempted forcibly to resist the exer
</p>
<p>cise of the right. They thus arrived at the conclu
</p>
<p>sion that separation (which they deemed inevitable)
</p>
<p>to be peaceable, must be prompt.
</p>
<p>These ideas had been laid before Mr. Trevor, and,
</p>
<p>in proportion to the urgency with which they were
</p>
<p>pressed, was his alarm and his disposition to adhere
</p>
<p>to the Union. He, at last, had brought himself to
</p>
<p>believe union, on any terms, better than disunion,
</p>
<p>under any circumstances. As the lesser evil, there
</p>
<p>fore, he determined to forget the proclamation, arid,
</p>
<p>striving to reconcile himself to all the acts of the
</p>
<p>administration, he regarded every attempt to unite the
</p>
<p>South, in support of a southern president, as a pre
</p>
<p>lude to the formation of a southern confederacy. By
</p>
<p>consequence, he became a partisan of Martin Van
</p>
<p>Buren ; and united with Eitchie, and others of the
</p>
<p>same kidney, in endeavoring to subdue the spirit, and
</p>
<p>tame down the State pride of Virginia. These endea
</p>
<p>vors, aided by the lavish use of federal patronage in
</p>
<p>the State, were so far successful, that when, at the
</p>
<p>end of Van Buren s second term, he demanded a
</p>
<p>third election, she alone, in the South, supported his

</p>
<p>By the steady employment of the same pernicious
</p>
<p>influences, the elections throughout the State had been
</p>
<p>so regulated, as to produce returns of a majority
</p>
<p>of members devoted to the views of the usurper.
</p>
<p>This had continued until the spring of 1848, at which
</p>
<p>time the results of the elections were essentially the
</p>
<p>same which had taken place since the memorable
</p>
<p>1836 ; when Virginia, at one stroke of the pen,
</p>
<p>expunged her name from the chronicles of honor,
</p>
<p>expunged the history of all her glories, expunged her
</p>
<p>self. From that time the land of Washington, and
</p>
<p>Henry, and Mason, of Jefferson, Madison, and Kan-
</p>
<p>dolph, sunk to the rank of a province, administered
</p>
<p>and managed by the Eiveses and Eitchies, the Bar
</p>
<p>bours and Stevensons, the Watkinses and Wilsons,
</p>
<p>whose chance to be remembered in history depends,
</p>
<p>like that of Erostratus, on the glories of that temple

<p>of liberty which they first desecrated and then de-
</p>
<p>etroyed.
</p>
<p>&quot; Where once the Csesars dwelt,
</p>
<p>There dwelt, tuneless, the birds of night.&quot;
</p>
<p>From some cause, not understood at the time, an
</p>
<p>unexpected reaction had taken place between the
</p>
<p>spring elections and the recurrence of that form of
</p>
<p>presidential election in the fall, the observance of
</p>
<p>which was still deemed necessary to display, and, by
</p>
<p>displaying, to perpetuate the usurper s power. This

</p>
<p>It would have seemed as if the spirit of John Ran
</p>
<p>dolph had risen from the sleep of death, and walked
</p>
<p>abroad through the scenes where his youthful shoul
</p>
<p>ders had received the mantle of his eloquence from
</p>
<p>the hand of Henry. For the first time, in twelve
</p>
<p>years, the vote of Virginia was recorded against the
</p>
<p>re-election of Martin Yan Buren to the presidential
</p>
<p>throne.
</p>
<p>But not the less subservient were the proceedings
</p>
<p>of the Legislature elected for his use, the spring be
</p>
<p>fore. Yet enough had been done to justify the hope
</p>
<p>that the ancient spirit of old Virginia would yet
</p>
<p>show itself in the descendants of the men who had
</p>
<p>defied Cromwell, in the plenitude of his power, and
</p>
<p>had cast off the yoke of George the Third, without
</p>
<p>waiting for the co-operation of the other colonies.
</p>
<p>At the same time, the power and the will of a fixed
</p>
<p>majority in the North, to give a master to the South,
</p>
<p>had been made manifest. It was clearly seen, too,
</p>
<p>that he had determined to use the power thus ob
</p>
<p>tained, and to administer the government solely
</p>
<p>with a view to the interest of that sectional faction,
</p>
<p>by which he had been supported. &quot; Vce metis /&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Woe to the vanquished !&quot; was the word. It had
</p>
<p>gone forth ; and northern cupidity and northern
</p>
<p>fanaticism were seen to march, hand in hand, to the
</p>
<p>plunder and desolation of the South.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Southern States
</p>
<p>had been, at length, forced to see that the day for

<p>mined no longer to abide the obligations of a con
</p>
<p>stitution, the form of which alone remained, and
</p>
<p>having, by a movement nearly simultaneous, seceded
</p>
<p>from the Union, they had immediately formed a&quot;
</p>
<p>Southern Confederacy. The suddenness of these
</p>
<p>measures was less remarkable than the prudence with
</p>
<p>which they had ~been conducted. The two together
</p>
<p>left little doubt that there had been a preconcert
</p>
<p>among the leading men of the several States, arrang
</p>
<p>ing provisionally what should le done, whenever cir
</p>
<p>cumstances should throw power into the hands of those
</p>
<p>whom, at the bidding of the usurper, the people had
</p>
<p>once driven from their councils. It is now known
</p>
<p>that there was such concert. Nor was it confined to
</p>
<p>the seceding States alone. In Virginia, also, there
</p>
<p>were men who entered into the same views. But
</p>
<p>while the President believed that no decisive step
</p>
<p>would be taken by the more Southern States with
</p>
<p>out her co-operation, he had devoted all his power,
</p>
<p>direct and indirect, to control and influence her elec
</p>
<p>tions. Of tumultuary insurrection he had no fear.
</p>
<p>The organized operation of the State Government
</p>
<p>was what he dreaded. By this alone could the mea
</p>
<p>sure of secession be effected ; and this was effectu
</p>
<p>ally prevented by operating on the elections of
</p>
<p>members of the Legislature of Yirginia. From the
</p>
<p>^November vote on the Presidential election, less
</p>
<p>evil had been apprehended, and less pains had been
</p>
<p>taken to control it. In consequence of this, some

<p>thing more of the real sentiments of the people had
</p>
<p>42 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>been allowed to appear on that occasion ; and, from
</p>
<p>this manifestation, the more Southern States were
</p>
<p>encouraged to hope for the ultimate accession of
</p>
<p>Virginia to their Confederacy. They had therefore
</p>
<p>determined to wait for her no longer , but to proceed
</p>
<p>to the execution of their plan, leaving her to follow.
</p>
<p>The disposition of the usurper, at first, was to treat
</p>
<p>them as revolted provinces ; and to take measures
</p>
<p>for putting down, by force, their resistance to his
</p>
<p>authority. But circumstances, to be mentioned
</p>
<p>hereafter, made it impolitic to resort to this measure.
</p>
<p>But these did not operate to prevent him from using
</p>
<p>the most efficacious means to prevent Virginia from
</p>
<p>following their example. Though restrained from
</p>
<p>attacking them, nothing prevented him from aifect-
</p>
<p>ing to fear an attack from them. This gave a pre
</p>
<p>text for raising troops ; and the position of Virginia,
</p>
<p>as the frontier State, afforded an excuse for station
</p>
<p>ing them within her borders. Under these pretences,
</p>
<p>small corps were established in many of the disaf
</p>
<p>fected counties. Should the presence of these be
</p>
<p>ineffectual to secure the return of delegates devoted
</p>
<p>to the crown, an ultimate security was taken against
</p>
<p>the action of the Legislature. Richmond, the seat
</p>
<p>of government, became the head-quarters of the army
</p>
<p>of observation, as it was called, and, surrounded by
</p>
<p>this, the mock deliberations of the General Assembly

<p>were to be held.

<p>HAMLET.
</p>
<p>AMONG those who had been most prompt to take
</p>
<p>this view of the subject, and most vehement in re
</p>
<p>commending it, was a younger brother of Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>In all, but the great essentials of moral worth, this
</p>
<p>gentleman was the very reverse of his brother. The
</p>
<p>difference was, perhaps, mainly attributable to the
</p>
<p>character of his intellect. Quick in conception, and
</p>
<p>clear in his views, he was strong in his convictions,
</p>
<p>and habitually satisfied with his conclusions. This,
</p>
<p>added to a hasty temper, gave him the appearance
</p>
<p>and character of a man rash, inconsiderate, and pre
</p>
<p>cipitate, always in advance of the progress of public
</p>
<p>opinion, and too impatient to wait for it. His ill
</p>
<p>success in life seemed to justify this construction.
</p>
<p>Though eminently gifted by nature, and possessing
</p>
<p>all the advantages of education, he had never occu
</p>
<p>pied any of those stations in which distinction is to
</p>
<p>be gained. In his private affairs, he had been alike
</p>
<p>unprosperous. Though his habits were not expen
</p>
<p>sive, his patrimony had been but little increased by

<p>his own exertions. He had married a lady of hand

</p>
<p>two daughters, he had not the means of endowing
</p>
<p>them with more than a decent competency ; while
</p>
<p>his elder brother, with a family of a dozen children,
</p>
<p>had educated the whole, and provided handsomely
</p>
<p>for such as. had set out in life, and retained the where
</p>
<p>withal to give the rest nearly as much as the children
</p>
<p>of the younger could expect. In short, the career
</p>
<p>of Mr. Hugh Trevor had been one of uninterrupted
</p>
<p>prosperity. In all his undertakings he had been
</p>
<p>successful. Wealth had flowed into his coffers, and
</p>
<p>honors had been showered on his head. &quot; When the
</p>
<p>eye saw him, then it blessed him.&quot; Men pointed
</p>
<p>him out to their children, and said to them : &quot; Copy
</p>
<p>his example, and follow his steps.&quot;
</p>
<p>The life of Bernard, the younger brother, had been
</p>
<p>passed in comparative obscurity. Beloved by a few,
</p>
<p>but misunderstood by many, his existence was un
</p>
<p>known to the multitude, and unheeded by most who
</p>
<p>were aware of it. They, indeed, who knew him
</p>
<p>well, saw in him qualities which, under discreet re
</p>
<p>gulation, might have won for him distinction and
</p>
<p>affluence. None knew him better, and none saw this
</p>
<p>more clearly, than his elder brother. No man gave
</p>
<p>him more credit for talent and honor, or less for pru
</p>
<p>dence and common sense. A habit of doubting the
</p>
<p>correctness of his opinions, and condemning his
</p>
<p>measures, had thus taken possession of the mind of
</p>
<p>Mr. Hugh Trevor: and, as the quick and intuitive

<p>sion, the knowledge of that created, in the other, a
</p>

</p>
<p>predisposition to arrive at a different result. In pro
</p>
<p>portion as the one was clear, so did the other doubt.
</p>
<p>When the former was ardent, the latter was always
</p>
<p>cold ; and in all matters in which they had a com
</p>
<p>mon interest, the cautions foresight of Hugh never
</p>
<p>failed to see a lion in the path which Bernard wished
</p>
<p>to pursue. They were the opposite poles of the same
</p>
<p>needle. The clear convictions of the latter on the
</p>
<p>subject of secession had shaken the faith of the for
</p>
<p>mer in his own, and had finally driven him to the con
</p>
<p>clusion already intimated, &quot; that union, on any terms,
</p>
<p>was better than disunion, under any circumstances&quot;
</p>
<p>The same habit of thinking had retarded the
</p>
<p>change, which the events of the last three years had
</p>
<p>been working in the mind of Mr. Hugh Trevor. His
</p>
<p>native candor and modesty made it easy for him to
</p>
<p>believe that he had been wrong, and, being convinced
</p>
<p>of error, to admit it. But a corollary from this ad
</p>
<p>mission would be, that the inconsiderate and impru
</p>
<p>dent Bernard had, all the time, been right. Of the
</p>
<p>correctness of such an admission Mr. Trevor felt an
</p>
<p>habitual diffidence, that made him among the last

<p>menced in no mind sooner than in his. But the

<p>change was now complete, and it brought to the

<p>have given a direction to their political course, might
</p>
<p>not have been difficult. But, in the act of repenting
</p>
<p>an acknowledged error, how could he presume so far
</p>
<p>on his new convictions, as to endeavor to bind them
</p>
<p>on the minds of others? Was it even right to use
</p>
<p>any portion of his paternal influence for the purpose
</p>
<p>of giving to the future course of his children s lives
</p>
<p>such a tendency as might lead them into error, to
</p>
<p>the disappointment of their hopes, and perhaps to
</p>
<p>crime? The answer to these questions led to a de
</p>
<p>termination to leave them to their own thoughts,
</p>
<p>guided by such lights as circumstances might throw
</p>
<p>upon these important subjects.
</p>
<p>It happened unfortunately, that, about the time
</p>
<p>of Mr. Yan Buren s accession to the presidency, his
</p>
<p>eldest son had just reached the time of life when it
</p>
<p>is necessary to choose a profession. &quot;Without any
</p>
<p>particular purpose of devoting him to the army, he
</p>
<p>had been educated at West Point. The favor of ,
</p>
<p>President Jackson had offered this advantage, which,
</p>
<p>by the father of so large a family, was not to be
</p>
<p>declined. But the young man acquired a taste for
</p>
<p>military life, and there was no man in Virginia whom
</p>
<p>the new President was more desirous to bind to his
</p>
<p>service than Mr. Hugh Trevor ; his wishes had been
</p>
<p>ascertained, and the ready advancement of his son
</p>
<p>was the consequence. The promotion of Owen Trevor
</p>
<p>had accordingly been hastened by all means consist

</p>
<p>sometimes violated in his favor. In one instance,
</p>
<p>he had been elevated over the head of a senior officer
</p>
<p>of acknowledged merit. The impatience of this gen
</p>
<p>tleman, which had tempted him to offer his resigna
</p>
<p>tion, had been soothed by a staff appointment, accom
</p>
<p>panied by an understanding that he should not,
</p>
<p>unnecessarily, be placed under the immediate com
</p>
<p>mand of young Trevor. The latter, at the date of
</p>
<p>which we speak, had risen to the command of a regi
</p>
<p>ment, which was now encamped in the neighbor
</p>
<p>hood of Washington, in daily expectation of being
</p>
<p>ordered on active duty.
</p>
<p>Colonel Owen Trevor had received his first impres
</p>
<p>sions, on political subjects, at a time when circum
</p>
<p>stances made his father anxious to establish in his
</p>
<p>mir.d a conviction that union was the one thing need
</p>
<p>ful. To the maintenance of this he had taught him
</p>
<p>to dt vote himself, and, overlooldng his allegiance to his
</p>
<p>witivz State, to consider himself as the sworn soldier of
</p>
<p>the Federal Government. It was certainly not the wish
</p>
<p>i&amp;gt;f Mr. Trevor to teach his son to regard Virginia
</p>
<p>merdy as a municipal division of a great consolidated
</p>
<p>empire. But while he taught him to act on precepts
</p>
<p>which seemed drawn from such premises, it was natu
</p>
<p>ral that the young man should adopt them.
</p>
<p>He did adopt them. He had learned to deride the
</p>
<p>idea of State sovereignty ; and his long residence in
</p>
<p>the North had given him a disgust at all that is pecu
</p>
<p>liar in the manners, habits, institutions, and character

<p>of Virginia. Among his boon companions he had
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 49
</p>
<p>been accustomed to express these sentiments ; and,
</p>
<p>being repeated at court, they had made him a favor
</p>
<p>ite there. .He had been treated by the President
</p>
<p>with distinguished attention. He seemed honored,
</p>
<p>too, with the personal friendship of that favorite son,
</p>
<p>whom he had elevated to the chief command of the
</p>
<p>army. Him he had consecrated to the purple ; pro
</p>
<p>posing to cast on him the mantle of his authority, so
</p>
<p>as to unite, in the person of his chosen successor, the
</p>
<p>whole military and civil power of the empire.
</p>
<p>It was impossible that a young man, like Col. Tre
</p>
<p>vor, should fail to feel himself flattered by such notice.
</p>
<p>He had been thought, when a boy, to be warm-hearted
</p>
<p>and generous, and his devotion to his patrons, which
</p>
<p>was unbounded, was placed to the account of grati
</p>
<p>tude by his friends. The President, on his part, was
</p>
<p>anxiously watching for an opportunity to reward
</p>
<p>this personal zeal, which is so strong a recommenda
</p>
<p>tion to the favor of the great. It was intimated to
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor that nothing was wanting to ensure him
</p>
<p>speedy promotion to the rank of brigadier, but some
</p>
<p>act of service which might be magnified, by a pen
</p>
<p>sioned press, into a pretext for advancing him beyond
</p>
<p>his equals in rank. Apprised of this, he burned
</p>
<p>for active employment, and earnestly begged to be
</p>
<p>marched to the theatre of war.
</p>
<p>This theatre was Virginia. But he had long since
</p>
<p>ceased to attribute any political personality to the
</p>
<p>State, and it was a matter of no consequence to him
</p>
<p>that the enemies, against whom he was to act, had

<p>been born or resided there. Personally they were
</p>
<p>strangers to him ; and he only knew them as men
</p>
<p>denying the supremacy of the Federal Government,
</p>
<p>and hostile to the President and his intended succes
</p>
<p>sor (Van Buren).
</p>
<p>One person, indeed, he might possibly meet in arms,
</p>
<p>whom he would gladly avoid. His younger brother,
</p>
<p>Douglas Trevor, had been, like himself, educated at
</p>
<p>West Point, had entered the army, and served some
</p>
<p>years. Having spent a winter at home, it was suspected
</p>
<p>that he had become infected with the treasonable heresies
</p>
<p>of southern politicians. He had resigned his commission
</p>
<p>and travelled into South Carolina. TJie effect of this
</p>
<p>journey on his opinions was not a matter of doubt. Let
</p>
<p>ters had been received from him, by his brother and several
</p>
<p>young officers of his own regiment, avowing a total change
</p>
<p>of sentiment. These letters left no doubt, that should Vir
</p>
<p>ginia declare for secession, or even in case of collision
</p>
<p>between the Southern League and the old United States,
</p>
<p>he would be found fighting against the latter. The
</p>
<p>avowal of such sentiments and purposes had so excited
</p>
<p>the displeasure of the Colonel, that he had cut short
</p>
<p>the correspondence by begging that he might never
</p>
<p>again be reminded that he was the brother of a trai
</p>
<p>tor. His letter to this effect, being laid before the
</p>
<p>Commander-in-chief, had given the most decisive proof
</p>
<p>of the zeal of one brother and the defection of the
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>How this had been brought about, Colonel Trevor

<p>not been so, at the time when he was awakened to a

<p>sense of his country s wrongs and his own duty. The

<p>The boy is grown

</p>
<p>CEABBE.
</p>
<p>DIFFERENCE of political opinion had produced no
</p>
<p>estrangement between Mr. Hugh Trevor and his bro
</p>
<p>ther, though it had interrupted their intercourse by
</p>
<p>rendering it less agreeable. Men cannot take much
</p>
<p>pleasure in each other s society, when the subject on
</p>
<p>which both think and feel most deeply, is one on
</p>
<p>which they widely differ. The} 7 accordingly saw little
</p>
<p>of each other, though an occasional letter passed
</p>
<p>between them in token of unabated affection.
</p>
<p>I believe I have mentioned that the children of Mr.
</p>
<p>Bernard Trevor were both daughters. The eldest,
</p>
<p>then seventeen years of age. had been invited to
</p>
<p>spend, with her uncle, in the vicinity of Richmond,
</p>
<p>the winter of Douglas s furlough. He was at that
</p>
<p>time about five-and-twenty. His long residence in
</p>
<p>the North had not weaned him from his native State.
</p>
<p>He had not been flattered into a contempt of every
</p>
<p>thing Virginian. Neither his age nor rank gave him
</p>
<p>consequence enough to be the object of that sort of

</p>
<p>attention. Perhaps, too, it had been seen that he was
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 53
</p>
<p>a less fit subject for it than his elder brother. Though
</p>
<p>much the younger, he had a range, originality, and
</p>
<p>independence of thought, of which the other was
</p>
<p>incapable. Eesting in the esteem of his friends and
</p>
<p>the approbation of his own conscience, the applause
</p>
<p>of the multitude, the flattery of sycophants, and the
</p>
<p>seducing attentions of superiors, had small charms for
</p>
<p>him. His heart had never ceased to glow at the name
</p>
<p>of Virginia, and he returned to her as the wanderer
</p>
<p>should return to the bosom of his home to his
</p>
<p>friends to his native land. In appearance, manners,
</p>
<p>and intelligence, he was much improved ; in feeling,
</p>
<p>the same warm-hearted, generous, unsophisticated
</p>
<p>youth, as formerly.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, his cousin Delia had already
</p>
<p>reached his father s house, and was domesticated in
</p>
<p>the family. There she found the younger brothers
</p>
<p>and sisters of Douglas impatiently expecting his
</p>
<p>arrival ; and so much occupied with the thought of
</p>
<p>him, that, had she been of a jealous disposition, she
</p>
<p>might have deemed her welcome somewhat careless.
</p>
<p>But she already knew her cousins, her uncle, and her
</p>
<p>aunt. This was not the first time that their house was
</p>
<p>her temporary home ; and she had learned to consider
</p>
<p>herself as one of the family. As such, she was ex
</p>
<p>pected to enter into all their feelings. Douglas was
</p>
<p>their common favorite. During his long absence, his
</p>
<p>heart had never cooled toward them. In this he dif
</p>
<p>fered widely from Owen, in whom the pleasures of

</p>
<p>an idle life and the schemes of ambition had left little
</p>
<p>54 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>thought of the simple joys of his childhood s home,
</p>
<p>The contrast between him and Douglas, in this
</p>
<p>respect, rendered the latter yet more popular with the
</p>
<p>single-hearted beings who were impatiently waiting
</p>
<p>his return.
</p>
<p>&quot; Do you remember brother Douglas ?&quot; said Vir
</p>
<p>ginia Trevor (a girl one year younger than Delia).
</p>
<p>&quot; Mamma says you were a great pet with him, when
</p>
<p>a child, and used to call him your Douglas.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I could not have been more than three years old
</p>
<p>at the time you speak of,&quot; said Delia ; &quot; but I have
</p>
<p>heard of it so often, that I seem to myself to remem
</p>
<p>ber him. But, of course, I do not remember him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And, of course, he does not remember you,&quot;
</p>
<p>said Mrs. Trevor. &quot; At least he would not know
</p>
<p>you. But I doubt if he ever has forgotten you, as
</p>
<p>you were then. He was to be your husband, you
</p>
<p>know ; and your father gave him a set of rules to
</p>
<p>walk by. He was to do so and so, and to be so and
</p>
<p>so ; and Harry Sanford was to be his model. He said
</p>
<p>nothing about it ; but * Sanford and Merton was
</p>
<p>hardly ever out of his hands, and we could see that
</p>
<p>he was always trying to square his conduct by your
</p>
<p>father s maxims. I believe in my heart it made a
</p>
<p>difference in the boy ; and that is the reason why lie
</p>
<p>is less like his own father, and more like yours, than
</p>
<p>any of the rest of my boys.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I shall certainly love him, then,&quot; said Delia, her
</p>
<p>eyes filling as she spoke, &quot; if he is like my dear old

</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>&quot; Indeed, and you may,&quot; said Mrs. Trevor; &quot;but,
</p>
<p>for all that, I would rather have him like his own
</p>
<p>father. But you must not be affronted, Delia ; you
</p>
<p>know I claim the right to brag about my old man,
</p>
<p>and to set him up over everybody even the Presi
</p>
<p>dent himself.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; / never saw the President&quot; said Delia, &quot;but 1
</p>
<p>should be sorry to compare my father with him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I can assure you,&quot; replied the aunt, &quot;there are
</p>
<p>very few men that would bear the comparison. Oh !
</p>
<p>he is the most elegant, agreeable old gentleman, that
</p>
<p>ever I saw.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Except my uncle,&quot; said Delia, smiling.
</p>
<p>&quot; Pshaw ! Yes, to be sure. I always except
</p>
<p>him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; /will not except my father&quot; said Delia, gravely.
</p>
<p>&quot; I should not like to hear him and Martin Yan
</p>
<p>Buren praised in the same breath.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well, my dear,&quot; said the good-humored old
</p>
<p>lady, &quot; we must not quarrel about it. But you must
</p>
<p>take care not to talk so before Douglas, because he is

<p>the President s soldier&quot;

<p>&quot; Well ! and is not that all the same thing? / do
</p>
<p>not pretend to know anything about it, but my hus

<p>band says so, and that is enough for me.&quot;
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor, who had sat by the while, listening
</p>
<p>with grave complacency, now said : &quot; I am afraid you

</p>
<p>don t report me truly, my dear.&quot; Then, extending
</p>
<p>3&quot;6 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>his hand to Delia, he drew her gently to him, and
</p>
<p>placing her on his knee, kissed her. &quot; You are a
</p>
<p>good girl,&quot; said he, &quot; and shall love and honor your
</p>
<p>father as much as you please. He is a noble, gene
</p>
<p>rous man, and a wise man too. I would to God, 1
</p>
<p>added he, sighing heavily, &quot; that I had had half his
</p>
<p>wisdom.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, bless my soul, Mr. Trevor 1&quot; exclaimed his
</p>
<p>wife, &quot; what does this mean ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied he, &quot;but a just compliment to
</p>
<p>the self-renouncing generosity and far-sighted sagacity
</p>
<p>of my brother.&quot;
</p>
<p>Saying this, he rose and left the room, while his
</p>
<p>wife gazed after him in amazement. She had never
</p>
<p>heard him say so much before, and now perceived
</p>
<p>that he had thoughts that she was not apprised of.
</p>
<p>Believing him faultless and incapable of error, even
</p>
<p>when he differed from himself, she at once concluded
</p>
<p>that she had lost her cue, and determined to say no
</p>
<p>more about politics until she recovered it. But he
</p>
<p>never adverted to the subject again, in her presence,
</p>
<p>during the whole winter ; and her niece, consequently,
</p>
<p>heard no farther allusion to it from her.
</p>
<p>This was no unwelcome relief to Delia. She was
</p>
<p>no politician ; but she was not incapable of under
</p>
<p>standing what passed in her presence on the subject,
</p>
<p>except when the interlocutors chose to mystify their
</p>
<p>meaning. Her father, a man of no reserves, never

<p>spoke but with a purpose of expressing his thoughts

<p>clearly and fully ; and 110 man better knew how to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 57
</p>
<p>express them than he. Though deficient, as I have
</p>
<p>said, in that cold prudence which takes advantage of
</p>
<p>circumstances, he was eminently gifted with that more
</p>
<p>vigorous faculty which makes thcn. In the piping
</p>
<p>times of peace, he was a man of no mark. But when
</p>
<p>society was breaking up from its foundations, he was
</p>
<p>the man with whom the timid and doubting would
</p>
<p>seek safety and counsel. Infirmity had now overtaken
</p>
<p>him, and he could do little more than think and speak.
</p>
<p>Consulted by all the. bold spirits who sought to lift
</p>
<p>up, from the dust, the soiled and tattered banner of
</p>
<p>his native State, and spread it to the wind, he never
</p>
<p>failed to converse freely with such, and often in the
</p>
<p>presence of his daughters.
</p>
<p>By this means, if he had not imbued them with his
</p>
<p>opinions, or charged their minds with the arguments
</p>
<p>by which he was accustomed to support them, he had
</p>
<p>made them full partakers of his feelings. It seemed,
</p>
<p>indeed, as if he had a purpose in this. What that
</p>
<p>purpose was, time would show. One end, at least,
</p>
<p>it answered. It increased their opinion of his powers,
</p>
<p>their confidence in his wisdom, and their love for his
</p>
<p>person. Mrs. Hugh Trevor herself did not hold her
</p>
<p>husband s wisdom in more reverence than was
</p>
<p>cherished by Delia for that of her father.
</p>
<p>And never did man better deserve the confiding
</p>
<p>affection of a daughter. He had been her principal
</p>
<p>instructor from infancy. He had formed her mind ;
</p>
<p>he had trained her to self-command, and taught her
</p>
<p>to find her happiness in virtue. Educated at home,

</p>
<p>her manners were formed in a domestic circle cha
</p>
<p>racterized by refinement, and delicate, but frank pro
</p>
<p>priety. Her love of reading had been cultivated by
</p>
<p>throwing books in her way; and, the taste once
</p>
<p>formed, her attention had been directed to such as
</p>
<p>might best qualify her for the duties of woman s only
</p>
<p>appropriate station. Herein she had an example in
</p>
<p>her mother ; a lady of the old school, courteous and
</p>
<p>gentle, but high-spirited, generous, and full of her
</p>
<p>husband s enthusiasm in the cause of his country.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Trevor was, indeed, a man to be loved
</p>
<p>passionately, if loved at all ; and to shed the vivid
</p>
<p>hue of his mind on those of his associates. It was
</p>
<p>the delight of his wife to witness, and to cherish, the
</p>
<p>dutiful affection and ardent admiration of her daugh
</p>
<p>ters for their father. The consequence was, that his
</p>
<p>power over their thoughts, feelings, and inclinations
</p>
<p>was unbounded.
</p>
<p>It will be readily believed, that, in the mind of
</p>
<p>Delia Trevor, thus pre-occupied, there was no room
</p>
<p>for any very favorable predispositions toward a young
</p>
<p>man, trained from his boyhood in the service of her
</p>
<p>country s oppressors. She had heard his mother
</p>
<p>speak of him as the sworn soldier of the arch-enemy
</p>
<p>of her beloved Virginia ; and a sentiment of abhor
</p>
<p>rence arose in her mind at the words. But she re
</p>
<p>flected that he was her cousin ; the son of her good
</p>
<p>uncle ; the brother of her dearest friend; and, trying
</p>

</p>
<p>wicked. But, after all this discipline of her own
</p>
<p>mind, she found it impossible to think of him with
</p>
<p>complacency, or to anticipate his arrival with plea
</p>
<p>sure. Her imagination always painted him in the hate
</p>
<p>ful dress, which she had been taught to regard as the
</p>
<p>badge of slavery the livery of a tyrant. She would try
</p>
<p>to love him, as a kinsman, but she never could like him
</p>
<p>or respect him.
</p>
<p>At length he made his appearance, and, to her great
</p>
<p>relief, in the plain attire of a citizen. He was a
</p>
<p>handsome youth, whose native grace had been im
</p>
<p>proved by his military education, and in his manners
</p>
<p>uniting the frankness of a boy with the polish and
</p>
<p>elegance of an accomplished gentleman. Whether
</p>
<p>he had been admonished by his father to respect the
</p>
<p>feelings of his fair cousin, or bad caught his reserve,
</p>
<p>on the subject of politics, by contagion, she had no
</p>
<p>means of knowing. Certain it is, that, on that sub
</p>
<p>ject, he was uniformly silent, and Delia soon learned
</p>
<p>to converse with him on other topics, without dread
</p>
<p>ing an allusion to that. She thus saw him as he was,
</p>
<p>and, by degrees, lost the prejudice which, for a time,
</p>
<p>blinded her to any merit he might possess.
</p>
<p>And he did possess great merit. A high sense of
</p>
<p>honor, strict principles, great openness, and generosity,
</p>
<p>were united in him with talents of no common order.
</p>
<p>Quick, apprehensive, and clear in his perceptions, there
</p>
<p>was a boldness, vividness, and distinctness in his
</p>
<p>thoughts and language, that continually reminded her

</p>
<p>he frequently spoke with great veneration and affec
</p>
<p>tion. He remembered, as his mother had conjectured,
</p>
<p>many of his uncle s precepts. He frequently quoted
</p>
<p>them as of high authority with him ; and it was plain
</p>
<p>to see, that, cherished during fourteen years, they had
</p>
<p>exercised a decided influence in the formation of his
</p>
<p>character. Indeed, it might be doubted whether his
</p>
<p>imagination had ever dismissed the idea, which had
</p>
<p>first disposed him to lend a willing ear to the sugges
</p>
<p>tions of his uncle. That which was sport to the elder
</p>
<p>members of the family, had seemed to him, at the
</p>
<p>time, a serious business. The thought that the little
</p>
<p>girl, who loved to hang on his neck and kiss him,
</p>
<p>might one day be his wife, had certainly taken posses
</p>
<p>sion of his boyish mind. How long he had con
</p>
<p>sciously retained it could not be known ; but the
</p>
<p>traces of it were still there, and were certainly not
</p>
<p>obliterated by the change which time had wrought in
</p>
<p>his cousin.
</p>
<p>Of her personal appearance I have said nothing.
</p>
<p>Were I writing a novel, I should be bound, by all
</p>
<p>precedent, to give an exact account of Delia s whole
</p>
<p>exterior. Her person, her countenance, her hair, her
</p>
<p>eyes, her complexion, should all be described, and
</p>
<p>the whole summed up in a tout ensemble of surpassing
</p>
<p>beauty. But, in this true history, I am unfortunately
</p>
<p>bound down by facts, and I lament, that to the best
</p>
<p>of my recollection, I shall not have occasion to speak
</p>
<p>of a single female, in the progress of my narrative,

</p>
<p>whose beauty can be made a theme of just praise. I
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 61
</p>
<p>do sincerely lament this ; for such is the constitution
</p>
<p>of human nature, that female beauty influences the
</p>
<p>heart and mind of man, even by report. We read, in
</p>
<p>Oriental tales, of great princes deeply enamored of
</p>
<p>descriptions. The grey eyes of Queen Elizabeth have
</p>
<p>always made her unpopular with the youthful reader ;
</p>
<p>and the beauty of Mary of Scotland, three hundred
</p>
<p>years after the worms have eaten her, still continues
</p>
<p>to gild her history and gloss over her crimes. I can
</p>
<p>say nothing so much in favor of the beauty of Delia
</p>
<p>Trevor, as that she was good and intelligent, remind
</p>
<p>ing the reader of the sage adage of Mrs. Dorothy
</p>
<p>Primrose, to wit : &quot; Handsome is, that handsome
</p>
<p>does.&quot; I can only add, that, when I saw her after
</p>
<p>wards hanging on the arm of Douglas, and looking
</p>
<p>up in his face with all the deep and heartfelt devotion
</p>
<p>of a woman s love, I saw enough of the constituents
</p>
<p>of beauty to make her an object of love, and enough
</p>
<p>of the soul of truth and tenderness to make her seem
</p>
<p>transcendently beautiful in the eyes of a lover.
</p>
<p>I say this, to account for the fact that her cousin
</p>
<p>Douglas soon found himself taking great pleasure in
</p>
<p>her society, and anxious to please her, not more from
</p>
<p>duty than inclination. He was, perhaps, chiefly at
</p>
<p>tracted by her conversation, which was always cheer
</p>
<p>ful, sprightly, and intelligent. He may have yielded
</p>
<p>to a spell of hardly less magic than that of beauty ;
</p>
<p>the spell of a voice melodious, distinct, articulate,
</p>
<p>and richly flexible, varying its tones unconsciously

<p>It may have been the effect of what Byron would

<p>&quot;propinquity;&quot; or it may have been that his hour

</p>
<p>DOUGLAS TREVOK reached his father s house just
</p>
<p>after the Virginia Legislature had assembled. The
</p>
<p>presidential election was just over, and the partisans
</p>
<p>of Van Buren, exulting in their success, made their
</p>
<p>leader the more hateful to his opponents by the inso
</p>
<p>lence of their triumph. Though he had lost the
</p>
<p>vote of Virginia, it will be remembered that he still
</p>
<p>commanded a majority in the Legislature, elected
</p>
<p>before the revolution in public sentiment was com
</p>
<p>plete. The more recent expression of public senti
</p>
<p>ment showed that the time was come when power
</p>
<p>must be held by means far different from those by
</p>
<p>which it had been acquired. Opinion, which at
</p>
<p>first had been in their favor, was now against them.
</p>
<p>Corruption had for a time supplied the place ; but
</p>
<p>the fund of corruption was all insufficient to buy off
</p>
<p>the important interests which were now roused to
</p>
<p>defend themselves. To add to its efficiency by all
</p>
<p>practicable means, and to bring to its aid the arm
</p>
<p>of force, was all that remained.

<p>64 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>operations, were the great objects which engaged
</p>
<p>the minds of the majority in the Virginia Legisla
</p>
<p>ture. But these, important as they were, could not
</p>
<p>entirely wean them from those indulgences which,
</p>
<p>for many years, had made Richmond, during the
</p>
<p>winter season, the scene of so much revel and
</p>
<p>debauchery. To these, as well as to personal intri
</p>
<p>gues and the great interests of the faction, much
</p>
<p>time was given. But the necessity of attending
</p>
<p>especially to the latter was made daily more apparent
</p>
<p>by the startling intelligence which every mail brought
</p>
<p>from the South and Southwest. The nearly simul
</p>
<p>taneous secession of the States in that quarter, and
</p>
<p>the measures to be taken for the formation of a
</p>
<p>southern confederacy, were things which had been
</p>
<p>talked off until they were no longer dreaded. But
</p>
<p>causes had gradually wrought their necessary effects,
</p>
<p>and the ultimate cooperation of Virginia, if left to
</p>
<p>act freely, was now sure.
</p>
<p>I have already spoken of those men, in each of the
</p>
<p>southern States, of cool heads, long views, and stout
</p>
<p>hearts, who, watching the progress of events, had
</p>
<p>clearly seen the point to which they tended. It is
</p>
<p>not here that their names and deeds are to be regis

<p>tered. They are already recorded in history, and
</p>
<p>blazoned on the tomb of that hateful tyranny which
</p>
<p>they overthrew. They had been discarded from the

</p>
<p>and the fierce assaults of rapacity and fanaticism,
</p>
<p>hounded on by ambition to the destruction of the
</p>
<p>South, had restored them [the State-rights men ]
</p>
<p>to public favor. They had seen that secession must
</p>
<p>come, and that, come when it might, their influence
</p>
<p>would be proportioned to their past disgraces. Pre
</p>
<p>suming on this, they had consulted much together.
</p>
<p>Not only had they sketched provisionally the plan
</p>
<p>of a southern confederacy, but they had taken
</p>
<p>measures to regulate their relations with foreign
</p>
<p>powers.&quot; One of their number, travelling abroad,
</p>
<p>had been instructed to prepare the way for the
</p>
<p>negotiation of a commercial treaty with Great
</p>
<p>Britain. One of the first acts of the new confede
</p>
<p>racy was to invest him publicly with the diplomatic
</p>
<p>character, and it was at once understood that com
</p>
<p>mercial arrangements would be made, the value of
</p>
<p>which w^ould secure to the infant League all the
</p>
<p>advantages of an alliance with that powerful nation.
</p>
<p>The designation of a gentleman, as minister, who
</p>
<p>had so long, without any ostensible motive, resided
</p>
<p>near the Court of St. James, left no doubt that all
</p>
<p>things had been already arranged. The treaty soon

<p>after promulgated, therefore, surprised nobody, ex

<p>cept indeed that some of its details were too obvi

<p>ously beneficial to both parties to have been expect

<p>66 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>South the full benefit of its natural advantages, and
</p>
<p>made it once more the most flourishing and pros
</p>
<p>perous country on earth ; which has multiplied the
</p>
<p>manufactories of Great Britain, and increased her
</p>
<p>revenue by an increase of consumption and re
</p>
<p>sources, even while some branches of revenue were
</p>
<p>cut off; and which, at the same time, has broken
</p>
<p>the power of her envious rival in the North, and put
</p>
<p>an end for ever to that artificial prosperity engen
</p>
<p>dered by the oppression and plunder of the southern
</p>
<p>States ; is such an anomaly in modern diplomacy,
</p>
<p>that the rulers at Richmond, or even at Washington,
</p>
<p>might well have been surprised at it. But the bare
</p>
<p>nomination of the plenipotentiary was enough to
</p>
<p>leave no doubt that a treaty was ready for promul
</p>
<p>gation, and that its terms must be such as to secure
</p>
<p>the co-operation of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>But, while the leaders of the ruling faction thought
</p>
<p>of these things, and anxiously consulted for the pre
</p>
<p>servation of their power, there was still found among
</p>
<p>the members of the Legislature the ordinary propor
</p>
<p>tion of men who think of nothing but the enjoyment
</p>
<p>of the present moment. Such men are often like
</p>
<p>sailors in a storm, who, becoming desperate, break

<p>into the spirit room, and drink the more eagerly

<p>because they drink for the last time. When the

</p>
<p>The amusements, therefore, of the legislators
</p>
<p>assembled at Richmond suifered little interruption,
</p>
<p>and the dinner and the galas, the ball and the thea
</p>
<p>tre, and the gaming-table, with revel, dissipation,
</p>
<p>and extravagance, consumed the time of the servants
</p>
<p>of the country, and swallowed up the wasted plunder
</p>
<p>of the treasury.
</p>
<p>Respected by all, beloved by individuals of both
</p>
<p>parties, and courted by that to which he was sup
</p>
<p>posed to belong, Mr. Hugh Trevor was an object of
</p>
<p>the most flattering attention. His house was the
</p>
<p>favorite resort of such as enjoyed the envied privi
</p>
<p>lege of the entree. His gallant and accomplished
</p>
<p>son was the glass before which aspirants for court
</p>
<p>favor dressed themselves. The budding youth of his
</p>
<p>daughter had, for years, been watched with impa
</p>
<p>tient anticipation of the time when her hand might
</p>
<p>be seized as the passport to present wealth and
</p>
<p>future honor.
</p>
<p>Her cousin Delia was not recommended to notice
</p>
<p>by all these considerations ; but the most prevailing
</p>
<p>of the whole was one that made her claims to atten
</p>
<p>tion fully equal to those of Virginia. Her father,
</p>
<p>though in comparatively humble circumstances,
</p>
<p>could give with his daughter a handsomer dowry
</p>
<p>than the elder and wealthier brother could afford
</p>
<p>\vith his. He was notorious for generosity, and his
</p>
<p>infirmities made it probable that he was not long
</p>
<p>for this world. Delia was therefore universally

</p>
<p>regarded as an heiress. Add to this, that in the
</p>
<p>68 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>affection of her uncle she seemed hardly to he post
</p>
<p>poned to his own daughter, and it was ohvions to
</p>
<p>anticipate that the same influence which had pro
</p>
<p>cured office and emolument for himself and his
</p>
<p>sons, would be readily exerted in favor of her future
</p>
<p>husband.
</p>
<p>It followed, that, whatever were the amusements
</p>
<p>of the day, whether ball or theatre, or party of
</p>
<p>pleasure by land or by water, the presence of Delia
</p>
<p>and Virginia was eagerly sought. The latter, simple
</p>
<p>and artless, saw in all who approached her the
</p>
<p>friends of her father. If she thought at all of
</p>
<p>political differences, it was only to recognize in most
</p>
<p>of them the adherents of the man to whose fortunes
</p>
<p>he had so long attached himself, and in whose
</p>
<p>fortunes he had flourished. To all, her welcome
</p>
<p>was alike cordial and her smile always bright.
</p>
<p>With Delia, the case was far different. Much
</p>
<p>more conversant than her cousin with the politics of
</p>
<p>the day, she was aware that her father was obnox
</p>
<p>ious to many that she met. On some of those who
</p>
<p>sought her favor, she knew that he looked with
</p>
<p>detestation and scorn. To such she was as cold and
</p>
<p>repulsive as a real lady can ever permit herself to be
</p>
<p>to one who approaches her as a gentleman in genteel
</p>
<p>society. The height of the modern mode would ?
</p>
<p>indeed, have countenanced in such cases that sort of
</p>
<p>negative insolence, the practice of which is regarded
</p>
<p>as the most decisive indication of high breeding.

</p>
<p>But she had been trained in a different school. She
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 69
</p>
<p>had been taught that, in society, self-respect is the
</p>
<p>first duty of woman ; and that the only inviolable
</p>
<p>safeguard for that, is a care never to offend the self-
</p>
<p>respect of others.
</p>
<p>Thus, while a part of those who approached her,
</p>
<p>were made to feel that their attentions were not
</p>
<p>acceptable, she never afforded them occasion to
</p>
<p>complain of any want of courtesy on her part.
</p>
<p>Without being rebuffed, they felt themselves con
</p>
<p>strained to stand aloof. There was nothing of which
</p>
<p>they could complain ; no pretext for resentment
</p>
<p>no opening for sarcasm no material for scandal.
</p>
<p>But in proportion to the impotence of malice, so
</p>
<p>is the malignity of its hoarded venom. All were
</p>
<p>aware of the political opinions and connexions of
</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Trevor ; and it was easy to make
</p>
<p>remarks in the presence of his daughter, not only
</p>
<p>offensive, but painful to her feelings. To this pur
</p>
<p>pose, no allusion to him was necessary. It was
</p>
<p>enough to speak injuriously of those whom she
</p>
<p>knew to be his friends, and whose public characters
</p>
<p>made them legitimate subjects of applause or cen
</p>
<p>sure. By this, and other means of the like character,
</p>
<p>she was always open to annoyance ; and to such
</p>
<p>means the dastard insolence of those whom her
</p>
<p>coldness had repelled, habitually resorted for revenge.
</p>
<p>On such occasions she frequently found that her

<p>cousin Douglas came to her aid. Unrestrained by

<p>AMONG those who had thus manifested a disposi
</p>
<p>tion to win the favor of Delia Trevor, was a young
</p>
<p>man who had, not long since, entered public life
</p>
<p>under the auspices of a father, who, fifteen years
</p>
<p>before, had openly bartered his principles for office.
</p>
<p>Besides some talent, the son possessed the yet higher
</p>
<p>merit, in the eyes of his superiors, of devotion to his
</p>
<p>party and its leader. He never permitted himself
</p>
<p>to be restrained, by any regard to time or place,
</p>
<p>from making his zeal conspicuous. Taught, from
</p>
<p>his infancy, that the true way to recommend his pre
</p>
<p>tensions was to rate them highly himself, he seemed
</p>
<p>determined never to exchange his place in the
</p>
<p>Legislature for any in the gift of the Court, unless
</p>
<p>some distinguished station should be offered to his
</p>
<p>acceptance. For any such, in any department, he
</p>
<p>was understood to be a candidate.
</p>
<p>At first, he supposed that a private intimation to

</p>
<p>this effect, through his father, would be all-sufficient.
</p>
<p>72 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>But he was overlooked, and post after post, that he
</p>
<p>would gladly have accepted, was conferred on
</p>
<p>others. Fearful that he might be deemed deficient
</p>
<p>in zeal, he redoubled his diligence, and with
</p>
<p>increased eagerness sought every opportunity to
</p>
<p>display his talents and his ardor in the service of his
</p>
<p>master. Still he seemed no nearer to his object.
</p>
<p>Whether it was thought that he was most serviceable
</p>
<p>in his actual station, or that the wily President
</p>
<p>deemed it a needless waste of patronage to buy
</p>
<p>what was his by hereditary title and gratuitous
</p>
<p>devotion, it is hard to say. The gentleman some
</p>
<p>times seemed on the point of becoming malcontent ;
</p>
<p>but his father, who had trained him in the school of
</p>
<p>Sir Pertinax McSycophant, convinced him that
</p>
<p>more was to be got by &quot; booing,&quot; and resolute
</p>
<p>subserviency and flattery of the great, than in any
</p>
<p>other way. Under such impressions, he would
</p>
<p>kindle anew the fervor of his zeal and send up his
</p>
<p>incense in clouds. Again disappointed, and sicken
</p>
<p>ing into the moroseness of hope deferred, he would
</p>
<p>become moody and reserved, as if watching for an
</p>
<p>opportunity of profitable defection.
</p>
<p>Such an opportunity, at such a moment, had
</p>
<p>seemed to present itself in his acquaintance with
</p>
<p>Delia Trevor. A connection with her seemed
</p>
<p>exactly suited to his interested and ambidextrous
</p>
<p>policy. A handsome and amiable girl were items
</p>
<p>in the account of secondary consideration. But her

</p>
<p>fortune was not to be overlooked. Then, should his
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 73
</p>
<p>services, at length, seem likely to meet their long
</p>
<p>deserved reward, she could be presented to the
</p>
<p>court as the niece of Mr. Hugh Trevor, the tried and
</p>
<p>cherished friend of the President. Should the cold
</p>
<p>ingratitude of his superiors at length drive him into
</p>
<p>the opposition for advancement, he was sure of being
</p>
<p>well received as the son-in-law of a patriot so
</p>
<p>devoted as Mr. Bernard Trevor. Utrinque paratus,
</p>
<p>could he secure the hand of Delia, he felt sure that
</p>
<p>he must win, let the cards fall as they might.
</p>
<p>Having taken this view of the subject, and
</p>
<p>examined it in all its bearings, he made up to Delia
</p>
<p>with a directness which startled, and a confidence
</p>
<p>that offended her. But the gentleman had little to
</p>
<p>recommend him to the favor of the fair. His person
</p>
<p>was awkward, and disfigured by .a mortal stoop.
</p>
<p>His features, at once diminutive and irregular, were
</p>
<p>either shrouded with an expression of solemn import
</p>
<p>ance, or set off by a smile of yet more offensive self-
</p>
<p>complacency. His manners bore the same general
</p>
<p>character of conceit, alternately pert and grave ; and
</p>
<p>his conversation wavered between resolute, though
</p>
<p>abortive, attempts at wit, and a sort of chopt logic,
</p>
<p>elaborately employed in proving, by incontestable
</p>
<p>arguments, what nobody ever pretended to deny,
</p>
<p>lie had been taught by his learned and astute
</p>
<p>father, to lay his foundations so deep that his
</p>
<p>arguments and the patience of his hearers were apt
</p>
<p>to be exhausted by the time he got back to the
</p>
<p>surface of tilings. Yet he reasoned with great

<p>tionable, the premises from which other men com

</p>
<p>This talent, and this use of it, are more applauded
</p>
<p>by the world than one would think. Men like to be
</p>
<p>confirmed in their opinions ; and, the fewer and
</p>
<p>more simple these may be, the more grateful are
</p>
<p>they for anything that looks like a demonstration of
</p>
<p>their truth. To a man whose knowledge of arithme
</p>
<p>tic only extends to the profound maxim &quot; that two
</p>
<p>and two make four,&quot; how gratifying to find a dis
</p>
<p>tinguished man condescending to prove it by elabo

</p>
<p>But ladies have little taste for these things, and

<p>still less for the harsh dogmatism and fierce denun
</p>
<p>ciations of hostile, but absent politicians, with which
</p>
<p>Mr. P. Baker, the younger, occasionally varied his
</p>
<p>discourse. To Delia, therefore, the gentleman, in
</p>
<p>and of himself, and apart from all extrinsic consi

<p>derations, was absolutely disagreeable. His first
</p>
<p>advances drove her within the safe defences of
</p>
<p>female pride and reserve. But when the manifest
</p>
<p>audacity of his pretensions led her to think of him
</p>
<p>as the supple slave of power, as one who had prosti
</p>
<p>tuted himself to the service of his master, with an
</p>
<p>eagerness which condemned his zeal to be its own

<p>reward, her disgust increased to loathing, and her
</p>
<p>pride was kindled into resentment. Without show
</p>
<p>ing more of these feelings than became her, she

<p>showed enough to make her the object of his iriso-

</p>
<p>lent and malignant hatred. But she was fortified
</p>
<p>by her position in a family which he dared not
</p>
<p>offend, and his paltry malice found vent in such
</p>
<p>allusions to the politics of the day as he knew must
</p>
<p>wound her.
</p>
<p>Things were about coming to this pass, when
</p>
<p>Douglas Trevor arrived. The first time he met Mr.
</p>
<p>Baker in company with his cousin, lie saw a disposi
</p>
<p>tion on his part to pay attentions which were obvi
</p>
<p>ously annoying to her. Both duty and inclination
</p>
<p>impelled him to come to her relief; and, in doing
</p>
<p>this, he awakened the jealousy and incurred the dis
</p>
<p>pleasure of the gentleman. But these were feelings
</p>
<p>he had no mind to display toward one who wore a
</p>
<p>sword, and especially toward the son of a man so
</p>
<p>influential at Washington as Mr. Hugh Trevor. He
</p>
<p>accordingly drew off, in morose discomfiture, and
</p>
<p>Delia, relieved from his offensive attentions, felt that
</p>
<p>she owed her deliverance to her cousin. He was, of
</p>
<p>course, bound to occupy the place at her side from
</p>
<p>which he had driven Baker ; and she was bound to
</p>
<p>requite the service by making the duty he had im
</p>
<p>posed on himself as little irksome as possible. She
</p>
<p>exerted herself to be agreeable, and succeeded so
</p>
<p>well, that Douglas went to bed that night in the
</p>
<p>firm belief that he had never passed a more pleasant
</p>
<p>evening, or seen a girl of more charming manners
</p>
<p>than Delia.
</p>
<p>This circumstance led to a sort of tacit convention,

</p>
<p>which established him in the character of her spe-
</p>
<p>76 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>cial attendant, in all parties where Mr. Baker made
</p>
<p>his appearance. By an easy progress, this engage
</p>
<p>ment was extended to all societies and all places.
</p>
<p>He knows little of human nature who needs to be
</p>
<p>told the natural consequences of these tilings.
</p>
<p>But, leaving the reader to form his own judgment,
</p>
<p>and to anticipate such result as he may, my present
</p>
<p>business is with the repulsed and irritated Baker,
</p>
<p>Though it consoled his pride and self-love to im
</p>
<p>pute his discomfitures, not to any absolute dislike of
</p>
<p>himself, but to a preference for another, there was
</p>
<p>nothing in that preference to soothe his resentment.
</p>
<p>As Douglas had, in the first instance, come some
</p>
<p>what cavalierly between him and the object of his
</p>
<p>wishes, he, perhaps, had reasonable grounds of dis
</p>
<p>pleasure against him. But, as it might be quite
</p>
<p>inconvenient to give vent to his feelings in that
</p>
<p>direction, they were carefully repressed. In such
</p>
<p>assaults on those of the lady, as her cousin might
</p>
<p>not observe, or might think it unwise to notice, did
</p>
<p>his malice indulge itself.
</p>
<p>So matters stood when the astounding intelligence
</p>
<p>reached Richmond, that a diplomatic agent from the
</p>
<p>State of South Carolina had been long, secretly en
</p>
<p>tertained at the Court of St. James, and that he
</p>
<p>was supposed to have negotiated an informal ar

<p>rangement for a commercial treaty between that

<p>government and the confederacy then forming in

</p>
<p>OLD PLAY.
</p>
<p>IT was now the month of February ; and a plea
</p>
<p>sant day had tempted our young people to a jaunt
</p>
<p>of amusement to the head of the falls. Mr. Baker,
</p>
<p>stealing away from his duties as a legislator, was
</p>
<p>one of the party. Repulsed by Delia, he was begin
</p>
<p>ning an attempt on the heart of Virginia, of whose
</p>
<p>loyalty, as the daughter of Mr. Hugh Trevor, he
</p>
<p>could entertain no doubt.
</p>
<p>Here his reception would have been little better
</p>
<p>than with the other, had not Virginia been held in
</p>
<p>check by a respect for the supposed opinions of her
</p>
<p>father. Born at the very moment when the good
</p>
<p>old gentleman was in the act of making up his mind
</p>
<p>to sacrifice the sovereignty of his native State to the
</p>
<p>necessity of preserving the Union, he seemed to
</p>
<p>seize on the opportunity of compensating the impiety
</p>
<p>to which he felt himself driven, by giving to his
</p>
<p>infant daughter the name he had so long cherished
</p>
<p>and honored. It was a moment of one of those re

</p>
<p>lentings of the heart, in which nature asserts her
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 79
</p>
<p>supremacy, and compels its homage to those whom
</p>
<p>we have been accustomed to reverence and obey.
</p>
<p>If even the prodigal or the *raitor be subject to be
</p>
<p>so affected, how much stronger must be such an im
</p>
<p>pulse in the mind of a pure and upright man, impel
</p>
<p>led by a sense of duty to his country to dishonor her
</p>
<p>venerated name. This poor tribute was as the kiss
</p>
<p>of peace with which the executioner implores the
</p>
<p>pardon of some illustrious victim of State policy, who
</p>
<p>is about to bleed under his hand. Had he yielded
</p>
<p>to his feelings, he would have taken up the self-
</p>
<p>iccusing lamentation of the returned prodigal. But
</p>
<p>his sense of duty was deep and abiding, and was
</p>
<p>always most sure to command his exact obedience
</p>
<p>when the duty was most painful. He could not
</p>
<p>doubt the correctness of a conviction, which even
</p>
<p>his cherished devotion to his native State could not
</p>
<p>make him shake off entirely. In such a case, t
</p>
<p>doubt was, with him, to be convinced.
</p>
<p>But the name thus bestowed upon his daughter
</p>
<p>was not without an effect on her mind. She knew
</p>
<p>little of politics, but, from her very infancy, self-love
</p>
<p>had made her jealous of the honor of the State whose
</p>
<p>name she lore. The name itself was a spell of power
</p>
<p>011 the heart of Delia. It had disposed her to love
</p>
<p>her cousin before she knew her. It had drawn them
</p>
<p>together on their first acquaintance, and had often
</p>
<p>been the theme of conversation between them.

</p>
<p>lual power, Delia had unwittingly exercised an
</p>
<p>80 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>influence over the mind of Virginia which inclined
</p>
<p>her to listen favorably to all that could be urged
</p>
<p>against the usurper s claim to a dominion, unchecked
</p>
<p>by the authority of the State.
</p>
<p>For more than a year past, Mr. Trevor had him
</p>
<p>self begun to doubt the wisdom of his former
</p>
<p>opinions. Doubting, he was silent, but he had not
</p>
<p>been unwilling to subject his daughter to the action
</p>
<p>of her cousin s more vigorous mind. For many
</p>
<p>years, he would as soon have exposed his children
</p>
<p>to the contagion of the plague, as permit them to
</p>
<p>visit their uncle. During the last summer he had
</p>
<p>suffered Arthur and Virginia to spent a month with
</p>
<p>him ; and he was not sorry to observe that the
</p>
<p>former came home with deeper thoughts than he
</p>
<p>chose to express. Of their love and admiration of
</p>
<p>their uncle neither made any secret. He was not
</p>
<p>only unlike their father, but so unlike any other
</p>
<p>man, that he had been a curious study to them
</p>
<p>during their whole visit. The originality of his
</p>
<p>thoughts, and the vividness with which he expressed
</p>
<p>them, afforded them constant amusement. He had
</p>
<p>that faculty of making truth look like truth, in the
</p>
<p>exhibition of which the young mind so much
</p>
<p>delights. Then he was so frank, so ardent, and
</p>
<p>withal so kind, that it was impossible to know and
</p>
<p>not to love him.
</p>
<p>After all this, the reader will not be like to par

<p>found, on shifting his battery, that he was not much
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 81
</p>
<p>more in favor with Virginia Trevor than with her
</p>
<p>cousin. The consequence was, that whenever he
</p>
<p>attempted, in company, to attach himself to the im
</p>
<p>mediate party of these young ladies, he was apt to
</p>
<p>find himself a supernumerary. But, as Virginia
</p>
<p>had shown no marked dislike to him, his vanity
</p>
<p>easily adopted the idea that she considered him as
</p>
<p>the property of Delia. He took some pains to
</p>
<p>undeceive her, and would have been mortified at
</p>
<p>her unconcern on the occasion, had he not thought
</p>
<p>some allowance should he made for her indifference
</p>
<p>to a man who did but take her as a pis alter. He
</p>
<p>did not, therefore, at once withdraw himself from
</p>
<p>their coterie, but continued to hang about, and take
</p>
<p>his part in conversation, whenever nothing particu
</p>
<p>larly exclusive in the manner of the interlocutors
</p>
<p>forbade it. He could not come between whispers ;
</p>
<p>but he could answer any observation that met his ear.
</p>
<p>Being, as. I have said, something between a prose^
</p>
<p>and a declairner, he thought himself eloquent, am.
</p>
<p>would seize occasions to hold forth to the general edi

<p>fication, in a style intended to dazzle the bystanders.
</p>
<p>On the day of which we speak, he had been in
</p>
<p>close attendance on Virginia, until, rather by address
</p>
<p>than by direct repulse, she had contrived to shake
</p>
<p>him off. Is so happened, that the rest of the com

<p>pany were all paired off, leaving him in the enviable

<p>condition of a half pair of shears, when relief

</p>
<p>Baker, being disengaged at the moment, was the
</p>
<p>first to receive the intelligence, and he lost no time
</p>
<p>in awakening- the attention of the company by vol
</p>
<p>leys of oaths and imprecations. &quot;While he continued

<p>to exercise himself in calling down the vengeance

<p>of &quot; the Eternal,&quot; according to the most approved

<p>nounced as traitors, the rest listened in amazement,
</p>
<p>disgust, or alarm, to this boisterous effusion of his
</p>
<p>rage. At length, as he stopped to take breath,
</p>
<p>Douglas availed himself of the pause to ask what
</p>
<p>was the matter. The whole story now came out,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Baker, having put his audience in posses
</p>
<p>sion of his text, went on with his discourse. Un
</p>
<p>mindful of the presence of the ladies, he vented his
</p>
<p>wrath in language with which I do not choose to
</p>
<p>stain my paper. Every man who had held a con
</p>
<p>spicuous place among the advocates of State rights
</p>
<p>for the last twenty years, was condemned, ex cathe

</p>
<p>tender mercies of the devil, in whose clutches he
</p>
<p>supposed them to ~be ; while the living were indis
</p>
<p>criminately devoted to the same doom.

<p>to have been negotiated, his wrath burned most

<p>denunciations of that gentleman, he happened to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 83
</p>
<p>recollect having heard Delia speak of him as the
</p>
<p>intimate friend of her father. The thought turned
</p>
<p>his eye upon her. She was already pale and trem
</p>
<p>blirig with emotion, when she caught his insulting
</p>
<p>glance. In an instant the blood gushed to her face,
</p>
<p>and tears to her eyes. He saw it, and went on to
</p>
<p>comprehend in his denunciation all the aiders, abet
</p>
<p>tors, and friends of the traitor, whom in one breath
</p>
<p>he devoted to the gallows.
</p>
<p>This was more than Delia conld bear, and more
</p>
<p>than Douglas was disposed to suffer. He had caught
</p>
<p>the glance which Baker had cast at his cousin ; he
</p>
<p>saw the effect on her feelings ; he witnessed her in
</p>
<p>creasing emotion, and felt it his duty to come to her
</p>
<p>relief. He approached Baker, and passing him, as
</p>
<p>if with no particular design, touched him gently,
</p>
<p>and said in a low voice: &quot;Such language is im
</p>
<p>proper in this company.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How so,&quot; exclaimed Baker, aloud. &quot; I hope there
</p>
<p>is no man here disposed to take the part of a traitor/
</p>
<p>Douglas turned, and, biting his lip, said in a tone
</p>
<p>not loud, but from its distinctness and marked
</p>
<p>emphasis, audible to all present : &quot; I spoke so as to
</p>
<p>be heard by none but you, and invited you by a
</p>
<p>sign to go apart, where I might explain my meaning
</p>
<p>in private. But, as you will have the explanation
</p>
<p>here, I say, that you know there is no man here dis
</p>
<p>posed to take the part of a traitor. If you had
</p>
<p>thought there was, sir, I suspect your denunciations

<p>would have been less violent.&quot;
</p>
<p>84 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t understand you, sir,&quot; said Baker, red
</p>
<p>dening.
</p>
<p>&quot; My meaning is as plain as becomes this pre
</p>
<p>sence,&quot; said Douglas, coldly, and again walking
</p>
<p>away. Baker looked around, and read in every eye
</p>
<p>that he was expected to follow. He did so, and,
</p>
<p>joining Douglas, they both walked on together.
</p>
<p>u I shall be glad to receive a farther explanation,
</p>
<p>sir,&quot; said he in an agitated tone.
</p>
<p>&quot; Speak lower, then,&quot; replied Douglas, calmly,
</p>
<p>slipping his arm within that of Baker; &quot; and use no
</p>
<p>gesture. My meaning is this: That he who is
</p>
<p>regardless of the presence and feelings of a lady, is
</p>
<p>not apt to overlook those of a man. To make my
</p>
<p>meaning yet plainer, sir, your language would have
</p>
<p>been more guarded, had my uncle been represented
</p>
<p>here, not by a daughter, but by a son&quot;
</p>
<p>The quiet tone of Douglas s voice, the equivocal
</p>
<p>meaning of the first words he had uttered, and the
</p>
<p>pacific action intended to deceive those who looked
</p>
<p>on, had calmed for a moment the alarm of Baker,
</p>
<p>lie had recovered himself before he was made to
</p>
<p>perceive what was really meant ; arid ere he had
</p>
<p>time to reflect on his situation, the dangerous temp
</p>
<p>tation of a repartee assailed him. Glancing back at
</p>
<p>the company, he said: &quot; If I may judge by appear
</p>
<p>ances, sir, you have the right as well as the inclina
</p>
<p>tion to assume that character.&quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas had turned his head, instinctively, as

</p>
<p>Baker looked back, and saw that they had rounded
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 85
</p>
<p>a point of rock, and were out of sight. In an in
</p>
<p>stant, he disengaged his arm with a push that nearly
</p>
<p>threw the legislator down the bank, and stepping
</p>
<p>back, glared upon him with an eye that instantly
</p>
<p>brought the other to his senses. &quot;While he stood
</p>
<p>blenching and cowering under this fierce glance,
</p>
<p>Douglas recovered his self-command, and said, with
</p>
<p>stern calmness : &quot; You had nearly made me forget
</p>
<p>myself, sir. But we understand each other now.
</p>
<p>Take a turn along the shore to compose yourself. I
</p>
<p>will wait here for you, and we will return to the
</p>
<p>company together.&quot;
</p>
<p>He seated himself on a rock, and the other obeyed
</p>
<p>mechanically. How he succeeded in recovering
</p>
<p>his composure is another affair. He walked on, and
</p>
<p>on, and fain would he have followed the course of
</p>
<p>the river to the mountain cave from which it issues,
</p>
<p>there to hide himself from the consequences of his
</p>
<p>own folly and impertinence. What would he not
</p>
<p>have given to recall that last speech? Until then,
</p>
<p>he was the party aggrieved. Douglas s offence
</p>
<p>against him had not been so gross as to admit of no
</p>
<p>explanation ; and, to all appearance, an amicable
</p>
<p>one had been given. The truth might not have
</p>
<p>come out until he had had time to escape to his
</p>
<p>constituents; and before the next session the affair
</p>
<p>might have been forgotten. But now, Douglas had
</p>
<p>been insulted, and how he felt and how he would
</p>
<p>resent the insult, was awfully certain.

<p>Baker continued his walk so far, that the girls
</p>
<p>86 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>became uneasy at the absence of the two young
</p>
<p>men. They begged some of the gentlemen to go in
</p>
<p>quest of them, but the request was evaded. At last,
</p>
<p>they arose from their seats on the rocks, and declared
</p>
<p>they would themselves go. They accordingly set
</p>
<p>out followed by the rest, and in a few yards came to
</p>
<p>where Douglas was quietly seated on a flat stone,
</p>
<p>and playing checks with pebbles on the smooth
</p>
<p>sand.
</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Mr. Baker?&quot; exclaimed Virginia,
</p>
<p>eagerly.
</p>
<p>&quot; Yonder he goes,&quot; replied Douglas, calmly. &quot; He
</p>
<p>has a mind for a longer walk than I like ; and I am
</p>
<p>just waiting for him here. But I must not detain
</p>
<p>you, girls. His taste for the picturesque will pro
</p>
<p>bably be satisfied by the time we get to our horses,
</p>
<p>and he will soon overtake us.&quot;
</p>
<p>He said this with an air so careless as to deceive
</p>
<p>every person present but Delia. But the heart will
</p>
<p>speak from the eye, and a glance at her, as she
</p>
<p>searched his countenance, unconsciously said : &quot; I
</p>
<p>have redressed you.&quot; Coloring deeply, she strove
</p>
<p>to hide her emotion, taking his arm and busying
</p>
<p>herself at the same time with the adjustment of her
</p>
<p>veil. In spite of some undefined apprehensions, she
</p>
<p>was grateful, relieved, and pleased ; and a slight
</p>
<p>pressure on the arm she held, spoke her feelings
</p>
<p>perhaps as distinctly as they were understood by
</p>
<p>herself.

<p>Douglas returned the pressure with more energy
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 87
</p>
<p>The words of Baker yet tingled in his ears ; and
</p>
<p>while they burned with the insult, the pain was more
</p>
<p>than soothed by the thoughts they had awakened.
</p>
<p>Were then the day-dreams of his boyhood to become
</p>
<p>realities ? He was not, as yet, conscious of any but
</p>
<p>a cousin s love for Delia. He could impute no other
</p>
<p>feeling to her. Bat should this mutual affection
</p>
<p>ripen into a more tender sentiment ! With whom
</p>
<p>could a man pass his days more happily, than with a
</p>
<p>woman so intelligent, so amiable, so prudent, so
</p>
<p>much a lady ? He did not love her. But he felt
</p>
<p>that to love her, and be beloved by her, would be a
</p>
<p>happy lot. The slight weight she rested on his arm
</p>
<p>was sweet to him. He wished the pressure was
</p>
<p>heavier. But she walked on, self-poised, and with
</p>
<p>a light and steady step over the rugged ground.
</p>
<p>Was not that step more confident, because she felt
</p>
<p>that he was there to aid her in case of need ? Even
</p>
<p>so, she seemed sufficient for herself in the resources
</p>
<p>of her own mind. Yet had she needed and accepted,
</p>
<p>and gratefully, though silently, acknowledged his
</p>
<p>protection. He was happy in having had occasion
</p>
<p>to protect her. Was not she the happier for it
</p>
<p>too? The heart will ask questions. Time gives

<p>ANONYMOUS,
</p>
<p>A FEW days after, Douglas handed his cousin the
</p>
<p>Allowing paper :
</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Baker begs leave to throw himself on the
</p>
<p>mercy of Miss Delia Trevor. He confesses his
</p>
<p>offence against her on Saturday last. He admits,
</p>
<p>with shame, that he did intend to wound her feel
</p>
<p>ings, and that he has nothing to offer in extenuation
</p>
<p>of his offence. He does not even presume to ask a
</p>
<p>pardon, which he acknowledges to be unmerited,
</p>
<p>and respectfully tenders the only atonement in his
</p>
<p>power, by assuring Miss Trevor that he will never
</p>
<p>again, intentionally, offend her by his presence.
</p>
<p>Signed, PHILIP BAKER.&quot;
</p>
<p>Delia read this curious document in silence, and,
</p>
<p>on looking up, found that Douglas had left the room.
</p>
<p>She ran after him, but he was gone, and for a day or

<p>two avoided any opportunity for farther explanation.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 89
</p>
<p>At length she found one, and asked by what means
</p>
<p>the paper had been procured.
</p>
<p>&quot; By proper means, my dear coz,&quot; said he, &quot; if
</p>
<p>the paper is a proper one.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Proper !&quot; exclaimed she, &quot; for me to receive,
</p>
<p>certainly. But for him to give ! Indeed, I pity any
</p>
<p>poor wretch who can be so abject. I am glad, at
</p>
<p>least, I am to see him no more. I should find it
</p>
<p>hard to behave to him as becomes myself!&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It would be hard,&quot; said Douglas, &quot;but as you
</p>
<p>always will behave as becomes yourself, hard though
</p>
<p>it be, it was right you should be spared the trial.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; This is your doing then ?&quot; said she.
</p>
<p>&quot;No questions, coz,&quot; replied Douglas. &quot;I must
</p>
<p>behave as becomes me too.&quot;
</p>
<p>This put an effectual stop to farther inquiry, and
</p>
<p>the slight concealment did but deepen Delia s sense
</p>
<p>of the service Douglas had rendered her. While she
</p>
<p>admired the delicacy which, at once, veiled and
</p>
<p>adorned his chivalrous character; he, on his part,
</p>
<p>felt greater pleasure at having redressed her wrong,
</p>
<p>because the affair had taken such a turn as to conceal
</p>
<p>the part that he had acted. The ties thus formed in
</p>
<p>secret, are doubly sacred and doubly sweet. The
</p>
<p>heart involuntarily classes them with those chaste
</p>
<p>mysteries which the vulgar eye must not profane
</p>
<p>They become the theme of thoughts which some
</p>
<p>times rise up, and kindle the cheek, and light the
</p>
<p>eye, and then sink down again and hide themselves

</p>
<p>But this privacy was destined to be invaded by
</p>
<p>one person, at least ; and that, the very one from
</p>
<p>whom Douglas would most anxiously have concealed
</p>
<p>the whole affair. Yet there was no person to whose
</p>
<p>tenderness, delicacy, and affection for both parties, it
</p>
<p>could have been more fitly confided. In short, Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, one day, placed in the hands of his son a let
</p>
<p>ter, in the President s own hand-writing, of which the
</p>
<p>following is a copy :
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, March 3d, 1849.
</p>
<p>MY DEAR SIR : I hasten to lay before you a piece
</p>
<p>of information which touches you nearly. Though I
</p>
<p>receive it at the hands of one who has the highest
</p>
<p>claims to my confidence, I yet trust it will prove to
</p>
<p>have originated in mistake.
</p>
<p>It is said that your son, Lieutenant Trevor, on
</p>
<p>receiving the news of the late treasonable proceed
</p>
<p>ings of some of the southern States, openly vindi
</p>
<p>cated them ; and that he spoke freely in defence of
</p>
<p>the principal agent in their most wicked attempt to
</p>
<p>league themselves with the enemies of their country*
</p>
<p>It is said, moreover, that, in doing this, he insulted
</p>
<p>and fastened a quarrel on one, whom I have great
</p>
<p>reason to esteem for his uniform devotion to the
</p>
<p>Union. The regular course for such a charge against
</p>
<p>an officer, holding a commission in the army of the
</p>
<p>United States, is one which I would not willingly

<p>pursue, in the case of the son of one of my earliest

<p>and most cherished friends. As Lieutenant Trevor
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 91
</p>
<p>is now at home, on furlough, I address this letter to
</p>
<p>you to be laid before him. I have no doubt he will
</p>
<p>readily give the necessary explanations, and, in so
</p>
<p>doing, afford me a new occasion for displaying that
</p>
<p>regard for you and yours, with which I am,
</p>
<p>Dear sir, your friend,
</p>
<p>MARTIN VAN BUREN.
</p>
<p>&quot; Can you tell me what this means ? &quot; said the
</p>
<p>mild old gentleman to his son.
</p>
<p>&quot; As I remember,&quot; replied Douglas, &quot; the circum
</p>
<p>stances under which I heard of the events alluded to,
</p>
<p>I think, I can give a guess at the meaning. It mean?
</p>
<p>that my cousin was insulted, in my presence, and
</p>
<p>that I protected her, as was my duty.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And how does it happen that I never heard of
</p>
<p>it? Who was the person, and what has become of
</p>
<p>the affair?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It has all blown over,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; and I had
</p>
<p>hardly expected it would ever be spoken of again.
</p>
<p>Delia alone knew of it from me, as it was right she
</p>
<p>should. I have never mentioned, nor has my friend.
</p>
<p>I am sure she has not ; and what the other party can
</p>
<p>promise himself from the exposure, I am sure I can
</p>
<p>not tell.&quot;
</p>
<p>u The thing is now made public, at all events ;
</p>
<p>and both as your father, and as the friend of the
</p>
<p>President, it is right that I should know all about
</p>
<p>it.&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; Certainly, sir,&quot; replied Douglas, &quot; you shall know
</p>
<p>9 2. The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>all ; and when you do, I need not explain why I
</p>
<p>have never told you before.&quot;
</p>
<p>He left the room, and soon returned with a bundle
</p>
<p>of papers. From this he handed one to his father,
</p>
<p>which proved to be a challenge, in the most approved
</p>
<p>form, from him, the said Douglas Trevor, to Philip
</p>
<p>Baker, Esq. Then came a proposition to discuss
</p>
<p>from the other party ; then a flat demand of apo
</p>
<p>logy, or the alternative of, what is called, gentle
</p>
<p>manly satisfaction ; then an offer to apologize ;
</p>
<p>then the paper we have already seen ; and then the
</p>
<p>following :
</p>
<p>&quot; Philip Baker declares, on his honor, that he meant
</p>
<p>no offence to Lieutenant Trevor by any words
</p>
<p>addressed to him on Saturday last ; and that he
</p>
<p>deeply regrets having spoken any which may
</p>
<p>have sounded offensively in the ears of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Trevor.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; This will do,&quot; said Mr. Trevor. &quot; It only shows
</p>
<p>that you have acted as became a soldier and a gentle
</p>
<p>man. These papers show clearly that the quarrel
</p>
<p>began in an insult to your cousin, which you were
</p>
<p>bound to resent. This will be perfectly satisfactory
</p>
<p>to the President.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Doubtless it would be,&quot; said Douglas, promptly ;
</p>
<p>&quot; but so much of the affair as implicates my cousin s
</p>
<p>name must go no farther.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But it is that,&quot; replied Mr. Trevor, &quot; which
</p>
<p>shows the cause of the quarrel. The other papers

</p>
<p>only show that you fancied an intention to insult
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 93
</p>
<p>where none existed. This would tally too well with
</p>
<p>what the President has heard.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Be it so,&quot; answered Douglas calmly. &quot; If the
</p>
<p>President is never satisfied till I furnish a paper
</p>
<p>which is to blend my cousin s name with a public
</p>
<p>discussion, he must remain dissatisfied. I cannot
</p>
<p>help it. Better to have suffered the insult to pass
</p>
<p>unnoticed, than to make a lady s name the theme of
</p>
<p>guard-house wit.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Bless you, my noble boy,&quot; said the admiring
</p>
<p>father. &quot; You are right, and there is no help for it.
</p>
<p>But what shall I say to the President ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What you please. The conclusions you draw
</p>
<p>from what you know, he is welcome to. The facts
</p>
<p>are with you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Certainly,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, after a musing
</p>
<p>pause ; &quot; certainly he will trust in my general assur
</p>
<p>ance that his information is, to my certain knowledge,
</p>
<p>erroneous. This will do. It must be sufficient.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It must do,&quot; said Douglas, &quot;whether it will or
</p>
<p>no. In the mean time, my dear sir, let me beg that
</p>
<p>the affair may go no farther, even in the family.
</p>
<p>Delia alone knows of it, and she only knows as much
</p>
<p>as may be gathered from that paper, a duplicate of
</p>
<p>which is her s by right. I therefore beg that you
</p>
<p>will say nothing about it, even to her.&quot;
</p>
<p>And he* did say nothing to her; but Douglas
</p>
<p>observed that that night, when she held up her lip
</p>
<p>for his paternal kiss, the kind old gentleman gave it

</p>
<p>That proud humility that dignified obedience. BUBKE.
</p>
<p>THE visit of Delia to her uncle now drew to a
</p>
<p>close, and she prepared for her return home. It
</p>
<p>was settled that she should be accompanied by
</p>
<p>Douglas, Arthur, and Yirginia, who were to spend
</p>
<p>a few weeks with her father.
</p>
<p>On the road, Douglas felt more and more the duty
</p>
<p>and the privilege of being the protector of his
</p>
<p>cousin, and, by the time they reached the end of
</p>
<p>their journey, he had discovered that the latter was
</p>
<p>as precious as the former was sacred. Some such
</p>
<p>thought had stolen into his mind while he was yet
</p>
<p>at home, but that was not the place to mention
</p>
<p>the subject to her ; and he had determined to im
</p>
<p>pose upon himself the most scrupulous restraint,
</p>
<p>until he should have restored her honorably to her
</p>
<p>father s arms.
</p>
<p>Two days travel brought them to the residence of
</p>
<p>Mr. Bernard Trevor, on the banks of the Koanoke.
</p>
<p>They found him laid up with a fit of the gout,
</p>
<p>which, while it confined him to the house, produced
</p>

<p>96 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>pain was, for tlie moment, forgotten ; and, flinging
</p>
<p>away his flannels and crutches, he sprang to his
</p>
<p>feet and caught her in his arms. At the same time,
</p>
<p>Arthur and Yirginia pressed forward for their wel
</p>
<p>come, which they, in their turn, received.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Trevor was not the only one
</p>
<p>who forgot himself at the sight of Delia. Poor old
</p>
<p>Carlo, starting from his slumbers on the hearth-rug,
</p>
<p>had recognized his young mistress, and was mani
</p>
<p>festing his joy at her return with boisterous fond
</p>
<p>ness, when one of his feet saluted the inflamed toe
</p>
<p>of his master. In an agony, which none but they
</p>
<p>who have felt it can conceive, the old gentleman
</p>
<p>sank into his chair. Here he remained for some
</p>
<p>minutes, unconscious of every thing but his suffer
</p>
<p>ings, while the soft hand of his daughter replaced
</p>
<p>and soothed the tortured limb.
</p>
<p>At length, recovering enough to look around, his
</p>
<p>eye fell on Douglas, who stood aloof, waiting to be
</p>
<p>introduced. Some little tag of military foppery,
</p>
<p>which always clings to the undress of an officer,
</p>
<p>satisfied Mr. Trevor who he was. Stretching out
</p>
<p>his hand, he said : &quot; Ah ! Douglas, my dear boy !
</p>
<p>How glad I am to see you ! But I ought not to
</p>
<p>have recognized you, you dog ! standing back there
</p>
<p>with your hat under your arm, as if waiting your
</p>
<p>mm of presentation at a levee. Perhaps you don t
</p>
<p>remember me. I certainly should not have known
</p>
<p>you, but for the circumstances under which I see

<p>you. But what of that ? Was it not yesterday you
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 97
</p>
<p>were sitting on my knee, and hanging about my
</p>
<p>neck ? Yes, it was yesterday ; though we have both
</p>
<p>dreamed a great deal since. But dreams must give
</p>
<p>way to realities ; so let us vote it yesterday, and
</p>
<p>meet to-day as we parted last night.&quot;
</p>
<p>Tins singular accoste had the desired effect, and
</p>
<p>Douglas felt, at once, as if he had been with his
</p>
<p>uncle all his life.
</p>
<p>&quot; You forget, my dear sir,&quot; said he, &quot; that I was
</p>
<p>intercepted by one whose privilege, I am sure, you
</p>
<p>would not have me dispute, though he has abused it
</p>
<p>so cruelly.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You mean the dog ?&quot; said Mr. Trevor. u . Poor
</p>
<p>old Carlo ! Come to your master, my poor fellow!
</p>
<p>No ; your privilege shall never be invaded. We are
</p>
<p>both past service now, and must learn to sympathize
</p>
<p>with each other. If you cannot understand the
</p>
<p>nature of a gouty toe, I hope I shall always have
</p>
<p>heart enough to understand yours. Give me a rough
</p>
<p>coat, or a black skin, for a true friend ; one that will
</p>
<p>not grudge any superior advantages that I may pos
</p>
<p>sess. Tom,&quot; added he, in a tone of marked gentle
</p>
<p>ness, &quot; the fire is low. No, not yourself, old man,&quot;
</p>
<p>he continued, as the negro whom he addressed
</p>
<p>moved toward the door ; &quot; not you, my good old
</p>
<p>friend. Just ring the bell, and let one of those lazy
</p>
<p>dogs in the kitchen bring in some wood. But why
</p>
<p>don t you speak to your master Douglas ? I am sure

<p>98 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; I m mighty proud to see yon, sir,&quot; said the old
</p>
<p>mail, taking the offered hand of Douglas, with an air
</p>
<p>of affectionate humility. &quot; But it was not my place,
</p>
<p>sir,&quot; added he, answering his master s words, &quot; to
</p>
<p>speak first. I made sure master Douglas would re
</p>
<p>member me after a while.&quot;*
</p>
<p>&quot; I do remember you, Tom,&quot; said Douglas, cor
</p>
<p>dially, &quot; and many a time, on parade, have I been
</p>
<p>thankful to you for teaching me to hold my reins
</p>
<p>and manage my horse.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You will find it hard,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, gravely,
</p>
<p>u to convince Torn that you remember him, if you
</p>
<p>call him by that name. Tom is Delia s daddy, and
</p>
<p>Lucia s, and Arthur s, and Virginia s daddy, and so
</p>
<p>will be to the day of his death. If ever he ceases to
</p>
<p>be your daddy, too, Douglas, I shall move to
</p>
<p>reconsider the vote that we just now passed unani
</p>
<p>mously.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It is a vice the northern air has blown upon
</p>
<p>* I crave the forbearance of all critics, who have taken their ideas
</p>
<p>of a Virginia house-servant from Csesar Thompson, or any such cari
</p>
<p>catures, for giving Tom s own words, and his own pronunciation of
</p>
<p>them. It is not my fault if there is but little peculiarity in his phrase
</p>
<p>ology. His language was never elegant, and frequently ungramrnati-
</p>
<p>cal. But he spoke better than the peasantry of most countries, though
</p>
<p>he said some things that a white man would not say ; perhaps, be
</p>
<p>cause he had some feelings to which the white man is a stranger. A
</p>
<p>white man, for example, would have said he was glad to see Douglas,
</p>
<p>whether he were so or not. Old Tom said he was proud to see him,
</p>
<p>because he was proud to recognize his former pet in the handsome and

</p>
<p>me,&quot; said Douglas, blushing. &quot; I felt the truth of
</p>
<p>what you said just now, and am not more sure of
</p>
<p>being affectionately remembered by any that I used
</p>
<p>to know, than by my good old daddy.&quot;
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor now requested Tom to see that the
</p>
<p>horses of the travellers were properly attended to ;
</p>
<p>and the negro left the room.
</p>
<p>&quot; What a graceful and gentlemanly old man !&quot;
</p>
<p>said Douglas, looking after him.
</p>
<p>&quot; His manners,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; are exactly
</p>
<p>suited to his situation. Their characteristic is proud
</p>
<p>humility. The opposite is servile sulkiness, of which,
</p>
<p>1 suspect, Douglas, you have seen no little.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have seen nothing else,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; among
</p>
<p>the servants in the North. If the tempers of our
</p>
<p>negroes were as ferocious, and their feelings as
</p>
<p>hostile, we should have to cut their throats in self-
</p>
<p>defence in six months.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am glad,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; that you have not
</p>
<p>learned to sacrifice your own experience to the fan
</p>
<p>ciful theories of the Amis de Noirs, at least on this
</p>
<p>point. The time, I hope, will come when you will
</p>
<p>see, if you do not already, the fallacy of all their cant
</p>
<p>and sophistry on the subject of domestic slavery.
</p>
<p>You will then bless God that your lot has been cast
</p>
<p>where the freedom of all, who, in the economy of
</p>
<p>Providence, are capable of freedom, is rendered
</p>
<p>practicable by the particular form in which the

<p>loo The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not sure,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; that I exactly
</p>
<p>comprehend you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Perhaps not,&quot; replied the uncle. &quot; And that
</p>
<p>reminds me that I am trespassing on forbidden
</p>
<p>ground. Just there, the differences of opinion be
</p>
<p>tween your father and myself commence ; and from
</p>
<p>that point they diverge so much, that I do not feel at
</p>
<p>liberty to speak to his son on certain topics.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But why not, my dear sir ? You surely cannot
</p>
<p>expect me to think with my father on all subjects;
</p>
<p>and you would not have me do so, when you thought
</p>
<p>him wrong. I do not profess to be deeply studied
</p>
<p>in these matters ; but, between your lights and his,
</p>
<p>I might hope to find my way to the truth.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;There are some subjects, Douglas,&quot; replied Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, with solemnity, &quot;on which it is better to be
</p>
<p>in error than to differ, totally and conscientiously,
</p>
<p>from a father. Delia is but a girl ; but should she
</p>
<p>have come back to me changed in her sentiments
</p>
<p>(opinions she cannot have) in regard to certain mat
</p>
<p>ters, I should feel that I had been grievously wronged
</p>
<p>by any one who had wrought the change. I know
</p>
<p>your father has not done this ; and I must do as I
</p>
<p>would be done by, and as I am sure I have been
</p>
<p>done by.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot conceive,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; what sort of
</p>
<p>subjects those can be, concerning which error in opi
</p>
<p>nion is better than truth, under any circumstances.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Those,&quot; replied Mr. Trevor, &quot;in which truth

<p>would bring duty in conflict with duty.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 101
</p>
<p>&quot; Nay, then,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; there is no danger
</p>
<p>of my conversion in such cases. I should take that
</p>
<p>as an infallible proof that doctrines leading to such
</p>
<p>consequences must be lalse.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Your proposed test of truth is so specious,&quot;
</p>
<p>observed Mr. Trevor, &quot; that I will go so far as to say
</p>
<p>one word to convince you of its fallacy. If ever I
</p>
<p>take you in hand, my lad, my first lesson will be to
</p>
<p>teach you to examine plausibilities closely, and to
</p>
<p>distrust summary and simple arguments on topics
</p>
<p>about which men differ.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Does any one, then, maintain,&quot; asked Douglas,
</p>
<p>&quot; that two opinions which impose conflicting duties
</p>
<p>can both he right ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I shall not answer that,&quot; answered Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>&quot; You shall answer it yourself. You are a soldier
</p>
<p>of the United States. Suppose an insurrection.
</p>
<p>What, in that case, would be your duty ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; To fight against the rebels&quot; replied Douglas,
</p>
<p>promptly.
</p>
<p>&quot; And, thinking as you do, so it would be. Now,
</p>
<p>suppose your father to be one of those same
</p>
<p>rebels,&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I see,&quot; said Douglas, after a pause, in which lie
</p>
<p>colored to the tips of his ears ; &quot; I see that you are
</p>
<p>right.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; In what?&quot; asked Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>&quot;In maintaining,&quot; he replied, &quot;that two opinions

<p>which prescribe conflicting duties, may both be

</p>
<p>&quot;But I have not said so,&quot; replied Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>smiling.
</p>
<p>&quot; But you have proved it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I am not quite sure of that. Here is another
</p>
<p>summary and simple looking argument, on a diffi
</p>
<p>cult question. My own rule is, i distrust and
</p>
<p>re-examine? :
</p>
<p>He stopped short, while Douglas looked at him
</p>
<p>with a perplexed and wondering eye. He at length
</p>
<p>went on : &quot;I shall not break faith with your father
</p>
<p>by teaching you to think. You have the proposi
</p>
<p>tions ; and you see there is fallacy somewhere.
</p>
<p>Analyse the subject, and find your own result. But
</p>
<p>come, my boy this is poor entertainment for a hun
</p>
<p>gry traveller. Your aunt has some dinner for you
</p>
<p>by this time, and here is Tom come to tell us so.
</p>
<p>Come, give me your arm, and help me to the din

<p>ing room.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; My dear father,&quot; said Delia, &quot; that is my office.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Both ! both ! my children !&quot; exclaimed the old
</p>
<p>man, throwing away his other crutch. &quot; Why, now
</p>
<p>I am better off than a man with sound limbs.&quot;
</p>
<p>In the dining room, Mrs. Trevor awaited them.
</p>
<p>A hasty greeting was all she had allowed herself on
</p>
<p>the first arrival of the party ; after which, she
</p>
<p>betook herself to the duties of housewifery and
</p>
<p>hospitality. They found her standing at the back
</p>
<p>of her chair ; and Douglas, as he entered, thought

<p>he had rarely seen a more striking figure. She was

</p>
<p>graceful in her person : and with a countenance
</p>
<p>beaming with frankness, animation, and intelligence.
</p>
<p>She had been a beautiful woman, and, being much
</p>
<p>younger than her husband, was still handsome. She
</p>
<p>extended her hand to Douglas as he entered, and
</p>
<p>placing him near her, so mingled the courtesy due
</p>
<p>to a stranger with the cordiality of an old acquaint
</p>
<p>ance, as to make him feel all the comfort and ease
</p>
<p>of home, without ever losing a sense of that bland
</p>
<p>influence, which, while it secures decorum, imposes
</p>
<p>no constraint.
</p>
<p>&quot; Would you have known me ?&quot; asked the lady.
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say I could have identified you,&quot; he
</p>
<p>replied ; &quot; but I should have recognized you as one
</p>
<p>I ought to know.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And your uncle ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Not by sight, certainly,&quot; said - Douglas. &quot;I
</p>
<p>remember him too distinctly for that. He is too
</p>
<p>much altered. But I know him by his manners and
</p>
<p>conversation. These I never could forget; and
</p>
<p>these are the same, and peculiarly his own. I
</p>
<p>remember how he used to exercise my mind, and
</p>
<p>make me talk; and yet never let me talk without
</p>
<p>thinking.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And has he been at the old game already ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; O yes ! He has set me to revising and doubt

<p>not be surprised if I go away convinced tiiat I have
</p>
<p>seven fingers on one hand, and but two on the

<p>other ; nine in all.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He has not touched on politics ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; no ! That subject he has tabooed ; and I am
</p>
<p>truly sorry for it / for while I never desire to waver
</p>
<p>in my allegiance to the United States, I am anxious
</p>
<p>to understand what may become m&amp;gt;e as a Virginian.
</p>
<p>If I may judge from what my father says, there is
</p>
<p>no man from whom I could learn more on that sub
</p>
<p>ject than my uncle.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; His lesson would not be a short one,&quot; replied the
</p>
<p>lady. &quot; His commandments on behalf of the State
</p>
<p>tire only second in authority with him to the deca
</p>
<p>logue ; arid they do not lie in as small a compass.
</p>
<p>But he fears he might teach you some things your
</p>
<p>father would wish you to unlearn.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I ain not so sure of that,&quot; answered Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot;I meant to say that there is no man whose judg
</p>
<p>ment my father holds in higher respect.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is something new,&quot; said Mrs. Trevor, color
</p>
<p>ing, and with a countenance in which there was some
</p>
<p>expression of wounded pride. &quot; I should be glad to
</p>
<p>be convinced of that.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Why should you doubt it?&quot; asked the young
</p>
<p>man, with surprise.
</p>
<p>&quot; Because it has not always been so ; and. as I claim

<p>a woman s privilege to admire my husband above all

<p>highly of his brother s wisdom and prudence, that he
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. loj
</p>
<p>has always borne to be thought the reverse of him in
</p>
<p>these things, and quietly submitted to be condemned
</p>
<p>as a heretic on account of opinions, of the correctness
</p>
<p>of which he found it impossible to doubt.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; There may have been something of this,&quot; said Dou
</p>
<p>glas, earnestly ; &quot; but I assure you it is not so now.
</p>
<p>I do believe one motive with my father for wishing
</p>
<p>me to make this visit, is his desire that I should hear
</p>
<p>both sides ; and have the benefit of the sagacity and
</p>
<p>manly sense which he imputes to my uncle.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He will have to tell him so plainly,&quot; replied Mrs.
</p>
<p>Trevor, &quot;before he will open his mouth to you. But
</p>
<p>I shall be less scrupulous; and I am in daily expec
</p>
<p>tation of a friend whose frankness will leave you no
</p>
<p>cause to regret your uncle s reserve.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; I shall leave you to find out. You will see many
</p>
<p>here who feel and think with your uncle, and who
</p>
<p>come to him to compare thoughts and concert mea
</p>
<p>sures. Among them is the man on whom the desti
</p>
<p>nies of his country depend.&quot;
</p>
<p>u The only man of whom I should predicate that,&quot;
</p>
<p>replied Douglas, with some quickness, &quot;is one who, I
</p>
<p>am very sure, never comes here.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; There is a good and an evil principle,&quot; said Mrs.
</p>
<p>Trevor. &quot; Events alike depend on both. You speak

<p>of the one of these /of the other.&quot;

<p>rage us to be too unreserved. But your candor and
</p>
<p>good sense may be trusted to lead you right, without
</p>
<p>our guidance.&quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas felt the truth of the first part of this speech.
</p>
<p>Whether anything more than a complimentary turn
</p>
<p>of expression was meant in the closing words, he did
</p>
<p>not know. But if the lady intended to express a hope
</p>
<p>that he might become a convert to the disorganizing
</p>
<p>notions which he feared were prevalent in her circle,
</p>
<p>he took the liberty to doubt whether her anticipations
</p>
<p>would ever be realized. He now changed the con
</p>
<p>versation, and determined to take a second thought
</p>
<p>before he invited discussions which might mislead
</p>
<p>him. He found he had to do with active and vigor
</p>
<p>ous minds, against which he might, perhaps, vainly
</p>
<p>strive to defend himself, even with truth on his side.
</p>
<p>He resolved, therefore, to yield to the inclination
</p>

<p>CHAPTEE XII.
</p>
<p>My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre ;
</p>
<p>111 bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,
</p>
<p>For I have murdered where I would not kill.
</p>
<p>SHAKSPEARF..
</p>
<p>I SHOULD detain the reader with matters not worthy
</p>
<p>of a place in this grave history, if I descended to the
</p>
<p>particulars of the intercourse between Douglas Trevor
</p>
<p>and his charming cousin. It is enough to say, that
</p>
<p>he found himself, daily, more and more happy in her
</p>
<p>society; and was more and more convinced that it
</p>
<p>was a necessary ingredient in his happiness. It was
</p>
<p>not long before he concluded that he would not live
</p>
<p>without her ; and, having told her so, was referred by
</p>
<p>her to her father.
</p>
<p>Nothing doubting that his communication would be
</p>
<p>favorably received, Douglas was eager to break the
</p>
<p>matter to his uncle, and ask his approbation of his
</p>
<p>suit. To his utter amazement, the old gentleman,
</p>
<p>assuming an air at once serious and tender, said: &quot;My
</p>
<p>dear boy, had I the world to choose from, there is no
</p>
<p>man to whom I would sooner trust my daughter s
</p>
<p>happiness. But circumstances forbid your union. 1

<p>speak advisedly and sadly. I have seen what was
</p>
<p>lo8 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>passing. I anticipated this communication, and deli
</p>
<p>berately decided on my answer.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; For God s sake, sir ! &quot; exclaimed Douglas, trem-
</p>
<p>Dling with impatience, &quot; what do you mean ; and
</p>
<p>what is your answer ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I mean,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; and my answer is,
</p>
<p>that circumstances forbid it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Surely,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; your objection is not
</p>
<p>to the nearness of blood.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not addicted to any such exploded super
</p>
<p>stition,&quot; said Mr. Trevor. &quot; But my daughter must
</p>
<p>never marry one that wears that dress.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I like my profession, sir,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; but
</p>
<p>will change it without hesitation.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; God forbid ! &quot; replied the old gentleman. &quot; I
</p>
<p>would not have you do so ; and were you so inclined,
</p>
<p>it would not be in your choice.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I can resign when I will, and my resignation will
</p>
<p>certainly be accepted.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Still you would be a soldier, and you must be a
</p>
<p>soldier. Peace is not in our choice, and the time is
</p>
<p>at hand when every man, who can wield a sword,
</p>
<p>must do so.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I do not understand you, sir,&quot; said Douglas in
</p>
<p>amazement.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am aware you do not. It is time you should.
</p>
<p>Yon have now a right to understand me ; and I have
</p>
<p>a right to be understood by you. We are on the
</p>
<p>eve of what you will call rebellion. I shall call it a

<p>war of right and liberty. I arn old and infirm ; but
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 109
</p>
<p>I am not always imprisoned by the gout ; and no
</p>
<p>thing but physical inability shall keep me from sus
</p>
<p>taining, with my sword, a cause that I have always
</p>
<p>advocated with tongue and pen. It will be bad
</p>
<p>enough to meet the sons of my brother in arms
</p>
<p>against my country. That I cannot help. But it is
</p>
<p>in my choice whether I shall thus meet my daugh
</p>
<p>ter s husband. That must never be.&quot;
</p>
<p>He ceased to speak, and the young man, dizzy
</p>
<p>with mixed thoughts and feelings, sat gazing at him
</p>
<p>in mute astonishment. At length, starting up, he
</p>
<p>was about to leave the room, when the old gentle
</p>
<p>man held out his hand. Douglas gave his, and his
</p>
<p>uncle, pressing it cordially, went on: &quot;My son,&quot;
</p>
<p>said he, &quot; you are the only male of my race in whom
</p>
<p>I recognize any thing which tells me that the same
</p>
<p>blood flows in our veins. We cannot help the sel
</p>
<p>fishness that disposes us to love those who resemble
</p>
<p>us even in our faults. It might be better for you not
</p>
<p>to resemble me, and perhaps I ought to wish that
</p>
<p>you did not. But I cannot. I find it easier to forget
</p>
<p>that you are not my son, and to love you as if you
</p>
<p>were. The hope that you may yet be so, is hardly
</p>
<p>less dear to me than to you. That you will be so, if
</p>
<p>1 you outlive the envy of those awful events which
</p>
<p>shall open your eyes, I can hardly doubt. But these
</p>
<p>things must do their work. The convictions which
</p>
<p>shall make you throw off the badges of allegiance
</p>
<p>to him whose sworn foe I am, must come of them

<p>no The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>respect jour honor by saying nothing to shake* your
</p>
<p>faith in him, and to his cause. In the mean time, 1
</p>
<p>can but hope for the best. I do hope ; and I invite
</p>
<p>you to hope. But for the present, hope must be our
</p>
<p>all. Things must remain as they are until it pleases
</p>
<p>God so to order events as to make your sense of duty
</p>
<p>to your country consistent with that which, as my
</p>
<p>daughter s husband, you will owe to her and to hei
</p>
<p>father.&quot;
</p>
<p>I leave the reader to imagine the consternation of
</p>
<p>Douglas at this decisive condemnation of his pro
</p>
<p>posed plan of happiness, and at the astounding intel
</p>
<p>ligence that accompanied it. He saw plainly that
</p>
<p>his uncle spoke not conjecturally, but from certain
</p>
<p>knowledge ; and he was sure, that under such cir
</p>
<p>cumstances, no attachment could tempt Delia to
</p>
<p>marry him. He did not therefore attempt to con
</p>
<p>tinue the discussion of the subject, but left the house
</p>
<p>and wandered into the fields.
</p>
<p>The tumult of his mind rendered him incapable of
</p>
<p>reflexion. I shall not attempt to analyze the chaos
</p>
<p>of his thoughts. But light, not darkness, floated on
</p>
<p>the surface. The hand of Delia was indeed with
</p>
<p>held for a season, but he was not forbidden to hope
</p>
<p>that it might one day or other be his. Should it
</p>
<p>ever be true that rebellion was awake, and that civil
</p>
<p>war was at hand, he was not told that fidelity to his
</p>
<p>standard would be imputed to him as a crime. The
</p>
<p>strife must end one way or the other, and that being

</p>
<p>past, he would no longer be condemned to the hard
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 111
</p>
<p>alternative of relinquishing the object of his most
</p>
<p>ardent wish, or exhibiting the shocking spectacle of
</p>
<p>a husband warring against the father of his wife.
</p>
<p>But what was to be done in the mean time ?
</p>
<p>Should the old gentleman take the field, he must
</p>
<p>find some other theatre of action, and his father s
</p>
<p>influence with the President would readily procure
</p>
<p>him that indulgence. As to the idea of renouncing
</p>
<p>what he had been taught to call his allegiance to the
</p>
<p>Federal Government, and aiding to maintain the
</p>
<p>dishonored sovereignty of his native State, it did not
</p>
<p>enter his mind. Yet there was something in its
</p>
<p>workings that suddenly awakened an undefined
</p>
<p>interest in the late correspondence between his father
</p>
<p>and the President. He no sooner thought of this,
</p>
<p>than his restless wanderings received a definite direc
</p>
<p>tion to the neighboring post-office.
</p>
<p>Here he found a letter from his father, containing
</p>
<p>litle more than the copy of one from the President.
</p>
<p>Its contents were as follows :
</p>
<p>&quot;WASHINGTON, March 20, 1849.
</p>
<p>- &quot; MY DEAR SIK : Your letter has been received,
</p>
<p>and, to me, is entirely satisfactory. But I regret to
</p>
<p>inform you that, to those friends whom I feel myself
</p>
<p>bound to consult, it is not so. Such of them, indeed,
</p>
<p>as are acquainted with your high character, do not
</p>
<p>intimate a doubt that a full explanation of the affaii
</p>
<p>would entirely justify your assurance that I. have

</p>
<p>&quot; But they remind me that my information comes
</p>
<p>from a source entitled to all respect and confidence,
</p>
<p>and that, by making thus light of it, I may estrange
</p>
<p>a friend, whom they regard as hardly less valuable
</p>
<p>and meritorious than him whose feelings I wish to
</p>
<p>save. They represent, moreover, that the affair is
</p>
<p>bruited in the army, and that some officers are mal
</p>
<p>content at the thought that a charge so serious
</p>
<p>should be passed over without inquiry, on the bare
</p>
<p>assurance of a father s confidence in the innocence
</p>
<p>of his son.
</p>
<p>&quot; Under these circumstances, should Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Trevor not demand a court of inquiry, I am fearful
</p>
<p>I may be constrained, against iny wish, to order a
</p>
<p>court-martial. Need I tell you, my dear sir, how
</p>
<p>earnestly I deprecate the necessity of a measure,
</p>
<p>which must so nearly touch one to whose friendship
</p>
<p>I feel so much indebted, and whose loyalty to the
</p>
<p>Union and its officers has always been so conspicuous
</p>
<p>and steady.
</p>
<p>&quot; I remain, my dear sir,
</p>
<p>&quot; Your assured friend,

<p>To this copy Mr. Trevor added these words :
</p>
<p>&quot; The discretion, good sense, and proper feeling
</p>
<p>you have already manifested in this affair, have been

<p>so conspicuous, that I choose ratber to trust its future

<p>by any advice of mine. Yet, there is one person,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 113
</p>
<p>my dear boy, with whom I would have you to advise.
</p>
<p>Your uncle has been a soldier in his youth, and is
</p>
<p>profoundly versed in all matters of military etiquette
</p>
<p>He is, moreover, a clear-sighted and sagacious man&amp;gt;
</p>
<p>who will, at once, see this matter in all its bearings
</p>
<p>and relations to other subjects. His views are not
</p>
<p>only, in general, more comprehensive than mine, but
</p>
<p>I suspect he is, at this moment, aware of considera
</p>
<p>tions which might properly influence you, and which
</p>
<p>are hidden from me. I know his guarded and deli
</p>
<p>cate reserve, in all his communications with my
</p>
<p>children, where he apprehends a difference of opinion
</p>
<p>between himself and me. Tell him that he has my
</p>
<p>thanks for it ; but that I shall be yet more obliged,
</p>
<p>if, in this instance, he will cast it aside entirely, and
</p>
<p>give you the benefit of all his thoughts, as if you
</p>
<p>were his own son. I fear my last days may be spent
</p>
<p>in bitter regrets that I myself have not heretofore

<p>made more avail of them.&quot;

</p>
<p>CHAPTEE XIII.
</p>
<p>It is enough to grieve the heart,
</p>
<p>To think that God s fair world hath been
</p>
<p>The footstool of a thing so mean.
</p>
<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>THE evening was far advanced, when Douglas
</p>
<p>again reached his uncle s house. He went imme
</p>
<p>diately to his room, and sent to request a private
</p>
<p>interview with Mr. Trevor. He was accordingly
</p>
<p>invited into the little study of the old gentleman,
</p>
<p>where he commonly sat surrounded by books and
</p>
<p>papers. On entering the room, he observed an
</p>
<p>elderly gentleman, whom he had never seen before,
</p>
<p>pass out at a door communicating with the drawing-
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>Douglas now silently handed his father s letter to
</p>
<p>his uncle. Mr. Trevor read it attentively, and again
</p>
<p>and again looked over it, resting his eye on parti
</p>
<p>cular passages, as if to possess himself of the full
</p>
<p>meaning of every expression. The subject was in
</p>
<p>itself interesting, and quite new to him. But he felt
</p>
<p>a yet deeper interest in the obscure intimations of a
</p>
<p>change in his brother s mind in regard to those mat
</p>
<p>ters about which they had so long and so painfully

</p>
<p>differed. Even if he was mistaken in this, it was
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 113
</p>
<p>consoling to find himself rising in the estimation of
</p>
<p>Mr. Hugh Trevor ; no longer regarded by him as
</p>
<p>rash, reckless, and inconsiderate, but consulted as a
</p>
<p>&quot; clear-sighted and sagacious man &quot; in an affair oi
</p>
<p>very great importance. He alone, who has been
</p>
<p>conscious of being thus undervalued by a friend at
</p>
<p>once beloved and respected, can estimate the satis
</p>
<p>faction which Mr. Trevor felt at that moment. If
</p>
<p>there was any mixture of alloy with this pleasure, it
</p>
<p>flowed from self-reproach. He had sometimes found
</p>
<p>it impossible to repress some little risings of resent
</p>
<p>merit, at finding his judgment habitually disabled bj
</p>
<p>his elder brother. He had indeed been once a little
</p>
<p>white-headed boy, when the other was a highly intel
</p>
<p>ligent and promising youth. But, at sixty, he was
</p>
<p>not quite content to be still looked on as a child.
</p>
<p>Yet, when he remarked the candor of his brother s
</p>
<p>language, and the self-abasing sadness of his tone,
</p>
<p>he was vexed to think that one unkind thought
</p>
<p>toward him had ever entered his mind.
</p>
<p>At length, he interrupted this train of thought, to
</p>
<p>ask of Douglas an explanation of the President s
</p>
<p>letter. In answer, he received a detailed account
</p>
<p>of the scene at the falls, and was permitted to read
</p>
<p>the correspondence which had grown out of it.
</p>
<p>&quot; I have heard something of this before,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor. &quot; Delia told me all that passed in her
</p>
<p>presence, and showed me Baker s palinode, which is
</p>
<p>rather the most extraordinary document that I ever

<p>saw. Why, the dog acknowledges that he actually
</p>
<p>ii6 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>intended to insult a lady. He might, at least, have
</p>
<p>had the grace to lie about it. False shame is bettei
</p>
<p>than no shame at all.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He would have been glad to put the matter on
</p>
<p>that footing,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; could he have got
</p>
<p>leave to do so. He sent me such a paper as you
</p>
<p>suppose, but I refused to receive it. His apology
</p>
<p>to me I knew to be false. It was, therefore, the
</p>
<p>more satisfactory because the more humiliating.
</p>
<p>But I sent him word that I would not take any thing
</p>
<p>to my cousin but the truth. Here,&quot; continued Doug
</p>
<p>las, &quot; is his first project of an apology, and of my
</p>
<p>rejection of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor read them, and then said : &quot; This is
</p>
<p>well. I knew you had acted handsomely, but how
</p>
<p>handsomely, I had not conceived of. But let me
</p>
<p>hear, I pray you, how all this has been tortured into
</p>
<p>an oifence against majesty.&quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas colored slightly at the word, and handed
</p>
<p>his uncle a copy of the President s first letter to his
</p>
<p>father. He had but to add an account of his subse
</p>
<p>quent conversation with his father, and Mr. Trevor
</p>
<p>was in possession of the whole affair.
</p>
<p>&quot; You see,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; that I am referred to
</p>
<p>you for advice, and that you are invited to say to
</p>
<p>me, unreservedly, what you will.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; / do see&quot; replied Mr. Trevor. &quot; that I have
</p>
<p>carte llanche, as far as depends on your father. But
</p>
<p>there are some things I would now say to his son,

</p>
<p>which it would not be proper to say to a soldier of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 117
</p>
<p>the United States. I cannot, therefore, discard all
</p>
<p>reserve, but all that he has ever imposed on me, I
</p>
<p>now shake off. Indeed, I should have done this
</p>
<p>now, without his permission. You are my son, ae
</p>
<p>well as his. You have shown that you know how to
</p>
<p>protect my daughter, and have fairly earned a right
</p>
<p>to protect her through life. Nay, no raptures : no
</p>
<p>thanks ! The exercise of this right must be post
</p>
<p>poned until affairs have taken a different shape from
</p>
<p>that they bear at present. But revenons a nos mou-
</p>
<p>tons /&quot; The question is, what you are to do to save
</p>
<p>this despicable, heartless wretch from the necessity
</p>
<p>of offending a wretch even baser than himself, whom
</p>
<p>he despises.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Whom do you mean ?&quot; asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; I mean,&quot; replied the other, &quot; the President and
</p>
<p>the elder Baker, that tame slave of power, that
</p>
<p>shameless, mercenary pander, who, having both
</p>
<p>talent and reputation, sold the one and sacrificed
</p>
<p>the other for office and infamy.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And is it for such a man,&quot; exclaimed Douglas,
</p>
<p>&quot; that I am required to make disclosures before a
</p>
<p>court of inquiry, or a court-martial, which delicacy
</p>
<p>and self-respect forbid ? Never! Be the alternative
</p>
<p>what it may, I shall never consent to it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You are right, my son,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; nor
</p>
<p>can I relieve you from the difficulty by authorizing
</p>
<p>the profanation of my daughter s name, to which

<p>Buch an investigation would lead. My duty on that

<p>head is peremptory, not discretionary. If your

<p>n8 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>father were any thing but the perfect gentleman he
</p>
<p>is, I might suspect that his reference to me was
</p>
<p>intended to elicit some such suggestion. But I
</p>
<p>know him better. I infer from his letter more than
</p>
<p>you discover there ; and I am not sure that the
</p>
<p>advice which I am most disposed to give, is that
</p>
<p>which he would be best pleased to see you follow.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What would that advice be ?&quot; asked Douglas,
</p>
<p>anxiously.
</p>
<p>&quot; Nay,&quot; replied the old gentleman, &quot; when I have
</p>
<p>made up my mind, you shall know.&quot;
</p>
<p>u But why not give me your thoughts,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>youth, &quot; and let us discuss them 2&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Because, circumstanced as you are, we cannot
</p>
<p>properly discuss them. I can but give you my judg
</p>
<p>ment, when I have formed it, and leave you to find
</p>
<p>out the reasons for it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; My own first thought,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; is to
</p>

<p>&quot; It was mine too,&quot; said the uncle, &quot; and there is
</p>
<p>therefore no occasion to discuss it. Though I had
</p>
<p>not sufficiently matured my opinion to announce it
</p>
<p>to you, I think I may promise, that if you come to
</p>
<p>that conclusion, I shall not dissent from it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; The only difficulty that I see in the way,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Douglas, &quot; is that an offer to resign is, under such
</p>
<p>circumstances, generally understood as a shrinking
</p>
<p>from inquiry.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It is so ; and the opinion is so far right, that,

</p>
<p>the infamy. It is a tacit consent to be infamous,
</p>
<p>only on condition that one may be safe.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You state the point with startling force,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the youth. &quot; And how would you distinguish this
</p>
<p>case from the one you suppose ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; By distinguishing the accusation from one of
</p>
<p>falsehood, peculation, or cowardice. Should you
</p>
<p>plead guilty to such charges as these, or seek to
</p>
<p>evade them by resignation, you stand dishonored.
</p>
<p>But read over the President s bill of indictment.
</p>
<p>Now suppose it true that you had entertained and
</p>
<p>avowed the sentiments there imputed to you, would
</p>
<p>there be any dishonor in that ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Certainly not ; unless my being an officer of the
</p>
<p>United States would make a difference.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Should that prevent you from thinking, or take
</p>
<p>away a freeman s right to express his thoughts ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It would seem not. But does it not make some
</p>
<p>difference ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Certainly. Shall I tell you what it is ? Such
</p>
<p>sentiments would make it your duty (not to the United
</p>
<p>States, but to Virginia and to yourself,) to resign.
</p>
<p>Now, it is because I have no mind to seduce a sol
</p>
<p>dier from his standard that I have been careful not
</p>
<p>to infuse such sentiments into you. If once you lay
</p>
<p>aside the panoply of the uniform, and throw away
</p>
<p>the amulet of the commission, I would not ensure
</p>
<p>you against opinions which you may have to main
</p>
<p>tain at the hazard of your life. But time presses.

<p>Your own suggestion disposes me to speak more
</p>
<p>12O The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>promptly and decidedly than I should otherwise
</p>
<p>have done. I therefore say, tender your resignation.
</p>
<p>But, if you have no objection, I should like to con
</p>
<p>sult a friend, on whose most hasty opinions I rely
</p>
<p>more than on the coolest judgment of others.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; If you mean my aunt,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; I know
</p>
<p>few persons on whose instinctive sense of propriety I
</p>
<p>should place more reliance.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; She would well deserve your confidence ; but 1

<p>mean the gentleman who left the room as you entered.
</p>
<p>He has been her friend for thirty years, and mine for
</p>
<p>more than half that time.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But to me,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; he is an utter stranger,
</p>
<p>and I feel some delicacy in consulting a stranger on
</p>
<p>such an occasion.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You forget,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; that all there is
</p>
<p>of delicacy in the case touches me as nearly as you.
</p>
<p>It is not you, a stranger, but I, an intimate friend,
</p>
<p>who propose to ask his advice. Charge that matter
</p>
<p>to my account, then, and merely decide for yourself,
</p>
<p>whether it may not be desirable to have the counsel
</p>
<p>of one as remarkable for scrupulous delicacy, as for
</p>
<p>sagacity and resource ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; There can be but one answer to that question,&quot;
</p>
<p>replied Douglas, &quot; and I shall therefore gladly take

<p>th benefit of his advice.&quot;

<p>Tom disappeared, and soon returned marshalling in
</p>
<p>Mr. B . He was a man apparently of sixty years
</p>
<p>of age, or more, slightly formed, but tall, erect, clean
</p>
<p>limbed, and sinewy. His vigor seemed little impaired
</p>
<p>by time, though his high and strong features made
</p>
<p>him look at least as old as he was. A light blue eye,
</p>
<p>clear and sparkling, quick in its glance, but settled
</p>
<p>and searching in its gaze, was the striking feature of
</p>
<p>his face. The sun had burned out all traces of his
</p>
<p>original complexion, and a silver hue had usurped the
</p>
<p>color of his hair. His whole appearance was impos
</p>
<p>ing, and while it commanded the respect due to the
</p>
<p>wisdom of age, seemed to claim no pity for its infir
</p>
<p>mities. To this sentiment, which enters so largely
</p>
<p>into the composition of that character which the world
</p>
<p>calls venerable, he certainly made no pretensions. No
</p>
<p>one would have called him venerable, though no

</p>
<p>THE frankness and cordiality of his manner, when
</p>
<p>introduced to Douglas, gave assurance that he took
</p>
<p>a great interest in the young man ; who felt, on his
</p>
<p>part, that he was in the presence of a man of no com
</p>
<p>mon mould, and that in that man be had found an
</p>
<p>efficient friend.
</p>
<p>&quot; And now, Tom,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; pass the word
</p>
<p>for coffee and privacy in this room.&quot;
</p>
<p>Tom bowed and withdrew, and Mr. Trevor, with
</p>
<p>out preface or apology, proceeded to lay the case
</p>
<p>before his friend. This he did with great precision
</p>
<p>of statement, while the other listened with an air
</p>
<p>which showed that no word was lost on him. Hav

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 123
</p>
<p>friend shall be made acquainted after resignation
</p>
<p>not before. But there are others which may be spoken
</p>
<p>of now. The alternative is a court of inquiry, a court-
</p>
<p>martial, or resignation. To the two first the same
</p>
<p>objection applies. Your nephew cannot expect any
</p>
<p>satisfactory result from either, but by the use of
</p>
<p>means which, I am sure, his delicacy would not pei
</p>
<p>mit him to use I mean the public use of a lady s
</p>
<p>name. Some people have a taste for that, and in
</p>
<p>other parts of the world it is all the rage. I thank
</p>
<p>God that the fashion has not reached us. A woman,
</p>
<p>exposed to notoriety, learns to bear and then to love
</p>
<p>it. When she gets to that, she should go North ;
</p>
<p>write books ; patronize abolition societies ; or keep a
</p>
<p>boarding-school. She is no longer fit to be the wife
</p>
<p>of a Virginia gentleman. But there is no need to
</p>
<p>say this. You, Trevor, were your nephew so inclined,
</p>
<p>would never permit the name of your daughter to be
</p>
<p>thus profaned.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I could oppose nothing to it,&quot; said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>&quot; but my displeasure. And though I might not wish
</p>
<p>it, could I have a right to be displeased with Doug
</p>
<p>las for vindicating himself from a charge which has
</p>
<p>grown out of his gallant defence of her? Think of
</p>
<p>the favorable standing of his family ; observe the
</p>
<p>rapid promotion of his brother ; and consider whether

<p>a punctilio of this sort should bind him to renounce

<p>it, said B , &quot; it would not change my opinion.
</p>
<p>124 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>But what prospect is there? Colonel Trevor is per
</p>
<p>haps a favorite at court. So, doubtless, is your brother
</p>
<p>But he is not a man whose fidelity is either to be
</p>
<p>bought or rewarded ; and he and his will be, at any
</p>
<p>moment, postponed and sacrificed to the mercenary,
</p>
<p>who might desert, and even mutiny for want of pay.
</p>
<p>Here is proof of it.
</p>
<p>&quot; Look at the shallow pretext for this proposed
</p>
<p>court-martial. The President is pleased to say that
</p>
<p>he believes your brother ; but that there are those
</p>
<p>who do not. Who are they ? Who can they be ?
</p>
<p>Who is there, worthy to be accounted among his
</p>
<p>advisers, that can disbelieve anything that Hugh
</p>
<p>Trevor shall assert ? Don t you see the cheat ?
</p>
<p>Don t you see that your brother, whose attachment
</p>
<p>to the Union, based as it is on principle, may be
</p>
<p>safely trusted, is to have his feelings wounded to
</p>
<p>gratify the mortified pride of the elder Baker, and
</p>
<p>the skulking malice of his son ? You, Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>know better than I do, who are about the President.
</p>
<p>Is there one among them to whom your father s
</p>
<p>word would need the support of other testimony ?
</p>
<p>Good old man &amp;lt; So little has he of pride or jealousy,
</p>
<p>that this thought never occurs to him. He is modestly
</p>
<p>asking himself what right he has to expect credence
</p>
<p>from those who do not know him. And who are
</p>
<p>these malcontent officers ? Think you there is one

<p>of them who would venture to express his dissatis

<p>&quot; Do look at this letter,&quot; continued B , address

<p>one traversable allegation (as the lawyers say) except

<p>that of his friendship for your brother. Those

<p>they ? Press him, and I dare say some fellow below

<p>it is alleged that these friends have said. His

<p>information is from a source entitled to all confi

</p>
<p>He charges that too on his friends, though it might

<p>not be easy to find a sponsor for that compliment to

<p>old Baker. Since the death of his brother pimp

<p>&quot; It was his own suggestion, and already approved

<p>&quot; That being the case,&quot; said B , &quot; I have only to

<p>say distinctly that the thing admits of no doubt with

</p>
<p>When Douglas s letters were finished, he would
</p>
<p>gladly have put them into Delia s hands before he
</p>
<p>sent them off. But he found, what most men have
</p>
<p>been surprised to find, that after what had passed in
</p>
<p>the morning between him and Delia, it was much
</p>
<p>harder to obtain an interview with her than before.
</p>
<p>When a young gentleman makes a visit of some days
</p>
<p>to a friend in the country, whose daughter suspects
</p>
<p>that he has something to say to her that she is impa

<p>tient to hear, it is amusing to see how many chances
</p>
<p>will bring them together. Each of them is always
</p>
<p>happening to have some call to go where the other
</p>
<p>happens to be ; and, when together, each is apt to be
</p>
<p>detained in the room by some interesting occupation
</p>
<p>until the rest of the company have left it. They are
</p>
<p>continually meeting in passages, and on staircases ;
</p>
<p>and, in pleasant weather, they are almost sure to stroll
</p>
<p>into the garden about the same time. But let the
</p>
<p>decisive word be once spoken, and all is changed.
</p>
<p>Then, bless us, how we blush ! and how we glide
</p>
<p>through half- open doors, and slip away arounc
</p>
<p>corners !
</p>
<p>Still it will happen, as love makes people restless,
</p>
<p>that both will rise early, and so meet in the parlor
</p>
<p>before others are awake. And then there is &quot;the
</p>
<p>dewy eve and rising moon,&quot; and the quiet walk &quot; by
</p>
<p>wimpling burn and leafy shaw ;&quot; but as to a private

</p>
<p>have made no attack on my opinions or allegiam ,

<p>and what was done last night you have had no ageiK /

<p>He now gave her the full history of the affair, and
</p>
<p>succeeded in convincing her that his standard of
</p>
<p>honor was even higher than she had imagined. If
</p>
<p>she requited him for her unjust suspicions with a
</p>
<p>kiss, he never told of it. Perhaps she did. For
</p>
<p>although, according to the refinements of the Yan
</p>
<p>kees, kissing was in very bad taste, yet the northern
</p>
<p>regime had not reached the banks of the Koanokc.
</p>
<p>The ladies there still continued to walk in the steps
</p>
<p>of their chaste mothers safe in that high sense of
</p>
<p>honor which protects at once from pollution and
</p>
<p>suspicion.
</p>
<p>It is true, that when a people become corrupt, they
</p>
<p>must learn to be fastidious, and invent safeguards to
</p>
<p>prevent vice, and blinds to conceal it when it is to be
</p>
<p>indulged. Duennas are necessary in Spain. They
</p>
<p>are at once the guarantee of a lady s honor, and the
</p>
<p>safe instruments of her pleasures. Black eunuchs
</p>
<p>perform the same functions in Turkey. In the north
</p>
<p>ern factories, boys and girls are not permitted to work
</p>
<p>together. In their churches, the gentlemen and ladies
</p>
<p>do not sit in the same pew. What a pitch of refine
</p>
<p>ment ! Sterne s story of the Abbe in the theatre at
</p>
<p>Paris affords the only parallel.

</p>
<p>ON the evening of the third day from that of
</p>
<p>which I have just been speaking, the President of
</p>
<p>the United States was sitting alone in a small room
</p>
<p>in his palace, which, in conformity f o the nomencla
</p>
<p>ture of foreign courts, it had become the fashion to
</p>
<p>call his closet. The furniture of this little apartment
</p>
<p>was characterized at once by neatness, taste, and
</p>
<p>convenience. Without being splendid, it was rich
</p>
<p>and costly ; and, in its structure and arrangement,
</p>
<p>adapted to the use of a man, who, devoted to busi
</p>
<p>ness, yet loved his ease. The weariness of seden
</p>
<p>tary application was relieved by the most tasteful
</p>
<p>and commodious variety of chairs, couches, and sofas,
</p>
<p>while the utmost ingenuity was displayed in the
</p>
<p>construction of desks, tables, and other conveniences
</p>
<p>for reading and writing. In the appearance of the

</p>
<p>distinguished personage, to whose privacy I have
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 133
</p>
<p>introduced the reader, there was a mixture of
</p>
<p>thought and carelessness very much in character
</p>
<p>with the implements of business and the appliances
</p>
<p>for ease and comfort which surrounded him. He
</p>
<p>occasional^ looked at his watch, and at the door,
</p>
<p>with the countenance of one who expects a visitor ;
</p>
<p>and then throwing himself against the arm of his
</p>
<p>sofa, resumed his disengaged air. That something
</p>
<p>was on his mind was apparent. But, interesting
</p>
<p>as the subject might be, it did not seem to touch
</p>
<p>him nearly. His whole manner was that of a man
</p>
<p>who is somewhat at a loss to know what may be best
</p>
<p>for others, but finds full consolation in knowing pre
</p>
<p>cisely what is best for himself.
</p>
<p>As the events of the last , ten years make it pro
</p>
<p>bable that none of my younger readers have ever
</p>
<p>seen the august dignitary of whom I speak, and as
</p>
<p>few of us are like to have occasion to see him in
</p>
<p>future, a particular description of his person may
</p>
<p>not be unacceptable. Though far advanced in life, he
</p>
<p>was tastily and even daintily dressed, his whole cos
</p>
<p>tume being exactly adapted to a diminutive and
</p>
<p>dapper person, a fair complexion, a light and bril
</p>
<p>liant blue eye, and a head which might have formed
</p>
<p>a study for the phrenologist, whether we consider
</p>
<p>its ample developments or its egg-like baldness.
</p>
<p>The place of hair was supplied by powder, which
</p>
<p>his illustrious example had again made fashionable.-

</p>
<p>mencing sixty years ago, had abolished all the privi-
</p>
<p>1 34 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>leges of rank and age ; which trained up the young
</p>
<p>to mock at the infirmities of their fathers, and
</p>
<p>encouraged the unwashed artificer to elbow the
</p>
<p>duke from his place of precedence ; this revolution
</p>
<p>had now completed its cycle. While the sovereignty
</p>
<p>of numbers was acknowledged, the convenience of
</p>
<p>the multitude had set the fashions. But the reign
</p>
<p>of an individual had been restored, arid the taste of
</p>
<p>that individual gave law to the general taste. Had
</p>
<p>he worn a wig, wigs would have been the rage.
</p>
<p>But as phrenology had taught him to be justly
</p>
<p>proud of his high and polished forehead, and the
</p>
<p>intellectual developments of the whole cranium, he
</p>
<p>eschewed hair in all its forms, and barely screened
</p>
<p>his naked crown from the air with a light covering
</p>
<p>of powder. He seemed, too, not wholly unconscious
</p>
<p>of something worthy of admiration in a foot, the
</p>
<p>beauty of which was displayed to the best advan
</p>
<p>tage by the tight fit and high finish of his delicate
</p>
<p>slipper. As he lay back on the sofa, his eye rested
</p>
<p>complacently on this member, which was stretched
</p>
<p>out before him, its position shifting, as if unconsci
</p>
<p>ously, into every variety of grace. Returning from
</p>
<p>thence, his glance rested on his hand, fair, delicate,
</p>
<p>small, and richly jewelled. It hung carelessly on
</p>
<p>the arm of the sofa, and the fingers of this, too, as if
</p>
<p>rather from instinct than volition, performed sun
</p>
<p>dry evolutions on which the eye of majesty dwelt
</p>
<p>with gentle complacency.

</p>
<p>This complacent reverie was frequently broken by
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 135
</p>
<p>the sound of the door-bell. At such moments, the
</p>
<p>President would raise his head with a look of awak
</p>
<p>ened expectation, which subsided instantly; until,
</p>
<p>by frequent repetition, it called up some expression
</p>
<p>of displeased impatience. At last, the sound was
</p>
<p>echoed by a single stroke, which rang from what
</p>
<p>looked like a clock within the room. He immedi
</p>
<p>ately sat erect, assuming an air of dignified and
</p>
<p>complacent composure, suited to the reception of a
</p>
<p>respected visiter.
</p>
<p>The door opened, and the gentleman in waiting
</p>
<p>bowed into the room a person who well deserves a
</p>
<p>particular description, and then withdrew.
</p>
<p>The individual thus introduced was a gentleman
</p>
<p>whose age could not be much short of seventy. In
</p>
<p>person he had probably been once nearly six feet
</p>
<p>high, but time had at once crushed and bowed him
</p>
<p>to a much shorter stature. Indeed, the stoop of his
</p>
<p>shoulders, the protrusion of the neck, arid the pro
</p>
<p>jecting position of the chin, made together that
</p>
<p>peculiar complex curvature which brings the top of
</p>
<p>the cape of the coat exactly against the top of the
</p>
<p>head. The expression of his countenance was, at
</p>
<p>once, fawning and consequential. His face had
</p>
<p>been originally something between round and
</p>
<p>square. It was now shortened by the loss of his
</p>
<p>teeth. The muscular fulness of youth had not
</p>
<p>been replaced by any accession of fat, nor had the
</p>
<p>skin of his face shrunk, as it often does, on the

</p>
<p>retiring flesh. The consequence wa-, that his
</p>
<p>136 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>cheeks hung down in loose pouches, and all his
</p>
<p>features, originally small and mean, seemed in
</p>
<p>volved in the folds of his shrivelled and puckered
</p>
<p>skin. His voice was harsh and grating, and the
</p>
<p>more so from an attempt at suavity in the tones,
</p>
<p>which produced nothing more than a drawling pro
</p>
<p>longation of each word. Thus, though he spoke
</p>
<p>slowly, the stream of sound flowed continually from
</p>
<p>his lips, reminding the hearer of the never-ending
</p>
<p>chant of the locust.
</p>
<p>As the President rose and gracefully advanced to
</p>
<p>welcome him, he shuffled forward as if wishing to
</p>
<p>prevent the honor thus done him, while the increased
</p>
<p>curve of his back and the eager humility of his up
</p>
<p>turned countenance, betokened the prostration of his
</p>
<p>spirit in the presence of the dispenser of honor and
</p>
<p>emolument. Having bowed himself on the hand
</p>
<p>which had been graciously extended to him, he
</p>
<p>remained standing on the floor as if unmindful of
</p>
<p>repeated invitations to be seated. The President had
</p>
<p>not yet so entirely forgotten the manners which once
</p>
<p>distinguished him as a most accomplished gentleman,
</p>
<p>and was not at first aware of the necessity of seating
</p>
<p>himself before his deferential guest. At length, he
</p>
<p>resumed his place on the sofa, and then the other, with
</p>
<p>a new prostration, which seemed to apologize for sit
</p>
<p>ting in the presence of majesty, followed his example.
</p>
<p>lie did not, indeed, presume to share the sofa, though
</p>
<p>invited to do so, but took his place on a seat equally

</p>
<p>luxurious on the opposite side of the fire-place. But
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 137
</p>
<p>the luxury of the chaise tongue was lost on him. He
</p>
<p>felt that to lean against the back or arm would be
</p>
<p>quite unbecoming, and sat as nearly erect as he could,
</p>
<p>in that precise posture which indicates a readiness to
</p>
<p>spring to the feet and do the bidding of a superior.
</p>
<p>&quot; I had begun to despair of seeing you this even
</p>
<p>ing, my dear sir,&quot; said the President, in a tone at once
</p>
<p>kind and reproachful. &quot; I had given orders that I
</p>
<p>should be denied to all but you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You do me great and undeserved honor,&quot; replied
</p>
<p>the other, &quot;but I &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I wished to speak to you in private,&quot; continued
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Buren, not noticing the interruption, &quot; of a
</p>
<p>matter which deeply interests us both. Here is a letter
</p>
<p>which I received this morning, which makes it at least
</p>
<p>doubtful whether the last step which I took in regard
</p>
<p>to that young man, Trevor, is quite such as should
</p>
<p>have been taken.&quot;
</p>
<p>He then took from a bundle of papers, one which
</p>
<p>he read as follows :
</p>
<p>&quot; SIR : I have just learned that charges of a serious
</p>
<p>nature have been made against Lieutenant Trevor,
</p>
<p>which, it seems, grow out of certain occurrences to
</p>
<p>which I am privy. I can have little doubt that the
</p>
<p>affair, to which I allude, has not been truly reported
</p>
<p>to you. Had it been, you would have seen that
</p>
<p>Lieutenant T. acted no otherwise than as became a
</p>
<p>soldier and a gentleman, in whose presence a lady,

<p>under his protection, had been insulted. The enclosed
</p>
<p>138 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>documents, to the authenticity of which I beg leave
</p>
<p>to testify, will place the transaction in its true light.
</p>
<p>Were Lieutenant T. at Washington, I should not lay
</p>
<p>these papers before you, without authority from him.
</p>
<p>As it is. I trust I do no more than my duty by him,
</p>
<p>and by your Excellency, in furnishing such evidences
</p>
<p>of the real facts of the case, as may aid you in decid
</p>
<p>ing on the course to be pursued in regard to it.
</p>
<p>&quot; It may be proper to add, that, having acted as
</p>
<p>Lieutenant T. s friend on the occasion, these docu
</p>
<p>ments were left in my possession in that character. It
</p>
<p>is this same character, in which I feel it especially my
</p>
<p>duty to step forward as the guardian of his honor and
</p>
<p>interests.
</p>
<p>&quot;Hoping that your Excellency will excuse the
</p>
<p>freedom which calls your notice to so humble a
</p>
<p>aame,
</p>
<p>&quot; I have the honor to be,

</p>
<p>Having read this letter aloud, the President, with
</p>
<p>out comment, placed in the hands of his guest a
</p>
<p>bundle of papers. It is only necessary to tell the
</p>
<p>reader that they were copies of the same documents
</p>
<p>which Douglas had laid before his father and uncle,

<p>Lieutenant Whiting.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 139
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Buren now threw himself back upon the
</p>
<p>sofa, and fixed his eye on the face of his companion
</p>
<p>with an expression which betokened some concern,
</p>
<p>not unmixed with a slight enjoyment of the perplexity
</p>
<p>with which the purblind old man pored over the
</p>
<p>papers. Indeed, his uneasiness could hardly have
</p>
<p>escaped the observation of a casual spectator, lie
</p>
<p>shifted his seat ; he read ; then wiped his spectacles,
</p>
<p>and read again ; then wiped his brow ; and having
</p>
<p>gone through all the documents, again took them up
</p>
<p>in order, and read them all over again. When, at
</p>
<p>length, he had extracted all their substance, he turned
</p>
<p>on the President a perplexed and anxious look, and
</p>
<p>remained silent.
</p>
<p>At length, the latter spoke. &quot; I fear we have made
</p>
<p>an unlucky blunder in this business, my dear sir,&quot;
</p>
<p>said he.
</p>
<p>&quot;I fear so too, sir,&quot; said the other. .&quot;But I beg
</p>
<p>leave to assure your Excellency that the information
</p>
<p>I took the liberty to communicate was a simple and
</p>
<p>exact statement of what I learned from my son,
</p>
<p>which, I trust, your Excellency will see is in nowise
</p>
<p>contravened by these documents. I certainly was no.t
</p>
<p>apprised of the provocation which, it is here said,
</p>
<p>was offered to a lady under Lieutenant Trevor s pro
</p>
<p>tection.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Make yourself perfectly easy on that head, my

<p>dear sir,&quot; said the President. &quot; I give myself small

<p>concern on Lieutenant Trevor s account. My obli

</p>
<p>gations to his father are more than discharged by the
</p>
<p>140 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>rapid advancement of his elder brother ; and he can
</p>
<p>have no right to complain that proceedings have been
</p>
<p>instituted to inquire into a matter which, even thus
</p>
<p>explained, places his loyalty in no very favorable
</p>
<p>light. My concern is, lest the prosecution of this
</p>
<p>investigation should lead to results undesirable to
</p>
<p>you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I understand your Excellency,&quot; replied the hono
</p>
<p>rable Mr. Baker. &quot; The object of this communication
</p>
<p>is to convey a covert intimation that, if proceedings
</p>
<p>against Lieutenant Trevor are not stayed, he will re
</p>
<p>venge himself by endeavoring to dishonor my son. I
</p>
<p>never brought him up to be the * butcher of a silk
</p>
<p>button, and don t wonder that his notions of gallan
</p>
<p>try, &c. &c., do not exactly square with those of these
</p>
<p>preux chevaliers&quot;
</p>
<p>11 That view of the subject is doubtless quite philo
</p>
<p>sophical,&quot; said the President ; &quot; and if you regard
</p>
<p>it in that light, it will remove all difficulty out of the
</p>
<p>way.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot exactly say,&quot; replied the other, &quot; that I
</p>
<p>should be quite willing to expose my son to the pain
</p>
<p>of seeing these documents made public ; concocted, as
</p>
<p>they manifestly have been, by men who have learned
</p>
<p>to quarrel by the book, and contrived on purpose to
</p>
<p>shut the door against inquiry. I dare say he would
</p>
<p>hardly have made the communication I received,
</p>
<p>could he have anticipated the step which I deemed
</p>
<p>it my duty to your Excellency to take in conse

</p>
<p>quence of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 141
</p>
<p>&quot; The misfortune is,&quot; replied the President, &quot; that
</p>
<p>I have already caused an intimation to be given to
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Trevor that it may be necessary to order
</p>
<p>a court-martial, unless he thinks proper to demand a
</p>
<p>court of inquiry. Either way, the whole affair must
</p>
<p>come out.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Is there no other alternative 2&quot; asked the anxious
</p>
<p>father. &quot;Could not these papers be suppressed?
</p>
<p>There is no other authentic evidence of these facts.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Unfortunately,&quot; said the President, to whom ha
</p>
<p>bitual intercourse with the base had made the feeling
</p>
<p>&amp;gt;f contempt so familiar that he repressed it without
</p>
<p>difficulty, &quot; unfortunately these papers are but copies.
</p>
<p>The originals are doubtless in the hands of Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Whiting, whose honor cannot be questioned, and pro
</p>
<p>bably they will be farther verified by the handwriting
</p>
<p>of your son.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What then can be done ?&quot; asked the honorable
</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, in a state of unutterable perplexity. Ke-
</p>
<p>ceiving no answer, he sat musing, with the restless
</p>
<p>and fidgeting air of a man who seeks in vain for some
</p>
<p>starting point for his thoughts. He was at length
</p>
<p>roused from his reverie by two strokes of the bell,
</p>
<p>which issued from the clock-case at the President s
</p>
<p>back. The signal was answered by the touch of a
</p>
<p>hand-bell, which stood on a table near him. The door
</p>
<p>opened. The gentleman in waiting entered, advanced
</p>
<p>to the table, laid a packet of letters before the Presi
</p>
<p>dent, and withdrew in silence.

<p>as a whist player runs over his cards, and having fixed

<p>his eye on one, took it out of the parcel, and threw

<p>the rest on the table. His companion having in the

<p>u Here is good news for us, my dear sir,&quot; said he.

<p>&quot; Lieutenant Trevor here tenders his resignation,

<p>which, perhaps, may put an end to the difficulty.&quot;

<p>&quot; Perhaps !&quot; exclaimed the other, eagerly. &quot; There
</p>
<p>can be no doubt about it, I hope.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; None at all ; if his accounts are all adjusted, of
</p>
<p>which I have little doubt. But it is not customary

<p>to let go our hold on an officer by accepting his

<p>resignation, until that matter has been inquired into.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It will be a great relief to me,&quot; faltered out Mr.

</p>
<p>&quot;THERE is something in this business,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>President, after a silence of a few minutes, &quot; which
</p>
<p>I do not well understand. I was not prepared to
</p>
<p>find Lieutenant Trevor so ready to resign, and still
</p>
<p>less to receive his letter of resignation through the
</p>
<p>hands of his father, without one word of expostula

<p>tion to his son, or to me. He does not even intimate

<p>&quot; Hugh Trevor was always a visionary and uncertain

<p>should consider the manifest defection of Lieutenant

<p>always remarkable for his steadiness and fidelity.&quot;

</p>
<p>governed, by principles. But his principles are sc
</p>
<p>numerous, and so hedge him around and beset him on
</p>
<p>every side, that they have kept him standing still the
</p>
<p>greater part of his life. When he moves, it would
</p>
<p>take an expert mathematician to calculate the result
</p>
<p>of all the compound forces which act upon him, and
</p>
<p>to decide certainly what course he might take.&quot;
</p>
<p>u llow happens it, then,&quot; asked the President,
</p>
<p>&quot; that I have always found him so loyal and faithful
</p>
<p>in his devotion to me ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Because he identified your Excellency in his own
</p>
<p>mind with the Union, to which he is determined to sacri
</p>
<p>fice every thing else. But now that disunion has come,
</p>
<p>and the question is ivhether Virginia shall adhere to the
</p>
<p>North or join the South, he has a new problem to work,
</p>
<p>and how he may work it, no man can anticipate. Hence
</p>
<p>I say he is uncertain.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But does he think nothing of the advancement of
</p>
<p>his family?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It seems not, in this instance. That is what I
</p>
<p>meant when I said that his principles were too many.
</p>
<p>Your Excellency knows,&quot; continued the honorable
</p>
<p>gentleman, with a contortion of the mouth meant for
</p>
<p>A smile, and which, but for the loss of his teeth, might
</p>
<p>have produced a grin, &quot; that the cardinal number of

</p>
<p>&quot; None,&quot; replied Baker ; &quot; I do but speak from my
</p>
<p>knowledge of the man. I do not think him capable
</p>
<p>of that gratitude for the many favors he and his family
</p>
<p>have received which should bind him indissolubly to
</p>
<p>your Excellency s service.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It is well, at least,&quot; said the President, &quot; that one
</p>
<p>of his sons, on whom most of those favors have been
</p>
<p>lavished, is made of different materials. The princi
</p>
<p>ples of Colonel Trevor are exactly of the right sort ;
</p>
<p>or, as you would say, my dear sir, they are of just the
</p>
<p>right number. Could I obtain any information of the
</p>
<p>father s movements, which might give me just cause
</p>
<p>to doubt him, I would take occasion to show the dif
</p>
<p>ference I make between the faithful and the unstable.
</p>
<p>I would refuse to receive this young man s resigna
</p>
<p>tion, and order a court-martial immediately. I mis
</p>
<p>take if the father would not be glad to extricate him
</p>
<p>from the difficulty, by renouncing some of these fan
</p>
<p>tastic notions which he dignifies by the name of prin
</p>
<p>ciples.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I beseech your Excellency,&quot; said Baker, forget
</p>
<p>ting his envious spleen against the virtuous and up
</p>
<p>right friend of his early youth, in his alarm at the
</p>
<p>mention of the court-martial ; &quot; I beseech your
</p>
<p>Excellency not to understand me as preferring any
</p>
<p>charge against Mr. Hugh Trevor. He is an excellent
</p>
<p>man, who well deserves all the favors he has received,
</p>
<p>and will, doubtless, merit many more. I pray that
</p>
<p>what I have said may not at all influence you to any
</p>
<p>harsh measures against him or his.&quot;

<p>146 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>The tact of the President at once detected the
</p>
<p>revulsion of Baker s feelings, and the cause. Indeed,
</p>
<p>he well knew both the men. He was aware that all
</p>
<p>that had been said of Mr. Trevor was essentially true.
</p>
<p>He had, therefore, the more highly prized his friend
</p>
<p>ship, as one of the brightest jewels in his crown.
</p>
<p>He had taught his advocates and minions to point to
</p>
<p>him as one, whose support it was known would not
</p>
<p>be given to any man but from a sense of duty. He
</p>
<p>was himself not so dead to virtue as not to respect it
</p>
<p>in another ; and his favorable dispositions toward Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, and the benefits bestowed on his family, had
</p>
<p>more of respect and gratitude than commonly mingled
</p>
<p>in his feelings or actions. Of Baker, he had rightly
</p>
<p>formed a different estimate. He found him in the
</p>
<p>shambles, and had bought and used him. To Baker,
</p>
<p>too, Mr. Trevor appeared only as one, in whose life
</p>
<p>there was a &quot;daily beauty that made his ugly;&quot; and he
</p>
<p>had seen, with malignant envy, the honors and emolu
</p>
<p>ments for which he had toiled through all the drudgery
</p>
<p>of a partisan, freely bestowed on the unasking and
</p>
<p>unpretending merit of a rival. Gladly would he have
</p>
<p>improved the distrust, which he saw had entered into
</p>
<p>the mind of the President, had he not been warned
</p>
<p>that the first effect of it might be to press an inquiry
</p>
<p>which must eventuate in the irreparable dishonor of
</p>
<p>his own son.
</p>
<p>While he sat meditating on these things, and sub

<p>bell sounded ; the single stroke from the clock-case
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 147
</p>
<p>echoed the sound ; the door opened ; and a new cha
</p>
<p>racter appeared on the stage.
</p>
<p>No person whose name appears in this history bet
</p>
<p>ter deserves a particular description than he who now
</p>
<p>entered. Fortunately I am saved the necessity of
</p>
<p>going into it, by having it in my power to refer the
</p>
<p>reader to a most graphic delineation of his exact pro
</p>
<p>totype in person, mind, manners, and principles.
</p>
<p>In Oliver Dain, or Oliver le Diable, as he was
</p>
<p>called, the favorite instrument of the crimes of that
</p>
<p>remorseless tyrant Louis XL, he had found his great
</p>
<p>exemplar. The picture of that worthy, as drawn
</p>
<p>by Sir Walter Scott, in Quentin Durward, is the
</p>
<p>most exact likeness of one man ever taken for
</p>
<p>another. It is not even worth while to change the
</p>
<p>costume ; for although he did not appear with a bar
</p>
<p>ber s apron girded around his waist, and the basin
</p>
<p>in his hands, it was impossible to look upon him
</p>
<p>without seeing that his undoubted talents, and the
</p>
<p>high stations he had filled, still left him fit to be
</p>
<p>employed in the most abject and menial services.
</p>
<p>This happy compound of meanness, malignity,
</p>
<p>treachery, and talent, was welcomed by the Presi
</p>
<p>dent with a nod and smile at once careless and
</p>
<p>gracious. At the sight of him, Mr. Baker made
</p>
<p>haste to rise, and bustled forward to meet and salute
</p>
<p>him with an air, in which, if there was less of ser
</p>
<p>vility, there was more of the eagerness of adulation
</p>
<p>than he had displayed toward the President himself.

<p>The earnest inquiries of Mr. Baker after his health
</p>
<p>148 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&c., &c., were answered with the fawning air of one
</p>
<p>who feels himself much obliged by the notice of a
</p>
<p>superior, and he then turned to the President as if
</p>
<p>waiting his commands. These were communicated
</p>
<p>by putting into his hands the letters of Mr. Hugh
</p>
<p>Trevor and his son, which he was requested to read.
</p>
<p>While he read, the President, turning to Mr. Baker,
</p>
<p>said : &quot; While I thought of ordering a court-martial
</p>
<p>on the case of Lieutenant Trevor, I deemed it advis
</p>
<p>able to have all his military transactions looked into,
</p>
<p>intending, if any thing were amiss, to make it the
</p>
<p>subject of a distinct charge.&quot; Then, turning to the
</p>
<p>other, he added : &quot; You have, I presume, acquainted
</p>
<p>vourself with the state of the young man s accounts.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have, sir,&quot; was the reply. &quot; They have been
</p>
<p>all settled punctually.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Then there is nothing to prevent the acceptance
</p>
<p>of his resignation ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Nothing of that sort, certainly, sir. But has
</p>
<p>your Excellency observed the date of this letter of
</p>
<p>his ? You may see that he does not date from his
</p>
<p>father s house. I happen to know this place, Truro,
</p>
<p>to be the residence of that pestilent traitor, his uncle.
</p>
<p>Now, if the charge be well founded, I submit to
</p>
<p>your Excellency whether the offender should be per
</p>
<p>mitted to escape prosecution by resigning. If it be
</p>
<p>not exactly capable of being substantiated, yet his
</p>
<p>readiness to resign on so slight an intimation ren
</p>
<p>ders his disaffection at least probable, and his date

</p>
<p>renders it nearly certain. Might it not then be
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 149
</p>
<p>advisable to retain the hold we have upon him?
</p>
<p>The court-martial being once ordered, additional
</p>
<p>charges might be preferred ; and I much mistake
</p>
<p>the temper of the country where he is, if he does
</p>
<p>not furnish matter for additional charges before the
</p>
<p>month of April passes by.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Why the month of April ?&quot; asked the Presi
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>&quot; Because then the elections come on ; and there
</p>
<p>is little doubt that exertions will be made to obtain
</p>
<p>a majority in the Legislature of men disposed to
</p>
<p>secede, and join the southern confederacy. In that
</p>
<p>county, in particular, I am well advised that such
</p>
<p>exertions will be made. A hen-hearted fellow has
</p>
<p>been put forward as the candidate of the malcon
</p>
<p>tents, who can be easily driven from the canvass by
</p>
<p>his personal fears. Let the aifair once take that
</p>
<p>shape, and immediately the fantastic notions of what
</p>
<p>southern men call chivalry, which infest the brain
</p>
<p>of this old drawcansir, will push him forward as a
</p>
<p>candidate. I had made some arrangements which,
</p>
<p>with your Excellency s approbation, I had proposed
</p>
<p>to carry into effect for accomplishing this result, in
</p>
<p>the hope of bringing him into collision with the law
</p>
<p>of treason, and so getting rid at once of a dangerous
</p>
<p>enemy. Now, if this young man s resignation be
</p>
<p>rejected, and a court-martial be ordered, the part he
</p>
<p>will act in the affair can hardly fail to be such as to
</p>
<p>make his a ball-cartridge case.&quot;

<p>&quot; Your plan is exceedingly well aimed,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>150 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>President, &quot; but on farther reflection, my good
</p>
<p>friend Mr. Baker is led by feelings of delicacy to
</p>
<p>wish to withdraw his charges. I am loth to deny
</p>
<p>any thing to one who merits so much at my hands,
</p>
<p>but still there are difficulties in the way which will
</p>
<p>not permit us to pursue that course. The acceptance
</p>
<p>of this resignation will effectually remove them, and
</p>
<p>indirectly gratify the wish of Mr. Baker. Now,
</p>
<p>what do you advise ?&quot;
</p>
<p>In the act of asking this question, the President
</p>
<p>shifted his position so suddenly as to call the
</p>
<p>minion s attention to the motion. lie looked up
</p>
<p>and saw his master s face averted from Mr. Baker,
</p>
<p>and thought he read there an intimation that he
</p>
<p>should press his former objection. This he therefore
</p>
<p>did, expressing his reluctance to give advice unfavor
</p>
<p>able to the wishes of one so much respected as Mr.
</p>
<p>Baker, and highly complimenting the delicacy of his
</p>
<p>scruples.
</p>
<p>&quot; But suppose,&quot; asked the President, &quot; we press
</p>
<p>the passage of the law authorizing a court to sit
</p>
<p>here for the trial, by a jury of this District, of
</p>
<p>offences committed in Yirginia. In that case,
</p>
<p>should our young cock crow too loud, we might find
</p>
<p>means to cut his comb without a court-martial.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That Congress will pass such a law cannot be
</p>
<p>doubted,&quot; said the other,&quot; were it not vain to do so,
</p>
<p>when it seems to be understood that none of the

<p>judges would be willing to execute it. I am tired

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 151
</p>
<p>&quot; I am bound to respect them,&quot; replied the Presi
</p>
<p>dent, meekly. &quot; But I really do not see the grounds
</p>
<p>for them in such a case as this. I beg pardon,
</p>
<p>Judge Baker. I know it is against rule to ask a
</p>
<p>judge s opinion out of court. But I beg you to
</p>
<p>enlighten me so far as to explain to me what are the
</p>
<p>scruples which the bench are supposed to feel on this
</p>
<p>subject. I make the inquiry, because I am anxious
</p>
<p>to accept this young fellow s resignation, if, in doing
</p>
<p>so, I shall not lose the means of punishing the
</p>
<p>offences which there is too much reason to think he
</p>
<p>meditates. To try him in Virginia would be vain.
</p>
<p>Indeed, I doubt whether your court could sit there
</p>
<p>in safety.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I fear it could not,&quot; replied the Judge, &quot; and
</p>
<p>have therefore no difficulty in saying, that the neces
</p>
<p>sity of the case should overrule all constitutional
</p>
<p>scruples. I have no delicacy in answering your
</p>
<p>Excellency s question out of court. It is merely an
</p>
<p>inquiry, which I hope is superfluous, whether I
</p>
<p>would do my duty. I trust it is not doubted that I
</p>
<p>would ; and should I be honored with your Excel
</p>
<p>lency s commands in that behalf, I should hold
</p>
<p>myself bound to execute them. To speak more
</p>
<p>precisely : should the court be established, and ]
</p>
<p>appointed to preside in it, I should cheerfully do
</p>
<p>so.&quot;

</p>
<p>Some desultory conversation now arose on various
</p>
<p>topics, more and more remote from public affairs.
</p>
<p>On these Mr. Baker would have been glad to des

<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>As the door closed behind him, the countenance
</p>
<p>of the President relaxed into a smile, indicative of
</p>
<p>great satisfaction and self-applause, along with an
</p>
<p>uncontrollable disposition to merriment. The smile
</p>
<p>soon became a quiet laugh, which increased in
</p>
<p>violence without ever becoming loud, until he lay
</p>
<p>back against the arm of the sofa, and covered his
</p>
<p>face with his handkerchief. At length, his mirth
</p>
<p>exhausted itself, and he sat erect, looking at the
</p>
<p>Minister with the countenance of one about to make
</p>
<p>some amusing communication. But he waited to be
</p>
<p>spoken to, and remained silent. His minion took
</p>
<p>the hint, and addressing himself to what he supposed

<p>-Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; How can you ask such a question ?&quot; said the
</p>
<p>President, with mock gravity. &quot;Did you not hear
</p>
<p>the elaborate and lucid argument by which the
</p>
<p>Judge proved incontestably that it could not be
</p>
<p>unconstitutional to do his duty ? The wonder is how
</p>
<p>they ever contrived to make a difficulty. Surely
</p>
<p>none who shall ever hear that demonstration can
</p>
<p>doubt again.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But may I be permitted to ask by what means
</p>
<p>such a flood of light has been poured upon his mind ?
</p>
<p>But yesterday he was dark as the moon in its peri
</p>
<p>helion. Has the golden ray of additional favors
</p>
<p>again caused its face to shine ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; No,&quot; said the President.
</p>
<p>&quot; No new emoluments to him or his ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; None at all,&quot; was the laughing answer.
</p>
<p>&quot; No new honors ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; None ; but the honor of doing additional duty,
</p>
<p>for the first time in his life, without additional com
</p>
<p>pensation.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; In the name of witchcraft, then, what has
</p>
<p>wrought upon him ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That I shall not tell you,&quot; said the President,
</p>
<p>still laughing. &quot; That is my secret. That part of
</p>
<p>my arc you shall never know. It is one of the jokes
</p>
<p>that a man enjoys the better for having it all to him
</p>
<p>self. I keep it for my own diversion. It is a sort
</p>
<p>of royal game. You, 1 am sure, may be satisfied
</p>
<p>with your share in the sport, having been admitted

</p>
<p>to hear that argument. It was a lesson in dialectics
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 155
</p>
<p>worth a course at a German university. But come !
</p>
<p>There is a time to laugh, and a time to be serious.
</p>
<p>What do you propose on the subject of these Vir
</p>
<p>ginia elections ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I propose,&quot; said the Minister, &quot; to distribute
</p>
<p>some five hundred men in certain counties, with the
</p>
<p>dispositions of which I have made myself acquainted,
</p>
<p>to preserve order at the elections, as we should say
</p>
<p>to the uninitiated ; but in plain English, to control
</p>
<p>them. They will succeed in this, or provoke vio
</p>
<p>lence. Either way, we carry our point. We pre
</p>
<p>vail in the elections, or we involve the members elect
</p>
<p>in a charge of treason. I think we may trust Judge
</p>
<p>Baker for the rest. The more dangerous of our ene
</p>
<p>mies will thus fall under the edge of the law, and
</p>
<p>the less efficient, if not left in a minority, will be
</p>
<p>powerless for want of leaders.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But the scene of action,&quot; said the President, &quot; is
</p>
<p>close to the line. The offenders may escape into
</p>
<p>North Carolina, and from thence keep up a commu
</p>
<p>nication with their friends. They may even ven
</p>
<p>ture to Richmond at a critical moment, and effect
</p>
<p>their great purpose, or they may adjourn to some
</p>
<p>place of greater security.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It will certainly be necessary,&quot; said the Minister,
</p>
<p>&quot;to -guard against that, by increasing the number of
</p>
<p>troops at the seat of government. Besides, if we can but
</p>
<p>get one day to ourselves, their chance of legislative
</p>
<p>action may be broken up by adjournment sine die&quot;

<p>&quot; Then, with so many points in the game in OUT

</p>
<p>favor,&quot; replied the President, &quot; we have hut to play
</p>
<p>it boldly and we must win. It shall go hard, too,
</p>
<p>if, in the end, we do not make this superfluous State
</p>
<p>Legislature, this absurd relic of vmperium in
</p>
<p>im/periO) abolish itself. At all events, the course of
</p>
<p>conduct which they will necessarily pursue, must
</p>
<p>sink the body in public estimation, and dispose the
</p>
<p>people to acquiesce in the union of all power in the
</p>
<p>hands of the Central Government. We can then
</p>
<p>restore them all the benefits of real and efficient
</p>
<p>local legislation, by erecting these degraded sove
</p>
<p>reignties into what they ought always to have been
</p>
<p>municipal corporations, exercising such powers as
</p>
<p>we choose to grant.&quot;
</p>
<p>Some farther conversation ensued, in which details
</p>
<p>were settled. A minute was made of the points at
</p>
<p>which troops should be stationed ; the number of
</p>
<p>men to be placed at each ; and the corps from which
</p>
<p>they were to be drawn. It was left to the Minister
</p>
<p>to fix on proper persons to command each party, and
</p>
<p>to devise instructions as to the part to be acted. In
</p>
<p>some places it was proposed simply to awe the elec
</p>
<p>tions b^ the mere presence of the military. In some,
</p>
<p>to control them by actual or threatened violence.
</p>
<p>In others, insult was to be used, tumult excited,
</p>
<p>resistance provoked, and dangerous men drawn in,
</p>
<p>to commit acts which might be denounced as
</p>
<p>criminal. Having thus possessed himself of his
</p>
<p>master s will, this modern Sejanus withdrew to give

</p>
<p>necessary orders for effecting it
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 157
</p>
<p>&quot; The only truly wise man that I know in the
</p>
<p>world,&quot; said the President, looking after him. &quot; The
</p>
<p>only one who knows man as he is ; who takes no
</p>
<p>account of human virtue, but as one form of human
</p>
<p>weakness. In his enemies, it gives him a power
</p>
<p>over them which he always knows how to use. In
</p>
<p>his instruments, he desires none of it. Why cannot
</p>
<p>I profit more by his instruction and example? Fool
</p>
<p>that I am ! I will try to practise a lesson.&quot;
</p>
<p>He rang the bell, and directed that the Minister
</p>
<p>should be requested to return.
</p>
<p>He had not yet left the palace, and soon re-ap
</p>
<p>peared. As he entered, the President said : &quot; This
</p>
<p>young Trevor ! He has talent, has he not ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Talent of every kind,&quot; said the Minister.
</p>
<p>&quot;That he has a superabundance of what fools call
</p>
<p>honor and gallantry, I happen to know. I suppose
</p>
<p>his other virtues are in proportion ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I suspect so, from the example of the father, and
</p>
<p>all I can learn of the son.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Can you then doubt of his ultimate course ? or
</p>
<p>even that of his father? Do you doubt that if the
</p>
<p>standard of rebellion is once raised, the young man
</p>
<p>will be found fighting under it, with the old man s
</p>
<p>approbation ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Not at all. I know no man who would raise it
</p>
<p>sooner than himself, after he has had time to be
</p>
<p>thoroughly indoctrinated by his uncle.&quot;

<p>rel yet. What if he can be brought to commit
</p>
<p>158 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>himself before his spurs have acquired their full
</p>
<p>length?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing could be more judicious, and nothing
</p>
<p>easier.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How would you go about it ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Let him have a letter neither accepting nor
</p>
<p>rejecting. Intimating the necessity of farther inves
</p>
<p>tigation of his accounts, &c., &c., before we let him
</p>
<p>off, and requiring him, for the convenience of farther
</p>
<p>correspondence, to remain at the place from whence
</p>
<p>his letter is dated. Keep him fretted in this until
</p>
<p>the election is near at hand, and, a day or two
</p>
<p>before, let him receive a letter accepting his resig
</p>
<p>nation. My life upon it, he will spring to his
</p>
<p>destruction like a bow, when the string is cut, that
</p>
<p>snaps by its own violence.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You are right,&quot; said the President. &quot; That will
</p>
<p>do. Much will depend on the style of that letter.
</p>
<p>You have your hands too full to be troubled with
</p>
<p>such things, or I should ask you to do what no man
</p>
<p>can do so well. But you have your pupils, who
</p>
<p>have learned of you to say what is to be said, so as
</p>
<p>just to produce the desired effect, and no other.&quot;
</p>
<p>The instrument of the royal pleasure again with
</p>
<p>drew. Again the President looked after him, and
</p>
<p>said, musingly: &quot;Were I not myself, I would be
</p>
<p>that man. I should even owe him a higher compli
</p>
<p>ment could one be devised, for, but for him, I had
</p>
<p>never been what I am. What then? Is he the

<p>creator, arid am I his creature? No. I am wrong
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>Could he have made himself what I am, he would
</p>
<p>have done so. He has but fulfilled my destiny, and
</p>
<p>I his. He has made me what I alone was capable
</p>
<p>of becoming, and I, in turn, have made him all that
</p>
<p>he ever can be. I owe him nothing, therefore ; and
</p>
<p>should he ever be guilty of any thing like virtue,
</p>
<p>there is nothing to hinder me from lopping off any
</p>
<p>such superfluous excrescence, even if his head should
</p>
<p>go with it. But he is in no danger on that score.
</p>
<p>If he held his life by no other tenure, his immortality
</p>
<p>would be sure.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;While the master thus soliloquized, the minion
</p>
<p>was wending his way home, to the performance of
</p>
<p>the various duties assigned him. Our present busi

<p>CHAPTEE XVIII.
</p>
<p>Behold the tools,
</p>
<p>The broken tools that tyrants cast away
</p>
<p>By myriads. BYRON.
</p>
<p>BEHOLD us then, once more, at the door of Mr.
</p>
<p>Bernard Trevor s little study. The uncle and ne
</p>
<p>phew are together. A servant enters with letters
</p>
<p>from the post-office, and we enter with him. The

<p>letters are opened, and Douglas having read that

<p>of the Secretary of War, hands it to his uncle. Let

<p>us read with him.
</p>
<p>&quot; SIR : I have it in command from his Excellency
</p>
<p>the President to say, that your letter of resignation
</p>
<p>has been received with surprise and regret.
</p>
<p>&quot; He lias seen with surprise that, at a moment of
</p>
<p>such critical importance, one who had been, as it
</p>
<p>were, the foster-child of the Union, should seize, with
</p>
<p>apparent eagerness, a pretext to desert the banner of
</p>
<p>his too partial sovereign.
</p>
<p>&quot; His regret is not at the loss of service, which,
</p>
<p>rendered by one capable even of meditating such a
</p>
<p>step, would, at best, be merely nominal ; bat at the
</p>
<p>thought that that one is the son of a friend so long

</p>
<p>cheribhed and so much respected as your father.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 161
</p>
<p>&quot; I am farther charged to remind you, that resig
</p>
<p>nation, when resorted to for the purpose of evading
</p>
<p>military prosecution, is always deemed little short
</p>
<p>of a confession of guilt. In most cases, this pro
</p>
<p>duces no embarrassment. The loss of the commis
</p>
<p>sion is generally an adequate punishment ; and it is,
</p>
<p>in such cases, well to leave the conscience and the
</p>
<p>fears of the accused to inflict that punishment, rati
</p>
<p>fying the sentence by prompt acceptance of the
</p>
<p>proffered resignation.
</p>
<p>&quot; But this does not hold in all cases. The Presi
</p>
<p>dent bids me say that he is not yet prepared how to
</p>
<p>act in one of so serious a character as this. His
</p>
<p>regard for your father is the source of this per
</p>
<p>plexity. He requires time to reflect how far he can
</p>
<p>reconcile to his public duty that tenderness to the
</p>
<p>feelings of a friend which makes him desirous, if
</p>
<p>possible, to stay inquiry by accepting your resigna
</p>
<p>tion. Under other circumstances, he would not
</p>
<p>hesitate to reject it, and instantly order a court-
</p>
<p>martial, as the proper means of bringing to prompt
</p>
<p>and merited punishment an offence which, I am
</p>
<p>charged to say, he considers as virtually admitted
</p>
<p>by your attempt to evade a trial ; when, if innocent,
</p>
<p>you would certainly wish an investigation, in order
</p>
<p>to establish your innocence.
</p>
<p>&quot; In conclusion, I am instructed to say, that for
</p>
<p>the purpose of further communication, if necessary,

<p>and to facilitate such measures as it may be deemed

<p>162 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>keep myself advised of your locality. To save
</p>
<p>trouble, therefore, I deem it advisable to command
</p>
<p>you to remain at the place from whence your letter
</p>
<p>of resignation was dated, and to which this is
</p>
<p>directed, until farther orders.
</p>
<p>&quot; Yours, &c., &c.
</p>
<p>(&quot; By order of the President.&quot;)
</p>
<p>This letter Mr. Trevor read with calm and quiet
</p>
<p>attention, carefully weighing every phrase and word,
</p>
<p>while Douglas, perceiving the handwriting of his
</p>
<p>friend Whiting on the back of another, hastily tore
</p>
<p>it open, and read as follows :
</p>
<p>&quot; I never performed a more painful duty in my
</p>
<p>life, my dear Trevor, than in putting the seal and
</p>
<p>superscription to the accompanying letter from the
</p>
<p>Secretary.
</p>
<p>&quot; My situation in the Department should have
</p>
<p>given me earlier notice of what was passing, but I
</p>
<p>got no hint of it until yesterday. I immediately
</p>
<p>did what I believed to be my duty as a friend ;
</p>
<p>though 1 am now fearful that what I did may not
</p>
<p>meet your entire approbation. I am sensible you
</p>
<p>would not have done it for yourself; but there are
</p>
<p>some things which delicacy forbids us to do in our
</p>
<p>own case, which we are not displeased to have done
</p>
<p>by others. Indeed, had I known that the matter
</p>
<p>had gone so far, I should have left it in your own
</p>
<p>hands. But I had no reason to believe that any

</p>
<p>intimation of it had, as yet, been given to you, and
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 163
</p>
<p>I wished to prevent any step whatever from being
</p>
<p>taken.
</p>
<p>&quot; With this view I ventured to lay the whole
</p>
<p>correspondence before the President. I know that
</p>
<p>he received and read it. You will therefore judge
</p>
<p>my surprise at being required, to-day, to forward
</p>
<p>the unprecedented document which accompanies
</p>
<p>this.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am guilty of no breach of duty when I assure
</p>
<p>you that that paper is sent, as it imports on its face,
</p>
<p>by the order of the President. The Secretary is
</p>
<p>not responsible even for one word of it. The very
</p>
<p>handwriting is unknown to me, and it was sent to
</p>
<p>the department precisely in the shape in which you
</p>
<p>receive it.
</p>
<p>&quot; Knowing what I did, I should have doubted
</p>
<p>whether it had not been surreptitiously placed
</p>
<p>among other papers transmitted to us at the same
</p>
<p>time. But there is no room for mistake. It came
</p>
<p>accompanied by the most authentic evidence that
</p>
<p>it had been read and approved by the President
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>&quot; I find myself placed in a delicate situation.
</p>
<p>Here is an avowal of full faith in a charge disproved
</p>
<p>by my positive assurance : a charge that no one can
</p>
<p>believe, who does not believe me capable of basely
</p>
<p>fabricating the documents, copies of which the Pre
</p>
<p>sident has, authenticated under my hand.

</p>
<p>would advise me to do, under such circumstances
</p>
<p>164 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>But my lot in life is different from yours. Impatient
</p>
<p>as I am of this indignity, I fear I shall be constrained
</p>
<p>to bear it. c My poverty but not my will consents.
</p>
<p>I do not, therefore, ask you to advise me, for I would
</p>
<p>not do so, unless prepared to give to your advice
</p>
<p>more weight than I can allow it. It could add
</p>
<p>nothing to the convictions of my own mind, and the
</p>
<p>indignant writhings of my own wounded honor ; and
</p>
<p>even these, God help me, I am forced to resist !
</p>
<p>&quot; This affair has, as yet, made no noise. It is
</p>
<p>not at all known of in the army ; but I think I can
</p>
<p>assure you of the sympathy of all whose regard you
</p>
<p>value, and their unabated confidence in your honor
</p>
<p>and fidelity. I shall make it my business, be the
</p>
<p>consequence to myself what it may, to do you ample
</p>
<p>justice. Indeed, my indignation makes me so reck
</p>
<p>less of consequences, that, apart from the necessity
</p>
<p>of bearing insult from one from whom no redress
</p>
<p>can be demanded, I am not sure that I do not envy
</p>
<p>your lot.
</p>
<p>&quot; That your resignation will eventually be ac
</p>
<p>cepted, cannot be doubted. What is the motive to
</p>
<p>this letter, it is hard to say ; but certainly it does
</p>
<p>not proceed from such a disposition as would wil
</p>
<p>lingly afford you an opportunity of triumphant
</p>
<p>vindication.

</p>
<p>Having read this second letter, Douglas passed it
</p>
<p>also to his uncle, and, rising, hastily left the house.
</p>
<p>It is needless to scan the thoughts that accompanied
</p>
<p>him in his ramble. They were bitter and fierce
</p>
<p>enough. But he had learned, in early life, to master
</p>
<p>his feelings, and never to venture into the presence
</p>

<p>IT was settled, on consultation, that he should
</p>
<p>abide the final event ; and that, until then, nothing
</p>
<p>of what had passed should be made known to his
</p>
<p>father, to Delia, or to any of the family but Mrs.
</p>
<p>Trevor. In her he had learned to seek an adviser,
</p>
<p>and in her he always found one sincere, sagacious,
</p>
<p>and discreet. Mr. Trevor, as I have said, was not a
</p>
<p>man from whose opinions his wife would probably
</p>
<p>dissent, but he had not contented himself to com
</p>
<p>mand her blind, unreasoning acquiescence. He had
</p>
<p>trained her mind ; he had furnished her with mate

<p>rials for thought ; and he had taught her to think.
</p>
<p>She was in all his confidence, and he consulted with
</p>
<p>her habitually on plans which involved the welfare
</p>
<p>of his country. From her, therefore, the history of
</p>
<p>Douglas s entanglement with the authorities at

<p>the family it was a profound secret ; and. as Mr.

</p>
<p>i68 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>invited them to seek amusement out of doors. By
</p>
<p>means of this, the impatience of Douglas was di
</p>
<p>verted, and he found it quite easy to accomplish his
</p>
<p>philosophical determination to wait the result of the
</p>
<p>affair in patience.
</p>
<p>When, at length, a week had been allowed him to
</p>
<p>fret his heart out, the deferred acceptance of his
</p>
<p>resignation was received. This, too, was couched in
</p>
<p>phrases of decorous and studied insult. But he had
</p>
<p>learned to think that the dastard blow struck by one
</p>
<p>who screens himself behind the authority of office,
</p>
<p>inflicts no dishonor. The interval, which had been
</p>
<p>intended to give his passions time to work them
</p>
<p>selves into a tempest, had subdued them. Reason
</p>
<p>had taken the ascendant, and though his reflections
</p>
<p>had not been much more favorable to the authority
</p>
<p>of his former master, than tlie promptings of his
</p>
<p>resentment, they were much less suited to his pre
</p>
<p>sent purpose. He was effectually weaned ; divested
</p>
<p>of all former prepossessions, and ready to yield to
</p>
<p>the dictates of calm, unbiassed reason. He sought
</p>
<p>his uncle, and with a quiet and cheerful smile, handed
</p>
<p>him the letter.
</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Trevor read it, he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>4 Thank God ! you are now a freeman.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I am truly thankful for it,&quot; replied Douglas,
</p>
<p>&quot; though I feel as if I shall never lose the mark of

<p>tho collar which reminds me that I have been a
</p>
<p>slave. But, until within a short time past, I have

</p>
<p>&quot; &quot;When the bondage reaches to the mind,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor, it is not felt.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And was mine enslaved,&quot; asked Douglas, &quot; when
</p>
<p>my thoughts were as free as air ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Their prison was airy,&quot; replied the old gentle
</p>
<p>man, &quot; and roomy, and splendidly fitted up. But
</p>
<p>look at the President s letters, and see the penalties
</p>
<p>you might have incurred, had your freedom of
</p>
<p>thought rambled into such opinions as many of your
</p>
<p>best friends entertain.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Still,&quot; replied Douglas, &quot; the penalty would have
</p>
<p>attached, not to the opinion, but to the expression
</p>
<p>of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And do you think your mind would work without
</p>
<p>constraint, in deciding between opinions which it
</p>
<p>might be unsafe to express, and those which would
</p>
<p>be regarded as meritorious !&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I can, at least, assure you that such a thought
</p>
<p>as that never occurred to me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But it occurred to your friends. It tied my

<p>tongue, and, I suspect, your father s too, of late.
</p>
<p>Now that I am free to speak, let me ask, wherein
</p>
<p>would have been the criminality of expressing the

<p>opinions imputed to you? &quot;

<p>&quot; And what if your mews of the constitution had
</p>
<p>shown you that the acts of the Government were vio
</p>
<p>lations of the constitution, and that the men de
</p>
<p>nounced by Baker as traitors were its most steady
</p>
<p>supporters. What duty would your oath have pre

<p>scribed in that case ? Would you support the con

<p>stitution by taking part with those who trampled it
</p>
<p>under foot, against those who upheld it as long as
</p>
<p>there was hope? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I should have distrusted my own judgment.
</p>
<p>Surely, you would not have me set up that against
</p>
<p>the opinions of the legislative, executive, and judi

<p>ciary, all concurrently expressed according to the

<p>forms of the constitution.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; &quot;What then must / do ? &quot; asked Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>&quot; Be the opinions of all these men what they may,

<p>the constitution, after all, is what it is. As such, I

<p>am bound to support it. Now, when I have schooled

<p>myself into all possible respect for their judgment,

<p>and all possible diffidence of my own, if I still think

<p>that they are clearly in error, is it ~by conforming to

<p>case, conform to your own convictions.&quot;

<p>&quot; And you,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; who were not free
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 171
</p>
<p>to do so who, in the matter of an oath, were to ho
</p>
<p>guided, not by your own conscience, hut by the con
</p>
<p>sciences of other men was your mind free ? &quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas colored high, and, after a long pause,
</p>
<p>said : &quot; I see that I have been swinging in a gilded
</p>
<p>cage, and mistook its motions for those of my own
</p>
<p>will. I see it, and again respond cordially to your
</p>
<p>ejaculation : Thank God ! I am free.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I rejoice at it, especially,&quot; said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>&quot; because now all reserve is at an end between us.
</p>
<p>Heretofore, in all my intercourse with you, my
</p>
<p>tongue has been tied on the subject of which I think
</p>
<p>most, and on which I feel most deeply. I find it
</p>
<p>hard to speak to a son of Virginia without speaking
</p>
<p>of her wrongs, and the means of redressing them. It
</p>
<p>is harder still, when he to whom 1 speak is my own

<p>sion to the exercise of powers not granted ly the con

</p>
<p>oppression, he taught me to hear it sooner than incur

<p>the evils of disunion.&quot;
</p>
<p>What are they ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Weakness, dissention, and the danger to liberty

<p>narrowly into the question.&quot;
</p>
<p>172 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; I never have. I have no doubt of our wrongs ;
</p>
<p>but I have never suffered myself to weigh them
</p>
<p>against disunion. That I have been taught to regard
</p>
<p>as the maximum of evil.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But disunion has now come. The question now
</p>
<p>is, whether you shall continue to bear these wrongs,
</p>
<p>or seek the remedy offered by an invitation to join
</p>
<p>the Southern Confederacy. The evils of which you
</p>
<p>speak would certainly not be increased by such a
</p>
<p>step. We might weaken the North, but not our
</p>
<p>selves. As to standing armies, here we have one
</p>
<p>among us. The motive which that danger presented
</p>
<p>is now reversed in its operation. While we remain
</p>
<p>as we are, the standing army is fastened upon us.
</p>
<p>By the proposed change we shake it off. Then, as to
</p>
<p>dissension, if there is no cause of war now, there
</p>
<p>would be none then. Indeed the only cause would
</p>
<p>be removed, and it would be seen that both parties
</p>
<p>had every inducement to peace. Even in the present
</p>
<p>unnatural condition, you see that the separation
</p>
<p>having once taken place, there remains nothing to
</p>
<p>quarrel about.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What, then,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; is the meaning of
</p>
<p>all this military array that I see ? A.re no hostile
</p>
<p>movements apprehended from the Southern Con
</p>
<p>federacy ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all. They have no such thought. The
</p>
<p>talk of such things is nothing but a pretext for muz
</p>
<p>zling Virginia.&quot;

<p>&quot; You will know if you attend the election in this
</p>
<p>county to-morrow. You will then see that,a detach
</p>
<p>ment of troops has been ordered here on the eve oi
</p>
<p>the election. The ostensible use of it, is to aid in
</p>
<p>the prevention of smuggling, or, in other words, in
</p>
<p>the enforcement of the odious tariff, and a participa
</p>
<p>tion in the advantages our southern neighbors enjoy
</p>
<p>since they have shaken it off. But you will see this

<p>force employed to brow-beat and intimidate the

<p>people, and to drive from the polls such as cannot
</p>
<p>be brought to vote in conformity to the will of our
</p>
<p>rulers. Go back to Richmond next winter, and you
</p>
<p>will see, the force stationed there increased to what

<p>will l&amp;gt;e called an army of observation. In the midst

<p>of this, the Legislature will hold its mock delibera

<p>as to bridle the disaffected counties, and prevent the

</p>
<p>SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>As Mr. Trevor had intimated, the next day was
</p>
<p>the day for the election of members to the State
</p>
<p>Legislature. The old gentleman, in spite of his
</p>
<p>infirmities, determined to be present. He ordered
</p>
<p>his barouche, and provided with arms both the ser
</p>
<p>vant who drove him, and one who attended on
</p>
<p>horseback. He armed himself also with pistols and a
</p>
<p>dirk, and recommended a like precaution to Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; You must go on horseback,&quot; said he. &quot; It may
</p>
<p>enable you to act with more efficiency on an emer
</p>
<p>gency. At all events, were you to drive me, I

<p>should have no excuse for taking one whose services

<p>danger. As to you, my son, I think your late master

<p>should, therefore, be on your guard. My infirmities

<p>to the polls. Keep near me, therefore ; but keep
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 17$
</p>
<p>cool, and leave me to fight my own battles. Pru
</p>
<p>dence and forbearance are necessary for you. As
</p>
<p>to me, I have nothing to hazard. The measure of
</p>
<p>my offences is full already. I have sinned the un
</p>
<p>pardonable sin, and although there is no name for it
</p>
<p>in the statute book, I have no doult if they had me
</p>
<p>before their new Court of High Commission at Wash
</p>
<p>ington, your special friend, Judge Baker, would find
</p>
<p>one.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Why do you call him my special friend?&quot; asked
</p>
<p>Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Because I have means of being advised of what
</p>
<p>is doing among our rulers, and know that he was at
</p>
<p>the bottom of the whole proceeding against you.
</p>
<p>Therefore, I warn you to be prudent to-day. De
</p>
<p>pend upon it, if you can be taken in a fault, he will
</p>
<p>find means to feed fat his grudge against you.&quot;
</p>
<p>On reaching the election ground, the stars and
</p>
<p>stripes were seen floating above the door of the
</p>
<p>court-house, which was still closed. A military
</p>
<p>parade was &quot; being enacted&quot; for the amusement
</p>
<p>of the boys and cake- women, and the uniform
</p>
<p>showed that the men were regulars in the service
</p>
<p>of the United States. They were twenty or thirty in
</p>
<p>number, all completely armed and equipped. As
</p>
<p>soon as Mr. Trevor appeared, they were dismissed
</p>
<p>from parade, the door was thrown open, and they
</p>
<p>rushed into the house. Presently after, it was pro
</p>
<p>claimed that the polls were opened.

<p>As Mr. Trevor approached the door, Douglas
</p>
<p>176 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>observed that a multitude of persons, who before
</p>
<p>had been looking on, in silent observance of what was
</p>
<p>passing, advanced to salute him, and, falling behind
</p>
<p>him, followed to the court-house. On reaching the
</p>
<p>door, they found it effectually blocked up by half a
</p>
<p>dozen soldiers, who stood in and about, as if by
</p>
<p>accident and inadvertence. But the unaccommodat
</p>
<p>ing stiffness with which each maintained his posi
</p>
<p>tion, left no doubt that they were there by design.
</p>
<p>They were silent, but their brutish countenances
</p>
<p>spoke their purpose and feelings. Mr. Trevor might
</p>
<p>have endeavored in vain to force his passage, had
</p>
<p>. not the weight of the crowd behind pressed him
</p>
<p>through the door. In this process he was exposed
</p>
<p>to some suffering, but made no complaint. The
</p>
<p>effect appeared only in the flush of his check, and
</p>
<p>the twitching of his features. The blood of Douglas
</p>
<p>began to boil, and, for the first time in his life, the
</p>
<p>uniform he had so long worn was hateful in his
</p>
<p>sight.
</p>
<p>On entering the house, they were nearly deafened
</p>
<p>with the din. It proceeded from quite a small
</p>
<p>number, but they made amends for their deficiency
</p>
<p>in this respect, by clamorously shouting their hurras
</p>
<p>for the President, and his favored candidate. Be
</p>
<p>sides the soldiery, there were present the sheriff,
</p>
<p>who conducted the election, and some twenty or
</p>
<p>thirty of the lowest rabble. On the bench were two

<p>candidates. The countenance of one of those was

<p>pale and agitated. lie was placed between his
</p>
<p>competitor and a subaltern officer of the United
</p>
<p>States army. He seemed to have been saying some
</p>
<p>thing, and at the moment when Mr. Trevor and his
</p>
<p>party entered, was about to withdraw.
</p>
<p>Meeting him at the foot of the stair leading dowi?
</p>
<p>from the bench, that gentleman asked him the
</p>
<p>meaning of what he saw; to which he answered
</p>
<p>that he had been compelled to withdraw. The
</p>
<p>meeting of these two gentlemen had attracted
</p>
<p>attention, and curiosity to hear what might pass
</p>
<p>between them, for a moment stilled the many-
</p>
<p>tongued clamor. Mr. Trevor took advantage of the
</p>
<p>temporary silence, and said aloud : &quot;You have been

<p>compelled to withdraw. Speak out distinctly, then,
</p>
<p>and say that you are no longer a candidate.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Fellow-citizens,&quot; responded the other, in the
</p>
<p>loudest tones his tremor enabled him to command,
</p>
<p>&quot; I am no longer a candidate.&quot;

<p>&quot; AND I AM A CANDIDATE,&quot; cried Mr. Trevor in
</p>

<p>The shout from behind the bar, at this annuncia

<p>his friends ; when the officer was heard to cry out,

</p>
<p>looked at him imploringly. He was set down by
</p>
<p>the side of the officer, and, leaning on the shoulder
</p>
<p>of Douglas, thus addressed him
</p>
<p>&quot; I shall say nothing, sir,&quot; said he, &quot; to the sherifl
</p>
<p>about his duty. He is the judge of that, and he
</p>
<p>knows that, without my consent, he has no right to
</p>
<p>close the polls before sunset. Unless compelled by
</p>
<p>force, he will not do it. He shall not be compelled
</p>
<p>by force ; and, if force is used, I shall know whence
</p>
<p>it comes. Now mark me, sir; I am determined
</p>
<p>that this election shall go on, and that peaceably,
</p>
<p>[f force is used, it must be used first on me. Now,
</p>
<p>sir, my friends are numerous and brave, and well
</p>
<p>iriued, and I warn you that my fall will be the
</p>
<p>uignal of your doom. Not one of your bayoneted
</p>
<p>&amp;lt;M-ew would leave this house alive. As to you, sir,
</p>
<p>[ keep my eye upon you. You stir not from my
</p>
<p>aide, till the polls are closed. I hold you as a hos
</p>
<p>tage for the safety of the sheriif. If an attack is
</p>
<p>made on him, I shall know you for the instigator.
</p>
<p>And, more than that, sir, I know he is disposed to
</p>
<p>do his duty, and will not think of closing the polls
</p>
<p>prematurely. A menace addressed to him may
</p>
<p>escape my ear. If he offers to do it, if he does but
</p>
<p>open his mouth to declare that the polls are closed,
</p>
<p>I blow your brains out on the spot.&quot;
</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word, he, at the same
</p>
<p>moment, showed a pistol, the finish of which gave
</p>
<p>assurance that it would not miss fire. The officer

<p>started back in evident alarm, and made a move-

<p>179

<p>ment to withdraw ; hut he found himself hedged in
</p>
<p>by brawny countrymen, who closed around him,
</p>
<p>while every hand was seen to gripe the handle 01
</p>
<p>some concealed weapon.
</p>
<p>&quot; Be patient, sir/ said Mr. Trevor, &quot; you had no
</p>
<p>&quot;business here ; but, being here, you shall remain.
</p>
<p>No harm shall be done you. I will ensure you
</p>
<p>against every thing but the consequences of your
</p>
<p>own violence. Offer none. For if you do but lift
</p>
<p>your hand, or touch your weapons, or utter one word
</p>
<p>to your myrmidons, you die.&quot;
</p>
<p>These words were uttered in a tone in which,
</p>
<p>though loud enough to be heard by all, there was as
</p>
<p>much of mildness as of firmness. Indeed his last
</p>
<p>fearful expression was actually spoken as in kindness.
</p>
<p>The officer seemed to take it so, and quietly seated
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>Not so the rival candidate. He rose, with a great
</p>
<p>parade of indignation, saying : &quot; Let me pass, at
</p>
<p>least. This is no place for me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Do you mean to leave us, sir?&quot; said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>with great courtesy.
</p>
<p>&quot; I do,&quot; said the other. &quot; To what purpose should
</p>
<p>I remain ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Do you then decline ? Are you no longer a
</p>
<p>candidate ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am ; but I will not remain here beset by armed
</p>
<p>violence.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Will you leave one to represent you ?&quot;

</p>
<p>consent to nothing. When the law closes the poll,
</p>
<p>it will be closed.&quot;
</p>
<p>Saying this, he withdrew, and Mr. Trevor observed
</p>
<p>that, as he went out, he spoke aside to the sergeant
</p>
<p>of the company, who followed him from the house.
</p>
<p>Soon after, the men, one by one, dropped off, and all
</p>
<p>at length disappeared.
</p>
<p>The election now went on peaceably, and nearly
</p>
<p>every vote was cast for Mr. Trevor. But it did not
</p>
<p>escape his observation that there were persons pre
</p>
<p>sent whom he knew to be hostile to him, and devoted
</p>
<p>to the rulers at Washington, who yet did not vote.
</p>
<p>He saw the motive of this conduct, but determined
</p>
<p>to make it manifest to others as well as himself, and
</p>
<p>to expose the disingenuous and unmanly artifice
</p>
<p>which he saw his enemies were using against him.
</p>
<p>Catching the eye of a well dressed man he said,
</p>
<p>&quot; You have not voted, I think, Mr. A ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have not,&quot; was the answer, &quot; and I don t mean
</p>
<p>to vote.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I beg that you will, sir,&quot; said Mr. Trevor. &quot; I
</p>
<p>know you to be my enemy, personal as well as poli

<p>tical ; but I sincerely wish the name of every voter
</p>
<p>in the county to appear on the poll book, though
</p>
<p>my defeat should be the consequence.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It may be so, sir,&quot; replied the other ; &quot; but I

<p>shall not vote at an election, controlled by force, and

</p>
<p>&quot; I do not understand you, sir,&quot; said Mr. Trevor.
</p>
<p>&quot; Am I to infer that the presence of the military here
</p>
<p>is under the avowed orders of their master ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I dare say,&quot; replied the other, &quot; that Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Johnson will show you his orders, if you will conde

<p>scend to look at them.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I will do so, with great pleasure,&quot; said Mr. Tre

<p>perusal.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I will read them, sir,&quot; said tke officer, taking a
</p>
<p>paper from his pocket, which he read accordingly in
</p>
<p>the following words :
</p>
<p>&quot; As there is reason to believe that evil disposed

<p>persons design to overawe or disturb the election of

<p>Lieutenant Johnson will attend at the day and place

<p>of election with the troops under his command, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of preserving order. Should his autho
</p>
<p>rity be opposed, he is, if permitted to do so, to make
</p>
<p>known that he acts by the command of the Presi

<p>dent, to the end that all who may be disposed to
</p>
<p>resist him, may be duly warned that in so doing
</p>
<p>they resist the authority of the United States, and
</p>
<p>take heed lest they incur the penalties of the law.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, this is well,&quot; said Mr. Trevor. &quot;And it
</p>
<p>is to give color and countenance to a charge of resist
</p>
<p>ance to the authority of the United States, that you,
</p>

</p>
<p>Be it so,&quot; said Mr. Trevor. &quot; I perceive your
</p>
<p>drift. Go, then, and tell your master that the means
</p>
<p>used to vindicate the freedom of election were used
</p>
<p>to control it. Go, sir, % and show that you are as
</p>
<p>much an enemy to truth and honor as to me.&quot;
</p>
<p>To this A made no reply, and soon after with
</p>
<p>drew. Indeed, hardly any person remained but the
</p>
<p>friends of Mr. Trevor, and it was obvious that the
</p>
<p>result of the election was not to be changed by any
</p>
<p>votes which could be given. The necessity of keep
</p>
<p>ing open the poll till sunset was, nevertheless, impe
</p>
<p>rious. But the scene became dull and irksome.-
</p>
<p>Douglas, therefore, proposed that his uncle should
</p>
<p>return home.
</p>
<p>&quot; By no means,&quot; said he. &quot; You don t understand
</p>
<p>this game. Should we disband, the sheriff would be
</p>
<p>required, at the peril of his life, to make a false re
</p>
<p>turn. But he shall have his will. Mr. Sheriff, shall
</p>
<p>I withdraw also ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; No ! no ! For God s sake, stay, sir !&quot; exclaimed
</p>
<p>the alarmed sheriff; &quot;and either see me home, or
</p>
<p>take me home with you. I have not the influence
</p>
<p>which makes you safe in the midst of enemies, and
</p>
<p>am not ashamed to say that I fear my life.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I will protect you, then, sir,&quot; said Mr. Trevor,
</p>
<p>&quot; until you have made out your return, and given
</p>
<p>your certificate. When these are done, I hope you
</p>
<p>will be safe.&quot;

</p>
<p>the captive officer, who looked on ruefully, while
</p>
<p>an occasional vote was given at long intervals. At
</p>
<p>length, Mr. Trevor observed that some of the voters
</p>
<p>were about to withdraw. He therefore rose, and
</p>
<p>begged them to remain.
</p>
<p>u This business is not over,&quot; said he. &quot; It is not
</p>
<p>for nothing that the polls are to be kept open until
</p>
<p>sunset, when all who have not voted have with
</p>
<p>drawn. An attack on the sheriff or myself is cer
</p>
<p>tainly intended. Perhaps on both. I beseech you,
</p>
<p>therefore, not to disperse, but to see us both safe
</p>
<p>to my house. When once among my own people,
</p>
<p>I will take care of him and myself. I am sorry,
</p>
<p>sir,&quot; continued he, addressing the officer, &quot; that the
</p>
<p>movements of your friends make it necessary to
</p>
<p>detain you longer than I had intended. You must
</p>
<p>be a hostage for us all, until this day s work is
</p>
<p>over. But assure yourself of being treated with
</p>
<p>all courtesy and kindness. Should I even find it
</p>
<p>necessary to compel your company to my own house,
</p>
<p>doubt not that you will receive every attention due
</p>
<p>to an honored guest. I beg you to observe that
</p>
<p>I do not even disarm you. The warning you have
</p>
<p>received is my only security that you will attempt
</p>
<p>no violence.&quot;
</p>
<p>This speech was heard in sullen silence by him to
</p>
<p>whom it was addressed. But some conversation
</p>
<p>with others ensued, in which Mr. Trevor took pains
</p>
<p>to enlighten the minds of his hearers in regard to

</p>
<p>wearily ; the sun went down, and Bernard Trevor
</p>
<p>was proclaimed to be duly elected.
</p>
<p>Our party now took up the line of inarch. The
</p>
<p>sheriff and officer were placed in Mr. Trevor s ba
</p>
<p>rouche; the former by his side the latter in front
</p>
<p>of him, by the side of the driver. A numerous com
</p>
<p>pany on horseback surrounded them.
</p>
<p>They were scarcely in motion, before the drum
</p>
<p>was heard, and the regulars were seen advancing to
</p>
<p>meet them in military array. Mr. Trevor imme
</p>
<p>diately commanded the driver to stop, and draw his
</p>
<p>pistol. Then calling to the servant on horseback, he
</p>
<p>made him station himself, pistol in hand, close to
</p>
<p>the officer. Having made this arrangement, he ad
</p>
<p>dressed him :
</p>
<p>&quot; You see your situation, sir. Those fellows would
</p>
<p>not scruple to shoot your master himself at my bid
</p>
<p>ding ; and my orders to you both, boys, are, that if
</p>
<p>we are attacked, you are both to shoot this gentle
</p>
<p>man upon the spot. I shall do the same thing, sir ;
</p>
<p>so that between us you cannot escape, ^ow, sir,
</p>
<p>stand up and show yourself to your men, and speak
</p>
<p>distinctly the words of command that I shall dic
</p>
<p>tate.&quot;
</p>
<p>The officer did as he was directed. The advancing
</p>
<p>platoon was halted, and wheeled backward to the side
</p>
<p>of the road ; the arms were ordered, and the barouche
</p>
<p>passed on. After passing, a momentary stop was

<p>made, while the sergeant was ordered to march the

</p>
<p>SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>THE domestic party that we left at the house of
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor were variously affected by the history of
</p>
<p>the occurrences detailed in the last chapter. Arthur
</p>
<p>had been slightly indisposed, and his uncle had made
</p>
<p>that a pretext for keeping him out of harm s way.
</p>
<p>But when he heard what had passed, his spirit was
</p>
<p>roused, and he felt as a soldier who hears the history
</p>
<p>of some well-fought battle where he was not permit
</p>
<p>ted to be present. To Virginia the whole story was
</p>
<p>a subject of wonderment and alarm. The idea that
</p>
<p>her dear uncle, and her dearer brother, had been en
</p>
<p>gaged in an affair where u dirk and pistol&quot; was the
</p>
<p>word, threw her into a flutter of trepidation. She
</p>
<p>could not refrain from asking the former whether he
</p>
<p>would have shot the poor man sure enough ; and
</p>
<p>received his affirmative answer with a shudder. The
</p>
<p>feelings of Lucia did not much differ from hers, ex
</p>
<p>cept in intensity. She had heard too much to be

</p>
<p>wholly unprepared for such things, and her mind
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 187
</p>
<p>was too much accustomed to take its tone from those
</p>
<p>of her mother and sister.
</p>
<p>On these ladies the impression made by the events
</p>
<p>of the day was wholly different. If the countenance
</p>
<p>of Mrs. Trevor was more thoughtful than before, it
</p>
<p>only spoke of higher thoughts. Her eye was brighter,
</p>
<p>her carriage more erect, her step more free, while her
</p>
<p>smile had less, perhaps, of quiet satisfaction, but
</p>
<p>more of hope. The flutter of youthful feelings, and
</p>
<p>the sweeter and more tender thoughts proper to one
</p>
<p>newly betrothed, made the chief difference between
</p>
<p>Delia and her mother. But while Douglas saw in
</p>
<p>the latter all the evidence of those high qualities
</p>
<p>which fit a woman to be not merely the consolation
</p>
<p>and joy of her husband, but his sage adviser and
</p>
<p>useful friend, he saw enough in Delia to show that
</p>
<p>she, in due time, would be to him all that her mother
</p>
<p>was to his uncle.
</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, Mr. B arrived, and his
</p>
<p>appearance was a signal of joy to the whole family.
</p>
<p>Douglas now, for the first time, discovered that he
</p>
<p>stood in some interesting, though undefined relation
</p>
<p>to them, and especially to his aunt. That there was
</p>
<p>no connexion of blood or marriage he knew, yet the
</p>
<p>feelings of the parties towards each other were mu
</p>
<p>tually filial and paternal. The imposing dignity of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Trevor s manner seemed to be surrendered in
</p>
<p>his presence. Her maiden name of Margaret, which
</p>
<p>no other lip but that of her husband would have ven

</p>
<p>tured to profane, was that by which alone he ever
</p>
<p>1 88 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>accosted her, and that generally accompanied with
</p>
<p>some endearing epithet. The girls would sit upon
</p>
<p>his knee, and play familiarly and affectionately with
</p>
<p>his grey locks ; while the servants, in the proud
</p>
<p>humility of their attention to his wants and wishes,
</p>
<p>seemed hardly to distinguish between him and their
</p>
<p>beloved and honored master. It was not to be be
</p>
<p>lieved that the family kept any secrets from him, so
</p>
<p>that Douglas could not doubt that he was privy to
</p>
<p>his little affair of the heart. And so he was ; and his
</p>
<p>manner toward the young man was, from the first,
</p>
<p>that of a near kinsman, hardly differing in any thing
</p>
<p>from that of his uncle. As far as coincidence of sen
</p>
<p>timent and similarity of character could explain this
</p>
<p>close intimacy, it stood explained. Between him
</p>
<p>and Mr. Trevor there were many points of strong
</p>
<p>similitude. But to Mrs. Trevor the resemblance was
</p>
<p>more striking. Age and sex seemed to make the
</p>
<p>only difference between them.
</p>
<p>But, in addition to this domestic relation, which
</p>
<p>embraced every member of the household down to
</p>
<p>the scullion and shoe-black, there was obviously some
</p>
<p>understanding between the gentlemen in regard to
</p>
<p>matters of much higher concernment. Indeed, no
</p>
<p>pains were taken to conceal this fact, though, during
</p>
<p>Mr. B s former visit, Douglas had not been admit
</p>
<p>ted to any of their consultations but that which con
</p>
<p>cerned himself.
</p>
<p>It was not long before the two were closeted, in

<p>the little study, in close conclave ; and soon after, a

<p>The Partisan Leader. 189
</p>
<p>message was delivered to Douglas requesting his
</p>
<p>presence.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am the bearer of important intelligence,&quot; said
</p>
<p>B .holding out his hand to the youth as he entered ;
</p>
<p>&quot;and as it particularly concerns you, as well as your
</p>
<p>uncle, you must perforce consent to become privy
</p>
<p>to our council.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not sorry to hear it,&quot; replied Douglas. &quot; If
</p>
<p>any thing was wanting to banish all reserve between
</p>
<p>us, I would be content to suffer some loss to effect
</p>
<p>that object.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I believe you,&quot; said B , &quot; and therefore expect
</p>
<p>you will the less regret an unpleasant circumstance,
</p>
<p>which, without your act or consent, and even in spite
</p>
<p>of you, binds you in the same bundle with us.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That was already done,&quot; said Douglas. &quot; What

<p>new tie can there be ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; One of the strongest. The union of your name
</p>
<p>with your uncle s in a warrant for high treason from
</p>
<p>the court of high commission at Washington.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;You speak riddles,&quot; said Douglas. &quot;The only
</p>
<p>instance in which I ever incurred the displeasure of
</p>
<p>the President, was one which no human ingenuity
</p>
<p>could torture into treason ; and certainly my uncle
</p>
<p>had no hand in that.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But, having then incurred the displeasure of the
</p>
<p>Government, what if you -should since have been
</p>
<p>concerned in any matter which might be called
</p>
<p>treason ?&quot;

<p>&quot; But there has been no such matter.&quot;
</p>
<p>1 90 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot;My dear boy,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot;the question
</p>
<p>is not of what we have done. Had we actually done
</p>
<p>any thing culpable, there would be no occasion for
</p>
<p>this warrant from Washington. Our own courts,
</p>
<p>and a jury of peers, may be trusted to try the guilty.
</p>
<p>But when men are to be tried for what they have not
</p>
<p>done, then resort must be had to this new court of
</p>
<p>high commission at Washington, and to a jury of
</p>
<p>office-holders.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But where,&quot; asked Douglas, &quot;is the warrant of
</p>
<p>which you speak ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That I cannot exactly say,&quot; said B . &quot; I am
</p>
<p>not even sure that it is yet in existence. But that it
</p>
<p>is, or will be, is certain. I need not explain to you
</p>
<p>my means of knowledge. Your uncle is acquainted
</p>
<p>with them, and knows that what I tell you is certain.
</p>
<p>The transactions of the election day will be made the
</p>
<p>subject of a capital charge, and it is intended to con
</p>
<p>vey you both to Washington to answer it there. I
</p>
<p>am come to advise you both of this, that you may
</p>
<p>determine what course to pursue.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; My course is plain,&quot; said Douglas. &quot; To meet
</p>
<p>the charge, and refute it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Are you aware,&quot; said B , &quot; who is the Judge of
</p>
<p>this court of high commission?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I think I have somehow understood that it is
</p>
<p>Judge Baker.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;The father of your friend, Philip Baker, the
</p>
<p>younger. Now are you aware that, but a few days

<p>before the court was constituted, he and other judges
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 191
</p>
<p>were consulted, and declared it to be so grossly un
</p>
<p>constitutional that no judge would preside in it?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I see that so it should be declared, but did not
</p>
<p>know that such opinion had been given.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Yet so it was. ISTow where, do you think, the
</p>
<p>considerations were found by which the honorable
</p>
<p>gentleman s honorable scruples were overcome ? Of
</p>
<p>course, you cannot conjecture. You would find it,
</p>
<p>all too late, if you, by placing yourself in his power,
</p>
<p>afforded him an opportunity of gratifying the malice
</p>
<p>of his son, without exposing his cowardice and
</p>
<p>meanness. I see you doubt my means of knowledge.
</p>
<p>Your uncle told me nothing of young Whiting s
</p>
<p>communication to the President. Yet I knew of it.
</p>
<p>I know,&quot; continued B , not regarding the amaze
</p>
<p>ment of Douglas, &quot; that, but for that letter, you
</p>
<p>would not have been permitted to resign ; and that
</p>
<p>Judge Baker s scruples about presiding in this new
</p>
<p>court were overcome by hushing up the inquiry,
</p>
<p>which would have dishonored his son, and substitut
</p>
<p>ing a proceeding which should number you among
</p>
<p>the victims of his power, without implicating the
</p>
<p>name of his son. As to my means of knowledge,
</p>
<p>when knaves can get honest men to be the instru
</p>
<p>ments of their villany, they may expect not to be
</p>
<p>betrayed. Until then, they must bear the fate of all
</p>
<p>who work with sharp tools.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; There can be no doubt,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; of
</p>
<p>the fate prepared for us, should we fall into the hands

<p>of our enemies. To be summoned to trial before a
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>court confuted for the sole purpose of entertaining
</p>
<p>prosecutions which cannot be sustained elsewhere, is
</p>
<p>to be notified of a sentence already passed. To obey
</p>
<p>such a summons, is to give the neck to the halter.
</p>
<p>The question is, then, what is to be done to evade it.
</p>
<p>Our friend B - proposes that your brother and sister
</p>
<p>be sent home, and that you and I, and my family,
</p>
<p>withdraw to Carolina.- How say you ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have the same difficulty that I had, the other
</p>
<p>day, about tendering my resignation. But, in this
</p>
<p>instance, it appears with more force. To fly from
</p>
<p>justice is always taken as evidence of conscious
</p>
<p>guilt.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;About that,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot;I feel small
</p>
<p>concern on my own account, as I certainly mean to
</p>
<p>commit what all who deny the sovereignty of Virginia
</p>
<p>will call high treason.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Then why not take up arms at once? I have
</p>
<p>much misunderstood appearances, since I have been
</p>
<p>here, if the means, not of evading, but resisting this
</p>
<p>attack, are not already organized.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;The time is not yet ripe for action,&quot; said Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor. &quot; Had it been so, I should not have waited
</p>
<p>until my own head was in jeopardy, before striking
</p>
<p>the blow. Nor should my own personal danger
</p>
<p>precipitate it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But what fitter time can there be to call the peo
</p>
<p>ple to arms, than at this moment, when their minds
</p>
<p>are heated by the late violent invasion of the elective

<p>franchise? What more exciting spectacle could be
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 193
</p>
<p>presented than the sight of a citizen seized as a traitor,
</p>
<p>and dragged away in chains, to answer, before an uncon
</p>
<p>stitutional tribunal, for maintaining this franchise ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Are you then prepared to resist, at the point of
</p>
<p>the bayonet, this unconstitutional warrant, as a thing
</p>
<p>void and of no authority ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am&quot; replied Douglas, with energy. &quot; And I
</p>
<p>will say more,&quot; said he, speaking with solemn earnest
</p>
<p>ness. &quot; I have seen enough to make my duty plain ;
</p>
<p>and I am prepared to go as far as you, yourself, in
</p>
<p>asserting and maintaining the sovereignty of Virginia
</p>
<p>at every hazard.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That being the case,&quot; said B , &quot; as you will not
</p>
<p>disagree about the end, you must not differ about the
</p>
<p>means, nor lose time discussing them. W$ are not
</p>
<p>thinking of this subject for the first time. We
</p>
<p>see the whole ground, and act under the influence of
</p>
<p>considerations which we have no time to detail. Are
</p>
<p>you then, my young friend, prepared to give us so
</p>
<p>much of your confidence as this ? We say to you,
</p>
<p>Go with us where we go, and trust our assurance
</p>
<p>that when we have leisure to explain all, you will
</p>
<p>find our plan the best. Are you content? Are you
</p>
<p>now ready to carry into execution our matured plan,
</p>
<p>so far as it has been disclosed to you, trusting all the
</p>
<p>details to us? Remember if you say yes to this,
</p>
<p>we stop no more to deliberate or explain until we are
</p>
<p>in a place of safety. Until then, you place yourself
</p>
<p>under orders ; and you have learned how to obey.
</p>
<p>How say you ? Are you content?&quot;

<p>Douglas paused, reflected a minute or two, and
</p>
<p>then, extending a hand to Mr. B , and one to his
</p>
<p>uncle, said earnestly : &quot; I am ; command, and I will
</p>
<p>obey. But which of you am I to obey ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Mr. B ,&quot; said Mr. Trevor, &quot; under whose com

<p>mand I now place myself.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Then to business,&quot; said B . &quot;Warn your
</p>
<p>brother, at once, of the necessity of returning home
</p>
<p>with your sister, and see that he makes the needful
</p>
<p>preparations for his departure at an early hour to
</p>
<p>morrow. The boy s heart will have some hankerings
</p>
<p>that will make it necessary for you to look after him,
</p>
<p>and urge him to exertion. You, Trevor, must ex
</p>
<p>pedite the arrangements for the removal of your
</p>
<p>family. Pass the word to Margaret and Delia. You
</p>
<p>may trust much to their efficiency. I am afraid we

<p>cannot expect much more from my poor little Lucia,
</p>
<p>just now, than from Arthur. Now, Trevor, give me
</p>
<p>the keys of your arm-room ; let Douglas join me

<p>there, as soon as he has set Arthur to work, and, in

<p>the meantime, send Jack to me there. I will play

</p>
<p>CHAPTEE XXII.
</p>
<p>&quot; I have nursed him at this withered breast,&quot; said the old woman,
</p>
<p>folding her hands on her bosom as if pressing an infant to it; &quot;and
</p>
<p>man can never ken what woman feels for the bairn that she has first

<p>POOTC AKTHUE ! B had predicted too truly
</p>
<p>that his heart would have some hankerings at the
</p>
<p>thought of leaving the house where he had, of late,
</p>
<p>spent so many pleasant hours. It is so long that I
</p>
<p>have said nothing about him, that the reader may
</p>
<p>think him forgotten, or may, himself, have forgotten
</p>
<p>that there was such a person. He had, in truth, no part
</p>
<p>in the transactions of which we have been speaking.
</p>
<p>He was at that time of life when the mind, chame
</p>
<p>leon-like, takes its hue from surrounding objects.
</p>
<p>He was too young to be advised with, or trusted with
</p>
<p>important secrets. I have already mentioned that,
</p>
<p>on the day of the election, he had been detained at
</p>
<p>home by indisposition. But he had heard of the oc-

</p>
<p>currences of that day ; and he was, moreover, uncon
</p>
<p>sciously exposed to influences from every member of
</p>
<p>the family, all tending to the same point. Least ap
</p>
<p>parent, but not least efficacious, was that of his cousin
</p>
<p>Lucia. They were of that age when hearts, soft and
</p>
<p>warm, grow together by mere contact. With thought
</p>
<p>of love, but without thinking of it, they had become
</p>
<p>deeply enamored of each other. The thing came
</p>
<p>about so simply and so naturally, that the result alone
</p>
<p>needs to be told.
</p>
<p>They were now to part, and the thought of parting
</p>
<p>first made them both feel that something was the
</p>
<p>matter. They talked of the separation, and Lucia
</p>
<p>shed some tears. Arthur kissed them off, and then
</p>
<p>she smiled ; and then she wept again ; and then they
</p>
<p>agreed never to forgot each other ; and so on, till the
</p>
<p>secret was out, and their innocent hearts were fondly
</p>
<p>plighted.
</p>
<p>Such things do not pass unmarked by older eyes.
</p>
<p>The maternal instinct of Mrs. Trevor, and the sagacity
</p>
<p>of her husband, had detected that of which the par
</p>
<p>ties themselves were unconscious. And now, in the
</p>
<p>few hours that they were to remain together, occupied
</p>
<p>as the old people were with important engagements,
</p>
<p>neither the glowing cheek, the swimming eye, and
</p>
<p>the abstracted look of Lucia, nor the rapt enthu
</p>
<p>siasm of Arthur s countenance, escaped observation.
</p>
<p>But as no disclosure was made of what had passed,
</p>
<p>their fancied privacy was not invaded by question or

<p>insinuation. They were too young to marry, and secret
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 201
</p>
<p>love is so sweet ! &quot;Why not let the innocent crea
</p>
<p>tures enjoy the idea that their attachment was not
</p>
<p>suspected? Their friends smiled indeed, but ten
</p>
<p>derly, not significantly. To them, they did hut
</p>
<p>seem kinder than ever; and that, at a moment when
</p>
<p>they were most sensible to kindness, and most ready
</p>
<p>to reciprocate it. In this heart-searching sympathy,
</p>
<p>Arthur found himself indissolubly united- to the
</p>
<p>destiny, the opinions, and the feelings, whatever
</p>
<p>these might be, of those who so loved his dear
</p>
<p>Lucia.
</p>
<p>But I am not writing a love-tale. I am but inte
</p>
<p>rested that the reader should understand by what
</p>
<p>process two principal actors in the scenes of which
</p>
<p>I am about to speak, were diverted from a zealous
</p>
<p>devotion to the authority of the United States, in
</p>
<p>which they had been educated, to a devotion yet
</p>
<p>more enthusiastic in the cause of Virginia. Enough
</p>
<p>of them has been seen to show that I must be
</p>
<p>anxious to vindicate them from any charge of incon
</p>
<p>sistency. I trust the reader enters into this feeling,
</p>
<p>and deems them worthy of it. If he requires any
</p>
<p>farther account of the causes which wrought so great
</p>
<p>a change, Iliave none to give. It was through their
</p>
<p>eyes and hearts that conviction entered. Outrage
</p>
<p>to the laws ; outrage to the freedom of election ;
</p>
<p>outrage to one respected and beloved ; left nothing
</p>
<p>for reason to do. Doubtless much had been said to
</p>
<p>them by their uncle and Mr. B , in explanation

</p>
<p>which had been trampled on by the Federal,
</p>
<p>Government. But I am not aware that any ideas
</p>
<p>were presented to their minds on this subject, with
</p>
<p>which the reading public had not been familiar for
</p>
<p>twenty years before, and I shall not repeat them
</p>
<p>here. Let us rather accompany Douglas to Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor s magazine of arms. It was in a garret room,
</p>
<p>where he found Mr. B busy in the examination
</p>
<p>of arms, and portioning out ammunition, with the
</p>
<p>aid of Jack.
</p>
<p>&quot; You come in good time,&quot; said B . &quot; Here is
</p>
<p>work that you understand. Come help me examine
</p>
<p>these arms, and see that they are all clean, dry, and
</p>
<p>well flinted.&quot;
</p>
<p>u What do you propose to do with them?&quot; asked
</p>
<p>Dotiglas, lending a hand to the work.
</p>
<p>&quot; We propose,&quot; said B , &quot; to arm the negroes in
</p>
<p>defence of their master, in case of need.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But what need can there be, if we set out for
</p>
<p>Carolina in the morning ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;They may be wanted before morning,&quot; said
</p>
<p>B , coolly. &quot; Lieutenant Johnson left the county
</p>
<p>on the night of the election, and travelled express to
</p>
<p>Washington. His intelligence was anticipated, and,
</p>
<p>no doubt, the warrants were all ready before he got
</p>
<p>there. I daresay they had a ready-made affidavit
</p>
<p>for him to swear to. This plot was got up so sud
</p>
<p>denly, that I was hardly advised of it in time. But
</p>
<p>I hope it is not too late. I have no mind to fire the

<p>The Partisan Leader. 203
</p>
<p>peaceably, but, if we do come to blows, I shall take
</p>
<p>care that the blue-coats have the worst of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You move in this business,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; like
</p>
<p>a man not unused to danger. I presume you have
</p>
<p>taken the precaution to warn in the hardy and reso
</p>
<p>lute neighbors, whom I saw stand by my uncle the
</p>
<p>other day.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; By no means,&quot; answered B. &quot; Were we so
</p>
<p>minded, we could command a force that would de
</p>
<p>molish any that will be sent against us. But it is
</p>
<p>not desirable to show the strength of our hand. I
</p>
<p>should be glad, if possible, that the temper of the
</p>
<p>people were unsuspected. At the same time, there
</p>
<p>is an exhibition to be made, which will have a good
</p>
<p>effect on friend and foe I mean an exhibition of
</p>
<p>the staunch loyalty and heart- felt devotion of the
</p>
<p>slave to his master. &quot;We must show that that which
</p>
<p>our enemies, and some even of ourselves, consider as
</p>
<p>our weakness, is, in truth, our strength.&quot;
</p>

<p>las. &quot; I have lived so long in the North, that I have
</p>
<p>imbibed too many of the ideas that prevail there.
</p>
<p>But, on this point, it appears to me that they must

<p>be right.&quot;

<p>&quot; You have not lived there long enough,&quot; said

</p>
<p>on earth, if I did not love one who loves me like a

</p>
<p>&quot;And your foster-brother?&quot; asked B ; &quot;and
</p>
<p>his brothers and sisters ? Do not they, too, love him
</p>
<p>their mother loves so fondly ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have no doubt they do, especially as 1 have
</p>
<p>always been kind to them.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; From these, then, I presume, you would fear
</p>
<p>nothing. Then your brothers and sisters. They, too,
</p>
<p>have their mammies and foster-brethren. Among
</p>
<p>you, you must have a strong hold on the hearts of
</p>
<p>many of your father s slaves. Would they, think
</p>
<p>you, taken as a body, rise against your family ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I have not the least apprehension that they
</p>
<p>would,&quot; replied Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Yet they, thus considered, are one integral part
</p>
<p>of the great black family, which, in all its branches,
</p>
<p>is united by similar ligaments to the great white
</p>
<p>family. You have the benefit of the parental feeling
</p>
<p>of the old who nursed your infancy, and watched
</p>
<p>your growth. You have the equal friendship of
</p>
<p>those with whom you ran races, and played at
</p>
<p>bandy, and wrestled in your boyhood. If sometimes
</p>
<p>a dry blow passed between you, they love you none
</p>
<p>the less for that ; because, unless you were differently
</p>
<p>trained from what is common among our boys, you

<p>were taught not to claim any privilege, in a fight,

<p>over those whom you treated as equals in play.

</p>
<p>came home, making him proud by asking his name,
</p>
<p>and his mammy s name, and his daddy s name.
</p>
<p>These are the filaments which the heart puts out to
</p>
<p>lay hold on what it clings to. Great interests, like
</p>
<p>large branches, are too stiff to twine. These are the
</p>
<p>fibres from which the ties that bind man to man are
</p>
<p>spun. The finer the staple, the stronger the cord.
</p>
<p>You will probably see its strength exemplified before

<p>morning. There are twenty true hearts which will
</p>
<p>shed their last drop, before one hair of your uncle s
</p>
<p>head shall fall.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You present the matter in a new light,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Douglas. &quot; I wish our northern brethren could be
</p>
<p>made to take the same view of it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Our northern brethren, as you call them,&quot; said
</p>
<p>B , &quot; never can take this view of it. They have

<p>not the qualities which would enable them to com

<p>selfishness can never understand his disinterested
</p>
<p>devotion. Their artificial benevolence is no inter
</p>
<p>preter of the affections of the unsophisticated heart.
</p>
<p>They think our friend Jack here to be even such
</p>
<p>as themselves, and cannot therefore conceive that
</p>
<p>he is not ready to cut his master s throat, if there is
</p>
<p>anything to be got by it. They know no more

<p>of the feelings of our slaves, than their fathers

</p>
<p>2ob The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>which they have ever seemed to understand us,
</p>
<p>has been in the estimate they have made of our
</p>
<p>attachment to a Union, the benefits of which have
</p>
<p>all been theirs, the burthens ours. Be verse the
</p>
<p>case, and they would have dissolved the partner
</p>
<p>ship thirty years ago. But they have presumed
</p>
<p>upon the difference between us, and heaped oppres
</p>
<p>sion on oppression, until we can bear no more. But,
</p>
<p>when we throw off the yoke, they will still not
</p>
<p>understand us. They will impute to us none but
</p>
<p>selfish motives, and take no note of the scorn and
</p>
<p>loathing which their base abuse of our better feel
</p>
<p>ings has awakened. Would they but forbear so
</p>
<p>much as not to force us to hate and despise them,
</p>
<p>they might still use us as their hewers of wood and

<p>drawers of water. But he who gives all where he

<p>loves, will give nothing where he detests. Bat this,
</p>
<p>too, is a riddle for them.&quot;

<p>Osric . . . How is it, Laertes ?

<p>Laertes . . Why, as a woodcock to ray own springe, Osric.
</p>
<p>SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>WHILE this conversation was going on, the armg
</p>
<p>had been all examined, loaded, and ranged against
</p>
<p>the wall, and due portions of powder and ball allotted
</p>
<p>to each firelock. Their work being nearly completed,
</p>
<p>Douglas was dispatched with some message to his
</p>
<p>uncle. As he descended the stairs, he heard, not
</p>
<p>without a smile, the quick, impatient step of Arthur,
</p>
<p>pacing to and fro the length of a passage leading from
</p>
<p>the front door through the building. Arthur was
</p>
<p>just turning at the end next to the door, when a rap
</p>
<p>on the knocker arrested him. The door was instantly
</p>
<p>opened, and he was heard to ask some one to walk in.
</p>
<p>It was night, and the passage was dark. Arthur con
</p>
<p>ducted the stranger to the door of his uncle s study,
</p>
<p>which was the common reception room, ushered him
</p>
<p>in, drew back, and having closed the door behind
</p>
<p>him, resumed his musing promenade.
</p>
<p>Douglas went on, suspecting nothing. He was not
</p>
<p>aware that the servants had been cautioned against

</p>
<p>admitting strangers; and poor Arthur was not au

</p>
<p>fait to what was passing. He entered the room. His
</p>
<p>uncle had risen from his chair in the corner farthest
</p>
<p>from the door, and was standing behind a large table,
</p>
<p>at which he usually wrote. He heard him say :
</p>
<p>&quot; Please to be seated, sir,&quot; in a voice between com
</p>
<p>pliment and command, and with a countenance in
</p>
<p>which courtesy and fierceness were strangely blended.
</p>
<p>As the stranger, not regarding this stern invitation,
</p>
<p>continued to advance, the glare of the old man s eyes
</p>
<p>became fearful, and he laid his hand on a pistol which
</p>
<p>lay on the table before him. &quot; Stand back, sir,&quot; said
</p>
<p>he, in a low and resolute tone. &quot;Stand back, on
</p>
<p>your life.&quot;
</p>
<p>The stranger wore a long surtout, in which Doug
</p>
<p>las, dazzled by coming into the light, did not at first
</p>
<p>discover the usual characteristics of an officer s
</p>
<p>undress. It was thrown open in front, and the
</p>
<p>badges of his rank were displayed to Mr/ Trevor,
</p>
<p>who stood before him. He was arrested by Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor s startling words and gesture, and was begin
</p>
<p>ning to speak when Douglas exclaimed : &quot; What does
</p>
<p>this mean ? &quot;
</p>
<p>The stranger turned, extended both his arms, and
</p>
<p>Douglas rushed into them.
</p>
<p>&quot; My dear Trevor ! &quot; &quot; My dear Whiting ! &quot; were
</p>
<p>the mutual exclamations of two young men, who had
</p>
<p>long been to each other as brothers.
</p>
<p>&quot; To what on earth,&quot; asked Douglas, &quot; do I owo
</p>
<p>this pleasure ? &quot;

<p>&quot; I come,&quot; said the other, with a melancholy smile,
</p>
<p>210 The Partisan Leader
</p>
<p>and in the kindest tone, while he still held the hand
</p>
<p>of Douglas, &quot; to make you prisoner.&quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas started violently, and tried to disengage
</p>
<p>his hand : but the other held him firmly and went
</p>
<p>on : &quot; Be calm, my dear fellow. I am your friend as
</p>
<p>ever, but yet I do not jest. You are my prisoner, OH
</p>
<p>the absurd charge of high treason against the United
</p>
<p>States. My warrant is against you and your uncle.
</p>
<p>As it was thought a military force might be wanted
</p>
<p>to support the arrest, I volunteered myself to receive
</p>
<p>a deputation from the marshal that I might shield you
</p>
<p>both from any indignity. You, on your part, I am
</p>
<p>sure, will do nothing to make my task more painful
</p>
<p>than it is. Is not that gentleman bless me ! where
</p>
<p>is he? Was not that Mr. Bernard Trevor who just
</p>
<p>left the room ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am Mr. Bernard Trevor,&quot; said a voice behind.
</p>
<p>&quot;Whiting turned again, and saw Mr. Trevor standing
</p>
<p>where he had been before. He now observed that
</p>
<p>there was a door beside him, at which he had stepped
</p>
<p>out and returned. &quot; I am Mr. Bernard Trevor, sir,
</p>
<p>and am sorry that I cannot welcome, as I would, the
</p>
<p>friend of my nephew. You see that I have no mind
</p>
<p>to leave the room, and I therefore hope you will con
</p>
<p>tent yourself to accept my invitation to be seated.
</p>
<p>You say that you wish to shield me from indignity.
</p>
<p>Of course you will not unnecessarily offer what I
</p>
<p>shall feel as such. The hand of authority must not

<p>be laid on me&quot;

<p>&quot;I shall gladly dispense with an unpleasant form,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 211
</p>
<p>sir,&quot; said Whiting, &quot; and I trust I shall have the
</p>
<p>satisfaction of convincing yon that my errand, though
</p>
<p>painful to all of us, is an errand of friendship.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have no doubt of it, sir. I have heard of you
</p>
<p>from my nephew, and from under your own hand,
</p>
<p>in terms that give full assurance of that. I shall be
</p>
<p>happy, therefore, to do by you all the duties of hos
</p>
<p>pitality. I merely ask of you to give your word of
</p>
<p>honor, that, while charged with your present func
</p>
<p>tions, you will be careful not to touch my person.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I should be most happy,&quot; said the young man,
</p>
<p>&quot; to take by the hand one whom I so highly respect,
</p>
<p>but I find I must forego that pleasure ; and I give
</p>
<p>the required pledge most cheerfully*&quot;
</p>
<p>The courteous old gentleman now summoned
</p>
<p>Tom, and ordered some refreshment for his guest ;
</p>
<p>then throwing into his manner all the frank courtesy
</p>
<p>of a polished Virginian, he led the way in a desul
</p>
<p>tory conversation on all sorts of indifferent subjects.
</p>
<p>Half an hour passed in this way, when Tom appeared
</p>
<p>and summoned the gentlemen to supper.
</p>
<p>&quot; I fear,&quot; said Whiting, &quot; I am abusing my au
</p>
<p>thority over my poor fellows without. I have a
</p>
<p>sergeant and half-a-dozen men waiting at the gate,
</p>
<p>on whose behalf I would fain invoke your hospita

<p>lity. But it would be much more agreeable to me,
</p>
<p>if you and my friend Douglas will pass your words
</p>
<p>that their aid shall not be necessary, and permit me

<p>to order them back to the next public-house.&quot;

</p>
<p>I cannot do either; but I pray you to postpone the

<p>discussion until after supper.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How, sir ?&quot; exclaimed Whiting. &quot; You surely
</p>
<p>do not mean to try to escape me ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Nothing is farther from my thoughts, sir,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the old man, with a proud smile, &quot; than to try to
</p>
<p>escape you, or permit you to escape me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; To escape you, sir ! What do you mean ?&quot; asked
</p>
<p>Whiting.
</p>
<p>&quot; I mean not to wound your ear with a word I
</p>
<p>would not have endured to have applied to myself.
</p>
<p>I will not say that you are my prisoner; but I will
</p>
<p>say that we will leave this house as free as you
</p>
<p>entered it. Come, my dear sir, while I endeavor to
</p>
<p>requite your courtesy, permit me also to appropriate
</p>
<p>your words, and say, as you said to Douglas, that I
</p>
<p>trust you will not render it necessary to avail our
</p>
<p>selves of our superior force.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not sure you possess that superiority,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Whiting ; &quot; I have a strong guard without.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But they are without, and you are within. Be

<p>sides, you will be readily excused from availing

<p>yourself of them, when it is known that they are

<p>prisoners, in close custody.&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; I am not in the habit, young gentleman,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Mr. Trevor, in a tone of grave rebuke, &quot; of speak
</p>
<p>ing positively, when I speak by conjecture. JVIy
</p>
<p>orders were, that I should not be called to supper
</p>
<p>until they were secured. As to the strangeness of
</p>
<p>the affair,&quot; continued he, resuming his cheerful and
</p>
<p>good-humored smile, &quot; think nothing of that. Re
</p>
<p>member that night is what the negroes call their
</p>
<p>time of day. The eagle is no match for the owl in the
</p>
<p>dark. The thing is as I tell you ; so make yourself
</p>
<p>easy, and let me have the pleasure of doing the
</p>
<p>duties of hospitality by my nephew s friend. You
</p>
<p>shall not be unnecessarily detained. We must ask
</p>
<p>the pleasure of your company for a three hours ride
</p>
<p>across the line in the morning. I will there give
</p>
<p>you a clear acquittance against all the responsibility
</p>
<p>you may have incurred, for what you have done, or
</p>
<p>left undone; and, as soon as you return, to restrain
</p>
<p>your men from acts of license, they shall be given

<p>up to you.&quot;
</p>
<p>There was no remonstrating against this arrange
</p>
<p>ment; and Lieutenant Whiting, putting the best
</p>
<p>face he could on the matter, permitted himself to be
</p>
<p>conducted to supper.
</p>
<p>At the head of the supper table stood, as usual,

<p>Mrs. Trevor. She seemed some six inches higher
</p>
<p>than common, her cheek flushed, her nostril spread,

<p>her eye beaming;. yet with all her high feelings sub

<p>met and returned the salutation of Whiting with the

<p>214 Th e Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>stately grace of a high-bred-lady, and then her eye
</p>
<p>glanced to her husband with a look of irrepressible
</p>
<p>pride. His glance answered it, and, as they stood
</p>
<p>for a moment facing each other at the opposite ends
</p>
<p>of the table, Whiting felt a sense of admiring awe,
</p>
<p>such as the presence of majesty in full court had
</p>
<p>never inspired. But this feeling, in a moment,
</p>
<p>passed away, with its cause. The urbanity of the
</p>
<p>gentleman and the suavity of the lady soon removed
</p>
<p>all the painfulness of constraint, and the evening
</p>
<p>passed as it should pass between persons who in
</p>
<p>heart were friends.
</p>
<p>Neither Mr. B nor Arthur made their appear
</p>
<p>ance. The girls, indeed, were present. The air
</p>
<p>and manner of Delia reflected those of her mother.
</p>
<p>Virginia looked a little alarmed, and Lucia blush
</p>
<p>ing, tender, and abstracted. The interest of the
</p>
<p>realities that surrounded her could not quite dispel
</p>
<p>the visions of excited fancj^.
</p>
<p>With these exceptions, which a stranger would not
</p>
<p>observe, everything passed as in the company of an
</p>
<p>invited and cherished guest, and Whiting could not
</p>
<p>be sorry, at heart, that he had been baffled in his
</p>
<p>attempt to disturb so sweet a domestic party. The
</p>
<p>evening wore away not unpleasantly, and he retired
</p>
<p>to rest in the same room with Douglas, to guard him,
</p>
<p>or be guarded by him, according as it suited his fancy
</p>
<p>to consider himself or his friend as the other s prisoner.

</p>
<p>THE first words which passed between Mr. Trevor
</p>
<p>and Lieutenant Whiting, had been overheard by Tom,
</p>
<p>who was in the act of leaving the room at the mo
</p>
<p>ment. He gave the alarm to his mistress, who hasten
</p>
<p>ing to her husband, met him at the door, and just re
</p>
<p>ceived from him the instructions already mentioned.
</p>
<p>She immediately sent for Mr. B , who, with Jack s
</p>
<p>aid, was in the act of distributing arms and ammuni
</p>
<p>tion to the negroes. To him the management of the
</p>
<p>whole affair was committed. No doubt was enter
</p>
<p>tained that Lieutenant Whiting had not come unat
</p>
<p>tended. The first thing to be done was to ascertain
</p>
<p>the force by which he was supported, and the place
</p>
<p>where he had posted his men.
</p>
<p>They, meantime, quietly awaited the return of their
</p>
<p>officer at the great gate, a quarter of a mile from the
</p>
<p>house. Rather as a point of military etiquette than
</p>
<p>from an idea that any precaution was necessary, they
</p>
<p>had stacked their arms in form before the gate, and
</p>
<p>stationed a sentinel, who, with head erect and military

</p>
<p>not long been there, before they heard a negro s
</p>
<p>voice, who, as he approached from the house, sung
</p>
<p>merrily a song, of which only the following lines
</p>
<p>could be distinguished :
</p>
<p>&quot; Peep froo de winder ; see break o day ;
</p>
<p>Run down to riber ; canoe gone away.

<p>Hear O sur call me ; hear Missis scold.
</p>
<p>dear ! my dear ! what shall I do ?
</p>
<p>My Massa whip me, cause I love you.&quot;
</p>
<p>The song ceased, and cuffee advanced in silence,
</p>
<p>but with a heavy swinging step, that rung audibly on
</p>
<p>the hard ground. As soon as his dusky figure began
</p>
<p>to be distinguishable, which was not until he was
</p>
<p>quite near, he was arrested by the sharp challenge of
</p>
<p>the sentry.
</p>
<p>&quot;High!&quot; exclaimed the negro, in a tone of
</p>
<p>amazement and alarm: &quot; Law-Gorramiffhtv t what

<p>piece down with a rattling sound against his rigkt side.

</p>
<p>The Sergeant now went to him, raised him up,
</p>
<p>calmed his fears, and, as soon as he could be made to
</p>
<p>understand anything, asked if Lieutenant Whiting
</p>
<p>was at the house.
</p>
<p>&quot; I hear em say, sir, one mighty grand gentleman

</p>
<p>brought a chunk of fire ; another a basket of apples ;
</p>
<p>another one of eggs ; a fourth came provided with
</p>
<p>some cold provisions; Jack himself brandished a
</p>
<p>couple of bottles of brandy; and one of his bovs
</p>
<p>brought a pail of water and a tin cup. The lijuor
</p>
<p>was tasted, approved, paid for, and eagerly swallowed.
</p>
<p>A torch of light wood being kindled, a chaffering
</p>
<p>commenced, interrupted by occasional allusions to the
</p>
<p>interesting subjects of slavery, hard masters, and
</p>
<p>emancipation. The brandy, however, chiefly engaged
</p>
<p>the attention of the soldiers. The sentry, whose duty
</p>
<p>was but formal, was permitted to join, as the guns
</p>
<p>were but a few feet off. just without the gate, which
</p>
<p>stood open. The light of the torch glittered strongly
</p>
<p>on the arms, and seemed to make all things distinct,
</p>
<p>while in fact its unsteady flickering did little more
</p>
<p>than dazzle their eyes. The negro held it aloft, and,
</p>
<p>as if to brighten the flame, occasionally waved it to
</p>
<p>and fro. Suddenly it dropped from his hand into the
</p>
<p>pail of water, and in an instant the blackness of im
</p>
<p>penetrable darkness shrouded every eye.
</p>
<p>At the same moment, a heavy trampling, as from
</p>
<p>a rush of many feet, was heard without the gate, and
</p>
<p>a shivering clash from the stack of arms, as if it had
</p>
<p>fallen down. The soldiers groped their way towards
</p>
<p>it, feeling where they supposed it to be. They felt
</p>
<p>in vain. They winked hard, as if to free their ey&amp;lt;3
</p>
<p>from the blinding impression left by the flaring
</p>
<p>light, then opened them, and looked about. Judge

<p>their astonishment, when, as they began to recover
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 221
</p>
<p>their sight, they found themselves surrounded by a
</p>
<p>dusky ring, from which issued a voice, not unlike
</p>
<p>that of their friend Jack, which informed them, in
</p>
<p>good English, that they were prisoners. The prick
</p>
<p>of a bayonet on one or two who endeavored to pass
</p>
<p>through the circle, convinced them that such was
</p>
<p>the fact ; and, after a short parley, they permitted
</p>
<p>themselves to be marched off, and safely stowed
</p>
<p>away in a strong outhouse.
</p>
<p>I would not have the reader give the negroes the
</p>
<p>credit of this stratagem. It had been devised by
</p>
<p>B , who knew that he could depend upon the
</p>
<p>address and quick wit of Jack for drawing tho
</p>
<p>soldiers into the snare. All that part of the business
</p>
<p>had been left to his own discretion. As soon as he
</p>
<p>had secured the amicable reception of himself and a
</p>
<p>few others, the rest, dividing into two parties, left the
</p>
<p>house, and, crossing the fence at some distance from
</p>
<p>the gate, and on each side of it, advanced stealthily
</p>
<p>toward it. Here they met, and having arranged
</p>
<p>themselves for a sudden rush on the stack of arms,
</p>
<p>an agreed signal was given by a negro who pos
</p>
<p>sessed a faculty of mimicking the voices of all ani
</p>
<p>mals. As soon as the light was extinguished, the
</p>
<p>necessar}^ number rushed forward to the object on
</p>
<p>which their eyes had been fixed ; seized the arms,
</p>
<p>and, falling back, ranged themselves in a half circle
</p>
<p>outside of the gate. Those who had been with the
</p>
<p>soldiers, and who all wore concealed arms, closed

<p>And even there, his eye being big with tears,

<p>And, with affection wondrous sensible,

<p>SHAKSPEARE.
</p>
<p>AT daylight, all was in motion. Arthur and Vir
</p>
<p>ginia, being affectionately dismissed by their friends,
</p>
<p>were first upon the road, before Lieutenant Whiting
</p>
<p>was awake. Much of the night had been spent in
</p>
<p>preparations, and long before sunrise Douglas handed
</p>
<p>his aunt and cousins into their carriage. His uncle
</p>
<p>mounted the barouche, with Jack for driver, by whose
</p>
<p>side old Tom was placed; while the lady s maid
</p>
<p>took her seat by her single-minded master, with a
</p>
<p>freedom from which an amalgamationist would have
</p>
<p>drawn the most pleasing inferences. No other white

<p>person was seen ; but a body-guard of twenty negroes,
</p>
<p>well armed, and mounted on plough horses, some
</p>
<p>saddled, some cushioned, and some barebacked,
</p>
<p>surrounded the carriages and baggage- wagon. In

<p>the midst rode Douglas and his friend on horseback.

</p>
<p>faithful creatures took in last night s work, drives
</p>
<p>them into exile as well as me. I must not leave
</p>
<p>them behind to be the victims of baffled malice.
</p>
<p>What is to become of rny plantation, is a question
</p>
<p>of less importance. I suppose I may say with Cin-
</p>
<p>cinnatus, when honor was forced on him as it is on
</p>
<p>me, rny fields must go un tilled this year ! You see
</p>
<p>here, sir, my whole male force. Not one proved
</p>
<p>recreant.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;This affair is altogether unaccountable to me,&quot;
</p>
<p>said Whiting to Douglas, as they moved off toge
</p>
<p>ther ; &quot;and this the strangest feature of the whole.
</p>
<p>Do men, then, act without motives ; and against all
</p>
<p>assignable motives ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I asked the same question myself last night,&quot;
</p>
<p>said Douglas, &quot;and was referred to coming events
</p>
<p>for the answer. I was partly taught, at the same
</p>
<p>time, to account for what I was told to expect.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And how can it be accounted for?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say I have my lesson perfect; but some
</p>
<p>thing was said about the difference of character pro
</p>
<p>duced by peculiar training, and habitudes of mind
</p>
<p>formed by circumstances. For my part, it appears
</p>
<p>to me that there must be something, by nature, in
</p>
<p>the moral constitution of the negro, intrinsically dif
</p>
<p>ferent from the white man.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It would, indeed, seem so,&quot; said Whiting, &quot;if
</p>
<p>we are to credit what we see. But, in that case, we
</p>
<p>must reject the authority which tells us that all are of

</p>
<p>&quot; So are all dogs,&quot; said Douglas ; &quot; and dogs can
</p>
<p>no more act without motive than man. It depends
</p>
<p>on temper and character what shall be motives of
</p>
<p>action. The wolf would be sadly puzzled to judge
</p>
<p>of the motives of the Newfoundland dog. May not
</p>
<p>circumstances, which have made the difference be
</p>
<p>tween them, have produced the much less difference
</p>
<p>between the white man and the negro ? I have no
</p>
<p>measure for the effect of such causes. If am put
</p>
<p>to choose between rejecting the evidence of my own-
</p>
<p>senses, or the evidence of God s word, or the philo
</p>
<p>sophy which teaches that man is to be considered as
</p>
<p>a unit, because all of one race, philosophy must go
</p>
<p>by the board. It may be that what is best for me is
</p>
<p>best for my friend Jack there, and vice versa; but as
</p>
<p>long as neither of us thinks so, why not leave each
</p>
<p>to his choice? Besides, there is more room in the
</p>
<p>world for both of us, than if both always wanted the
</p>
<p>same things.&quot;
</p>
<p>A ride of a few hours carried the party across the
</p>
<p>line into North Carolina. Here they stopped at the
</p>
<p>first public-house; arid Mr. Trevor drew up a hasty
</p>
<p>statement of the events of the night, which should
</p>
<p>have the effect of acquitting Lieutenant Whiting of
</p>
<p>all blame, on account of his own escape from the
</p>
<p>fangs of his enemies. In this he set forth that,
</p>
<p>having been warned of the intended prosecution, he
</p>
<p>had made his preparations accordingly, and that the
</p>
<p>officer had but fallen into a snare from which no

</p>
<p>and gave, moreover, a clear acquittance to Lieutenant
</p>
<p>Whiting for all he had done; and having thus placed
</p>
<p>him, as far as depended on himself, rectus in curia,
</p>
<p>he announced to him that he was now at liberty to
</p>
<p>go whither he would.
</p>
<p>&quot;And now, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;as the spell which
</p>
<p>would have made your touch degrading is broken
</p>
<p>by the State line, let me have the pleasure of taking
</p>
<p>you by the hand, not only as my nephew s friend,
</p>
<p>but as one who, in the extremes of victory and de
</p>
<p>feat, as captor and as prisoner, has borne himself as
</p>
<p>became a gentleman.&quot;
</p>
<p>Saying this, he extended his hand, which Whiting
</p>
<p>grasped with fervor, and they parted as friends
</p>
<p>cordial and sincere.
</p>
<p>Douglas accompanied his friend a short distance
</p>
<p>on his return, the latter walking, and leading his
</p>
<p>horse. They conversed of the past and the future.
</p>
<p>&quot; I have been a volunteer in this business,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Whiting. &quot;I shall not disguise that my friendship
</p>
<p>for you led me to offer my services, and I fear that
</p>
<p>no excuse will be received for my failure. There is
</p>
<p>a spirit somewhere at work, to which I will give no
</p>
<p>name, that will be implacable at the thought that any
</p>
<p>advantage may have been lost by my respect for your
</p>
<p>feelings.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am afraid it may prove so,&quot; replied Douglas.

<p>&quot; The consequence may be fatal to your advancement

<p>in the army, and perhaps you may be driven from it,

<p>The Partisan Leader. 227
</p>
<p>but I will not profit so little by the example of
</p>
<p>delicacy set me while I wore the epaulette, as to say
</p>
<p>any thing to you now. I would content myself with
</p>
<p>telling you where I shall be found, if I myself knew.
</p>
<p>But shall I keep you advised of my movements?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;By all means,&quot; said Whiting. &quot; I shall always
</p>
<p>wish to know your fate, whether good or ill.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I know that,&quot; replied Douglas. &quot;But that is
</p>
<p>not my meaning. Shall I let you know where to
</p>
<p>find me, in case circumstances should lead you to
</p>
<p>share my fate ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Don t ask me that, Trevor. The question implies
</p>
<p>ideas which I must not entertain. But should such a
</p>
<p>time as you suppose ever arrive, I shall know where to
</p>
<p>find you, should my opinions make it right to seek you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Then, God bless you, Whiting ! That we shall
</p>
<p>meet again is sure. That we shall stand shoulder to
</p>
<p>shoulder in the strife of battle, as, in our day dreams,
</p>
<p>we have so often thought of doing, I cannot doubt.&quot;
</p>
<p>And thus parted these gallant and generous youths ;
</p>
<p>the one into exile from the country that he loved, the
</p>
<p>other to return to the service of an unthankful master.
</p>
<p>A farther ride of a few miles brought our party to
</p>
<p>the village, in which Mr. Trevor wished to take up
</p>
<p>his temporary residence. Here he found Mr. B ,
</p>
<p>who had been engaged in investigating the comforts
</p>
<p>and capabilities of the different public-houses, and
</p>
<p>having fixed on that he liked best, met Mr. Trevor
</p>
<p>in the street, and conducted the party to it. The

<p>two friends soon drew apart to discuss with the land-
</p>
<p>228 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>lord the necessary arrangements for the comfort of
</p>
<p>the family during their proposed stay.
</p>
<p>While they were thus engaged, Douglas seated
</p>
<p>himself, after the manner of the country, in the bar
</p>
<p>room, in which, besides some travellers, there was a
</p>
<p>motley assemblage of the inhabitants of the village,
</p>
<p>who had come in to stare at and talk about the new
</p>
<p>comers. By the time Douglas had taken care of the
</p>
<p>ladies and baggage, they were deep into the merits
</p>
<p>of the whole party ; and, when he entered the room,
</p>
<p>they were too busy talking to pay any attention to
</p>
<p>him. The principal interlocutors were three. First,
</p>
<p>a well-dressed, middle-aged man, whose dapper air
</p>
<p>and delicate hands bespoke one accustomed to bow
</p>
<p>ing across a counter over lace patterns and painted
</p>
<p>muslins ; and whose style of eloquence was exactly
</p>
<p>adapted to the praise of such articles. Then there
</p>
<p>was a, coarse, strong man, with a bacon-fed look,
</p>
<p>plainly, cheaply, and un tastefully dressed, in clothes
</p>
<p>which, by their substantial goodness, indicated at
</p>
<p>once the wearer s prudence, and the length of his
</p>
<p>purse. His voice was loud, strong, and self-im
</p>
<p>portant, entirely devoid of melody, and incapable of
</p>
<p>inflection or modulation. His whole appearance
</p>
<p>showed him to be a substantial planter, ignorant of
</p>
<p>every thing but corn and tobacco. A huge whip in
</p>
<p>the hand of the third, together with his dusty and
</p>
<p>travel-soiled appearance, denoted the driver of a
</p>
<p>wagon which stood before the door.

<p>If she be not kind to me,
</p>
<p>What care I how kind she be ? SUCKLING.
</p>
<p>&quot; I CANNOT say I like it altogether, Squire,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the planter. &quot; It may suit my neighbor Jones, here,
</p>
<p>well enough to have one of them high-headed Roa-
</p>
<p>noke planters to come here with his family, and spend
</p>
<p>his money. I dare say he will make a pretty good
</p>
<p>spec out of them ; but, for my part, I would rather
</p>
<p>they would stay at home, and live under their own
</p>
<p>laws. I ha nt got no notion, after they saddled that
</p>
<p>damned rascal Yan Buren upon us so long, that now,
</p>
<p>the minute we have shook him off and made a good
</p>
<p>government, and good treaties, and all, they should
</p>
<p>be wanting to have a sop in our pan. If that s what
</p>
<p>they are after, in rebelling against their government,
</p>
<p>I don t want to give them no countenance. What
</p>
<p>we have done, we have done for ourselves, and we
</p>
<p>have a right to all the good of it. They have fixed
</p>
<p>their market to their liking,- and let it stand so. If
</p>
<p>we can get thirty dollars for our tobacco, and they
</p>
<p>cannot get ten, I reckon we ha nt got nobody to thank

</p>
<p>for it but ourselves. I dare say, now they see how
</p>
<p>230 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>the thing works, they would be glad enough to share
</p>
<p>with us, but I see plain enough that all they would
</p>
<p>get by joining us, we would lose, and may be more
</p>
<p>too.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You are right there, Mr. Hobson,&quot; said the mer
</p>
<p>chant; &quot;and that is not all. There s an advantage
</p>
<p>in buying as well as selling. Now as to this Mr.
</p>
<p>Trevor, or whatever his name is, coming over here,
</p>
<p>and buying things cheaper than he could get them
</p>
<p>at home why that he is welcome to. Though you
</p>
<p>may be sure, neighbor, I don t let him have them as
</p>
<p>cheap as I sell to you. But as to letting in the Nor
</p>
<p>folk merchants to all the advantage of our treaty
</p>
<p>with England, that is another matter. For though,
</p>
<p>when we deepen the bar at Ocracock, I have no
</p>
<p>doubt our town down there will be another sort of a
</p>
<p>place to what Norfolk ever was, yet if Virginia was
</p>
<p>to join us now, right away, the most of the trade
</p>
<p>would go to Norfolk again, and they would get their
</p>
<p>goods there as cheap as we get them here, and may
</p>
<p>be a little cheaper. So you see it is against my
</p>
<p>interest as well as yours ; and I don t like the
</p>
<p>thoughts of putting in a crop, and letting another
</p>
<p>man gather it, any more than you do.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It would be harder upon me than any of you,&quot;
</p>
<p>isaid the wagoner ; &quot; for if that was the case, that
</p>
<p>damned railroad would break up my business, stock
</p>
<p>and fluke. As it is, there never was such a time for
</p>
<p>wagoning before. Instead of just hauling the little

<p>tobacco that is made here to the end of the railroad,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 231
</p>
<p>now I have the hauling of the Virginia tobacco, and
</p>
<p>all, down to Commerce&quot;*
</p>
<p>It is hard to say whether surprise or disgust most
</p>
<p>prevailed in the mind of Douglas at hearing these
</p>
<p>ro marks. The idea of the advantages lost to Vir
</p>
<p>ginia, by her connexion with the North, had never
</p>
<p>entered his mind ; but still less had he conceived it
</p>
<p>possible that a sordid desire to monopolize these
</p>
<p>advantages, could stifle, in the minds of the North
</p>
<p>Carolinians, every feeling of sympathy with the
</p>
<p>oppressed and persecuted assertors of the rights of
</p>
<p>Virginia. The reply of Mr. Hobson to the remark
</p>
<p>of the wagoner gave him a yet deeper insight into
</p>
<p>that dark and foul corner of the human heart, where
</p>
<p>self predominates over all the better affections.
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t think that s right fair in you wagoners,&quot;
</p>
<p>said he. &quot;You haul the Virginian tobacco down to
</p>
<p>Commerce, and when it gets there it is all the same
</p>
<p>as mine. Now, if it was not for that, I am not so
</p>
<p>mighty sure but I d get forty dollars instead of
</p>
<p>thirty ; and I don t like to lose ten dollars to give
</p>
<p>you a chance to get one.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It is all one to me,&quot; said the wagoner. &quot; You
</p>
<p>* The reader will look, in vain, on the map, for the name of this
</p>
<p>place. It was somewhere on the waters of the Sound, and, doubt
</p>
<p>less, would have become a place of some consequpnce, had not the
</p>
<p>union of Virginia to the Southern Confederacy laid the foundation for
</p>
<p>a degree of prosperity in Norfolk, which bids fair to make it the first
</p>
<p>city on the continent. The town of Commerce, of course, went down

</p>
<p>may just pay rne the same for not hauling that they
</p>
<p>pay me for hauling, or only half as much, and I will
</p>
<p>not haul another hogshead.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But if you won t, another will,&quot; said Hobson.
</p>
<p>&quot; Like enough,&quot; replied the wagoner ; &quot; for all
</p>
<p>trades must live ; and if them poor devils get a
</p>
<p>chance to sell a hogshead or two, instead of
</p>
<p>leaving it all to rot, you ought not to grudge them
</p>
<p>that.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Certainly not,&quot; said the merchant, &quot; for I guess
</p>
<p>that whatever they get, they take care to lay it all
</p>
<p>out in goods on this side of the line. So the money
</p>
<p>stays with us after all, and friend Stubbs s hauling
</p>
<p>does good to more besides him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I see,&quot; said Hobson, &quot; how it does good to you,
</p>
<p>but none to me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But that an t all, Mr. Hobson,&quot; said the landlord,
</p>
<p>who had entered while this conversation was going
</p>
<p>on. &quot; Them hot-headed fellows over the line there,
</p>
<p>like this old Squire Trevor, will be getting them
</p>
<p>selves into hot water every now and then ; and when
</p>
<p>they run away and come to us, if they did not bring
</p>
<p>no money, we d have to feed them free gratis for
</p>
<p>nothing. Now Stubbs hauls Squire Trevor s to
</p>
<p>bacco to Commerce, and he gets a good price ; and
</p>
<p>then he gets into trouble, and comes over here to
</p>
<p>stay with me, and so he is able to pay me a good
</p>
<p>price ; and here it is,&quot; added he, showing a roll of
</p>
<p>notes.

</p>
<p>&quot; Still,&quot; said Hobson, &quot; 1 don t see how that does
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 233
</p>
<p>me any good. If they were to come here begging,
</p>
<p>damn the mouthful I d give them.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Then you would leave the whole burden on the
</p>
<p>poor tavern-keepers,&quot; said the landlord.
</p>
<p>&quot; No I would not. I would not let them come ;
</p>
<p>or, if they did, just give them up to their own go
</p>
<p>vernment. If they had not a chance to be running
</p>
<p>over here, as soon as they got into trouble, they
</p>
<p>would keep quiet, and never get a chance to sepa
</p>
<p>rate, and so ruin our business, whether they joined
</p>
<p>us or no.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Old Rip is wide awake at last,&quot; said a voice
</p>
<p>from behind ; u but it is to his interest only.&quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas turned to the voice of the speaker, the
</p>
<p>tone of which expressed a scorn and derision most
</p>
<p>acceptable to his feelings. He was a tall and fine-
</p>
<p>looking man, powerfully made, and inclined to be
</p>
<p>fat, but not at all unwieldy. The half laughing
</p>
<p>expression of his large, blue eye, and the protrusion
</p>
<p>of his under lip, spoke his careless contempt of those
</p>
<p>whose conversation had called forth his sarcasm.
</p>
<p>The attention of the whole company was drawn to
</p>
<p>him at the same moment ; all looking as if they
</p>
<p>wished to say something, without knowing what.
</p>
<p>At length the wagoner spoke, on the well under
</p>
<p>stood principle that, when men talk of what they
</p>
<p>understand imperfectly, he who knows least should
</p>
<p>be always first to show his ignorance.

<p>mean, stranger,&quot; said he ; &quot; but I guess, by the cut
</p>
<p>234 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>of your jib, that you are one of them high dons from
</p>
<p>South Carolina, that always have money to throw
</p>
<p>away, and think a body ought never to care any
</p>
<p>more for himself than another. But this business
</p>
<p>don t consarn you, no how, because these people
</p>
<p>don t interfere with your cotton crop.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Yes, but they do, though,&quot; said Hobson ; &quot; for
</p>
<p>if they drive me from tobacco, I shall make cotton.
</p>
<p>But, if I can keep them out of the tobacco market,
</p>
<p>I shall be willing to give up the making of cotton to
</p>
<p>South Carolina.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, that is true,&quot; said the stranger, with a
</p>
<p>sudden change of his countenance, from which he
</p>
<p>discharged, in a moment, every appearance of intel
</p>
<p>ligence, but that which seemed to reflect the superior
</p>
<p>wisdom of Mr. Hobson. &quot; That is true,&quot; said he,
</p>
<p>looking as if making a stupid attempt to think ; &quot; I
</p>
<p>had not thought of that before.&quot;
</p>
<p>As he said this, he sunk slowly and thoughtfully
</p>
<p>into a chair, his knees falling far asunder, his arms
</p>
<p>dropping across his thighs, his body bent forward,
</p>
<p>and his face turned up toward Mr. Hobson, with
</p>
<p>the look of one who desires and expects to receive
</p>
<p>important information. The whole action spoke so
</p>
<p>eloquently to Mr. Hobson s self-esteem, that he went
</p>
<p>on, with an air of the most gracious complacency.
</p>
<p>&quot; You see, stranger, just shutting only a part of
</p>
<p>the Virginian tobacco out of the market, makes a
</p>
<p>difference of ten dollars, at the very least, in the

</p>
<p>price of mine. Now, we used to make a heap of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 235
</p>
<p>cotton in this country, hut we are all going to give
</p>
<p>it up quite entirely, and then, you see, it stands to
</p>
<p>reason it will make a difference of five cents a pound,
</p>
<p>or may be ten, in your cotton.&quot;
</p>
<p>This interesting proposition was received by the
</p>
<p>stranger with a sluggish start of dull surprise, from
</p>
<p>which he sunk again into the same appearance of
</p>
<p>stolid musing. &quot;To think what a fool I have been,&quot;
</p>
<p>said he, after a long pause. Then, scratching his
</p>
<p>head, and twisting in his chair, he added : &quot; You are
</p>
<p>right. You are right ; and the only way to manage
</p>
<p>the matter is to get your Legislature to pass a law,
</p>
<p>as you say, to make those fellows stay at home.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; To be sure it would,&quot; said the gratified Hobson ;
</p>
<p>&quot; but then there are so many conceited fellows in the
</p>
<p>Legislature, with a fool s notion in their heads about
</p>
<p>taking sides with them that cannot help themselves,
</p>
<p>that there is no getting anything done.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; said the stranger, &quot; this gentleman guessed
</p>
<p>right when he said I was from South Carolina. So
</p>
<p>I don t know any thing about your laws here. But
</p>
<p>I suppose you have no law to hurt a man for taking
</p>
<p>up one that runs away from the law in Virginia, and
</p>
<p>carrying him back. I expect old Van would pay
</p>
<p>well for them.&quot;
</p>
<p>Hobson looked hard at the stranger, and only
</p>
<p>answered with that compound motion of the head,
</p>
<p>which, partaking at once of a shake and a nod,
</p>
<p>expresses both assent and caution.

</p>
<p>this suggestion, the one illustrating his argument by

<p>the freedom with which his guest had ordered wine

<p>withdrawn since the revolution. Among the bystand

<p>of silence which betokens an idea that what has been

</p>
<p>IN the meantime, Mr. B had entered the room,
</p>
<p>and, hearing the stranger s voice, placed himself at
</p>
<p>the back of his chair, looking on with a playful
</p>
<p>smile. He now spoke
</p>
<p>&quot; Have you played out the play ?&quot; said he.
</p>
<p>The stranger sprang to his feet in a moment, and,
</p>
<p>facing B , caught him by the hand, which he
</p>
<p>shook with an energy which seemed to threaten dis
</p>
<p>location. The two then turned off, and left the room
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>&quot;This is most fortunate, my dear sir,&quot; said the

<p>About what? I came this far to see you both, and

<p>conversation of those fellows, in hopes to find some

</p>
<p>238 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; Here we botli are,&quot; said B , &quot; and here Tre
</p>
<p>vor is like to remain for a while. He has been
</p>
<p>elected to the Legislature, and they have gotten up
</p>
<p>a prosecution against him before that iniquitous
</p>
<p>court of high commission at &quot;Washington, to hang
</p>
<p>him, if they can, or at least to drive him off.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Can you think him safe here,&quot; asked the stranger,
</p>
<p>&quot; among such mercenary wretches as those we have
</p>
<p>just left?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; O yes ! You must not judge of this people by
</p>
<p>those muck- worms. The best of the three is a Yan
</p>
<p>kee tin-pedler, turned merchant. The other two are
</p>
<p>the worst specimens of their respective species. I
</p>
<p>dare say there are many more like them, but there

<p>are fifty gentlemen of property in this county who
</p>
<p>would stand by us; and are ready, in their indivi

<p>dual capacity, to aid us with purse and sword, when

<p>ever we raise our banner.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But where is Trevor?&quot; said the stranger. &quot;I
</p>
<p>am impatient to see him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; We will go to him,&quot; said B ; &quot; but first let
</p>
<p>me introduce you to a young friend of ours, whom

</p>
<p>Douglas was now called into the room, and intro
</p>
<p>duced to the stranger ; and the three gentlemen re
</p>
<p>paired together to the parlor of Mr. Trevor. A
</p>
<p>cordial greeting between the two friends, and a
</p>
<p>sprightly conversation on various topics, ensued ; but
</p>
<p>at length the ladies left the room, and affairs of mo
</p>
<p>ment came under discussion.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am come,&quot; said the stranger, &quot; to learn your
</p>
<p>plans, and to consult of the best means of affording
</p>
<p>such aid as we can. When, where, and how, do you
</p>
<p>mean to move?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; We have carried the elections,&quot; said B , &quot; so
</p>
<p>as to be sure of a majority in the Legislature, if they
</p>
<p>can be freed from the presence of the Federal army.
</p>
<p>But, unless that can be done, our friends here, and
</p>
<p>many others, will not be permitted to attend, and the
</p>
<p>weaker brethren will be overawed.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Of course, then, you will attempt that. What
</p>
<p>measures do you propose to take ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; None that shall attract observation,&quot; said B .
</p>
<p>&quot; It is impossible, at this time, to draw together any
</p>
<p>force which might not at once be overwhelmed by
</p>
<p>the army at Richmond. We are, therefore, obliged
</p>
<p>to lie quiet, and suffer our people to see for them
</p>
<p>selves the advantages they are losing. They are
</p>
<p>beginning to understand this. They perceive that
</p>
<p>your commercial arrangements are making their
</p>
<p>neighbors in this State rich, while they can sell

<p>nothing that they make, and are obliged to give

</p>
<p>duty in the English ports on your tobacco, and the
</p>
<p>corresponding abatement of your impost on British
</p>
<p>manufactures, is driving trade, money, and even
</p>
<p>population, to the South ; and nothing but separa
</p>
<p>tion from the northern States can prevent our whole
</p>
<p>tobacco country from being deserted. This, of course,
</p>
<p>will open the eyes of the people in time, and we
</p>
<p>hope, that when the Legislature meets, it may be
</p>
<p>practicable to draw together, on the sudden, such a
</p>
<p>force as may drive the enemy from Richmond, and
</p>
<p>give time at least to adjourn to a place where they
</p>
<p>may deliberate in safety.
</p>
<p>&quot; Is there any such place in the State ?&quot; asked the
</p>
<p>stranger.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not aware that there is at this moment, but
</p>
<p>such a one must be provided for the emergency,
</p>
<p>should it arise.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And what means do you propose to use for that
</p>
<p>purpose ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; There is a section of the State,&quot; replied B ,
</p>
<p>&quot; where circumstances enable me to exert a powerful
</p>
<p>influence, and where, from its localities, a partisan
</p>
<p>corps might maintain itself, in spite of the enemy,
</p>
<p>and might give so decided a disposition to the sur
</p>
<p>rounding population, as to establish perfect security
</p>
<p>within a pretty extensive district.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But is there no danger,&quot; said the southron,
</p>
<p>&quot; that such a corps would induce an increase of the
</p>
<p>force at Richmond and elsewhere, and so make the

</p>
<p>&quot; It would have that effect,&quot; said B , u were
</p>
<p>not the scene of action remote from Richmond, and
</p>
<p>unless the operations of the corps were so conducted
</p>
<p>as to create no alarm for that place. Of course,
</p>
<p>there should be no appearance of concert with this
</p>
<p>lower country ; and, so far from increasing appre
</p>
<p>hension of our ulterior designs, our failure to rally
</p>
<p>to the banner of a successful leader might disarm
</p>
<p>suspicion.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Then it seems that all you want is a Marion, a
</p>
<p>Sumpter, or a Pickens ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; We have such a one,&quot; said B ; &quot; and it is
</p>
<p>well that you are here with us to aid in consecrating
</p>
<p>him to his task. Here he stands.&quot;
</p>
<p>As he said this, he laid his hand, solemnly, gently,
</p>
<p>and respectfully, on the head of the astonished
</p>
<p>Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; What, I ! &quot; exclaimed he. &quot; For God s sake, my

<p>supposes the absence of all legal authority ?&quot;

<p>but the most important considerations could ius

</p>
<p>&quot; All that you have a right to ask, and are bound
</p>
<p>to understand clearly. You would have understood
</p>
<p>it long before this, but that as long as one shred
</p>
<p>remained of the tie that bound you to the army of the
</p>
<p>United States, a delicate respect to you imposed
</p>
<p>silence on your uncle and myself. You now require
</p>
<p>that we show you some prevailing reason why Vir
</p>
<p>ginia should detach herself from the Northern Con
</p>
<p>federacy, and either form a separate State, which we
</p>
<p>do not propose, or unite herself to the South, which
</p>
<p>we do. Is not that your difficulty ! &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It is,&quot; replied Douglas. &quot; I have long been
</p>
<p>sensible that there were views of the subject which
</p>
<p>my situation had hidden from me, and have fre
</p>
<p>quently lamented (while I was grateful for) the reso
</p>
<p>lute reserve which my friends have maintained.
</p>
<p>&quot; You must be sensible,&quot; said B , &quot; that the
</p>
<p>southern States, including Virginia, are properly and
</p>
<p>almost exclusively agricultural. The quality of their
</p>
<p>soil and climate, and the peculiar character of their
</p>
<p>laboring population, concur to make agriculture the
</p>
<p>most profitable employment among them. Apart
</p>
<p>from the influence of artificial causes, it is not- cer
</p>
<p>tain that any labor can be judiciously taken from
</p>
<p>the soil to be applied to any other object whatever.

<p>true and judicious friend of the colonies. The labor
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 243
</p>
<p>necessary to make a hob-nail, if applied to the cul
</p>
<p>tivation of the earth, might produce that for which
</p>
<p>the British manufacturer would gladly give two hob
</p>
<p>nails. By coming between the manufacturer and
</p>
<p>the farmer, and interrupting this interchange by
</p>
<p>perverse legislation, the Government broke the tie
</p>
<p>which bound the colonies to the mother country.
</p>
<p>&quot; When that tie was severed and peace established,
</p>
<p>it was the interest of both parties that this interchange
</p>
<p>should be restored, and put upon such a footing as
</p>
<p>to enable each, reciprocally, to obtain for the pro
</p>
<p>ducts of his own labor as much as possible of the
</p>
<p>products of the labor of the other.
</p>
<p>&quot; Why was not this done ? Because laws are not
</p>
<p>made for the benefit of the people, but for that of
</p>
<p>their rulers. The monopolizing spirit of the landed
</p>
<p>aristocracy in England led to the exclusion of our
</p>
<p>bread-stuffs, and the necessities of the British trea
</p>
<p>sury tempted to the levying of enormous revenue from
</p>
<p>our other agricultural products. The interchange
</p>
<p>between the farmer and manufacturer was thus inter
</p>
<p>rupted. In part it was absolutely prevented ; the
</p>
<p>profit being swallowed up by the impost, the induce
</p>
<p>ment was taken away.
</p>
<p>&quot;What did the American Government under these
</p>
<p>circumstances ? Did they say to Great Britain, relax
</p>
<p>your corn-laws ; reduce your duties on tobacco ;
</p>
<p>make no discrimination between our cotton and that
</p>
<p>from the East Indies ; and we will refrain from lay.

<p>ing a high duty on your manufactures. You will
</p>
<p>244 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>thus enrich your own people, and it is by no means
</p>
<p>sure that their increased prosperity may not give
</p>
<p>you, through the excise and other channels of reve
</p>
<p>nue, more than an equivalent for the taxes we propose
</p>
<p>to you to withdraw.
</p>
<p>&quot; Did we say this ? No. And why ? Because,
</p>
<p>in the northern States, there was a manufacturing
</p>
<p>interest to be advanced by the very course of legis
</p>
<p>lation most fatal to the South. With a dense popu
</p>
<p>lation, occupying a small extent of barren country,
</p>
<p>with mountain streams tumbling into deep tide
</p>
<p>water, and bringing commerce to the aid of manu
</p>
<p>factures, they wanted nothing but a monopoly of the
</p>
<p>southern market to enable them to enrich themselves.
</p>
<p>The alternative was before us. To invite the great
</p>
<p>European manufacturer to reciprocate the benefits of
</p>
<p>free trade, whereby the South might enjoy all the
</p>
<p>advantages of its fertile soil and fine climate, or to
</p>
<p>transfer these advantages to the North, by meeting
</p>
<p>Great Britain on the ground of prohibition and
</p>
<p>exaction. The latter was preferred, because to the
</p>
<p>interest of that section, which, having the local
</p>
<p>majority, had the power.
</p>
<p>&quot; Under this system, Great Britain has never
</p>
<p>wanted a pretext for her corn-laws, and her high
</p>
<p>duties on all our products. Thus we sell all we
</p>
<p>make, subject to these deductions, which, in many
</p>
<p>instances, leave much less to us than what goes into
</p>
<p>the British treasury.

</p>
<p>&quot; Here, too, is the pretext to the Government of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 245
</p>
<p>the United States for their exactions in return. The
</p>
<p>misfortune is, that the southern planter had to bear
</p>
<p>both burthens. One half the price of his products is
</p>
<p>seized by the British Government, and half the
</p>
<p>value of what he gets for the other half is seized by
</p>
<p>the Government of the United States.
</p>
<p>&quot; This they called retaliation and indemnification.
</p>
<p>It was indemnifying an interest which had not been
</p>
<p>injured, by the farther injury of one which had been
</p>
<p>injured. It was impoverishing the South for the
</p>
<p>benefit of the North, to requite the South for having
</p>
<p>been already impoverished for the benefit of Gre&t
</p>
<p>Britain. Still it was indemnifying ourselves? Much
</p>
<p>virtue in that word, ourselves? It is the language
</p>
<p>used by the giant to the dwarf in the fable ; the
</p>
<p>language of the brazen pot to the earthen pot ; the
</p>
<p>language of all dangerous or interested friend
</p>
<p>ship.
</p>
<p>&quot; I remember seeing an illustration of this sort of
</p>
<p>indemnity in the case of a woman who was whipt by
</p>
<p>her husband. She went complaining to her father,
</p>
<p>who whipped her again, and sent her back. Tell
</p>
<p>your husband, said he, i that as often as he whips
</p>
<p>my daughter, I will whip his wife? 3:
</p>
<p>&quot; But what remedy has been proposed for these
</p>
<p>things ?&quot; asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; A remedy has been proposed and applied,&quot;

<p>replied B . Ci The remedy of legislation for the

<p>benefit, not of the rulers, but of the ruled.&quot;

<p>&quot; But in what sense will you say that our legisla-
</p>
<p>246 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>tion has been for the benefit of the rulers alone ?
</p>
<p>Are we not all our own rulers ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Yes,&quot; replied B , &quot; if you.again have recourse
</p>
<p>to the use of that comprehensive word WE, which
</p>
<p>identifies things most dissimilar, and binds up, in the
</p>
<p>same bundle, things most discordant. If the South
</p>
<p>and North are one ; if the Yankee and the Virginian
</p>
<p>are one ; if light and darkness, heat and cold, life
</p>
<p>and death, can all be identified ; then WE are our own
</p>
<p>rulers. Just so, if the State will consent to be iden
</p>
<p>tified with the Church, then we pay tithes with one
</p>
<p>Lund, and receive them with the other. While the
</p>
<p>Commons identify themselves with the Crown, SVE
</p>
<p>do but pay taxes to ourselves. And if Virginians
</p>
<p>can be fooled into identifying themselves with the
</p>
<p>Yankees a fixed tax-paying minority, with a fixed
</p>
<p>tax-receiving majority it will still be the same
</p>
<p>thing ; and they will continue to hold a distinguished
</p>
<p>place among the innumerable WES that have been
</p>
<p>gulled into their own ruin ever since the world
</p>
<p>began. It is owing to this sort of deception, played
</p>
<p>off on the unthinking multitude, that in the two
</p>
<p>freest countries in the world, the most important
</p>
<p>interests are taxed for the benefit of lesser interests.
</p>
<p>In England, a country of manufacturers, they have

<p>been starved that agriculture may thrive. In this,

<p>taxed that manufacturers may thrive. Now I will

<p>THE impression made on Douglas by these obser

<p>vations was so strong and so obvious, that his friend

<p>paused and left him to meditate upon them. Some

<p>&quot;You heard what passed in the bar-room, just

</p>
<p>advantages which these sons of Mammon are so

<p>anxious to monopolize? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Not at all, and hence my surprise; for I had sup
</p>
<p>posed heretofore, that, between the two States, all the

<p>advantage lay on the side of Virginia.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You judge rightly,&quot; replied the other. &quot; In the

<p>way of commerce, nature has done nothing for the

<p>one, and everything for the other. But the conversa

<p>chokes the waters of the Sound is a trivial obstacle, in
</p>
<p>comparison with the legislative barriers which have

<p>shut out prosperity from the noble Chesapeake.
</p>
<p>Look at your rivers and bay, and you will see that

<p>Virginia ought to be the most prosperous country in

<p>barren hills at high prices and coming South, where
</p>
<p>he might buy the fertile shores of the Chesapeake for
</p>
<p>a song ? No local attachment, certainly ; for his

</p>
<p>the planter of this neighborhood from exchanging his

<p>thirsty fields for the rich and long coveted low

<p>grounds of James Eiver, or Eoanoke, in Virginia?
</p>
<p>Are these people wiser, better, more energetic and

<p>your uncle s fault, that, were he now at home the

<p>&quot; I will answer that,&quot; said B ; &quot; because my
</p>
<p>friend s modesty might restrain him from giving the
</p>
<p>true answer. It has been &amp;lt;*btained by intelligence,
</p>
<p>manly frankness, and fair dealing. It has been

<p>favorable to their peculiar and distinctive interests,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 251
</p>
<p>in consideration of receiving the like advantage.
</p>
<p>Instead of nursing artificial interests to rival the iron
</p>
<p>and cotton fabrics, and the shipping of England, the
</p>
<p>wine of France, the silk and oil of Italy, and enviously
</p>
<p>snatching at whatever benefit nature may have vouch
</p>
<p>safed to other parts of the world, this people only ask
</p>
<p>to exchange for these things their own peculiar pro
</p>
<p>ductions. A trade perfectly free, totally discharged
</p>
<p>from all duties, would certainly be best for all. But
</p>
<p>revenue must be had, and the impost is the best
</p>
<p>source of revenue. No state can be expected to give
</p>
<p>that up. But it has been found practicable so to
</p>
<p>regulate that matter as to reduce the charges which
</p>
<p>have heretofore incumbered exchanges to a mere
</p>
<p>trifle.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;How has that been effected?&quot; asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; If that question were to be answered in detail,&quot;
</p>
<p>said B , &quot; I should leave the answer to him by
</p>
<p>whom the details have been arranged. I will give you
</p>
<p>the outline in a few words. These States were first
</p>
<p>driven to think of separation by a tariff of protection.
</p>
<p>Their federal constitution guards against it by ex
</p>
<p>press prohibition, and by requiring that the impost,
</p>
<p>like the tax laws of Virginia, should be annual.
</p>
<p>&quot; They have felt the danger to liberty from exces
</p>
<p>sive revenue. Their constitution requires that the
</p>
<p>estimates of the expense of the current year shall be
</p>
<p>made the measure of revenue to be raised for that
</p>
<p>year. The imports of the preceding year are taken

</p>
<p>as a basis of calculation, and credit being given for
</p>
<p>252 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>any surplus in the treasury, a tariff is laid which, on
</p>
<p>that basis, would produce the sum required.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Then there never can be any surplus for an
</p>
<p>emergency,&quot; said Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Always,&quot; replied B ; &quot; in the right place, and
</p>
<p>the only safe place the pockets of a prosperous pee
</p>
<p>pie. There is no place in the treasury to keep money.
</p>
<p>The till of the treasury has a hole in the bottom, and
</p>
<p>the money always finds its way into the pockets of
</p>
<p>sharpers, parasites, man-worshippers, and pseudo-
</p>
<p>patriots. But let that pass. You see that a small
</p>
<p>revenue alone will probably be wanting, and being
</p>
<p>raised annually, the tariff can be annually adjusted.
</p>
<p>&quot; Now, what says justice, as to the revenue to be
</p>
<p>raised by two nations on the trade between the two,
</p>
<p>seeing that it is equally levied on the citizens of both ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;On that hypothesis each should receive an equal
</p>
<p>share of it,&quot; said Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Precisely so,&quot; answered B ; &quot; and let these
</p>
<p>terms be held out to all nations, and if one will not
</p>
<p>accept them another will. On this principle a system
</p>
<p>of commercial arrangements has been set on foot
</p>
<p>which, by restoring to these States the benefit of
</p>
<p>their natural advantages, is at once producing an
</p>
<p>effect which explains their former prosperity. It
</p>
<p>places in stronger relief the evils of the opposite
</p>
<p>system to Virginia, and really leaves her, while she
</p>
<p>retains her present connexion with the North, with
</p>
<p>out any resource. Tobacco she cannot sell at all.

<p>Invita nat iira, she will have to raise cotton to supply
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 253
</p>
<p>the beggared manufactories of the North, from which
</p>
<p>she will not receive in return the third part as much
</p>
<p>of the manufactured article as the Carolina planter
</p>
<p>will get for his. This is her fate. She sees it, and
</p>
<p>would throw off the yoke. But her northern masters
</p>
<p>see it too. She is all that remains to them of their
</p>
<p>southern dependencies, which, though not their colo
</p>
<p>nies, they have so long governed as colonies. Take
</p>
<p>her away, and they are in the condition of the wolf
</p>
<p>when there are no sheep left. Wolf eat wolf, and
</p>
<p>Yankee cheat Yankee. This they will guard against
</p>
<p>by all means lawful and unlawful, for Virginia alone
</p>
<p>mitigates the ruin that their insatiate rapacity has
</p>
<p>brought upon them. They will hold on to her with
</p>
<p>the gripe of death ; and she must and will struggle to
</p>
<p>free herself, as from death.
</p>
<p>&quot; And now, how say you ? Are you prepared to
</p>
<p>do your part in furtherance of this object?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am,&quot; replied Douglas promptly ; &quot; and I now
</p>
<p>eagerly ask you to show me the means by which I can
</p>
<p>advance it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You asked for men,&quot; said B , &quot; and you shall
</p>
<p>have them. They are already provided, and want but
</p>
<p>a leader.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But what authority can I have to be recognised
</p>
<p>as such ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;You have heard your uncle, aunt, or cousins,

<p>speak of Jacob Schwartz.&quot;

</p>
<p>an ignorant clown ?&quot;
</p>
<p>254 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; He is all that,&quot; said B . &quot; But he writes as
</p>
<p>good a hand as Marshal Saxe, and has probably read
</p>
<p>as many books as Cincinnatus. But to speak seriously,
</p>
<p>he is no common clown. I picked him up, nearly
</p>
<p>forty years ago, a little, dirty, ragged boy, without
</p>
<p>money, without friends, without education, and with
</p>
<p>out principles. All these wants I found means to
</p>
<p>supply, except that of education, which to him would
</p>
<p>be quite superfluous. But he now has money suffi
</p>
<p>cient, and friends without number; and, what is bet
</p>
<p>ter still, he has become an honest man, and discharge?
</p>
<p>the duties of one none the worse for having had a
</p>
<p>pretty large experience in knavery. Such as he is, he
</p>
<p>is bound to me by gratitude, such as few men are
</p>
<p>capable of. More than a dozen years ago, he followed
</p>
<p>the bent of early habit, and retired to his native
</p>
<p>mountains, where he has married, and lives after the
</p>
<p>manner of the country, as if he were worth nothing in
</p>
<p>the world but his rifle. He has a good deal of money,
</p>
<p>which I manage for him ; and as he has no taste for
</p>
<p>extravagance of any sort, and is generous as a king,
</p>
<p>he always has a dollar to spare a friend.
</p>
<p>&quot; When I tell you that the people of that district
</p>
<p>see so little money that they always count it by four-
</p>
<p>pence-half-pennies, you will readily believe that a
</p>
<p>little help goes a great way. They don t see that
</p>
<p>Schwartz has any property ; but their opinion of his
</p>
<p>sagacity and enterprise takes away all wonder at the
</p>
<p>fact, that he is always able, as well as ready, to give

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>255
</p>
<p>infer, that his influence among them is very great.
</p>
<p>Now that, and all his faculties of body, mind, and
</p>
<p>purse, are at my command. He is aware of the state
</p>
<p>of public affairs ; adopts all my views, as far as he
</p>
<p>can understand them, and beyond that point trusts
</p>
<p>me implicitly. It is through his instrumentality that
</p>
<p>the minds of the mountaineers of that district are pre
</p>
<p>pared for action at this moment. No force is actually
</p>
<p>organized, but every thing is ready for the emer
</p>
<p>gency. The dispositions of the people, and the
</p>
<p>strong fastnesses of the country, will make it a secure
</p>
<p>retreat to a partisan corpus. The materials for such a
</p>
<p>corps may be found in part among the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>A nucleus is all that is wanting, and to that all the
</p>
<p>persecuted and distressed, from every quarter, will
</p>
<p>gather.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;You show me, then,&quot; said Douglas, &quot;that you
</p>
<p>already have all you want men and a leader. Your
</p>
<p>friend Schwartz must be the very man to command
</p>
<p>those fellows, and might not like to submit to the
</p>
<p>authority of another.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He is not the man to command,&quot; said B , &quot; be
</p>
<p>cause he could not keep up intelligence with other
</p>
<p>parts of the country, though as a medium of intelli
</p>
<p>gence there is none better. Indeed he cannot be
</p>
<p>spared from that branch of service. Besides, though
</p>
<p>he might command his neighbors, you will be joined
</p>
<p>by men who will not submit to be commanded by
</p>
<p>any but a gentleman. As to any reluctance on his

<p>CHAPTEE XXIX.
</p>
<p>The heath this night must be my bed,
</p>
<p>The bracken curtain for my head,
</p>
<p>My lullaby the warder s tread,
</p>
<p>Far, far, from Love and thee, Mary 1
</p>
<p>&quot;I THINK,&quot; said Douglas, &quot;I now understand your
</p>
<p>general purpose, and the means to be placed at my
</p>
<p>disposal. Let me now know your plan of operations.
</p>
<p>What am I to do, and when ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; The task I propose to myself,&quot; replied B , &quot; is
</p>
<p>one which requires that I keep myself out of harm s
</p>
<p>way, and free from all suspicion, until the time shall
</p>
<p>come ; when I propose to act a part which shall
</p>
<p>make me a conspicuous mark for the malice or policy
</p>
<p>of our enemies. Hence I affect to live, and keep
</p>
<p>myself as much as possible on this side of the line.
</p>
<p>What you do there must be done in such a way as to
</p>
<p>indicate no connexion with me. I therefore propose
</p>
<p>that you accompany my friend here to South Caro
</p>
<p>lina, where you may derive much benefit from seeing
</p>
<p>the first men in that State, with whom he will make
</p>
<p>you acquainted. From thence I would have you
</p>
<p>address letters to your friends (especially those in the

</p>
<p>258 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>change of opinions (which should be made to seem
</p>
<p>progressive) to the influence of these new associations.
</p>
<p>A few weeks will be sufficient for this purpose, and
</p>
<p>you may return to Virginia early in the summer.
</p>
<p>Here,&quot; continued B , pointing to a map which
</p>
<p>hung in the room, &quot; is the point at which you will
</p>
<p>enter the State, and here will be the principal scene
</p>
<p>of your operations. You will there find Schwartz,
</p>
<p>to whom you shall be properly accredited, and from
</p>
<p>whom you will learn the resources to be placed at
</p>
<p>your command, and the capabilities of the country.
</p>
<p>&quot; Now observe. Our object is to organize a small
</p>
<p>force, under which the district may be protected in
</p>
<p>declaring for the Independence of Virginia, and pre
</p>
<p>pared to afford a place of refuge to the Legislature,
</p>
<p>should they be driven from Eichmond, before they
</p>
<p>have time to organize the operations of the Govern
</p>
<p>ment. Of course, they must have an opportunity to
</p>
<p>assemble there, if but for a day. This it must be
</p>
<p>our care to secure, by a sudden movement from the
</p>
<p>midland counties on the southern boundary, and in
</p>
<p>this we may need your co-operation. On that point
</p>
<p>we shall take care to keep you advised.
</p>
<p>&quot; IsTow our first object being to free Eichmond
</p>
<p>from the presence of the federal army, at the moment
</p>
<p>the Legislature is to meet, we must be careful to
</p>
<p>cause no alarm for the safety of that place. Any
</p>
<p>movement in that direction would produce a concen
</p>
<p>tration of force there, and increase our difficulties.

</p>
<p>You should, therefore, be careful so to shape your
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 259
</p>
<p>operations as rather to call the attention of the enemy
</p>
<p>to other points ; and if you can make them of suffi
</p>
<p>cient importance to draw detachments from Kichmond,
</p>
<p>a double purpose will be answered. You will have
</p>
<p>no cause to fear any force that can be brought against
</p>
<p>you. Your field of operations affords situations which
</p>
<p>may defy assault, and, the line of North Carolina
</p>
<p>being at your back, you may, at any moment, cross
</p>
<p>it and disband for a time.
</p>
<p>&quot; But I am not sure whether our end may not be
</p>
<p>answered best by giving to all your operations such
</p>
<p>a character as may exclude the idea of any political
</p>
<p>object. As none of those who are conspicuous as
</p>
<p>malcontents in the lower country will join you, this
</p>
<p>deception will not be difficult. In beating up the
</p>
<p>quarters of the troops near you, you may seem to act
</p>
<p>but in self defence ; and should you extend your
</p>
<p>blow so far as Lynchburg, your mountaineers will
</p>
<p>hardly fail to levy such contributions on the camp-
</p>
<p>followers and Yankee pedlars there (who call them
</p>
<p>selves merchants), as to give the measure the appear
</p>
<p>ance of a mere marauding expedition.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I am not so very sure,&quot; replied Douglas, &quot;that
</p>
<p>I should like to mix my little reputation as a soldier
</p>
<p>and a gentleman with an affair of that sort.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I am not suggesting anything contrary to the
</p>
<p>laws of war,&quot; said B . &quot; The violation of them
</p>
<p>would be but in appearance. Care would be taken
</p>
<p>to indemnify any who might be wronged, whenever

<p>it shall be expedient for you to throw off the mask.

<p>260 The Partisan Leadei
</p>
<p>As to any temporary misconstruction, your name
</p>
<p>would connect you with your uncle, and, through
</p>
<p>him, with me and all our friends ; and moreover,
</p>
<p>would whet the malice of your worthy friends, the
</p>
<p>Bakers, who would move heaven and earth to circum
</p>
<p>vent you. Better, therefore, to drop the last name.
</p>
<p>Archibald Douglas is name enough to satisfy the ambi
</p>
<p>tion of any reasonable man, at least until he can cap it
</p>
<p>with a yet more honorable addition, if that be possible.&quot;
</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on, there was
</p>
<p>some appearance of embarrassment about Douglas,
</p>
<p>which did not escape the observation of his uncle.
</p>
<p>At length he said to him, in an under tone, that,
</p>
<p>before carrying the matter under discussion any far
</p>
<p>ther, he would be glad to have a few words with him
</p>
<p>in private.
</p>
<p>&quot; I understand your wish,&quot; said the old gentleman,
</p>
<p>aloud ; &quot; it shall be indulged.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I suspect you mistake me,&quot; said Douglas, coloring
</p>
<p>very high.
</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied the other. &quot;You only
</p>
<p>suppose so because you do not know that one
</p>
<p>of my friends here received his wife in marriage
</p>
<p>at my hands, and that the other stood father to
</p>
<p>mine. Hence I have no such reserves with them
</p>
<p>as you may suppose. Now, do I understand you ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I dare say you do,&quot; replied Douglas, blushing
</p>
<p>yet more deeply.
</p>
<p>&quot; Then I say, again, your wish shall be indulged.

<p>You shall not leave us until you are fully established
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 261
</p>
<p>in all the rights which it is mine to confer. But you
</p>
<p>must suppress your raptures until you hear the con
</p>
<p>ditions. Our plan requires secrecy, and, above all,
</p>
<p>that there should be no appearance of concert between
</p>
<p>you and us, and no cause to suspect it. This thing,
</p>
<p>therefore, must be absolutely private ; no witnesses
</p>
<p>but those here present, and your aunt, and Lucia ; and
</p>
<p>in the next moment your foot must be in the stirrup.
</p>
<p>Are you content ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Content ! &quot; said Douglas. a Indeed I am not ;
</p>
<p>but I see that you are acting upon a concerted plan,
</p>
<p>and that all expostulation must be vain. Let me at
</p>
<p>least see Delia now.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I suspect she has gone to bed,&quot; said Mr. T .
</p>
<p>&quot; Retired ! I believe is the word introduced by our
</p>
<p>Yankee school-mistresses, whose prurient imagina
</p>
<p>tions are shocked at the name of a bed. Poor girl,
</p>
<p>she was glad to retire, in the plain English sense of
</p>
<p>the word, as soon as we got here, and, I dare say, has
</p>
<p>been in bed half an hour. She and your aunt were
</p>
<p>on active service all last night, while you were keep
</p>
<p>ing a snoring watch over our friend Whiting. Come,
</p>
<p>my boy ! You shall not infect her with the fever of
</p>
<p>your brain to-night. If you cannot sleep, it is no
</p>
<p>reason why she should not. And now let us turn
</p>
<p>again to other matters.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; The next question, then,&quot; said the southron, &quot; is
</p>
<p>how we can aid you ? By sword, or tongue, or pen,
</p>
<p>or purse ? &quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; Our young friend here will need a small military
</p>
<p>chest, which we have no means of filling. As to the
</p>
<p>rest, keep out of the scrape. We wish to join you
</p>
<p>in peace, and then remain at peace, which will not
</p>
<p>be, if you strike a blow in our behalf now. As much
</p>
<p>individual aid as you please to our rendezvous just
</p>
<p>before the first Monday in December. A thousand
</p>
<p>independent volunteers, pour le coup, would be wel

<p>come. In the meantime, if you can send our young
</p>
<p>friend here a promising young officer from your
</p>
<p>military school, to be his second in command, it is

<p>all we would ask. Of course he will come as of his

</p>
<p>Many other topics connected with our subject were
</p>
<p>discussed, but I deem it unadvisable to speak of
</p>
<p>more than is necessary to explain the subsequent
</p>
<p>situation of the parties. When they met again at
</p>
<p>breakfast, the swimming eye and changing cheek of

<p>Delia told that she had been, made acquainted with
</p>
<p>all that had passed. The countenance of Douglas
</p>
<p>beamed with high excitement, at once pleasant and
</p>
<p>painful. A glance of triumphant encouragement to
</p>
<p>Delia, and her answering tearful smile, showed that
</p>
<p>they perfectlv understood each other. Indeed, it was
</p>
<p>time they should, for it had been settled that B ,
</p>
<p>who was a resident and justice of the peace of the

</p>
<p>As soon as it was over, they adjourned to the par
</p>
<p>lor, where B , drawing Delia to him, seated her
</p>
<p>on his knee. &quot; I don t half like this business,&quot; said
</p>
<p>he. &quot; I have no mind to take an active part in giv
</p>
<p>ing up my own little girl to this young fellow. I
</p>
<p>am too old to think of loving and fighting all in a
</p>
<p>breath, as he does, and I thought to wait till the wars
</p>
<p>were over, and here he comes and cuts me out. But
</p>
<p>I am determined to do nothing in prejudice of my
</p>
<p>claim, until I find that I have no chance. Young
</p>
<p>man,&quot; added he, in a tone gradually changing from
</p>
<p>playful to serious, &quot; do you love this dear girl with
</p>
<p>that faithful, single-hearted love, which man owes to
</p>
<p>a woman who gives him all her heart, and entrusts
</p>
<p>to him all her happiness, and all her hopes? &quot;
</p>
<p>As he said this he took the hand of Douglas, and
</p>
<p>went on: &quot;Do you thus love her, and will you in
</p>
<p>good faith manifest this love, by being to her a true
</p>
<p>and devoted husband, in every change and vicissitude
</p>
<p>of life, so long as life shall last ? Answer me, Doug
</p>
<p>las,&quot; he continued, with a voice approaching to
</p>
<p>sternness, and a fixed and searching look, while he
</p>
<p>strongly grasped the young man s hand.
</p>
<p>&quot; Assuredly I will,&quot; said Douglas, somewhat hurt.
</p>
<p>&quot; And you, dear,&quot; said B , resuming his kind
</p>
<p>and playful tone, &quot; do you love this young fellow in
</p>
<p>like sort, and will you, on your part, be to him thus
</p>
<p>faithful as his wife ? &quot;
</p>
<p>While B said- this the blushing Delia tried to
</p>
<p>disengage herself. But he detained her, and caught

</p>
<p>the hand with which she endeavored to loosen hig
</p>
<p>from her waist, and held it fast. At length she hid
</p>
<p>her face on his neck, whispering :
</p>
<p>&quot; You know I do. You know I will.
</p>
<p>&quot; Then God bless you, my children,&quot; said B ,
</p>
<p>bringing their hands together and grasping both
</p>
<p>firmly in one of his ; &quot; for you are married as fast as
</p>
<p>the law can tie you.&quot;
</p>
<p>In a moment the whole party were on their feet,
</p>
<p>each expressing a different variety of surprise. Doug
</p>
<p>las was the first to understand his situation fully, as
</p>
<p>appeared by his springing forward and catching his
</p>
<p>bride to his bosom, imprinting on her pure cheek the
</p>
<p>kiss that holy nature prompts, and that all the ca
</p>
<p>prices of fashion (thank God !) can never shame.
</p>
<p>From him she escaped into the arms of her mother,
</p>
<p>who, caressing her with murmured tenderness, looked
</p>
<p>half reproachfully at B . Then smiling through
</p>
<p>the tear that filled her large blue eye, she shook her
</p>
<p>finger at him, and said, &quot; Just like you ! Just like
</p>
<p>you!&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Fairly cheated you of your scene, Margaret.
</p>
<p>All the matronly airs, and maidenly airs, that you
</p>
<p>and Delia have been rehearsing this morning, gone
</p>
<p>for nothing. And there is dear little Lucia crying
</p>
<p>as if to break her heart, because sister Delia was

<p>married before she could fix her pretty little face
</p>
<p>for the occasion. Never mind, dear ! When your

<p>CHAPTEK XXX.
</p>
<p>Gathering tears and tremblings of distress ;
</p>
<p>And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago,
</p>
<p>Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness :
</p>
<p>And there were sudden partings, such as press
</p>
<p>The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs,
</p>
<p>Which ne er might be repeated : Who could guess
</p>
<p>If ever more should meet those mutual eyes ?
</p>
<p>BYRON.
</p>
<p>AND so it was. I can add nothing to the language
</p>
<p>of the poet. I can supply nothing to the imagina
</p>
<p>tion of the reader. Thus Douglas and Delia parted.
</p>
<p>Be accompanied his new acquaintance to the south
</p>
<p>ern capital ; he there met with men whose names
</p>
<p>live and will live in the history of their country, and
</p>
<p>whose memories will be honored while virtue is held
</p>
<p>in reverence among men. From these, and especially
</p>
<p>from the accomplished gentleman to whose friend
</p>
<p>ship he had been introduced by his uncle and Mr.
</p>
<p>B , he received such lights as dispelled every
</p>
<p>shadow of doubt from his mind. The wrongs of
</p>
<p>Virginia, her rights and her remedies, became the
</p>
<p>subject of all his thoughts, and he burned with
</p>
<p>impatience for the time when he might draw his

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 267
</p>
<p>expressed it, the lessons learned in the school of her
</p>
<p>oppressors.
</p>
<p>That time at length arrived. Returning by the
</p>
<p>upper road which skirts the foot of the mountains,
</p>
<p>he re-entered Virginia nearly at the spot to which
</p>
<p>his brother had gone in quest of him. There, as he
</p>
<p>had been taught to expect, he found Schwartz,
</p>
<p>whose reception of him fully justified the assurances
</p>
<p>of B . To that gentleman he showed unbounded
</p>
<p>devotion, delighted to speak of favors received at
</p>
<p>his hands, and of &quot; moving accidents by flood and
</p>
<p>field,&quot; which they had encountered together. Next
</p>
<p>to B , in his estimation, stood Mrs. Trevor ; then-
</p>
<p>Delia, for whom when a child he had formed a pas
</p>
<p>sionate attachment; and last, Mr. Trevor himself,
</p>
<p>whom, after the rest, he respected and admired
</p>
<p>above all human beings. A hint from B that
</p>
<p>Douglas was the husband of Delia placed him at
</p>
<p>once in the same catalogue of worthies, and from
</p>
<p>the first moment he devoted himself not less to his
</p>
<p>personal service than to the advancement of the
</p>
<p>common cause. He had already organized a small
</p>
<p>corps, the command of which he unreservedly sur
</p>
<p>rendered, making it his constant study to recom
</p>
<p>mend the new commander to the confidence of the
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>No man could deserve it better, or was better
</p>
<p>qualified to win it. Frank, affable, generous, and
</p>
<p>kind, his deportment was marked by that self-

</p>
<p>respectful courtesy which has all the goerd effect of
</p>
<p>268 . The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>dignity, without ever passing by that name. &quot;With
</p>
<p>nothing repulsive, austere, or cold in his demeanor,
</p>
<p>he was a man whose orders no soldier would ques
</p>
<p>tion, whose displeasure no gentleman would choose
</p>
<p>to incur, whose feelings no friend, however careless,
</p>
<p>would wound. Liberally supplied with money by
</p>
<p>his southern friends, and instructed by Schwartz in
</p>
<p>the judicious use of it, he took effectual measures to
</p>
<p>prevent distress in the families of his followers. A
</p>
<p>small sum amply satisfied their simple wants, and
</p>
<p>his men had the satisfaction of knowing that their
</p>
<p>families suffered nothing by their absence from their
</p>
<p>little farms.
</p>
<p>Beside the small embodied corps I have men
</p>
<p>tioned, the whole population of that warlike district
</p>
<p>were placed under a sort of organization, so that,
</p>
<p>while they pursued their occupations of hunting or
</p>
<p>farming, they were prepared, at any moment, to join
</p>
<p>an expedition or to resist an attack.
</p>
<p>Schwartz, who knew the country, inch by inch,
</p>
<p>made Douglas acquainted with all its strengths and
</p>
<p>all its passes, so that he soon became an expert
</p>
<p>woodsman, and an active mountaineer. His first
</p>
<p>care was to select a place for a stationary camp.
</p>
<p>For this purpose he chose a position strong by
</p>
<p>nature, which he made nearly impregnable. He
</p>
<p>aext provided horses enough to mount a part of his
</p>
<p>corps. For these the rich herbage of the mountains
</p>
<p>afforded abundant subsistence during the summer

<p>months. Of ammunition there was no stint. The
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 269
</p>
<p>lead mines were just at his back, beyond the Alleg-
</p>
<p>hanny. Powder is made of good quality in all that
</p>
<p>region, and the quantity necessary for the rifle is so
</p>
<p>small, that the rifleman may be said to carry a hun
</p>
<p>dred lives in his powder-horn. Of provisions he had
</p>
<p>plenty, though wanting many things deemed neces
</p>
<p>sary in a regular army. But the pure air of the
</p>
<p>mountains, and the exercise of hunting and scouting,
</p>
<p>preserved the health of the men, without tents, or
</p>
<p>salt, or vinegar, or vegetables of any kind. Venison
</p>
<p>and beef, dried in the sun, or over the fire by the
</p>
<p>process called jerking, was prepared in the season
</p>
<p>of abundance for winter use, and proved the best
</p>
<p>sort of food for a marauding corps. Light, compact,
</p>
<p>and nutritious, there is no diet on which a man can
</p>
<p>travel so far or fight so hard.
</p>
<p>Nothing now remained but to make his enemy
</p>
<p>feel him. Stooping from his mountain fastness, he
</p>
<p>soon broke up all the military posts in the adjacent
</p>
<p>counties ; so that, in a few weeks, not a blue-coat
</p>
<p>was to be seen on the south side of Staunton river,
</p>
<p>Freed from the presence of their enemy, the people
</p>
<p>were found ready to rise en masse. He dissuaded
</p>
<p>them from doing more than to put themselves in
</p>
<p>readiness for action, to furnish him needed supplies,
</p>
<p>for which he paid fairly, and to give him notice of
</p>
<p>the approach of the enemy. For this purpose he
</p>
<p>established a sort of half military organization, and
</p>
<p>had it in his power to increase his little force to five

</p>
<p>thus adapted to any occasion which could he
</p>
<p>expected to offer, after sweeping away the enemy
</p>
<p>from the south side of the river, he proceeded to
</p>
<p>hreak up the posts in the counties on the northern
</p>
<p>bank. In the end, though the enemy were nomi
</p>
<p>nally in possession of all the country between James
</p>
<p>river and Roanoke, they held no post higher than
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, nor any farther south than Farmville.
</p>
<p>Above this last place, their scouts and foraging par
</p>
<p>ties showed themselves occasionally, but never ven
</p>
<p>tured to leave the banks of James river for more
</p>
<p>than a single night.
</p>
<p>At Lynchburg, not long before the time at which
</p>
<p>our story commences, two companies had been
</p>
<p>posted. As Douglas had never shown a force of
</p>
<p>more than a hundred men, no fear of an attack on
</p>
<p>that point was entertained. But suddenly collecting
</p>
<p>a number of auxiliaries, he struck at them, drove
</p>
<p>them from their post, enriched his men with every
</p>
<p>thing that the laws of war permitted him to seize,
</p>
<p>and retreated to his stronghold in the mountains.
</p>
<p>The supplies of arms, ammunition, clothing, and
</p>
<p>blankets, thus procured, put him in condition to
</p>
<p>increase his corps, if necessary. Thus, at the time
</p>
<p>of which we speak, having little more than a hun
</p>
<p>dred men embodied, he could have marched five
</p>
<p>times that number to Richmond; and, for any service
</p>
<p>near at hand, could have commanded a yet larger
</p>
<p>force. Though unprovided with many of the con

</p>
<p>veniences of military life, they were not deficient in
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 271
</p>
<p>essentials. There was &quot; not a bit of feather in his
</p>
<p>host,&quot; nor drum, nor trumpet, nor banner. But
</p>
<p>there were stout hearts, and strong hands, and fleet
</p>
<p>limbs, and good rifles, and knives and tomahawks ;
</p>
<p>and that system and harmony which spring from a
</p>
<p>sense of danger, a high purpose, and confidence in
</p>
<p>a leader. To the listening ear, a whisper speaks
</p>
<p>louder than a trumpet to the heedless. To the
</p>
<p>trusting heart, the chieftain s voice supersedes the
</p>
<p>spirit-stirring drum.
</p>
<p>While Douglas thus maintained his position among
</p>
<p>the mountains, it became a sort of Cave of Adullam.
</p>
<p>His little corps was a nucleus to which the discon
</p>
<p>tented and persecuted gathered continually. His
</p>
<p>embodied force was increased, while the organiza
</p>
<p>tion of the neighboring population became more
</p>
<p>perfect, their confidence firmer, their zeal more ardent.
</p>
<p>So effectually had he broken the power of the Central
</p>
<p>Government in that quarter, that it had been deemed
</p>
<p>expedient to throw a much larger federal force into
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, to curb his progress in that direction, and
</p>
<p>to restrain the disaffected in the counties along the
</p>
<p>north bank of James river. Could he have co
</p>
<p>operated with the friends of Virginia there, it was not
</p>
<p>clear that the flame might not spread on and on, in
</p>
<p>the direction of Washington, until the very seat of
</p>
<p>empire might be unsafe. Hence a regiment had been
</p>
<p>detached from the army at Richmond, and another
</p>
<p>from the North, originally destined for that place, was
</p>
<p>turned aside to Lynchburg. Aware of these move-

</p>
<p>ments, Douglas had no doubt that the purpose of such
</p>
<p>an assemblage of force was not merely preventive.
</p>
<p>He saw that attempts would be made to recover the
</p>
<p>ground which the enemy had lost on the south side of
</p>
<p>James river ; and that, by remaining strictly on the
</p>
<p>defensive, he might be forced to withdraw his em
</p>
<p>bodied force to their mountain stronghold, and not
</p>
<p>only lose the aid of his irregulars, but give them up
</p>
<p>to the vengeance of the enemy. Under these circum
</p>
<p>stances, attack was the most effectual form of defence,
</p>
<p>and boldness was true prudence.
</p>
<p>The time, too, was at hand for the decisive move
</p>
<p>ment, in the lower counties, for the relief of Rich
</p>
<p>mond. The desired diversion had been effected, and
</p>
<p>Douglas found himself capable of bringing into the
</p>
<p>field a force, the presence of which would be no incon
</p>
<p>siderable aid to that about to assemble below. To
</p>
<p>strike at his enemy therefore, to overwhelm him if
</p>
<p>possible, and, if not, to elude him and fall down to
</p>
<p>the assistance of B , seemed to be the surest plan for
</p>
<p>preserving the safety and independence even of the
</p>
<p>mountain region. If successful, every desirable end
</p>
<p>would be accomplished. Even should he fail, his
</p>
<p>duty to the faithful yeomanry and peasantry of that
</p>
<p>devoted section, was rather to draw the enemy away
</p>
<p>after him toward Richmond, than by falling directly
</p>
<p>back, or even by remaining where he was, to invite
</p>
<p>them to overrun the country which had afforded him
</p>
<p>such zealous and efficient co-operation.

</p>
<p>Influenced by these considerations, Douglas had
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 273
</p>
<p>despatched Schwartz to lay them before B , and
</p>
<p>receive his instructions. He had long ago recognised
</p>
<p>him as the person of whom his aunt had said that
</p>
<p>&quot; the destiny of Virginia depended on him.&quot; He had
</p>
<p>received at his hands the sort of authority which he
</p>
<p>wielded, now indeed by his own personal influence
</p>
<p>and character, but originally as the trusted represen
</p>
<p>tative of B . He had no mind to shake off that
</p>
<p>character. He had seen that, by means not exactly
</p>
<p>understood, that gentleman commanded resources,
</p>
<p>both at home and abroad, which enabled him to
</p>
<p>meditate plans, in which all the operations of
</p>
<p>Douglas s corps, however brilliant, were but circum
</p>
<p>stances of less importance themselves than in their
</p>
<p>relations.
</p>
<p>Schwartz was the sole medium of communication
</p>
<p>between the two. &quot;With nothing in his appearance to
</p>
<p>attract attention nothing in his manners or common
</p>
<p>style of conversation betokening powders superior to
</p>
<p>those of any other peasant his intelligence and
</p>
<p>fidelity supplied the place of letters. He understood

<p>every thing, and forgot nothing that was said to him.

<p>He therefore carried no papers, and passed unsus

<p>harmless gossip, all he chanced to fall in with. lie

<p>ANONYMOUS.
</p>
<p>LET us now return to the deep glen, at the bottom
</p>
<p>of which we left our friend Arthur, accompanied by
</p>
<p>his mountain guide. Schwartz was welcomed with
</p>
<p>cordial joy by his comrades, and, having asked for
</p>
<p>the Captain, was told he was in his tent. Arthur
</p>
<p>looked around in vain for a tent, but saw none.
</p>
<p>The beetling crags .on both sides of the dell seemed
</p>
<p>to be the only shelter that the place afforded. But
</p>
<p>against the rock, a hundred yards below, and
</p>
<p>directly beneath the spot from which Schwartz had
</p>
<p>given notice of his presence, hung a piece of tent-
</p>
<p>cloth. One edge of this was tacked to a pole which
</p>
<p>lay horizontally against the rocky wall, the ends
</p>
<p>being supported by forks about ten feet long. This
</p>
<p>proved to be a sort of door to a wide-mouthed
</p>
<p>cavernous recess in the rock, deep enough to afford
</p>
<p>room for the few little conveniences which an officer

</p>
<p>can expect to keep about him in active service.
</p>
<p>276 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>Approaching this, Schwartz lifted the corner, and
</p>
<p>our travellers stood in the presence of Douglas.
</p>
<p>He was seated at a coarse table, poring over a
</p>
<p>rude manuscript map, and did not lift his head until
</p>
<p>he heard the word &quot; brother&quot; uttered by the well-
</p>
<p>known voice of Arthur. In a moment they were in
</p>
<p>each other s arms, and, in the next, the new-coiner
</p>
<p>was overwhelmed with questions about his father,
</p>
<p>mother, and various friends. Some indeed were not
</p>
<p>named ; for, though Schwartz was in the secret of
</p>
<p>the fact, he was incapable of being let into the
</p>
<p>deeper mystery of hearts like those of Douglas and
</p>
<p>Delia. To such the utterance of a beloved name in
</p>
<p>the presence of the uninitiated is an unpardonable
</p>
<p>profanation. But though that of Delia was not
</p>
<p>spoken, Arthur took care so to emphasize his account
</p>
<p>of the health of his uncle s family, as to convey to
</p>
<p>the mind of Douglas an assurance of all he wished
</p>
<p>to hear. But if Schwartz was not deep in the ten
</p>
<p>der mysteries of refined and delicate love, no man
</p>
<p>better understood a hint, or better knew how to
</p>
<p>improve it. He accordingly interrupted the con
</p>
<p>versation, just to say that he brought important
</p>
<p>intelligence, which must be communicated that
</p>
<p>night ; adding that he would leave them together for
</p>
<p>an hour. He now withdrew, and afforded the
</p>
<p>desired opportunity for unreserved conversation.
</p>
<p>&quot;My Delia,&quot; said Douglas; &quot;I understand that
</p>
<p>she is well, and, I hope, happy.&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot;She is happy,&quot; said Arthur. &quot;She hears of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 277
</p>
<p>you, from the impartial voice of public fame, in
</p>
<p>terms that fill her heart with pride, and leave no
</p>
<p>room there for alarm or melancholy. She feels as
</p>
<p>becomes a soldier s wife, anxious for her husband s
</p>
<p>fate, but confident in his fortunes. She has caught
</p>
<p>this notion from Mr. B , who is her oracle, and
</p>
<p>who seems to have imparted to her, not only all his
</p>
<p>sentiments, but all the energy and buoyancy of his
</p>
<p>self-confident mind.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God!&quot; said Douglas. &quot;Just so would
</p>
<p>I have her to be. I knew it would be so. I saw
</p>
<p>her noble mother, when danger threatened my
</p>
<p>uncle ; and I saw her too. But this is the first posi
</p>
<p>tive information, on that point, that has reached me
</p>
<p>since I have been here. Mr. B - and I can only
</p>
<p>correspond by messages through Schwartz, and
</p>
<p>though he is plain and accurate as a printed book in
</p>
<p>repeating what he understands, yet ideas of this sort
</p>
<p>are not in his line. And my good and venerable
</p>
<p>old father are you here with his permission ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not ; nor does he know where I am. I
</p>
<p>have no doubt that I should have his approbation if
</p>
<p>he did. I am sure you have.
</p>
<p>&quot; I !&quot; exclaimed Douglas, with a start of violent
</p>
<p>surprise. &quot;What does he know of me?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing at all,&quot; said Arthur, smiling. &quot;But he
</p>
<p>knows of a certain partisan leader, whom the world
</p>
<p>calls Captain Douglas, and if I can read the old
</p>
<p>man s eyes, when he hears that name, he would

<p>rather call that man his son than any other on earth.&quot;
</p>
<p>278 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>As Arthur spoke the eyes of Douglas filled, and,
</p>
<p>pressing his hand to his brow, he bowed his head a
</p>
<p>moment on the table. Then rising, he stood erect,
</p>
<p>and looking up with a rapt and abstracted air, his
</p>
<p>eye flashing through his tears, he folded his arms,
</p>
<p>and speaking in the measured tone of one who feels
</p>
<p>deeply, but in whose mind thought masters feeling,
</p>
<p>he parodied that noble speech which Shakspeare
</p>
<p>puts in the mouth of Prince Henry:
</p>
<p>&quot; Then in the closing of some glorious day,
</p>
<p>&quot;When I shall wear a garment all of blood,
</p>
<p>And stain my favors with a bloody mask,
</p>
<p>I will be bold to tell him, I am your son. &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And my Delia ! my virgin bride ! O ! for that
</p>
<p>day,
</p>
<p>&quot; When woman s pure kiss, sweet and long,
</p>
<p>Welcomes her warrior home.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I tell you, Arthur, that, in thoughts like these,
</p>
<p>there is a rapture which makes this hole in the rock
</p>
<p>a palace, and this flinty couch a bed of down. Are
</p>
<p>you prepared, my dear fellow, to partake with me in
</p>
<p>such feelings? That, I know, depends in part on
</p>
<p>Lucia. What of her?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; She is to me,&quot; said Arthur, &quot; all that Delia is
</p>
<p>to yon ; though she is too young to have the same

<p>strength of mind, and I have no right to expect the

<p>Bame confidence in my prowess and fortunes.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 279
</p>
<p>&quot; Never fear. It will not Dfc wanting at the pinch.
</p>
<p>A woman never fears for the safety of him she
</p>
<p>loves but when she doubts his truth. Let her feel
</p>
<p>that she is his second self, and self-confidence calnib
</p>
<p>her fears. Let her feel that she lives in his heart,
</p>
<p>and, strong in love, she defies the dagger which as
</p>
<p>sails it. Calpurnia trembled for Csesar. Why?
</p>
<p>He was the husband of every woman in Rome.
</p>
<p>Had he been true to her, she would have felt only
</p>
<p>that prudent fear that he would not have derided.
</p>
<p>He would, perhaps, have yielded to her discreet
</p>
<p>remonstrance, and her love would have justified the
</p>
<p>confidence which characterizes the love of woman,
</p>
<p>by saving his life. But, what a rhapsody I am
</p>
<p>uttering ! You say my father does not know where
</p>
<p>you are ? How is that ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I was not at liberty to acquaint him with your
</p>
<p>secret. Your absence has drawn on him some dis
</p>
<p>pleasure from those in power, and their minions are
</p>
<p>all around him. It seems that you are supposed to
</p>
<p>be in the South for no good purpose, and not with
</p>
<p>out an understanding with him. My disappearance
</p>
<p>will attract farther notice. Jtor that he cares little ;
</p>
<p>but he is so scrupulous in his notions of honor and
</p>
<p>truth, that, were he questioned about us, he could
</p>
<p>hardly conceal any thing he might know. Your
</p>
<p>letters, I see, still come from the South, though they
</p>
<p>say nothing of your whereabout. Of course, he

<p>thinks you are there ; and I, without undeceiving

<p>280 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>his feelings are with us, I have no doubt. But he is
</p>
<p>so beset by spies, and so hampered by the position
</p>
<p>of our brothers in the army and navy, that he even
</p>
<p>tries to hide the secret of his thoughts from him
</p>
<p>self.&quot;
</p>
<p>Thus the brothers conversed until Schwartz re
</p>
<p>turned and claimed the Captain s ear ; who began by
</p>
<p>asking what news he brought from B .
</p>
<p>&quot; The Colonel (so he always designated B ) likes
</p>
<p>your plan mightily, sir,&quot; replied Schwartz, &quot; if you
</p>
<p>can rub through with it. But he is afraid, from all
</p>
<p>he can learn, that them fellows at Lynchburg may
</p>
<p>be too many for you ; so, he says, you must find out
</p>
<p>exactly how that is, and if you don t think it a pretty
</p>
<p>good chance, just slip down along the line, toward
</p>
<p>the middle of November, and join him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;If I do so, where am I to find him precisely?&quot;
</p>
<p>asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Just where the Petersburg railroad crosses the
</p>
<p>line,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot; You see the folks there are
</p>
<p>all friendly, because as long as things stay as they
</p>
<p>are, their railroad an t worth an old flint, and so they
</p>
<p>are patching up all the old cars, and fixing every
</p>
<p>thing for the Colonel, as soon as he can start a
</p>
<p>regiment or so, to make a dash at Petersburg, and
</p>
<p>so hold on there till the rest of his men join him.
</p>
<p>N&quot;ow, if we were to be the first there, Captain, I
</p>
<p>liave a notion that we d be the very boys for them
</p>
<p>chaps at Petersburg.&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; I should like that well,&quot; said Douglas. &quot; But
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 281
</p>
<p>I understand my old acquaintance, Col. Mason, at
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, lias a great desire to see me, and I should
</p>
<p>hate to disappoint him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t think he commands there now,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Schwartz. &quot; There is another regiment come from
</p>
<p>the North to join him, and they say the other is the
</p>
<p>oldest colonel.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is of course,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; for Mason is
</p>
<p>the youngest in the army. But I am not sorry for
</p>
<p>the exchange, for they have hardly sent as good a
</p>
<p>one. There is not a man among them I would not
</p>
<p>rather meet than Mason. Have you been able to
</p>
<p>learn the particulars of their force there ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; As well as I can understand,&quot; replied Schwartz,
</p>
<p>&quot; the whole number is not far from a thousand, and
</p>
<p>may be a few more.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; A thousand ! Can we raise men enough to strike
</p>
<p>at them before they think of it ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have not a doubt of it, sir, if we could get at
</p>
<p>them on fair terms. The people along down be
</p>
<p>tween here and Staunton river don t like the thoughts
</p>
<p>of what them fellows may do to them, and they are
</p>
<p>keen to take them before they are ready. I talked
</p>
<p>to the head-men among them, as you told me, and
</p>
<p>they all see that the right way is to try to get the
</p>
<p>first blow. Because, you see, Captain, when we aiTt
</p>
<p>gaining we are losing. If we let the enemy hold
</p>
<p>Lynchburg, and they find two regiments will not do,
</p>
<p>they will bring four, and so on, till they get the upper

<p>282 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>about here for old and new. But if we could make
</p>
<p>out to give them a real beating, and so drive them
</p>
<p>clean off, why all the country as far as the Rappa-
</p>
<p>hannock would rise that minute, and they d have
</p>
<p>enough to do to hold their own at Fredericksburg.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I suppose you said all this to Mr. B ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; To be sure I did, sir; and he thinks just as we
</p>
<p>do about it, only he is dubious about attacking a
</p>
<p>fortified camp, as they call it, just with rifles.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He is right about that,&quot; replied Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Riflemen are the best troops in the world to defend
</p>
<p>a breastwork, but they are the worst to attack one.
</p>
<p>I had hopes, however, that we might have drawn
</p>
<p>out the enemy by some device, even when Mason
</p>
<p>commanded. He is too brave to be ashamed to be
</p>
<p>prudent. I wish I knew whom they have sent to
</p>
<p>supersede him. But, whoever he is, it is a hundred
</p>
<p>to one, that being set over the head of an abler man,
</p>
<p>he will be impatient to show his superiority by
</p>
<p>reversing his predecessor s plans, and shaming the
</p>
<p>prudence of Mason by some hasty display of valor.
</p>
<p>If I did but know who was in command !&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I tried to find that out,&quot; replied Schwartz ; &quot; be
</p>
<p>cause 1 knew you were pretty well acquainted with
</p>
<p>the most of them. You remember, sir, you told me
</p>
<p>from the first almost exactly how this Col. Mason
</p>
<p>was going to do. But* I could not find any body
</p>
<p>that could tell me the new Colonel s name. But,

<p>&quot; I am afraid that is all too true,&quot; said Douglas,

</p>
<p>&quot; Yon must understand, Captain,&quot; continued
</p>
<p>Schwartz, &quot; that I had allotted to fall in with your
</p>
<p>brother about Little Roanoke bridge, where our roads
</p>
<p>come together. The people there are friendly, and
</p>
<p>mighty clever people, and if they don t know all
</p>
<p>about me, they don t want much of it ; for they are
</p>
<p>our own sort of folks, and true as steel. So I thought
</p>
<p>I could depend on them to take notice for me when
</p>
<p>such a man might pass, and let me know. When
</p>
<p>I got there, by all I could learn, your brother had*
</p>
<p>not gone by ; and, as I was pretty tired, and that is
</p>
<p>one of the places where I commonly lie by to pick
</p>
<p>up news, I thought I would stop a while.
</p>
<p>&quot; I had not been there long, before here comes
</p>
<p>the Captain that commands the company at Farm-
</p>
<p>ville ; and if ever I saw a conceited fool, you may
</p>
<p>be sure he is one. What he was after, the Lord

<p>knows. He said he was reconnoitring, but I have

<p>a notion he was just looking for somebody to talk

<p>to ; and as the folks there ain t got much chat for

<p>The Partisan Leader. 285
</p>
<p>any body, he just claps to talking to me. And he
</p>
<p>run on about one thing and another, and there was
</p>
<p>nothing I wanted to know but what he told me, only
</p>
<p>just I knew it all before. But I thought, may be, I
</p>
<p>might get something out of him, so I let him talk,
</p>
<p>and I sot and listened. *
</p>
<p>&quot; After a while he gets to talking about you.
</p>
<p>And, Lord ! how he wished you would come in his
</p>
<p>way ; and how he would have served you, if you
</p>
<p>had tried to beat up his quarters, like you did them
</p>
<p>fellows at Lynchburg. But he was in hopes to
</p>
<p>have a clip at you yet, only just you were always
</p>
<p>hiding and skulking in the mountains, like a wolf,
</p>
<p>and then coming down in the night to kill sheep.
</p>
<p>And he reckoned you knew where the dogs was, and
</p>
<p>took care to keep out of their way. And then he
</p>
<p>laughed, and thought he was mighty smart. So,

<p>thought I, &amp;lt; stranger, if you have a mind to get into

<p>hot water, may be you may have a chance. So I

<p>and he has got tricks enough, and signs and coun

</p>
<p>then it an t a secret no more.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It s a wonder,&quot; says he, &quot; some of them don t
</p>
<p>tell.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; May be they cannot get any thing by telling,&quot;
</p>
<p>says I. &quot; There s many a poor fellow there, to my
</p>
<p>knowing, that don t see a dollar once a year, and its
</p>
<p>mighty little the sight of a few yellow jackets would
</p>
<p>not make them tell, only just they never seed any,
</p>
<p>and don t know what they are. But they ll be right
</p>
<p>apt to find out.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You talk like you know that part of the coun

<p>try,&quot; says he. &quot; May be you know something about
</p>
<p>it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; May be I might,&quot; says I. &quot; But then,&quot; says I,
</p>
<p>&quot; it don t become a poor fellow, like me, to know
</p>
<p>any thing that a grand officer, with his fine apper-
</p>
<p>lets, all of solid gold, don t know. Lord !&quot; says I,
</p>
<p>&quot; if I had but half the money you give for your
</p>
<p>apperlets, I reckon I d know something then.&quot;
</p>
<p>And with that he looks right hard at me, and
</p>
<p>nays he, &quot; May be you d like to list for a soldier.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; May be I would,&quot; says I, &quot; if th ey pays me well.

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 287
</p>
<p>nothing about; only I takes their part as takes my
</p>
<p>part. And that s the reason,&quot; says I, &quot; I would not
</p>
<p>stay up yonder.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; says he, &quot;do you live there, when you
</p>
<p>are at home ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say,&quot; says I, &quot;that I have got a home
</p>
<p>rightly anywhere. But I did live there, after a fashion ;
</p>
<p>and they wanted me to do like the rest of them, and
</p>
<p>quit my business and keep guard, and stop every man
</p>
<p>that could not give the signs. And what was I to
</p>
<p>get by it ? Just nothing at all. If I had any bread
</p>
<p>of my own to eat, why, I might eat it ; and if I killed
</p>
<p>a deer, they d take their share, and thought they did
</p>
<p>great things if they let me keep the skin ; but as to
</p>
<p>pay, they don t think of such a thing. But that would
</p>
<p>not do for me,&quot; says I ; &quot; and, more than that, it won t
</p>
<p>do for more, besides me, whatever Captain Douglas
</p>
<p>may think of it, I can tell him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; says he, &quot;if you ll list with me you shall
</p>
<p>have pay, and bounty, and clothes, and rations, and
</p>
<p>all. Cause,&quot; says he, &quot; the President, he keeps the
</p>
<p>key of the treasury, and we are his soldiers, and we
</p>
<p>all live like fighting cocks, I can tell you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; says I, &quot; I d like to list well enough, only
</p>
<p>just I guess if once you had me for a soldier, you d
</p>
<p>make me tell all I know, and ax me no odds ; and,&quot;
</p>
<p>says I, &quot; I have been a- thinking, if I could meet with
</p>
<p>any right clever gentleman, that would pay me
</p>
<p>for telling, I d tell it all first, and then list after
</p>
<p>wards.&quot;

<p>288 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; says he, &quot; do you know Douglas s signs,
</p>
<p>enough to carry a man to his camp as a friend?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I guess I do,&quot; says I, &quot; and more than that,
</p>
<p>too.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And what do you know ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot; That s telling,&quot; says I.
</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; says he, &quot;I want to know all about it,&quot;
</p>
<p>says he, &quot; because Col. Mason, there, at Lynchburg, is
</p>
<p>determined to break Douglas up, if he can get at him ;
</p>
<p>and he is looking every day for more men from the
</p>
<p>North to help him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; says I, &quot; I can put him in a way to get at
</p>
<p>him, and not go up there into the mountains neither.
</p>
<p>Cause,&quot; says I, &quot;that s an ugly place. It an t one
</p>
<p>regiment, nor two neither hardly, that could do much
</p>
<p>there. And then, again, if Douglas was to find too
</p>
<p>many coming against him, he d be away t other side
</p>
<p>of Salem before they d get there.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And how is a body to get at him ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot;Ah !&quot; says I, &quot; that s a long story.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; says he, &quot;I see what you are after, and if
</p>
<p>you ll put me in a way to give Col. Mason a fair clip
</p>
<p>at him, it will make my fortune, and then I ll be bound
</p>
<p>to see you paid handsomely.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That an t what I am after,&quot; says I.
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, don t you want money ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot; To be sure I do,&quot; says I ; &quot; but that an t money.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot; tell me what you can do, and I
</p>
<p>will tell you what I ll do.&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; That s something like,&quot; says I. &quot; As to what I
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 289
</p>
<p>can do, I can put you in a way to catch Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas out of the mountains, with as many men as
</p>
<p>you please to bring agin him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;if you ll do that, I ll pay you a
</p>
<p>hundred dollars.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; The dear Lord !&quot; says I. &quot; A hundred dollars !
</p>
<p>I never expected to have that much money in my
</p>
<p>life!&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; May be it s too much,&quot; says he. &quot; May be fifty
</p>
<p>will do?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; No, no,&quot; says I ; &quot; a hundred will do mighty
</p>
<p>well ; so let me have the cash, and I ll tell you all.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;That won t do,&quot; says he. &quot;How do I know
</p>
<p>that what you are going to tell me will do me any
</p>
<p>good?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; says I, &quot; I reckon if one won t another
</p>
<p>will.&quot;
</p>
<p>So, with that, he studied a while, and says he :
</p>
<p>&quot; Well, I ll give you my note for a hundred dollars,
</p>
<p>to be paid directly after Col. Mason gets a lick at
</p>
<p>Douglas in the low country, by my help.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Cannot you give me an order on Mr. Morton, here,
</p>
<p>in the same way ?&quot; says I.
</p>
<p>&quot; You are mighty tight,&quot; says he; &quot; but may be I
</p>
<p>can.&quot;
</p>
<p>So, with that he speaks to Mr. Morton, and he
</p>
<p>agreed to accept the order. You see, sir, Mr.
</p>
<p>Morton, as I told you, is a true-hearted Virginian ;
</p>
<p>and he knows me, and I just sorter winked at him,

<p>to let him know all was safe. For as to that fellow

<p>290 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>paying him again after he paid me, Mr. Morton
</p>
<p>hadn t no thought of it, nor I neither. But he seed
</p>
<p>what I was after, and says he to the Captain : &quot; To
</p>
<p>be sure, sir, it s nothing I would not do to serve the
</p>
<p>country.&quot; And with that they fixed the order .all
</p>
<p>right, and gives it to me, and I slips it back again
</p>
<p>into Mr. Morton s hand. And then I takes the
</p>
<p>Captain out again, and tells him the way up here ;
</p>
<p>and, says I, &quot; Now, if you can get to see Captain
</p>
<p>Douglas, you must fix a good story to tell him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And what must that be ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, you have only just to tell him that you
</p>
<p>have raised a parcel of men in Bedford county, or
</p>
<p>somewhere thereaway, sorter toward Lynchburg, and
</p>
<p>you want to know where to join him. Then he ll be
</p>
<p>sure to tell you when he is coming down out of the
</p>
<p>mountains, and he ll name a place for you to meet
</p>
<p>him at, and then if you don t fix him about right, it
</p>
<p>an t my fault.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;But how am I to get to him ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot; That s it,&quot; says I, &quot; and that s what you never
</p>
<p>could do without help. You see,&quot; says I, &quot; sir, every
</p>
<p>man in that country lives by hunting, more or less ;
</p>
<p>and every man has a rifle for himself, and one for
</p>
<p>every one of his boys, and may be more. And when
</p>
<p>a fellow is going anywhere, he never knows when
</p>
<p>he may see a deer ; so you never can catch them
</p>
<p>without their rifles. But then you may travel all
</p>
<p>through the country, and you won t see a man that

</p>
<p>looks any ways like a soldier. And when they want
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 291
</p>
<p>to stop a man, they don t bawl at him and ask for
</p>
<p>the countersign. That sort of thing may do in an
</p>
<p>army, but it won t do with folks that have not got an
</p>
<p>army to back them. So you may fall in with ever so
</p>
<p>many of them, and they ll find you out ; but if they
</p>
<p>choose to let you pass, you ll never find them out, nor
</p>
<p>know what they are after.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But how are they to find me out,&quot; says he, &quot;if
</p>
<p>they an t got no countersign ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; They an t got no countersign, rightly&quot; says I ;
</p>
<p>&quot; but it is pretty much the same thing, if a man asks
</p>
<p>you a civil question, and you don t know what answer
</p>
<p>to give him. Now, suppose you was travelling along
</p>
<p>there, and you meets one of them fellows, and he was
</p>
<p>to ask you, mighty innocent like, what parts you were
</p>
<p>from. What would you say ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t know,&quot; says he. &quot; May be I d tell him I
</p>
<p>was from down about Halifax court-house.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And that minute,&quot; says I, &quot; he d know all about
</p>
<p>you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How s that ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, that s the way they ax for the countersign,&quot;
</p>
<p>says I.
</p>
<p>&quot; What is the countersign ?&quot; says he.
</p>
<p>&quot; CUKRITUCK,&quot; says I; &quot;when they ax you that,
</p>
<p>you must say you come from Currituck.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And is that all ?&quot; says he. &quot; Why, that is a
</p>
<p>countersign, sure enough. But don t they never
</p>
<p>change it ?&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; No,&quot; says I ; &quot; the men are too much scattered all
</p>
<p>292 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>through the country, for that ; but it answers mighty
</p>
<p>well, the way they fix it. They don t let you off
</p>
<p>with one question, just so, but they ll ask you a heap
</p>
<p>more ; and they ll say a heap of simple things to you
</p>
<p>just to hear what you ll say ; and just about the time
</p>
<p>you think you have fooled them, they ll find you out.
</p>
<p>There s a parcel of sharp fellows up thereaway, mind,
</p>
<p>I tell you ; and you ll have to get your lesson mighty
</p>
<p>well before you go there. You see, some will ask
</p>
<p>you one question and some another. You don t know
</p>
<p>what it s going to be ; so I must tell you all the straight
</p>
<p>of it, and you must practise before we part ; and then,&quot;
</p>
<p>says I, &quot; you can write it all down, and all the way
</p>
<p>you go you can be saying it over.&quot; So, with that, sir,
</p>
<p>I tells him the biggest part of our questions ; but you
</p>
<p>may be sure I gave him wrong answers to every one
</p>
<p>of them. But then I told our people at the different
</p>
<p>stations along about him, and toldtihem to pass him,
</p>
<p>and never let him know but what his answers were
</p>
<p>all right. So then I tells him that when he got to you,
</p>
<p>you would want to know, may be, how he came by
</p>
<p>the signs ; and, says I, &quot; when he axes you that, you
</p>
<p>must tell him you got them from Job Di-xon,&quot; says I.
</p>
<p>l That s a fellow the Captain keeps busy recruiting
</p>
<p>away down the country, and when he hears that, he
</p>
<p>won t suspicion you the least in the world ; cause you
</p>
<p>see,&quot; says I, &quot; the man they call Job Dixon has got
</p>
<p>another name besides that, and that name an t nothing
</p>
<p>but a sort of a countersign for the Captain to know

</p>
<p>the men by that he sends in.&quot; You see, Captain, I
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 293
</p>
<p>fixed all this way, that I might let you know exactly,
</p>
<p>so that if the fellow should come when I was out of
</p>
<p>the way, you might know what to think of him, just
</p>
<p>as if I was here. And it won t do to let him see me,
</p>
<p>no how.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Job Dixon /&quot; said Douglas. &quot; Well, let me
</p>
<p>make a memorandum of that name.&quot;
</p>
<p>Saying this, he took a letter from his pocket, and
</p>
<p>endorsing the name of Job Dixon on the back of
</p>
<p>it, as that of the writer, threw it on the table.
</p>
<p>&quot; That will do,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot; He will be here
</p>
<p>bright and early in the morning, and when lie sees
</p>
<p>that, he will feel as safe as a rat in a mill.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Here in the morning!&quot; said Douglas. &quot;How
</p>
<p>can you be sure of that ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I seed him from the top of the mountain,&quot;
</p>
<p>replied Schwartz, &quot; when Witt stopped him. I told
</p>
<p>Witt to keep him all night, and send him on in the
</p>
<p>morning, with a couple of fellows to show him the
</p>
<p>way, and guard him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; If that is the case,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; I can meet
</p>
<p>him at the piquet, and stop him there ; for I would
</p>
<p>rather he should not see this place. Bat what
</p>
<p>arrangement would you advise me to make with
</p>
<p>him ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Why, the Colonel says,&quot; replied Schwartz,
</p>
<p>&quot; that he wants you to join him at his rendezvous
</p>
<p>about the last of November, or may be a little ear
</p>
<p>lier; so whatever you do ought to be done time

<p>enough to fall back, if we get worsted, and slip
</p>
<p>294 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>along down the line, according to your old plan.
</p>
<p>So I am a thinking it would be well to fix the time
</p>
<p>for meeting this fellow about the tenth of the month,
</p>
<p>and then, if we can catch them in their own trap, we
</p>
<p>shall have time to follow up the blow and break up
</p>
<p>their whole establishment there at Lynchburg, and
</p>
<p>then march boldly down the straight road.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Do you know of any crossing-place on Staunton
</p>
<p>river, in the direction of Lynchburg,&quot; asked Doug
</p>
<p>las, &quot; that would answer for an ambuscade ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have a notion,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot; that Jones s
</p>
<p>Ford would suit as . well as any other ; because
</p>
<p>there s a deep hollow comes down on both sides of
</p>
<p>it, and thick woods on the hills.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;That will do then,&quot; said Douglas. &quot;So now
</p>
<p>let us take our supper and go to rest; for I must be
</p>
<p>at the piquet in time to meet your man. Before
</p>
<p>you go to sleep, suppose you send one of our boys
</p>
<p>to tell them to stop him if he gets there before me.&quot;
</p>
<p>The supper was produced, and fully justified what
</p>
<p>Witt had told Arthur of the fare he might expect.
</p>
<p>As to lodging, bear-skins were plenty, and so were
</p>
<p>blankets, which had been collected during the expe
</p>
<p>dition against Lynchburg. But a rock is a hard
</p>
<p>bed, put on it what you will. Yet youth, and
</p>
<p>health, and high excitement, gave Arthur a most

<p>luxurious supper, and a night of such sleep as the

<p>The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep.
</p>
<p>WHEN Arthur awoke, he found himself alone.
</p>
<p>The sun was high in the heavens, but a deep shadow
</p>
<p>hung over the dark glen, into which his rays never
</p>
<p>looked, except at noon-day. Arthur now walked
</p>
<p>out, and amused himself with gazing around on the
</p>
<p>singular spot which his brother had chosen as a
</p>
<p>place of refuge. It was, indeed, a place of strength,
</p>
<p>which seemed calculated to bid defiance to any
</p>
<p>thing but famine.
</p>
<p>The glen, at this point, might be some two hun
</p>
<p>dred feet deep. Above and below, the little stream
</p>
<p>filled the whole chasm, pouring furiously along
</p>
<p>between overhanging cliifs. The tops of these,
</p>
<p>except in the immediate vicinity, were crowned with
</p>
<p>lofty trees, which, nodding to each other across the
</p>
<p>gulph, in some places nearly intermingled their
</p>
<p>branches. The valley, jnst where Douglas had
</p>
<p>pitched his camp, was somewhat wider. Jnst above,
</p>
<p>the stream seemed to gush from the very bowels of
</p>
<p>the mountain, dashing, as it tumbled over a fall of
</p>
<p>twenty or thirty feet, against the dark evergreens
</p>
<p>which clustered bulli bides of the gulph. From

<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>(hence, flowing through a wider space, it still COL
</p>
<p>fined itself to a narrow and deep channel, scooped
</p>
<p>into an almost cavernous bed, under the western
</p>
<p>cliff. Thence, turning abruptly to the southeast, it
</p>
<p>swept across the dell to the opposite hill, from which
</p>
<p>it again recoiled in like manner. There was thus,
</p>
<p>on each side, between the hill and the receding
</p>
<p>stream, a spot of dry ground, or rather rock. It was
</p>
<p>indeed nothing but a rocky shelf, a little above inun
</p>
<p>dation, jutting in a half moon from the base of the
</p>
<p>cliff. About the middle of its passage from hill to
</p>
<p>hill, the stream tumbled over a ledge, the highest
</p>
<p>points of which, rising above the water, served as
</p>
<p>stepping stones, and afforded a passage across, prac
</p>
<p>ticable indeed, but neither commodious, nor to the
</p>
<p>eye of a stranger, even safe.
</p>
<p>The sort of stair which afforded the only approach
</p>
<p>to this savage den, hung directly over the stream, at
</p>
<p>the point where, having crossed from the western

<p>have said, a dry spot on its eastern margin. At the

<p>upper corner of this shelf, where it touched the cliff,
</p>
<p>the path reached the bottom ; and an hundred yards
</p>
<p>below, at the lower extremity of the same platform,
</p>
<p>hung the tent-cloth that indicated the quarters of the
</p>
<p>chief.
</p>
<p>The sort of cave, the mouth of which was con
</p>
<p>cealed by this, was but a deepening of the recess
</p>
<p>under the cliff, which everywhere afforded a partial

<p>shelter from the weather, and a complete defence
</p>

</p>
<p>against rocks tumbled from above. Under
</p>
<p>were the rude beds and camp-fires of the men, and
</p>
<p>in front of them a breast-work of logs, raised high
</p>
<p>enough to afford protection from any shot fired from
</p>
<p>the opposite hill. Between the upper log and that
</p>
<p>next below it, was a sort of loop-hole, made by cut
</p>
<p>ting corresponding notches in each ; and as the edges
</p>
<p>of the cliffs had been shorn of all their growth, a
</p>
<p>man could not show himself on either, without
</p>
<p>being exposed to the fatal fire of men directing their
</p>
<p>aim with a rest, and in all the coolness of perfect
</p>
<p>safety.
</p>
<p>The most curious part of the whole establishment
</p>
<p>was a sort of mill. At the point where the stream,
</p>
<p>breaking over the rocky ledge of which I have spoken,
</p>
<p>swept away around the shoulder of the platform, was
</p>
<p>placed a small log pen. The end of a shaft, pro
</p>
<p>jecting from it, overhung the water. Into this were
</p>
<p>driven stakes, fitted at one end into large auger-holes,
</p>
<p>and, at the other, spread out like a broad oar. These
</p>
<p>fan-like extremities dipped in the water, and, yield
</p>
<p>ing to its force, kept the shaft revolving night and
</p>
<p>day. Machinery equally rude connected its move
</p>
<p>ments with those of a pair of light mill-stones, which
</p>
<p>found no rest, and required no attention. Though
</p>
<p>grinding less than a bushel in the hour, it still ground
</p>
<p>on and on, affording coarse bread for the whole
</p>
<p>company and showing how true the old adage, that
</p>
<p>&quot; fair and softly go far in a day.&quot; One man was

<p>seen to replenish the hopper. Others were passing
</p>
<p>298 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and repassing, eacli with his share of meal. The
</p>
<p>whole was covered with rude boards. Exposed to the
</p>
<p>fire of each cliff, it was, of course, capable of being
</p>
<p>made to command both, and some of its features
</p>
<p>showed that it was intended to be occupied as a
</p>
<p>tower of strength in case of attack.
</p>
<p>In short, to the unpractised eye of Arthur, the
</p>
<p>whole presented the appearance of impregnable secu
</p>
<p>rity and well arranged preparation. There was
</p>
<p>indeed no present danger, but the place had been
</p>
<p>chosen and fitted with a view to the last extremity.
</p>
<p>The course of the stream, tending to the south, led
</p>
<p>in a few miles into the State of North Carolina, and
</p>
<p>in that direction there was an outlet practicable,
</p>
<p>v though difficult. Between the camp and the . State
</p>
<p>line there was no point at which the glen could
</p>
<p>be entered; and Douglas, if driven to retreat in
</p>
<p>that direction, had none but natural obstacle^ to
</p>
<p>overcome.
</p>
<p>Cold weather was now approaching, and there
</p>
<p>was no station where the troops of Douglas were so
</p>
<p>little exposed to the severity of the season as this.
</p>
<p>The soft air from the waterfall, though never warm,
</p>
<p>was never intensely cold, and no other wind but that
</p>
<p>from the south ever entered the glen. Hence as
</p>
<p>many men as were not engaged on active duty were
</p>
<p>assembled here. Still the number present was but
</p>
<p>small. Some were at the piquet, some on the scout.
</p>
<p>Besides, it was now the hunting season, and many

<p>The Partisan Leader. 299
</p>
<p>in during the course of the morning plainly
</p>
<p>showed.
</p>
<p>Arthur now looked around for Schwartz ; and hear
</p>
<p>ing his voice behind one of the breast-works, passed
</p>
<p>around the end of it, and silently joining the circle,
</p>
<p>listened to his discourse, which seemed to be a sort
</p>
<p>of military lecture.
</p>
<p>&quot; You see, boys,&quot; said he, &quot; as to tictacs, or
</p>
<p>whatever they call it, that sort of thing an t made for
</p>
<p>the like of us. When a parcel of fellows lists for
</p>
<p>soldiers, just because they an t got nothing else to
</p>
<p>do, and may be one half of them is cowards, and the
</p>
<p>other half not much better, they are obliged to have
</p>
<p>rules to go by. Because, if once you can beat it into
</p>
<p>a fellow s head that after he has got into danger it
</p>
<p>is safer for him to stand still than to run away, why
</p>
<p>then the worse scared he is the surer he will be to stay
</p>
<p>there. But it an t so with us, because if any of us
</p>
<p>was any way scary, he would riot be here no how.
</p>
<p>The only rule for us is the Indian rule.
</p>
<p>&quot; In the first place, it is our business always to
</p>
<p>know where the inirny is before he knows where we
</p>
<p>are, and .then, if we don t want to fight him, keep
</p>
<p>out of his way. Now the right way to do that, is
</p>
<p>just to squander, like a flock of partridges.
</p>
<p>&quot; Then if you are going to fight, the only rule is
</p>
<p>to give the word, and let every man kill all he can,
</p>
<p>and take care of himself the best he can. Now that
</p>
<p>way the riglars fight ; if one man in ten kills a man,

<p>they call it desperate bloody work. But I reckon if
</p>
<p>300 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>there was an inimy now coming up the valley to the
</p>
<p>foot of the Devil s Back-bone, and the word was,
</p>
<p>to kill all we could before he got there, any of us
</p>
<p>here would feel mighty cheap if he did not kill some
</p>
<p>body.
</p>
<p>&quot;And mind, boys, whether we fight or run, whether
</p>
<p>we keep together, or squander, two and two, is the
</p>
<p>word. You must all mate yourselves two and two,
</p>
<p>to stand together and run together, to fight together
</p>
<p>and die together. One of you must call himself
</p>
<p>number one, and the other number two, and then,
</p>
<p>if there s a hundred together and the inimy conies
</p>
<p>number two never fires till number one has fired and
</p>
<p>loaded again. You see, men, a fellow takes good
</p>
<p>aim, when he knows there s another one by, to hit if
</p>
<p>he misses ; and fifty rifles in that way, will do more
</p>
<p>than a hundred when every one knows that s his last
</p>
<p>chance. Fifty rifles will stop a troop of horse, and
</p>
<p>a hundred cannot do no more. But if the guns are
</p>
<p>all empty, then here comes what s left of them slash
</p>
<p>ing away with the broad-sw r ords like devils. But
</p>
<p>let there be a few more guns to pepper away at them
</p>
<p>while the first are loading, and they will go to the
</p>
<p>right-about mighty quick.
</p>
<p>&quot; Now mind what I tell you, boys, and the first
</p>
<p>time it comes to the pinch, you ll say old Schwartz
</p>
<p>didn t fight Indians so long for nothing. And as to
</p>
<p>running, any man that s afraid to run when he sees
</p>
<p>cause, is half a coward, any how. Do you run just

<p>when you please. Egad ! I d hate to depend on a
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 301
</p>
<p>man to fight that I could not trust to run. There is
</p>
<p>no harm in running, if you know where you are run
</p>
<p>ning to, and your friends know it too ; and the right
</p>
<p>way is to fix a place, every morning, to meet at
</p>
<p>night, and let every man get there as he can, and do
</p>
<p>what mischief he can. But, mind, if it comes to
</p>
<p>that, always run two and two, and then one can help
</p>
<p>another ; and if one comes up missing, the other can
</p>
<p>tell what s become of him.
</p>
<p>&quot; I m telling our boys,&quot; continued Schwartz, who
</p>
<p>now observed Arthur, &quot; some of the lessons I learned
</p>
<p>among the Shawnees. You see, Mr. Arthur (you
</p>
<p>must not think strange of my calling you so, sir, for
</p>
<p>all your family seem like my own flesh and blood to
</p>
<p>me for all you don t know how that is) ; you see,
</p>
<p>sir, the Captain is a regular officer, built plumb from
</p>
<p>the ground up ; but for all that, he knows that all this
</p>
<p>is true ; and, before now, when he and I have been
</p>
<p>sitting over the fire, at night, he has told me about
</p>
<p>one Gineral Braddock, I think they called him, that
</p>
<p>got his men shot all to pieces, and himself too, just
</p>
<p>because he would not believe that there was any other
</p>
<p>way to fight but just his way. Now, you see, sir, the
</p>
<p>reason why he was taken at an onplush was, that he
</p>
<p>was fighting agin Indians. Well, suppose we fight
</p>
<p>Indian-fashion ; will not that be pretty much the same
</p>
<p>thing? May be we an t exactly up to that, but we
</p>
<p>must do the best we can ; for as to fighting the riglars

<p>the sun shines.

</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mind that night,&quot; continued Schwartz,
</p>
<p>laughing, &quot; when the Lieutenant and his men came
</p>
<p>there to your uncle s to take him and the Captain ?
</p>
<p>That was Indian play for you. Egad ! if I had not
</p>
<p>heard that the Colonel was there, I should have
</p>
<p>knowed he was at the fixing of that business. You
</p>
<p>see, sir, that is what a man learns by living in places
</p>
<p>where a body is never safe ; and the upshot of it is,
</p>
<p>that after a while he gets so that he never can be in
</p>
<p>any danger. It s like learning to sleep with one eye
</p>
<p>always open.&quot;
</p>
<p>Schwartz now rose from the ground, where he had
</p>
<p>been sitting, and brushing the ashes from his leathers,
</p>
<p>joined Arthur, and they repaired to the tent where
</p>
<p>their simple meal awaited them. From him the youth

<p>learned that his brother had repaired to the piquet at

<p>Sufficient for itself its own reward.

<p>Why think of him I An honorable fool,

<p>He seeks no other guerdon.

<p>ANONYMOUS.
</p>
<p>DOUGLAS was at the piquet long enough before the
</p>
<p>arrival of his guest, to make such arrangements as
</p>
<p>should prevent the stranger from suspecting that this
</p>
<p>was not the camp he was desirous to see. He had no
</p>
<p>mind that his enemy should know the real nature and
</p>
<p>precise position of his main stronghold. Plence he
</p>
<p>had determined to give him the meeting at the piquet,
</p>
<p>and took pains to provide, as if for his own ordinary
</p>
<p>accommodation, such a breakfast as he would have
</p>
<p>been content to furnish at his own quarters for the
</p>
<p>most honored visiter.
</p>
<p>The spy, who had learned little of his profession
</p>
<p>but that self-indulgent art which is technically called
</p>
<p>&quot; playing old soldier,&quot; had been in no haste to leave
</p>
<p>his rest, and Witt, who understood Schwartz s game,
</p>
<p>did not hurry him. The breakfast hour, therefore,
</p>
<p>had fully arrived before he made his appearance. He

</p>
<p>came accompanied by Witt and another of his party ;
</p>
<p>304 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and, in appearance and manners, fully answered the
</p>
<p>description of him given by Schwartz. He was a tall,
</p>
<p>red-haired man, vain, pert, and full of self-complacency.
</p>
<p>Indeed, so much did he display of a satisfaction, at
</p>
<p>once chuckling and childish, that Douglas, even
</p>
<p>though unwarned, must have suspected treachery.
</p>
<p>Besides, he never could have believed a being, mani
</p>
<p>festly so frivolous and foolish, capable of the high pur
</p>
<p>pose of devoting himself to a life of toil, hardship, and
</p>
<p>danger. The vain and self-indulgent may receive
</p>
<p>momentary impulses, under the influence of which
</p>
<p>brilliant achievements may be suddenly accomplished ;
</p>
<p>but from such the tasks of study, virtue, and enduring
</p>
<p>courage, must never be expected.
</p>
<p>He seemed, at first, more intent upon his breakfast
</p>
<p>than anything else, and when it appeared, made faces
</p>
<p>at his coarse fare which ill accorded with his -professed
</p>
<p>indifference to all personal inconvenience. But, bad
</p>
<p>as it was, he contrived to swallow enough to show
</p>
<p>that he was not prepared to play the ascetic any more
</p>
<p>in regard to the quantity than the quality of his food*
</p>
<p>&quot; You see,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; the life we lead. If you
</p>
<p>are not prepared to submit cheerfully to privations,
</p>
<p>compared to which what you see here is luxury, you
</p>
<p>should not join us.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Damn luxury,&quot; said the other. &quot; What do I care
</p>
<p>about luxury ? To be sure, I have been used to it all
</p>
<p>rny life ; coffee or tea, one, every morning for break
</p>
<p>fast ; and good light bread, and potatoes, and pies ;

</p>
<p>least every day in the week, and all sorts of sass, and
</p>
<p>then pies again, and cheese, a#d all that. But I am
</p>
<p>ready to give it all up to serve my country, and live
</p>
<p>as hard as any body.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am glad to hear it,&quot; said Douglas, drawing
</p>
<p>some papers from his pocket. Among these he
</p>
<p>affected to search in vain for a particular paper, and
</p>
<p>in doing so, carelessly threw on the table the letter
</p>
<p>endorsed with the name Job Dixon. He saw that it
</p>
<p>caught the other s eyes, and, expressing some dissatis
</p>
<p>faction at his own carelessness, said : &quot; You have a
</p>
<p>right to know, before you join us, all about our force,
</p>
<p>and I ought to show you my last return ; but I have
</p>
<p>it not at hand, though I believe I know pretty well
</p>
<p>the number of my men. But stay,&quot; continued he,
</p>
<p>interrupting himself with a start, and looking at the
</p>
<p>gallant Captain with a keenness that made his very
</p>
<p>back ache, &quot; how came you by my pass- words, sir?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I got them from a man they call Job Dixon,&quot;
</p>
<p>replied the trembling Captain.
</p>
<p>&quot; Job Dixon !&quot; replied Douglas, immediately resum
</p>
<p>ing his complacency ; &quot; then all is right.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; O yes ! all is right,&quot; said the other, recovering
</p>
<p>from his alarm, but more fluttered and confused than
</p>
<p>ever. &quot; He told me that wa nt his name, sure enough,
</p>
<p>and he said that name was only a sort of a countersign
</p>
<p>to you.&quot;
</p>
<p>It cost Douglas some effort to suppress a smile at
</p>
<p>seeing the delicate and dangerous office of a spy

</p>
<p>necessary to it ; but he commanded himself, and
</p>
<p>asked whether the other was now content to join him.
</p>
<p>&quot; To be sure I am,&quot; said he ; &quot; and not only I, but
</p>
<p>fifty more as good fellows as ever stepped shoe-
</p>
<p>leather. You see, that was what I doubted about.
</p>
<p>I thought may be as I had such a company, I had a
</p>
<p>right to set up for myself; but after I heard all about
</p>
<p>you from that man, Job Dixon, or whatever else
</p>
<p>his name is, I made up my mind to join you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Where are your men ?&quot; asked Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot;They are all about home yet,&quot; said the Captain,
</p>
<p>&quot; but I can bring them together any day, and any
</p>
<p>place you please to name. I suppose you don t
</p>
<p>mean to stay up here in the mountains all the time,
</p>
<p>and may be it might suit as well for me to fall in
</p>
<p>with you somewhere.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is true,&quot; said Douglas, &quot; We are not so
</p>
<p>well off here for rations, as to want any body before
</p>
<p>we have use for them. As long as we stay here we
</p>
<p>are strong enough. A regiment- of men could not
</p>
<p>climb the Devil s Back-bone before our faces. But
</p>
<p>I propose to move shortly, and should be glad of a
</p>
<p>reinforcement on the way. What county are your
</p>
<p>men in ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; In Bedford county,&quot; replied the other, repeating
</p>
<p>his lesson exactly.
</p>
<p>&quot; That will do, then,&quot; said Douglas. &quot; I propose
</p>
<p>to march agaipst Mason, at Lyncbburg, early in
</p>
<p>November, and on the fifth day of the month I will

<p>meet vou at Jones s Ford, on Staunton river.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 307
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say that I know exactly where that is,&quot;
</p>
<p>said the spy.
</p>
<p>&quot; It is little out of your way into any part of Bed
</p>
<p>ford county,&quot; said Douglas ; &quot; and as I want to see
</p>
<p>some of our friends down in that quarter, I will ride
</p>
<p>there with you. I am told Mason is pretty strong,
</p>
<p>and I want to get all the force I can, and that is not
</p>
<p>so much but what I shall be glad of your help.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How many men have you ?&quot; asked the Yankee
</p>
<p>Captain.
</p>
<p>&quot; I have but a handful here, just now ; but I am
</p>
<p>sending out orders for more to join on the route, and
</p>
<p>I am in hopes to reach the river with four hundred
</p>
<p>at least. I shall stay there, at all events, till more
</p>
<p>come in ; because it would be foolish to attack
</p>
<p>Mason s regiment with less than five or six hundred.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That will do,&quot; said the other ; &quot; for Mason is
</p>
<p>not more than four hundred strong.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Indeed !&quot; replied Douglas, affecting surprise
</p>
<p>and pleasure. &quot; Then I am pretty sure of him. I
</p>
<p>had heard as much before, but I don t trust every
</p>
<p>body. I was afraid there was a trap set for me ; but
</p>
<p>now I am satisfied, and if I can leave Staunton river
</p>
<p>with six hundred men, I shall gather force enough
</p>
<p>before I get to Lynchburg to drive Mason and his
</p>
<p>regiment before me like chaff.&quot;
</p>
<p>Having said this, Douglas set about the necessary
</p>
<p>arrangements for accompanying his new acquaint
</p>

<p>great for one day, he proposed to pass the night at
</p>
<p>308 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>the house of a trusty friend, from whence the Yankee
</p>
<p>officer would have it in his power to reach a tavern,
</p>
<p>two miles beyond the river, the next day. He now
</p>
<p>despatched a note to Arthur, saying that he wished
</p>
<p>to examine the ground at the river, in company with
</p>
<p>him and Schwartz. He therefore directed them to
</p>
<p>follow at a cautious distance, so as not to be seen
</p>
<p>by the spy ; to pass them in the night, and take up
</p>
<p>their quarters at a house in advance, and the next
</p>
<p>day proceed to the dwelling of Mr. Gordon (a
</p>
<p>staunch friend), near the river, and wait for him
</p>
<p>there. Meantime a horse, that stood piqueted hard
</p>
<p>by, was saddled, and Douglas set out, accompanied
</p>
<p>by the treacherous Captain and the faithful Witt.
</p>
<p>The journey was made without any occurrence
</p>
<p>worth noting. In the conversation of the stranger
</p>
<p>there was nothing to beguile Douglas from his own
</p>
<p>thoughts. The vain babble of the prating coxcomb
</p>
<p>was all wasted on the impenetrable Witt ; and, after
</p>
<p>a few fruitless attempts to overcome the taciturnity
</p>
<p>of his companions, he followed their example, and
</p>
<p>the greater part of the journey was made in silence.
</p>
<p>Late on the second evening they reached the river.
</p>
<p>The spy was directed to the public-house on the
</p>
<p>other side, and Douglas and Witt returned to Mr.
</p>
<p>Gordon s, where they found Arthur and Schwartz.
</p>
<p>As they were now in a land of civilization and
</p>
<p>comfort, Douglas was not sorry to obtain, once more,
</p>
<p>a good night s lodging, which his hospitable friend

</p>
<p>was delighted to afford. But this rare enjoyment did
</p>
<p>The* Partisan Leader. 309
</p>
<p>not make him forgetful of the necessity of watching
</p>
<p>the motions of his enemy. He accordingly despatched
</p>
<p>a scout to the house to which the Yankee had been
</p>
<p>directed, to make sure that he had gone on.
</p>
<p>At a late hour the man returned, and roused
</p>
<p>Douglas to inform him that the spy had indeed gone
</p>
<p>as far as he had intended, and that he had there
</p>
<p>fallen in with a party of a dozen dragoons, com
</p>
<p>manded by a subaltern, who were on a scout through
</p>
<p>the country. With this officer he had been seen to be
</p>
<p>engaged in private and earnest conversation, and
</p>
<p>orders had been issued to the men to look well to
</p>
<p>the condition of their arms, and to be in readiness
</p>
<p>to move at day-light.
</p>
<p>It at once occurred to Douglas that a new scheme
</p>
<p>had entered the head of the vain and frivolous being
</p>
<p>who had thrust himself into an affair requiring
</p>
<p>qualities so different. It was probable that he wished
</p>
<p>to avail himself of the presence of this little party to
</p>
<p>endeavor to surprise his enemy, whom he had reason
</p>
<p>to believe to be still near the Ford. The folly of risk
</p>
<p>ing the defeat of his favorite enterprise by joining in
</p>
<p>the attempt, and thus throwing off his mask, was not
</p>
<p>likely to occur to him. The question with Douglas
</p>
<p>was, whether by abiding the attack he should afford
</p>
<p>the bungling fool, whom he had been leading into
</p>
<p>his own trap, a chance to escape from it by his own
</p>
<p>blunder. In this apprehension, however, he did not
</p>
<p>give that worthy due credit for his discretion. He

</p>
<p>had indeed considered Douglas as his proper prey ;
</p>
<p>31 o The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and though he had been unable to restrain his dispo
</p>
<p>sition to babble, he sorely repented his indiscretion,
</p>
<p>when he found the other officer disposed to antici
</p>
<p>pate him. He had accordingly earnestly dissuaded
</p>
<p>him from attempting any thing ; and, not prevailing
</p>
<p>in this, had determined to go on alone, and leave
</p>
<p>the other to execute his project as he might.
</p>
<p>But though uncertain what might be the conduct
</p>
<p>of the spy, Douglas could not resist his inclination to
</p>
<p>throw himself in the way of the expected attack. It
</p>
<p>was necessary that he should examine the ground
</p>
<p>carefully, and he had not time to wait until the scout
</p>
<p>ing party should have left the neighborhood. Besides,
</p>
<p>he was anxious to inform himself precisely of the force
</p>
<p>and position of the enemy, and the name of their new
</p>
<p>commander. For this purpose he was eager to make
</p>
<p>at least one prisoner. And, after all, perhaps not the
</p>
<p>least moving consideration, was his desire to taste
</p>
<p>once more the stormy joy of battle.
</p>
<p>Upon the whole, he determined to turn the tables
</p>
<p>on his enemy, if possible ; and, instead of returning to
</p>
<p>bed, prepared immediately for action. All things
</p>
<p>were soon ready. The master of the house, his two
</p>
<p>sons, and three of the neighbors, who, hearing that
</p>
<p>he was there, had called to see him, added to his own
</p>
<p>party, made a force of ten men, with which he was
</p>
<p>not afraid to abide the attack of thirteen. At the
</p>
<p>nead of these he took the road, and by daylight had
</p>
<p>occupied the ground where he wished to meet the

<p>enemy.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader 311
</p>
<p>At the point of which we speak, the road, after
</p>
<p>passing for some miles over a broad and level ridge,
</p>
<p>at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the river,
</p>
<p>dives suddenly into a steep defile between two hills.
</p>
<p>The descent is rapid, and, in less than a hundred
</p>
<p>yards, the hills come down abruptly on either hand,
</p>
<p>leaving between them barely space enough for the
</p>
<p>road, which is quite narrow. They are steep, rugged,
</p>
<p>with projecting rocks, and altogether impracticable to
</p>
<p>cavalry; and are moreover covered with a heavy
</p>
<p>growth of timber and brushwood. At the distance of
</p>
<p>about two hundred yards from the plain above, the
</p>
<p>road turns sharp to the right. It then pursues a coarse
</p>
<p>nearly direct, for a like distance ; and then, turning
</p>
<p>short to the left, the river, ford, and the opposite
</p>
<p>landing, are at once in full view.
</p>
<p>A point a little below the first mentioned bend was
</p>
<p>selected by Douglas for his position. He posted Witt
</p>
<p>and three others on one side of the road, behind rocks
</p>
<p>and trees, while he, Arthur, and one more, disposed
</p>
<p>themselves, in like manner, on the other. Schwartz,
</p>
<p>with the rest, passed through the defile, with orders to
</p>
<p>hide themselves near the bank, and let the enemy pass
</p>
<p>without interruption. A pole had been thrown across
</p>
<p>the road, some twenty yards in front of Douglas and
</p>
<p>his party. The crossing of this, by the enemy, was to
</p>
<p>be the signal for firing. The officer was designated
</p>
<p>to be the mark of Witt. The right and left hand man
</p>
<p>of the leading file, had each his appropriate execu
</p>
<p>tioner appointed ; then the two next, and then two

</p>
<p>more, were in like manner foredoomed, so that no shot
</p>
<p>should be thrown away. While these arrangements
</p>
<p>were making, Arthur bethought him of Schwartz s
</p>
<p>lecture on tactics, and was at once sensible of the vast
</p>
<p>superiority of untaught courage and sagacity, on occa
</p>
<p>sions like this, over the sort of discipline on which the
</p>
<p>martinet is so apt to pride himself.
</p>
<p>About sunrise, the enemy appeared, consisting, as
</p>
<p>the scout had said, of a dozen men, under the com
</p>
<p>mand of a single officer. . To the great relief of Dou
</p>
<p>glas, the redoubtable Yankee Captain was not with
</p>
<p>them. As the hill was steep, they advanced in a walk,
</p>
<p>while the officer, who was in the rear, occasionally
</p>
<p>turned his horse s head to the hill, seeming to examine
</p>
<p>for some recess in which his party might draw aside,
</p>
<p>and form a sort of ambuscade. But there was no such
</p>
<p>spot. The ground was every where too steep for caval
</p>
<p>ry ; and, disappointed, he put spurs to his horse, and
</p>
<p>pushed forward to resume his place at the head of the
</p>
<p>party. They were now near the fatal point ; every
</p>
<p>rifle was in rest, and duly levelled at its mark, and in
</p>
<p>the moment that the leading file were crossing the
</p>
<p>pole, six saddles were emptied, and six horses ran
</p>
<p>masterless. The aim of Witt at the officer, who was
</p>
<p>much more distant, and moving rapidly, was less fatal.
</p>
<p>But his ball took effect, as was plainly shown by the
</p>
<p>sword arm, which, at the moment, fell powerless. The
</p>
<p>men went to the right-about in a moment, and a shout,
</p>
<p>which the echoes of the steep gorge multiplied into.

</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>The officer, though wounded, was not quite so
</p>
<p>ready to take to his heels, and called to his men to
</p>
<p>halt. With all but one, he succeeded ; but that one,
</p>
<p>wild with terror, dashed on. In the mean time,
</p>
<p>Schwartz and his little party had planted themselves
</p>
<p>in the road, near the river, and their array was the
</p>
<p>first object that met the eye of the affrighted soldier
</p>
<p>as he turned the angle of the road. But panic is as
</p>
<p>apt to hurry a man into danger as away from it, and
</p>
<p>the sight of this new enemy only urged the poor
</p>
<p>wretch to a more desperate effort to escape, by break
</p>
<p>ing by them. In vain did the men throw up their arms,
</p>
<p>and call to him to stop. He rushed on, right upon
</p>
<p>Schwartz, who stood in the middle of the road, and
</p>
<p>who, as a dernier ressort, stopped his career with a bul
</p>
<p>let. The report of his rifle, and a glimpse of Dou
</p>
<p>glas s men advancing along the side of the hill to get
</p>
<p>M r ithin shot, decided the officer that it was time to look
</p>
<p>to his safety. Turning the angle of the road, he saw
</p>
<p>the fate of his fallen soldief, and the cause of it.
</p>
<p>Immediately calling on his men to follow, he dashed
</p>
<p>on with an impetuosity which showed a determination
</p>
<p>to force a passage or perish.
</p>
<p>The result was inevitably. Schwartz was in the
</p>
<p>act of loading his rifle. The other three levelled
</p>
<p>theirs. They had not been trained in Schwartz s
</p>
<p>school of tactics, and all three, attracted by the epau
</p>
<p>lette and plume and sash of the officer, fired at
</p>
<p>him. He fell dead, and the rest, perceiving their

</p>
<p>314 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>necessity, sprang aside, and let them pass. One of
</p>
<p>them was not so nimble, but that, as he clambered
</p>
<p>up the rocky face of the hill, a sweeping back-handed
</p>
<p>stroke inflicted a deep gash in the back part of his
</p>
<p>thigh. This was the only injury received by the
</p>
<p>party of Douglas in the affair, and dearly did it cost
</p>
<p>the man who gave it. Schwartz marked him, and
</p>
<p>coolly went on loading his rifle. By the time he had
</p>
<p>effected this, the soldier was half way across the
</p>
<p>river, and, the next moment, tumbled from his horse,
</p>
<p>and went floating down the stream. The other five
</p>
<p>gained the shore before another rifle could be loaded,

<p>and doubling a rocky point around which the road

<p>CHAPTEE XXXY.
</p>
<p>THIS victory,, though on a small scale, was com
</p>
<p>plete in itself. It was a favorable omen, too, and
</p>
<p>might serve as a sort of rehearsal of the more im
</p>
<p>portant battle to be fought on the same ground. Tn
</p>
<p>one thing only Douglas had been disappointed, by
</p>
<p>the eagerness of Schwartz s men. He had made
</p>
<p>no prisoners, and the fallen enemy were all either
</p>
<p>dead, or not in condition to be harassed by such
</p>
<p>questions as he wished to ask. They were necessa
</p>
<p>rily committed to the care of such of the party as
</p>
<p>lived in the neighborhood ; and their horses and arms
</p>
<p>being secured, were placed in the same hands for
</p>
<p>safe keeping.
</p>
<p>The feelings of Arthur, as he looked on this fearful
</p>
<p>scene of slaughter, were such as might be expected
</p>
<p>to possess the mind of a youth, who, as yet, had
</p>
<p>never seen the blood of man shed in strife. But
</p>
<p>these are nothing to the purpose of my tale. It is
</p>
<p>enough to say, that the contemplation of it wrought
</p>
<p>the usual change in his character. He now felt that
</p>
<p>to kill or be killed was the order of the day ; and,
</p>
<p>though his next sleep was haunted by visions of the

<p>ghastly objects that lay before him, he awoke from
</p>
<p>31 6 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>it with, a mind prepared for the stern duties of
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>Requesting the company and advice of his host,
</p>
<p>Douglas now proceeded to examine the ground. He
</p>
<p>found the river hills every where intersected, on
</p>
<p>both sides of the river, by ravines such as that I
</p>
<p>have described. The ford was shallow, but just
</p>
<p>above was deep water, which, on -the north side,
</p>
<p>came down quite near to the gravel bar, which served
</p>
<p>as a dam. Here a steep and high rock bounded the
</p>
<p>river, and along the base of it, the water eddied in a
</p>
<p>deep pool, and then swept away in a strong but
</p>
<p>shallow current. At a short distance below was
</p>
<p>the mouth of a ravine, overgrown with lofty trees,
</p>
<p>and clustering with brushwood, at a distance of fifty
</p>
<p>yards from the landing place. The road, issuing
</p>
<p>from the river at the foot of the rock, holds a straight
</p>
<p>course for twenty yards, or thereabouts, and then
</p>
<p>turning short to the left, is no more in sight of the
</p>
<p>river. From thence a short but steep ascent through
</p>
<p>a deep cleft in the hills, brings the traveller to the
</p>
<p>top, where he turns again to the right, and resumes
</p>
<p>the direction towards Lynchburg. After a thorough
</p>
<p>examination of the whole, the party returned to
</p>
<p>breakfast at the house of Mr. Gordon.
</p>
<p>Douglas rode slowly and thoughtfully. At length
</p>
<p>lie said apart to Schwartz :
</p>
<p>&quot; Your plot is admirable ; but I am afraid it will
</p>
<p>fail.&quot;

</p>
<p>&quot; What chance of that ?&quot; asked Schwartz. &quot; They
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 317
</p>
<p>will be ashamed to bring more than a thousand men
</p>
<p>against you, even if they had them. &quot;We can raise
</p>
<p>as many as they can, and we shall be on the ground,
</p>
<p>and have the same advantage we had just now.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But suppose they come and take possession
</p>
<p>first,&quot; said Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Oh ! no danger of that. They ll be in no hurry
</p>
<p>to leave their snug quarters any sooner than they
</p>
<p>can help ; and we can be here a day or two before
</p>
<p>the time.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It may be so,&quot; said Douglas; &quot;but I don t
</p>
<p>think Col. Mason takes me for an absolute fool ; and
</p>
<p>if he does, he has reason to know that I have sharp-
</p>
<p>witted men about me. But any man s wits may fail
</p>
<p>him sometimes. For example, it has never occurred
</p>
<p>to either of us, that Mason will certainly not believe
</p>
<p>that we have been fooled by such a fellow as this
</p>
<p>Yankee of yours. Will he not, therefore, at once
</p>
<p>suspect the truth, and conclude that we are trying
</p>
<p>to catch him in his own trap ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Egad !&quot; said Schwartz, &quot; that is true. I had
</p>
<p>not thought of that. The fellow is too silly to be
</p>
<p>made bait of, sure enough. But then, you see,
</p>
<p>Captain, we can fix them any how. Mr. Gordon
</p>
<p>here can raise men enough, in three days, to keep
</p>
<p>them from crossing the river, until we are ready for
</p>
<p>them ; and then you know, we can push across a
</p>
<p>part of our men, and toll them over. If once we
</p>
<p>get them into a right sharp fight, they ll follow us

<p>across the river fast enough.&quot;
</p>
<p>318 The Partisan Leader
</p>
<p>&quot; I have no doubt of their coming to look for us,
</p>
<p>said Douglas ; &quot; and no doubt of a fight ; but we
</p>
<p>must be prepared to meet more men than we have
</p>
<p>bargained for. Depend upon it, they will bring
</p>
<p>every man they can raise. Why, would you believe
</p>
<p>it, the fellow talked to me about living at home on
</p>
<p>codfish, and potatoes, and cider, and pies, and all
</p>
<p>sorts of sass? Such a simpleton could not impose
</p>
<p>on a child. Col. Mason has talents worthy of a
</p>
<p>better cause, and he will see through the whole affair.
</p>
<p>I suppose he is superseded ; but he is an honorable
</p>
<p>man, and will frankly give the benefit of his suspi
</p>
<p>cions to his superior, who can hardly be such a fool
</p>
<p>as to disregard his suggestions. We must bestir
</p>
<p>ourselves, therefore, or give up the game and escape
</p>
<p>from our own plot.

<p>&quot; Gentlemen,&quot; continued Douglas, speaking aloud,
</p>
<p>and in a sustained and decisive tone, &quot; this is our
</p>
<p>place of rendezvous ; the time mid-day on the third
</p>
<p>of November. Every man must come prepared for

<p>action, and such as mean to accompany me to the
</p>
<p>lower country, must bring with them all their neces

<p>saries. Mr. Gordon, I must depend on you to hold
</p>
<p>this pass, and keep the enemy from crossing the
</p>
<p>river. I shall send a force to support you, if neces
</p>
<p>sary. You, Schwartz, know what to do better than
</p>
<p>I can tell you. You, Witt, will return with me, arid
</p>
<p>we will talk as we ride, of what is to be done. Mr.

</p>
<p>and then we part until the day of rendezvous. Until
</p>
<p>that time, Vigilance and Activity is the word ; but
</p>
<p>then, i FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, and GLORY. :
</p>
<p>As Douglas said this they arrived at Mr. Gordon s
</p>
<p>door. The ready meal was hastily swallowed, the
</p>
<p>horses fed, and they departed for the camp. On the
</p>
<p>way Schwartz, turning to the left, kept a southward
</p>
<p>course through the district, along the foot of the
</p>
<p>mountains, to rouse the inhabitants in that quarter,
</p>
<p>and to collect a party to support Mr. Gordon. The
</p>
<p>rest returned to the camp, from whence runners
</p>
<p>were despatched throughout all the adjacent coun

<p>try, and even beyond the mountain to the head
</p>

<p>enemy.
</p>
<p>In the handsome parlor of a handsome house, in
</p>
<p>the suburbs of Lynchburg, we find two officers
</p>
<p>seated at a game of piquet. The hour is nine at
</p>
<p>night. The room is richly furnished. A bright fire
</p>
<p>burns on the hearth, and the blaze of sconce and
</p>
<p>astral lamps sheds its soft, luxurious, moonlight
</p>
<p>beams into every corner. &quot;Wine, cordials, fruits,
</p>
<p>and cigars, are placed on a table, and every thing
</p>
<p>betokens comfort and luxury, ease and indolence.
</p>
<p>The dress of these officers corresponds with the
</p>
<p>scene. Both glitter with gold and flutter in lace,
</p>
<p>and their richly mounted swords and highly finished
</p>
<p>pistols, which lie on the table, show that the owners

</p>
<p>Such was indeed the fact. The pay of the army,
</p>
<p>gradually increased by law during thirty years, had
</p>
<p>grown to a noble revenue. The emoluments, as they
</p>
<p>are called, under a system of fraud and connivance,
</p>
<p>had advanced (without law) yet more rapidly ; so
</p>
<p>that to be a Colonel in the army of the United States
</p>
<p>was to be a rich man. Such was the rank of both
</p>
<p>these officers. It was true that the treasury had
</p>
<p>already begun to feel the drain of the vast sums
</p>
<p>accumulated under an iniquitous tariff, and now
</p>
<p>employed to fortify the tyranny that had enforced
</p>
<p>that pernicious system. The loss of the southern
</p>
<p>trade gave reason to fear that the supply now on
</p>
<p>hand, if once exhausted, would not be speedily
</p>
<p>renewed. But the rulers felt but the more sensibly
</p>
<p>that the energetic employment both of force and
</p>
<p>corruption was necessary to retain the little that
</p>
<p>remained, by holding Virginia in subjection. With
</p>
<p>this view, the same system of wasteful expenditure,
</p>
<p>commenced twenty years before, was kept up ; and
</p>
<p>all who served the crown with becoming zeal were
</p>
<p>encouraged to hold open their mouths that they
</p>
<p>might be filled.
</p>
<p>In another part of the room a company of subal
</p>
<p>terns fluttered around a bevy of fair damsels. To
</p>
<p>these young ladies the mistress of this mansion had
</p>
<p>of late become an ohject of much increased regard.
</p>

<p>visit did she receive, since the abounding loyalty of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 321
</p>
<p>her husband had invited the commandant of the post
</p>
<p>to make it his head-quarters. Many a wistful glance
</p>
<p>had been cast during the evening, from the assiduous
</p>
<p>subalterns, toward the handsome and unheeding
</p>
<p>wearer of two epaulettes, to whose authority all who
</p>
<p>approached him were bound to bow. But it was all
</p>
<p>in vain. Sufficient to himself, he valued not the
</p>
<p>admiring eyes which were bent upon him ; or if they
</p>
<p>occupied any thing of his attention, it was to be
</p>
<p>made the subject of invidious comparison with the
</p>
<p>ladies of the highest fashion in the northern cities,
</p>
<p>whose lavish attentions had rendered him totally
</p>
<p>heedless of the vulgar admiration of a parcel of hall-
</p>
<p>bred Virginia girls.
</p>
<p>These remarks, however, apply to only one of the
</p>
<p>officers in question. The other manifested no such
</p>
<p>insensibility, though his attentions to the fair were
</p>
<p>only marked by a staid courtesy, hardly more flat
</p>
<p>tering than the perfect indifference of his companion.
</p>
<p>Still he paid such attention as it becomes a gentle
</p>
<p>man to pay to every thing that wears the exterior of
</p>
<p>a lady. But the day when he was himself an object
</p>
<p>of court to them was past. Indeed, the ladies had
</p>
<p>already begun to despair of thawing the coldness of
</p>
<p>his temperament, when being superseded by a
</p>
<p>younger and handsomer commander, he was laid on
</p>
<p>the shelf and condemned as quite passe.

<p>he has been introduced.
</p>
<p>322 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>The reader, without doubt, already understands
</p>
<p>that, of the two officers before us, the elder in years,
</p>
<p>though the younger in commission, is Col. Mason,
</p>
<p>late commandant of the post. His companion is
</p>
<p>Col. Owen Trevor, whose impatience for distinction
</p>
<p>has been indulged by sending him to Lynchburg
</p>
<p>with his regiment. Here, taking rank of Mason, he
</p>
<p>has been in fact placed in command of a brigade,
</p>
<p>w T ith an understanding that time and opportunity
</p>
<p>will be afforded him to show himself qualified for the
</p>
<p>rank, by discharging the functions of a brigadier.
</p>
<p>This post has been assigned him because in this
</p>
<p>direction is the only enemy actually in arms.
</p>
<p>Although the force under the command of Douglas
</p>
<p>had been originally but a handful, Mason had seen
</p>
<p>that it possessed, in a marvellous degree, the faculty
</p>
<p>of occasional expansion. His intelligence had taught
</p>
<p>him to expect that, it would ere long be greatly
</p>
<p>increased, if not crushed by a vigorous movement
</p>
<p>on his part. Hence he was desirous of acting on the
</p>
<p>offensive, especially as he had no doubt, from the
</p>
<p>past, that Lynchburg was the object of Douglas. But
</p>
<p>he had seen enough of the character and resources
</p>
<p>of his enemy to know that a small force would be
</p>
<p>unavailing, and had therefore earnestly desired to
</p>
<p>be reinforced. In answer to this request he had
</p>
<p>Deceived, not the moderate aid that he had desired,
</p>
<p>but an order to surrender his command to Col.

<p>to the post.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 323
</p>
<p>Col. Mason was a man of honor and talent. He
</p>
<p>was one of the many subjects of that strong delusion
</p>
<p>which had so extensively prevailed ; and, under the
</p>
<p>influence of which, Virginia, for thirty years, had
</p>
<p>been sacrificing the substance of liberty and pros
</p>
<p>perity to the forms of a constitution devised to
</p>
<p>secure, but perverted to destroy them. He belonged,
</p>
<p>moreover, to that unfortunate class of partisans whom
</p>
<p>it is safe to neglect. Acting on principles, however
</p>
<p>erroneous, it was clearly seen that these alone were
</p>
<p>sufficient to bind him to the service to which he had
</p>
<p>devoted himself. It was at the same time little
</p>
<p>doubted that a change of opinions would be followed
</p>
<p>by a renunciation of all the advantages of his situa
</p>
<p>tion, whatever they might be. To waste on such a
</p>
<p>man the means of corrupting the corruptible, and
</p>
<p>securing the faithless, would indeed have been
</p>
<p>&quot;ridiculous excess.&quot; He had- won his way to his
</p>
<p>present rank by the strict performance of every duty
</p>
<p>of the subordinate offices, through which he had
</p>
<p>risen by regular gradation. In the shuffling and
</p>
<p>cutting of the military pack, he had seen junior
</p>
<p>officers placed above him by that sort of legerde
</p>
<p>main which had so long before procured his master
</p>
<p>the name of the magician. He had not indeed
</p>
<p>acquiesced tamely in this, but means had been
</p>
<p>always found to soothe him, and he had been
</p>
<p>retained in the service by dexterous appeals to that
</p>
<p>magnanimity which they who knew not how to

<p>appreciate, yet knew well how to play upon.

</p>
<p>But lie had not yet forgotten how, ten years
</p>
<p>before, some pretext had been found for reversing
</p>
<p>the relative rank of himself and Col. Trevor, when
</p>
<p>both were very young and both subalterns. But on
</p>
<p>that occasion, as usual, some complimentary though
</p>
<p>temporary arrangement had been devised to recon
</p>
<p>cile him to that which gave the rank of Captain to
</p>
<p>one, whom he, still a Lieutenant, had once com

<p>manded. Having repressed his dissatisfaction at
</p>
<p>that time, he now felt bound to acquiesce in the
</p>
<p>circumstances which placed his former subordinate
</p>
<p>immediately in authority over him. If this occur
</p>
<p>rence made him repent his former tameness, now
</p>
<p>when it was too late to remonstrate, he did not say

<p>so, but addressed himself with grave precision to

<p>CHAPTEE XXXVI.
</p>
<p>Fortuna nimium quern fovet, stultum facit.
</p>
<p>COLONEL TREVOR was the spoiled child of fortune
</p>
<p>and patronage. He was old enough to remember his
</p>
<p>father s rise in life. Hence, in estimating his conse
</p>
<p>quence in society, he had formed a habit of comparing
</p>
<p>him with the class from which he sprung, and not
</p>
<p>with that more intellectual order of men, in which he
</p>
<p>had at last found his proper place, and where he had
</p>
<p>long remained stationary in well ascertained equality.
</p>
<p>This circumstance alone made an important difference
</p>
<p>between him and his younger brothers. The sort of
</p>
<p>retrospect with which he was most familiar teaches
</p>
<p>any thing but humility, however it may impress that
</p>
<p>lesson on the mind that has already learned it.
</p>
<p>In the commencement of Col. Trevor s military
</p>
<p>career, the approbation of his father had been of
</p>
<p>more consequence to the usurper than now, when his
</p>
<p>throne stood strong on its own foundations. The
</p>
<p>character of that worthy gentleman, too, had been
</p>
<p>less understood. The President had not been aware
</p>
<p>how absolutely the convictions of his own mind and
</p>
<p>his high sense of duty supplied the place of those

</p>
<p>pectation of which is necessary to bind the faith of
</p>
<p>the unprincipled. Before this discovery was made,
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor had been already advanced to a rank,
</p>
<p>and invested with an adventitious consequence,
</p>
<p>which made it important to cultivate him on his own
</p>
<p>account. His early training had taught him the
</p>
<p>grand maxim of the court : u Nothing ask, nothing
</p>
<p>have.&quot; He had discovered that any display of fixed
</p>
<p>principle, however favorable to the usurper s plans,
</p>
<p>was no passport to advancement ; that rewards were
</p>
<p>only for the mercenary, and that they were always
</p>
<p>dispensed with a freedom duly proportioned to the
</p>
<p>eagerness with which they were sought. The caustic
</p>
<p>wit of John Kandolph had unintentionally and almost
</p>
<p>with his last breath supplied the faction with a coun
</p>
<p>tersign not to be mistaken. If any man talked about
</p>
<p>his principles (as all men do and must at times),
</p>
<p>there was always at hand some dexterous pimp, whose
</p>
<p>business it was to ascertain their number. If they
</p>
<p>were found to be either more or less than seven, the
</p>
<p>discovery was fatal to his hopes of advancement.
</p>
<p>The character of Douglas Trevor had been formed
</p>
<p>under circumstances directly the reverse of those
</p>
<p>which had operated on his elder brother. He only
</p>
<p>remembered his father in the same circles and the
</p>
<p>same place in society in which his latter days had been
</p>
<p>spent. No change of condition had led me youth to
</p>
<p>turn his back on the companions of his boyhood ; no
</p>
<p>rapid promotion had filled him with a fond conceit

<p>of his own consequence, or an overweening eagerness
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>327
</p>
<p>for rank and emolument ; and his unbought fidelity
</p>
<p>had shown that he was of the number of those on
</p>
<p>whom rewards would be wasted. Thus it happened
</p>
<p>(as it often does), that two young men, sons of the
</p>
<p>same parents, educated in the same school, and trained
</p>
<p>to the same profession, were just the reverse of each
</p>
<p>other, in particulars wherein nature had probably
</p>
<p>made little difference between them. So it was, that
</p>
<p>while the one was indifferent to duty, frivolous, self-
</p>
<p>indulgent, and mercenary, the other was assiduous,
</p>
<p>discreet, temperate, and disinterested.
</p>
<p>It may be inferred from what I have said, that the
</p>
<p>rank of Col. Trevor was already above his merit.
</p>
<p>The consequence was, that having reached his present
</p>
<p>elevation by the force of causes not within himself,
</p>
<p>his own consciousness afforded no standard for his
</p>
<p>farther pretensions. He could see no reason why he
</p>
<p>should not be a field-marshal as well as a colonel.
</p>
<p>And so it was; for he had no just claims to either
</p>
<p>rank on the score of service or qualification. A stone
</p>
<p>thrown up, were it endued with consciousness and
</p>
<p>thought, could see no reason, as long as it was ascend
</p>
<p>ing, why it might not fly to the moon. If my expe
</p>
<p>rience in life has taught me anything, it is, that a man
</p>
<p>who sets no bounds to his aspirations, unless his daily
</p>
<p>intercourse with the world affords daily proofs of an
</p>
<p>intrinsic superiority over all he meets, is already
</p>
<p>raised above his merit.

<p>were busily engaged in their game, when the Orderly
</p>
<p>328 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>in waiting entered and announced an officer who
</p>
<p>wished to report himself to the commandant of the
</p>
<p>post.
</p>
<p>&quot;Let him call in the morning, and be damned to
</p>
<p>him,&quot; said Col. Trevor. &quot; Is this an hour to disturb
</p>
<p>a gentleman ? &quot;
</p>
<p>The Orderly saluted and withdrew, but presently
</p>
<p>returned to say that the officer had particular busi
</p>
<p>ness with Colonel Mason, and wished to see him
</p>
<p>immediately. Mason accordingly left the room, and
</p>
<p>was gone but a few minutes, when he too came back.
</p>
<p>&quot; This officer, sir,&quot; said he, &quot; asked to see me, sup
</p>
<p>posing me still in command here. His intelligence is
</p>
<p>for you ; and, from what I heard before I discovered
</p>
<p>his mistake, it may be important that you should
</p>
<p>receive it to-night.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well,&quot; said Trevor, in a tone at once lazy and
</p>
<p>peevish, &quot; I suppose I must see him. But it is
</p>
<p>damned hard that I cannot have a moment s leisure.
</p>
<p>Let him come in.&quot;
</p>
<p>He was summoned accordingly, and proved to be
</p>
<p>no other than our acquaintance, the Yankee spy,
</p>
<p>whom I now introduce to the reader, as he announced
</p>
<p>himself. He is Captain Amos Cottle, of the 20th regi
</p>
<p>ment of infantry, in the army of the United States.
</p>
<p>His name, I presume (like that of the fourteen James
</p>
<p>Thomsons, in Don Juan), had been bestowed in
</p>
<p>honor of the illustrious bard immortalized by Lord

<p>Byron. He was invited to take a glass of wine, and,

</p>
<p>having seated himself, requested a private conference
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 329
</p>
<p>with the commanding officer. This was a signal for
</p>
<p>the dispersion of the ladies, and their assiduous
</p>
<p>attendants, who adjourned to another room. Mason
</p>
<p>was about to follow, but the Colonel carelessly re
</p>
<p>quested him to remain.
</p>
<p>Captain Cottle was then invited to open his budget,
</p>
<p>which he did by telling what the reader already
</p>
<p>knows. Not a sentence did he utter, in which some
</p>
<p>indication of folly, vanity, or indiscretion did not
</p>
<p>escape him. All this, however, passed unremarked
</p>
<p>of Col. Trevor, whose eyes sparkled at the welcome
</p>
<p>intelligence. Nothing could be more apropos to his
</p>
<p>wishes, or to the plan of the President. &quot; Yeni, vidi,
</p>
<p>vici.&quot; The exploit of Caesar was the only parallel to
</p>
<p>that which he proposed to achieve. Occasionally he
</p>
<p>looked to Mason for sympathy and concurrence with
</p>
<p>his unexpressed thoughts. As often he withdrew his
</p>
<p>eye, chilled and perplexed by the cold, steady,
</p>
<p>thoughtful look of his companion. What could this
</p>
<p>mean ? Could Mason be insensible to the advantage
</p>
<p>of the plot, or indifferent to its issue ? Could envy
</p>
<p>so far prevail with a man heretofore distinguished by
</p>
<p>his disinterested zeal for the service, as to damp his
</p>
<p>ardor in an enterprise of so much promise ? He was
</p>
<p>at first indignant at this idea, but a little reflection
</p>
<p>made him judge his brother-officer with more candor.
</p>
<p>&quot; Poor Mason,&quot; said he to himself. &quot; I don t won
</p>
<p>der that he is a little mortified at my good fortune.

<p>post so long, without a chance to do anything, and
</p>
<p>33 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>that I should have come just in time to rob him of
</p>
<p>this. But then, damn it ! it is his own fault. What
</p>
<p>did he want with a reinforcement against a parcel of x
</p>
<p>ragged militia ? It was right to supersede an officer
</p>
<p>who would ask more than one regiment to meet any
</p>
<p>number of such ragamuffins that could come against
</p>
<p>him. Besides, he ought to have broken up their den
</p>
<p>long ago. If Douglas escapes me this time, it shall
</p>
<p>not be long before I smoke him out of his hole, or
</p>
<p>there is no virtue in gunpowder.&quot;
</p>
<p>Having thus reasoned himself into a state of exqui
</p>
<p>site self-complacency, he heard the story of Captain
</p>
<p>Cottle to the end, and then asked the opinion of
</p>
<p>Mason.
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot say,&quot; replied that gentleman, &quot; that I
</p>
<p>am prepared to give an opinion.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;I hope,&quot; said Trevor, &quot;that you don t mean to
</p>
<p>deny me the benefit of your thoughts.&quot;
</p>
<p>* So far from it, that I make it a point of conscience
</p>
<p>not to speak without having first thought. When I
</p>
<p>have done so, I will tell you what I think. To speak
</p>
<p>now would be but to give you the crude suggestions
</p>
<p>of unreflecting and impertinent presumption.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I cannot understand,&quot; said Trevor, &quot; how you
</p>
<p>can require time to think in so plain a case.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I might say, in reply,&quot; answered Mason, &quot; that
</p>
<p>as the case is so clear to you, you can hardly need my
</p>
<p>advice. Indeed, I understand your request of it, but
</p>
<p>as a compliment to which I am not insensible, and

<p>ppcak, therefore, I shall speak as plain as if the case

<p>were as full of difficulty to you as it is to me.&quot;
</p>
<p>Having said this, Mason drew Cottle into conversa

<p>tion ; inquired the particulars of his visit to the
</p>
<p>mountain ; encouraged him to recite his conversations
</p>
<p>with Douglas ; and, filling him full of vanity and con

<p>ceit by his deferential deportment, made the light
</p>
<p>shine through him, so as to expose his folly to the
</p>
<p>most careless observer. At length he was dismissed
</p>
<p>for the night, and Mason, addressing Trevor, said :
</p>
<p>&quot; I am now ready to give you my thoughts. I could
</p>
<p>not do so in Captain Cottle s presence ; and, indeed,
</p>
<p>my mind was not clear until I had some more conver
</p>
<p>sation with him. I am now satisfied.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Let s hear, then, the result of your cogitations,&quot;
</p>
<p>asked Trevor, with something of a sneer.
</p>
<p>Mason colored slightly, but said, in a calm tone:
</p>
<p>&quot; I have had some experience of this Captain Douglas,
</p>
<p>and am morally sure he has not been deceived by this
</p>
<p>man, as he supposes.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What ! &quot; exclaimed Trevor. &quot; Do you forget that
</p>
<p>Captain Cottle is an officer whose rank is a pledge for
</p>
<p>his honor, and who would forfeit his commission and
</p>
<p>his life by bringing false intelligence to his com
</p>
<p>mander ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t doubt his truth,&quot; said Mason, &quot; but his saga
</p>
<p>city I do doubt. The man is palpably a Yankee
</p>
<p>&quot; And the cunning of the Yankee is proverbial,&quot;
</p>
<p>interrupted Trevor.

<p>&quot; It is, indeed,&quot; replied Mason ; &quot; but as he is not

</p>
<p>only a Yankee, but obviously so, he could not
</p>
<p>have made Douglas believe that he was an influ
</p>
<p>ential inhabitant of Bedford, a native of the county,
</p>
<p>and a zealous stickler for the sovereignty of Vir
</p>
<p>ginia.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You give your Captain Douglas credit for a great
</p>
<p>deal of sagacity.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And not without reason,&quot; said Mason. &quot; His
</p>
<p>plans, and his manner of conducting them, all show
</p>
<p>it. His intelligence appears to be always correct and
</p>
<p>ready, and his devices for the concealment of his own
</p>
<p>schemes are commonly impenetrable. It is clear,
</p>
<p>from many circumstances, that he has agents who pass
</p>
<p>through the country unsuspected ; and I should not
</p>
<p>be surprised if Cottle had fallen in with one of them.
</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Douglas will be found at Jones s
</p>
<p>Ford on the day appointed ; but my life upon it,
</p>
<p>instead of coming there to be surprised, he proposes
</p>
<p>to come there to surprise you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Surprise ME ! &quot; said Trevor, scornfully.
</p>
<p>&quot; I have no apprehension that he will surprise
</p>
<p>you,&quot; said Mason, &quot;because I am sure you will take
</p>
<p>all proper precaution. I merely mean to say that he
</p>
<p>will attempt it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And be punished for his presumption,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Trevor. &quot; As to precaution, I must use it, to be
</p>
<p>sure, superfluous as it may be against a set of inex
</p>
<p>perienced militia.&quot;

<p>that not the least important, they have had more than
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 333
</p>
<p>we. They have tasted danger more than once ; and
</p>
<p>their skill in the use of the rifle is such as men who
</p>
<p>live with the weapon in their hands, and they alone,
</p>
<p>can be expected to acquire.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I hope to bring in some of them as prisoners,&quot;
</p>
<p>said Trevor, &quot; and then we shall see how that is. I
</p>
<p>will pit a dozen of our sharp-shooters against a dozen
</p>
<p>of them, my horse to yours.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am not in the habit of betting,&quot; replied Mason,
</p>
<p>smiling quietly; &quot; but, in this case, I dare say I may
</p>
<p>do it innocently, as the offence will hardly reach
</p>
<p>beyond intention ; so I take your bet.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; How do you mean? &quot; asked Trevor, sharply.
</p>
<p>&quot; I mean,&quot; said Mason, &quot; that I am not very sure
</p>
<p>that you will take a dozen of them.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Not sure! &quot; exclaimed Trevor ; &quot; how can they
</p>
<p>escape me ? &quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t profess to understand their craft,&quot; said
</p>
<p>Mason ; &quot; but they are hard to catch. In short,
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor, my instructions require me to afford
</p>
<p>you all the information I have acquired here. It is
</p>
<p>therefore my duty, even without question from you,
</p>
<p>to assure you that you are in the midst of a disaffected
</p>
<p>country, and that you are going against an enemy not
</p>
<p>to be despised, and among a people universally hos
</p>
<p>tile. Knowing these things, and invited by you to
</p>
<p>advise what is to be done in this affair, my advice is
</p>
<p>to march your whole disposable force to the appointed

<p>place, using every precaution to guard against sur

</p>
<p>far at leastas to underst and the ground, and to occupy
</p>
<p>it before the day.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And so he takes warning, and escapes me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; By no means. Cottle s scheme will have been
</p>
<p>made available so far as to draw him down from the
</p>
<p>mountains. You neither need nor desire any other
</p>
<p>advantage. But I see that I cannot easily make
</p>
<p>myself understood, because our minds are occupied
</p>
<p>with different things. You are thinking about the
</p>
<p>trap set for Douglas, and I am thinking about the
</p>
<p>snare he has laid for you. Depend upon it, Colonel
</p>
<p>Trevor, that the old story of catching a Tartar, may
</p>
<p>be illustrated by catching Douglas among the river
</p>
<p>hills. He may be caught ; and yet, neither come
</p>
<p>away, nor let you come. Observe,&quot; continued Ma
</p>
<p>son, &quot; when I inquired of this Captain Cottle about
</p>
<p>the nature of the ground at the Ford, behold, he had
</p>
<p>not taken notice of it ! but, on cross-examination, by
</p>
<p>finding what he did not see, I am satisfied that there
</p>
<p>is no low ground, nor cleared land at the place ; that
</p>
<p>the hills come sheer down to the river, and, by almost
</p>
<p>necessary consequence, that the road leads through a
</p>
<p>deep defile. The choice of such a place confirms my
</p>
<p>suspicion of Douglas s plan, and affords the means to
</p>
<p>counterwork it. If we occupy the strong points of
</p>
<p>the ground, and he comes with only such a body of
</p>
<p>men as Cottle expects, we take him without effusion
</p>
<p>of blood. If he comes in force, our position will give
</p>
<p>us all the advantage he seeks ; and, trust me, in that

<p>case we shall have need of them.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 335
</p>
<p>&quot; Need of advantages against irregulars!&quot; drawled
</p>
<p>Trevor, sneeringly, arid emphasizing every word.
</p>
<p>&quot; Our discipline and experience are of little conse
</p>
<p>quence,&quot; said Mason, &quot; if we do not use them. One
</p>
<p>use of them is to know how to take advantages.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Be it so,&quot; said Trevor ; &quot; I shall seek none. A
</p>
<p>fair field and a clear sky are all I ask ; and I shall be
</p>
<p>careful to take no measures which may alarm this
</p>
<p>mountain wolf, and drive him back to his den before
</p>
<p>I can come up with him.&quot;
</p>
<p>These words were hardly spoken when the Orderly
</p>
<p>announced that a sergeant of dragoons had just
</p>
<p>returned from a scouting party with important intel
</p>
<p>ligence, and had come to make his report to the Colo
</p>
<p>nel. &quot;What this was the reader will infer, when told
</p>
<p>that he was the non-commissioned officer on whom
</p>
<p>had devolved the command of the four men who had
</p>
<p>escaped with him from Jones s Ford. His informa
</p>
<p>tion confirmed Mason s suspicions, and might have
</p>
<p>served as a damper to the flattering anticipations of a
</p>
<p>man less sanguine than Colonel Trevor. Its only
</p>
<p>effect on him was to sharpen his eagerness for the
</p>
<p>expected rencontre. Yet the Sergeant, when ques
</p>
<p>tioned, frankly admitted that his party had not been
</p>
<p>out-numbered. But it was clear that their design
</p>
<p>had been, by some means, disclosed to Douglas ; and
</p>
<p>his advantage had been the result of judicious dispo
</p>
<p>sitions, and the skill of his men in the use of that
</p>
<p>most terrible of all weapons.

</p>
<p>contempt for a foe unskilled in the manual exercise,
</p>
<p>ignorant of the grand manoeuvres, and dressed in

<p>to bring him to listen to reason proved fruitless.

<p>Indeed the conversation occasionally took such a

<p>More dreadful far their ire
</p>
<p>Than theirs, who, scorning danger s name,
</p>
<p>In eager mood to battle came ;
</p>
<p>Their valor, like light straw on flame,
</p>
<p>A fierce, but fading fire !
</p>
<p>FREED at length from his troublesome adviser, Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor was left to the uninterrupted enjoyment of
</p>
<p>his anticipated triumph. He seemed to tread on
</p>
<p>air, and, with a flashing eye, and spread nostrils, to
</p>
<p>look forward to the glories, and snuff up the carnage
</p>
<p>of the expected fight. Such was his impatience for
</p>
<p>the adventure, that, in the eagerness of anticipation,
</p>
<p>he gave no thought to the necessary preparations.
</p>
<p>It was enough to issue the customary order for the
</p>
<p>troops to be in readiness for the march, with a sup
</p>
<p>ply of cartridges and rations suitable to the expedition.
</p>
<p>The third day of November at length arrived, and
</p>
<p>the troops took up the line of march. As they issued

<p>in glittering rank from the barracks above the town,
</p>
<p>the Colonel, proudly mounted on his stately charger,

<p>posted himself in the gateway of the house, where

<p>he had taken up his quarters, and received their

<p>passing salute. The portico of the house was crowded

<p>with female figures; the windows were clustered
</p>
<p>338 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>with fair faces ; the noble oak-trees in the yard were
</p>
<p>hung with garlands, in token of the loyalty of the
</p>
<p>household, and of an anticipated triumph in his
</p>
<p>assured victory. But the Colonel saw nothing of
</p>
<p>this. His eye saw not the waving of handkerchiefs,
</p>
<p>his ear heard not the cheering farewells issuing in
</p>
<p>tones of music from, rosy lips. He heard only the
</p>
<p>spirit-stirring drum and clanging bugle ; he saw
</p>
<p>nothing but the stately steppings of his well-trained
</p>
<p>troops as they marched by ; and then, his eye, fol
</p>
<p>lowing them, dwelt with delight upon their pictu
</p>
<p>resque appearance as they wound along the slope of
</p>
<p>the hill, and crossed Blackvvater-bridge. Beyond
</p>
<p>this, imagination presented objects of yet greater
</p>
<p>interest, the battle-field, the tumult of the strife,
</p>
<p>the rout, the pursuit, the carnage, the vanquished
</p>
<p>leader led in chains to the foot of the throne, the
</p>
<p>gracious smile of approving majesty, and the rich
</p>
<p>rewards of successful valor. These things he saw ;
</p>
<p>but saw not the gaunt figure of his host, who stood
</p>
<p>near, his strong features and manly person ill sort
</p>
<p>ing with the abject part he condemned himself to
</p>
<p>act. He sought in vain to catch the eye of the
</p>
<p>excited commander, desirous, in his parting words,
</p>
<p>to convey some expression of loyalty aid zeal.
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor marked him not; and, as the rear

<p>of the column was about to pass, put spurs to his

<p>horse, and galloped to the front.

<p>gence of the reader, while I introduce my humble
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 339
</p>
<p>self to his notice. A native of South Carolina, and
</p>
<p>the heir of a goodly inheritance, which, during a
</p>
<p>long minority, had been at nurse in the hands of an
</p>
<p>honest and prudent guardian, I was just of age, the
</p>
<p>master of a handsome income, and of a large sum of
</p>
<p>money in hand. Having a taste for military life, my
</p>
<p>guardian had procured me a situation in the military
</p>
<p>academy, which had been established by the State,
</p>
<p>as a counterpoise to that institution at which the
</p>
<p>Federal Government had taught so many of our
</p>
<p>southern youths to whet their swords against the
</p>
<p>only sovereignty to which they owed allegiance.
</p>
<p>My proficiency had been seen, and gave entire satis
</p>
<p>faction to my teachers. I had imbibed political
</p>
<p>opinions which made me a zealous advocate for the
</p>
<p>rights of the States, and a strenuous asserter of the
</p>
<p>unalienable independence of South Carolina. When,
</p>
<p>in compliance with the request of Mr. B , inquiry
</p>
<p>had been made for a young man qualified and dis
</p>
<p>posed to aid young Trevor in his enterprise, I had
</p>
<p>been selected for that purpose. I was invited to
</p>
<p>Columbia ; made acquainted with the plans of the
</p>
<p>insurgents in Virginia, and provided with letters to
</p>
<p>my future commander. Journeying to Virginia by
</p>
<p>the route that he had pursued, on the evening of the
</p>
<p>first day of November I entered the valley described
</p>
<p>in the first chapter. I soon encountered a crowd of
</p>
<p>men who filled the road and the yard of a house
</p>
<p>contiguous to it. There were wagons, horses, and

</p>
<p>arms; and the men, moving quietly but busily,
</p>
<p>340 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>seemed all earnestly engaged in some important
</p>
<p>preparation.
</p>
<p>I was presently stopped, courteously though pe
</p>
<p>remptorily ; and having expressed a wish to see Cap
</p>
<p>tain Douglas, was conducted to the house. There,
</p>
<p>pen in hand, and busily engaged in writing, sat a
</p>
<p>young man of small stature and slight figure. Though
</p>
<p>quite handsome, there was nothing remarkable in
</p>
<p>his features ; but a bright gray eye, of calm, thought
</p>
<p>ful, and searching expression, strongly contrasted
</p>
<p>with the dark brown curling hair that clustered over
</p>
<p>his brow.
</p>
<p>Being accosted by my conductor, he raised his
</p>
<p>head ; when I stepped forward, and handed him my
</p>
<p>letters. He glanced hastily to the signature of the
</p>
<p>first he opened, then read it leisurely, and looking at
</p>
<p>me with a beaming countenance, extended his hand.
</p>
<p>&quot;You are welcome, sir,&quot; said he; &quot;welcome to
</p>
<p>danger s hour. In the morning we march on an
</p>
<p>expedition which may decide the fate of the cam
</p>
<p>paign. My engagements must excuse my seeming
</p>
<p>neglect of you this evening. But let me make you
</p>
<p>known to your future comrades.&quot;
</p>
<p>Then turning to a fair-haired youth, already known
</p>
<p>to the reader as Arthur Trevor, he introduced him
</p>
<p>a? his mother s son. I was then made acquainted
</p>
<p>with Schwartz and Witt, and several others. Among
</p>
<p>the number were a few young men from the lower
</p>
<p>counties, of good families and education, who, in this

</p>
<p>crisis, had left their homes to engage in this expedi-
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 341
</p>
<p>tion. These, like their leader, had all learned to
</p>
<p>accommodate themselves to the fashions of that wild
</p>
<p>country, and its wilder climate, and especially to
</p>
<p>their own wild life. Each individual was dressed,
</p>
<p>from top to toe, in leather, no otherwise differing
</p>
<p>from the dress of the rudest mountaineer, than in
</p>
<p>neatness, and a certain easy grace, and air of fashion,
</p>
<p>which no dress can entirely conceal. In any dress,
</p>
<p>in any company, under any circumstances, Douglas
</p>
<p>Trevor would have been recognized as a gentle
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>I hardly remember how I fared, or how I passed
</p>
<p>the night. As a stranger, I presume somewhat better
</p>
<p>than most others ; but I took pains to show that I
</p>
<p>was content to eat what I could get, and to lodge as
</p>
<p>I might.
</p>
<p>At daylight we were on the road. But little
</p>
<p>attention was paid to order. ~No enemy was near,
</p>
<p>and nobody was inclined to desert. There w r as
</p>
<p>therefore no necessity for harassing men and
</p>
<p>horses, by forcing them to keep in ranks. Each man
</p>
<p>rode where, and with whom he pleased, except that
</p>
<p>a few were directed to keep near the wagons, not
</p>
<p>so much to guard as to assist in case of need. It is
</p>
<p>impossible to conceive a military array, with less of
</p>
<p>the &quot;pomp and circumstance of war.&quot; The horses
</p>
<p>were, for the most part, substantial, and in substan
</p>
<p>tial order. Their equipments were of the rudest sort.
</p>
<p>Plough-bridles and pack-saddles were most common.

</p>
<p>The only arms were the rifle, knife, and tomahawk,
</p>
<p>342 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>with their appropriate accompaniments of powder-
</p>
<p>horn, charger, and pouch. Douglas, indeed, had
</p>
<p>a sword, and the few sabres taken from the dragoons
</p>
<p>had been distributed among the principal men. But
</p>
<p>they were all too wise to encumber their persons
</p>
<p>with these weapons, which might have been trou
</p>
<p>blesome in their mode of warfare. A strong loop of
</p>
<p>thick leather, stitched to the skirt of the saddle, in
</p>
<p>front of the left knee, received the sword, the hilt of
</p>
<p>which stood up above the pummel. Two or three
</p>
<p>of the saddles were of the Spanish fashion, the horn
</p>
<p>of which served to support any trifle the rider might
</p>
<p>wish to hang on it. Douglas, in particular, carried,
</p>
<p>in this way, a leather case, containing his writing
</p>
<p>materials, and serving as a tablet for writing on
</p>
<p>horseback.
</p>
<p>But rude as these equipments were, yet to one
</p>
<p>acquainted with the object of the expedition, there
</p>
<p>was an appearance of efficiency in the whole which
</p>
<p>gave the corps a truly formidable aspect. The per
</p>
<p>fect order of the arms, the strong rude dress of the
</p>
<p>men, their sinewy frames, their sunburnt faces ; and,
</p>
<p>above all, the serious and resolved expression of
</p>
<p>countenance which generally prevailed, were tokens
</p>
<p>which none but a martinet would overlook.
</p>
<p>As yet no duty had been assigned to me, so that
</p>
<p>I was perfectly disengaged. It was not until we had
</p>
<p>ridden several miles, that Douglas found leisure to
</p>
<p>converse with me. He then joined me, accompanied

<p>by Schwartz, to whom, in my presence, he explained
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 343
</p>
<p>my situation. Schwartz heard him with thoughtful
</p>
<p>attention, and then said : &quot; It is all mighty well, sir,
</p>
<p>if Mr. Sidney will only just take it right. You see,
</p>
<p>sir,&quot; continued he, addressing me, &quot; there an t no
</p>
<p>officers among us, and we only just call the Cap
</p>
<p>tain so for short. If he was a Captain or a Gineral
</p>
<p>it would not make much odds, because these fellows
</p>
<p>just go for what is right and hard fighting ; and him
</p>
<p>they believe in, him they mind. But as to who is
</p>
<p>first and who is second, that s neither here nor there.
</p>
<p>I have not a doubt that you are the sort of a man we
</p>
<p>want ; but all that we can do, is to give you a fair
</p>
<p>chance to let the men see it. The Captain can be
</p>
<p>asking your advice, now and then, and I and Witt
</p>
<p>will do the same, and when they see that, they will
</p>
<p>begin to find out what you are. And then, you see,
</p>
<p>sir, when once we get to fighting, a man is never in
</p>
<p>such a flurry himself, but what he can see who
</p>
<p>knows what he is about, and who does not. So, by
</p>
<p>the time we have had a skrimmage or two, the men
</p>
<p>will know all about you ; and whenever the Captain
</p>
<p>is out of the way, they will all be looking to you to
</p>
<p>know what to do ; just in the way of giving your
</p>
<p>opinion, mind ; but, after a while it will get to be
</p>
<p>orders. And then, if any thing happens to the Cap
</p>
<p>tain, and Witt and I don t see cause to change our
</p>
<p>mind, why, we only just have to follow you, and the
</p>
<p>men they follow us, and all will go straight. So
</p>
<p>you must just make yourself easy and keep quiet.
</p>
<p>We ll tell you when to speak, and after a while

<p>you ll find yourself second in command before you

<p>know it.&quot;
</p>
<p>I had no difficulty in acknowledging the reasona
</p>
<p>bleness of these ideas, though it seemed a new thing
</p>
<p>to find a man possessing the influence and authority
</p>
<p>of Schwartz, devising means to transfer them to
</p>
<p>another. But he knew, and the event showed that
</p>
<p>he was right, that there were some duties of a com
</p>
<p>mander for which he was not fit ; and that there
</p>
<p>were other things to which a chief could not devote
</p>
<p>himself, for which he was better qualified than any
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>On the third of November we reached the ren
</p>
<p>dezvous, at the house of Mr. Gordon. On the way
</p>
<p>we had received frequent accessions of strength, and
</p>
<p>here we were joined by a yet larger reinforcement.
</p>
<p>Our whole number could not have been much, if at
</p>
<p>all, short of a thousand men.
</p>
<p>Meantime scouts came in, from whom we learned
</p>
<p>that the same day had been fixed for the march of
</p>
<p>the troops from Lynchburg. It followed that we
</p>
<p>had abundance of time for our preparations. It so
</p>
<p>happened, that they had not learned the name of
</p>
<p>the new commander ; but it was understood that a
</p>
<p>reinforcement had arrived, and that nearly the
</p>
<p>whole disposable force was on the march. This
</p>
<p>included a troop of dragoons and a company of
</p>
<p>artillery, with two pieces of cannon, in addition to a
</p>
<p>full regiment of infantry, and one battalion of

<p>another.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>. Having ascertained his force, and fixed on those
</p>
<p>on whom he could rely to understand and execute
</p>
<p>his plans, Douglas proceeded to make a temporary
</p>
<p>organization, suited to the occasion. The men were
</p>
<p>divided into corps, to each of which a post was pro
</p>
<p>visionally assigned, to be occupied as soon as the
</p>
<p>approach of the enemy should be announced.
</p>
<p>Across the road, near the head of the defile, and
</p>
<p>just above the first angle next the top of the ascent,
</p>
<p>was constructed a barricade of logs, similar to those
</p>
<p>already described. This reached, on each side, to
</p>
<p>the foot of the hills, at steep, rocky, and impracti
</p>
<p>cable points. It was long enough for twenty men to
</p>
<p>man its twenty loop-holes, and as it reached above
</p>
<p>their heads, they were quite concealed. An hun
</p>
<p>dred men were allotted to this post, who were ranged
</p>
<p>five deep behind the barricade, and instructed to fire
</p>
<p>in turn, each man falling back to the rear to reload
</p>
<p>as soon as he had discharged his piece.
</p>
<p>Others were distributed along the opposite faces
</p>
<p>of the hills overlooking the road, and directed to
</p>
<p>seek out hiding-places behind rocks, trees, and
</p>
<p>bushes. These men were under the immediate
</p>
<p>orders of individuals selected for the occasion, but
</p>
<p>attached to the command of Witt, who was stationed
</p>
<p>at the barrier.
</p>
<p>About a hundred were placed in ambush in the
</p>
<p>mouth of the ravine, just below the road, on the
</p>
<p>north side of the river, under Schwartz. These

<p>pose of attacking and carrying the guns of the
</p>
<p>enemy at the water s edge.
</p>
<p>Douglas himself, at the head of the rest of his
</p>
<p>corps, prepared to occupy the road on the north
</p>
<p>side of the river, to bring on the^ action. These
</p>
<p>were divided into two equal bodies, and the whole
</p>
<p>ranged in platoons, at open order, across the road.
</p>
<p>Of the two battalions, as they may be called, the
</p>
<p>foremost was placed under my command. The
</p>
<p>other Douglas commanded in person. My orders
</p>
<p>were to post my headmost platoon just at the bend
</p>
<p>of the road, on the top of the hill where it turns to
</p>
<p>the right. They were instructed to fire ad libitum,
</p>
<p>each man choosing and making sure of his mark,
</p>
<p>and then to file away by the right, and, taking to
</p>
<p>their heels, to run down to the river, cross it, and
</p>
<p>dispose themselves on the other bank, so as most
</p>
<p>effectually to gall the enemy, should he attempt to
</p>
<p>cross. Each platoon, in succession, was to march up
</p>
<p>to the same ground, and, having fired, to execute
</p>
<p>the same manoeuvre. The remaining column, under
</p>
<p>Douglas, were to stand their ground until the enemy
</p>
<p>should come in view on the top of the hill, and then
</p>
<p>to fall back fighting, and cross under cover of those
</p>
<p>who should have passed before. But the best

</p>
<p>CHAPTEE XXXYIII.
</p>
<p>The triumph and the vanity,
</p>
<p>The rapture of the strife ;
</p>
<p>The earthquake voice of victory,
</p>
<p>To thee the breath of life ;
</p>
<p>All quelled : Dark spirit, what must be
</p>
<p>The madness of thy memory ?
</p>
<p>WHILE these arrangements were in progress,
</p>
<p>scouts were hourly arriving. The country being
</p>
<p>altogether friendly, they were readily provided with
</p>
<p>fresh horses ; and, before the enemy were half way
</p>
<p>from Lynchburg, we were fully apprised of their
</p>
<p>number, equipments, and order of march. First
</p>
<p>came a squadron of dragoons ; then a light company ;
</p>
<p>then Trevor s regiment, about five hundred strong ;
</p>
<p>then a company of artillery ; then one battalion of
</p>
<p>Mason s regiment, consisting *f something more
</p>
<p>than two hundred men; the whole followed by a
</p>
<p>few light troops, by way of rear-guard. The whole
</p>
<p>might amount to a thousand men, well appointed
</p>
<p>and prepared at all points for efficient action.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the fifth of November, the
</p>
<p>men were ordered to betake themselves to their

</p>
<p>allotted posts; and Douglas, having visited each,
</p>
<p>348 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and seen that all was right, and rightly understood,
</p>
<p>addressed himself to his particular command. Wher*
</p>
<p>every man is an officer, each must be told indivi
</p>
<p>dually beforehand what is expected from him.
</p>
<p>Panic apart, they will be apt to fulfil such instruc
</p>
<p>tions, and will fight with the terrible efficiency of
</p>
<p>individual animosity. Hence the formidable cha
</p>
<p>racter of partisan warfare.
</p>
<p>At length the enemy made their appearance.
</p>
<p>Clinging to the idea of surprising Douglas, Col. Tre
</p>
<p>vor sent forward no advance, but determined to bring
</p>
<p>the whole strength of his corps to bear upon him at
</p>
<p>once. If he employed any scouts, they were either
</p>
<p>unfaithful, or were not permitted to approach near
</p>
<p>enough to learn any thing of the position or move
</p>
<p>ments of Douglas. The consequence was, that Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor received the first intimation of his presence
</p>
<p>from a sharp firing in front, which sent his horse to
</p>
<p>the right-about and back to the rear. Pressing for
</p>
<p>ward, he immediately ordered his sharp-shooters to
</p>
<p>disperse and take positions to gall us, while he pushed
</p>
<p>on his solid column of heavy infantry. The reception
</p>
<p>prepared for them was such as he had not dreamed of.
</p>
<p>His men fell like leaves in autumn ; and, as fast as
</p>
<p>one platoon of the mountaineers discharged their
</p>
<p>pieces, another was on the same ground to pour in
</p>
<p>again that terrible fire, of which the martinets of the
</p>
<p>regular service have so inadequate an idea. Instead
</p>
<p>of the deep-mouthed peal of muskets, discharged

</p>
<p>simultaneously, there is the sharp, short crack of rifle
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 349
</p>
<p>after rifle, fired by men no one of whom touches the
</p>
<p>trigger until he sees precisely where his ball is to go.
</p>
<p>The effect was suitable to the cause ; but yet the steady
</p>
<p>infantry pressed on,
</p>
<p>&quot; Each stepping where his comrade stood,&quot;
</p>
<p>to form an unbroken front, in order to charge with the
</p>
<p>bayonet.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the firing ceased, and, behold, their ene
</p>
<p>my seemed to have fled from the expected charge.
</p>
<p>The fact was, that my last platoon, having fired, had
</p>
<p>withdrawn like their predecessors, and were running
</p>
<p>at full speed after their companions, down the hill and
</p>
<p>across the river. At the water s edge, I stopped and
</p>
<p>joined Schwartz in his ambush. It had been arranged
</p>
<p>that I should do this ; because, in case we should be
</p>
<p>so fortunate as to seize the cannon, my skill as an
</p>
<p>artillerist might be of great use. Meantime, my men
</p>
<p>having crossed over, dispersed themselves along the
</p>
<p>bank, the face of the hills, and across the road, to
</p>
<p>cover the retreat of those who remained.
</p>
<p>The regulars had necessarily spent a few moments
</p>
<p>in repairing the wreck of their shattered column before
</p>
<p>they advanced. They then moved forward; but, before
</p>
<p>they turned the angle of the road, most of my men
</p>
<p>were across the river. At the same time, the column
</p>
<p>under the immediate command of Douglas was seen
</p>
<p>drawn up in the road, near the foot of the hill, with
</p>
<p>the rear resting on the water s edge. As the enemy

</p>
<p>advanced the front platoon fired, faced to the right,
</p>
<p>35 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>and filing along the flank of the column, entered the
</p>
<p>river and crossed just below the ford. They next
</p>
<p>filed to the left in the same way, and crossed above
</p>
<p>the ford. In this manner the whole column disap
</p>
<p>peared, one platoon after another, while their fire was
</p>
<p>answered by a roar of musketry, which, being dis
</p>
<p>charged from the higher ground, did more harm to
</p>
<p>those on the farther bank of the river than to -the
</p>
<p>nearer enemy. At length the last platoon was with
</p>
<p>drawn, and the regulars rushed down toward the river
</p>
<p>for the purpose of annoying them in crossing. In this
</p>
<p>attempt they were again checked and driven back by
</p>
<p>the terrible fire of my men, who, having already
</p>
<p>crossed, were drawn up, as I have said, on the other
</p>
<p>bank.
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor now saw the necessity of advancing his
</p>
<p>artillery, which was accordingly hurried down to the
</p>
<p>water s edge to clear a passage for the infantry. By
</p>
<p>the time the cannon were unlimbered, not a man of
</p>
<p>the mountaineers was to be seen. As soon as their
</p>
<p>companions had crossed, they dispersed with every
</p>
<p>appearance of confusion and alarm ; some scampering
</p>
<p>along the road, and some clambering up the hills on
</p>
<p>both sides of it.
</p>
<p>The way was now open, and the infantry advanced
</p>
<p>to cross the river. At this moment Colonel Mason,
</p>
<p>riding up to Colonel Trevor, pointed out the advantage
</p>
<p>ous position of the artillery as a cover to his rear, if
</p>
<p>he should be forced to retreat. &quot; Give me leave to

<p>suggest,&quot; said he, &quot; that it may be well to leave the
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 351
</p>
<p>cannon where they are. The cavalry, too, cannot act
</p>
<p>with effect among those hills, and the two together,
</p>
<p>should the fortune of the day be unpropitious, may
</p>
<p>be of more use here than on the other side.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You say true,&quot; said Trevor. &quot; It shall be as you
</p>
<p>advise, and you, Colonel, will remain in command of
</p>
<p>this reserve.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I earnestly beg, sir,&quot; said Mason, &quot; that you will
</p>
<p>not deny me a share in the work of the day. The
</p>
<p>Captains of artillery and dragoons are all-sufficient to
</p>
<p>the command of their respective corps.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, sir,&quot; said Trevor. &quot;None can be so
</p>
<p>proper to execute your prudent and cautious device
</p>
<p>as you, its author. You will be pleased, therefore, to
</p>
<p>repair to the rear, rally the dragoons, and bring them
</p>
<p>down to the water s edge. Let them be ready to cross
</p>
<p>at a moment s warning, to assist in the pursuit as soon
</p>
<p>as I have driven the enemy into the plain.&quot;
</p>
<p>Saying this, Colonel Trevor turned off, and giving
</p>
<p>the word to march, dashed into the river. Poor
</p>
<p>Mason, insulted and mortified, nevertheless patiently
</p>
<p>addressed himself to the duty assigned him. Thus
</p>
<p>was this able and brave man denied all participation
</p>
<p>in an affair which his arrogant and sanguine com
</p>
<p>mander believed to be an abounding source of honor
</p>
<p>to all who might be engaged in it.
</p>
<p>I have omitted to mention that, as soon as the
</p>
<p>plan of endeavoring to surprise the artillery had
</p>
<p>been adopted, Schwartz had requested me to draw

<p>the outline of a piece of mounted ordnance in the
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>sand, and to mark the proper positions of the artil
</p>
<p>lerists employed about it. While I did this, some
</p>
<p>ten or fifteen of our best marksmen stood by, looking
</p>
<p>on attentively. When my sketch was done, he
</p>
<p>turned to one of them, and pointing to one of the
</p>
<p>marks made to stand for an artillerist, said coolly :
</p>
<p>&quot; Now, this is your man ;&quot; and to another, &quot; this is
</p>
<p>yours.&quot; Thus he went on till he had doomed every
</p>
<p>victim.
</p>
<p>While we are supplying this omission in our nar
</p>
<p>rative, the reader will please to suppose that Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor s regiment have forded the river, and have
</p>
<p>passed up the road and out of sight. It will be
</p>
<p>remembered that the hills on both sides of the defile
</p>
<p>had been lined with concealed marksmen, and that
</p>
<p>the greater part of the advance had, on recrossing
</p>
<p>the river, thrown themselves into the same places of
</p>
<p>concealment. But the idea that they had done so
</p>
<p>for any purpose but that of safety, entered not into
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor s mind. Indeed, if he had had any
</p>
<p>doubt, it must have been removed when he found,
</p>
<p>that as his column wound through the deep defile,
</p>
<p>not a shot molested their march. At the first angle
</p>
<p>of the road he halted and let the column march past
</p>
<p>him. He could see, from this point, both the head
</p>
<p>of it, as it advanced, and the rear as it came up. As
</p>
<p>the latter passed the spot where he stood, the lead
</p>
<p>ing platoon was in the act of turning the next angle
</p>
<p>of the road. At that moment he heard the startling

<p>report of a volley of rifles. He set spurs to his horse
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 353
</p>
<p>to gallop to the front, when every rock and every
</p>
<p>tree of the surrounding hills burst into flame, and
</p>
<p>the deep ravine echoed to the report of a hundred
</p>
<p>rifles. A shot struck his horse, and another piercing
</p>
<p>his hat, grazed the top of his head deep enough to
</p>
<p>lay bare the skull, and stun him, as he fell under his
</p>
<p>slaughtered horse. He was thus placed hors du
</p>
<p>combat, owing the preservation of his life to the in
</p>
<p>signia of his rank which had endangered it.
</p>
<p>The sound of this firing was the signal for us.
</p>
<p>Each of the selected marksmen fixed his aim on his
</p>
<p>appropriate victim ; and, at a word from Schwartz,
</p>
<p>the artillerymen at the guns fell as if swept away
</p>
<p>by the breath of a tempest. Rushing from our hid
</p>
<p>ing-place, the cannon were instantly in our posses
</p>
<p>sion. The company of artillery were not slow to
</p>
<p>disappear behind the angle of the rock, and one or
</p>
<p>two who peeped out, being instantly picked off, we
</p>
<p>saw no more of them.
</p>
<p>Presently we heard the heavy tramp of the squa
</p>
<p>dron slowly descending the hill, accompanied with
</p>
<p>the peculiar sound of dragoons, dressing the front in
</p>
<p>preparation for a sudden and overwhelming charge.
</p>
<p>While this was passing, our guns were all reloaded.
</p>
<p>Mind, boys,&quot; said Schwartz ; &quot; all of number one.&quot;
</p>
<p>The word was understood, and every alternate man
</p>
<p>stood ready, with rifle cocked and trigger set, to
</p>
<p>receive the enemy. The charge was sounded, and
</p>
<p>the leading horsemen, wheeling around the rock,

</p>
<p>were rushing on at full speed, when horses and
</p>
<p>354 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>riders were seen to go down in one promiscuous
</p>
<p>heap. The greater number of the squadron were
</p>
<p>still out of sight ; and, had the way been open, might
</p>
<p>have followed to share the fate of their companions,
</p>
<p>and finally to ride us down when our guns should
</p>
<p>have been all discharged. But the work had been
</p>
<p>done too effectually. The dead and wounded (both

<p>obstacles in the face of fifty loaded rifles at a dis
</p>
<p>tance of twenty paces, was out of the question. A
</p>
<p>few who made the attempt found this to their cost.
</p>
<p>The charge was not renewed, and some of our men
</p>
<p>advancing to the angle of the rock, and occupying

</p>
<p>soon made them draw off to a safe distance.
</p>
<p>While this was doing, I, with the few men selected
</p>
<p>for the service of the artillery, gave my attention to
</p>
<p>that. Glancing my eye along both pieces, I saw
</p>
<p>that both had been accurately pointed into the road
</p>
<p>on the other side. I had nothing, therefore, to do
</p>
<p>but to apply the port-fire, which was still burning
</p>
<p>in the clenched hand of a dead artillerist. By this
</p>
<p>time the column had fallen back, and the road below
</p>
<p>the first angle was fast filling with the retreating
</p>
<p>mass. I had never before witnessed the effusion of
</p>
<p>blood ; and, heated as mine now was, it ran cold as
</p>
<p>[ applied the match. As the smoke cleared off, I
</p>
<p>saw the enemy throwing away their arms, and

<p>some aloft to the unseen foe that galled them from
</p>
<p>the hills. The fire instantly slackened, and cravats
</p>
<p>and handkerchiefs being raised on the points of
</p>
<p>swords and bayonets, it ceased altogether. The
</p>
<p>mountaineers now poured down from the hills into
</p>
<p>the ravine, securing the arms of the enemy, mixing
</p>
<p>among them and hemming them in on every side.
</p>
<p>Douglas, whose place, since he had recrossed the
</p>
<p>river, had been among these concealed marksmen,
</p>
<p>was one of the first to approach the enemy. Advanc
</p>
<p>ing to those whose rank was most conspicuous, he
</p>
<p>made known his authority, and received their swords.
</p>
<p>Meantime Col. Trevor had recovered his senses,
</p>
<p>and found himself fastened to the ground by the
</p>
<p>weight of his horse, which lay upon his leg. He
</p>
<p>was presently discovered, relieved, and helped to
</p>
<p>rise. At this moment he caught the eye of Douglas,
</p>
<p>who hastened to him, less from impatience to
</p>
<p>demand his sword, than to offer assistance to one
</p>
<p>who seemed to be an officer of high rank, and badly
</p>
<p>wounded. In the figure before him, all smeared
</p>
<p>with blood and dirt, he saw nothing by which lie
</p>
<p>could recognize his brother. To the Colonel, the
</p>
<p>disguise of Douglas was hardly less complete. He
</p>
<p>had seen him receiving the surrender of others, and
</p>
<p>stood prepared to go through the same humiliating
</p>
<p>ceremony. He felt that his own disgrace was com
</p>
<p>plete, and the form of surrender was thought of with
</p>
<p>indifference. He had already reached the lowest

</p>
<p>&quot; But in that lowest depth a lower deep&quot; seemed
</p>
<p>to open, when, as he extended his hand to deliver
</p>
<p>his sword to the victor, he discovered that the hand
</p>
<p>put forth to receive it was that of Douglas. He
</p>
<p>flung down his sword, stamping with rage, and im
</p>
<p>mediately after called to his men to resume their
</p>
<p>arms. The voice struck the ear of Douglas, though
</p>
<p>dissonant with passion. The figure too, confirmed
</p>
<p>his suspicion of the truth ; and he immediately
</p>
<p>rushed to screen his brother with his own body from
</p>
<p>the rifles pointed against him. Calling for aid to
</p>
<p>those around, he presently succeeded in securing the
</p>
<p>Colonel, and after one or two fruitless attempts to
</p>
<p>soothe him, ordered him away to the house of Mr.
</p>
<p>Gordon. To that gentleman he spoke aside, and
</p>
<p>explaining in confidence the strange scene that he
</p>
<p>had just witnessed, besought him to take command
</p>
<p>of the escort, and to pay all imaginable attention to
</p>
<p>the health, comfort, and feelings of the Colonel.
</p>
<p>He was accordingly led away, raging and foaming
</p>
<p>at the mouth like a spoiled child who has been
</p>
<p>deprived of his toy, or baulked in his amusement.
</p>
<p>The mortification of Douglas was extreme ; but he had
</p>
<p>the satisfaction to find that Arthur was not present;
</p>
<p>and to no other person but Schwartz and myself did

<p>rendering the last honors to their late commander.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>Having given the necessary orders, Douglas snatched
</p>
<p>a moment to ride to Mr. Gordon s, where he hoped to
</p>
<p>find his brother in a more reasonable mood. The
</p>
<p>Colonel had been confined in a private room ; and,
</p>
<p>being treated with great courtesy and respect, had lost
</p>
<p>nothing of his arrogance. Such is always the effect
</p>
<p>of delicate attention to the undeserving. A man of
</p>
<p>merit would have been softened and melted by the
</p>
<p>deference with which Colonel Trevor was treated. To
</p>
<p>him it seemed but that sort of spontaneous homage to
</p>
<p>greatness which the heart pays unconsciously. The
</p>
<p>effect of it was, that being told by Mr. Gordon that his
</p>
<p>brother had come to visit him in his room, he sent
</p>
<p>him the following magnanimous note, pencilled on the
</p>
<p>back of a letter :
</p>
<p>&quot; I am your prisoner. Do with me as you please.
</p>
<p>Inflict on me any death, however cruel ; but spare me
</p>
<p>the sight of one whose treasons have dishonored our
</p>
<p>common name, and who has deprived me of my only
</p>
<p>chance to restore its former splendor.&quot;
</p>
<p>Douglas was inexpressibly shocked at this manifes
</p>
<p>tation of a temper at once savage and coldly selfish.
</p>
<p>But he had no time to waste in parleying with the
</p>
<p>ungoverned passions of his brother, and wrote an
</p>
<p>answer in these words :
</p>
<p>&quot; You are my prisoner, and mine only, and shall be
</p>
<p>treated with all tenderness and respect. I am responsi
</p>
<p>ble to no one k&amp;gt;r your custody, and you shall soon be
</p>
<p>at liberty. Go home. Go to our venerable father,

</p>
<p>and comfort his declining years. If the instincts of
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 359
</p>
<p>your &quot;heart do not restrain you from fighting against
</p>
<p>your brothers (for Arthur is with me), let a sense of
</p>
<p>honor make you regard yourself as a prisoner on
</p>
<p>parole, not at liberty to fight again against Virginia.
</p>
<p>Meantime your sword shall be restored, and you shall
</p>
<p>be treated in all things as the brother of D. T.&quot;
</p>
<p>While Douglas was engaged in this painful duty,
</p>
<p>Arthur was employed in preparing a formal report of
</p>
<p>the events of the day. This was signed by the
</p>
<p>Chief on his return, and with it the young man was
</p>
<p>despatched to B , with instructions to ask his
</p>
<p>orders, and return with them, unless another messen
</p>
<p>ger should be preferred. In the meantime all things
</p>
<p>had been made ready for the march to Lynchburg. I
</p>
<p>shall not give the history of this. It was triumphal,
</p>
<p>as far as complete success and the applauding gratula-
</p>
<p>tions of the people could make it so. We had no
</p>
<p>difficulty in adding to our numbers as many men as
</p>
<p>the fruits of our victory enabled us to supply with
</p>
<p>arms. Some joined us instantly, and others engaged
</p>
<p>to rendezvous at Lynchburg in a few days.
</p>
<p>There was nothing to clamp the pleasure of Douglas,
</p>
<p>but the conduct of his perverse brother, and the pre
</p>
<p>sence of the dead body of his old friend, Colonel
</p>
<p>Mason. On our arrival before the camp at Lynch
</p>
<p>burg, I received orders to present myself with a flag
</p>
<p>before the gate, at the head of a detachment which
</p>
<p>escorted the body, accompanied by the music of
</p>
<p>his band, and all the sad and imposing insignia of a
</p>
<p>military funeral.

</p>
<p>360 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>An officer came out to meet us, and thus received
</p>
<p>the first authentic history of the fate of the expedi
</p>
<p>tion. I was instructed to deliver over the body of
</p>
<p>Colonel Mason with every circumstance of respect
</p>
<p>and courtesy. I was also charged to demand the sur
</p>
<p>render of the entrenched camp, and of the garrison as
</p>
<p>prisoners of war.
</p>
<p>A negotiation ensued, which ended in a suspension
</p>
<p>of arms for five days, and an agreement to surrender
</p>
<p>if, in that time, no reinforcement arrived.
</p>
<p>This arrangement was by no means unwelcome to
</p>
<p>Douglas. It gave him time to receive and organize
</p>
<p>the new recruits that were pouring in, and to await
</p>
<p>the return of Arthur. In the meantime, much of that
</p>
<p>sort of intercourse which is common on such occa
</p>
<p>sions took place. There are few things in life more
</p>
<p>pleasant than it is. There must be less of malignity
</p>
<p>in human nature than is generally supposed, or men
</p>
<p>would not seize, with so much eagerness, on oppor
</p>
<p>tunities to lose the idea of public hostility in the
</p>
<p>kindly interchange of courtesy and good offices.
</p>
<p>Friendships are never formed more suddenly and cor
</p>
<p>dially than under such circumstances. So we found
</p>
<p>it on this occasion. Major Wood, the officer in com
</p>
<p>mand, was a gentleman and soldier, honorable, frank,
</p>
<p>generous, and accomplished. I was brought much
</p>
<p>into contact with him, and found him enthusiastic in
</p>
<p>his acknowledgments of the merits of Douglas, and
</p>
<p>eager to become acquainted with him. But the time

</p>
<p>had not come when he was willing to be known by his
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 361
</p>
<p>true name ; and besides that he was acquainted with
</p>
<p>the Major, there were many others in the camp who
</p>
<p>would have recognized him. He therefore confined
</p>
<p>himself to his quarters, on various pleas of business ;
</p>
<p>and, to make his seclusion effectual, took lodgings in
</p>
<p>a house in the suburbs of the town. By his advice,
</p>
<p>I mixed much with the men ; and, as I had acquitted
</p>
<p>myself to their entire satisfaction in the late affair, I
</p>
<p>found that I was in a fair way to be recognized as
</p>
<p>second in command. Schwartz and Witt made a
</p>
<p>point of consulting me publicly on all occasions ; and
</p>
<p>this circumstance, together with my daily attention to
</p>
<p>the organization of the troops, obtained me full credit
</p>
<p>for all my military skill, and a great deal more.
</p>
<p>The five days passed away quite pleasantly. The
</p>
<p>regulars, finding that they were not like to fall into
</p>
<p>the hands of savages, were becoming reconciled to the
</p>
<p>fate which now seemed inevitable ; and we parted on
</p>
<p>the last night of the truce, with no unpleasant antici
</p>
<p>pations of the surrender which was to take place the
</p>
<p>next day at noon.
</p>
<p>The morning came, and our men paraded in high
</p>
<p>spirits, and with considerable show of order and disci
</p>
<p>pline. This was particularly the case with a small
</p>
<p>company which had been detailed for the service of
</p>
<p>the artillery, who took their stand at the guns with
</p>
<p>the air of men proud of their new acquirements. I
</p>
<p>had indeed taken great pains to train and exercise
</p>
<p>them, and, by universal consent, was recognized as

<p>the immediate commander of this corps, which was
</p>
<p>362 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>drawn up with the cannon planted directly against the
</p>
<p>gate of the camp.
</p>
<p>All this time Douglas did not make his appearance.
</p>
<p>At length the hour approached for the garrison to
</p>
<p>march out, and lay down their arms, when Schwartz
</p>
<p>went to his quarters to receive his orders. He soon
</p>
<p>returned, and taking me aside, told me that Douglas
</p>
<p>was not at his quarters, and was nowhere to be
</p>
<p>seen.
</p>
<p>We had already observed appearances in the camp
</p>
<p>not at all answerable to the expected surrender, and
</p>
<p>I was now startled at this intelligence. The character
</p>
<p>of Major Wood forbade indeed any suspicion of foul
</p>
<p>play. But the time was near at hand when the enemy
</p>
<p>should march out, and we heard nothing of their
</p>
<p>drums, calling the men to parade. We determined,
</p>
<p>therefore, to send a flag to the camp on some pretext.
</p>
<p>The officer who carried it was immediately warned
</p>
<p>off, and having said that he had a communication for
</p>
<p>Major Wood, was told that that officer was no longer
</p>
<p>in command, and that COL. TREVOR would receive no
</p>
<p>communication from rebels and traitors.
</p>
<p>This was decisive. The quarters of Douglas were
</p>
<p>not very distant from the enemy, and such had been
</p>
<p>the appearance of perfect good faith in all their pro
</p>
<p>ceedings, that our camp had been guarded even more
</p>
<p>negligently than is common with militia. It seemed,
</p>
<p>indeed, almost incredible that Col. Trevor could have
</p>
<p>been guilty of an act of base treachery against the

</p>
<p>life or liberty of his generous brother ; but to Schwartz
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 363
</p>
<p>and myself, who knew the connexion, even this seemed
</p>
<p>hardly less extravagant than his former conduct. That
</p>
<p>he had escaped, joined the troops, and disclaimed the
</p>
<p>capitulation entered into by Major Wood, was certain.
</p>
<p>To have surprised and carried off Douglas could not
</p>
<p>be much worse.
</p>
<p>We now consulted with Witt, to whom we commu
</p>
<p>nicated our suspicions, at the same time disclosing
</p>
<p>the true name of our young commander, and his rela
</p>
<p>tion to Col. Trevor. What was suspicion with us,
</p>
<p>was at once absolute certainty with him. I do not
</p>
<p>think I ever witnessed such a change as our communi
</p>
<p>cation made in the whole appearance and demeanor
</p>
<p>of the man. Heretofore, I had always seen him cool,
</p>
<p>cautious, deliberate, and thoughtful. There was,
</p>
<p>besides, a prevailing tone of benevolence in all he
</p>
<p>said, which, added to his sobriety and strong sense,
</p>
<p>gave him some claim to the title of philosopher. But
</p>
<p>now the expression of his countenance was terrible
</p>
<p>and awful. He had made no show of regard for
</p>
<p>Douglas ; but his attachment was deep and abiding,
</p>
<p>and his alarm for his safety was in the same degree.
</p>
<p>He was impatient of a moment s delay, sternly pro
</p>
<p>tested against wasting time in discussion, and insisted
</p>
<p>on immediately storming the camp.
</p>
<p>Schwartz was nothing behind him in zeal, though
</p>
<p>less disturbed by passion ; and we presently deter
</p>
<p>mined to bring matters to extremities. As soon,
</p>
<p>therefore, as the hour appointed for surrender arrived,

<p>our captive drummer was ordered to beat a parley.
</p>
<p>364 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>To this the only answer was a general fire of musketry
</p>
<p>from the whole line of the camp on that side, by which
</p>
<p>a few men were hurt. But the distance was too great
</p>
<p>for any serious mischief. Enough, however, was done
</p>
<p>to excite the men to fury ; and without waiting for
</p>
<p>the word, they rushed to the assault. Their move
</p>
<p>ment determined me. To rush up to the piqueted
</p>
<p>entrenchment, behind which the enemy were in com
</p>
<p>parative safety, was to expose themselves to destruc
</p>
<p>tion. It was indispensable to open a way for -them.
</p>
<p>This I effected by a discharge of both pieces of artil
</p>
<p>lery, which tore the gate away, and pointed their
</p>
<p>attack to this accessible point. The moment after,
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor, with his untractable rashness, appeared
</p>
<p>in the gateway, shouting, and calling to his men tc
</p>
<p>sally forth against us. He was instantly recognized
</p>
<p>by the incensed &quot;Witt, whose fatal aim brought him to
</p>
<p>the ground. His men fell back ; and in a moment
</p>
<p>after a white flag was raised.
</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to prevail on our men to
</p>
<p>pay any regard to this signal ; but we succeeded in
</p>
<p>restraining them before it was too late. Of course
</p>
<p>we demanded the instant surrender of the place,
</p>
<p>which was unhesitatingly given up. Major Wood
</p>
<p>now came forward to apologize and explain. Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor, having made his escape, had returned to the
</p>
<p>camp soon after tattoo. His whole behavior was
</p>
<p>that of a man beside himself, and actuated by some
</p>
<p>inscrutable motive to some inscrutable purpose. Of

</p>
<p>these he said nothing to his officers, but peremptorily
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 365
</p>
<p>disclaiming the capitulation, gave orders that all
</p>
<p>things should be prepared for a renewal of hostilities
</p>
<p>the next morning. Nothing more was known but
</p>
<p>that he had summoned to his quarters a favorite
</p>
<p>sergeant of his own regiment, who had been left
</p>
<p>sick in camp when he marched against Douglas.
</p>
<p>This sergeant and four soldiers, as it seemed from
</p>
<p>the morning report, had disappeared in the night.
</p>
<p>Major Wood assured us, that all that had been
</p>
<p>since done had taken place under *the immediate
</p>
<p>orders and superintendence of Colonel Trevor, and
</p>
<p>in spite of his own most earnest remonstrances. In
</p>
<p>proof of his sincerity, he appealed to the fact of his
</p>
<p>unconditional surrender the moment he was apprised
</p>
<p>of the fall of the Colonel. With all this I was per
</p>
<p>fectly satisfied, and gladly returned him his sword,
</p>
<p>with a proper acknowledgment of his gentlemanly
</p>
<p>conduct.
</p>
<p>&quot; And now, Major,&quot; said Schwartz, &quot;there is
</p>
<p>another matter we want to talk to you about. Do
</p>
<p>you know any thing of our Captain ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Of Captain Douglas ?&quot; said the Major. &quot; Cer
</p>
<p>tainly not. But I hope I may now have the pleasure
</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Major,&quot; said Witt, whose eye still
</p>
<p>glared with ferocity not at all abated by the fall of
</p>
<p>Trevor; &quot;that a nt the thing; and we want a
</p>
<p>straight answer. Captain Douglas is missing, and
</p>
<p>we want to know what s become of him.&quot;

</p>
<p>thing of him.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Is there any body here that knows, or is like to
</p>
<p>know ?&quot; said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; None that I can imagine,&quot; was the reply.
</p>
<p>&quot; Is there not a Captain here,&quot; asked Schwartz ;
</p>
<p>&quot; a red-headed fellow, that commands the company
</p>
<p>at Farmville ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Captain Cottle ? Yes.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Well, I want to see him.&quot;
</p>
<p>He was immediately summoned, and presently
</p>
<p>made his reluctant appearance. His alarm increased
</p>
<p>on seeing Schwartz and Witt.
</p>
<p>&quot;See here, Mister,&quot; said the former; &quot;bore is a
</p>
<p>piece of villany that we want to know about ; and
</p>
<p>there is nobody, I reckon, so apt to tell us as
</p>
<p>you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, sir,&quot; said Cottle, &quot;I declare, sir, I don t
</p>
<p>know a word about it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;You don t, eh!&quot; said Schwartz. &quot;Well, any
</p>
<p>how, you are mighty quick to find out that you don t
</p>
<p>know ; that I must say for you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Did } T ou ever see me before ?&quot; said Witt, fixing
</p>
<p>his terrible eye on the alarmed Captain. &quot; Did you
</p>
<p>ever see me before ?&quot; repeated he. &quot; Do you remem
</p>
<p>ber where it was ? Do you remember your busine&
</p>
<p>there ; and did you ever hear of such a thing as a

<p>man being hung for a spy ?&quot;

<p>these dreadful words. His face, already pale, became
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 367
</p>
<p>livid ; his eye no longer blenched under the fearful
</p>
<p>glance of Witt ; but the lids opened as if by mutual
</p>
<p>repulsion, while his lip and under jaw fell power
</p>
<p>less. He was roused from this state by Schwartz,
</p>
<p>who asked him what had become of Captain Doug
</p>
<p>las.
</p>
<p>lie was now effectually scared out of all thought
</p>
<p>of concealment, and answered without prevarication
</p>
<p>that Captain Douglas had been surprised, during the
</p>
<p>night, by the order of Col. Trevor, and sent away
</p>
<p>immediately under the guard of a sergeant and four
</p>
<p>men, across the river. He could not say, certainly,
</p>
<p>where he was gone ; but he suspected to Washington,
</p>
<p>as Col. Trevor appeared to have been writing busily
</p>
<p>all the time the party were engaged in the capture
</p>
<p>of Douglas. It was vain to attempt concealing that
</p>
<p>he had a hand in this, though the disclosure was
</p>
<p>made with great reluctance. It appeared, moreover,
</p>
<p>that he had been anxious to accompany the prisoner,
</p>
<p>supposing him to be ordered for Washington ; but
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor had refused to send him. Indeed, he
</p>
<p>sent none but those who had not been engaged in the
</p>
<p>action at the ford, and was certainly right not to trust
</p>
<p>the vain babbler, whose idle garrulity could hardly
</p>
<p>have failed to rub off any gloss he might have
</p>
<p>thought fit to spread over the affair.
</p>
<p>&quot; How did they get across the river ?&quot; asked
</p>
<p>Schwartz. &quot; We have a strong guard on the othe.
</p>
<p>side, and they had orders to keep a strict watch.&quot;
</p>
<p>Col. Trevor told the sergeant,&quot; replied Cottle,

<p>&quot;just to float quietly down the river and land away
</p>
<p>below; and a handkerchief was tied over the Cap
</p>
<p>tain s mouth to keep him from making a noise, and
</p>
<p>if he did, they were ordered to shoot him.&quot;
</p>
<p>I have no words to express the horror with which
</p>
<p>I heard this last circumstance. I trusted, and indeed
</p>
<p>Major Wood seemed to be of that opinion, that Col.
</p>
<p>Trevor had really been beside himself; but regarding
</p>
<p>his conduct even as the effect of frenzy, it was hardly
</p>
<p>less shocking. From Schwartz the communication
</p>
<p>only called forth some pithy expressions of detesta
</p>
<p>tion, without seeming to interrupt the working of his
</p>
<p>thoughts, which were at once busy to devise some
</p>
<p>remedy for the evil.
</p>
<p>Witt was differently affected. His whole frame
</p>
<p>and countenance assumed an appearance of stony
</p>
<p>rigidity, betokening fixed and fearful purpose. He
</p>
<p>turned his glaring eye to the spot where Col. Trevor
</p>
<p>had fallen, with an expression that showed his ven
</p>
<p>geance quite unsatisfied. A glance of fierce scorn
</p>
<p>fell for a moment on Cottle ; and then, with a search
</p>
<p>ing look, he addressed himself to Major Wood.
</p>
<p>&quot; Major Wood,&quot; said he, with a voice whose deep,
</p>
<p>stern tones, demanded the truth and the whole truth,
</p>
<p>&quot; did you know any thing of this business ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Upon my honor, I did not ; and Captain Cottle,
</p>
<p>who did know, will tell you so.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I would hardly take his word against himself&quot;

</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 369
</p>
<p>added, with the same look of severe scrutiny,
</p>
<p>u Major Wood, do yon know who Captain Douglas
</p>
<p>is? Do you know that he is Col. Trevor s own
</p>
<p>brother ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Great God !&quot; exclaimed the Major. &quot; Douglas
</p>
<p>Trevor ! That fine, intelligent, accomplished, noble
</p>
<p>young man !&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Did you know him ?&quot; asked the other.
</p>
<p>&quot; I did,&quot; said Wood, &quot; and loved him well. Poor
</p>
<p>fellow ! Poor fellow ! His doom is sealed.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That s enough,&quot; said Witt. &quot; I see now that yon
</p>
<p>had no hand in it. But is it not your duty, Major
</p>
<p>Wood, to bring back Captain Douglas and set him
</p>
<p>at liberty ?&quot;
</p>
<p>u Would to God that I could,&quot; said the Major ;
</p>
<p>&quot; but he is quite beyond my reach before this.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; See here, Major,&quot; said Schwartz ; &quot; write an
</p>
<p>order to that sergeant to bring him back, and give
</p>
<p>me a pass to follow him without being stopped, and
</p>
<p>I will have him back in no time. Them fellows lost
</p>
<p>ground here crossing the river, and I can catch
</p>
<p>them.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;That might do,&quot; said the Major, hesitatingly;
</p>
<p>&quot; and I am bound in honor to do it, because his cap
</p>
<p>ture was a breach of my truce. But I shall never
</p>
<p>be forgiven. No matter ; it shall be done if they
</p>
<p>break me for it.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You may thank the Major,&quot; said Witt, turning
</p>
<p>his implacable eye on Cottle, &quot; for that word ; for it

</p>
<p>370 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>you would have heen hanging like a dog in half an
</p>
<p>hour. Now, Major, I don t want you to come to any
</p>
<p>harm ; and so you shall have a fair excuse. Bring
</p>
<p>Captain Douglas back to us, and we will let this

<p>fellow go. But if the Captain is not here before the
</p>
<p>week is out, then, as sure as there is a God in Heaven,
</p>
<p>he shall be hanged for a spy, as he is.&quot;
</p>
<p>There is a difference between the certainty of being
</p>
<p>hanged in half an hour, and a chance of escape,
</p>
<p>however unpromising. To Captain Cottle, who had
</p>
<p>not ventured nearer to Jones s Ford than the rear of
</p>
<p>the dragoons, and who was now in greater peril than
</p>
<p>he had ever willingly encountered, the difference
</p>
<p>was of great importance. Yet his hopes were faint,
</p>
<p>for he had heard the orders of Trevor, which en
</p>
<p>joined despatch ; and he was equally earnest in
</p>
<p>hurrying the Major and Schwartz. His impertinence
</p>
<p>was cut short by ordering him to close custody in

<p>jail ; and the credentials of Schwartz being soon

<p>CHAPTEK XL.
</p>
<p>That lies like truth, and yet most truly lies.
</p>
<p>LET us again intrude into the sanctuary of majesty.
</p>
<p>The President is alone as before. He has the same
</p>
<p>air of somewhat impatient expectation. A shade of
</p>
<p>anxious thought is on his brow, and his cheek is
</p>
<p>flushed with some little excitement. Yet these ele
</p>
<p>ments are all so mixed as to be scarcely perceptible ;
</p>
<p>and were he conscious that we are looking at him,
</p>
<p>they would be completely concealed. On the table
</p>
<p>lie a number of letters recently received. Two of
</p>
<p>them are separated from the rest. He takes up one
</p>
<p>and reads it a second time. Let us look over him.
</p>
<p>It runs thus :
</p>
<p>&quot;The wisest may be deceived ; the most vigilant
</p>
<p>may be betrayed : for the MOST trusted are often the
</p>
<p>most treacherous. CAUTION.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; What means this ? ? said the President, musingly.
</p>
<p>&quot; Who is it that I am warned against ? The word
</p>
<p>i MOST is underscored. Who does that point at ?
</p>
<p>Whom do I trust most? I trust nobody. But I

<p>seem to trust ; and whom most f Surely it cannot

</p>
<p>interest. But may he not have an interest that I am
</p>
<p>not aware of? It must be considered.&quot;
</p>
<p>He then took up the other letter, which I beg
</p>
<p>leave to lay before the reader, as a specimen of the
</p>
<p>art with which the truth may be so told as to make
</p>
<p>others believe what is false. I recommend it par

<p>of a battle.
</p>
<p>HEAD QUARTERS, CAMP NEAR LYNCHBURG,
</p>
<p>November 12, 1849.
</p>
<p>Sm : I have the honor to lay before your Excel
</p>
<p>lency an account of the operations of the troops
</p>
<p>under my command, since the date of my last de
</p>
<p>spatch.
</p>
<p>In pursuance of the information I had received, of
</p>
<p>which your Excellency has been already advised, I
</p>
<p>marched on the third inst, at the head of my own
</p>
<p>regiment, one battalion of the 15th, a company of
</p>
<p>artillery, and one of dragoons, to meet Douglas on
</p>
<p>his descent from the mountains. At Jones s Ford,
</p>
<p>on Staunton river, I encountered him, when about
</p>
<p>half his force had crossed over. I attacked him
</p>
<p>immediately; and, after a sharp conflict, drove him
</p>
<p>across the river. By the advice of Col. Mason, I
</p>
<p>left the artillery and dragoons on the north bank, to
</p>
<p>protect our rear, placing them under the command
</p>
<p>of that distinguished officer.

<p>Pressing hard upon the rear of the enemy, we

</p>
<p>came up with him just as he had fallen back on the
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 373
</p>
<p>reserve. Here he rallied, and the fight was renewed.
</p>
<p>I regret to say that, at the first fire, my horse fell
</p>
<p>under me, imprisoning my leg by his fall. At the
</p>
<p>same moment a ball struck my head, and I came to
</p>
<p>the ground insensible.
</p>
<p>You will judge my astonishment, when, on reco
</p>
<p>vering my senses, I found that all my men near me
</p>
<p>had thrown down their arms, and that I was in the
</p>
<p>hands of the enemy, who assisted me to rise. I
</p>
<p>immediately called to my men to resume their arms ;
</p>
<p>but am sorry to inform you that I was not obeyed.
</p>
<p>As I had not surrendered, I was seized and hurried
</p>
<p>away to the house of a ring-leader of these rebels,
</p>
<p>where I was confined. From that time I had no
</p>
<p>means of receiving any information on which I could
</p>
<p>rely concerning the events of the day, as I had no
</p>
<p>intercourse with any but the rebels.
</p>
<p>Two days ago I was so fortunate as to make my
</p>
<p>escape. Returning to this place, I find my camp,
</p>
<p>which had been left under the command of Major
</p>
<p>&quot;Wood, beleaguered by the rebels, and a treaty for sur
</p>
<p>render in fiill progress. I rejoice that I have returned
</p>
<p>in time to prevent a consummation so disgraceful.
</p>
<p>It is now midnight, and a small party has been
</p>
<p>sent out to endeavor to surprise the leader of this
</p>
<p>banditti. In the meantime all things are put in
</p>
<p>readiness for a sortie in the morning. I shall not
</p>
<p>close my letter until I can give some further account
</p>
<p>of the success of these operations.

</p>
<p>the last man in the world whom I could have wished

<p>well deserved his grateful devotion. I speak of that

<p>my own weakness, by sending him on immediately

<p>sortie in the morning. He therefore travels in cus

<p>loss, or that of the enemy. I have nothing authentic

<p>failure of my enterprise to the unfortunate wound

<p>which put me hors du combat, at a moment, up to

<p>which we had successfully driven the enemy before

<p>OWEN TREVOK, Col. 18th Inf.
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; A worthy gentleman,&quot; said the President, fold
</p>
<p>ing up the letter. &quot; A most worthy gentleman ! Let
</p>
<p>any man doubt henceforth, if he can, that the only
</p>
<p>way to judge in advance of what a man will do, is to
</p>
<p>ascertain his interest. See how readily it settled this
</p>
<p>nice point of casuistry this delicate question of con
</p>
<p>flicting duties. Trust ! Yes, I will trust ; but not as
</p>
<p>fools do. I will trust no man s honor, but-every man s
</p>
<p>interest. The experience of my whole life has taught
</p>
<p>the lesson, and every day confirms it. Here comes
</p>
<p>a new example,&quot; added he, as the door-bell sounded,
</p>
<p>and was echoed by the single stroke in the room.
</p>
<p>The door opened, and the honorable Mr. Baker ap
</p>
<p>peared. His figure had lost nothing of its deferential
</p>
<p>bend ; his step nothing of its creeping, cautious
</p>
<p>tread ; his countenance nothing of its abject servility.
</p>
<p>But there was more of anxiety and less of hope,
</p>
<p>with a slight appearance of peevish dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>&quot;You are very good, my dear sir,&quot; said the
</p>
<p>President. &quot; You are always almost present to my
</p>
<p>wish. Government would be an easy task, were
</p>
<p>all officers like you.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I humbly thank your Excellency,&quot; replied the
</p>
<p>Judge. &quot; Were not your approbation precious to
</p>
<p>me, I might be tempted perhaps to look more than
</p>
<p>I ought to public opinion. Perhaps I do so, as it is;
</p>
<p>for though my duties are clearly necessary to the
</p>
<p>good of the State, I find it hard to bear the loud
</p>
<p>reproaches of a misjudging multitude, that reach me

</p>
<p>through a factious press.&quot;
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; Let it not reach yon, my dear sir. The storm
</p>
<p>does but rage without. Why need yon hear it when
</p>
<p>it touches yon not? Shut your ears and sleep
</p>
<p>soundly ; or open them only to the more pleasant
</p>
<p>tones that issue from loyal lips. I take care not to
</p>
<p>know what is said of me by malcontent scribblers ;
</p>
<p>but I hardly natter myself that I should preserve
</p>
<p>my equanimity, if I read all that is written.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;It is sometimes impossible not to hear,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the Judge ; &quot; and there are words which convey
</p>
<p>reproach, which, though uttered in a single breath,
</p>
<p>reach the heart. I can never, I fear, make myself
</p>
<p>proof against such a phrase as judicial murder.
</p>
<p>&quot; But you must find consolation in your own
</p>
<p>enlightened conscience, my dear sir. Some feeling
</p>
<p>must be expected when the edge of the law falls on
</p>
<p>victims whose offences demand punishment, and yet
</p>
<p>are such as those the world calls honorable and up
</p>
<p>right are most likely to commit.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; The misfortune is,&quot; replied the other, &quot; that it
</p>
<p>is only for such offences, and on such victims, that
</p>
<p>my office seems to- be made to act ; and when the
</p>
<p>curse rises up against me, loud as well as deep, and
</p>
<p>uttered and echoed on every side, I pray your Ex
</p>
<p>cellency to pardon me, when I say, that I find its
</p>
<p>honors and emoluments a poor compensation.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; It will be some relief to you, then,&quot; replied the
</p>
<p>President, &quot; that you are like to have a subject of a
</p>
<p>different sort to act upon. One whose crimes offend

</p>
<p>&quot; Of whom is your Excellency pleased to speak ?&quot;
</p>
<p>asked Mr. Baker.
</p>
<p>&quot; Of no other than that young fellow, Trevor,
</p>
<p>whose ill luck snatched him away from our hands,
</p>
<p>when perhaps he was not quite ripe for punishment.
</p>
<p>But he has since made himself perfect in crime, by
</p>
<p>becoming the leader of a desperate banditti. In
</p>
<p>short, he is no other than the famous Captain Doug
</p>
<p>las, and is now in my power. I think you will find
</p>
<p>in his case a fair set-off against some of the mortifi
</p>
<p>cations of which you complain ; and think no more
</p>
<p>of denying your services to the public, at least until
</p>
<p>he has fulfilled his destiny.&quot;
</p>
<p>The effect of this communication on the mind of
</p>
<p>the honorable gentleman, was such as the President
</p>
<p>had anticipated. To every being of the name of
</p>
<p>Trevor he bore a mortal antipathy. In the case of
</p>
<p>Douglas, this was rendered more intense by the sym
</p>
<p>pathy of a father with a favorite son. An envious
</p>
<p>malignity was a striking feature in the characters
</p>
<p>both of father and son ; and this had been provoked
</p>
<p>to the utmost by that unfortunate young man. Both
</p>
<p>were sensible that the younger Baker had been in
</p>
<p>bad odor with the public, ever since the affair at the
</p>
<p>falls ; and hence, it was not only grateful to their
</p>
<p>malice, but to their pride, to fasten on Douglas a

<p>stigma so dishonorable as to have relation back, and

</p>
<p>to excuse his adversary with those who did not
</p>
<p>know all the circumstances, for not seeking such
</p>
<p>redress as gentlemen demand of gentlemen only.
</p>
<p>The good humor of the Judge was now manifestly
</p>
<p>restored, and the President went on to give him some
</p>
<p>particulars of the late military occurrences. Douglas,
</p>
<p>he said, was on the road, and would reach Washing
</p>
<p>ton the next day. The letter, it seems, had been
</p>
<p>brought by a soldier who had orders to outgo the
</p>
<p>rest of the party, and ride express to Washington.
</p>
<p>&quot; It is well;&quot; said the President, &quot; that I have
</p>
<p>this timely intimation of his approach. The custody
</p>
<p>of State prisoners cannot be safely entrusted to any
</p>
<p>but the military ; and that of this young man must
</p>
<p>be committed to no corps in which he had any
</p>
<p>acquaintance. It seems that he was a universal
</p>
<p>favorite among men and officers. I am about to take
</p>
<p>measures to guard against any such blunder.&quot;
</p>
<p>In such conversation half an hour was passed, when
</p>
<p>the Minister made his appearance. He had been
</p>
<p>sent for, and to him the President communicated the
</p>
<p>history of the capture of Douglas. Had he turned
</p>
<p>an eye of close scrutiny on the favorite, at the mo
</p>
<p>ment when he uttered the name, and announced the
</p>
<p>fate of his victim, he might have seen a slight
</p>
<p>expression of countenance, which it would not have
</p>
<p>been easy to interpret. But this escaped him ; and
</p>
<p>he went on to direct that the true name of the pri-
</p>
<p>eoner should be kept secret ; that his arrival should

</p>
<p>be watched for ; and that he should be at once con-
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 379
</p>
<p>ducted to a place provided for the separate confine
</p>
<p>ment of State prisoners. It was, moreover, ordered,
</p>
<p>that a detail of officers and men for that prison should
</p>
<p>be carefully made, so as to exclude any persons
</p>
<p>whose loyalty was at all doubtful ; and especially all
</p>
<p>who, from former associations, could be supposed to
</p>
<p>feel any kindness for Douglas.
</p>
<p>Finally, it was agreed that, should he arrive in the
</p>
<p>course of that night, or the next day, he should be
</p>
<p>brought, on the following night, before the triumvi
</p>
<p>rate, in the room where they then were.
</p>
<p>&quot; You were right,&quot; continued the President, ad
</p>
<p>dressing his Minister, &quot; when you said that this
</p>
<p>young man had talent. The discovery of his identity
</p>
<p>explains the marvellous organization and efficiency
</p>
<p>of that wild banditti that he commanded. His
</p>
<p>capture must be fatal to their future success. They
</p>
<p>must be powerless now that they have lost their
</p>
<p>leader, and must soon disband. That is well. The
</p>
<p>two regiments may now be marched from Lynchburg
</p>
<p>to Richmond, and save us the necessity of sending a
</p>
<p>reinforcement from this quarter. The troops there,
</p>
<p>with this aid, will certainly be sufficient to check the
</p>
<p>insurrectionary movements that we hear of in the
</p>
<p>southern counties, and to cover the meeting of the
</p>
<p>Legislature. Col. Trevor has certainly deserved well.
</p>
<p>I am afraid his unfortunate wound may have occa
</p>
<p>sioned the loss of more men than we could well

<p>spare, who seem to have surrendered while he w r as

<p>380 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>will, of course, set them at liberty to return to their

<p>merit. He must be brevetted. As to Major Wood,
</p>
<p>in the regular course he should succeed Mason ; but

<p>I must hear more of this negotiation for a surrender

<p>of his post, before he is promoted. That affair must

<p>be satisfactorily explained, or he will hardly escape

<p>Treason can never take a form so hideous,

<p>But it will find a glass, that shall reflect

<p>A comely semblance, on which self may look

<p>With a complacent smile.
</p>
<p>ON his departure from Lynchburg, Schwartz had
</p>
<p>been provided with a suit of clothes half military, to
</p>
<p>prevent the notice which his rude mountain attire
</p>
<p>would have attracted. The day was half spent be
</p>
<p>fore he was on the road, and the sergeant and his
</p>
<p>party were already far in advance of him.
</p>
<p>Colonel Trevor had been desirous, for obvious
</p>
<p>reasons, that his letter and prisoner should reach
</p>
<p>Washington as soon as possible, and had ordered
</p>
<p>the party to proceed with all practicable despatch.
</p>
<p>But, as they might be somewhat retarded by the
</p>
<p>necessary care of their prisoner, he had directed that
</p>
<p>the letter should be sent on, as we have seen, by a
</p>
<p>single soldier, who had reached Washington on the
</p>
<p>second night. But the sergeant was not far behind,
</p>
<p>and had used such diligence that he crossed the
</p>
<p>bridge the next morning at an early hour, just as
</p>
<p>poor Schwartz came in sight.

</p>
<p>He recognized the party by the peculiar dress of
</p>
<p>382 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>Douglas, with which he was so familiar ; but it was
</p>
<p>too late. He followed, however, disconcerted by his
</p>
<p>failure, but not desponding. At the farther end of
</p>
<p>the bridge he was struck with the countenance and
</p>
<p>manner of a fine-looking young man, of genteel but
</p>
<p>plain appearance, who stood gazing earnestly after
</p>
<p>the prisoner and his guard.
</p>
<p>Observing Schwartz, he asked eagerly who the
</p>
<p>prisoner was, and was told it was Captain Douglas.
</p>
<p>&quot; Good God !&quot; exclaimed he, in a tone of deep
</p>
<p>concern ; u is it possible? But thank God! it is HO
</p>
<p>worse.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Did you think it was any body you knew ?&quot;
</p>
<p>asked the quick-witted Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; Yes,&quot; replied the other. &quot; I was almost sure it
</p>
<p>was a friend of my own.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; And what was your friend s name, stranger ? if
</p>
<p>I may be so bold.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You are bold enough,&quot; said the youth. &quot; I am
</p>
<p>not in the habit of answering questions, unless I
</p>
<p>know who asks them, and why.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I don t mean no harm, young man,&quot; replied
</p>
<p>Schwartz ; &quot; and if you tell me your friend s name
</p>
<p>and your own too, may be you won t be sorry for it.&quot;
</p>
<p>The stranger looked hard at Schwartz, and in his
</p>
<p>serious, earnest, and sagacious countenance saw
</p>
<p>enough to make him curious to know what this
</p>
<p>meant. He therefore replied, that his friend was

</p>
<p>&quot;Then I have a notion,&quot; replied Schwartz, &quot;that
</p>
<p>your name is Whiting.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; My name is Whiting,&quot; replied the other, in grea*
</p>
<p>surprise ; &quot; but how should you know it ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I have heard the Captain talk about you man^
</p>
<p>a time.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; The Captain ! What Captain ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Him&quot; replied Schwartz, pointing toward the
</p>
<p>distant party.
</p>
<p>&quot;Him! And how was he to know any thing
</p>
<p>about me ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Just because he is the very man you thought he
</p>
<p>was.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Douglas !&quot; exclaimed Whiting. &quot; Trevor !
</p>
<p>Douglas Trevor! Good God, what an ass I have
</p>
<p>been ! O Trevor, my friend ! how earnestly have I
</p>
<p>wished to know where to find you ! Had I been
</p>
<p>with you, this might have been prevented.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;May be it is best as it is,&quot; said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>&quot; The Captain did not want for friends where he
</p>
<p>was. May be one friend here will do him more good
</p>
<p>than a hundred any where else. That is what I am
</p>
<p>here for now.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;You are a friend to Trevor, then,&quot; replied Whit
</p>
<p>ing; &quot; perhaps one of his followers.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You may say that,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot; Any

<p>how, I m his friend.&quot;

<p>done. Trevor has friends enough here. Thank
</p>
<p>384 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>God ! I saw him. But for that we might not have
</p>
<p>found out who he was till it was too late.&quot;
</p>
<p>Whiting now showed Schwartz where to bestow
</p>
<p>his horse, and afterwards conducted him to his lodg
</p>
<p>ings. These were in an obscure suburb, humble,
</p>
<p>plain, and poorly fitted up. Appearances showed
</p>
<p>that the occupant spent most of his time with the
</p>
<p>pen, although many of the relics of his former mili
</p>
<p>tary equipments were to be seen about the room.
</p>
<p>But the dust on his cap, which hung against the
</p>
<p>wall, and the mould on the belt and scabbard of his
</p>
<p>sword, showed that these had been long unused. In
</p>
<p>truth, the escape of Douglas and his uncle had been
</p>
<p>fatal to him as a soldier. He had been dismissed
</p>
<p>the army ; and now, as it seemed, earned a poor
</p>
<p>livelihood by doing for small wages the manual
</p>
<p>labor of those offices, the salaries of which are
</p>
<p>received by men who do nothing at all.
</p>
<p>During their long w r alk through the streets of that
</p>
<p>city &quot; so magnificent in distances,&quot; as Monsieur
</p>
<p>Serrurier said of it, and while a hasty breakfast was
</p>
<p>preparing for Schwartz, he gave Whiting the parti
</p>
<p>culars of the late battle at Jones s Ford ; of Douglas s
</p>
<p>capture, and of his brother s death, and the surren
</p>
<p>der of the camp. As soon as he had seen, his guest
</p>
<p>provided for, the young man left him alone. Going
</p>
<p>out, he proceeded to the first stand of coaches, and
</p>
<p>stepping into one was driven to the Minister s.
</p>
<p>Here he alighted, showed a ticket to the porter,

<p>entered, threaded several passages, descended a dark
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 385
</p>
<p>stair, and, going into a small room in the basement,
</p>
<p>touched the spring of a bell. No answering sound
</p>
<p>was heard ; but in half an hour the Minister ap
</p>
<p>peared.
</p>
<p>&quot; I am glad to see you,&quot; said he. &quot; Have you
</p>
<p>heard that your friend Trevor is in the power of his
</p>
<p>enemies, and is expected here to-day?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I had not heard it,&quot; said &quot;Whiting ; &quot; but I have
</p>
<p>seen him. He is here.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Indeed ! That is well. We have the more time.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Where will he be lodged, and under what cus
</p>
<p>tody?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; In the state prison. I am instructed to select
</p>
<p>his guards from among those who are strangers to
</p>
<p>his person, and well-affected to the Government.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That will be no easy task, as it seems that all
</p>
<p>the troops of that description have been marched
</p>
<p>into Virginia, and that, except raw recruits, there
</p>
<p>are none here that it was thought safe to trust on
</p>
<p>that service.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; That is true,&quot; said the Minister ; &quot; and therefore
</p>
<p>I must select those same raw recruits. Think you
</p>
<p>there are many here who could be relied on to peril
</p>
<p>every thing on behalf of your friend ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; No doubt of it. I was long enough in the army
</p>
<p>after his disgrace to know that his whole regiment
</p>
<p>were indignant at it. A hundred can be found
</p>
<p>ready to wipe it out with the blood of the President,
</p>
<p>or their own.&quot;

</p>
<p>night, under the cloud of darkness. Have all things
</p>
<p>in readiness, and watch for his return. You will
</p>
<p>know what to do. Did you know those who had
</p>
<p>him in custody ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I knew the sergeant, and he knew me.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; All right. You then must be charged with the
</p>
<p>disappearance of Douglas ; you must therefore make
</p>
<p>your escape with him. I shall, of course, see you
</p>
<p>no more. We have no time for compliment ; but
</p>
<p>you will have my best wishes ; and the time may
</p>
<p>come when you may have it in your power to do me
</p>
<p>justice. My country is to me, Mr. Whiting, what
</p>
<p>yours is to you. When New England was permitted
</p>
<p>to join in what you will call the plunder of the
</p>
<p>South, I was not very scrupulous about the means of
</p>
<p>securing her share. But nearly all that was worth
</p>
<p>having is irretrievably lost. What remains can only
</p>
<p>be retained by means which will but make it an
</p>
<p>instrument of power in the hands of this man, and so
</p>
<p>enable him to perpetuate his reign according to the
</p>
<p>forms of the constitution. Take that away, and leave
</p>
<p>the matter altogether to the votes of the northern
</p>
<p>States, and I shall not long have to play second to
</p>
<p>him. In order to preserve his power, he would be
</p>
<p>compelled to break up the system of monopoly con
</p>
<p>trived for the exclusive benefit of his favorite Empire
</p>
<p>State ; or perhaps to concur with me in severing a
</p>
<p>Union, the benefits of which are now lost, by the

<p>escape of our common prey, and of which we bear

<p>all the inconveniences. Of course, I do not pretend
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 38,
</p>
<p>that the place to which the favor of my countrymen
</p>
<p>may advance me in either event, has no charms for
</p>
<p>me. But you will see that I am actuated by no low
</p>
<p>and sordid ambition. I am desirous you should see
</p>
<p>it in this light. It is not my fortune to command
</p>
<p>the services of many whose esteem is eminently desi
</p>
<p>rable. I am, therefore, the more ambitious of yours.
</p>
<p>Should I succeed, my acts will vindicate my motives.
</p>
<p>Should I fail (and if Virginia disenthrals herself I
</p>
<p>shall not fail), you will do me this justice. What

<p>news have you of the movements of B ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; He is about to take up arms, with the probability
</p>
<p>of assembling a force which, with the concurrence
</p>
<p>of the corps of Douglas, will secure his object.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; But is not the band of Douglas dispersed ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; By no means ; but much increased. They have
</p>
<p>still their mountain leaders, and a young man from
</p>
<p>the South Carolina military school, who seems well
</p>
<p>qualified to act, for the time, as the locum tenens of
</p>
<p>the chief.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Then farewell, sir,&quot; said the Minister. &quot; You
</p>
<p>carry with you my good wishes for yourself and
</p>
<p>your cause, and I pray you to commend them to

<p>About the time that these gentlemen thus separated,
</p>
<p>the President was informed that a gentleman and lady
</p>
<p>craved the favor of a private audience. He directed
</p>
<p>that they should be shown into the room, the privacy
</p>
<p>of which we have so often violated, and soon after he

</p>
<p>entered it.
</p>
<p>388 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>A lady, whose figure and dress denoted youth, was
</p>
<p>seated on the sofa. She was in deep mourning, and
</p>
<p>a black veil completely hid her face. By her side sat
</p>
<p>a gentleman far advanced in life, and of a most vene
</p>
<p>rable aspect. His fair complexion had blanched by
</p>
<p>time into the cold dead whiteness of age. The color
</p>
<p>had, in like manner, faded from his pale blue eye ;
</p>
<p>and the quivering of his livid lip, and the trembling
</p>
<p>of his eyelids, betokened deep and anxious dis
</p>
<p>tress. His dress also was of black, mournfully
</p>
<p>contrasting with the almost unearthly whiteness of
</p>
<p>his face.
</p>
<p>At the entrance of the President both rose ; and
</p>
<p>the trembling and agitated old gentleman might be
</p>
<p>seen to give way for a moment, as if about to throw
</p>
<p>himself on his knees before &quot; the dreaded prince whose
</p>
<p>will was fate.&quot; But he recovered himself, and with
</p>
<p>an air of suppliant dignity, stood as erect as the weak
</p>
<p>ness and infirmity of age permitted. The President
</p>
<p>approached him with a look of perplexity and doubt ;
</p>
<p>and, gazing earnestly at him, said : &quot;I beg to know,
</p>
<p>sir, who it is. Bless me ! Mr. Trevor, is it possible
</p>
<p>that I see you here, at this moment ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; I am here, sir,&quot; replied the old gentleman, &quot; a
</p>
<p>broken-hearted, bereaved father, lamenting the loss of
</p>
<p>one son, and suppliant for the life of another; and this
</p>
<p>is my niece, who is come to join her prayers to mine,
</p>
<p>on behalf of her betrothed husband.&quot;
</p>

<p>maiden confusion of poor Delia, but not enough to
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 389
</p>
<p>prevent her from lifting a timid glance, in which there
</p>
<p>was as much of entreaty as her proud spirit could
</p>
<p>descend to. She met the eye of the President, as with
</p>
<p>an air of quick and eager surprise he turned toward**
</p>
<p>her ; and in his eye she read a meaning, which, in the
</p>
<p>moment, blasted her hopes, and confirmed her in all
</p>
<p>her detestation of the cold, selfish, and crafty politi
</p>
<p>cian, whom she now beheld for the first time. She
</p>
<p>saw, instantly, that she was the object of some subtle
</p>
<p>purpose ; and felt, that by putting herself in his
</p>
<p>power, she had but prepared for her husband a deeper
</p>
<p>distress than all the severities of the law could inflict.
</p>
<p>But she quailed not at the thought. Her proud and
</p>
<p>bold spirit came in aid of her weakness ; her pale
</p>
<p>cheek burnt with an indignant glow, and the tears were
</p>
<p>dissipated from her eyes in the bright and almost
</p>
<p>fierce glance that flashed from them. Even through
</p>
<p>her veil too much of this appeared to escape the notice
</p>
<p>of the President.
</p>
<p>He instantly turned away ; and, with an air and
</p>
<p>tone of the most candied courtesy, addressed Mr. Tre
</p>
<p>vor : &quot; You speak in riddles, my dear sir,&quot; said he ;
</p>
<p>&quot; I beg you to explain.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; My task is more painful than I had anticipated,&quot;
</p>
<p>said the poor old man. &quot;Have I, then, to be the
</p>
<p>herald of my poor Owen s death, and of the yet more
</p>
<p>disastrous fate of my other noble boy ?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Col. Trevor dead, sir !&quot; exclaimed the President,
</p>
<p>&quot; Impossible ! I have just received a letter from him,

<p>written on the 12th.&quot;
</p>
<p>390 The Partisan Leader.
</p>
<p>&quot; That day was the last of his life,&quot; said the afflicted
</p>
<p>father. &quot; He fell next morning. I received the news
</p>
<p>yesterday by the railroad ; and Toy travelling all night
</p>
<p>by the same conveyance, I am here to entreat that the
</p>
<p>axe may not glean what the sword has left me. My
</p>
<p>poor boy Douglas, I am told, is in your power, and
</p>
<p>perhaps here.
</p>
<p>&quot; I had heard of this ; but I assure you your son is
</p>
<p>not here. I will not deny that I expect him ; and
</p>
<p>regret that it is under circumstances which will not
</p>
<p>allow me the pleasure of extending to him the same
</p>
<p>courtesy I shall be happy to render to you. Compose
</p>
<p>yourself, my dear sir ; let me beg you and your niece
</p>
<p>to retire to rooms which are always read}^ to receive
</p>
<p>you where I am master ; and let me send for your
</p>
<p>baggage.&quot;
</p>
<p>Delia, who thought there was something of hesi
</p>
<p>tancy in her uncle s mind, instantly exclaimed : &quot; ISTo,
</p>
<p>my uncle ! No, my father ! The palace of a tyrant
</p>
<p>is a prison. There is no mercy here. No hope for
</p>
<p>my noble husband. Save yourself. Return home
</p>
<p>while you may, and leave me here to share his fate.
</p>
<p>Our friends may rescue us. They WILL avenge us.
</p>
<p>But in that cold eye there is no relenting.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; You are harsh, lady,&quot; said the President ; &quot; I
</p>
<p>will not add, unjust. I will prove that, by permitting
</p>
<p>your instant departure, without even inquiring where
</p>
<p>you lodge.&quot;
</p>
<p>He now bowed them out, and immediately summon

<p>ing a servant, said : &quot; Take the number of that coach,
</p>
<p>The Partisan Leader. 391
</p>
<p>and let the driver attend me this evening.&quot; Then, as
</p>
<p>the servant left the room, he went on: &quot;Why, this is
</p>
<p>better and better. I think I have holds enough now
</p>
<p>on Baker to bind him to his task, however his heart
</p>
<p>may yearn after his beggarly estate in Virginia. It
</p>
<p>seems, forsooth, that after all that has passed, his son
</p>
<p>yet has a hankering after this girl ; the only woman,
</p>
<p>as he says, that he ever truly loved. It may be but
</p>
<p>spite against his favored rival ; or it may be, in truth,
</p>
<p>that every thing that bears the shape of man is sus
</p>
<p>ceptible of love, or what passes for it. Be it so. He
</p>
<p>may be gratified; but his father shall fulfil conditions.&quot;
</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day the following letter
</p>
<p>was put into the hands of the President :
</p>
<p>&quot;Your captive has arrived. Beware how you
</p>
<p>remand him to his prison, when you dismiss him to
</p>
<p>night. Order him to be confined within the palace ;
</p>
<p>and when you give the order, mark well its effect on
</p>
<p>him you most trust. CAUTION.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot; Why, here is proof as well as accusation,&quot; said
</p>
<p>the President. &quot; Here is treason. How else is it known
</p>
<p>that Trevor was to be brought here to-night? I will
</p>
<p>improve this hint. A rescue is to be attempted I Is
</p>
<p>that it ? Then the guard will be attacked on their
</p>
<p>return without the prisoner. Woe to the traitor if it
</p>
<p>prove so !&quot;
