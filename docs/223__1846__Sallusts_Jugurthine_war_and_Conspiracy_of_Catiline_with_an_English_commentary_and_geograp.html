<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>In preparing a new edition of Sallust for the press,
</p>
<p>the editor has taken the greatest care to make such
</p>
<p>alterations and improvements, in the v/ork, as may
</p>
<p>render it a still more useful guide to the student than
</p>
<p>Its predecessors have proved. The principal changes
</p>
<p>will be found to consist in a more enlarged commentary
</p>
<p>on the Jugurthine war, in the placing of this production
</p>
<p>of Sallust's before the narrative of the conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Catiline, and in the two Indexes, the one Geographical,
</p>
<p>the other Historical^ which have been appended to the
</p>
<p>work. The enlargement of the notes on the Jugurthine
</p>
<p>war has been made at the request of several instructors,
</p>
<p>who thought that a more ample commentary on this
</p>
<p>part of the historian's labours was needed by their
</p>
<p>pupils. The change introduced into the body of the
</p>
<p>w^ork, by placing the narrative of the war with Jugurtha
</p>
<p>before the account of Catiline's conspiracy, cannot but

</p>
<p>acquaintance with Roman literature, or even with Ro-
</p>
<p>man history. The old arrangement violates the order
</p>
<p>of time, since the attempt of Catiline to overthrow the
</p>
<p>government of %is country v>^as subsequent to the war
</p>
<p>with Jugurtha by a period of nearly fifty years. The
</p>
<p>impression produced, therefore, on the mind of the
</p>
<p>student, from his being required to read the two works
</p>
<p>in an inverted order, must, of necessity, be a confused
</p>
<p>one. In the account of Catiline's conspiracy, for ex-
</p>
<p>ample, he will find frequent allusions to the calamitous
</p>
<p>consequences of Sylla's strife with Marius, and will see
</p>
<p>many of the profligate partisans of the former rallying
</p>
<p>around the standard of Catiline ; while, in the history
</p>
<p>of the Jugurthine war, if he be made to peruse it after
</p>
<p>the other, in the ordinary routine of school-reading, he
</p>
<p>will be introduced to the same Sylla, just entering on
</p>
<p>a public career, and standing high in the favour and
</p>
<p>confidence of Marius ! How, too, will he be able to
</p>
<p>appreciate, in their full force, the remarks of Sallust re-
</p>
<p>lative to the successive changes in the Roman form of
</p>
<p>government, and the alternate ascendency of the aristo-
</p>
<p>cratic and popular parties, if he be called upon to direct
</p>
<p>his attention to results before he is made acquainted
</p>
<p>with the causes that produced them ? The only argu
</p>
<p>ment adduced in favour of the old arrangement is, that
</p>
<p>Sallust composed the narrative of Catiline's conspiracy
</p>
<p>before that of the Jugurthine war, and that all the
</p>
<p>manuscripts, and nearly all the editions of the historian^

</p>
<p>follow this same order, and place the account of the
</p>
<p>consph^acy first. Such an argument, however, if it be
</p>
<p>really deserving of the name, must weigh but little
</p>
<p>when positive utility is placed in the opposite scale.
</p>
<p>The order, moreover, for which we contend, is no nov-
</p>
<p>elty on the continent of Europe, as may be seen from
</p>
<p>the works of the President De Brosses, the Abbe
</p>
<p>Cassagne, and M. Du Rozoir. The last mentioned
</p>
<p>editor, indeed, expresses his very great surprise that
</p>
<p>the arrangement in question has not by this time be
</p>
<p>come a general one.
</p>
<p>With regard to the Indexes that have been added to
</p>
<p>the work, it may be sufficient to remark, that the object,
</p>
<p>in preparing them, was to relieve the commentary from
</p>
<p>what might have proved too heavy a pressure of mate-
</p>
<p>rials, and have deterred from, rather than invited, a pe-
</p>
<p>rusal. The geographical and historical matter, with a
</p>
<p>very few slight exceptions, now stands by itself, and
</p>
<p>may be consulted with more convenience, and it is
</p>
<p>hoped, with more decided advantage.
</p>
<p>The biographical account of S alius t, and the sketch
</p>
<p>of his writings, which have been given in the previous
</p>
<p>editions under the ordinary form, now assume the char-
</p>
<p>acter of an imaginary conversation, a mode of impart-
</p>
<p>ing information which the editor has recently adopted
</p>
<p>in a course of College-Lectures on Ancient Literature,
</p>
<p>and which he has found to be extremely well calculated

</p>
<p>In conclusion, the editor feels, that it would be the
</p>
<p>worst species of affectation in him, were he to conceal
</p>
<p>the pleasure he has experienced, at the very favourable
</p>
<p>reception which has been given to the previous editions
</p>
<p>of this work. And he thinks he may be allowed to
</p>
<p>state, with pardonable pride, that tWo separate re-prints,
</p>
<p>by different editors, total strangers to himself, have also
</p>
<p>appeared in England, and that too without any effort

<p>LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SAL LUST.
</p>
<p>DK. BAKTOX-HENKY AELINGTOX.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well, Henr}\, how are you pleased with Oxlord !  I have
</p>
<p>met you several times since your arrival among us, but have never be-
</p>
<p>fore this had an opportunity of conversing with you, or of ascertaining
</p>
<p>how you liked your new residence.
</p>
<p>H. I am delighted with it, my dear Doctor, and feel like a new being
</p>
<p>amid these classic shades. With the means of improvement now fully
</p>
<p>under my own control, I am determined to make that use of my time,
</p>
<p>which shall lead in after life, with the divine blessing, to permanent and
</p>
<p>honourable distinction. My reading begins, in fact, to assume a new
</p>
<p>character, and my attention is more and more directed every day to
</p>
<p>works of solid utility. It is with this view, indeed, that I have sought
</p>
<p>you on the present occasion, as I have just entered on a course of Roman
</p>
<p>literature, and wish to consult you about the merits of a writer, in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to whom, I am, I confess, in a good deal of doubt  Imean the his-
</p>
<p>torian Sallust.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I can easily conceive, Henry, that an ardent admirer Hke
</p>
<p>yourself of the character and serA'ices of a Cicero, would be inclined to
</p>
<p>regard the cold applause, which Sallust bestows upon the saviour of his
</p>
<p>country, in the light of a defect, and even stain upon his escutcheon
</p>
<p>as an historian. Nor will I stand forth to defend him. Something,
</p>
<p>however, must be conceded to the rankling of private animosity, and
</p>
<p>something to disgust at the ill-disguised and inordinate vanity of the
</p>
<p>Roman consul. For, after all, Henry, what is history 1 A mere place
</p>
<p>of exhibition, where the spectators are too little acquainted with the
</p>
<p>hidden causes of what they behold, and the actors are too directly inter-
</p>
<p>ested in the result, to enable us to depend, with any degree of certainty,
</p>
<p>on the accounts of either the one or the other !
</p>
<p>H. Your remaik is a very just one, my dear Doctor, and ought to
</p>
<p>teach us the utter uncertaint)' of this species of knowledge, except
</p>
<p>where it bears the impress from on high. Hi^tory, in the former case,
</p>
<p>may be likened to the arid plains of Ecnnat, where the half-buried temple,

<p>dark and mysterious language ; while, in the latter, she stands like the
</p>
<p>pyramids of that same Eastern land, alone in the midst of ruins, resting
</p>
<p>securely on the rock of ages, and pointing upward to the skies.  Bat I
</p>
<p>am wandering from my subject. Would it be too great an encroachment
</p>
<p>on your valuable time, Doctor, were I to ask for a brief sketch of the life
</p>
<p>of the historian 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Not at all, Henry. I am perfectly at leisure, and will accede
</p>
<p>to your request with the utmost readiness. Should any thing, however,
</p>
<p>strike you in the course of my remarks, as being either at variance with
</p>
<p>your pre-conceived notions, or savouring too much of mere speculation,
</p>
<p>you will oblige me by a candid communication of your sentiments.
</p>
<p>H. There will be very little occasion for this, my dear Doctor, as I
</p>
<p>am a mere novice in matters of literary history, and am come prepared
</p>
<p>to listen rather than to oppose. I will avail myself, however, of your
</p>
<p>very kind offer, to ask an occasional question or two, should any thing
</p>
<p>appear to me either novel or obscure.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well then, to begin vvith the name itself, the German scholars^
</p>
<p>whose research nothing can escape, are divided in opinion as to the pro-
</p>
<p>priety of writing Sallustius or Salustius, and Crispus Sallustius or
</p>
<p>Sdllustius Crispus.^ I believe it will be found, upon an examination of
</p>
<p>authorities, that Sallustius is the more correct form, and Crispus Sal-
</p>
<p>lustius the more usual arrangement of the manuscripts. It would seem,
</p>
<p>however, that, in the golden age of Latin literature, it was customary to
</p>
<p>place the cognomen after the nomen, and in the silver age to reverse this
</p>
<p>order.2  But let us proceed to the historian himself. Sallust was born
</p>
<p>at Amitcrnum, a town of the Sabines, B. C. 86, or A. U. C. 668. He
</p>
<p>received his education at Rome, and, in his early youth, appears to have
</p>
<p>been desirous of devoting him.self to literary pursuits. 
</p>
<p>H Allow me to interrupt you, my dear Doctor, and to ask whether
</p>
<p>it be not a very remarkable circumstance, that so many of the Latin
</p>
<p>writers were natives, not of the capital, but of the provinces, of Italy ?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The most careless inquirer, Henry, into the literary history
</p>
<p>of Rome, cannot but be struck by the singular fact, that so many of the

<p>distinguished individuals who grace the literary annals of the empire-city,
</p>
<p>were oom, not in Rome itself, but either in foreign lands, or in the prov
</p>
<p>inces of the Italian peninsula. Had the queen of nations adhered in
</p>

<p>the privileges of citizenship, how few of the great names that now adorn
</p>
<p>the history of hex literature could have been claimed by her as her own.
</p>
<p>Livius Andronicus, for example, was a slave from Magna Graecia ;
</p>
<p>Ennius was a native of the sam,e quarter of Italy ; Naevius was a Cam-
</p>
<p>panian ; Plautus came from Umbria ; PacuTius was born at Brundisium,

<p>Terence at Carthage, Catullus at Verona, Cicero at Arpinum, Virgil at

</p>
<p>at Sulmo, Lucan in Spain, the elder Pliny at Verona, and Tacitus at the
</p>
<p>Umbrian city of Interamna.  You see then, Henry, that Rome may be
</p>
<p>said to have acquned her literary, as she did her martial, fame, by the
</p>
<p>exertions of her aUies, the provincials of Italy.
</p>
<p>H. Yes, Doctor, and it is only transferring to the operations of intel-

</p>
<p>Dr. B. Notwithstanding his early zeal for literary pursuits, our his-
</p>
<p>torian appears to have been soon involved in that striving after military
</p>
<p>or political distinction, which formed so conspicuous a feature of the age
</p>
<p>in which he lived. We find him, accordingly, at twenty-seven, filling
</p>
<p>the office of quaestor, which entitled him, of course, to a seat in the
</p>
<p>senate, and, about six years afterwards, elected to the important post of
</p>
<p>tribune of the commons. While discharging the duties of this magis-
</p>
<p>tracy, he attached himself to the risnig fortunes of Julius Caesar, and,
</p>
<p>during its continuance also, he conducted, along with one of his col-
</p>
<p>leagues, the prosecution against Milo for the murder of Clodius.  Thus
</p>
<p>far all seems to have gone well with Sallust. In the year of Rome, how-
</p>
<p>ever, 704, or 50 B. C, he was excluded from the senate, by the censors
</p>
<p>Appius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Piso, for an act of gross im-
</p>
<p>morality.2
</p>
<p>H. You surprise me, Dr. Barton.  Sallust, wnose writings breathe
</p>
<p>so lofty an air of rigid morality.  Sallust, the stern declaimer against

<p>undoubtedly that noisy species, which is so fond of descanting on the

<p>of their lives, irregular and licentious, and it may well be doubted, whether
</p>
<p>either of them carried into fair and successful operation the moral theories
</p>
<p>which they were so anxious to promulgate.  And yet, although Sallust
</p>
<p>was confessedly a man of loose and corrupt principles, it is far from
</p>
<p>being certain that he was the monster of iniquity which some have been
</p>
<p>pleased to represent him. In the case at present Under consideration, it
</p>
<p>is more than probable that he owed his exclusion from the senate to tha
</p>
<p>violence of the patrician party, to which he was warmly opposed. The
</p>
<p>female, whose name is connected with this disgraceful affair was Fausta,
</p>
<p>the daughter of Sylla, and wife of Milo, and the injured husband is said
</p>
<p>to have caused the offender to be scourged by his slaves. i Now, as
</p>
<p>Fausta was not more remarkable for her personal attractions than for
</p>
<p>utter want of character, it seems rather extraordinary that, at a time
</p>
<p>when the corruption of manners had almost reached its maximum, the
</p>
<p>intimacy of a Roman senator with so abandoned a female should be
</p>
<p>deemed worthy of so severe a punishment as expulsion from his order.
</p>
<p>I cannot but think, therefore, that Sallust was sacrificed to the party
</p>
<p>spirit which agitated, and in fact divided, the republic. The prosecution
</p>
<p>against Milo, as has already been remarked, took place the same year
</p>
<p>that Sallust was tribune of the commons ; and the latter, who was a de-
</p>
<p>voted partisan of Caesar, had found means to defeat the plans of Cicero
</p>
<p>and the republican party, and procure the condemnation of Milo. Now the
</p>
<p>censor Appius Pulcher was seeking, it appears, the friendship of Cicero,
</p>
<p>whose aid was necessary to his projects, and it would seem that, in order
</p>
<p>to propitiate the good will of the orator, and other individuals of the party
</p>
<p>of Pompey, he ventured upon a decisive step against Sallust, which he
</p>
<p>sought to hide beneath the specious pretext of a regard for public morals.3
</p>
<p>What think you of this theory, Henry Arlington 1
</p>
<p>H. I am strongly inclined to adopt it, my dear Doctor, since, admit-
</p>
<p>ting it to be true, we may, without regarding Sallust as at all more vir-
</p>
<p>tuous than the great body of his contemporaries, be enabled to shield
</p>
<p>him, by this means, from the virulent abuse of Pompey's freedman Lenaeus,
</p>
<p>whose work should rather be called a frantic satire than an historical
</p>
<p>document.3  But proceed, if you please, with the life of the Roman.

<p>a share eventually in the expedition to Africa, where the scattered rem-
</p>
<p>nants of Pompey's party had rallied under the banners of Scipio and
</p>
<p>Juba. When this region was sabdued, he was left by Caesar as praetor
</p>
<p>of Numidia ; and, about the same time, he married Terentia, the di-
</p>
<p>vorced wife of Cicero. 1
</p>
<p>H. Whsit a blessing it must have been, Dr. Barton, to have lived un-
</p>
<p>der so virtuous a governor.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. If Dio Cassius speak the truth, Henry, I would rather be ex-
</p>
<p>cused from being governed by such a praetor as Sallust. The liistorian
</p>
<p>gives a sorry picture of his administration in Africa, charging him with
</p>
<p>flagrant extortion, and with the open despoiling of his province. Caesar,
</p>
<p>he says, assigned this region unto him, " to govern it in appearance, but,
</p>
<p>to plunder it in reality," Adyo.i i-dv ao^ecr, epyy cl ayeiv T Koi (pepiv zntrpC'
</p>

</p>
<p>means backward in fulfilling Caesar's expectations ; for, to borrow another
</p>
<p>phrase from Dio, he did not put in practice what he wrote. :vk linnfiaaro

</p>
<p>lust from another charge, that I wish you would again become his advo-
</p>
<p>cate on the present occasion. Is there nothing that can be urged in hi^
</p>
<p>behalf]
</p>
<p>Dr. B. It would not require much skill, Henrr, to make out a very
</p>
<p>plausible case in favour of Sallust, and that too on grounds merely of a
</p>
<p>probable nature. For it is difficult to conceive, how such conduct, as is
</p>
<p>alleged against him, can be in any way reconciled with the principles
</p>
<p>professed by him in his writings, or how a man so deeply guilty, as his
</p>
<p>enemies made him to be, could have publicly affected such rigid morali
</p>
<p>ty, without outraging, in the most shameless manner, the feelings of all
</p>
<p>his contemporaries. We are tempted to believe, therefore, that Dio Cas-
</p>
<p>sius, and the writers who, after him, have repeated these discreditable
</p>
<p>^?tories, were led astray by the declamations of the numerous enemies of
</p>
<p>our historian. One of the later editors, indeed, of the works of Sallust,

<p>xiv I^IFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>H. I would like to decide, Doctor, in favour of Sallust, but I feel
</p>
<p>myself bound in candour to pronounce an opinion against him. Ths
</p>
<p>arguments, just adduced in his favom*, are, to say the best of them, more
</p>
<p>imposing than solid, and the h}-pothesis which you were kind enough to
</p>
<p>mention is too absurd to require a serious refutation.  But what was the
</p>
<p>fate of Sallust under this charge of extortion and spoliation!
</p>
<p>Dr. B. It was such as might have been expected in the peculiar
</p>
<p>complexion of the times. He was acquitted by Caesar, his all-pow-
</p>
<p>erful protectoi.  ^After the expiration of his government, Sallust re-
</p>
<p>nounced all public employments, and betook himself to a luxurious re-
</p>
<p>tirement, with his, as I fear you will term it, ill-gotten wealth. He
</p>
<p>chose for his favourite retreats, a villa at Tibur, which had belonged to
</p>
<p>Caesar, and a magniiicent palace, w^hich he built in the suburbs of Rome,
</p>
<p>surrounded by delightful pleasure-grounds, afterwards well known and
</p>
<p>celebrated by the name of the Gardens of Sallust. Possessed of every
</p>
<p>attraction, the Sallustian palace and gardens became, after the death
</p>
<p>of their original proprietor, the residence of successive emperors. Au-
</p>
<p>gustus chose them as the scene of his most sumptuous entertainments.
</p>
<p>The taste of Vespasian preferred them to the palace of the Caesars.
</p>
<p>Even the virtuous Nerva, and stem Aurelian, were so attracted by their
</p>
<p>beauty, that, while at Rome, they made them their constant abode, i  In
</p>
<p>these gardens, or in his villa at Tibur, Sallust passed the concluding years
</p>
<p>of his life, dividing his time between literary avocations and the society
</p>
<p>of his friends, among v/hom he numbered Lucullus, Messala, and Corne-
</p>
<p>lius Nepos.
</p>
<p>H. But, my dear Doctor, if such were Sallust's friends, and such his
</p>
<p>favourite studies, how is it possible that he could have indulged in that
</p>
<p>excessive libertinism w^hich has been so often imputed to him "l
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Your question, Henr}^, is very w^ell put, and certainly does not
</p>
<p>admit of an easy answ^er. I think it more than probable, therefore, that
</p>
<p>the historian has been here confounded with the dissolute individual of
</p>
<p>the same name w^hom Horace mentions in the first book of his satires.
</p>
<p>For my own part, I do not doubt, as I have already remarked, but tha*^

<p>sever believe him to have been, as he is sometimes depicted, an aban-
</p>

</p>
<p>appears to have emanated from political antagonists, and, of all things in
</p>
<p>this world, pohtical diatribes are assuredly the most pregnant with false-
</p>
<p>hood. Now SaUust, it seems, being the decided enemy of Pompey

<p>ijad said of that Roman, that he was a man '' oris proM, animo invere-
</p>
<p>cundo.''^ Lenaeus, the freedman of Pompey, to whom you alluded a
</p>
<p>short time ago, avenged his master by the most virulent abuse of his
</p>
<p>enemy, in a work w^hich would seem to have made a complete sacrifice
</p>
<p>of truth to invective. 1
</p>
<p>H. From what premises, Doctor, do you draw this latter inference,
</p>
<p>since the work itself has not come down to us '?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Why, Heuiy, w^e may fairly judge, I think, of the injustice
</p>
<p>wiuch he did to the life of the historian, from what he says of him as
</p>
<p>an author. He calls him, as w^e learn from Suetonius, " nebulonem
</p>
<p>vita scriptisque monstrosum ; praeterea priscorum Catonisque inerudi-
</p>
<p>tissimum furem."2 This is the language of one of your thorough-going
</p>
<p>political partisans, who has entrusted his reason as well as his principles to
</p>
<p>the safe-keeping of his leader.  I wish we had the life of Sallust written
</p>
<p>by Asconius Pedianus, in the age of Augustus ; it might have served
</p>
<p>as a corrective of the unfavourable impressions which have been pro-
</p>
<p>duced by this libel, for it deserves no better name, of the freedman of
</p>
<p>Pompey.
</p>
<p>H. Aye, Doctor, but what will you say to the declamation against
</p>
<p>Sallust which has actually reached our times, and that too from the
</p>
<p>pen of Cicero 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Cicero never wrote it, Henr}^ It appeared long after tho
</p>
<p>death of that orator, and is now generally assigned, by critics, to a rheto
</p>
<p>rician in the reign of Claudius, called Porcius Latro. It is in the style
</p>
<p>of what we may suppose Lenaeus's work to have been, a tissue of invent
</p>
<p>ed or exaggerated calumnies, altogether unworthy of grave credence. 3
</p>
<p>H. And yet, Doctor, I was told by Boydel, of Clirist-church, no longer
</p>
<p>ago than last evening, that Le Clerc, the Hebrew professor at Am-
</p>
<p>sterdam, and also Meisner of Prague, in their respective accounts of the
</p>
<p>life of Sallust, have adopted these very calumnies which you so openly
</p>
<p>condemn.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Boydel should have told you also, Henry, that Sallust's char-
</p>
<p>acter has received more justice in the prefatory memoir and notes of De
</p>
<p>Brosses,4 and from the researches of Wieland.5  But come, let us now

</p>
<p>tate in the art of historic composition, since that was in a very low
</p>
<p>state when Sallast began to write. He, therefore, naturally recurred to
</p>
<p>the productions of the Greek historians, and attempted to transplant into
</p>
<p>his own language the vigour and conciseness which characterise in so
</p>
<p>eminent a degree the style of Thucydides.i
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Very correctly remarked, my young friend, only you ought to
</p>
<p>have added, that the strict imitation, with which Sallust has followed
</p>
<p>his Grecian prototype, has gone far towards lessening the effect of his
</p>
<p>own original genius. Still we cannot but admire the wonderful success
</p>
<p>of the Roman writer, in imitating the vigour and conciseness of the
</p>
<p>Grecian historian, and infusing into his composition something of that
</p>
<p>dignified austerity which distinguishes the work of his great model.
</p>
<p>H. But, Doctor, you surely do not mean to be understood as affirm-
</p>
<p>ing, that Sallnst's shjle is an imitation of that of Thucydides 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The questioji does you credit, Henry. I mean, when I say
</p>
<p>that Sallust imitates *.he historian of the Peloponnesian war, an imita-
</p>
<p>tion of his genera] manner, his rapidity, his force, his power of com-
</p>
<p>pression, rather than of his language. Thucydides, for example, often
</p>
<p>employs long and involved periods, while Sallust is ever abrupt and sen-
</p>
<p>tentious, even to a fault.  Have you taken notice how often the latter
</p>
<p>rejects the copulative ]
</p>
<p>H. I have. Doctor, and I think it produces a monotonous effect, and
</p>
<p>a total want of that flow and variety which constitute the principal charm
</p>
<p>of the historic period.  I was walking yesterday, with a fellow-common-
</p>
<p>er of All-Souls, and, the conversation happening to turn upon Sallust,
</p>
<p>and the peculiarities of his style, we made up between us the following
</p>
<p>list of items, about which, my dear Doctor, although a little matter in it-
</p>
<p>self, I would like to have your opinion.  We noticed, in the first place,
</p>
<p>that, in the ablative absolute, he sometimes suppresses the noun ; as,
</p>
<p>proditis quos ducebat ;^ and the antecedent to the relative ; as, quam oh
</p>
<p>quae praedicabat.^ We observed also particular expressions frequently
</p>
<p>occurring ; as ex sententia, etiam turn, sine mora, &c. Then again, we
</p>
<p>found several instances, where two words nearly synonymous were em-
</p>
<p>ployed ; as, cams, acceptusque,  varius incertusque,  bonum atque hmi-

<p>estum,  rogat atque hortatur, &c. We remarked, also, the use of the

<p>infinitive for the gerund ; as gratificari for gratificandi,^  adgredi, for

<p>adgrediendi ;^ and the omission of the connectives et and que occurs

<p>saiivG sentence ; and, as for his archaisms, we voted the greater part of
</p>
<p>them to be decided specimens of the worst kind of affectation.  Well,
</p>
<p>Doctor, what do you think of our critique ?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I like it, Henry ; and think that you and your fellow-Oxonian
</p>
<p>have given a very fair sketch of the minor peculiarities of Sallust.
</p>
<p>Whether his archaisms, however, deserve the name of affectations is a
</p>
<p>point on which you will find many differing from you. My own opinion
</p>
<p>is wiih you and your friend. Sallust hitroduces into his history a num-
</p>
<p>ber of words almost considered in his time as obsolete, and which were
</p>
<p>selected from the works of the older authors of Rome, particularly Cato
</p>
<p>the censor ; and it is here that he laid himself open to attack from Pollio
</p>
<p>in his letters to Plancus. His style, on the whole, indicates too much
</p>
<p>study and careful pruning, and is deficient in gracefulness and ease. I
</p>
<p>would not advise you to make him your model.
</p>
<p>H. This reminds me, Doctor, of old Roger Ascham's work, *' The
</p>
<p>Schoolmaster," which I slightly examined the other day in the Bodleian,
</p>
<p>and where I fonnd the opinion of Sir John Cheke relative to the merits
</p>
<p>of Sallust's Latinity. Sir John said, " that he could not recommend Sal-
</p>
<p>lust as a good pattern of style for young men, because in his writings
</p>
<p>there was more art than nature, and more labour than art ; and in his
</p>
<p>labour, also, too much toil, as it were with an uncontented care to write
</p>
<p>better than he could."  But, Doctor, how stands Sallust, as regards the
</p>
<p>delineation of character 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Here his merits are undoubted. Five or six of the characters
</p>
<p>drawn by him have been regarded in all ages as master-pieces of their
</p>
<p>kind. I need hardly mention the portraits of Catiline, Jugurtha, and
</p>
<p>Marius, nor the celebrated parallel between Caesar and Cato. There
</p>
<p>is something in the latter which always reminds me of the well-known
</p>
<p>sketch of Chatham, the father of Pitt :  " The secretary stood alone,"
</p>
<p>&c. Cato and Chatham were congenial spirits, and a Pythagorean
</p>
<p>would cite them as an illustration of his doctrine of the metempsychosis.
</p>
<p>H. What think you, Doctor, of the specimens of eloquence that are
</p>
<p>afforded by the speeches of Sallust 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I think them admirable of their kind, Henry, and in excellent

<p>keeping with the characters to whom they are respectively assigned.

<p>TsTothing, for example, can be better adapted to the character of Caesar,

<p>as far as we have been made acquainted with it by contemporary testi-

<p>mony, than the cool, and argumentative, and specious harangue, in v/hich

<p>he seeks to rescue the conspirators from the fate which is so justly their

<p>due. In like manner, the bold and fervid language assigned to the Ro-

<p>while thr vvords of Marius are the effusions of a bhint and galla-nt soldier,
</p>
<p>who had as yet displayed no traces of the cold-blooded assassin, the
</p>
<p>tyrant, buffoon, and usurper.
</p>
<p>H. But is it possible. Dr. Barton, that Sallust can be correct, in
</p>
<p>making Caesar a sceptic with regard to the soul's immortality 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Aye, Henry, and worse than a sceptic, a downright unbeliever.
</p>
<p>The whole tenour of Caesar's life is in strict accordance with this. His
</p>
<p>secret disregard for all morality, his open contempt for all honourable
</p>
<p>principles, his cold and selfish and murderous ambition, as if the lives
</p>
<p>of his fellow-men were but the playthings of an hour  every thing, in
</p>
<p>short, in the character of this remarkable man, reveals to our view a
</p>
<p>bosom warmed by no spark of social feeling, but as dark and as silent as
</p>
<p>the grave. It was but natural, therefore, that such a mind should see,
</p>
<p>or rather wish to see, in the horizon of the future, nothing but the gloom
</p>
<p>of annihilation, and should regard the doctrine of a future state of exist-
</p>
<p>ence as a bubble and a dream. How different from all this is the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of our own philosopher, who had penetrated deeply into the mys-
</p>
<p>teries of nature, and yet, with humbied feelings, could stoop to kindle
</p>
<p>the torch of knowledge at the altars of his God. " I envy no quality
</p>
<p>of the mind," he remarks, " or of intellect in others, be it genius, power,
</p>
<p>wit, or fancy : but if I could choose what would be most delightful, and
</p>
<p>I believe most useful to me, I should prefer a firm religious belief to
</p>
<p>every other blessing ; for it makes life a discipline of goodness ; creates
</p>
<p>new hopes, when all earthly hopes vanish ; and throws over the decay,
</p>
<p>the destruction of existence, the most gorgeous of all lights ; aw^akens
</p>
<p>life even in death, and from corruption and decay calls up beauty and
</p>
<p>divinity ; makes an instrument of torture and shame the ladder of ascent
</p>
<p>to Paradise ; and, far above all combinations of earthly hopes, calls up
</p>
<p>the most dehghtful visions of palms and amaranths, the gardens of the
</p>
<p>blest, the security of everlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic
</p>
<p>view only gloom, decay, annihilation, and despair."
</p>
<p>H. Beautifully expressed, Dr. Barton, and as true as it is beautiful
</p>
<p>You are quoting, if I mistake not, Sir Humphrey Davy, the pride of
</p>
<p>English science. 1  How meanly, by the side of this, appear the atheisti-

<p>cal speculations of La Place, who could see in the wonders of the uni-
</p>
<p>verse no indications of the finger of a Deity.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Why, Henry, as for atheists, if such singular beings do in
</p>
<p>fact exist, there is one simple argument which they can never answ^er.
</p>
<p>Ere we can say that there is no God, we must have roamed over all
</p>
<p>nature, and seen that no mark of a divine footstep was there ; and w^e
</p>
<p>must have gotten intimacy with every existent spirit in the universe, and
</p>

</p>
<p>earned from each that never did a reyelation of the Deity visit him ;
</p>
<p>and we must have searched, not into the records of one solitary planet,
</p>
<p>but into the archives of all worlds, and thence gathered, that, throughout
</p>
<p>the wide realms of immensity, not one exhibition of a reigning and Uviiig
</p>
<p>God ever has been made. In other words, before man can deny the
</p>
<p>existence of God, he must be a God himself, for he must possess the
</p>
<p>ubiquity and omniscience of the Godhead.^  But let us return from our
</p>
<p>digression. TMiere were vre 1
</p>
<p>H. We were alluding to the skill which Sallust displays in adapting
</p>
<p>his speeches to different characters.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. "Well, then, we will now take up the consideration of his
</p>
<p>works.  The first production of Sallust was the " Conspiracy of Cati-
</p>
<p>line." He had attained the age of twenty- two years when the conspiracy
</p>
<p>broke out, and was an eye-witness of the whole proceedings. He had,
</p>
<p>therefore, every means in his power for giving an accurate history of this
</p>
<p>very remarkable event, nor has he neglected to employ them. In the
</p>
<p>detail of facts, he is entitled to our fullest confidence ; for, in every thing
</p>
<p>of importance, he coincides fully with Cicero, whose Catilinarian orations
</p>
<p>form, in fact, an excellent commentary on the w^ork of the historian.
</p>
<p>But Sallust lived too near the times which he describes to be an impar-
</p>
<p>tial writer. Private animosity and party feeUng warped his judgment ;
</p>
<p>and it is frequently but too apparent, that we are listening not to the
</p>
<p>philosophic historian, but to the political partisan. He is too favoiurable
</p>
<p>to Caesar ; he is unjust towards Cicero ; and, although fond of display-
</p>
<p>ing his skill in drawing characters, he exercises none of it on the Roman
</p>
<p>orator. But to this we have already alluded. As for the preface to the
</p>
<p>work, it is, like that to the Jugurthine War, rather a compliment paid by
</p>
<p>the author to his own character and pursuits, than a pertinent introduc-
</p>
<p>tion to an historical narrative.
</p>
<p>H. With regard, Doctor, to the subject of that narrative, do you not
</p>
<p>think the picture of the consphacy is somewhat overcharged, and that
</p>
<p>It was merely an effort, on the part of the lower orders, to break the
</p>
<p>chains imposed upon them by an odious and tyrannical aristocracy I
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Some persons, at the present day, are inclined to favour this

<p>opinion,2 Henry, but I am afraid they are guided, in forming it, rather too
</p>
<p>much by their own private feelings and the political aspect of their own
</p>
<p>times. They appear to forget altogether the character of the leader in
</p>
<p>this nefarious undertaking, and do not perceive that, if his immediate
</p>
<p>followers w-ere oppressed by any thing, it was by the heavy buiden of
</p>
<p>vheir own vices. But of all this we will talk at some other time,

<p>ZX I^IFE AND V/RITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>Let us proceed to the Jugurthine war. Althoiigh not an eye-witness
</p>
<p>of this contest, yet Sallust's situation, as governor of Numidia, which
</p>
<p>seems to have suggested the composition, was favourable to the author-
</p>
<p>ity of the work, as it afforded him the means of collecting materials
</p>
<p>and procuring information.
</p>
<p>H. Do you think. Doctor, that his residence in Africa was of any
</p>
<p>advantage to him as regarded a knowledge of its earlier history 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Of none whatever. His account of the first settling of Africa
</p>
<p>IS a mere fable, although he quotes in its behalf the Punic books of King
</p>
<p>Hiempsal, (referring probably to documents preserved in his archives,!)
</p>
<p>and the traditions of the inhabitants themselves. His geographical
</p>
<p>descriptions, however, if we except a few slight errors, are extremely
</p>
<p>valuable.  Bat to return to his account of the war. Sallust has been
</p>
<p>charged with partiality towards the character of Marius, and with giving,
</p>
<p>for the sake of his favourite leader, an unfair account of the massacre
</p>
<p>at Vaga. In this, however, I cannot concur ; and the best answer to
</p>
<p>the charge in question is the ample justice which he does to Metellus,
</p>
<p>in describing the war as almost brought to a close by him previous to
</p>
<p>the arrival of Marius. As a piece of composition, this narrative deserves
</p>
<p>to rank very highly, and the varying nature of the contest, the talents,
</p>
<p>the endless resources, the total want of principle, the sufferings of con-
</p>
<p>science, which are all found combined in the character of Jugurtha,
</p>
<p>stand forth in vivid and picturesque colours, and convey a mroral lesson
</p>
<p>not easy to be effaced. 2
</p>
<p>H. I have often dwelt upon that picture, Dr. Barton, and upon the
</p>
<p>miseries of suspicion and remorse which Jugurtha created for himself by
</p>
<p>his own atrocities ; and it has been often a question with me, whether
</p>
<p>he were not more wretched, on the throne, than in the dungeon where
</p>
<p>he terminated his miserable existence.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Let us pass now to the History of Sallust. This was a civil
</p>
<p>and military history of the republic, in five books, including a period,
</p>
<p>however, of only thirteen years^ from the resignation of the dictatorship
</p>
<p>by Sylla, till the promulgation of the Manilian law. The period thus
</p>
<p>embraced was a short but momentous one ; Mithridates, in the East

</p>
<p>displaying all the resources of his powerful genius against the Roman
</p>
<p>rule, and Sertorius, in the West, turning the arms of the republic against
</p>
<p>itself, while the bosom of Italy was the scene of a formidable commo-
</p>
<p>tion, excited by a host of gladiators and slaves. The work was intro-
</p>
<p>duced by two discourses, the one containing a delineation of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment of Rome, and the habits and manners of its people, from the

</p>
<p>earliest period to the commencement of the civil wars ; the other
</p>
<p>giving a general view of the dissensions between Sylla and Marius.i
</p>
<p>H. Why, Doctor, it must have connected the termination of the
</p>
<p>Jugmrthine war with the commencement of Catiline's conspiracy. What
</p>
<p>a pity it has not come down to us.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. And the more so, too, since all the accounts of Roman his-
</p>
<p>tory which have been -^Niitten are defective during the very period which
</p>
<p>it em.braced. Nearly seven hundred fragments, belonging to it, have
</p>
<p>been collected from scholiasts and grammarians, by the President de
</p>
<p>Brosses,2 but they are too short and unconnected to serve any valuable
</p>
<p>purpose. When I say this, however, I mean to be understood as ezcept-
</p>
<p>mg four orations and two letters, and a fragment giving a description
</p>
<p>of a splendid entertainment, v/ith which Metellus was honoured on his
</p>
<p>return, after a year's absence, to his government of Farther Spain. This
</p>
<p>work was the production of Sallust's matured intellect, and the last
</p>
<p>which he composed. It was inscribed to LucuUus, the son of the cele-
</p>
<p>brated commander.
</p>
<p>H. Are there not, Doctor, two political discourses, concerning the
</p>
<p>administration of the government, in the form of letters to Julius Caesar,
</p>
<p>which are supposed to have been the productions of Sallust 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. They are commonly thought to have been composed by him,
</p>
<p>but the grounds of this opinion are fax from satisfactory to one who
</p>
<p>examines the subject with any attenticn.s
</p>
<p>H. Many thanks to you, my dear Doctor, for your kindness in
</p>
<p>devoting f^ much of your valuable time to this notice of Sallust and
</p>
<p>his writings. "I hope I may be able to profit by them in the prosecution
</p>
<p>of my private studies, and that it will be allowed me occasionally to con-
</p>
<p>sult you on other points of classical biography.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. You will always find me ready, and willing, Hemy, to co-
</p>
<p>operate in so praiseworthy an undertaking. God bless you, my dear
</p>
<p>boy ; and may you become in after-life an honour to your friends and
</p>
<p>an ornament to our common country : for the truest definition of happi-
</p>
<p>ness is, a cultivated intellect in unison with a virtuous heart.  Farewell.

<p>Micipsae fuerant, metus invadit : in duas partis disce-
</p>
<p>dunt : plures Adherbalem sequuntur, sed ilium alterum
</p>
<p>bello meliores. Igitur Jugurtlia quam maxumas potest
</p>
<p>copias armat ; urbis ^partim vi, alias voluntate imperio
</p>
<p>suo adjungit ; omni Numidiae imperare parat, Adberbal,
</p>
<p>^tamen etsi Romam legatos miserat, qui senatum doce-
</p>
<p>rent de caede fratris et fortunis suis ; tamen, fretus mul-
</p>
<p>titudine militum, parabat armis contendere. Sed, ubi res
</p>
<p>ad certamen venit, victus ex praelio profugit in ^provin-
</p>
<p>ciam, ac deinde Romam contendit. Tum Jugurtlia, ^pa-
</p>
<p>tratis consiliis, in otio facinus suum cum animo reputans,
</p>
<p>timere populum Romanum, neque advorsus iram ejus
</p>
<p>usquam, nisi in avaritia nobiiitatis et pecunia sua, spem
</p>
<p>habere. Itaque paucis diebus cum auro et argento multo
</p>
<p>Romam mittit, ^quis praecepit, uti primum veteres amicos
</p>
<p>muneribus expleant ; deinde novos adquirant ; postremo,
</p>
<p>quemcumque possint largiundo parare, ne cunctentur.
</p>
<p>Sed, ubi Romam legati venere, et, ex praecepto regis,
</p>
<p>nospitibus, "^aliisque, quorum ea tempestate auctoritas pol
</p>
<p>lebat, magna munera misere ; tanta commutatio incessit,
</p>
<p>uti ex maxuma invidia in gratiam et favorem nobiiitatis
</p>
<p>Jugurtlia veniret ; quorum pars spe, alii praemio inducti,
</p>
<p>^singulos ex senatu ambiundo, nitebantur, ne gravius in
</p>
<p>eum consuleretur. Igitur, legati ubi satis confidunt, die

<p>dine in regnum suum ^convertit, existumans dolore per-

<p>hand longe a mari, prope Cirtam oppidum, utriusque
</p>
<p>consedit exercitas : et, quia die extremum erat, praeliam
</p>
<p>non inceptum. Ubi plerumque noctis processit, ^obscuro

<p>etiam turn lumine, milites Jugurthini, signo dato, castra

<p>liostium invadimt ; semisomnos partim, alios arma su-
</p>
<p>mentes fugant fundiintque ; Adherbal cum paucis equiti-
</p>
<p>bus Cirtam profugit, et, ni multitudo togatorum fuisset,
</p>
<p>quae Numidas insequentes moenibus prohibuit, uno die
</p>
<p>inter duos reges coeptum atque patratum bellum foret.
</p>
<p>Igitur Jugurtha oppidum circumsedit, ^vineis turribusque et

</p>
<p>festinans ^tempus legatorum antecapere, quos, ante prae-
</p>

<p>postquam senatus de bello eorum accepit, tres ado-

<p>eos ab armis discedere ; de controversiis suis jure potius,

<p>quam bello disceptare ; ita seque iliisque dignum fore."
</p>
<p>XXII. Legati in Africam maturantes veniunt, eo magis,
</p>
<p>quod Romae, dum proficisci parant, de praeiio facto et op-
</p>
<p>pugnatione Cirtae audiebatur : sed is rumor ^clemens erat.
</p>
<p>Quorum Jugurtlia accepta oratione respondit : " sibi

</p>

</p>
<p>fuit. " Non mea culpa saepe ad vos oratum mitto, Patres

<p>tiora fore. Quae postquam ex sententia instruit, ^intem-

<p>pesta nocte, de improviso multitudine Numidarum Auli

<p>cognitis militibus, quos, praeter fugam, soluto imperio,

<p>nihil sibi agitandum.
</p>
<p>XL. Interea Romae C. Mamilius Limetanus, tribunus
</p>
<p>plebis, ^rogationem ad populum promulgat, " uti quaere-
</p>
<p>retur in eos, quorum consilio Jugurtlia senati decreta

<p>annis Romae ortus, otio et abundantia earum rerum,

<p>quae prima mortales ducunt. Nam, ante Carthaginem
</p>
<p>deletam, populus et senatus Romanus placide modesteque
</p>
<p>inter se rempublicam tractabant : neque gloriae, neque
</p>
<p>dominationis certamen inter civis erat : metus hostilis in
</p>
<p>bonis artibus civitatem retinebat. Sed, ubi ilia formido
</p>
<p>mentibus discessit ; scilicet ea, quae secundae res amant,
</p>
<p>lascivia atque superbia incessere. Ita, quod in advorsis
</p>
<p>rebus optaverant, otium, postquam adepti sunt, ^asperius
</p>
<p>acerbiusque fuit. Namque coepere nobilitas ^dignitatem,
</p>
<p>populus libertatem in lubidinem vertere : sibi quisque '
</p>
<p>Mucere, trahere, rapere. Ita omnia in duas partis ab-
</p>
<p>stracta sunt ; respublica, quae media fuerat, dilacerata.
</p>
<p>Ceterum nobilitas factione magis pollebat : plebis vis,
</p>
<p>soluta atque dispersa in multitudine, minus poterat : pau-
</p>
<p>C'jrum arbitrio belli domique ^agitabatur : penes eosdem
</p>
<p>aerarium, provinciae, magistratus, gloriae trimnpliique
</p>
<p>erant : populus militia atque in )pia urguebatur ; praedas
</p>
<p>bellicas imperatores cum pauci s diripiebant. Interea pa-
</p>
<p>rentes, aut parvi liberi militum, ut quisque potentiori con-

<p>injuriam vincere. Igitur ea victoria nobilitas ex lubidine
</p>
<p>sua usa, multos mortalis ferro aut fuga exstinxit ; plusque
</p>
<p>in reliquum sibi timoris, quam potentiae, addidit. Quae

<p>res plerumque magnas civitatis pessum dedit ; dum alteri

</p>
<p>gistratum ingressus est, ^alia omnia sibi cum coUega ratus,

<p>ad bellum, quod ^esturus erat, animum intendit. Igitui

<p>Ceterum ad ea patranda senati auctoritate socii nomenque

<p>Latinum, reges ultro auxilia mittere ; postremo omnis

<p>neque laboris patiens, lingua, quam manu, promtior, prae-
</p>
<p>dator ex sociis, et ipse praeda liostium, sine imperio et

<p>modestia habitus. Ita imperatori novo plus ex malis mo-
</p>
<p>ribus soUicitudinis, quam ex copia militum auxilii, aut
</p>
<p>spei bonae accedebat. Statuit tamen Metellus, quamquam
</p>
<p>et ^aestivorum tempus comitiorum mora imminuerat, et
</p>
<p>exspectatione eventi civium animos intentos putabat, non
</p>
<p>prius bellum adtingere, quam, majorum disciplina, milites
</p>
<p>laborare coegisset. Nam Albinus, Auli fratris exercitus-
</p>
<p>que clade perculsus, postquam decreverat non egredi
</p>
<p>provincia, ^quantum temporis aestivorum in imperio fuit,
</p>
<p>plerumque milites stativis castris habebat : nisi cum odos,
</p>
<p>aut pabuli egestas locum mutare subegerat. Sed neque
</p>
<p>more militari yigiliae ^deducebantur : uti cuique lubebat,
</p>
<p>ab signis aberat. Lixae permixti cum militibus die
</p>

<p>expugTiare, pecoris et mancipiorum praedas certantes

<p>agere ; eaque mutare cum mercatoribus vino advectitio,

<p>aut fingi queunt ignaviae luxuriaeque probra, in illo exer-

<p>vitam peterent, alia omnia dederent populo Romano. Sed
</p>
<p>Metello jam antea ^experimentis cognitum erat genus

<p>Numidarum infidum, ingenio mobili, novarum rerum avi-

<p>Metellus descenderat ; ne forte cedentibus advorsariiis

<p>instare : omnibus locis Romanorurn ordines conturbare :
</p>
<p>quorum etiam qui firmioribus animis obvii hostibus fuerant,
</p>
<p>^ludificati incerto praelio, ipsi modo eminus sauciabantur,
</p>
<p>neque contra feriundi, aut manum conserendi copia erat.
</p>
<p>Antea jam docti ab Jugurtha equites, ubicumque Romano-
</p>
<p>rum turba insequi coeperat, non confertim, neque in unum

<p>sese recipiebant, sed alius alio quam maxume divorsi.
</p>
<p>Ita %umero priores, si ab persequendo hostis deterrere
</p>
<p>nequiverant, disjectos ab tergo, aut lateribus circumvenie-

</p>
<p>^ea vero consueti Numidarum equi facile inter virgulta eva-
</p>
<p>dere ; nostros asperitas et insolentia loci retinebant.
</p>
<p>LI. Ceterum facies totius negotii varia, incerta, ^foeda
</p>
<p>atque miserabilis : dispersi a suis pars cedere, alii inse-
</p>
<p>qui : heque signa, neque ordines observare : ubi quem-

<p>LII. Eo modo inter se duo imperatores, summi viii,
</p>
<p>certabant ; ipsi pares, ceterum opibus disparibus. Nam
</p>
<p>Metello virtus militum erat, locus advorsus : Jugurthae
</p>
<p>a]ia omnia, praeter milites, opportuna. Denique Romani,
</p>
<p>ubi intellegunt, neque sibi perfugium esse, neque ab hoste
</p>
<p>copiam pugTiandi, fieri, et jam die vesper erat ; "^advorso
</p>
<p>coUe, sicuti praeceptum fuerat, evadunt. Amisso loco,
</p>
<p>Numidae fusi fugatique : pauci interiere ; plerosque
</p>
<p>velocitas et regio hostibus ignara tutata sunt. Interea

<p>Bomilcar, quem elepbantis et parti copiarum pedestrium
</p>
<p>praefectum ab Jugurtba supra diximus, ubi eum Rutilius

<p>praetergressus est, pauUatim suos ^in aequum locum dedu-

</p>
<p>festinans pergit, quietus, uti res postulabat, aciem exornat :
</p>
<p>neque remittit, ^quid ubique hostis ageret, explorare.
</p>
<p>Postquam Rutilium consedisse jam, et animo vacuum
</p>
<p>accepit, simulque ex Jugurthae praelio clamorem augeri ;
</p>
<p>veritus, ne legatus, cognita re, laborantibus suis auxilio
</p>
<p>foret, aciem, quam diffidens virtuti militum ^arte statuerat,
</p>
<p>quo hostium itineri obficeret, latius porrigit ; eoque modo
</p>
<p>ad Rutilii castra pro c edit.
</p>
<p>LIIL RoMANi ex improviso pulveris vim magnam ani-

<p>fecti. At Romani, quamquam itinere atque opere castro-

</p>
<p>procedunt. Nam dolus Nurnidanim ^niliil langiiidi, neque
</p>
<p>remissi patiebatur. Ac primo, obscura nocte, postqiiam
</p>
<p>baud procul inter se erant, ^strepitu, velut bostes adven-
</p>
<p>tarent, alteri apud alteros formidinem simul, et tumultum
</p>
<p>facere : et paene imprudentia admissum facinus mise-
</p>
<p>rabile, ni utrimque praemissi equites rem exploravissent.
</p>
<p>Igitur, pro metu, repente gaudium exortum, milites alius
</p>
<p>alium laeti adpellant, acta edocent atque audiuut : sua
</p>
<p>quisque fortia facta ad coelum ferre. Quippe res buma-
</p>
<p>nae ita sese habent : in victoria vel ignavis gloriari licet :
</p>
<p>%dvorsae res etiam bonos detractant.
</p>
<p>LIV. Metellus in isdem castris quatriduo moratus,
</p>
<p>^saucios cum cura reficit, meritos in praeliis more militiae
</p>
<p>donat, universos in concione laudat, atque agit gratias ;
</p>
<p>hortatur, ad cetera, quae levia sunt, parem animum
</p>
<p>gerant : pro victoria satis jam pugnatum, reliquos labores
</p>
<p>pro praeda fore. Tamen interim transfugas et alios
</p>
<p>opportunos, Jugurtba ^ubi gentium, aut quid agitaret, cum
</p>
<p>paucisne esset, an exercitum baberet, ut sese victus
</p>
<p>gereret exploratum misit. At ille sese in loca saltuosa
</p>
<p>et natura munita receperat ; ibique cogebat exercitum
</p>
<p>%umero liominum ampliorem, sed bebetem infirmumque,
</p>
<p>agri ac pecoris magis, quam belli cultorem. Id "^ea gratia
</p>
<p>eveniebat, quod, praeter regios equites, nemo omnium
</p>
<p>Numidarum ex fuga regem sequitur ; quo cujusque animxus
</p>
<p>fert, eo discedunt : neque' id ^flagitium militiae ducitur :
</p>
<p>ita se mores habent. Igitur Metellus ubi videt regis
</p>
<p>etiam tum animum ^ferocem ; bellum renovari, quod, nisi
</p>
<p>ex illius lubidine, geri non posset ; praeterea iniquum
</p>
<p>certamen sibi cum bostibus, minore detrimento illos vinci
</p>
<p>quam suos vincere ; statuit non praeliis, neque acie, sed
</p>
<p>alio more bellum gerundum. Itaque in Numidiae loca

<p>nbicumque res postulabat, praesidium impositum. Quae
</p>
<p>negotia multo magis, quam praeliiim male piignatum ab

<p>suis, regem terrebant : quippe, cui spes omnis in fuga
</p>
<p>gita, sequi cogebatur ; et qui ^sua loca defendere nequi-
</p>
<p>verat, in alienis bellum gerere. Tamen ex copia, quod
</p>
<p>optumuni videbatur, consilium capit : exercitum ^plerum-
</p>
<p>que in isdem locis opperiri jubet ; ipse cum delecti&
</p>
<p>equitibus Metellum seqrdtur ; nocturnis et ^aviis itineri-
</p>
<p>bus ignoratus Romanos palantis repente adgreditur :
</p>
<p>eorum plerique inermes cadunt, multi capiuntur ; nemo
</p>
<p>omnium intactus profugit : et Numidae prius, quam ex
</p>
<p>castris subveniretur, sicuti jussi erant, in proxumos coUis
</p>
<p>discedunt.
</p>
<p>LV. Interim Romae gaudium ingens ortum, cognitis
</p>
<p>Metelli rebus : ^ut seque et exercitum more majorum
</p>
<p>gereret ; in advorso loco, victor tamen virtute fuisset ;
</p>
<p>hostium agro potiretur ; JugTirtham magnificum ex Auli
</p>
<p>secordia, spem salutis in solitudine, aut fuga, coegisset
</p>
<p>habere. Itaque senatus ob ea feliciter acta dis im-

<p>MORTALiBUs ^suppLiciA decernere I civitas, trcpida antea
</p>
<p>et sollicita de belli eventu, ^laeta agere : fama de Me-
</p>
<p>tello "^praeclara esse. Igitur eo intentior ad victoriam
</p>
<p>niti, omnibus modis festinare ; cavere tamen, necubi hosti
</p>
<p>opportunus fieret : meminisse, post gloriam invidiam
</p>
<p>sequi. Ita quo clarior erat, eo magis animi anxius :
</p>
<p>neque, post insidias Jugurthae, ^efFuso exercitu praedari :
</p>
<p>ubi frumento, aut pabulo opus erat, cohortes cum omni
</p>
<p>equitatu praesidium agitabant : exercitus ^partim ipse, reli-
</p>
<p>quos Marius ducebat. Sed igni magis, quam praeda, ager
</p>
<p>vastabatur. Duobus locis, haud longe inter se, castra
</p>
<p>faciebant : ubi vi opus erat, cuncti aderant ; ceterum, quo
</p>
<p>fuga atque formido latius crescerent, ^^divorsi agebant.

<p>neque ab hoste copiam pngnandi fieri, urbem magnam,

<p>mam, statuit obpugnare ; ratus id, quod negotium posce-
</p>
<p>bat, Jugurtham labor antibus suis auxilio venturum, ibique
</p>
<p>praelium fore. At ilie, quae parabantur, a ^perfugis
</p>
<p>edoctus, magnis itineribus Metellum antevenit ; oppidanos
</p>
<p>hortatur, moenia defendant, additis auxilio perfugis, quod
</p>
<p>genus ex copiis regis, ^quia fallere nequibant, firmissu-
</p>
<p>mum. Praeterea poilicetur, in tempore semet cum exer-
</p>
<p>citu adfore. Ita compositis rebus, in loca quam maxume
</p>
<p>occulta discedit, ac post paullo cognoscit, Marium ^ex
</p>
<p>itinere frumentatura cum paucis cobortibus Siccam mis-
</p>
<p>sum ; quod oppidum primum omnium post malam pugnam
</p>
<p>ab rege defecerat. Eo cum dilectis equitibus noctu
</p>
<p>pergit, et jam egredientibus Romanis ^in porta pugnam
</p>
<p>facit : simul magna voce Siccenses liortatur, " uti cohor-
</p>
<p>tis ab tergo circumveniant : fortunam praeclari facino-
</p>
<p>ris casum dare : si id fecerint, postea sese in regno,

<p>rius signa inferre atque evadere oppido properavisset, pro-

<p>Contra ea oppidani in proxumos saxa volvere : sudes,

<p>improviso ^castra hostium cum magna manu invadit ;

<p>remissis, qui in praesidio erant, et omnia magis, quam

<p>praelium, exspectantibus, portam irrumpit. At nostri,
</p>
<p>repentino metu perculsi, sibi ^quisque pro moribus con-
</p>
<p>sulunt : alii fugere, alii arma capere : magna pars vol-
</p>
<p>nerati, aut occisi. Ceterum ex omni multitudine non

<p>amplius quadraginta, memores nominis Romani, grege
</p>
<p>facto, locum cepere, paullo, quam alii, editiorem : neque

<p>inde maxuma vi depelli quiverunt : sed tela eminus

<p>missa remittere, ^pauci in pluribus minus frustrati : sin
</p>
<p>Numidae propius accessissent, ibi vero virtutem ostendere,
</p>
<p>et eos maxuma vi caedere, fundere atque fugare. Interim
</p>
<p>Metellus, cum acerrume rem gereret, clamorem hostilem
</p>
<p>ab tergo accepit : dein, converso equo, animadvortit,
</p>
<p>fugam ^ad se vorsum fieri ; quae res indicabat popularis
</p>
<p>esse. Igitur equitatum omnem ad castra propere mittit,
</p>
<p>ac statim C. Marium cum cohortibus sociorum ; eumque,
</p>
<p>lacrumans, per amicitiam perque rempublicam obsecrat,
</p>
<p>ne quam contumeliam remanere in exercitu victore, neve

<p>hostis "^inultos abire sinat : ille brevi mandata efficit.

<p>super vallum praecipitarentur, alii ^in angustiis ipsi sibi

<p>properantes obficerent, multis amissis, in loca munita sese

</p>
<p>defecerant, satisque munitae loco, aut moenibus eraiit,
</p>
<p>praesidia imponit. ^Cetenim exercitum in provinciam qua
</p>
<p>proxuma est Numidiae hiemandi gratia collocat. Neque
</p>
<p>id tempus, ex aliorum more, quieti, aut luxuriae concedit :
</p>
<p>sed, quoniam armis bellum parum procedebat, insidias
</p>
<p>regi per amicos tender e, et eorum perfidia pro armis uti
</p>
<p>parat. Igitur Bomilcarem, qui Romae cum Jugurtha
</p>
<p>fuerat, et inde, ^yadibus datis, clam Massivae de nece
</p>
<p>judicium fugerat, quod ei, per maxumam amicitiam,
</p>
<p>maxuma copia fallendi erat, multis pollicitationibus adgre-
</p>
<p>ditur ; ac primo efiicit, uti ad se colloquendi gratia occul-

<p>tus veniat : dein fide data, " si Jugurtham vivum aut

<p>Ingenio infido, tum metuenti, ne, si pax cum Romanis

<p>fieret, ipse per conditiones ad supplicium traderetur.
</p>

</p>
<p>Igitur Jugurtlia, ubi armis virisque et pecunia spoliatus,

<p>cum ipse ^ad imperandum Tisidium vocaretur, rursus
</p>
<p>coepit 2flectere animum suum, et ex mala conscientia

<p>quam gravis casus in servitium ex regno foret ; ^iYjuJtis

</p>

</p>
<p>ingens, domi modicus, lubidinis et divitiarum victor, tan-
</p>
<p>tummodo gloriae avidus. Sed %is natus, et omnem
</p>
<p>pueritiam Arpini altus, ubi primum aetas militiae patiens
</p>
<p>fuit, ^stipendiis faciundis, non Graeca facundia, neque
</p>
<p>i^rbanis munditiis sese exercait : ita inter artis bonas
</p>

</p>
<p>consilium, et quasi per amicitiam monere, " ne tarn prava

<p>omnia omnibus cupiunda esse : debere illi res suas satis
</p>
<p>placere : postremo caveret id petere a populo Romano,
</p>
<p>quod illi ^jure negaretur.'* Postquam haec atque talia
</p>
<p>dixit, neque animus Marii flectitur, respondit, " ^ubi pri-
</p>
<p>mum potuisset per negotia publica, facturum sese, quae
</p>
<p>peteret." Ac postea saepius eadem postulanti, fertur
</p>
<p>dixisse, " ne festinaret abire : ^satis mature ilium cum
</p>
<p>filio suo consulatum petiturum." Is eo tempore contu-
</p>

</p>
<p>Quae res Marium cum pro honore, quem adfectabat, turn
</p>

</p>
<p>tudo Uticae erat, ^criminose simul, et magnifice de bello

</p>
<p>foret, si equites Romani satellites Numidae traderentur
</p>
<p>Hunc Marius ^anxium adgreditur atque hortatur, uti con-
</p>
<p>tumeliarum imperatoris cum suo auxilio poenas petat :
</p>
<p>hominem ob morbos animo parum valido secunda oratione
</p>
<p>extollit : " ilium regem, ingentem virum, Masinissae
</p>
<p>nepotem esse : si Jugurtha captus, aut occisus, imperium
</p>
<p>Numidiae sine mora habiturum : id adeo mature posse
</p>
<p>evenire, si ipse consul ad id bellum missus foret." Itaque
</p>
<p>et ilium, et equites Romanos, ^niilites et negotiatores, alios
</p>
<p>ipse, plerosque spes pacis impellit, uti Romam ad suos
</p>
<p>necessarios aspere in Metellum de bello scribant, Marium
</p>
<p>imperatorem poscant. Sic illi a multis mortalibus %o-
</p>
<p>nestissuma suffragatione consulatus petebatur : simul ea
</p>
<p>tempestate plebes, nobilitate fusa per legem Mamiliam,
</p>
<p>novos extollebat. Ita Mario cuncta procedere.
</p>

<p>cogere exercitum : civitates, quae ab se defecerant, for-

<p>et eos ipsos, qui in praesidiis erant, pecunia tentare :
</p>
<p>prorsus nihil intactum, neque quietum pati : cuncta agitare
</p>
<p>Igitur ^Vagenses, quo Metellus initio, Jugurtha pacilicante,
</p>
<p>praesidium imposuerat, fatigati regis suppliciis, neque

<p>que pro tectis aedificiorum saxa, et alia, quae locus

<p>quia illi in tanto malo turpis vita fama Integra potior,

<p>XCYJ.IL Neque in eo tarn aspero negotio territus Ma-

</p>

</p>
<p>uti reges praeceperant, ^noctem pro se rati, acrius instare.
</p>
<p>Tum Marius ex copia rerum consilium trahit, atque, uti

<p>suis receptui locus esset, collis duos propinquos inter se
</p>
<p>occupat : quorum in uno, castris parum amplo, fons aquae

<p>magnus erat ; alter usui opportunus, quia, magna parte

<p>apud aquam Sullam cum equitibus noctem %gitare jubet
</p>
<p>Ipse paullatim disperses milites, neque minus hostibus
</p>
<p>conturbatis, in unum contraliit ; dein cunctos ^pleno grada
</p>
<p>in collem subducit. Ita reges, loci difficultate coacti,
</p>
<p>praelio deterrentur ; neque tamen sues longius abire
</p>
<p>sinunt, sed, utroque colle multitudine circumdato, ^effusi
</p>
<p>consedere. Dein crebris ignibus factis, plerumque noctis
</p>
<p>barbari suo more laetari, exsultare, strepere vocibus :
</p>
<p>^ipsi duces feroces, quia non fugerant, pro victoribus

<p>sita : ^animi imperio, corporis servitio, magis utimur : al-
</p>
<p>terum nobis cum dis, alterum cum belluis commune est.

<p>gloriam quaerere ; et, quoniam vita ipsa, qua fruimur,

<p>brevis est, ^memoriam nostri quam maxume longam ein-

</p>
<p>XXIL FuERE ea tempestate, qui dicerent, Catilinain,
</p>
<p>oratione habita, cum ad jusjurandum popularis sceleris
</p>
<p>sui adigeret, %umani corporis sanguinem, vino perniix-
</p>
<p>tum, in pateris circumtulisse ; ^inde cum post exsecra-
</p>
<p>tionem omnes degustavissent, sicuti in solemnibus sacris
</p>
<p>fieri consuevit, aperuisse consilium suum, ^atque eo, dicti-
</p>
<p>tare, fecisse, quo inter se fidi magis forent, ^alius alii
</p>
<p>tanti facinoris conscii. NonnuUi ficta haec, multa prae-
</p>
<p>terea, existumabant, ab iis, qui ^Ciceronis invidiam., quae
</p>
<p>postea orta est, leniri credebant atrocitate sceleris eorum,
</p>
<p>qui poenas dederant. Nobis ea res ^pro magnitudine
</p>
<p>parum comperta est.
</p>
<p>XXIII. Sed in ea conventiorie fuit Q. Curius, natus
</p>
<p>haud obscuro loco, fiagitiis atque facinoribus coopertus ;
</p>
<p>quem censores senatu, probri gratia, "^araoverant. Huic
</p>
<p>homini non minor ^vanitas, quam audacia : neque reti-
</p>
<p>cere, quae audierat, neque suamet ipse scelera occultare :
</p>
<p>^prorsus neque dicere, neque facere, quidquam pensi lia-
</p>
<p>bebat. Erat ei cum Fulvia, muliere nobiii, ^^vetus con-
</p>
<p>suetudo : cui cum minus gratus esset, quia inopia minus
</p>
<p>largiri poterat, repente glorians ^^maria montesque polli-
</p>
<p>ceri coepit ; minari interdum ferro, nisi ^^obnoxia foret ;
</p>
<p>postremo ferocius agitare, quam soiitus erat. At Fulvia,
</p>
<p>^^insolentiae Curii caussa cognita, tale periculum reipub-
</p>
<p>iicae haud occultum habuit ; sed, ^^sublato auclore, de
</p>
<p>Cadlinae conjuratione quae quoque modo audierat, com-
</p>
<p>pluribus narravit. Ea res imprimis studia hominum ac-
</p>
<p>cendit ad consulatum m.andandnm ^^M. TuUio Ciceroni,
</p>
<p>Namque antea ^^pleraque nobilitas invidia aestuabat, et

</p>
<p>modo quaestui, neque luxuriae, modum fecerat, aes
</p>

</p>
<p>bat posse ^servitia urbana soUicitare, urbem incendere,
</p>
<p>viros earum vel adjungere sibi, vel interficere.
</p>
<p>XXV. Sed in his erat "^Sempronia, quae multa saepe
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>saepe antehac fidem prodiderat, ^^creditum abjuraverat,

</p>
<p>lepos inerat.
</p>
<p>XXVI. His rebus comparatis, Catilina nihilo minus in

<p>proxumum annum consulatum petebat ; sperans, si ^^de-
</p>
<p>signatus foret, facile se ex voluntate Antonio usurum.
</p>
<p>Neque interea quietus erat, sed omnibus modis insidias

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>TO THE
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR.
</p>
<p>1. Falso queritur, &c. "Mankind complain without reason 1
</p>
<p>of their nature." Falso, literally, " falsely," " erroneously." 
</p>
<p>Sallust has been justly blamed for the introductions to his histories.
</p>
<p>They have little if any relation to the subject which they are in
</p>
<p>tended to usher in, and are too discursive and long.
</p>
<p>2. Qicod inibecilla, &c. '' That, being weak and of short duration
</p>
<p>it is influenced m.ore by chance, than by the exertion of intellect."-
</p>
<p>Imhecilla agrees with natura. The less usuarl form of this adjective
</p>
<p>is imhecillis.  Virtute is here equivalent to virtute animi.
</p>
<p>3. Nam contra. " For, on the contrary."
</p>
<p>4. hivenias. ** You will find, I think."  The subjunctive is here
</p>
<p>employed to convey a softened assertion, indicative of modesty on
</p>
<p>the part of the writer, and not of any doubt in his mind on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject which he is discussing. So crediderim is frequently used, in
</p>
<p>the sense of " I am inclined to believe."
</p>
<p>5. Magisque naturae, &c. *' And that active exertion is more
</p>
<p>wanting to the nature of men, than ability or duration," i. e. than
</p>
<p>additional power or an enlarged period of existence.  Naturae
</p>
<p>hor/iinum is equivalent to homini, " And that man stands more in
</p>
<p>need of," &c.
</p>
<p>6. Sed dux atque imperator, &c. A refutation of those who
</p>
<p>maintain, that human nature is influenced more by chance than by
</p>
<p>any exertion of the mental powers.  Sed may be rendered " Now."
</p>
<p>Dux atque iraperator. *' The director and ruler." Imperator
</p>
<p>rises in force of meaning above dux. The former means literally,
</p>
<p>" coiamander in chief;" whereas dux means the highest of the in-
</p>
<p>ferior officers, having himself an important command. These are
</p>
<p>here applied to one and the same objects, for the purpose of shov^ing
</p>
<p>the all-controlling power of the mind.
</p>
<p>7. Grassatur, " Aspires." Literally, ^' moves boldly on."
</p>
<p>8. Pollens potensque. " Powerful and vigorouo." Pollens rcfert

<p>122 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page
</p>
<p>J 9 Quippe prohtoJern, <&c. " Since it (i. e. fortune) can neithei
</p>
<p>give, nor take away, integrity, activity, nor other praiseworthy quali
</p>
<p>tics." Industria here means an active exercise of our abilities 
</p>
<p>The student will notice the use of artis for artes. Sallust is very
</p>
<p>much attached to this form of the accusative, omuls for omncs^ po-
</p>
<p>pularis for populares, &c. It is called an archaism, (a term gene-
</p>
<p>rally applied to the use of antiquated or obsolete forms of expression,)
</p>
<p>though not very correctly, since the termination in is would seem
</p>
<p>to have been most commonly employed in the best ages of Latinity.
</p>
<p>The common grammatical rule is, that nouns, whose genitive plural
</p>
<p>ends in ium-, have es, is, or eis, in the accusative plural.
</p>
<p>10. Ad iiiertiam et vohiptatis corporis, &:c. " It has been con-
</p>
<p>signed to the destructive bondage of sloth and corporeal gratifica-
</p>
<p>tions." The literal meaning oi pes sum appears to be " down," " to
</p>
<p>the bottom," "under foot." Hence pessumdo literally means,
</p>
<p>*'to send or throw to the bottom," and then figuratively, "to
</p>
<p>ruin or destroy."  Yoluptatis is put for voluptates. See previous
</p>
<p>note.
</p>
<p>11. Perniciosa luhdrne, &c. In rendering, begin with uhi, "when
</p>
<p>after it has enjoyed for a season this destructive indulgence," &c.
</p>
<p>12. Suam quisque culpam, &c. " The authors of these evils
</p>
<p>transfer each to affairs the blame that is their own." They allege
</p>
<p>in exteimation of their mental inactivity, that the affairs to which they
</p>
<p>had directed their attention proved too difficult of accomplishment.
</p>
<p>13. Quod si hominibus, &c. "But if mankind were inspired
</p>
<p>with as great a regard for things conducive to their welfare, as is
</p>
<p>.he zeal with which they seek after," &c.  Alieiia, " things foreign
</p>
<p>to their nature."
</p>
<p>14. Neque regerentur, &c. " They would not be more controlled
</p>
<p>by, than they would themselves control, the chances of fortune."
</p>
<p>15. Uhi, pro mortalihus. " In which, as far as is consistent with
</p>
<p>mortal lot." Pro mortalihus, \\teidX\y, " for mortals." Equivalent
</p>
<p>to quaienus mortalihus fas est.

</p>
<p>" drop off."
</p>
<p>20. Ingcjiii egregia faciiiora. " The splendid exertions of intel-
</p>
<p>lect."  Facinus denotes a bold or daring action, and unless it bo
</p>
<p>joined with a favourable epithet, or the action be previously ae-
</p>
<p>scribed as commendable, the term is always to be understood in a
</p>
<p>JUGURTHIXE ^VAR. 123
</p>
<p>Page,

<p>vimpera' ive sense. In the present passage, the epithet egreghis 1
</p>
<p>marks the character of the action as praiseworthy.
</p>
<p>21. Corporis et fortunae banorum. " Of the advantages of person
</p>
<p>and fortune."

</p>
<p>things, and is itself controlled by none." After halctur under.stand

</p>
<p>artibus animi.
</p>
<p>6. Omnis cura, &c. "All change of public affairs," or " every

</p>
<p>7. Qiioniam neque xirtutiy &c. " Since, neither, on the one
</p>
<p>hand, is the honour, that is its due, rendered to merit, nor are they,
</p>
<p>on the other, who have obtained authority by unfair means," 6:c. 
</p>
<p>The allusion in fraiideni is to briber}' and other unworthy and de-
</p>
<p>grading practices.
</p>
<p>8. Parentes. " Subjected states." From pareo, " to obey,"
</p>
<p>and having the first syllable long. In pare-ntes, "parents," it is
</p>
<p>short.  The word occurs again in the first chapter of this histor}^
</p>
<p>9. Delicta corrigas, "may rectify abuses."  Importunum, "a

<p>from the storm.
</p>

<p>12. Gratifcari. . " Of sacrificing." i. e. Tanquam rem graiam
</p>
<p>devovere.  More usual Latinity would require gratificandi ; but Sal
</p>
<p>lust is fond of unusual forms of expression.

<p>2 17. Certe, &c Supply the ellipsis as follows: ''Jicerte tioc
</p>
<p>facient, quibus,'''' &c.
</p>
<p>18. Salutare plebem. " To court the favour of the populace."
</p>
<p>Referring to the acts of candidates in electioneering for office, going
</p>
<p>around, addressing in a friendly manner, shaking hands with voters,
</p>
<p>19. Quibus temjporibus. Sallust obtained the office of qusestor,
</p>
<p>which entitled him to a seat in the senate, at the age of twenty-
</p>
<p>seven, a few years after the conspiracy of Catiline, and while the
</p>
<p>ptate was tlirown into the greatest confusion by the acts of Clodius
</p>
<p>and his followers. He was made tribune of the commons six years
</p>
<p>after, on which occasion, according to some authorities, Cato was
</p>
<p>his competitor, but, according to others, when he was made pr^tor.
</p>
<p>To his success over Cato the historian alludes in the words quotes
</p>
<p>viri, &c. If this competition occurred for the office of prastor, he
</p>
<p>had no great reason to be proud of his success, since he obtained
</p>
<p>that magistracy entirely through the interest of Caesar.
</p>
<p>20. Merito. " On good grounds."  Judicium animi mutamsse.
</p>
<p>"Have altered my determination."  Aliorum negotiis. " Th
</p>
<p>active employment of others."
</p>
<p>21. Q. Maximum. Quintus Fabius ^laximus, the well-knov^^n op-
</p>
<p>ponent of Hannibal.  P. Scipionem. The elder Africanus, who con-
</p>
<p>quered Hannibal in the battle of Zama.  Solitos. Understand esse.
</p>
<p>1. Imagines. Among the Romans, those whose ancestors, or
</p>
<p>who themselves had borne any curule office, that is, had been consul,
</p>
<p>proetor, censor, or curule cedile, were called nobiles, and had the
</p>
<p>right of making images of themselves, which were kept with great
</p>
<p>care by their posterity, and exhibited only at funerals or on solemn
</p>
<p>occasions. These images were nothing more than the busts or
</p>
<p>effi-gies of the individuals, down to the shoulders, made of wax, and
</p>
<p>painted. They were placed in the atrium, or hall, of the Roman
</p>
<p>house, enclosed in wooden cases.
</p>
<p>2. Scilicet non ceram illam, &c. We must here resolve scilicet
</p>
<p>into its component members (scire licet,) and construe as follows .

</p>
<p>Scire licet non ceram illam, &c. habere. " We may Vv^ell suppose
</p>
<p>that neitner the mere wax of wliich they were made, nor the form
</p>
<p>it had assumed, possessed such power in themselves."
</p>
<p>3. Eorum. " Of the former." Referring to then* ancestors, and
</p>
<p>depending in construction on famam and gloriam. With virtus
</p>
<p>supply sua ipsorum, " their own merit." Sallust here argues in fa-
</p>
<p>vour of history, as a means of exciting to noble and praiseworthy
</p>
<p>actions, by its recounting the deeds of former days.
</p>
<p>4. His morihis. " Amid the corruption of the day." i. e Amid

</p>
<p>these manners that are now prevalent.  Quin contendat, *' who does Q
</p>
<p>not seek to vie." Quin is here equivalent to qui non.
</p>
<p>5. Homines novi. "Men of humble origin." Literally, "new
</p>
<p>men." Those who were the first of their family that had raised
</p>
<p>themselves to any curule ofiice, were called among the Romans,
</p>
<p>homines novi, in allusion to their recent admission among the no-
</p>
<p>bility.
</p>
<p>6. Furtim et jper latrocinia. " By private intrigue and open
</p>
<p>fraud." The acts of peculation, and official plunder, of which the
</p>
<p>Roman magistrates v/ere so frequently guilty, are here stigmatized,
</p>
<p>and they are spoken of as actually affording the means for farther ad-
</p>
<p>vancement in the state. Sallust himself is open to this charge.  Af-
</p>
<p>ter potius we have rejected from the text, with some of the best edi-
</p>
<p>tions, the words quam bonis artihus, as the idea is sufficiently ex-
</p>
<p>pressed by per virtutem which precedes.
</p>
<p>7. Ac non perinde habeantur. " And are not to be estima-
</p>
<p>ted according to the merit of those who fill them." Ac is more fre-
</p>
<p>quently employed after perinde than ut. But its occurrence at the
</p>
<p>beginning of the clause prevents its being again employed on the
</p>
<p>principle of euphony.
</p>
<p>8. Liberius altiusque. " Too freely and too far." Com
</p>
<p>pare remarks under note 1, page 1.  Redeo. Put here for eo,
</p>
<p>i. e. venio, the compound for the simple. " I now come to my subject."

</p>
<p>midia answers in some measure to the modern Algiers. Consult
</p>
<p>Geographical Index.
</p>
<p>10. Atrox. "Bloody."  Variaque victoria fuit. "And the suc-
</p>
<p>cess was various," i. e. and marked by various turns of fortune ;
</p>
<p>victory inclining sometimes to the side of the Romans, and then
</p>
<p>again to that of Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>11. Obviam itum est. " Successful opposition was made."  Di-
</p>
<p>vina et humana cuncta. " All things religious and civil," i. e. the
</p>
<p>whole state.  Studiis civilibus, " to the dissensions of the state,"

</p>
<p>or simply, " civil dissensions." 'With faceret understand solum or
</p>
<p>tantum, "only."
</p>
<p>12. Pauca supra repetam. " I will take a brief review."
</p>
<p>13. Quo^ ad cognoscendum, &:c. " In order that all things may-
</p>
<p>be clearer, and placed in a more distinct point of view, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of being thoroughly understood." Ad cognoscendum, literally,
</p>
<p>" for the knowing of them.'"' The gerund, according to the gram-
</p>
<p>marians, is here taken in a passive sense. The change of meaning,
</p>
<p>however, is rather owing to the idiom of modern languages, as ap-
</p>
<p>pears from the literal force of ad cognosceiidum.

</p>
<p>*J 14. Belh Punico secundo. Consult Historical Index, for an ac-
</p>
<p>count of the Punic wars, and also for some mention of the Cartha-
</p>
<p>ginians, Hannibal, and Masinissa, under their respective heads. 
</p>
<p>Post magnitudinevi nominis Romani. *' Since the Roman name
</p>
<p>became illustrious."
</p>
<p>15. Cui postea Africano, &c. The term Africano is here put in
</p>
<p>the dative by attraction to the dative of the person. In rendering
</p>
<p>the clause, Africano must be taken as equivalent to Africani or Af-
</p>
<p>ricanus. Thus, Est mihi nomen Joanni, *' my name is John ;" for
</p>
<p>Est mihi nomen Joannis, (or Joannes.)
</p>
<p>16. Praeclara rei militaris facinora. " Brilliant military exploits."
</p>
<p>Consult note 4, page 2.  Syphace. Consult Historical Index.
</p>
<p>The proper name Syphax is said to have the penult of the genitive
</p>
<p>common. It is on the. contrary always long, for the line in Clau-
</p>
<p>dian {Bell. Gild. 91.) where the short quantity occurs, " Compuli-
</p>
<p>mus dirum Syphacem, fractumque .Metello,^^ is now altered in the
</p>
<p>best editions, after a conjecture of Earth's, and we read Hanibalem
</p>
<p>for Syphacem.
</p>
<p>17. Regi. Referring to Masinissa.
</p>
<p>18. Imperii vitaeque ejus, &c. The grant of the Romans ceased
</p>
<p>with the life of Masinissa. His son Micipsa reigned merely over
</p>
<p>that part of Numidia which had originally belonged to his parent.
</p>
<p>Cirta, and the portion of Numidia which Syphax had possessed, were
</p>
<p>formed into a Roman province. Hence imperii in the text refers to
</p>
<p>the empire of Masinissa in its full extent, embracing what he had
</p>
<p>received from the Romans.
</p>
<p>^ 1. Ahsumtis. " Being carried off."
</p>
<p>2. Eodem cultu, &c. " He reared at home in the same vj&y as
</p>
<p>he did his own children." Cultus here has reference to every thing
</p>
<p>connected with the rearing of youth. It may be rendered more
</p>
<p>literally by the term "education." Thus, "he kept at liis court,
</p>
<p>and trained up by the same system of education," &c.

<p>3. Luxu. The old dative for luxui.  Corrumpendum. " To be

<p>corrupted by them." Literally, "for a corrupting by means of
</p>
<p>them." Understand illis in the ablative, and consult note 13,

</p>
<p>4. Equitare, jaculari, &c. " He engaged in feats of horseman-
</p>
<p>ship, he learned to liirow the lance," &c. The infiftitive is here
</p>
<p>put for the imperfect of the indicative, a practice of which Saliust is
</p>
<p>perhaps fonder than any other writer. Grammarians term it the
</p>
<p>historical infinitive, as being principally used in historical narratives,
</p>
<p>in ordf r to give an air of rapidity and animation to the sentence.

<p>6. Hominem''adolescentem. " The young man." Sallust, by a
</p>
<p>species of archaism (note 9, p. 1.) here uses adolescens, with homo
</p>
<p>expressed, as a verbal adjective. Adolescens is, strictly speaking,
</p>
<p>a verbal, and means " one growing up."  Exactasua aetate. " His
</p>
<p>own age being far advanced."
</p>
<p>7. Magis magisque crescere. " Increased more and more in
</p>
<p>reputation." Crescere is here the ordinary infinitive, preceded in

<p>Q however, is more forcible, and carries with it an air of greater cer-
</p>
<p>tainty.  Jum agitarem. " While I was zealously acting in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance with." The student will note the peculiar force of the
</p>
<p>frequentative.  Ei jam ah stripe^ &c. " And even by my very
</p>
<p>lineage the ally and friend," &c. i. e. the hereditary ally and friend.
</p>
<p>3. Atqwe ego, &c. The general idea, intended to be conveyed
</p>
<p>by this whole passage, is as follows : I could have wished, conscript
</p>
<p>fathers, since I was destined to be plunged into this misery, that
</p>
<p>I might have been able to implore your aid, rather on account of my
</p>
<p>own services, than those of my ancestors ; and above all, that T
</p>
<p>might have merited the gratitude of Rome, v/ithout needing her pro-
</p>
<p>tection ; or that, in case I did stand in need of it, I might have
</p>
<p>received it as my due. As, however, innocence is of itself but a
</p>
<p>weak defence, &c.
</p>
<p>4. Vellem. To be rendered as if voluissem.  Mea. " Services that
</p>
<p>I might have rendered."  Oh majorum henejicia. " On account of

<p>any rendered by my ancestors."  Ac maxume. " And above all." 
</p>
<p>Deheri mihi. " That favours might have been owing to me. " 
</p>
<p>Secundum ea. "Next to this," or, more freely, " in the next place."
</p>
<p>Equivalent to secundo loco quihus. Some editions read secundum
</p>
<p>with a comma after it, separating it from ea. Secundum will then
</p>
<p>mean " in the next place," and ea be joined in construction with
</p>
<p>desideranda essent.
</p>
<p>5. Neque mihi in manufuit, &c. " Nor was it in my power to
</p>
<p>form the character of Jugurtha." Literally, " to effect what kind
</p>
<p>of person Jugurtha should be." After foret the verb ejicere may
</p>
<p>be understood, although this is not necessaiy, since the clause,
</p>
<p>qualis foret Jugurtha, may be regarded as the subject nominative to
</p>
<p>fuit.
</p>
<p>6. Quo tempore, &c. This refers to the Romans, v/ho were, at the
</p>
<p>time to which the prince alludes, engaged in an important and diffi-
</p>
<p>cult war with the Carthaginians, and might be faithful, but could

</p>
<p>a collective noun, and to the idea of majores implied in it.  Nihil

<p>wretched."

<p>8. Tarn.en erat. *' Still it were." Erat is here used instead of

<p>esset, to denote more of certainty by means of the indicative.  Neque

<p>cujasquam, &c. *' And that the kingdom of no one should increase
</p>
<p>m power, by the commission of crime." There is no need of un-

<p>1. Bla pestis. " That plague." Referring to the Carthaginians. 10
</p>
<p> Pacem agitabamus. The frequentative is frequently employed
</p>
<p>by Sallust for the simple verb to give more fulness to the style.
</p>
<p>Agitabamus is here put for agehamus.  Quis for quihus.  Ouem
</p>
<p>jussissetis. " Him, whom you might have ordered us to regard as
</p>
<p>such."
</p>
<p>2. Sese ecferens. . An archaism for sese efferens, and this equiva-
</p>
<p>lent to elatus, " hurried av^ay."  Atque eodem. " And who was at
</p>
<p>the same tim^e."
</p>
<p>3. Isdem. An archaism for iisdem.  Nihil minus, quam, (fee. " Ex
</p>
<p>pecting nothing so little as violence or war, in a country subjected
</p>
<p>to your authority."
</p>
<p>4. Extorrem patria, &lc. The student will note the imitation of
</p>
<p>the Greek idiom, in which Sallust here indulges. Effecit me extor-
</p>
<p>rem, (fee, ut essem, instead of effecit uti ego nihil minus quam, (fee.
</p>
<p>exspectans, sicuti videtis, extorris patria, domo, inops, coojjertus
</p>
<p>iniseriis, ubivis tutius quam in regno meo essem.
</p>
<p>5. MuUum laborem suscipere. ''Undertook an arduous task."
</p>
<p>The prince now enters on the following argument :  If my ancestors
</p>
<p>embraced the friendship and alliance of Rome, not from motives of
</p>
<p>indolence, nor from a wish to lead an easy and inactive life, but
</p>
<p>well knowing, on the contrary, how many arduous labours they

<p>10. Adjifies, amicos, &c. "One disaster has crushed ere,
</p>
<p>another has crushed another, of my relatives, my friends, the rest of
</p>
<p>those who were near to me." Sallust is very fond of the construction

<p>with alius. Ii must be repeated in translating.

<p>11. Pars .... acti. An instance of the figure which gram-
</p>
<p>marians call synesis, where the adjective, participle, &:c. refer to
</p>
<p>the person or persons implied by a word, and do not agree in gender
</p>
<p>with the word itself. Acti, in this clause, and ohjccti, in the next,

<p>gender.

<p>who are connected with us by the ties of consanguinity. And hence
</p>
<p>the term 7iCssitudo is used for relationship or any intimate con-

<p>136 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>1^ 2 The reason ot this appellation is more apparent, however, in Greek
</p>
<p>from its taking the prepositive article before it in all cases ; as to
</p>
<p>yoivpeiv, Tov ypixipsiv, tw yplpav. The same construction is not un-
</p>
<p>known in English. Thus Spenser : 
</p>
<p>"For not to have been dipped inLetlie lake,
</p>
<p>Could save the son of Thetis from to die."
</p>
<p>11. Ncu jure conicmtus, &c. " And that I might not appear a
</p>
<p>just object bf contempt." Cortius reads vivere instead ot jure, and
</p>
<p>makes it equivalent to vivcrem, regarding vidcrer as a mere appen-
</p>
<p>dage to the sentence, in imitation of the Greek idiom, where words
</p>
<p>that refer literally to what appears to be the case, are sometimes
</p>
<p>taken in the sense of reality, and refer to what is actually the case ;
</p>
<p>such as 0atVw, 6oKM, &c. Other editions have vere.

</p>
<p>Ite ohviaw. injuriae. " Set your faces against injustice."  Tabes-
</p>
<p>cere. " To fall by degrees to ruin." A metaphor borrowed from
</p>
<p>the effects of a w^asting malady on the human frame. The guilt of
</p>
<p>Jugurtha is to prove, if unchecked by Roman power, a corroding
</p>
<p>canker, that will consume by degrees all the prosperity of Nu-
</p>
<p>midia.

<p>importaosum apparently contradicts the expression portuosior, ap-
</p>
<p>plied at the close of the preceding chapter to the part of Numidia
</p>
<p>assigned by the Roman commissioners to Adherbal : there, however,
</p>
<p>it only means " better provided with harbours" than the part given

<p>to Jugurtha, without meaning to convey the idea that they were ma-

<p>appear that the information derived from them by Sallust was of the
</p>
<p>most accurate character. (Compare note 3.)

<p>Gibraltar, where the land, bending outward, appears to be embraced

</p>
<p>JSumidae really denote a pastoral people, and be derived from lA
</p>
<p>vofjLY], (" pasture,") as Sallust supposes, it must have been given to
</p>
<p>the people who bore it by the Greeks, among v^hom the term
</p>
<p>NoiidSeg was applied to pastoral nations in general. Le Clerc {ad
</p>
<p>Genes. 10, 6.) derives the appellation iVwmm'ae from the Phoenician
</p>
<p>Nemoudiin, " wanderers."
</p>
<p>3. Mapalia. This term appears to be analogous to our English
</p>
<p>wora "huts." The Numidian ma^a^m were constructed of reeds
</p>
<p>and other similar materials, according to Silius Italicus (17, 88.)
</p>
<p>From Sallust's description they would seem to have resembled the
</p>
<p>dwellings of many barbarous tribes of the present day. The ancient
</p>
<p>writers make mention also of Numidian magalia. According tc
</p>
<p>some, the magalia were fixed abodes, forming villages and towns ;
</p>
<p>whereas the mapalia were moveable dwellings, and were carried
</p>
<p>about on wagons according as this nomadic race changed their
</p>
<p>place of residence. Mapalia has the first syllable ^hort, but magalia
</p>
<p>long. Servius makes the true orthography of the latter 77tagaria,
</p>
<p>and derives the word from the Phoenician magar, equivalent as he
</p>
<p>informs us, to the Latin ^^villa.''^

</p>
<p>the parent state, though it had become in some degree united with
</p>
<p>the Gaetuli by intermarriage, yet still found in many tribes of that
</p>
<p>nation very powerful opponents, who prevented by their continual
</p>
<p>hostilities any very rapid increase of national strength. It will be
</p>
<p>perceived that Sallust, in the course of this history, makes the
</p>
<p>Gaetuh a distinct people from the Numidians, so that the union to
</p>
<p>which he refers could not have been a very strong or extensive one.

</p>
<p>Dolore permotum. " Stung with indignation." The primitive

<p>meaning of dolor is the smarting sensation attendant on a wound.
</p>
<p>It becomes therefore a strong term when applied to the moral feel-

<p>and that then he could easily buy off the resentment of the latter.
</p>
<p>5. Co7itumeliosa dicta. " An insulting reply." Contumelia,

</p>
<p>" Of Romans." Referring^to the Romans (whether natives of Rome
</p>
<p>or provincials enjoying the rights of citizenship) who were dwelling
</p>
<p>at Cirta for commercial or other puiposes. The Romans, from their
</p>
<p>use of the toga., were called gens togata, or simply togati. The
</p>
<p>Greeks, from their wearing the 'pallium, were denominated by the
</p>
<p>Romans, palliati, or gens palliata ; and the Gauls, from their use of
</p>
<p>the h'arxae, a species of striped under-garments,. o-e/z^ hraccata.
</p>
<p>2. Vineis. The vineae were machines in the form of sheds, and
</p>
<p>constructed of wood and hurdles, covered with earth or raw hides,
</p>
<p>or any materials which could not easily be set on fire. They were
</p>
<p>pushed forward by wheels below. Under them the besiegers either
</p>
<p>worked the ram, or tried to undermine the walls.  Turrihusque.
</p>
<p>The turres, or towers, were of two kinds ; fixed and moveable. The
</p>
<p>fixed towers were raised on the agger, or mound, and consisted cf
</p>
<p>different stories, from which showers of darts and stones were dis-
</p>
<p>charged by means of engines called catapuUar, halistae, and
</p>
<p>scorpiones. The moveable towers were pushed forward and brought
</p>
<p>back on wheels, fixed below, on the inside of the planks. To
</p>
<p>prevent them from being set on fire by the enemy, the towers,
</p>
<p>both fixed and moveable, but more particularly the latter, were
</p>
<p>covered with raw hides, and pieces of coarse cloth, and mattresses.
</p>
<p>3. Tempus legatorum antecapere. " To anticipate the return of
</p>
<p>the ambassadors."  Tres adolescentes. Cortius thinks that these
</p>
<p>words are a mere gloss, and ought to be removed from the text.
</p>
<p>The opinion does not seem very probable, as a copyist would in all
</p>
<p>likelihood have added any thing else rather than these particular
</p>
<p>words. Com.pare also chapter 25, w^hero it is stated that majores
</p>
<p>natu, nohiles, amplis honoribus, were sent as amibassadors. Tres
</p>
<p>adolescentes, therefore, is in the manner of Sallust.

<p>4. Velle et censere. " That it was their wash and determination."

<p>his former meritorious conduct.  Oh easdem artis, " That, from

<p>principatus, conferred no command or emolument, but yet was

</p>
<p>be rendered as two verbs. " Tortures and puts to death." The
</p>
<p>participle is often elegantly put under the government of the verb in
</p>
<p>the succeeding clause ; an arrangement which sometimes contributes
</p>
<p>much to perspicuity, as well as precision.  Omnis puberes " AB.
</p>
<p>the young men."  Negotiatqres. Referring to the Italian traders. 
</p>
<p>Obviics. " Cam-e in contact vvith."
</p>
<p>2. Ministri. " Tools." Sallust here purposely employs the
</p>
<p>term ministri, to convey to the reader a just idea of the degrading
</p>
<p>conduct of the Roman nobility.  Interpellando. " By interrupting
</p>
<p>the course of public business."  Gratia. " By their influence with
</p>
<p>individual senators."  Leniebant. " Strove to soften down."
</p>
<p>3. Trihinus plebis . The tribunes ofthe commons were the famous
</p>
<p>popular magistrates, who, by repeated attacks on the nobility, event-
</p>
<p>aally brought over the government of Rome from an aristocratic to
</p>
<p>a democratical form. They were created originally A. U. C. 260,
</p>
<p>at the time of the secession to the sacred m.ount, for the purpose
</p>
<p>Df protecting the rights of the people. Their power was almost
</p>
<p>destroyed by Sylla, but was subsequently re-established in the time
</p>
<p>of Pompey and Crassus. They then became mere tools in the
</p>
<p>hands of the leading men.

</p>
<p>of the nobility."  Potentia. This term generally refers to power of
</p>
<p>our own acquiring ; potestas, to delegated authority. The former
</p>
<p>answers to the Greek teiTa'Hvaing, the latter to tgovrria. Here the
</p>
<p>power of the nobility is called potentia, from its being of a usurped
</p>
<p>character.  Id agi. " That this was in agitation," or more freely

<p>away, in consequence of the frequent postponements of their delib-
</p>

<p>potential, to give more liveliness to the representation.

</p>
<p>creed to the consuls by the senate after the election, or when they

<p>or lump." We have nothing in English that can answer as a close
</p>
<p>and exact translation of the phrase per saturam. The term satura
</p>
<p>is properly an adjective with lanx understood, and signifies, literally,
</p>
<p>the dish or platter, annually filled with all sorts of fruits, and offered
</p>
<p>to the gods as the first-fruits of the season. From this medley, the
</p>
<p>term is figuratively used in our text to denote a confused and pro-
</p>
<p>miscuous collecting of the votes. In like manner, a lex satura
</p>
<p>(where satura is again merely an adjective, agreeing with Zex,) was
</p>
<p>one that embraced many topics unconnected with each other ; and
</p>
<p>it was a rule of the Roman code, that no existing law be abrogated
</p>
<p>by a lex satura, on account of the unfairness of such a mode of pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, and the J facilities which it afforded for taking by surprise.
</p>
<p>So, again, the Latin term satira, takes its name from this source,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the medley of verses of different metres, and
</p>
<p>topics of various natures, which the earlier writers of satire were
</p>
<p>accustomed to employ. Varro even mixed prose with poetry, and
</p>
<p>called these pieces satirae.
</p>
<p>7. Pro consilio. " Before the council." This signification of
</p>
<p>pro is derived immediately from that of the Greek -rrpd.  Ad magis-
</p>
<p>tratus rogandos. " To hold the election for magistrates." More
</p>
<p>literally, " to preside at," &c. The usual beginning of all applica-
</p>
<p>tions to the people Vv^as Velilis, jubeatis, Quirites ; and thus the
</p>
<p>people were said to be consulted or asked, (consuli siverogari,) and

<p>.he presiding magistrate to consult or ask them. Hence rogare
</p>
<p>magistratus, " to create magistrates," or, as here, to preside at their
</p>
<p>election; rogare quaesitores, "to appoint commissioners." And
</p>
<p>nence also, ro^a^^io is a " bill," v\^hile the matter is still pending,
</p>
<p>out lex, " a law," when it has been favourably received by the
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>1. De facto consulis agitari. " The conduct of the consul was a 2 J
</p>
<p>theme of conversation."  Gravis invidia. " Deep indignation."

</p>
<p>must be made to fall on patres' as opposf^d toj?^e55W in the previous

<p>*^ J part of the sentence, and patres will then have in our idiom the fores
</p>
<p>of an accusative, (as if governed by quod ad understood,) though in
</p>
<p>fact the nominative to probarent. '' As to the senate, it was uncer-
</p>
<p>tain whether they would approve of so disnonourable a course ot
</p>
<p>conduct," &c.
</p>
<p>2. Clara pollensquefuit. " Was distinguished and influential,"
</p>
<p>1. e. was of a high character itself, and exercised a strong influence
</p>
<p>over the minds of the people.  Perscribere. " To give entire."
</p>
<p>The speech, however, although this phraseology is here employed,
</p>
<p>is the mere production of the historian.  Ac potissumum. Under-
</p>
<p>stand earn orationcm.
</p>
<p>3. Dehortantur. The indicative is used here, in the place of the
</p>
<p>subjunctive dehortentui; to impart more force and certainty to the
</p>
<p>sentence. Render the whole clause as follows : " Did not, O Ro-''
</p>
<p>mans, my zeal for the public welfare overcome every other consid-
</p>
<p>eration, many things would dissuade me from espousing your cause."
</p>
<p>If dehortarentur and superarent had been employed, the meaning
</p>
<p>would have been : " Had not a regard, &c. overcome every other
</p>
<p>consideration, many things would have dissuaded me," &c.
</p>
<p>4. His an7iis quindecim. Twenty-two years had in fact elapsed
</p>
<p>since the death of Tiberius Gracchus, and t^n since that of his
</p>
<p>brother Caius. Sallust, if the reading be correct, takes a kind ot
</p>
<p>middle period between the two dates.  Quam ludihrio fueritis.
</p>
<p>*' What a sport you have been," i. e. with what insolent scorn
</p>

<p>to the Gracchi.
</p>
<p>5. Ut vobis, &c. " To what a degree your spirit has become
</p>
<p>enfeebled by cowardice and sloth "  Ignavia properly denotes slow-

</p>
<p>cordia, want of heart to begin, slowness in deliberating, &c.

<p>is this : If I cannot break the power of the opposite faction, I still will
</p>
<p>try to preserve my own freedom. That freedom is the inheritance 1
</p>
<p>received from my fathers ; it is my own property, and I will enjoy it
</p>
<p>as my own, but then I must be aided in this by you. Certe may be

</p>
<p>nature of the enterprise. There will be no reed of arms, no need g 1
</p>
<p>of a secession, &c. When he speaks of asserting his own freedom,
</p>
<p>he means of course theirs also, only this way of expressing himself
</p>
<p>is more calculated to arouse their feelings.
</p>
<p>10. Secessione. Three secessions of the people are recorded in
</p>
<p>Roman history. The first took place, A. U. C. 260, on account of
</p>
<p>the severity of creditors, and was made to the sacred mount. The
</p>
<p>second was occasioned by the conduct of Appius Claudius, the
</p>
<p>decemvir, and was made first to the iVventine, and afterwards to
</p>
<p>the sacred mount. It happened, A. U. C. 305. The third was pro-
</p>
<p>duced by the same cause as the first, and was made to the Janicu-
</p>
<p>lum, A. U. C. 466.
</p>
<p>11. Suomet more.' " In their own way," i. e. by the natural con-
</p>
<p>sequences of their vices and crimes.
</p>
<p>12. Quae^tiones habitae sunt. " Severe investigations were in-
</p>
<p>stituted." Velleius Paterculus (2, 6.) informs us, that after the
</p>
<p>murder of Tiberius Gracchus, the consuls Rutilius and Popilius
</p>
<p>pursued very cruel and vigorous measures against the partisans of
</p>
<p>that individual.  Post C. Gracchi et M. Fuhii caedem, &c. Con-
</p>

</p>
<p>13. Utriusque cladis. *' Of either massacre."
</p>
<p>14. Sed sanefuerit, &c. " But let it indeed have been an aim-
</p>
<p>mg at supreme power (on the part of the Gracchi) to attempt the
</p>
<p>restoration of their rights to the people. Let whatever cannot
</p>
<p>be punished without shedding the blood of Roman citizens, have
</p>
<p>been justly done."  Ulcisci is here used passively, and nequitur is
</p>
<p>the passive form put, by an archaism, for nequit. The passage be-
</p>
<p>fore us is an ironical concession on the part of Memmius, and the
</p>
<p>train of ideas is as follows : I admit that the Gracchi, in seeking to
</p>
<p>restore the rights of the Roman people, were in fact only aiming at
</p>
<p>sovereign power. I am willing to allow, that the nobility, in punish-
</p>
<p>ing with death the attempts of the Gracchi and their partisans, acted
</p>
<p>with strict justice, since these attempts could have been punished

</p>
<p>would be, ad imptrandum nati.
</p>
<p>4. Occidisse iribunos plebis. " The having put to death tri-
</p>
<p>bunes of the commons." The infinitive is here employed in its
</p>
<p>original force of a verbal noun, governing the case of its verb. So

</p>
<p>The adYerbs pessume and maxume have heie the force of compara-
</p>
<p>tives. The comparative is often used for the^ superlative in Latin ;
</p>
<p>the construction of the superlative for the comparative is much more
</p>
<p>rare.
</p>
<p>6. Mctmn a scelere suo, &c. The meaning intended to be con*
</p>
<p>veyed is this : the fear v^hich the nobility ought to entertain on ac-
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>The Aventine was the most extensive of all the hills on which Rome
</p>
<p>was built. It received its name from an Alban king, who was
</p>
<p>buried on it, and was the spot vs^hich Remus chose to take the
</p>
<p>omens. On tliis last account it v/as generally regarded as a place
</p>
<p>of evil omen ; and, therefore, according to Aulus Gellius, was not
</p>
<p>included within the Pomaerium. But other and better authorities
</p>
<p>make it to have been joined to the city by Ancus Martins. Com-

<p>II. Qui si dediticius est, &c. A dilemma. The surrender in OO
</p>
<p>question is either real or unreal. If real, the Namidian will come
</p>
<p>m obedience to your command ; if unreal, he will not come ; but
</p>
<p>then his absence will form the strongest testimony against those
</p>
<p>whom we wish to convict by his evidence when present.
</p>
<p>1. Ilia. By ilia tempora he means ihe period immediately sub- gQ
</p>
<p>sequent to the slaughter of the Gracchi, when 'every thing was in
</p>
<p>the hands of the aristocracy. By haec tempora he designates the
</p>
<p>present moment, when the people are beginning to be aroused to an
</p>
<p>asserting of their rights.
</p>
<p>2. Leges, jura. " Laws, justice." The tenn leges here em-
</p>
<p>braces every thing relating to the administration of the state  and
</p>
<p>jura, on the other hand, the rights and privileges of jjAvate
</p>
<p>citizens, which rely for support on the impartial dispensing of jus
</p>
<p>tice  Bella, paces. The control of war and peace is here meant.
</p>
<p>Paces, in the plural number, is not very frequent in its occurrence,
</p>
<p>though used, notwithstanding, by some of the best writers. Compare
</p>
<p>Horace, {Ep. 1, 3, 8.) ^^ Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in
</p>
<p>aevura.^^
</p>
<p>3. Vos autem, &c. He addresses the plebeians merely, but, in
</p>
<p>order to animate them the more, he speaks to them as if they formed
</p>
<p>the true and the whole Roman people, ^^populus Romamis.''^
</p>
<p>4. Atque ego. A transition to the danger which threatens unless
</p>
<p>the guilty be punished.  Casura esset. '' Would be likely to end."
</p>
<p>5. Quantum importunitatis habent. Complete the construction
</p>
<p>as follows : Pro tanta importunitate quantum importu7iitatis Tiahent.
</p>
<p>" Such is their overbearing insolence." Precisely analogous to this
</p>
<p>is the use of the relative in such phrases as the following : " Quae
</p>
<p>tua est virtus expugnahis,''^ i. e. ea virtute, quae virtus tua est^
</p>
<p>expugnabis. " Such is your valour," &c. So again, " cujus est^

</p>
<p>7. In tarn divorsis mentihus. " Between minds actuated by such
</p>
<p>opposite sentiments."  Peculatus aerani. " Embezzlement of the
</p>
<p>public money." The speaker is endeavouring to show the full
</p>
<p>enormity of the conduct of Bestia and Scaurus, by comparing it
</p>
<p>with acts of a flagrant nature on the part of others, but which sink,
</p>
<p>by the side of the former, into comparative insignificance.

</p>
<p>The term stirps properly denotes that part of the trunk of a tree

<p>where the roots begin to branch out. Hence it is applied figu-
</p>
<p>ratively to the stock or lineage of a family, &c.  Jugurtham oh

<p>5. Movere. Some editions have moveri, but the manuscripts m
</p>
<p>general favour the active form. The construction, though a harsh
</p>
<p>one, is characteristic of Sallust. Movere governs omnia under-
</p>
<p>stood, and omnia expressed is the accusative before senescere. The
</p>
<p>meaning is, that the consul " wished to throw all things into confu-
</p>
<p>sion, than that all should begin to grow torpid" in the arms of re-
</p>
<p>' pose.

<p>reason.  Quam ex jure gentium. By the law of nations, the retinue

</p>
<p>men. The usual number, however, about the time of Polybius,
</p>
<p>was 420.

<p>3. Centurio primi pili. " The chief centurion." Each Roman
</p>
<p>legion was divided into ten cohorts ; each cohort into three maniples,
</p>
<p>and each maniple into two centuries. So that there were thirty
</p>
<p>maniples and sixty centuries in a legion. There were two centu-
</p>
<p>rions in each maniple, called by the same name, but distinguished
</p>
<p>by the title prior, "former," and posterior, "latter," because the
</p>
<p>one was chosen and ranked before the other. The centurion of the
</p>
<p>first century of the first maniple of the Triarii, was called centurio
</p>
<p>primi pili, or primus pilus, or primopilus, &c. He presided over
</p>
<p>all the other centurions, and had the charge of the eagle (aguila) or
</p>
<p>chief standard of the legion ; whereby he obtained both profit and
</p>
<p>dignity, being ranked among the equites, and having a place in the
</p>
<p>council of war with the consul and tribunes of the jsoldiers. The
</p>
<p>centurion of the second century of the first maniple of the Triarii
</p>
<p>was called primipilus posterior. So the tv/o centurions of the second
</p>
<p>maniple of the Triarii v^ere called prior centurio, and posterior cen-
</p>
<p>turio, secundipili ; and so on to the tenth, the two centurions of which
</p>
<p>were styled centurio decimipili prior, and posterior. In like manner,
</p>
<p>primus prhiceps prior, and posterior ; secundus princeps prior,
</p>
<p>and posterior, in speaking of the principes or second rank ; and
</p>
<p>primus hastatus, &:c., in reference to the hastati or first rank.
</p>
<p>Thus there w^as a large field for promotion in the Roman army :
</p>
<p>from a common soldier to a centurion ; and from being the lowest
</p>
<p>centurion of the tenth maniple of the hastati {decimus hastatus pos-
</p>
<p>terior) to the rank of primipilus.

<p>fear of death compelling the Roman soldiery to this disgraceful step.

<p>legions, and were treated with more severity than Roman citizens,
</p>
<p>being punished with stripes, and also capitally, from which citizens
</p>
<p>were exempted by the Porcian law.  The Socii mentioitcd in the

<p>same as that of the Latins.

<p>popular and an aristocratic party. The plural is here employed

</p>
<p>several distinct parties among the people and senate, but that from
</p>
<p>this time the people and senate respectively formed themselves into

<p>parties against each other. As the words mos partium would alone
</p>
<p>suffice to convey the meaning of Sallust, some editors reject the

<p>.remainder of the clause popularium., et senati factionum.

<p>enemies." Put for metus hostium.  Scilicet. Used here as an

<p>explanatory particle. Hence the clause may be rendered as follows :

<p>*' Those effects which prosperity is accustomed to produce, licen-
</p>
<p>tiousness, namely, and pride, came 7iaturally upon them," i. e.
</p>
<p>licentiousness and pride, the usual attendants of prosperity, natu-

<p>3. Asperius acerhiusque fuit. Understand quam ipsae res
</p>
<p>*adversae f Iter ant. " Proved a harsher and more galling visitation
</p>
<p>than adversity itself had been." The res adversae allude to the
</p>
<p>reverses in the second Punic war.
</p>
<p>4. Dignitatem, &e. What grammarians call a zeugma takes
</p>
<p>place in luhiclinem, which has one meaning when connected with
</p>
<p>dignitatem, and another with lihcrtatem. Render the whole clause
</p>
<p>as follows : " For the nobility began to convert their high rank into
</p>
<p>an instrument of tyranny, the people to degrade their freedom into
</p>
<p>licentiousness."

<p>away, made plunder of, every thing." These words, arranged as

</p>
<p>tion of the Greeks, they sometimes made it circular, or adapted it
</p>
<p>to the natm-e of the ground. The ditch was usually nine feet deep,
</p>
<p>and twelve feet broad. The vallum was composed of tiie earth
</p>
<p>dug from the ditch, and secured and kept firm by stakes.
</p>
<p>8. Circumire. " He went the rounds." In general, certain per
</p>
<p>sons were appointed every night to go round the watches, hence
</p>
<p>called circuitores or circitores. This seems to have been at first
</p>
<p>done by the equites and tribuni ; on extraordinary occasions, as in
</p>
<p>the present instance, by the commander in person, attended by his

<p>different nations varied in this respect. According to the scholiast
</p>
<p>on Sophocles, {Oed. T. 3,) petitioners am^ong the Greeks, usually
</p>
<p>carried boughs wrapped around with fillets of wool. Sometimes
</p>
<p>the hands were covered with these fillets, not only among the

<p>Greeks, but also among the Romans. Hence in Plautus, {Amph.

</p>
<p>something equivalent. Others make tentare the historical innnitive,

<p>and refer it to Metellus. According to both these explanations,

<p>however, the reading tentare would seem to want spirit.

<p>6. Velites. " The light-armed troops." They were first insti-

</p>
<p>lust here, by his use of the term, forum, imitates the Roman way of
</p>
<p>speaking. The word forum, when applied to towns, meant places
</p>
<p>where markets were held, and where justice also was administered.
</p>
<p>The reference in the text is to the first part of this meardng, namely
</p>
<p>Yasfa's being a market-to^^Ti and place of trade.

<p>1. Hulc consul, &c. We have here followed the reading of the Q*^
</p>

<p>for this much-contested passage. The phxrase Imic praesidium' im-
</p>
<p>posuit is the true Latin idiom, though, in translating it mto our o\va,
</p>
<p>we are compelled to give huic the force of an ablative. The mean-
</p>
<p>ing of the passage will be as follows : "In this place, the consul
</p>
<p>stationed a garrison, as well for the sake of trying Jugurtha, as
</p>
<p>of watching the result of his own plans, in case the advantages
</p>
<p>which the place afforded should allow this to be done," i. e. for the
</p>
<p>sake of sounding the real intentions of Jugurtha, and of ascertaining
</p>
<p>whether he actually desired peace or was only seeking to lay an
</p>
<p>ambuscade, and also of watching the result of his own plans for the
</p>
<p>assassination or seizure of Jugurtha by the ambassadors ; if, upon

<p>3. Conspicatur. Thus far Salliist has shown us Jugurtha, ac-
</p>
<p>tively employed among his folio w^ers. He now changes the picture,
</p>
<p>and presents us wdth Metellus, ignorant of the position of the foe,
</p>
<p>descending the mountain, and merely observing something that
</p>
<p>wore an unusual appearance on the neighbouring hill. Hence we see
</p>
<p>the propriety of conspicatur (' espies something" on the hill) as a
</p>
<p>reading, instead of the common lection, coiispicitur (" is seen" by the
</p>
<p>enemy). Metellus saw^ something on the hill, but it w^as too unde-
</p>
<p>fined t6 enable him to ascertain its nature with any kind of certainty
</p>
<p>until he came nearer,

</p>
<p>pearance m_eant."  Equi Numidaeque. " The Numidians, both
</p>
<p>horse and foot." Thus equi xirique signifies both horsemen and
</p>
<p>infantry.
</p>
<p>5. Incerti, quidnam esset. " Leaving it uncertain what the thing
</p>
<p>actually was," i. e. not entirely discernible. The term incerti refers
</p>
<p>of course to the Numidians. The adjective certus is derived from
</p>
<p>cerno and res incerta is nothing more than res non henc et distincte
</p>
<p>visa. The primitive meaning therefore of incertus is " about which
</p>
<p>there is no certamty," "undefined," "not clearly discernible." And
</p>
<p>it is used so in^the present instance. Compare the Greek form of
</p>
<p>expression, acr]^\OL -i izore rovr' av tirj.
</p>
<p>6. Agmen constitit. " He halted his army." Consisto, although

<p>coiisniit, " he stopped," understand se. In the present instance, the

</p>
<p>7. Com.mutoJis ordinibus. " Having altered the arrangement of
</p>
<p>his troops." Jugurtna, it will be recollected, had drawn up his
</p>
<p>forces on the hill, which extendedin the direction of the river, and
</p>
<p>at right angles to the mountain. Metellus was descending this
</p>
<p>mountain in order to reach the river, and consequently had Jugur-
</p>
<p>tha's ambuscade on his right flank. Thus far the Roman army w^oulH
</p>
<p>appear, from chapter 46, to have been marching in a single column.

</p>
<p>ner, into three raizks of hastati, principes, and triarii The moment
</p>
<p>Metellus perceives his danger, he converts his flank into a front, by
</p>
<p>wheeling the legions out of column into line on the right, and by
</p>
<p>bringing all the hastati of the several legions into one line ; all the
</p>
<p>principes into a second line, and all the triarii into a third. The
</p>
<p>army is then drawn up in three lines, {triplicihus subsidiis,) with its
</p>
<p>front facing the enemy. But how is it to reach the plain ] Evi-
</p>
<p>dently by a flank march on the left, and in this flank march the
</p>
<p>three ranks become so many files. Each soldier, therefore, when
</p>
<p>the word is given to continue the march down the mountain, faces
</p>
<p>to the left and moves on in file. If the enemy attacks them on
</p>
<p>their march, they face again to the front and oppose them. Compare,
</p>
<p>in further explanation of this movement, Polybius, (Lips, de Milit.
</p>

<p>from the previous line of march. Hence by primi, in this new
</p>
<p>arrangement, are meant those who formed the left wing in the old
</p>
<p>order of things, and by postremi, those who composed the old right.
</p>
<p>The primi of Jugurtha's men, on the other hand, are the left wing
</p>
<p>of the Numidians as they lie in ambuscade. The Numidians attack
</p>
<p>the postremi of Metellus, {postremos caedere,) and the moment this
</p>
<p>attack is made on the Roman flank, it faces to the right and forms
</p>
<p>a front against the enemy. This is the movement of which Sal-
</p>
<p>lust says nothing. Allien it is made, the head and rear of the Ro-
</p>
<p>man columm become respectively a new left and right wing, and
</p>
<p>the Numidians attack them on each of these new flanks, {pars a
</p>
<p>sinistra ac dexter a tentare.)
</p>
<p>3. Ludificati incerto praelio. " Baflled by this irregular mode of
</p>
<p>fighting."  Ipsi modo eminus sauciabantur. " Were themselves
</p>
<p>alone wounded from a distance," i. e. they could not wound the
</p>
<p>enemy in return.
</p>
<p>4. Numero prior es. *' Being superior in number." Referring
</p>
<p>to the Numidians.  Disjectos ah tergo aut lateribus. The terms
</p>
<p>tergum and latus are here applied not to the entire Roman
</p>
<p>army, but merely to the parties or bands which pursued the Nu-
</p>
<p>midians.
</p>
<p>5. Ea. The ablative. Understand /z/^a, and render as follows :
</p>
<p>" In prosecuting that flight, the horses of the Numidians, accus-
</p>
<p>tomed to the task, easily made their escape amid the underwood."
</p>
<p>6. Foeda atque miserabilis. " Gloomy and affecting."
</p>
<p>7. Arma, tela, &c. The absence of the connective conjunction
</p>
<p>gives an air of peculiar animation to this sentence.  Consilio neque
</p>
<p>imperio. " From previous concert, or by any regular command."

<p>l/bique is put here for etubi.  A-nimo vacuum. " Was without any

<p>apprehension of an attack." More literally, " was free (from appre-
</p>
<p>hension) in mind."  Ex Jugurthae praelio. " From the quarter
</p>
<p>where Jugurtha was engaged."
</p>
<p>4. Arte. " In close order." An archaism for arete. Quo hos-

</p>
<p>the return of Rutiiius, in case he might wish to march back to the
</p>
<p>army of Metellus.
</p>
<p>5. Prospeetum. "Any distant view." Hence the army of Bo-
</p>
<p>miicar was not seen until quite near, and the dust itself was only
</p>
<p>beheld on a sudden, {ex improviso).  Et primo rati, &lc. "And
</p>
<p>at first they thought that the arid sm-face of the ground was only
</p>
<p>swept by the w^ind," i. e. that it was only the wind sweeping over
</p>
<p>an arid and sandy surface, and raising a large cloud of dust."
</p>
<p>6. Aequabilem manere. " That it remained of a uniform ap

<p>8. Fessi laetique erant. We have recalled the readuig of Cortius,
</p>
<p>laeti, and have changed that of the previous edition la.ssi. The
</p>
<p>meaning intended to be conveyed by Sallust appears to be this.
</p>
<p>The Romans were fatigued by a long march, and the throwing up
</p>
<p>the works of a camp, as well as by their exertions in the fight,
</p>
<p>and were at the same time rejoiced at their victory. But although
</p>
<p>in this state, and desirous, under the influence of these feehngs, of
</p>
<p>sitting down and enjoying their triumph quietly, rather than com-
</p>
<p>mence a new march, with the chance of a second battle, they never-
</p>
<p>theless moved forth to meet Metellus, because he delayed longer
</p>
<p>than they thought he should. The whole passage, therefore, may
</p>
<p>be rendered as follows : '' The Romans, however, though they

<p>abouts.  Ut sese victus gereret. "How he conducted himself
</p>
<p>since his defeat."

<p>6. Numero hominum, &c. " Superior to the, former one in point
</p>
<p>of numbers, but undisciplined and weak, acquainted with husbandry
</p>
<p>and pasturage, rather than with war," i. e. composed of husbandmen
</p>
<p>and herdsmen rather than of soldiers.
</p>
<p>7. Ea gratia. " On the following account." Compare Plautus,

<p>True. Prol. 9, " Sed hoc agamus, hue qua ventumest gratia," i. e.

<p>propter quod : ov %a.oi2/.
</p>
<p>8. Flagitiiiin militiae. '' A disgraceful abandonment of their duty
</p>
<p>as soldiers."  Ita se mores hahent. " Such is their national usage."
</p>
<p>More literally, " so the habits of the nation have themselves." This
</p>
<p>custom of abandoning their general after a defeat is always charac-
</p>
<p>teristic of a semi-barbarous nation, and was of constant occurrence
</p>
<p>among the uncivilized communities of antiquity.
</p>
<p>9. Ferocem. "Unsubdued."  Ex illius luhidine. "According
</p>
<p>to his pleasure." Jugurtha was enabled, by retreating rapidly to
</p>
<p>parts of the country, known to himself, and not to the Romans,
</p>
<p>to give the enemy an opportunity of fighting only when he himself

<p>on jubet. In our reading esse is the historical infinitive.

<p>rarely used in the singular. In early Latinity, plerus,  a,  ztm,

</p>
<p>6. Laeta agere. " Gave loose to jo}^," i. e. agebat laefanegotia,
</p>
<p>equivalent in fact to laeta era^t. The term gaudium denotes prop-
</p>
<p>erly the feeling of joy, or joy of a comparatively moderate kind.
</p>
<p>Laetitia refers to the expression of joy, by words and gestures, and

<p>2. Perfugis. The term perfuga denotes a deserter from our
</p>
<p>enemxies to us, and transfuga, one from us to our enemies. Com-
</p>
<p>pare the remark of Popma : " Transfuga, suos relinquit et ad alios

<p>others who were exposed lo \yild beasts by the younger Afri-canus ;
</p>
<p>and of others whom Paulus Aemilius ordered to be trampled under
</p>
<p>foot by elephants, (2, 7). Hence it follows, that the punishment
</p>
<p>of deserters was left to the pleasm'e of the commander.

<p>6. Fidem viutamssent. " Would have changed sides." Would
</p>
<p>have broken the faith they had pledged to the Romans, after the
</p>
<p>defeat of Jugurtha, and gone over to their former master.
</p>
<p>7. Infensi inteniique. " Full of hostile ardour and on the alert."
</p>
<p>Alii. Opposed to pars. Some editions have evadere alii before
</p>
<p>alii succedere, but this is very properly rejected by others. The
</p>
<p>assailants were only of two classes, those who fought from a dis-
</p>
<p>tance {eminus), and those ^vho advanced to the ramparts {succedere),
</p>
<p>and attempted at one time to undermine, at another ta scale, tJiQ

</p>
<p>1. Pice et sulphur e tacdam mixtam. " Torches besmeared with AQ

<p>and ardentia (" all on fire") is put in the neuter gender as referriuii
</p>
<p>to sudes, pila and taedam, things v\ithout life. The pila had com-
</p>
<p>bustibles attached to them.  The reading we have adopted, is that

<p>of Grater. Cortius, however, gives the following : sudes, pila, prae-

<p>they were his own men." Literally, "his countr3niien."  Statim.
</p>
<p>This adverb is not redundant here as some imagine. Metellus first
</p>
<p>quickly despatched the cavalry, and, immediately after, Marius with
</p>
<p>the allied cohorts.

<p>the cavalry, of the Numidians.  Advorsis equis concurrere, &c.

<p>" Charged straight onward, disordered and broke our line."  Hostis

<p>paene victos dare. After the Numidian cavalry had broken the
</p>
<p>Roman line, they gave the enemy, now almost conquered, into the

<p>the horse. The Romans, it will be perceived, are here again called

</p>
<p>have no singular, or are used in a difierent sense in that number ;
</p>
<p>or else, whose singular is of rare occurrence. Thus, una moenia,
</p>
<p>una castra, unae liter ae, &c. In the present instance the singular
</p>
<p>number of scala is rarely, if ever, met with, and hence the plural
</p>
<p>form is employed. Charisius, Diomedes, and other grammarians,
</p>
<p>maintain that the singular of this w^ord is never used. Compare
</p>
<p>Quintilian, 1, 5, 16 :  " Scala tanien ct scopa, contraque hordea et

<p>the singular of scala : thus, '* Sic hrachiwm deligatum super scalae

<p>174 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>43 1- -^^ imjperandum. The gerund is here used, according to the
</p>
<p>grammarians, in the passive sense, " for the purpose of being or-
</p>
<p>dered," i. e. "of receiving orders." A few other passages ococr,
</p>
<p>in the Latin writers now extant, in which the gerund is similarly
</p>
<p>employed. In the present instance, however, an active meaning,
</p>
<p>though not a very elegant one, may be given to imperandum, " for
</p>
<p>the purpose of an ordering of him on the part of Metellus," i. e.
</p>
<p>"for the purpose of Metellus's ordering him." In this same way,
</p>
<p>perhaps, the other instances may be explained. Thus, Nep. Att. 9,
</p>
<p>" Spes restituendi nulla erat.^^ " There was no hope of his being
</p>
<p>restored," i. e. "of a restoring of him;" and again, Justin, 17, 5,
</p>
<p>" Athenas erudiendi gratia missus.^'' " He was sent to Athens, for
</p>
<p>the sake of being instructed," i. e. for an instructing of himself.
</p>
<p>2. Flectere anhmtm suum. "To change his resolve." To
</p>
<p>waver.
</p>
<p>3. 3Iultis magnisque praesidiis. " Many and great resources "
</p>
<p>Money, horses, arms, elephants.
</p>
<p>4. Numidiam Metello dccreverat. Metellus's consulship havmg
</p>
<p>expired, he was continued in command another year, as proconsul,
</p>
<p>and the province of Numidia was voted to him by the senate. The
</p>
<p>consuls for this year (A. U. C. 646.) were Servius Sulpicius Galba
</p>
<p>and Q. Hortensius, in the place of which latter M. Aurelius
</p>
<p>Scaurus was afterwards chosen.
</p>
<p>5. C. Mario. Marius was a complete slave to superstition, as
</p>
<p>might well be expected in an ignorant and uneducated man. Plu-
</p>
<p>tarch and Frontinus both make mention of a Syrian woman, named
</p>
<p>Martha, whom he carried about with him, and who, as he pretended,
</p>
<p>and very likely believed, was possessed of the gift of prophecy.
</p>
<p>6. Agitahat. " He was meditating."  Cuncta prospera even-
</p>
<p>tiira. The adjective prospera is here used adverbially. Compare
</p>
<p>Catiline, chap. 26. '^Quae occulte ientaverat, aspera foedaque
</p>
<p>evenerant.^^
</p>
<p>7. Praeter vetustatem familiae. " Except antiquity of family."

</p>
<p>manly practices.'' By a course of manly discipline.
</p>
<p>11. Plerisque faciem ejus ignorantihus. The reason of this
</p>
<p>was, because he had been born and brought up out of the city, and

<p>notus. " Being easily recognised by name." At first, no one

</p>
<p>and want of proper education.
</p>
<p>3. Ubi primum, cScc. "As soon as he should be allowed to do

<p>this, by the state of public affaks," i. e. as soon as he, Marius,
</p>
<p>could be spared from the army.
</p>

</p>
<p>5. Annas natus, &:c. As the strictly legal age for obtaining the
</p>
<p>consulship was 43 years, Marius, according to the ironical advice
</p>
<p>of Metellus, would have to wait 23 years longer : and as we may
</p>
<p>suppose Marius to have been, at the time here alluded to, at least
</p>
<p>43 years, (since he entertained thoughts of then standing for ths
</p>
<p>consulship,) he w^ould have to delay his suit until he was 66 years
</p>
<p>old. Compare Plutarch's account of this same matter, at the con-
</p>
<p>clusion of note 3, page 47, of this narrative.

</p>
<p>negotiatores, especially ander the republic, were they who remained
</p>
<p>for some considerable time in one particular place, whether at Re me
</p>
<p>or in the provinces. The mercatorcs, on the contrary, remained a
</p>
<p>Tery short time in any place ; they visited many countries, and
</p>
<p>were almost constantly occupied wdth importing or exporting arti-
</p>
<p>cles of merchandise.

<p>11. Secundum Jieredem. By haeres secundus (next or second
</p>
<p>heir) among the Romans, was meant the individual to whom the
</p>
<p>inheritance descended, if the heir or heirs who were first appointed
</p>
<p>did not choose to accept, or died under the age of puberty.

<p>when he presided in a council of war, or in judgment, or gave audi-
</p>
<p>ence to ambassadors. His lieutenants, or legati, and other persons
</p>
<p>of distinction, took places around him ; and if a king happened to be
</p>
<p>in the army, he sat next to the general on his right hand. The

<p>Romans divided the natural day, or the space from sunrise to sunset,
</p>
<p>into twelve hours, which were of course shorter in winter and longer
</p>
<p>in summer. At the equinoxes, the third haur would exactly coin-
</p>
<p>cide with our ninth. The night was divided into four watches, each
</p>
<p>consisting of three hours, which were likewise of a different length
</p>
<p>at different times of the year. Thus hora sextanoctis, "midnight."
</p>
<p> Septima, " one o'clock in the morning," &c.
</p>
<p>6. Ahnuentis omnia. "Entirely averse to any farther exertion."

</p>
<p>their unwillingness to proceed. This is extremely well indicated by ^g

</p>
<p>The Roman passus, or, "pace," was equal to one yard, 1.85373

</p>
<p>vulgiim, in the accusative, to volgus or vulgus.  Effusum. " That

<p>2. Ex perjidia. "After their treachery."  Poenae cuncta, &c.
</p>
<p>'* Was entirely given up to punishment or plunder." Poenae fuit
</p>
<p>is an unusual form of expression, but does not offend when placed

<p>in the same sentence with the more usual construction fraedae fuit.
</p>
<p>3. Capite poenas solvit. According to Plutarch, Turpilius and

</p>
<p>only himself severe against him, but stirred up most of the other

<p>judges ; so that it was carried against the opinion of Metellus, and
</p>
<p>it was much against his will that he passed upon him sentence of
</p>
<p>death. A short time afterwards, according to Plutarch, the accusa-
</p>
<p>tion appeared a false one, and all the other officers sympathized
</p>
<p>with Metellus, who was overwhelmed with sorrow ; while Marius
</p>
<p>with joy declared that the thing w^as all his own doing, and was not

</p>
<p>Plutarch states, that after this they became more open enemies, and
</p>
<p>that the conversation between Metellus and Marius, of which
</p>
<p>Saiiust makes mention in the 64th chapter of this narrative, took
</p>
<p>place subsequently to this event. According to the biographer, one
</p>
<p>day, when Marius was standing by, Metellus said by way of insult,
</p>
<p>" You are thinkmg, then, my good friend, of leaving us, and going
</p>
<p>home to solicit the consulship : would yc a not be contented to stay,

<p>and be consul v/itb this son of mine]" The son of Metellus, adds

</p>
<p>^T" Plutarch, was then ver}^ young. {Plut. Yit. Mar. c. 8. ed. HvHm,
</p>
<p>vol. 3, p. 68.)
</p>
<p>4. Nam is civis ex Latio erat. It was enacted by the Porcian
</p>
<p>law, that no one should bind, scourge, or kill, a Roman citizen ; and,
</p>
<p>by the Sempronian law, that sentence should not be passed upon the
</p>
<p>life of a Roman citizen without the order of the people. It still
</p>
<p>remains a disputed point whether the operation of these laws was
</p>
<p>suspended or not in the Roman camp. The present passage of
</p>
<p>Sallust goes to prove, that the laws in question were not superseded
</p>
<p>by the military power of the consul, but remained in full force, since
</p>
<p>the words of our author fairly imply that Tui-pilius would not have
</p>
<p>lost his Hfe had he been a citizen of Rome. In the days of Polybius,
</p>
<p>hov/ever, before the period of which Sallust treats, it would appear
</p>
<p>that the punishment of delinquents in the camp was not impeded by
</p>
<p>the laws mentioned above. The subject is discussed by Lipsius,
</p>
<p>(De Mil. Rom. 5. dial. 18,) though without being brought to any
</p>
<p>definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>5. Enm suspiciens. " Suspecting him." An unusual meaning
</p>
<p>for the verb siispicio, which commonly denotes, " to look upward,"
</p>
<p>" to admire," &c. It derives its peculiar force, in the present in-
</p>
<p>stance, from its opposition to suspectics, both suspectus and suspi-
</p>

<p>6. Fatigare animum. " He wearied his invention."  Popularibus

<p>suis. " To his countrymen."  Superaverant. " Had remained
</p>
<p>undone." More literally, "had remained over." To complete the
</p>

</p>
<p>province which V\^as nearest to Numidia, and that he had besides

</p>
<p>^1) the consulship a long time after Marius. Some very erroneously
</p>
<p>refer tempestates in this passage to civil dissentions, contrary to the
</p>
<p>usage of Sallust. Compare Catiline, chapter 53, ^^multis tempers-
</p>
<p>tatibus.''''
</p>
<p>3. Decreverat. " Had decreed this," i. e. the m.anagement of
</p>
<p>this v^ar. Some editions have Numidiam expressed, which is equiva-
</p>
<p>lent. The determination of the consular provinces properly belonged
</p>
<p>to the senate. Sometimes, however, the people, as in the present
</p>
<p>instance, reversed what the senate had decreed respecting the pro-
</p>
<p>vinces. So the attempt of Marius, by means of the tribune Sul-
</p>
<p>picius, to get the command of the war against Mithridates transferred
</p>
<p>from Sylla to himself by the suffrages of the people, gave occasion
</p>
<p>to the first civil war at Rome.
</p>
<p>4. Bocchum. Bocchus was king of Mauritania. Compare chap. 19.
</p>
<p>5. Varius incertusque agitahat. Understand sese. " Was dis-
</p>
<p>tracted by a variety of schemes, and uncertain which to put in ope-
</p>
<p>ration."  Neque illi res^ (Sic. *' Neither any result, nor any plan
</p>
<p>of operations, nor any individual fully pleased him." Res is her
</p>
<p>equivalent to facta, and consilium to facienda.
</p>
<p>6. Quocumque intenderat. Understand animum. *' Whitherso-
</p>
<p>ever he directed his thoughts."
</p>
<p>7. Pro tempore. "As well as the occasion would admit." 
</p>
<p>Ejus milites. These^ words have very much the appearance of a
</p>
<p>useless gloss, though they are given in all the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>8. Tuta simt. For tuita sunt, from tueor. The primitive form
</p>
<p>was tuor, tuitus sum, tui. Compare Catullus, 20, 5. Stat. Achill.

</p>
<p>provided for the educating and rearing of his offspring." Filiorum
</p>
<p>appears to be here used both for sons and daughters. Compare the
</p>
<p>remark of Quintilian, (9, 3,) " Jungit autem et diver sos sexus, ut

</p>
<p>g J pended by the middle with ropes or chains fastened to a beam mat
</p>
<p>lay across two posts, and, hanging thus equally balanced, it was by
</p>
<p>a hundred men, more or less, (who were frequently changed,)
</p>
<p>violently thrust forward, drawn back, again pushed forward, till by
</p>
<p>repeated strokes it had shaken and broken down the wall with its
</p>
<p>iron head. The ram was covered with sheds or mantlets, called
</p>
<p>vineae, which have already been described.
</p>
<p>2. Adjiictas. " Completely ruined." Literally, " dashed to the
</p>
<p>ground."  Prima. " Most valuable." Compare Catiline, chapter
</p>
<p>36.  Eas ijpsi volentes -pcpendere. *' This (punishment) they suf-
</p>
<p>fered voluntarily from their own hands." Literally, " these (atone-
</p>
<p>ments) they of themselves voluntarily paid." They had nothing to
</p>
<p>expect from the Roman commander, in case they fell into his hands,
</p>
<p>but the crudest punishment.
</p>
<p>3. Pariter curn capta Thala. The same as Eodem tempore quo
</p>
<p>Thala capta fuit.  Pracfcctumque. "And governor."  Ni id
</p>
<p>festinaret. " That unless he should hasten to do this," i. e. to
</p>
<p>afford them aid.
</p>
<p>4. Snam salutern, &c. Blorum in this passage refers to the
</p>
<p>Romans, and it is the same as if Sallust had said, suam^ qui
</p>
<p>illorum socii essent, salutern. The passage may hence be para-
</p>
<p>phrased as follows : " they, the allies of the Romans, would be
</p>
<p>involved in the greatest danger." Or, we may render more literally,
</p>
<p>though less in accordance vxdth the English idiom, " their safety,
</p>
<p>who were the allies of the Romans, would be in the greatest danger."
</p>
<p>5. Navi fecerant. *' They had executed with promptness." The
</p>
<p>more usual form, and, we may add, the earlier one, w^ould seem to
</p>
<p>have been gnavus, not navus. The term appears to be derived
</p>
<p>from, or analogous to, the Greek yewaXog, by contraction yvaXoq, and
</p>
<p>with the insertion of the digamma, dropping at the same time the ly
</p>
<p>we have yvoFog, in Latin gnavus.

</p>
<p>to be dependant here on jussit. The simpler construction, however,
</p>
<p>would be jussit Numidiam esse provinciam ei.
</p>
<p>11. Multus atque ferox instare. " Was frequent and violent in
</p>
<p>his attacks on that order." The adjectives multus and ferox are
</p>
<p>here elegantly employed instead of the adverbs multum and
</p>
<p>fcrociiei'.

</p>
<p>Plutarch : " He (Marius) scrupled not to say, that he had taken the

</p>
<p>and the rich."

</p>
<p>with hiiu." Veterans, who were exempt from any farther miUtary
</p>
<p>duty, were sometimes induced to serve again by special request
</p>
<p>from a commander. If they did so, they were freed from all the
</p>
<p>drudgery of the camp, such as going for water, wood, forage, stand-
</p>
<p>ing guard, &c. and were generally marshalled by themselves under
</p>
<p>a standard of their own. The military age with the Romans began
</p>
<p>at seventeen, and ended generally with the forty-fifth year, after
</p>
<p>v/hich period they were exempt, and only served if they pleased, as
</p>
<p>has just been stated. They were then called emeriti strpendiis,

<p>We have here an imitation of the Greek construction alluded to in

</p>
<p>mans, than is generally supposed."
</p>
<p>11. Ad hoc. From this to the end of the sentence, nam alia
</p>
<p>irfirma sunt, Marius seeks to show, how absolutely necessary it is
</p>
<p>for him to be possessed of integrity and principle, since he wants
</p>
<p>all those adventitious aids on which the nobility rely for impunity

<p>in their guilty career.  Nam alia injirma sunt. " For my other

<p>show w^hy he must labour strenuously ^nd faithfully in his new

</p>
<p>and disappoint the expectations of the bad.
</p>

<p>14. Invadcndi. " Of attack." Some understand me, it is better,
</p>
<p>however, to take the verb here absolutely, without any special
</p>
<p>reference to a case. The nobility may be considered, according to
</p>
<p>the idea of Marius, as watching for an opportunity of attacking both
</p>
<p>the commons and himself.

<p>of a still stronger meaning : *' Basely to abandon."

</p>
<p>dered as follows : " For the discharge of the duties of the consul-
</p>
<p>ship, though posterior, in point of time, to the being elected consul,
</p>
<p>is in reality prior to it, as regards the truth itself and the advantages
</p>
<p>resulting to the state." The idea intended to be conveyed is this :
</p>
<p>In strictness of language, no one can be said to hold a station, the
</p>
<p>consulship, for example, until he is appointed to it by the suffrages
</p>
<p>of the people. And yet, if we take into consideration the faithful
</p>
<p>discharge of official duties, and the advantages thence resulting to
</p>
<p>the state, we must admit that qualifications and experience are prior
</p>
<p>in the scale of importance to the mere formal appointment to office.
</p>
<p>In a word, they alone are true consuls, who are qualified to dis-
</p>
<p>charge correctly the duties of the consulship, when they present
</p>
<p>themselves before the people as candidates for that high station ;
</p>
<p>and the administration of such men only will prove beneficial to the
</p>
<p>state.

</p>
<p>of the poet, " Virtue alone is true nobility."

<p>bravery bestowed by the Roman com.manders on such as had dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished themselves. The hasta was a spear, without any iron
</p>
<p>head, and hence called hasia pura. The vexillum was a streamer
</p>
<p>on the end of a lance or spear, of different colours, with or without
</p>
<p>embroidery. The phalerae were trappings, or ornaments for horses,

</p>
<p>Romans. " Marius," observes Plutarch, " neither learned to read
</p>
<p>Greek, nor would ever make use of that language upon any serious
</p>
<p>occasion : thinking it ridiculous to bestow time on le-arning a
</p>
<p>language of which the teachers were slaves. And when, after his
</p>
<p>second triumph, at the dedication of a temple, he exhibited shows
</p>
<p>to the people in the Grecian manner, he barely entered the theatre
</p>
<p>and sat down, and then immediately departed." Plutarch justly
</p>
<p>ascribes, to this neglect of the softening qualities of literary pursuits,
</p>
<p>he excesses w^hicli stained the character of Marius.

<p>Cortius : '' Praesidium agitare nihil aliud est quam praesidio esse,
</p>
<p>vel frwmentayitihis, vel impedimentis, vel urbi oppugnatae.''''

<p>gg 1. Neque illos arte colam, &c. "Nor will I treat them with
</p>
<p>severity of discipHne, myself with indulgence."
</p>
<p>2. Hoc est utile, &c. " This is an exercise of authority produc-
</p>
<p>tive of benefit to the state ; this, such as one citizen should put in
</p>
<p>practice towards another." In explanation of the peculiar meaning
</p>
<p>of civile in this passage, compare Livy 6. 40 :  " Sermo est minime
</p>
<p>civilis ;" and Crevier's note :  " Sermo est qui minime deceat cives
</p>
<p>memores se cum civibus agere, qui pari jure lihertatis fruuntur, in
</p>
<p>quos minime liceat imperioso genere sermonis uti^
</p>
<p>3. Tute. The pronoun. " When you yourself live in luxurious
</p>

<p>by severity of punishment, this is to be a tyrant, not a commander "

</p>
<p>ment with little elegance, and keep no buffoon nor cook of higher
</p>
<p>price than my steward : charges which T am perfectly willing to ad-

</p>
<p>amusement of the company, is a general appellation, among other
</p>
<p>Roman writers, for an actor. Livy makes the word of Etrurian

<p>origin :  " Quia hister Tusco verho ludio vocabatur, nomen histrioni-

<p>man people were divided into six classes, according to the valuation

<p>of their property. The richest were placed in the iii'st class, from
</p>
<p>which there was a regular progression, as respected wealth and dig-
</p>
<p>nity, down to the lowest or sixth class. The members of this class
</p>
<p>formed the great bulk of poorer citizens, and w^ere denomuiated
</p>
<p>capite censi, from having no fortune, but being " rated by the
</p>
<p>head." At first, none of the lowest class w^ere enlisted as soldiers,

<p>except in dangerous emergencies. The alteration introduced by

</p>
<p>subsequent career of this nobleman.

</p>
<p>which had surrendered to the Roman arms, and were now regarded
</p>
<p>as a kind of allies.
</p>
<p>4. Armis exuerat. " Had stripped of his arms," i. e. had com-
</p>
<p>pelled to fly with the loss of his arms.
</p>
<p>5. Belli pair audi. '' Calculated to bring the war to a close."
</p>
<p>Scheller and other grammarians would here understand negotia esse^
</p>
<p>making negotia govern the genitive belli patrandi expressed. The
</p>
<p>simpler way, however, would be merely to understand esse, in the
</p>
<p>sense of belonging to, appertaining to, &c. and let the genitive belli
</p>
<p>depend upon this verb.

<p>silent, however, respecting a Libyan Hercules, unless the one whom
</p>
<p>he mentions second in order, as born of the Nile, and surnamed
</p>
<p>Aegyptius, be the same. In truth, however, the history of Hercules
</p>
<p>is a mere fable. Hercules is the sun, and his twelve labours have
</p>
<p>a direct reference to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Creuzer has
</p>
<p>discovered some very striking points of resemblance between Her-

<p>cules, Djemschid, Mithras, and Osiris.

<p>describes the contest between the army of Regulus and a monstroua

<p>serpent, near the river Bagradas.

</p>
<p>cants qui agebant (scil. vitam). Cortius reads qui and age-

<p>6. Salem. Sal is found in the singular as a neuter also. The

</p>
<p>" that he, pillaging the country, (i. e. at present,) w^ill come there
</p>
<p>after a few days." Understand dkit. The form in bundiis has the
</p>
<p>general force of a present participle, with the meaning somewhat
</p>
<p>strengthened. Pracdabundus here denotes an active system of

<p>pillage.

<p>AO the remarks of Cortms, {ad loc.) and Perizonms, (ad Sanctii Mm.
</p>
<p>1, 15). Still, however, the whole clause is very suspicious. If
</p>
<p>coercitum be taken as the simple participle of the passive voice,
</p>
<p>with the preteritive meaning (" kept in subjection,") it may well be
</p>
<p>asked, when had the inhabitants of the place proved faithless to the

<p>E^omans 1 If, on the other hand, coercitum be taken for coercenduin,
</p>
<p>the Capsensians are punished on anticipation merely ! For the

<p>Romans as yet know nothing about them. The only v/ay to obviate

<p>the difEcuity, is by supposing that the allusion in genus hominunii

<p>Bipont edition, which has the authority of some manuscripts in its

<p>favour. Cortius and many subsequent editors read, Omnia 7ion bene

</p>
<p>had learned the art of war by practice and example, and d'splayed their

</p>
<p>3. Pauco munimentOy &c. The singular of paucns is of rare
</p>
<p>occurrence. We meet with it in Horace, {A. P. 203,) ^^ for amine
</p>
<p>^awco," and in Aulus Gellius, (20, 1,) ^^ injurias pauco acre diluere.^^
</p>
<p>Cortius reads, pauca munimento quaerehat.
</p>
<p>4. Agitare. "To patrol." Better than agitare noctem^ "to pass
</p>
<p>the night," as some render it. Noctem is " during the night."
</p>
<p>5. Pleno gradu. x'Vccording to Vegetius, (1, 9,) the ordinary step
</p>
<p>was at the rate of twenty miles in five hours, the quick step, {plenus
</p>
<p>gradusy) twenty-four miles in the same time.

<p>C. Efusi. "Without any regular order." Equivalent to nullo g*^
</p>
<p>scrvato ordine.
</p>
<p>7. Ipsi duces. Jugurthaand Bocchus.  Feroces. " Highly elated."
</p>
<p>8. Uti per vigilias solebant. It was customary at the end of each
</p>
<p>watch to sound the trumpets, in order to call out those who were to
</p>
<p>stand guard in turn.
</p>
<p>9. Ita. " To such a degree."  Strepitu, clamore. " By reason
</p>
<p>of the uproar, the shouting."
</p>
<p>1. Li hiberna. Supply proficiscitur. A similar ellipsis occurs in

<p>tisque admodum copiis^ in eumdem versus oceanum.'^ Understand it.
</p>
<p>2. Quadrraio agmine. The agmen quadratum of the Romans
</p>
<p>was a right-angled parallelogram, not a square. Quddrato agmine
</p>
<p>may therefore be rendered, " with his army in column." Compare
</p>
<p>the words of Salmasius, {de Re Mil. Rom., c. 10, p. 103, edit.
</p>
<p>Ludg. 1657,) " Quadratum agmen noii dicitur, cujus latitudo
</p>

</p>
<p>recta linca exaequatam et ad extremitate^ angulos rectos.''' So also
</p>
<p>Guischard, {Memoir es crit. et histor. sur les antiquites militaires,
</p>
<p>vol. 1, p. 195,) ^^ La figure ressembloit a une parallelogramrae
</p>
<p>quelconque a angles droits.'^
</p>
<p>3. Apud dextumos. " On the extreme right."  Praeterea cohortes
</p>
<p>Ligurum curabat. " Had charge also of the cohorts of the Ligu-
</p>
<p>rians".  Manldus is the nominative to curabat. The meaning is, that
</p>
<p>Manlius, besides the slingers and archers, commanded also the
</p>
<p>Ligurians.  Primos et extremos. " In the front and rear."
</p>
<p>4. Minume cari. " Whose lives were least valued."  Quasi
</p>
<p>nullo imposito. " As if no one w^ere placed over them by him,"
</p>
<p>i. e. as if no share of the command were committed to any other.

</p>
<p>diffidentia futuri ejus omnis quae, &;c., m.aking quae plural, on

<p>gg 7. Uti militibus, &c. '' That their toils, being shared by their
</p>
<p>commander, might be cheerfully endured by the soldiers at large."
</p>
<p>We have here another instance of the Greek construction, ex-
</p>
<p>plained m note 3, page 55.
</p>
<p>8. Malo. " By punishment."  Per amhitionem. "From a de-
</p>
<p>sire for popularity."  A pueritia consuetam duritiam, " Hardships
</p>
<p>become familiar from boyhood."
</p>
<p>9. Nisi ta7ne7i, &c. " And yet, however, the affairs of the state
</p>
<p>were managed with as much success and dignity, as if his authority
</p>
<p>had been exercised in the most rigorous manner." Nisi tamen is
</p>
<p>here equivalent to sed tamen, and the meaning intended to be con-
</p>
<p>veyed, is : " But, whether he acted from ambitious motives, or from
</p>
<p>being himself accustomed to hardships, still one thing is certain, that
</p>
<p>the affairs of the state were managed," &c. Compare chapter 24,

<p>10. Citi. " Advancing at full speed."  Divorsi. " From dif-
</p>
<p>ferent quarters."  Advorsum omnia paratus. His troops being
</p>
<p>arranged in the agmen quadratum.
</p>
<p>11. Utique. We have adopted the conjectural emenaation of
</p>
<p>Gronovius, in place of aeque as given by Cortius. The meaning
</p>
<p>of the whole clause will be, " having supposed, that, out of the whole
</p>
<p>number, some certainly, no matter v/ho, would come in the rear of
</p>
<p>the enemy." (Compare Quarterly Journal of Education, No. 3,
</p>
<p>p. 151.) Cortius refers aeque to ah iergo, and translates it, ^^ gerade
</p>
<p>von hintc7i zu,^"* " directly in the rear." The Bipont editor explains
</p>
<p>aeque as follows : *' Hx quadruplici agmine certe unum, quodcunqne

<p>essety This explanation suits, hov^/ever, utique much better than
</p>
<p>aeque.
</p>
<p>12. Quern primum adtigerant. " With whom they first came in

<p>contact."  Caeteri. Referring to the rest of the cavalry under his

<p>" We sometimes find," observes Scheller, " a plural verb after a
</p>
<p>single subject or person, which, however, is united to another subject
</p>
<p>by cum, since they are there regarded as two subjects or nomina-
</p>
<p>tives." (L. G. vol. 1, p. 334.) Compare Catiline, (chap. 43,
</p>
<p>Lentulus cum ceteris cons tituer ant.
</p>
<p>2. Apud primos. " In the front," i. e. apud eos quos primos
</p>
<p>>ollocaverat.  Numida. Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>3. Ad pedites. It is a matter of some doubt among commen-
</p>
<p>tators, whether the infantry here meant are the Roman, or those
</p>
<p>which '^^olux had brought and with which Bocchus had attacked the
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR. 203
</p>
<p>Roman rear. It is more than probable that the former are alluded QQ
</p>
<p>to, especially as'the words ibi Latine follow. Cortius, however,
</p>
<p>is in favour of the opposite opinion.
</p>
<p>4. Satis impigre. *' AVith great quickness," i. e. vv^th so much
</p>
<p>celerity as to have escaped the observation of the Romans around.
</p>
<p>Some, hovvever, render it " with great bravery." This is certainly
</p>
<p>inferior.
</p>
<p>5. Atrocitate rei. _" Yv'ith the dreadful nature of the thing."
</p>
<p>The meaning intended to be conveyed is this : The Romans were
</p>
<p>throwm into alarm, not so much from any confidence which they
</p>
<p>placed in the words of Jucrurtha, as from the reflection, that there
</p>
<p>w^as indeed a possibility of their favourite commander's losing his
</p>
<p>life in the action.
</p>
<p>6. Adeptam. Used passively, adipiscor being a common, not a
</p>
<p>deponent, verb.  Vitahiindus. '* After making the most vigorous
</p>
<p>exertions to escape." Or, it may be rendered generally, '^ by a
</p>
<p>desperate effort." Consult note 10, page 61.
</p>
<p>7. Sequi, &c. A beautiful specimen of the figure Asyndeton,
</p>
<p>in imitation, ver}^ probably, of the celebrated passage in Xenophon,
</p>
<p>{Ages. 2, 12,) praised by Longinus, <5 19. TiVniSaXovre^ rag darrtSag,
</p>
<p>IwBovvrn^ endyovTO, drreKrecvou^ drtiBwiTKOv.
</p>
<p>8. Niti modo. Supply surgere. " They merely made an effort
</p>
<p>to rise."  Qua visits erat. " xAlS far as the eye could reach."
</p>
<p>Visus is a noun of the fourth declension, and the clause, rendered
</p>
<p>literally, is, " where there was a view."
</p>
<p>9. Postea loci. For the simple postea.
</p>
<p>10. Post diem quintum, quam, &:c. "On the fifth day after the
</p>
<p>barbarians had met with their second defeat." The Latin language
</p>
<p>admits several variations of this construction. Thus we may either
</p>
<p>adopt the form used in the text, or quinto die postquam pugnaverant,
</p>
<p>or quinqiie dichus postquam pugnaverant, or post dies quintos quam
</p>
<p>pug7iavera7it ; or with the ablative alone, omitting post, die quinto
</p>
<p>quam pugnaverant. Tlie anomalous appearance of post diem
</p>
<p>quintum quam, &c., and some other of the phrases just quoted,

</p>
<p>arose, according to Zumpt, from a transposing of the preposition.
</p>
<p>Having once written post die quinto quam, they would be easily
</p>
<p>led to change die quinto into diein quintum, as if it had been
</p>
<p>governed by post.
</p>
<p>11. Cum is. An archaism for cum iis.  Acciti. " Having been
</p>
<p>invited," i. e. on an invitation from the king.
</p>
<p>1. Cujus facundiae, &c. Manlius gave precedence to Sylk, 'J'Q
</p>
<p>although he was younger than himself, on account of his superior
</p>
<p>ability in speaking.

<p>3. Persequi. A Hellenism, for persequendi. Compare Scheller,
</p>
<p>L. G. vol. 2, p. 202. Veckneri Hellenolex, p. 285.
</p>
<p>4. Principio. Cortius reads jam inopi msum, omitting a prin"
</p>
<p>cipio reipuUicae. The remark of ^the Bipont editor on this emenda*
</p>
<p>tion is perfectly conclusive : " Sed inopum non foret, quaerere
</p>
<p>servos populos ; neque its facile, amicos invenire, nedum, quod ea

</p>
<p>valent to in eodem honoris et gratiae loco apud nos eris.
</p>
<p>6. Par elites. " Subjects."
</p>
<p>7. Cui scilicet placuit, &c. We have here given the reading of
</p>
<p>the Bipont edition, which is based in part upon that of the Aldine.
</p>
<p>Cortius has placuisse, and makes the infinitive depend on scilicet
</p>
<p>(i. e. scire licet).
</p>
<p>3. Officiis. " By future services."
</p>
<p>9. Pro delicto. *' In extenuation of his misconduct."
</p>
<p>10. Expulerit. Understand ipse, i. e. Bocchus. The monarch
</p>
<p>here utters an intentional falsehood, in asserting that he had driven
</p>
<p>Jugurtha from this part of Numidia. His object in making this bold
</p>
<p>assertion would seem to have been, to ingratiate himself with the
</p>
<p>Romans, and to show his pretended hostility towards Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>Cortius reads expulcrat, and refers it to Marius ; making the clause
</p>
<p>jure belli suam factam relate to Bocchus.

<p>11. Copia facta. " When an opportunity of sending thern was

<p>the region w^here the turris regia was situated. Cortius reads
</p>
<p>infecto, quo intenderat, 7iegotio, and makes it equivalent to infecto
</p>
<p>7iegotio, quo confecto redire intenderat. This is altogether inferior
</p>
<p>to the lection which we have adopted.

<p>decernunt. " Decide in favour of a harsher course."  Mutant.

<p>206 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>^"2 h^^ i^ efficiehant, that is, the verb has two meanings, to suit
</p>
<p>our idiom, one for each clause. " Caused the number to appear
</p>
<p>greater than the reality to Sylla and the rest of his party, and gave
</p>
<p>rise to apprehensions as of the approach of an enemy."
</p>
<p>7. Ezpedire. " Got ready for battle." We may understand ai
</p>
<p>pugnam, which is expressed in Livy, (38, 21,) " Quos ubi Romani
</p>
<p>viderunt, expediunt sese ad pugnam.''''
</p>
<p>8. Tentare. " Each tried."  Intendere. This is commonly
</p>
<p>rendered, " they bent their bows," with an ellipsis of arcus. Such
</p>
<p>an interpretation, however, is decidedly pleonastic, snice arma atque
</p>
<p>tela tentare precedes. The true meaning is, *' directed his whole
</p>
<p>attention to the approaching engagement." Understand animum.
</p>
<p>9. Rem, uti erat, 6z:c. " Bring back word, as was actually the
</p>
<p>case, that all was peaceful," i, e. that there was nothing to fear.
</p>
<p>10. Ohviam illis simul, et praesidio. ^' Both to receive them,
</p>
<p>and to act as an escort." Literally, " both to meet them, and for a
</p>
<p>guard."
</p>
<p>11. hicerto voltii. " With a troubled look."
</p>
<p>12. Animo feroci. *' With stern resolution."  Cert a pestis
</p>
<p>*' Certain destruction."  Ah eodem. Referring to Volux.
</p>
<p>13. Coenatos esse. "To have their evening repast over." Some
</p>
<p>neuter verbs have participles which are passive in form, but active
</p>
<p>in meaning ; as coenatus, " one who has supped ;" pransus, *' one
</p>
<p>who has dined ;" juratus, " one who has sworn," &c. The Roman
</p>
<p>soldiers took food twice a day, at dinner and at supper. The former
</p>
<p>was a slight meal, which they commonly took standing. They
</p>
<p>indulged themselves a httle more at supper.
</p>
<p>14. Prima vigilia. The Romans, as has been observed in a
</p>
<p>previous note, divided the night into four watches of three hours
</p>
<p>each. The first watch commenced at sunset.
</p>
<p>>J'Q 1. Ante. " In advance of them."
</p>
<p>2. Manu vindicandum. " That immediate vengeance ought to
</p>
<p>be taken." That he ought to be punished in a summary manner.

<p>openly, while he himself, (Volux,) the son, was present as a witness

<p>of his conduct."

<p>7. Per media ejus castra. Cortius thinks the meaning would be

<p>improved if media were omitted, and -prae rendered by praeter. We
</p>
<p>cannot agree with him. Volux had stated, that Jugurtha w^ould not
</p>
<p>dare to do any thing openly if he were present : in confirmation of
</p>
<p>this, he proposes that they march boldly through his very encamp-
</p>
<p>ment. Jugurtha probably had encamped his forces in two divisions,
</p>
<p>or else in scattered order.

<p>ever, successfully defends the lection we have given in the text, and
</p>
<p>makes it signify "they had come ;" for accido frequently has tliis
</p>
<p>meaning when any person or thing chances to arrive unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>Compare Livy, (32, 30,) " Civitati fama incerta accidit ;^^ and
</p>
<p>Quintus Curtius, (4, 4, 6,) " Alexander class era litori, e quo fremitus
</p>
<p>acciderat, admovit.'' So also Tacitus, {Hist. 4, 29, 4,) Uride
</p>
<p>clamor acciderat ;" and our own author, chapter SS of this narrative,
</p>
<p>*' quo iviprovisus gravior acciderety
</p>
<p>9. Orator. "As his ambassador," or "agent." Compare
</p>
<p>Livy, (30, 16,) ^^ Jam nullo auctore belli ultra audito, oratores ad
</p>
<p>pacem pctendam mittunty Observe also the change of construc-
</p>
<p>tion in our author, '^ praemissus orator^ et (praemissus) specu-
</p>
<p>latumy

<p>10. Quern Bocchus, (Sec. Cortius inserts Romanis dStex jidum ,
</p>
<p>but Bocchus had not been long acquainted with the Romans, and,
</p>
<p>therefore, fidum Romanis seems too harsh. Fidum here means
</p>
<p>simply, "worthy of reliance.''
</p>
<p>11. Consulta sese om7iia., &c. "That he was keeping every
</p>

</p>
<p>their common consideration.
</p>
<p>1. Neu Jugurthae legatum pertimesceret, &c. The true read- 74
</p>
<p>ing here is extremely doubtful. Some have accitum esse quo res,
</p>
<p>&:c. Others cautum esse. Cortius places a semicolon after perti-
</p>
<p>mesceret, and makes quo res communis, &;c., follow immediately
</p>
<p>after, without either accitum esse or cautum esse. As accitum esse
</p>
<p>is wanting in most of the manuscripts, we have adopted the conjec-
</p>
<p>ture of Gronovius, by which quo is changed into quin^ and the
</p>
<p>meaning of the passage then becomes, " Nor should he be disquieted
</p>
<p>at the presence of Jugurtha's ambassador, lest, in consequence of

</p>
<p>'J'^ this, their common business might be carried on with less freedom
</p>
<p>than otherwise."
</p>
<p>2. Nam ab insidiis ejus, &c. Bocchus means, that he has been
</p>
<p>compelled to allow Jugurtha to have an ambassador at his court,
</p>
<p>since otherwise that monarch would have been constantly annoying
</p>
<p>him by his intrigues ; whereas the presence of his ambassador
</p>
<p>would lead Jugurtha to think, that no scheme could be formed by
</p>
<p>Bocchus, unfriendly to his (Jugurtha's) interests, without that am-
</p>
<p>bassador's perceiving it, and hence the suspicions of the Numidian
</p>
<p>monarch would not be so constantly excited.
</p>
<p>3. Punica fide. " With a treacherous intent." The Roman
</p>
<p>writers used the expression Punica fides to denote bad faith, in
</p>
<p>allusion t- the frequent violation of compacts which were charged
</p>
<p>against t) e Carthaginians by their haughty rivals. The Carthaginians
</p>
<p>might ha /e returned the compliment without any great violation of
</p>
<p>the truth. Attica fides was a proverbial expression, on the othei
</p>
<p>hand, to indicate good faith. Compare Velleius Patercuius,
</p>
<p>(2, 23, 4,) " Adeo eyiim certa Atheniensmvi hi Romanos fides fuitj
</p>
<p>ut semper, et in omni re, quidquid sincerafide gcreretur, id Romam
</p>
<p>Attica fieri praedicarenty Some writers extend this character for
</p>
<p>good faith to the whole nation, and make Graeca fides and Attica
</p>
<p>fides synonymous. This is altogether incorrect. The true expla-
</p>
<p>nation is given by Junius, {Adagia Veterum, j.. 577,) " Graeca
</p>
<p>fides pro dubia et tana accipitur, haud pro certa : quippe quae nulla
</p>

</p>
<p>gurtha's envoy.
</p>
<p>7. In sua castra. The reference here is to Sylla and Bocchus-,
</p>
<p>not to Sylla and Aspar as Cortius maintains. " Sulla,"' observes
</p>
<p>Burnouf, '' quamvis po.ucos milites haberet, eos videlicet alicubi

</p>
<p>quum bellum gereret, cur non et ipse castra in proprio regno ha-
</p>

</p>
<p>the very next day was still at the court of Bocchus, which could not

</p>
<p>8. Internuncius. "As a mutual adviser.''  Sanctus vir, &c.
</p>
<p>"A man of strict integrity, pnd acceptable to both parties." The
</p>
<p>common text has ex sententia jurat amhohus. " And who swears as

<p>1. Egrediar. In the sense of transgrediar. Some verbs, com- 7'5
</p>
<p>pounded of prepositions that govern an ablative, take an accusative.
</p>
<p>Thus, besides the example in the text, we have in Livy, egredi urbem,

<p>the countenance, in short, any thing indicative of the will {vultus a

<p>that, although the capture of Jugurtha procured Marius a triumph,
</p>
<p>yet envy ascribed the whole glory of it to Sylla. This Marius in his
</p>
<p>heart not a little resented, adds the biographer, especially when he
</p>
<p>found that Sylla, who was naturally fond of fame, and from a low
</p>
<p>and obscure condition now rose to general esteem, suffered his am-
</p>
<p>bition to carr}^ him so far as to order a signet to be engraved with a

<p>representation of the capture of Jugurtha. This he constantly used
</p>
<p>in sealing his letters. The device was, Bocchus delivering up
</p>
<p>Jugurtha, and Sylla receiving him.
</p>
<p>10. Gallos. More correctly Germanos, for they were the Cim
</p>
<p>bri, Teutones, and Tigurini. Compare Florus, (3, 3,) *' Cimbri^
</p>
<p>Theutoni atque Tigurini, ab extremis Galliae profugi, quum terras

<p>12. Cum GalliSf &c. Compare Cicero, {Off. 1, 12,) " Cum
</p>
<p>Cimbris, vt cum inimicis, gerehatur; uter essety non uter imperaret.^^
</p>
<p>13. Jugurtkam, vinctum, &c. It may not be improper to add a
</p>
<p>few words relative to the fate of Jugurtha. " It is said," observes
</p>
<p>Plutarch, " that when he was led before the car of the conqueror,
</p>
<p>he lost his senses. After the triumph, he was thrown into prison,
</p>
<p>where, while they were in haste to strip him, some tore his robe off
</p>
<p>his back, and others, catching eagerly at his pendants, pulled off
</p>
<p>the tips of his ears along with them. When he was thrust down
</p>
<p>naked into the dungeon, all confused, he said with a frantic smile,
</p>
<p>" Heavens ! how cold is this bath of yours !" There, having strug-
</p>
<p>gled, for six days, with extreme hunger, and to the last hour labour-
</p>
<p>ing for the preservation of life, he came to such an end as his crimes
</p>
<p>deserved. There were carried (we are told) in his triumph, three
</p>
<p>thousand and seven pounds of gold, five thousand, seven hundred
</p>
<p>and seventy-five of silver bullion, and of silver coin, seventeen thou
</p>
<p>sand and twenty-eight drachmas."
</p>
<p>14. Ahscns. "Though absent." This was a violation of the law,
</p>
<p>since no person, strictly speaking, was allowed to stand candidate
</p>
<p>for the consulship, unless present at the time in Rome. The con-
</p>
<p>dition, however, was often violated.
</p>
<p>15. Kalendis Januariis. The first of Janiiar}% the day when
</p>
<p>the new consuls were inducted into office. Consult note 13,
</p>
<p>page 105. After the solemnity of the triumph was finished, Marius,
</p>
<p>as Plutarch informs us, assembled the senate in the capitol, where,
</p>
<p>either through inadvertence, or gross insolence, he entered in his
</p>
<p>triumphal robes ; but soon perceiving that the sejiate was offended,
</p>
<p>he went and put on his ordinary habit, and then retui'ned to his
</p>
<p>place.

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE.
</p>
<p>Page
</p>
<p>1. Omnis. For cmnes. The old form. {Jygurl/ia, note 9, 'Jl)
</p>
<p>page 1,).  Sese student praesf are. The insertion of the pronoun
</p>
<p>here is not a pleonasm, as some maintahi, but in reality the older
</p>
<p>and fuller forrh of expression, and may be regarded as equivalent to
</p>
<p>ut ipsi jyracstent. Instances occur in other wTiters also. Thus,
</p>
<p>, Cicero, {Off. 2. 20.) '' G-ratum se videri studct.'^ So also after
</p>
<p>cupcre, velle, and malk.
</p>
<p>2. Silentio. " In obscurit}\" The silejice which the rest of man-
</p>
<p>kind preserve re-specting us, when we have done nothing to render
</p>
<p>our names illustrious.
</p>
<p>3. Prona. " Stooping downward to the earth." Compare Ovid
</p>
<p>(Met. 1, 84,) " Pronaque qman spcctent animalia caetera terram.^^
</p>
<p>4. Aiiimi imperio, &.c. " We use more the empire of the mind, the
</p>
<p>obedience of the body," Sallust wishes to convey the idea, that it
</p>
<p>is the province of the mind to conmiand, of the body to obey. Some
</p>
<p>very erroneously make imperio depend for its government on the
</p>
<p>comparative magis. " We make more use of the empiie of the
</p>
<p>mind, than of the obedience of the body."
</p>
<p>5. Quo. " On which account."  Rectius. ^' More consistent
</p>
<p>with reason."  Opihus. " By the resources."
</p>
<p>6. Memoriam nostri. " The remembrance of ourselves." Me-
</p>
<p>moriam nostram would mean " our faculty of memory."
</p>
<p>7. Hahetur. The force of this verb, in the present passage, 'jb
</p>
<p>best seen by a paraphrase : " The endowments of mind form tl e
</p>
<p>only illustrious and lasting possession."
</p>
<p>8. Sed. Elegantly uaed in the sense of continuation, like oV
</p>
<p>in Greek, and to be rendered " Now^"  Vine corpoi'is, &c.
</p>
<p>*' ^\llethe^ a warlike enterprise depended more for its success on
</p>
<p>strength of body, or energ)^ of mind." Literally, " whether a war-
</p>
<p>like operation proceeded more from strength of body," &c.
</p>
<p>9. Consulto " Of deliberation."  Mature facto. " Of speedy

<p>execution," i. e. in proper season. The participles consulto and
</p>
<p>216 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page. \
</p>
<p>'JQ facto are here elegantly used in place of noiins. The literal trans-
</p>
<p>lation v/ould be, " of a thing's being deliberated uponj" and " of its
</p>
<p>being performed in {)ropcr seasori."
</p>
<p>10. Imperii. " Of authority."  Diversi. "Differing in their views."
</p>
<p> Agitabatur. The frequentative for the simple verb, as in Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>11. Cyrus. The elder of the name.
</p>
<p>12. Lubidinem dominandi. *' A lust of dominion."  Maxumam
</p>
<p>gloriam. Understand sitam esse, or something equivalent.
</p>
<p>13. Periculo atque negotiis. " From actual experience, and
</p>
<p>from affairs themselves," i. e. from the experience which affairs
</p>
<p>themselves bestowed.
</p>
<p>go 1. Quod si regum, &:c. "But if the mental qualities of kings
</p>
<p>and of those who command were exercised to the same degree in
</p>
<p>peace that they are in war."  Aequabihus atque constantius, &c.
</p>
<p>*' Human affairs would proceed with more regularity and steadi-
</p>
<p>ness." This usage of the verb habeo with the pronoun is analo-
</p>
<p>gous to the Greek idiom : ev l^'ct *' he is well," i. e. sv sx^'- C^ci'^tov)
</p>
<p>"he has himself well." (Compare Vigefs Greek Idioms, p. 84.
</p>
<p>Seager''s trans I.)
</p>
<p>2. Aliud alio, &c. Alius, as has already been remarked in the
</p>
<p>Notes to the Jugurthine War, is frequently used by Sallust, and
</p>
<p>also by the best writers, with one of its own cases, or an adverb
</p>
<p>derived from it, to denote what in English requires two separate
</p>
<p>expressions. Thus we may render the passage in the text, " neither
</p>
<p>would you behold one thing carried in one direction, another in
</p>
<p>another," &c.  Artibus. "Means."
</p>
<p>3. Pro laborc. " In the stead of active exertion." Labor has
</p>
<p>here a special reference to military operations.  Pro continentia et
</p>
<p>aequiiate, &c. " In the stead of moderation and a regard for natu-
</p>
<p>ral equality, cupidity, and a tyrannical spirit," &c. As Sallust here
</p>
<p>contrasts virtues and vices, continentia will be opposed to lubido,
</p>
<p>and aequitas to superbia ; which removes, we conceive, all diffi-
</p>
<p>culty as to the meaning of the individual terms. Burnouf makes

</p>
<p>lubido in this passage signify " caprice," an opinion in which wo
</p>
<p>cannot concur.  Fortuna. Understand principum.
</p>
<p>4. Optumwm quemque. " The most deserving." Literally
</p>
<p>" each most deserving person."  Arant, &c. Equivalent to arando,
</p>
<p>navigando, aedificando efficiunt : hence quae homines arant, &c.,
</p>
<p>may be rendered by nouns, " agriculture, navigation, architecture.'
</p>
<p> Virtuti om.ni parent. " Depend all upon the energies of mind for
</p>
<p>their successful employment."
</p>
<p>5. Peregrinantes. A beautiful expression, by which the sen-

</p>
<p>our lection fama and invidia are likewise ablatives, but eadem
</p>
<p>is in the nominative agreeing with cwpido. The whole passage may
</p>
<p>be rendered as follows :  " And though I was uncontaminated by the
</p>
<p>evil principles of others, nevertheless the same desire of advance-
</p>
<p>ment disquieted me, by reason of the obloquy and odium that ac-
</p>
<p>companied it, which disquieted the rest," i. e. standing forth as a
</p>
<p>candidate for public honours, I shared the fate of others : my char-
</p>
<p>acter was assailed with obloquy, and an attempt was made by my
</p>
<p>political opponents to render me an object of popular odium.  De

<p>Brosses thinks that Sallust here endeavours to offer a plausible excuse

<p>for his recent and disgraceful expulsion from the senate.

<p>expression in the first chapter, " animi imperio, coporis seroitio ma-
</p>
<p>gis utimury The charge therefore which some bring against Sal-
</p>
<p>lust, of his stigmatizing agriculture and hunting as employments fit
</p>
<p>only for slaves, rests on an entirely erroneous acceptation of the epi
</p>
<p>thet servilihus.

</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>by Cortius, making contagio an ablative from the old form zonta- g4
</p>
<p>gium: {Contagio quasi, *'by a sort of moral contagion.") The
</p>
<p>Bipont edition removes the comma after quasi, placing one after
</p>
<p>contagio, and another after pestilentia. Contagio then becomes the
</p>
<p>nominative to invasit. In either reading, contagio has mtiorum
</p>
<p>understood.
</p>
<p>11. Propius virtutem erat. Sailust means, that ambition, though
</p>
<p>a vice, has som& affinity to virtue, which cupidity has not. Virtutem
</p>
<p>is governed by ad understood. We find the preposition supplied in
</p>
<p>Plautus, {Mil. Glor. 4, 6, 55.) " Si accesserii prope ad tc f and
</p>
<p>again, {Mostcll 2, 2, 30,) " Fuge ad me propius:'
</p>
<p>12. Bonus, ignavus. " The man who has merit and he who is
</p>
<p>devoid of it."  Vera via. " By the true path," i. e. by fair and
</p>
<p>honourable means.
</p>
<p>13. Siudium habet. "Implies the desire."
</p>
<p>14. Venenis malis. "With poisons." Venenum, like facinus,
</p>
<p>&c., is what the grammarians call medium nomen. It properly
</p>
<p>signifies " that which by its penetrating influence changes the natural
</p>
<p>qualities of any thing." As this may be either beneficial or injurious,
</p>
<p>venenum hence may indicate in the latter case " a poison," and in
</p>
<p>the former "a drug," "a medicine," " a colouring matter." In tiiis
</p>
<p>passage Sailust uses the term in its strict acceptation, and therefore
</p>
<p>adds the qualifying adjective ; so that venenis malis, when literally
</p>
<p>rendered, will signify " with pernicious (or poisonous) drugs," i. e.
</p>
<p>poisons. This, after all, however, is somew^hat of an affected
</p>
<p>archaism on the part of our historian, since the purest Latin writers
</p>
<p>are accustomed to use the w^ord venenum, when standing alone, in a
</p>
<p>bad sense, without employing any adjective. The old form of ex-
</p>
<p>pression occurs in a lav/ cited by Cicero, (^pro Cluent. 54,) " Qui
</p>
<p>venenum malum fecit,''' &c. (Compare Emesti and Schiitz, Index
</p>

<p>15. Neque copia, &c. The idea intended to be conveyed is this :
</p>
<p>He who possesses much is as strongly influenced by the desire of
</p>
<p>having more, as he whose present resources are scanty ; and while
</p>
<p>want urges on the latter, the possession of abundant means does not
</p>
<p>quench the thirst for gain in the former. The desire of wealth makes
</p>
<p>both of them its slaves.

<p>g/J to be succeeded by an evil issue." The first acts of Sylla, upon his
</p>
<p>attaining to the unlimhed control of the state, argued well for its
</p>
<p>interests. He favoured the party of the nobiHty, which Marin s,
</p>
<p>plebeian in origin, had always sought to depress, and he seemed on
</p>
<p>the point also of reviving the ancient constitution. The mask,
</p>
<p>however, was soon dropped, and the most horrid excesses ensued.
</p>
<p>Compare Velleius Paterculus, (2, 25,) '' Putares Sullam vemsse in

</p>
<p>in the excesses of licentiousness and intoxication." Potare is " to

</p>
<p>naturae necessitatem ; potant ebriosi affluenter, et ad ebrietatem."
</p>
<p>(Popma.) As Sallust means to say that the Romian soldiers had
</p>
<p>acquned in Asia the habit of drinking to excess, bibere would evi-
</p>
<p>dently have been inadmissible in the text.

</p>
<p>as the mere offspring of a malevolent feeling," i. e. they gave him
</p>
<p>who led a virtuous hfe no credit for sincerity, but supposed him to
</p>
<p>be actuated merely by a spirit of malevolence and opposition, and a
</p>
<p>wish to set his own mode of life in direct contrast with that of the

</p>
<p>but the former is imphed in the latter, arid therefore need not be
</p>
<p>expressed. Other manuscripts give hostibus, but this again is

<p>already implied in the term sociis. " Quasi socios istosj^^ observes

</p>
<p>of the waters, and which were commonly of such vast dimensions
</p>
<p>as almost to deser\'e the name of seas. Some editions, however,
</p>

<p>norosorum, the abstract for the concrete. " Of all kinds of profli-
</p>
<p>gate and daring spirits." Facinus, as we have already observed in
</p>
<p>a previous note, means ^ bold or daring action. Flagitium, though
</p>
<p>generally referring to lustful excess, denotes any fault, error, or
</p>
<p>crime, v/nich reflects more or less disgrace on the offender ; and im
</p>
<p>plies a less degree of moral guilt than scelus. ( Crombie^s Gymna

<p>12. Cumvirgme nohili. Who the female here alluded to was J^^
</p>
<p>s not clearly ascertained. It is generally thought that the histo- /;
</p>
<p>ians of those times suppressed the name out of respect for the noble
</p>
<p>lineage to which she belonged. The daughter who was the offspring
</p>
<p>of this intercourse is spoken of by Plutarch, {vit. Cic. 10, ed. Hut-
</p>
<p>ten, vol. 5, p. 318,) and is referred to by Cicero, {frag. orat. in tog.

</p>
<p>for a violation of her vow. Several of the most respectable citizens,
</p>
<p>however, either convinced of her innocence, or wishing to thwart the
</p>
<p>tribune, exerted themselves in her defence with such success, that
</p>
<p>she not only obtained sentence of acquittal, but her prosecutor was
</p>
<p>obliged to flee from Rome. - Cato, Catulus, and Cicero, espoused
</p>
<p>her cause. She was the sister of Terentia, the wife of Cicero. In the
</p>
<p>picture which Cicero draws of the scandalous misdeeds of Catiline,
</p>
<p>no mention is made by him of this incident, probably out of respect
</p>
<p>for his sister-in-law.  The Vestal virgins were introduced at Rome
</p>
<p>Dy Numa, in imitation of a similar priesthood existing at Alba.
</p>
<p>They were originally four in number. Two were subsequently
</p>
<p>added by Tarquinius Priscus, or by Servius Tullius, and six con-
</p>
<p>tinued to be the number ever after. These priestesses had charge
</p>
<p>of the sacred fire, and were bound to inviolable chastity. When
</p>
<p>convicted of dishonour, they were buried alive in the campus scele-
</p>
<p>ratus, and then' paramours scourged to death in the forum. ( Vid.

<p>own, in the number of months, and of the days in each ; but instead
</p>
<p>of reckoning in an uninterrupted series, from the first to the thirty-
</p>
<p>first, they had three points from which their days were counted. 
</p>
<p>1. The Calends or Kalends, which were always the first day of the
</p>
<p>month. They receiv-ed then* name from the old verb calare, be-

</p>
<p>g'y cause the priests, who had the charge of the Calendar, were required
</p>
<p>to proclaim the first day of the month pubUcly to the people, and to
</p>
<p>mention at the same time, the number of days between the Calends
</p>
<p>and the Nones. This last was done, because it behoved the people
</p>
<p>who lived in the country, ^o assemble in the city on the Nones of
</p>
<p>each month, in order to be informed by the rex sacrorum of the
</p>
<p>feasts and holidays, and to learn in general what they had to do, in
</p>
<p>regcird to sacred matters, during that month.  2. The Nones were,
</p>
<p>in the months of Pvlarch, May, July, and October, on the seventh ;
</p>
<p>in all other months on the fifth. They were so called because
</p>
<p>there were nme days, counting inclusively, between them and the
</p>
<p>Ides.  3, The Ides were on the fifteenth of March, May, July, and
</p>
<p>October, and on the thirteenth of the other months. They were so
</p>
<p>named fi-om the old verb iduare, because they nearly divided the
</p>
<p>month. The Romans always counted forwards to the Calends,
</p>
<p>Nones, or Ides, never backwards from them. After the first day of
</p>
<p>the month, therefore, they began to reckon so many days before the
</p>
<p>Nones ; after the Nones, so many days before the Ides ; after the
</p>
<p>Ides, so many days before the Calends of the next month. It is to
</p>
<p>be observed that the Romans, in computing their time, always
</p>
<p>included the day from which, and also the day to which, they reck-
</p>
<p>oned : thus they called the 1st January, Calendae ; the 31st Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, pridie Calendas or Calendarum ; and the 30th, not secundo, but
</p>
<p>tertio (ante) Calendas.  The year of the city when the circum-
</p>
<p>stances, mentioned in the text, took place, was A. U. C. 690,

</p>
<p>citizens or Latin aUies sent out by public authority, either fo take
</p>
<p>possession of lands captured in war, and to found thereon a new
</p>
<p>city, or to occupy cities which had fallen under the Roman sway.

<p>rights of Roman citizens. Of these there were dififerent kinds. Some

<p>possessed all the rights of Roman citizens, except such as could not

<p>be enjoyed without residing at Rome. Others enjoyed the right of

<p>es of praetor and consul, and was remarkable for the extent of his

<p>private wealth. Not long after the period of the ^conspiracy, he
</p>
<p>united with Pompey and Caesar in formhig the first triumvirate.

</p>
<p>upon trial, they were deprived of the consulship, and their competi-
</p>
<p>tors who accused them v^^ere nominated in their place. They were
</p>
<p>also, besides being fined, declared incapable of bearing any ofiice,
</p>
<p>or of coming into the senate, by the Calpurnian and other laws,
</p>
<p>Cicero made the punishment of bribery still more severe by the
</p>
<p>Tullian law, v>rhich he caused to be passed through the authority of
</p>
<p>the senate, by the additional penalty of a ten years' exile.
</p>
<p>4. Poenas dederant. In these, and similar phrases, it should be
</p>
<p>observed, that the proper meaning of the term poena is not " punish-
</p>
<p>ment," but " atonement." Thus dai'e poenas is, " to give satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion," " to make atonement," or " to be punished :" and sumere poe-
</p>
<p>nas is, " to exact atonement," " to take satisfaction," or " to pun-
</p>
<p>ish." Compare the corresponding Greek forms iovvai clkyjv and
</p>
<p>5. Pecuniarum repetundarum. This latter w*ord is simply the

<p>Our English word extortion, though generally given as the transla-

<p>action repetundarum, was brought not merely for the recovery of

<p>what had been extorted from the individual who comnlained, but

<p>also for what had been obtained by the Roman governors under

<p>15. Ea re cogmta. Suetonius {vit. Caes. 9.) makes mention of
</p>
<p>a plot in which Caesar and Crassus were said to have been en-
</p>
<p>gaged at this time. Their plan was to make an attack on the sen-
</p>
<p>ate at the beginning of the year, and, after they had slain whom
</p>
<p>they pleased of that body, for Crassus to assume the dictatorship
</p>
<p>and appoint Caesar his master of the horse. Crassus, either from
</p>
<p>repentance or fear, {jpoenitentia velmetu,) came not at the day ap-
</p>
<p>pointed, and Caesar consequently did not give the signal w^hich had
</p>
<p>been agreed upon, the dropping namely of his toga from his shoulders.
</p>
<p>The plot therefore failed. Suetonius makes no mention either of Cati-
</p>
<p>line or Piso as connected w4th this conspiracy, although it is evident
</p>
<p>that he and Saliust refer to one and the same event. A subsequent

<p>The term clientes, which occurs in the passage of Sallust to whi^,h

<p>26. uidgressos. For aggressos. This is generally termed an gg
</p>
<p>archaism ; but, according to Scheller, it is a question whether the
</p>
<p>ancients ever altered the form of the preposition when in composi-
</p>
<p>tion. He considers it always more accurate to retain as far as
</p>
<p>possible the prepositions in an unaltered form, as adfero, adtuli,
</p>
<p>adlatum; inretio, inmergo, &c. {Scheller, L. G. vol. 1, p. 129.)
</p>
<p>27, Praeterea. " In any other instance."  In medio relinquemus.
</p>
<p>Some editions have relinquimus. In medio relinquere is " to leave
</p>
<p>undetermined."
</p>
<p>1. In rem. " Of advantage."  Universos. "All, at one and 89
</p>
<p>the same time." Some critics have defined universi as meaning,
</p>
<p>*' all at one time," wliile cuncti denotes " all in one place." The
</p>
<p>present passage favours such a distinction, although instances are
</p>
<p>frequently met with where it is not observed, and where universi
</p>
<p>merely signifies " all together," or '* considered as one aggregate."
</p>
<p>{Quasi ad unum versi.)
</p>
<p>2. Aedium. " Of the house." The primitive meaning of aedes^
</p>
<p>in the singular, is " an apartment," or " room." Hence it denotes,
</p>
<p>in the same number, " a temple," i. e. an apartment or chamber for
</p>
<p>divine worship. In the plural it means " a house," i. e. a collection
</p>
<p>of apartments under one roof.
</p>
<p>3. Arhitris. "Witnesses." Noltenius defines arbiter to be,
</p>
<p>according to its primitive import, " Occulte adrepens, qui suis oculis
</p>
<p>videt, suisque aurihus audit.^^ The most probable opinion is, that
</p>
<p>it is derived from the obsolete verb liter e, '* to go," being com-
</p>
<p>pounded of ar for ad, and bitere, in the same way as we have arcesso
</p>
<p>for adycesso. Testis means " a v/itness," chiefly in a cause or
</p>
<p>trial. " One who bears testimony." {Crombie's Gijran. vol. 1, p.
</p>
<p>309.)
</p>
<p>4. Neque ego, &c. The personal pronouns in Latin are seldom
</p>
<p>if ever expressed without implying emphasis in a greater or less
</p>
<p>degree. Ego is here equivalent to eywys. *' Nor, I assure you,

<p>10. Tetrarchae. '' Tetrarclis." Tetra.rcha originally signified
</p>
<p>one who ruled over the fourth part of a country or kingdom, (from
</p>
<p>rirrapa and dpxfi-) Afterwards, however, the term merely came to
</p>
<p>denote a minor or inferior potentate, without any reference to the
</p>
<p>extent of territory governed. Thus, according to Strabo, Gallo-
</p>
<p>Graecia in Asia Minor was governed at first by twelve tetrarchs,
</p>
<p>afterwards by three, and lastly by two, previous to its being made a
</p>
<p>kingdom.
</p>
<p>11. Vectigales. Strictly speaking, the Stipendiarii, or Trihit-
</p>
<p>tarii, were those who paid their taxes in money ; and the Vectigales
</p>
<p>were those who gave a certain part of the produce of the soil to the
</p>
<p>republic. The words, however, as in the present instance, are
</p>
<p>sometimes confounded.
</p>
<p>12. Populi, naticnes, &c. Gens is the root or stork, containing
</p>
<p>many families, (familiae,) or even nations, (nationes.) It is the
</p>
<p>generic term in respect to natio and familia. Thus the Germans
</p>
<p>may be called gens, the Saxons natio ; or, if we rise higher, the
</p>
<p>Europeans may be called gens, the Germans natio. Gens is even
</p>
<p>sometimes applied to the whole human race ; as, " Gens kominum
</p>
<p>est Jiuic belluae adversa.^'' {Plin. H. N. 8, 25.) Populus is more
</p>
<p>extensive than natio, but in general less so than gens, though in-
</p>
<p>stances are not unfrequent where populus d^ndigens directly coincide.
</p>
<p>The term populi m the text may be rendered by " communities."
</p>
<p>{Crombie's Gymnasium, vol. 2, p. 256.)

</p>
<p>if the republic were in a sound and healthy state, we would prove a
</p>
<p>source of continual alarm."
</p>
<p>14. Repulsas. *' Repulses in suing for ofRce." Some editions
</p>
<p>give repulsis as a participle. The term repulsas has nothing in it
</p>
<p>contrary to correct Latmity. Compare Livy, (39, 56,) ^^ post duas

<p>12. Tabulas novas. "An abolition of debts." The ordinary
</p>
<p>writing materials of the Romans were tablets covered with wax,

<p>paper, and parchment. Their stylus was broad at one end ; so that
</p>
<p>when they wished to corrects or erase any thing, they turned the
</p>
<p>stylus, and smoothed the wax with the broad end, after which the

</p>
<p>scription. Upon his return to the city, after having overthrown
</p>
<p>the party of Marius, he v^rote down the names of those whom he
</p>
<p>doomed to die, and ordered them to be fixed up in the pubHc places
</p>
<p>of the city, with the promise of a certain reward {duo talenta) for
</p>
<p>the head of each person so proscribed. New lists {tabulae proscrip-
</p>
<p>tionis) were repeatedly exposed, as new victims occurred to his
</p>
<p>memory or were suggested to him. The land and fortunes of the
</p>
<p>slain were divided among the friends of Sylla. Catihne promised

<p>the Romans censured can only be compared with the w^orst species
</p>
<p>of our opera-dancing, since they had also their religious dances,
</p>
<p>those of the Salii in particular, Vvhich were sanctioned by the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of ages. The Latin verb which we translate " to dance," pro-
</p>
<p>perly signifies, to leap high and frequently ; the con*esponding Greek

</p>
<p>or softness, opposed to what is harsh and rough, and the term is
</p>
<p>confined to the mode of expression : whereas facetiae is applicable

<p>19. Paction'e provinciae. The province of Macedonia had fallen
</p>
<p>to the lot of Cicero, but he generously yielded it to Antonius, who,
</p>
<p>being in indigent circumstances by reason of his dissipated hfe, was
</p>
<p>the more easily inclined to receive a rich province as the price of
</p>
<p>his adherence to the state. Antonius held the government of Mace-
</p>
<p>donia for two years after the expiration of his consulship, and, on his
</p>
<p>return to Rome, was brought to trial and sentenced to perpetual
</p>
<p>banishment, for extortion, and for making war beyond the bounds
</p>
<p>of his province. {Liv. epit. 103.) Before his elevation to the con-
</p>
<p>sulship, the censors had expelled him from the senate. Ho appears
</p>
<p>to have been a man of profligate habits.

<p>20. Ne contra rempmlicam, &c. *' N^t to cherish sentiments

</p>
<p>21. Clientium. The institution of patronage and clientship owed
</p>
<p>its origin to Romulus, according to the common account. That the
</p>
<p>patricians and plebeians might be connected together by the strictest
</p>
<p>bonds, the monarch ordained that every plebeian should choose from
</p>
<p>the patricians any one he pleased as his patron, or protector, whose
</p>
<p>client he was called. It v/as the part of the patron to advise and
</p>
<p>to defend his client, to assist him v/ith his interest and substance ;
</p>
<p>in short, to do every thing for him that a parent uses to do for his
</p>
<p>children. The client was obliged to pay all kind of respect to his
</p>
<p>patron and to serve him with his life and fortune in any extremity.
</p>
<p>As regards the origin, however, of this relation between the two
</p>
<p>orders, it is more than probable that the common account is incor
</p>
<p>rect. The institution of patronage would seem to have sprung from
</p>
<p>a state of society in which a superior caste exercised sway over an
</p>
<p>mferior one : nor is this one of the least interesting objects of
</p>
<p>inquiry connected with the early history of Rome.

<p>cum telo hominis occidendi causa xetat.''' Upon any sudden provo-

<p>they carried in a case. Hence probably the origin of the v\-ord stiletto

<p>tioned in the 17th chapter. According to Cicero, (1 in Cat. 4,  pro

<p>Sulla, 18,) the meeting v.-as held in the house of Laeca, on the night
</p>
<p>of the 6th November, ('' ea nocte, quae consecuta est posterum diera
</p>
<p>nonarum Novenihris, vie (Cicerone) consule.'-) Sallust evidently
</p>
<p>places the time of this meeting too early : he seems to have been
</p>
<p>under the impression that it was held about the close of October,
</p>
<p>since he only mentions the accusation of L. Paullus against Catihne
</p>
<p>(which occurred on the 22d October) in the 31st chapter. Cicero's
</p>
<p>account agrees with Sallust's as to this having been merely a par-
</p>
<p>tial meeting at the house of Laeca : " convenisse eodem complures
</p>
<p>ejusdem amentiae scelerisquc socios.^^ Dio Cassius only states that

</p>
<p>however, may easily be removed by supposing that Yargunteias,
</p>
<p>although a senator, was of equesirian extraction and rank. Plu-
</p>
<p>tarch calls the two individuals in question iMarcius and Cethegus,
</p>

<p>2. Volgi rumorihus exagitatam. " Noised abroad by reason of

<p>a decree of this nature.

<p>Cortms, and others, however, prefer nidli. It is questioned whether QA
</p>
<p>nulli be the dative case, according to the common form of declming,
</p>
<p>or the genitive, according to the older mode of inflection. It is
</p>
<p>thought by many that the position of the words strongly favours the
</p>
<p>latter opinion. We take the liberty of dissenting from this. The
</p>
<p>common mode of explaining the passage we consider perfectly
</p>
<p>unexceptionable : " without an express order of the people, no con-
</p>
<p>sul has the right of interfering in these things."

<p>7. Recitdvit. " Read aloud."  Legere. " To read," " to peruse

<p>8. Ante diem sextmn Kalendas Novembris. " On the sixth day
</p>
<p>before the Kalends of November," i. e. th^ 27th October. The
</p>
<p>Latin phrase is equivalent ,to die sexto ante Kalendas, or, according
</p>
<p>to the more usual form, sexto Kalendas. Ernesti and others make
</p>
<p>diem to be governed by in understood, which is expressed in many
</p>
<p>instances. Compare Cicero, Phil. 3, 8, " in ante diem iv. Kal.
</p>
<p>Dec.,'''' &c., and 1, in Cat. 3, '^Dixi ego idem in senatu, cae-
</p>
<p>dem te optimatum contulisse in ante diem v. Kcd. Novembres.^'*
</p>
<p>Zumpt, in his larger grammar, thinks that these apparently anoma-
</p>
<p>lous phrases probably arose from a transposition of ante ; and that
</p>
<p>having once written ante die tertio Kalendas, they would easily be
</p>
<p>led to change die into diem, as if it had been governed by ante. In
</p>
<p>his smaller grammar, (Bancroft's transl. p. 233,) he considers ante
</p>
<p>diem in the light of an unchangeable substantive, since prepositions
</p>
<p>which govern the accusative can be set before it. Compare the
</p>
<p>usage of pridie. " Nos in Formiano esse volumus usque ad pridie
</p>
<p>Nonas Maias." (Cic. ad Att. 2, 11.)

<p>until the senate had decided upon their application. If they vio-
</p>
<p>lated this rule, their military power instantly ceased, and their
</p>
<p>right to a triumph was lost, since no citizen was allowed to hold

<p>any miUtary power within the city-WLjls. It required a special law

<p>to be passed, giving them military authority within the ci\y ^n the

<p>weighed a pound, at last weighed but half an uncia. Of silver

<p>coins the denarius was originally equal to 10 asses, and the sester

<p>tins, as above mentioned, to two asses and a half. Hence the name

<p>7. In senatitm venit. This took place on the sixth day oefore
</p>
<p>the ides of November, (the 8th of the month, according to our modo
</p>
<p>of reckoning,) and the meeting of the senate was held in the tem-
</p>
<p>ple of Jupiter Stator, where Cicero had convened that body. The
</p>
<p>attempt on the consul's life {vid. chap. 28,) was made the day pre-
</p>
<p>vious. Cicero informs us that Catiline was shunned by all the
</p>
<p>assembled senators. {Cic. in Cat. 2, 6.)
</p>
<p>8. Praesentiam ejus timens. Catiline's presence in the senate,
</p>
<p>on this occasion, v/as probably feared by Cicero for two reasons :
</p>
<p>first, lest, with the aid of those members who were implicated in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, he might break forth into some act of violence ; and,
</p>
<p>secondly, lest the very circumstance of his openly appearing in that
</p>
<p>assembly, might lead many to believe that he was an innocent and
</p>
<p>calumniated man.
</p>
<p>9. Oraiionem hahuit, &c. *' Delivered an oration, brilliant in
</p>
<p>itself and beneficial in its results to the republic." The speech, to
</p>
<p>which allusion is here made, was the first oration against Catiline.
</p>
<p>So splendid a burst of extemporaneous eloquence deserves far
</p>
<p>higher encomiums than the cold and formal praise bestowed by the
</p>
<p>historian. This oration of Cicero proved of service to the state
</p>
<p>on two accounts : it rendered the conspiracy formed against the
</p>
<p>republic so clear, that no one could doubt its existence, and it com-
</p>
<p>pelled Catiline to retire from the city.

<p>on the occasion alluded to in the text, Catiline attempted to address
</p>
<p>the house in defence of his conduct, before Cicero rose up ; but
</p>
<p>that when he began to speak, the senators interrupted him in such
</p>
<p>a manner that he could not be heard. He is silent respecting any
</p>
<p>feply having been made by him to the oration of the consul. It
</p>
<p>Vv^oald appear from this, but more especially from a remark of
</p>
<p>Cicero, in his speech for Muraena, (chapter 25,) that the narrative
</p>
<p>of Sallust is here erroneous. According to Cicero, Catiline uttered
</p>
<p>a threat similar to that mentioned in the text, a few days before,
</p>
<p>Vv^hen replying to Cato, who menaced him in the presence of the
</p>
<p>senate with a public trial. Cicero, moreover, (2 Cat. 6,) in giving
</p>
<p>an account to the people, on the followung day, of what had passed
</p>
<p>m the senate when he openly charged Catiline with his guilt, states
</p>
<p>expressly that the latter, in spite of his boldness, did not dare to
</p>
<p>make any reply to his speech. We find the same remark also m

<p>of Sdllust.

</p>
<p>plotting the destruction of his country, the common parent of all.

<p>Page,
</p>
<p>account of itS having been occasioned by the conduct of a usurer Q^
</p>
<p>named Lucius Papirius. It was passed A. U. C. 428, and ordained
</p>
<p>that no person should be held in fetters or stocks, except convicted
</p>
<p>5f a crime, and in order to punishment ; but that, for money due, the
</p>
<p>goods of the debtor, not his person, should be answerable. {Liv.
</p>
<p>8, 28.) Livy remarks of this law, that it broke one of the strongest
</p>
<p>bonds of credit. " Victum eo die, oh impotentem injuriam univs,
</p>
<p>ingens mnculum fidei."" On this account, as may well be supposed,
</p>
<p>it was unfavourably received by the rich, and had to be re-enacted
</p>
<p>forty years afterwards, at the time of the secession to the Janiculum.
</p>
<p>6. Liherum corpus habere. The cruelty and oppression, which
</p>
<p>marked the conduct of the rich towards their unfortunate debtors
</p>
<p>occasioned most, if not all, of the distm-bances that interfered with
</p>
<p>the earlier growth of the Roman state.
</p>
<p>7. Praetoris. To the praetors belonged the general adniiuistra-
</p>
<p>tion of public justice. The city praetor {praetor urhanus) is here
</p>
<p>alluded to : he took cognizance of all litigations between citizens.
</p>
<p>The praetor pe7'egri7ius dispensed justice to foreigners at Rome, or
</p>
<p>to foreigners and citizens v;hen involved in controversy.
</p>
<p>8. Major es vestrmn. Almost all the manuscripts have vestri for
</p>
<p>vestnim; but, according to Aulus Gellius, (20, 6,) the oldest copies
</p>
<p>in his time exhibited vcstrum. Correct Latinity requires this latter
</p>
<p>form in the present case. Nostri and vestri are used when the
</p>
<p>genitive denotes the object ; as amor nostri, cura nostri, miserere
</p>
<p>nostri, &c., bat 7iostru7n and vestrum must be employed when the
</p>
<p>genitive indicates the subject ; as frequentia vestrum, contentio
</p>
<p>vestrum, &c. (Vid. Zumpt. L. G. p. 241.)

<p>of this law, i\ie fourth part only of the debt was paid, namely, an

<p>as for a sestertius, and a sestertius for a de7iarius ; or 25 for 100,
</p>
<p>and 250 for 1000. The sestertius was originally equal to two asses
</p>
<p>and a half ; and the denarius to ten ; v/hen, however, the weight of
</p>
<p>the as was diminished to one ounce, a denarius jiassed for sixteen
</p>
<p>asses, and a sestertius for four, which proportion continued when
</p>
<p>the as was reduced to half an ounce. Velleius Paterculus (2, 23,)
</p>
<p>speaks of the Valerian law above micntioned, in terms of merited
</p>
<p>reprobation. " Valerius Fiaccus, licrpissimae legis auctor, qua

<p>by many of the learned, was finally removed from his work.
</p>
<p>11. Secessit. Three secessions of the people are recorded m
</p>
<p>Roman history. The first took place A. U. C. 260, on^ account of
</p>
<p>the severity of creditors, and v^as made to the sacred mount. {Liv.
</p>
<p>2, 32.) The second was occasioned by the conduct of A]:)pius
</p>
<p>Claudius, the decemvir, and w^as made first to the Aventine and
</p>
<p>afterwards to the sacred mount. {Liv. 3, 50.) It happened A. U.
</p>
<p>C. 305. The third was produced by the same cause as the first,
</p>
<p>and was made to the Janiculum, A. U. C. 466. {Liv. epit. lib. 11.)
</p>
<p>12. Nemo honus. '' No man of spirit."
</p>
<p>13. Amittit. " Parts with." The student will observe that per^z/
</p>
<p>would change entirely the spirit of the passage. Amittere is simply
</p>
<p>" to lose the possession of a thing which one has once had." Per-
</p>
<p>dere, on the other hand, is " to lose," " destroy," or " throw away
</p>
<p>uselessly or hurtfully." Thus, in the treatise addressed to Heren-
</p>
<p>iiius, (4, 44,) we have the following : " Quod mihi bene mdetur
</p>
<p>Decius intellexisse, qui se devovisse dicituVy et pro legionibus in
</p>
<p>hostes intulisse medios ; unde amisit vitam, at non perdidit." (Vid.
</p>
<p>Crombie^s Gymyiasium, vol. 1, p. 98.)
</p>
<p>14. Quonam modo^ &c. " In what way we may perish, after
</p>
<p>having most effectually avenged our blood ;" i. e. how we may sell
</p>
<p>our lives as dearly as possible.
</p>
<p>15. Marcius. The verb re^pow^/ns elegantly understood. Thus,
</p>
<p>Phaediiis, 1,25,8, ^^ At ille, facerem mehercule, nisi esse scirem
</p>
<p>carnis te cupidum meae.^^ {Vid. Palairefs Latin Ellipses^ p. 254.)
</p>
<p>16. Optumo cuique. " To each most eminent person." Optumo
</p>
<p>cuique is here equivalent to optimatibus singulis. From a com-
</p>
<p>parison of various passages in Cicero, it would appear that optimates,
</p>
<p>in that writer, denotes " persons distinguished by rank or political
</p>
<p>merit," and sometimes the former only. Crombie^s Gymnasium^

</p>
<p>H. Stephens {Schediasm. 2, 7,) and Laurentius Valla {Eleg. 2, 37,)

</p>
<p>of the Romans, the following remarks may not be misplaced. If

<p>' Praetores Syracaisani Marcello suo.'^ The ' Praeloquium" was
</p>
<p>sometimes conceived in the following terras ; ' Si vales, gaudeo ;

</p>
<p>V. or S V. B. E. E. V. that is, *' Si rales, bene est, ego valeo.'^ The.
</p>
<p>'letter frequently ended with the word " Vale,-'' sometimes *' Are,-'
</p>
<p>or " Salve,^^ to which, in some instances, was added the expression
</p>
<p>of endearment, " Mi ammey The place where the letter was
</p>
<p>written was subjoined, unless previously communicated. The date
</p>
<p>always expressed the day, frequently the year, and sometimes the
</p>
<p>hour. They used no signature, or subscription, unless when writ-
</p>
<p>ing to emperors. There was ver}' rarely an inscription on the out-
</p>
<p>side, the letter being delivered to a letter-carrier, {Tabellarius.) who
</p>
<p>was made acquainted with the person for whom it was intended.
</p>
<p>The letter was tied round with a string, the knot of which was
</p>
<p>sealed. The seal was, generally, a head of the letter-writer, or of
</p>
<p>some of his ancestors, impressed on wax or chalk. Hence the
</p>
<p>phrases for " to open a letter," are -' vinculum solvere,'' '^inddere
</p>
<p>linum^ " epistolam solvere.-' It was usual also for the bearer of

<p>the letter, before it was opened, to request the person to examine

<p>4. Quam. Referring to satisf actionem.
</p>
<p>5. Me dius fidius, &c. "Which, upon my honour as a man,
</p>
<p>you will find to be true." As regards the expression dius fidius,
</p>
<p>Festus makes it the same as At'o? fdius, " the son of Jove," i. e.
</p>
<p>Hercules. He states, at the same time, two other explanations ;
</p>
<p>one, which makes it equivalent to divi fides, and the other to diei
</p>
<p>fides. All these etymologies are decidedly erroneous. A passage
</p>
<p>in Plautus, {Asin. 1, 1, 8,) furnishes a safer guide. It is as follows :
</p>
<p>'^ Per deumfidium quaeris ; jurato mihi video necesse esse eloqui^
</p>
<p>quidquid roges.''^ From this passage we may fairly infer, that, in
</p>
<p>the phrase under consideration, dius is the same as deus or divus,
</p>
<p>Sindfijiius an adjective formed from fides. Hence dius fidius, "the
</p>
<p>god of honour," or " good faith," w"iil be the same as the Zfr)?
</p>
<p>TcidTiog of the Greeks ; and, if we follow the authority of Varro, (L. L.
</p>
<p>4, 10,) identical with the Sabine Sancus, and Roman Hercules : ro
</p>
<p>that me dius fidius is nothing more than me deus fidei (i. e. Hercules)
</p>
<p>adjuvet, or, m other words, mehercule.
</p>
<p>6. Fructu lahoris. Alluding to the consulship, w-hich he had
</p>
<p>sought ineffectually.
</p>
<p>7. Statum dignitatis. ''That station in the republic to which I
</p>
<p>was fairly entitled." Compare ch. 18, " Post paullo Gatilina, pecu-
</p>
<p>iiiarum repetundarum reus, prohihitus erat consul alum petere,-'' &c.

<p>8. Meis 7iominihus. " Of my owm contracting."  Alienis nomi-
</p>
<p>nihus. " Contracted by others, and for which I had become surety."
</p>
<p>Among the Romans, it was a customary formality, in borrowing
</p>
<p>money, to write dowm the sum and subscribe the person's name in

</p>
<p>sufficiently honourable, considering my calamitous situation, and
</p>
<p>one which leads me to entertain the hope of preserving what con
</p>
<p>sideration there is left me."

<p>12. Earn ah injuria defendas, &c. "Defend her from injury,
</p>
<p>being intreated so to do by the love you bear to your own off-
</p>
<p>spring."
</p>
<p>13. Havcto. An archaism for Avcto. Catullus uses this form
</p>
<p>nOl, 10,) ^^ Have atque Vale^ Compare Quintilian, 1, 6, 21, ed.
</p>
<p>Spalding. Whiter's etymology of the word is extremely ingenious :
</p>
<p>" Have or Ave is nothing but Uahe, have, possess  riches, honours,
</p>
<p>health."
</p>
<p>14. In agro Arretino. The common text has Rea.tino. As
</p>
<p>Reate, how^ever, was a town of the Sabines, and as Catiline was
</p>
<p>proceedmg along the i^urelian way, under the pretence of retiring to
</p>
<p>Massilia, but in reality to join Manlius, it is far preferable to adopt
</p>
<p>ArretiiLO as the lection, Arretiiim (now Arezzo) being an ancient
</p>
<p>city of Etruria.
</p>
<p>15. Sine fraude. " With impunity," or " with the assurance of
</p>
<p>safety." Compare the w^ords of Ulpian, Cleg. 131, de V. S.) '' Aliud
</p>
<p>fraus est, aliiid poena. Fraus enim sine poena esse potest : poena
</p>
<p>sine fraude esse non potest. Poena est iioxae vindicta ; fraus e*
</p>
<p>ipsa noxa dicitur, et quasi poenae quaedam pracparatio.''''
</p>
<p>] 6. Praetcr condemnatis. In this clause, condemnatis
</p>
<p>depends on liceret, and praeter is used adverbially for praeterquam.
</p>
<p>The instances, however, of such a usage are not of very frequent
</p>
<p>occurrence. We have one in Justin, (13, 5,) ^^ Alexander cpistolas
</p>
<p>IV Graeciam scripserat, quibus omnium civitatum cxules, praeter
</p>
<p>cocdis damnditi, restituebantur.''^ {Vid. Graev. ad loc.) Another
</p>
<p>e'z-ample is found in Suetonius, though not so conclusive as the tirst :

<p>1. Tinia vis morbi, uti tabes. *' So violent a malady, like some ||^

</p>
<p>to, is the desire of a change, which influenced, at that period, the

<p>minds of so large a number, and produced a disaffection to the
</p>

</p>
<p>their own, look with an evil eye on the higher class of citizens,
</p>
<p>elevate to office those who are of the same stamp with themselves."
</p>
<p>Quis is put for quibus. By honos are here meant, not the good and
</p>
<p>virtuous merely, but, generally speaking, the better class of citizens,
</p>
<p>who are always more or less averse to violent changes in the state,
</p>
<p>as well from principle, as from the danger which might result to
</p>
<p>their private affairs. By malos, on the other hand, are meant the
</p>
<p>needy and unprincipled. Compare Plautus, (Captiv. 3, 4, 51,)
</p>
<p>'''Est miserorum ut malevolentes sint atque invideant bonis."
</p>
<p>4. TurhcL. '* By public disturbance."  Sine cura. *' Without
</p>
<p>any apprehension for themselves."  Habetur, " Is kept," or
</p>
<p>" exists." The idea expressed in the text, when paraphrased, will
</p>
<p>be, " since poverty does not easily suffer loss."
</p>
<p>6. Plches. To be construed as the nominative absolute. Some edi-
</p>
<p>tions read a vero, instead of ea vero^ removing at the same time the
</p>
<p>comma after plehes, which of course alters the construction. This
</p>
<p>emendation, however, is far inferior to the reading in our text. From
</p>
<p>a view of the context it wdll appear, that Sallust first speaks of the
</p>
<p>people in general, the people of the whole empire, {cuncta plches
</p>
<p>Gmnino.) He then particularizes the people of the capital, and remarks,
</p>
<p>that, with regard to them, there were other and more special reasons,
</p>
<p>the operation of which led them to favour the designs of Catiline.
</p>
<p>6. Priw.um omnium. Opposed, not to item and postremo, in the
</p>
<p>same sentence, but to Delude, at the commencement of- tho

</p>
<p>7. Per dedecora. " By disgraceful excesses."
</p>
<p>8. Sicuti in sentinam. "As into some impure receptacle."
</p>
<p>Sentina is properly the bottom of a ship, where the bilge-water
</p>
<p>collects. It is applied also by Cicero to the rabble, &c.

</p>
<p>clared the children of proscribed persons incapable of holding any-

<p>Lepidus, as given by Sallust, (Hist. frag. lih. 1, p. 936, ed. Cort.)
</p>
<p>About twenty years after this event, a powerful effort was made by
</p>
<p>the mdividuals who were suffering under the operation of this law,
</p>
<p>to have it repealed. Cicero was at that time consul, and by his
</p>
<p>strenuous exertions defeated the application. Of the oration de-
</p>
<p>livered by him on this occasion, (De proscriptorum liberis,) a
</p>
<p>solitary fragment is preserved by Quintilian, (11, 1,) " Quid enim
</p>
<p>crudeliics quam homines honesHs parentilus ac majoribus natos a

</p>
<p>Olivet, vol. 6, p. 479.) Cicero himself alludes to his conduct in
</p>
<p>this affair, in his oration against Piso, (chap. 2.) He allowed the
</p>
<p>claim to be perfectly reasonable, but argued against it on the ground
</p>
<p>of state-policy. Julius Caesar, however, subsequently abrogated
</p>
<p>this unjust ordinance. Thus Suetonius, [Jul. 41,) remarks, ^^ Ad-

</p>
<p>15. Tribunicia potestas restitutn. The tribunes of the commons
</p>
<p>were originally created A. U. C. 260, at the time of the secession
</p>
<p>to the sacred mount, for the purpose of protecting the rights of the
</p>
<p>people. Under the sanction, however, of the law which made their
</p>
<p>persons sacred, they subsequently carried their power to the most
</p>
<p>extravagant height. Sylla abridged, and in a manner extinguished,
</p>
<p>that power, by enacting, that whoever had been tribune should not
</p>
<p>260 NaXES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>Qg afterwards enjoy any other magistracy ; that there should be no
</p>
<p>appeal to the tribunes ; that they should not be allowed to assemble
</p>
<p>the people and make harangues to them, nor propose law^s, but
</p>
<p>should only retain the right of intercession. In the consulship of
</p>
<p>Cotta, however, (A. U. C. 679,) they again obtained the right of
</p>
<p>enjoying other offices ; and in that of Pompey and Crassus, A. U.
</p>
<p>C. 683, all their former powers. Pompey's conduct in this affair is
</p>
<p>very justly condemned by Cicero, since the tribunes now became
</p>
<p>mere tools in the hands of the ambitions and powerful.
</p>
<p>16. Summam potestatem nacti. These words have very much
</p>
<p>the appearance of an interpolation. They are not necessary to the
</p>
<p>sense, since by summam potestatem is meant the tribunician powder,
</p>
<p>which has already been mentioned in the preceding clause.

</p>
<p>authority of the senate, but in reality for their own advancement."

<p>3. Honesiis nomirdhus. " Under fair pretexts."
</p>
<p>3. Nequemodestianeque modus. " Neither moderation nor limit."
</p>
<p>4. Maritimum. The maritime war against the Cilicians, sup-
</p>
<p>ported by Mithridates, called also the piratical war. The Cilician
</p>
<p>pirates, covered every sea with their fleets, and extended their dep-
</p>
<p>redations even to the coast of Italy and the mouth of the Tiber
</p>
<p>Pompey was sent against them, by virtue of the Gabinian law% A
</p>
<p>U. C. 687, and brought the war to a conclusion within the space of

<p>5. Mithriddticum. The war with Mithridates, king of Pontus,
</p>
<p>one of the ablest monarchs with whom the Romans ever had to con-

<p>less literally, " free from all danger of attack." Compare Lucan,

<p>9. Placidius. " More peaceably." The meaning of the clause QCJ
</p>
<p>.S5, that those who filled offices of magistracy, especially the tri-
</p>
<p>buneship, might be less disposed to stir up commotions among
</p>
<p>the people, through dread of prosecution by the nobility, after the
</p>
<p>expiration of their offices.

<p>be less in accordance with the style of Saliust, than the present

<p>novandi, and place a comma after primum, and another after rebus.

</p>
<p>this same circumstance, calls the name of the father A. Fuivius,
</p>
<p>Cortius thinks it probable that Saliust wrote A. Fuhii senatoris

<p>19. Percunctatus. Percunctari (or perconiari) means '* to sif
</p>
<p>to the bottom by search or inquiry," " to pry," and has, according
</p>
<p>to Dumesnil, a relation very often to public news. It is derived
</p>
<p>probably from per and contus, (quasi per contum exquirere,) and ex-
</p>
<p>presses a sifting and inquisiMve manner of asking. Percunctari^

<p>7. Maj ores opes. "More powerful resources;" those namely
</p>
<p>of the republic. Bureau deLamalle renders the phrase by " une
</p>
<p>grande masse de puissance."
</p>
<p>8. Patrocinio. Individual noblemen, or particular families of
</p>
<p>illastrious rank, were sometimes patrons of whole states. These
</p>
<p>patrons were generally those who had reduced them under the Ro-
</p>
<p>man power, or had, at some time or other, been appointed governors
</p>
<p>over them : and the rights of patronage were transmitted by them to
</p>
<p>their descendants. In the present instance, Q. Fabius Sanga derived
</p>
<p>his right of patronage from his ancestor Q. Fabius Maximus, who

<p>finally reduced the x^llobroges, and hence was surnamed Allohro- 1 ()(}
</p>
<p>gicus.
</p>
<p>9. Consilio cognito. " Havmg learned the plot."  Studium con-
</p>
<p>jurationis, &c. " To feign a strong desire for the success of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy."
</p>
<p>10. Bene polliceantur. " To promise fair." Bene is here equiv-
</p>
<p>alent to bona quaeque.
</p>
<p>11. Gallia citeriore. Hither or Cisalpine Gaul, lying south of
</p>
<p>the Alps, and forming the northern division of Italy. The term
</p>
<p>citerior is applied in reference to Rome.
</p>
<p>12. Cuncta simul agere. " Put all their schemes in operation at
</p>
<p>one and the same moment." Cortius wishes to exclude cuncta simul
</p>
<p>from the text, in opposition to all the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>13. Festinando, agitando omnia. *' By their precipitate move-
</p>
<p>ments, by their thrc^'ing all things into confusion."
</p>
<p>1. C. Murena. Brother of Licinius Murena, consul elect. The "I n |
</p>
<p>common reading in citeriore Gallia has been amended by Cortius,
</p>
<p>and in uUeriore Gallia substituted. There can be no doubt what
</p>
<p>ever as to the correctness of this alteration. Celer was in hither
</p>
<p>Gaul, and Murena, as appears plainly from Cicero, {j^ro Murena, 41, 'i
</p>
<p>was in Transalpine or farther Gaul.
</p>
<p>2. Legatus. A proconsul or propraetor chose a legatus to ac-
</p>
<p>company him to his province, and assist him in the discharge of his
</p>
<p>public duties. Thus Cicero, for example, when he went as pro-
</p>
<p>consul into Cilicia, A. U. C. 702, chose for his legatus his brother
</p>
<p>Quintus. In the absence of the governor of the province, the
</p>
<p>legatus exercised full control over it, and had equal authority and
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. Sometimes the governor remained at home, and
</p>
<p>merely sent out the legatus to the province ; and at other times
</p>
<p>the senate, without naming any proconsul or propraetor, merely
</p>
<p>sent out a legatus. This last was the case v/ith C. Murena.
</p>
<p>3. Videbantur. Understand illae, referring to copiae.
</p>
<p>4. Constituerant. The verb is put in the plural, as if Lenfulus

</p>
<p>5. Actionihus. " The proceedings," " the acts." Alluding to
</p>
<p>Ciccrro's having driven Catiline from the city, and excited, as they
</p>
<p>maintained, the most groundless suspicions against many innocent
</p>
<p>individuals. Compare Appian, {B. C. 2, 3,) Acvklov Se Brjariavj

<p>10 J a few dsLys before that of Cicero expired, would not suffer him to
</p>
<p>address the people. They placed their own benches on the rostra,
</p>
<p>and only gave him permission to take the oath upon laying
</p>
<p>down his office, after which he was immediately to descend. Ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, when Cicero went up, it was expected that he wo-uld
</p>
<p>take the customary oath ; but, silence being made, instead of the
</p>
<p>usual form, he adopted one that was new and singular. The pui
</p>
<p>port of it was, that " He had saved his countr}% and preserved the
</p>
<p>empire :" (?T ft^V ceawKS-vai rl)v -arpi^a^ kol StaTarrjprjKevai rr]v rjyej.iovLav,)
</p>
<p>and all the people joined in it.
</p>
<p>6. Invidiam. *' The blame."  Optumo consult. Some have
</p>
<p>regarded this expression on the part of the historian as extremely
</p>
<p>honourable, considering the private feud which existed between him
</p>
<p>and Cicero. We should be inclined to put a different construction
</p>
<p>upon it. Nothing appears to us more frigid than this language of
</p>
<p>Saliust respecting one who had been the preserver of his country.
</p>
<p>And that it would sound so in fact to a Roman ear, may be clearly
</p>
<p>inferred from a passage in one of the letters of Cicero to Atticus,
</p>
<p>(12, 21,) in which he speaks of Brutus having applied this same
</p>
<p>expression to him : "iiic autem se etiam iribuere multum mih
</p>
<p>putat, quod sci'ipserit optimum corisulem. Quis enim jejunius dixie
</p>
<p>inimicus ?"
</p>
<p>7. Froxuma node, Plutarch states, that one of the nights of the
</p>
<p>Saturnalia had been fixed for the perpetration of the horrid deeds
</p>
<p>mentioned in the text. The testimony of Cicero is to the same
</p>
<p>effect, (3, in Cat 4.) The celebration of the Saturnalia commenced
</p>
<p>on the 17th day of December, so that Bestia was to have delivered
</p>
<p>his intended harangue a few days after he had entered upon his
</p>
<p>office, which, in the case of the tribunes, Vv^as the 10th of the same
</p>
<p>month. On the 5th of December, however, the conspirators were
</p>
<p>-'ut to death.
</p>

</p>
<p>from that of Saliust. He informs us that the conspirators had

<p>divided Rome into a hundred parts, and selected the same number
</p>
<p>of men, to each of whom was allotted his quarter to be set on fire
</p>
<p>As this was to be done by them all at the same moment, they
</p>
<p>hoped that the conflagration would be general. Others were to
</p>
<p>intercept the water, and kill all that went to seek it.

</p>
<p>tion, olsido, ere.

<p>praetors, who had been sent to Cethegus's house, found there a
</p>
<p>large quantity of javelins, swords, poniards, and other arms, all newly

<p>be misplaced. Convenire in urhem. " To come into the city and
</p>
<p>assemble." Convenire in urhe. " To assemble in the city, having
</p>
<p>been there before." Convenire aliquem. " To speak to anyone,"
</p>
<p>or "to have an interview with him." Convenit hoc mihi. " This
</p>
<p>suits me," or, *' is convenient to me." Convenit mihi cum tllo. " I

<p>15. Jusjurandum. *' An oath :" i. e. a written promise in the

<p>language and form of an oath, that the conspirators would afford
</p>
<p>relief to the Allobroges, if the latter joined in the plot and it should

<p>it may not be amiss to staie that Cicero gives it somewhat differ-
</p>
<p>ently, (3, in Cat. 5.) It is more than probable, however, that the
</p>
<p>orator merely stated *the purport of it from mem.ory, while Sallust

<p>9. Cito cognito consilio. The Bipont edition omits cito, and
</p>
<p>Gruter all three words. They are retained, however, and on good
</p>
<p>grounds, by Cortius, Bumouf, Planche, &c. Gruter thinks, that,
</p>
<p>as the Gauls informed the consul of the night when they were to
</p>
<p>set out, they must of course have known that they would be arrested.
</p>
<p>This may all very w^ell be, and yet the presence of cito in the text,
</p>
<p>as well as of cognito consilio^ is perfectly proper. The Gauls in an
</p>
<p>instant understood the natiu'e of the affair, being previously con-
</p>
<p>vinced that an arrest would take place. Had Sallust, moreover,
</p>
<p>only written cognito consilio, the inquiry would naturally be made
</p>
<p>by the reader, whether the consul's plan was then for the first time

<p>a foreign country, offered for sale to Tarquinius Supe**bue th-"^ la^t
</p>
<p>king of Rome, nine books of the Sibylline, or prophetic oracle*?, bu'
</p>
<p>at an exorbitant price ; which Tarquin refusing, she burnt three of
</p>
<p>them, still demanding the same price for the remaining six. Being
</p>
<p>ridiculed by the king, she burnt three more, without abating her
</p>
<p>price for the remaining three. Tarquin, surprised at her strange
</p>
<p>conduct, consulted the augurs, w^ho, regretting the loss of the books
</p>
<p>which had been burnt, advised the king to pay her demand, on de
</p>
<p>livery of the three remaining books. Two persons at first, then ten

<p>7. Urhis potiri. The verb potiri, which elsewhere governs an
</p>
<p>ablative, is often, as in the present instance, used with a genitive.
</p>
<p>This government, however, admits of a very easy explanation, if we
</p>
<p>consider that potiri is in fact equivalent to potens esse or potentem
</p>
<p>esse. In Plautus we even find the active of this verb. {Amph. 1,
</p>
<p>1, 23,) " Quifuerim liber, eum nunc poiivit pater servitutis ;" i. e.
</p>
<p>*'has put in slavery," "has made partaker of slavery;" thence
</p>
<p>potior is used passively ; e. g. '^ potitiis est hostium,'^ {ibid. Capt. 1,
</p>
<p>2, 41,) " he is mastered by the enemy," " is in the enemy's power."
</p>
<p>8. Incenso Capitolio. The Capitol was thrice destroyed by fire.
</p>
<p>First, during the troubles occasioned by the contest betv^^een Sylla
</p>
<p>and Marius, A. U. C. 670, after which it was rebuilt by Sylla, and
</p>
<p>dedicated by Catulus. It is to this burning that the text refers. It
</p>
<p>was a second time destroyed, A. D. 70, by the soldiers of Vitellius.
</p>
<p>The emperor Vespasian rebuilt it, and at his death it was barnt a
</p>
<p>third time. Domitian restored it with greater magnificence than
</p>
<p>ever.
</p>
<p>9. Haruspices. The haruspices were those who examined the
</p>
<p>victims and their entrails after they were sacrificed, and from these
</p>
<p>derived omens of futurity. They pretended to divine also from the
</p>
<p>flame, smoke, and other circumstances attending the sacrifice. Do-
</p>
<p>natus {in Tcr. Phorm. 4, 4, 28) derives the name from haruga,
</p>
<p>*' a victim," observing, " nairi haruga dicitur hostia, ab hara in qua
</p>
<p>concluditur et servatur : hara autem est, in qua pecora includuntur.^^
</p>
<p>Compare Cicero, (3 in Cat. 8,) in relation to what is stated in the
</p>
<p>text. " Quo quidem tempore, cum haruspices ex tota Etruria con-
</p>
<p>venissent, caedes atque incendia, et legum interitum, et bellum civile
</p>
<p>ac domesticum, et totius urbis atque imperii occasum appropinquare
</p>
<p>dixcrunt, nisi dii immortales omni ratione placati suo numine prope
</p>

</p>
<p>quence celebrated for ten days, and every other formality observed
</p>
<p>for appeasing the wrath of the gods.

</p>
<p>which is that adopted by Cortius, shows more plainly ihat his office
</p>
<p>was taken from Lentulus, not voluntarily resigned by him.

<p>11. Lihcris custodiis. "In free custody," equivalent to our
</p>
<p>phrase, of "being held to bail." This was done either when the
</p>
<p>accused were persons of rank, or when they were many in number,
</p>
<p>and were separated so as to prevent any communication with one
</p>
<p>another.
</p>

<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. 269
</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>curule. Twoplebeiaa aedileswere first created, A. U. C. 260, in J 03
</p>
<p>the Comitia Curiata, at the same time with the tribunes of the
</p>
<p>commons, to be, as it were, their assistants, and to de4;ermine cer-
</p>
<p>tain minor causes, which the tribunes committed to them. They
</p>
<p>were afterwards created, as the other inferior magistrates, at the
</p>
<p>Comitia Trihuta. Two curule aediles were created from the
</p>
<p>patricians, A. U. C. 387, to perform certain pubHc games. They
</p>
<p>were first chosen alternately from the patricians and plebeians, but
</p>
<p>afterwards promiscuously from both. They wore the toga jpraetexia^
</p>
<p>had the right of images, and a more honourable place of gi'ving their
</p>
<p>opinion in the senate. They also used the sella curulis, whence
</p>
<p>their name of curule aediles. As a counterbalance for all this,
</p>
<p>however, the persons of the plebeian aediles were sacred, like those
</p>
<p>of the tribunes. The general office of the aediles was to take care
</p>
<p>of the city, (hence their, name a cur a aedium,) to regulate the
</p>
<p>markets, inspect the weights and measures, &.c.
</p>
<p>13. C. Caesari. The famous Julius Caesar, who was at this
</p>
<p>time praetor elect. It was excellent policy to entrust some of the
</p>
<p>conspirators to the care of Caesar and Crassus, who were suspected
</p>
<p>of being themselves concerned in the plot. By pretending to re-
</p>
<p>gard them as good and faithful citizens, the senate drove them to
</p>
<p>the necessity of assuming that character at least.

</p>
<p>thu-d against Catiline. In this he gave an account of the arrest of the
</p>
<p>AUobroges, and the transactions in the senate. The people then
</p>
<p>perceived the full extent of the danger from which they had just been
</p>
<p>rescued by the energy and vigilance of their consul, and gave him

</p>
<p>that plerique, in this clause, denotes a third class of persons, distinct

<p>from those to whom alii and pars respectively refer.  The great
</p>
<p>wealth of Crassus, and the numerous loans which it enabled him to

<p>affirmation, that Tarquinius had told a falsehood, and not the histo-
</p>
<p>rian's. The whole doctrine of the use of the relative with the sub-

<p>Suetonius {Vit. Caes. 17) informs us, that Caesar was named as

<p>Vettius before Novius Nigrus the quaestor, (or, perhaps, public

<p>informs us, that when Metellus, the chief pontiff, died, the office
</p>
<p>was solicited by Isauricus and Catulus, two of the most illustrious
</p>
<p>men in the city, and of the greatest interest in the senate. Caesar,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, did not shrink from the contest, but presented him^^elf
</p>
<p>to the people as a candidate. The pretensions and prospects ol the
</p>
<p>competitors seemed nearly equal ; and Catulus, who, on account of
</p>
<p>his superior dignity, was most uneasy about the event, sent privately
</p>
<p>to Caesar, and offered him large smns, on condition that he would

<p>20. Adolescentulo. " A mere youth when compared with him-

<p>evident the term adolescentulus is merely applied to him compara-

<p>him. Suetonius even states, that the number of gladiators just

<p>envy and opposition of his enemies. Caesar is said by Plutarch to

<p>tinues Plutarch, ** I know not why Cicero did not mention it in the

<p>for not having availed himself of so good an opportunity as he then

</p>
<p>{Vit. Caes. 14) informs us, that some of the knights threatened
</p>
<p>Caesar as he sat in the senate-house. It is probable that he and
</p>
<p>Sallust allude to different meetings.
</p>
<p>4. Minitarentur. The frequentative appears to be used in this
</p>
<p>passage, not so much for the sake of better sound, as in order to
</p>
<p>express the idea of a frequent brandishing of the sword, though it
</p>
<p>cannot be well conveyed in an Enztish translation.
</p>
<p>5. Liherti. The Romans used the term lilertus when they spoke
</p>
<p>of the master ; as, liherhis Lentuli ; but UoertinuSy in relation tu
</p>
<p>free-bom citizens, as, lihertmus hrnno^ i. e. non ingenuiis.
</p>
<p>6. Vicis. " The streets." Vicus, properly speaking, refers to
</p>
<p>the appearance presented by the buildings in a street ; a row of
</p>
<p>houses resembling, as it were, a single and extensive edifice,
</p>
<p>(oijcoc, and, with the digamma, WoZko^, whence vicus.) The term is
</p>
<p>used here, however, in the sense of via,

<p>7. Erijpicndum, Understand e custodia. Cicero (4, in Cat. 8)
</p>
<p>states, that none were found who would engage in such an attempt.

<p>Appian, however, informs us, that on the nones of December, w bile
</p>
<p>the senate were deliberating about the punishment of the conspira
</p>
<p>tors, the slaves and freedmen of Lentulus and Cethegus, and a
</p>
<p>large body of working people, assailed the habitations of the praetors
</p>
<p>in the rear, and endeavoured to rescue the prisoners. Cicero, upon

<p>learning this, unmediateiy left the senate, and planted guards in

<p>suitable quarters of the city, after which he retomed and expedited

<p>the debate. {Apjrian, B. C. 2, 5.)

<p>8. Duces multitudinum. " The leaders of the mob." The want
</p>
<p>of trades and manufactures, which the Romans considered as em-

<p>ployments unworthy of freemen, left the great body of the inhabi-

<p>the consuls were chosen about the end of July or the beginning of

<p>August, and entered on their office on the first day of January.
</p>
<p>During the interval they were styled Consules designati, and were
</p>
<p>always asked their opinions first in the senate. This interval was
</p>
<p>made so long, that they might have time to become acquainted with
</p>
<p>what pertained to their office ; and that inquiry might be made
</p>
<p>whether they had gained their election by bribery.

<p>14. Pedibus in sententiam, &c. *' That he would embrace the
</p>
<p>opinion expressed by Tiberius Nero." The history of this whole

<p>aflfair appears to have been as follows : Silanus gave his opinion at
</p>
<p>first in favour of the severest punishment, {tov(; avSpas ea-x^^'^V Ko\dau
</p>
<p>neTitvai. Appian, B. C. 2, 5.) Many senators followed in the de-
</p>
<p>bate, and advocated the same course, {tcoWoX arwErWeuro. Appian,

<p>dius Nero (grandfather of the future emperor) to deliver his senti-
</p>
<p>ments, he recommended that the conspirators should be detained in
</p>
<p>custody until Catiline w^as overcome, and that then the whole affair
</p>
<p>should be carefully investigated. Caesar, who was at this time
</p>
<p>praetor elect, spoke after Nero, and declared himself against capital
</p>
<p>punishment. The greater part of the senate, after he had finished,
</p>
<p>came over to his opinion, whereupon Cicero delivered his fourth

<p>Catilinarian oration, in which he took a view of the v/hole debate, and
</p>
<p>recommended prompt and vigorous measures. His efforts, however,

</p>
<p>were unsuccessful, and a large majority of the senators, and among
</p>
<p>them Cicero's own brother, Quintus, were disposed to side with
</p>
<p>Caesar, probably from the fear lest severer measures might prove
</p>
<p>injurious afterwards to Cicero himself. At last, Lutatius Catulus,
</p>
<p>Caesar's inveterate foe, and Cato, who was then tribune of the com-
</p>
<p>mons elect, interposed their efforts. The eloquence of the latter
</p>
<p>proved triumphant, and the course he recommended was almost
</p>
<p>unanimously adopted. (The authorities to be consulted on this
</p>
<p>subject are as follows : Plutarch, Vit. Cic. c. 20 et 21,  id, Vif.

<p>Appian, B. C. 2, 5, seqq.) As regards the phrase, jpedihts in "I f)^,
</p>
<p>sententiam ire, which is given in the text, we may remark, that a
</p>
<p>decree of the senate was commonly made by a separation of the
</p>
<p>senators to different parts of the house. He who presided said.
</p>
<p>" Let those who are of such an opinion pass over to that side,"
</p>
<p>pointing to a certain quarter, " and those who tliink differently, to
</p>
<p>this." Hence ire pedibus in sententiam alicujus means, " to aoree
</p>
<p>to any one's opinion," since he who had first proposed the opinion, or
</p>
<p>who had been the principal speaker in favour of it, passed over first,
</p>
<p>and the rest followed.

<p>15. Sed Caesar. The speech which Sallust here assigns to
</p>
<p>Caesar, and which, from the term hujuscemodi, as used by the his-
</p>
<p>torian, must be regarded as Caesar's merely in its general and
</p>
<p>leading features, is a perfect masterpiece of its kind : cool, argu-
</p>
<p>mentative, specious, and breathing apparently a spirit of patriotism,
</p>
<p>which was calculated to carry with it the opinions and feelings of a
</p>
<p>large majority of his hearers. It required all the bold and fervid
</p>
<p>eloquence of Cato to counteract its pernicious tendency.
</p>
<p>16. Ah odio, amicitia, &c. This construction of vgxuus with
</p>
<p>the preposition, is not unusual in the best writers, such as Cicero,
</p>
<p>Tacitus, &c. Compare, in the 14th chapter of this same narrative,

<p>deserved, but merely took from them the portions of Lycia and

<p>Caria which they had previously bestowed. Aulus Gcllius (7, 3)
</p>
<p>supplies us with some fragments of a very beautiful oration which
</p>
<p>Cato the elder delivered in their behalf.

<p>5. Per mducias. " During the season of truce."

</p>
<p>than a regard for your ov/n dignity, and that you may not listen
</p>
<p>more to the dictates of resentment than to what your own character
</p>
<p>demands."
</p>
<p>9. Novum consilium. " The novel measure which has been
</p>
<p>proposed," viz. of putting citizens to death in violation of the laws.
</p>
<p>Cicero, however, (4, in Cat. 4,) says that Silanus had reminded the
</p>
<p>senate "hoc genus poenae saepe in im.prolios civ es mxe'^xMicd, esse
</p>
<p>usurpatum."

<p>10. Omnium ingenia exsuperat. " Transcends the imaginations
</p>
<p>of all."  lis. " Those forms of punishment." Understand poenis.
</p>
<p>Caesar, here, with admirable art, seeks -to deduce an argument, in
</p>
<p>favour of a mild infliction of punishment, from the very enormity
</p>
<p>of the crime itself.

<p>fluous, as the crime speaks for itself, and cannot be aggravated by
</p>
<p>any powers of description. The true course for the senate to pursue
</p>
<p>is, according to him, to guard against any undue severity of punish-
</p>
<p>ment, both because it may expose them to the animadversion of
</p>
<p>posterity, and may furnish those coming after them with a danger-
</p>
<p>ous precedent. Hence he artfully urges the propriety of lenient

<p>measures.

</p>
<p>becomes us neither to show favour nor hatred, but, least of ail,

<p>5. Ultra. " After this ;" i. e. beyond the grave. The doctrine
</p>
<p>advocated by Caesar in the text, and which corresponded so inti-
</p>
<p>mately with his life and actions, was one unhappily but too preva-
</p>
<p>lent in the ancient world. Cicero makes mention of this opinion of
</p>
<p>Caesar with regard to the soul, in his fourth oration against Cati
</p>
<p>line ; and Cato also alludes to it in the following speech.

<p>Laeca, a tribune of the commxons, A. U. C. 454, ordained that no

<p>of Papirius Carbo and the younger Marius, A. U. C. 671. As a

<p>and then refers to the vigilance of the magistrate in marking offences J QQ
</p>
<p>committed. In this case there is often an application of the prepo-
</p>

<p>more strongly the steady attention directed towards the conduct
</p>
<p>found to be reprehensible. HilVs Syno7iyms, p. 89.
</p>
<p>7. Hanc ego caussam, 6cc. The train of reasoning which is here
</p>
<p>ascribed by the historian to Caesar, would appear to be as follows :
</p>
<p>Our forefathers, though they wanted neither sagacity in devising
</p>
<p>plans for their own advantage, nor boldness in carrying those plans
</p>
<p>into operation, yet never disdained to imitate, in the institutions of
</p>
<p>other nations, what they conceived to be of utility to themselves.
</p>
<p>Among other things, they borrowed the custom of inflicting capital
</p>
<p>punishment on condemned citizens. As, however, they had adopted
</p>
<p>this from the Greeks at a period when it promised to be productive
</p>
<p>of salutary eflfects, so they changed it for a different course when
</p>
<p>positive evil was found to result. This was their latest alteration,
</p>
<p>and it being such, we, their descendants, should be guided in this
</p>
<p>instance by their wisdom, and pursue without any deviation the path
</p>
<p>they have marked oat for us, the more especially, as we acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge our inferiority to them in political foresight, and in the princi-
</p>
<p>ples of sound government.

<p>must therefore be rendered, " But my opinion is this."

<p>m the hall, (atrium,) around which were ranged the little images of

<p>the Lares. In such expressions as the present, care must be taken

<p>not to confound arae with the altars in public temples. Compare,
</p>
<p>on this head, the remark of Ernesti, {Clav. Cic. s. v. Ara.) " Arae

<p>et foci quum junguntur, cave putes, aras de templis, focos de aedibus

</p>
<p>17. Qui mihi atque animo meo, &c. Cortius considers mihi
</p>
<p>atqiie animo meo equivalent simply to meo animo. The meaning

<p>of the clause will then be :  " I, who never extended to my own

<p>self indulgence for any fault, was not easily induced to pardon the

<p>misdeeds of others, for the sake of gratifying their ruling propen-

<p>habit of pardoning, as expressed by the imperfect tense. Plutarch's

<p>biography of Cato v/ill furnish an ample commentary on the words
</p>
<p>of the text. The stern and unbending character of this remarkable

<p>5. Ne, ista vohis^ &c. " Yes, that clemency and compassion,
</p>
<p>should they take up arms, will change into misery for you." Ne is
</p>
<p>an archaism for nae, from the Greek vai. Ista denotes strong con-
</p>
<p>tempt. With vertet understand se.
</p>
<p>6. Scilicet res asjiera est, &c. *'The crisis is undoubtedly a

</p>
<p>acknowledge, very probably, that the present posture of our affairs
</p>
<p>is a dangerous one, but you will assert, at the same time, that it fills
</p>
<p>vou with no alarm. Your assertion is a false one ; for the condition
</p>
<p>of the state does insphe you with apprehensions, and those, too, of
</p>
<p>the strongest kind, but you are too spiritless, too slothful, to act the
</p>
<p>part that becomes you.

</p>
<p>13. Nisi iterum, &lc. "Unless this be the second time that he

</p>
<p>extremely severe. Some commentators suppose, that the allusion in
</p>
<p>the text is to his having taken part with Marius in the contest be-
</p>
<p>tween him and Sylia. It is more probable, however, that the orator

<p>IS made to refer to the conspiracy of Piso, mentioned in chapter 18

<p>was not from any hostile intent that they harboured these designs
</p>
<p>against their country. Oh ! no ; but from mere want of reflection.
</p>
<p>Their conduct has always been marked by inconsiderateness and
</p>
<p>haste.

</p>
<p>were implicated, and betrayed the deliberations of the senate to the

<p>conspirators.

</p>
<p>2. Virtiitem animi. " His firmness of soul."
</p>
<p>3. Sicuti ille censuerat. The decree of the senate is said to
</p>
<p>have been made in accordance with the opinion of Cato, not because
</p>
<p>he was the only one who spoke in favour of capital punishment, but
</p>
<p>because he advocated that measure with the most ability and zeal.
</p>
<p>Thus Cicero {Ep. ad. Att. 12, 21) remarks, " Cur ergo in sentcn-

</p>
<p>Sallust is highly censurable for the silence which he preserves re-
</p>
<p>specting the public honours that were paid to Cicero on this occasion.
</p>
<p>" It is in the conclusion of the business," observes Mr. Duniop,
</p>
<p>" that the historian withholds from Cicero his due share of applause,
</p>
<p>and contrives to eclipse him by always interposing the character of
</p>
<p>Cato ; though it could not be unknown to any witness of those
</p>
<p>transactions, that Cato himself, and other senators, publicly hailed
</p>
<p>the consul as the Father of his country, and that a thanksgiving to
</p>
<p>the gods w-as decreed in his name, for having preserved the city
</p>
<p>from conflagration and the citizens from massacre. This omission,
</p>
<p>which may have originated partly in enmity, and partly in disgust
</p>
<p>at the ill-disguised vanity of the consul, has in all times been re-
</p>
<p>garded as the chief defect, and even stain, in the history of the

<p>8. Genus, ''Birth." M. Porcius Cato, called, after his death, \\2
</p>
<p>Uticensis, from the city of Utica, near Carthage, where he
</p>
<p>ended his existence, was the great grandson of IvI. Porcius Cato,
</p>
<p>the censor. The Porcian gens was plebeian ; the Julian, patrician ;
</p>
<p>illustrious achievements, however, and public honours, had raised
</p>
<p>the former to a full equality with the !iatter.

<p>10. Gloiia, Understand ;?a7'. ^

<p>11. Alia alii. " One kind of glory to the one, another to the

<p>altera alteri, which last would be too limited in signification for the
</p>
<p>spirit of the passage. Compare Livy, 1, 21, "i/a duo deinceps

<p>observes Mr. Dunlop, " is one of the most celebrated passages in
</p>
<p>the history of the conspiracy. Of both these famed opponents we
</p>
<p>are presented with favourable likenesses. Their defects are thrown
</p>
<p>into the shade : and the bright qualities of each different species, by
</p>
<p>w^hich they were distinguished, are contrasted for the purpose of
</p>
<p>showing the various qualities by which men arrive at eminence."
</p>
<p>Dunlop' s Roman Literature, vol. 2, p. 160, Land. ed. Steele has
</p>
<p>given a-ii imitation of this passage of Sallust, in the Christian Hero,

<p>lowest rank. They were likewise called Tresmri or Trevin. From

<p>Valerius Maxim us, (5, 4, 7,) it appears that they acted commonly

<p>by deputies.

<p>8. Locus  quod, &:c. The relative here agrees in gender with
</p>
<p>the following noun. Some grammarians term this the Greek con-
</p>
<p>struction. It is the usual practice of Cicero ; but other authors give
</p>
<p>the relative the gender of the preceding noun : Cicero himseli adopts
</p>
<p>this latter custom when the word explained is a foreign one : as,
</p>

</p>
<p>has also the following : " consensus quumavjjL-dOsiav Graeci vointy

</p>
<p>9. Tullianum. The prison at Rome was originally built by
</p>
<p>Ancus Martius, and afterwards enlarged by Servius Tullius ; whence
</p>
<p>that part of it which w^as under ground, and built by him, received
</p>
<p>the name of Tulhanum. Thus Varro (L. L. 4) observes, " In hoc,
</p>
<p>pars quae suh terra Tullianum, ideo quod additum a Tullio rege.'''
</p>
<p>The fall expression is Tullianum robur, from its walls having been
</p>
<p>originally of oak ; but in the days of Sallust they w^ere of stone.
</p>
<p>This dungeon now serves as a subterranean chapel to a small church
</p>
<p>built on the spot, called San P'ietro in career e, in commemoration
</p>
<p>of St. Peter, who is supposed to have been confined there. Its only
</p>
<p>entrance, when a dungeon, was through a hole in the arched roof;
</p>
<p>now, however, there is a door in the side-wall. *' Notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the change," observes Eustace, " it has still a most appalling ap-
</p>
<p>pearance." EuMace Class. Tour, yo\. 1, p. 365, note. Lmid. ed.

<p>10. Escenderis. An archaism for ascenderis. Some editions
</p>
<p>have descenderis, but erroneously , for escenderis refers to the eleva-
</p>
<p>tion on which the prison stood. Compare Descrizzione di Roma
</p>
<p>Antica, p. 151, where the different opinions are stated relative to

</p>
<p>regular complement of each legion ; still, however, he divided what 113
</p>
<p>men he had into twenty cohorts, ten for a legion, and these cohorts
</p>
<p>be siibdivided into maniples and centmies. The cohorts, maniples,
</p>
<p>and centuries, all wanted at first their regular complement of men,
</p>
<p>and only obtained it gradually as fresh troops arrived at the
</p>
<p>camp.
</p>
<p>17. Numero hominum. *' With the regular number of men." .
</p>
<p>The legion, as has already been remarked in the Notes to the Jugur-
</p>
<p>thine War, contained different numbers of men at different times,
</p>
<p>from 3000 to 6000. In the time of Polybius it was 4200. The
</p>
<p>subject is well discussed by Lipsius, De Militia Romana, dial. 4.
</p>
<p>Each legion was divided into ten cohorts, each cohort into three
</p>
<p>maniples, and each maniple into two centuries. So that there were
</p>
<p>thirty maniples and sixty centuries in a legion, and if there always
</p>
<p>had been 100 men in each century, as its name imports, the legion
</p>
<p>would have consisted of 6000 men.

</p>
<p>ascertained. Servius (^ad Aen. 11, 6S2) describes it as follows :

</p>
<p>recurvum.''^ Festus observes, " Spara parvissimi generis jacula,

</p>
<p>derstood : if rupes, it is the nominative to erat understood. The
</p>
<p>meaning, however, is the same in either case.

<p>5. Reliqua signa, &c. " The rest of his forces he stations m
</p>
<p>closer order, as a body of reserve." Signa, which properly denotes
</p>
<p>the standards, is here put by metonymy for the troops themselves.
</p>
<p>Each century, or at least each maniple, had its proper standard and
</p>
<p>standard-bearer.

<p>6. Ab his centuriones, &c. We have given lectos with Cortius
</p>
<p>and others. Some editions have electos, which may be construed
</p>
<p>as a substantive. The electi, according to Vegetius, (2, 6,) com-
</p>
<p>posed the first cohort, which took its post by the eagle, and was r<^-
</p>
<p>garded as the head of the legion, {caput legioiiis.) The Bipont
</p>
<p>edition reads electos.
</p>
<p>7. Evocatos. The evocati, as has abeady been remarked in the
</p>
<p>notes to Jugurtha, were veterans who had served out their time,
</p>
<p>bat had been prevailed upon to follow the standard of a commander
</p>
<p>whom they approved. They were exempi^ed from the drudgery of
</p>
<p>military service.
</p>
<p>8. Faesulanum queiidam. *' A certain inhabitant of Faesulae."
</p>
<p>Plutarch calls him Furius.  Curare. " To take command." Curare
</p>
<p>appears to be the proper v^ord on such occasions. Compare Jug.

<p>12. Pedibus aeger. Dio Cassius informs us that Antonius
</p>
<p>feigned illness on the day of battle, fearful of encountering the re-
</p>
<p>proaches of Catiline in case the latter should meet him in the fight.
</p>
<p>Catiline, according to the same authority, preferred coming to an
</p>
<p>engagement with the forces of Antonius rather than with those of
</p>
<p>Metellus, although the former commander had the larger army of the
</p>
<p>two, because he hoped that Antonius would purposely mismanage
</p>
<p>matters during the fight. Dio. Cass. 37, 39, vol. 1, p. 136, ed.

</p>
<p>and ille in the preceding clause, with reference to the same person.

<p>Petreio permittit. Hie Petreius, &c., (" that ofncer ;") and again,

<p>the Roman state. It may not be amiss, before concluding, to mention.
</p>
<p>a few particulars which are passed over in silence by the historian.
</p>
<p>From Dio Cassius, Lib. 37, c. 40 and 41, we learn, that Antonius, after
</p>
<p>the battle, sent the head of Catiline to Rome, in ordei to quiet all ap-
</p>
<p>prehension on the part of the inhabitants ; and that he himself was
</p>
<p>honoured with the title of Imperator, although he had taken no active part
</p>
<p>in the .fight, and although the number of slain (3000) was less than

<p>that for which this title was usually awarded, (5000.) A public thanks-
</p>
<p>giving was also decreed, and the garb of mourning, which the citizens
</p>
<p>had assumed when the conspiracy broke out, was again laid aside. The
</p>
<p>accomphces of Catiline, wlio had either not been present in the battle,
</p>
<p>or had escaped from the field, spread themselves over Italy, but were
</p>
<p>in part taken and executed. One of the number, Lucius Vettius,
</p>
<p>turned informer against the rest : but he accused so many as to excite
</p>
<p>the suspicion of the senate, who ordered him, not to commit to writing
</p>
<p>the names of those against whom he informed, but to mention them at
</p>
<p>once by word of mouth. This confused and alarmed him, and but few
</p>
<p>were subsequently accused. The names of those whom he had impli-
</p>
<p>cated having been concealed from the people at large, great confusion
</p>
<p>and alarm consequently prevailed. To quiet this general feeling of in-
</p>
<p>security, the senate resolved to publish the names in question, which
</p>
<p>was accordingly done. Some of the accused stood trial and were con

<p>Aborigines. A name given by the Roman writers to the primitive
</p>
<p>irace of the Latins. According to Cato, they dwelt originally about
</p>
<p>mount VelinOf in Italy, and the lake of Celano, (Fucinus,) as far as Car-
</p>
<p>seoh, and towards E,eate ; but were driven onward by the Sabines, who
</p>
<p>came from Aquiia. {Dion. Hal. 2, 49.) On leaving this vicinity, thev
</p>
<p>came down the Anio, and expelled the Siculi from the neighbourhood
</p>
<p>of Tibur, Antemns, Crustumerium, and Aricia. Sallust represents them
</p>
<p>as a savage race, living in hordes, without any civilization, and ignorant
</p>
<p>of agriculture. This, however, does not agree with the traces of their
</p>
<p>towns in the Apennines. The Aborigines revered Janus and Saturn ;
</p>
<p>the latter of whom, according to some authorities, taught them hus-
</p>
<p>bandly, and induced them to choose settled habitations. From this
</p>
<p>ancient race, blended with a remnant of the Siculi, came the later Jjatiii
</p>
<p>nation. (Compare Niebukr^ Rom. Hist.^ vol. i., p. 62. Cambridge

<p>Aegyptus. An extensive country of Africa, consisting of the long

<p>and narrow valley which follows the course of the Nile, from Syene
</p>

</p>
<p>ing from this point, to the Mediterranean sea. Sallust and Pomponius
</p>
<p>Mela (1,8) consider it as a part of Asia, m.aking Africa end at the

<p>Catabathm_us. Other ancient writers give the Nile as forming the divi-

</p>
<p>half to the former continent and half to the latter. . . p. 14.
</p>
<p>Aethiopes. a race, according to Sallust, occupying the central parts
</p>
<p>of Africa, from east to west. The early Greeks meant by Aethitpes all
</p>
<p>races of a dark complexion (aWo), uro, and ojxp, vulius,) and called their
</p>
<p>country Aethiopia, wherever situated. Hence, Homer speaks of the
</p>
<p>Ea-stern and Western Aethiopians, meaning by the former the Arabians,
</p>
<p>Indi, &c., and by the latter the natives of central Africa. Aetliiopia,
</p>
<p>according to the more definite account of Herodotus, includes the coun-
</p>
<p>tries above Eg\^pt, the present Nubia and Abyssinia ; and it is in some-
</p>
<p>what the same sense that the term is now employed, when we speak of

<p>Europe and Asia, including Africa in Europe. In general, Africa was
</p>
<p>reckoned a third part. The name was first applied by the Romans to
</p>
<p>the immediate territories of Carthage. Hence, we find, on the coast of
</p>
<p>the Mediterranean, Africa Propria, corresponding to the modern country
</p>
<p>of Tunis. On the east, Africa is bounded by the isthmus of Suez, and
</p>
<p>the Sinus Arabicus, or Red sea ; on the north by the Mediterranean,
</p>
<p>called by the Romans Mare Nostrum ; on the west by the Atlantic ; ami
</p>
<p>on the south by the Indian ocean. It is extremely doubtful wliether the
</p>
<p>ancients were acquainted with the circumnavigation of Africa. Hero-
</p>

<p>out by the orders of Necho, king of Egypt. . . p. 12, 13, 14-

<p>bank of the Rhodanus, thirteen miles belov/ Lugdunum, or Lyons. They
</p>
<p>were finally reduced beneath the Roman sway by Fabius Maximus, who
</p>
<p>hence was honoured with the surname of Allobrogicus. Their name is

<p>said to mean " Highlanders," from Al, " high," and Broga, " land."

<p>countiy the appellation of lapygia. It must be remarked, however, that
</p>
<p>the term lapygia was confined at first to that peninsula, to which the name
</p>
<p>Messapia was sometimes applied ; but we find, at a later period, that
</p>
<p>Polybius gives to lapygia the same extension which the Roman geogra-
</p>
<p>phers and historians assign to Apulia. The modern name of Apulia is

<p>divided into Armenia Major and Minor. The first of these answers to

<p>the modern Turcomania, and is still sometimes called Armenia, lying
</p>
<p>south of mount Caucasus, and comprehending the Turkish pachalics of
</p>
<p>Erze-Roum, Kars, and Van, and also the Persian province Iran, or
</p>
<p>Erivan. It was separated from Armenia Minor by the river Euphrates.
</p>
<p>Armenia Minor was, properly speaking, a part of Cappadocia. It is
</p>
<p>now called Aladulia, or Pegian. Armenia Major is a rough, mountain-
</p>
<p>ous country, which has Caucasus for its northern boundary, and in the
</p>
<p>centre is traversed by branches of mount Taurus, to which belongs
</p>
<p>mount Ai'arat. Here the rivers Euphrates, Tigris, and Cyrus, cr Kur,
</p>
<p>take their rise. The climate is rather cold than warm ; the soil in

<p>general moderately fertile, and better fitted for grazing than for agricul-
</p>

<p>by the name of Arpino. It was famous for having been the birth-

<p>Arretinus Ager. The territory of Arretium, a city of Etruria,
</p>
<p>north of Cortona, and near the Arnus, or Arno. Its modern name is
</p>
<p>Arezzo. Arretium was a place of considerable celebrity, and penerallv
</p>
<p>considered as one of the principal states of Etruria. It was much cele-
</p>
<p>brated for its terra cotta vases. (Pltn. H. N. 35, 12.) . p. 97.

<p>Asia. One of the divisions of the ancient w^orld. (Vid. Africa.)
</p>
<p>The name of Asia was applied by Homer, Herodotus, and Euripides, to
</p>
<p>a district of Lydia, watered by the Cayster. As their geographica,
</p>
<p>knowledge of the continent increased, the Greeks extended the term
</p>
<p>gradually to the whole of Asia Minor, and eventually to the other ex-
</p>
<p>tensive countries of the East. When the Roman writers refer to Asia

<p>specially, they mean the Roman province in Asia ?.linor. . p. 13, 85.

<p>Baleares. a name anciently given to the islands of Majorca and

<p>Minorca. The word is derived from the Greek 0d\\eiv, " to throw,"
</p>
<p>or " strike," from the expertness of the inhabitants in the use of the
</p>
<p>sling. The Romans obtained some of their best slingers from thes?
</p>
<p>islands. In Majorca is Palma, which still retains its ancient name. Iii

<p>Minorca is Portus Magonis, now Port Mahon. ... p. 72.
</p>
<p>Bruttii. a people of Magna Graecia, below Lucania. They were
</p>
<p>a pastoral race, and, according to some of the ancient writers, were called
</p>
<p>Bruttii by the Romans, from their cowardice in submitting to Hannibal
</p>
<p>during the second Punic war. A nmch better etymology, however, is
</p>
<p>given by Strabo, who informs us, that they were called Bruttii from the
</p>
<p>circumstance of their being revolted slaves ; Bpsrriovg yap KoXovcn dTcoGrd-
</p>
<p>rag, says Strabo, speaking of the Lucanians. This appellation the in-
</p>
<p>surgents are supposed to have accepted as a term of defiance. The

<p>Bruttii flocked eagerly to the victorious standard of Hannibal, and sub-
</p>
<p>sequently enabled that commander to maintain his ground in this quarter
</p>
<p>of Italy, when all hope of final success seemed to be extinguished.
</p>
<p>Hence they were reduced by the Romans to the most abject state of
</p>
<p>dependance, after the departure of the Carthaginian general and the

</p>
<p>origin which Sallust ascribes to Capsa, its having been founded, namely,
</p>
<p>by the Lvbian Hercules, assimilates it to the cities of Eg)^pt, and points
</p>
<p>to a sacerdotal colony. Even its other name, Hecatompylos, reminds
</p>
<p>us of Eg:\^tian Thebes and its hundred gates. {Mannert, Geogr., vol. x.,

<p>Capua. ' The capital of Campania in Italy, a rich and flourishing city
</p>
<p>until ruined by the Romans. Capua was originally called Yultumus,
</p>
<p>which name was changed by the Tyrrheni, after they became masters
</p>
<p>of the place, to Capua. This latter appellation was derived from their
</p>
<p>leader Capys, who, according to Festus, was so called from his feet
</p>
<p>being deformed and turned inward. Capua opened its gates to Hanni-
</p>
<p>bal after the battle of Cannae, and the luxury of the city proved highly
</p>
<p>injurious to the martial sphit of his troops. After the retreat of the
</p>
<p>Carthaginian general, this place surrendered at discretion to the Romans,
</p>
<p>who butchered the senators, condemned the nobles to perpetual impris-
</p>
<p>onment, and sold the inhabitants as slaves. Although colonies were
</p>
<p>afterwards sent to inhabit this city, it never regained its former magnin-
</p>
<p>cence. Genseric, the Vandal, in a later age, put the people to the
</p>
<p>sword, and burnt the city. Narses, in the reign of Justinian, perceiving
</p>
<p>the advantages of its situation, rebuilt Cap^a about the middle of the
</p>
<p>sixth century. It was destroyed, how^ever, by the Saracens, A. D. 341.
</p>
<p>Modern Capua occupies the site, not of the ancient city, but of Casili-
</p>
<p>num, on the Vuiturnus, 19 stadia distant ; the inhabitants having been
</p>
<p>transferred to the latter place by the bishop Landalpus and the Lombard
</p>
<p>count Lando. The village of St. Maria marks the true site of the
</p>
<p>ancient place. (Mannert, Geogr. vol. ix, part 1, p. 771.) . p. 94.

<p>Carthago. A celebrated commercial city of iifrica, the rival, for a
</p>
<p>long period, of the Roman power. It was founded by a colony from
</p>
<p>Tyre, according to the common account, B. C. 878. Some, however,
</p>
<p>suppose that the city was more than once founded, and rebuilt or en-
</p>
<p>larged, and in this way they seek to remove the difficulty occasioned by
</p>
<p>the conflicting accounts respecting the foundation of this city, by refer-
</p>
<p>ring them to different epochs. (Hei/ne, Excurs. 1. ad Aen. 4.) li\
</p>
<p>this point of view-, the third founding of Carthage w-ill be assigned to
</p>
<p>Dido. The Greeks called Carthage KaoY'yr'cov, and the inhabitants
</p>
<p>1^aoy7)c6vioi. The name of the city in Panic was Carthada, or Cartha-
</p>
<p>Hadath, i. e. the " New Cuy, "in contra-distinction, perhaps, to the old
</p>
<p>or parent city of Tyre ; unless, perhaps, the term refer rather to the
</p>
<p>renovation of an earlier city by the arrival of a new colony, which will
</p>
<p>agree w-ith the theory of the several foundings of Carthage. Carthage
</p>
<p>was situated on a peninsula, in the recess of a spacious bay, formed by
</p>
<p>the promontory Hermaeum (cape Bo7i) on the east, and that of Apollo
</p>
<p>(cape Zibh) on the west. The river Bagradas fiovv^s into the bay be-
</p>
<p>tvreen the remains of Utica and the peninsula ; and, being an inundating
</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHICAL IXDEX. 299
</p>
<p>nver, has dDubtless caused, many changes in the bay. The circumfer*
</p>
<p>ence of the site of Carthage was twenty- three mijes, and when it wag
</p>
<p>set on fire by the Romans, at the close of the third Punic war, it burnt
</p>
<p>incessantly for seventeen days. It is unnecessary here to enter very
</p>
<p>fully mto the history of this pow^erful city. The wars w^aged between
</p>
<p>it and the Romans were denominated the Punic, and were three in
</p>
<p>number. The first Punic war continued tw^enty-tliree years, and w^as
</p>
<p>terminated by the defeat of the Carthaginians off the Aegades Insulas.
</p>
<p>The second lasted about seventeen years, during nearly sixteen of which
</p>
<p>Hannibal was in Italy. It w-as ended by the battle of Zama. The third
</p>
<p>was nothing more than the capcui-e and destruction of Carthage. Julius
</p>
<p>Caesar planted a small colony on the ruins of Carthage. Augustus sent
</p>
<p>3,000 men thither, and built a city at a small distance from the spot on
</p>
<p>which the ancient place had stood, thus avoiding the ill effects of the
</p>
<p>mprecations, w-hich had been pronounced by the Romans, according to
</p>
<p>custom, at the time of its destruction, against those who shoujd rebuild
</p>
<p>it. This later Carthage was taken by Genseric, A. D. 439, and it was
</p>
<p>for more than a century the seat of the Vandal power in Africa. It w^as
</p>
<p>at last destroyed by the Saracens, during the Caliphate of Abdel Melek,
</p>

</p>
<p>guish it from a similar declivity of less extent farther to the east, along

<p>countries, entered and overran Gaul, and defeated four Roman armies
</p>
<p>m succession. IMarius, at last, in his second consulship, was chosen to
</p>
<p>rry on the war. He met the Teutones at Aquae Sextiae, in Gaul, and,
</p>
<p>after a bloody engagement, left 20,000 of the enemy dead on the field
</p>
<p>of battle, and took 90,000 prisoners. The Cimbri, who had formed
</p>
<p>another army, had already penetrated into Italy, where they were met at
</p>
<p>the river Atbesis by Marius and his colleague Catulus, a year after. An
</p>
<p>engagement ensued, and, if w^e believe the ancient accounts, 140,000
</p>
<p>were slain. Those w-ho escaped the sword of a\Iarius settled in that
</p>
<p>art of the Alps called Seiie Commune, where their descendants still
</p>
<p>retain the Teutonic language, and a traditional account of their origin.
</p>
<p>They keep themselves quite separate from the surrounding states,^ by
</p>
<p>which means they have preserved the language of their ancestors, in a
</p>
<p>great desfree, uncorrupt'ed. The late king of Denmark visited these
</p>
<p>Alpine Cimbrians, and readily conversed with them, when both partiesj
</p>
<p>speaking then* native languages, understood each other.

<p>CiRTA. A city of Numidia, about forty-eight miles from the sea, on
</p>
<p>a branch of the riVer Ampsagas. It w^as intended as the royal residence,

<p>300 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.
</p>
<p>and being, in fact, the only city originally in that part of the coimtry,
</p>
<p>and erected by Carthaginian workmen, it hence took the Panic name of
</p>
<p>Cartha, or, " the cit}'." It was the residence of S}'phax, I\Iasinissa, and
</p>
<p>the other rulers of the land. At a later period, Julius Caesar gave it to
</p>
<p>a certain Sittius, who aided him with his followers against Scipio and
</p>
<p>Juba. The place now changed its name to Sittianorum Colonia. In
</p>
<p>the time of the emperor Constantine, having suffered much on account
</p>
<p>of its fidehty to that prince, the latter repaired and embellished it, and
</p>
<p>gave it the name of CovMantino.. This name remains with a slight
</p>
<p>variation to the present day, and the small cit}^, built upon the ruins of

<p>the ancient capital is still caUed Cosantina. ... p. 16.

<p>Cketa. a large island in the Mediterranean, now Candia, said to
</p>

<p>close.
</p>
<p>Crotoxa, or Croto, now Cofrone. a powerful city of Magna Graecia,
</p>
<p>in the territory of the Bruttii, on the coast of the Sinus Tarentinus. It
</p>
<p>was distinguished for its attachment to the doctrines of the Pythagorean
</p>
<p>sect, and the consequent purity and morality of its inhabitants. Luxur}%
</p>
<p>and the love of pleasure, however, came in at last, and destroyed all the
</p>
<p>good effects which had emanated from the school of Pythagoras. Until
</p>
<p>jthis change took place, the Crotoniats were remarkable for their hardi-
</p>
<p>hood and vigour, and had conquered and destroyed the wealthy and
</p>
<p>effeminate city of Sybaris. As a proof, indeed, of the robust frames of
</p>
<p>its inhabitants, and their skill in athletic exercises, it was commonly
</p>
<p>said, that the last wrestler of Crotona was the first of the other Greeks.
</p>
<p>"When, however, the change took place in their owm morals, they degen-
</p>
<p>erated to such a decree, that, being engaged in hostilities with the
</p>
<p>Locrians, an army of 130,000 Crotoniats was routed by 10,000 of the
</p>
<p>enemy on the banks of the Sagra. After this, it gradually declined in
</p>
<p>importance, until the inhabitants, unable to hold out against Hannibal,

<p>retired to Locri, when the Romans estabhshed a colony in it. Pliny

<p>Etruria. a district of Italy, lying north and west of the Tiber.
</p>
<p>The origin of the Etrurian nation is unknow^n, although many, without
</p>
<p>any very strong reasons for the opinion, regard them as having been a
</p>
<p>Celtic race. Their civihzation came in with the Tyrrheni, who appear
</p>
<p>to have been identical with the Pelasgi. The statement of Herodotus,
</p>
<p>that the Tyrrheni, or Etrurians, were of Lydian origin, appears to refer
</p>
<p>merely to a Pelasgic emigration. The Etrurians excelled in the know-
</p>
<p>ledge of augury, and in the worship of the gods. In these respects the
</p>
<p>Romans seem to have done little more than adopt the ceremonies and
</p>
<p>institutions of their neighbours, who were for a long pciiod their de-
</p>
<p>termined and powerful enemies. After long continued war and much
</p>
<p>carnage, the Romans obtained a complete victory over them, and com-
</p>
<p>pelled them to submit to such conditions as they chose to dictate. The
</p>
<p>Etrurians were divided into twelve states, of which each adopted that
</p>
<p>form of government which seemed most agreeable, though the leading
</p>
<p>feature in all was aristocratic. The want of a common bond of union
</p>
<p>contributed very materially to their final subjugation by the Romans.

<p>The place, according to Sallust, was of Phoenician origin, and owed its-

<p>any harbour. It suffered severely in Caesar's wars, but was afterwards

<p>restored and enlarged by a colony being sent hither in the time of the

<p>Cisalpine Gaul, and lay along" the shores of the Sinus Ligusticus, or
</p>
<p>gulf of Genoa, between the Varus on the west, and the Macra on the
</p>
<p>east. The Ligures appear to have been a mumerous and powerful people,
</p>
<p>extending at an early period along the shores of the Mediterranean, from
</p>
<p>the mouth of the Rhodanus to that of the Amus, reaching also into the
</p>
<p>interior of Gaul, and the valleys of the maritime Alps. In the davs of
</p>
<p>kbe Roman dominion, however, their limits were contracted as first above

<p>stated. The Ligurians were a bold and hardy mountaineer-race, and
</p>
<p>they were not conquered by the Romans until after many years of war-
</p>
<p>fare. The possession of their country was important, as affording
</p>
<p>the easiest communication with Gaul and Spain over the maritime

</p>
<p>Macedonia. A country of Europe, lying to the west of Thrace, and
</p>
<p>north and northeast of Thessaly. It was reduced under the Roman
</p>
<p>sway by Paulus Aemihus, who defeated and took prisoner its last monarch
</p>
<p>Perses, in the memorable battle of Pydna. Before the time of Philip,
</p>
<p>father of Alexander, all the country beyond the river Strymon, and even
</p>
<p>the Macedonian peninsula, from Amphipolis to Thessalonica, belonged
</p>
<p>to Thrace, and Paeonia likewise on the north. But, when enlarged
</p>
<p>by conquest, the limits of Macedonia were from the river Nessus in
</p>
<p>Thrace to the Ionian sea, including Paeonia, and Illyria beyond lake
</p>
<p>Lychnitis. As a Roman province, however, Macedonia did not include
</p>
<p>Epirus. .......... p. 25.
</p>
<p>Massilia. a celebrated colony of the Phoceans, on the Mediter-
</p>
<p>ranean coast of Gaul, now Marseilles. It became at an earlv period a
</p>
<p>powerful and flourishing city, and v/as famed for its extensive commerce.
</p>
<p>The most prosperous period in its history would seem to have been the
</p>
<p>interval from the fall of Carthage, with which city it had frequent col-
</p>
<p>lisions, to the commencement of the contest between Caesar and Pom-
</p>
<p>pey. This city was always the firm ally of Rome. It suffered severely
</p>
<p>in the civil wars from its attachment to the party of Pompey, being
</p>
<p>compelled to sustain a severe siege, in which its fleet was destroyed,
</p>
<p>and, after surrendering, to pay a heavy exaction. Massilia became after-
</p>
<p>wards, in the days of Augustus, famous as a seat of science, and the
</p>
<p>rival of Athens. ........ p. 98.

<p>Mauretania. a country of Africa, lying to the west of Numidia,

<p>and answering now to the modern Fez and Morocco. It w^as, yjroperly

<p>NuMANTiA. A town of Spain, near the sources of the river Duriiis,
</p>
<p>celebrated for the brave resistance which it made against the Romans
</p>
<p>for the space of fourteen years. It was built upon an eminence of no
</p>
<p>great height, between two branches of the Durius, and surrounded by a
</p>
<p>very thick wood on three sides. One path alone led down into the
</p>
<p>plain, and this was defended by ditches and palisades. The great length
</p>
<p>of time it withstood the Rom.ans may be easily accounted for by its dif-
</p>
<p>ficult situation, and the circumstance of its circuit being so large, that
</p>
<p>within it were even pastures for cattle. The place was at last reduced
</p>
<p>by Scipio Africanus Minor, the conqueror of Carthage. The Numan-
</p>
<p>tines had withstood an army of 40,000 men with less than one fourth of
</p>
<p>that mnnber, and had not only hitherto held out, but frequently gained
</p>
<p>very considerable advantages over the enemy, and obliged them to ac-
</p>
<p>cede to dishonourable treaties. The remains of Numantia may be still
</p>
<p>seen near Puente de Don Garray. . . . . . p. 5.
</p>
<p>NuMiDiA. A country of iVfrica, east of Mauretania, and correspond-
</p>
<p>ing, in a great measure, to the modern Algiers. It was originally
</p>
<p>divided into two petty kingdoms, that of the Massyli to the east, and of
</p>
<p>the Massaesyli to the west, the line of separation between them being
</p>
<p>marked by the Tretum Promontorium, and a part of the river Ampsagas.
</p>
<p>Syphax was monarch of the Massaesyli, and Massinissa of the Massyli.
</p>
<p>The territory of Syphax v^^as bestowed upon Massinissa by the Romans,
</p>
<p>after the close of the second Punic war, and he was allowed to enjoy
</p>
<p>the possession of this until the day of his death. After the termination
</p>
<p>of the Jugurthine contest, the Romans appear to have taken no part
</p>
<p>of the kingdom of Numidia to themxselves, but to have distributed it
</p>
<p>among the different surviving branches of the royal line. In the civil
</p>
<p>wars between Caesar and Pompey, Juba, the great grandson of Massinissa,
</p>
<p>had the misfortune to espouse the side of the latter. After the victory of
</p>
<p>Thapsus, therefore, Caesar declared the whole kingdom of Numidia to
</p>
<p>be a Roman territory ; and Sallust, the historian, was sent thither as
</p>
<p>its governor. The western district around Cirta was at the same time
</p>
<p>bestowed upon Sittius in recompense for his services. Augustus be-

<p>Philenon Arae. Altars erected by the Carthaginians in memory

<p>of the brothers Phileni. They stood in the innermost bend of the Syrtis

</p>
<p>both the Syrtes. The story of the Phileni, as given by the historian,
</p>
<p>wears, to many, a very doubtful appearance, from the circmnstance of
</p>
<p>Gyrene's being so much nearer to the point in question than Carthage.
</p>
<p>If the distance between these two cities be divided into eight equal
</p>
<p>parts, the Phileni will be found to have travelled six, and the deputies
</p>
<p>from Cyrene only two, of these parts. The truth, how^ever, ap-
</p>
<p>pears to be, that the territory in dispute between the two powers, lay
</p>
<p>between Hesperis on the Cyrenean side, and Leptis Magna on the
</p>
<p>Carthaginian, and that the deputies started actually from these two
</p>
<p>points, not from Carthage and Cyrene. {Maiinert. Geogr.^ vol. x:,

<p>distance of about thirty-five geographical miles. The breadth was very
</p>

<p>of Florentia, on the Stella, which falls into the Ombrone, a northern
</p>
<p>branch of the Arnus, or Arno. Pliny {H. N. 3, 5) calls it Pistorium ;
</p>
<p>but Ptolemy and others give it the appellation of Pistoria. The modern
</p>
<p>name is Pistoia. This place is memorable from having witnessed in
</p>
<p>its vicinity the close of Catiline's desperate career. The spot on which
</p>
<p>the action was fought is too imperfectly marked by the concise narra-
</p>
<p>tive of Sallust to be now recognised. We may conjecture, however,
</p>
<p>that it was to the north of Pistoia, and near the modern road from that

<p>RhegTum. One of the most celebrated and flourishing cities of Magna
</p>
<p>Graecia, at the extremity of Italy, in the territory of the Bruttii. It is
</p>
<p>supposed to have been founded nearly 700 years B. C, by a party of
</p>
<p>Zancieans from Sicily, together with some Clialcidians, from Euboea,
</p>

<p>Rhodii. The people of the island of Rhodes. This celebrated island
</p>
<p>lay to the southwest of the coast of Caria, and about forty-three miles
</p>
<p>distant from the main land. Rhodes sided with the Roman power, and
</p>
<p>became a valuable auxiliary to their rising greatness. In return for the
</p>
<p>important services thus rendered, it received from its new friends the
</p>
<p>territories of Lycia and Caria ; but suspicion and distrust eventually
</p>
<p>arose, the Rhodians were deprived of their possessions in Asia, and, at
</p>
<p>last, in the reign of Yespasian, of their freedom. Rhodes was famed
</p>
<p>for its Colossus, or statue of the sun, the work of Chares, who spent
</p>
<p>twelve years in the execution. An earthquake threw it down after it
</p>
<p>had stood erect for sixty-six years. It remained in ruins for 894 years,
</p>
<p>until A. D. 672, vvhen the Saracens sold it to a Jewish merchant of
</p>
<p>Edessa, w^ho loaded 900 camels with the brass. . . p. 106.

<p>Roma. Of this celebrated city, it will be sufficient here to remark,
</p>
<p>that it stood on the southern bank of the Tiber, below the junction of
</p>
<p>that river and the Anio, and about fifteen miles from the sea. It was
</p>
<p>divided into twenty-four regions or wards, had seven great, and thirteen
</p>
<p>smaller, aqueducts, thirty-seven gates, and six hundred and forty-four
</p>
<p>towers on the walls. Its population, when greatest, did not proba-
</p>
<p>bly fall much below four millions. The seat of empire was transferred
</p>
<p>to Byzantium, by Constantino, A. D. 328 ; and Rome itself was taken
</p>
<p>by Odoacer, king of the Heruli, A. D. 476, which put an end to the

<p>east of Campania and the lower extremity of Latium. The Samnites
</p>
<p>were of Sabine origin, and famed for their valour, w^hich displayed itself
</p>
<p>in their long conflict with the Roman power. They only ceased to

<p>exist as a nation after their overthrow by Sylla. ... p. 108.
</p>
<p>Sicca. A city of Numidia, on the river Bagradas, and at some dis-
</p>
<p>tance from the coast. It was called Sicca Venerea, from a temple of
</p>
<p>Venus which it contained. Bochart and De Brosses derive the name
</p>
<p>of Sicca from the Punic Succoth Benoth, (i. e. " tabernacula puellarum,")
</p>
<p>and make Benoth ('^puella") the origin of the word Venus among the
</p>
<p>Romans. According to Shaw, the modern Koff stands near the site of
</p>
<p>the ancient city. This, however, is doubtful. . . . p. 39

<p>SiciLiA. A well-known island in the Mediterranean, separated from

<p>Passaro ; and the remaining one Lilybaeum, now Boeo. This last,
</p>
<p>however, is in tnUh not a mountain-promontory, but a low, flat point of
</p>
<p>land, rendered dangerous to vessels by its sand-banks and concealed
</p>
<p>rocks. Sicilia derived its name from the ancient Siculi, who came into

<p>SiDONii. The people of Sidon, in Phoenicia. This was the oldest,
</p>
<p>and, until eclipsed by its colony Tyre, the most powerful of the Phoeni-
</p>
<p>cian cities. The inhabitants appear to have acquired at an early period
</p>
<p>a pre-eminence in arts, manufactures, and commerce. The modern
</p>
<p>Saide is still a considerable town, but the harbour is nearly choked with
</p>
<p>sand. Sidon was about twenty- four miles north of TyTe. . p. 5i.
</p>
<p>SuTHUL. A town of Numidia, of which Sallust alone makes mention.
</p>
<p>M. Barbie du Bocage suspects that this town is the same with that called
</p>
<p>Sufetala (now Sbaitla) in the Itin. Ant. The name Suthul is said to
</p>
<p>signify "the town of eagles." ...... p. 27.
</p>
<p>Syrtes. The Syrtes were two bays or galfs on the coast of Africa,
</p>
<p>of which the one was called Syrtis Major, the other Syrtis Minor. The
</p>
<p>latter is now termed the gulf of Cabes, from the ancient city of Tacape,
</p>
<p>which stood at the head of it. It is about forty-five geographical mileaj
</p>
<p>in breadth, and runs up into the continent about seventy-five miles. It
</p>
<p>is opposite to the islands of Sicily and Malta, and was reckoned the
</p>
<p>more dangerous of the two. This gulf is still an object of apprehension
</p>
<p>to mariners, in consequence of the variations and uncertainties of the
</p>
<p>tides on a flat and shelvy coast. The Syrtis Major is about one hundred
</p>
<p>and eighty geographical miles between the two capes, and })enetrates one
</p>
<p>hundred miles into the land. The natives call it Syrte-al-Kibher, i. e.
</p>
<p>the Great Syrtis, and sailors, Si/dra, or Seedra. The name Syrtis is
</p>
<p>generally derived from the Greek avpM, " to drag," in allusion to the
</p>
<p>agitation of the sand by the force of the tides. (Compare Sallust,
</p>
<p>Jugurth. c. 78.) It is more than probable, howevec, that the appella-
</p>
<p>tion is to be deduced from the term Sert^ which still exists in Arabic as
</p>
<p>the name for a desert tract or region : for the term Syrtis does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear to have been confined to the mere gulfs themselves,. but to have

<p>Ad lERBAL. Son of Micipsa, and grandson of Masinissa, besieged at
</p>
<p>Cirta, and put to death by Jugurtha, after imploring in vain the aid of
</p>
<p>Rome, B. C. 112. Gesenias conjectures the origin of this proper
</p>
<p>name, from the Hebrew Addir, ('' great,") and Baal, (" lord.") Claudian

<p>Aemilius Scaurus. Vid. Scaurus.
</p>
<p>Albinus. Aulus Postumius, brother of Spurius Postumius Albinus,
</p>
<p>the consul, who obtained by lot Numidia for his province, B. C. 112.
</p>
<p>Aulus, and the Roman army entrusted to his care by his brother, were
</p>
<p>entrapped by Jugurtha, and compelled to pass under the yoke. The senate
</p>
<p>refused to ratify the treaty v^hich he made on this occasion with the
</p>
<p>Numidian monarch. Livy {Ep. 64) calls him lieutenant-general, not
</p>
<p>propraetor, the term applied by Sallust.
</p>
<p>iVLBiNus. Spurius Postumius, elected consul with M. Minucius Rufus,
</p>
<p>112 B. C; and who, in the allotment of the provinces, obtained Numi-
</p>
<p>dia, while his colleague got Macedonia. He appears to have been a com-
</p>
<p>mander of very inferior abihties, and was repeatedly foiled and baffled by
</p>
<p>Jugurtha. Being compelled to return to Rome, to attend the elections,
</p>
<p>he left his army in charge of his brother Aulus, whom Jugurtha entrapped
</p>
<p>and compelled to pass under the yoke. On returning to Africa, he was
</p>
<p>forced by the wretched state of the troops to remain inactive. In this
</p>
<p>condition he resigned the army to Metellus, who superseded him in the
</p>
<p>command.
</p>
<p>Annius, Lucius. A tribune of the commons, who made a vigorous
</p>
<p>effort to retain his office, after the expiration of his legal term. He was
</p>
<p>aided in this attempt by one of his colleagues, P. Licinius Lucullus, in
</p>
<p>opposition to the other tribunes ; and the struggles of these two prevented
</p>
<p>the election of the other magistrates during a whole year.
</p>
<p>Annius, Quintus. A man of senatorian rank, who entered into the
</p>
<p>conspiracy of Catiline. He effected his escape, when some of the ring-
</p>
<p>leaders were apprehended, and appears to have eluded the search of the
</p>
<p>g-gcnts of government, and to have gone unpunished.

<p>succeeded, commence, while in this high office, their plans of revolution
</p>
<p>Cicero defeated this scheme, and, being elected consal with Antonius fof
</p>
<p>his colleague, succeeded in detaching the latter from the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>from ever)'" other design fonned against the state. He effected this de-
</p>
<p>sirable object by yielding to Antonius the rich province of Macedonia,
</p>
<p>which had fallen to his own lot. In the action between the forces of
</p>
<p>Catiline and those of the republic, Antonius took no part, having been
</p>
<p>prevented, according to Sallust, by a complaint in his feet. Dio Cassius,
</p>
<p>however, states expressly, that he feigned illness on this occasion, through
</p>
<p>fear of encountering the reproaches of Catiline, in case they should meet
</p>
<p>in the fight. After the conspiracy was crushed, Antonius went to his
</p>
<p>province of Macedonia, where he continued for two years, but, on his
</p>
<p>return to Rome, he was brought to trial, and banished, for having been
</p>
<p>guilty of extortion, and having made war beyond the limits of his pro-
</p>
<p>vince, (Liv. Epit. 103.) He was a man of very dissolute habits, and
</p>
<p>before he obtained the consulship had been expelled by the censors from
</p>
<p>the senate for immoral conduct.
</p>
<p>AsPAR. A Numidian, sent to the court of Bocchus by Jugurtha, to
</p>
<p>obtain secret information respecting the intentions of the Mauretanian
</p>
<p>king with respect to himself and the Roman people. He was outwitted
</p>
<p>by Bocchus and Sylla, and the immediate consequence was the capture
</p>
<p>of Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>AuRELiA Oresttlla. A female of great beauty, but very corrupt prin-
</p>
<p>ciples. Catiline offered her his hand in marriage, which she refused to
</p>
<p>accept, because he had a son by a former marriage, arrived at man's
</p>
<p>estate. To remove this obstacle Catiline put his son to death by ad-
</p>
<p>ministering poison. (Compare VaL Max. 9, 1.)
</p>
<p>AuTEONius, P. A Roman of senatorian rank, who became consul
</p>
<p>elect, but afterwards lost the consulship on a charge of bribery. The
</p>
<p>conseqtient disgrace in which this involved him led him very probably to
</p>
<p>join the party of Catiline. After the overthrow of that party he succeeded
</p>
<p>in making his escape.

<p>Numidia against Jugurtha, where, however, he acquired no fame, but

<p>was led by his avaricious feelings to receive a heavy bribe, and conclude
</p>
<p>a disadvantageous and dishonourable peace with Jugurtha. He was

<p>condemned under the Mamilian lav/, and died in exile. Besides the

<p>Bomilcar. An officer in the army of Jugurtha, to whom he entrusted
</p>
<p>secret and important business. He conspired along with Nabdalsa
</p>
<p>against his master, but the plot was discovered and he lost his life.
</p>
<p>Brutus, D. Junius. The husband of Sempronia. His residence was
</p>
<p>near the forum, and into it Umbrenus took the ambassadors of the Allo-
</p>
<p>broges, and discovered to them the conspiracy of Catiline. From
</p>
<p>Sallust's mentioning that the meeting w^as held in his house vvhen Brutus
</p>
<p>was from home, the presumption is that he had no knowledge of tho
</p>
<p>ccnspiracy ; although his wife Sempronia was an accomplice.

<p>C.
</p>
<p>Caesar, C. Julius. Son of Caius Caesar, and Aureha the daughter of
</p>
<p>Cotta. He was born m the sixth consulship of Marius, B. C. 99. V/hen
</p>
<p>only in his seventeenth year, he obtained the office of Flamen Dialis or
</p>
<p>High-priest of Jupiter. His marriage with Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna,
</p>
<p>excited against him the hatred of Sylla, Vv'hose suspicion he had previously
</p>
<p>incurred from his aunt Julia's being the wife of Marius. He with difficulty
</p>
<p>escaped assassination, and it Vv^as only at the intercession of tlie vestal
</p>
<p>virgins, and in consequence of the entreaties of his relations, that Sylla
</p>
<p>spared his life. The latter, indeed, had the discernment to behold in
</p>
<p>him, even when a mere youth, the germes of future talent and ambition,
</p>
<p>and when he was asked by his friends why he was so anxious to put a
</p>
<p>mere boy to death, his answer was, " In that boy, I see many Mariuses." 
</p>
<p>Of the eventful hfe of this eminent Roman, it will only be necessary here
</p>
<p>to speak so far as it was connected with the conspiracy of Catiline. His
</p>
<p>principal aim, in the accomplishment of his ambitious schemes, was to
</p>
<p>gain the favour of the populace, and weaken the power of the nobility.
</p>
<p>This brought him at once in contact with Catiline, and, in favouring the
</p>
<p>views of that daring conspirator, his object was to destroy by these
</p>
<p>means the liberty of his country, and then to crush the conspirators
</p>
<p>themselves, and make himself master of Rom.e. The opinion which
</p>
<p>he gave in the senate, with respect to the punishment of Lentulus,

</p>
<p>Cassius. Vid. Longinus.
</p>
<p>Catilina, L. Sergius. A Roman of patrician rank, and the last of
</p>
<p>the gens Sergia. Of his father and grandfather little is known. The
</p>
<p>former w^ould seem to have been in indigent circumstances, from the
</p>
<p>language of Quintus Cicero, {de Pet. Cons. c. 2,) who speaks of Cati-
</p>
<p>line, as having been born amid the poverty of his father. The great
</p>
<p>grandfather, M. Sergius Silus, or Silo, distinguished himself greatly in
</p>
<p>the second Punic war, and was present in the battles of Ticinus, Trebia,
</p>
<p>Trasymenus, and Cannae. Pliny {H. N. 7, 29) speaks of his exploits
</p>
<p>in a very animated strain.  The cruelty of Catiline's disposition, his un-
</p>
<p>daunted resolution, and the depravity of his morals, fitted him for acting
</p>
<p>a distinguished part in the turbulent and bloody scenes of the period in
</p>
<p>which he lived. He embraced the interests of Sylla, in whose army he
</p>
<p>held the office of quaestor. That monster, in his victory, had in Catiline

<p>an able coadjutor, whose heart knew no sympathy, and his lewdness no

</p>
<p>bounds. He rejoiced in the carnage and plunder of the proscribed, grat-
</p>
<p>ifying at one time his own private resentments, by bringing his enen)ies
</p>
<p>to punishment, and executing at another the bloody mandates of the
</p>
<p>dictator himself. Many citizens of noble birth are said to have fallen
</p>
<p>by his hand, and, according to Plutarch, {Vit. Syll. c. 32.  Vit. Cic.
</p>
<p>c. 10,) he had assassinated his own brother during the civil war, and
</p>
<p>now, to screen himself from prosecution, persuaded Sylla to put him
</p>
<p>down among the proscribed, as a person still alive. He murdered, too,
</p>
<p>with his own hands, his sister's husband, a Roman knight, of a mild and
</p>
<p>peaceable character. One of the most horrid actions, however, of which
</p>
<p>he was guilty, would seem to have been the killing of M. Marius Grati-
</p>
<p>dianus, a near relation of the celebrated Marius. Sylla had put the namo
</p>
<p>of this individual on the list of the proscribed, whereupon Catiline en-
</p>
<p>tered the dwelling of the unfortunate m.an, exhausted upon his person
</p>
<p>all the refinements of cruelty and insult, and having at length put an end
</p>
<p>to his existence, carried his bloody head in triumph through the streets
</p>
<p>of Rom_e, and brought it to Sylla, as he sat on his tribunal in the forum.
</p>
<p>When this was done, the murderer washed his hands in the lustra! water
</p>
<p>at the door of Apollo's temple, which stood in the immediate vicinity. 
</p>
<p>Catiline was peculiarly dangerous and formidable, as his power of dis-
</p>
<p>simulation enabled him to throw a veil over his vices. Such was his
</p>
<p>art, that, while he was poisoning the minds of the Roman youth, he gained
</p>
<p>the friendship and esteem of the severe Catulus. The remainder of his
</p>
<p>career is detailed in the pages of Sallust, and will not need repetition here.
</p>
<p>Cato, J\i. -Porcius, surnamed Uticensis, on account of his having de-
</p>
<p>stroyed him.self at Utica, was the great grandson of Cato the Censor.
</p>
<p>His parents died when he was very young, and he was educated under
</p>
<p>the roof of his mother's brother, Livius Drusus. He v/as austere ia his
</p>
<p>morals, a strict follower of the tenets of the Stoic sect ; and so great a
</p>
<p>lover of Vv'liat was virtuous and right, as to pursue every object of such a
</p>
<p>nature Vv^ith undeviating steadiness, regardless of the difficulties whi^ii
</p>
<p>he might have to encounter, or of the dangers to which he might be e x-
</p>
<p>posed. Cato exerted himself, though in vain, to stem the torrent of
</p>
<p>Roman luxur}^ and corruption, and in his own person he copied the sirn

</p>
<p>plicity of earlier days. He often appeared barefooted in public, and
</p>
<p>never travelled but on foot. In whatever office he was employed, he
</p>
<p>always reformed its abuses, and restored the ancient regulations. To the
</p>
<p>quahties of a virtuous man, and the rectitude of a stern patriot, Cato
</p>
<p>added the intrepidity of a brave soldier and the talents of an able general.
</p>
<p>In the affair of the conspiracy, he gave Cicero his constant end vigoroug
</p>
<p>support, and it was chieliy through his efforts, in opposition to those of
</p>
<p>Caesar, that the accomplices of Ca4iline were capitally punished. This
</p>
<p>virtuous Rom.an put an end to his existence at Utica, after the defeat of
</p>
<p>Juba and Scipio by Caesar, in the battle of Thapsus.
</p>
<p>Catulus, Q. Lutatius. A noble Roman, conspicuous both for
</p>
<p>his love of country and his private virtues. He was the colleague of
</p>
<p>Marius in the consulship v/hen the Cimbri and Teutones came down
</p>
<p>upon the south of Europe, and was engaged with that commander in
</p>
<p>the bloody battle of the Raudii Campi, where the Cimbri were so sig-
</p>
<p>nally defeated by the Romans. We afterwards find him censor with
</p>
<p>Crassus ; and, subsequently to this, opposing Crassus's attempt to make
</p>
<p>Egypt tributary. Catulus was in politics on the aristocratic side, and
</p>
<p>HISTORICAL INDEX. 217
</p>
<p>of course a warm opponent of Julius Caesar. He was competitor also
</p>
<p>with the latter for the office of pontifex, but unsuccessful in his appHca-
</p>
<p>tion. At a later period he obtained the consulship along with M.
</p>
<p>Aemilius Lepidus, B. C. 80, and ten years after thi-s he dedicated the
</p>
<p>temple of Jupiter in the capitol, which had been destroyed by fire. The
</p>
<p>character of Catulus stood desen-edly high. A stranger to fiattery and
</p>
<p>adulation, he reproved with equal openiiess the levity of the multitude,
</p>
<p>and the misconduct of the senate. An anecdote is related of him by
</p>
<p>"Plutarch, which proves conclusively the estimation in which he vv^as held.
</p>
<p>When it was proposed to invest Pompey with extraordinary power, under
</p>
<p>the ManiHan lav^, for the suppression of the pirates, Catulus opposed the
</p>
<p>step, and one of his arguments was, that the people ought not to expose
</p>
<p>such a man to so many dangers as he was hkely to incur in this new
</p>
<p>command, " for," added he, " what other vvill you have if you lose him V
</p>
<p>"With one voice the assembled people exclaimed, "Yourself" After a
</p>
<p>long life of honourable usefulness, Catulus Vv^as compelled to put an end
</p>
<p>to his days, by order of the sanguinar}^ Marius. In order to effect this,
</p>
<p>he shut himself up in a narrow chamiber, nevv-ly plastered, and suffocated
</p>
<p>himself by the vapour produced by a large fiie.
</p>
<p>Cethegus, C. Cornelius. A Roman of corrupt morals and turbulent
</p>
<p>character. He filled, at one time, the office of tribune, and was also a.
</p>
<p>warm partisan of SyCa, after having originally sided with ^larius. Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently, hovvever, losing the influence which he had possessed, he
</p>
<p>joined in the conspiracy of Catiline. Cicero informs us, that in rash-
</p>
<p>ness and daring he surpassed Catiline himself, and almost equalled him
</p>
<p>in strength of body, love of arms, and dignity of birth. In arranging
</p>
<p>the details of the plot, the conspirators assigned to Cethegus the task of
</p>
<p>posting himself at the door of Cicero's house, and, after he had forced
</p>
<p>an entrance, of murdering that illustrious Roman. The vigilance of Cicero
</p>
<p>frustrated this design. Cethegus vvas apprehended along vath Lentulus
</p>
<p>and the rest, and strangled in prison.
</p>
<p>Cicero, M. Tullius. An eminent and well-known Roman, bom at
</p>
<p>Arpinum, a town cf the Yolsci, in Latium., B. C. 107. His father
</p>
<p>although of equestrian rank, had never enjoyed any curule ofiice, and,

</p>
<p>on that account, Cicero frequently calls himself "a new man," {novus
</p>
<p>homo,) as having been the first of his family who had raised himself to
</p>
<p>such a magistracy. After a careful education, in the completion of
</p>
<p>which he travelled over many parts of Greece, Cicero entered on the
</p>
<p>career of office, and it was his peculiar boast, to have obtained each pre-
</p>
<p>ferment in succession in its own proper year, or, in other words, as soon
</p>
<p>as he was eligible to it. Thus, he obtained the quaestorship at thirty-
</p>
<p>one years of age, the aedileship at thirty-seven, the praetorship at forty,
</p>
<p>and the consulship at forty-three. Our limits will compel us to confine
</p>
<p>ourselves merely to that part of Cicero's history which vvas connected with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy of Catiime, and only to so much even of this as Sallust
</p>
<p>himself has not touched upon. It vras a master stroke of policy on the
</p>
<p>part of Cicero to driv^e Catiline out of Rome, and force him, as it were,
</p>
<p>into a rebellion before it vras ripe, m the hope, that, by carrying out with
</p>
<p>him his accomplices, he would clear the city at once of the whole faction ;
</p>
<p>or, by leaving themx behind, without his counsels to guide them., would
</p>
<p>expose them, to sure destruction by their own rashness and folly. For
</p>
<p>Catiline's chief trust was not on the onen force which he had provided

<p>318 HISTORICAL INDEX.
</p>
<p>for the field, but on the success of his secret machinations at Rome, and
</p>
<p>on making himself master of the city.  While the sense of all his im-
</p>
<p>portant services was still fi'esh, Cicero was repaid with the most ample
</p>
<p>honours. L. Gellius, moreover, who had been consul and censor, said
</p>
<p>in a speech to the senate, that the republic owed him a civic crown,
</p>
<p>** for having saved them all from ruin," and Catulus, in a full house, de-
</p>
<p>clared him. " the father of his country," as Cato did likewise from tl>e
</p>
<p>rostra, with the loud acclamations of the whole people. Party feeliugs,
</p>
<p>however, eventually gained the ascendency, and the very man who had
</p>
<p>been thus idolized v/as impeached for putting citizens to death withoni
</p>
<p>the formality of a trial, and w^as compelled to yield to the coming storm,
</p>
<p>and retire into voluntary banishment. The individual most active against
</p>
<p>him was Publius Clodius. The charge against him had reference to the
</p>
<p>summary punishment inflicted by him, in accordance with the orders of
</p>
<p>the senate, on Lentulus, Cethegus, and their associates. Cicero display-
</p>
<p>ed a great want of firmness in exile, his fortitude deserted him, and his
</p>
<p>spirits sunk in deep depression. By the exertions of Pompey and the
</p>
<p>efforts of his other friends, aided by the active co-operation of the senate,
</p>
<p>he w^as finally recalled. The senate decreed their thanks to all the

<p>then declared themselves consuls, and the latter died on the very first
</p>
<p>day of his entering upon office. L. Valerms Flaccus succeeded him.
</p>
<p>In his third and fourth consulships Cinna had Cn. Papirius Carbo fot
</p>
<p>his colleague, with whom he made preparations for a war against Sylla,
</p>
<p>who was then engaged in the operations against Mithridates. During
</p>
<p>the fourth consulship of Cinna", Julius Caesar married his daughter Cor-
</p>
<p>nelia. Cinna eventually, after raising a powerful armament against
</p>
<p>Sylla, was killed by his own men, on a rumour of his having put Pompey,
</p>
<p>then quite a young man, to death.
</p>
<p>CosPARius, Q. A native of Terracina, and accomplice in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of Catiline. He was preparing to set out for Apulia, to rouse
</p>
<p>and arm the slaves against the state, at the tim^e the conspiracy was dis-
</p>
<p>covered. Having learned that the plot was detected, he fled from Rome,
</p>
<p>before the officers sent by the consuls to apprehend him arrived at his
</p>
<p>house, but was afterwards taken and strangled in prison.

<p>Cornelius, C. A Roman knight, connected wath the conspiracy of

<p>CoRNiFicius, Q. A Roman, to whose custody Cethegus was com-
</p>
<p>mitted, before he suffered punishment.
</p>
<p>Crassus, M. Licinius. A celebrated Roman, sumamed the " Rich,'
</p>
<p>on account of his great opulence. At first he was very circumscribed in
</p>
<p>his circumstances, but by educating slaves, and selling them for a high
</p>
<p>price, he soon enriched himself. Crassus distinguished himself in the
</p>
<p>war against Spartacus, by defeating that gladiator and killing 12000 of
</p>
<p>his followers. After this, he was chosen consul with Pompey, and, after
</p>
<p>the consulship, obtained the office of censor. His supposed participation
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy of Catiline was probably without any foundation in
</p>
<p>truth. What purpose could Crassus, in fact, propose to himself by en-
</p>
<p>tering into a plot to burn a city, in which his own property was so consid-
</p>
<p>erable "? The enmity which arose between Cicero and Crassus, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the alleged guilt of the latter, was so bitter, that, according
</p>
<p>to Plutarch, it would have shown itself by some act of violence on the
</p>
<p>part of Crassus, had not his, son Pablius, v/ho was very intimate with
</p>
<p>Cicero, prevented him. He even prevailed on his father, eventually, to
</p>
<p>become reconciled to the orator. Crassus became afterwards a member
</p>
<p>of the first triumvirate ; and, obtaining Syria for his province, marched
</p>
<p>against the Parthians, by whom he was defeated and slain.
</p>
<p>CuRius, Q. A Roman of good family, whose disgraceful and im-
</p>
<p>moral conduct had caused his expulsion oy the censors from the senate.
</p>
<p>He was connected with the conspiracy, but divulged the secret of such
</p>
<p>a conspiracy's having been formed, to Fuivia, a female of high rank,
</p>
<p>with whom he was intimate. Fuivia communicated the danger w^hich
</p>
<p>threatened the state and the lives of the citizens ; and the alarm w^hich
</p>
<p>this occasioned caused the election of Cicero to the consulship. Cicero
</p>
<p>subsequently prevailed upon Curius, through the means of Fuivia, to
</p>
<p>discover to him all the movements of Catiline, and was thus enabled to
</p>
<p>baffle his schemes. In return for these services, rewards were voted
</p>
<p>him from the public funds ; but Caesar, whom Curius had named among
</p>
<p>the conspirators, exerted himself against the fulfilment of the public
</p>
<p>promise, and the rewards were not given.

<p>tharf 500 jygera, or about 350 acres of land. The owners, however,

<p>brother, on the demise of his father, succeeded to the v/hole kingdom.

<p>Lentulus, P. Cornelius, surnamed Sura. A Roman nobleman,

</p>
<p>band, M. Antonius Creticus, to whom she had born M. Antonius, the
</p>
<p>triumvir. Lentulus was a man of talents, but extremely corrupt in his
</p>
<p>private character. The interest of his family, and the affability of his
</p>
<p>manners, proceeding from a love of popularity, raised him through the
</p>
<p>322 HisToracAL i.\dex.
</p>
<p>usual gradation of public honours to the ofnce of consul, which he ob-
</p>
<p>tained B. C. 73. in conjunction with Cn. Aufidius Orestis. Expelled from
</p>
<p>the senate on account of his immoral conduct, he had procured the prae-
</p>
<p>torship, the usual step for being again restored to that body, when'
</p>
<p>Catiline formed his design of subverting the government. Poverty, the
</p>
<p>natural consequence of excessive dissipation, added to immoderate vanity
</p>
<p>and extravagant ambition, induced him to join in the conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>soothsayers easily persuaded him that he was the third of the gens Cor-
</p>
<p>nelia, destined by the fates to enjoy the supreme power at Rome. L.
</p>
<p>Cornelius Cinna, and L. Cornelius Sylla, had both attained to that ele-
</p>
<p>vation. His schemes, however, all proved abortive, and he was strangled
</p>
<p>in prison with the other conspirators whx) had been arrested. Plutarch
</p>
<p>informs us, that he received the surname of Svra, in consequence of his
</p>
<p>having wasted a large sum of the public money in his quaestorship under
</p>
<p>Sylla^ who, enraged at his conduct, demanded a statement of his ac-
</p>
<p>counts in the senate, when Lentulus, with the utmost indifference, de-
</p>
<p>clared he had no accounts to produce, and contemptuously presented
</p>
<p>to him the calf of his leg, {sura.) Among the Romans, particularly
</p>
<p>among the boys, the player at tennis, who missed his stroke, presented
</p>
<p>the calf of his leg to receive as a punishment a certain number of blows
</p>
<p>upon it. Lentulus, in allusion to that game, acted in the manner just
</p>
<p>described, which accounts for the surname, or rather nickname, of
</p>
<p>Sura.

<p>Lentulus Spinther, P. Cornelius. Vid. Spinther.

<p>Lepidus, L. Aemilius, or L. Aemilius Ijepidus Paullus, called by Sal-

</p>
<p>who formed with Augustus and Mark Antony the second triumvirate.
</p>
<p>In early life he commenced a prosecution against Catiline, under the
</p>
<p>Plautian law. He held the consulship with C. Claudius Marcellus, B. C.
</p>
<p>52, the year that the censors expelled Sallust from the senate. He
</p>
<p>perislied in the conscription of the triumvirate, being left to his fate by

<p>his own brother.

</p>
<p>Vv'hen Catiline, five years after, formed his conspiracy, Q. Marcius Rex
</p>
<p>was sent to Faesulae, to levy troops, and adopt such other measures as
</p>
<p>he might deem proper. He had just returned from a military com-
</p>
<p>mand, had dem.anded a triumph, and met with opposition from a few
</p>
<p>unprincipled men in the senate. The Marcian family claimed descent
</p>
<p>from Ancus Marcius, and hence the name Marcius Rex.
</p>
<p>Marius, C. a native of Arpinum, remarkable for his militar}^ talents,
</p>
<p>but still more for his cruel and vindictive disposition. Having preserved
</p>
<p>the state by his braver}^, he afterwards brought it to the brink of ruin by
</p>
<p>his reckless and uncompromising violence. In early life, he was a
</p>
<p>ploughman, and wrought for hire. Quitting that employment, he entered
</p>
<p>the ranks of the army, and distinguished himself under Scipio at the
</p>
<p>siege and capture of Numantia. From the condition of a common sol-
</p>
<p>dier, he gradually rose to the com.mand of the Roman army, and to the
</p>
<p>office of consul. After bringing the war with Jugurtha to a close, he
</p>
<p>defeated m two terrible encounters the Teutones and Cimbri, slaying
</p>
<p>an immense number, and taking a vast multitude prisoners. After these
</p>
<p>signal victories, his ambitious feelings brought him in collision with Sylla,
</p>
<p>aiid a desolating civil war was the consequence. To crush the power
</p>
<p>of his rival, Sylla marched the troops which he had raised to carry on
</p>
<p>the war with Mithridates to Rome, and compelled Marius to fiee. In
</p>
<p>his banishment he underwent uncommon hardships, from which he was

<p>m the end released by Cinna's embracing his interests. He then re-
</p>
<p>turned to Rome to satiate his inhuman resentment, and butchered many
</p>
<p>thousands of the citizens. Tired at last with murder and assassination,
</p>
<p>he and Cinna appointed themselves consuls. But Marius, worn out by
</p>
<p>infirmities, age, and excessive intoxication, to which he probably had
</p>
<p>recourse to blunt the stings of a guilty conscience, died on the first day

<p>of his being invested with the consulship for the seventh tim.c.

<p>Massinissa. Son of Gala, king of the Massyli, in Numidia. He vras
</p>
<p>brought up at Carthage, where he contracted friendships with the nobles,
</p>
<p>and embraced the interests of the state. As an ally of the Carthaginians,
</p>
<p>he waged a successful war against S\-phax. He afterwards crossed
</p>
<p>over into Spain, still on the side of Carthage, and distinguished liimself
</p>
<p>by his bravery, activity, and military skill. After Scipio, surnamed
</p>
<p>Africanus Major, had defeated Asdrubal in this countr}% he found, among
</p>
<p>the prisoners of war, one of the nephews of Massinissa. The Roman
</p>
<p>commander sent this relative, loaded with presents, to his uncle, and
</p>
<p>gave him an escort for the safety of his person. Struck by this act of
</p>
<p>generosity, Massinissa forgot all former feelings of hostility, and joined

<p>his forces to those of Scipio. From this time, he continued a firm and
</p>
<p>faithful ally to his new friends, and it was to his exertions that the Romans
</p>
<p>owed many of their victories in Africa, and particularly the one which
</p>
<p>proved so fatal to Asdrubal and Syphax. In the battle of Zama also,
</p>
<p>Massinissa greatly contributed to the overthrow of Kannibal, and the
</p>
<p>Komans rewarded his fidelity by large accessions of territory. He at-
</p>
<p>tained to an advanced age, in the enjoyment of excellent health, and, on
</p>
<p>his death, left his kingdom to be divided by the younger Scipio among
</p>
<p>his thfee sons, Micipsa, Gulussa, and Manastabal. One circumstance in
</p>
<p>the life of ^^lassinissa is worthy of particular attention from its tragical
</p>
<p>nature. He had become possessed of Sophonisba, the captive wife of
</p>
<p>Syphax, to v/hom he had been attached in earlier days, and having car-
</p>
<p>ried her to Lis camp, he married her. But this step displeasing the
</p>
<p>Roman commander, the monarch sent her a cup of poison v/hich she
</p>
<p>readily drank, and expired, while Massinissa abandoned himself to the
</p>
<p>deepest sorrow.

</p>
<p>success in exposing the shameful bribery of Jugurtha, and arousing the
</p>
<p>commons to an assertion of their rights. He lost his life in a canvass
</p>
<p>for the consulship, (B. C. 102,) having been slain by L. Apulcius Satur-
</p>
<p>ninus, a tribune, from an apprehension that he would oppose him in his
</p>
<p>evil actions. Memmius fell under repeated strokes, by the bludgeons of
</p>
<p>hired assassins in the very midst of the assembly. Sallnst speaks in
</p>
<p>strong terms of his eloquence, though Cicero does not allow him a high
</p>
<p>rank among Roman orators.

<p>Metellus, Q. Caecilius, surnamed Numidicus, enjoyed the consul-
</p>
<p>ship with IvI. Junius Silanus, 111 B. C. He obtained Numidia as his
</p>
<p>province, and had nearly brought the war against Jugurtha to a close^
</p>
<p>by his military talents and incorruptible integrity, when he was removed
</p>
<p>from the command by the intrigues of Marius. For defeating Jugurtha
</p>
<p>and desolating Numidia, Metellus received the surname of Numidicus,
</p>
<p>and according to Eutropius (4, 27) a triumph. Some time after this,

</p>
<p>by force ; and, although all the good citizens supported him, he went, in
</p>
<p>order to prevent any commotion, into voluntary exile at Rhodes. Marius
</p>
<p>pronounced sentence of banishment against him, B. C. 104, two years
</p>
<p>after which, however, he was honourably recalled.
</p>
<p>Metellus, Q. Caecilius, surnamed Celer, filled the office of praetor
</p>
<p>during the consulship of Cicero, and levied troops against Catiline. On
</p>
<p>the expiration of his praetorsiiip, he obtained the province of Cisalpine
</p>
<p>Gaul, and subsequently held the consulship with L. Afranius. He mar-
</p>
<p>ried Clodia, the sister of P. Ciodius, and lost his life by poison admin-
</p>
<p>istered by this abandoned woman. Cicero praises his eloquence and
</p>
<p>his political integrity, and he is mentioned also by Horace (Od. 2 1.)

<p>MiNccius Rufus, M. was consul with Sp. Posturnius Albinus, B. 0.
</p>
<p>112. He obtained Macedonia for his province, and carried on a suc-
</p>
<p>cessful war against the Thracians, conquering the Scordisci and Treballi
</p>
<p>in Macedonia. Sallust calls him Quintus, while in Livy and in the con-

<p>for his personal bravery and militar)' talents, and for the long resistance
</p>
<p>Vv'hich he made against the armies of Rome. At last, however, being
</p>
<p>deserted by his allies, betrayed by his son Phamaces, arid frequently
</p>
<p>defeated by the Romans, he was, at his own request, slam by a Gaul,
</p>
<p>that he might not fall into the hands of his enemies. The constitution
</p>
<p>of this monarch was so fortified by antidotes, of many of which he is
</p>
<p>said to have been the inventor, that the strons^est and most active poisons

<p>the guards on duty should be strencrthened, and the whole affair dis-

<p>war, brought over a supply of money to Africa. He must not be con-
</p>
<p>founded with the Octavius who held the consulship with Cinna B. C. 8^,
</p>
<p>and who drove his colleague from the city, but was afterwards put to

<p>than three thousand persons were slain on this occasion, accordmg to
</p>
<p>Plutarch, and along with Gracchus perished M. Fulvius Flaccus, a man
</p>
<p>of consular dignity. Opimius subsequently allowed himself to be bribed

</p>
<p>and went into banishment at Dyrrhachium, where he died in great
</p>
<p>poverty. The name of this individual has also descended to later times
</p>
<p>in another way. The wine made during his consulship was remarkable
</p>
<p>for having attained to a very great age, and was called Vinum Opimi-
</p>
<p>anum. There appears to have been an uncommon vintage during the
</p>
<p>year in which he was consul. Cicero states that he tasted some Opimian
</p>
<p>wine seventy-five years after ; and Pliny informs us, that it was still to

<p>Perses. King of Macedonia. He was the son of Philip by a con-

<p>monarch. By a false accusation, however, he induced the monarch to

<p>to disinherit Perses, and secure the crown to his youngest son Antigo-
</p>
<p>nus ; but his own death, which happened soon after, frustrated his design.
</p>
<p>One of the first acts of Perses on coming to the throne, was to put

<p>Antigonus to death, both because he had been intended as successor to

</p>
<p>who led him in triumph through the streets of Rome. He was afterwards
</p>
<p>sent as prisoner to Alba, where he ended his days. The Romans treated
</p>
<p>him with more kindness than he deserved, allowing him to retain his

<p>attendants, money, &c. With Perses fell the Macedonian empire. He

<p>the civil war, and, in conjunction with Afranius, endeavoured to make

<p>appear to have been both able commanders. After having been forced

<p>to capitulate, Petreius joined the army of the republic in Africa, and, on
</p>
<p>being defeated along with Juba, king of Mauretania, in the battle of
</p>
<p>Thapsus, he and that prince engaged purposely in single combat, that
</p>
<p>they might die an honourable death. Juba soon laid Petreius dead at
</p>
<p>his'feet, and then, at his own request, fell by the hand of a slave.

<p>Piso, Cn.n A Roman of good family, but profligate and needy. The
</p>
<p>urgency of his wants, uniting with the depravity of his disposition, insti-
</p>
<p>gated him to any measure which had for its object the convulsion of the
</p>
<p>state, as the only remedy which could free him from difficulties and
</p>
<p>embarrassments. He readily entered into the conspiracy of Catiline,
</p>
<p>and, in the execution of the plot, he was at the head of an army to hold
</p>
<p>the Spaniards in subjection. The design transpired and necessarily
</p>
<p>prevented its execution. Soon after, although only quaestor, he ob-
</p>
<p>tained the government of Hither Spain, with the authority of propraetor,
</p>
<p>by the interest of Crassus, who wished to set him up in opposition to
</p>
<p>Pompey. The senate assented, in order to have so dangerous a citizen
</p>
<p>at a distance from the seat of government. The Spanish cavalry, which

<p>formed part of his train, assassinated him soon after his arrival in that

<p>country.

</p>
<p>under Q. Mucins Scaevola, when he attempted to protect the people of
</p>
<p>Asia from the oppression of the farmers of the revenue. In consequence
</p>
<p>of this, he fell under the displeasure of the equestrian order, and was
</p>
<p>brought to trial. Disregarding both the want of evidence and his un-
</p>
<p>sullied reputation before this impeachment, his judges condemned him,
</p>
<p>and sentenced him to banishment. He retired to Smyrna. Velleius
</p>
<p>Paterculus asserts that he was a man, the very best not only of his own
</p>
<p>time, but of any age. He had an uncommon knowledge of the military

</p>
<p>He resisted the urgent solicitations of Sylla, then at the head of affairs,
</p>
<p>to quit the place of his retreat and return to Rome. Rutilius wrote in
</p>
<p>Greek the history of his own times, the war against Hannibal, the siege
</p>
<p>of Numantia, at which he fought, and the war in Numidia. The last
</p>
<p>received high commendation for its impartiality. In addition to these
</p>
<p>works may be mentioned his own biography, which Tacitus praises,
</p>
<p>Observations on the Greek Philosophers, and Orations on several topics.

<p>umphed over the Carni ; and made the road from Placentia to Parma,
</p>
<p>hence called the Aemihan way. He had the honour of being appointed
</p>
<p>Princeps Senatus, and would have ranked in history with the very first
</p>
<p>characters of the Roman state, had not his splendid talents been tarnished
</p>
<p>by avarice and other degrading passions. Pliny agrees with Sallust in
</p>
<p>giving the unfavourable side of the picture. On the other hand, Cicero
</p>
<p>highly extols his virtues, abilities, and achievements. It is of this same
</p>
<p>individual that Valerius Maximus (3, 7, 8) relates the well-known anec-
</p>
<p>dote, so illustrative of the high estimation in which he was held by the
</p>
<p>people. Being accused of havnig received a bribe from a foreign prince,

<p>and a strong advocate for the power, of the nobility ; while Cicero, on
</p>
<p>the other hand, strives for this same reason to exalt his character. The
</p>
<p>truth undoubtedly lies between either extreme. He afterwards held
</p>
<p>the office of censor, and the consulship a second time. His name often
</p>
<p>occurs in the writings of Cicero, who speaks in great praise of a work
</p>
<p>of his in three books, recording the principal occurrences and trans-
</p>
<p>actions of his life. The orator considers it equal to Xenophon's Cyro-

<p>Semproxia. The wife of Decimus Brutus, by whom she became the

<p>mother of D. Junius Brutus, so well known for "the share he took in the

<p>assassination of Julius Caesar. She engaged in the conspiracy of Cati-
</p>
<p>line, without the knowledge, as it would appear, of her husband. Sallust
</p>
<p>has drawn her character in a veiy masterly manner, as that of a bold and
</p>
<p>unprincipled female.
</p>
<p>SiLAXus, Decimus Junius, held the office of consul with Licinius
</p>
<p>Murena, B. C. 64. They succeeded M. Tullius Cicero and C. Antonius.
</p>
<p>Being consuls elect, when the case of Catiline and his accomplices came
</p>
<p>Before the senate, Silanus was asked his opinion first, with respect to the
</p>
<p>punishment that ought to be inflicted on these traitors. He was in favour
</p>
<p>of their being put to death. Subsequently, however, he embraced the
</p>
<p>opinion of Tiberius Nero, who was for strengthening the guards and
</p>
<p>adjourning the debate.

<p>Silanus, M. Junius. A Roman nobleman, who had for his colleague in

<p>the consulship Q. Caecilius Metelius, ill B. C. He was totally defeated

<p>descended from that Sisenna w'ho was praetor A. U. C. 570. In his

<p>youth he practised as an orator, and is characterized by Cicero as a man

<p>of learning and wit, but of no great industr}', or knowledge of business.
</p>
<p>In more advanced life he was praetor of Achaia, and a friend of Atticus.

<p>sible that he may have given some sketch of Roman affairs from the
</p>
<p>burning of the city by the Gauls, but it is evident he had touched
</p>
<p>slightly on these early portions of the history : for though his work con-
</p>
<p>sisted of twenty, or, according to oihers, of tw^enty-two books, it ap-
</p>
<p>pears from a fragment of the second, which is still preserved, that he
</p>
<p>had there advanced in his narrative as far as the Social war, which broke
</p>
<p>out in the year 663. The greater part, therefore, w^as probablv devoted
</p>
<p>to :ae history of the civil wars of Marius : and indeed Yelleius Pater-
</p>
<p>culus calls his work Opu^ Belli Civilis Sidhmi. The great defect of
</p>
<p>his history consisted, it is said, in its not being wTitten with sufficient
</p>
<p>political freedom, at least concerning the character and conduct of Sylla,
</p>
<p>which is regretted by Sallust, in a passage bearmg ample testimony to
</p>
<p>the merits of Sisenna in other particulars. Cicero, while he admits his
</p>
<p>superiority over his predecessors, adds, that he was far fro-m perfection,

<p>his surname Nucerinus. Catihne, according to Sallust, reckoned hiin
</p>
<p>among his friends, and, according to the common account, he was not
</p>
<p>only connected with the conspiracy, but, having been summoned to stand
</p>
<p>trial for some misdemeanor, before the discovery of the plot, he fled into
</p>
<p>Africa with a number of his associates and dependants, and assisted the
</p>
<p>king of Mauretania against the neighbouring princes. Cicero, however,
</p>
<p>in his oration for P. Cornelius Sylla, says, that he quitted the city in
</p>
<p>consequence of an agreement with the king of Mauretania ; that he had
</p>
<p>previously been there, and that the idea of his being in the conspiracy
</p>
<p>was absurd. The orator describes him as a respectable man, and calls
</p>
<p>him his old friend and acquaintance. Sittius, with his troops, afterwards
</p>
<p>ioined the standard of Julius Caesar in Africa, and rendered him im-
</p>
<p>portant service against the forces of Scipio and Juba. The conqueror
</p>
<p>bestowed upon him, as a recompense, the city and territory of Cirta.

</p>
<p>Spinther, or P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, held the office of curule
</p>
<p>aedile, B. C. 65, when Cicero and Antonius were consuls. His great
</p>
<p>wealth enabled him to display a magnificence in the celebration of the
</p>
<p>games, which surpassed what had ever before been seen at Rome. To
</p>
<p>his charge P. Lentulus Sura, v/ho was then Praetor Urbanus, was con-
</p>
<p>fided, when the conspiracy of Catiline was detected in the capital. In the
</p>
<p>year 59 B. C. he was propraetor of Hispania Citerior. He was elected
</p>
<p>consul with Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos, and procured the recall of Ci-
</p>
<p>cero from banishment. In the civil war, he attached himself to the side
</p>
<p>of Pompey, and, having been taken prisoner, was brought before Caesar,
</p>
<p>at Corfinium, and set at liberty. He fought in the battle of Pharsalia,
</p>
<p>and fled to Rhodes, but the Rhodians refused him protection. Nothing
</p>
<p>farther is known of him. According to Valerius Maximus, he had the
</p>
<p>surname of Spinther, from his resemblance to a comedian of that name.

<p>Statilius, L. a Roman of equestrian rank, connected with the con-
</p>

<p>Sulla, L. Cornelius. A Roman of Patrician rank, who served at
</p>
<p>first under Marius. His activity and address contributed greatly to bring
</p>
<p>the Jugurthine war to a successful termination. Marius became, at lasf,
</p>
<p>jealous of Sylla's merit ; hence originated that quarrel between them,
</p>
<p>which was productive of the most enormous cruelties, and contributed
</p>
<p>to the final extinction of Roman liberty. Being sent to Asia to restrain
</p>
<p>the power of Mithridates, though under a different pretence, he proved
</p>
<p>himself both a brave soldier and an able general. On his return, he dis-
</p>
<p>played his military talents to great advantage in the Social war. So
</p>
<p>strongly were his soldiers attached to him, that when two tribunes were
</p>
<p>sent to take the command of his army, and give it to Marius, they stoned
</p>
<p>them to death. Marius, in revenge, put Sylla's friends in the city to the
</p>
<p>sword, upon which the latter marched to Rome, and compelled Marius
</p>
<p>to flee. The horrid proscription now began. A price was set on the
</p>
<p>head of Marius, but he effected lus escape. Sylla then set out against
</p>
<p>Mithridates, defeated his armies under different generals, and conckided
</p>
<p>a peace with him on very advantageous terms. Marius and Cinna having
</p>
<p>butchered many of Sylla's friends at Rome, he returned to Italy to avenge
</p>
<p>HISTORICAL IXDEX. 33]
</p>
<p>tl:H3ir deaths. On his arriYal, his conduct was marked by clemencv and
</p>
<p>moderation; bat no sooner were his enemies wiiolly within his power,
</p>
<p>than he committed the most enormous and barbarous acts of crnelty.
</p>
<p>To aggrandize himself, to exalt the patricians, and to glut his desire of
</p>
<p>revenge on his enemies, induced Sylla to assume the reins of absolute
</p>
<p>goTernment. He corrected the abuses introduced by popular and un-
</p>
<p>principled demagogues, restored the ancient laws, and enacted many that
</p>
<p>were salutary and beneficial. Still, tvranny marked his whole conduct,
</p>
<p>and rendered his administration a scene of terror, by his personal enmi-
</p>
<p>ties and insufferable despotism. Desire of revenge was a stronger passion
</p>
<p>in the mind of Sylla than love of power. After glutting his vengeance
</p>
<p>with the blood of thousands, and governing with despotic authority foi
</p>
<p>three years, he resigned the reins of power, and lived undisturbed as a
</p>
<p>private citizen. He died in gi'eat torment of the morbus pedicularis, in
</p>
<p>the sixtieth year of his age, about 78 B. C. The perpetual intoxication
</p>
<p>to which he had recourse to avoid the horrors of a guilty conscience,
</p>
<p>contributed to hasten his death.
</p>
<p>SvpHAX. A king of the Masaesyli, in Africa. At first he was hostile
</p>
<p>to the Carthaginians, and waged war against them ; but, on marrying
</p>
<p>Sophonisba, daughter of Hasdrubal, he formed an alhance with Carthage.
</p>
<p>He was defeated by Africanus in a night engagement, his tents being all
</p>
<p>destroyed by fire ; and was taken prisoner after a second battle, in which
</p>
<p>he and Hasdrubal were overcom.e by Laelius and Masinissa. Scipio
</p>
<p>sent him to Rome, when the senate ordered him to be kept a prisoner at
</p>
<p>Alba, from which he was removed at a later period to Tibur.
</p>
<p>Tarquinius, L. a man who left Rome to join the army of Catilme,
</p>
<p>but who was apprehended and brought back. On his examination, he
</p>
<p>promised to make a full disclosure, if the public faith were pledged for
</p>
<p>his safety. On this being done, he implicated Crassus in the plot. This
</p>
<p>charge was deemed by the senate utterly false, and Tarquinius was
</p>
<p>ordered to be confined in prison, unless he gave up the person who had
</p>
<p>instigated him to the act.

<p>Terextius Yarro, Cn. A man of senatorian rank, who held the office

</p>
<p>ValE'Rius Flaccus, L. A Roman nobleman, distrngiiished for ms
</p>
<p>tnilitarv talents and general ability. He traced his descent from Va-
</p>
<p>lerius Poplicola. After holding the office of tribune of the soldiers in
</p>
<p>Cilicia, and being quaestor in Spain, ho obtained the praetorship in the
</p>
<p>year in which Cicero was consul, and contributed by his activity to the
</p>
<p>crushing of Catiline's conspiracy. After the expiration of his praetor-
</p>
<p>ship, he succeeded to the government of Asia, and on his return was
</p>
<p>arraigned for extortion, but acquitted through the pow^erful eloquence of
</p>
<p>Cicero, who, together with Hortensius, pleaded his cause.
</p>
<p>Vargunteius, L. One of the accomplices of Catiline, who under-
</p>
<p>took, along with C. Cornelius, to murder Cicero in his own house. The
</p>
<p>consul was apprized of his danger by Curius, through Fulvia, and they
</p>
<p>were refused admittance. Cicero says they were both knights. Proba-
</p>
<p>bly Vargunteius, though a senator, was of equestrian origin.
</p>
<p>VoLTURcius, T. A native of Crotona, and one of the accomplices
</p>
<p>of Catiline. He was intrusted by Lentulus with a letter for Catibne.
</p>
<p>On being seized, and brought before the senate, he at first pleaded entire
</p>
<p>ignorance of the conspiracy, but, on being assured of his safety, he made
</p>
<p>a full discovery of all that he knew. His testimony was conrirmed by
</p>
<p>the deputies of the Allobroges.
</p>
<p>VoLUx, son of Bocchus, king of Mauretania, sent by his father, at the
</p>
<p>head of a large body of cavalry to meet Sylla, quaestor undci Mariu,
</p>
<p>and ecort him to the royal presence.

<p>ed with a view to the especial use of persons forming or enrich-
</p>

<p>sess any reliable means of forming a true estimate of any pro-

</p>
<p>logue, consisting of about two thousand volujnes, coa^bines the
</p>
<p>two-fold advantages of great economy in price with neatness

<p>often elegance of typographical execution, in many instances the
