</p>
<p>IT is not possible that men engaged in political
</p>
<p>life in the mother country, should attend to
</p>
<p>every event which interests or even agitates the
</p>
<p>feelings of their countrymen in distant colonies ;
</p>
<p>and nothing can he more ill-judged than to
</p>
<p>clamour for attention to remote transactions,
</p>
<p>when they are not of high importance; but
</p>
<p>busy as the political world is, and small as dis-
</p>
<p>tant objects must naturally appear to it, it is
</p>
<p>never disposed to pass over any remarkable
</p>
<p>examples of oppression and injustice, without
</p>
<p>severe scrutiny. However distant the country
</p>
<p>in which an Englishman has suffered or perpe-
</p>
<p>trated tyranny, there is the fairest disposition at
</p>
<p>home, to hear and to redress the wrong.
</p>
<p>It may be hoped then, that this narrative will
</p>
<p>not be wholly overlooked ; and that those whose

<p>B
</p>
<p>sufferings it relates, will meet with favour and
</p>
<p>protection from thatnumerous class whose aver-
</p>
<p>sion to the abuse of power makes them always
</p>
<p>ready to advocate the cause of the oppressed.
</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible to suppose,, that those
</p>
<p>civil rights which are the birth-right of an
</p>
<p>JEnglishman, can be maintained in our colonies
</p>
<p>in the same state of purity they are enjoyed at
</p>
<p>home. The immensity of the distance, and the
</p>
<p>impossibility of immediate appeal to the wisdom
</p>
<p>of superior tribunals in the mother country,
</p>
<p>necessarily confer upon the supreme power in
</p>
<p>our remote dependencies a greater share of au-
</p>
<p>thority than is deemed compatible with the
</p>
<p>existence of civil liberty at home. But though
</p>
<p>our colonists have not all our rights, they have
</p>
<p>some, and in proportion as they are few, they
</p>
<p>become more important, being naturally such
</p>
<p>as are barely sufficient to guard the distant sub-
</p>
<p>ject from oppression,
</p>
<p>Amongst other securities against the oppres-
</p>
<p>sive hand of power in our East India settle-
</p>
<p>ments, the establishment of trial by jury was
</p>
<p>many years ago an anxious object with some
</p>
<p>of the wisest of our legislators ; by them it
</p>
<p>was regarded as a means of teaching the native
</p>
<p>a more perfect system of justice, whilst it gave

<p>to the resident the benefit of those laws to
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>which he had been accustomed, and afforded
</p>
<p>him the best shelter against the possible excess
</p>
<p>of his governors.
</p>
<p>The generous and humane motives that ac-
</p>
<p>tuated parliament, as well as its wisdom in
</p>
<p>extending the sphere of trial by jury, was uni-
</p>
<p>versally admitted, and the benefits that have
</p>
<p>practically ensued, have never yet been called
</p>
<p>in question. Indeed nothing can appear more
</p>
<p>beneficial than the introduction of such an insti-
</p>
<p>tution in our eastern dominions : it not only
</p>
<p>offers the atonement of civilization for the vio-
</p>
<p>lence of conquest, but it sends the colonist
</p>
<p>abroad with a more cheerful confidence in his
</p>
<p>destiny, and leaves his friends and kindred at
</p>
<p>home with the comfortable certainty that he
</p>
<p>will always be sheltered from despotism and
</p>
<p>injustice.
</p>
<p>But to secure these advantages, an appeal
</p>
<p>to a jury ought, as in the mother country, al-
</p>
<p>ways to be open ; no man should be threatened
</p>
<p>by the government for resorting to it; no man
</p>
<p>should be banished or reduced to certainpoverty
</p>
<p>for having made it. The juries to whom that
</p>
<p>appeal has been made, should, when they decide,
</p>
<p>be protected in life, fortune, and character.
</p>
<p>The influence government may have over them,

<p>ihould never be wantonly exerted for the per-
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>version of justice ; far less should the eventual
</p>
<p>want of success of such unwarrantable inter-
</p>
<p>ference lead to the vindictive punishment of
</p>
<p>those it has in vain attempted to mislead. How
</p>
<p>far these obvious feelings have been respected
</p>
<p>in the course of the prosecutions that have
</p>
<p>lately taken place at Madras, it is the business
</p>
<p>of the present short narrative to exhibit.
</p>
<p>V A few years ago, when it was publicly known
</p>
<p>that an adjustmentof the debts of the late nabob
</p>
<p>of Carnatic was about to take place, a very con-
</p>
<p>siderable amount of nabob's bonds appeared in
</p>
<p>the market at Madras, and many of them were
</p>
<p>daily hawked about at much lower prices than
</p>
<p>paper of the same denomination was sold for, be-
</p>
<p>fore it was known that any arrangement of this
</p>
<p>debt was to take place. It was then reasonably
</p>
<p>suspected, and it has since been proved, that
</p>
<p>the durbar servants were principally concerned
</p>
<p>in the fabrication of these spurious bonds, they
</p>
<p>having enjoyed a greater facility of giving co-
</p>
<p>lour to their claims, by connecting them with
</p>
<p>the real transactions, in the records to which
</p>
<p>they had free access.
</p>
<p>Roya Reddy Row, Dewauny Peishcar, and
</p>
<p>head Marhatta Sherestadar to the present na-
</p>
<p>bob Azeeru ul Dowlah, was said to be deeply

</p>
<p>engaged in these forgeries^but no communication
</p>
<p>was made to government on this subject, till
</p>
<p>the beginning of the year 1808. The infor-
</p>
<p>mation then laid before them, was referred to
</p>
<p>their advocate-general, Mr. Anstruther cer-
</p>
<p>tainly not the person to whose decision any
</p>
<p>charge affecting the character of Roya Reddy
</p>
<p>Row ought in preference to have been sub-
</p>
<p>mitted, as it was generally known that lie, to-
</p>
<p>gether with the company's solicitor, Mr. Orme,
</p>
<p>and some other gentlemen, had speculated very
</p>
<p>deeply in nabob's bonds, purchased from Reddy
</p>
<p>Row, or by his recommendation. In conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the advocate-general's advice, a com-
</p>
<p>mittee was appointed to investigate the truth
</p>
<p>of this information, of which he was himself
</p>
<p>the chairman ; and the company's solicitor the
</p>
<p>secretary. As might be expected, the conduct
</p>
<p>of this enquiry was left chiefly to the two gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the law, and the result of course was,
</p>
<p>that the charges against Roya Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>were judged to be wholly false and malicious.
</p>
<p>About this time, the commissioners appointed
</p>
<p>for investigating the Carnatic debts at Madras,
</p>
<p>began to publish the claims preferred to them,
</p>
<p>and the first advertised for investigation, though
</p>
<p>by no means the first in the order given in, was
</p>
<p>one on the part of Roya Reddy Row, upon a
</p>
<p>bond purporting to be executed by Omdut ul

<p>Omrah, in favour of Gopal Row, dated 26th
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>July, 1798, for 38,500 pagodas ; the same
</p>
<p>which has since been the subject of one crimi-
</p>
<p>nal trial, and has given rise to two others,
</p>
<p>which was well known to be the property of
</p>
<p>the advocate-general, and other gentlemen con-
</p>
<p>cerned with him. The claim was challenged
</p>
<p>by Mr. William Light, the agent for Avada-
</p>
<p>num Poupiah Braminy. The commissioners
</p>
<p>examined witnesses for and against it ; during
</p>
<p>which proceedings so strong a disposition was
</p>
<p>displayed to support the bond, that Poupiah
</p>
<p>was advised to subject its validity to the consi-
</p>
<p>deration of a much higher and a more public
</p>
<p>tribunal, and immediately commenced a prose-
</p>
<p>cution against Roya Reddy Row, for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy and forgery. This appeal to the su-
</p>
<p>perior wisdom, and the more perfect impar-
</p>
<p>tiality of a court of justice, became the more
</p>
<p>necessary from the enormity of Reddy Row's
</p>
<p>claims, more than one half of which he stated
</p>
<p>to have proceeded from loans to the nabob, in
</p>
<p>the month preceding his death, and when he
</p>
<p>was known to be past recovery.* If the pro-
</p>
<p>perty of the real creditor was ever to be de-.
</p>
<p>fended, this undoubtedly appeared the time for
</p>
<p>doing it. Informations were accordingly lodged

<p>claims preferred by lleddy Row, before the commissioners.
</p>
<p>before the sitting magistrate, and the two ac-
</p>
<p>cused persons were held to bail, to take their
</p>
<p>trial at the ensuing quarter sessions.
</p>
<p>The commissioners were immediately applied
</p>
<p>to by the sitting magistrate, for the produc-
</p>
<p>tion of the bond at the public office ; when in
</p>
<p>reply they intimated that they believed the
</p>
<p>prosecution to be the effect of a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>against Roya Reddy Row, of which Avada-
</p>
<p>num Poupiah Braminy, was the head, stating,
</p>
<p>that they had recommended it to the governor
</p>
<p>in council, to direct his law officers to inspect
</p>
<p>their proceedings, with a view to a prosecution
</p>
<p>against Poupiah and others for a conspiracy
</p>
<p>and perjury ; though in fact this menaced pro-
</p>
<p>secution never took place.
</p>
<p>This attempt to obstruct the trial of Reddy
</p>
<p>Row, was strongly supported by another of a
</p>
<p>similar nature, which, however, was carried a
</p>
<p>little farther. A few days after the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of Reddy Row was commenced, informa-
</p>
<p>tions were brought before the magistrates, by
</p>
<p>the law officers, acting under the orders of go-
</p>
<p>vernment, against Poupiah and three others,
</p>
<p>for a conspiracy to forge a nabob's bond, of
</p>
<p>which intimation had been given by the com-
</p>
<p>missioners to the sitting magistrate, at the time

</p>
<p>they gave notice of the aforementioned intended
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>prosecution, for a conspiracy and perjury. The
</p>
<p>parties were held to bail. A bill of indictment
</p>
<p>was found against them by the grand jury at
</p>
<p>the October sessions. The indictment was
</p>
<p>traversed by consent, and the trial lay over for
</p>
<p>the January sessions, at the commencement of
</p>
<p>which Poupiah died ; but though the other
</p>
<p>three persons were forthcoming, no notice was
</p>
<p>given by the law officers of their going to
</p>
<p>trial against them.
</p>
<p>A third session came on upon the 8th of
</p>
<p>May, when the Company's solicitor gave no-
</p>
<p>tice to the solicitor for the defendants, that go-
</p>
<p>vernment did not mean to prosecute the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. The parties were accordingly brought
</p>
<p>up, and their bail discharged.
</p>
<p>If public justice had been the object in view,
</p>
<p>in preferring this indictment, there was no
</p>
<p>reason why the law-officers should not have
</p>
<p>proceeded with the trial against the three sur-
</p>
<p>viving defendants. Although one of the par-
</p>

<p>no seiious ground for either of them ; and that
</p>
<p>both were adopted, as tending to put a stop to
</p>
<p>the prosecution against Reddy Row, if not re-
</p>
<p>sorted to for that express purpose.
</p>
<p>The means, however, of thwarting the opera-
</p>
<p>tions of justice, and of preventing the merited
</p>
<p>punishment of RoyaReddy Row were not yet ex-
</p>
<p>hausted* The persons who deposed to the actual
</p>
<p>fabrication of the bond, Arnachetta Row and
</p>
<p>Beemah Row, had been confidential servants to
</p>
<p>Roya Reddy Row, and as such had beenemplo} 7 -
</p>
<p>ed by him in many of his criminal transactions.
</p>
<p>It became therefore of importance to Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>as well on account of his approaching trial, as of
</p>
<p>the other numerous forgeries that he had commit-
</p>
<p>ted, to incapacitate these men from appearing
</p>
<p>against him. Accordingly informations were
</p>
<p>sworn to by him, charging Arnachetta Row
</p>
<p>and Beemah Row with perjury, a?signed upon
</p>
<p>some small variance in their evidences,a variance
</p>
<p>that ought rather to have induced a belief,than
</p>
<p>a doubt, of their testimony, and upon these in-
</p>
<p>formations they were held to bail : and this pro-
</p>
<p>secution was conducted by the law officers of the
</p>
<p>Company, acting under the orders of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment,atthe recommendation of thecommissioners.

<p>sons from coming forward as witnesses. And
</p>
<p>as almost all information regarding claims
</p>
<p>upon the nabobs, must be procured from na-

<p>tives, it was evident that this measure would
</p>
<p>frustrate all fair investigation, and leave the
</p>
<p>fund for the payment of the real creditors at
</p>
<p>the mercy of Reddy Row, and his creatures, the
</p>
<p>Durbar servants, at least as far as the derision
</p>
<p>of the commissioners in India could effect it.
</p>
<p>Alarmed at the dangers with which their
</p>
<p>interests seemed threatened, the bona fide cre-
</p>
<p>ditors of the nabob of the Carnatic had
</p>
<p>appointed a committee to watch over the
</p>
<p>interests of the fair creditors, and to represent to
</p>
<p>government the pernicious effects the cause of
</p>
<p>justice must sustain from their interference.
</p>
<p>But instead of obtaining any protection, or even
</p>
<p>forbearance from government, the committee
</p>
<p>were accused of acts of wanton obstruction to
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the commissioners : they
</p>
<p>were harshly reprimanded, and threatened with
</p>
<p>the severest effects of public displeasure.* The

<p>information which they had given to govern-
</p>

</p>

<p>of Reddy Row was passed by unnoticed ;
</p>
<p>their request to have a copy of his report
</p>
<p>upon their letter was refused, and Mr. Roe-
</p>
<p>buck, one ofthe committee, finding that this was
</p>
<p>the only reward of his public spirit, withdrew
</p>
<p>himself from all further concern in the business.
</p>
<p>In order to conduct the trial of Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>it was necessary for the other members of the
</p>
<p>committee, who determined to persevere, to
</p>
<p>procure from the commissioners several docu-
</p>
<p>ments of which they had become possessed in
</p>
<p>their late investigation of the charges against
</p>
<p>Reddy Row. To an application from the so-
</p>
<p>licitor for the prosecution for these documents,
</p>
<p>a positive refusal was received,* nor could, they
</p>
<p>be procured till they were ordered to bev given
</p>
<p>up bythe court, on which occasion the conduct
</p>
<p>of the commissioners was stigmatised by one of
</p>
<p>the judges on the bench, as a scandalous ob-
</p>
<p>struction of public justice.
</p>
<p>As the approaching trials involved interests
</p>
<p>of considerable extent, the greatest care was
</p>
<p>very properly taken by the sheriff to select
</p>
<p>persons for the grand jury, who were known
</p>
<p>to have no kind of interest in claims upon the
</p>
<p>Durbar ; only sixteen were sworn, and of these
</p>
<p>fifteen were in the service of the company.*

<p>Their first act was to reject the bill against
</p>
<p>Beemah How, and Arnachetta Row, though it
</p>
<p>had been recommended by the commissioners,
</p>
<p>advised by the law officers, and patronized by
</p>
<p>government. Their next act was to find against
</p>
<p>Roya Reddy Row and Annunda Row that bill,
</p>
<p>which all these various powers had been active-
</p>
<p>ly at work to defeat.
</p>
<p>The quarter sessions of oyer and terminer
</p>
<p>opened on the 10th of October, and upon the
</p>
<p>plea of the impending dispatch of the ships for
</p>
<p>Europe, was immediately adjourned for fifteen
</p>
<p>days, being the first time the court ever evin-
</p>
<p>ced such indulgent consideration for the con-
</p>
<p>venience of the public, though the spring and
</p>
<p>autumn ships were generally dispatched about
</p>
<p>the period the quarter sessions were held. It was
</p>
<p>not therefore till the 10th of November the court
</p>
<p>proceeded to the trial of Reddy Row andAnnun-
</p>
<p>daRow,against whom the bill had been found by
</p>
<p>the grand jury. In this trial there were three is-
</p>
<p>sues : viz. the justice of the claim upon which
</p>
<p>the bond was alleged to be founded, the
</p>
<p>presence of the defendant and Annunda Row at
</p>
<p>the Durbar on the 26th of July, 1798, when it
</p>
<p>was alleged he had written it by order of the
</p>
<p>Nabob, and the actual fabrication of the bond,
</p>
<p>two years after the death of the Nabob.

<p>Against the j ustice of the claim., a variety
</p>
<p>13 ;|
</p>
<p>/of circumstantial evidence was adduced on the
</p>
<p>part of the prosecution. To prove the absence of
</p>
<p>the defendant Annunda Row, in July 1798,
</p>
<p>.eleven credible unimpeached witnesses deposed
</p>
<p>that he had resided in the districts of Chillam-
</p>
<p>brura and Manoorgudy from the year 1797, to
</p>
<p>the month of May, 1800; three witnesses, ser-
</p>
<p>vants of the late Colonel Barret, in whose office
</p>
<p>at the Durbar it was pretended that Annunda,
</p>
<p>Row had been employed, deposed that they
</p>
<p>Jiad never seen -him there, although they were
</p>
<p>in pretty constant attendance upon their master;
</p>
<p>fourteen witnesses servants of the Durbar de-
</p>
<p>posed likewise that they had never seen him
</p>
<p>there during the time in question ; and the
</p>
<p>third point at issue was proved by Arnachetta
</p>
<p>Row and Beemah Row, who swore to the
</p>
<p>actual fabrication of the bond some time in the
</p>
<p>month of July, 1803.
</p>
<p>On the part of the defence it was pretended
</p>
<p>that the claim arose out of a loan made in 1797
</p>
<p>fry Gopal Row to Anwar Ally KhanTrenter of
</p>
<p>the Arcot district on account of the circar.
</p>
<p>jOn the part of the prosecution it was proved
</p>
<p>that Anwar Ally Khan remained in the renter-
</p>
<p>sbip only fifty-seven days, that he was then
</p>
<p>turned out by the nabob, and that Hussani

<p>jtJl Mulk, the nabob's brother, was appointed
</p>
<p>io it; that it was customary in the Nabob's
</p>
<p>country, when a renter -was removed be lore the
</p>
<p>expiration of the year, for his successor to take
</p>
<p>possession of all the accounts of the district,
</p>
<p>and make up the account for the entire year,
</p>
<p>as well of the management of his predecessor
</p>
<p>as of his own. That Hussam Ul Mulk accord-
</p>
<p>ingly sent Syed Moortaza Hussam to take
</p>
<p>possession of all the accounts of the district of
</p>
<p>Arcot upon the removal of Amwar Ally Khan,
</p>
<p>and the prosecutors offered, and more than
</p>
<p>once importuned the court to be allowed to
</p>
<p>produce those accounts in evidence to prove
</p>
<p>that there was no trace in them whatever of such
</p>
<p>loan made by Gopal Row to Amwar Ally Khan
</p>
<p>for account of the Circar, nor for any other ac-

<p>count.
</p>
<p>They also produced the two Serishtadars of
</p>
<p>Hussam Ul Mulk, who made up, the accounts
</p>
<p>in order to prove them, but the chief justice
</p>
<p>would neither admit the production of the ac-
</p>
<p>count or receive the evidence of the Serishta-
</p>
<p>dars. Hussam Ul Mulk had himself been
</p>
<p>summoned to produce the accounts, but he re-
</p>
<p>fused to appear in court on the plea of ill
</p>
<p>health, and in excusing himself from obeying

<p>justice, Sir Thomas Strange, acquainting him

<p>in which were included those of the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of Anwar Ally Khan by his Serishtadars
</p>
<p>who made them up, in which there appeared
</p>
<p>no entry of the loan of Gopal Row.*
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this the chief justice per-
</p>
<p>severed in refusing to receive these accounts
</p>
<p>in evidence, though if admitted they alone
</p>
<p>would have completely destroyed the foun-
</p>
<p>dation of Reddy Row's claim. On the part of
</p>
<p>the defence many documents were produced
</p>
<p>from the Dufters in support of the claim ; and
</p>
<p>some witnesses were brought to prove the ser-
</p>
<p>vice of Annunda Row at the Durbar at the
</p>
<p>time alleged, amongst these was Mr. John.
</p>
<p>Batley. It was also attempted to discre-

<p>custody of the d ufters had been very loosely
</p>
<p>kept, and that Reddy Row had had too free
</p>
<p>access to them. Upon the examination of the
</p>
<p>commissioners, it also came out, that when the
</p>
<p>dufters came into their charge., some of them
</p>
<p>were without locks and keys; and that after
</p>
<p>they were in their custody, the keys were not
</p>
<p>kept by themselves but left to the care of their
</p>
<p>servants*
</p>
<p>Excepting Mr. Batley, none of the principal
</p>
<p>servants of the Durbar proved the service of
</p>
<p>Annunda Row at the time in question : and
</p>
<p>particularly Madaputy Tremal Row, a head
</p>
<p>Serishtadar in the Dewaney department, and a
</p>
<p>witness that the defence relied upon greatly,
</p>
<p>and upon whose testimony the chief justice, in
</p>
<p>his summing up, laid particular emphasis,
</p>
<p>positively swore that he had never seen Annun-

<p>upon to prove it : it appeared to be so weak a
</p>
<p>defence that the Chief Justice did not even
</p>
<p>notice it in his summing up. And it is some-
</p>
<p>thing remarkable that Mr. George Arbuthnot,
</p>
<p>at present a partner in the house of Lautour
</p>
<p>and Co. who was examined in the investigation
</p>
<p>before thecommissioners in support of the clairn.,
</p>
<p>should not have been called as a witness upon
</p>
<p>the trial ; because if his testimony went at all
</p>
<p>to the support of the claim upon the former
</p>
<p>occasion, it would have equally benefited the
</p>
<p>defence upon the latter.
</p>
<p>The defence was closed on the 28th of No-
</p>
<p>vember, when Mr. Marsh, council for the pro-
</p>
<p>secution, replied, and the Chief Justice inti^
</p>
<p>mated to the jury that it would be necessary
</p>
<p>for him to adjourn the court till the 30th,
</p>
<p>that he might arrange his notes for the sum-
</p>
<p>ming up of the evidence. On Wednesday,
</p>
<p>the 30th of November, the court was again ad-
</p>
<p>journed till Friday the 2d of December ; on
</p>
<p>which day it was again adjourned to Monday
</p>
<p>the 5th. On Monday it was once more adjourned
</p>
<p>to Wednesday the 7th, when the Chief Justice
</p>
<p>came in prepared to sum up the evidence ; but
</p>
<p>two of the jury being sick, the court was again
</p>
<p>adjourned till the following day ; and from

<p>that till Friday the 9th of November,' when after

</p>
<p>the jury retired, and in about twenty minutes
</p>
<p>returned a verdict of guilty.
</p>
<p>As the advocate-general rested the de-
</p>
<p>fence chiefly on the Dufters, or records of the
</p>
<p>Durbar, it will be proper here to explain how
</p>
<p>they are kept. All the accounts and transac*-
</p>
<p>tions of the Durbar are kept and recorded upon
</p>
<p>narrow strips of paper about fifteen inches long
</p>
<p>and four inches wide : the papers relating to
</p>
<p>the same account or transaction loosely tacked
</p>
<p>together by a thread at the corner ; so that no-
</p>
<p>thing is easier than to withdraw,, substitute and
</p>
<p>Interpolate papers : in a word to falsify and
</p>
<p>fabricate them, to make them correspond with
</p>
<p>any spurious claim. Nothing can be more un-
</p>
<p>like the records of European public offices, and
</p>
<p>the books of a merchant's counting-house, to
</p>
<p>which the advocate -general always compared
</p>
<p>them in point of weight and authenticity. For
</p>
<p>any one, the least acquainted with business,
</p>
<p>knows that it is almost impossible to falsify
</p>
<p>a merchant's books without detection.
</p>
<p>It is important also to observe, that the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice in his summing up stated, "that
</p>
<p><f the commissioners being appointed bythesu-
</p>
<p>" preme government acting under the deed of co-
</p>

</p>
<p>" ought to have the exclusive cognisance of all
</p>
<p>" matters connected with the claims of which
</p>
<p>" they have the investigation; that he had his
</p>
<p>" doubts whether his majesty's courtsof judica-
</p>
<p>" ture were competent to take cognisance of the
</p>
<p>" forgery of a bond, which the commissioners
</p>
<p><e had investigated and had judged to be a good
</p>
<p>" one ; and that whatever might be the verdict
</p>
<p>" of the j ury, the commissioners were com petent,

<p>:t and it was their bounden duty to recommend
</p>
<p>'' the bond to the commissioners in England as a
</p>
<p>:e good and just one, if they in their judgment
</p>
<p>" deemed it to be so."*
</p>
<p>The prosecutors on this trial had every diffi-
</p>
<p>culty to contend against, that wealth, power,
</p>
<p>and interest could oppose to them. The
</p>
<p>wealth of Reddy Row was profusely scattered
</p>
<p>in suborning witnesses. The power of govern-
</p>
<p>ment was avowedly exercised in the defence of
</p>
<p>the prisoners; as was the influence of the nabob
</p>
<p>and of the commissioners ; the effects of which
</p>
<p>upon some of the witnesses, was but too visible
</p>
<p>during the trial. To the prosecutors every
</p>
<p>aid was refused by the commissioners : they
</p>
<p>resisted, as has been already stated, even the
</p>
<p>production of the forged bond, until compelled

<p>them regularly attended the defendants upon
</p>
<p>their trial, and took their seat near Mr. John

</p>

<p>The adjournment of the court for nine days
</p>
<p>after the evidence on both sides had closed.,
</p>
<p>whilst the jury were dispersed, did not pass
</p>
<p>without observation. The advocate-general
</p>
<p>seemed to be aware of the impropriety of such
</p>
<p>a procedure, and took an opportunity in court
</p>
<p>to ascribe it in part to the indisposition of the
</p>
<p>Chief Justice, which excuse was repeated by
</p>
<p>his lordship from the bench, though it is singu-
</p>
<p>lar that the Chief Justice was at a public en-
</p>
<p>tertainment given by the Commander in Chief
</p>
<p>upon the 30th of November; that in the inter-
</p>
<p>val betwixt that day and Monday the 5th of
</p>
<p>December, he had interviews of considerable
</p>
<p>length with the law officers of government,
</p>
<p>and that on that day, notwithstanding it was
</p>
<p>very rainy and tempestuous, he came to his
</p>
<p>chambers in the fort, situated at least three
</p>
<p>miles from his country-house, and there tran-
</p>
<p>sacted business with the law officers.
</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten, that this same jury,
</p>
<p>which determined upon the accusation against
</p>

<p>greatest commendation from the Chief Justice
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>for their penetration and sagacity in discovering
</p>
<p>the innocence of a prisoner who was unjustly
</p>
<p>accused of murder. The consequence of their
</p>
<p>acuteness and attention to their duty on that oc-
</p>
<p>casion was, that the accusers themselves were
</p>
<p>put upon their trial for the same murder, found
</p>
<p>guilty and executed. They had none of them any
</p>
<p>immediate connection with the fund upon which
</p>
<p>the forgery was committed ; and if indeed they
</p>
<p>could he suspected of any bias, it must have
</p>
<p>naturally inclined to that side of the question to
</p>
<p>which government, by their own activity, and
</p>
<p>that of their law officers, evinced themselves
</p>
<p>to be so well disposed.
</p>
<p>From some glaring inconsistency which the
</p>
<p>prosecutors had observed in the informations
</p>
<p>given by Mr. John Battley, in the investiga-
</p>
<p>tion of Reddy Row's claim before the commis-
</p>
<p>sioners, and from the close connection that was
</p>
<p>known to subsist between him and Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>the prosecutors apprehended that he would go
</p>
<p>great lengths to gftt his friend and confederate
</p>
<p>acquitted. Mr. Battley, accordingly, attended
</p>
<p>the whole of the trial, and being the last witness
</p>
<p>examined, came fully prepared to support and
</p>
<p>strengthen the weak, and fill up the defective
</p>
<p>parts. In a word he appeared to be brought

</p>
<p>uot to speak to one or two points, but to sup-
</p>
<p>ply every thing that appeared wanting* in.tlie
</p>
<p>preceding evidence. AccoEdingly, although
</p>
<p>he had been only in a very inferior and subal-
</p>
<p>tern situation in the Durbar during the whole
</p>
<p>of the reign of Omdut Ul Omrah, yet he knew
</p>
<p>every thing., and gave testimony in support of
</p>
<p>every part of the defence.
</p>
<p>The consequence was that a bill of indict-
</p>
<p>ment for perjury was preferred against him,
</p>
<p>and found at the same sessions : the perjury
</p>
<p>being assigned upon that part of his evidence,
</p>
<p>which deposed to the fact of Annunda Row's
</p>
<p>presence and service at the Durbar of the late
</p>
<p>nabob. It appearing, likewise, from some of
</p>
<p>the circumstantial evidence on the part of the
</p>
<p>prosecution, that Mr. Battley and Reddy Row
</p>
<p>had conspired to pass upon Venaigum Moodel-
</p>
<p>liar a forged bond, purporting to be a nabob's
</p>
<p>bond, another bill of indictment for a cheat and
</p>
<p>conspiracy was on this account preferred and
</p>
<p>found against them.
</p>
<p>After the verdict upon the 9th of December
</p>
<p>the court was adjourned till Monday the 12th,
</p>
<p>during which time the defendants, by consent
</p>
<p>of the prosecutors, vyere left at large upon
</p>
<p>their recognisances. Immediately on the
</p>
<p>court's meeting the advocate-general moved for

<p>a rule to shew cause why a new trial should not
</p>
<p>be granted, upon the ground of the verdict
</p>
<p>being contrary to evidence, and contrary to the
</p>
<p>directions of the judge : and notice was at the
</p>
<p>same time given, that he would move in arrest
</p>
<p>of judgment.
</p>
<p>As Mr. Marsh had left the presidency to at-
</p>
<p>tend a court-martial at Bangalore, Mr. Ga-
</p>
<p>hagan, on the part of the prosecution, ac-
</p>
<p>quainted the court, that not having been em-
</p>
<p>ployed in the trial, and not being master of so
</p>
<p>voluminous a subject, he was not then prepared
</p>
<p>to argue the question : on which it was agreed
</p>
<p>to postpone the argument upon the motion, until
</p>
<p>the ensuing sessions of oyer and terminer ; the
</p>
<p>Chief Justice declaring that such motion should
</p>
<p>be maintained in sessions and not in term. Mr.
</p>
<p>Gahagan, on the part of the prosecution, con-
</p>
<p>sented that the defendants should on this occasion
</p>
<p>continue at large upon their recognizance, the
</p>
<p>Chief Justice at the same time declaring, that
</p>
<p>he did not require his consent to such a mea-
</p>
<p>sure, but should order it of his own authority.
</p>
<p>In this stage of the business, the prosecutors
</p>
<p>dreading that misrepresentations inight be
</p>
<p>spread abroad, were desirous that the trial
</p>
<p>should be published, in order that all might
</p>
<p>judge of the justice of the verdict. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly they sent an advertisement to the Madras

<p>gazette, giving notice to that effect, which was
</p>
<p>expunged by the chief secretary to govern-
</p>
<p>ment., who at Madras is ex officio licenser of
</p>
<p>the press. They then applied formally to go-
</p>
<p>vernment, and they were informed in reply that
</p>
<p>the governor in council deemed it inexpedient
</p>
<p>to sanction the proposed publication*. Al-
</p>
<p>though the reply given was somewhat ambigu-
</p>
<p>ous, and was evidently meant to be so, yet to
</p>
<p>the editor it appeared that it was most distinct-
</p>
<p>ly to be regarded as a prohibition, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Marsh, who afterwards applied to government
</p>
<p>for the same permission, met with a similar re-
</p>
<p>fusal. This gentleman indeed applied in the
</p>
<p>course of the next term to the supreme court
</p>
<p>for their permission to publish both trials,
</p>
<p>which was refused by the Chief Justice,
</p>
<p>without any reason assigned, though Sir
</p>
<p>Benjamin Sullivan readily granted his as-
</p>
<p>sent, and assigned such reasons for it,
</p>
<p>as every Englishman must honour and reveref.
</p>
<p>The publication, however, was suppressed by
</p>
<p>the casting vote which the chief justice possesses
</p>
<p>under the constitution of the court, there being
</p>
<p>only two judges present. The next quarter
</p>
<p>sessions were fixed for the 4th of January,

<p>Speech, on this subject.
</p>
<p>1809. In the interim great exertions were
</p>
<p>made by the defendants and their supporters
</p>
<p>to meet the approaching trials.
</p>
<p>Prior to the first trial of Reddy Row, the law
</p>
<p>officers of government had applied to Mr. Raven-
</p>
<p>shaw the collector of Arcot,through the board of
</p>
<p>revenue upon the subject of AnuundaRow, who
</p>
<p>on enquiry found that Anuunda had in fact re-
</p>
<p>sided in the district at the time stated on the
</p>
<p>part of the prosecution, and reported the same
</p>
<p>.accordingly. There is not perhaps in the ser-
</p>
<p>vice a more honourable and upright man than
</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenfchaw, none more completely uncon-
</p>
<p>nected with the creditors of the nabob ; indeed
</p>
<p>when he received the order to make the enquiry
</p>
<p>he had not the most distant suspicion of the
</p>
<p>purpose for which it was set on foot.* As his re-
</p>
<p>port,however,was not favourable to the defence,
</p>
<p>it was of course suppressed,, though the counsel
</p>
<p>for the prosecution, who had become acquainted
</p>
<p>with the transaction,publicly challenged the law-
</p>
<p>officers of the company either to contradict the
</p>
<p>story or to produce Mr. Ravenshaw's letter.
</p>
<p>On this second trial, however, it was de-
</p>
<p>termined to make still greater exertions-;
</p>
<p>with this view Mr. Wm. Saunders,a servant of
</p>
<p>the company was deputed by government at
</p>
<p>the suggestion of their law-officers, to the dis-

<p>tricts where it had been proved, upon the trial,
</p>
<p>that AnnundaRowhad residedduringthe whole
</p>
<p>time it was alleged he was lit the Durbar at Ma-
</p>
<p>dras. His instructions were, to procure informa-
</p>
<p>tion upon the subject, and to send to Madras
</p>
<p>such persons as might appear tohim tobe neces-
</p>
<p>sary upon the trial. Veneatta Row, a witness for
</p>
<p>the defendants upon their trial, and employed
</p>
<p>as their agent upon this occasion, was dispatch-
</p>
<p>ed beforehand to the same village to prepare
</p>
<p>the inhabitants for his reception. Nay, even
</p>
<p>the defendant Annunda Row himself left the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the court where he was under
</p>
<p>recognizance, and with the knowledge of the
</p>
<p>law-officers repaired to the same place.
</p>
<p>The parties met at Manoorgudy, and fifteen
</p>
<p>or twenty miserable wretches were dispatched
</p>
<p>to give evidence upon the trial of Battley,,
</p>
<p>whom Veneatta Row and Annunda Row pro-
</p>
<p>duced to Mr, Saunders, prepared to declare to
</p>
<p>him, that they had never known the defendant
</p>
<p>Annunda Row. It 'is not the least extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary circumstance attending this strange pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, that Mr. Saunders should have gone
</p>
<p>to Manoorgudy in preference to Chillambrum,
</p>
<p>in quest of the desired information, considering
</p>
<p>that in the late trial it had been proved that An-
</p>
<p>nunda Row had resided some years at the lat-

</p>
<p>ter place, and only a few months at the former.
</p>
<p>27'
</p>
<p>The commissioners still contributed their
</p>
<p>aid, in concert with the law officers, to up-
</p>
<p>hold the defendants, Reddy Row, Annunda
</p>
<p>Row, and Mr. Battley; for instead of ac-
</p>
<p>knowledging their error, with regard to the
</p>
<p>integrity of the two former, they wrote a pub-
</p>
<p>lic letter to government, animadverting Upon
</p>
<p>the verdict of the jury, and upon the finding
</p>
<p>of the bills of indictment by the grand jury
</p>
<p>against Mr. Battley, recommending that the
</p>
<p>whole should be defended upon their trials by
</p>
<p>the law officers of government.
</p>
<p>Upon the 9th of January, Mr. Marsh, for
</p>
<p>the prosecution, was heard against the motion
</p>
<p>for a new trial in sessions, and particularly be-
</p>
<p>fore the same judge that presided at the trial;
</p>
<p>he argued also against the new trial, upon the
</p>
<p>ground of the jury being the only true consti-
</p>
<p>tutional judges of the facts, and of the credi-
</p>
<p>bility of the witnesses, stating that there was
</p>
<p>abundance of witnesses in sup port of the facts,
</p>
<p>not one of which had been impeached. He
</p>
<p>moved the court at the same time, for the com-
</p>
<p>mitment of the defendants. On these subjects,
</p>
<p>the chief justice, after eight days consideration,
</p>
<p>ruled " that it was competent to the court to
</p>
<p>entertain the motion for a new trial in sessions,
</p>
<p>but that as an appeal had been made to his de-

</p>
<p>licacy, he having presided at the past trial
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>he would hear it argued in term." He at the
</p>
<p>same time argued his right to exercise his dis-
</p>
<p>cretion as to the commitment of the defendants ;
</p>
<p>and he ordered them to be left at large upon
</p>
<p>their recognizances.*
</p>
<p>Upon the 20th of January came on before a
</p>
<p>special jury, summoned upon the motion of the
</p>
<p>counsel for the defendant, the trial of Mr. John
</p>
<p>Battley, for forgery, which lasted eight days.
</p>
<p>The evidence on this trial on the part of the
</p>
<p>prosecution, was the same as was adduced to-
</p>
<p>prove the issue in the former trial, with
</p>
<p>the addition of ten or twelve fresh witnesses
</p>
<p>from Chillarabrum and Manoorgudy. The evi-
</p>
<p>dence on the part of the defence was likewise
</p>
<p>the same as they had brought formerly
</p>
<p>with the addition of the fruits of the Ma-
</p>
<p>noorgudy mission. These witnesses preva-
</p>
<p>ricated and contradicted themselves so much,
</p>
<p>that their perjury, manifest to the jury, as
</p>
<p>well as to a numerous audience, served only to
</p>
<p>encrease the confusion of the defence.
</p>
<p>It is important here to remark, that Mada-
</p>
<p>puty Tremal Row, a witness for the defendants^
</p>
<p>the same that has been particularly mentioned
</p>
<p>in the account of the former trial, again most
</p>
<p>* See Appendix, No. 13, bring an account of these pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings, given by the agents for the creditors to the com-
</p>
<p>missioners appointed to examine into the nabob's debts, re-

</p>
<p>unequivocally swore that he had never seen
</p>
<p>Annunda Row in colonel Barrett's office, at
</p>
<p>the Durbar, at the same time that NarrainRow,
</p>
<p>a witness that had been called to prove all the
</p>
<p>papers in support of the defence upon the
</p>
<p>three trials, and who was proved to be in the
</p>
<p>same office at the Durbar, with Madaputy Tre-
</p>
<p>mal Row, as positively swore that he used to
</p>
<p>see Annunda Row there.
</p>
<p>In this trial the chief justice summed up
</p>
<p>immediately after Mr, Marsh had finished a
</p>
<p>very able reply. In the course of the observa-
</p>
<p>tions he directed to the jury, he dwelt greatly
</p>
<p>upon the weight due to the testimony of the
</p>
<p>witnesses that had been procured by the go-
</p>
<p>vernment mission to Manoorgudy ; the jury,
</p>
<p>however, after two hours consideration, re-
</p>
<p>turned a verdict of guilty, recommending the
</p>
<p>defendant to mercy,, on account of his former
</p>
<p>miimpeached character.*
</p>
<p>The court was then adjourned to the 6th of
</p>
<p>February, when the chief justice declared,
</p>
<p>" that the jury having recommended Battley
</p>
<p>to mercy, and his case being connected with
</p>
<p>that of the other two defendants, he should
</p>
<p>make his report upon all three to his majesty,
</p>
<p>and in the mean time leave them at large
</p>
<p>upon their recognizances/' This verdict, liow-

<p>ever, which entirely confirmed the former,
</p>
<p>had the effect of inducing the advocate -gene-
</p>
<p>ral to abandon his motions for a new trial,- and
</p>
<p>in arrest of judgment.
</p>
<p>A circumstance happened on this occasion,
</p>
<p>which perhaps more than any other displays
</p>
<p>the strong bias that throughout influenced the
</p>
<p>measures of government. At the conclusion of
</p>
<p>the trial, an application was made to govern-
</p>
<p>ment by Mr. Robert Ornie, and recommended
</p>
<p>by the commissioners, for the payment of 1300
</p>
<p>star pagodas, expended in the Manoorgudy
</p>
<p>mission, to defend a man convicted of perjury.
</p>
<p>This sum was immediately ordered to be
</p>
<p>paid, and charged upon the funds set apart for
</p>
<p>the benefit of the private creditors, though
</p>
<p>Sir George Barlow treated with contemptuous
</p>
<p>silence an application for reimbursement on
</p>
<p>the part of those creditors who at a great ex-
</p>
<p>pence had successfully detected these forgeries
</p>
<p>on the common property.
</p>
<p>To give a true picture of the scenes that
</p>
<p>occurred., it is also necessary to relate, that pre-
</p>
<p>vious to the commencement of this trial, it was
</p>
<p>proved upon the oath of Mr. John Tulloh, that
</p>
<p>his house had sold one-seventh share of the
</p>
<p>bond proved to be a forgery, to Mr. Aristru-
</p>
<p>ther, the advocate-general ; while on the former

</p>
<p>trial it had been proved on the evidence of Mr.
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>Brodie, that the bond had long ceased to be
</p>
<p>the property of Reddy Row. Astonished at
</p>
<p>these facs, recollecting that Reddy Row had
</p>
<p>deposed before the commissioners, that it was
</p>
<p>his pro, erty, not knowing what subornation
</p>
<p>to suspect, or how dignified the suborners might
</p>
<p>be, the prosecutors on the day after the con-
</p>
<p>viction, allied to the commissioners for copies
</p>
<p>pf certain informations taken by them in the
</p>
<p>ijivestjgationof Reddy Roy's claim. To which
</p>
<p>request the commissioners expressing their de-
</p>
<p>ference for the verdict of the special jury im-
</p>
<p>mediately acceded. Though three days after-,
</p>
<p>wards when the prosecutors applied for further
</p>
<p>papers which the commissioners had intimated
</p>
<p>to them through their writer, they might have,
</p>
<p>tjiey were refused, without any reason being
</p>
<p>assigned for it.*
</p>
<p>It will naturally be imagined that something
</p>
<p>very extraordiary must have intervened to oc-
</p>
<p>casion this sudden transition from the high
</p>
<p>respect for the verdict of a special jury, which
</p>
<p>the commissioners entertained on the 3d of Fe-
</p>
<p>bruary to their reducing that identical verdict
</p>
<p>below the level of their own opinion upon the
</p>
<p>7th of the same month ; and to induce them

<p>required.
</p>
<p>In fact the decision of the chief j ustice took
</p>
<p>place on the 6th of February, and a 'conference
</p>
<p>was immediately afterwards held between the
</p>
<p>commissioners and the advocate general. It is
</p>
<p>probable therefore that to the decision, and to
</p>
<p>what passed at this conference are to be
</p>
<p>ascribed this sudden alteration in the line of con-
</p>
<p>duct which they had adopted. Indeed, embol-
</p>
<p>dened by the language which fell from the
</p>
<p>bench, and probably urged by the advice of
</p>
<p>the advocate general, the commissioners on the
</p>
<p>same day made a formal complaint to the go-
</p>
<p>vernor in council against Messrs. Roebuck,
</p>
<p>Pany, Abbot and Maitland, for the impedi-
</p>
<p>ments and interruptions they had thrown in the
</p>
<p>way of their investigation, of which the very
</p>
<p>letter they had before replied to with so much
</p>
<p>cheerfulness and good will, is made the foun-
</p>
<p>dation, though they took no notice of their own
</p>
<p>letter of the 3d, which they had written in re-
</p>
<p>ply.*
</p>
<p>The January sessions were adjourned upon
</p>
<p>the 2d of February to the 23d, on account of

<p>the term, and again from the 23d of February

<p>promise was actually made between them ;
</p>
<p>and a warrant of attorney given to another so-
</p>
<p>licitor, Mr. Fownes Disney, the brother in law
</p>
<p>of Mr. Anstruther, the advocate-general, au-
</p>
<p>thorizing him to withdraw the indictment.
</p>
<p>An affidavit to these facts was filed in the
</p>
<p>supreme court, upon the 22d of February by
</p>
<p>Mr. Abbot and Mr. Light, and in consequence
</p>
<p>a rule to shew cause why an attachment
</p>
<p>should not issue against Mr. Battleyand Reddy
</p>
<p>Row was granted. This measure alarmed the
</p>
<p>parties, and put a stop to any further proceed-
</p>
<p>ings upon the compromise. The trial accord-
</p>
<p>ingly came on before a special jury, sum-
</p>
<p>moned upon the motion of the defendants on
</p>
<p>the 2d of March, and on the 6th, the jury re-
</p>
<p>turned a verdict of guilty against both defen-
</p>
<p>dants.
</p>
<p>In this trial it was proved on the part of the
</p>
<p>prosecution, that at the time of the late na-
</p>
<p>bob's death, Reddy Row owed to Venaigum
</p>
<p>Moodeliar the sum of 15,500 pagodas, that
</p>
<p>Venaigum pressed him for payment, and could
</p>
<p>not obtain it, that two or three months after-

<p>wards he brought an action of debt against
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>him in the supreme court, and took out a capias;
</p>
<p>that in order to avoid this process, Reddj Row
</p>
<p>sout himself up in his house, and remained in
</p>
<p>that state of confinement about nineteen months,
</p>
<p>during which time he had seen Venaigum once,
</p>
<p>and sent frequent mes>ages to him imploring
</p>
<p>him to withdraw the process against him ; that
</p>
<p>at the end of this time Venaigum was sent for
</p>
<p>to Mr. Battley's house, and that Mr. Battley
</p>
<p>begged l.-im to allow Reddy Row to come there
</p>
<p>without molestation, to which he agreed : that
</p>
<p>Reddy Row accordingly came there : and
</p>
<p>that Mr. Tattley produced to Venaigum
</p>
<p>a Persian paper, said to be a nabob's bond
</p>
<p>for pagodas l.>,500 in his own name, which
</p>
<p>they pretended Reddy Row had procured from
</p>
<p>the nabob ; that Mr. Battley assured him that
</p>
<p>the bond was a good and true one ; that he
</p>
<p>knew it to be so, and advised Venaigum to take
</p>
<p>it in satisfaction of Reddy Row's debt ; that the
</p>
<p>bond was translated by Mr. Battley into En-
</p>
<p>glish ; that it set forth that the money lent
</p>
<p>by Venaigum to Reddy Row had been applied
</p>
<p>as follows : viz. that 4500 pagodas had been
</p>
<p>paid to Mr. Fitzgerald the nabob's physician,
</p>
<p>on account of his tunkahs, and 11,000 pagodas
</p>
<p>to the payment of the Company's Kist, and
</p>
<p>that some days after two English receipts,

<p>written by Mr. Fitzgerald, for the amounts be-
</p>
<p>S3
</p>
<p>fore mentioned were given to him as vouchers ;
</p>
<p>but that the receipts bore dates prior to
</p>
<p>loan from Venaigum to Reddy Row; andtl
</p>
<p>when Venaigum remarked this, it was explained
</p>
<p>to him by Reddy Row, " that he had previously
</p>
<p>" borrowed money from other persons to pay
</p>
<p>" Mr. Fitzgerald, and had afterwards applied
</p>
<p>" the money borrowed from him to replace
</p>
<p>" those sums."
</p>
<p>Throughout his examination in chief, and
</p>
<p>upon his cross examination the prosecutor
</p>
<p>emphatically declared that he accepted the
</p>
<p>bond upon the assurance given him by Mr.
</p>
<p>Battley, that he knew it to be a good and true
</p>
<p>bond.
</p>
<p>During the time that Reddy Row was con-
</p>
<p>cealing himself, Chinniah Moodeliar, a na-
</p>
<p>tive of the first respectability, and having
</p>
<p>no interest whatsoever in the nabob's debts,
</p>
<p>proved that he had interposed his good offices
</p>
<p>between him and his creditors, and that when
</p>
<p>he advised the former to satisfy his credi-
</p>
<p>tors, by giving them security of nabob's or
</p>
<p>Rajah's bonds, he unequivocally declared that
</p>
<p>he had no such bonds.
</p>
<p>Tremal Row proved an interview at the
</p>
<p>Durbar soon after the death of the nabob,

</p>
<p>\vhcn it appeared that Reddy Row had no
</p>
<p>bond from the nabob, nor any security, but
</p>
<p>assignment upon the crops which had been
</p>
<p>umed by the company. Mr. W. D. Brodie,
</p>
<p>proved that he had acted some years as agent
</p>
<p>to Mr. Fordyce in collecting and transmitting
</p>
<p>to him the claims of creditors upon the nabob
</p>
<p>of the Carnatic, that a claim of Reddy Row's
</p>
<p>for pagodas 87,703, 23, 20 upon a balanc 6
</p>
<p>of an open account current had been prefer-
</p>
<p>red through him in July 1802 ; that he un-
</p>
<p>derstood that Reddy Row had no claims upon
</p>
<p>bonds at that time ; and that it afterwards ap-
</p>
<p>peared to him that the same balance was
</p>
<p>claimed a second time in the form of bonds.
</p>
<p>On the part of the defence, the truth of the
</p>
<p>bond was attempted to be established by the
</p>
<p>evidence of other Saucars who had lent money to
</p>
<p>Reddy Row, and who had at different periods
</p>
<p>subsequent to the death of the nabob, accepted
</p>
<p>bonds similar to that preferred to Venaigumin
</p>
<p>satisfaction* of their demands ; and by the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of Narrain Row, the same witness that
</p>
<p>proved the dufters in the former trials, who in
</p>
<p>like manner attempted to prove in the trials,
</p>
<p>several documents produced from the duf-
</p>
<p>ters in support of the bond. It appeared.,
</p>
<p>however., very clearly upon the cross examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the Saucars that they by no means ac-

</p>
<p>cepted the bonds from a conviction that they
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>were good and true nabob's bonds, but because
</p>
<p>they thought their debts desperate, and thai
</p>
<p>this was their only means of recovering any part
</p>
<p>of them. One of them after having prosecuted
</p>
<p>Reddy Row received a considerable portion of
</p>
<p>his debt in ready money : and all but one took
</p>
<p>written engagements from Reddy Row, to in-
</p>
<p>demnify them in case their nabob's bonds should
</p>
<p>not be passed. All too betrayed very great in-
</p>
<p>consistency in their depositions; and that of
</p>
<p>Veneram Dave in particular was a tissue of
</p>
<p>the most glaring contradictions and preva-
</p>
<p>rication from beginning to end. In a word
</p>
<p>it appeared manifestly that they were interest-
</p>
<p>ed in the acquittal of Reddy Row.
</p>
<p>Upon the second day of this trial an objec-
</p>
<p>tion was taken by the advocate general to the
</p>
<p>wording of the indictment, which described
</p>
<p>the prosecutor as Sadras Venaigum Moodel-
</p>
<p>liar, whereas the bond described him simply as
</p>
<p>Venaigum Moodelliar. The question was
</p>
<p>argued but not much at length, and the
</p>
<p>chief justice postponed the decision of the
</p>
<p>court upon it until the ensuing day, when
</p>
<p>he declared his opinion that the objection
</p>
<p>taken by the counsel for the defendant would
</p>
<p>be fatal to the indictment, but that it was not
</p>
<p>the proper stage of the trial in wliich to move
</p>
<p>it, unless the counsel for the prosecution would

<p>uig, and send in a new bill ,to the grand jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh being confident that the objection
</p>
<p>was futile, did not adopt the suggestion of the
</p>
<p>chief justice, and the event justified his dis-
</p>
<p>cernment. The trial went on, the advocate ge-
</p>
<p>neral indeed gave notice that he should move in
</p>
<p>arrest of judgment after the trial, if the ver-
</p>
<p>dict should be against him. The verdict was
</p>
<p>against him, he did not however move in arrest
</p>
<p>of judgment.
</p>
<p>When the verdict was pronounced, the
</p>
<p>counsel for the prosecution moved for the
</p>
<p>commitment of the defendants. The advocate-
</p>
<p>general opposed the commitment upon the
</p>
<p>ground of the notice which he had given that
</p>
<p>he should move in arrest of judgment. After
</p>
<p>a few moments consideration,, the chief justice
</p>
<p>declared that he must commit the defendants,
</p>
<p>unless the prosecutors consented to their re-
</p>
<p>maining at large : this was refused, the
</p>
<p>defendants were committed ; and the court was
</p>
<p>adjourned to Wednesday the 8th of March.
</p>
<p>From the commitment of the defendants,
</p>
<p>the prosecutors and the public were led to be-
</p>
<p>lieve that a third verdict pronounced against
</p>

<p>them. He had however a long interview with
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>the governor, Sir George Barlow, on Tuesday,
</p>
<p>the 7th of March: and 011 the following day when
</p>
<p>the defendants were brought up, the chief
</p>
<p>justice pronounced his resolution to refer this
</p>
<p>verdict, as he had done the two former ones,
</p>
<p>to his majesty, and to leave the defendants
</p>
<p>in the mean time at large upon their recog-
</p>
<p>nizances.
</p>
<p>Such was tlie effect of these three verdicts
</p>
<p>upon the mind of the chief justice, the judge
</p>
<p>could not agree that this triple conviction
</p>
<p>ought to abridge the liberty of lleddy Row,
</p>
<p>so neither did the commissioners admit that it
</p>
<p>ought to diminish his credibility. He conti-
</p>
<p>nued after three solemn verdicts against him
</p>
<p>to walk the streets of Madras in triumphant
</p>
<p>defiance, attended as usual at the office of the
</p>
<p>commissioners, and disposed by his evidence of
</p>
<p>that property against which he had directed
</p>
<p>the united efforts of perjury and illegal com-
</p>
<p>bination. It was for some time doubtful whe-
</p>
<p>ther the bond itself would not have been left
</p>
<p>in the hands of the commissioners ; and by
</p>
<p>them recommended for the sanction of the com-
</p>
<p>missioners in England : the chief justice con-
</p>
<p>tended that notwithstanding the verdicts of
</p>
<p>juries the commissioners were bound to recom-
</p>
<p>mend the bond as a good one, if they in their

<p>judgment deemed it to be so. Sir Benjamin
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>Sullivan, the other judge, delivered a totally
</p>
<p>opposite opinion, and to his opinion the chief
</p>
<p>.Justice at last subscribing, the bond was taken
</p>
<p>out of the custody of the commissioners and
</p>
<p>delivered up to the court*
</p>
<p>Thus the government of Madras embarked in
</p>
<p>three law suits in which they had not natu-
</p>
<p>rally the most distant concern, and after every
</p>
<p>influence of expence, intimidation, and irre-
</p>
<p>gular agency, had been tried in vain, found
</p>
<p>themselves defeated in all points ; but the
</p>
<p>government of Madras was not so constituted
</p>
<p>as to endure the fair restraints of justice with
</p>
<p>patience ; and the most severe and unheard-of
</p>
<p>revenge was prepared for those, who had been
</p>
<p>the instruments by which these restraints vver e
</p>
<p>imposed. The first victim to the irritated pas.

<p>sions of the government, was Mr. Benjamin

<p>Roebuck, mint- master, and military paymaster"

<p>general in both of which situations his conduct
</p>
<p>had been more than once highly commended by
</p>
<p>the government. This gentleman, near 60 years
</p>
<p>of age, who had served the company honour,
</p>
<p>ably for thirty-five years, was suddenly order-
</p>
<p>ed from Madra, where he had resided during

<p>the whole of his stay in India, deprived of

<p>gapatam five hundred miles from Fort
</p>
<p>St. George, with a salary reduced from 1009
</p>
<p>pagodas per month to 350. The manner in which
</p>
<p>this cruel transaction was carried into effect,
</p>
<p>is so very characteristic of the proceedings
</p>
<p>of the Madras government at that period ;
</p>
<p>and the letter of the unhappy man (who fore-
</p>
<p>saw his approaching death ), so simple and
</p>
<p>respectable, that both the mandate of Mr.
</p>
<p>Buchan and the last petition of Mr. Roebuck,
</p>
<p>before his decease,are well deserving of the most
</p>
<p>serious attention.*
</p>
<p>It seems natural to English feelings to sup-
</p>
<p>pose that the humble appeal of an old and ho-
</p>
<p>nourable servant of the East India compa-
</p>
<p>ny, might have met with some attention, and
</p>
<p>that it could not be considered as derogatory
</p>
<p>to the dignity of any colonial government to
</p>
<p>assign a cause for punishment, and to afford
</p>
<p>the opportunity of excuse and explanation
</p>
<p>before that punishment was inflicted. No
</p>
<p>answer was given to his petition, Mr. Roebuck
</p>
<p>was hastened away to Vizagapatam (and as

<p>every body foresaw would be the case) soon

</p>
<p>ven receded from that appeal the moment in
</p>
<p>which he had found it to be obnoxious to the
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>After the death of this truly amiable man,
</p>
<p>the next victim singled out was Mr. Parry,
</p>
<p>a respectable merchant who had resided
</p>
<p>above twenty years in Madras, and who as has
</p>
<p>before been stated had been selected by the bonS
</p>
<p>fide creditors of the nabob in common with
</p>
<p>Messrs. Roebuck, Abbot,andMaitland to watch
</p>
<p>over their interests, and prosecute any forgeries
</p>
<p>upon the fund set apart for the benefit of those
</p>
<p>who had really lent their money: if a merchant
</p>
<p>can in any manner be ruined, it must be by a
</p>
<p>sudden and peremptory exile from the scene
</p>
<p>of all his speculations and engagements ;
</p>
<p>Mr. Parry was accordingly ordered to embark

<p>43
</p>
<p>ginated entirely in misconception, it had never
</p>
<p>been acted upon and had been long since revok-
</p>
<p>ed. The pretence of its existence, however, was
</p>
<p>the plea upon which this order amounting to
</p>
<p>his total ruin was issued to Mr. Parry.
</p>
<p>Mr.Maitland was immediately after deprived

<p>of his office of justice of the peace,Mr. George

<p>the trials, or expressed opinions upon them
</p>
<p>were all deprived of their situations at Ma-

</p>
<p>oflndia,nor could the most .earnest prayers and
</p>
<p>entreaties of theso unfortunate gentlemen break
</p>
<p>through the silence of the government. In a
</p>
<p>moment they were mysteriously deprived of their
</p>
<p>station and their subsistence; the object seemed
</p>
<p>not only to punish but to goad with every spe-
</p>
<p>cies of mortification, and the alarming specta-
</p>
<p>cle was exhibited of an English government
</p>
<p>not calmly inflicting pain for the restraint of
</p>
<p>evil, but vindictively delighting in the amaze-
</p>

<p>misioaerg in London,
</p>
<p>As it appears impossible to justify this dis-
</p>
<p>turbance of public justice, and this system of
</p>
<p>juridical resentment upon any common princi-
</p>
<p>ples, recourse has been had by the agent of the
</p>
<p>Madras government (sent over for the express
</p>
<p>purposeofdefending the measures of Sir George
</p>
<p>Barlow) to the supposition of disaffection
</p>
<p>among the civil servants : and the whole of these
</p>
<p>trials are represented to have been a combina-
</p>
<p>tion against the wishes of Sir George Bar-
</p>
<p>low, an organized conspiracy of the civil ser-
</p>
<p>vants of the settlement to defeat the ends of jus-
</p>
<p>tice^and to bring the government into contempt.
</p>
<p>The difficulty in this supposition is to
</p>
<p>find any possible motive for such a com-
</p>
<p>bination. The conspirators (if any) were
</p>
<p>the bona fide creditors who were in the propor-
</p>
<p>tion of one to seven, to the ostensible creditors :
</p>
<p>the minority against the majority, the investi-
</p>
<p>gation of the guilt of Reddy Row was com-
</p>
<p>menced on the part of the prosecutors with the
</p>
<p>certain knowledge that some of the first peo-
</p>
<p>ple in the settlement were holders of forged
</p>
<p>bonds (purchased by them as real ones) to the
</p>
<p>amount of sixteen or seventeen lacks of pago-
</p>
<p>das. If ever there was an improbable ground
</p>
<p>'or a conspiracy it was a declaration to the
</p>
<p>community at large that six sevenths of a spe-

</p>
<p>was worth nothing at all, nor is it possible to
</p>
<p>understand how such a diminution of men's
</p>
<p>hopes, and such a destruction of their supposed
</p>
<p>property could be made rallying points for the
</p>
<p>disaffection of the settlement.
</p>
<p>If indeed the unhappy disposition of the
</p>
<p>government to interfere, when they had
</p>
<p>no natural interest, had taken an opposite
</p>

</p>
<p>the small number of real creditors against the
</p>
<p>widely extended forgeries by which the value

<p>of their property was diminished, there might

<p>then perhaps have been some risk of public

<p>irritation : but in these trials government
</p>
<p>took the part of the many against the few,

<p>and succeeded in turning mens minds to the

<p>side of justice, only because such interference

<p>of government, in any degree was deemed

<p>unjust and (as it was conducted) intolerable.

<p>If every thing which took place in these

<p>trials was the consequence of disaffection,

<p>why was Mr. Batley recommended to mercy

<p>by the jury? Why was the bill found against

<p>Poupiah ? Why did the second grand jury find

<p>another bill presented by the government offi-

<p>private creditors. The law officers succeeded
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>in two bills and failed in one. The private
</p>
<p>creditors succeeded in all three. It does not
</p>
<p>appear from all this bow there could be a
</p>
<p>disposition to refuse justice to the side espous-

<p>ed by the government, nor does there appear
</p>
<p>in such a statement sufficient reason why
</p>
<p>grand jurymen acting upon oath should be ex-
</p>
<p>posed to those vindictive punishments by which
</p>
<p>they were afterwards attacked.
</p>
<p>The sentiments of the petty juries were never
</p>
<p>put to the test bygovernment,for of the two bills
</p>
<p>of indictment found, which were psesented by
</p>
<p>their law officers, neither was prosecuted any
</p>
<p>farther. These trials, however,might have been

<p>made a mere pretence, and if the disaffection ex-

<p>isted, any cause, however trifling and insigni-

<p>ficant, might have been sufficient todevelopeit;
</p>
<p>a general system of economy recommended by

<p>the East India Company had been pursued by
</p>
<p>Sir George Barlow, and the discontent which

<p>this is said to have occasioned, has been repre-

<p>sented as the cause of that supposed disaffec-

<p>tion which is said to have displayed itself in

<p>the trials. It is remarkable, however, that of

<p>opposition, not one had sustained, or was
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>threatened with the slightest diminution of his
</p>
<p>income, or had the most trifling grievance of
</p>
<p>this nature to complain of. After this plain and
</p>
<p>indubitable fact, we ought to hear no more of
</p>
<p>disaffection produced by economy; of this econo-
</p>
<p>my, on the contrary, there was a very candid
</p>
<p>approbation in the settlement, proceeding from a
</p>
<p>conviction of its absolutenecessity. If Sir George
</p>
<p>Barlow had conducted himself with the same
</p>
<p>temper and discretion upon all other points as
</p>
<p>he did in carrying into effect the economical ar-
</p>
<p>rangements of the Company, Madras would still
</p>
<p>have been the same flourishing and happy set-
</p>
<p>tlement in which it was before its prosperity
</p>
<p>was consigned to his care.
</p>
<p>The conduct of the government in these trials,
</p>
<p>wants some extraordinary circumstances for its
</p>
<p>justification,the agents of thatgovernment clear-
</p>
<p>ly feel that unless they can set up some un-
</p>
<p>usual pretext for the extraordinary violence
</p>
<p>of which it has been guilty, that it must
</p>
<p>attract public attention, and recoil upon the
</p>
<p>heads of the aggressors. Every body knows
</p>
<p>that the army in India mutinied, and advan-
</p>
<p>tage is taken of our careless inspection into

<p>the affairs of the east, to disseminate a con-

<p>agitated state of government during the rau-

</p>
<p>tiny, by the necessity of keeping up its impor-
</p>
<p>tance, and by the ignorance in which he was*
</p>
<p>whether there might not be some connection
</p>
<p>between military revoU and civil opposition.
</p>
<p>But these civil differences began in the mid-
</p>
<p>dle of the year 1808. The mutiny did not break
</p>
<p>out till the middle of the year 1809. Informa-
</p>
<p>tion was laid of Reddy Row's forgery in July
</p>
<p>J808. The plaintiffs were threatened by go-
</p>
<p>vernment in October, the bill was found in the
</p>
<p>same month., the first verdict was given against
</p>
<p>government on the 9th of December, the second
</p>
<p>on the 28th of January 1809; and on the 13th
</p>
<p>of February 1809, it was first understood in the
</p>
<p>settlement that there was any species of dis-
</p>
<p>agreement between government and the com-
</p>
<p>mander in chief; before this period, there was not
</p>
<p>the most distant suspicion of such an event. So
</p>
<p>that government and the private creditors, the
</p>
<p>grand and petty juries had in the two first
</p>
<p>trials all resolved on, i and acted their respec-
</p>
<p>tive parts before this disagreement with the
</p>
<p>army had the shadow of existence, though this
</p>
<p>disagreement is relied upon to explain and to
</p>
<p>vilify the motives of those who were opposed
</p>
<p>to government in these trials.

<p>terminated as the othershad done.The indictment
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>was preferred before the grand jury on the
</p>
<p>October of the preceding year, and the ver-
</p>
<p>dict was given by the same special jury,
</p>
<p>which had been impanelled in the second cause.
</p>
<p>There never was in fact so shameless a de-
</p>
<p>fence of improper proceedings as this defence
</p>
<p>of the injustice of the Madras government,
</p>
<p>by the supposition of a combination between
</p>
<p>the civil and the military. There is no overt
</p>
<p>act which proves it, no secret connexion was
</p>
<p>ever brought to light, which regarded it: no
</p>
<p>letter was ever known to be sent, no meeting
</p>
<p>ever known to be held between these two de-
</p>
<p>scriptions of the company's servants. No in-
</p>
<p>dividual civilian was ever tried for it, or ever
</p>
<p>accused of it j Sir George Barlow has not in
</p>
<p>any of his public papers, made the most dis-
</p>
<p>tant allusion to it, nor is it mentioned by
</p>
<p>Lord Minto, who cannot be accused of omission
</p>
<p>in his publications relative to the late mutiny.
</p>
<p>It in fact was never heard of till it started up in
</p>
<p>this country as a plausible excuse for the scenes
</p>
<p>of injustice and oppression which were about
</p>
<p>to be developed: it then seems for the first time
</p>
<p>to have occurred that the way to make injur-
</p>
<p>ed men odious, was to call them disaffected.
</p>
<p>But to what purpose or for what object could

<p>this display of disaffection be made by large bo-

</p>
<p>the dominion of the company was destroyed,
</p>
<p>with it must perish all their hopes of acquiring

<p>There neverwas any body of agents so completely
</p>
<p>subjected to the power of their employers, and

<p>so completely identified with them in point of

</p>
<p>all would have been ruined: men with arms
</p>
<p>in their hands, are liable at all times to fits of

<p>irritation and excess, but to foster a general

<p>spirit of discontent among the civil servants

<p>Considering the violence of which he has

<p>dinary men commonly do fail) in th? choice of

<p>his advisers, and then in the choice of his

<p>measures; some little deference to men's feel-

<p>knowledge of their passions would have easily

<p>carried him through the trifling difficulties
</p>
<p>which presented themselves to his atten-

<p>routine of office to which he had been accus-

<p>tomed, and foreign to the notions of dignity
</p>
<p>which he had cherished ; whatever happened
</p>
<p>he had no .other resource than an order trans-

<p>mitted by the chief secretary ; if this failed he
</p>
<p>had recourse to another order, still more vio-

<p>lent and more ungracious ; and at last,was often

<p>driven for refuge to the borders of lawless vio-

<p>lence and outrage.

<p>praised all his measures; arid those who

<p>did not. Of the latter there was but one class:

</p>
<p>Address to the Governor in Council, from the Agents
</p>
<p>of the real creditors of the Nabob, stating the bad
</p>
<p>consequences which may arise from the interference
</p>
<p>of Government in the approaching Trials.
</p>
<p>To the Honourable Sir George Barlow, Bart, and
</p>
<p>K. B. Governor in Council.
</p>
<p>Honourable Sir,
</p>
<p>1. We hope we shall be excused for troubling your
</p>
<p>Honour in Council upon a subject in which the in-
</p>
<p>terests of those who are really creditors of the late
</p>
<p>nabobs of the Carnatic, is materially concerned,as well
</p>
<p>as, though more remotely, that of the Honourable
</p>
<p>the East India Company.
</p>
<p>2. It is a notorious fact that claims to an enormous
</p>
<p>amount have been laid before the commissioners ap-
</p>
<p>pointed to investigate the demands on the late nabobs
</p>
<p>of the Carnatic.to perhaps at least ten times more than
</p>
<p>those claims could have been estimated at, as was
</p>
<p>supposed by those who had the best means of form-
</p>
<p>ing an opinion on the subject.
</p>
<p>3. It is generally believed, that the greater part of
</p>
<p>the bonds upon which these claims have been made
</p>
<p>are forgeries : and as the real creditors have by the
</p>
<p>agreement entered into with the Honourable the
</p>
<p>East India Company, made considerable sacrifices
</p>

<p>question, to guard as far as they possibly can against
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>the admission of claims, by which the fair creditor
</p>
<p>of the late nabobs of the Carnatic may be deprived of
</p>
<p>tfie advantages of the fund appropriated for his re-
</p>
<p>lief, and by which the interests of the Honourable the
</p>
<p>East India Company may be ultimately materially
</p>
<p>affected
</p>
<p>4. A short time ago, a meeting of some of the
</p>
<p>creditors of the late nabobs of the Carnatic,who it was
</p>
<p>well known, had actually themselves had money trans-
</p>
<p>actions with the Durbar, was convened at the ex-
</p>
<p>change, when we were appointed, with others, to
</p>
<p>watch over their interests and those of the creditors
</p>
<p>in general, and to take such steps as we might deem
</p>
<p>advisable on the occasion.
</p>
<p>5. The first bond advertised by the commissioners
</p>
<p>for investigation, and claimed by Roya Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>one of the Serishtadars of the late nabob of the Car-
</p>
<p>natic, and at present in the service of his highness the
</p>
<p>nabob Azim ul Dowlah, and constantly in attendance
</p>
<p>with the commissioners, was challenged as a forgery.
</p>
<p>Informations to this effect were laid before the sitting
</p>
<p>magistrate, and Roya Reddy Row and a person called
</p>
<p>Anunda R.OW were committed, and gave bail for their
</p>
<p>appearance at the next sessions for the said forgery.
</p>
<p>6. On the 26th of July, pending the above men-
</p>
<p>tioned examinations at the public office, it was un-
</p>
<p>derstood that the commissioners acquainted the Sit-
</p>
<p>ting magistrate that they had addressed a letter to
</p>
<p>goveniment to request they would order their law
</p>
<p>officer to proceed against two of the witnesses who
</p>
<p>were then making their depositions against the said
</p>
<p>Roya Reddy Row and Anunda Row, for having per-
</p>
<p>jured themselves in giving evidence before the com-
</p>
<p>missioners, but the sitting magistrate conceiving that

<p>Public Domain / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd
</p>
<p>there was sufficient matter in the informations taken
</p>
<p>before him to commit the said Roya Reddy Row
</p>
<p>and Anunda Row, they were committed accord-
</p>
<p>ingly.
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>7. A few days afterwards it was publicly known;
</p>
<p>and certainly not without some degree of astonish-
</p>
<p>ment, that the law officer of government had actually
</p>
<p>commented proceedings against the two evidences
</p>
<p>alluded to in the letter of the commissioners, because
</p>
<p>it was, and certainly not unreasonably, supposed that
</p>
<p>those who came forward voluntarily to give evidence
</p>
<p>against claims produced before the commissioners,
</p>
<p>would rather have met with the support than the dis-
</p>
<p>approbation of government.
</p>
<p>8. Trusting, however, that the sitting magistrate
</p>
<p>would have allowed matters to take their regular
</p>
<p>course, we did not deem it necessary at the time to-
</p>
<p>state these facts to your honourable board.
</p>
<p>9. We have since been informed that the two wit-
</p>
<p>nesses above mentioned have been bound over to
</p>
<p>take their trial for the crime before stated, at the en-
</p>
<p>suing sessions.
</p>
<p>10. We therefore feel ourselves compelled to lay
</p>
<p>these particulars before your honourable board, and
</p>
<p>to submit whether such proceedings may not tend
</p>
<p>entirely to discourage natives from coming forward
</p>
<p>to question any claims however unfounded, and ii>
</p>
<p>fact, whether they are not likely to stifle enquiry and
</p>
<p>investigation altogether.
</p>
<p>11. Because when it is known publicly that Roya
</p>
<p>Reddy Row, the person who has made the claim or*
</p>
<p>the bond in question which is challenged as a forgery,,
</p>
<p>and for which he is bound over to take his trial at the
</p>
<p>next sessions has, notwithstanding, the support of the
</p>
<p>commissioners ; that the law officers of government
</p>
<p>have been directed to prosecute those who have given
</p>
<p>information against him, and that he is a confidential
</p>
<p>iervant of his Highness the nabob Azim at Dowlah,

<p>we cannot but entertain the most alarming appre-
</p>
<p>hensions, that all evidence from natives by which the
</p>
<p>forgeries can be brought to light, will be entirely
</p>
<p>ittL

</p>
<p>'are of a mild and timid disposition, and that the very
</p>
<p>idea of a contest in anyway with persons in high
</p>
<p>situations, whether Europeans or natives, is at all
</p>
<p>times sufficient to deter them from coining forward,
</p>
<p>even where their own immediate interests are con-
</p>
<p>cerned, much less so can they be expected to volun-
</p>
<p>teer their evidence in a matter wherein those interests,
</p>
<p>jperhaps, may not be at all implicated.

<p>The Governor's Reply to Messrs. Benjamin Roebuck,
</p>
<p>Thomas Parry, William Abbot.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I am directed by the honourable the Governor in
</p>
<p>Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
</p>
<p>the 20th ultimo, in which you have informed the
</p>
<p>Governor in Council, that you had been appointed to
</p>
<p>watch over the interests of certain creditors of the
</p>
<p>late nabobs of the Carnatic, and in which you have
</p>
<p>stated objections to the proceedings which it has
</p>
<p>been judged advisable to adopt, with regard to certain
</p>
<p>persons, (of the description of creditors) who are sup-
</p>
<p>posed to have been engaged in transactions of an illicit
</p>
<p>nature, and against whom a prosecution is in conse-

</p>
<p>quence about to be instituted.
</p>
<p>60
</p>
<p>The Governor in Council must be entirely precluded
</p>
<p>from acknowledging you in the capacity of the agents
</p>
<p><>l 'creditors who have not subscribed the paper which
</p>
<p>you have addressed to the governor, or who have nqt
</p>
<p>individually authorized it. Without however going
</p>
<p>at present into a farther discussion of the circum-
</p>
<p>stances which may have attended your nomination,
</p>
<p>the Governorin Council considers it sufficient to state,
</p>
<p>with reference to the professed object of your letter,
</p>
<p>that if. as individual creditors, you have reason to be-
</p>
<p>lieve that the commissioners for the investigation of
</p>
<p>the Caruatic claims had not sufficient grounds for the
</p>
<p>recommendation which has led to the prosecution of
</p>
<p>which you have complained, means will be used to
</p>
<p>obtain satisfaction on that point.
</p>
<p>The Governor in Council has no reason to doubt
</p>
<p>that the whole of the proceedings in question has been
</p>
<p>founded on the most correct principle ; and that its ac-
</p>
<p>curacy will be sufficiently evinced by any farther expla-
</p>
<p>nation which may take place. But it being at the same
</p>
<p>time the wish of the Governor in Council that all per-
</p>
<p>sons whose claims may be liable to the consideration
</p>
<p>of the commissioners, should have the full benefit of
</p>
<p>the comptrolling authority vested in the supreme
</p>
<p>government, I am directed to acquaint you that ap-
</p>
<p>plication will be made to the commissioners for copies
</p>
<p>of all papers connected with the question agitated in
</p>
<p>your4etter, and that copies of those papers with a copy
</p>
<p>of your letter will be submitted to the right honour-
</p>
<p>able the Governor in Council,if you should be desirous
</p>
<p>that this course should be adopted.

<p>I am, Gentlemen,

<p>Fort St. George, September 26th, 1808.
</p>
<p>From the same Agents in continuance to the Goveiv
</p>
<p>nor in Council, stating the private interest which the
</p>
<p>Law advisers of the Government have in the ap-
</p>
<p>proaching Trials.
</p>
<p>To George Buchan, Esq. chief Secretary to Govern-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>Sir,
</p>
<p>We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of
</p>
<p>your letter of the 17th instant, in which you inform
</p>
<p>us that we had stated to the honourable the Governor
</p>
<p>in Council,certain objections to the proceedings which
</p>
<p>it had been judged adyiseable to adopt with regard to
</p>
<p>certain persons (of the description of creditors) who
</p>
<p>are supposed to have been engaged in transactions of
</p>
<p>an illicit nature, and against whom a prosecution is in
</p>
<p>.conseq.uence about to be commenced.
</p>
<p>In reply to this part of ypiur letter we beg leave to
</p>
<p>observe that on reference to our address of the 20th
</p>
<p>ultimo we do not find any objections of the nature to
</p>
<p>which you allude, nor do we know of any prosecutions
</p>
<p>about to be entered into of the description yo* men-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>The circumstances which we were desirous of bring-
</p>
<p>ing under the consideration of government was alto-
</p>
<p>gether of a different complexion; a prosecution com-
</p>
<p>menced by the law officers of government in their of-
</p>
<p>ficial capacity not against persons of the description of
</p>
<p>creditors of the late nabobs of theCarnatic, but against
</p>
<p>two witnesses who had given informations before the
</p>
<p>sitting magistrate, on which certain persons had been,
</p>
<p>bound over to take their trial at the ensuing sessions

</p>
<p>for having forged or being concerned in the forgery Qf
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>a bond from his late highness the nabob, Omdell ul
</p>
<p>Omrah for a large sum of money, a proceeding into
</p>
<p>which we thought it probable government might inad-
</p>
<p>vertently have been led, and which we were appre-
</p>
<p>hensive might, on the grounds we then stated, be
</p>
<p>attended with consequences injurious to the interests
</p>
<p>of the fair creditors as well as those of the honourable
</p>
<p>the East India Company.
</p>
<p>This, sir, was the fact to which we deemed it in*
</p>
<p>cumbent on us to call the attention of government,
</p>
<p>and in doing so we were far from intending to blame
</p>
<p>or implicate any person whatever.
</p>
<p>We did not presume to question whether the com-
</p>
<p>missioners appointed to investigate the claims on the
</p>
<p>late nabobs of the Carnatic had or had not sufficient
</p>
<p>grounds for the recommendation which led to the pro-
</p>
<p>secution of the two witnesses in question. We were
</p>
<p>aware that those gentlemen are not in any way under
</p>
<p>the control of the government of Fort St. George,
</p>
<p>and that they have full power to adopt any measure
</p>
<p>which may appear to them to be best calculated to
</p>
<p>carry the duties of their office into effect; they there-
</p>
<p>fore had no doubt a right to select any person they
</p>
<p>thought proper to cariy on the prosecution they con-
</p>
<p>sidered it expedient to institute against the parties in
</p>
<p>question, but we humbly conceive it was by no means
</p>
<p>necessary that the law officers of government in their
</p>
<p>official capacity, should have been ordered to conduct
</p>
<p>the prosecution. No attempt was made by the parties
</p>
<p>prosecuted, to endanger the interest of the fair creditor,
</p>
<p>by imposing on the commissioners a spurious claim.
</p>
<p>On the contrary they had given evidence against a
</p>
<p>claim which they state to be of that description :
</p>
<p>should it appear hereafter their evidence is not true,

</p>
<p>the fund appropriated for the relief of those whose de-
</p>
<p>mands are just will not be injured ; on the other hand
</p>
<p>should the bond which has been opposed ultimately
</p>
<p>prove to be a forgeryj the fair creditor, and the ho-^
</p>
<p>nourable East India company will derive considerable
</p>
<p>benefit from the testimony of the parties now prose-.
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>cuted by the law officers of government and under
</p>
<p>their orders.
</p>
<p>Before we use the freedom of availing ourselves of
</p>
<p>the indulgence offered by government of applying to
</p>
<p>the commissioners for copies of all the papers having
</p>
<p>reference to the subject of our former letter, we have
</p>
<p>to request they will be pleased to favour us with a
</p>
<p>copy of such observations as may have been made on
</p>
<p>it by the advocate general, to whom we understand
</p>
<p>it has been submitted; in order that we may have an
</p>
<p>opportunity of replying to them, and that the whole
</p>
<p>affair may be brought forward in a regular manner
</p>
<p>to the notice of the right honourable the Governor
</p>
<p>general, and ultimately to the parliamentary commis-
</p>
<p>sioners, and the honourable the court of directors.
</p>
<p>We are the more anxious on this point, as we have
</p>
<p>some reason to believe that the report of the advocate
</p>
<p>general is not altogether free from inaccuracies and
</p>
<p>misrepresentations.
</p>
<p>In one particular, we know, he has mis-stated the
</p>
<p>fact, and he has said, alluding to the witnesses before
</p>
<p>mentioned, that Mr. Parry has become bail for them,
</p>
<p>to take their trial at the approaching sessions for per-
</p>
<p>jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Parry is not bail for these two witnesses, nor
</p>
<p>has he any connection with or knowledge of them
</p>
<p>whatever.
</p>
<p>In our address to government we abstained from re-
</p>
<p>marking on the situation in which the advocate general
</p>
<p>was placed in consequence of having stated himself to
</p>
<p>be a creditor of the late nabobs of the Carnatic; a fact
</p>
<p>which we understood to have been known to all the
</p>
<p>members of government, and which, we did suppose
</p>
<p>might have been a sufficient reason for considering

</p>
<p>him not altogether a fit person to give aji opinion on
</p>
<p>any matter in which the interests of the creditors iri
</p>
<p>general are concerned.
</p>
<p>It is a notorious fact that Mr. Anstruther cannot
</p>
<p>possibly be a creditor of the late nabobs of the Car-
</p>
<p>natic in his own right, and that if he actually be a
</p>
<p>creditor, it must be as a speculator.
</p>
<p>It is also generally believed that many of the pur-
</p>
<p>chases in which he is concerned, and which are sup-
</p>
<p>posed to be to a large amount, have been made
</p>
<p>through Reddy Row, the person we have already had 1
</p>
<p>occasion so frequently to mention, or on his recommen-
</p>
<p>dation; and it therefore may be fairly inferred, that he
</p>
<p>feels more than common interest in the prosecutions
</p>
<p>which are now depending.
</p>
<p>We have thought it necessary to state these circum-
</p>
<p>stances for the information of the board, because we
</p>
<p>conceive, that although they may have understood
</p>
<p>generally that Mr. Anstruther was a creditor of the late
</p>
<p>nabobs of the Carnatic, we do not suppose they can
</p>
<p>have been acquainted with the nature and description
</p>
<p>of his claims.
</p>
<p>In consequence of your having informed us by your
</p>
<p>letter of the 17th instant, that the honourable the
</p>
<p>Governor in Council does not think proper to recognize
</p>
<p>us as a committee for the bona fide creditors of;the late
</p>
<p>nabobs of the Carnatic, we now take leave to present
</p>
<p>ourselves individually as such.
</p>
<p>We have the honour to be, Sir,
</p>
<p>Your most obedient humble servants,

</p>
<p>PUBLIC DEPARTMENT.
</p>
<p>Oovernor's Reply threatening these Gentlemen if they
</p>
<p>proceed.
</p>
<p>To Messrs. Benjamin Roebuck, Thomas Parry and
</p>
<p>William Abbot.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>1. I am directed by the honorable the Governor m
</p>
<p>Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
</p>
<p>the 2Gth ultimo.
</p>
<p>2. The Governor in Council thinks it unnecessary to
</p>
<p>go at present into a further explanation of the nature
</p>
<p>of the illicit transactions, which were alluded to in
</p>
<p>the letter addressed to you on the 17th ultimo, or of
</p>
<p>the proceedings which those transactions may render
</p>
<p>it expedient to adopt, as the explanation does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear essential.
</p>
<p>3. The particular object of the letter addressed to
</p>
<p>you on the 17th ultimo, was for the purpose of making
</p>
<p>known to you, that if you should have any cause for
</p>
<p>questioning the propriety of thelmeasures adopted by the
</p>
<p>commissioners for investigating theCarnatic claims,the
</p>
<p>Governor in Council was present to afford any assist-
</p>
<p>ance that might be necessary in bringing the subject
</p>
<p>under the notice of the authorities, which are legally
</p>
<p>intitled to take cognizance of questions of that na-
</p>
<p>ture. The Governor in Council however observes in
</p>
<p>your present letter, that you disavow an intention of
</p>
<p>bringing into question the grounds of the recommen-
</p>

</p>
<p>dation of the commissioners which have formed the
</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>subject of your recent communications; but that you
</p>
<p>have thought it necessary to question the propriety
</p>
<p>of the orders of the Governor in Council expressly
</p>
<p>founded on that recommendation.
</p>
<p>4. The Governor in Council has attentively reviewed
</p>
<p>the proceedings connected, with the subject, and it
</p>
<p>appear? manifestly established from the facts which
</p>
<p>have been stated, that no other course could have
</p>
<p>been taken than that which has been adopted, on,
</p>
<p>the recommendation of the commissioners repressing
</p>
<p>the dangerous efforts which have been made to ob-
</p>
<p>struct the cause of their enquiry, and to place in dif-
</p>
<p>ficulty the persons instrumental in facilitating its
</p>
<p>progress. In these circumstances the Governor in
</p>
<p>Council must necessarily consider the tenor of your
</p>
<p>communications to be in the highest degree impro-
</p>
<p>per.
</p>
<p>5. The Governor in Council considers the mode in
</p>
<p>which you presume to discuss the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>government, and your application for the official
</p>
<p>paper to which you allude, to be an aggravation of
</p>
<p>your disrespectful conduct. The explanation con-
</p>
<p>veyed in the letter addressed to you on the 17th
</p>
<p>ultimo, was founded on distinct grounds, and was
</p>
<p>unconnected with any reference to that paper, (to
</p>
<p>which it is proper to notice that you could have had
</p>
<p>no regular means of access) and the Governor in
</p>
<p>Council must therefore consider your observations on
</p>
<p>that point to be irrelevant to the professed object of
</p>
<p>your letter.
</p>
<p>6. I am directed to repeat, that if there is any
</p>
<p>matter of real or supposed objection connected with
</p>
<p>the proceedings of the commissioners, which you
</p>
<p>may be desirous of bringing under the notice of the

<p>The Agents reply to George Buchan, Esq. chief
</p>
<p>Secretary to Government.
</p>
<p>Sir,
</p>
<p>1. However desirous we might have been of replying
</p>
<p>to your letter, of the 5th of October, to Mr. Roebuck
</p>
<p>and ourselves, in order to remove as far as we possibly
</p>
<p>eould the unfavourable impressions which the ho-
</p>
<p>nourable the Governor in Council appeared to have re-
</p>
<p>ceived regarding our conduct as to the communications
</p>
<p>we had deemed it incumbent on us to make in our
</p>
<p>addresses of the 20th of August and 26th September
</p>
<p>last : we considered it adviseable to wait the result of
</p>
<p>the trials, which were to take place at the October
</p>
<p>sessions, before we intruded ourselves again on their
</p>
<p>notice.
</p>
<p>2. We are indeed much concerned to find from your

</p>
<p>letter that our former communications had been con.
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>sidered disrespectful and improper. We beg leave
</p>
<p>most solemnly to declare that nothing could be far-
</p>
<p>ther from our intentions than to offend government,
</p>
<p>or bring forward improper information to their notice;
</p>
<p>for them and for their acts, we have that high respect,
</p>
<p>to which from those, who live under their authority,
</p>
<p>and enjoy their protection, they are so justly en-
</p>
<p>itled.
</p>
<p>3. In answer to the last paragraph of your letter
</p>
<p>we trust we shall stand excused for observing that
</p>
<p>we are apprehensive some communications not
</p>
<p>founded in truth have been made to government, as
</p>
<p>to the motives which influenced our conduct, and
</p>
<p>which have drawn forth the expressions which we
</p>
<p>cannot but consider severe, and which we know we
</p>
<p>have not deserved.
</p>
<p>4. We request you will assure theHonourable the Go-
</p>
<p>vernor in Council, that we have not in any way, either
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly obstructed the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>commissioners appointed to investigate the claims on
</p>
<p>the late Nabobs of the Camatic.
</p>
<p>5. It is true that Mr. Abbot waited frequently on
</p>
<p>the commissioners, anxious to give them information
</p>
<p>respecting the claim which had been preferred before
</p>
<p>them by Reddy Row, which he believed ta be a for-
</p>
<p>gery, but he was not aware that he thereby in any
</p>
<p>way obstructed their proceedings.
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Parry had the honour of appearing before
</p>
<p>the commissioners only once on the subject of the
</p>
<p>claim in question, and he attended at their own re-
</p>
<p>quest He has not either directly or indirectly in-
</p>
<p>terfered or communicated with them further respecting
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>7. Mr. Roebuck we believe, has never attended the

<p>rommissioners to be examined.
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>8. We shall n ow take the liberty of stating for the
</p>
<p>information of government, the result of the prose-,
</p>
<p>cution, which we thought it incumbent on us to bring
</p>
<p>under their notice, in our letter of the 20th August.
</p>
<p>9. The bills of indictment preferred by the law of-
</p>
<p>ficers of government at the instigation of the commis-
</p>
<p>sioners against Bearnah Row and Arnachilla Row for
</p>
<p>forgery, were thrown out by the grand jury.
</p>
<p>10. Roya Reddy Row and Anunda Row have been
</p>
<p>found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the private
</p>
<p>creditors of the late nabobs of the Carnatic, and the
</p>
<p>honourable the East India Company, by means of
</p>
<p>a bond forged by them of the late Nabob Oomdul ul
</p>
<p>Omrah.
</p>
<p>11. And a bill of indictment has been found, by
</p>
<p>the grand jury against Roya Reddy Row, and Mr.
</p>
<p>J. Battley, secretary to his highness the nabob Azim
</p>
<p>ul Dowlah, for a conspiracy and fraud, and another
</p>
<p>bill of indictment against the said Mr. J. Battley for
</p>
<p>perjury, which bills of indictment lie over for trial at
</p>
<p>the ensuing sesions.
</p>
<p>12. We hope that the honourable the Governor in
</p>
<p>Council will now be satisfied that RoyaReddy Row and
</p>
<p>the parties with whom he is connected are not persons
</p>
<p>deserving of that support which has been given to them.
</p>
<p>We have the honour to be,
</p>
<p>Sir,
</p>
<p>Your most obedient humble Servants,

<p>CQpy Letter from Hussam Ul Mulk, to Sir Thomaa
</p>
<p>Strange, Chief Justice, relative to the trial of Roy a
</p>
<p>Reddy Row.
</p>
<p>(After the usual compliments.)
</p>
<p>I have received two subpoenas from the supreme
</p>
<p>court requiring my attendance with the accounts,
</p>
<p>&c. during the administration of Anwar Alee Khan,
</p>
<p>late Amildar of theSoobah of Arcot, during the space
</p>
<p>of one month and twenty-seven days in the year
</p>
<p>1207, Fusiee. As I have been indisposed for one
</p>
<p>month, I have sent the accounts in my possession by
</p>
<p>Madhoo Row, Serishtadar of Arcot; and the in-
</p>
<p>closed paper under my seal and signature contains a
</p>
<p>statement of circumstances respecting the account of
</p>
<p>the money received during the administration of
</p>
<p>Anwar Alee Khan, for your information.
</p>
<p>Seal
</p>
<p>Hussam Ul
</p>
<p>Mulk.
</p>
<p>The circumstances respecting the accounts of the
</p>
<p>whole receipts of the money received during the
</p>
<p>administration of Anwar Alee Khan are these. In
</p>
<p>the year 1207, 1 1 uslee, when on the removal of Anwar
</p>
<p>Alee Khan theSoobah of Arcot was intrusted to my
</p>
<p>charge by his highness the Nucomb Oomdul ul Omra
</p>
<p>Syyid Moortaza Hoosyn Khan by my directions had
</p>
<p>the said account prepared for me by Anunda Row
</p>
<p>and Appro Row Serishtadars of Anwar Alee Khan
</p>
<p>and sent it with their signatures affixed thereto to me.
</p>
<p>The account does not bear the seal of Anwar Alee

</p>
<p>Khan, because he was at that time in the presence.
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>The account has been with me till now, except that
</p>
<p>four months ago at the request of Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>Mootoosuddie of the said account, I sent it to him
</p>
<p>by the hands of Meer Talib Alee Khan and Syyid
</p>
<p>\eckim. In that account the loan of Gopal Row to
</p>
<p>the amount of thirty-five thousand pagodas is not
</p>
<p>entered. The copy of it under my signature, which
</p>
<p>is in the possession of Madhoo Row, Serishtadar of
</p>
<p>Arcot, is conformable to the original.
</p>
<p>Dated 21st of Rumuzan, A. H. 1223.
</p>
<p>Memorandum to serve as an explanation of the above
</p>
<p>Letter of Hussam Ul Mulk.
</p>
<p>Roya Reddy Row stated in his information upon
</p>
<p>oath before the commissioners that his claim was
</p>
<p>founded upon a loan of 35,000 pagodas to Anwar
</p>
<p>A lee Khan, the renter of the Arcot district in the year
</p>
<p>1797 for account of the Circar by Gopal Row. In
</p>
<p>support of this allegation, an account was produced
</p>
<p>from the dufters, purporting to be the account of
</p>
<p>Anwar Alee Khan rendered to the Circar, in which
</p>
<p>this pretended loan by Gopal Row was entered. On
</p>
<p>the part of the prosecution it was contended that this
</p>
<p>account was a fictitious one; that in fact Anwar
</p>
<p>Alee Khan never did render any accounts of his
</p>
<p>management to the Circar, that he only continued
</p>
<p>renter fifty-seven days, was then turned out and was
</p>
<p>succeeded in the rentership by Husam Ul Mulk ;
</p>
<p>that Hussam Ul Mulk made up the accounts of
</p>
<p>Anwar Alee Khan's management, as well as his own,
</p>
<p>and transmitted them to Hussam Ul Mulk, and that
</p>
<p>there was no entiy whatever of this loan in Anwar
</p>
<p>Alee Khan's account, nor any mention of money
</p>
<p>transactions with Roya Reddy Row or Gopal Row.
</p>
<p>It was likewise alleged that Roya Reddy Row had

</p>
<p>borrowed these accounts from Hussam Ul Mulk,
</p>
<p>at some time before the commissioners commenced
</p>
<p>their investigation of claims, and from them had
</p>
<p>L
</p>
<p>74
</p>
<p>fabricated the false accounts in which the loan to
</p>
<p>Anwar Alee Khan was introduced. The true ac-
</p>
<p>counts never wore restored to Hussaiid Ul Mulk,
</p>
<p>hut he fortunately had two tets of them, of which
</p>
<p>Roya Reddy Row most probably was ignorant. To
</p>
<p>prove these allegations Hussam Ul Mulk was
</p>
<p>subpoenaed upon the trial, but instead of obeying the
</p>
<p>summons he wrote upon thethird or fourth uay of the
</p>
<p>trial a letter to the Chief Justice of which the accom-
</p>
<p>panying is a faithful translation. Hussam Ul Mulk
</p>
<p>Serestadar Madhoo Row attended with the true
</p>
<p>accounts, and was competent to prove them, but the
</p>
<p>admission of these accounts in evidence was strenu-
</p>
<p>ously opposed by the counsel for the defence, and
</p>
<p>refused by the Chief Justice. Had they been ad-
</p>
<p>mitted and believed by the jury, they would them-
</p>
<p>selves have convicted the defenders of the forgery.

</p>
<p>Madras, 14th January, 1809.
</p>
<p>To the Commissioners for investigating the debts of
</p>
<p>the late Nabobs of the Carnatic, London.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>1. You will no doubt have heard when this reaches
</p>
<p>you of the enormous and preposterous amount of the
</p>
<p>claims preferred before the commissioners in India.
</p>
<p>You will, therefore, not be surprised to hear that re-
</p>
<p>sistance has been made to suspicious claims, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing they may have been supported by very pow-
</p>
<p>erful interest.
</p>
<p>2. The accompanying packet, which we beg leave
</p>
<p>to recommend to your attentive perusal, will make you
</p>
<p>acquainted with our proceedings hitherto.
</p>
<p>3. In addition to the information contained in the
</p>
<p>accompanying documents, we beg leave to state to-
</p>
<p>you, what we could not properly introduce into the
</p>
<p>memorial, that regarding more particularly the con-
</p>
<p>duct of the commissioners in India.
</p>
<p>4. It appeared from the examination of Mr. Brodie
</p>
<p>upon the trial, that the only claim which Roya Reddy
</p>
<p>Row had upon the nabob was for a balance of pagodas
</p>
<p>87,703 : 23 ; 20, upon an open account current, which

</p>
<p>claim was assigned over to Duttijer Morleapah, and
</p>
<p>77
</p>
<p>by him forwarded to Mr. Fordyce through Mr.
</p>
<p>Brodie.
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Brodie further deposed, that when the
</p>
<p>claim was forwarded through him, he understood it
</p>
<p>was the only one which RoyaReddy Row had, and in
</p>
<p>fact, he had no bonds from the nabob whatsoever.
</p>
<p>But that at a subsequent period other claims upon
</p>
<p>bonds were forwarded through him by persons acting
</p>
<p>asattornies for Roya Reddy Row, which struck him
</p>
<p>as something so mysterious that he took copies of the
</p>
<p>assignments and powers of attorney.
</p>
<p>6. Roya Reddy Row had no bonds, was confirmed
</p>
<p>by another witness, Zurial Row, who was present
</p>
<p>shortly after the present nabob ascended the Musnud,
</p>
<p>when Roya Reddy Row submitted the above men-
</p>
<p>tioned open account current to the nabob, pressing
</p>
<p>him to use his interest with the company to release a
</p>
<p>quantity of paddy which had been assigned over to
</p>
<p>him in the Tinnivelly country by Omdul Ul Omrah, as
</p>
<p>security for his debt, and which had been seized by
</p>
<p>government when the country was ceded to it by
</p>
<p>treaty, and representing his deplorable condition, that
</p>
<p>he had no other securities for his balance but the above
</p>
<p>mentioned paddy.
</p>
<p>7. It was likewise corroborated by the evidence
</p>
<p>of Chinniah Moodelliar, who more than eleven months
</p>
<p>after the death of Omdul Ul Omrah, and when Roya
</p>
<p>Reddy had been conceal ing himself, shut upinhis house
</p>
<p>for some months in order to elude a writ of bailable pro-
</p>
<p>cess laid out against him by Venaigum Moodelliar for
</p>
<p>a debt of pagodas 15,500, interposed his friendly me-
</p>
<p>diation, and advised Roya Reddy Row to satisfy Ve-
</p>
<p>naigum by giving him feome security for his debt. He
</p>

<p>gum some of his nabob's bonds if he had any as secu-
</p>
<p>rity, when Roya Reddy Row unequivocally declared
</p>
<p>to him that he had none.
</p>
<p>78
</p>
<p>Sth. Notwithstanding this Roya Reddy Row has
</p>
<p>preferred claims, independantof the balance of the open
</p>
<p>account current, to the amount of pagodas 304 ,042, 17 ;
</p>
<p>40, of which we inclose a memorandum. And it ap-
</p>
<p>peared upon the trial, and what is more extraordinary,
</p>
<p>it appeared from Roya Reddy Row's own showing,
</p>
<p>that the balance of pagodas 87, 703, 23, 40, due to him
</p>
<p>by the nabob was made up of several sums which he
</p>
<p>had borrowed from different soucars: and he pretend-
</p>
<p>ed that he had received during the life time of the Omul,
</p>
<p>bonds in the name of the several soucars for the
</p>
<p>amount of their respective demands, that with these
</p>
<p>bonds he had satisfied these creditors, and his balance
</p>
<p>of pagodas 87,703, 23, 20, was notwithstanding
</p>
<p>claimed by his pretended assignee Duttajee Morleah,
</p>
<p>so that by his own showing upon the trial it appeared
</p>
<p>at least, that this balance was claimed twice ovef.
</p>
<p>However incredible this may appear to you, and that
</p>
<p>this defence should be conducted by the law officers
</p>
<p>of the company, openly assisted by the commission-
</p>
<p>ers, yet you will be satisfied of the truth of it when
</p>
<p>you read the trial which we are endeavouring to get
</p>
<p>published here,and which at any rate you shall receive
</p>
<p>in manuscript if we cannot obtain permission to print
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>P. Independent of these two sums, viz. the balance
</p>
<p>of the open account pagodas 87,703 23 20, and the
</p>
<p>soucars bonds, viz. Moorli Doss, pagodas 6000, Coloor

<p>Vincata Narrain, 4000, Visvinada Tawker 21,40O, Vi-

</p>
<p>3,300, Poojunga Row 1000, which if they are not for-
</p>
<p>geries, ought to represent, and were given in payment
</p>
<p>of the above balance, you will see that this man claims as

<p>above stated pagodas 314,042 17 40, of which pagodas
</p>
<p>176,954 17 40, is stated to have been lent to the nabob
</p>
<p>in the course of the month of June immediately pre-
</p>
<p>ceding his death, and after he had been declared to be
</p>
<p>past recovery. Mr. Cockburn, who was at Madras at
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>the time, can acquaint his. colleagues in what state the
</p>
<p>nabob was, and whether he believes it possible that a
</p>
<p>native of India conversant in all the transactions of the
</p>
<p>Durbar, would lend to the nabob upon his death bed
</p>
<p>the enormous sum of pagodas 176,954 17 40 without
</p>
<p>other security than his simple bonds. Weare persuaded
</p>
<p>that Mr. Cockburn would not believe such a thing if
</p>
<p>five hundred living witnesses should depose to the
</p>
<p>truth of it, and if five thousand written documents
</p>
<p>should start up from the Dufters to support it. The
</p>
<p>bonds being in different names argues nothing either
</p>
<p>way, for Mr. Cockburn can inform you this is a com-
</p>
<p>mon practice among the natives that they may not ap-
</p>
<p>pear to possess much wealth of their own.
</p>
<p>10. Venaigum is prosecuting Roya Reddy Row
</p>
<p>and Mr. Batley for the fraud and conspiracy in passing
</p>
<p>upon him the pretended fraud for pagodas 15,500. The
</p>
<p>other soucarsare in the interest of Roya Reddy Row,
</p>
<p>gained over no doubt by a promise of getting their
</p>
<p>bonds passed by the commissioners.
</p>
<p>1 1 . Excessive as the amount of these fraudulent
</p>
<p>claims is, it is a trifle, a mere nothing compared to the
</p>
<p>whole amount of bonds that this man is said to have
</p>
<p>forged or given certificates for. We are informed, and
</p>
<p>we have reason to believe, that the bonds sold by him
</p>
<p>and by his recommendation to the law officers and
</p>
<p>their associates, viz. Mr. George Arbuthriot, Messrs.
</p>
<p>Binny and Dennison, the late Mr. Walter Grant, Doc-
</p>
<p>tor Andrew Berry, Mr. George Hally burton, and
</p>
<p>others, although none are claimed in the names of the
</p>
<p>law officers amount to sixteen or seventeen lacks of
</p>
<p>pagodas. Mr. Orme alone claims upon bonds amount-
</p>
<p>ing to Gil, 000 pagodas, on account of the estate of the
</p>
<p>late Mr. Walter Grant, the whole of which were pur-

</p>
<p>in suborning witnesses for a new trial if granted, and

<p>for Mr. Batley's trial. The sessions is at present ad-
</p>

<p>to pronounce whether he will commit them to jail,
</p>
<p>or by a further exercise of his own discretion, sutler
</p>
<p>them to remain at large.
</p>
<p>12. We say nothing of the hond in favour of , Go-
</p>
<p>pal Row for 88,500pagodas,becauseweare persuaded
</p>
<p>that a trial of sixteen days and a verdict of an English
</p>
<p>jury will stamp its discredit for ever, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>all the endeavours of the law officers to uphold it
</p>
<p>13. We have just heard from the printer that go-
</p>
<p>vernment has refused him permission to print the trial,
</p>
<p>we shall therefore send it in manuscript to be printed
</p>
<p>in London. We annex a copy of our correspondence
</p>
<p>regarding it. This is a singular circumstance.

<p>14. Aradaunum Paupiah Braminy who commenced
</p>
<p>the prosecution against Roya Reddy Row, died on the
</p>
<p>10th instant, Roya Reddy Row and his party arenow
</p>
<p>using all their endeavours to buy over some of^ie
</p>
<p>witnesses who appeared, against him on the former
</p>
<p>trial. This seems to be their only hope, and to effect
</p>
<p>what they have in view, nothing will be left undone
</p>
<p>that money and the most powerful influence and inter-
</p>
<p>est can accomplish.

<p>at present, and we sincerely hope that such measures
</p>
<p>will be taken in this country as will prevent the ne-
</p>
<p>cessity of troubling you again.

<p>You will perhaps be surprised to hear that after two

<p>more successive adjournments of the sessions, viz. from

<p>motions before him, where the one on the part of the
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>defence for a new trial he has ruled that it ought to be
</p>
<p>argued in term, the other on the part of the prosecution
</p>
<p>for the commitment of the defendants he has dis-
</p>
<p>charged, declaring his resolution to leave them at
</p>
<p>large upon their recognizance, without assigning any
</p>
<p>one reason for such measure, or stating any one cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance in the case of the defendants that entitle
</p>
<p>them to such extraordinary indulgence, but simply
</p>
<p>asserting his right and power to do so. Thus two
</p>
<p>men convicted upwards of seven weeks ago of a crime
</p>
<p>for which in England they would before now have
</p>
<p>suffered a capital punishment are left at liberty, an
</p>
<p>apparent example to the natives of the inemcacy of
</p>
<p>our laws in this country when opposed by wealth,
</p>
<p>power, and influence. We shall not now be surprised
</p>
<p>if all the native witnesses for the prosecution of
</p>
<p>Reddy Row, as well those that gave testimony
</p>
<p>upon the late trial, as those summoned for the ap-
</p>
<p>proaching one should abscond, seeing the powerful
</p>
<p>protection that he enjoys, and fearing thence the effects
</p>
<p>of his vengeance for daring to depose the truth against
</p>
<p>him. Living as you do, gentlemen, in a country where
</p>
<p>the laws are equally and impartially administered to
</p>
<p>all ranks of people, you can have no conception how
</p>
<p>little the natives of the East confide in them. For
</p>
<p>some time anterior to, and during the trial of Reddy
</p>
<p>Row their uniform language was, that there was no
</p>
<p>doubt of the man's guilt, nor of his having committed
</p>
<p>many other forgeries and frauds, but that enjoying
</p>
<p>the favour and protection of the commissioners, the
</p>
<p>law officers of the company, the nabob and the go-
</p>
<p>vernment, we should never be able to convict him ;
</p>
<p>when however we did convict him, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the weight of influence that we had to contend

<p>against, their opinion and language began to change,
</p>
<p>they began to understand the importance of a trial by
</p>
<p>jury, and to venerate it. But now, alas! that they
</p>
<p>find that a man may be tried and convicted by a jury

<p>and still appear to escape the penal consequences of

<p>his guilt, they recur to their original and native belief,

<p>in the present instance the evidence on the trial of Mr.

<p>Reddy'Row are entirely innocent of the charges on
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>which they were indicted ; under other circumstances
</p>
<p>they might not have thought proper to avow this opi-
</p>
<p>nion, but they are encouraged in the present instance
</p>
<p>by the similar sentiments of the chief justice himself,
</p>
<p>the tendency of whose charge was strongly for the ac-
</p>
<p>quittal of Mr. Batley : and he has signified his reso-
</p>
<p>lution to submit the two verdicts, with his own report
</p>
<p>and observations on the respective trials to the wisdom
</p>
<p>and consideration of the king. Since the trial, a letter
</p>
<p>has been received from Messrs. Parry, Abbott, and
</p>
<p>Maitland, for copies of papers with an obscure and
</p>
<p>indefinite expression of their intention to proceed to
</p>
<p>further prosecution, the object of which is easily con-
</p>
<p>jectured. The advocate for the prosecution has dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly and unreservedly menaced the commissioners,
</p>
<p>that if they shall make a favourable report of the bond
</p>
<p>claimed by Reddy Row to the commissioners at home,
</p>
<p>he would render them the object of a criminal prose-
</p>
<p>cution. These trials have impeded our public trans-
</p>
<p>actions, and the further prosecutions with which
</p>
<p>we are threatened, or any other measures calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to oppose our proceedings, we contemplate as
</p>
<p>the complete and effectual obstruction of our official
</p>
<p>duty. We therefore distinctly and unreservedly state
</p>
<p>to the governor in council that unless measures are
</p>
<p>adopted by government to relieve us from embarrass-
</p>
<p>ments from persons avowedly the prosecutors,it will be
</p>
<p>impracticable for us to proceed with immediate effect,
</p>
<p>or with any ulterior success in the discharge of our
</p>
<p>duties. We feel that our exertions will be of ho avail
</p>
<p>withoutthe aidofgovernment,andinthis emergency all
</p>
<p>our exertions will be rendered nugatory and abortive.
</p>
<p>The only remark that shall beoffered on the commis-

<p>questing to know why he is dismissed, and petition-

</p>
<p>To the Chief Secretary of Government.
</p>
<p>Sir,
</p>
<p>I have received your letter of the Sth instant with the
</p>
<p>utmost surprise and concern, as it conveyed to me the
</p>
<p>first intimation of having incurred the displeasure of
</p>
<p>the honourable the president in council. My removal
</p>
<p>from the two important offices of paymaster-general
</p>
<p>and mint-master, the former of which I have held for
</p>
<p>so many years, and the latter department I have esta-
</p>
<p>blished, and in discharging the duties of which, I can
</p>
<p>conscientiously say I have exerted myself with unre-
</p>
<p>mitting zeal to promote the interests of my honourable
</p>
<p>employers, is so severe a punishment, so public a mark
</p>
<p>of the disapprobation of government, and so painful
</p>
<p>a degradation in the eyes of the public, that, as I am
</p>
<p>conscious of no breach of public duty, I can only im-
</p>
<p>pute this heavy misfortune to some extraordinary^and
</p>
<p>unfounded misrepresentation, or from the malevolence
</p>
<p>of my enemies. In this peculiarly distressing situation
</p>
<p>I rely with confidence on the justice of government,
</p>
<p>that an opportunity will be afforded me of explaining
</p>
<p>or defending my conduct ; that I shall not be punished
</p>
<p>unheard ; and that a privilege, founded on the im-
</p>
<p>mutable principles of justice, and repeatedly recog-
</p>
<p>nised in the orders of the honourable the court of di-
</p>
<p>rectors, will not, in this instance, be withheld from
</p>

<p>Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>We take the chance of this letter overtaking the

</p>
<p>at this place since our last. We shall not make any
</p>
<p>remarks upon them, but leave you to draw your own

</p>
<p>Mr. W. Hawkins, Mr. W. Oliver, and Mr. G. Keene,
</p>
<p>who served upon the petit jury that tried tiiese de-
</p>
<p>fendants, have all been ordered away from Madras,
</p>
<p>and appointed to different stations distant from the
</p>
<p>presidency. Mr. E. Wood, and some others, who
</p>
<p>tiave had the manly courage to express their sentiments
</p>
<p>regarding the late proceedings, have .also been re-
</p>
<p>moved.
</p>
<p>We omitted to notice to you, in our last, that we
</p>
<p>had written to the Lord Chancellor a particular ac-
</p>
<p>count of these trials, and of the measures of the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice regarding them. A term commenced upon the
</p>
<p>21st instant; and we are preparing an affidavit, and a
</p>
<p>petition of appeal from the decisions of the Chief Jus-
</p>
<p>tice to the King.in council. We beg leave to call your
</p>
<p>attention to these proceedings, and to recommend to
</p>
<p>you to take such steps in support of them, as may be in
</p>
<p>your power. Independent of the interest which every
</p>
<p>member of civilised society ought to have in the due
</p>
<p>execution ,<?f public justice, the fair creditors of the
</p>
<p>Nabo b .are particularly interested in seeing the law
</p>
<p>carried into effect against the defendants, Batley and
</p>
<p>Reddy Row. They are the sole hope and support of
</p>
<p>the forgers, and of those who claim upon forged
</p>
<p>bonds. Had they been only committed until the
</p>
<p>pleasure of his majesty should be known upon their
</p>
<p>cases, the whole band of forgers would have disap-
</p>
<p>peared. We know that they were prepared to quit
</p>
<p>Madras had the verdicts been followed up with judg-
</p>
<p>ment A it is, we feel confident we have done great
</p>
<p>service to the bona fide creditors. The week before
</p>
<p>last twelve or thirteen claims, amounting to more than
</p>
<p>..700,000, were advertised for investigation : the
</p>
<p>bonds upon which the claims were made were cer-

<p>tainly very barefaced forgeries, and Reddy Row had
</p>
<p>no connection with them ; and it was on this account,
</p>
<p>perhaps, that they were selected by the commissioners,
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>Uiat they might have the credit of rejecting the claims,
</p>
<p>of doisg something. .Not a single
</p>
<p>ch.ima -M appeared to support his claim.
</p>
<p>In our letter of the 8th instant to the governor-ge-
</p>
<p>neral, you \vi!l see an allusion to the famous Mana'r-
</p>
<p>:. ly mission. In speaking of the acts of govern-
</p>
<p>ment in this country you are aware that we are obliged
</p>
<p>to be very cautious, but in truth we did not know at
</p>
<p>that tiine that the instructions to Mr. Saunders went
</p>
<p>so far, at least avowedly, as to direct him to collect
</p>
<p>witnesses for the trial. In October last, prior to the
</p>
<p>first trial, the law officers of government applied to
</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenshaw the collector of Arcot, through the
</p>
<p>board of revenue, upon the same subject. Mr. Ravdn-
</p>
<p>shaw made enquiries, and found that Anunda Row
</p>
<p>had, in fact, resided in the districts at the time stated
</p>
<p>upon the part of the prosecution, and reported the
</p>
<p>same accordingly. There is not in the whole service
</p>
<p>a more upright, honourable man than Mr. Ravenshaw;
</p>
<p>he is totally unconnected with the nabob's creditors,
</p>
<p>and, we have since heard from himself, did not know,
</p>
<p>at the time he was directed to make the enquiry, what
</p>
<p>was the motive of it. His report not being favorable
</p>
<p>to the defence, was suppressed by the law officers, but
</p>
<p>"we got intelligence of it, and the counsel for the prose-
</p>
<p>cution related the whole transaction in court, and chal-
</p>
<p>lenged the counsel for the defence to produce Mr.
</p>
<p>Ravenshaw's letter, which he of course declined. It
</p>
<p>was in consequence of this that the law officers of
</p>
<p>government employed one who was a perfect stranger
</p>
<p>in tlie districts, in preference to one, who from his situ-
</p>
<p>ation must naturally have been more competent to ob.
</p>
<p>tain information upon the subject. The Amildar, wild'
</p>

</p>
<p>Extract of Sir Benjamin Sullivan's Argument.
</p>
<p>In regard to the third part of the question, namely,
</p>
<p>how the forged bond ought to be disposed of? it was
</p>
<p>moved the other day, and perhaps irregularly, ;s the
</p>
<p>proceedings have not been removed, that it siiould
</p>
<p>be lodged with the officers of the court, the bon(< ^e-
</p>
<p>ing then, and I suppose still is, in the hands <
</p>
<p>commissioners for investigating the Carnatic d<
</p>
<p>The opinion of my lord chief justice, if I understand
</p>
<p>him correctly, was that it rested with those gentic-
</p>
<p>men to deposit the bond in court or not as t'r y
</p>
<p>should think proper. He said it could riot be iti
</p>
<p>safer hands than with the officers of the court, but
</p>
<p>that they were to use their discretion in the matter,
</p>
<p>that he would not order it. His lordship said he con-
</p>
<p>sidered the bond, although tainted, to be still an out-
</p>
<p>standing claim ; and that notwithstanding the verdict,
</p>
<p>which pronounced it to be a forgery, he thought the
</p>
<p>commissioners were competent to exercise their judg-
</p>
<p>ment upon it, and to recommend it as a good and
</p>
<p>valid bond, if they thought proper so to do, but. that

</p>
<p>it would be a dereliction of duty if they suffered the
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>yerdict to influence their judgment in the investigation
</p>
<p>of that claim.
</p>
<p>This, I think, was the substance of what fell from
</p>
<p>his lordship ; if I have in any tiling misconceived
</p>
<p>his meaning, I shall be thankful to him to set me
</p>
<p>right these sentiments fell from him in the warmth
</p>
<p>of argument, and I should be extremely sorry to im-
</p>
<p>pute them to him, unless, on reflection, he should
</p>
<p>think proper to avow them. But I must withhold
</p>
<p>my assent, as they stand at present, and should deem-
</p>
<p>myself unworthy of the place I occupy on this bench,
</p>
<p>did I not express my warmest dissent to sentiments
</p>
<p>openly delivered, which.if adhered to,seern to me to be
</p>
<p>fraught with public inconvenience.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to say what may be the result of
</p>
<p>the reference to his majesty ; he may refuse to grant
</p>
<p>a pardon altogether ; and it is most likely he will, as
</p>
<p>I believe he has never yet been known to pardon the
</p>
<p>crime of forgery, and in that event judgment must
</p>
<p>not only be pronounced, but the bond cancelled, (2
</p>
<p>Inst. 60.) for all prosecutions of forgery have two
</p>
<p>objects in view, to defeat the criminal intention of
</p>
<p>the offender, where that intention has not already
</p>
<p>been carried into effect, and to punish him for the
</p>
<p>means he employed to effect it -to inflict the punish-
</p>
<p>ment, and yet leave it in his power to effect his cri-
</p>
<p>minal intention, would be absurd ; and therefore, ia
</p>
<p>eases of forgery, the court commonly takes care, by
</p>
<p>cancelling the forged paper, or delivering it up to the'
</p>
<p>prosecutor for that purpose* that an improper use'
</p>
<p>shall not be made of it; should then a refusal of par-^
</p>
<p>don be the reference to the crown, where shall we
</p>
<p>look for the forged bond if it be suffered to remain-
</p>
<p>with tlie commissioners, for these gentlemen act-

</p>
<p>under instructions from the commissioners in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, by whom they are directed to transmit to them,
</p>
<p>all bonds upon which any claim is founded ? Should
</p>
<p>his majesty therefore be advised to adhere to his ro-
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>solution not to pardon forgery, and orders come out
</p>
<p>to us to proceed to judgment, are we to send to
</p>
<p>England for the bond ? The court ought not
</p>
<p>surely to expose itself to this inconvenience, nor to
</p>
<p>the far greater perhaps of rendering future judgment
</p>
<p>wholly ineffectual, by seeing this bond acknowledged'
</p>
<p>by the commissioners as a judicium, and put in a
</p>
<p>tram of payment a bond which, after a full defence,
</p>
<p>has been pronounced by a British Jury to be a for-
</p>
<p>gery ; and the evidence brought in support of it has
</p>
<p>been, by another jury, pronounced to be wilful and
</p>
<p>corrupt perjury. Siiouid the commissioners be en-
</p>
<p>couraged to venture so far as this should they be led
</p>
<p>to hold the verdicts of two grand juries, and two petit
</p>
<p>juries in such disregard as to declare this bond an
</p>
<p>honest and fair claim, shall we be justified in the
</p>
<p>eyes of our Sovereign and our country in assisting to
</p>
<p>lead them into error, by leaving it in their power so
</p>
<p>to do ? It is our duty, I think, to guard against the
</p>
<p>possibility of such a conduct: it is also our duty to
</p>
<p>await the result of the reference to his majesty, and to
</p>
<p>have every thing in readiness to obey the royal orders
</p>
<p>as soon as we receive them : should the king be pleas-
</p>
<p>ed so far to extend his mercy to the offenders as to
</p>
<p>grant them a conditional pardon, and the condition be
</p>
<p>that the forged bond shall be cancelled, how shall we
</p>
<p>carry his orders into execution if the Bond is not within
</p>
<p>our reach if it is not in our actual custody and
</p>
<p>power? Why the officer of the court was permitted
</p>
<p>to return it to them I know not, but by suffering it
</p>
<p>to remain in the hands of the commissioners, we
</p>
<p>place ourselves in the situation of not being able
</p>
<p>to conform to the orders he may think proper to
</p>
<p>send to us; and why draw this incon enience on our-

</p>
<p>selves, when we have it in our power to avoid it, by
</p>
<p>directing that the bond be lodged with the officer of
</p>
<p>the court?
</p>
<p>At the same time that we draw a great inconveni-
</p>
<p>ence on ourselves, by suffering the bond to remain
</p>
<p>in their hands, we expose them to solicitations and
</p>
<p>importunities to pass it as a fair demand, which, in my
</p>
<p>opinion, ought to be avoided, for these gentlemen are
</p>
<p>hot placed above the Law; their powers of decision
</p>
<p>arise solely from the deeds between the company and
</p>
<p>the creditors, which are neither ratified nor confirmed,
</p>
<p>by parliament, as is evident from the ninth clause of
</p>
<p>the act; they are liable, like all other trustees to suits,
</p>
<p>for abuse of trust, and should not I think be unneces-
</p>
<p>sarily exposed to it ; nor to the serious inconveni-
</p>
<p>ence of admitting in the list of claims, which they are.
</p>
<p>bound, through the commissioners in England, to lay
</p>
<p>before the two houses of parliament at every sessions,
</p>
<p>with the grounds of their decision, that they passed
</p>
<p>this bond, or recommended it to be passed, indirect
</p>
<p>cfpposition to the verdict of a British jury. For
</p>
<p>these reasons I am clearly and strongly of opinion
</p>
<p>that an order should be made for depositing the bond
</p>
<p>with the officer of the court. I shall close what I
</p>
<p>have to say on this question, by observing, that though
</p>
<p>a creditor of the late nabob, I am not at present, in the
</p>
<p>smallest degree, interested in this bond. The verdict
</p>
<p>of a British jury having pronounced it to be a forgery,
</p>
<p>even the semblance of validity is for ever gone, and
</p>
<p>by its validity only could my interests be affected.
</p>
<p>Though the verdict has not had the aid of judgment,
</p>
<p>its propriety has not been questioned by the defend-
</p>
<p>ants themselves, and, by not praying a new trial, which
</p>
<p>might have been granted, they have acknowledged
</p>
<p>its justice. The punishment due to the crime. of
</p>
<p>forgery may, perhaps, be pardoned, but no pardon
</p>
<p>can stamp a value on the bond ; that will for ever
</p>
<p>remain attainted, and, I may venture to say, an useless-
</p>
<p>paper; for the commissioners in England, with whom
</p>
<p>the final decision rests on all the Carnatic claims, will

</p>
<p>unquestionably hold the trial by jury, that great pal-
</p>
<p>ladium of our liberties, in too much veneration to
</p>
<p>allow the opinions of any individuals here to be put
</p>
<p>in competition with the verdict of twelve men upon
</p>
<p>their oaths; nor would it, I apprehend, be suffered by
</p>
<p>95
</p>
<p>parliament, to whom they undoubtedly are account-
</p>
<p>able. The quotation from my letter will therefore, I
</p>
<p>trust, miss its evident aim to cast on my opinion, if
</p>
<p>I should venture to give one, the imputation of
</p>
<p>interest. Bui, T am too well known in this settlement
</p>
<p>to have my integrity brought in question. I am not
</p>
<p>now interested in the fate of this bond, nor was I from
</p>
<p>the moment the justice of the verdict was acknow-
</p>
<p>ledged, by neither moving for a new trial, nor in arrest
</p>
<p>of judgment. I am neither interested in it myself,
</p>
<p>nor is any one connected with me.
</p>
<p>THIRD QUESTION.
</p>
<p>As to the question, whether the prayer of Mr. Marsh
</p>
<p>for an order from this court to print the late trials,
</p>
<p>.ought to be granted or not :
</p>
<p>I think that as the trials are not before the court,
</p>
<p>but before the court of oyer and terminer and gaol
</p>
<p>delivery, the application would more properly be made
</p>
<p>to that court but perhaps, as this is riot a question
</p>
<p>of law, and my lord chief justice, befpre whom the
</p>
<p>men were tried, presides here, we may, placing a per-
</p>
<p>fect confidence in Mr. Marsh's ability and correctness
</p>
<p>give him leave to print them ; but what end will our
</p>
<p>permission answer, if there exists any where within
</p>
<p>the settelment, a power to controul the liberty of the
</p>
<p>press ? He has already applied to the chief secretary
</p>
<p>of government for leave to publish them, and has re-
</p>
<p>ceived for answer that it is not thought expedient
</p>
<p>and nothing more, no reason given why it should not
</p>
<p>be printed but it sometimes is not convenient to as-
</p>
<p>sign reasons. The chief secretary could not have said
</p>
<p>that the government of this settlement have power to
</p>
<p>revive the act of Charles II. for restraining the liberty
</p>
<p>jpf the press. The act, after two revivals, expired ahout

</p>
<p>one hundred years ago, and all the efforts 01 King Wil-
</p>
<p>Jiam, that great favourite of the nation/vverenotsuincient
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>to prevail on parliament to revive it again. Parliament
</p>
<p>knew too well the value of a free press to put it under
</p>
<p>any other restriction, than that already imposed on it
</p>
<p>by the law of libels. The chief secretary might perhaps
</p>
<p>have said that government had been for many years
</p>
<p>in the exercise of a power to restrain the press ; by
</p>
<p>prohibiting the publication of any thing that may
</p>
<p>create private uneasiness, or public ferment; and that
</p>
<p>the settlement had so long acquiesced in the assump^
</p>
<p>tion of this power, that it had grown into a right,
</p>
<p>which they now thought proper to exercise, allowing
</p>
<p>for a moment that the acquiescence of the settlement
</p>
<p>for twenty or twenty-five years past (for beyond that
</p>
<p>period, there was no press at Madras) could con-,
</p>
<p>lersuch a right. It was limited to the newspapers,
</p>
<p>and never extended nor meant to be extended, to
</p>
<p>the length to which it would now be carried, In the
</p>
<p>case of the king against Paupiah and others, many
</p>
<p>years ago, for a conspiracy against Mr, David Hali-
</p>
<p>bruton, no such right was pretended to, that trial was
</p>
<p>printed and published at Madras, and no objection
</p>
<p>whatsoever made to it on the part of government,
</p>
<p>even though the governor and council were then
</p>
<p>judges of oyer and terminer, and formed the court
</p>
<p>before whom the defendants were tried ; they were
</p>
<p>not lawyers, and were therefore liable to errors in
</p>
<p>judgment, which they might not have wished to have
</p>
<p>Exposed to the observation of the public, but no ob-
</p>
<p>jection whatever was made. The other day at Cal-
</p>
<p>cutta, the trial of Mr. Tucker for an assault on
</p>
<p>a married lady, with intent to commit a rape,
</p>
<p>was printed and published at Bombay ; all the trials
</p>
<p>of consequence are printed in the public papers, many
</p>
<p>have appeared in the public papers of Bengal, and

</p>
<p>come have lately appeared in our own way, why then
</p>
<p>object to a publication of the late trial ? are the cha-
</p>
<p>racters and conduct of the men tried, like a lady's
</p>
<p>fame, too sacred to be mentioned, or are the public
</p>
<p>less interested in being acquainted with the circum-
</p>
<p>stances which came out on their trials, than they

<p>97
</p>
<p>were in those which have at various times already
</p>
<p>appeared? Nothing of this kind could possibly be
</p>
<p>the cause of refusing to let those trials be made pub-

<p>" stone informs us, 4 Com. 134) against public jus-
</p>
<p>" tice, as it keeps alive strife and contention, and
</p>
<p>" perverts the remedial process of the law into an
</p>
<p>" engine of oppression, and therefore, by the Roman
</p>
<p>" law, it was a species of the crimen falsi to enter
</p>
<p>" into any confederacy, or to do any act to support
</p>
<p>" another's law suit by money, witness, or patronage."
</p>
<p>The excellent lawyer and upright judge, who quitted,
</p>
<p>iss last October, noticed a similar imprudence in the
</p>
<p>case of Abbot v. Hussam ul Mulk, and pronounced it
</p>
<p>from the Bench to be maintenance.
</p>
<p>If then the secret reason of thinking it inexpedient to
</p>
<p>permit the publication of these trials, was to pre-
</p>
<p>vent the exposure of their falling a second time into
</p>
<p>the same error, it wa* certainly prudent; but more
</p>
<p>prudence would have been shewn if they would have
</p>
<p>taken the blunt hint of Sir Henry Gwillirn, and avoid-
</p>
<p>ed the error altogether. I was lor three and twenty
</p>
<p>years a confidential servant of the company under
</p>
<p>this government, and feel an habitual leaning to-
</p>
<p>wards them; I am not, therefore, inclined to impute
</p>
<p>any thing to them but imprudence, but imprudent,
</p>
<p>I am afraid, they have been, in taking any part in a
</p>
<p>cause which seemed to call on them for a steady and
</p>
<p>fii-tf rmined neutrality ; and had I still been their at-
</p>
<p>torney general, this is the conduct I should have ad-
</p>
<p>vised; all this however may soon be overlooked and

<p>forgotten, if the error be not further repeated. But
</p>
<p>the unauthorized restriction of the press cannot be so
</p>
<p>easily passed over; it is the dearest privilege to a
</p>
<p>British subject; the best and surest protection of his
</p>
<p>liberties; the greatest check on the extension of au-
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>98
</p>
<p>thority, to which w.e are all naturally inclined; it is
</p>
<p>the best security we hive for the pure administra-
</p>
<p>tion of the laws we live under, and for keeping unpol-
</p>
<p>luted by undue influence, or arbitrary decision the sa-
</p>
<p>cred seats of justice. Mr. Marsh, has therefore my
</p>
<p>leave, as far as it can avail him, to publish these trials.
</p>
<p>But my leave is comparatively of little value. By the
</p>
<p>constitution of the court, my lord chief justice at pre-
</p>
<p>sent possesses a double or casting voice ; whether,
</p>
<p>therefore, Mr. Marsh shall, or shall not have the leave
</p>
<p>of the court, depends on the inclination of his
</p>
<p>lordship's mind.
</p>
<p>THE END.
