</p>
<p>Enter Frank, Mark, Ernebt, Angelo, Julian, and other Students,
</p>
<p>Ernest. This is the spot. We'll wait here, till he come.
</p>
<p>Frank. There is old Plato. Bless his good old soul.
</p>
<p>He has a heart to match his grand old head.
</p>
<p>I doubt if ever towered a nobler brow
</p>
<p>On Grecian statue. All heads bare. Hats off.

</p>
<p>That in such brave array doth call you forth.
</p>
<p>2 THE CONSPIRACY. [Act L
</p>
<p>Frank. On deeds of high emnrise are we intent*.
</p>
<p>Know st thou of some fierce monster, to be slain,
</p>
<p>Or beauteous damsel, wandering all forlorn,
</p>
<p>In forest lost, or lonely captive kept,
</p>
<p>In lofty tower, or dark, deep horrid cave,
</p>
<p>By giant grim, or bloody baron bold ?
</p>
<p>Oh ! speak ! that to the rescue we may rush.
</p>
<p>Dr. John. Monsters enow  of vice and wrong  -
</p>
<p>there are,
</p>
<p>And doubtless damsels in distress who sigh,
</p>
<p>For valorous knights to rush to their relief.
</p>
<p>But bearded champions they do prefer.
</p>
<p>Wait, my dear sirs ! till ye are out of school,
</p>
<p>And have your beards ere ye adventure forth
</p>
<p>On such achievements and essay to play,
</p>
<p>The gentle knight a pricking on the plain.
</p>
<p>But, speak, sirs ! tell me, wherefore are ye here ?
</p>
<p>Frank. I will expound. You know, that by the courses"
</p>
<p>Of antique custom, here by men renowned
</p>
<p>Ordained of old
</p>
<p>Music heard'
</p>
<p>Students. Hark ! Hush ! There's music here.
</p>
<p>Frnest. 'Tis floating in the air. Whence can it come ?
</p>
<p>Angelo. How sweet and spirit like it is !
</p>
<p>Dr. John. It breathes
</p>
<p>A strange, unearthly sweetness. It must be,
</p>
<p>That in the air some gentle Ariel
</p>
<p>Is hovering orer us.
</p>
<p>Frank. More like, 'tis Puck,,
</p>
<p>The merry fay. He's stole iEolus' lyre,
</p>
<p>From off the pine upon the mountain top,
</p>
<p>To practice on it airs of fairy land.
</p>
<p>He seeks to lure us off to some lone place,
</p>
<p>Some deep dark dell, or secret strange recess,

<p>Amidst the forest, where the fairies haunt,
</p>
<p>And where bewildered in the tangled wilds
</p>
<p>We'll be within his power, for him, the imp,
</p>
<p>To play his pranks and knavish tricks upon.
</p>
<p>Mark. Hist ! Hist ! The music dies away ! 'Tis gone I
</p>
<p>Dr. John. Now, speak, sir ! Tell me wherefore are
</p>
<p>ye here ?
</p>
<p>Scene I. THE CONSPIRACY. 3
</p>
<p>Frank. I will explain. You know that by the course
</p>
<p>Of custom immemorial, in this
</p>
<p>Most ancient seat of learning and of wit,
</p>
<p>"We students, here, to-morrow, publicly,
</p>
<p>Must be, in scholarship and eloquence,
</p>
<p>Examined by the learned men of the realm.
</p>
<p>For genius and for learning, prizes rare,
</p>
<p>Medals and marks of honor are in store ;
</p>
<p>And he, who first in merit shall be found
</p>
<p>Will be the heir unto a crown, a wreath,
</p>
<p>'That on his brow should by the King be placed 
</p>
<p>E'en by the sacred hand of majesty.
</p>
<p>But to the wars away the King has gone ;
</p>
<p>And none is there to do this duty now,
</p>
<p>But she, the lovely Princess, his fair child,
</p>
<p>Whom in his place, he's left to rule the realm
</p>
<p>As his imperial prototype, the sun,
</p>
<p>When he doth visit the antipodes,
</p>
<p>Doth by the moon, sweet regent of the night,
</p>
<p>In gentle reflex of his mightier beam,
</p>
<p>Still unto us dispense his Jblessed light.
</p>
<p>Hence has our royal eomrade, the good Prince,
</p>
<p>The cousin of the Princess, gone to learn
</p>
<p>From her, if she will take her father's place
</p>
<p>And grace to-morrow's victor with his crown.
</p>
<p>Oh ! doubly precious will the glory he
</p>
<p>From her fair hand 1 The Prince will soon be here
</p>
<p>And we have come to meet him and to learn,
</p>
<p>As soon as it may be, the word he brings.
</p>
<p>Lo ! yonder eom.es he. Mercury ne'er sped,
</p>
<p>Swift messenger of Heaven, with word from Jove,
</p>
<p>To those who watched for him more eagerly.
</p>
<p>live Music heard again.
</p>
<p>Angelo. The music comes again. Hark ! how it swells

<p>As from afar 'twere wafted down to us.
</p>
<p>Hist ! Now it dies away, as up again
</p>
<p>'Twere borne on viewless wings to airy heights.
</p>
<p>It comes again ! 'Tis here !
</p>
<p>Mark. 'Tis here !
</p>
<p>Frank. 'Tis in the breeze !
</p>
<p>Angelo. There is some tricky spirit round, that seeks
</p>
<p>4 THE CONSPIRACY, [Act I.
</p>
<p>With this sweet mockery to sport with us.
</p>
<p>Dr. John. There runs a thread of sadness through
</p>
<p>the strain.
</p>
<p>Methinks the harps of Judah hung upon
</p>
<p>The willows by the streams of Babylon,
</p>
<p>Though mute to Zion's songs, may to the winds,
</p>
<p>That swept their chords, have breathed just such sweet
</p>
<p>tones.
</p>
<p>Frank. 'Tis some melodious zephyr in the trees.
</p>
<p>Perchance some fancy-striken youth has strung
</p>
<p>Among these leaves a lyre iEolian,
</p>
<p>For the airy fingers to perform upon,
</p>
<p>And these sweet airs, that thus salute our ears,
</p>
<p>Are but the touches of the airs of Heaven.
</p>
<p>Enter the Prince.
</p>
<p>Students. Hail to the Prince ! Peace ! Silence !
</p>
<p>Let us hear.
</p>
<p>Prince. Rejoice, comrades ! Glorious the news I bring.
</p>
<p>The Princess graciously doth grant our prayer.
</p>
<p>To-morrow she will come with all her court
</p>
<p>Of Lords and ladies fair and learned men,
</p>
<p>To test our scholarship and eloquence.
</p>
<p>In the evening, at the palace, she will give
</p>
<p>In honor of our class, a festival ;
</p>
<p>A royal one, whereto we all will go
</p>
<p>And taste of earth's selectest revelry.
</p>
<p>Frank. Heaven bless our lovely Princess.
</p>
<p>Mark. As she's good
</p>
<p>And beautiful, may she be ever blest.
</p>
<p>Angela. We'll see what Homer in his raptures saw,
</p>
<p>When Venus, in her beauty walked before
</p>
<p>Him on Olympus.
</p>
<p>Frank. There'll be a Hebe there,
</p>
<p>Whom I shall see, with nectar  on her lips,

</p>
<p>Sweeter than Jove e'er sipped.
</p>
<p>Dr. John. And doubtless all
</p>
<p>The Graces will be there and troops of nymphs.
</p>
<p>Invite a poet and the counterparts
</p>
<p>He'll find to all the gods and goddesses.
</p>
<p>Give it a Homer, and each age would be
</p>
<p>Heroic, every mountain an Olympus.
</p>
<p>Scene I.] THE CONSPIRACY. 5
</p>
<p>Angelo. Heaven from its brightest constellations shed
</p>
<p>On our sweet Princess happiest influence.
</p>
<p>The Music heard.
</p>
<p>Prince. What music 's this, that breathes so sweetly
</p>
<p>here-?
</p>
<p>Frank. 'Tis some enchantment, that doth haunt the
</p>
<p>place.
</p>
<p>Prince. It softly swells, then dies upon the breeze,
</p>
<p>Rising and falling with each airy wave.
</p>
<p>It seems as from above afar it came.
</p>
<p>Frank. The voice of harpers harping with their harps,
</p>
<p>I'll bet the pearly gates are now ajar
</p>
<p>And these sweet notes have thence escaped ; or else
</p>
<p>It is some genial spirit stolen forth
</p>
<p>To have a laugh at us, some syren of
</p>
<p>The golden harps come down to puzzle us
</p>
<p>And to allure us with these hints of Heaven.
</p>
<p>Prince. It is a strange peculiar melody.
</p>
<p>But comrades ! where is Paul, our gentle friend ?
</p>
<p>'Tis strange that he's not here.
</p>
<p>Ernest. We've seen him not.
</p>
<p>Julian. As you do say 'tis strange that he's not here,
</p>
<p>'Tis said, that he aspires unto the crown.
</p>
<p>Perhaps his courage fails him and he yields
</p>
<p>The prize to bolder aspirants  else sure
</p>
<p>He would be here.
</p>
<p>Prince. I'll go and seek for^him.
</p>
<p>I've news, that will be music in his ears.
</p>
<p>Frank. Hold ! there's that strain again. 'Tis
</p>
<p>coming here.
</p>
<p>Prince. It louder is, as if it nearer came.
</p>
<p>Mark. Huzza ! see there ! see there ! What tree
</p>
<p>is this,
</p>
<p>That bears such fruit as that ?

<p>Paul discovered in the Tree.
</p>
<p>Frank. Ha ! ha ! Strange fruit indeed !
</p>
<p>Some species new. Special spontaneous
</p>
<p>Developement! Most like, on some such tree
</p>
<p>Sprang forth that old primeval ape, that was
</p>
<p>Our great ancestor. Darwin ! Science that I

</p>
<p>Or else ; I have it now  a theory
</p>
<p>Historical and theological,
</p>
<p>And exegetical and pomological,
</p>
<p>I do suspect, that 'tis the kind of fruit,
</p>
<p>With which the serpent tempted mother Eve
</p>
<p>In Paradise.
</p>
<p>Mark. And ail the mothers since.
</p>
<p>Paul comes down from tlie Tree.
</p>
<p>Ernest. By all the powers and spirits it is Paul.
</p>
<p>Julian. By all the fiends and devils it is he.
</p>
<p>Prince. Art thou this spirit that's been mocking us
</p>
<p>With this mysterious music so weirdlike ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Stick pins in him and see if 'tis real flesh
</p>
<p>Or only some thin immaterial stuff.
</p>
<p>Were any of Eve's daughters here, Ave'd let
</p>
<p>Her take a bite and see what fruit it is.
</p>
<p>Julian (aside.) It is my dagger that I'd stick in him.
</p>
<p>He is the only rival that I fear.
</p>
<p>Were he out of the way, the crown were mine
</p>
<p>With all the honors, that will come with it.
</p>
<p>Paul. Good friends 'twas but a jest  I Avill explain.
</p>
<p>I had come out alone into this grove,
</p>
<p>And here was sitting on this grassy bank,
</p>
<p>Listening unto the music floating round.
</p>
<p>And ever now and then upon my lute
</p>
<p>I'd catch such notes from breeze, and brook and bird,
</p>
<p>As struck my fancy. Thus it was I made
</p>
<p>The little melody which you did hear.
</p>
<p>Just then I saw you coming and I thought
</p>
<p>I'd try my music on you. So I hid
</p>
<p>In these thick branches, and as you came near,
</p>
<p>I threw out on the breeze the notes you heard ;
</p>
<p>It was their wild and fitful character,
</p>
<p>Caught from the zephyr, that perplexed you so

</p>
<p>And puzzled you to know, whence came
</p>
<p>The mystic and uncertain harmony.
</p>
<p>The jest succeeded better than I thought.
</p>
<p>Prince. 'Twas a most delicately merry jest ;
</p>
<p>'Tis clear the zephyr did conspire with you
</p>
<p>And instigate the mischief. But come friends,
</p>
<p>We now must hasten back unto our work.
</p>
<p>Scene I.] THE CONSPIRACY. X
</p>
<p>Think, what the morrow has for us to do !
</p>
<p>Frank. Of the bright eyes that on us then will beam.
</p>
<p>Mark. And the sweet smiles that with those beams
</p>
<p>will blend.
</p>
<p>Ernest. And of the honors that we there shall win.
</p>
<p>Julian. And of the crown that one of us will wear.
</p>
<p>Prince. And the fair hand that will bestow that crownv
</p>
<p>Paul. And of the honor of these ancient halls
</p>
<p>Of learning, whose proud fame we must sustain.
</p>
<p>Prince. We'll make these groves and shades of ours
</p>
<p>renowned,
</p>
<p>As were of old the walks of Academe.
</p>
<p>Frank. We'll leave our foot prints on the sands of
</p>
<p>time,
</p>
<p>That when we have departed, seeing them
</p>
<p>The world will say of us, " They walked with Plato."
</p>
<p>(bowing to Dr. John.)
</p>
<p>Or, " Here (to Julian) was a Demosthenes," or " lo 1
</p>
<p>Here, (to Angelo) is a step Parnassian, on the heights
</p>
<p>Where Homer stood," " Their (to Paul and the Prince)
</p>
<p>noble deeds
</p>
<p>In lustre and true glory well might be,
</p>
<p>Sisters unto those daughters, pure as fair,
</p>
<p>Epaminondas left unto his country."
</p>
<p>Dr. John. Go on, Sir ! Socrates, Isocrates,
</p>
<p>Xenocrates, Solon, Crates,
</p>
<p>Aristides and Aristoteles,
</p>
<p>Thucydides and Sophocles,
</p>
<p>Praxiteles and Pericles, and scores
</p>
<p>Of starry ones ye well might name for bright
</p>
<p>Comparison, for in her annals grand
</p>
<p>Old Greece has specimens of every kind
</p>
<p>Of glory.
</p>
<p>Prince. Come away ! To toil let's give the day.

<p>That we our parts to-morrow well may play.
</p>
<p>Exeunt,
</p>
<p>Act I ] THE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Scehe 2d. A Walk in ths University Grounds.
</p>
<p>Enter Frank, Ernest and Mark.
</p>
<p>Frank. Wise as the serpent, harmless as the dove !
</p>
<p>That means, we should use policy ;  should have
</p>
<p>The spirit of the dove, its soul of love
</p>
<p>And gentleness ; but with it should unite
</p>
<p>The serpent's sharper qualities,-  its tact.
</p>
<p>Its keen-eyed, still, adroit and lowly art,
</p>
<p>Its pliancy to bend to obstacles
</p>
<p>And wind around them to its purposes.
</p>
<p>Our aims should e'er be noble, to do good,
</p>
<p>To make men happy and earth beautiful ;
</p>
<p>But then to do all this,  to realize
</p>
<p>These aims and work out these results of good
</p>
<p>And beauty,  we must wisdom have, prudence
</p>
<p>And policy ; or as the text doth bid,
</p>
<p>The serpent with the dove we must combine.
</p>
<p>To do things wisely, well, effectually,
</p>
<p>Is just as much a duty, as it is
</p>
<p>To do at all. To go to Rome, we need
</p>
<p>Not strike a bee-line, dig the Alps, or scale
</p>
<p>The rocks and glaciers. Rather we should shun
</p>
<p>The perilous and craggy peaks and seek
</p>

<p>Before us for our country,  to achieve
</p>
<p>Its liberty. A noble aim, is't not ?
</p>
<p>Ernest. In every age the special work of heroes.
</p>
<p>Frank. To attempt it openly, were but to dash
</p>
<p>Madly against the glaciers and the rocks
</p>
<p>Scene II.] THE CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>And wake the avalanche, to fight with it.
</p>
<p>Hence from the serpent we must take our cue ;
</p>
<p>Through thy dark winding ways, Oh ! thou wise snake,
</p>
<p>Cunning Conspiracy ! creep stealthily,
</p>
<p>But not less nobly onward to our end.
</p>
<p>Mark. Aye, policy and stern necessity
</p>
<p>Both point it out, as our true only course.
</p>
<p>Ernest. I like it not. But it must needs be so.
</p>
<p>Yes, anything and everything for country !
</p>
<p>Yet, I do like it not. I'd rather give
</p>
<p>Our banner to the winds and boldly march,
</p>
<p>With shout and trumpet blast and cannon peal,
</p>
<p>To victory or death. I like it not.
</p>
<p>But anything I'll do, and everything
</p>
<p>I'll dare, to win sweet liberty,
</p>
<p>And make our dear, beloved country free.
</p>
<p>Franl. It is the motive, that gives character
</p>
<p>Unto the act. A noble end
</p>
<p>Ennobles every step, that leads to it.
</p>
<p>In climbing mountains, we do bend and stoop,
</p>
<p>And on the craggy steeps and slippery ways,
</p>
<p>Oft on our knees creep up to glorious heights.
</p>
<p>I have now in my mind a character,
</p>
<p>One of the noblest spirits of the times,
</p>
<p>Whose life has been one long conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Hated and hunted of the tyrants, he
</p>
<p>With plots and wiles has met and baffled them ;
</p>
<p>His genius, zeal and purpose pure and high,
</p>
<p>Mightier than were an army in the field.
</p>
<p>In prison, exile, pain and poverty,
</p>
<p>Yet has he been a power in the world,
</p>
<p>A menace and a terror unto tyranny.
</p>
<p>With pure, unselfish and untiring zeal,
</p>
<p>He's toiled on, ever to his country true,

<p>And to his great idea of liberty,
</p>
<p>Alike the truest hero of the age,
</p>
<p>And most inveterate conspirator.
</p>
<p>Mark. Aye, Italy, in all its long bright list,
</p>
<p>Has not a name of purer lustre.
</p>
<p>Ernest. Tell me, how now do stand the citizens ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Eager for insurrection. Just ablaze.
</p>
<p>The city's like a kindling fire ; a breath
</p>

<p>Once blown, the flame of revolution forth

</p>
<p>Ernest. Has Paul yet given his assent ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Not yet ;
</p>
<p>But he'll be with us. We must have his name.
</p>
<p>'Twere worth to us more than an armed troop.
</p>
<p>By sweet attractive love and kindliness,
</p>
<p>E'en as a sun 'mong men, he wins their hearts;
</p>
<p>And good men circle round him planet-like,
</p>
<p>And cluster in bright constellation. Thus
</p>
<p>Doth earth present its counterpart to Heaven ;
</p>
<p>Its asterisms of the good and wise,
</p>
<p>High starry minds, pure natures like clear skies,
</p>
<p>And shining galaxies of noble souls.
</p>
<p>Aye, we must have his name and influence.
</p>
<p>He'll be the Brutus of our enterprise.
</p>
<p>Mark. The Cassius thou. Your names as their's
</p>
<p>will be,
</p>
<p>Like double stars blended in history.
</p>
<p>Or greater still, ye'll be the Washington
</p>
<p>And Adams of our revolution. Or
</p>
<p>Epaminonidas and Pelopidas,
</p>
<p>Of Grecian glory, your bright prototypes
</p>
<p>We'll name, in what ye'll yet effect, we trust,
</p>
<p>Of high achievement, for your country wrought
</p>
<p>And proud renown.
</p>
<p>Frank. There were two Adamses
</p>
<p>With scores of patriots and noble men
</p>
<p>Who stood with Washington. E'en so, of us
</p>
<p>There'll be a cluster in the heaven
</p>
<p>Of history.
</p>
<p>Ernest. But think you not, our friend
</p>
<p>Is of a nature all too gently tuned ?
</p>
<p>He's not of the stern mold that Brutus was.

<p>Frank. True, he's of gentle nature : Yet in him
</p>
<p>There is the stuff, that heroes are made of.
</p>
<p>I do remember, one dark gusty night,
</p>
<p>When through the startled city piercing rang
</p>
<p>The cry of "fire". The citizens, awaked
</p>
<p>And guided by the glare, that lit the night,
</p>
<p>Rushed to the conflagration. But too late.
</p>
<p>A stately mansion stood, enwrapped in flames,
</p>
<p>Scene II. THE CONSPIRACY. 11
</p>
<p>That seemed exultingly to sweep the skies
</p>
<p>And bid defiance to the crowd, that stood
</p>
<p>And gazed at them in sad stern impotence.
</p>
<p>When, lo ! a woman's shriek did pierce our ears,
</p>
<p>And swiftly, through the pallid multitude,
</p>
<p>The whisper ran, that 'twas a mother's cry,
</p>
<p>And that her babe was in the burning ruin.
</p>
<p>The mocking fires smote back the rushing crowd,
</p>
<p>That sprang unto the rescue. Baffled shrank
</p>
<p>Brave men, who had stood eye to eye with death.
</p>
<p>And hope died in our hearts. When suddenly
</p>
<p>A youth appeared amidst the flames, that seemed
</p>
<p>To seize him as their victim, as he leaped,
</p>
<p>Fearless amidst them. For an interval,
</p>
<p>A breathless agonizing instant, he
</p>
<p>Was gone, lost to our eager straining sight,
</p>
<p>And the fierce conflagration wildly waved
</p>
<p>Its crests upon the wind, as it had won
</p>
<p>Another prey ; when, lo ! again he came,
</p>
<p>And shook the flames from off him and did place
</p>
<p>The sleeping babe upon its mother's breast.
</p>
<p>That youth was Paul ; and even now the shouts
</p>
<p>King in my ears, with which the people caught
</p>
<p>Him in their arms and bore him home in triumph.
</p>
<p>He's been their model hero since that hour.
</p>
<p>There's slumbering a very iron mine
</p>
<p>In him of force and dauntless energy,
</p>
<p>From whence an Iliad of noble deeds
</p>
<p>And high heroic action might be wrought.
</p>
<p>This very night our club doth meet again.
</p>
<p>Paul will be there and join with us and then
</p>
<p>Within our influence and linked with us
</p>
<p>In patriotic thoughts and aims, we soon
</p>
<p>Will draw him into the conspiracy.

</p>
<p>seats and with the emblems and symbols of the Club. ^ Skel-
</p>
<p>eton in the highest seat. Present Frank and Makk.
</p>
<p>Others coming in.
</p>
<p>Mark. It is a shapely, well developed skull.
</p>
<p>Frank. A shapely, well developed spirit dwelt
</p>
<p>In it. A true proportioned character :
</p>
<p>With that just balance of the faculties,
</p>
<p>That clear cut mold of fine pure elements,
</p>
<p>That as a model, men could look at him,
</p>
<p>And studying his qualities, learn what
</p>
<p>True manhood was, and copying them
</p>
<p>Make real the ideal in themselves.
</p>
<p>His face was Truth's own mirror, where to look
</p>
<p>To see herself, how pure and fair she was.
</p>
<p>And wit and gladness were as natural
</p>
<p>To him, as sparkles to a mountain spring,
</p>
<p>Or ripples to a rill among the hills,
</p>
<p>Or music to a well tuned instrument.
</p>
<p>He was the founder of our Club, and when
</p>
<p>He died, his body he bequeathed to us,
</p>
<p>That we should cherish e'er his memory,
</p>
<p>And think of him whenever we did meet,
</p>
<p>E'en as in life we loved and honored him.
</p>
<p>And so we did preserve his skeleton,
</p>
<p>And voted it perpetual president.
</p>
<p>Mark. A capital presiding officer !
</p>
<p>Most august President ! We bow to thee.
</p>
<p>Frank. There, so. Now let us see how he'll perform.
</p>
<p>He pulls a spring, when it bows and reaches out its arms <J - c, c.
</p>
<p>Mark. 'Tis a most courteous and stately bow.
</p>
<p>Frank. That is the grip initiate ;  and that
</p>
<p>The squeeze of fellowship.
</p>
<p>Mark. A whole souled squeeze.

</p>
<p>Frank. Here, sir ! Lift up your merry face. So. So.
</p>
<p>Your skeleton's the true philosopher.
</p>
<p>It grins, grins ever and at everything,
</p>
<p>As having tried life, death, joy, pain, the grave,
</p>
<p>Ssesk III.] THE CONSPIRACY*.
</p>
<p>It finds them all but matter for a grin.
</p>
<p>Mark. To that philosophy we'll all attain.
</p>
<p>A Bell tolls. Enter Ernest.
</p>
<p>The bell tolls. It struck one. It is the time.
</p>
<p>Frank. Are they all here ?
</p>
<p>Mark. The number is complete..
</p>
<p>Frank, (taking a seat beside the skeleton.)
</p>
<p>It is the hour. All please to order come.
</p>
<p>We'll now commence the sacred mysteries..
</p>
<p>'Tis first in order to initiate
</p>
<p>New members.
</p>
<p>Ernest. There is one who waits without,
</p>
<p>Seeking to be admitted to our band.
</p>
<p>Frank. Into our presence let him now be brought.
</p>
<p>They lead raid in blindfolded and place him before the skeleton,^
</p>
<p>Frank, (addressing Paul.)
</p>
<p>Would'st thou become one of our brotherhood,
</p>
<p>And give thy life up to the sacred work,
</p>
<p>To which we pledge and do devote ourselves ?
</p>
<p>Paul. 'Tis my desire so to devote myself.
</p>
<p>Frank. The aim of our Society is single ;
</p>
<p>And yet it has aims manifold. The first
</p>
<p>The great peculiar end, to which all tends
</p>
<p>Is to achieve our country's liberty.
</p>
<p>For this as means unto this end, we pledge
</p>
<p>Ourselves ever to closest secrecy;
</p>
<p>That ne'er, beyond these ancient vaulted walls,
</p>
<p>Shall breathe a whisper of these mystic rites.
</p>
<p>Then, as a brotherhood, with holiest vows
</p>
<p>Of friendship and affection, we do bind
</p>
<p>Ourselves to cherish ever, each to each,
</p>
<p>Pure faith and trust and gentle sympathy.
</p>
<p>And we are vowed to live lives pure and high,
</p>
<p>By no dishonor stained, or foul wrong deed,

<p>But to each generous, lofty aim devote ;
</p>
<p>That each one may, in life and character,

<p>Exalt himself unto the loftiest reach

<p>Full of great thoughts, sweet scenes and noble acts,.

<p>Which they, the blest, might love oft to rehearse
</p>
<p>For their high pastime, in the happy vales.
</p>
<p>Is there a form of error in the world,

<p>In custom, institution, or creed old,

<p>'Tis ours to battle it. Truth only may we heed.

<p>Beauty for earth and happiness for man,
</p>
<p>The motive and the aim of all our toil.
</p>
<p>For this glad Liberty and gentle Peace
</p>
<p>We'll strive to win, bright visitants from Heaven,
</p>
<p>To make their dwelling here, with Science fair

<p>And Art, bright clad, child of the earth and skies ;

<p>Glorious Art, that yet shall gild our world,

<p>In all its ways, with golden pavements, and

<p>With beauty deck its bowers of blessedness.
</p>
<p>But unto tyranny, and every form
</p>
<p>Of slavery, we do swear unceasing war, 
</p>
<p>A war to end only in victory.
</p>
<p>Wilt thou unto these aims devote thyself
</p>
<p>And join with us in a perpetual league?
</p>
<p>Paul. Unto these lofty aims I pledge myself.
</p>
<p>Frank. Canst thou, as on an altar lay thy life
</p>
<p>And all its aspirations and fond hopes,
</p>
<p>A willing offering to thy fatherland ?
</p>
<p>Paul. Myself and all I am and all I have
</p>
<p>Unto my country freely do I give.
</p>
<p>Frank. Then, with uplifted hand and face to Heaven,
</p>
<p>Swear thou, that to our order thou wilt be
</p>
<p>A faithful brother, even unto death.
</p>
<p>By Him whom thou dost reverence highest, swear.
</p>
<p>Paul. I so do swear. Faithful till death to be.
</p>
<p>Frank. It is enough. Invest him with the robe.

<p>Anna. Have we no bards, like those of days of yore,
</p>
<p>With songs to sing of love and chivalry ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Songs are as gems, gendered in richeet souls,
</p>
<p>In which pure thoughts and sweet words crystalize.
</p>
<p>They are as flowers, with which such souls bloom forth,
</p>
<p>Blossoms of beauty and of melody,
</p>
<p>Blooming and breathing sweetness ceaselessly.
</p>
<p>Dr. John. Oh, for a song like those, that David sung !
</p>
<p>Could he but come again and drink now of
</p>
<p>The water of the well of Bethlehem,
</p>
<p>How would he strike his harp to loftiest strains,
</p>
<p>Sweeter than e'en of old, and Zion yield
</p>
<p>To Calvary the palm of holy song !
</p>
<p>Frank. A prayer ! a prayer, unto your majesties !
</p>
<p>Paul. What is it ? speak ! if in our realm 'tis thine.
</p>
<p>Frank. 'Tis but a dance. Bid the sweet music wake,
</p>
<p>And lead a dance in which we all may join.
</p>
<p>Princess. Would'st thou to vain and idle revelry
</p>
<p>Have us give up these precious, golden hours ?
</p>
<p>What can'st thou urge for such bold rash request ?
</p>
<p>Frank. It is not vain and idle revelry.
</p>
<p>Dancing is natural to man as song ;
</p>
<p>And has in life its true significance,
</p>
<p>Its purpose just and should have its due place.

<p>It is akin to song and melody ;

<p>Of the same pure and gentle parentage.
</p>
<p>'Tis music acted  song in pantomime.
</p>
<p>Music is of the soul and ever thence
</p>
<p>It seeks expression. It doth breathe itself
</p>
<p>Forth in the voice, in concord of sweet sounds?
</p>
<p>And then we call it song and melody.

<p>In tuneful movements of the body, borne

</p>
<p>Upon the flow of inner harmony,
</p>
<p>It vents itself, and then 'tis dance,
</p>
<p>Glad, joy inspiring dance. And in the march,
</p>
<p>It is the soul swell, that uplifts the form,
</p>
<p>And to heroic measures times the step.
</p>
<p>Each an expression, song and dance and march
</p>
<p>Of this soul music. Through all things doth breathe
</p>
<p>This spirit of sweet harmony ;
</p>
<p>And every atom of the universe
</p>
<p>Is ever tremulous with uttering it.
</p>
<p>The whistling winds come dancing o'er the hills,
</p>
<p>And to the self same measures, as they come,
</p>
<p>The groves do spring and all the billows leap,
</p>
<p>In merry glee to join the revelry.
</p>
<p>The stars do swing each other, as they fly,
</p>
<p>And linked in shining orders, hand in hand,
</p>
<p>Wheeling and whirling, dance upon their way.
</p>
<p>And all their mighty, mystic maze  link wove
</p>
<p>With golden link, worlds balancing to worlds,

<p>Systems to systems, groups of glories bright,

<p>And galaxies on galaxies in ranks

<p>Circling the eternal spaces, all are but

<p>An infinite measure, ever wheeling there

<p>And timing to immortal melody.

<p>Do have their frolic dances on the green.

<p>While fed the flocks upon the grassy banks,
</p>
<p>The gentle shepherds, all the summer's day,
</p>
<p>To pipe and harp and merry roundelay,
</p>
<p>With nymphs and naiads danced the hours away.

<p>By the still waters in the pastures green,

<p>Angels and spirits blest, with raptures caught,

<p>And borne on waves of wondrous melodies,

<p>In dance inspired of grace ineffable,

<p>With Israel, before the ark of God,
</p>
<p>Upon its way to Zion,  with glad shouts
</p>
<p>And hymns and peals of myriad instruments.
</p>
<p>And dancing 'twas, he sang, " Worship the Lord
</p>
<p>In the beauty of holiness". For praise
</p>
<p>And prayer and song and dance and every act
</p>
<p>Of gladness and of joy, in Him and in
</p>
<p>His goodness, worship is, and doth show forth
</p>
<p>Rightly the beauty of true holiness.
</p>
<p>The man, that hateth dancing, mark him well,
</p>
<p>He's of distorted temper. Bigotry
</p>
<p>Hath bound its chain about him, fettering
</p>
<p>The natural play and action of his spirit.
</p>
<p>Some chord within his soul is out of tune,
</p>
<p>Discordant, harsh, and gives not its true music.
</p>
<p>Admit him not into your councils. He
</p>
<p>Would in the purest fountains stir up slime,
</p>
<p>And pluck from out life's garden the sweet flowers,
</p>
<p>That God has planted there, to beautify

<p>In that you've made me love and long to come

</p>
<p>'Than sweetest sleep, or brightest dream could be.
</p>
<p>Frank. As sweet to meet, so hard it is to part.
</p>
<p>Oh ! tell me, when shall be the happy time
</p>
<p>When there shall be no parting ; when all mine

<p>Thou'It be, I thine, each other's evermore,

<p>Till death shall part us. When shall be that time ?

<p>To win our country's freed cm, it shall be.
</p>
<p>Then I'll be thine, thine only, wholly thine.
</p>
<p>Then too, I'll prondly claim thee for -mine own,

<p>'Twere treason to divert a thought from her.
</p>
<p>When she is free, how proud I'll be of her,

<p>And of thee too, her brave deliverer.

<p>And that you must be there, to act with them 'I

<p>Frank, Nay, dearest ! Not to be a man. We then
</p>
<p>Had never loved. Thou canst not wish for that.
</p>
<p>Not for what's best in the wide universe,

<p>Would I be otherwise than as I am,

</p>
<p>To be aught otherwise, than as I am
</p>
<p>To thee, except to be nearer and dearer.
</p>
<p>Not less but more would I be unto thee.
</p>
<p>I more would share thy plans, thy thoughts, thy life,

<p>Thy purposes of good, thy noble deeds,

<p>Thy toils and perils in our country's cause.

<p>Paul. Look at that star, yon lone one there, and think
</p>
<p>How infinite the reach of its pale beam,
</p>
<p>Traveling to us from its bright sphere so far.
</p>
<p>So is it with our life and influence!
</p>
<p>The truth we do, or utter goeth forth,
</p>
<p>A beam of light and loseth not its way,
</p>
<p>Amidst remotest centuries.
</p>
<p>Frank. Aye ! even so.
</p>
<p>Paul. The tree bears not it sweet fruits for itself ;
</p>
<p>But 'tis that we may pluck and eat of it.
</p>
<p>And so with golden fruitage of good deeds
</p>
<p>And gentle influence should our lives abound,
</p>
<p>To make the world more happy.
</p>
<p>Frank. 'Tis most true.

<p>Paul. They the true artists are, who, as their days

<p>Are given them, do mould them into lives
</p>
<p>Of beauty ; and he greatest artist is,
</p>
<p>Who makes his life the one most beautiful.

</p>
<p>There is a noble work, an enterprise,

<p>The grandest sir ! in which man can engage.
</p>
<p>Than which earth has no better, loftier one,
</p>
<p>Before us now. It doth appeal to us.
</p>
<p>It craves the aid, it doth demand the aid
</p>
<p>Of all good men and brave, and doth require
</p>
<p>The highest attributes of mind and soul.
</p>
<p>'Tell me, dost thou not love thy country ? sir !
</p>
<p>Paul. My country ? If I know my heart I do.
</p>
<p>Frank. I know thou dost and therefore do I come,,
</p>
<p>Trusting to you. Hast thou not marked, alas !
</p>
<p>The ruin that doth overspread the land ?
</p>
<p>Has not the general cry of misery
</p>
<p>Pierced in thy ears and harrowed up thy soul ?
</p>
<p>Dost thou not see, that this once happy land,
</p>
<p>By Heaven made so -lovely, by man cursed^
</p>
<p>Is prey to outrage, crime and misery ?
</p>
<p>Paul. Alas ! it is too true.
</p>
<p>Frank. Why is it so ?
</p>
<p>Must it thus ever be ?
</p>
<p>Paul. 'Tis clear 'tis not
</p>
<p>Heaven's purpose towards us, for there's given us
</p>
<p>All elements and means of happiness.
</p>
<p>If men would use and order them aright.

<p>Frank. It is that tyranny doth crush the land.
</p>
<p>The King is but a vile and hoary tyrant.
</p>
<p>I'st not so ?
</p>
<p>Paul. Alas ! it is too true.
</p>
<p>Ah ! why does Heaven so lavish power on them,

</p>
<p>Shall we yield tamely, ever to these wrongs,
</p>
<p>And with base acquiescence sanction them ?
</p>
<p>Heaven forbid ! Submission unto wrong
</p>
<p>Is treason to the right. True loyalty
</p>
<p>Is e'er a rebel against tyranny.
</p>
<p>The despot is his country's bitterest foe,
</p>
<p>And with him the true patriot can hold
</p>
<p>No terms but those of strife and enmity.
</p>
<p>With tongue, and pen, nnd sword and dagger too,

<p>And toil, and plot and fight for liberty.
</p>
<p>Paul. Alas I What can we do ? What force have we

<p>To battle with the tyrant's brutal troops ?
</p>
<p>Frank. At least sir, we can do our best,
</p>
<p>And serve our country with what force we have.
</p>
<p>The right is mightier than armies are.
</p>
<p>Let's do our duty, and in doing that,

<p>We will achieve the truest, best success ;

<p>You need make no appeal to me for them.

<p>In the old ruined abbey, in the church,
</p>
<p>A wild, lone place, off in the royal chase,

<p>Just at the forest's edge, where none will come.

<p>Of the old heroes, who in ages past

<p>Have fought for liberty, to come to us
</p>
<p>With help and counsel in our glorious work.
</p>
<p>Come with me. 'Tis at one o'clock we meet ;
</p>
<p>And see ! the broad-faced moon, now at its full,
</p>
<p>And swinging in the vault right opposite
</p>
<p>The sun, is passing the meridian,

<p>Above the forest rises the old tower.
</p>
<p>How spectral -like it stands against the sky !
</p>
<p>Mark. You're right, sir ! Csesarism's bad enough,
</p>
<p>Even with Caesar's glory gilding it ;
</p>
<p>34 THE CONSPIRACY. [Act II.
</p>
<p>But with the Neros and the little Caesars,
</p>
<p>It is a pure, unmitigated curse.
</p>
<p>Frank. With nothing to redeem it.
</p>
<p>Paul. A sham too,
</p>
<p>Poor Caesar's mantle, as in it he fell,
</p>
<p>E'en at the base of Pompey's statua,
</p>
<p>And which should have been buried with him then,
</p>
<p>But which usurpers steal to ape in it
</p>
<p>His vanity and crimes and that  without
</p>
<p>His genius and his generous, grander traits.
</p>
<p>Frank. It is the same old fable of the ass
</p>
<p>In the lion's skin, made true and realized
</p>
<p>In history.
</p>
<p>Mark. With a refreshing change
</p>
<p>And variation of the character
</p>
<p>Of brute, exhibiting in that old skin ;
</p>
<p>Fox, wolf, bear, hog and calf, and now and then,
</p>
<p>In its capacity for shedding blood,
</p>
<p>A specimen of genuine leonine. [quick
</p>
<p>Paul. How strange it seems. If men were wise, how
</p>
<p>Would fall the Caesars and the Juggernauts.
</p>
<p>Frank. Have you heard of the history I've writ ?
</p>
<p>Mark. What you ? No. History of what ?
</p>
<p>Frank. I have it here.
</p>
<p>'Tis this. 'Twill do to read by moonlight.
</p>
<p>He reads.
</p>
<p>An ass found a dead lion's skin.
</p>
<p>With wring and twist he crept therein,
</p>
<p>He shook the mane f he reared the tail ,
</p>
<p>While all the beasts around did quail.
</p>
<p>At length a bear did cross his way ;
</p>
<p>At him the ass a roar did bray.
</p>
<p>The bear, no bastard bear was he,
</p>
<p>Rushed at the ass right bearishly,

<p>From off him stripped the imperial skin,
</p>
<p>And straightway in his place crept in.
</p>
<p>Paul. Ha, ha ! What name give you your history?
</p>
<p>Frank. The sequel to " Theirs' empire."

</p>
<p>Frank. May hap yon may :  wait a decade or so.
</p>
<p>Mark. Come sir ! Now prophesy. How long think you
</p>
<p>This old imperial skin will last, to serve
</p>
<p>These bears and asses thus to fool men with ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Well, 'tis a tough old hide. It has endured
</p>
<p>Some nineteen centuries. And sir ! the blood
</p>
<p>That they, who've aped the imperial brute in it,
</p>
<p>Have caused to flow, is as a river is
</p>
<p>Unto a rivulet, to what has served
</p>
<p>To slake the thirst of all the genuine brutes
</p>
<p>That through these centuries have raged o'er earth.
</p>
<p>A tough old hide, but cracked and rotten now.
</p>
<p>'Tis in its twentieth century, but 'twill
</p>
<p>Not last it out. If you do, you will see
</p>
<p>The end of it. That is my prophesy.

<p>Hist ! Who comes there ?
</p>
<p>Mark. 'Tis Julian. Mark his stealthy gait !
</p>
<p>Frank, He has a certain look, that answers pat
</p>
<p>To my idea of Judas.
</p>
<p>Paul. It is said
</p>
<p>That he has won the favor of the king.
</p>
<p>Frank. By flattery he wins the tyrant's ear.
</p>
<p>Mark. He's shrewd and cunning.
</p>
<p>Frank. Aye, mere cunning, sir !
</p>
<p>And cunning is but wisdom's counterfeit ;
</p>
<p>A poor and shallow one. He's hollow, false,
</p>
<p>And lacks the true, substantial qualities.
</p>
<p>Paul. Falsehood is ever shallow, hollow, null.
</p>
<p>Truth only is substantial, solid, sure.
</p>
<p>Dishonesty is ever a mistake.
</p>
<p>The lack of honesty is lack of sense,
</p>
<p>Of due perception of the scope of things,
</p>
<p>Of their relations and true harmonies,
</p>

<p>The rascal ever is a fool, at least
</p>
<p>To the extent of his rascality.
</p>
<p>And hence I rather pity him than blame,
</p>
<p>And in the treatment of the criminal,

<p>I ever with the prison would combine

</p>
<p>Julian. 'Tis wrong Ha ! Tut ! Mere names these,
</p>
<p>Virtue ! Pooh ! 'Tis mere talk,  a name devised, 
</p>
<p>An artificial sentimental sweet,
</p>
<p>To sugar o'er tame deeds to weakly souls.
</p>
<p>That's right to me, that rightly serves my will,
</p>
<p>And that is wrong, that thwarts me ;  that's my creed :
</p>
<p>The true one for a resolute brave soul.
</p>
<p>Of universal being, 'tis the law,
</p>
<p>Each atom to itself all else to draw,
</p>
<p>Itself the centre of the universe.
</p>
<p>The cloud passes from the moon.
</p>
<p>Ha ! who is here ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Good evening, sir ! [is this
</p>
<p>Julian. Ha ! Frank ! and Mark ! and Paul ! and who
</p>
<p>That stands with you, so stiff and statuelike,
</p>
<p>Mantled and masked in such strange mystery ?
</p>
<p>Frank. Nay, sir ! You see he doth disguise himself.
</p>
<p>Wisdom pries not in what concerns it not :
</p>
<p>Of its own proper food it heaps its store ;
</p>
<p>And like a thrifty husbandman it digs
</p>
<p>In its own field.
</p>
<p>Julian. 'Tis guilt and cowardice,
</p>
<p>That mask themselves and lurk round in the dark.
</p>
<p>Frank. Ha, Ha ! Is that the view you take of it ?
</p>
<p>Well, sir ! this is a face that need not mask
</p>
<p>Its beauty from the moon. Nor fear nor shame
</p>
<p>Can start a blush in it. Look ! Is it not
</p>
<p>An open and an honest countenance ?

<p>We're all but skeletons with skin o'er them,

<p>You might as well thus tremble "when you look

</p>
<p>And that same ghastly grin will mock at you.

<p>Curse them. They laugh and jeer at me. Well let
</p>
<p>Them have their jest. I'll have mine too ere long,
</p>
<p>And echo back their laughter at them yet.
</p>
<p>But what means this ? There is some mystery here.
</p>
<p>There's something up, when skeletons do walk.
</p>
<p>Mystery's the cloak, that mischief ever wears
</p>
<p>To do its dark work in. I'll hie with this
</p>
<p>Unto the King and set the spies on them.
</p>
<p>Already I'm his favorite. I'd stake
</p>
<p>My life against a butterfly's, that I
</p>
<p>Could bend him unto any whim I'd choose,
</p>
<p>So that it be some vain and wicked thing.
</p>
<p>He's doubtless an old tyrant, a mere beast,
</p>
<p>Drunken and brutish, and his tyranny
</p>
<p>Rests fearfully upon the realm. These wars
</p>
<p>He madly wages and his cruelties
</p>
<p>Do make him hated, and the citizens
</p>
<p>Are ripe for insurrection, and do nurse
</p>
<p>Imaginings and dreams of liberty.
</p>
<p>E'en now their leaders do in council meet,
</p>
<p>And I have pledged myself to meet with them ;
</p>
<p>And would do so, but suddenly the King
</p>
<p>Thus fancies me, and through him best I see
</p>
<p>My way unto my own peculiar aims.
</p>
<p>Hence I'll at once reveal to him their plots.

<p>The fair divinities of air and sea.

<p>Through time and space, will show to us the way,

</p>
<p>This life of ours, this strength, even our wills

<p>Our thoughts and acts are not our own, but His,

<p>Imagine to ourselves, what thought or deed

<p>Would become Him and fearless then we should
</p>
<p>Do it exultingly. And there's no act
</p>
<p>However dread it be, but it, so done,
</p>
<p>Is good in us and Godlike, even as if
</p>
<p>'Twere wrought by His right hand. Would it not then

<p>Be a most blessed deed, if God would take

<p>This tyrant from the earth ? Then why not too

<p>I'll with this question go once more to Heaven ;

<p>Instinct with soul and sense and thought and joy ;
</p>
<p>And Nature doth delight in all her works,

<p>Even with a joy infinite as her might.
</p>
<p>And these her wondrous movements thrill her frame,

<p>As when great thoughts move o'er the soul of man.

<p>Upon the earth, I would not leave undone,

<p>Not for the brightest of yon golden seats.

<p>Or seraph with thy home in Heaven, and thence
</p>
<p>Oft times to go out, visiting amidst
</p>
<p>Yon shining worlds, a messenger of light
</p>
<p>On holy errands ? Thou could'st then come back

<p>Unto thy native earth, to do thy works

<p>Of love and mercy.

</p>
<p>There's a time coming, when I hope to be

<p>Vaul. It is
</p>
<p>That I could be awhile omnipotent,
</p>
<p>With power to execute on earth, what I
</p>
<p>Would love to do. There'd be a change here then.
</p>
<p>For I have thoughts of beauty in my soul,
</p>
<p>That wrought out would make earth all glorious,

<p>As if with jasper walls and gates all pearl

<p>And golden pavements built it cities were.

</p>
<p>The elements of glory all are here;
</p>
<p>Richest material for the new Heaven.
</p>
<p>The marbles waiting lie beneath the hills,
</p>
<p>Yet crop out looking round for architects.
</p>
<p>How easy, if men would, 'twould be, to rear
</p>
<p>Them into palaces. Ah ! were men wise,
</p>
<p>This world might be all beauty, life all joy.
</p>
<p>The hills with burnished domes would gleam afar ;
</p>
<p>The valleys all would happy valleys be,
</p>
<p>And all the isles be islands of the blest.
</p>
<p>Vrincess, I wish thou could'st have such omnipotence.
</p>
<p>Enter the Prince and an Officer of the Palace.
</p>
<p>Vrince. The insurrection in the city spreads. 
</p>
<p>They seem to march this way. I fear their plan
</p>
<p>Is to attack the palace and thus aim
</p>
<p>The blow they strike at the most vital part.
</p>
<p>Officer. With fiercer blow we'll meet and parry it 
</p>
<p>Our guns will give them greeting as they come.
</p>
<p>Enter a Servant.
</p>
<p>Servant. The mob is marching hither and their cry
</p>
<p>Is " To the Palace"  "Death unto the King." [troops.
</p>
<p>Vrincess. Heaven help us, should they overpower the
</p>
<p>Servant. Or should the soldiers fraternize with them,
</p>
<p>And join the work of pillage and of blood.
</p>
<p>Vrincess. Alas! Is there such danger ?, Then indeed
</p>
<p>To Heaven must we look. [To Vaul) You will not leave us
</p>
<p>The people love you. They will heed your voice,
</p>
<p>Better than armor or of brass or steel
</p>
<p>Is the bright panoply that Love puts on.
</p>
<p>I choose you as my knight, to watch for me
</p>
<p>And guard me through the perils of this night.

<p>Officer. Dead in a drunken sleep,
</p>
<p>They brought him senseless from the night's debauch.

<p>The trump of doom could not awaken him.

<p>He lies in yonder chamber. That's the door.

</p>
<p>"Paul. Ha ! Bid'st thou mean to point the way to me ?
</p>
<p>Prince. Hark ! Hear those cries again ? Let us go out
</p>
<p>And learn what they do mean. Paul ! you remain,
</p>
<p>We'll soon return and make report and then
</p>
<p>Council of war together we will hold.
</p>
<p>The gentle Princess doth rely on you.
</p>
<p>Paul. So, Heaven is working it.
</p>
<p>Officer. Heaven working it ?
</p>
<p>'Tis Hell you mean. It must be thence that comes
</p>
<p>The inspiration, that impels these fiends.
</p>
<p>Hark, hear them yell ! A legion at the least
</p>
<p>Is busy now at some devil's work, devised
</p>
<p>For them in hell. Watch you till we return.
</p>
<p>The Princess' room is next unto the King's.
</p>
<p>Keep you near there. She may require your aid.
</p>
<p>The King's not like to wake or trouble you.
</p>
<p>Paul. 'Tis very likely that he will sleep well.
</p>
<p>IZzeunt all but Paul.
</p>
<p>'Tis clearly Heaven's appointment. It is so.
</p>
<p>It is a duty. It is more than right.
</p>
<p>It is a duty. It will be an act,
</p>
<p>In the esteem of thoughtful just souled men,
</p>
<p>Noble and righteous. Good men will approve

<p>Polluted and by every law condemned.

<p>While by it lives unnumbered will be saved,

<p>Thus too tlie Princess I can best protect,

<p>For were he dead, I could at once go forth

<p>Unto the people and proclaim his death ;

<p>Then he would start  and gaze into the air,
</p>
<p>Then clench his hand and mutter to himself,

<p>And drop and shake his head, all lost in thought.
</p>
<p>As if he meditated some dread deed,

</p>
<p>Citizen. What cries are these that come upon the breeze ?
</p>
<p>Ernest. It is some tumult in the city. But

<p>That we must stay to man the barricade,
</p>
<p>I would go forth to learn what it may be.

<p>Shouting and roar of guns, and with the breeze,

<p>Billows of music swell upon the ear.

<p>They've waited for the night to arm themselves ;

<p>And now they march with shouts and songs in bands

<p>To join the insurrection.

</p>
<p>How red the day-break lightens up the sky.
</p>
<p>Ernest. Nay. Midnight has not struck. It is the glare

<p>Of conflagration. The city is a fire.
</p>
<p>See how those flames curl round yon eastern tower,

<p>As if hell from beneath were bursting forth.

<p>They seem to lick the skies with their forked tongues.

</p>
<p>I've writ my reasons here for what I do,
</p>
<p>That should they kill me, as most like they will,
</p>
<p>They'll see I acted in it righteously.
</p>
<p>And chiefly that the Princess thus may know
</p>
<p>Why I did slay her sire and that she may
</p>
<p>Be more induced by it to rule the realm
</p>
<p>In love and righteousness and gentle peace.
</p>
<p>And haply too earth's tyrants thus may learn
</p>
<p>Elsewhere that justice may awake for them.
</p>
<p>How innocent thou look'st, dread instrument !
</p>
<p>Blood may be wiped from thee, but will its stain
</p>
<p>E'er leave the soul ? I'll think no more of it,
</p>
<p>But to the work at once. Yet first I'll kneel
</p>
<p>A moment, the last time perchance on earth,
</p>
<p>And ope my heart and all its thoughts to Heaven.
</p>
<p>He kneels, then soon starts up, dropping the manuscript.
</p>
<p>Is it a troop of spirits that I see ?
</p>
<p>Or an illusion is't ? Bright beings there

<p>Do hover o'er the King. They beck to me.

<p>Ye blessed messengers ! Is it to aid

<p>Me in the bloody work, that ye do come ?

<p>Will ye receive his spirit in its flight ?

<p>I would not harm his soul, but for his crown
</p>
<p>Of earth would give him a celestial one.

<p>They're gone. Was it illusion ? Am I mad ?

<p>Yet will I take it as a sign from Heaven.

<p>And of her sweet and heavenly qualities.

</p>
<p>He opens and reads the manuscript.

<p>His writing !
</p>
<p>I found it on the floor by the King's bed.

<p>That shows that he was there. What does it say ?

<p>It shows most plainly, -'tis proof positive,

<p>He had it in his mind to kill the King,

<p>And in some way by poison or foul means
</p>
<p>He's wrought his purpose and has murdered him.

<p>And all the same as murdered me ; my hopes

<p>All blighted, dead in the King's death, while he

<p>Will love and triumph. In the Queen's love
</p>
<p>What height is there to which he may not climb?
</p>
<p>Yet, ha, I'll have him yet. I will rush forth
</p>
<p>And straight proclaim him as the murderer ;
</p>
<p>She cannot love her father's murderer ;
</p>
<p>And I'll so demonstrate his guilt to her,
</p>
<p>That hate and horror from her heart will drive
</p>
<p>A love so guilty and unnatural.
</p>
<p>Yet no, not yet. He'll have confederates.
</p>
<p>The mob do love him and me they do hate.

<p>And though we now and then may catch some strain

<p>I'll watch my chance and in his very top
