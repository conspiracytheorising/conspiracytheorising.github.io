</p>
<p>PREFACE:
</p>
<p>All inhabitants of these U. S. may be viewed as constituting two
</p>
<p>parties, viz: 1st. Monarchists, and 2d. Republicans. If we ask
</p>
<p>those professing citizenship in this Republic, to which of the be-
</p>
<p>fore-named two parties each of them belongs, we presume very few
</p>
<p>among them would dare to confess that they belong to the party of
</p>
<p>Monarchists; but most would say they belong to the Republican,
</p>
<p>class ; although a large number of them would tell this hypocritical-
</p>
<p>Jy, knowing well that they support the Pope of Rome, the Monarch
</p>
<p>of Monarchs; or that they are supporting some of the Monarchs
</p>
<p>who are directed and controlled by the Pope and his Priests, or by
</p>
<p>Protestant Ministers who have more or less of Popish tradition which
</p>
<p>tends to monarchy. This is fact, even though the larger portion of
</p>
<p>Monarchists in this Republic may be ignorant that they are suppo?t-
</p>
<p>ing Monarchs, because the Papal Imperial royal powers through a
</p>
<p>Jong course of centuries have learned such a system of politics,
</p>
<p>that they can affect and influence free nations in such a gradual
</p>
<p>manner as to make them entirely mature for the Popish Imperial
</p>
<p>Royal, or Anti-Christian government. Now, in this country they
</p>
<p>ihave advanced thus far. Attention! readers of the following
</p>
<p>pages.
</p>
<p>Attentive readers may see and judge for themselves in what
</p>
<p>manner and in how great a degree this Republic has been ruined
</p>
<p>by monarchists, and this while citizens who desire to be true repub-
</p>
<p>licans were not aware of the most treacherous machinations to make
</p>
<p>it a Papal Imperial Royal Empire; nor did they understand the
</p>
<p>real nature and tendency of many facts which have taken place, to
</p>
<p>change this republic into various monarchies, although these facts
</p>
<p>were published either by traitors to this country, or by ignoramuses
</p>
<p>of what every true republican, especially editors of newspapers,
</p>
<p>should have known, as having some other tendency than the ruin of
</p>
<p>this republic. How many editors, professing to be Protestants, have
</p>
<p>published many columns in their papers respecting the Irish refugee
</p>
<p>Meagher, and patriot as he is called, and his speeches? Have any
</p>
<p>of them penetrated into the depths of his movements? Have they

</p>
<p>in this respect opened the eyes of their readers, or of their brother
</p>
<p>editors, by representing his movements as they should be represent-
</p>
<p>ed? If such editors rTad taken into consideration only these circum-
</p>
<p>stances, that Meagher's family, one of the richest in Ireland, had
</p>
<p>[4]
</p>
<p>advanced so far in the worship of the Holy Father, the Pope of
</p>
<p>Rome, (who, according- to true republican principles, is the most
</p>
<p>dreadful Monarch, and fell destroyer of human rights,) that a broth-
</p>
<p>er of this Meagher became Captain of the Pope's Guard, they had
</p>
<p>soon discovered the proper tendency of his movements in America,
</p>
<p>and informed the people ol this republic of their highest duties un-
</p>
<p>der these circumstances.
</p>
<p>But alas! among the many classes of citizens in this country we
</p>
<p>find, among editors of newspapers, officials, office seekers and priests
</p>
<p>of all sects, the larger portions of those by whom this Republic is
</p>
<p>ruined, nor can it be saved from the grasp of Monarchs with weap-
</p>
<p>ons of iron, but by a true conversion of the people to the principles
</p>
<p>of truth and righteousness, as they are unfolded and disclosed at
</p>
<p>the present manifestation of Christ's Spirit, by instrumentality of
</p>
<p>our mission, to arouse nations for co-operation, to establish the true
</p>
<p>Church of Christ, usually called the Millennial Church, which will
</p>
<p>be the great Republic, in which Truth, Righteousness and Peace,
</p>
<p>that is, Christ's Spirit, will reign.
</p>
<p>This nation must be converted, i. e,: become truly republican, or
</p>
<p>which is the same, truly Christian, free from all sects and parties,
</p>
<p>entirely open to conviction, ready to receive truth, whenever it ap*
</p>
<p>pears sufficiently proved, and to act accordingly, or it must be partly
</p>
<p>destroyed in revolutions and wars, and its people subjugated by
</p>
<p>Monarchs. Matters have arrived so far, that if a sufficient number
</p>
<p>of those who desire to be true republicans, will refuse to unite in
</p>
<p>Christ's spirit, being ready to forsake all things, when truth and
</p>
<p>righteousness demand the sacrifice, they cannot be delivered from
</p>
<p>the hands of Monarchs. If the people of these U. S. continue to,
</p>
<p>be so sectarian, each one so attached to his religious association, or,
</p>
<p>political party; if editors of newspapors, publishers of periodicals
</p>
<p>and'books, and if officials continue to be so corrupt as I have found
</p>
<p>them, while traveling in more than twenty of the United States,
</p>
<p>and applying to influential men of different religious sects and poli-
</p>
<p>tical creeds, as also to open and secret societies, whenever I had
</p>
<p>opportunity to meet with them, then most certainly after all the

</p>
<p>preparations which have been made, the Pope of Rome will not re-
</p>
<p>quire much assistance from his first-born sons and daughters, the
</p>
<p>Emperors, Kings and Queens, to bring into his Church, or kill by
</p>
<p>his inquisition the members of the three hundred sects of heretics
</p>
<p>or rebels, which are in this country, and to divide this Republic into
</p>
<p>Monarchies and give them Kings of such families as have given
</p>
<p>him the greatest assistance in the subjugation of heretics.
</p>
<p>According to his principles he regards all Protestants as heretics,
</p>
<p>those excepted who, under mask of Protestantism, render greater
</p>
<p>service to his infernal schemes, than if they would appear as open
</p>
<p>papists. And since his principle is, "Divided regna;" divide thy
</p>
<p>adversaries into as many sects and parties as possible, and then thou
</p>
<p>wilt obtain the power and government over them ail, is it not evi-
</p>
<p>dent that his cause is a hopeful one? Besides, the heads of Pro-
</p>
<p>[5]
</p>
<p>Aslant sects and political parties, knew, and know well, how to give
</p>
<p>the best assistance to their Pope in Rome, and have divided the
</p>
<p>Protestant body in the United States into more than three hundred
</p>
<p>religious sects, and Priests or Ministers in all these sects become
</p>
<p>servants of the Pope, by supporting each one his own sect, instead
</p>
<p>of supporting the true Protestant or true Christian principle, which
</p>
<p>is the principle of free discussion, and spreading of truth when 'tis
</p>
<p>made manifest by free discussion.
</p>
<p>When I applied to Protestants for the use of their meeting-houses
</p>
<p>for preaching, some among them were willing to give them, parti-
</p>
<p>cularly when I assured them that I would explain prophesies re-
</p>
<p>garding the Pope of Rome, But when I mentioned that the popish
</p>
<p>church is the Mother, and'fhat their sects and parties are her dear
</p>
<p>daughters and grand daughters, and that the leaders of sects were
</p>
<p>small popes or small tyrants, they united with papists in persecu-
</p>
<p>ting me. I could scarcely believe it to be possible on reading (be-
</p>
<p>fore, my departure from the seaport of Trieste for America,) a Ger-
</p>
<p>man work explaining the tenets of the three hundred sects of the
</p>
<p>United.States and their abominable deeds. But alas! it is but too
</p>
<p>true. In my travels and labors in this country I have met with
</p>
<p>divisions and sub-divisions of sects, and I have found their number
</p>
<p>\yas not exaggerated.
</p>
<p>No person, can be a true disciple of Christ if he is not ready to
</p>
<p>forsake his lather and mother, wife xmd children, and all his pro-
</p>
<p>perty, when Christ and Bis cause requires him to do so; nor is any
</p>
<p>person, a true Republican, or true Christian, if he is not ready to
</p>
<p>corUe out from his sect or his party, and profess the true Republican
</p>
<p>or true Christian principle; to prove or investigate freely all things
</p>
<p>which are of importance for the true Republic, or the true Church
</p>
<p>oi Christ, and to hold fast and spread in the world that which is.
</p>
<p>good or beneficial to and for mankind.
</p>
<p>I would be a traitor to my mission, which is the mission of every
</p>
<p>true Christian, if I were afraid to declare truth, that I might not
</p>
<p>oflend any party/n* sect of Babylon, or confusion and delusion, all
</p>
<p>of which must and will disappear, and in and on its place the Hea-

</p>
<p>venly Jerusalem, or Truth and righteousness according to the true
</p>
<p>Republican or true Christian principle will be established. And
</p>
<p>we have the promise of Heavenly assistance in establishing it.
</p>
<p>But if Americans will continue to treat the true republican prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, supported by me, in such manner as I have experienced un-
</p>
<p>til now, I will then have greater hope sooner to convert my Slavo-
</p>
<p>nian nation and the Emperor of Russia as their representative into
</p>
<p>true republicans, than citizens of these U. S. But I act as a true
</p>
<p>citizen of this republic, in hope that people at length will be aroused
</p>
<p>from their incredible lethargy.
</p>
<p>Now, after many and various trials for this purpose I have writ-
</p>
<p>ten the following pages in tjjjis city of Pittsburgh, and have made
</p>
<p>many applications to private persons as well as to representatives of
</p>
<p>such societies as are boasting that they are maintaining the true
</p>
<p>[6]
</p>
<p>wpral/litan principle; but each of them when tried by me, it was
</p>
<p>found that they were supporting the monarchical principle, and
</p>
<p>therefore I could get no assistance from them to publish theso
</p>
<p>ipages.
</p>
<p>Then I took my departure from Allegheny county and proceeded
</p>
<p>'to one which I thought to be less subjugated by the Papal Imperial
</p>
<p>SRoyal powers* than any other county in Pennsylvania. In this I
</p>
<p>ipreached in a number of churches, explaining prophesies and the
</p>
<p>signs of the times, aii>o obtaining names of subscribers for printing
</p>
<p>'the following pages. But when success had nearly crowned my
</p>
<p>efforts, a Papist, (digging coals near to a village, in the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>church of which village I was preaching,) has shown that he exer-
</p>
<p>cised such a power not only over a large audience in a Presbyterian
</p>
<p>meeting-house, but also over the Judge, the Court, the Bar, Justices
</p>
<p>of the Peace, and the whole county, that I had to run from the
</p>
<p>place, where I could find no refuge or justice. Then I returned to
</p>
<p>Allegheny county, in hopes that the case which will be annexed to
</p>
<p>these pages, written many weeks before this preface, will at length
</p>
<p>open the eyes of citizens of this county to publish my pamphlet,
</p>
<p>and to act with me for the support and spreading of the true repub-
</p>
<p>lican or true christian cause.
</p>
<p>This preface was written on the 29th day of November, 1853,
</p>
<p>"tn vigilia sancti Andrex Apostoli" the 16th anniversary of my
</p>
<p>arrival in America, and the 58th anniversary of my birth-day; be-
</p>
<p>cause it was the same day and the same hour when I first touched
</p>
<p>American soil as when, I was born, 42 years before that, *m civitate
</p>
<p>collapsu" which in my native language is called Kamnik, in Ger-
</p>
<p>man Stein, in English Stone of lliyria or Illyricum: Rom. xv:l9;
</p>
<p>and I hope that the American people will begin to be born for the
</p>
<p>true republican and true christian principle, and that they will co-
</p>
<p>operate for the redemption of mankind from the yoke of monarchs
</p>
<p>with their sincere brother and fellow-citizen,

<p>[7]
</p>
<p>PERSONS AND PARTIES;
</p>
<p>PRINCIPLES AND OPERATIONS,
</p>
<p>Considered with reference to the Dispensation of
</p>
<p>the Fulness of Times. Eph, 1:10,
</p>
<p>There are two classes of persons among men, who not only hin-
</p>
<p>der but prevent the introduction of Harmony, Peace and Happiness,
</p>
<p>lo which the people are entitled in virtue of their intellectual and
</p>
<p>moral faculties, and physical strength to realize them, but also in virtue
</p>
<p>of the promise given by the prophetical spirit which foresaw and
</p>
<p>foretold its realization.
</p>
<p>To the first class belong those deluded people who think the te-
</p>
<p>nets of their church cannot be improved, and endeavor to remain in
</p>
<p>a pef^etual stagnation, supporting blindly such principles asf wf>en
</p>
<p>examined with a sound mind, and in application of all the means
</p>
<p>which knowledge and science can afford, appear not to be according
</p>
<p>to truth, but accordant with delusion; not to be beneficial, but perni-
</p>
<p>cious, and therefore not to be tolerated, bnt abolished, by spreading1
</p>
<p>light on<subjects which men should know to enable them to enjoy
</p>
<p>that happiness which they are able to realize by uniting knowledge
</p>
<p>and strength for the common welfare.
</p>
<p>The second class are those persons among the people who have
</p>
<p>discovered that Churches should not be in stagnation, but in progres-
</p>
<p>sion; but who are not prepared to penetrate through the surface of
</p>
<p>creeds into the depths of realities, to perceive truth as it will be per-
</p>
<p>ceived by the application of the whole amount of human knowl-
</p>
<p>edge, and who, instead of occupying a higher ground than the pres-
</p>
<p>ent churches do occupy, descend to a level with beasts, and in their
</p>
<p>brutal ignorance of all the testimonies which were given through
</p>
<p>the course of centuries, and continue to be given in a great abun-
</p>
<p>dance in our time, for the continuation of the personal existence of
</p>
<p>man in his interior body after his departure from his corruptible or
</p>
<p>exterior body* and his close connexion with his congenial friends
</p>
<p>living in their corruptible bodies, they are trusting in weapons of
</p>
<p>war to destroy tyrants, not knowing that these weapons are unfit for
</p>
<p>the introduction of a reasonable or christian government, and that

</p>
<p>with these weapons if one tyrant is destroyed, a number of others
</p>
<p>are raised, to divide amongst themselves the prey, from which they
</p>
<p>may have repelled their antagonists.
</p>
<p>C 8 ]'
</p>
<p>Now, the wrong course of these two classes of persons hereto-
</p>
<p>fore has been the main cause of the destruction of human life and
</p>
<p>property, occasioning hindrances to the progression of our race to-
</p>
<p>wards the promised New Era of Harmony and Peace. And these
</p>
<p>two classes are still preparing weapons in great abundance for the
</p>
<p>destruction of life and property, as if there was not for men a nobler
</p>
<p>destiny than learning the art of butchering each other.
</p>
<p>In the year 1832, which was the thirteenth of my Priesthood and
</p>
<p>fifth of my Professorship in the Roman Catholic Church, and after
</p>
<p>having been (for what happened) duly prepared by continuous stu-
</p>
<p>dies, from earliest youth, besides having an earnest desire to learn
</p>
<p>to know truth, that I might act accordingly, for the good of man,
</p>
<p>and welfare of the human race. 'Twas then my eyes were so un-
</p>
<p>expectedly and wonderfully opened that I began to understand the
</p>
<p>prophetical position of the Roman Church and her daughters, andv
</p>
<p>the signs of the times, according to prophecies, for their abolition
</p>
<p>by Christ's spirit, and for the introduction of Christ's 'peaceable
</p>
<p>reign1, or the Great Republic in which nations will be united in and
</p>
<p>by the spirit of truth and righteousness.'
</p>
<p>From that period till now L have been preparing to give testimo'
</p>
<p>ny in due season, respecting that which had been disclosed to me;
</p>
<p>but experiencing that the Austrian government, under which I held
</p>
<p>and performed my offices before-mentioned, Was not ready to exam-
</p>
<p>ine my testimony, much less spread it in the world, I then Wd to
</p>
<p>depart for America. For that purpose, a passport from the govern-
</p>

<p>volumes, which were printed from '1S*5S to 1842, But by the ex-
</p>
<p>ertions of the above mentioned two classes, the circulation of my
</p>
<p>volumes was stopped, and the Papal Imperial Royal agency against-
</p>
<p>the liberties of this country was patronized powerfully not only by"
</p>
<p>Romanists, but also by Protestants, who preferred private interests
</p>
<p>to the common welfare, else they werje- deceived so that they thought'
</p>
<p>they were supporting a true Republican, which is the same' ar^ a:
</p>
<p>true Christian; whilst they were supporting a Monarchical, which
</p>
<p>is the same as anti-Christian government, and they steadily refused!
</p>
<p>to pay attention to my message, in which these matters are explain-
</p>
<p>ed. By ignorance of- these things, in the year 1848, bloody'revo-
</p>
<p>lutions and wars, which had been predicted in rny puMdfttibnsv
</p>
<p>broke out in Europe, and chained nations with new sha^kels^ ftttgej$
</p>
<p>by Monarchs, when as in use and by application* of means shoW&*
</p>
<p>[9]
</p>
<p>in my writings, Monarchies of this world would have been convert-
</p>
<p>ed in a peaceable manner into the Great Republic which will ba
</p>
<p>Christ's peaceable reign on earth. While revolutions and wars
</p>
<p>were raging dreadfully in Europe, I thonght it the proper time
</p>
<p>to commence, in a new manner, to exhort Bishops and others to ex-
</p>
<p>amine my Message of Peace and the credentials of my Mission,
</p>
<p>which is the mission of every true Christian.
</p>
<p>At that time I was aroused, by peculiar circumstances, to invite,
</p>
<p>fjy letter, Michael O'Connor, Roman Catholic Bishop in this city of
</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, to appoint a time and place for a public reading of my
</p>
<p>Latin Manuscript, in which is concentrated what every true Chris-
</p>
<p>tian should know, to co-operate for the union and peace of nations,
</p>
<p>end which I wrote in Latin that it might be sent to the Pope and all
</p>
<p>his Cardinals and Bishops, because they are the first in duty bound
</p>
<p>to act for this co-operation, because the follies of their administration
</p>
<p>have produced, in the Christian Church, the two above-mentioned
</p>
<p>classes of people, by whom revolutions and wars were nurtured
</p>
<p>through the Jong course of many Christian centuries, and who ar
</p>
<p>now preparing the most tremendous destruction of human life and
</p>
<p>property. I invited the Bishop to appear with as many Divines
</p>
<p>as he could assemble, that they might first hear the reading of my
</p>
<p>Latin Manuscript, and then reply in writing what they should deem
</p>
<p>proper, that their leply with my remarks might be annexed to my
</p>
<p>manuscript and published in Latin and in translations, that every
</p>
<p>person might be able to examine matters for themselves and learn
</p>
<p>what is most needed for the harmony and peace of nations. And
</p>
<p>in the first place, that Bishops might,do this, because their anti-
</p>
<p>christian proceedings advance m these United States in the same
</p>
<p>manner as they did in France, and caused that dreadful Revolution
</p>
<p>in which, at the end of the last century, besides hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands of others, also twenty-four thousand Priests, that is, aM Priests
</p>
<p>who did not escape, were killed in France. The Bishop answered
</p>
<p>my long Latin letter in a short manner. His answer is very suitable
</p>
<p>to the present circumstances, therefore I publish it here verbatim et
</p>
<p>punctuatim, in Latin and in English, as follows:

</p>
<p>M< O'Ccnnor, Bishop of Pittsburgh, to Andrew Smolnikar: 
</p>
<p>What you assert without reason in regard to learned Priests, is very
</p>
<p>often true in regard to those who call themselves Christ's Legafes, to
</p>
<p>wit; that they are Infidels. Whereas you have constituted your-
</p>
<p>self, by your apostacy, outward of Christ's Church, you are out of
</p>
<p>her body, and you have rejected the Faith, without which it is im-
</p>
<p>possible to please God. Therefore, it is of small concern what you
</p>
<p>teach, because you teach outward, although, as alt other heretics,
</p>
<p>you endeavor to extort your doctrine from Scripture.
</p>
<p>For us it is sufficient to know that Jesus Christ, who is yesterday*
</p>
<p>to-day and all times, has provided the means by which we are able
</p>
<p>to learn what is needtul or useful lor salvation; to wit, he has left us-
</p>
<p>the way to salvatiori in the Church cleansed with bis blood. To
</p>
<p>this Church, which derives her strength from Christ, although she
</p>
<p>is rejected by heretics and apostates, we inhere and despise the fee-
</p>
<p>ble threats of those who call themselves "Christ's Legates," and who1
</p>
<p>(if you require a sign of their extraordinary legation,) are not able
</p>
<p>to restore a lame dog to his health.
</p>
<p>I pray God with all my heart that you might repent the execra-
</p>
<p>ble crime of apostacy, and that you might partake of the salvation
</p>
<p>whtch Christ prayed also for his executioners. That it might hap-
</p>
<p>pen, it is necessary that you regret with all your heart the blasphe-
</p>
<p>my with which you. constitute yourself Christ's Legate and reject
</p>
<p>those whom he has constituted, and mend your life.

<p>Given in Pittsburgh on the 3d day of March, 1849.

</p>
<p>then to write an extended treatise to show all the follies contained
</p>
<p>in this answer, in which the spirit by whom Popish Bishops and
</p>
<p>Priests are inspired is made manifest. I mentioned in my letter
</p>
<p>that in my Latin manuscript, to the examination of which I invited
</p>
<p>him and his clergy, the credentials of our mission is concentrated.
</p>
<p>These credentials have been given for all men and women, by whosfc
</p>
<p>instrumentality the promised New Era will be established. Tbe^
</p>
<p>appear according to prophecies as Christ's Legates for the introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times: Eph. 1:10, in which
</p>
<p>nations will be united, not in the Pope of Rome, but in the'Spirit of
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, which is the Spirit of Truth ar*d Righteousness, Harmo-
</p>
<p>ny and Peace, and they will show their true faith by their works;
</p>
<p>["3
</p>
<p>but in Popedom many learned Priests prore to be Infidels, supporting
</p>
<p>follies by which nations are fighting and destroying each other. I
</p>
<p>understood, in my letter to Bishop O'Connor, by the learned Priests
</p>
<p>in the first place Bishops, because learned Priests who apply their
</p>
<p>learning to support the usurpations and pretensions of the Pope, are
</p>
<p>used by him as Brshops or Inspectors of other Priests.
</p>
<p>Wherever I challenged Bishops and others to examine my Mes-
</p>
<p>sage of Peace and they refused to do so, the Spirit of darkness, by
</p>
<p>whom they are inspired, was made manifest in a similar manner as
</p>
<p>in the above copied letter of Bishop Michael O'Connor. He pro-
</p>
<p>ved to be a terrible infidel. I invited him with the clergy of his
</p>
<p>Diocese, and others to come and hear the reading of the Signs which
</p>
<p>happened according to Prophecies for the establishment of the pro-
</p>
<p>mised harmony and peace on earth. But instead of accepting my
</p>
<p>invitation to come and examine the argument of my assertion, he,
</p>
<p>without an examination of the matter, declared me to be an apostate
</p>
<p>and Heretic; but in the same connexion he confessed that he is of the
</p>
<p>Band of those who are Infidels. He confesses at the end of the let-
</p>
<p>ter that I reject those whom Christ had constituted to be his Legates;
</p>
<p>but at the commencement of the letter he tells, that many who call
</p>
<p>themselves Christ's Legates arelnfidels. Ideny that Christ had consti-
</p>
<p>tuted Popish Bishops to be his Legates. They are Infidels, as the
</p>
<p>Spirit by whom Bishop O'Connor was possessed while he was wri-
</p>
<p>ting the above copied letter was compelled to confess, and Bishop
</p>
<p>O'Connor was such a blind writing Medium of the Demon, that he
</p>
<p>was not aware what he was writing. Popish Bishops are Infidels,
</p>
<p>who call themselves Successors of the Apostles, which is the same
</p>
<p>as Christ's Apostles, or Christ's Legates, because a Successor of an
</p>
<p>Apostle is as certainly an Apostle, as a regal successor to a King is
</p>
<p>a King. And Bishop O'Connor asserts the same at the end of the
</p>
<p>copied letter, that Christ has constituted Popish Bishops to be his
</p>
<p>Legates. Legate in Latin means the same as Apostle in Greek.
</p>
<p>But Popish Bishops are laboring, not to establish Christ's Govern-
</p>
<p>ment or the great Republic of Truth and Righteousness, Harmony
</p>
<p>and Peace, but have been supporting, through a long course of cen-

</p>
<p>turies, and continue to support the most dreadful, warlike and des-
</p>
<p>potic monarchy, inspired and filled with all kinds of absurd errors
</p>
<p>and most abominable practices. After having crushed in Europe
</p>
<p>the Freeddm which nations should enjoy in Chrfst, they keep them
</p>
<p>in bondage by an enormous militia, who consume the produce of
</p>
<p>the laboring classes, to kill and to be killed, and they have rejected
</p>
<p>with such impertinence as their Representative shows in the copied
</p>
<p>letter, all my invitations to iearn the Message of Peace, and have
</p>
<p>prepared in'these LJnied States and vicinity as much fuel for fierce
</p>
<p>and fiery revolutions and wars as was in their power. Their pa-
</p>
<p>pers and books are filled with most arrogant boasting of their hav-
</p>
<p>ing the means for salvation which are not elsewhere, and the most
</p>
<p>abusive treatment of Heretics, that is, of those who know that they
</p>
<p>do not need the Pope and his Bishops as Mediums to come to Christ,
</p>
<p>C ,s J
</p>
<p>bul that these ministers of darkness are rather impediments than
</p>
<p>assistants in their cutting to Christ.
</p>
<p>While traveling -among the Indians, 1 found they were inspired
</p>
<p>by Popish Priests wiih an incredible hatred to Protestants, and they
</p>
<p>will be good instruments of the first bom sons and daughters of the
</p>
<p>Pope, that is, of Monarchs, to effect enormous destruction by sallies
</p>
<p>from woods upon those who will not be ready to defend themselves.
</p>
<p>The black Emperor of Hayti was crowned and inspired by Jesuits,
</p>
<p>to make as gr*at preparation as possible for fronting, to assist white
</p>
<p>Emperors and Kings in their conspiracy against ihe liberties of this
</p>
<p>country. And Santa Anna is assisted by crowds of Spanish sub-
</p>
<p>jects and other Europeans in converting Mexico into a land of sol-
</p>
<p>diers. I saw accounts in newspapers, before commencing to write
</p>
<p>this, of fifty thousand new soldiers in Mexico, large numbers of
</p>
<p>whom are Spanish subjects. The most Popish are the most war-
</p>
<p>like countries, that is, countries in which comparatively the greatest
</p>
<p>amount of life and property is destroyed. The Pope and his Bish-
</p>
<p>ops are preparing people for destruction, because they are laboring
</p>
<p>with great zeal to make all men and women on the whole earth to
</p>
<p>be their sheep. At length some begin to feel that they are not
</p>
<p>sheep, but men and women.; but others remain sheep of the Pope,
</p>
<p>and his first born sons and daughters, to whom they give their wool.
</p>
<p>They are employed as wild beasts to kill those who will not belong
</p>
<p>to the Pope's flock, and to be killed by them; because Bishops them-
</p>
<p>selves who pretend to be Pastors, are found to be Wolfs, i. e. wolves.
</p>
<p>Their representative is Anthony Aloysy Wolf, Prince Ijishnp of my
</p>
<p>native Diocese, Laibach. After this Wolf had in such manner de-
</p>
<p>ceived Ferdinand, Emperor of Austria, that he neglected to fulfil
</p>
<p>his high duly in regard to my Message of Peace, by the power of
</p>
<p>the Spirit, 1 compelled this Bishop Wolf to confess his conspiracy in
</p>
<p>a letter directed to me, which was published in the fourth of my
</p>
<p>before mentioned five volumes, and that letter occasioned the writing
</p>
<p>of three hundred pages, where many abominations of Bishops were
</p>
<p>made manifest, which without that letter would not have been dis-
</p>
<p>closed. Notwithstanding all the instructions and warnings given to

</p>
<p>Bishops, they remained obstinate sinners against the Holy Spirit;
</p>
<p>but after that I received no writing from any Bishop, except the
</p>
<p>above copied answer of Bishop O'Connor to my letter, which was
</p>
<p>occasioned by a Priest and Professor of Divinity in the Theological
</p>
<p>Institution at Birmingham, near Pittsburgh. The Professor affirm-
</p>
<p>ed, in a conversation with me, besides other absurdities, that Luther
</p>
<p>was a hog, because he married a Nun. I invited the Professor to a
</p>
<p>public discussion of the matter, whether it would not be better for
</p>
<p>Priests, Monks and Nuns to marry, than to continue in celibacy,
</p>
<p>and other matters which should be made known to Priests. He
</p>
<p>declined accepting my invitation.
</p>
<p>In Allegheny city I met with Professor Mosettitsch, a spy from
</p>
<p>the Austrian government. I was acquainted with that Priest during
</p>
<p>oar studies in the city of Laibach; then he was Professor of Divia-
</p>
<p>[wJ
</p>
<p>rty in Goricia, while I was Professor in Clagenfurt; but fre was o1R~
</p>
<p>dating as Parson in Allegheny city, and as Vicar General of Bishop
</p>
<p>O'Connor, and in these offices he bad good opportunity to> find out
</p>
<p>many secrets useful for hit. government. When i found in my con-
</p>
<p>versations with him thai he was an obstinate sinner against the-
</p>
<p>Holy Spir>t, L used him as my letter carrier to Bishop O'Connor.
</p>
<p>But when he brought me no answer, though 1 wrote the Bis-hop that
</p>
<p>he should either directly return my letter or send an answer, I tker
</p>
<p>wrote a second letter, and sent it by a citizen of Pittsburgh to Bish-
</p>
<p>op O'Connor, and required that he should either directly send rairwii
</p>
<p>answer or reiurn both letters. Then he wrote as above eopied, tefl
</p>
<p>which it is manifest that he belongs to the Band of those men who*
</p>
<p>are named by Jesus Christ, Wolves. Those wolves have roused n<H
</p>
<p>only those nations by whom the United Slates are surrounded to a
</p>
<p>warlike spirit, to kill and to be killed for the advantage of the Po-
</p>
<p>pish Dominion, but they have also gained in the United States
</p>
<p>lions of men for the same ab jminable purposes; and powerful bodres-
</p>
<p>which seem not to be Popish, have inherited the Popish Spirit and
</p>
<p>exercise it against the liberties of this country. For instance, Mor-
</p>
<p>monism is nothing else but Popery in a new Protestant form, and
</p>
<p>the government of Utah Territory is secretly inimical to the gor-
</p>
<p>eminent of the United Sta{es. But its secret hatred will become
</p>
<p>manifest, and I wish that it might become known before it may be
</p>
<p>too late to make use of our Solemn Warning.
</p>
<p>1 did not find much of that kind of republican spirit by which ci-
</p>
<p>tizens of the United States must be inspired and roused to action if
</p>
<p>they would escape the yoke of Monarchs, while I w.as traveling in
</p>
<p>more than twenty of the United Slates, peeking assistance against
</p>
<p>-the usurpations of the Pope of Rome and other Monarchs; but ail
</p>
<p>kind of Humbugs, preparatory to the subjugation of this Country
</p>
<p>by the Pope and his first born Sons and Daughters, received great
</p>
<p>support, while I was left without assistance.
</p>
<p>Were I to write volumes instead of a Circular, I would disclose
</p>
<p>unexpected things in reference to this point; but I only mention that
</p>
<p>after having endeavored to move Bishop O'Connor to examine my

<p>Message of Peace, I applied in several cities to such Protestant Cler-
</p>
<p>gymen as orofess to bu Latin scholars, to .furnish me a place for
</p>
<p>holding a Convention for examining my Latin Manuscript, and to
</p>
<p>publish my invitation, which would draw Roman Catholic Bishops
</p>
<p>and Priests to ourConvention, else they must continue to appear be-
</p>
<p>fore their own sheep as manifest enemies of God and Man. But I
</p>
<p>could not succeed in moving them to render assistance in this most
</p>
<p>important and just cause; because they are either igoorantly or wit-
</p>
<p>tingly supporting the government of the Pope^in this Country. At
</p>
<p>length I hired the American Hall, in the city of New York, pub-
</p>
<p>lished in an English Circular the appointment of a Latin Conven-
</p>
<p>tion, sent the Circular and a long Latin letter to the Archbishop of
</p>
<p>Baltimore, exhorting him to come with other Bishops aid Priests to
</p>
<p>ourConvention on the 16th of May, 1S40.
</p>
<p>[ 14 ]
</p>
<p>In the letter to iht* Archbishop of Baltimore, I quoted a large por-
</p>
<p>tion of the above copied letter of Bishop O'Connor, showing that it
</p>
<p>was written in a Demoniac State, and how Bishops and Priests should
</p>
<p>relieve themselves from being blind instruments of malicious De-
</p>
<p>mons, by coming to the appointed convention with a sincere desire
</p>
<p>to find out truth, and to examine freely, without prejudice, the Cre-
</p>
<p>dentials of my mission which is the mission of every true Christian.
</p>
<p>And in the first place Bishops and Priests should not be obstinate
</p>
<p>Infidels, but carefully examine the long chain of Signs according to
</p>
<p>prophecies, which will be shown in the Convention; Signs worthy
</p>
<p>of the glorious mission which we have received to establish Christ's
</p>
<p>peaceable Reign on Earth; because the time has arrived, according to
</p>
<p>prophecies, when the great promise of Harmony and Peace on
</p>
<p>earth will be accomplished by the instrumentality of true Christians
</p>
<p>in this Age. But to restore a lame Do& to health, (referring to what
</p>
<p>is said by Bishop d'Connor in the above copied letter,) is not befit-
</p>
<p>ting our mission; but it would be more suitable for Popish Bishops
</p>
<p>than to transubs antiale wafers into their Christs, and to give the
</p>
<p>eame power to others when ordaining them to be Priests.
</p>
<p>I did all I could to move the Archbishop of Baltimore and the
</p>
<p>whole Synod, to send most able Theologians to our Convention; but
</p>
<p>ihey rather preferred to be Governors in this Country, as appointed
</p>
<p>by their Lord and Monarch, the Pope, than to be true christians. A
</p>
<p>Popish Bishop in this country is nothing else but a Governor, receiv-
</p>
<p>ing power and jurisdiction from the Pope. Every Popish Bishop
</p>
<p>in this country exercises as much jurisdiction, so far as his power
</p>
<p>extends, and applies all his influence for the subjugation of the
</p>
<p>whole earth to be under control of the Pope, who claims to be the
</p>
<p>infallible Monarch of the Ohurch, and that to be saved it is necessa-
</p>
<p>ry that all should unite with his Church.
</p>
<p>The Archbishop and his Bishops were not yet ready to come to my
</p>
<p>Latin Convention, and learn to know their dreadful delusion and be
</p>
<p>true Christians, and Christ's Legates, co-operating with us for Christ's
</p>
<p>peaceable Reign. Nor would other Latin scholars attend that Con*
</p>
<p>vention which had been appointed, to be conducted in the Latin Ian*

<p>guage, on the 15th May, 1849, in the American Hall of New York,
</p>
<p>although they were most urgently invited in my Circular to come
</p>
<p>and learn how to sustain the true republican principle and spread it
</p>
<p>over the whole earth. Latin scholars receive greater advantages
</p>
<p>from Popes, Kings and Q,ueens than from republicans. Therefore
</p>
<p>I then translated my Latin Manuscript into German and English,
</p>
<p>endeavoring to assemble people to Conventions in those languages.
</p>
<p>But Papal Imperial Royal Agents, with whom this country is abun-
</p>
<p>dantly supplied, knowing the danger intended as to their Master's
</p>
<p>cause from our conventions, deluded the people, and frustrated my.
</p>
<p>attempts in such manner that I only succeeded, in the year 1851,
</p>
<p>in holding a small English Convention, in which thirteen Resolutions,
</p>
<p>to commence the New Era of'Harmony and Peace, commonly caU
</p>
<p>lod the Millenium, were unanimously adopted, and then published,
</p>
<p>C3
</p>
<p>^vrth other things showing in what manner people are magnetized"
</p>
<p>by Priests, firmly to believe, besides many mother incredible things,
</p>
<p>that also which Bishops in the Council of Trent decreed according
</p>
<p>to the wishes of their Master, the Pope,in Session ]:)th, Canon 1st,
</p>
<p>to wit: "If any body denies that there is in the Holy Sacrament of
</p>
<p>the Altar the body and the blood, the soul and the Deity of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ, and consequently the whole Jesus Christ truly, in reality
</p>
<p>and essence, let him be Anathema or accursed."
</p>
<p>According to the Council of Popish Bishops, all men are accur-
</p>
<p>sed and eternally damned, who do not belteve this and other articles
</p>
<p>of their faith. The Sacrament of the Altar is made of the wafer,
</p>
<p>or piece of bread, with the power of the Priest, when he speaks
</p>
<p>these words in his Mass: "Hoc est Corpus meum:" "This is my
</p>
<p>Body." This Sacrament is in every wafer which is transubstantia-
</p>
<p>ted with the above quoted words by ihe Priest while he is saying-
</p>
<p>Mass, although thousands of these Masses are said every day, and;
</p>
<p>one Priest transubstantiates sometimes hundreds of wafers in one
</p>
<p>Mass to supply all customers who are desirous to receive the Sacra-
</p>
<p>ment, that is, to receive the whole Jesus Christ, who, according to
</p>
<p>the Popish doctrine, is in each transubstantiated wafer; and if one
</p>
<p>wafer is broken into many pieces, each transubstantiated piece con-
</p>
<p>tains the whole Jesus Christ, that is, according to our apprehension,
</p>
<p>one Jesus Christ is multiplied into as many Jesus Christs as Priests
</p>
<p>are pleased to make.
</p>
<p>In the same pamphlet in which the above mentioned thirteen Res-
</p>
<p>olutions appeared, I published a Lecture on the dreadful abuse of
</p>
<p>Human Magnetism in the Mysteries of the Roman Church, by
</p>
<p>which readers were enabled to comprehend how Popish Bishop*
</p>
<p>and Priests could gather immense riches by their masses and multi-
</p>
<p>plications of their Christs. But the anti-christian powers soon
</p>
<p>made the copies of my pamphlet disappear, because it is extremely
</p>
<p>dangerous to their machinations, by which they are subjugating this
</p>
<p>country before people are aware of it.
</p>
<p>They also know how to control editors, that facts which cannot be
</p>
<p>kept secret any longer, are misrepresented in newspapers. I could

<p>fill volumes with instances of this kind; but in this Circular I shall
</p>
<p>only mention one. When it could no longer be kept secret that
</p>
<p>Papists in this republic were preparing weapons of war, then the
</p>
<p>following version of the fact appeared in Protestant newspapers. I
</p>
<p>quote from the Monthly Jubilee lor August, 1853. In that paper
</p>
<p>we read as follows: *
</p>
<p>44 We quote from the Democratic Review the significant an-
</p>
<p>nouncement that the Irish refugees are organizing a power for th
</p>
<p>deliverance of their fellow sufferers. They avow the intention to
</p>
<p>avail themselves of the first opportunity which shall present itself.
</p>
<p>We quote the Reviews
</p>
<p>'There is a spirit abroad among this mass of our citizens, which
</p>
<p>ha lately been aroused to a degree of resolution that must lead to %
</p>
<p>saccessfal issue in due course of time. This spirit is rapidly ex-
</p>
<p>landing to <:very town, city and village, and the alacrity with which
</p>
<p>* progresses shows a degree of earnestness which has been made
</p>
<p>the subject of much comment by many leadi-njr friends cf Ireland
</p>
<p>At present sojourning: in America. The spirit of military organiza-
</p>
<p>tion cannot have escaped the notice of cor citizens within the last
</p>
<p>few years, particularly since the Irish * failure' of 18-18. There are
</p>
<p>many of the bone and sinew of Ireland here, who would fight, and
</p>
<p>they thirst for another blow atvEngland. It is in contemplation, we
</p>
<p>are assured, to raise from sixty to one hundred thousand fighting
</p>
<p>men in these United States, fully armed, drilled and discip/ined, to
</p>
<p>be ready at some future day to rescue their native land.'*
</p>
<p>Not long since, I read the prospectus of a new Irish paper to be
</p>
<p>issued in Boston, containinof the f -Hewing remarkable confession :
</p>
<p>** We shall endeavor to extend military operations until every Irish-
</p>
<p>raan capable of bearing arms, is enrolled in some military associa-
</p>
<p>tion !*
</p>
<p>You will be deceived so lone as yen are net ready to hear truth,
</p>
<p>although it may not be pleasing when it shows how you have been
</p>
<p>deluded for many years, by the conspiracy acainst the liberties to
</p>
<p>which you are entitled in Jesus Chiist. You will never be weii in-
</p>
<p>structed concerning the number of emigrants coming from countries
</p>
<p>deroted to the PopoJ if you depend upon Almanr.cs snd the more
</p>
<p>popular class of newspapers. Only in one paper I read, that in the
</p>
<p>year I&4S about one m:U:on of persons cros:ed the Atlantic Ocean
</p>
<p>front Irefand, a large number of them to Canada and fr< m thence
</p>
<p>to the Western States. From what I have seen and heard from
</p>
<p>those who must know better than many ethers, as to the increase of
</p>
<p>Roman Catholics in the;r own section? of the United Stales. I found
</p>
<p>the statement of an observer cf the movt men's in Iceland much more
</p>
<p>eiact, than statements of these who reported a lower nu.nl er. And
</p>
<p>m regard to the intention cf their military movements, it should be
</p>
<p>known everywhere that the true Pep:sh spirit considers heretics, cr
</p>
<p>Protestants, as Rebels against their Monarch, the Pope. They are
</p>
<p>tolerated only so long as it wDuid hurt tie interests cf the Pope, if
</p>
<p>he should proclaim a crusade against them. And the great riches

</p>
<p>which are in the United States, are strong aiurements for daring en-
</p>
<p>terprises. The true Popish spirit, made manifest in bulls and other
</p>
<p>Popish documents, is the spirit of extermination cf Heretics .And
</p>
<p>yon will rind the same spint in the above copied letter of Bishop
</p>
<p>O'Connor. Those who arrogant ?y and boidiy refuse to examine the
</p>
<p>arguments against their pretensions snd usurpations, would certain-
</p>
<p>ly apply force to secure their usurpations and g-aiify their ambitmn,
</p>
<p>if they should feel themselves sir n^ en ur.h 10 crush their opposers.
</p>
<p>To know their power, it is to re understood that many Protectants
</p>
<p>arc secret Papists, under the Protestant mask rendering greater ser-
</p>
<p>rice to the Pope than they could do if they were rpen'y Papists.
</p>
<p>Bom. after Queen Victoria's marriage, I heard from several Roman
</p>
<p>[ IT]
</p>
<p>Catholics, who sefmed to be instructed in the matter, that she, too,
</p>
<p>is a secret Roman Catholic, and that she would be such openly if
</p>
<p>the law only allowed this to the Queen. Then I observed her steps,
</p>
<p>and believed the report.
</p>
<p>I read a sermon preached by Father Matthew in Ireland, several
</p>
<p>years before his call to this country. He is a Capuchin Monk, and
</p>
<p>Capuchin Monks are great and blind instruments of the Pope of
</p>
<p>Rome. In that sermon, notes of which were taken by one of his
</p>
<p>admirers, while he was preaching, and then it was published in this
</p>
<p>country, Father Matthew assured his countrymen that none of them
</p>
<p>need emigrate to America, that ^during the week preceding he had
</p>
<p>traveled through millions of acres of the best land in Ireland, not
</p>
<p>yet cultivated by any person, and that Irishmen could make as
</p>
<p>good a living in their own country as in / merica. When Father
</p>
<p>Matthew was preaching in that style, he did not yet know the se-
</p>
<p>cret design of Monarchs and their servants against the liberties of
</p>
<p>this cou ury. But having been let into this secret, he done all ia
</p>
<p>his power to promote the emigration of Irish people to this country,
</p>
<p>and to make citizens of the United States favorable to the enterpri-
</p>
<p>ses of his Lord, the Pope of Rome. In commendation of this in-
</p>
<p>strument of Monarchs, and the promotion of the cause headvocatedj
</p>
<p>Protestant Editors used much space in their newspapers. It would
</p>
<p>be but a poor excuse if they should say it was the temperance cause
</p>
<p>which they patronized, because Popish agents always come under
</p>
<p>pretext of reformation, to seduce and enslave so many as they may
</p>
<p>be able to move, and this, too, when not aware that they are enchain-
</p>
<p>ed. So powerful and successful was Father Matthew that editors
</p>
<p>to whom I offered articles showing his proper position, as also of
</p>
<p>other Popish agents, they dared not publish them. Such Editors
</p>
<p>keep people in darkness concerning the one thing needful, fillirfg
</p>
<p>their columns with all kinds of trashy and delusive aflairs. For
</p>
<p>the present, vague speculations and lengthy reports of the war'be-
</p>
<p>tween Russia and Turkey fill their columns.
</p>
<p>i After this manner ihe minds of most men are directed to those
</p>
<p>places where human life and property are in process of destruction,

<p>whilst few orally, or through the more popular papers of the day,
</p>
<p>have moral courage to instruct, direct and exhort people that they
</p>
<p>should mourn. . Whilst many hearing and reading of such dreadful
</p>
<p>things, testifyingvthe greatest possible degradation of our race, how
</p>
<p>few are attempting to do that which is most necessary to be done,
</p>
<p>to avert similar calamities from this country? The present destruc-
</p>
<p>tive scenes occurring in Europe are precursors of unexpectedly
</p>
<p>dreadful calamities in this country. Monarchs of Christian name
</p>
<p>will not be conquered by the Turks, no matter how great the assis-
</p>
<p>tance which may be afforded them by those who are trying tochange
</p>
<p>European Monarchies into Republics. But the Monarchs have
</p>
<p>plenty of arms, provisions, armies, and vessels of war, which, with
</p>
<p>the assistance of their almost innumerable friends in America, makes
</p>
<p>them feel confident that they are equal to begin so great a butchery *
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>C i3
</p>
<p>a$ may be necessary to convert this Republic into Monarchies. And
</p>
<p>they have'great reason to expect that very soon opportunity will
</p>
<p>occur to fight, and to fight with success, if the people of this coun-
</p>
<p>try have not knowledge of better weapons, and the right manner of
</p>
<p>using them against their power, than artillery, powder and bullets,
</p>
<p>swords of iron, rifle guns and other weapons of war.
</p>
<p>"Religious Liberty, in the sense of liberty possessed by every
</p>
<p>man to choose his religion, is one of the most wicked delusions ever
</p>
<p>foisted upon this age by the Father of all Deceit;" this is their prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, expressed in their newspapers, in their Bullarium Romanitm,
</p>
<p>and other works containing the Popish Imperial Royal Canon-Law,
</p>
<p>which shows the determination of the Pope and his Bishops and
</p>
<p>Monks to crush down, not only all religious, but also all political'
</p>
<p>liberty in the whole earth. They know that it is impossible for
</p>
<p>them to rule in security so long as this Republic exists. Therefore
</p>
<p>they have been preparing, secretly, weapons of war in this country,
</p>
<p>till at length the fact cannot be kept any longer secret. Howevrer,
</p>
<p>they have numerous Protestant papers, the editors of which give
</p>
<p>such a version of this affair that Protestants are as little alarmed as
</p>
<p>those were to whom Noah was preaching repentance and prophesy-
</p>
<p>ing the near approaching deluge; but they would not believe, and
</p>
<p>consequently perished. Papists, who are-the same as Monarchists^
</p>
<p>are expecting the near approach of their victory against Republi-
</p>
<p>cans in the United States. Whether they are right or wrong de-
</p>
<p>pends on you, my fellow-citizens and fellow-christians. If you take
</p>
<p>the right position and the right steps, making use of the right weap-
</p>
<p>ons, all Monarchs of this world cannot prevail against you. But if
</p>
<p>you take a wrong position and wrong weapons, you will suffer de-
</p>
<p>feat, till you correct your mistakes.
</p>
<p>Just as I am revising this sheet, in hopes that I shall at length find
</p>
<p>one who will publish it, I see an article, dated New York, Novem-
</p>
<p>ber 29, reporting a very great excitement on the arrival of the Irish
</p>
<p>refugee, Mitchell. Salutes were fired by the Irish military compa-
</p>
<p>nies, and other manifestations of the greatest enthusiasm took place.
</p>
<p>Meagher, Col. Doheny, and others, were among the earliest to greet

</p>
<p>Mitchell.
</p>
<p>Tlie latter part of the 17th chapter of Revelations continues to
</p>
<p>be fulfilled in this age. In the 16th verse, Monarchs appear as ex-
</p>
<p>ecutioners of judgments against the Harlot, or Church apostatized
</p>
<p>from the principles of Truth and Righteousness. Those who be-
</p>
<p>long to that Harlot, trust in the arms of the Prince of this world,
</p>
<p>and expect they will subjugate Monarchs by revolutions and wars,
</p>
<p>not knowing the prophecy, according to which it is evident that in
</p>
<p>this manner they will be made naked by Monarchs, that is, depri-
</p>
<p>ved of their property and consumed and burnt with fire. But my
</p>
<p>mission is to show how to make use of the weapons of the Lamb in
</p>
<p>the 14th verse of the 17th chapter of Revelations, to prevail, against
</p>
<p>the Beast and its Horns, against Popery, Monarchy and all kinds
</p>
<p>of Tyranny. ,
</p>
<p>On the 29th of November, 1853, that is, on my birth-day, thera
</p>
<p>seemed to be such an enthusiasm in the city of New York on th>
</p>
<p>arriva-L of a new and great Irish Refugee, i. e., a Great Minister of
</p>
<p>the Harlot of the 17th chapter of Revelations, to prepare l\er for
</p>
<p>destruction, as there was at the arrival of Louis Kossuth and his
</p>
<p>suite. Kossuth is my countryman, of the same Slavonian nation,
</p>
<p>and of the same government; his name is properly Koshuta, which
</p>
<p>means a Deer, an .animal most persecuted by hunters, and he, as
</p>
<p>Grand Master of the Harlot, which according to the 16th verse of
</p>
<p>the 17th chapter of Revelations, must be made by Horns, Mpnarchs .
</p>
<p>or Hunters, naked and desolate, and De burnt with fire, he deserved
</p>
<p>mystical names, farther explanation of which cannot be given in this
</p>
<p>small pamphlet, in which many things can only be hinted at. But
</p>
<p>after he and his companions had destroyed a large proportion of the
</p>
<p>people of my nation, and had come as refugees to America, I wrote
</p>
<p>to him while he was in New York, to deliver him from the womb of
</p>
<p>the Harlot: Rev. xvn;16, and to prepare him for the warfare which
</p>
<p>is directed by the Lamb, and waged by those who are called and
</p>
<p>chosen, and faithful: Rev. xvii:14. Then I wrote him again to
</p>
<p>Pittsburgh and informed him that I would meet him in Cincinnati.
</p>
<p>On his arrival in Cincinnati 1 gave him in writing so much infor-
</p>
<p>mation as was abundantly sufficient to move him to appoint a pri-
</p>
<p>vate conversation with me. But he was so cunning that he recei-
</p>
<p>ved me in a public audience, and excused himself with not having
</p>
<p>time to converse with me, and directed that I should apply to Count
</p>
<p>Pulsky.
</p>
<p>Ift the year 1844, a Hungarian Nobleman who, in America, for
</p>
<p>several months, had studied my publications and comprehending
</p>
<p>my Message of Peace, he was sent by me to the Imperial Court of
</p>
<p>Vienna and to Hungary, to instruct the leading men how to co-op-
</p>
<p>erate in a peaceable mariner for the fulfilment of the great promises.
</p>
<p>It would have been too difficult for Koshuta and his suite to answer
</p>
<p>a number of inquiries in connexion with the great questionWhy
</p>
<p>they used such weapons (Rev. xvn:16,) to destroy the Harlot by
</p>
<p>the Ten Horns, instead of using the weapons of the Lamb, (Rev.
</p>
<p>xvu:14,) to convert her to be Christ's Bride? Rev. xix:7. It was

</p>
<p>best for him to send me to his Minister, Pulsky, and this man ex-
</p>
<p>cused himself as not having been in Hungary at the time when my
</p>
<p>messenger arrived there. And since it would have been in vain if
</p>
<p>I had complained against the enormous destruction of human life
</p>
<p>and property during the dreadful revolution and war, on account
</p>
<p>that they despised to study my Message of Peace, and to make the
</p>
<p>application.of the means prepared in my publications and my man-
</p>
<p>uscripts, to destroy the Beast with ten Horns and the Harlot or
</p>
<p>Whore, without killing a man. But since they have accomplished
</p>
<p>just the contrary of what should have, been done to prevent repeti-
</p>
<p>tion of like destructions, I demanded from Count Pulsky to move
</p>
<p>Kossuth to retire with his suite into a suitable place to examine my
</p>
<p>publications and manuscripts, and thus learn how to work, not for
</p>
<p>can* . *
</p>
<p>destruction, but for Harmony and Peace of nations. But after sev-
</p>
<p>eral conversations with Pfclsky, he. at last brought the ultimatum of
</p>
<p>Kossuth that it was impossible for him to change his plans; because
</p>
<p>he is not preparing peace, but destruction of nations; and since be
</p>
<p>has rejected my advice, he contributed his share to the present war
</p>
<p>between Russia and Turkey.
</p>
<p>Not to write a volume of solemn warnings, instead of a small pam-
</p>
<p>phlet, I will only.^ive some instances, showing how my Lord, the
</p>
<p>Lamb, (Rev. xvii:J4,) will dethrone those who receive not our Mes-
</p>
<p>sage of Peace, when the peopj^ are prepared to receive it.
</p>
<p>In the year 1838, after the publication of the first of the five Ger-
</p>
<p>man volumes mentioned in this pamphlet, copies of it were sent to
</p>
<p>Ferdinand, Emperor of Austria, whom I exhorted, in a let'.er, most
</p>
<p>energetically to enjoin on his best Theologians the examination of
</p>
<p>my Message of Peace, and to send the result of their examination
</p>
<p>to be published with my remarks, to enable people to judge for
</p>
<p>themselves correctly concerning Ihese matters. But I received no
</p>
<p>answer. Then I published my second volume and sent a box filled
</p>
<p>with copies of both volumes to Matthew Raunicher, Bishop of Trieste
</p>
<p>directing him in a letter to send copies to the government, and to
</p>
<p>proceed in such manner that my volumes might be examined by
</p>
<p>Theologians, and the result transmitted to me, to be published with
</p>
<p>my remarks. I wrote for the same purpose to Doctor Joseph Pletz,
</p>
<p>Imperial Royal Director of Theological Studies, Parson of the Im-
</p>
<p>perial Court in Vienna, &c; to Anthony Aloysy Wolf, Prince Bish-
</p>
<p>op of Laibach, and to a number of others, but I received no answer,
</p>
<p>excepting from a Professor, who made a journey from my country
</p>
<p>to London and wrote me from that city, declaring that it would be
</p>
<p>very dangerous to write me from any place under the Austrian gov-
</p>
<p>ernment.
</p>
<p>After that I published the third volume, and sent a box contain*
</p>
<p>ing copies of the three volumes to the King of Bavaria, exhorting
</p>
<p>him in a letter, that the Emperor of Austria having been deceived
</p>
<p>by his false prophets, and had failed to perform his highest duty,
</p>
<p>that he, the King of Bavaria, should fulfill what the Emperor had

</p>
<p>failed to do, and recommend to his Theologians the examination of
</p>
<p>my publications, and then convert the other Monarchy. About the
</p>
<p>same time, to wit, the end of April, 1840, I also sent a copy of all
</p>
<p>three volumes to the King of France, exhorting him to translate and
</p>
<p>publish them in French, <hat the French nation might be among the
</p>
<p>first in proclaiming the glorious Message for the introduction and es-
</p>
<p>tablishment of Harmony and Peace of and among the nations. The
</p>
<p>Emperor of Austria, the King of Bavaria and the King of France
</p>
<p>were the only three among Monarchs to whom my first three vol*
</p>
<p>umes had been sent. Those volumes contained a complete view of
</p>
<p>that which should then have been spread among the nations as a
</p>
<p>preparation for the introduction of the promised New Era of Har-
</p>
<p>mony and Peace. I also wrote to a number of other Monarchs, in-
</p>
<p>forming them that I had sent copies of my publications, (the con*
</p>
<p>[91 J
</p>
<p>tents of which all Monarchs should know.) to the Emperor of Aus-
</p>
<p>/triaand the King of Bavaria; but alas! neither Monarchs nor people
</p>
<p>were ready to make use of the means for stopping destruction of
</p>
<p>*human life and property.
</p>
<p>Having received no answer from the Austrian government, a
</p>
<p>Messenger from the Heavenly Congress (Rev. xix:14) instructed
</p>
<p>me that Anthony Aloysy Wolf, Prince Bishop of Laibach, was the
</p>
<p>Prince of those who kept the Emperor and his subjects in darkness
</p>
<p>in regard to my publications, but that He was appointed to be given
</p>
<p>-as a warning example. Then I called two of the 114 witnesses
</p>
<p>who had been given me for assistance in what I performed in the
</p>
<p>Popish Church for \ testimony that her time was expiring. I read
</p>
<p>before them the letter which was prepared according to direction of
</p>
<p>the Heavenly Messenger, to compel B.shop WoJf to give me an an-

<p>swer, and said to them, You, as witnesses that this letter will be
</p>
<p>answered by Bishop Wolf, should do what follows, to wk: one of
</p>
<p>you seal the letter with mv seal, and the other will write the direc-
</p>
<p>tion as I shall dictate it. Then the lexter was committed to the care
</p>
<p>of my Invisible Directors, who, before that time, had given permis-
</p>
<p>sion to infernal executioners to punish with a sudden death Doctor
</p>
<p>Joseph Pleitz* Parson of the Emperor and Conspirator with Bishop
</p>
<p>Wolf to stop the circulation of my*volumes. But Prince Bishop
</p>
<p>Wolf was preserved to be a warning example for all Bishops. The
</p>
<p>spirit of Dr. Pletz was compelled by my Directors to make Bishop
</p>
<p>Wolf a writing medium to answer my letter, and to confess, not as
</p>
<p>a penitent, but as an obstinate sinner, his conspiracy and his great
</p>
<p>rebellion against Christ and the Eleavenly armies. Rev. xix.T4.
</p>
<p>When his letter was in transmission on the Ocean, infernal Demons
</p>
<p>were permitted to raise tremendous storms, in consequence of which
</p>
<p>iot only other vessels but also the steamer President perished in
</p>
<p>such manner that there was no vestige of her found. She perished
</p>
<p>;and President Harrison died at the same time; then Bishop Wolf's
</p>
<p>letter>arrived in America, and after a certain prophetical course thro'
</p>
<p>se-veral post-offices, it was handed me in Philadelphia, on the 19th
</p>
<p>oi April, 1841, that was, on the birth-day of the Emperor Ferdi-

<p>nand. I understood from this letter how rapacious Wolfs, or wolves
</p>
<p>fcad devoured the poor Emperor. Then I added "The One Thing
</p>
<p>Needful," as the 4th volume is entitled, the composition and print-
</p>
<p>ing-of which at the end, was almost 300 pages, of Memorable Events,
</p>
<p>referring to the conspiracy of rapacious Wolves against the liberty
</p>
<p>which nations should enjoy in Christ Jesus.
</p>
<p>Not to enter farther into explanation of matters, I only mention
</p>
<p>that in "The One Thing Needful," dreadful judgments, and the
</p>
<p>year in which they were to occur, 1848, have been prophesied in so
</p>
<p>wonderful a manner by the prophetical names and actions of the
</p>
<p>48th among the 144 witnesses, that I myself did not understand the
</p>
<p>prophecy, till in February, 1848, the European Revolutions broke
</p>
<p>out, which was the same month in which I appeared publicly, in
</p>
<p>th year 1888, as Christ's Legate, against the Abominable Deeds of
</p>
<p>Bishop* ^nd Priests, and declared my separation from, and inde-
</p>
<p>pendence of the Pope of Rome and his Bishops, In that Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion the three Monarchs to whom my volumes had been sent, were
</p>
<p>cast alive from their thrones by secret judgments; but nations, be-
</p>
<p>'Cause they were not yet prepared for better governments, and wem
</p>
<p>seeking Freedom with carnal weapons, received other Despots, j
</p>
<p>Whilst great Revolutions and dreadful Wars were consuming an
</p>
<p>enormous amount of human life and property in Europe, I wrote io
</p>
<p>President Polk towards the end of his Administration, because I
</p>
<p>did not find it convenient to disturb him while executing judgments
</p>
<p><m the Great Harlot in the war with .Mexico, according to the 16th
</p>
<p>verse of the 17th chapter of Revelations. In my letter I showed
</p>
<p>how he, with his friends, after the expiration of his Administrative
</p>
<p>term, might be much greater than any President of the United
</p>
<p>States ever was before him, if he would only publish and spread a
</p>
<p>work by the circulation of which the Monarchical influence would
</p>
<p>be destroyed in this country, arid the European Revolutions would
</p>
<p>have good results for the Liberty of Nations. However, Polk did
</p>
<p>not answer my letter but died about the same time in which rny
</p>
<p>work would have been published under his direction, if he had com-
</p>
<p>prehended the contents of my letter, and then he would have been
</p>
<p>Christ's Legate, instead of being- a dead man.
</p>
<p>When the Latin Convention, mentioned in this Pamphlet, had
</p>
<p>been appointed, I sent to the President, Zachary Taylor, a parcel,
</p>
<p>enclosed in which was a copy of my English Circular, containing
</p>
<p>the appointment, and a copy of my Latin Letter to the Archbishop
</p>
<p>of .Baltimore, and a Letter to the President, entreating him energet-
</p>
<p>ically, to fulfill his Highest Duty, and to send Latin Scholars to the
</p>
<p>appointed Convention, in which matters of the greatest importance
</p>
<p>for the Government of the United States would be disclosed, and to
</p>
<p>remember that he, as 12th President of the United States, should
</p>
<p>not be a Traitor to the cause of this Republic, as Judas was a trai-
</p>
<p>tor to the cause of Christ; but that he should be the Great Apostle
</p>
<p>of the. New Era, and the Great Instructor of Emperors and Kings
</p>
<p>for the Pacification of the World. The President did not under-
</p>
<p>stand my letter. No Latin Scholar appeared at the Latin Conven-

</p>
<p>tion, but men continued to slaughter each other with as much fury
</p>
<p>as if they had been ferocious beasts, and Monarchs overcame and
</p>
<p>crushed down all Revolutionary movements in Europe. Afterwards
</p>
<p>I wrote my last exhortation to President Taylor, showing him how
</p>
<p>he might correct so far as possible, what he had neglected to do
</p>
<p>respecting the Convention. But he remained obstinate, and died on
</p>
<p>the right day and hour in correspondence with what happened in
</p>
<p>other places, and according to what I was ordered to do at the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the same day, towards the end of which he expired,
</p>
<p>to be a warning example to all officers. But these matters cannot,
</p>
<p>be more fully explained in this small pamphlet, in which as many
</p>
<p>points as can be comprehended on a few pages, must be printed, that
</p>
<p>Presidential successors may be aroused, if ft be possible,'from their
</p>
<p>C S3 3
</p>
<p>hthargy, to do that which their predecessors neglected to perform,
</p>
<p>and this in order to save this Republic from the rapacious grasp of
</p>
<p>Monarchs.
</p>
<p>If President Fillmore had examined the writings which I sent
</p>
<p>him, and had he performed that which was shown him therein, he
</p>
<p>would have been the most important man in our time, and he could
</p>
<p>have effected the greatest things for the deliverance of Nations from
</p>
<p>the shackles of* Tyrants. He himself may report whether my lei-
</p>
<p>. ters were handed to him or remained in the hands of his Secretary,
</p>
<p>Webster. It certainly was his fault if he had such a Secretary a*
</p>
<p>would not hand him the most important documents. And because
</p>
<p>he despised the solemn warnings given him by my instrumentality,
</p>
<p>he began-just at the same time according to the prediction in my
</p>
<p>writings to him, to die politically, when his Secretary, Webster, also
</p>
<p>died physically. But Henry Clay died too, and also, in due timer
</p>
<p>the Wife of President Fillmore died at the expiration of his Admin-
</p>
<p>istration, before he left Washington City. All of which' happened
</p>
<p>according to our Prophetical Almanac, whereby we prophesy im-
</p>
<p>portant things.
</p>
<p>Yet it is not proper in this Pamphlet to explain Prophecies which
</p>
<p>will be more easily comprehended after reading my Manuscript in
</p>
<p>our Convention, and nothing would be more agreeable to me than
</p>
<p>that Ex-President Fillmore, with as many of his friends as he might
</p>
<p>be able to bring with him, should attend our Convention and co-op-
</p>
<p>erate with us for the resurrection not only of those who are Jiving
</p>
<p>in their corruptible bodies, but also of the departed, who are con-
</p>
<p>genial minds with him, and for the General Union of all Men in
</p>
<p>Christ's peaceable Reign.
</p>
<p>- In our Convention, not only this, but other things will also be made
</p>
<p>manifest, that those who study our Message of Peace with a sincere
</p>
<p>heart, their congenial departed friends also study it; because they
</p>
<p>perceive its reading and preaching through their friends who are
</p>
<p>living in their corruptible tenements. I notice this to arouse all
</p>
<p>those who read or hear this, not only for their own, but also for the
</p>
<p>happiness of their departed friends, to reflect deeply upon the con-

</p>
<p>tents of this Circular, and to do that which is recommended therein.
</p>
<p>Action is required for the deliverance of all men from bondage, for
</p>
<p>% the greater advantage of the Slave-holders, as well as those who are
</p>
<p>kept in bondage by them. An enormous amount of time and mon-
</p>
<p>ey has been squandered, and many people have been killed in the
</p>
<p>fighting caused by Slavery, without any amelioration in this matfer;
</p>
<p>also, by Anti-Slavery agitation an immense amount of fuel for the
</p>
<p>destruction of this Republic; but by our Message of Peace means
</p>
<p>will be shown by which Slave-holders themselves will acquire great
</p>
<p>'advantages, even temporally, by the manumission of their Slaves,
</p>
<p>and Slaves will acquire that Liberty to which every person has his
</p>
<p>right and claim under Christ's peaceable Reign.
</p>
<p>Whereas, a knowledge of the contents of the often-mentioned
</p>
<p>Manuscript is quite necessary to the officiating President, Franklin
</p>
<p>[*4]
</p>
<p>Pierce, and to the Congress, that every on* may be o his proper
</p>
<p>station, such as it should be in their present critical situation ani
</p>
<p>circumstances, it is necessary before mentioning my proposal, pub-
</p>
<p>licly, to remind the President that I sent him, on the first day of
</p>
<p>January, 1853, a printed Circular containing an invitation to aCon>
</p>
<p>vention. That Circular was enclosed in my short Letter, ra which
</p>
<p>he was exhorted to attend the Convention and learn how to remove
</p>
<p>a scourge from the country. If other business had, not prevented
</p>
<p>him from learning 10 know the worth of that New Year's Gift, the
</p>
<p>members of his Cabinet might have known at present that which
</p>
<p>they need most, and by his co-operation it would have been spread
</p>
<p>abroad. But neither the President elect, nor any other influential
</p>
<p>man had'time to reflect upon the cantents of my Circular, nor did
</p>
<p>they attend the Convention appointed in that Circular, nor did they
</p>
<p>move their friends to do this. But the tools of Monarchs had plen-
</p>
<p>ty of time to prevent the success of that Convention. ^ On this point
</p>
<p>we shall say no more, except that the President and his party need
</p>
<p>also strong Signs of instruction and exhortation, that at least they
</p>
<p>might now learn to understand their high calling, after matters have*
</p>
<p>become more mature.
</p>
<p>The great stroke on the 6th of January, on which day the Romiil*
</p>
<p>Church was celebrating her great Festivity of Manifestation, is in-
</p>
<p>close connexion with what I hove sent on the first of the same month*
</p>
<p>to the President elect, and has a deeper Prophetical meaning than?
</p>
<p>can be explained here. The death of the President's only son, who
</p>
<p>was suddenly taken away, at length should move his. father to pre*
</p>
<p>pare the resurrection fjr many. His o\yn life has been wonderfully
</p>
<p>saved that he might do this. The most influential Senator of the
</p>
<p>Democratic party was also instructed and exhorted at the right time,,
</p>
<p>by the death of his wife, to assist his wife, or his party, as fco resur^
</p>
<p>rection into the Reign of Peace. And Vice President King died on
</p>
<p>the 19th of April, on the birth-day of the Emperor Ferdinand, who
</p>
<p>was exhibted during my Proclamation of the Fall of Babylon, as-
</p>
<p>the Representative of Monarchs in my five volumes, published from?
</p>
<p>A. D. 1838 till 1842, and since that time every year on that day

</p>
<p>there have happened memorable events, by which we receive the
</p>
<p>assurance that in our age Great and Small Kings will disappear,and
</p>
<p>the World's Republic of Harmony and Peace will be established.
</p>
<p>And this is my anxious desire, that President Pierce might take our'
</p>
<p>Spiritual Sword and Pierce with it great and small Kings, and do
</p>
<p>all-in his power to stop destruction of human life and property.-^-
</p>
<p>But if he despises our Message of Peace, tnusiing in fragile weap-
</p>
<p>ons, great loss of human life w.N occur, and much property also will
</p>
<p>be destroyed, and large portions of this country will come into- the
</p>
<p>hands of Monarchs. Because, the longer that Members of theCah-*
</p>
<p>inet, Representatives in Congress, in Legislatures, in the various
</p>
<p>Offices of the United States, and of each State, and also the longer
</p>
<p>ail citizens of this Republic will delay to apply the right means,
</p>
<p>which are concentrated in my Manuscript, existing in three law*
</p>
<p>C 25 ]
</p>
<p>tnia^es, to convert Emperors and Kings, the Pope and his Bishops
</p>
<p>in to "true Republicans or true Christians, the greater will be the dis*
</p>
<p>Asters and evils inflicted upon you and your country. But if you
</p>
<p>attend Conventions to prepare to hold which in many places, will be
</p>
<p>shown, and if you will purify your hearts from selfish interests and
</p>
<p>be inspired with a sincere desire to know truth and act accordingly,
</p>
<p>and if you comprehend the contents of my Manuscript and spread
</p>
<p>them with the power of Christ's Spirit, I have great hope that you
</p>
<p>will convert the Pope, himself, and many other Monarchs, and large
</p>
<p>numbers of their Political and Ecclesiastical servants; because you
</p>
<p>may conclude from what I have hinted at in this Pamphlet as brief-
</p>
<p>ly as possible, that if you unite as true Christians, or what is the
</p>
<p>same, as true Republicans, and take the weapons to collect and con-
</p>
<p>centrate which I was Commissioned, according to Prophecies, th3
</p>
<p>Heavenly Armies, Rev. xix:I4, will be united with you, to give as-
</p>
<p>sistance to those who will endeavor to know Truth and act accord-
</p>
<p>ingly; otherwise to let Malicious Demons loose to make their fury
</p>
<p>manifest among those who refuse to receive our Message, and when
</p>
<p>some of them are destroyed in such a strange manner as they will
</p>
<p>effect it, others will more easily comprehend that it Was a warning
</p>
<p>example for them, then will many begin to receive our Message of
</p>
<p>Peace.
</p>
<p>This is written to awaken as many as possible from their lethargy,
</p>
<p>and especially those who exercise great influence over their fellow
</p>
<p>men, and have great opportunity to spread it at home as well as
</p>
<p>abroad; therefore I exhort the President and Congress of the United
</p>
<p>States to peruse this Circular, copies of which will be sent them so
</p>
<p>far as necessary, that they may comprehend it fully; because I hope
</p>
<p>that, notwithstanding they may find several points in it not concur-
</p>
<p>in^ with their prejudices,,that yet they will judge favorably of the
</p>
<p>i whole; particularly when they see and weigh the reasons and argu-
</p>
<p>ments which will be unfolded in the Jong chain to be exhibited in
</p>
<p>our Convention, to bind the Drrfgon, or the Spirit of Delusion, Rev-
</p>
<p>elations xx:l.

<p>communicate to Nations to establish true Freedom, Harmony and
</p>
<p>Peace of and for all, should be properly examined, and if sufficient-
</p>
<p>ly proved as true and beneficial to Mankind, that it shall be received
</p>
<p>and spread in the world. But if an^point or link in the chain sub-'
</p>
<p>mitted be found not strong enough to hold all other links of the
</p>
<p>chain together, let it be cast out, yet the remaining ones can be o
</p>
<p>Connected that the chain may be spread over the whole Globe, arift
</p>
<p>it will be sufficiently strong to bind the Dragon, or the Old Spirit of
</p>
<p>Delusion, and thus pacify the Living in their outward mortal body,
</p>
<p>as well as the Deceased. Since it is the principal duty of the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident and Congress of these United States to contribute for this pur-
</p>
<p>pose all that may be in their power, I expect they will find from this
</p>
<p>Pamphlet that it is their duty to encourage the appointment of a
</p>
<p>Convention, to be held in the City of Washington, as soon as possi-
</p>
<p>[ 26 ]
</p>
<p>bte after receipt and examination of this Pamphlet. The Conven-
</p>
<p>tion might be continued Jot one week, reading first the English
</p>
<p>translation of my Latin Manuscript. The reading should not be in-'
</p>
<p>terrupted by remark, nor by question, unless the meaning of a word
</p>
<p>or phrase should not be understood, and in this case I will be ready
</p>
<p>togive its explanation. Because in this Manuscript there is such a
</p>
<p>connexion of things and chain of events, that the whole must be
</p>
<p>exhibited to be fully understood. In this manner Natrons will be
</p>
<p>enatLd to examine the matter, judge about it, and thus learn how to1
</p>
<p>bind the Dragon, the Spirit of Delusion, or the Old Serpent, who
</p>
<p>has so long deceived the Nations. "The Wise Man examines be-
</p>
<p>fore he judges, but the Fool judges before be examines."
</p>
<p>Millions of Fools have judged about my Message, without having
</p>
<p>examined the links of the chain presented therein, tv dfscove? the"
</p>
<p>various links in their unique connection, and whether each link is
</p>
<p>Strong enough to keep the whole chain together. When the whole
</p>
<p>chain will be exhibited, or the whole Manuscript read in the Con-
</p>
<p>rention, then I demand that any person who may feel themselves
</p>
<p>able to refute either the whole or parts thereof, they shall do this it*
</p>
<p>writing. All that they may have to declare should be presented iiv
</p>
<p>one written instrument, proposed by those who have attended the
</p>
<p>reading in the Convention. The writing to be proposed by them in
</p>
<p>my presence and in presence of other witnesses, and signed by all
</p>
<p>concerned in the writing, that their celebrity as wise men may be
</p>
<p>perpetuated, if they have written as wise men, and as fools, if they
</p>
<p>have written as fools. 
</p>
<p>Then their writing, with the signatures of those who have writ-
</p>
<p>ten their objections and refutations, will be handed me as addenda to
</p>
<p>the Manuscript, with my replication, the whole to be published in
</p>
<p>the English language, as soon as means can be obtained. Also, to
</p>
<p>be published in Latin, to be sent to the Pope and other Bishops who
</p>
<p>do not understand English, and in German, and as many other lan-
</p>
<p>guages as may be necessary that Nations may judge for themselves
</p>
<p>about this matter; for I do most solemnly declare that in my Manu-
</p>
<p>script are exhibited the Credentials, showing and proving that I ap-

</p>
<p>pear according to Prophecies as Messenger of the Dispensation of
</p>
<p>the Fulness of Times, Ephs. 1:10, commonly called the Millennial
</p>
<p>Dispensation, and that all who understand these Credentials, who
</p>
<p>are united with me in Cjirist^ Spirit, and who Spread the glorious
</p>
<p>Message of Peace, are Christ's Messengers and acting in concert
</p>
<p>Tnritbme, for the fulfillment of the Great Promise of the Pacification
</p>
<p>of all Nations. Therefore, as Christ's Messenger, I demand that the
</p>
<p>President and Congress of the United States, on the receipt and care-
</p>
<p>ful study of this Pamphlet, shall call and appoin-t a Convention as
</p>
<p>soon as possible, and gather together the Bishops of the United
</p>
<p>States, particularly of those States which existed before the acquisi-*
</p>
<p>tion of Territory by the late war with Mexico. The reason is that
</p>
<p>precious time may not be lost by waiting to gather together thostf
</p>
<p>Bishops who reside at too great a distance; because the present is,
</p>
<p>[ 27 ]
</p>
<p>the most precious time for this country, that judgments now raging
</p>
<p>in Europe, so far as possible, may be prevented in this country, and
</p>
<p>that Messengers of Pacification may be sent from our Capitol to all
</p>
<p>Governments of the whole Earth.
</p>
<p>To effect this, I likewise demand that the President and Congress
</p>
<p>shall not only gather Roman Catholic Bishops, but also Ambassa-
</p>
<p>dors of all Foreign Nations sent to the Government of the United
</p>
<p>States, who reside in Washington City, inviting them to said Con-
</p>
<p>vention, and for this purpose, my Pamphlet should, without delay,
</p>
<p>be read in both Houses of Congress as the most necessary and pre-
</p>
<p>cious document, tending to save this Nation from approaching: and
</p>
<p>impending Judgments, and for the Pacification of the whole World.
</p>
<p>And that a copy of this Pamphlet should be printed and sent with
</p>
<p>the appointment of the Conventien and with the invitation to all
</p>
<p>Bishops of this Republic, and of Ambassadors from foreign Gov-
</p>
<p>ernments.
</p>
<p>The invitation to Bishops and Ambassadors should be made by
</p>
<p>the President and Congress, and the new edition of this Pamphlet
</p>
<p>should be sent directly to said Bishops and Ambassadors, that Bish-
</p>
<p>ops or others may prepare themselves to refute any point in my
</p>
<p>Manuscript on its being read in the Convention.
</p>
<p>Here I will give the contents of Five Sections of my Manuscript,
</p>
<p>written in Latin, English and German, the English translation of
</p>
<p>which will be read in the Convention. The place in Washington
</p>
<p>City, and time to be appointed by the President and Congress of
</p>
<p>the United States, and published, with a new edition of this Pam-
</p>
<p>phlet. And tnis Message of Truth, Justice and Peace, will be found
</p>
<p>of more importance than all the President's Messages that have ever
</p>
<p>been sent to Congress or submitted to the consideration of the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican people. And woe be to the President, Congress and people of
</p>
<p>this Republic, if it is not attended to, because it is a Message from
</p>
<p>the President of Presidents, and one that will tell upon mankind.

<p>archy, have received power from the Dragon, the Spirit of Delu-
</p>
<p>sion, or Old Serpent, who deceived, and deceiveth the Nations,keep-
</p>
<p>ing them in bondage, destroying them in wars, and by various other
</p>
<p>ways, until Nations shall have arrived aj maturity and the enjoy-
</p>
<p>ment of a truly Christian, Catholic and Republican Government,
</p>
<p>In this Section, which is introductory to the following Sections, in
</p>
<p>relation to matters which had been seen in part by my predecessors,
</p>
<p>and partly such matters as could not have been 6een by them; be-
</p>
<p>cause they had not yet received the key, to unfold which is disclosed
</p>
<p>in the following Sections, and which afford light, and confirm the
</p>
<p>contents of the first Section. But things concerning the name of
</p>
<p>the Beast, Rev. xm:17.18, and how to count with the number 6^8,
</p>
<p>Rev. xiii:18, the Times of the Duration and Power of the Beast,
</p>
<p>concerning which all my forerunners were ignorant, (because I was
</p>
<p>[ 28 ]
</p>
<p>the first among men in their mortal bodies to whom the key wad-
</p>
<p>gjven to unlock these things, which are explained in 3d and 4th Sec-
</p>
<p>tions of the Manuscript, after explanation of what is necessary con-
</p>
<p>cerning the 144 witnesses, amongst whom the 90th has brought the
</p>
<p>number of the name of the Beast, and the 100th the Image of the
</p>
<p>Beast into our Catalogue, referring to the great excommunication
</p>
<p>which had been predicted by many Prophets.
</p>
<p>Sec. II. The Beast re-appeared from the Abyss, or Pit of the
</p>
<p>Deep, according to the 8th verse of the 17th chapter of Revelations,
</p>
<p>when Pope Pius VII, after the destruction of ^Napoleon's Empire,
</p>
<p>returned from French captivity, retaking the Papal Territory, and
</p>
<p>commencing to rule again as an independent Monarch.
</p>
<p>Sec. III. The Angei, which means Messenger, spoken of in the
</p>
<p>first three verses of the 18th chapter of Revelations, was a HoJy -
</p>
<p>Martyr of the One Hundred and Forty-Four Thousand spoken of
</p>
<p>in Rev. xiv:l, who was found worthy the charge, to prepare for the
</p>
<p>fulfillment of the contents of said three verses. This Anpel. or
</p>
<p>Messenger, (whose name and ministry, while in his mortal body,
</p>
<p>are explained in this Section,) at the proper season appointed
</p>
<p>in Prophecies for proclamation of the Dispensation of the Fulness
</p>
<p>of Times, Ephs. 1:10, found that Iwas prepared and ready, under
</p>
<p>his direction, to perform what was required according to Prophecies,
</p>
<p>to be performed in the Roman Catholic Church, as a preparation for
</p>
<p>the proclamation of the contents of the three first verses of the 18th
</p>
<p>chapter of Revelations, and for the*proclamation itself, for a testi-
</p>
<p>mony to Bishops and all others, that^the Popish Administration was
</p>
<p>to expire, and the promised New Era to commence. And this, so
</p>
<p>soon as a sufficient number of Christ's Messengers, or Christ's Le-
</p>
<p>gates, are awakened and understand the glorious News, and cause
</p>
<p>to resound through the desolate territories of Babylon, the Heaven-
</p>
<p>ly Voice, spoken of in Rev. xvm, verse 4th, and following* saying,
</p>
<p>"Come out from Babylon, partake not with her in her sins, that ye
</p>
<p>be not partakers of her plagues. ^
</p>
<p>This Holy Martyr was the Angel, or Minister, and my Leader/
</p>

</p>
<p>might be proclaimed, which was explained in my former publica-
</p>
<p>tions, as well as in the third Section of my Manuscript, in a manner
</p>
<p>trjrat sincere inquirers after truth are able to understand it. A long
</p>
<p>chain of Memorable Events preceding the proclamation and follow-
</p>
<p>ing it, are explained in trie third section, which is longer than the
</p>
<p>preceding ones taken together; and although the contents of Section
</p>
<p>third appear in this report to be very strange, they will no longer
</p>
<p>be strange when considered and understood in connection with all
</p>
<p>the events.
</p>
<p>Spirit Manifestations, during ,the last four or five years, have ap-
</p>
<p>peared very strange to many, but I tellyou they are not understood;
</p>
<p>nor will they be understood even by those who experience more or
</p>
<p>less of Spirit Influence, nor by those who, although they pro-
</p>
<p>fess to believe in Spirit Manifestations of the Bible, are offended
</p>
<p>[J
</p>
<p>when they bear of th-etn taking place. Their connection with what
</p>
<p>has been explained in my writings concerning Spirit Manifestations,
</p>
<p>from the times of the ancient Prophets and Apostles, through a Jong
</p>
<p>course of centuries, and my experience in this respect, during the
</p>
<p>disclosures of matters for the New Era, will shed much light on this
</p>
<p>point. And all this was and is necessary to prevent the shedding
</p>
<p>of blood, and to draw Nations into a state of Peace, Harmony,
</p>
<p>Righteousness and Truth.
</p>
<p>Sec. IV. Matters mentioned in the preceding Sections are confir-
</p>
<p>med by a long chain of Signs, in such manner that those only who
</p>
<p>are notable to examine (or themselves, and consider them in common,
</p>
<p>or who are pertinaciously obstinate sinners against the Holy Spirit,
</p>
<p>and as such, not ready to examine for themselves, will not be cn-
</p>
<p>vinced of the Truth of our fvlission for the abolition of Popery and
</p>
<p>introduction of the Reign oi Peace.
</p>
<p>Sec. V. There must be a Centre of Action and an Association,
</p>
<p>to begin practically to show how to make the Poor rich and the Rich
</p>
<p>happy, as it will take pluce in the Millennial Dispensation. In the
</p>
<p>existing order of things all classes suffer on account of the wrong
</p>
<p>relations and connections among men, and in this Babylon even the
</p>
<p>richest persons cannot enjoy that happiness which the man who ap-
</p>
<p>pears to be very poor will enjoy, when the right order of things is
</p>
<p>established, and all classes of persons co-operate for the welfare of
</p>
<p>every human being, then they will understand the above-mentioned
</p>
<p>points, in connection with many other things whieh are explained
</p>
<p>in' my Manuscript, the English translation of which is to be read in
</p>
<p>the Convention, which should be appointed by the President and
</p>
<p>Congress of the Uniied States as soon as possible, and in Conven-
</p>
<p>tions which will be spoken of at the end of this Pamphlet.
</p>
<p>The written volumes should convince the President and Con-
</p>
<p>gress that nothing ever was or ever can be more necessary and use-
</p>
<p>ful for the Nation and for them, than holding this Convention.
</p>
<p>No business is more pressing to be undertaken without delay than
</p>
<p>this. I hope that which has been presented in this Pamphlet will
</p>
<p>be sufficient to move the majority of the members of Congress to

</p>
<p>act for this purpose, and to represent their opponents in Congress
</p>
<p>as the greatest enemies of the Human, Race, notwithstanding they
</p>
<p>may appear, in the opinion of Fools, as great Benefactors.
</p>
<p>I know not what Gerrit Smith and other Anti-Slavery Champions
</p>
<p>will do in this cause. I have instructed and exhorted him person-
</p>
<p>ally and by letter, to examine my Message of Truth and Peace, then
</p>
<p>to co-operate with me for the Freedom of all Men, with consent and
</p>
<p>approbation of Congress, as well as of Slave-holders themselves.
</p>
<p>But the Blind Leaders of the Blind despised the voice of Christ,
</p>
<p>the Lord, which was made by his true Messengers, yet following
</p>
<p>the Spirit of Delusion, they have prepared fuel to kindle a dreadful
</p>
<p>fire for the ruin of this Republic. I found no more dangerous Sec-
</p>
<p>tarians than Anti-Slavery Ministers. It would be necessary to writ*
</p>
<p>volumes and explain how they and other leaders of Abolitionist*
</p>
<p>[SO ]
</p>
<p>have retarded the process of my Message of Peace, and either wit-
</p>
<p>tingly or ignorantly have supported trie cause of Monarchs against
</p>
<p>this Republic.
</p>
<p>How great the strength of Monarchs is in Canada, those persons
</p>
<p>may estimate who have traveled on loot in the interior and on the
</p>
<p>Lake shores of Canada several hundred miles, as I have done, and
</p>
<p>have also examined the numerous fortifications, for which only a
</p>
<p>Fool would apply many Millions of Pounds Sterling, suppose there
</p>
<p>were no intention to use them, at a convenient time, against this Re-
</p>
<p>public. Anti-Slavery people, instead of using our Message of Peace
</p>
<p>for the abolition of all kinds of Slavery, have labored to bring as
</p>
<p>many Slaves into Canada as they could, to be drilled there in the
</p>
<p>use of weapons of war, and in due time to kill citizens of the Uni-
</p>
<p>ted States, and be killed by them. It is not necessary to give many
</p>
<p>facts of their foolish proceedings, let one suffice.
</p>
<p>Being in Professor Stowe's house at different times, while he was
</p>
<p>Professor in Lane Seminary, near Cincinnati, striving to move him
</p>
<p>to examine my writings, then to take our position for Harmony and
</p>
<p>Peace of Nations. But he always refused. At length, instead of
</p>
<p>passing the house of his father-in-law, Professor Beecher, I stopped
</p>
<p>there with my trunk, and said 10 Prof. Beecher, in my trunk there
</p>
<p>are Manuscripts of great importance to Professors of Divinitythat
</p>
<p>he should call his son-in-law and the other Professor of Divinity, and
</p>
<p>then I would explain the matter to all three Professors together.
</p>
<p>When they came together, I assured them that besides other Man-
</p>
<p>uscripts, there was also one in my trunk written in Latin, English
</p>
<p>and German, to wit, the same spoken of in this Pamphlet, which
</p>
<p>they might read either in Latin or the English translation, on con-
</p>
<p>dition that if they should find any point therein which they thought
</p>
<p>they were able to refute, they should try to do so; but engaging
</p>
<p>them at the same time to co-operate with me in the promulgation
</p>
<p>and spreading of that which they might not find themselves able to
</p>
<p>gainsay.
</p>
<p>Although I insisted most strenuously, assuring them that it would
</p>
<p>be of the greatest importance and utility in promoting the Freedom

</p>
<p>and Peace of all nations, Prof. Stowe was opposed to my proposal,
</p>
<p>and his father-in-law and the other Professor followed his bad exam-
</p>
<p>ple, instead of preparing Nations on the right principle and man-
</p>
<p>ner for such Freedom as they would be able to enjoy. At length
</p>
<p>"Uncle Tom's Cabin" appeared, by Mrs. Stowe, wife of Professor
</p>
<p>Stowe, and daughter of Prof. Beecher, which was received, even
</p>
<p>in Europe, with such an enthusiasm as Monarchs and their servants
</p>
<p>were able to excite by spreading that Cabin in many European lan-
</p>
<p>guages; also in twenty Russian editions, to inspire with hatred all
</p>
<p>classes of people in Europe against the United States, and to show
</p>
<p>them that citizens of this Republic are notable to govern themselves,
</p>
<p>and consequently need Monarchical Governments. This is one of
</p>
<p>the many ways in which this idea is instilled, as much as possible,
</p>
<p>into the minds of the subjects of Monarchs. And Anti-Slave.ry
</p>
<p>[ 81 ]
</p>
<p>people, instead of preparing for" Peace, are preparing for desolating*
</p>
<p>Evolutions.
</p>
<p>While. I was traveling in more than twenty of these States, I also
</p>
<p>met with some Anti-Slavery people who were preparing for Insur-
</p>
<p>rections of Slaves, but I warned them that such steps would not only
</p>
<p>tend to destroy many Slaves, but ultimately would bring Slaves and
</p>
<p>Masters under the yoke of Monarchs, whereas by spreading our
</p>
<p>Message the Great Republic, or true Church-of Christ, would be
</p>
<p>established. But they were so brutalized, that instead of hearing
</p>
<p>my warnings, they answered: m Insurrections, tho' resulting in a
</p>
<p>Revolution, many Slaves would not be killed, for after they would
</p>
<p>set fire to the buildings of their Masters, they would take refuge in
</p>
<p>such places where they would be protected by Monarchists* I have
</p>
<p>given these hints that persons of all political parties in Congress
</p>
<p>may be moved to co-operate in holding a Convention without delay,
</p>
<p>thus preventing, as far as possible, the threatened destruction of life
</p>
<p>and property.
</p>
<p>Intending *o hold a Convention, preparatory to the one proposed
</p>
<p>to be held in Washington City, District of Columbia, I went to Mer-
</p>
<p>cer county, Pa., which seemed to be less subjugated by Popish Im-
</p>
<p>perial Royal Powers than other counties in Pennsylvania, consequent-
</p>
<p>ly most suitable for our purpose.
</p>
<p>Thither I went in October, 1853, delivering addresses in many
</p>
<p>places. On Sunday before noon, Nov. 13th, I preached in the Free
</p>
<p>Presbyterian Church; in the evening in the Methodist Church; and
</p>
<p>the Old School Presbyterian Minister and myself intimated my
</p>
<p>*Lecture on the Number of the Beast, 668, Rev. ximlS/1 to be de-
</p>
<p>livered on Monday, Nov. 14, at candie lighting, in the Old School
</p>
<p>Presbyterian Church. The meeting-house was crowded.
</p>
<p>Having finished my Lecture, on descending from the Pulpit to the
</p>
<p>stand, to obtain names of subscribers towards printing this Pamphlet,
</p>
<p>a case occurred which I feel it to be my duty to bring before the au-
</p>
<p>thorities, not only in self-defence, but also thereby to arouse the at-
</p>
<p>tention of the people to the matter.
</p>
<p>I first brought it before a Justice of the Peace in that place; but

</p>
<p>he said the matter belonged to the Court, the November term ox'
</p>
<p>which had commenced in Mercer on the same day. I therefore pre.
</p>
<p>sented the case in writing, with reasons showing why I felt it to be
</p>
<p>my duty to proceed in this manner. The case was presented by a
</p>
<p>Lawyer, praying the necessary steps to be taken in my case. But
</p>
<p>it seerried not to be sufficient to move the Judge. I then added two
</p>
<p>pages of extraordinary facts, .showing the justice of my demand,
</p>
<p>and that it was such a case as should be taken into consideration in
</p>
<p>any Court pretending to be a Court of Justice. But when nothing
</p>
<p>had been done in my behalf, I wrote an Illustration of what had hap-
</p>
<p>pened, referring to the contents of the sheets which had been writ-
</p>
<p>ten and presented to Court.
</p>
<p>I will give some extracts, omitting the name of the man implica-
</p>
<p>ted, who is American by birth, a Roman Catholic, or Papist, by pro-
</p>
<p>E 32 ]
</p>
<p>fession, and a blind worshipper of Bishop O'Connor. He spoke'
</p>
<p>aloud, that all could hear him in the Presbyterian Church, of Clarks-
</p>
<p>ville, Mercer county, Pa., as follows, with my remarks
</p>
<p>1, That what I said in the Lecture was a lie. 2. That I was an
</p>
<p>Impostor. 3. That I never was a Priest in the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>Church. And when, in reply, 1 remarked that I would read ar let-
</p>
<p>ter of Michael O'Connor, Bishop of Pittsburgh, writied in Latin by
</p>
<p>him to me, the text of which, and the English translation were then
</p>
<p>in my possession, he asserted .
</p>
<p>4. That Bishop O'Connor had never written a letter to me;
</p>
<p>While I affirmed that he had so written, and that I had both the
</p>
<p>Latin text and its translation in my pocket, to be published in my
</p>
<p>Pamphlet. And he repeated oftentimes that if I would prove the
</p>
<p>contrary of what he had asserted, he would pay over five hundred1
</p>
<p>dollars.
</p>
<p>44 Since -by machinations of secret and open Papists, my labors to*
</p>
<p>enlighten the deluded and to save this Republic from approaching
</p>
<p>destruction, have been frustrated, all my property, alnong which
</p>
<p>were many Manuscripts containing collections on which I had la-
</p>
<p>bored twenty-five years, have been destroyed, attempts to kill me,
</p>
<p>conspiracies against my life, though detected; and as though these
</p>
<p>evils were insufficient, my best fellow-laborer, John George Zeigler,
</p>
<p>while traveling to assist me in this work, was pushed from a Steam- ^
</p>
<p>boat into the Ohio river, the Murderer then swore that Zeigler was
</p>
<p>insane and must himself have jumped into the Ohio river. But his
</p>
<p>letters tome testify to his soundness of mindy and another document
</p>
<p>testifies that he was pushed into the River by a Papist.
</p>
<p>Likewise, since Conventions appointed by me have been disturb-
</p>
<p>ed, and almost at all times during and after meetings, disturbances
</p>
<p>have been created by assertions, as above stated, and thus people are
</p>
<p>deluded and kept back from attending Conventions appointed by
</p>
<p>me, I am compelled to apply to the Law against Mr. M , by its
</p>
<p>application to frighten secret and open Papists from similar actions,
</p>
<p>and to arouse attention to my next Convention, proposed to be held
</p>
<p>in Mercer, and for wfoich I was preparing people by Lectures, which

</p>
<p>were delivered in several places in this county. Therefore I -request
</p>
<p>-the* Judge and Court of Mercer to secure not only the five hundred'
</p>
<p>dollars to be paid by Mr. M , according to his own decision,
</p>
<p>when I prove what he requires, and also that care be taken to
</p>
<p>prevent him from executing his malicious intentions towards me;
</p>
<p><for I heard this morning, Nov. 15, 1853, from , tha^he ex-
</p>
<p>pects to prevent me from holding a Convention in this county.
</p>
<p>'1 will prove before the Court the points which he requires, and show
</p>
<p>that I am a true Messenger of Christ, under influence of, and direct-
</p>
<p>ed by the Spirit of Truth and Righteousness, and pertinaciously in-
</p>
<p>sist that the five hundred dollars should be paid over, and that with
</p>
<p>this money anew edition of my "Lecture on the Dreadful Abuse of
</p>
<p>-Human Magnetism in the Mysteries of the Roman Church," with
</p>
<p>Buoh.additions as I may find best, toopen the eyes of Papists, should
</p>
<p>[ 33 I
</p>
<p>be published and gratuitously distributed amongst them. And I de-
</p>
<p>maud from the Court not only that Mr. M. be secured as a danger-
</p>
<p>ous man, but also that action be taken to arrest all secret and known
</p>
<p>Papists or Monarchists, wherever found dangerous to my life; be-
</p>
<p>cause I am laboring as a Citizen of ihe United States to cleanse this
</p>
<p>Republic from the Papal Imperial Royal, that is, Anti-Christian
</p>
<p>Powers, and 1 am bound to make those iremble by the application
</p>
<p>of the Law of the country, who despise the Laws of God."
</p>
<p>Those extracts are taken from the first six pages, to which I have
</p>
<p>put my Signature, as follows: "Andrew B. Smolnikar, formerly
</p>
<p>eighteen years Priest, Monk of the Benedictine Order, and Imperial
</p>
<p>Royal Professor of Biblical Literature; afterwards, by Signs accord-
</p>
<p>ing to Prophecies, declared and confirmed Messenger of the Dis-
</p>
<p>pensation of the Fulness or Times. Ephs. 1:10."
</p>
<p>Then I met with the Judge of that Court, to see whether he had
</p>
<p>taken my document into consideration or not, he replied that he had
</p>
<p>done so, but that thi6 case must be brought before the Congress of
</p>
<p>the United States. I replied that in my case it is expre'ssed, that a
</p>
<p>Convention should be held in Mercer, and (*to use the words in my
</p>
<p>application, which had been given by a Lawyer to the Judge,) "the
</p>
<p>most convenient place will be the Court House of Mercer, and I
</p>
<p>suppose that citizens of this county are not so subjugated by the
</p>
<p>Papal Imperial Royal Power as to refuse to give the Court House
</p>
<p>for such purpose, when that which is most needed to save this Re-
</p>
<p>public from the grasp of Monarchs, will be made manifest, and then
</p>
<p>a concentrated effort will be made to hold a liice Convention in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington City," &c.
</p>
<p>When efforts were made by me after my first personal meeting
</p>
<p>with the Judge, and his advice was given to apply to Congress, I
</p>
<p>discovered such combination against mv just demand, that twoCoin-
</p>
<p>missioners whom I saw, were opposed to giving me the Court House
</p>
<p>for holding our Contention, and soon I understood that I need not
</p>
<p>apply to the third Commissioner, but that it was best to leave the
</p>
<p>county and publish this Pamphlet as soon as assistance could be
</p>
<p>obtained, and then to apply directly to Congress," that they might

<p>learn what is their duty in the present great crisisto appoint a
</p>
<p>Convention, in which Bishops will appear; and I hope they will
</p>
<p>understand that it is their highest duty to proceed in this manner,
</p>
<p>and that Bishop O'Connor particularly will understand that he is in
</p>
<p>a peculiar manner boundv to come to the Convention, and to exhort
</p>
<p>his Colleagues that they should not continue any longer to be stub-
</p>
<p>born sinners against the Holy Spirit, who most energetically exhorts
</p>
<p>them/by this Message to be open to Conviction, and to attend the

<p>Convention.

<p>While I am preparing great things promotive of Harmony and
</p>
<p>Peace of Nations, Messengers from the Heavenly Armies, Rev. xix:

<p>Archbishop Purcell. It would be necessary to write many volumes
</p>
<p>were I to quote and explain all that is published in the few numbers
</p>
<p>of the Telegraph, handed me by Patriarch Kirk land, for confirma-
</p>
<p>tion and illustration of what-is written in this Pamphlet. But I
</p>
<p>shall restrict myself to the 4th and 5th pages of Vol. xxn, No. 46,
</p>
<p>published in Cmcinn-afr, Nov. 5th, 1853. And then I shall explain
</p>
<p>only some points of the quoted pages: a full explanation of the con-
</p>
<p>tents of those two pages, in their connexion with memorable events
</p>
<p>already explained by me in the long chain, with which the Dragon,
</p>
<p>in the 20th chapter of Revelations, is in process of binding, would
</p>
<p>require a volume.
</p>
<p>On the 4th page we read: 44The Consecration of the Rt. Rev.
</p>
<p>Bishops Baraga and Carrell. This solemn and beautiful ceremony
</p>
<p>took place in the Cathedral (of Cincinnati,) on Tuesday, Nov. 1.
</p>
<p>The Most Rev. Archbishop Purcell, Rt. Rev. Bishops Henni, of
</p>
<p>Milwaukie, and Lefevre, of Detroit, were the Consecrating Prelates.
</p>
<p>* * The Consecrated Bishops were assisted by the Very Rev.
</p>
<p>Tfoos. Butler, of Covington, and Rev. Mr. Hammer, of St. Mary's,
</p>
<p>as Chaplains. * * The Bulls of the Pope were read, constitu-
</p>
<p>ting * * Rt. Rev. Frederick Baraga, Bishop of Amyzonia, iry
</p>
<p>the Archiepiscopate of Stauropolis. * * The ceremony ended
</p>
<p>at 2#P. M., and the immense concourse of Catholics diapered from
</p>
<p>the Cathedral thanking and praising God, who in these calamitous
</p>
<p>times is raising up two such devoted Pastors to enlarge the tents cf
</p>
<p>Israel, and beautify the House of Sion. In the afternoon, Rt. Rev.
</p>
<p>Bishop Baraga sang Vespers, and * * preached a short Sermon,
</p>
<p>filling his auditory with the ,4hoJy and wholesome thought" of.
</p>
<p>praying for the dead. * * The Right Rev. Bishop Frederic
</p>
<p>Baraga is a native of a Southern Province of Austria, called Illyria,
</p>
<p>or Carniolia. * * As scon as he had absolved his Juristical ccurse,

<p>he returned, from the University of Vienna to Lai bach and entered

<p>the Seminary, in spite of derision, mockery and satyrical remarks
</p>
<p>from his former worldly friends. He absolved his Theological stu-
</p>
<p>dies with very good success, and was ordained a Priest on the 21st
</p>
<p>of September, 1823. * ,* In the year 1829, the Society of St.
</p>
<p>Leopold was established in Austria, for the support of Missionaries
</p>
<p>in the United States. As soon as he received the first news of it,
</p>
<p>he gave in his mime with the petition to be sent to the Indian Mis-
</p>
<p>sions of North America. * * Bishop Baraga wrote a number of
</p>
<p>works. * * He also Wrote three Indian works, for the Indian1
</p>
<p>Missions. In 1850 he published a Grammar of the Chippewa lan-
</p>
<p>guage, (properly Otchipwe.) in Detroit; and this- year a Dictionary
</p>
<p>of the same language, here in Cincinnati, for the use of Missiona-
</p>
<p>ries. Bishop Baraga is now on his w.ay to Europe, for the purpose
</p>
<p>36 3
</p>
<p>of obtaining Clergymen for his most desolate Diocese of Upper
</p>
<p>Michigan, and hopes to be back again in May next."
</p>
<p>An explanation of these few extracts will show '"n a new and
</p>
<p>remarkable manner how necessary it is lor Congress, without de-
</p>
<p>lay, to appoint the demanded Convention.
</p>
<p>Frederick Baraga, the only son of a Lord of considerable estate,
</p>
<p>was my fellow student in the city ofLaibach, till he went to Vienna
</p>
<p>to study law, while I was studying Theology and was ordained
</p>
<p>Priest, in the year 1819. Then Baraga, on returning, instead of
</p>
<p>taking possession of his Estate, he studied Theology and became
</p>
<p>Priest, thus surprising all his acquaintances, and the more after-
</p>
<p>wards, when he started for America, to be a Missionary, or Apostle
</p>
<p>of the Pope, among Indians. Afterwards, all the glorious works
</p>
<p>and conversions which he effected among them, were published in
</p>
<p>Newspapers of Austria, and Baraga was the greatest Favorite of the
</p>
<p>Imperial Royal Court in Vienna
</p>
<p>This Baraga, tho' a great Zealot of the Pope, on revisiting Eu-
</p>
<p>rope, in 1837, became an instrument of providence to open my way
</p>
<p>to America, To him I sent my first volume, containing the Cre-
</p>
<p>dentials of my Mission, which is the Mission of every true Chris-
</p>
<p>tian. In Spirit I saw Baraga's reception of my volume, on reading
</p>
<p>it and perceiving that my work was not for the support, but aboli-
</p>
<p>tion of Popery, he became pale as if he were dead. Thus agoni-
</p>
<p>zed, and in this dreadful condition, he visited his sister, a widow
</p>
<p>who came from our native country, to dwell with him in the forests
</p>
<p>among Indians. He told her (as she informed me afterwards, when,
</p>
<p>I met with her in Philadelphia,) that I had become crazy. This
</p>
<p>was the usual subterfuge of Priests on hearing what they did not
</p>
<p>expect, and were afraid to examine my reasons and arguments.
</p>
<p>But Henni, who appeared as one of the Consecrating B shops, when
</p>
<p>my first volume appeared in 1838, was Editor of the * Wahrheits-
</p>
<p>Freund," whi:h means 44 Friend of Truth," but which proved to be
</p>
<p>the greatest enemy of Truth when tried by me.
</p>
<p>On Nov. 1st, 1838, which, according to the Popisk Almanac, is
</p>
<p>the Festival of all Saints, on which day in each year, in my move-

</p>
<p>ments for the abolition of Popery, Remarkable Events take place.
</p>
<p>One of which I will state. Samuel Ludvigh, by country a Hunga-
</p>
<p>rian, an Infidel by profession, and at that lime Editor of a weekly
</p>
<p>German Newspaper in Philadelphia, was moved to publish an arti-
</p>
<p>cle, announcing my Mission, and this by reference to the Creden-
</p>
<p>tials presented in the first volume. He prefaced the article, calling
</p>
<p>me Christ's Messenger, as he ascertained it from my writings, in
</p>
<p>which Priests especially, were exhorted to study my volume and
</p>
<p>learn to know the Credentials of my Mission, which also should be
</p>
<p>their Mission, But, Henni, instead of doing so, published in his pa-
</p>
<p>per that I had received the Credentials of my Mission from the Em-
</p>
<p>peror of Austria. TJMien I published my second volume, in which
</p>
<p>was shown his folly and blasphemy of my Master and his Armies,
</p>
<p>Rev. xix:14, by whose co-opration and influence the Credentials of
</p>
<p>our Mission had been prepared. For his obstinate, blind support of
</p>
<p>Popery he received the Bishoprick of Milwaukie.
</p>
<p>After publication of second volume, boih volumes were sent to
</p>
<p>Bishop Rese of Detroit, with exhortation to study them. Then
</p>
<p>meeting with Priest Hammer, wbb had been brought by Baraga
</p>
<p>from Austria to Detroit; and who assisted at the consecration of Bish*
</p>
<p>Op Baraga, on asking him whether he had read my volumes, he an-
</p>
<p>swered in the negative. And when asked his reasons, he replied
</p>
<p>that he came to America to serve the Pope. But Bishop Rese, hav-
</p>
<p>ing, received my first and second German volumes, instead of study-
</p>
<p>ing them, which especially he was bound to do, being a German by
</p>
<p>birth, and by virtue of the seal of whose Diocese I obtained permis-
</p>
<p>sion to come to this country, he rather obeyed the Pope than God;
</p>
<p>he went to Rome, being ordered to do so by the Pope, from whence
</p>
<p>he never returned to America.
</p>
<p>After publication of my third volume, on meeting with Bishop
</p>
<p>Purcejl, (the Consecrating Archbishop of Bishop Baraga,) in 1840f
</p>
<p>returning from the Synod of Bishops in Baltimore, and stopping afc
</p>
<p>different places of his Diocese, I exhorted him, tho' he did not un-
</p>
<p>derstand German himself, to recommend that his German Priests
</p>
<p>should study my volumes rind make to him their report concerning-
</p>
<p>their contents.. From my conversation with him I understood that
</p>
<p>the Bishops,'in their Synod, had conversed about me, and he said
</p>
<p>that I should speak about the matter with the German Priests, who
</p>
<p>happened to be there. I did so, but found that Priests were resolv-
</p>
<p>ed against examining my publications. Strange as it may appear,
</p>
<p>when, several years after, in that same places I made efforts to move
</p>
<p>people to examine my publications, there arose a great persecution
</p>
<p>against me, and attempts were made to kill me. The Holy Ghost,
</p>
<p>whom Bishops communicate with their Priests and their followers,
</p>
<p>made himself very manifest on that occasion.
</p>
<p>I intended here to give only a specimen of such Bishops,and
</p>
<p>Priests as were gathered together at the Consecration of Bishop Ba-
</p>
<p>raga; but in this Pamphlet somewhat must be mentioned of my tri-
</p>
<p>als to move Francis Patrick Kenrick, Archbishop and Metropolitan
</p>
<p>of Baltimore, to examine my works and to appear in public either

</p>
<p>foror against them, that the mattermightbe judged of by the people.
</p>
<p>I knew not that he understood German, till in October, 18*58, I met
</p>
<p>with the Priest who was Parson of the German Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>Congregation in Philadelphia, and he told me that F. P. Kenrick,
</p>
<p>who was at that time Bishop in Philadelphia, understood German.
</p>
<p>Then I went directly to him to move him to study my first volume,
</p>
<p>Because at that time the other vol.umes had not been published, and
</p>
<p>then to debate with me about the matter. But on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion the Bishop was occupied with a funeral. I was told that he
</p>
<p>would soon return, and was requested to wait for him in the parlor
</p>
<p>of his house. I receive directions from invisible Messengers, when
</p>
<p>according to their wisdom, it is proper in this rrianner to give instruc-
</p>
<p>tions to Nations. While I was waiting, an Angel said to me: "Let
</p>
<p>I 37 ]
</p>
<p>(
</p>
<p>the dead bury their dead, go perform thy work." I obeyed, for
</p>
<p>then I was printing the second volume in Philadelphia, and discov-
</p>
<p>ered that at the same timp, and in the same foundry in which my
</p>
<p>second volume was stereotyped, there also was B.shop Kennck's
</p>
<p>"Theologia Dogmatica,1' stereotyped.
</p>
<p>From this circumstance I understood that a Romish Bishop, while
</p>
<p>he is applying his erudition and strength in support of Popery,also
</p>
<p>gives to the worlds in print, the strongest testimony he can for its
</p>
<p>Divine Institution, and perpetuation through all future ages, while
</p>
<p>men in their mortal bodies are completely dead to the true and right
</p>
<p>investigation of this matter; viz: that at present the time of Popery
</p>
<p>is coming to an end. Therefore, I left him in his deadly condition,
</p>
<p>till the end of 1840. T.hen I wrote him an urgent exhortation in
</p>
<p>Latin, to examine my three German volumes then circulation,
</p>
<p>which contains all that is necessary to convert even the strongest
</p>
<p>Papist, suppose he be ready to examine for himself, and is open to
</p>
<p>conviction, as to the position on which I stand. Once more I came
</p>
<p>to Philadelphia, paid him a visit, and understood from his German
</p>
<p>answer to my Latin address, that he had knowledge of the German
</p>
<p>language, and that he was inexcusable if he did not study my vol-
</p>
<p>umes. Although, certainly, it would be very strange if a Bishop
</p>
<p>who publishes the Theology of the Popish Church, refuting all
</p>
<p>Apostates and Heretics, with whom none of his readers do meet,
</p>
<p>that he should not read and be able to refute books written and pub-
</p>
<p>lished in a language which he understood, and in the same city,and
</p>
<p>this by an Apo>tate and Heretic who has fairly challenged him per-
</p>
<p>sonally and by letter, to read them and then discuss the matter with
</p>
<p>him. But at that visit he gave me advice, in this matter to apply to
</p>
<p>the Archbishop of Baltimore. I replied that the Archbishop did not
</p>
<p>understand German, and that therefore it was his duty to study my
</p>
<p>'publications and instruct the Archbishop and other Priests about
</p>
<p>this affair, especially, because he became the Instructor of Priests of
</p>
<p>the United States, by publishing his Latin Theologia, which had
</p>
<p>become a standard work for them. When he learned that my works

</p>
<p>were exceedingly dangerous to his Theologia Dogmatica and The-
</p>
<p>ologia Moralise he would not come in contact with me, although I
</p>
<p>applied to him after publishing my 4th and 5th volumes, sending
</p>
<p>other men, who showed him these publications, and the latter person
</p>
<p>by whom I sent my letter, containing a last exhortation to him; but
</p>
<p>he returned it. Thus his management was best calculated, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the instruction of his Master, the Dragon, who gave him,,as
</p>
<p>a premium for his Theologia, by which he supports his infernal
</p>
<p>Governm nt, the highest station in the United States, by making
</p>
<p>him Archbishop of Baltimore and Metropolitan of Bishops in these
</p>
<p>United States.
</p>
<p>While preparing a "Lecture on the dreadful abuse of Human
</p>
<p>Magnetism in the Mysteries of the Roman Church," I had his
</p>
<p>"Theologia Moralis" at hand, and quoted from it the following
</p>
<p>passage, to be-fouad at the end of the Preface: "In omnibus po&-
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>toltco Prsesull obseqaentes nos semper fufuros sancte policemur."
</p>
<p>I have translated these words: "We encage solemnly that we will
</p>
<p>obey the Apostolic Chief Priest of Mars in all things." Then he
</p>
<p>gives the reason why in all things he will obey the Pope, whom he
</p>
<p>acknowledges to he, *kthe Chief Priest of Mars." Mars is the
</p>
<p>He-uhen God of War, and Bishop Kenrick confesses his Chief
</p>
<p>Priest, the Pope, to be tk Omnium Christianorum Doctorem jidei
</p>
<p>et moritm divinitus constitittitm judicem et custodem" that is,
</p>
<p>**The Doctor or Master of all Christians, the Divinely appointed
</p>
<p>Judge and Keeper of Faith and Morals." Apostolicus Praesul, when
</p>
<p>properly translated, means "Apostolic Chief Priest of Mars," that
</p>
<p>is, of the Heathen God of War, he is the Doctor or Master and
</p>
<p>Judge of all Christians. Bishop, Archbishop and Metropolitan Ken-
</p>
<p>rick, may prdlbst against the proper meaning of the word "/Va?-
</p>
<p>$ul" and assert that he intended to give to that word an improper
</p>
<p>meaning. But the proper meaning only expresses Truth. Bishop
</p>
<p>Kenrick did not know what he wrote, because he wrote by the in-
</p>
<p>spiration of the Dragon, who elevated him to the highest station on
</p>
<p>account of his confession. flis Pope whose blind tools Bishops,
</p>
<p>Priests and their Sheep are, in whose name he spoke, is nothing
</p>
<p>else but the Praesul, or Chief Priest of Mars, the God of War, or
</p>
<p>the Apocalyptical Dragon. Where Mars, or the Apostolic Dragon
</p>
<p>and his Apostles, the Pope and his Bishops, reign, there are wars
</p>
<p>and destruction of life and properly. We must also blindly believe,
</p>
<p>besides all other Popish traditions, that Wafers, or orbicular pieces
</p>
<p>o( baked dough, are transubstantiated, or changed, by Priests, in
</p>
<p>their Masses, fnto Jesus Christs, or we are cursed and burnt, when
</p>
<p>ihe Pope acquires power sufficient to effect this, according to the
</p>
<p>rules of his Church. But where our Message is received, and the
</p>
<p>true Christ reigns, there will be Peace and Happiness, true Liberty
</p>
<p>of Thought, Speech and of the Press. Then and there no Pope
</p>
<p>will be Judge, but Reason will decide according to evidence and
</p>
<p>argument.
</p>
<p>As advised by Bishop Kenrick, I went to the Archbishop of Bal-
</p>
<p>timore, personally, to make a trial of him, to ascertain whether he

</p>
<p>would enjoin it upon those Priests who understand German to ex-
</p>
<p>amine my volumes, and then come to a public debate with me in re-
</p>
<p>gard to their contents. But when I came to the Archbishop's resi-
</p>
<p>dence, I was informed that he was in the country, and from all the
</p>
<p>information I could obtain in Baltimore, T concluded that he was not
</p>
<p>yet ready to arise from the dead. I experienced the same in the
</p>
<p>year 1849, when I invited him to send his Bishops and their Doc-
</p>
<p>tors of Divinity to our Latin Convention. At length he also died,
</p>
<p>physically, and Kenrick of Philadelphia was made Archbishop of
</p>
<p>Baltimore. Now I write to arouse him and other Bishops to under-
</p>
<p>stand that it is high time to receive this Pamphlet as a Precious
</p>
<p>Gift from Heaven, and to do what is required therein, to save
</p>
<p>themselves and their sheep.
</p>
<p>On yesterday, the 4th of December, 186% I was reminded in a
</p>
<p>peculiar manner, to mention Samuel Ludvigh. Examining many
</p>
<p>papers of both parties wht are preparing much fuel for immense
</p>
<p>destruction of human life and property in this country. A paper
</p>
<p>directly opposed to the Cincinnati Telegraph and its consort, the
</p>
<p>Boston Investigator, the editors and su{.porters of which papers
</p>
<p>have been so beastialized by Popish traditions that they do not yet
</p>
<p>know whether man has an immortal soul. But on yesterday, one
</p>
<p>of the departed said to me, that I should go from this city of Pitts-
</p>
<p>burgh to Mr. N. in Allegheny City, and see an article, prepared
</p>
<p>for my use, which is in the Investigator. I arrived just as the num-
</p>
<p>ber for Nov. 30, 1853, was received. .November 30ih is the great
</p>
<p>Festival of the Apostle Andrew, or of the first Apostle of the New.
</p>
<p>Era. In that number there was an article entitled, "Reflections on
</p>
<p>Liberalism," and signed, "Davenport, Iowa, November 2, 1853,
</p>
<p>Ludvigh."
</p>
<p>This is the remarkable Infidel, Snmuel Ludvigh, who was moved,
</p>
<p>on the 1st Nov., 1853, by my invisible Guide, to confess in the news-
</p>
<p>paper "Die Alte und Neus Welt," (the Old and New World,) that
</p>
<p>I am an Apostle* or Messenger of Christ. But Bishop Henni, after
</p>
<p>having read that Confession of an Infidel, reported in his paper that
</p>
<p>I had received the Credentials of my Apostleship from the Emperor
</p>
<p>of Austria, and although in my writings he was exhorted to repent-
</p>
<p>ance, he continued in his cbstinacy, till on the same day, fifteen years
</p>
<p>after, he became one of the Consecratqrs of Bishop Baraga. But
</p>
<p>Baraga, w^en he opened the way to my Apostleship, wrote what
</p>
<p>he firmly believed, that I was called by God to this Mission. Then
</p>
<p>however, the Popish Spirit magnetized him in such manner that he
</p>
<p>continued a blind instrument of the Pope, to draw into Papal bond-
</p>
<p>age as many as he could, and on Nov. 1st he became Bishop, or
</p>
<p>Governor, having appointment from the Pope to the largest Territo-
</p>
<p>ry in any Papal Diocese.
</p>
<p>Samuel Ludvigh, on performance of his task, under inspiration
</p>
<p>of one of the departed of my Society, again came under influence
</p>
<p>of the Infidels. But when needed as witness, he was compelled by
</p>
<p>my invisible Guides to testify in behalf of my Mission. In this connec-
</p>
<p>tion, his testimony as witness against the Bishops, it should be men-

</p>
<p>tioned that he never came into tny room except once, beqause then
</p>
<p>he was needed, therefore he was brought by Invisible Ministers.
</p>
<p>While I was preparing copies of a Latin Circular to be mailed,and
</p>
<p>directed to Bishops, he entered my room, and gave me the ne-
</p>
<p>cessary direction to be entered upon each Circular, sent to every
</p>
<p>Bishop of Hungary. This testimony was needed, that they might
</p>
<p>be inexcusable, because they were preparing destruction for their
</p>
<p>country. Had they received my Message, the tremendous destruc-
</p>
<p>tion and consequent Bondage, mitrht have been prevented* Peace
</p>
<p>might have been obtained, and Freedom would have been firmly
</p>
<p>established.
</p>
<p>Again the Servants ot the Dragon still continuing in their obstina-
</p>
<p>cy, in Cincinnati, on meeting with the Infidel, Sanual Ludvigh,
</p>
<p>[ 40 ]
</p>
<p>I told him that I had Come to give him striking 'testimony that h&
</p>
<p>had an immortal soul, because he was under the influence of depart-
</p>
<p>ed Spirits. He enquired how I could do thai? I replied, that I would
</p>
<p>magnetise him. He said I might do so, directly. But I objected,
</p>
<p>as his boarding-house wis not the right p'ace for this process, but
</p>
<p>he should come to my bearding-house. However, he replied that I
</p>
<p>should make a trial in his residence, and on the fallowing n:ght he
</p>
<p>would come to my place. 1 consented, and soon brought him into
</p>
<p>the Magnetic Sleep. And when so, much as was necessary had
</p>
<p>been done, I told him that on the next night, in my boarding-house,
</p>
<p>he should travel with me into the Spirit-land, and he promised to-
</p>
<p>come. But instead of him personally, I received a few lines from
</p>
<p>him, reporting that his friends had taken him in another direction.
</p>
<p>Thus, when I magnetized him, his Demons were compelled to give
</p>
<p>way to our Spirits. And as soon as I lefi bun, his Demons returned
</p>
<p>and carried nim in the direction of Europe.
</p>
<p>He took a Sword of the American Revolution and seme war in-
</p>
<p>struments of the Indians, crossed the Atlantic and came to Paris,
</p>
<p>addressed the Liberals, and as soon as he had left the city, Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion broke out. Then the same happened in Berlin, and when he
</p>
<p>arrived in Vienna, Prince Mettemich gave orders to the Police to
</p>
<p>arrest him. But Ludvigh escaped and went lo Hungary.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Revolution broke out in Vienna, and Ludvigh-
</p>
<p>dedicated his Sword of Revolution, and other Insignia of War, to
</p>
<p>the National Museum rf Hungary. The Revolution opened the
</p>
<p>way for his return to Vienna. And after performance of his Pro-
</p>
<p>phetical task, he published; in Hamburg, a German Pamphlet, enti-
</p>
<p>tled: "The Sword of Revolution." I mentioned somewhere in my
</p>
<p>publications that he changed his name, Ludwig to Ludvigh, but
</p>
<p>that he made a mistake, and that Lud'-vich would be a complete
</p>
<p>name for his Prophetical task, a name composed of the Slavonian
</p>
<p>Lud, which means people, and the German Vich, which means &
</p>
<p>Beast; because by the Anti-Christian Economy of Bishops the Party
</p>
<p>of Infidels was formed, and people are so bestialized that they do
</p>
<p>not feel the influence from such Sphere of the Spirit-World as they

</p>
<p>Indeed, this Samuel Ludvigh is a very remarkable Representa--
</p>
<p>live of the Infidel Party, and therefore it was necessary that he'
</p>
<p>should be inspired, on the 2d of November, on the Popish Festival
</p>
<p>of All Souls, so that on his journey he wrote the article quoted.
</p>
<p>Baraga, the first time as Bishop, in the afternoon of the 1st of
</p>
<p>November, "preached a short Sermon filling his auditory with the
</p>
<p>holy and wholesome thought of praying for the dead." His Ves-
</p>
<p>pers and Sermon were in commencement of ceremonies which are
</p>
<p>performed on the 2d of November, for Souls, according to the Po-
</p>
<p>pish Ritual. But Popish Bishops and Priests are, in performance
</p>
<p>of their ceremonies, such ignoramuses as the Jewish Priests were!
</p>
<p>in performance of their ceremonies. ''
</p>
<p>I was Professor of Divinity in the Old School, till at length*?'

<p>C 41 ]
</p>
<p>fceCame Doctor of Divinity for the New Era, and in the Contention
</p>
<p>I will give such d;scloiures concerning the Spirit-World, as will be
</p>
<p>sufficient t  draw Popish. Bishops and Priests from their dreadful
</p>
<p>SiipiTfriiUon, as well as professed Infidels from their folly, in which
</p>
<p>they bliiidly and w ckedly deny the immortality of our Souls, and
</p>
<p>thus prep.ire Mh parties as well as their departed friends, for a glo-
</p>
<p>rious Re>upredion, and Harmony and Peace of Nations.
</p>
<p>These warnings ought to be sufficient for Bishops, as well as for
</p>
<p>the President and Congress, to make no delay in meeting me in
</p>
<p>Convention; because, besides thousands of others, the Reporter of
</p>
<p>Bias hop Baraga's Consecration in the Telegraph, as well as Samuel
</p>
<p>Luclvigh, in the Investigator, are testifying the near approaching and
</p>
<p>most dreadful destruction in this country, if not prevented, so far as
</p>
<p>possible, by what shall be unfolded in our Convention; and Par-
</p>
<p>lies who are preparing destruction, might be elevated tothe ground of
</p>
<p>Pacification, of those living in their mortal bodies, and of the depart-
</p>
<p>ed from them.
</p>
<p>While traveling in most of the States, instructing and warning
</p>
<p>people, many Sectarians and Lifidels told me that if any Revolution
</p>
<p>or War should break out, by the fault of Bishops and Priests, they
</p>
<p>would take their rifles and in the first place shoot Bishops and
</p>
<p>Priests, and if they should continue to be so obstinate as they have
</p>
<p>'proved themselves until now, all their power would not be sufficient
</p>
<p>t ) deliver them from destruction. Ludvigh, in the above-quoted ar-
</p>
<p>ticle, writes that: "More than twenty German Journals are in the
</p>
<p>field against Church and Priestcraft," and other things, from which
</p>
<p>it is evident that there will be desperate fighting, if Bishops and
</p>
<p>Priests do not make haste and come on the right platform, and if
</p>
<p>< 'ongress will not make haste for safety of the Union, and take the
</p>
<p>first steps; for I will instruct the President and Congress what to
</p>
<p>do to prevent bloodshed, if they appoint the Convention, tho' Bish-
</p>
<p>ops should refuse to attend.
</p>
<p>One fact in Baraga's Consecration must not be omitted. Among
</p>
<p>his Consecrating Prelates was Bishop Lefevre, of Detroit. After
</p>
<p>the voyage of Bishop Rese to Rome, and his disappearance, Lefe-

<p>vre succeeded as Administrator cf Bishop Rese's Diocese. When
</p>
<p>in May, 1849, Bishops refused to attend my Latin Convention, Pro-
</p>
<p>phetical destructions announced the dreadful approaching calami-
</p>
<p>ties. The riot on Astor's Place, New York, in which a number of
</p>
<p>persons were killed, preceded the Convention, and took place on the
</p>
<p>same night of May, 1849, in which I wrote in April, 1849, to Pres-
</p>
<p>ident Taylor in regard to the Latin Convention. The burning of
</p>
<p>the Steamboat Empire, in Hudson river; also of twenty-seven Steam-
</p>
<p>boats at St. Louis, Missouri, a great stronghold and refuge of Jesuits,
</p>
<p>and ihe co-nbustion of Milwaukie, the infernal residence of Bishop
</p>
<p>Henni, as well as a stronghold pf Infidels, and a number of other
</p>
<p>Prophetical fires at the close of that Convention, which took place
</p>
<p>on such days and at such hours, that when their relation to other
</p>
<p>events connected with the appointment of that Convention will be
</p>
<p>[42]
</p>
<p>shown, the meaning of those destructions will be clear. But at pres-
</p>
<p>ent, the great ignorance in which Editors of newspapers are. held
</p>
<p>in regard to the connection of the living wit.h the deceased, thou-
</p>
<p>sands of disasters are reported in newspapers, the proper meaning
</p>
<p>of which is hidden, as when the Signs were preceding the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of Jerusalem, which had been predicted by Christ.
</p>
<p>After that 1 came to Detroit, to see whether I could move Bishop
</p>
<p>Lefevre to meet with Baraga and other Missionaries from my coun-
</p>
<p>try in a Convention, to hear the reading of my Latin Manuscript,
</p>
<p>after the whole Synod of Bishops had despised Christ's Message
</p>
<p>of Peace. In Detroit I applied first to the Presbyterian Minister,
</p>
<p>Doctor Duffield, who sometimes had spoken publicly against the
</p>
<p>usurpations of Roman Catholic Bishops. To him 1 staled the ol.ject
</p>
<p>of my coming to Detroit, and that if possible I must have the pledge
</p>
<p>of American Protestants who were Latin Scholars to attend the Con-
</p>
<p>vention, if Bishop Lefevre would engage to attend it with his clergy.
</p>
<p>After having obtained the names of a number of Protestant Latin
</p>
<p>Scholars, I wrote an article, in which I invited the Bishop to appear
</p>
<p>with Baraga and other Clergymen in the Convention, and I stated
</p>
<p>the points which I promised to prove in the Convention. I carried
</p>
<p>the writing to the editors of the daily newspapers in Deiio-.i; but
</p>
<p>after perusal of my article, they were afraid to publish it. Such ar>.
</p>
<p>incredible power does a Romish Bishop exercise upon.PioteMam
</p>
<p>newspapers! Then I invited Doctor Duffield to take other Minis-
</p>
<p>ters that they might be witnesses at my trial of the Bishop. He
</p>
<p>took the Methodist Minister of that city with him, and when we
</p>
<p>had come to Bishop Lefevre, after a short introduction, I asked him,
</p>
<p>first: "Did the Archbishop of Baltimore, in your last Synod, read
</p>
<p>my Latin Letter, in which Bishops were invited to attend my Latin
</p>
<p>Convention?"
</p>
<p>When Lefevre gave no answer, f took from my pocket a roll of
</p>
<p>papers, and when I commenced to unroll it, Bishop Lefevre turned
</p>
<p>to the two witnesses arid said, in so still a mannerthat hecould nut be
</p>
<p>heard by me: "This man's head is not right."- His precaution did
</p>
<p>not help him. I perceived his words and felt that he was not pre-

</p>
<p>pared to hear what I intended to read from my papers, and I said
</p>
<p>directly, "You Bishops, when you have no power to kill righteous
</p>
<p>men who dare to come publicly against your usurpations of power,
</p>
<p>and your damnable deeds, you kill them with words, calumniating
</p>
<p>them as thcf' they were insane, and by whatever other means you
</p>
<p>may be able to deceive people." Bishop Benedict Fenwick, when
</p>
<p>first I came publicly in his Diocese, exposing the treachery of Bish-
</p>
<p>ops, by which they endeavor to deliver this Republic into the hands
</p>
<p>ofMonarchs, he first commenced the cry: "Too much learning has
</p>
<p>made Smolnikar mad," and Agents of Bishops repeated the same, be-
</p>
<p>cause they found it to be the best means they could use, to answer
</p>
<p>my arguments.
</p>
<p>WJio is more mad than you, Bishop Lefevre, and your Agent, my
</p>
<p>fellow-student, Baraga, with his associates from my country, who
</p>
<p>[ 43 ]
</p>
<p>are preparing hosts of Indians, that when all may be mature they
</p>
<p>will sally forth from the woods, and kill as many Heretics as they
</p>
<p>can, and be killed by them? But how can h be mad while t am
</p>
<p>preaching Pacification of all Nations, and showing the means by
</p>
<p>which Harmony and Peace will be established on the whole Earth?
</p>
<p>While yet I see that you, Bishop Lefevre, are not prepared to re-
</p>
<p>cede my Message, I will address people in this city, both in the
</p>
<p>English and German languages, that they may judge whether you,
</p>
<p>Bishop Lefevre, and your Colleagues, are not more mad than I am,
</p>
<p>while I proclaim the glorious News of th3 Manifestation of Christ's
</p>
<p>Spirit for Pacification of the World."
</p>
<p>This, my address to Bishop Lefevre, is in connection with the re--
</p>
<p>port of Baraga's Consecration. The Reporter tells: "Bishop Bara-
</p>
<p>ga is now on hit way to Europe, for the purpose of obtaining Cler-
</p>
<p>gvmen for his most desolate Diocese of Upper Michigan." Most
</p>
<p>newspapers are filled with misrepresentations of very important
</p>
<p>facts for this Republic. Baraga, since his arrival as Missionary to
</p>
<p>-this country, his received every year great assistance from private
</p>
<p>persons, as well as from the Society of St. Leopold, and other socie-
</p>
<p>ties, laboring to deliver this Country into the hands of the Pope and
</p>
<p>other Monarchs, and especially when he came himself to our native
</p>
<p>country and assisted me to come to America, he collected many
</p>
<p>thousand dollars. All the riches he could collect were applied to
</p>
<p>make Indians blind tools of the Pope and other Monarchs. In 1840
</p>
<p>I came to the Indians, if possible, to meet with Baraga. But he
</p>
<p>was many hundred miles farther of} than where I thought I would
</p>
<p>find him. i
</p>
<p>I only met with Priest Francis Pierz, a native of .the same town
</p>
<p>with me. He expected that I would chant a solemn Mass, because
</p>
<p>he did not yet know my great Apostacy. But w7hen I began to ex-
</p>
<p>plain the matter to him, he said that I was in great danger. I knew
</p>
<p>that he was not naturally a cruel man, for he was my good friend,
</p>
<p>and his house was next my house in our native town, and the Pope
</p>
<p>had not yet proclaimed Crusades against Heretics and Apostates in
</p>
<p>America. Therefore, I laughed when he tried to frighten me. But

</p>
<p>after this, in my presence, he preached such a Sermon to the In-
</p>
<p>dians against Heretics, that had he proclaimed a Crusade they
</p>
<p>wo&ld have fought to kill them, or to he killed, and go to Heaven by
</p>
<p>the Indulgences of the Pope. I concluded, from conversation with
</p>
<p>Priest Pierz and others, that there were great hosts of Indians in
</p>
<p>the British and Russian Dominions of America. In 1840, when I
</p>
<p>was among the Indians of La Croix, Arbre Croche, &c, many of
</p>
<p>whom, besides others, had been converted by Baraga and his Asso-
</p>
<p>ciates to the Pope of Rome.
</p>
<p>I understood the preaching of Francis Pierz, because he preached
</p>
<p>in-French and an Interpreter translated his words into the Indian
</p>
<p>tongue. But Baraga learned the Indian dialects very fast, and in
</p>
<p>the year 1837 published books for the Indian Schools. uHis most
</p>
<p>daolate Dioce of Upper Michigan," is the most extensive Diocese
</p>
<p>[44 ]
</p>
<p>in the world. He is in close connexion with the Hudson Bay Com-
</p>
<p>pany, who keep a great secrecy concerning their power, havina en-
</p>
<p>tire control over the Indians in the British Dominions. And Bara-
</p>
<p>ga is certainly in such intimacy with tho.^e who have control over
</p>
<p>the Indians in the Russian Dominions in America, as close connex-
</p>
<p>ion and intimacy as the Emperor of Austria has with the Emperor
</p>
<p>of Russia. His knowledge of the Indian languages, the great rich-
</p>
<p>es he receives for their support, and his incredible zeal to bring
</p>
<p>these Indians into the Popish Heaven, gives him great poweramong
</p>
<p>and over them.
</p>
<p>On my arrival and being recommended to them as a Priest, and a
</p>
<p>friend of Baraga, this word was spread among then) with incredible
</p>
<p>speed, and hundreds of them came out from the woods and fell upon
</p>
<p>their knees and faces, worshipping me as if I were a God from Hea-
</p>
<p>ven. I thought that there must be such multitudes of Indians, espe-
</p>
<p>cially in the vast English and Russian Dominions, as there were
</p>
<p>of Barbarians in the Fifth Century, who overrun the Roman Em-
</p>
<p>pire. Now, Baraga, the greatest worshipper of the Pope, and of
</p>
<p>the Emperor of Austria, while preparing the Indians so as to make
</p>
<p>use of them to overthrow this Government, secretly receives as ma-
</p>
<p>ny Missionaries as he needs.
</p>
<p>These few femarks may spread great light upon his present jour-
</p>
<p>ney^to the Pope of Rome, the Emperor of Austria, the Emperor of
</p>
<p>France, and other Monarchs. You are cheated and deluded in all
</p>
<p>directions, while enemies of this Republic are laboring to destroy
</p>
<p>it and deliver this country into the hands of Monarchs. The ques-
</p>
<p>tions to be decided in our Convention are of the most important po-
</p>
<p>litical character. There is nothing less to be decided than, whether
</p>
<p>the Pope of Rome and his Allies, the Emperors and Kings, have a
</p>
<p>Divine Right to subjugate this Republic, or whether we have Di-
</p>
<p>vine Right to require them toco-operaie with us for establishing the
</p>
<p>true Reign of Christ, the Great Republic in which Truth and Right-
</p>
<p>eousness will abound on the whole Earth. -
</p>
<p>Be not deluded in regard to Turkey and her reported victories
</p>
<p>over Russia. That they are very splendid, may be all true, but

<p>what you read in behalf of Turkey, the same may soon be changed
</p>
<p>against your expectation, and, too late, you may come to know that
</p>
<p>the power of all Monarchs is directed, and will continue to be di-
</p>
<p>rected against the Republican principle, till you convince Monarchs
</p>
<p>of Christian name, that the true Republican, is the true Christian
</p>
<p>Principle, and that we have received Divine Mission to spread this
</p>
<p>principle over the whole Earth. The commencement of this Dem-
</p>
<p>onstration should take place in a powerful manner in our Conven-
</p>
<p>tion, and I hope Congress is not yet entirely enslaved by Monarchs,
</p>
<p>and that it will comprehend the important disclosures given in this
</p>
<p>Pamphlet, and by no means hesitate to appoint the required Con-
</p>
<p>vention without delay.
</p>
<p>After Consecration of Bishop Baraga, we read in the "Telegraph"
</p>
<p>the news, that "by the Rev. Bishop Lefevre, of Detroit, a Solemn
</p>
<p>[3
</p>
<p>Miss of Requiem, for the S >uls of all faithful departed, was sung,
</p>
<p>on Wednesday. Nov. 2.'' ( n Thursday a Lecture on the "Papa-
</p>
<p>cy" vv.is delivered by the R.uhi Rev. B.>h >p Spalding. It is to !>
</p>
<p>*inder>t > d lh;it this great Kumioh Orator, kn ws well how to de-
</p>
<p>lude Protestams iu the most important (natters. Immediately alter
</p>
<p>thnt is the following very impoiiant news for us:* * Flight Rev. Dr,
</p>
<p>O'Connor, Bishop of Erie, arrived in th;s city on Wednesday,"
</p>
<p>(Nov. 2.) On the 1st, or Festival ( f all Saints, he miijt have had
</p>
<p>important business to do, and then he had to hurry; because, with-
</p>
<p>out doubt, he had secret communi; ations to entrust to the great Am-
</p>
<p>bassador, Baraga, to be delivered to the Pope and his Kings and
</p>
<p>Queens.
</p>
<p>In the year 184$, while among the Indians, I received the news
</p>
<p>from Priest Pierz, that our countryman, the Franciscan Monk, Ivo
</p>
<p>Leviz, was Parson in Erie, and I came to see him. At that time
</p>
<p>the Popish Congregation in Erie was very small, and Leviz was
</p>
<p>building it a Church. I endeavored to move, nun at least to prom-
</p>
<p>ise to study my publications, but he replied: "I would show you
</p>
<p>any favor which might be in my power, but to read your books is
</p>
<p>not in my power; because I have heard that you have w ritten against
</p>
<p>the Pope, whereas, I have sworn obedience to him and my B:shop;
</p>
<p>therefore, [ would lather give my neck that you might cut my head
</p>
<p>off, than read your books."
</p>
<p>Such'attachment of Monks to the Pope and other Monarchs who
</p>
<p>are united with him, with such incredible perseverence in prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of their aim. at length has converted Erie to be the residence of
</p>
<p>a Roman Catholic Bishop. And mark well, M. O'Connor, whose
</p>
<p>extraordinary power exercised as Bishop of Pittsburgh, might be
</p>
<p>illustrated in this Pamphlet by fact$ which are very important, were
</p>
<p>there but room.
</p>
<p>Who asks why has he become Bishop of Erie? Who asks the
</p>
<p>secret of this change? I only give this hint. Canada is exceeding-
</p>
<p>ly important for Monarchs in their action against the United Stales,
</p>
<p>especially in a war with them Monarchs must have skillful Bishops
</p>
<p>at the principal points on the Lakes in the United States. In this

</p>
<p>respect, Erie is a very important point, and such a Bishop as M.
</p>
<p>O'Connor will know well how to promote the Papal Imperial Royal
</p>
<p>cause from his position there, and be able to give gocd advice to his
</p>
<p>Colleagues for increase of Monarchical power.
</p>
<p>But the counsels of Bishops and their Monarchs wall be vain, and
</p>
<p>at length many Bishops will become true Republicans with us, cast-
</p>
<p>ing away the ensigns of Monarchs and their Popish ceremonies.
</p>
<p>This will be so if the President and Congress carefully examine the
</p>
<p>contents of this Pamphlet, and act accordingly; but obstinate despi-
</p>
<p>sers of our Message of Truth, Liberty, Righteousness and Peace,
</p>
<p>will perish in their u Frightful Shipwreck," an image of which
</p>
<p>is on the same 5th page of the Telegraph, after the Consecration of
</p>
<p>Bishop Baraga; where we read that the very fine ship Annie Jane,
</p>
<p>on her voyage from Liverpool to Quebec, was dismasted and totally
</p>
<p>[ 46 ]
</p>
<p>lost on the night of the 28th Sept., on Barra Island. Upwards of
</p>
<p>three hundred persons, probably Irish emigrants, having perished.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the cause of the Pope and other Munarchs will be dis-
</p>
<p>masted and totally losi by spreading this Message. In traveling to
</p>
<p>the Baraga Indian country, and from thence to Leviz, in Erie, the
</p>
<p>number 300 is remarkable. Leviz, means a small Lion. His resi-
</p>
<p>dence is in Erie.'
</p>
<p>I trust that the President, Members of Congress, and American
</p>
<p>people, will be awakened by the above disclosures. Is it not high
</p>
<p>time to awake out of sleep, the present being a most critical moment?
</p>
<p>But if, in spite of all our disclosures and efforts, there be no awa-
</p>
<p>kening from their dreadful lethargy, and they continue to consume
</p>
<p>the treasures of this Republic for advantage of ^lonarchs, then it is
</p>
<p>the duty of every true Republican to take action to save this coun-
</p>
<p>try from the grasp of Monarch?.
</p>
<p>But, whether the President and Congress will do as they are sol-
</p>
<p>emnly bound or not, matters have come to such a crisis that all true
</p>
<p>Republicans should promote this cause as much as may be in their
</p>
<p>power. Therefore, in every township, persons who first compre-
</p>
<p>hend the contents of this Pamphlet should arouse others, and bv
</p>
<p>them the matter should be communicated to the Magistrate of the
</p>
<p>place. If he, like Gallio of old, cares for none of these things, or
</p>
<p>is opposed to it, then such person or persons may conclude that they
</p>
<p>are Monarchists, and they will be considered and treated as such.
</p>
<p>But true Republicans, comprehending the importance of this
</p>
<p>matter, and seeing necessity for holding Conventions, in which my
</p>
<p>Manuscript, existing in three languages, Latin, German and English,
</p>
<p>might be of some use, if read. Now, if fifty persons desire that
</p>
<p>such meeting may be appointed, and on proper information being
</p>
<p>forwarded to me, with their names, residences, place and time of
</p>
<p>appointment, also, obligation as to responsibility, for defraying lh
</p>
<p>necessary expenses of traveling, boarding, <&cM I will consider my-
</p>
<p>self bound to hold such Meeting, if circumstances permit. But if
</p>
<p>it should be impossible to visit their places, I will send of my pub-
</p>
<p>lication, consider and perpetuate them as my fellow-laborers, accord-

<p>It is hoped the time is near when no true Republican will vote for

<p>any one to become an official who will not co-operate with us for

<p>spreading the contents of the Five Sections presented above, and

<p>more fully explained in the Manuscript to be read in Conventions,

</p>
<p>la the year 1849, when Bishop O'Connor had answered my invitation to
</p>
<p>& p-ubLic examination of my Message of Peace, by the letter published in
</p>
<p>.this Pamphlet, ins Papa* Imperial Royal Band succeeded so well that they
</p>
<p>imprisoned Joseph Barker, one of the Street Preachers, who had been
</p>
<p>aroused to proclaim publicly the abominable deeds of Bishops and Priests,
</p>
<p>who had rejected all my exhortations and continued to rebel against God.
</p>
<p>and his Christ. By Barker's imprisonment the Republican citizens of
</p>
<p>Pittsburgh were aroused, and elected him Mayor whiie he was in Prison,
</p>
<p>and the city never had a Mayor who frightened Monarchists more, power-
</p>
<p>fuuy supported Free Speech, made public the bad deeds of previous ad-
</p>
<p>ministrations, by which the city had been involved in great debts He also
</p>
<p>showed how the debts could be got rid of in the easiest manner, by neces-
</p>
<p>sary acts of justice, and the restoration of a just taxation.
</p>
<p>But the Popish imperial Royal Band, on Barker s time being up, suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded so well as to elect a man to be Mayor whose first business was to
</p>
<p>put down Freedom of Speech and Street Preaching.
</p>
<p>Sometimes 1 thought best to address people on Streets and Marketplaces
</p>
<p>in Pittsburgh, when they had been assembled by . others. After having
</p>
<p>heard ihat the Mayor was preparing to put down Street Preaching, I came
</p>
<p>one Sabbath with Patriarch Kirkland, to address people, on a very spacious
</p>
<p>piaee of a street. Kirkland opened the meeting, and 1 addressed the peo-
</p>
<p>ple. During my address, a Constable delivered the Message of the Mayor
</p>
<p>10 Kirkland, that he must dismiss the people. Then Kirkland and those
</p>
<p>assembled agreed that the Message was Anti-christiaii and Anti-constitu-
</p>
<p>tional. We were told that a number of Policemen and other officers were
</p>
<p>among those assembled, and 1 told them that they should carry my Message
</p>
<p>to the Mayor, that after 1 had by letter invited Bishop 0! Connor,.then on
</p>
<p>the streets of Pittsburgh, and in Patriarch Kirkland s Paper, entitled Street
</p>
<p>Preacher, to publicly debate with me on subjects which all Bishops ought
</p>
<p>to know, but which they do not, but through ignorance are preparing to
</p>
<p>ruin this Republic; and whereas the Bishop did not accept, my invitation,
</p>
<p>and continues to be obstinate to and regardless of my exhortations, that in
</p>
<p>these circumstances, the most important business for the Mayor of Pitts-
</p>
<p>burgh would be to gather together Bishop O'Connor and all his Priests and
</p>
<p>Monks to a publie Debate with me, and if they would not come together

</p>
<p>publicly, to make known that he felt" it to be his duty, as far as he was
</p>
<p>able, to protect Street Preaching*against the Anti-christian and Anti-re-
</p>
<p>publican proceedings of Bishops and Priests.
</p>
<p>After this, my Address and Message to the Mayor, I was wailing in
</p>
<p>Pittsburgh till he would perform his duty as an American Mayor of an Amer-.
</p>
<p>ican city should have done; but instead of bringing the Bishop and his
</p>
<p>Priests to a public discussion with me, he east Patriarch Kirkland into
</p>
<p>Pnson.
</p>
<p>Then I left the city and went to Butler, Pa., whilst the Court was in Ses-
</p>
<p>sion there. The Commissioners permitted me the use of the Court House
</p>
<p>to address people in at candle-light, when the Court would not be in Ses-
</p>
<p>sion. During my address, Papists raised a terrible riot and stopped my
</p>
<p>address, and when I would go out, my friends warned me that there was
</p>
<p>great danger of losing my life; that Papists were before and about the
</p>
<p>Court House ready to attack me. Then they brought me out by a small
</p>
<p>side-door, so that 1 got to my boarding-house.
</p>
<p>On the next day, while 1 was preparing to prosecute the Destroyers of
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the witnesses assured me that the principal Rioter was an
</p>
<p>Irishman, working for the President Judge of the Court, and his particular
</p>
<p>favorite.
</p>
<p>I obtained permission from the Commissioners^ on the next Sunday, to
</p>
<p>hold a German Meeting in the Court House. The meeting was announced,
</p>
<p>and I intended in a peculiar manner to warn Germans not to imitate the
</p>
<p>bad example of the deluded persons who raised the riot during my English
</p>
<p>Lecture. But the Judge then went to the Commissioners and required
</p>
<p>them not to give the key of the Court House for my meeting.
</p>
<p>C 48 }
</p>
<p>A Constable brought this message. I asked some persons how a Judge'
</p>
<p>could be seduced to do such damnably Ami Republican actions? For an-
</p>
<p>swer i was lold that the time was approaching for an e;eciion of Judge by'
</p>
<p>vote of the people, and that by doin- so he would secure the votes of Ko~
</p>
<p>man CaLhoiics.
</p>
<p>When 1 saw that the Judge deserved to be punished, rather than the Ri-
</p>
<p>oters, i wrote an article, exp.anting the case, and would have published it
</p>
<p>in the newspaper of the opposite par^y to the party of the Judge. * But the
</p>
<p>Editor was afraid to publish it. Then 1 sent the article, by mail, to the
</p>
<p>Editor of the "Protestant," in Pittsburgh, and wrote the Editor privately
</p>
<p>to send me copies of the numper in which my article would be published*
</p>
<p>But 1 received no copies. Then I went to Pittsburgh, but the Editor assu-
</p>
<p>red me he- had not received my article.
</p>
<p>Having experienced such incredible corruption in all branches of the
</p>
<p>Administration, 1 committed the President Judge of the Butler Court to
</p>
<p>the just judgment of God, and left Pittsburgh for Ohio. Instead of going
</p>
<p>directly to such places as I had intended to visit on setting out, my Guide-
</p>
<p>said that 1 should visit an Associate Judge uf the President Judge, whom I
</p>
<p>had committed to the judgment of God.
</p>
<p>When I came to him and he was explaining to me how he had been con-
</p>
<p>verted to believe in the immortality of the Soul by Rapping Spirits? his
</p>
<p>son brought the news that the President Judge had died suddenly, and I
</p>
<p>understood from the information as to the time of his sudden death, that it
</p>
<p>was at the same moment when the Angel of the Lord in-formed me that I
</p>
<p>shouid go and see the Associate Judge.
</p>
<p>Immediately the Spirit of the deceased President. Judge became a strong
</p>
<p>Rapping Spirit, but he gave not his own, but another name. On ap-
</p>
<p>proaching the place where he was Rapping, he gave this communication:
</p>
<p>that he must leave the house and go into the Planet Venus, having impor-
</p>
<p>tant business there. I remained the next night in that house, and at mid-
</p>
<p>night h-e made strong lapssoun# similar to breaking of crocks in a cor-
</p>
<p>ner of the room where I was resting. My Leader informed me that the
</p>
<p>Rapper was the Judge, who was laken away by the judgment of God.
</p>
<p>His abode is in the infernal regions, from which he comes surrounded by in-
</p>
<p>fernal electricity, with which raps are produced,- and'when this lying spir-

<p>it has deluded, for a time, those who like to be instructed by him, he is cast-
</p>
<p>again into his irtfeimal abode.
</p>
<p>This, as well as many other points whih have been mentioned in this'
</p>
<p>Pamphlet, which cannot be fully explained now, but are so explained im
</p>
<p>other Manuscripts, which, when published, in due time you will receive
</p>
<p> all that you need. If space allowed, 1 would give peculiar warnings to*
</p>
<p>Postmasters and Secret Societies, but I hope what now appears will be
</p>
<p>sufficient for the'present. And Jesuit Postmasters will be turned out of-
</p>
<p>office, and all members from Societies, who prevent or neglect the spread-
</p>
<p>ing of this Pamphlet, thus showing that they are not true Republicans.
</p>
<p>Since the riot in the Court House of Buller is in close connexion with what
</p>
<p>happened in the Court House of Mercer, where the Successor of the Rap-
</p>
<p>ping Spirit had given advice that. I should apply to Congress, it was proper
</p>
<p>to mention the Judgment of God against the Judge of Iniquity. Likewise,-
</p>
<p>because Demons, through the Foxes, began to rap in the same month, viz:
</p>
<p>in February, 1848, when also they commenced the Revolution in Europe.
</p>
<p>And i have declared many times since, that Rapping Spirits will be dread-
</p>
<p>ful Destroying Spirits in this Country, if people will not prevent destruc-
</p>
<p>tion by spreading our Message of Peace. Whosoever comprehends this^
</p>
<p>Should spread this work as far as possible, and thus be a chosen and faith-
</p>
<p>ful fellow-laborer of his sincere Brother, v
