</p>
<p>SCENE I
</p>
<p>The curtain rising discloses a cavern in Pandemo-
</p>
<p>nium, the huge palace of the Arch-Fiend.
</p>
<p>It is dark, except for green and red lights that
</p>
<p>flicker grimly on the walls. From the ceiling there
</p>
<p>is a continual movement as of wings and flying
</p>
<p>things. Distant wailings and moanings are heard.
</p>
<p>A dim mist of smoke comes dow?i at intei'vals fol-
</p>
<p>lowed by lurid flashes of lightning.
</p>
<p>As the scene progresses the light grows stronger.
</p>
<p>In the center at back Satan is discovered sitting in
</p>
<p>sinister majesty on a high throne. Beelzebub and
</p>
<p>Moloch stand on either side of their master.
</p>
<p>Through a low opening to the left, spirit shapes
</p>
<p>and shadowy forms are entering. They approach
</p>
<p>in pairs, some few cowering in fear and terror, oth-
</p>
<p>ers walking erect; all prostrate themselves before
</p>
<p>Satan.
</p>
<p>The spirits of Nero, Marc Antony, Attila, Richard
</p>
<p>III, Bismarck, and many other notables of history
</p>
<p>appear. These intermingle with throngs of devils
</p>
<p>and menials conspicuous with their forked horns.
</p>
<p>The warriors are distinguished by their respective
</p>
<p>costumes, head-gear, and armor.
</p>
<p>Satan {as a hush falls over the conclave) .

<p>Who shouts His soulful metres oft in vain
</p>
<p>To herds of monks and priests. They're
</p>
<p>underlings;
</p>
<p>Their churches are kennels where frail
</p>
<p>Goodness breeds
</p>
<p>And later spreads in foul preeminence.
</p>
<p>Aye, this concerns our glory. Come near-
</p>
<p>er.
</p>
<p>In confidence wherefor I wish to speak:
</p>
<p>The worst that I can say will prove the
</p>
<p>best.

</p>

<p>eyes the famous queen makes appeal-

<p>casts them at her feet]
</p>
<p>[Satan, however, does not heed her,
</p>
<p>but instead with growing impatience
</p>
<p>beckons some of his servants to re-

<p>It is night.
</p>
<p>Panoplies of armor reminiscent of the middle ages

<p>glimmer on the walls.
</p>
<p>There is a small door to the left at back. Adjacent
</p>
<p>to this is distinguished a bust of Napoleon resting
</p>
<p>on a pedestal. The curtain rising, the "All-High-
</p>
<p>est" is discovered in full military uniform sitting in

<p>front of his desk. Resting on his elbows with head
</p>
<p>between his hands he is vainly endeavoring to keep

<p>SCENE IF
</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon. A battle-field in Flanders
</p>
<p>within the German lines.
</p>
<p>The curtain rising discloses rows of trenches in the
</p>
<p>outermost background, whence come cries and the
</p>
<p>roaring of artillery. Flames every now and then
</p>
<p>are seen to spurt up in the distance. To the left
</p>
<p>at back stands a field hospital towards which streams
</p>
<p>of wounded are being carried or borne on stretchers.
</p>
<p>In the foreground General von Hofen and Captain
</p>
<p>Harrach are discovered with other members of the
</p>
<p>staff. Some of the officers are standing while others
</p>
<p>are sitting about a large table littered with
</p>
<p>steins and bottles, papers, maps, telephones, and vari-
</p>
<p>ous military paraphernalia. A?i orderly stands by
</p>
<p>filling the General's glass and those of the other
</p>
<p>officers.

<p>small heavily grated window to the left at back

<p>admits the last flood-light of a waning moon, while

<p>in the distance the first frail streaks of dawn appear.

<p>a feeble lamp is burning. Against the right wall

<p>is an iron bed before which as the curtain rises,
