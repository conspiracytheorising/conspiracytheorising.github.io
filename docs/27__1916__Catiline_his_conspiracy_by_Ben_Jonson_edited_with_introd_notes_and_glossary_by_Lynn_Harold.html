<p>PREFACE
</p>
<p>The noteworthy interest aroused in the rather long
</p>
<p>neglected works of Ben Jonson within the last dozen years
</p>
<p>would in itself be sufficient justification for a separate
</p>
<p>edition of Catiline, even were the play not intrinsically
</p>
<p>worthy. However, Catiline is by no means a despicable
</p>
<p>drama. Flat as its declamation may seem beside the
</p>
<p>rapid action of the romantic drama, it yet contains patent
</p>
<p>evidences of greatness. The touch of a master  hand
</p>
<p>(although it seems at times misguided) is everywhere
</p>
<p>present in the firm grasp of character, in the orderly
</p>
<p>progression of plot, and in the marvelous skill with which
</p>
<p>so many classical sources are fused into one organic whole.
</p>
<p>Further, Catiline has a very definite historical interest.
</p>
<p>It was the weight of Ben Jonson 's authority and example
</p>
<p>in Sejanus and Catiline that firmly established the
</p>
<p>Senecan tragic traditions and methods, which had pre-
</p>
<p>viously had but a precarious foothold, upon our stage. ^
</p>
<p>Then, too, critics generally have been too hasty in as-
</p>
<p>cribing the so-called 'classical age' entirely to French
</p>
<p>influence. Without unduly belittling this foreign agency,
</p>
<p>I yet think it may be safely maintained that under the
</p>
<p>impetus of Ben Jonson 's authority, a 'classical' drama
</p>
<p>of some sort was bound to evolve.
</p>
<p>In editing Catiline, I have devoted a great deal of atten-
</p>
<p>tion to sources, because Jonson is pecuHarly faithful to
</p>
<p>his authorities, priding himself on his erudite and accurate
</p>
<p>classicism. In this consideration of sources, I owe a
</p>
<p>great debt to an unpublished thesis in the hbrary of Yale
</p>
<p>University, by Miss Ahce P. Wright, A Study of Ben

<p>Jonson's Catiline with Special Reference to its Sources.
</p>
<p>The scope and sureness of Miss Wright's classical knowl-
</p>
<p>edge have spared me many plodding hours. I have not
</p>
<p>always agreed with her results, at times I have omitted
</p>
<p>citations I thought irrelevant, at times I have made sub-
</p>
<p>stitutions that seemed to me more nearly parallel to the
</p>
<p>text, and I have added much new material ; but even
</p>
<p>with these deductions, a heavy share of the credit belongs
</p>
<p>to her. I need hardly state that I have verified every
</p>
<p>citation. Another debt which I owe, and take equal
</p>
<p>pleasure in acknowledging, is to Mr. W. A. WTiite of New
</p>
<p>York City, for his kindness in lending me the Quartos of
</p>
<p>1611 and 1635 for collation. I also desire to convey my
</p>
<p>thanks, for help in various matters of detail, to Professors
</p>
<p>HannsOertel, Frederick W. WilHams, Clarence W. Mendell,
</p>
<p>and Henry B. Wright of Yale University; and to the
</p>
<p>Yale Elizabethan Club for the use of their copy of the
</p>
<p>1 616 Folio. I wish also to acknowledge the uniform
</p>
<p>consideration and courtesy of the officials of the Yale
</p>
<p>University Library, the Northwestern University Library,
</p>
<p>the Newberry Library of Chicago, the University of
</p>
<p>Minnesota Library, and the St. Paul Public Library.
</p>
<p>Most especially do I wish to express my gratitude to
</p>
<p>Professor Albert S. Cook, without whose inspiring counsel
</p>
<p>and aid this work would never have been completed.
</p>
<p>A portion of the expense of printing this book has
</p>
<p>been borne by the English Club of Yale University from
</p>
<p>funds placed at its disposal by the generosity of Mr. George

</p>
<p>in the Class of 1874.

<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>A. Editions of the Play
</p>
<p>Collations and Descriptions
</p>
<p>Catiline was first acted in 1611, and published in the
</p>
<p>same year in quarto (Q i). There is no entry of it in the
</p>
<p>Stationers' Registers, but this lack is not unusual, for 'the
</p>
<p>Registers by no means include everything which appeared
</p>
<p>from the press. Those who held special privileges or
</p>
<p>monopolies for printing a certain book, or, maybe, a whole
</p>
<p>class of books, were not, apparently, under obligation to
</p>
<p>enter such books, and the royal printers were also superior
</p>
<p>to the rule so far as the works included in their patent
</p>
<p>were concerned.'^ However, the charter of the Company
</p>
<p>of Stationers was stringent enough to prevent the lawful
</p>
<p>printing of any work not entered on its books, unless
</p>
<p>exempt as above stated. Of course, numerous 'pirated'
</p>
<p>editions were issued by the secret presses ; but the 1611
</p>
<p>Quarto of Catiline can scarcely have been of this type,
</p>
<p>as a glance at its title-page will show : CATILINE |
</p>
<p>his I CONSPIRACY | Written | by | BEN : ION SON. |
</p>
<p>LONDON, I Printed for Walter Burre. \ 1611, | Walter
</p>
<p>Burre was a member in good standing of the Company,
</p>
<p>and had already issued editions of Jonson's Alchemist,
</p>
<p>Sejanus, and Volpone. This Quarto is a clearly printed
</p>
<p>volume, containing : title, one leaf (verso, heraldic device) ;
</p>
<p>dedication, one leaf ; addresses to the reader, one leaf recto ;
</p>
<p>commendatory verses, ^ one leaf verso, one leaf recto ;
</p>
<p>names of the actors, one leaf verso ; text B O3 in fours.

</p>
<p>X Introduction
</p>
<p>The addresses to the reader (also found in Q2) are de-
</p>
<p>cidedly Jonsonian in flavor. W. and G. introduced them
</p>
<p>into their editions. They read as follows :
</p>
<p>'TO THE READER IN ORDINARIE.
</p>
<p>'The Muses forbid, that I should restraine your medling,
</p>
<p>whom I see alreadie busie with the Title, and tricking
</p>
<p>ouer the leaues : It is your owne. I departed with my
</p>
<p>right, when I let it first abroad. And now, so secure an
</p>
<p>Interpreter I am of my chance, that neither praise, nor
</p>
<p>dispraise from you can affect mee. Though you commend
</p>
<p>the two first Actes, with the people, because they are the
</p>
<p>worst ; and dislike the Oration of Cicero, in regard you
</p>
<p>read some pieces of it, at Schoole, and vnderstand them
</p>
<p>not yet ; I shall finde the way to forgiue you. Be any-
</p>
<p>thing you will be, at your owne charge. Would I had
</p>
<p>deseru'd but halfe so well of it in translation, as that
</p>
<p>ought to deserue of you in iudgment, if you haue any.
</p>
<p>I know (whosoeuer you are) to haue that, and more. But
</p>
<p>all pretences are not iust cla3nTies.
</p>
<p>'The commendation of good things may fall within a
</p>
<p>many, their approbation but in a few ; for the most
</p>
<p>commend out of affection, selfe tickling, an easiness, or
</p>
<p>imitation ; but men iudge only out of knowledge. That
</p>
<p>is the trying faculty. And, to those works that will beare
</p>
<p>a Iudge, nothing is more dangerous then a foolish prayse.
</p>
<p>You will say I shall not haue yours, therefore ; but rather
</p>
<p>the contrary, all vexation of Censure. If I were not aboue
</p>
<p>such molestations now, I had great cause to think vn-
</p>
<p>worthily of my studies, or they had so of mee. But I
</p>
<p>leaue you to your exercise. Beginne.
</p>
<p>'To the Reader extraordinary.
</p>
<p>'You I would vnderstand to be the better Man, though
</p>
<p>Places in Court go otherwise ; to you I submit my selfe,

</p>
<p>and worke. Farewell. BEN : lONSON.'
</p>
<p>Editions of the Play xi
</p>
<p>All marginal notes are omitted in this Quarto.
</p>
<p>The next appearance of the play was in the Folio of 1616.
</p>
<p>There are several mutually independent impressions of
</p>
<p>this,^ of which I have seen two  the one in the Yale Li-
</p>
<p>brary (Fi), and the one in possession of the Yale EHza-
</p>
<p>bethan Club (F2). Fi reads: LONDON | Printed by \
</p>
<p>William | Stanshy. \ An" D. 1616. F2 reads : LONDON |
</p>
<p>Printed hy W : \ Stanshy. and are | to be sould by |
</p>
<p>Rich: Meighen | AnD. 1616. Although Aurelia Henry ^
</p>
<p>mentions a copy in the British Museum reading similarly
</p>
<p>to F2, which varies in 'a few instances of punctuation,
</p>
<p>spelling, and typography' from Fi, I can discover no
</p>
<p>differences in Catiline. A collation of the two texts
</p>
<p>reveals an absolute identity : title-page, verso blank ; dedi-
</p>
<p>cation recto, catalogue verso, etc.^ Even the misprint in
</p>
<p>Catiline, where page 713 is headed 317, is repeated. Fi
</p>
<p>has been chosen as the text of the present edition, because
</p>
<p>it exhibits the most consistency, and contains the fewest
</p>
<p>apparent errors. Although it varies in numerous par-
</p>
<p>ticulars from the text of Qi, the fact that its variations
</p>
<p>have been pretty generally incorporated in the later prin-
</p>
<p>tings indicates that it was from the first regarded as
</p>
<p>authoritative.
</p>
<p>Following Catiline's appearance in the 1616 Folio came
</p>
<p>the Quarto of 1635 (Q2), reading, CATILINE | HIS |
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY I WRITTEN | BY | BEN : lONSON |
</p>
<p>And now Acted by his MAIESTIES Servants | with
</p>
<p>great Applause, | LONDON : | Printed by N. ORES, for
</p>

</p>
<p>result with respect to Catiline in Fi and F2.
</p>
<p>xii Introduction
</p>
<p>mistakes show. Its text follows in the main Qi, as omis-
</p>
<p>sion of the marginal directions indicates. The collation
</p>
<p>is as follows : title-page, one leaf (verso blank) ; addresses
</p>
<p>to the reader, one leaf recto ; commendatory verses, one
</p>
<p>leaf verso, one leaf recto ; catalogue, one leaf verso ; text
</p>
<p>B-L4 in fours (bottom margins cut into).
</p>
<p>In 1640 appeared the second Folio of Jonson's complete
</p>
<p>works (1640)  a slovenly piece of printing, containing
</p>
<p>many errors, such as a part for apart in i. 340 ; our for out
</p>
<p>in I. 357 ; the omission of the second you in 2. 78 ; vpon for
</p>
<p>vnto in 3. 196 ; Porter for potter in 3. 542 ; Of for Or in 4.
</p>
<p>550 ; SEN. for SER. in i. 572, etc. Aside from its errors,
</p>
<p>it differs little from Fi, although it would seem, upon the
</p>
<p>evidence offered by Aurelia Henry, 1 not to be a re-

<p>In 1674 appeared the third Quarto (Q3) of Catiline.

<p>In 1756 appeared Peter Whalley's edition of the works

<p>new characters, encloses all verse in quotation-marks, and
</p>
<p>runs in Jonson's marginal directions between the lines,
</p>
<p>or as footnotes. His text in the main follows that of
</p>
<p>1716, although it is not quite so faulty. Whalley's edi-
</p>
<p>tion was reprinted by John Stockdale, London, 1811.

<p>In 1816 WiUiam Gifford produced his edition of Jonson

<p>choosing the Folio of 1616 as the standard of his text, but
</p>
<p>also considering the readings of the Quartos. Although
</p>
<p>not entirely thorough, his edition is much superior to
</p>
<p>Whalley's, both in text and notes. He very amusingly
</p>
<p>loses patience many times with W^halley's somewhat pu-
</p>
<p>erile emendations, and takes him to task in rather caustic
</p>
<p>and mordant terms : notwithstanding which, he is him-

<p>self free in making emendations, usually without com-

<p>ment. Gifford is the first to divide the acts into scenes
</p>
<p>according to place instead of according to speaker, and
</p>
<p>gives the setting of each scene. All entrances and exits
</p>
<p>of characters are noted by him in stage-directions or side-
</p>
<p>notes. These changes make a play such as Catiline much
</p>
<p>more intelhgible to the general reader. Gifford 's text is
</p>
<p>available in his two editions, those of 1816 and 1846, and
</p>
<p>in the reprint with 'perfunctory improvements' (the
</p>
<p>phrase is Dr. Herford's) by Lieut. -Col. Cunningham in
</p>
<p>1875, which is still the standard for Jonson's complete
</p>
<p>works. His alterations of the text are mainly modern-
</p>
<p>izations : ay for the interjection / ; them or 'em for 'hem ;

<p>have for ha' ; the for th\ etc. All important variants
</p>
<p>will be found in the footnotes to the text.^
</p>
<p>So far as I have been able to learn, there are no trans-
</p>
<p>lations of Catiline.
</p>
<p>B. Date and Stage-History
</p>
<p>The date of the first acting of Catiline, according to
</p>
<p>the title-pages of Fi, F2, and Qi, was 1611. As all dates
</p>
<p>were then reckoned in old style, however, this may well
</p>
<p>have been 1612 ; and the absence of a record in the
</p>
<p>Stationers' Registers leaves us without any definite data.
</p>
<p>The title-page of Q2 informs us that the play was at
</p>
<p>that time (1635) 'acted by his MAIESTIES Servants
</p>
<p>with great Applause,' but I am unable to discover any
</p>
<p>contemporary notes of its appearance.
</p>
<p>It was early revived at the Restoration, and was, on
</p>
<p>the whole, well received. Under date of December 11,
</p>
<p>1667, Pepys says, ' I met . . . Harris, the player, and there

<p>we talked . . . particularly of Catiline, which is to be sudden-
</p>
<p>ly acted at the King's house ; and there all agree that it
</p>
<p>cannot be well done at that house, there not being good
</p>
<p>actors enow : and Burt acts Cicero, which they all con-
</p>
<p>clude he will not be able to do well. The King gives
</p>
<p>them  500 for robes, there being, as they say, to be six-
</p>
<p>teen Scarlett robes.' On December 18, 1668, the play
</p>
<p>was produced, evidently somewhat later than had been
</p>
<p>at first planned, with Hart as Catiline, Mohun as Cethegus,
</p>
<p>Burt as Cicero, and Mrs. Corey as Sempronia. On the
</p>
<p>next afternoon Pepys saw it, but was not greatly im-
</p>
<p>pressed, as his words testify : '. . . Saw Catiline's Con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, yesterday being the first day : a play of much
</p>
<p>good sense and words to read, but that do appear the
</p>
<p>worst upon the stage, I mean, the least diverting, that
</p>
<p>ever I saw any, though the most fine in clothes ; and a fine
</p>
<p>scene of the Senate, and of a fight, that ever I saw in my
</p>
<p>hfe. But the play is only to be read.'
</p>
<p>The play was still being revived in 1674, as the title-
</p>
<p>page of Qs shows : 'As it is now Acted by his MA JE-
</p>
<p>STIE'S Servants.' John Downes in his Roscius Angli-
</p>
<p>canus mentions Catiline as one of the stock plays com-
</p>
<p>monly produced in his day, all of which, he states, ' proved
</p>
<p>very satisfactory to the town.' Gerard Langbaine the
</p>
<p>younger in his Account of the English Dramatic Poets (Ox-
</p>
<p>ford, i6oi),i says that Catiline continued 'still in vogue
</p>
<p>on the stage (in his time) , and was always presented with
</p>
<p>success.' However, there is no reason to believ^e that the
</p>
<p>play survived on the stage longer than the opening years
</p>
<p>of the eighteenth century. In the main, Pepys' conten-
</p>
<p>tion that Catiline is ' only to be read ' is right ; although
</p>
<p>one could hardly imagine it a total failure on the stage, it
</p>
<p>is to-day primarily a 'closet-drama.'

<p>xvi Introduction
</p>
<p>C. Literary Relationships
</p>
<p>Catiline is a play of frank borrowings. In Jonson's
</p>
<p>day, when classical knowledge was held in rather more
</p>
<p>popular esteem than at present, it is highly probable that
</p>
<p>a considerable number of his readers and auditors rec-
</p>
<p>ognized at once a large share of his quotations and allu-
</p>
<p>sions. The only method of producing a true historical
</p>
<p>play was, in Jonson's mind, his own  that of painstaking
</p>
<p>reference to the classics. Jonson was one of the few Ehza-
</p>
<p>bethans who had any regard for 'atmosphere,' and to
</p>
<p>whom such anachronisms as the striking of a clock in
</p>
<p>Brutus' orchard^ were abominations, A Roman play
</p>
<p>must be Roman, and its characters must speak as Romans
</p>
<p>spoke. On such a hypothesis, there could be but one
</p>
<p>conclusion : one must go to Roman speeches as they have
</p>
<p>been handed down to us, go to contemporary documents
</p>
<p>and transcribe them. Such a thesis is in the main right,
</p>
<p>but in it lies the grave danger of making too much of the
</p>
<p>letter at the expense of the spirit. This is precisely Jon-
</p>
<p>son's case. Great as was his ingenuity, great as were his
</p>
<p>assimilative powers, there yet remains in Catiline much
</p>
<p>suspended erudition : masses of pedantry, so to speak, not
</p>
<p>in perfect solution. The traces of mosaic work (to change
</p>
<p>the figure), work very clever in itself withal, are not to-
</p>
<p>tally obliterated. However, in justice to Jonson, one must
</p>
<p>add that to the general reading-public of to-day, not so
</p>
<p>versed in classic lore as the poet's auditory, these things
</p>
<p>are not greatly in evidence.
</p>
<p>As I have said, Catiline is a play of frank borrowings.
</p>
<p>At times it is a literal transcript of authorities, at other
</p>
<p>times it is strongly reminiscent of them. In his efforts
</p>
<p>to catch the true Latin 'atmosphere,' the author even
</p>
<p>goes so far as to twist the Enghsh idiom, as in 4. 823,

</p>
<p>where I heare ill is the poet's attempt to render the Latin
</p>
<p>male audio, ' I am ill spoken of. ' Then, too, there are his
</p>
<p>translations of virtus by vertue, pietas by pietie, and the like.
</p>
<p>The odor of the scholar's taper is strong upon such.
</p>
<p>The sources of Catiline fall readily into three main
</p>
<p>classes : first, those of the plot, wherein I include the char-
</p>
<p>acters ; second, those of the dialogue ; and third, those
</p>
<p>of the choruses. To the plot, Sallust's Catilina of course
</p>
<p>makes the greatest contribution, and the characters are
</p>
<p>mainly developed in the way it suggests ; but the con-
</p>
<p>temporary works of Cicero, the Lives of Plutarch, and the
</p>
<p>accounts of Suetonius, Dio Cassius, and others are used
</p>
<p>freely. Into the dialogue many elements enter  speeches
</p>
<p>from Sallust ; one whole oration from Cicero, and excerpts
</p>
<p>from others ; figures from the Pharsalia of Lucan ; and
</p>
<p>single quotations from scattered sources  Florus, Claudian,
</p>
<p>and others. To the choruses Petronius Arbiter contri-
</p>
<p>butes most, as the first chorus is in large measure a trans-
</p>
<p>lation of the rhapsody of Eumolpus {Satiricon 119, 120) ;
</p>
<p>but another chorus, the fourth, owes greatly to Sallust,
</p>
<p>although not a mere translation.
</p>
<p>I. Sources of the Plot
</p>
<p>Sallust. No other one authoiity supplied so much to
</p>
<p>the plot of Catiline as the Catilina of Sallust. Sallust's
</p>
<p>real narrative commences with section 14. Beginning
</p>
<p>here, the next three sections paint Catiline's character,
</p>
<p>suggest that it was the memory of Sulla's former easy
</p>
<p>and profitable triumphs that animated him to rebellion
</p>
<p>(this is even more strongly hinted in section 5) , trace his
</p>
<p>crimes, and discover in them the unceasing scourges that
</p>
<p>drove him on to crimes still greater :
</p>
<p>The ills, that I haue done, cannot be safe
</p>
<p>But by attempting greater.

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Now, closely parallel to this in Jonson is the introduction
</p>
<p>of Sulla's ghost, the catalogue of Catiline's misdeeds, and
</p>
<p>Catiline's monologue containing the lines just quoted a-
</p>
<p>bove. Following this, Jonson introduces Aureha Orestilla,
</p>
<p>who has been mentioned by Sallust in section 15 ; and
</p>
<p>then comes the first meeting of the conspirators, both in
</p>
<p>Jonson and Sallust. To show at a glance how far Jonson

<p>the chief characters are drawn, Sempronia and Aureha
</p>
<p>Orestilla, Catihne, Lentulus, Cethegus, Curius, and Pe-
</p>
<p>treius are principally from his pages, although hints from
</p>
<p>other quarters are worked in. Many of the minor char-
</p>
<p>acters are not mentioned in any other account than the
</p>
<p>Catilina.
</p>
<p>Cicero. To fill in the outhne furnished by Sallust, Jon-
</p>
<p>son made heavy drafts on Cicero. However, these are
</p>
<p>generally in the dialogue, which I shall consider later.
</p>
<p>Practically the only part of the action taken from Cicero
</p>
<p>is the circumstantial account of the meeting of the senate
</p>
<p>(in act 5) at which the conspirators were convicted, which
</p>
<p>is from the third Catilinarian. However, the character
</p>
<p>of Cicero is due almost entirely to his self-revelations in
</p>
<p>his speeches, and the portrait of Catiline receives several
</p>
<p>effective touches from his hand.
</p>
<p>Plutarch, etc. The contribution of other authorities to
</p>
<p>the plot proper is, on the whole, negligible. Dio Cassius
</p>
<p>gives a description of prodigies that may not be imitated
</p>
<p>in Act I . Plutarch adds touches to the characters of Cat-
</p>
<p>iline and Lentulus, supplies the portrait of Antonius, and
</p>
<p>furnishes the basis for the letter-incident in Act 5, and for
</p>
<p>Cicero's personally leading the conspirators to execution.
</p>
<p>From Suetonius is the mention of the libel against Caesar
</p>
<p>in Act 5, and from him the character of Caesar seems to
</p>
<p>be principally drawn. However, the sum of these is
</p>
<p>but a small portion of the whole.
</p>
<p>2. Sources of the Dialogue
</p>
<p>Sallust. Sallust furnishes to the dialogue four of the
</p>
<p>five long connected speeches in Catiline : Catiline's ad-
</p>
<p>dress to the conspirators in Act i {Cat. 20), Catiline's
</p>
<p>speech to his soldiers in Act 5 {Cat. 58), and the speeches

<p>of Caesar and Cato in the senate on the punishment of the

<p>conspirators in Act 5 {Cat. 51 and 52). A number of

<p>shorter quotations also occur : Act i : 165169, 179 181,

</p>
<p>Cicero. One long speech is from Cicero  the oration
</p>
<p>against Catiline before the senate, in Act 4, taken from
</p>
<p>the first Catilinarian. Besides this, the following lines are
</p>
<p>either quoted from Cicero, or suggested by him :
</p>
<p>From I Cat. 3. 815-827; 4. 653-655

<p>Lucan and others. Jonson's borrowings from other
</p>
<p>sources are generally for 'atmosphere.' In describing
</p>
<p>the horrors, for instance, of Sulla's sway, which Catiline
</p>
<p>and his followers hope to see repeated, he goes to Lucan 's
</p>
<p>Pharsalia, where a vivid picture of civil strife is ready
</p>
<p>at hand, and incorporates many of its details in the
</p>
<p>account of the meeting of the conspirators in Act i.
</p>
<p>When Fulvia acquaints Cicero with the plot, in Act 3,
</p>
<p>Lucan supplies many of Cicero's exclamations of horror.
</p>
<p>He also furnishes part of Catihne's speech in the
</p>
<p>senate in Act 4, and figures for the description of
</p>
<p>Catiline's death in Act 5. Seneca furnishes several
</p>
<p>hints for the monologue of Sulla's ghost in the first

<p>act. Single quotations even appear from Petronius,

<p>Minor (5. 578) ; Floras' Epitome furnishes 3. 285288 and
</p>
<p>5. 688691 ; and Quintus Cicero is quoted in 4. 122126,
</p>
<p>Instances might be multiplied, but full references are given
</p>
<p>in the Notes,
</p>
<p>3. Sources of the Choruses
</p>
<p>Chorus I owes its flavor to the incorporation in it of
</p>
<p>some eight quotations from the Satiricon of Petronius.
</p>
<p>While the chorus is by no means entirely a translation,
</p>
<p>the parts not from Petronius are mainly but amplifications
</p>
<p>of his thought. Chorus 2 is largely Jonson's own, save
</p>
<p>for one hint from Horace ; Chorus 3 is also practically
</p>
<p>original. Chorus 4 contains only one direct quotation,
</p>
<p>but its gist is plainly taken from Sallust, with possibly
</p>
<p>some aid from Cicero's Pro Murena.
</p>
<p>The treatment I have here given the sources has been
</p>
<p>brief, because I shall have more to say about them in the
</p>
<p>next section and in one taking up Jonson as atranslator,

<p>The borrowings in Catiline are sometimes rather intan-

<p>gible. Scarcely more than a fourth of the play is actual
</p>
<p>translation, and yet scarcely more than a fourth is orig-
</p>
<p>inal. This is due to Jonson's method. Take, for in-
</p>
<p>stance, the first meeting of the senate in Act 5. Every in-
</p>
<p>cident is reproduced from Cicero's own account in 4 Cat., but
</p>
<p>there is practically no out-and-out quotation. Through-
</p>
<p>out, Jonson treats Sallust much as a modern play-

</p>
<p>novel, let us say. That is, he follows the outlines of the
</p>
<p>story pretty closely, taking dialogue where it is given, and
</p>
<p>where is it not, going to other sources, contemporary prefer-
</p>
<p>ably, to supply it. If he finds nothing definite there,
</p>
<p>he at least has learned enough to understand how his char-
</p>
<p>acters might speak. So in Catiline Sallust furnishes most
</p>
<p>of the plot, many of the character-studies, and a fair
</p>
<p>share of the speeches ; Cicero supplies much of the dia-
</p>
<p>logue directly, especially as a great part of his speeches
</p>
<p>in the play consists of mosaics from his works ; and the
</p>
<p>dialogue which is not directly furnished by Sallust, Cicero,
</p>
<p>or the minor sources, is almost always developed from
</p>
<p>them. The striking exception is the second act. For
</p>
<p>this Jonson had nothing but a few hints as to the cha-
</p>
<p>racter of Sempronia, and a bit from Ovid, and out of this
</p>
<p>scant stuff he wove one of the most sparkling of all his
</p>
<p>comic scenes. But this is unusual. Jonson 's aim is not
</p>
<p>to be original. He believes in sticking to his book, and
</p>
<p>as a result, although he gains in mechanical realism, he
</p>
<p>loses in dynamism. By reason of Jonson 's strict attention
</p>
<p>to sources, Catiline is a thoroughly Roman drama, far
</p>
<p>more so than Julius Ccesar : but who would ever consider
</p>
<p>comparing the two ? Despite Jonson's real power, the
</p>
<p>weight of pedanticism ties him down, and Catiline can
</p>
<p>never be said to soar.
</p>
<p>Jonson's attempts to be literally faithful to his author-
</p>
<p>ities sometimes lead him astray. I shall cite a few
</p>
<p>examples. In Act i, following the appearance of the
</p>
<p>ghost, and in direct accord with the atmosphere it has
</p>
<p>created, Catihne, in his monologue, seems just deciding
</p>
<p>to plot against his country. The phrase. It is decree'd,
</p>
<p>would indicate that a mental struggle, with the resolve
</p>
<p>to revolt as its culmination, has just ended. However,
</p>
<p>a few lines later, when the conspirators meet, Jonson has

</p>
<p>his eye upon Sallust so closely that he forgets this phrase,
</p>
<p>Literary Relationships xxiii
</p>
<p>and represents, with Sallust, the plot as aheady well ad-
</p>
<p>vanced. Again, Jonson for his own purposes desires to
</p>
<p>maintain a iictitious unity of time. But he forgets this
</p>
<p>also, when (again following Sallust) he calls upon Syllanus
</p>
<p>as Consul next designed, in Act 5, to give his judgment on
</p>
<p>the conspirators, notwithstanding that (as it seems to the
</p>
<p>reader) Cicero has just been elected to the consulship. ^
</p>
<p>Again, he translates a line from Cicero in Act 4 to make
</p>
<p>Gambinius Cimber the enginer of all ; but in his own account
</p>
<p>Cimber has been merely a figure-head. In an endeavor
</p>
<p>to reconcile Plutarch's and Sallust's accounts of the at-
</p>
<p>tempts to murder Cicero, the former crediting the whole
</p>
<p>to Cethegus, he uses them both. The same sort of thing
</p>
<p>occurs in Act 3 and Act 4, Catiline threatening (in both
</p>
<p>places) to quench opposition to him with fire and ruin ;
</p>
<p>in the first instance to Cato before the delivery of the
</p>
<p>first CatiUnarian, in the second instance to Caesar in an-
</p>
<p>swer to it. This is because Cicero in Pro Murena 25 and
</p>
<p>Sallust in Cat. 31 give different accounts. More instances
</p>
<p>of the sort might be adduced.
</p>
<p>5. Historical Accuracy of Catiline
</p>
<p>A strange anomaly in the case of Catiline is that, closely
</p>
<p>as it follows sources, it is not in the main true to history.
</p>
<p>This inaccuracy, however, is no fault of Jonson 's. He
</p>
<p>lived in an imcritical age. Sallust's account was undoub-
</p>
<p>tedly considered beyond reproach then, especially as
</p>
<p>Plutarch, Dio Cassius, Appian, Florus, and the other
</p>
<p>authorities agreed so substantially with it. But to us of to-
</p>
<p>day that very agreement is suspicious. As Merimee^
</p>
<p>points out, the accounts are so painstakingly ahke that

<p>xxiv Introduction
</p>
<p>the conjecture at once arises that they have all been
</p>
<p>drawn in the main from one common source. Then, too,
</p>
<p>Sallust and Plutarch, the two principal authorities, as
</p>
<p>Merimee further observes, were both stylists, fonder of
</p>
<p>beautiful phrases than of plain facts, Sallust, more-
</p>
<p>over, had cause to be prejudiced, as he was a violent par-
</p>
<p>tisan of Csesar. Indeed, Dr. Speck ^ considers the Cati-
</p>
<p>lina as nothing more than a campaign-document (' Partei-
</p>
<p>schrift') for Csesar. Plutarch is equally untrustworthy
</p>
<p>for another reason. In his Lives he always paints his
</p>
<p>characters in high hghts and deep shadows, striving for
</p>
<p>contrasts, and so brightens the virtues of Cicero and
</p>
<p>blackens the vices of Catiline.
</p>
<p>We have every reason to believe that Catiline, while
</p>
<p>certainly far from a 'model young man,' was not so bad
</p>
<p>as he has been depicted. Profligate he was, but profli-
</p>
<p>gacy was the gentlemanly vice of the age. Even the
</p>
<p>partial Plutarch admits his favorite Cato to have been
</p>
<p>entangled in adulterous liaisons. That Catiline murdered
</p>
<p>his son, forced a vestal, or corrupted his daughter, would
</p>
<p>seem to be improbable, in view of the fact that he was
</p>
<p>twice 2 able to stand for the consulship. He had been
</p>
<p>rather closely connected with the regime of Sulla, but
</p>
<p>many noteworthy citizens had also taken part in its
</p>
<p>horrors : a highly developed sense of mercy and pity was
</p>
<p>not a common Roman attribute. Above all, he was
</p>
<p>ambitious : but so was Caesar ; and there is no evidence that
</p>
<p>Catiline was any more ambitious or unscrupulous than he.
</p>
<p>I hold no brief for Catihne . His course was doubtless per-
</p>
<p>nicious, and he had in him over  much of the demagogue ;
</p>
<p>yet I do think that he was no unusual monster, but merely
</p>
<p>a logical product of his age. The seeds of decadence
</p>
<p>had long been sown, and Catihne was one of the first-

<p>fruits. He was but the natural link between Marius and
</p>
<p>Sulla on the one hand, andCsesar and Augustus on the other.
</p>
<p>There were real abuses in Rome, many of them glaring,
</p>
<p>and the steadily increasing concentration of wealth had
</p>
<p>produced a deep unrest and a growing protest for more
</p>
<p>equal distribution. Especially did there seem to be in-
</p>
<p>justice in the debtors' laws, which, we are led to believe,
</p>
<p>lay heavily upon Catiline himself, until his fortunate
</p>
<p>union with the rich Aurelia relieved him. Smarting from
</p>
<p>real or fancied personal wrongs, and fired with ambition,
</p>
<p>Catiline readily mistook his own cause for that of the
</p>
<p>public  a mental procedure by no means without
</p>
<p>parallel. By nature he was peculiarly fitted to be the
</p>
<p>leader of a discontented faction. All authorities, even
</p>
<p>Cicero, agree as to the dignity of his birth, his rare in-
</p>
<p>tellectual equipment, and the persuasive charm of his
</p>
<p>personality. At first, his intentions were to seek reform
</p>
<p>through legitimate channels. He offered himself for the
</p>
<p>consulship twice, and his second candidacy seemed sure
</p>
<p>of success. However, a very unusual turn of circum-
</p>
<p>stances, an unexpected combination of interests, defeated
</p>
<p>him, although it carried in Antonius, whom he had
</p>
<p>planned to have as colleague. The other new consul,
</p>
<p>Cicero, was a man of great abilities, but, as Ferrero
</p>
<p>terms him, a ' notorious political trimmer '  a professional
</p>
<p>advocate, not over-consistent in his acceptance of cases,
</p>
<p>who had even numbered Catiline among his clients.
</p>
<p>Further, he was of mean birth, a novus homo. This
</p>
<p>defeat was too much for the proud patrician Catiline,
</p>
<p>and he at once set on foot plans for an active revolution,
</p>
<p>which he seems to have thought could be rather easily
</p>
<p>accomplished. Cicero, however, inordinately vain of his
</p>
<p>new honor, and desirous at all costs of making a name
</p>
<p>for himself, forced the hand of Catihne. In a fiery

</p>
<p>speech in the senate he brought to bear all the tricks
</p>
<p>xxvi Introduction
</p>
<p>of his consummate oratory, with the result that Catiline,
</p>
<p>finding his backers stupefied into silence, was forced to
</p>
<p>leave the city. There is but little doubt that Cicero had
</p>
<p>slight positive evidence against Catiline when he delivered
</p>
<p>this speech. There is even a grave suspicion that some
</p>
<p>of its charges were invented for the occasion ; for Cicero
</p>
<p>was a wily politician, as is shown by his display at one
</p>
<p>time of his gorget, to create the impression that his
</p>
<p>life was in danger. However, the oration served its
</p>
<p>purpose, Catiline departed, and Cicero daily grew in
</p>
<p>favor with the people.
</p>
<p>Like all popular leaders, Catiline had a motley crowd
</p>
<p>for a following  men with all manner of grievances, agreed
</p>
<p>in nothing save that they were malcontents. As long
</p>
<p>as he was personally in Rome, he was able in a measure
</p>
<p>to curb his subordinates, and to preserve at least a
</p>
<p>factitious unity in his party. Once he was away, how-
</p>
<p>ever, things became chaotic. That portion of his follow-
</p>
<p>ers dominated by the hot-headed Cethegus and the
</p>
<p>credulous Lentulus, whom the purple lure of empire
</p>
<p>had made mad, decided on strenuous measures. The
</p>
<p>slaves were to rise, the senate was to be slaughtered, the
</p>
<p>city to be fired (possibly it was Cicero's charges that
</p>
<p>first inspired some of these plans). Of course, the result
</p>
<p>was inevitable, Catiline was not yet prepared for open
</p>
<p>war ; but the incredible stupidity of his adherents in
</p>
<p>attempting to tamper with Rome's allies, the AUobroges,
</p>
<p>and the consequent discovery, compelled him to trust
</p>
<p>to the fortunes of battle. The outcome is well known.
</p>
<p>The view I here take of Catiline's conspiracy is sub-
</p>
<p>stantially that of Ferrero, Merimee, and Speck. That
</p>
<p>Catiline was bad I admit, but one must give even the
</p>
<p>devil his due. To the stories as to CatiHne's former
</p>
<p>conspiracy, in which Crassus and Caesar were alleged to

</p>
<p>be implicated, and which I have mentioned in my Notes
</p>
<p>Literary Relationships xxvii
</p>
<p>as part of the current gossip, I give no credence. Not
</p>
<p>only the evil that men do lives after them, but much that
</p>
<p>they never even thought of doing. Catihne had the
</p>
<p>misfortune to have two prejudiced biographers, and has
</p>
<p>suffered unjustly in consequence. However, as I re-
</p>
<p>marked before, we cannot blame Jonson for accepting the
</p>
<p>authorities he found, because his was an uncritical age.
</p>
<p>But it is a cruel paradox that this tragedy, on which such
</p>
<p>vast pains were spent for absolute accuracy, should be,
</p>
<p>after all, so largely mistaken.
</p>
<p>6. Jonson as a Translator
</p>
<p>'Drummond was right when he wrote, "Above all
</p>
<p>things he (Jonson) excelleth in a Translation." As his
</p>
<p>two tragedies show . . . the thing he could do supremely
</p>
<p>well was to turn the lifelessness of the classics into terms
</p>
<p>of contemporary vitality. In the best sense of the word,
</p>
<p>no better translator ever lived : he never forgot that
</p>
<p>faithfulness to his original is only half the task of the
</p>
<p>translator, who adds only to the dead weight of printed
</p>
<p>matter if he fail to bear to living men, in living language,
</p>
<p>tidings that without him were to them unmeaning ' (Bar-
</p>
<p>rett Wendell, in Library of World's Best Literature, vol. 14).
</p>
<p>With this criticism I heartily agree. So, also, in the
</p>
<p>main, does Miss Wright in her unpublished thesis which
</p>
<p>I have several times mentioned. Indeed, Miss Wright's
</p>
<p>criticism of Jonson's translations is so lucid and so
</p>
<p>capable that it would be supererogatory for me to add
</p>
<p>to it ; so I shall reproduce the main portion of it here.
</p>
<p>'Let us turn now to a particular consideration of
</p>
<p>the method employed by Jonson in rendering Sallust
</p>
<p>and Cicero into Elizabethan English, and the success
</p>
<p>with which he accomplished his task. Let us take two
</p>
<p>speeches, one from Sallust and one from Cicero, on which
</p>

</p>
<p>to base our study, in which we must have in mind the
</p>
<p>xxviii Introduction
</p>
<p>two points of view from which every translation should
</p>
<p>be judged. We must observe, first, in what way and how
</p>
<p>successfully the translation preserves the diction and
</p>
<p>sense of the original,  whether diction is sacrificed to
</p>
<p>sense, or sense to diction, or whether both or neither have
</p>
<p>been effectively kept. In the second place, the trans-
</p>
<p>lation must be judged, with no regard to its origin, as
</p>
<p>a piece of English composition.
</p>
<p>'In comparing Jonson's version of Catiline's address
</p>
<p>to the conspirators with that speech as found in Sallust's
</p>
<p>Catiline 20, the first point to be noticed is the number
</p>
<p>and nature of his original insertions, which are not intro-
</p>
<p>duced for the sake of adding any new thought, but for
</p>
<p>the sake of developing and emphasizing the thought
</p>
<p>already expressed in Sallust. The best example of such
</p>
<p>an insertion for emphasis is the one introduced between
</p>
<p>I. 394 and 405, where Jonson seems inspired by Catiline's
</p>
<p>indignation at the arrogance and extravagance of the
</p>
<p>Roman potentates to break away from his model, and
</p>
<p>to pile up accusation after accusation against the offen-
</p>
<p>ders, concluding with one of the most forcible and striking
</p>
<p>figures of the play :
</p>
<p>We, all this while, like calme, benum'd Spectators,
</p>
<p>Sit, till our seates doe cracke ; and doe not heare
</p>
<p>The thundring mines.
</p>
<p>Another example of a passage inserted for the sake of
</p>
<p>making the point more emphatic is found in the trans-
</p>
<p>lation of Sallust's " vulgus fuimus," which Jonson renders :
</p>
<p>Are hearded with the vulgar ; and so kept.
</p>
<p>As we were onley bred, to consume corne ;
</p>
<p>Or weare out wooU ; to drinke the cities water.
</p>
<p>Many of Jonson's original Hnes were brought in to make
</p>
<p>clear the transition of thought between two sentences,

</p>
<p>the connection between which would not have been
</p>
<p>Literary Relationships xxix
</p>
<p>sufficiently brought out by a literal translation. Lines
</p>
<p>345346 are a good example of this kind of insertion.
</p>
<p>In lines 352-353.
</p>
<p>The riches of the world flowes to their coffers
</p>
<p>And not to Romes,
</p>
<p>what has been said in the preceding five lines is summar-
</p>
<p>ized, and the main idea emphasized, in a manner which
</p>
<p>gives the necessary clearness and completeness to the
</p>
<p>thought.
</p>
<p>'Besides taking such pains to bring out clearly the
</p>
<p>point of thought, Jonson also strives, by the addition of
</p>
<p>metaphors and figurative language, to make it forcible
</p>
<p>and poetic. His most successful attempt thus to beautify
</p>
<p>some prosaic statement is in his translation of Sallust's,
</p>
<p>"his obnoxii quibus, si respublica valeret, formidini
</p>
<p>essemus," which he translates,
</p>
<p>Trembhng beneath their rods : to whom, (if all
</p>
<p>Were well in Rome) we should come forth bright axes.
</p>
<p>Other figurative translations are :
</p>
<p>"potentinm"  the giants of the state. (348)
</p>
<p>" quis mortalium toUere potest"  It doth strike my soule. (374)
</p>
<p>"divitias superare"  Swell with treasure. (377)
</p>
<p>" divitiae, decus, gloria in oculis sita sunt"^
</p>
<p>Behold, renowne, riches and glory court you (411), etc.
</p>
<p>'But Jonson's method of translation in general can
</p>
<p>be best shown by a word-for-word comparison of some
</p>
<p>connected passage in Catiline with the passage correspon-
</p>
<p>ding to it in Sallust. Let us take, for example, the
</p>
<p>first ten lines of the speech. The first sentence of this
</p>
<p>in Sallust is as follows :
</p>
<p>Ni virtus fidesque vestra spectata mihi forent, nequidquam
</p>
<p>opportuna res cecidisset ; spes magna, dominatio, in manibus
</p>
<p>frustra fuissent ; neque ego per ignaviam, aut vana ingenia,

</p>
<p>incerta pro certis captarem.
</p>
<p>XXX Introduction
</p>
<p>The first clause, "Ni virtus fidesque vestra spectata
</p>
<p>mihi forent," is translated by Jonson :
</p>
<p>Noblest Romanes,
</p>
<p>If you were lesse, or that your faith, and vertue
</p>
<p>Did not hold good that title with your bloud.
</p>
<p>This is certainly the freest sort of translation. The sense
</p>
<p>of the clause is kept, but only two words, "virtus fides-
</p>
<p>que," are translated literally. The address. Noblest Ro-
</p>
<p>manes, and the ingenious play on the word nohle are ori-
</p>
<p>ginal, and the latter adds new suggestion to the original
</p>
<p>idea, though it must be admitted that the expression is
</p>
<p>a bit obscure.
</p>
<p>'The next two clauses, "nequidquam opportuna res
</p>
<p>cecidisset ; spes magna, dominatio, in manibus frustra
</p>
<p>fuissent," are rendered by Jonson so freely that the
</p>
<p>result can be called translation only in the broadest sense
</p>
<p>of the word. He has gathered up the meaning of the
</p>
<p>clauses, and expressed it in a very general way, when
</p>
<p>he says,
</p>
<p>I should not, now, vnprofitably spend
</p>
<p>Myselfe in words,
</p>
<p>in which the word vfiprofitahly carries the whole point
</p>
<p>of Sallust's meaning.
</p>
<p>'The last clause of the sentence follows Sallust more
</p>
<p>closely, but is still quite free. Sallust had said, "neque
</p>
<p>ego per ignaviam aut vana ingenia, incerta pro certis
</p>
<p>captarem" and Jonson translates this:
</p>
<p>Or catch at empty hopes
</p>
<p>By ayrie ways, for solide certainties;
</p>
<p>in which sentence, catch at translates "captarem;" hy
</p>
<p>ayrie ways, "per ignaviam aut vana ingenia;" empty
</p>
<p>hopes, "incerta" ; and for solide certainties, "pro certis."

</p>
<p>In these five lines, surely, Jonson has effectually dis-
</p>
<p>Literary Relationships xxxi
</p>
<p>proved Professor Herford's statement^ that Jonson's trans-
</p>
<p>lations were characterized by 'rigid fidehty.'
</p>
<p>'It is, however, true that most of Jonson's work is
</p>
<p>not so notably free as the passage given above. The
</p>
<p>next five lines, which follow the original a httle more
</p>
<p>closely, and yet with no slavish subservience to the form
</p>
<p>in which the Latin expresses itself, are more typical of
</p>
<p>Jonson's average work. The first clause of the sentence
</p>
<p>is characteristic of Jonson's style of translation where he
</p>
<p>follows Sallust more closely: "Sed quia multis et
</p>
<p>magnis tempestatibus, vos cognovi fortes fidesque  "
</p>
<p>But since in many, and the greatest dangers
</p>
<p>I still haue knowne you no lesse true, then vaUant 
</p>
<p>a faithful translation, but expressed in such easy and
</p>
<p>rhythmical English that the adjective "rigid" could
</p>
<p>certainly not be applied to it. The rest of the passage :
</p>
<p>eo animus ausus maximum atque pulcherimum facinus
</p>
<p>incipere ; simul, quia vobis eadem, quae mihi, bona malaque
</p>
<p>intellexi ; nam idem velle atque nolle, ea demum firma ami-
</p>
<p>citia est
</p>
<p>is translated :
</p>
<p>And that I tast, in you, the same affections
</p>
<p>To will or nill, to thinke things good, or bad.
</p>
<p>Alike with me : (which argues your firme friendship)
</p>
<p>I dare the boldlier, with you, set on foot.
</p>
<p>Or leade, vnto this great, and goodliest action.
</p>
<p>Here Jonson has cleverly changed the order, and woven
</p>
<p>together the more or less disconnected clauses of the
</p>
<p>original into a compact whole, while he has rendered the
</p>
<p>Latin into flowing and forceful Enghsh in a manner
</p>
<p>which gives an accurate rendering of the thought and
</p>
<p>feehng of the original, and yet does not allow itself to be
</p>
<p>trammeled by a too conscientious fidehty.

<p>xxxii Introduction
</p>
<p>'Comparing Jonson's translation as a whole with
</p>
<p>Sallust's version of the speech of Catiline, we find, then,
</p>
<p>that he has brought out Sallust's ideas clearly, emphat-
</p>
<p>ically, and accurately. His work is characterized by an
</p>
<p>ease and smoothness not found in Sallust's succession of
</p>
<p>short, abrupt sentences. It nowhere degenerates into
</p>
<p>a servile word-for-word rendering of the original, and is
</p>
<p>dominated throughout by spirit and energy.
</p>
<p>'Now it is a strange fact that, although a close com-
</p>
<p>parison of the kind which we have just made will prove
</p>
<p>Jonson's translations to be remarkably free, a hasty
</p>
<p>reading without such comparison is likely to leave the
</p>
<p>impression that they are slavishly literal  a fact which
</p>
<p>no doubt explains the cause of so many really unjust
</p>
<p>criticisms. This is due to a certain peculiarity in Jon-
</p>
<p>son's style, which I shall now try to illustrate and explain
</p>
<p>by a comparison of Cicero's speech in the Senate with
</p>
<p>its original in the first Catilinarian. The peculiarity
</p>
<p>to which I refer is the frequency of Latinisms, or the
</p>
<p>use of derivatives or equivalents of Latin words in their
</p>
<p>native, not their English, sense.
</p>
<p>' In order to illustrate what I mean in my comparison
</p>
<p>of Jonson and Cicero, I shall not be able, as in the speech
</p>
<p>just discussed, to use one connected passage for detailed
</p>
<p>analysis, but shall be compelled to base my conclusions
</p>
<p>on a selection of the sentences in which this characteristic
</p>
<p>is most strikingly brought out. In the six following
</p>
<p>clauses, it will be noticed that each of the chief words
</p>
<p>is used in the distinctly Latin meaning of the word
</p>
<p>which it translates, and that this gives an effect of rather
</p>
<p>servile following of the Latin. The phrase in Jonson's
</p>
<p>rendering, Speake, and this shall conuince thee is a
</p>
<p>free translation of Cicero's "convincam, si negas,"
</p>
<p>in which Jonson's convince is a Latinism for "convict."

</p>
<p>Aske my counsell, I perswade it, translates " Si me
</p>
<p>Literary Relationships xxxiii
</p>
<p>consulis, suadeo." What domesticke note Of priuate
</p>
<p>filthinesse translates " Quae nota domesticae turpitud-
</p>
<p>inis," where the word note is made to carry the meaning
</p>
<p>of the Latin word "nota," "a brand." In the phrase,
</p>
<p>Who Of such a frequency, translating "quis ex hac
</p>
<p>tanta frequentia," the word frequency means, like the
</p>
<p>Latin "frequentia," "a crowd." So much consent is
</p>
<p>a translation of "tantam consensionem," "so much una-
</p>
<p>nimity"; and in the sentence, All shall he cleere, made
</p>
<p>plaine, oppres'd, reueng'd, a comparison with the Latin
</p>
<p>"omnia patefacta illustrata, oppressa, vindicata esse
</p>
<p>videatis" shows that the word oppressed really means
</p>
<p>"suppressed", as does the Latin "oppressa."
</p>
<p>' Now this is the kind of translation that the ordinary
</p>
<p>schoolboy is apt to make, on account, perhaps, of a
</p>
<p>lack of vocabulary, or an inherent indisposition to take
</p>
<p>the trouble to think up the exact word ; and Jonson has
</p>
<p>received no little abuse because of it. A glance through
</p>
<p>the pages of Catiline will show, however, that these
</p>
<p>Latinisms are used not only in translations, but also
</p>
<p>frequently throughout the play. His Sejanus, too, is
</p>
<p>full of them. But it will also be noticed that they are
</p>
<p>used comparatively rarely in his comedies. The frequent
</p>
<p>use of a peculiar diction throughout two plays, and a
</p>
<p>rare use of it elsewhere, would seem to indicate a special
</p>
<p>purpose for its introduction in those particular instances.
</p>
<p>And undoubtedly Jonson had such a purpose. Just
</p>
<p>as we saw, in studying his treatment of the recorded
</p>
<p>facts of the conspiracy, what pains he took to produce on
</p>
<p>his hearers exactly the effect which would have been
</p>
<p>produced on them by reading Sallust or Cicero, so now
</p>
<p>we see this same idea showing itself in his method of
</p>
<p>translation. His appeal in each case is to the reader
</p>
<p>extraordinary, who is familiar with Sallust and Cicero,

</p>
<p>in whose mind he hopes the Anglicized Latin words will
</p>
<p>xxxiv Introduction
</p>
<p>rouse the memories and associations connected with
</p>
<p>their Latin use. Relying on the subtle suggestiveness
</p>
<p>which all these words contain, on account of their inti-
</p>
<p>mate connection in our minds with the thoughts and
</p>
<p>literature of ancient Rome, he strives to bring us back as
</p>
<p>uearly as possible into the spirit and atmosphere of the
</p>
<p>w^rld of Catiline and Cicero. Jonson's purpose is the
</p>
<p>sarn>p as that of certain writers who, in picturing scenes
</p>
<p>of days gone by, make their characters speak in quaint
</p>
<p>and stilted language, to give a flavor of reality. The
</p>
<p>weakness in this method is that it produces the required
</p>
<p>illusion only in those who are very familiar with the
</p>
<p>Latin language. The uninitiated, thinking that the
</p>
<p>words are used in their customary sense, find them often
</p>
<p>unmeaning in the connection in which they occur, and
</p>
<p>sometimes even inconsistent. A striking example of
</p>
<p>this is found in the first sentence of Jonson's translation
</p>
<p>of Catiline's speech to the conspirators. There he trans-
</p>
<p>lates the Latin "virtus"  meaning "courage," "capa-
</p>
<p>bility"  by its Enghsh derivative, "virtue." The reader
</p>
<p>in ordinarie, taking the word in its accustomed English
</p>
<p>sense, wonders that it should be used to describe a band
</p>
<p>of men to whom no quality could have been less appro-
</p>
<p>priately attributed. And here I must mention another
</p>
<p>thing that Jonson does less frequently, but with the
</p>
<p>same purpose; namely, the introduction now and then
</p>
<p>into his play of a word-for-word translation of some
</p>
<p>Latin idiom. In 4. 823, for instance, Cicero says.
</p>
<p>My vertue
</p>
<p>(Will) glad me, doing well, though I heare ill,
</p>
<p>the last two words of which are a literal rendering of the
</p>
<p>Latin idiom, "audire male," "to be ill spoken of." In
</p>
<p>I. 416, vse me your generall translates "imperatore me

</p>

<p>Literary Relationships xxxv
</p>
<p>tive to me, as in the Latin clause, Jonson speaks of
</p>
<p>this one CATILINE (4. 444) instead of saying "Catiline
</p>
<p>alone," as if he were translating the Latin " unus Catilina " ;
</p>
<p>and when he wishes to say that something is inconsistent
</p>
<p>with something else, he uses the expression abhorring
</p>
<p>from (5. 479), evidently having in mind the Latin con-
</p>
<p>struction "abhorrens ab."
</p>
<p>'It can easily be seen how a superficial critic, not
</p>
<p>noticing that these Latinisms and Latin idioms are used
</p>
<p>in the original parts of Jonson 's play, as well as in the
</p>
<p>translations, nor realizing the purpose for which they
</p>
<p>were introduced, might consider them the earmarks of
</p>
<p>uninspired renderings.'
</p>
<p>7. Jonson's Debt to Seneca
</p>
<p>In many ways we must call Catiline a Senecan tragedy.
</p>
<p>It is certainly not tragedy exactly such as Seneca wrote,
</p>
<p>but it would seem that Jonson certainly believed he was
</p>
<p>reproducing Senecan traditions. The play opens with the
</p>
<p>familiar Senecan ghost, introduced with much the same
</p>
<p>purpose as the overture to a Wagnerian opera. There is
</p>
<p>the Senecan dearth of rapid movement, although Catiline
</p>
<p>has considerably more real progression than is usual with
</p>
<p>Seneca. Further, the hero (if we way call him such) is a
</p>
<p>thoroughly depraved character, not at all resembling the
</p>
<p>Greek tragic heroes : and such a hero and his career of
</p>
<p>crime are what Seneca delights to portray. The long
</p>
<p>dialogues, full of sententice (such as The vicious count
</p>
<p>their y ceres, vertuous their acts, etc.), the choruses having
</p>
<p>no connection with the dramatic action, and the use of
</p>
<p>portents, as if Nature reflected man's moods, are also
</p>
<p>thoroughly Senecan. However, it is in the character
</p>
<p>of Catiline that Seneca's influence shows most plainly,
</p>
<p>Catihne in Sallust is immensely practical, and never works

<p>himself up into such frenzies of rage and hate, in which
</p>
<p>xxxvi Introduction
</p>
<p>he breathes out fire and slaughter against all who oppose
</p>
<p>him, as Jonson has him do, for instance, in the furious
</p>
<p>rant of 4. 640658. The character of Cethegus is also
</p>
<p>quite after Seneca's manner. A final and convincing
</p>
<p>proof that Jonson had an eye to Seneca is the imitation
</p>
<p>of Thyestes in the very opening lines of Catiline.^
</p>
<p>8. Catiline in the Drama
</p>
<p>Catiline has been a much more ancient and popular
</p>
<p>dramatic figure than has been commonly supposed.
</p>
<p>Even before the appearance in 1470 of the editio princeps
</p>
<p>of Sallust, there was performed at Florence the Istoria
</p>
<p>Fiorentina of Ricordano Malespinis, a dramatic chronicle
</p>
<p>beginning with Adam, and including such other well-
</p>
<p>known mythological characters as Electra, Dardanus, Her-
</p>
<p>cules, etc. The thirteenth section of this rather monumen-
</p>
<p>tal performance treated of Catiline and 'della congiura,
</p>
<p>che fe Catellino con certi Romani.' From all reports,
</p>
<p>however, Malespinis' treatment of history was, to say
</p>
<p>the least, highly fanciful, as Attila ( !) plays a prominent
</p>
<p>part in the plot.^
</p>
<p>Preceding Ben Jonson 's play came at least two Eng-
</p>
<p>lish Catiline-dramas. About 1578 Stephen Gosson pro-
</p>
<p>duced Catillins Conspiracies, a tragedy. Gosson was
</p>
<p>a sturdy Puritan, and put out a tract against the stage.
</p>
<p>The School of Abuse, in 1579. However, as he says in
</p>
<p>that pamphlet, tragedies are 'toUerable at sometjmie,'
</p>
<p>and this one, 'a Pig of myne owne Sowe' as he styles
</p>
<p>it, he frankly confesses to be of that sort. This play
</p>
<p>is unfortunately lost, as is also another, mentioned in
</p>
<p>Mr. Henslowe's MSS., Catiline's Conspiracy, by Robert
</p>
<p>^ See Notes.

<p>Wilson and Harry Chettle, acted in 1598. As Gifford
</p>
<p>ably argues, however, Jonson's use of original authorities

<p>anything to either of these productions.

<p>personally to examine only those by Crebillon, Voltaire,
</p>
<p>Literary Relationships xxxix
</p>
<p>Croly, and Dumas-Maquet. None of these hae much in
</p>
<p>common with Jonson, nor, indeed, with history. In Cre-
</p>
<p>billon's drama, Cicero is so far entrapped by Catihne's wiles
</p>
<p>as to entrust him with a command in the army ; and at
</p>
<p>the end, Catihne commits suicide in the temple of Tellus,
</p>
<p>in company with Cicero's daughter Tullia, whom he
</p>
<p>loves. In Voltaire's play, Aureha is a lovable woman,
</p>
<p>totally ignorant of Catiline's baseness, who dies from a
</p>
<p>broken heart on discovering in her husband the murderer
</p>
<p>of her father and the betrayer of his country ; and the
</p>
<p>denouement is brought about by Caesar, who, refusing
</p>
<p>to join the conspirators, commands in the battle that
</p>
<p>subdues them. In Croly 's production (quite a readable
</p>
<p>one, by the way), Catiline is at first well-meaning, but
</p>
<p>is urged on by his wife, who somewhat resembles Lady
</p>
<p>Macbeth ; in the final scene, Catiline dies just as he has
</p>
<p>been informed that his troops have swept all before them.
</p>
<p>In the joint work by Dumas-Maquet  a very spirited
</p>
<p>and rapid piece, but wildly romantic  the prologue pre-
</p>
<p>sents Catiline's rape of a vestal ; later, Cicero plans to
</p>
<p>murder Catiline for the good of Rome, and Catiline is saved,
</p>
<p>just in the nick of time, by Charinus, his newly found son
</p>
<p>by the vestal ; Cicero wins his election to the consulship
</p>
<p>through a rank fraud performed by Fulvia, who loves
</p>
<p>him ; Aureha, a veritable devil, discovering the existence
</p>
<p>of Charinus, kills him, and pours his blood into the
</p>
<p>pledge-cup of the conspirators ; and Catiline, on discov-
</p>
<p>ering this horrible deed, takes his Ufe.

</p>
<p>medizinischen Anschauungen der Renaissancezeit be-
</p>
<p>ruhende Theorie der Charaktere, die der sogenannten
</p>
<p>"humours", worunter das einseitige Hervortreten einer
</p>
<p>Eigenschaft zu verstehen ist. Dies macht sich auch
</p>
<p>im Katilina bis in die Nebenpersonen hinein bemerkbar.
</p>
<p>Katilina ist immer und iiberall der gleiche energische,
</p>
<p>wild auf sein Ziel losstiirmende Gewaltmensch, eine
</p>
<p>Entwicklung und Steigerung findet kaum statt. Cethe-
</p>
<p>gus ist stets der Draufganger, Lentulus kommt immer
</p>
<p>und immer wieder mit seiner Weissagung und seinem
</p>
<p>Aberglauben, selbst den Allobrogern tischt er ihn auf.
</p>
<p>Sempronia fiihrt unausgesetzt ihr Griechisch im Munde,
</p>
<p>und Cicero halt lange Reden, wo er geht und steht.
</p>
<p>Es ist aber nicht gerechtfertigt das so scharf zu tadeln,
</p>
<p>wie Sagelken es tut, denn jede Stilisierung  und auf
</p>
<p>eine solche geht Jonson offenbar aus  beruht auf einer
</p>
<p>Herausarbeitung des Wesentlichen unter Auslassung des
</p>
<p>Nebensachlichen und tut somit in gewissem Sinne der
</p>
<p>Natur Gewalt an. Da es dem Dichter zudem in Komo-
</p>
<p>die wie Tragodie auf eine Darstellung von Typen und all-
</p>
<p>gemeinen Zustanden ankam, so erscheint sein Verfahren
</p>
<p>ganz richtig. Auch darf man nicht vergessen, dass die
</p>
<p>Charaktere durch diese Vereinfachung an Wucht und Ge-
</p>
<p>walt gewinnen, was sie an naturalistischer Lebenswahr-
</p>
<p>heit verlieren.
</p>
<p>'Katilina erscheint denn auch bei Jonson als eine
</p>
<p>ins Riesenhafte gesteigerte Verbrechematur, deren Be-
</p>
<p>rechtigung eben, wie schon in der Einleitung hervor-
</p>
<p>gehoben wurde, in der iiberwaltigenden Macht ihres Auf-
</p>
<p>tretens liegt. Dabei hat der Dichter eigentlich nichts

</p>
<p>macht sich mit seinen vielen schonen Reden fast etwas
</p>
<p>lacherlich, Kato und Katulus werden zu ziemlich farb-

</p>
<p>sehr wiirdige Benehmen von Casar und Krassus dient

<p>nur dazu, um die Partei der Verschworer, die die reichste
</p>
<p>Mannigfaltigkeit an kraftvollen Charakteren aufweist,
</p>
<p>in ein giinstigeres Licht zu setzen.
</p>
<p>'Ausserdem wird Katilina noch mit allerhand sym-

<p>Gattin, mit iiberlegener Klugheit und Menschenkenntnis,
</p>
<p>unglaublicher Energie und unbeugsamem Trotze aus-

<p>gestattet, und schliesslich loscht sein heldenhafter Tod,
</p>
<p>nachdem er mit grosster Tapferkeit bis zum letzten
</p>
<p>Atemzuge gekampft, viele von seinen friiheren Schand-

<p>taten aus. Katilina ist also ein Verbrecher aus Ehr-

</p>
<p>des marques de perspicacite et d'energie.'  H. A. Taine.
</p>
<p>Histoire de la Litter ature Anglaise, 2. 107  8.
</p>
<p>'Catiline is an historical tragedy of exceptionable
</p>
<p>merit ; save for the fortuitous interest which the problem
</p>
<p>of the character of Tiberius excites in Sejanus, the later ^
</p>
<p>must be pronounced the superior play. Consummate
</p>
<p>is the portraiture of conspirators braggart Cethegus ;
</p>
<p>Lentulus, voluptuary and dreamer ; savage and des-
</p>
<p>perate Catiline ; and skillful is the contrast of these with
</p>
<p>prudent Cato and with Cicero, eloquent to the verge of
</p>
<p>garruhty and appreciative of his own abilities and
</p>
<p>achievements to a point that halts just short of comedy.
</p>
<p>But if Jonson's fidelity to the greater portraits of history
</p>
<p>is worthy of praise, not less admirable is the effect which
</p>
<p>he has contrived to produce in representing to us, with a

<p>vividness which only the stage can attain, the social
</p>
<p>life of ancient Rome. The scenes in which figure the
</p>
<p>fickle, wanton Fulvia, and Sempronia, vain of her
</p>
<p>knowledge of Greek and ambitious to be dabbling in
</p>
<p>politics, are second to nothing in the satirical high com-
</p>
<p>edy that the age has left us.
</p>
<p>'But there is yet another aspect in which Jonson's
</p>
<p>later Roman tragedy deserves serious attention. Cat-
</p>
<p>iline is alike the final expression of Jonson's theories as
</p>
<p>to English tragedy and one of the most successful among
</p>
<p>English tragedies modeled on ancient dramatic theories
</p>
<p>and ideals. For although Jonson, be it reaffirmed, was
</p>
<p>no supine classicist, but believed, to use his own words,
</p>
<p>that "we should enjoy the same license or free power
</p>
<p>to illustrate and heighten our invention as the ancients
</p>
<p>did ; and not be tied to those strict and regular forms,
</p>
<p>which the niceness of a few  who are nothing but form 
</p>
<p>would thrust upon us " ; ^ yet Catiline shows, as compared
</p>
<p>with Sejanus, a retrogression to earlier ideals and a
</p>
<p>stricter regard for the minor practices if not the larger
</p>
<p>spirit of Seneca. Thus the drama opens with an Induc-
</p>
<p>tion in which figures the ghost of Sylla ; and lyrical
</p>
<p>choruses in a variety of metres interlard the acts. But
</p>
<p>these, as Gifford put it, are "spoken by no one, and
</p>
<p>addressed to no one, "^ and, although at times of great
</p>
<p>literary excellence, are absolutely inorganic. Catiline
</p>
<p>with its historical portraiture, its consummate dramatic
</p>
<p>dialogue and constructive excellence, is no Senecan
</p>
<p>drama. That Jonson should have fallen short of ab-
</p>
<p>solute success in these Roman tragedies of his mature
</p>
<p>years is wholly due neither to the defects in his theory
</p>
<p>nor to his limitations as an author. The trend of the

<p>age was against such art, as the trend of our age is against
</p>
<p>it. And when Swinburne dubs Sejanus "a magnificent
</p>
<p>mistake" and esteems Catiline as valuable alone for its
</p>
<p>proof "that Jonson could do better, but not much better,
</p>
<p>on the same rigid lines, "^ with due respect for the super-
</p>
<p>lative powers of a great poet, we must keep in mind that
</p>
<p>we have rhapsodic and impressionistic art for the nonce
</p>
<p>arrayed in judicial robes and sitting in judgment on all,
</p>
<p>in short, that it is not.'  F. E. Schelling. Elizabethan
</p>
<p>Drama 2. 33  35.
</p>
<p>'The tragedy of Catiline his Conspiracy gave evidence
</p>
<p>in the following year that the author of Sejanus could
</p>
<p>do better, but could not do much better, on the same
</p>
<p>rigid hues of rhetorical and studious work which he had
</p>
<p>followed in the earlier play.^ Fine as is the opening of
</p>
<p>this too laborious tragedy, the stately verse has less
</p>
<p>of dramatic movement than of such as might be proper 
</p>
<p>if such a thing could be  for epic satire cast into the
</p>
<p>form of dialogue. Catiline is so mere a monster of
</p>
<p>ravenous malignity and irrational atrocity that he
</p>
<p>simply impresses us as an irresponsible though criminal
</p>
<p>lunatic : and there is something so preposterous, so
</p>
<p>abnormal, in the conduct and language of all concerned
</p>
<p>in his conspiracy, that nothing attributed to them
</p>
<p>seems either rationally credible or logically incredible.
</p>
<p>Coleridge, in his notes on the first act of this play, ex-
</p>
<p>presses his conviction that one passage^ must surely
</p>
<p>have fallen into the wrong place  such action at such a
</p>
<p>moment being impossible for any human creature. But
</p>
<p>the whole atmosphere is unreal, the whole action un-
</p>
<p>natural : no one thing said or done is less unlike the truth

<p>of life than any other ; the writing is immeasurably
</p>
<p>better than the style of the ranting tragedian Seneca,
</p>
<p>but the treatment of character is hardly more serious
</p>
<p>as a study of humanity than his. In fact, what we
</p>
<p>find here is exactly what we find in the least successful
</p>
<p>of Jonson's comedies : a study, not of humanity, but of
</p>
<p>humours. The bloody humour of Cethegus, the braggart
</p>
<p>humour of Curius, the sluggish humour of Lentulus, the
</p>
<p>swaggering humour of Catiline himself  as huffcap hero
</p>
<p>as ever mouthed and strutted out his hour on the
</p>
<p>stage  all these alike fall under the famous definition
</p>
<p>of his favourite phrase which the poet had given twelve
</p>
<p>years before in the induction to the second of his
</p>
<p>acknowledged comedies. ^ And a tragedy of humours
</p>
<p>is hardly less than a monster in nature or rather in that
</p>
<p>art which " itself is nature." Otherwise the second act
</p>
<p>must be pronounced excellent : the humours of the rival
</p>
<p>harlots, the . masculine ambition of Sempronia, the ca-
</p>
<p>prices and cajoleries of Fulvia, are drawn with Jonson's
</p>
<p>most self-conscious care and skill. But the part of
</p>
<p>Cicero is burden enough to stifle any play : and some
</p>
<p>even of the finest passages, such as the much-praised
</p>
<p>description of the dying Catiline, fine though they be,
</p>
<p>are not good in the stricter sense of the word ; the rhetor-
</p>
<p>ical sublimity of their diction comes most perilously
</p>
<p>near the verge of bombast. Altogether, the play is
</p>
<p>another magnificent mistake : and each time we open or
</p>
<p>close it we find it more difficult to beHeve that the
</p>
<p>additions made by its author some ten years before to

<p>The Spanish Tragedy can possibly have been those

<p>printed in the later issues of that famous play. Their

<p>reality, the beauty and the terror and the truth of

<p>poet : and it is all but unimaginable that such an one
</p>
<p>could have been, but a year or so afterwards, the author
</p>
<p>of Sejanus and again, eight years later, the author of
</p>
<p>Catiline. There is fine occasional writing in each, but
</p>
<p>it is not dramatic : and there is good dramatic work in

<p>each, but it is not tragic'  A. C. Swinburne. A Study
</p>
<p>of Ben J onsen, pp. 56  59.
</p>
<p>'A fondness for judging one work by comparison with
</p>
<p>others, perhaps altogether of a different class, argues
</p>
<p>a vulgar taste. Yet it is chiefly on this principle that
</p>
<p>the Catiline has been rated so low. Take it and Sejanus,
</p>
<p>as compositions of a particular kind, namely, as a mode
</p>
<p>of relating great historical events in the liveliest and
</p>
<p>most interesting manner, and I cannot help wishing
</p>
<p>that we had whole volumes of such plays. We might
</p>
<p>as rationally expect the excitement of the Vicar of
</p>
<p>Wakefield from Goldsmith's History of England, as that
</p>
<p>of Lear, Othello, &c, from the Sejanus or Catiline. . . .

<p>and bombastic tongue-bully as this Cethegus of his ! ' 
</p>
<p>S. T. Coleridge. Works 4. 193  94.

<p>Although this array of opinions is already formidable

<p>enough, I cannot resist the temptation to include part

<p>of Voltaire's preface to "his Catilina, because it is so

<p>rique, de traduire sept ou huit pages des Catilinaires,
</p>
<p>& meme il les a traduites en prose, ne croyant pas que
</p>

</p>
<p>& les vers des autres personnages, font a la verite un
</p>
<p>contraste digne de la barbaric du siecle de Ben-Johnson ;
</p>
<p>mais pour traiter un sujet si severe, si denue de ces
</p>
<p>passions qui ont tant d'empire sur le coeur, il faut avouer
</p>
<p>qu'il fallait avoir affaire a un peuple serieux & instruit,
</p>
<p>digne en quelque sorte qu'on mit sous ses yeux I'ancienne
</p>
<p>Rome. . . . On n'a point fait paraitre les deputes des

<p>soumise aux Romains, qui ne firent que le personnage
</p>
<p>de delateurs, & qui par la sont indignes de figurer sur
</p>
<p>la scene avec Ciceron, Cesar & Caton.'
</p>
<p>It will be seen that there is no little divergence of
</p>
<p>opinion here, and a moment spent in endeavoring to
</p>
<p>reconcile the disagreeing doctors may not be amiss.
</p>
<p>Speck and Swinburne state that Catiline is substantially
</p>
<p>a play of 'humours,' and such, too, is the latent inference
</p>
<p>in Coleridge's brief note. Schelling, Swinburne, and
</p>
<p>Taine alike dwell on the vigor of Jonson's pictures of
</p>
<p>Roman social life in the early Decadence ; and does not
</p>
<p>this tally with Swinburne's statement that 'there is
</p>
<p>fine occasional writing, but it is not dramatic : and
</p>
<p>there is good dramatic work, but it is not tragic ? ' I
</p>
<p>really think Swinburne has touched the heart of the
</p>
<p>matter in these words.
</p>
<p>The speeches of Catiline to the conspirators and to
</p>
<p>his troops, and Cicero's two speeches in the senate, are
</p>
<p>fine bits, not only as translation but as literature ; yet
</p>
<p>they are after all occasional, and not in any true sense
</p>
<p>dramatic. Even Gifford incorporated in his edition a

<p>note to the effect that Cicero's long oration would tax

<p>the lungs of any actor. On the other hand, the second
</p>
<p>xlviii Introduction
</p>
<p>act  which seems to me the most dramatic of all, with
</p>
<p>its masterly portrait of the vain and pampered Sempronia,
</p>
<p>and its skilful hints at Fulvia's jealousy (whereby Rome
</p>
<p>is finally to be saved)  is not at all tragic. Nor can the
</p>
<p>characters be considered truly tragic. Take Catiline.
</p>
<p>Swinburne is too supercilious in the utter dismissal of
</p>
<p>him as impossible, for he is really splendidly conceived.
</p>
<p>He rants at times, but the rant is never pure fustian.
</p>
<p>In many instances he is cruel to the limits of credibihty,
</p>
<p>but the limits are never actually exceeded ; and we
</p>
<p>must always remember that the Ehzabethan stage
</p>
<p>abounded in superb villains. The audacity, the dissimu-
</p>
<p>lation, the persuasiveness, the cunning, the dominant in-
</p>
<p>tellectuality of Catihne  all these are skilfully developed.
</p>
<p>But with all this, Catiline is not a tragic figure. The
</p>
<p>fault does not lie, it appears to me, in Jonson's dehberate
</p>
<p>rejection of Aristotle for Seneca. Shakspere's Richard III
</p>
<p>hit Aristotle's theory of the necessary respectabihty of
</p>
<p>the tragic hero a severe blow. But Shakspere had a
</p>
<p>much larger sense of the true values of life than Jonson.
</p>
<p>Physical death in his dramas is never the real tragedy,
</p>
<p>but merely an incident : the tragedy in Richard is in the
</p>
<p>decay and utter degradation before us of a human soul. A
</p>
<p>conception like this never occurs to Jonson in Catiline, and
</p>
<p>physical death is the all-in-all ; so that, as our sympathies
</p>
<p>are never once aroused, the end does not move us.
</p>
<p>The same strictures may be appKed to the characters
</p>
<p>of the other conspirators. Cethegus and Lentulus,
</p>
<p>especially, are very dramatic and effective portraitures,
</p>
<p>but they utterly lack tragic dignity. Well done as they
</p>
<p>are, they are out of place.
</p>
<p>Cicero, too, seems to me essentially an undramatic
</p>
<p>figure, although wonderfully drawn. True to life, he
</p>
<p>is long-winded to the poinlj^ of boredom, and inordi-

<p>nately given to praising his own motives and deeds ; but
</p>
<p>Critical Estimates xlix
</p>
<p>despite this, as Schelling points out, there is about him
</p>
<p>a certain large dignity and air of sincerity that invest
</p>
<p>hira with considerable charm. Especially human is
</p>
<p>his reference to Terentia in speaking to Fulvia, which
</p>
<p>might be paraphrased thus : ' I could learn to love you,
</p>
<p>but my wife won't let me ! ' Another instance of the
</p>
<p>same sort is the sneering remark that probably his wife
</p>
<p>has sent him cautions 'how to behave him.' These
</p>
<p>touches make him seem very real and very near to us,
</p>
<p>and give us a much closer personal interest in him than
</p>
<p>his saving of Rome ever could. We view heroes as a
</p>
<p>rule impersonally until we learn some little intimate
</p>
<p>thing about them which brings home to us that they
</p>
<p>are men even as ourselves : who, after hearing of poor
</p>
<p>Socrates' beratings by Xantippe, does not thrill more
</p>
<p>sympathetically at the fatal draught of hemlock ? But
</p>
<p>despite these effective bits of insight, Cicero is not really
</p>
<p>a dramatic figure. The art displayed in his portrayal
</p>
<p>is more that of the novelist than of the playwright.
</p>
<p>In another section of this Introduction, I have called
</p>
<p>attention to Jonson's obvious debt to Seneca. Catiline
</p>
<p>is, however, by no means purely Senecan. Seneca
</p>
<p>lacks frequently a sense of order, which always loomed
</p>
<p>large with Jonson. For example, authorities told Jonson
</p>
<p>that Fulvia betrayed the conspirators ; but in a drama,
</p>
<p>where everything requires motivation, the first question
</p>
<p>that arises is, why ? Having no authorities to work on,
</p>
<p>Jonson was forced to depend on his own imagination,
</p>
<p>and produced the answer in the brilliant second act.
</p>
<p>The results there achieved lead one to rather more than
</p>
<p>suspect that had Jonson not been quite so pedantic,
</p>
<p>had he had more faith in the validity of his spontaneous
</p>
<p>instincts, he would more often have attained genuine
</p>
<p>greatness. As it is, his orderly progression of plot and

<p>sure grip on character, together with his toning down of

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>the riotous decadent elements, reveal that he has made
</p>
<p>large advances on Seneca, and that he had a thorough
</p>
<p>knowledge of the necessary mechanics of the drama.
</p>
<p>In short, then, although I should not go so far with
</p>
<p>Swinburne as to call Catiline 'a splendid mistake,' I yet
</p>
<p>consider it what the French would probably call a
</p>
<p>drame manque, one that has most of the requisite
</p>
<p>elements, but has not quite 'arrived.' It just falls short
</p>
<p>of success. Indeed, the method of Jonson in this play
</p>
<p>practically precludes its complete success. In another
</p>
<p>section of this Introduction,^ I have called attention to
</p>
<p>Jonson 's determined efforts to gain 'atmosphere' by
</p>
<p>his painstaking references to the classics. Not only
</p>
<p>does he conscientiously follow the authorities in their
</p>
<p>historical data, but, as I have observed, and as a glance
</p>
<p>at the Notes will amply verify, he has drawn largely
</p>
<p>on classical sources for the dialogue. More than that,
</p>
<p>he has added a vast deal of allusion. Instances of this
</p>
<p>are fully taken up in the Notes, but it may not be amiss
</p>
<p>to collect a few here.
</p>
<p>We find, for example, references to religion, such as
</p>
<p>mention of household gods, the household Lar, ]\iars
</p>
<p>and Jove as the protectors of Rome, the Sibyl's books,
</p>
<p>the vestal nuns and the vestal flame ; historical allusions
</p>
<p>to the Gracchi, Cinna, Marius, Hannibal, Sulla, Camillus,
</p>
<p>Cincinnatus,^ Tarquin, the Bruti, Decii, Cipi, Curtii,
</p>
<p>Fabii, and Scipios ; reference to Attic statues, Tyrian
</p>
<p>hangings, Ephesian pictures, Corinthian plate, Attalic gar-
</p>
<p>ments, ivory tables, gold dishes, pheasants from the river
</p>
<p>Phasis, and oysters from Circeii ; to the tribes and centu-
</p>
<p>ries, the method of voting, the lictors, the fasces, rods,
</p>
<p>and axes ; to the Tiber, the seven hills of Rome, Lucrine

<p>Lake, the Milvian Bridge, the Aurelian Way, the temples
</p>
<p>of Jupiter Stator and Concord, the Alps, and the Tyrrhene
</p>
<p>Sea. All of these are minutely accurate. So careful,
</p>
<p>indeed, is Jonson, that he even observes the nice distinc-
</p>
<p>tions in Roman oaths. ^ Only two slips can be found in
</p>
<p>his scholarship : the references to hell, in i. 553, and to
</p>
<p>Catiline's candidacy for command in the Pontic war,
</p>
<p>in I. 90.
</p>
<p>This list of instances is totally independent of the
</p>
<p>scores of quotations, direct or indirect, imbedded in the
</p>
<p>play. The sum total of all these leaves very little that
</p>
<p>is Jonson 's own. Now Jonson 's genius was sufficient
</p>
<p>to fuse these various elements in a way impossible for
</p>
<p>one of mediocre talent, but the complete fulfilling of the
</p>
<p>task was too much even for him. It would seem that
</p>
<p>an excessive attention to details inevitably leads to a
</p>
<p>loss of proper perspective, to a failure to see the forest
</p>
<p>by reason of the trees. After all, the main object of a
</p>
<p>play is to be dramatic, to unfold human character in
</p>
<p>action ; and, more than that, to suggest behind each
</p>
<p>individual character something of the universal : to
</p>
<p>reveal, in fine, the macrocosm in the microcosm. This
</p>
<p>is true no less of historical drama than of other forms.
</p>
<p>The main object is not so much to give accurate history
</p>
<p>or accurate pictures of social life, as to interpret human
</p>
<p>traits, emotions, and activities, which in all environ-
</p>
<p>ments are much the same. Indeed, it may be held that
</p>
<p>thie more local color is gained, the more a serious play
</p>
<p>loses in force. If we feel that the personages of the play
</p>
<p>move in a world too utterly unhke our own, under con-
</p>
<p>ditions which can never be duplicated in our own lives,
</p>
<p>the appeal of the drama is either lost or greatly weakened.
</p>

</p>
<p>fear or terror that Aristotle regards as fundamental,
</p>
<p>can only enter in when we feel that the hero's plight
</p>
<p>might be our own. It is because of this that the Greek
</p>
<p>tragedy, stirring as those who understand the Greek
</p>
<p>conception of life find it, can rarely be successfully
</p>
<p>staged today, inasmuch as its underlying theory of fate
</p>
<p>is totally foreign to modern ethical doctrine. Agamem-
</p>
<p>non, as presented at the Sanders Theatre, Harvard, was
</p>
<p>successful, but its audience was elect. The same may
</p>
<p>be said of the recent performances of The Trojan Women
</p>
<p>by the Chicago Little Theater Company and others.
</p>
<p>What I have said above about undue attention to
</p>
<p>detail is really, it seems to me, fundamental, and may be
</p>
<p>illustrated by reference to various phases of art. Take
</p>
<p>painting as an example. A painter whose methods very
</p>
<p>closely parallel those of Jonson was Meissonier. For
</p>
<p>his iSoy, for instance, he bought a wheat-field, and had
</p>
<p>a company of cuirassiers ride through it, so that he
</p>
<p>might see how such a field would actually appear ; he
</p>
<p>himself riding beside the troopers, and carefully noting
</p>
<p>the attitudes of men and horses. For the 1814 he dupli-
</p>
<p>cated one of Napoleon's costumes to the last button.
</p>
<p>And what was the result? Speaking of Meissonier 's
</p>
<p>historical paintings, Kenyon Cox says^: 'The best of
</p>
<p>these ambitioRs works is perhaps the 1814. The worst
</p>
<p>is certainly the i8oy. This picture is almost an entire
</p>
<p>failure, and yet it possesses every one of the qualities
</p>
<p>which made Meissonier's greatness, in as high a degree
</p>
<p>as any earlier work. The industry, the strenuous exact-
</p>
<p>ness, the thoroughness, the impeccable draughtsman-
</p>
<p>ship, the sharpness of relief, are all here at their great-
</p>
<p>est. The amount of labor that the picture represents
</p>
<p>is simply appalling, and it is almost all wasted, because

</p>
<p>it is not the kind of labor that was wanted. On all of
</p>
<p>these figures not a gaiter button is wanting, and the
</p>
<p>total result of all this addition of detail is simply chaos.'
</p>
<p>Mr. Cox says further: 'Looked at close at hand, each
</p>
<p>head, each hand, each strap and buckle is masterly, but,
</p>
<p>at a distance sufficiently great to permit the whole
</p>
<p>canvas to be taken in at one glance, nothing is seen but
</p>
<p>a meaningless glitter. . . . He awakens only admiration,
</p>
<p>never emotion. His drawing is absolute, his relief
</p>
<p>startling, he almost gives the illusion of nature ; but he
</p>
<p>never evokes a vision of beauty or charms one into a
</p>
<p>dream.' In his anxiety to be accurate, the artist missed
</p>
<p>the effect. The rush, the bustle, the joyous triumph that
</p>
<p>the i8oy was designed to bring out, are lacking. The
</p>
<p>very art that makes The Vedette and The Reader in White
</p>
<p>masterpieces of their kind, here defeats its own end.
</p>
<p>A camera can give us mere accuracy ; we demand of the
</p>
<p>artist interpretation.
</p>
<p>If any further illustrations be required in this field,
</p>
<p>the most cursory comparisons of Tissot's treatment of
</p>
<p>the Gospel narrative with that of other painters will
</p>
<p>suffice. Tissot, like Meissonier, is at all times precise
</p>
<p>and accurate. His costumes are authentic (or as nearly
</p>
<p>so as he could make them) ; his Temple, as he tells us
</p>
<p>in the introduction to his work, follows the restoration of
</p>
<p>the architect Schieck [sic] ; his Golgotha is the proper
</p>
<p>twenty-two feet high. But compare his work with that
</p>
<p>of older artists. When we admire the mighty Christ
</p>
<p>on the Cross of Diirer, we never think of its inaccuracies,
</p>
<p>such as the birch trees in the back ground, the rounded
</p>
<p>timbers of the cross, the conventional INRI of the
</p>
<p>inscription. The majestic dignity, the almost unbearable
</p>
<p>pathos of the lonely Christ, are what thrill us. We feel
</p>
<p>here the essential mystery of our faith. Tissot's treat-

<p>ment in It Is Finished is in marked contrast. Here we
</p>
<p>liv Introduction
</p>
<p>have accurate realism : the rectangular timbers of the
</p>
<p>rood, the full inscription in Hebrew and Latin, the proper
</p>
<p>costuming, and a Christ so gory that the picture reeks of
</p>
<p>the shambles. Not even the intended touch of idealism
</p>
<p>and symbolism in the group of prophets above (each in
</p>
<p>eminently correct Jewish dress), with their folded scrolls
</p>
<p>betokening the fulfilment of prophecy, and the Solo-
</p>
<p>mon's seal, can relieve the ghastly effect. Other painters,
</p>
<p>more naive, have committed quaint anachronisms, as
</p>
<p>Bellini, in representing the Madonna with the Magdalen
</p>
<p>and St. Catherine, St. Peter with a book, St. Jerome,
</p>
<p>and an angel with a very mediaeval viol, together in his
</p>
<p>altar-piece for the church of San Zaccaria ; Botticelli, in
</p>
<p>representing the Medici, in his Adoration of the Magi,
</p>
<p>with pages and others standing about in costumes of the
</p>
<p>painter's own times ; and da Vinci, in having the guests
</p>
<p>sitting at the table, instead of recHning, in his Last
</p>
<p>Supper : but compare these works with the corresponding
</p>
<p>paintings of Tissot, and it will at once be observed how
</p>
<p>immeasurably the later artist, in his quest for correctness,
</p>
<p>has sacrificed spiritual significance. And, after all,
</p>
<p>it is this significance that is really vital.
</p>
<p>If we turn to a field so completely in the realm of
</p>
<p>pure aesthetics as music, we shall find this same principle
</p>
<p>as to local color obtaining. To cite a modern instance,
</p>
<p>the late Edward MacDowell composed an Indian Suite.
</p>
<p>For the sake of atmosphere, he made a partial use of
</p>
<p>Indian music. Speaking of this Suite, Professor Elson
</p>
<p>says^ : ' He has built this orchestral work on actual
</p>
<p>Indian themes, but we do not value this proceeding,
</p>
<p>since the figures used are utterly unfamiliar to almost
</p>
<p>every auditor. . . . But the development and the treat-
</p>
<p>ment of these figures is another story.' That is to say,

</p>
<p>MacDowell succeeds not in proportion as he uses the
</p>
<p>Indian themes, but in proportion as he gets away from
</p>
<p>them. The thing he must do, to be successful, is to
</p>
<p>interpret to us the Indian, to make us feel his primitive
</p>
<p>dignity, the vastness of the woods and prairies that he
</p>
<p>roamed, the pathos of his passing. Now Indian themes
</p>
<p>will never make us feel these things, because we respond
</p>
<p>to totally different stimuh from the Indian, and the
</p>
<p>very music that is most soulful to him is to us largely a
</p>
<p>harsh and meaningless noise. The musician must speak
</p>
<p>to us in terms of our own, if he would have us comprehend
</p>
<p>him. No one who has heard the third movement of the
</p>
<p>Indian Suite (the Dirge) can fail to recognize that Mac-
</p>
<p>Dowell has interpreted the Indian surpassingly well.
</p>
<p>In that lament of the mother for her lost warrior-son,
</p>
<p>we hear the wail of sorrow that is primitive and yet at
</p>
<p>the same time typical of all sorrow  the same cry that
</p>
<p>came from the wrung heart of Rachel, and that comes
</p>
<p>from the wrung hearts of all who are bereaved and refuse
</p>
<p>to be comforted. But it is not the Indian theme that
</p>
<p>makes us feel this : it is the romanticization of that
</p>
<p>theme (something quite foreign to the Indian), the
</p>
<p>complex harmonic development of that theme.
</p>
<p>Now the mission of Jonson as a dramatist was to
</p>
<p>interpret to us character and life. All the tirades of
</p>
<p>the conspirators against the decadence of Rome cannot
</p>
<p>make us realize that decadence so vividly as does the
</p>
<p>single incident of Catiline and the slave in the first act.
</p>
<p>All the braggadocio of Cathegus about his bravery and
</p>
<p>cruelty can not make us adequately reahze his character ;
</p>
<p>we must see him do something brave and cruel, or he
</p>
<p>becomes a mere 'tongue-bully.' To have the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors quote Lucan's Pharsalia may give us an idea of the
</p>
<p>horrors of internecine war, but it does not interpret the

</p>
<p>Ivi Introduction
</p>
<p>lack inevitableness. Too great an attention to detail
</p>
<p>makes the whole suffer.
</p>
<p>If we now turn to a brief survey of successful histor-
</p>
<p>ical plays, we may see the point in question even more
</p>
<p>clearly. First let us consider Julius CcBsar,^ hke Catiline
</p>
<p>a Roman drama. In this play, Shakspere followed but
</p>
<p>one authority, North's Plutarch, using the lives of
</p>
<p>Caesar, Antony, and Brutus. By following but this one
</p>
<p>source  one remarkably adapted to dramatization 
</p>
<p>Shakspere gains a unity of tone missed frequently in
</p>
<p>Catiline. Moreover, Shakspere 's interest throughout
</p>
<p>is in the play and the characters, not in the setting and
</p>
<p>atmosphere. The essential thing is not that Brutus
</p>
<p>(the real hero) is a Roman, but that he is pathetically
</p>
<p>mistaken in his theories and actions. The clash of ideas
</p>
<p>and parties, the destiny of a nation, and the trembling
</p>
<p>in the balance of the empire of the world  these are
</p>
<p>the things that hold our imagination, and not the locale
</p>
<p>of the piece. For details of setting, and the like, Shak-
</p>
<p>spere has scant use. Beyond what he found in Plutarch,
</p>
<p>the allusions are few, and those few largely mistaken.
</p>
<p>For example, he vaguely considers the Capitol as the
</p>
<p>meeting-place of the senate ; 2 he has a clock strike in
</p>
<p>Brutus' orchard (2. i. 192) ; he speaks of the watch, as
</p>
<p>if the London custom were likewise a Roman one (2.2. 16) .
</p>
<p>But none of these things lessens the essential dramatic
</p>
<p>^ For a fuller discussion of local color in Julius Ccssar and Catiline,
</p>
<p>see Meinck, t)ber das Ortliche und Zeitliche Kolorit in Shakespeare's
</p>
<p>Romerdramen und Ben Jonson's Catiline.

</p>
<p>Coriolanus, etc., where Shakspere makes this error, see Lizette
</p>

<p>From the stricture there made, however, that Jonson ' whisks the

<p>and Sallust, Cat. 46, for his meeting-places.
</p>
<p>Critical Estimates Ivii
</p>
<p>qualities of the play, or detracts from its interpretation
</p>
<p>of the real historical essentials.
</p>
<p>Let us likewise consider for a moment Racine's Athalie.
</p>
<p>This play affords an interesting comparison with Catiline
</p>
<p>in several ways. It is even more severely 'classical'
</p>
<p>than Jonson's work ; and there is an essential similarity
</p>
<p>in its catastrophe, in that the death of Athaliah, like that
</p>
<p>of Catiline, is not of great moment, nor productive of
</p>
<p>any great pathos. Now, in writing this play, Racine
</p>
<p>very carefully read the authorities  he cites Josephus,
</p>
<p>Menochius, Estius, and other commentators, m addi-
</p>
<p>tion to the Bible. But he at all times dominated his
</p>
<p>sources, and never was dominated by them. He takes
</p>
<p>a liberty with the age of Joash, for example, by making
</p>
<p>him nine to ten years old, whereas the Scriptures place
</p>
<p>his age at seven years. It is surprising, too, in view of
</p>
<p>the Scriptural theme, how little actual quotation is
</p>
<p>employed. There is a Biblical largeness of phrasing,
</p>
<p>but it is the spirit rather than the letter that Racine
</p>
<p>follows. The same is true in a less degree of Esther.
</p>
<p>To cite another French example, Corneille's Cid is almost
</p>
<p>romantic in its treatment of historical data.
</p>
<p>An examination of Schiller's successful historical
</p>
<p>plays will reveal the same freedom of treatment. In
</p>
<p>Wallenstein's Tod he purposely violates historical truth,
</p>
<p>as far as he knew it, in making Wallenstein conscious of
</p>
<p>wrong purpose in his attitude toward the Emperor, and
</p>
<p>penitent in regard to it, because he felt this sense of
</p>
<p>guilt necessary to the play. In this play, Schiller shows
</p>
<p>that he has digested his authorities, for scarcely a refe-
</p>
<p>rence is patent. His art is that of Milton, wherein
</p>
<p>learning and investigation tincture the whole, but
</p>
<p>seldom obtrude on the surface. The one part of Wallen-
</p>

</p>
<p>color is the Lager, which is scarcely a vital part of the
</p>
<p>Iviii Introduction
</p>
<p>drama at all. And it is significant that the Lager is the
</p>
<p>least successful on the stage of the three parts of the
</p>
<p>tragedy. In Maria Stuart, Schiller is even freer in his
</p>
<p>use of materials, and in the Jungfrau von Orleans he
</p>
<p>boldly alters history by inventing a new denouement.
</p>
<p>At his strictest, Schiller is not a realist, but idealizes his
</p>
<p>central characters, after the example set by Goethe in
</p>
<p>Goetz von Berlichingen, without the Sturm und Drang
</p>
<p>of the latter. It is noteworthy, in this connection, that
</p>
<p>Hauptmann's recent attempt, in Florian Geyer, to treat
</p>
<p>with reahstic exactness a historical period, has been a
</p>
<p>failure on the stage.
</p>
<p>We may infer, then, that Jonson's method of pains-
</p>
<p>taking accuracy is in the main wrong, as tending to
</p>
<p>place emphasis on the non-essential. However, this is
</p>
<p>not the only fundamental fault in Jonson's work. There
</p>
<p>would appear to be inherent in Catiline a certain miscon-
</p>
<p>ception of classicism, a ceitain tendency to construe the
</p>
<p>classical restraint as calm. Indeed, we still hear rather
</p>
<p>too much of the 'classical calm.' Now, of restraint there
</p>
<p>is plenty in the Greek drama : but one would have to
</p>
<p>search far to find calm in such plays as the Medea, the
</p>
<p>Antigone, the Prometheus Unbound, or the terrific Electra.
</p>
<p>Although the restrained treatment in these dramas is
</p>
<p>impossible for us, because foreign to the Anglo-Saxon
</p>
<p>genius, they yet have a terrible intensity. But Jonson
</p>
<p>followed Seneca rather than the Greeks, and Seneca
</p>
<p>is merely rhetorical. In the last analysis, Catiline is
</p>
<p>also largely rhetorical,^ \Adth too httle action.
</p>
<p>Further than this, it may be doubted whether any
</p>
<p>attempt to reproduce a bygone age in its own literary
</p>
<p>forms can succeed. The times change. What so stirred
</p>
<p>men once, no longer moves. As I said in discussing Mac-

<p>Dowell, to interpret properly, the artist must speak in
</p>
<p>our terms. Our dramatic terms are vastly different
</p>
<p>from those of Sophocles and Seneca, and an interpretation
</p>
<p>even of their times, or of their themes, must not follow
</p>
<p>their methods too closely. Even Athalie is a httle too
</p>
<p>close to the Latin method to be successful on our stage.
</p>
<p>Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris, which comes about as
</p>
<p>near as may be to catching the classical atmospljere
</p>
<p>(although the subjective treatment of the Furies is
</p>
<p>modem), is a failure on the stage. The past 77iay be
</p>
<p>interpreted to us with a vast wealth of detail, but the
</p>
<p>proper interpreter in this fashion is rather the novelist
</p>
<p>than the dramatist. Thackeray in Henry Esmond, and
</p>
<p>Sienkiewicz in Quo Vadis, for instance, have caught the
</p>
<p>true atmosphere of the times they portray, but the form
</p>
<p>they utilize is one quite distinct from the drama, and
</p>
<p>free from its restrictions.
</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about Catiline, then, is not that
</p>
<p>Jonson failed, but that he did so well under the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances.
</p>
<p>A final word ought, perhaps, to be said about the
</p>
<p>historical significance of Catiline and its companion-
</p>
<p>piece, Sejanus. Such a word must of necessity be both
</p>
<p>brief and guarded, for the evidences here are intan-
</p>
<p>gible and elusive. Nettleton, ^ although possibly a
</p>
<p>little over-zealous in his efforts to establish the auton-
</p>
<p>omy of the English drama in the Restoration and the
</p>
<p>immediately succeeding period, has yet shown conclusive-
</p>
<p>ly the influence of Jonson on later comedy. Briggs,^ in
</p>
<p>his article, Influence of Jonson on Seventeenth Century
</p>
<p>Tragedy, has collected a number of interesting parallels
</p>
<p>which indicate that Jonson's contemporaries utihzed
</p>
<p>^ In English Drama of the Restoration, etc.

<p>freely either his works or his sources, to which he had
</p>
<p>probably directed their notice. Briggs also calls atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the increasing Senecan elements in English trag-
</p>
<p>edy after the appearance of Jonson's tragedies, and to
</p>
<p>the accumulation of plays on Roman themes. These
</p>
<p>conclusions support forcibly the a priori notion that
</p>
<p>all students of Jonson must have, as to his influence
</p>
<p>on later drama. When we come to the ' classical ' period,
</p>
<p>this a priori notion is further strengthened by the patent
</p>
<p>evidence that Jonson's works were being read and
</p>
<p>discussed. Dryden cited, in his Essay of Dramatick
</p>
<p>Poesy, the rimes in Catiline and Sejanus as a justification
</p>
<p>of his heroic couplets. Shadwell, in the preface to his
</p>
<p>Sullen Lovers, defended Jonsonian comedy against the
</p>
<p>animadversions of Dryden and others, who had cried it
</p>
<p>down as lacking in wit ; and again took up the cudgels
</p>
<p>in the preface to his Humourists, and elsewhere. Vol-
</p>
<p>taire, who in his day was practically literary dictator for
</p>
<p>both England and France, read and criticized Catiline,
</p>
<p>and in his Catilina endeavored to ' improve ' upon Jonson's
</p>
<p>handling of the theme. Then, too, Catiline was acted
</p>
<p>at least up to 1691.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, to offset these considerations, is
</p>
<p>the stubborn fact that neither the manner nor the matter
</p>
<p>of the 'classical' tragedy is Jonsonian. Cato and
</p>
<p>Irene, to select examples of this tragedy at its height, are
</p>
<p>at a far remove from the manner of Catiline or Sejanus.
</p>
<p>But then, too, they are at a remove not much less from
</p>
<p>the manner of Racine and Corneille. Indeed, in intrin-
</p>
<p>sic dramatic worth and force, Catiline is nearer Athalie
</p>
<p>than is Cato. All of these plays are rhetorical, but in
</p>
<p>Jonson and the French dramatist there is fire blazing
</p>
<p>beneath, and through, the ice of the rhetoric, whereas
</p>
<p>the Enghsh 'classical' tragedy is almost totally frigid.

<p>The tone of the ' classical ' tragedy is, it would seem to me,
</p>
<p>Critical Estimates Ixi
</p>
<p>due rather to the temper of the times than to French
</p>
<p>influences. When we examine the matter of the Queen
</p>
<p>Anne and Restoration tragedy, we find no Jonsonian
</p>
<p>borrowings unmistakable enough to warrant definite
</p>
<p>assertions.
</p>
<p>In view of Jonson's undoubted weight of authority
</p>
<p>and the fact that he endeavored, long before the 'classi-
</p>
<p>cal' school arose, to write tragedy on a strictly classical
</p>
<p>theory ; and in view of the fact that the ' classical '
</p>
<p>tragedies themselves resemble the French tragedies more
</p>
<p>in accidentals than in essentials, I should hazard it as
</p>
<p>my opinion that a 'classical' tragedy of some sort was,
</p>
<p>in the course of a natural evolution, bound to appear in
</p>
<p>England, and that, even without French models, it would
</p>
<p>not have differed greatly in its methods and tone from
</p>
<p>the tragedy that did appear. The French impetus
</p>
<p>probably hastened its actual appearance, and gave it a
</p>
<p>certain bias, but was hardly responsible for its coming

<p>In great affaires, and doubtful!, it behooues

<p>Men, that are ask'd their sentence, to be free
</p>
<p>50 From either hate, or loue, anger, or pittie :
</p>
<p>For, where the least of these doe hinder, there
</p>
<p>The mind not easily discemes the truth,
</p>
<p>I speake this to you, in the name of Rome,
</p>
<p>For whom you stand ; and to the present cause :
</p>
<p>455 That this foule fact of LENTVLVS, and the rest,
</p>
<p>Weigh not more with you, then your dignitie ;
</p>
<p>And you be more indulgent to your passion,
</p>
<p>Then to your honor. If there could be found
</p>
<p>A paine, or punishment, equall to their crimes,
</p>
<p>460 I would deuise, and helpe : but, if the greatnesse
</p>
<p>Of what they ha' done, exceed aU mans inuention,
</p>
<p>I thinke it fit, to stay, where our lawes doe.

</p>
<p>DEDICATION
</p>
<p>William, Earl of Pembroke. William Herbert, third earl
</p>
<p>of Pembroke, was born in 1580 and died in 1630. He was
</p>
<p>Lord Chamberlain from 1615 to 1625, Lord Steward from
</p>
<p>1626 to 1630, and Chancellor of the University of Oxford in
</p>
<p>1624. In the latter year Broadgates Hall was refounded in
</p>
<p>his honor as Pembroke CoUege. By some critics he has been
</p>
<p>identified with the ' Mr. W. H. ' of the Shakspere sonnets,
</p>
<p>but the evidence is doubtful. He was made a Knight of the
</p>
<p>Garter in the first year of James i. To him Jonson also
</p>
<p>dedicated his Epigrams.
</p>
<p>5. lig-giuen times. The jig was a common conclusion to
</p>
<p>theatrical performances, usually being performed by the clowns
</p>
<p>and fools of the play just finished, and lasting about an hour.
</p>
<p>Probably it was a ludicrous composition in rhyme, sung or
</p>
<p>recited by the clown, accompanied by dancing and music on
</p>
<p>the pipe and tabor (see Collier, Stage 3. 182 ff.).
</p>
<p>6. Against all noise of opinion. Jonson 's impatient con-
</p>
<p>tempt for popular judgment is expressed more than once in
</p>
<p>his works. In a passage in Timber, ' Censura de poetis ',
</p>
<p>{Wks. 9. 153) q. v., he vigorously presents his views.
</p>
<p>9. The first (of this race). That is, tragedy. Sejanus,
</p>
<p>1605, was without dedication. W.

<p>SYLLA'S ghost. Several classic tragedies open with the
</p>
<p>appearance of a ghost  as, for example, the Hecuba of
</p>
<p>Euripides with the spectre of Polydorus  but the opening
</p>
<p>here is imitated particularly from Seneca's Thyestes and
</p>
<p>Agamemmnon. In both, a spirit rises from Hades on the eve
</p>
<p>of a fearful crime, and one inspired in some measure by his
</p>
<p>own, to foreshadow the coming horrors. In Thyestes, it is
</p>
<p>the shade of Tantalus,^ whose crime, terrible as it was, is
</p>
<p>exceeded by that of Atreus. In Agamemnon, it is the shade
</p>
<p>of Thyestes, whose son by an incestuous marriage, ^gisthus ,

<p>murders Agamemnon. Jonson's choice of Sylla's ghost here
</p>
<p>was probably influenced by a bit fromLucan, Phars.i. 58081 :
</p>
<p>Et medio visi consurgere Campo
</p>
<p>Tristia Sullani cecinere oracula manes.
</p>
<p>Catiline had been an ardent supporter of Sulla, and Sallust,
</p>
<p>in sections 5, 11 13 of his Catiline, implies that it was largely
</p>
<p>the successes of the dictator that mspired him. Cf . ' Hunc
</p>
<p>post dominationem Lucii Sullae lubido maxima invaserat
</p>
<p>reipublicae capiendse, neque id quibus modis assequeretur,
</p>
<p>dum sibi regnum pararet, quidquam pensi habebat ' (Sallust,
</p>
<p>Catiline 5).
</p>
<p>Sulla was the leading character in the civil war, culmi-
</p>
<p>nating in the terrible proscriptions of 81 B. C. Although
</p>
<p>Sulla possessed many admirable qualities, and was in some
</p>
<p>respects a thoughtful statesman, his name has always been a
</p>
<p>synonym for cruelty, because of the unbridled ferocity of
</p>
<p>his vengeance in the proscriptions. For a full account of his
</p>
<p>career, see Dio Cassius 36. 44, 37. 25 ; Suetonius, Caesar 9 ;
</p>
<p>Appian, Bell. Civ. 2. 76.
</p>
<p>4, 5. The sense is, ' and be less portentous than an earth-
</p>
<p>quake of the destruction of thee and thine. ' For threaten
</p>
<p>in this sense, cf. Winter's Tale 3. 3. 4 :
</p>
<p>The skies look grimly,
</p>
<p>And threaten present blusters.
</p>
<p>II. Behold I Come.^ Cf. Seneca, Thy. 8y 8g:
</p>
<p>Mittor ut dirus vapor
</p>
<p>Tellure rupta, vel gravem populis luem
</p>
<p>Sparsura pestis.
</p>
<p>21. GRACCHI, CINNA, MARIVS.
</p>
<p>The selection by Jonson here of the Gracchi as types of the
</p>
<p>vengeful and destructive revolutionists is rather unhappy.
</p>
<p>Although revolutionary in their methods, they were in purpose
</p>
<p>ardent reformers. Both were kiUed in disturbances. Cinna

<p>memnon (!).
</p>
<p>138 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT I
</p>
<p>was consul in 87 B. C. While Sulla was absent from Rome,
</p>
<p>he joined Marius in his horrible vengeance on the aristocratic
</p>
<p>party. Marius was a leader of the democratic or popular
</p>
<p>party of Rome. His rivalry with Sulla caused the first civil
</p>
<p>war in 88. In that year he was driven from Rome, but
</p>
<p>returned in 87, during Sulla's absence. His capture of Rome
</p>
<p>and subsequent administration of the government were
</p>
<p>marked by horrible cruelties.
</p>
<p>24. And HANNIBAL could not haue wish'd to see. Cf.
</p>
<p>'Et quidquid nee Hannibal videretur optasse' (Florus, Epit.
</p>
<p>4.1).
</p>
<p>27. Thy former facts. In the 16 th and 17 th centuries
</p>
<p>the commonest sense of fact was ' an evil deed, a crime. ' Cf .
</p>
<p>All's Well 3. 7. 47 : ' Where both not sin, and yet a sinful
</p>
<p>fact.' Cf. also the legal phrase still in use, ' accessory before
</p>
<p>(or after) the fact.' So also in i. 41 (see Glossary).
</p>
<p>29. Conscience of them prouoke thee on to more. Cf.
</p>
<p>'Agitabatur magis magisque in dies animus ferox inopia rei
</p>
<p>familiaris et conscientia scelerum' (Sallust, Cat. 5). See
</p>
<p>Glossary.
</p>
<p>31. Thy forcing first a Vestall nunne. Sallust gives us
</p>
<p>this information in Cat. 15. This priestess of Vesta was
</p>
<p>Fabia Terentia, sister to Terentia, Cicero's wife. She was
</p>
<p>accused by Clodius, but being powerfully defended by Catulus
</p>
<p>and others of influence, was acquitted. The penalty for
</p>
<p>violation of the vestal vows was death.
</p>
<p>32. Thy parricide late on thine owne onely sonne. Sallust
</p>
<p>states it as the common belief that Catiline put his son to death
</p>
<p>because Aurelia Orestilla dreaded having a grown-up stepson
</p>
<p>(see Cat. 15).
</p>
<p>33. To make emptie way. Cf. 'Cum morte superioris
</p>
<p>uxoris, novis nuptiis domum vacuam fecisses' (Cicero,
</p>
<p>I Cat. 6).
</p>
<p>36. Which got thee, at once, a daughter and a wife. In

<p>a fragment of Cicero {In Toga Candida), occurs this passage :
</p>
<p>'Cum deprehendebare in adulteriis, cum deprehendebas
</p>
<p>adulteros ipse, cum ex eodem stupro tibi et uxorem et filiam
</p>
<p>invenisti.' On this passage Asconius Pedianus thus comments :
</p>
<p>ACT I] Notes 139
</p>
<p>' Dicitur Catilina adulterium commisse cum ea, quae ei postea
</p>
<p>socrus fuit, et ex eo natum stupro duxisse uorem, cum filia
</p>
<p>eius esset. Hoc Lucceius quoque Catilinae obicit in orationi-
</p>
<p>bus quas in eum scripsit. Nomina harum mulierum nondum
</p>
<p>inveni.' Plutarch, too {Life of Cicero 10), says that Catiline
</p>
<p>was accused of debauching his own daughter,

</p>
<p>{De Pet. Con. 2. 9.) accuses Catiline of murders done in
</p>
<p>Sulla's cause. Plutarch, in Sulla 32, mentions especially one
</p>
<p>M. Marius, whom Catiline slew with his own hands, bearing
</p>
<p>the head to Sulla, In return for this, Sulla entered Catiline's
</p>
<p>brother among the proscribed (see note to 40), Asconius
</p>
<p>Pedianus, in his comment on Cicero's lost In Toga Candida,
</p>
<p>quotes Cicero as accusing Catiline of four specific murders.
</p>
<p>40, And writ him in the list of my proscrib'd. See note
</p>
<p>on 37, supra. Plutarch, Cic. 10, also furnishes this infor-
</p>
<p>mation. By having his brother's name placed on the proscrip-
</p>
<p>tion-lists, Catiline could readily make it appear, in those
</p>
<p>troublous times, as if the death had occured in the due

</p>
<p>was unable to declare himself a candidate, as had been his
</p>
<p>intention, for the consulship within the legitimate number
</p>
<p>of days. Following this, he conspired with Cneius Piso and
</p>
<p>Autronius to assassinate the consuls, L, Cotta and L. Tor-
</p>
<p>quatus, in the Capitol, on the first of January ; then, when
</p>
<p>they had seized the fasces, Piso was to be sent with an army
</p>
<p>to occupy Spain, The design was discovered, and postponed
</p>
<p>until February ; when the murder of most of the senate was to

</p>
<p>This prophecy of the three Cornelii is mentioned in Sallust,

<p>Cat. 47 ; Plutarch, Cic. 17 ; and Cicero, 3 Cat. 4. Plutarch
</p>
<p>says the verses were forged.

<p>The Sibyl here referred to is the Cumsean, the only Roman
</p>
<p>Sibyl. For the story of the Sibylline books, see Dionysius,
</p>
<p>Antiq. Rom. 4. 62. The books were kept in the Capitol. In
</p>
<p>B. C. 83 the Capitol burned, and the senate made a new
</p>
<p>collection of Sibylline utterances by sending envoys to
</p>
<p>various places, and making local additions. These were kept
</p>
<p>in the new Capitol (Tacitus, Ann. 6. 12).

<p>139. Avgvres. At this time there were two priestlj'
</p>
<p>colleges, the pontiffs and augurs, each of fifteen members
</p>
<p>[quindecemviri) . The augurs prepared the place for the
</p>

<p>interpretation. They alone had the right to read and inter-
</p>
<p>pret the Sibylline books.

</p>
<p>volunt, honores, quos quieta republica desperant, perturbata

<p>155. To their crude hopes. Rude, ill-digested hopes. Cf.

<p>Dedication : 'Against all noise of opinion : from whose crude,
</p>
<p>and ayrie reports, I appeale,' etc.

<p>157. Th' idle Captaynes. ' Non nullos ex Sullanis colonis,
</p>
<p>quibus lubido atque luxuria ex magnis rapinis nihil reliqui
</p>
<p>fecerant' (Sallust, Cat. 28).
</p>
<p>159. The profuse waters of their patrimonies. ' Nam
</p>
<p>quicumque impudicus, adulter, ganeo, manu, bona patria
</p>
<p>laceraverat, quique alienum aes grande conflaverat' (Sallust,
</p>
<p>Cat. 14). The rest of this speech, to 180, is taken from the
</p>
<p>same source, being in part a direct translation.
</p>
<p>172. As I haue boyes. The hmits to which the pro-
</p>
<p>fligacy of the period went are almost unimaginable. Cicero
</p>
<p>in 2 Phil. 18 accuses Antony of this same unnatural crime.
</p>
<p>See also Juvenal, Sat. 2.
</p>
<p>177. Community. Defined (N.E.D.) as 'social inter-
</p>
<p>course, fellowship, communion ' ; but it is evidently here
</p>
<p>tinged strongly with the idea of licentiousness, as conveyed
</p>
<p>in jreedome and the lines immediately preceding.
</p>
<p>181. Like one of Ivno's or of love's disguises. The gods,
</p>
<p>in the pursuance of their numerous amours, had recourse

<p>to many disguises. Take, for instance, the case of Danae.
</p>
<p>See note on 2. 182.
</p>
<p>185. Or the scene shifted in our theaters. The Roman
</p>
<p>theater used a fixed stage-setting, and observed the unity of
</p>
<p>place ; so the use of scene here is an anachronism, whether it

</p>
<p>satirical. As scenic effects were at this time very crude

<p>in the prologue to Every Man In {Wks. i. 4), he had ridi-

</p>
<p>LENTVLVS. Publius Lentulus Sura had been consul in
</p>
<p>71 B. C, but had been expelled from the Senate by the
</p>
<p>censors for profligacy. At this time he was standing for
</p>
<p>praetor, so as to regain his senatorial seat, the election to
</p>
<p>that office being a necessary qualification. See Plutarch,
</p>
<p>Cic. i.y.
</p>
<p>CETHEGVS. Caius Cethegus, like Lentulus, was of the
</p>
<p>Cornelian gens. Cicero (3 Cat. 7) and Sallust both describe
</p>
<p>him as rash and fiery.
</p>
<p>191  197. Perhaps suggested by Lucan, Phars., 1. 233  36:
</p>
<p>lamque dies primos belli visura tumultus
</p>
<p>Exoritur. Seu sponte deum, seu turbidus Auster

<p>194. Rosy-finger'd. The stock Homeiic epithet.
</p>
<p>198. A haile. The customary salutation of Romans on
</p>
<p>morning visits to their patrons was ave, 'hail!'
</p>
<p>205. Vertue. Both here and elsewhere, this word is
</p>
<p>strongly tinged by the sense of the Latin virtus, 'manly
</p>
<p>qualities,' 'courage.'
</p>
<p>211. Mere dormice. The dormouse is, with Jonson, a
</p>
<p>synonym for drowsy inactvity. Cf. Cyn. Rev. 3. 2 {Wks. 2.
</p>
<p>260) : 'Let him go, dormouse : he is in a dream now' ; and
</p>
<p>New Inn i. i {Wks. 5. 324) : 'I was the laziest creature, . . .
</p>
<p>and slept away my life beyond the dormouse,'

<p>AVTRONIVS. Publius Autronius had been a companion
</p>
<p>of Cicero in his boyhood, and his colleague in the quaestor-
</p>
<p>ship. The year following the conspiracy he was banished,
</p>
<p>under the Plautian law, together with Longinus, Lecca, and
</p>
<p>Vargunteius.
</p>
<p>VARGVNTEIVS. Little is known of Lucius Vargunteius,
</p>
<p>except that at one time he had been accused of bribery, and
</p>
<p>defended by Hortensius (see Cicero, Pro. P. Sulla 2).
</p>
<p>LONGINVS. Lucius Cassius Longinus had been a competi-
</p>
<p>tor with Cicero for the consulship (Asconius Pededianus,
</p>
<p>In Tog. Can.). His corpulence was proverbial.
</p>
<p>CVRTVS. Quintus Curius, like Lentulus, had been removed
</p>
<p>from thesenate for profligacy. He was adescendant of M. Curius
</p>
<p>Dentatus, the opponent of Pyrrhus (see Sallust, Cat. 23).

<p>FVLVIVS. GABINIVS. Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and
</p>

</p>
<p>his death at the end of the conspiracy ; Fulvius was exiled,

</p>
<p>from falconry. A hawk's eyes were 'seeled' by passing a
</p>
<p>thread through the lids, and tying it behind the head. To
</p>
<p>'unseel' the eyes was to remove the stitches.
</p>
<p>298. Dull. C.'s definition of dull here as 'producing
</p>
<p>drowsiness' is fanciful. As a storm is impending, the sense
</p>
<p>is evidently 'gloomy,' 'clouded.' Cf. Henry V. 3. 5. 16: 'Is
</p>
<p>not their climate foggy, raw and dull ? *
</p>
<p>309323. A description of portents is found in Dio
</p>
<p>Cassius 37. 25, but these are quite different from those in the
</p>
<p>text, being the flight of strange birds, thunderbolts from a
</p>
<p>clear sky, apparitions of the dead, and flashes in the west
</p>
<p>running up to heaven. These prodigies did not occur until a
</p>
<p>later date in the conspiracy, says G. However, it is doubtful
</p>
<p>if they have anything whatever to do with the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>being unusual occurrences at the attempted holding of the
</p>
<p>augurium salutis for the year B.C. 63. 'This,' says Dio
</p>
<p>Cassius (tr. Foster), 'is a kind of augury, which consists of
</p>
<p>an enquiry whether the god allows them to request welfare
</p>
<p>for the State, as if it were unholy even to make a request for
</p>
<p>it until the action received sanction. That day of the year
</p>
<p>was observed on which no army went out to war, or was
</p>
<p>taking defensive measures against any, or was fighting a
</p>
<p>battle.' G.'s assertion that Jonson borrows the circum-
</p>
<p>stances in the text from Dio is groundless. In Cicero,
</p>
<p>3 Cat. 8, signs and wonders are also mentioned, which,
</p>
<p>as the details coincide, would seem to be the same as those
</p>
<p>mentioned by Dio. Cicero (G. again to the contrary, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding) assigns no definite time to the marvels. In

</p>
<p>As no date is assigned to these prodigies, Jonson violates
</p>
<p>no historical facts in having the portents occur at the first
</p>
<p>meeting of the conspirators. As for his details, they are
</p>
<p>culled mainly from Lucan's Pharsalia and from Seneca.
</p>
<p>Sudden darkness as a portent is mentioned in Seneca's

<p>Thyestes 784 ff., in the description of Atreus' feast, which
</p>
<p>is referred to in the text  that horrible banquet where
</p>
<p>Atreus served up to his brother Thyestes the bodies of his
</p>
<p>three murdered sons. Seneca mentions sudden darkness also

<p>in Hercules Furens 944, and Agamemnon 967. Lucan mentions

<p>it also in Phars. 7. 451.

<p>bad omen in Phars. i. 549 ; groans issue from the soil after the
</p>
<p>battle, Phars. 8. 760.
</p>
<p>The bloody arm waving a torch was suggested by Phars .1.572:
</p>
<p>Ingens urbem cingebat Errinnys,
</p>
<p>Excutiens pronam flagranti vertice pinum.
</p>
<p>316. And force a day. Construed with the context, the
</p>
<p>meaning is : 'Our imaginations are easily stirred, and cause
</p>
<p>us to attach undue importance to the day (with its portents,
</p>
<p>etc.).' Cf. Rape of Lucrece 1021 : 'I force not argument a
</p>
<p>straw.' See Glossary.
</p>
<p>318. We Jeare what our selues aine. Cf. Lucan, Phars. i.
</p>
<p>486 : ' Quae finxere, timent.'
</p>
<p>326. Noblest Romanes, etc. Beginning here and extending
</p>
<p>to 420, the speech of Catiline is in general a paraphrase of
</p>
<p>the speech in Sallust, Cat. 20 :
</p>
<p>' Ni virtus fidesque vestra spectata mihi forent, nequid-
</p>
<p>quam opportuna res cecidisset ; spes magna, dominatio, in
</p>

<p>Sat. 120. 87: 'Aedificant auro sedesque ad sidera mittunt.'
</p>
<p>356. Bred, to consume come. Cf. Horace, Epist. 2. 27 :
</p>
<p>'Fruges consumere nati.' Come is here used in its general
</p>
<p>sense as ' grain.'
</p>
<p>ACT I] Notes 149
</p>
<p>359. Trembling beneath their rods. 'The original is "Sine
</p>
<p>gratia, sine auctoritate, iis obnoxii, quibussi respublica valeret
</p>
<p>formidini essemus." Our poet hath preserved the sentiment,
</p>
<p>and given it a very ingenious turn ; the allusion is to the con-
</p>
<p>sul's fasces, or rods, in which the axe was bound up.'  W.
</p>
<p>371. All things grown aged. Sallust, Cat. 20, has consen-
</p>
<p>uerunt, which would, perhaps, be better rendered 'have
</p>
<p>fallen into decay,' than so literally.
</p>
<p>384. Tyrian hangings. A very highly esteemed and
</p>
<p>expensive dye was the purple from Tyre. It is frequently
</p>
<p>mentioned by the satirists. See Juvenal, Sat. 1. 27 ; 10. 38;
</p>
<p>Horace, Ep. 16. 18, etc.
</p>
<p>385. Ephesian pictures. The temple of Diana at Ephesus
</p>
<p>was far-famed for its art-treasures. The city was the home
</p>
<p>of two famous painters, Parrhasius and Apelles. Cf. Strabo,
</p>
<p>Geog. 14. I. 19 ff.
</p>
<p>Corinthian plate. Corinth was sacked by Rome in 146 B.C.,
</p>
<p>and all of its art-objects carried to Rome. It was especially
</p>
<p>renowned for its brass ware. At this time the city was
</p>
<p>practically a deserted ruin, so that no importations of 'plate'
</p>
<p>could be made. Cf. Strabo, Geog. 8. 6. 23 ff.
</p>
<p>386. Attalieke garments. Garments made of cloth of
</p>
<p>gold were caUed vestimenta attalica from their reputed inven-
</p>
<p>tor. King Attains III of Pergamon (see Pliny, Nat. Hist. 8. 74).
</p>
<p>New found gemmes. Phny, Nat. Hist. 37. 6, gives a long
</p>
<p>account of the jewels displayed at Rome in the triumph of
</p>
<p>Pompey. One of the most remarkable was a chessboard
</p>
<p>made of two precious stones, three feet wide by two feet
</p>
<p>long ( !), having upon it a moon of solid gold, weighing
</p>
<p>thirty pounds.
</p>
<p>388. The riuer Phasis. The river Phasis was the great
</p>
<p>breeding-place for pheasants, which were considered luxuries.

</p>
<p>389. Lucrine lake. See Juvenal, Sai. 4. 140142 :
</p>
<p>Circeis nata forent an
</p>
<p>Lucrinum ad saxum Rutupinove edita fundo
</p>
<p>Ostrea, callebat primo depraendere morsu.
</p>
<p>See also Horace, Sat. 2. 4. 323.
</p>
<p>391. Witty gluttony. An echo of Petronius, Sat. 119. 33 :
</p>
<p>'Ingeniosa gula est.' For instances of the grotesque lengths
</p>
<p>to which ' witty gluttony ' would go, see Petronius, Cena Trim-
</p>
<p>alchionis.
</p>
<p>393. Then, if the echo like not. For like in this sense of
</p>
<p>'be pleasing,' cf. The Devil is an Ass, Prologue {Wks. 5. 5) :
</p>
<p>'If this play do not like, the devil is in't.'
</p>
<p>397  401. Suggested by Petronius, Sat. 119. 85ff. :
</p>
<p>Aspice late
</p>
<p>Luxuriam spoliorum et censum in damna furentem ....
</p>
<p>ExpeUuntur aquae saxis, mare nascitur arvis,
</p>
<p>Et permutat rerum statione rebellant.
</p>
<p>416. Use me your generall. Sallust has 'Imperatore me
</p>
<p>utimini ' {Cat. 20) . The construction is slightly strained in
</p>
<p>English.
</p>
<p>418. I not doubt. For the omission of do or did when the
</p>
<p>verb is preceded by not, see Abbott,  305. Cf. the next line :
</p>
<p>if trust not flatter me ; 490, etc.
</p>
<p>423. Sacrament. Sacr amentum, in Roman use, was ap-
</p>
<p>plied most generally to the oath of enlistment in military
</p>
<p>service, although it might apply to any solemn engagement
</p>
<p>ratified with a ceremony. In this latter sense it is here used.
</p>
<p>Cf. Spenser, F.Q. 5. i. 125:
</p>
<p>This doubtful cause's right
</p>
<p>Can hardly but by sacrament be tried.
</p>
<p>425. Diff erring hurts, where powers are so prepared.
</p>
<p>Cf. Lucan, Phars. i. 281 : ' Semper nocuit differre paratis. '

<p>426472. The ideas here expressed, at times the very
</p>
<p>words, are found in Sallust, Cat. 21 :

</p>
<p>443. CNEIVS PISO. Piso has been represented as
</p>
<p>almost as complete in his villainies as Catiline. When
</p>
<p>quaestor, he was said to be concerned in the first conspiracy
</p>
<p>of Catiline, 65 B. C, when the alleged plan was to kill the
</p>
<p>senate, proclaim Crassus dictator, and make Caesar master
</p>
<p>of the horse. According to the story, two attempts to
</p>
<p>carry out this plan were foiled, but no proceedings were
</p>
<p>taken against the conspirators. Piso was removed from
</p>
<p>Rome, however, and sent with praetorian powers to Hither
</p>
<p>Spain. It can readily be seen, if this were true, how easily
</p>
<p>he could have been induced to enter the new conspiracy. See
</p>
<p>Mommsen, History of Rome 4. 464 ff. ; Mommsen considers
</p>
<p>these stories mostly gossip.
</p>
<p>444. NVCERINVS. One of the conspirators was Pubhus
</p>
<p>Sittius from Nuceria, a speculator. Compelled by financial
</p>
<p>embarrassments to keep out of Italy, he had armed a troo'p
</p>
<p>of desperados in Mauretania and Spain, and wandered with
</p>
<p>these as a leader of free lances in Western Africa, where he

<p>had old commercial relations (Mommsen, History of Rome
</p>
<p>4. 469).
</p>
<p>483. I' haue kill'd a slaue. See Sallust, Cat. 22 :
</p>
<p>'Fuere ea tempestate qui dicerunt Catilinam, oratione
</p>
<p>152 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT I
</p>
<p>habita, cum ad jusjurandum populates sceleris sui adigeret,
</p>
<p>humani corporis sanguinem, vino permixtum, in pateris
</p>
<p>circumtulisse ; inde quam post exsecrationem omnes degusta-
</p>
<p>vissent, sicut in solemnibus sacris fieri consuevit, aperuisse
</p>
<p>consilium suum, atque eo dictitare fecisse, quo inter se fidi
</p>
<p>magis forent alius alii tanti facinoris conscii. NonnuUi
</p>
<p>ficta et haec et multa praeterea existimabant ab his, qui
</p>
<p>Ciceronis invidiam, quae postea orta est, linire credebant
</p>
<p>atrocitate sceleris eorum, qui poenas dederant. Nobis ea
</p>
<p>res pro magnitudine parum comperta est.'
</p>
<p>It will be noticed that Sallust does not give undue credence
</p>
<p>to this report. Plutarch states that the conspirators sacri-
</p>
<p>ficed a man and ate of his flesh {Cic. 10). Florus {Epitome
</p>
<p>4. i) charges the drinking of blood. The story is, however,
</p>
<p>very probably untrue.
</p>
<p>505. What aile you ? This verb is at times intransitive,
</p>
<p>says N.E.D., by reason of mistaking the personal object,
</p>
<p>which in early times usually preceded the impersonal verb,
</p>
<p>for the subject. Cf. All's Well 2. 4. 6 : 'If she be very well,
</p>
<p>what does she ail, that she's not very well ?' This use of the
</p>
<p>verb is not totally obsolete, as N.E.D. cites an instance as
</p>
<p>late as 1869.
</p>
<p>508. Are you coying it. Acting coyly. Cf. Massinger,
</p>
<p>New Way to Pay Old Debts 3. 2 :
</p>
<p>When he comes to woo you see you do not coy it :
</p>
<p>This mincing modesty has spoil'd many a match.
</p>
<p>CHORUS.
</p>
<p>In this string of moral reflections, which Jonson calls a
</p>
<p>chorus, but which is spoken by no one, and addressed to no
</p>
<p>one, he thought not of imitating the ancients, but his own
</p>
<p>countrymen. Most of our old tragedies have appendages
</p>
<p>of this kind ; but those which he had obviously in view were
</p>
<p>the Cornelia of Kyd, and the four tragedies of Lord Stirling

</p>
<p>ACT I] Notes 153
</p>
<p>like the present, make no apparent part of the action. Gor-
</p>
<p>boduc has a chorus, and to name no more, so have the Cleo-
</p>
<p>patra and Philotas of Daniel, all prior to Catiline.  G. The
</p>
<p>chorus is a translation of parts of the rhapsody of Eumolpus
</p>
<p>(Petronius Arbiter, Sat. 119, 120).
</p>
<p>531535. Cf. Petronius, Sat. 120. 8084 
</p>
<p>Fors, cui nulla placet nimium secura potestas.
</p>
<p>Quae nova semper amas et mox possessa relinquis,
</p>
<p>Ecquid Romano sentis te pondere victam.
</p>
<p>Nee posse ulterius perituram extoUere molem ?
</p>
<p>542. Obnoxious to. The Latin obnoxiosus means 'sub-
</p>
<p>ject to.' The Latinism here employed thus creates a grave
</p>
<p>obscurity in English.
</p>
<p>544. And what they raise so ill sustaine. Cf. Petronius,
</p>
<p>Sat. 120. 85: 'Et quas struxit opes, male sustinet.'
</p>
<p>545. Rome, now, is Mistris. Cf. Petronius, Sat. 119. i :
</p>
<p>'Orbem iam totum victor Romanus habebat.'
</p>
<p>553555. Cf. the speech of Pluto to Fortune (Petronius,
</p>
<p>Sat. 120. 9094) :
</p>
<p>En etiam mea regna petunt. Perfosa dehiscit
</p>
<p>Mollibus insanis tellus, iam montibus haustis
</p>
<p>Antra gemunt, et dum vanos lapis invenit usus,
</p>
<p>Inferni manes caelum sperare fatentur.
</p>
<p>560. Yet, are the men more loose than they. Lucan,
</p>
<p>Phars. I. 1645, has the following:
</p>
<p>Cultus gestare decoros
</p>
<p>Vix nuribus rapuere mares.
</p>
<p>Suetonius, Calig. 52, also comments on the effeminacy of
</p>
<p>male attire.
</p>
<p>563, 564. So muche, that kinde May seeke it selfe there,
</p>
<p>and not finde. Men seeking men would be unable to find
</p>
<p>any, Kinde being used in the sense of ' nature ', as in The Devil
</p>

</p>

<p>565568. The luxury here described appears to be an
</p>
<p>epitome of that described by Lucan in his account of Cleopa-
</p>
<p>tra's feast to Caesar {Phars. 10. 104 ff.). Ivory tables, silk
</p>
<p>couches, and gold and crystal goblets, are mentioned among
</p>
<p>other things. Ivory tables are also mentioned bj^ Juvenal,
</p>
<p>Sat. II. 123.
</p>
<p>57778. Cf. Juvenal, Sat. 1. 8788:
</p>
<p>Et quando uberior vitiorum copia ? quando
</p>
<p>Maior avaritiae patuit sinus ?
</p>
<p>579587. Cf. Petronius, Sat. 119. 3945, and 4951 :

</p>
<p>Ad praedem stretitumque lucri sufh-agia vertunt.

</p>
<p>Ipsaque maiestas auro corrupta iacebat. . . .
</p>
<p>Quare tam perdita Roma
</p>
<p>Ipsa sui merces erat et sine vindice praeda.
</p>
<p>ACT II.
</p>
<p>FVLVIA. Plutarch, Cic. 16, caUs Fulvia 'a woman of
</p>
<p>quality.' In Antonius 10 he mentions a Fulvia, now the wife
</p>
<p>of Antony, as having been the wife of Clodius. Sallust,
</p>
<p>Cat. 23, says she was of high birth. 6ALLA. This character
</p>
<p>is Jonson's own creation.
</p>
<p>This whole act was developed by Jonson from hints in
</p>
<p>SaUust, Cat. 23, 24, 25, which are quoted below. From the
</p>
<p>first passage he took the incidents which he weaves into the
</p>
<p>quarrel of Fulvia and Curius ; from the second, the basis for
</p>
<p>the introduction of Sempronia and her activities ; and from
</p>
<p>the third, the character of Sempronia :

<p>16. Good impertinence. The turning of the predominant
</p>
<p>quality of the moment into an appellative is common, Cf.
</p>
<p>2. 219, where Curius calls Fulvia 'pretty solennesse/ and
</p>
<p>2. 235, where Galla is called 'good diligence.' Also Coriolanus
</p>
<p>2. I. 192, where Coriolanus addresses Volumnia : 'My
</p>
<p>gracious silence, hail ! '
</p>
<p>30. Wit-worme. A contemptuous title. The use of
</p>
<p>'worm' as denoting contempt or pity is frequent, Cf. Tem-
</p>
<p>pest 3. I. 31: 'Poor worm, thou art infected'; also the
</p>
<p>popular hymn.
</p>
<p>Would He devote that sacred head
</p>
<p>For such a worm as I ?
</p>
<p>There is an element of this in the modern term 'book-
</p>
<p>worm' for a student, although the direct derivation here
</p>
<p>is different,
</p>
<p>3468. The characteristics here enumerated are practi-
</p>
<p>cally all found in Sallust, Cat. 25, quoted supra.
</p>
<p>51, An honest woman. For honest in the sense of 'vir-
</p>
<p>tuous,' cf. the title of Dekker's play. The Honest Whore.
</p>
<p>52, 53. Few wise womens honesties
</p>
<p>Will doe their courtship hurt. Few wise women's purity
</p>
<p>will interfere with their being courted. Courtship is here
</p>
<p>used in a slightly unusual sense.
</p>
<p>63. Rather a visor than a face. Cf. Juvenal, Sat. 6. 467 :
</p>
<p>'Tandem aperit vultum et tectoria prima reponit.'
</p>
<p>66. But shee is faine of late. For definition of faine here,
</p>
<p>see Glossary. An instance of similar use occurs in Two
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of Verona 1. 1. 117: 'Well, I perceive I must be
</p>

<p>70. There is the gallant ! For the use of gallant as a
</p>
<p>modish woman, cf. Pepys, Diary, 4 September, 1662 : ' She
</p>
<p>would fain be a gallant.'

<p>88. The foole is wild, I thinke. The term joole carries
</p>
<p>with it no necessary stigma of mental deficiency. It was in
</p>
<p>common use in Jonson's day as a term of endearment, shghtly
</p>
<p>tinged with pity. Cf. Winter's Tale 2. i. 118 : 'Do not weep,
</p>
<p>good fools ; there is no cause.* It is used with telling pathos
</p>
<p>in Lear 5. 3. 306: 'And my poor fool is hang'd.'
</p>
<p>97. Tribes. At this time there were thirty-five tribes,
</p>
<p>patricians and plebeians being alike enrolled.
</p>
<p>98. Centuries. The tribes were originally divided into
</p>
<p>hundreds. The assembly of the centuries elected the higher
</p>
<p>officers of the state.
</p>
<p>100. CBASSUS, I, and CAESAR. / is here again the
</p>
<p>old affirmative 'aye.' Cf. i. 76: 'I, Plough up rocks.'
</p>
<p>105. A very orient one. Superior pearls and gems
</p>
<p>anciently coming from the East, the term orient became
</p>
<p>transferred to any jewel of marked lustre and beauty. Cf.
</p>
<p>Volpone [Wks. 3. 190): 'Is your pearl orient, sir?' Also,
</p>
<p>Herrick, Corinna's Going A-Maying:
</p>
<p>Besides, the childhood of the Day has kept.
</p>
<p>Against you come, some Orient pearls unwept.

<p>There are competitors. 'Sex competitores in consulatus

<p>means particles of food which tend to decay the teeth, I can

<p>find no satisfactory definition for it in this sense, however,
</p>
<p>unless we consider its use here a broadening of that to denote
</p>
<p>undigested or indigestible foods.
</p>
<p>156. Seruant. This word, meaning 'lover,' is very
</p>
<p>common in the old dramatists. Cf. Every Man Out (Wks.
</p>
<p>I. 118) :
</p>
<p>BRISK. A second good-morrow to my fair mistress.
</p>
<p>SAVOLINA. Fair servant, I'll thank you a day hence.

<p>Also, The Case is Altered {Wks. 6. 334) : ' Come, I will not

</p>
<p>170. Your noble Faunes. The fauns were regarded as
</p>
<p>patrons of cattle-breeding.
</p>
<p>180. Cob-swan. A male swan, not a 'large swan/ as
</p>
<p>G. supposed. Cf. Browning, Sordello 2. 320 : 'Out-soar them,
</p>
<p>cobswan of the silver flock ! '
</p>
<p>182. DANAE. To woo Danae, Jove disguised himself
</p>
<p>as a golden shower. Leda and Europa, mentioned just
</p>
<p>before, were also loves of Jove.
</p>
<p>184. Or ten such thundring gamsters. In the dramatis
</p>
<p>persons of The Alchemist, Surly is called a gamester. Tom
</p>
<p>Quarlous, in the dramatis persorue of Bartholomew Fair, has
</p>
<p>the same title. In both cases the meaning seems to be
</p>
<p>'a rake, a wild young dog.' Shakspere applies it to loose
</p>
<p>women. Cf. All's Well 5. 3. 188 :

<p>exactness in adapting his oaths to his speakers. GeUius
</p>
<p>ACT II] Notes 159
</p>
<p>tells us, that, amongst the Romans, the women never swore
</p>
<p>by Hercules, nor the men by Castor. "Nusquam in venire
</p>
<p>est apud idoneos quidem scriptores, aut mehercle feminam
</p>
<p>dicere, aut mecastor virum. Aedepol autem, quod jusjuran-
</p>
<p>dum per Pollucem est, et viro et feminae commune est "
</p>
<p>(11. 6). Accordingly, in the next scene, Curius swears by
</p>
<p>Pollux, and Fulvia, as the women should do, by Castor.'  W.
</p>
<p>214. And in disposition. In good health, possibly a
</p>
<p>Gallicism. Cf. Twelfth Night 3. i. 146 :
</p>
<p>Grace and good disposition
</p>
<p>Attend your ladyship.
</p>
<p>248  265. This passage is taken from Ovid, Ars Ama-
</p>
<p>toria 3. 601 ff. :
</p>
<p>Incitat et ficti tristis custodia servi
</p>
<p>Et nimium duri cura molesta viri.
</p>
<p>Quae venit ex tuto, minus est accepta voluptas:
</p>
<p>Ut sis liberior Thaide, finge metus !
</p>
<p>Cum melius foribus possis, admitte fenestra
</p>
<p>Inque tuo vultu signa timentis habe;
</p>
<p>Gallida prosiliat dicatque ancilla 'perimus!'
</p>
<p>Tu iuvenem trepidum quohbet abde loco!
</p>
<p>262. Wasrter. A waiting woman. Cf. Massinger, Unnat-
</p>
<p>ural Combat i. i : ' Bid your waiters stand further off, and
</p>
<p>I'll come nearer to you.'
</p>
<p>267. Both eyes and beake seal'd vp. Cf. Juvenal, Sat.
</p>
<p>I- 56. 57 :
</p>
<p>Doctus spectare lacunar,
</p>
<p>Doctus et ad calicem vigilante stertere naso.
</p>
<p>Seal'd. There is reason to agree with G. that W.'s emen-
</p>
<p>dation to seel'd is justifiable. 'Seeling,' says G., quoting the
</p>
<p>Gentleman's Recreation, 'is when a hawk first taken is so
</p>
<p>blinded with a thread run through the eyelids that she sees
</p>
<p>not or very little, the better to make her endure the hood.'

<p>275. Brokers. Panders were commonly termed 'brokers.'
</p>
<p>Cf. Troilus and Cressida 5. 10. 33 : 'Hence, broker, lackey !'
</p>
<p>278. The tragick visor. Actors in tragedy in the classical
</p>
<p>age wore a mask covering the head to the shoulders, with a
</p>
<p>wig usually attached.
</p>
<p>Lady CYPRIS. Cf. Masque of Hymen {Wks. 7. 68) :
</p>
<p>Nor may your murmuring loves
</p>
<p>Be drown 'd by Cypris' doves.
</p>
<p>Jonson 's own note to this passage runs : 'A frequent
</p>
<p>surname of Venus, not of the place as Cypria ; but quod
</p>
<p>parere faciat, /; to Kvliv IlaQexovOa, Theop. Phurnut and
</p>
<p>the grammarians upon Homer, see them.' Cyprus was an
</p>
<p>important seat of the worship of Venus.
</p>
<p>283. Will LAIS turne a LUCRECE ? Lais was the name
</p>
<p>of two famous Greek courtesans. Lucrece was a Roman
</p>
<p>matron, whom Sextus Tarquinus, son of the king, forced at
</p>
<p>the point of the sword. She called her family together, and
</p>
<p>stabbed herself.
</p>
<p>305. I shall ha' you come about, againe. Cf. Cat. 4. 611 :
</p>
<p>They are come about, and wonne. The meaning of the
</p>
<p>idiom is most apparent in Epicoene 4. i {Wks. 3. 407) : 'I
</p>
<p>think, I shall come about to thee again' (that is, 'side with
</p>
<p>thee').
</p>
<p>307. By the faire entrailes of the matron's chests. The
</p>
<p>beautiful contents of the matrons' treasure-chests. For entrails
</p>
<p>in this sense, cf. Titus Andronicus 2. 3. 230 :
</p>
<p>Which like a taper in some monument, . . .
</p>
<p>Shows the ragged entrails of the pit.
</p>
<p>310. Promised mountaynes. ' Repente glorians maria mon-
</p>
<p>tesque polliceri coepit ' ; quoted supra from Sallust, Cat. 23.
</p>
<p>316. Under the spear at out cry. That is, at an open
</p>
<p>sale. The Roman mode of proclaiming an auction was
</p>
<p>setting up a spear, at the foot of which the goods were sold ;
</p>
<p>hence, as W. observes, the phrase 'sub hasta vendere.'

<p>Almost all the customs of this people were derived from the
</p>
<p>camp, where spoil taken from the enemy was originally
</p>
<p>ACT II] Notes i6i
</p>
<p>disposed of in this manner. Outcry is constantly used by
</p>
<p>our old writers for an auction. Thus Massinger, City
</p>
<p>Madam: 'The goods of this poor man sold at an outcry.'
</p>
<p>See also Killigrew, Parson's Wedding 2. 7 : 'To be bought
</p>
<p>or sold, or let  or else sold at out-crys.'
</p>
<p>Indeed, the person we now call an auctioneer was ancientl}'
</p>
<p>termed an outcrier. Thus Stowe : ' He caused the same to
</p>
<p>be cried throughe the citie by a man wyth a belle, and then
</p>
<p>to be solde by the common outcrier' (ed. 1581, p. 1123).
</p>
<p> G. N.E.D. observes the word in this use as late as 1848.
</p>
<p>Cf . Thackeray, Vanity Fair, p. 38 : ' (He) sold it at public
</p>
<p>outcry, at an enormous loss to himself.'
</p>
<p>320. Say, how you were wish'd ;
</p>
<p>And so, he left you. 'The reader, who reflects on
</p>
<p>what has passed between these lovers, will think this a very
</p>
<p>unintelligible expression ; but Mr. Theobald's margin purposes
</p>
<p>an emendation, and exhibits " witch 'd" as the most proper
</p>
<p>term.'  W. G. rightly considers this 'something worse than
</p>
<p>unnecessary.' It is a common failing to boast of what we
</p>
<p>might have had, and Jonson's picture of Fulvia as an aged
</p>
<p>spinster, looking o' her fingers, and toying with her cushion,
</p>
<p>is a delightful bit of satire.
</p>
<p>331. Couetise. Cf. Alchem. 2. i {Wks. 4. 60) : 'Why, this
</p>
<p>is Covetise ! '
</p>
<p>The word {N.E.D.) is derived from O.F. coveitise. Its ori-
</p>
<p>ginal meaning was 'lust, inordinate desire.' In this sense,
</p>
<p>N.E.D. quotes it as late as 1847. In its limited sense, as
</p>
<p>here, of covetousness, it has disappeared.
</p>
<p>332. Change that vnkinde conceipt. Cf . Chaucer, T. and C.
</p>
<p>I. 692: 'For-thi wolde I fayn remeue thy wrong conceyte.'
</p>
<p>The meaning is 'notion, thought.'
</p>
<p>344. As close as shells of cockles meet. The idea here
</p>
<p>expressed seemed to take Jonson's fancy. In Alchemist
</p>
<p>3. 2 {Wks. 4. 99) occurs this :

<p>Kiss, like a scallop, close.
</p>
<p>In Cynthia's Revels 5. 2 {Wks. 2. 33) :
</p>
<p>O, she kisses as close as a Cockle.
</p>
<p>1 62 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT II
</p>
<p>In The Staple of News 2. i [Wks. 5. 212) :
</p>
<p>They all kiss close, the last stuck to my lips.
</p>
<p>In The Masque of Hymen (Wks. 7. 68) :
</p>
<p>Then coin them 'twixt your lips so sweet,
</p>
<p>And let not cockles closer meet.
</p>
<p>The thought is from a little poem attributed to the emperor
</p>
<p>Gallienus :
</p>
<p>Non murmura vestra columbae,
</p>
<p>Brachia non hederae, non vincant osculae conchse.
</p>
<p> C G. This poem, Epithalamium, may be found in P.
</p>
<p>Burman's Anthologia Latinorum Epigrammatum et Poematum
</p>
<p>(Amsterdam, 1759) i. 684.
</p>
<p>345. Quite through
</p>
<p>Our subtle lips. 'That is, thin, fine lips. So Shake-
</p>
<p>speare : "Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground".'  W.
</p>
<p>'These "thin, fine" lips are none of Jonson's. His are  lips
</p>
<p>acquainted with the mystery of kissing : soft and balmy like
</p>
<p>those of Dame Pliant in the Alchemist :
</p>
<p>And subtlety of her lip, which must be tasted
</p>
<p>Often, to make a judgment (5. 4. : Wks. 4. 122)'  G.
</p>
<p>W.'s quotation is badly chosen, as 'subtle' there means
</p>
<p>smooth or level, but I think his definition better than G's
</p>
<p>fanciful one.
</p>
<p>348. Why, now my FVLVIA lookes, like her bright name.
</p>
<p>Fulvia means 'shining.' Jonson is continually playing on
</p>
<p>the names of the characters in his comedies. The play on
</p>
<p>Fulvia 's name is continued in 3534, infra.

</p>
<p>led the uprising that deposed Tarquin, following the rape
</p>
<p>of Lucrece. So high was his sense of duty that, while consul,
</p>
<p>he condemned his own sons to death for treason. See Livy,

<p>likewise at Sentinum, when fighting against the Gauls and
</p>
<p>Samnites. In the war against Pyrrhus and the Tarentines
</p>
<p>in B. C. 280, his son is said to have followed the same course
</p>
<p>See Livy 7. 21 ff., 8. 10.
</p>
<p>392. CIPI. Genucius Cipus was praetor. On his head
</p>
<p>horns suddenly sprouted as he was leaving the city. The
</p>
<p>haruspices declared this meant he would be king if he re-
</p>
<p>entered Rome. Hearing this, he went into exile for life
</p>
<p>voluntarily. See Ovid, Met. 15. 565. CURTII. In B. C.
</p>
<p>362, Mettus Curtius devoted himself for his country to the
</p>
<p>Manes. See Livy 7. 6.
</p>
<p>395. CAMILLI. M. Furius CamiUus, who, as a result
</p>
<p>of false charges of embezzlement, had gone into voluntary
</p>
<p>exile, was recalled when Rome was sacked by the Gauls
</p>
<p>under Brennus (it was at this time that the Capitol was
</p>
<p>saved by the cackling of the sacred geese), and made dictator.
</p>
<p>He defeated the Gauls, gained other important victories,
</p>
<p>and was five times dictator. So runs the legend. See
</p>
<p>Mommsen, Hist. Rome 2. 4.
</p>
<p>396. FABII. Q. Maximus Fabius Rullianus, in B. C. 324,
</p>
<p>in the absence of and against the orders of his superior
</p>
<p>officers, attacked and defeated the Samnites. He became
</p>
<p>five times consul and twice dictator (see Livy, Hist. 8. 28 ff.).

</p>
<p>P. Cornelius Scipio was consul in 218 B. C, and distinguished
</p>
<p>himself in the second Punic war, where he met his death.
</p>
<p>His son, Publius, was the famous conqueror of Hannibal.
</p>
<p>394. Men, good, only for a yeere. Cf. Horace, Od. 4. 9.
</p>
<p>39: 'Consulque non unius anni.'
</p>
<p>ACT HI
</p>
<p>CATO. Marcus Cato was the great-grandson of the
</p>
<p>famous censor. At this time he was but a young man. In
</p>
<p>the civil war between Pompey and Caesar, he sided with the
</p>
<p>former. After Pompey's death, he joined his army to that
</p>
<p>of Scipio and Labienus, only to experience a disastrous defeat
</p>
<p>at Thapsus. Rather than submit to Caesar, he committed
</p>
<p>suicide. This Cato is the hero of Addison's tragedy of that
</p>
<p>name. CATVLVS. Quintus Catulus was a distinguished
</p>
<p>leader of the aristocratic party, but one whose purity of
</p>
<p>personal life and patriotism were far superior to those of
</p>
<p>most of his associates. While censor with Crassus in 65 B. C,
</p>
<p>he resisted the latter 's attempt to seize Egypt. He was one
</p>
<p>of the commissioners to restore the Capitol, destroyed in
</p>
<p>83 B. C. during the civil war. Throughout his life he was at
</p>
<p>enmity with Caesar. ANTONIVS. Caius Antonius was a
</p>
<p>man of rather questionable character. He accompanied
</p>
<p>Sulla in the war against Mithridates, and, being left in Greece,
</p>
<p>plundered the country. In 70 B. C. he was expelled from the
</p>
<p>senate by the censors for oppression of the aUies and profligacy,
</p>
<p>but was soon after readmitted. He was praetor with Cicero
</p>
<p>in 65 B. C. and consul in 63 B. C. At the end of the war
</p>
<p>against Catiline, he went to Macedonia, which Cicero had
</p>
<p>given him (see note to line 477) , and plundered it so shame-
</p>
<p>lessly that his recall was proposed in the senate, 61 B. C. Cicero
</p>
<p>defended him. On his return in 59 B, C, he was accused
</p>
<p>both of a share in Catiline's conspiracy and of plundering,
</p>
<p>Cicero again defended him, but he was condemned on both
</p>
<p>counts, and banished, Cicero's defence of him lends color

<p>to the current report that the former had secretly arranged
</p>
<p>with Antony for a share of the spoil; and Antony himself
</p>
<p>ACT III] Notes 165
</p>
<p>stated such to be the case. CRASSVS, CAESAR. Crassus
</p>
<p>is so well known as to require but slight mention, on account
</p>
<p>of his connection with the first triumvirate. He was enor-
</p>
<p>mously wealthy, and one of the most prominent creditors
</p>
<p>in Rome. He had been connected by popular rumor with
</p>
<p>Catiline's alleged former conspiracy, and was naturally under
</p>
<p>suspicion at this time. Caesar needs no comment.
</p>
<p>The opening scene is entirely Jonson's own. Sallust,
</p>
<p>in Cat. 24, gives a passing reference to the confusion of the
</p>
<p>conspirators on Cicero's election, as does Plutarch in Cic. 14 ;
</p>
<p>but there is nothing in either author to suggest the spirited
</p>
<p>scene that follows. The language in 184, however, strongly
</p>
<p>resembles the harangue of Marius to the people when seeking
</p>
<p>recruits, as given in Sallust, Jugurtha 85.
</p>
<p>14. I haue no vrnes. The reference is to funeral-urns,
</p>
<p>cremation having long been the estabhshed funeral-rite
</p>
<p>among the aristocracy. Dustie moniments. Originally wax
</p>
<p>masks of the features of the ancestors of a family were set
</p>
<p>up in the atria or their alee. The masks were known as
</p>
<p>imagines (translated 'images ' in the next line by Jonson), and
</p>
<p>could be set up only by those who had borne a curule office,
</p>
<p>viz., from aedile upwards. Later, when the dwellings became
</p>
<p>more luxurious and magnificent, the imagines were no longer
</p>
<p>displayed openly, but kept in little closets, and in their
</p>
<p>places were set busts and shields. It is to these latter that
</p>
<p>moniments probably refers ; although there is a possibility
</p>
<p>that the armor or other preserved trophies of famous forbears
</p>
<p>may be meant. Cicero, being a novus homo, would have none
</p>
<p>of these things to show.
</p>
<p>15. Broken images. Cf. Juvenal, Sat. 8. 46 :
</p>
<p>Et Curios iam dimidios humerosque minorem
</p>
<p>Corvinum et Galbam auriculis nasoque car en tern.
</p>
<p>See note on 14, supra.

<p>{Wks. 3. 245) : ' I know it and dare undertake for her ' ;
</p>
<p>The Devil is an Ass 2. i {Wks. 5. 39) :
</p>
<p>He shall but be an undertaker with me
</p>
<p>In a most feasible business.
</p>
<p>21. Yo' haue cut a way, etc. Cf. Cicero, Pro Murena 8 :
</p>
<p>' Cum ego vero tan to intervallo claustra ista nobilitatis refre-
</p>
<p>gissem, ut aditus ad consulatum posthac, sicut apud maiores
</p>
<p>nostros fuit, non magis nobilitati, quam virtuti, pateret.'
</p>
<p>22. And I would make those, your complexion. The
</p>
<p>antecedent of those is better lookes, and thoughts in 320. See
</p>
<p>Glossary. Cf. Much Ado 2. i. 305 : 'Something of a jealous
</p>
<p>complexion.'
</p>
<p>26. In my iust yeere. Under ordinary circumstances,
</p>
<p>according to the fixed rules for accession to office, a man
</p>
<p>would be forty three on reaching the consulship : this was
</p>
<p>Cicero's age.
</p>
<p>29. Loud consents. So Cicero, In Pisonem: 'Me cuncta
</p>
<p>Italia, me ordines, me universa civitas, non prius tabella
</p>
<p>quam voce priorem consulem declaravit.'
</p>
<p>30. Silent bookes. These, referred to in quotation, supra,
</p>
<p>as 'tabellse,' were the voting tablets. They were of wax,
</p>
<p>blank, and the voters filled in the desired names.
</p>
<p>34. Counsell. Opinion. Cf. Cat. 4. 280.
</p>
<p>36. Two things, etc. Cf. Sallust, Jug. 85 : ' Quo mihi
</p>
<p>acrius adnitundum est, uti neque vos capiamini et illi frustra
</p>
<p>sint.'
</p>
<p>37. Nor you repent you. The reflexive use of this verb is
</p>
<p>frequent in the Hterature of the time. Cf. Ps. 135. 14: 'He
</p>
<p>will repent himself concerning his servants.'
</p>
<p>54. I know, 'twas this, etc. 'Ea res in primis studia
</p>

<p>61. The voice of Rome is the consent of heaven! Vox
</p>
<p>populi, vox Dei' (Latin proverb).
</p>
<p>62. At the hehne. Horace, in Od. i. 14, refers to the 'ship
</p>
<p>of state.' Cicero himself uses the figure often. In Pro
</p>
<p>Murena 35, Cato is represented as saying, 'Tu gubernacula
</p>
<p>reipubhcce petas ' ; in Pro. Mur. 2, Cicero speaks of Murena
</p>
<p>as the captain of a vessel about to encounter grievous storms ;
</p>
<p>in In Pisonem 9, occurs this : ' Neque tam fui timidus, ut,
</p>
<p>qui in maximis turbinibus ac fiuctibus reipubhcae navem
</p>
<p>gubernassem, salvamque in portu coUocassem'; and in
</p>
<p>2 Phil. 44 is this : 'Habet populus Romanus ad quos guber-
</p>
<p>nacula reipublicse deferat.'
</p>
<p>64. Each pelty hand, etc. Cf. Seneca. Epistul. Mor.
</p>
<p>12. 3. 34:
</p>
<p>' Non tamquam [tempestas] gubernatori, sed tam-
</p>
<p>quam naviganti nocet. Alioquin gubernatoris artem
</p>
<p>adeo non inpedit, ut ostendat: tranquillo enim, ut
</p>
<p>aiunt, quilibet gubernator est. Navigio ista ob-
</p>
<p>sunt, non rectori eius, qua rector est.'
</p>
<p>66. Goueme. Although perfectly intelligible in its sense
</p>
<p>of 'control,' this word was probably used by Jonson because
</p>
<p>of its suggestion of the Latin guberno, 'to pilot.'
</p>
<p>80. A day, an hour is left me. W. thought the con-
</p>
<p>struction obscure, and proposed to emend to 'Each day and
</p>
<p>hour is left me.' It is, however, perfectly clear if we supply
</p>
<p>the relative that after hour  supplying an omission very
</p>
<p>common not only in the old writers but in modern poets as
</p>
<p>well. See Abbott, Shakes. Gram.  244.
</p>
<p>83. The vicious count their yeeres, etc. A Latin verse,
</p>
<p>of unknown authorship, runs :
</p>
<p>Sat vixit, bene qui vixit spatium brevis sevi ;
</p>
<p>Ignavi numerant tempore, laude boni.

<p>one immortal. See Hesiod, Theog. 313 ff.
</p>
<p>loi. To fit their properties, etc. 'Having called the
</p>
<p>i68 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT III
</p>
<p>consul "an Herculean actor in the scene," he continues the
</p>
<p>metaphor in terms taken from the stage. All necessaries
</p>
<p>in the performance of a play, are called properties ; and the
</p>
<p>sense is, that it will cost him as much pains to get the proper
</p>
<p>implements and material for his scheme, as to act his own
</p>
<p>part in it.'  W. The word 'properties,' says Collier, Hist.
</p>
<p>Eng. Dram. Poetry 3. 250, was 'technically apphed to the
</p>
<p>appurtenances of the stage as early as the year 1511.'
</p>
<p>113. And made Praetor. A person expelled from the
</p>
<p>Senate could be readmitted only by an election as praetor.
</p>
<p>Lentulus, as has been noted, had been expelled for profligacy.
</p>
<p>See Plutarch, Cic. 17.
</p>
<p>120123. It did not please the gods, etc. Cf. Juvenal,
</p>
<p>Sat. 10. 346-351:
</p>
<p>Si consilium vis,
</p>
<p>Permittes ipsis expendere numinibus quid
</p>
<p>Conveniat nobis rebusque sit utile nostris.
</p>
<p>Nam pro iucundis aptissima quaeque dabunt di.
</p>
<p>Carior est illis homo, quam sibi.
</p>
<p>'The hypocritical language of Catiline,' says G., 'is artfully
</p>
<p>assumed to deceive Q. Catulus, and the consul Antonius, of
</p>
<p>whose good opinion and assistance he stood in need.'  But
</p>
<p>why need to deceive Antonius, when we have been led to
</p>
<p>believe that CatiUne has already sounded him about the plot,
</p>
<p>and found him amenable ?
</p>
<p>137. To stomack your repulse. To resent your defeat.
</p>
<p>Cf. Antony and Cleopatra 3, 4. 12 :
</p>
<p>Believe not all, or, if you must believe,
</p>
<p>Stomach not all.
</p>
<p>138. Sir, shee brookes not me. There is a play on words
</p>
<p>here. Brook in both its uses in this line means 'endure.'
</p>
<p>When Catiline is accused, according to common rumor, of
</p>
<p>enduring his defeat ill, he replies that public report does not
</p>
<p>endure him. The shee is doubtless due to the feminine of

<p>the Latin Fama.
</p>
<p>159. Woodden god. The god of gardens was Priapus,
</p>
<p>ACT III] Notes 169
</p>
<p>whose statue was usually of wood and often had to serve as
</p>
<p>a scarecrow. See Horace, Sat. i. 8.
</p>
<p>166. ANTONIVS wan it but by some few voices. So
</p>
<p>Asconius, In Tog. Can. 22 : 'Antonius paucuhs centuriis
</p>
<p>Catihnam superavit.'
</p>
<p>172. Would it had burnt me vp. There seems to be an
</p>
<p>allusion here to the poisoned robe of Nessus, by which Hercules
</p>
<p>met his end. For the story, see Ovid, Met. 93. 157 ff.
</p>
<p>175. That I could reach the axell, where the pinnes are.
</p>
<p>There is a play on words here, the Latin for ' axle ' and ' axis '
</p>
<p>being the same, axis. The Roman belief was that the earth
</p>
<p>was supported on its axis: 'Terra axe sustinetur,' says
</p>
<p>Cicero {Tim. 10).
</p>
<p>179. Who would not fall, etc. Cf. Seneca, Thyestes
</p>
<p>882-885 :
</p>
<p>Vitae est avidus, quisquis non vult,
</p>
<p>Mundo secum pereunte mori.
</p>
<p>190. Make on, vpon the heads. Whalley's advisers would
</p>
<p>have had him emend this to make one, i. e., 'make a bridge.'
</p>
<p>The sense is 'hasten on, proceed.' Cf. Yorkshire Tragedy
</p>
<p>I. 8. 214: 'Up, up, and struggle to thy horse; make on.'
</p>
<p>Cf. also Cat. i. 143: 'As he would Goe on vpon the Gods.'
</p>
<p>Make on and go on, with upon, signify 'to rush forward with
</p>
<p>violence.'
</p>
<p>192. Of those remaine. For the omission of the relative,
</p>
<p>cf. 3. 80, and note.
</p>
<p>Then is't a prey, etc. Cf. Lucan, Phars. i. 150 i :
</p>
<p>Impellens quidquid sibi summa petenti
</p>
<p>Obstaret, gaudensque viam fecisse ruina.
</p>
<p>197. Would fetch downe new. The allusion is to Pro-
</p>
<p>metheus, who, for stealing fire from heaven, was riveted to Mt.
</p>
<p>Caucasus by Jove, and a giant bird sent to feed on his entrails
</p>
<p>(Hyginus, Fab. 143). By reversing the situation, Catiline
</p>
<p>pays Cethegus a most fulsome compliment.

<p>200. To tire. Tire, as applied to birds of prey, means
</p>
<p>170 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT III
</p>
<p>'to seize and feed on ravenously, tear apart, rend.' So
</p>
<p>Venus and Adonis 5556 :
</p>
<p>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast
</p>
<p>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone.
</p>
<p>204. Giants wane. The giants were the children of
</p>
<p>Gsea (Hesiod, Theog. 50, 185). They waged a severe
</p>
<p>contest with the gods, but were defeated. See note on
</p>
<p>5- 678.
</p>
<p>21922. The fire you speake of. See Cicero, Pro Mur.
</p>
<p>25 : ' Praesertim cum idem ille in eodem ordine paucis
</p>
<p>diebus ante, Catoni, fortissimo viro, iudicium minitanti,

<p>ac denuntianti, respondisset, si quod esset in suas fortunas

</p>
<p>230. These things, when they proceed not, they goe
</p>
<p>backward: 'Qui non proficit, deficit' (Latin proverb).
</p>
<p>235  241. Is there a heauen ? etc. There is a great
</p>
<p>similarity in expression here and in Lucan, Phars. 7. 445 ff. :
</p>
<p>Sunt nobis nulla profecto
</p>
<p>Numina ; cum casco rapiantur saecula casu,
</p>
<p>Mentimur regnare lovem. . . .

<p>Tarn lentus audis scelera ? tam lentus vides ?
</p>
<p>Ecquando saeva fulmen emittes manu,
</p>
<p>Si nunc serenum est ?
</p>
<p>243. His former drifts. For drift in the sense of scheme
</p>
<p>or plot, cf. Two Gentlemen of Verona 2. 6. 43 :
</p>
<p>Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift.
</p>
<p>As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift !
</p>
<p>24849. The last affection A high mind can put off.

<p>298. In conscience of the fact. Cf. Milton, P. L. 8. 502 :
</p>
<p>'Her vertue and the conscience of her worth.' (Conscience
</p>
<p>here = 'consciousness.') The words are practically Cicero's
</p>

<p>connection. Sallust first mentions Fulvia in Cat. 23, where
</p>
<p>she betrays the conspiracy, but not to Cicero, and before
</p>
<p>his election. Indeed, he says it was the uneasiness caused
</p>
<p>by her reports that led the people to turn to Cicero for
</p>
<p>172 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT III
</p>
<p>help, and elect him consul. Later, Cicero made use of Fulvia,
</p>
<p>for we find the following in Sallust, Cat. 26 : ' Namque a
</p>
<p>principio consulatus sui multa pollicendo per Fulviam ef-
</p>
<p>ficerat, ut Q. Curius, de quo paulo ante memoravi, consilia
</p>
<p>Catilinae sibi proderet.' These lines form the basis for the
</p>
<p>scene that follows.
</p>
<p>348. To shoot eyes at her. Cf, Volpone 5. 5. {Wks. 3. 305) :
</p>
<p>' That I could shoot mine eyes at him, like gunstones ! ' The
</p>
<p>same figure occurs in i Hen. VI 4. 7. 7980 :
</p>
<p>O were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,
</p>
<p>That I in rage might skoot them at your faces !
</p>
<p>353. Not wrought for time, etc. Suggested by Horace's
</p>
<p>famous lines {Od. 3. 30) : 'Exegi monumentum asre per-
</p>
<p>ennius,' etc.
</p>
<p>368. He, that is void of feare, may soone be iust. From
</p>
<p>Seneca, Octavia 441 : ' Justo esse facile est, cui vacat pectus
</p>
<p>metu.'
</p>
<p>372. I know, that he is comming. That is, that he is
</p>
<p>giving way to your wishes. So, in Volpone 2. 3 {Wks. 3. 222) :
</p>
<p>'I hear him coming.'  G.
</p>
<p>377. And FVLVIA come i' the rere, or 0' the by. Cf.
</p>
<p>New Inn {Wks. 5. 352) : 'You had it on the bye, and we
</p>
<p>observed it.'  C.
</p>
<p>379. Vantage. The verb 'profit,' 'gain.' Spenser has
</p>
<p>a similar use of it, F. ^. i. 4. 49 : 'Needlesse feare did never
</p>
<p>vantage none.'
</p>
<p>392 It is a weaknesse, etc. Cf. Publius Syrus, Sen. 616 :
</p>
<p>' Stultum f acit fortuna quem volt perdere ' ; also the Latin
</p>
<p>proverb: 'Quem dei volunt perdere prius dementant.'
</p>
<p>406. Comisaile. Advice. Cf. Cat. 4. 313, and 5. 547.
</p>
<p>434435. The dignitie of truth is lost, With much pro-
</p>
<p>testing. Cf . Hamlet 3. 2. 240 : ' The lady doth protest too
</p>
<p>much, methinks.'
</p>

</p>
<p>already occurred in 3. 90. It survives in this meaning
</p>
<p>among the Irish, where to 'wake' is specifically to watch a
</p>
<p>night with a corpse. 'Wake' is also used by the Irish as a
</p>
<p>ACT III] Notes 173
</p>
<p>noun, to denote the vigil. For its use as 'watch,' cf. Moore,
</p>
<p>The Gamester i. i : ' 'T was misery enough to wake for him
</p>
<p>till then.'
</p>
<p>464. They helpe thee by such aides, as geese. See note
</p>
<p>on 2. 395.
</p>
<p>476477. And bestow The prouince on him. This fact
</p>
<p>is noted in Plutarch, Cic. 12. The province was the rich one
</p>
<p>of Macedonia. As Antonius' only anxiety was his debts,
</p>
<p>this arrangement effectually weaned him from the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Plutarch further states that Cicero did not even take the
</p>
<p>province of Gaul, allotted to him in place of Macedonia.
</p>
<p>Sallust, Cat. 26, also has a reference to an arrangement about
</p>
<p>the provinces, but is not so specific.
</p>
<p>480. So few are vertuous, when the reward's away. Cf.
</p>
<p>Juvenal, Sat. 10, 141 2 :
</p>
<p>Quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam,
</p>
<p>Praemia si tollas?
</p>
<p>CAESAR, CATILINE. Gifford undoubtedly erred in plac-
</p>
<p>ing this scene in Catiline's house. Cicero in i Cat. 4, and
</p>
<p>Pro Sulla 18, and SaUust in Cat. 27 and 28, mention the
</p>
<p>meeting as having taken place at Lecca's house. So also
</p>
<p>Jonson, in Cat. 4. 264. Sallust's words are, 'Rursus in-
</p>
<p>tempesta nocte coniurationis principes convocat per M. Por-
</p>
<p>cium Laecam.' There is no evidence that Caesar ever visited
</p>
<p>Catiline, or had any share in this conspiracy ; although he
</p>
<p>was suspected, because the gossip of the day had it that
</p>
<p>he and Crassus had been deeply implicated in Catiline's
</p>
<p>alleged former plot. Caesar's name, however, is throughout
</p>
<p>connected with that of Catiline on very slender grounds,
</p>
<p>mainly on the untrustworthy evidence of his political op-
</p>
<p>ponents.
</p>
<p>491. Ille therefore end in few. 'I'll end in a few words.'
</p>
<p>Cf. Milton, P. L. 10. 157 : 'He thus to Eve in few.'

<p>the clouds.'

<p>523, 524. A serpent, ere he comes to be a dragon, Do's
</p>
<p>eat a bat. This is the Greek proverb, ' Unless a serpent
</p>
<p>eat a serpent, he will not become a dragon,' which, Erasmus
</p>
<p>says, savours, to him, a little of vulgarity. In Dryden's
</p>
<p>(Edipus occurs this passage {Wks., ed. Scott-Saintsbury,

<p>6. 174) :
</p>
<p>A serpent n'er becomes a flying dragon
</p>
<p>Till he has eat a serpent.

<p>ism of phrasing here and in John 3. 27 ('Then said Jesus unto

</p>
<p>and the connotation achieved is as striking as it is subtle.

<p>552. Piso is dead, in Spaine. Piso had been sent to
</p>
<p>Spain, on the breaking up of Catihne's first conspiracy, so
</p>
<p>gossip ran, by the state, to keep him where he could do no
</p>
<p>mischief. He was murdered (Sallust, Cat. 19) on his way
</p>
<p>to his province by a body of Spanish horse in his command ;
</p>
<p>in revenge for his barbarity to them, according to one account,
</p>
<p>at the instigation of Pompey, according to another.
</p>
<p>554. He too's comming backe. Pompey 's return at this
</p>
<p>time from his great campaign was being rumored, says
</p>
<p>Plutarch {Cic. 18).
</p>
<p>557561. This information is given in Sallust, Cat. 27 :
</p>
<p>'Igitur C. Manlium Faesulas atque in eam partem Etruriae,
</p>
<p>Septimium quendam Camertem in agrum Picenum, C. Julium
</p>
<p>in Apuliam dimisit.' Manlius had been an officer in the army
</p>
<p>of Sulla, and, having been distinguished for his services, had
</p>
<p>been placed at the head of a colony of veterans at Fsesulae,
</p>
<p>but had squandered his property in extravagance.
</p>
<p>563. Behold this siluer eagle. Sallust, Cat. 59 mentions
</p>
<p>this as the standard of Marius. Cicero mentions it at least
</p>
<p>twice (i Cat. 9) : 'A quo etiam aquilam illam argenteam,
</p>
<p>quam tibi, ac tuis omnibus perniciosam esse confido, et
</p>
<p>funestam futuram, cui domi tuas sacrarium scelerum tuorum
</p>
<p>constitutum fuit, sciam esse praemissam ' ; (2 Cat. 6) : ' Cum
</p>
<p>aquilam illam argenteam, cui ille etiam sacrarium scelerum
</p>
<p>domi suae fecerat, scirem esse praemissam. ' The eagle gradual-
</p>
<p>ly displaced the boars, wolves, and dragons, which the aimies
</p>
<p>had formerly borne, and became the national standard.
</p>
<p>Pompey used it almost exclusively, and Caesar captured

<p>nearly sixty eagles at Pharsalia.

<p>issent bello civili cruentum fore' (Sallust, Cat. 67). Cicero,
</p>
<p>3 Cat. 4, gives the same information. See also note on i. 135.
</p>
<p>584. Me thinkes our lookes, are not so quicke and high.
</p>
<p>Sallust, Cat. 27, states that at this meeting, Catiline com-
</p>
<p>176 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT III
</p>
<p>plained greatly of his followers' apathy: 'Ibique multa de
</p>
<p>ignavia eorum questus.'
</p>
<p>585. No ? Whose is not ? 'This is artful. Curius, who
</p>
<p>is conscious of his treachery, is quick to avert suspicion.'  G.
</p>
<p>597. I think the Saturnalls. Cicero, in 3 Cat. 7, and
</p>
<p>Plutarch, in Cic. 18, name this as the date set by the con-
</p>
<p>spirators. The Saturnalia occurred about the eighteenth
</p>
<p>of December, and many of the celebrations survive in the
</p>
<p>modem Christmas. The feast was one of absolute relaxation
</p>
<p>and merriment. Business houses, law courts, and schools
</p>
<p>were closed. Special indulgences were granted to slaves :
</p>
<p>they were relieved from all ordinary toil ; were permitted to
</p>
<p>wear the pilleus, or badge of freedom ; were granted full
</p>
<p>freedom of speech ; and were guests at a banquet, attired in
</p>
<p>clothes of their masters, with their masters waiting upon them
</p>
<p>at the table (see Macrobius, Sat. i. 7, 10 ; Dio Cassius, Hist.
</p>
<p>Romero. 19). The cunning of Catiline in selecting this day
</p>
<p>is evident ; and the city would be in still further security
</p>
<p>because it was deemed sacrilege to begin a war during the
</p>
<p>feast. 'Twill be too long. Cethegus was constantly urging
</p>
<p>action, says Sallust, Cat. 43 : ' Inter hasc parata atque decreta
</p>
<p>Cethegus semper querebatur de ignavia sociorum ; illos
</p>
<p>dubitando et dies prolatando magnas opportunitates corrum-
</p>
<p>pere ; facto, non consult, in tali periculo opus esse, seque, si
</p>
<p>pauci adjuvarent, langeuntibus aliis, impetum in curiam
</p>
<p>facturam. Natura ferox, vehemens, manu promptus erat ;
</p>
<p>maximum bonum in celeritate putabat.'

</p>
<p>have part in it, and that the firing was to be done in twelve
</p>
<p>places, is found in Sallust, Cat. 43 : ' Statihus et Gabinius
</p>
<p>uti cum magna manu duodecim simul opportuna loca urbis
</p>
<p>incenderent' (Plutarch, Cic. 18, says it was to be done in a
</p>
<p>ACT III] Notes 177
</p>
<p>hundred places). That combustibles were laid in at Cethegus'
</p>
<p>house is told by Plutarch, Cic. 18 : 'The night appointed for
</p>
<p>the design was one of the Saturnalia ; swords, flax, and
</p>
<p>sulphur they carried and hid in the house of Cethegus.'
</p>
<p>From the same source we learn of the plan to stop the
</p>
<p>conduits, etc. : ' Others were appointed to stop up the
</p>
<p>aqueducts, and to kill those who shoulrl endeavor to carry
</p>
<p>water to put it out.'
</p>
<p>643. To seize his sonnes. This information is given
</p>
<p>in Plutarch, Cic. 18 : 'Lentulus . . . designed ... to spare
</p>
<p>nobody, except only Pompey's children, intending to
</p>
<p>seize and keep them as pledges of his reconcihation with
</p>
<p>Pompey.'

</p>
<p>proficisci cupere, si prius Ciceronem oppressisset ; eum suis
</p>
<p>consiliis multum obficere ' (SaUust, Cat. 27).
</p>
<p>661. Yet. 'This word is not well understood by modern
</p>
<p>critics, who seem to consider it, in such expressions as this
</p>
<p>before us, as little more than an expletive. It has, however,
</p>
<p>a meaning, and a very good one, though it may be difficult to
</p>
<p>define it precisely. It seems to have somewhat of the force
</p>
<p>of "notwithstanding," "nevertheless," &c., and can only be
</p>
<p>felt in all its force by those who have diligently studied our
</p>
<p>old writers, far better judges of the euphony as well as the
</p>
<p>power of language than ourselves.'  G.
</p>
<p>662679. Plutarch, in Cic. 16, says that Catiline ordered
</p>
<p>Marcius and Cethegus to kill Cicero, under pretext of morning
</p>
<p>visitation. On this account, in his effort to be true to all
</p>
<p>authorities, Jonson introduces Cethegus, accounting lamely
</p>
<p>for his defection, in line 799 of this Act, by the remark of
</p>
<p>Vargunteius, 'He has left it since he might not do't his way.'
</p>
<p>The circumstances in the text are mainty from Sallust, Cat.

<p>663. He shall die, etc. From Seneca, Her. Fur. 642645 :
</p>
<p>Si novi Herculem
</p>
<p>Lycus Creonti debitas poenas dabit.
</p>
<p>Lentum est dabit : dat ; hoc quoque est lentum : dedit.
</p>
<p>669. And vnder the pretext of Clientele. Originally,
</p>
<p>a stranger settling in Rome, unable to obtain citizenship,
</p>
<p>attached himself as client to some patrician patron, the
</p>
<p>relation thus established being known as clientela. The
</p>
<p>clients gathered in the morning to greet their patron with
</p>
<p>the pohte 'Ave.' At this time, the morning visit was more
</p>
<p>complimentary than anything else, implying little obligation
</p>
<p>on either side, and resembling most closely the levee of men
</p>
<p>in authority, so aften pictured in our earlier novels.
</p>
<p>695. As TARQVINE did the poppy heads. Sextus, son
</p>
<p>of L. Tarquinius Superbus, having gained admittance to
</p>
<p>Gabii by a ruse, sent a messenger to his father asking advice
</p>
<p>as to the best method of delivering the city. His father
</p>
<p>said nothing, but walked up and down, striking off with a
</p>
<p>stick the heads of the tallest poppies. Sextus took the hint,
</p>
<p>and had the chief men put to death. See Livy, Hist. i. 54.
</p>
<p>702. Make haste, and bid him get his guards about him.
</p>
<p>So Sallust, Cat. 28: 'Curius ubi intellegit quantum periculi
</p>
<p>consuli impendeat, propere per Fulviam dolum qui parabatur
</p>
<p>enunciat.' Plutarch merely states that Fulvia warned
</p>
<p>Cicero, telling him especially to beware of Cethegus.
</p>
<p>723. My stale, with whom I stalke. Cf. Tempest, 4. i.
</p>
<p>187: 'Go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves.'

<p>The allusion, says G., is to an animal, or representation of
</p>
<p>one, under cover of which the fowler stalks unseen, till he
</p>
<p>gets within a convenient distance of his game. In its broader
</p>
<p>sense, stale is a decoy of any sort. Cf. New Inn, dramatis

</p>
<p>dering of certain of Cicero's own words, as found in the

<p>Catilinarian orations: 'Muta jam istam mentem . . . obli-

<p>(i Cat. 4). 'Ne illi vehementer errant, si illam meam pristi-
</p>

<p>(2 Cat. 10).

<p>ALLOBROGES. A people of ancient Gaul, principally

<p>settled in Savoy and part of Dauphiny. They were an

<p>unquiet and mutinous people, and their deputies were now at

<p>Rome, with a complaint against their governor, L. Murena,
</p>
<p>which the senate had refused to hear. Hence the ill humor

<p>THE SENATE. This scene is based on the last half of

<p>Sallust, Cat. 31 :
</p>
<p>'At Catilinse crudelis animus eadem ilia movebat, tametsi

<p>reipublicae, quam postea scriptum edidit. Sed ubi ille assedit,
</p>
<p>Catilina, ut erat paratus ad dissimulanda omnia, demisso
</p>
<p>vultu, voce supplici postulare, "Patres conscripti ne quid de

<p>is a piece of throat-armor. The circumstance in the text is
</p>
<p>mentioned by Plutarch, Cic. 14, but as having occurred at
</p>
<p>the elections, on the occasion of Catiline's second attempt
</p>
<p>to secure the consulship, at which time Silanus and Murena
</p>
<p>were elected. Cicero himself, in Pro Murena 26, has the
</p>
<p>following : ' Descendi in campum . . . cum ilia late insignique
</p>
<p>lorica . . . ut omnes boni animadverterent, et, cum in metu

</p>
<p>118. A man . . . o no meane house. See note on i. 83.
</p>
<p>Cf. Acts 21. 39: 'But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus, in
</p>
<p>Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city.'
</p>
<p>122126, Almost literally from Q. Cicero, De Pet. Con.
</p>
<p>2. 9: 'Natus in patris egestate, educatus in sororis stupris,
</p>
<p>corroboratus in caede civium, cuius primus ad rempublicam
</p>
<p>aditus (equitibus) R (omanis) occidendis fuit.'

</p>
<p>from him. That no one would sit by Catiline is recorded by

<p>150155. Cf. Cicero, Pro Mur. 25: 'Dixit duo corpora

<p>sine capite : huic, si ita de se meritum esset, caput se vivo

<p>non defutunim.' Also Plutarch, Cic. 14: '"What harm,"
</p>
<p>said he, "when I see two bodies, the one lean and consumptive
</p>
<p>with a head, the other great and strong without one, if I put
</p>
<p>a head to that body which wants one ?" '
</p>
<p>157. Remember who I am, etc. Cf. 'ne existimarent,
</p>
<p>sibi patricio homini,' etc., quoted on page 181.
</p>
<p>170. Ate. According to Hesiod, Ate was the daughter
</p>
<p>of Eris (Strife). She typifies infatuation, especially infat-
</p>
<p>uation with guilt as its cause and evil as its consequence.
</p>
<p>171462. These lines form in the main a rather close ren-
</p>
<p>dering of Cicero's first Catilinarian, with omissions of varying
</p>
<p>length. Jonson's method may be seen at a glance by a
</p>
<p>reference to the appendix on page 312. The parts omitted
</p>
<p>are there bracketed. For a discussion of Jonson as a trans-
</p>
<p>lator, see Introduction.

<p>214. The iawes ... 0! Hetruria. Etruria lay west of the
</p>
<p>river Tiber and the Apennines, extending to the sea, and
</p>
<p>included the valley of the Amo. The headquarters of
</p>
<p>Catiline's army was Faesulae, the modern Fiesole, situated
</p>
<p>on a hill three miles northeast of Florence.
</p>
<p>246. Was, on the fifth (the Kalends of Nouember). W.'s
</p>
<p>emendation is undoubtedly right, and the line should read :
</p>
<p>on the fifth 0' the Kalends of November. Q2 omits the parenthe-
</p>
<p>sis, but lacks the 0.' The Kalends, being the first day of the
</p>
<p>month, cannot possibly be reconciled with the fifth, except
</p>
<p>by reading as above.
</p>
<p>252. Against a publique reed. 'Reed here means "a
</p>
<p>public decree," "a warning that might be read." So Bacon
</p>
<p>in his translation of the First Psalm :
</p>
<p>Who never gave to wicked reed
</p>
<p>A yielding and attentive ear.'  C.
</p>
<p>The mesming in Bacon is rather 'advice.' I take reed here to

<p>524. CRASSVS, and this CAESAR here ring hollow.
</p>
<p>It has been mentioned before that Crassus and Caesar were
</p>
<p>both under suspicion of secretly favoring and abetting
</p>
<p>Catiline's schemes. Plutarch, Ccesar 7, mentions the suspi-
</p>
<p>cion as to Caesar, but attaches no great credence to it. Sallust,
</p>
<p>Cat. 48 and 49, mentions both Crassus and Caesar in this
</p>
<p>connection, but evidently disbelieves the evidence. As-
</p>
<p>conius Pedianus, in his comments on In Tog. Cand. {Argu-
</p>
<p>mentum), speaking of Catiline's and Antonius' candidacies
</p>
<p>for the consulship, says, 'Coierant enim (ambo, ut) Ciceronem
</p>
<p>consulatu deicerent, adiutoribus usi firmissimis M. Crasso
</p>
<p>et C. Caesare.' This however, is indefinite. At best, it
</p>
<p>means nothing more than that Caesar und Crassus preferred

<p>Catiline to Cicero, and there is in it no evidence that they
</p>
<p>knew of his plot. Many respectable Romans supported
</p>
<p>Catiline for office who would have been horrified had they
</p>
<p>known his designs (see Cicero, Pro Coelio 6). Suetonius,
</p>
<p>lulius 9, mentions some gossip of a conspiracy in which
</p>
<p>Caesar and Crassus were said to have been involved at the
</p>
<p>time of the former's aedileship, but no mention is made of
</p>
<p>Catiline. The whole stor}^ such as it is, rest as upon no
</p>
<p>better evidence than that of Tanusius, whom Seneca calls
</p>
<p>a fool ; Bibulus, whom Cicero termed spiteful ; and Curio,
</p>
<p>whom Cicero held very cheap. The only thing which lends
</p>
<p>any real color to the suspicion is Caesar's determined stand
</p>
<p>(on which all the authorities agree), in Act 5, against the
</p>
<p>execution of the plotters. That Caesar, however, and Crassus,
</p>
<p>too, would gladly have seen Catiline succeed up to a certain
</p>
<p>point, where they themselves might step in and seize control,
</p>
<p>can scarcely be doubted.

<p>founded B. C. 600. By reason of its friendship to Rome, it
</p>
<p>was allowed to preserve its autonomy, and to exercise un-

</p>
<p>SANGA. See note on 3. 40.
</p>
<p>600612. The basis for these lines is Sallust, Cat. 41 :
</p>
<p>'Sed AUobroges diu in incerto habuere, quidnam consilii
</p>
<p>caperent. In altera parte erat aes alienum, studium beUi,
</p>
<p>magna merces in spe victorise ; at in altera majores opes, tuta

</p>
<p>cuius patrocinio civitas plurimum utebatur, rem omnem, uti

<p>and the ambassadors : ' Umbrenus . . . requirere coepit,

<p>Gallia negotiatus erat, plerisque principibus civitatium notus
</p>
<p>erat, atque eos noverat' (Sallust, Ca^. 40).
</p>
<p>619. A happy, wish'd occasion. This, and the next two
</p>
<p>lines, were evidently suggested by Cicero, 3 Cat. 2 : 'Facul-
</p>
<p>tatem mihi oblatam putavi, ut, quod erat difficillimum,
</p>
<p>quodque ego semper optabam ab dis immortalibus, tota res

</p>
<p>Cat. 40).
</p>
<p>635. To hazard certainties for aire. Cf. 'incerta pro
</p>
<p>certis' (Sallust, Cat. 14 and 20).
</p>
<p>640. The Senate haue decreed, etc. * Praeterea [senatus]

<p>642. And haue declar'd both him, and MANLIVS traytors.
</p>
<p>'Haec ubi Romae comperta sunt, senatus Catilinam et Manlium

</p>
<p>643-644. METELLVS CELER hath alreadie giuen Part
</p>
<p>of their troops defeate. Some of Catiline's lieutenants, whom
</p>
<p>he had sent to pave the way for trouble in the provinces,
</p>
<p>became over-hasty, and aroused suspicion by their nocturnal
</p>
<p>meetings and their transportation of armor and weapons.
</p>
<p>Q. Metellus Celer, the praetor, apprehended a number of
</p>
<p>these, and imprisoned them, under decree of the senate.
</p>
<p>No actual battle is mentioned, however. See Sallust, Cat. 42.

</p>
<p>CICERO, SANGA. Why G. should place this scene in
</p>
<p>the house of Brutus, where the conspirators are shortly to
</p>
<p>meet, I cannot imagine. It is evident that the consul's own
</p>
<p>home is meant. Line 674, We aretomeetanone, at BRVTVS
</p>
<p>house, shows clearly that this scene cannot be laid at the
</p>
<p>home of Brutus.
</p>
<p>673674. ALL. We are to meete anone, at BRVTVS house.
</p>
<p>CIC. WHO? DECIVS BRVTVS ? He is not in Rome.

<p>' Ille eos in domum D. Bruti perducit, quod foro propinqua
</p>

<p>682. I would haue yoji preuent. Anticipate, promise be-

</p>
<p>and Hippolyta. Poseidon sent a bull from the deep, which
</p>
<p>so terrified the horses of Hippolytus as he was driving on the

<p>shore, that they dragged him, hopelessly entangled in the

<p>reins, to death. See Hyginus, Fab. 47.
</p>
<p>755. CAPANEVS. Capaneus was one of the seven
</p>
<p>heroes who marched against Thebes. For daring to defy

<p>32. The second sort. This is Cicero's sixth and last
</p>
<p>class : ' Postremum autem genus est : . . . quod proprium est

<p>Catilinse, de ejus delectu, immo vero de complexu ejus, ac
</p>
<p>sinu . . . quorum omnis industria vitse et vigilandi labor in

</p>
<p>sed etiam sicas vibrare, et spargere venena didicerunt'
</p>
<p>(Cicero, 2 Cat. 10).

</p>
<p>Seu malis vetita legibus alea.
</p>
<p>43. And these will wish more hurt to you, then they
</p>
<p>bring you. From Cicero's description of his first class
</p>
<p>(2 Cat. 8) : ' Sed hosce homines minime puto pertimescendos,
</p>
<p>quod . . . magis mihi videntur vota facturi contra rempubli-
</p>
<p>cam quam arma laturi.'
</p>
<p>44. The rest are a mixt kind, &c. This description is
</p>
<p>partly from that of Cicero's fifth class, partly from that of
</p>
<p>his sixth. Cf. ' Quintum genus est parricidarum, sicariorum,
</p>
<p>denique omnium facinorosorum. ... In his gregibus omnes
</p>
<p>aleatores, omnes adulteri, omnes impuri impudicique versan-

<p>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,

<p>Or any other ground inhabitable.  W. {Richard II.

<p>198 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT V
</p>
<p>THE SENATE. This scene is taken largely from Cicero,
</p>
<p>3 Cat. 26, which was addressed to the people, not to the
</p>
<p>senate, relating the measures taken by the magistracy for
</p>
<p>the safet}^ of the state, and giving an account of a meeting of
</p>
<p>the senate just concluded.
</p>
<p>105. Breake these letters. The letters (Cicero, 3 Cat. 3)
</p>
<p>were delivered to the praetors unbroken on the arrest of the
</p>
<p>conspirators at the Milvian bridge, and Cicero would not
</p>
<p>consent to open them except in open senate.
</p>
<p>105108. Cf. 'etenim, Quirites, si ea quae erant ad me
</p>
<p>delata reperta non essent, tamen ego non arbitrar, in tantis
</p>
<p>reipublicae pericuUs, esse mihi nimiam dihgentiam pertimes-
</p>
<p>cendam' (Cicero, 3 Cat. 3).
</p>
<p>109. The weapons . . . from CETHEGVS house. 'C. Sul-
</p>
<p>picium praetorem . . . misi, qui ex aedibus Cethegi si quid
</p>
<p>telorum esset efferret : ex quibus ille maximum sicarum nume-
</p>
<p>rum et gladiorum extulit' (Cicero, 3 Cat. 3).
</p>
<p>117 118. Although the greatnesse of the mischief e . . .
</p>
<p>Hath often made my faith small. Cf . Cicero, 3 Cat. 2 : ' Quo-
</p>
<p>niam auribus vestris, propter incredibilem magnitudinem
</p>
<p>sceleris, minorem fidem faceret oratio mea.'
</p>
<p>119 129. Almost literally from Cicero, 3 Cat. 2: 'Nam
</p>
<p>tum, cum ex urbe CatiHnam ejiciebam (non enim jam vereor
</p>
<p>huius verbi invidiam, cum ilia magis fit timenda, quod vivus
</p>
<p>exierit) sed tnm, cum ilium exterminari volebam, aut reliquam
</p>

</p>
<p>ego, ut vidi quos maximo furore et scelere esse inflammatos

<p>133148. Sallust, Cat. 47, has the following: 'Voltur-
</p>
<p>cius interrogatus de itinere, de litteris, postremo quid aut de
</p>
<p>causa consilii habuisset, primo fingere alia, dissimulare de
</p>

<p>ACT V] Notes 199
</p>
<p>uti gesta erant, aperit docetque se paucis ante diebus a
</p>
<p>Gabinio et Caepario socium adscitum.' The main source
</p>
<p>of information here, however, seems to be Cic. 3 Cat. 4 :
</p>
<p>' Introduxi Volturcium . . . fidem pubhcam jussu senatus
</p>
<p>dedi : hortatus sum, et ea quae sciret sine timore indicaret.
</p>
<p>Tum ille dixit, cum vix se ex magno timore recreasset, ab
</p>
<p>Lentulo se habere ad Catihnam mandata et htteras, ut servo-
</p>
<p>rum praesidio uteretur, et ad urbem quam primum cum
</p>
<p>exercitu accederet : id autem eo consiho, ut, cum urbem ex
</p>
<p>omnibus partibus quem ad modum descriptum distributum-
</p>
<p>que erat incendisset, caedemque infinitam civium fecissent,
</p>
<p>praesto esset ille, qui et fugientis exciperet, et se cum his
</p>
<p>urbanis ducibus conjungeret.'
</p>
<p>148 151. For this speech of the Allobroges, cf. Cicero,
</p>
<p>3 Cat. 4 : ' Introducti autem Galli jus jurandum sibi et
</p>
<p>litteras ab Lentulo, Cethego, Statilio ad suam gentem data
</p>
<p>esse dixerunt, atque ita sibi ab his et a L. Cassio esse
</p>
<p>praescriptum, ut equitatum in Italiam quam primum mit-
</p>
<p>terent.'
</p>
<p>155167. 'Tabellas proferri jussimus, quae a quoque
</p>
<p>dicebantur datae. Primum ostendimus Cethego signum :
</p>
<p>cognovit. Nos linum incidimus : legimus . . . Tum Cethegus,
</p>
<p>qui paulo ante ahquid tamen de gladiis ac sicis, quae apud
</p>
<p>ipsum erant deprehensa, respondisset, dixissetque se semper
</p>
<p>bonorum ferramentorum studiosum fuisse, recitatis litteris
</p>
<p>debilitatus atque abjectus conscientia repente conticuit'
</p>
<p>(Cicero, 3 Cat. 5).
</p>
<p>168194. 'Introductus est Statilius: cognovit et signum

<p>ex Gabinio, P. Autronium, Ser. Sullam, L. Vargunteium,
</p>

</p>
<p>204. Where is thy visor? In its sense, as here, of 'pre-
</p>
<p>tence,' visor also appears in Epicoene, 2. 2 {Wks. 3. 367) :
</p>
<p>'Off with this vizor.'
</p>
<p>204209. 'Ita [Lentulum] non modo ingenium illud et

</p>
<p>vim sceleris manifesti atque deprehensi impudentia, qua
</p>
<p>superabat omnis, improbitasque defecit' (Cicero, 3 Cat. 5).
</p>
<p>210. The enginer of all. Cf. Cicero, 3 Cat. 3: 'Horum
</p>
<p>omnium scelerum improbissimum machinatorum Cimbrum
</p>
<p>Gabinium.'
</p>
<p>211. I know nothing, etc. ' Gabinius deinde introductus,
</p>
<p>cum primo impudentur respondere coepisset, ad extremum
</p>
<p>nihil ex eis quae Galli insimulabant negavit' (Cicero, 3 Cat. 5).
</p>
<p>214. Is there a law for't, etc. Cf. Martial, Epig. 2. 60 :

</p>
<p>247272. These lines follow closely, in parts so closely
</p>
<p>as to be virtually a translation, sections of Cicero, 4 Cat.
</p>
<p>Cf. 'Atque eo tempore hujus avus Lentuh, vir clarissimus,

</p>
<p>lius C. Carsari, Cabinius M. Crasso . . . traduntur.'
</p>
<p>289. Let LENTVLVS put off his Praetor-ship, it was
</p>
<p>contrary to law, or at least to custom, to imprison one of the
</p>
<p>higher officers during his tenure of office. See Cicero, 3 Cat. 6 :
</p>
<p>'Nam P, Lentulus, . . . quamquam patefactis indiciis, con-

</p>
<p>. . . frequentissimo senatu parentem patriae nominavit ' (Cicero,
</p>
<p>In Pis. 3). In Plutarch, Cic. 22, the people hail Cicero as
</p>
<p>'savior and founder of his country.' This was after the death
</p>
<p>of the conspirators. In Plutarch, Cic. 23, Cato calls him
</p>
<p>'father of his country.' Appian, Civil Wars 2. i. 7, also
</p>
<p>states that it was Cato who first caused Cicero to be called
</p>
<p>by the title in the text. This also was after the conspirators
</p>
<p>had been executed.

<p>of this fact has been overlooked by most of the authorities.

<p>never before happened from any such cause.'
</p>
<p>337. Here's one TARQVINIVS taken. The incident of
</p>
<p>Tarquinius, including Crassus' charge that Cicero invented
</p>
<p>the whole matter himself, is given in Sallust, Cat. 48 : ' Post
</p>
<p>204 Catiline his Conspiracy [ACT V
</p>
<p>eum diem quidam L. Tarquinius ad senatum adductus erat,
</p>
<p>quern ad Catilinam proficiscentem ex itinera retractum aie-
</p>
<p>bant . . . Praeterea se missum a M, Crasso, qui Catilinae
</p>
<p>nuntiaret, ne eum Lentulus et Cethegus aliique ex conjura-
</p>
<p>tione deprehensi terrerent, eoque magis properaret ad urbem
</p>
<p>accedere, quo et ceterorum animos reficeret et illi facilius e
</p>
<p>periculo eriperentur. Sed ubi Tarquinius Crassum nomina-
</p>
<p>vit, hominem nobilem, maxumis divitiis, summa potentia,
</p>
<p>alii rem incredibilem rati, pars tametsi verum existumabant,
</p>
<p>tamen quia in tali tempore tanta vis hominis magis leniunda
</p>
<p>quam exagitanda videbatur, plerique Crasso ex negotiis
</p>
<p>privatis obnoxii, conclamant indicem falsum esse, deque ea
</p>
<p>re postulant uti referatur. Itaque consulente Cicerone
</p>
<p>frequens senatus decernit, Tarquini indicium falsum videri,
</p>
<p>eumque in vinculus retinendum, neque amplius potestatem
</p>
<p>faciundam, nisi de eo indicaret, cujus consilio tantam rem
</p>
<p>esset mentitus. . . . Ipsum Crassum ego postea praedicantem
</p>
<p>audivi, tantam illam contumeliam sibi ab Cicerone impositam.'
</p>
<p>340. Some lying varlet. Varlet was originally a youth of
</p>
<p>noble or knightly birth, serving an apprenticeship in knightly
</p>
<p>exercises and accomplishments while awaiting knighthood ;
</p>
<p>hence (because such youths served as pages or personal ser-
</p>
<p>vants to the knights who had charge of them), a body-
</p>
<p>servant or attendant ; hence, any menial ; finally, a term of
</p>
<p>contempt or reproach, 'rascal, rogue.' The word survives
</p>
<p>in a changed sense in valet.  C. D.
</p>
<p>351. Here is a libell, too. Lihell originally was 'a httle
</p>
<p>book ' [libelltis, diminutive of liber) ; then a written paper
</p>
<p>of any sort. Specifically, in law (and it is in this sense that
</p>
<p>Jonson here uses it), it was a statement of the charge or
</p>
<p>charges on which a proseciition took place. The incident
</p>
<p>of Vectius, including the part of Curius in it, and the stoppage
</p>
<p>of the latter's pay, are given in Suetonius, lulius 17 : ' [Caesar]

<p>367420. The circumstances surrounding Catiline's speech
</p>
<p>to his army are given in Sallust, Cat. 57 : ' Sed Catihna
</p>
<p>postquam videt montibus atque copiis hostium sese clausum,
</p>
<p>in urbe res adversas, neque fugae neque prsesidi ullam spem,
</p>

</p>
<p>statuit cum Antonio quam primum confligere. Itaque
</p>
<p>contione advocata hujusce modi orationem habuit' (the
</p>
<p>speech follows). The speech itself is lifted almost bodily
</p>
<p>from Sallust, Cat. 58. I give it here complete as found in
</p>
<p>Sallust, bracketing the omissions made by Jonson :
</p>
<p>'Compertum ego habeo, milites, verba virtutem non
</p>
<p>add ere, neque ex ignavo strenuum neque fortem ex timido
</p>
<p>exercitum oratione imperatoris fieri. Quanta cujusque animo

<p>audacia natura aut moribus inest, tanta in bello patere solet.
</p>
<p>Quem neque gloria neque pericula excitant, nequidquam

</p>
<p>It will be noticed that Jonson does not follow exactly the
</p>
<p>order of Sallust. For instance, in 11. 37879, Jonson skips
</p>
<p>from ' Scitis quidem,' etc., to 'Nunc vero quo loco,' etc. ; but
</p>
<p>catches up the omitted passage in 11. 38085. Again, in
</p>
<p>11. 40309, he skips from 'Praeterea mihtes,' etc., to 'Licuit
</p>
<p>vobis,' etc., giving the substance of the omitted portion in
</p>
<p>11. 40910.
</p>
<p>381. Expect. 'Await' (Lat. exspecto). Cf. 563, infra.
</p>
<p>412 ff. Methinks I see Death, etc. ' The image here given
</p>
<p>is extremely sublime, and approaches very nearly to those

</p>
<p>a manner superior to any modern whatsoever.'  W.

</p>
<p>434. We haue done what we can. Sallust, Cat. 50, states
</p>
<p>that Cicero had distributed armed bands around the city.
</p>
<p>Dio Cassius, Hist. Rom. 37. 35, says that Cicero had the
</p>
<p>praetors administer the oath of enlistment to the people,
</p>
<p>so that they might instantly be called upon to act.

</p>
<p>new measure (see Appian, Civil Wars 2. 5). All the
</p>
<p>authorities state that it so happened in this case, but Jonson
</p>
<p>is undoubtedly following Sallust, Cat. 55, as 'designed' in

<p>the text echoes designatus in the Latin.

</p>
<p>516. I spake but as I thought. According to Plutarch,
</p>
<p>Cic. 21, Silanus did not apologize merely, but retracted his

<p>sentence of death. Suetonius, lulius 14, states that he

<p>qualified his opinion, trying to make it appear that it had

<p>578. Hold thee, drunkard. Take the letter. The Greek
</p>
<p>(Plutarch, Cat. Min. 24) reads, 'Take it, sot.' Plutarch
</p>
<p>says that Cato threw the letters back at Caesar with these
</p>
<p>words. For a similar use of hold, cf. AWs Well 4. 5. 46 :
</p>
<p>'Hold thee, there's my purse.' Thee is the dative. See

<p>into voluntary exile. The sentence of death was indeed, as
</p>
<p>Jonson states, awarded by the senate ; but this was not dee-

<p>Plutarch, Ccesar 8. Plutarch says that according to a
</p>
<p>current story the young knights would have kiUed Caesar, had
</p>
<p>Cicero given the nod of approval, but this he refused. Plu-

<p>tarch, however, considers this story as doubtful, since Cicero

</p>
<p>Caepario, eodem modo supplicium sumptum est.' There is
</p>
<p>in this no hint of the individuahty in the manner of meeting
</p>
<p>death that Jonson brings out.
</p>
<p>The account in Plutcirch, Cic. 22, differs shghtly in detail:
</p>
<p>'After this, Cicero went out with the senate to the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors ; they were not all together in one place, but the several
</p>
<p>praetors had them, some one, some another, in custody.
</p>
<p>And first he took Lentulus from the Palatine, and brought him
</p>
<p>by the Sacred Street, through the middle of the market-
</p>
<p>place, a circle of the most eminent citizens encompassing
</p>
<p>and protecting him. The people, affrighted at what was
</p>
<p>doing, passed along in silence, especially the young men. . . .
</p>
<p>Thus, passing from the market-place, and coming to the goal,
</p>
<p>he delivered Lentulus to the officer, and commanded him to
</p>
<p>execute him ; and after him Cethegus, and so all the rest in
</p>
<p>order, he brought and delivered up to execution.'
</p>
<p>593594. And let it be Said, he was once. 'The allusion
</p>
<p>is historical. In retufnijig from the prison, where the execu-
</p>
<p>tions took place, Cicero xobserved a number of suspicious
</p>
<p>characters collected in the Forum, on which he exclaimed
</p>
<p>aloud, "FUERUNT ! " and thus put an end to their machina-
</p>
<p>tions.' G. See Plutarch, Cic. 22.
</p>
<p>609. And call it happy Rome, thou being Consul. Cato
</p>
<p>has not much improved the poetry of his friend's memorable
</p>
<p>line, though he has avoided the jingle: "O fortunatam
</p>
<p>natam, me consule, Romam.'"  G.
</p>
<p>This line, probably from the De Suo Consulaiu, but possi-
</p>
<p>bly from the De Suis Temporibus, is satirically quoted by
</p>
<p>Juvenal, Sat. 10. 122.
</p>
<p>610. Great parent oJ thy countrie. See note on 5. 313.
</p>
<p>Cf . also Juvenal, Sat. 8. 243244 : ' Sed Roma parentem,

</p>
<p>Jonson supplies, however, are entirety lacking, and the
</p>
<p>author's reliance on any source here is but slight.
</p>
<p>623. In such warre, the conquest still is black. The
</p>
<p>thought seems to be taken from Lucan, Phars. 7. 1223 
</p>
<p>Omne malum victi, quod sors feret ultima rerum ;
</p>
<p>Omne nefas victoris erit.
</p>
<p>624. The house of Concord. This beautiful temple stood
</p>
<p>in the Forum, near the foot of the Capitol.
</p>
<p>629688. Sallust, Cat. 5961, gives a full account of
</p>
<p>this battle, in which Catiline was defeated and killed.
</p>
<p>630. Two armies. 'Exercitus hostium duo, unus ab

<p>633. Wherein the danger almost paiz'd the honor. Al-
</p>
<p>most all the later editions have poiz'd, which is not at all the
</p>
<p>same word. Paiz'd is from the Old French peser, 'to weigh,'
</p>
<p>and here means 'counterbalanced.' See Middleton, Family of
</p>

</p>
<p>the unequal scale of avarice.'

</p>
<p>651655. The thought here is very similar to a bit from
</p>
<p>Lucan, Phars. i. 100107 :
</p>
<p>Qualiter undas
</p>
<p>Qui secat et geminum gracilis mare separat Isthmos
</p>
<p>Nee patitur conferre fretum, si terra recedat,

</p>
<p>659. They knew not, what a crime their valour was. Cf.
</p>
<p>Lucan, Phars. 6. 147 :
</p>
<p>Et qui nesciret in armis
</p>
<p>Quam magnum virtus crimen civilibus esset.
</p>
<p>663. ENYO. A name given to Bellona, the goddess of

<p>war, who drove Mars' chariot. Here the word is war itself,
</p>
<p>personified .
</p>
<p>668. Couer'd that earth . . . with their trunks. ' Sed

<p>animi vis fuisset in exercitu Catilinae. Nam fere quem quis-
</p>
<p>que vivos pugnando locum ceperat, eum amissa anima
</p>
<p>corpore tegebat' (Sallust, Cat. 61).
</p>
<p>669689. Sallust gives the following account of Cati-
</p>
<p>line's death : 'Catilina postquam fusas copias seque cum
</p>
<p>paucis relictum videt, memor generis atque pristinse suae
</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Cf. this last passage especially, with 685 in the text.

<p>To be merrily spoken by M''^. Nell,

<p>In an Amazonian Habit.
</p>
<p>A Woman's prologue ! This is vent'rous News ;
</p>
<p>But we, a Poet wanting, Crav'd a muse.
</p>
<p>Why should our Brains lye fallow, as if they
</p>
<p>Without His fire, were mere Promethean Clay ?
</p>
<p>In Natur's Plain- Song we may bear our parts ;
</p>
<p>Although we want choise Descant from the Arts.
</p>
<p>Amongst Musicians ; so the Philomel
</p>
<p>May in Whild-Notes, though not in Rules excell.
</p>
<p>And when i' the weaker Vessel Wit doth lye ;
</p>
<p>Though into Froth it will work out and flye.
</p>
<p>But Gentlemen, you know our formal way,
</p>
<p>Although we're sure 'tis false, yet we must saj-,
</p>
<p>Nay Pish, Nay Fye, in troth it is not good.
</p>
<p>When we the while, think it not understood :
</p>
<p>Hither repair all you that are for Ben :
</p>
<p>Let th' House hold full. We're to carry 't then.

</p>
<p>And Ladies sure you'l vote for as entire,
</p>
<p>(This plot doth prompt the prologue to conspire)
</p>
<p>Such inoffensive Combination Can
</p>
<p>But show, who best deserve true worth in Man.
</p>
<p>And You, with Your great Author taking Part :
</p>
<p>May chance be thought, like him to know the Art,
</p>

</p>
<p>Vouchsafe then, as you look, to speak us fair,
</p>
<p>Let the Gallants dislike it, if they dare :
</p>
<p>They will so forfeit the repute of Judges,
</p>
<p>You may turn Am'zons, and make them Drudges,
</p>
<p>Man's claim to Rule is, in his Reason bred ;
</p>
<p>This masculine Sex of Brain may make you Head.
</p>
<p>'Tis real Skill, in the Right place to praise ;
</p>
<p>But more, to have the Wit, not to write Playes.

<p>The 'Mrs. Neir referred to was Nell Gwynn.
</p>
<p>At the end of the volume occurs this :
</p>
<p>The Epilogue.
</p>
<p>By the same.
</p>
<p>No Dance, no song, no Farce ? His lofty Pen,
</p>
<p>How e're we like it, doubtless wrote to Men.
</p>
<p>Height may be his, as it was Babel's fall ;
</p>
<p>There Bricklayers turn'd to Linguists ruin'd all.
</p>
<p>I'de ne're spoke this, had I not heard by many.
</p>
<p>He lik't one silent woman, above any :
</p>
<p>And against us had such strange prejudice ;
</p>
<p>For our applause, he scorned to write amiss,
</p>
<p>For all this, he did us, like wonders, prize ;
</p>
<p>Not for our Sex, but when he found us Wise.
</p>
<p>A Poet runs the Gantlet, and his slips.
</p>
<p>Are bare expos 'd to regiments of Whips ;
</p>
<p>Among those, he to Poetick Champions Writ ;
</p>
<p>As We to gain the Infancy of Wit.
</p>
<p>Which if they prove the greatest Number, then
</p>
<p>The House hath cause to thank Nell, more than Ben.
</p>
<p>Our Author might prefer your praise, perhaps,
</p>
<p>Wee'd rather have your Money, than your Claps.
