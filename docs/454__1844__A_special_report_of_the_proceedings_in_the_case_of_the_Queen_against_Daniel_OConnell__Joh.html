<p>PREFACE,
</p>
<p>Ix the year 1840 wns first, laid the foundation of what is now tlie Loyal Nation;il Repeal
</p>
<p>Association of Ireland. We had passed through six weary j-ears of expectancy. First tlie
</p>
<p>cry was for assimilation. They who were loudest in the call, forgot that perfect assimilatiou
</p>
<p>of laws and institutions could only produce similarity of advantages where tl)ere was au
</p>
<p>identity of liabits, manners, and circumstances. It is only justice to tlie people to say, tliat
</p>
<p>they placed no faitli in (his mode of political redemption, i'hey did, it is true, in consider-
</p>
<p>able numbers, memorial and petition tlie Legislature to carry out tlie demand made by those
</p>
<p>to Aviiom they were accustomed to look up to as leaders ; but it was always evident that the
</p>
<p>heart of the country was unmoved by those weak etforts to accomplish the changes neces-
</p>
<p>sarily antecedent to the attainment of national happiness. There was no living, animating,
</p>
<p>all-jiervading spirit in the agitation. A task was set the people, and they assumed it ; but
</p>
<p>they laboured without vigour, and without hope, in the weary endeavour to persuade them-
</p>
<p>selves that as Englishmen they could alone be free and happy.
</p>
<p>A "greater than Ca3>:ar" has said that there is in the Irish heart an intuilive love of the
</p>
<p>right, which corrects even the errors of their judgment. Tlie Irish heart is always right ; and
</p>
<p>heart as well as reason in that instance  the promptings of their, natural right-mindedness,
</p>
<p>as well as the accumulated teaching of seven centuries  had convinced them that they could
</p>
<p>find no happiness in being English.
</p>
<p>But there w^as a large section of the coraniunitj-, respectable in every sense, to whom
</p>
<p>assimilation was a purpose to be accomplished by all feasible means. That section included
</p>
<p>some of the most intelligent of the Irish Liberals, and their doctrine of regeneration was
</p>
<p>urged with great earnestness, and with more than proporiionate ability.
</p>
<p>Time, however, passed on, and no assimilation came. Some grew weary  others dis-
</p>
<p>trustful; some disheartened, and not a few convinced that their paths were not those which
</p>
<p>inevitably led to the goal tliey contemplated.
</p>
<p>The next change then came. The popular demand  the only demand at least which was
</p>
<p>popularly made, was, not for assimilation, the benefit of wliich now ceased to be insisted on,
</p>
<p>because English apathy, and English jealousy, and English hale refused to concede the
</p>
<p>principle  but the call was for a large and liberal concession to popular liberty, and of
</p>
<p>guarantees for its perpetuation. Thus we passed through another jihase of our political
</p>
<p>existence : urging, soliciting, and humbly entreatmg that we might be remembered, if not
</p>
<p>in justice, at least in mercy  whining out our unflagging patience, as at least preferring
</p>
<p>some claim to the consideration of those to whom we were practically as ell as publicly
</p>
<p>acknowledging our inferiority.
</p>
<p>But the efforts of the Irish Liberals in this direction were not more successful than in the

</p>
<p>more ambitious paths they had already trodden. No large concession was granted  no
</p>
<p>secure guarantee was given.
</p>
<p>The Whig opposition to the motion of Mr. O'Connell for an augmentation of the elective
</p>
<p>franchise, and an increase of the numljer of representatives of this country in the "Imperial
</p>
<p>Parliament," gave the coup de grace to the delusion of concession ; the enactment of the
</p>
<p>Municipal Retbrm Bill demolished the question of guarantees.
</p>
<p>The great leader of the Whig party  Lord John Russell  now tells us that, when his
</p>
<p>"noble collengue," Lord Morpeth, met the jiroposition of Mr. O'Connell upon the franchise,
</p>
<p>with a direct negative, both were convinced that justice required the concession demanded
</p>
<p>by the trusted leader of the Irish people. Then they flatly denied that which they now
</p>
<p>acknowledge to be just. Why? Because they dare not risk their position with the governing
</p>
<p>classes of England, by doing what w-as just towards Ireland, or even by avowing wdiat they
</p>
<p>thought, though they should halt in their realization of it.
</p>
<p>The inadequacy of the Municipal Reform grudgingly yielded to us the ungracious and
</p>
<p>graceless acknowledgment, that we ought to have some power of control over some portion
</p>
<p>of our affairs  the spirit in which that truth was confessed  the ill-conditioned disposition
</p>
<p>which reduced tlie control to the least possible limits, proved how baseless was the hope
</p>
<p>which still relied upon the completion of the demands then made for Ireland.
</p>
<p>xii PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The party which still stood forward to demand what was advised to be necessary for the
</p>
<p>country, became, after these events, still more limited in numbers ; but the enthusiasm of
</p>
<p>the people had utterly disappeared. If there were still a few who kept the foreground with
</p>
<p>him who never ceased to labour, they had abandoned all trust in their course of actiou 
</p>
<p>they had almost ceased to ask. And it was gravely and deliberately asserted in the Com-
</p>
<p>mons House of Parliament, that the absence of any agitation in Ireland, and the apparent
</p>
<p>acquiescence of the people in the then existing condition of things, was proof that there was
</p>
<p>no grievance of which they in reality could complain!
</p>
<p>It is the last drop that causes the cup to overflow ; and though little weight attached to
</p>
<p>the authority of the individual who made that strange assertion, yet the parliament continued
</p>
<p>to act as if tlie same impression was general amongst its members. From the valley of
</p>
<p>despair is plucked the flower hope; success comes from without the depths ; and the answer
</p>
<p>to the taunt of acquiescence is wrong, and its practical adoption by the legislature was the
</p>
<p>unfurling of the standard of Repeal.
</p>
<p>But apathy had sunk into the popular mind to such an extreme, that the standard of
</p>
<p>Repeal could not at once be hoisted unconditional!}' ; the people had been so long unused to
</p>
<p>the light of nationality, that they could not at once look upon its unveiled refulgence. They
</p>
<p>were like men who had long abstained, and to whom abundance would be death. It is
</p>
<p>certain, also, that many good men of all classes condemned tlie experiment which had trusted
</p>
<p>to the generosity of England, after so many fearful lessons, pointing out the contrary course
</p>
<p>as that which led to safety. The people thought with those, and they questioned the sin-
</p>
<p>cerity of the act which gave the standard of nationality to the breeze. The first efforts,
</p>
<p>consequently', of the cliief of the national party were necessarily directed to assure the
</p>
<p>people that Repeal meant perseverance as well as nationality. He required to convince
</p>
<p>them that it was intended to persist in what was riglit ; and that neither tlireat, or cajolery,
</p>
<p>neither solicitation or inducement, would ever cause tlie lowering of tliat flag.
</p>
<p>Meantime the period rapidly approached when the measure of Whig sliort comings had
</p>
<p>been filled, and tlieir own "finality" wrought " thej?a/t'" of their power. They had many
</p>
<p>sins towards us to answer for, unconfessed and " unanealed." But this was not enough to
</p>
<p>blind Irishmen to the more hideous crimes of their successors. The Irish people, therefore,
</p>
<p>threw themselves with great force into this final struggle, and to them is due the honour,
</p>
<p>by sacrifices of no small amount, and by struggles of tlie severest nature, of having pre-
</p>
<p>served the Whigs from total route.
</p>
<p>Advantage of this circumstance was taken by our ever vigilant opponents, and it was
</p>
<p>rung through all the changes, that the cry of Repeal meant nothing more than "bring back

</p>
<p>the Whigs," and the shout of nationality " put out the Tories." There is little doubt that this
</p>
<p>accusation had a depressing etfect upon the progress of tlie party identified with the vitality
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Long and urgent protestations, strenuous assertions of untiring devotedness to
</p>
<p>the principle of self-rule, and proofs of earnestness impossible to misconceive, were requisite
</p>
<p>before the people ceased to be incredulous. Tlie Loyal National Association gradually
</p>
<p>gathered within its circle the ardent, whether old or young, the zealous, the enthusiastic, the
</p>
<p>earnest and devoted, as well as the brilliant and the educated. But it did not equally succeed
</p>
<p>with the prudent and the wary ; and the people, from the causes we have enumerated, as
</p>
<p>well as others, were not manifesting any great zeal to add to it the only permanent elements
</p>
<p>of power  numbers and an "exchequer."
</p>
<p>On the second day of January, 1843, there was held in the Corn Exchange Rooms an
</p>
<p>ordinary meeting of the Association, at which Mr. O'Connell, with a prescience the most
</p>
<p>extraordinary which politician ever exhibited, proclaimed that to be " The Repeal Yeak."
</p>
<p>What explosions of laughter that caused all the wise  what ridicule was heaped upon
</p>
<p>all and each of the people who hardily a\'owed themselves Repealers  howtljc}' were scorned
</p>
<p>as the least unreasoning of men  the least intelligent of citizens  the most imbecile of
</p>
<p>thinkers! AVhat folly to use such language! Nay, there was not in it audacity sufficient
</p>
<p>to redeem it from puerility ! It was a slieer attempt to gull the peoiJle, and really it would
</p>
<p>very much surprise tlie gentlemen who sagaciously applied this gentle language to the an-
</p>
<p>nouncement of the Liberator of his countrymen, if all those who valued public opinion and
</p>
<p>their own character for common sense, did not very speedily recede from the Association.
</p>
<p>But they did not recede. And the instinctive good sense of the Irish people  that quality
</p>
<p>by which the heart corrects the head  made light of the wisdom of the wise.
</p>
<p>Meantime O'Connell was preparing for the fulfilment of his own prophecy.
</p>
<p> When the honourable and learned gentleman pronounced, during the progress of the Muni-
</p>
<p>cipal Reform Bill in parliament, that the new corporate bodies would become " Normal schools
</p>

</p>
<p>diously vindictive against Irish rights.
</p>
<p>But for any other end than that contemplated by Mr. O'Connell they would be valueless.
</p>
<p>In Ireland almost a second generation had sprung into manhood since the union. The young
</p>
<p>men iinow not self-rule save in theory. They had not had personal experience of its advan-
</p>
<p>tages. They knew not practically its operation for good, or the necessary corrections to be
</p>
<p>applied, that from its working evil should not spring. Here were institutions, the value of
</p>
<p>which might be felt by all  the working of wiiich would be known to all. Local institutions
</p>
<p>for the direction of local affairs, and the management of local funds for local purposes. The
</p>
<p>value of municipal institutions to Ireland was, that in them they had miniature legislatures ;
</p>
<p>men whom they had selected to speak their sentiments, and that in them they saw the
</p>
<p>reflex of their own opinions.
</p>
<p>It was necessary to prove that there was nothing impracticable in the working of the
</p>
<p>principle of representation, and that the Irish people, as had been sedulously inculcated, were
</p>
<p>not incapable of estimating its advantages, and of using them as men whom they became.
</p>
<p>It was desirable to establish, in fact, tliat wljich was so captivating in theory, that represen-
</p>
<p>tative institutions are calculated to augment the amount of human happiness and secure its
</p>
<p>permanence. The value of convincing a people by experience, that the privilege of legis-
</p>
<p>lating for themselves, and controlling tliose who manage their affairs, was worth a struggle,
</p>
<p>it was inappreciable. Thus the practical usefulness of agitation would be taught, and the
</p>
<p>necessity of persevering in it, until legislative as well as municipal institutions were secured
</p>
<p>to the people, would be indefeasibly established.
</p>
<p>Those were the natural and proper ends contemplated by the advocates of Municipal
</p>
<p>Reform for Ireland. The corporations were the proper schools for teaching the ways by
</p>
<p>which those ends might be accomplished. And, therefore, Mr. O'Connell was right in his
</p>
<p>anticipation tliat the corporations would become the best Noi'mal schools of agitation.
</p>
<p>The demonstration of the will of the Irish people for Repeal commenced in the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion of the metropolis of L-eland. The Assembly-house may be called the scene of the
</p>
<p>first "monster meeting." In March, 1843, the movement was begun which Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>would appear to have projected in t!ie preceding January.
</p>
<p>The ablest man of the Anglo-Irish party led the opposition upon that occasion. lie was
</p>
<p>sustained by others of great practical experience, and great abilities. It is not too much
</p>
<p>to say he failed. At this moment who can doubt he would himself admit the fact. But
</p>
<p>the triumpli of Repeal from tliat hour was unequalled. The first blow was struck  a
</p>
<p>sturdy blow and a winning blow. Its progress for months succeeding was one long and

</p>
<p>uninterrupted course of victory.
</p>
<p>The people became instantly assured that Repeal did not mean less than it pretended.
</p>
<p>They felt at once that those who led it had no view but to its final accomplishment  no
</p>
<p>contemplation but the realization of their plans.
</p>
<p>In this conjuncture it will be readily admitted that the Repeal press did good service.
</p>
<p>The projecting of the Nation a few months before this period was in itself " a great fact"
</p>
<p>in the agitation of the time. Nev7 men had just appeared at the Irish press. Young,
</p>
<p>enthusiastic, and able, they infused new vigour into those great conduits, from which
</p>
<p>the people imbibe intelligence and public spirit. They were men whose love of country was
</p>
<p>extreme, and whose power of commimicating their ardour to their countrymen was un-
</p>
<p>equalled. What they felt strongly they wrote vigorously. They were able to meet and to
</p>
<p>overcome opponents in elaborate argument or trencliant assault. They knew the capabilities
</p>
<p>as well as the history of their country, and knew the strength as well as the weakness of
</p>
<p>their countrymen. They possessed in an eminent degree perhaps a better knowledge  a
</p>
<p>knowledge of the strength and the weakness of their opponents. Possessing energy as well
</p>
<p>as ability, and sustaining power as well as strong enthusiasm, they were prepared at all
</p>
<p>times, and iu all modes, to promote or to defend their cause.
</p>
<p>New times demand new men, and it cannot detract from or diminish popular gratitude
</p>
<p>towards those who fought at the press the battle of religious freedom, to say the public exi-
</p>
<p>gencies demanded that they should be reinforced. A press more faithful, more zealous, less
</p>
<p>intolerant of opponents, or with more singleness of purpose, never was engaged in the service
</p>
<p>of any country.
</p>
<p>It is not too much to say that the Repeal press of Ireland did something for the sustain-
</p>
<p>ment of the national impulses.
</p>
<p>From the debate in the Corporation may be traced the unchecked triumph of the Repeal
</p>
<p>cause. Adhesions to the national ranks came pouring in from every side. IMoney flowed
</p>
<p>into the national exchequer. The people began distinctly to embody what they long had
</p>
<p>felt, that as Irishmen they had hopes and aspirations, as well as interests, not identified with
</p>
<p>those of Enffland.
</p>
<p>xiv PREFACE.
</p>
<p>Foreign nations also began to look with eagerness towards this western isle. Many spn-
</p>
<p>pathised openly with its people  many gave their good wishes who committed no such overt
</p>
<p>act. They had countenance and encouragement from France, counsel and support from
</p>
<p>America, good wishes for tlieir success from every land where Irish wrongs and the selfish-
</p>
<p>ness of tliose who inflicted tliem were known.
</p>
<p>But this was not the only indication given by foreigners of the extent to which tiiey re-
</p>
<p>garded the affairs of this country as operating upon the power of England, and regulatiufy
</p>
<p>their policy towards her. The Repealers of Ireland, and the sympathisers of America pro-
</p>
<p>duced the treaties of Wasliington and the abandonment of the Nortli-Western territor\-. The
</p>
<p>''monster meetings' produced tlie revolution, which drove the Duke of Victory igno-
</p>
<p>miniously from Spain.
</p>
<p>That must needs be a large stake wliich England plays for in this country when she can
</p>
<p>afford to abandon her influence, and acquiesce in the establishment of Frencli domination in
</p>
<p>the Peninsula, and to surrender in America a territory of great value in every point of view,
</p>
<p>that she may pursue her Irish game on the same terms that the gamester throws the loaded dice.
</p>
<p>But even gamesters lose at times though they play unfairly, and as Ireland never can
</p>
<p>lose all she must win at last.
</p>
<p>"While the Repealers held their monster demonstrations, and foreigners proclaimed the
</p>
<p>anxiety with which they looked towards this country, the ministry pursued the course of wea-
</p>
<p>rying by dehiy. Procrastination seemed their principle. They dreamed that Repeal would
</p>
<p>weary itself out ; that t!ie peojjie would tire of t'lc'r excitation in a pursuit, whicli, how-
</p>
<p>ever great in itself, was both remote in point of time and difficult of attainment. This
</p>
<p>cannot always last, they argued ; tlie people by-and-hy will abandon in loatliing that
</p>
<p>which they now urge with ardour unexampled. Peel likened it to Ciiartism, and the same
</p>
<p>prescription it was concluded would serve for tiie one whicli had succeeded with tlie other.
</p>
<p>Notliing is more dangerous either in medicine or politics, tlian endeavouring to adapt
</p>
<p>symptoms to a favourite tlieory without allowing for the difference of constitution, or of
</p>
<p>otiier causes. And certainly no two patients can be possibly more unlike than an Irishman
</p>
<p>and a veritable John Bull. Even tlie symptoms are not the same. Ciiartism is the antagonism
</p>
<p>of tlie system coincident with which England has become great. Repeal is a demand
</p>
<p>for the restoration of that order of public ufl^airs under which Ireland became prosperous
</p>
<p>and respected. England is an oligarchy, and that Ciiartism would destroj', to erect in
</p>
<p>its room their modification of tlic democratic principle. To this, the middle classes in
</p>
<p>England are opposed ; and though it would be rather bold to say that Chartism will never
</p>
<p>establish itself there, it never can do it without a revolution. That event may be jus-

</p>
<p>tifiable ; we doubt it ever can be bloodless. But the Irish are a patriarchal people ;
</p>
<p>they care little for a pure aristocracy, but they revere considerate and generous chiefs. In
</p>
<p>England, Chartism would destroy the wliole fabric of aristocracy  in Ireland, Repeal
</p>
<p>would only make that institution more firm. It would remodel and mitigate, but confiiin
</p>
<p>it for ever. Now, the Chartists, while they deny that physical force is a principle of their
</p>
<p>constitution, or a means which they approve, have never condemned the idea of arming,
</p>
<p>and never Iiavc repudiated the notion that they would not think the use of those arms, in cer-
</p>
<p>tain cases, advisable for the accomplishment of their purpose. With the Repealers it is not
</p>
<p>so. Tliey do not advocate tlie. propriety of arming, or the use of arms. On the contrarj-,'
</p>
<p>they repudiate all idea-of resorting to such means, under any iiossible circumstances, save
</p>
<p>that of direct and unprovoked attack. Sir Robert Peel, therefore, was wrong in applying
</p>
<p>to the one case that which had succeeded in the other. By this time he must feel him-
</p>
<p>self convinced that he has been in error.
</p>
<p>Yet the Right Hon. Bart, must have contemplated that the Irish Repealers would have
</p>
<p>been so ineffably foolish as to resort to an appeal to force; otherwise there is no meaning in
</p>
<p>the pouring of troops into the country, in fortifying barracks, loop-holing old walls, and pro-
</p>
<p>visioning lumble-down-houses promoted into fortresses.
</p>
<p>Perhaps tliere was a lime when these preparations would not have been inutile. But that
</p>
<p>has happily passed for over. Ardent in nature, prompt in the endeavour to realise what
</p>
<p>they project, there was a lime  and not a remote one either  when Irishmen would in all
</p>
<p>human likelihood have afforded an excuse for the application of that force with which the
</p>
<p>country abounded. They know better now. They are more instructed.  they are more
</p>
<p>contemplative  they are more sober. Intoxication woukl urge them to many bold deeds,
</p>
<p>but it would leave them incapable of self-protection. The Irish people now appear to be
</p>
<p>perfectly instructed in the truth that the long game is their game. It is the pace that kills,
</p>
<p>and those must go it who would ultimately reach the goal. At present the odds are
</p>
<p>certainly not in their favour; but it is their indomitable sobriety which sustains them.
</p>
<p>It is that which enables them clearly to anticipate the force of events, and to rely while
</p>
<p>they are prepared for them. A sober man has more wants than he who is not. He has
</p>
<p>PREFACE. XV .
</p>
<p>more capability of compreliending tlie means of supplying tliem. A sober man is an am-
</p>
<p>bitious mail. He will crave distinction among Ids fellows. He is the best patriot, because
</p>
<p>lie is liie most reasoning and reasonable. In short, the Apostle of Temperance, tliougli not
</p>
<p>of the society, is amongst the first rank of tlie Eepealers.
</p>
<p>Hence it is tliat the movement is so essentially a peaceful one. Ireland is a line of posts.
</p>
<p>The Dui<e of Wellington proclaimed long since in parliament tiiat lie had dene his part.
</p>
<p>We must conclude, therefore, tliat in a precautionary point of view no military tactician
</p>
<p>can do more. And wliat are all his preparations worth ? Do they make one Repealer less?
</p>
<p>Do they prevent any man from avowing his nationality ? Do they abstract one penny from
</p>
<p>the funds of the national exchequer ? The people do not liate the military, neither do
</p>
<p>they fear them. What is still more to the purpose, the military do not hate the people.
</p>
<p>The Repealers and the soldiery live everywhere upon the best possible terms llepealers have
</p>
<p>deprecated hostility by praise, and they liave succeeded, ibr soft words (uni away wrath.
</p>
<p>But they have not tampered with the military, and they have no need to do it, for tliey
</p>
<p>contemplated nothing in which military co-operation would be useful.
</p>
<p>As a measure of policy the military occupation of the country is utterly futile. Indeed
</p>
<p>it does not tend to produce any eifect save such as are calculated to damage and embarrass
</p>
<p>the interests of those who maintain the system. The energy with wliich the people keep
</p>
<p>the peace, and the vigour with which nof.\ithstanding they pursue their objects, cannot
</p>
<p>possibly excuse tlie use of the military arm of the Government.
</p>
<p>But this operation is perfectly consistent with the policy of tlie life of Sir Robert Peel ;
</p>
<p>.nhvays against the people, always with the oligarcliy  prepared, and apparently determined
</p>
<p>to uphold his principles, if need be, through blood, yet ever yielding what lie found that
</p>
<p>ciicumstanccs had made it dangerous to withhold. lie now proclaims, in accordance witii
</p>
<p>the sentiments of the Whig statesmen of England, that he is ready to maintain the union
</p>
<p>at all hazards, even at the risk of civil slaughter. He has made demonstrations of ids in-
</p>
<p>tentions  he lias prepared to perform his threat ; yet who is there now, upon a eonsidera-
</p>
<p>tion of the whole policy of his liie, will dare to say tliat Sir Robert Peel will not be the
</p>
<p>minister to recommend her ]\lajesty to acquiesce in the Repeal. He says lie will be no
</p>
<p>party to the dismemberment of the empire. How often lias he declared tliat the mainte-
</p>
<p>nance of the Constitution depended upon tlie perpetuation of Catholic disabilities ? How
</p>
<p>often has be protested that its integrity was inconsistent with the passing of the Reform
</p>
<p>Bill ? Yet lie advised and proposed the first, and proclaimed his readiness to govern iu the
</p>
<p>spirit of the other. He will not consent  he tells us  to the dismemberment of the em-
</p>
<p>pire. There are myriads of Repealers as conservative of that empire as the Premier. The

</p>
<p>Repealers do not desire its dismemberment. Far otherwise. They are solicitous to conso-
</p>
<p>lidate it. Wlio will venture to assert that Sir Robert Peel will not one day become con-
</p>
<p>vinced how much he lias wronged the Repealers, and maintain the empire by doing justice
</p>
<p>to the Irish peojile ?
</p>
<p>It has been urged that the Irish people owe the Premier much for his forbearance. AVe
</p>
<p>do not think so. He is too prudent to be violent. Ho would undermine opinion, not as-
</p>
<p>sault it. So far from tliis claim on Ids part having any weight, his policy has been marked
</p>
<p>by great insidiousness, and the occasion was only wanted, that it might prove sanguinary.
</p>
<p>The evidences which sustain this opinion are as numerous as the leaves. If the law has
</p>
<p>been broken  of this few people are yet convinced  then have the Government entrapped
</p>
<p>her Majesty's subjects iiito illegality. If the Repealers have acted in violation of the Con-
</p>
<p>stitution, then are the Government open to the charge of having allured to it. It is they
</p>
<p>who are the real conspirators.  it is they who are the avowed conspirators ; for, be the fact
</p>
<p>not forgotten, that, through the whole case made by the Solicitor-General, there runs this
</p>
<p>distinct avowal, that the Government permitted the Repealers to go on until they had time
</p>
<p>to develop what the learned gentleman contended was conspiracy, and until tlie Government
</p>
<p>had what they conceived suflicient evidence thereof.
</p>
<p>And what is this doctrine of conspiracy, which is now endeavoured to be established ?
</p>
<p>It has been admitted by all the counsel at the trial, with the exception of JMr. Fitzgibbon,
</p>
<p>whose views are more in accordance with ordinary conception, that it means the agreement
</p>
<p>to do an illegal act by legal means, or to do a legal act by illegal means.
</p>
<p>The traversers' alleged crime comes under the second category. It is legal to repeal the
</p>
<p>act of union, but the means by which it was intended to be accomplished are charged as
</p>
<p>.illegal. Now, what was the mode adopted to establish this charge ? First, a number of
</p>
<p>overt acts were offered to the jury, perfectly legal, perfectly harmless of themselves ; and,
</p>
<p>in order to make these evidence, the jury were called upon to imagine a conspiracy. And
</p>
<p>having kindly complied with the request, then they were called upon to make a further
</p>
<p>application of those same acts, tlius become illegal, and to receive thorn as prooft of the
</p>
<p>xvl PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>imagined conspiracy. "What was the proof offered that the overt acts, taken together, were
</p>
<p>illegal ? That the parties committing them were engaged in an illegal conspiracy. What
</p>
<p>were the evidences offered of the conspiracy ? That those acts had been committed !
</p>
<p>A more monstrous proceeding  a more absurd proof never vexed common sense,
</p>
<p>or was offered to a jury. If the verdict had in support of this doctrine  by means which
</p>
<p>have astonished the world  of civilization shall be finally established, there is an end to all
</p>
<p>public discussion ; it can exist no more save by the sufferance of the authorities. The ex-
</p>
<p>istence of such a state of things would be tjTanny. There is no one end proposed in
</p>
<p>which this monstrous prosecution has been successful. It has not put down Repeal. It
</p>
<p>has not re-established the feeling upon which alone the union could be permanently main-
</p>
<p>tained. It has not made any man less open in the utterance of his sentiments, or less eager
</p>
<p>to join himself to his fellow-countrymen for the realization of his objects. It has not made
</p>
<p>England more strong, but it has rendered her infinitely less respected. It has not subdued
</p>
<p>one particle of the spirit which animated the traversers, from the first and greatest, as well
</p>
<p>as the oldest of them, to the youngest of the eigiit. No man is now a firmer anti-repealer than
</p>
<p>before the prosecutions  thousands are much less so. Many, with Mr. Henn, would hesi-
</p>
<p>tate much more than before those trials to maintain the opinions which he holds; many men
</p>
<p>have been made by the proceedings converts to the truth of nationality.
</p>
<p>The conduct pursued towards this country has laid the basis of future embarrassments
</p>
<p>for England, and it has given Ireland reason to anticipate them joyously as the period of her
</p>
<p>liberation. As sure as England's empire has existence, so sure will she speedily feel the
</p>
<p>consequences of her treatment of this country. As sure as that hour arrives, so sure will
</p>
<p>this country obtain her legislative independence.
</p>
<p>There are many things which indicate great progress in the national mind. It is true
</p>
<p>that monster meetings are no longer held ; the obedience to authority, which is an essential
</p>
<p>characteristic of the Repealers, at once submitted to the proclamation. But the people are
</p>
<p>more firm than before, because every day brings them new proofs that Repeal is the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of redress, and new intelligence of the meaning and import, as well as of the
</p>
<p>consequences of nationality. Energy more sustained has never been manifested by a nation.
</p>
<p>Determination more strong has never been exhibited by a people. Peacefiilness and per-
</p>
<p>severance more complete have never added moral dignity to any movement. Sobriety and
</p>
<p>order are the parent of many virtues. They are now national characteristics of the Irish
</p>
<p>people. It is not to be contemplated that such a people shall not succeed. With leaders
</p>
<p>so prudent and so watchful, to fail were impossible.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell was therefore a prophet, when in 1843 he said that was the " Repeal

<p>year." It is that year which has placed us on the high ground. At whatever time Repeal
</p>
<p>shall come, that year deserves that name.
</p>
<p>Success would have justified the unprecedented proceedings by which the Irish govern-
</p>
<p>ment sought to beat down the Irish people; but they have not succeeded; they will not
</p>
<p>succeed. The convictions in which the shortsighted now triumph will- but serve to preci-
</p>
<p>pitate future dangers. When those dangers can be no more postponed  when they stare
</p>
<p>England in the face  then will the state trials be viewed in their trae light as a piece of
</p>
<p>tyrannous folly  then will Ireland have her own.
</p>
<p>There are many reasons why this edition of those trials is offered to the public. One or
</p>
<p>two it is only necessary to suggest. It was supposed, and the event has shown not without
</p>
<p>reason, that in "authorised" publications some tampering with the case might be anticipated.
</p>
<p>In the most elaborate of the works offered to the public and the profession, comprising the
</p>
<p>proceedings, the whole of that strange exhibition, in which the Attorney-General was the
</p>
<p>prominent actor, is omitted. " Authorised" publications of speeches are not more exempt
</p>
<p>from charges of that nature. This edition will, it is hoped, supply a corrective for these defi-
</p>
<p>ciencies, and, therefore, it will not be without its use even to those who may already have
</p>
<p>other versions. From the general body of tlie people its cheapness, and, it is hoped, its
</p>
<p>accuracy, will secure it favour. Three portions of tiie case for the Crown have been published
</p>
<p>by the Crown  the speeches of the law officers and the charge of the Chief Justice. The
</p>
<p>version here given of them will be found to differ from these only in such portions as had
</p>
<p>been made matters of comment during the proceedings, and where those versions had been
</p>
<p>so smoothed or emasculated as to vary from the spoken originals. It is hoped that the
</p>
<p>speeches of the Counsel for the Traversers will be found accurate. Every gentleman who
</p>
<p>spoke OH that side has had an opportunity of correcting his address ; and many of them
</p>
<p>have, with great kindness, and it must be at considerable inconvenience, made the necessary
</p>
<p>revisions.

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>1843-44.
</p>
<p>rEELlMINART OCCURRENCES.
</p>
<p>An enumeration of these n-oiikl be a liistory of the
</p>
<p>Repeal agitation from the moment of its unp.ar.alleled
</p>
<p>progress, after the discussion in the Coiiioration in
</p>
<p>March, 1843, until the ereninp in ivliich the Go-
</p>
<p>vernment issued the proclamation to suppress the
</p>
<p>Clontarf meeting. Tliose occurrences would here
</p>
<p>be out of place. They belong to the historian, and
</p>
<p>to his care we must commit them. It is necessary,
</p>
<p>however, for the purposes of this compilation, which
</p>
<p>pretends to nothing beyond the character of a faith-
</p>
<p>ful record of events, to advert only to such circum-
</p>
<p>st-ances as, preceding immediately the proclamation,
</p>
<p>and the prosecutions which necessarily resulted, are
</p>
<p>indispensable to the proper understanding of those
</p>
<p>proceedings.
</p>
<p>Upon the first day of October, 1843, was lield the
</p>
<p>monster meeting at Mullaghmast, and upon the
</p>
<p>previous day appeared in the Dublin journals,
</p>
<p>morning and weekly, an advertisement respecting
</p>
<p>the then intended meeting at Clontarf, which after-
</p>
<p>wards obtained no small degree of notoriety. It
</p>
<p>purported to proceed from authority. It was drawn
</p>
<p>with considerable pretension, and, technically apply-
</p>
<p>ing the phrases of military discipline, it w.as calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to eive to that meeting, which had been fixed
</p>
<p>for the 8th October, much of a military character.
</p>
<p>Tlie fact, however, was, that though the gentleman
</p>
<p>who drew up that advertisement was one of the
</p>
<p>secretaries to the Clontarf meeting, he did not con-
</p>
<p>sult on that paper either the committee of .arrange-
</p>
<p>ment or his brother-secretary. The docimieut
</p>
<p>caused much excitement, and was canvassed with
</p>

<p>upon it as a capital joke ; and in what conjuncture
</p>
<p>is it that an Irishman will not joke ? Tliose who
</p>
<p>were more prudent condemned the act, while they
</p>
<p>acknowledged the hannlessness of its intent. Those
</p>
<p>who were malicious protested that it was what they
</p>
<p>always thought, and that the designs of the re-
</p>
<p>pealers were beginning to be manifested in the full
</p>
<p>blow of revolutionary violence.
</p>
<p>The advertisement itself was immediately with-
</p>
<p>drawn. It was condemned by the Liberator. It
</p>
<p>was repudiated by the association in a deliberate
</p>
<p>vote. It was jeered in the press. Throughout the
</p>
<p>metropolis of Ireland a day or two saw the termi-
</p>
<p>nation of the interest it excited. In the English
</p>
<p>press, however, it was quoted and commented on,
</p>
<p>and the English people, with their accustomed cre-
</p>
<p>dulity, at once appear to have felt quite persuaded
</p>
<p>that it was but the first of a series of manifestoes,
</p>
<p>which were to have preceded a general rising. In
</p>
<p>the mean time, the author, in a letter under bis
</p>
<p>hand, generously and manfully avowed it, and pro-
</p>
<p>claimed his readiness to assume all the responsibility
</p>
<p>which might in any way attach to his production.
</p>
<p>The period fixed for the meeting was fast ap-
</p>
<p>proaching. Rumours became rife  weak and faint
</p>
<p>at first, then confident and strong, and then assured.
</p>
<p>It was asserted that repeal would be put down, and
</p>
<p>repealers also  that the military would occupy the
</p>
<p>Corn-Exchange, and that those who again attended
</p>
<p>monster m'eetings must do so at the peril of their
</p>
<p>lives. It seemed to be the persuasion of every man
</p>
<p>that the meeting at Clontarf would not be sufferetl
</p>
<p>to assemble, unless at the expense of blood and
</p>
<p>slaughter. In the Evening Mail of the 6th October,

</p>
<p>in brief terms, the preliminary occurrences to those
</p>
<p>prosecutions, whicli have attracted the attention of
</p>
<p>the world.
</p>
<p>In brief, then, the proclamation was issued, pro-
</p>
<p>hibiting the meeting at Clontarf. The Repeal
</p>
<p>Association issued their counter proclamation,
</p>
<p>signei by the Irish Liberator, which prevented the
</p>
<p>assemblage there. The utmost carelessness was
</p>
<p>shown in the circulation of the former document 
</p>
<p>exertion almost incredible was used in the distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of the latter. If it was desired that the troops
</p>
<p>of her Majesty should be brought into collision
</p>
<p>with her Majesty's Jrish subjects, then there could
</p>
<p>not possibly have been taken steps more positively
</p>
<p>calculated to produce that collision.* The duty of
</p>
<p>preserving tlie peace and protecting the lives of
</p>
<p>thousamls, while it also prevented a tearful revolu-
</p>
<p>tion, was left to the Repeal Association. That
</p>
<p>association did its duty ; the peace was kept; the
</p>
<p>lieges were protected, and the liberties of Ireland
</p>
<p>were secured
</p>
<p>But the proclamation having been issued, it was
</p>
<p>impossible the Government could stop there. Pro-
</p>
<p>secutions were, therefore, anticipated, and the pre-
</p>
<p>piration made by those who e.ipected to be the
</p>
<p>objects at which they must be aimed, was to be
</p>
<p>still more firm in conduct, bold in action, and de-
</p>
<p>cided in declaration. Tne Corn-Exchange could
</p>
<p>not possibly contain one-fiftietli of those who, it was
</p>
<p>known, would attend at the ordinary meeting of the
</p>
<p>Repeal Association on the day subsequent to the

<p>and could not.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Peter James Tyrrell, P.P. of Lusk, was
</p>
<p>at tlie theatre, and proposed for its adoption a
</p>
<p>series of resolutions intended to have been offered
</p>
<p>to the consideration of tlie people at Clontarf, had
</p>
<p>that meeting been permitted to assemble. It was
</p>
<p>for that act he was marked out for the prosecution
</p>
<p>to which he fell a martyr; for in that prosecution
</p>
<p>he met martyrdom, prom the moment in which
</p>
<p>he reeeive.l the proclamation, until the last of his
</p>
<p>existence, he never spent a quiet hour. Anxiety
</p>
<p>placed him upon tenter hooks, because he, a man of
</p>
<p>peace, and of great nervousness, dreaded the extre-
</p>
<p>mities to which the country might be driven, and
</p>
<p>to which he, with many others, believed it was in-
</p>
<p>tended to be forced. He fellbejieath the indictment.
</p>
<p>His death-bed was disturbed by it. Fortunately,
</p>
<p>its influence ceased there  the eternal peace of
</p>
<p>a man so excellent and so belove.1, we may believe,
</p>
<p>in one moment repaid liim for the torments of this
</p>
<p>transitory existence.

<p>The week succeeding that which saw the procla-
</p>
<p>mation issued, waspne of extreme interest in Dub-
</p>
<p>lin. Regiments were arriving every day. Artillery
</p>
<p>were landed upon our quays. Ammunition was
</p>
<p>poured into every barrack. We were threatened
</p>
<p>with the force of one corps into which " no Catholic"
</p>
<p>was admitted, and with the vigour of another
</p>
<p>amongst whom " no Irish" were enrolled. The
</p>
<p>accusations, too, against the leaders were made to
</p>
<p> The difficulty of effecting this may be estimated by the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing incident: Among the gentlemen who were appointed
</p>
<p>to stop the approach of tlie myriads who were moving on Clon-
</p>
<p>tarf on the morning of the meeti.g, was a gentleman who very

</p>
<p>that headed " De Grey" irould have had but very
</p>
<p>little effect, was issued from the association on the
</p>
<p>publication of that prohibiting the meeting at
</p>
<p>Clontarf. As soon as Mr. O'Cojinell was made
</p>
<p>acquainted with the charge against him, on the 14th
</p>
<p>October, he issued a notification to the Irish people,
</p>
<p>which was published the same day in the repeal
</p>
<p>journals, and by that means transmitted throughout
</p>
<p>the kingdom. It contained the most earnest solici-
</p>
<p>tations to the people to " violate no law," not " to
</p>
<p>be guilty of any tumult or disturbance," not " to
</p>
<p>be tempted to break the peace, but to act peaceably,
</p>
<p>quietly, and legally," and then that the " attempt
</p>
<p>upon their liberties must fail."
</p>
<p>Upon the same day was also prc-published an
</p>
<p>address, wliich was on the following Monday agreed
</p>
<p>to by the association, calling upon the people, by
</p>
<p>every obligation which they could acknowledge, to
</p>
<p>preserve the peace, and to obey the law, and thus
</p>
<p>at once to furnish irrefutable evidence that they
</p>
<p>were fitted for self-government by the perfection
</p>
<p>with which they should practice self-control.
</p>
<p>THE INFORMATIONS.
</p>
<p>THE PARTIES LAYING THEM.
</p>
<p>The informations were, of course, soon made
</p>
<p>public, and it then appeared that they had been
</p>
<p>sworn by Mr. Bond Hughes, who had attended at
</p>
<p>the meeting at MuUaghmast, at the theatre, Abbey-
</p>
<p>street, and at a meeting of the association. Mr.
</p>
<p>Hughes verified the facts ; Mr. Kemmis, the crown
</p>
<p>solicitor, swore to the inuendoes, some of which he
</p>
<p>must have found, we should think, rather hard to
</p>
<p>swallow.
</p>
<p>Immediately upon the publication of the informa-
</p>
<p>tions it was discovered that they were erroneous as

</p>
<p>to known facts, and it was, therefore, determined
</p>
<p>to have their accuracy challenged, and the infor-
</p>
<p>mant punished.
</p>
<p>The misstated facts were these : It was charged
</p>
<p>by Mr. Hughes that Mr. Barrett, proprietor of the
</p>
<p>Pilot, had been present, and had spoken at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing in Abbey-street theatre, on the 8th October,
</p>
<p>and that he had also been present and had spoken
</p>
<p>at the dinner in the Rotunda, on the evening of the
</p>
<p>same day. Both assertions were untrue. Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett was not in the neighbourhood of the theatre at
</p>
<p>all on that day, and long before the hour of dinner
</p>
<p>in the evening, he had returned from Dublin to his
</p>
<p>country residence.
</p>
<p>Informations were, therefore, advised to be jire-
</p>
<p>ferred against Mr. Hughes, for " wilful and corrupt
</p>
<p>perjury" in having sworn to those facts.
</p>
<p>Tills may seem at first view a harsh proceeding,
</p>
<p>but it should be remembered that at that time there
</p>
<p>was no knowledge in the possession of the gentleman
</p>
<p>named in his informations, of the lengths to which
</p>
<p>he might be inclined to go in sustaming the charges
</p>
<p>to be subsequently made, and it was therefore con-
</p>
<p>sidered, as a providential circumstance, that he
</p>
<p>should have thus tripped at the very outset. As a
</p>
<p>stranger, it was quite possible he might have been
</p>
<p>mistaken, but he had had given him an opportunity
</p>
<p>of correcting the error he had committed, and there-
</p>
<p>fore not havuig done that, it was not uncharitably
</p>
<p>concluded that the mistakes were deliberate and did
</p>
<p>really amount to perjury. For Mr. Hughes was pre-
</p>
<p>sent in the judge's parlour when the accused gentle-
</p>
<p>men were entering into bail, and he then had a full
</p>
<p>opportunity of recognizing 5Ir. Barrett. His sub-

</p>
<p>waved their handkerchiefs, and exliibited every tolien
</p>
<p>of respect and attachment to tlie lAberator and his
</p>
<p>son. On arriving at the courts, where several
</p>
<p>thousand persons had assembled, both father and
</p>
<p>son were greeted with a warmth and cordiality such
</p>
<p>as even they wore seldom accustomed to receive,
</p>
<p>and on their entry into the hall another joyous wel-
</p>
<p>come awaited them. After walking about the hall
</p>
<p>for some minutes they retired to an ante-chamber,
</p>
<p>where they remained until the court rose. This
</p>
<p>measure was taken, in order that the learned gentle-
</p>
<p>men might attend in court, should their appearance
</p>
<p>be required there. On leaving, the same popular
</p>
<p>and generous feeling was raauifested towards them.

<p>after the arrival of his lordship. Messrs. Ford,

<p>Cantwell, Mahony, and Gartland, the agents of the

</p>
<p>'iiiateiual to state to you. It appears, tlien, tliat some
</p>
<p>or one of the persons charged, have, or has asserted,
</p>
<p>at some or oue of the certain public meetings re-
</p>
<p>ferred to in the informations, that this legislative
</p>
<p>union is in itself unlawful, and that it is absolutely
</p>
<p>void, the consequence of which might be that every
</p>
<p>statute made since the union, and importing to bind
</p>
<p>Ireland, would to that extent be void, and of no legal
</p>
<p>effect. Gentlemen, whether this imputed language
</p>
<p>be correctly stated, or whether any language to that
</p>
<p>effect was actually used, and if used, was used in
</p>
<p>that sense, is for you, as far as may be necessary,
</p>
<p>to examine and satisfy yom'selves of. But I think
</p>
<p>.the statement in the sworn informations, as I have
</p>
<p>collected it, authorises and makes it incumbent on
</p>
<p>me to say to you in tliis place, that such a propo-
</p>
<p>sition has no legal foundation, and that the legisla-
</p>
<p>tive union is not only practically, but lawfully, in
</p>
<p>force in Ireland; and that you, in exercising j'our
</p>
<p>judgment upon the indictment that will be presented
</p>
<p>to you, are bound so to consider it. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>this certainly is not to be supposed to amount to a
</p>
<p>denial of tlie right of the subjects of this country, or
</p>
<p>any portion of them, to contest the political expe-
</p>
<p>diency of continuing that legislative union in its
</p>
<p>present state, or of seeking by lawful means an
</p>
<p>alteration of it; and, accordingly, the charge in the
</p>
<p>iudictment applicable to this o^uestion is, or will be,
</p>
<p>this, or to tlus effect  namely, that the persons
</p>
<p>charged conspired unlawfully and seditiously to ex-
</p>
<p>cite disaffection and discontent amongst the Queen's
</p>
<p>subjects, and to excite them to hatred and contempt
</p>
<p>of the government and constitution, as bj' law estab-
</p>
<p>lished, and to unlawful opposition and resistance

<p>the constitution and government, as now established,
</p>
<p>that, in your consideration of this part of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, you are to direct your attention ; and you will
</p>
<p>so direct 3'our attention to it, not merely with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to that particular count, but also as it may
</p>
<p>give any light to you on your examination of all or
</p>
<p>any other of the counts in the indictment. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I will now proceed in adthtion and with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the observations I have just concluded, to
</p>
<p>call your attention to one of tlie charges in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, which appears to me to be of paramount
</p>
<p>importance, and tlxat is the one which charges,' as
</p>
<p>part of the alleged conspiring, the inducing and pro-
</p>
<p>curing large numbers of persons to assemble and
</p>
<p>meet together, in order, by intimidation, and the
</p>
<p>demonstration of physical force, to procure changes
</p>
<p>to be made in the constitution of the realm, as by
</p>
<p>law established. Gentlemen, with respect to this
</p>
<p>charge, it is to be observed, so far as I can collect
</p>
<p>from the informations that have been before me,
</p>
<p>and upon which the bill must, at least, be in part
</p>
<p>grounded, that the intimidation spoken of does not
</p>
<p>necessarily impute to the persons calling together
</p>
<p>those multitudes.  who appear to have assembled at
</p>
<p>different times, and to have been occasionally ad-
</p>
<p>dressed, as it appears by the informations, by the
</p>
<p>appellation of lighting men  it does not, I mean to
</p>
<p>say, express any design or intention of promoting or
</p>
<p>encouraging any infraction of tlie public peace on
</p>
<p>those occasions. On the contrary, it would appear
</p>
<p>to me that a principal object, and one very earnestly
</p>
<p>pressed upon those multitudes, was the strictly ab-
</p>
<p>staining at those times to hazard any breach of the
</p>
<p>peace. The charge, as I understand it, is this
</p>
<p>THE miSH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>a misdemeanour, and I cannot but feel myself bound
</p>
<p>to say that in my own present views of tliis part of
</p>
<p>the case, tlie fact of itself opens considerations of
</p>
<p>Very great importance, and such as would, in my
</p>
<p>judgment, under the admitted or hitherto uncon-
</p>
<p>tested circumstances of it, disclose a case very tit
</p>
<p>for, and which possibly could only he satisfactorily
</p>
<p>adjudicated on by, a trial under the plea of not
</p>
<p>guilty to the indictment. Gentlemen, there is
</p>
<p>Ruother charge of a specific offence to which I think
</p>
<p>it right to call your notice. It is iu itself a cliarge
</p>
<p>which deserves attention and consideration, and it is
</p>
<p>not without an application to the other charges in
</p>
<p>the indictment, so far, at least, as respects the
</p>
<p>motives and possible consequences of tliose proceed-
</p>
<p>ings which are the immediate subject of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. Gentlemen, I here allude to the charge of
</p>
<p>endeavouring to bring into contempt and disrepute
</p>
<p>the legal tribunals of the countrj', to diminish tlie
</p>
<p>confidence of the Queen's subjects in the same, and to
</p>
<p>assume and usurp the prerogatives of the crown in
</p>
<p>the estahlishmeut of courts for the administration
</p>
<p>of the law. Upon this, gentlemen, I shall only say
</p>
<p>that the offence as here charged, is a misdemeanour,
</p>
<p>and that there is evidence partly, but not altogether
</p>
<p>of an inferential character in support of that charge,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as the evidence in some parts of it goes to
</p>
<p>the actual appointing of persons to fill the ofiice of
</p>
<p>administering justice in public courts, designated for
</p>
<p>that purpose, and accompanied by a declaration, if
</p>
<p>the evidence be true, that judges shall in future be
</p>
<p>appointed by the people. Gentlemen, such a measure
</p>
<p>  I mean the appointment of public arbitrators to de-
</p>
<p>cide on matters in litigation or dispute between the
</p>
<p>Queen's subjects (if that should be considered a

<p>beneficial measure for the public)  should properly
</p>
<p>be effected by an act of parliament, so that the mea-
</p>
<p>sure appearing to have been adopted for the eflectua-
</p>
<p>tion of it may seem to have been so adopted, upon
</p>
<p>the assumption that the parliameut of the United
</p>
<p>Kingdom is not a lawful parliament, and that, there-
</p>
<p>fore, the inhabitants of Ireland are justified in
</p>
<p>actiug in opposition to, or in contempt of its author-
</p>
<p>ity. The fact of such an assumption is, however,
</p>
<p>in this particular, wholly inferential, and it is there-
</p>
<p>fore for you, under all the circumstances, to deter-
</p>
<p>mine upon this as well as the other charges. I
</p>
<p>cauuot, however, but observe further, that in cases
</p>
<p>of such a description, in which the character of the
</p>
<p>act or acts on which the indictment is grounded,
</p>
<p>depends on the question of a supposed guilty design,
</p>

</p>
<p>turning on grounds or reasons of law, applicable,
</p>
<p>perhaps, to hypothetical cases  it m\ist, or, perhaps
</p>
<p>may, be matter of much difiiculty for a grand jury,
</p>
<p>in the exercise of its functions, to come to a deter-
</p>
<p>mination upon them ; and tliat, therefore, if the
</p>
<p>facts on which the evidence is charged are clearly
</p>
<p>proved, it may be the better course to find the bill
</p>
<p>on that evidence, leaving them, together with their
</p>
<p>legal consequences, to a trial, on an issue joined on
</p>
<p>a plea of not guilty. Gentlemen, I hope that, so far
</p>
<p>I have succeeded in making myself intelligible to
</p>
<p>you as to the course of your duty, and as to the con-
</p>
<p>Bcquences attendant upon the exercise of that duty.
</p>
<p>By the exercise of your duty I mean the finding or
</p>
<p>the non-finding, as to you must appear most fit and
</p>
<p>proper, of a true bill ; which, if found, will send the
</p>
<p>case to be decided upon by a jury chosen to decide

</p>
<p>Mr. Hatcliell, Q.C., said that tlie parties bound in
</p>
<p>recognizance to attend the court were now in atten -
</p>
<p>dance, and were perfectly ready to abide by any
</p>
<p>order that might be made relative to thera.
</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Hatchell made this obsei-vation,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster conferred with tlie Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>who immediatelj' rose and said (with much apparent
</p>
<p>acerbity)  Oh, Mr. Hatchell, as to that, the terms
</p>
<p>of their recognizance are, that they are to attend
</p>
<p>the court not only on the first day of term, but from
</p>
<p>day to day, pending the pleasure of the court.
</p>
<p>Air. Justice Burton  That is, of course, under-
</p>
<p>stood.
</p>
<p>The jury then retired to their jury-i-oom.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice (Peunefather), with Mr. Justices
</p>
<p>Perrin and Crampton, entered the court at half-past
</p>
<p>two o'clock, and took their seats with Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Burton.
</p>
<p>Having already explained the nature of the charge
</p>
<p>made by Mr. Barrett against Mr. Bond Huglies,
</p>
<p>we should not feel it necessary to advert to the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings against the latter had in court tliis term,
</p>
<p>but that they disclose a portion of the practice
</p>
<p>adopted in these Crown Prosecutions, by tlie officers
</p>
<p>of the court, and by a majority of tlie judges, vary-
</p>
<p>ing, as the accused alleged, trom the ordinary course
</p>
<p>adopted by them in otlier cases, and evincing on the
</p>
<p>part of the officers a feeling in the matter highly
</p>
<p>reprehensible, unwarrantable, and unjust. As evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the truth of tliis allegation, they arc indis-
</p>
<p>pensable to a true history of the cause.

<p>Mr. Barrett, for an order in the nature of mandamus.
</p>
<p>[Counsel heie stated the circumstances which
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett conceived to be his justification for the
</p>
<p>charge preferred by him against Mr. Bond Hughes,
</p>
<p>and continued:] It was the right of JMr Barrett to
</p>
<p>bring the ease before the court, as he was entitled to
</p>
<p>a quasi mandamus directed to the magistrates, in
</p>
<p>order to make them receive tlie informations in the
</p>
<p>case, and for that purpose there were the affidavits
</p>
<p>of thirteen persons brought by Mr. Cantwell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett's attorney, to the officer of that court
</p>
<p>(Mr. Bourne), and tendered by him to be sworn ; but
</p>
<p>herefu: ed to receive them, alleging that tliey werenot
</p>
<p>affidavits, but informations for an ulterior object. The
</p>
<p>officer 01 that court had no right to turn round, and
</p>
<p>say, when affidavits were tendered to him, that he
</p>
<p>could not receive them, because they amounted to
</p>
<p>informations. The officer had no right to e-xamine
</p>
<p>vi\\\ such an object the documents, and tlien refuse
</p>
<p>to have the parties sworn to them; and his (Mr.
</p>
<p>M'Uonogh's) application to the court was, tliat an
</p>
<p>order be made to the officer compelling him to re-
</p>
<p>ceive the affidavits tendered to him in the case.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Have you served notice of this ap-
</p>
<p>plication on the Attorney-General ?
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  We have had no notice what-
</p>
<p>ever of this, it comes on us quite by surprise.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne said he refused to receive the docu-
</p>
<p>ments or swear the parties to them, because the
</p>
<p>documents were not affidavits but informations
</p>
<p>against a party.
</p>
<p>Cliief Justice  Mr. M'Douogh, you must serve
</p>
<p>notice of this motion on the crown.

</p>
<p>It was then arranged that the affidavits should be
</p>
<p>Bworn at the sitting of the court in the morning.
</p>
<p>The court then adjourned to ten o'clock the
</p>
<p>following morning.

<p>The Queen at the prosecution of Richard Bairett V.
</p>
<p>Frederick Bond Hughes.
</p>
<p>In this case several persons, amongst whom were
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell, M.P.; Mr. Barrett, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Eev. Mr. Tj'rrell, Mr. Eay, Mrs. Barrett, Dr. Gray,
</p>
<p>&c., swore affidavits in open court, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of sustaining the charge of perjury brought against
</p>
<p>the defendant.
</p>
<p>During the period which elapsed between the
</p>
<p>swearing of the grand jury and the finding of the
</p>
<p>bills, the reports prevalent, which even got currency
</p>
<p>through the press, were exceedingly unpleasant.
</p>
<p>Members betraying brothers of the association 
</p>
<p>committee-men abstracting papers  plots the most
</p>
<p>extravagant were confidently rumoured to have
</p>
<p>been discovered, and every repealer was looked
</p>
<p>upon by the anti-nationalists as a baffled tamperer
</p>
<p>with treason. This was said to have been the basis
</p>
<p>of the fresh bills of which Mr. Attorney-General
</p>
<p>held out the threat. The I'epealers laughed heartilj',
</p>
<p>however, at the idea of traitorism amongst their
</p>
<p>body, where they knew there was nothing to dis-
</p>
<p>close, and a few days sufficed to suppress these
</p>
<p>rumours, because those who promidgated them
</p>
<p>perceived that they were utterly bootless. There
</p>
<p>were, it is true, persons who were members of the
</p>
<p>association in communication with the government,
</p>
<p>but there never was a public body so long banded,
</p>
<p>and having so many members, in which the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings were so entirely free from illegality, and

<p>the conduct of the members so little exposed to
</p>
<p>designing accusations.
</p>
<p>Much strength no doubt  mucli vitality, perhaps
</p>
<p>all which they possessed, were given those rumours
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>Upon the 6th November, the fourth day of term,
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh moved the coiirt in an able argu-
</p>
<p>ment, that it should issue a mandamus to the magis-
</p>
<p>trates of College-street police office, directing tliem
</p>
<p>to take informations in the case of Richard Barrett
</p>
<p>v. Frederick Bond Hughes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Attorney-General opposed the application,
</p>
<p>and in the course of his argument, in which he re-
</p>
<p>presented the application us one intended to pre-
</p>
<p>judice the case, at that time still before the grand
</p>
<p>jury, he used the following very remarkable lan-
</p>
<p>guage :  If the present hill before the grand jury was
</p>
<p>found, he would undertake to establish as wicked
</p>
<p>and foul a conspiracy as ever disturbed an empire !
</p>
<p>This very strong declaration was the subject of
</p>
<p>much comment at the time, both in society and
</p>
<p>at the press, and a declaration of such a uatiire,
</p>
<p>while it was protested against as likely to prejudice
</p>
<p>the grand jury, yet shocked and alarmed many
</p>
<p>timid men, while it thus gave an advantage of the
</p>
<p>most extended nature to the alarmist and the
</p>
<p>designing.
</p>
<p>The Court refused Mr. M'Donogh's application
</p>
<p>for a maudamus, but permitted him to send, if he
</p>
<p>desired, bills of indictment against Mr. Hughes,
</p>
<p>before the grand jury,' restraining him, however,
</p>
<p>from proceeding in that way until after the bills
</p>
<p>for conspiracy then before them should have been
</p>
<p>disposed of.
</p>
<p>THE BILLS THE INDICTMElfT.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cantwell (agent for Mr. Tyrrell) I Imve
</p>
<p>obtained the license.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Then produce it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cantwell  I have the license, but it is not in
</p>
<p>court, but I pledge myself that I have it, and I am
</p>
<p>mucli surprised that the Attorney-General should
</p>
<p>make that statement.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh I did not accept the retainers
</p>
<p>until I was told the licenses were taken out.
</p>
<p>Mr. Close said he was also counsel for Jlr.
</p>
<p>Tyrrell, and was proceeding to address the courts
</p>
<p>but . .
</p>
<p>Mr. Cantwell said My client, my lord, calls upon
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh in this court, and claims to have
</p>
<p>his assistance in this court, having obtained the
</p>
<p>Queen's letters of license. I now call upon Mr.
</p>
<p>M'Donogh to act for liim. It is monstrous to make
</p>
<p>such an objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh said there was no doubt about
</p>
<p>the license having been obtained. He had a know-
</p>
<p>ledge oftheliceusesintheseveral other cases, butnot
</p>
<p>-in tliis particular case ; but he was sure the gentle-
</p>
<p>tlemen would be satisfied with the word of the
</p>
<p>attorney.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said tliat as Mr. Cantwell stated
</p>
<p>the license was obtained, they were satisfied.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh then called upon the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General to produce an authority, authorising the
</p>
<p>course of proceeding he proposed to take.
</p>
<p>Tlie Attorney-General contended that counsel
</p>
<p>for a party could not be heard before the indict-
</p>
<p>ment was found, and submitted that Mr. M'Donogh,
</p>
<p>or any otlier counsel, had no right to be heard on
</p>
<p>the part of Mr. Tyrrell, at this stage of the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings.

</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh said the Attorney-General had
</p>
<p>" stated that he ought not be heard, but the court
</p>
<p>would recollect that it had called upon him.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I dare say the irregularity is attri-
</p>
<p>butable to me.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster But if Mr. M'Donogh goes on
</p>
<p>further, the irregularity will be his from this
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p>The Cliief Justice said the court were of opinion
</p>
<p>that in this state of the proceedings this could not
</p>
<p>be properly called a bill of indictment; it was no
</p>
<p>sucli thing until tlic judgment of the grand jury
</p>
<p>was passed on it, and until then it was merely a
</p>
<p>proceeding sent up to the grand jury, on tlie part
</p>
<p>of the crown, by the Attorney-General, through
</p>
<p>the hands of the Clerk of the Crown. At present
</p>
<p>there was no third person that had a right to be
</p>
<p>heard in it at all, and if the grand jury pointed out
</p>
<p>a clerical error to the court, and if the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General were desirous to have the mistake rectified,
</p>
<p>the court will give him full permission to do it, or
</p>
<p>he might do so without asking the com't at all.
</p>
<p>Tiie Clerk of the Crown then erased the word
</p>
<p>" Tierney" in the fourth count, where it was in-
</p>
<p>serted instead of "Tyrrell," and the word "Tyrrell"
</p>
<p>was substituted for it.
</p>
<p>Tlie Attorney-General then applied to have the
</p>
<p>word " affirmation ' introduced into the opening of the
</p>
<p>counts. Since the jury was sworn they found that one
</p>
<p>Of them belonged to the Society of Friends, and that
</p>
<p>rendered the alteration necessary. The indictment
</p>
<p>eonnneuoed  " And the jurors of our lady the
</p>
<p>Queen, on their oaths, present," &c. ; whereas it
</p>
<p>should be  " And the jurors of our lady the Queen,

<p>of hook-all allegation, that Mr. O'Connell, John

<p>O'ConneU, Thomas Steele, T. M. Ray, Charles G.

<p>Duffy, Thomas Tlerney, I'eter James Tyrrell, John

<p>1843, and on divers other days and times before and
</p>
<p>after that day, and at divers other places in divers
</p>
<p>other parts of Ireland," seek to carry on the alleged
</p>
<p>conspiracy by meeting, collecting money, making
</p>
<p>se<litious speeches, and adopting resolutions.
</p>
<p>In the foregoing summary we have enumerated

<p>the several alleged overt acts upon which the first

<p>Clerk of the Crown  Charles Gavan Duffy, Esq.
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy Here.
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele  My lords, I take this opportunity of
</p>
<p>stating that I am under your lordships' peculiar
</p>
<p>protection, as it is my intention to defend myself
</p>
<p>without counsel, as I have done before, and suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully, on a former similar occasion.
</p>
<p>[Here there was a strong sensation, and some
</p>
<p>noise in the court, owing to the entrance of the
</p>
<p>Liberator and Mr. John O'Connell.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne  John Graj'.
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele  I beg pardon, sir ; I have occasion to
</p>
<p>address the court. My lords, I also think it right
</p>
<p>t ) inform j'ou  speaking for myself alone, and leav-
</p>
<p>ing my friends, the other traversers, to act for them-
</p>
<p>S3lves according to their own discretion  that I
</p>
<p>decisively object to be prosecuted by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General (great laughter throughout the court). It
</p>
<p>is no laughing matter ; it is a matter of the admi-
</p>
<p>nistration of the public justice of the country I
</p>
<p>(The laughter instantly subsided into dead silence.)
</p>
<p>I say, my lords, that I decisively object to my being
</p>
<p>prosecuted by the Attornej'-General, as it is matter
</p>
<p>of notoriety through the press, that he has publicly
</p>
<p>prejudged the question, and has prejudged it too in
</p>
<p>terms of great malignity to the accused, while their
</p>
<p>case was actually under the consideration of a jury.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I hope the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General will have the sense of propriety, or indeed,
</p>
<p>my lords, I ought rather say, the sense of common
</p>
<p>decency to withdraw himself on this occasion from

<p>the function of public prosecutor for the crown, and
</p>
<p>leave that duty to be performed by his highly gifted,
</p>
<p>and patient, and good-tempered colleague, the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown  Thomas Matthew Ray, Esq.
</p>
<p>Mr. Kay  Here.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then called the Rev.
</p>
<p>Peter James Tyrrell, who also appeared. The Libe-
</p>
<p>rator and Mr. J. O'Connell took their seats in
</p>
<p>the front of the side bar, near their counsel. Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray and Mr. Barrett also appeared.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown (to the Attorney-General) 
</p>
<p>They have all answered.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Now, my lords, I have to move
</p>
<p>your lordships that your lordships do order that the
</p>
<p>defendants do plead in four days, to be computed
</p>
<p>from the present time. I move, mider the statute
</p>
<p>60th George IIL, in wliich there is an express pro-
</p>
<p>vision to that effect, and I move, on the precedent
</p>
<p>of a similar order, made in the case of the ICing v.
</p>
<p>O'Connell in the year 183 1. I now ask for the same
</p>
<p>order that was made on that occasion  on the 26th
</p>
<p>of January, 1831.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  What is the condition of the recog-
</p>
<p>nizances entered into by the traversers ?
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  The recognizance Is, my lord,
</p>
<p>to appear personally. I have a copy of the recog-
</p>
<p>nizance before me, and they are bound to appear in
</p>
<p>person, and, pursuant to the terras of it, they have
</p>
<p>appeared in person. The officer of the court has
</p>
<p>taken down their appearance, and, in pursuance of
</p>
<p>that statute, I now move that they plead in four
</p>
<p>days. That statute makes express provision for
</p>
<p>the purpose, and provides that where any person is
</p>
<p>THE INDICTMENT,
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>being read. He misjlit now insist upon its being
</p>
<p>read. It is to save the public time that the copy is
</p>
<p>directed to be given, and until that copy is given,
</p>
<p>which is a substitute for the reading of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, the party ought not to be called upon to saj'
</p>
<p>what he has to offer in answer to the indictment.
</p>
<p>He should not be called upon to answer until he
</p>
<p>sees the copy, not having haard it read in court.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  -He lias four days to consider the
</p>
<p>course he shall take. If that be enough for his pur-
</p>
<p>pose what is the necessity for stipulating before-
</p>
<p>hand that he shall have further time given to him.
</p>
<p>Mr. ritzgilibou  That four days, .according to
</p>
<p>the old practice, was reckoned from the time the
</p>
<p>indictment was completely read to him. That is
</p>
<p>not done, but it is said that a copy will be furnished
</p>
<p>in the course of the night. The accused might be
</p>
<p>called upon to plead when he has read it, and the
</p>
<p>reading of it will occupy until to-morrow
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  The grand jury were tluree days
</p>
<p>reading it.
</p>
<p>j\lr. Eitzgibbon  But it is premature to call upon
</p>
<p>Iiim to plead now when he has not read it.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  It is not premature when the act
</p>
<p>of parliament directs it to be done.
</p>
<p>Jrlr. M'Donogh  I take the liberty of urging upon
</p>
<p>the court that the application of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General is premature now. There are two questions
</p>
<p>in this case  fli-st, wliat is the meaning of the words
</p>
<p>" on his being charged therewith ;" and, secondly,
</p>
<p>what is the construction of the statute when you
</p>
<p>read the first and eighth sections together? The
</p>
<p>pai'ty is not charged with the indictment until he is
</p>
<p>called upon in due course of law to hear it read to

</p>
<p>him to make his defence. Tliat that is the true
</p>
<p>construction of the statute is perfectly plain on
</p>
<p>turning attention to the first section of it. (Coun-
</p>
<p>sel read the section.) If the defendant shall have
</p>
<p>been on his appearance effectually charged with tlie
</p>
<p>indictment, then he shall be obliged to plead, or de-
</p>
<p>mur thereto within four days, and he has not his
</p>
<p>antecedent common law right of imparlancing, but
</p>
<p>he is not charged here or cannot be charged until
</p>
<p>every syllable of that indictment shall be read for
</p>
<p>him. If the Attorney-General called upon the
</p>
<p>officer of the court to read that indictment from bo-
</p>
<p>ginning to end, which is the right of the subject,
</p>
<p>then when that is concluded, the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>is in a position to say that he shall plead in four days
</p>
<p>from that time. The present application, therefore,
</p>
<p>is premature, for we are not charged with the indict-
</p>
<p>ment until we have heard the indictment read. The
</p>
<p>learned gentleman having referred to the eighth
</p>
<p>section, proceeded :  Its plain and palpable object
</p>
<p>is to give the parties charged with an indictment for
</p>
<p>misdemeanour where questions of very intricate law
</p>
<p>do arise an opportunity of considering the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, and it is a species of substitute for what was
</p>
<p>taken away by the first section. I admit that if we
</p>
<p>were before to-day furnished with a copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment, then, my lord, it would be tantamount
</p>
<p>and equal to reading it for us, and we might be
</p>
<p>deemed to be charged with the indictment.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  How can he furnish a copy of the
</p>
<p>indictment before it is found ?
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  That, my lord, was for the con-
</p>
<p>sideration of the other side. I think it possible to
</p>
<p>have done it ; and if a party wish to expedite his

</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  There would be a good deal of
</p>
<p>weight in what Mr. Moore said, if there was not a
</p>
<p>distinct provision, authorising the court, if a case be
</p>
<p>made for their interposition, to enlarge the time of
</p>
<p>pleading.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  ^Will there be any time lost to
</p>
<p>the crown, or gained to the opposite party, if the
</p>
<p>rule be entered now to run from to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>It can be done bj' consent.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  Yes, by consent, and if it be
</p>
<p>understood that no application will be made here-
</p>
<p>after to enlarge the time of pleading, it can be done.
</p>
<p> Mr. Moore  I don't think myself warranted in
</p>
<p>entering into any consent. Let the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>have his right if he pleases.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  I understand Judge Cramp-
</p>
<p>ton's proposition is this, that the rule wiU be entered
</p>
<p>now to run from to-morrow, the defendants being
</p>
<p>understood to be now charged with the indictment
</p>
<p>shortly.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-Genoral  T think the proper course for
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the Crown is to read the first count pro
</p>
<p>forma, and they will be charged with it. He can
</p>
<p>then enter it, and the terms on which the rule to
</p>
<p>plead is entered.
</p>
<p>Counsel for the traversers remarked that tliis was
</p>
<p>not done at their instance  it was an arrangement
</p>
<p>between tlie court and tlie crown.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then read from the indict-
</p>
<p>ment the names of the persons charged thereby, and
</p>
<p>the crown agreed that the rule to plead should be
</p>
<p>made on the following day.
</p>
<p>It was then arranged that copies of the indict-
</p>
<p>ments should be furnished forthwith by the Crown

</p>
<p>of eleven o'clock in the forenoon of that day, to
</p>
<p>compare the copy of the indictment with the original
</p>
<p>bill, and they asked then and there, and required of
</p>
<p>tlie said Walter Bourne to allow the said copy to
</p>
<p>be compared with the said indictment; whereupon
</p>
<p>the said Walter Bourne stated that the said indict-
</p>
<p>ment was at his private residence, and not in his
</p>
<p>office, and consequently that same could not be
</p>
<p>compared ; but that he would go for same, and that
</p>
<p>it should be brought to his office in two hours he n
</p>
<p>when he would allow same to be compared ; an''
</p>
<p>ANOTHER INDICTMENT MKNTIONED.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, -when the former question
</p>
<p>had been decided, said  Imust trouble the grand jury
</p>
<p>to be in attendance in the morning. There is ano-
</p>
<p>ther bill to go up against four of the defendants. It
</p>
<p>is ready now, but it is too late to get into it. I don't
</p>
<p>tliink, gentlemen, it will occupy much of your time,
</p>
<p>but I must request you will attend to-morrow morn-

<p>ing. The jury then retired. [This bill was never

<p>subsequently mentioned, and was never sent before

<p>Thursday, Novemheb 9.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton sat at half-past ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>He retired about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock,
</p>
<p>to join the other judges, intimating that the court
</p>
<p>would sit again. The Chief Justice and the other
</p>
<p>members of the court took their seats on the bench
</p>
<p>at twenty minutes past four o'clock. Mr. Sheil
</p>
<p>was also in court, and sat in the inner bar.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said the court were very sorry

<p>THE INDICTMENT.
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>The Attorney and Solicitor- Generals entered the
</p>
<p>court.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Mr. Attorney-General, an applica-
</p>
<p>tion is made to the court, on behalf of the parties
</p>
<p>accused, that the copies of the indictment, or at
</p>
<p>least one of them, that had heen furnished, should
</p>
<p>be compared, and that they should be at liberty to
</p>
<p>compare it with the original.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  I apprehend that all the co-
</p>
<p>pies that hare been served on the parties have been,
</p>
<p>according to the course of the court, certified by the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Cro^vn ; if that be the case, I certainly
</p>
<p>do not feel that there should be anything done out
</p>
<p>of the ordinary course in the present case. I beUeve
</p>
<p>those several copies have been certified to be true
</p>
<p>copies of the indictment.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Is that the fact?
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown  They are, my lord.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside supported the application, and re-
</p>
<p>ferred to the fact, that alterations had been already
</p>
<p>made in the indictment wlien it was before the

<p>grand jury. It was not too much to ask to have
</p>
<p>one topy compared, when the Crown Solicitor said
</p>
<p>it was the right of the party. They merely asked
</p>
<p>that to be done, which was promised by the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Crown to be done, but which had not been
</p>
<p>done. If any oflScer thought fit to certify that tliis
</p>
<p>was a true copy, he was not to conclude the party
</p>
<p>by it.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The common course of the court,
</p>
<p>both criminal and civil, is not merely to give a cer-
</p>
<p>tified copy, but a compared copj'.
</p>
<p>SoUcitor-General  This is, 1 understand, certified
</p>
<p>to be so.

<p>Mr. Ford referred to a copy of the indictment
</p>
<p>wliieh he held in his hand, on which was written 
</p>
<p>"A true bill  for self and fellows, George Brooke."
</p>
<p>"A copy  Walter Bourne."
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  But it cannot be certified to be
</p>
<p>a copy except by comparison.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I don't think any objection can
</p>
<p>be made to the application, and they only require
</p>
<p>one copy to be compared.
</p>
<p>Mr. Heun That is all.
</p>
<p>Attorney- General  I don't apprehend it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary to go into particulars, but I object to their
</p>
<p>right to see anything endorsed upon the bill. 
</p>
<p>They have no right to see the bill of indictment, or
</p>
<p>the names of the witnesses on the back of that bill.
</p>
<p>SoUcitor-General  If the court think right to di-
</p>
<p>rect the ofilcer to compare it, it is all right ; but the
</p>
<p>parties have no right to see it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  All we require is to have the copy
</p>
<p>compared in the ordinary way. I submit that the
</p>
<p>rule to plead should only run from the time we have
</p>
<p>compared it.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  ^1 think this is the subject matter
</p>
<p>of a distinct and independent motion, and one of
</p>
<p>which you should give notice to the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, if you intend to bring the matter before the
</p>
<p>court. I think the motion you have already made
</p>
<p>is, that you should have a compared as well as a
</p>
<p>certified copj^.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  It cannot be said that we got a copy
</p>
<p>at all, until we have it compared ; and, therefore, is
</p>
<p>it not from that time the rule is to run?
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  No, it is not from that time.

<p>Mr. M'Donogh applied that they should be fur-

<p>has been furnished, and if it appear to be an imper-
</p>
<p>fect copy, will not the court make him obey its for-
</p>
<p>mar order, and that is all we ask.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I conceive you cannot make this
</p>
<p>application without notice, Mr. Heun, the more
</p>
<p>especially as the Attorney-General has said tliat if
</p>
<p>he gets notice he will oppose your motion.

<p>Mr. Cantwell  Then we wUl give notice for to-

<p>morrow.

<p>A ttorney-General  ^I insist in a case of this kind
</p>
<p>that the usual course of the court shall he adopted.
</p>
<p>I will not take notice for to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>Mr. AVhiteside  It is for the court to decide
</p>
<p>whether a short notice shall he given or not. It is
</p>
<p>plain that it is the right of the party to obtain the
</p>
<p>document, and that document, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>order of the court, is withheld.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  You have no right to assume that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  We have a right to ask that the
</p>
<p>court allow us to give notice for to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton  You may give notice for further
</p>
<p>time to plead.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Wedon'tmean to ask time to plead.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General again submitted that it was
</p>
<p>necessary the usual notice of motion should be served.
</p>
<p>The precise terms of that notice should be reduced
</p>
<p>to writing, and he should have time to consider it.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  According to the common and or-
</p>
<p>dinary rules of the court, if a party has a motion to
</p>
<p>make he may serve notice of it. That rule is the
</p>
<p>more required to be observed where the counsel at the
</p>
<p>other side says, I have no notice of this application.
</p>
<p>I require notice of it in order that I may be able to

<p>that rule. Why should we now go out of that rule,

<p>the ordinary and common rule of the court, that

<p>notice of motion should be given?
</p>
<p>Mr. M'lJouogh inquired if the court would direct

<p>them to give notice for Saturday?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  We make no order but that the
</p>
<p>ordinary rule of the court be observed.
</p>
<p>IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH,
</p>
<p>Saturday, November 11.
</p>
<p>The Queen V. O^ConneU.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside, Q.C., moved on the part of Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy, that the paper furnished by the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown, as and ibra fair copy of the indictment, be
</p>
<p>amended, by having added thereto the entries and
</p>
<p>endorsements in the indictment, including the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses, which motion was grounded on the
</p>
<p>paper purporting to be an indictment heretofore fur-
</p>
<p>nished by the officer of the court and affidavits tiled.
</p>
<p>The afBdavit of traverser's attorney, Mr. Gartlan,
</p>
<p>identified the document as furnished to them by the
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown, and stated that the matters
</p>
<p>sought by the present notice were not stated in that
</p>
<p>copy ; that it was necessary to have those witnesses
</p>
<p>names, and that the application was not made for
</p>
<p>the purpose of delay. Two questions naturally
</p>
<p>arose : first, was he entitled to this under the strict
</p>
<p>interpretation of the act of parliament, and if not,
</p>
<p>Tvhether under the present circumstances of the case
</p>
<p>it ought to be granted. Having referred to Deacon's
</p>
<p>Criminal Law, heproceeded. The names of all the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses that were examined before a grand jury should
</p>
<p>b endorsed ou the bill of indictment, the witnesses

</p>
<p>and Payne, p. 85, 4 Carrington and Payne, and 9
</p>
<p>Canington and Payne. TTie argument nught be
</p>
<p>urged on the other side, that it was not consistent
</p>
<p>with the particular case before the court that those
</p>
<p>particular names should be furnished; but it ap-
</p>
<p>peared from the prisoners' counsel act, 6 and 7
</p>
<p>William IV., that it was the intention of the legisla-
</p>
<p>ture that there should be no concealment of the
</p>
<p>parties who swore against the accused man. The
</p>
<p>learned gentleman contended that all the statutes
</p>
<p>upon this point should receive a liberal construction.
</p>
<p>One great reason why, in this case, the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses should be supplied was, that his client, Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy, was charged in the indictment with acts said
</p>
<p>to be done by other parties in remote parts of the
</p>
<p>west and south of Ireland, where he was not when
</p>
<p>those alleged acts were committed. The learned
</p>
<p>cotmsel quoted several authorities in support of his
</p>
<p>position.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General rose to show cause why the
</p>
<p>application made by Mr. Whiteside should not be
</p>
<p>granted ; but previous to entering on the question
</p>
<p>he had to complain of the great irregularity of the
</p>
<p>proceedings on the other side. He had to complain
</p>
<p>that the motion which had just been made by the
</p>
<p>learned gentleman was not, properly speaking,
</p>
<p>exactly germaine to the matter of the notice of mo-
</p>
<p>tion which had been served on behalf of this defen-
</p>
<p>dant, and which was to the following effect. (The
</p>
<p>learned Attorney-General here read a notice of mo-
</p>
<p>tion, purporting to have been served by Mr. M'Evoy
</p>
<p>Gartlan, agent for the defence.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  My lords, that is not ray notice of
</p>
<p>motion, and I know nothing about it (.laughter).

</p>
<p>That is another notice altogether, to which it will be
</p>
<p>competent for the learned Attorney-General to ad-
</p>
<p>dress himself when it comes in due course to be sub-
</p>
<p>mitted to the consideration of the court. Here is
</p>
<p>my notice of motion, my lords, which I will read for
</p>
<p>you. It is, my lords, to the effect, that the paper
</p>
<p>furnished to my client by the Clerk of the Crown as
</p>
<p>and for a copy of the indictment, be amended, by
</p>
<p>having thereto added the names of the witnesses
</p>
<p>examined before the grand jurors, which are en-
</p>
<p>dorsed upon the back of the document. Now, let
</p>
<p>me see what valid objection the crown can urge
</p>
<p>against so fair and legitimate a proposition ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said he was well aware that
</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside, or rather his solicitor, had given such
</p>
<p>a notice of motion as he had now read, and it was
</p>
<p>the same which he had just moved, but he found that
</p>
<p>a second notice of motion had also been proved on
</p>
<p>behalf of this same defendant, which second notice,
</p>
<p>though it differed slightly, perhaps, in language,
</p>
<p>did not differ in any essential or substantial respect
</p>
<p>whatsoever from the first. Now, he wished to learn
</p>
<p>from Mr. Wliiteside, whether it was his intention to
</p>
<p>abandon the second notice of motion, or to bring it
</p>
<p>forward, for, in case the learned gentleman had re-
</p>
<p>solved upon adopting the latter course, he (the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General) contended that he ought to submit
</p>
<p>it at once to the consideration of the court, for, by
</p>
<p>bringing both notices simultaneously forward, he
</p>
<p>(the Attorney-General) could consoUdate liis oppo-
</p>
<p>sition to both applications, and so need only address
</p>
<p>the court once. He really did not think it at all
</p>
<p>reasonable that he should be called upon to give dis-
</p>
<p>tinct and separate oppositions to two motions, which
</p>
<p>20

</p>
<p>words or not. He would now come to the subject-
</p>
<p>matter of the present motion, which was one their
</p>
<p>lordships would acknowledge to be one of a some-
</p>
<p>what strange and unprecedented character. He
</p>
<p>would not, on the present occasion, enter into that
</p>
<p>branch of the case which was referred to in the
</p>
<p>second notice wliich had been served on behalf of
</p>
<p>the present defendant  he would reserve his re-
</p>
<p>marks upon the legal propriety or impropriety of
</p>
<p>the defendant being furnished with a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption of the indictment until a fitting opportunity
</p>
<p>shoidd arise  until some move towards this point
</p>
<p>should be made by the opposite counsel ; and when-
</p>
<p>ever this was done, he trusted that he would be able
</p>
<p>to demonstrate to the entire satisfaction of the court
</p>
<p>that the defendants had not a particle of right in
</p>
<p>law to be furnished with a copy of the caption.
</p>
<p>This was not, however, the question now under con-
</p>
<p>sidei-ation. He would confine liimself to tlie pro-
</p>
<p>position for which Mr. Whiteside had so strenuously
</p>
<p>contended  namely, that the defendant was entitled
</p>
<p>to a copy of the endorsement on tlie indictment
</p>
<p>containing the names of the witnesses, and, by a
</p>
<p>brief reference to the law authorities on the subject,
</p>
<p>and to the course of practice from time immemorial,
</p>
<p>he was confident of being able to convince their
</p>
<p>lordships that the concession of such a proposition
</p>
<p>would be directly at variance with law, justice, and
</p>
<p>expediency. The counsel on the other side con-
</p>
<p>tended that the witnesses' names constituted a por-
</p>
<p>tion of the indictment, and that for this reason tlie
</p>
<p>defendant was entitled to a copy of them. He
</p>
<p>utterly denied that the legislature could ever have
</p>
<p>had any such thing in their contemplation as that

</p>
<p>the names of the witnesses should be furnished to
</p>
<p>the accused, and he contended that they constituted
</p>
<p>in law no portion of the indictment. Much had
</p>
<p>been said about the 8th section of the act of
</p>
<p>parliament referi-ed to, which appeared to be the
</p>
<p>authority upon which the learned gentleman at
</p>
<p>the other side principally grounded his motion j
</p>
<p>but a false construction had been put upon that
</p>
<p>section, the object of wliich was merely to con-
</p>
<p>cede to an accused party the right in certain
</p>
<p>cases of obtaining free of expense a copy of that
</p>
<p>which he previously could only get by paying for it.
</p>
<p>This was what the legislature had in contemplation,
</p>
<p>but in the act which conferred this right, he found
</p>
<p>nothing whatsoever that conferred any such privi-
</p>
<p>lege as was contended for by Mr. AVhiteside. He
</p>
<p>appealed confidently to the experience of the court,
</p>
<p>and maintained that a reference to the course of
</p>
<p>legal practice from the remotest periods to the pre-
</p>
<p>sent hour, would clearly substantiate the fact, that
</p>
<p>as well in this country as in England the practice
</p>
<p>was utterly unknown of furnishing to accused parties
</p>
<p>in the copy of the indictment the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses. He appealed to the experience of their
</p>
<p>lordships as to what the practice was in Ireland ;
</p>
<p>they must know that the tMng was unheard of, and
</p>
<p>that no such custom was permitted to prevail in
</p>
<p>Kngland was a fact wliich he could prove by refer-
</p>
<p>ence to a recent decision by one of the judges of the
</p>
<p>English Court of Queen's Bench, which decision was
</p>
<p>completely opposite in the present instance. The
</p>
<p>case to which he alluded being of recent date, liad
</p>
<p>not as yet found its way into the regular law reports ;
</p>
<p>but it was reported in page 996 of the Jurist for 1842.

</p>
<p>e. Kelly, 1, W. B ; Lewins's C. Cases, 1,206; and
</p>
<p>the statute only gives that indictment free of ex-
</p>
<p>pense. Now, what is an indictment? Not the
</p>
<p>parchment, nor the statement of the charge written
</p>
<p>on it, but the bill as it comes found from the grand
</p>
<p>jury. Until then it is no indictment, and a neces-
</p>
<p>sary part of its description is, that it must be sent
</p>
<p>to the grand jury with the names of the witnesses
</p>
<p>endorsed upon it. This provision is made by the
</p>
<p>late statutes 1 and 2 Vic, c. 37 ; and the peculiarity
</p>
<p>of that statute makes the mere novelty of this mo-
</p>
<p>tion no argument against it. With those names
</p>
<p>endorsed, and the finding also endorsed, the bill
</p>
<p>comes back to the Clerk of the Crown ; and then
</p>
<p>only is it an indictment  Dickenson, 153 ; Jabbet,
</p>
<p>196; 1 Salk., 376. If this be so, it has at least
</p>
<p>three necessary parts  the statement, the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses, and the finding  any one of which
</p>
<p>being absent, it is no indictment It cannot be con-
</p>
<p>tended that we would have had a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment within the meaning of the statute, if the find-
</p>
<p>ing has been omitted ; and this is practically cou-
</p>
<p>ched, for the copy furnished to us has the endorse-
</p>
<p>ment "a true bill." This isapart of the indictment,
</p>
<p>as is shown in Yelverton 99, Chitty C. Law 324,
</p>
<p>Comyn's Indictment A. The late statute makes
</p>
<p>the endorsement of the names essential before the
</p>
<p>bill is found at all ; and is it to be said that this en-
</p>
<p>dorsement is less a part of the indictment than the
</p>
<p>other wliich is subsequent to it, and could never be
</p>
<p>made if it had not preceded ? If the one is part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, is not the other?  and if we are en-
</p>
<p>titled to the one, why not to the other ? Mr. O'Ha-
</p>
<p>gan then proceeded to argue that the treason act

</p>
<p>7 Wm. III., c. 3  as interpreted by the judges, was
</p>
<p>a legislative declaration on the subject. That act
</p>
<p>provided that the person indicted should have a true
</p>
<p>copy of the wliole indictment, but not the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses, implying, by the exception, that if it
</p>
<p>had not been inserted the right to the indictment
</p>
<p>must have included a right to the names. And that
</p>
<p>the names of the witnesses in that statute meant the
</p>
<p>names endorsed on the indictment might be consi-
</p>
<p>dered settled by the authority of Lord Cliief Justice
</p>
<p>Downes State Trials, 31, 374. If they be so, and if
</p>
<p>the acts regarding subject matter of the same kind
</p>
<p>are to be read together, the omission in the second
</p>
<p>of an important exception stated in the first, amounts
</p>
<p>to a declaration that the legislature did not intend
</p>
<p>to apply the exception to the second. In Delap v.
</p>
<p>Leonard, 5, Iiish Law Keports, 308, the Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice referring to the omission in the 4 S. t. c. 5,
</p>
<p>of the reference to a right of entry contained in the
</p>
<p>act of Anne, declares that it must be considered in-
</p>
<p>tentional, and that an equitable construction should
</p>
<p>he put on the statute, so as to carry out its inten-
</p>
<p>tion. This was an authority on the construction of
</p>
<p>the act now under consideration, and opened pro-
</p>
<p>perly the second branch of the argument  namely,
</p>
<p>that even if the endorsement were not strictly a part
</p>
<p>of the indictment, a liberal interpretation of the act
</p>
<p>would entitle the defendant to carry his motion.
</p>
<p>Legislation in modern times has been directed to en-
</p>
<p>large the pri\ileges of accused persons, and mitigate
</p>
<p>the liarshness of the common law. The prisoners'
</p>
<p>counsel's bill recites that it is just and reasonable
</p>
<p>that persons charged with offences should be enabled
</p>
<p>to make full answer and defence ; and reading the

</p>
<p>held back. Sergeant Taliburd acceded to the
</p>
<p>demand, and the witness was produced. There it
</p>
<p>"tras plain that Mr. Roebuck must have seen the en-
</p>
<p>dorsement or he could not hare made such a demand
</p>
<p>at all, and why should the liberty given in England
</p>
<p>be denied in Ireland ? Why should the traverser in
</p>
<p>this case not be enabled to insist on the production
</p>
<p>of aU the witnesses, and for that purpose be allowed
</p>
<p>to learn their names ? It would be a strange doctrine
</p>
<p>to admit the legal right, and at the same time render
</p>
<p>its assertion impossible by withholding the only con-
</p>
<p>ceivable means of asserting it. Mr. O 'Hagan then
</p>
<p>Baid that the English decisions as to the right of a
</p>
<p>prisoner to a copy of the caption applied strongly
</p>
<p>to this case. Though the caption was not a part of
</p>
<p>the indictment, the judges of England had unani-
</p>
<p>mously held a prisoner charged with treason, enti-
</p>
<p>tled to that caption under the act, merely granting
</p>
<p>him, in terms, the indictment, and for the wise and
</p>
<p>humane reason, that it was as necessary to enable
</p>
<p>him to plead and defend himself as any part of the
</p>
<p>indictment, 1 East Pleas of the Crown 1 13, Foster
</p>
<p>229, 230. This principle applied to, and ought to
</p>
<p>govern, the present case, for the endorsement was
</p>
<p>clearly as necessary to the defence as the caption
</p>
<p>could be. In fact, it must often be more necessary,
</p>
<p>and the construction of the treason act, in this
</p>
<p>respect, should go very far to decide this motion in
</p>
<p>favour of the defendant. He called on the court to
</p>
<p>interpret the statute liberally, and in the benignant
</p>
<p>spirit of modern legislation. The changes of latter
</p>
<p>days had taken away the strongest arguments which
</p>
<p>could be urged on the part of the prosecution. They
</p>
<p>aU tended to atford the accused a full and fair oppor-

<p>and the law which had given him a right to the
</p>
<p>depositions of the witnesses could never have in-
</p>
<p>tended to deny him their names. No evil could
</p>
<p>result to the crown if the motion was granted, whilst
</p>
<p>the most serious injury and embarrassment might
</p>
<p>arise to the traverser if it was refused. Relying on
</p>
<p>the letter and the spirit of the act, on principle and
</p>
<p>authority, he submitted that the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment ought to be amended.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General rose to reply.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan objected. He had waited to see if
</p>
<p>any other counsel would follow the Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral, and he submitted that the crown had no right to
</p>
<p>the reply.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General considered that right esta-
</p>
<p>blished, and would not waive it..
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice conceived that it was so.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan said that on trials, or law argu-
</p>
<p>ments, the rule might be settled ; but this was a
</p>
<p>mere interlocutory motion, and that rule did not
</p>
<p>apply. He repeated his objection.
</p>
<p>After some further discussion, the objection was
</p>
<p>overruled.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General said a proposition more des-
</p>
<p>titute of authority than that sought to be supported
</p>
<p>by the learned counsel on the other side, could not,
</p>
<p>in his opinion, be propounded to a court of justice.
</p>
<p>As to authority, he was utterly unable, after a very
</p>
<p>attentive consideration of the argument of his
</p>
<p>learned friend who had just sat down, to perceive a
</p>
<p>single case approaching to an authority in support
</p>
<p>of the point relied upon  namely, that after an in-
</p>
<p>THE INDICTMENT.
</p>
<p>&3
</p>
<p>Uient, and the perfection of it." But that 'meant
</p>
<p>merely, that without the endorsement by the grand
</p>
<p>jury finding it a true bill, it was not a perfect in-
</p>
<p>dictment. He never heard of anything being a
</p>
<p>parcel of the indictment that was not a parcel of
</p>
<p>the record, and Mr. O'Hagan referred to a passage
</p>
<p>in Lord Coke's Reports, that all the Queen's sub-
</p>
<p>jects had, as a matter of right, the power of access
</p>
<p>to public records. There was no doubt on that
</p>
<p>point, but then see to what an extent the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of his learned friend would draw that principle.
</p>
<p>If the names of the witnesses were part of tlie indict-
</p>
<p>ment, they would be part of the record, and then in
</p>
<p>all cases of felony, or of treason, the parties accused
</p>
<p>Would hare a right to take out copies of the record,
</p>
<p>and thus to get a list of tlie witnesses' names, which
</p>
<p>it was well knoivn they were not allowed to do ; and
</p>
<p>accordingly, the record commences with a memoran-
</p>
<p>dum, that at a certain place and time, before a cer-
</p>
<p>tain jury, the following bill was found, but the
</p>
<p>names of the witnesses endorsed on the bill were
</p>
<p>never given. It was, therefore, useless to assert
</p>
<p>that because the act of parliament said the defen-
</p>
<p>dant was to have a copy of the indictment, he
</p>
<p>was also to have a copy of the evidence of the
</p>
<p>crown. When his learned friend spoke of a refusal
</p>
<p>of the names of the witnesses being a hardship, he
</p>
<p>ehould recollect that it was a hardship which was
</p>
<p>not remedied by common law. It was true that
</p>
<p>the legislature had relaxed that rigour to a certain
</p>
<p>extent, and he admitted that any enactment touch-
</p>
<p>ing on the rights of a prisoner, ought to be construed
</p>
<p>in a liberal sense ; and he for one would never be
</p>
<p>found standing up to support a restricted view of

</p>
<p>any such enactment, or preventing an accused party
</p>
<p>from obtaining the full benefit intended to be
</p>
<p>afforded to him ; but there was no trace in tiie act
</p>
<p>of parliament, or in any authority of the right con-
</p>
<p>tended for being intended to be given to a defendant.
</p>
<p>He never heard a more singular argument tlian that,
</p>
<p>because the finding of the jury was sometimes en-
</p>
<p>dorsed on the bill, every endorsement for that reason
</p>
<p>became a part of the bill. Tlie finding was some-
</p>
<p>times on the foot of the bill, and lie was informed
</p>
<p>was so in the present case. The learned Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General concluded, by submitting that no case had
</p>
<p>been made out on the other side why the application
</p>
<p>should be complied with.
</p>
<p>The court unanimously pronounced judgment
</p>
<p>against the application.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh, Q.C., then moved on the part of the
</p>
<p>Eev. Mr. Tyrrell, that a copy of the caption of the
</p>
<p>indictment against his client should be delivered to
</p>
<p>his attorney, or that the copy of the indictment,
</p>
<p>already furnished to him, might be amended by
</p>
<p>adding thereto the copy of tlie caption. He moved
</p>
<p>on an affidavit, which stated that the copy of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment furnished to him did not contain the cap-
</p>
<p>tion ; that a copy of the caption was necessary for
</p>
<p>tlie traverser's defence, and that the present appli-
</p>
<p>cation was not made for the purpose of delay, and
</p>
<p>he hoped to satisfy the court that he was entitled to
</p>
<p>carry that application, and a great deal of tlie rea-
</p>
<p>soning that fell from the learned Solicitor-General
</p>
<p>in the last case was calculated to sustain his appli-
</p>
<p>cation. This was a question of the greatest im-
</p>
<p>portance, and was deserving of tlie most careful
</p>
<p>tonsideration. It was material lo examine the state

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>practice the same as it was in the time of that emi-
</p>
<p>nent judge. Tlie passage from Forster was cited in
</p>
<p>Chitty, and acknowledged during a period of nearly
</p>
<p>62 years, from 1765 to 18J6. In Howell's State
</p>
<p>Trials in 1796, in the case of the King v. Jackson,
</p>
<p>Mr. Ponsonby claimed, on the part of the prisoner,
</p>
<p>to have the caption read, and the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>acknowledged he had a right to have a copy of
</p>
<p>the caption, and therefore had a right to have it read ;
</p>
<p>and when Jackson was brought to the bar to have judg-
</p>
<p>ment passed on him the caption was called for, and
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General conceded the right to have it
</p>
<p>read. In Forster's Discourses on the State Trials,
</p>
<p>p. 230, it was stated that the requisition for the cap-
</p>
<p>tion ought to be before plea; but if the prisoner
</p>
<p>pleaded without a copy of the caption, it was too late
</p>
<p>to make that objection or any other objection. For
</p>
<p>by pleading he admitted that he had a copy sufficient
</p>
<p>for the purposes of the act. By a reference to the
</p>
<p>case of the King v. Cooke, State Trials, it would be
</p>
<p>found that that proposition was abundantly sus-
</p>
<p>tained. He begged to call the attention of the court
</p>
<p>to a passage in Forster, p. 231, the materiality of
</p>
<p>which their lordships would find on referring to the
</p>
<p>statute which they were now going to consider. He
</p>
<p>referred to the 6th George III., and the section on
</p>
<p>which this question arose dealt exclusively with
</p>
<p>State prosecutions. In the language of Sir Michael
</p>
<p>Forster, state prosecutions were peculiarly the object
</p>
<p>of that section. Not only was the object of that sec-
</p>
<p>tion the same, but the language of the section was
</p>
<p>the same, as in the statute of William III. He re-
</p>
<p>ferred to the 8th section. The privilege given there
</p>
<p>was somewhat larger than that given in the statute

<p>of treason, for by that statute there were fees to be
</p>
<p>paid to the officer for the copy. Let them examine
</p>
<p>those statutes, and they would see that there was no
</p>
<p>difference between them. The words in the statute
</p>
<p>of treason were " a true copy of the whole indict-
</p>
<p>ment;" the words in the statute of George III.,
</p>
<p>were " a copy." Tliat made no difference, neither
</p>
<p>did the words " whole and true" in the slightest de-
</p>
<p>gree affect the case. Both statutes spoke of the
</p>
<p>same thingthat was the indictment. The intro-
</p>
<p>duction of the words " whole and true" in the sta-
</p>
<p>tute of treason, and the omission of them in this sta-
</p>
<p>tute did not affect the case. It was not the intention
</p>
<p>of the legislature in the statute of treason that the
</p>
<p>party should have the names of the witnesses, and
</p>
<p>therefore they used the words a true copy of the
</p>
<p>whole indictment, but not the names ofthe wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. The statute of 7 Anne further extended
</p>
<p>those privileges. Tliey found that by that statute
</p>
<p>the names of the witnesses should be given, and
</p>
<p>when it directs that they shall be given it drops'the
</p>
<p>words " true and whole," as in the 60th George III.,
</p>
<p>and says that a list of the witnesses shall be given
</p>
<p>when a copy of the indictment shall be given to the
</p>
<p>party accused; This application for the caption of
</p>
<p>the indictment had this additional auxiliary to sus-
</p>
<p>tain it  that at common law, and from the remotest
</p>
<p>period the traverser in a case of misdemeanour had
</p>
<p>a right to a copy of the indictment. The greatest
</p>
<p>latitude was allowed incases of misdemeanour. The
</p>
<p>traverser was allowed the privilege of imparling in
</p>
<p>that court until the passing of the 60th Geo. III.
</p>
<p>It was deemed to interfere with the due administra-
</p>
<p>tion of justice, and therefore the 60th George III.
</p>
<p>THE INDICTMENT,
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>one of the most eminent .iudges, and most humane
</p>
<p>men that ever lived. Sir M. Forster  the man who
</p>
<p>Blnckstone said had a great mind for crown law ;
</p>
<p>and Chief Justice I)e Grey said that Judge Forster
</p>
<p>might be called the Magna Charta of the people's
</p>
<p>liberty as well as their fortunes. He founded his
</p>
<p>application upon those authorities, and he said that
</p>
<p>what he claimed was the right of every British sub-
</p>
<p>ject. He called for the due administration of the
</p>
<p>law in this case, and he submitted his motion was
</p>
<p>not to be resisted, for he had there the affidavit of
</p>
<p>the Rev. Mr. Tyrrell, stating that it was necessary
</p>
<p>for him to get the copy of the caption, to enable him
</p>
<p>to plead, and that this motion was not made for the
</p>
<p>purpose of delay.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General rose to oppose the appli-
</p>
<p>cation. The notice of motion which had been served
</p>
<p>by the attorney of the accused parly was to the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing effect. (The learned gentleman read a
</p>
<p>notice of motion.)
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  My lords, that is not my notice
</p>
<p>of motion (laughter).
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General  ^^Vell, now, I really must
</p>
<p>in this case, as in the fonner, complain of the irregu-
</p>
<p>larity of proceeding. The notice which I have just
</p>
<p>read has been signed on behalf of the Kev. Peter
</p>
<p>James Tyrrell, by his attorney, and it has been sent
</p>
<p>to the Clerk of the Crown's office.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Yes, and so has the notice which
</p>
<p>I have just moved (laughter). There are two no-
</p>
<p>tices of motion in existence, and they are distinct.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  They are not substantially
</p>
<p>distinct, and I call upon you either to abandon the
</p>
<p>second or bring it on now.

<p>Mr. M'Donogh  It will be brought on all in good
</p>
<p>time, you maj' rest assured (laughter). It will be
</p>
<p>moved by-and-by (laughter).
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice Not by-and-by, Mr. M'Do-
</p>
<p>nogh. It may, perhaps, be moved on Monday, but
</p>
<p>certainly not by-and-by (laughter).
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  My lords, the present motion
</p>
<p>is, that a copy of the caption be furnished to the
</p>
<p>attorney for the accused, or that the present copy of
</p>
<p>the mdictment be amended by the introduction of
</p>
<p>a copy of the caption. , There is another notice on
</p>
<p>the part of the Rev. Mr. Tyrrell, applying for the
</p>
<p>same thing in language somewhat different ; and as
</p>
<p>the notices are not substantially distinct, I do re-
</p>
<p>spectfully urge upon you the propriety of ruling
</p>
<p>that Mr. M'Donogh shall bring on both notices si-
</p>
<p>multaneously, that the same opposition may apply to
</p>
<p>both cases. I do not think it at all reasonable that
</p>
<p>when the subject matter is the same he should first
</p>
<p>take up one notice and then the other, and so create a
</p>
<p>necessity for a double argument on the same question.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh My motion, my lords, is dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly different from that which is still in abeyance,
</p>
<p>nor would there have been any necessity for it, nor
</p>
<p>need there have been any argument at all, if the
</p>
<p>learned Attorney-General had been kind enough to
</p>
<p>give my client the caption when I asked him for
</p>
<p>it the other day (laughter).
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  The two motions are sub-
</p>
<p>stantially the same. Will the court permit them to
</p>
<p>be taken up severally ?
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  I think, Mr. Attorney, you
</p>
<p>ought to have mentioned this before. You ought
</p>
<p>to have stated your objection when Mr. M'Donogh

</p>
<p>difficulty" -which presents itself to my mind in the
</p>
<p>Jiresent case, and it is this : the present application
</p>
<p>is for a copy of the caption. That caption is not as
</p>
<p>yet in existence, nor vrill it, according to the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary course of proceeding, until the last day of term.
</p>
<p>Do the gentlemen who make the application mean
</p>
<p>that the officer should be ordered by the court to
</p>
<p>make up a caption, in order that the accused may
</p>
<p>be furnished with a copy ?
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen Yes ; our application may
</p>
<p>be regarded in that light, iu case there is no caption
</p>
<p>in existence.
</p>
<p>Mr. M-Donogh My lord, we take it for granted
</p>
<p>that the officer has done his duty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton But, then, Mr. M'Donogli,
</p>
<p>it appears that it is not the officer's duty to make
</p>
<p>out the caption until the last day of term ; but let
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General proceed.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General continued to address the
</p>
<p>court Mr. M'Donogh had contended that by the
</p>
<p>construction of the 60th George III. he had a right
</p>
<p>derivable from act of parhameut, to get a copy of
</p>
<p>the caption ; but let them calmly consider what
</p>
<p>could have been the object of the legislature in pass-
</p>
<p>ing that act, and also what was intended by giving
</p>
<p>a copy of the indictment to the accused? What
</p>
<p>was the legal meaning of the word indictment ? Did
</p>
<p>it, in point of law, include the caption or not ? If
</p>
<p>it did, they in being entitled to a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, were of course entitled to that which was a
</p>
<p>component part of it  the caption ; but if, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, it could be shown that the caption, in
</p>
<p>point of law, was no component part of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, it was clear that the accused had no particle

</p>
<p>of legal right to what he was applying for. Now, he
</p>
<p>distinctly asserted, and the whole current of legal
</p>
<p>authorities was in favour of the allegation, that the
</p>
<p>caption was no part of the indictment. He had
</p>
<p>already quoted the words of Lord Hale, who stated
</p>
<p>it as his opinion that the caption was no part of the
</p>
<p>indictment, but merely the preamble or preliminary
</p>
<p>statement, convoying the style and description of
</p>
<p>the court at which the indictment was found. He
</p>
<p>would draw their lordships' attention to a decision
</p>
<p>which was solemnly made by the judges of the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench in England, upon a point exactly
</p>
<p>analogous to the present, when the court ruled in
</p>
<p>express conformity with the opinion of Lord Hale.
</p>
<p>The case to which he referred was reported by
</p>
<p>Sergeant Williams in a note to the case of the King
</p>
<p>t>. Atkinson, as reported in Saunders's Reports ; and
</p>
<p>the question then to be decided being, whether the
</p>
<p>caption Was amenable, the court ruled that the cap-
</p>
<p>tion was no part of the indictment in law. The
</p>
<p>learned reporter who gave the case fully concurred
</p>
<p>in the propriety of the decision, and the doctrine had
</p>
<p>also obtained the approval of so high an authority
</p>
<p>as Lord Mansfield, who had repeatedly adopted it.
</p>
<p>In more recent days this view of the case was also
</p>
<p>fully borne out in " Gabbett's Treatise on Criminal
</p>
<p>Law," where, in vol. 2, page 278, in treating of the
</p>
<p>very thing now under discussion, he expressly said,
</p>
<p>we are to observe the caption is no part of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment itself, but merely the preamble, which
</p>
<p>does not appear until after the return of the writ o1
</p>
<p>certiorari. So they saw that the whole current ol
</p>
<p>authority went to prove that this document, so far
</p>
<p>from being part of the indictment, was nothing
</p>
<p>THE INDICTMENT.
</p>
<p>Sir
</p>
<p>Mr. Napier, on the part of the crowu, read an ex-
</p>
<p>tract from that case, in Burke's Reports, 134.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen said that decision was in a
</p>
<p>Vrrit of error, and not in a motion, whereas the Queen
</p>
<p>. Gregg was directly in point.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said they could not think of
</p>
<p>giving up a very important privilege that in this
</p>
<p>country always helonged to the law officers of the
</p>
<p>crown, when they appeared. In the case of the
</p>
<p>Queen v. Kirwan that right was controverted
</p>
<p>by the defendant's counsel, hut the court held
</p>
<p>that the crown had the right to reply.
</p>
<p>Jlr. Justice Perrin said the case of the ICing v.
</p>
<p>Frost was otherwise ; but he should say that the prac-
</p>
<p>tice in Ireland was, that the person who did not begin
</p>
<p>was to reply. That was Irish practice (laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton said he would not then give
</p>
<p>aay opinion whether it was or was not an incon-
</p>
<p>venient practice, but he recollected that in the case
</p>
<p>of the King v. O'Connell he was himself cotmsel on
</p>
<p>the part of the crown on a motion to withdraw a
</p>
<p>demurrer, and it was then ruled that the crown had
</p>
<p>the right to reply.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin said on that occasion he was placed
</p>
<p>in the same position which Sir Colman O'Loghlen
</p>
<p>now occupied, and he insisted on his right to reply,
</p>
<p>hut the court told him to go on.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan said the last cjise that had been
</p>
<p>decided was the other way.
</p>
<p>The Cliief Justice said he did not understand why
</p>
<p>there should be a difference between the practice in
</p>
<p>an important case and a trivial case. He always con-
</p>
<p>sidered it to be the privilege of the crown to reply
</p>
<p>in all cases.

<p>Mr. M'Donogh said it would be probably unneces-
</p>
<p>sary for their lordships to interfere, as the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General said, in the last case, that he would be the
</p>
<p>last man to stand up in support of any rule that
</p>
<p>pressed on a defendant (laughter').

<p>The Chief Justice called upon Sir Colman O'Loghlen
</p>
<p>to proceed with the argument o ' this case, which

<p>stood over from Saturday evening.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen said that in this case he ap-
</p>
<p>peared as counsel fOr the Rev. Mr. TjTrell, and as
</p>
<p>their lordships had decided upon Saturday that if he
</p>
<p>had any observations to offer to the court he should
</p>
<p>offer them at tliis stage of the proceedings, it was his

<p>duty to show tliat he was entitled to carry this motion,

<p>notwithstanding the arguments of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General. At the commencement of the case, and
</p>
<p>before going into the law of the case, he would re-
</p>
<p>ftiind them of two facts. In the first instance he
</p>
<p>Would remind their lordships that this motion was
</p>
<p>not a motion to enlarge the time to plead or alter
</p>
<p>the rules to plead ; but it was simply aud solelj' for
</p>
<p>the purpose of obtaining for liis chent that which he
</p>
<p>believed he was entitled to, and liis appHcation was
</p>
<p>grounded not alone upon its own merits, but he had
</p>
<p>in its support the affidavit of liis client's solicitor,
</p>
<p>who stated that this motion was not made for the
</p>
<p>purpose of delay, aud that it was necessary for his
</p>
<p>client's defence that he should have a copy of the

</p>
<p>phus, where the court granted a mandamus to the
</p>
<p>sessions' court to make up the record, and a fortiiri,
</p>
<p>ivould it refuse to make its own officer do so ? Not
</p>
<p>only had they that authority, but they had an au-
</p>
<p>thority in Hawkins in support of tliat very princi-
</p>
<p>ple. In Hawkins, B 2, chap. 25, sec. 97, it is said
</p>
<p>" a caption is left as a thing of course to be drawn
</p>
<p>up by the clerk of the court when occasion shall re-
</p>
<p>quire," and there was no time when occasion re-
</p>
<p>quired it more than when a party applied for a copy
</p>
<p>of it. If there was any force in that authority in
</p>
<p>the practice in cases of high treason, it was clear,
</p>
<p>in point of law, that the caption should be made up
</p>
<p>the moment the indictment was found ; and if it
</p>
<p>were not made up the court would direct the officer
</p>
<p>to do so. Having said so much on this part of the
</p>
<p>case, he would now come to consider what was the
</p>
<p>real purport of tliis motion, and that was, were they
</p>
<p>entitled to a copy of the caption, supposing it to be
</p>
<p>made up ? He submitted they were entitled to it ;
</p>
<p>first, on principle, and in the second place, on the
</p>
<p>statute law ; and if there was no statute they were
</p>
<p>entitled to it at common law. Tliey were entitled
</p>
<p>to a copy of the caption in the first place upon prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, for they were entitled to be put in a position
</p>
<p>that they could take advantage of any defence which
</p>
<p>the law allowed them. See the position they were
</p>
<p>in at the present moment. They had an indictment
</p>
<p>before them, and at present they could not legally
</p>
<p>know anything about that indictment, except that
</p>
<p>it was an indictment for conspiracy. Of course they
</p>
<p>might know it as a matter of rumour, but they
</p>
<p>could not know from the indictment when it was
</p>
<p>found, where it was found, or by whom it was

</p>
<p>found. But if they had the caption they would
</p>
<p>know it, for the caption contained the style of the
</p>
<p>court, the names of the persons before whom the
</p>
<p>indictment was taken, and the manner in which
</p>
<p>taken, and if the indictment were improperly found ;
</p>
<p>or if they had no jurisdiction, or in several other
</p>
<p>cases that might be supposed. If they had these
</p>
<p>particulars, they might have reason to plead special
</p>
<p>matter  they might plead in abatement, and they
</p>
<p>could not only plead in abatement, but they could
</p>
<p>move to quash the indictment, and not only that,
</p>
<p>but to take advantage of any defect on demurrer.
</p>
<p>That was decided in the King v. Fearnley, 1 Leech
</p>
<p>425, and 1 Term Keport 316, and in the King v.
</p>
<p>Ware, Strange 698. Would it not be monstrous
</p>
<p>that they should have the right to quash the indict-
</p>
<p>ment for a defect in the caption, or to demur to it,
</p>
<p>and that they should not have a copy of it? How
</p>
<p>could they know how to frame their demurrer or to
</p>
<p>plead, except by the copy of the caption which he
</p>
<p>submitted the law gave them ? In the second place,
</p>
<p>he said not only were they entitled to a copy of this
</p>
<p>caption on principle, but were entitled mider the
</p>
<p>statute. The statute to which their lordships had
</p>
<p>been referred, the 60th Geo. III., expressly enacted,
</p>
<p>that in all cases of prosecutions for misdemeanour,
</p>
<p>instituted by the Attorney-General or Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General, the court should, if required, make an
</p>
<p>order that a copy of the indictment after the appear-
</p>
<p>ance of the party prosecuted should be furnished to
</p>
<p>him. The learned Attorney- General on Saturday
</p>
<p>had cited a great number of cases, to show their
</p>
<p>lordsliips that the caption formed no part of the
</p>
<p>indictment, but he thought he should be able to
</p>
<p>(THE INDICTMENT.
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>there was not the slightest difference between them.
</p>
<p>He fully admitted that the wording of both statutes
</p>
<p>was not the same. In the first statute it says " a
</p>
<p>true copy of the whole indictment ;" in this statute
</p>
<p>it says " a copy of the indictment." But there was
</p>
<p>no substantial difference between them ; for how
</p>
<p>could a copy be a copy and not be a true copy ? Did
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General mean to contend that the re-
</p>
<p>quisition under the statute for a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment would be complied with by furnishing thera
</p>
<p>with a false copy of the indictment ? It could not
</p>
<p>be contended that he was only entitled to part of
</p>
<p>the indictment ; and he would remind their lord-
</p>
<p>ships of an observation of Mr. M'Donogh's, which
</p>
<p>showed why the word " whole" was introduced.
</p>
<p>It was the practice before the act to give the pri-
</p>
<p>soner a copy of part of any indictment that he
</p>
<p>wished to make objection to, and it was enacted by
</p>
<p>that statute to give liim a copy, not of part, but of
</p>
<p>the whole. Why should there be a different con-
</p>
<p>struction put upon this act from the high treason
</p>
<p>act, for both acts had reference to state prosecu-
</p>
<p>tions? The Attorney-General had put this con-
</p>
<p>struction upon it : he said that the words in the
</p>
<p>treason statute were introduced in favorem vita.
</p>
<p>But there was no evidence of that ; on the contrary,
</p>
<p>it appeared that the caption was granted to the
</p>
<p>party for the purpose of enabling him to plead to
</p>
<p>the indictment. The words used by Judge Forster
</p>
<p>were the same as the words used in the Pleas of the
</p>
<p>Crown, that the prisoner should have a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption, not in favorem ritre, but because it was as
</p>
<p>necessary to conduct liim in pleading as the other.
</p>
<p>It might be said it would have been easy to put the

<p>word " caption" in the statute. It was true it
</p>
<p>would be easy to do it, but the legislature seeing
</p>
<p>the practice that had prevailed for a century and a
</p>
<p>half on the treason statutes, never thought a dif-
</p>
<p>ferent sense would have been contended for.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice In ordinary cases, except the sta-
</p>
<p>tute of treason, what is the practice ?
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen thanked his lordship for
</p>
<p>calling his attention to that. He would be able to
</p>
<p>show their lordships that in cases of misdemeanour
</p>
<p>the party always got the copy of the caption when-
</p>
<p>ever it was made up. At common law they were
</p>
<p>entitled to a copy of the indictment as matter of
</p>
<p>right  Deacon's Common Law  and a copy of the
</p>
<p>caption was always given whenever it was prefi.xed
</p>
<p>to a copy of the indictment. In support of the pro-
</p>
<p>position he referred to the King v. Marsh, 6 Adol-
</p>
<p>phus and Ellis, p. 244. He would appeal to their
</p>
<p>lordships, and he thought he could state that in
</p>
<p>every case where the record was made up it was the
</p>
<p>custom to give a copy of the caption. Such was the
</p>
<p>practice where proceedings were removed by cer-
</p>
<p>tiorari, and he submitted that in this case the court
</p>
<p>should compel the ofiicer to make up the caption,
</p>
<p>and when it was made up they were entitled to a
</p>
<p>copy of it.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  If you come in here with a
</p>
<p>motion that the officer be ordered to prefer the cap-
</p>
<p>tion to the indictment, it would be well ; but this
</p>
<p>motion is to get a copy of that which is not made
</p>
<p>up.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen said his lordship would re-
</p>
<p>collect that they had been refused to look at the
</p>
<p>indictment, and that they knew not whether the

</p>
<p>Wt that was a case of the removal of proceedings
</p>
<p>after conviction in a court below. No person ever
</p>
<p>denied that proposition, and it was an authority for
</p>
<p>that and no more. He submitted that neither at
</p>
<p>common law or on the statute was there any founda-
</p>
<p>tion for granting the application ; and having re-
</p>
<p>ferred to several authorities in support of his pro-
</p>
<p>position, submitted that the application could not be
</p>
<p>Bustained by reason or authority.
</p>
<p>Mr. Napier stated that in cases of treason two
</p>
<p>counsel were invariably heard on the part of the
</p>
<p>prisoner  one in opening the case, and another in
</p>
<p>speaking to evidence after the case had closed, while
</p>
<p>in felonies and misdemeanours only one counsel
</p>
<p>could be heard.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon Does that give liberty, Mr. Na-
</p>
<p>pier, to have two counsel to speak for the crown ?

<p>Mr. Ford observed that Mr. Napier was the third

<p>counsel that had spoken on tliis motion for tht
</p>

</p>
<p>The Chief Justice, at the conclusion of the argu-

<p>application. He could conceive certain circumstances
</p>
<p>might by possibility exist, which, if properly
</p>
<p>brought betore the court, and openly stated to tht
</p>
<p>court in sufficient documents and affidavits, might
</p>
<p>be forcibly and strongly made use of in order to
</p>
<p>sustain the present application  such as this, for
</p>
<p>instance :  If there was an allegation that the bill ot
</p>
<p>indictment purported to be signed by the foreman,
</p>
<p>on behalf of himself and his brother jurors, and was
</p>
<p>not in point of fact signed on behalf of the majority
</p>
<p>of the grand jury, or in fact that twelve jurors diu
</p>
<p>not concur in the finding of that indictment, ii
</p>
<p>the names of all the jurors did not appear on the
</p>
<p>indictment as it at present stood, the party to ena-
</p>
<p>ble him to make liis defence, by bringing forward
</p>
<p>9uch subject matter as he bad alluded to, might
</p>
<p>make a case to be placed before the court, to show
</p>
<p>them that it might be necessary for his defence that
</p>
<p>the names of all the jurors who found the bill might
</p>
<p>be set forth, which would be the case in the produc-
</p>
<p>tion of the caption, and such a statement as that
</p>
<p>plight probably induce the court to comply with the
</p>
<p>application. He did not put that case from an idea
</p>
<p>that such a state of things existed here, but to ex-
</p>
<p>emplify the proposition he laid down, that perhaps
</p>
<p>a party might bring forward an application of this
</p>
<p>Jtind upon certaio circumstances which would call
</p>
<p>to give a decision in his favour, but which would not
</p>
<p>be the case unless such circumstances wei'e laid be-
</p>
<p>fore the court. Tliis application was not grounded
</p>
<p>upon any special circumstances of that kind, but
</p>
<p>ivas brought before the court and insisted upon, as
</p>
<p>he thought he heard Sir Colman O'Loghlen fre-
</p>
<p>THE INDICTMENT.
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>tice, without authority or warrant, and which was
</p>
<p>now, for the first time, pressed as a matter of right,
</p>
<p>and demanded of the court. Now, in point of fact,
</p>
<p>the indictment, popularly so called, and the caption
</p>
<p>of the indictment, were quite different ; he did not
</p>
<p>say quite different, but tliey were essentially differ-
</p>
<p>ent. The indictment was completed by the finding
</p>
<p>of the grand jury, on their oaths. The caption was
</p>
<p>not made up at the same time, nor had the grand
</p>
<p>jury anything whatever to do with it. It was the
</p>
<p>ministerial act of the officer of the court who com-
</p>
<p>pleted the record, by the introduction of a certain
</p>
<p>description of the court, wliich, in point of fact,
</p>
<p>made no part of the charge, and which was only in-
</p>
<p>troduced on the record, when the record came to be
</p>
<p>properly made out. The present indictment was
</p>
<p>not in a state to furnish the party applj'ing with the
</p>
<p>caption, wMch he applied for; for until the record
</p>
<p>came to be finally made up, and until it was com-
</p>
<p>pleted, there was, in point of fact, no caption in ex-
</p>
<p>istence. To comply with the present application,
</p>
<p>would be, in point of fact, to order the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown to comply with an impossibility ; for there
</p>
<p>being no caption at present, he could not furnish it
</p>
<p>as a matter of right, witli the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. It might be fair, if particular reasons existed,
</p>
<p>to stay other proceedings in ihe office, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of directing the Clerk of the Crown to lay aside
</p>
<p>the other business of the office, and to make out a
</p>
<p>3pecial caption at the suit and instance of the party
</p>
<p>applying. An application of that kind migiit bt
</p>
<p>made, if the ends of justice were shown to require it.
</p>
<p>If the party came to tell the court he complained oi

<p>what the indictment did not in the face of it show

</p>
<p>to them, that tbe bills were only found by eleven
</p>
<p>jurors J and that to enable them to take advantage
</p>
<p>of that in a legal way, he required that a copy oi
</p>
<p>the caption might be made and furnished to him.
</p>
<p>But that was not the present application. They
</p>
<p>Baid that in all cases, without reference to what the
</p>
<p>object was, or staling what the oDject was, they hau
</p>
<p>a right, because that construction was given to the
</p>
<p>statute of treason, to insist as a matter of right thai
</p>
<p>a similar construction should be applied to tlie worda
</p>
<p>of this act. Now he would say that in ordinary
</p>
<p>cases the word indictment did not mean the caption,
</p>
<p>but something else, and different from it, and thai
</p>
<p>a party applying to succeed in their application must
</p>
<p>show that in the construction of the (jOth (ieorge
</p>
<p>in., the ordinary language must be laid aside, and
</p>
<p>the meaning which they gave to it adopted. The
</p>
<p>meaning they gave to it was different from the fact,
</p>
<p>and both fact and law were prima facie against, and in
</p>
<p>opposition to their proceeding. The caption was
</p>
<p>not in existence. The caption could not, therefore,
</p>
<p>be considered as part of the indictment which was
</p>
<p>in existence, and therefore, unless a case was shown
</p>
<p>that they were entitled to adopt the same construc-
</p>
<p>tion that was given to the statute of treason,
</p>
<p>grounded upon its very peculiar circumstances, he
</p>
<p>did not see what right tliey had to say that they
</p>
<p>should take this word "indictment," and use it with
</p>
<p>a meaning quite different from its common one, and
</p>
<p>jnsist that that meaning was the one that should be
</p>
<p>acted upon and adopted by the court. It was enough
</p>
<p>to say that the practice was universally against them.
</p>
<p>This act of 6Uth George III. had been in force now
</p>
<p>for upwards of 20 years  for 23 or 24 years. It had

</p>
<p>dition in which they Vrere placed, the statute obliges
</p>
<p>the crown to give the parties a copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment or informations on demand. And for what
</p>
<p>purpose? Wliy, for his defence, and putting in a
</p>
<p>proper plea is a most essential part of the defence.
</p>
<p>Therefore in his opinion the parties were clearly
</p>
<p>entitled to a copy of the caption to enable them to
</p>
<p>consult with their counsel as to the nature of the
</p>
<p>plea they should put in, or whether they should
</p>
<p>demur to the indictment altogether. The applica-
</p>
<p>tion was made on the analogy of the enactment, so
</p>
<p>that in the statutes of 5 George III., chap. 21, in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, and the 7th William III., and 7th Anne, in
</p>
<p>England, under which statutes it had been held
</p>
<p>tiniformly by the judges erer since the passing of
</p>
<p>those acts, that the party was entitled not merely to
</p>
<p>a copy of the body of the indictment, but to a copy
</p>
<p>of the caption. That was an act not to abridge the
</p>
<p>rights of the accused. That was a statute not re-
</p>
<p>quiring to be liberally construed, because it was in-
</p>
<p>flicting a deprivation or disadvantage. On the con-
</p>
<p>trary, it was an act enlarging tlie rights of the party,
</p>
<p>and giving him additional advantages. It was an
</p>
<p>act of which Judge Foster said that it seemed as if
</p>
<p>it were intended to hold men safe in treasonable
</p>
<p>practice, and yet the judges in putting a construc-
</p>
<p>tion upon that statute said, that the provision which
</p>
<p>gave the prisoner a right to the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment gave him a right to the caption of it. A good
</p>
<p>deal of argument had been used on one side and the
</p>
<p>other as to whether the caption was part of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, and the learned counsel who opened the
</p>
<p>ease disclaimed the notion that it was on that ground
</p>
<p>he had applied to the court, but upon looking into

</p>
<p>the authorities to which he had been referred, and
</p>
<p>on looking into the views taken by the learned judges
</p>
<p>and able lawyers who were considered as autho-
</p>
<p>rities, he doubted very much the soundness of that
</p>
<p>disclaimer. He found in " Hawkins' Heas of the
</p>
<p>Crown," chapter upon indictments, a work of high
</p>
<p>authority, and a writer that never was supposed to
</p>
<p>have taken too favourable a view to those prosecuted,
</p>
<p>that he conceived the indictment consisted of two
</p>
<p>parts, the caption and body of the indictment. In
</p>
<p>" Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown," he states that, "an
</p>
<p>indictment is an accusation at the suit of the crown,
</p>
<p>found to be true on the oaths of twelve men of the
</p>
<p>county returned to inquire into all the offences con-
</p>
<p>tained therein." Now, that being so, is it not neces-
</p>
<p>sary that the party accused should have a copy of
</p>
<p>the caption ? Supposing the caption states on the
</p>
<p>face of it, that the indictment was not found by
</p>
<p>twelve men of the county, or leaves the matter un-
</p>
<p>certain, then the parties would be entitled to demur to
</p>
<p>the indictment.because, ifnotfoundby twelvemen,the
</p>
<p>indictment is bad, or if not found by the twelve men
</p>
<p>of the county, it would be sufficient to warrant the
</p>
<p>parties in demurring. It, therefore, appeared to
</p>
<p>him, according to Hawkins, that the indictment con-
</p>
<p>sisted of two parts, and consequently the accused
</p>
<p>were entitled to the caption as well as to a copy of
</p>
<p>the body of the indictment. 'J'his dictum of Haw-
</p>
<p>kins was not contradicted by any authority except
</p>
<p>by the note to Lord Mansfield's judgment by Saun-
</p>
<p>ders, but he (Judge Perrin) scarcely thought that
</p>
<p>that judgment warranted the conclusions drawn from

<p>it. His lordship says, "that the caption is erro-

<p>had been refused by the court, on the ground that
</p>
<p>there was no precedent for granting such an appli-
</p>
<p>cation. Since then he found a case which went dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly to sustain the riglit of the defendant to the
</p>
<p>list which he claimed. The case he alluded to was
</p>
<p>the King c. Burton, cited in the case of the King i'.
</p>
<p>Dr. Pamell, in Sir William Blackstone's Reports,
</p>
<p>1st volume, page 36, where the Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>of the King's Bench gave it as his opinion that the
</p>
<p>prisoner was entitled, as a matter of course, to a
</p>
<p>copy of the endorsement on the back of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment. He would beg leave to hand up the case to
</p>
<p>their lordships, and call upon them, in accordance
</p>
<p>with that high authority, to direct their officer to
</p>
<p>furnish the defendant with the list of the accusers.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that their lordships
</p>
<p>had already decided on the two motions brought
</p>
<p>forward on behalf of Mr. Whiteside's clients ; and,
</p>
<p>there being no notice of the present motion, of
</p>
<p>course he should oppose it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  In the case I have handed up to
</p>
<p>the court the granting of a list of the names of
</p>
<p>witnesses is mentioned as a matter of course.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  But the objection here is,
</p>
<p>that you are taking the crown by surprise.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside  The crown have nothing to do
</p>
<p>with it (a laugh). I would not ask a favour from
</p>
<p>the crown, because if I did, I know they would not
</p>
<p>grant it (laughter). All that I want is, that the
</p>
<p>ofBcer of the court do tliat which, according to the
</p>
<p>dictum of the Cliief Justice of England, is a matter
</p>
<p>of course.

<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Tou must give notice to
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I did not know that it was in the
</p>
<p>power of the Attorney-General to grant or refuse it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Nor is it m his power to
</p>
<p>grant it ; you are not mistaken there ; nevertheless,
</p>
<p>you must give notice.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that there were eight
</p>
<p>other notices of motion served on the part of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants, upon the two points that had been decided
</p>
<p>by the court, and lie wished to know if they intended
</p>
<p>to move upon any of them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q.C., said they had sent for Jlr.
</p>
<p>Moore who was to move the next motion.
</p>
<p>The Cliief Justice  Very well ; but certainly the
</p>
<p>court will not allow a motion similar to those mo-
</p>
<p>tions already refused, to be now brought forward
</p>
<p>under another name.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon said that the motion was different
</p>
<p>from those which preceded it.
</p>
<p>, The Chief Justice  If I were allowed to give my
</p>
<p>opinion I would say that the two last motions should
</p>
<p>have been moved at one and the same time.
</p>
<p>Tilt Queen y. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, Q.C., said that he had been instructed
</p>
<p>to move an application on the part of Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>one of the traversers, to set aside the rule to plead
</p>
<p>that had been entered. That motion was consequent
</p>
<p>on the two motions which had been disposed of by
</p>
<p>the court, but their lordships being of opinion that
</p>
<p>the defendants were not entitled either to a list of
</p>
<p>the witnesses on the back of the indictment or to a
</p>
<p>copy of the caption, he and the gentlemen with
</p>
<p>whom he acted were of opinion that the ground on

</p>
<p>the persons composing said several meetings re-

<p>place respectively. [Here the document enumerates

<p>the various meetings in the Association and else-

<p>allegations against the Pilot ; forty-one against the
</p>
<p>Freeman ; and thirty-nine against the Nation  all on

</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell handed in his plea, which was en-
</p>
<p>grossed on a large skin of parchment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford stating that the document in question
</p>
<p>was Mr. O'Connell's plea.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Mr. Daniel O'Connell's?
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford Yes, Mr. Daniel O'Connell's.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General wished the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown to read the pleas.
</p>
<p>The other traversers then severally handed in
</p>
<p>their pleas, coming forward to the bench, the laymen
</p>
<p>of them wearing the repeal button.

<p>we want is, that the plea in bar shall be received to-

</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Wlien the matter is discussed
</p>
<p>to-morrow, that and the other circumstances of the
</p>
<p>case will be under the control of the court ; but I
</p>
<p>trust that nothing will be anticipated or decided
</p>
<p>to-day.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The traversers are not to be pre-
</p>
<p>judiced by the matter not being further discussed
</p>
<p>to-day.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  There is no decision calling upon
</p>
<p>us to appear on the part of the traversers, so you
</p>
<p>may argue it yourselves.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I submit that by the course the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General asks the court to take, we are deprived
</p>
<p>of a benefit which we are entitled td  not a benefit
</p>
<p>I would say, but a matter of right  and the reason
</p>
<p>assigned by the Attorney-General discloses that
</p>
<p>fact, for if the pleas were received now, and there
</p>
<p>is no reason why they should not be received, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General conceives it would be necessary
</p>
<p>to serve notice, and that that would cause delay.
</p>
<p>But if so, it was a delay the party were entitled to.
</p>
<p>That notice should apprise us of his reasons for ob-
</p>
<p>jecting to the pleas. He complained of our making
</p>
<p>a motion without giving him two days' notice, and
</p>
<p>is it not reasonable that he should be required to give
</p>
<p>notice to us ?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I doubt if there can be any ob-
</p>
<p>jection to the course the Attorney-General proposes,
</p>
<p>and I say, as a member of the court, that four o'clock
</p>
<p>is not a proper hour to go on with the discussion of
</p>
<p>this case.

<p>[His lordship had scarcely concluded those obser-
</p>
<p>vations when the officer directed the crier to adjourn

</p>
<p>at about twenty minutes to four o'clock without

<p>fm-ther discussion of the case.]
</p>
<p>COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH,
</p>
<p>Wednesday, Nov. 15.
</p>
<p>The Queen v. Daniel 0' Cormell.
</p>
<p>^^ The Chief Justice called upon the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General to proceed with this case, which stood over
</p>
<p>from the previous evening.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General said the question which
</p>
<p>now was raised before their lordsliips was, whether
</p>
<p>or not the pleas wliich were tendered on the preced-
</p>
<p>ing day on the part of the defendants ought, at this
</p>
<p>stage of the proceedings, to be received, and he
</p>
<p>thought it would be found to depend upon the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the 60th George III., c. 4, and he con-
</p>
<p>tended that the traversers were bound, if they in-
</p>
<p>tended to plead in abatement to the indictment, to
</p>
<p>have so pleaded in abatement when they were
</p>
<p>"charged" with the indictment. Such he appre-
</p>
<p>hended was the practice, both in cases of felonies
</p>
<p>and misdemeanours. In 1 Cliitty, Criminal Law,
</p>
<p>p. 447, it was stated that in case of felony or treason
</p>
<p>the plea in abatement may be pleaded ore tenus, and
</p>
<p>issue joined without delay ; but the regular practice
</p>
<p>was to engross it on parchment and have it signed
</p>
<p>by counsel, and the defendant was to deliver it in
</p>
<p>. open court on being charged with the indictment ;
</p>
<p>and in the fourth volume of the same work, Chitty's
</p>
<p>Criminal Law, 2nd edition, in which the precedent
</p>
<p>for plea in abatement is given, page 520, there is a
</p>
<p>note which states the proper time for pleading it. It
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>the rule to plead, or giving the party time to plead
</p>
<p>or demur, is spoken of, that in no portion of the
</p>
<p>section did it contemplate or intend to apply to the
</p>
<p>case of a plea in abatement or plea to the jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion. It was never within the contemplation of the
</p>
<p>act to give the party advantage by way of dilatory
</p>
<p>pleading ; for, if he were right, previous to the act,
</p>
<p>he must plead in abatement on arraignment, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the ordinary course of this court, in which
</p>
<p>rules to plead were entered every day during term.
</p>
<p>The rule to plead was an eight-day rule, and that
</p>
<p>was followed by a rule for judgment unless plea in
</p>
<p>four days, and that eight or four-day rule had no
</p>
<p>reference to a plea in abatement or to the jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion, which must, according to the course of the
</p>
<p>court, be put in in four running days, which would
</p>
<p>include Sundays; and if they applied the practice
</p>
<p>in civil cases to this case, the plea was not in time
</p>
<p>in this case, because the plea was not tendered until
</p>
<p>the preceding day.
</p>
<p>Judge Pen-in believed the practice in that court
</p>
<p>before the passing of the act was, that a party had
</p>
<p>the same time to plead in abatement in the case of
</p>
<p>misdemeanour as in civil cases, and the four days
</p>
<p>there granted ran on the crown side in the same
</p>
<p>way as on the civil side, and it v.'as only in cases of
</p>
<p>felony or treason that the party was bound to plead
</p>
<p>on arraignment.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said if that were the case,
</p>
<p>and from his lordship's experience he had no doubt
</p>
<p>it was, the plea could not be received, for it was too
</p>
<p>late, according to the practice in civil cases, and if
</p>
<p>they wanted to raise the question, they should have
</p>
<p>tendered their pleas on Monday.

</p>
<p>The Cliief Justice said the officer reported the
</p>
<p>practice to be according to Judge Perrin's recollec-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Attorney- General  Then your lordships will find
</p>
<p>that there is an end of the case ; and now that that
</p>
<p>preliminary point was settled by the recollection of
</p>
<p>Judge Perriu being borne out by that of the officer
</p>
<p>of the court, he begged to be allowed again to refer
</p>
<p>to the act of parliament. When the mischiefs to be
</p>
<p>remedied by that act were delays occurring in the
</p>
<p>administration of justice in that court, it was not,
</p>
<p>he contended, to receive a construction that would
</p>
<p>extend the time for pleading dilatory pleas, and that
</p>
<p>was the construction they were called upon by the
</p>
<p>other side to put on the enacting part of the act of
</p>
<p>parliament ; for it was noAv clear that, except under
</p>
<p>the act, their pleas were irregular. He apprehended
</p>
<p>it was clear, on looking to the act of parliament,
</p>
<p>which was passed to prevent delay, that they were
</p>
<p>entitled, at the expiration of four days, unless a full
</p>
<p>defence was put in (that was to lead to final judg-
</p>
<p>ment), to mark judgment ; and ho denied, and he
</p>
<p>thought their lordships would find it clear upon
</p>
<p>principle, that if they should be permitted to put in
</p>
<p>a plea in abatement .at the expiration of four days,
</p>
<p>that would not lead to final judgment. It was
</p>
<p>settled by the authorities that there was not final
</p>
<p>judgment to be had upon it in case a demurrer was
</p>
<p>taken to it, and the defendants would not have put
</p>
<p>in this plea if they had not fully ascertained that to
</p>
<p>be the law. The crown would only be entitled to a
</p>
<p>judgment respondeas ouster if he was driven to carry
</p>
<p>out the object of dplay bj^ demurring to this plcii 
</p>
<p>1 vol. Chitty's Criminal Law, p. 437. If they were
</p>
<p>THE PLEAS.
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>therefore it \ra, he thought he vas at liberty to
</p>
<p>make his objection without motion. This was not
</p>
<p>a motion ; if it were he would say that the rule of
</p>
<p>the court should apply to one case as well as the
</p>
<p>other, and notice should be giren of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he was not complaiuin.i of the
</p>
<p>conduct of the Attorney-General, or insisting that
</p>
<p>there ought to be notice. He was only saying, and
</p>
<p>he had grounds he thought for stating that the pre-
</p>
<p>sent application came within the rule, but he was
</p>
<p>unwiUing to have any controversy on that ground,
</p>
<p>and was ready at once to discuss the question
</p>
<p>brought forwa,rd by the Attorney-General. The
</p>
<p>argument of the Attorney-General, as he understood
</p>
<p>it, was this, first, he took the case as it would have
</p>
<p>been antecedent to the passing of the act ; secondly,
</p>
<p>he considered how far the act had made any alteni-
</p>
<p>tion in the practice, and whether, under the act,
</p>
<p>they would be placed in a different situation from
</p>
<p>what they would have been, if the act had not
</p>
<p>passed.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General wished to mention a fact
</p>
<p>which he had forgotten to state in the course of his
</p>
<p>argument. Their lordships were aware that an ap-
</p>
<p>plication was about to be made for bills of particu-
</p>
<p>lars, and notices were served on the crown to that
</p>
<p>effect, and he had now to state that all those notices
</p>
<p>had been complied with, and bills of particulars fur-
</p>
<p>nished to the parties on Monday night.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he was not apprised of anytliing
</p>
<p>that occurred with respect to that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster It is now mentioned, that it may
</p>
<p>not come to you by surprise when I state it in reply
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  I must say it comes on me now by sur-

</p>
<p>prise.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  I am surprised at that, when
</p>
<p>you were going to make the motion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  I was not aware of the bill of par-
</p>
<p>ticulars being furnished, and I submit that if you
</p>
<p>rely on any facts you must do so on afiidavit.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General referred to Moody's Crown
</p>
<p>Cases to show, that where a party obtained a bill of
</p>
<p>particulars he could not avail himself of any objec-
</p>
<p>tion afterwards.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore resumed his statement. The first
</p>
<p>ground of argument of the Attorney-General was
</p>
<p>that if the statute had not passed, they would not
</p>
<p>be at liberty now to plead in abatement ; and he liad
</p>
<p>contended that the time for pleading in abatement
</p>
<p>was after the party had been arraigned, and it there-
</p>
<p>fore became a question, when antecedent to the pass-
</p>
<p>ing of this act was the period of arraignment. He
</p>
<p>referred their lordships to 2 Hale's Pleas of the
</p>
<p>Crown, p. 219, in which he described what an ar-
</p>
<p>raignment of a prisoner consisted of. It consisted
</p>
<p>first in calling the prisoner to the bar by name, and
</p>
<p>commanding him to hold up liis hand ; secondly, in
</p>
<p>reading the indictment to him distinctly in English,
</p>
<p>and making him understand the charge ; thirdly, in
</p>
<p>demanding from him whether he was guilty or not
</p>
<p>guilty, and if he pleaded not guilty, the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown jomed issue with him. Now that was the ar-
</p>
<p>raignment, getting him to appear, reading to him the
</p>
<p>indictment, and calling upon him to say whether he
</p>
<p>was guilty or not guilty. AVhat does Hale say after
</p>
<p>that ? He says, " but if the prisoner have any mat-
</p>
<p>ter to plead in abatement or in bar of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, then he pleads it without immediately answer-
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>that there were many cases in which a plea of abate-
</p>
<p>ment put in by a traverser was of such importance,
</p>
<p>and contained as much merits as any plea that could
</p>
<p>possibly be put in, and until an authority was cited
</p>
<p>to establish the proposition, that the rule in civil
</p>
<p>cases was to be applied to crown cases, he would
</p>
<p>submit that the court should not say that was the
</p>
<p>principle of law, and if he were now discussing this
</p>
<p>question before the act of parliament, and if the tra-
</p>
<p>verser had prayed an imparlance, he would contend
</p>
<p>that notwithstanding that imparlance, he would, in
</p>
<p>a criminal case, still have the right to plead in
</p>
<p>abatement. But be that as it may, there was no
</p>
<p>question but the traverser had a great and consider-
</p>
<p>able privilege in his right to imparl to the ensuing
</p>
<p>term, and if there was a case in which the enjoy-
</p>
<p>ment of that right would be of advantage to a man,
</p>
<p>he thought the present was that case. Why, he
</p>
<p>asked the court, was that right given? It was
</p>
<p>given to afford the traverser every possible opportu-
</p>
<p>nity of making his defence. It was given to aflFord
</p>
<p>him every opportunity, in point of time, of making
</p>
<p>himself acquainted with the acts with which he was
</p>

<p>assented that great advantages which the common

<p>law gave the traverser was taken away by the opera-
</p>
<p>tion of the act of parliament in question. It ap-
</p>
<p>peared to him that the act of parliament was to be
</p>
<p>considered in the nature and light of a penal act of
</p>
<p>parliament, because it did appear to him that every act
</p>
<p>of parliament that goes to abridge or qualify the com-
</p>
<p>mon lawright of the party accused, must be considered
</p>
<p>to some extent as a penal act of parliament, and if

</p>
<p>the court should agree with him in that observation,
</p>
<p>he then said, that this act of parliament instead of
</p>
<p>receiving from the court an interpretation for the
</p>
<p>purpose of excluding the party from the benefit of
</p>
<p>any privilege that he would otherwise have, ought
</p>
<p>on the contrary to receive from the court the fullest
</p>
<p>and most liberal interpretation in favour of the party
</p>
<p>accused. Now, his learned friend the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, had |read for their lordsliips the preamble
</p>
<p>to the act, and he said the object of it was to pre-
</p>
<p>vent delay. It was stated in that preamble, that
</p>
<p>according to the (then) present practice, the tra-
</p>
<p>versers had an opportunity of postponing their trial
</p>
<p>to a distant period by means of imparlance, in the
</p>
<p>King's Bench. Now, the thing that was intended
</p>
<p>to be taken away was, that great privilege of im-
</p>
<p>parlance, and that privilege was undoubtedly taken
</p>
<p>away from them. And what was substituted in
</p>
<p>its stead ? Why it was substituted in its stead,
</p>
<p>that he or they shall be required to plead or demur
</p>
<p>to the indictment in four days from the time of his
</p>
<p>or their appearance. Now what did his learned
</p>
<p>friend call upon their lordships to do ? By this act
</p>
<p>of parliament the right of imparlance was taken
</p>
<p>away, and the party was required to plead in four
</p>
<p>days. His learned friend called upon their lord-
</p>
<p>ships to read that, as if it Iiad been to plead in
</p>
<p>bar within four days. Wliat right had he to have
</p>
<p>those words introduced at all? A plea in abate-
</p>
<p>ment was just as valid and good a plea as a plea
</p>
<p>ill bar. A plea in abatement was as much known
</p>
<p>to the common law as a plea in bar. It was often
</p>
<p>Bpeaking equally to the merits, and protected the
</p>
<p>accused as well as a plea in bar ; and when a great
</p>
<p>THE PLEAS.
</p>
<p>plea had been read to their lordships, and Mr. Moore
</p>
<p>had shown that it was not to be taken, although,
</p>
<p>perhaps, in the nature of a plea in abatement, as a
</p>
<p>frivolous or dilatory plea. If it were ruled to be a
</p>
<p>good plea, the indictment must, in the end, become
</p>
<p>a nullity, and, therefore, the defendants were enti-
</p>
<p>tled to the favouralile consideration that they had
</p>
<p>pleaded in abatement at the first step, and had not
</p>
<p>waited the termination of the trial to raise the ob-
</p>
<p>jection. On Saturday last, the llth of November,
</p>
<p>the attorneys for the accused addressed a letter to
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne, the Clerk of the Crown. He then read
</p>
<p>the letter, which was as follows :

<p>bound by the rule to plead entered herein, and of
</p>
<p>which a copy is subjoined, to plead or demur in the

<p>He did not know whether liis learned and able friend

</p>
<p>side was to limit the time to plead to two days, and
</p>
<p>to indnde Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday,
</p>
<p>as the four days under the rule. He cited Starkey's
</p>
<p>Criminal Pleadings, 1st vol. p. 310, and then said,
</p>
<p>that independent of those authorities, he considered
</p>
<p>that the case which he sought to establish rested on
</p>
<p>the true and legitimate construction of the act of
</p>
<p>parUament, of the 60th Geo. III. alone. The object
</p>
<p>of the legislature being to prevent delay, took away
</p>
<p>the right of imparlance, and gave the party four
</p>
<p>days to plead, even a dilatory plea. It was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to be a substantive enactment with respect
</p>
<p>to a plea in bar, or a demurrer, and he did not see
</p>
<p>on what printiple his learned friend, the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, could assert that it did not equally apply
</p>
<p>to a plea in abatement. No distinction was taken.
</p>
<p>The plea in abatement is not abohshed  but the
</p>
<p>whole of the old practice is, and therefore all pleas
</p>
<p>stand upon the same rule. The legislature said,
</p>
<p>" we will put aU pleas and demurrers on the same
</p>
<p>footing, and we will give four days to plead any-
</p>
<p>thing the parties have to plead in bar or in abate-
</p>
<p>ment of the indictment," and it would be a mon-
</p>
<p>strous injustice, and a perversion of the law to con-
</p>
<p>strue an act of parliament otherwise that cut down
</p>
<p>the time for pleading from one term to four days.
</p>
<p>There had not been any direct decision in either
</p>
<p>country under that act, and their lordships were
</p>
<p>then to make a precedent that would govern the
</p>
<p>law, he would say, in both countries. He need not
</p>
<p>call their lordships' attention to the case of the

<p>seven bishops, which was a very distinguished case

<p>in the history of the law of these realms. They

<p>rected to plead instanter. They were told that they
</p>
<p>were not entitled to an imparlance, and they put in
</p>
<p>their plea of privilege as lords of parliament, as a
</p>
<p>plea in abatement, and their plea was immediately
</p>
<p>overruled. And why was the law violated in their
</p>
<p>case? Because the Clerk of the Crown certified
</p>
<p>such to be the practice. But in the next reign.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Holt, in a case in 12th Modern, 356,
</p>
<p>decided when the Attorney-General called upon
</p>
<p>the defendant to plead instanter, as in the seven
</p>
<p>bishops' case, that the defendant could not be, and
</p>
<p>was not compelled to plead instanter, and that the
</p>
<p>contrary practice could not be countenanced or up-
</p>
<p>held, and he ruled that the party bad a right to
</p>
<p>imparl to the next term. He thought that the
</p>
<p>safest course for the court now to pursue was this :
</p>
<p>they had got a modern act of parliament, to which
</p>
<p>they were called on to give a construction ; it was
</p>
<p>the case of a criminal proceeding. Would they not
</p>
<p>give the act a liberal construction in favour of the
</p>
<p>accused ? Was not that the spu-it of the British
</p>
<p>law ? or would the court, on the contrary, adopt
</p>
<p>the construction required by the crown, and say
</p>
<p>that the legislature having deprived the defendant
</p>
<p>of his former rights or abuses, if they were such,
</p>
<p>and having in lieu of them given four days to plead,
</p>
<p>did not contemplate pleas in abatement in that ar-
</p>
<p>rangement, and that these therefore must stand on
</p>
<p>the ancient ground ; and that in the present case,
</p>
<p>as the defendants were twelve hours too late, al-
</p>
<p>although they had the certificate of the officer in
</p>
<p>their pockets, stating that they were not late they
</p>
<p>ought to have their pleas refused ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn, Q.C., said he was for another of the
</p>
<p>THE PLEAS,
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>narrow line as undertaking to say nothing that was
</p>
<p>not material, or that had been said before. He
</p>
<p>never gave such an undertaking in his life, and never
</p>
<p>would.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton said the rebuke was called
</p>
<p>for by liis remark, and not by the court at large.
</p>
<p>Jlr. Henn said he did not mean liis remarks ai a
</p>
<p>rebuke. He was about directing the attention of
</p>
<p>tlie court to the case of the liing v. Dickenson, in
</p>
<p>which after conviction it was contended that some
</p>
<p>of the witnesses who attended before the grand
</p>
<p>jury had not been sworn, and lie cited it to show if
</p>
<p>their view of tlie law were right, no conviction could
</p>
<p>stand in the present case. He would submit that if
</p>
<p>there were any doubt in the point, and if the court
</p>
<p>had any discretion in the case, they should receive a
</p>
<p>plea of such vast importance. It had beeu contended
</p>
<p>by tlie Attorney-General that the ouly time for
</p>
<p>putting in such a plea was on the arraignment, but
</p>
<p>he thought that point had been decided by the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of Mr. Moore. Tlie authorities of tlie Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General were all founded on a passage in 2d Hale,
</p>
<p>173, which only went to the extent that if the defen-
</p>
<p>dant intended to take advantage of a misnomer in
</p>
<p>tlie christian name and sirname, he should do so on
</p>
<p>his arraignment. But it was not therefore tlie mean-
</p>
<p>ing of that merely, that they should put in a plea in
</p>
<p>abatement before putting any other plea ? It was
</p>
<p>impossible to contend that the time for pleading
</p>
<p>under the 60th George III. was the time when the
</p>
<p>parties were charged with the indictment. But let
</p>
<p>them see how the case stood since the passing of that
</p>
<p>statute. That act of parliament certainly pressed
</p>
<p>heavily on persons charged with a misdemeanour.

<p>It was, he would say, a penal act, whicli deprived
</p>
<p>them of many advantages which they held before it
</p>
<p>passed, and he should say that its restrictions ought,
</p>
<p>on no account, to be extended. It took away the
</p>
<p>imparlance wliich the defendant had before, but in
</p>
<p>return it provided that he should not, if indicted in
</p>
<p>the Queen's Bench, be called upon to plead until
</p>
<p>after he had a four-day rule served upon liim. That
</p>
<p>act of parliament also took away the old practice
</p>
<p>until then existing, and in the new practice which it
</p>
<p>introduced, it in terms required that the party shall
</p>
<p>plead or demur witliiu four days. On the face of it
</p>
<p>no distinction was made in the different species of
</p>
<p>pleas, and there was not one word introduced in it
</p>
<p>to show that any such distinction was intended. He
</p>
<p>would say that one plea ought to follow the legal
</p>
<p>construction as well as another, and, in a penal act
</p>
<p>in particular, such as that was, the literal construc-
</p>
<p>tion ought to be followed, if the court had any dis-
</p>
<p>cretion at aU in the matter. Before fiUug their pleas
</p>
<p>they made an application to the officer, which had
</p>
<p>been read to the court, calling liis attention to the
</p>
<p>importance of the matter, and to the great miscliief
</p>
<p>that might result from any error, and after receiving
</p>
<p>his certolicate they acted upon it. He would, there-
</p>
<p>fore, put it to the Attorney-General whether, even
</p>
<p>if the practice were what he contended it to be,
</p>
<p>he would press it against them, seeing that they
</p>
<p>would have been misled by the officer. But had
</p>
<p>any authority been cited to show that what the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General contended for was the true construc-
</p>
<p>tion of the act of parUament, and that the legislature
</p>
<p>intended it to exclude a party from their right to
</p>
<p>plead in abatement ? No authority had deen cited,

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mahony  I shall always vindicate myself, but
</p>
<p>I will obey the order of the court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said, he did not impute any impro-
</p>
<p>priety to Mr. Mahony, he merely said the officer
</p>
<p>had been deceived, and he supposed the counsel and
</p>
<p>the attorneys had been deceived also. A mist must
</p>
<p>have obfusticated all his learned friends on Saturday,
</p>
<p>and clouded their understanding in an extraordinary
</p>
<p>manner. They admitted that the plea was ready on
</p>
<p>Saturday, and would it not have been right to tell
</p>
<p>the officers that they had got a plea in abatement to
</p>
<p>put in, and that theywished to know what was their
</p>
<p>time to put it in ? On the contrary they stated they
</p>
<p>wished to know if they were bound by rule to plead
</p>
<p>or demur on Monday. He would say that the rule
</p>
<p>to plead had nothing at all to do with the plea in
</p>
<p>abatement, and that after that rule they had no right
</p>
<p>to put in a plea in abatement. If he had been con-
</p>
<p>sulted as the officer had been, he confessed he would
</p>
<p>have thought of nothing but a plea in chief or a
</p>
<p>demurrer. He would maintain that no rule what-
</p>
<p>ever ought to be taken into consideration in esti-
</p>
<p>mating the time they were to plead in abatement,
</p>
<p>and therefore the officer could only have thought at
</p>
<p>the time of giving his certificate of pleas under the
</p>
<p>rule. If the object of the parties had been to get
</p>
<p>full, complete, and perfect information, would they
</p>
<p>not have asked the officer  " What is the rule 
</p>
<p>whether we plead iu chief or plead in abatement?"
</p>
<p>He was bound under the circumstances to suppose
</p>
<p>that both attorneys and counsel, at the time of
</p>
<p>writing that letter overlooked the extraordinary cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance that they liad prepared a plea in abate-
</p>
<p>ment, or else that they did not think it worth their

<p>while to notice it iu their communication. It was
</p>
<p>strange that gentlemen who had prepared a plea in
</p>
<p>abatement on Saturday, and whose object, above all
</p>
<p>things, was not delay, should on Monday serve notice
</p>
<p>in open court for a bill of particulars, they having in
</p>
<p>an affidavit stated it to be necessary for their pleas.
</p>
<p>That notice was complied with by the crown, and
</p>
<p>it was not, therefore, moved on the day after. They
</p>
<p>said that their object was not delay, but there never
</p>
<p>were men so misled in their own proceedings, or so
</p>
<p>little capable of judging of what they required as
</p>
<p>they appeared in that case to be, though they had
</p>
<p>eight or nine of the most learned men at the bar
</p>
<p>amongst them. They were certainly a simple set of
</p>
<p>poorfellows, and because the officer had misled them,
</p>
<p>or because the attorneys had misled themselves, they
</p>
<p>now called on the Attorney-General not to enforce
</p>
<p>the law against them ; but he trusted that all who
</p>
<p>would so attempt to act would find themselves placed
</p>
<p>in the same position. Next, as to the merits of the
</p>
<p>plea.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I think you may pass that by for
</p>
<p>the present.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said he intended to do so, but if it
</p>
<p>had been well founded, and if it had been pleaded
</p>
<p>when the party were arraigned, as it ought to be, the
</p>
<p>court would, if they thought necessary, have ordered
</p>
<p>the witnesses to be sworn at once, and after a few
</p>
<p>questions were asked of them, the bill would be sent
</p>
<p>down a good bill. That was supposing the law to be
</p>
<p>as the other side contended it was. It had been
</p>
<p>thrown out on the preceding night that that was a
</p>
<p>motion of the Attorney-General, but one of their
</p>
<p>lordships settled that point by explaining it not to
</p>
<p>THE PLEAS.
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton You argue that the word
</p>
<p>"plead" in the act means to plead in bar only.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said he did. He denied that it was
</p>
<p>a penal statute, but, on the contrary, he regarded
</p>
<p>It as a remedial measure, and if the court had dis-
</p>
<p>cretion they were bound to carry out the object of
</p>
<p>the legislature. It was clear the statute giving a
</p>
<p>right to plead double, did not give any right to
</p>
<p>plead in abatement double, and he had several au-
</p>
<p>thorities to show that a plea in abatement should
</p>
<p>be given at the time of arraignment.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  What is the arraignment?
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said the argument on the other side
</p>
<p>was, that the arraignment meant the period when
</p>
<p>the pleas were to be put in ; but he denied that pro-
</p>
<p>position altogether, and in support of his view he
</p>
<p>referred to 1st Byrne, page 2.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin  That authority says, when he is
</p>
<p>called on to answer ; but when is that ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  I submit it is the moment he is
</p>
<p>arraigned.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin  But he is given four days to plead.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  He has four days to plead in bar,
</p>
<p>but not in abatement.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  The statute says that the party
</p>
<p>shall appear in term time to answer, and having
</p>
<p>been so charged, then he is to plead in four days
</p>
<p>after, or if he does not plead within the four days,
</p>
<p>judgment is to be entered against him. The statute
</p>
<p>has taken away certain privileges, and it says the
</p>
<p>party shall plead or demur in four days, and you
</p>
<p>now call on us to say that they are not to plead in
</p>
<p>abatement.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster What I submit on that point is,

</p>
<p>that the statute took away nothing in pleas of abate-
</p>
<p>ment, but left them as before. What it gave was
</p>
<p>in lieu of what it took away, and when nothing was
</p>
<p>taken, he contended that nothing was meant to be
</p>
<p>given.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin said he took it that the arraign-
</p>
<p>ment was the calling on the party to answer. As
</p>
<p>soon as the indictment was read, the clerk of the
</p>
<p>crown should ask the defendant  " How say you,
</p>
<p>are you guilty or not guilty?" But since the pass-
</p>
<p>ing of that statute that question is no longer asked,
</p>
<p>and the four-day rule is put in instead of the
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said the rule was to compel the de-
</p>
<p>fendant to plead, not to answer. He then men-
</p>
<p>tioned 2nd Hale, 175 ; 2ud Chitty, 147 ; and espe-
</p>
<p>cially the case of the King v. Sheridan, as authorities
</p>
<p>in favour on the point.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin  The case of the King v. Sheridan
</p>
<p>was before the passing of the present statute.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said the other case with which he
</p>
<p>would trouble their lordships was the case of the
</p>
<p>King V. Shakspeare, 10th East. Without trespass-
</p>
<p>ing further on the time of the court, he submitted
</p>
<p>that, on these grounds, the defendants were too
</p>
<p>late with their plea, and that the crown were enti-
</p>
<p>tled to mark judgment against them.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice, after a brief conference with
</p>
<p>the other members of the court, proceeded to give
</p>
<p>judgment. He said that in this case of " The Queen
</p>
<p>V. O'Connell and others," the application before the
</p>
<p>court had been treated and argued as, in point of
</p>
<p>fact, he conceived it ought to be, on an application
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General that the respective pleas
</p>
<p>44,
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>and tliat the party had the whole of Tuesday to file
</p>
<p>liis plea. Tliat was another reason why the distinc-
</p>
<p>tion now insisted upon was hardly open to the officer
</p>
<p>of the crown. It was his business, and he (the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice) took it for granted he might assume that
</p>
<p>it was not without the knowledge of tliose concerned
</p>
<p>for the crown
</p>
<p>Tlie Attorney-General thought it right to say that
</p>
<p>he never heard of this untU Mr. Moore stated it in tlie
</p>
<p>course of his argument, and the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>made no communication on the subject to the crown
</p>
<p>officers.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice then would withold the obser-
</p>
<p>vations he was about to make. The Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown was the regular officer of the court in cases
</p>
<p>of this nature. Ke was the proper party to apply
</p>
<p>to J he gave an answer equivocal if it were intended
</p>
<p>to rely upon the distinction between the pleas, but
</p>
<p>perfectly plain if it were not intended to rely upon
</p>
<p>that distinction, and from that answer, it appeared
</p>
<p>that they had Tuesday not only to plead in bar, but
</p>
<p>to put in any other kind of plea they were permitted
</p>
<p>to file. They would now see under the statute whe-
</p>
<p>ther it would be permitted to file a plea of the na-
</p>
<p>ture in question on last Tuesday. He would put it
</p>
<p>out of view or consideration that the general answer
</p>
<p>having been that wliich was given by the ofiicer of
</p>
<p>the Crown office, would, of necessity, have had a
</p>
<p>strong tendency to mislead the traversers applying
</p>
<p>to liim on the subject to ascertain if they were not
</p>
<p>to have as much liberty to plead the one as the other
</p>
<p>plea ; and now whatever might have been the rule
</p>
<p>of the court in civil cases, he apprehended it had
</p>
<p>nothing to say to this. He would say further that

</p>
<p>with regard to the rule of the court as applicable to
</p>
<p>the criminal jurisdiction, there appeared to be little
</p>
<p>or no room for any habit or practice to be resorted
</p>
<p>to under the construction of the statute iu question.
</p>
<p>That statute was passed some three or four-and-
</p>
<p>twenty years ago, and he had not heard it stated
</p>
<p>that a single question as to practice under that sta-
</p>
<p>tute had ever arisen with reference to the point in
</p>
<p>question on which any court was ever called upon
</p>
<p>to make a decision. It was, therefore, a case to
</p>
<p>which the practice in a peculiar case was not apph-
</p>
<p>cablc as a rule upon the subject. Then he had
</p>
<p>already said he did not see the analogy between a
</p>
<p>civil case and a case of criminal jm'isdiction. The
</p>
<p>court were, therefore, called upon to see M'liat was
</p>
<p>the iuterpretation to be put upon the statute in the
</p>
<p>absence of authority, either from decision or from
</p>
<p>practice, and they were obliged to resort for the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the act of parhament not to the internal
</p>
<p>consideration of the things effected by that act of
</p>
<p>parliament, of the privileges of which the traversers
</p>
<p>were deprived, or the benefits which were to be con-
</p>
<p>ferred upon them. It had been truly stated that
</p>
<p>the right of traverse in prox was a most valuable
</p>
<p>privilege, which every person accused of misde-
</p>
<p>meanour under the circumstances stated in the
</p>
<p>statute were entitled to before that statute was
</p>
<p>passed, and the effect of which was that a person
</p>
<p>accused of misdemeanour before the passing of the
</p>
<p>statute, -ivithout preparing for his defence, without
</p>
<p>taking any sort of trouble, except consulting his own
</p>
<p>convenience, was entitled, if he did not chose then
</p>
<p>to go to trial, to defer the trial to the following term.
</p>
<p>Now he must agree in the representation made, that

</p>
<p>that 13 the case of the King v. the Hon. Robert
</p>
<p>Johnstone, reported in 6 East, 583. There was plea
</p>
<p>on abatement by defendant  there was a demurrer
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General ; and having issued the
</p>
<p>four-day rule, there was an application by the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General for a peremptory rule on defendant
</p>
<p>to join in demurrer, the usual four-day rule having
</p>
<p>expired.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Is that a demurrer to the in-
</p>
<p>dictment ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  No, my lord, but as here, a demurrer
</p>
<p>to the plea of abatement put in by the prosecutor.
</p>
<p>There the rule is expressly laid do%vn between cases
</p>
<p>of misdemeanour, which this is, and capital cases
</p>
<p>like that cited by the Attorney-General. The rule
</p>
<p>to which he refers is adopted with regard to capital
</p>
<p>cases, but in cases of misdemeanour there is no right
</p>
<p>in the crown to call upon a party to join in demurrer
</p>
<p>at once, but, on the contrary, there must be two
</p>
<p>rules  one a four-day rule, and the other a peremp-
</p>
<p>tory rule.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell referred to another express autho-
</p>
<p>rity on the subject in 6 Dumford and East, 6 Term
</p>
<p>Reports, 594, the ICing v. Jenevei-. He also referred
</p>
<p>to Chitty's Criminal Law, p. 432, " Chap, on rules

<p>ming's Digest, and Sldnner's Reports. If the At-

</p>
<p>ject they would liave no objection, as was done on
</p>
<p>the preceding evening, to adjourn the case to the
</p>
<p>following morning.

</p>
<p>the practice in England was, the practice was not
</p>
<p>so in this country. In the King v. Kirwan, State
</p>
<p>Trials, 598, two pleas in abatement were put in ;
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General forthwith demurred ore tenus
</p>
<p>and the case was argued on the very same day. He
</p>
<p>must make one observation which he felt strongly
</p>
<p>liimself. He was not aware of the rules that existed
</p>
<p>in the other country, and he knew such rules did
</p>
<p>not exist in Ireland. But, said the learned gentle-
</p>
<p>man, I represent the crown here, my lords, and I,
</p>
<p>with every respect for the court, deny the right of
</p>
<p>the court to delay the proceedings of the crown, and
</p>
<p>representing the crown, I call upon the parties to
</p>
<p>join in demurrer, and I call on j'ou, my lords, to
</p>
<p>prevent your being made a party to the delay that
</p>
<p>is called for.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  I don't think that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General has any right to say delay is called for by
</p>
<p>us. That may be his opinion, but I do not think
</p>
<p>he is warranted in saying that that is the object of
</p>
<p>the present discussion. I am not come here pre-
</p>
<p>pared to argue the case. I could have no knowledge
</p>
<p>of what course the com't would take, or whether
</p>
<p>they should receive the pleas or reject them. The
</p>
<p>courthaving decided that the pleas should be received,
</p>
<p>and the Attorney-General having made up his mind
</p>
<p>as to the course to take, put in a demun-er. The
</p>
<p>proposition which I made is one which cannot, in
</p>
<p>point of fairness, be objected to, .and is an answer
</p>
<p>to the observation of the Attorney-General, that
</p>
<p>delay is intended ; and that is, if it shall appear to
</p>
<p>the court, in the discussion of the case, that he had
</p>
<p>a right to compel an immediate j oinder in demiirrer ;
</p>
<p>that that joinder should take place as of the day the

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>King V. Kirwan which I have already cited, and
</p>
<p>wiiich took place in tliis court, and having referred
</p>
<p>to that authority, I now again caU on the court to
</p>
<p>require the traversers to join in demurrer instanter.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Was there any objection taken in
</p>
<p>that case by the traversers, or any application on
</p>
<p>their behalf, for a postponement ?
</p>
<p>Attorney-General No, my lord, there was not.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  And don't you know that that is
</p>
<p>no authority ?
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Of course I leave the matter
</p>
<p>to the court to have the rule entered.
</p>
<p>After a pause of some moments, 
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General again rose and said  I now
</p>
<p>call for the rule to join in demurrer in four days.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice (addressing the Attorney-General)
</p>
<p>said  When you mentioned the matter at first, and
</p>
<p>cited Layer's case, it occurred to me that what you
</p>
<p>read appeared exceedingly reasonable, and that the
</p>
<p>party who had put in a dilatory plea, which un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly this plea must be confessed to be, should
</p>
<p>be prepared to defend it when called upon to do so.
</p>
<p>I cannot see the reason why a rule should hold in
</p>
<p>capital cases and not in other cases ; and when the
</p>
<p>thing was first mentioned I did concur m your rea-
</p>
<p>sons, and I thought the party were bound to join in
</p>
<p>demurrer forthwith ; but as the practice is reported
</p>
<p>by the oflacer to be to enter a four-day rule, we can-
</p>
<p>not now depart from it.
</p>
<p>Xhe case then stood over until the 20th November.

</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown  I have received the joinder
</p>
<p>in demurrer on the part of Mr. O'ConneU, and the
</p>
<p>rest of the parties indicted.
</p>
<p>The following is a copy of the joinder in de-
</p>
<p>murrer : 
</p>
<p>" IN THE queen's BENCH  CROWN SIDE.
</p>
<p>" Daniel O'Connell and "J " And the said Daniel
</p>
<p>others at the prosecu- ^O'ConneU saith that the
</p>
<p>tion of the Queen. f said plea of him, the said
</p>
<p>J Daniel O'Connell, by him
</p>
<p>in manner and form aforesaid above pleaded, and
</p>
<p>the matters therein contained in manner and form
</p>
<p>as the same are above pleaded and set forth, are
</p>
<p>sufficient in law to preclude our said lady the
</p>
<p>Queen from prosecuting the said indictment against
</p>
<p>Mm, the said Daniel O'Connell ; and the said Da-
</p>
<p>niel O'Connell is ready to verify and prove the
</p>
<p>same, as the court here shall direct and award.
</p>
<p>Wherefore and because the said Right Honourable
</p>
<p>Thomas Berry Cusack Smith, Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>as aforesaid, for our said lady the Queen, hath not
</p>
<p>answered the said plea, nor hitherto in any manner
</p>
<p>denied same, the said Daniel O'Connell, as before,
</p>
<p>prays judgment, and that the said indictment may
</p>
<p>be quashed and soforth."
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General inquired if they were
</p>
<p>handed in personally.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown  They are handed in by
</p>
<p>attorney.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Let me see them.

</p>
<p>the books at their own expense, and they asked for
</p>
<p>no costs for doing so. The books were ready, and
</p>
<p>would havebeen already furnished to the judges,
</p>
<p>but they thought it better to wait until they added
</p>
<p>to them the joinder in demurrer. The clerk had
</p>
<p>now the joinder in demurrer, and would introduce
</p>
<p>it, and their lordships would hare the books witliin
</p>
<p>an hour.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said there was another object for fur-
</p>
<p>nisliing the paper books. They were intended not
</p>
<p>only to give information to the court, but to the par-
</p>
<p>ties, of the points that were intended to be relied
</p>
<p>upon on the other side.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that hitherto the tra-
</p>
<p>versers had adopted the plan of requiring nine copies
</p>
<p>of every document from the crown. He would not
</p>
<p>act upon that rule in this case, but he would give one
</p>
<p>copy of the points to any of the solicitors that was
</p>
<p>named.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell said the question was, what was the
</p>
<p>rule of the Court of Queen's Bench ? They were
</p>
<p>prepared to show that the rule uniformly acted upon
</p>
<p>was this :  when the joinder in demurrer was put in
</p>
<p>there was a rule to join in the expense of books. If
</p>
<p>there was such a rule, and if it were applicable to
</p>
<p>cases of indictments, unless the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>could show that he possessed the privilege not only
</p>
<p>of precedence but of dispensing with the rules of the
</p>
<p>court, or except there was sometliing peculiar in
</p>
<p>this case which distinguished it from all other cases,
</p>
<p>they were entitled to have that rule entered.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said the rule had reference
</p>
<p>to qm warranto proceedings, and had no reference to
</p>
<p>this ease.

<p>Mr. Hatchell  If we had notice we would be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to resist the appUcation.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  I understand that a party who
</p>
<p>pleads in abatement should be ready to sustain liis
</p>
<p>plea when the joinder is handed in.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside said that the court decided that
</p>
<p>they were not bound to argue the pleas when handed
</p>
<p>in. They got four days to give in demurrer, and
</p>
<p>the demurrer in this case, as in any other case, could
</p>
<p>not be argued in this term.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said he took it for granted that
</p>
<p>they would be prepared to goon with the argument of
</p>
<p>the case on the following morning.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside applied to have the time extended
</p>
<p>to Wednesday to aflbrd the attorneys of the traver-
</p>
<p>sers an opportunity to prepare briefs for counsel.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said they already had four days,
</p>
<p>during which it appeared they were doing nothing.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gartlan  We have not a single brief made
</p>
<p>out, my lord.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  It is your own fault that you have
</p>
<p>not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gartlan observed that if the time were not
</p>
<p>extended they must remain up all night to have the
</p>
<p>briefs prepared.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Ford and Cantwell also urged the cowt
</p>
<p>to extend the time to Wednesday.

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Woulfe said  Gentlemen of both grand juries, in
</p>
<p>the last session of parliament an act was passed, to
</p>
<p>which I beg to call your attention, to facilitate the
</p>
<p>administration of justice in this country, and it pro-
</p>
<p>vides that it is no longer necessary, as heretofore, to
</p>
<p>have the witnesses examined by the grand jury, pre-
</p>
<p>viously sworn in court, but they may be sworn be--
</p>
<p>fore the foreman or others of the grand jury  twelve
</p>
<p>of the jury being present. Gentlemen, this is a re-
</p>
<p>medial act, and I shall order it to be sent to you,
</p>
<p>(and he added), my brother judge has suggested to
</p>
<p>me, and I have to state to you that you are not to
</p>
<p>administer the oath to any prosecutor whose name is
</p>
<p>not endorsed on the back of the bill." At the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing commission the Lord Chief Justice Doherty
</p>
<p>and Mr. Justice Johnston presided, and Chief Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Doherty charged the jury. That was in Green-
</p>
<p>street, on the 3rd January, 183ii, which was the next
</p>
<p>commission but one after the passing of the act of
</p>
<p>Victoria, and his lordship stated that they should
</p>
<p>proceed to the gi'and jury room and dispose of the
</p>
<p>cases that came before them with as much despatch
</p>
<p>as was consistent with due deliberation. That as to
</p>
<p>those who were not on the last grand jury, he thought
</p>
<p>it necessary to inform them that there was an alter-
</p>
<p>ation in the practice, and that the foreman was to
</p>
<p>administer to the witnesses the oath that was for-
</p>
<p>merly administered in open court ; and that would
</p>
<p>give them an opportunity of administering that so-
</p>
<p>lemn obligation in a more imposing manner than in
</p>
<p>open court. Since that time, although every judge
</p>
<p>in Ireland had presided at the commission  (which
</p>
<p>was governed by the same provisions as that court,
</p>
<p>and if that court were excluded from the operation

</p>
<p>of the statute, the Commission Court would be
</p>
<p>equally excluded)^that was the practice uniformly
</p>
<p>acted upon, and sentence of death had been pro-
</p>
<p>nounced upon prisoners and carried into execution,
</p>
<p>and at that moment hundreds of thousands (!) were
</p>
<p>undergoing transportation and imprisonment on that
</p>
<p>construction of the act of parliament ; and no later
</p>
<p>than the first day of the present term, when one of
</p>
<p>their lordships was charging the grand jury on the
</p>
<p>present occasion, his lordship was reported to have
</p>
<p>stated distinctly to them that evidence would be
</p>
<p>given on oath, by witnesses sworn by them, the grand
</p>
<p>jury ; and what had been suggested on the part of
</p>
<p>the traversers was this  that it was his duty, as
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, to throw aside the deliberate opi-
</p>
<p>nions of the learned judges of Ireland, acted upon
</p>
<p>since the statute passed, and to adopt a course which
</p>
<p>would throw an imputation on the correctness of
</p>
<p>that construction on which men sufiered death and
</p>
<p>transportation, and adopt a construction that, if
</p>
<p>well founded, would lead to the pardon of every man
</p>
<p>now undergoing sentence of transportation or im-
</p>
<p>prisonment from the Commission Court. He trusted
</p>
<p>that was a sufficient vindication of the course it had
</p>
<p>been his bounden duty to pursue ; and he would not
</p>
<p>be deserving of holding his office for an hour if he
</p>
<p>were capable of taking any other course, and he
</p>
<p>trusted that would silence some of the observations
</p>
<p>which persons, in ignorance of the law and in igno-
</p>
<p>rance of the facts, liad thought proper to make on
</p>
<p>the course pursued in this case. But he was not
</p>
<p>going to rest his argument, strong as that would be,
</p>
<p>on the opinions of all the judges of Ireland that pre-
</p>

</p>
<p>with tlie existing practice of finding Ijills on sworn
</p>
<p>infoiinations witiiout tlie viva voce evidence of the
</p>
<p>witnesses themselves. That was tlie mischief to he
</p>
<p>remedied; and the act directed that a viva voce
</p>
<p>examination of witnesses should take place, and
</p>
<p>that that was to be under the sanction of an oath.
</p>
<p>It did state cert.ainly that the oath was to be admi-
</p>
<p>nistered in court ; but that was not the object of
</p>
<p>the act. The object of the act was, that there
</p>
<p>should be a viva voce examination on the testimony
</p>
<p>of sworn witnesses ; and, accordingly, that act was
</p>
<p>passed, and the practice arose under that act of
</p>
<p>swearing the witnesses that were to be examined
</p>
<p>before the grand jury in court, and the witnesses,
</p>
<p>on being sworn, were sent before the grand jury.
</p>
<p>He prayed the attention of the court to this fact
</p>
<p>that was not questioned upon the other side,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, the plea admitted it, and there
</p>
<p>was no doubt on the subject. The plea was
</p>
<p>that the witnesses should he sworn in that court
</p>
<p>under the 56th George III. ; that was a general
</p>
<p>provision extending to every grand j ury in Ireland
</p>
<p>exclusive of the grand jury of the Court of Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench. Their lordships would observe that there
</p>
<p>was no dispute on that subject, and if the 56th
</p>
<p>Geo. III. and 1 and 2 Vic. were both out of the
</p>
<p>way, the EngUsh authorities would at once bear
</p>
<p>upon the case. But it was contended at the other
</p>
<p>side, and by the case made in this plea in abate-
</p>
<p>ment, that the witnesses should be sworn in that
</p>
<p>court notwithstanding the direction to the contrary
</p>
<p>given by Judge Burton in charging the grand jury.
</p>
<p>Their case was that the witnesses should be sworn
</p>
<p>in court before the officer of the court under the

<p>provisions of the 5Cth Geo. III., the statute re-
</p>
<p>ferred to by the plea, and, therefore, the court
</p>
<p>would observe that there was no question, and he
</p>
<p>would wish their lordships to bear in mind that
</p>
<p>there was no question, as to its being a general pro-
</p>
<p>vision extending to every court and grand jm-y
</p>
<p>throughout Ireland, and that it was an act passed
</p>
<p>as already stated with the object of removing the
</p>
<p>mischief that was supposed or felt to exist from
</p>
<p>finding bills of indictment in the mere sworn infor-
</p>
<p>mations without a viva voce examination, and the
</p>
<p>object and intent of the legislature was to substi-
</p>
<p>tute that viva voce examination at all events to a
</p>
<p>certain extent. That statute, which, as he had al-
</p>
<p>ready stated, extended to every part of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>which was general in its provisions, not excluding
</p>
<p>any court or grand jury, led to this inconvenience,
</p>
<p>that the proceeding particularly of the Courts of
</p>
<p>Oyer and Termmer throughout the country were
</p>
<p>hiterrupted by swearing the witnesses in court, and
</p>
<p>it was considered better to administer the oath to
</p>
<p>them in the grand jm-y room, there being twelve of
</p>
<p>the jurors present, than amidst the noise of a
</p>
<p>crowded court. That inconvenience had been ad-
</p>
<p>verted to by Cliief Justice Doherty in th.e Hilary
</p>
<p>sittings in 1839 ; he said that it led to an irrevereiid
</p>
<p>administration of the oath. The object of the 1st
</p>
<p>and 2d Victoi'ia was to avoid that mischief in every
</p>
<p>Court of Oyer and Terminer, and in none of them
</p>
<p>would the proceedings be more seriously inter-
</p>
<p>rupted than in the Court of Queen's Bench if many
</p>
<p>bills were sent up to the grand jury. It was to
</p>
<p>remedy the mischief arising from the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of the oath in court, but still carrying out, and

<p>their nature, and referable to grand juries, as the

<p>previous to the examination of any witness whose

<p>any bill of indictment, administer to such witness

<p>the oath or (in case of persons by law pei-mitted to

<p>ness or witnesses as shall have been duly sworn, or
</p>
<p>shall have made such affirmation before him, and au-
</p>
<p>thenticate the same by his signature or initials ;" and
</p>
<p>then came the two provisions which were of consider-
</p>
<p>able importance, and to which he begged the attention
</p>
<p>of the court. " Provided always that the said oath, or
</p>
<p>affirmation, is not to be in addition to, but in lien of
</p>
<p>that heretofore administered in court under the pro-
</p>
<p>visions of the said act passed in the 56th year of the
</p>
<p>reign of his late Majesty King George III." Now
</p>
<p>he would ask the court, looking to that proviso, and
</p>
<p>to the preamble, which was general in its nature,
</p>
<p>and looking to the undoubted fact of the 36th
</p>
<p>George III. being applicable to every grand jury
</p>
<p>throughout Ireland, was it not plain and palpable to
</p>
<p>the commonest and dullest understanding, that the
</p>
<p>object of the act of parliament was this, to leave
</p>
<p>that untouched which was found to be beneficial
</p>
<p>under the 56th George III. namely, the viva voce
</p>
<p>examination of witnesses, and to apply a remedy to
</p>
<p>that which was not found to work well, the mode of
</p>
<p>administering the oath. But there followed another

<p>proviso that was equally strong, " and provided also

<p>Beports, 511. In all those cases the same principle
</p>
<p>had been laid down as was laid down by the Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice. He did not concede that in this case
</p>
<p>it was necessary to go the lengths which the court
</p>
<p>had been called upon to go in the cases to which he
</p>
<p>referred, or to construe the act of parliament against
</p>
<p>its letter, but he referred to those cases to show
</p>
<p>that the court had construed acts even against their
</p>
<p>letter in order to carry out what it was palpable
</p>
<p>were the intentions of the legislature. There were
</p>
<p>two or three older cases to which he begged to refer.
</p>
<p>The first case to which he would call th attention
</p>
<p>of the court was in 2nd Institute, p. 395, and was a
</p>
<p>comnxentary upon the statute of Westminster the
</p>
<p>2nd. The next case to which he would call their
</p>
<p>attention was in page 393 of the same book, 2nd
</p>
<p>Institute ; and Lord Coke, in commenting upon
</p>
<p>another passage of the same act of parliament which
</p>
<p>gave jurisdiction in term to Justices of Eyre, said,
</p>
<p>that although Justices in Eyre were particularly
</p>
<p>mentioned, yet it doth extend to the Court of Com-
</p>
<p>mon Pleas. He next referred to the 2nd Institute,
</p>
<p>page 256, which referred to the mischief which,
</p>
<p>under particular circumstances, might arise.

<p>the present governed acts of parliament of that kind
</p>
<p> if the intentions of the legislature were beyond
</p>
<p>doubt and beyond question as appearing upon the
</p>
<p>preamble of the act, keeping always in view that
</p>
<p>the 56th George III. was admittedly general in its
</p>
<p>nature and enactments and applied to all cases, what
</p>
<p>he contended was for this, that looking to the title
</p>
<p>and preamble and to both the provisoes, the clauses
</p>
<p>of the section, and the general provisions which
</p>
<p>were applicable to all grand juries, and the circum-
</p>
<p>stances of mischief being applicable in aU cases,
</p>
<p>that the duty referred to was not confined to the
</p>
<p>clerk of the crown at assizes. Were they prepared
</p>
<p>to contend that no grand juries within the meaning
</p>
<p>of this act of parhament were referred to except
</p>
<p>the grand juries of courts outside the county and
</p>
<p>city of Dublin, because if the act were inappUcable
</p>
<p>to the Court of Queen's Bench, it was just as inap-
</p>
<p>plicable to Courts of Commission held in Green-
</p>
<p>street. He would ask the court this, when the
</p>
<p>judges went down to hold the Commission of Oyer
</p>
<p>and Terminer, or to hold a special commission in
</p>
<p>the country, was it ever thought of swearing the
</p>
<p>witnesses in open court ? He was satisfied his argu-
</p>
<p>ment was clear to the court, and that he had shown
</p>
<p>it to be the intention of the legislature that it was
</p>
<p>not to be confined to any particular grand jury, and
</p>
<p>the ministerial act to be done was to be done by the
</p>
<p>officer of the court. If a narrow construction was
</p>
<p>put upon the act, it was to be put upon every brancli
</p>
<p>of the act of parliament, the clerk of the peace was
</p>
<p>to do the duty at quarter sessions. Now the Re-
</p>
<p>corder of Cork sat every six weeks, and was every

<p>act that he did to be illegal, because he did not sit

</p>
<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>minal eourts were referred to in 2d Gabbett's Crimi-
</p>
<p>nal Law, 321. As to the inartificial mode in whicli
</p>
<p>the plea had been prepared, he had to add, that they
</p>
<p>had in that dilatory plea omitted to state that the
</p>
<p>witnesses had not been affirmed in court, as they
</p>
<p>might have been. He mentioned that, merely to
</p>
<p>Bhow that in point of form it was as untenable as it
</p>
<p>was illegal in point of law. In eight out of nine
</p>
<p>pleas they did not state the names of the traversers
</p>
<p>in the beginning, and he had taken up the other
</p>
<p>plea because the name Daniel O'Connell appeared in
</p>
<p>it. Under these circumstances, and without going
</p>
<p>further into the objections against the form of the
</p>
<p>plea, he submitted that, according to the policy of
</p>
<p>the legislature, he had put a proper construction on
</p>
<p>the act of parliameut, whereas the court were called
</p>
<p>by the opposite side to put a most narrow construc-
</p>
<p>tion on the statute, calculated to defeat the object
</p>
<p>of the legislature. He trusted, therefore, that the
</p>
<p>court would have no difficulty in allowing the de-
</p>
<p>murrer which the crown had taken in that case.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen said in that case lie ap-
</p>
<p>peared on behalf of the traversers, and he could
</p>
<p>assure their lordships that he never rose to address
</p>
<p>the court with feelings of greater embarrassment
</p>
<p>and responsibility than at that moment, because he
</p>
<p>could not disguise from himself that matters of vast
</p>
<p>importance rested upon the impression he should be
</p>
<p>able to make upon the court. Before going into the
</p>
<p>case he wished to observe that it had been alleged
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General, upon a former occasion,
</p>
<p>in reference to the plea now at argument, that it had
</p>
<p>been intended for purposes of delay, but he thought
</p>
<p>their lordships would agree with him, that though,

</p>
<p>technically speaking, it might be considered to be a
</p>
<p>dilatory plea, still that the question raised by it was
</p>
<p>of the most serious importance, and one which per-
</p>
<p>fectly justified the traversers putting that plea upon
</p>
<p>record, in order to have the necessary decision
</p>
<p>passed upon the matter by the ultimate tribunal.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General began his argument by re-
</p>
<p>ferring their lordships to what had occurred at the
</p>
<p>C!onmiission Court in Dublin after the passing of
</p>
<p>the statute, and in a subsequent part of his argu-
</p>
<p>ment he referred to the practice at the special com-
</p>
<p>missions, a few of which had taken place since the
</p>
<p>act came in force. But if ever there was a case in
</p>
<p>which practice ought not to rule the decision of their
</p>
<p>lordships it was the present. In matters of mere
</p>
<p>form the rules and practice of the court were an in-
</p>
<p>valuable guide, but where the question involved was
</p>
<p>a.matter of law, he would respectfully submit that
</p>
<p>practice ought not to be taken as a guide by the
</p>
<p>court in coming to their decision. In support of that
</p>
<p>observation he would refer their lordships to a very
</p>
<p>strong authority which was to be found in 3d Term
</p>
<p>Eeports, 725. After reading the opinion of Lord
</p>
<p>Kenyon in that authority, he proceeded to say tliat
</p>
<p>it was no matter how often an error might have been
</p>
<p>committed by witnesses being sworn before grand
</p>
<p>juries, and not in open court, still if the law did not
</p>
<p>allow such a course to be taken it should not be con-
</p>
<p>tinued, no matter how long the practice might have
</p>
<p>existed. Having said so much as to the practice
</p>
<p>contended for by the Attorney-General, he would
</p>
<p>next come to consider the other parts of the argu-
</p>
<p>ment which he had put forward. The Attorney-
</p>
<p>General had cited some cases, not, however, very

</p>
<p>S3
</p>
<p>on the bill by the clerk of the ctottii at the assizes,
</p>
<p>or by the clerk of the peace at the sessions. The
</p>
<p>first question that arose on the construction of tlie
</p>
<p>statute was, could the word assizes mean Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench, for if it could, then be admitted there was
</p>
<p>an end to the case, and that the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>was entitled to have judgment on the demurrer.
</p>
<p>According to 3d Blackstone's Commentaries, 185,
</p>
<p>the word "assize," or "assise," signifies originally
</p>
<p>the jury who try a cause, and sit together tor that
</p>
<p>purpose, and the word retains its original significa-
</p>
<p>tion in the Scottish law to the present day. In the
</p>
<p>English law, however, its original signification Avas
</p>
<p>lost at an early period, but the word was retained in
</p>
<p>connection with a form of action now abolished,
</p>
<p>which was made use of for the recovery of lauds.
</p>
<p>The history of that action he might observe was to
</p>
<p>be found in 3d Blackstone's Commentaries, p. 184,
</p>
<p>and 1st Reeves, English Law, pp. 178, 244. By the
</p>
<p>common law " assizes" were taken only in the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench and Common Pleas, and before Jus-
</p>
<p>tices in Eyre, who were appointed in the reign of
</p>
<p>Henry IL, to go round the kingdom once every seven
</p>
<p>years to take these assizes. By Matjna Charta, how-
</p>
<p>ever, that practice was altered, and justices were
</p>
<p>appointed to go once every year to take the assizes.
</p>
<p>This latter arrangement was found to be attended
</p>
<p>Avith many advantages, and in the reign of Edward
</p>
<p>I. it was further improved. By the statute of West-
</p>
<p>minster, 13th Edward I., it was directed that two
</p>
<p>justices should go into each county at most three
</p>
<p>times in the year, to take assizes. By the same
</p>
<p>statute a commission of Nisi Prius was directed to be
</p>
<p>granted to them, as also commission of Oyer and

<p>Terminer, and of gaol delivery, in order tliat they
</p>
<p>might try all civil cases, and dehver the gaols. The
</p>
<p>courts which these judges held was technically
</p>
<p>called the assizes. By the 3d Edward IV.. chap.
</p>
<p>5  an Irish act  similar provisions were established
</p>
<p>in Ireland, and certain justices were assigned to take
</p>
<p>the assizes of Mart Daucestor aud Novel desseisin, and
</p>
<p>to deliver. the gaols in all the counties of Ireland,
</p>
<p>and that was the origin of what in Ireland was now
</p>
<p>called the " assizes." In 3d Blackstone's Commen-
</p>
<p>taries, 185, "assizes" were defined to be "The
</p>
<p>judicial assemblies held by the King's commission
</p>
<p>in every county, as well to take writs of assize as to
</p>
<p>try causes at nisi prius," and in 2nd Gabbett's Cri-
</p>
<p>minal Law, page 8, he found the following passage :
</p>
<p>"Ireland hai been since 1796, divided into six cir-
</p>
<p>cuits, and the courts held in any county, county of
</p>
<p>a city, or county of a town, on these circuits for the
</p>
<p>trial of civil as well as criminal business is called
</p>
<p>the ' assize.' " The court would perceive from those
</p>
<p>definitions, that it clearly appeared that whatever
</p>
<p>might have been the original meaning of the term
</p>
<p>" assizes," yet it had acquired in time a spe-
</p>
<p>cific technical meaning, aud that' the Court of
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench was not, properly speaking, a court
</p>
<p>of assize. Now in the case of Smith v. Harman, 6th
</p>
<p>Modern, 143, it was laid down, that " if a statute
</p>
<p>made use of a word, the meaning of which is well
</p>
<p>known, and has a certain definite place at the com-
</p>
<p>mon law, the word shall be expounded and received
</p>
<p>in the same sense in which it is understood at the
</p>
<p>. common law;" and thus the term "cottages," which
</p>
<p>is used in the act of 31st Elizabeth, chap. 7, h.as the
</p>
<p>same signification there as it had at the common

<p>and sufficient to include them, and secondly, because
</p>
<p>they fell -wdtliin the policy of the act. But before
</p>
<p>adverting to the wording of the act, he thought it
</p>
<p>right to remark that the statute ought to be con-
</p>
<p>strued strictly, fii-st, because it was a penal statute,
</p>
<p>and contrary to the modern policy of legislature,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it deprived the accused of the means of
</p>
<p>knowing the names of his accusers ; secondly, be-
</p>
<p>cause it took away the common-law right, and cre-
</p>
<p>ated a new jurisdiction. Statutes of that descrip-
</p>
<p>tion were never to have an equitable construction.
</p>
<p>By the 56th Geo. III., the witnesses were obliged to
</p>

</p>
<p>the means of knowing who their accusers were ; but
</p>
<p>the 1st and 2nd Vic. "took away that right, and by
</p>
<p>the practice of that court, which their lordships had
</p>
<p>decided to be the law iu Ireland, the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses on the back of the indictment could not
</p>
<p>now be given. The modern poUcy of the legislature
</p>
<p>was, as is well known, to give the traversers and
</p>
<p>prisoners the greatest facilities for preparing for
</p>
<p>their defence, and therefore it was that copies of the
</p>
<p>informations were granted to the parties accused,
</p>
<p>and that act, as he had already mentioned, was at
</p>
<p>variance with that poUcy, and it ought therefore to
</p>
<p>be construed strictly. There was also another rea-
</p>
<p>son why it should be held not to apply to the Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench, and that was, that in a mere enacting law,
</p>
<p>the Queen's Bench (and consequently its grand ju-
</p>
<p>ries) was not as in a general rule included, unless
</p>
<p>it were expressly named in the enactment. Tliat
</p>
<p>principle had been laid down hy the court in Fos-

<p>act of parliament, yet in many cases tbey shall not
</p>
<p>bind the Queen's Bench, because the pleas there are
</p>
<p>coram ipso rege." In tlie second Hawkins, chap. 27,
</p>
<p>Sec. 124, it was said " where a statute (8th Henry
</p>
<p>VI., chap. 10,) speaks of indictments to be taken
</p>
<p>before justices of the peace or others having power
</p>
<p>to take indictments, it shall not include indictments
</p>
<p>taken in the Queen's Bench." That principle had
</p>
<p>been acted on in modern times, and he found a
</p>
<p>strong case on the subject in 8th Barnwell and Cress-
</p>
<p>well, 420  the King v. Richards and others. The
</p>
<p>case of the King v. Kelsey, 18th Bowling's Practice
</p>
<p>Cases, 481 , was an argument for the same point. The
</p>
<p>act ought to be construed striotlj'. First, because
</p>
<p>it was a penal statute. Secondly, because it took
</p>
<p>away the common law right from tlie defendant ;
</p>
<p>and third, because the Queen's Bench was not in-
</p>
<p>cluded in enacting statutes, unless it was expressly
</p>
<p>mentioned. It was true that the Queen's Bench
</p>
<p>was included in the 56th George III., chap. 87, but
</p>
<p>that was on a declaration, as well as an enacting
</p>
<p>statute, and the Queen's Bench was, therefore, in-
</p>
<p>cluded iu it, because it was included iu aU declara-
</p>
<p>tory acts, though not in enacting statutes. He liad
</p>
<p>next to see if there was anything in that act of the
</p>
<p>1st and 2nd Victoria to take it out of the general
</p>
<p>rule. It was indeed asserted that the title of it was
</p>
<p>general, but there was no principle better estabhshed
</p>
<p>than that the .title was no part of the statute. That
</p>
<p>was laid down iu the case of the King v, Williams,
</p>
<p>1st Blackstone, 95, and by a very eminent judge,
</p>
<p>Lord Mansfield, in Dwarris, 153, where he stated
</p>
<p>that "tlie custom of prefixing titles to statutes did
</p>
<p>not begin till the 11th year of the reign of King

</p>
<p>would put it to the coiii't, did not this in substance
</p>
<p>amount to a clear and manifest declaration that tlie
</p>
<p>legislature had not the Queen's Bench in their view
</p>
<p>at the time they passed the act, and that it was their
</p>
<p>clear intention to confine the application of the gene-
</p>
<p>ral words which were used in the commencement of
</p>
<p>the act exclusively to assizes and quarter sessions ?
</p>
<p>The legislature never had the Court of Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench in their contemplation when they were fram-
</p>
<p>ing the 1st and 2nd of Victoria, cap. 37, for as they
</p>
<p>deemed it expedient and advisable to define the
</p>
<p>morfiis opeiandi in the one case, they clearly would
</p>
<p>have considered themselves bound to do so in the
</p>
<p>other case also if it had ever been the design or ob-
</p>
<p>ject of the framers of that act that it should have re-
</p>
<p>ference to the Court of Queen's Bench. The words
</p>
<p>of the statute were that " in all cases where bills of
</p>
<p>indictment were to be laid before grand juries in
</p>
<p>Ireland for their consideration, the clerk of the
</p>
<p>crown at assizes, and tlie clerk of the peace at quar-
</p>
<p>ter sessions, or his or their deputy, shall endorse
</p>
<p>upon the hack of each bill of indictment the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses for the crown;" and he contended
</p>
<p>that having regard to the context of the entire act,
</p>
<p>and taking into consideration the manifest intention
</p>
<p>of the legislature in introducing that act, it was
</p>
<p>clearly obvious that the framers of the statute in-
</p>
<p>tended that the words " in all cases" should be con-
</p>
<p>strued as meaning all cases, i. e. all crimes in courts
</p>
<p>of assize and quarter sessions. If the wording of
</p>
<p>the statute ran specifically thus  " Be it enacted,

<p>the clerk of the crown at the assizes, and the clerlt
</p>
<p>of the peace at quarter sessions, and by no otlier
</p>
<p>person," could any one have a doubt, hut that the
</p>
<p>words " grand juries in Ireland" would mean grand
</p>
<p>juries at assizes and sessions in Ireland ? But it
</p>
<p>would be said that that was not the wording of the
</p>
<p>section, and that the statute in the present instance
</p>
<p>was not imperative, but merely directory. This
</p>
<p>however, was a line of argument that could not be
</p>
<p>sustaiued, for the rule was quite settled that if an
</p>
<p>affirmative statute which is introductory of a new
</p>
<p>law, direct a new tiling to be done in a certain man-
</p>
<p>ner, that even in the absence from the statute of any
</p>
<p>negative words (such as those he had imagined to
</p>
<p>be supplied), it shall not, and cannot be done in any
</p>
<p>other manner. Tliis he maintained was a legal pro-
</p>
<p>position which it was impossible to gainsay, and
</p>
<p>the doctrine would be found expressly laid down and
</p>
<p>acknowledged in Wethen v. Baldwin, first Siderfin,
</p>
<p>page 56. So, too, if a new power be given by an
</p>
<p>affirmative statute to a certain person by the de-
</p>
<p>signation of that one person, all other persons are
</p>
<p>excluded from it for inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.
</p>
<p>Thus in Shadley's case, reported in Plowden's Com-
</p>
<p>mentaries, p. 206, it was held that when the statute
</p>
<p>31 Edw. III., cap. 12, enacts that error in the Ex-
</p>
<p>chequer shall be amended and corrected before the
</p>
<p>chancellor and treasurer, that it cannot be amended
</p>
<p>by any other ; and a case was cited out of Dallisou's
</p>
<p>Reports that forasmuch as the statute of 6th Henry
</p>
<p>VIII., cap. 9, of forcible entry, designeth justices of
</p>
<p>the peace to make restitution thereby (although the
</p>
<p>statute be in the affirmative), others are excluded ;
</p>
<p>and therefore, neither justices of Oyer and Termi-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>could not fairly afiord a key to the construction of
</p>
<p>an act of parliament; for the fact was notorious,
</p>
<p>that the preamble wp.s no part of the statute. (Coun-
</p>
<p>sel cited several cases in support of tliis motion, and
</p>
<p>amongst others the case of Willis v. Wilkins, 6 Mo-
</p>
<p>dern, &>.) The preamble might occasionally explain
</p>
<p>and restrain, but it could never amjjlify the powers
</p>
<p>of an act. In the present case the preamble con-
</p>
<p>sisted of three distinct parts. First, it recited the
</p>
<p>benefit to have accrued from it ; secondlj', the
</p>
<p>benefit which had accrued from it ; and thirdly, the
</p>
<p>inconvenience to which it had given rise. Now, no
</p>
<p>doubt the last recital was very general, but in many
</p>
<p>cases it happened that the preambles of statutes,
</p>
<p>when they recited the mischief for which a remedy
</p>
<p>was intended, were more extensive than the enacting
</p>
<p>part of the statute. (Counsel referred to the deci-
</p>
<p>sion in the case of the King t>. Powell, Fourth Term
</p>
<p>Reports, page 376, in support of his argument.) But
</p>
<p>even though the question for consideration was this,
</p>
<p>whether the particular case now under discussion
</p>
<p>wa^ or was not within the mischief which it was the
</p>
<p>object of the act of Victoria to remedy, even upon
</p>
<p>these grounds he contended that the act referred to
</p>
<p>could never have been designed to refer to the term
</p>
<p>grand juries. Let them consider what the mischief
</p>
<p>was and when it existed that rendered it advisa-
</p>
<p>ble to introduce the new act, and even upon this
</p>
<p>showing the case was with him. Prosecutions but
</p>
<p>seldom were instituted in the Queen's Bench, and
</p>
<p>therefore the mischief in that court was but small.
</p>
<p>At assizes and sessions, however, the mischief was
</p>
<p>of every-day occurrence, and that most probably
</p>
<p>was what the legislature had it in contemplation to

</p>
<p>remedy. Indeed, that this was the case would ap-
</p>
<p>pear from the statute itself, and it was not competent
</p>
<p>for their lordships to strain a point for the purpose
</p>
<p>of making an act apply by what was called in law
</p>
<p>" an equitable construction" to anything to which
</p>
<p>it was not designed by the legislature originally that
</p>
<p>it should have application. It was a maxim in law
</p>
<p>wliich it was not possible to controvert, that if the
</p>
<p>words of a statute do not reach to an inconvenience
</p>
<p>rarely happening, they will not be extended to it by
</p>
<p>an equitable construction, for the objects of a reme-
</p>
<p>dial statute are mischiefs qua frequenter accident. It
</p>
<p>is good reason in such case, ' therefore, and sound
</p>
<p>discretion, not to strain the words further than they
</p>
<p>reach, but the case is to be considered as a castis omis-
</p>
<p>sus. But no matter what might be the mischief con-
</p>
<p>templated by the act, the court was bound to inquire
</p>
<p>what was the remedy that had been provided, and
</p>
<p>that remedy was to be gathered from the act itself
</p>
<p>The true meaning of a statute was to be sought not
</p>
<p>from the title  not from the preamble, but from the
</p>
<p>body of the act. It mattered not how general might
</p>
<p>be the title or preamble, if the body of tlie act if
</p>
<p>the words of the enacting part of it be not equally
</p>
<p>general, the court was bound to give efiect to the
</p>
<p>latter, and not to the former  for it was in the latter,
</p>
<p>that the intention of the legislature was most clearly
</p>
<p>stated and most unequivocally defined. Tlie words
</p>
<p>of the act were that " in all cases where bills of in-

</p>

<p>cows omissus. This doctrine had received the sanc-
</p>
<p>tion of the highest legal authorities, and Mr. Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Buller, in the case of Jones i>. Smyth, First
</p>
<p>Term Reports 52, had expressly laid it down that
</p>
<p>the coui't was bound to take acts of paaliament as
</p>
<p>they found them ; and that it was not admiasiUe that
</p>
<p>they should take upon them to supply a casus omhsvs,
</p>
<p>for that by doing so, they would be departing from
</p>
<p>the legitimate sphere of their duty, and would be
</p>
<p>making laws instead of administering tliem. The
</p>
<p>learned Attorney-General had dwelt with much
</p>
<p>force upou the probable consequences that would
</p>
<p>result from a decision adverse to liim upon the pre-
</p>
<p>sent point, and had directed their lordships' atten-
</p>
<p>tion to this fact, that if the plea in abatement now
</p>
<p>under discussion were deemed to be valid by the
</p>
<p>court, aU convictions which had been had under in-
</p>
<p>dictments liable to the same objection as the present
</p>
<p>indictment must be regarded us illegal convictions,
</p>
<p>and that countless prisonei's had sutiered death or
</p>
<p>were now under sentence of transportation on in-
</p>
<p>dictments which were invalid hi pomt of law. This
</p>
<p>inference had been ingeniously brought under the
</p>
<p>consideration of the court, but he (Sir Colman
</p>
<p>O'Loghlen) respectfully maintained, that the court
</p>
<p>were not at all justified in taking consequences into
</p>
<p>their consideration. They had notliing to do with
</p>
<p>consequences. They were called upon to give their
</p>
<p>decision upou the law of the case, and their decision
</p>
<p>was not to be controlled by any reference to possible
</p>
<p>events, nor could possible events at all alter the le-
</p>
<p>gal complexion of the question. If it be contended

<p>that it was a defect in the act of parliament that it

<p>did not contain any allusion to the Queen's Bench,

<p>the circumstance was perhaps to be regretted, but
</p>
<p>the construction of the law was not to be altered in
</p>
<p>that court. It was the legislature alone that could
</p>
<p>do that, and if their lordships were of opinion that
</p>
<p>the omission was indeed a serious one, and one that
</p>
<p>was to be regretted, he was sure the leajued Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General, who was himself a member of the
</p>
<p>legislature, would have much pleasure in intro-
</p>
<p>ducing next session a bill for the remedy of the
</p>
<p>defect. 'ihe learned gentleman had objected
</p>
<p>to the manner in which these pleas of abatement
</p>
<p>had been drawn up. He had declared that they
</p>
<p>were inartificial in the mode in which they were
</p>
<p>framed, and he founded his objection upon this
</p>
<p>ground amongst others, t-bat the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were not mentiontd in them; but he could
</p>
<p>not help saying, that in his opinion such an objec-
</p>
<p>tion as this came with peciUiarly bad grace from the
</p>
<p>learned Attorney-General, after all that had oc-
</p>
<p>curred, and tTiat even within the judicial knowledge

<p>of their lordships.

<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen said that if the learned

<p>press tenns, it Avas at all events clearly conveyed in
</p>
<p>the special grounds of demurrer, for one of those
</p>
<p>grounds was that the plea did not contain the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses, or in the absence of the names did
</p>
<p>not contain a statement to the etfect that the wit-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>died the question. He (Mr. M.) was not at all san-
</p>
<p>guine as to his capability of adding anytWng of
</p>
<p>much importance to -what had already fallen from
</p>
<p>his talented friend, nor would he have run the risk
</p>
<p>of impairing the effect of so eloquent an address,
</p>
<p>were it not tliat he felt that the case was one of no
</p>
<p>ordiaary importance, and for this reason he would
</p>
<p>take the hberty of explaining to their lordships, as
</p>
<p>briefly as possible, the views which occurred to him
</p>
<p>upon the subject. It was, in every sense of the
</p>
<p>word, a case of the deepest importance, and he
</p>
<p>therefore tliought it his duty, even at the risk of
</p>
<p>breaking the effect of Sir Colman OXoghlen's admi-
</p>
<p>rable observations, to submit to the court wliat his
</p>
<p>opinions were in reference to it. The Attoruey-
</p>
<p>General had, on the present occasion, adopted just
</p>
<p>such a course as from liis long knowledge and expe-
</p>
<p>rience of tliat gentleman he was led to expect he
</p>
<p>would have pursued  he had boldly come to the
</p>
<p>consideration of the main question in the case, de-
</p>
<p>claring with frankness that he would have deemed
</p>
<p>himself guilty of a gross dereliction of public duty if
</p>
<p>he had not at once grappled with tlie point, as it
</p>
<p>arose out of the construction of the act. The learned
</p>
<p>Attorney-General had made only a slight and cur-
</p>
<p>sory objection to what he regarded as informalities
</p>
<p>in tiie pleas. He evidently considered tlieni as mat-
</p>
<p>ters of very secondary importance, and their lord-
</p>
<p>ships, he was sure, would regard them in a similar
</p>
<p>light ; nor would the court, even though there were
</p>
<p>a thousand such trivial informalities, shrink on ac-
</p>
<p>count of their existence from expressing decisively
</p>
<p>their opinion upon the construction of the statute
</p>
<p>which was now brought under their consideration.

<p>The Attorney-General had enlarged with much force
</p>
<p>of language upon tlie disastrous consequences wliich
</p>
<p>would probably result, if the court were to decide
</p>
<p>the point adverse to Iiim ; but no consideration of
</p>
<p>possible contingencies could alter the actual state of
</p>
<p>the law in tliis regard, and the arguments of his
</p>
<p>learned friend only went to show that it was of tlie
</p>
<p>last moment that the case be decided one way or tlie
</p>
<p>other. If the proper construction of the act be tliat
</p>
<p>which he (counsel) contended for, it was right that
</p>
<p>an act of the legislature should be introduced with
</p>
<p>the least possible delay, to prevent further injury ;
</p>
<p>but if, on the contrary, the true construction was
</p>
<p>that for which the crown contended, it was right
</p>
<p>that they should have their lordships' decision to
</p>
<p>that effect, which would for ever put the question
</p>
<p>beyond controversy. He trusted, therefore, that the
</p>
<p>court would give their decision upon this interesting
</p>
<p>question, utterly regardless of the informalities in
</p>
<p>the plea  if any such informalities did indeed exist.
</p>
<p>It had been asserted on the other side that in some
</p>
<p>places it had been the common-law practice in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, and particularly in Durham, for the grand
</p>
<p>jury to administer an oath to witnesses without any
</p>
<p>act of parliament authorising them so to do ; but,
</p>
<p>without stopping to inquire whether there were any
</p>
<p>circumstances in the case which would nominally
</p>
<p>explain or excuse so anomalous a practice, he would
</p>
<p>take the liberty to say, that if the grand jury pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to find bills on evidence not duly and legally
</p>
<p>sworn before tliem, they had indulged in a practice
</p>
<p>which, in his humble judgment, was neither consti-
</p>
<p>tutional nor legal. His learned friend, the Attorney -
</p>

</p>
<p>O'Loghlen, who showed how little importance was
</p>
<p>to be attached to the title of an act. But even
</p>
<p>though it were important, he denied that the title in
</p>
<p>the present instance carried such authority as the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General claimed for it. For what was the
</p>
<p>title of the act? It was entitled, an act to empower
</p>
<p>the foreman, or any other member of grand juries
</p>
<p>in Ireland, to administer oaths to witnesses on bills
</p>
<p>of indictment. There were undoubtedly some grand
</p>
<p>juries in Ireland to which that title applied, but it
</p>
<p>did not apply to all, else what could have been more
</p>
<p>easy than to have written " an act to empower the
</p>
<p>foreman of all grand juries in Ireland, &c. &c." 
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General maintained that the pream-
</p>
<p>ble being general, ought to afford a clue to tlie in-
</p>
<p>terpretation of the entire act, but he (Mr. Moore)
</p>
<p>denied that any such importance was to be attached
</p>
<p>to the preambles of acts of parliament. Let tliem
</p>
<p>rather study the intentions and objects of the legis-
</p>
<p>lature. What was the mischief which it was design-
</p>
<p>ed to remedy, and where did it exist ? Was it not a
</p>
<p>partial mischief, and wherefore then should general
</p>
<p>interpretation be attached to the act having refer-
</p>
<p>ence to it ? The act was introduced to remedy the
</p>
<p>delay and inconvenience of the old system, but
</p>
<p>where was that delay and inconvenience found to

<p>where the criminal prosecutions were exceedingly

<p>in the interval which elapsed between the pass-

<p>nience had occurred. It was plain, therefore, that
</p>
<p>the legislature could not have had the Queen's Bench
</p>
<p>in contemplation. Taking into consideration the
</p>
<p>obvious intentions of the government, and having
</p>
<p>regard to the whole context of the act, nothing
</p>
<p>could be more rational and natural than the inters
</p>
<p>pretation which Sir Colman O'Loglilen put upon
</p>
<p>the words, " in all cases where bills of indictment
</p>
<p>are to be sent before grand juries, &c.," reading it
</p>
<p>as though it meant all cases in the courts of assizes
</p>
<p>and quarter sessions. He asked would it be com-
</p>
<p>petent for a grand jury to examine a witness whose
</p>
<p>name did not appear on the bill, and as Sir Colman
</p>
<p>O'Loghlen had put it, could they support a prose-
</p>
<p>cution for perjury if such a witness were examined
</p>
<p>and were to swear falsely ? Should they not say in
</p>
<p>the indictment that his name had appeared on the
</p>
<p>back of the bill ? It followed clearly and distinctly
</p>
<p>that the authority given to the foreman of a grand
</p>
<p>jury to administer an oath was not an act done by
</p>
<p>an officer specially entitled by an act of parliament,
</p>
<p>but that it was the machinery by which the legis-
</p>
<p>lature thought fit to mark out the remedy intended
</p>
<p>by that act of parliament. The language of the act
</p>
<p>was, that at the sessions or assizes the officer was
</p>
<p>to give authority to the foreman of the jury to ad-
</p>
<p>minister the oath. But he would ask his learned
</p>
<p>friend the Attorney-General, suppose the words
</p>
<p>" clerk of the crown at the assizes" were omitted,
</p>
<p>and that the sentence ran thus:  " that in all cases
</p>
<p>where bills were laid for the consideration of the
</p>
<p>grand jury, the clerk of the peace and his deputy
</p>
<p>were to endorse the names of the witnesses," would
</p>
<p>it then be held that the act applied to every possible

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>came \rithm the same tignification as the assizes,
</p>
<p>but if they did not, he, without hesitation, would
</p>
<p>say, that they were not included in the provisions
</p>
<p>of that act. He then proceeded to argue that the
</p>
<p>grand juries mentioned in the act, only iucluded
</p>
<p>the grand juries of the assizes and of the sessions,
</p>
<p>as it was to these only that the clerk of the crown
</p>
<p>and the clerk of the peace were to send up the bills
</p>
<p>of indictment. Tlie clerk of the crown at the
</p>
<p>assizes could not send a bill to the grand jury of the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench, and tlie clerk of the peace at quar-
</p>
<p>ter sessions could not send up a bill before the grand
</p>
<p>jury at the assizes.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton inquired what he would say to
</p>
<p>cases at special commissions to the country not at
</p>
<p>the lime of assizes ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he thought they were included in
</p>
<p>the observations he had applied with respect to the
</p>
<p>commission court. It would depend on the ques-
</p>
<p>tion whether they did not substantially come under
</p>
<p>the term assizes.'but if they did not, then he would
</p>
<p>exclude them, on the same grounds as he would
</p>
<p>exclude the Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton asked what construction would he
</p>
<p>put on the words in the statute, " so empannelled ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he would consider them to sig-
</p>
<p>nify the grand jury of the assizes of which ho was
</p>
<p>clerk of the crown, or the grand jury of the
</p>
<p>quarter sessions of wliich the officer was clerk of
</p>
<p>the peace.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton said the words " so empan-
</p>
<p>nelled" appeared to him naturally to bring back
</p>
<p>to the first description " all the grand jm-ies in
</p>
<p>Ireland."

<p>Mr. Moore said that would imply that the clerk
</p>
<p>of the crown at the assizes was to send up a bill
</p>
<p>before the grand jury of the Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>Judge CramptonThen the effect of the argu-
</p>
<p>ment would seem to be this, that no officer is em-
</p>
<p>powered to send bills to the grand jury at the as-
</p>
<p>sizes, but the clerk of the crown.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  Or his deputy.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Or his deputy ; or at quarter
</p>
<p>sessions but the clerk of the peace or his deputy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he certainly went that length.
</p>
<p>Suppose an assizes in the county of Loulh which
</p>
<p>was to continue for two days, and that on the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of the first day the clerk of the crown were to
</p>
<p>drop dead, he would ask, with great respect, where
</p>
<p>would be the officer to act in that case, as, even if
</p>
<p>the deceased officer had appointed a deputy, his de-
</p>
<p>putation would end with the death of liis principal?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General argued that the word " as-
</p>
<p>sizes" comprised in it the Court of Queen's Bench,
</p>
<p>but he would venture to assert that there was not
</p>
<p>an individual in the community having the passage
</p>
<p>read to him, who would conceive that it meant the
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench. If he said that a particular person
</p>
<p>was indicted at the assizes, and that he meant by
</p>
<p>that that he had been indicted before the Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench, he would be laughed at. He then proceeded
</p>
<p>to observe, that however desirable it might have
</p>
<p>been for the legislature to have used more emphatic
</p>
<p>language, still it was the duty of the court to deal
</p>
<p>with the words as they found them in the statute ;
</p>
<p>and, in liis humble judgment, the court could not
</p>
<p>give the act of parliament the construction con-
</p>
<p>tended for. After proceeding at some farther length
</p>
<p>THE DEMURRER.
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>the language of the act of parliament, to avoid giving
</p>
<p>it such an interpretation. One of the first duties of
</p>
<p>a court of justice, in interpreting an act of parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, was to further the intention of the legislature,
</p>
<p>when it was clearly discernible hy the act, though
</p>
<p>the legislature might not have adopted words suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently extensive if technically or narrowly con-
</p>
<p>strued to do it. They were bound also to give it a
</p>
<p>construction that would further the objects and re-
</p>
<p>medy the mischief proposed to be remedied by the
</p>
<p>act, and if it were necessary either to add words, to
</p>
<p>omit words, or to strain words, the court would' do
</p>
<p>so for the purpose of promoting those objects. He
</p>
<p>referred their lordships to the following cases to
</p>
<p>show the general rules adopted in the construction
</p>
<p>of acts of parliament, and it was by those general
</p>
<p>rules that their lordships should be guided in their
</p>
<p>decision :  1st vol. Piowden's Commentaries, p. 36 
</p>
<p>2d vol. Commentaries of Plowden, p. 467  and 2d
</p>
<p>Institute, 156. He also referred to Bryan's case, 5
</p>
<p>Term Reports, p. 509, Saunders v. Plumber, Orlando
</p>
<p>Bridgeman's IJeports, and to several authorities
</p>
<p>cited in 1st Saunders, p. 217. Also, Johns v. Johns,
</p>
<p>3d Dowes' Parliamentary Reports, p. 15, and to
</p>
<p>another case in 2d Institute, p. 33. It being per-
</p>
<p>fectly obvious to his judgment, that upou those au-
</p>
<p>thorities, and upon this principle, their lordships
</p>
<p>were bound to give effect to what upon the whole of
</p>
<p>the act of parliament they would find to be the in-
</p>
<p>tention of the legislature, notwithstanding that that
</p>
<p>may have been incorrectly expressed or imperfectly
</p>
<p>expressed. He would proceed to advert more par-
</p>
<p>ticularly to the subject of the present act of parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, and he hoped to leave no more doubt on the

<p>minds of the court than rested upon his own th.at
</p>
<p>tliis act of Victoria was intended to be a general one
</p>
<p>in its operations, and, in point of law and true con-
</p>
<p>struction, was general in its operations. Let them
</p>
<p>first see what were the words of the 55th Geo. III.,
</p>
<p>which, as they contended, was to apply to the Court
</p>
<p>of Queen's Bench, and it was now conceded and ad-
</p>
<p>mitted, and the foundation of the argument on the
</p>
<p>other side, that that act was universal in its opera-
</p>
<p>tions. There was no court mentioned there, it did
</p>
<p>not mention the Court of Queen's Bench, or assises,
</p>
<p>or the Court of (.)y er and Terminer, but was a gene-
</p>
<p>ral enactment to correct the vicious practice that
</p>
<p>prevailed in Ireland of sending up informations to
</p>
<p>the grand jury, and the grand jury finding bills
</p>
<p>upon them, and no witnesses sworn in support of
</p>
<p>those bills. With respect to an observation of Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore on the argument of the Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>he wished to remark that the Attorney-General did
</p>
<p>not say that the grand jury could not act upon un-
</p>
<p>sworn testimony, but he said that they were sworn
</p>
<p>as at Durham, for instance, before the grand jur}',
</p>
<p>but were not examined without being sworn. In the
</p>
<p>S6th Geo. III. it was recited" Whereas a practice
</p>
<p>hath prevailed, in many of the grand juries in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, to find bills of indictment without examining
</p>
<p>witnesses for the crown ; and it is expedient that
</p>
<p>this practice should for the future be discontinued ;
</p>
<p>be it therefore declared and enacted Ijy the King's
</p>
<p>most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice
</p>
<p>and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal,
</p>
<p>and commons, in this present parliament assembled,

<p>and by the authority of the same, that from and

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>there was a clerk of the crown, and clerk of the
</p>
<p>peace.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General said that the rival construc-
</p>
<p>tions were exactly so ; but he contended for the more
</p>
<p>extensive, and he made bold to say the more rational,
</p>
<p>construction. The act of Victoria had been intro-
</p>
<p>duced to remedy delay, but a false interpretation
</p>
<p>had been put upon that word " delay," whereby it
</p>
<p>was endeavoured to be shown that the mischief
</p>
<p>could have onlj^ existed in a certain description of
</p>
<p>courts. But the mischief wliich it was in reality
</p>
<p>designed to remedy was delay in the proceedings of
</p>
<p>the grand jmy, attributable to the witnesses. The
</p>
<p>witnesses used to be sworn on one day, but several
</p>
<p>days might elapse before the grand jury met, and it
</p>
<p>was to remedy this delay that the act was intro-
</p>
<p>duced. It was also introduced with a view to incul-
</p>
<p>cate a greater reverence for the oath, for when such
</p>
<p>a long time elapsed between the swearing of a wit-
</p>
<p>ness and Ills giving evidence, he was apt to regard
</p>
<p>the obligation of the oath he had taken as less
</p>
<p>solemn and restrictive than it ought to be regarded.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen had talked about a comtmmis
</p>
<p>error, but on behalf of the judges, who regarded tliis
</p>
<p>point in the same light as he did, he repudiated the
</p>
<p>idea that there was any communis error. There were
</p>
<p>high judicial decisions on the point, but nothing
</p>
<p>more. He contended that the words in the act iiav-
</p>
<p>ing reference to the officers of the court were merelj'
</p>
<p>directory, and not imperative.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin But how do you dispose of the

<p>" so empanneUed," meant whenever empanneUed.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin I have been informed Mr. Soli-
</p>
<p>citor-General, though I am not in a position to
</p>
<p>vouch exactly for the truth of the assertion myself,
</p>
<p>that on an occasion when this point was under dis-
</p>
<p>cussion at one of the corumissions, the witnesses
</p>
<p>were sworn both ways. Are you aware of that fact?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General said he was not aware of
</p>
<p>the fact alluded to by his lordsliip, but it was pos-
</p>
<p>sible the thing might have occurred, though he
</p>
<p>found it difficult to reconcile it with the words of
</p>
<p>the act. It seemed to him that an alternative must
</p>
<p>be taken. He then proceeded to observe that they
</p>
<p>had the judicial exposition of the act by the several
</p>
<p>judges who presided at the commission court; but
</p>
<p>even supposing that the practice had prevailed for
</p>
<p>five or six years, sub silentio, which was not the case,
</p>
<p>they should not now alter it. The court were bound
</p>
<p>to give such a construction to a doubtful act of par-
</p>
<p>liament as would show that the judges had not been
</p>
<p>wrong heretofore  that the convictions that had
</p>
<p>taken place for such a period under it had not been
</p>
<p>wrong, and that injustice had not been done by it.
</p>
<p>They should give that construction, even if the
</p>
<p>words were doubtful, which he contended they were
</p>
<p>not. He did not mean to trouble their lordships
</p>
<p>with the other objections taken to the plea, though
</p>
<p>to a purely technical plea technical objections should
</p>
<p>prove fatal. He then referred to Burns' Justice
</p>
<p>Article Abatement 2, and to 2d Barnwell and Cress-
</p>
<p>well, 871. It was said that it came with a very bad
</p>
<p>grace from the Attorney-General to object to the
</p>
<p>plea, because the names of the witnesses had not
</p>
<p>been known, and so it would if the objection had
</p>
<p>THE DEMURREE.
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>nonnced. And to that extent I conceive the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General is warranted in the view he took of the
</p>
<p>act of parliament. I will say that the argument of
</p>
<p>the traversers assumed a very extraordinary sort of
</p>
<p>shape, when having first made the objection that in
</p>
<p>point of time, the practice and usage was not suffi-
</p>
<p>cient, and then boldly and unreservedly announced
</p>
<p>the fact tliat all the judges that had interfered in the
</p>
<p>matter had acted erroneously ; they agreed that,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as all the judges were wrong and in error,
</p>
<p>their common error could not establish the law upon
</p>
<p>the subject. Now certainly, with all respect to the
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I never before heard a counsel who took
</p>
<p>upon himself to say, that all the judges who decided
</p>
<p>against him were in one common error. I conceive
</p>
<p>that the concurrent opinion of those respectable
</p>
<p>judges is one of the highest authority that could be
</p>
<p>produced before us for the direction of our judgment
</p>
<p>upon the present occasion. I, for one, must say
</p>
<p>that I do feel myself very much influenced by the
</p>
<p>authority of these respectable personages when I am
</p>
<p>called upon to form judicially a judgment on the
</p>
<p>same subject, wluch it appears passed under their
</p>
<p>consideration on a previous occasion. I will go now
</p>
<p>to consider the act of parliament. I think it well to
</p>
<p>state certain rules ndth regard to the construction
</p>
<p>of acts of parliament, and how far eminent judges
</p>
<p>upon former and other occasions had felt themselves
</p>
<p>bound to take into consideration the various circum-
</p>
<p>stances that are to be considered, in arriving at a
</p>
<p>just interpretation of an act of parliament, concern-
</p>
<p>ing which there is anj' difficulty whatever. The
</p>
<p>first rule I will mention is a rule laid down by one
</p>
<p>of the most eminent judges who adorned the English

<p>bench, whose authority has been mainly relied upon,
</p>
<p>and insisted upon by Sir Colman O'Loghlen, in his
</p>
<p>argument on this case. I am quite willing to adopt
</p>
<p>the rule as laid down by Lord Tenterden, and to
</p>
<p>bring his opinion to bear upon the question, what is
</p>
<p>to be taken into consideration upon the construction
</p>
<p>of an act of parliament. Lord Tenterden, in 7
</p>
<p>Barnwell and Cresswell, p. 760, in the case of Doe v.
</p>
<p>Brandon, says, " the question in this case depends
</p>
<p>entii'ely upon the construction of a particular act of
</p>
<p>parUament, and, in construing acts of parhament,
</p>
<p>we are to look not only to the langurige of the pre-
</p>
<p>amble, or to any particular clause, but to the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of the whole act, and if we find in the pre-
</p>
<p>amble, or in any particular clause, anj' expression
</p>
<p>not so large and extensive in its import as those used
</p>
<p>in other parts of the act, and upon a view of the
</p>
<p>whole act we can collect from the more large and ex-
</p>
<p>tensive expressions used in other parts, the real in-
</p>
<p>tention of the legislature, it is our duty to give effect
</p>
<p>to the larger and more exteusive expressions, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the phrases of a less extensive import
</p>
<p>in the preamble or in any particular clause." Mow,
</p>
<p>in the progress of the argument of Sir Colman
</p>
<p>O'Loghlen, it was insisted upon in different parts of
</p>
<p>his argument first, that the title of the act was not
</p>
<p>part of the act ; secondly, that the preamble of the
</p>
<p>act was no part of the act. I don't know how he
</p>
<p>would maintain that argument by a reference to the
</p>
<p>authority of Lord Tenterden, whose unquestionable
</p>
<p>authority he does not dispute ; and it is not merely
</p>
<p>the authority of Lord Tenterden, or any other

<p>lord, but it is the authority of common sense, and

<p>dixit of any counsel against the express recital of
</p>
<p>the act of parliament, which does recite that delay
</p>
<p>and other inconvenience resulted fi'om the practice
</p>
<p>of swearing the witnesses in court. I will not go
</p>
<p>beyond that to inquire or listen to counsel asserting
</p>
<p>that, in point of fact, no delay and inconvenience
</p>
<p>can ai'ise, wlien the act of parliament I am bound to
</p>
<p>administer tells nie in express terras, there was, and
</p>
<p>to such an extent that it became necessary to do
</p>
<p>something to meet the evil and to repress the mis-
</p>
<p>chief, and to do that the act of parliament itself was
</p>
<p>passed, and then there Avas, as demonstrated by the
</p>
<p>act of parliament, an evil that existed, of a charac-
</p>
<p>ter so serious as to call for the interposition of the
</p>
<p>legislature. AVhat was that evil, and delay, and incon-
</p>
<p>venience arising out of? Out of the practice of
</p>
<p>witnesses being sworn in court. Now, I would be
</p>
<p>glad to know is that in its nature a mischief, which
</p>
<p>prevails in the country of Ireland at large, but does
</p>
<p>not prevail in the city of Dublin. Tliat was not
</p>
<p>what the legislature contemplated. It contcmpl.ated
</p>
<p>the existence of an evil,which existed in that particu-
</p>
<p>lar way, by delay and other inconvenience, at least as
</p>
<p>much in the city of Dublin asthecountry. Before the
</p>
<p>Commission of Oyer and Terminer, or elsewhere in
</p>
<p>the country, as before any of the assize courts in this
</p>
<p>country, we have as plain as words can make it an
</p>
<p>existing evil, of a general nature, and universal over
</p>
<p>the country  and we h.ave the legislature setliug
</p>
<p>about reforming the evil, wliich they have recited
</p>
<p>to exist. I would be glad to know what reason can
</p>
<p>be suggested for giving tliis act of parliament a con-
</p>
<p>trary construction ? What sort of fatuity is to be

<p>Moore, that is the object of their argument. Well,
</p>
<p>now we will go on with the act of parliament. " For
</p>
<p>remedy whereof be it therefore enacted by the Queen's
</p>
<p>most excellent Majesty, and with the advice of the
</p>
<p>lords spiritual and temporal and commons, and by
</p>
<p>the authority of the same, that in all cases where
</p>
<p>bills of indictment are to be laid before grand juries
</p>
<p>in Ireland for their considcr.ation." There was the
</p>
<p>case that the legislature contemplated, and it was to
</p>
<p>be expected fi-om the observations in the recital that
</p>
<p>the remedial statute it was about to pass was to be
</p>
<p>in its operation as extensive as the mischief of which
</p>
<p>they complain, and that there was no case to be ex-
</p>
<p>cepted from its operations, no reason being assigned
</p>
<p>why any ease should be excepted. The act goes on to
</p>
<p>say, " that in all cases where bills of indictment are
</p>
<p>to be laid before grand juries in Ireland fortheir con-
</p>
<p>sideration, the clerk of the crown at assizes, and the
</p>
<p>clerk of the peace at quarter sessions, or his or their
</p>
<p>deputy, shall endorse upon the back of the bill of
</p>
<p>indictment the names of the witnesses." That is,
</p>
<p>where such officers exist ; but that is not in exclusion
</p>
<p>of other cases where similar proper officers exist,
</p>
<p>though their offices are not distinctly enumerated in
</p>
<p>the act of parliament. If you take the meaning in-
</p>
<p>'sisted upon by the traversers, they impose a duty
</p>
<p>upon the clerk of the crown at the assizes, and
</p>
<p>the clerk of the peace at sessions, in cases where they
</p>
<p>have not the power of acting. Tliis case is unlike
</p>
<p>several others that have been stated. This is not a

<p>THE DEMUREEE.
</p>
<p>6S-
</p>
<p>sions," which words, he was of opinion, had been
</p>
<p>introduced into the act, not witli a view to confine
</p>
<p>its operation to any particular courts, but rather
</p>
<p>with a view to designate and particularise the officer
</p>
<p>by whom the duty of endorsing the names of the
</p>
<p>indictment was to be performed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin said tlie question to be consi-
</p>
<p>dered was this whether under the law, as it existed
</p>
<p>in this country, a bill of indictment could be legally
</p>
<p>found a true bill upon the testimony of witnesses
</p>
<p>not sworn in open court, but in the grand jury room,
</p>
<p>pursuant to the provisions of the act 1 and 2 Vic-
</p>
<p>toria, cap. 37. The question depended on the rela-
</p>
<p>tive construction put upon two acts of parliament,
</p>
<p>the one the 56th of George III., the other the act
</p>
<p>already referred to. In the arguments which had
</p>
<p>taken place with respect to these constructions,
</p>
<p>many authorities had been cited, which, in his
</p>
<p>opinion, did not at all bear upon the real question at
</p>
<p>issue, and of these he would, of course, not take
</p>
<p>any notice. Several positions, too, had been con-
</p>
<p>tended for on both sides, which, according to the
</p>
<p>view he took of the case, he did not deem at all
</p>
<p>necessary to discuss, no question as to their appli-
</p>
<p>cability appearing to him to exist or arise in the
</p>
<p>case. One proposition, however, had been put for-
</p>
<p>ward which certainly appeared to him a startling
</p>
<p>one. It wa5 this  that a grand jury might find a
</p>
<p>bill without evidence, and that the matter was not
</p>
<p>inquirable into in that court. Against that asser-
</p>
<p>tion he begged leave to protest, and to declare that
</p>
<p>an indictment could not be possibly found e.\cept upon
</p>
<p>the evidence of sworn witnesses lawfully introduced
</p>
<p> he meant, of course, regularly sworn. The ques-

</p>
<p>tion then became, whether the witnesses must be
</p>
<p>Bwom in court or before the grand jury ? Now,
</p>
<p>the 56th George III., distinctly and most ex-
</p>
<p>plicitly provided that no bill of indictment should
</p>
<p>be returned a true bill, unless the same had
</p>
<p>been found upon the evidence of one or more wit-
</p>
<p>nesses, sworn in open court, and produced before the
</p>
<p>grand jury. Thus, that statute declared the law:
</p>
<p>accordingly, that had been the law ever since. It
</p>
<p>was found, however, that this practice was in some
</p>
<p>respects bad, as regarded the administration of the
</p>
<p>oath in court. It was found to produce delay and
</p>
<p>certain want of decorum, and to be, in fact, very in-
</p>
<p>jurious to the administration of justice. The wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were sworn in a hurried manner, in batches,
</p>
<p>their affidavits were sent up to the grand jury, and
</p>
<p>they themselves were examined either immediately,
</p>
<p>or at considerable intervals. This was found to be
</p>
<p>injurious not only in practice, but in decorum, as it
</p>
<p>was separating the witness's mind from the impres-
</p>
<p>sion that he was giving his evidence under the sanc-
</p>
<p>tion of an oath. That inconvenience was general.
</p>
<p>It was found to prevail as well at the Commission
</p>
<p>Court of Dublin as at the assizes in the country.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the 1st and 2d Victoria, the act
</p>
<p>passed to remedy the inconvenience, is stated that
</p>
<p>the practice of swearing the witnesses in open court
</p>
<p>had been found to be injurious, and declared that
</p>
<p>its provisions were intended to remedy tliat incon-
</p>
<p>veniencean inconvenience as general as the provi-
</p>
<p>sions of the statute under which it was proposed to
</p>
<p>remedy it. Accordingly the statute enacted that in
</p>
<p>" all cases" where bills were to be laid before the
</p>
<p>grand juries in Ireland  that was, in every case

<p>shake his confidence in that decision. The learned
</p>
<p>judge concluded by again expressing his concurrence
</p>
<p>in the present judgment.
</p>
<p>Attorney- General  Your lordship will now give
</p>
<p>judgment of respondeas ouster in this case.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice nodded assent.
</p>
<p>Attomey-Gieneral  Let the clerk of the crown
</p>
<p>take down thejudgment. I intend to ask your lord-
</p>
<p>ships to pronounce a similar judgment in the cases
</p>
<p>of the other pleas put in by the other traversers, as
</p>
<p>they all separately put in the same pleas with some
</p>
<p>slight teolmical difference that I before referred to.
</p>
<p>A similar order will be made in each case, as sepa^
</p>
<p>rate judgments of respondeas ottster must be given,
</p>
<p>and it is necessary the judgments should be sepa-
</p>
<p>rately taken down in the rule book in each case.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Like case like rule.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Exactly so, my lord. And
</p>
<p>now the court having pronounced judgment of res-
</p>
<p>pondeas ouster in each case, what I would suggest is
</p>
<p>that the traversers be called upon their recogni-
</p>
<p>zances to appear and to plead instanter. In the case
</p>
<p>of the King v. Sheridan, and in the case of the King
</p>
<p>V. Johnson in England, reported in 6th East, 601,
</p>
<p>when a plea in abatement had been put in, and where
</p>
<p>the demurrer was allowed, the court awarded judg-
</p>
<p>ment of respondeas ouster, and it was then required
</p>
<p>of the traversers by the court that they should plead
</p>
<p>instanter or otherwise that judgment should be
</p>
<p>awarded against them instanter. In the case of the
</p>
<p>King V. Kirwan, judgment having been given on
</p>
<p>demurrer, and the demurrer having been allowed,
</p>
<p>it did not appear by the report that the parties
</p>
<p>pleaded instanter, but it appeared beyond doubt

</p>
<p>that they actually did plead instanter, because the
</p>
<p>trial was fixed instanter. By the 60th George III.,
</p>
<p>and the 1st George IV., the parties got four days to
</p>
<p>plead or demur, but eleven or twelve days had now
</p>
<p>elapsed since the entry of that rule. That four day
</p>
<p>rule has now expired two or three times over, and
</p>
<p>now, under the provisions of the act, I submit I am
</p>
<p>entitled to have the parties called on their recogni-
</p>
<p>zances to appear, and plead instanter, or if they re-
</p>
<p>fuse to plead, then to enter judgment against them
</p>
<p>on the general issue. He then read the 9th George
</p>
<p>IV., chap. 34, sec. 8.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell, Q.C., said he appeared for the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, to show their lordships respectfully, that
</p>
<p>they were entitled to a rule to plead over in chief
</p>
<p>after the court had pronounced judgment of re-
</p>
<p>spondeas ouster. With respect to the observations
</p>
<p>of the Attorney-General, he had to observe that,
</p>
<p>in the case of the King v. Sheridan, the whole pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding appeared to have been taken with the con-
</p>
<p>sent of the defendant, as no objection had been
</p>
<p>raised ; and it was agreed in open court between
</p>
<p>the leading counsel for the traverser and the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General of the day, to fix a day for the trial,
</p>
<p>and therefore he would say, with great respect, that
</p>
<p>that case decided nothing. With respect to the
</p>
<p>case of the King . Johnson, he admitted that, after
</p>
<p>argument, and after the plea in abatement had been
</p>
<p>disallowed, and judgment of respondeas ouster had
</p>
<p>been given, the court did direct the parties to plead
</p>
<p>forthwith, but there was no objection taken by the
</p>
<p>defendants to that proceeding ; and, therefore, he
</p>
<p>thought it stood upon the same footing as the pre-
</p>
<p>ceding. No point had been raised, or no question
</p>
<p>FOUE-DAY RULE,
</p>
<p>6T
</p>
<p>extended to " the Octave of the Purification," which
</p>
<p>feast the court was aware was celebrated on the 2d
</p>
<p>of February. That was one of the cases cited as
</p>
<p>governing the court in the case of the King v. Wil-
</p>
<p>liams, and yet under it the defendant was entitled to
</p>
<p>a four-day rule to plead over in chief. K that was
</p>
<p>the law in those times, and if such indulgence were
</p>
<p>then given to the parties to enable them to plead
</p>
<p>over, he submitted that in the present case, consi-
</p>
<p>dering the unprecedented length and complexity of
</p>
<p>the indictment to wliich the traversers were now
</p>
<p>called upon to plead in chief, he did not ask a great
</p>
<p>favour from the court, though he was willing to
</p>
<p>accept it as a favour, and not as a matter of right, in
</p>
<p>requesting their lordships to order the four-day rule
</p>
<p>to plead over in chief to be given.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside, Q.C., said he was on the same
</p>
<p>ride with Mr. Hatchell for Mr. O'Connell, and he
</p>
<p>respectfully submitted that he was entitled to require
</p>
<p>the four-day rule after judgment of respondcas ouster.
</p>
<p>He would contend that the statute of the 60th Geo.
</p>
<p>HL, referred to by the Attorney-General, had
</p>
<p>nothing to do with the case before the court, as their
</p>
<p>lordships had held that the plea in abatement fell
</p>
<p>within the section of the act. The case cited by his
</p>
<p>learned friend was also reported in Skinner, 217,
</p>
<p>where it was distinctly stated that the court gave
</p>
<p>two rules for joining in demurrer, as it did in plead-
</p>
<p>ing, and it then gave a peremptory rule, after which
</p>
<p>if the party did not join they would give judgment.
</p>
<p>After commenting at some length on the case of the
</p>
<p>King V. Elliot, as given in the several authorities, he
</p>
<p>referred to Kirwan's case, 31st volume of the State
</p>
<p>Trials, 575, wliich had been relied on by the At-

<p>torney-General. He did not know why the party
</p>
<p>had pleaded not guilty in the first instance in that
</p>
<p>case, but after that plea had been put in and issue
</p>
<p>joined, still, because they did not afterwards apply
</p>
<p>for the four-day rule to plead, the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>gravely put it forward as an authority why the rule
</p>
<p>should not be granted, But he referred to another
</p>
<p>case which he would admit would be more in point
</p>
<p>if it had been argued. The difficulty m that case
</p>
<p>was how to get the Hon. Robert Johnson to join in
</p>
<p>demurrer. He then cited that case from the 6th
</p>
<p>East 586, and then referred to the case of the King
</p>
<p>V. WiUiams, and said that that case showed the
</p>
<p>parties to be distinctly entitled to a four-day rule to
</p>
<p>plead over in chief after judgment of respondeas ouster.
</p>
<p>The first point to be considered was, whether there
</p>
<p>was an analogy between cases of misdemeanour and
</p>
<p>cases on the civil side of the court, and he contended
</p>
<p>such analogy did exist. In the case of the King v.
</p>
<p>Cooke, 1st Barnwell and Cresswell, 871, the plea in
</p>
<p>abatement contained a slight informality, and an
</p>
<p>application was made to the court to admit it. The
</p>
<p>court refused the motion, and it was ruled that the
</p>
<p>rule ax;ted on in civil cases was to be applied to mis-
</p>
<p>demeanours, of not allowing pleas in abatement to
</p>
<p>be amended. In the case of the King v. Taylor, 3d
</p>
<p>Barnwell and Cresswell, 512, it was also shown that
</p>
<p>an analogy existed between civil actions and misde-
</p>
<p>meanours. He also referred to 2d Archbold's Prac-
</p>
<p>tice by Chitty, 691, where it was laid down that after
</p>
<p>judgment of reipondeas ouster the defendant has four
</p>
<p>days to plead, and in illustration of that rule he
</p>
<p>quoted the case of Cantwell v. the Earl of Stirling,
</p>
<p>1st Moore and Scott, 305, where the defendant was
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TEIALfe.
</p>
<p>nistration of justice would be wholly impeded. Tiie
</p>
<p>accused party, when called on to plead, would then
</p>
<p>have nothing to do but to hand in a plea of abate-
</p>
<p>ment, which, though true in fact, might be quite
</p>
<p>immaterial in point of law, and by thus raising a
</p>
<p>question which did not at all affect the merits or
</p>
<p>legal bearing of his case, he entitled himself to four
</p>
<p>days' delay ; and then, after demurrers had been
</p>
<p>joined, and that the court decided that his plea in
</p>
<p>abatement was worthless, he had the modesty to
</p>
<p>come forward and demand four additional days to
</p>
<p>answer in chief. Why there would be no end to
</p>
<p>the delay, and delay would be a mockery. In the first
</p>
<p>instance, he had four days to plead  at the end of
</p>
<p>that period he put in a plea of abatement; that
</p>
<p>took up another day ; then, according to the rule of
</p>
<p>the court, four days must be granted for joining in
</p>
<p>the demurrer  that made nine days ; then the de-
</p>
<p>murrer came on to be argued, and the judges re-
</p>
<p>quired time to consider their decision, and thus a
</p>
<p>day or two more was consumed ; and by tliis means
</p>
<p>a delay of eleven or twelve days was consumed.
</p>
<p>And was it to be brooked, that after such delay as
</p>
<p>this an accused party should come forward and de-
</p>
<p>mand a further delay of four days, under the pre-
</p>
<p>text forsooth of having time to answer in chief!
</p>
<p>The object of the statute was to bring the party to
</p>
<p>issue on the subject at once, and he trusted the
</p>
<p>court would not be a party to frustrating that sta-
</p>
<p>tute. Mr. natchell had put it to the discretion of
</p>
<p>the court to grant this appUcation, and he (Mr.
</p>
<p>Brewster) would only remarlc that no special case
</p>
<p>had been made out to warrant their lordships in
</p>
<p>coming to such a conclusion. In point of fact, the

<p>traversers had got already more time than any par-
</p>
<p>ties ever obtained since the passing of tlie statute.
</p>
<p>What was to prevent their demurrer to the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, or pleading guilty ? The latter course re-
</p>
<p>quired little time. The learned gentleman con-
</p>
<p>cluded by calling on the court to call on the tra-
</p>
<p>versers to plead instanter.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton  How many days have elapsed
</p>
<p>since the traversers appeared?
</p>
<p>. Mr. Brewster  A fortnight, my lord.
</p>
<p>Mr. HatchcU wished to remark that the appearance
</p>
<p>in Elliott's case to which he referred was in person.
</p>
<p>The Cliief Justice said tliis appeared to be an ap-
</p>
<p>plication to the discretion of the court. It had been
</p>
<p>so stated by the counsel who made the application,
</p>
<p>and seemed to be so considered in Archbold, and
</p>
<p>some of the other authorities handed up to guide
</p>
<p>them in their decision. What was there to influence
</p>
<p>them on this occasion ? It was competent to the
</p>
<p>party who asked for delay to make a statement upon
</p>
<p>oath of the facts and particular circumstances wliich
</p>
<p>it lay with him to bring forward, or even to state
</p>
<p>generally. He was not able and could not be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to put in his plea at once to the merits of this
</p>
<p>case. He did not at all put forward in the way of
</p>
<p>blame or imputation, that he had by his counsel
</p>
<p>very ably and ingeniously argued a dilatory plea,
</p>
<p>instead of a plea to the merits. There was a great
</p>
<p>deal of matter in tliat plea, and he woidd saj' it was
</p>
<p>a subject matter very proper for discussion, and
</p>
<p>consideration, and adjudication by the court. Now,
</p>
<p>they came to another question. What was Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell to do now ? He had been furnished with
</p>
<p>a copy of this indictment, and had been given in
</p>
<p>TRIAL AT BAR.

<p>for a trial at bar.

<p>motion will be served on Friday, and I will on that

</p>
<p>Attorney-General  No, my lord.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Do you, Mr. Hatchell ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  No, my lord.

<p>Mr. O'Connell and the other traversers then left

<p>the court, followed by the majority of the persons

<p>present during the proceedings.

<p>The full court sat at eleven o'clock.

</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that in this case of the
</p>
<p>Queen v. O'Connell and others, he had humbly to
</p>
<p>move their lordships, that there should be a trial at

<p>appoint; and that the said 11th day of December,

<p>and the following days up to and including the 10th
</p>
<p>day of January, in the year of our Lord, 1844,
</p>
<p>should, for the purpose of such trial, be deemed and

<p>taken to be a part of this present Michaelmas Term,
</p>
<p>or for such other order as the court might think

<p>right. It was~ right to state to their lordships the

</p>
<p>actment in that behalf, and on the ground that the
</p>
<p>jury lists are at present under revision before the
</p>
<p>Right Hon. the Recorder, and will be completed on
</p>
<p>Tuesday next, and will come into operation on 1st
</p>
<p>of January, 1844, and also on the grounds of the
</p>
<p>magnitude and importance of the cause, the volumi-
</p>
<p>nous nature of the indictment, and the vast variety
</p>
<p>of matters alleged against the traversers, and the
</p>
<p>impossibility of being prepared to defend themselves
</p>
<p>in this cause, within a shorter period, which motion
</p>
<p>will be grounded on the several affidavits aforesaid,
</p>
<p>the information and indictment, and bill of particu-
</p>
<p>lars in this case, the nature of the case and reasons
</p>
<p>to be offered." That in fact, though a cross notice,
</p>
<p>stated shortly grounds of opposition to the motion
</p>
<p>that he brought under the consideration of the

<p>court ; and he should state to their lordships fairly

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>vrhich was within their lordships' judicial know-
</p>
<p>ledge, premising that it was new to him to be a just
</p>
<p>Cause of reproach for a person charged, or the coxin-
</p>
<p>sel under whose advice he acted, to use all the pri-
</p>
<p>vileges that the law allowed him for his defence. It
</p>
<p>might he a cause of reproach for a prosecutor to try-
</p>
<p>to abridge those privileges, or even to insist upon
</p>
<p>the rigid rule of right. K he seeks to deny those
</p>
<p>privileges it may be a cause of reproach to him, but
</p>
<p>it can be no cause of reproach to a traverser, who
</p>
<p>seeks to avail himself of those privileges. The in-
</p>
<p>dictment was found late in the evening  on that
</p>
<p>very day the Attorney-General sought to have them
</p>
<p>put in charge, and if he had succeeded the effect
</p>
<p>would be to deprive them of one of the few days
</p>
<p>that the act of parliament allowed them to plead.
</p>
<p>They insisted upon their right to have the indict-
</p>
<p>ment read, and by that means the attempt to put
</p>
<p>them in charge at once was frustrated, and they
</p>
<p>were not put in charge until the next day ; but still
</p>
<p>one day was lost to them by the officer refusing,
</p>
<p>without an order from the court, to allow a compa-
</p>
<p>rison of the indictment. Then there was an appli-
</p>
<p>cation made for the names of the witnesses, and
</p>
<p>With respect to the reproach of delay, that accu-
</p>
<p>sation could not be made with regard to that ap-
</p>
<p>plication, for that application was made while the
</p>
<p>rule to . plead was running. It was not made for
</p>
<p>the purpose of delay, but for an important rea-
</p>
<p>son. Until the statute of Victoria the witnesses
</p>
<p>were sworn in court. They only asked for their
</p>
<p>names because they were deprived of that opportu-
</p>
<p>nity of knowing them, and he tliought the appUcation
</p>
<p>was in accordance with the liberal spirit of the legis-

<p>lature that gave them a copy of the indictment.
</p>
<p>Therefore tliat application was not intended for
</p>
<p>delay. They then applied for a copy of the caption
</p>
<p>of the indictment, because the counsel for the tra-
</p>
<p>versers advised them that it would be necessary to
</p>
<p>procure it, in order to enable them to frame the plea,
</p>
<p>which was not then put in. Respectable solicitors
</p>
<p>of that court stated on oath that tlie application was
</p>
<p>not intended for delay, and it was, therefore, with
</p>
<p>regret he heard the Attorney-General reiterate the
</p>
<p>charge that those proceedings were intended for de-
</p>
<p>lay. Then came the time for pleading, and tlieir
</p>
<p>lordships would recollect what occurred, and the re-
</p>
<p>sistance of the Attorney-General to those pleas.
</p>
<p>He relied upon what he thought to he the strict rules
</p>
<p>of the court, and the provisions of the act of parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, and the court ruled against him. He tliought
</p>
<p>he had a right strictly to enforce the rule of the
</p>
<p>court to the prejudice of the traversers, but he
</p>
<p>not having such right they were allowed to put in
</p>
<p>those pleas, and it would be more gracious for him,
</p>
<p>even if he had the right, under the peculiar circum-
</p>
<p>stances of the case not to insist upon it. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General demurred to the pleas, and called on the
</p>
<p>traversers to join in demurrer instanter, refusing them
</p>
<p>the four-day rule to which they were entitled. He
</p>
<p>charged them with delay ; but though he stated that
</p>
<p>it was a rule that did not exist, their lordships found
</p>
<p>the practice of the court to be ivith them (the tra-
</p>
<p>versers), they accordingly claimed the benefit of that
</p>
<p>practice, and he submitted that they were not en-
</p>
<p>titled to any reproach for that. They got that four-
</p>
<p>day rule, and when it had expired sought for fur-
</p>
<p>ther time. Unfortunately the rules of the coiirt were

<p>and the inaccurate manner in which said lists were
</p>
<p>made up, by which it will appear that the christian
</p>
<p>names of 408 persons are not set forth, and the
</p>
<p>names of 38 mercantile firms are set down in the
</p>
<p>lists for 1843 in the said lists, without the names of
</p>
<p>the individuals composing said firms ; whereupon
</p>
<p>the said clerk of the peace agreed with deponent, that
</p>
<p>the said lists were most inaccurate and imperfect;
</p>
<p>and that the collectors of grand jury cess, though
</p>
<p>frequently remonstrated with, always neglected their
</p>
<p>duty in that respect ; and he the said clerk of the
</p>
<p>peace then stated that the Recorder of the said city
</p>
<p>had, while presiding in open court, and revising the
</p>
<p>said lists, frequently complained of the collectors'
</p>
<p>neglect of duty, and the said Dickenson further
</p>
<p>stated that he and his colleague, George Archer,
</p>
<p>Esquire, frequently had made similar complaints as
</p>
<p>to the inattention and inaccuracy of said collectors
</p>
<p>in that behalf. Saith that upon tlie occasion above
</p>
<p>referred to, deponent asked for copies of said collec-
</p>
<p>tors' lists for said years 1843 and 1844, but said
</p>
<p>Dickenson declined to give same, without consulta-
</p>
<p>tion with his colleague, although deponent offered
</p>
<p>to pay for satue. Saith he several times afterwards
</p>
<p>repeated said appUcation, without effect ; and on the
</p>
<p>23d of October last, deponent wrote a letter, of
</p>
<p>which the following is a copy, to said clerks of the
</p>
<p>peace :  " Gentlemen  I beg of you to furnish me
</p>
<p>with copies of the returns, made to your office, by
</p>
<p>the several grand jury cess collectors of tliis city, of
</p>
<p>persons entitled to serve as jurors for the year 1843,
</p>
<p>and for the ensuing year 1844. I will pay you for

<p>same. Your humble servant. Pierce Mahont.

<p>the borough of Dublin." And deponent saith that
</p>
<p>sjttd clerks thereupon promised to give an answer in
</p>
<p>two days. Deponent received copies of said Usts on
</p>
<p>the 30th day of October, for which he was obliged
</p>
<p>to pay the sum of 22Z. 2s., the said clerks of the
</p>
<p>pSace having informed deponent, as he has no doubt
</p>
<p>tlie fact was, that there were no printed copies
</p>
<p>thereof, and that it never had been the habit of the
</p>
<p>said coUeotors to have said lists printed. Deponent
</p>
<p>saith that pending said applications to said clerks
</p>
<p>of the peace, this deponent applied again at the
</p>
<p>sheriff's office for a copy of said jurors' book, and
</p>
<p>upon one occasion he observed upon the inaccu-
</p>
<p>racy of said lists, which he deponent had seen at the
</p>
<p>office of the said clerks of the peace ; and as to the
</p>
<p>non-compliance of the said collectors with the terms
</p>
<p>of the act for regiJating juries, and of the precept
</p>
<p>issued to them by the clerks of the peace pursuant to
</p>
<p>sail act. And deponent saith that upon such occa-
</p>
<p>sion said GeorgePounder, the sub-sheriff, concurred in
</p>
<p>deponent's observation, saying, that same had been a
</p>
<p>constant source of complaint in the same office ; and
</p>
<p>so much so, that Sir Edward Borough, Bart., the late
</p>
<p>high sheriff of said city, had made an official com-
</p>
<p>plaint to this honourable court thereupon during his
</p>
<p>year of office. Saith that deponent having made
</p>
<p>personal inquiry from two of the said collectors, Mr.

<p>Heniy Vigne, and Mr. Newenham Graydon, as to the
</p>
<p>causes of the great inaccuracy and deficiency of their

<p>lists, as returns to the clerk of the peace's precept ;

<p>and notwithstanding the provisions of the statute,

<p>and that they the said Vigne and Graydon replied in

</p>
<p>lEting jury book, and the causes which must operate
</p>
<p>in producing a more perfect one for the succeeding
</p>
<p>year. And deponent saith, that having examined
</p>
<p>the lists returned by the grand jury cess collectors
</p>
<p>in 1842, out of which lists alone the jurors' book for
</p>
<p>the year 18-43 ought to have been framed, he (depo-
</p>
<p>nent) verily beUeved that the existing jui-ors' book
</p>
<p>for the present year, an inspection of, and access to
</p>
<p>which hath been refused to be given to deponent up
</p>
<p>to the present time, and also the special jurors' list
</p>
<p>which has been framed therefrom, are grossly im-
</p>
<p>perfect ; and deponent verily believes that a special
</p>
<p>jurors' list, framed according to law, and calculated
</p>
<p>to secure a fair, impartial, and satisfactory trial of
</p>
<p>the- said traversers, or any of them, cannot be had
</p>
<p>until the revisioit now in progress is complete, and a pro-
</p>
<p>per jurors' book, and a proper special jurors' list
</p>
<p>prepared therefrom, be had and perfected, according
</p>
<p>to law, nor until said jurors' book, and said special
</p>
<p>jurors' list to be taken therefrom, be prepared and
</p>
<p>brought into use for the following year ; and in said
</p>
<p>revision the said Recorder has added to the names
</p>
<p>of the jurors their respective quaUfications, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to rank and property, so far as he has been
</p>
<p>enabled to do so, but that he has not, during said

<p>seven days, so revised more than about UOO names,

<p>which is not more than about one-fourth of the

<p>number of persons appearing on the collectors' lists

<p>before him. Independent of the persons entitled to

<p>serve, but who have not as yet claimed their right

<p>to do so. Deponent saith that he begs leave to refer
</p>
<p>to the several lists for 1843 and 1844, now in the
</p>
<p>official custody of the said clerk of the peace, and

<p>also to the jurors' book, and the special jurors' list

</p>
<p>for the present year, in the official custody of the
</p>
<p>high sheriff of said county, or of his under-sheriff,
</p>
<p>and deponent saith that by a comparison between
</p>
<p>the lists for 1843, and those for 1844, as they now
</p>
<p>are, it will be shown that the supposed revision for
</p>
<p>1843 was merely formal and totally insufficient.
</p>
<p>Saith that since the preparation of the foregoing
</p>
<p>portion of this affidavit, this deponent has applied
</p>
<p>to George Magrath, deputy clerk of the peace for
</p>
<p>the city of Dublin, for a return of the names of
</p>
<p>persons struck off the said lists by the said Recorder,
</p>
<p>also the ntimber of the names of persons qualified to
</p>
<p>be special jurors, described as such by rank or for-
</p>
<p>tune, also the names of persons put on said lists, by
</p>
<p>said Recorder, as qualified to be special jurors, also
</p>
<p>the number of common jurors added to said lists,
</p>
<p>and also the number of persons whose names have
</p>
<p>been corrected up to the evening of Tuesday, the
</p>
<p>2Ist instant, and that the said deputy clerk of the
</p>
<p>peace has furnished to said deponent a tabular state-
</p>
<p>ment set forth in the schedule 4, to this affidavit
</p>
<p>annexed, of the said several classes, which state-
</p>
<p>ment this deponent believes to be correct and true,
</p>
<p>and deponent has no doubt that iu the further pro-
</p>
<p>gress of said revision, that many further important
</p>
<p>alterations will be made in the said collectors' lists,
</p>
<p>and this deponent saith that, in addition to the num-
</p>
<p>ber of persons described by the present revised lists
</p>
<p>as entitled to be special jurors, a vast number of
</p>
<p>persons are named in such lists whose description
</p>
<p>has not been corrected, and if properly described,
</p>
<p>would be entitled to be put upon the special jurors'
</p>
<p>list. And this deponent believes, that there are a

<p>said Attorney-General ; and that office copies of a
</p>
<p>certain information, purporting to have been sworn
</p>
<p>by one Frederick Bond Hughes, and of a certain
</p>
<p>other information purporting to have been sworn
</p>
<p>by William Kemmis, Esq. the Crown Solicitor, con-
</p>
<p>cerned in said prosecution, and also of a certain

<p>other information, purportingto have been sworn by
</p>
<p>one Charles Vernon, were obtained from said office
</p>
<p>on or about the seventeenth day of October, afore-

<p>said. And all these deponents say that the said in-

<p>said informations of the said Charles Vernon, do not
</p>
<p>nor does either of them contain any statement of

<p>facts of a nature sufficient to enable the defendants

<p>or deponents to make any practical arrangements

<p>for the defence necessary in this prosecution. And

<p>the said Frederick Bond Hughes, William Kemmis,

<p>James Ireland, and Charles Vernon, they believe

<p>this cause was submitted to the gi'aud jury, and that

<p>same was not returned a true bill by said j ury until

<p>Mr. Henn  ^Last night, my lord, the 23d.

<p>Attorney-General  I do not make any objection
</p>
<p>to the date of the notice.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I only wanted to know the date it

<p>was sent up to us in blank.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  It would be necessary to caU their

<p>lordships' attention to schedule four of the list, to
</p>
<p>show their lordships that important changes would

<p>he made when the Recorder had completed his revi-

<p>one-fourth of the list, and they found the result of
</p>
<p>that revision to be that on the special jury list there
</p>
<p>were 513 qualified persons, when the Recorder had
</p>
<p>gone through one-fourth. On the present there
</p>
<p>were only 388, of whom 70 are disqualified. He had
</p>
<p>next to call their lordships' attention to the pro-

<p>visions of the jury act, and when he had done so

<p>their lordships would see the vast importance of the

<p>jury as the provisions of this statute intended for

</p>
<p>no person could serve on that jury but a' person
</p>
<p>whose name was ou the hook. Those beinp: the
</p>
<p>proTisions of the act, let them see the state of thinps
</p>
<p>at present in this great city. There were only 4000
</p>
<p>and odd names on the common jury book to serve as
</p>
<p>jurors, and on the special jury list there are only
</p>
<p>388 names, not more than 300 of them being really
</p>
<p>qualified, and of that 300 only 23 were Roman Ca-
</p>
<p>tholics  that was the state of the lists at present.
</p>
<p>There had been a version of the list going on before
</p>
<p>the Recorder, and it was sworn that the Recorder
</p>
<p>had repeatedly e.^ressed his satisfaction at the re-
</p>
<p>sult likely to be produced by that revision, that the
</p>
<p>number of persons to serve as special jurors by that
</p>
<p>revision were already over 500, whereas they did
</p>
<p>not amount to more than 300 before  that 100 Ca-
</p>
<p>tholics were already put on the list, though there
</p>
<p>were only 23 on the list before, and Mr. Mahony
</p>
<p>swore, from his knowledge of the citj', that there
</p>
<p>were 300 qualified whose names were omitted. It
</p>
<p>was impossible, therefore, that a fair and satisfac-
</p>
<p>tory trial could be had from any jury returned as
</p>
<p>the list was at present constituted. This was a
</p>
<p>most important prosecution ; it was not an ordinary
</p>
<p>case at all  it was one of vast importance ; and it
</p>
<p>was of vast importance to the ends of justice, to use
</p>
<p>the words of Lord EUenborough, that the admini-
</p>
<p>stration of justice should not only be pure, but un-
</p>
<p>suspected. It was impossible that any verdict had
</p>
<p>from a jury taken from such a small number out of
</p>
<p>the immense mass that ought to be returned could
</p>
<p>be satisfactory. He would submit that on this
</p>
<p>ground alone the application was most reasonable,
</p>
<p>and that application was, that this trial should not

<p>take place in the present vacation, and that no day
</p>
<p>earlier than the first of February should be ap-
</p>
<p>pointed for it.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The first of January I think you
</p>
<p>said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  The 1 st of February, my lord. The
</p>
<p>revised list woxild not come into operation until the
</p>
<p>1st of January. There would be six days to sum-
</p>
<p>mon the jury ; that would bring it near the next
</p>
<p>Term, and they proposed that the trial should take
</p>
<p>place on the 1st February, and after HUary Term,
</p>
<p>for the reasons mentioned in the afiidavit. They
</p>
<p>showed that the present jury-book was incorrect,
</p>
<p>and that as it was formed a satisfactory jury could
</p>
<p>not be procured. They showed that from the course
</p>
<p>taken before the Recorder that there was every rea-
</p>
<p>son to believe that on, the 1st of January they would
</p>
<p>have a jury-book from which a jury beyond sus-
</p>
<p>picion could be selected. Upon that branch of the
</p>
<p>case he would abstain from saying any more at pre-
</p>
<p>sent, but he had another aflSdavit which sustained
</p>
<p>the second ground mentioned in his notice for a
</p>
<p>postponement of the trial in this case. The affidavit
</p>
<p>Avas made by the solicitors fon the several parties.
</p>
<p>(Mr. Henn here read the affidavit, which will be
</p>
<p>found in our seventy-second page, and then conti-
</p>
<p>nued :)  That affidavit was sworn by all the soli-
</p>
<p>citors concerned for the traversers, and the tra-
</p>
<p>versers had made a short afiidavit verifying it. He
</p>
<p>abstained, while reading that afiidavit, from offering
</p>
<p>any comment upon the facts which it disclosed 
</p>
<p>they spoke for themselves more strongly than any
</p>
<p>comment he could make upon it. If he took up the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars alone and relied upon it, it would

</p>
<p>was no part of his dutj' ; it was a course which he
</p>
<p>never unnecessarily adopted, to attribute to gentle-
</p>
<p>men making affidavits that they intentionally stated
</p>
<p>what was not true, and he was willing to believe
</p>
<p>this, that every gentleman who made an affidavit in
</p>
<p>this case did beUeve that what he stated was true.
</p>
<p>It was not a part of his business to cast imputations,
</p>
<p>but he had at the same time a right to form his own
</p>
<p>opinion upon fa<;ts ; and while he believed that the
</p>
<p>gentlemen swearing those affidavits believed their
</p>
<p>object was not delay, still he certainly must reiterate
</p>
<p>his charge, that the proceedings which had been
</p>
<p>taken were for what he considered purposes of delay.
</p>
<p>He promised their lordships that he would be very
</p>
<p>short in the few observations which he found it ne-
</p>
<p>cessary for him to make in reply to Mr. Henn's re-
</p>
<p>marks. His learned friend commenced his statement
</p>
<p>by referring to their application to enter the rule to
</p>
<p>plead on the evening of the day on which the indict-
</p>
<p>ment was found. But in so doing he made no ap-
</p>
<p>plication not warranted by act of parliament  the
</p>
<p>act of parliament that the defendant was to plead in
</p>
<p>four days after being charged under the indictment.
</p>
<p>The indictment came down from the grand jury,
</p>
<p>and the traversers were charged, but the court sug-
</p>
<p>gested that it would be substantially depriving them
</p>
<p>of a day, if the rule was to reckon from that evening,
</p>
<p>and it was in the recollection of their lordships tliat
</p>
<p>he at once acquiesced in the suggestion of the court.
</p>
<p>The next step taken was by Mr. Henn, or those
</p>
<p>connected with him, and was an application tliat
</p>
<p>the copy of the indictment furnished should be com-
</p>
<p>pared. He opposed that motion as being unnecesary,
</p>
<p>the copy having been already certified, and printed

</p>
<p>from the same tj'pe. The object of that comparison,
</p>
<p>he believed then, and he believes now, was for the
</p>
<p>purpose of delaj'. The next step taken was an ap-
</p>
<p>plication by the other side to the court, to order the
</p>
<p>crown to give the names of the witnesses endorsed
</p>
<p>on the bill of indictment, and the ground on which
</p>
<p>that application was contended to be supported was,
</p>
<p>not that the names were necessary for the defence
</p>
<p>of the parties, but it was grounded on this argu-
</p>
<p>ment, that the crown had been required by the court
</p>
<p>to furnish a copy of the indictment, and that the
</p>
<p>witnesses' names, being a part of the indictment,
</p>
<p>the order of the court had not been complied with,
</p>
<p>and he opposed the application on that ground.
</p>
<p>The next motion was for a copy of the caption, and
</p>
<p>was grounded on the same argument  namely, tliat
</p>
<p>the caption was a i)art of the indictment. Now,
</p>
<p>what was the object of those motions ? That the
</p>
<p>object was delay, was not a matter resulting from
</p>
<p>any interference of his, but that such was the object
</p>
<p>was proved by nine other notices of motion, which
</p>
<p>had been all withdrawn, and not brought under the
</p>
<p>notice of the court at all. They were to set aside
</p>
<p>the rule to plead, because the copy of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment ordered by the court had not been furnished,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it did not contain the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses or a copy of the caption. These nine no-
</p>
<p>tices were withdrawn and not brought under the
</p>
<p>consideration of the court or of the public, but they
</p>
<p>proved that the object of the parties were delay. In
</p>
<p>the discharge of his public duty he opposed those
</p>
<p>motions. He deliberately considered it necessary,
</p>
<p>in the discharge of a public duty, to do so, and he
</p>
<p>opposed them successfully. Because he said that
</p>
<p>POSTfONfiMENT OF THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>If
</p>
<p>satisfied that those gentlemen who swore affidavits
</p>
<p>did entertain a different view  still, he deliber-
</p>
<p>ately entertained the opinion that they were for
</p>
<p>delay, without a shadow of doubt being on his
</p>
<p>mind on the subject. Having said so much with
</p>
<p>regard to the preliminary proceedings, which
</p>
<p>he would not have considered it necessary to
</p>
<p>say a word about if his learned friend, Mr, Henn,
</p>
<p>had not introduced the subject, he would next
</p>
<p>go into those matters which were more imme-
</p>
<p>diately the subject of the present motion. The
</p>
<p>ground on which his learned friend, Mr. Henn,
</p>
<p>rested his motion was, that no proceedings ought
</p>
<p>to be taken pending the trial of this momentous
</p>
<p>case to prejudice the administration of justice. He
</p>
<p>could ivish that that observation, which was worthy
</p>
<p>of the character of his learned and respected friend,
</p>
<p>had been durmg the course of the last month im-
</p>
<p>pressed on the minds of his clients. He wished it
</p>
<p>had been generally felt as it ought to be felt, that
</p>
<p>pending a great prosecution of that description, and
</p>
<p>he was ready to admit that perhaps there was no
</p>
<p>trial of so great moment took place in any period
</p>
<p>of the history of this country ; it would be most
</p>
<p>desirable on all sides if that advice which had fallen
</p>
<p>from his learned friend had been attended to, and if
</p>
<p>the attempts which had been made to prejudice the
</p>
<p>administration of justice and to poison the public
</p>
<p>mind pending the prosecutions had not been adopted,
</p>
<p>and that by those whose counsel deprecated it. It
</p>
<p>had been further stated by liis learned friend, who
</p>
<p>had stated his case with that ability which charac-
</p>
<p>"terized every thing he did, that he opposed the
</p>
<p>application with respect to fixing a day for the trial

</p>
<p>on two distinct grounds. The first of these grounds
</p>
<p>to which he would advert was that which his
</p>
<p>learned friend had last mentioned, and that was the
</p>
<p>great magnitude of the case, the number of meet-
</p>
<p>ings which had taken place, and which were ad-
</p>
<p>verted to either in the indictment or in the bill of
</p>
<p>particulars. He stated that it was impossible con-
</p>
<p>sistently with the time which had elapsed since the
</p>
<p>informations were sworn, although the utmost ac-
</p>
<p>tivity had been used, for the defendants' solicitors
</p>
<p>to make the various inquiries which might be ne-
</p>
<p>cessary, and which they said were necessary for
</p>
<p>their defence. As to the several matters which
</p>
<p>had taken place at those meetings respectively,
</p>
<p>which had been held in so many different parts of
</p>
<p>Ireland, they stated in their affidavits that it would
</p>
<p>be a denial of justice to the defendants if time
</p>
<p>were not given to them. He might observe with
</p>
<p>respect to that portion of the case that none of those
</p>
<p>meetings adverted to in the indictments or in the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars had been held secretly, or in a
</p>
<p>manner not notorious to the public or to the de-
</p>
<p>fendants themselves. Some of the defendants were
</p>
<p>present at every one of those meetings, and the pre-
</p>
<p>cise detail of every thing which occurred preliminary
</p>
<p>to and at those meetings were detailed at length by
</p>
<p>the public press  by the reporters of three of the
</p>
<p>defendants themselves  who are imder their con-
</p>
<p>trol, and capable of verifying every word of what
</p>
<p>was put forward in the newspapers of which they
</p>
<p>are the owners. It was impossible to suppose any
</p>
<p>case that was ever brought to trial in which the
</p>
<p>parties ought to be so well prepared, considering
</p>
<p>all the circumstances, unless, indeed, this be their

</p>
<p>his power the technical objections made to the pro-
</p>
<p>gress of that momentous case, and although he had,
</p>
<p>in the discharge of his imperative duty, forced the
</p>
<p>defendants to plead  ^for he could call it by no other
</p>
<p>name than coercion  although he had driven them
</p>
<p>out of every attempt made at delay, another duty
</p>
<p>imposed itself upon him when the cause was at
</p>
<p>issue. He had a duty to discharge not only to the
</p>
<p>crown but to the public ; and he agreed with his
</p>
<p>learned friend, Mr. Henn, that it would not be de-
</p>
<p>sirable that a trial should take place so rapidly, or
</p>
<p>under such circumstances as would enable any fair,
</p>
<p>unprejudiced mind to say that he had pressed for-
</p>
<p>ward the defendants improperly. Now he would
</p>
<p>say, so far as he was individually concerned, he felt
</p>
<p>an anxiety beyond what language could express to
</p>
<p>have that case brought forward to trial. He had
</p>
<p>been subject personally to imputations, and he had
</p>
<p>necessarily the strongest desire, not to anticipate
</p>
<p>what would take place at the trial, hut a desire not
</p>
<p>only before the jury who would try that case, but
</p>
<p>before another tribunal that would also try it  the
</p>
<p>i nhabitants of the British empire  that the day of
</p>
<p>trial should arrive, and he should not permit, so far
</p>
<p>as any humble resistance of his could prevent it,
</p>
<p>any attempt to keep the day of trial from being
</p>
<p>fixed at a period when, without pressing ou the de-
</p>
<p>fendants in a manner which every fair man would
</p>
<p>consider fair and reasonable, he would, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, resist to the utmost of his power any thing
</p>
<p>like unfair or unnecessary delay. Under these cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, and he confessed with a degree of
</p>
<p>anxiety greater than he ever felt at any period
</p>
<p>of his life, lie had endeavoured to come to the

</p>
<p>consideration of what he ought to do in the dis-
</p>
<p>charge of his duty ; and he believed that, on the
</p>
<p>whole, the best course that a public man could
</p>
<p>adopt was, without reference to what might be said
</p>
<p>on the subject, conscientiously to come to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion of what he believed to be riglit, and then to
</p>
<p>take that step ; and, although he would resist the
</p>
<p>postponement of that trial as far as he could do to
</p>
<p>the first of February, he was, after the statements
</p>
<p>that had been made on oath, and the facts stated in
</p>
<p>those  affidavits, which he should add were of great
</p>
<p>importance, and after, he believed, as anxious a
</p>
<p>consideration as ever was brought to bear on a case
</p>
<p>in the mind.of a public man, come to the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that he would best discharge his duty if he were
</p>
<p>not to oppose a postponement of the trial until the
</p>
<p>second day of the approaching term. He would on
</p>
<p>no account consent to having the case postponed till
</p>
<p>the after-sittings of the next term ; but he had no
</p>
<p>objection that it should be fixed for liearing on the
</p>
<p>first Monday of the terra, whenever that would be,
</p>
<p>and he believed it would fall on the 15th of January.
</p>
<p>He was perfectly aware of the public inconvenience
</p>
<p>that must arise from the trial at bar of such a case
</p>
<p>in term ; but although mischief to some individuals
</p>
<p>might accrue, they were in that court, and they
</p>
<p>came into it as suitors, subject to the rule that public
</p>
<p>justice, in the case of a prosecution by the crown,
</p>
<p>must not be delayed in the first criminal court in the
</p>
<p>land. By ceding this extension of time he should
</p>
<p>put an end to the objection made to the present jury
</p>
<p>pannel,on the ground tliat they could not have a fair
</p>
<p>trial by it. That objection must now fall to the
</p>
<p>ground, for before the period which he had named,
</p>
<p>POSTPONEMENT OF THE TRIAL,
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>taken place upon various days in October. For a
</p>
<p>long time the traversers were in the dark as to the
</p>
<p>precise character and extent of the offences alleged
</p>
<p>against them, for at first no information whatever
</p>
<p>was given to them with respect to the exact nature
</p>
<p>of the charges beyond what appeared upon the face
</p>
<p>of the informations. Upon the 8th of November the
</p>
<p>bill of indictment was found a true biU, and it pre-
</p>
<p>sented several charges of conspiracy, and a detail of
</p>
<p>no less than 58 alleged overt acts, explanatory of
</p>
<p>what it was intended by the crown to rely on in
</p>
<p>support of those charges. The indictment was un-
</p>
<p>derstood to contain allusions to forty-three meet-
</p>
<p>ings, and reference was made in the counts to
</p>
<p>ninety-three alleged illegal publications in cer-
</p>
<p>tain newspapers : but when a perfect bill of parti-
</p>
<p>culars was at length furnished to the traversers (and
</p>
<p>be it remembered, it was not delivered until the 14th
</p>
<p>of November) the traversers found to their astonish-
</p>
<p>ment that further allusion was made in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment to 49 additional meetings, and 112 additional
</p>
<p>newspaper publications, so that they were now
</p>
<p>called upon to prepare for a trial in which was in-
</p>
<p>volved an investigation into the circumstances con-
</p>
<p>nected with no less than 92 meetings, and into the
</p>
<p>alleged consequences ,of no less than 204 publica-
</p>
<p>tions in newspapers. Need he call upon their lord-
</p>
<p>ships to consider what an expenditure of time and
</p>
<p>labour was necessary in order to make preparations
</p>
<p>for such a trial ? It was an error of the learned
</p>
<p>Attorney-General to suppose that all they had to do
</p>
<p>was to remember the meetings, and call to mind
</p>
<p>whether they had attended them or not. The very
</p>
<p>first sentence of the bill of particulars would show

</p>
<p>that every circumstance connected with those meet-
</p>
<p>ings was to be made the subject of the most minute
</p>
<p>and careful investigation, for they were told that
</p>
<p>the crown intended to give in evidence the speeches
</p>
<p>that , were made there  the resolutions that were
</p>
<p>passed there ; in fact, a detail of all the proceedings
</p>
<p>that took place at each of them  and finally, even
</p>
<p>to adduce evidence to show the manner and order
</p>
<p>in which the multitudes proceeded to those meet-
</p>
<p>ings. Now, when the traversers came before their
</p>
<p>lordships soliciting adequate time for preparation,
</p>
<p>in order that they, too, as well as the crown, might
</p>
<p>be enabled to adduce evidence upon more numerous
</p>
<p>and elaborate points, what answer was it to their ap-
</p>
<p>plication to tell them that they knew the meetings
</p>
<p>that were held  that they were public meetings, and
</p>
<p>that consequently the traversers must konw all
</p>
<p>about them ? It was absolutely indispensable for
</p>
<p>the ends of justice that proper and adequate time
</p>
<p>should be granted, to enable the traversers to make
</p>
<p>preparations for their trial  for it was impossible to
</p>
<p>say on what points the Attorney-General might en-
</p>
<p>deavour to fasten his case, and it therefore behoved
</p>
<p>them to be prepared at all points. On the 14th of
</p>
<p>JTovember the Attorney-General not only informed
</p>
<p>them that he would rely on everything in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, but told them that he would apply evidence
</p>
<p>to each and every of the distinct transactious men-
</p>
<p>tioned in the indictment, whether the same had
</p>
<p>reference to public meetings or to pubUcations in
</p>
<p>the newspapers. How were the traversers to make
</p>
<p>their preparations ? Witnesses, credible and respect-

<p>able witnesses, must be procured to give testimony,

<p>_ The Chief Justice said that the court were of opi-

<p>nion that it was not necessary to call upon the Soli-

<p>bear purposely throwing out anything like an expres-

</p>
<p>rits of the present case. In the first place, except from
</p>
<p>popular report, which was nothing ; they did not
</p>
<p>know anything at all about it. In the next place, it
</p>
<p>would be premature to express a knowledge of what
</p>
<p>they did happen to know before the case came on for
</p>
<p>trial, when the accused have to meet the charge that

<p>will be made against them, and when they will be

<p>prepared to do so. It was of the utmost importance

<p>that a due regard should be paid to the due adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of justice. The punishment of crime, if it
</p>
<p>had been committed, was not to be overlooked, or
</p>
<p>frustrated, nor upon the other hand was it consistent
</p>
<p>with the due administration of justice for any ac-
</p>
<p>cused person to be brought and put upon his trial
</p>
<p>until he had every due and reasonable means of de-
</p>
<p>fending himself. The Attorney-General had very
</p>
<p>properly given way to the postponement of the trial
</p>
<p>of this case until everything like an imputation upon
</p>
<p>the selection of the jury was to be remedied by the
</p>
<p>process of revision which it appeared on all hands
</p>
<p>was now going on before the Recorder. He had ac-
</p>
<p>ceded at once to the representation made, that it was
</p>
<p>necessary to the ends of justice, and for the satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion of the public mind, that the jury lists should be
</p>
<p>put upon a different footing in the course of the pre-
</p>
<p>sent revision, so that all persons interested in this
</p>
<p>great and public trial should be satisfied with the
</p>
<p>justness and correctness of the tribunal before which
</p>
<p>the case was to be investigated. Therefore, the ap-
</p>
<p>plication for a postponement on that ground was ac-
</p>
<p>ceded to by the Attorney-General, and the day on
</p>
<p>which he now proposed for the going on of the trial,
</p>
<p>would amply meet the anxiety of the party and the
</p>
<p>public to have the jury list corrected in the manner
</p>
<p>in which it was alleged it ought to be, and certainly
</p>
<p>would be before the present tribunal (the Recorder
</p>
<p>of Dublin), which was appointed by the law for the
</p>
<p>revision of this list. It then remained to be consi-
</p>
<p>dered whether the day named by the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral  the fifteenth of January  would be sufficiently
</p>
<p>late to comprehend the new jury act, and whether

<p>that day was not also sufficient for all reasonable

<p>items of the several charges on which the traversers
</p>
<p>were to be called upon to account when they came
</p>
<p>on trial, and they were furnished with that bill of
</p>
<p>particulars on the 16th of November. Now, there-
</p>
<p>fore, from the 16th of this month they were per-
</p>
<p>fectly well aware of all the particulars for which
</p>
<p>they were to account, and for which they were to
</p>
<p>stand their trial on the 15th of Januarj'. Taking
</p>
<p>the time for which they were to account to be the
</p>
<p>16th November, when the information given to them
</p>
<p>was complete (they said they could not be ready
</p>
<p>for their trial on the 15th of January next), the
</p>
<p>time was this  14 days in November, 31 days in
</p>
<p>December, and there were 15 days in January.

<p>Mr. Pigot  Just two months.

<p>Chief Justice  That made sixty days, in order to
</p>
<p>prepare for trial of a variety of acts imputed to
</p>
<p>them, and alleged to have been committed within
</p>
<p>the last year, and all in the recollection of every-
</p>
<p>body. There was no difficulty in finding witnesses ;
</p>
<p>none was alleged as growing out of any peculiarity
</p>
<p>in the case, and every witness which the parties had
</p>
<p>to call upon being resident within the kingdom of
</p>
<p>Ireland  at least there was no statement that they
</p>
<p>were elsewhere, or that the parties had to go look
</p>
<p>for them to any other country. Now the court
</p>
<p>were of opinion that appeared to he a siifficient
</p>
<p>time for those parties respectively to be prepared to

<p>stand their trial. There was no fatality alleged
</p>
<p>which would deprive them of the power of being
</p>
<p>prepared for trial at the end of two months from
</p>
<p>the time they got notice. There was no statement
</p>
<p>that satisfied the court that those two months, under

<p>the circumstances, were not abundant time for those

<p>respective parties to be prepared for their defence.
</p>
<p>The interests of the public, and the administration
</p>
<p>of public justice, required that the investigation of
</p>
<p>crime, if it had been committed, should not be de-
</p>
<p>layed by unnecessary postponement, and upon the
</p>
<p>whole, without meaning to give the most remote
</p>
<p>shade of an opinion on the merits of the case one
</p>
<p>way or another, the court were of opinion that no
</p>
<p>sufficient case for a further postponement had been
</p>
<p>made out, that would satisfy the conscience of the
</p>
<p>court, and of the public. They were of opinion it

<p>had not been made, and in exercise of the discre-

<p>Mr. Steele here rose and said  I most respectfully

<p>beg permission to make a single observation to the

<p>court.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice The judgment of the court has
</p>
<p>been given, and your time for speaking is past.
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele  I have but one observation to make,
</p>
<p>my lord.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I fear we cannot hear you, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele.
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele  My lord, I hope I will have the same
</p>
<p>magnificent justice from you that I have had from
</p>
<p>your illustrious brother when I was tried before
</p>
<p>him. My lords, I feel it right to rise lest my si-
</p>
<p>lence on any particular point, if I were to be silent,
</p>
<p>should be construed by your lordships into an ac-
</p>
<p>quiescence. The Lord Chief Justice, in his judg-
</p>
<p>ment, stated that all the witnesses are resident in

<p>Ireland. Now, I pray leave most respectfully to

</p>
<p>the course of legislation in Ireland ; and finally, on
</p>
<p>the universal practice of England, and the absence
</p>
<p>of all practices here. If ever the nature of a charge
</p>
<p>and the position of a traverser justified a demand of
</p>
<p>the names of his accusers, that demand was justified
</p>
<p>in this prosecution. Mr. Gartlan, the attorney for
</p>
<p>the defendant, swore that he considered tlie furnish-
</p>
<p>ing of the names on the bacli of the indictment es-
</p>
<p>sential to his defence, and when the person, of all
</p>
<p>others, most competent to form an opinion on the
</p>
<p>subject pledged his oath to such a statement, would
</p>
<p>the court refuse to the accused the means of obtain-
</p>
<p>ing justice? The affidavit of Mr. Gartlan should
</p>
<p>be conclusive on this matter : but there was no diffi-
</p>
<p>culty in sustaining it by a reference to the nature of
</p>
<p>the accusation. Even in common cases their lord-
</p>
<p>ships must have continually had judicial experience
</p>
<p>of the importance of inquiry as to the character of
</p>
<p>witnesses, and their means of knowledge for the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of innocence and the discovery of truth.
</p>
<p>How often had a perjurer been discredited, not by
</p>
<p>any distinct contradiction of his statements, but by
</p>
<p>proof of his want of faithworthiness ? How often,
</p>
<p>in every criminal court, were fabricated charges
</p>
<p>met by exposing the absence of proper means of
</p>
<p>knowledge in the fabricator, and demonstrating the
</p>
<p>impossibility of the truth of his story ? It was plain
</p>
<p>that, for the purpose of defence, even in a common
</p>
<p>case where the sphere of action was limited, and tlie
</p>
<p>facts to be investigated, and the persons to be pro-
</p>
<p>duced were necessarily very few, the grossest in-
</p>
<p>justice might be prevented by enabling a traverser
</p>
<p>to know his accusers before his trial ; but the case
</p>
<p>of the defendants here was no common case. It was

<p>without example in the history of criminal juris-
</p>
<p>prudence, in the magnitude and complexity of its
</p>
<p>details, the extent of time and space through which
</p>
<p>the transactions proposed for inquiry are stated to
</p>
<p>have ranged, and tlie difliculties of preparation in
</p>
<p>which it involves the traverser. He resides in Dub-
</p>
<p>lin, and he is called on to answer as to nearly one
</p>
<p>hundred meetings, held in almost every county in
</p>
<p>Ireland, from week to week during the greater part
</p>
<p>of an entire year. He must be ready to meet every
</p>
<p>charge which may be preferred as to the acts done,
</p>
<p>and the speeches spoken at each and all of these as-
</p>
<p>semblies.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton  ^Is there an affidavit as to this ?
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan  No, my lord ; but we rely on the
</p>
<p>indictment, and on it these things appear. But
</p>
<p>further, it is remarkable that the defendant is not
</p>
<p>charged as liaving been present at a single one of
</p>
<p>this multitude of meetings out of the city of Dublin,
</p>
<p>and yet everything that occurred at every one of
</p>
<p>them which the prosecutor can possibly employ as
</p>
<p>founding or colouring the accusation will be imputed
</p>
<p>to him for crime.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Is not the charge against Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy that of publications in a newspaper ?
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan  The charge is one of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and all the meetings are made to affect all the de-
</p>
<p>fendants as overt acts. The publications are also
</p>
<p>made overt acts, and are laid in the same way against
</p>
<p>them all. So that the traverser may be required to

<p>meetings, held at distances of hundreds of miles,

</p>
<p>accused of offences against the law should be enabled
</p>
<p>to make full answer and defence to all tliat is alleged
</p>
<p>against them ;" and by that act the accused is en-
</p>
<p>titled to copies of the informations on which he has
</p>
<p>been held to bail. That act was passed deliberately,
</p>
<p>after long consideration, and notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>suggestion of many dreaded mischiefs, and it demon-
</p>
<p>strates the anxiety of Parliament to furnish all ne-
</p>
<p>cessary means of defence to traversers. Is it to be
</p>
<p>said that those who directed the informations to be
</p>
<p>given intended to refuse the names of the witnesses ?
</p>
<p>Can it be alleged that any reason capable of being
</p>
<p>urged for giving the informations will not authorise
</p>
<p>the giving of the names  and can the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral assert or imagine any objection to the giving the
</p>
<p>latter which will not more strongly apply to the giving
</p>
<p>of the former ? The act professes to afford opportu-
</p>
<p>nity of " full answer and defence" by enabling a
</p>
<p>traverser to learn the particidars of the evidence
</p>
<p>against him ; but, in this case, the informations in
</p>
<p>no ways disclose those particulars. They regard
</p>
<p>only two or three transactions out of scores on which
</p>
<p>the prosecutors intend to rely ; and can it be said
</p>
<p>that by looking at those informations the defendants
</p>
<p>have the means of full answer and defence intended
</p>
<p>by the act ? And if the great body of the evidence
</p>
<p>is not put in the informations, and is so concealed
</p>
<p>from them, is not the purpose of the statute thwarted,
</p>
<p>and will not the court be the more inclined to carry
</p>
<p>its spirit into action, by affording to them the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses, and thereby aiding tliem to make

<p>gislation, which, day by day, is extending the privi-
</p>
<p>leges of the accused and narrowing the harsh prero-
</p>
<p>gatives of the accuser ; but, in this case, the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General calls upon it absolutely to refuse a right
</p>
<p>which was practically enjoyed in Ireland until the
</p>
<p>passing of the 1st and 2d Vic, c. 37, and which is
</p>
<p>enjoyed in England at tliis moment by every man
</p>
<p>who will procui'e an oiBce copy of the indictment
</p>
<p>against him. Is it proper that, whilst Parliament is
</p>
<p>systematically extending the opportunities of full
</p>
<p>defence, the judges should be required to contract
</p>
<p>them ? Reason is with the motion ; the whole cur-
</p>
<p>rent of our later law is with it ; and what has oc-
</p>
<p>curred in the progress of this case exhibits some of
</p>
<p>the evils which must arise from a refusal of it. He
</p>
<p>(Mr. O'Hagan) would not now insist upon the ad-
</p>
<p>vantages which a traverser would derive from being
</p>
<p>enabled to object to an indictment, in the first in-
</p>
<p>stance, if found on unsworn testimony, or found on
</p>
<p>the testimony of a prosecutor being a member of the
</p>
<p>grand jury, or found without strict compliance with
</p>
<p>the terms of the act ; but to this he would advert,
</p>
<p>that their lordships had been called on to hold the
</p>
<p>plea in abatement of the defendant bad, because it
</p>
<p>did not state the names of the witnesses, or that they
</p>
<p>were unknown. The names could not be stated, be-
</p>
<p>cause, at the instance of the Crown, they had been
</p>
<p>refused to the traverser ; neither could' it be said
</p>
<p>that all the witnesses were unknown, for one of them
</p>
<p>was known, had sworn an information, and had been
</p>
<p>referred to specially by the learned j udge who charged
</p>
<p>the grand jury. No man could swear that all the
</p>
<p>witnesses were unknown  so that it was perfectly

<p>plain, that if the objection were good, the traverser

<p>that from his own knowledge, and from his own per-
</p>
<p>sonal experience, he can depose to the facts herein
</p>
<p>Bet forth and deposed to ; and this deponent maketh
</p>
<p>oath and saith, that in all cases of indictments for
</p>
<p>conspiracies or misdemeanours, the ofiice copy of
</p>
<p>every indictment supplied by the crown ofiice to
</p>
<p>any person applying for a copy of such indictment,
</p>
<p>contains the caption, and alo the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses examined before the grand jury on the find-
</p>
<p>ing of the said indictment ; and that, to the best of
</p>
<p>this deponent's knowledge, information, and belief,
</p>
<p>there never has been an instance in which the office
</p>
<p>copy of an indictment, supplied upon request to any
</p>
<p>defendant, or to his agent or solicitor, or to any
</p>
<p>person applying for the same before trial, and as
</p>
<p>soon as the same indictment could be obtained, did
</p>
<p>not contain the caption and the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses examined before the grand jury ; and depo-
</p>
<p>nent saith such practice is invariable, and is well
</p>
<p>known to be the usual and common practice in the
</p>
<p>crown office in England upon all indictments for
</p>
<p>conspiracies and misdemeanours."
</p>
<p>If that affidavit were true  if the practice in
</p>
<p>England were such as that affidavit described it 
</p>
<p>he (Mr. O'Hagan) confidently put it to the court
</p>
<p>that he was entitled to carry the motion. The

<p>cases to which he had referred, and office copies of

<p>statement of Mr. Coppock ; and, if an English tra-

<p>most requires, and is most entitled to the considera-

<p>tion of the court, in assisting him to prepare for his

<p>created between the countries in a matter of vital

<p>consequence to accused persons ? Should a prece-

<p>dent be now, for the first time, established, denying
</p>
<p>to them, in one district of the empire, the opportu-
</p>
<p>nities of defence which are enjoyed of right, and of
</p>
<p>course, in another ? Should a privilege which may

<p>continually avail to the prevention of injustice  
</p>
<p>which may enable the innocent man to confi'ont the
</p>
<p>perjured accuser, and rely on the infamy of that ac-

<p>having regard to the peculiar character and circum-

<p>stances of this prosecution, whether it be politic or

<p>upon to give evidence before the grand jury. Tliey
</p>
<p>were sworn in a corner of the court by the clerk of
</p>
<p>the crown ; the prisoners were in gaol, or the tra-
</p>
<p>versers were out on bail, and accordingly wlien the
</p>
<p>witnesses were sworn in open court no person knew
</p>
<p>with reference to what bill of indictment those wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were to be called upon to give evidence. It
</p>
<p>was a matter that was only in the knowledge of the
</p>
<p>clerk of the crown as to what particular case or in-
</p>
<p>dictment they were sworn to give evidence. Under
</p>
<p>those circumstances, as to its being suggested that
</p>
<p>the swearing of the witnesses in court aiforded the
</p>
<p>traversers a means of knowledge, he would not oc-
</p>
<p>cupy the time of the court by meeting such a pro-
</p>
<p>position as that ; and Mr. O'flagan himself must
</p>
<p>know if he reflected for a moment that not the slight-
</p>
<p>est information was given to the parties by the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of swearing witnesses in court. The 1st and 2d
</p>
<p>Victoria, therefore, did not deprive the party of a well
</p>
<p>known privilege, which was assumed to exist with-
</p>
<p>out the slightest foundation for supposing that it did
</p>
<p>ever exist, for he repeated that the swearing of the
</p>
<p>witnesses in court did not afford any knowledge
</p>
<p>with regard to what the witness would be called
</p>
<p>upon to give in evidence, so the attempt at endea-
</p>
<p>vouring to account for there being no practice in
</p>
<p>Ireland, on this assumption, that under the 56th
</p>
<p>Geo. III. the witnesses were known, could not be
</p>
<p>maintained. It was no part of the right of the pri-
</p>
<p>soner to know the evidence against him until the
</p>
<p>time of his trial, for if he did, and he was not now
</p>
<p>speaking of this case, it might lead to consequences
</p>
<p>of the most dangerous character to the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of justice. The suggestion made on the other

</p>
<p>names of the ivitnesses at the time of the trial, he
</p>
<p>should be furnished with them at an earlier period.
</p>
<p>But it was a different thing to give them to the tra-

</p>
<p>period, for if they were given before the trial many
</p>
<p>dangers might occur to prevent any opportunity of
</p>
<p>carrying their evidence into effect. Having ad-
</p>
<p>verted to the authorities cited by Mr. O'Hagan, and
</p>
<p>to a passage in a judgment of Judge Butler, 4 Term
</p>
<p>Reports, 694, to sustain the proposition that a de-
</p>
<p>fendant was not entitled to inspect the evidence
</p>
<p>until the hour of trial, he called the attention'of the
</p>
<p>court to a matter reUed upon, on the argument of
</p>
<p>the plea in abatement, that the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were not known to the traversers. But on
</p>
<p>that occasion particular attention was caUed to the
</p>
<p>fact, that the traversers had not sworn that they did
</p>
<p>not know the names of the witnesses, and there was
</p>
<p>no affidavit on the present application that they did
</p>
<p>not know the names of every one of the witnesses.
</p>
<p>With the exception of James Coppock's aflBdavit,
</p>
<p>who took upon himself to state the practice of the
</p>
<p>Court of Queen's Bench in England, which he sub-
</p>
<p>mitted was not to be known by such an affidavit,
</p>
<p> but by a certificate from the Crown Office in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, the only other affidavit made on the present
</p>
<p>application was that of the attorney of Mr. Duffy,
</p>
<p>who only said the copy of the names was essential
</p>
<p>for the defence of the traverser, but he did not state
</p>
<p>- how it was essential, or a single circumstance in or-
</p>
<p>der to show it was necessary he should have those
</p>
<p>names, and yet he called upon the court to make a
</p>
<p>precedent in the case of the traverser, Charles Gavan

</p>
<p>tnent should be amended, being an imperfect docu-
</p>
<p>ment i add this was a motion for a copy of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses' names. This application was founded here
</p>
<p>on the nature of the indictment, the character of the
</p>
<p>case, and the complexity of the case ; all this was
</p>
<p>familiar to the mind of the court, and a repetition
</p>
<p>of it on his part could only lessen the force of the
</p>
<p>observations of his learned friend, Mr. O'Hagan.
</p>
<p>He rested his application on this ground, that it was
</p>
<p>the admitted practice in England to give a copy of
</p>
<p>the names of the witnesses to the accused, and no
</p>
<p>authority was cited  no affidavit was made contro-
</p>
<p>verting a single fact that was mentioned there in
</p>
<p>support of this application ; and though suggestions
</p>
<p>had been thrown out to the mind of the court, they
</p>
<p>should not affect the case, or induce the court to
</p>
<p>give a judgment here whicli in no court in England
</p>
<p>would be delivered, and which the whole practice
</p>
<p>there would contradict. They mi^ht have served
</p>
<p>eight or nine notices if they wislied to do so ; but
</p>
<p>they conceived it was tlie lionest way for the per-
</p>
<p>son who made the former application to bring it be-
</p>
<p>fore the court again, and it was stated that the mat-
</p>
<p>ter sought for was essential to his defence. He ob-
</p>
<p>jected to the mode of debating this case on the part
</p>
<p>of the crown, or to a hypothetical case being put
</p>
<p>forward without a single fact being sworn to by the
</p>
<p>crown solicitor. If it were sworn that they wanted
</p>
<p>to make an unworthy use of those names, it should
</p>
<p>of course have great weight with the court; but
</p>
<p>the fact that they got no person to make that affi-
</p>
<p>davit should have great weight in his favour ; and
</p>
<p>however worthy of respect the assertion of the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General might be, that assertion should not
</p>
<p>be taken to over-master the distinct affidavit on

<p>which they relied. He respectfully submitted that
</p>
<p>the honesty of this appUcation must be plain to
</p>
<p>every understanding ; it was sworn that the copy of
</p>
<p>the names was essential for the defence of the tra-
</p>
<p>verser, and the nature of the charges in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment should form an Irresistible argument in favour
</p>
<p>of the soundness and honesty of their application.
</p>
<p>He relied upon the fact that when the crown got no-
</p>
<p>tice of bringing forward this application they should
</p>
<p>have inquired and ascertained if they could get affi-
</p>
<p>davits contradicting the facts that they could bring
</p>
<p>forward in support of it. What law were their
</p>
<p>lordships administering in that court but the law of
</p>
<p>England ? and it would be calculated to startle any
</p>
<p>man, if an accused person were to be prosecuted by
</p>
<p>one law in England and by another law in this
</p>
<p>country. The Attorney -General had handed up a
</p>
<p>letter the other day, stating what was the practice
</p>
<p>in a particular Case in England, and he (Mr. W.)
</p>
<p>would take the same course now, and hand up a
</p>
<p>letter stating the practice in England on this sub-
</p>
<p>ject, and he would also hand up a document show-
</p>
<p>ing what tlie practice was there, and that the prac-
</p>
<p>tice was to give a copy of the names.

<p>the document, obsernng it is an Unreported case,
</p>
<p>and therefore fklls exactly within the principle
</p>
<p>which the Attorney-General relied upon.

</p>
<p>bj any pefson when going to be examined the pre-
</p>
<p>sent application would not have been made. He
</p>
<p>Bubmitted that the application ought to be granted.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General replied. He said Mr. White-
</p>
<p>side had very vehemently disclaimed the imputation
</p>
<p>that the object of the present motion was to reagi-
</p>
<p>tate the discussion that had taken place on the former
</p>
<p>motion for the defendant to get the names of the
</p>
<p>witnesses on the back of the indictment ; but as-
</p>
<p>suming that the present application was bona fide
</p>
<p>distinct from that which had been already decided,
</p>
<p>they should see what the question was and how it
</p>
<p>had been argued. He took the question to be neither
</p>
<p>more nor less than this  whether after an indictment
</p>
<p>is found, the prisoner or defendant is entitled to
</p>
<p>have for the purposes of his defence a list of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses endorsed on the bill of indictment, and that
</p>
<p>independent of legislative enactment and by the
</p>
<p>rules of the common law. That, he contended, or
</p>
<p>nothing short of it, was the argument submitted on
</p>
<p>the other side, but with great respect for his learned
</p>
<p>friends, he should utterly deny that such was the
</p>
<p>law at any time, either in England or Ireland.
</p>
<p>There was no authority, no argument, no sentence
</p>
<p>from any text writer cited to support such a propo-
</p>
<p>sition as that'put forward by the other side. It was
</p>
<p>therefore an attempt to introduce into the law of
</p>
<p>this country a new practice, but before the court
</p>
<p>would be ancillary to the introduction of such a
</p>
<p>practice, it would not be immaterial to reflect on the
</p>
<p>consequences that might follow from it. If the
</p>
<p>names of witnesses were to be always given after the
</p>
<p>Indictment was formed, it might happen that wit-
</p>
<p>nesses would be tampered with, taken away, or de-

<p>prived of Ufe. He was not assuming the existence
</p>
<p>of any such circumstance in the present case, but he
</p>
<p>had a right to use it as an argument, especially as
</p>
<p>he found it stated in the 56th George III., c. 87,
</p>
<p>that witnesses were often murdered or disabled from
</p>
<p>attending, or tampered with, and provision was ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly made for putting a stop to such practices.
</p>
<p>It was said that this was a peculiar case, but it was
</p>
<p>contended that the defendants had a right to the
</p>
<p>application, independent of any discretion in the
</p>
<p>case. But it was impossible the court could see the
</p>
<p>existence of any such necessity in the case before
</p>
<p>the court. Mr. Duffy was charged as one of the par-
</p>
<p>ties implicated, but it was not charged that he had
</p>
<p>been present at any meeting out of DubUn, and the
</p>
<p>meetings with which he was charged with being pre-
</p>
<p>sent at in Dublin were distinctly pointed out and
</p>
<p>brought before him. The singlar argument of Mr.
</p>
<p>Whiteside was, that in the English case, when the
</p>
<p>defendant applied for the addresses of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>ergo he knew the names already, but admitting that
</p>
<p>some how or other, as Mr. O'Hagan had said he had
</p>
<p>got the names, it might be said that " some how or
</p>
<p>other" they might have got the names of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses here, for neither on this or any other occasion
</p>
<p>was that denied. They then cited the act of the 6th
</p>
<p>and 7th WilUam IV., chap. 1 14, but that act showed
</p>
<p>that by the common law they would not have a right
</p>
<p>to get copies of the informations. There was a prac-
</p>
<p>tice long antecedent to the 56th Geo. lU., and they
</p>
<p>did not show what that practice was, and if a right
</p>
<p>of the kind contended for existed, some single in-
</p>
<p>stance would be found either in England or in Ire-
</p>
<p>land in which it had come before the court. He

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>committed, and did exist on the part of the counsel
</p>
<p>of the traverser. It was advanced generally, and as
</p>
<p>applicable to all oases. Now, though there might
</p>
<p>be a principle applicable to all cases, that it was de-
</p>
<p>Birable that the parties accused of criminal offences
</p>
<p>should have every due and fair means afforded them
</p>
<p>of preparing for their defence against the charge on
</p>
<p>which they were arraigned, and though that prin-
</p>
<p>ciple applied in all its length and extent to the cases
</p>
<p>of felonies, as well as to cases of misdemeanour, yet
</p>
<p>it was not attempted to be argued, that it ever was
</p>
<p>heard of, that the rule was applied to cases of felony ;
</p>
<p>and he would say, considering the rule iu itself,
</p>
<p>that if there be a distinction to be taken between the
</p>
<p>application to felonies and misdemeanours of such
</p>
<p>a rule, it ought to be applied more favourably
</p>
<p>towards persons accused of the greatest offence than
</p>
<p>in favour of persons accused only of lighter crimes.
</p>
<p>But it was, and must be conceded, that there was
</p>
<p>no instance ever known in history from its beginning
</p>
<p>until now, of that having been a principle applica-
</p>
<p>ble to cases of felony. But it was said that it was
</p>
<p>applicable to cases of treason, and that by analogy
</p>
<p>to cases of treason the rule ought to be extended to
</p>
<p>cases of misdemeanour. He took that also not to
</p>
<p>be the law. If there was an analogy to be applied
</p>
<p>between cases of treason and misdemeanour, he
</p>
<p>would be glad to know on what principle it was that
</p>
<p>it was not equally applied from treasons to felonies,
</p>
<p>and he repeated again, that it had never been applied
</p>
<p>to cases of felony, nor could it be argued that it
</p>
<p>ought to be 60. What was the law as applicable to
</p>
<p>cases of treason ? He begged to say they were cases
</p>
<p>sui generis, and they were not to be brought under

<p>the consideration of the court, as governing the cases
</p>
<p>of misdemeanours at all, and though in its mercy
</p>
<p>the law had extended privileges to persons on trial
</p>
<p>for their lives, and liberties, and properties, as per-
</p>
<p>sons were who were accused of high treason, in con-
</p>
<p>sideration of the dreadful penalty that attached to
</p>
<p>them if they were found guilty, there was not any
</p>
<p>one of the same principles of application referrable
</p>
<p>to felonies as there was to high treason. He would
</p>
<p>consider the case of treason. As the law originally
</p>
<p>stood in cases of treason, the parties accused had no
</p>
<p>right to a copy of the names of the witnesses against
</p>
<p>them. Neither had they a right originally to a copy
</p>
<p>of the indictment. But by the statute of treason the
</p>
<p>statute of William  it was enacted, that from
</p>
<p>thenceforward, persons accused of treason of a cer-
</p>
<p>tain nature, involving the crown's dignity, should,
</p>
<p>in consideration of the dreadful penalty which had
</p>
<p>been inflicted upon them if they were found guilty,
</p>
<p>and in tender consideration of that, be furnished
</p>
<p>with a copy of the indictment against them, but
</p>
<p>making a reservation at the same time" but not
</p>
<p>a copy of the names of the witnesses." So that in
</p>
<p>no case up to that time was the accused party, whe-
</p>
<p>ther accused of treason, or felony, or of misdemea-
</p>
<p>nour, entitled at the common law to be furnished
</p>
<p>with a list of the witnesses against him. There was
</p>
<p>not in the statute of treason that wliich had been
</p>
<p>brought forward as showing that by analogy it ought
</p>
<p>to govern the present case, but there was in the
</p>
<p>statute of treason that which appeared to him to
</p>
<p>form a strong argument the other way. It was not
</p>
<p>actually silent with regard to furnishing the list of
</p>
<p>witnesses, but furnishing the list of witnesses was
</p>
<p>APPLICATION FOR THE CAPTION.
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>because, said Mr. O'Hagan, it was tlien only,
</p>
<p>and for tiie first time, that the Law made it
</p>
<p>clear that the witnesses that were to be exa-
</p>
<p>mined before the grand jury were to be sworn
</p>
<p>in open court, and inasmuch as the parties had
</p>
<p>an opportunity of knowing who the parties were
</p>
<p>that were sworn in open court, the accused per-
</p>
<p>sons did not require since that time to he furnished
</p>
<p>with the names of the witnesses. Mr. O'Hagan's
</p>
<p>argument was that thereby the parties accused ac-
</p>
<p>quired the privilege which they did not before pos-
</p>
<p>sess ; they acquired the privilege of being able to
</p>
<p>become acquainted with the names of the witnesses
</p>
<p>who were to be examined against them, and that
</p>
<p>they were deprived of that privilege by the opera-
</p>
<p>tion of the 1st and 2nd Victoria, whereby it was
</p>
<p>enacted that the practice of sweailng the witnesses
</p>
<p>in open court should be discontinued, and that the
</p>
<p>witnesses should be sworn before the grand jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan's argument was that, in the period
</p>
<p>between the passing of the act of the 56th Geo. III.,
</p>
<p>and the act of the 1st and 2nd Victoria, accused per-
</p>
<p>sons did not want to be furnished with the names
</p>
<p>of witnesses, and that, therefore, there was no need
</p>
<p>of any such application here, and Mr. Whiteside
</p>
<p>treated, rather with ridicule, the observation of the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General on the subject, as if, in point of
</p>
<p>fact, he was rather overdrawing the manner in
</p>
<p>which witnesses were sworn in open court, and the
</p>
<p>nature of the advantages which the accused party
</p>
<p>derived from it. He did not think it necessary to
</p>
<p>consider whether there was an exact statement or
</p>
<p>misrepresentation made of tlie manner in which the
</p>
<p>oath was accustomed to be administered ; or on the

<p>other hand of the advantages and privileges which
</p>
<p>the accused derived under the system ; but he
</p>
<p>thought it very likely that neither one or the other
</p>
<p>was a correct statement of what took place. But
</p>
<p>supposing the advantages to go to the extent con-
</p>
<p>tended for by Mr. O'Hagan, did it necessarily fol-
</p>
<p>low that there was no rule for the existence of a
</p>
<p>practice in this case before the year 1816? Up to
</p>
<p>that time the parties had not the means of being
</p>
<p>furnished with the accusers' names by seeing them
</p>
<p>sworn in court before him, because the practice in
</p>
<p>this country, as recited in the act of parliament,
</p>
<p>was to find the bills of indictment without the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses being examined before the grand jury. If
</p>
<p>such were the case, how did it happen that up to
</p>
<p>1816 no person accused of misdemeanour required
</p>
<p>to be informed of the names of the witnesses against
</p>
<p>him unless it was that there was no such practice
</p>
<p>existing in this country. But if such a practice did
</p>
<p>exist, he did not see why it should exist beyond that
</p>
<p>allowed in cases of high treason, where the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses' names werA furnished, but not until within
</p>
<p>ten days of the trial ; and the cases cited from the
</p>
<p>8th and 9th Carrington and Payne did not show the
</p>
<p>existence of such a rule as was contended for, as
</p>
<p>they only went to this, that at the trial when there
</p>
<p>was no longer any danger resulting from the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses being known, if a case be made to the satis-
</p>
<p>faction of the judge, that the attainment of justice
</p>
<p>would require that the absent witnesses should be
</p>
<p>called if any witnesses were mentioned on the back
</p>
<p>of the indictment  the judge having power to have
</p>
<p>that indictment laid before him, he could make an

</p>
<p>reasons, but they were grounds entirely in confir-
</p>
<p>mation of the reasons that tiie Lord Chief Justice
</p>
<p>had given. He then entered at some length into
</p>
<p>the arguments put forward by the Chief Justice,
</p>
<p>and spid tliat it was his opinion it was desirable
</p>
<p>that the accused should have some time before the
</p>
<p>trial a list of the witnesses who weie examined be-
</p>
<p>fore the grand jury, and those who were likely to
</p>
<p>be examined before the petty jury who were to try
</p>
<p>him, in order that he might be the better able to
</p>
<p>prepare for his defence. He would thus be enabled
</p>
<p>to know what witnesses it would be necessary for
</p>
<p>him to summon, as he might otherwise summon
</p>
<p>some of the very witnesses who were to be examined
</p>
<p>against him. ,He considered it reasonable that the
</p>
<p>traverser should therefore have a list of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses to be examined against him a reasonable time
</p>
<p>before the trial, but he considered that very distant
</p>
<p>from the present motion which was in effect, that
</p>
<p>any time after the bill was found by the grand jury,
</p>
<p>the traverser had a right to the witnesses' names on
</p>
<p>the bill at the same moment that he is entitled to a
</p>
<p>copy of the indictment. He was very forcibly
</p>
<p>struck with the argument that mischiefs might re-
</p>
<p>sult if such a practice as that contended for were
</p>
<p>established, and from the nature of the crime and
</p>
<p>the peculiar circumstances attending it in the pre-
</p>
<p>sent case, as well as from the situation of the coun-
</p>
<p>try, it was possible that if the names of the witnesses
</p>
<p>were furnished so long before the trial, it would be
</p>
<p>attended with very considerable risk to the ends of
</p>
<p>justice. He did not think, under all the circum-
</p>
<p>stances, that it was incumbent on the court to com-
</p>
<p>ply with the application at the present time, what-

</p>
<p>ever they might do at any future application of the
</p>
<p>same kind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton said at that late hour he
</p>
<p>would feel himself not at all warranted in saying
</p>
<p>more than that he concurred in opinion with the
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice, were it not that one of the
</p>
<p>members of the court differed from the majority in a
</p>
<p>point of considerable importance. The application
</p>
<p>was made full seven weeks before the day fixed for
</p>
<p>the trial. It should be grounded either on a right
</p>
<p>possessed by the traversers, or on grounds on which
</p>
<p>the court should be called on to exercise a discretion
</p>
<p>vested in it. He would say nothing with respect to
</p>
<p>the former motion being substantially the same as
</p>
<p>the present, but he held that neither by statute law
</p>
<p>nor by common law had the traversers such a right.
</p>
<p>The traverser called on the court to make an order,
</p>
<p>changing the practice in criminal proceedings, and
</p>
<p>they were told to do that on what was alleged to be
</p>
<p>the English practice. He would say it had not been
</p>
<p>shown to be the English practice, and even if it had
</p>
<p>been so shown that would make no change in his
</p>
<p>opinion. If such a practice did exist in England,
</p>
<p>it appeared to have been never brought under the
</p>
<p>attention of the court there, and they had on the

<p>a practice never did exist in Ireland. After going
</p>
<p>over the same ground dwelt on by the Chief Jus-
</p>
<p>tice, on that part of the case, he said that another
</p>
<p>ground on which the matter had been put was to the
</p>
<p>discretion of the court, and he confessed if proper
</p>
<p>grounds had been stated to the court by aflidavit of
</p>
<p>the party, or possibly of the attorney calling on the
</p>
<p>court at the proper time, he would be disposed to

</p>
<p>sion it Was necessary for him to make for the pre-
</p>
<p>sence of other -vritnesses to support his case ; but it
</p>
<p>was not necessary to go through the instances in
</p>
<p>which it may or may not be essential for the tra-
</p>
<p>verser to know the names of the \ritnesses tliat are
</p>
<p>to be produced against him, because in the present
</p>
<p>case the person who, above all other persons, was
</p>
<p>qualified to form and express an opinion on the mat-
</p>
<p>ter, namely, the traverser's attorney, had distinctly
</p>
<p>sworn that it was, according to his belief, essential
</p>
<p>to the defence of the traverser that he should be
</p>
<p>apprized of those names. He was surprised that it
</p>
<p>should have been suggested as an. objection to the
</p>
<p>motion, that the party had not made an affidavit ex-
</p>
<p>pressly stating that the names of the witnesses were
</p>
<p>unknown. He could not conceive how any gentle-
</p>
<p>man of respectability or veracity could swear that
</p>
<p>it was essential that his client should be furnished
</p>
<p>with the names of the witnesses, if he were at the
</p>
<p>time couscious that his client knew those names al-
</p>
<p>ready. He took it that the statement in the affida-
</p>
<p>vit that it was essential for the defence of the tra-
</p>
<p>verser that he should be apprised of the names of
</p>
<p>the witnesses against him, involved to every well
</p>
<p>constituted mind a distinct denial that he did know
</p>
<p>those names at the time, because if the fact were
</p>
<p>that he did know them at the time, the furnishing
</p>
<p>of them to laim could not be essential for his defence,
</p>
<p>and the affidavit would, therefore, in his mind be di-
</p>
<p>rect, downright false swearing. He could perceive
</p>
<p>no very sound or fair objection to the disclosure of
</p>
<p>the names of the witnesses, nor had any good rea-
</p>
<p>son been given to satisfy liis mind that it was desir-
</p>
<p>able those witnesses' names should be suppressed or

</p>
<p>concealed. There was no general or special reason
</p>
<p>suggested bearing on that particular case why the
</p>
<p>names should not be given. He wished at that late
</p>
<p>hour of the last day of the Term to be as brief as
</p>
<p>possible in his observations, and he would, therefore,
</p>
<p>do little more than refer to the reasons that in-
</p>
<p>fluenced his opinion. He before adverted to the
</p>
<p>eflfect of the 6th and 7th WiQiam IV., ch. 114, and
</p>
<p>he would not dwell upon it then. But not merely
</p>
<p>was there no objection in principle to the motion,
</p>
<p>but no inconvenience had been pointed out as likely
</p>
<p>to arise in this particular case from furnishing the
</p>
<p>names of the witnesses. Under the statute, the
</p>
<p>traverser is entitled to the depositions of all wit-
</p>
<p>nesses who have been sworn before he was held to
</p>
<p>bail, and if the law required tliat he should have
</p>
<p>these, he (Judge Perrin) was yet unapprised of any
</p>
<p>inconvenience that would follow from furnishing
</p>
<p>him with the names endorsed on the indictment.
</p>
<p>It appeared to him that the fact of the traverser
</p>
<p>having got the informations, furnished an addi-
</p>
<p>tional reason why he should get the names on the
</p>
<p>indictment, in order that he might know whe-
</p>
<p>ther it was likely additional proof had been given
</p>
<p>before the grand jury against him. There ap-
</p>
<p>peared to be no sound objection to such a course
</p>
<p>being taken. The court on the preceding day fixed
</p>
<p>the trial to take place on the first Monday in the
</p>
<p>next term, and they did that on due consideration
</p>
<p>of the affidavits that had been brought before them,
</p>
<p>and of what they regarded as a fit time for the tra-
</p>
<p>versers to prepare for their defence, taking also into
</p>
<p>consideration the important circumstances as to the
</p>
<p>Stale of the jury book. Having done so, it ap-

<p>trial. It would be recollected that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General's motion was that the trial should be fixed
</p>
<p>for the 1 1th December, and they were now content,
</p>
<p>the trial being fixed for the 15th of January, if their
</p>
<p>lordships would give them an order to get the list
</p>
<p>of witnesses ten days before the trial  say the 5th
</p>
<p>of January.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General resisted this proposition,
</p>
<p>on the grounds that it would be introducing a new
</p>
<p>practice here, and as the court had refused the mo-
</p>
<p>tion made on the part of the traverser, he would
</p>
<p>stand on that decision.
</p>
<p>APPLICATION FOB A SPECIAL JURY.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly moved on the part of the crown for an
</p>
<p>order to strike a special jury in this case  such
</p>
<p>order not to be acted upon of course until the new
</p>
<p>jury list was made out.
</p>
<p>Application granted.
</p>
<p>[The case was no more heard of in court until the
</p>
<p>enduing Hilary Term.]
</p>
<p>Cotemporaneously with a large portion of those
</p>
<p>proceedings, which almost exclusively occupied the
</p>
<p>Queen's Courts even during the month of Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, there was another process of law bearing very
</p>
<p>largely upon the issue, in the case before the Recor-
</p>
<p>der's Court in Green-street. This was the revision
</p>
<p>of the jury lists for the year 1844, which the law
</p>
<p>fixed to take place at the sitting of the City Sessions
</p>
<p>in November. This year the proceedings com-
</p>
<p>menced upon the 14th of that month, and excited
</p>
<p>for several days more attention than even the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings in the Queen's Bench.

<p>cupying houses of the value of 20?. a-year and
</p>
<p>upwards, are entitled to act as jurors. The col-
</p>
<p>lectors of grand jury cess are bound to make re-
</p>
<p>turns of those parties, and the Recorder, when pre-
</p>
<p>siding at sessions in November, is directed to in-
</p>
<p>quire into those returns, and to place upon the
</p>
<p>jurors' book the names of those who shall be found
</p>
<p>qualified, unless some reason to the contrary be
</p>
<p>shown. For many reasons the cess collectors quite
</p>
<p>neglected this duty, and the Recorder on the open-
</p>
<p>ing of the sessions declared that he had frequently
</p>
<p>regretted the way in which this important portion
</p>
<p>of the public business was neglected, and pro-
</p>
<p>nounced the then existing lists to be filled with
</p>
<p>errors and inaccuracies. He stated that the infor-
</p>
<p>mation necessary to enable him to adjiidicate had
</p>
<p>never been supplied, and expressed his pleasure
</p>
<p>that on that occasion he should have that informa-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Impressed as well with the importance of the
</p>
<p>matter to the proper dispensation of public justice,
</p>
<p>as with the fact which the Recorder was free to ac-
</p>
<p>knowledge, the solicitors for the traversers had
</p>
<p>made preparations to effect the correction and ar-
</p>
<p>rangement of the jury pannel. Many names had to
</p>
<p>be removed which ought not to be on the pannel,
</p>
<p>thousands had to be added which ought to have
</p>
<p>been there and were not.
</p>
<p>Besides, the lists of special jurors which were at
</p>
<p>the same time to be arranged, were still more im-
</p>
<p>perfect, to use no stronger phrase, than those of the
</p>
<p>common jury. Those special jurors' lists include
</p>
<p>the names of peers, eldest sons of baronets, and their
</p>

<p>of whatever they believed might be material to the

</p>
<p>DEATH OF THE REV. MR. TTBRELL.
</p>
<p>But previous to this period an incident occurred
</p>
<p>which created at that time a very deep sensation
</p>
<p>throughout Ireland. This was the premature and
</p>
<p>all but sudden death of the Kev. Peter James Tyr-
</p>
<p>rell, P.P., Lusk, one of the indicted conspirators.
</p>
<p>The rev. gentleman had made great exertions on
</p>
<p>the night of the 7th October, for the purpose of pre-
</p>
<p>venting the people in his neighbourhood, who had
</p>
<p>all prepared to go there, from proceeding to Clontarf
</p>
<p>on the day appointed for the meeting, Sunday, Oc-
</p>
<p>tober 8th. He never slept on that night ; much rain
</p>
<p>fell, his clothes, as he rode on horseback from one
</p>
<p>portion of the country in his neighbourhood to an-
</p>
<p>ther, became quite saturated, and the rev. gentle-
</p>
<p>man took ill m consequence.
</p>
<p>However, the excitement day after day recurring
</p>
<p> kept up his system, and, though a man of delicate
</p>
<p>constitution, he took no precaution against the con-
</p>
<p>sequences. But after the proceedings of the Novem-
</p>
<p>ber term had concluded, the stimulus of intense
</p>
<p>anxiety which they had supplied having been re-
</p>
<p>moved, and having returned to the tranquillity of
</p>
<p>liis home, he sunk rapidly, and on Monday, the 4th
</p>
<p>December, 1843, his spirit departed to another
</p>
<p>world. His death was produced immediately by
</p>
<p>severe erysipelas, brought on by neglected cold and
</p>
<p>continued anxiety ; but the physician who attended
</p>
<p>on him at his death declared it as his opinion that it
</p>
<p>was the indictment did it all ! In point of fact, though
</p>
<p>the rev. gentleman died in the full possession of his

</p>
<p>faculties, yet a few moments before he breathed his
</p>
<p>last, his miiid wandered to the subject which had
</p>
<p>produced liis death-sickness, and he made a feehng
</p>
<p>but firm appeal to the court, before which he must
</p>
<p>have felt persuaded he was then standing, upon the
</p>
<p>harshness of the proceedings to which he had been
</p>
<p>subjected.
</p>
<p>It is a strange incident in the history of the Rev.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tyrrell, that previous to the French Revolution
</p>
<p>of 1830, he was a parish priest in Brittany, and that
</p>
<p>he fled from France through horror at a revolution ;
</p>
<p>yet that man was persecuted to death in his own
</p>
<p>country for his supposed conspiracy to produce a
</p>
<p>revolution here! How strange are the events of
</p>
<p>man's hfe  ^how strange his fortunes 1 No man who
</p>
<p>knew Mr. Tyrrell or his history would beheve the
</p>
<p>accusation made against him. No man can doubt
</p>
<p>that had he lived he would have been pronounced
</p>
<p>guilty of the charge.
</p>
<p>The remains of the rev. gentleman were honoured
</p>
<p>with a public funeral by the Repealers of the metro-
</p>
<p>polis and its neighbourhood, and the Repeal Asso-
</p>
<p>ciation with great consideration made provision for
</p>
<p>the latter days of the father of the rev. gentleman,
</p>
<p>who survived him. Mr. TyrreU died as poor as a
</p>
<p>Christian missionary ought.
</p>
<p>The following account, which we extract from the
</p>
<p>Freeman's Journal of December 8, will be found not
</p>
<p>uninteresting : 
</p>
<p>It is but necessary to add that in his parting mo-
</p>
<p>ments, when mental and bodily sufl'ering had tri-
</p>
<p>umphed over reason, and when the cold hand of death
</p>
<p>was pressing upon his faculties, his ravings were of
</p>
<p>the indictment and of the recent scenes in the
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Government manifested a vileness which, we believe
</p>
<p>and hope, was never equalled in this world. The
</p>
<p>demand was openly made that proo/ should be given
</p>
<p>of the death of the rev. gentleman  legal proof, and
</p>
<p>they demanded that an inquest should be held upon
</p>
<p>the body.
</p>
<p>Now the death of the rev. gentleman was in no
</p>
<p>way unexpected ; he was attended by physicians,
</p>
<p>waited on by friends, and because he was charged
</p>
<p>to have been guilty of a conspiracy against the au-
</p>
<p>thorities, the atrocious doctrine was contended for
</p>
<p>and published to the world that his clay should be
</p>
<p>subjected to the indignity of the imprisoned felon or
</p>
<p>the suicide.

<p>STATE PROSECUTIONS,
</p>
<p>JANUARY, 1844.
</p>
<p>QUEEN'S BENCHCROWN OFFICE,
</p>
<p>Wednesday, Janctary 3.
</p>
<p>On this day, shortly before 12 o'clock Mr. Brew-
</p>
<p>ster, Q.C., and Mr. Kemmis, Crown Solicitor, at-
</p>
<p>tended on the part of the crown, in Mr. Bourne's

<p>Mr. Whiteside, Q.C., and Mr. Close, attended as

<p>as agents for the traversers, in pursuance of notice
</p>
<p>to that effect.

</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside, Q.C. on the behalf of the tra-

<p>traversers said:  Before the business of the ballot
</p>
<p>was entered upon, he had to make an application
</p>
<p>that the ballotting for the jury should not then be

<p>proper and expedient. The facts and circumstances
</p>
<p>on which this ajaplication was founded demonstrated
</p>
<p>its perfect fairness. In fact, it could not, in any
</p>
<p>point of view, be refused or resisted. The statute
</p>
<p>under which they were proceeding gave to the par-
</p>
<p>ties the right of maldng to any person, whose name
</p>
<p>should turn up in the course of the ballot, any pro-
</p>
<p>per objection which could be urged against any such
</p>
<p>person acting as a juror in the case. It further ena-
</p>
<p>bled the parties to support and prove that objection
</p>
<p>by evidence, of wliich evidence the clerk of the
</p>
<p>crown was the judge. But what was the fact ?
</p>
<p>Up to that moment the parties had not seen the
</p>
<p>pannel, and they were refused a copy of it. How,
</p>
<p>then, could the parties come prepared with their ob-
</p>
<p>jections when they did not know the names of the
</p>
<p>persons on the pannel ? The sheriff did not get the
</p>
<p>jurors' book until the 29th of December last, yet the
</p>
<p>summonses upon wliich they were now about to
</p>
<p>proceed had been issued on the 28th of that month,
</p>
<p>being a day before the jurors' book was handed to
</p>
<p>the sheriff, and a number of days before the special
</p>
<p>jury pannel was even in existence. It was expected by
</p>
<p>the parties that the summonses would not have been
</p>
<p>issued until the pannel was in existence. A party is
</p>
<p>entitled to at least five daj's' notice of such a pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding as the present. Indeed under the statute it
</p>
<p>is doubtful if the time be not six days, and he was
</p>
<p>instructed to state that Mr. Smyly, in applying on
</p>
<p>the part of the crown for the order to strike thejury,
</p>
<p>said nothing should be done upon it until the 6th of
</p>
<p>January.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne (Clerk of the Crown)  He did not
</p>
<p>say any such thing.

<p>THE JURY BALLOT.
</p>
<p>95
</p>
<p>copies of the pannel would be made out in time for
</p>
<p>to-morrow.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside having asked the high sheriff if he
</p>
<p>would give the pannel,
</p>
<p>Mr. Latouche came forward to the table, and said
</p>
<p>his whole anxiety was to do his duty with perfect
</p>
<p>fairness to all the parties. With that feeling he had
</p>
<p>resolved on not giving a copy of the pannel to one
</p>
<p>party without the consent of the other. It was not
</p>
<p>his province to construe but to obey an act of par-
</p>
<p>liament, and the statute in question did not direct
</p>
<p>him to give a copy of the pannel to any party, but
</p>
<p>he was quite willing to give a copy to the traversers
</p>
<p>if the crown consented to his doing so.
</p>
<p>After a deal of conversational discussion, the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings terminated by the summons being post-
</p>
<p>poned with the consent of Mr. Brewster until twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock the following day, the cvown and traversers

</p>
<p>purpose it was arranged that the sub-sheriff should
</p>
<p>read out the pannel, and that the crown solicitor
</p>
<p>and Mr. Cantwell should take copies of it as read.
</p>
<p>The pannel contaius 717 names, with residences
</p>
<p>and additions, and the copying of it in the manner
</p>
<p>described occupied from two o'clock in the day un-
</p>
<p>til half-past eight o'clock in the evening.

</p>
<p>mau to act for the traverser, Mr. John O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne at first refused to consent to this, being
</p>
<p>inclined to exclude reporters, until it was made
</p>
<p>known to him that the government had a note-taker
</p>
<p>in the office. Him he did not attempt to exclude
</p>
<p>or object to, and then he admitted one other for one
</p>
<p>traverser.
</p>
<p>The agents for Mr. O'Connell, for Dr. Gray, and
</p>
<p>others, Messrs. Ford and Cantwell, insisted on their
</p>
<p>right to have short-hand writers present but in vain.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne would not admit any others.
</p>
<p>It will be seen from the following account of what
</p>
<p>occurred in the office on tliat occasion, tliat the tra-
</p>
<p>versers were then for the first time made aware of
</p>
<p>the errors and omissions in the special jury pannel.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside, Q.C., then rose and said he wished
</p>
<p>to call the attention of the officer to a matter of so
</p>
<p>much importance, that he doubted not he would
</p>
<p>admit they could not proceed witli the case for the
</p>
<p>present. There was a fact of which the agents for
</p>
<p>the traversers became aware for the first time yes-
</p>
<p>terday evening. At an advanced hour they re-
</p>
<p>ceived a copy of the special pannel from wliich the
</p>
<p>jury in this case was to be struck, and on looking
</p>
<p>through it they had discovered that by some most
</p>
<p>extraordinary and unaccountable mistake the names
</p>
<p>of a large portion of the public who were entered
</p>
<p>on the jurors' book as qualified to act as special ju-
</p>
<p>rors had been omitted from the special list. They
</p>
<p>had in a very short time discovered the names of
</p>
<p>no less than sixty-five persons which had been ad-
</p>
<p>judicated upon by the Recorder, and entered in
</p>
<p>the common jury-book as special jurors, altogether

<p>to do so, but whether from accident or design, the

<p>before, accompanied with tlie notes to eacli name,
</p>
<p>describing tiie religion and political opinions of the
</p>
<p>individuals.]
</p>
<p>On entering into the business of the day, Mr.
</p>
<p>Mahony handed in a protest against proceeding
</p>
<p>further until the jury lists should be amended by
</p>
<p>the insertion of the missing names, and for other
</p>
<p>legal reasons, and he refused to be a party to any
</p>
<p>further proceedings in that regard. Mr. Mahony
</p>
<p>said :  I am prepared, sir, with the affidavits of the
</p>
<p>individuals concerned  some of ivhom are ready to
</p>
<p>be produced  and who will prove that they were
</p>
<p>entered on the jury list as qualified to serve as spe-
</p>
<p>cial jurors, and have, notwithstanding, been omitted
</p>
<p>from the special pannel used on this occasion. It
</p>
<p>so happens, and very unfortunately, I think, that
</p>
<p>all those mistakes have been committed at one side ;
</p>
<p>and in the present state of the country I would ask,
</p>
<p>was such a circumstance to be treated lightly?
</p>
<p>These persons so omitted, strangely enough, hap-
</p>
<p>pen to be nearly all of the Roman Catholic per-
</p>
<p>suasion, and those who are not are considered not
</p>
<p>hostile to them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne  This question has already been pro-
</p>
<p>pounded and decided, and I have no more power
</p>
<p>over this pannel than you. I cannot entertain the
</p>
<p>subject, and I cannot see any use in stating facts
</p>
<p>here over which I have no control whatever.
</p>
<p>Mr. Kemmis could not entertain the subject, and
</p>
<p>that there was nothing for them to do but to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to reduce the list.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mahony  I have a document by me which I
</p>
<p>think of importance now. It is the Evening Packet
</p>
<p>of the 31st January, 1837, which contains a fact not

<p>undeserving of consideration after looking over the
</p>
<p>list of jurors struck yesterday. In this paper there
</p>
<p>is an article, stating that a " great Protestant meet-
</p>
<p>ing was held on the previous daj'," and there stand
</p>
<p>the names of some of the jurors as persons taking
</p>
<p>part in the proceedings. They are the two Mr.
</p>
<p>Boileaus, George Whitaker, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne  I really must again observe that I
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with this.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mahony  I offer this in addition to my for-
</p>
<p>mer grounds, before aslcing the solicitor for the
</p>
<p>crown will he consent to allow the jury list to be
</p>
<p>amended.
</p>
<p>Mr. Kemmis  I cannot consent to anything, but
</p>
<p>my immediate duty, which is to reduce the list.
</p>
<p>The following gentlemen were struck off by the
</p>
<p>crown, Mr. CantweU exclaiming, as each was re-
</p>
<p>moved, " There goes another Catholic."
</p>
<p>Struck by the Crown :  Timothy Greene, Michael
</p>
<p>Dunn, Cook-street ; James Fallon, John Behan, J.
</p>
<p>P. Smith, John Dennan, W. J. Cainen, Laurence
</p>
<p>Gorman, William Fitzpatrick, John M'Gloin, AVil-
</p>
<p>liam Heudrick, and William Ring.
</p>
<p>Struck by the Traversers :  John Carolin, John
</p>
<p>White, Robinson Carolin, John Thwaites, John Ir-
</p>
<p>win, George Whitaker, Robert Chamley, John T.
</p>
<p>Boileau, N. W. Montserratt, George W. Boileau,
</p>
<p>James Cuffe St. George, and John Foy.
</p>
<p>This reduced the list to twenty-four names. Mr.
</p>
<p>Bourne then read the following as the jury list : 
</p>
<p>1 Jas. Hamilton, 14, Upper Ormond-quay, wine-
</p>
<p>merchant.
</p>
<p>2 James 0. Papworth, 106, Marlborough-street, ar-
</p>
<p>chitect.

<p>other, the resolution seemed adopted that it was
</p>
<p>time the Catholics made sucli a demonstration as
</p>
<p>should convince the government of the impolicy of
</p>
<p>again uniting them in opposition to their rulers, and
</p>
<p>prove that they could not be insulted with im-
</p>
<p>punity.
</p>
<p>. Tliis much we felt it necessary to give in this
</p>
<p>place, in reference to a proceeding which arose out
</p>
<p>of the proceedings in the case of the government
</p>
<p>against the repeal leaders. But we shall not pursue
</p>
<p>this collateral portion of the subject further, but re-
</p>
<p>turn to the proceedings consequent upon the open-
</p>
<p>ing of the trial.
</p>
<p>o'connell's progress to the coorts.
</p>
<p>But before we enter the court, we shall give, as a
</p>
<p>matter of fact not inappropriately referred to in this
</p>
<p>place, the procession of the powerful traverser, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, from his residence in Merrion-square to
</p>
<p>the Four Courts.
</p>
<p>Many gentlemen, personal as well as political
</p>
<p>friends of Mr. O'Connell, e.\pressed their anxiety to
</p>
<p>accompany him to the courts on the morning of the
</p>
<p>15th of January. He felt it necessary, therefore,
</p>
<p>though not without some hesitation, to comply with
</p>
<p>their solicitations. It was arranged that the car-
</p>
<p>riages of such as should be desirous to pay this re-
</p>
<p>spect to the first " conspirator" and first of Irish-
</p>
<p>men, should be drawn up in Merrion-square at an
</p>
<p>early hour, and that a procession should be formed,
</p>
<p>which should accompany Mr. O'Connell to the pre-
</p>
<p>cincts of the Queen's Bench. Long before the liour
</p>
<p>at which the honourable and learned gentleman left
</p>
<p>his house, liis levee had increased to such a magni-
</p>
<p>tude, as that the gentlemen filled his house, and the
</p>
<p>carriages occupied more than oue side of the square

<p>before it.
</p>
<p>At half-past eight o'clock vehicles began to set
</p>
<p>down, and from that hour to a few minutes of ten,
</p>
<p>the arrivals were continuous. The company were
</p>
<p>received in the drawing-rooms, and when the " con-
</p>
<p>spirator," after having attended liis morning devo-
</p>
<p>tions, at length made his appearance, he was greeted
</p>
<p>most enthusiastically. The honourable gentleman
</p>
<p>appeared in buoyant health and spirits, and con-
</p>
<p>versed for a few minutes with his friends in his
</p>
<p>usual str^n of good humour.
</p>
<p>The procession at length started, and consisted of
</p>
<p>upwards of forty private carriages containing the
</p>
<p>traversers, the members of the corporation in their
</p>
<p>robes, and several of our most respectable fellow,
</p>
<p>citizens, who took this opportunity of testifying
</p>
<p>their respect for the father of his country, and their
</p>
<p>sympathy with the cause in which he was engaged.
</p>
<p>The city marshal, Mr. Reynolds, headed the cortege,
</p>
<p>mounted on a spirited charger. Next came the
</p>
<p>state cai'riage of the Kight Hon. the Lord Mayor,
</p>
<p>containing his lordship, the Liberator, and Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell, M.P. One of his lordship's private
</p>
<p>carriages followed with his son and secretary, Pa-
</p>
<p>trick O'Brien, Esq. harrister-at-law ; and amongst
</p>
<p>the occupants of the carriages which followed were
</p>
<p>the seven other traversers, and the majority of
</p>
<p>the aldermen and town councillors, most of them
</p>
<p>wearing their robes. Among Mr. O'Connell's private
</p>
<p>friends were L. Dillon, Parliament-street ; James

<p>Mr. Cantwell  My lords, I was attorney for the

<p>Bev. Peter James Tyrrell, and I have to state to you
</p>
<p>that the reverend defendant has been summoned be-
</p>
<p>fore the Judge of judges. His soul and body are
</p>
<p>alike beyond the power of this court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford^  I propose, my lords, that the witnesses'
</p>
<p>chair should be changed from its present position in
</p>
<p>the centre of the table to the end of it, as it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary for the counsel engaged in the cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion of witnesses to see their faces and hear their re-
</p>
<p>plies, which they cannot well do in the present posi-
</p>
<p>tion of the. chair. I move, therefore, my lords, that
</p>
<p>the chair be changed.f
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  It appears to be a fixture.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford  No, my lord, it is moveable.

</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Then you need not make a motion
</p>
<p>about it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Eaton (one of the gentlemen summoned on the
</p>
<p>jury) said  I have, my lords, to object to serve on
</p>
<p>the jury, in consequence of want of bodily strength,
</p>
<p>and because I feel myself incompetent to do my duty.
</p>
<p>I have the certificate of the medical gentleman
</p>
<p>who attended me. I fell off a scaffold in the front of
</p>
<p>a house in May last, and was confined to my bed for
</p>
<p>several weeks. I had a great struggle, indeed, be-
</p>
<p>tween life and death, and I beg you will excuse me
</p>
<p>from serving on the jurj'. The certificate I hold in
</p>
<p>my hand is quite sufiicient to show that I have not
</p>
<p>bodily strength to do my duty. If it were a trial
</p>
<p>that would ordy last for two, three, or four days, I
</p>
<p>would not object to be in it ; but I have not strength
</p>
<p>to act upon this juiy, the more especially as I under-
</p>
<p>stand the jury will not be allowed to go to their
</p>
<p>homes. I therefore submit that this certificate from
</p>
<p>my medical attendant be read.
</p>
<p>* There was some reason to conclude that the same
</p>
<p>course taken by the friends of the Irish government in the
</p>
<p>press would be followed by the government officers in
</p>
<p>court on the opening of the trial, and that evidence, in
</p>
<p>legal form, of the fact of the death of the Rev. Peter
</p>
<p>James Tyrrell, would be demanded. There was, there-
</p>
<p>fore, great sensation felt in court upon the mention of his
</p>
<p>name. The traversers' counsel had considered the sulj-
</p>
<p>ject, and had determined if such evidence was required of
</p>
<p>them, that they would talte no steps whatever in the mat-
</p>
<p>ter, but would leave the crown to its elected course. Even
</p>
<p>to the estreating of the recognizances of the departed, it
</p>
<p>was determined that no opposition should be offered or ex-
</p>
<p>' planation tendered. But the crown, fortunately for its

<p>Mr. PapworthMy name is Collins Papworth.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General James Collins Papworth and
</p>
<p>James Hamilton stand here and say their names are
</p>
<p>Collins Papworth and Joseph Hamilton. I don't
</p>
<p>know whether any mistake has occurred in the

<p>names, but I wish that James Collins Papworth and

<p>were summoned and did not attend.

<p>Dr. Stack  I am a physician and surgeon, and I
</p>
<p>have been in attendance on Mr. Holmes for the last.
</p>
<p>five days. He is in fever.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes was excused.

<p>An affidavit was handed in to the effect, that

<p>Kobert Smyth Stubbs was afflicted with asthma.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown  Wliat rule does your lord-
</p>
<p>ships make in the case of Mr. Stubbs ?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  He must be excused.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown addressed the traversers
</p>
<p>(all of whom had now answered to their names), and
</p>
<p>said the jury were now about to be sworn to try the
</p>
<p>issue.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mooi-e, Q.C I understand that some of the
</p>
<p>jurors summoned have not attended, and no excuse
</p>
<p>has yet been made for their non-attendance. The
</p>
<p>Attorney-General has called on your lordships to
</p>
<p>inflict fines on them; and I think it would be desi-
</p>
<p>rable that the service of the summonses on those gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen should be proved in the first instance, before
</p>
<p>a fine is inflicted, or anything further said.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General  I have no objection. I
</p>
<p>take it for granted that the sheriff has caused pro-
</p>
<p>per service to be effected ; and if the officer is in
</p>
<p>court it can be proved.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then called Daniel Ire-

<p>laud, who answered, and came on the table.

<p>as aforesaid, were at the time of the return of the

<p>said collectors' lists, and at the time of the said

<p>within the county of the said city of Dublin, and

<p>upon the said general list ; and the said Daniel

<p>O'Connell farther says, that from the said fraudu-

<p>lent paper-writing, purporting to be such general
</p>
<p>list as aforesaid, and a certain book, purporting to
</p>
<p>be the jurors' book of the said county of the city of
</p>
<p>Dublin for the current calendar year, to wit for the
</p>
<p>year 1844, was made up and framed, and that from
</p>
<p>the said book so purporting to be the jurors' book
</p>
<p>of the said county of the city for the said current
</p>
<p>year was made up the special jurors' list for the said
</p>
<p>current year, to wit the year 1844, and that the said
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell saith that the said several persons,
</p>
<p>whose names were so omitted from the said fraudu-
</p>
<p>lent paper-writing purporting to be such general
</p>
<p>list, were also omitted from the said book, pur-
</p>
<p>porting to be the said jurors' book, and from said
</p>
<p>list, purporting to be the said special jurors' list ;
</p>
<p>and the said Daniel O'Connell further saith that the
</p>
<p>said several persons so omitted as aforesaid had been
</p>
<p>duly adjudged and allowed by the said Recorder
</p>
<p>at the said special sessions to be persons having the
</p>
<p>qualification and qualifying, and entitling them, and
</p>
<p>each of them respectively, to be upon the jurors'
</p>
<p>book, and also to be upon the special jurors' list for
</p>
<p>the current year, to wit, the year 1844 ; and the
</p>
<p>said Daniel O'Connell further saith that the pannel

<p>aforesaid made and returned to try the issue in this

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>hete convenient to call your lordships' attention to
</p>
<p>the statnte. My lords, the 24th section of the jury
</p>
<p>act, the 3d and 4th Wm. IV., cap. 91, provides that
</p>
<p>the sheriff of every city shall, witliin ten days from
</p>
<p>the delivery of the jury lists, take from them the
</p>
<p>names of all such persons, as sons of peers and so-
</p>
<p>forth, who are qualified as special jurors, and cause
</p>
<p>the same to he fairly copied in alphabetical order in
</p>
<p>a separate list to be attached to the jurors' book,
</p>
<p>which said list shall be and constitute the special
</p>
<p>jurors' book, and the 23th section provides for the
</p>
<p>mode in which a special jury shall be struck from
</p>
<p>that list. Now, my lord, in the first place, looking
</p>
<p>to those challenges it must be taken, for the contrary
</p>
<p>is not averred, that the special jui-y struck in this
</p>
<p>case was taken from the special jury list and pro-
</p>
<p>perly made out by the slierifffrom the document
</p>
<p>given him, purporting to be the special jury book for
</p>
<p>1844, and as far as the high sheriffis concerned, there
</p>
<p>is nothing to show that he has not regularly and
</p>
<p>correctly performed his duties. So far everything
</p>
<p>has been done by him in compliance with the law in
</p>
<p>that particular. We then go back to the 9th sec-
</p>
<p>tion for the purpose of looking to the manner in
</p>
<p>which the jury book ought to he made out, from
</p>
<p>which the sheriff is to take the special jury list
</p>
<p>The effect of the challenge, or the designed effect
</p>
<p>was, to endeavour to establish by the averments
</p>
<p>which it contained, this doctrine, that the jury book
</p>
<p>for 1844 was absolutely null and void. The earlier
</p>
<p>portion of the act having explicitly provided for the
</p>
<p>mode and manner in which the collectors' Usts were
</p>
<p>to be corrected by the justices, or, in their absence,
</p>
<p>by the Recorder, the 9th section went on to provide

<p>that, when such lists had been corrected, allowed,
</p>
<p>and signed by the justices, a general list was to be
</p>
<p>made therefrom, containing the names of all persons,
</p>
<p>whose qualifications had been adj udicated upon, ar-
</p>
<p>rayed in order, according to their respective rank
</p>
<p>and property ; and the clerk of the peace was bound
</p>
<p>to make out from that general list a jury-book at
</p>
<p>the expense of the county, which he was to hand
</p>
<p>over to the high sheriff; and furthermore such jury-
</p>
<p>book was to come into use upon the 1st day of
</p>
<p>January, and fi-om it were to be taken all special
</p>
<p>juries that might be required for the purposes of the
</p>
<p>administration of justice during the period of one
</p>
<p>year next ensuing. From a perusal of the act it
</p>
<p>was easy to understand 'hat were the duties of the
</p>
<p>Eecorder, clerk of the peace, and high sheriff re-
</p>
<p>spectively, in connexion with the jury lists. The
</p>
<p>Eecorder having corrected the constables' or parish
</p>
<p>lists, was bound to cause to be made out therefrom a
</p>
<p>general list, containing the names of all jjersons
</p>
<p>whose qualifications had been allowed, arrayed ac-
</p>
<p>cording to rank and property ; and this general list
</p>
<p>he wis then bound to hand over to the clerk of the
</p>
<p>peace. This was the duty of the Eecorder, and
</p>
<p>here his duty ended. He gave the general list he
</p>
<p>had caused to be made out from the parish lists to
</p>
<p>the clerk of the peace, whose duty it was to make
</p>
<p>out from it a jury-book ; and then this said jury-
</p>
<p>book, when duly and properly made out, according
</p>
<p>to the pro^visions of the act, he was obliged to hand
</p>
<p>over to the high sheriff. When he read the aver-
</p>
<p>ments of this challenge, which had been most stu-
</p>
<p>diously framed, he would call the attention of the
</p>
<p>court to the character and nature of the allegations

<p>cidentally or otlienvise of a solitary name, or if a
</p>
<p>peer's sou liad been transposed accidentally for a
</p>
<p>baronet. Tliey complained that it -was not a list of
</p>
<p>all persons wlio had been admitted, and tliat tliey
</p>
<p>had not been arranged with a jealous regard to the
</p>
<p>order of precedence, according to rank and proper-
</p>
<p>ty; and tills was tlie kind of ingenious special
</p>
<p>pleading on which thej' relied, when they called upon
</p>
<p>their lordships to infer that no general list of quali-
</p>
<p>fied persons had been made out. And it did not
</p>
<p>even negative that a list purporting to be a general
</p>
<p>one, was not delivered to the clerk of the peace, or
</p>
<p>caused to he made out by the Recorder. So much
</p>
<p>they would see by that portion of the challenge.
</p>
<p>Then, it being consistent with that portion of the
</p>
<p>challenge, and it being the duty of the ofBcer of the
</p>
<p>Eecorder to make out a general list, and for the Ke-
</p>
<p>corder to give a general list to the cleric of the peace,
</p>
<p>the court was not to presume anytliiug but what
</p>
<p>was directly oifered, that was, the non-delivery by
</p>
<p>the Recorder to the clerk of the peace of a general
</p>
<p>list, containing every single name on the parish list,
</p>
<p>and not only every name, but those according to
</p>
<p>rank and property. The challenge set forth that
</p>
<p>such, contrary to law, was omitted to be done, and
</p>
<p>the said Daniel O'Connell further saith, that a cer-
</p>
<p>tain paper-writing, purporting to be a general list,
</p>
<p>purporting to be made out by such several parish
</p>
<p>lists, was illegally and fradulently made out by some
</p>
<p>persons unknown, and he saith that said paper- writ-
</p>
<p>ing did not contain all the persons whose qualifica-
</p>
<p>tions had been allowed in the correcting, allowing,
</p>
<p>and signing of said list, but omitted the names of
</p>
<p>divers persons to the number of fifty-nine, who are

<p>there respectively mentioned, and then it went on
</p>
<p>to state that from the same fraudulent paper- writing
</p>
<p>purporting to be such general list, a certain book
</p>
<p>purporting to be the jurors' book for the county of
</p>
<p>the city of Dublin for the current year was made up
</p>
<p>and framed. It did not, however, state what became
</p>
<p>of that book  it did not negative that it was deli-
</p>
<p>vered by the clerk of the peace to the high sheriff,
</p>
<p>and, such not being negatived, the court must pre-
</p>
<p>sume that it had been duly delivered, and the special
</p>
<p>jurors' list was made up from that book. As he had
</p>
<p>already stated, there was no pretence now, that what
</p>
<p>purported to be a juror's book for 1844, which was
</p>
<p>now amongst the records of tliat court, and of all
</p>
<p>the courts, not simply in the case of the Queen
</p>
<p>against O'Connell and others, but in every case to
</p>
<p>be tried in every court, had been handed to the high
</p>
<p>sheriff by the officer properly authorised by law to
</p>
<p>hand it, namely, the clerk of the peace ; and it hav-
</p>
<p>ing been so handed, the special list had been regu-
</p>
<p>larly made out from that jurors' book, and the court
</p>
<p>were then called upon to interfere, without the
</p>
<p>sUghtest shadow of imputation or allegation against
</p>
<p>the clerks of the peace, the officers authorized, and
</p>
<p>upon whom the duty was imposed by law, of hand-
</p>
<p>ing the jurors' book to the liigh sheriff, without the
</p>
<p>slightest imputation that the high sheriff had not
</p>
<p>done his duty, without the slightest allegation that
</p>
<p>a general list was not handed by the Recorder to the
</p>
<p>clerk of the peace. Under those circumstances the
</p>
<p>court, forsooth, were to nullify that record  that
</p>
<p>they were to declare the proceedings nuU and void
</p>
<p>in toto, because some unknown person, whom nobody

<p>could suggest the name of, may have, or did, as the

<p>made out an erroneous copy of the parish lists which
</p>
<p>B-as handed to the public officer, in reference to
</p>
<p>ulterior proceedings of inquiry into the jury lists,
</p>
<p>and got a special jury summoned for this issue, in
</p>
<p>order to found a challenge to the entire pannel, by
</p>
<p>attributing indiflerency to the sheriff. Tlie jury
</p>
<p>were drawn according to the law of the land, and,
</p>
<p>under the circumstances, your lordships are not
</p>
<p>called on to decide they are an improper jury, drawn
</p>
<p>from a special pannel improperly framed, because it
</p>
<p>is alleged there has been some fraud committed, no
</p>
<p>one knows by whom. It would destroy all pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings in a court of justice if it was in the power
</p>
<p>of any party to nuUify the proceedings by an irregu-
</p>
<p>larity of this kind. This might be a fair course if
</p>
<p>we were proceeding to consider who has caused this
</p>
<p>irregularity, and were taking means to bring him
</p>
<p>to justice, and it would be desirable to have him
</p>
<p>brought to justice, and I am sure the crown is just
</p>
<p>as much interested as any. Under all the circum-
</p>
<p>stances, I trust, I may observe it is exactly the case
</p>
<p>of the King v. Edmonds, 4 Barnwell and Alderson
</p>
<p>in England. The court decided in that case that
</p>
<p>challenge for indifferency of the master of the crown
</p>
<p>office should not lie to the array. I trust the court
</p>
<p>will allow the demurrer to this challenge, and hold
</p>
<p>that the trial must proceed.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen  My lords, I appear on
</p>
<p>behalf of the traversers, and I have to express my
</p>
<p>regret at the delay which has occurred. I assure
</p>
<p>your lordships it was entirely involuntary on our
</p>
<p>parts, and by way of atonement I shall occupy very
</p>
<p>few moments. My lords, I shall just remark in re-
</p>
<p>ply to an observation made by the learned Attorney-

</p>
<p>General respecting our riglit to challenge the array,
</p>
<p>I did not understand the learned Attorney- General
</p>
<p>as having raised the point. If he intends to rely on
</p>
<p>it I have a great number of authorities on the point.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  I do.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen  I refer, then, to some of
</p>
<p>the authorities. The learned counsel then called the
</p>
<p>attention of the court to Dickinson, Quarter Sessions
</p>
<p>by Talford, 401 ; Hayes, 443 ; Bacon's Abridge-
</p>
<p>ment ; Tit. Juries D. lu addition to these several
</p>
<p>text books I beg to refer your lordships to the Iving
</p>
<p>V. Burridge, 3 ; Wilson's Reports, 439 ; King v.
</p>
<p>Johnson, 2 ; Strange, 1,000 ; King t>. Nolan, 1 ;
</p>
<p>Hudson and Brooke, 164. This case was argued at
</p>
<p>the bar by my Lord Chief Justice and Justice
</p>
<p>Perrin, and in hearing that case. Baron Pennefather
</p>
<p>stated the King v. Edmonds could not be contro-
</p>
<p>verted ; but that the challenge, because of indif-
</p>
<p>ferency of the master of the crown office, and the
</p>
<p>sheriff, were not on the same grounds. Does he not
</p>
<p>receive the grand pannel, and has he not the names
</p>
<p>of the jury? Having referred the court to these
</p>
<p>cases, I come next to the form and effect of the pre-
</p>
<p>sent challenge. The learned Attorney-General sta-
</p>
<p>ted several points relating to the form. I call atten-
</p>
<p>tion, first, to the form of the challenge. He contends
</p>
<p>we omitted to state there was no general Bst made
</p>
<p>out by the clerk of the peace  this fact is most dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly stated. The challenge states that after the
</p>
<p>lists were signed by the Recorder the said Recorder
</p>
<p>did not, as by the statute required, make out a general
</p>
<p>list containing all names (and the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>laid stress on all ranged according to their rank),
</p>
<p>nor did the Recorder give such list to the clerk of the
</p>
<p>CHALLENGE OF THE AKKAY.
</p>
<p>105
</p>
<p>these were biiud cases, and should not be taken as
</p>
<p>precedences in the present argument.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Why do you call them blind cases
</p>
<p> ^was there no conviction ?
</p>
<p>Sir C. O'Loghlen  They should be considered so
</p>
<p>because in neither of them was there any allegation
</p>
<p>of fraud; and here it is alleged as a principal cause
</p>
<p>for the challenge. If the court should decide that
</p>
<p>the challenge did not lie in the present case, what
</p>
<p>remedy had the traversers, although the error com-
</p>
<p>plained of was admitted by the Attorney -General?
</p>
<p>The attorney has said, that if the challenge be ad-
</p>
<p>mitted, a formidable and inconvenient precedent will
</p>
<p>be established in the administration of justice. Tliis
</p>
<p>is not a fair conclusion ; the utmost that can ensue
</p>
<p>in the present case is a little delay; and if the court
</p>
<p>decides against the traversers they decide this prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, that if the conduct of the sheriff happens to be
</p>
<p>imimpeachable  no matter liow culpable or fraudu-
</p>
<p>lent the conduct of other officials in arranging the
</p>
<p>pannel may be  the pannel will not be vitiated. It
</p>
<p>is suggested that an action may be taken against
</p>
<p>them. What benefit would that be to the traversers ?
</p>
<p>It is said that there is no precedent for such a chal-
</p>
<p>lenge being allowed. Why such a case never oc-
</p>
<p>curred before, and the novelty of the application
</p>
<p>should be no reason for its refusal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton How is the fraud alleged ?
</p>
<p>SirColman O'Loghlen  Mr. O'Connell in his chal-
</p>
<p>lenge alleges that a paper containing the names of
</p>
<p>several persons qualified to act as special jurors was
</p>
<p>illegally suppressed from the list by some person or
</p>
<p>persons, and concludes by asserting " to the mani-
</p>
<p>fest injury of him the said Daniel O'Connell, on the

<p>present trial." The other challengers allege the
</p>
<p>suppression of the names " illegally and fraudu-
</p>
<p>lently," and for the purpose of injuring
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Have they alleged that it was done
</p>
<p>fraudulently, and for the purpose of injuring the
</p>
<p>traversers at the present trial ?
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen  It is alleged that " the
</p>
<p>said paper list was illegally made out for the purpose
</p>
<p>of injuring the said John Gray in this cause." The
</p>
<p>fact comes to this, that no list had been made, in
</p>
<p>pursuance of the prorisions of the act of parliament.
</p>
<p>It has not been so made out by the Kecorder  a
</p>
<p>fraudulent list has been made out by some persons
</p>
<p>unknown, aud the traversers were quite willing to
</p>
<p>enable the court to discover who those persons were ;
</p>
<p>but the Attorney-General refused to go to issue upon
</p>
<p>that past, and adopted a demurrer. The solicitors
</p>
<p>for the traversers had given fuU notice of iiis objec-
</p>
<p>tions to Mr. Bourne, the clerk of the crown. Mr.
</p>
<p>Kemmis also had notice ; yet, notwithstanding, they
</p>
<p>struck the jury list from that imperfect pannel.
</p>
<p>The question is, does fraudulent proceeding by any
</p>
<p>party vitiate the pannel ? Clearly ; it would be vi-
</p>
<p>tiated by the impropriety of the slieriiF, and why not
</p>
<p>then by the improper conduct of any other party ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  There appears to be a clerical
</p>
<p>mistake in one of the challenges the word objected
</p>
<p>is used for the word omitted.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen  We allege that the jury
</p>
<p>list has been packed. It is no answer to that to say
</p>
<p>the correction of it would delay the trial. How can
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General expect that the result of a trial
</p>
<p>under such circumstances could satisfy the country?

<p>It cannot be his private wish to proceed with the

<p>came to tlie names that he coulilnot read, that he
</p>
<p>skipped them over, and was in too great a hurry to
</p>
<p>go look for his glasses (laughter)  that he was not
</p>
<p>guilty of fraud, but of negligence; but could any
</p>
<p>negligence be more gross than that on the part of
</p>
<p>the Recorder, when he got back that list from his
</p>
<p>servant not to compare it with the list he had re-
</p>
<p>vised, and satisfy himself that he clearly, fairly,
</p>
<p>and honestly had done his duty? The traversers
</p>
<p>attended at the revision, which was a matter of pub-
</p>
<p>licity, and which was a matter to be done onl3' in
</p>
<p>open court, where they had liberty to attend, in
</p>
<p>pui-suance of the privilege which the law gave them.
</p>
<p>As soon as the list was placed under their eyes, and
</p>
<p>as soon as they had an opportimity of knowing whe-
</p>
<p>ther it was properly or improperly constructed, they
</p>
<p>forthwith proceeded to compare it with the notes
</p>
<p>they had previously taken, and the very moment thej'
</p>
<p>discovered that the list had been fraudulentlj' tam-
</p>
<p>pered with, or accidentally, at all events, wrongly
</p>
<p>framed, that very hour they, in limine, gave a distinct
</p>
<p>and express notice, as averred in the challenge, and
</p>
<p>not denied, to those acting for the crown, that the
</p>
<p>list was fraudulently and illegally constructed, and
</p>
<p>objecting to any further proceedings, and to having a
</p>
<p>jury taken fi'om that list until it had been completed.
</p>
<p>Let me suppose that a crown prosecutor or prosecu-

<p>tors are desirous for nothing more in the world than
</p>
<p>plain and simple justice, and abhorring notliiug
</p>
<p>more than an unjust conviction of any innocent

<p>should they not gladly embrace the opportunity
</p>
<p>given them of immediately correcting that fraudu-
</p>
<p>lent list ? It was not too late to do it. It was a
</p>
<p>thing very easy of accomplishment  it was only to
</p>
<p>discover who, or by whom, or by what accident if
</p>
<p>there was fraud committed, and that those names

<p>but to go back to the liecorder ? The materials
</p>
<p>were there to correct the list. He had the original
</p>
<p>lists, or ought to have them, and nothing could be
</p>
<p>easier than to add the names that were omitted.
</p>
<p>What could be fairer than that it should be required
</p>
<p>of the crown to add them ? The traversers were
</p>
<p>willing to consent that they should be added in any
</p>
<p>legal way, and why should not the crown be also
</p>
<p>wilhng that this fraud should be efTectually and
</p>
<p>properly corrected, and at all events that those
</p>
<p>traversers should not have cause to complain of
</p>
<p>this list? They had only then to adjourn till the
</p>
<p>next day, and inquire if those fifty-nine persons
</p>
<p>that were omitted were qualified persons, and if he
</p>
<p>adjudged them to be qualified persons they could
</p>
<p>put fifty-nine cards into the box and let the jury
</p>
<p>again be drawn. That was substantially proposed
</p>
<p>by the traversers, but not agreed to by the crown,
</p>
<p>and this decimated list was acted upon and the jury
</p>
<p>taken from it, thus excluding the traversers from
</p>
<p>the chance of having one in the jury out of the fifty-
</p>
<p>nine who might be a most honest and efficient jury-
</p>
<p>man. Did the traversers stop there ? No, again
</p>
<p>they made a motion to that court, submitting to the
</p>
<p>discretionary and equitable jurisdiction of the court
</p>
<p>the whole case, and that with notice to the crown.
</p>
<p>They met the crown here again ; they called on this
</p>
<p>CHALLENGE Of THE ARRAY.

<p>107
</p>
<p>some unknown individual, or this employe of the Re-
</p>
<p>corder, whose name has not been even given to the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, takes away from the list every
</p>
<p>qualified name that should appear on it, and inserts
</p>
<p>in their place the commonest mendicants in the
</p>
<p>community, is it to be argued that the individual
</p>
<p>charged shall be compelled to take his trial before
</p>
<p>them, instead of the legal and qualified jurors whom
</p>
<p>he is entitled to have empaiinelled ? They had
</p>
<p>heard a great deal here about the evil of delaying
</p>
<p>justice. Let justice be delayed until this fraud was
</p>
<p>rectified. :Was it a desirable thing to delay justice?
</p>
<p>No; but it was most desirable to delay injustice.
</p>
<p>It would be most desirable to put off injustice imtil
</p>
<p>the day of that final judgment when no injustice
</p>
<p>can take place. The time for doing so was very
</p>
<p>short. The Attorney-General said that our allega-
</p>
<p>tion is, that this is a void list of jurors. That is
</p>
<p>not our allegation ; uor do we allege that the list of
</p>
<p>1844, beiug imperfect, the oficer should have gone
</p>
<p>back to the list of 1843. He did not agree in that
</p>
<p>argument at all. Their argument did not allege
</p>
<p>tlmt the list of 1844 was a mere nullity ; but what
</p>
<p>they said was, that it contained defects which it was
</p>
<p>in the power of the crown to correct ; and those de-
</p>
<p>fects existing, it was clearly the right of the subject
</p>
<p>to demand their correction, and of the crown to aid
</p>
<p>in obtaining it ; and they would thank the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General a gi"eat deal more for doing so than for
</p>
<p>his proffered assistance in prosecuting the indivi-
</p>
<p>dual, whoever he may be, that was yet in the cole-
</p>
<p>hole in these transactions. The allegation was, that
</p>
<p>the list professing to be a correct one was con-
</p>
<p>structed, which was a defective one, and that it was

</p>
<p>to defective by the design or fraud of some one.
</p>
<p>He (Mr. Fitzgibbon) did not know what was meant
</p>
<p>by saying that the crown did not admit this fraud.
</p>
<p>He thought it was another proposition of law that
</p>
<p>everything legally jjut in was admitted in fact, if
</p>
<p>demurred to, and if the challenge was not legally
</p>
<p>put in it should not have been received at all. If the
</p>
<p>objection was illegal it was their duty to meet it by
</p>
<p>a special demurrer. The Attorney-General said
</p>
<p>there was no averment in the challenge that the Re-
</p>
<p>corder did not hand a list to the clerk of the peace.
</p>
<p>To be sure there was not. Did he suppose they
</p>
<p>would be insane enough to aver that ; but they
</p>
<p>allege that what he did hand him was an illegal
</p>
<p>list. The list, if not framed by the Recorder, was
</p>
<p>framed by some one by whom it should not be
</p>
<p>framed. Then he had the Attorney-General in
</p>
<p>this plain dilemma, that either the Recorder
</p>
<p>caused this fraudulent list to be made out, or that
</p>
<p>it was not a list made out by him at all. If it was
</p>
<p>not a list made out by him, what right had the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General to take a jury from it ? The duty
</p>
<p>of the Recorder was to make out a perfect list, and
</p>
<p>they alleged that he did not do that duty, and plainly
</p>
<p>and distinctly they alleged that the crown had taken
</p>
<p>a jury from a list either made out imperfectly by the
</p>
<p>Recorder, or made out by some unknown person,
</p>
<p>and a fraudulent Ust, and that they did so, being
</p>
<p>duly apprised that it was not a list the Recorder
</p>
<p>ought to have signed, and that with notice given
</p>
<p>them to that effect they forced it upon the tra-
</p>
<p>versers. Let the court look to the 35th section of
</p>
<p>the act of parliament, and they would see whether
</p>
<p>to the end it did not provide the means of rectifying

</p>
<p>the crown. Before entering on the discussion of
</p>
<p>the various legal topics which had been stated by the
</p>
<p>gentlemen on the other side, he thought it right to
</p>
<p>make an allusion to one expression which had fallen
</p>
<p>from his young friend. Sir Colman O'Loghlen, in
</p>
<p>the commencement of his speech. He certainly
</p>
<p>deeply regretted to hear his young friend make use
</p>
<p>of one expression in the course of his argument which
</p>
<p>he (the Solicitor-General) willingly attributed to
</p>
<p>inadrerteuce on his part. He alluded to the phrase
</p>
<p>" a packed jury," and he was bound to give his
</p>
<p>young friend the benefit of the supposition that he
</p>
<p>used the word through inadvertence, for he did not
</p>
<p>like to suppose that he had deliberately intended to
</p>
<p>use an expression exceedingly reprehensible, and
</p>
<p>totally unjustified even by the case of his own client.
</p>
<p>He (the Solicitor-General) should not have adverted
</p>
<p>to this circumstance were it not that he feared an
</p>
<p>erroneous and utterly unfounded impression might
</p>
<p>go abroad upon the public mind, in consequence of
</p>
<p>an expression of the kind, thrown out, perhaps, by
</p>
<p>inadvertence, but in point of truth and justice
</p>
<p>wholly untenable. That such was the case in the
</p>
<p>present instance was induced by the course pursued
</p>
<p>by the learned gentleman who spoke after Sir Col-
</p>
<p>man O'Loghlen, and who at the conclusion of his
</p>
<p>argument admitted there was no ground for saying
</p>
<p>that any of the respectable men in court to-day
</p>
<p>would not fairly decide the issue between the crown
</p>
<p>and the traversers. He would now proceed to the
</p>
<p>discussion of the legal grounds on which it was con-
</p>
<p>tended that the challenge ought to be accepted, and
</p>
<p>deemed good by the court. The Attorney-General
</p>
<p>did insist, and so did he (the Solicitor-General),

<p>that in point of strict law this challenge did not lie.
</p>
<p>It was quite a different case from a case of partiality
</p>
<p>on the part of the high sheriff. But in the present
</p>
<p>case no such imputation was made against the re-
</p>
<p>spectable gentleman who filled the ofBce of high
</p>
<p>sheriff. He now turned to the argument of his
</p>
<p>learned friend, Mr. Fitzgibbon, and he thought that
</p>
<p>argument unjustifiable, as it implied a charge of
</p>
<p>fraud or negligence against a high judicial officer,
</p>
<p>who was not then before the court to defend himself.
</p>
<p>It was built on the assumption that the Recorder
</p>
<p>had been guilty of a gross violation of his public
</p>
<p>duty, and certainly all assumptions of that kind were
</p>
<p>most sincerely to be deprecated. There was a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman of high rank and character absent from court
</p>
<p>and not represented there by counsel to reply to
</p>
<p>the observations that were made upon his conduct 
</p>
<p>observations actually charging him with nearly
</p>
<p>criminal neglect. He could not but condemn such
</p>
<p>allusions, and he was sure very many persons echoed
</p>
<p>the same sentiment. He would pass from that topic
</p>
<p>for the present, and come to the legal points for dis-
</p>
<p>cussion. Sir Colman O'Loghlen argued that the
</p>
<p>word " all" is a material word in the act of parlia-
</p>
<p>ment and in the challenge. They would recollect
</p>
<p>that the point contended for by his learned friend,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General, against that challenge was,
</p>
<p>that certain averments were omitted which it was
</p>
<p>necessary for the party insisting after the challenge
</p>
<p>to make, and he (the Solicitor-General) also con-
</p>
<p>tended that the word "all" was rather an argument
</p>
<p>in favour of the crown, for it was because " all"
</p>
<p>was material that the issue would be decided against
</p>
<p>the party making it if one name was omitted. It was

</p>
<p>it cannot be altered, but must be the book for 1844.
</p>
<p>It is argued the 35th section gives penalty against she-
</p>
<p>riffs. He contended it did when they neglected their
</p>
<p>duty, but here the sheriff did exactly what he ought.
</p>
<p>If he put one of tlie fifty-nine names on he ivould be
</p>
<p>liable to the penalty of the law, or if he refused to
</p>
<p>take the book when the clerk of the peace offered it.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton It is averred the fraud was
</p>
<p>committed in omitting the names.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  .Admitted the challenge says
</p>
<p>that fraud was committed, but, in legal parlance.
</p>
<p>He contended, inasmuch as no one was charged with
</p>
<p>fraud, such could not be presumed. This further
</p>
<p>it alleges in charge, that the fraud was done to
</p>
<p>the prejudice of Daniel O'Connell and the other
</p>
<p>traversers ; but, in answer, he would say that this
</p>
<p>should not be replied to. If the traversers had
</p>
<p>alleged that some of the fifty-nine persons were
</p>
<p>friends of theirs, or that any one was put on the list
</p>
<p>unjustly, it would be a change in the circumstances
</p>
<p>of the case. He put this only as a conjecttire  the
</p>
<p>jury had to try the fact. There was an absence of
</p>
<p>proof, but there is a sweeping allegation altogether
</p>
<p>that it was done fraudulently by some persons un-
</p>
<p>known. Suppose it was done with an intention to
</p>
<p>serve the traversers  it may be done by persons
</p>
<p>wholly unconnected with them. He did not allege
</p>
<p>that it took place with their privity, or whether
</p>
<p>they knew it or not, or if it took place through the
</p>
<p>means of any person over which the court had con-
</p>
<p>trol ; but that was no reason why the book should
</p>
<p>be thrown overboard. He believed that no such
</p>
<p>challenge ever took place before. It was argued if the
</p>
<p>challenges were not admitted that the trial would not

</p>
<p>give satisfaction to the country. That the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General should give in to the challenges in order that
</p>
<p>the trials might give satisfaction to the country, was a
</p>
<p>topic which he did not intend to introduce at the
</p>
<p>present time. He would ask if the array was to be
</p>
<p>quashed, not because the jury was corrupt, but on
</p>
<p>account of the book being imperfect, having fifty-
</p>
<p>nine or sixty names omitted from it. He under-
</p>
<p>stood that perfectly well, but he did not admit of its
</p>
<p>relevancy. He was told it was from the jury book
</p>
<p>for 1844, from wliich were omitted fifty-nine names,
</p>
<p>that the jury was selected, and for tliat reason the
</p>
<p>trials should be suspended until next January ; or if
</p>
<p>the traversers be now tried that they must be tried by
</p>
<p>that condemded book. When Mr. Fitzgibbon speaks
</p>
<p>of the jury panel and the fraud committed, he
</p>
<p>laiinciied out upon the duties of the several officers,
</p>
<p>and exclaims is it not monstrous that the law should
</p>
<p>be thus tainted? He spoke of the defendants as
</p>
<p>not being privy. How could it be said that they were
</p>
<p>privy to the acts of a person unknown ? It seemed
</p>
<p>quite monstrous to induce the necessity of arguing
</p>
<p>upon such a topic. His learned friend said the jury
</p>
<p>book was an illegal one in point of fact ; he could
</p>
<p>well understand the effect an assertion of that kind
</p>
<p>would have in court. When he took demurrer to
</p>
<p>the challenge, he would say there was no illegality
</p>
<p>in the book. It was for the purpose of determining
</p>
<p>whether it was illegal or not that the demurrer was
</p>
<p>taken, and when that was done he was told that he
</p>
<p>admitted its illegality. His argument was founded
</p>
<p>upon the denial of its illegality. Counsel for the
</p>
<p>traversers sought to set aside the trial until a new
</p>
<p>list would be made out. He would deny that the
</p>
<p>110
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>order that lie may insert the names which have been
</p>
<p>improperly omitted, and that then a new special
</p>
<p>jury should be struck at once, and the trial pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded with.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  I object altogether to the
</p>
<p>proposal of my learned friend. I am astonished
</p>
<p>that he would make a proposal which he ought to
</p>
<p>know could not possibly be complied with ; there is
</p>
<p>no power under the statute by which it could be
</p>
<p>done ; the alteration would affect every proceeding
</p>
<p>taken during the whole year, and he must have
</p>
<p>known that it was illegal, and that if any person
</p>
<p>was tried under that new list it would be erroneous,
</p>
<p>and a party unbound by the consent could object to
</p>
<p>the proceedings. I should not be fit to hold my
</p>
<p>office for one hour if I were to permit this illegal
</p>
<p>course to be taken.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, Q.C The Attorney-General has very
</p>
<p>grossly misconceived the proposition which I made.
</p>
<p>I am surprised he would have thought that I should
</p>
<p>exhibit such monstrous ignorance as to make a pro-
</p>
<p>position, the effect of which would be such as he
</p>
<p>states. I disclaim all intention of the kind. I
</p>
<p>made a proposition in perfect good faith, in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of instructions I received from my clients.
</p>
<p>I will not reply to his observation in reference to
</p>
<p>myself; but in nialdng my proposition I did that
</p>
<p>which I conceive could be done without displaying
</p>
<p>that degree of impropriety or ignorance of my pro-
</p>
<p>position which he has thought proper to allude to.
</p>
<p>(loud applause.)
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  My lords, if again in the
</p>
<p>course of these proceedings any persons in this court
</p>
<p>shall conduct themselves in themanner we have just

</p>
<p>heard, I will beg leave to request that your lordships
</p>
<p>will order the gallery to be cleared. The learned
</p>
<p>counsel on the other side called upon me to do that
</p>
<p>which is illegal.
</p>
<p>[The cheer which called forth this observation
</p>
<p>came principally from the bar.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  Certainly not.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  What he did call upon
</p>
<p>me to do was this  to consent to the jurors' book
</p>
<p>being amended by the Recorder; and I say that
</p>
<p>cannot be legally done. I said it would affect the
</p>
<p>legality of every judicial proceeding of tlxis nature
</p>
<p>in 1844, and I reiterate that assertion.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice delivered judgment. He said
</p>
<p>the majority of the court in this case were of opinion
</p>
<p>that the demurrer must be allowed, and consequently
</p>
<p>that the challenge must be overruled. The subject
</p>
<p>matter was not new to the consideration of the court,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as the argument at both sides embraced
</p>
<p>substantially the greater part of what the court were
</p>
<p>occupied with pretty nearly the entire of last Fri-
</p>
<p>day.* The court then gave judgment, and upon every
</p>
<p>consideration that he had been able to give to it since
</p>
<p>he found no reason to find fault with the judgment
</p>
<p>of the court then through him pronounced ; on the
</p>
<p>contrary, all the consideration he had been able to
</p>
<p>give the- case ever since, or in the progress of the
</p>
<p>argument this day, had tended to confirm him in
</p>
<p>the opinion he then entertained. The application
</p>
<p>that was for the consideration of the court was that
</p>
<p>for certain reasons then brought forward the pannel
</p>
<p>should be quashed. In the present proceeding the
</p>
<p>same question precisely was not the question upon
</p>
<p>which they were now called up to give their judg-
</p>
<p>CHALLENGE OF THE ARRAY.

<p>Ill
</p>
<p>make certain returns to him, at a time pointed out,
</p>
<p>TThich lists were to he laid before the Recorder for
</p>
<p>the city of Dublin, for his revision and adjudication
</p>
<p>upon. The meaning of the Recorder's adjudication
</p>
<p>was this  the admission on the jury list of every
</p>
<p>man in the parish vrho, having a rightful claim to
</p>
<p>be a special juror, substantiated that claim before
</p>
<p>the Recorder, or else the rejection of all such per-
</p>
<p>sons as failed to make their claims good. Now, in
</p>
<p>order that these matters might be judicially investi-
</p>
<p>gated the lists as returned by the parish collectors
</p>
<p>were ordered to remain open to public inspection in
</p>
<p>the office of the clerk of the peace for at least the
</p>
<p>period of three weeks, and any one who desired dur-
</p>
<p>ing these three weeks to get information on the
</p>
<p>subject, or to make himself master of the lists, was
</p>
<p>entitled to do so. And fui'thennore, it was open to
</p>
<p>all persons to oppose, if they thought there was
</p>
<p>reason for so doing, the claims of parties applying
</p>
<p>to be admitted as jurors, and it was for the Recorder
</p>
<p>conclusively and finally to adjudicate upon each
</p>
<p>claim, whether for its admission or its rejection.
</p>
<p>The Recorder was armed with full power to enable
</p>
<p>him to conduct the investigation to a satisfactory
</p>
<p>conclusion; but he was not permitted to do so with-
</p>
<p>out giving the parties iuterested due notice as to
</p>
<p>whether their claims would be disputed or substan-
</p>
<p>tiated. After that pubhc investigation the Recor-
</p>
<p>der was to make his judicial decision, which was not
</p>
<p>controllable \>y any tribunal in the country unless
</p>
<p>there was a charge of fraud or corruption. The
</p>
<p>Court of Queen's Bench had a superintending power
</p>
<p>over all magistrates and officers if any attempt were
</p>
<p>made to avoid the law or to violate it, but it was

</p>
<p>only in such eases they had a right to interfere, and
</p>
<p>if no such violation of the law were imputed to the
</p>
<p>Recorder the court had no possible authority to in-
</p>
<p>terfere with his decision in the present instance.
</p>
<p>His conduct, as long as no accusation was brought
</p>
<p>against him, was beyond the investigation or con-
</p>
<p>trol of the Queen's Bench. The Recorder had been
</p>
<p>selected by the legislature as the first determiner of
</p>
<p>matters of this nature. It was a very high privilege
</p>
<p>with which he was invested, for, no doubt, his ju-
</p>
<p>risdiction in this respect was very much coimected
</p>
<p>with the flow of justice and the purity of the admi-
</p>
<p>nistration of the laws. But he was left without con-
</p>
<p>trol, and there must have been very good reasons,
</p>
<p>as we were to presume there had, for making his
</p>
<p>decision final and beyond appeal. In the particular
</p>
<p>case under the consideration of the court the pre-
</p>
<p>cepts were issued and returned, the lists were duly
</p>
<p>made out by the parish officers  the requisite inves-
</p>
<p>tigation took place  the Recorder made his revision,
</p>
<p>and having pronounced his decisions they were irre-
</p>
<p>versible, and could not be reviewed by any one.
</p>
<p>After that revision another duty was imposed upon
</p>
<p>the Recorder, and it was this, that he should cause
</p>
<p>to be made out a new list or lists, containing the
</p>
<p>names of all the persons on whose claim he had ad-
</p>
<p>judicated, arranged according to rank and property.
</p>
<p>But no penalty was imposed upon the Recorder for
</p>
<p>omitting to do tliis or any other duty devolving
</p>

</p>
<p>this challenge that the omission of names which it
</p>
<p>complained of having occurred on the part of the
</p>
<p>Recorder, was the consequence of wilful impropriety
</p>
<p>or corruption, nor in the argument of the case had

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>The list so made out according to right and property
</p>
<p>is handed to the clerk of the peace, who is the pro-
</p>
<p>per officer appointed by the statute, and the Re-
</p>
<p>corder's duty is then at an end. It goes into the
</p>
<p>hands of a subordinate officer, whose duty is chalked
</p>
<p>out by act of parliament, which he is bound to fol-
</p>
<p>low independent of the sheriff. The duty of the
</p>
<p>clerk of the peace to make out jurors' lists for the
</p>
<p>ensuing year is express, and he is provided with
</p>
<p>funds for that purpose, and then he is to give the
</p>
<p>jury lists into the hands of the sheriff. If malversa-
</p>
<p>tion or corruption be displayed on the part of the
</p>
<p>sheriff, who is the officer of this court (which the
</p>
<p>Recorder is not)  if he acts corruptly he is liable
</p>
<p>to be called to account, and such misconduct is
</p>
<p>properly the subject for a challenge to the array
</p>
<p>as arising out of unindifferency of such sheriff.
</p>
<p>\Vho is to try the unindifferency of the Recorder?
</p>
<p>He is here or represented by counsel ; his unin-
</p>
<p>differency is not allowed to be assigned as cause,
</p>
<p>besides being an independent judicial officer he
</p>
<p>stands in the position of the master of the crown
</p>
<p>officer in the case cited from Barnwell and Alderson.
</p>
<p>And if the conduct of the master of the crown officer
</p>
<p>formed no ground in that case a fortiorari, the Re-
</p>
<p>corder's cannot. He has decided on the matter and
</p>
<p>liis decision is final. It is a great inconvenience
</p>
<p>that delay should arise in this case, because the for-
</p>
<p>mation of the jury pannel is a matter which the
</p>
<p>country is interested in upholding. A proposition
</p>
<p>was made by Jlr. Moore. I am not called on to
</p>
<p>say whether the Attorney-General was right or
</p>
<p>wrong in not yielding to it, but I say there is not a
</p>
<p>man who may be a suitor during the year 1844 who

</p>
<p>is not interested in upholding the proceedings.
</p>
<p>What would be the consequence if this course was
</p>
<p>allowed  if one party could take objections by
</p>
<p>which his adversary might be rescued from delay ?
</p>
<p>Tills is a general list for the whole countiy, and
</p>
<p>perhaps some of these employed in preparing it
</p>
<p>would be suitors during the year 1844. Tlie law
</p>
<p>has provided the proceedings of the Recorder of
</p>
<p>DubUn should be final, and not subject to the revi-
</p>
<p>sion of any other tribunal. The result is having the
</p>
<p>jury list prepared, and the sheriff is to take his
</p>
<p>special jury list from the general list, returned by
</p>
<p>the clerk of the peace. He could not add one of
</p>
<p>these names said to have been omitted. It might
</p>
<p>not be explained  it might be that the subject was
</p>
<p>under a cloud ; but that is not the question. The
</p>
<p>question is whether these proceedings are to be set
</p>
<p>aside, in consequence of the mistake which has
</p>
<p>occurred. His lordship, after adverting to the de-
</p>
<p>lay which had occurred in the case, declared his
</p>
<p>judgment to be that the challenge should be over-
</p>
<p>ruled, and the demurrer allowed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton said that the question must be
</p>
<p>considered, not ^vith reference to any other cases,
</p>
<p>but upon the present case as it stood before them.
</p>
<p>Being of the same opinion with his learned bretliren
</p>
<p>on the subject, he would not occupy more of the
</p>
<p>public time than possible ; he could only say he had
</p>
<p>felt a great deal of anxiety on the subject, that every
</p>
<p>thing should be as free from imputation as possible,
</p>
<p>and that a court of justice where it is possible to
</p>
<p>act in such a way as to render the proceedings
</p>
<p>free fi-om imputation, it should be achieved if pos-
</p>
<p>sible, but in the present case it was the opinion of
</p>
<p>CHALLENGE OF THE ARRAY.
</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>on the general list. Thei'e is no fault, tlien, imputed
</p>
<p>to the officers. The fault of a stranger was no good
</p>
<p>cause for challenge. There was no imputation
</p>
<p>against the Recorder. Even Mr. Fitzgibbon had
</p>
<p>imputed to him nothing stronger than negligence.
</p>
<p>The curious challenge alleged that the Recorder
</p>
<p>properly admitted sixty persons who were not af-
</p>
<p>terwards found on the general list. The Recorder's
</p>
<p>duty is judicial, and that court had no control over
</p>
<p>it. There might be a remedy, but it was in another
</p>
<p>place. His duty was first to adjudicate on the list,
</p>
<p>and afterwards to arrange the list  that is, make
</p>
<p>out a statutable copy, placing the jurors according
</p>
<p>to rank and property, and not alphabetically, and
</p>
<p>afterwards to see this fairly copied. His act is
</p>
<p>final  no court could go behind it. Some individual
</p>
<p>may have perpetrated a fraud-  an individual may
</p>
<p>he injured by it, but the general principle of the
</p>
<p>law must prevail. They were then giving a deci-
</p>
<p>sion which would affect the whole community for a
</p>
<p>year to come, and individual grievances must be
</p>
<p>suffered for the public good. If the challenge were
</p>
<p>permitted, twelve months would elapse before a spe-
</p>
<p>cial jury list could be framed. If the omission of
</p>
<p>sixty names would render the list a nullity, so
</p>
<p>would the omission of one name. He concluded,
</p>
<p>after giving some further reasons, by expressing his
</p>
<p>concurrence with the judgment already pronounced.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin said he had carefully considered the
</p>
<p>act of parliament and its provisions since the motion
</p>
<p>which had been before the court on Friday, and ap-
</p>
<p>plying its provisions to the motion which appeared
</p>
<p>upon the challenge here put in, he was under the
</p>
<p>disadvantage of not coming to the conclusion to

</p>
<p>which the Lord Chief Justice and his brethren had
</p>
<p>come. He thought it a subject of considerable doubt
</p>
<p>that the challenge ought to be allowed. By the act
</p>
<p>of parliament the collectors were to make out, in
</p>
<p>alpliabetical order, two lists of all qualified persons
</p>
<p>in their districts, and to deliver them to the clerk of
</p>
<p>the peace, who shall keep them for public inspection
</p>
<p>a certain time, and at the special sessions fixed for
</p>
<p>the revision and correction of those by the insertion
</p>
<p>of the proper person, or the omission of an improper
</p>
<p>person, at those special sessions fixed for that pur-
</p>
<p>pose, when every such list shall be duly corrected by
</p>
<p>the justices in counties at large, and by the Recorder
</p>
<p>in the city of Dublin, and shall be allowed and signed
</p>
<p>by them, or three of them, he or they shall cause a
</p>
<p>general list. He (Judge Perrin) would pause here.
</p>
<p>He concurred entirely in the view taken by the Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice as to the judicial functions of the Re-
</p>
<p>corder, and he would say that there was a distinc-
</p>
<p>tion to be taken between liis judicial and his minis-
</p>
<p>terial duties, and that here the judicial duties of the
</p>
<p>Recorder terminated. He said that as far as that
</p>
<p>the proceeding of the Recorder was strictly judicial
</p>
<p> that he himself, and the justices themselves, in
</p>
<p>the case of justices, after the public court was closed,
</p>
<p>aud the lists allowed and signed, could not make
</p>
<p>any alteration in that list, he meant after the court
</p>
<p>had closed, and, therefore, he took it that the judi-
</p>
<p>cial duty of the Recorder then closed, and what re-
</p>
<p>mained for him then to do was not to write in his
</p>
<p>own hand, but to get a general list made containing
</p>
<p>the names of all those whose qualification had been
</p>
<p>60 allowed, otherwise it would be idle if the general
</p>
<p>list did not contain all the names, and which list was

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>if the Recorder were conscious of it. It appears to
</p>
<p>tne that this challenge maintains that this was not in
</p>
<p>truth a general list made from the other lists (made
</p>
<p>perfectly and fully from the other lists), wliich it
</p>
<p>ought to be, in order to constitute a foundation for
</p>
<p>the jury book. It has been observed that this act
</p>
<p>of parliament was framed with great care, and for a
</p>
<p>most important object  the securing of proper and
</p>
<p>competent jurors, and leaving as little in the power
</p>
<p>of particular officers as could be left to them. I
</p>
<p>think it had in view a much more important object
</p>
<p>than what may be called the mere finality of its
</p>
<p>terms. If we hold that an alteration or suppression
</p>
<p>of this sort made by those persons who must be em-
</p>
<p>ployed to do a particular duty, and, unknown to the
</p>
<p>officer, is incurable and not to vitiate the act pur-
</p>
<p>porting to be done by the judge or superior officer,
</p>
<p>I am at a loss to underst^d what security there is
</p>
<p>for the purity of the jurors' book. The correct one
</p>
<p>may be mutilated and another substituted, and I
</p>
<p>cannot imagine that it would be contended that be-
</p>
<p>cause it was handed in by the officer, that it should
</p>
<p>be regarded as a true copy, and the real foundation
</p>
<p>from which the jurors' book ought to be made out.
</p>
<p>It seems to me that if such a thing was practised,
</p>
<p>and that it came to the ears of the Justice or Re-
</p>
<p>corder that not only the first thing he would do,
</p>
<p>but the first thing he would be bound to do, would
</p>
<p>be to go to the sheriff with the real list and call upon
</p>
<p>Mm to repudiate the fabricated one, and correct his
</p>
<p>book according to the true one. There seems to be
</p>
<p>gome difficulty suggested as to whether he could do
</p>
<p>that. It strikes me that, in my humble judgment,
</p>
<p>that it is not only what he would do, but what it

</p>
<p>would be his bounden duty to do. Taking another
</p>
<p>view of the case  suppose the sheriff in framing his
</p>
<p>special jury list had marked off names from the ge-
</p>
<p>neral list for his clerk, and that he omitted many of
</p>
<p>those names, and that the special jury list was fram-
</p>
<p>ed with the omission of those names, and that the
</p>
<p>omission was not discovered until the forty-eight
</p>
<p>names were about to be drawn  it does strike me
</p>
<p>that would be a cause for challenging the array. On
</p>
<p>the same principle I may suppose a Nisi PHus trial
</p>
<p>in fbe country for which the sheriff returns a dis-
</p>
<p>tritgas to this court, and here it lies for some days.
</p>
<p>Suppose that an under-officer or clerk of the court
</p>
<p>was to alter the names on that distringas, and that
</p>
<p>when it went down to the country for the first time
</p>
<p>the alteration was discovered, surely that would be
</p>
<p>j, ground for challenging the array. It might be
</p>
<p>objected against the present challenge that it was
</p>
<p>novel, but its novelty arose from this, that the act of
</p>
<p>parliament was one of recent date. Before the pass-
</p>
<p>ing of that statute the high sheriff was uncontrol-
</p>
<p>lable in his duty. He might, if he chose, return
</p>
<p>whom he liked for his jury ; but the statutable pro-
</p>
<p>Vision confined his power of selection to a particular
</p>
<p>jury book, to be taken from a particular Ijst, and if
</p>
<p>the provisions of the law, in this respect were vio-
</p>
<p>lated, even though there was no fraud in question,
</p>
<p>it still came within the principle upon which the
</p>
<p>challenge of array rested, and was originally founded.
</p>
<p>Much had been said about the inconvenience which
</p>
<p>would result from admitting the present challenge,
</p>
<p>as thereby an embarrassing precedent would be
</p>
<p>established. But he did not think that they (the

<p>Mr. Henn  We would of course undertake that

<p>if any application had been originally made on this
</p>
<p>point, I was prepared to show by authority that tra-
</p>
<p>versers bound by recognizances had no right to ap-

<p>pear by attorney. I have a right to make them ap-

<p>pear in person, as it may prevent delay otherwise

<p>that they shall appear personally from day to day

<p>Mr. O'ConneU Tliat is liable to seven or eight

<p>i Mr. Henn, Q.C submitted that Mr. Parker could

<p>not be excused. His time for making the objection
</p>
<p>was at the revision of the list. The learned gentle-

<p>His allegation as to age was not for this court. His

<p>Mr. Vance  I did.

<p>Mr. M'Uonogii  Was he excited then?

<p>Mr. Vanco^Very much so (laughter).

<p>The Attorney-General What is laughed at here

<p>is, that he has had two apoplectic attacks ; and tliis

<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Oil, there are a great many

</p>
<p>Mr. Napier  My lords and gentlemen, this is an

<p>indictment for unlawful conspiracy and confederacy,
</p>
<p>and contains eleven counts : 
</p>
<p>The 1st count charges the traversers with milaw-
</p>
<p>fully intending to excite disafiection and ill-wiU
</p>
<p>among her Majesty's subjects, and to weaken their
</p>
<p>confidence in the administration of justice, and by
</p>
<p>means of such unlawful combination and confederacy
</p>
<p>to obtain changes in the constitution and govern-
</p>
<p>ment of the country, and sets forth several overt acts.
</p>
<p>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>119
</p>
<p>meets witli the assent of tlie court. GentlemeD,
</p>
<p>Arith respect to the law of conspiracy, I have to state
</p>
<p>to you that conspiracy is a crime, which consists
</p>
<p>either in the combination and agreement by persons
</p>
<p>to do some illegal act, or a combination aud agree-
</p>
<p>ment to effect a legal act by illegal means ; and a
</p>
<p>confederacy to effect either an illegal object, or even
</p>
<p>a perfectly legal object by unlawful means, is in con-
</p>
<p>templation of law criminal, and amounts to the of-
</p>
<p>fence of conspiracy. Your lordships will find it so
</p>
<p>laid down by Lord Denman, and Judges Parke and
</p>
<p>Patteson, in the case of the King r. Jones, 4th Barn-
</p>
<p>wall and Adolphus, pages 349 and 350. My lords,
</p>
<p>in the case of the King v. Forbes, in this country,
</p>
<p>the law was laid down in the same way by the late
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice, in giving the judgment of the
</p>
<p>court. The passage to which I refer, will be found
</p>
<p>in Mr. Green's Report, page 347, and further, that
</p>
<p>the merely confederating constitutes the crime,
</p>
<p>though the object be not effected. My lords, in a
</p>
<p>more recent case of the Queen v. Murphy, wliich
</p>
<p>your lordships will find reported in 8 Carrington
</p>
<p>and Payne's Reports, page 310, the law of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy is thus laid down by Mr. justice Coleridge, in
</p>
<p>summing up that case to the jury:. Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Coleridge stated  " Tou have been properly told,
</p>
<p>that this being a charge of conspiracy, if you are of
</p>
<p>opinion that the acts, though done, were done with-
</p>
<p>out common concert and design between these two
</p>
<p>parties, the present charge cannot be supported. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, I am bound to tell you, that although
</p>
<p>the common design is the root of the charge, it is
</p>
<p>not necessary to prove that these two parties came
</p>
<p>together, and actually agreed in terms to have this

</p>
<p>common design, and to pursue it by common means,
</p>
<p>and so to carry it into execution. This is not ne-,
</p>
<p>cessary, because in many cases of the most clearly
</p>
<p>established conspiracies, there are no means of prov-
</p>
<p>ing any such thing, and neither law nor common
</p>
<p>sense requires that it should be proved. If you find
</p>
<p>that these two persons pursued by their acts the
</p>
<p>same object, often by the same means, one perform-
</p>
<p>ing one part of an act, and the other another part of
</p>
<p>the same act, so as to complete it, with a view to
</p>
<p>the attainment of the object wliich they were pur-
</p>
<p>suing, you will be at liberty to draw the conclusion,
</p>
<p>that they have been engaged in a conspiracy to
</p>
<p>effect that object. The question you have to ask
</p>
<p>yourselves is, had they this common design, and did
</p>
<p>they pursue it by these common means, the design
</p>
<p>being unlawful ? I ought also to tell you, that by
</p>
<p>finding the defendants guilty you will not (as has
</p>
<p>been said) affect the right of petitioning. It is not
</p>
<p>wrongful to assemble in a public meeting to petition
</p>
<p>parliament against that which is alleged to be a
</p>
<p>public grievance. It is not necessary, that it should
</p>
<p>be proved that these defendants met to concoct this
</p>
<p>scheme, nor is it necessary that they should have
</p>
<p>originated it. If a conspiracy be already formed,
</p>
<p>and a person joins it afterwards, he is equally guilty.
</p>
<p>You are to say whether from the acts that have been
</p>
<p>proved, you are satisfied that these defendants have
</p>
<p>been acting in concert in this matter. If you are
</p>
<p>satisfied, that there was concert between them, I am
</p>
<p>bound to say, that being con^'inced of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, it is not necessary that you should find both
</p>
<p>doing each particular act, as, after the fact of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is once established in your minds, whatever

<p>ing divers seditious resolutions and writings of and
</p>
<p>concerning the commons' liouse of parliament and
</p>
<p>tlie government of this realm ; and that the defen-
</p>
<p>dant did then and there publish and read several
</p>
<p>matters, set out in the indictment, of a seditious
</p>
<p>and inflammatory character at the meeting which
</p>
<p>they had then procured to be assembled, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of disseminating their sedition, and inciting
</p>
<p>the parties whom they got to meet together to dis-
</p>
<p>conteiit.and disaffection towards the government
</p>
<p>and the commons' house of parliament. The de-
</p>
<p>fendant in that case was found guilty of the crime
</p>
<p>imputed to him ; and Mr. Justice Rooke, in charging
</p>
<p>the jury, stated amongst other matters, in pages
</p>
<p>1151 and 1153  " You are therefore to consider,
</p>
<p>supposing the iiiuendoos fairly stated, whether it
</p>
<p>was their intention merely to enlighten the minds
</p>
<p>of the people upon a speculative point, or to carry
</p>
<p>them a step further, and to excite a spirit of discon-
</p>
<p>tent, disaffection and sedition in their min Is. If
</p>
<p>you be of opinion, that the defendant uttered those
</p>
<p>speeches with that view, or that they had that ten-
</p>
<p>dency even though he may not have had that de-
</p>
<p>sign, yet if a man will in a public assembly utter
</p>
<p>words having: a seditious tendency, he must take
</p>
<p>the consequences, and he can no more justify him-
</p>
<p>self for what he has done, by saying he did not think
</p>
<p>it would hare had that consequence, than a man
</p>
<p>who fired a pistol among a crowd should be allowed
</p>
<p>to say, ' I did not think my pistol would have gone
</p>
<p>80 far ;' or that a man shall be allowed to say, ' I
</p>
<p>only tried the effect of powder, and did not think
</p>
<p>it would have killed the man.' " And his lordship,

<p>stated, " If the conduct of the defendant here had
</p>
<p>been merely a speculation of his own, it would have
</p>
<p>been a different thing ; but when those speculations
</p>
<p>are gone forth in a large assembly, it will be for you
</p>
<p>to judge whether you will give him credit for the
</p>
<p>innocence of his exertions, and whether he did not
</p>
<p>address them with a view to inflame their minds
</p>
<p>and their passions." Now, my lords, 1 think it ad-
</p>
<p>visable to call your lordships' attention particularly
</p>
<p>to a very important case, bearing upon the subject
</p>
<p>of unlawful assemblies. And I call the attention
</p>
<p>both of the jury and of your lordships to this case,
</p>
<p>because as the law is laid down here, I think it will
</p>
<p>be foond to displace what I anticipate will be a por-
</p>
<p>tion of the defence in the present case. It is the
</p>
<p>case of Redford v. Birley, and is reported in the 3rd
</p>
<p>volume of Mr. Starkie's Nisi Prius Cases ; the re-
</p>
<p>port commences at page 76. Your lordships are
</p>
<p>aware that that was an action of trespass, brought
</p>
<p>against some of the persons who were concerned in
</p>
<p>dispersing the Manchester meeting. Pleas of jus-
</p>
<p>tification were put in, in that case. It came on for
</p>
<p>trial before Mr. Justice Holroyd, and there having
</p>
<p>been a verdict for the defendants justifying them
</p>
<p>for having dispersed the meeting, and establishing
</p>
<p>the illegality of that assembly, a motion was made
</p>
<p>for a new trial. The case came before the Court of
</p>
<p>King's Bench in England, before Lord Tenterden,
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Bayley, Mr. Justice Holroyd, and the
</p>
<p>present Lord Wynford ; and the court unanimously
</p>
<p>refused the motion to set aside the verdict, establish-
</p>
<p>ing the law as laid down by Mr. Justice Holroyd
</p>
<p>at the trial ; and each of these judges, when the case
</p>
<p>came on for argument in Banco, gave his opinion
</p>
<p>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>121
</p>
<p>Justice Bayley stated, tliat persons being assembled,
</p>
<p>and a place erected from which they might be ad-
</p>
<p>dressed, one person was there having no particular
</p>
<p>connexion with the place, but who had come a consi-
</p>
<p>derable distance to communicate with those persons,
</p>
<p>" he might by the intimations which he there made,
</p>
<p>give to that physical force, so assembled, a direction
</p>
<p>which might operate cither in perfect innocence, or
</p>
<p>with a great degree of danger to the public peace.
</p>
<p>At that time, then, you are to judge what the lan-
</p>
<p>guage will be, which he will make use of at the place
</p>
<p>where there is that large collection of physical
</p>
<p>strength, which may receive a direction from him
</p>
<p>what is likely to be the direction which he may be
</p>
<p>disposed to give it." Are wc to be told, and is it
</p>
<p>consistent with what these learned judges lay down,
</p>
<p>that you may have hundreds of thousands of persons
</p>
<p>assembled, whose course of proceeding is to be regu-
</p>
<p>lated by the directions. which they may receive from
</p>
<p>one individual, who may tell them to separate peace-
</p>
<p>ably ; who may do so for the purpose of carrying
</p>
<p>out further the designs of the conspiracy, aware that
</p>
<p>the organization is not sufficiently prepared for him
</p>
<p>to withdraw completely the mask which ill conceals
</p>
<p>liis designs ? But I deny that the circumstance of
</p>
<p>the meetings being peaceable, or concluding peace-
</p>
<p>ably, when assembled under the control of one mind,
</p>
<p>which may give them a direction one way or the
</p>
<p>other, constitutes a defence for them^I say, such is
</p>
<p>not the law of the land; and I shall ever hold so,
</p>
<p>until I hear it authoritatively laid down from the
</p>
<p>bench to the contrary. In page 125, the present
</p>
<p>Lord Wyuford, in giving his judgment, says  " It
</p>
<p>appears to me impossible to say, that this drilling

</p>
<p>was innocent." Observe, it was a drilling without
</p>
<p>arms. " If it was not innocent, what is it ? We
</p>
<p>have the key to it in the evidence of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>that though notliingwas to be done at this meeting,
</p>
<p>yet, when their numbers were seen, others would
</p>
<p>join them, and they would be then enabled to over-
</p>
<p>turn the government." You will hear it laid down
</p>
<p>on the part of the defendants, that all these meetings
</p>
<p>were legal, and that the confederacy to hold these
</p>
<p>meetings throughout the country, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>organizing the population against the law, Avas legal
</p>
<p> because they ended peaceably, although their so
</p>
<p>ending was to depend on the will of one man. In
</p>
<p>the subsequent page, 126, his lordship proceeds 
</p>
<p>" It is not necessary, for the purpose of showing it
</p>
<p>was illegal, to decide whether immediate mischief
</p>
<p>was to be then begun. I believe many went there
</p>
<p>without that intention; but I have had so much
</p>
<p>experience ou subjects of this sort, that I have known
</p>
<p>this occur, that those who follow are more in a
</p>
<p>hurry for execution than those who plan. I think,
</p>
<p>therefore, that it is most probable that that which I
</p>
<p>have stated is correct ; at least as far as regards the
</p>
<p>intentions of the leaders. Nothing mischievous was
</p>
<p>to be done that day ; they were only to ascertain
</p>
<p>the numbers; to accustom them to meet in large
</p>
<p>parties ; to inspire mutual confidence ; to incite
</p>
<p>others, by the great numbers they presented, to join
</p>
<p>in the scheme of those who had embarked them-
</p>
<p>selves ; and at some future day, when the drilling
</p>
<p>should be more advanced, when they should have
</p>
<p>had a trifling addition made to their discipline by
</p>
<p>having arms put into their hands, then the mischief
</p>
<p>was to be finally entered upon." Thus, my lords,

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>tute, which passed iu the same session as the Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic Relief Bill, was in force, giving stronger
</p>
<p>powers to the executive than it now possesses ; and
</p>
<p>that proclamation was issued by the government, of
</p>
<p>which Lord Grey was the head. In the course of
</p>
<p>that same year a question was put in the house of
</p>
<p>commons to a minister of tlie crown, Lord Altliorp,
</p>
<p>relating to this question of the repeal of the union.
</p>
<p>And Lord Althorp, in that session of parliament,
</p>
<p>namely, in 1831, made the following statement:
</p>
<p>" The case with respect to the government is this,
</p>
<p>that the honourable member for Waterford has, it
</p>
<p>is well known, been exciting so much discontent in
</p>
<p>Ireland, has been keeping up what he calls agitation
</p>
<p>in that country, that although the conclusion of
</p>
<p>every speech, however violent or inflammatory, has
</p>
<p>been an advice to his auditors to be obedient to the
</p>
<p>laws, it must be evident to every unprejudiced man,
</p>
<p>who has read those speeches, or who has marked the
</p>
<p>course which the honourable member has been pur-
</p>
<p>suing, that his language and conduct have had but
</p>
<p>ohe tendency, namely, to incite to insurrection and
</p>
<p>rebellion throughout the country ; I repeat it, their
</p>
<p>direct tendency has been as I describe it. Wliat, I
</p>
<p>ask, has been the avowed object of the honourable
</p>
<p>member for Waterford's agitation ? To obtain a
</p>
<p>repeal of the union. I would beg to ask any man,
</p>
<p>who has considered what the repeal of the union
</p>
<p>must produce, whether it does not become the duty
</p>
<p>of government, to employ every means in their
</p>
<p>power to prevent the accomplishment of an object,
</p>
<p>which must directly lead to an entire separation of
</p>
<p>the two countries ? Sir, I' trust, that those wlio
</p>
<p>seek for a repeal of the union will not succeed.

</p>
<p>Iftlioy do succeed, it must be by successful war;
</p>
<p>and from the spirit of my countrymen, I hold that
</p>
<p>to be impossible. The honourable member has
</p>
<p>piade allusion to such aa extremity ; I tell him that
</p>
<p>no man entertains a greater horror of war than I
</p>
<p>do ; and of all descriptions of war, I think a civil
</p>
<p>war is most to be dreaded. But, sir, I also tell
</p>
<p>him, that even civil war itself would be preferable
</p>
<p>to the dismemberment and destruction of the em-
</p>
<p>pire. I have felt it my duty to state thus fairly and

<p>boldly what are the views of his Majesty's govern-
</p>
<p>ment on this momentous subject." Such was the
</p>
<p>position in which tlie repeal question stood in 1831 ;
</p>
<p>such was the opinion entertained by the then govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; and it is important, in considering the course
</p>
<p>pursued at the present day in seeking to obtain tlie
</p>
<p>repeal of the union, to show, that the only means by
</p>
<p>wliich it can be carried out, are means not consistent
</p>
<p>with the law or the constitution ; and before I close
</p>
<p>my statement, I will prove out of the mouths of the
</p>
<p>defendants themselves, that their intention was to
</p>
<p>obtain tlie repeal of the union otherwise than by le-
</p>
<p>gal and constitutional efibrts. Tlie observations of
</p>
<p>Lord Althorp show that speeches might be intended
</p>
<p>to incite, not to immediate outbreak, but to ulti-
</p>
<p>mate insurrection, by the disaffection produced on
</p>
<p>the minds of those to whom the speeches were ad-
</p>
<p>dressed, aided by the organization establislied
</p>
<p>throughout the land. It is not the first time that
</p>
<p>persons have been found to preach peace and to in-
</p>
<p>tend outbreak. An eminent English judge, Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Grose, in passing judgment on Joseph Han-
</p>
<p>son, in the 31st State Trials, page 98, said, " Men

<p>in the year 1836, (the coercion act haying expired)
</p>
<p>and was called " The General Association," having,
</p>
<p>as part of the constitution of that association, (and
</p>
<p>wliich has always been found to be part of this sys-
</p>
<p>tem of agitation,) the collection of whatwas called
</p>
<p>" Justice Rent,"  contributions of which the poor
</p>
<p>inhabitants of this country have been from time to
</p>
<p>time defrauded, and whicli have been spent, nobody
</p>
<p>knows how or has ever heard. It is astonishing
</p>
<p>how the people of this country can have been de-
</p>
<p>luded for suoli a number of years, and have had
</p>
<p>money extorted from them under one pretext and
</p>
<p>device or another from year to year, without ever
</p>
<p>having been informed in what way that money was
</p>
<p>disposed of. The General Association continued up
</p>
<p>to the year 1838. In that year the " Precursor As-
</p>
<p>sociation" was formed, and the Precursor Association
</p>
<p>continued, until the j'eax 1840, to collect money
</p>
<p>from the poor, and to spend it, and to can-y on that
</p>
<p>system of agitation which has been so long the curse
</p>
<p>of this country. You might just awell expect the
</p>
<p>natural body to be in a state of health, operated on
</p>
<p>by incessant stimulants, as that this country could
</p>
<p>be in a state of peace, or tranquillity, or happiness,
</p>
<p>with this constant principle of agitation carried on
</p>
<p>throughout the country from jear to year. I have
</p>
<p>now brought the history of the case down to the
</p>
<p>period of the institution of the present " Repeal
</p>
<p>Association." That association was formed in the
</p>
<p>early part of the month of February (I believe  but
</p>
<p>the month is not very material) of the year 1840.
</p>
<p>It changed its name twice, and it assumed the name
</p>
<p>it has at present in the month of July, 1840, of

<p>tlemen, it will be necessary for me now to bring be-
</p>
<p>fore you the general nature of the constitution of
</p>
<p>this association. It consists of associates, members,
</p>
<p>and volunteers. The class of associates was estab-
</p>
<p>lished with this view, to have some portion of those
</p>
<p>connected with the association liable to pay but
</p>
<p>very small subscriptions, to extend the combination
</p>
<p>throughout the country, and to organize, as far as
</p>
<p>might be, all the poorer classes in the country. Ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, gentlemen, the associate pays only one
</p>
<p>sliilling. A card is given to him (of which I hold
</p>
<p>one in my hand), which answers all the purposes
</p>
<p>without coming within the express language of the
</p>
<p>act of parliament against pass words or signs : it
</p>
<p>enables each person who has tliis card, to show it,
</p>
<p>and to establish to his neighbour, that he is connected
</p>
<p>with the repeal association. There is notliing very
</p>
<p>particular on this card ; there is a shamrock at the
</p>
<p>headj with the words " Catholic, Dissenter, and
</p>
<p>Protestant," and " guis separahit ;"  there is the
</p>
<p>year " 1782 "  lower down near the bottom, a view
</p>
<p>of the Bank of Ireland, formerly the Parliament
</p>
<p>House, with the words " It was and shall be."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the next class in this association are
</p>
<p>what are called members. The members were to
</p>
<p>pay twepty shilhngs ; or if an associate who paid a
</p>
<p>shilling took the trouble of collecting twenty shil-
</p>
<p>lings, that also entitled him to be a member, as well
</p>
<p>as if he had paid the twenty shillings out of his own
</p>
<p>pocket ; to these members a card was issued, the
</p>
<p>bond of union between the members and the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation  to which card I must take leave to call
</p>
<p>your particular attention. Gentlemen, in one cor-
</p>
<p>ner of this card you will find the words "Clontarf,

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.

<p>volunteers of 1782. Keep in recollection the state
</p>
<p>in which the constitution of both countries stood at
</p>
<p>the time ; Ireland had its separate parliament ; the
</p>
<p>parliament of Great Britain had no Irish represen-
</p>
<p>tatives returned to it, and tlie volunteers denied tlie
</p>
<p>power of the English parliament to bind Ireland by
</p>
<p>its laws. Subsequent to that, the act of union
</p>
<p>passed with the consent of the legislatures of both
</p>
<p>countries, the legislature of Great Britain and tlie
</p>
<p>legislature of Ireland, and with the assent of the
</p>
<p>crown. Articles having been agreed to and adopted
</p>
<p>by both legislatures, on which I shall have to ob-
</p>
<p>serve more particularly in the course of my address
</p>
<p>to you. It was provided by the act of union, tliat
</p>
<p>each country should be represented in future for
</p>
<p>ever in a united parliament, to be summoned under
</p>
<p>the great seal of Great Britain ; and is it now said,
</p>
<p>or will it be said, that because in 1782 the Irish
</p>
<p>volunteers denied the right of the English parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, this country being unrepresented therein, to
</p>
<p>make laws to bind Ireland, whicli had a legislature
</p>
<p>of its own, that is to justify a statement on the card
</p>
<p>of the association  that at this time, at this present
</p>
<p>period, the legislature of the united kingdom has
</p>
<p>not authority to make laws to bind both countries ?
</p>
<p>I confidently assert, tliat a proposition denying the
</p>
<p>authority of the legislature of the united kingdom
</p>
<p>to make laws to bind Ireland is illegal. On the
</p>
<p>scroll at the bottom of the card will be found these
</p>
<p>words  "You may make the union a law, but you
</p>
<p>cannot make it binding on conscience ;" and under
</p>
<p>that are these words  "Saurin's speech." I dare
</p>
<p>saj', in the course of this case, you will hear extracts

<p>from speeches delivered by Lord Plunket, and by
</p>
<p>the late Lord Chief Justice of this court; but the
</p>
<p>persons, who so constantly bring those opinions be-
</p>
<p>fore their deluded followers, always omit to state
</p>
<p>this  that these were opinions delivered by those
</p>
<p>distinguished persons in their places in the Irish
</p>
<p>house of commons before the passing of the act of
</p>
<p>union, and that none such ever fell from any of them
</p>
<p>after the act of union had become the law of the
</p>
<p>Ixnd. Gentlemen, there is another class of persons
</p>
<p>in this association of a higher rank than the mem-
</p>
<p>bers. They are persons who have subscribed or
</p>
<p>collected 10  and who thereby become volunteers ;
</p>
<p>and I have a card which I shall exhibit to you,
</p>
<p>which is one of the volunteers' cards, on which is
</p>
<p>engraved  " Volunteers of 1782 revived ;" it is
</p>
<p>signed, " Thomas Mathew Ray, Secretary." There
</p>
<p>is at the head of this engraving a likeness of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell ; there is also one of Mr. Grattan, and
</p>
<p>one of Mr. Flood, and of the two O'Neills, the gene-
</p>
<p>rals who commanded at Benburh and the Yellow
</p>
<p>Ford; of General Saarsfield, and of Brian Boroihme,
</p>
<p>who commanded at Limerick and Clontarf. These
</p>
<p>being the three classes of persons connected with
</p>
<p>the association, namely, associates, members, and
</p>
<p>volunters, it was necessary, for the organization of
</p>
<p>the people of the country, that there should be
</p>
<p>officers of the society ; and accordingly there are
</p>
<p>inspectors, provincial inspectors, bai'onial inspec-
</p>
<p>tors, repeal wardens, and collectors. The repeal
</p>
<p>wardens, by the rules of the association, were to be
</p>
<p>appointed at the recommendation of the clergyman
</p>
<p>of the parish. They were to be appointed, on his
</p>
<p>recommendation, but only by the association itself;

</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside  What is the date of that ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  The 12th of August. In
</p>
<p>the same document he says 
</p>
<p>." The organization must not only be carried every
</p>
<p>where, but it must be revised every where. If the
</p>
<p>liepeal wardens of any district do not see that the
</p>
<p>organization, division, and training of all the Ee-
</p>
<p>pealers in their district is perfect ; if they are not
</p>
<p>sure that the people are qualified by simplicity and
</p>
<p>completeness of organization, by self-denying obe-
</p>
<p>dience, by knowledge of a citizen's duties, by cou-
</p>
<p>rage and habitual order, to take their place among
</p>
<p>the men of a free nation, these wardens have not
</p>
<p>liuished their duty  that district is not ready for
</p>
<p>liberty."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have all heard of the Jacobin
</p>
<p>Club in France, and its affiliated societies. No per-
</p>
<p>son ever contemplated, when that club was first
</p>
<p>established, the consequences to which it led ; but
</p>
<p>it at length succeeded in overturning one govern-
</p>
<p>ment; the government which took the place of that
</p>
<p>which was thus overturned, could not e.xist on the
</p>
<p>principles which gave it birth ; it was followed by
</p>
<p>the establishment of a despotism, which continued,
</p>
<p>as you know, for a series of years. Kecollect the
</p>
<p>injunction of Mr. Duffy to the repeal wardens, that
</p>
<p>if they have not adopted the course which he sug-
</p>
<p>gests, " they have not done their duty  that district
</p>
<p>is not ready for liberty." I cannot abstain, in this
</p>
<p>place, from describing the mischief arising from
</p>
<p>Buch an organization, in the eloquent language of
</p>
<p>that eminent man, the late Lord Chief Justice of
</p>
<p>this court ; he said  " In the case of individuals, the

<p>dual^birt ill the case of associated criminals' r.apid.
</p>
<p>It is the nature of unlawful associations, to' inSu-
</p>
<p>ence the passions of one man by the passions of an-
</p>
<p>other, and to bring into general action the collected
</p>
<p>vices of many. The man whose own temptation or
</p>
<p>frailty would be insufficient to urge him onward in
</p>
<p>the career of guilt, whose own reason or compunc-
</p>
<p>tion might arrest his progress, is borne along with
</p>
<p>the torrent ; bad e-^ample decides him  false shame
</p>
<p>hardens him, and he is precipitated almost neces-
</p>
<p>sarily into crime. It is, therefore, a humane, as
</p>
<p>well as a wise law, which denounces a severe punish-
</p>
<p>ment against every oifence, of whatever nature,
</p>
<p>which is likely to lead to the commission of the
</p>
<p>highest crimes ; and its wisdom has been exempli-
</p>
<p>fied in the history of all those associations. They
</p>
<p>begin by incendiaries spreading among an ignorant
</p>
<p>multitude the spirit of discontent. The inequality
</p>
<p>of human conditions is represented as a grievance ;
</p>
<p>every inconvenience of which they can complain,
</p>
<p>however incident to human society in all countries,
</p>
<p>is denounced as an abuse. They are taught to com-
</p>
<p>bine for the purpose of rectifying all those supposed
</p>
<p>wrongs; every moral principle is rapidly extin-
</p>
<p>guished ; every sense of obligation is lost ; that
</p>
<p>consummation of vice to which an individual slowly
</p>
<p>habituates himself, a conspirator arrives at speedily,
</p>
<p>sometimes in a single day ; and it has often hap-
</p>
<p>pened, that an unfortunate and deluded wretch has
</p>
<p>in the morning joined one of those confederacies as
</p>
<p>the champion of rights, and the redresser of wrongs,
</p>
<p>and the evening sun has set upon him covered with
</p>
<p>crimes." Such is the description of conspiracy, and

<p>the result of associations of this kind, by that gifted

<p>in the country. The roads were a kind of defiles ;
</p>
<p>and if the congregated powers of Russia endeavoured
</p>
<p>to pour out its force upon Ireland, and if Irishmen
</p>
<p>were led by their own countrymen, they would fling
</p>
<p>the invaders from their cliffs into the sea, and thus
</p>
<p>disenthral the land from her oppressors."
</p>
<p>Thus you have the " congregated powers of
</p>
<p>Kussia" alluded to. How could Russia be the op-
</p>
<p>pressor of Ireland ? Is it not clear, that what was
</p>
<p>intended to be conveyed was tliis  " If the congre-
</p>
<p>gated powers of England endeavour to pour out its
</p>
<p>forces on Ireland, and if Irishmen were led by their
</p>
<p>own leaders, that they would fling the invaders from
</p>
<p>their cliifs into the sea, and thus disenthral the land
</p>
<p>from'i'herioppressors?" You will find in the course
</p>
<p>of this cause, that England is the power designated
</p>
<p>as the oppressor of Ireland ; and recollect, that the
</p>
<p>inflammatory language used on the, different occa-
</p>
<p>sions I shall have , to advert to, was circulated
</p>
<p>throughout the country, by the instrumentality of
</p>
<p>the repeal press, and by the repeal wardens dis-
</p>
<p>charging the duties prescribed to them in their in-
</p>
<p>structions from the association to circulate these
</p>
<p>newspapers in every district, and takje care to get
</p>
<p>them read by as many persons as possible. In this
</p>
<p>way the misguided population of the country has
</p>
<p>been incited against the English people, ,who, you
</p>
<p>Will hereafter find, have been called " Saxon
</p>
<p>foreigners." You have the state of Ireland as a
</p>
<p>military position pointed out, " every field a redoubt,
</p>
<p>every road a defile, places where the cavalry cannot
</p>
<p>act against her infantry ;" and the inquh-y is made,
</p>
<p>why should not the Irish, led by their own country-
</p>
<p>men, upon the next occasion, repel their oppressors

<p>and disenthral their country ? I have now to bring
</p>
<p>under your notice a publication of Mr. Barrett's, one
</p>
<p>of the defendants, the editor of the Pilot newspaper,
</p>
<p>one who, you will find m the course of this case, has
</p>
<p>been taking a prominent part in this conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>endeavouring to aid, as far as he could, through the
</p>
<p>columns of his newspaper, and otherwise, in excit-
</p>
<p>ing discontent and disaffection amongst the people
</p>
<p>of this country. You will recollect, that the Pilot
</p>
<p>was one of the three-day papers mentioned in the
</p>
<p>instructions to repeal wardens to be circulated
</p>
<p>gratis in any district subscribing 20/. ; it being the
</p>
<p>duty of the repeal warden to take care that this
</p>
<p>paper should be read by as manV of the deluded
</p>
<p>population of this country as possible. This paper
</p>
<p>bears date on the 10th March, 1848 ; it purports to
</p>
<p>give an account of a repeal meeting at Washington,
</p>
<p>in the United States of America. (The proceedings
</p>
<p>at that meeting are reported at length ; I am not
</p>
<p>about to trouble you with the whole of them, but I
</p>
<p>shall, as a specimen, read a short extract from the
</p>
<p>speech made by Mr. Tyler, the son of the President
</p>
<p>of the United States, before I read Mr. Barrett's
</p>
<p>commentary on that speech. What I now state is
</p>
<p>an extract from Mr. Tyler's speech :

<p>"When Jre see that that people" (.that is the Irish

<p>people) _" amount to nine millions  and when we
</p>
<p>know they are brave in the field, eloquent in the

<p>senate, wise in the cabinet, united and determmed
</p>
<p>to be free, we cannot suppose for a moment their
</p>
<p>freedom is impossible, or even difficult, the libation
</p>
<p>to freedom must sometimes be quaffed in blood.

<p>The Irish heart he looked upon as true freedom's

</p>
<p>quired the habit of collecting from great distauces,
</p>
<p>on orders given ; of coming to these meetings in
</p>
<p>military organization and array  and when the dis-
</p>
<p>cipline should be perfect, and the convenient time
</p>
<p>should have arrived. There was nothing new in
</p>
<p>this plan. It will be found, I believe, that every
</p>
<p>stage in this conspiracy had its precedent. The same
</p>
<p>course was adopted in 1797, previous to therebeUion.
</p>
<p>It is a matter of history. It is reported by the Com-
</p>
<p>mittee of Secrecy, a committee appointed by the
</p>
<p>House of Commons in 1798, to inquire into the mat-
</p>
<p>ters connected with the breaking out of that rebel-
</p>
<p>lion; and in that report to parUament, the com-
</p>
<p>mittee stated, " The next measure to which your
</p>
<p>committee beg leave to point the attention of the
</p>
<p>house, is the proclamation of the Lord Lieutenant
</p>
<p>and Council, bearing date the 6th of November,
</p>
<p>1796, issued in consequence of the disaffected hav-
</p>
<p>ing adopted a practice of marching in military
</p>
<p>array, and assembling in large bodies, in some
</p>
<p>instances to the amount of several thousands,
</p>
<p>imder the pretence of saving corn and digging
</p>
<p>potatoes, but in fact to terrify the peaceable and
</p>
<p>well-disposed, and to compel them to enter into
</p>
<p>their treasonable associations. The same sys-
</p>
<p>tem has since frequently been had recourse to by
</p>
<p>the United Irishmen in other parts of the kingdom,
</p>
<p>under various pretences, such as funerals, foot-ball
</p>
<p>meetings, &c. with a view of display ing their strength,
</p>
<p>giving the people the habit of attending from great
</p>
<p>distances upon an order being issued, and making
</p>
<p>them more accustomed to show themselves in sup-
</p>
<p>port of the cause." That was the plan of organi-
</p>
<p>zation before the breaking out of the rebellion in

</p>
<p>1798; and it is on that precedent that these, multi-
</p>
<p>tudiuous meetings have been assembled in this coun-
</p>
<p>try during the course of this last year. The earliest
</p>
<p>meeting to which I sliaU call your attention was
</p>
<p>held at Trim. I believe it was the first meeting held
</p>
<p>in the year 1843, of those which have been since
</p>
<p>called " monster meetings ;" but it was a meeting
</p>
<p>of very little importance as compared with some of
</p>
<p>those which took place, as the conspiracy became
</p>
<p>developed. There were present at that meeting,
</p>
<p>which was held on the 16th of March, three of the
</p>
<p>defendants, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele. It is said there were about thirty thousand
</p>
<p>persons present. There was a dinner at Trim on
</p>
<p>the same day, at which some of the leaders, of those
</p>
<p>who had induced these congregrated thousands to
</p>
<p>meet in the morning, were present. The toast of
</p>
<p>" the People" having been given, Mr. Barrett, the
</p>
<p>defendant, returned thanks ; and in the concluding
</p>
<p>passage of his speech he adverted to the progress
</p>
<p>which repeal had made, and the certaintj' of its suc-
</p>
<p>cess, situated as England was abroad and at home ;
</p>
<p>and he ended by calling on the people " to be united,
</p>
<p>tranquilly resolved, and .generally organized, and
</p>
<p>when they were, Ireland had but to stamp her foot,
</p>
<p>and she would repeal the union." Tliis is the legal,
</p>
<p>constitutional, and peaceable mode, by which this
</p>
<p>great alteration in the relation between the different
</p>
<p>parts of the United Kingdom is to be effected 
</p>
<p>pretty well coinciding \vith what Mr. Duffy stated
</p>
<p>in his publication, which I have already adverted
</p>
<p>to. If the repeal wardens have not done all that he
</p>
<p>States, "that parish is not ready for liberty." But

<p>when every parish is "ready for liberty," then Ire-

<p>ther singular if petitions were presented from a
</p>
<p>meeting, the leader of which stated that nothing
</p>
<p>was to be hoped for from- that constitutional body,
</p>
<p>which alone could accord legally the objects of those
</p>
<p>assemblages. We all know, since these prosecu-
</p>
<p>tions commenced that there has been great activity
</p>
<p>in purchasing parchment, in order to get rid of the
</p>
<p>consequences arising from the notorious fact, that
</p>
<p>there was no petition during last session to parlia-
</p>
<p>ment from any monster meeting. Gentlemen, some-
</p>
<p>thing more than a year ago, a newspaper was esta-
</p>
<p>blished in this city, the proprietor of which is one
</p>
<p>of the defendants, Mr. Duffy ; that newspaper, you
</p>
<p>are all aware, is the Nation. You also liave it in
</p>
<p>recollection, that a principle of the association was,
</p>
<p>to circulate these papers as widely as possible.
</p>
<p>There is a saying which has almost become a pro-
</p>
<p>verb  " I shall leave to you the making of the laws,
</p>
<p>if you give to me the writing of the ballads ;" and
</p>
<p>accordingly the writing and publishing of seditious
</p>
<p>poetry has been recently carried on in this country
</p>
<p>to a great extent. In the book to which I adverted
</p>
<p>just now, the Keport of the Committee of Secrecy,
</p>
<p>in the year 1797, 1 find in the newspaper of the day,
</p>
<p>The Press, ballads, and poetry of a most seditious
</p>
<p>character; and it has been thought advisable, at
</p>
<p>the present time, to follow the same course, and to
</p>
<p>spread the poison through the columns of the Nation,
</p>
<p>a paper widely circulated by the repeal association.
</p>
<p>The ballads have been so numerous, that they have
</p>
<p>been published in a small volume, entitled " The
</p>
<p>Spirit of the Nation." I am not about to trouble
</p>
<p>you with more than one specimen, but that speci-
</p>

<p>Irish people. The earliest publication of the Na-

<p>poems ; it appeared in the Nation newspaper in
</p>
<p>April last, and is entitled,

<p>" THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD.

<p>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>129
</p>
<p>Premature iusurrections ! Wait till the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion has arrived at the point that every " parish is
</p>
<p>ready for liberty." " Rapid, uniform, and careful
</p>
<p>orgaifeation for the repeal agitation, charity, and
</p>
<p>conciliation, and a strict observance of the law, are
</p>
<p>the pressing and present duties of every Irishman."
</p>
<p>The present duty of every Irishman is the obser-
</p>
<p>rauce of the law. One of the mottoes of the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation is tliis  "He who commits a crime gives
</p>
<p>strength to the enemy." The enemy is, " the Saxon
</p>
<p>foreigner"  the person from whose ruthless gripe
</p>
<p>you are, when the moment arrives, to extricate
</p>
<p>yourselves ; but your " present duty" is " a strict
</p>
<p>observance of the law."
</p>
<p>" Thus shall we baffle our foes ! We have
</p>
<p>been led into this train of thought by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's proposal to form an association of three hun-
</p>
<p>dred men of trust, to consider and prepare a bill for
</p>
<p>the repeal of the union. If we dislilced his present
</p>
<p>design we should at once express our dissent, for
</p>
<p>candour and fair dealing are the first of all duties in
</p>
<p>times like these. If the people, flattered at the
</p>
<p>thought of a new plan, blindly appoint as the trus-
</p>
<p>tees of their subscriptions, cowards, blockheads,
</p>
<p>knaves, or bigots ; if these trustees are not confided
</p>
<p>in, no matter what they may will or do, and if they
</p>
<p>are not supported to the last shilling, and the last
</p>
<p>man, the attempt will only come crushing back on
</p>
<p>us in shame and ruin. But if the people go on
</p>
<p>meeting, organizing, collecting, and conciliating 
</p>
<p>if they trust their contributions to bold, faithful,
</p>
<p>educated, and tolerant men, and if they stand by
</p>
<p>those they trust, without cavil or flinching, Ireland
</p>
<p>will soon be a nation."

</p>
<p>In the same number of that journal, there is
</p>
<p>another article, to which I must also beg your
</p>
<p>particular attention. It is entitled, " Our Nation-
</p>
<p>ality :" 
</p>
<p>" The olive growth of nationality is overspreading
</p>
<p>the provinces, and taking permanent root in the
</p>
<p>heart of the land. Assured millions gather round it,
</p>
<p>watcliing its progress and its strength with straining
</p>
<p>eyes ; and cold were his heart who sees its beauty un-
</p>
<p>moved, whose heart yearneth not for its saving shade.
</p>
<p>There is yet work to be done, danger to be dared, and
</p>
<p>difficulty to be removed. These are to be met and
</p>
<p>triumphed over. Every successive step, as it becomes
</p>
<p>more momen tous, becomes more perilous, and requires
</p>
<p>corresponding caution, courage and virtue. Our
</p>
<p>enemy may be aroused, and so must Ireland. The
</p>
<p>county of Tipperary is on its peaceful parade. There
</p>
<p>are to be two meetings, one in each riding. Neither is
</p>
<p>meant for show. The multitude will not come to
</p>
<p>gaze and shout and return to a listless indifference
</p>
<p>of their country's fate. They will come pledged to
</p>
<p>purchase its redemption at whatever cost. The two
</p>
<p>meetings will come off" on the 23d and 25th of May,
</p>
<p>and if we be not misinformed, these days will form
</p>
<p>a meaning era in the struggle for native liberty.
</p>
<p>Twenty thousand Tipperary men, who would as
</p>
<p>soon, if called on, pay their blood as their subscrip-
</p>
<p>tions, would not form a bad national guard for Ire-
</p>
<p>land."
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, at this stage of the proceedings
</p>
<p>it may be right, having already stated to you what
</p>
<p>the opinion of the late government was with respect
</p>
<p>to the question of the repeal of the union, to recal
</p>
<p>to your recollection what took place about this time,
</p>
<p>130
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>crouch, but it will be the crouch of the tiger, ready-
</p>
<p>to take the sure hut terrihle spring, aud clutch our
</p>
<p>independence."
</p>
<p>He proceeds then, and in another place says 
</p>
<p>" With such a cause, such a leader, people, and
</p>
<p>clergy, -who will despair ? Irislunen, proceed then
</p>
<p>in the mighty worli before you. To recede were
</p>
<p>ruin. Be firm and you triumph  hesitate and you
</p>
<p>faU."
</p>
<p>At the same dinner Bishop Cantwell said 
</p>
<p>" That they had long enough tried in vain to ob-
</p>
<p>tain justice from England, and that it was time they
</p>
<p>should endeavour to riglit themselves."
</p>
<p>And Bishop Higgins said 
</p>
<p>" I do not claim any distinction as standing by
</p>
<p>the Liberator on the great question of national inde-
</p>
<p>pendence.  I entertain the opinion in common with
</p>
<p>all the hierarchy of Ireland. Some fi-om delicacy of
</p>
<p>health, and some from an unwillingness to mingle in
</p>
<p>politics, may not have yet formally declared them-
</p>
<p>selves I say all are repealers. Let the foolish mi-
</p>
<p>nister threaten  I dare, I defy him, to crush repeal
</p>
<p>agitation in the diocese of Ardagh. And if the
</p>
<p>scaffold were my lot I would bequeath my wrongs
</p>
<p>to my successor.".
</p>
<p>That, I think, is strong language to fall from two
</p>
<p>ministers of a Cliristian church. The next meeting
</p>
<p>to which I shall call your attention, is the meeting
</p>
<p>held at Cork, on the "21 st of May. At that meeting
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele were present. It is
</p>
<p>said tliat five hundred thousand pei-sons assembled
</p>
<p>at that meeting ; the meeting assembled in the same
</p>
<p>manner as the former multitudinous meetings, with
</p>
<p>the same object, and with the same design, to accus-

<p>tom thousands to come from remote distances, to
</p>
<p>come at the issuing of orders given for the purpose,
</p>
<p>to accustom them to obey the command of their
</p>
<p>leaders, to get them into a state of organiza,tion,
</p>
<p>marcliing to meetings, headed by bands in militaiy
</p>
<p>array, so that when the time for action should arrive,
</p>
<p>they might be " ready to come again." At the din-
</p>
<p>ner, winch took place after that meeting, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell said 
</p>
<p>" I have been, while addressing you, looking into
</p>
<p>your minds, exchanging tliat mental sympathy with
</p>
<p>you wliich I feel within me. Oh ! to think that in
</p>
<p>the year 1843, the repeal year, the rent should have
</p>
<p>accumulated from fifty-six pounds to six hundred
</p>
<p>and ninety-four pounds per week ; and I hope that
</p>
<p>on Monday ne.xt, or some succeeding day, it will
</p>
<p>close on a thousand, and perhaps more." (A voice 
</p>
<p>" More power to you.")
</p>
<p>And in a subsequent part he said 
</p>
<p>" Let them attaci: us ; and if they do, and that
</p>
<p>some penniless, shoeless Irisliman found his way, on
</p>
<p>the deck of a steamer, to Manchester or St. Giles's,
</p>
<p>and collected a number of Irishmen about him, and
</p>
<p>one should ask him 'whatne'vs?' to wbichhe would

<p>reply, 'your father was cut down by a dragoon,
</p>
<p>your mother was shot by a policeman, or your sister
</p>
<p>; but I would not say what has happened to
</p>
<p>her ; she is now a wandering maniac' Let him say
</p>
<p>but that, and I will ask Peel how many fires would
</p>
<p>blaze out in the manufactories of England ? No ;
</p>
<p>they must listen to us. They shall not attempt to
</p>
<p>massacre us. No ; the hangman will be disap-
</p>
<p>pointed. We are safe, for Ireland reposes in peace.

</p>
<p>read, although in fact they were a repetition very
</p>
<p>much of what he said at Cork. He commences by
</p>
<p>an allusion to Lord Beaumont, a Koman Catholic
</p>
<p>peer of England, and thus proceeds : 
</p>
<p>" I ask you, mongrel, heartless Beaumont, do yon
</p>
<p>want it to go through the people of Ireland, that
</p>
<p>you would support the English minister, if he had
</p>
<p>been mad enough to make war upon the Catholics
</p>
<p>of Ireland ? Suppose some Irish Paddy had escaped
</p>
<p>from the slaughter, and going over to London, had
</p>
<p>met some of his former neighbours, they would ask
</p>
<p>him the news ; but what would be the tidings he
</p>
<p>would have to bring them? He would hear that
</p>
<p>you were one of the men who hallooed on the de-
</p>
<p>stroyers of the peace of his home. Oh 1 you would be
</p>
<p>very safe that evening  would you not. Lord Beau-
</p>
<p>mont? The manufactories in your neighbourhood
</p>
<p>would be safe too ; and proud London herself, in
</p>
<p>which you would flatter yourself with the hope of
</p>
<p>being secure, would be also safe, when the account
</p>
<p>of the ruin of Ireland would arrive. No ; one \Aa,7e
</p>
<p>of powerful fire would reach through her vast extent,
</p>
<p>and in the destruction of England would vindicate
</p>
<p>the country of the maddened and persecuted Irish-
</p>
<p>man who would have reached her shores."
</p>
<p>Now, I would ask, did you, upon any occasion,
</p>
<p>in the course of your lives, ever hear of so inflamma-
</p>
<p>tory a speech  so calculated to excite the strongest
</p>
<p>feelings of an excitable population ? In that speech,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell is represented as calling the soldiery
</p>
<p>of England, " the ruffian soldiery of Britain." But
</p>
<p>you will find just now, that he corrected that state-
</p>
<p>ment, and represented it as a misapprehension, and
</p>
<p>that he had never called them " a ruffian soldiery."

</p>
<p>Why he corrected the statement as to the soldierj',
</p>
<p>you will perfectly understand before I have closed
</p>
<p>this case. Gentlemen, on the 30th of May, a meet-
</p>
<p>ing of the repeal association took place ; there were
</p>
<p>present five of the defendants, Mr. O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, Dr. Gray, Mr. Eay, and Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell. It was at that meeting that Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>took occasion to correct the report of his having
</p>
<p>called the soldiery of Britain " a ruffian soldiery ;"
</p>
<p>and I call your attention to that correction on Ms
</p>
<p>part, for reasons which you will understand as the
</p>
<p>case proceeds. Jlr. O'Connell said : 
</p>
<p>" He had to correct a typographical mistake which
</p>
<p>occurred in the admirable report in the Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal of the proceedings in Longford. He was
</p>
<p>made to say this, ' No, your sister watched Ms
</p>
<p>corpse, but she is herself worse than dead  she is
</p>
<p>now a sad maniac roaming through the wilds, and,
</p>
<p>like the wretched maniac of song, warning her sex
</p>
<p>against the ruffian soldier}' of Britain.' He did not
</p>
<p>call the soldiery of Britain a ruffian soldiery  he
</p>
<p>would not call them so, because it would be false.
</p>
<p>They were, on the contrary, an extremely civilized
</p>
<p>class of men, and he expressed more than once that
</p>
<p>he never now saw a soldier in the dock charged with
</p>
<p>any crime. He also spoke of the sergeants, whom he
</p>
<p>thought an exceedingly well-informed and well-con-
</p>
<p>ducted body of men, and to them the discipline of
</p>
<p>the entire army fell (hear). If justice were done
</p>
<p>to them, there was not a company in which one
</p>
<p>of them ought not to be raised to the rank of an
</p>
<p>officer."
</p>
<p>It maybe right to observe, gentlemen, that in the
</p>
<p>Pilot of the 31st of May, Mr. Barrett takes occasion
</p>
<p>132
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>three cheers for the Queen's army, the bravest army
</p>
<p>in the world ; and stated that 
</p>
<p>" Tlie class of sergeants it contains is the most
</p>
<p>educated in existence ; and I trust the day will ar-
</p>
<p>rive when the sergeants will be in a fair way of
</p>
<p>becoming commissioned officers."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, on the same day there was a dinner,
</p>
<p>at which Mr. O'Conuell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell, were present. At that dinner Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>uell made the following observations with respect
</p>
<p>to the meeting which had taken place in the
</p>
<p>morning 
</p>
<p>" What a waste of physical force have we not
</p>
<p>witnessed to-day ? We stand at the head of a
</p>
<p>body of men that, if organised by military discipline,
</p>
<p>would be quite .abundautfor the conquest of Europe.
</p>
<p>Oh, but it will be said, they were not disciplined.
</p>
<p>Do you not think they were as well able to walk in
</p>
<p>order after a band as if they wore red coats, and
</p>
<p>that they would be as ready to obey their repeal
</p>
<p>wardens, as if they were called sergeants and cap-
</p>
<p>tains?"
</p>
<p>This speech of Mr. O'Connell's you will find to
</p>
<p>accord with Mr. Duffy's opinion in a publication
</p>
<p>^vhich I shall have to advert to more fully in the
</p>
<p>course of my address, and in which he states that 
</p>
<p>" If the repeal wardens in any district do not see
</p>
<p>that the organization, division, and training of all
</p>
<p>the repealers in their district is perfect  if they are
</p>
<p>not sure that the people are qualified by simplicity
</p>
<p>and completeness of organization  by self-denying
</p>
<p>obedience  by knowledge of all a citizen's duties 
</p>
<p>by courage and habitual order  to take their place
</p>

</p>
<p>not finished their duty  that district is not ready
</p>
<p>for liberty."
</p>
<p>1 now beg to call your attention to a publication
</p>
<p>which appeared a few days after this in the Nation,
</p>
<p>a newspaper, of which one of the defendants, Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy, is the proprietor. The date is the lOth of
</p>
<p>June. The last meeting I spoke of was held on the
</p>
<p>8th of June. In two days after we have this pub-
</p>
<p>lication of Mr. Dufiy ; and I think you will now
</p>
<p>pretty well see the community of purpose, and the
</p>
<p>community of design, of the several parties. The
</p>
<p>article is headed " The Morality of War ;" it might
</p>
<p>more properly have been headed, " The Morality of
</p>
<p>Kebellion." It begins 
</p>
<p>" We have received through that excellent gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, Mr. Haughton, a letter from Mr. Ebenezer
</p>
<p>Shackleton, expostulating through him with the re-
</p>
<p>peal association, for putting the glorious names of
</p>
<p>Benburb, Limerick, Beal-an-Atha-Buidh, and Clon-
</p>
<p>tarf on the repeal card."
</p>
<p>These were the names of the four battles I ad-
</p>
<p>verted to, in calling your attention to the members'
</p>
<p>card.
</p>
<p>" For these names he would substitute tempe-
</p>
<p>rance, peace, and the like. Now, we have much re-
</p>
<p>spect for tills gentleman's opinions, but we entirely
</p>
<p>dissent from them. Unjust war is, like all other
</p>
<p>tmjust things, very wicked and condemuable. But
</p>
<p>a just war is as noble to him who has justice on his
</p>
<p>side, as any other j ust act  nay, it is more noble.
</p>
<p>Bnt his cause must be good to justify our unqua-
</p>
<p>lified praise of the soldier. If he fight to rob or op-

<p>vided, when the Saxon first polluted her verdant
</p>
<p>soil with his accursed foot. I hope my dream of
</p>
<p>conflict will never be realized  that it is an empty
</p>
<p>vision ; but let none of us be to blame  let us stand
</p>
<p>shoulder to shoulder on the constitution  and let
</p>
<p>not Ireland be abandoned to her foes, by the folly,
</p>
<p>the passions, or the treachery of her children."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I shall now bring you to a most im-
</p>
<p>portant meeting ; important, because I believe it is
</p>
<p>the first meeting at which the assertion was made
</p>
<p>by Mr. O'Connell to the assembled people, of the
</p>
<p>possibility of having the union repealed without the
</p>
<p>aid of the united legislature. This he boldly and'
</p>
<p>confidently laid .down as the law ; and I shall wait
</p>
<p>with anxious attention to hear whether, amongst his
</p>
<p>numerous counsel, he can get one man who will
</p>
<p>venture to re-afiirm his proposition. And yet you
</p>
<p>have the deluded people of this country told, that
</p>
<p>they need not look to parliament for the purpose of
</p>
<p>eflecting their object ; that it can be legally ob-

</p>
<p>tained without its aid. I ask you now, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>to remember my words. I cannot say that the
</p>
<p>proposition will not be re-aflSrmed  but it will
</p>
<p>excite surprise in my mind, if in the face of
</p>
<p>the country, if in the face of the legal profes-
</p>
<p>sion, if in the face of this high court, such a pro-
</p>
<p>position be repeated, which 1 denounce as illegal,
</p>
<p>unconstitutional, and unsustainable. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>this meeting was held at Dundalk on the 29th of
</p>
<p>June. There were seven temperance bands, all in
</p>
<p>uniform, and the same organization as at the other
</p>
<p>meetings. There were several thousand persons
</p>
<p>collected. Amongst the banners was a tri-coloured
</p>
<p>flag, with " Ireland's masses resisting her foes." On
</p>
<p>the same day a dinner took place, at which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell spoke : 
</p>
<p>" We have ascertained that the Irish nation wills
</p>
<p>the repeal of the union, but still I do not cease my
</p>
<p>exertioQS in calling together thousands of others. I
</p>
<p>do not cease or terminate these exertions with this
</p>
<p>day. It may be asked why I should take the super-
</p>
<p>fluous trouble of attending other meetings ; but I
</p>
<p>attend them, not to convince myself or you that
</p>
<p>Ireland is with me, but to convince our' enemies  to
</p>
<p>convince the British statesmen  to make the Duke
</p>
<p>of Wellington aware of it, bothered as the poor old
</p>
<p>man is. I want to make all Europe and America
</p>
<p>know it  I want to make England feel her weakness
</p>
<p>if she refuses to give us the justice we require, the
</p>
<p>restoration of our domestic parliament."
</p>
<p>In another place he says :  I
</p>
<p>" But do they imagine that I intend to stop at
</p>
<p>calling those meetings? They are satisfying both
</p>
<p>friends aitd foes that the nation is with me  man

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>in force and have effect for ever, from the first day
</p>
<p>of January, which shall be in the year of our
</p>
<p>Lord one thousand eight hundred and one." Thus
</p>
<p>we have those articles ratified, approved, and con-
</p>
<p>firmed by the parliament of Ireland  one of those
</p>
<p>articles being, as I stated to you, that the United
</p>
<p>Kingdom be represented in one and the same par-
</p>
<p>liament, to be styled the "United Parliament of
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Ireland." And in direct opposi-
</p>
<p>tion to this statute of the King, Lords, and Com-
</p>
<p>mons of this country, confirmed by an act of the
</p>
<p>jEnglish legislature, containing these distinct provi-
</p>
<p>sions uniting the parliament of both countries for
</p>
<p>ever, you are told that it is part of the prerogative
</p>
<p>of the crown, without the assent of the parliament
</p>
<p>of the United Kingdom, to summon an Irish par-
</p>
<p>liament ; and you are told that no person can deny
</p>
<p>this, who does not deny the Queen's title to the
</p>
<p>throne. Unless the act of union be void, this right
</p>
<p>does not exist in the crown ; and I ask again, is there
</p>
<p>a gentleman amongst the numerous counsel on the
</p>
<p>other side, who will state that th e act of union is void ?
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell  Yes, there is.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  Unless they go that
</p>
<p>length, it is utterly impossible to say that the prero-
</p>
<p>gative is vested in the crown of issuing writs to
</p>
<p>summon an Irish parliament. I am aware it has
</p>
<p>been stated by one of the defendants, on different
</p>
<p>occasions, that the act of union is void ; but unless
</p>
<p>counsel assert that this act of parliament is abso-
</p>
<p>lutely and legally null and void, I reiterate the as-
</p>
<p>sertion that no lawyer can now say that the prero-
</p>
<p>gative is vested in the crown to summon an Irish
</p>
<p>parliament. It is a wicked delusion practised on the

</p>
<p>people of this country, to tell them that the repeal
</p>
<p>of the union can be obtained without the sanction of
</p>
<p>parliament. Gentlemen, the next meeting to which
</p>
<p>I shall call your attention, is one that took place at
</p>
<p>Donnybrook on the 3rd of July. Several thousand
</p>
<p>persons assembled at that place. There were pre-
</p>
<p>sent Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>and Dr. Gray. At that meeting Mr. O'ConneU
</p>
<p>spoke, and amongst other observations he made the
</p>
<p>following : 
</p>
<p>" What a glorious sight is here. I have more
</p>
<p>strength, more physical force than gained the battle
</p>
<p>of Waterloo. 1 have more physical force than ever
</p>
<p>monarch commanded or general led. All that is
</p>
<p>requisite is to manage our strength. Let there be
</p>
<p>no riot, no violence, no tumult, no breach of the
</p>
<p>peace  (no, no.) Let us exhibit sobriety, order,
</p>
<p>tranquillity  all crowned by immortal and imperish-
</p>
<p>able determination."
</p>
<p>Upon that occasion, as upon various others, it was
</p>
<p>impressed upon the minds of the people that there
</p>
<p>should be no riot, no violence. You will find just
</p>
<p>now that the defendant, Mr. Duffy, in one of Ms
</p>
<p>publications, stated that the absence of riot and
</p>
<p>violence made each of the meetings a strange and
</p>
<p>formidable event. It is obvious that the conspiracy
</p>
<p>could not have been carried on for an hour, if there
</p>
<p>had been riot or violence until the period should
</p>
<p>arrive when the signal was to be given. It is for
</p>
<p>that reason, and in order to complete the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion, that every thing was to be peaceable. The
</p>
<p>maxim of the association being, that " He who com-
</p>
<p>mits a crime gives strength to the enemy." In ano-
</p>
<p>ther part he says 
</p>
<p>THE ATTOENEY-GENEEAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>135
</p>
<p>gether an Irish parliament. Now, gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>again reiterate my denial of that right. The crown
</p>
<p>has not that prerogative. The act of union is valid;
</p>
<p>and I think it is somewhat singular, that the inva-
</p>
<p>lidity of that act of imion should be asserted by
</p>
<p>Irishmen, when, if it be invalid, the acts of the
</p>
<p>united legislature are also invalid, and amongst
</p>
<p>others the act for the relief of the Roman Catholics
</p>
<p>of Ireland. If the act of union he a nullity, every
</p>
<p>act passed by the parliament of the United King-
</p>
<p>dom, so far at least as Ireland is concerned, is void.
</p>
<p>And, gentlemen, I ask you, if I am not justified
</p>
<p>here in complaining, that the people of this country
</p>
<p>should he deluded into the supposition, that opinions
</p>
<p>were entertaiaed by such men as Saurin, Plunket,
</p>
<p>and Bushe, they never having, after the passing of
</p>
<p>the act of union, questioned the validity of that act.
</p>
<p>Any observations that fell from them were legi-
</p>
<p>timate and fair and proper, being made in their
</p>
<p>places in parhameut, when they were resisting the
</p>
<p>passing of the bill. But it is most unwarrantable
</p>
<p>to refer to those opinions as a justification for the
</p>
<p>assertion that the act of union, after it had passed is
</p>
<p>void. Gentlemen, you are aware that at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing which took place at Donnybrook, Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell adverted in the course of his observations, to a
</p>
<p>remittance which he had received from America ;
</p>
<p>and accordingly on the 4th of July, in accordance
</p>
<p>with his previous statement, a meeting was held 'at
</p>
<p>the association, at which were present Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, Mr. John O'ConneU, Mr. Bay, Mr. Steele, and
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray. That day was selected for handing in
</p>
<p>1100/. as the subscription from the sympathizing
</p>
<p>Americans, because it was the anniversary of Ame-

<p>rican Independence. I shall now call your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to what was stated by Mr. O'ConneU at this
</p>
<p>meeting. He said 
</p>
<p>" I shall next proceed to hand in the money from
</p>
<p>America. It is an auspicious day for the purpose 
</p>
<p>it is the anniversary of the glorious revolution in
</p>
<p>America  (here there was a cheer.) That cheer
</p>
<p>(continued Mr. O'ConneU) will be wafted over the
</p>
<p>Atlantic and be heard amongst the hiUs of America.
</p>
<p>America did not turn violently upon England. She
</p>
<p>submitted to her grievances as long as they could
</p>
<p>be endured ; and it was not till compelled by the
</p>
<p>conduct of George the Third, as great a tyrant as
</p>
<p>ever sat upon a throne  not till her domestic rights
</p>
<p>were violated by him, that she shook oflf tlie yoke
</p>
<p>of England. England has, I hope, since grown
</p>
<p>wiser  at least I know that she is weaker, and Ire-
</p>
<p>land is too strong to be her slave." .
</p>
<p>He then handed in the sum of llOOZ. which he
</p>
<p>had mentioned on the preceding day. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the next meeting to which I shall advert, took place
</p>
<p>at Tullamore, on the 16th of July. There were
</p>
<p>present at that meetiag Mr. O'ConneU, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray. Twelve bands attended
</p>
<p>in uniform. They came from the King's County,
</p>
<p>and Queen's County, the counties of Westmeath
</p>
<p>and Tipperary. It is said one hundred and fifty
</p>
<p>thousand persons were present at that meeting.
</p>
<p>There were flags and banners ; and amongst other
</p>
<p>inscriptions  " Ireland her parUament, or the world
</p>
<p>in a blaze." On another flag  " Ireland must not
</p>
<p>be, and ought not be, a serf nation." At this meet-
</p>
<p>ing the Rev. Mr. Kearney spoke, and made, amongst
</p>
<p>others, the following observations : 
</p>
<p>135
</p>
<p>f HE IRISH STATE TEIALS.
</p>
<p>" The strength of their enemies was shattered,
</p>
<p>they were distracted, and divided in their weakness,
</p>
<p>and if the people had the grace and the skill to make
</p>
<p>their adversaries' infirmity the opportunity of their
</p>
<p>own liberty, the good fight was fought  the "goal of
</p>
<p>freedom was won, and Ireland was again a nation.
</p>
<p>America sent lier voice of thunder careering over
</p>
<p>the illimitable waters of the great Atlantic to tell
</p>
<p>them they were justified in all their proceedings.
</p>
<p>Admiring France looked on with breathless interest,
</p>
<p>and all Europe had her eye fixed with an intensity of
</p>
<p>vision on tlie magnificent demonstrations in favom"
</p>
<p>of liberty whereof Ireland was now the theatre. He
</p>
<p>would be happy if he saw his country free. Oh ! let
</p>
<p>them resolve as one man to achieve her freedom, and
</p>
<p>the day of her glory was assured. Oh I give a por-
</p>
<p>tion of your heing to your country. You would
</p>
<p>give her all your blood, if it was a battle to the
</p>
<p>death. Pray for her  toil for her incessantly  she
</p>
<p>is worth your prayers, she is worth your toil,
</p>
<p>" Oh 1 Ireland, Ireland, shall it be my lot.
</p>
<p>To raise my victor head, and see
</p>
<p>Thy hills, thy dales, thy people free.
</p>
<p> That glance of bliss is all I crave
</p>
<p>Between my labours and ray grave."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, a meetingtook place]of the association
</p>
<p>on the 26th of July, at which were present, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Eay, Doctor
</p>
<p>Gray, and Mr. Steele. The proceedings had re-
</p>
<p>ference to the Irish Society, and the mode by which
</p>
<p>their property was to be in effect confiscated. I do
</p>
<p>not think at this hour of the evening I should bejus-
</p>
<p>tified in reading the proceedings to you.

</p>
<p>TRZRS DAY.
</p>
<p>Wednesday, January 17.
</p>
<p>The court sat at 10 o'clock a.m., and the jury
</p>
<p>having all answered.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General then resumed as follows : 
</p>
<p>My lords and gentlemen of the jury  On the 6th of
</p>
<p>August last there was a meeting at Baltinglass, in
</p>
<p>the county of Wicklow. At that meeting tliree of
</p>
<p>the defendants were present : Mr. O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, and Dr. Gray. There were many thousand
</p>
<p>persons at the meeting ; some of the defendants calcu-
</p>
<p>lated the numbers at one hundred and fifty thousand.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell addressed the meeting, and said : 
</p>
<p>" And shall they tell me, that that parliament,
</p>
<p>which by force and fraud was extorted from us, is
</p>
<p>never to revive again, and that Ireland alone is to be
</p>
<p>condemned to perpetual servitude ? I deny it ; I
</p>
<p>call upon you all to deny it with me ; give me your
</p>
<p>universal promise that Ireland shall he a nation."
</p>
<p>This was addressed to one hundred and fifty thou-
</p>
<p>sand persons ! " Give me your universal promise,
</p>
<p>that Ireland shall be a nation." Cries of " we do,
</p>
<p>we do." " Yes," says Mr. O'Connell, " we shall be
</p>
<p>a nation." He afterwards said, in another part of
</p>
<p>his address : 
</p>
<p>" If I want you again, would you not be ready at
</p>
<p>my word? Let every man who is determined to
</p>
<p>meet me again, on any future occasion, where I
</p>
<p>would require his presence for peaceable purposes,
</p>
<p>hold up his hand."
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, it is by no means unimportant,
</p>
<p>in meetings of this kind, to inquire what has been
</p>
<p>the effect produced upon those who heard the inflam-
</p>
<p>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>137
</p>
<p>refpeat, that a preservative association should be
</p>
<p>formed to preserve every thing that is worth pre-
</p>
<p>servinjj, and to obliterate every thing that ought to
</p>
<p>be obliterated. I trust, that before Christmas comes,
</p>
<p>we will have that association sitting in Dublin, and
</p>
<p>drawing up bills which they will call on tlie British
</p>
<p>parliament to approve of; and if they refuse to do
</p>
<p>so, then respectfully calling on her Majesty to sum-
</p>
<p>mon her parliament together in Ireland again."
</p>
<p>Thus the preservative society was to draw up such
</p>
<p>bills as they might think proper, and call on the
</p>
<p>British parliament to pass those bills ; and if the
</p>
<p>British parliament did not think it right to obey
</p>
<p>the dictation of the preservative society, then her
</p>
<p>Majesty was to be called on to summon a parliament
</p>
<p>in this country, and then Mr. O'Connell would hand
</p>
<p>over to her Majesty the sceptre of this country,
</p>
<p>upon such terms as he should dictate. He further
</p>
<p>said : 
</p>
<p>" I repeat, the practical details of my plan are
</p>
<p>not yet worked out ; but I wish to announce this
</p>
<p>general outline of it, that it may bo fomenting in
</p>
<p>the Irish mind, and be digested by others as well as
</p>
<p>by myself; and I trust that before I have another
</p>
<p>birthday I shall see Ireland righted, and her parlia-
</p>
<p>ment in College-green again."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I think it will not be necessary for
</p>
<p>me to advert to anything that occurred between the
</p>
<p>Gth and the 12th of August. As I stated yesterday,
</p>
<p>I have abstained a good deal from commenting upon
</p>
<p>the general state of organization throughout the
</p>
<p>country, and the object of these multitudinous meet-
</p>
<p>ings, because it is clearly pointed out in a publica-
</p>
<p>tion of one of the defendants. I shall now beg to

</p>
<p>call your attention to that pxiblication, which ap-
</p>
<p>peared in the Nation of the 12th of August, six days
</p>
<p>after the meeting at Baltinglass ; and I think you
</p>
<p>win find it of importance, as throwing light upon
</p>
<p>the objects of those concerned and engaged in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy charged against the defendants. It is
</p>
<p>headed  " The march of Nationality."
</p>
<p>" How beautiful our country is ! How full of
</p>
<p>cautious energy ! How sure a hope lies under her
</p>
<p>anxiety ! How fiercely she springs upon what it is
</p>
<p>right to strike 1 How temperately she avoids all
</p>
<p>needless by-battles ! And 'tis beautiful  lovely,
</p>
<p>with that piercing beauty that pains the heart wliich
</p>
<p>worships  to see her calming down, and soothing,
</p>
<p>and repressing her hungry and bruized children,
</p>
<p>while she prepares for them retribution and relief.
</p>
<p>Her brow is pale  most pale : and well that careful
</p>
<p>mien becomes her. Oh ! 'tis well to see her prepar-
</p>
<p>ing for the strife without rude boasting or hot
</p>
<p>noise. It becomes the heiress of suffering centu-
</p>
<p>ries. Tliere is nothing recorded in history like this
</p>
<p>display. The numbers of these meetings were un-
</p>
<p>equalled in any population. The time, and labour,
</p>
<p>and loss suffered by the people in their long marclies
</p>
<p>to them  were never before voluntarily borne, save
</p>
<p>in the excitement of war. But the order observed
</p>
<p>in coming and going  the organization necessary
</p>
<p>to produce such order  the serious, good temper 
</p>
<p>the absence of riot or vice  made each of these meet-
</p>
<p>ings a strange and formidable event."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this is not my language  it is the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of one of the accused parties  " the absence
</p>
<p>of riot or vice made each of these meetings a strange
</p>
<p>and formidable event." Gentlemen, it is true that
</p>
<p>]38
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray were present.
</p>
<p>The locality of Tara was selected for the meeting
</p>
<p>upon two grounds ; first, it was the place where the
</p>
<p>monarchs of Ireland had been elected, and secondly,
</p>
<p>it was the scene of a battle in the rebellion of 1798,
</p>
<p>where those who were engaged in the rebellion were
</p>
<p>defeated. The highest calculation that was made
</p>
<p>of the numbers at that meeting was a million ; the
</p>
<p>lowest calculation was upwards of a hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand. There is of course a great difference between
</p>
<p>the numbers, but a meeting of a hundred thousand
</p>
<p>men is a formidable event. Gentlemen, that spot
</p>
<p>was selected because it was the place where the
</p>
<p>monarchs of Ireland had been elected, and also, in
</p>
<p>order to excite the minds of the people, it having
</p>
<p>been the scene of a defeat of those engaged in the
</p>
<p>rebellion of 1798. Hundreds of the persons as-
</p>
<p>sembled at Tara were seen upon their knees, pluck-
</p>
<p>ing a wild plant  a geranium with a red leaf  under
</p>
<p>the impression that the colour of the leaf arose from
</p>
<p>the circimistance of the slaughter which took place
</p>
<p>there in the rebellion ; and these particular scenes
</p>
<p>are selected for these meetings, as j'ou will find here-
</p>
<p>after, in order to exasperate the people of this coun-
</p>
<p>try by endeavouring to recal to their minds events
</p>
<p>connected with the past liistory of Ireland. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, at the meeting at Tara Mr. O'Connell address-
</p>
<p>ed the multitude ; he said, amongst other matters: 
</p>
<p>" Yes, the overwhelming majesty of your multi-
</p>
<p>tude will be taken to England, and will have its ef-
</p>
<p>fect there. The Duke of Wellington began by
</p>
<p>threatening us. He talked of civil war, but he does
</p>
<p>not say a single word about that now. He is now

<p>only think of an old general doing such a thing 
</p>
<p>just as if we were going to break our heads against
</p>
<p>stone walls. But the Duke of Wellington is now
</p>
<p>talking of attacking us, and I am glad of it. But I
</p>
<p>tell him this  I mean no disrespect to the brave, the
</p>
<p>gallant, and the good-conducted soldiers that com-
</p>
<p>pose the Queen's army  and all of them that we have
</p>
<p>in this country are exceedingly weU conducted 
</p>
<p>there is not one of you that has a single complaint
</p>
<p>to make against any of them  they are the bravest
</p>
<p>army in the world, and therefore I do not mean to
</p>
<p>disparage them at all  ^but I feel it to be a fact that
</p>
<p>Ireland, roused as she is at the present moment,
</p>
<p>would, if they made war upon us, furnish women
</p>
<p>enough to beat the entire of the Queen's forces.
</p>
<p>Oil ! English honour will never again betray our
</p>
<p>land, for the man would deserve to be betrayed who
</p>
<p>would confide again in England. I would as soon
</p>
<p>confide in the cousin-german of a certain personage
</p>
<p>having two horns and a hoof. At that last battle
</p>
<p>the Irish soldiers, after three days' fighting, being
</p>
<p>attacked by fresh troops, faltered and gave way, and
</p>
<p>one thousand five hundred of the British army en-
</p>
<p>tered the breach. The Irish soldiers were fainting
</p>
<p>and retiring, when the women of Limerick threw
</p>
<p>themselves between the contending forces, and actu-
</p>
<p>ally stayed the progress of the advancing army."
</p>
<p>In another part of his address he said : 
</p>
<p>" See how we have accumulated the people of Ire-
</p>
<p>land for this repeal year. When on the 2d of Janu-
</p>
<p>ary I ventured to call it the repeal year, every person
</p>
<p>laughed at me. Are they laughing now ? It is our
</p>
<p>turn to laugh at present. Before twelve months
</p>
<p>more the parliament will be in College-green. I said

<p>country were relieved from Saxou tyranny and oli-
</p>
<p>garchic dominion. I believe I would best evince the
</p>
<p>high sense I entertain of the compliment paid the
</p>
<p>' press-gang,' by being brief, and allowing them to
</p>
<p>gang home, that they may send their broad sheets
</p>
<p>through the length and breadth of the land, and not
</p>
<p>of that land only, but to the alien isle hard by, that
</p>
<p>so jealously watched the proceedings of that day.
</p>
<p>Every eye was fixed upon the council that day at
</p>
<p>Tara, and eagerly looked to its resolves. "Was it not
</p>
<p>a national council, in the most extended meaning of
</p>
<p>the phrase ? Had they not at their head the mo-
</p>
<p>narch of the Irish heart ? Had they not the spi-
</p>
<p>ritual peers of the realm ? Did not, the lay peers
</p>
<p>aid by their counsel? They had there, too, the
</p>
<p>clergy of the laud, and the constitutional represen-
</p>
<p>tatives of the people. Ay, and the people them-
</p>
<p>selves, in their multitudinous thousands, had that
</p>
<p>day assembled, and within the precincts of the an-
</p>
<p>cient council hall of Tara, taken counsel together,
</p>
<p>and issued their proclamation, and that proclamation
</p>
<p>was No compromise. As I this day strayed over
</p>
<p>the ruins of our past glory, I chanced to walk over
</p>
<p>the graves of the patriots of what I might call their
</p>
<p>own day."
</p>
<p>That is, the graves of those who fell in the battle
</p>
<p>which took place at Tara in 1798.
</p>
<p>" I could not find Tyords to give expression to the
</p>
<p>emotions I felt as I contemplated their sad fate. A
</p>
<p>sorrowful chill came upon me when I looked upon
</p>
<p>their resting-place, and saw in their end the dark
</p>
<p>history of the past. But that chill passed away and
</p>
<p>hope revived, when I saw that upon their graves the
</p>
<p>stone of destiny stood erect. For centuries had that

<p>mysterious relic been prostrate, as the land whose
</p>
<p>destiny its fall symbolised ; but now that I see it
</p>
<p>erect again, and on Tara's hill, and over the patriots'
</p>
<p>grave, 1 feel that the blood of the last martyr has
</p>
<p>been shed, and that Ireland herself would soon as-
</p>
<p>sume the upright position, and exhibit the dignity
</p>
<p>of a nation."
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell addressed the persons assembled at
</p>
<p>the dinner, and he said : 
</p>
<p>" But he is no statesman who does not recollect
</p>
<p>the might that slumbers in a peasant's arm ; and
</p>
<p>when you multiply that might by vulgar arithmetic
</p>
<p>to the extent of 600,000 or 700,000, is the man a
</p>
<p>statesman or driveller, who expects that might will
</p>
<p>always slumber amidst grievances continued and op-
</p>
<p>pression endured too long, and the determination to
</p>
<p>allow them to cm'e themselves, and not take active
</p>
<p>measures to prevent the outbreak which sooner or
</p>
<p>later will be the consequence of the present afflicted
</p>
<p>state of Ireland ? I say sooner or later, because I
</p>
<p>venture to assert while I live myself that outbreak
</p>
<p>will not take place."
</p>
<p>In another part he says : 
</p>
<p>" I now turn to the gentry of Ireland. Let them
</p>
<p>first answer the question I have already put to them
</p>
<p> is it possible things can remain as they are ? It
</p>
<p>is impossible. Why then do they not join us ? Is it
</p>
<p>not their interest to join us ? Wliat are they afraid
</p>
<p>of ? It cannot be of the people, for they are under
</p>
<p>the strictest discipline. I am even one of them my-
</p>
<p>self, and no general ever had an army more submis-
</p>
<p>sive to his commands than the people of Ireland are
</p>
<p>to the wishes of a single individual."
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, I think that submission to the
</p>
<p>140
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>You are in a position to judge of what is meant
</p>
<p>by this committee " by all legal, peaceable, and con-
</p>
<p>stitutional means." The plan then proceeds to de-
</p>
<p>tail the number of representatives which each county
</p>
<p>and town is to return ; and a schedule is annexed to
</p>
<p>that statement, stating the number of representa-
</p>
<p>tives, and the population of each county and town ;
</p>
<p>and then the plan, after providing that the right of
</p>
<p>voting should be what is called household suffrage
</p>
<p>and vote by ballot, and that the Monarch or Regent,
</p>
<p>de facto or de jure in England, should be Monarch or
</p>
<p>Regent in Ireland, and that tlie connexion between
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Ireland, by means of the power
</p>
<p>and authority of the crown should be perpetual,
</p>
<p>concludes thus, " That the foregoing plan be carried
</p>
<p>into effect according to recognized law and strict
</p>
<p>constitutional principle." The recognized law being,
</p>
<p>that the crown was to dispense with the provisions
</p>
<p>of an act of parliament, and that the crown might,
</p>
<p>by virtue of its prerogative, direct the keeper of the
</p>
<p>great seal of Ireland to issue writs for summoning
</p>
<p>an Irish parliament, and exercise the power of dis-
</p>
<p>pensing with the provisions of an act of tlie legislature.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you are not to assume that a plan is to
</p>
<p>be carried into effect by strict constitutional princi-
</p>
<p>ples, because it is asserted that such is the intention.
</p>
<p>You are to attend to the decl.arations of the par-
</p>
<p>ties themselves; and I tell you again, subject to
</p>
<p>the correction of the court, that the crown does
</p>
<p>not possess the power, since the act of union, of
</p>
<p>issuing writs for the summoning of the Irish parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. Gentlemen, on the 23d of August a meeting
</p>
<p>took place at the association, at which were present

</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Doctor Gray. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, you recollect the language of the publication in
</p>
<p>the Nation of the 12th of August which I have read
</p>
<p>to you, that " Ireland was changing into a nation ;
</p>
<p>that she is obtaining all the machinery of one pub-
</p>
<p>lic opinion, order, taxation, justice, legislation." The
</p>
<p>statement that Ireland was obtaining, as part of the
</p>
<p>machinery of a nation, " justice," had reference to
</p>
<p>the arbitration courts ; and I shall now state to you
</p>
<p>an address of Dr. Gray at that meeting, submitting
</p>
<p>the plan for these arbitration courts which the repeal
</p>
<p>association are establishing throughout the country,
</p>
<p>because the crown exercised its prerogative of de-
</p>
<p>priving of the commission of the peace magistrates
</p>
<p>who thought fit to attend these multitudinous
</p>
<p>meetings. Dr. Gray said 
</p>
<p>" I do not intend to trespass on the time of the
</p>
<p>association by making any comments on the report
</p>
<p>I am about to present; I cannot, however, omit
</p>
<p>remarking, that the circumstance the Liberator has
</p>
<p>just referred to, must convince every man who has
</p>
<p>heard it, that the time was come when the ap-
</p>
<p>pointment by the people of judges for the adjust-
</p>
<p>ment of their disputes was not premature. Men
</p>
<p>who, on principle, yielded obedience to those in
</p>
<p>authority in whom they could not confide, would
</p>
<p>never refuse to comply with the fair and impartial
</p>
<p>decision of judges in whom they fully trusted,
</p>
<p>whom they themselves had elected, and whose ap-
</p>
<p>pointment had received the sanction of this asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. The only other observation wth which I
</p>
<p>will preface the reading of the report, has reference
</p>
<p>to the labours of the committee. The committee
</p>
<p>felt that as the government was actively engaged in
</p>
<p>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>141
</p>
<p>glorious triumph  ^tlie criminal abandonment of op-
</p>
<p>portunity is equally certain to be avenged in the per-
</p>
<p>petuation of misrule. Shall the nations who have
</p>
<p>given up their admiration, and sympthy, and trust,
</p>
<p>mock at us for braggarts?  our children's children
</p>
<p>curse our memories as they spit on our dishonoured
</p>
<p>clay ? The world looks on our country for an exam-
</p>
<p>ple. Ireland must become a nation now, or continue
</p>
<p>a province for ever. AVe purposely postpone critical
</p>
<p>details of the plan submitted under the sanction of
</p>
<p>O'Connell's name, and with the authority of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation  contenting ourselves to admire, and in-
</p>
<p>viting our countrymen to admire with us  the sym-
</p>
<p>metry of the temple of freedom raised for their
</p>
<p>reception. The chosen trustees of the people's mo-
</p>
<p>ney now will have the first claim upon their votes
</p>
<p>hereafter. Much inconvenience will be prevented
</p>
<p>by limiting the number strictly according to the sche-
</p>
<p>dule submitted to the nation in the plan of the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation. Constituencies  as tliey will be  districts
</p>
<p>as they are  having greater enthusiasm in the cause,
</p>
<p>or enabled to contribute more liberally to the quali-
</p>
<p>fying fund than others, can transfer to the less for-
</p>
<p>tunate locaUties their surplus of ability and pecu-
</p>
<p>niary weight with advantage and honour to both
</p>
<p>parties."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, on the 4th of September, a meeting
</p>
<p>took place at the Repeal Association ; there were
</p>
<p>present Mr. O'Connell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Kay, Mr. Steele, and Dr. Gray. Subscriptions
</p>
<p>from abroad were acknowledged ; 507. from Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, from Judge Doran ; from Boston 5Sl. ; from
</p>
<p>Albany, New York, 22/. ; from Bangor, one hundred
</p>
<p>dollars. These subscriptions liaving been acknow-

</p>
<p>ledged, and Mr. O'Connell having read the letter
</p>
<p>from Bangor, enclosing one hundred dollars, he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to address the association, and amongst
</p>
<p>other matters he stated  " The meeting at Clontarf
</p>
<p>will take place on the 8th of October. The chair
</p>
<p>will be taken on the mound raised to cover the
</p>
<p>bodies of the Danes who fell in battle there. I have
</p>
<p>received more letters from persons desirous of join-
</p>
<p>ing and taking an active part in tlie repeal cause
</p>
<p>within the last week, than for a considerable period
</p>
<p>before." I have taken the meeting of the 4th of
</p>
<p>September a little out of its course. I forgot to
</p>
<p>mention to you, that on the 24th of August, upon
</p>
<p>the prorogation of parliament, her Majesty made a
</p>
<p>speech from the throne, which alluded, amongst
</p>
<p>other matters, to the existing state of agitation in
</p>
<p>Ireland ; and it was with reference to that speech
</p>
<p>that the observations were made by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>at the meeting, to which I called j our attention
</p>
<p>just now. It will however be more convenient that
</p>
<p>I should go back to the month of August before I
</p>
<p>advert again to the proceedings at the meeting of
</p>
<p>the 4th of September. Her Majesty, in the speech
</p>
<p>from the throne, stated, amongst other matters 
</p>
<p>" I have observed with the deepest concern, the per-
</p>
<p>severing efforts which are made to stir up discon-
</p>
<p>tent and disaffection among my subjects in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and to excite them to demand a repeal of the Le-
</p>
<p>gislative Union. It has been, and ever will be, my
</p>
<p>earnest desire to administer the government of that
</p>
<p>country in a spirit of strict justice and impartiality,
</p>
<p>and to co-operate with parliament in effecting such
</p>
<p>amendments of existing laws as may tend to im-
</p>
<p>prove the social condition, and to develope the na-
</p>
<p>142
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>by drawing a parallel between the course adopted
</p>
<p>towards them, and towards non-commissioned offi-
</p>
<p>cers in foreign countries. Gentlemen, there was still
</p>
<p>nothing new in this. It was taken, as many of the
</p>
<p>proceedings I hare already stated to you were
</p>
<p>taken, from the precedent of 1798. In the Re-
</p>
<p>port of the Secret Committee of the house of com-
</p>
<p>mons in the year 1798, to which I referred before, it
</p>
<p>was reported by the committee  " So early as the
</p>
<p>year 1792 the seduction of the soldiery made a part
</p>
<p>of the system. Printed papers were Industriously
</p>
<p>circulated amongst the privates and non-commis-
</p>
<p>sioned officers." " When our cause progresses," as
</p>
<p>you heard from Mr. O'Connell at Baltinglass, "this
</p>
<p>ground of discontent and dissatisfaction amongst
</p>
<p>the sergeants will be removed." Now, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>keeping in recollection this, which was a part and
</p>
<p>branch of this conspiracy, I beg your attention to a
</p>
<p>letter published in the Pilot newspaper of the 28th
</p>
<p>of August. It is entitled " The Duty of a Soldier."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the letter is long, and I shall read a
</p>
<p>portion of it only ; the whole of it will be read when
</p>
<p>the document is given in evidence : 
</p>
<p>" There are at this instant more men in Ireland 
</p>
<p>three miUions of as brave men as ever trod the
</p>
<p>grass, united as one (.' a sufficient number to con-
</p>
<p>quer Europe') ready at a signal, and determined to
</p>
<p>die, or have full and ample justice  and yet I don't
</p>
<p>fear to assert it, there is not one man amongst them
</p>
<p>who hopes to obtain one sbilUng's worth of any
</p>
<p>man's property. Their animating principle is jus-
</p>
<p>tice  ^peace if possible  but, peace or war, justice.
</p>
<p>There is one class of persons whom Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>has not taken into his school in his lectures upon

</p>
<p>political rights and duties, but who have, it seems,
</p>
<p>profited, notwithstanding, to some extent, of his
</p>
<p>peaceful doctrines  I mean the military. If he
</p>
<p>touched upon this subject he would be cried up at
</p>
<p>once as an open rebel. It would be said that he
</p>
<p>wanted to corrupt the soldiery, and withdraw them
</p>
<p>from their duty. It would be put down as an act
</p>
<p>of high treason. It was, therefore, consummate
</p>
<p>wisdom on his part never even to have alluded to it."
</p>
<p>This letter is signed " Richard Power, P. P., Kil-
</p>
<p>rosenty."
</p>
<p>" I call upon my fellow clergymen  whose duty
</p>
<p>it is to be accurately informed on it, and to commu-
</p>
<p>nicate  that information to all whom it may con-
</p>
<p>cern to set me and the pubUc right when I may
</p>
<p>have erred. I am sm-e many of them will be found
</p>
<p>to do so if I go wrong. A soldier is a person who
</p>
<p>hires himself to a government for the purpose of
</p>
<p>slaying his feUow-men. He does not carry destruc-
</p>
<p>tive weapons for hunting downa wild beasts, or
</p>
<p>butchering sheep or oxen. No ; expressly and dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly, it is to kill his own fellow-creatures 
</p>
<p>Viewed solely in this light, every feeling of our na-
</p>
<p>ture recoils with horror from the profession of a
</p>
<p>soldier, and yet the true soldier is a manly, generous
</p>
<p>and noble fellow. He would sooner stand to be shot
</p>
<p>at than be converted into a murdering man-butcher
</p>
<p>by any such horrible miscreant."
</p>
<p>After some further observations, the letter thus
</p>
<p>proceeds : 
</p>
<p>" Having said this much upon what is not, I now
</p>
<p>come to state what is the duty of a soldier. It is
</p>
<p>his duty to fight against the enemies of his country,
</p>
<p>armed for attack, or armed and forewarned for de-

</p>
<p>ground, to give up the use of all exciseable article? 
</p>
<p>that is the legal, the constitutional mode, by -wliich
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell tells the association, that they are
</p>
<p>to revire the Irish parliament. Gentlemen, in the
</p>
<p>Report of the Committee of Secrecy, there is an allu-
</p>
<p>sion to the Tery same plan in the year 1 797, of giving
</p>
<p>up the use of all exciseable articles for the purpose
</p>
<p>of emban-assing the government, and bringing about
</p>
<p>the objects of the conspirators of that day ; and it
</p>
<p>appears as if they had been studying the liistory of
</p>
<p>the Irish rebellion , and endeavouring, so far as pos-
</p>
<p>sible, to adopt all those principles, and those acts,
</p>
<p>which led to the " premature" outbreak of the
</p>
<p>patriots, as they are called, of that day. " The har-
</p>
<p>vest is now cut  " He proceeds : " I speak the day
</p>
<p>after the fair  " He began to think he had gone
</p>
<p>rather too far. " The resolution for non-consump-
</p>
<p>tion is not proposed at present ; but I am far from
</p>
<p>saying that it may not be proposed, and I will shrink
</p>
<p>from nothing." Mr. O'Connell further said  " We
</p>
<p>have at present in preparation two separate and dis-
</p>
<p>tinct plans. The first is, to arrange the constituency
</p>
<p>in such a manner, that if the Queen be pleased in six
</p>
<p>weeks to issue writs calling a new parliament in
</p>
<p>Ireland, she might be able at once to direct them
</p>
<p>to the proper constituencies. I wish to work out
</p>
<p>this plan in all its details, before I form the council
</p>
<p>of three hundred."
</p>
<p>The council here alluded to was the intended con-
</p>
<p>vention of three hundred persons from the several
</p>
<p>places which were to be represented in the Irish par-
</p>
<p>liament. To get rid of the character of delegates,
</p>
<p>and with a view to escape the provisions of the con-
</p>
<p>vention act, the qualification for each member of the

</p>
<p>society was to be the payment of 100/. ; and Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell was accidentally to ask those three hun-
</p>
<p>dred persons to meet him  as if it were possible, by
</p>
<p>any such contrivance, to deprive such an assemblage
</p>
<p>of its true character. It is impossible to say to what
</p>
<p>lengths the parties might have gone if the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings had not been checked. I have now, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>to call your attention to another publication in the
</p>
<p>Pilot. The former purported to be a letter from the
</p>
<p>Reverend Mr. Power ; this deals with a letter upon
</p>
<p>the subject of the army, but it is not a letter simply
</p>

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>This is tbe inauner in wliich the Queen's speech
</p>
<p>was spoken of by Mr. O'Connell : " It was an un-
</p>
<p>fair advantage that Judy took of us." In a further
</p>
<p>part of his address at that dinner, he said :  " Wlien
</p>
<p>they talked of beating us we were ready with our
</p>
<p>shillelaghs. If they will give us fair play here at
</p>
<p>scolding, I am ready for them. The meeting of
</p>
<p>to-day was one of the most magnificent and nu-
</p>
<p>merous that I have seen. My heart throbbed with
</p>
<p>delight, and I every now and then exclaimed to
</p>
<p>myself, this is an answer to the Queen's speech."
</p>
<p>In a further part of his address, BIr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>said :  " I am leading you  pardon the vanity, you
</p>
<p>have made me vain  in the paths of quiet, and the
</p>
<p>practical observance of the maxim, that ' he who
</p>
<p>commits a crime gives strength to the enemy.' That
</p>
<p>maxim has been the hinge of my political life. I
</p>
<p>am arranging to have my parliamentary plan com-
</p>
<p>plete in case of any accident that might arise. Who
</p>
<p>can calculate how soon we may have a parliament ?
</p>
<p>Let England be involved in any awkward predica-
</p>
<p>ment with one state of Europe  let any country
</p>
<p>on the face of the earth attack her, and in twenty-
</p>
<p>four hours we shall have our own parliament. I
</p>
<p>will proceed cautiously and discreetly, with full
</p>
<p>knowledge, and with an eye to the breakers a-head,
</p>
<p>knowing well the shoal water, and steering the bark
</p>
<p>of Irish liberty through every danger, till it reaches
</p>
<p>in safety the port of repeal." Dr. Gray spoke at
</p>
<p>the same dinner in answer to the toast of " the Re-
</p>
<p>peal Press," and said : 
</p>
<p>"He could not but congratulate the men of
</p>
<p>l/oughrea on the glorious demonstration he had that
</p>
<p>day witnessed. As a Connaughtman he felt proud

</p>
<p>of the bold attitude assumed by his countrymen. If,
</p>
<p>liowever, he felt pride in witnessing such a scene,
</p>
<p>how much greater should be the gratification he
</p>
<p>would experience at being enabled to do his duty to
</p>
<p>them and to the country, by sending to the four cor-
</p>
<p>ners of the globe a faithful portrait of that magnifi.
</p>
<p>cent display?"
</p>
<p>In speaking of the numbers who attended that
</p>
<p>meeting Dr. Gray said  " There were numbers
</p>
<p>there was order  there was precision  but, above
</p>
<p>all, determination was stamped on every brow, and
</p>
<p>wasutteredby every voice; and was he to be told that
</p>
<p>such a people were to be driven from their purpose
</p>
<p>by either the seductions or the frowns of a minister,
</p>
<p>whether uttered by himself or put forth as a royal
</p>
<p>speech ? They threatened before ; but when the in-
</p>
<p>dignant people hurled defiance at them, they sneaked
</p>
<p>like cowed rats before them. Afraid again to
</p>
<p>threaten, they have the meanness to thrust an inno-
</p>
<p>cent and beauteous lady as a shield between them-
</p>
<p>selves and the just wrath of an indignant nation,
</p>
<p>and they have forced her to proclaim slavery for the
</p>
<p>people of this land, as if they fancied that such a de-
</p>
<p>vice could affect the great national movement.
</p>
<p>What did the men of Ireland care for the ministerial
</p>
<p>manifesto ? What did the bold peasantry of Con-
</p>
<p>naught care for it ? No ; they would not halt or
</p>
<p>hesitate even because of the personal opposition of
</p>
<p>the Sovereign. When her idiot grandfather opposed
</p>
<p>himself with all the virulence of his vicious nature
</p>
<p>to the emancipation of the Catholics, did the people
</p>
<p>fear to go on ? There was that day given to the
</p>
<p>minister a substantial proof that the men of Con-
</p>
<p>naught, at least, would never lower the standard of

<p>eliall liave her parliament again. Such are the
</p>
<p>words we address to our fellow-subjects all over the
</p>
<p>globe. Signed by order, Daniei. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Chairman of the committee."
</p>
<p>He then moved that the address of the association
</p>
<p>should be printed on a broad sheet, and circulated
</p>
<p>through Ireland, England, and the Colonies ; and
</p>
<p>his motion was carried by unanimous acclamation.
</p>
<p>By that he distinctly states, and the association who
</p>
<p>adopted that report pronounce, that they have no
</p>
<p>hope of redress from parliament  that they suffice
</p>
<p>for themselves  that unless they redress themselves
</p>
<p>they shall get redress from no other quarter ; and
</p>
<p>then, when he speaks of the constitution.al mode by
</p>
<p>which they are to obtain that redress, he omits to
</p>
<p>state what it is ; and I ask you, after having heard
</p>
<p>that document read, can you have any difficulty in
</p>
<p>coming to the conclusion that it was by the means
</p>
<p>stated in the indictment, that the repeal of the union
</p>
<p>was to be obtained ? It is for you to consider what
</p>
<p>were the intentions of those who announce that
</p>
<p>grievances, if they exist, are to be redressed  not
</p>
<p>by the parliament of the country, but by the Irish
</p>
<p>themselves. This address was circulated by means
</p>
<p>of the repeal press. But lest the repeal press might
</p>
<p>not give sufficient circulation to it, it was printed
</p>
<p>on a broad sheet, and distributed through the
</p>
<p>United Kingdom, and I believe through the Colo-
</p>
<p>nies. Gentlemen, the mode in which the Irish were
</p>
<p>to redress themselves, was pointed out perhaps a
</p>
<p>little more unequivocally at the next meeting which
</p>
<p>was held, because, as the conspiracy gained strength,
</p>
<p>the mask was removed by degrees ; and, as the his-
</p>
<p>tory of this conspiracy proceeds, we find the pretexts

<p>upon which these meetings were held, and the ob-
</p>
<p>jects of them, almost cease to be concealed. The
</p>
<p>next meeting, which was one promised at an associa-
</p>
<p>tion meeting by Mr. O'Connell, took place at Clif-
</p>
<p>den, in the county of Galway, on the 17th of
</p>
<p>September, four days after that meeting of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation, at which the association declared, by ac-
</p>
<p>clamation, that they must redress themselves, and
</p>
<p>that they had no hope from the parUament of the
</p>
<p>United Empire. Dr. Gray, who is one of the pro-
</p>
<p>prietors of the Freeman's Journal, was present at that
</p>
<p>meeting. In the account given in the Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal, the horsemen who attended the meeting are
</p>
<p>described as " troops of peasant cavalry." It is
</p>
<p>stated that a large number of the horsemen wore re-
</p>
<p>peal cards in their hats, bound on with green rib-
</p>
<p>bons ; and that the cavalry was commanded by
</p>
<p>farmers, who carried members' cards. Bauds at-
</p>
<p>tended that meeting, as at former meetings  they
</p>
<p>were part of the pomp and circumstance attending
</p>
<p>them, and as Mr. Duffy thinks, were not unim-
</p>
<p>portant ingredients. Tliis "monster meeting" took
</p>
<p>place withm a few days after the meeting of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation, at which Mr. O'Connell, as chairman of
</p>
<p>the committee, pronounced, and the association pro-
</p>
<p>nounced, that the Irish people were to redress them-
</p>
<p>selves. Mr. O'Connell said : 
</p>
<p>" I had no doubt at all that the women of Conne-
</p>
<p>mara were as handsome and modest-looking as any
</p>
<p>in the world; that opinion has been abundantly
</p>
<p>confirmed by the beauteous scene I have beheld to-
</p>
<p>day. But I came here to make an experiment on
</p>
<p>the men. I want to know whether you are not as
</p>
<p>brave and as Irish as the rest of the nation. I want

</p>
<p>for the settlement of disputes disposed of at petty
</p>
<p>sessions, but actually to have ejectments, and all
</p>
<p>other cases connected with the administration of
</p>
<p>justice, decided by these arbitration courts ; and
</p>
<p>well might Mr. Dufiy in the publication of the 12th
</p>
<p>of August say, they had all the incidents to a na-
</p>
<p>tion  "they had taxation, they had justice, and they
</p>
<p>had legislation." They had not as yet legislation.
</p>
<p>But they had taxation, and justice, and organiza-
</p>
<p>tion. They were acquiringpower inconsistent with
</p>
<p>the security of the country. Gentlemen, there is
</p>
<p>one passage further in the speech of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>St the Clifden dinner, which is the last to which I
</p>
<p>shall call your attention. He said  ' For the pre-
</p>
<p>sent year my monster meetings are nearly over ;
</p>
<p>there will not be above seven or eight more of them ;
</p>
<p>but before I have done with them tlie demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion of moral combination, and of the mighty
</p>
<p>giant power of the people of Ireland, will be
</p>
<p>complete  their discipline will be complete. Why,
</p>
<p>you saw the cavalry fall in at the command of
</p>
<p>Tom Steele ; no aide de-camp of the Lord Lieuten-
</p>
<p>ant was ever more cheerfully obeyed than he was."
</p>
<p>I had omitted, gentlemen, to mention, that there was
</p>
<p>a passage of Mr. O'Connell's address at the meeting
</p>
<p>upon the same subject. At the meeting he stated
</p>
<p>" I have more cavalry than at any former meeting.
</p>
<p>Handy hacks they are too. Dillon Browne spoke of
</p>
<p>the English heavy cavalry following them through
</p>
<p>the mountains ; I believe they would be going away
</p>
<p>from them rather than following them." Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, in the course of about a week afterwards a
</p>
<p>meeting was held at Lismore. At that meeting
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. Barrett were

<p>present; it was on the 24th of September. The
</p>
<p>trades attended with twenty-two banners and flags
</p>
<p>of different descriptions ; there were eleven tem-
</p>
<p>perance bands. The men of Waterford were led
</p>
<p>Dy theRev.JohnSheehan; themenofDungarvanby
</p>
<p>the Eev. Dr. Halley; and the men of Lismore
</p>
<p>by the Rev. Dr. Fogarty ; and the men of other dis-
</p>
<p>tricts also were headed by their clergy. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>at that meeting at Lismore Mr. O'Connell addressed
</p>
<p>the persons assembled, and amongst other observa-
</p>
<p>tions he said  " If you were wanted by me to-mor-
</p>
<p>row, would you not come ? Let as many as would
</p>
<p>come at my call, hold up their hands." Here, it is
</p>
<p>stated in the paper of some of the defendants, "a
</p>
<p>dense forest of uplifted hands waved to and fro
</p>
<p>amid the most tremendous cheering we ever wit-
</p>
<p>nessed ; the scene was actually indescribable." It
</p>
<p>is not very wonderful, that at Baltinglass, in the
</p>
<p>conversation amongst the people, they should have
</p>
<p>had conveyed to their minds, whatever Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's view may have been, that, " the time is nigher
</p>
<p>than you thiuk." He then stated^" Though their
</p>
<p>hands numbered thousands, they had but one heart,
</p>
<p>and that was full of life and strength and hope for
</p>
<p>Ireland." Mr O'Connell further said" He could
</p>
<p>tell them, that the English were beginning to see
</p>
<p>and understand the Irish, and by and by they
</p>
<p>might attempt to bribe them. They might talk of
</p>
<p>compromise ! Compromise to the winds. He would
</p>
<p>have no compromise. He had floated his standard,
</p>
<p>and he would stand by it through weal and woe, and
</p>
<p>on that standard was engraven, Repeal. He was per-
</p>
<p>suaded he had no other way of working out his sal-
</p>
<p>vation than by working out giiod for his fellow-man.

<p>old friends of peaceable agitation. The Liberator
</p>
<p>has said, ' he who commits a crime gives strength to
</p>
<p>the enemy ;' and, we believe, it is quite sufficient
</p>
<p>reason for the Irish not to commit a crime, when
</p>
<p>we tell them that enemy is England. We are pretty
</p>
<p>sure they are not inclined to strengthen her, at any

<p>drill him in the dog-days, withhold his furlough, deprive
</p>
<p>him of his newspaper, confine him for the slightest fault,
</p>
<p>march him to the house of God, armed and uccoutered as
</p>
<p>if for battle ; but leave liim the press open, he has
</p>
<p>BTtLL some hope! But, go farther, deprive him of
</p>
<p>an honest, uncorrupted press, and you drive him to

<p>madness, or perhaps, we should say, revenge I Let
</p>
<p>us just look to the state of the Fifth Fusileers. Our
</p>
<p>readers wiU, no doubt, remember the hapless fate
</p>
<p>of poor M'Manus, who was proved to have dropped
</p>
<p>down dead from over-drilling. Well, what was the
</p>
<p>consequence ? A fine young man, of unimpeachable
</p>
<p>character, an Englishman and a Protestant, named
</p>
<p>George Jubee, stepped out of the ranks and drilled
</p>
<p>a. hole in through the body of the adjutant, one Robert-
</p>
<p>son Mackay, an infamous Scotch tyrant."

</p>
<p>had received a letter, when the regiment was sta-
</p>
<p>tioned at Fermoy, threatening him with ' the
</p>
<p>punishment of death,' and we suppose the maddened
</p>
<p>Jubee would have fusileered the colonel if he had

<p>not wisely left the now dangerous post of over-driller

<p>to the care of Sawney Robertson Mackay. When a

<p>detachment of the Fifth left Loughrea some weeks
</p>
<p>ago, the repealers, with their temperance bands, ac-

<p>companied that detachment for above two miles out
</p>
<p>of town, and, on taking their last sorrowful farewell,
</p>
<p>the soldiers are stated to have taken off their caps

<p>and given three cheers for repeal ! Thus, the
</p>
<p>country appears to have never been so safe, as the
</p>
<p>people and the army are on the best terms !" They

<p>are to " pronounce" as they did in Spain ; that is

<p>the course they are to adopt, and they are to effect

<p>the revolution which this " moral instructor of the

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>quence of the part taken in behalf of Ireland by his .
</p>
<p>brilliant son, eulogizes in his last publication General
</p>
<p>Jackson." That " brilliant son" is, you will re-
</p>
<p>member, the gentleman I mentioned yesterday,
</p>
<p>who, In alluding to Ireland, said, that "the libation
</p>
<p>to a country's freedom must sometimes be quaffed
</p>
<p>in blood." "Jackson was only a lawyer. O'Con-
</p>
<p>is one too ! The former surprised the British by at-
</p>
<p>tacking them twice in the night. So might the
</p>
<p>latter were he driven to it, especially as darkness
</p>
<p>equalises undisciplined and disciplined men, throw-
</p>
<p>ing the advantage, if any, in favour of the former,
</p>
<p>the pike being, from the distinctive peculiarity of
</p>
<p>its shape, the weapon best adapted for night." Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, this publication contains various other obser-
</p>
<p>vations which I shall not trouble you by reading ;
</p>
<p>I think what I have read will be a sufficient justifi-
</p>
<p>cation to me for having called your attention to it.
</p>
<p>I shall not weaken the observations of this "moral
</p>
<p>instructor of the people," who recommends the pike
</p>
<p>as the most useful instrument for that period of the
</p>
<p>twenty-four hours which is wrapt in darkness. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, on the 27th and 28th of September, meet-
</p>
<p>ings of the association took place, and there were
</p>
<p>present on each of these occasions Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Ray, Dr. Gray, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele. On the 27th, I tliink it was that day, the
</p>
<p>form of appointment of arbitrators was submitted
</p>
<p>to the association, and also a form of proclamation
</p>
<p>announcing the institution of a court of arbitration.
</p>
<p>This document is headed by a harp and crown, was
</p>
<p>issued by the association, and is in the form of a
</p>
<p>proclamation. You will not now be much surprised at
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy having said on the 12th of August, that

<p>they had assumed all the forms of a government : 
</p>
<p>" Whereas there has been formed for the district

<p>of , a court of arbitration. Mr , the secre-

<p>forms, and give such information as may be neces-
</p>
<p>sary for the legal commencement of arbitration
</p>
<p>suits.  Signed, by order, T. M. Eav, Secretary."
</p>
<p>This was the system which was not only to super-
</p>
<p>sede, according to Mr. O'Connell, the proceedings of
</p>
<p>the petty sessions' courts, but those of every court
</p>
<p>in Ireland exercising jurisdiction under patent from
</p>
<p>the crown. Gentlemen, I have now arrived at an
</p>
<p>important date in these transactions, the 1st of
</p>
<p>October. It was upon that day that a meeting was
</p>
<p>held on the Rath of MuUaghmast. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>stated at the dinner there, that a million were pre-
</p>
<p>sent in the morning. I believe the lowest calcula-
</p>
<p>tion made of this multitudinous assemblage was
</p>
<p>250,000. Of the defendants there were present Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Ray, and
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray. The Rath of MuUaghmast was selected
</p>
<p>as the place for this multitudinous display of physi-
</p>
<p>cal force, for reasons stated by Mr. O'Connell him-
</p>
<p>self at the meeting.
</p>
<p>"I chose it"  (said Mr. O'Connell  "for an obvi-
</p>
<p>ous reason. We are upon the precise spot in which

</p>
<p>I suppose it will be said that those who selected
</p>
<p>that spot had not combined to excite feelings of hos-
</p>

</p>
<p>jects. But why was this spot selected ? What was

</p>
<p>would shortly see no other police in Ireland." Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell reached the platform at MuUaghuiast
</p>
<p>about two o'clock. It may appear an unimportant
</p>
<p>circumstance, but I tliink you will find it was not
</p>
<p>so, that he came there arrayed in scarlet velvet
</p>
<p>robes.' There are many matters of a very trifling
</p>
<p>nature when stated, which, however slight the effect
</p>
<p>they would have on the higher orders, are calculated
</p>
<p>to have a deep impression on the ignorant people
</p>
<p>assembled in such multitudes. Mr. O'Connell was
</p>
<p>arrayed, gentlemen, in scarlet robes ; and an inci-
</p>
<p>dent occurred on the platform, which also might
</p>
<p>strike some as unimportant, but had a most power-
</p>
<p>ful effect upon the congregated multitudes of that
</p>
<p>day. A cap  which, according to the statement of
</p>
<p>the defendants in their papers, was embroidered and
</p>
<p>ornamented with gold, after the fashion of an ancient
</p>
<p>Irish crown, (so at least said Mr. Barrett,) which is
</p>
<p>preserved in the College Museum  was presented to
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, and after an address read to lum,
</p>
<p>was, with an appearance' of ceremony, placed upon
</p>
<p>his head. I suppose it will he attempted to attach
</p>
<p>some ridicule to this, but no idea of that kind was
</p>
<p>entertained by the people on that day, nor was such
</p>
<p>the effect intended to be produced, whatever colour-
</p>
<p>ing may now be given to the act the object was to
</p>
<p>create a lively impression on the hundreds of thou-
</p>
<p>sands collected there ; and with that view that orna-
</p>
<p>ment was placed on the head of Mr. O'Connell, " the
</p>
<p>monarch of their affections," amidst the cheering of
</p>
<p>the multitudes. I am satisfied it made a deep im-
</p>
<p>pression on the minds of the uneducated people sur-
</p>
<p>rounding the platform in hundreds of thousands.
</p>

<p>platform could not be heard by the crowd, all that
</p>
<p>was done there could be seen by every human being
</p>
<p>present on that occasion. Gentlemen, Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell was in the chair, and addressed the meeting.
</p>
<p>I shall call your attention to some portions of his
</p>
<p>address. He said.
</p>
<p>" I accept with the greatest alacrity the high honour
</p>
<p>you have done me in calling me to the chair at this
</p>
<p>maj estic meeting. Ifeelmore honour than ever I did
</p>
<p>in my life, with a single exception, and that related
</p>
<p>to an equally (if possible) majestic meeting at
</p>
<p>Tara ; but I must say, that if a comparison were to
</p>
<p>he instituted between them, it would take a more
</p>
<p>discriminating eye than mine to discover any dif-
</p>
<p>ference. There are the same incalculable numbers,
</p>
<p>there is the same firmness, there is the same distinc-
</p>
<p>tion, the same exhibition of love to old Ireland, and
</p>
<p>the same resolution not to violate the peace, not to
</p>
<p>be guilty of the sUghtest outrage, not to give the
</p>
<p>enemy power by committing a crime ; but peaceably
</p>
<p>and manfully to stand together in the open day to
</p>
<p>protest before many, and in the presence of God,
</p>
<p>against the iniquity of continuing the union." In
</p>
<p>another part he says : 
</p>
<p>" At Tara I protested against the union ; to-day
</p>
<p>I repeat the protest at Mullaghmast. I declare
</p>
<p>solemnly my thorough conviction, as a constitutional
</p>
<p>lawyer, that the union is totaUy void in point of
</p>
<p>principle and constitutional force. I tell you that
</p>
<p>no portion of the empire has the power of trampUng
</p>
<p>on the rights and liberties of the Irish people. The
</p>
<p>Irish parhament was instituted to make laws and
</p>
<p>not legislatures ; it was instituted under the consti-
</p>
<p>tution, and not to annihilate it. Their delegation

<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>have led you thus far in safety  I have swelled the
</p>
<p>multitude of repealers, till they are so far identified
</p>
<p>with the entire population of the soil, or nearly so.
</p>
<p>I have seven-eighths of the population of Ireland
</p>
<p>enrolling themselves as associates. (Cries of 'more
</p>
<p>power to you.') I do not want more power. I have
</p>
<p>power enough. All I ask of you is to allow me to
</p>
<p>use it. I will go on quietly and slowly. I am ar-
</p>
<p>ranging the plan of a new Irish House of Commons.
</p>
<p>It is a theory, but it is a theory that may be realised
</p>
<p>in three weeks. The arbitrators are beginning to
</p>
<p>sit ; the people are submitting their differences to
</p>
<p>men chosen by themselves. You will see by the
</p>
<p>newspapers that Dr. Gray, and my son, and other
</p>
<p>gentlemen, held a petty sessions of their own in the
</p>
<p>room of magistrates who have been unjustly de-
</p>
<p>prived."
</p>
<p>In another part of the address :  " I have but
</p>
<p>one wish for the liberty and prosperity of the people
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Let the English have England, let the
</p>
<p>Scotch have .Scotland, but we must have Ireland for
</p>
<p>the Irish. I won't be content until I see not a single
</p>
<p>man in any office, from the lowest constable to the
</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor, but Irishmen. Tliis is our land,
</p>
<p>and we must have it. We will be obedient to the
</p>
<p>Queen, joined to England by the golden link of the
</p>
<p>crown, but we must have our own parliament, our
</p>
<p>own bench, our own magistrates  and we will make
</p>
<p>some of the shoneens now upon it leave it."
</p>
<p>And then he says :  " If there is any man in fa-
</p>
<p>vour of the union let him say so. ( Cries of ' not one.')
</p>
<p>I never mistook you. Are there any for continuing
</p>
<p>the union ? (Cries of ' no, no.') Is there any body
</p>
<p>for repeal? (Immense cries of 'all, all.') Ohl my

</p>
<p>friends, listen to the man of peace, who will not
</p>
<p>expose you to your enemies. In 1798 there were
</p>
<p>brave men at the head of the people at large ; there
</p>
<p>were some valiant men, but there were many trai-
</p>
<p>tors who left the people exposed to the swords of the
</p>
<p>enemy. On the Curragh of Kildare you confided
</p>
<p>your military power to your relations; they were
</p>
<p>basely betrayed and trampled under foot ; it was ill-
</p>
<p>organized"  that is, the rebellion of 1798  " a pre-
</p>
<p>mature, a foolish, and an absurd insurrection ; but
</p>
<p>you have a leader now who will never allow you to
</p>
<p>be led astray." In another part of his address he
</p>
<p>says :  " Even your enemies admit that the world has
</p>
<p>not produced any man that can e.xceed the Irishman
</p>
<p>in activity and strength. The Scotch philosopher,
</p>
<p>and the French philosopher has confirmed it, that
</p>
<p>number one in the human race is (blessed be hea-
</p>
<p>ven!) the Irish. Have I any teetotallers there ?
</p>
<p>(Cries of 'yes.') Yes, it is teetotalism that is re-
</p>
<p>pealing the union. I could not afibrd to bring you
</p>
<p>together, I would not dare do it, if I had uot tee-
</p>
<p>totallers for my police. (Cries of ' we are all po-
</p>
<p>lice.') To be sure you are, without paying ; and
</p>
<p>you will soon be the only police, by the help of God."
</p>
<p>In another part he says :_" Oh I my friends, it is a
</p>
<p>cotmtry worth fighting for  it is a country worth
</p>
<p>dying for ; but above all, it is a country worth being
</p>
<p>tranquil, determined, submissive, and docile for."
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, at that meeting there was pro-
</p>
<p>posed and carried what is called " The Leinster de-
</p>
<p>claration for repeal." The Mullaghmast meeting
</p>
<p>was, in fact, the provincial meeting for Leinster ;
</p>
<p>and in consequence of that, the resolutions moved
</p>
<p>and adopted there got the name of " The Leinster

</p>
<p>son why this Rath was chosen as the scene of this
</p>
<p>assembly. There was another, " Mullaghraast and
</p>
<p>its martyrs  a voice from the grave." At that din-
</p>
<p>ner Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Joiin O'Connell, Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele, Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray were present,
</p>
<p>six of the defendants. And it is my duty now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, to call your attention to some of the
</p>
<p>speeches spoken at the dinner. Mr. John O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell was in the chair, and as chairman he proposed
</p>
<p>the Queen's health in the following terms :  "I do
</p>
<p>not, because I cannot anticipate that in any phase of
</p>
<p>circumstances the toast I have now to give will be
</p>
<p>received otherwise than well by Irishmen  it is the
</p>
<p>health of the Queen. Whatever may happen, her
</p>
<p>throne in Ireland is secure. When, the other day,
</p>
<p>we distinguished between the vain and babbling
</p>
<p>words that were put into her mouth, we distinguished
</p>
<p>well between the monarch and the ministers, and
</p>
<p>we would make the same distinction as clearly, and
</p>
<p>as well, were bloody deeds and hard blows to be at-
</p>
<p>tempted. Her ministers may fix her throne amidst
</p>
<p>bloody fields, and blazing cities, and slaughtered
</p>
<p>corpses ; let them take care that the ruddiest stream
</p>
<p>flowing might not be their own blood, and the
</p>
<p>brightest and fiercest flame might not be from the
</p>
<p>strongholds from Avhich they now insult the Irish
</p>
<p>people. Whatever they do, whatever they threaten,
</p>
<p>we will go on, and so sure as there is a heaven above
</p>
<p>us we will establish her throne here among a peace-
</p>
<p>ful, a happy , and a contented people. ' The Queen,
</p>
<p>God bless her.' "
</p>
<p>The defendant. Dr. Gray, read a letter signed
</p>
<p>" Thomas Ffrench," one passage of which I shall
</p>
<p>read to you :  " This mighty movement, unprece-

<p>dented in the history of nations, has now assumed a
</p>
<p>magnitude much too immense to admit of retrograde
</p>
<p>and compromise. Some step must .and will be taken.
</p>
<p>Menaces have been tried with signal discomfiture.
</p>
<p>Overtures of peace will doubtless be now experi-
</p>
<p>mented  promises of concihation and pledges as to
</p>
<p>the removal of grievances. Can these be now accep-
</p>
<p>ted ? I answer, Never ! never 1 The hour of delu-
</p>
<p>sion is past. The scene upon which will be collected
</p>
<p>the flower of Lagenian patriotism  the Rath of
</p>
<p>MuUaghmast, the monument of Celtic confiding
</p>
<p>valour, and of Saxon cowardice and treachery, will
</p>
<p>not I am sure be iaefi"ectual in imparting to the vast
</p>
<p>assemby an instructive lesson. Why should Punica
</p>
<p>fida so long usurp the dignity of the adage. Let it
</p>
<p>at once yield to Britannica fides  a more apt and
</p>
<p>pregnant designation. A cursory glance over the
</p>
<p>annals of Ireland is suflScient to demonstrate that
</p>
<p>the history of British connection with this country
</p>
<p>famishes instances of Saxon perfidy, exceeding in
</p>
<p>numbers and magnitude any in the history of Car-
</p>
<p>thage, or even in the history of the world."
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett made a speech, and in the course of
</p>
<p>it said :  " It has been said, that as we visited the
</p>
<p>hill of Tara to recal the virtues and glorious days of
</p>
<p>Irishmen, in order to awaken the sentiments by which
</p>
<p>we may be restored to independence, so we visit the
</p>
<p>Bath of MuUaghmast to-day to recollect the trea-
</p>
<p>chery by which Ireland was betrayed, and to pre-
</p>
<p>vent, as one of these letters said, the credulity
</p>
<p>which would again expose tMs oppressed country to
</p>
<p>Saxon turpitude."
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, in replying to the toast of " The
</p>
<p>rep^ of the union," made some observations, and
</p>

</p>
<p>Btranger ; and above all, we do not want bigoted
</p>
<p>men to serve us or to do our business." Then in
</p>
<p>another part of the address he says  " It is not by
</p>
<p>accident that to-night we are on the Rath of Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast; it was deliberate design, and yet it is
</p>
<p>curious what a spot we are assembled on. In this
</p>
<p>very spot they fell beneath the swords of the Saxon,
</p>
<p>who used them securely and deUghtfuUy in grinding
</p>
<p>their victims to death. Here the Saxon triumphed ;
</p>
<p>here he raised a shout of victory over his unarmed
</p>
<p>prey ; upon this very spot four hundred able men
</p>
<p>perished, who confiding in Saxon promises came to
</p>
<p>a conference of the Queen's subjects, and in the
</p>
<p>merriment of the banquet they were slaughtered.
</p>
<p>There never returned home but one ; their wives
</p>
<p>were widowed, their children were orphans  in
</p>
<p>their homesteads tlie shriek of despair  the father
</p>
<p>and the husband steeped in their own blood. Their
</p>
<p>wives and mothers wept over them in vain. Oh !
</p>
<p>Saxon cruelty ! How it does delight my heart to
</p>
<p>think you dare not attempt such a feat again. Let
</p>
<p>every mother who hears me, only throw her recol-
</p>
<p>lection back to the homes of the mothers on the
</p>
<p>ensuing morning. Only let them imagine for a
</p>
<p>moment, that the father of her children was to be
</p>
<p>brought home on the morrow a bloody corpse. So
</p>
<p>it was with the mothers of these Irish chieftains.
</p>
<p>So it was with their wives. Their husbands left in
</p>
<p>the pride of manhood, in the force of strength ; they
</p>
<p>left capable of defending them against every enemy.
</p>
<p>They were brought home in the inanity of death, inca-
</p>
<p>pable of affording any protection, or giving any other
</p>
<p>sensation but that of grief and interminable sorrow.

<p>cup of bitterness, and the hour of the vengeance of
</p>
<p>God, I much fear, cannot be far from you. At all
</p>
<p>events, suffering Ireland, you will have your days
</p>
<p>of glory, you have suffered much, and you have
</p>
<p>committed no infliction in return. I defy Saxon in-
</p>
<p>genuity and falsehood to show me any treaty the
</p>
<p>Irish violated ; to show me any one compact they
</p>
<p>ever broke ; to show me any one faith they plighted,
</p>
<p>they did not redeem." This was a transaction that
</p>
<p>took place, or was alleged to have taken place in the
</p>
<p>reign of Queen Mary ; and was recalled to the
</p>
<p>memory of the people for the purpose of exciting
</p>
<p>hostility between the Irish and the English subjects
</p>
<p>of our Queen. After the lapse of centuries, history is
</p>
<p>ransacked for the purpose of finding something likely
</p>
<p>to excite hatred and animosity  forgotten, or falsified
</p>
<p>atrocities are depicted in glowing colours, and the
</p>
<p>descendants of the opposing parties of former times
</p>
<p>are newly arrayed against each other. And yet you
</p>
<p>will be told, when the case comes to be stated for
</p>
<p>the defendants, that they, forsooth, are innocent of
</p>
<p>the charge of conspiring to excite hostility between
</p>
<p>her Majesty's subjects in the two countries. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, in another part he speaks of summoning what
</p>
<p>the Times called, "three hundred bog-trotters."
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray also spoke at this dinner; and, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, he was the chairman of the committee, who
</p>
<p>prepared and presented the report to the association
</p>
<p>with respect to the arbitration courts ; in the course
</p>
<p>of his speech he said  " I stand up to return thanks,
</p>
<p>not on behalf of this class, or of that class, but on
</p>
<p>behalf of the judges appointed by the people  for
</p>
<p>the first time the people's judges. Now we have

<p>153
</p>
<p>will be detailed to you by the witnesses who will
</p>
<p>prove this part of the case. In an early part of this
</p>
<p>prosecution  a statement got into circulation that
</p>
<p>this speech in fact never was made by Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>Tou will have an opportunity of judging how far
</p>
<p>that is true. It is somewhat singular, that if never
</p>
<p>made, yet that it is published in the newspapers of
</p>
<p>three of the defendants. They will have an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity, gentlemen, if they now wish to prove how
</p>
<p>that matter is  of examining the reporters for their
</p>
<p>three newspapers, the persons who reported that
</p>
<p>speech for them  whether that speech was made or
</p>
<p>not. There may be, and of course there will be,
</p>
<p>some trifling variation in language, such as must
</p>
<p>necessarily arise where different reporters publish
</p>
<p>an account of the same proceedings, yet you will
</p>
<p>find them substantially to agree. Their case wUl
</p>
<p>be (as I conjecture, from placards and other mat-
</p>
<p>ters which have been circulated,) to question the
</p>
<p>accuracy of the gentleman who attended the Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast dinner ; but if he shall not state the facts
</p>
<p>truly, three of the defendants, they having detailed
</p>
<p>every part of the proceedings from beginning to
</p>
<p>end in their three newspapers, will have the oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of putting their reporters, when they come
</p>
<p>to prove their case, in the witness box  they will
</p>
<p>have the opportunity of getting those reporters to
</p>
<p>state their version of the matters charged, or their
</p>
<p>denial of them, and say that every word published
</p>
<p>by the defendants, in their newspapers, was pure
</p>
<p>invention  that there never was a meeting at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast, there never was a speech made there,
</p>
<p>that all was the imagination of their newspaper re-
</p>
<p>porters. If they attribute error, or mistake, or

<p>corrupt swearing to our witness, they can produce
</p>
<p>their own reporters  and I should as readily take
</p>
<p>their own newspapers, and their own reporters, as
</p>
<p>I should take that note of the speeches which I
</p>
<p>have now before me, furnished by the reporter em-
</p>
<p>ployed by the government ; and, as to criminality,
</p>
<p>these proceedings will be found to be just as crimi-
</p>
<p>nal in the reports in the defendants' newspapers, as
</p>
<p>in that furnished to me. And I ask you to put the
</p>
<p>question to yourselves, when the defendants go into
</p>
<p>their case, and press you to discredit the witness for
</p>
<p>the prosecution, why do they not venture to pro-
</p>
<p>duce their own reporters, why do they keep back
</p>
<p>persons under their own control  persons ready,
</p>
<p>able, and willing to give evidence for them, if the
</p>
<p>evidence they can give be favourable ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>there was another speech made at this meeting,
</p>
<p>which is one of some importance, and to which I
</p>
<p>must pray your attention. It is a speech made by
</p>
<p>the defendant, the Kev. Mr. Tiemey. I may ob-
</p>
<p>serve, with respect to this speech, it being rather
</p>
<p>strong, that it was published very shortly, both in
</p>
<p>the Pilot, and in (I think) the Freeman's Journal ;
</p>
<p>but the Nation has given it at length, not in the
</p>
<p>very words as we shall prove them, but substan-
</p>
<p>tially the same :  " It is an old story,"  (says Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney)  " but it is not the less valuable on that
</p>
<p>account, that a thing once well begun is more than
</p>
<p>half finished. Repeal has had a noble beginning
</p>
<p>this year, and from the glorious progress it is mak-

<p>ing, I ask, why do the countless multitudes who

<p>purse and the chest. That money was thrown into
</p>
<p>a ditch ; and as a matter of history afterwards, it
</p>
<p>was believed that the English who fought had no
</p>
<p>money ; but that was not really the fact, for they
</p>
<p>left it behind, and a man of the name of Logan,
</p>
<p>about fifty-five years afterwards, in making a ditch,
</p>
<p>got about 2,000/. which they left behind. This battle
</p>
<p>was fought in Clontibret He was then in the fifty-
</p>
<p>eighth year of his age, and he was able, in single
</p>
<p>combat, to beat the stoutest man in England. Three
</p>
<p>years afterwards, he fought the great battle of Yel-
</p>
<p>low Ford in the same locality." He then, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, states : 
</p>
<p>" In that battle the Irish and the English lost
</p>
<p>their general the same Sir Henry Bagnall, the
</p>
<p>murderer of MacMahon, was shot dead. All the
</p>
<p>principal officers of the army and two thousand five
</p>
<p>hundred soldiers were slain on the field of battle,
</p>
<p>while the Irish had but two hundred men killed
</p>
<p>and six hundred wounded. Why, it may be asked,
</p>
<p>when the Irish were so successful and fought such
</p>
<p>noble battles, why were they some time afterwards
</p>
<p>so unfortunate ? I answer, English gold and Irish
</p>
<p>perfidy. And let me ask, in return, is there now
</p>
<p>no English gold and Irish perfidy ? Where are all
</p>
<p>the emancipated Catholic nobles ? Where are some
</p>
<p>: , but thanks be to heaven, where indeed,

<p>where are some of our own prelates ? ^VTiere ^re
</p>
<p>the hordes of place-hunters that you have here
</p>
<p>every day about the Castle ? Where are the would-

</p>
<p>in his own little isolated locality ? The liireling
</p>
<p>reptiles ! Let me have O'Connell and we can do
</p>
<p>without them. I have said English gold and Irish
</p>
<p>perfidy : a price of two thousand pieces of gold was
</p>
<p>set upon the head of O'Neill ; deserted and be-
</p>
<p>trayed by many of those who should have sup-
</p>
<p>ported him, he fled into France, and died at Rome
</p>
<p>in the year 1616, 1 think in the seventy-ninth year
</p>
<p>of his age. Oh ! may the errors of the past be the
</p>
<p>warnings of the future. You have seen the great
</p>
<p>O'Neill, the descendant of so many kings  the hero
</p>
<p>of so many fights  the victor of so many battles,
</p>
<p>sacrificing for ever all his earthly possessions and
</p>
<p>hereditary estates for love of glory. He sunk into
</p>
<p>a grave  his ashes are at Rome  they are now in a
</p>
<p>foreign cUrne, almost unknown and forgotten. Oh i
</p>
<p>if they are not unknown and forgotten I hope that
</p>
<p>due honour will be paid yet in Ireland to his name
</p>
<p>and to his virtues. I have said you are always suc-
</p>
<p>cessful when you are united. Now you are united,
</p>
<p>nothing can mar your prospects  nothing can
</p>
<p>blight your success  notliing can prevent you, save
</p>
<p>either your own ^imidity, your own treachery, or
</p>
<p>your own wavering. Are you ready to desert your
</p>
<p>leader and sell your country ? (' Never, never. ') Then
</p>
<p>if you are not, and I know you are not, I shall only
</p>
<p>remark there are two ways that present themselves
</p>
<p>to you ; one brings j'ou to slavery, the other con-
</p>
<p>ducts you to happiness and victory. If you select

<p>the first, by cringing and flattery, and licking the

<p>horsanen on the meeting ground shall keep a pro-
</p>
<p>per distance from the platform, so as not to incom-
</p>
<p>mode those attending on foot ; and it is earnestly
</p>
<p>requested, on the other hand, that no obstruction or
</p>
<p>interruption will be offered to the cavalcade by those
</p>
<p>on foot or in vehicles, so that the order and regula-
</p>
<p>rity of the march may be preserved. God save the
</p>
<p>Queen. Mount for Repeal. March for Clontarf.
</p>
<p>The committee will meet at the Corn Exchange
</p>
<p>each day during the ensuing week from four to five
</p>
<p>o'clock. Dated Com Exchange, 30th September,
</p>
<p>1843."
</p>
<p>Now that advertisement appeared, as I have al-
</p>
<p>ready stated to you, on the 30th of September ; and
</p>
<p>I have told you, that a meeting of the association
</p>
<p>took place upon the 2nd of October, at which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell was present. That was on Monday, the
</p>
<p>day after the Mullaghmast meeting ; and Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell said at that meeting :  " I wish to say,
</p>
<p>I saw with great surprise in some of the newspapers
</p>
<p>on Saturday a paragraph headed ' Kepeal Cavalry
</p>
<p> Clontarf Meeting.' I think it was a very good
</p>
<p>quiz  but it ought not to have been printed." You
</p>
<p>will understand the meaning of that just now
</p>
<p>" And I need not inform the repeal association not
</p>
<p>to pay the least attention to it. We were consider-
</p>
<p>ing it was quite likely that horsemen would be at
</p>
<p>the great meeting at Clontarf; of course every gen-
</p>
<p>tleman, every repealer who has a horse in Dublin is
</p>
<p>likely to ride there. They must observe the most
</p>
<p>perfect order, because if the horsemen mingled with
</p>
<p>the carriages, those on foot might be trampled on."
</p>
<p>Now certainly it was rather an indiscretion to print
</p>
<p>it. They had been talking about it at the commit-

</p>
<p>tee, and it certainly ought not to have been printed ;
</p>
<p>I quite concur in that. And now I will tell you,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, the course that was adopted. Did they
</p>
<p>insert in the papers an advertisement disavowing
</p>
<p>altogether that of the 30th of September ? Was
</p>
<p>that the course adopted ? No : a new advertise-
</p>
<p>ment was pubhshed, not altogether disclaiming and
</p>
<p>omitting this quiz, as it is called, which rather indis-
</p>
<p>creetly was printed, but some one took up a pen
</p>
<p>and turned the word " troops" into " groups,"
</p>
<p>struck out the word " cavalry," the words " oifi-
</p>
<p>cer," " muster," " march," and " parade," and left
</p>
<p>the advertisement word for word as it was before,
</p>
<p>except in the particulars I have mentioned ; and this
</p>
<p>document, this quiz, was just as well understood
</p>
<p>when the amended and disguised advertisement was
</p>
<p>published, as if it had remained in its original form.
</p>
<p>The populace knew that although it was more con-
</p>
<p>venient to call " troops" " groups," yet that it was
</p>
<p>the same thing under a different name. And this
</p>
<p>was what was resorted to after they had " been
</p>
<p>considering" it. On the 3rd of October, the day
</p>
<p>after this quiz is spoken of, the mistake is rectified.
</p>
<p>I will read the advertisement for you now in its
</p>
<p>amended form, and you will understand, when I
</p>
<p>read it, the amendments. " The other" (say they)
</p>
<p>" it was certainly rather indiscreet to print ; all
</p>
<p>these matters should have been arranged quietly
</p>
<p>within doors, without saying anything about it ; the
</p>
<p>indiscretion of some cue on the committee makes it
</p>
<p>necessary to amend the form." But, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the substance of the advertisement, and the sense,
</p>
<p>and meaning of it, with all its illegality, remains as
</p>
<p>palpably on the face of the advertisement as when

<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>quered the Danes at Clontarf, was eighty-eight
</p>
<p>years. This should serre to warn our rulers against
</p>
<p>wantonly attacking O'Connell. Clontarf  they
</p>
<p>should remember Clontarf!" There then follows,
</p>
<p>what I shall not trouble you by reading, a length-
</p>
<p>ened account of the battle of Clontarf. " Thus ter-
</p>
<p>minated the battle of Clontarf. What strikes a per-
</p>
<p>son most on reading the account of it is, the bravery
</p>
<p>that the Dal-Cassians, under Brian, displayed in re-
</p>
<p>pelling such a host of invaders from their shores, to
</p>
<p>which they had been welcomed by so many traitors
</p>
<p>among the Leinster Irish." You are aware that the
</p>
<p>Dal-Cassians was the ancient name of the Tippe-
</p>
<p>rary men, of whom you were told, I think it was by
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, that twenty thousand of them would
</p>
<p>form such a good " National Guard for Ireland."
</p>
<p>" In those days every petty chieftain was called a
</p>
<p>king, and had, no doubt, his passions and his jea-
</p>
<p>lousies, as well as greater monarchs. Brian, strn
</p>
<p>and vigorous, was a man of such consummate judg-
</p>
<p>ment and bravery, that he awed some, and conci-
</p>
<p>liated others, into submission to his authority. Had
</p>
<p>Ireland been unanimous in his time, or in the subse-
</p>
<p>quent time of Henry II., neither the Danes nor the
</p>
<p>Saxon serfs, headed by the Norman robbers, would
</p>
<p>have dared to set their foot on her shores ; but it was
</p>
<p>the destiny of her children to be always dis-
</p>
<p>united among themselves, and through that means
</p>
<p>they became a prey to the tyrants and plunderers,
</p>
<p>by whom they were attacked. From this it follows
</p>
<p>that they never were so formidable, if wantonly at-
</p>
<p>tacked. All that could be required of them, if they
</p>
<p>were attacked, would be to imitate the conduct of
</p>
<p>their ancestors, the Dal-Cassians, who never en-

<p>tered a iield without being resolved ' to conquer or
</p>
<p>die !' A brief detail of the hardship experienced by
</p>
<p>this noble race, on their return to their own coun-
</p>
<p>try, after the battle of Clontarf^ may be interesting
</p>
<p>to our readers." There is then a statement connected
</p>
<p>with the Dal-Cassians after the battle of Clontarf,
</p>
<p>and then this passage in conclusion :  " May the
</p>
<p>Irish people of the present day, should they be
</p>
<p>driven to it, imitate the brave Tipperary men, or
</p>
<p>former Dal-Cassians." That is a publication upon
</p>
<p>the eve, the Friday previous to that Sunday, upon
</p>
<p>which it was intended to hold this Clontarf meeting.
</p>
<p>This meeting promised to be of a most formidable
</p>
<p>character, keeping in recollection the cii'cumstances
</p>
<p>under which the parties were to be marshalled under
</p>
<p>the directions of the association given in that adver-
</p>
<p>tisement, wliich, however it may have been altered,
</p>
<p>yet were the directions under which the persons
</p>
<p>were to assemble, and proceed to the meeting at
</p>
<p>Clontarf. Gentlemen, on the day after, on Satur-
</p>
<p>day, the 7th of October, there appeared in the
</p>
<p>Nation newspaper, a letter addressed " to the editor
</p>
<p>of the Na(!on," signed " A Dal-Cassian," in which,
</p>
<p>amongst other things, the writer " begged leave to
</p>
<p>offer a suggestion to his countrymen, that for the
</p>
<p>future, after the meeting at Clontarf, on the follow-
</p>
<p>ing day, the Irish should not use any Saxon or Nor-
</p>
<p>man names ; but as they had been changed in ancient
</p>
<p>times at the conquest of Ireland, that they should,
</p>
<p>whenever it was possible, name the different coun-
</p>
<p>ties by their original names, by the adoption of some
</p>
<p>plan by which the true Irish name could be restored."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is unnecessary, of course, that I
</p>
<p>should do more than advert to the meeting on
</p>
<p>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OPENING SPEECH.
</p>
<p>157
</p>
<p>laws passed by the English parliament. That ex-
</p>
<p>planation will be sufficient I think to meet tlie pre-
</p>
<p>cedent of the Irish volunteers which has been sought
</p>
<p>to be relied upon, and I do impeach, as illegal, reso-
</p>
<p>lutions which assert that no power on earth but the
</p>
<p>Queen, lords, and commons of Ireland ought to
</p>
<p>legislate for Ireland. That resolution is against the
</p>
<p>terms of the act of union. It is a resolution that
</p>
<p>ought not to have been adopted at any meeting. I
</p>
<p>have now, gentlemen, at very considerable length,
</p>
<p>I am afraid at too great a length, gone through the
</p>
<p>statement of the several meetings to which I think
</p>
<p>it important that I should call your attention ; and
</p>
<p>I shall now beg leave to remind you of the charge
</p>
<p>upon which the defendants stand indicted. They
</p>
<p>Btand indicted for a combination, conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>confederacy to raise and create discontent and dis-
</p>
<p>affection amongst her Majesty's subjects ; to excite
</p>
<p>them to hatred and contempt of the government and
</p>
<p>constitution of the realm as by law established ; and
</p>
<p>to unlawful and seditious opposition to the govern-
</p>
<p>ment and constitution. And I now ask you, whe-
</p>
<p>ther, after the details I have laid before you, you
</p>
<p>can entertain any doubt of the guilt of the defen-
</p>
<p>dants, if this case be proved ? Gentlemen, it is im-
</p>
<p>possible to carry on the government of the country,
</p>
<p>if the inhabitants of different portions of the empire
</p>
<p>are to be excited to a state of hostility towards each
</p>
<p>other. I am- satisfied that no hostility would have
</p>
<p>existed, if it were not for the course adopted by
</p>
<p>those who have been so mischievously agitating this
</p>
<p>country ; and I think, gentlemen, that you wiU
</p>
<p>concur with me in this feeling. If we establish the
</p>
<p>case which I have stated to you upon this branch of

</p>
<p>the indictment, it is your bounden duty not to hesi-
</p>
<p>tate to convict ; if you are satisfied by the evidence
</p>
<p>which will be detailed before you in proof, you will
</p>
<p>have no difficulty in finding the defendants guilty of
</p>
<p>this portion of the charge. Gentlemen, there is
</p>
<p>another part of the charge which is also of a very
</p>
<p>serious nature, and that is, a conspiracy to excite
</p>
<p>discontent and disaffection in the army. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I think you can very well understand the progress
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy ; it was first necessary to excite
</p>
<p>disaffection amongst the people, and secondly, it
</p>
<p>was necessary, if possible, in order to insure success
</p>
<p>to those engaged in that conspiracy, to excite hos-
</p>
<p>tility towards that portion of the empire with which
</p>
<p>Ireland is united ; and I am sure you must be of
</p>
<p>opinion that the most active measures were adopted
</p>
<p>for the purpose of exciting such hostility. It then
</p>
<p>became important, of course, to show the people their
</p>
<p>strength, to organize them, to accustom them to
</p>
<p>come from distances to fixed places of rendezvous,
</p>
<p>and, having taiight the people their strength, to awe
</p>
<p>the government, if not by outbreak, at least by the
</p>
<p>demonstration of physical force, into granting the
</p>
<p>demands of those who advocate the repeal of the
</p>
<p>union. But, gentlemen, so long as the army re-
</p>
<p>mained faithful to the crown, there would have been
</p>
<p>but little expectation of any success arising from mere
</p>
<p>organization, or from the meetings of crowds of peo-
</p>
<p>ple ; but, proceeding step by step, these parties, in
</p>
<p>their attempt to dismember the empire, considered,
</p>
<p>as in 1797, that it was most important to alienate
</p>
<p>the minds of the army, and to create discontent and
</p>
<p>disaffection among them, and especially among the
</p>
<p>non-commissioned otBcers, whose aid and assistance,

<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>rejoice, as I hare already said, that such was
</p>
<p>the plan adopted, that we have not incurred the
</p>
<p>misery which would have arisen from an opposite
</p>
<p>policy ; but that does not take away from the illega-
</p>
<p>lity of these proceedings, if the intention were, to
</p>
<p>organize the people to that extent that the govern-
</p>
<p>ment of the country could not be carried on inde-
</p>
<p>pendently, but only under the pressure and control
</p>
<p>of assembled multitudes, combined multitudes, whose
</p>
<p>leaders should dictate to the legislature the course it
</p>
<p>must pursue. Such an intention, and a combination
</p>
<p>to bring such an intention into operation, are both
</p>
<p>unlawful. As I have already said, and as was said
</p>
<p>by Mr. Justice Rooke, in one of the cases I referred
</p>
<p>to in the state trials, even although one of the defen-
</p>
<p>dants, or any of the defendants, may not have in-
</p>
<p>tended that a tumult should follow as the consequence
</p>
<p>of this act, yet they are guilty if the consequences
</p>
<p>were the effect of their acts and addresses, as much
</p>
<p>as if they actually intended such consequences to
</p>
<p>follow. Mr. Justice Rooke says, a man might as
</p>
<p>well say he did not intend an injury to a crowd
</p>
<p>among whom he fired a pistol, but he must be pre-
</p>
<p>sumed, and ought to be presumed, to foresee the
</p>
<p>consequences of his acts. Mr. O'Connell may not
</p>
<p>have foreseen the length to which he went at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast, when that " sickly dream" came over him ;
</p>
<p>he appears at that time to have been afraid, that
</p>
<p>the people of Ireland had been wound up to so great
</p>
<p>an extent that an outbreak might take place ; but
</p>
<p>whether he intended it or not, whether he intended
</p>
<p>that each particular meeting should end peaceably,
</p>
<p>and that at no later period should there be any re-
</p>
<p>course to actual physical force, or to anything be-

</p>
<p>yond a demonstration of it, I again tell you con-
</p>
<p>fidently, subject to the court correcting me on the
</p>
<p>subject, that those meetings, and the combination
</p>
<p>and conspiracy to procure them, are equally illegal,
</p>
<p>on the present indictment for conspiring to procure
</p>
<p>alterations in the law otherwise than by constitu-
</p>
<p>tional means. Gentlemen, I may now tell you what
</p>
<p>I have no doubt you will also be told by the court,
</p>
<p>that it is not necessary for the purpose of a verdict
</p>
<p>of guilty, that you should come to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that the defendants were guilty of every portion of
</p>
<p>this conspiracy. It is sufficient that you should be
</p>
<p>of opinion, that they were guilty of any part of it ;
</p>
<p>and on the part of the crown, although I believe we
</p>
<p>shall be able to establish every portion of our charge,
</p>
<p>it is right for me in tliis part of the case to say, that
</p>
<p>that is not absolutely necessary in point of law, that
</p>
<p>we should do so. Now, gentlemen, having detained
</p>
<p>you, and detained the court, at such great length,
</p>
<p>and not indeed being myself very equal to speak
</p>
<p>much longer, I shall conclude the observations
</p>
<p>which I have taken the liberty to submit to you with
</p>
<p>respect to this case, in the language of the same
</p>
<p>pminent judge. Lord Chief Justice Bushe, whom I
</p>
<p>thought it necessary to cite to you in another part
</p>
<p>of this case :  " I will conclude, " says his lordship,
</p>
<p>" by recalling your attention to all that is in our
</p>
<p>power to do, and that is our duty. Let us do that
</p>
<p>fiirmly and temperately  I say firmly and tempe-
</p>
<p>rately, for in agitated times it is hard to preserve
</p>
<p>an equable balance of the mind. Fear is a corrupt-

<p>ing principle, and alarm operates in different and
</p>
<p>opposite directions. In such times the influence of
</p>
<p>panic has led men, I am sorry to say, of all classes,

</p>
<p>Do you remember having come over to this coun-
</p>
<p>try in September last ?
</p>
<p>Witness  Yes, I do.
</p>
<p>On what day did you arrive ?
</p>
<p>Witness On the 29th of September on the 30th,
</p>
<p>I mean.
</p>
<p>On what day of the week ?
</p>
<p>Witness  On Saturday. I never was in Ireland
</p>
<p>before ; I recollect the following day, the 1st of Oc-
</p>
<p>tober ; I went to MuUaghmast on that day ; I think
</p>
<p>I arrived there about half-past twelve o'clock ; there
</p>
<p>were a great many persons assembled about the
</p>
<p>grounds when I got there  a large number; I
</p>
<p>should tliink about thirty or forty thousand persons,
</p>
<p>as near as I can guess ; I could not see over the
</p>
<p>whole extent of the ground ; I saw persons coming
</p>
<p>from different places with banners ; if you will allow
</p>
<p>me to refer to my book I shall tell j'ou the inscrip-
</p>
<p>tions. I took on that occasion a note or memoran-
</p>
<p>dum of what passed ; that is, of the speeches ; I
</p>
<p>have it here ; 1 saw the inscriptions ; " Hurrah for
</p>
<p>the Repeal !" was one of them ; " A nation of nine

<p>platform was an inscription, " The man who com-

</p>
<p>must be a nation," was also one. " A country with

<p>nine millions of inhabitants is too great to be dragged
</p>
<p>at the tail of any nation." There were several per-
</p>
<p>sons in and about the platform, with papers round
</p>
<p>their hats, and staves in their hands ; there was an
</p>
<p>inscription on the papers, " O'Connell's Police ;" I
</p>
<p>know the traverser, Daniel O'Connell ; I see him in
</p>

<p>immediately under the witness's chair, rose and
</p>
<p>bowed to the witness.] Mr. O'Connell arrived at
</p>
<p>the place of meeting about two o'clock ; I am not
</p>
<p>aware that I saw Mr. John O'Connell on that occa-
</p>
<p>sion; there were some of the gentlemen present,
</p>
<p>whose names I learned, Mr. Ray and Dr. Gray ; I
</p>
<p>think I should recollect Mr. Ray. [The witness
</p>
<p>here turned to the traversers' box, in which Mr.
</p>
<p>Ray and Dr. Gray sat, and identified both gentle-
</p>
<p>men.] I know Mr. Thomas Steele ; I saw him at
</p>
<p>that meeting ; I see him now in court  [he pointed
</p>
<p>to him ;] Mr. O'Connell was dressed that day in a
</p>
<p>sort of velvet robe, scarlet or claret colour ; some
</p>
<p>gentleman proposed that Mr. O'Connell should take
</p>
<p>the chair ; that motion was put and carried ; Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell addressed the meeting on his taking the
</p>
<p>chair ; I took notes of what Mr. O'Connell said upon
</p>
<p>that occasion to the best of my ability ; I took my
</p>
<p>notes in short-hand ; I have both the transcript and
</p>
<p>the original notes here [A large parcel which lay
</p>
<p>before the Clerk of the Crown was here opened, and
</p>
<p>several books in pliant " marble binding,' were
</p>
<p>taken out, one of which was handed to the witness.]
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General then desired the witness to
</p>
<p>read to the jury what Mr. O'Connell said, which he
</p>
<p>proceeded to do. When he came to a particular
</p>
<p>passage, the Chief Justice desired him to read it
</p>
<p>over again, which he did as follows :  " I admit that
</p>
<p>the union has the force of law, because it is sup-
</p>
<p>ported by the policeman's truncheon, the soldier's
</p>
<p>bayonet, and the horseman's sword ; but it is not
</p>
<p>supported by constitutional law."

<p>Ireland and liberty (cheers). The repeal arbitra-
</p>
<p>tors are beginning to act  the people are submitting
</p>
<p>their differences to men chosen by themselves. You
</p>
<p>will see by the newspapers that Dr. Gray, and my
</p>
<p>son, and other gentlemen, have already held a petty
</p>
<p>sessions of their own, where justice will be adminis-
</p>
<p>tered free of all expense to the people. The people
</p>
<p>shall have chosen magistrates of their own in the
</p>
<p>room of the magistrates who have been removed.
</p>
<p>The people shall submit their differences to them,
</p>
<p>and shall have strict justice administered to them
</p>
<p>that shall not cost them a single farthing. I shall
</p>
<p>go on with that plan until we have all disputes set-
</p>
<p>tled and decided by justices appointed by the people
</p>
<p>themselves. (' Long may you hve.') I wish to live
</p>
<p>long enough to have perfect justice administered in
</p>
<p>Ireland, and liberty proclaimed throughout the
</p>
<p>land (great cheers). Oh, my glorious countrj^men,
</p>
<p>endowed with every virtue, the contrast between
</p>
<p>you and your oppressors is to me a subject of exul-
</p>
<p>tation and delight. In everything you have proved
</p>
<p>your virtue and generosity  in everything they
</p>
<p>have proved their cruelty and treachery. Who was

<p>it dared to talk of this as a religious question ? 
</p>
<p>When persecution was practised in other countries,
</p>
<p>the Catholics of Ireland never persecuted ; it was
</p>
<p>absurd, therefore, to dream they should do so now,
</p>
<p>when everybody admitted that persecution did not
</p>
<p>make converts. Queen Mary persecuted, and Ca-
</p>
<p>tholicity in England perished. In Ireland there
</p>
<p>was no persecution, and it was triumphant. It was

</p>
<p>sociation, and proposed at an aggregate meeting
</p>
<p>of Catholics by a Carmelite friar, the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>L'Estrange. The grand master of the Orangemen
</p>
<p>of Ireland, Sir Abraham Bradley King, applied to
</p>
<p>me to procure him redress, when his own party for-
</p>
<p>sook him, because they found that they had made a
</p>
<p>had bargain with him, and were ashamed of their
</p>
<p>doings. I examined his papers, and found that he
</p>
<p>had justice on his side ; and though he was the
</p>
<p>grand master of the Orangemen, I scorned to think
</p>
<p>of that (hear, hear) ; or if I did think at all of it, I
</p>
<p>did so to feel a livelier anxiety to obtain justice for
</p>
<p>him, and I succeeded. I got 2,500/. a year for him
</p>
<p>for life, and at the last hour of his existence, I will
</p>
<p>do him the justice to say, he told his son-in-law,
</p>
<p>who was a captain in the army, to find me out, and
</p>
<p>tell me that the grand master of the Orangemen
</p>
<p>had died in comfort, obtained for him through my
</p>
<p>means (loud cheers). I do not state this through
</p>
<p>any vain boasting, but to meet the accusations that
</p>
<p>are brought against is. "
</p>
<p>Examination resumed  I heard resolutions pro-
</p>
<p>posed at that meeting ; the first resolution was pro-
</p>
<p>posed by Mr. Aylmer ; I heard the second resolu-
</p>
<p>tion which was proposed by Mr. Hacket, of Kilkenny,
</p>
<p>and seconded by Alderman Kesh.an; it was as
</p>
<p>follows :  " We, the gentry, clergy, freeholders, and
</p>
<p>other inhabitants of the province of Leinster, here
</p>
<p>assembled, do declare in the face of heaven and our
</p>
<p>country, that no power on earth save the Queen,

<p>lords, and commons of Ireland, can* make laws for

<p>Ireland j" that resolution was put from the chair

<p>and carried.

</p>
<p>of the house of Brunswick that treated this unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate country with justice, and it is afflicting to
</p>
<p>think that her ministry are so base and perfidious,
</p>
<p>60 paltry and selfish, as to endeavour to obtain ad-
</p>
<p>rantages for themselves and their party at the ex-
</p>
<p>pense of the high and chivalrous feeling of exalted
</p>
<p>allegiance which the people of Ireland bore, aye, and

<p>still bear, to their Queen." Witness read till he

<p>came to say, " a proof that each man "

<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon, Q.C That every mau.

<p>Witness  I might have misunderstood him.
</p>
<p>[When the witness came to that portion of the
</p>
<p>speech in which Mi-. O'Connell spoke of the hostiUty
</p>
<p>of the ministers to Ireland, considerable merriment
</p>
<p>was excited in court at the different allusions and
</p>
<p>expressions of the honourable gentleman in reference
</p>
<p>to them. The following passage respecting the
</p>
<p>]Juke of Wellington was received with great laugh-
</p>
<p>ter : " The poor old duke ! what shall I say of hira ?
</p>
<p>To be sure he was born in Ireland, but being born

<p>in a stable does not make a man a. horse."]

<p>and repeal arbitrators."]
</p>
<p>Examination continued  I remember attending a
</p>
<p>meeting at the Corn-Exchange the day after the
</p>
<p>meeting at Mullaghmast ; it was on the '2d of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber ; I got admission there by having stated that I
</p>
<p>intended to report ; on the following day I obtained
</p>
<p>a ticket of admission from Mr. Ray ; the words upon
</p>
<p>the ticket were " Admit the bearer, Mr. Hughes, of
</p>
<p>the press, to all our meetings.  T. M. Ray ;" at the
</p>
<p>time I got that ticket, I said, you had better men-
</p>
<p>tion that I am the reporter for the government ;
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray said, " No, that will be sufficient, it will admit
</p>
<p>you ; the Conciliation Hall will be open soon, and
</p>
<p>we will have a diiferent place then for yourself;" it
</p>
<p>was imderstood at Mullaghmast that I was the go-
</p>
<p>vernment reporter ; at the conclusion of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's opening speech there he stated that he under-
</p>
<p>stood there was a gentleman present on behalf of the
</p>
<p>government ; I then got up and said that I attended
</p>
<p>on behalf of the government to report the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings; Mr. O'Connell then said that on former oc-
</p>
<p>casions, when government reporters had attended,
</p>
<p>he had afforded them every facility, and fm'nished
</p>
<p>them with documents, &c., and that he should be
</p>
<p>happy to afford the same accommodation to me ; I
</p>
<p>believe it was also through Mr. O'Connell that I
</p>
<p>received a ticket for the banquet. [Witness here
</p>
<p>identified Mr. Barrett as one of the peTsons who at-
</p>
<p>tended the meeting at Mullaghmast, on the 2nd
</p>
<p>of October.]
</p>
<p>Did you take notes of what occurred at a meet-
</p>
<p>ing of the association at the Corn Exchange ? I
</p>
<p>waa there at the commencement.

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>On hiB coming: out Tasked him " May Ihave the do-
</p>
<p>cuments, or do you refuse them ?" He replied, "Oh
</p>
<p>no, I do not refuse them ; I do not mean any disre-
</p>
<p>spect to you, but I can't lay my hands on them ;"
</p>
<p>and he further added, " I do not think I should waste
</p>
<p>my time in writing them out for Sir Robert Peel."
</p>
<p>I replied that " I had nothing to do with Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel, and that I was applying to him in my charac-
</p>
<p>ter as a short-hand writer for those documents." He
</p>
<p>then replied, " Oh, you may take them from the news-
</p>
<p>papers ; they areauthentic." On the following day
</p>
<p>I was in the Corn Exchange, and Blr. O'Connell was
</p>
<p>there. I addressed him and told him that Dr. Gray
</p>
<p>had refused to give me copies of the resolutions, but
</p>
<p>told me they were authentic as they appeared in the
</p>
<p>newspapers. Mr. O'Connell replied, " Yes, yes,
</p>
<p>they are authentic." A letter from Loughrea was
</p>
<p>read at the meeting of the association on the 3d of
</p>
<p>October. I got this copy of a letter from Mr. Ray
</p>
<p>it is dated Loughrea, October 2, 1844, and was read
</p>
<p>at the meeting of the association on the 3d of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber. The witness then read the letter. [It was re-
</p>
<p>ferred to and read in the Attorney-General's speech.
</p>
<p>It enclosed 141. as the subscription of 14 of the town
</p>
<p>commissioners, and was signed Patrick Skerrett,
</p>
<p>chairman, Wm. M'Carthy, secretary. It was Mr.

<p>O'Connell read that letter.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  Did Mr. O'Connell make any
</p>
<p>ohserration immediately after readingthe concluding
</p>
<p>passage, " that they were determined to remove
</p>
<p>two or three recusants from the body with all pos
</p>
<p>sible despatch, when the opportunity offered ?"
</p>
<p>, Witness  Yes ; he said they were right to turn
</p>
<p>out those who would not become repealers.

<p>Witness (after again looking at the document) 
</p>
<p>This is a copy, and there is no address on it to any-

<p>body.

<p>[The witness then went on reading Mr. O'Con-

<p>inserted on the minutes, and that the thanks of the

<p>association be conveyed to the writer and the other
</p>
<p>gentlemen named therein.]
</p>
<p>Witness  Mr. Steele was present at that meeting ;
</p>
<p>he addressed the meeting ; he said he rose to second
</p>
<p>the motion of the Liberator ; that he had expressed
</p>
<p>some very strong opinions on the Loughrea meeting ;
</p>
<p>that he considered that meeting more important than

</p>
<p>Dr. Gray was at that meeting ; he read the names

<p>of certain persons, whom he moved should be ap-

<p>pointed arbitrators; Mr. O'ConneU seconded the
</p>
<p>motion, and it was carried ; Dr. Gray then said he

<p>had a short report from the arbitration committee

<p>to present, and he had to move that some gentlemen

<p>be appointed arbitrators, the first of whom was a

<p>gentleman who was recommended by no less than

<p>eight millions of people ; he was known by the name

</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  Look at page 35, and read what
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell said upon that occasion ?
</p>
<p>Witness read what Mr. O'Connell said, which was
</p>
<p>to the effect that the passages should he kept clear,
</p>
<p>and that Mr. Ray should have the passage clear on
</p>
<p>account of the necessity of messengers having facili-
</p>
<p>ties of admission with the manifold letters.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General Look at page 52, and see if any
</p>
<p>money was handed in by Dr. Gray?
</p>
<p>Witness  Yes, Ihave amemorandum to that effect,
</p>
<p>and there were several sums handed in by him ; I
</p>
<p>was never present at any meeting of the associa-
</p>
<p>tion when applications were made for newspapers.
</p>
<p>At this period the court and jury retired for a few
</p>
<p>minutes, and the witness being told by Mr. Hatchell
</p>
<p>that he might retire from the witness-box, did so.
</p>
<p>The examination in chief was resumed, when the
</p>
<p>jury returned.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General desired witness to look to his
</p>
<p>notes, and see if he had a report of the proceedings
</p>
<p>of the 9th October  to look to page 34, and see if

<p>any thing had been said by a person named Green

<p>Mr. Green of Liverpool  at the meeting at Calvert's

<p>Solicitor-General  That is enough.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes's direct examination closed here.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINATION OF MK. BOND HUGHES.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell, Q.O.  Mr. Hughes, you stated that
</p>
<p>the first occasion of your coming to L-eland was to
</p>
<p>attend the meeting at MuUaghmast ? It was.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Didy on come for that purpose ? I did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell (to the court)  It is suggested I
</p>
<p>should apprise the court on the part of wliich of the
</p>
<p>traversers I appear, so as not to interfere with the
</p>
<p>counsel who have to cross-examine the witness for
</p>
<p>the other traversers. I appear for Mr. Ray. There
</p>
<p>are pieces of the evidence given in reference to other
</p>
<p>traversers, which the counsel who appear for these
</p>
<p>gentlemen will have occasion to advert to.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon said, on the part of the traver-
</p>
<p>sers, that it was not the intention of the different
</p>
<p>counsel for the traversers to cross-examine, except
</p>
<p>on some particular occasions. It was probable that
</p>
<p>not a single question would be asked of the present
</p>
<p>witness.
</p>
<p>The cross-examination was then resmned.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Have you, Mr. Hughes, been a pro-
</p>
<p>fessional reporter for the public press ? No, not for
</p>
<p>the public press.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  ^What was your business, then ? I
</p>
<p>am a short-hand writer.
</p>
<p>You never were on any public journal ? Never.
</p>
<p>Have you ever attended public meetings in Eng-
</p>
<p>land to report the proceedings at them ? I have.
</p>
<p>Have you for many years, previous to last, pur-
</p>
<p>sued that profession, and from an early period of
</p>
<p>your life ? I have.
</p>
<p>Were you particularly employed in England for
</p>
<p>164
</p>
<p>THE lEISH STATE TEIALS,
</p>
<p>I suppose you had a good yiew of the assembled
</p>
<p>persons? Yes, I had.
</p>
<p>The people came on the ground according to their
</p>
<p>parishes ? Yes.
</p>
<p>There were bands ? There were.
</p>
<p>Did you not understand them to be temperance
</p>
<p>bands? I cannot say anything about them.
</p>
<p>Did you see anything about them with regard to
</p>
<p>their dress or instruments to inform you? I saw
</p>
<p>some bands, and all I know is that they were bands.
</p>
<p>Did you see any banners ? Yes; I saw some with
</p>
<p>mottoes.
</p>
<p>Did you ever attend meetings in England at
</p>
<p>which there were either banners or mottoes ? I have
</p>
<p>never attended meetings where they have been used
</p>
<p>except at the time of Queen Caroline.
</p>
<p>Did you ever attend county meetings? I attended
</p>
<p>meetings of the Chartists in Manchester, and one in
</p>
<p>Carpenters' Hall.
</p>
<p>Did you ever attend an open air meeting ? No.
</p>
<p>Did you ever report any meetings about 1831 or
</p>
<p>1832? I was then only commencing reporting.
</p>
<p>Hjive you attended any of the great reform meet-
</p>
<p>ing^ ? 1 have no recollection of attending any of
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Perhaps you were only an apprentice then ? I was
</p>
<p>practising for myself at the time.
</p>
<p>Were there a great number of women and chil-
</p>
<p>dren mixed vnth the crowd at the meeting ? There
</p>
<p>were.
</p>
<p>Was not the meeting of a perfectly peaceable cha-
</p>
<p>racter altogether? It was.
</p>
<p>Have you, at that meeting, perceived anything in
</p>
<p>the least tending to riot or disturbance among the

</p>
<p>people themselves? Not the slightest.
</p>
<p>In what manner was the Queen's name received ?
</p>
<p>The Queen's name, when mentioned, was always
</p>
<p>received with loud applause ; after Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>arrival with his friends, I remember it was men-
</p>
<p>tioned that I was on the platform as the government
</p>
<p>reporter; on the announcement of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>that he understood there was a gentleman there re-
</p>
<p>presenting the government, I declared I was the per-
</p>
<p>son, and then Mr. O'Connell offered me every pos-
</p>
<p>sible facility and accommodation, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>reporting for the government ; he shook hands witli
</p>
<p>me, not upon that but upon a subsequent occasion ;
</p>
<p>I afterwards got a ticket of admission to the ban-
</p>
<p>quet for myself, and one for my assistant, Mr.
</p>
<p>Iiatham ; there was no secrecy at all about me and
</p>
<p>my assistant being there for the government ; a
</p>
<p>great number of persons of respectable appearance
</p>
<p>were at the banquet ; it commenced about five
</p>
<p>o'clock, and terminated somewhere about nine ; I
</p>
<p>left a few minutes before its termination ; at the
</p>
<p>banquet there was order and regularity among the
</p>
<p>persons present as well as among those at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing ; I saw at the meeting persons who had bands
</p>
<p>around their hats, and wlio called themselves O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's police ; I think those persons preserved order,
</p>
<p>and prevented the people from getting upon the
</p>
<p>hustings, and that the persons on the platform would
</p>
<p>he very much incommoded unless there were indi-
</p>
<p>viduals to preserve order ; I did not return to Dub-
</p>
<p>lin that night; I only went as far as Naas ; I did
</p>
<p>not transcribe any notes there; the Queen's health
</p>
<p>was given at the dinner, and received with very
</p>
<p>great applause ; I marked it so in my notes ; tlie

<p>maker at a public meeting ? No doubt of it (laugh-
</p>
<p>ter).
</p>
<p>You would have no objection to encourage native
</p>
<p>manufactures in any way you could ? Not the
</p>
<p>Bliglitest.
</p>
<p>You see no great liarm in that ? No.
</p>
<p>If Mr. Wliite could have made a cap to fit you,
</p>
<p>would you have worn it ? I did not wear it.
</p>
<p>Did you liandle the cap at all? I did not, but I
</p>
<p>admired it (laughter).
</p>
<p>Would it not be an excellent travelling-cap to go
</p>
<p>about with in the pocket ? It would (laughter).
</p>
<p>Do you not know that gentlemen who visit Paris
</p>
<p>often come back with tlie tricoloured Eepublican cap
</p>
<p>as a comfortable cap to sleep in ? I know they bring
</p>
<p>caps home with tliem sometimes.
</p>
<p>Now you, as a man of the world, did not tliink
</p>
<p>there was any treason in that cap ? I formed no
</p>
<p>opinion.
</p>
<p>Not wl^ether this is a cap to fit the crown or you
</p>
<p>have a crown to fit the cap ? E ither way you like it.
</p>
<p>Were you patriotic enough to buy anything to
</p>
<p>further Irish manufactures? I did (laughter.)
</p>
<p>I suppose you bought a tabinet for your lady ? I
</p>
<p>did (great laughter.)
</p>
<p>It was a great advantage then that you were brought
</p>
<p>so far for the encouragement of Irish manufactures,
</p>
<p>and if you had been disengaged you would liave no
</p>
<p>objection to have got a lady for the tabinet ? Pro-
</p>
<p>bably not (immense laughter).
</p>
<p>Indeed you might be worse off (great laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatcliell  How long did you remain in Ireland
</p>
<p>after the meeting at Mullaghmast ?
</p>
<p>Witness  I left on the 18th of October.

</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Did you attend a meeting of the re-
</p>
<p>peal association on the 2d of October ?
</p>
<p>Witness  Yes, I did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  How were you treated ? There, as
</p>
<p>at all the other meetings, I was treated with the
</p>
<p>greatest possible civility. I received every courtesy
</p>
<p>and kindness at the association.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  You only read such extracts from
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speeches, if I mistake not, as the
</p>
<p>Solicitor General requested you to read ?
</p>
<p>Witness  That was all.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Then you have notes of several
</p>
<p>other expressions which fell from Mi'. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>independently of the extracts which you read in
</p>
<p>court ?
</p>
<p>Witness  Oh, yes ; I have notes of very many
</p>
<p>passages from Mr. O'Connell's speeches whicli I did
</p>
<p>not read, but I will read any part you require.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Look through your notes, if you
</p>
<p>please, for some remarlis of Mr. O'Connell's on Rib-
</p>
<p>bonisra at the meeting of October 3d ; they come
</p>
<p>immediately before a letter from Tullow, signed by
</p>
<p>a person named Jacl^son.
</p>
<p>The witness looked over his notes, but was unable
</p>
<p>to find the passage alluded to.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  The passage I allude to came before
</p>
<p>the reading of a letter from Sharman Crawford ; but
</p>
<p>I rather think you have it not, for I believe you did
</p>
<p>not take notes until after the reading of that letter.
</p>
<p>Witness  The first remarks I have from Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell are in allusion to a meeting in Donegal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Read what Mr. O'Connell said on
</p>
<p>that subject if you please ?
</p>
<p>The witness here read from his notes the following
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>THE miSH STATE TRIAL&
</p>
<p>He would not give one straw for repeal if it were not
</p>
<p>carried without the shedding of one drop of human
</p>
<p>blood. The people stood by him, and would obey
</p>
<p>his advice, and he never saw a readier acquiescence
</p>
<p>in it than was exhibited on the preceding day at
</p>
<p>Mullaghmast. He would tell their friends in Ca-
</p>
<p>nada of that meeting  the most gigantic and mag-
</p>
<p>nificent assemblage that he had ever attended, with
</p>
<p>the single exception of Tara. Nothing could equal
</p>
<p>the beautiful scene that presented itself to the eye
</p>
<p>as they passed up the long avenue ascending the
</p>
<p>Mount of Mullaghmast  the countless thousands
</p>
<p>that lined the way  the many blaclt-eyed women 
</p>
<p>aye, and the beautiful women, too, that were there
</p>
<p>with their husbands, and fathers, and brothers.
</p>
<p>They did not entertain the least idea that there
</p>
<p>would be the smallest encroachment on their de-
</p>
<p>licacy, for there was not one man among the hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of thousands that were assembled who would
</p>
<p>not sooner have died than have offended one of
</p>
<p>them (cheers). They were there perfectly safe and
</p>
<p>secure in the high-souled lionour and protection of
</p>
<p>their countrymen  blessings on the lovely women of
</p>
<p>ICildare. And his (Mr. O'Connell's) police were
</p>
<p>there with bands upon their hats, and signifying
</p>
<p>they had authority to keep the peace if there
</p>
<p>was a necessity for keeping it, which there was
</p>
<p>not. Nothing could be more cruel than march-
</p>
<p>ing the unfortunate green-coated police to these
</p>
<p>meetings ; for wliat were they wanted there? If any
</p>
<p>of the stipendiary magistrates came to him he would
</p>
<p>tell him off as many men as would be sufficient to
</p>
<p>keep the peace (cheers). They might keep the po-
</p>
<p>lice at home and not liave them wearing their shoes

<p>traversing the country in cold weather (laughter).
</p>
<p>There were two things in the conduct of Sir Henry
</p>
<p>Hardinge and the government that he complained
</p>
<p>of, and this was marching abont the police in this
</p>
<p>way (they had given up the practice of harrassing
</p>
<p>the army, and he was glad of it), and having in for-
</p>
<p>tifying Athlone cut down two beautiful trees near
</p>
<p>its walls to make the fortifications more secure.
</p>
<p>A tree was a public loss to the country. He loved a
</p>
<p>fine old tree ; nature never produced anything more
</p>
<p>delightful to the eye than the waving branches of
</p>
<p>an aged tree that was still green and in vigour. He
</p>
<p>would forgive Sir Henry Hardinge anything but
</p>
<p>that. To come back to Canada West. Was it not
</p>
<p>delightful to them to have their brother Irishmen
</p>
<p>chirping to them from such a distance ? but he begged
</p>
<p>of them, as he did of Mr. O'Ferrall, not to abuse the
</p>
<p>Orapgemen so much, and to usecivil language to them.
</p>
<p>It was quite manifest they were not afraid of the
</p>
<p>Orangemen; and wliy then should they scold them?
</p>
<p>for persons only had recourse to scolding when they
</p>
<p>were afraid. He heartily thanked their friends in
</p>
<p>Canada West ; but he was glad that they had got
</p>
<p>over their rebellion, and that their country was now
</p>
<p>a free country, and had a parliament freely elected.
</p>
<p>The English government liad the good sense to let
</p>
<p>the Canadians govern Canada. All offices were
</p>
<p>filled by Canadians, or were being filled by them,
</p>
<p>and no man got into office wlio did not concur in
</p>
<p>opinion with the majority of the parliament. It
</p>
<p>showed how wise it was to give every dependency
</p>
<p>of England the power of self-government, with a
</p>
<p>local parliament; for Canada was now declared by
</p>
<p>the ministry themselves, to be, for the first time, in

<p>(cheers). My only condition is that you will not
</p>
<p>put yourselves in the power of our enemies ; and if
</p>
<p>you obey every tiling that has the form of law, the
</p>
<p>shape of law, or the pretence of law  if you do
</p>
<p>that you may set them at defiance. I tell you to
</p>
<p>have confidence in me. (Cries of, ' we have.') I may
</p>
<p>be sneered at for avowing it, but I say I deserve
</p>
<p>your confidence. (Cheers, and cries of ' hear, hear).'
</p>
<p>I think of you in my waking moments, and even in
</p>
<p>my dreams there is mixed up an anxiety for your
</p>
<p>safety (cheers). I want to carry the repeal of the
</p>
<p>union without one drop of blood ; without one
</p>
<p>crime ; without disturbing the social state or social
</p>
<p>order. I want to carry it in such a way that I can
</p>
<p>face my Redeemer at the moment of my account,
</p>
<p>and have no sin upon me to answer for from the ad-
</p>
<p>vice I offer in conducting the Irish people (cheers).
</p>
<p>I tell you that even were I to perish for it, obey the
</p>
<p>law, and the union will be repealed (cheers). I
</p>
<p>send that throughout Ireland. What I say here
</p>
<p>will pass thi'ough Ireland, even by this evening's
</p>
<p>newspapers, for I want in every part of Ireland to
</p>
<p>quiet the excitement, to put down the anxiety, to
</p>
<p>take away, to soothe and mitigate their feelings of
</p>
<p>just indignation at the manner in which the govern-
</p>
<p>ment desires to treat the people of Ireland at the pre-
</p>
<p>sent moment. Having enforced my obedience to the
</p>
<p>law, I next proclaim my thorough conviction that the
</p>
<p>conduct of the government was calculated in the high-
</p>
<p>est degree to produce the massacre of innocent people.

</p>
<p>they had done in the meeting to which they were
</p>
<p>addressed). I give notice of a plan, that on a cer-
</p>
<p>tain day yet to be appomted, every parish in Ire-
</p>
<p>land shall meet to seek the restoration of their
</p>
<p>native legislature. Before the next sitting of par-
</p>
<p>liament it will be necessary to hold two of these
</p>
<p>simultaneous parochial meetings of universal Ire-
</p>
<p>land (cheers.) The first for the due exposition of
</p>
<p>their grievances and the drawing up of the petitions
</p>
<p>to the imperial parliament. The second to have
</p>
<p>these petitions adopted and signed man by man.
</p>
<p>These meetings will take place after mass, and the
</p>
<p>necessary business will be transacted in the little
</p>
<p>yards or enclosures attached to the chapel. I want
</p>
<p>to know how they will prevent our meeting to peti-
</p>
<p>tion simultaneously throughout Ireland, although
</p>
<p>they may prevent our meeting in multitudes. To
</p>
<p>arrange this was one of my reasons for giving up
</p>
<p>monster meetings ; but I have still something more
</p>
<p>to work out. I shall also carry into operation the
</p>
<p>plan of our arbitration courts universally. In tliis
</p>
<p>I believe the proclamation will give us no small
</p>
<p>help. Obey the law, and I promise you security
</p>
<p>and liberty. Europe and the world shall know our
</p>
<p>grievances and our virtues. They shall know our

<p>determination, our full and fixed resolution, never
</p>
<p>to be guilty of a crime  never to commit an oifence
</p>
<p>never to stain our cause by the shedding of one

<p>drop of human blood  and never to violate a single

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>was the toast Mr. Barrett spoke to at the Mullagh-
</p>
<p>mast dinner ?
</p>
<p>The witness considered for a short time, and then
</p>
<p>replied, "The People."
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Look to your note of the meet-
</p>
<p>ing held on the 9th of October in Abbey-street?
</p>
<p>Witness  I have got it.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Enumerate the names of the
</p>
<p>traversers who were present at that meeting ? John
</p>
<p>O'Connell, D. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, the Kev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tyrrell, Dr. Gray, Mr. Duify, and Mr. Ray.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  You have not named Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett  was he there ? I made a mistake about him
</p>
<p>on a former occasion  he was not present.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Then, I presume, he did not
</p>
<p>speak there ? He did not.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  When you were under examina-
</p>
<p>tion by the Solictor-General he asked you nothing
</p>
<p>about the dhiner at the Kotundo  was Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>there? Mr. Barrett was not there either. I mis-
</p>
<p>took somebody else for liim.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  I think you stated you took the
</p>
<p>earliest opportunity of correcting your mistake ? I
</p>
<p>did.
</p>
<p>When was it ? At the house of Judge Burton.
</p>
<p>Were you at the house of Judge Burton at the
</p>
<p>time the recognizances were entered into, and did
</p>
<p>you then swear informations ? I saw Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>there ; I did not swear my information on that but
</p>
<p>on a prior occasion ; I swore an affidavit that day ;
</p>
<p>it was an amended affidavit.
</p>
<p>Do I understand you to say you amended the mis-
</p>
<p>take with reference to Mx. Barrett by affidavit. I
</p>
<p>did not.

<p>Were you present on the occasion when the re-
</p>
<p>cognizance to bail was subscribed by Mr. Barrett ?
</p>
<p>Yes, I then amended tlie mistake ; I mentioned it
</p>
<p>to Mr. Rae and Mr. Kemmis.
</p>
<p>Were they attending for the crown ? Yes, Mr.
</p>
<p>Eae is conducting clerk to Mr. Kemmis.
</p>
<p>Did j'ou apprise them of tlie mistake with respect
</p>
<p>to Mr. Barrett? I mentioned to them I had a doubt
</p>
<p>about having been correct in stating Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>was at the meeting.
</p>
<p>When was this? On leaving Judge Burton's
</p>
<p>house.
</p>
<p>What did Mr. Kemmis say ? I can't recollect
</p>
<p>what Mr. Kemmis said.
</p>
<p>Where was this ? In Kildare-street.
</p>
<p>Before you reached Mr. Kemmis's house ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Can you not recollect what Mr. Kemmis said on
</p>
<p>the way ? He made no observation.
</p>
<p>Then it was left as it was ? I mentioned it to Mr.
</p>
<p>Eae before leaving Judge Burton's house.
</p>
<p>When ? On leaving the room, in the passage.
</p>
<p>Was Mr. Barrett then in the house ? He was.
</p>
<p>AVhat did you say ? " I was mistaken in regard
</p>
<p>to Mr. Barrett ; I had a doubt that he was at the

<p>Rotundo, or at the meeting at Calvert's theatre.''

<p>AVhat did Mr. Kae say ? I do not recollect what
</p>
<p>he said.
</p>
<p>Did you return to have the error corrected ? I

<p>did not take any steps furtlier ; I thought it enough
</p>
<p>to inform them of it.
</p>
<p>'llien it was the mistake as to Mr. Tierney that
</p>
<p>was corrected by affidavit ? Yes. I did not correct
</p>
<p>the mistake as to Mr. Barrett; I merely men-

<p>EXAMINATION OF MR. FLEMING MATHIAS LATHAM.
</p>
<p>Examined by Mr. Bennett, Q.C I know the
</p>
<p>gentleman who gave evidence last ; I came over
</p>
<p>to Ireland with him for the purpose of being his
</p>
<p>assistant ; I was present at the meeting at Mul-
</p>
<p>laglimast; I have been engaged in taking notes
</p>
<p>for the last ten years ; I transcribed Mr. Hughes's
</p>
<p>notes from his dictation ; that was a very long time
</p>
<p>after the meeting at Mullaghmast ; Hughes took the
</p>
<p>notes in short-hand and read them to me, and I
</p>
<p>transcribed them in long-liand ; I know Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>uell ; I have seen him in London ; I took notes at
</p>
<p>the meeting for my own amusement, but not full
</p>
<p>notes ; my sole object was to assist Mr. Hughes ; he
</p>
<p>is a particular friend of mine, and I wished to come
</p>
<p>over to Ireland and see the countrj' ; I copied some
</p>
<p>resolutions at the banquet which were thrown upon
</p>
<p>the table to the best of ray belief by Mr. Ray, but
</p>
<p>I am not certain that it was by Mr. Ray ; I at-
</p>
<p>tended a meeting of the association on the Monday
</p>
<p>following the Mullaghmast meeting ; that was on
</p>
<p>the 2d of October ; I was not present at the associa-
</p>
<p>tion on the 3d of October ; Mr. Hughes liad obtained
</p>
<p>two tickets of admission, one of which I got ; I saw
</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes get those tickets from a person who I
</p>
<p>think was Mr. Ray.

</p>
<p>You say you copied resolutions that were thrown
</p>
<p>upon the table? I did.
</p>
<p>Were those the resolutions or papers that had
</p>
<p>been read as resolutions at the dinner ? I cannot
</p>
<p>positively swear to the exact words, but they were
</p>
<p>the same resolutions in substance.
</p>
<p>What became of those resolutions ? They went
</p>
<p>round the table amongst the reporters, and I saw no
</p>
<p>more of them.
</p>
<p>Did you see the newspapers in which these reso-
</p>
<p>lutions were published ? I did.
</p>
<p>Did not those newspapers contain correct ac-
</p>
<p>counts
</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett objected to that question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Did you not read the newspa-
</p>
<p>pers afterwards ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General I object to this line of
</p>
<p>examination. Mr. Fitzgibbon may identify any
</p>
<p>newspapers, and put them in in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I think the trial, my lord, will
</p>
<p>be long enough without adopting that course. I,
</p>
<p>therefore, withdraw the question.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINED BY MB. MOORE.
</p>
<p>I understood you to say that it was Mr. Ray who
</p>
<p>gave the tickets of admission to the association, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes knows that it was Mr. Ray? Certainly
</p>
<p>he did. He must have known him, as he had be-
</p>
<p>come acquainted with him at Mullaghmast.

<p>witness ? I am not going to interfere with you,
</p>
<p>but merely wish to ask if you are going to call ano-
</p>
<p>ther witness ?
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  Yes, my lord.

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>When yon were here, did you make any report to
</p>
<p>that newspaper ? I did assist
</p>
<p>Counsel for the traverser again objected to the
</p>
<p>witness then going into any explanation.
</p>
<p> Sergeant Warren  Have you a copy of the notes
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell's speech ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect, or can you state whether, in the
</p>
<p>outset of that speech, he spoke of the physical force
</p>
<p>of the people surrounding him ? He did.
</p>
<p>Then state the language ? Am I to read the part
</p>
<p>that relates to that, or shall I read through the
</p>
<p>speech ?
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  If they require it at the other
</p>
<p>side.
</p>
<p>The witness then proceeded to read a report of
</p>
<p>the speech delivered by Mr. O'Connell at the Donny-
</p>
<p>hrook meeting. There were two blanks in the
</p>
<p>speech, and he stated he left those blanks because
</p>
<p>he had not been able to hear the sentences delivered
</p>
<p>at those particular points of his address by the
</p>
<p>speaker.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  Can you form any particular
</p>
<p>idea of the numbers assembled on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>I did form an opinion.
</p>
<p>What was your estimate of the number? I
</p>
<p>thought about 40,000.
</p>
<p>Where were you placed ? On the scaffold (laugh-
</p>
<p>ter) ; on the hustings.
</p>
<p>Were you in the same place with Mr. O'Connell?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>Did you see any bands accompanying the multi-
</p>
<p>tude there ? Yes.
</p>
<p>AVas there any procession independent of the
</p>
<p>bands ? The people came with the bands in procession.

</p>
<p>Was there anything else peculiar in the procession
</p>
<p>that struck you ? The great number of flags.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect any inscriptions or mottoes on
</p>
<p>the flags ? No.
</p>
<p>Did you see Mr. O'Connell as he approached the
</p>
<p>meeting ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Was there anything remarkable carried before
</p>
<p>him ?^-Not that I observed ; there was great con-
</p>
<p>fusion ; I had to descend from the stool, or place
</p>
<p>on which I was standing, and those around were
</p>
<p>above me.
</p>
<p>How long was the meeting assembled there that
</p>
<p>day ? I think it was not more than two hours from
</p>
<p>the beginning of the speecliing until the conclusion.
</p>
<p>Did you remain in Ireland after that? I re-
</p>
<p>mained the next day, and I think I went away the
</p>
<p>day after that ; I am not sure that I remained ano-
</p>
<p>ther day.
</p>
<p>When did you return again to Ireland ? At the
</p>
<p>end of August last.
</p>
<p>Were you acquainted with any of the traversers,
</p>
<p>or did you see any of them at that meeting around
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell? I saw Mr. John O'Connell, but I
</p>
<p>don't recollect that I saw any other.
</p>
<p>Did you attend any meeting of the association
</p>
<p>before you left here in the month of July ? No.
</p>
<p>What day in September did you return ? It was
</p>
<p>in the latter end of August.
</p>
<p>Did you attend any meeting of the association
</p>
<p>after your return ? I did.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect the day that you first attended a
</p>
<p>meeting of the association ? I do ; I think it was
</p>
<p>the 27th it waS the 28th of August. That was
</p>
<p>the first meeting I attended.

<p>The document was accordingly handed in, and the

<p>FXFTR DAY.
</p>
<p>Friday, Jandary 19.
</p>
<p> The court sat at 10 o clock. The intense interest
</p>
<p>which prevailed on the former days was, if possible,
</p>
<p>increased. When the judges had taken their seats
</p>
<p>the case was proceeded with.
</p>
<p>The jury having been called over, and having an-
</p>
<p>swered to their names,
</p>
<p>Mr. Ross, whose evidence occupied a considerable
</p>
<p>portion of the day previous, was again called and
</p>
<p>his examination continued on the part of the crown
</p>
<p>by Sergeant WaVren  He deposed that he was present
</p>
<p>at a meeting of the repeal association, which took
</p>
<p>place on the 28th of August ; that meeting was at-
</p>
<p>tended by three of the traversers  Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell, and Mr. Ray ; witness has a
</p>
<p>note of Mr. O'Connell's speech on that occasion, in
</p>
<p>which he adverted to a plan which he had introduced
</p>
<p>at some previous meeting for the reconstruction of
</p>
<p>the Irish parliament. [He read the extract in ques-
</p>
<p>tion from Mr. O'Connell's speech.] Has not in liis
</p>
<p>notes a copy of a letter read that day from Mallow,
</p>
<p>hut thinks he has a detailed manuscript copy of it.
</p>
<p>This manuscript was written partly at the associa-
</p>
<p>tion, and partly from my notes.
</p>
<p>Look and see if you have a letter dated from Mal-
</p>
<p>low, and purporting to be written by Richard Bar-
</p>
<p>nett Barry, which was read at that meeting?
</p>
<p>Witness (reading from his short-hand notes)

<p>ly a mioisterial production, and deserved to be cha-
</p>
<p>racterised, as it was by the Morning Chronicle, as the
</p>
<p>essence of stupidity. He then adverted to the plan
</p>
<p>he proposed at the last meeting for the constitution
</p>
<p>of the Irish parliament, and lie said he would take
</p>
<p>up as the basis of it the census returns of 1831,
</p>
<p>which could not be supposed to have been framed
</p>
<p>for any purpose connected with the Repeal of tlie
</p>
<p>Union. He was disposed to adhere to that census,
</p>
<p>except where it was mentioned that some error ex-
</p>
<p>isted in the details. He had received a letter from
</p>
<p>Mallow "
</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren  That's what I want. Where
</p>
<p>is that letter ? I have not a copy of it j it is not
</p>
<p>here.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  Well, we cannot help it. What
</p>
<p>did Mr. O'Connell say in reference to that letter ?
</p>
<p>He said that he thought that a fair case was made
</p>
<p>out for giving Mallow two members, and he pro-
</p>
<p>posed that the letter should be referred to a com-
</p>
<p>mittee, to inquire whether any change should be
</p>
<p>made in the plan with reference to that town, which
</p>
<p>was agreed to after some further observations.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Have you any notes of what you call
</p>
<p>further observations ? I have read them.
</p>
<p>Witness continued to read from his notes the speech
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell, the material parts of which are as
</p>
<p>follow: "There are many candidates for the pre-
</p>
<p>servative association. Gentlemen of the first for-
</p>
<p>tune and of the highest rank are daily proposing to
</p>
<p>me that they should be named as candidates for it ;
</p>
<p>there will be no difficulty whatever in getting 100
</p>
<p>gentlemen. I am speaking entirely by anticipation.

<p>We must keep within the letter and spirit of the

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  The witness has said that he
</p>
<p>took a full note.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  He has said that he took notes of such
</p>
<p>portions as lie thought material.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren (to witness)  Have you taken
</p>
<p>a note, to the best of your skill and judgment, of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speech on that occasion ? I have ;
</p>
<p>I beUeve I hare the entire ; I can always tell when
</p>
<p>I have taken a thing consecutively, and when I have
</p>
<p>taken only the heads of the subject ; the government
</p>
<p>accepted my services on one condition.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Now, don't make a speech. I object,
</p>
<p>my lord, to this witness going on. He swears he
</p>
<p>did not take all of the speech.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  If I do not mistake, he swore
</p>
<p>he had taken a full note.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Pardon me
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell  Let Sergeant Warren ask tlie
</p>
<p>question again.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren (to witness)  Have you taken
</p>
<p>the entire of that speech ? I know I have, because
</p>
<p>it's all consecutive.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  All consecutive I
</p>
<p>Witness  I can always tell when I have taken
</p>
<p>only a branch of a speech.
</p>
<p>Witness took up a bundle of notes.
</p>
<p>Ml'. Henn  Now, tell me are those full notes, or
</p>
<p>loose abstracts in them ? I cannot depose to a fact
</p>
<p>of which I know nothing (roai-s of laughter).
</p>
<p>The witness, in reply to Sergeant Warren, said 
</p>
<p>I have not as yet seen my notes at all, so that there
</p>
<p>may be a blank in them, or there may not be a blank
</p>
<p>in them.

</p>
<p>say if you have taken an entire note of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech on that occasion or not ? (The wit-
</p>
<p>ness looked at his note book for some time, and said)
</p>
<p> I don't think I have a full note of all that occurred
</p>
<p>that day ; but I have taken such a note as enables
</p>
<p>me to give a description of it.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  I submit, my lord, we are
</p>
<p>entitled to have tliis evidence, and it will be then for
</p>
<p>the jury to say how they will receive it.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin Did you observe the last answer
</p>
<p>the witness has given ? He says he did not take a
</p>
<p>full note of the speech, but such a note as would
</p>
<p>enable him to give a description.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn And I submit that is not evidence,
</p>
<p>because he cannot say anything except what is in
</p>
<p>his notes, and he admits he did not take a full note
</p>
<p>of the speech.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Let us take down his answer cor-
</p>
<p>rected, and see what it is. What is your answer
</p>
<p>Mr. Koss ? I have taken a full note of all that I
</p>
<p>considered important and material in that speech ;
</p>
<p>for instance, I will give you, my lords, an example
</p>
<p>of the sort of notes I took. When I came to a pas-
</p>
<p>ifage in the speech which I considered material I
</p>
<p>took it down ; for instance, there is a passage in the
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. O'Connell, when speaking of the
</p>
<p>union, where he states that trade and manufac-
</p>
<p>tures had fallen off greatly in consequence of the
</p>
<p>bligliting effects of the union. I considered that
</p>
<p>material and took it down.
</p>
<p>Counsel  The falling of trade and manufacture is
</p>
<p>rather material certainly for this country.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  If I understood you correctly
</p>
<p>your answer is this  you took a portion, or part, of

<p>proceedings, lie was not entitled to use it. By the
</p>
<p>strict rule the witness could examine his notes to
</p>
<p>refresh liis memory, and he must rely on tliat then.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  I think you confine your ob-
</p>
<p>jection to the short summary taken of the speech
</p>
<p>by the witness, or do you extend it to the words
</p>
<p>that he is really able to swear to ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I object to Ms entire evidence,
</p>
<p>unless he has taken a full note of all that passed :
</p>
<p>and I therefore submit his evidence cannot be re-
</p>
<p>ceived.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  I understand ; that is quite
</p>
<p>sufficient.
</p>
<p>Cliief Justice  "We will admit the evidence, con-
</p>
<p>sidering that we are acting in conformity with the
</p>
<p>well-known principles of the law.
</p>
<p>Mr. Warren  Proceed and state as fully as you
</p>
<p>can, from your notes, the speech of Mr. O'Connell ;
</p>
<p>and when you come to the portion whicli you have
</p>
<p>not taken fully, or where your notes are imijerfect,
</p>
<p>state so. The witness proceeded to read the speech
</p>
<p>of }iir. O'Connell for a few minutes, and then ad-
</p>
<p>dressing the court, said, " Now, my lords, I have
</p>
<p>come to the point at which my notes are not so full
</p>
<p>shall I read it ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  ^Do you object, Mr.
</p>
<p>Henn?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  If the witness can give the substance
</p>
<p>and meaning we do not, my lord. We call upon him
</p>
<p>to go on.
</p>
<p>The witness then proceeded to read  " Tlie union

<p>well for Ireland. I deny that. From the declara-
</p>
<p>tion of independence in the year 1782, up to the
</p>
<p>year 1799, there never jras a country progressed
</p>
<p>more rapidly, and I have the authority of Lord
</p>
<p>Clare to that etFect. Before emancipation no man
</p>
<p>spoke of repeal but myself ; I always looked upon
</p>
<p>the relief bill only as the means to an end  but a
</p>
<p>step to repeal ; and lest that should happen which
</p>
<p>has since happened, namely, that I should be accused
</p>
<p>of suppressing from the people of England my inten-
</p>
<p>tion ultimately to seek for it, I always declared my
</p>
<p>determination. In my address to the electors of
</p>
<p>Clare, in the year 1S28, a contest whicli was of such
</p>
<p>importance in effecting CathoUc emancip.ation, I
</p>
<p>distinctly put it forward as an inducement to the
</p>
<p>electors to vote for me, and I promised that if I ob-
</p>
<p>tained a seat in parUament I would bring the mea-
</p>
<p>sure before the house. I have now, for the last
</p>
<p>time, vindicated myself from the charge of conceal-
</p>
<p>ing my intention, and I ivill read an extract from
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Driscoll's book, dedicated to the Marquis of
</p>
<p>Lansdowne." The witness then said he had not
</p>
<p>taken a note of the extract.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Are you able, from memory, to give
</p>
<p>the substance of thiit extract ? I am not. Witness
</p>
<p>then proceeded to read the remainder of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech, where he stated, that from the year
</p>
<p>1800 to 1828, the Britisli constitution was only in
</p>
<p>existence in Ireland during the interval of five years,
</p>
<p>and stated Mr. O'Cohnell referred to various acts of
</p>
<p>parliament passed during that time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Are you able, from memory, to sup-
</p>
<p>ply the substance of what was said ? No.

<p>of Scotland and the disturbances in Wales). It is
</p>
<p>my opinion that the Legislative Union is inconsis-
</p>
<p>tent with any good object whatever  that instead of
</p>
<p>being essential to the strength and stability of the
</p>
<p>empire, it tends to produce weakness and decay 
</p>
<p>that instead of being a bond of connection between
</p>
<p>the two countries, it is the very thing which puts
</p>
<p>the continued connection in jeopardy. Circum-
</p>
<p>stanced as Ireland is, I am perfectly convinced that
</p>
<p>if the Union is not repealed by legal and consti-
</p>
<p>tutional means, and, above aU, if it does not take
</p>
<p>place during my lifetime, the result will be a san-
</p>
<p>guinary struggle for perpetual separation, and God
</p>
<p>forbid that any unjustifiable means should be used !
</p>
<p>I do not say this is a natural or unavoidable result :
</p>
<p>all I say is, while I live I hope my countrymen will
</p>
<p>not despair. As long as I Uve, at least, I will strug-
</p>
<p>gle legitimately and constitutionally ; and Ibequeath
</p>
<p>to those who follow me their own course of proceed-
</p>
<p>ing. He concluded by a motion for a committee to
</p>
<p>prepare an address to be placed before the Queen
</p>
<p>and all her subjects."
</p>
<p>Mr. Warren  Was the motion agreed to ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Have you taken a memorandum of any approba-
</p>
<p>tion or (fisapprobation of any part of that speech ?
</p>
<p>No ; I was present at a meeting of the association on
</p>
<p>the 4th of September ; Mr. O'Conuell, Mr. Ray,
</p>
<p>Mr. John O'Connell, and Mr. Steele, were present ;
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell spoke at the meeting.
</p>
<p>The witness then commenced reading liis note of
</p>
<p>what Mr. O'Connell spoke on that occasion. He
</p>
<p>commenced by referring to the meeting which was
</p>
<p>to take place at Clontarf on the 8th of October, and
</p>
<p>to the prospects of success for the repeal. He then

<p>referred to the Queen's speech, and the effect which
</p>
<p>it produced on the Irish mind. " The ministers
</p>
<p>dared not to make that speech till the end of the
</p>
<p>session, when it could be exposed. A weak and mi-
</p>
<p>serable ministry was incapable of resorting to any
</p>
<p>other advice. He congratulated the people on the
</p>
<p>increase of the repeal feeling among them, and also
</p>
<p>on the symptoms that were apparent of a better tem-
</p>
<p>per among the high-flying ' Orangemen of the North. '
</p>
<p>He mentioned the surprise he felt at seeing a sen-
</p>
<p>sible letter with the name of Londonderry attached
</p>
<p>to it. He denied that the speech from the throne
</p>
<p>was the personal speech of the Sovereign  it was
</p>
<p>not a personal speech at all ; it was no more the
</p>
<p>Queen's speech than it was his (Mr. O'C's.), and he
</p>
<p>was not very likely to pronounce a speech of that
</p>
<p>kind. The suggestion contained in that speech was
</p>
<p>grossly disloyal ; it was disloyal to represent the
</p>
<p>Queen to the people of Ireland as hostile to their
</p>
<p>liberty." He then called attention to the letter in
</p>
<p>the Morning Chronicle, signed " One who Whistled
</p>
<p>at the Plough," from which he read extracts. He
</p>
<p>pointed out the injury done to the reform cause in
</p>
<p>England by the physical force doctrine of the Char-
</p>
<p>tists, and warned the people strongly against vio-
</p>
<p>lence of any kind. He said the resolution for the
</p>
<p>non-consumption of exciseable articles was not yet
</p>
<p>proposed ; it was saved for a great emergency. He
</p>
<p>should shrink from nothing. He announced his in-
</p>
<p>tention of attending meetings at Loughrea and
</p>
<p>Connemara in the following week, where he would
</p>
<p>defy the spies and informers of England to produce

</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren You said you had a note of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speech at the dinner at Loughrea,
</p>
<p>pray be so good as to read it.
</p>
<p>[The witness here read from his note-book his
</p>
<p>note of Mr. O'Connell's speech on the occasion in
</p>
<p>question. The speech commenced with a denuncia-
</p>
<p>tion of the Tories for having put into the mouth of
</p>
<p>the Sovereign a speech, in the sentiments of which
</p>
<p>Bhe did not herself concur, for the paltry purpose
</p>
<p>of keeping themselves another year in office. He
</p>
<p>expressed a hope th.at what he uttered might reach
</p>
<p>the ears of her Majesty, and that she would learn
</p>
<p>that from the accession of her family to the throne,
</p>
<p>up to the present day, justice had never been done
</p>
<p>to this country.]
</p>
<p>Witness Then, my lords, Mr. O'Connell pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to denounce George the First, George the

<p>Second, George the Third, and George the Fourth ;

<p>The witness complied, and read his notes, the sub-
</p>
<p>stance of which was, that the Irish people had ever
</p>
<p>been distinguished for their loyalty and allegiance
</p>
<p>to their Sovereign, and that they would never cease

<p>to be so distinguished, for that their loyalty was

<p>ing civil war upon the repealers, but that the people
</p>
<p>had not crouched to that threat, and that the me-
</p>
<p>nace, consequently, would not be repeated ; that the
</p>
<p>government had spent a greater portion of the
</p>
<p>session in forging an arms' bill ; and that he (Mr.
</p>
<p>O'ConneU) would get his arms branded in perpetual
</p>
<p>proof of the insolence and tyranny of the Saxon ;
</p>
<p>that the Irish people, if they were unanimous, and
</p>
<p>did not violate any law, must succeed in obtaining
</p>
<p>their liberties; and that they ought to humble
</p>
<p>themselves before Providence for the purpose of im-
</p>
<p>ploring that the virtue of perseverance might be
</p>
<p>vouchsafed to them, and that the wisdom might be
</p>
<p>granted to their leaders to conduct them in the
</p>
<p>paths of peace and tranquillity into the temple of
</p>
<p>genuine and rational liberty, which was founded
</p>
<p>upon religion and morality. " I tell the Times that
</p>
<p>those meetings are the safety-valves through which
</p>
<p>the boiling wrongs of the national soul" (witness
</p>
<p>Remarks " I have lost the next word after soul, but
</p>
<p>I Buppos^ it was evaporate") " into the certainty of
</p>
<p>success ; they raise in them (the people) a divine
</p>
<p>hope that the days of the woes of Ireland will not
</p>
<p>last for ever." The witness continued at length to
</p>
<p>read the speech of Mr. O'Connell in nearly the
</p>
<p>same terms as previously published, until he came
</p>
<p>to the following passage :  " Ireland wants no mo-

<p>narchy."
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, who was sitting, as on the previous
</p>
<p>day, at the table, immediately under the witness's
</p>
<p>-cliair, here said, with the appearance of much
</p>
<p>astonishment, " No monarchy 1" I would make Mr.
</p>
<p>. O'Connell's meaning more clear if I were to write

<p>out another translation from my notes ; but this is

<p>provinces. (Cries of 'we are, wears.') Whether they
</p>
<p>did not hate Saxon tyranny as much as any other

<p>portion' (Cries of we do more so.') All he wanted
</p>
<p>was Ireland for the Irish, as France for the French,
</p>
<p>England for the English, and Scotland for the Scotch.
</p>
<p>The Irish were as brave, and more moral, than any
</p>
<p>other nation in the world. The battle of Ireland was
</p>
<p>to be a peaceable battle, and he would keep them out
</p>
<p>of danger. They should proceed in a constitutional
</p>
<p>way, but if he wanted them they would come again.
</p>
<p>He wanted that every person should pay his own
</p>
<p>clergyman ; the Protestants could then pay what
</p>
<p>they liked for their own church, and tlie more they
</p>
<p>paid the better. The struggle for emancipation was
</p>
<p>one for the advantage of the rich, but repeal would
</p>
<p>bring physical prosperity to the people. They were
</p>
<p>to use no violence. He came to teach them another
</p>
<p>lesson from that  that peace, order, and obedience to
</p>
<p>the law, were the means by which they would wrest
</p>
<p>everything from their enemies. If they had the re-
</p>
<p>peal prosperity would flow in upon them, and would
</p>
<p>they not give a shilling a-year for this object ?
</p>
<p>Every sergeant paid a shilling to eacli recruit, to en-
</p>
<p>list and entrap him ; but he did not want to entr.ap
</p>
<p>them, but he told them Ireland should be for the
</p>
<p>Irish. He again repeated that no violence was to be
</p>
<p>used. His motto was  " Whoever committed a
</p>
<p>crime gave strength to the enemy." He could not
</p>
<p>be doing anything that was bad when he had the
</p>
<p>support and countenance of the sainted clergy of the
</p>
<p>people, and their venerated archbishops. When they
</p>
<p>found him possessed of such support they did say
</p>
<p>that he must be doing some good. Then came the

<p>on that occasion connected with the arbitration

</p>
<p>Have the goodness to read them ?

<p>Witness then read one of the documents. It was

<p>an unfilled notice to the effect that an Arbitration

<p>Have you any other document connected with tlie

<p>arbitration courts ? Yes ; but not on that day.
</p>
<p>Other documents were handed to witness, and

<p>from them he selected one which was read hy the

<p>officer of the court. It was headed by a harp and

</p>
<p>submit their disputes to the arbitration and award

<p>of the arbitrators, and will therefore be careful
</p>
<p>never to enter on any case until both parties have
</p>
<p>consented to submit the cause of dispute to their
</p>
<p>decision. This consent should in general be had
</p>
<p>in ^vriting, and the name of the arbitrators, as well

<p>aa the cause of dispute, should be stated therein.
</p>
<p>The consent (wliicli is legally called a deed of sub-

<p>Sergeant Warren  Have you a note of that
</p>
<p>speech ? Yes, I have.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  Read it. The witness read
</p>
<p>from his manuscripts a note of a speech delivered
</p>
<p>by Dr. Gray, on the occasion in question. The sub-
</p>
<p>Stance of the speech was that he (Dr. Gray) as
</p>
<p>chairman of the arbitration committee, was com-
</p>
<p>toissioned to inform the association that the com-
</p>
<p>toittee had under their consideration the form of a
</p>
<p>testimonial in favour of such persons as they thought
</p>
<p>fit to recommend to the oflSoe of arbitrators, and he
</p>
<p>then proceeded to read the document alluded to, a
</p>
<p>copy of which the witness produced.
</p>
<p>Did any appointment of arbitrators take place
</p>
<p>that day ? I have a memorandum on my notes to
</p>
<p>the effect that several gentlemen were proposed as
</p>
<p>arbitrators and agreed to ; I know that Mr. Nugent,
</p>
<p>of Kingstown, was appointed, and returned thanks,
</p>
<p>and Dr. Gray moved that the chairman should be
</p>
<p>recommended as an arbitrator for Dundrum, where-
</p>
<p>upon the chairman returned thanks; I was present
</p>
<p>at the Mullaghraast meeting; I took a note of the
</p>
<p>|)roceedings of that meeting, which I hold in my hand
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren said there were certain extracts
</p>
<p>from the speech, as reported by the witness, which
</p>
<p>he wished to have read out. He wished to know
</p>
<p>whether the counsel for the traversers had any ob-
</p>
<p>jection to having certain extracts read from the
</p>
<p>speech, or did they mean to insist, as they had a
</p>
<p>right to do, that the entire speech should be read
</p>
<p>over again. It would be in the recollection of the

<p>court that tlie speech had already been read in its

<p>apply to the court uot to receive the incomplete
</p>
<p>note. I do not think it fair.
</p>
<p>Sergeant AVarren (to witness)  Have you a com-
</p>
<p>plete note of any part of Mr. Barrett's speech ? If
</p>
<p>you have not, I won't ask you a word about it.
</p>
<p>Witness (having looked over his notes)  No, sir.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  I should be very sorry to ask
</p>
<p>you to give any statement on it. You said you had
</p>
<p>a complete note of Mr. O'Connell's speech at the
</p>
<p>dinner ; will you read it ?
</p>
<p>The witness went on to read the speech made by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell which took place at the MuUagh-
</p>
<p>mast dinner. He (Mr. O'Connell) asked on that
</p>
<p>occasion was there any repealer brought before a
</p>
<p>bench charged with any crime ? was there any of
</p>
<p>them brought before a magistsate for a breach of
</p>
<p>the peace ? No, not one. They (the Irish people)
</p>
<p>had made a moral demonstration which no country
</p>
<p>on the face of the earth was capable of producing
</p>
<p>save Ireland. They (the Irish) had met in immense
</p>
<p>numbers without the slightest violation of the laws
</p>
<p>of God or man, and yet that country and such a
</p>
<p>people were enslaved. Mr. O'Connell then spoke
</p>
<p>something about the cold water cure, but I did not
</p>
<p>catch it (laughter). Mr. O'Connell continued,
</p>
<p>and said the only way to obtain the repeal of the
</p>
<p>union was by the peaceful workings of the Irish
</p>
<p>people themselves ; they would not commit a breach
</p>
<p>of the peace ; they would not commit a violation of
</p>
<p>the law. He went on to read that portion of the
</p>
<p>speech relative to the Duke of Wellington, in which
</p>
<p>it was stated that if a man happened to be born in a
</p>
<p>stable it did not make him a horse, amidst loud
</p>
<p>laughter.

</p>
<p>Will you state what time you came to Ireland
</p>
<p>first? The iirst time I came was in July, 1843; I
</p>
<p>was never here before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Were you much frightened at the Idea
</p>
<p>of coming over? Yes, I was frightened a little.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I suppose you found the alarm false ?
</p>
<p>Why, yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I suppose you were paid fairly for
</p>
<p>coming over ? Yes, I got 3501.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Altogether do you mean ? I got 501.
</p>
<p>for the Donnybrook, and 350/. for attending all the
</p>
<p>other meetings, aud up to the next session of par-
</p>
<p>liament.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  You have found it a profitable specu-
</p>
<p>latiou, then ? Yes, I have."
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Have you ever made as much money
</p>
<p>in as short a time before ? No, I have not ; I have
</p>
<p>sometimes made very well, sometimes not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Have you ever taken the benefit of
</p>
<p>the insolvent act ? 1 have once.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Only once ! when was that ? I was
</p>
<p>arrested on the 23th of June, and my petition was
</p>
<p>heard on the 25th of July, I think j it was some
</p>
<p>time before I came over.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  It could have been only afiw days,
</p>
<p>for you know you came over in the latter end of
</p>
<p>July ? I suppose so.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  You have stated that the employment
</p>
<p>you have undertaken Was suggested to you by some

<p>person on behaLf of the government  who was that

</p>
<p>I might (laughter). Or 75,000/. ? Witness I don't
</p>
<p>know.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn Would you come for 50,000/. ? No, I
</p>
<p>would not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Then this is your evidence  you
</p>
<p>might come for 100,000/. ; you don't know whether
</p>
<p>or not you would come for 75,000/. ? but you would
</p>
<p>not come for 50,000/. ?
</p>
<p>Witness  I mean that I would not be induced to
</p>
<p>come unless by something very large.
</p>
<p>Why would it be so hard to tempt you ? I was
</p>
<p>led to apprehend some damage.
</p>
<p>Well, now that you have come over, would you
</p>
<p>entertain the same apprehension? Now that I have
</p>
<p>seen how things are carried on, I would not have
</p>
<p>the same apprehension.
</p>
<p>Having been deputed by some oue liigh in office,
</p>
<p>and while in the employment of the Morning Chro-
</p>
<p>nicle, you came to Ireland ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Well, to whom did you apply on your arrival ?
</p>
<p>You came here to report the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>meeting held at Donnybrook  you could not report
</p>
<p>unless you had a place on the platform to hear and
</p>
<p>see, tell me to whom did you apply ? I do not know.
</p>
<p>How did you get to the meeting ? I went there
</p>
<p>with a gentleman connected with the Dublin Evening
</p>
<p>Post; he being well known did everything for me,
</p>
<p>and got me a place on the platform.
</p>
<p>You said when Mr. O'Connell arrived there was
</p>
<p>great confusion ? Yes.
</p>
<p>That was created by persons coming on the plat-
</p>
<p>form ? It was.
</p>
<p>There was no breach of the peace  no alarm ou
</p>
<p>your part? No.

<p>Mr. Henn  Was that on the same day ? Yes, it
</p>
<p>was on the Monday.
</p>
<p>Did you on that day copy the short-hand notes
</p>
<p>you took to furnish your report to the Chronicle ?
</p>
<p>Oh, no, I sent off by post that night, and it was not
</p>
<p>more than thirty lines ; I only wrote a portion of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speech, without referring to my
</p>
<p>notes at all.
</p>
<p>AVhen did you write out the report for the govern-
</p>
<p>ment ? On the next day.
</p>
<p>Is it a full report ? As full as possible, except in
</p>
<p>those portions to which I have referred.
</p>
<p>I understand you took a verbatim report of what
</p>
<p>you considered material ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You cannot be always precisely verbal ? Oh, no,
</p>
<p>and the change of a word might often make a very
</p>
<p>material ditference in the sense of a sentence.
</p>
<p>But of tliose parts you did not consider material
</p>
<p>you did not take ii note ? No.
</p>
<p>You took what you call topical notes of what took
</p>
<p>place ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Tell me what you mean by topical notes ? I mean
</p>
<p>the heads of the topics on which the speaker dwelt.

<p>CROSS-EXAMINATION OF ME. CHARLES ROSS.
</p>
<p>181
</p>
<p>nected  I mean my wife, whose wishes and feelings
</p>
<p>I always consult (much laughter among the ladies
</p>
<p>in the gallery, and the persons in the body of the
</p>
<p>court), and she was averse to my coming here as a
</p>
<p>government reporter. I had my own feelings, too,
</p>
<p>on the matter. A young artist who had been asked
</p>
<p>to come here to exhibit a celebrated picture, had, it
</p>
<p>was stated (about the time I first came over), re-
</p>
<p>fused to do so ; and when a gentleman of education
</p>
<p>(such as he) entertained apprehensions on the mat-
</p>
<p>ter, some allowance must be made for my having a
</p>
<p>reluctance to state why I came.
</p>
<p>WcU, then, I take it for granted that you would
</p>
<p>not undertake the business for 30,000/. ? You did
</p>
<p>not communicate the matter to the Morning Chroni-
</p>
<p>cle ? No.
</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Ross, you attended the Loughrea, Clif-
</p>
<p>den, and Mullaghmast raeeetings. Bid you send
</p>
<p>reports of the proceedings at each of these to the
</p>
<p>Chronicle ? I did not send the report of the Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast meeting to the Chronicle.
</p>
<p>You are acquainted with the person wlio repre-
</p>
<p>sented the Chronicle there ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Had you any communication with liim at that
</p>
<p>meeting ? Yes, he was close to me.
</p>
<p>Oh ! then yon know this gentleman ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You are quite sure you did not send that meeting
</p>
<p>to the Chronicle? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did the ChrmiicU pay you for that meeting ? The
</p>
<p>Chronicle paid me only for what I sent.
</p>
<p>Did you charge them anything for the Mullagh-
</p>
<p>mast meeting? Yes, I did. (ludicatious of sur-
</p>
<p>prise in the court.)
</p>
<p>How much did you charge for sending them no-

</p>
<p>thing? Oh, they got the MuUaghmast meeting.
</p>
<p>That gentleman then did the whole of the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, but you charged for it, and got the money?
</p>
<p>No.
</p>
<p>Wliat! AUow me to explain (witness, turning to
</p>
<p>the bench, said) I regret I must state those cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, but I am compelled to explain. This
</p>
<p>gentleman wanted some money to enable him to go
</p>
<p>to those meetings, in order to send reports to Lon-
</p>
<p>don; I advanced him money on several occasions
</p>
<p>for that purpose ; on this occasion, being run a
</p>
<p>little short, I wanted some money myself, and he
</p>
<p>could get no supply of money from London, and he
</p>
<p>therefore proposed that the JluUaghraast meeting
</p>
<p>should be sent over in my name, as I should be sure
</p>
<p>to get paid for it.
</p>
<p>Did you get the money from the Chronicle for that
</p>
<p>meeting ? I did, but I gave it to him.
</p>
<p>Having attended at those monster meetings here,
</p>
<p>may I ask you whether jou have ever, in the coui-se
</p>
<p>of your duties in England, attended at any of the
</p>
<p>great public meetings there? Not at many, but at
</p>
<p>some of them.
</p>
<p>At any of the Anti-Corn-Law leag-ue meetings?
</p>
<p>No ; I never reported any of them.
</p>
<p>Don't you tliink it very wrong that a reporter
</p>
<p>should be called upon to give evidence ? No, cer-
</p>
<p>tainly not. I think a reporter should obey the law
</p>
<p>of a country, and I never heard that questioned
</p>
<p>until I heard it by some gentlemen here. 'Tis pre-
</p>
<p>posterous (laughter).
</p>
<p>You were not always merely a i-eporter ? No.
</p>
<p>You were, I believe, an editor ? I was.
</p>
<p>Were you the editor of a newspaper called the
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>with a London newspaper in 1841, did not hear of a
</p>
<p>contested election in Carlisle at that period ? I tell
</p>
<p>you again I never heard of the names before.
</p>
<p>Was there a contested election in Carlisle in 1841 ?
</p>
<p>I really do not remember. If there was an election,
</p>
<p>it made no impression on my mind.
</p>
<p>And you say you don't know who the candidate
</p>
<p>was? I do not.
</p>
<p>Do you remember any election in Carlisle ? Yes ?
</p>
<p>there was an election in '39 or '40  it was an elec-
</p>
<p>tion for the county.
</p>
<p>Look to this placard  it is addressed to the work-
</p>
<p>ing classes of Carlisle ? I have looked at it, but
</p>
<p>never saw it until now. I may have seen it on the
</p>
<p>walls. Let me look at the date.
</p>
<p>(Witness then looked at the date, and said he
</p>
<p>mistook the date  he never saw that placard before.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn handed him another placard  an ad-
</p>
<p>dress to the working classes of Carlisle, and he said
</p>
<p>he never saw that either.
</p>
<p>Now, you edited the Carlisle Patriot in 1839 ? Tes!
</p>
<p>Look at tills ( handing him a printed document) 
</p>
<p>Have you any recollection of that ? I have not the
</p>
<p>slightest recollection of it.
</p>
<p>Was it not published in the Patriot as a leading
</p>
<p>article ? I do not know. I have no recollection of it.
</p>
<p>Can you say that that did not appear in your
</p>
<p>paper ? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>But it may have appeared ? It may, sir ; I can-
</p>
<p>not say it did not.
</p>
<p>The article to which I call j'our attention, says,
</p>
<p> " We protest in the most ardent manner against
</p>
<p>the conduct of the magistrates in compelling us to
</p>
<p>give evidence against the prisoner." Do you remem-
</p>
<p>ber those words ? I do not.

<p>Sergeant Warren begged to interrupt Mr. Henn.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I tliink I am entitled now to ask him
</p>
<p>will he swear that this was not inserted in the paper
</p>
<p>with his sanction ?
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  He has already stated that he
</p>
<p>has no recollection of having seen that document be-
</p>
<p>fore, and, therefore, you have no right to read one
</p>
<p>word of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Certainly not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Very well. I am entitled at all events
</p>
<p>to ask him this. Will you swear you did not, when
</p>
<p>editor of the Patriot, protest against reporters being
</p>
<p>examined ? I said before I did not.
</p>
<p>I know you did, but answer me again ? I did not
</p>
<p>make any such protest  even in this sentence which
</p>
<p>I have used (laughter), I made no such protest.
</p>
<p>Then you did use the sentence ? You mistake
</p>
<p>me ; I did not.*
</p>
<p>Were you in the habit of reporting in the bouse
</p>
<p>of commons ? Yes.
</p>
<p>I suppose you often reported Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speeches ? I did, very often.
</p>
<p>Did you ever state that you found considerable
</p>
<p>difSculty in following Mr. O'Connell? Yes, I did.
</p>
<p>And that is the fact ? Yes ; almost all reporters
</p>
<p>find diflBculty in following Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Now the Donnybrook meeting was perfectly quiet
</p>
<p>and peaceable ? It was.
</p>
<p>Was it not so at the Clifden meeting? It was.
</p>
<p>Was it not so at Loughrea ? It was.
</p>
<p>Was it not so at Mullaghmast ? It was.
</p>
<p>And at Clifden you saw men coming on horses,
</p>
<p>with their wives behind them (laughter) ? I did.
</p>
<p>And numbers of the cavalry without any saddles

<p>CEOSS- EXAMINATION OF ME. CHAELES EOSS,
</p>
<p>183
</p>
<p>Witness read the report of Mr. O'Connell's speech,
</p>
<p>which was to the following effect:  Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>said  " He is a respectable gentleman, and we can-
</p>
<p>not hesitate for a moment to insert his letter on the
</p>
<p>minutes. Mr. Napier insinuates that we commenced
</p>
<p>the attack on the Saxons ; he seems to forget that
</p>
<p>the severance of the two nations emanated from the
</p>
<p>highest quarter. I heard the Lord Chancellor of
</p>
<p>England state that the Irish were aliens in blood,
</p>
<p>in language, and in religion. Mr. O'Connor is no
</p>
<p>longer a member of the association, and though I
</p>
<p>approve of the resolution condemnatory of his no-
</p>
<p>tice, I regret he was treated with so much courtesy
</p>
<p>I regret that he was not taken by the shoulder and
</p>
<p>put out of the room. If he were honest, he would
</p>
<p>wait until I was present before he brought forward
</p>
<p>such a proposition."
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Was not this O'Connor a man who
</p>
<p>proposed interfering with property ? He was a man
</p>
<p>who proposed a resolution as to the non-payment of
</p>
<p>rent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Go on ; his name was Connor, and
</p>
<p>not O'Connor.
</p>
<p>The witness then proceeded to read the remainder
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Connell's speech, which was to the follow-
</p>
<p>ing effect:  " He should wait until I was in the
</p>
<p>room before he brought forward such a proposition.
</p>
<p>This was due to me as I am responsible for the legal
</p>
<p>formation of the association. But he took advan-
</p>
<p>tage of my absence to hold out a topic that would
</p>
<p>attract attention for a moment from persons who
</p>
<p>do not consider what would be the result, and by
</p>
<p>throwing out a political clap-trap try to make an
</p>
<p>impression that might be destructive of the asso-

</p>
<p>ciation. I was cautioned against him. He wrote
</p>
<p>a letter to the Freeman yesterday, in which he as-
</p>
<p>sumed a look of injured innocence. Tlie question
</p>
<p>of fixity of tenure is one of great importance. No
</p>
<p>country was ever prosperous in which it is not the
</p>
<p>object of men to acquire landed property, and we
</p>
<p>must not do anything that would make the land-
</p>
<p>lord's situation cease to be a desirable one. X am
</p>
<p>ready to do all that the landlord ought to desire,
</p>
<p>but I am convinced that there must be an end to
</p>
<p>the present relation between landlord and tenant.
</p>
<p>The power of exterminating must be taken away,
</p>
<p>and the sacredness of possession must be established."
</p>
<p>After referring to an account in the Momivg Chro-
</p>
<p>nicle of meetings held in Wales on the subject of
</p>
<p>tenure, and to a speech made by Lord Londonderry,
</p>
<p>the speech proceeded to the following effect:  " I
</p>
<p>now come back to Mr. Connor. Mr. Connor knew
</p>
<p>that a declaration not to pay rent charge is against
</p>
<p>an act of parliament, and that a combination not
</p>
<p>to pay rent is a direct infringement of the law j and
</p>
<p>it is the conviction of my mind that to a certain
</p>
<p>extent the safety of the association depends upon
</p>
<p>you all declaring with me, that the name of Mr.
</p>
<p>Connor should not remain on our books. If he
</p>
<p>wanted to do us mischief is not that the course he
</p>
<p>would take ? And shall I be told that he did not
</p>
<p>intend to do us an injury when he took that step ?
</p>
<p>I declare him a political enemy to the people of Ire-
</p>
<p>land. I will not mince the matter at all."
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Have you a note of a resolution with
</p>
<p>respect to Mr. Connor ?
</p>
<p>Witness  I have ; it is here, immediately after he
</p>
<p>moves .

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>last summer aiid last antumu; I attended at tlie
</p>
<p>meetings of the repeal association ; I was in the
</p>
<p>liabit of transmitting regularly to London by the
</p>
<p>l)ost, reports of what took place at those meetings.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  My lords, I wish to apprise you
</p>
<p>that it is not my intention to make this gentleman
</p>
<p>go over all the speeches which the court has already
</p>
<p>heard. I will confine myself almost exclusively to
</p>
<p>asking him who took part at the meetings. Take
</p>
<p>these documents in your hand, Mr. Jackson, and see
</p>
<p>whether they are the original notes which you sent
</p>
<p>to London ? Yes, they are.
</p>
<p>Is this paper which I now hand you your report
</p>
<p>of the meeting that was held on the 30th of May
</p>
<p>last ? It is.
</p>
<p>I wish you to look to page 3 of that report.
</p>
<p>I see it.
</p>
<p>Do you see in these notes a report of a speech
</p>
<p>made upon that occasion by Mr. O'Connell ? Yes,
</p>
<p>I do.
</p>
<p>Eead the first few lines.
</p>
<p>The witness proceeded to read the report, which
</p>
<p>commenced by noticing the fact of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>having directed the attention of the association to
</p>
<p>an error which appeared in the report of the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of the Longford repeal meeting, which had
</p>
<p>beeu published in the Freeman's Journal of the same
</p>
<p>date. In that report he was made to apply the
</p>
<p>phrase " ruffian soldiery" to the array of Great Bri-
</p>
<p>tain ; but he begged leave to state that he never
</p>
<p>used any such expression. The circumstance to
</p>
<p>which he had alluded in his Longford speech had
</p>
<p>reference to the pathetic ballad of " Aileen Aroon."
</p>
<p>He (Mr. O'C.) then proceeded in his customary

<p>strain to (laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster That will do.
</p>
<p>Go to page 6 now and read from tliat ; I believe
</p>
<p>you have not seen those manuscripts since you sent
</p>
<p>them to London ? I only got them from Mr. Kem-
</p>
<p>mis to initial.
</p>
<p>Take that document and refer to the meeting of
</p>
<p>June 6, at the association. I should observe, my
</p>
<p>lords, that this gentleman's evidence applies only to
</p>
<p>the meetings of the association at the Corn Ex-
</p>
<p>change, and nothing else.
</p>
<p>Look to page 1 and see which of the traversers
</p>
<p>were at that meeting ? Daniel O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Look to page 6 and see if there were any others
</p>
<p>of them there ? Yes, the member for ICilkenny, Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell, Mr. Barrett of the Pilot, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele.
</p>
<p>Now, go back to page 6, and read a portion of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speech. Witness reading, "He
</p>
<p>(Mr. O'C.) passed yesterday amid tlie scenes of
</p>
<p>Saxon cruelty, and the sanguinary Cromwellian,
</p>
<p>cold-blooded butcheries, commencing with the mur-
</p>
<p>der of Sir Charles Astlcy. (Mr. O'Connell, cor-
</p>
<p>recting the witness, ' Askell,') Sir Charles Askell,
</p>
<p>and ending with the little drum-boy."
</p>
<p>Now turn to where he announces the meetings he
</p>
<p>has fixed to come off, and read  " I will be at Kil-
</p>
<p>kenuy, on the 8th of June ; at Mallow, on the 1 1th ;
</p>
<p>at Murroe or Abingdon, on the 13th ; at Eunis, on
</p>
<p>the 15th ; at Athlone, on the 18th ; at Enniskillen,

<p>on the 21st. (Mr. O'Connell, oh. oh, and laugh-

<p>ment reporter speaking across the table to Mr.
</p>
<p>Brewster.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice pointed down to where Mr.
</p>
<p>Edwards was sitting, and said the disturhance came
</p>
<p>from that place.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, who was sitting next to Mr. Ed-
</p>
<p>wards, got up and denied that it came from liira.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbou said tliat many persons came there
</p>
<p>from curiosity, and if they could not hold their
</p>
<p>tongues they ought to remain at home.
</p>
<p>Ml-. Brewster  Look to page 12; do you find
</p>
<p>that Mr. Ray did anything at that meeting ? Yes,
</p>
<p>he handed in several sums of money ; I find in page
</p>
<p>13, that Dr. Gray gaTe in contributions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  Look to page 3, read the contents,
</p>
<p>and read slowly if you can.
</p>
<p>A Juror  Hold up your head, sir, and raise your
</p>
<p>voice.
</p>
<p>The witness then proceeded to read an extract
</p>
<p>from a speech of Mr. O'Connell's, in which he eulo-
</p>
<p>gised Mr. Murtagh, and promised to attend the
</p>
<p>meeting at Baltinglass on the 6th of August, which
</p>
<p>was his own birth-daj'. He then read a letter from
</p>
<p>the Right Rev. Dr. Coeu, Roman Catholic Bishop of
</p>
<p>Cloufert, enclosing Iiis subscription to the associa-
</p>
<p>tion. On tlie same day Mr. Barrett handed in
</p>
<p>money from a Protestant gentleman of the north of
</p>
<p>Ireland.
</p>
<p>The witness then read another extract from a
</p>
<p>speech of Mr. O'Coanell's at the same meeting. In
</p>
<p>that speech Mr. O'Connell alluded to the necessity
</p>
<p>of attending to the municipal elections, and said
</p>
<p>that the Tories had refused to pay the borough rate.
</p>
<p>He also said that Lord Brougham had been inquir-

<p>ing how the money received at the association was
</p>
<p>disposed of; but if Lord Brougham chose to sub-
</p>
<p>scribe his pound he would be enlightened on that
</p>
<p>point  that is, if tliey would receive the subscrip-
</p>
<p>tion of such a man. They had invested 6000/. in
</p>
<p>the funds already : they intended to invest 4000'.
</p>
<p>more, and 1000?. had been advanced for the build-
</p>
<p>ing of the Conciliation Hall.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  Look to page 12 ; do you see an
</p>
<p>entry of any money handed in by Mr. Ray ? Yes ;
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray handed in subscriptions from difiereut
</p>
<p>parts of England and Scotland (the -witness enume-
</p>
<p>rated them) ; Dr. Gray liandod in money on tlie
</p>
<p>same day, and stated that the Mai-quis of Down-
</p>
<p>shire had interfered to prevent his tenantry becom-
</p>
<p>ing repealers.
</p>
<p>Look to your notes of the meeting on the 25th of
</p>
<p>July, page 2. I have them before me ; tlie secre-
</p>
<p>tary handed in money on tliat day ; in page 6, I see
</p>
<p>that Mr. O'Connell handed in money on the same
</p>
<p>day ; in page 8, I find that Mr. Duffy, of the Na-
</p>
<p>tion, handed in his subscription? in page 9, I find
</p>
<p>that Mr. Steele and Mr. John O'Connell handed in
</p>
<p>money.
</p>
<p>Look to page 6, and read the statement of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell with regard to the finance details ? Mi\
</p>
<p>O'Connell stated that tlie amount received from the
</p>
<p>4th of July, 1842, to tlie corresponding quarter in
</p>
<p>1843, was 15,000/.
</p>
<p>We will now go to the 14th day of August, as
</p>
<p>set out in the indictment ; look at page 2 of your
</p>
<p>manuscript; who appeared to have been at that
</p>
<p>meeting of the association ? Mr. Ray, Dr. Gray,

<p>and Mr. O'Connell.

<p>166
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Look to page 7, and see if Mr. Eay did anything ?
</p>
<p>He read a letter enclosing a bill on Mr. Eothscliild
</p>
<p>for 126/.
</p>
<p>Did Mr. J. O'Connell read a letter? Yes; he
</p>
<p>read a letter from Cincinnati, enclosing 113/.
</p>
<p>Did Mr. O'Connell say anything at that meeting ?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>[The witness then read some observations made by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell with respect to the order on Roths-
</p>
<p>child, the arbitration courts, and a letter received
</p>
<p>from Mr. Barry, of Mallow.]
</p>
<p>Look to the meeting of the 29th of August, at
</p>
<p>page 3 and 5, and say who were present at it ? Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Ray, and Mr. J. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Read the observations of Mr. O'Connell at that
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>The witness commenced to read an abstract of the
</p>
<p>speech read by Mr. Ross yesterday, when
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton asked whether it was ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to read the speech over again ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said that he only wanted to have
</p>
<p>the last page read ; but the other side might require
</p>
<p>to have the entire read.
</p>
<p>The witness then read some observations made by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, to the effect that Ireland had many
</p>
<p>grievances to complain of. She was accused of being
</p>
<p>discontented, and she was so. It was said she was
</p>
<p>disaffected ; but he flung back the accusation by say-
</p>
<p>ing it was as false as hell. She was not disaffected,
</p>
<p>but discontented. There should be no outbreak in
</p>
<p>his life-time ; but when he was dead it would not
</p>
<p>be an unnatural or unadvisable result.
</p>
<p>The expression " unadvisable result" seemed to
</p>
<p>come with surprise upon counsel for the crown, the

<p>Solicitor-General, and Mr. Brewster again asking
</p>
<p>him what result ? To which the witness still re-
</p>
<p>plied an unadvisable result.
</p>
<p>Mr.. O'Connell  I never said anytliing of the kind.
</p>
<p>[In the report read by Mr. Ross yesterday, the
</p>
<p>words were, we believe, " unavoidable result."]
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  Can you say how any of those ob-
</p>
<p>servations were received ? No.
</p>
<p>Look to page 1 of the report of the meeting of
</p>
<p>the 4tli of September, and which of the traversers
</p>
<p>were there? Mr. Bay, Mr. Steele, and John
</p>
<p>O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Go to page 7, and see if Mr. O'Connell did any-
</p>
<p>thing' He handed in sums of money from Ros-
</p>
<p>common, Swanlinbar, Belfast, Adelaide, New York,
</p>
<p>Boston, and other places.
</p>
<p>Did Mr. Ray make any observations ? He recom-
</p>
<p>mended the " Spirit of the Nation" to be circulated
</p>
<p>amongst the people, instead of the trash they were in
</p>
<p>the habit of reading.
</p>
<p>As the witness read the passage very indistinctly,
</p>
<p>he was ordered to read it over again.
</p>
<p>Now go to page 16, and see if Mr. O'Cormell said
</p>
<p>anything about another meeting to be held ? Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell said that there would be a meeting in
</p>
<p>Loughrea, where three or four hundred thousand
</p>
<p>people would be gathered together, and where there
</p>
<p>would be no breach of the peace if the sub-inspector
</p>
<p>of police would only allow him to have 200 men,
</p>
<p>hardy repealers, to act as policemen, under the com-
</p>
<p>mand of the sub-inspector.
</p>
<p>Now go to the 10th September, and look at page
</p>
<p>1. Which of the traversers were present ? Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, and Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINATION OF ME. JOHN JACKSON.
</p>
<p>187
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster- It was the middle of a page, not
</p>
<p>the middle of a speech. The passage was the refer-
</p>
<p>ence made to the distribution of the " Spirit of the
</p>
<p>Nation" by Mr. Kay.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  On this occasion Mr. O'Connell ap-
</p>
<p>pears to hare made several speeches, and when he
</p>
<p>called for any of them to be read, he called for the
</p>
<p>whole. In this particular case nothing had been
</p>
<p>heard of the speech beyond the announcement of the
</p>
<p>speech at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  You have misunderstood Mi'.
</p>
<p>Brewster, Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside s.aid if they had half the sentence
</p>
<p>read they must have the whole.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  I shall not consider a single
</p>
<p>sentence of that speech as having been read ; it was
</p>
<p>not wanted, and the reading of it was merely a mis-
</p>
<p>take. He would agree that it would be quite unfair
</p>
<p>for the crown to give a garbled extract from a
</p>
<p>speech, and not give it entire.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  What your lordship has said is
</p>
<p>quite enough. Mr. Brewster asked a question about
</p>
<p>a speech of Mr. O'Connell's ; if he asked more than
</p>
<p>that, and wished to have any of it read, he must read
</p>
<p>the whole.
</p>
<p>Was there any body else present at the meeting
</p>
<p>of the 28th of September ? Look to the last page
</p>
<p>and tell me. Mr. Steele was there also.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster (to the Clerk of the Crown)  Hand
</p>
<p>me the witness's notes of the 3rd of October.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown handed over the document.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster (to witness)  Look to page 1, and
</p>
<p>try do you find there any other of the traversers ?
</p>
<p>Yes ; Mr. O'Connell.

<p>Look at page 4 ? Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>Look at page 5 ? Mr. Duffy, of the Nation.
</p>
<p>Look to page 6 ? Mr. Bay and Mr. J. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Look to page 7 ? Dr. Gray and the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  Then it appears that all the tra-
</p>
<p>versers were present except Mr. Barrett ? My lords,
</p>
<p>as Mr. Hughes has already read out his entire report
</p>
<p>of the proceedings of that meeting, I do not think it
</p>
<p>necessary to trouble the court by a further reference
</p>
<p>to the witness's report of Mr. O'Connell's speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. ritzgibbon begged leave most emphatically to
</p>
<p>protest against the learned counsel indulging in any
</p>
<p>such remarks as those which had now fallen from
</p>
<p>him. If Mr. Brewster intended not to ask his wit-
</p>
<p>ness any further questions, he might rest satisfied
</p>
<p>with his own determination to that effect, without
</p>
<p>troubling their lordships with what he did not pur-
</p>
<p>pose doing. Such a course was wholly unnecessary.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  But, Mr. Fitzgibbon, the court has
</p>
<p>a right to receive for their own satisfaction, if they
</p>
<p>think fit, such information as has been offered by
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon_My lords, I most respectfully
</p>
<p>maintain, that Mr. Brewster has no right whatever
</p>
<p>to state to the court in the hearing of the jui-y the
</p>
<p>reasons which have induced him to adopt such or
</p>
<p>such a course.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, Q.C Besides, such a proceeding leads
</p>
<p>to the inference that the present witness may be in a
</p>
<p>position to corroborate Mr. Hughes's notes, whereas,
</p>
<p>there is no direct evidence whatever to prove any-
</p>
<p>thing of the kind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  I only wanted to avoid the impu-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Then, I suppose, that hy embellishments you mesrn
</p>
<p>something in the report which, in point of fact, did
</p>
<p>not occur? Decidedly.
</p>
<p>Something in fact that was not true? Yes.
</p>
<p>I may go the length of saying, I suppose, that lialf
</p>
<p>of them were fictions ? There were many fictions in
</p>
<p>iny sketches.
</p>
<p>And that, I suppose, is what you call reporting
</p>
<p>after a manner (laughter)? Yes, precisely so
</p>
<p>(laughter).
</p>
<p>Then you commenced your career as a reporter hy
</p>
<p>vending falsehoods (laughter)? No, not exactly
</p>
<p>that ; I wrote on the same principle and in the same
</p>
<p>style as a reporter to a magazine.
</p>
<p>Have you contributed to magazines ? I have done
</p>
<p>so a little.
</p>
<p>And your magazine articles are embellished after
</p>
<p>the same fashion? My magazine articles were
</p>
<p>tales of imagination (laughter.)
</p>
<p>Are you a bit of a poet ? Indeed a very large lit
</p>
<p>of a poet. (The witness was remarkably tall.)
</p>
<p>Are you what is called in the county Clare a poel-
</p>
<p>asther (laughter) ? You may, if you lilce, apply that
</p>
<p>appellation to me, for I do not mean to say I am a
</p>
<p>poet.
</p>
<p>Have you contributed articles in verse to any pub-
</p>
<p>lication ? Yes, I have.
</p>
<p>Did you ever contribute to the Nation ? Never.
</p>
<p>To what papers were you in the habit of sending
</p>
<p>verses ? To the Limerick papers I have named.
</p>
<p>And your poetry, I am to suppose, bore some con-
</p>
<p>formity to the principles of the paper to which you
</p>
<p>sent it? In nine cases out of ten such was not the
</p>
<p>fact.

</p>
<p>But you admit that in the 10th case it might,
</p>
<p>perhaps, be the fact? It might, perhaps.
</p>
<p>Were the reports you sent to the newspapers simi-
</p>
<p>lar to your contributions to the magazines? No,
</p>
<p>they were not.
</p>
<p>To what magazines do you contribute ? Tliere
</p>
<p>was a sketch of mine some time since in the Univer-
</p>
<p>iity Magazine. It was a tale of fiction.
</p>
<p>Yes, but was it not intended to pass for true?
</p>
<p>Yes, with those who would be fools enough to believe
</p>
<p>it true (loud laughter).
</p>
<p>Was it not intended by those reports to convey
</p>
<p>an accurate account of what passed at the Kilrush
</p>
<p>petty sessions? Some of what was published did
</p>
<p>occur there.
</p>
<p>You intended they should all appear in the news-
</p>
<p>papers as true ? Yes.
</p>
<p>And yet they were not true ? Some of them were.
</p>
<p>When did you cease reporting at Kilrush ? This
</p>
<p>month two years I came up here.
</p>
<p>How did you propose to live in Dublin ? I got a
</p>
<p>letter from the proprietors of the Morning Herald,
</p>
<p>asking me to come up here as their Irish correspon-
</p>
<p>dent.
</p>
<p>Who was at Kilrush that introduced you to the
</p>
<p>notice of the proprietor of the Morning Herald ? I
</p>
<p>met a relation of the proprietor of the Limerick Star,
</p>
<p>in Kilrush, Mr. Griffin ; he asked me if I was not the
</p>
<p>author of those sketches in the newspapers of the
</p>
<p>Kilrush petty sessions, and I said I was, and then
</p>
<p>he said that the proprietor of the Morning Herald
</p>
<p>expressed a wish that I should send some of them to
</p>
<p>that paper, which I did, and then I came to Dublin
</p>
<p>to be their correspondent.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINATION OF MR. JOHN JACKSON,
</p>
<p>189
</p>
<p>Was that the first time you were in liis office ? It
</p>
<p>was the first time I ever saw him to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Whose initials are those on that paper ? Mine.
</p>
<p>When and where did you write them ? In Mr.
</p>
<p>Kemmis's ofiice a few days after I was called on by
</p>
<p>the proprietor to do so.
</p>
<p>But were you in communication with Mr. Kem-
</p>
<p>mis before that ? No.
</p>
<p>Did you expect that communieationfrom Mr. Kem-
</p>
<p>mis to attend at his office ? Upon my oath I did not.
</p>
<p>When did you begin to attend the association
</p>
<p>meetings ? About eight or nine months ago.
</p>
<p>For the first time ? 1 was off and on there before.
</p>
<p>Were you a Repealer? No.
</p>
<p>Did you: pay a sliilling going in at the door ? I
</p>
<p>did the first time I went in.
</p>
<p>Afterwards you went in free  you went in as a
</p>
<p>reporter ? I did.
</p>
<p>Were the accounts of the proceedings you sent
</p>
<p>over from your own notes ? Sometimes they were,
</p>
<p>and sometimes borrowed from the notes of the man
</p>
<p>near me, perhaps.
</p>
<p>Were they borrowed from the notes of the man
</p>
<p>near you ? Very frequently they were ; I copied
</p>
<p>them from the slips of the man next me.
</p>
<p>Was that a short-hand writer ? Sometimes he was,
</p>
<p>and sometimes not; 1 gave the substance of what he
</p>
<p>had written out of course ; I could not copy short-
</p>
<p>hand notes, not being a short-hand writer myself.
</p>
<p>Used you ever to vary the language when you
</p>
<p>copied from the manuscript of the man next you ?
</p>
<p>I used.
</p>
<p>In order that it should not have the appearance of
</p>
<p>being a copy of what he transcribed? Precisely.

</p>
<p>And am I to understand that that was done to
</p>
<p>prevent the appearance, to your own proprietors,
</p>
<p>that you had merely copied what another man had
</p>
<p>transcribed ? Exactly.
</p>
<p>And those are the notes you have been reading
</p>
<p>here to-day ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Look to those notes that you have read, and se-
</p>
<p>lect out of them any one piece of paper which you
</p>
<p>will swear upon solemn oath contains what was
</p>
<p>taken down by you from the lips of the man repre-
</p>
<p>sented in it to have spoken ? Upon my solemn oath
</p>
<p>this paper (holding up one of his sheets of manu-
</p>
<p>script) contains the substance of what Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell said.
</p>
<p>Will you swear those were his words? To the
</p>
<p>best of my belief it is the substance of what he said.
</p>
<p>I never attempted to give his exact words.
</p>
<p>Now, attend to me. On your oath did you write
</p>
<p>what is upon that slip of paper while Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell was speaking ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Upon your oath was that written down upon that
</p>
<p>piece of paper from the lips of Mr. O'Connell while
</p>
<p>he was speaking it ? Yes, occasionally taking a
</p>
<p>note, and catching the leading topics in his discourse.
</p>
<p>I ask you to fix upon any one of the pieces of
</p>
<p>paper you have in your hand, that you will posi-
</p>
<p>tively swear, not that you believe, was written while
</p>
<p>the speaker was speaking ? To the best of my recol-
</p>
<p>lection this (meaning one of his slips) was ; but I
</p>
<p>cannot be positive.
</p>
<p>Then you are not positive ? No.
</p>
<p>What is the date of that slip ? The 30th of May.
</p>
<p>Then you are not positive as to that ? Not very.

<p>. Are you positive at all that that piece of paper

</p>
<p>Mr. Pitzgibbon I don't read from the paper at
</p>
<p>all. I'll read from mj brief now, I tell you. (Loud
</p>
<p>laughter.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  If you offer the newspaper in evi-
</p>
<p>dence I will not object to it, and then you may exa-
</p>
<p>mine him as to it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Here is my brief, will you have
</p>
<p>it in evidence ? (Great laughter.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  It is notcompetent for you to read
</p>
<p>from your brief or any other document, and then
</p>
<p>ask the witness if what is read agrees with notes he
</p>
<p>has taken. I say it is not competent to do so unless
</p>
<p>you put the document in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I will take up this paper, and
</p>
<p>see if 1 don't read a report of every word the wit-
</p>
<p>ness says he sent to the paper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  But that is what I object to.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton  Why go on to prove what you
</p>
<p>have such a perfect transcript of?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon The course I am taking is infi-
</p>
<p>nitely more fair to the witness than the course al-
</p>
<p>luded to on the other side ; it is the only fair and
</p>
<p>legal course which I am at present adopting; if I did
</p>
<p>not take this course, I would be stopped from read-
</p>
<p>ing the document if I did not examine the witness
</p>
<p>as to the fact before he left the table. In the paper
</p>
<p>of the next morning, I find a verbatim report of
</p>
<p>what the witness says he sent to London, and if I
</p>
<p>did not ask him about that I would have been stopped
</p>
<p>from reading it, unless I asked the man about it
</p>
<p>Tvhen I had liim on the table. Here is a man who
</p>
<p>comes on the table to tell the jury that he is a re-
</p>
<p>porter for a newspaper, and as such attended tlie

<p>spoke. I will show he is not a reporter, and that
</p>
<p>he was incapable of taking reports where he says he
</p>
<p>did, and that what he asserts is false. I want to
</p>
<p>show what he says is absolutely and morally false,
</p>
<p>and a fabrication from beginning to end, and that he
</p>
<p>is now speaking to the jury what is false, when he
</p>
<p>tells them that the documents which he holds in his
</p>
<p>hand were written by him at the meetings. He came
</p>
<p>here falsely representing to the jury that fact. He
</p>
<p>did not take a note at those meetings, nor had he
</p>
<p>the ability of taking notes, and, therefore, I want
</p>
<p>to show that what he did do was copied verbatim
</p>
<p>from the morning papers of the next day, and sent
</p>
<p>off by him, although he tells the jury he wrote the
</p>
<p>pieces of paper at the meetings.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton  I see your object is very clear.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Mr. Fitzgibbon, am I to under-
</p>
<p>stand that you intend to give the paper in evidence ?
</p>
<p>Mr, Fitzgibbon  No, I do not.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Then I feel great difficulty in
</p>
<p>that case of letting in this sort of examination.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster If he puts in the newspaper as evi-
</p>
<p>dence I will withdraw my objection, but unless he
</p>
<p>does so I must press it. Mr. Fitzgibbon may tell
</p>
<p>me he will not read from the paper but from his brief,
</p>
<p>and I object to that also, for how am I to know but
</p>
<p>that brief might be a copy of what this gentleman
</p>
<p>sent to the A/ornin^ //eraW. (Laughter.) Let him
</p>
<p>put in the newspaper as evidence, and I will with-
</p>
<p>draw the objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I am here at present to but
</p>
<p>no, I will get it in another form. Come, sh-, turn

</p>
<p>What hour of the day did you go to the meeting ?
</p>
<p>I don't know exactly.
</p>
<p>Who was on his legs when you entered the room?
</p>
<p>I don't know.
</p>
<p>Did you not offer awhile ago to tell me ? Was
</p>
<p>any one in the room when you went in ? Of course
</p>
<p>there were.
</p>
<p>When you entered the room was it empty or full ?
</p>
<p>I never went into the room but people were in it.
</p>
<p>Can you tell me whether it was morning, noon,
</p>
<p>or night when you entered it ? It was about mid-
</p>
<p>day.
</p>
<p>Did you hear the whole of Jlr. O'Counell s speech ?
</p>
<p>I did not hear the whole of it.
</p>
<p>You say you went there about twelve or one
</p>
<p>o'clock ? Yes, to the best of my recollection.
</p>
<p>And you swear you heard Mr. O'Connell speak
</p>
<p>there ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Will you swear that Mr. O'Connell was at the
</p>
<p>meeting at two o'clock ? He came in whilst I was
</p>
<p>there according to my note.
</p>
<p>Do you mean according to your note rerbatim, or
</p>
<p>do you swear from your memory ? I either saw
</p>
<p>him enter while I was there, or he was there before
</p>

<p>Is that your answer, Mr. Reporter from Clare,
</p>
<p>with your face hardened by the Atlantic breeze ? I
</p>
<p>am not ashamed of the place I came from  the breeze
</p>
<p>has not hardened my face.
</p>
<p>Well, sir, with your face hardened by the Atlantic
</p>
<p>breeze
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  It is not material, but he did not
</p>
<p>say so.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  He has sworn it.

<p>Mr. Brewster  What he said was it had not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Do yoxi swear that the Atlantic
</p>
<p>breeze or something else has not hardened your face?
</p>
<p>1 told you it had not, and I'll prove before I leave
</p>
<p>the table, if allowed to explain, that nothing has
</p>
<p>hardened me.
</p>
<p>Turn to your notes of the 4th of September, and
</p>
<p>now mind not to lose sight of the question be-
</p>
<p>tween us, which is, that you are to prove that you
</p>
<p>are not a hardened man. Find for me the passage in
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's speech in which, according to your
</p>
<p>report, he said that no tumult would take place in
</p>
<p>his time ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  Mr. Fitzgibbon is assuming that
</p>
<p>the witness said O'Connell said so.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I am interrogating him gene-
</p>
<p>rally, and I have a right to put the question in ray
</p>
<p>own shape.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon referred the witness to his notes
</p>
<p>of proceedings on 4th September, to read Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech, with the word " unadvisable."
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster It is not 4th September, but 29th
</p>
<p>August.
</p>
<p>Witness then read Mr. O'Connell's speech of the
</p>
<p>29th August, with reference to the proceedings in
</p>
<p>parliament during the session then closed (already
</p>
<p>given). The repeal of the union should be carried;
</p>
<p>the union was brought about by force, fraud, and
</p>
<p>perjury ; here the honourable gentleman went into
</p>
<p>a detail of all the advantages to Ireland
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon:  This is your own commentary ?
</p>
<p>Witness  It is ; he went on to state the prosperity
</p>
<p>of the country before the union  referred to the
</p>
<p>work published by Mr. Driscoll, and read various
</p>

</p>
<p>as in battle tlie Duke of Wellington and Napoleon
</p>
<p>would be mentioned (a laugh). They were the
</p>
<p>leaders, otherwise it would be Hamlet with the part of
</p>
<p>Hamlet left out (laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Oh, I see you know how to play
</p>
<p>your part (laughter).
</p>
<p>Why take a note of those three persons being there
</p>
<p>on that day ? Because they were the principal per-
</p>
<p>sona.
</p>
<p>Did Mr. John O'Conncll make use of any obser-
</p>
<p>vations ? Yes.
</p>
<p>How long did Mr. O'Connell speak ? I cannot re-
</p>
<p>member. It might be an hour or half an hour. It
</p>
<p>was rather a long speech.
</p>
<p>Was it the only speech made ? It was the only
</p>
<p>speech made. If there were any others I did not
</p>
<p>givethem.
</p>
<p>Casual obserx'ations might have been made ? I do
</p>
<p>not think there was any speech but Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>that day. All the others were only short observa-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>And you read the speech of the day in three or
</p>
<p>four minutes ? Yes ; I never took a verbatim re-
</p>
<p>port.
</p>
<p>Then this was not a verbatim report? Ko, it
</p>
<p>was not.
</p>
<p>Then you cannot swear to the words, " This
</p>
<p>would not be an unnatural or unadvisable result V"
</p>
<p>To the best of my belief these were the words. I
</p>
<p>can only say to the best of my belief they were the
</p>
<p>words.
</p>
<p>How far were you from Mr. O'Connell ? As far
</p>
<p>as from here to the corner of the court. I was so
</p>
<p>near him all the time, and I never left the room.

<p>How did you enter ? Did you pay a shilling at
</p>
<p>the door? No; the porters recognised me as a re-
</p>
<p>porter.
</p>
<p>Did you look at any gentleman's slip that day ?
</p>
<p>1 cannot say whether I did or not.
</p>
<p>Were there any short-hand reporters there that
</p>
<p>day ? I imagine they wrote short-hand.
</p>
<p>And is that an answer to my question ? I believe
</p>
<p>I saw persons who wrote short-hand there.
</p>
<p>Which do you think the practical short-hand re-
</p>
<p>porters or you gave the most faithful report of
</p>
<p>what Mr. O'Connell said that day ? The short-hand

<p>writers, certainly. I never undertook to give a

<p>verbatim report of what Mr. O'Connell said.

<p>as I am concerned.

</p>
<p>Mr. AVhiteside Now, Jlr. Jackson, draw upon
</p>
<p>your memory and not upon your imagination for
</p>
<p>your facts. Was Mr. Duffy at the association on
</p>
<p>the 6th of July ? I cannot say without referring to
</p>
<p>my notes.
</p>
<p>Can you swear you saw him on the 25th of July ?
</p>
<p>I cannot without referring to my notes.
</p>
<p>You sometimes copied from the slips of some other
</p>
<p>reporter, and sometimes from the morning journals
</p>
<p>of next day ? I did.
</p>
<p>The materials of your knowledge were sometimes

<p>taken from the inorning journals and from the slips
</p>
<p>of others then ? Yes.
</p>
<p>You have a taste for eloquence ? Not the slightest

</p>
<p>the people were discontented, but not disaffected ?
</p>
<p>Yes.
</p>
<p>And that the people were loyally disposed to the
</p>
<p>Queen ? He said so.
</p>
<p>And that they were loyal to her person ? He did.
</p>
<p>Did he not also speak of the French constitution
</p>
<p>and of Louis Philippe ? He did  more than once.
</p>
<p>He spoke sharply I believe of the French and
</p>
<p>their systems of government and education ? He
</p>
<p>did so.
</p>
<p>And very right. He spoke too of other things ;
</p>
<p>did he not ? He spoke strongly of their constitu-
</p>
<p>tion because their house of lords was a mockery ?
</p>
<p>He did so speak of it on those grounds.
</p>
<p>Did he not say that their university taught infi-
</p>
<p>delity ? He did.
</p>
<p>Well, there was no harm in that. One thing
</p>
<p>more about the Nation. Do you not remember Jlr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell distinctly saying that he repudiated any
</p>
<p>newspaper being the organ of the association, and
</p>
<p>that he particularly repudiated the Nation ? I heard
</p>
<p>him say so ; I am almost certain of it.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect the day when the plan for the
</p>
<p>renewed action of the Irish parliament was pro-
</p>
<p>posed ; did he not say this on that occasion ? I
</p>
<p>have heard those sentiments uttered by him.
</p>
<p>I suppose in sending your sketches to the Herald
</p>
<p>you seasoned them (laughter) according to the pa-
</p>

<p>them amusing (laughter).
</p>
<p>Oh ! I understand. You made them spicy (great
</p>
<p>laughter) to make them go down ? Yes.

<p>The Herald has changed hands lately ; has it not?

<p>It has.
</p>
<p>Was it since it changed hands that you received
</p>
<p>directions to verify your writing at the Crown So-
</p>
<p>licitor's ? It was a few days before.
</p>
<p>Did you not hear Mr. O'Connell say that he would
</p>
<p>not be held responsible, or the association either,
</p>
<p>for anything that might appear in the papers ? I
</p>
<p>heard him say that. Witness then said he wished
</p>
<p>to make an explanation, aud was proceeding to ad-
</p>
<p>dress the court, when
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbou said he objected to the witness
</p>
<p>making any explanation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson, however, was allowed to e.xplain,
</p>
<p>and said that he wished it to go forth to the world
</p>
<p>that these letters and documents were procured
</p>
<p>from the proprietors of the Momivg Herald, and
</p>
<p>placed in the hands of the crown solicitors unknown
</p>
<p>to him. The first information he got of it was a
</p>
<p>communication that he was required to attend at
</p>
<p>the solicitors' office, to verify his manuscript.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Well, only take care what you
</p>
<p>write in future to the Morning Herald.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINED BY JIR. MOORE.
</p>
<p>Look to your notes of the 3d of October. I have
</p>
<p>them here.
</p>
<p>Did you take these notes on the day of the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and at the meeting ? Yes, I did.
</p>
<p>Do you know the Rev. Mr. Tierney ? I do not
</p>
<p>loiow Ills person.
</p>
<p>If I mistake not you expressly mentioned his
</p>
<p>name amongst the names of the persons who you
</p>
<p>swore were present at the meeting that day  did
</p>
<p>you not ? Look to page 14 of your notes. By a

<p>reference to my notes, at the page you state, I find

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>and they would have full copies of the reports read
</p>
<p>by their witnesses, from whicli they could cull and
</p>
<p>gather such extracts as suited their ow n purposes,
</p>
<p>whereas the counsel for the traversers would only
</p>
<p>have their recollection to depend upon for such pas-
</p>
<p>Sages as they deemed favourable to their clients.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that the crown could
</p>
<p>not think of granting the application, and the
</p>
<p>grounds on which they refused it were, that such a
</p>
<p>course had never been before adopted, and was ut-
</p>
<p>terly without precedent. Besides, he objected to
</p>
<p>such a proceeding, because he could not but re-
</p>
<p>member the course that had been already pursued
</p>
<p>with respect to one or two of the crown witnesses
</p>
<p>by the traversers ; and, although he did not antici-
</p>
<p>pate the repetition of such a course, he thought that
</p>
<p>the manner in which the witnesses had been treated
</p>
<p>furnished, in itself, sufficient reason why the request
</p>
<p>Bhould not be complied with. All the meetings with
</p>
<p>respect to which evidence had been given by tlie
</p>
<p>crown witnesses had been reported in the newspa-
</p>
<p>pers, and nothing was easier than fjr such of the
</p>
<p>traversers as were connected with the press to have
</p>
<p>produced their o\>n reporters, to test the accuracy
</p>
<p>of any documents that had been read in court. Un-
</p>
<p>der all the circumstances of the case, it was impos-
</p>
<p>sible for the crown to deviate from the ordinary
</p>
<p>course by giving copies of the documents.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  I feel I cannot call upon your lord-
</p>
<p>ships to make an order. I must rest satisfied v/ith
</p>
<p>what has been said by the crown.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon then rose and submitted that the
</p>
<p>whole of Mr. Jackson's evidence ought to be struck
</p>
<p>out. Mr. Jackson had been brought here as a wit-

<p>ness by the crown, but his reports were made up in
</p>
<p>k particular manner ; and, even on his own showing,
</p>
<p>he had no means on earth for testing their accuracy.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  But, Mr. Fitzgibbon, surely this
</p>
<p>is not the proper time for making such an ap-
</p>
<p>plication ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  What time can be better than
</p>
<p>the moment when the witness leaves the table?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Why, the witness has already been
</p>
<p>cross-examined by three gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Yes, and my grounds for making
</p>
<p>this application are based upon that very cross-
</p>
<p>esamination.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice I do not think we can now accede
</p>
<p>to that proposition. The matter is well worthy of
</p>
<p>consideration, but not at present.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin  I do not think it is in our power
</p>
<p>to strike out any witness's evidence.

<p>MR. JOHN BROWNE CALLED AND EXAMINED BY MR.
</p>
<p>HOLMES.
</p>
<p>He said he was a printer and stationer, residing
</p>
<p>at 36, Nassau-street, and did printing work for the
</p>
<p>loyal national repeal association ; he was employed
</p>
<p>by the association generally through Mr. Eay.
</p>
<p>Did you receive much money from time to time ?
</p>
<p>Idid.
</p>
<p>Mention how much, and he under the sum ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzj^ibbon objected to the question, and
</p>
<p>Submitted it would not be evidence against the
</p>
<p>traversers.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice Would it not be evidence
</p>
<p>against Mr. Ray ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon Let him be asked what sum Mr.
</p>
<p>Eay paid him.

</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Hear that question again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I am here fur Dr. Gray, and I
</p>
<p>insist on my riglit to be heard. Mr. Holmes lias
</p>
<p>asked the question, " Have you an entry there of
</p>
<p>that document?" Now, I object to that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  You have mistaken the
</p>
<p>question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I do not mistake the terms of the
</p>
<p>question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes  These young men think I am not
</p>
<p>able to stand out, and I am (laughter). See if
</p>
<p>you find any entry there (meaning in the aocouut-
</p>
<p>book) of work, and imyment for it?
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  Ask him if he has anything
</p>
<p>relative to ihat document ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes In his own handwriting ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  In any handwriting.
</p>
<p>Witness I see an entry in my own handwriting.
</p>
<p>Does that entry relate to the document in your
</p>
<p>hand ? Both the entry and the document relate to
</p>
<p>MuUaghmast, but that is the only relation between
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>You say you did print a document for MuUagh-
</p>
<p>mast ? Yes.
</p>
<p>For this association ? Yes, I was paid for it. (A
</p>
<p>document handed witnesf.) This is the document
</p>
<p>I printed for MuUaghmast ; I was paid for it ; I sup-
</p>
<p>pose I printed 2,0U0 of them ; MuUaghmast was
</p>
<p>what the newsp.apers called a "monster meeting;"
</p>
<p>I printed some documents for the intended Clontarf
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. WTiiteside  I object to this. If thereare any
</p>
<p>documents let them be produced. Have you any
</p>
<p>documents here ? Yes, I have.

<p>Mr. Holmes Did you bring a document here that
</p>
<p>you printed relative to the Clontarf meeting ? The
</p>
<p>witness, after searching a bundle of papers, said 
</p>
<p>No; I find I have not the document alluded to; I
</p>
<p>think I printed some documents for the Donny-
</p>
<p>brook meeting ; I have brought all the documents I
</p>
<p>have here in accordance with the subpoBua served on
</p>
<p>me; some of them were printed for tlie association;
</p>
<p>all I have here were printed for the association ; I
</p>
<p>was paid for them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holm?s  It was rather a good job  wasn't it?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I object to this (loud laughter).
</p>
<p>It is uot a fit question at all. It's a mighty witty
</p>
<p>observation, though, but has nothing to say to the
</p>
<p>case at all.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin It is uot a question at all  it is
</p>
<p>merely an observation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes  Well, Mr. Wliiteside, if I stopped
</p>
<p>you in asking questions that are not relevant to the
</p>
<p>case, I would never have done. You ask questions
</p>
<p>which have nothing to do with the case at all.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  True ; but that is on cross-exa-
</p>
<p>mination ; and you seem to forget that you are now
</p>
<p>on the direct examination for tlie crown (laughter).
</p>
<p>A document handed witness, headed the " Revi-
</p>
<p>sion of the jury list." I printed tliis, not for the
</p>
<p>association, but for Mr. Mahony ; I don't know if I
</p>
<p>was paid for it yet.
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes  Then hand it back to me.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside  Aye, that's the place it ought to
</p>
<p>be (laughter).

<p>I'HE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Any document already read
</p>
<p>we don't want to read again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  ^Hand up a list of the jiapers
</p>
<p>you mean to read.
</p>
<p>The papers were then handed to the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown, and he commenced reading a small pamphlet,
</p>
<p>entitled " Instructions for the Appointment of Re-
</p>
<p>peal Wardens." After a few moments,
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh interrupted liim, and addressed
</p>
<p>the court on behalf of Mr. Barrett. He said that
</p>
<p>the document then offered to be read was not proved
</p>
<p>to have been an act emanating from the association.
</p>
<p>It had not been proved that the act was moved at
</p>
<p>the association, or at any of tlie public meetings or
</p>
<p>banquets ; it was not adopted ; it had not been read
</p>
<p>at any of the meetings ; and it was then attempted
</p>
<p>to give it in evidence, merely because the secretary
</p>
<p>for the association had ordered it to be printed. The
</p>
<p>indictment, after charging the traversers generally,
</p>
<p>in the first count, with certain overt acts, afterwards
</p>
<p>enumerates them. The traversers had called upon
</p>
<p>the crown-solicitor for a bill of particulars which
</p>
<p>had been furnished, and it was a very full one.
</p>
<p>This bill of particulars, in addition to the overt acts
</p>
<p>charged in the first count of the indictment, stated
</p>
<p>that in support of the prosecution evidence would
</p>
<p>be given of the speeches made, the resolutions
</p>
<p>moved and adopted, the meetings and dinners whicli
</p>
<p>took place, and also entries of proceedings made by
</p>
<p>the defendants, or by their direction, and the man-
</p>
<p>ner and order in which the persons comprising these
</p>
<p>proceedings went there. It was clear, then, that
</p>
<p>the overt acts relied upon were the meetings and
</p>
<p>hanqnets, the speeches dehvered at them, and the

<p>reports of the proceedings and resolutions of these
</p>
<p>meetings which were published in the newspapers.
</p>
<p>The book oSered in evidence did not fall within the
</p>
<p>full and comprehensive words of the indictment, or
</p>
<p>of the bill of particulars. That book was not
</p>
<p>adopted at any meeting, nor was it read at any meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and therefore could not be given iu evidence.
</p>
<p>The bill of particulars was very fair and full, and
</p>
<p>showed that the overt acts intended to he relied on
</p>
<p>were the dinners and meetings, also the speeches
</p>
<p>delivered at, the resolutions adopted at, the acts
</p>
<p>done, and the documents read at each meeting and
</p>
<p>dinner.  that was to say, at the meetings of the
</p>
<p>Loyal National Repeal Association
</p>
<p>The counsel for the crown objected to going
</p>
<p>through the meetings again at length.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh, Q.C I do so in order to make no
</p>
<p>omission, and to show the wide range which the
</p>
<p>crown have taken ; they referred to an infinite vari-
</p>
<p>ety of meetings. There is now produced in evidence
</p>
<p>a book which, on the part of my client, Mr. Barrett,
</p>
<p>I object to. The evidence can only be such as con-
</p>
<p>sists of overt acts, oractsdoneby the traversers. Tliis
</p>
<p>does not come within the range of any of the classes
</p>
<p>of evidence which can be produced to sustain tlie
</p>
<p>prosecution. It does not come within the latitude
</p>
<p>of even the wide net spread by the indictment and
</p>
<p>the bill of particulars. The crown cannot travel out
</p>
<p>of the bill of particulars and the overt acts stated.
</p>
<p>In the case of the King i'. Hamilton, CaiTington and
</p>
<p>Payne, 454, the indictment was for conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>the court, on motion, held the traversers entitled to
</p>
<p>specific charges in writing to enable them to be pre-
</p>
<p>pared to meet them.

</p>
<p>evidence of those acts, and a bill of particulars was
</p>
<p>framed with a view of enabling them to prove other
</p>
<p>specific facts not in the indictment. They did not
</p>
<p>set forth in the face of the bill of particulars the
</p>
<p>issuing of repeal cards to members and diplomas to
</p>
<p>repeal wardens. These related to the general plan
</p>
<p>of the association, and it was never thought of to set
</p>
<p>forth those acts. The learned Attorney quoted
</p>
<p>Starlde, p. 1097, in proof of his allegation, that there
</p>
<p>was no necessity to describe this document in the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars. By tliis evidence they wanted
</p>
<p>to show the general features of the association.  to
</p>
<p>show the bond by which the members of the society
</p>
<p>were bomid together  what instructions the officers
</p>
<p>received, aiidacts connected with the constitution of
</p>
<p>the society, not contained in the bill of particulars.
</p>
<p>He apprehended the law on the subject was quite
</p>
<p>settled, and that it was unnecessary to set out the
</p>
<p>evidence from beginning to end. They had given
</p>
<p>that general information which was necessary to pre-
</p>
<p>vent surprise, and this was a document relating to
</p>
<p>the general constitution of the association, and was
</p>
<p>not an overt act at all. He hoped, therefore, the
</p>
<p>court would not judge differently in this case from
</p>
<p>any other, and would not allow the objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he appeared on the same side as
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh, and- he would offer very few obser-
</p>
<p>vations, indeed, upon the point of law. Wliat was
</p>
<p>the nature of the evidence offered and objected to ?
</p>
<p>The evidence was that Browne printed these docu-
</p>
<p>ments, and that he was paid for them by the secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the association. He was not aware that
</p>
<p>Browne knew anything farther than that. There
</p>
<p>was no evidence of the time or circumstances attend-

<p>ing the publication of them.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  They were printed during
</p>
<p>1843.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore knew that, but it was begging the
</p>
<p>question .to refer to the document itself for that fact.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Bm'ton  I think the question to be
</p>
<p>argued is whether the document is good in evidence,
</p>
<p>not being contained in the bill of particulars.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, Q.C., said it was so ; but he thought
</p>
<p>it right to explain the nature of the evidence. They
</p>
<p>were left in doubt as to the time of printing those
</p>
<p>documents, except in so far as they related to the
</p>
<p>year 1843  but if admitted, they might affect the
</p>
<p>traversers for something done antecedently, which
</p>
<p>would be unjust to them. In the first place, what
</p>
<p>was it proposed by the bill of particulars to do ? In
</p>
<p>addition to several other matters and things set
</p>
<p>forth in the first part of the indictment, it was in-
</p>
<p>tended to do so-and-so. In the first count of the
</p>
<p>indictment there were a great many overt acts
</p>
<p>alleged, consisting of meetings, speeches, and pub-
</p>
<p>lications, as set out in detaU most specifically as overt
</p>
<p>acts ; then in the bill of particulars furnished by the
</p>
<p>crown, they intended (it was stated) to give other
</p>
<p>matter as evidence. It was not pretended that any
</p>
<p>mention was made in any one of the overt acts set
</p>
<p>out in the first count of the indictment, or any other
</p>
<p>of the counts of the publication of the several docu-
</p>
<p>ments proposed to be read in evidence. There were
</p>
<p>three distinct grounds on which evidence was to be
</p>
<p>given. The dates, times, and matters relating to
</p>
<p>various proceedings. The evidence now proposed
</p>
<p>did not come within any of them, and unless the
</p>
<p>bill of particulars was to be treated as nought, he con-

</p>
<p>sion made by Mr. Justice Littledale in that case,
</p>
<p>which shower! the distinction taken by the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General to be tlie distinction always applicable
</p>
<p>to such cases, and the distinction which ought to
</p>
<p>rule the present case. What was the nature of the
</p>
<p>order made by Mr. Justice Littledale ? The party
</p>
<p>in that case was ordered to deliver a particular
</p>
<p>statement of the specified charge in writing, but not a
</p>
<p>particle of evidence was he called upon to give, but he
</p>
<p>was merely called upon to state the particulars of
</p>
<p>the charge. Again, he recollected the case of the
</p>
<p>King V. Hamilton. That was a charge of obtaining
</p>
<p>goods under false pretences, and the party applied
</p>
<p>for liberty to give evidence of a false pretence dif-
</p>
<p>ferent from any of the false pretences set out in the
</p>
<p>indiotmeiit. In this case there was a general comit,
</p>
<p>and he would suppose that tliis particular document
</p>
<p>was intended to be used in support of the general
</p>
<p>count. Tliey had evidence of repeal wardens being
</p>
<p>appointed on a particular day in this association.
</p>
<p>They had no evidence of any instructions given to
</p>
<p>those persons, and the question was, whether the
</p>
<p>instructions emanating, he took it for granted, from
</p>
<p>the association  whether tlie instructions here in
</p>
<p>print, and printed by order of the association, and
</p>
<p>paid for by the association, through their secretary,
</p>
<p>whether these instructions were admissible in evi-
</p>
<p>dence, in order to support the general count,
</p>
<p>making it tlie act of the a-ssociation to which he
</p>
<p>advei-ted, namely the appointment of repeal war-
</p>
<p>dens. Now, this document which he held in liis
</p>
<p>hand contained no new eliarge. If it did, and if the
</p>
<p>traversers had been able to establish that by the
</p>
<p>introduction of this document, a charge different

</p>
<p>from any stated on the face of this indictment,
</p>
<p>coupled with tlie bill of particulars, had been intro-
</p>
<p>duced, then he thought tlie objection ought to pre-
</p>
<p>vail ; but the question was, if this document opened
</p>
<p>a ditferent charge, or whether it was merely evi-
</p>
<p>dence in support of one of the charges already open-
</p>
<p>ed. It appeared to him to be quite germain to the
</p>
<p>matter here. Evidence liad been given of the ap-
</p>
<p>pointment of repeal wardens. It was important to
</p>
<p>show the nature and constitution of that body. If
</p>
<p>the appointment of repeal wardens be an act mate-
</p>
<p>rial for the consideration of the jury in this case, it
</p>
<p>was also material to know the duties of those repeal
</p>
<p>wardens; not for the purpose of making a new
</p>
<p>charge, but to sustain the charge that was on the
</p>
<p>face of the indictment. This was signed by one of
</p>
<p>the traversers ; it was an act of one of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers ; it was signed by Daniel O'Connell, chair-
</p>
<p>man of the committee, and printed by the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, of which he is a leading member, through
</p>
<p>the secretary, and paid for by the association,
</p>
<p>through the same secretary. Now, suppose there
</p>
<p>was no printed document before them, but that wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were brought up to prove that the gentleman,
</p>
<p>whose name was at the foot of it, had given parol
</p>
<p>instructions outside the Corn Exchange to tlie re-
</p>
<p>peal wardens, with reference to the duties they had
</p>
<p>to perform, would any person tell hira that those in-
</p>
<p>structions would not be evidence against the person
</p>
<p>who gave them ? It manifestly would be evidence,
</p>
<p>and if, as parol testimony, it would be evidence,
</p>
<p>then it would be evidence when given in sciiptis.
</p>
<p>It appeared to him to be clear evidence, unless the
</p>
<p>party had undertaken to limit himself, in his bill of

</p>
<p>secretary of any society were to go to a printer and
</p>
<p>direct liira to print a letter explanatory of a certain
</p>
<p>document, could it be held that such act of the se-
</p>
<p>cretary Avas to be evidence per se a<iainst all the
</p>
<p>members of the society ? If evidence had been ad-
</p>
<p>duced to show tliat the association ordered the card
</p>
<p>to be issued, and with it the letter of explanation,
</p>
<p>then indeed it might perhaps be contended that the
</p>
<p>document fell ivithiu the bill of particulars ; but no
</p>
<p>SQch evidence had been adduced, and he accord-
</p>
<p>ingly protested ayainst the document being received.
</p>
<p>It was not now receivable in evidence, and on the
</p>
<p>first ground of objection it should be excluded ;
</p>
<p>and he further submitted that because it was not
</p>
<p>specially adverted to in the bill of particulars, or in
</p>
<p>the overt acts stated in the declaration, it should not
</p>
<p>be received. They should enter into a wide sea of
</p>
<p>evidence indeed if every printed paper which one
</p>
<p>man issued or caused to be issued were admitted.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that he submitted that
</p>
<p>in this case the document in question should be read
</p>
<p>and received in evidence. It was quite unnecessary
</p>
<p>to repeat the arguments he used with respect to the
</p>
<p>former document, and the members of the court
</p>
<p>were of opinion that those arguments were well
</p>
<p>founded. This document wa.s not of itself relied
</p>
<p>upon as an overt act.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton Is there any evidenceof speeches
</p>
<p>or resolutions passed at the association in reference
</p>
<p>to this documentor letter of iilr. O'Callaghan's ?
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that there was in the

<p>bill of particulars reference made to one of the
</p>
<p>newspapers, the Naiion, in which that document was
</p>
<p>printed word for word and letter fur letter.

<p>Mr. M'Donogh  The publications in the Nation
</p>
<p>are not yet before the court.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said if reference was made
</p>
<p>to the bill of particulars, the Nation of a particular
</p>
<p>date would be found embraced, and every thing that
</p>
<p>was contained in it from beginning to end was of
</p>
<p>course part of the indictment, and therefore he re-
</p>
<p>lied on the former decision. That authority coidd
</p>
<p>not be controverted, and he would respectfully
</p>
<p>deny that on such a charge of conspiracy as the
</p>
<p>present it ever yet was heard of to reqtiire of the
</p>
<p>crown to furnish a list of their documents. Accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the law of conspiracy they might be called
</p>
<p>upon, if there were general grounds in their indict-
</p>
<p>ment, to furnish a bill of particulars, but it was
</p>
<p>never heard of that they were obliged to furnish a
</p>
<p>list of their documents or of their evidence ; more-
</p>
<p>over where the document was not to be relied on as
</p>
<p>an overt act in itself. The learned gentleman then
</p>
<p>piled the case of the King v. Watson, from the State
</p>
<p>Trials, in support of his argument.
</p>
<p>, Judge Perrin  What is the meaning of this re-
</p>
<p>ference to the bill of particulars ?
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  The meaning of it is, that the
</p>
<p>first count in the indictment contains an allegation
</p>
<p>of the publication of a certain newspaper in which
</p>
<p>the document is printed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  The indictment states that
</p>
<p>"in addition to several matters and things set out
</p>
<p>in the first count, it is intended to give evidence of
</p>
<p>resolutions passed, speeches made, acts done, and
</p>
<p>letters and other documents read at the meeting."
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Precisely. What are the
</p>

</p>
<p>count charging them as members of a confederacy with
</p>
<p>unlawful ohjects. 1 establish an act committed by one
</p>
<p>of these co-conspirators in furtherance of their com-
</p>
<p>mon object. It was an act of Mr. Eay, the secretary of
</p>
<p>the association, which actwas in itself evidence of the
</p>
<p>objects which the indictment said the confederates had
</p>
<p>in view, and was he to be told that this evidence,
</p>
<p>which was traced to one of the traversers, he was not
</p>
<p>at liberty to offer to the jury ? It was, in fact, the
</p>
<p>same question which had been argued a whUe ago.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  Did you give the card in
</p>
<p>evidence ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General  No, he did not, but he
</p>
<p>proposed to do so. He alleged the document was
</p>
<p>evidence of the objects of the association, and that if
</p>
<p>there had never been a card in existence, neverthe-
</p>
<p>less it was evidence per se. The learned gentleman
</p>
<p>then referred to the passage quoted from Mr. Phi-
</p>
<p>lips' book by the Attorney-General, respecting the
</p>
<p>rule of law on the subject, and also to the case of the
</p>
<p>King V. Watson, also referred to by the learned At-
</p>
<p>torney-General. He cited the case of the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of Thelwall, in which a document read by Thel-
</p>
<p>wall was admitted as evidence of an overt act. If the
</p>
<p>name of Ray were substituted for Thelwall the cases
</p>
<p>were precisely the same.
</p>
<p>The Gliief Justice said that when analysed the
</p>
<p>present question resolved itself into the same as tliat
</p>
<p>on which they had just decided. He did not see any
</p>
<p>ground of difference between the two cases. If there
</p>
<p>had been no bill of particulars furnished, could it
</p>
<p>have been alleged that the evidence in question
</p>
<p>could have been sustained in support of the special
</p>
<p>count of the indictment ? No man could for a mo-

<p>ment question but that it would have been admissible
</p>
<p>evidence under those circumstances, and inasmuch as
</p>
<p>the bill of particulars had been given only in respect
</p>
<p>of the general counts, he could not see why the pre-
</p>
<p>sent document should not be admitted as eridence
</p>
<p>in respect of the special count, which was in nowise
</p>
<p>affected by the bill of particulars. He was in favour,
</p>
<p>therefore, of receiving the document ; for without
</p>
<p>meaning to conjecture what might be the tendency of
</p>
<p>the evidence, whether for or against the traversers,
</p>
<p>he held that the right of the crown in this respect
</p>
<p>was quite independent of the bill of particulars. It
</p>
<p>could not be said that the evidence was a surprise on
</p>
<p>the traversers, for it came under the special count.
</p>
<p>Judge Burton and Judge Crampton signified their
</p>
<p>concurrence ia the judgment of the Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin also expressed his concurrence in the
</p>
<p>judgment. He was of opinion that on the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, as originally framed, this document was
</p>
<p>clearly admissible evidence. He admitted, however,
</p>
<p>that it did not come within the particulars specified
</p>
<p>in the bill of particulars, but it being understood that
</p>
<p>that bill related only to other counts in the declara-
</p>
<p>tion, it could not affect the rule with respect to the
</p>
<p>first count. The rule for granting a bill of parti-
</p>
<p>culars was this, that it was to be given in cases
</p>
<p>where the necessity for such a document arose out
</p>
<p>of want of definitiveness in the record, and the party
</p>
<p>had only himself to blame for not making the rule
</p>
<p>specify in the first instance to what extent the parti-
</p>
<p>culars were to go. It was upon those general grounds,
</p>
<p>and more specifically upon the ground that the bill of

<p>particulars did not affect this case, that he concurred

<p>THOMAS PACKER EXAMINED CT JIR. TBEEJIAN, Q.C.
</p>
<p>I am a lithographic artist, and came to this coun-
</p>
<p>try last March ; I lived in London before that; 1
</p>
<p>know Mr. Holbrooke, and was employed by him as
</p>
<p>a lithographic artist immediately after I came to this
</p>
<p>country ; I was employed in drawing sketclies from
</p>
<p>the scenery, and afterwards lithographing them on
</p>
<p>Btone, and was occupied in other business also ; I
</p>
<p>see these (two small cards handed to the witness)
</p>
<p>two cards ; they were printed from stone, but the
</p>
<p>original was engraved on copper by a person named
</p>
<p>James ; I can't say who struck these two cards off;
</p>
<p>saw several of these cards ininted ; there was a vast
</p>
<p>quantity of them printed in Mr. Holbrooke's place.

<p>Mr. Freeman (repeating the answers']  There was
</p>
<p>avast quantity of these printed in Mr. Holbrooke's
</p>
<p>place ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  "Don't repeat the witness's an-
</p>
<p>swer, let him reply for himself.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman  Where docs Mr. Holbrooke live?
</p>
<p>At No. 4, Crow-street ; I saw several thousands of
</p>
<p>these cards printed, but I can't say the exact num-
</p>
<p>ber; (another card banded to witness) this is a
</p>
<p>similar card to the other two cards ; it is printed
</p>
<p>from stone ; it is the same description of card that
</p>
<p>I saw in Holbrooke's place ; I see this card (a large
</p>
<p>card handed to witness).
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman The two first small cards which I
</p>
<p>handed the witness have been proved already, and
</p>
<p>the second one is of the same description.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Yes, yes, they were originally en-
</p>
<p>graven on copper and struck off from stone.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman  Look at the large card I have
</p>
<p>handed you, is it called a member's card ? Yes, it
</p>
<p>is ; I saw similar cards to this before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman (repeating the answer) He saw
</p>
<p>similar cards lo that before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  The answer was heard all over
</p>
<p>the court. I request you will not repeat the answers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman What sort of a card is this (the
</p>
<p>large card handed to witness) ? It is a member's card.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman (repeating the answer)  It is a mem-
</p>
<p>ber's card.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I tell you we all heard the an-
</p>
<p>swer. You 7nvst not repeat his answers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman  Oh, it's not important.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Then, that's an additional rea-
</p>
<p>son why you shall not repeat his replies. I submit,

<p>203
</p>
<p>an old French engraving, which I got from Mr.
</p>
<p>Geraghty, the bookseller ; Mr. Holbrooke brought
</p>
<p>him to me ; Mr. Holbrooke suggested tlie introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of Sarsfield ; I cannot say that Mr. Ray did ;
</p>
<p>the next likeness is one of Hugh O'Neill; it was
</p>
<p>drawn by me, I almost forget from what I copied
</p>
<p>it ; I think I composed it myself; the next likeness
</p>
<p>is that of Dathy ; I have been in the association ; I
</p>
<p>have seen Mr. Kay there.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman  Had you any conversation with
</p>
<p>him there about the alterations?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  He has already said that sug-
</p>
<p>gestions were given him by Mr. Kay.
</p>
<p>Witness  Not at the association, but, as I said
</p>
<p>before, he made suggestions ; I cannot charge my
</p>
<p>memory with the exact words he used.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman  Look at the harp and shield. Were
</p>
<p>there any alterations suggested there? Not in this
</p>
<p>card (the black one), but on the other; there were
</p>
<p>not many of these cards hthographed, for they sepa-
</p>
<p>rated by over etching ; an attempt was made to
</p>
<p>repair them ; I do not recollect which of the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation cards was first given ; recollects the time of
</p>
<p>designing the volunteers' card, it was about the be-
</p>
<p>ginning of 1813 ; the members' and the associates'
</p>
<p>card was about the same time ; the volunteer card
</p>
<p>was engraved some time later ; tliat was about
</p>
<p>March ; holds in his hand tlio repeal wardens' di-
</p>
<p>ploma ; it was designed by witness from materials
</p>
<p>furnished by Mr. Holbrooke ; the design commenced
</p>
<p>before the begiuning of 1843 ; it was not completed
</p>
<p>until after the beginning of that year; it was com-
</p>
<p>pleted before the volunteer card ; during the design
</p>
<p>witness saw Mr. Ray ; will not undertake to say he

<p>heard any observations from Jlr. Ray with respect
</p>
<p>to the diploma ; while it was in progress of engrav-
</p>
<p>ing Mr. Holbrooke brought several gentlemen to see
</p>
<p>it Mr. Davis, Mr. O'Callaghan, and Jlr. Ray ;
</p>
<p>knows Mr. Steele ; he used to come and see the
</p>
<p>cards ; cannot charge his memory which of them ;
</p>
<p>no one accompanied him ; on the occasions of his
</p>
<p>visits he principally directed his conversation to
</p>
<p>Mr. Holbrooke ; witness heard it ; it was quite irre-
</p>
<p>levant to the diploma.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  If so say nothing about it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman  It might be relevant to something
</p>
<p>else.
</p>
<p>Witness knows Mr. Duffy, of the Nation ; saw
</p>
<p>him in company with Mr. Davis at Mr. Holbroke's ;
</p>
<p>does not recollect seeing him with any one else ; saw
</p>
<p>them in the studio ; Mr. Duffy sat in a chair, and
</p>
<p>looked at the work in progress ; does not recollect
</p>
<p>him making any observation ; the time Mr. Steele
</p>
<p>came alone was about the middle of March, as wit-
</p>
<p>ness best recollects ; witness sketched Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's head on the volunteer card at the repeal asso-
</p>
<p>ciation ; that is the head of Mr. Daniel O'Conuell ;
</p>
<p>this was when the repeal volunteer card was in pro-
</p>
<p>gress ; saw Mr. John O'Conuell ; he was at the re-
</p>
<p>peal association near the table at which the chair-
</p>
<p>man sits ; did not see Mr. Ray tliere ; had seen him
</p>
<p>before ; thinks he saw Mr. O'Conuell and Mr. Ray
</p>
<p>together; could not say if Mr. John O'Conuell was
</p>
<p>with thera ; was at the repeal association very rarely,
</p>
<p>except on business ; his business was sketching ; went
</p>
<p>five or six times on that business ; don't remember
</p>
<p>seeing Mr. Dutfy there ; did not see Dr. Gray there ;
</p>
<p>thinks he would know him if he saw him.

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>suit of youi" own fancy exclusively ? It is partly
</p>
<p>wine and partly Mr. Holbrooke's ; I am a loyal sub-
</p>
<p>ject of her Majesty.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  You would not engrave anything
</p>
<p>injurious to her Majesty ? Not knowingly.
</p>
<p>Did you go to the Diuing-room or Examination
</p>
<p>Hall to take a likeness of Flood ? T did.
</p>
<p>In taking a likeness of Flood in the Examination
</p>
<p>or Dining-hall, you did not think you were doing
</p>
<p>anything inconsistent with your duty as a loyal
</p>
<p>subject ? No.
</p>
<p>Have you any idea of whom Flood was ? Tes, he
</p>
<p>was the cotemporary of Grattau.
</p>
<p>You saw, I think, Mr. Steele at Holbrooke's
</p>
<p>once and once only ? Yes ; I am not, however,
</p>
<p>aware whether or not it was on business ivholly ir-
</p>
<p>relevant to the present inquiry as to those cards ; I
</p>
<p>am not aware whetlier he came there about arrang-
</p>
<p>ing a lithograph drawing to be placed at the title
</p>
<p>page of some book of his; I remember to have seen
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray there ; I remember his looking over the
</p>
<p>premises, but I know not whether he came to visit
</p>
<p>certain machinery ; he viewed the premises, and
</p>
<p>and that is all I remember about his visit ; I am un-
</p>
<p>acquainted with Mr. Barrett; I never saw him
</p>
<p>that I remember ; my interview Avith Mi-. J. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell had reference only to taking his likeness ; I
</p>
<p>liave not seen Mr. Holbrooke since my return to
</p>
<p>Dublin ; came here from London on AVednesday
</p>
<p>evening ; up to that time I was in London, since
</p>
<p>August last; I believe Mr. Holbrooke to be in Dub-
</p>
<p>lin at present ; I went to London to carry on my
</p>
<p>profession.
</p>
<p>The witness retired.

<p>ISAAC GARDINER EXAMINED BY Mn. MARTLET.
</p>
<p>Mr. Martley  What is your profession ? I am a
</p>
<p>Avriting engraver.
</p>
<p>AVTiat countryman are j'ou? I am an English-
</p>
<p>man ; I came to this country last January ; 1 was
</p>
<p>in the employment of Mr. Holbrooke, as an en-
</p>
<p>graver, for nearly four months, from the middle of
</p>
<p>February to the end of June, 1843 ; it is my busi-
</p>
<p>ness to draw letters on stone.
</p>
<p>[Here cards of the association were handed to the
</p>
<p>witness. The associates' card, wliich is a small
</p>
<p>one ; the members' card, somewhat larger ; and the
</p>
<p>volunteers' card, the largest of the three.]
</p>
<p>Do you know any thing about those cards ? I
</p>
<p>engraved the lettering upon those (the members'
</p>
<p>and associates' cards) somewhere about March last ;
</p>
<p>I engraved the plate for the members' card first ;
</p>
<p>when it was brought to me it had the banners upon
</p>
<p>it ; my work upon the plate was tlie last that was
</p>
<p>done upon it ; Mr. Holbrooke gave it to do ; I do
</p>
<p>not know Mr. Kay, nor (looking round to identify
</p>
<p>the traversers) any of the traversers ; engraved the
</p>
<p>small card; the name "Ray" engraved upon it is
</p>
<p>supposed to be a/ac simile of his autograph ; (handed
</p>
<p>the volunteers' card) I designed the writing of that
</p>
<p>card ; I cannot say who engraved it ; I engraved
</p>
<p>the members' card first, then the associates', and
</p>
<p>next the diploma (the repeal wardens') ; I executed
</p>
<p>the writing on the centre of this diploma ; I see a
</p>
<p>stamp on the members' card ; it was not engrossed
</p>
<p>when these cards were originally printed ; I cannot
</p>
<p>say what quantity of them were struck off.
</p>
<p>[Here a coloured and uncoloured members' card
</p>
<p>were handed to the witness, and lie identified the

</p>
<p>During the whole of that period ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Hare you never seen that stamp alfixed to papers
</p>
<p>printed for the gorernment? I have not.
</p>
<p>When did you first see that stamp ? I cannot
</p>
<p>say.
</p>
<p>Will you venture to say tliat you did not see it
</p>
<p>five years ago ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Six years ago ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Will you swear you did not see it three years
</p>
<p>ago ? No.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Is it the die you are speaking of?
</p>
<p>Mr. Close  The die, my lord.
</p>
<p>You will not swear that you saw it as long ago as
</p>
<p>two years? No.
</p>
<p>Does any thing enahle you to fix the time. No.
</p>
<p>Will you venture to say that you did not see it
</p>
<p>before the year 1S43? I will not.
</p>
<p>How long is it since you say these papers were
</p>
<p>printed  within the last tlu-ee or four months?
</p>
<p>About that time.
</p>
<p>Upon your oath, did you not see that die and
</p>
<p>stamp before that ? I have never seen it.
</p>
<p>Did you ever see it affixed to any other paper ?
</p>
<p>No.
</p>
<p>To none whatever ? Not to my loiowledge.
</p>
<p>Will you swear that you have not? I will.

</p>
<p>Have you seen such cards ? I have, sir.
</p>
<p>Have you ever carried parcels of such cards fi-om
</p>
<p>Mr. Holbrooke, to any place ? I have.
</p>
<p>Were they made up in parcels ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you know how many each parcel contained ?
</p>
<p>I do not.
</p>
<p>Wliere did you bring them to? I brought them
</p>
<p>to the Corn Exchange.
</p>
<p>Wliere did you leave them ? I left them in the
</p>
<p>top of the house ; I don't know in whose office it
</p>
<p>was I left them ; I delivered them to two of the
</p>
<p>clerks ; I don't know their names.
</p>
<p>Do you know a person of the name of Quigly ? I
</p>
<p>have heard tell of him.

<p>Have you ever seen him ? Yes, I have seen him

<p>those cards to him.
</p>
<p>Do you know Mr. Ray ? I do not ; I do not even

<p>know his appearance.
</p>
<p>Look to the other documents and tell rae have

<p>you carried any of them to the Corn Exchange ? I

<p>might in parcels ; I never assisted in making them
</p>
<p>up in parcels.
</p>
<p>(The volunteer and members' cards were here
</p>
<p>handed up to ivitness.) I have seen such cards as
</p>
<p>those taken out of Mr. Holbrooke's to the Corn Ex-
</p>
<p>change. (The repeal wardens' diploma was here
</p>
<p>handed to witness.) I have seen documents such as

<p>that taken out of Mr. Holbrooke's and delivered at

</p>
<p>MB. John ulick m'namara, sworn and exa-
</p>
<p>mined BY MB. TOMB.
</p>
<p>I am a short-hand writer ; I attended a meeting
</p>
<p>that toolc place at Tiillamore on the Ifithof July
</p>
<p>last; I arrived tliere the evening before ; the meet-
</p>
<p>ing commenced some time before two o'clock ; I saw
</p>
<p>a great many people there ; as far as I saw they came
</p>
<p>there the same way as they would come to town on
</p>
<p>any other occasion, say on a market d.ay ; thei-e were
</p>
<p>great crowds at that meeting ; I took notes of what
</p>
<p>passed there, short-hand notes ; I transcribed these
</p>
<p>notes after with the exception of some few sentences ;
</p>
<p>my short-hand notes have been destroyed ; I have
</p>
<p>the transcript here ; I know two of the traversers,
</p>
<p>Mr. Daniel O'Connell and Mr. Steele ; I saw them
</p>
<p>there ; the Rev. Dr. O'Rafferty was chairman of that
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Do you mean to state that your
</p>
<p>transcript of the speeches, or whatever it was, is a
</p>
<p>correct and verbatim translation of what was on your
</p>
<p>notes ? Yes, with the exception I slated. I took
</p>
<p>notes of some few sentences which in transcribing I
</p>
<p>omitted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Then your short-hand notes would
</p>
<p>show certain portions of a speech taken down but
</p>
<p>not transcribed ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Is any portion of that which you
</p>
<p>call the transcript of your short-hand notes supplied

</p>
<p>from your memory ? No, except such words as are
</p>
<p>usually omitted by short-hand writers, the connect-
</p>
<p>ing parts.
</p>
<p>Then you mean to represent that there is no sub-
</p>
<p>stantive word in that report wliich was not taken
</p>
<p>down in your short-hand note? I do ; and that the
</p>
<p>sentences are completed from my short-hand notes,
</p>
<p>with the exception of the connecting words ; per-
</p>
<p>haps it is right I should mention that I did not take
</p>
<p>down all that passed at that meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb State what the Rev. Mr. O'Eafferty
</p>
<p>said on that occasion ?
</p>
<p>Witness proceeded to read the speech, the follow-
</p>
<p>ing being extracts from it :  Dr. (J'Kafferty said 
</p>
<p>" JTellow-countrymen and brother repealers, the re-
</p>
<p>generator and liberator of his country had arrived
</p>
<p>amongst them for the purpose of paying them a visit.
</p>
<p>The Liberator had come amongst them for the first
</p>
<p>time. It would not be saying too much for the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of that part of the country, when he stated that
</p>
<p>they would support that great man (O'Connell) in
</p>
<p>the struggle he was making for the regeneration of
</p>
<p>his native land ; they were too long trodden under
</p>
<p>foot by tlie Saxon. The great man who had come
</p>
<p>amongst them would address the meeting, and would
</p>
<p>tell them of the blessings that would result from tlie
</p>
<p>repeal of the union. It would bring blessings on
</p>
<p>the country, which Mr. O'Connell liimself only
</p>
<p>could tell them of." That is all I took of the speech.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Flanagan addressed the meeting also,
</p>
<p>but very shortly. The Rev. Mr. Spain spoke at
</p>
<p>that meeting. He said, " It was a glorious day for
</p>
<p>the King's County. They had, a few short months

<p>ago, another meeting in another part of the country,

</p>
<p>our constitutional rights, that we would hreak no
</p>
<p>law, but we would persevere, despite of threats, in
</p>
<p>our peaceable struggle. Tliis declaration liad its
</p>
<p>effect, and the idea of coercion was given up. Tlie
</p>
<p>Times newspaper announced the other day that the
</p>
<p>ministry liad spent a wliole ten hours deliberating
</p>
<p>upon the state of Ireland, that they had come to
</p>
<p>no conclusions with regard to her grievances, but
</p>
<p>that the Irish should be cut down ! But I announce
</p>
<p>my defiance : the people have broken no law, they
</p>
<p>have offended no man; but if tliey are attacked
</p>
<p>they will defend themselves. No breach of the
</p>
<p>peace shall be committed by the people of Ireland.
</p>
<p>They will give no excuse for the use offeree against
</p>
<p>them, and thus they will embarrass their enemies.
</p>
<p>If the government attempts to bring in a coercion
</p>
<p>bill, I will take my place in the house of commons,
</p>
<p>though much I dislike it, I will move amendment
</p>
<p>after amendment upon every clause of the bill, and
</p>
<p>I will keep them two years before they can pass it.
</p>
<p>This is my answer to their threat of a gagging
</p>
<p>bill. We only looked for equality when we sought
</p>
<p>for emancipation, and Peel said it should never be
</p>
<p>granted, yet he was the first to concede it. Eman-
</p>
<p>cipation only served the rich, but repeal will serve
</p>
<p>the poor, it will bring 300,000/. a year into this
</p>
<p>country alone. I call upon the Irish landlords to
</p>
<p>unite with me ; they will be benefited by repeal ;
</p>
<p>it will put an end to the uuhousing of the poor. In
</p>
<p>these results her affections were centered, yet her
</p>
<p>tears were disregarded, and despite her remon-
</p>
<p>strances the ruthless fiat went forth to pull down
</p>
<p>the house. There were wholesale murders on the
</p>

<p>astrous on the persons against whom they were per-
</p>
<p>petrated. All persons agree that something must
</p>
<p>be done. Why not do it at once ? I propose doing
</p>
<p>it by the repeal. Mr. Uobinsou has a plan of his
</p>
<p>own. I am for mine. My plan is that no landlord
</p>
<p>should receive rent unless he gives a lease. Like
</p>
<p>the payment of the clergy, no penny no paternoster,
</p>
<p>no lease no rent. Property has its rights, and shall
</p>
<p>continue to have them; it has also its duties, and
</p>
<p>must perform them. He cautioned the people
</p>
<p>against Uibbonism, and begged if any one sought
</p>
<p>to induce them to become liibbonmen, to deliver
</p>
<p>him up to justice. Let any one who will do so hold
</p>
<p>up his hand."
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  State what was done then? I
</p>
<p>have a mark here that every one did so.
</p>
<p>Witness in continuation Mr. O'ConneU proceed-
</p>
<p>ed: "I now have your pledge. Have I not teetotallers
</p>
<p>here ? If I want you I know I can get you. [Avoice,
</p>
<p>' the sooner the better.'] Once repeal was carried, all
</p>
<p>the roads would be repaired, all the court houses
</p>
<p>and bridewells  if there was any occasion for such
</p>
<p>places  would be built out of the consolidated fund.
</p>
<p>What was taxed as exciseable would be bought at
</p>
<p>one-fourth its present price. Repeal is the hope of
</p>
<p>Ireland. He alluded to the gentleness which springs
</p>
<p>from religious feelings. This enabled the women
</p>
<p>to mingle among them without fear. If it was ne-
</p>
<p>cessary for them to remain in the field until blood
</p>
<p>should flow, no general would remain more readily
</p>
<p>than he. He warned the meeting not to vote for
</p>
<p>a Tory, and related an anecdote told him by a
</p>
<p>friend, of people refusing to work with a man who
</p>
<p>would not be a repealer. The shout of repeal would

<p>THE miSH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Where were your short-hand notes taken ? Was
</p>
<p>it in a book or in slips ? In slips.
</p>
<p>Were they tied with thread or pinned ? No ;
</p>
<p>they were on scattered slips of paper.
</p>
<p>Did you undei-stand when you went to the meet-
</p>
<p>ing that you were to be paid ? Certainly.
</p>
<p>Had the price been agreed upon ? No.
</p>
<p>It was to be a quantum meruit. Do you understand
</p>
<p>that ? There was nothing at all said about it ; but
</p>
<p>I understood I was to be paid.
</p>
<p>Have you been in the habit of reporting for any
</p>
<p>paper? I reported for a Drogheda paper.
</p>
<p>When ? Something about a year before.
</p>
<p>Were j'ou connected with any paper as a reporter
</p>
<p>in the intermediate time ? I was not.
</p>
<p>Then you were out of practice for twelve months ?
</p>
<p>I was ; I was very much so, but not altogether.
</p>
<p>Did you not say that you were not reporting for
</p>
<p>twelve months ? I used to take notes at the assizes
</p>
<p>sometimes.
</p>
<p>Did you transcribe them ? I did not.
</p>
<p>Persons are not likely to go through the labour
</p>
<p>of transcribing notes unless paid for them ? No ; it
</p>
<p>is not usual.
</p>
<p>You were absent at Trim four days out of the six.
</p>
<p>Now, wiU you swear that you transcribed your
</p>
<p>notes in the other two ? I cannot exactly say.
</p>
<p>Did you in three days ? I tliink I did.
</p>
<p>Will you swear you did ? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Were you to be paid by the job ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Not by the time ? No, I was never paid by the
</p>
<p>time. I was always paid by the year.
</p>
<p>Whether there was anything to be reported or
</p>
<p>not ? Yes.

</p>
<p>Now I should like to know how long you were in
</p>
<p>transcribing your notes ? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Were the notes applied for ? They were during
</p>
<p>my absence applied for at my house.
</p>
<p>Was the message in writing? I was told the day
</p>
<p>after if they were not sent tliat evening it would be
</p>
<p>too late.
</p>
<p>Of course you had not got them to send, and con-
</p>
<p>ceiving it was too late why did you set about it? I
</p>
<p>thought it might not be too late ; I thought it was
</p>
<p>said to hasten me (laughter).
</p>
<p>Then you did not believe it was too late ? I did
</p>
<p>not swear I believed it was too late ; I only swore
</p>
<p>tha,t I was told it was too late.
</p>
<p>And under that probability you sat down to do
</p>
<p>the work ? I did.
</p>
<p>When you took the notes you did not know they
</p>
<p>were to be used as notes of what passed at the meet-
</p>
<p>ing ? Certainly not.
</p>
<p>You had no idea on your mind at that time that
</p>
<p>you might be examined as a witness as to what passed
</p>
<p>at the meetings ? I had not ; I had seen so many
</p>
<p>meetings passed over in the records of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of wliich I had read language
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Never mind that (great laughter).
</p>
<p>Well, having seen so much passed over, and having
</p>
<p>some idea that it was too late, you, notwithstanding,
</p>
<p>took the notes and sent them in ? I did.
</p>
<p>You never suspected that you might be examined
</p>
<p>as a witness ? 1 thought it very improbable.
</p>
<p>And though you thought it very improbable, you
</p>
<p>sat to this hard work for a couple of days at least,
</p>
<p>and sent the notes? I did not send them.
</p>
<p>Well, then, how did they get out of your posses-

</p>
<p>Vou saw the placard on which you say there were
</p>
<p>the words  " Ireland, her own parliament, or the
</p>
<p>world in a blaze," the day of the meeting ? I did.
</p>
<p>At what time? A considerable time before the

</p>
<p>Did you hear Mr. Steele direct it to be taken ;

<p>Mr. O'Connell  It was I gave directions. ]
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  You mentioned a Mr. Robinson as !
</p>
<p>having suggested some plan at that meeting ? I did. I

<p>It was some plan as to the landlord and tenant
</p>
<p>question ? It was.
</p>
<p>Let us hear what Mr. Robinson said.
</p>
<p>[The witness took up his manuscript.]
</p>
<p>Allow me to ask you, in the first place, is not
</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson one of the people they call Quakers ?
</p>
<p>So it was stated.
</p>
<p>And he appeared to be so ? I did not see him at all.
</p>
<p>But what did he say ? He moved a resolution,
</p>
<p>and said, " When Ireland asked bread, what did you
</p>
<p>get but a stone ? and when you asked for ameliora-
</p>
<p>tion of your sad condition you got an arms' bill.
</p>
<p>AVe want no arms but our own two arms, and a
</p>
<p>head to guide us ; and wliile we move under the
</p>
<p>counsel of our Liberator, we will be sure not to
</p>
<p>make bad use of them." And in another page he
</p>
<p>said, " Instead of arms' bill tliey ought to give us
</p>
<p>fixity of tenure, to better the condition of the poor
</p>
<p>landholders. We do not want to do any harm to
</p>
<p>the landholders."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  My lord, we wish to have a copy
</p>
<p>of this gentleman's report, otherwise we will re-
</p>
<p>quire him to repeat it so as that it can be taken

<p>down by our own short-hand writer. We cannot

<p>see any objection to that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tomb  It never yet was done.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  All we want is a copy of his re-
</p>
<p>port.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I cannot see how we can grant it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell (to witness)  Have you read the
</p>
<p>whole of this report ? No.
</p>
<p>I think you stated that it was moved that a peti-
</p>
<p>tion to parliament be presented ? It was.
</p>
<p>Look to your note and say who moved tliat, and
</p>
<p>read out anything you read so slowly that we may
</p>
<p>be enabled to understand your evidence and take a
</p>
<p>note of it. Look to the Rev. Mr. Nolan's speech.
</p>
<p>I will.
</p>
<p>I suppose, Mr. M'Namara, you have no objec-
</p>
<p>tion that that note of your testimony should be
</p>
<p>made perfectly public, swearing as you did to the
</p>
<p>truth of it ? As far as I am concerned I have no
</p>
<p>objection .
</p>
<p>You are not paid for your report ? No.
</p>
<p>Whose property is it ? I do not know whose pro-
</p>
<p>perty it is.
</p>
<p>Did you make it out ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Is it not the produce of your ovm labour ? Yes.
</p>
<p>And is it not your own property unless you were
</p>
<p>paid for parting with it ? Yes.
</p>
<p>And now, sir, will you tell us what Mr. Nolan
</p>
<p>said? He said " I beg leave to move the adoption
</p>
<p>of a petition to parliament praying for a repeal of
</p>
<p>that fatal measure  the Union."
</p>
<p>Was that seconded ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Who seconded it? Dr. Walsh seconded it. Per-
</p>
<p>haps I ought to observe that the names were very

<p>few of them announced, and it was only from hear-

<p>swears that he, in the exercise of his duty, went
</p>
<p>round the town making his observations, and he
</p>
<p>says he saw great numbers collected and collecting
</p>
<p>in different parts of the town with different mottoes
</p>
<p>and banners.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  No, my lord, with great respect, that
</p>
<p>is not exactly said, and that is the foundation of my
</p>
<p>objection.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I didn't say it was what he said ;
</p>
<p>Ijut you interrupted me too soon. He said that he
</p>
<p>saw crowds of persons assembled, over and above
</p>
<p>those belonging to the town, and tliat he further ob-
</p>
<p>served, when he went about, sundry banners and
</p>
<p>sundry mottoes. I know he did not say they were
</p>
<p>brought in by the people, but he states what is a
</p>
<p>matter of fact, that while the preparations were go-
</p>
<p>ing on he saw those things  'tis clearly evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  He does not state where.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I Imow he doesn't, because you
</p>
<p>haven't allowed him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Don't say, my lord, that I haven't al-
</p>
<p>lowed him because I objected to his reading what he
</p>
<p>was about to read.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  He says it was in High-street.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I submit that a placard being posted in
</p>
<p>High-street cannot be evidence to affect parties on
</p>
<p>their trial here.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton_If you look into the case, cited
</p>
<p>here the other day, before Mr. Justice Holroyd, you
</p>
<p>will find this evidence was allowed.

<p>Mr. Henn  Suppose it would turn out that the

<p>sand persons assembled ; Iwge numbers of men
</p>
<p>passed through High-street #rom the Birr road ;
</p>
<p>there was an arch running across the whole street.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn again submitted that his objection was
</p>
<p>strengthened by the evidence ; the erection of that
</p>
<p>arch did not appear to be the act of any of the per-
</p>
<p>sons attending that meeting.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton-_The same objection would apply
</p>
<p>to the erection of the platform.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General cited the case of the King
</p>
<p>V. Hunt, in support of the admissibility of the evi-
</p>
<p>dence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon denied the analogy of the King v.
</p>
<p>Hunt with the present case. In that case there were
</p>
<p>four counts in the indictment, three for a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and one for an unlawful assembly ; the jury acquit-
</p>
<p>ted the defendant on the threefirst counts, and found
</p>
<p>him guilty on the last only. What evidence was a
</p>
<p>placard on the walls of Tullaraore, on the sixteenth
</p>
<p>of July last, against Daniel O'Connell and the other
</p>
<p>traversers, that they had been guilty of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>on that day, or at any other time. Why not give in
</p>
<p>evidence the placards which were posted on the walls
</p>
<p>of Dublin about tea-shops and the like ? The case
</p>
<p>of the King and Hunt, cited on the other side, was
</p>
<p>not like the present case at all. This was a case
</p>
<p>where it was alleged that the conspiracy constituted
</p>
<p>the crime, whereas it was in the case of tlie King and
</p>
<p>Hunt alleged that the crime was created by an un-
</p>
<p>lawful meeting. In the presentcase it was not dared
</p>
<p>to be asserted that any of the meetings were illegal.
</p>
<p>In the case of the King and Hunt, the crime was an
</p>
<p>illegal meeting ; and ii was not offered in evidence
</p>
<p>as to a conspiracy, nor was the court so absurd as to

<p>must not be, Ireland ought not be, Ireland shall not
</p>
<p>be. a serf nation." There were several mottoes on
</p>
<p>the platform one was, " 9,000,000 of people are
</p>
<p>too great to be dragged at the tail of any nation;"
</p>
<p>another, " He who commits a crime strengthens the
</p>
<p>enemy." There were eight mottoes taken down by
</p>
<p>me, but I think there were many more. I took
</p>
<p>" The Liberator, God bless hirA ; men of the Border
</p>
<p>Counties, hail him !" Another was 
</p>
<p>" Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
</p>
<p>Who never to himself has said.
</p>
<p>This is my own, my native land."
</p>
<p>Another motto was " Repeal," and under it was
</p>
<p>written, " Justice and prosperity to all classes and
</p>
<p>creeds." The crowds began to enter early, but the
</p>
<p>immense masses entered from 10 to 12 o'clock. The
</p>
<p>greater number came by the Birr road. A great number
</p>
<p>of bands came into town ; there were more than nine,
</p>
<p>exclusive of the TuUamore bands ; they were all tem-
</p>
<p>perance bands ; they did not come together, but at
</p>
<p>diiferent times ; there were great numbers with each
</p>
<p>band ; a great number of persons came on horseback ;
</p>
<p>the horsemen who entered by the road advanced in
</p>
<p>Sections of four.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrln  What do you mean by sections
</p>
<p>of four ?
</p>
<p>Witness  I mean four rode together, and then four

<p>followed, and so on ; I observed one person on horse-
</p>
<p>back in particular ; a horseman wanted to leave his
</p>
<p>l)lace, and this person said, " Damn you, keep your
</p>
<p>ranks." The horseman, I beUeve, wanted to speak
</p>
<p>to a friend ; I counted between seventy and eighty
</p>
<p>sections of horsemen ; there were about 300 altoge-
</p>
<p>ther, but I cannot say exactly ; the persons on foot

<p>endeavoured to keep some kind of order, but they
</p>
<p>did not keep it so well ; the infantry, or foot, kept

<p>round the temperance bands, but they did not

<p>keep such good order, as they were pressed by the

<p>crowd.

<p>ticular said?

<p>Witness, in continuation  Mr. O'Connell came
</p>
<p>the night before ; I think he slept in TuUamore ; I
</p>
<p>saw the arch I first mentioned in the morning ; the
</p>
<p>one opposite the chapel was not up the night be-
</p>
<p>fore ; it must have been put up after ten o'clock,
</p>
<p>for I was not there sooner ; I went through the
</p>
<p>town at from nine to half-past ten o'clock ; it is im-
</p>
<p>possible for me to be quite accurate as to the time ;
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell and others ascended the platform
</p>
<p>about two o'clock.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Did you see any other person
</p>
<p>there that you know besides Mr. O'Connell ? I saw
</p>
<p>that gentleman (pointing to Mr. Steele) ; I saw

<p>others also ; I think I'd know Mr. O'Connell.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell  Here I am (laughter).

<p>Mr. O'Connell. I heard part of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speech ; I was in the store over the platform ; I was
</p>
<p>about twelve or fourteen yards from it -, I never
</p>
<p>measured it ; 1 heard Mr. O'Connell say, " I came

<p>number of women in the town at the meeting.
</p>
<p>Did you see the people coming from church ? No ;
</p>
<p>I could not see the cliurch from the platform.
</p>
<p>Did you observe a banner with " God save the
</p>
<p>Queen" on it ? I did ; I repeated that motto before.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect a motto.  " The Queen, God bless
</p>
<p>her?" I did not take any minor mottoes.
</p>
<p>I see  only the principal ones ? I took all that
</p>
<p>were legible  those that were across the street and
</p>
<p>upon the platform.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect any with " Repeal and no sepa-
</p>
<p>ration," and " God bless the Queen ?" I do not. I
</p>
<p>did not take them down.
</p>
<p>When did you write out those mottoes you took
</p>
<p>from the platform ? I wrote them out that evening
</p>
<p>and on Monday morning following.
</p>
<p>When did you attend ? I attended on the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of Sunday, and on the day previous ; I sent a

<p>in before one o'clock, and some came in at that hour
</p>
<p>and after ; they came up the street, turned to the

<p>left, to the left again, and passed near the church ;
</p>
<p>the procession came up about half-past two o'clock ;

<p>I saw Mr. O'Conuell in the procession, and Mr.

<p>Shell with him X think ; ^witness correcting him-

<p>self) it was Mr. Steele I believe, but I am not posi-
</p>
<p>tive ; I was at the rere of my house when I heard
</p>
<p>the sound of music ; in about five minutes after the
</p>
<p>carriage of Mr. O'Connell, preceded by a part of the
</p>
<p>procession, came on and passed before I came up ;
</p>
<p>there were horsemen at it ; the people walked about
</p>
<p>fifteen abreast, with regularity and order ; music
</p>
<p>was playing all along ; I saw persons coming from
</p>
<p>church ; a good many walked through my own
</p>
<p>fields ; that was not the usual way for them to go ;
</p>
<p>a great many of those who lived at the top of the
</p>
<p>town, to the number of thirty-five or forty, walked
</p>
<p>through my fields ; the usual way was by the hack
</p>
<p>road ; three of the bands had military uniforms, and
</p>
<p>one of them, I believe the Roscrea band, had shoul-
</p>
<p>der-scales, like what the cavalry wear iu undress ;
</p>
<p>another hand wore an uniform cap, with a band and
</p>
<p>some device at the bottom ; the horsemen came
</p>
<p>from the west ; they came five abreast in a column,
</p>
<p>to use a military term ; I dare say there were about
</p>
<p>240 horsemen there ; except in one or two places,
</p>
<p>they generally kept order.

</p>
<p>State to the jnry the mottoes you saw, and where
</p>
<p>you saw them. Witness (referring to a paper) 
</p>
<p>One of the mottoes I observed was " Cead mile
</p>
<p>failte," on a large piece of calico, with a green
</p>
<p>border ; " Ireland for the Irish, and the Irish for
</p>
<p>Ireland;" "Every man who commits a crime gives
</p>
<p>etrengtli to the enemy ;"
</p>
<p>" Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
</p>
<p>AVho never to himself hath said "
</p>
<p>(loud laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Say that again.
</p>
<p>Witness 
</p>
<p>" Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
</p>
<p>Who never to himself hath said.
</p>
<p>This is my own, my native land"
</p>
<p>(laughter).
</p>
<p>" Welcome Erin's brightest star;" "Repeal and
</p>
<p>KO SEPARATION ;" "A population of nine millions
</p>
<p>is too great to be dragged at the tail of any other
</p>
<p>nation." Those are all I took down.
</p>
<p>Were you near the platform during the meeting,
</p>
<p>or when the chair was taken ? I was in or about
</p>
<p>fifteen yards distant.
</p>
<p>Were you sufficiently near to hear the speeches ?
</p>
<p>Yes, sir, I heard almost all the speeches ; at times
</p>
<p>with distinctness, at other times I did not.
</p>
<p>Did you at the time take a note of any thing you
</p>
<p>heard ? I did not.
</p>
<p>Tell me the first person of whose speech you have
</p>
<p>a note ? The first person that addressed the meet-
</p>
<p>ing I did not know his name.
</p>
<p>Which of the traversers did you see there ? I
</p>
<p>saw Mr. O'Counell, Mr. John O'Connell, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas Steele.

</p>
<p>Were they accompanied by any other persons ?
</p>
<p>By several persons 1 did not know.
</p>
<p>Were they accompanied by any persons that you
</p>
<p>did know ? No, sir.
</p>
<p>Did you hear Mr. O'Beirne speak ? Tes, sir ; the
</p>
<p>fii'st speaker was the chairman ; he said they would
</p>
<p>get all they wanted if they attended to their priests.
</p>
<p>Do you know who was the chairman ? I heard
</p>
<p>the chairman was a gentleman commonly called
</p>
<p>Count Nugent.
</p>
<p>Did you take any further note of what the chair-
</p>
<p>man said ? He talked of landlords and property.
</p>
<p>I could hear distinctly what he stated  " Ireland
</p>
<p>would be able to supplj' herself, and it was the duty
</p>
<p>of every Ii-ishman to rally round the standard of
</p>
<p>repeal."
</p>
<p>Have you any further note of this speech ?
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  What speech is that ?
</p>
<p>Sergeant Warren  The speech of the chairman.
</p>
<p>Count Nugent.
</p>
<p>Wlio was the next speaker ? A gentleman that I
</p>
<p>heard was Priest O'Beirne; he said, "This is not
</p>
<p>the time to give a silent vote; every Irishman
</p>
<p>should rally round repeal. The loyalty of the Irish
</p>
<p>is not the loyalty of expediency ; Ireland will be
</p>
<p>raised again to the dignity of a nation, and cease to
</p>
<p>be legislated for by those who are ignorant of her
</p>
<p>condition and hostile to her prosperity." He then
</p>
<p>inquired, have we a voice in the legislature? and
</p>
<p>several cries from the multitude and persons on the
</p>
<p>platform, no, no. At the conclusion of his speech,
</p>
<p>THREE CHEERS WERE GIVEN FOR THE QuEEN,
</p>
<p>and three hearty cheers for the' repeal of the union.
</p>
<p>Who was the next speaker ? I have no note of
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>neither knew him then, or know him now ; I was
</p>
<p>standing about fifteen yards behind the platform.
</p>
<p>The speaker's back was to you ? Yes, and I felt
</p>
<p>difficulty in taking down what was said.
</p>
<p>Did you write this paper there ? I did.
</p>
<p>Had you a table to write upon ? I had the win-
</p>
<p>dowstool.
</p>
<p>Then you were in a house ? I was in a house.
</p>
<p>Was it your own house ? No, sir, I don't reside
</p>
<p>in Longford ; I was sent there on duty.
</p>
<p>Was there any one with you ? Another, Head-
</p>
<p>constable Maguire.
</p>
<p>Did he take notes ? No ; we were sent there to
</p>
<p>observe the meeting, and to take such notes as we
</p>
<p>might be able to take at the time.
</p>
<p>That is, what you considered it material to take
</p>
<p>notes of? Yes, so I understood.
</p>
<p>Yes, that is the way you understood your instruc-
</p>
<p>tions  so Mr. O'Connell made a speech ? Yes.
</p>
<p>And you say that he made a very significant pause
</p>
<p>in it ? Yes, he made a very significant pause.
</p>
<p>Wliat did it mean ? It was such a language as
</p>
<p>was intended to convey something not expressed
</p>
<p>(laughter).
</p>
<p>And to convey that to 40,000 persons ? It was
</p>
<p>impossible for Mr. O'Connell to be heard by 40,000
</p>
<p>persons ; only a few hundreds could hear him.
</p>
<p>Could not the pause have been conceived by the
</p>
<p>40,000 persons ? I cannot say so.
</p>
<p>Were you behind him when he made this mighty
</p>
<p>pause ? Yes, I occupied the position I have stated.
</p>
<p>Turn your back to the jury, and show them what
</p>
<p>kind of pause Mr. O'Connell made with his back to
</p>
<p>you ? Really, I don't know where the jury are.

</p>
<p>There they are  and be good enough to express
</p>
<p>the pause to the jury ? I don't think I could so suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully express the pause in the same form that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell did (laughter).
</p>
<p>You did not see his face while he was making the
</p>
<p>pause ? It was Mr. O'Connell's form of language.
</p>
<p>But I am not talking of language, but the pause.
</p>
<p>Did you see his face while he was making the pause ?
</p>
<p>I may not have seen his face  I cannot recollect that
</p>
<p>I saw his face.
</p>
<p>You don't recollect whether it was his face or his
</p>
<p>back you saw ' Did he turn his face to you ? Not
</p>
<p>to me.
</p>
<p>How long was that pause  ^that significant pause?
</p>
<p>It may be three, or four, or five seconds ; it was not
</p>
<p>a minute certainly.
</p>
<p>Did he make any pause but the one in his whole
</p>
<p>speech ? He did ; but not such pauses as that.
</p>
<p>The pause of three seconds was then the very
</p>
<p>longest ? I don't say three seconds ; it may have
</p>
<p>been three seconds.
</p>
<p>What was he saying while he was making that
</p>
<p>pause ? He was saying nothing of course (laughter).
</p>
<p>Will you teU me what he was saying before he
</p>
<p>paused ? Can you tell me from your memory ?
</p>
<p>Your questions are so rapid that my memory will
</p>
<p>not allow me to tell you without reference to the ma-
</p>
<p>nuscript.
</p>
<p>Tell us now what he was saying before he made
</p>
<p>the pause ? One of the pauses was in this sentence,
</p>
<p>" To submit to the Saxon and oppressor, and to be
</p>
<p>ground to the dust, but we were never con-
</p>
<p>quered," that is the best description of the pause I
</p>
<p>can give you.

</p>
<p>, Were they theretofore Mr. O'Connell arrived?
</p>
<p>Before ten o'clock there were a great number of per-
</p>
<p>sons assembled in Longford.
</p>
<p>Were they coming in from that hour up to two
</p>
<p>o'clock shouting and leaping, and wheeling sticks
</p>
<p>all the time ? As they came into town I observed
</p>
<p>those bodies. .
</p>
<p> But tell me were all those bodies shouting ? 1
</p>
<p>should say not.
</p>
<p>Were any on your oath? Oh, yes, I should say so.
</p>
<p>Where were the police ? I'oUce ! I suppose at
</p>
<p>such a meeting as that they dare not show their faces
</p>
<p>(laughter). . , . , ^,
</p>
<p>bid you show your face ? I was m plain clothes.
</p>
<p>Did you mean to disguise yourself? I was on
</p>
<p>duty in plain clothes.
</p>
<p>Had you any police under your coutrol? J\o:
</p>
<p>there was only another and myself from Sligo.
</p>
<p>Upon your oath at what part of the town did you
</p>
<p>hear the shouting, and see the wheeling of sticks ?
</p>
<p>Something about the centre of the street, opposite
</p>
<p>the house where I was.
</p>
<p>Whose house were you in ?
</p>
<p>Witness (to the Cliief Justice) Shall I answer
</p>
<p>that, my lord.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Yes.
</p>
<p>Witness The house belonged to a person of the
</p>
<p>name of Needham.
</p>
<p>What is he ? A person in business.
</p>
<p>What business ? I believe he is a chandler.
</p>
<p>Have you a nose ? I have.
</p>
<p>Then, is he a chandler ? I believe he is.
</p>
<p>What street is his house in? I cannot say the
</p>
<p>name of the street.

<p>Is it in the main street ? I cannot say.
</p>
<p>Did you see any policemen there that day ? Not
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>No policemen walking up and down? There
</p>
<p>were no pohcemen there on duty.
</p>
<p>Now, I ask you on your oath, did you see any
</p>
<p>policemen walking up and down the streets of Long-
</p>
<p>ford that day ? Not from the time the meeting
</p>
<p>gathered, but in the early part of the day I did see
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>Every one at that meeting must have heard this
</p>
<p>shouting as well as you ? Every one who was near
</p>
<p>enough might have heard it. I might have heard
</p>
<p>the shouting farther off than where 1 was.
</p>
<p>Wasn't the wheeling of sticks equally visible to
</p>
<p>every body else as well as you ? Yes. _ _
</p>
<p>It was a very remarkable tiling, wasn't it ? De-
</p>
<p>cidedly. .
</p>
<p>You saw no police there e.xcept between eight and
</p>
<p>ten o'clock in the morning ? I might have seen
</p>
<p>them up to twelve o'clock. I may have seen an
</p>
<p>odd policeman about.
</p>
<p>I know you might  was he armed ? He may have
</p>
<p>had arms.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon My lords, these are the only
</p>
<p>answers I can get from the witness.
</p>
<p>Witness Indeed, sir, I am disposed to answer
</p>
<p>you fairly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Your disposition, sir, is a mat-
</p>
<p>ter for the consideration of the jury. Now, tell me,
</p>
<p>did you see police in the street that day, and don't
</p>
<p>give me a maybe answer to it ? I can only give
</p>
<p>you the same answer I gave to you before : I may
</p>
<p>have seen them.

<p>Mr. Beunett  Ah, Mr. Fitzgibbon, do permit me

<p>to go on (laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I have not the slightest objec-
</p>
<p>tion (laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett  Well now, witness, you were pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding to describe the bands ; they wore military
</p>
<p>caps, you say '!
</p>
<p>Witness ^Yes, with red or gold bands ; some of
</p>
<p>the bands were preceded by a man dressed like a
</p>
<p>drum-major, who held a large stick in his hand ;
</p>
<p>the people followed the bands ; I formed an estimate
</p>
<p>of the numbers who were present ; I should think
</p>
<p>from 40 to 50,000 people were met together on the
</p>
<p>occasion ; I observed a person leading the crowds ;
</p>
<p>the person in question 1 believe to be a Catholic
</p>
<p>priest ; the people came on in military order ; I
</p>
<p>mean by military array a land of rank and file order
</p>
<p>of marching ; there were several persons on horse-
</p>
<p>back ; about 100 of them came into town with Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell ; he sat on the front box or seat of his
</p>
<p>carriage ; there was a gentleman sitting with him
</p>
<p>whom I understood to be Bishop Higgins ; Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele was inside, and another person, who seemed
</p>
<p>to be a clerical gentleman ; I did not know who he
</p>
<p>was ; Mr. O'Connell arrived about two o'clock ; he
</p>
<p>was preceded by three or four bands playing ; the
</p>
<p>houses in the town were decorated with green
</p>
<p>boughs, and some of the people carried boughs in
</p>
<p>their hands, waving them ; some of the jieople had
</p>
<p>sticks, and on approaching the platform way was
</p>
<p>made for them, and some of them had sticks and
</p>
<p>were brandishing them ; the meeting broke up
</p>
<p>between four and five o'clock ; I was near the plat-

<p>sons were on it ; I did not see a.ny of the traversers
</p>
<p>present except Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele ; I
</p>
<p>took notes of the mottoes that day ; but Mr. Jolui-
</p>
<p>ston took notes of the speeches from a window,
</p>
<p>under my observation, as we could not both conve-
</p>
<p>niently take them ; the motto over the platform was,
</p>
<p>" Ireland for the Irish, aud the Irish for Ireland ;"
</p>
<p>that was very conspicuous ; in another part of the
</p>
<p>town was " A population of nine millions is too
</p>
<p>great to be dragged at the tail of another nation;"
</p>
<p>it was on a large piece of white calico or linen, and
</p>
<p>was fastened to the wall on the Dublin road ; it was
</p>
<p>after the meeting I saw it there ; another motto was,
</p>
<p>*' He that commits a crime strengthens the enemy '."
</p>
<p>I am quite sure the word enemy was there ; another
</p>
<p>motto was "Repeal and no separation"  " Cead
</p>
<p>mile faille ;" I heard Mr. O'Connell speak that
</p>
<p>day in the early part of his speech ; he said theirs
</p>
<p>was no vain cause ; I cannot charge my memory
</p>
<p>with having heard him make any allusion to trial
</p>
<p>by jury, or the administration of justice.
</p>
<p>Did you hear him make any allusion to judges or
</p>
<p>courts of justice? lie said, " they took the com-
</p>
<p>mission of the peace from your respected sup-
</p>
<p>porters;" he also said to the people, "Go home
</p>
<p>quietly, and tell your friends what you have heard,
</p>
<p>and when I want you again won't you be ready 'i"
</p>
<p>that sentence was impressed on my memory, as it
</p>
<p>was the conclusion of his speech ; after that Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele came forward with a parcel of papers ; he said
</p>
<p>they were speeches of the Liberator's, made about
</p>
<p>some measure of Sir liobert Peel's.
</p>
<p>After Mr. O'Connell made his speech did you see
</p>
<p>any brandishing of sticks ? No.

<p>They were commg m parties, you said t 1 es,

<p>they were coming in military .array.

<p>Where did they halt ? Near the platform.
</p>
<p>That was when they could not go furtlier ? Yes
</p>
<p>(immense laughter).
</p>
<p>Did they stand at ease? I suppose they did, for
</p>
<p>some of tliem must have come a good distance, and

<p>therefore they must have been tired (laughter). l
</p>
<p>Oh, they wanted rest, and then they stood at

<p>member a meeting at Mallow on the lltli of last
</p>
<p>June ; I was there ; it was on Sunday ; I went in
</p>
<p>uniform to Mallow, but I changed my clothes be-
</p>
<p>fore the meeting took place ; before the meeting
</p>
<p>commenced I saw a procession ; I saw it pass through
</p>
<p>Mallow in the direction from which I was told Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell was to come ; 1 cannot recollect the place
</p>
<p>where it passed ; I was a stranger there ; the pro-
</p>
<p>cession was a very numerous one; there were seve-
</p>
<p>ral bands ; there were persons on horseback ; the

<p>procession marched in regular order with bands and

<p>banners ; the bands playing and the colours flying ;

<p>several of them liad cards attached to their button-

<p>papers round their hats with the words " O'Connell's
</p>
<p>Police" written upon them.
</p>
<p>Describe what order they went in ? They marched
</p>
<p>four or five deep. The horsemen went much in the
</p>
<p>same way, apparently in regular order.
</p>
<p>Did you see persons taking more particular com-
</p>
<p>mand than others ? I did.
</p>
<p>Describe in what positions in the procession they
</p>
<p>were? They were outside the body or the ranks as
</p>
<p>I may call it, and appeared to give directions to the
</p>
<p>others. Some of the horsemen ivho did take this
</p>
<p>command had wands with something like ribbon tied
</p>
<p>on the top. It iras late in the evening when the
</p>
<p>procession returned ; Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele
</p>
<p>rctm-ned with it ; I do not remember ever to have
</p>
<p>seen so large a meeting.
</p>
<p>How many think you were there ? I think there

<p>were some hundreds of thousands; 1 have never
</p>
<p>seen such a crowd before.
</p>
<p>In what part of the procession were Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell and Mr. Steele ? I did not see them in the
</p>
<p>procession, but I saw them on the platform.
</p>
<p>Where was the platform erected ? It was erected
</p>
<p>near the shambles in JIallow.
</p>
<p>Was it a large place ? It was a very large open
</p>
<p>space, and it was very nearly full ; I went near to
</p>
<p>the platform ; I was about ten yards from it ; some-
</p>
<p>tuaes nearer, but the place where I stopped at last
</p>
<p>was about ten yards from the platform.
</p>
<p>Did you take a note of the proceedings ? I did
</p>
<p>not.
</p>
<p>Did you hear Mr. O'Connell's speech ? I heard
</p>
<p>part of it.
</p>
<p>Are you able to state the substance of any part
</p>
<p>or parts of it ? I am. The first thing that was done
</p>
<p>was to present an address to Mr. O'Connell ; so at
</p>
<p>least I was told, for at that time I could not get
</p>
<p>near enough to the platform
</p>
<p>What did you hear Mr. O'Connell say ? He first
</p>
<p>said that he came to tell them a secret, and thought
</p>
<p>there were enough of them to keep it (laughter).
</p>
<p>He told them too that the union should be repealed
</p>
<p>by some time that I cannot exactly remember
</p>
<p>(laughter).
</p>
<p>Did he mention any time? He did. He also said
</p>
<p>that they should have " Ireland for the Irish. They
</p>
<p>might have England for the English, and Scotland
</p>
<p>for the Scotcli, but Ireland should be for the Irish ;
</p>
<p>and that he defied them to keep it from them, for
</p>
<p>they were too numerous, too determined, and too
</p>
<p>temperate." lie said that on the face of the earth

</p>
<p>Howwere you dressed ? I went in regular uniform.
</p>
<p>Were you in Mallow the night hefore? I was
</p>
<p>not ; I went there in the morning.
</p>
<p>Did you meet other policemen there? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were the policemen dressed in uniform ? They
</p>
<p>were.
</p>
<p>Was Mr. Anderson, the sub-inspector, there ? He
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>Was Mr. Anderson out at the meeting ? He was.
</p>
<p>Does not he know Mallow better than you do ?
</p>
<p>He does.
</p>
<p>What time did you undress ? I can't say exactly.
</p>
<p>The procession was going through the town at the
</p>
<p>time,
</p>
<p>Do you swear the full procession was going
</p>
<p>through ? I say a part of it was going through ; the
</p>
<p>last part of it.
</p>
<p>What time did you leave the street to undress ? I
</p>
<p>was not in the street then ; I undressed in the bar-
</p>
<p>rack.
</p>
<p>What time of the day did you undress ? I should
</p>
<p>think (hesitating) about 1 cannot exactly say.
</p>
<p>You are very precise about the words Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell used. What time did you put on the disguise 
</p>
<p>was it one o'clock ? It might be about one o'clock.
</p>
<p>Was it one o'clock ? It might be more ; I think
</p>
<p>it was between one and two.
</p>
<p>Did you see the whole of the procession ? I don't
</p>
<p>know that I saw the whole of it ; I saw half of it.
</p>
<p>What half did you see ? The last half.
</p>
<p>Where did you see it ? I saw it going out of
</p>
<p>Mallow.
</p>
<p>Are you a constabulary man? I am.
</p>
<p>You have fought no battles ? No.

</p>
<p>Oh ! then you are not a military, you are a civil
</p>
<p>man. Now you have said the procession marched
</p>
<p>in military order, with bands playing, colours flying
</p>
<p> are these words your own? Are they your own
</p>
<p>spontaneous effusion ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were you not frightened by this military array,
</p>
<p>close columns and marching order ? No.
</p>
<p>What tuues did the bands play.  did they play
</p>
<p>"Paddy Carey," or " Paddy from Cork," or " God
</p>
<p>save the Queen ?" I took no notice.
</p>
<p>This was not a military procession ? No, a civil
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>There were bands of music and banners ? I saw
</p>
<p>a great many banners.
</p>
<p>What do you mean by the horses being in appa-
</p>
<p>rently particular good order  were they fat ? That
</p>
<p>would be good order.
</p>
<p>Now, what became of the guns and muskets, the
</p>
<p>cannon, the dead and wounded of this battle ?
</p>
<p>There were none at all. The horsemen were mounted
</p>
<p>five or six a-breast, and more after them.
</p>
<p>I see. You are sure the horses' tails were not
</p>
<p>tied together. Were there real living men on them ?
</p>
<p>There were, and women behind the men.
</p>
<p>Yes, on pillions. Now tell us, did they charge
</p>
<p>you or you charge them ? I did neither.
</p>
<p>Had the women their arms about the men. They
</p>
<p>were holding on.
</p>
<p>Now, I have to ask a question suggested by Mr.
</p>
<p>Hatchell. Do you conceive that an ofience against

<p>the arms' act (great laughter).

</p>
<p>By JIR. FREEMAN.
</p>
<p>I was a constable in August ; I remember the 6th
</p>
<p>of August ; I was in Baltinglass on that day ; I was
</p>
<p>stationed at Donard ; it is about eight miles distant
</p>
<p>from Baltinglass : I was ordered to Baltinglass the
</p>
<p>evening before the meeting ; the meeting took place
</p>
<p>on Sunday ; I saw a great number of persons there
</p>
<p>between twelve and one o'clock ; I observed persons
</p>
<p>coming in on large waggons from the KathvUly
</p>
<p>side; they had a band with them ; I saw banners ; I
</p>
<p>did not observe any inscriptions ; the meeting was
</p>
<p>held a little outside the town ; I saw the Kev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Nolan before the meeting took place ; I heard him
</p>
<p>desire the people to go and meet Mr. O'Connell ; I
</p>
<p>heard a man say the shouting will frighten the pid-
</p>
<p>geons; another said "yes, and the Protestants too;"
</p>
<p>this was before the Rev. Mr. Nolan desired the peo-
</p>
<p>ple to go to meet Mr. O'Connell ; I was dressed in
</p>
<p>plain dress ; Mr. O'Connell came in about one
</p>
<p>o'clock ; I heard a man say " this is the day that
</p>
<p>will frighten Saunders ;" a gentleman named Mr.
</p>
<p>Eobert Saunders lives about two English miles from
</p>
<p>the town ; the expression was before Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>came up.*

<p>To Mr. FreemanI attended the place of meet-
</p>
<p>ing ; I saw Mr. O'Connell there, and Mr. Nolan, Mr.
</p>
<p>FarreU, and Mr. Copeland ; I saw the two Mctcalfs
</p>
<p>there, and a person who was pointed out to be Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele ; I would know Mr. Steele's person (the wit-
</p>
<p>ness here identified Mr. Steele, who was sitting near
</p>
<p>him incourt) ; Mr. O'Connell was there also ; he re-
</p>
<p>collected liim saying tliat he did not despair of get-
</p>
<p>ting the repeal, for he had the people to back liim ;
</p>
<p>he also said there were some millions of money sent
</p>
<p>out of the country ; he did not say how much ; he
</p>
<p>stated that the taxes were to be paid out of some
</p>
<p>fund ; he heard him say something about Lord
</p>
<p>AV'icklow ; he heard him call Mr. Felton a " bog-
</p>
<p>trotting agent;" does not recollect that he heard
</p>
<p>him say anything more.
</p>
<p> Thia Mr. Saunders is a gentleman resident in the county
</p>
<p>of Wicklow, about the distance stated from Baltinglass, and
</p>
<p>who had given directions to his tenantry, on pain of displeasure
</p>
<p>to some, and on pain of ejectment to others, not on any pre-
</p>
<p>text to join the meeting at Baltinglast. An anecdote of much
</p>
<p>point n-as told upon the day of the meeting with considerable
</p>
<p>gusto by the country people. Mr. Saunders summoned. Ihrough
</p>
<p>his bailiffs, all his.tenantry together. They attended. Amongst
</p>
<p>them was an old man named Byrne, comfortable in circum-
</p>
<p>stances, a peasant in station, hut independent in mind and prin-
</p>
<p>ciple. Old Byrne, on entering the presence chamber of his
</p>
<p>landlord, inquired why he had been sent for. Sir. Saunders re-
</p>
<p>plied, that he was an.^ious to warn all his tenants not to join the
</p>
<p>procession of Mr. O'Connell on the ensuing Sunday, or to take
</p>
<p>any steps to swell the numbers of the repealers of the country.
</p>
<p>Tlie old man bluntly replied that he was a repealer, and that he
</p>
<p>had already promised to join the procession, where he was de-
</p>
<p>termined to be, and he made an argicmentum ad Jwminem which

</p>
<p>Then you mean to say that during that day you
</p>
<p>endeavoured to avoid the eyes and notice of those
</p>
<p>who knew you? 1 did.
</p>
<p>What did you do to avoid tlie eyes of those who
</p>
<p>knew you ? I would shift from any place when I
</p>
<p>saw them unto another part of the crowd.
</p>
<p>Lest they should see you ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Bid you expect that shuffling forward to another
</p>
<p>placein the crowd would prevent your being seen
</p>
<p>by those who knew you ? I did.
</p>
<p>Did you dip your head ? No.
</p>
<p>Did you hide your head ? No.
</p>
<p>Then, what j ou did when you saw an acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance was to shift your way through the crowd? I
</p>
<p>worked my way through the crowd with my face
</p>
<p>up. I endeavoured to make my way through them.
</p>
<p>Did you find any place in the crowd, when looking
</p>
<p>around you, you could not see any men who knew
</p>
<p>you ? I did.
</p>
<p>Where was that ? In front of the platform ; I
</p>
<p>cannot say how ir that was from the platform ;
</p>
<p>perhaps twenty yards, sometimes it might be ten
</p>
<p>yards ; I was in front of Mew's hotel, which is about
</p>
<p>a mile from Baltinglass, wlien I heard the words,
</p>
<p>" This is the day when we'll frighten Saunders ;" I
</p>
<p>cannot tell tlie name of man, woman, or child, that
</p>
<p>heard that phrase ; I was close to the man who said
</p>
<p>these words ; I might have seized him ; I cannot tell
</p>
<p>you who he was ; I did not ask his name ; I recorded
</p>
<p>the phrase ou paper the same day ; I took a note
</p>
<p>of it before the meeting was held by Mr. O'Connell ;

<p>Idid so on one side of the road.
</p>
<p>Show me your note ? I haven't it here.

</p>
<p>did, and I have it here (lianding a paper to counsel).
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbou (looking at tlie paper)  Did you
</p>
<p>not a while ago tell the jury that you made this

<p>note the day of meeting ? I did not tell them that
</p>
<p>note.
</p>
<p>Did you believe I was speaking of anything else
</p>
<p>than that paper? Did you believe my question wiis
</p>
<p>about tlie paper in 3'our hand, or any other paper ?
</p>
<p>I cannot answer that question.
</p>
<p>Now answer this simple question  Where is the
</p>
<p>original note from wliicli you say you wrote this
</p>
<p>book? I think it is burnt.
</p>
<p>Dead men tell no tales : when did you burn it?

<p>Wlien I went home after sending in my report.
</p>
<p>Were you ordered to take notes ? I was ordered
</p>
<p>to take notice of particular words.
</p>
<p>Do you mistake ray words ? I do not remember
</p>
<p>that I was ordered to take notes. It was witli a

<p>take notes.
</p>
<p>Report the expression again respecting Saunders.
</p>
<p>I will. It was, " This is the day that will frighten

</p>
<p>This is what you have written ? Something to

<p>that effect. I heard words to that efTect from se-

</p>
<p>HENRY TWISS, EXAMINED BY MR. HARTLEY, Q.C.
</p>
<p>I am a sub-constable, and was so in the month of
</p>
<p>August last'; I was stationed at the time atRedcross,
</p>
<p>in the county Wiclclow, which is thirty miles distant
</p>
<p>&om Baltinglass ; I was at Baltinglass on the 6th of
</p>
<p>August last ; there was a repeal meeting there that
</p>
<p>day ; I arrived at Baltinglass the evening before ; I
</p>
<p>went there on duty ; I made a report to my officer
</p>
<p>of what ' I saw there ; I sent in my report on the
</p>
<p>morning of the next day ; this document now
</p>
<p>handed to me is the report, and was written by me ;
</p>
<p>there was a great crowd at the meeting ; I am not
</p>
<p>at all in the habit of estimating numbers, but I am
</p>
<p>sure there were, at all events, 5000 persons at the
</p>
<p>Baltinglass meeting ; I am confident that I am
</p>
<p>greatly under the mark ; I saw Mr. O'Connell there,
</p>
<p>and others whom I don't know ; the chair was at
</p>
<p>one time occupied by a gentleman named Copeland,
</p>
<p>from near Dunlavin ; another gentleman was sub-
</p>
<p>sequently called to the chair ; the second chairman
</p>
<p>was some person from KilcuUeu-bridge ; I was at
</p>
<p>the meeting about one o'clock ; I mixed in the
</p>
<p>crowd ; I was ordered to attend the meeting in plain
</p>
<p>clothes, and I did so ; I saw people coming from
</p>
<p>various directions, some came from Carlow, others
</p>
<p>from TuUow ; I was on the platform at one time, at
</p>
<p>another time I was within five 3'ards of it ; I heard
</p>
<p>people in the crowd make various political observa-
</p>
<p>tions ; I heard some people saying, " Ireland was
</p>
<p>trampled on, but she shall be so no longer ;" " the
</p>
<p>time is nearer than you think : let us wait patiently
</p>
<p>for some months. Ireland was trampled on long

<p>enough, but she shall be so no longer ;" the meeting

<p>lasted, as well as I remember, from about half- past
</p>
<p>two to six o'clock ; I was shown Mr. Steele there
</p>
<p>that day ; I saw the Rev. Mr. Murtagh there ; he
</p>
<p>made a speech ; I cannot state what he said, as I
</p>
<p>made no I'eport of it.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. M'DONOGH.
</p>
<p>I took no notes of what was said by the speakers.
</p>
<p>I presume that when you heard the people say,
</p>
<p>" the time is nearer than you think," they were
</p>
<p>speaking of the repeal of the union ? 1 could not
</p>
<p> say ; but you may suppose so if you like.
</p>
<p>You are not able to ascribe any other meaning to
</p>
<p>it ; but the repeal of the union was the subject they
</p>
<p>were discussing ? It was.
</p>
<p>Did you see all the people retire ? I can't say I
</p>
<p>saw them all retire, but I saw them going away in
</p>
<p>every direction.
</p>
<p>There was no breach of the peace at that meet-
</p>
<p>ing ? Not that I could see.
</p>
<p>And no tendency to a breach of the peace ? No ;
</p>
<p>iiot the slightest.
</p>
<p>Everything went off very peaceable? It did.
</p>
<p>I am exceedingly sorry that you did not take
</p>
<p>notes of everything that occurred there. You may

<p>go down.

<p>PATRICK LENERAN EXAMINED BY MR. TOMB.
</p>
<p>I am a police-constable ; I was at Baltinglass
</p>
<p>on the 6th of August last ; I saw the people coming
</p>
<p>into the town to meet Mr. O'Connell; I can-
</p>
<p>not say how many, but there were some thousands
</p>
<p>there; I saw them going over the bridge of Baltin-
</p>
<p>glass on the Dublin road ; I was at the meeting
</p>
<p>when Mr. O'Connell came there ; I was in plain
</p>
<p>clothes; I was about thirty yards from the plat-

<p>EXAMINATION OF CONSTABLE HUGHES.
</p>
<p>223
</p>
<p>characterised that meeting. He was not aware that
</p>
<p>there was any express or direct authority upon this
</p>
<p>point ; but in the case of the Manchester riots it
</p>
<p>was ruled that the persons who seemed to liave at-
</p>
<p>tended a meeting showed the nature of that meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  In that case it was what they
</p>
<p>said when they compelled others to go with them
</p>
<p>and to form part of the meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore thought that in tliie absence of autho-
</p>
<p>rity the court had only to look to common sense and
</p>
<p>common justice, and he would ask them if, after a
</p>
<p>meeting was over, men thought proper to act ille-
</p>
<p>gally, that every individual who attended that meet-
</p>
<p>ing one hour before was to be made responsible for
</p>
<p>that ? Such a thing was inconsistent with common
</p>
<p>sense and justice.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General submitted that the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the witness was admissible. In the case
</p>
<p>of Bedford against Burley, the circumstance arose
</p>
<p>from expressions used by the party going to the
</p>
<p>meeting, and Mr. Justice Holroyd decided (and the
</p>
<p>decision was affirmed by the full court on the motion
</p>
<p>for a new trial) that the evidence was admissible,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it was calculated to show the character of
</p>
<p>the intended meeting. In the present case the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the witness now under examination went
</p>
<p>to prove that statements were made by persons
</p>
<p>coming from the meeting at Baltinglass in reference
</p>
<p>to the question asked at that meeting, whether, when
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell came again, they would be there to
</p>
<p>meet him, or expressions to that effect. It was a
</p>
<p>question for the jui-y as to the way that language
</p>
<p>was understood. Then they had the people leaving
</p>
<p>that meeting declaring that they were ready to turn

</p>
<p>Common sense told them that what was understood
</p>
<p>by that meeting was more calculated to be proved
</p>
<p>by what they said after the meeting was over than
</p>
<p>before they came there. He contended that the
</p>
<p>meeting was not over because the people niight be
</p>
<p>dispersing. In the 15th volume of the State Trials,
</p>
<p>page 533, they would find it so laid domi; and sup-
</p>
<p>pose that some of the parties who attended the meet-
</p>
<p>ing at Baltinglass went off to Mr. Saunders's house
</p>
<p>and committed an act of violence, on it going from
</p>
<p>the meeting, he insisted that would be evidence
</p>
<p>against every person that spoke at .that meeting.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General proceeded to read the case
</p>
<p>which he relied on, and contended that the people
</p>
<p>alluded to were coming from the meeting, and that
</p>
<p>the actions and expressions of such people could be
</p>
<p>given in evidence as the acts of the party who at-
</p>
<p>tendedthe meeting. They had it in evidence already
</p>
<p>that the people were heard to say that we must have
</p>
<p>repeal, as we are sober and determined men, and
</p>
<p>could it be said that they could not give such decla-
</p>
<p>rations in evidence after the meeting, when declara-
</p>
<p>tions before the meeting were admissible?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside sustained the objection, and said
</p>
<p>the case cited by the Attorney-General made en-
</p>
<p>tirely for his (Mr. W.'s) clients ; he read from page
</p>
<p>111 of Philips on evidence, and said it was ruled that
</p>
<p>the conduct of persons going to a meeting could be
</p>
<p>received in evidence, because it was a declaration of
</p>
<p>the thing done before the meeting, but anything
</p>
<p>said or done after was not evidence, and of course
</p>
<p>could not be received. (Mr. Whiteside read from
</p>
<p>page 201 of Philips, and contended thatitwas in his

<p>there were a great many people witli him ; when
</p>
<p>witness saw him it was when he was coming near
</p>
<p>the platform ; did not see liim until he was near the
</p>
<p>platform ; heard people speak of Mr. Saunders be-
</p>
<p>fore Mr. O'Connell came in ; witness took notes of
</p>
<p>what passed that day ; he wrote them next morn-
</p>
<p>ing ; will swear to their correctness ; refers to wliat
</p>
<p>he heard respecting Mr. Saunders ; heard three or
</p>
<p>Ibur people say that Mr. Saunders' house ought to
</p>
<p>be attacked, because it was once the seat of blood ;
</p>
<p>this was said before Mr. O'Connell came in ; heard
</p>
<p>them say nothing more, except tlmt Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>ordered the procession to pull up opposite Mr.
</p>
<p>Saunders' house until he had him cheered ;' this is
</p>
<p>what caused the conversation about the attack ; a
</p>
<p>man came up who said he saw Mr. O'Connell at
</p>
<p>Mr. Saunders' ; I heard a part of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speech ; I heard him say he would do away with
</p>
<p>the poor laws and taxes, and that the poor
</p>
<p>would be supported from the consolidated fund ;
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell ordered the carriage to stop to have
</p>
<p>Mr. Saunders cheered ; I heard some person say he
</p>
<p>gave those orders; I heard the crowd say they
</p>
<p>would and should have the repeal ; that was before
</p>
<p>the crowd dispersed ; I heard no other expression ;
</p>
<p>the expression I have just mentioned was used after
</p>
<p>tlie people left the iield where the meeting was

<p>held ; I heai'd no other expressions used but those

<p>I have mentioned before.

<p>You had no work as a policeman there ? No, I
</p>
<p>had not.

<p>There was no breach of the peace ? Tliere was
</p>
<p>not, or any appearance of one.
</p>
<p>You heard some person say Mr. O'Connell desired
</p>
<p>to have a cheer for Mr. Saunders ? I did.
</p>
<p>Where were you then ? I was in the crowd at
</p>
<p>the same time.
</p>
<p>Was there any other policeman near you ? No.
</p>
<p>Was there any inspector at the meeting ? No.
</p>
<p>Were there any superiors to you there? Yes,

<p>Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Hawkshaw were there.
</p>
<p>Wliere was Mr. Hawkshaw? He was in the

<p>town ; I was speaking to him there.
</p>
<p>And when one person said there should be a cheer
</p>
<p>at Mr. Saunders's another said the house might be

<p>Did the people go away peaceably after the meet-

</p>
<p>Waa it about the meeting? It was; I was in-
</p>
<p>structed to inquire of tlie Rev. Mr. Tierney, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of many reports that were in circulation,
</p>
<p>when the meeting was to take place ; I went to him
</p>
<p>in consequence, and spoke to him ; I asked liim if
</p>
<p>he would have the kindness to let me know when it
</p>
<p>would take place.
</p>
<p>Detail the conversation that passed between you ?
</p>
<p>When I asked him, he replied that the day of the
</p>
<p>meeting was not fixed, as it depended on the conve-
</p>
<p>nience of some barristers to whom he had written to
</p>
<p>attend; he on that occasion said the union was
</p>
<p>not binding on conscience, and that is was a nul-
</p>
<p>lity.
</p>
<p>Do you remember anything else he said ? I do ;
</p>
<p>he talked with regard to the feeling for repeal having
</p>
<p>become general, and had extended itself (or words to
</p>
<p>that effect) to the army ; I recollect his saying that
</p>
<p>it would not now be so easy to spill the blood of their
</p>
<p>fellow-men who were seeking their rights peace-
</p>
<p>ably.
</p>
<p>Repeat, and repeat slowly what Mr. Tierney said
</p>
<p>about the army ? I cannot speak as to the precise
</p>
<p>words, but I will take care not to exaggerate them.
</p>
<p>He said the army was now in favour of repeal, and
</p>
<p>that it partook of the enthusiasm of the people, and
</p>
<p>that they could not be led to bayonet their fellow-
</p>
<p>men who were seeking to redress their grievances
</p>
<p>peaceably.
</p>
<p>Do you remember anything else that passed be-
</p>
<p>tween you ? I do. I recollect his saying on that
</p>
<p>occasion  " See what the army has done in Spain."
</p>
<p>This was on the 16th of June.

</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney ? I do not know what you may esteem
</p>
<p>it. I was there on duty to inquire about the meeting.
</p>
<p>Was nobody present but Mr. Tierney ? There
</p>
<p>was a person with him who retired as I came ; but
</p>
<p>there was nobody within hearing at the time the
</p>
<p>conversation passed.
</p>
<p>This, you say, was on the 16th of June ? Yes.
</p>
<p>What brought you to Mr. Tierney's ?
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  He has stated that already.
</p>
<p>That was on the 16th of June, and the meeting
</p>
<p>was on the 15th of August ? It was.
</p>
<p>Had you knoAvn Mr. Tierney before ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Were you in police uniform ? I was.
</p>
<p>How far does Mr. Tierney live from you ? About
</p>
<p>a quarter of a mile.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney had frequent opportunities of seeing
</p>
<p>you ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore objected to the witness being examined
</p>
<p>as to a private conversation occurring so long before
</p>
<p>the meeting. They came there prepared to meet
</p>
<p>certain overt acts stated in the indictment. One of
</p>
<p>those overt acts was the meeting of the 15th of
</p>
<p>August, but they were not in any manner apprised
</p>
<p>either by the bill of particulars or by the indictment
</p>
<p>of a conversation alleged to have taken place two
</p>
<p>months before the meeting. If the crown was at
</p>
<p>liberty to give evidence of a conversation two months
</p>
<p>before the meeting, it might go back ten years before
</p>
<p>it ; he did not know anytliing that would make any
</p>
<p>difference with regard to time. It was hard to be
</p>
<p>prepared to repel anything this witness said, being
</p>
<p>apprised that such evidence was to be given.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said the conversation was a de-
</p>
<p>claration by one of the parties himself respecting the
</p>
<p>226

<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Have you these notes -with you at present? I
</p>
<p>have an extract of them ; here is the note which I
</p>
<p>took of one passage of the conversation (and that
</p>
<p>the only passage), immediately after the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>When did you take that note ? That is part of a
</p>
<p>note 'which I took on the very day of the conver-
</p>
<p>Bation on the 17th of June ; I entered that in my
</p>
<p>diary.
</p>
<p>Come, come, sir, I am not asking you anything
</p>
<p>about your diary. Take that piece of paper in your
</p>
<p>hand, sir, and tell me is that the note you took of
</p>
<p>the conversation of June 16 ? That is a copy of the
</p>
<p>note which I entered in my diary on the occasion in
</p>
<p>question.
</p>
<p>What has become of your diary? I suppose it is
</p>
<p>at the station in the county.
</p>
<p>"WTio has the care of it there ? The senior consta-
</p>
<p>ble; I saw it last on the day I was coming up to
</p>
<p>town, namely, on the 10th of this month ; I made
</p>
<p>the entry on the very day of the conversation, but
</p>
<p>as I have already told you it only refers to that
</p>
<p>portion of the dialogue which alluded to the time of
</p>
<p>holding the meeting; there is no other remark
</p>
<p>upon the same subject except that of which this do-

<p>y 16th of June. Saw Priest Tierney upon the sub-

<p>time was not as yet fixed for the meeting, that it de-
</p>
<p>pended on the convenience of some barristers who
</p>
<p>were to attend, but that he would give due and pro-

<p>tled, &c. &c. &c." (laughter).
</p>
<p>Have you in your diary any note of Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney's expressions relative to repeal, Spam, and the
</p>
<p>army? No, I have not ; I did not think it neces-
</p>
<p>sary to make any note of them.
</p>
<p>I did not ask you what might or might not appear
</p>
<p>necessary to your sublime judgment ; I merely asked
</p>
<p>you had you any note of those expressions? No, I
</p>
<p>have not a word on the subject in my diary.
</p>
<p>Have you a note anywhere of the expressions re-
</p>
<p>lative to Spain, the army, and repeal ? When I un-
</p>
<p>derstood that I was to be examined on these trials I
</p>
<p>took a short sort of a memorandum-like of those ex-
</p>
<p>pressions ; it was some time in October last when I
</p>
<p>was informed that I would be examined ; I do not
</p>
<p>attend the chapel of Clontibret, for I am not a Eomau
</p>
<p>Catholic ; I have known Mr. Tierney for some years.
</p>
<p>Did he ever assist you in keeping the peace? If
</p>
<p>it be Mr. Tierney's wish that I should advert to any
</p>
<p>aad which he may have given me in the discliarge
</p>
<p>of our duties I have no objection to speak out. If the
</p>
<p>court are of opinion tliat there would be no impro-
</p>
<p>priety in giving the information, I ivill give it ;
</p>
<p>but there is a general understanding in the force
</p>
<p>that the police are rather to view as a secret the as-
</p>
<p>sistance they get from any one in their duties.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  There is no objection.
</p>
<p>Witness  He has given me assistance, so far as
</p>
<p>sendmg for me and making me acquainted with
</p>
<p>some circumstances, such as conceahug the birth

</p>

</p>
<p>culars, but you'd better go on. I also recollect his

<p>Proceed then ? The chairman afterwards desired
</p>
<p>the people when the meeting terminated to depart
</p>
<p>to their homes peaceably, and to insult no person.
</p>
<p>Is that the whole of wliich you have notes of the
</p>
<p>chairman's speech ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect anything the chairman said, that
</p>
<p>you have not on your notes ? I do not recollect
</p>
<p>anything else.
</p>
<p>You said you heard other speeches, and took notes
</p>
<p>of them ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect a gentleman of the name of Daunt
</p>
<p>at that meeting ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Have you any note of the speech made by him ?
</p>
<p>I have.
</p>
<p>Did you hear him deUver it ? I did.
</p>
<p>State what he said ? Mr. O'Neill Daunt said, " I
</p>
<p>bless God that I belong to this land I bless God
</p>
<p>that I belong to this people. This people shall have
</p>
<p>this land if they are worthy, and who dare say that
</p>
<p>you are not worthy ? The repeal movement now
</p>
<p>or never, now and for ever. If Peel and Wellington
</p>
<p>came and said we will give you everything you want,
</p>
<p>only give up repeal, we would not  never. Before
</p>
<p>God, we swear they shall never bully us out of it.
</p>
<p>The Irish parliament would afford us the power of
</p>
<p>our keeping it if we had it, still we wiU stand to our
</p>
<p>colours, and proceed in the way O'Connell marked
</p>
<p>out for us." The speaker, after enumerating the
</p>
<p>different grievances he said the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>laboured under, said " in place of six struggles, one
</p>
<p>struggle will do for all."

<p>Mr. Henn If the court or jury require it I have
</p>
<p>iio objection ; but I do object to counsel requiring a
</p>
<p>witness to repeat a thing over and over again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Baker I thought the words might not have
</p>
<p>been distinctly heard.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  The way in which I un-
</p>
<p>derstood the witness was this  that the speaker, after
</p>
<p>bnunierating what he called grievances, said, " in
</p>
<p>place of having separate battles for each of these,
</p>
<p>one battle, or one struggle would do for all."
</p>
<p>Did he say anything more? Yes, he said, " are
</p>
<p>we not as good as the English ?" A voice said,
</p>
<p>" better" (a laugh). " We are here to-day, to tell
</p>
<p>John Bull that we shall have it. Ireland shall be
</p>
<p>free, for Ireland deserves her liberty. The Cionti-
</p>
<p>bret boys will fight the 1-epeal battle to the last, with
</p>
<p>God's blessing, to stand to our colours for repeal,
</p>
<p>and nothing but repeal."
</p>
<p>Is that the whole of it? It is.
</p>
<p>Did you heat other speakers address the assem-
</p>
<p>bly ? I did.
</p>
<p>Who did you hear? I heard a Mr. M'Mahon ;
</p>
<p>he was introduced as a Counsellor M'Mahon ; he
</p>
<p>spoke to a resolution which was moved by the Rev.
</p>
<p>Thomas Tierney.
</p>
<p>Do you know any of the gentlemen who are tra-
</p>
<p>versers here ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Did you see any of them at that meeting ? I saw

<p>the Rev. Mr. Tierney, but none other of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers.

</p>
<p>Not the least tendency to it. The platfonn was
</p>
<p>crowded, and there was a person whose duty it was
</p>
<p>to preserve order, and to prevent too many persons
</p>
<p>from going up there or crowding it too much.
</p>
<p>Was there any objection to your taking notes
</p>
<p>there ? Not the least objection.
</p>
<p>All was done openly, and without the least ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of concealment ? Yes, certainly ; every-
</p>
<p>thing was done openly.
</p>
<p>Were you on the platform ? Yes.
</p>
<p>In uniform ? Yes, in uniform. I was driven back
</p>
<p>on the platform by the pressure of the crowd, and
</p>
<p>was obliged to go to the end of it ; I was driven back
</p>
<p>in the same manner as any one else ; I spoke to a
</p>
<p>person who was pushing up to the top, and said to
</p>
<p>him  " Perhaps you will see the account of it all in

<p>the newspapers in a day or two ?" and he replied

<p>" No doubt about that ; but we don't want to see the

<p>notes you take of it" (laughter). My brother police-

<p>man, M'Mahon, was then taking notes also.

<p>present ; I observed music and banners ; there were

<p>also bands ; the bands generally had certain uni-

</p>
<p>"Where are you from?" He replied: "The ba-
</p>
<p>rony of Shilmalier, in the county of Wexford ; I
</p>
<p>asked him, " Did many come with you ?" He said,
</p>
<p>" Yes, 2,000 from Wexford, and we were joined by
</p>
<p>3,000 from Kildare ;" when Mr. O'Connell's carriage
</p>
<p>had passed, he said to witness: " You did not take
</p>
<p>off your hat to Mr. O'Connell ;" witness replied,
</p>
<p>" Certainly not?" he said, " You don't belong to
</p>
<p>our party ;" witness replied, " I do not belong to any
</p>
<p>party here:" he then said, "I knew by the curl
</p>
<p>of your lip you did not belong to us" (laughter in
</p>
<p>court) ; witness said, " I am glad your eyes told
</p>
<p>you so much truth, I am amusing myself here;" he
</p>
<p>said. " We will let you into the field for all that;"
</p>
<p>some clergymen ran up and desired the person to
</p>
<p>leave witness alone ; on going down the hill witness
</p>
<p>heard some one crying out, " Long life to the fur-
</p>
<p>riners," (witness thinks the country people mistook
</p>
<p>Major Westenra for a foreigner, by re.oson of his

<p>Did you receive orders to attend the meeting ?
</p>
<p>Yes, I was desired to attend it ; it is my duty to

</p>
<p>Now, did any of the persons who passed know
</p>
<p>you ? I am sure they did ; they all knew me ex-
</p>
<p>cept those who came from Westraeath.
</p>
<p>Did they salute you as they were passing in re-
</p>
<p>view ? No.
</p>
<p>They did not give you a cheer ? Not at all.
</p>
<p> That was not very respectful towards the general
</p>
<p>(laughter)? I am afraid they did not think me
</p>
<p>their general (laughter).
</p>
<p>Did the people see you ? They saw me very well.
</p>
<p>I live at a country place ; Rathline is the nearest
</p>
<p>village. Trim, I believe, has the nearest temperance
</p>
<p>band. The band was dressed in a new uniform on
</p>
<p>that occasion.
</p>
<p>How long before this occasion had you seen them ?
</p>
<p>I saw them on different occasions. I saw them on
</p>
<p>Patrick's Day.
</p>
<p>The bands jelebrate Patrick's Day by drinking
</p>
<p>water ? I believe so.
</p>
<p>Did you ever see a uniform on them before ? No,
</p>
<p>it was made for that occasion.
</p>
<p>How do you know ? Because I saw them making
</p>
<p>in a tailor's shop.
</p>
<p>Oh, then, they were exposed to view ? No ; I
</p>
<p>went into a tailor's shop on business, and I saw
</p>
<p>them there.
</p>
<p>Did you never see them in uniform before ?
</p>
<p>Never.
</p>
<p>Well, then, in a fancy dress ? Yes, but it ap-
</p>
<p>proached nearer to uniform on that occasion.
</p>
<p>It was very like the uniform of the 34 th ? Ex-
</p>
<p>actly like.
</p>
<p>You heard one person say, " Keep the step," and
</p>
<p>another said, " Keep the rank ?" 1 did.

<p>JOHN ROBINSON EXAMINED B7 MR. BENNETT.
</p>
<p>What are you ? 1 belong to the constabulary ; I
</p>
<p>am a constable.
</p>
<p>Were you at a meeting at a place called Clifden?
</p>
<p>I was.
</p>
<p>When was it ? On the 17th of September.
</p>
<p>What day of the week was it ? On Sunda}', the
</p>
<p>17th of September.
</p>
<p>Is it in Connemara ? Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>Did you see the meeting assemble? How many
</p>
<p>persons were there ? I should think at least between
</p>
<p>four and five thousand.
</p>
<p>Did you see any person pass by the barrack going
</p>
<p>to the meeting ? I did.
</p>
<p>How far was the barrack from the place of meet-
</p>
<p>ing ? About one hundred yards ; the meeting was
</p>
<p>rather in a flat, but there was elevated land over it ;
</p>
<p>it was in a field.
</p>
<p>Describe to the jury the character and nature of
</p>
<p>the persons you saw pass by, and the number ? I
</p>
<p>saw first the Rev. Mr. M'Namara mounted on horse-
</p>
<p>hack, and a hundred persons or better mounted,
</p>
<p>and he at their head.
</p>
<p>In what order did they move ? They were about
</p>
<p>four or five deep, to the beat of my recollection.
</p>
<p>Yes.

</p>
<p>And you say Mr. M'Namara was at their head ?
</p>
<p>Did you take notice of anything in their hats ?
</p>
<p>I saw repeal cards.
</p>
<p>How do you know they were repeal cards ? I
</p>
<p>saw some of them afterwards, and some of them
</p>
<p>were convenient to me at the time ; they were stuck
</p>
<p>in the bands of their hats in front.
</p>
<p>Did you hear that body get any name ? I heard
</p>
<p>a person term them the BaUinakill repeal cavalry.
</p>
<p>How many horsemen, in all, were there ? On the
</p>
<p>lowest calculation, one hundred..
</p>
<p>Were there many on foot ? There were a good
</p>
<p>many.
</p>
<p>Did you see any other persons pass by ? I saw
</p>
<p>Mr. Murray, of Galway, pawnbroker.
</p>
<p>How was he going ? Sitting in a gig dressed in a
</p>
<p>green frock made either of calico or silk, I don't
</p>
<p>know which, and a large badge or scarf of the same
</p>
<p>colour, embroidered with gold leaf or something
</p>
<p>similar to it, and with a large repeal card much
</p>
<p>larger than any one of the remainder that wore
</p>
<p>them ; he had a green ribbon round his hat ; it was
</p>
<p>a straw hat he wore.
</p>
<p>About how many men were following him ? I
</p>
<p>should think about a hundred or more mounted,
</p>
<p>and three or four hundred walking.
</p>
<p>In what order were they moving? They went
</p>
<p>similar to the men that were with Mr. M'Namara,
</p>
<p>and apparently they regularly fell in.
</p>
<p>Did you observe any order amongst the footmen ?
</p>
<p>JJo, not at that time.
</p>
<p>Did you at any time ? When the procession was
</p>
<p>going to the platform they were matching in much

</p>
<p>You need not mind what you heard.
</p>
<p>Were there many women there ? There were a
</p>
<p>great many.
</p>
<p>Were there many small persons ? I did not per-
</p>
<p>ceive many children.
</p>
<p>I did not confine myself to children, but what I
</p>
<p>would call parsoons ? There were.
</p>
<p>Were there a great many barefooted people there ?
</p>
<p>There were.
</p>
<p>Was the majority of them barefooted ? No.
</p>
<p>Was there a vast number of barefooted people
</p>
<p>there ? There was.
</p>
<p>Men or women? I did not see any of the wo-
</p>
<p>men barefooted.
</p>
<p>But were the men ? Not the men, but the boys.
</p>
<p>Where were you when some persons called out
</p>
<p>those are the BallinaldU cavalry ? In the street.
</p>
<p>- Did you know the person that called out the Bal-
</p>
<p>linakill cavalry ? No.
</p>
<p>Was it a man or a woman ? A man.
</p>
<p>Was it a countryman ? It was a countryman.
</p>
<p>Did you not know him? No.
</p>
<p>Was he standing quietly in the street when he
</p>
<p>said it ? No, he was in a kind of trot.
</p>
<p>Was he walking ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Walking in a trot (laughter). Did any person
</p>
<p>hear him but you ? There is a good deal of fun in
</p>
<p>that country ? Yes.
</p>
<p>Do you think he was jeering them when he said
</p>
<p>it ? No.
</p>
<p>Do you think he was serious ? I do.
</p>
<p>Had they carbines ? No.
</p>
<p>Had they weapons? No.
</p>
<p>Had they bridles ? They had.

</p>
<p>Had they bridles with bits ? I cannot say that.
</p>
<p>Were any of them made of suggauns ? I did not
</p>
<p>remark any of them with suggauns.
</p>
<p>Were there any of them made of twisted whi-
</p>
<p>thies? I do not know what you mean.
</p>
<p>Hopes made of the bog wood ? They generally
</p>
<p>had.
</p>
<p>Had any of them straw saddles ? They had.
</p>
<p>Had all that were after Mr. M'Namara saddles ?
</p>
<p>They all had saddles.
</p>
<p>Had they leather saddles ? They had all leather
</p>
<p>saddles to the best of my knowledge.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett  Where was it you said you saw the
</p>
<p>people having the bridles made of twisted whithies 
</p>
<p>do you mean to say one of those parties, the one
</p>
<p>that followed Mr. M'Namara, had not them, and
</p>
<p>that the other party, the one that followed Mr. Mur-

<p>ray, had them ? Those who followed Mr. M'Na-

<p>ray had them.

<p>Witness  Ireland dragged at the tail of another
</p>
<p>nation (laughter).
</p>
<p>Attorney-General (looking very sharply at the
</p>
<p>witness)  Are you sure that was it ? Yes, sir, Ire-
</p>
<p>land di-agged at the tail of another nation ; observed
</p>
<p>one flag attached to a private carriage with the
</p>
<p>words Kepeal and no separation ; there was another
</p>
<p>motto, " MuUaghniast and its martyrs  a voice from
</p>
<p>the grave" (laughter); there was another represent-
</p>
<p>ing a dog with a harp, and sornething I cannot well
</p>
<p>describe before him, like a tree without branches,
</p>
<p>and lions or dogs looking up, and underneath it was
</p>
<p>written 
</p>
<p>" No Saxon butchery shall give hlooi-gouts for a
</p>
<p>repast ;
</p>
<p>The dog is roused and treachery expelled from Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast."
</p>
<p>There were some other mottoes in the pavilion, hut
</p>
<p>did not think it necessary to take them, as they
</p>
<p>were of no conseq^uence ; the words, " God save the
</p>
<p>Queen, or the Queen, God bless her," were there
</p>
<p>also; Mr. O'Connell arrived about three o'clock;
</p>
<p>the platform was occupied for about two hours;
</p>
<p>the people did not all go away after the meeting
</p>
<p>broke up ; some of them staid there until near

<p>morning ; heard no observations among the people

</p>
<p>cept those you stated ? No.
</p>
<p>You mixed among the crowd very much that day
</p>
<p>in the discharge of your duty ? Very much.
</p>
<p>And very minutely and attentively observed what
</p>
<p>vras going on ? Very much so.
</p>
<p>You listened attentively to what was said ? I did.
</p>
<p>You mingled with the groups of people and at-
</p>
<p>tended to what they were saying ? Anything I
</p>
<p>could see or hear X noticed it.
</p>
<p>And all you did see or hear them say or do was
</p>
<p>to shout for Repeal and Old Ireland? That's all.
</p>
<p>Although you were there from eight o'clock in
</p>
<p>the morning until nest morning? Y'es ; I was there
</p>
<p>the evening before, and all that day, and up to
</p>
<p>eleven o'clock at night.
</p>
<p>And you were sent specially from Cork for that
</p>
<p>purpose; I presume it was because you were a
</p>
<p>stranger that you were selected ? That may have
</p>
<p>been the reason, hut I cannot saj'.
</p>
<p>Now, as we have what you heard, I want what
</p>
<p>you saw. Was not that a very peaceable assembly?
</p>
<p>Indeed, it was very much so as far as I saw.
</p>
<p>No riot or breach of the peace ? All was very
</p>
<p>quiet in that respect ? There was nothing wrong
</p>
<p>that I could either see or ascertain.
</p>
<p>When you told the Attorney-General that parties
</p>
<p>remained there at night, did you mean to convey
</p>
<p>that they remained for the banquet ? Persons re-
</p>
<p>mained in tents and places enjoying themselves.
</p>
<p>In peace and quiet ? Yes, in peace and quiet as
</p>
<p>far as I could see.
</p>
<p>You stated that you saw bands coming from the
</p>
<p>direction of Carlow and Kilkenny. Do you know if
</p>
<p>these were temperance bands ? I think they were.

<p>right ; he called them pieces of timber, and then
</p>
<p>went on ; but it is of no consequence.
</p>
<p>Were you here on the entry of George the Fourth
</p>
<p>into Dublin? I was not.
</p>
<p>You were at Mullaghmast dinner ? I was, but
</p>
<p>not all the time.
</p>
<p>One of the mottos, you say, was, "No Soxon
</p>
<p>(laughter) butchery shall give biood-gout for a re-
</p>
<p>past" (loud laughter) ? Yes.
</p>
<p>There was something better for repast on that
</p>
<p>occasion, I believe ? Some appeared not to be satis-
</p>
<p>fled ; the dinner appeared to be rather short.
</p>
<p>You say another motto was  Ireland dragged
</p>
<p>to the tail of .another nation. That was the purport.

</p>
<p>have, would she not ?
</p>
<p>Mr, O'Counell  And a strong tail (laughter).
</p>
<p>Witness  There were private carriages in the pro-
</p>
<p>cession.
</p>
<p>Kid you take down all the mottoes ? I did not.
</p>
<p>Why did you not take them down ? Because I
</p>
<p>thought it was no consequence.
</p>
<p>Perfectly harmless ? Quite so.
</p>
<p>Not material ? Just so.
</p>
<p>Therefore you did not take them ? Just so.

</p>
<p>The Attorney-General called on the Clerk of the

<p>Crown to read the ballad, which the last witness
</p>
<p>proved to have been circulated at Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said the evidence of the last witness,
</p>
<p>as he understood it, was this, that there were pa-
</p>
<p>pers distributed or sold in the course of the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, that he himself purchased one which he had

</p>
<p>another poUceman, with a mark upon it. Under
</p>
<p>those circumstances he did not consider that docu-
</p>
<p>ment admissible.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General said the witness saw the
</p>
<p>other policeman put a mark upon it.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said Mr. Moore was not ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the entire of the witness's evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he had been out of court during a
</p>
<p>part of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh said they had an additional objec-
</p>
<p>tion. They contended upon the evidence that that
</p>
<p>document was not receivable. Very great latitude
</p>
<p>has been allowed in cases of conspiracy where it was
</p>
<p>fair to be inferred that the distribution of the docu-
</p>
<p>ment was in furtlierance of the common object, and
</p>
<p>by some of the conspirators ; but he (Mr. M'Do-
</p>
<p>nogh) had never heard, and he apprehended there
</p>
<p>was no authority to show, that wliere it was proved,
</p>
<p>as in this case, that in this vast and peaceable as-

<p>opportunity of selling their ballads or songs  it
</p>
<p>would be unjust in the last degree to inculpate
</p>
<p>those who took no part in their sale, and never sanc-

</p>
<p>not the remotest connection between any of the

<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>opening statement of the Attorney-General, he said
</p>
<p>that he knew the printer of these documents, and
</p>
<p>named, as such, a person called Hanvey, who lived
</p>
<p>in Fishamble-street. He has not, as he did in the
</p>
<p>cAse of other documents, produced the printer to
</p>
<p>prove that they were got out by the directions of
</p>
<p>any particular person, or the objects for which they
</p>
<p>were printed. There was no evidence that they
</p>
<p>were published by any one charged with the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. The Attorney-General had not, as in the case
</p>
<p>of Browne, produced any person to prove that they
</p>
<p>emanated from Mr. O'Connell or the repeal associa-
</p>
<p>tion. On the contrary, it was likely that the docu-
</p>
<p>ment was published by this man (Hanvey) for pro-
</p>
<p>fit ; that it was his own act, and not that of any one
</p>
<p>charged with the conspiracy. He did not object to
</p>
<p>the placards being given in evidence, because they
</p>
<p>were operjly and pubhcly exhibited at the meetings ;
</p>
<p>but there was no proof to show that these papers
</p>
<p>were exposed in the presence of Mr. O'Connell or
</p>
<p>his friends, or that they had any knowledge of their
</p>
<p>contents. He did not say that it was necessary to
</p>
<p>prove that the circulation was the act of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell or any of the traversers, but it should be proved

<p>adopted by some one of them. No doubt but for-
</p>
<p>merly evidence in cases of tliis sort was permitted
</p>
<p>to an extreme length ; yet they had not on the other
</p>
<p>hand, cited any case similar to the one before the
</p>
<p>court. K the circulation was an object with the
</p>
<p>association, they would not have charged for it; a
</p>
<p>few pence was of no value to them. It had not been

<p>its objects. The Attorney-General, when comment-
</p>
<p>ing upon it in the presence of the jury, ought not
</p>
<p>to have stated that it was a slaughter committed by
</p>
<p>CathoUcs.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell  I said a slaughter of Catholics by
</p>
<p>Catholics.
</p>
<p>.Solicitor-General  The question for the court
</p>
<p>was, should those documents be admitted or re-
</p>
<p>jected. If admitted it was open to the traversers
</p>
<p>to give any explanation about them which they
</p>
<p>could. He thought they ought to be admitted upon
</p>
<p>two distinct grounds. First, they were part of the
</p>
<p>res gesta  the character of the meeting, the transac-
</p>
<p>tions there, the circulation of such matter as was
</p>
<p>contained in the documents, he would assume bore
</p>
<p>directly upon the charge in the indictment. That
</p>
<p>charge was for entering into a conspiracy to excite
</p>
<p>animosity amongst her Majesty's subjects ; and the
</p>
<p>proper means to be used for the supporting of that
</p>
<p>charge was to prove the large numbers at these
</p>
<p>meetings, the notices which convened them, the ha-
</p>
<p>rangues which were made, and they (the crown)
</p>
<p>were then proving what occurred at one of these
</p>
<p>meetings. MuUaghmast meeting, it should be ob-
</p>
<p>served, had been called by advertisement, and it
</p>
<p>vas proved that Mr. Browne, the printer of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation, printed that placard or advertisement,
</p>
<p>calling the meeting. He did not care whether the
</p>
<p>placard calling that meeting was circulated gratui-
</p>
<p>tously or sold for money, as it did not make any
</p>
<p>material difference for his purpose ; the advertise-
</p>
<p>ment calling that meeting was part and parcel of
</p>
<p>the meeting itself. He differed widely with Mr.
</p>
<p>Monahan, for it was not necessary for the crown to
</p>
<p>HEADING OP EEPBAL BALLADS.
</p>
<p>235
</p>
<p>lagkfflast, on the 1st of October, and Mullaghmast
</p>
<p>WM the place named by the parties calling the meet-
</p>
<p>ing. The people called on to attend that meeting
</p>
<p>got a Tery significant hint of what they were called
</p>
<p>together for, as it was stated at the foot of the ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement, "Remember Mullaghmast." That
</p>
<p>was to bring the matter to their recollection. They
</p>
<p>had it in eridenoe that Mr. O'Counell attended at
</p>
<p>the meeting, and explained very fully why the
</p>
<p>scene of the meeting was chosen at JIullaghniast.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell made two speeches  one iuthe morn-
</p>
<p>ing, and one in the evening, at the banquet. Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett, another of the traversei-s, was there, and
</p>
<p>also made a speech, and both the traversers stated
</p>
<p>that Mullaghmast was chosen for the meeting for a
</p>
<p>particular purpose, and that it was done firmly and
</p>
<p>deliberately, and chosen beforehand. It should not
</p>
<p>be forgotten again that the people were called on to
</p>
<p>remember Mullaghmast. What was Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>object in fixing on Mullaghmast as the place of
</p>
<p>meeting but to bring to the remembrance, and per-
</p>
<p>haps to the feelings of those assembled, the scenes
</p>
<p>alleged to have taken place there in former times.
</p>
<p>Whether that was likely to produce excitement or
</p>
<p>not he did not say ; but one of the reasons given by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell himself for assembUng there was to
</p>
<p>bring to the recollection of the meeting the treachery
</p>
<p>and cruelty of the Saxon race, and the want of safety
</p>
<p>there was in dealing with them. The people then
</p>
<p>were invited to come to Mullaghmast as a provincial
</p>
<p>meeting, and consequently a very great one, and
</p>
<p>the invitation or summons to them was given ex-
</p>
<p>pressly by the association through their officer and
</p>
<p>secretary, Mr. Ray, and the cards were printed by

</p>
<p>Mr. Browne, the printer to the association. Now,
</p>
<p>when Mr. O'Connell and the association took upon
</p>
<p>themselves to collect the people together, in such
</p>
<p>crowds, to the amount of 250,000, it was worthy of
</p>
<p>consideration to say whether it was not an illegal act.
</p>
<p>He would not say whether it was or was not, but he
</p>
<p>^id that those who ventured to collect the meeting,
</p>
<p>must abide the consequences of their own act as to
</p>
<p>what was done connected with the meeting. There
</p>
<p>being 250,000 persons assembled together at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast, the first thing done was the handing about
</p>
<p>a paper purporting to be a full and true account of
</p>
<p>the dreadful slaughter or murder at Mullaghmast
</p>
<p>on the bodies of 400 Roman Catholics. Whether
</p>
<p>this was given away as a donation, or whether it
</p>
<p>was sold, did not appear to him to be of nmch con-
</p>
<p>sequence. Their being circulated and distributed
</p>
<p>over the field was a necessar^ consequence of the
</p>
<p>assepibling of the people at the place to hear and re-
</p>
<p>ceive a history of what had occurred before Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell addressed them on the same subject. He
</p>
<p>could not pass over the fact that Mr. O'ConneU, in
</p>
<p>the two speeches which he made, and Mr. Barrett,
</p>
<p>in the one which he made, drew a picture of what
</p>
<p>ha4 occurred at Mullaghmast similar to the one pre-
</p>
<p>sented for sale to the people. They all concurred
</p>
<p>in their representations of what took place three
</p>
<p>hundred years before, by those who were of Saxon
</p>
<p>connection  the treachery and cruelty they prac-
</p>
<p>tised, and that they could never be trusted again.
</p>
<p>So far, therefore, from being imconnected with the
</p>
<p>professed object of the meeting, it seemed to him to
</p>
<p>be intimately connected with it ; and it would be
</p>
<p>impossible to call the attention of the jury from the
</p>
<p>236
</p>
<p>THE lEISS STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>The document was then handed in and read.
</p>
<p>[It purported to give " a full, true, and accurate
</p>
<p>account" of the terrible massacre of four hundred
</p>
<p>Irish at the Kath-more of MuUaghmast. The first
</p>
<p>paragraph contained a statement of the cruelty com-
</p>
<p>mitted on the occasion referred to, and proceeded to
</p>
<p>give an extract from Taaffe's History of Ireland,
</p>
<p>wherein the massacre was described as occurring
</p>
<p>during the reign of Queen Mary. Some comments
</p>
<p>followed, wherein Mary was designated as a bloody
</p>
<p>queen. The document concluded by giving a sum-
</p>
<p>mary of different authorities as to the date of the
</p>
<p>massacre ; and the author, having satisfied himself
</p>
<p>that it occurred during Mary's reign, proceeded to
</p>
<p>show that whether Catholicism or Protestantism
</p>
<p>were triumphant in England, Ireland was always
</p>
<p>treated by English rulers with equal barbarity and
</p>
<p>treachery.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside applied to have a copy of this do-
</p>
<p>cument furmshed him. They wished to have the
</p>
<p>name of the printer.
</p>
<p>The paper was handed to the learned gentleman.
</p>
<p>Tlie Attorney-General then put in a copy of her
</p>
<p>Majesty's speech as evidence, requiring as much of
</p>
<p>it as related to Ireland to be read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore objected to its being produced.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General was very much surprised
</p>
<p>at the objection, Tliere had been in the course of
</p>
<p>these trials several speeches of Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>proved, in which he commented on the speech of
</p>
<p>her Majesty at the prorogation of parliament, tak-
</p>
<p>ing it sentence by sentence, and he apprehended a
</p>
<p>document so commented on might be taken in evi-
</p>
<p>dence. It was alleged that it was not the speech of

<p>her Majesty, but the speech of her ministers  that
</p>
<p>it contained language only fit for a fishwoman  that
</p>
<p>it was a Billingsgate speech, and other observations
</p>
<p>of an extraordinary character were made respecting
</p>
<p>it. He therefore asked, quite as a matter of course,
</p>
<p>that the portion of the speecli so commented on by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell should be put in, it being clearly a
</p>
<p>matter of evidence.
</p>
<p>The London Gazette of August 25th, and the Duh-
</p>
<p>lin Gazette of August 29th, were then put in, and
</p>
<p>the portion of her Majesty's speech referring to
</p>
<p>Ireland, and expressing her determination to main-
</p>
<p>tain the legislative union between the countries,
</p>
<p>was read.

</p>
<p>He said he was at Liverpool on the 13th of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber; he saw placards of a particular description
</p>
<p>posted in various parts of the town of Liverpool ;
</p>
<p>he took down one of the placards which he now
</p>
<p>produced ; it was a copy of the address to all the
</p>
<p>subjects of the British crown, containing a state-
</p>
<p>ment of the grievances of Ireland, and which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell had wished to have in circulation in all
</p>
<p>the towns of the empire ; the name of Mr. Browne
</p>
<p>was attached to it as printer.

<p>MR. CHARLES VERNON CALLED AND EXAMINED.

<p>Held the situation of registrar of newspapers in
</p>
<p>the Stamp-office ; it was in his ofiice that the de-
</p>
<p>clarations made by the proprietors and publishers
</p>
<p>of newspapers were lodged ; the newspapers tliem-
</p>
<p>selves are also lodged there as published ; he had
</p>
<p>here the declaration of Mr. Barrett, as proprietor of

<p>the Pilot (.declaration produced) ; he had seen Mr.

<p>EXAMINATION OF MR. J. S. COOPEK.
</p>
<p>237
</p>
<p>gworn before me on the 18th of November, 1842;
</p>
<p>saw it signed by Mr. Duffy ; the declaration now
</p>
<p>handed to me is that of the Freemati's Journal, and
</p>
<p>was signed by Dr. Gray, Dr. Atkinson, and Edward
</p>
<p>Duffy, on the 8th of February, 1841 ; Mr. Barrett's
</p>
<p>declaration was signed in my presence on the 8th
</p>
<p>of December, 1837.
</p>
<p>CROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. WHITESIDE.
</p>
<p>I have a commission, but it is not here ; can't say
</p>
<p>that I know Mr. Dufiy.
</p>
<p>Ah ! why did you not tell me that before ? How,
</p>
<p>then, can you swear to his handwriting ? I know
</p>
<p>that the party whose signature is affixed to that de-
</p>
<p>claration signed it before me ; he was present when
</p>
<p>he signed it (laughter).
</p>
<p>I am obliged to yon for that information, sir. You
</p>
<p>don't know Mr. Duffy ? No, sir.
</p>
<p>Thauk you, sir, that will do (laughter).
</p>
<p>Do you read the repeal debates in the Evening
</p>
<p>Mail? Sometimes, perhaps, I do, but very sel-
</p>
<p>dom.
</p>
<p>Do J'OU read the Nalion or the Freeman s Jour-
</p>
<p>nal ? No, the only paper I read is Saunders, in the
</p>
<p>mornings.
</p>
<p>Ha ! you patronize frigid Saunilert, do you (laugh-
</p>
<p>ter) ? Sometimes I do.
</p>
<p>The repeal debates appeared in that paper as in
</p>
<p>every other paper, and yet you see they have se-
</p>
<p>lected some other journals for a conspiracy (laughter) .
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside submitted that there was no parti-
</p>
<p>cular evidence of the publication, and in criminal
</p>
<p>cases the rulesof evidence should be strictly observed.
</p>
<p>The signature should be proved by some one who
</p>
<p>knew Mr. Duffy.

</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  The newspaper was pub-
</p>
<p>lished in Dublin under the terms of the act of par-
</p>
<p>liament, and there is a heavy penalty imposed on any
</p>
<p>person publishing a newspaper, without lodging the
</p>
<p>proper certificate that certified his bail, produced
</p>
<p>from the Stamp- office, the place where it ought to
</p>
<p>be. Under these circumstances, the question for
</p>
<p>the consideration of the court was  whether the
</p>
<p>certificate signed by this gentleman in the presence
</p>
<p>of the proper officer, and who represented himself
</p>
<p>as Charles Gavan Duffy, and by whom the paper was
</p>
<p>since regularly published, was not prima facie evi-
</p>
<p>dence; and some of the witnesses for the crown
</p>
<p>proved that Mr. Duffy, as editor and proprietor of
</p>
<p>that paper, attended at the meetings. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General then read the 8th section of the news-
</p>
<p>paper act, 6th and 7th William the Fourth, and sub-
</p>
<p>mitted that, under its terms, the evidence offered
</p>
<p>was admissible.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin  Can't you prove the hand- writing,
</p>
<p>and get rid of the argument.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The rule of law is the same in civil
</p>
<p>and criminal cases.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin Sure Mr. Cooper said that Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy signed the declaration.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  My lords, the first newspaper
</p>
<p>published by the proprietor of tlie Nation is dated
</p>
<p>the 8th of October, and the document Mr. Cooper
</p>
<p>proved is dated the 18th of November, so that it
</p>
<p>cannot be the right document.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster cited the case of Mayne v. Fletcher,
</p>
<p>in 9th Barnwell and Cresswcll, page 382, and con-
</p>
<p>tended that, inasmuch as the title of the newspaper
</p>
<p>corresponded with that set forth in the declaration
</p>
<p>2S8
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TJBIALS.
</p>
<p>is eonfclTRively bound by the act of parliament 
</p>
<p>which Of the two is the evidence against ?
</p>
<p>SoUci tor- General  Against either.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  If it be evidence against
</p>
<p>eitlier, you might have the two tnen convicted on the
</p>
<p>two indictments, upon the same paper, on which it
</p>
<p>was alleged only one was the proprietor. In my
</p>
<p>opinion very slight evidence, in addition to the sta-
</p>
<p>tutable evidence, is required. For my own part, I
</p>
<p>have no difficulty in point of fact, for I find on my
</p>
<p>notes, in the first instance, Mr. Dufly described by
</p>
<p>a witness, who was very fully and very ably cross-
</p>
<p>examined, as being the editor of the Nation. I think
</p>
<p>that Mr. Wliiteside is right on the ground he takes 
</p>
<p>that something m addition to the statutable evi-
</p>
<p>dence is required.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  The court is not to infer that
</p>
<p>a person has been carrying on the Nation as Charles
</p>
<p>Gavan Duffy, the person being actually another
</p>
<p>person.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin The question is, whether this
</p>
<p>is that Charles Gavan Duffy. It is not denied that
</p>
<p>some Charles Gavan Duffy is publisliing the Nation,
</p>
<p>but the question is, whether the traverser here is he.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  I tliink you will find that
</p>
<p>Jackson, in his evidence, said " Mr. Duffy of the
</p>
<p>Nation,"
</p>
<p> Mr. Wliiteside We understood that to be proof
</p>
<p>that Mr. Duffy was a member of the association, and
</p>
<p>nothing more.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton thought that was a scintillo
</p>
<p>of evidence that he was the editor of the Nation.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan said he would suppose that there
</p>
<p>were two Mr. Duffys at the bar, and tlien should it

</p>
<p>not be proved which of them was the proprietor ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson, the reporter, had not stated that Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy was the proprietor of the Nation, but that Mr.
</p>
<p>Duffy had handed in money. He would not say
</p>
<p>that the traverser was not identified, but he was not
</p>
<p>identified as having signed the certificate. If two
</p>
<p>Duffys were at the bar, clearly one should be identi-
</p>
<p>fied ; and that lias applied equally in this case,
</p>
<p>where the witness had not identified Duffy as the
</p>
<p>proprietor.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said he was not satisfied that
</p>
<p>the crown had given sufficient evidence of identity
</p>
<p>in the case. At that stage the evidence was im-
</p>
<p>perfect.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett said he thought the act of parliament
</p>
<p>was sufficiently plain to render discussion unneces-
</p>
<p>sary.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said the point did not come
</p>
<p>within the meaning of the act. In the case before
</p>
<p>the court proof was required that Mr. Duffy was the
</p>
<p>proprietor. The act requires that he and his pub-
</p>
<p>lisher should sign a declaration. They had signed
</p>
<p>it, and, if nothing more was required by the act,
</p>
<p>that declaration would be evidence against any per-
</p>
<p>son signing it as proprietor or pubUsher. That was
</p>
<p>a document by which the party was bound. But,
</p>
<p>to prevent any difficulty, the 8th section contained
</p>
<p>another provision  enabling evidence to he given
</p>
<p>against the proprietor or publisher in a summary
</p>
<p>way ; and that evidence was the certificate signed
</p>
<p>by the proper officer of the Stamp-office, and if he
</p>
<p>had been there to give evidence in place of Mr.
</p>
<p>Cooper, all might be right. The act provided, that
</p>
<p>upon producing a copy of that document, certified
</p>
<p>EXAMINATION OF MB. CHARLES VERNON.

<p>239
</p>
<p>dmcladed with a quotation from Dr. Arnold's
</p>
<p>" liCctures on History."
</p>
<p>Mr. Wliiteside asked the witness to turn also to
</p>
<p>the report of the proceedings of the association in
</p>
<p>the same paper, and to read them.
</p>
<p>Witness did so The speech of Mr. O'Conneli
</p>
<p>was in support of a resolution for inserting on the
</p>
<p>ininutes the letter of Mr. Smith O'Brien contain-
</p>
<p>ing the resignation of his commission of the peace
</p>
<p>for the county Limerick. He spoke in high terms
</p>
<p>of Mr. O'Brien, who he stated was the most inde-
</p>
<p>pendent member of parliament, while his arguments
</p>
<p>in favour of repeal were unanswerable. The speech
</p>
<p>also contained a strong expression by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>neli of his wish that in all regulations between land-
</p>
<p>lord and tenant the rights of property, &c., should
</p>
<p>he respected. As the witness lowered his voice dur-
</p>
<p>ing the reading, Mr. Whiteside directed him to read
</p>
<p>the speech as well as he had read the leading ar-
</p>
<p>ticle (laughter). Mr. Steele's speech on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion was omitted for want of space, and the resolu-
</p>
<p>tion as to Mr. O'Brien's letter was carried. Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Conneli then addressed the meeting, condemning
</p>
<p>the conduct of the Chartists in England, and advising
</p>
<p>the repealers of Ireland to expel them from their
</p>
<p>associations, and have nothing whatever to do with
</p>
<p>them. The speech then proceeded to allude to the
</p>
<p>unequal state of the parliamentary franchise in both
</p>
<p>countries, and expressed an apprehension that in a
</p>
<p>few years there would be no such thing as a liberal
</p>
<p>constituency in Ireland. It then alluded in denun-
</p>
<p>ciatory terms to the poor law amendment bill, and
</p>
<p>called upon the people to unite peacefully and con-
</p>
<p>Btitutionally to obtain redress for their grievances.

<p>as he expected to be asked to read no farther, but

<p>of the association.
</p>
<p>The witness then read the address at length, and
</p>
<p>having come to that portion of the report which
</p>
<p>stated that Mr. O'Couuell moved the adoption of
</p>
<p>the report,
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn respectfully submitted that if the crown
</p>
<p>gave in evidence any document, and read only part
</p>
<p>of it, they had a right to have it all used as evidence
</p>
<p>for the crown. Tliis was laid down in Philips upon
</p>
<p>Evidence, 5th Carrington and Payne, page 238 ; and
</p>
<p>in 7th Carrington and Payne, page 386, the very
</p>
<p>point was decided. These authorities, he con-
</p>
<p>tended, established that the whole of the docu-

<p>ment Avas clearly made evidence  it was made evi-
</p>
<p>dence for the party who produced it.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin asked Mr. Henn if he recollected
</p>
<p>the case of the King v. Perry ? He knew it was de-
</p>
<p>cided in that case that the advertisement in a re-
</p>
<p>mote part of the paper could be read in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  I do not know if that case had refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the other party or not.

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>traversers are entitled to have the document read
</p>
<p>over from the first to the last syllable, as far as it
</p>
<p>bore upon the subject at issue. This conduct was
</p>
<p>like putting a question to a witness, and because the
</p>
<p>answer happened to he a long one, stopping him be-
</p>
<p>fore he told all. This was not done for any good
</p>
<p>purpose. If it could be read in full upon cross-
</p>
<p>examination was it not evidence then : and what did
</p>
<p>they contend about the time of reading for ? Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly for the purpose of making au unfair impres-
</p>
<p>sion on the jury, by directing their minds to parti-
</p>
<p>cular portions of it, and then leaving it to counsel
</p>
<p>for the traversers to obliterate it if they could.
</p>
<p>This was their plain object, but he would strip off
</p>
<p>the covering and exhibit it in all its stark rank de-
</p>
<p>formity. There was a strict analogy between that
</p>
<p>newspaper and a witness. He had a right to all in
</p>
<p>that paper, as he would have a right to every fact
</p>
<p>within the knowledge of a witness. What he could
</p>
<p>get out from a witness upon cross-examination was
</p>
<p>the testimony of the crown, not of the traversers ;
</p>
<p>and when they placed a witness in the chair he was
</p>
<p>there to depose to all he knew. They should read the
</p>
<p>whole of that document, that its contents might be
</p>
<p>put fairly, and not in a garbled form before the jury.
</p>
<p>Why did they stop short when they came to the
</p>
<p>portions favourable to the traversers? He did not
</p>
<p>contend that he had a right to call for the adver-
</p>
<p>tisements to be readi The examination of a witness
</p>
<p>ought to be confined to the issuse, and if departed
</p>
<p>from, it should only be to try the credit of a wit-
</p>
<p>ness. They had no right to stop short when they
</p>
<p>pleased. It was for the crown to interpose when
</p>
<p>anything was offered to be read which was not per-

<p>tinent to the issue.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan said that the ease cited by the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General from Adolphus and Ellis had nothing
</p>
<p>to do with the present one. In that instance a book
</p>
<p>was offered in evidence which contained a number of
</p>
<p>letters written at different times. One party wanted
</p>
<p>to read one letter from that book, and it was con-
</p>
<p>tended on the other side that the whole series should
</p>
<p>be read, and the decision was against reading the
</p>
<p>whole, upon the grounds that the letters were writ-
</p>
<p>ten upon different days. If Mr. Vernon had brought
</p>
<p>a whole volume of the Naiinn newspaper, they could
</p>
<p>not call for the reading of every paper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Do you contend that all
</p>
<p>contained in the newspapers is evidence ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan  I contend that everything bearing
</p>
<p>upon tlie question at issue should be read. This was
</p>
<p>decided in the Morning Chronicle, the liing u. Perry.
</p>
<p>In that case, which was one of libel, contained in an
</p>
<p>article, a different paragraph was allowed to be read,
</p>
<p>explaining and modifying the matter contained in the
</p>
<p>article. As far as appeared from the report of the
</p>
<p>case, it seems the evidence was given on the part of
</p>
<p>the crown. The case was reported in the 2d Camp-
</p>
<p>bell, page 398.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Was the paragraph ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to be read relevant to the offence with which
</p>
<p>the individual is charged ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan  It was relevant to the offence
</p>
<p>charged. The offence there was a libel, and the pa-
</p>
<p>ragraph allowed to be read was in different tj'pe
</p>
<p>from the article containing the libel.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  The question is, whether one
</p>
<p>article explains or modifies the other, or whether it

</p>
<p>the crown. The article in itself was perfectly com-
</p>
<p>plete and distinct, and the whole of it was read by
</p>
<p>the crown. On another occasion, after an interval
</p>
<p>of some days, at a meeting of the association, a
</p>
<p>speech was made by one of the traversers and re-
</p>
<p>ported in another part of tliat same Nation newspa-
</p>
<p>per, apparently having no connection with, or re-
</p>
<p>quiring no qualification of, the opinions published
</p>
<p>in the iVad'on on the subject of "The mor.ality of
</p>
<p>war." Now, let it be supposed that speecli, instead
</p>
<p>of having been made by Mr. O'Connell, was spoken
</p>
<p>by Mr. Duffy himself, at that meeting of the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, could it be said that he would have been
</p>
<p>entitled to have the wliole of it read, though he was
</p>
<p>unable to show its connection with the publication
</p>
<p>of an .article entitled "The morality of war?"
</p>
<p>Tliere .appeared, .as his lordship conceived, no case
</p>
<p>bearing in support of the proposition now advanced
</p>
<p>by the traversers ; and if he had been called upon to
</p>
<p>decide, he should have great doubts as to whether
</p>
<p>the traversers, without the consent of the crown,
</p>
<p>would have a right to have a distinct independent
</p>
<p>publication read at all. However, the crown made
</p>
<p>uo objection to the speech being read, as well as the
</p>
<p>publication " The morality of war." It was, there-
</p>
<p>fore, not necessary at all for the court to decide,
</p>
<p>whether if tlie objection had been made the court
</p>
<p>would or would not have yielded. It had been said
</p>
<p>the question w.os, by whom the speech was read.
</p>
<p>The court were of opinion tliat it had been read by
</p>
<p>the traversers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton concurred with the Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice, and in support of his opinion cited
</p>
<p>the case of the King v. Perry, in which Lord Ellen-

<p>borough had laid down that although in a newspa-
</p>
<p>per which had an article the subject of a prosecution,
</p>
<p>there was a second article h.aving no reference to the
</p>
<p>former, yet there were cases in wliich that second
</p>
<p>article might be re.ad. But supposing sui^h a case to
</p>
<p>be well founded it would be a case in which a ques-
</p>
<p>tion would arise as to the intention of the writer to
</p>
<p>be decidetl from the article the subject of the prose-
</p>
<p>cution. The second article might then be introduced
</p>
<p>for the purpose of having the jury understand what
</p>
<p>were the motives and intentions of tlie writer in the
</p>
<p>article the subject of tlie prosecution. Supposing
</p>
<p>th.at doctrine to be well founded, then arose an im-
</p>
<p>portant question  which was the only question on
</p>
<p>which they had to give any opinion  whose evidence
</p>
<p>was that speech to be considered ? He (Judge
</p>
<p>Crampton) was of opinion that the traverser had
</p>
<p>made it his in evidence on this trial.
</p>
<p>Judge Perriu said that in this case the question,
</p>
<p>as it appeared to him, was simply this :  A printed
</p>
<p>newspaper had been given in evidence on part of the
</p>
<p>prosecution, from which an article was re.ad for the
</p>
<p>purpose of showing that the traverser who published
</p>
<p>that paper entert<ained the intention and object of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy charged in the indictment, and it was
</p>
<p>offered as evidence of such intention having been
</p>
<p>held by him. In no other jioint of view could it be
</p>
<p>looked upon as evidence ; and having been intro-
</p>
<p>duced in this case by tlie crown, the traverser then
</p>
<p>called upon the officer of the court to read another
</p>
<p>portion of the same publication  a distinct article,
</p>
<p>not referring to the former  but which he main-

<p>Mr. BourneI liave it. " We have referred the

<p>Mr. Whiteside I must ask you to read a passage
</p>
<p>for me, which, according to the decision of the

<p>court, will be part of my evidence. If you allow

<p>Mr. Brewster Stop for a moment, Mr. Bourne.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside It is quite the same to me whe-

<p>ther you will read it now or hereafter.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General concurred it was better for
</p>
<p>the crown read all the iiaragiaphs which they re-
</p>
<p>quired to have read in the first instance, and then

<p>the defendants would be at liberty to read such pa-

<p>ragraphs as they thought it necessary to have read.

<p>Mr. Whiteside  Just as you please, Mr. Attorney.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said that it any particular
</p>
<p>part was proposed to be read by the defendants, in
</p>
<p>qualification of what was read by the crown, they
</p>
<p>were entitled to read it at present, but if it be sub-
</p>
<p>stantive matter the regular course was to have their
</p>
<p>case stated in the first instance, and then let those
</p>
<p>passages be read as part of their evidence. How.
</p>
<p>ever, they would now go on, and when the time came

<p>the court would decide as to the period to read it.

<p>Mr. Henn  Would it not be more convenient to
</p>
<p>read the entire before you go to another paper. It
</p>
<p>was the course adopted in all the cases referred to.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  It certainly would be more
</p>
<p>convenient to dispose of each paper at once.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside Go to page 692, Mr. Bourne, be-
</p>
<p>ginning with the words  " there was another sub-
</p>
<p>ject relating to the north."
</p>
<p>Mr. Bourne then read from the paper as follows:
</p>
<p>" Mr. O'Connell said, there was another sub-
</p>
<p>ject relating to the north which he was anxious to
</p>
<p>have canvassed there. He found a disposition there
</p>
<p>amongst the repealers to accept battle from the
</p>
<p>Orangemen; thev thought it was shrinking on their
</p>
<p>part to avoid the challenges that were thrown out
</p>
<p>to them, and he thought that even in Belfast there
</p>
<p>was too much readiness on the part of the Catholics
</p>
<p>there to join in a contest with the Orangemen.
</p>
<p>The Orangemen certainly commenced it, but that
</p>
<p>was not a justification at all for the repealers in the
</p>
<p>north, who should avoid any contest or collision
</p>
<p>with their opponents. He warned them against
</p>
<p>retaliating, even when attacked, except in the neces-
</p>
<p>sary defence of life. Let them recollect the asso-
</p>
<p>ciation would give them an opportunity of legal
</p>
<p>vindication ; and every person must be satisfied
</p>
<p>with the way Judge Perrin and the jury tried the
</p>
<p>cases at Carrickfergus. The verdict was proper
</p>
<p>against both Orangemen and Catholics ; and the
</p>
<p>law that protected the Catholics when they were
</p>
<p>wrong, would doubly protect them when they were
</p>
<p>right ; and from that spot he promised legal pro-
</p>
<p>tection to every repealer in the north who did not
</p>
<p>retaliate when attacked, but quietly put up with

</p>
<p>making that avowal efficacious (hear and cheers").
</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford could not stand higher in any man's
</p>
<p>estimation than he did in his ; but still he thought
</p>
<p>it was somewhat a lame and impotent conclusion
</p>
<p>that he had come to in not joining them (hear).
</p>
<p>He admitted that they had opened the door to re-
</p>
<p>ceive him and men of his opinion ; but he alleged
</p>
<p>what he (Mr. O'Connell) thought a strange reason,
</p>
<p>at the same time tliat he respected the man and
</p>
<p>anything coming from him, that tliere may be
</p>
<p>formed a party in Ireland for a federal union, and
</p>
<p>that as that association was decidedly for a complete
</p>
<p>repeal and a complete restoration of an independent
</p>
<p>parliament in Ireland (hear, hear, hear); the time
</p>
<p>might come when he would arbitrate between the
</p>
<p>two parties, and conciliate both. That appeared to
</p>
<p>be worse than waiting until the stream would flow
</p>
<p>by, for the stream was not yet even in existence at
</p>
<p>alK There must be first established some associa-
</p>
<p>tion for a federal union, and he did not know how
</p>
<p>it was to be called into existence ; and when it was
</p>
<p>to be drawn up to something like manhood, then
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharman Crawford was to stand by and unite
</p>
<p>it in holy wedlock ^vith the repeal association. He
</p>
<p>respected liim even in his mistake ; but he still more
</p>
<p>respected him for the rest of his letter, which re-
</p>
<p>lated to the question of fixity of tenure ; or, as he
</p>
<p>preferred to call it ' equitable tenure,' for he thought
</p>
<p>it was a better phrase than fixity of tenure. Equit-
</p>
<p>able tenure implied that they regarded the rights
</p>
<p>of the landlord as well as of the tenant (hear).
</p>
<p>Mr. Sharman Crawford was the first person to come
</p>
<p>forward to protect the tenantry, and to bring their

</p>
<p>case before parliament ; and he was the first to
</p>
<p>propose any rational scheme for the alleviation
</p>
<p>of the misery which they now suffered (hear). The
</p>
<p>present law between landlord and tenant could not
</p>
<p>continue to exist ; it was impossible it could exist,
</p>
<p>for it would become insufferable. It would create a
</p>
<p>Sanguinary outbreak, and end in the destruction of
</p>
<p>property at every side (hear). Even in England the
</p>
<p>coBduct of the landlords was felt, and had attracted
</p>
<p>attention, and Lord Tortman had brought in a bill
</p>
<p>to give the tenant compensation for improvements.
</p>
<p>It was accompanied by details to which he need not
</p>
<p>now refer, which rendered it valueless if those details
</p>
<p>were not ameliorated, and he mentioned it now
</p>
<p>merely to show that the subject had had made an
</p>
<p>impression on the public mind. The Irish landlords,
</p>
<p>besides, had advantages over their tenants that the
</p>
<p>English landlords had not. There were more acts
</p>
<p>of parliament made to facilitate the landlords in Ire-
</p>
<p>land in exacting the highest rent from the tenant,
</p>
<p>than in England and Scotland (hear). Mr. Shar-
</p>
<p>man Crawford had brought forward his bill, and he
</p>
<p>(Mr. O'Connell) would lay before the committee the
</p>
<p>copy he did him the honour to send him. He (Mr.
</p>
<p>O'C.) had received another copy himself, and the
</p>
<p>merits of the bill would be distinctly compared by
</p>
<p>them. Mr. Sharman Crawford had proposed that
</p>
<p>the tenant should receive a recompense for all his
</p>
<p>outlay, whether of money, or labour, or the land ;
</p>
<p>that is, that the improvements made by the tenant
</p>
<p>should be for the benefit of the tenant (hear, hear).
</p>
<p>He proposed a way to ascertain the value of the im-
</p>
<p>provement, and that was by a reference, in the first
</p>
<p>place, to the county engineer. If that did not prove

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>" By such conduct as this, the demand made by i
</p>
<p>Irishmen for the repeal of the union is justified. I |
</p>
<p>feel that the connection of the two countries is thus
</p>
<p>endangered by the continuance of bad and unjust
</p>
<p>legislation. I feel that some security must be given
</p>
<p>against such a system, or else the connection cannot
</p>
<p>last longer than till the opportunity shall arrive of
</p>
<p>breaking it ; or that, so long as it does last, if upheld
</p>
<p>by the physical power of England against the will
</p>
<p>of the people of Ireland, it can only tend to the
</p>
<p>weakness of Britain, and the wretchedness of Ire-
</p>
<p>land. I therefore desire to establish the permanence
</p>
<p>of the connection, by seeking for Ireland the secu-
</p>
<p>rity for her particular interests and her rights which
</p>
<p>she would derive from self-governinent by a repre-
</p>
<p>sentative body of her own ; whilst, at the same time,
</p>
<p>she would have her due weight in the concerns of
</p>
<p>the empire by a representation in the imperial legis-
</p>
<p>lature, and the connection sustained by that central
</p>
<p>authority. I think this would provide that security
</p>
<p>which Ireland demands for her local interests, whilst
</p>
<p>the connection with Britain would not be endangered
</p>
<p>by such an arrangement, and by relieving England
</p>
<p>from the responsibility which the local legislation
</p>
<p>for Ireland imposes, the causes of discontent would
</p>
<p>be removed, and thus the obstacles which at present
</p>
<p>e.xist to the creation of a kind feeling between the
</p>
<p>two countries would cease to operate. I think, then,
</p>
<p>this is a proposition which ouglit to be supported
</p>
<p>by Englishmen as well as Irishmen, as tending to
</p>
<p>promote the happiness, prosperity, and power of the
</p>
<p>united kingdom. I think that a bond of united
</p>
<p>action on this basis might be formed, which would
</p>
<p>include the friends of freedom of all parts of the

</p>
<p>empire. Englishmen and Irishmen might then pull
</p>
<p>together in the common cause of the rights of the
</p>
<p>people, on the grand principle that no laws should
</p>
<p>be made to bind the people of any part of the united
</p>
<p>kingdom, which were not made by the will of the
</p>
<p>people who were to obey them, as expressed by their
</p>
<p>real representatives. Now, it is perfectly clear th.at
</p>
<p>if a law be made for any separate portion of the
</p>
<p>united kingdom, by the power of an imperial majo-
</p>
<p>rity in the legislature, that law is not made by the
</p>
<p>representatives of that portion of the people who are
</p>
<p>to obey it and this principle is applicable to Scot-
</p>
<p>land as well as to Ireland, and every portion of the
</p>
<p>empire which requires separate legislation to any
</p>
<p>extent, should have a local body for that separate
</p>
<p>legisl.ation. The principle of self-government by
</p>
<p>representation should be carried out through every
</p>
<p>institution of the state ; and local taxation, whether
</p>
<p>in a parish, a county, or a town, should be imposed
</p>
<p>and managed, an.d the bye-laws affecting that locality
</p>
<p>enacted by a body representing the locality which
</p>
<p>that taxation or these laws affect, and the whole
</p>
<p>kept under control and regulation by the central
</p>
<p>power of the imperial representation. This, in my
</p>
<p>judgment, is the principle of the British constitu-
</p>
<p>tion  it is the principle of the corporate system. It
</p>
<p>is the only true foundation of all representative
</p>
<p>government. It is this legitimate principle which
</p>
<p>I desire to see extended to Ireland.
</p>
<p>Without entering into the causes of the interior
</p>
<p>condition of Ireland, when compared with England,
</p>
<p>as to wealth and improvement, it will not be denied
</p>

<p>me to seek the more extended measure, I neTcrthe-
</p>
<p>less still cling to the hope tliat wliat I consider the
</p>
<p>more beneficial arrangement may be effected. You
</p>
<p>refer to my words, and call upon me to join in the
</p>
<p>struggle of Ireland against insult and oppression.
</p>
<p>I am ready to do so in every constitutional form
</p>
<p>which shall not appear to commit me beyond the
</p>
<p>principle I have stated.
</p>
<p>" Under the circumstances which at present ex-
</p>
<p>ist in Ireland, and the great movement which you,
</p>
<p>sir, have under your control, it would be impolitic
</p>
<p>and presumptuous to attempt to press any propo-
</p>
<p>sition connected with local legislation which did not
</p>
<p>meet your concurrence. X shall not make such an
</p>
<p>attempt ; but if I can be the medium of harmonizing
</p>
<p>conflicting opinions, my best endeavours shall be di-
</p>
<p>rected to that purpose.
</p>
<p>" I have thought it necessary to enter so much at
</p>
<p>length into the repeal question. I cannot in this
</p>
<p>letter refer, as I should wish, to that other important
</p>
<p>subject noticed in yours  namely, the landlord and
</p>
<p>tenant question. I have introduced a bill, a copy
</p>
<p>of which, when printed, I shall take leave to for-
</p>
<p>ward to you ; but I wish it to be understood that I
</p>
<p>only consider this bill as an incipient step for one
</p>
<p>particular object, viz., Me obtaining compensation for
</p>
<p>improvements. I wish, in the first instance, to test
</p>
<p>the house on this one principle alone. There are
</p>
<p>other steps with regard to tenure, and the limita-
</p>
<p>tion of the powers of recovering rent, which I would
</p>
<p>desire to effect, but I think these matters should be
</p>
<p>attempted by separate bills. The principle of com-
</p>
<p>pensation for improvements is so manifestly just
</p>
<p>that there can be no motive for the refusing it, un-

<p>less the desire to continue the perpetration of injus-

<p>on the occasion of the second reading on the 9th of

</p>
<p>roneously stated in the newspaper reports), after
</p>
<p>which it will probably lie over till the next session ;
</p>
<p>and in the meantime, during the recess, I shall be
</p>
<p>exceedingly desirous to communicate with you, and
</p>
<p>receive your advice and assistance with reference to
</p>
<p>the improvements of which, I have no doubt, it

<p>Mr. Whiteside  There is another short letter that
</p>
<p>I wish to have read. It is the letter of the Irish
</p>
<p>representatives, that was commented upon in one or
</p>
<p>two of the speeches made by Mr. O'Connell. Shall
</p>
<p>he read it now, or shall it be read in the morning.
</p>
<p>Judge Crarapton  As it is short you may as well
</p>
<p>read it now.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  It is tolerably short, about three
</p>
<p>quarters of a coluimi.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  It is better wait until morning.
</p>
<p>[Ml-. Henn stated that Mr. Maunsell was in at-
</p>
<p>tendance, and would, if necessary, be in attendance
</p>
<p>in the morning. What occurred arose, he was sure,
</p>
<p>from misunderstanding. Sir. Maunsell felt hurt at
</p>
<p>the harsh language that he conceived had been
</p>
<p>used to him. He was quite ready to make an affi-
</p>
<p>davit that he had not the least intention of inter-
</p>
<p>fering with the high sheriff in the discharge of his

<p>duty, or to provoke him to a breach of the peace, or

<p>Mr. M'Evoy Gartlan (agent for Mr. Dufly) ap-
</p>
<p>plied to the court to grant his client permission to
</p>
<p>retire until two o'clock. The application was made
</p>
<p>on the grounds of Mr. Dufly's illness.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said it was not in the power of
</p>
<p>the court to make any order upon the subject ; but
</p>
<p>, it was for the Attorney-General to say whether he
</p>
<p>had any objection to such a course, and whether he
</p>
<p>would insist on having Mr. Dufly called upon his
</p>
<p>recognizance.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General intimated that it was not
</p>
<p>his intention so to do. He would not take any no-
</p>
<p>tice of Mr. Dufly's absence from court.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagan called upon the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>to read from the Nation of August 12, page 691, a
</p>
<p>letter addressed by the Irish members of parliament
</p>
<p>to the people of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown complied, and read the
</p>
<p>following address : 
</p>
<p>" TO THE PEOPLE OF OnEAT BRITAIN.
</p>
<p>"We, the undersigned representatives of Irish
</p>
<p>constituencies, impressed with earnest solicitude
</p>
<p>respecting the present state and future destiny of
</p>
<p>our country, and deeply sensible of its wrongs, and
</p>
<p>resolved to leave no effort untried to obtain their
</p>

</p>
<p>upon record our solemn remonstrance against the
</p>
<p>fatal policy which has alienated from your govern-

<p>of our fellow-countrymen.
</p>
<p>" Deep-rooted and increasing discontent pervades

</p>
<p>would have placed at'our commaud. Despairing of
</p>
<p>redress from the legislature, the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>now rely upon their own strength and resolution
</p>
<p>for the attainment of those rights which they have
</p>
<p>sought from parliament in vain.
</p>
<p>"The voice of the civilised world lays to your
</p>
<p>charge the guilt of having produced this exasperation
</p>
<p>of national feeling. For centuries our legislation
</p>
<p>and government have been suliject to your control :
</p>
<p>on you, therefore, lie the responsibility of having
</p>
<p>failed to secure the welfare and contentment of the
</p>
<p>Irish people.
</p>
<p>" Our social condition is replete with elements of
</p>
<p>disorder. The connection between landlord and
</p>
<p>tenant, deranged as it has been by a long course of
</p>
<p>vicious legislature, hurts that mutual confidence
</p>
<p>which is essential to the development of productive
</p>
<p>industry. The labouring population, unable to ob-
</p>
<p>tain employment, live habitually on the verge of
</p>
<p>extreme destitution. Notwithstanding our con-
</p>
<p>nection with a nation which boasts to be the weal-
</p>
<p>thiest, the most enlightened, and the most powerful
</p>
<p>in the world, our commerce, our manufactures, our
</p>
<p>fisheries, our mines, our agriculture, attest, by their
</p>
<p>languishing and neglected condition, the baneful
</p>
<p>effects of your misgovernment.
</p>
<p>"A church establishment is maintained for the
</p>
<p>exclusive benefit of one-tenth of the nation.
</p>
<p>" Our representation in the legislature is unjustly
</p>
<p>disproportionate to the population and resources of
</p>
<p>Ireland.
</p>
<p>" Our parliamentary franchises are wholly inade-
</p>
<p>quate to secure a true refection of the opinion of the

</p>
<p>The Glerk of the Crown continued to read the do-
</p>
<p>cument to its conclusion.
</p>
<p>Mr Sinyly then handed Mr. Vernon the Nalinn
</p>
<p>of the 26th of August, which he identified as having
</p>
<p>been lodged in his office, and which purported to be
</p>
<p>printed and published by Charles Gavan Duffy, at
</p>
<p>No. 12, Trinity-street.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown having been handed the
</p>
<p>paper, read from it the article entitled, " The Crisis
</p>
<p>is upon us," at page 7'28, and in the same number
</p>
<p>of the paper the article headed " The Irish Con-
</p>
<p>gress." When he had concluded the articles he
</p>
<p>asked if they required anything further to be read
</p>
<p>from that paper.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  No more from that paper.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Hagau  Read page 726, in the third column
</p>
<p>of that paper.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said he wished to interpose.
</p>
<p>On the preceding day he felt disinclined to object to
</p>
<p>the reading of certain passages at that stage of the
</p>
<p>proceedings by the traversers, but in consequence of
</p>
<p>the course adopted in the reading of Mr. Sharman
</p>
<p>Crawford's letter, and the resolutions of the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of parliament, and other matter which had no
</p>
<p>bearing on the documents read by the crown, he
</p>
<p>wished the case should take the ordinary course.
</p>
<p>The crown wished to close within a reasonable time,
</p>
<p>and would be enabled to do so by being permitted
</p>
<p>to read the important parts for the prosecution, and
</p>
<p>when the traversers came to make their case they
</p>
<p>could oflFer such evidence as they would consider
</p>
<p>bearing on the issue.

<p>Mr. flatchell, Q C, said on the part of his client,

<p>traversers, in consequence of what had taken place
</p>
<p>the day hefore, and fully acquiesced in by the
</p>
<p>crown, they were certainly extremely surprised that
</p>
<p>there should be any departure from what they con-
</p>
<p>sidered the fixed arrangement respecting the read-
</p>
<p>ing of the papers. The counsel for the traversers
</p>
<p>had made their arrangements under the impression
</p>
<p>that that would be the course acted upon. If the
</p>
<p>objection was to have been taken at all, it ought to
</p>
<p>have been taken when Mr. Whiteside called for the
</p>
<p>reading of the letter of Mr. Sharman Crawford.
</p>
<p>The traversers' counsel considered that the matter
</p>
<p>had been sufficiently discussed, and tliat the opinion
</p>
<p>of the court, acquiesced in by the Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>was that the most convenient way for all parties,
</p>
<p>and particularly the court, to take the evidence on
</p>
<p>that part of the case, was that each of those news-
</p>
<p>papers should be read on the part of the crown 
</p>
<p>that then the portions which the traversers deemed
</p>
<p>necessary for their case should be read, and thus the
</p>
<p>court and jury would derive information relative to
</p>
<p>each publication, so that the matter would not be
</p>
<p>forgotten by them when it was taken up on a future
</p>
<p>occasion. He did not mean to say that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General intended to depart from his arrangement,
</p>
<p>but certainly it would embarrass the course to be
</p>
<p>taken by the traversers, and be unfair and unjust
</p>
<p>towards them in the conduct of their case hereafter.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said the court did not conceive
</p>
<p>that an arrangement of the nature mentioned by
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell had been entered into by both parties.
</p>
<p>He believed that arrangement was entered into on
</p>
<p>the day before, and it was considered at that time

<p>that that would be the most convenient way to have

<p>there is no fundamental principle of right whicli

<p>Mr. Carroll, Mr. Maxwell, Mr. P. S. Butler, Mr. J.

</p>
<p>Turn to the fifth page, and read Mr. O'Connell's

<p>The Clerk of the Crown accordingly read over the

<p>speech.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'DonoghTum to the third page, and read
</p>
<p>the commencement of the proceedings at the repeal

<p>demonstration of Kilkenny.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then read from the Pilot

<p>an account taken from the Kilkenny Journal and

<p>The Clerk then read the speech ; the following is

<p>an extract :  " Was it probable that the Irish people,

<p>after enduring centuries of persecution without being
</p>
<p>shaken in their loyalty, would now become disloyal

</p>
<p>throne ?" The health of his Royal Highness Prince
</p>
<p>Albert, the Prince of Wales, and the Princess Royal,
</p>
<p>were also given amid loud applause. Certain por-
</p>
<p>tions of an article from the Times newspaper on the
</p>
<p>state and condition of Ireland, and copied into the
</p>
<p>Pilot, were then read, together with the comments of
</p>
<p>the Pilot thereon. The Pilot of Wednesday, the I4th
</p>
<p>of June, was then put in, and tliat portion of it read
</p>
<p>describing the Liberator's entrance into Mallow, with

<p>tions from his speeches at the meeting and the dinner.

<p>an Orangeman, an extensive manufacturer, who
</p>
<p>heretofore had been strongly opposed to the repeal
</p>
<p>question, but he saw that under a foreign parliament
</p>
<p>our trade and manufactures were hourly wasting
</p>
<p>to decay. He (Mr. O'Connell) had told that gen-
</p>
<p>tleman that if he had the repeal the people would
</p>
<p>become so rich and comfortable that they would be
</p>
<p>able to buy his stockings in much greater quantities
</p>
<p>than they could now afford, for that every man in
</p>
<p>the community would have two pair of stockings
</p>
<p>for every pair of legs he had (laughter, and cheers) .
</p>
<p>And now he had something more to say to them in
</p>
<p>the way of caution and advice, and he was sure that
</p>
<p>they treasured up his words carefully, for the Irish
</p>
<p>people had ahrays regarded his counsel as a com-
</p>
<p>mand. One of the ingenious expedients to which
</p>
<p>the Orangemen of the north had recourse in the
</p>
<p>hope of damaging the repeal cause, was to employ
</p>
<p>miscreants going around through certain districts of
</p>
<p>the country, for the purpose of enticing the un-
</p>
<p>suspecting peasantry to jiet themselves sworn in as
</p>
<p>Eibbonmen. [A Voice  'I'll watch them the
</p>
<p>villains.'] Yes, watch them for me. Give all
</p>
<p>such scoundrels into the hands of the police, and
</p>
<p>you will be surprised to find how chagrined some of
</p>
<p>the police sergeants will be, when they find their
</p>
<p>own friends in a hobble. All illegal oaths naj',
</p>
<p>all secret and unnecessary oaths, were crimes ; and
</p>
<p>ruin, disgrace, exile, or death itself, might be the
</p>
<p>consequence of their becoming connected with a

<p>secret society. He was tremblingly alive to the
</p>
<p>vital importance of directing the attention of the
</p>
<p>people to this admonition, for he saw that victory

<p>was certain, if no unfortunate fatuity fell upon them,

<p>them by their wily and designing enemies."
</p>
<p>. From the same journal of the 14th was read the
</p>
<p>subjoined report of Mr. John O'Connell's speech at
</p>
<p>the Corn Exchange on the l'2th June : 
</p>
<p>" He also wished to announce from Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>that a precious panic appeared to have seized all the
</p>
<p>old women who constituted their opponents to such
</p>
<p>an extent, that it was desirable the repealers should
</p>
<p>not carry so much as green boughs in their hands.
</p>
<p>Of course they would, in every instance, leave their
</p>
<p>sticks at home. His father's wish was, that in every
</p>
<p>instance the repealers would follow the example ol
</p>
<p>the fine people of Kilkenny, who yielded at once to
</p>
<p>the request made of them  that they would not
</p>
<p>bring even a green branch in their hands to the
</p>
<p>meeting. There was also another subject to which
</p>
<p>he wished to allude, and though he had received no
</p>
<p>instructions from his father respecting it, still he
</p>
<p>knew he would but speak the sentiments which his
</p>
<p>father would use if he were present. It was with
</p>
<p>reference to the anti-repeal meeting that was to be
</p>
<p>held at the Rotundo, on Wednesday.* The repeal-
</p>
<p>ers should show them that they wereanxious to give
</p>
<p>every person, no matter what his sentiments might
</p>
<p>be, the fullest scope to speak his opinions openly,
</p>
<p>and above all, they were determined not to give the
</p>
<p>slightest pretence to any of their enemies for saying
</p>
<p>that they would, in the remotest degree, act in any
</p>
<p>manner that could lead to a breach of the peace.
</p>
<p>He would earnestly implore of the repealers ot
</p>
<p>Dublin, not only not to interrupt the proceedings at
</p>
<p>the Hotundo, but not to be present there at all, for
</p>
<p>the simple reason, that if they were present, and
</p>
<p>remained silent, they would give an importance to

</p>
<p>had no body to praise him, and therefore he praised
</p>
<p>himself. Neither he nor any of his class had done
</p>
<p>anything for Ireland. It may be asked what good
</p>
<p>he (Mr. O'Connell) had done. lie put down Pro-
</p>
<p>testant ascendancy  he took away the inferiority of
</p>
<p>the Catholics in point of law ; but Lord Wicklow
</p>
<p>had done nothing  he got rid of the old rotten cor-
</p>
<p>poration, and he was now struggling for repeal,
</p>
<p>which was really the poor man's question."
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon having concluded the speech,
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Do you see the name of Mr. Rielly
</p>
<p>there ? Yes ; Mr. Reilly seconded the resolution,
</p>
<p>which was put and carried.
</p>
<p>Now turn to the report of the dinner  to the toast
</p>
<p>of " Tlie People."

<p>Mr. Vernon  " The People, the source of all
</p>
<p>legitimate power."
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray spoke to the toast.
</p>
<p>Read Mr. O'Connell's speech at the dinner.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon then proceeded to read the speech of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell. One part of the speech referred to
</p>
<p>the often-discussed passage on the sergeants of the
</p>
<p>British army.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly told the witness to turn to the report
</p>
<p>of the dinner, and see if Mr. Steele was present.
</p>
<p>Mr. AVliiteside said that the paper could be
</p>
<p>no evidence as to whether Mr. Steele was present
</p>
<p>or not.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown said that Mr. Steele was
</p>
<p>mentioned in the report as having replied.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General rose to reply to what he
</p>
<p>understood was the objection, when
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside said he did not make any objection,
</p>
<p>he merely made the remark. He was not counsel

<p>for Mr. Steele.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General was not going to enter
</p>
<p>into the argument. All he wished was to be
</p>
<p>distinctly uiiderstood as not acquiescing in the
</p>
<p>objection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly called on the Clerk of the Crown
</p>
<p>to read a descriptive article on the Tara repeal
</p>
<p>demonstration, whicli appeared in the Pilot of
</p>
<p>August 16.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown read the article in ques-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Now read the report of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's speech at the Tara meeting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly requested the officer to read the names
</p>
<p>of the company ? I have them here.
</p>
<p>Do you see the name of John O'Connell, M.P.,
</p>
<p>amongst them ? I do.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  If you read any of the names
</p>
<p>read them all.
</p>
<p>The officer proceeded to comply with the request
</p>
<p>of the learned counsel, when
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh said, I do not require tliis, my
</p>
<p>lords.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  But Mr. Fitzgibbon does.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Not particularly ; but if one
</p>
<p>name be read all should be read.
</p>
<p>The officer, in reply to Mr. Smyly said he saw the
</p>
<p>name of Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Barrett, and Dr. Gray
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>Will you turn to the proceedings which took place

<p>Mr. Smyly  Now, take the Freeman's Journal of

<p>the 30th of May, and read Mr. O'ConncU's speech
</p>
<p>there at the Longford dinner.
</p>
<p>The Clerk read the following :

<p>" Mr. O'Connell rose, when the same unbounded
</p>
<p>scene of enthusiasm was repeated. When silence
</p>
<p>was at length restored, the hon. and learned gentle-
</p>
<p>man proceeded as follows :  I need not say your
</p>
<p>kindness is delightful to me. Your enthusiasm
</p>
<p>pleases me beyond the powers of expression, and
</p>
<p>the earnestness of your sympathy, not with my
</p>
<p>name but with my cause, for it is your cause, gives
</p>
<p>me the most exquisite delight. I saw the glorious
</p>
<p>scene of to-day, and it is strange. I am beginning
</p>
<p>to fear that those majestic meetings pall upon my
</p>
<p>sense by reason of their frequency. I have seen
</p>
<p>within the last ten days multitudes of ray fellow-
</p>
<p>countrymen beyond the power of enumeration, all
</p>
<p>concurring in one object, and all e.\pressing one de-

<p>determination, and it is time that determination
</p>
<p>should be expressed (cheers)  it is a determination
</p>
<p>that Ireland shall no longer be a pitiful province,
</p>
<p>but that she must be a nation (cheers). She pos-
</p>
<p>sesses all the features of a nation. Nature and na-

<p>may become a stipendiary magistrate, and the rich

</p>
<p>We have two-legged animals of that kind opposed

<p>to us, and I am glad of it, for I would not have my

<p>the only class that I could reckon on as being against

<p>posed to us, save a few from their prejudices may be

<p>kept aloof for the present ; but let it be recollected
</p>
<p>that we are working for them as well as for ourselves,
</p>
<p>and that we cannot get one advantage that they will
</p>
<p>not share in as much as we can. No, I am not
</p>
<p>afraid of any opposition from the Orange party. It
</p>
<p>is said, to be sure, that we are looking for a Catholic
</p>
<p>ascendancy, but a little reflection will convince them
</p>
<p>that we hated the ascendancy of their church too
</p>
<p>much to tarnish our own clergy by seeking the same

<p>ascendancy for thera. I am an old lawyer, and I

<p>have still the habits of ray profession about me, and

<p>am glad to have here in your two bishops, two wit-

</p>
<p>then he went on and assailed the Catholic priesthood,

<p>and said your were all liars. There's a Catholic

</p>
<p>as Henry Alexander was an Irishman. He had

<p>been chairman of ways and means in the Irish house

<p>us now complete the good work by cutting the
</p>
<p>throats of the Irish of our own party' (oh, oh) 1 It
</p>
<p>was matter of history, and could not be denied ; and
</p>
<p>the occasion at whicli it took place was the great
</p>
<p>battle of Knocktua, in the county of Galway. Lord
</p>
<p>Clifden, himself a Catholic, published a pamphlet,
</p>
<p>abusing the Irish bishops, as if he were their very
</p>
<p>fellow well met. There is no Irishman would act in
</p>
<p>such a manner. The priests here live in the hearts
</p>
<p>of the people ; and how many of them who are now
</p>
<p>listening to me know the truth of what I say ?
</p>
<p>Even when an Irish priest has the misfortune to fall
</p>
<p>from his high state, the people still acknowledge him
</p>
<p>not less than an archangel ruined ; they remember
</p>
<p>that he is the anointed priest of God; and, like the
</p>
<p>children of Noah, they take care to turn away their
</p>
<p>looks, as they cover the misery he has created (hear,
</p>
<p>and cheers). Yes ; we have the universal Irish na-
</p>
<p>tion swelling around us  we have the repeal wardens

<p>established in every parish throughout the land;
</p>
<p>and how delighted was I to-day at the pledge which
</p>
<p>you gave to my right reverend friend, that there
</p>
<p>would not be a parish in your diocese that would

<p>not have repeal wardens also.

<p>convinced of the truth that she could repose as much

<p>assassin, were to raise his murderous weapon against

<p>her Majesty while among the Irish nation, there was

<p>not an Irishman living who would not be rejoiced to

</p>
<p>there was not one who would not he ambitious to

<p>Mr. Bourne then read the proceedings at the

<p>Mr. Smyly  Go to the second column and read

<p>Ivhat Mr. Steele said.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown" Mr. Steele, iramediatelj'
</p>
<p>after Mr. O'Connell sat down, came forward, and, as
</p>
<p>a repeal warden of London, presented him with an
</p>
<p>address from the repeal wardens of London on the
</p>
<p>occasion of the triumphal result of the debate in the
</p>
<p>corporation on the repeal question, and concluded
</p>
<p>amid loud applause by moving that the address be
</p>
<p>inserted on the minutes. Town Councillor White
</p>
<p>seconded the motion, which was carried amidst ac-
</p>
<p>clamation. Mr. O'Connell then moved that his son
</p>
<p>Maurice, having declared himself ready to accept
</p>
<p>the office of inspector of repeal wardens for Munster,
</p>
<p>be appointed to that office, which motion was put
</p>
<p>and carried. Mr. Duffy handed in 21. from New-

</p>
<p>Coghlan and men as members."
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Now go to the fifth column, and
</p>
<p>you'll see a letter, read it.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown  " Mr. Ray read a letter
</p>
<p>from General Clooney. The letter contained a re-
</p>
<p>mittance of 6/. ; 5/. of which was the subscription of
</p>
<p>one hundred associates, and 1/. the personal sub-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>tholics were three times in power since the Reforma-
</p>
<p>tion, but he defied the most inveterate Orangeman
</p>
<p>to show an instance in which the Catholics passed a
</p>
<p>law for the persecution of Protestants. He begged
</p>
<p>the Protestants of Ireland to recollect that the ma-
</p>
<p>jority of the Irish house of lords would be Protest-
</p>
<p>ant ; out of 120 peers there would be scarcely 20
</p>
<p>Catholics, and how could they fear any persecuting
</p>
<p>law against them could pass in such a house. The
</p>
<p>house of commons would take care of Catholic
</p>
<p>rights  the house of lords of Protestant rights. He
</p>
<p>threw out these hints to the Protestant nobility and
</p>
<p>gentry  for in the moment of triumph he did wliat
</p>
<p>he would not do, when the repealers were weak.
</p>
<p>He implored of tliem to listen to him. The repeal-
</p>
<p>ers were strong now, and they were inclined to be
</p>
<p>humble towards their countrymen who differed from
</p>
<p>them, iind to implore their assistance, which they
</p>
<p>did not do while they were weak, that tlicy might
</p>
<p>take part in tlie agitation, and see it in all its de-
</p>
<p>tails ; and regulate it in such a manner that it could
</p>
<p>not possibly infringe on the rightof any Protestant,
</p>
<p>Presbyterian, or Dissenter in the kingdom. Let
</p>
<p>them come to him, so help him God, he would assist
</p>
<p>them. The present Lord Chancellor, in the interim
</p>
<p>of making out the writs of supersedeas for the re-
</p>
<p>peal magistrates, was very fond of investigating
</p>
<p>into the management of lunatic asylums, and made
</p>
<p>an agreement with the Surgeon-General to visit,
</p>
<p>without any previous intimation, a lunatic asylum
</p>
<p>kept by Dr. Duncan, in this city. Some person
</p>
<p>sent word to the asylum that a patient was to be
</p>
<p>sent there in a carriage that day, who was a smart
</p>
<p>little man, that thought himself one of the judges,

<p>or some great person of that sort, and wlio was to
</p>
<p>be detained there (laughter). Doctor Duncan was
</p>
<p>out, when Sir Edward Sugden came there in half an
</p>
<p>hour afterwards, and on knocking at the door he
</p>
<p>was admitted and received by the keeper. He ap-
</p>
<p>peared to be very talkative, but the attendants
</p>
<p>humoured him, and answered all liis questions. He
</p>
<p>asked if the Surgeon-General had arrived, and the
</p>
<p>keeper answered him that he was not yet come, but
</p>
<p>that he would be there immediately. ' Well,' said
</p>
<p>he, ' I will inspect some of the rooms until he ar-
</p>
<p>rives.' ' Oh, no, sir,' said the keeper, ' we could not
</p>
<p>permit that at all.' ' Then, I will walk for a while
</p>
<p>in the garden,' said his lordship, ' while I am wait-
</p>
<p>ing for him.' ' We cannot let you go there either,'
</p>
<p>said the keeper (laughter). ' But,' said he, 'don't
</p>
<p>you know that I am the Lord Chancellor?' 'Sir,'
</p>
<p>said the keeper, ' we liave four more Lord Chancel-
</p>
<p>lors here already' (laughter). Hs (Mr. O'C.) verily
</p>
<p>believed that tlie Chancellor caught the fury of su-
</p>
<p>perseding the magistrates while he was in Dr. Dun-
</p>

<p>nate if the rest of tlie ministry were there with him

<p>Mr. Close  Go to the report of the Longford
</p>
<p>meeting.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then re.ad the speech of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell proposing the health of the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Ardagh, and the speech of the bishop in returning
</p>
<p>thanks. The next health proposed was that of the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Meath, and the right rev. prelate in re-
</p>
<p>turning thanks said he cordially concurred in every

<p>expression used by the Bishop of Ardagh.

</p>
<p>Mr. Close  Turn to the speech of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>in reference to the letter of Mr. M'Kenna.
</p>
<p>Jlr. Vernon tlien read the passage:  " Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell was anxious to correct an error into which tlie
</p>
<p>writer seemed to have fallen. He supposed that
</p>
<p>the Nation was the organ of the association. There
</p>
<p>were many liber.al newspapers that published their
</p>
<p>proceedings, which the association respected ; but
</p>
<p>no paper was the organ of the association, nor was
</p>
<p>it to be held responsible for anything which ap-
</p>
<p>peared in any newspaper. He should be happy if
</p>
<p>he could prevail on the gentlemen of the press to
</p>
<p>publish Mr. M'Kenna's letter."
</p>
<p>The Freeman's Journal, of the 24th of August, was
</p>
<p>then put in, and the proceedings of the repeal asso-
</p>
<p>ciation of the preceding day were read. Jeremiah
</p>
<p>Dunn, Esq., was in the chair. At this meeting Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray brought forward a report of the sub-committee
</p>
<p>of tte appointment of the arbitrators. The report
</p>
<p>was read, and also Mr. O'Counell's address, express-
</p>
<p>ing his high approbation of the clear and able re-
</p>
<p>port ; it concluded with the names of the arbitrators
</p>
<p>appointed. The Pilot, of March 10th, was then put
</p>
<p>in, and the leading article, called "Repeal  Ame-
</p>
<p>rica," read.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown then read from the Pilot
</p>
<p>of the 10th of March, 1843, an article on repeal in
</p>
<p>America.

</p>
<p>port of Mr. Tyler's speech at the repeal meeting at
</p>
<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown read several extracts
</p>
<p>from the speech referred to.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh Tarn, if you please, to the 1st
</p>
<p>column of the fourth page of the same paper, and
</p>
<p>read the seventh resolution agreed to at a meeting
</p>
<p>of the house-painters.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown  The report is headed
</p>
<p>" Repeal Board of Trade." Is it not?
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Yes, it is. Read the seventh
</p>
<p>resolution, if you please.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown read the resolution
</p>
<p>referred to. The resolution alluded in the first
</p>
<p>instance to the injury whicli the trade had sustained
</p>
<p>in consequence of the union ; and they proceeded to
</p>
<p>observe, that previous to the year 1800 there were
</p>
<p>in Dublin 436 house-painters, who were kept in re-
</p>
<p>gular employment, and received excellent wages,
</p>
<p>whereas there were at present but 60, of whom a mere
</p>
<p>fractional number were able to procure employment,
</p>
<p>and even these were compelled to work for any
</p>
<p>wages they could get.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly then requested of Mr. Vernon to read
</p>
<p>from the Nation of April the 1st, the lines entitled
</p>
<p>" The Memory of the Dead."
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon read the poem in question.
</p>
<p>[Mr. Vernon read those verses with great effect,
</p>
<p>and when he had concluded a universal murmur of
</p>
<p>approbation pervaded the court. The reader will
</p>
<p>find the verses in the opening statement of the At-
</p>
<p>torney-Gener.al].
</p>
<p>The Clerk of tlie Crown continued to read " Mr.

<p>Charles Gavan Diifly said he had the pleasure of

</p>
<p>it oughtto be returned, and the names of the persons
</p>
<p>giving it struck off the list. He moved that Mr.
</p>
<p>Callaghan be dismissed, and that lie be no longer
</p>
<p>regarde<l as a member of the association. He also
</p>
<p>moved that the money be returned to those nineteen
</p>
<p>persons, and, tliat their names be taken off the list of
</p>
<p>repealers. This motion was seconded and carried.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh requested the officer to turn to the
</p>
<p>first column of the first page.
</p>
<p>This was done, and the requisition to Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell read to attend a meeting and dinner at Lough 
</p>
<p>rea, for the purpose of discussing the question of
</p>
<p>the repeal of the legislative union. The advertise-
</p>
<p>ment was signed by the Archbishop of Tuam, Lord
</p>
<p>Ffrench, Sir Valentine Blake, Bart. M.P., M.
</p>
<p>Blake, Esq. M.P., R. D. Browne, &c.
</p>
<p>The Pilot of the 25th of September was then put
</p>
<p>in, and the following leader read from it, entitled 
</p>
<p>"The Army, the People, and the Government."
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Turn to the next column, if you
</p>
<p>please, and read the article headed "Rumoured
</p>
<p>death of General Jackson."
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon read from the Pilot of the 23th Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, 1842, the article in question.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Have you got the Pilot of the 6th of
</p>
<p>October? Yes. Newspaper handed in.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Turn to the leading article in the se-
</p>
<p>cond page, headed " The Battle of Clontarf."
</p>
<p>The witness then read the article which described
</p>
<p>^nd commented on the battle.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Head the last sentence, and you may
</p>
<p>pass over the description of the battle.

<p>Mr. Smyly That'll do.
</p>
<p>Now take the Nation o( September 30, 1843, and
</p>
<p>read the advertisement headed "Repeal Cavalry."
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon lead the advertisement at length, as
</p>
<p>read in the opening statement of the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly  Look to an entry in the list of re-
</p>
<p>peal subscriptions in tl e A'a/ionof that date, in which
</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy's name is mentioned.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Ciown read the entry, which
</p>
<p>was a remittance of 45/. 16s. per Charles G. Duffy,
</p>
<p>editor of the Nation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside requested him to look to page 10
</p>
<p>in the Nation of the yd of September.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown referred to the page. It
</p>
<p>contained a letter, copied from the fVurder, signed
</p>
<p>by a gentleman, who said " he declined signing the
</p>
<p>Protestant Declaration, from the conviction that
</p>
<p>those who signed it were nut the real friends of the
</p>
<p>qountry. The distress of Ireland was such that re-
</p>
<p>peal or something of the kind was necessary to alle-
</p>
<p>viate her condition."
</p>
<p>[At this moment Mr. William Smith O'Brien, M.P.,
</p>
<p>came into court, and sat at the traversers' bar.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Smyly read the advertisement in the Freeman
</p>
<p>of October 3, 1843, headed " Repealers on Horse-
</p>
<p>back  Clontarf Meeting, Sunday, 8th October."
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon then read a report of the repeal as-
</p>
<p>sociation out of the Freeman's Journal of the 29th
</p>
<p>September, and also a list of subscriptions handed
</p>
<p>in on that occasion by Mr. Duffy; and out of the

<p>Pilot o{ the same date; he also read a list of sub-

</p>
<p>^59
</p>
<p>The Inspector of the Metropolitan Police at Kings-
</p>
<p>town had just come on the table after the last wit-
</p>
<p>ness had retired, when
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General immediately rose and said
</p>
<p>that the case for the crown had closed. It was then
</p>
<p>exactly half-past three o'clock.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, after a short pause, rose and said that
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell, who was to open the case on the part of
</p>
<p>the traversers, had been unwell for the last two or
</p>
<p>three days. He had been sent for to-day, and he
</p>
<p>stated that he had a slight attack of gout which
</p>
<p>confined him to his bed, but he would be able to at-
</p>
<p>tend to-morrow. Under these circumstances, and
</p>
<p>considering that it now approached four o'clock, and
</p>
<p>also considering the magnitude of tlie case, he trusted
</p>
<p>the court would wait and not press the case. It had
</p>
<p>been arranged amongst the counsel for the traversers
</p>
<p>that Mr. Slieil would open the case on the part of
</p>
<p>Mr. John O Connell, and it would disturb the ar-
</p>
<p>rangements if Mr. Sheil was not waited for.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said he thought the application
</p>
<p>was a very reasonable one.
</p>
<p>The trial was accordingly postponed^ and the
</p>
<p>court rose.

<p>SATORD.iv, January 27.
</p>
<p>The full court sat this morning precisely at ten
</p>
<p>o'clock. It being publicly known that the case for

<p>the crown had terminated, and that the Uisht Hon.
</p>
<p>R, L. Shell, Q.C. and M.P., was to open the case for
</p>
<p>the defence, the greatest an.viety was nianii'ested to
</p>
<p>secure places in the court. The ha 1 of the courts
</p>
<p>and the adjoining avenues were thronged to excess
</p>
<p>at an early hour. The interior presented a very

</p>
<p>striking appearance, and every part of it was crowdeil
</p>
<p>almost to inconvenience. Never on any occasion
</p>
<p>were there observed, at least in the metropolis, so
</p>
<p>m.iny elegantly-attired females in a court of justice.
</p>
<p>Many of the nobility, with their families then in
</p>
<p>town, who could procure admission, were present.
</p>
<p>Amongst the personages in court were the Countess
</p>
<p>of Dououghmore, Lady Sudden, .Mrs. J. Gray, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon, the Archbishop of Tuani, the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Ardagh, Mr. William Smith tCBrieu, M.P.. Uobert
</p>
<p>I). Browne, M.P.. and several other influential and
</p>
<p>popular gentlemen. When the judges had taken
</p>
<p>their seats the most death-like silence prevailed, and
</p>
<p>every eye was turned in the direction of the great
</p>
<p>orator and advocate who was to open the ease, and
</p>
<p>when he rose to address the jury we have never wit-
</p>
<p>nessed a more impressive or solenm scene, and never
</p>
<p>was expectancy so well sustained.
</p>
<p>MB. SBEIL, Q.C, IN DEFENCE OF MR. JOHN
</p>
<p>O'CONNELL.
</p>
<p>The Right Hon. gentleman spoke as follows : 
</p>
<p>May it please your lordships and gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, I am counsel for Mr. John O'Connell. The
</p>
<p>importance of this case is not susceptible of exagge-
</p>
<p>ration, and 1 do not speak in the language of hyper-
</p>
<p>bole when I say that the attention of the empire is
</p>
<p>directed to the spot in which we are assembled.
</p>
<p>How great is the trust reposed in you  how great
</p>
<p>is the task which I have undertaken to perform ?
</p>
<p>Conscious of its magnitude, 1 have risen to address
</p>
<p>you, not unmoved, but undismayed ; no  not un-
</p>
<p>moved  for at this moment how many incidents of
</p>
<p>my own political life come back upon me, when I
</p>
<p>look upon my great political benefactor, my deli-
</p>
<p>260

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>safety, should descend to the performance of func-
</p>
<p>tions worthy only of a commissary of the French
</p>
<p>police ; and in place of being the sentinel, should
</p>
<p>become the " Artful Dodger" of the state? But
</p>
<p>flrhat, you may ask, could be the motive of the right
</p>
<p>hon. gentleman for pursuing the course he has
</p>
<p>adopted, and for which no explanation has been
</p>
<p>attempted by him ? He could not have obtained any
</p>
<p>advantage signally serviceable to his party by pro-
</p>
<p>secuting Mr. Barrett, or Mr. Duffy, or Dr. Gray, for
</p>
<p>strong articles in their newspapers ; or by prosecu-
</p>
<p>ting Mr. Steele or Mr. Tierney, for attending unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful assemblies. He did not fish with lines  if I may
</p>
<p>avail myself of an illustration derived from the
</p>
<p>habits of ray constituents at Dungarvan  but cast a
</p>
<p>wide and nicely constructed trammel-net, in order
</p>
<p>that by a kind of miraculous catch he might take
</p>
<p>the great agitator-leviathan himself a member of
</p>
<p>parliament, Tom Steele, three editors of news-
</p>
<p>papers, and a pair of priests in one stupendous
</p>
<p>haul together. But there was another object still
</p>
<p>more important to be gained. Had the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General prosecuted individuals for the use of vio-
</p>
<p>lent language, or for attending unlawful meetings,
</p>
<p>each individual would have been held responsible
</p>
<p>for his own acts ; but in a prosecution for conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, which is open to every one of the objec-
</p>
<p>tions applicable to constructive treason, the acts
</p>
<p>and the speeches of one man are given in evidence
</p>
<p>against another, although the latter may have been
</p>
<p>at the distance of a hundred miles when the circum-
</p>
<p>stances used against him as evidence, and of wliich
</p>
<p>he had no sort of cognizance, took place. By pro-
</p>
<p>secuting Mr. O'Connell for a conspiracy, the Attor-

<p>ney-General treats him exactly as if he were the
</p>
<p>editor of the Freeman, the editor of the Nalim, and
</p>
<p>the editor of the Pilot newspapers. Indeed, if five
</p>
<p>or six other editors of newspapers in the country
</p>
<p>had been joined as traversers, for every line in their
</p>
<p>newspapers Mr. O'Connell would be held responsi-
</p>
<p>ble. There is one English gentleman, 1 believe,
</p>
<p>upon that jury. If a prosecution for a conspiracy
</p>
<p>were instituted against the anti-corn law league in
</p>
<p>England, would he not think it very liard indeed
</p>
<p>that Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright should be held an-
</p>
<p>swerable for every article in the Chronicle, in the
</p>
<p>Globe, and in the Sun ? How large a portion of the
</p>
<p>case of the crown depends upon this implication of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell with three Dublin newspapers? He
</p>
<p>is accused of conspiring with men who certainly
</p>
<p>never conspired with each other. For those who
</p>
<p>know anything of newspapers are aware that they
</p>
<p>are mercantile speculations  the property in them

<p>ask Mr. Rogers what manner of man was a Mr.

<p>repeal party. You would smile, I tliink, at the sug-
</p>
<p>gestion that Mr. Murray Mansfield and Mr. Remmy

<p>Those gentlemen would be themselves astonished at

<p>constitution. Gentlemen, it is my intention to
</p>
<p>show you that my client is not guilty of any of the
</p>
<p>conspiracies charged in the indictment ; and in doing
</p>
<p>so I shall have occasion to advert to the several pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings that have been adopted by the government,
</p>
<p>and to the evidence that has been laid before you.
</p>
<p>But before I proceed to that head of the division
</p>
<p>which I have traced out for myself, I shall show you
</p>
<p>what the object of my client really was; I shall show
</p>
<p>you tliat that object was a legal one, and that it was by
</p>
<p>legal means that he endeavoured to attain it. The
</p>
<p>Attorney- General, in a speech of considerable length
</p>
<p> ^l)ut not longer than the greatness of the occasion
</p>
<p>amply justified  adverted to a great number of di-
</p>
<p>versified topics, quoted the speeches of Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel and of Lord John Russell  adverted to the re-
</p>
<p>port of the secret committee of the house of lords in
</p>
<p>1797, and referred to the great era of Irish parlia-
</p>
<p>mentary independence, 1782. That he should have
</p>
<p>been so multifarious and discursive, I do not com-
</p>
<p>plain. In a case of this incalculable importance we
</p>
<p>should look for light wherever it can be found. I
</p>
<p>shall go somewhat farther than the year 1782 ; but do
</p>
<p>not imagine that I mean to enter into any lengthened
</p>
<p>narrative or elaborate expatiation. Long tracts of
</p>
<p>time may be swiftly traversed. I do not think that
</p>
<p>any writer has given a more accurate or more inte-
</p>
<p>resting account of the first struggle of Ireland for the
</p>
<p>assertion of her rights than Sir Walter Scott. He
</p>
<p>was a ITory. He was bred and born, perhaps, in
</p>
<p>some disrelish for Ireland ; but when he came
</p>
<p>amongst us, his opinions underwent a material al-
</p>
<p>teration. The man who could speak of Scotland in

<p>natives of England in'pkces of trust and emolument

<p>in Ireland ; of the dependence of that kingdom
</p>
<p>upon England, and the power assumed, contrary to
</p>
<p>.truth, reason, and justice, of binding her by the
</p>
<p>laws of a parliament in which she had no represent-
</p>
<p>ation." And, gentlemen, is it a question too bold of
</p>
<p>me to ask, whether if Ireland have no effective re-
</p>
<p>presentation  if the wishes and feelings of the re-
</p>
<p>.prcsentatives of Ireland upon Irish questions are
</p>
<p>held to be of no account  if the Irish representation
</p>
<p>is utterly merged in the English, and the minister
</p>
<p>does not, by a judicious policy, endeavour to coun-
</p>
<p>teract it  as he might, in the opinion of many men,
</p>
<p>effectually do  is not the practical result exactly
</p>
<p>the same as if Ireland had not asinglerepresentative
</p>
<p>in parliament ? Gentlemen, Swift addressed the
</p>
<p>pec.ple of Ireland upon this great topic, in langurge

</p>
<p>one or two interesting anecdotes, says  " When the

<p>with the sheep on condition of parting with their
</p>
<p>shepherds and mastiffs, after which they ravaged the
</p>

</p>
<p>to the citizens at large, and enforcing similar topics,
</p>
<p>are subscribed by the Draper's initials, and are
</p>
<p>doubtless Swift's own composition, alluding to the
</p>
<p>charge that he had gone too far in leaving the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of Wood's project to treat of the alleged de-

<p>At the same time was circulated the memorable and

<p>vented by our wretched religious distinctions from co-

</p>
<p>Fatal, disastrous, detestable distinctions ! Detesta-

</p>
<p>genuine spirit of Christianity, and substitute for the
</p>
<p>charities of religion the rancorous antipathies of

<p>Catholic are permitted to continue. In Germany,

<p>Chief Justice  If public feeling is exhibited again

<p>in this manner, or if the proceedings of the court

<p>are again interrupted, I must order the galleries to

</p>
<p>Mr. Shell, you do not wish it yourself.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell There is nothing I deprecate more,
</p>
<p>my lord ; for it is not by such means that the minds
</p>
<p>of the jury are to be convinced.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice  Certainly not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell  I am much obliged to your lordship

<p>for interrupting me, as it has given me a few mo-

</p>
<p>The right honourable gentleman thanked his lord-

<p>ship and resumed his address. It is indisputable
</p>
<p>that Ireland made a progress marvellously rapid in
</p>
<p>the career of improvement which freedom had
</p>
<p>thrown open to her ; she ran so fast that England
</p>
<p>was afraid of being overtaken. Mr. Pitt and Mr.
</p>
<p>Dundas concurred in stating that no country had
</p>
<p>ever advanced with more rapidity than Ireland.
</p>
<p>Her commerce and manufactures doubled ; the
</p>
<p>plough climbed to the top of the mountain, and
</p>
<p>found its way into the centre of the morass. Tliis

</p>
<p>am not to speak for belaud, but for the English in
</p>
<p>Ireland. . . . The members for Ireland and the
</p>
<p>electors are all Englishmen, who naturally claim to
</p>
<p>have votes in making laws by which they must be
</p>
<p>governed ; they have fought your battles, obtained
</p>
<p>and preserved your interests, designed by the fa-
</p>
<p>mous long parliament, obtained by blood, and sought
</p>
<p>for by prayer solemnly." You may ask of me,
</p>
<p>"iriierefore is it I make these references ? I answer,
</p>
<p>"because the institutions of a country may change ;
</p>
<p>the government may, in its form, undergo essential
</p>
<p>modifications ; but the basis of the national charac-
</p>
<p>ter, like its language, remains the same, and to
</p>
<p>this very day there prevails in the feelings of English-
</p>
<p>men towards this country what I have ventured to
</p>
<p>call elsewhere  theinstinct of domination. Toward.";
</p>
<p>the Protestants of Ireland, when the Papists were

</p>
<p>question is not one between Catholic and Protes-
</p>
<p>tant; but the question is between the greater coun-

<p>try and the smaller, which the greater country en-

<p>deavours to keep under an ignominious control.

<p>The tmion was carried by corruption and by fear.

<p>The shrieks of the rebellion still echoed in the na-

<p>country remained Incorruptible  Grattan, Curran,
</p>
<p>and the rest of those famous men, whose names cast
</p>
<p>so bright a light upon this, the brightest part of our
</p>
<p>history, never for a moment yielded to a sordid or
</p>
<p>ignoble impulse. All the distinguished men of the
</p>
<p>bar were faithful to their country. Sir Jonah Bar-
</p>
<p>rington, in his history of the rise and fall of the
</p>
<p>Irish nation, has quoted the speeches of the most
</p>
<p>eminent men of our profession ; amongst which
</p>
<p>those of Mr. Goold, who argued the question of
</p>
<p>right with equal eloquence and subtlety, Mr. Joy,
</p>
<p>Mr. Plunket, Mr. Bushe, and Mr. Saurin, are con-
</p>
<p>spicuous. Lord Plunket denied the right of par-
</p>
<p>liament to destroy itself. Mr. Saurin appealed to
</p>
<p>the authority of Mr. Locke. The same course was
</p>
<p>taken by Mr. Bushe, whom we have lost so lately
</p>
<p>Bushe, whom it was impossible for those by whom
</p>
<p>the noblest eloquence was justly prized not to ad-
</p>
<p>mire  whom it was impossible for those by whom
</p>
<p>the purest worth was justly estimated not to reve-
</p>
<p>rence ; and whom it was impossible for those by
</p>
<p>whom a most generous and exalted nature could be
</p>
<p>appreciated, not to love. The Attorney-General has
</p>
<p>stated that the opinions of these eminent persons,
</p>
<p>delivered at the time of the Union, ought to be
</p>
<p>held in no account. What reason did he give
</p>
<p>for not attaching any value to the authority of
</p>
<p>Mr. Saurin? He said Mr. Saurin expressed his
</p>
<p>opinions in mere debate. So that the most im-
</p>
<p>portant principles solemnly laid down in parliamen-
</p>
<p>tary debate are to be regarded as little better thau
</p>
<p>mere forensic asseveration. I can now account for
</p>
<p>some speeches which I heard in the house of com-
</p>
<p>mons regarding the education question. I think,

<p>were a continuation of martial law, and an extended
</p>
<p>suspension of the habeas corptis act. Mr. Pitt was
</p>
<p>honestly anxious to carrj' Catholic emancipation,
</p>
<p>and to make at the same time a provision for the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic clergy. You may  some of you
</p>
<p>may  perhaps, think that Catholic emancipation
</p>
<p>ought never to liave been carried ; but if it was to
</p>
<p>be carried, how much wiser would it have been to
</p>
<p>have settled it forty-four years ago, and without
</p>
<p>putting tlie country through that ordeal of excite-
</p>
<p>ment through which the imperial parliament, by
</p>
<p>the procrastination of justice, forced it to pass. Mr.
</p>
<p>Pitt, by transferring the Catholic question from the
</p>
<p>Irish to the imperial parliament, destroyed his own
</p>
<p>administration, and furnished a proof that, in place
</p>
<p>of being able to place Ireland under the protection of
</p>
<p>his great genius, he placed her under the control
</p>
<p>of the strong religious prejudices of the English
</p>
<p>people. Mr. Pitt returned to the first place in the
</p>
<p>ministry without, however, being able to make any
</p>
<p>stipulations for the fulfilment of liis own engage-
</p>
<p>ments, or the reaUzation of the policy wliich he felt
</p>
<p>to be indispensable for tlie peace of Ireland. The
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic question was brought forward in
</p>
<p>1805, and was lost in an imperial house of commons.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt died of the battle of Austerlitz, and was
</p>
<p>succeeded by the Whigs. They proposed a measure,
</p>
<p>which the Tories, wlio drove them out on the " No
</p>
<p>Popery" crj', carried in 1816, and then introduced
</p>
<p>the new doctrine, that the usefulness of public
</p>
<p>measures is to be tried far less by the principles on
</p>
<p>which they were founded, than by the parties by
</p>
<p>which they were accomplished. The expulsion of

<p>ment, have been a fortunate proceeding ; but for-
</p>
<p>tunate or unfortunate, it furnishes another proof
</p>
<p>that the government of Ii-eland had been made
</p>
<p>over, not so much to the parliament as to the great
</p>
<p>mass of the people by wliom that parliament is held
</p>
<p>under control. The Tories found in the portfolio of
</p>
<p>the Whigs two measures : a draft-bill for Catholic
</p>
<p>emancipation, which the Duke of Wellington, then
</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Secretary for Ireland,
</p>
<p>flung into the fire ; and an arms' bill, to wliich
</p>
<p>clauses have been recently added, wliich even Mr.
</p>
<p>Shaw declared were " wantonly severe." You may
</p>
<p>conceive that an arms' bill, with all its molestations,
</p>
<p>may be required ; but it is beyond question that, in
</p>
<p>the year 1819, when England was on tlic verge of a
</p>
<p>rebellion, no such bill was ever propounded by the
</p>
<p>British ministry ; and granting, for a moment, for
</p>
<p>the sake of argument, that some such bOl is re-
</p>
<p>quisite, how scandalously must a country have been
</p>
<p>governed for almost half a century, if this outrage
</p>
<p>upon the bill of rights be required ! Having passed
</p>
<p>tlie arms' bill and the insurrection act, its appro-
</p>
<p>priate adjunct, the imperial parliament proceeded to
</p>
<p>reduce the allowance to Maynooth. There is but
</p>
<p>one opinion regarding Maynooth, that it should be
</p>
<p>totally suppressed, or largely and munificently en-
</p>
<p>dowed, and that an education should be given to tlie
</p>
<p>Roman CathoUc clergy such as a body exercising
</p>
<p>such vast influence ought to receive ; there are some
</p>
<p>who think that it were better that the Catholic
</p>
<p>clergy were educated in France. I do not wish

<p>the order of Providence was disturbed, and its bless-
</p>
<p>ings worse than neglected ? Tlie fatal cause was
</p>
<p>obvious  it was the union. That those deplorable
</p>
<p>effects would follow from that accursed measure
</p>
<p>was prophesied. Before the act of iiniou passed, it
</p>
<p>had been already proved that the trade of the coun-
</p>
<p>try and its credit must fail as capital was drawn
</p>
<p>from it  that turbulence and violence would increase
</p>
<p>when the gentry were removed to reside in another
</p>
<p>country  tliat the taxes should increase in the same
</p>
<p>proportion as the people became unable to pay them !
</p>
<p>But neither the arguments nor the prophetic fears
</p>
<p>have ended with our present evils. It has also been
</p>
<p>demonstrated, that as long as the union continues
</p>
<p>so long must our evils accumulate. The nature of
</p>
<p>that measure, and the experience of fajts which we
</p>
<p>have now had, leave no doubt of the truth of what
</p>
<p>has been asserted respecting the future ; but, if
</p>
<p>there be any still uncredulous, he can only be of
</p>
<p>those who will not submit their reason to authority.
</p>
<p>To such persons the authority of Mr. Foster, his
</p>
<p>Majesty's Chancellor of the Kxchequer for Ireland,
</p>
<p>would probably be conclusive, and Mr. Foster has
</p>
<p>assured us that final ruin to our country must be
</p>
<p>the consequence of the union. I will not dwell, Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheriff, on the miseries of my country ; I am dis-
</p>
<p>gusted with the wretchedness the union has pro-
</p>
<p>duced, and 1 do not dare to trust myself with the
</p>
<p>contemplation of the accumulation of sorrow that
</p>
<p>must overwhelm the land if the union be not re-
</p>
<p>pealed. I beg to call the attention of the meeting

<p>to another part of the subject. The union, sir, was
</p>
<p>a violation of our national and inherent rights : a
</p>
<p>flagrant injustice. The representatives who we had
</p>
<p>elected for the short period of eight years had no
</p>
<p>authority to dispose of their country for ever. It
</p>
<p>cannot be pretended that any direct or express
</p>
<p>authority to that effect was given to them, and the
</p>
<p>nature of their delegation excludes all idea of their
</p>
<p>having any such by implication. They were the ser-
</p>
<p>vants of the nation, empowered to consult for its
</p>
<p>good i not its masters to traffic and dispose of it at
</p>
<p>their fantasy or for their profit. I deny that the
</p>
<p>nation itself had a right to barter its independence,
</p>
<p>or to commit political suicide ; but when our ser-
</p>
<p>vants destroyed our existence as a nation, the}' added
</p>
<p>to the baseness of assassination all the guilt of high
</p>
<p>treason. The reasoning upon which those opinions
</p>
<p>are founded is sufficiently obvious. They require
</p>
<p>no sanction from the authority of any name ; neither
</p>
<p>do I pretend to give them any weight by declaring
</p>
<p>them to be conscientiously my own ; but if you want
</p>
<p>authority to induce the conviction that the union
</p>
<p>had injustice for its principle, and a crime for its
</p>
<p>basis, I appeal to that of his Majesty's present At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, Mr. Saurin, who in his place in the
</p>
<p>Irish parliament pledged his character as a lawyer
</p>
<p>and a statesman, that the union must be a violation
</p>
<p>of every moral principle, and that it was a mere
</p>
<p>question of prudence whether it should not be re-
</p>
<p>sisted by force. I also appeal to the opinions of the
</p>
<p>late Lord Higli Chancellor of Ireland, Mr. George
</p>
<p>Ponsonby, of the present Solicitor-General, Mr.
</p>
<p>Bushe, and of that splendid lawyer, Mr. Plunket.
</p>
<p>The union was therefore a manifest injustice ; and
</p>
<p>it continues to be unjust at this day ; it was a crime,

</p>
<p>sympathy can we, in our sufferings, expect from
</p>
<p>those men? what solicitude for our interests ? what
</p>
<p>are they to Ireland, or Ireland to them ? No, Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheriff, we are not represented ; w-e have no effec-
</p>
<p>tual share in the legislation ; the thing is a mere
</p>
<p>mockery ; neither is the imperial parliament com-
</p>
<p>petent to legislate for us : it is too unwieldy a ma-
</p>
<p>chine to legislate with discernment for England
</p>
<p>alone ; hut with respect to Irelaml, it has all the addi-
</p>
<p>tional inconveniences that arise from want of interest
</p>
<p>and total ignorance. Sir, when I talk of the utter
</p>
<p>ignorance in Irish affairs of the members of the Irish
</p>
<p>parliament, I do not exaggerMte or niisstnte ; the
</p>
<p>ministers themselves are in absolute daikness with
</p>
<p>respect to this country. I undertake to demonstrate
</p>
<p>it. Sir, they have presumed to speak of the grow,
</p>
<p>ing prosperity of Ireland ; I know them to be vile
</p>
<p>and profligate ; I cannot be suspected of flattering
</p>
<p>them ; yet, vile as they are, I do not believe that they
</p>
<p>could have had the audacity to insert in the speech,
</p>
<p>supposed to be spoken by his Majesty, that expres-

<p>sion, had they known that, in fact, Ireland was in

<p>commerce extending, and our felicity consummate.
</p>
<p>When you detect the ministers themselves in such
</p>
<p>gross innorance as, upon such authority, to place an
</p>
<p>insulting falsehood as it were in the mouth of our
</p>
<p>revered sovereign, what think you can be the fitness
</p>
<p>of nine minor imps of legislation to make laws for
</p>
<p>Ireland ? Indeed, the recent plans of taxation suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently evince how incompetent the present scheme
</p>
<p>of parliament is to legislate for Ireland. Had we
</p>
<p>an Irish parliament, it is impossible to conceive that
</p>
<p>they would have adopted taxes at once oppressive
</p>
<p>and unproductive; ruinous to the country, and use-
</p>
<p>less to the crown. No, sir, an Irish parliament, ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the state of the country, and indivi-
</p>
<p>dually interested to tax proper objects, would have,
</p>
<p>even in this season of distress, no difficulty in rais-
</p>
<p>ing the necessary supplies. The loyalty and good
</p>
<p>sense of the Irish nation would aid them ; and we
</p>
<p>should not, as now, perceive taxation unproductive
</p>
<p>()t money, but abundantly fertile in discontent.
</p>
<p>There is another subject that peculiarly requires the
</p>
<p>attention of the legislature ; but it is one which can
</p>
<p>be managed only by a resident and domestic par-
</p>
<p>liament^t includes everything that relates to those
</p>
<p>strange and portentous disturbances which, from
</p>
<p>time to time, affright and desolate the ftiirest dis-
</p>
<p>tricts of the island. It is a delicate diflicult subject,
</p>
<p>and one that would require the most minute know-
</p>
<p>ledge of the causes that produce those disturbances,
</p>
<p>and vrould demand all the attention and care of men,
</p>
<p>whose individual safety was connected with the dis-
</p>
<p>covery of a proper remedy. I do not wish to calcu-
</p>
<p>late the extent of evil that may be dreaded from
</p>
<p>the outrages I allude to, if our country shall con-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>heard that speech read from beginning to end, be-
</p>
<p>cause that speech conveys the same sentiments, the
</p>
<p>same feeUngs, and inculcates the same great princi-
</p>
<p>ples, almost in the very same language, as we find
</p>
<p>employed by Mr. O'ConneU in 1843 and 1844. That
</p>
<p>long series of speeches and of writings produced by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'ConneU within the last nine months, are no
</p>
<p>more than an expansion of the speech of 1810. Was
</p>
<p>he a conspirator in 1810 ? If so, he was engaged in
</p>
<p>a conspiracy with Sir Robert Shaw, who took tlie
</p>
<p>chair when the high sheriff left it, and declared that
</p>
<p>it was the boast of his life that he had opposed the
</p>
<p>union, and that he persevered in the same senti-
</p>
<p>ments ; and vrill a man in 1844 be accounted guilty
</p>
<p>of a crime verging on treason, because he has re-
</p>
<p>peated the opinions whicii he entertained when the
</p>
<p>shade of an imputation did not rest upon him ?
</p>
<p>This is a consideration to which, I am sure, that you
</p>
<p>will think that too mucli importance cannot be at-
</p>
<p>tached. At that aggregate meeting, including so
</p>
<p>large a portion of the Protestant inhabitants of this
</p>
<p>town, with the high sheriff of the Dublin corpora-
</p>
<p>tion in the chair, a series of resolutions were passed
</p>
<p>against the union. It was determined that petitions
</p>
<p>should be presented to parliament, and that they
</p>
<p>should be entrusted to Sir Robert Shaw and to Mr.
</p>
<p>Grattan. Sir Robert Shaw, in his answer, stated
</p>
<p>that he had opposed the union in parUament, and
</p>
<p>that his opinions were unaltered. The following is
</p>
<p>the answer of Mr. Grattan, and that answer affords
</p>
<p>a proof of the falsehood of an allegation often made,
</p>
<p>that a great change of opinion had taken place in

<p>legislative union : 
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen  I have the honour to receive an ad-
</p>
<p>dress presented by your committee, and an expres-
</p>
<p>sion of their wishes that I should present certain
</p>
<p>petitions and support the repeal of an act entitled
</p>
<p>the Act of Union ; and your committee adds, that
</p>
<p>it speaks with the authority of my constituency,
</p>
<p>the freemen and freeholders of the city of Dubhn.
</p>
<p>I beg to assure your committee, and through them
</p>
<p>my much-beloved und much-respected constiuents,
</p>
<p>that 1 shall accede to their proposition. I shall pre-
</p>
<p>sent their petitions, and shall support the repeal of
</p>
<p>the act of union with thatdecidedattaclunent to our
</p>
<p>connection with Great Britain, and to that harmony
</p>
<p>between the two countries, without which the con-
</p>
<p>nection, cannot last. I do not impair either, as I
</p>
<p>apprehend, when I assure you I shall support the
</p>
<p>repeal of the act of union. You will please to ob-
</p>
<p>serve, that a proposition of that sort, in parliament,
</p>
<p>to be either prudent or possible, must wait till it is
</p>
<p>called for and backed by the nation. When pro-
</p>
<p>posed I shall then  as at all times I hope I shall 
</p>
<p>prove myself an Irishman, and that Wshman whose
</p>
<p>first and last passion was his native country.
</p>
<p>"Henry Grattan."
</p>
<p>"Backed by the nation." Mark that phrase. It
</p>
<p>occurs again and again in the speeches of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'ConneU. Mr. O'Counell again and again declares
</p>
<p>that unless backed by the nation nothing can be ac-
</p>
<p>complished by him. And if it be a crime to apply
</p>
<p>all the resources of his mtellect, with an indefatiga-
</p>
<p>ble energj', and an indomitable perseverance to the
</p>
<p>attainment of that object by the means described
</p>
<p>by Mr. Grattan in the phrase, " backed by the na-
</p>
<p>tion," then is the sou of Daniel O'ConneU guilty.

<p>more efleetual were ailopted, and a conviction was
</p>
<p>obtained.. Mr. Saurin did not deny that the Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics had been excluded. He was of opinion
</p>
<p>that Protestant ascendancy should everywhere pre-
</p>
<p>vail, and not least in those public tribunals wliich
</p>
<p>are armed with so much authority, and exercise so
</p>
<p>much influence over the fortunes of the state. I did
</p>
<p>not blame Mr. Saurin. He acted, in all likelihood,
</p>
<p>conscientiously, and whatever were Iiis faults, du-
</p>
<p>plicity was certainly not amongst the number. I
</p>
<p>saw him in the height of his power and in his fall ;
</p>
<p>he was meek in his prosperity, and in his adverse
</p>
<p>fortune he was serene. The lustre of adversity
</p>
<p>shone in his smile ; for his faults, such as they were,
</p>
<p>his name, in an almost inevitable inheritance of an-
</p>
<p>tipathy, furnislies an excuse. How much more
</p>
<p>commendable was his conduct and the conduct of
</p>
<p>the government of the day, than if they had been
</p>
<p>profuse of professions they never meant to realise,
</p>
<p>and had offered an insult to the understanding as
</p>
<p>well as a gross wrong to the rights of the Irish peo-
</p>
<p>ple ; and yet I shall not be surprised if, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing all that has happened, the same cant of im-
</p>
<p>partiality shall be persevered in, and that we shall
</p>
<p>hear the same protestations of solicitude to make no
</p>
<p>distinction between CathoUcs and Protestants in all
</p>
<p>departments, but more especially in the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of the law. The screen falls  " the little

<p>commons, the exclamation of Sir Peter Teazle,
</p>
<p>"Oh, damn your sentiment 1" will break in upon
</p>
<p>him on every side. The government, as I told you,
</p>
<p>in 1812, succeeded in their state prosecution. What
</p>
<p>good for the country was effected by it ? Was the
</p>
<p>Catholic question put down, or did a verdict facili-
</p>
<p>tate the government of Mr. Peel, who was soon after
</p>
<p>appointed secretary for Ireland ? He was an Irisli
</p>
<p>member. You are surprised at the intimation . He
</p>
<p>was returned for the borough of Cashel, where a very
</p>
<p>small, but a very discriminating constituency, were
</p>
<p>made sensible of his surpassing merits. It has been
</p>
<p>remarked that young statesmen who are destined to
</p>
<p>oper.ate upon England, are first sent to dissect in
</p>
<p>this country. Mr. Peel had a fine hand and admi-
</p>
<p>rable instruments, and he certainly gave proof that
</p>
<p>he would give the least possible pain in any ampu-
</p>
<p>tations which he might afterwards have to perform.
</p>
<p>He was decorous  he avoided the language of wan-
</p>
<p>ton insult  endeavoured to give us the advantages
</p>
<p>of a mild despotism, and " dwelt in decencies for
</p>
<p>ever." Yet, was his Irish government, and he must
</p>
<p>have felt it, an utter failure  he must have seen,
</p>
<p>even then, the irresistible arguments in favour of
</p>
<p>Catholic emancipation ; but he had not the moral
</p>
<p>intrepidity to break from his party, and to do at
</p>
<p>once what he was compelled to do afterwards. The
</p>
<p>insurrection act was renewed, the disturbances of
</p>
<p>the country were not diminished, and Ireland con-
</p>
<p>tinued to reap the bitter fruits of imperial legisla-
</p>
<p>tion. A new policy was tried after Mr. Peel had
</p>
<p>proceeded to England, and the notable expedient
</p>
<p>was adopted of counteracting the secretary with the
</p>
<p>lord lieutenant, and the lord lieutenant with the
</p>
<p>secretary. We had Grant against T.albot, and

<p>have been read to you. AVTiat would have been
</p>
<p>thought of an indictment for a conspiracy against
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell. against the Evening Post, the Free-
</p>
<p>man's Journal, the Morning Register, Dr. Doyle, and
</p>
<p>my friend, Tom Steele, who was at that time, as he
</p>
<p>is now, a knight-errant animated by a noble chi-
</p>
<p>valry against oppression in every form ? Would it
</p>
<p>not have been deemed a monstrous thing to have
</p>
<p>read a very exciting article in three Homan Catholic
</p>
<p>newspapers, against the men \>y whom perhaps they
</p>
<p>never had been perused ? Such a thing was never
</p>
<p>thought of. There were, indeed, prosecutions.
</p>
<p>The individual who now addresses you was prose-
</p>
<p>cuted for a speech on the expedition of Wolfe Tone.
</p>
<p>The bills were found ; but Mr. Canning declared in
</p>
<p>the cabinet that there was not a single line in the
</p>
<p>speech, which, if spoken in the house of commons,
</p>
<p>would have justified a call for order, and he de-
</p>
<p>nounced the prosecution as utterly unjust. The
</p>
<p>prosecution was accordingly abandoned. But, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, if I had been prosecuted for a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and held responsible, not for my own speeches, but
</p>
<p>for those of others, in how different and how help-
</p>
<p>less !i position should I have been placed ? Have a
</p>
<p>care how you make a precedent in favour of such
</p>
<p>an indictment. During the last nine months, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General had ample opportunities, if his
</p>
<p>own statement be well founded, of institutiug pro-
</p>
<p>secutions against individuals for what they them-
</p>
<p>selves had written or done. In this proceeding,
</p>
<p>whose tardiness indicates its intent, you will not, 1
</p>
<p>feel confident, become his auxiliaries. A coercion

<p>would be preferable, for it operates as a temporary
</p>
<p>suspension of liberty, but the effects of a verdict are
</p>
<p>permanently deleterious. The doctrine of conspi-

</p>
<p>no matter how diversified their objects, or how dif-
</p>
<p>ferent their constitution, is within its reach. The

<p>Catholic question having been considered, the To-

<p>ries were put out by a conspiracy formed amongst
</p>
<p>themselves. The Whigs come in and the reform bill

<p>connected with some of the propositions to which I
</p>
<p>refer ; but there is one which I consider to be as
</p>
<p>practicable as it is plain and just. It is recommended
</p>
<p>that the imperial parliament should sit at certain
</p>
<p>intervals in this great city. I cannot see any sound
</p>
<p>objection in the imperial parliament assembling in
</p>
<p>the month of October, for the discharge of Irish bu-
</p>
<p>siness alone, and that all imperial questions should
</p>
<p>be reserved until the London session commenced, as
</p>
<p>it now does, in the month of February. The public
</p>
<p>departments, it is true, are all located in London ;
</p>
<p>but during the Irish session a reference to those de-
</p>
<p>partments would not be required. Such a session
</p>
<p>might be inconvenient to English members ; but the
</p>
<p>repeal agitation and a state prosecution, like the

<p>present, are attended with inconveniences far greater
</p>
<p>than any which English members in crossing the
</p>
<p>Irish channel would encounter. The advantages
</p>
<p>which would accrue from tlie realisation of this pro-
</p>
<p>ject are of no ordinary kind. The intercourse of
</p>
<p>the two countries would be augmented to a great
</p>
<p>extent  their feelings would be identified  national

<p>prejudices would be reciprocally laid aside. An
</p>
<p>English domestication would take place. Instead ol

</p>
<p>would buy lands in Ireland, and live upon them.
</p>
<p>The absentee drain would be diminished. The value
</p>
<p>of i)roperty would be very nearly doubled. Great
</p>
<p>public works would be undertaken, and the great
</p>
<p>natural endowments of the country would be turned
</p>
<p>to account. This city would appear in renovated
</p>
<p>splendour. Your streets would be shaken by the
</p>
<p>roll of the gorgeous equipages in which the first no-
</p>
<p>bles of the country would be borne to the senate

<p>house, from which the money changers should be
</p>
<p>driven. The mansions of the aristocracy would blaze
</p>
<p>with that useful luxury which ministers to the gra-
</p>
<p>tification of the affluent, and lo the employment and
</p>
<p>the comforts of the poor. The sovereign herselt
</p>
<p>would not deem the seat of her parliament unworthy
</p>
<p>of her residence. The frippery of the viceregal
</p>
<p>court would be swept away. We should look upon
</p>
<p>royalty itself, and not upon the tinsel image; we

<p>should behold the Queen of England, of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>of Scotland in all the pomp of her imperial regality,
</p>
<p>with a diadem  the finest diadem in the world-
</p>
<p>glittering upon ler brow, while her countenance

<p>beamed with the expression of that sentiment which

<p>becomes the throned monarch better than the crown.

</p>
<p>of Sir Robert Peel. I will not, gentlemen, disgust
</p>
<p>you by a more distinct reference to those traitorous
</p>
<p>diatribes, in which even clergymen took part. It
</p>
<p>is better we should inquire how it is that gentlemen
</p>
<p>connected witli these very prosecutions have thought
</p>
<p>it decorous to comport themselves when their own
</p>
<p>passions were excited. The name of the Right Hon.
</p>
<p>Frederick Shaw is attached to the proclamation. I
</p>
<p>hold in my hand the peroration of a speech delivered
</p>
<p>by that gentleman, and reported in the Evening
</p>
<p>Mail ; " Tlie government might make what regula-
</p>
<p>tion it pleased ; but he trusted the people knew their
</p>
<p>duty too well to submit to its enactments. AVe

</p>
<p>our properties ; but if the government dared to lay
</p>
<p>its haUd on the Bible, tlien we must come to an
</p>
<p>issue. We will cover it with our bodies. My
</p>
<p>friends, will you permit your brethren to call out to
</p>
<p>you in vain ? In the name of ray country and my
</p>
<p>country's God, I will appeal from a British house of
</p>
<p>commons to a British people. My countrymen
</p>
<p>would obey the laws so long as they were properly
</p>
<p>administered ; but if it were sought to lay sacrilegi-
</p>
<p>ous hands on the Bible, to tear the standard of the
</p>
<p>living God, and to raise a mutilated one in its stead,
</p>
<p>then it would be no time to halt between two opi-
</p>
<p>nions  then, in every hill and every valley would

<p>resound the rallying cry of 'To your tents, O

<p>Board, it is not very easy to conjecture ; but I may
</p>
<p>venture to ask the Solicitor-General, who is himself
</p>
<p>a commissioner of the Education Board, whether
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell, in his whole course of agitation,
</p>
<p>ever uttered a speech half so inflammatory as this ?
</p>
<p>With respect to Mr. Sergeant Warren, he, I sup-
</p>
<p>pose, agrees in every word of it, and only laments
</p>
<p>that after so much sound and fury the Recorder of
</p>
<p>l)ublin is the steadfast supporter of the government,
</p>
<p>by whom all the misdeeds thus eloquently denounced
</p>
<p>have been subsequently committed. Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>find in the Evening Packet of the 24th of January,
</p>
<p>1837, an account of a great Protestant meeting wliich
</p>
<p>took place at the Miinsion House, where all the grc-it
</p>
<p>representatives of the Conservative interest in this
</p>
<p>country were assembled . Some very strong speeches,
</p>
<p>indeed, were made at that meeting. The Earl of Cliar-
</p>
<p>leville said, " Well, gentlemen, you have a rebellious
</p>
<p>parliament ; you have a Lord Lieutenant, the slave
</p>
<p>and minion of a rebellious parliament." That
</p>
<p>speech was heard by the Bight Hon. Thomas Berry
</p>
<p>Cusack Smith. Did he remonstrate against the use
</p>
<p>of language so unqualified ? Not at all. He got up
</p>
<p>and made a speech, in Avhich he stated that "he was
</p>
<p>sorry to find that Roman Catholic members of par-
</p>
<p>liament paid so little regard to their oaths." When
</p>
<p>the right honourable gentleman had such impres-
</p>
<p>sions, I cannot feel sui-prised that care should have
</p>
<p>been taken to exclude every Roman Cathohc from
</p>
<p>the jury-box. Let him not misapprehend me. I do
</p>
<p>not refer to his language in the spirit of resentment.
</p>
<p>Resentment is not the feeling which the conduct of
</p>
<p>the right honourable gentleman is calculated to pro-
</p>
<p>duce. The right honourable gentleman has ex-
</p>
<p>pressed great indignation at the references made at
</p>

</p>
<p>expressed in warm and energetic language, and
</p>
<p>having given three cheers, deployed round and took
</p>
<p>the position assigned them. . . . Amongst those
</p>
<p>who marched at the' head of the largest battalion, if
</p>
<p>we may use the expression, were the Marquisses of
</p>
<p>Londonderry and Downshire ; Lord ClanwiUiam, Sir
</p>
<p>Eobert Sateson, Colonel Forde, Colonel Blacker,
</p>
<p>Lord Castlereagh, and Lord Roden. The latter had
</p>
<p>fifteen thousand men in his followers. They marched
</p>
<p>froni Dromore. At twelve o'clock the scene was the
</p>
<p>most imposing that fancy could conceive, or that
</p>
<p>language 'possesses the power of depicting. The
</p>
<p>spectacle was grand, unique, sublime. There cer-
</p>
<p>tainly could not have been, upon the most moderate
</p>
<p>computation, less than seventy-five thousand persons
</p>
<p>present, eSclusive of the thousands who filled the
</p>
<p>town, or thronged to!absolute impediment all the
</p>
<p>adjacent roads and avenues." From that description,
</p>
<p>geptlemen, I turn to a resolution passed by the Irish
</p>
<p>Orangemen on the 12th November, 1834, and which
</p>
<p>I find in the appendix to the report from the select
</p>
<p>committee on Orange lodges :  " And, lastly, we
</p>
<p>would beg to call the attention of the grand lodge,

<p>and through them return our lieartfelt thanks and

</p>
<p>faction.' " That phrase, gentlemen, is one which
</p>
<p>Lord Stanley, in one of his wayward moods, was
</p>
<p>pleased to apply to the Orangemen of Ireland. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, in the part of the report, which I have read
</p>
<p>to' you, there are some remarkable entries relating
</p>
<p>to a subject of which you have heard a good deal
</p>
<p>from the Attorney-General ; and although I deviate,
</p>
<p>I am aware, from the order of topics, which I had
</p>
<p>prescribed to myself, yet, finding in the book before
</p>
<p>me matter which seems to me to be exceedingly per-
</p>
<p>tinent to tliat topic, I shall now advert to it. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the entries to which I am alluding are these :

<p>the printed documents should be forwarded direct

<p>to our military brethren." " 1st January, 1834

<p>to seduce the army from their allegiance, would

<p>kept with the malevolent intention of enabling the
</p>
<p>whole population to rise at a given time, and esta-
</p>
<p>blish a republic, of wliich Mr. O'Connell was to be
</p>
<p>> the head. ]'"orly-one of these meetings were held
</p>
<p>all of the same oharacter and at length a proclama-
</p>
<p>tion was determined on and issued for the purpose
</p>
<p>of putting a stop to the Clontarf meeting. You
</p>
<p>have heard the remarks of Mr. O'Connell, in refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the course adopted towards that meeting,
</p>
<p>and to me they appear extremely reasonable. Notice
</p>
<p>of that meeting had been giyen for three weeks, yet
</p>
<p>the proclamation was not published until the day
</p>
<p>before that on which it was to have taken place.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell did not charge the government, when
</p>
<p>acting in tliis way, and delaying its measures till the
</p>
<p>last moment, with being capable of such an atro-
</p>
<p>cious and destructive attempt on the lives of the
</p>
<p>people, as might have been perpetrated by sending
</p>
<p>the army amongst an unarmed populace, if the
</p>

</p>
<p>have taken place ; and it is to be regretted that a
</p>
<p>IBore timely warning, one that would have removed
</p>
<p>all doubt and uncertainty, was not given. I pass
</p>
<p>this consideration by, and come to another point.
</p>
<p>It is a usual practice a rule, in fact  that when a
</p>
<p>privy counsel is to assemble, summonses are directed
</p>
<p>to be issued to all privy councillors beingwithin the
</p>
<p>' vicinity of the city of Dublin. On this occasion such
</p>
<p>summonses were not issued. I am given to under-

<p>stand that Chief Baron Brady, who is in the habit
</p>
<p>of attending at councils, was not summoned. The

</p>

</p>
<p> a man who had never appeared in public assem-
</p>

</p>
<p>meetings  a man who had never uttered an inflam-
</p>
<p>matory harangue in his life  that gentleman did not
</p>
<p>receive a summons. I will make no comment on
</p>
<p>this omission of the government on this occasion,
</p>
<p>but such undoubtedly is the fact. I have told you
</p>
<p>vrho did not receive summonses, and I shall proceed
</p>
<p>to state who did receive them. The Recorder of the
</p>
<p>city of Dublin  by whom the jury list was to be re-
</p>
<p>visedhe received a summons. In his department
</p>
<p>it was that an event most untoward, as respects the
</p>
<p>traversers, befel. It was suggested in this court that
</p>
<p>the jury list possibly might have been mutilated or
</p>
<p>decimated  for decimation it was  by an accident
</p>
<p>perhaps by a rat, as was sugguested by one of the
</p>
<p>. court. I am far from suggesting that there was any
</p>
<p>intentional foul play in this decimation, but that a
</p>
<p>large portion of the list was omitted is beyond a
</p>
<p>doubt. I state the fact and make no comment on
</p>
<p>jt. Well, an application was made for the names
</p>
<p>of the witnesses on the back of the document, on
</p>
<p>behalf of the traversers. One of the judges declared
</p>
<p>he thought it matter of right ; another of the judges
</p>
<p>intimated his opinion that it would be advisable for
</p>
<p>the crown to furnish the list within a reasonable
</p>
<p>time. From that day to this the list has never been
</p>
<p>given. The list of jurors is drawn by ballot : there
</p>
<p>are eleven Catholics upon it. They are struck off.
</p>
<p>The trial comes on. A challenge is put in to the
</p>
<p>array, upon the ground that one-tenth, or very
</p>
<p>nearly one-tenth, of the jury list was suppressed.

</p>
<p>How have the repeal conspirators proceeded? Every
</p>
<p>one of their assemblages liave been open to the
</p>
<p>public. For a shilling, all they said, or did, or
</p>
<p>thought, were known to the government. Every-
</p>
<p>thing was laid bare and naked to the public eye ;
</p>
<p>they stripped their minds in the public gaze. No
</p>
<p>oaths, no declaration, no initiation, no form of any
</p>
<p>kind was resorted to. They did not even act to-
</p>
<p>gether. Mr. Jluffy, proprietor of the Nation, did
</p>
<p>not attend a single meeting in the country. My
</p>
<p>client attended only three ; Mr. Tierney, the priest,
</p>
<p>attended no more than one. It would have been
</p>
<p>more manly on the p.irt of the Attorney-General to
</p>
<p>have indicted Dr. Higgins or Dr. C.-intH-ell, or, as
</p>
<p>he was pleased to designate them, Bishop Higgins
</p>
<p>and Bishop Cantwell. Well, why did he not catch
</p>
<p>a bishop  if not Cantwell, at all events Higgins?
</p>
<p>For three months we heard nothing but "Higgins,
</p>
<p>Higgins, Higgins." The Times was redolent of
</p>
<p>Higgins ; sornetimes he was Lord Higgins, then he
</p>
<p>was l*riest Higgins, afterwards Mr. Higgins. But
</p>
<p>wherefore is not this redoubted Higgins indicted, or
</p>
<p>why did you not assail the great John of Tuam him-
</p>
<p>self? He would not have shrunk from your perse-
</p>
<p>cution, but, with his mitre on his head and his
</p>
<p>crozier in his hand, he would have walked in his
</p>
<p>pontifical vestments into gaol, and smiled disdain-
</p>
<p>fully upon you. But you did not dare to attack
</p>
<p>him, but fell on a poor Monaghan priest, who only
</p>
<p>attended one meeting, and only made one speech
</p>
<p>about the" Yellow Ford," for which you should not

<p>(enormous mass of speeches delivered by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell within the last nine months has been laid be-
</p>
<p>fore you. I think, however, you will come to the
</p>
<p>conclusion that they are nothing more than a repe-
</p>
<p>tition of the opinions which he expressed in 1810 ;
</p>
<p>and when you come to consider them in detail, you
</p>
<p>will, I am sure, be convinced that these speeches
</p>
<p>were not merely interspersed with references to
</p>
<p>peace and order, with a view to escape from the
</p>
<p>law, but that there runs, through the entire mass of
</p>
<p>thought that came from the mind of Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>a pervading love of order, and an unaffected senti-
</p>
<p>ment of abhorrence for the employment of any
</p>
<p>other than loyal, constitutional, and pacific means
</p>
<p>for the attainment of his object. He attaches fully
</p>
<p>as much importance to the means as to the end. He
</p>
<p>declares that he would not purchase the repeal of
</p>
<p>the union at the cost of one drop of blood. He an-
</p>
<p>nounces that the moment the government calls upon
</p>
<p>him to disperse his meetings, these meetings shall
</p>
<p>be dispersed. He does but ask ' ' the Irish nation to
</p>
<p>back him ;" for from that backing he anticipates the
</p>
<p>only success to which, as a good subject, as a good
</p>
<p>citizen, and as a good Christian, he could aspire.
</p>
<p>But if, gentlemen, it be suggested that in popular
</p>
<p>harangues obedience to the laws and submission to
</p>
<p>authority are easily simulated, I think I may fear-
</p>
<p>lessly assert that of the charges preferred against
</p>
<p>him his life alFords the refutation. A man cannot
</p>
<p>wear the mask of loyalty for forty-four years ; how-
</p>
<p>ever skilfully constructed, the vizor will sometimes
</p>
<p>drop off, and the natural truculence of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rator must be disclosed. You may have heard many

</p>
<p>You recollect (it is from such incidents that we are
</p>
<p>enabled to judge of the cliaracters and feelings of
</p>
<p>men) you remember to have heard in the course of
</p>
<p>the evidence frequent reference made to poor old
</p>
<p>Sir Bradley King. The unfortunate man had been
</p>
<p>deprived of his office, and all compensation was de-
</p>
<p>nied him. He used to stand in the lobby of the
</p>
<p>House of Commons, the most desolate and hopeless
</p>
<p>looking man I ever saw. The only one of his old
</p>
<p>friends that stuck to him almost was Baron Lefroy.
</p>
<p>But Baron Lefroy had no interest with the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. Mr. O'ConnellsawBradleyKing, and took pity
</p>
<p>on him. Bradley King had been his fierce political,
</p>
<p>almost his personal antagonist. Mr. O'Connell went
</p>
<p>to Lord Althorpe, and obtained for Bradley King the
</p>
<p>cornpensation which had been refused him. I re-
</p>
<p>member having read a most strilcing letter addressed
</p>
<p>by Sir Abraham Bradley King to Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>and asked him for it. He could not at first put his
</p>
<p>hand upon it ; but, while looking for it, he told me
</p>
<p>that soon after the death of the old Dublin alderman
</p>
<p>an officer entered his study, and told him that he
</p>
<p>was the son-in-law of Sir Abraham, who had, a
</p>
<p>short time before his death, called him to his bedside
</p>
<p>and said  " When I shall have been buried, go to
</p>
<p>Daniel O'Connell, and tell him that the last prayer

<p>order of the traverser's counsel, said he felt very
</p>
<p>grateful for the kindness thus accorded him by the
</p>
<p>court; if it was not trespassing too much on the
</p>
<p>public time and that of the court, he would feel it a
</p>
<p>respite not to be called on till Monday. K his lord-
</p>
<p>ship had not thrown out the suggestion he had been
</p>
<p>kind enough to make, he should hare thought him-
</p>
<p>self justified in asking such a favour. If their
</p>
<p>lordships thought they could consistently, with the
</p>
<p>discharge of their public duty, postpone the further
</p>
<p>hearing of the case till Monday, he should be most
</p>
<p>happy to avail himself of the indulgence.
</p>
<p>The Lord Cliief Justice said it was now three
</p>
<p>o'clock, and, without infringing unnecessarily on
</p>
<p>the public time, it would be the desire of the court
</p>
<p>to give Mr. Moore every indulgence in their power ;
</p>
<p>and as he (Mr. Moore) felt he would rather not go
</p>
<p>on at present, but prefer waiting till Monday, as liis
</p>
<p>speech, his lordship presumed, would not be finished
</p>
<p>that evening, the court, if the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>had no objection, would let the case be postponed
</p>
<p>till Monday at ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>The Attorney- General having intimated his
</p>
<p>acquiescence in the course thus suggested, the
</p>
<p>court rose at a iew minutes after three o'clock, hav-

<p>and gentlemen of the jury, in this case lam counsel
</p>
<p>on behalf of one of the traversers, the Eev. Thomas

</p>
<p>counsel in seniority to my friend Mr. Shell, and in
</p>
<p>that right, and in that character alone, to lay before
</p>
<p>ypu the facts and circumstances of my client's case ;
</p>
<p>and I do, with very respectful confidence, anticipate
</p>
<p>your verdict of acquittal in his favour. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I very unfeignedly feel tlie great disadvantage I
</p>
<p>labour under in having to address you after the
</p>
<p>able, brilliant, and eloquent display of my friend
</p>
<p>Mr. SheU. If that disadvantage was to be merely
</p>
<p>personal, if it could not in the slightest degree affect
</p>
<p>my client, it would not be worthy of one moment's
</p>
<p>consideration ; and although I acknowledge my
</p>
<p>perfect inability either to amuse you by wit, or
</p>
<p>delight you by eloquence  and although I profess
</p>
<p>not the power of addressing to you any of tiiose

<p>hope that you will extend to me, while I am laying
</p>
<p>my client's case before you, the same patience and
</p>
<p>the same attention wliich I have observed you in-
</p>
<p>variably to bestow upon every branch and every
</p>
<p>feature of this important case. Gentlemen, there is
</p>
<p>one observation which was made by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General in his opening statement, in which I fully
</p>
<p>concur, and from wliich no man can dissent. He
</p>
<p>told you that this was a momentous case, and he
</p>
<p>might have added, that it comes before you under
</p>
<p>momentous circumstances and in momentous times.
</p>
<p>When we consider the great and important ques-
</p>
<p>tion  I mean the repeal of the union  out of which
</p>
<p>this prosecution has undeniably arisen ; when we

<p>consider the deep and all-pervading interest which

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>for hftvingf Sent forward to the world a seditious
</p>
<p>publication ; but the single charge preferred against
</p>
<p>the traversers at the bar is. that they are guilty of
</p>
<p>conspiracy. How is that charge sought to be made
</p>
<p>Out ? By the allegation that there were meetings
</p>
<p>that were unlawful, and that those meetings were
</p>
<p>attended by some of the traversers  by the allega-
</p>
<p>tion that seditious speeches were spoken at tliose
</p>
<p>meetings by some of the traversers. But does it not
</p>
<p>occur to you, that if the object of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General was to bring to justice those who, in his
</p>
<p>opinion, had violated the law, that there was the
</p>
<p>most easy, simple, and obvious course for him to
</p>
<p>take? If the meetings, of which you have heard so
</p>
<p>much in detail, were unlawful  if they are unlawful
</p>
<p>now they must have been unlawful at the time ihey
</p>
<p>were held if those speeches are seditious now they
</p>
<p>must have been seditious at the time they were
</p>
<p>uttered  and yet how does it happen that although
</p>
<p>those meetings have been held almost weekly for a
</p>
<p>period of nine months  although the speeches now
</p>
<p>complained of have been made almost from day to
</p>
<p>day during that period  how does it happen that
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General never yet ventured to prefer
</p>
<p>an indictment against any one of the individuals
</p>
<p>that attended those assemblies, that he seeks now to
</p>
<p>designate as unlawful ? or to institute a prosecution
</p>
<p>against any one of those individuals that uttered
</p>
<p>those speeches, that he now tells you are seditious ?
</p>
<p>If those meetings were illegal, or the speeches se-
</p>
<p>ditious, what was more easy for him than to indict
</p>
<p>any one that attended those meetings, or uttered
</p>
<p>those speeches ? Let me take, for instance, Mr.

<p>O'Connell, who attended at almost all the meetings.
</p>
<p>Suppose he was indicted for having attended an il-
</p>
<p>legal meeting, could anything be more simple than
</p>
<p>the proceeding on the part of the Attorney- General ?
</p>
<p>That the meetings took place, and that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell attended them, is undeniable. The material
</p>
<p>facts of the case were established to the hand of the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General ; and if the meetings were un-
</p>
<p>lawful he had nothing to do but satisfy the court
</p>
<p>and jury that they were so, and then bring the mat-
</p>
<p>ter to issue at a single point. But have 1 not reason
</p>
<p>to complain, on the part of my client, of the course
</p>
<p>which has been adopted. K my client has attended
</p>
<p>an illegal meeting, or uttered a seditious speech,
</p>
<p>why not indict him for it? the charge against him
</p>
<p>would be simple, and his defence, if he had any,
</p>
<p>would be easy. The Attorney-General has aban-
</p>
<p>doned the easy, unembarassed course which it was
</p>
<p>open to him to take, and he adopts a course which
</p>
<p>appears to me to be in violation of every principle
</p>
<p>bf justice. He seeks to make one man responsible
</p>
<p>for the acts and language of others. He flings all
</p>
<p>the traversers into one indictment^he entangles
</p>
<p>therri, one and all, within the meshes of a prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion for conspiracy. And although it is not even
</p>
<p>alleged that my client ever was in connection with
</p>
<p>any of the traversers until the "d of October, after
</p>
<p>all the monster meetings had ceased, he endeavours,
</p>
<p>liotwithstanding, to make him responsible for all the
</p>
<p>antecedent acts of others, and he is thus sought to
</p>
<p>be vijited with the consequences of speeches he
</p>
<p>never heard meetings he never attended  and pub-
</p>
<p>lications which he never read. Is this fair? Is
</p>
<p>thiscariilid ? Is this ingenuous? The principles of

<p>justice declare that each man is only to be made

</p>
<p>ewn with negligence. I attribute their conduct
</p>
<p>to another source. It strikes me as a fair prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of charity, that wliere you can find a good
</p>
<p>and proper motive to refer the conduct of another
</p>
<p>to, it is to that pure motive, not to any sinister de-
</p>
<p>signs, his actions ought to be attributed. I willingly
</p>
<p>grant the benefit of this maxim to the government,
</p>
<p>and I shall hereafter respectfuUj' ask for the applica-
</p>
<p>tion of the same principle to the case of my client.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the conviction in my mind is this, that
</p>
<p>though the Attorney-General has screwed his cou-
</p>
<p>rage to the sticking place, and though he is now
</p>
<p>prepared to come into court and brand all those
</p>
<p>meetings with a charge of illegality, yet he never
</p>
<p>felt himself so strong in that position, as to venture
</p>
<p>to bring any single case under the consideration of a
</p>
<p>courtorjury. Let the result of the present prosecu-
</p>
<p>tions be what it may, it is still open to him to adopt
</p>
<p>that course  let him select all or any of the meetings
</p>
<p>he pleases  let him bring into this court any or all
</p>
<p>of the persons who attended those meetings  and
</p>
<p>let him try the question fairly. But that has not been
</p>
<p>done. The cause was obvious. The Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral is an able lawyer, and if he could have told the
</p>
<p>government that those meetings were illegal, if his
</p>
<p>mind were made up on tliat point, I have no doubt
</p>
<p>he would at once have said to the government, that
</p>
<p>he could not look on and see the law violated, and
</p>
<p>would have told them that he felt it his duty to
</p>
<p>institute the necessary prosecutions against the per-
</p>
<p>sons who had done those criminal acts. But it is
</p>
<p>my firm conviction, that the Attorney-General was

</p>
<p>not prepared to go such lengths as to sanction any
</p>
<p>prosecution by his authority, and the meetings
</p>
<p>were, therefore, allowed to go on for a period of nine
</p>
<p>months, because no lawyer was bold enough to say
</p>
<p>they ought to be put down by a prosecution. What
</p>
<p>is the use I make of this ? If the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>was doubtful in his own mind that any breach of
</p>
<p>the law had been committed  if he could not during
</p>
<p>niiie months be able to bring himself to the conclu-
</p>
<p>sion that the meetings were illegal, is he now to be
</p>
<p>allowed, when thousands have attended those meet-
</p>
<p>ings with a full conviction on their minds that they
</p>
<p>were not violating the law, to brand them with ille-
</p>
<p>gality and sedition ? Whenever you find an attor-
</p>
<p>ney-general abandoning the direct and obvious
</p>
<p>course which was before him and adopting a tortuous
</p>
<p>and complicated one, tacitly permitting the assem-
</p>
<p>blages of the people, no jury should aid or assist him
</p>
<p>in a proceeding to bring to punishment those who
</p>
<p>so attended, and I take the liberty of saying, that
</p>
<p>if the Attorney-General be right in his law, thou-
</p>
<p>sands upon thousands have been lured into the com-
</p>
<p>mission of crime. The Attorney-General having gone
</p>
<p>seriatim through all those meetinirs, he came to a
</p>
<p>meeting which Was to have been held at Clontarf on
</p>
<p>the 8th of October, and I must confess, I never ex-
</p>
<p>perienced a greater degree of surprise and astonish-
</p>
<p>ment, than when I heard him tell you that that
</p>
<p>meeting was abandoned from a conviction of its ille-
</p>
<p>gality. 1 am Sure the Attorney-General entertained
</p>
<p>that opinion or he would not have expressed it ;
</p>
<p>but I am sure there is no other individu.al in the
</p>
<p>cbromunSty who would for a moment think that the
</p>
<p>cftuSe of its abandonment was a conviction of its
</p>
<p>illegality. Does the Attorney-General forget, or

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, let me ask you this plain and simple
</p>
<p>question  have you a shadow of evidence of the
</p>
<p>existence of such an agreement by the traversers in
</p>
<p>general, or by Mr. Tierney in particular ? Have
</p>
<p>you had any person produced to you who ever saw
</p>
<p>them together, arranging such an agreement  or
</p>
<p>who ever said he knew that such an agreement liad
</p>
<p>been entered into. I do not mean to say that you
</p>
<p>should liave direct evidence of the fact. I acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge it might be made without direct positive testi-
</p>
<p>mony ; but what testimony of any kind have you
</p>
<p>to enable you to say that this agreement ever did
</p>
<p>take place? where could you say it took place?
</p>
<p>Has the Attornej'-General shown you when it did
</p>
<p>take place ?.He has gone over a period of nine months,
</p>
<p>and he has then left it to you to pick out the date
</p>
<p>of the existence of this alleged agreement  he has
</p>
<p>not told you where the agreement took place. Tlie
</p>
<p>meetings have been lield in every part of Ireland 
</p>
<p>did it take place in the north, or the south, in the
</p>
<p>east, or in the west ? Was it before the first meet-
</p>
<p>ing, or before the second, or the third? He has of-
</p>
<p>fered no evidence to show at what time or place
</p>
<p>such an agreement was entered into. He has read
</p>
<p>for you innumerable speeches and publications  he
</p>
<p>has read extracts from the newspapers  he has given
</p>
<p>you a line of prose here, and a line of verse there 
</p>
<p>and he flings them into your jury-box, and calls
</p>
<p>upon you to spell and construct a conspiracy out of
</p>
<p>them. I trustyou will never doit, when yourecoUect
</p>
<p>that the Attorney-General liad a plain course before
</p>
<p>liim to vindicate the law, which, if he had adopted, he
</p>
<p>might have tried every one of the traversers in less

<p>time than it took him to address you in this case ; and
</p>
<p>therefore I am sure j'ou will not aid him, you itill
</p>
<p>not infer for him the existence of a conspiracy ; for,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, it is the principle of all criminal law,
</p>
<p>that the charge should be made out by proof, it is
</p>
<p>not to be left to a jury to conjecture criminalitj'.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, my friend, Mr. Shell, called your atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the indictment in this case, and he described
</p>
<p>it, as he well might have done, a " monster indict-
</p>
<p>ment," words which are particularly appropriate ;
</p>
<p>for it is in accordance with tlie oft-repeated expres-
</p>
<p>sions of the Attorney-General himself in the course
</p>
<p>of the present prosecution. Gentlemen, it well de-
</p>
<p>serves to be called a " monster indictment;" I do
</p>
<p>not believe a precedent for it is to be found in the
</p>
<p>records of our criminal courts. It is truly a
</p>
<p>"monster," and it well deserves to be handed down
</p>
<p>to posterity as the " Frankinstein" of the imagina-
</p>
<p>tion of her Majesty's Attorney-General for Ireland.
</p>
<p>Is it not a monstrous indictment ? , You have in it
</p>
<p>an accumulation of meetings, of speeches, of publi-
</p>
<p>cations, and from them all the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>asks you to extract the materials which would sub-
</p>
<p>stantiate a charge of conspiracy. You have not
</p>
<p>heard it read, and I will not say it would afford you
</p>
<p>much pleasure to hear it read, but you may think
</p>
<p>it necessary in the discharge of your duty to read
</p>
<p>it, and if you read it twenty times over I doubt
</p>
<p>whether you could recollect half of the multitude
</p>
<p>of statements which are contained in it. Every
</p>
<p>person knows that the grand jury were occupied se-
</p>
<p>veral days in the discussion of it. To be sure, they
</p>
<p>ultimately found the bill ; but it is notorious, as one
</p>
<p>of them stated in the open court, that they were
</p>
<p>not unanimous in the finding of that bill. The duty

<p>himself against sncli a cliarge ? Is he to travel over
</p>
<p>Ireland to visit the place of every meeting  to
</p>
<p>acquaint himself and to instruct his counsel as to
</p>
<p>every occurrence that toolc place there ? is he to read
</p>
<p>every.speech that was made  to study every news-
</p>
<p>paper that is stated in the indictment, and he pre-
</p>
<p>pared to show that every meeting, every speech,
</p>
<p>and every puhlication was innocent ?  To require
</p>
<p>from my client that he should do so, is to ask him
</p>
<p>to effect .an impossibility. It is fair that every man
</p>
<p>should be prepared to justify what he himself has
</p>
<p>done orsaid, or what has been done or said by others,
</p>
<p>when sanctioned by his presence. But is it fair to
</p>
<p>ask Mr.' Tierney to justify the acts and language of
</p>
<p>others, during a period of nine months, of which he
</p>
<p>was totally ignorant, and to tell him tliat if he does
</p>
<p>not do so, he is to be convicted as a conspirator ?
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, let me ask you on general grounds
</p>
<p> is not the charge of conspiracy most improbable ?
</p>
<p>When any man is accused of a crime, the first and
</p>
<p>natural suggestion is to inquire into his character,
</p>
<p>his raiik and situation of life, his powers of judging,
</p>
<p>and how far it was likely he would be guilty of the
</p>
<p>offenee charged against him. Make those inquiries
</p>
<p>liere  ^who are the traversers ? they are all men of
</p>
<p>talents and education. Allow me to mention one 
</p>
<p>.Mr. O'Connell : he is known to be a gentleman of first
</p>
<p>r^te talent  a most able lawyer, peculiarly versed in
</p>
<p>criminal law, perfectly aware of the nature -of the
</p>
<p>crime of conspiracy, and yet you are asked to believe
</p>
<p>that he rushed with his eyes open into the commis-
</p>
<p>sion of.that ofience. Any man may inadvertently
</p>
<p>he present at an unlavrful meeting, and liave to

</p>
<p>answer for the consequences any man may, in the
</p>
<p>heat and ardour of speaking, utter language which
</p>
<p>he may not he able to justify, but no man can inad-
</p>
<p>vertently be a conspirator. It is a crime of delibe-
</p>
<p>ration, and you are asked to believe that one of the
</p>
<p>ablest and most experienced lawyers of his time has
</p>
<p>deliberately become a conspirator. But again, it is
</p>
<p>almost of the essence of conspiracy to be secret.
</p>
<p>The conspirator usually moves in darkness. Is that
</p>
<p>the case here  has there been any secrecy or con-
</p>
<p>cealment on the part of Mr. O'Connell, or any of the
</p>
<p>traversers? has not every part of their conduct been
</p>
<p>ae open as day ? The proofs of conspiracy are meet-
</p>
<p>ings, speeches, .and publications. The meetings
</p>
<p>are openly and publicly announced  the time and
</p>
<p>'place fixed  the speeches are uttered in the presence
</p>
<p>and hearing of thousands  the publications are to
</p>
<p>be found in the newspapers of the day. I ask again,
</p>
<p>is this the conduct of conspirators ? The meetings
</p>
<p>may have been illegal, the speeches seditious, the
</p>
<p>pubUcations libellous, and if that be so let each man
</p>
<p>be indicted for what he has done, said, or published,
</p>
<p>and let him undergo the consequences, but do not
</p>
<p>imphcate my client with acts and language jn which
</p>
<p>he never participated, or find him guilty for the
</p>
<p>conduct of others over whom he had no control.
</p>
<p>Therefore, gentlemen, upon this part of the case I
</p>
<p>confidently submit that you are not warranted in
</p>
<p>finding that a conspiracy or agreement ever existed
</p>
<p>between the traversers. If you adopt that view
</p>
<p>there is an end to the case, and you are bound to
</p>
<p>acquit all the traversers ; if you cannot adopt that
</p>
<p>view, I then come to the second branch of the case,
</p>
<p>and I do unhesitatingly assert that there is not the
</p>
<p>sUghtest.ground contained in the evidence that my

<p>obligatory upon conscience. It will be obeyed as
</p>
<p>long as England is strong ; but resistance to it will
</p>
<p>be in the abstract a duty, and the cxhihition of that
</p>
<p>resistance will be a mere question of prudence."
</p>
<p>Take any of the numerous speeches laid before you
</p>
<p>in evidence, and any one of the many publications
</p>
<p>read, and you will not find a proposition so strong
</p>
<p>in thonght or language as that wliich I have quoted
</p>
<p>for yon. I ask you, gentlemen, do you doubt the
</p>
<p>sincerity of those eminent men ? Do you doubt the
</p>
<p>sincerity of Charles Kendal Bushe, who, I regret to
</p>
<p>say, is no longer amongst us, but whose memory
</p>
<p>will ever remain enshrined in the hearts of his coun-
</p>
<p>trymen? Don you doubt the sincerity of Lord
</p>
<p>Plunket? Who ever doubted it? I rejoice to say
</p>
<p>he is still amongst us, commanding and possessing
</p>
<p>as he ever did, the love, the respect, the reverence,
</p>
<p>the admiration of all those who have had the honour
</p>
<p>and the happiness to know him. Do you doubt the
</p>
<p>sincerity of Mr. Saurin ? You have heard the pa-
</p>
<p>negyric which Mr. Shell, his political opponent,
</p>
<p>pronounced upon him  " He' may have had his
</p>
<p>faults." said he, " but hypocrisy was not among
</p>
<p>them." When you find these eminent men  not en-
</p>
<p>thusiastic boys, but men in the full maturity of their
</p>
<p>intellect, placed at the top of their profession, hold-
</p>
<p>ing seats in the legislature, and possessing a deep
</p>
<p>stake in the country  when you find these eminent
</p>
<p>men expressing such decided opinions with regard
</p>
<p>to the union, I ask you, do you doubt their since-
</p>
<p>rity ? If they had strong reasons for the opinions
</p>
<p>which the^- expressed  and can you doubt they had?

<p>may not those reasons still exist, and may they not

<p>have operated on the mind of Mr. Tierney when he
</p>
<p>came to the conclusion that the repeal of the union
</p>
<p>was necessary for the preservation and happiness of
</p>
<p>his country ? But the Attorney-General went fur-
</p>
<p>ther; he endeavoured to convince you that the mea-
</p>
<p>sure of repeal was impracticable and unattainable. I
</p>
<p>knownothingthat could result from that lineof argu-
</p>
<p>ment, but to make you doubt the sincerity of those
</p>
<p>who advocated the measure, and undoubtedly if men
</p>
<p>do look after what is impracticable or unattainable,
</p>
<p>their sincerity may be questioned. But, gentlemen, it
</p>
<p>appears to me monstrous to say, that any measure,
</p>
<p>after what we have all seen in our own times, should
</p>
<p>be considered as impracticable, no matter what dif-
</p>
<p>ficulties interposed. How many measures of great
</p>
<p>importance, in our own time, whicli appeared to have
</p>
<p>insuperable difiiculties to contend with, which yet
</p>
<p>have become the law of the land. Yon recollect the
</p>
<p>question of the slave trade, which Mr. I'itt de-
</p>
<p>fiounced as the greatest stain which ever disgraced
</p>
<p>or degraded mankind, yet that measure, supported
</p>
<p>as it w.os by liis mighty talent, and by that of Fox
</p>
<p>and Wilberforce, and recommended by every feeling
</p>
<p>of humanity, took years before it was possible to
</p>
<p>counteract the prejudice against it, and before it
</p>
<p>became the law of the land. The unwearied efibrts
</p>
<p>of Mr. Wilberforce to accomplish that measure can
</p>
<p>never be forgot ten -, he devoted to it the beet part
</p>
<p>of his useful life ; effort followed effort, defeat fol-
</p>
<p>lowed defeat, but he persevered. On his side was
</p>
<p>justice and humanity, against him was the selfish-
</p>
<p>ness of human interest. He stood between both, and
</p>
<p>the slave trade w.as abolished, and if I might be al-
</p>
<p>lowed to use an expression of his own, " he stood

<p>6eneral tlien persist iji telling you tli.at you should
</p>
<p>doubt the sincerity of the traversers, because emi-
</p>
<p>nent statesmen have expressed an opinion adverse to
</p>
<p>the measure of the repeal of the union ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>if then you believe that my client enteitained a con-
</p>
<p>scientious opinion of the injury and injustice of the
</p>
<p>union, I think you ivill have an honest and consti-
</p>
<p>tutional motive to which you can refer his conduct.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, let me come to the consideration of
</p>
<p>the acts imputed to him. If I recollect the evidence
</p>
<p>right, these acts are but two:  first, attending a
</p>
<p>meeting at Clontibret, on the 15th of August, and
</p>
<p>secondly, one at the association, on the ^rd of Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, in the same year. I believe I am correct when
</p>
<p>I say, that no act was imputed to liim except upon
</p>
<p>those two occasions, and if he is to be branded or con-
</p>
<p>vi(!ted as a conspirator, it will be on one or other or
</p>
<p>both of these two meetings to whicli I Iiave referred.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I will take both in their order, but be-
</p>
<p>fore I go to the meeting of the 13th of August, I
</p>
<p>must refer to a portion of the evidence given with
</p>
<p>regard to an alleged conversation wliich had taken
</p>
<p>place between Mr. Tierney and M'Cann, who was
</p>
<p>produced as a witness ; that conversation is stated
</p>
<p>to have taken place on the 16th of June, and I had
</p>
<p>better read to j'ou what I think was a correct report
</p>
<p>of what was alleged to have been said at that con-
</p>
<p>versation, begging you to recollect that this took
</p>
<p>place two months previous to the meeting. M'Cann
</p>
<p>told you he received instructions to go to Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney, to learn when the meeting was to be held.
</p>
<p>Accordingly he went to Mr. Tierney, and obtained

</p>
<p>nil the information it was in that gentleman's power
</p>
<p>to afford, namely, that he did not know the precise
</p>
<p>day on which the meeting was to take place ; then
</p>
<p>we are told by M'Cann, that in the course of the
</p>
<p>same conversation, Mr. Tierney adverted to the
</p>
<p>union that he said it had been fraudulently carried
</p>
<p>-^that it was not binding on the conscience  that he
</p>
<p>represented it to be a concoction  that he spoke of
</p>
<p>the feeling that was becoming general among the
</p>
<p>army-^that he declared that the army was favour-
</p>
<p>able to repeal, and partook of the enthusiasm of the
</p>
<p>people-^and that the army could not be so easily led
</p>
<p>to spill the blood of their fellow-men and that he
</p>
<p>referred to what the army had done in Spain. This,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, was the conversation sworn to, and the
</p>
<p>plain object of this evidence was to endeavour to
</p>
<p>implicate Mr. Tierney in the charge of seducing the
</p>
<p>army. I liave first to say to you on tlie part, and
</p>
<p>by the authority of Mr. Tierney, that lie does most
</p>
<p>positively and absolutely deny, that any single par-
</p>
<p>ticle of that alleged conversation ever took place.
</p>
<p>He acknowledges that M'Cann came to get infor-
</p>
<p>mation about the meeting  that he gave him that
</p>
<p>information, but he positively denies the truth of
</p>
<p>the residue of M'Cann's evidence as to this alleged
</p>
<p>conversation. I certainly am not able to produce
</p>
<p>any witness to contradict him, and why, because
</p>
<p>according to the testimony of MCann, there was no
</p>
<p>one present but himself and Mr. Tierney ; but I am
</p>
<p>glad for the sake of truth and justice, that I shall
</p>
<p>be able to convict M'Cann from his own lips, and
</p>
<p>upoii such facts and circumstances that it will be
</p>
<p>impossible that you can give one particle of credit
</p>
<p>to what has been said by him. In the first place is
</p>
<p>it not improbable if such a conversation took place,

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>there was no difficulty on the part of the crown, if
</p>
<p>they thought fit, in producing them, yet neither
</p>
<p>of them is produced. But in order to give you an
</p>
<p>account of the character of tlie meeting, the police-
</p>
<p>man is produced and the magistrate kept back.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I wish to cast no imputation upon the
</p>
<p>crown for so doing. I know uotits motives  I know
</p>
<p>not its reasons, yet I think that I am justified in
</p>
<p>saying this, that if those magistrates could have
</p>
<p>deposed to any single circumstance that would have
</p>
<p>been calculated to stamp the meeting with illegality,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General would have called them, and
</p>
<p>I am therefore entitled to assume that he found
</p>
<p>those persons would not be able to say anything
</p>
<p>which would serve the prosecution, but might say
</p>
<p>something that would prejudice it. Well, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that meeting took place, and not one of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers was present at it except Mr. Tierney. Not
</p>
<p>an iota or particle of connection is shown between
</p>
<p>him and the other traversers up to or at that time,
</p>
<p>yet he is alleged to have entered into a conspiracy
</p>
<p>and agreement with them. Are there any grounds
</p>
<p>for saying that this meeting was illegal? Was
</p>
<p>there an act of violence committed ? no ; was there
</p>
<p>anything done to show that the meeting was an il-
</p>
<p>legal assembly ? nothing. There was not one single
</p>
<p>particle of riot or disturbance  it was characterised
</p>
<p>by that which characterised all the other meetings
</p>
<p>was perfectly tranquil, perfectly peaceable  not a
</p>
<p>finger or hand was raised ; the utmost that is alleged
</p>
<p>is, that some of the people were crushed, and among
</p>
<p>them the policeman. If, gentlemen, the existence
</p>
<p>of a crush is to be the ground for attaching a charge

</p>
<p>of illegality to a meeting, I must say that the Court
</p>
<p>of Queen's Bench has held most illegal meetings for
</p>
<p>the last fortnight ; there has certainly been a consi-
</p>
<p>derable degree of crushing in the court during that
</p>
<p>time, and although, gentlemen, from your peculiar
</p>
<p>situation, you are guarded and protected from it, no
</p>
<p>other portion of the court has been free from crush-
</p>
<p>ing  I might say that even the judgment-seat has
</p>
<p>been invaded, I will not say cruslied, by those fair
</p>
<p>persons whom even ermined judges found it impos-
</p>
<p>sible to resist. The attorney-general calls upon you
</p>
<p>to pronounce this meeting illegal in order to connect
</p>
<p>my client with this conspiracy, for if the meeting
</p>
<p>was legal there is no ground for the charge against
</p>
<p>my cUent ; and, in order to make a particle of proof
</p>
<p>against him, it is necessary to establish that this
</p>
<p>meeting was illegal. I say you have not a single
</p>
<p>particle of evidence to show that this meeting was
</p>
<p>illegal. Gentlemen, I will tell you what the object
</p>
<p>of this meeting was  it was to adopt certain resolu-
</p>
<p>tions. Tlie first resolution was this : " Resolved
</p>
<p>that the legislative union was carried against the
</p>
<p>wiU of the Irish people." Look to the speeches of
</p>
<p>Lord Grey, and .you will find the self-same proposi-
</p>
<p>tion laid down by him. And after passing another
</p>
<p>resolution of much the same purport, a petition was
</p>
<p>drawn up to this effect : " That the legislative
</p>
<p>union haring operated to our injury, we request
</p>
<p>your honorable house to repeal said union." So that
</p>
<p>tills meeting, this perfectly tranquil, this perfectly
</p>
<p>peaceable meeting, having adopted resolutions, and
</p>
<p>expressed their opinion that this measure of a union
</p>
<p>was a bad one and ought to be repealed, and having
</p>
<p>exercised an undoubted legal and constitutional right,
</p>
<p>you are called on to say that my client was engaged

<p>officer a deep debt of gratitude ; he has received
</p>
<p>from him most important assistance on a late occa-
</p>
<p>(ion, and an opportunity will now be afforded to the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General for Ireland of repaying that debt.
</p>
<p>He can from his own experience here instruct him
</p>
<p>in the law of conspiracy ; and the Marquis of West-
</p>
<p>minster may be brought to the bar of the Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench as a conspirator; he may instruct him
</p>
<p>in the power of sneering away .the loyalty of
</p>
<p>his countrymen, and the anti-corn law league
</p>
<p>may be branded with the charge of disloyalty.
</p>
<p>I confess that mv client attended the meeting of the
</p>
<p>3d of October, that he handed in subscriptions;
</p>
<p>but he did more, he made a speech, and that has
</p>
<p>been put upOn record in the indictment, I suppose,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of handing down that specimen of
</p>
<p>eloquence to posterity. I have read that speech
</p>
<p>very attentively, and I find in it a long historical
</p>
<p>allusion to the parish in which he lived. He ap-
</p>
<p>pears to be deeply versed in the history of that
</p>
<p>parish ; he had, as might naturally be expected, a
</p>
<p>deep interest in it ; and I have no doubt the parish
</p>
<p>of Clontibret stands as high in his estimation as the
</p>
<p>field either of Blenheim or Waterloo. He then
</p>
<p>comes up to the association, and falls into the pre-
</p>
<p>vailing and besetting sin of Irishmen, that of speech-
</p>
<p>making ; he displays his historic lore, he dilates on
</p>
<p>the history of the parish of Clontibret, and therefore
</p>
<p>he is a conspirator. But, says the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, he talked of deeds not words  of hands and
</p>
<p>Jiearts. Why these are but the ordinary expressions
</p>
<p>of a man of sincerity when proffering assistance 
</p>
<p>what more natural than for a man to say you shall

</p>
<p>have every assistance both of hand and heart?
</p>
<p>However, the Attorney-General says that Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney talked of deeds, and that he meant deeds of
</p>
<p>violence, and that when he alluded to hands he
</p>
<p>meant hands with arms in them. What right has
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General to put such an interpretation
</p>
<p>upon the words of my chent? On the part of my
</p>
<p>client I repudiate such a construction. I deny that
</p>
<p>there was anything in his words to warrant such
</p>
<p>a construction. It is not for you or me to pro-
</p>
<p>nounce with certainty on the motives of any man 
</p>
<p>this is for the Almighty alone, the great searcher of
</p>
<p>hearts, who can alone judge of the true motives of
</p>
<p>an individual ; but when man comes to judge of the
</p>
<p>motives of his fellow-man, he must look to his acts
</p>
<p>and conduct alone for their elucidation. And it
</p>
<p>does appear to me to be a gross violation of charity
</p>
<p>to pervert and strain the meaning of words in order
</p>
<p>to fasten a bad motive on your fellow-being. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlen, I lay these matters before you, and without
</p>
<p>fear I confidently appeal to the conduct and acts of
</p>
<p>my client ; and I say mthout hesitation I shall be
</p>
<p>most grievously disappointed if you, gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, shall come to the conclusion that my client
</p>
<p>is guilty. I have now stated to you the facts and
</p>
<p>circumstances on which I rely for your verdict ; and
</p>
<p>if you agree with me in the view which I have taken,
</p>
<p>and come to a conclusion that my client is entitled
</p>
<p>to a verdict of acquittal, I feel confident that it is a
</p>
<p>verdict you will be able to justify to your country
</p>
<p>now, and to your God hereafter.

<p>to create disaffection towards the government and

</p>
<p>permit me, in furtherance of that view, to refer to
</p>
<p>the opinion of the eminent judge who charged the
</p>
<p>grand jury in the case of Mr. Thomas Hardy. Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Eyre, in calling the attention of the
</p>
<p>jury to the question they had to try, said
</p>
<p>Judge Burton  What do you take that from ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell From the State Trials, vol. 24.
</p>
<p>Your lordship will find it in page 205. You are

<p>aware, gentlemen, from what has been already

</p>
<p>barked in sucli designs as that which I have already
</p>
<p>considered. Whether this be so or not is a mere
</p>
<p>matter of fact, as to which I shall only remind you
</p>
<p>that an inquiry into a charge of this nature which
</p>
<p>undertakes to make out that the ostensible purpose
</p>
<p>is a mere veil under which is concealed a traitorous
</p>
<p> conspiracy, requires cool and deliberate considera-
</p>
<p>tion, and that the result should be perfectly clear and
</p>
<p>satisfactory. In the affairs of common life no man is
</p>
<p>perfectly justified in imputing to another person a
</p>
<p>meaning contrary to what he himself expresses, but
</p>
<p>upon the fullest evidence." Gentlemen, no man has
</p>
<p> right to impute to another that he is not intending
</p>
<p>what he professes to do, unless there is clear, satis-
</p>
<p>factory, and unambiguous evidence to show the con-
</p>
<p>trary. Every man must be presumed to be acting
</p>
<p>according to his declared intentions until the con-
</p>
<p>trary is proved. Every man is presuiiied by the
</p>
<p>Jaw of the land to be innocent before his guilt is
</p>
<p>plearly established ; and, as already observed to you
</p>
<p>by Mr. Moore, if there be a criminal intent alleged,
</p>
<p>fmd if there be a legal intent to which the acts of
</p>
<p>the party can be truly attributable, common justice
</p>
<p>r^the spirit of the British law  requires that his
</p>
<p>acts should be attributed to the legal and innocent
</p>
<p>motive, and not by straining to a criminal intent.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, you have a right to go fur-
</p>
<p>ther  according to the spirit of the British law if it
</p>

<p>Vest field tliat was to open, nnd the length of time it
</p>
<p>was to occupy they never would have engaged in it
</p>
<p>for I defy any man not enlightened by tlie divine
</p>
<p>Spirit to say with the precision and certainty of an
</p>
<p>English judge deciding upon evidence before him,
</p>
<p>that Mr. Hastings is guilty or not guilty ; for who
</p>
<p>knows what is before him or what is not ? Many
</p>
<p>have carried what they knew to their graves, and
</p>
<p>thd living have lived long enough to forget it. In-
</p>
<p>deed, I pray to God that such anotlier proceeding
</p>
<p>may never exist in England, because I consider it a
</p>
<p>dishonour to the consitution, and that it brings, by
</p>
<p>its example, insecurity into the .idministration of
</p>
<p>justice. Every man in civilised society has a right
</p>
<p>to hold his lift', liberty, and reputation under plain
</p>
<p>laws. That can be well understood, and is entitled
</p>
<p>to have some limited specific part  his conduct com-
</p>
<p>pared and examined by their standard, and that
</p>
<p>he ought not for seven years, no, nor for seven
</p>
<p>days, to stand as a criminal before the highest
</p>
<p>tribunal until judgment is bewildered and con-
</p>
<p>founded, to come at last, perhaps, to defend him-
</p>
<p>self broken down by fatigue, and dispirited with
</p>
<p>anxiety." Such was the language of the acute and
</p>
<p>impassionate Erskine in comparing the proceedings
</p>
<p>in Hardy's case with the proceedings which had been
</p>
<p>instituted against Warren Hastings, and yet I have
</p>
<p>no hesitation in averring that in Hardy's case the
</p>
<p>parties charged were few, and the circumslances
</p>
<p>were few as compared with the number of the ac-

<p>victim, in being called upon to become responsible
</p>
<p>for the words and actions of other men beside him-
</p>
<p>self during the period of seven months. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the task is indeed arduous which the crown has im-
</p>
<p>posed upon you. You are called upon to jump at
</p>
<p>the con<;lusion, but everything that my client did in
</p>
<p>his capacity of paid otficer to the society was done,
</p>
<p>not in the conscientious discharge of his duties as a
</p>
<p>paid servant, but with a criminal intent to pervert
</p>
<p>the law and injure the constitution of the country.
</p>
<p>Tliat you are sworn to try  at that conclusion you are
</p>
<p>required to arrive. Gentlemen, I feel embarrassed
</p>
<p>in addressing you ; I confess that I am adverse to
</p>
<p>going over the same ground that Mr. Moore has
</p>
<p>traversed in his eloquent rem'arks, for I am appre-
</p>
<p>hensive that a repetition of the same topics by me,
</p>
<p>instead of being of value to you or to my client,
</p>
<p>would rather have the effect of weakening the im-
</p>
<p>pression that must have been produced upon your
</p>
<p>-jninds by the admirable speech of my learned friend.
</p>
<p>But I cannot avoid offering a few remarks to which
</p>
<p>I would fain attract your most serious attention in
</p>
<p>reference to the particular case of my client, Mr.
</p>
<p>Bay. Gentlemen, look at the position in which my
</p>
<p>slient is placed, and have regard to the circ.um-
</p>
<p>gtancesby which his particular case is characterised.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. Ray is an humble man with a large
</p>
<p>^'amily, who look to him alone for support. He has
</p>
<p>no other pursuits tliau those which are connected
</p>
<p>with his avocations in office. He was made secretary
</p>
<p>to the repeal association on its formation in the year
</p>
<p>1840, and from the day of his appointment to the
</p>
<p>present hour his time and attention have been totally
</p>
<p>engaged by the discharge of the duties incidental to

<p>his situation. He has not giveu me the slightest

<p>THE IRISTl STATE TRIALS.

<p>Were accotdingly obliged to avail themselves of the
</p>
<p>ordinary newspaper reports, which did not publish
</p>
<p>all the transactions of the meetings, but only such
</p>
<p>of them as appeared at the time of public interest. .
</p>
<p>They thus were obliged to resort to a species of se-
</p>
<p>condary evidence, and in order to make that evidence
</p>
<p>admissible they were obliged to have recourse to the
</p>
<p>left-handed management of including in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment the editors of the different newspapers in which
</p>
<p>these reports were published. What was the course
</p>
<p>taken at the trial of Home Tooke ? Who was the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General of England in that day? the late
</p>
<p>Lord Eldon, then Mr. Scott. Who was the Solici-
</p>
<p>tor-General of that day ? the late Lord Redes-
</p>
<p>dale, subsequently Lord Chancellor of Ireland,
</p>
<p>then Mr. Mitford. How did they proceed against
</p>
<p>Home Tooke? Who was the first witness exa-
</p>
<p>mined against Home Tooke ? Daniel Adams,
</p>
<p>who was sworn and examined by the counsel for
</p>
<p>the crown. And what does he prove ? that he was
</p>
<p>the secretary of this society or association  that he
</p>
<p>liad held that oflSce for ten years  that he had made
</p>
<p>the entries in the books. But the crown may say
</p>
<p>to us here  " Oh ! do you expect we should call a
</p>
<p>co-conspirator ? do you expect that we should give
</p>
<p>to your counsel the benefit of his cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion?" Gentlemen, I hold it to be a principle  an
</p>
<p>inherent principle  of a crown prosecution, and
</p>
<p>more particularly of a state prosecution, I hold it
</p>
<p>to be the duty of those who manage it not to dis-
</p>
<p>criminate, to judge, to calculate, to criticise in what
</p>
<p>way the evidence may be likely to affect those who
</p>
<p>are to be prosecuted ; but it is the duty of the crown

</p>
<p>to call all those witnesses who can depose to facts
</p>
<p>appertaining to the prosecution, and then to give
</p>
<p>the traversers the benefit of their cross-examination.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray is included in tliis indictment ; he cannot
</p>
<p>be a witness at all ; I cannot call him for himself
</p>
<p>the other traversers cannot examine him on their
</p>
<p>behalf. In Home Tooke's case the crown did not in-
</p>
<p>dict the secretary j he was the first witness to prove
</p>
<p>the objects, the intent, and the tendency of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation. Home Tooke was entitled to the cross-
</p>
<p>examination of the witness produced by the crown ;
</p>
<p>he had the secretary of the society on the table to
</p>
<p>interrogate him as to the intent and objects of it.
</p>
<p>One of his questions was, " Were the members
</p>
<p>armed with pikes or muskets ? No. Did you ever
</p>
<p>hear anything said in the society about pikes or
</p>
<p>muskets ? No, never in my life. Was there such
</p>
<p>a thing as a secret committee there ? Never. Was
</p>
<p>not everything conducted openly and publicly ? Was
</p>
<p>there anything ever took place which could lead you
</p>
<p>to believe that the members intended to depose or
</p>
<p>kill the king? Oh, no, never." Would I not, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, have been entitled to ask Mr. Itay if he was
</p>
<p>a witness on the table, " Had you any reason to
</p>
<p>suppose that the members of the loyal national re-
</p>
<p>peal association intended to excite disaffection to-
</p>
<p>wards the government, or to corrupt the army, to
</p>
<p>affect the administration of justice, or to overthrow
</p>
<p>the government ?" Why have we not the opportu-
</p>
<p>nity of asking those questions, which we might have
</p>
<p>done if we had the benefit of his testimony. Such
</p>
<p>was the course that was taken when those prosecu-
</p>
<p>tions were being carried on in England, at a time
</p>
<p>when the armies of France were sweeping the con-
</p>
<p>tinent of Europe, and when there were great dis-

<p>299
</p>
<p>like it there. To be sure Captain Despard was
</p>
<p>examined, but what was his evidence ? Why was
</p>
<p>it given ? I will toll you : it was in order to give a
</p>
<p>certain colouring to this case  a colouring of ille-
</p>
<p>gality to that great meeting, and that you might
</p>
<p>draw inferences from that evidence that the meet-
</p>
<p>ing was illegal. Well, then, AValker was examined,
</p>
<p>and what did he prove ? That he saw people walk-
</p>
<p>ing, heard bands playing, and saw a few flags or
</p>
<p>banners, and that was all he saw. Was thei'e any-
</p>
<p>thing illegal in that ? Walker was examined by the
</p>
<p>crown on all that he was supposed to know. M'^ell,
</p>
<p>Captain Despard, who, it would be recollected, had
</p>
<p>no great regard or esteem for Mr. O'Connell  for
</p>
<p>what reason, I suppose, he knows best himself 
</p>
<p>but it was quite clear that, from his manner and
</p>
<p>evidence, he had a very strong feeling against Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell and the meeting. This Captain Despard
</p>
<p>comes from Trim, and he swears he heard the peo-
</p>
<p>ple say " Keep the step!" I asked him did they
</p>
<p>keep the step, and he said they did not. I must
</p>
<p>hereremark that every policeman who was examined
</p>
<p>did, either by design or accident, endeavour in the
</p>
<p>strongest manner to give a colouring of a military
</p>
<p>character, which they were not wan-anted in giving,
</p>
<p>to the whole of those meetings. Captain Despard
</p>
<p>said the people came in marching order to the meet-
</p>
<p>ing, and by that word he wanted to impress some-
</p>
<p>thing on your minds relative to military array. He
</p>
<p>was obhged to admit that the people did not keep
</p>
<p>the step, nor did they know how to keep it. He
</p>
<p>was a military man, and he at once committed him-
</p>
<p>self in liis anxiety to coloiu- the case, and give a

</p>
<p>turn to the whole proceedings, which were totally
</p>
<p>different from the facts. It was most disingenuous
</p>
<p>in Despard to use a military term for the purpose of
</p>
<p>throwing it into your box ; but, at the same time,
</p>
<p>it only proves the warmth of his temper, and the
</p>
<p>bias of his mind, and his partizanship on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject. I will ask are men to be branded with being
</p>
<p>foul conspirators  are their lives, liberties, and for-
</p>
<p>tunes to be at stake in consequence of such evi-
</p>
<p>dence as this that I have shown you? Captain
</p>
<p>Despard and Major Westenra were taken for foreign-
</p>
<p>ers, " because," says the captain, " Major Westenra
</p>
<p>had a mustache, and I had a curl in my lip"
</p>
<p>(laughter). Well, he gets into a conversation with
</p>
<p>some country fellow, who was waiting to see Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell pass, and because of this conversation the
</p>
<p>meeting was stigmatised as illegal. The man told
</p>
<p>him he came from Wexford, and therefore the meet-
</p>
<p>ing was illegal, and the traversers guilty of a foul
</p>
<p>conspiracy (laughter). This alleged conversation
</p>
<p>could have been sustained by evidence, but I think
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General knew nothingaboutitwhen he
</p>
<p>opened the case, or if he did I think he did well to
</p>
<p>leave it out and not contaminate his case with such
</p>
<p>trash as I allude to. The Attorney-General did not
</p>
<p>allude to 2,000 Shilmalier men who marched to
</p>
<p>Tara. Oh, no, he knew it would be really too far-
</p>
<p>cical to do so. The conversation to which he re-
</p>
<p>ferred, must be treated as a humbug or bantering
</p>
<p>conversation between Captain Despard and the
</p>
<p>countryman. Walker was examined before Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Despard, and it was said also that he was near
</p>
<p>him when the conversation took place, yet there
</p>
<p>was not a word about it, but the 2,000 Wexfordmen
</p>
<p>could not be forgotten by Captain Despard. This

<p>duced in eridence of a conspiracy, when it was
</p>
<p>sought to make each conspirator responsible for the
</p>
<p>acts of his co-conspirators. Was it to he endured
</p>
<p>that such a document, sold by this person, whose
</p>
<p>character was blackened as a vender of feditious pub-
</p>
<p>lications, for profit and hire, should be received in
</p>
<p>evidence, and the person himself not produced.
</p>
<p>Mr. Broivne was the regular and recognised
</p>
<p>printer of the association, who printed for the repeal
</p>
<p>wardens, and a variety of documents for which he
</p>
<p>was paid. The cro^vn had the benefit of his evi-
</p>
<p>dence ; but why did the Attorney-General close his
</p>
<p>case, having this document in his pofsession, with-
</p>
<p>out calling the person who sold them to show how
</p>
<p>he got them  whether he was a member of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation, or who paid for them ? Yet the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General calls on you to assume, to infer, and pre-
</p>
<p>sume, that he was a member of the association. If
</p>
<p>the object of the crown was to arrive at the truth,
</p>
<p>it was their bounden duty to produce this seditious
</p>
<p>Tender of infamous publications. Do you tliink that
</p>
<p>Mr. Kemmis, the respectable solicitor for the crown,
</p>
<p>than whom no man discharges his duty more faith-
</p>
<p>fully, was not instructed as to who he was and what
</p>
<p>he was? Why, I again repeat, was not this vender
</p>
<p>of sedition produced ? He could have told us whe-
</p>
<p>ther he was a member of the association, or from
</p>
<p>what he composed this paper. Every one knows
</p>
<p>that even at the assizes such songs and publications
</p>
<p>were sold by wretched paupers at the corners of the
</p>
<p>streets. He knew that the Attorney-General would
</p>
<p>not have suggested any course that should have the
</p>
<p>effect of making the traversers fall into a trap, or

<p>one by which they would be compelled to call a wit-
</p>
<p>ness, of whom the traversers knew nothing, and of
</p>
<p>whom the crown might possibly know much. Such
</p>
<p>an imputation was utterly unworthy of them, he
</p>
<p>need not even suggest it against his learned friends,
</p>
<p>and he should only be brought to think so, if he
</p>
<p>should hear the Solicitor-General say, in liis reply,
</p>
<p>that the traversers ought to call as their witness this
</p>
<p>vender of sedition. We can all understand that an
</p>
<p>indictment for conspiracy might be justifiable, or
</p>
<p>the only proceeding by which individuals could be
</p>
<p>punished in certain cases. In proceeding against
</p>
<p>private individuals for doing a private wrong, it
</p>
<p>might be necessary to indict persons for a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>'J^vo persons might conspire to rob a mau of his
</p>
<p>property, and in such a case the concert of their acts
</p>
<p>might be taken as the only evidence of their con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Men might be charged with offences of
</p>
<p>another character, and an indictment for conspiracy
</p>
<p>might here too be the only remedy. But the law of
</p>
<p>the constitution looked with jealousy on the doc-
</p>
<p>trine of conspiracy being resorted lo as a political
</p>
<p>instrument in a state prosecution ; and I again re-
</p>
<p>peat that it becomes a still more obnoxious proceed-
</p>
<p>ingone to be discarded and scouted from a court
</p>
<p>of justice, wlien an indictment is founded on three
</p>
<p>hundred separate acts. The learned gentleman
</p>
<p>then cited the case of Henry Hunt, before referred
</p>
<p>to ; it was an indictment against Hunt and nine
</p>
<p>others, on several counts, for a conspiracy to disturb
</p>
<p>the peace and tranquillity of the country, and to ex-
</p>
<p>cite discontent, disaffection, and hatred of the law

<p>to press Mr. Fitzgibbon to go on ; he had observed
</p>
<p>that he had been labouring under a severe cold dur-
</p>
<p>ing a great part of this trial. The court all felt that
</p>
<p>no undue time had hitherto been taken up by the se-
</p>
<p>veral gentlemen who had addressed the court and
</p>
<p>the jury, neither of whom could complain of the
</p>
<p>conduct of the counsel. This was an additional
</p>
<p>reason why Mr. Fitzgibbon's request to begin his ad-
</p>
<p>dress to-morrow instead ofto-day should be conceded.
</p>
<p>The court would, therefore, adjourn till to-morrow.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General said he could not for a mo-
</p>
<p>ment press Mr. Fitzgibbon to go on, but Mr. White-
</p>
<p>eide and Mr. M'Donogh still had to address the
</p>
<p>court, and he thought one of them might go on.
</p>
<p>One of the traversers, he understood, was to address
</p>
<p>the court himself. He admitted that the illness of
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon was quite a sufficient reason for his
</p>
<p>not addressing the jury, but he thought it might be
</p>
<p>desirable that one of the other gentlemen should
</p>
<p>do so.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon said the court had been kind
</p>
<p>enough to take his indisposition into consideration
</p>
<p>as one of the ingredients of its decision. But he did
</p>
<p>not found his application entirely upon that. If they
</p>
<p>forced him to go on, he would be prepared ; and if
</p>
<p>there were no other reasons but his personal con-
</p>
<p>venience, he should beg them not to make their rule
</p>
<p>merely upon that.

<p>MB. FITZGIBBON, Q.C., IN DEFENCE OF DR. CBAT.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon in addressing the jury said  If it
</p>
<p>please your lordships and gentlemen, in this case-:-
</p>
<p>on this, the beginning of the fourteenth day of this
</p>
<p>trial  the duty falls upon me of addressing you on
</p>
<p>behalf of one of the traversers. Dr. Gray. From
</p>
<p>the course adopted by the croim in thus uniting
</p>
<p>eight indinduals, and putting them together on
</p>
<p>their trial, it necessarily results that each of those
</p>
<p>individuals, having the privilege of making a sepa-
</p>
<p>rate defence, may be heard by his own counsel.
</p>
<p>But from the evidence that has been laid before you,
</p>
<p>and from the nature of this case, it is plain that it is
</p>
<p>impossible to separate the cases of those defendants,
</p>
<p>and impossible to mike, with any effect, an indivi-
</p>
<p>dual and distinct case for each. It is too plain that
</p>
<p>tliis must be dealt with as one case. It is a charge
</p>
<p>for a joint offence  it is a charge for an offence that
</p>
<p>cannot be committed by a single person  it is a
</p>
<p>charge for an offence in its very nature involving
</p>
<p>the necessity of more than one criminal, if any there
</p>
<p>be at all I therefore, gentlemen, do not intend, nor
</p>
<p>is it at all the instruction of my client, that I should
</p>
<p>intend to separate the case of Dr. Gray from that
</p>
<p>of the other traversers. Gentlemen, you will ob-
</p>
<p>serve that this is a charge against those eight de-
</p>
<p>fendants, that they unlawfully, and maliciously,
</p>
<p>and criminally, conspired together. That seems in

<p>approach this case simply as a lawyer ; and if my
</p>
<p>conviction be that this prosecution is an unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional, an illegal, and an unfair attempt, now in the
</p>
<p>year 1844, to devise a ministerial scourge for the
</p>
<p>purpose of lashing a free people  if it be my opinion
</p>
<p>that the possession of this ministerial scourge is
</p>
<p>pursued by means illegal, unjust, and unfair, I ask
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen, again, what a duty have I placed be-
</p>
<p>fore me ! The conductors of this prosecution, the
</p>
<p>three firet men in my profession in point of rank,
</p>
<p>are the persons who are pursuing this object.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, of all those members of my profession,
</p>
<p>as individuals, so far as I have any personal know-
</p>
<p>ledge of them, Iwill speak of as gentlemen, severally,
</p>
<p>respectively, and individually, in the most dignified
</p>
<p>and highest possible sense of that word. As lawyers,
</p>
<p>as far as I have had to do with them, I can con-
</p>
<p>scientiously declare it as my opinion that they are
</p>
<p>worthy of the very highest eulogy that language
</p>
<p>can convey. I speak of them as lawyers in the best
</p>
<p>sense of the word, and I sliould be oBering an indig-
</p>
<p>nity to my own profession were I not to avow that
</p>
<p>such an admission includes almost everj'thiug that
</p>
<p>can be said in praise of any man. But if I have

<p>spoken in such terms of those three distinguished
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I have spoken of them as I have ob-
</p>
<p>served them in common matters and common cases.
</p>
<p>It has never before been my lot either to be con-
</p>
<p>cerned in or to have witnessed in a court of justice
</p>
<p>a state prosecution ; but it has frequently come
</p>
<p>within the range of my legal studies to read of many
</p>
<p>Buch cases, and from the perusal of them I have
</p>
<p>gathered this information, that if the three eminent
</p>
<p>gentlemen, to whom I have alluded, have fallen
</p>
<p>from that moral dignity which, iu all other passages
</p>
<p>of their lives, as far as I have ever seen, they have
</p>
<p>honourably upheld, they have but followed the ex-
</p>
<p>ample of a greater man than any of them. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I say this nithout disparagement to them,
</p>
<p>or to any member of my profession at present iu
</p>
<p>existence. They have but followed in the footsteps
</p>
<p>of the .great Lord Coke himself, whose eminent
</p>
<p>virtues and high dignity as a lawyer were not proof
</p>
<p>against the,personal feelings which, in all cases,
</p>
<p>have governed the conduct of state lawyers in a
</p>
<p>state prosecution.,' .Even the name of the illustrious
</p>
<p>Lord Coke has come down to posterity with a " dis-
</p>
<p>honouring blot," by reason of a state prosecution,
</p>
<p>for no friend of humanity can read, without feelings
</p>
<p>of execration, disgust, and indignation, his attack
</p>
<p>upon Sir Walter Raleigh. If those who conduct
</p>
<p>the present prosecution have fallen, therefore, from
</p>
<p>their high estate, it is not they alone who have been
</p>
<p>dishonoured. Gentlemen, I have told you that, in
</p>
<p>my opinion, tliis prosecution has been carried on
</p>
<p>unfairly. Yes, I use the word advisedly  carried
</p>
<p>on unfairly by the three gentlemen who are at the
</p>
<p>head of these proceedings, and by their assistants,
</p>
<p>of whom I may presently have much to saj'. Yes,

</p>
<p>criminal cases ; but in respect to the actual guilt or
</p>
<p>iunoceuce of an accused party it never, never ought
</p>
<p>to be given. Why does the law take from the court
</p>
<p>the decision of guilt or innocence, and why does
</p>
<p>the law place the jurisdiction in twelve men selected
</p>
<p>from society ? Because guilt or innocence is never
</p>
<p>to be treated by technicalities  never to be treated
</p>
<p>as a question of science. It is never, therefore, a
</p>
<p>mere question of law, which is a species of science ;
</p>
<p>it is a question of moralit)', a question of mind, of
</p>
<p>intention, and of feeling ; therefore, a jury is the
</p>
<p>proper instrument through which that question is to
</p>
<p>be decided ; and, therefore, it is that they who have
</p>
<p>to pronounce upon it are taken from among their
</p>
<p>fellow-men, because they are not technically in-
</p>
<p>structed in this or that profession, and the law has
</p>
<p>wisely determined that they are best calculated to
</p>
<p>scrutinize and pronounce upon the actions of ordi-
</p>
<p>nary men like themselves. I say, therefore, that
</p>
<p>witii the question of guilt or innocence the court
</p>
<p>has nothing to do. When you are required to pro-
</p>
<p>nounce on the guilt or innocence of an accused
</p>
<p>party, the opinion of the judge goes into your box
</p>
<p>with little more weight than that of any other in-
</p>
<p>dividual liable to be wrong would carry with it.
</p>
<p>The law says that each and every one of you is a
</p>
<p>better judge of that all-important question, the
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence of the traversers, than any other
</p>
<p>men in the land : therefore, gentlemen, the law
</p>
<p>placing that in your hands, and calling on you to
</p>
<p>give your verdict, it is for you carefully and jea-
</p>
<p>lously to examine the opinions which any man ad-
</p>
<p>dresses to you, and to be conscious that you don't

</p>
<p>entertain it for more than its intrinsic worth. This,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I submit to you, subject to the direction
</p>
<p>of the court  I submit that j'ou are to be your-
</p>
<p>selves guided by your unbiassed common sense in
</p>
<p>coming to the conclusion of the guilt or innocence
</p>
<p>of my client. Gentlemen, having told you that you
</p>
<p>should take the law from the court, the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General then proceeded, subject, as he admitted, to
</p>
<p>the correction of the court, and he then stated to
</p>
<p>you what was the law of conspiracy. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I do not agree with him in his statement of the law.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be said to me but I think that
</p>
<p>would be no answer  that my learned friend, Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore, yesterday admitted that the law as stated by
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General was the law. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore stood here as counsel for the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney, and his was a peculiar case. 1 cannot, on
</p>
<p>the part of Doctor Gray, make out that peculiar
</p>
<p>case, and I have, therefore, first to deal with this
</p>
<p>great question is there a conspiracy at all ? It then
</p>
<p>becomes necessary for me to take up this question
</p>
<p>of law which is yet untouched before you, and to
</p>
<p>expose to you the monstrous absurdity  and I think
</p>
<p>I can do so as clearly as ever I demonstrated a pro-
</p>
<p>position of Euclid  the monstrous absurdity that
</p>
<p>would follow from the law as laid down by the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General. Gentlemen, you have heard a par-
</p>
<p>ticular phrase frequently made use of during the
</p>
<p>progress of this case. You have heard of ' ' overt
</p>
<p>acts ;" over and over again has it been rung in your
</p>
<p>ears. Let me now suggest this question to each of you
</p>
<p>to ask himself  Does heat this moment, does any one
</p>
<p>of the twelve gentlemen I have the honour to address,
</p>
<p>entertain the remotest idea of what is the meaning
</p>
<p>of an overt act? Gentlemen, that word overt act oc-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.

<p>Hill of Tara, and the Attorney-General says that it
</p>
<p>is illegal because they all had agreed to call that
</p>
<p>meeting, and therefore they are guilty of a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. If the meeting was illegal, and that the par-
</p>
<p>ties agreed in calling that illegal meeting, then they
</p>
<p>were guilty, and the law called that a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Another portion of the Attorney-General's speech
</p>
<p>was this, that if two or more of the parties agreed to
</p>
<p>do a legal act in an illegal manner then they are also
</p>
<p>guilty of a conspiracy. The Attorney-General ad-
</p>
<p>mitted it was legal to meet and petition parliament
</p>
<p>for a repeal of the union, and he said he admitted
</p>
<p>that to the fullest extent. It would he legal for the
</p>
<p>defendants to make that thtir object, but the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General said they were pursuing that object
</p>
<p>by illegal means, by calling illegal meetings and
</p>
<p>publishing seditious speeches, and therefore they
</p>
<p>were all concurring in procuring a repeal of the union
</p>
<p>by illegal means. This is the law as laid down by
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General  that is the law I have to deal
</p>
<p>with. I own when I heard that law propounded in
</p>
<p>a court of justice it startled me a good deal. Ah !
</p>
<p>but the Attorney-General did come here with some
</p>
<p>authorities. Gentlemen, Mr. O'Connell, whose coun-
</p>
<p>tenance I am so desirous to have, and whose assist-
</p>
<p>ance to suggest to me or restrain me I would value
</p>
<p>exceedingly, has just told me he is obliged to go
</p>
<p>away. I am sorry to lose his countenance and as-
</p>
<p>sistance, but must endeavour to do my duty without
</p>
<p>hira. Gentlemen, the Attorney-General read his
</p>
<p>law from a book of course it becomes vitally neces-
</p>
<p>Bary to examine the history of that law, and see

<p>how it has got into that book. Give me your atten-

<p>tion. There is the indictment (holding it up)  you
</p>
<p>are told that is an indictment at common law, and it
</p>
<p>becomes necessary to examine what the meaning of
</p>
<p>that is. It means that it is an indictment which,
</p>
<p>on a similar state of facts to the present, could be
</p>
<p>sustained in tbe reign of Edward the Confessor 
</p>
<p>could be sustained before the conquest  inthe time
</p>
<p>of Edward, a good old king, whose laws the people
</p>
<p>have been bound to obey from that period to the
</p>
<p>present. I tell you, gentlemen of the jury, that is
</p>
<p>the meaning of the words common law. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>will you not be surprised to hear that, from the time
</p>
<p>of Edward up to the year 1794, there never was in
</p>
<p>England an instance of the members of an associa-
</p>
<p>tion  aye, from the days of Wat Tyler, there has
</p>
<p>not been an instance of an indictment for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against the members of an association of this
</p>
<p>kind. Is not that an astounding fact, that the crime
</p>
<p>of conspiracy was not known in those days ? Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the law of conspiracy at an early period be-
</p>
<p>came an object of great solicitude. It was a crime
</p>
<p>too dangerous to be left undefined, and one calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to be taken hold of as a ministerial scourge,
</p>
<p>and accordingly, it very early became the subject of
</p>
<p>statutable legislation. In the first volume of Haw-
</p>
<p>kin's Pleas, I find a proper definition of a conspiracy,
</p>
<p>which I will read for you :  " For the better under-
</p>
<p>standing the nature of a conspiracy, I shall consider,
</p>
<p>first, who may be said to be guilty of a conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>second, in what manner such offenders are to be pun-
</p>
<p>ished. As t6 the first point  who may be said to be'
</p>
<p>guilty of conspiracy there can be no better rule
</p>
<p>than the statute, the 33d, or rather the 21st of
</p>
<p>Edward I., the intent of which was to make a final
</p>
<p>definition of conspirators. Conspirators be they that

<p>Lord Denman spoke these worde in giving judgment
</p>
<p>against the indictment  " Tlie indictment ought to
</p>
<p>charge conspiracy either to do an unlawful act, or
</p>
<p>a lawful act by unlawful means." There is the au-
</p>
<p>thority the Attorney- General cited. No doubt Lord
</p>
<p>Denmau is a very able and a very constitutional
</p>
<p>judge, and no doubt those were the words he used ;
</p>
<p>but let me tell you the value that is to be attached
</p>
<p>to the saying of a judge under such circumstances.
</p>
<p>Mind, now, that is not a decision, nor is it the de-
</p>
<p>cision of the court of which he was a member  it
</p>
<p>is what we call technically a dictum  in plain Eng-
</p>
<p>lish a saying, and no constitutional judge will ever
</p>
<p>pay much attention to such a thing ; and I believe
</p>
<p>the true value of these ipsi dixits of judges was ne-
</p>
<p>ver more fully described than it was in this country
</p>
<p>by a very able man. Sir Anthony Hart, who, when
</p>
<p>somebody was pressing him with the diclum of a
</p>
<p>judge, said " he always thought that dictvms were
</p>
<p>an attempt at the bar to mislead one judge by mis-
</p>
<p>representing another." And I remember more than
</p>
<p>once to have heard a judge of equal ability, the pre-
</p>
<p>sent Baron Fennefather, repudiate and repress the
</p>
<p>. habit of citing in one case what a judge has said in
</p>
<p>another case, and for this reason  this plain reason 
</p>
<p>that what is said by a judge in a particular case is
</p>
<p>Baid in reference to the facts of that case, and is not
</p>
<p>said by any means as laying down a general law to
</p>
<p>affect cases that may be composed of very different
</p>
<p>facts. It was in 1832 that Lord Denman used the
</p>
<p>words I have already repeated to you ; and in 1834
</p>
<p>the same judge (and I wonder much the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General did not make use of the fact), in the case

<p>of the King against Seymour, 1st Adolphus and
</p>
<p>Ellis, page ?13, which was an indictment for con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to exonerate one parish from a pauper, and
</p>
<p>to throw him upon another, again spoke the same
</p>
<p>dictum that he had spoken on the previous trial, in
</p>
<p>granting the motion for an arrest of judgment. It
</p>
<p>BO happened, in 1839, that another case came before
</p>
<p>the same Chief Justice ; it was a case in which a set
</p>
<p>of cheats were indicted for opening a shop to defraud
</p>
<p>the people. The jury convicted them, and there
</p>
<p>was a motion made to arrest the judgment, because
</p>
<p>it was not properly within the law of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Lord Penman's dictum was cited to him by counsel
</p>
<p>to uphold that indictment, and what was his lord-
</p>
<p>ship's observation ? It was this  " I do not think
</p>
<p>the antithesis is very correct," and he disregarded
</p>
<p>his own dictum, and the judgment was arrested ; and,
</p>
<p>so far as his authority goes, there is the weight of

<p>it as to that dictuih.

<p>also the dictum of an equally able judge, the late
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice Bushe, in the case of the King
</p>
<p>V. Forbes ; he stated, in charging the jury, " the

<p>nature of a conspiracy is now to be described."

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>The mcfttiiigs may be evidence in this case as an
</p>
<p>overt act, that is, they may be evidence showing
</p>
<p>that that meeting could not iiave taken place unless
</p>
<p>there had been a previous conspiracy, and a pre-
</p>
<p>vious conspiracy of those defendants, that is the only
</p>
<p>way in which your attention can legitimately be
</p>
<p>given to any of those meetings at all. Now let me
</p>
<p>deal with this conversation between Captain Des-
</p>
<p>pard and this man on the ditch. If that conversa-
</p>
<p>tion could he taken as evidence, that, in point of
</p>
<p>fact, 2,000 men, 2,000 able-bodied men, of bone and
</p>
<p>sinew as that fellow expresced it, had marched from
</p>
<p>the county of We,\ford to the county of Meatl:, to
</p>
<p>aid at the physical exhibition intended to be made
</p>
<p>at that meeting  if such were the intent, if such a
</p>
<p>conversation could be taken as evidence of tliat,
</p>
<p>and if you, from that conversation, believed that
</p>
<p>that was the fact, then, gentlemen, that conversation
</p>
<p>may be worthy of your attention. But do you be-
</p>
<p>lieve, first of all, that two thousand able-bodied men
</p>
<p>did march from the county of Wexford, from the
</p>
<p>barony of Shilmalier ? Do you believe that ? Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, is that a fact susceptible of any proof? Are
</p>
<p>yoii to fancy to yourselves that it is the fact ? Did
</p>
<p>these men go in a balloon there, and, if they did,
</p>
<p>did they soar to such a height that they could not
</p>
<p>be seen from this earth ? Did they go under ground
</p>
<p>there? What road did they go?  what roads did
</p>
<p>they go ? Where is the human being that saw any
</p>
<p>of them in their transit ? Where were their witnesses
</p>
<p>to show that any of the peasant dresses of the county
</p>
<p>of Wexford, as peculiar as any in Ireland, were to
</p>
<p>be seen there? I take it for granted, gentlemen,

<p>that some of you have been in the county Wexford,

<p>and saw the peasant's hat in Wexford.  the straw

<p>you that he .saw one single Wexford man at it?
</p>
<p>Captain Despard did not  who did? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>my profession may give me, perhaps, too severe a
</p>
<p>view of witnesses. Captain Despard is a very hand-
</p>
<p>some looking fellow  lie has fine whiskers, and is a
</p>
<p>flippant, clever, very ready witness. He went with-
</p>
<p>out whip cr spur, and he came here to tell us, I
</p>
<p>think not a very probable story. I own, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>that even if I were known, as I hope I am, to a jury
</p>
<p>of my fellow-citizens, and if I had to be produced as
</p>
<p>a witness to prove that conversation, I confess I
</p>
<p>would be very anxious indeed to have it corrobo-
</p>
<p>rated, there is so much native improbability in the
</p>
<p>thing. This Wexford man, I am sure, knew Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Dcspardi-nay, the captain himself knew him.
</p>
<p>He must indeed be ripe for rebellion, if he thus
</p>
<p>volunteered to state to the head of the police that he
</p>
<p>had come with a body of " bone-and-sincw" men to
</p>
<p>that meeting ; above all, that he should be guilty of
</p>
<p>the outrageous folly of stating that Mr. O'Conuell did
</p>
<p>not want such men as Captain Despard, but " bone-
</p>
<p>and-sinew" men  a plain insinuation that he wanted
</p>
<p>men to fight, not men to petition  is tiie very acme
</p>
<p>of improbability. Do you think that that was the
</p>
<p>real object of that meeting? And if a man of this
</p>
<p>description knew that it was, and partook in that
</p>
<p>guilt, do you think it a very likely thing that he
</p>
<p>would thus become apparent, and turn himself as it
</p>
<p>were inside out, in the presence of a number of wit-
</p>
<p>nesses, and in a public place ? Why, he must ex-

<p>you to believe that there was some contrivance and |

<p>its detail, but which forms part of that arrangement |
</p>
<p>that brought this Wexford man into communication

<p>with Captain Despard. This transition naturally
</p>
<p>arises out of my observation on the Attorney-Gene-

<p>attention to the monstrous, the atrocious proposi-

<p>tion, of admitting here as evidence of criminality
</p>
<p>against my client conversations lield amongst the
</p>
<p>peasantry on the bridge of Baltinglass. But ho gave
</p>
<p>you the proposition not merely^ as his own, but

<p>he comes witli authority to back it up, to sustain
</p>
<p>them, thougli never was there a proposition sought

<p>to be applied of such monstrous absurdity as that

<p>Mr. Attorney does not take the responsibility of it

<p>He says, in effect, to you, gentlemen, I give it to you

<p>as I find it. 1 have only used a pair of scissors to cut

<p>men, a charge of conspiracj'  and then, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, he tells them, and I beg to call your particular
</p>
<p>attention to it : " It is not necessary to prove that
</p>
<p>those two parties came together, or agreed in terms
</p>
<p>to have the common design, because in many cases
</p>
<p>of clearly established conspiracy there may be no
</p>
<p>means of proving any such thing, and neither law or
</p>
<p>common sense requires it should be proved, if you
</p>
<p>believe the two persons pursued by their acts the
</p>
<p>same object, after the same means, one performing
</p>
<p>one part of the act, and the other another part of the
</p>
<p>same act, with a view to the attainment of the same
</p>
<p>object they were pursuing. You will be at liberty
</p>
<p>to draw the conclusion that they had been engaged
</p>
<p>in a conspiracy toefiect that object." Now, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, while I profess my utter inability to regard the
</p>
<p>proposition propounded by the Attorney-General in
</p>
<p>any other light than as an illegal and monstrous ab-
</p>
<p>surdity, I entirely concur in the language of Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Coleridge that I have read to you, taking it
</p>
<p>of course in common with the facts to which it was
</p>
<p>applied,' witli the case in which it was spoken, with
</p>
<p>the evidence which was offei'od. His wliole words
</p>
<p>must be regarded as consistent with good law and
</p>
<p>common sense ; and all it amounts to is this,
</p>
<p>that men who have conspired  and now I use the

<p>word in its criminal sense, for I'll bring you by-ann-

<p>by to the difference between conspiracy and concert

<p>in regard to men who conspire to commit a crime 
</p>
<p>means in that sense that an understanding existed
</p>
<p>between them previously to do that illegal act, and
</p>
<p>where there are two persons pursuing the same object
</p>
<p>by the same means, itisdemonstratedthat they actin
</p>
<p>concert and conspire for that illegal object. If you

<p>see men agreeing in such a way as that you cannot

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>to have the evidence of some person who actually
</p>
<p>Saw the accused parties in the act of consulting.
</p>
<p>But you must believe that they did actually cousult ;
</p>
<p>and furthermore, that they consulted with a crimi-
</p>
<p>nal intent as criminal conspirators. AH that you
</p>
<p>must believe before you can find a verdict against
</p>
<p>the party or parties who are put on their trial. And
</p>
<p>now, having called your attention to the only two
</p>
<p>authorities that have been cited by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, I come to consider the third point of his
</p>
<p>speech ; and now, gentlemen, as British subjects 
</p>
<p>as men who desire to spend the rest of their lives in a
</p>
<p>country governed by rational laws  as men who desire
</p>
<p>to leave your children the laws as you enjoy them
</p>
<p>yourselves as men who love justice, honour, and in-
</p>
<p>tegrity of purpose, I conjure you to pay attention to
</p>
<p>the remarks which I will ofler upon this branch of
</p>
<p>the case. The Attorney-General told you that
</p>
<p>" provided a man comes into a common purpose or
</p>
<p>design he is as much in it as if he had been in it
</p>
<p>from the beginning !" Such, gentlemen, is the legal

<p>proposition which has been laid down by the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General for your consideration  such the pro-
</p>
<p>position which you are called upon to ratify and
</p>
<p>adopt. He wants to prove that the repeal associa-
</p>
<p>tion is a criminal conspiracy  that every man who
</p>
<p>belongs to it is a criminal conspirator, and he gives
</p>
<p>his law a wide range, for by adopting such a mon-
</p>
<p>strous proposition as this, he gravely tells you that
</p>
<p>every man who comes into a common purpose or

<p>design  to wit, the common purpose or design of

<p>procuring the repeal of an act of parliament  is

<p>guilty of seditious practices, and must be branded

<p>as a member of a wicked and illegal conspiracy. I
</p>
<p>dare say the Solicitor-General, who will have the
</p>
<p>right of reply, will endeavour to get the Attorney-
</p>
<p>GenenJ out of the absurdity in which he is thus in-
</p>
<p>volved by explaining that what the Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ralmeant to convey was, that every one who came into
</p>
<p>a common purpose or design to procure the repeal
</p>
<p>of an act of parliament, by illegal or seditious means,
</p>
<p>was to he accounted a conspirator as much as if he
</p>
<p>had been in the design from the commencement.
</p>
<p>But this explanation necessarily involves the as-
</p>
<p>Bumption that seeking the repeal of a statute, by call-
</p>
<p>ing together in peaceful assembly masses of people,
</p>
<p>who conduct themselves legally and decorously, and
</p>
<p>by the delivering of such speeches as have been read
</p>
<p>in court, involved illegal practices, and was, in point
</p>
<p>of fact, looking for repeal through criminalagencies.
</p>
<p>Let them prove that. The Attorney-General has
</p>
<p>alluded to tlie words of Mr. Justice Bailey, in the
</p>
<p>case of the King v. Watson, and I, too, will take the
</p>
<p>liberty of citing some passages from the same autlio-
</p>
<p>rity in the same case. Hear what .Tustico Bailey
</p>
<p>says on the subject  " Treason differs from felony
</p>
<p>in this, that in cases of felony there are accessaries ;
</p>
<p>in treason there are none ; what would make an ac-
</p>
<p>cessary in felony would be a principal in treason 
</p>
<p>he who plans the thing." Now, I ask, what thing
</p>
<p>was it? The thing of meeting to petition parliament
</p>
<p>for a repeal of the union, was it? No such thing.
</p>
<p>Was it the thing of meeting and making speeches ?
</p>
<p>nothing spoken was high treason. Justice Bailey
</p>
<p>continues and says  " He who plans the thing, de-
</p>
<p>vises the means by which it is to be effected." What
</p>
<p>was to be effected? why the death of the king, or
</p>
<p>the levying of war against the king, or who does any

</p>
<p>2S&
</p>
<p>alleged that the meeting was illegal, and called to-
</p>
<p>gether in consequence of a criminal conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>that in consequence of Uedford having attended this
</p>
<p>illegal meeting the defendant in the discharge of liis
</p>
<p>duty put him away with as little injury as possible.
</p>
<p>In this plea a conspiracy was alluded to, and it then
</p>
<p>became necessary to prove it. In consequence of
</p>
<p>this, amongst other evidence produced on the trial,
</p>
<p>was a man who stated that two or three nights be-
</p>
<p>fore the meeting, at a place called the White Moss,
</p>
<p>he saw a great body of men going through exercise
</p>
<p>or discipline like soldiers. The evidence was ten-
</p>
<p>dered, as it was said the man was ill used and abused
</p>
<p>by the parties who were so assembled, but they let
</p>
<p>him go with his life, and on the next day when
</p>
<p>passing the house of that man, on their way to the
</p>
<p>meeting, the parties liissed. That evidence must
</p>
<p>have been given on the trial of Hunt when he was
</p>
<p>charged at York with the conspiracy, and if the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General was right Hunt must have been a
</p>
<p>conspirator although he was not at the night meeting
</p>
<p>where the man was abused, and where the men were
</p>
<p>drilled. This evidence was objected to, but it was
</p>
<p>admitted by the judge, and the jury found a general
</p>
<p>verdict for the defendant, but on which of the pleas
</p>
<p>it did not appear. A motion was made afterwards
</p>
<p>to set aside that verdict, on the ground that illegal
</p>
<p>evidence was allowed to go to the jury, but it was
</p>
<p>refused ; and the Attorney-General says this is the
</p>
<p>dicta of a judge in reference to the present case 
</p>
<p>that it was a dicta to show what was an illegal con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. First of all, those dicta, whatever may be
</p>
<p>their value, were all spoken in reference to the case

<p>before the court, and in reference to the question
</p>
<p>before the court, that question being narrowly and
</p>
<p>simply whether or not the evidence of those drillings
</p>
<p>two nights before the meeting were admissible, to
</p>
<p>show the jury that there was an illegal conspiracy
</p>
<p>in that case. The jury acquitted Mr. Hunt of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy where it was the question they had to
</p>
<p>try the jury found a verdict in this case for the
</p>
<p>defendant which they might have done without there
</p>
<p>being a conspiracy. The question was, were these
</p>
<p>drillings evidence of a conspirac)'  not whether they
</p>
<p>proved a conspiracy, but whether there was such
</p>
<p>proof submitted to the jury that they might come
</p>
<p>to the conclusion whether there was a conspiracy or
</p>
<p>not, and it is from the dicta of judges in that ques-
</p>
<p>tion brought in that way before the court that the
</p>
<p>Attorpey-General has endeavoured to prove that
</p>
<p>there is a conspiracy in the present case, and that
</p>
<p>the meetings in the present case are illegal meet-
</p>
<p>ings; and, gentlemen, from that case he cited for
</p>
<p>you a part of the dictum of a very learned judge,
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Best, now Lord Wynford. He cited
</p>
<p>those words for you, and those only, that the drilling
</p>
<p>was not innocent  that it was not necessary to de-
</p>
<p>cide that immediate mischief was to be done, he cites
</p>
<p>that from page 125. Gentlemen, in estimating the
</p>
<p>value of the dicta of judges, when cited by a lawyer
</p>
<p>in cases in which they have a great interest, I hope
</p>
<p>you will bear in mind this dictum as it has been
</p>
<p>cited. This dictum was cited for the purpose of
</p>
<p>leading you to the conclusion that the drillings that
</p>
<p>were alleged to have taken place amongst the re-
</p>
<p>pealers, but that have not been proved, were criminal
</p>
<p>and illegal drillings ; and Mr. Attorney-General

<p>say to him strike fairly, but if you aim below the
</p>
<p>belt, I repeat it, although you succeed in parrying
</p>
<p>your treacherous blow, you are no longer a man
</p>
<p>entitled to any respect, or entitled to any quarter.
</p>
<p>Am I, gentlemen, because I am not here in my
</p>
<p>own case, am I not to iight this battle as I would
</p>
<p>fight for myself? Gentlemen, it may he produc-
</p>
<p>tive of bad consequences to me in my career to
</p>
<p>do so  but I shall never eat the guilty bread
</p>
<p>which is earned by professional subserviency. I
</p>
<p>shall not retire to rest upon my pillow borne down
</p>
<p>with the remorseful feeling that I was an example
</p>
<p>of turpitude, as I should if I would not say over and
</p>
<p>over again every word that I am justified in saying,
</p>
<p>and in saying because I am justified in feeling it.
</p>
<p>Such, gentlemen, has been the conduct of the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General in this prosecution as to the law ; and
</p>
<p>then after stating the law, he comes to the facts of
</p>
<p>this " momentous" case. Yes, I agree with him 
</p>
<p>it is a " momentous" case  but, no doubt, I don't
</p>
<p>agree with him in his reasons for calling it so. That
</p>
<p>he thinks it a " momentous" case I have no doubt,
</p>
<p>but that feeling has reference to the eflfects.it must
</p>
<p>have upon his own position with his own party. No
</p>
<p>doubt it is a " momentous" case to him, and because
</p>
<p>he thus feels it, this prosecution has been carried on
</p>
<p>as such things ever are when the party concerned is
</p>
<p>not the prosecutor for the crown, but on account of
</p>
<p>himself. It is evident that he is influenced by the
</p>
<p>consideration of the position in which he may be
</p>
<p>placed with his party, and, therefore, gentlemen,

</p>
<p>your verdict of " guilty or not guilty" may produce
</p>
<p>peace and quietness in the country ? As to that I
</p>
<p>deny the right of any portion of the community, be-
</p>
<p>cause it may be useful to themselves, to take one
</p>
<p>farthing out of my pocket, to touch one hair of my
</p>
<p>head, or deprive me of one moment's liberty, because
</p>
<p>it may do them good. Does not common justice
</p>
<p>revolt at the notion ? If he means that it is a " mo-
</p>
<p>mentous case" because your verdict of "guilty or not
</p>
<p>guilty" may be serviceable to the community, I deny
</p>
<p>it. I deny your right, supposing that you represent
</p>
<p>the opinions of ninety-nine out of every hundred of the
</p>
<p>people, to entertain one thought of the effect of your
</p>
<p>verdict upon them. Gentlemen of the jury, when a
</p>
<p>man is fairly convicted  when a jury pronounce him
</p>
<p>to be a cruninal  then arises the question how he is to
</p>
<p>be dealt with as to his punishment, having reference
</p>
<p>to the good of the country. But while I stand here,
</p>
<p>until I am found guilty, I deny the right of any
</p>
<p>human being to plead his own good as an excuse for
</p>
<p>my conviction. Yet that is the reason that it has
</p>
<p>been said to you that this is a momentous case.

<p>Let me now give you mine. Gentlemen, you

<p>cannot be ignorant cf the history of your own
</p>
<p>country, and of every other country in Europe 
</p>
<p>you cannot be ignorant of the change which took

<p>place in human affairs when the Roman empire

<p>withdrew its forces from her distant dominions, and
</p>
<p>when the northern hordes poured down upon the

<p>centre of Europe, and established themselves in

<p>power. A very slight knowledge is enough to in-

<p>vhin the ' affaii-s of France presented a spectacle

<p>which every lover of peace and order, every man
</p>
<p>who had the peace and happiness of mankind at
</p>
<p>heart, would join with all possible alacrity in avert-

<p>ing in his own country. That was a time at which

<p>one of the ablest, one of the most learned, one of

<p>the cunuingest, one of the most artful men that
</p>
<p>ever lived, was made in England Attorney-General.

<p>a great man  a very popular man  a very great man.
</p>
<p>In point of bearing and ability few could equal Home
</p>
<p>Tooke. They assembled a jury upon that occasion ;
</p>
<p>they got hold of the papers of the two societies of which
</p>
<p>Home Tooke was a member  they, as in this case,
</p>
<p>raised a chaos on the table  they threw down horse-
</p>
<p>loads of these papers, and desired the jury, and inge-
</p>
<p>niously sought to induce them to pick out treason from

<p>the mass. That prosecution was countenanced by the

<p>greatest authority  it was carried on  it was pressed

<p>on with the ability that both the Attorney-General

<p>and Solicitor-General of that day possessed, for I am

<p>willing to acknowledge that they were both great

<p>men. That prosecution, however, failed ; the common

</p>
<p>ESTKAORDINARY SCENE  THE ATTORNEY-
</p>
<p>GENERAL.
</p>
<p> [During the absence of the judges and jury for
</p>
<p>refreshments, a scene of the most singular and un-
</p>
<p>precedented character took place in court, whicli
</p>
<p>perhaps it ever fell to the lot of any man, versant
</p>
<p>with legal proceedings, to record. It was observed
</p>
<p>that some hasty observations, and that in a very
</p>
<p>excited tone and manner, passed between Mr. Fitz-
</p>
<p>gibbon and the Attorney-General ; and there was,
</p>
<p>to use the language of Mr. Shell, " a hush of public
</p>
<p>expectancy and almost breathless silence;" when,
</p>
<p>after a much more protracted absence than usual,
</p>
<p>their lordships resumed their seats upon the bench.
</p>
<p>. Mr. Fitzgibbon rose and said  My lords, as I was
</p>
<p>coming into com-t, after having, from the effects of
</p>
<p>illness, endeavoured to take a little rest in the li-
</p>
<p>brary, borne down by an exertion not very season-
</p>
<p>able, having regard to the state of my health, a note
</p>
<p>was put into my hand, signed by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, which I ask him now to place in your
</p>
<p>lordships' hands.
</p>
<p>A short pause ensued, and the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>having made no reply,
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon continued  My lords, I hope that
</p>
<p>in opening the case, I did very clearly and very
</p>
<p>plainly express my sense of the position in which I
</p>
<p>had been professionally placed. I think I did very
</p>
<p>clearly and plainly express what my feelings were
</p>
<p>in respect to the gentlemen who here represent the
</p>
<p>crown. I very clearly separated any reference, in
</p>
<p>what I said, of my private feelings from what I con-
</p>
<p>sidered my duty required of me to express, not in
</p>
<p>reference to themselves personally, but to their

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>a case like the present, vhere the feelings of every
</p>
<p>person engaged on the one side or on the other, are
</p>
<p>necessarily very much excited, and in which I should
</p>
<p>hope every indulgence might be extended to any-
</p>
<p>thing irregular that may have occurred  what I was
</p>
<p>going to take the liberty of suggesting was, that as
</p>
<p>there appears to exist a very warm feeling on one
</p>
<p>side and on the other, an opportunity should be af-
</p>
<p>forded of allowing that to subside, and of removing
</p>
<p>on both sides any misconception that may have
</p>
<p>previously existed. That was the proposition I was
</p>
<p>going to take the liberty of making. I cannot at-
</p>
<p>tempt to justify what has taken place, nor am I
</p>
<p>authorised to interfere in it ; but from the position
</p>
<p>which I have the honour to hold, and the sincere
</p>
<p>personal regard I entertain for both gentlemen, and
</p>
<p>thinking it might be desirable for their own sakes,
</p>
<p>for the interests of the profession, and the sake of
</p>
<p>the public at large, if the court would allow some
</p>
<p>interval to elapse, in order that those feelings may
</p>
<p>subside, and this most unpleasant affair may be sa-
</p>
<p>tisfactorily arranged, I have, on tliis account, been
</p>
<p>induced to offer my suggestion.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The court are very much indebted,
</p>
<p>and very much obliged to you, Mr. Moore, for the
</p>
<p>part you have taken, and th^ short explanation you
</p>
<p>have given. The court feel themselves placed in a
</p>
<p>very embarrassing and perplexing situation. They
</p>
<p>feel unwilling to give any intimation of their opinion
</p>
<p>as to the propriety or impropriety of what has
</p>
<p>taken place in court, being willing to make allow-
</p>
<p>ance for the excited feelings of the gentlemen con-
</p>

<p>them beyond what their cool judgment would ap-
</p>
<p>prove of. They, therefore, give no sort of intima-
</p>
<p>tion at present of what their opinion is in regard to
</p>
<p>the conduct of the gentlemen at either side pending
</p>
<p>the trial of this case. They feel it to be very em-
</p>
<p>barrassing to be required to pronounce any sort of
</p>
<p>opinion while a case of this nature, in which the
</p>
<p>public is so much interested, is depending before the
</p>
<p>court, the jury, and the public at large ; and they
</p>
<p>also feel that of all men in the profession the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General is the last man who ought to have
</p>
<p>allowed himself to be betrayed into such an expres-
</p>
<p>sion of feeling as has been stated to the court as
</p>
<p>having taken place in the very presence of the
</p>
<p>court ; for although it took place during our tem-
</p>
<p>porary withdrawal, and we were not personally
</p>
<p>present, it yet occurred while the court. was sitting
</p>
<p>in the discharge of its judicial functions.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General (interrupting the court) 
</p>
<p>I have to state, and my friends tell me so, that that
</p>
<p>note was written very hastily ; but considering the
</p>
<p>position I was placed in, and the strongly irritated
</p>
<p>feeling I was under, I concur in what has been sug-
</p>
<p>gested to me, and I have no objection to withdraw
</p>
<p>that letter, but I shall make no-further terms about
</p>
<p>it. I feel that I was very hardly dealt with, and I
</p>
<p>leave it to the court to consider what course the
</p>
<p>gentleman who used that language ought to adopt in
</p>
<p>regard to what is due to me.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice The court are bound to consi-
</p>
<p>der what took place as if it occurred during the
</p>
<p>business of the court, and we can't by any possibi-
</p>
<p>lity allow it to go further. Itmustbeputa stop to.
</p>
<p>Mr, Moore  I know how very difficult a position

<p>I am, placed in ; but I would take the liberty of sug-

<p>MR. PITZGIBBON'S ARGUMENT FOR THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>303
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The Attorney-General has with-
</p>
<p>drawn the note he addressed to you, Mr. Fitzgib-
</p>
<p>bon. He has expressed his regret that it was writ-
</p>
<p>ten, and wishes it to be regarded as if it had never
</p>
<p>been written. He misunderstood you.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibhon  My lords, any man must have
</p>
<p>grossly misunderstood me who imputes to me the
</p>
<p>intention of attributing base motives to any one in
</p>
<p>the discharge of my professional duty. If I could
</p>
<p>for a moment imagine that any man could con-
</p>
<p>seiention'sly suppose me capable of such gross con-
</p>
<p>duct as that of imputing to the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>base motives  I have nothing on earth to say to
</p>
<p>his motives  I can only say that such a man has
</p>
<p>grossly misinterpreted me. Were 1, indeed, capable
</p>
<p>of acting such a part, I could never again esteem or
</p>
<p>respect myself, and the direst punishment that could
</p>
<p>befal me would be the self-reproach which would
</p>
<p>follow me in every scene of my life. I only spoke
</p>
<p>of the Attorney-General in his official character as
</p>
<p>t le law officer of the crowTi, and my remarks had
</p>
<p>only reference, I again repeat, to his conduct in the
</p>
<p>present case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore rose and said that the gentlemen at
</p>
<p>both sides having given every explanation that could
</p>
<p>be expected from them, of whatever was disagree-
</p>
<p>able in this distressing occurrence, he hoped that the
</p>
<p>matter might now be fairly considered as set at rest.
</p>
<p>He trusted that it would be passed over in silence,
</p>
<p>and consigned to oblivion for ever.
</p>
<p>The Chief J ustice (after consulting with his bre-
</p>
<p>thren) said that the court felt exceedingly obliged
</p>
<p>to Mr. Moore for the part he had taken on this per-

</p>
<p>plexing and distressing occasion. The matter was
</p>
<p>now at rest, and the court most earnestly trusted
</p>
<p>that it would not be necessary hereafter to advert in
</p>
<p>any manner whatsoever to what had taken place. I
</p>
<p>Bhonld hope it is not necessary to say any more on
</p>
<p>the matter than has been already stated.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  I of course acquiesce in
</p>
<p>every thing that has fallen from the court. I have
</p>
<p>withdrawn the note, and, inasmuch as I understood
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon to repudiate the idea of imputing
</p>
<p>any unworthy or personal motives to me, I can only
</p>
<p>say I am satisfied.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  That this unpleasant matter may
</p>
<p>at once be set at rest, the court think that they may
</p>
<p>call upon each gentleman to declare that he is satis-
</p>
<p>fled to abide by what has just fallen from Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I can only say that 1 did not
</p>
<p>mean to attribute any unworthy motive to the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, and I have no other feeling towards
</p>
<p>him at the present moment differing from what I
</p>
<p>felt this morning.
</p>
<p>Thus the matter dropped.]
</p>
<p>The Learned Counsel then resumed his address to
</p>
<p>the jury. He said  I hope, gentlemen, that you
</p>
<p>will not misinterpret any observations wliich in the
</p>
<p>course of this trial I may deem it my duty to address
</p>
<p>to you in reference to the conduct of those who have
</p>
<p>conducted this prosecution on the part of the crown,
</p>
<p>and I trust you will invariably kee]) it in mind that
</p>
<p>however strong may be my animadversions on the
</p>
<p>course pursued by any of the law officers, it is not
</p>
<p>my attention to attribute impure motives in any
</p>
<p>quarter, for I have nothing to do with the motives
</p>
<p>of any man in this case. I have only to analyse their
</p>
<p>official acts, and their official acts 1 will analyse, for

</p>
<p>and designated O'Connell's agitation for the repeal
</p>
<p>of the union as iasurrectionary and rebellious. Did
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General prove to you that Lord Althorp
</p>
<p>erer made such a speeclv at all ? He was bound to
</p>
<p>do that as he made the assertion in liis opening
</p>
<p>statement to you. Did the Attorney-General even
</p>
<p>make an attempt to do so ? No, lie did not. Tlien
</p>
<p>why open such a case to you at all ? He also told
</p>
<p>you that in the year 1831 Lord Jolm Russell also
</p>
<p>made a speecli in the house of commons, and that
</p>
<p>he said the repeal of the union would be a dismem-
</p>
<p>berment of the empire  that it would be disastrous
</p>
<p>to monarchy, and would be the means of establish-
</p>
<p>ing a ferocious republicanism. I asli you is that the
</p>
<p>way to deal justly with this case  is it the way to
</p>
<p>deal with a man on trial  and, I ask, is there any
</p>
<p>justification of such conduct on the part of the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General ? Is it just, is it legal for the Attoi'-
</p>
<p>ney-General to put such things into his opening
</p>
<p>statement, and sit down without offering you one
</p>
<p>single particle of evidence on the subject ? He tells
</p>
<p>you the objects of the defendants was branded by
</p>
<p>Lord John Russell in 1834, and that the repeal agi-
</p>
<p>tation was tending towards criminality, that it
</p>
<p>would be a dismemberment of the empire, and the
</p>
<p>establisWng of a ferocious system of republicanism.
</p>
<p>He told you also that Lord Ebrington, the Lord
</p>
<p>Lieutenant of Ireland, had said that he had a great
</p>
<p>horror of civil war, but that he would risk a civil
</p>
<p>war before he would accede to a repeal of the union.
</p>
<p>I ask was this fair, loyal, or just in the Attornej'-
</p>
<p>General? AVas it a fair act on his part to read for
</p>
<p>you the statement of Lord Ebrington, the state-

<p>ments of Lord Althorp and Lord John Russell,
</p>
<p>without giving any evidence of these things, or
</p>
<p>without being able to prove the facts? What legal
</p>
<p>right had he to do so ? None whatever  and I here
</p>
<p>boldly assert he had not the least right to do so. Let
</p>
<p>me bring back your minds to one portion of the
</p>
<p>statement made by the Attorney-General in his de-
</p>
<p>scription of conspiracy ; he stated that it was a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to combine to effect lawful means by un-
</p>
<p>lawful purposes. I ask you here, and I ask you
</p>
<p>confidently, is it legal for the Attorney-General to
</p>
<p>seek to throw illegal evidence into your box by
</p>
<p>reading documents of which he could not give a
</p>
<p>particle of evidence ? Was it not arriving at a legal
</p>
<p>conclusion by illegal means on the part of the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General ? AVill any one of his colleagues tell
</p>
<p>you he was entitled to read the speeches of Spring
</p>
<p>Rice and the other persons alluded to, and sit down
</p>
<p>without ever attempting to offer any evidence to
</p>
<p>prove them. I say his official conduct in that was
</p>
<p>most illegal, and was done to obtain an end in the
</p>
<p>minds of the jury. If ever there was a case that
</p>
<p>ought to be confined within the strict limit of the
</p>
<p>law, and solely to the proofs, it is the present case,
</p>
<p>where a fellow-subject is under trial, and where the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General stands up to prosecute, he is
</p>
<p>bound by all ties to confine himself to strict legal
</p>
<p>rules ; but the instances I have given are not the
</p>
<p>only instances I can give you of a departure from
</p>
<p>legal rules by the Attorney-General. Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>speak to you about the proneness to indulge in tliis
</p>
<p>departure from legal rules. I can give you several,
</p>
<p>and I will now show you how necessary it is to con-
</p>
<p>fine crown prosecutors to the strict letter of the law.
</p>
<p>You all remember a man named Jolmston, who was

</p>
<p>herer struck him to.recollect "The Exile, of Erin."
</p>
<p>Now, what is-that little piece of poetry ? What is
</p>
<p>it but an expression of pity, and commiseratioii, and
</p>
<p>respect towards those who .perished in that frantic
</p>
<p>struggle, telling those who may be the relatives of
</p>
<p>the unfortunate persons that so perished that there
</p>
<p>was no reason to blush for their treating them as
</p>
<p>jwor misguided men, no doubt concluding with the
</p>
<p>chorus  .   '
</p>
<p>" You, men, will be true men^ and remember '98."
</p>
<p>1 don't know -whether it w'^s expected by the repe-
</p>
<p>tition of those lines, gentlemen; that you, men,
</p>
<p>should be true men, and that you should remember
</p>
<p>'98; And that you should remember '98 against
</p>
<p>those of the traversers that stoo(J the test of '98 
</p>
<p>that were. loyal in '98  that we're loyal since '98 
</p>
<p>and that you should be true men and remember
</p>
<p>'98 against those that were not born in '98. I own,
</p>
<p>to my imagination, that little document when read
</p>
<p>brought that.ideayery strongly, and it made me ap-
</p>
<p>prehend that it was at least expected tjiat your ver-
</p>
<p>dict could be influenced a-gainst those gentlemen by
</p>
<p>inflaming your passions by a recollection of that un-.
</p>
<p>fortunate period'. But now, gentlemen, as a general

</p>
<p>what do the.y 'really amount to? The past has been

<p>referred to by many members of this association,

<p>and referred'to in terms which they would have you

<p>to suppose was intended to excite a spirit and feel-
</p>
<p>ing of revenge in the' living. That that has been
</p>
<p>done  that the pait has been referred to in terms

<p>. or by conspirators; or by men engaged in an atro-
</p>
<p>cious and concealed attempt to stimulate the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants of the present day to civil war. That they did
</p>
<p>use this language, plain and unvarnished, as they
</p>
<p>did, to my niind carries much conviction that they
</p>
<p>. had no criminal intent whatever. That they acted
</p>
<p>openly, and plainly, and unreservedly. Now, let us
</p>
<p>for a minute contemplate the means by which this
</p>
<p>repeal of the union was to be carried. Before we
</p>
<p>come to details it is but right to have regard to the
</p>
<p>period, to the time, and to the circumsta-hces, under
</p>
<p>which this agitation has been got up. In modern
</p>
<p>days public opinion' has attained strength wholly
</p>
<p>unknown to it in ancient times. IVliy, what is the
</p>
<p>cause of it ? The cause of it is this  the rapid com-
</p>
<p>munication between the several countiues on the
</p>
<p>face of the earths the rapid communication of
</p>
<p>thought  so thai the whole human race has been,
</p>
<p>as it were, a single country  nay, a single family  ;
</p>
<p>in which no individual can stir in any public matter
</p>
<p>without being under the view and under the opinion
</p>
<p>of all. . He must be but a poor observer of human
</p>
<p>events that will not perceive how vast those very en-
</p>
<p>gines are I speak of  this rapid communication and
</p>
<p>this power of the press  two perfectly modern en-
</p>
<p>gines ; they are proceeding to put out of the world
</p>
<p>altogether, and I hope they will, the use of brute
</p>
<p>physical force. War is becoming daily less likely
</p>
<p>to occur, and why ? because the conduct, of a nation
</p>
<p>becomes as it were the conduct of an individual, and
</p>
<p>it is brought under view for the condemnation or the
</p>
<p>praise of all other nations. And hence it is that
</p>
<p>physical war is ultimately likely to give place al-
</p>
<p>together to the force of a much stronger engine,
</p>
<p>namely, the public opinion of the human race. Be-

<p>legally, and, if yoii please, he is pursuing an illegal
</p>
<p>object, is he, therefore, a conspirator? See how
</p>
<p>that is illustrated by the cases that are decided
</p>
<p>upon. Those who bribed the assistant of the card-
</p>
<p>maker were guilty of the crime charged to them. Is
</p>
<p>that like the case now brought before you ? Cer-
</p>
<p>tainly not. It is utterly impossible. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the law of this country never sanctioned the appli-
</p>
<p>cation of the law of conspiracy in any such case as
</p>
<p>this. In the case of the King v. Burke, reported in
</p>
<p>the 25th volume of the State Trials, the traversers
</p>
<p>were accused o conspiring to excite insurrection in
</p>
<p>this country, and to bring in foreign forces here ;
</p>
<p>and, strange to say, although it is quite plain that
</p>
<p>Buch a conspiracy as that would be treason, yet
</p>
<p>they were not indicted for that but for misdemea-
</p>
<p>nour. In that case the witnesses were produced,
</p>
<p>who alleged that they themselves aided the three
</p>
<p>others who were on trial ; the case broke down,
</p>
<p>and there was an acquittal. Having failed in that
</p>
<p>prosecution, after that the case was commenced
</p>
<p>against Hardy and Tooke, and having failed in that
</p>
<p>case, as 1 told you before, to establish constructive
</p>
<p>treason, the government turned their attention to a
</p>
<p>person named Yorke, commonly called Redhead.
</p>
<p>His case is reported in the same voltune, and they
</p>
<p>prosecuted him for a conspiracy and misdemeanour,
</p>
<p>a conspiracy for being a member of the societies, a
</p>
<p>connection with which they had sought to establish
</p>
<p>against Hardy and Tooke. Yorke was convicted.
</p>

</p>
<p>had whoUy faUed and broke down. That case of
</p>
<p>Yorke, so far as I can learn, never entered into pre-
</p>
<p>cedent, and I do not think any lawyer reading the
</p>
<p>report can say it was a constitutional or proper pro-
</p>
<p>secution. Yorke was convicted and sentenced to
</p>
<p>two years' imprisonment, and here the case rested.
</p>
<p>At that time when the government of that day insti-
</p>
<p>tuted this prosecution against Yorke, they had not
</p>
<p>only failed in their attempt to establish a case of con-
</p>
<p>structive treason ; but they also failed in the at-
</p>
<p>tempt  the persevering attempt  to establish a mis-
</p>
<p>demeanour, which would have answered their pur-
</p>
<p>pose. The law of libel from the time Lord Mans-
</p>
<p>field first came to the bench, in 1756, was a source
</p>
<p>of great controversy between the people and the go-
</p>
<p>vernment. The doctrine propounded by the state
</p>
<p>lawyers, and finally adopted by the bench, was that
</p>
<p>the mere fact of publication constituted the guilt of
</p>
<p>the party indicted, and that the jury had notliing
</p>
<p>to do with anything else except the bare fact of pub-
</p>
<p>lication to find a verdict where a person was accused
</p>
<p>of having published a Ubel on the government, and
</p>
<p>Lord Mansfield appears to have decided that as the
</p>
<p>law in the case of the King v. , noticed after-
</p>
<p>wards by himself in the third volume of the Term
</p>
<p>Reports ; but it came more directly before him in the
</p>
<p>case of Woodfall. He was prosecuted for publishing
</p>
<p>Junius's letters, which contained remarkable and
</p>
<p>pointed allusions to physical force in plain terms,
</p>
<p>and threatened not only the king's ministers with
</p>
<p>it, but tlie king himself. AVoodfali was prosecuted,
</p>
<p>and Lord Mansfield told the jury they had nothing
</p>
<p>to do with any question except that of mere publi-
</p>
<p>cation, and they found a verdict accordingly. They
</p>
<p>found that he was " guilty of the printing and pub-

<p>accident it might so happen that twelve anti-repeal-
</p>
<p>ers might get into the jury-box, and the crown knew
</p>
<p>that it would be a very convenient dilemma to bring
</p>
<p>those twelve gentlemen into, either to acquit the
</p>
<p>traversers or else to find a verdict of guilty on the
</p>
<p>conspiracy count, there being no other count in the
</p>
<p>indictment upon which they could be found guilty.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this is a case which it behoves you to
</p>
<p>approach with minds calm, unprejudiced, and dis-
</p>
<p>passionate. Great is the trust that has been re-
</p>
<p>posed in you  momentous, indeed, is the task which
</p>
<p>has devolved upon you. I tell you, gentlemen, you
</p>
<p>are here acting as the guardians of that constitution
</p>
<p>which you have received from your forefathers as
</p>
<p>your noblest inheritance  you are here acting as
</p>
<p>guardians of that law, by which rational liberty is
</p>
<p>either now to be secured or must leave your country
</p>
<p>for ever  ^you are here in the citadel of liberty.  do
</p>
<p>not suflFer yourselves to be deluded into the suppo-
</p>
<p>sition that it is the traversers alone who are interested
</p>
<p>in the result of your verdict. You are each of you
</p>
<p>interested in this case, for the fortunes of your coun-
</p>
<p>try are involved. Do not for a moment suppose that
</p>
<p>I fear that any one gentleman of the twelve whom
</p>
<p>I am addressing is not as upright a man as any that
</p>
<p>can be found in society, or that he would not dis-
</p>
<p>charge his duty in this case with firmness of purpose
</p>
<p>and unswerving determination. The Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral read for you in the course of his address a very
</p>
<p>impressive passage from a charge of the late Lord
</p>
<p>Chief Justice, delivered at a special commission in
</p>
<p>Maryborough, but you must bear in mind the occa-
</p>

<p>remember that it was a strong exhortation to the
</p>
<p>grand jury under very peculiar circumstances. In
</p>
<p>the commencement of his charge the late Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice drew the attention of the grand jury to the
</p>
<p>vast number of murders and atrocious incendiary
</p>
<p>offences which had taken place in the Queen's
</p>
<p>County during the brief space of two months, and
</p>
<p>he deemed it expedient to exhort the jurors upon the
</p>
<p>necessity of performing their duty with firmness
</p>
<p>and decision, for he knew he was addressing a body
</p>
<p>of men who lived in the midst of those desperate
</p>
<p>andsreckless characters by whom the dreadful deeds
</p>
<p>had been committed wliich created the necessity for
</p>
<p>the special commission. Under these circimistances
</p>
<p>it was proper and just for that able and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional judge to tell the grand jury, in emphatic lan-
</p>
<p>guage, that those associated crimes must be met
</p>
<p>vigorously by the strong arm of the law ; but, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, you must not lose sight of this fact, that the
</p>
<p>language quoted by the Attorney-General was not
</p>
<p>addressed to a jury sworn to try whether any ac-
</p>
<p>cused parties were or were not guilty of the crime
</p>
<p>imputed to their charge. That language was used
</p>
<p>before any man was viewed as a criminal  before
</p>
<p>any man was placed upon his trial in view of the
</p>
<p>court, and when the only duty of the jury was to
</p>
<p>decide, not whether A. B. was or was not guilty, but
</p>
<p>whether the bill of indictment against him ought to
</p>
<p>be received as a true bill or ignored. If that ever-
</p>
<p>to-be-remembered judge had used such language in
</p>
<p>addressing a petty jury before whom a prisoner had
</p>
<p>been arraigned, it would have been an eternal blot
</p>
<p>on his memory as a judge of the land. It would
</p>
<p>te a blot on his memory to have done so. What,
</p>
<p>may I ask, would be the feelings of that Chief

<p>Chief Justice.  We cannot hear you now, sir, ad-

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the magnitude of this case, and its
</p>
<p>importance to the client who has placed me here
</p>
<p>to defend him, absolutely requires that I should
</p>
<p>stand up on the morning of the second day to ad-
</p>
<p>dress you. I hope no man will object that to me,
</p>
<p>that I should not have the power, in a speech of
</p>
<p>some two, or three, or four, or five, or sis, or seven
</p>
<p>hours, to digest a mass of matter that lias been con-
</p>
<p>fusedly laid down before you without explanation 
</p>
<p>that I should not have tlie faculty in a short speech
</p>
<p>to bring before you the other matters calculated to
</p>
<p>explain, and neutralize, and render innocent much
</p>
<p>of what you have heard in the shape of cruninatiou.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that is not my fault  it may be my mis-
</p>
<p>fortune. I may, perhaps, be entirely deficient in
</p>
<p>the faculty of condensation. I can deal with a
</p>
<p>case, I confess, only by details. I hope I don't
</p>
<p>stand in a wrong position from being supposed for
</p>
<p>one moment, in not concluding yesterday, to have
</p>
<p>feroken any implied promise to the court.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Don't imagine any such thing.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  I have a duty to perform in re-
</p>
<p>ference to my own peace of mind, and I must do it,
</p>
<p>no matter what time I may take to do it ; I stand
</p>
<p>here only for one of the traversers, technically
</p>
<p>speaking, Dr. Gray. He, gentlemen, is a young
</p>
<p>man, and belongs to a respectable and learned pro-
</p>
<p>fession  as respectable, as useful, and as honourable
</p>
<p>a profession as that to which I have the honour my-
</p>
<p>self to belong. He is part proprietor of a newspaper
</p>
<p>of, perhaps, the oldest standing of any in your city
</p>
<p>,  a newspaper tliat has preserved a good and unim-
</p>
<p>peached character for morality, and a high character
</p>
<p>for ability, for half a century in your city. I, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, have to defend him for having been taken

</p>
<p>to be armed, that Ireland was to be by arms coerced ;
</p>
<p>that -was the news that had arrived. That that
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell intended to be a constitutional,
</p>
<p>a legal, and moral movement of the people, without
</p>
<p>the slightest possible anticipation of any sort of dis-
</p>
<p>turbance, or \'iolence or force, that that should be by
</p>
<p>the government, made the ground for commencing
</p>
<p>hostilities, by way of war  that is the news. "If
</p>
<p>(this is another passage) they assail us to-morrow,
</p>
<p>and if we shall conquer them, the first use we should
</p>
<p>make of the victory would be to place the sceptre
</p>
<p>in the hand of our Queen." Kemember the great
</p>
<p>stress that is laid by the Attorney-General on that
</p>
<p>passage. Wliat ! said he ; is a subject to talk of plac-
</p>
<p>ing the sceptre in the hands of his Sovereign that
</p>
<p>already has possession of it ? What is the subject to
</p>
<p>mean by that except he is first by force, and war,
</p>
<p>and rebellion, and insurrection, to take that sceptre
</p>
<p>from that Sovereign ? How else could he talk of re-
</p>
<p>storing it to her ? That is his argument, but do you
</p>
<p>believe that Mr. O'Connell ever in the course of his
</p>
<p>long life, gifted as he is with an understanding such
</p>
<p>as belongs to few persons  do you believe that he
</p>
<p>ever was dolt enough, driveller enough, idiot enough
</p>
<p>to imagine that he or any man, against the sense of
</p>
<p>the rational body of British subjects, could wrest the
</p>
<p>sceptre from the hand to whom it belongs by heredi-
</p>
<p>tary, and just, and legal, and constitutional right?
</p>
<p>He never could be absurd enough to fancy in his mind,
</p>
<p>or entertain the most distant notion on earth, that it
</p>
<p>could ever be in his power to have" the bestowing of
</p>
<p>that sceptre on any human being whatever, much
</p>
<p>less the Sovereign to whom it rightly, and properly,

<p>and justly belofags, and belongs not with the assent
</p>
<p>not with the consent  but with the heartfelt ac-
</p>
<p>clamation of every subject in every part of her do-
</p>
<p>minions. He says, " Have we not the ordinary
</p>
<p>courage of the English?" and,[ oh, says the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General, what could they want courage for but
</p>
<p>for the battle ? Is no courage necessary to keep
</p>
<p>your peaceful and moral position, and to persevere
</p>
<p>against every threat of violence by the moral force of
</p>
<p>moral opinion to seek for your rights by exposing the
</p>
<p>injustice you are suffering ? Is no courage necessary
</p>
<p>for that ? If a large body of the Irish population be
</p>
<p>in a state of wretchedness  of misery  and of real
</p>
<p>tribulation, and if they be  and if they would call
</p>
<p>the attention of mankind to their suffering, is no
</p>
<p>moral courage necessary for them to assemble in
</p>
<p>peaceable but in multitudinous bodies, and there
</p>
<p>to expose the sufiering they are enduring ? Is no
</p>
<p>moral courage necessary in the pursuit of that
</p>
<p>lionest and fair exposition  that legal and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional exposition of their sufferings ? Is not moral
</p>
<p>and physical com^age, too, necessary, to carry them
</p>
<p>through that, without the commission of crime, or
</p>
<p>the appearance of any disposition to commit it ? Is
</p>
<p>it fair to Mr. O'Connell to put the foul construction
</p>
<p>that has been put on that expression when he has
</p>
<p>explained what the courage he is speaking of is, not
</p>
<p>in one, or two, or three, but in a series of speeches ?
</p>
<p>He says, "Are we to be called slaves, and trampled
</p>
<p>under foot?" alluding to the news that had come
</p>
<p>to Ireland of the armament that was to be sent into
</p>
<p>Ireland to trample under foot those that met peace-
</p>
<p>ably. " They will never (.he says) trample me at
</p>
<p>least. I was wrong : they may trample me ! but it
</p>
<p>willbemy dead body they shall trample upon, not the

<p>310
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>force would be too strong for physical. He next
</p>
<p>proceeds to say, " All that is delightful  all that
</p>
<p>the enthusiasm of romance can fling round the hu-
</p>
<p>man heart  is centred in my love of Ireland. She
</p>
<p>never has been a nation  for her own children had
</p>
<p>her split and rent asunder and divided when the
</p>
<p>Saxons first polluted her verdant soil with his ac-
</p>
<p>cursed foot." And is not that true, gentlemen  is
</p>
<p>it not literally true ? Have we not the authority of
</p>
<p>history for saying it is true ? Can these prosecu-
</p>
<p>tions wipe facts from ofT the face of history ? Pre-
</p>
<p>posterous idea ! Is not that true in reference to
</p>
<p>England herself as well as to Ireland ? Did not the
</p>
<p>Saxon with his accursed foot invade the land of the
</p>
<p>ancient Britons, banishing peace and happiness from
</p>
<p>their shores ? Wliat monstrous absurdity to expect
</p>
<p>that by a prosecution of this kind you can change
</p>
<p>and falsify the history of the human race ! For my
</p>
<p>part, I know not who the descendant of the Saxon
</p>
<p>is  ^neither does Mr. O'Connell. I know not where
</p>
<p>to look for the man, nor does Mr. O'Connell, upon
</p>
<p>whose shoulder I can put my hand and say, " You
</p>
<p>are one of the murderous Saxons who invaded this
</p>
<p>country in the time of the Britons." No ; it is mo-
</p>
<p>rally and physically impossible that any man could
</p>
<p>do so, for the blood of the conquerors and of the con-
</p>
<p>quered have long since intermingled, and the races
</p>
<p>are no longer distinct. Mr. O'Connell was alluding
</p>
<p>to the men and scenes of by-gone days, and that this
</p>
<p>was the fact is clearly to be seen by a perusal of suB-
</p>
<p>sequent passages of his speech. He then goes on to
</p>
<p>say, "From that day to this dissensions and divi-
</p>
<p>sions, together with a false confidence in the honour

</p>
<p>of the enemy, and penal laws, all, all have con-
</p>
<p>tributed to keep her in peril and degradation ; but
</p>
<p>the hour is come when her people can be a nation,
</p>
<p>and if they follow the counsel that they get, their
</p>
<p>country will be their own. I feel it now to be my
</p>
<p>duty to warn you against these Saxons." But who
</p>
<p>were the men whom Mr. O'Connell designated by
</p>
<p>the appellation of " Saxon ?" Surely he must have
</p>
<p>meant to refer to men who, like the Saxon, would
</p>
<p>invade this country with arms in their hands  men,
</p>
<p>who would decide arguments not by reason nor by
</p>
<p>justice, but by the sword and the bayonet. " Per-
</p>
<p>haps a few days \riU tell us what they mean."
</p>
<p>There again, says the Attorney-General, is deep
</p>
<p>sedition. What, allow me to ask you, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>could he have expected ? Where was the mili-
</p>
<p>tary organization  where was the training  where
</p>
<p>were the arms  where were the ofiicers ? Oh !
</p>
<p>but he had officers too I Did he not say that
</p>
<p>his men could follow the repeal wardens as well as
</p>
<p>the soldiers could follow the sergeants ? Did he
</p>
<p>mean by that, that they could follow them into the
</p>
<p>field of battle ? Yes, the kind of battle that he was
</p>
<p>fighting. That they would follow them to those
</p>
<p>peaceaTjle, legal, and constitutional meetings for
</p>
<p>exposing their grievances  he meant that they could
</p>
<p>follow them there. And yet you are told in eflfeot
</p>
<p>that he boasted they could follow their repeal war-
</p>
<p>dens to the battle ! A battle without arms  with-
</p>
<p>out discipline, without officers, without anything in
</p>
<p>the world calculated to make them anything except
</p>
<p>victims to be slaughtered. Are you, twelve gentle-
</p>
<p>men of sense, to be called upon to believe that ?
</p>
<p>Do you suppose that he would ever have let them
</p>
<p>know that he entertained those ideas if he really

</p>
<p>the body of their charter, entitling them to their
</p>
<p>land, a provision  that conscience should be free,
</p>
<p>and that religion should be unshackled by the atro-
</p>
<p>city of liuman persecution. They had in then- hearts
</p>
<p>the spirit of pure Christianity, and they proclaimed
</p>
<p>this as the free basis of their social association and
</p>
<p>compact  that Christianity was an affair between
</p>
<p>man and his Creator, and that the human law was
</p>
<p>atrocious that limited the operations of conscience.
</p>
<p>It is a delightful spectacle to witness such liberality ;
</p>
<p>and it is an equally gratifying fact to know, that
</p>
<p>some years afterwards, it being necessary to put
</p>
<p>this principle of religious freedom in the shape of a
</p>
<p>positive enactment, the law was immediately passed,
</p>
<p>there being four-fifths of the members of the legis-
</p>
<p>lature Catholics. Yes, these men were unanimous
</p>
<p>in carrying out that principle to the fullest extent
</p>
<p>in their official station in the colony, and that act
</p>
<p>of parliament was drawn up by a Jesuit
</p>
<p>Tlie Catholics, about the year 1672, got into power
</p>
<p>and authority again, and their first act was to pro-
</p>
<p>claim once again the principles of liberty of
</p>
<p>conscience I did not say that
</p>
<p>Irishmen would go over to cut down or oppose
</p>
<p>Englishmen seeking for their rights. I could not
</p>
<p>Bay anj'thing so absurd ; but I did say that if an
</p>
<p>attempt was made, no matter from what quarter,
</p>
<p>to subvert the throne, five hundred thousand Irish-
</p>
<p>men would be foimd ready to lay down their lives
</p>
<p>to defend it." Was that the statement of a man
</p>
<p>who sought power and ascendancy ? I ask, is there
</p>
<p>any good man in society that does not feel grateful
</p>
<p>to him for that statement ? There is the language

</p>
<p>of the man who is branded to you a foul conspirator,
</p>
<p>who you are told has treason in bis heart while he
</p>
<p>has peace on his tongue ! Do you believe it, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen?  let me ask you do you conscientiously
</p>
<p>come to that conclusion ? Again, " As to the Re-
</p>
<p>cabite society, or any other society, the members of
</p>
<p>which are known to each other by secret signs or
</p>
<p>pass-words, it is illegal, and subject those belonging
</p>
<p>to it to transportation." You remember, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, that it was said, thai the association was an
</p>
<p>illegal society, and that the cards were their pass-
</p>
<p>words ; the signs by which the members were
</p>
<p>known to each other. Well, let me ask you, what
</p>
<p>is a pass-word ? It is a secret sign by wliich the
</p>
<p>members of an illegal and criminal association are
</p>
<p>known to each other, without being known to other
</p>
<p>persons who are not members of that society. That
</p>
<p>definition of pass-word agrees with common sense.
</p>
<p>Well, did you ever hear of the members of any
</p>
<p>illegal and secret society going out in multitudinous
</p>
<p>assemblages and telling the whole world their pass-
</p>
<p>words ? Did not the members of the association go
</p>
<p>to the meeting with their cards in their hats ? And
</p>
<p>then you are called on to believe they were secret
</p>
<p>signs and pass-words. Such monstrous doctrine I
</p>
<p>have never heard. ReaUy, gentlemen, this is so
</p>
<p>absurd that I will not dwell on it longer. Again,
</p>
<p>hear Mr. O'Connell in September, 1841 :  " Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell moved that the newspaper be obtained
</p>
<p>wherein a statement was made by them (the Char-
</p>
<p>tists) that the sceptre and the cross should be pulled
</p>
<p>down together, and he believed that the greatest
</p>
<p>enemies both to religion and liberty, at present in
</p>
<p>existence, were those men. They would not listen
</p>
<p>to argument, they would not listen to reason, but

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>resolved not to suffer them to come into danger,, or
</p>
<p>kept them religiously within the bounds of law
</p>
<p>and order." Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>is it possible, let me ask you, to imagine that a man
</p>
<p>who would propound those liberal, those enlarged
</p>
<p>moral and religious feelings, and express them in
</p>
<p>such language  is it possible to believe that he, at
</p>
<p>the same moment, had the black heart and foul
</p>
<p>mind of a conspirator ? Then, at the association,
</p>
<p>on the 27th of September, 1841, he says:  "I am
</p>
<p>not for any sect or party, but for the good of the
</p>
<p>entire people. I care not what religious denomina-
</p>
<p>tion a man may have. I wish that every individual
</p>
<p>of the land sliould feel that he is an Irishman, and
</p>
<p>should desire to see his native country prosperous
</p>
<p>and happy." : . Will
</p>
<p>any of you, gentlemen, dissent from that sentiment ?
</p>
<p>Will any of you, by your verdict, tell the people of
</p>
<p>this country  the divided, distracted people of this
</p>
<p>country  that the man who preached those princi-
</p>
<p>ples of union, morality, and religion-amongst them
</p>
<p>is nothing but a conspirator ? Are they to be told
</p>
<p>that any man who preaches peace and order, unani-
</p>
<p>mity and abstinence from crime, is to be regarded as
</p>
<p>a conspirator ? Was he a statesman that directed
</p>
<p>those prosecutions ? Was he an honest man or a
</p>
<p>fool that directed them ? What did he hope to do
</p>
<p>for this country by a verdict of guilty against the
</p>
<p>man who preaches such doctrines ? Hear him again
</p>
<p>on the 5th of October, 1841 : " He was for obtain-
</p>

<p>MR. FITZGIBBON'S ARGUMENT FOR THE DEFENCE,
</p>
<p>313
</p>
<p>Kepealer, is a question which will never be asked by
</p>
<p>me of the man who comes to seek for redress or de-
</p>
<p>mand a right. 'Tis a question which shall be as fo-
</p>
<p>reign from the practice of my life  as it is foreign to,
</p>
<p>and abhorrent from, the character and principles of
</p>
<p>justice ? Can any man dissent from tliose expres-
</p>
<p>sions ? . . Will you convict him for these sen-
</p>
<p>timents ? Ask yourselves, as men and as christians,
</p>
<p>if you ought to do so ? I have no doubt of the an-
</p>
<p>swer that will be given. On the 9th of March, in the
</p>
<p>association, Mr. O'Connell said  " No, there shall
</p>
<p>not be one drop of blood shed in Ireland, as long as I
</p>
<p>live, in any political struggle whatever
</p>
<p>Man is not entitled to shed the blood of his fellow-
</p>
<p>creature, and the red arm of God's vengeance falls
</p>
<p>sooner or later on the murderer." There is truly and
</p>
<p>eloquently expressed the kind of force, the kind of
</p>
<p>power by which Mr. O'Connell expected to efiect the
</p>
<p>regeneration, as he conceived it to be, of his native
</p>
<p>land, not by the pike or the gun, not by the bayonet,
</p>
<p>but by tlie gigantic and electric force of public opi-
</p>
<p>nion in favour of justice by the aid of public.opi-
</p>
<p>nion, now more gigantic thau.it ever hai been since
</p>
<p>the creation of -the world. It is a century since
</p>
<p>.Xiocke, that immortal being, propounded to the
</p>
<p>world that of the three Idnds of law that exist  the
</p>
<p>law of God, political law, and the law of opinion 
</p>
<p>the latter had more universal influence on men's
</p>
<p>actions than the other two. Gentlemen, in his day
</p>
<p>the- press was comparatively powerless  in his day
</p>
<p>it would have been a difficult thing to arrest the at-

<p>rant of what France was doing, and France was ig-
</p>
<p>norant of what England was doing, and opinion was
</p>
<p>comparatively weak  it could have no effect what-
</p>
<p>ever upon nations but not so at the present day.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, what I am addressing to you to-day will,
</p>
<p>before to-morrow's sun rises, be at the other side 'of
</p>
<p>the channel. What I am to-day saying to you  what
</p>
<p>is heard by the few iu this court will, before to-mor-
</p>
<p>row's sun sets, pass through the mind, and be the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of opinion of many millions of your fellow-beings
</p>
<p> what I am now addressing to j'ou will be, before a
</p>
<p>second sun rises, upon the Atlantic on its way to the
</p>
<p>New World. Whether it be rational or not it will be be-
</p>
<p>fore the eyes of aU civilized mankind, as your verdict
</p>
<p>will be in this case. In March, 1843, the " Memory of
</p>
<p>theDead" has been referred to, and in January 1844, it
</p>
<p>has been read for you again with well practised em-
</p>
<p>phasis  and by-and-by you will be told that those
</p>
<p>who were under the guidance of Mr. O'Connell were
</p>
<p>reminded of those things for the purpose of inciting
</p>
<p>their passions. Gentlemen, that is a most unfair
</p>
<p>and mistaken construction to put upon it. See for
</p>
<p>a moment what the object in view was  ^it was to
</p>
<p>make Ireland the' seat of peace and quiet, in place
</p>
<p>of discontent, misdeeds, crimes, and bloodshed.
</p>
<p>And for this purpose it was necessary to remind the
</p>
<p>inhabitants in the strongest, most energetic, and
</p>
<p>emphatic language, of the woes and misfortunes
</p>
<p>brought upon their ancestors by having recourse to
</p>
<p>physical force. Now, take that as a clue to "re-
</p>
<p>member '98." Bemember the fathers of families
</p>
<p>having lost their lives at their own doors. Remem-
</p>
<p>ber the outrages on humanity that were perpetrated.
</p>
<p>Kemember they arose from insurrection. Let the
</p>
<p>blood stand in your remembrance ; but remember to

<p>with state perils, and that very hill passed the house
</p>
<p>of commons. But, mark what use Mr. O'ConneU
</p>
<p>makes of the fact. In his speech of the 14th No-
</p>
<p>vember, from which I have already quoted, he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to observe  " That should not, how-
</p>
<p>ever, lessen his allegiance, or diminish his re-
</p>
<p>spect and attachment to the admirable young
</p>
<p>Queen that holds the throne of these realms."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, is there a man amongst you who can put
</p>
<p>his hand upon his breast, and declare that he, in his
</p>
<p>conscience, believes that the man who uttered such
</p>
<p>language as this had any sympathies in connection
</p>
<p>with the dagger-men and the torch-men ? No  for
</p>
<p>what tongue could have held up to public scorn in
</p>
<p>more burning language of eloquent detestation than
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's the atrocious offences of the dag-
</p>
<p>ger-men and the torch-men ? I am come to a meet-
</p>
<p>ing of the association on the 20th December, 1841.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'ConneU spoke at that meeting, and, in allu-
</p>
<p>ding to the countenance and co-operation which the
</p>
<p>association Was in the habit of receiving from the
</p>
<p>repealers in America, expressed himself in the fol-
</p>
<p>lowirig language. He said :  " The association had
</p>
<p>no delegate, and he would add, never will have a
</p>
<p>delegate in America. They had no object in view
</p>
<p>which would render it necessary for them to have a
</p>
<p>delegate in any foreign or independent country.
</p>
<p>Tlieir American friends advised them to continue in
</p>
<p>the peaceable course of agitation which they had
</p>
<p>commenced, but at the same time to persevere to the
</p>
<p>end. They did not require of them to lessen their
</p>
<p>allegiance to the throne. If they gave any other
</p>
<p>advice, the Irish nation would spurn assistance with

</p>
<p>disdain ; but no, they encourage them to obey the
</p>
<p>laws, and to revere the constitution. . . . Let
</p>
<p>him not be misunderstood. What he said was, that
</p>
<p>they sought the same principle which the Americans
</p>
<p>did of self-legislation, but they were distinguished
</p>
<p>completely from the Americans in their mode of ac-
</p>
<p>tion in working that principle out, and wliile the
</p>
<p>Americans carried theirs to total separation, the
</p>
<p>people of Ireland were determined to adhere, with
</p>
<p>inalienable loyalty, to the crown of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>The cause of Ireland was like that of America in the
</p>
<p>principle of self-legislation. In other respects they
</p>
<p>differed  being free from violence and crime  tur-
</p>
<p>bulence and bloodshed." Such is the language of
</p>
<p>the man who is now arraigned before you as a con-
</p>
<p>spirator  as one who designed, by bloody and violent
</p>
<p>means, to subvert the law and trample on the con-
</p>
<p>stitution 1 And now, gentlemen, let me ask you, is
</p>
<p>this principle of self-legislation, alluded to by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'ConneU, a thing so obviously wrong.  so contrary
</p>
<p>to the well-being of your country  so obviously at
</p>
<p>variance with common sense and common justice,
</p>
<p>that the question is not to be discussed, and that the
</p>
<p>man who attempts its discussion is to be branded as
</p>
<p>a conspirator ? Is it a proposition so plain and. so
</p>
<p>palpable as to admit of no disputation, that the best
</p>
<p>parliament to legislate for this country is a parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, five-sixths of whose members are men who are
</p>
<p>in as blissful a state of ignorance as to the real state
</p>
<p>and condition of Ireland as was Mr. lloss, whose
</p>
<p>opinion of your countrymen, gentlemen, was such
</p>
<p>that he would not take 30,000/. to come over here
</p>
<p>avowedly in the character of a government reporter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Boss was so circumstanced that he had fully as
</p>
<p>good an opportunity of becoming acquainted with

</p>
<p>begotten by this great moral demnnstratinn of (he
</p>
<p>Irish people, and he takes his open car on the public
</p>
<p>road, accompanied only by his English friend, both
</p>
<p>known to be persons who had been sent there to
</p>
<p>take down what passed, and afterwards perhaps to
</p>
<p>prove it. We heard of no insolence being offered to
</p>
<p>him  nothing of the sort. They travelled back in
</p>
<p>perfect safety. This is the way in which Mr. Bond
</p>
<p>Hughes was treated by the people while he was act-
</p>
<p>ing in the capacity of a government agent. He
</p>
<p>crosses the channel again, and conies ovei' here to be
</p>
<p>a witness against the idol of this people. He swears
</p>
<p>his informations; he makes a great mistake; and
</p>
<p>there are circumstances which might give it the ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of being otherwise than unintentional.
</p>
<p>The first emotion of the man affected by it was to
</p>
<p>institute a prosecution against Mr. Hughes ; and
</p>
<p>steps were taken with that view. Mr. Hughes was
</p>
<p>indicted, and yet he came upon that table to stand
</p>
<p>the cross-examination of the Irish bar, with that
</p>
<p>impeachment  with that presumed blot upon his
</p>
<p>character ; he was to be cross-examined by mem-
</p>
<p>bers of that bar who, perhaps, are not remarkable
</p>
<p>for keeping terms with their opponents. He was
</p>
<p>cross-examined before you. And was there one
</p>
<p>single question put to him affecting his character,
</p>
<p>or importing that he was not a gentleman, in the
</p>
<p>fullest sense of the word? Is not that a great
</p>
<p>moral demonstration in Ireland (laughter among
</p>
<p>the bar). Who can deny it? Has Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>then, failed in any degree in first making, and then
</p>
<p>proclaiming to the world, that the Irish people were

<p>people ? Your verdict cannot take away the effect
</p>
<p>of that demonstration from the eyes of mankind.
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the event of this- trial  I cannot
</p>
<p>say that I am not an.xious about it  but whatever
</p>
<p>may be its event, Ireland has got a place in the
</p>
<p>history of nations, and in the opinion of mankind,
</p>
<p>which it is not in the power of any verdict, or any
</p>
<p>judgment, or any punishment to take away. Doc.
</p>
<p>27th, 1841, Mr. O'Connell again said, " The Queen,
</p>
<p>long life to her, who was the sincere friend of Ire-
</p>
<p>land, when she was, at least free, but she was then
</p>
<p>a prisoner in her own palace. She was a Sovereign
</p>
<p>who, with manly intrepidity, kept the advocates of
</p>
<p>bigotry from power for twelve months, and may
</p>
<p>God in heaven bless her for doing so."
</p>
<p>Here is the passage in his speech  the sentiment
</p>
<p>that Jackson misrepresented  but whether from de-
</p>
<p>sign or accident I will not say at present. I will
</p>
<p>read the passage just now for you ; but, in the mean
</p>
<p>time, let me tell you that Jackson came on that
</p>
<p>table purporting to be a reporter, and that he took
</p>
<p>notes and reported speeches made at the association.
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General  What is the date of that ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  September, 1841.
</p>
<p>Solicitor- General.  Mr. Jackson did not report
</p>
<p>then.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  No; but the sentiment is the
</p>
<p>same. The cross-e.\amination5 of Mr. Hughes and
</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson was the same, because they appeared
</p>
<p>then under different circumstances. Jackson did
</p>
<p>not represent himself as what he was : he was not a
</p>
<p>reporter, but a person who wrote long-hand; he
</p>
<p>was not capable of taking notes, and therefore it is
</p>
<p>no wonder that I assailed his accuracy, which I did,
</p>
<p>and nothing else : nor did I wish to assail anything
</p>
<p>316
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>crowned in his grave he was ? In the whole course
</p>
<p>of his eloquence, where you find him alluding to the
</p>
<p>possibility that if justice to Ireland is not granted,
</p>
<p>a violent separation of the two countries may take
</p>
<p>place, he never mentions it without designating it
</p>
<p>as one of the greatest evils that could befal both
</p>
<p>countries. Here is the man that intended civil war
</p>
<p>and bloodshed  such a man as Homer designates
</p>
<p>" brotherless, godless, houseless," is he that is de-
</p>
<p>sirous of war  a wretch, an outcast  without bodily
</p>
<p>tie to mortal man or living being  without a spiri-
</p>
<p>tual tie to his Creator or his God  without a re-
</p>
<p>sidence to hide his head upon earth. That is the
</p>
<p>only man who, according to the first of poets, could
</p>
<p>be fond of civil war. Is there anything in any-
</p>
<p>thing that ever was uttered by this first of his pro-
</p>
<p>fession  aye, I will also call him, the first of Irish-
</p>
<p>men for having preached those doctrines to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple  is there anytliing in this that could link him
</p>
<p>with the wretch I have described ? Again, he says 
</p>
<p>" He had heard, with a throb of pride and gratifi-
</p>
<p>cation, that the first soldiers to present themselves
</p>
<p>at the muzzles of 500 guns of the Chinese battery
</p>
<p>were the Royal Irish He was the loyal
</p>
<p>man, for he offered to England, for her protection,
</p>
<p>eight millions of undaunted hearts  gallant, hearty,
</p>
<p>devoted." Again, in the Register,
</p>
<p>there was a reported speech of the 4th of April,
</p>
<p>1842, in which Mr. O'Connell said  " Now, nothing
</p>
<p>could be more foolish, nay, more criminal, on the
</p>
<p>part of the repealers, than to be engaged in any
</p>
<p>transaction where riot took place, or blood was shed.
</p>
<p>He would sooner lose tlie assistance of the repealers

<p>of Manchester, valuable as it was, than he in con-
</p>
<p>nection with any party who would join in tumult or
</p>
<p>outrageof any kind. . . . He hoped tliey would
</p>
<p>never more hear of anything like what occurred at
</p>
<p>Manchester." .... Now, gentlemen, attend
</p>
<p>to this, for here is a sentiment that has been very
</p>
<p>strongly pressed against the traversers by counsel
</p>
<p>for the prosecution : "The Queen (he asserted it
</p>
<p>as a constitutional principle) had it in her power to
</p>
<p>revive the Irish parliament whenever she pleased.
</p>
<p>All he wanted was the sanction of the monarch of
</p>
<p>Ireland. The Scotch philosophers proved the Irish
</p>
<p>to be the first amongst tlie liuman race. The Queen
</p>
<p>should have the support of this first class. She had
</p>
<p>only to call on them in any emergency, and she
</p>
<p>would he triumphant They sought for
</p>
<p>nothing of a selfish or sectarian character ; they
</p>
<p>wished to do good to every man who was a sojourner
</p>
<p>in their land, no matter to what class or creed he
</p>
<p>might belong. . . . England would want Ire-
</p>
<p>land. The Queen might want Irishmen, and, be-
</p>
<p>yond all doubt, she should have them
</p>
<p>He would, while firmly attached to the throne, and
</p>
<p>determined to preserve the connection with England
</p>
<p>by the golden link of the crown  by every consti-
</p>
<p>tutional means  restore her parliament to Ire-
</p>
<p>land." The Attorney- General challenged the bar
</p>
<p>of the defendants to stand up and support, if they
</p>
<p>could, the assertion here made, that the Queen
</p>
<p>could, in the exercise of her prerogative, revive the
</p>
<p>Irish parliament and direct her writs to the com-
</p>
<p>mons of Ireland and summon a parliament to meet
</p>
<p>in Dublin. Now, gentlemen, don't leave out one
</p>
<p>part of Mr. O'Connell's sentence. That would not
</p>
<p>be fair. He says that he asserted it as " a constitu-

<p>fofget contempt.] He wished that to he particu-
</p>
<p>larly knoATO. He heard that in Belfast some of
</p>
<p>those Chartists had made an harangue at a repeal
</p>
<p>meeting. He trusted in future they would be al-
</p>
<p>lowed to hold their own meetings whererer they
</p>
<p>pleased, but that the repealers should have no con-
</p>
<p>nection with them Their rulers
</p>
<p>ought in time to conciliate the true-hearted and loyal
</p>
<p>people of Ireland. [See, obsen'ed Mr. Fitzgibbon,
</p>
<p>the principles of loyalty he is always inculcating.]
</p>
<p>The time might come when it would be necessary
</p>
<p>to call on them to support the crown and the insti-
</p>
<p>tutions of the country ; and if the day should come,
</p>
<p>he would not be wanting  his arm was as strong as
</p>
<p>ever it was, and he had no doubt that even in
</p>
<p>England he would eifect such an organization as
</p>
<p>would save the country from any revolutionary
</p>
<p>movement. Whilst they revered liberty, and were
</p>
<p>attached to religion, still they would respect the
</p>
<p>opinions of every human being in existence
</p>
<p>Great revolutions could be accomplished without
</p>
<p>the shedding of one drop of blood. He was the
</p>
<p>disciple of that new political religion which taught
</p>
<p>the lesson that moral power was amply sufficient to
</p>
<p>accomplish the liberties of mankind  that there
</p>
<p>would never be a necessity to fight for them. .

<p>Irish house of commons to meet for the despatch of

</p>
<p>treason ? Is that sedition ? Is that a proof of the

<p>dark conspiracy you were told of? What !  *' Her

</p>
<p>is that a crime ? Is it a crime that he advanced in
</p>
<p>1842 the opinions so eloquently expressed by others
</p>
<p>in the year 1800 ? Assuming it to be wrong  to be
</p>
<p>absurd  the question here is, is it evidence to you
</p>
<p>that a criminal conspiracy was formed by him ?
</p>
<p>Never, gentlemen, let it out of your minds for one
</p>
<p>instant that that is tlie narrow issue you have to
</p>
<p>try. Again, on the I6th May, at a repeal meeting,
</p>
<p>he (Mr. C'Connell) spoke to the same etfect? Is it
</p>
<p>not (continued Mr. Fitzgibbon) the principle of the
</p>
<p>British constitution  is it not the right of every
</p>
<p>British subject to express his dissent to every even
</p>
<p>imaginary grievance ? keeping within the bounds of
</p>
<p>the law. Mr. O'Connell has been abused ; it has
</p>
<p>been said that he raised a prejudice against men of
</p>
<p>property ; but has anything been read to you which
</p>
<p>could tend to such a conclusion? On the 21st of
</p>
<p>May, 1842, Mr. O'Connell made a speech at the
</p>
<p>association, in which he said  " They did not
</p>
<p>concur in any conduct that was violent, or outra-
</p>
<p>geous, or illegal  the way they looked for liberty
</p>
<p>for themselves, and the only way they could suggest
</p>
<p>to look for it, was by peaceable and constitutional
</p>
<p>efforts, embodying the strength of public opinion,
</p>
<p>and a total abstinence from any violation of the law,
</p>
<p>or outrage against morality .... They (the
</p>
<p>Americans) were mistaken in the allusions which
</p>
<p>they made to the possibility of the repeal cause
</p>
<p>ending in separation. No ; on the contrary, he was
</p>
<p>convinced that the repeal agitation was the only
</p>
<p>thing which would bind Ireland to England, and
</p>
<p>that the expectation of repeal was the feeling which
</p>
<p>would prevent separation. He had not the least

<p>doubt that if repeal was not granted, separation

<p>didn't prove, contained a report of the committee of
</p>
<p>the house of commons in Ireland of that day, and he
</p>
<p>told you that that committee reported to the house
</p>
<p>of commons that certain insurrectionary, disloyal,
</p>
<p>and rebellious associations had been formed, and he
</p>
<p>concluded by telling you that if he opened that book
</p>
<p>and read it to you, that the organization of that re-
</p>
<p>bellion, that criminal organization of '97 was the
</p>
<p>type and pattern from which the organization of the
</p>
<p>repeal movement had been copied. Now, I arraign
</p>
<p>that course of statement as illegal illegal in the
</p>
<p>highest possible degree ; for no counsel, no matter
</p>
<p>what his rank may be, has a right, in a criminal case,
</p>
<p>to attempt to affect the minds of the jury against
</p>
<p>the party accused by his own unsupported and un-
</p>
<p>sworn testimony. What right had the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General, in point of law, or in point of justice, or in
</p>
<p>point of common fair dealing, to insinuate to you, or
</p>
<p>to teU you that if he read that book it would demon-
</p>
<p>strate that the repeal agitation was copied from the
</p>
<p>organization of 1797, that had a rebellion for its ob-
</p>
<p>ject ? What right had he to do that in point of law
</p>
<p>or justice, or common fairness ? I arraign that
</p>
<p>statement of his as unfounded  as a totally unfounded
</p>
<p>statement ; and if his imagination traced for him, as
</p>
<p>I am quite sure it did, some likeness between the de-
</p>
<p>scription given of the organization of '97 and that of
</p>
<p>the present association, it was owing to his imagina-
</p>
<p>tion alone, and he utterly deceived himself ; and I
</p>
<p>think if he felt that, he liad no right to put that book
</p>
<p>in evidence. But when he knew that book would not

</p>
<p>be read in evidence what right had he to refer to it in
</p>
<p>his statement, or to attempt to draw those monstrous
</p>
<p>conclusions from it, that this peaceful, moral combi-
</p>
<p>nation, this legal association of 1843, was copied from
</p>
<p>that atrocious, that criminal rebellion of '98 ? Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the Attorney-General blinded himself ; his
</p>
<p>zeal bliiided him, it blinded him as to the facts of the
</p>
<p>case as well as to the law. He had much nearer
</p>
<p>home  much more obvious  that which was the
</p>
<p>true type of this association ; and now let me im-
</p>
<p>plore your attention for a moment or two. Catholic
</p>
<p>emancipation, which virtually had torn and agitated
</p>
<p>Ireland by amoral contest, but not by a physical force
</p>
<p>contest, or acriminal contest, a sinful or an immoral
</p>
<p>contest  after 29 years of a moral contest. Catholic
</p>
<p>emancipation was at last carried, and how ? Give
</p>
<p>me your attention for a few moments while I detail
</p>
<p>it to you. A private gentleman, Sir Valentine
</p>
<p>Blake, of Menlo Castle, a very ingenious man, fond
</p>
<p>of reading political acts of parliament affecting the
</p>
<p>rights of the Catholics of Ireland to prevent any con-
</p>
<p>stituency returning a Roman Catholic member as
</p>
<p>their representative  he propounded that plan, and
</p>
<p>I have not the least doubt that the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>and other lawyers who hear me would say, that there
</p>
<p>was as little law to sustain that doctrine as the one
</p>
<p>that the Queen could issue writs and summon a
</p>
<p>parliament in Ireland ; one was just as untena-
</p>
<p>ble in point of law as the other, and you will observe
</p>
<p>as I go on how striking is the likeness between
</p>
<p>the father and the son. Acting upon that sug-
</p>
<p>gestion, which I believe Sir Valentine Blake him-
</p>
<p>self communicated to Mr. O'Connell, the seat for
</p>
<p>Clare having been vacant in 1828, Mr. O'Connell

</p>
<p>nifestly bears on the face of it all the characteristics
</p>
<p>of truth, I defy him not to acknowledge that the
</p>
<p>explanation is satisfactory. The counsel for the
</p>
<p>prosecution would have you believe that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, when he came to the time of the monster
</p>
<p>meetings, had his sclieme ripening for a violent and
</p>
<p>treasonable insurrection in Ireland, for that he had
</p>
<p>in contemplation the trauiing of people to military
</p>
<p>operations, not by nightly drillings, but Inuring
</p>
<p>them to long marches, for that his meetings were
</p>
<p>held at a great distance from the respective houses
</p>
<p>of the people who attended them. By this means
</p>
<p>it was pretended that the people were habituated to
</p>
<p>march like the soldiery through the country. That
</p>
<p>is the interpretation put upon Mr. O'ConneU's pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding by the Attorney-General; but if Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell had it in contemplation to appeal to measures
</p>
<p>of physical force, and to organise the masses for
</p>
<p>that purpose, is it likely that he would have repu-
</p>
<p>diated and denounced the Chartists and whiteboys.
</p>
<p>The co-operation of the Chartists would have been
</p>
<p>invaluable for the carrying out of such an illegal
</p>
<p>project. He might at aU events have desisted from
</p>
<p>abusing them. He did not do so. If he had con-
</p>
<p>templated violence would such words as those have
</p>
<p>escaped his lips at a meeting of the association on
</p>
<p>the 1st of January, 1843 :  " He had received the
</p>
<p>most certain information that the societies which
</p>
<p>were estabUshed in England under the name of
</p>
<p>Chartists, or rather the branch of them named so-
</p>
<p>cialists, were making the greatest exertions to spread
</p>
<p>their fatal principles through Ireland. He was not
</p>
<p>going to accuse the Chartists generally, or anj'thing
</p>
<p>like universally, of being socialists, but a great

</p>
<p>number of the Chartists were socialists in England
</p>
<p>and Scotland, and all the socialists were Chartists.
</p>
<p>He was shocked to
</p>
<p>hear there were socialists in Dublin, and every man
</p>
<p>must hear it with sorrow ; it was the first time that
</p>
<p>such a misfortune had happened in Ireland. Hitherto
</p>
<p>they differed from one another in religious belief;
</p>
<p>there were Protestant, Catholic, Presbyterian, Dis-
</p>
<p>Beuter, and Methodist, but they were all Christians.
</p>
<p>Should such miscreants
</p>
<p>as those, he asked, be tolerated, and was he not en-
</p>
<p>titled to have the assistance of clergymen of every
</p>
<p>persuasion to put them down ?
</p>
<p>He proclaimed to them from that
</p>
<p>spot, that if they had anything to do with the
</p>
<p>Chartists or socialists, they would put themselves in
</p>
<p>their power, and be made the victims of their plans.
</p>
<p>He trusted that the sentiments he uttered on the
</p>
<p>subject would be circulated through the country,
</p>
<p>and that the honest shrewdness of the Irish people
</p>
<p>would induce them to take hold of those incen-
</p>
<p>diaries, and bring their acts to light." There is the
</p>
<p>language of a man who, if you are to believe the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, was at that moment organising
</p>
<p>his countrymen to make him the leader of an atro-
</p>
<p>cious republic  of a man who, it is insinuated, had
</p>
<p>in contemplation the wicked and nefarious design
</p>
<p>of arming the father against the son, and the son

<p>fecting the public. But I should be sorry that the
</p>
<p>cases in conspiracy against individuals, which have
</p>
<p>gone far enough, should be pushed still further. I
</p>
<p>should be sorry to have it doubted whether persons
</p>
<p>agreeing to go and sport upon another's ground  in

</p>
<p>Bule made absoliite." It should be remembered
</p>
<p>that the parties in that case had entered into a man's
</p>
<p>premises at night to rob him of his property ; and
</p>
<p>yet the court were unanimous in arresting the judg-
</p>
<p>ment. They went there with bludgeons for the
</p>
<p>purpose of intimidating any person they might have
</p>
<p>met. It might be said the present case was calami-
</p>
<p>tous to the public ; but that I deny. Tliere was no
</p>
<p>necessity to make the case double to obtain lawful
</p>
<p>ends by unlawful means. Crime may be defined in
</p>
<p>law books, but the law recognises no such thing as
</p>
<p>a definition, because a jury was the only tribunal to
</p>
<p>do that, and I don't tlynk you will have much diffi-
</p>
<p>culty in coming to a proper conclusion as to the
</p>
<p>charge of conspiracy in this case and pronouncing
</p>
<p>your verdict of acquittal on it. What man m so-

</p>
<p>to be charged with a conspiracy because he entered
</p>
<p>into an agreement with some other person to do
</p>
<p>some act that might be lawful, which some of the
</p>
<p>parties agreeing might endeavour to effect by means
</p>
<p>illegal, but from which he might innocently dissent.
</p>
<p>The proposition was monstrous and absurd. You
</p>
<p>may be told of cases in point, and a lawyer may be

<p>as earnest in citing his cases as I am now in address-

<p>every thing and any thing I may have said if it does
</p>
<p>not challenge respect from your reason. There are,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, one or two other topics upon which I
</p>
<p>have to address you. Do not blame me that my ad-
</p>
<p>dress has been so long. Believe me that I sincerely
</p>
<p>commiserate every one of you for being abstracted
</p>
<p>from your business, and while I do so believe me
</p>
<p>that I am myself an object of as much commisera-
</p>
<p>tion. Gentlemen, the situation of any man defend-
</p>
<p>ing his fellow-man from the imputation of a foul
</p>
<p>crime is an anxious one, and to me, naturally of an
</p>
<p>anxious temperament, as I must acknowledge my-
</p>
<p>self to be, it is a situation not devoid of pain ; and
</p>
<p>when I tell you that for the last three days I have
</p>
<p>not eaten half a pound of solid food  tliat for the
</p>
<p>last three nights 1 have not enjoyed five minutes'
</p>
<p>tranquil sleep  I am sure you will feel that I am not
</p>
<p>unworthy of commiseration; and feeling nly ex-
</p>
<p>haustion to be increasing, I would not, without ne-
</p>
<p>cessity, lengthen the effort I have made, and perhaps
</p>
<p>endanger the loss of my life to a family the eldest
</p>
<p>of whom is not six years old. But as long as any
</p>
<p>thing remains unsaid, which I believe is necessary
</p>
<p>to be said as long as I have strength to support
</p>
<p>me on my legs, I will proceed ; and 1 would retire
</p>
<p>to my bed unable to sleep for the remainder of my
</p>
<p>life, if I felt that I left unsaid any thing which I be-
</p>
<p>lieve I ought to have urged. I hope, therefore, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, that you will not blame me if I should ap-
</p>
<p>pear to be tedious. Another charge in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment is, that Mr. O'Connell and others conspired
</p>
<p>together to create disaffection in the army. The
</p>
<p>only evidence of that portion of the conspiracy is a
</p>
<p>letter written by a Mr. Power. Gentlemen, that

<p>and therefore held up the sergeants jind the whole
</p>
<p>army as a body of men not deserving disUke, but as
</p>
<p>a.bodyof men deserving love, respect, and affection.
</p>
<p>Why should he not be so interpretated ? The whole
</p>
<p>course of his life  the whole torrent of his eloquence
</p>
<p> everything he has ever said and ever done had
</p>
<p>for its object the establishment of love, order, and
</p>
<p>good will, amongst his fellow men. Every abusive
</p>
<p>expression he ever uttered I can trace to what he
</p>
<p>thought was some political act of turpitude on the
</p>
<p>part of some individual. He has, no doubt, often
</p>
<p>too strongly, and often censurably, expressed his
</p>
<p>dislike of political sentiments not agreeing with his
</p>
<p>own ; and don't think I am here to defend him for
</p>
<p>what he has done wrong, when he so far forgot that
</p>
<p>benignant nature which, beyond all doubt, belongs
</p>
<p>to him. Another imputation in this case is the
</p>
<p>collection of money, and I hope before I sit down to
</p>
<p>convince my friend Sergeant Warren that that money
</p>
<p>has been collected, not as the chesnuts have been
</p>
<p>drawn out of the fire, but fairly and legitimately
</p>
<p>collected. And I cannot advert to that unseason-
</p>
<p>able joke, which I have dealt with as an act in this
</p>
<p>case, ivithout at the same time expressing to you
</p>
<p>what I feel, that I don't believe there is a man in
</p>
<p>existence whose benevolent mind, and expanded and
</p>
<p>dignified understanding, and whose humane heart
</p>
<p>will be more thoroughly open to conviction when
</p>
<p>any man pleads before him the innocence of a human
</p>
<p>being tlian Sergeant Warren is ; and believe me,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, when I came do^vu on his joke with such
</p>
<p>severity as, perhaps, I did, I meant to apply my
</p>
<p>observation against tlie joke, and against any inju-
</p>
<p>rious effect which it might have on my client's in-

<p>terests in this very trying ease. Although I never
</p>
<p>can admit that a jest, no matter how innocently in-
</p>
<p>tended, in the slightest degree calculated to preju-
</p>
<p>dice a man on his trial  I never can admit the pro-
</p>
<p>priety, under any circumstances, of such a jest ; and
</p>
<p>although I shall never flinch from the duty of coming
</p>
<p>down with all the little force that nature and art
</p>
<p>has given me on a jest, under such circumstances,
</p>
<p>I hope I shall convince you that everything severe
</p>
<p>I have said of it was said only of the paltry thing
</p>
<p>itself, and not one word of it was said of the ti-uly
</p>
<p>dignified and amiable man who for a moment forgot
</p>
<p>himself when he uttered it. Ours is a peculiar state

<p>of society  justice which should he common to all

<p>of justice, as Home Tooke said, not intending to

<p>abuse courts of justice, or bring them into disre-

<p>of the proper courts of proper jurisdiction, without

<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>gobd deal of Unjustifiable language was, no doubt,
</p>
<p>used in reference to it. The act of the Chancellor
</p>
<p>Was dealt with in many publications in terms not
</p>
<p>expressing that respect he is entitled to. But theact
</p>
<p>was calculated to beget anger, and it did beget anger;
</p>
<p>but it produced no other effect. That, however,
</p>
<p>did not establish a conspiracy, nor did it exhibit a
</p>
<p>diabolical determination to bring into contempt the
</p>
<p>judicial tribunals of the country. When the magis-
</p>
<p>tfates were dismissed by the Chancellor, the people
</p>
<p>S6id in their turn that they would be up with hira
</p>
<p>by-and-by, and they, accordingly, made arbitrators
</p>
<p>fit those dismissed magistrates, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>deciding their differences with their own consent,
</p>
<p>but not of entertaining any cases except where both
</p>
<p>parties agreed to refer the matter in dispute to their
</p>
<p>adjudication. There was not a meeting of these
</p>
<p>arbitrators held throughout the country that was not
</p>
<p>pUblidly advertised ; every man in the community
</p>
<p>Knew that it was to take place, and every police-

<p>tfian in the district was at liberty to attend at them,

<p>iSothing wrong in all that. The adoption of these

<p>courts only shows the peaceful determination of the
</p>
<p>Irish people to forget all past differences, and settle
</p>
<p>atiy disputes that may arise between them through

<p>at any greater length on the subject, but that it is

<p>suggested to me to remind you of the Quakers, who

<p>don't go to law with each other. If they did, except

<p>more help it than I can help sleeping. My lords, I
</p>
<p>said I W.-1S not satisfied with what occurred yester-
</p>
<p>day; it was because I felt, and I feel, that what I

<p>said has operated upon that temper, which can

<p>no more be helped by the Attorney-General, than
</p>
<p>his breathing can be helped, to bring him into a

<p>false position, which, as I said before, he ounht not

<p>to stand in. He, my lords, is not deserving of cen-

</p>
<p>think he is deserving of censure, even for the little
</p>
<p>momentary impropriety into which irritation of feel-

<p>ing betrayed him. My lords, I trust that what I non-

<p>say will be satisfactory to his feelings. I had no

<p>lords, is all I wish to say ; and I trust I will not be

<p>considered to have abused the patience and attention

<p>of the court in saying it.
</p>
<p>This statement was listened to with considerable

<p>interest.
</p>
<p>A pause having then taken pl.ace for a short period,

<p>in anticipation of the Attorney-General addressing

<p>the court has no power to proceed with thi; trial,
</p>
<p>the term having end;d. We merely wish to men-

<p>opinion you may take a note of our objection.

<p>MR. waiTESIDE, Q.C. IN DEFENCE OF MR. CHARLES
</p>
<p>GAVAN DUFFY.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside said  May it please your lord-
</p>
<p>ships, and gentlemen of the jury, in this case I ap-
</p>
<p>pear before you as counsel for Charles Gavan Duffy,
</p>
<p>proprietor of the newspaper called the Nation. I
</p>
<p>could wish my client had selected his advocate from
</p>
<p>my brethren of the bar, where so many are to be
</p>
<p>found ray superiors in every talent, and every ac-
</p>
<p>quirement ; my sense of inferiority is increased by
</p>
<p>the disparity between my humble abilities and the
</p>
<p>task committed to my charge. Nevertheless, as-
</p>
<p>sured of your patience  convinced of your indul-
</p>
<p>gence  satisfied of your anxiety to hear candidly
</p>
<p>tvhat may be urged on behalf of the accused, from
</p>
<p>whatsoever quarter it may come  I gain resolution
</p>
<p>from my confidence in you. The solemnity of this
</p>
<p>state prosecution Avould be enough to hespeak your
</p>
<p>considerate attention. The principle involved in
</p>
<p>the issue  the all pervading anxiety of the public 
</p>
<p>the very nature of the accusation itself  combine to
</p>
<p>mark out this as a question of no ordinary expecta-
</p>
<p>tion. My anxiety is so to place before yoil the merit
</p>
<p>of my Client's case, that truth may prevail, and the
</p>
<p>^cause of public freedom triumph. I will not, at the
</p>
<p>outset, disguise from you that the result of tills case
</p>
<p>is regarded by me with trembling apprehension, not

</p>
<p>of proof permitted winch your own experieuce a3
</p>
<p>jurors tells you would not be suffered in any other
</p>
<p>proceedings. One man is sought to be affected
</p>
<p>here, not by ivhat he has liimself done, spoken, and
</p>
<p>committed, but by what other men have done,
</p>
<p>spoken, and committed. That an individual should
</p>
<p>suffer for the consequences of his own speeches and
</p>
<p>actions is natural and right, because he had power
</p>
<p>to control the one and regulate the other, but it
</p>
<p>would seem to he difRcult to understand the justice
</p>
<p>of the rule that fastens guilt on one man, not by
</p>
<p>what he has himself done against the law, but by
</p>
<p>what has been done by other persons at a distance,
</p>
<p>6ver whose movements he had no control  whose
</p>
<p>tongue he did not license  whose words he could
</p>
<p>not cheek, and over whose actions he had no autho-
</p>
<p>rity or power. If in ordinary cases that observation
</p>
<p>is founded on good sense, it is of infinitely more
</p>
<p>weight when you come to apply it to a charge of
</p>
<p>poUtical conspiracy. There it is necessary for a j ury
</p>
<p>to be infinitely more on tflieir guard, for the incau-
</p>
<p>tious language  the improper actions of one man may
</p>
<p>be charged as guilt against another. Look to the way
</p>
<p>in which it is sought to sustain the present charge.
</p>
<p>The proceedings of a meeting were first given, then
</p>
<p>the speeches at a dinner ; next came the editors of
</p>
<p>the Freeman and the Pilot, each charged with having
</p>
<p>published the extracts in their newspapers, respec-
</p>
<p>tively, for the purposes of this wicked conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and then comes the editor of the Nation, for having
</p>
<p>transcribed tliem into his weekly publication. That
</p>
<p>disposed of one meeting, and of a dinner, and so it
</p>
<p>went on from March to October. The indictment
</p>
<p>may well be divided into two parts, the first consist-

</p>
<p>ing of an octavo volume, large and ample in its re-
</p>
<p>ports, and giving copious details of speeches ; and
</p>
<p>the second forming an abridgment of proceedings
</p>
<p>at the association, the plan for the renewed action
</p>
<p>of the Irish parliament, the leading articles in the
</p>
<p>repeal newspapers, the angry letter of Mr. Power,
</p>
<p>the miscellaneous documents read at the association,
</p>
<p>and the whole forming a precious folio to please the
</p>
<p>tastes of the readers. Well, indeed, may I say that
</p>
<p>the guilt of any man must be difficult of proof
</p>
<p>which requires a document of such extraordinary
</p>
<p>prolixity to have explained to the jury, and that the
</p>
<p>innocence of that jierson must be clear indeed
</p>
<p>which needs such a mass of parchment to have it
</p>
<p>endangered or obscured. The traversers are ac-
</p>
<p>cused of a conspiracy to ci'eate discontent and dis-
</p>
<p>affection between the subjects of the Queen, to pro-
</p>
<p>mote among the people of tliis country feelings of
</p>
<p>ill-will towards their fellow-subjects in England, to
</p>
<p>promote disaffection in the army, and by the de-
</p>
<p>monstration of great pliysical force at their meet-
</p>
<p>ings to bring, about changes in the constitution and
</p>
<p>government of the realm. They are also charged
</p>
<p>for having conspired to bring into disrepute the
</p>
<p>courts of justice by the establishment of courts of
</p>
<p>arbitration, by inducing suitors to withdraw their
</p>
<p>cases from the lawful tribunals, and to have their
</p>
<p>differences adjusted by private individuals. This is
</p>
<p>the conspiracy charged ; and your duty is simply
</p>
<p>to try whether the accusation has been borne out
</p>
<p>by the facts given in evidence. The Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, who, I think, has stated the case on behalf of
</p>
<p>the crown with great moderation and good temper,
</p>
<p>began by stating what were the principles and the

</p>
<p>upon in support of a charge of conspiracy are ex-
</p>
<p>plained by proper averments in the indictment. The
</p>
<p>libel itself was not merely read but it was proved in
</p>
<p>evidence that it had the effect which it was asserted
</p>
<p>it actually had. In page 1,019 counsel for the crown
</p>
<p>stated that pikes were prepared, in the language of
</p>
<p>the libel, for the innocent purpose of self-defence 
</p>
<p>that was the excuse, and the pikes were produced,
</p>
<p>as was also the cutler who made them. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General more than once relied on the rule laid
</p>
<p>down in the charge in tliis case, and I beg your at-
</p>
<p>tention to it. Justice Korke said " that it was a
</p>
<p>matter of charity to believe that Lords Chatham
</p>
<p>and Camden, and Archdeacon Patey, and others,
</p>
<p>believed what they said in parliament in reference
</p>
<p>to the same subject, and if the conduct of the de-
</p>
<p>fendant had been merely a speculation of his own, it
</p>
<p>would have been a different thing, but when he had
</p>
<p>gone forth and expressed those opinions in a large
</p>
<p>assembly it would be for the jury to say whether he
</p>
<p>did not so address them with a view to inflame the
</p>
<p>minds and passions," and the man was found guilty.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, I don't see the value of the dis-
</p>
<p>tinction taken by the learned judge, that a man
</p>
<p>may broach certain opinions in parliament which
</p>
<p>another cannot express out of it. I don't think
</p>
<p>there is any such law, and I apprehend with great
</p>
<p>respect that his lordship was mistaken. The next
</p>
<p>case which the Attorney-General relied on was
</p>
<p>the King r. Watson, and Justice Bayley, in that
</p>
<p>case said, " It is not necessary that you should
</p>
<p>have the evidence of persons who heard the prisoners
</p>
<p>consult or conspire, if you are satisfied that there
</p>
<p>was a previous consultation or conspiracy, and the

</p>
<p>acts done were the result of that, you are at liberty
</p>
<p>to draw the conclusion that a conspiracy existed."
</p>
<p>In that case Sir C. Wetherell was counsel for Wat-
</p>
<p>son, and the jury, upon that charge, thought fit to
</p>
<p>acquit the prisoner. The next case quoted in the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General's statement was that of Redford
</p>
<p>and Birley, in the third part of Starkie's Reports,
</p>
<p>and that is a case which I think is more analogous
</p>
<p>to the present than any of the others. It was an
</p>
<p>action brought, not against the ciril authorities,
</p>
<p>but against the militar3', who had been called upon
</p>
<p>by them ; and one of the witnesses, named Andrews,
</p>
<p>proved, as stated in page 85, that he saw a number
</p>
<p>of persons going to Whitemoss to be drilled, and it
</p>
<p>was proposed to ask the witness whether he was
</p>
<p>alarmed, for the pui'pose of establishing the case.
</p>
<p>It was objected that the impressions made on his
</p>
<p>mind by those facts could not be given in evidence,
</p>
<p>but Justice Holroyd was of opinion that it.was re-
</p>
<p>ceivable, and the witness answered the question.
</p>
<p>He stated that he was asked whether he would go
</p>
<p>with them to get a big loaf for a little one ; that they
</p>
<p>would make their way to London, and would make
</p>
<p>use of the property of every one who had property
</p>
<p>as they went on the road, and that afterwards those
</p>
<p>seven hundred persons went to be drilled ; he added
</p>
<p>that he was alarmed, and the evidence of apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion was received. The learned counsel continued
</p>
<p>to refer, at considerable length, to the opinions of
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Holroyd, as they were reported in the
</p>
<p>case of Redford v. Birley and others, 3d vol. of
</p>
<p>Starkie's Reports. That learned judge, in page
</p>
<p>102, expressed his sentiments as to what consti-
</p>

<p>declining; to do so the cry of " spy," was raised
</p>
<p>against him, and chat the people cried out " kill
</p>
<p>him  murder him ;" that he and a man who accom-
</p>
<p>panied him to tlie fields had to fly for it ; that tliey
</p>
<p>were pursued by eiylity or ninety men, and that his
</p>
<p>companion was Icnocked down and kicked into a
</p>
<p>ditch; that he (witness) on a subsequent day was
</p>
<p>again pursued l)y tlie Huntites ; that he was knocked
</p>
<p>down and kicked ; that lie protested against such
</p>
<p>treatment, and said that he did not like that kind of
</p>
<p>reform in parliament ; that he was compelled to go on
</p>
<p>his knees and swear agaii.st the monarchical power ;
</p>
<p>tliat he was again beaten, and tlien permitted to re-
</p>
<p>turn to Manchester ] There was another witness ex-
</p>
<p>amined of the name of Asliworth, wlio, as reported
</p>
<p>in page 30/ of the same book, deposed that he heard
</p>
<p>the p2ople say tliat they would make a Moscow of
</p>
<p>I/Ondon ; and that he saw pike-heads, flags, and
</p>
<p>banners, with inscriptions on them, sucli as, " Btt-
</p>
<p>ter die like men than live as slaves," &c., &c. You
</p>
<p>see, gentlemen, what a strong analogy there obvi-
</p>
<p>ously exists between Hunt's movement and the re-
</p>
<p>peal movement (laughter). Don't they resemble
</p>
<p>each other in every feature and characteristic (laugh-
</p>
<p>ter). Gentlemen, it is monstrous  it is in the last
</p>
<p>degree preposterous, to endeavour to contend lliat
</p>
<p>any similarity exists ; for never were two cases
</p>
<p>more thoroughly and essentially diflerent. Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Bayly said the people carrying banners were
</p>
<p>alone liable to the penalty attached to the illegality
</p>
<p>or criminality of the act. I wish to call your
</p>
<p>lordships' attention tothatfact, for it appeared in the
</p>
<p>course of this trial that an arcli was erected across

</p>
<p>ing to a meeting, and it is sought to attach blame
</p>
<p>to thera for tlie intent of the parties erecting that
</p>
<p>arch. The Attorney-General iu his opening state-
</p>
<p>ment did not cite the recent cases of the Queen v.
</p>
<p>Vincent and others, out of 9 Carringtou and Payne,
</p>
<p>p. 95. He did not quote that case for
</p>
<p> Chief -lustice  I believe lie did.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  No, my lord, it was another case
</p>
<p>he cited, and I wish to call your particular attention
</p>
<p>^0 the charge preferred against the party then. The
</p>
<p>first count charged them with, that they being evil-
</p>
<p>disposed persons, did disturb the pulilic peace, and
</p>
<p>gxcite discontent and hatred, &c. in the minds of
</p>
<p>Jier Majesty's subjects. The 1 ith count was for a
</p>
<p>tumultuous assembly, and the 13th count was fur a
</p>
<p>riot. Hear the evidence given iu the case. Mr.
</p>
<p>Phillips, the mayor of Newport, swore that he went
</p>
<p>|o the meeting at eight o'clock on the evening of
</p>
<p>the 19th March, and that he heard Vincent address
</p>
<p>the assembly relative to the government. He de-
</p>
<p>scribed it .as a cannibal and atrocious system. He
</p>
<p>then referred to the people's charter, and said the
</p>
<p>?now-ball of Chartism would be hurled fiom the hill
</p>
<p>on their oppressors. Very like this case, is it not?
</p>
<p>(laughter.) He told the people if any policeman
</p>
<p>interfered with them to break his head. Very like
</p>
<p>what the traversers told the people, is it not? (re-
</p>
<p>newed laughter.) Mr. Johnston, a commercial tr.a-
</p>
<p>yeller from Liverpool, was examined, and stated that
</p>
<p>he had a conversation with Townsend, who wanted
</p>
<p>him to supply three hundred muskets, six hundred
</p>
<p>cutlasses, and pistols in proportion ; but he refused
</p>
<p>to furnish arms for such an abominable purpose.

</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  I suppose you do not mean
</p>
<p>to say they are to find that the traversers committed
</p>
<p>every overt act ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Certainly not, my lord ; but I
</p>
<p>say they must find them guilty on any count of one
</p>
<p>and the same conspiracy. The overt acts are quite
</p>
<p>distinct from the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton I wish to know, Mr. White-
</p>
<p>side, in what way the book you handed up to us is
</p>
<p>authenticated ?
</p>
<p>Mr, Whiteside The publication of that book was
</p>
<p>by a man who was candid enough to state the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of his own conviction  Mr. Feargus
</p>
<p>O'Connor (laughter).
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Burton  Then, this is an account of
</p>
<p>the trial by him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Yes, my lord, and he, a lawyer,
</p>
<p>states that he was satisfied that lie was tried accord-
</p>
<p>ing to law, and that he was punished accordingly
</p>
<p>(a laugh). The whole was taken in short-hand by
</p>
<p>him. Gentlemen, the Attorney-General may make
</p>
<p>out this conspiracy by one or two means  first, posi-
</p>
<p>tive and express proof that the traversers entered
</p>
<p>into the agreement to do these acts  or he may make
</p>
<p>it out by inference from the several matters which
</p>
<p>hav been given in evidence before you. There is
</p>
<p>no evidence of e.xpress agreement to do these things,
</p>
<p>so that we come at once to the second part. The
</p>
<p>object of Mr. Duify is to accomplish tlie repeal of a
</p>
<p>cert.iin act of parliament, called the act of union,
</p>
<p>commonly called the 40tli of George III. The ob-
</p>
<p>ject he had and has in view is perfectly legal. No
</p>
<p>parliament can make a law that another parliament
</p>
<p>cannot unmake. The legislature of one period can-

</p>
<p>not bind or fetter the legislature of another  if so,
</p>
<p>absurd and cruel laws would become perpetual. A
</p>
<p>great body of evidence had been given and received.
</p>
<p>The act of Mr. Duffy is received because he is on
</p>
<p>trial the act of Mr. O'Connell is received because
</p>
<p>he is on trial  the act of Dr. Gray is received be-
</p>
<p>cause he is on trial ; and the speech of Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>for the same reason ; but if my client agreed with all
</p>
<p>or any of them for a legal and commendable object,
</p>
<p>he is not reiponsible for the intemperate eff"usions
</p>
<p>of their mind ; and these matters are received be-
</p>
<p>cause they are their acts, but not evidence to fix
</p>
<p>guilt on my client. The first thing I direct your
</p>
<p>attention to is the vast meetings that have been
</p>
<p>held throughout the country. They commenced on
</p>
<p>the 19th of March, 1843, and terminated in Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, in the same year Now I observe that there is
</p>
<p>complaint of those meetings as unlawful  no charge
</p>
<p>of riot  of a breach of the peace, or tendency to
</p>
<p>it-r-no charge of assault on persons, or that pro-
</p>
<p>perty was endangered ; therefore you are required
</p>
<p>to believe, strange enough, that attending at those
</p>
<p>meetings, and causing those meetings to be held,
</p>
<p>which are not for an unlawful purpose, are overt
</p>
<p>acts to prove a guilty conspiracy, such as is laid in
</p>
<p>the indictmeut. I care not for the words in this

<p>indictment, that there was an " exhibition of phy-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>from the London News of April 27th, 1834, by which
</p>
<p>it appeared that those 200,000 men marched in
</p>
<p>miUtary array  live men deep, vith banners and
</p>
<p>insignia, &c.] Now, gentlemen, what is the result of
</p>
<p>those 200,000 pepole marching through the streets
</p>
<p>of London, with flags and banners, uninterrupted
</p>
<p>by any person ? and what is stated by the prime
</p>
<p>minister of England sensibly is this  200,000 persons
</p>
<p>coming to the seat of government to present a
</p>
<p>petition is a thing that cannot be sanctioned liy the
</p>
<p>government. He says, your meeting is justifiable 
</p>
<p>your petition is justifiable  your conduct is justifi-
</p>
<p>able ; I shall have no objection to lay your remon-
</p>
<p>strance before the king, but I cannot receive a peti-
</p>
<p>tion from a deputation of 200,000 persons. I admit
</p>
<p>that you had a right to meet and come to that con-
</p>
<p>clusion  send it to me to-morrow and I shall lay it
</p>
<p>before the king. Where is it suggested those men
</p>
<p>arc guilty of conspiracy for meeting for those objects
</p>
<p>with flags and banners, and marching through the
</p>
<p>streets of London? The police of London were
</p>
<p>ordered to leiive the ground except there was a ten-
</p>
<p>dency to riot and confusion, and there was neither.
</p>
<p>But the right objection is taken to that meeting,
</p>
<p>that where sijch a large body of men shall proceed
</p>
<p>to the king or the houses of parliament, that is a
</p>
<p>proceeding that ought not to be sanctioned or esta-
</p>
<p>blished as a precedent. An account of that meeting
</p>
<p>is given in the Morning Post of the day. It com-
</p>
<p>mends the conduct of the government in not inter-
</p>
<p>fering with the meeting, and, speaking with regard

<p>to the brickbat and the bludgeon. I shall next have
</p>
<p>to refer to a meeting of the Birmingham political
</p>
<p>union, held October 8th, 1831. I will state the
</p>
<p>rules of that body when I come to discuss the con-
</p>
<p>stitution of this assembly, which, as the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General said, was illegal :  " Grand meeting of the
</p>
<p>Birmingham and other political unions of the mid-
</p>
<p>land districts  On Monday, in pursuance of adver-
</p>
<p>tisements issued by the council of the Birmingham
</p>
<p>political union, a public meeting of the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of the town and neighbourhood took place oft' New
</p>
<p>Hall Hill, for the purpose of demonstrating to the
</p>
<p>house of lords that the public enthusiasm in favour
</p>
<p>of the reform hill is not abated, and in order to pe-
</p>
<p>tition the right honourable house to give their final
</p>
<p>sanction in carrying that great measure into a law
</p>
<p>without delay. The spot fixed upon for the scene
</p>
<p>of this amazing spectacle was New Hall Hill, a large
</p>
<p>Tacant spot of ground situated in the northern
</p>
<p>suburbs of tlie town. It consists of about twelve
</p>
<p>acres of rising land, in the form of an amphitheatre.
</p>
<p>In the valley a number of waggons were ranged in
</p>
<p>half circle, the centre one being appropriated to the
</p>
<p>chairman, and the various speakers who addressed
</p>
<p>the meeting. About half-past eleven o'clock, the
</p>
<p>Birmingham Union, headed by Messrs. Attwood,
</p>
<p>Scholefield, Muntz, Jones, &c., and preceded by the
</p>
<p>land, began to arrive, but such were their numbers
</p>
<p>that a considerable time elapsed before all had taken
</p>
<p>their stations on the ground. The scene at this
</p>
<p>moment was peculiarly animated and picturesque ;
</p>
<p>at diiferent points of the procession various splendid
</p>
<p>banners were carried, on which were as varied de-
</p>
<p>vices and mottoes ; among the latter we noticed,

<p>and old engaged in those factories vere white slaves
</p>
<p>slaves living under the heneficent rule of England,
</p>
<p>and worse off, as they describe it, than the black
</p>
<p>slaves that their children were forced to work when
</p>
<p>tliey did not possess strength to do so, and sjieeehes
</p>
<p>and songs were made about this grievance. I shall
</p>
<p>now quote from the Vork Htrald and General Adver-
</p>
<p>tiser of the 28th April, 18!2, and I will show how
</p>
<p>they met:  "Great Yorkshire meeting in support
</p>
<p>of the ten hours' factory bill  This great meeting,
</p>
<p>in support of justice and huinanity, was held in the
</p>
<p>Castle-yard on Tuesday last. According to the
</p>
<p>programme the various divisions of operatives en-
</p>
<p>tered Leeds from Halifa-x, Hudderstield, Brad-
</p>
<p>ford, Dewsbury, Heckmondwicke, ICeighley, Holm-
</p>
<p>firth, &c. &c., ^rith their flags and music. They
</p>
<p>repaired to the White Cloth Hall Yard, wliere re-
</p>
<p>freshment was served to those who, from want of
</p>
<p>employment, could not afford to supply their own
</p>
<p>wants. The first Leeds division left that town at
</p>
<p>eleven o'clock at night, and the second an hour after."

</p>
<p>the procession, banners, &c., and an extract from
</p>
<p>the speech of Mr. Oastler, and proceeded]  Mr.
</p>
<p>Oastler did not mmce the matter. Kothiug could
</p>
<p>be more distinct or emphatic than his language. He
</p>
<p>began by saying that they had come together to give
</p>
<p>a vote against the unendurable white slavery. He
</p>
<p>denounced the aristocracy, and declared that the
</p>
<p>wealth they possessed was the jiroceeds of their sweat
</p>
<p>and labour. Did any Attorney-General ever say
</p>
<p>that because those men combined for a common ob-
</p>
<p>ject the means they took were illegal V And yet,

<p>with lighted flambeaux in thousands  some of them

<p>came si.\ty, seventy, eighty, or a hundred miles  to

<p>do what? ' To demand that the manufacturers should
</p>
<p>recognise their claims ; that the legislature should

<p>listen to their grievances  shoiild discuss those
</p>
<p>grievances  should redress them ; that they should
</p>
<p>listen to the call of humanity on their behalf, and
</p>
<p>that they should do those artisans that justice which
</p>
<p>I hope yet will be done to the poor labourers of Ire-
</p>
<p>land. Gentlemen, there is an account given in a
</p>
<p>publication, fi'om which I shall read some extracts
</p>
<p>to you, of the means whicli were employed in order
</p>
<p>to get that act of parliament passed. And what do
</p>
<p>you suppose they call these gatherings ? Pilgrimages
</p>
<p>of mercy. Than the language of these publications
</p>
<p>nothing could be more exciting ; they held the manu-
</p>
<p>facturers to be almost worse than the negro slave
</p>
<p>owners  -they insist that tlie law shall be altered 
</p>
<p>they prevail, and the law is altered. Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, I will now draw your attention to the
</p>
<p>meeting which was held at Hillsborough, and which
</p>
<p>I think Mr. Shell spoke of to you, and I will take
</p>
<p>the report of it from the Dublin Evening Mail of the
</p>
<p>31st of October. The men of the north are de-
</p>
<p>scribed as having done their duty well, and I am
</p>
<p>happy to hear it. I admire them and I like them
</p>
<p>for it. They marched to Hillsborough, "in border
</p>
<p>fashion," to express what?  that the men of the
</p>
<p>north were determined that the union should be
</p>
<p>maintained, and that tliey would stand by the go-
</p>
<p>vernment in maintaining it with their lives and
</p>
<p>fortunes. They marched there to express that de-
</p>
<p>termination  ^by what means? by what is called, in

<p>the language of this indictment, " the demonstration

<p>all. I am sure, gentlemen, you will show that you
</p>
<p>are not insensible to the benefits of that constitu-
</p>
<p>.tion, of which you are this day in some degree the
</p>
<p>guardians, and that when a bona fide meeting is
</p>
<p>called for bona fide, purposes, and not as a mask to
</p>
<p>conceal or cover an intention to pull down the insti-
</p>
<p>tutions of the country and spread ruin and devasta-
</p>
<p>tion through the land, that such a meeting is not
</p>
<p>a violation of the letter of the law or the spirit of
</p>
<p>the constitution. And now, gentlemen, I will take
</p>
<p>the liberty of directing your attention to the general
</p>
<p>pharacter of the meetings, as it is demonstrated by
</p>
<p>the general tenor of the evidence, for I will take the
</p>
<p>gvidence en masse in this respect, and will not go
</p>
<p>through the meetings seriatim. Analyse with ac-
</p>
<p>curacy the testimony which has been given upon
</p>
<p>this brancli of the case, and carefully compare it
</p>
<p>with the testimony wliich might liave been given.
</p>
<p>Kank and file, we had the whole police establish-
</p>
<p>pient of Ireland upon the table. I mean that there
</p>
<p>is no rank, office, or degree in the constabulary de-
</p>
<p>partment, a representative of which has not been
</p>
<p>brought before you, gentlemen, in the character of

<p>evidence might have been very important, and

<p>dence as to the true character of the monster meet-
</p>
<p>ings. During the few weeks of respite which your
</p>
<p>lordships were kind enough to permit us, we ap-
</p>
<p>pointed agents throughout every district of the
</p>
<p>country, to whom we assigned the duty of discover-
</p>
<p>ing what acts of violence, if any, had been com-
</p>
<p>mitted at those meetings  whether tlie person of
</p>
<p>any man had been assaulted, and whether the pro-
</p>
<p>perty of any man had been injured  whether men
</p>
<p>who differed on political points from the traversers
</p>
<p>felt terror or alarm at the meetings ; and we can
</p>
<p>prove by evidence the most incontestible that no
</p>
<p>one of these tilings was ever known to have oc-
</p>
<p>curred. No alarm was felt by any rational man in
</p>
<p>the community, for no injury was any wliere offered
</p>
<p>to life, character, or property. Indeed, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>you have had this fact demonstrated even on tlie
</p>
<p>evidence of the crown themselves. From east to
</p>
<p>west, in no single instance was there an infraction
</p>
<p>of the law  of good order or decorum  no exhibition
</p>
<p>of arms of any kind. No violence^no intimidation
</p>
<p>-no alarm  no terror  in no instance was one man
</p>
<p>injured or insulted by another  tlie people went by
</p>
<p>masses to tliose meetings  men, women, and chil-
</p>
<p>dren, and so admirable was their conduct and their
</p>
<p>arrangements that not even an accident occurred.
</p>
<p>Vhy did not tlie crown ask the witnesses whom
</p>
<p>they brought upon the table whether they knew of
</p>
<p>any alarm having been created by this movement ?
</p>
<p>If the meetings were held with, as the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General insinuates, the purpose of instilling awe into
</p>
<p>the public mind, why did he not bring witnesses from
</p>
<p>;MaUow, from Baltinglass, or from any otlier of the
</p>
<p>districts that were the scenes of the monster meet-

<p>SSI
</p>
<p>pfore that petitions from these meetings were never
</p>
<p>lodged in the liouse of commons. But he has not
</p>
<p>brought evidence to prove anytliing of the kind, nor
</p>
<p>would it have been of consequence even though he
</p>
<p>had. We did adopt petitions at all these meetings,
</p>
<p>and the contrary is not to be assumed, because for-
</p>
<p>sooth the petition may not have followed imme-
</p>
<p>diately on the track of the meeting. Mr. Erskine,
</p>
<p>in Hardy's case, distinctly expressed it as his opi-
</p>
<p>nion that a meeting was not to be deemed criminal
</p>
<p>or illegal because the petition may not have been
</p>
<p>prepared with panting expedition. It was contem-
</p>
<p>plated by the repealers that the repeal petitions,
</p>
<p>like the Chartist petitions, should be held over until
</p>
<p>thousands upon thousands of signatures had accu-
</p>
<p>mulated, in order tliat when at length they were
</p>
<p>brought under the consideration of the house they
</p>
<p>might produce a deeper and more serious impres-
</p>
<p>sion upon the public mind. It was sought to be
</p>
<p>proved that the people m.arched to those meetings in
</p>
<p>military array. But wlien a witness was produced
</p>
<p>to prove the fact, he was asked did they keep the
</p>
<p>step, and he said no ; and indeed I defy any man to
</p>
<p>Ifeep the step to such music as is played by the tem-
</p>
<p>perance bands (laughter) ; and because the people
</p>
<p>did not march with regularity, oh, says the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General, that's rank sedition (laughter). He
</p>
<p>hears some attempt made by a parcel of boys in the
</p>
<p>country to play some tune, and up he starts, and
</p>
<p>says that's rank treason (loud laughter). They
</p>
<p>don't play party tunes, however, these temperance
</p>
<p>bands ; no, they are not like the music  tlie good
</p>
<p>and loyal music  played by the bands in the north
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Oh, dear, not at all (loud laughter).

<p>I'll tell you the music they play there, " The Pro-
</p>
<p>testant boys will carry the day" (great laughter).
</p>
<p>'' The Boyue Water," and oh, the croppies lie down,
</p>
<p>of course, "Down, down, croppies lie down" (im-
</p>
<p>mense laughter). These are the royal tunes in the
</p>
<p>north, they despise all others in the world, and
</p>
<p>many a broken head, and black eye, and sore arm,
</p>
<p>has resulted from not joining with the loyal bands
</p>
<p>who play those loyal tunes (a laugh). But they don't
</p>
<p>play God save the Queeu there at all, and because
</p>
<p>the temperance bands play it, oh, says the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General, that's rank treason (great laughter).
</p>
<p>Well, when we come to deal with the bands, they
</p>
<p>had colours flying  they had uniforms  they were
</p>
<p>in fact fine fancy fellows, swaggering awaj', thump-
</p>
<p>ing a big drum, and playing God save the Queen.
</p>
<p>How fearfully annoying and seditious that to loyal
</p>
<p>ears (laughter). Why, I tell you what, gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>never heard sucli music as the temperance bands
</p>
<p>play. I defy auy man but a policeman to march to it.
</p>
<p>I heard one the other day coming from Mr. Purcell's,
</p>
<p>and I could have sincerely wished it any place else
</p>
<p>at the time. Ah, but because the poor fellows who
</p>
<p>cqmpose the temperance bauds through the country
</p>
<p>don't go to the public-house now at night, get drunk
</p>
<p>^nd break each others heads as heretofore, because
</p>
<p>they don't do that, but indulge in playing their
</p>
<p>musical instruments, why, it is said by the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General it is distorted by a supple understand-
</p>
<p>ing  it is twisted into a foul and rank conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Well, I think the charge was not far wide of the
</p>
<p>mark, for I never heard of a fouler or a darker con-
</p>
<p>spiracy  to do what though ?  to murder harmony

<p>(roars of laughter). Oh, yes, these temperance

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>before the meeting. I rely strongly on that.
</p>
<p>Does not that fact tell strongly in favour of my
</p>
<p>clients ? I will turn now to what occurred at Mul-
</p>
<p>laghmast. We don't object to the evidence given
</p>
<p>as to the banners and flags, and what he said at the
</p>
<p>meetings where they were used, although Mr. Jus-
</p>
<p>tice Bayly says, evidence should only be given of
</p>
<p>what was said of them, or unless they were within
</p>
<p>view of the speakers. If the meeting at MuUagh-
</p>
<p>mast was illegal then there is an end to all meetings.
</p>
<p>"What is the test of an illegal meeting ? I will try
</p>
<p>it by the test of the meeting at Hillsborough the
</p>
<p>speeches, banners, flags, the conduct of the people
</p>
<p>going to and coming from it ; and, gentlemen, these
</p>
<p>things are to be looked at and considered with the
</p>
<p>eye of a Christian, and as men who respect the pri-
</p>
<p>vileges of the constitution, and not with the cap-
</p>
<p>tious eyes of a lawyer. You are not to find men
</p>
<p>guilty of different motives to what they avow them-
</p>
<p>selves. The Marquis of Downshire, and some of
</p>
<p>the highest men in the land, were at Hillsborough,
</p>
<p>with their tenantry at their backs ; and if a ballad-
</p>
<p>singer from Belfast came there to sell a slanderous,
</p>
<p>wicked, disgusting production, are they to be tried
</p>
<p>for it because they spoke from the hustings ? No  
</p>
<p>this should not be. Is it because an ill-minded,
</p>
<p>illiterate fellow  a spy  soils that production for
</p>
<p>the eager eyes of those who are willing to buy any-
</p>
<p>thing oflered to them  that others should be pro-
</p>
<p>secuted ? Is what a ballad-singer vends at Mullagh-
</p>
<p>iiiast to be acted on and given in evidence. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the jury, you should ask has Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>sanctioned it. Where is the evidence that he did ?
</p>
<p>Where is the man to prove that he was ordered to

</p>
<p>do it? What is the proof given by the crown?
</p>
<p>They have produced the printer, Mr. Browne, the
</p>
<p>printer of the association ; but there is not a particle
</p>
<p>of evidence to prove any order for the printing of
</p>
<p>it, and then the Attorney-General says we should
</p>
<p>produce the printer. The Attorney-General says
</p>
<p>he proved all that he had to prove. I complain that
</p>
<p>he has kept back the witness who could have proved
</p>
<p>the printing of this ballad. It is uot our duty to
</p>
<p>bring him forward. They have ascribed guilt to us,
</p>
<p>and they should prove it. And, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, although the evidence as to that ballad has
</p>
<p>been received by the court, it is not evidence against
</p>
<p>us as it is not proved that we had any common in-
</p>
<p>tent with the person who printed or sold it; and
</p>
<p>even if one of the traversers had caused it to be
</p>
<p>printed, it is not evidence against the others unless
</p>
<p>they had agreed to the printing. If the placards
</p>
<p>used at the meetings are not evidence against us,
</p>
<p>unless proved to have been used by preconcert,
</p>
<p>union, and combination, how can this ballad be evi-
</p>
<p>dence unless proved to have been similarly used ?
</p>
<p>The court here retired for the usual time. When
</p>
<p>their lordships returned,
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside continued  Gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>I shall now draw your attention to some portions of
</p>
<p>what was said at those meetings, and as you have
</p>
<p>heard Mr. Fitzgibbon allude to some of the best pas-
</p>
<p>sages in Mr. O'Connell's speech, I will take up a few
</p>
<p>of what may be considered the worst. I will first
</p>
<p>observe that many of those speeches are not actually
</p>
<p>proved to have been spoken by Mr. O'Connell. The
</p>
<p>nature of the accusation enables the party accusing
</p>
<p>to put in a number of papers containing, as it is
</p>
<p>MP. WHITESIDE'S ARGUSIENT FOR THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>333
</p>
<p>that Sir. O'CouncU was to utter what he did in re-
</p>
<p>tort? Mr. O'Connell felt justly incensed against
</p>
<p>Lord Beaumont for the contumelious language ap-
</p>
<p>plied to him ; for whatever might be his faults, he
</p>
<p>had certainly a place in the history of his country ;
</p>
<p>he had a European name. There was a badness of
</p>
<p>taste, a coarseness of manner, and a weakness of
</p>
<p>judgment exhibited by liis lordship in this attack,
</p>
<p>which showed that a vulgar Irish peasant might be
</p>
<p>more polite than an hereditary member of the Bri-
</p>
<p>tish parliament. Mr. O'Connell had also said, " I
</p>
<p>will take care you will do no wrong ; but if they
</p>
<p>attack us we will do so and so." This was ex-
</p>
<p>plained by another observation  that they must dis-
</p>
<p>cuss the question -nith the repealers  that they must
</p>
<p>hear them, and that they were not to be put down
</p>
<p>without being heard. What could be more absurd
</p>
<p>than to say that because on the arrival of certain
</p>
<p>news from London, Mr. O'Connell makes use of
</p>
<p>certain words, every one who agrees with him on
</p>
<p>the subject of repeal, or any other subject, must
</p>
<p>be liable to be prosecuted for his words ? Besides,
</p>
<p>the physical condition of a speaker is to be consi-
</p>
<p>dered at the time he delivers his speech. Those
</p>
<p>were generally after-dinner speeches, and I have no
</p>
<p>doubt if Mr. Attorney-General himself were to get
</p>
<p>up after dinner, well primed with a speech upon
</p>
<p>church and state, he would be much more bold,
</p>
<p>animated, and excited than he was in this court
</p>
<p>(.laughter). There would be a great deal of what is
</p>
<p>termed inflammatory matter in his address, and it
</p>
<p>would not be a bit the worse for it (.laughter).
</p>
<p>Much has been said about the use of the word " fo-
</p>
<p>reigner," by Mr. O'Connell. Let it be remembered

<p>that he had legal authority for the use of the word.
</p>
<p>In the case of Mahony v. Ashley, 3rd Barnwell and
</p>
<p>Adolphus, page 482, in the case of an action for a
</p>
<p>bill of exchange, it was argued that Ireland was a
</p>
<p>foreign country. This was denied on the other side,
</p>
<p>because of the union. The objection was overruled,
</p>
<p>and Ireland was solemnly decided to lie a foreign
</p>
<p>country. With regard to the language that had
</p>
<p>been used by Jlr. O'Connell, respecting Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel and the Duke of Wellington, it is purely per-
</p>
<p>sonal matter ; and wlien he spoke of having more
</p>
<p>physical force than had been present at Waterloo it
</p>
<p>was a mere boastful expression of pride, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of showing that as large meetings at Hillsboro'
</p>
<p>and in England had marched shoulder to shoulder
</p>
<p>to accomplish their object, so those meetings of
</p>
<p>equal numbers must have their complaints discussed.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General alluded to Sir Robert Peel's
</p>
<p>declaration in parliament, of her Majesty's intention
</p>
<p>to maintain the union inviolate. That declaration
</p>
<p>possessed no legal authoritj'. We only knew what
</p>
<p>passed in parliament by a breach of privilege, and
</p>
<p>to force us to read the speeches of the members would
</p>
<p>be an act of intolerable despotism. If a gentleman
</p>
<p>stood up and put a question to Sir Robert Peel and
</p>
<p>he replied  was that to atfect the law, rights, and
</p>
<p>liberties of the people? The converse of that doc-
</p>
<p>trine was laid down by Lord Mansfield, who said,
</p>
<p>" he never felt bound, in his judicial capacity, to
</p>
<p>honour even the resolutions of either house of par-
</p>
<p>liament with the slightest regard." To show how a
</p>
<p>question can be asked and evaded, it is only neces-
</p>
<p>sary to read to you the passage to which the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General alluded in his opening of this case.

</p>
<p>would be farmers, and the gentry lords. Kay,
</p>
<p>he even went so far as to say that if Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>views were fully borne out he might one day become
</p>
<p>liord Ballincollig himself (a laugh). You must
</p>
<p>judge of the good sense of Mr. O'Connell if ever he
</p>
<p>said anything so very absurd ; and you are now
</p>
<p>called upon to take it in proof of a guilty conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and that it was spoken in furtherance of a guilty
</p>
<p>plan entered into for the common purposes the tra-
</p>
<p>versers bad in view ? Will the Solicitor-General now
</p>
<p>tell me that, according to the common law of the
</p>
<p>land, if persons meet with colours flying, and ban-
</p>
<p>ners floating, they therefore constitute an illegal
</p>
<p>assembly ? Was not the Solicitor-General himself a
</p>
<p>law officer of the crown when the Orangemen were
</p>
<p>in the habit of meeting and walking in procession
</p>
<p>with emblematic flags, with music and with arms,
</p>
<p>which, if vexed, they sometimes used, and they were
</p>
<p>tried only for a I'iot ? AVill the learned gentleman
</p>
<p>now say that, according to the common law of this
</p>
<p>country, the Orangemen who have met to comme-
</p>
<p>morate the coming of William the Third to this
</p>
<p>country, because they walked in procession, were
</p>
<p>guilty of an ofience at common law ? He certainly
</p>
<p>will not. Neither were they considered so in parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, for it became necessary to introduce a bill
</p>
<p>drawn up, perhaps, by the learned Solicitor himself,
</p>
<p>and introduced by Lord Stanley to nieet their case,
</p>
<p>and an act was passed accordingly, leaving it open
</p>
<p>to every other body of men to meet together and to
</p>
<p>lise flags, banners, and music. That was a mock
</p>
<p>liberality, indeed, they should have aimed at all or
</p>
<p>at none, but they have no right now to come to a
</p>
<p>jury, and becaiise of a defect or omission in their

<p>own legislation, ask them to declare by their verdict
</p>
<p>that a meeting was illegal at common law. By
</p>
<p>passing an act to meet the case of the Orangemen of
</p>
<p>the North, they had declared that the common law
</p>
<p>of the land was insufiicient for their purpose. The
</p>
<p>passing of that measure was opposed by Mr. Lefroy,
</p>
<p>who now administers justice in another court, who
</p>
<p>maintained the legality of those who walked in pro-
</p>
<p>cession to defend themselves from attack. But what
</p>
<p>was the answer given by Lord Stanley ? He said,
</p>
<p>it was not necessary to celebrate festivals with loaded
</p>
<p>muskets, and exhibiting flags and banners, and em-
</p>
<p>blems to insult their Catholic fellow-countrj'men.
</p>
<p>They refused to extend that law so as to affect meet-
</p>
<p>iiigs like the present, and you are now called upon,
</p>
<p>at the beck of those ministers, to put down those
</p>
<p>meetings. There were two persons in the house that
</p>
<p>Opposed that measure ; one of those persons was one
</p>
<p>of the traversers at the bar, Daniel O'Connell. His
</p>
<p>did enemies were the Orangemen of Ireland ; he
</p>
<p>Alight speak of them as he pleased ; and if he had
</p>
<p>forgotten their virtues, and remembered but their
</p>
<p>vices and faults, he might have given his vote to
</p>
<p>extinguish their rights. But he says distinctly that
</p>
<p>there is no case made out for this measure  and
</p>
<p>that, therefore, though a Catholic, he would sup-
</p>
<p>port the amendment before the house. There was
</p>
<p>one other member who supported the amendment,
</p>
<p>ahd he is, I believe, the second gentleman you are
</p>
<p>called upon to convict, another son of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, and on the same manly and constitutional
</p>
<p>grounds. Will the learned gentlem.in stand up to

<p>iell you that marching, I put it that they marched

<p>'heir civil rights, another body of men combined, I
</p>
<p>contederated, and conspired, to use the terms o: tlie
</p>
<p>indictment, to rescue Ireland from contempt and po-
</p>
<p>verty. That body was the Volunteers of Ireland.
</p>
<p>What was the condition of Ireland at the time they
</p>
<p>were embodied ? The commerce of Ireland was
</p>
<p>prostrated  her trade was put down  her manufac-
</p>
<p>tures were destroyed  she was a country without
</p>
<p>commerce, and had a parliament without freedom.
</p>
<p>They were discontented, and it is well for you to-day
</p>
<p>that they were  and those men, who were not called
</p>
<p>disloyal or disaffected, combined together for one
</p>
<p>common object, of having justice done to their native
</p>
<p>land. All that the genius of Swift, the learning of
</p>
<p>Molyneux, and the patriotism of Lucas failed to ob-
</p>
<p>tainall that was denied to justice was yielded to
</p>
<p>men with arms in their hands. They combined to
</p>
<p>be something more than the mere serfs of England ;
</p>
<p>they were discontented with a law, and they strug-
</p>
<p>gled for its repeal. The Catholic association, having
</p>
<p>learned how concessions were to be obtained, formed
</p>
<p>themselves into a new body in \'Ji)2. In 1806 a new
</p>
<p>association was formed, and in 1810 another, under
</p>
<p>the direction of Mr. Scully. In 1823 the last society
</p>
<p>of that kind was formed, which embraced a large por-
</p>
<p>tion of the Irish people. The aristocracy, the gen-
</p>
<p>try, the priesthood, and the people  became mem-
</p>
<p>bers of it. They had their rules, and the rules of the
</p>
<p>present repeal association are almost fac similes of
</p>
<p>them. They collected their rent  they appointed
</p>
<p>rent-collectors, and they broke no law in all they
</p>
<p>did. That association ceased in 1825 ; but it was
</p>
<p>not by prosecutions for conspiracy. Aggregate
</p>
<p>meetings were held in every part of the kingdom,

</p>
<p>and a simultaneous meeting was held on the 21st of
</p>
<p>January, 1828, at which no less than a million and
</p>
<p>five hundred thousand persons assembled, having
</p>
<p>one common object  they assembled under the sanc-
</p>
<p>tion of the law, and the great crown lawyer of that
</p>
<p>day, the Attorney-General (Mr. Plunket), did not
</p>
<p>prosecute them. In fact, this chain of meetings and
</p>
<p>the others for a similar object, were held under the
</p>
<p>eyes of the executive, and such was the extent to
</p>
<p>which, in regard to newspaper publications, their
</p>
<p>proceedings were promulgated, that eight lnm-
</p>
<p>dred copies of the Register were circulated weekly
</p>
<p>by that association. The Brunswick Clubs sprung
</p>
<p>up, their object being to resist the emancipa-
</p>
<p>tion, and, at length, that confederation was put
</p>
<p>down in 1829. But what was the lesson taught
</p>
<p>the people of this country  that if they were orga-
</p>
<p>nized by peaceful agitation they might be victorious
</p>
<p>almost over the conscience of the Sovereign, the
</p>
<p>wishes of the English people, and the inclination of
</p>
<p>a British parliament ? Thus, you see what has been
</p>
<p>the policy of England  what the method adopted by
</p>
<p>her in her dealings with this country. Like an
</p>
<p>angry and fickle parent, she chastises her without
</p>
<p>cause, and she rewards her the next moment with a
</p>
<p>sugar plumb. If the government had cause to com-
</p>
<p>plain of tliis agitation, why not proceed to deal with
</p>
<p>it according to the spirit of the constitution, by le-
</p>
<p>gislation? It applied an act of the legislature to
</p>
<p>the suppression of delegates from the Catholic asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, the 32d Geo. III., cap. 29. That proved
</p>
<p>that an act of parliament was necessary, in order to
</p>
<p>put down such a combination. What, then, was the

<p>obvious duty of the government with respect to the

<p>rate statement of the population of the country ; in
</p>
<p>another corner we find an accurate statement of its
</p>
<p>geograpliical extent of the country as compared
</p>
<p>with other countries ; there is then a statement of
</p>
<p>how much Ireland supplied towards the maintenance
</p>
<p>of the wars, and the whole concludes by the asser-
</p>
<p>tion of a fact, wJiich, I am sure, no man here will
</p>
<p>dispute  namely, that we have no parliament ; and
</p>
<p>yet this card is given in evidence to prove a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ? Undoubtedly, there are some historical
</p>
<p>allusions in the card, but will it be pretended for a
</p>
<p>moment that it is criminal to allude to historical
</p>
<p>events ? If so, the Scotch people ought to be put
</p>
<p>on trial, and Burns, who wrote some beautiful lines
</p>
<p>on Bannockburn, must henceforward be handed
</p>
<p>down to posterity as a conspirator. But now I
</p>
<p>come to the volunteers' card, and were it not for the
</p>
<p>valuable assistance which, I have no doubt, I will
</p>
<p>receive from your lordships in the task, I would ap-
</p>
<p>proach the interpretation of this card with fear and
</p>
<p>trembhng (laughter). In one corner of it I find
</p>
<p>a likeness (faithful, I am to presume) of a cele-
</p>
<p>brated Irish legislator, who rejoiced in the appella-
</p>
<p>tion of OUam Fodlha (hear, hear). 1 confess with
</p>
<p>shame ray utter incompetency to treat of the merits
</p>
<p>of this gentleman  but my Lord Chief Justice, who
</p>
<p>is deeply read in Irish lore, is conversant, no doubt,
</p>
<p>with his writings, and will understand the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of law which have been propounded by this
</p>
<p>illustrious Solon (laughter). He, gentlemen, is the
</p>
<p>best judge of what then was seditious, unlawful, and
</p>
<p>rebellious, in putting the head of 011am Fodlha on
</p>
<p>the card (laughter). In that case I have to tell
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen, that the judges on the bench are a

<p>party to the conspiracy (laughter). If you look into
</p>
<p>the hall of the courts, a place where you come to seek
</p>
<p>for justice, and where it is to be presumed it may be
</p>
<p>had inside, I say tlie founders of tliis institution have
</p>
<p>had the hardihood to place the head of 011am Fodlha in
</p>
<p>a niche there (laughter). You will give all the value
</p>
<p>of purity of intention to the people who thought
</p>
<p>OUam Fodlha ought to be a model of uprightness
</p>
<p>and justice, whilst you must brand as a conspirator
</p>
<p>the man who puts that name on a card (laughter).
</p>
<p>Here is a name that I confess puzzles me a little, and
</p>
<p>one in reference to which 1 must certainly apply to
</p>
<p>Judge Burton for assistance (laughter). It is the
</p>
<p>name of the gentleman called Dathy (great laugh-
</p>
<p>ter). Did you ever hear of such a name as Dathy
</p>
<p>(renewed laughter) ? Why, the very sound of it is
</p>
<p>conspiracy (laughter). Dathy! But who he was,
</p>
<p>what his opinions or thoughts, how he conducted
</p>
<p>himself, whether in accordance with the law or
</p>
<p>against it, I can't tell (laughter) ; but if there was
</p>
<p>anything particularly wicked in his conduct, how
</p>
<p>putting his name on this card makes the people who
</p>
<p>did so conspirators, I leave for the learned judge to
</p>
<p>explain it to you. All I know about the gentleman
</p>
<p>is, that I am assured by my friend Mr. Moore here
</p>
<p>he was a Pagan, and died at the foot of the Alps
</p>
<p>from a flash of lightning (loud laughter). But the
</p>
<p>defendauts go forth and put two other names on
</p>
<p>their cards, and what names are those? The names
</p>
<p>of Grattan and Flood. Men whose names would go
</p>
<p>down to posterity.  whose memory would be handed
</p>
<p>down from generation to generation as long as Ire-
</p>
<p>land lasted ; but how would those names be handed

<p>down ? Was it as men who 'struck down the mo-

</p>
<p>537
</p>
<p>trhieh the association recommended the total absence
</p>
<p>of all physical force or violence, or breach of the
</p>
<p>laws of man, or ordinances of God.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn then read an address to the "Peo-
</p>
<p>ple of Ireland," which was one of the documents
</p>
<p>proved in evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside continued  I shall now, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, call your attention to two documents. One
</p>
<p>is the letter which you will recollect was proved in
</p>
<p>this case. It is from Mr. Sharman Crawford, and
</p>
<p>is headed  " Repeal and Federalism ;" and I con-
</p>
<p>tend that the fact of Mr. Shannau Crawford, a man
</p>
<p>of his fortune and position in the country, almost
</p>
<p>agreeing in the opinion, that something like a local
</p>
<p>legislature should be obtained,. is an important fact.
</p>
<p>In that letter he sets forth the grievances under
</p>
<p>which he says Ireland laboured, which are, in fact,
</p>
<p>the same Mr. O'Connell has spoken of; and, there-
</p>
<p>fore, the substantial matters of disagreement are,
</p>
<p>that one would have federaUsm, and the other an
</p>
<p>independent parhament. The other document to
</p>
<p>which I have already alluded is the protest of the
</p>
<p>Irish members. It was signed ly thirty- two' mem-
</p>
<p>bers of parliament, and it sets forth the grievances
</p>
<p>of Ireland  the very grievances that Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>Btates justify him in seeking for repeal. That pro-
</p>
<p>test was signed by one of the members for Belfast
</p>
<p>the representative of a wealthy, influential, and im-
</p>
<p>portant constituency, and his opinions have not
</p>
<p>been disavowed or disclaimed by his constituents.
</p>
<p>It was also signed by Mr. Smith O'Brien, a member
</p>
<p>of parliament, the son of a bironet, a Protestant,
</p>
<p>and a gentleman of distinction ; and who since then,
</p>
<p>in a distinct letter, declared that nothing but a

</p>
<p>separate legislation could promote the amelioration
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Was it then sedition in Mr; O'Connell
</p>
<p>to hold the same opinion with the wisest, the most
</p>
<p>just, and most respectable individuals in this country?
</p>
<p>In support of my opinion I jefer you to the'trial of
</p>
<p>Hardy, in page 211, in whicli it was relied on that
</p>
<p>every act done by the persons who were charged
</p>
<p>with, conspiracy was done, written, and pubUshed
</p>
<p>in the face of the world  tlat they could be found
</p>
<p>in every newspaper, in e\ery coffee-room in the
</p>
<p>kingdom ; and so it was with Mr. O'Connell even
</p>
<p>from the beginning of his pubUc life. In January,
</p>
<p>1800, he made a speech in the Royal Exchange, and
</p>
<p>he made that speech publicly  he made-it under the
</p>
<p>surveillance of Major Sirr, a gentleman of consi-
</p>
<p>derable police talent. Yes, he who is now charged
</p>
<p>as a conspirator, made tlat his first speech against
</p>
<p>the union. Forty- four 'ears ago, at a great public
</p>
<p>meeting, he broached opnions for which the charge
</p>
<p>of cohspii-acy is now preferred. In 1800, the cor-
</p>
<p>poration and the parish meetings in Duiilin came
</p>
<p>to the conclusion, that after twelve or fourteen years
</p>
<p>the' union was a fatal measure, and therefore should
</p>
<p>be repealed. The learned gentlemaii then pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to read from thi report of the select com-
</p>
<p>niittee on secrt societies, a description of the
</p>
<p>proceedings of the United Irishmen, in" which se-
</p>
<p>crecy and assassination were recommended as
</p>
<p>expedient- for the canying oiit of their designs.
</p>
<p>The society of United Irishmen was not a debating
</p>
<p>society (they seemed to have a horror of public
</p>
<p>'speaking). Secrecy, it was said in page 67 of the
</p>
<p>report of the select eommittee on secret societies,
</p>
<p>wasexpedient and neeessary,  that was the bond of

<p>jndividaals composing a ministry may be, provided
</p>
<p>the people under their rule are contented, pros-
</p>
<p>perous, and happy. Are our countrymen so ? Alas !
</p>
<p>a large portion are destitute. Pressed down by
</p>
<p>poverty, they look around for the causes. They
</p>
<p>behold a country blest by Providence with the means
</p>
<p>of wealth. They strive with gaunt famine for ex-
</p>
<p>istence in the midst of fields teeming with fertility
</p>
<p>and plenty. The strong man pines for employment
</p>
<p>in his native land for the daily pittance of a sixpence.
</p>
<p>Must he starve in silence ? May he speak in the
</p>
<p>language of complaint, remonstrance, and indigna-
</p>
<p>tion ? If he does, is he seditious ? And if, in the
</p>
<p>agony of his misery, he thinks, though erroneously,
</p>
<p>a native parliament might help him to employment,
</p>
<p>is he criminal to wish for the means of life ? Is he
</p>
<p>seditious to say so ? And if he feels his single voice
</p>
<p>would beimheeded as the idle wind, and unites with
</p>
<p>others, miserable as liimself, to give weight to the

<p>expression of their common wants, is he  are his
</p>
<p>associates conspirators? Is the conspiracy the
</p>
<p>blacker, because no property has been invaded, no
</p>
<p>person injured, no outrage attempted, and that pro-
</p>
<p>found tranquillity has been maintained? These
</p>
<p>people think they have found the secret of their
</p>
<p>misery  the cause of their intolerable woe  the
</p>
<p>want of a resident legislature, and they imagine if
</p>
<p>they could obtain that blessing, employment would
</p>
<p>succeed to compulsory idleness, and food to starva-
</p>
<p>tion. They think, perhaps erroneously, that the
</p>
<p>presence of an aristocracy is a blessing to a country,
</p>
<p>and a resident gentry the source of industry and
</p>
<p>wealth. They conclude, perhaps rashly, it is

<p>not morally right that millions should be drained

<p>annually from the soil of Ireland by those whose
</p>
<p>tastes are too fastidious to permit them to spend one
</p>
<p>hour among the people who labour to supply their
</p>
<p>extravagance or their necessities. They say, by the
</p>
<p>evidence of their senses they know the value of a
</p>
<p>resident peerage and gentry, by the happy results
</p>
<p>which flow from such a residence wherever it exists.
</p>
<p>They blame the union for the loss of their gentry
</p>
<p>and aristocracy, and they see the crying evils of
</p>
<p>absenteeism daily increased  therefore, they object
</p>
<p>to the union. The attractions of a parliament, they
</p>
<p>fondly imagine, would induce them to return  .
</p>
<p>therefore, they demand a repeal of the union. Alas I
</p>
<p>Ireland has little now to induce her gentry to dwell
</p>
<p>in their native land  its rare natural beauties lose

<p>their freshness while compared with the fascinations

<p>Mr. Moore said that his friend Mr. Whiteside

<p>would permit him to postpone the remainder of

<p>his address (as he had not yet concluded all he had

</p>
<p>MR. WHITESIDE RESUMED.
</p>
<p>He said  I shall draw your attention now, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, to the cliarge in this indictment, on the
</p>
<p>subject of the ai-bitratior courts. Tliis single accu-
</p>
<p>sation is spread over a great portion of the indictment,
</p>
<p>and much dwelt upon by my learned friend, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, in his address to you. I appre-
</p>
<p>hend it would astonish jou very much if any of you
</p>
<p>were prevented on the ground that you recom-
</p>
<p>mended one of your brother j urors not to go to law.
</p>
<p>You must recollect the ;hing to be done, and advised
</p>
<p>to be done, and how it is to be done  to see if the
</p>
<p>act itself be legal, and 1" the means adopted for the
</p>
<p>carrying out of the act be legal also. I submit that
</p>
<p>it is both a reUgious and moral duty, if possible, to
</p>
<p>compromise the subjec; matter of litigation between
</p>
<p>two parties, and you vill find it in that book, which
</p>
<p>I am sure is a high autlority in your estimation  the
</p>
<p>Bible. Next, it is a moral duty. In Paley's Moral
</p>

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>have no power, authority, or jurisdiction, except by
</p>
<p>consent of such parties as came before them. That
</p>
<p>was the last rule adopted by the association ; and
</p>
<p>the proposition of Doctor Gray, that any person that
</p>
<p>would not abide by the decision of the arbitrators
</p>
<p>should be expelled the association, was not adopted.
</p>
<p>There is notliing more in this part of the case but
</p>
<p>this a recommendation to the parties to consent to
</p>
<p>arbitration. That consent is the root of all refer-
</p>
<p>ences to arbitration, and the thing being a moral
</p>
<p>thing to do, and the means being legal, I submit
</p>
<p>that this novel, this unprecedented, extraordinary
</p>
<p>ground of accusation cannot be relied upon in the
</p>
<p>present case. It is said you did more  you not only
</p>
<p>induced parties to refer suits to arbitration, but that
</p>
<p>those justices that had been dismissed should be
</p>
<p>selected as arbitrators. That has been most strongly
</p>
<p>pressed by the Attorney-General, and has been over
</p>
<p>and over again urged. I admit frankly that it was
</p>
<p>said by Mr. O'Connell and others that they hoped
</p>
<p>that those persons being dismissed justices residing
</p>
<p>in some parts of the country should be selected or
</p>
<p>appointed to act on behalf of the people ; and they
</p>
<p>hoped the time would come when the people would
</p>
<p>be at liberty to elect their magistrates. It arose
</p>
<p>from a matter merely accidental, and never 'was in-
</p>
<p>tended or contemplated by those who became re-
</p>
<p>pealers. It was long afterwards that the act was
</p>
<p>done which led to the appointment of these ex-jus-
</p>
<p>tices as arbitrators, and it was not the result of a
</p>
<p>common design. It arose from the act of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. They saw that a number of gentlemen of
</p>
<p> high respectability attended these repeal meetings,
</p>
<p>and it is quite plain, from reading the correspon-

</p>
<p>dence of the Lord Chancellor, that he did not con-
</p>
<p>sider they had thereby done an illegal act. In liis
</p>
<p>letter of the 28th of May, 1843, he says that it had
</p>
<p>been his earnest determination not to interfere with
</p>
<p>expression of opinion by any magistrate in respect
</p>
<p>to the repeal of the union, although, from his arrival
</p>
<p>in this country, he felt it to be inconsistent with
</p>
<p>his duty to appoint to the commission of the peace
</p>
<p>any one who was pledged to the support of that
</p>
<p>measure ; but he afterwards assigns as his reason
</p>
<p>for dismissing them, that after the discussions in the
</p>
<p>house of lords, and the declarations made in parlia-
</p>
<p>ment by Sir Robert Peel, in answer to the plain
</p>
<p>and distinct question of Lord Jocelyn, he felt it his
</p>
<p>duty to ask whether they intended to attend any
</p>
<p>more of these meetings, and if so, to dismiss them.
</p>
<p>That letter plainly showed that attending these
</p>
<p>meetings originally was not an illegal act, and his
</p>
<p>-letter was then merely a warning. Gentlemen, it is
</p>
<p>not my duty, consistent with the high respect I en .
</p>
<p>tertain for that distinguished functionary, to enter
</p>
<p>on a discussion of the grounds on which he pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded ; but there were men of high authority ex-
</p>
<p>pressed their opinions upon it, and among others,
</p>
<p>two who had filled the oiiice of Lord Chancellor of
</p>
<p>England. I mean Lord Cottenham and Lord Camp-
</p>
<p>bell, who in the house of lords disputed those grounds,
</p>
<p>and said very plainly that it was unconstitutional to
</p>
<p> dismiss those magistrates. That a justice of the
</p>
<p>; peace had the same right to express and entertain
</p>
<p>his opinion as any other man in the community, and
</p>
<p>that for having so done it was illegal and unconsti-
</p>
<p>tutional to dismiss them. When the members of
</p>
<p>the repeal association saw that such high legal

<p>far set at rest. I have but one remark more to
</p>
<p>make, and that is, that before you hold anything to
</p>
<p>be criminal, merely because it is novel, you will ask,
</p>
<p>and require from the crown to show you some plain,
</p>
<p>dear expression in a book of law constituting the
</p>
<p>criminality of that act. Another short topic was
</p>
<p>adverted to by my learned friend the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General  the Queen's speech  and I shall now ask
</p>
<p>you to attend to what I suggest in regard to it. It
</p>
<p>may have occurred that unseemly language was
</p>
<p>used in relation to that document, but I beg of you
</p>
<p>to bear in mind the distinction which was alwaj'S
</p>
<p>wade between it as not the act of her Majesty but
</p>
<p>that of ministers. Our gracious sovereign is not
</p>
<p>responsible for any one word in that speech. The
</p>
<p>Whig ministry censured the Tory speech, and that
</p>
<p>Tory censured the Whig speech, and I believe it is
</p>
<p>not within the compass of human possibility to
</p>
<p>frame a speech so as to please all parties. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I shall refer you to two authorities, which I
</p>
<p>hope the Attorney-General will not censure me for
</p>
<p>quoting. You may wish to know in what terms two
</p>
<p>stout Conservative newspapers treated the speech of
</p>
<p>her Majesty in July, 1839, on theeducation question.
</p>
<p>I quote from the London Standard, and what is its
</p>
<p>language ? The answer, insulting to the majority
</p>
<p>of the house of lords, the half of the house of com-
</p>
<p>mons, and the whole people  i.n answer not to be
</p>
<p>surpassed in petulance and iiBolent hypocrisy, by
</p>
<p>anything that has proceeded from the throne since
</p>
<p>the expulsion of the Stuarts  is thus, by the vile
</p>
<p>self-artifice of Lord Melbourne, brought home to the
</p>
<p>Queen personally. Is this tile way to insure her
</p>
<p>Majesty the affection and respect of her people?

<p>' Will they love her more for preferring the interests
</p>
<p>of Lord Melbourne to their wishes? Will they
</p>
<p>respect more a princess of twenty years and two
</p>
<p>months, because she is rep-esented as rebuking
</p>
<p>sharply the majority of the lords, the great majority
</p>
<p>of the British members of tJie house of commons,
</p>
<p>the nation, and the church, and associating with that
</p>
<p>rebuke a claim of confidence in her attachment to
</p>
<p>the interests of the church, almost in the words of
</p>
<p>the Popish tyrant, James the Second ? Has the
</p>
<p>Queen no friend to set the truth of these matters
</p>
<p>before her Majesty ? Alas ! we fear she has none !
</p>
<p>An execrable foreign influence interposes between
</p>
<p>her Majesty and her truost and best friend  that
</p>
<p>friend whom nature and experience call upon her to
</p>
<p>trust before all others. We know not what the
</p>
<p>house of lords may thinl it right to do on this an-
</p>
<p>swer. We hope, however, that an acknowledgment
</p>
<p>will be extorted from Lord Melbourne, that the
</p>
<p>answer is liis and not .he Queen's, in any but the
</p>
<p>merely formal sense. 7his is absolutely necessary

</p>
<p>attention to the mild md gentle strictures which
</p>
<p>appeared in another jotrnal of similar politics  the
</p>
<p>Morning Post  about thtt same speech. I purposely
</p>
<p>confine myself to a reference to those newspapers,
</p>
<p>for I am well aware tint they are papers which are
</p>
<p>likely to find favour in the eyes of the counsel for
</p>
<p>the crown ; and I thiik it utterly impossible that
</p>
<p>journals whose political principles are so thoroughly
</p>
<p>orthodox could commit any error on the subject of
</p>
<p>the right of the public to express their opinions
</p>
<p>without reservation, ii reference to the speech of

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>thing wrong in the discipline of the army  some-
</p>
<p>tliing exceedingly oppressive upon the soldiery 
</p>
<p>when a man of good character.  who, up to that
</p>
<p>time, had conducted himself with strict propriety 
</p>
<p>could be guilty of a crime so horrible and atrocious.
</p>
<p>It was the topic of general observation. Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell incidentally, in tlie course of his speeches, made
</p>
<p>some allusion to it ; and a clergyman of the name
</p>
<p>of Power also wrote a letter on the subject, which
</p>
<p>was published in the Pilot. Of that letter I will
</p>
<p>say nothing, for Mr. Power is defended here by
</p>
<p>counsel.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  There is no traverser before the
</p>
<p>court of the name of Power.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Oh, no, my lord, I am aware
</p>
<p>there is not. What I meant to convey was, that
</p>
<p>there is counsel here for Mr. Barrett, who is re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for the publication of tliat letter. That
</p>
<p>letter may, perhaps, be fairly enough adduced in
</p>
<p>evidence against Mi-. Barrett, but I deny that it can
</p>
<p>be adduced in evidence against the other traversers ;
</p>
<p>and what I complain of is, that the invisible gentle-
</p>
<p>man with the scissors should have been so exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly polite as to have introduced it into his indict-
</p>
<p>ment for the purpose, forsooth, of provmg a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against my client ! No specific act is laid
</p>
<p>to Mr. O'Connell's charge, designed for the purpose
</p>
<p>of weaning the soldiery from their allegiance ; and
</p>
<p>the head and front of his offending consists in his
</p>
<p>having expressed it as his opinion, that sergeants
</p>
<p>ought to be more frequently promoted to commis-
</p>
<p>sions. But, gentlemen, were it not that I do not
</p>
<p>wish to weary out your patience, I could quote ex-
</p>
<p>tracts ad infinitum from military works, written by

</p>
<p>officers in the army, in which the same doctrine is
</p>
<p>distinctly propounded. For my part I pass no
</p>
<p>opinion upon the subject, but I cannot see why the
</p>
<p>right of other parties to do so should be disputed.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the Attorney- General has called the
</p>
<p>traversers severely to task for having adopted the
</p>
<p>resolution of the old Volunteers, and for having
</p>
<p>quoted in their speeches the words of some illus-
</p>
<p>trious men, now no more, who expressed it as their
</p>
<p>opinion that in point of constitutional principle, and
</p>
<p>upon constitutional reasoning, the union was null
</p>
<p>and void. He told you what is stated by members
</p>
<p>of parliament against an act before it becomes law
</p>
<p>cannot justify a man in opposing that act of parlia-
</p>
<p>ment after it shall have become the law of the land.
</p>
<p>That is certainly true to a certain extent ; but I
</p>
<p>cannot help thinking that the Attorney-General is
</p>
<p>endeavom"ing to push the principle somewhat too
</p>
<p>far. He finds fault witli us for having quoted the
</p>
<p>words of that distinguished man, Mr. Saurin, but I
</p>
<p>do not think that he had any right to call us to
</p>
<p>task for having done so. Why should not Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell refer to Mr. Saurin' s words ? They are
</p>
<p>public property  they are tlie property of the Irish
</p>
<p>people. The sentiments, honestly and deliberately
</p>
<p>expressed of a member of the legislature, are wor-
</p>
<p>thy of being perused, for we are to suppose that
</p>
<p>they faithfully represent his thoughts on the occa-
</p>
<p>sion, and I do not think that any man is justified in
</p>
<p>placing on record and handing down to posterity
</p>
<p>any opinion of his with a view to prevent a law pa s 
</p>
<p>sing, which opinion he does not consider to be
</p>
<p>founded on truth. But, gentlemen, it is a mon-
</p>
<p>strous thing to impeach Mr. O'Connell at this pe-
</p>

</p>
<p>and observed upon, it -will tie a robbery and not a
</p>
<p>treaty  an act of constraint and violence, and not
</p>
<p>of compact and volition  a conquest, not a union.
</p>
<p>A union upon such principles, and accomplished by
</p>
<p>such means, policy never can require, justice never
</p>
<p>can sanctify, wisdom never can approve, patriotism
</p>
<p>never can reconcile, time never can cement, and
</p>
<p>force never can establish. It might be a union for
</p>
<p>a few days, a few months, perhaps for a few years ;
</p>
<p>but it would be followed by ages of ill blood, gene-
</p>
<p>rations of hostility, centuries of contest, and deso-
</p>
<p>lation and misery, to this island to all eternity. It
</p>
<p>would be a union founded on the violation of public
</p>
<p>faith.  erected on national degradation  equally sub-
</p>
<p>versive of the moral, physical, and political fitness
</p>
<p>of things, and equallj' odious and abominable in the
</p>
<p>sight of God and man." Gentlemen, I will give
</p>
<p>you only the closing words of Grattan on that oc-
</p>
<p>casion. He said  " The question is not now such
</p>
<p>as occupied you of old. Not old Poynings  not
</p>
<p>peculation nor plunder  not an embargo  not a
</p>
<p>Catholic bill  not a reform bill : it is your being ;
</p>
<p>it is more  it is your life to come. Whether you
</p>
<p>win go with the Castle at your head, to the tune of
</p>
<p>Charlemont and the Volunteers, and erase his epi-
</p>
<p>taph, or whether your children shall go to youi-
</p>
<p>graves saying, ' A venal, a military court, attack
</p>
<p>the liberties of the Irish, and here lie the bones of
</p>
<p>the honourable dead who saved their country.'
</p>
<p>Such an epitaph is a nobility wliich the king cannot
</p>
<p>give his slaves  'tis a glory which the crown cannot
</p>
<p>give the king." Gentlemen of -he jury, IMi-. Saurin
</p>
<p>made a speech on that occasion ; and wlien we refer
</p>
<p>to a man's speech, we should tike into account his

<p>character, and the circumstances of the man speak-
</p>
<p>ing. We should see if the man is a rash and fiery
</p>
<p>poUtician, and that his words are not entitled to
</p>
<p>respect and esteem. Was thai man rash and fiery ?
</p>
<p>No, he was remarkable for the solidity of his judg-
</p>
<p>ment, the seriousness of his mind, the gravity of
</p>
<p>his style ; he did not contend :ertainly that the par-
</p>
<p>liament might not be so constituted as not pass a
</p>
<p>bill of union ; but he said yon are not elected by the
</p>
<p>Irish people with the knowledge that you are brought
</p>
<p>here to vote away the libercies of that people. If
</p>
<p>you do so, it is illegal and vjid. Before the Scotch
</p>
<p>union was carried, a notice was given to the people
</p>
<p>that the representatives were to be elected for that
</p>
<p>purpose. Mr. Saurin said  " But I conjure the
</p>
<p>house to consider with the nature of the measure
</p>
<p>itself, and the effect which it may have on the coun-
</p>

</p>
<p>Lord Corry, son of Lord Belvidere, moved the pro-
</p>
<p>test and address to his Majesty. Mr. ' Whiteside

<p>the protest adopted by the anti-union members. The
</p>

</p>
<p>" On this day Lord Corry, with a view to leave On
</p>
<p>record the sentiments of the people of Ireland
</p>
<p>against the union, moved the following address to
</p>
<p>his Majesty, which, as it contains the principal ob-
</p>
<p>jections made by the leaders of the opposition to
</p>
<p>this measure during the course of the session, has
</p>
<p>been thought worthy to insert :,  Were all the ad-
</p>
<p>vantages, which without aiiy foundation they have
</p>
<p>declared that this measure offers, to be its instant
</p>
<p>and immediate consequence, we do not hesitate to
</p>
<p>?ay expressly, that we could not harbour the thought
</p>
<p>of accepting them in exchange for our parliament,
</p>
<p>or that we could, or would, barter our freedom for
</p>
<p>commerce, or our constitution for revenue ; hut the
</p>
<p>offers are mere impositions, and we state with the
</p>
<p>firmest confidence, that in commerce or trade their
</p>
<p>measure confirms no one advantage, nor can it con-
</p>
<p>fer any; for by your Majesty's gracious and pater-
</p>
<p>nal attention to this your ancient realm of Ireland,
</p>
<p>every restriction under which its commerce laboured
</p>
<p>has been removed during your Majesty's auspicious

<p>reign, and we are now as free to trade to all the
</p>
<p>world as Britain is. In manufactures any attempt
</p>
<p>it makes to offer any benefit which we do not now
</p>
<p>enjoy, is vain and delusive ; and wherever it is to
</p>
<p>have effect, that effect will be to our injury. Most
</p>
<p>of the duties on import, which operate as protec-
</p>
<p>tions to our manufactures are, under its provisions,
</p>
<p>either to be removed or reduced immediately ; and
</p>
<p>those which will be reduced are to cease entirely at
</p>
<p>a limited time, though many of our rnanufactures
</p>
<p>owe their existence to the protection of those duties;
</p>
<p>and though it is not in the power of human wisdom
</p>
<p>to foresee any precise time when they may be able
</p>
<p>to thrive without them. Your Majesty's faithful
</p>
<p>commons feel more than an ordinary interest in lay-
</p>
<p>ing this fact before you ; because they have, under
</p>
<p>your Majesty's approbation, raised up and nursed
</p>
<p>many of those manufactures ; and by so doing, iiave
</p>
<p>encouraged much capital to be vested in them, the
</p>
<p>proprietors of which are now to be left unprotected,
</p>
<p>and to be deprived of the parliament on whose faith
</p>
<p>they embarked themselves, their families, and pro-
</p>
<p>perties in the undertaking." ' And again  "But it
</p>
<p>is not only in respect to these delusions held out as
</p>
<p>to trade and revenue that we feel it our duty to lay
</p>
<p>before your Majesty the conduct of your miiiisters
</p>
<p>on this measure; we must state the means by wliich
</p>
<p>they have endeavoured to carry it. Tliat in the
</p>
<p>first instance, admitting the necessity of conforming
</p>
<p>to the sense of the parliament and the people, they
</p>
<p>took the sense of the commons, and found that sense
</p>
<p>to be against it ; that they then affected to appeal
</p>
<p>against the parliament to the people, at the same
</p>
<p>time endeavouring, by their choice of sheriffs, to ob-

</p>
<p>And again  " That whether we rest on this incon-
</p>
<p>tfovertible and self-evident truth, that no parliament
</p>
<p>in another kingdom can have the local information
</p>
<p>or knowledge of the manners, habits, wants, or
</p>
<p>wishes of the nation, which its own parliament na-
</p>
<p> turally possesses, and which is requisite for benefi-
</p>
<p>cial legislation ; nor can be supplied with the neces-
</p>
<p>sary information either as promptly or accurately ;
</p>
<p>or whether we look to the clear proofs of that trutli,
</p>
<p>wliich the progress of this measure has afforded, by
</p>
<p>our mijiisters having called to their assistance, in
</p>
<p>London, the great oflScers of this kingdom, most
</p>
<p>likely, from their station, to give full information
</p>
<p>for framing their measure ; and though all their ta-
</p>
<p>lents, and all their own information, and what they
</p>
<p>obtained by letters while it was pending, -were em-
</p>
<p>ployed for months there, yet, when they brought it
</p>
<p>back, a few hours' or rather a few minutes' inquiry
</p>
<p>on the spot, in Dublin, forced them to alter their
</p>
<p>project in very many articles, complete and perfect
</p>
<p>as they thought it. We have strong additional rea-
</p>
<p>son to tell and to represent the manifest and irre-
</p>
<p>parable injuries which this kingdom must sustain by
</p>
<p>the want of a resident parliament, and the impossi-
</p>
<p>bility of legislation being carried on for it as it ought
</p>
<p>to be. Therefore, inasmuch as the measure of an
</p>
<p>union is an unnecessary innovation  and innova-
</p>
<p>tions, at all times hazardous, are rendered peculiarly
</p>
<p>so now by the awful situation of the times : inas-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Hartly, 'vras of opinion that the wliole system of the
</p>
<p>franchise was corrupt, and that every man who had
</p>
<p>not committed a crime ought to hare a vote ; and
</p>
<p>that there ouglit to be annual parliaments, vote by
</p>
<p>ballot, &c., all which was very well for a Duke.
</p>
<p>And in his letter to Colonel Sharman he (the Duke
</p>
<p>of Richmond) states that he is of opinion that the two
</p>
<p>nations should have but one parliament, provided the
</p>
<p>Sovereign of England shouldreside a reasonable time
</p>
<p>in this country, and hold her imperial parliament in
</p>
<p>it, which he said her Majesty could do with a scrape
</p>
<p>of her pen  and, gentlemen, I hope she may. It is
</p>
<p>a positive insult to the understanding of any man to
</p>
<p>say that such a state of things would not be positive
</p>
<p>benefit to the country, improve her trade, her manu-
</p>
<p>factures and her resources. Even our own profes-
</p>
<p>sion would be benefited by it ; for the residence of
</p>
<p>her most gracious Majesty in this country would be
</p>
<p>no bar to her loyal subjects to go to law (laughter).
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General adopted the Socratic doctrine
</p>
<p>in his argument with us : he put questions to us.
</p>
<p>Now I am not to be held accountable for the doc-
</p>
<p>trines propounded by others who have spoken be-
</p>
<p>fore me. But it can be said, as was alleged, that it
</p>
<p>is revolutionary to state that every town possessing
</p>
<p>10,000 inhabitants should have a representative?
</p>
<p>Why, that is but the principle of the reform bill.
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell also says that every man who marries
</p>
<p>shall have a vote. I think there can be no objec-
</p>
<p>tion on that score  aud that the conspiracy on that
</p>
<p>ground may be abandoned ; and certainly such a
</p>
<p>question could not be submitted to a more favour-
</p>
<p>able jury, for you are all married (laughter). Has

<p>from her throne  the house of peers to be abolished
</p>
<p> and the house of commons extinguished ? No.
</p>
<p>What then has he done ? He has been guilty of the
</p>
<p>monstrous proceeding of extending the royal prero-
</p>
<p>gative ? The Attorney-General, the legal champion
</p>
<p>of the crown, charges it as a crime against Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell that he said the Queen has a larger, wider,
</p>
<p>and more extended prerogative than her Majesty
</p>
<p>possesses. Where is the authority in which it is
</p>
<p>laid down that the man who propounded such a pro-
</p>
<p>position is to be charged as a conspirator. What
</p>
<p>authority |is there for saying that Mr. Duffy, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele, or any one else, is to be charged with con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, because when they heard such a proposi-
</p>
<p>tion they did not say to the person propounding it,
</p>
<p>cite us some authority ; cite us your case. Suppose
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, instead of saying that parliament
</p>
<p>should be reformed  that a parliament should be
</p>
<p>given to Ireland  said, sir, I am of opinion that
</p>
<p>parliament is a humbug  a nuisance ; that her
</p>
<p>Alajesty has a perfect right to rule, independent of
</p>
<p>either house of parliament. Why, what would be
</p>
<p>the consequence ? I cite a case in point. A cele-
</p>
<p>brated writer in England wrote a book in which he
</p>
<p>said that the house of commons might be dispensed
</p>
<p>with. That was voted to be a scandalous and sedi-
</p>
<p>tious libel by the house, and the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>of the day was directed to prosecute the writer. He
</p>
<p>was accordingly prosecuted, and the case is to be
</p>
<p>found in Peake's cases in the King's Bench. It is
</p>
<p>called the liing v. Reeves. Lord Kenyon there laid

<p>MR. WHITESIDE'S ARGUMENT FOR THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>347
</p>
<p>Mr. Butt, who made a most able, argumentative,
</p>
<p>and learned discourse against Mr. O'Connell in that
</p>
<p>debate.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  I don't think you can cite tliat.
</p>
<p>Mr. Wluteside  Then I can state the substance
</p>
<p>of it. Mr. O'Connell said, that as the prerogative
</p>
<p>of the crown in the issuing of writs was putting an
</p>
<p>extreme case, because he knew not any instance,
</p>
<p>where the people were unanimous, that parliament
</p>
<p>had ever refused to grant their legitimate request ;
</p>
<p>and, therefore, he exhorted the corporation to peti-
</p>
<p>tion  which they did  and the people of Ireland to
</p>
<p>petition ; and this led to the mass of petitions that
</p>
<p>have been prepared. And I contend that all these
</p>
<p>things go to prove that his object was to make an
</p>
<p>impression on parliament. If he looked for the
</p>
<p>crown to exercise its prerogative, the meetings and
</p>
<p>the petitions would be useless, so that all the acts
</p>
<p>prove that he looked for relief from parliament, and
</p>
<p>not from the prerogative of the crown. There are
</p>
<p>two general considerations that I shall advert to on
</p>
<p>the subject matter of this case ; that is, whether the
</p>
<p>general conduct pirrsued by the defendants showed
</p>
<p>they were governed by motives that actuate men
</p>
<p>engaged in a conspiracy, and whether the general
</p>
<p>conduct pursued by the government showed that the
</p>
<p>government believed they were engaged in a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. How did the defendants act ? Everything
</p>
<p>they did, everytliing they wrote, everything they
</p>
<p>spoke was before the public ; every morning their
</p>
<p>speeches appeared in the frigid Saunders, and at night
</p>
<p>in the fiery Pilot, and they sent up to the govern-
</p>
<p>ment proof of their guilt, and evidence for their con-
</p>
<p>viction. Tliey spoke openly and iu day light, those

<p>dark projects, those treasonable designs, these hid-
</p>
<p>den contrivances ; their rules are given to the

<p>public  they employed the pi-inter of the crown to
</p>
<p>print them, and they declared their object to be the
</p>
<p>peaceable organisation of the people  to concentrate
</p>
<p>popular opinion, and carry out the objects they had
</p>
<p>in view, and that was a legitimate and proper ob-
</p>
<p>ject. What was the conduct of the government?
</p>
<p>Did that government show they believed that there
</p>
<p>existed in this country a conspiracy, beginning in
</p>
<p>March, and continuing up to October? If those
</p>
<p>publications were seditious, and proof of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; if they were incentives to rebellion, and
</p>
<p>calculated to poison the public mind, and infect
</p>
<p>popular feeUng in this country, for two whole years
</p>
<p>the court sat in which the Attorney-General had the
</p>
<p>right from his high station, to do what he thought
</p>
<p>proper in the defence of the law and constitution on
</p>
<p>any of those publications that are now asserted to be
</p>
<p>extraordinary seditious, and why have they not been
</p>
<p>prosecuted by liim ? And I retort on him the argu-
</p>
<p>ment he used, that if it were mischievous in those de-
</p>
<p>fendants, or any of them, to spread poison through
</p>
<p>the land, it is more mischievous in the champion of
</p>
<p>the government, the sentinel of the state, not at
</p>
<p>once to come forward and stop the mischief when it
</p>
<p>might be stopped. Parliament sat until the month
</p>
<p>of August, and I call your attention to the discus-
</p>
<p>sion to wliich the Attorney-General referred  the
</p>
<p>question put by Lord Jocclyn to the minister, and
</p>
<p>the pvasive answer given by that minister. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, the attention of the government was also
</p>
<p>drawn most forcibly to the condition of Ireland in

</p>
<p>Pidgeon-house bristled with cannon, and looked
</p>
<p>awful, and the police skirmished, and the Com-
</p>
<p>mander-in-Chief  what did he do? It is stated
</p>
<p>that Sir Edward Blakeney, at one o'clock, rode

<p>down to inspect the troops  approved of what was
</p>
<p>done  rode home and dined ! And if he does not
</p>
<p>get a peerage for the happy deeds he did that day,
</p>
<p>justice will not be done to Ireland (laughter).
</p>
<p>Such a triumph was never achieved since the re-
</p>
<p>nowned days of Irish history, when Brian Boroihme
</p>
<p>buckled on his mighty sword and smote the Danes
</p>
<p>(laughter). To be serious  was that a wise, con-
</p>
<p>sistent, judicious course of policy to make the law
</p>
<p>understood, respected, and obeyed ? Was it not
</p>
<p>the last policy that should be resorted to for the
</p>
<p>purpose of governing so mercurial a people as the
</p>
<p>Irish ? The meeting at Donnybrook was not for-
</p>
<p>bidden  the Clontarf meeting was to be put down
</p>
<p>by the bayonet. Will constitutional knowledge be
</p>
<p>much edified by the body of that most interesting
</p>
<p>document  that learned and great performance, the
</p>
<p>proclamation, which it fulminated at the very last
</p>
<p>moment, when the meeting is on the point of being
</p>
<p>held, although other meetings of the same charac-
</p>
<p>ter and nature have been endured by that same go-
</p>
<p>vernment ? Do the Irish laws vary with the season,
</p>
<p>and is that law in June that is not law in October ?
</p>
<p>For the Attorney-General said the meeting at Don-
</p>
<p>nybrook was the type of all the other meetings that
</p>
<p>were held ; and I put it to your own unbiassed na-
</p>
<p>ture if it were  if the government saw the men that
</p>
<p>went to that meeting passing by the Castle-gate,

<p>and knew it was held, and were aware of it  they
</p>
<p>read the speeches.  they had their reporters there,
</p>
<p>and knew everytliing that passed, why not tlien
</p>
<p>put down those meetings ? Heated, inflamed, they
</p>
<p>see an enthusiastic people in pursuit of a darling
</p>
<p>object. Which are the most blameable  the people
</p>
<p>for holding those meetings that they did not see
</p>
<p>denounced or put down by the law  or the mi-
</p>
<p>nistry that stood by and witnessed the folly and
</p>
<p>knew of the madness that allowed the miscliief
</p>
<p>to prevail and spread over the country, until
</p>
<p>it was to burst forth like a fiery volcano, and
</p>
<p>sweep the country in a torrent of devastation?
</p>
<p>Did the conduct of the government prove that its
</p>
<p>members believed in the existence of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>here alleged ? There are two parties on trial  the
</p>
<p>government and the accused. I repeat my question,
</p>
<p>did the conduct of the government prove a belief ex-
</p>
<p>isting in the minds of its members that there was in
</p>
<p>this country, for nearly a year past, not merely in-
</p>
<p>temperate speeches made, but a conspiracy such as
</p>
<p>is now pretended ? And did the acts of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment prove they considered tlie notorious facts in
</p>
<p>evidence established its existence ? Is there not
</p>
<p>something exquisitely absurd in the whole proceed-
</p>
<p>ing ? The assertion of the Attorney-General is,
</p>
<p>that a terrible conspiracy has long existed to rend
</p>
<p>society asunder and subvert our vast political sys-
</p>
<p>tem. The proofs of this giant conspiracy are, say
</p>
<p>they, many and clear  monster meetings have been
</p>
<p>held to carrj' out their horrid project, and masses of

<p>excited people called together to be stimulated by

<p>the maddening eloquence of the chief conspirator.

<p>of these things did the minister or his legal advisers
</p>
<p>do, and yet they now tell you no one of these meet-
</p>
<p>ings was more criminal than another; they were
</p>
<p>each illegal, and all proofs of the wicked conspiracy
</p>
<p>successively illegal, at all times illegal. They afforded
</p>
<p>ftartling proofs of this deadly combination. Yet
</p>
<p>they were not proclaimed, nor put down, nor dis-
</p>
<p>persed. Was the mental vision of the crown lawyers
</p>
<p>ohscured ?  was their eyes less eagerly bent on the
</p>
<p>pages of Hawkins and Hale? Was the Attorney-
</p>
<p>Qeneral less decided last March than he is now?
</p>
<p>Was Mr. Solicitor-General less zealous for the go-
</p>

</p>
<p>4uty was to have advised with firmness, and to have
</p>
<p>^ted with decision, if they all deemed these overt
</p>
<p>acts, as they are called, to have been criminal and

<p>dangerous. Perhaps it might not have been expect-

<p>to bring to light the guilty practices of a dark
</p>
<p>conspiracy, I could understand it. But all that was
</p>
<p>done or spoken was in presence of thousands  the
</p>
<p>whole world saw and knew what was done, spoken,
</p>
<p>and written by the associates of this black con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Gentlemen, the lawyers were right  the
</p>
<p>government then was right there was no con-
</p>
<p>spiracy  there is no conspiracy ; but to acquit the
</p>
<p>government of blame, you must acquit my client.
</p>
<p>The learned counsel then remarked  ^having thus
</p>
<p>viewed the case generally, he would now apply
</p>
<p>himself to the case of his client, Mr. Duffy.
</p>
<p>, Mr. Duffy is the proprietor of a weekly jour-
</p>
<p>nal, and is prosecuted here for no private
</p>
<p>calumny; for no slander on private virtue, inte-
</p>
<p>grity, or honour. He has not invaded the peace of
</p>
<p>families, or sought to gain a base notoriety by
</p>
<p>blackening the reputation of those from whom he
</p>
<p>differed. He is accused here to-day for the terms
</p>
<p>in which he has advocated a great public question ;
</p>
<p>the style in which he has treated a vast political
</p>
<p>subject. That he had a right to advocate and dis-
</p>
<p>cuss his own view of the repeal of the union, cannot
</p>
<p>be denied ; he might do so ardently, boldly, vehe-
</p>
<p>mently. Keflect on the position in which such a
</p>
<p>writer is placed. He is, as the law stands, encom-
</p>
<p>passed with quite enough of difficulty and of danger;
</p>
<p>forced from the necessity of his profession, to en-
</p>
<p>gage from d.ay to day in the discussion of angry
</p>
<p>topics, on which public feeling is inflamed ; forced
</p>
<p>to report and notice what is passing before his eyes,
</p>
<p>else liis paper would not be a newspaper ; and
</p>
<p>obliged to comment upon what is passing, promptly,
</p>
<p>and without reserve. If he is deficient in spirit the

<p>Duffy .igree that Mr. O'Connell should so speak as
</p>
<p>he has spoken ? According to the definition relied
</p>
<p>on by the counsel for the crown, if one man does
</p>
<p>one part of an act, and another person the remain-
</p>
<p>ing portion, there is proof of conspiracy  then does
</p>
<p>that definition apply to tliis case ? The Attoniey-
</p>
<p>General proposes to establish the crime of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, by picking out three or four articles, pub-
</p>
<p>lished at difierent periods, and suggested by passing
</p>
<p>events, culled from the publications in a weekly
</p>
<p>newspaper, extending over a period of nine months,
</p>
<p>and read to the court as being calculated to preju-
</p>
<p>dice the minds of the people against the government
</p>
<p>of England ; and, observe, that all the intervening
</p>
<p>quotations which might qualify or explain them, are
</p>
<p>passed over, although the learned gentleman fer-
</p>
<p>retted out everything else that could serve his pur-
</p>
<p>poses, whether in large type or in small. The song
</p>
<p>on which tliey rely is entitled " The Memory of the
</p>
<p>Dead," and was published in the Nation on the 1 st
</p>
<p>of April, 1843. A very proper day for the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of that which is now selected by the crown as
</p>
<p>evidence of a conspiracy. And suppose it was, in
</p>
<p>the words of the indictment, " an incentive to re-
</p>
<p>bellion," wliy was not the publisher of that seditious
</p>
<p>song at once brought into court and dealt with for
</p>
<p>it ? But nothing is done until it is forgotten, and at
</p>
<p>the eve of eight months a song printed in the Nation
</p>
<p>is stuffed into the indictment. But what is most un-
</p>
<p>accountable with respect to its appearance there is,
</p>
<p>that there is no averment whatever respecting that
</p>
<p>Bong, except tliat Mr. Dufly published it. It does not
</p>
<p>tell you what it relates to. What '98 does it refer to?
</p>
<p>or how does he connect it with the subject matter of

</p>
<p>this conspiracy ? There is not a word of prefatory
</p>
<p>matter to explain what it refers to. Why, then, I
</p>
<p>again ask, is a criminal intent to be fastened upon
</p>
<p>any man without even the form of an averment to
</p>
<p>give an application to what he writes or publishes ?
</p>
<p>Are you to visit this act of Mr. Duffy's on Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, or to presume that it was published in
</p>
<p>pursuance of a common plan between the traversers?
</p>
<p>That song was written by some clever young man,
</p>
<p>and I took the liberty of reading to you another
</p>
<p>song pubUshed in the same paper on the same day,
</p>
<p>and which it was certainly as agreeable to hear as
</p>
<p>many of Mr. Attorney-General's statements. These
</p>
<p>very sweet agreeable verses were read from the very
</p>
<p>same paper. Are you to be asked to believe that
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Steele knew beforehand
</p>
<p>that some young men, perhaps within the walls of
</p>
<p>Trinity College, animated with that poetic fire
</p>
<p>which illumined his imaginative soul, would write
</p>
<p>that song and send it to the compositor of the
</p>
<p>Nation to fill up a corner in his paper ? Are you to
</p>
<p>believe that all this was done in pm-suance of a
</p>
<p>common object, and in furtherance of a conspiracy?
</p>
<p>Is it come to this, that the government of England
</p>
<p>is not safe ; that the constitution of England is in
</p>
<p>danger, because some young men, gifted as the
</p>
<p>writer of that song unquestionably was, adverted,
</p>
<p>in poetic language, to the mistaken views of men
</p>
<p>who lived in former days, or will any twelve honest,
</p>
<p>or inteUigent, or experienced men, be asked to find
</p>
<p>a verdict ou such grounds ? Gentlemen, it is not
</p>
<p>fair  it is not chivalrous  it is not generous thus to

<p>Go flesh every s^^ord to the hilt :
</p>
<p>On our side is Virtue and Erin ;
</p>
<p>On theirs is the Saxon and Guilt.
</p>
<p>Yes, gentlemen, the author of the " Adventures of
</p>
<p>an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion," and
</p>
<p>of the " Memoirs of Lord Edward Fitzgerald," was
</p>
<p>punished. But how was he punished ? He was
</p>
<p>punished by a pension from the English government
</p>
<p> ^yes, Moore was punished with a pension for his
</p>
<p>sedition ; and you, gentlemen of the jury, are now
</p>
<p>solicited to bring a verdict of "guilty" against the
</p>
<p>writer of this song, and to declare your conviction
</p>
<p>that the em.anation of a mind, young, ardent, poeti-
</p>
<p>tal, and imaginative, though mistaken, was written
</p>
<p>in fm'therance of a common plan and design of the
</p>
<p>most infamous nature ! However ardent the youth
</p>
<p>of Ireland may be, it should never be forgotten of
</p>
<p>them that they never forgot their loyalty to their
</p>
<p>sovereign, even when, in 1715 and 1745, the best
</p>
<p>blood of England and of Scotland bedewed the
</p>
<p>scaffold, in consequence of the mad, and well-nigh
</p>
<p>successful attempt to dislodge the present royal
</p>
<p>family from the throne of these coimtries, the Irish
</p>
<p>were faithful even to the death. Are not the fi-ee
</p>
<p>subjects of a free state to be permitted to raise their
</p>
<p>voices in constitutional protestations and remon-
</p>
<p>strance, when they think tliat their interests are
</p>
<p>endangered or injured? Scott, the most cautious
</p>
<p>of writers, was once called upon to decide between
</p>
<p>his attachment to his party and his love of Scotland.

</p>
<p>vitally concerned  a bill in reference to the joint
</p>
<p>stock banks of Scotland. The Scotch thought that
</p>
<p>they would be injured by the contemplated bill ;
</p>
<p>and Sir Walter Scott, fired with indignation at the
</p>
<p>idea that the act should be introduced without con-
</p>
<p>sulting the wishes and feelings of his countr^'men,
</p>
<p>wrote, under the signature of " Malachi Mala-
</p>
<p>grouther" a series of letters, which excited such a
</p>
<p>flame of indignation in the country, from north to
</p>
<p>south, from east to west, that tlie minister of the
</p>
<p>crown was obliged to fly away with liis obnoxious
</p>
<p>bill under his arm, just as the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>would be forced to fly off with liis monster indict-
</p>
<p>menton his slioulder, for it would not fit under any
</p>
<p>man's arm (laughter). But hear how Sir Walter
</p>
<p>expressed his mdignation. [The learned counsel here
</p>
<p>read an extract from page 320 of " Malachi Mala-
</p>
<p>grouther's" letters.] The British minister failed, for
</p>
<p>the Scotch said, " we must get our joint stock banks"
</p>
<p> aye, and they did succeed in getting them ; and
</p>
<p>are we not a country as good as Scotland, that
</p>
<p>succeeded in wringing from the British minister
</p>
<p>their rights upon a great mercantile question ? Was
</p>
<p>that to be done in a cold and servile manner ? Do
</p>
<p>you think Scott did it in that cold and mawkish
</p>
<p>manner, and said, as we lawyers say, " ah ! I re-
</p>
<p>spectfully submit?" (laughter). No, he had to
</p>
<p>excite a national spirit (laughter)  and, therefore,
</p>
<p>he went boldly about the task, and Sir Walter Scott
</p>
<p>succeeded in making his country  which contained
</p>
<p>about one quarter of the number of inhabitants that
</p>
<p>Ireland does  he succeeded, I say, in making her

<p>this to be brought up in judgment against the de-
</p>
<p>fendant ? I ask any man of you here has he not
</p>
<p>read worse articles in the English papers, calculated
</p>
<p>to irritate the people of England, and inflame their
</p>
<p>minds, none of which were prosecuted, but passed by
</p>
<p>and were forgotten ? The advertisement about the
</p>
<p>Clontarf meeting was not what it should be, but was
</p>
<p>it not, when observed by Mr. O'Connell, at once
</p>
<p>withdrawn ? I have shown you that the true object
</p>
<p>of that document in the Nation was, that there should
</p>
<p>be a grand procession to Clontarf. At the request
</p>
<p>of some Protestant clergymen it is given up, as it
</p>
<p>was the sabbath-day, and the time of divine service,
</p>
<p>and even the streets were avoided in which places of
</p>
<p>worship were. I rely on this to show that no offence
</p>
<p>was offered ; but as they had proceeded in a proces-
</p>
<p>sion to Donnybrook, they considered that they might
</p>
<p>do so to Clontarf. I admit that strong language has
</p>
<p>been used, and I regret it. The term " Saxon" has
</p>
<p>been applied to EngUshmen. Mr. O'Connell has
</p>
<p>entirely renounced it at the request of an English
</p>
<p>gentleman  I believe he borrowed it from Moore.
</p>
<p>Moore was wrong to have used it. Yet, probably,
</p>
<p>when these trials are over, if I called upon the
</p>
<p>learned gentleman (pointing to the Solicitor-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral) I would find " Moore's Melodies" and "The
</p>
<p>Irish Gentleman in search of a Keligion" in his
</p>
<p>study ; yet, perhaps, if he knew who knocked at
</p>
<p>the door, he would, like the lady in the play, thrust
</p>
<p>one into a drawer, put the other under the sofa, and
</p>
<p>place " The Whole Duty of Man" on the table

<p>(loud laughter). As to the language made use of in

<p>ference to the English people, it is impossible for me

<p>to defend expressions the use of which my heart
</p>
<p>condemns. I believe the English to be a great, vir-
</p>
<p>tuous, free, magnanimous people ; and the world
</p>
<p>has seen the proofs of their wealth and spirit. It is,
</p>
<p>however, to be regretted that the practical good
</p>
<p>sense which pre-eminently marks their character
</p>
<p>did not induce them in past times to look narrowly
</p>
<p>into the condition of this country, and to do that
</p>
<p>justice to Ireland which the governments of England
</p>
<p>and the monopolists by whom they were surrounded
</p>
<p>and controlled, refused to do. Perhaps something
</p>
<p>may be ascribed to prejudice ; more to the narrow
</p>
<p>views entertained on questions of political science,
</p>
<p>and of trade and commerce, by most men at the pe-
</p>
<p>riod referred to ; and something more to the repre-
</p>
<p>hensible ignorance of the circumstances and feel-
</p>
<p>ings of the Irish people, which prevailed even
</p>
<p>amongst educated EngUshmen till a later and hap-
</p>
<p>pier era. These, combined with other causes,
</p>
<p>spoiled the happiness and checked the prosperity of
</p>
<p>Ireland ; but that EngUshmen take deUght in cru-
</p>
<p>elty or injustice, would not be believed in the most
</p>
<p>barbarous cUraes, and ought not to be believed, nor
</p>
<p>to be asserted here. Gentlemen, respecting the

<p>men, and the former scenes, more dreadful still,

<p>institutions. I prefer the system undci- wliich \vc

<p>live ; but I am sliocked, in contemplating the absurd
</p>
<p>caricatures of America drawn b.v the popular writers
</p>
<p>of the day, who depr.ave the public taste, and mock
</p>
<p>its judgment. Considering what America is, and
</p>
<p>what slie was, I am tempted to exclaim with the
</p>
<p>Koniau llistorian  ' ' Civitas iacredibils memoratu esty
</p>
<p>adepta liberiaii, quantum brevi ci-pverit." A political
</p>
<p>writer may corrupt the public taste, deprave the
</p>
<p>morals of society, and lavish praises on the character
</p>
<p>of the eighth Henry, the profligate Charles, or the
</p>
<p>bigot James, and may hold out as examples of vir-
</p>
<p>tue a Domitian, or a Nero, and he is safe. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General will never prosecute such oiTences
</p>
<p>against good taste or truth ; but if the same writer
</p>
<p>ventures to celebrate the benefactors of mankind,
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General will prosecute the autlior as
</p>
<p>guilty of sedition against the state. The wliole case
</p>
<p>was now before you, aud was emphatically for your
</p>
<p>decision. You have seen the many instances wliere
</p>
<p>the crime of conspiracy was attempted to be fastened

<p>on Englishmen, in which Englisli juries have refused
</p>
<p>to convict. In that terrible book containing the state

<p>trials of Engl.and, where the real history of that
</p>
<p>country is written, there are m.auy instances of truth
</p>
<p>stifled, justice scoffed, and innocence struck down.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there .are memorable examples

<p>of victims rescued from oppression, by the honesty

<p>of conspiracy, for asserting tlie rights of English-
</p>
<p>men, a jury delivered a verdict of acquittal, and
</p>
<p>the shouts of joy with which it was received pro-
</p>
<p>claimed their freedom. Even in the days of Crom-
</p>
<p>well, after he had waded tlirough slaughter to a
</p>
<p>throue, and under the sacred names of liberty and
</p>
<p>religion trampled upon both, the tyrant found the
</p>
<p>virtue of a jury to be beyond his power. The
</p>
<p>forms of justice he dai'cd not iibolislx wliile an
</p>
<p>Englishman lived, aud we have it upon record that
</p>
<p>when, in tlie plenitude of his power, he prose-
</p>
<p>cuted for a libel upon himself, there were twelve
</p>
<p>honest men to be found who had the courage to
</p>
<p>pronounce a verdict of not guilty ; thus proving
</p>
<p>that the unconquerable love of liberty still sur-
</p>
<p>vived in tlie hearts of Englishmen. I quote the words
</p>
<p>of a patriot lawyer, who, in reference to that im-
</p>
<p>mortal precedent, exclaimed  " Wlicn all seemed
</p>
<p>lost, the unconquertible spirit of English liberty sur-
</p>
<p>vived in the hearts of English jurors." I will s.ay
</p>
<p>that the true object of this unprecedented prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion is, to stifle the discussion of a great public ques-
</p>
<p>tion. Viewed in this light, all otlier considerations
</p>
<p>sink into insignificance ; its importance becomes

<p>your side whenever danger was to be faced or honour

<p>won. The scorching sun of the east, and the pesti-
</p>
<p>lence of the west we have endured to spread your
</p>
<p>commerce  to extend your empire  to uphold your
</p>
<p>glory. The bones of our couutrymen whitened the
</p>
<p>fields of Portugal, of Spain, of France. Fighting
</p>
<p>your battles they fell.  in a nobler cause thej' could
</p>
<p>not. We have helped to gather your imperishable
</p>
<p>laurels  we have helped to win your immortal tri-
</p>
<p>umphs. Now, in time of peace, we ask you to re-
</p>
<p>store that parliament you planted here with your
</p>
<p>laws and language, uprooted in a dismal period of

<p>our history, in the moment of our terror, our divi-

</p>
<p>circumstances are utterly iucompatible with the
</p>
<p>Bupposition of the prisoner's innocence. The utmost
</p>
<p>caution is therefore necessary to be exercised in esti-
</p>
<p>mating the weight and effect of circumstantial evi-
</p>
<p>dence, and if juries imperatively require the safe-
</p>
<p>guard of this caution where the evidence is all on
</p>
<p>the one side, how much more indispensable is it in
</p>
<p>the present case where many of the facts and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances have a tendency to prove the innocence
</p>
<p>of the accused ? It is my duty, on behalf of Mi-.
</p>
<p>Barrett, to establish that innocence ; to argue from
</p>
<p>what has been established in evidence, and to de-
</p>
<p>monstrate to your satisfaction that the facts and
</p>
<p>circumstances "do not bear out the allegations in the
</p>
<p>indictment. [The learned gentleman here read
</p>
<p>from the indictment the passage in which the intent
</p>
<p>is charged against the traversers, and proceeded] 
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that is the intent charged, and it is al-
</p>
<p>leged that in pursuance and in order to carry out
</p>
<p>that intent the parties did certain acts, which I shall
</p>
<p>also describe in the terms of the document itself.
</p>
<p>[The learned gentleman read the passage alleging the
</p>
<p>conspiracy.] In these terms the intent and the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to carry it out are stated, and the indictment
</p>
<p>proceeds to enumerate several overt acts, such as
</p>
<p>that the parties assembled in this and that place, with
</p>
<p>thousands of other persons  that they made speeches ;
</p>
<p>and the indictment concludes with charging three
</p>
<p>newspapers, the Pilot, the i\^ation, and the Fieevian,
</p>
<p>with publisliing those speeches. Now, gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, divest the indictment of its technical jar-
</p>
<p>gon, ponder the weight, and scrutinise the severity
</p>
<p>of its imputations ; consider the number of the cri-
</p>

<p>rectly accuse, and you will, I am sure, agree with
</p>
<p>me that it is not one which ought to have been
</p>
<p>lightly preferred, and that the evidence to support
</p>
<p>it should have been in its simplicity, cogency, and
</p>
<p>force, proportionate to the magnitude of the cause.
</p>
<p>Is the evidence you have heard simple, cogent, and
</p>
<p>convincing? No; it is confused, involved, and in-
</p>
<p>conclusive. It is a medley of documents and
</p>
<p>speeches, and acts not grouped in any order, but
</p>
<p>irregularly flung together to support this baseless
</p>
<p>fabric of a conspiracy. As if to make confusion
</p>
<p>more confounded, the MuUaghmast meeting, the
</p>
<p>latest in point of time, was selected as the first for
</p>
<p>proof. Tliis was, I suppose, to let in light on the
</p>
<p>case (laughter) ; but, gentlemen, it is ray intention
</p>
<p>to throw light on the case, for I shall begin at the
</p>
<p>beginning, and go through the proofs respecting
</p>
<p>each meeting as they occurred, a course the more
</p>
<p>necessary to pursue and to insist upon at this stage
</p>
<p>of the proceedings, inasmuch as the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General in his opening statement read those parts
</p>
<p>of the speeches which he supposed would have an
</p>
<p>effect hostile to the case of the traversers. I will
</p>
<p>read for j'ou those parts of the same speeches which
</p>
<p>seem to me favourable to them, and I am convinced,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, that you will take notes of those pas-
</p>
<p>sages with the same honest assiduity which I have
</p>
<p>observed you to exercise previously during the
</p>
<p>opening statement of the Attorney- General. The
</p>
<p>first of the meetings, in order of time, brought under
</p>
<p>your consideration, was that held in MuUingar, and
</p>
<p>I confidently appeal to the notes of the learned
</p>
<p>judges whether there is any evidence whatever of
</p>
<p>the circumstances attendant on that meeting ? Was

<p>what it was at the present time  the people would

<p>be able to purchase a large quantity of the beef and
</p>
<p>mutton produced in the country  the labourer and
</p>
<p>the artizan would have constant employment and

<p>good wages  sectarian prejudices and animosities
</p>
<p>would be totally forgotten in the universal pros-
</p>
<p>perity and happiness that would exist throughout
</p>
<p>the country, and Ireland would then constitute
</p>
<p>the real strength of England, instead of being, as
</p>
<p>she was at present, a source of weakness and
</p>
<p>embarrassment to her. These were blessings worth
</p>
<p>struggling for, and they had come there that day
</p>
<p>to assist the liberator of their country in obtain-
</p>
<p>ing them." The object of the meeting was to
</p>
<p>petition parliament for the repeal of an act of
</p>
<p>the legislature, and that is a right that every Bri-
</p>
<p>tish subject is entitled to exercise. Independent of
</p>
<p>any other statute, the bill of rights asserted and de-
</p>
<p>fined the right of the subject to that constitutional
</p>
<p>privilege. The exercise of it was at one time en-
</p>
<p>deavoured to be curtailed ; but it was again asserted,
</p>
<p>and the legislature of England confirmed the sub-
</p>
<p>jects' rights, and declared by an act that " all com-
</p>
<p>mitments and prosecutions for such petitioning were
</p>
<p>illegal ;" and I will now, gentlemen, read a page for
</p>
<p>you from a work which you have frequently heard
</p>
<p>quoted in the course of this trial, 9lh Carrington and
</p>
<p>Payne, page 1 10, in which Baron Alderson holds the
</p>
<p>same principles as the right of the subject. And in
</p>
<p>the case of Kemp i>. Ncill, it was declared by resolu-
</p>
<p>tions of the house of commons that all such petitions
</p>
<p>were legal and receivable. The people of Ireland
</p>
<p>then did meet, and when their iirdversal feeling was
</p>
<p>demonstrated by those meetings, then was the time

</p>
<p>for them to present them to the house of commons.
</p>
<p>It is equally clear that they had a right to meet and
</p>
<p>discuss what they considered to be their grievances,
</p>
<p>as well as those which really were grievances, and
</p>
<p>such is the language of a carefully prefaced charge
</p>
<p>of the same judge. Baron Alderson, to thfe grand
</p>
<p>jury of the county of ilonraouth so late as 1839, and
</p>
<p>there cannot be the least doubt of it. I now beg to
</p>
<p>refer your lordships to the doctrine laid down by
</p>
<p>De Lorme in his work called " The Constitution of
</p>
<p>England," page 310, which is to the same effect.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the crown have proved that those
</p>
<p>meetings did take place, but they have proved no-
</p>
<p>thing to show that any one of them was an illegal
</p>
<p>assembly. Tlie crown, I say, have established that
</p>
<p>they were convened for legal purposes ; they have
</p>
<p>not attempted to show anything to the contraiy,
</p>
<p>and it is a rule of law as well as of common sense
</p>
<p>that no criminal intent is to be assumed with suf-
</p>
<p>ficient proof, either by direct or circumstantial evi-
</p>
<p>dence of its existence. The resolutions at these
</p>
<p>meetings having been passed, a resolution of loyalty
</p>
<p>and attachment to tlie Queen was adopted, and the
</p>
<p>people separated, after having given three cheers
</p>
<p>for her Majesty. When that demonstration for
</p>
<p>loyalty had been made the people dispersed. The
</p>
<p>only speech at that meeting which is charged as an
</p>
<p>overt act, is that of Mr. Barrett, and his after-dinner
</p>
<p>speech is selected for that purpose. The same sen-
</p>
<p>tence spoken .before dinner might be open to the
</p>
<p>charge of indiscretion, but it appears to me to be the
</p>
<p>greatest confusion of metaphorical language I ever
</p>
<p>met with the allusion to the old woman's cow.
</p>
<p>I can't understand it . It was, as I said, a confusion
</p>
<p>MR. M'DONOGH'S ARGUJIENT FOR THE DEFENCE,
</p>
<p>357
</p>
<p>to be found guilty, because of that ? "We shall give
</p>
<p>proof about that matter ; we shall not permit it to
</p>
<p>suUy the character of these meetings. We shall
</p>
<p>prove that it -was ordered to be taken down the
</p>
<p>moment it fell under the observation of those who
</p>
<p>took a part in the meeting. Another motto was 
</p>
<p>" Kepeal, Justice and Prosperity to all creeds and
</p>
<p>classes," and that was suft'ered to remain. That
</p>
<p>did not dishonour the meeting. Mr. Stewart ad-
</p>
<p>mitted that the meeting was of a peaceable ten-
</p>
<p>dency, but that the people came there witli great re-
</p>
<p>gularity on horseback. Why, no honest man could
</p>
<p>blame them for not allowing their wives and children
</p>
<p>to be trampled on by travelling in regular order.
</p>
<p>He would recollect that, but he could not remember
</p>
<p>that anything was said about ribbon societies. He
</p>
<p>did not see ' Repeal and no Separation," nor did he
</p>
<p>see " God save the Queen," with the emblems of a
</p>
<p>rose, thistle, and shamrock entwined around it, and
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I trust in God, and I am sure I speak the
</p>
<p>sentiments of my client, long may she and her de-
</p>
<p>scendants wear that crown adorned with the sham-
</p>
<p>rock, rose, and tliistle around it.

<p>course of this trial, 1 would bo glad your lordships
</p>
<p>would hear me on Monday, and not call on me this
</p>
<p>day. I can promise the court that in what I have

<p>to say, and it is not much, I shall condense still
</p>
<p>more, by knowing that I shall be called upon on

<p>Monday.

</p>
<p>MR. M'DONOGH RESUMED.
</p>
<p>He commented upon the evidence produced with
</p>
<p>respect to the Baltmglass, Longford.Clifden, and Tara
</p>
<p>meetings. In referring to the Tara meeting he said  .
</p>
<p>With respect to what had been stated concerning
</p>
<p>Captain Despard, he agreed with Mr. Hatchell, that
</p>
<p>the affair was nothing more than a joke of some
</p>
<p>clever Irishman, whom he believed he would be able
</p>
<p>to produce. Mr. Trevelyan, a writer of one of the
</p>
<p>morning papers, while travelling in a hackney car,
</p>
<p>asked the driver what the letters G.P.O. meant,
</p>
<p>which he observed on tlie milestones ? The reply
</p>
<p>was " God preserve O'Connell." Now he (the
</p>
<p>driver) was humbugging, just as the man hum-
</p>
<p>bugged Captain Despard. He (Mr. M'Donogh)
</p>
<p>could prove to the satisfaction of the jury that the
</p>
<p>person who quizzed Despard was neither moi'e nor
</p>
<p>less than some pleasant Irishman, who said to him-
</p>
<p>self, " Come, I will have a joke with you." The
</p>
<p>next meeting was that of MuUaghmast. An attempt
</p>
<p>had been made to show that a placard had been
</p>
<p>written and published in furtherance of the com-
</p>
<p>mon plan and design of conspiracy, which, it was
</p>
<p>alleged, existed amongst the traversers ; but any-
</p>
<p>356
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>vote of confidence in Mr. O'Connell, and the fourth
</p>
<p>'was to the effect that a petition be forwarded to the
</p>
<p>house of lords and commons for a repeal of the legis-
</p>
<p>lative union. Mr. O'Connell made a speech upon
</p>
<p>that occasion, in which he said that he had two ob-
</p>
<p>jects one of wluch was, to proclaim to Ireland that
</p>
<p>there was but one way of obtaining the repeal, and
</p>
<p>that was by obedience to everything bearing the
</p>
<p>form of legal authority. Resistance was not right
</p>
<p>until lethal authority was done away with ; and the
</p>
<p>iron and dread hand of power was raised against
</p>
<p>them. Those were precisely the same sentiments
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell uttered at Mallow. At the
</p>
<p>Abbey-street meeting he also cautioned the people
</p>
<p>to obey everything that looked like legal authority,
</p>
<p>and they received the injunction with cheers and
</p>
<p>cries of " we will." He said he wanted to carry the
</p>
<p>repeal of the union without one drop of blood with-
</p>
<p>out disturbing the social order, but by legal and
</p>
<p>constitutional meansso that when he came to face
</p>
<p>his Redeemer at the moment of his account, he would
</p>
<p>have nothing to answer for in the advice he gave to
</p>
<p>the Irish people. Mark (said Mr. M'Donogh), we
</p>
<p>do not read this speech for ourselves the crown
</p>
<p>have actually read it against us. He would now
</p>
<p>come to certain publications attributed to Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett. The indictment embraced proceedings and
</p>
<p>publications of Mr. Barrett's for a period of about
</p>
<p>nine months. He published, during that period,
</p>
<p>three times a week, each paper, containing three or
</p>
<p>four columns of leaded matter. After all the assi-
</p>
<p>duity of the crown, they were only able to bring
</p>
<p>against him the publication of reports of meetings,
</p>
<p>and his attendance at three dinners. Four leading

</p>
<p>articles are all that is chai-ged against him. Now,
</p>
<p>with respect to the first, it is a report of public
</p>
<p>meetings which he, as a matter of course, published
</p>
<p>cotemporaneous with other journals of the city. The
</p>
<p>Saunders, the Monitor, and other papers, published
</p>
<p>the same things, some, perhaps, in a more abridged
</p>
<p>shape, and others more enlarged ; and will you, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, say that these papers are guilty of a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy for having done so ? This is a class of publica-
</p>
<p>tion which is generally done by the sub-editor, or
</p>
<p>scissors-man, who cuts out the report from other
</p>
<p>journals, and condenses it, or otherwise ; and in all
</p>
<p>the cases where reports of public meetings are given
</p>
<p>jn the Pilot, I only find one headed " from our own
</p>
<p>reporter," not one more, all the rest being copied
</p>
<p>from the Kilkenny Journal, Drogheda Aryvs, the i'>ee-
</p>
<p>man's Journal, or Other papers, and was Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>to be charged with a conspiracy for doing what was
</p>
<p>done by every newspaper in the world ? Mr. Bar-
</p>
<p>rett was charged with having made three speeches,
</p>
<p>but he never attended one of the monster meetings
</p>
<p>at all, not because he repudiated them, but for the
</p>
<p>plain and simple reason that he was not a member
</p>
<p>of the repeal association. It was stated by Jackson
</p>
<p>that Mr. Barrett handed in money to the association,
</p>
<p>and that was all. He did not make a speech there
</p>
<p>in his hfe, nor was he charged with having done so,
</p>
<p>it was not even attributed to him that he did so.
</p>
<p>He attended there, and because he had the honesty
</p>
<p>to hand in money that was remitted to him from the
</p>
<p>country, he was charged with being a conspirator.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett merely handed in money intrusted to
</p>
<p>him, but he never paid one shilling himself to the
</p>
<p>association, nor did he in any manner interfere with
</p>
<p>MB. IM'DONOGH'S ARGOTIENT FOR THE DEFENCE,

<p>359
</p>
<p>at the expense of one drop of blood ; and thiit in liis
</p>
<p>time, and while he lived, not a drop of blood should
</p>
<p>be spilled except it might be his own ; that he
</p>
<p>wished to exhibit his gratitude to the Americans ;
</p>
<p>but at the same time to point out the species of
</p>
<p>peaceable support he would receive, and that he
</p>
<p>sought no change that would not be effected by legal
</p>
<p>and moral means. He (Mr. O'C.) concluded by
</p>
<p>proposing that the thanks of the association should
</p>
<p>be conveyed to Mr. Tyler, and that a letter, expres-
</p>
<p>sive of the opinions of the association, should be
</p>
<p>written by Mr. Kay to Mr. Tyler. Mr. M'Donogh
</p>
<p>then read that letter, and went on to observe that
</p>
<p>that was the manner in which the sentiments of Mr.
</p>
<p>Tyler had been responded to, and that was the mode
</p>
<p>in which the sjnnpathy of the Americans was ac-
</p>
<p>cepted  every means of effecting the objects of the
</p>
<p>association that were not moral and peaceable were
</p>
<p>rejected. He then said he would read a document
</p>
<p>as evidence of the peaceable intentions of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation  it was the plan for the forniation of the
</p>
<p>National Repeal Association, as published on the
</p>
<p>15th of April, 1840, three years before any attempt
</p>
<p>was made to suppress that body. [He then read
</p>
<p>the rules of the association.] He then observed
</p>
<p>that the rules of 1840 were acted upon in 1843.
</p>
<p>That they had not been changed or deviated from,
</p>
<p>and embodied the same spirit and principles  the
</p>
<p>same sentiments were continually repeated  the
</p>
<p>same moral and peaceable means were over and
</p>
<p>over again promulgated ; and was it because an
</p>
<p>angry expression had occasionally fallen from some
</p>
<p>of the traversers, that the jury were to fasten fas-
</p>
<p>tidiously upon it, and exclude their repeatedly

<p>peaceable declarations from their consideration ? If
</p>
<p>the rules which he had read were the rules of that
</p>
<p>body, it was absurd to say it was an illegal one.
</p>
<p>Here the Cliief Justice asked for the newspaper
</p>
<p>containing the rules to be handed to him.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  1 have now to refer to an act of
</p>
<p>one of those defendants, and it is the act of the
</p>
<p>whole of that body. I refer to the Freeman's Journal
</p>
<p>of the 30th of January, 1841. "At a meeting of
</p>
<p>the repeal association, Jlr. O'Neill Daunt said it
</p>
<p>was now his pleasing duty to state that answers
</p>
<p>had been received from her Majesty and his Royal
</p>
<p>Highness Prince Albert, announcing the receipt of
</p>
<p>the address forwarded to them by the association,
</p>
<p>congratulating them on the birth of the Princess
</p>
<p>Eoyal (immense cheering). The learned gentleman
</p>
<p>read the letter Mr. Ray forwarded with the address,
</p>
<p>and replies of Mr. Maule, acknowledging its re-
</p>

<p>men, for unfortunate they are, whatever may be

<p>the result of this trial, who are now stigmatised
</p>
<p>before the public as traitors, planning the sever-
</p>
<p>ance of those countries, are from the year 1840 to
</p>
<p>1843, known to the authorities, inviting by their

<p>rules the interference of the authorities amongst

<p>them, and declaring they would tlirow open their

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>Barrett reproved the person that put that article
</p>
<p>into his paper. I call the attention of the court to
</p>
<p>this proposition, that although, on a constructive
</p>
<p>publication in a newspaper, an arbitrary rule has
</p>
<p>been adopted by the judges that the publication shall
</p>
<p>te evidence against the party in the indictment for
</p>
<p>libel, even though his mind was not guilty. That
</p>
<p>cannot hold, however, where the charge is that he
</p>
<p>conspired ; for where the indictment is for conspi-
</p>
<p>racy it must be shown that he was not only guilty
</p>
<p>in act but in intention. The next letter to which lie
</p>
<p>would refer was one signed by a Rev. Mr. Power, a
</p>
<p>parish clergyman of the Konian Catholic persuasion,
</p>
<p>and that letter referred to " the duties of a soldier."
</p>
<p>He thought it singular, in the annals of jurispru-
</p>
<p>dence, that, instead of instituting a prosecution
</p>
<p>against the writer, if it deserved a prosecution, that
</p>
<p>it should be instituted against one who had no con-
</p>
<p>nection with it. Mr. Power's name was subscribed
</p>
<p>to that letter, and he was ready to avow it  he was
</p>
<p>ready to justify it  and he will do so before the ter-
</p>
<p>mination of the trials, when it will be shown that at
</p>
<p>the time that letter was received, Mr. Barrett was
</p>
<p>absent in his country house. AVhy should a letter,
</p>
<p>which was printed in his newspaper, during his ab-
</p>
<p>sence, make him liable to punishment ? or how can
</p>
<p>it prove that he entered into the conspiracy charged
</p>
<p>in the indictment  a letter, the contents of which he
</p>
<p>was, when written, altogether ignorant? Did, he
</p>
<p>would ask, that letter communicate the purpose of
</p>
<p>his client's mind, and the fact that he had entered
</p>
<p>into the conspiracy ? Quite the reverse ; for, as al-
</p>
<p>ready stated, he knew nothing about its contents.
</p>

</p>
<p>proved his assertion " that unless they were satisfied
</p>
<p>of a previous conspiracy, they were bound to acquit
</p>
<p>the defendants." That fact was involved in the'
</p>
<p>consideration. It would not do to reach any, or all
</p>
<p>of them, by arguing in a circle, or to surround the
</p>
<p>entire of them by meshing them altogether ; they,
</p>
<p>the jury, were bound on the oath they had sworn
</p>
<p>that there was a previous conspiracy, they were to
</p>
<p>do that if they could. As to the letter written by
</p>
<p>Mr. Power, (and of which Mr. Barrett had no know-
</p>
<p>ledge, and of the publication of which he knew no-
</p>
<p>thing,) he therein put forth his sentiments, and
</p>
<p>which he published to the world ; and in doing that
</p>
<p>he only followed the example of men who were
</p>
<p>equally attached to the soldiery, who had no idea to
</p>
<p>corrupt them, whose only object was to inculcate on
</p>
<p>them moral duty. There was a remarkable trial on
</p>
<p>that subject to which he would refer. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General of that day, and it was a most agita-
</p>
<p>ting period, filed informations against John Drakard.
</p>
<p>He would read the particularsfrom Lord Brougham's
</p>
<p>speeches, Introduction, pages 7, 8, 9. The very
</p>
<p>same charge was also attempted to be brought
</p>
<p>against a public journalist. Had any one of the
</p>
<p>troops serving in Ireland departed from his alle-
</p>
<p>giance to the sovereign, or had any attempts been
</p>
<p>made to tamper with one of them ? Had any sol-
</p>
<p>dier been brought forward to support the charge ?
</p>
<p>Not one. It was sought to produce a certain result,
</p>
<p>which certain result had not, and could not be
</p>
<p>produced. The leading articles published in the
</p>
<p>Pilot newspaper could not be brought forward as
</p>
<p>libels. Supposing that they were published by Mr.
</p>
<p>Barrett's consent, they only showed that he (Mr.
</p>

</p>
<p>361
</p>
<p>lawyer told the jury that they were not to deny the
</p>
<p>prisoner his presumption of innocence, even thougli
</p>
<p>an act of parliament had been passed characterising
</p>
<p>his conduct as a conspiracy to subvert the monarchy.
</p>
<p>He warned the jury ag.ainst giving any weight in
</p>
<p>their dehberations to the voice of the legislature.
</p>
<p>He (Mr. M'Donogh) trusted the same course recom-
</p>
<p>mended by that Attorney-General would be adopted
</p>
<p>by the jiiry in the present case. He (Mr. M'Do-
</p>
<p>nogh) had heard the Queen's speech with profound
</p>
<p>contcmpt_(much laughter)  with profound respect
</p>
<p>and veneration. He was sure his learned friends
</p>
<p>would admit that that was a mere mistake ; and
</p>
<p>when he committed that mistake speaking before
</p>
<p>them in the sincerity of his heart, would they con-
</p>
<p>vict Mr. Barrett for any similar mistake into which
</p>
<p>he might have in.advertently fallen ?
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice At what part of your speech
</p>
<p>do you think you are now ?
</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh My lord, I .ipprehend I have not
</p>
<p>much more to add, as I do not intend to go over
</p>
<p>any of the ground which has been so ably argued.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice Well, the jury had better re-
</p>
<p>tire, and it is now more tlian half-past one.
</p>
<p>The court then adjourned for the purposeof taking
</p>
<p>some refreshment.
</p>
<p>When their lordships had returned Mr. M'Donogh
</p>
<p>resumed his address. He reminded the jury that
</p>
<p>it was a settled law of the land, that when a man
</p>
<p>was accused of any offence, whether conspiracy or
</p>
<p>anything else, it was absolutely necessary th.at the
</p>
<p>jury, before they returned a verdict of guilty, should
</p>
<p>be satisfied that the evidence adduced on the prose-
</p>
<p>cution was such as to bring guilt home to him be-

<p>yond the possibility of doubt. This point had been
</p>
<p>distinctly ruled so in the case of the King v. Pollard,
</p>
<p>2nd Campbell's Reports, page 293, and there were
</p>
<p>two points upon which the jury should be clearly
</p>
<p>convinced in their own minds before they found a
</p>
<p>verdict against the traversers. The first was the
</p>
<p>actual existence of the conspiracy, and the second
</p>
<p>was the purpose, design, or intent of the persons
</p>
<p>who were partners in that, so called, conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Erskine had acknowledged the truth of this
</p>
<p>maxim of law, and had stated the principle with
</p>
<p>much distinctness in Hardj-'s case, page 359, of
</p>
<p>" Kidgeway's Life of Erskine." [The learned counsel
</p>
<p>here read the passage referred to.] The jury, in a
</p>
<p>case of imputed crime, ought invariablj' to view the
</p>
<p>whole case as exhibited by the evidence, and if, after
</p>
<p>a calm and dispassionate review of the testimony,
</p>
<p>they felt any doubt of the guilt of the traversers,
</p>
<p>they were bound in duty to give them the benefit of
</p>
<p>it. Soraetliing had been said at the commencement
</p>
<p>of the present trial in allusion to the construction of
</p>
<p>the jury, but this was a topic upon which he would
</p>
<p>not touch, for he would never utter a word that
</p>
<p>could be by possibiUty construed into an expression
</p>
<p>of doubt upon his part, that the respectable and in-
</p>
<p>telligent gentlemen whom he had the honour to ad-
</p>
<p>dress would discharge their duty with firmness, pro-
</p>
<p>priety, and discreetness. If they had upon their
</p>
<p>minds any rational doubt of the alleged conspiracy
</p>
<p>having been substantially proved by the evidence
</p>
<p>that had been adduced on behalf of the crown, they
</p>
<p>should not, they could not, find the traversers guilty.
</p>
<p>He admitted that he felt deeply interested in the
</p>
<p>results of the present proceedings, for if the jury

<p>applicable to it. ^Vell couviuced am I that there
</p>
<p>was not in your city a sincere and honest repealer
</p>
<p>who did not pronounce a rerdict of "not guilty,"
</p>
<p>before they were put on their trial; and equally
</p>
<p>convinced am I, that there was not an honest and
</p>
<p>conscientious opponent of repeal who did not pro-
</p>
<p>nounce a rerdict of " guilty." I am, therefore,
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the jury, anxious to impress upon your
</p>
<p>minds that this is not the question you have to try.
</p>
<p>It is immaterial what opinions we may entertain
</p>
<p>with respect to the policy of repeal, or the benefits
</p>
<p>or the mischief that may result from its discussion.
</p>
<p>It may be unbecoming in me to intrude upon you or
</p>
<p>upon the public my own political opinions ; but I
</p>
<p>do not hesitate to say that I differ in opinion from
</p>
<p>the traversers in this case ; I do not hesitate to avow
</p>
<p>that, notwithstanding all I have read, or all I have
</p>
<p>heard, I retain the honest opinion that a repeal of the
</p>
<p>union would be fraught with mischief to England,
</p>
<p>and ruin to Ireland. I will not, however, say, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the jury, that I have not heard much since
</p>
<p>this trial commenced, calculated to shake tlie opi-
</p>
<p>nion I had previously formed, and will readily con-
</p>
<p>fess, that I would now, with much greater doubt,
</p>
<p>enter into an argument on that question, than I
</p>
<p>would have done before. But still I have the pre-
</p>
<p>sumption to retain the opinion I had previously
</p>
<p>formed ; and though I know there are hundred.^,
</p>
<p>thousands, millions, of my countrymen who honestly
</p>
<p>entertain a different opinion, and though I see many
</p>
<p>amongst them much more competent to form an
</p>
<p>opinion than I am, I claim the right to announce
</p>
<p>that opinion  I claim the right to enforce that opi-
</p>
<p>nion by all legitimate means, and by all arguments

</p>
<p>that I could use, to induce others to adopt it  I
</p>
<p>claim the right, if I feel that there is a great body
</p>
<p>of persons coinciding with me in that opinion, re-
</p>
<p>spectable from their intelligence, and respectable
</p>
<p>from their numbers  I claim the right to make
</p>
<p>known to the government of the day, and to the
</p>
<p>minister who holds the reins of government, that
</p>
<p>fact. Gentlemen of tlie jury, the right I claim, I
</p>
<p>feel I am bound to concede. Nay more, on the part
</p>
<p>of the traverser for whom I address you, I claim
</p>
<p>that right for him ; and I assert, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, that the traverser here, honestly and con-
</p>
<p>scientiously believing that a repeal of the union is
</p>
<p>essential for the well being of this country, has a
</p>
<p>right to entertain  has a right to announce  has a
</p>
<p>right to convince others, that that opinion is right 
</p>
<p>has a right to collect the sense of the nation, and
</p>
<p>has a right to collect that in such a manner as will
</p>
<p>apprise the minister of the day what are the real
</p>
<p>seutiments of the people that are governed by
</p>
<p>hira. Gentlemen of the jury, I therefore say again,
</p>
<p>that the question to be discussed here is not wliether
</p>
<p>repeal is beneficial or not, or whether the discussion
</p>
<p>of it is beneficial or not ; but it will be my duty to
</p>
<p>call your attention to what the precise questions
</p>
<p>are which you have to try, for without an accurate
</p>
<p>knowledge of what the precise questions are, it
</p>
<p>will be utterly impossible to apply the evidence
</p>
<p>which you have heard in this case, to Avliich, with
</p>
<p>great pleasure I observe you have attended, for
</p>
<p>without the extraordinary attention  without the

<p>intellect would not be able to collect out of the mass

</p>
<p>has thought fit to put on their trial eight traversers ;
</p>
<p>they have thought fit to put upon the files of this
</p>
<p>court what may well be called a " monster iudict-
</p>
<p>ment;" they have thought fit to include in that
</p>
<p>indictment a vast variety of charges, and they have
</p>
<p>thought fit to spread upon the face of it a vast num-
</p>
<p>ber of what are called overt acts. Of that, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I do not complain. I do not complain of their
</p>
<p>stating any overtacts of which they meant to oSer
</p>
<p>evidence ; but I do complain that they have put us
</p>
<p>to unnecessary trouble and expense in preparing to
</p>
<p>defend ourselves with respect to a variety of overt
</p>
<p>acts stated in this indictment, and stated in the bill
</p>
<p>of particulars in support of it, of which not a par-
</p>
<p>ticle of evidence is offered. But you will keep this
</p>
<p>in mind, that your verdict does not necessarily de-
</p>
<p>pend upon the proof of a negative of the overt
</p>
<p>acts. The overt acts are not tlie charges of crime.
</p>
<p>You might be satisfied that every one of the overt
</p>
<p>acts was proved, and it would not necessarily follow
</p>
<p>that you should convict for the crime. The overt
</p>
<p>acts, gentlemen, are but stated in evidence of it,
</p>
<p>and the proof of the overt acts would not necessarily
</p>
<p>lead to the conclusion that the particular charge was
</p>
<p>supported ; and so I would admit, that although the
</p>
<p>overt acts were not all proved, you might, neverthe-
</p>
<p>less, be satisfied upon the evidence that a criminal
</p>
<p>charge was proved. Now, gentlemen of the jury,

<p>and to cause, and aid in causing, divers subjects un-
</p>
<p>lawfully and seditiously to meet and assemble toge-

<p>ther in large numbers at various times and at dif-
</p>
<p>ferent places for the unlawful and seditious purpose
</p>
<p>of obtaining, by means of the intimidation to be

<p>thereby caused, and by means of the exhibition and
</p>
<p>demonstration of great physical force, changes and
</p>
<p>alterations in the government, laws, and constitution
</p>
<p>as by law established, and to bring into hatred and
</p>
<p>disrepute the courts established by law in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and to diminish the confidence of her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects in the administration of the law therein, with
</p>
<p>the intent to induce thera to witlidraw the adjudi-

<p>cation of their difierences from the cognizance of
</p>
<p>those courts, and subject thera to the judgment and

<p>determination of tribunals to be constituted for the

<p>proceeds to say that they did unlawfully, malici-
</p>
<p>ously, and seditiously combine, with divers persons
</p>
<p>unknown, to do what, gentlemen ? Now, here is
</p>
<p>the first charge  to raise and create discontent and
</p>
<p>disaffection amongst the liege subjects of our lady
</p>
<p>the Queen. That is the first charge preferred by
</p>
<p>this indictment, that they did conspii-e to raise

<p>and create discontent and disaffection among the

<p>364
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>the gOTemment ? What means the goverument?
</p>
<p>If the ministry of the day, tlie charge is idle and
</p>
<p>absurd. Tliere can bo no such thing as disaffection
</p>
<p>to the ministry. God forbid I should live to see
</p>
<p>the day when it would be said to be a criminal
</p>
<p>offence to excite disatfection against the ministry.
</p>
<p>Is it the government in anotlier sense? Docs the go-
</p>
<p>vernment mean the constitution by law established?
</p>
<p>Could you convict them for that ? What means the
</p>
<p>constitution ? It is the government of the realm by
</p>
<p>the king, lords, and commons ; but it is perfectly'
</p>
<p>consistent with that constitution that there may be a
</p>
<p>separate pailiameut  that there may be independent
</p>
<p>legislatures  that there may be a house of lords and a
</p>
<p>house of commons in England, and a house of lords
</p>
<p>and house of commons in Ireland, and one common
</p>
<p>Sovereign. That was the constitution before the
</p>
<p>act of union incorporating the two legislatures ;
</p>
<p>that act did subvert the then constitution ; the re-
</p>
<p>peal of that act would restore the two independent
</p>
<p>legislatures, and leave the constitution untouched.
</p>
<p>It is idle and absurd to say  I do not think it will be
</p>
<p>said  I have not as yet heard it said that it would be
</p>
<p>treason, or that it would be a criminal offence to
</p>
<p>endeavour to procure the repeal of the union, upon
</p>
<p>the ground that it would be endangering the con-
</p>
<p>stitution. Gentlemen of the jury, what is the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of disaffection to the Queen ? I will tell you
</p>
<p>what it is : that on every opportunity and on every
</p>
<p>occasion Mr. O'Connell, who is one of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers  and the general traverser here, I would say
</p>
<p>never omitted to proclaim his loyalty and his de-
</p>
<p>voted affection to the Quceu  to proclaim it in a
</p>
<p>manner the most impressive and best calculated to

</p>
<p>inspire those feelings into the auditory he addressed.
</p>
<p>I protest I tind no other evidence in the case of dis-
</p>
<p>affection to the Queen. But we are told, gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, that men may say one thing and mean
</p>
<p>another. No doubt they may ; but those who im-
</p>
<p>pute a crime  those who impute a meaning different
</p>
<p>to that which is expressed  are bound to prove it ;
</p>
<p>and this is not only charity, but it is justice to a man
</p>
<p>who uses certain expressions in their plain and or-
</p>
<p>dinary meaning ; and I say no jury could, on mere
</p>
<p>suspicion, impute a different meaning to them in
</p>
<p>the absence of proof ; the avowed expression itself is
</p>
<p>noproof of a different meaning. How are weto judge
</p>
<p>of the thoughts of men ? How, but by their words and
</p>
<p>by their actions. Wehave his words ; what are his ac-
</p>
<p>tions ? Why, gentlemen of the jury, if his object, or
</p>
<p>the object of any of the traversers here, was to create
</p>
<p>disaffection to the Queen, tlunk you would the
</p>
<p>professions of loyalty to the Queen be repeated at
</p>
<p>the times, at the places, and under the circumstances
</p>
<p>that they were ? Think you would he announce it
</p>
<p>at the close of almost every meeting to the assem-
</p>
<p>bled multitudes ? Think you he would have as-
</p>
<p>serted it in such a manner as to have drawn forth
</p>
<p>thunders of applause and cheers that made " the
</p>
<p>welkin ring?" Think you that they were all hypo-
</p>
<p>crites ? think you, gentlemen, that those professions
</p>
<p>of loyalty were addressed in open day to the assem-
</p>
<p>bled multitudes with a covert purpose of creating
</p>
<p>disaffection ? The thought is idle. If he thought
</p>
<p>of disaffection in his heart, he took the most extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary means to accomplish it ; I say that every
</p>
<p>speech was calculated to counteract it, and that it

<p>(fid produce that effect is beyond all doubt. Gen-

<p>ire also, gentlemen of the jury, some publications
</p>
<p>read there were publications that I do not stand
</p>
<p>here to defend, inserted in one or two papers. Tliere
</p>
<p>is amongst others, a letter of a priest, the Kev.
</p>
<p>Mr. Power, published in one of those papers. I
</p>
<p>will not trouble you with canvassing that letter.
</p>
<p>The counsel of the editor has been heard ; but I say
</p>
<p>it is unfair, unjust, it is harsh .and oppressive to
</p>
<p>make use of that as evidence against the otlier tra-
</p>
<p>versers here, or as evidence even against him to sup-
</p>
<p>port the eliarge of conspiracy. The plain, the sim-
</p>
<p>ple, the obvious, tlie direct, the manly, tlie honest
</p>
<p>course isabaudoncd, and a circuitous course is taken.
</p>
<p>And, gentlemen, it is soui^ht now to convict one
</p>
<p>man of another's acts, and to use the acts of one as
</p>
<p>evidence against the others, arguing thus in a cir-
</p>
<p>cle. Admitting that where the object is leg.tl, the
</p>
<p>illegal act of one is not evidence against the other 
</p>
<p>admitting that if the common intents be todo the ille-
</p>
<p>gal action, then that the illegal act is evidence ; what
</p>
<p>do they do ? Tliey take the act whicli they say is il-
</p>
<p>legally done by one in furtherance of the common
</p>
<p>legal object, and they use that not as evidence of a
</p>
<p>combination to do a legal act, for that would not
</p>
<p>support them, but as evidence of a conspiracy to do
</p>
<p>an illegal act. They hope (but I trust their lord-
</p>
<p>ships will guard you against being misled) by this
</p>
<p>means, gentlemen of the jury, to get in aid the acts
</p>
<p>of persons over whom Jlr. O'Connell had no con-
</p>
<p>trol  of persons over whom Mr. Steele had uo con-
</p>
<p>trol, nominally to support the charge of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, but really and truly, gentlemen of the jury,

<p>ter). Now, gentlemen of the jury, I complain of
</p>
<p>that. I say that that is not lair dealing. I say
</p>
<p>that if any of tliose publications had the tendency
</p>
<p>here stated, that it should be submitted to you in
</p>
<p>another and cle.irer form, they should have made
</p>
<p>each man responsible for his own acts, and his own
</p>
<p>acts alone, and put tlie matter iu a course of trial
</p>
<p>that would enable the crown to bring forward its
</p>
<p>case, shortly, simply, and clearly, and state simply
</p>
<p>and clearly what their case was and their evidence,
</p>
<p>60 that men of ordinary intelligence should easil}-
</p>
<p>see if the charge were supported or not, and enable
</p>
<p>you without difficulty to hear the case of the crown
</p>
<p>and the evidence oifered in support of it  to hear the
</p>
<p>case for the defence and the evidence produced to
</p>
<p>support it, and then come to a conclusion without
</p>
<p>difficulty, and not inflict a task on you almost be-
</p>
<p>yond the powers of luunan intellect. The next
</p>
<p>charge, and one on wliich, it appears to nic, the
</p>
<p>greatest stress has been laid, is a charge " for
</p>
<p>causing and procuring divers subjects of our Lady
</p>
<p>the Queen unlawfully, miiliciously, and seditiously
</p>
<p>to meet and assem1)le together in large numbers,
</p>
<p>at various times, and at different places within
</p>
<p>Ireland, for the unlawful .and seditious purpose of
</p>
<p>obtaining by intimidation, to be thereby caused,
</p>
<p>and by means of tlie exhibition and demonstration
</p>
<p>of great physical force at such assemblies, a change
</p>
<p>.and alteration in the government, laws, and con-
</p>
<p>stitution of this realm, as by law established." I pass
</p>
<p>by two of the objects, namely, to obtain changes in
</p>
<p>the government and the constitution, and I come to
</p>
<p>that wliich charges them with causing large num-
</p>
<p>bers to assemble, to obtain by means of intimidation,

</p>
<p>ful. What is the evidence that they were not law-
</p>
<p>ful ? I was startled when I heard it. The evidence
</p>
<p>produced to show that they were not lawful is that
</p>
<p>they were quiet, and that Mr. O'Connell, at every
</p>
<p>one of those meetings, preached and inculcated peace,
</p>
<p>and that is corroborated by the damning fact that
</p>
<p>his advice was obeyed and peace was preserved.
</p>
<p>That is evidence of the character of those meetings.
</p>
<p>I admit that tlie people assembling in vast masses
</p>
<p>rendered it Ukely that danger might ensue, and that
</p>
<p>at the first meeting men of ordinary courage might
</p>
<p>entertain alarm, though it did not appear they did,
</p>
<p>and take measures to stop them ; but each succeed-
</p>
<p>ing meeting negatived the possibility of injury
</p>
<p>arising from them ; gave proofs of the legality of
</p>
<p>their proceedings, and there is no otlier way for ac-
</p>
<p>counting for tlie conduct of the government than
</p>
<p>that they believed them to be so. The conduct of
</p>
<p>the government would be infamous in the extreme,
</p>
<p>Unless it resulted from the cause to which I have
</p>
<p>attributed it. It may appear strange that I should
</p>
<p>be here defending the conduct of the government
</p>
<p>from the aspersions cast upon it by their own de-
</p>
<p>fenders; and I do say the facts prove that those
</p>
<p>meetings were perfectly legal and perfectly peace-
</p>
<p>able. But then, gentlemen, there is another species
</p>
<p>of illegality alleged against them in this charge. It
</p>
<p>is, that the meetings were for the unlawful purpose
</p>
<p>of iutimidation, by the exhibition of physical force.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, is that charge supported ? I ask you,
</p>
<p>can you, as honest men, saj', that you believe there
</p>
<p>was any intention, on the part even of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell himself, (though again I say his act would not
</p>
<p>support the charge of conspiracy,) that those parties

<p>should resort to physical force, or, by the exhibition
</p>
<p>of it, intimidate ? I ask you, do you not believe
</p>
<p>that wliich he over and over again professed, were
</p>
<p>the real and genuine sentiments of liis heart ? I
</p>
<p>ask you, do you not believe that this was one of the
</p>
<p>means wliich, at the outset of my speech, I told you
</p>
<p>I, or you, or any man would be justified in using, in
</p>
<p>order to bring conviction to the mind of the minis-
</p>
<p>ter, by the publication and expression of the people's
</p>
<p>Bentiments ? I ask you, after all you have heard
</p>
<p>from those eloquent persons that preceded me, as to
</p>
<p>the meetings in England, can you doubt that the
</p>
<p>real object was to evince to the government of the
</p>
<p>country in a manner that would bring home to their
</p>
<p>minds most clearly and satisfactorily what the sen-
</p>
<p>timents of the Irish people are  the real majority of
</p>
<p>the Irish people ? Do you imagine that Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell really intended to march with those repeal war-
</p>
<p>dens, to encounter the artillery of Great Britain ?
</p>
<p>Do you think that he intended to assail the liouse of
</p>
<p>commons ? Do you think he had the slightest
</p>
<p>thought to induce the minister of Great Britain to
</p>
<p>apprehend an outbreak of physical force. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, his whole life belies the charge ; for I do say,
</p>
<p>if ever there was a man who wielded such power
</p>
<p>over his fellow-man, there never was a man wlio
</p>
<p>would shrink with more abhorrence from the least
</p>
<p>appearance of crime, or blood, or physical force.
</p>
<p>I do say, gentlemen, his life belies the charge. I
</p>
<p>say the whole progress of the agitation, which had
</p>
<p>for its object the accomplishment of Catholic eman-
</p>
<p>cipation, proves the greatand beneficial effects arising
</p>

<p>only vary in the phraseology. The seventh count I
</p>
<p>shall advert to ; it is a short one. It is a charge
</p>
<p>that they conspired and agreed with each other, and
</p>
<p>with divers other persons  it is the same as I l-,ave
</p>
<p>been adverting to, but it states more distinctly that
</p>
<p>the change which they sought to effect in the law
</p>
<p>was the repeal of the act of union. But I must
</p>
<p>call your attention to the eleventh count, it is cer-
</p>
<p>tainly an extraordinary production. [Counsel here
</p>
<p>read the eleventh count of the indictment, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded]  Why, gentlemen, if the charge that they
</p>
<p>intended by the e.xhibition of physical force to in-
</p>
<p>timidate be not supported, can there be anything
</p>
<p>more ridiculous than to say that the object was by
</p>
<p>causing large numbers to assemble and hear seditious
</p>
<p>speeches, and by seditious publications to intimidate?
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, I have now gone through
</p>
<p>the charges preferred in tliis indictment, and let me
</p>
<p>ask you, are you satisfied in your consciences that
</p>
<p>any one of those charges is substantiated ? Are
</p>
<p>you not satisfied that if there was a co-operation at
</p>
<p>all it was to procure a repeal of the union ? But is
</p>
<p>there any evidence to satisfy j'ou that there was a
</p>
<p>pre-concert and an arrangement to do any of the
</p>
<p>illegal acts that are mentioned in this indictment ?
</p>
<p>I confess to you that I have been at times, in the
</p>
<p>progress of this trial, disgusted with my own pro-
</p>
<p>fession. I feel grieved and pained when I find men
</p>
<p>of high intellectual attainments, great information,
</p>
<p>and unquestioned honour, resorting to the species
</p>
<p>of arguments I have heard urged in this case ; and
</p>
<p>when I find men of that description coming down
</p>
<p>with arguments to meet every possible state of
</p>
<p>facts, prepared to draw from the directly opposite

</p>
<p>facts the same conclusion, and to ask tlie jury to
</p>
<p>come to that conclusion which they wish to establish.
</p>
<p>If at any of those meetings any language calculated
</p>
<p>to lead to a breach of the peace had been used, with
</p>
<p>what triumph would it have been fastened upon? If
</p>
<p>they had heard, as at some of the meetings in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, " down with the Queen ;" and if there had
</p>
<p>been an insult offered to the Queen's name, how pro-
</p>
<p>perly and triumphantly would it have been relied
</p>
<p>upon as evidence of a criminal intention ? But,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, you find no such thing. You find the
</p>
<p>absence of this and the presence of directly the
</p>
<p>contrary, and yet you find the counsel for the crown
</p>
<p>alleging that those facts equally lead to the same
</p>
<p>conclusion. If the declarations are made there is
</p>
<p>evidence of hypocrisy ; if the declarations are not
</p>
<p>made there is evidence of conspiracy. I profess I
</p>
<p>don't know how a man can defend himself from an
</p>
<p>argument such as this. But you will judge upon
</p>
<p>the whole of the case, and you will say whether you
</p>
<p>are satisfied with the evidence which has been gone
</p>
<p>over by those who have preceded me, with so
</p>
<p>much ability, that I shall not trouble you by
</p>
<p>going through the details of that evidence. But
</p>
<p>I beg of you to keep in mind, when you are apply-
</p>
<p>ing yourself to that evidence, what is the charge,
</p>
<p>and you must, before you pronounce a verdict
</p>
<p>against any of the traversers, be satisfied, beyond
</p>
<p>all reasonable doubt, that they did conspire together,
</p>
<p>not merely to procure, if they could, a repeal of the
</p>
<p>union, but to do those illegal acts that are specified
</p>
<p>in the indictment. Upon what, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, does the Attorney-General mainly rely ? Oh !
</p>
<p>he says, gentlemen, true it is the meetings were all

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>judgment upon it. as wise as ever -was pronounced by
</p>
<p>the sapient Dogberry himself (laughter). But I will
</p>
<p>tell you, gentlemen, what put Dogberry in my mind.
</p>
<p>It was one of the rules we learned at college that one of
</p>
<p>the helps to memory was the concatenation of ideas,
</p>
<p>and as soon as I heard tliis evidence, the name of a
</p>
<p>play in Shakespeare occurred to me  ' ' Much ado
</p>
<p>about nothing" (laughter)  in which play, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, Dogberry cuts a conspicuous figure (laughter).
</p>
<p>Upon one occjision a witness says in the presence of
</p>
<p>Dogberry, " I heard him say he had received a thou-
</p>
<p>sand ducats from Don John, for accusing the lady
</p>
<p>hero wrongfully." " Flat burglary," says Dogberry
</p>
<p>(laughter). And I can well believe, when they
</p>
<p>read this speech the exclamations of my learned
</p>
<p>friends  "treason," says the Attorney-General, "se-
</p>
<p>dition," says the milder Solicitor, " flat burglary,"
</p>
<p>says Brewster (loud laughter), and having found,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, combined, in this short speech, treason,
</p>
<p>sedition, and burglary, there could be no doubt at
</p>
<p>all that it should be convincing proof that Dufiy,
</p>
<p>Tierney, Barrett, and all the other traversers, who
</p>
<p>knew nothing on earth about it, were guilty of a foul
</p>
<p>conspiracy. Oh ! say they, we will put it in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. The scissors were brought into requisition,
</p>
<p>and, accordingly, this precious morsel is transplanted
</p>
<p>from the ephemeral productions of the day in which
</p>
<p>in a short time it would sink into oblivion, and
</p>
<p>it is given immortality by being transferred into
</p>
<p>this indictment. I can well conceive, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the feeling of the clerk when he was employed upon
</p>
<p>it. I think the Solicitor-General's recording angel
</p>
<p>must have blushed as he gave it in, and I should
</p>
<p>have thought his gentle nature would have induced

<p>him to drop a tear upon the page, and blot it out for
</p>
<p>ever (laughter). But it was otherwise ordained,
</p>
<p>and here it is, to descend to posterity a memorial of
</p>
<p>the eloquence of Tom Steele, the treason of H. B.,
</p>
<p>and satisfactory evidence of the leniency of the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, who omitted to include him in
</p>
<p>the charge of conspiracy, and a perpetual record of
</p>
<p>the wisdom and good sense of this prosecution. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, am 1 not right in treating that with le-
</p>
<p>vity? but as there is not sound argument in tliis, take
</p>
<p>it as an example, and by it judge of others. I ask
</p>
<p>you would it not be a monstrous and unjust and
</p>
<p>absm'd thing to saj' any of the charges here of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against the others is supported by this evi-
</p>
<p>dence of what Tom Steele said ? Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, it is really a mockery of justice to introduce
</p>
<p>such a speech as that, and rely upon that as an overt
</p>
<p>act establishing the charge of conspiracy against
</p>
<p>those persons. I shall not trouble you by going
</p>
<p>through the other facts of this case, they have been
</p>
<p>spoken to with great ability. 1 am glad my labours
</p>
<p>have been light, for if it had fallen to my lot to dis-
</p>
<p>cuss it in the first instance, I would have sunk under
</p>
<p>tliis task. I know my intellect would not have
</p>
<p>enabled me to cope with the variety of charges and
</p>
<p>the masses of evidence on which you are asked to
</p>
<p>come to the conclusion that some one of the charges
</p>
<p>is supported, but I am relieved from that duty by
</p>
<p>the circumstance of my following persons so much
</p>
<p>more able than myself. But I implore of you to
</p>
<p>consider well the vast importance of the duty you
</p>
<p>have to discharge. I am thoroughly convinced that

<p>Mr. O'Connell rose and said  Gentlemen, I beg
</p>
<p>your patient attention while I show you, in as few
</p>
<p>sentences as I possibly can, and in my own plain
</p>
<p>and prosaic style, the right I have to demand from
</p>
<p>you a favourable verdict. I ask it without disre-
</p>
<p>spect and without flattery  I ask it on the ground
</p>
<p>of common sense and common justice  upon these
</p>
<p>grounds I demand your favourable verdict, being
</p>
<p>thoroughly convinced that I am plainly entitled to
</p>
<p>it. I do not feel that I should have been warranted
</p>
<p>in addressing you at all after tlie many speeches you
</p>
<p>have already heard, and that powerful display of

<p>talent that so delighted, <as well as, I trust, in-

<p>My clients in this case are the Irish pi'ople  my
</p>
<p>client is Ireland  and I stand here tlie advocate of

<p>upon the grossest injustice  it was based upon the
</p>
<p>grossest insult  the intolerance of Irish prosperity.
</p>
<p>This was the motive that actuated the malefactoi-s
</p>
<p>who perpetrated that iniquity ; and I have the
</p>
<p>highest authority  the ornament for many years of
</p>
<p>that bench, but now, .and recently, in his honoured

</p>
<p>intolerance of Irish prosperity. Nor shall I leave

<p>that on his word alone. I have other authori-

<p>ties for it, with which I shall trouble you in the

<p>course of as brief  for I am exceedingly anxious to
</p>
<p>make as brief an address as I possibly can. I am
</p>
<p>not here to deny anything I have done, or here to
</p>
<p>palliate anything that I have done. I am re.idy to
</p>
<p>re-assert in court all I have said, not taking upon
</p>
<p>myself the clumsy mistakes of reporters  not abid-
</p>
<p>ing by the fallibility that necessarily attends the
</p>
<p>reporting of speeches, and, in particular, where
</p>
<p>those speeches are squeezed up together, as it were,
</p>
<p>for the purposes of the newspapers. I don't hesitate
</p>
<p>to say that there are many, several harsh things of
</p>
<p>individuals and clumsy jokes that I would rather
</p>
<p>not have said, but the substance of what I have said

<p>I avow, and I am here respectfully to vindicate it ;
</p>
<p>and as to all my .actions I am ready not only to avow

<p>out what was really the question to determine.
</p>
<p>Let me now see whether I can help you in that. I
</p>
<p>will endeavour to see how much of the affirmative
</p>
<p>there is in this prosecution, and how much there is
</p>
<p>of negative quality in it  that is, what it is, and
</p>
<p>what it is not. The entire strength of this prose-
</p>
<p>cution consists in that cabalistic word, ' ' conspiracy. "
</p>
<p>m look to any dictionary for its import, or if I ask
</p>
<p>common sense, I find it means a secret agreement
</p>
<p>among several to commit a crime. That is the
</p>
<p>common sense view of it, as well as its dictionary
</p>
<p>meaning. A private agreement among several to
</p>
<p>commit a crime ; but this word in recent times was
</p>
<p>taken under the special protection of the bar. They
</p>
<p>have not only considered it an ofience to conspire
</p>

<p>into a line  so to divide the subject as botli com-
</p>
<p>mittal of crime  that they spell out "conspiracy" in
</p>
<p>Buch a way as to attain that end. I do not think
</p>
<p>there is much of justice in the second brancli, if at
</p>
<p>all brought into consideration, unless it was so clear
</p>
<p>and so distinct as to substantiate the offence. We
</p>
<p>will now take this conspiracy  let us see whether
</p>
<p>there are any negative qualities in it as to the evi-
</p>
<p>dence produced by the crown. It is admitted by
</p>
<p>the crown itself in this case, that there was no pri-
</p>
<p>vacy  no secrecy  no definite agreement whatever
</p>
<p>to bring it about  but, above all, there was no pri-
</p>
<p>vate agreement, no secret society, nothing concealed,
</p>
<p>nothing even privately communicated.  there was
</p>
<p>no private information ; nay, not one private

<p>Dublin Evening Mail or Dublin Evening Post, for all
</p>
<p>has been raked out of that secret abyss of all secret
</p>
<p>channels of communication, the public newspapers.
</p>
<p>Really, it is quite too harsh a thing for one to be
</p>
<p>called on to defend himself against a conspiracy so
</p>
<p>perpetrated, committed in open day, and committed
</p>
<p>ty public announcement, with the ringing of bell,
</p>
<p>to know who would come as witnesses to the ton-
</p>
<p>Bplracy. To be a conspiracy there must be an
</p>
<p>agreement ; but whether private or not that is an-
</p>
<p>other question, but I insist on it there ought to be
</p>
<p>somethmg to conceal, and will admit that it should
</p>
<p>not be in the presence of the legal authorities, nor
</p>
<p>in the presence of her Majesty's Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>the Solicitor-General, or any of the learned ser-
</p>
<p>geants. Really, see what a monstrous thing it is to
</p>
<p>call that a conspiracy which everybody in the world
</p>
<p>might know, and which all might witness. Some
</p>
<p>persons had formed the arrangements ; it was occa-
</p>
<p>sionally attended by Mr. Such-a-one one day, and
</p>
<p>ty Mr. Such-a-one another day ; on the third day
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett was there ; Mr. IJuffy once or twice,
</p>
<p>thus spelling out the affair in that way. In common
</p>
<p>sense, could it be endured that such should be de-
</p>
<p>nominated a conspiracy ? A conspiracy 1 Where
</p>
<p>Was this agreement made  when made how was it
</p>
<p>made ? Was it made in winter or in summer  in
</p>
<p>spring or in autumn ? When was it attended on a
</p>
<p>Sunday or on a week-day ? Can you tell me the
</p>
<p>hour of the day, or the month, or the day of the
</p>
<p>month? Can you tell me any one of the three
</p>
<p>quarters of the nine months ? Who was by who

</p>
<p>the jury, one who had been a juryman in the case
</p>
<p>was in the hahit of attending, and when his health
</p>
<p>was drunk always made the same speech, to the
</p>
<p>effect that he was not accustomed to public speak-
</p>
<p>ing, and in the course of such speech he would
</p>
<p>say" Mr. Chairman, I will tell you why I ac-
</p>
<p>quitted Mr. Hardy. The counsel was eleven hours
</p>
<p>stating the case ; there were eight or nine days oc-
</p>
<p>cupied in giving evidence. Now I knew that no
</p>
<p>man could be guilty of treason when the ca.se could
</p>
<p>take so many words and such a length of time to
</p>
<p>prove, so I made \ip my mind to acquit." Now,
</p>
<p>what necessity could there be for the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General to ransack newspapers to make out a case
</p>
<p>of conspiracy against the crown ? K the case were
</p>
<p>a good one, depend on it the Attorney-General has
</p>
<p>talent enough to tell you all in one hour and a half
</p>
<p>at the utmost. Give me leave to say and by what
</p>
<p>1 am about to state I mean to signify no disrespect
</p>
<p>to the counsel for the crown  I consider myself, al-
</p>
<p>though I am not here with my wig and gown, a
</p>
<p>barrister still, and I have a fellow-feeling for the pro-
</p>
<p>fession ; but give me leave to say that the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General unquestionably would, could he have done
</p>
<p>so, have shown you the when, the how, the manner 
</p>
<p>he would have pointed out all the particulars. Sut
</p>
<p>What has he shown you? Nothing; and he leaves
</p>
<p>the case in your hands, thinking that it is quite
</p>
<p>good enough for you. There is no privacy or se-
</p>
<p>crecy even imputed. You have nothing to conjec-
</p>
<p>ture there is notliing to suppose that happened in
</p>
<p>private  nothing at all. The entire is before you,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, as you knew all, I say that there
</p>
<p>never was a case in which the Attorney- General so

<p>signally failed as in the present. You may remem-
</p>
<p>ber when this trial was about to commence ; the
</p>
<p>whole country was full of rumours. It was said that
</p>
<p>something dark and atrocious would come out that
</p>
<p>there was a clue to everything. Why, my lords, I
</p>
<p>do solemnly assure you that no less than seven gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen have been pointed out to me after this mode
</p>
<p>there is Mr. So-and-so, one who was seen with
</p>
<p>Mr. Kemmis's officer. That man was at the Cas-
</p>
<p>tle  that man is a barrister, whose office is not tar
</p>
<p>distant from yours in Merrion-square. " Don't,"
</p>
<p>it was said, " associate with Mr. So-and-so ; keep
</p>
<p>him at arm's length ; he is treacherous ; he is be-
</p>
<p>trayed." I repeat it, that no less than seven per-
</p>
<p>sons have suffered in their characters exceedingly
</p>
<p>by the allegation that they were in fault ; the an-
</p>
<p>swer was  " they have nothing to betray them 
</p>
<p>much good may it do them; they will invent."
</p>
<p>Now, it is an acknowledged fact, that informers who
</p>
<p>hare nothing to tell  invent. Now, I ask, after all
</p>
<p>the rumours which have been afloat, did you not,
</p>
<p>every one of you, expect, when you came here, to
</p>
<p>learn something  did j-ou not expect to have some
</p>
<p>plot discovered  to hear of some secret imagina-
</p>
<p>tion  to hear some private conversation regarding
</p>
<p>these traversers given in evidence, influencing and
</p>
<p>altering the nature of their public acts ? If you
</p>
<p>were so fortunate as not to expect this, you certainly
</p>
<p>have not been disappointed ; but if you entertained
</p>
<p>the expectation, was ever disappointment so com-
</p>
<p>plete and unmitigated ? Go where you please, and
</p>
<p>you will hear it said, " Oh ! is that all the Attorney-

<p>We knew all that before." A conspiracy 1 tliis is a

<p>it that I fell into a conspiracy as a man falls into a
</p>
<p>pit might without knowing it was there. This was
</p>
<p>in the open day. 1 saw the pitfall. Every thing
</p>
<p>was clear, and if you believe any thing against me
</p>
<p>you must believe I was a conspirator without know-

<p>ing it  .1 conspirator ignorant of conspiracy  and
</p>
<p>that is the question you are selected to try. In tlie
</p>
<p>technicality of law, 1 would say that even in that
</p>
<p>case there could be no guilt, for there can be no guilt
</p>
<p>without guilty intention ; but I scorn to make points
</p>
<p>of law  as a matter of common sense tliis is plain
</p>
<p>and obvious, and I trust I may say irresistible.
</p>
<p>Oh I this is a curious invention  this sweeping con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of tlie Attorney-General ; it has been so
</p>
<p>powerfully put to you already tliat I shall not repeat
</p>
<p>it at any length  that there would be an end to
</p>
<p>every great movement for the amelioration of human
</p>
<p>institutions if you were to concede to the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General a conspiracy which has neither been stated
</p>
<p>nor proved. It is a new invention made at this side
</p>
<p>of the water. Some exceedingly sagacious person
</p>
<p>here first dreamed of it; and you were to be put as
</p>
<p>it were into a sleep with this incubus  this imagi-
</p>
<p>nary conspiracy  conspiracy resting on your con-

</p>
<p>their aggregate meetings  they had their private
</p>
<p>meeeings ; they published the guilt of the West
</p>
<p>India planters, and the cruelty of the slave-owners ;
</p>
<p>they made themselves bitter, unrelenting enemies
</p>
<p>by so doing; for it is astonishing how much malig-
</p>
<p>nity arises from that inherent, unhappy propensity
</p>
<p>in man for power and authority. There never was
</p>
<p>a more formidable party than that which was ar-
</p>
<p>rayed against the slave-owners. They might have
</p>
<p>looked in the newspapers, and found every species
</p>
<p>of guilt charged against them by Wilberforce and
</p>
<p>others. Why was not Wilberforce charged with
</p>
<p>conspiracy ? That man who wrote his name on
</p>
<p>pages of the most brilliant history and humanities
</p>
<p>of men  who will be revered as long as worth, gene-
</p>
<p>rosity, and piety, are in the world. Oh ! he might
</p>
<p>.have stood, as the humble individual before you
</p>
<p>stands, accused of conspiracy, because he sought to
</p>
<p>put an end to the thraldom of the slave. The vene-
</p>
<p>rable Clarkson, who is still alive, might also be
</p>
<p>charged with conspiracy, and thus rendered unsafe
</p>
<p>, in his honoured old age. Ah 1 gentlemen, do not
</p>
<p>.presume to interfere between humanity and its
</p>
<p>resources. Do not venture to arrest the progress
</p>
<p>of any movement for the amelioration of the insti-
</p>
<p>tutions of the country. IJo not attempt to take aw^iy
</p>
<p>from your fellow-subjects the legitimate mode of
</p>
<p>effecting useful purposes by public meetings, public

</p>
<p>Shut not men up in dark corners  drive them not
</p>
<p>into concealment  send them not back into conspi-

<p>name of Wilberforce and Clarkson I conjure you to

<p>dismiss from your box with honest and zealous in-

</p>
<p>market for labour. 1 do not mean to argue the
</p>
<p>point with you ; we have enough of our own. They
</p>
<p>have lield many meetings  they liave used the bold-
</p>
<p>est language, and the Rev. Mr. Fisher has accused
</p>
<p>them of inciting to assassination and incendiarism.
</p>
<p>We are free from that accusation  we arc free from
</p>
<p>the slightest imputation  and is this case to be sent
</p>
<p>over to England to put down that glorious struggle?
</p>
<p>and is the attempt to give cheap bread to the poor
</p>
<p>to be turned into a conspiracy? Oh, no, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>no ; the English are safe in the glorious integrity of
</p>
<p>their jury-box  there won't be a single juryman
</p>
<p>sworn to try them who differs with them in opinion 
</p>
<p>there won't be a juryman sworn who even differed
</p>
<p>with violence upon any principle with the traversers.
</p>
<p>No ; tlie Englislimen are safe  I was wrong in say-
</p>
<p>ing they were in danger  tlie Englishmen are safe
</p>
<p>in the protection of their jury-box  and do you,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, protect us as the English protect them.
</p>
<p>Indeed, it is manifest, if tlie Attorney-General tri-
</p>
<p>umphs in this case, no great grievance can be re-
</p>
<p>dressed. When authority and power are interested,
</p>
<p>it requires a more cogent argument than justice to
</p>
<p>obtain relief, and it is only obtained by the power of
</p>
<p>public demonstration, and the accumulated weight
</p>
<p>of public opinion. A French author says  I do not
</p>
<p>quote him as an authority, for no man hates French
</p>
<p>infidelity and French republican opinions more than
</p>
<p>I do; but a French author says that " Vou cannot
</p>
<p>make a revolution with rose water." He would
</p>
<p>make it with blood  I would make it with public
</p>
<p>opinion, and 1 would put a little Irish spirit in it
</p>
<p>But I come to the menngerie of evidence which sus-
</p>
<p>tains this case. I told you there were two classes of

</p>
<p>evidence  if I am not wrong in using the words
</p>
<p>monster meetings and newspaper publications  ^we
</p>
<p>will take each of them. I am not here to deny that
</p>
<p>these meetings took place. I atlmit that they were held.
</p>
<p>I admit that the people attended them in hundreds
</p>
<p>and hundreds of thousands, but it has been said that
</p>
<p>the magnitude of these meetings would alone make
</p>
<p>them illegal. I do not discuss that question. I do
</p>
<p>not give it weight enough to do so. But I again
</p>
<p>admit that they took place, and I will ask you was
</p>
<p>any life lost at any of those meetings? Yuu will
</p>
<p>answer no not one ! Was any man, woman, or
</p>
<p>child injured? You will answer no! unanimously
</p>
<p>no ! Did an accident happen to any living thing so
</p>
<p>as to injure it in the slightest degree? Was there
</p>
<p>a single female, young or old, exposed to the slight-
</p>
<p>est indelicacy ? Was there one shilling's worth of
</p>
<p>property destroyed at any one of those meetings ?
</p>
<p>You answer no, unanimously no! Oh, but I forgot
</p>
<p> there was a policeman iu coloured clothes who de-
</p>
<p>scribed a ferocious .assault made by the people com-
</p>
<p>ing in from Carlow, which very nearly overturned
</p>
<p>the gingerbread and .appla stands of the old women
</p>
<p>(laughter)  and the amount of violence perpetrated
</p>
<p>was the overturning of some gingerbread stands. If
</p>
<p>there had been any violence committed would we not
</p>
<p>have heard of it ?  would it not have been proved by
</p>
<p>the policemen or magistrates who attended ? Oh,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, it is ridiculou.'  that is, it is the prose-
</p>
<p>cutions which are so. There was no violence, no
</p>
<p>battery, no assault, no injury to property, not the
</p>
<p>least violation of morality, or even of good manner.^.
</p>
<p>Not one accident happened at one of those meet-
</p>
<p>ings; not even a casual ajcident; and if I incited

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>could have been by nothing but design, when you
</p>
<p>accumulate the number, that the same peaceful de-
</p>
<p>meanour prevailed at all of them. The government
</p>
<p>knew of them, wliy was not their illegality previously
</p>
<p>imputed to them, if it existed ? I am not one of those
</p>
<p>who would insinuate or say that the Attorney -Gene-
</p>
<p>ral meant to iirge them into criminality, in order that
</p>
<p>he might pounce upon them. I say no such thing  I
</p>
<p>would do him more justice. He did not previously in-
</p>
<p>terfere, because there were no grounds for a prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion  there was nothing to warrant his interference.
</p>
<p>That is his defence. And I do not attach any crimi-
</p>
<p>nality to him for not having interfered with them be-
</p>
<p>fore. [Mr. O'Connell here had a short conversation
</p>
<p>with Mr. Slieil, after which the learned gentleman re-
</p>
<p>sumed.] I am told that I used an equivocal word 
</p>
<p>Isaid that those meetings were quiet by design. I
</p>
<p>repent it. The design pre-existed long before one
</p>
<p>of then\ were held  the design to be quiet and
</p>
<p>peaceable existed, and it will continue to exist.
</p>
<p>There was no such arrangement for any particular
</p>
<p>meeting. That was the education which I spoke of
</p>
<p>the Irish people having received  the education
</p>
<p>that the only certain way to establish their rights,
</p>
<p>and to obtiiin valuable amelioration and free institu-
</p>
<p>tions, was by peaceable conduct and obedience to
</p>
<p>the laws, I ask you, gentlemen, what evidence is
</p>
<p>there of a conspiracy from what has passed at any
</p>
<p>of these meetings ? I leave it to your conscience 
</p>
<p>to your integrity, to answer the question. What care
</p>
<p>I what your politics are  you'll answer before your
</p>
<p>Maker for the verdict you pronounce  I leave the
</p>
<p>responsibility to you. This is one part of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and the next is the publications in the

<p>newspapers. Do not imagine I am going to detain
</p>
<p>you in canvassing all the phrases and sentences
</p>
<p>that have appeared in these papers. I am not.
</p>
<p>You have been powerfully addressed on that topic
</p>
<p>already. I shall take up the general nature of the
</p>
<p>evidence of those newspapers, from which you are
</p>
<p>called upon to fabricate a conspiracy. I submit
</p>
<p>that, with the exception of what is proved to have
</p>
<p>been delivered by me, the evidence of these news-
</p>
<p>papers is no evidence against me, unless the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is first proved. And see what a circle that
</p>
<p>would lead you into. Are you to find the evidence
</p>
<p>of conspiracy from the newsp.apers ? The news-
</p>
<p>papers are no evirlence against me unless I be first
</p>
<p>proved to be a conspirator. Be that as it may, I
</p>
<p>shall leave it to the court as a matter of l,iw, but I
</p>
<p>leave to you the weight, the worth of the evidence,
</p>
<p>shall that evidence go to you at all. Suppose it does,
</p>
<p>whatis there in it against me?  what is its substan-
</p>
<p>tial weight against me? Is there any proof that I ever
</p>
<p>saw one of those newspapers ? Is there any proof of any
</p>
<p>connection between me and those newspapers? Itwill
</p>
<p>appear by the dates that when some of the harshest
</p>
<p>passages in them were printed I was not in town 
</p>
<p>I was attending these meetings in the country, and
</p>
<p>jt was moved that at the association I 'distinctly
</p>
<p>disavowed that any newspaper was the organ of

<p>St. But it is said that we circulated those news-
</p>
<p>papers. See what the fact is. Those who sub-
</p>
<p>scribed a ceitain amount allocated a portion of it,
</p>
<p>according to our rules, to the purchase of a news-
</p>
<p>paper, and they were entitled to any paper they
</p>
<p>might select. The evidence is not that we selected
</p>
<p>any newspaper for them, but they ordered any one

</p>
<p>an appeal to physical force, in case other means

<p>movement in favour of Catholic emancipation ; and
</p>
<p>it was by a rigid adherence to that principle that I
</p>
<p>conducted the movement to a glorious and trium-

<p>was obtained without violence and bloodshed ; and
</p>
<p>is it fair, I ask you, gentlemen, that you should be

<p>called upon at this hour of the day to interrupt a

<p>man who has laid that down as the basis of his

</p>
<p>participator in conspiracy the man who has been
</p>
<p>preaching peace, law, and order during his whole
</p>
<p>life, and lias invariably deprecated and denounced
</p>
<p>the idea that the objects of his political life were to
</p>
<p>be attained by an appeal to violent means? Gen-

<p>ber of my own religious persuasion there would be
</p>
<p>no necessity for my impressing this fact upon your

<p>minds, for he could tell you that he professed that

</p>
<p>I have studiously endeavoured to model my political

<p>conduct according to the standard of that maxim of

<p>my religious belief, and, therefore, should you now

<p>be called upon to do your judgment and common

<p>sense the violence of believing that I could proclaim

<p>one thing and practice another, I fearlessly assert
</p>
<p>that there is no circumstance of my life, from my
</p>
<p>birth to the present hour, which can warrant you in
</p>
<p>doubting the sincerity of ray professions. It will
</p>
<p>appear from reference to the newspapers that have
</p>
<p>been given in evidence  and even though there were
</p>
<p>no newspapers, the fact is so notorious as to admit
</p>
<p>of no dispute  that no man ever possessed so much
</p>
<p>of the confidence of the Irish people as I. No man
</p>
<p>enjoyed it so unremittingly, and in so large a degree.
</p>
<p>I have obtained the confidence of all classes of the
</p>
<p>Catholic laity  and not of the poor Catholics alone
</p>
<p>whose condition might be ameliorated by any change,
</p>
<p>but of the middle and higher classes also. I haVe
</p>
<p>also the honour of enjoying the confidence of the
</p>
<p>Catholic clergy, and the Catholic episcopacy, and to
</p>
<p>what am I to attribute the possession of their good
</p>
<p>graces unless to the assertion of this principle and
</p>
<p>to the unswerving fidelity with which, through all
</p>
<p>the vicissitudes of my political life, I have invaria-
</p>
<p>bly adhered to it ? How long could I possess their
</p>
<p>confidence it I were the base deceiver I am pictured ?

<p>any opposition. I have allowed the experiment to
</p>
<p>be tried, and those who were most inimical before
</p>
<p>have avowed that I was right, and they were wrong,
</p>
<p>and I am ready to ameliorate it. and assist its work-
</p>
<p>ing if I can. Gentlemen, you also recollect it is
</p>
<p>given in evidence the manner of my answer to young
</p>
<p>Mr. Tyler's speech and letter  you saw from tliiit
</p>
<p>and from the speech given in evidence by Mr. Bond
</p>
<p>Hughes; and now, my lords, as I have mentioned
</p>
<p>that name, I think it right to say that as I was one
</p>
<p>of those convinced that that gentleman had wilfully
</p>
<p>sworn what was not true, I am glad to have men-
</p>
<p>tioned his name, because it aflords me an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity I am proud to take of stating that I never saw
</p>
<p>a witness on the table who gave his evidence more
</p>
<p>fairly than Mr. Bond Hughes, and I am thoroughly
</p>
<p>convinced that the contradiction in his eviilence was
</p>
<p>a mistake that any honest man might fall into. It
</p>
<p>is not part of this case, but I am sure your lordships
</p>
<p>don't think me wrong in making this public avowal.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it appears by his report also how em-
</p>
<p>phatically I informed the Americans that we were
</p>
<p>anxious for sympathy from them, but that we would
</p>
<p>take no part, in the slightest degree, disparaging of
</p>
<p>our allegiance. Rut that is put still more strongly
</p>
<p>when you recollect the denunciations I made of the
</p>
<p>American slave-owners. Large sums of money were
</p>
<p>sent from the American slave-holding stales the
</p>
<p>remittances were in progress money was in pro-
</p>
<p>gress of collection in Charleston, Carolina; but did
</p>
<p>1 mitigate my tone, or moderate my language in
</p>
<p>condemning the principle of slavery ? Did I not
</p>
<p>denounce the slave-owners as enemies of God and of
</p>
<p>man  as culprits and criminals ? Did I not compare

</p>
<p>ing the speech alluded to. When I spoke I made
</p>
<p>the distinction between the minister and the Sove-
</p>
<p>reign, and I say there is not a particle or taint of
</p>
<p>disloyalty in the observations I made. I answered
</p>
<p>that speech, not as the speech of the Queen, but of
</p>
<p>the minister of the day, and I say there is no taint of
</p>
<p>disloyalty in it. 1 am come to a time of life when
</p>
<p>she can do nothing for me ; and yet lam sure there
</p>
<p>is not a man in the court who could infer that I
</p>
<p>meant disloyalty. In one thing I think the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General did not act fair to me ; and it does aflSict
</p>
<p>me that I should be charged with disloyalty to the
</p>
<p>Sovereign in the manner he has sought to fasten it
</p>
<p>on me. In speaking of the ministry the word Judy
</p>
<p>occurred, and tlien the Attorney-General tells you I
</p>
<p>called the Queen a fishwonian. That speech had no
</p>
<p>reference to the Qneeu at all  don't believe it ; L feel
</p>
<p>angry at it. Thatspecch had reference to the minister
</p>
<p>alone, and to him I applied the term " Judy." and
</p>
<p>nothing else, and it is utterly false that I used the
</p>
<p>word to the Queen ; and I here disclaim, abjure, and
</p>
<p>disavow the man who would be capable of usingsuch
</p>
<p>language to the Sovereign. No matter what I may
</p>
<p>be accused of, I have never been accused of disloy-
</p>
<p>alty or disaffection to my Sovereign, and I repeat, I
</p>
<p>never did any such thing as the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>has stated to you. When I did use strong language,
</p>
<p>I have always distinguished between the Queen and
</p>
<p>her ministers. Gentlemen, 1 fear I have detained
</p>
<p>you rather longer on this point than I had intended,
</p>
<p>but I have to judge of my case by referring to you

<p>my public conduct which is fully before yon. I may

</p>
<p>long and ardent desire was breathed for the liberties
</p>
<p>of my country. Gentlemen, it was said the meet-
</p>
<p>ings, when they took place, had some object  so they
</p>
<p>had, the repeal of the union ? Was that a bad or
</p>
<p>injurious purpose? I deliberately say it was not;
</p>
<p>no, it was the most useful that could possibly be had
</p>
<p>for the benefit of this country. I say there is not a
</p>
<p>man in this court, the neutrality of the court alone
</p>
<p>excepted, that ought not to be a repealer, and I think
</p>
<p>before I sit down I will make you all repealers (loud
</p>
<p>laughter). I will show it is your duty to join the
</p>
<p>repeal cause, and then I am sure you will have
</p>
<p>pleasure in doing so (laughter). I mean, in the first
</p>
<p>place, to show you the destruction caused in this
</p>
<p>country by the English parliament that it had from
</p>
<p>the most remote period watched this country with a
</p>
<p>narrow jealousy. I will give you some evidence re-
</p>
<p>garding the woollen manufacturers of this country.
</p>
<p>It is a long time ago, and occurred in the reign of a
</p>
<p>king whose actions you are not inclined to condemn.
</p>
<p>I will show that the settlement of 1782 was to be a
</p>
<p>final (idjudication and establishment of the Irish
</p>
<p>parliament for ever. In the next place, I will show
</p>
<p>you the great prosperity of Ireland subsequent to
</p>
<p>that period. I will next show you that the union
</p>
<p>was founded in the grossest injustice and fraud  I
</p>
<p>will show you the distress that followed the union
</p>
<p>statute  1 will show you the ill-treatment of Ireland
</p>
<p>by England, which is a matter of history so well
</p>
<p>known, that I will not detain you on the point. Yet
</p>
<p>being brought here by the Attorney-General, my
</p>
<p>defence is, that I am not looking for what is injurious
</p>
<p>to the country, but for what would be of the greatest
</p>
<p>possible benefit to this country. I have a right to

</p>
<p>has not been either purchased or extorted by the
</p>
<p>virtue of your own parliament from the illiberality
</p>
<p>of England."
</p>
<p>In 179S, when a government pamphlet was first
</p>
<p>ptiblished by Mr. Secretary Cooke, which first
</p>
<p>broached the subject of the repeal of the union,
</p>
<p>he says: 
</p>
<p>" A union was the only means of preventing Ire-
</p>
<p>land from growing too great and too powerful." At
</p>
<p>the same time admitting  "When one nation is
</p>
<p>coerced to unite with another, such union savours
</p>
<p>of subjection."
</p>
<p>I will quote again from Lord Chief Justice Bushe.
</p>
<p>In denouncing England's intolerance of Ireland's
</p>
<p>prosperity, during the debates on the union, he
</p>
<p>used the follnwing language :  " I strip this for-
</p>
<p>midable measure of all its pretensions and all its
</p>
<p>aggravations ; I look on it nakedly and abstract-
</p>
<p>edly, and I see nothing in it but one question  will
</p>
<p>you give up the country ? I forget for a moment
</p>
<p>the unprincipled means by which it has been pro-
</p>
<p>rtioted  I pass by for a moment the unseasonable
</p>
<p>time at which it has been introduced, and the con-
</p>
<p>tempt of parliament upon which it is bottomed, and
</p>
<p>I look upon it simply as England reclaiming, in a
</p>
<p>moment of your weakness, that dominion which
</p>
<p>you extorted from her in a moment of your virtue 
</p>
<p>a dominion which she uniformly abused  which in-
</p>
<p>variably oppressed and impoverished you, and from
</p>
<p>the cessation of which you date all your prosperity.
</p>
<p>It is a measure which goes to degrade the country,
</p>
<p>by saying it is unfit to govern herself, and to stul-
</p>
<p>tify the parliament by saying it is incapable of
</p>
<p>governing the country. It is the revival of the

<p>odious and absurd title of conquest ; it is the re-
</p>
<p>newal of the abominable distinction between mother
</p>
<p>country and colony which lost America ; it is the
</p>
<p>denial of the rights of nature to a great nation
</p>
<p>from an intolerance of its prosperity."
</p>
<p>From the commencement I told you I would prove
</p>
<p>that it was hatred of the prosperity of Ireland ; and
</p>
<p>if he who uttered that opinion were here to-day he
</p>
<p>would avow it. These topics were almost forgotten,
</p>
<p>and I am obliged to the Attorney-General for having
</p>
<p>reminded me of them. I will read another docu-
</p>
<p>ment to prove that the English policy has always
</p>
<p>been against the amalgamation of the Irish people.
</p>
<p>It is an e.\tract from a letter from Primate Boulter
</p>
<p>to the Duke of Newcastle, which is dated Dublin,
</p>
<p>January 9th, 1724:.^
</p>
<p>" I have made it my business to talk with several
</p>
<p>of the most leading men in parliament, and have
</p>
<p>employed others to pick up what they could learn
</p>
<p>from a variety of people; and I feel by my own and
</p>
<p>others' inquiry that the people of every religion,
</p>
<p>country, and party here, are alike set against
</p>
<p>Wood's halfpence, and that their agreement in this
</p>
<p>has had a very unhappy influence on the state of
</p>
<p>this nation, by bringing on intimacies between Pa-
</p>
<p>pists and Jacobites, and the Whigs, who before
</p>
<p>had no correspondence with them : so 'tis ques-
</p>
<p>tioned whether (if there were occasion) the justices
</p>
<p>of the peace could be found who would be strict in
</p>
<p>disarming the Papists."
</p>
<p>Mark, gentlemen, the paternal feeling of the go-
</p>
<p>vernment of that day. " It spurned, as an ' un-
</p>
<p>happy influence,' the intimacy between the Papists
</p>
<p>and Whigs." Gentlemen, have I not now proved

</p>
<p>from Great Britain in 1797, very little exceeded one
</p>
<p>million sterling (the articles of produce amount to
</p>
<p>nearly the same sum) ; whilst Great Britain, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, imported from Ireland to the amount of
</p>
<p>more than three millions in the manufacture of linen
</p>
<p>and linen yarn, and between two and three millions
</p>
<p>in provisions and cattle, besides corn and other arti-
</p>
<p>cles of produce." That, said Mr. Pitt, was in 1785
</p>
<p> three years after her legislative independence 
</p>
<p>that was the state of Ireland. Have you heard,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, that picture, that description? You
</p>
<p>have heard that proof of the prosperity of Ireland.
</p>
<p>She then imported little more than one million's
</p>
<p>vorth of English manufacture ; she exported two and
</p>
<p>a lialf millions of linen and linen yarn, and adding to
</p>
<p>that the million of other exports, there is a picture
</p>
<p>i,^iven of her internal prosperity. EecoUect that
</p>
<p>.'e DOW import largely English manufactures, and
</p>
<p>tha; the greatest part of the price of those manufac-
</p>
<p>tures consists of the wages which the manufacturer
</p>
<p>give 1 to the persons who manufacture them. Two
</p>
<p>m-.ilions five hundred thousand worth of linen and
</p>
<p>It len yarn were exported, and one million of other
</p>
<p>gOiDilo. Compare that with the present state of
</p>
<p>things. Does not everyone of you know that there
</p>
<p>is scarcely anything now manufactured in Ireland
</p>
<p>that nearly all the manufactures used in Ireland
</p>
<p>are imported from England ? I am now showing
</p>
<p>the state of Irish prosperity at the time I am talking
</p>
<p>of. I gave you the authority of Forster (no small
</p>
<p>one) and of Pitt, of Irish prosperity during that
</p>
<p>time. I will give you the authority of another man
</p>
<p>that was not very friendly to the people of this

<p>country  that of Lord Clare. Lord Clare made a

<p>speech in 1798, which he subsequently published,
</p>
<p>and in which I find this remarkable passage, to which
</p>
<p>I beg leave to direct your particular attention : 
</p>
<p>" There is not," said his lordship, " a nation on the
</p>
<p>face of the habitable globe which has advanced in
</p>
<p>cultivation, in agriculture, in manutactures, with
</p>
<p>the same rapidity, in the same period, as Ireland"
</p>
<p>(viz., from 1782 to 1798). That was the way in
</p>
<p>which Irish legislative independence worked, and I
</p>
<p>have in support of it the evidence of Pitt, Forster,
</p>
<p>and Lord Clare ; and Lord Grey, in 1799, talking
</p>
<p>of Scotland in the same years, says  " In truth, for
</p>
<p>a period of more than forty years after the (Scotch)
</p>
<p>union, Scotland exhibited no proofs of increased in-
</p>
<p>dustry and rising wealth." Lord Grey, in continu-
</p>
<p>ation, stated that  " Till after 1748 there was no
</p>
<p>sensible advance of the commerce of Scotland. Se-
</p>
<p>veral of her manufactures were not established till
</p>
<p>sixty years after the union, and her principal branch
</p>
<p>of manufacture was not set up, I believe, till 1781.
</p>
<p>The abolition of the heritable jurisdictions was the
</p>
<p>first great measure that gave an impulse to the spirit
</p>
<p>of improvement in Scotland. Since that time the
</p>
<p>prosperity of Scotland has been considerable, but
</p>
<p>certainly not so great as that of Ireland has been
</p>
<p>within the same period." Lord Plunket, in his
</p>
<p>speech in 1799, in one of his happiest efforts of
</p>
<p>oratory, speaks of her as of " a little island with a
</p>
<p>population of four or five millions of people, hardy,
</p>
<p>gallant, and enthusiastic  possessed of all the means
</p>
<p>of civilisation, agriculture, and commerce, well pur-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>of Dublin held a meeting on the 18th of December,
</p>
<p>1798, at which they passed the following resolu-
</p>
<p>tions : ' Resolved That since the renunciation of
</p>
<p>the power of Great Britain, in 1782, to legislate for
</p>
<p>Ireland, the commerce and prosperity of this king-
</p>
<p>dom have eminently increased." " Resolved 
</p>
<p>That we attribute these blessings, under Providence,
</p>
<p>to the wisdom of the Irish parliament."
</p>
<p>The Guild of Merchants met on the 14th January,
</p>
<p>1799, and passed a resolution declaring  " That tlie
</p>
<p>commerce of Ireland has increased and her manu-
</p>
<p>factures improved beyond example, since the inde-
</p>
<p>pendence of this kingdom was restored by the exer-
</p>
<p>tions of our countrymen in 1782.
</p>
<p>" Resolved  That we look with abhorrence on
</p>
<p>any attempt to deprive the people of Ireland of their
</p>
<p>parliament, and thereby of their constitutional right
</p>
<p>and immediate power to legislate for themselves."
</p>
<p>I have, in addition to these, from the most un-
</p>
<p>questionable authority (an autliority incapable of
</p>
<p>deceiving or of being deceived) the relative increase
</p>
<p>in England and Ireland of the consumption of tea,
</p>
<p>tobacco, wine, sugar, and coffee, firom 178o to the
</p>
<p>union, which is as follows : 
</p>
<p>Tea Increase in Ireland 84 per cent.
</p>
<p>Increase in England 45 per cent.
</p>
<p>From 1786 to the union :
</p>
<p>Tobacco... Increase in Ireland 100 per cent.
</p>
<p>Increase in England 64 per cent.
</p>
<p>From 1787 to the union :
</p>
<p>Wine Increase in Ireland 74 per cent.
</p>
<p>Increase in England 22 per cent.
</p>
<p>From 1785 to the union :
</p>
<p>Sugar Increase in Ireland 57 per cent.

</p>
<p>Increase in England 75 per cent.

<p>I could multiply quotations. What need have I for

<p>60 doing ? I have proved that no country on the
</p>
<p>face of the earth ever increased so rapidly in pros-
</p>
<p>perity, as Ireland did from 1800 to the union.

<p>There is a cant phrase used for want of argument

<p>against us repealers  " you wish for dismember-
</p>
<p>ment of the empire." Reflect for one moment on

<p>the absurdity of saying this. Ireland, under her
</p>
<p>own parliament, with her own legislature, increased
</p>
<p>in prosperity to the incalculable extent I have
</p>
<p>shown. Is it possible to believe that that increase
</p>
<p>in prosperity would have had the least tendency to
</p>
<p>the dismemberment of the empire, or separation from
</p>
<p>England ? She was increasing in prosperity during
</p>
<p>the connection  she was increasing in prosperity
</p>
<p>during that period of legislative independence  why
</p>
<p>should she, then, think of dismemberment? I can un-
</p>
<p>derstand the term as applied to a period in which trade
</p>
<p>was declining  in which the consumption of the
</p>
<p>articles I have mentioned greatly diminished  I can
</p>
<p>understand the term dismemberment, as applied to
</p>
<p>poverty and destitution, but it is absurd to talk
</p>
<p>about dismemberment, as applicable to a period when
</p>
<p>there was an increase in prosperity, such as Ireland
</p>
<p>experienced under her own parliament again. Is it
</p>
<p>not melancholy to think that such an opening scene
</p>
<p>as that to which I have directed your attention
</p>
<p>should have been closed at once ? It really afflicts
</p>
<p>me to reflect that there should have existed  should
</p>
<p>I call him a monster  to disturb such increasing
</p>
<p>prosperity to gain dominion, and actually, to use

</p>
<p>Such, gentlemen, is the description given of the
</p>
<p>means by which the union was carried. You know
</p>
<p>how much money was spent in the purchase of rot-
</p>
<p>ten boroughs. You know that three millions were
</p>
<p>expended in the actual payment of persons who
</p>
<p>voted for the union. You know that there was no
</p>
<p>office in the state, no office from the highest in the
</p>
<p>church to the lowest in the constabulary, that was
</p>
<p>not used to gain the desired purpose. There was
</p>
<p>more fraud, corruption, and iniquity employed in
</p>
<p>the carrying of the union, than perhaps ever accom-
</p>
<p>panied any public transaction, lou will easily
</p>
<p>imagine the result. The union has been destructive
</p>
<p>to Ireland ; you feel this yourselves ; you see it by
</p>
<p>the state of your streets ; you know it by the posi-
</p>
<p>tion of your commerce. Having shown you the
</p>
<p>general spirit of the English government  having
</p>
<p>adverted to the finality as intended as the treaty of
</p>
<p>178'2  having shown you the extreme advantages
</p>
<p>and prosperity of Ireland from the independence of
</p>
<p>her own parliament  having shown you the means
</p>
<p>by which the union was carried, I come now to de-
</p>
<p>tain you for as short a time as possible by a reference
</p>
<p>to the evil results of that measure. In the year
</p>
<p>1794 the Irish debt was only seven millions ; in the
</p>
<p>year 1798 it had increased to fourteen millions: 
</p>
<p>"About the year 1 794 the Irish debt was 7,000,000/. ;
</p>
<p>in the year 1798 the Irish debt was 14,000,000/. At

<p>the last-named period the English debt was, at least,

<p>The taxes repealed or remitted in Ireland being one
</p>
<p>twenty-sixth part of those repealed in Great Britain.
</p>
<p>From Finance Report of Public Expenditure, 18)5: 
</p>
<p>" That for several years Ireland has advanced in
</p>
<p>permanent taxation more rapidly than Great Britain
</p>
<p>itself, notwithstanding the immense exertions of the
</p>
<p>latter country, including the extraordinary and war
</p>
<p>taxes, the permanent revenue of Great Britain having
</p>
<p>increased from the year 1801 to the proportion of
</p>
<p>16J to 10; the whole revenue of Great Britain, in-
</p>
<p>cluding war taxes, as 21 J to 10 ; and the revenues
</p>
<p>of Ireland in the proportion of 23 to 10. But in the
</p>
<p>twenty-four years referred to your committee, the
</p>
<p>increase of Irish revenue has been in the proportion
</p>
<p>of 46| to 10 1 ! !' Session 1814-13, vol. 6.
</p>
<p>" The annual amount of taxes repealed in Eng-
</p>
<p>land since the peace is 47,214,338?., and the amount
</p>
<p>of taxes repealed in Ireland in the same period is
</p>
<p>1,575,940/., the taxes repealed or remitted in Ireland
</p>
<p>being one-thirtieth of those repealed or remitted in
</p>
<p>Great Britain (hear). Here is another table, com-
</p>
<p>posed of the same materials, and coming out of the
</p>
<p>same shop, makes the quantity repealed in England
</p>
<p>only 41,085,202/. but it leaves the quantity repealed
</p>
<p>in Ireland the same number as mentioned above or
</p>
<p>a little more  it makes it 1,584,21 1/."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, would thatoccurin an Irish parliament?
</p>
<p>K he was accused of making Ireland what she ought
</p>
<p>to be in commerce and manufactures, would he have
</p>
<p>disclaimed any such intention? And what must
</p>
<p>have been that spirit of parliament towards Ireland
</p>
<p>which made it necessary for a statesman to disclaim
</p>
<p>anything so atrocious, so outrageous, and so abo-
</p>
<p>minable as the intention of making Ireland the rival

<p>of England and Scotland ? You perceive from this
</p>
<p>the fatuity and folly of transferring the manage-
</p>
<p>ment of your affairs to a parliament wherein it was
</p>
<p>considered a reproach to make Ireland the equal of
</p>
<p>those countries, and how it is the imperative duty
</p>
<p>of every man who takes a part in politics to come
</p>
<p>forward and have a legislature which will not con
</p>
<p>eider it a reproach but a praise to endeavour to make
</p>
<p>Ireland the rival of every country in commerce and
</p>
<p>manufactures. This fact speaks trumpet-tongued,
</p>
<p>and with a voice that, I trust, will rouse you to just
</p>
<p>indignation against any attempt that may be made
</p>
<p>to put down the natural uprising  the peaceable
</p>
<p>and tranquil uprising  of the entire Irish people to
</p>
<p>obtain the benefit of a native parliament. There is
</p>
<p>a document here which I cannot avoid quoting for
</p>
<p>you: 
</p>
<p>" The enormous excess of British over Irish debt
</p>
<p>at the union left the British minister no excuse for
</p>
<p>their consolidation, and accordingly it was arranged
</p>
<p>that the two debts should continue to be separately
</p>
<p>provided for. The active expenditure of the empire
</p>
<p>(i. e. the expenditure clear of charge of debts) was
</p>
<p>to be provided for in the proportion of two parts
</p>
<p>from Ireland to fifteen for Great Britain. These
</p>
<p>proportions were to cease, the debts were to be con-
</p>
<p>solidated, and the two countries to contribute indis-
</p>
<p>criminately by equal taxes, so soon as the said re-
</p>
<p>spective debts should be hrought to bear to each
</p>
<p>other the proportions of the contributions  viz., as
</p>
<p>2 to 15 ; provided also that the fiscal ability of Ire-
</p>
<p>land should be found to have increased. Now, the
</p>
<p>2 to 15 rate of contribution was denounced at the
</p>
<p>time by Irishmen as too high for Ireland, and after-
</p>

</p>
<p>peerage, in reference to the atrocity committed
</p>
<p>against this country by the carrying of the act of
</p>
<p>union. I am sure there is not one of their de-
</p>
<p>scendants who do not glory that his ancestor signed
</p>
<p>that protest, and I trust we will soon have an op-
</p>
<p>portunity of seeing those descendants carrying the
</p>
<p>intentions of their ancestors into effect, and taking
</p>
<p>their seats in a parliament in College-green. Among
</p>
<p>other evils resulting from the union is the inade-
</p>
<p>quacy of the representation of Ireland, as contrasted
</p>
<p>with that of England, and in particular the infinitely
</p>
<p>less voice of the people of Ireland, by reason of the
</p>
<p>inadequacy of the register. Gentlemen, the follow-
</p>
<p>ing extract, which is of some length but great im-
</p>
<p>portance, will tend to show the injustice done to
</p>
<p>Ireland in the nominal union, by giving something
</p>
<p>like an adequate proportion of representatives to
</p>
<p>England, but denying to Ireland a similar advan-
</p>
<p>tage. I am anxious to read this now and cast it
</p>
<p>before the public, because there appears to be some-
</p>
<p>thing like a disposition to concede something on this
</p>
<p>point. Last year we were told there was a termi-
</p>
<p>nation to concession. This year we were told that
</p>
<p>something will be done in the extension of the par-
</p>
<p>liamentary franchise. You will see how necessary
</p>
<p>this is : 
</p>
<p>" The result of the injustice done to the people of
</p>
<p>Ireland by the restriction of the elective franchise
</p>
<p>is made manifest by a contrast between the popula-
</p>
<p>tion of the several counties in England, and the num-
</p>
<p>ber of registered voters therein, with the population
</p>
<p>and number of registered voters of the different Irish
</p>
<p>counties. We take our statement of numbers from
</p>
<p>the parliamentary papers, and by comparing the least

<p>populous counties in England with the most populous
</p>
<p>in Ireland  Westmoreland and Cork, for instance,
</p>
<p>we find the following result :  The rural population
</p>
<p>of Westmoreland is 43,464, and its number of regis-
</p>
<p>tered voters after the reform act amounted to 4,!i92,
</p>
<p>nearly one out of every ten inhabitants. Whereas,
</p>
<p>in the county of Cork the population is 703,716,
</p>
<p>and the number of electors registered afer the Irish
</p>
<p>reform act, was only 3,835, being scarcely one out
</p>
<p>of every two hundred of the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>" We ask, therefore, is this to be endured ?
</p>
<p>*' I may now mention the effect in particular lo-
</p>
<p>calities  in Wales the population is 800,01)0  in
</p>
<p>Cork the rural population is 713,716. How are they
</p>
<p>respectively represented in parliament ? Wales, with
</p>
<p>its 800,000 inhabitants, 28 members of parliament ;
</p>
<p>the county of Cork, with nearly the same popula-
</p>
<p>tion, has but two members of parliament : the
</p>
<p>county Mayo, with 400,000 inhabitants, has but
</p>
<p>two members of parliament ; Wales, with 800,000
</p>
<p>inhabitants  only double the number  has 28 mem-
</p>
<p>bers of parliament. The people of Ireland don't
</p>
<p>know these things, but I will take care they shall
</p>
<p>know it ; and I anticipate easily the result. I will
</p>
<p>just give another specimen :  I will take five coun-
</p>
<p>ties in each country to show you how the repre-
</p>
<p>sentation stands :  Cumberland, with a population
</p>
<p>of 126,681, has four members ; the county of Cork,
</p>
<p>with a population of 713,716, has but two members.
</p>
<p>Leicestershire, with a population of 197,276, has
</p>
<p>four members. Tipperary with a population of
</p>
<p>390,598, has but two members. Northampton, with
</p>
<p>1 population of 179,276, has four members. The

</p>
<p>and most commercial city in Ireland, with 53,000
</p>
<p>inhabitants, had only 1,926 electors.
</p>
<p>"The city of Cork, with 110,000 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>had only 3,650 electors, including the non-resident
</p>
<p>freemen, while Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with a popu-
</p>
<p>lation of 42,260 inhabitants, had 4,952 voters.
</p>
<p>Preston, with a population of 33,112 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>had 4,204 electors  both of them more than Cork,
</p>
<p>which last city has more than treble the number of
</p>
<p>inhabitants, of either of the other two ; and Bristol,
</p>
<p>with 104,338 inhabitants, not equal to the popula-
</p>
<p>tion of Cork, has 10,347 voters, being three times
</p>
<p>the constituency of the Irish city.
</p>
<p>" If, too, we compare the smaller boroughs in
</p>
<p>both countries together, we find that those which
</p>
<p>barely escaped schedule A. with populations vary-
</p>
<p>ing from 2 to 3,000 inhabitants, liave more electors
</p>
<p>than the boroughs in Ireland, retained by the act
</p>
<p>of union, with from 10 to 12,000 inhabitants.
</p>
<p>" For example, Wallinford, Launcestown, Ware-
</p>
<p>ham, Arundel, have all under 3,000 inhabitants,
</p>
<p>while the electoral constituencies in all exceed 300
</p>
<p>voters. However in Athlone and Bandon, with
</p>
<p>over 10,000 inhabitants in each, the voters do not
</p>
<p>exceed 250, and in many others, such as Kinsale,
</p>
<p>Coleraine, and New Ross, the available constituency
</p>
<p>falls far short of 200 voters.
</p>
<p>" If also we compare the metropolitan consti-
</p>
<p>tuencies of both countries, where an equality in
</p>
<p>household value may be expected, wp will find that
</p>
<p>Dublin, with a population of 210,000 inliabitants,
</p>
<p>had only 9,081 voters, including all the bad freemen

</p>
<p>inhabitants, had 18,584 electors, and only 17,315
</p>
<p>houses above 10/. value.
</p>
<p>" Nothing can more clearly illustrate the disadvan-
</p>
<p>tages under which the Irish cities labour, with re-
</p>
<p>spect to the 10/. household franchise, than the com-
</p>
<p>parison of the number of houses of 10/. a-year clear
</p>
<p>value in London, and the number of electors upon
</p>
<p>that qualification, with the number of similar houses
</p>
<p>in Dublin, and of similar electors.
</p>
<p>' These facts appear from parliamentary returns.
</p>
<p>The number of 10/. houses in the city of London are
</p>
<p>17,315, and the number of electors appear to be
</p>
<p>18,584 ; whilst in Dublin, the number of houses
</p>
<p>of 10/. value, according to Sherrard's valuation,
</p>
<p>amounted to 14, 105, while the number of electors
</p>
<p>only amount to 9,081. Thus in the city of London,
</p>
<p>there are more electors than 10/. householders,
</p>
<p>whereas in the city of Dublin the aggregate of
</p>
<p>electors does not amount to within one-third of the
</p>
<p>number of 10/. householders.

</p>
<p>ask your attention to a statement of the number of
</p>
<p>English and Scotchmen appointed to offices of the
</p>
<p>Btate in Ireland. I take it from the Mail. Let me
</p>
<p>first observe that the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland is
</p>
<p>an Englishman ; the Chief Secretary is an English-
</p>
<p>man ; the Lord Chancellor is an Englishman. The
</p>
<p>writer in the Mail proceeds, in answer to an ar-
</p>
<p>ticle in the London Times relative to this topic of
</p>
<p>complaint: 
</p>
<p>" The archbishop of Dublin is an Englishman ;
</p>
<p>the chief administrator of the Irish poor law is an
</p>
<p>Englishman ; the pnymaster of Irish civil services
</p>
<p>is a Scotchman ; the chief commissioner of Irish
</p>
<p>public works is an Englishman ; the teller of the
</p>
<p>Irish Exchequer is an Englishman ; the chief officer
</p>
<p>of the Irish constabulary is a Scotchman ; the chief
</p>
<p>officer of the Irish post-office is an Englishman ; the
</p>
<p>collector of excise is a Scotchman ; the head of the
</p>
<p>revenue police is an Englishman ; the second in
</p>
<p>command is a Scotchman ; the persons employed in
</p>
<p>the collection of the customs are English and Scotch,
</p>
<p>in the proportion of thirty-five to one.
</p>
<p>" But the Times may perhaps observe  ' True ;
</p>
<p>hut all this is only the elucidation of unbarring the
</p>
<p>gates of preferment unsparingly and honestly.'

</p>
<p>Ireland in the former year, by the most sufficient
</p>
<p>criterion of the amount at Ballinasloe fair, we shall
</p>
<p>find that Ireland had then mom for sale than in 1835,
</p>
<p>and consumed the greater part of the surplus over
</p>
<p>her export  exporting the remainder in the more
</p>
<p>valuable form of provisions.
</p>
<p>" The parliamentary documents quoted before,
</p>
<p>enable us to show what the export of provisions was
</p>
<p>in the years 1799 and 1835 : 
</p>
<p>Export of
</p>
<p>Cattle.
</p>
<p>Swine.
</p>
<p>Becf&Porl!,

<p>Barrels.

</p>
<p>1835 98,000 7(5,000 140,000
</p>
<p>" There has then been since the union a decrease
</p>
<p>of the more valuable export, viz., provisions  valua-
</p>
<p>ble because of the labour employed at home in their
</p>
<p>manufacture; and an increase of the less valuable,
</p>
<p>viz., the live animals  less valuable to a country as
</p>
<p>an article of export, by reason of the small quantity
</p>
<p>of employment which is given in the preparing of it.
</p>
<p>'' As the diminution of the number of barrels of
</p>
<p>beef and pork will not by any means account for the
</p>
<p>great increase of the live export  while the whole
</p>
<p>number of cattle produced in Ireland in 1835, was,
</p>
<p>at any rate, notgreater than in 1799  it follows that
</p>
<p>much of the excess of live export in 1835 must have
</p>
<p>been by deduction from the number previously con-
</p>
<p>sumed at home, and therefore that the home con-

</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you must be.nr in mind that the trade
</p>
<p>of cattle exportation is much more beneficial to the
</p>
<p>))opulation of a country than made-up provisions.
</p>
<p>The increase in the cattle exportation trade is indi-
</p>
<p>cative of a country's prosperity in a degree much
</p>
<p>more eminent than the increase in the provision
</p>
<p>trade. In fact an increase in the latter branch of
</p>
<p>commerce is rather indicative of distress amongst
</p>
<p>the people. In the one case we have an evidence of
</p>
<p>prosperity, and in the other a clear proof of poverty
</p>
<p>and destitution. In 1833, Dr. Hoyton gave us the
</p>
<p>advantage of a clear research upon this subject.
</p>
<p>Permit me to read it for you : 
</p>
<p>"The exports and imporis, as far as they are a
</p>
<p>test of a decay of profitable occupation  so far as the
</p>
<p>exports and imports are supplied from the parlia-
</p>
<p>mentary returns  exhibit extraordinary evidences
</p>
<p>of the condition of the labouring classes. The im-
</p>
<p>portation of flaxseed (an evidence of the extent of a
</p>
<p>most important source of employment) was  In
</p>
<p>1790, 339,745 barrels; 1800, 327,621 barrels; 1830,
</p>
<p>469,438 barrels. The importation of silk, raw anci
</p>
<p>thrown, was In 1790, 92,09llbs. ; 1800, 79,0661bs. ;
</p>
<p>J830, 3,19Ulbs. Of nnwrought iron, in 1"9(), 2,271
</p>
<p>tons; in 1800, 10,241 tons; in 1830, 871 tons.

<p>Formerly we spun all our own woollen and worsted

<p>yarn. We imported in 1790, only 2,2941bs. ; in
</p>
<p>18U0, l,8801bs. ; in 1826, 662,7301bs. An enormous
</p>
<p>increase. There were, I understand, upwards of
</p>
<p>thirty persons engaged in the woollen trade in Dub-
</p>
<p>lin, who have become bankrupts since 1831. There
</p>
<p>has been doubtless an incresise in the export of

<p>cottons. The exports were  In 1800, 9,147 yards ;

<p>It is to you, gentlemen, that I appeal for a solution

<p>of this proposition. I have established my position ;

<p>I have shown the prosperity of Ireland before the

<p>to Ireland by a restoration of her domestic parlia-

<p>vour to remedy this state of things ? That we are
</p>
<p>combined for repeal is our pride and boast ; but that
</p>
<p>ive are combined together for any illegal or crimhial
</p>
<p>purpose is an idea which, with scorn and indigna-
</p>
<p>tion, we repudiate. Even before the union was in-
</p>
<p>troduced, the moment there was an apprehension of
</p>
<p>its being introduced, coupled, as it was then said
</p>
<p>to be, with Catholic emancipation, the Catholics of
</p>
<p>Dublin held a meeting in Francis-street, on the 9th
</p>
<p>of April, 1795, John Sweetman in the chaii', atwhich
</p>
<p>they expressed their indignant refusal to accept
</p>
<p>emancipation coupled with any union measure. Tlie
</p>
<p>first time I addressed a public assembly was on the
</p>
<p>13th of January, 1800. It was my maiden speech.
</p>
<p>Pray listen to the last passage of the speecli, and
</p>
<p>you will find that the ruling principles of my entire
</p>
<p>political life are all embodied in it, and that my
</p>
<p>views were anything, and are anything, but secta-
</p>
<p>rian. [Mr. O'Connell then read the passage from
</p>
<p>his speech.] That was my first public declaration.
</p>
<p>In the sincerity of my soul I made that declaration
</p>
<p> in the sincerity of my soul I made that offer. It
</p>
<p>might have been taken up ; there was a strong party
</p>
<p>in the country at that time highly unfavourable to
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholic claims. But I risked it, and I
</p>
<p>repeat, in the sincerity of my soul, I made the
</p>
<p>declaration that I would prefer the re-enactment
</p>
<p>of the penal code in all its horrors than consent
</p>
<p>to the union ; and I threw myself upon the gene-
</p>
<p>rosity of my fellow-countrymen, the Protestants
</p>
<p>of Ireland. Gentlemen, in 1810, you have already
</p>
<p>heard, the repeal was brought forward, and pub-
</p>
<p>lic meetings were held in the city of Dublin. My

<p>speech upon one of those occasions has been read

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.

<p>" It is for a Cousorvative government alone to
</p>
<p>achieve tliis glory. Let Sir Kobert Peel and his
</p>
<p>(Colleagues look to it."
</p>
<p>It appears by those papers that we did not threaten
</p>
<p>anything, and it appears distinctly that every dis-
</p>
<p>claimer, and repetition of disclaimer, to use anything
</p>
<p>but peaceable and legal means, was given over and
</p>
<p>over again. There was no violence of any Icind ;
</p>
<p>none whatever had taken place. Weare now charged
</p>
<p>with a newspaper conspiracy, because it is alleged
</p>
<p>that certain newspapers contained libels. AVhy, if
</p>
<p>they did, there is no person in the world more open
</p>
<p>to or capable of punishment for an offence than a
</p>
<p>newspaper proprietor. He is perhaps more in the
</p>
<p>bands of the law than any other man in existence.
</p>
<p>There is the stamp-office, which must know all
</p>
<p>about him, and the moment he offends tliey have
</p>
<p>nothing to do but call on him to account for his ac-
</p>
<p>tions. The Attorney-General had tliis facility if he
</p>
<p>wished, or if the libel law had been infringed. But
</p>
<p>there is one thing in the so-called newspaper conspi-
</p>
<p>racy that cannot be got over. Take up the Nation
</p>
<p>which was read for you  a great deal of prose and a
</p>
<p>considerable quantity of poetry  love songs and all
</p>
<p>(laughter)  and tlien take up the Pilot, wliich was
</p>
<p>also read for you  all prose and no poetry  take up
</p>
<p>any of these articles, and can you say that one of
</p>
<p>the journals copied the other ? Can they produce
</p>
<p>any of these papers where the other copied an article
</p>
<p>from it .' No, they cannot ; and they could not
</p>
<p>charge them with conspiracy unless they joined for
</p>
<p>tliat purpose. In place of conspiracy they would
</p>
<p>nd discord, not concord, between them. There
</p>
<p>was not a particle of combination amongst them. In

<p>fact, there was not only no combination amongst
</p>
<p>them, but a kind of rivalship and jealousy relative
</p>
<p>to these articles. Was that like combination or
</p>
<p>rime ? I will not go into that question at present
</p>
<p>as it is so well ascertained. Well, gentlemen, one
</p>
<p>word about arbitration courts. I shall not trouble
</p>
<p>you with many observations on that bead. One of
</p>
<p>the great advantages of these courts, however, was
</p>
<p>the abolition of unnecessary and superfluous oatlis.
</p>
<p>There was no oatli taken in these courts at all.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I do not know if it strikes you in the
</p>
<p>same light as it strikes me on the subject of oaths ;
</p>
<p>hut I think the establishing of such courts a great
</p>
<p>advantage in that respect. In the superior courts
</p>
<p>the oath was a different thing ; but I ask any chris-
</p>
<p>tian raau if he would not wish to see unnecessary
</p>
<p>swearing abolislied ? I find by a parliamentary re-
</p>
<p>turn in 1832 that there were one hundred and se-
</p>
<p>Tenty-two thousand oaths taken in the excise de-
</p>
<p>partment, and in another year one hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty-eight thousand in the excise also. This was an
</p>
<p>unnecessary profanation of the name of the Deity. 
</p>
<p>one hundred and fifty-eight thousand oaths in one
</p>
<p>3'ear, and one hundred and seventy-two thousand in
</p>
<p>another! What an enormous quantity of unneces-
</p>
<p>sary oaths ! In the arbitration courts there was no
</p>
<p>oath whatever necessary. I shudder at the idea of
</p>
<p>so many oaths being taken in one year, and I had
</p>
<p>Several conversations on the subject, and Lord Nu-
</p>
<p>gent did me the high honour to ask my assistance in
</p>
<p>bringing in a bill to abolisli unnecessary oaths and
</p>
<p>substitute a declaration in their stead. I consented,
</p>
<p>and we succeeded in passing a bill substituting de-
</p>
<p>clarations instead of oaths, and I hope I shall see

<p>fence ; but it is broUglit before you on the part of I

<p>the crown, and produced by the Attorney-General ;
</p>
<p>that is the Attorney-General's evidence, and upon
</p>
<p>that evidence I call upon you to acquit us  you are
</p>
<p>bound to believe it ; there is the plan for repeal,
</p>
<p>what fault do you find with it ? There is a theory
</p>
<p>introduced into it not called upon for practice, but
</p>
<p>I insist upon my right to discuss that theory. I may
</p>
<p>be wrong, but it is a great constitutional question
</p>
<p>which man is at liberty to discuss, and form his
</p>
<p>opinions upon. Tlie opinion may be erroneous, but
</p>
<p>the right is undoubted, and I insist upon it that
</p>
<p>question ought to be considered in a way favourable
</p>
<p>to the claims of Ireland. The competency of the
</p>
<p>Irish parliament to pass the act of union was dis-
</p>
<p>cussed long before the union itself was talked of.
</p>
<p>One of the works by which the revolution of 1688
</p>
<p>was consolidated was a book written by Mr. Locke
</p>
<p>upon government. He wrote it for the purpose of
</p>
<p>Bustaiuing the Whigs of that day  the Willianiite
</p>
<p>Whigs  to prove that James had no title to tlie
</p>
<p>throne, and that William was the lawful monarch of
</p>
<p>England in consequence of what hadhappeued. That
</p>
<p>book, gentlemen of the jury, was a class book in
</p>
<p>Trinity College at the time the union passed. It
</p>
<p>was a book out of which the young men were exa-
</p>
<p>mined. Shortly after the union it was found incon-
</p>
<p>venient to let it remain, and for some reason I don't
</p>
<p>know the cause, but it was withdrawn. But at one
</p>
<p>time it was a book of authority, and requiring not
</p>
<p>any council to give it authority ; it was the great
</p>
<p>instrument by means of which the revolution of '88

</p>
<p>power of making laws into other hands, for it being
</p>
<p>but a delegated power from the people, they who
</p>
<p>have it cannot pass it over to others. The people
</p>
<p>alone can appoint tlie form of the comnionwealtli,
</p>
<p>which is by constituting the legislature and appoint-
</p>
<p>ing in whose hands that shall he ; and when the
</p>
<p>people will have said, we submit and will be governed
</p>
<p>by laws made by such men and in such terms, nobody
</p>
<p>else can say other nieu shall make laws for them.
</p>
<p>The power of the legislature being derived from the
</p>
<p>people by a positive voluntary grant and institution,
</p>
<p>can be no other than what the positive grant con-
</p>
<p>veyed, which being only to make laws and not to
</p>
<p>make legislatures, the legislature can have no power
</p>
<p>to transfer their authority of making laws, or to
</p>
<p>place it in other hands."
</p>
<p>No doctrine can be more distinct. No delegated le-
</p>
<p>gislature, elected for a time, had power or authority
</p>
<p>to transfer the rights of their constituents to any tody
</p>
<p>else. Upon this subject Lord Grey was very explicit.

<p>British house of commons ' Tliougli you should be

<p>able to carry the measure, yet the people of Ireland

<p>would wait for an opportunity of recovering their

<p>rights, wliich they will say were taken from them

<p>of truth and reason ; I state not merely the opinions
</p>
<p>of the ablest and wisest men who have written on
</p>
<p>the science of government ; but I state the practice
</p>
<p>of our constitution as settled at the era of the revo-
</p>
<p>lution ; and I state the doctrine under which the
</p>
<p>House of Hanover derives its title to the throne.
</p>
<p>Has the king a right to transfer his crown ? Is he
</p>
<p>competent to annex it to the crown of Spain, or any
</p>
<p>other country ? No; but he may abdicate it, aud
</p>
<p>every man who knows the constitution, knows the
</p>
<p>consequence  the right reverts to the next in suc-
</p>
<p>cession. If they all abdicate, it reverts to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple. The man who questions this doctrine, in the
</p>
<p>same breath must arraign the sovereign on the throne
</p>
<p>as a usurper. Are you competent to transfer your
</p>
<p>legislative right to the French council of five hun-

<p>dred ? Are you compentent to transfer them

<p>to the British parliament? I answer  No! If you

<p>reverts to the people from whom it issued. Your-

<p>cannot extinguish. It is enthroned in the hearts of

<p>lay your hands on the constitution  it is above your
</p>
<p>powers." I insist on the truth of that constitutional
</p>
<p>law. I take the qualification as laid down by
</p>
<p>Saurin  it is binding as a law while it continues to
</p>
<p>have the form and shape and pressure of law  but
</p>
<p>it does not bind on conscience or principle  a right
</p>
<p>though it had been said to me, wliy tliis would
</p>
<p>make all the a<:ts which were passed since the union
</p>
<p>void. I deny it  it would do no such thing. I say
</p>
<p>they are voidable, but not void. It has been said,
</p>
<p>you would by that repeal even the emancipation
</p>
<p>act. If I could get the repeal of the union, I
</p>
<p>would make you a present of emancipation. Where
</p>
<p>do I find the principle of its being voidable, not
</p>
<p>void. I find it in the language of Saurin. I may
</p>
<p>bs wrong in this position, but I cannot be wrong
</p>
<p>to argue from it. It ra.xy be said that this act is
</p>
<p>to be obeyed, and it is to be considered as law.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, the point was raised al-
</p>
<p>ready in 1782, when the Irish parliament declared
</p>
<p>that no power on earth could bind the Irish people
</p>
<p>but the king, lords, and commons of Ireland ; and
</p>
<p>there was an act passed to that effect, the conse-
</p>
<p>quence of which was to do away with the authority
</p>
<p>of all laws passed in England, and which were
</p>
<p>binding on Ireland, though they regulated the pro-
</p>
<p>perty of Ireland ; but Chief Baron Yelverton stepped
</p>
<p>in, and by his act declared all laws passed in Eng-
</p>
<p>land to be binding in Ireland, aud that they should
</p>

</p>
<p>in misery and'filth ? Gentlemen, why shoukl we not
</p>
<p>adopt any plan by which we would escape from these

<p>horrors ? To be sure, the poor law commissioners
</p>
<p>go more into details. Mind you, gentlemen, this is
</p>
<p>evidence made on oath before the poor law commis-
</p>
<p>sioners. Allow me to read some of it to you. " One

<p> another subsisted on a quart of meal a-day

<p>another lived on a little boiled cabbages without

</p>
<p>not harass your feelings by reading any more, the

<p>book is full of them ; and are two millions three
</p>
<p>hundred thousand of your fellow-countrymen to live

<p>for them ? Is no effort to be made ? Permit me to
</p>
<p>call your attention to a few passages of a report of

<p>a meeting held last Monday week, in reference to
</p>
<p>the sick and indigent of your city. [Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>then read an extract from Saundus, detailing tlie

<p>misery which pervaded the city.] Can any language

<p>of mine describe the misery which exists more fully ?
</p>
<p>Another hideous feature of Captain Larcom's report
</p>
<p>is, that the population is diminishing by 70,0(JO in
</p>
<p>ten years. It increased from the period of 1821 to

<p>world, no country is in possession of such harbours,
</p>
<p>the earliest historical mention of which is made by
</p>
<p>Tacitus, admitting that our harbours are the best,
</p>
<p>and that consequently they were more crowded.
</p>
<p>The country is intersected with noble estuaries.
</p>
<p>Ships of five hundred tons burden ride into the heart
</p>
<p>of the country, safe from every wind that blows.
</p>
<p>No country possesses such advantages for commerce,
</p>
<p>the machinery of the world might be turned by the
</p>
<p>water-power of Ireland. Take the map, and dissect
</p>
<p>it, and you will find that a good harbour is not more
</p>
<p>remote from any spot in Ireland than thirty miles.
</p>
<p>Why is not the country prosperous? Did I not
</p>
<p>read for you of the unheard-of magical prosperity
</p>
<p>that followed her legislative independence? Did I
</p>
<p>not read extracts from the writings and speeches of
</p>
<p>men most adverse to Ireland  of men most anxious
</p>
<p>to conceal her greatness as evidence of her increasing
</p>
<p>prosperity under her parliament? What happened
</p>
<p>once will surely happen again. Oh, gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>struggle to rescue the poor from poverty, and to
</p>
<p>give wages and employment to those now idle  to
</p>
<p>keep our gentry at home by an absentee tax after
</p>
<p>the example of the government last year, if by no
</p>
<p>other means, and compel them to do their duty to
</p>
<p>their country. I leave the case to you  I deny that
</p>
<p>there is anything in it to stain me with conspiracy 
</p>
<p>I reject with contempt the appellation. I have
</p>
<p>acted in the open day in the presence of the govern-

<p>was secret, private, or concealed  there was notliing

</p>
<p>THE lEISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Are you able to state whether it was an accurate
</p>
<p>report? Two reports appeared in tlie Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal. With regard to the topics, I am quite sure
</p>
<p>they were all correctly given. The second report
</p>
<p>was more correct ; the periods were better rounded.
</p>
<p>"We had not so good a corps of reporters iu Dublin
</p>
<p>as we have now.
</p>
<p>But substantially the topics were the same in both
</p>
<p>reports? Yes ; but the second report was decidedly
</p>
<p>the best. [The witness then read the speech re-
</p>
<p>ferred to.] I am now connected with the Dublin
</p>
<p>Evening Post. In the year 1800, John M'Ghee,
</p>
<p>senior, was the proprietor of that paper. The file
</p>
<p>of the Dublin Evening Post, of the 14th January,
</p>
<p>1800, was then handed to witness, and having pointed
</p>
<p>out in it a speech of Mr. O'Connell's made at a
</p>
<p>meeting of Roman Catholics, it was read to the
</p>
<p>court by Sir Colman O'Loghlen. The speech ad-
</p>
<p>verted to the means by which the act of union was
</p>
<p>procured, the evils it ent.ailed on the country, the
</p>
<p>necessity of struggling for its repeal, even though
</p>
<p>the agitation for emancipation should be abandoned
</p>
<p>for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Sir Colman O'Loghlen read from the Freeman of
</p>
<p>the 10th May, 1810, the address of the freeholders
</p>
<p>of the city of Dublin to Mr. Grattan ; he also read
</p>
<p>the answer of that gentleman. The learned counsel
</p>
<p>read another address from the same body to Sir
</p>
<p>Kobert Shaw, witli that gentleman's answer. He
</p>
<p>also read from the same paper a very numerously-
</p>
<p>signed requisition for the repeal of the union.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General repeated his objection to
</p>
<p>this evidence.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  The objection comes very late ;

<p>other evidence of nearly a like nature was admitted
</p>
<p>without objection.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  We have not sought to ex-
</p>
<p>clude the documents already read, because'they had
</p>
<p>reference to what was said by Mr. O'Connell himself
</p>
<p>at those meetings relating to the repeal of the union ;
</p>
<p>but it appears to me a verj' different question with
</p>
<p>regard to the present objection. It is as much that
</p>
<p>the public time should not be unnecessarily occupied,
</p>
<p>not caring much whether it is proved or not.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  It is very little value one way or
</p>
<p>the other.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  Having been opened in statement
</p>
<p>by Mr. Sheil we thought it right to offer evidence
</p>
<p>to that effect.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  It's quite outside the issue to

</p>
<p>393
</p>
<p>tain resolutions wliich were passed with impunity
</p>
<p>in England and in Scotland, and which it was con-
</p>
<p>tended were similar to the resolutions for which the
</p>
<p>London Convention was prosecuted ; but the court
</p>
<p>were on that occasion unanimous in deciding tliat
</p>
<p>the resolutions could not be admitted in evidence,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Erskine acquiesced in this judgment. The
</p>
<p>cases, he contended, were completely similar in point
</p>
<p>of law, and the principle involved was identical.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice delivered his judgment. He
</p>
<p>said  In my opinion the evidence is clearly admis-
</p>
<p>sible, and the nature of the charge brought against
</p>
<p>the traversers is such as to prove that it ought to be
</p>
<p>received. The indictment is this, or to this effect,
</p>
<p>that the travei'sers conspired together in order to
</p>
<p>bring into disrepute the Queeu's courts of justice
</p>
<p>and the tribunals of justice existing by law in this
</p>
<p>country, and to substitute other modes of deter-
</p>
<p>mining differences between the Queen's subjects in
</p>
<p>derogation of the Queen's courts. Surely it cannot
</p>
<p>be contended but that the animus or intent with
</p>
<p>which these things are done enters into the essence
</p>
<p>of the charge. The traversers are charged with
</p>
<p>having established the arbitration system with the
</p>
<p>criminal intent of depreciating her Majesty's courts
</p>
<p>and bringing tliem into disrepute, and surely they
</p>
<p>ought to be permitted to adduce such evidence as they
</p>
<p>suppose will have the effect of proving that their
</p>
<p>motives and intentions were not of the nature attri-
</p>
<p>buted to them. In a question of intention of tliis
</p>
<p>kind, when the question is guo animo, these things
</p>
<p>were done. It is essential that the court and jury
</p>
<p>should have the fullest and most authentic evidence
</p>
<p>before them, and it is perfectly fair that the tra-

</p>
<p>versers should be permitted to submit to the consi-
</p>
<p>deration of the court this proposition, whether there
</p>
<p>is not a vast number of highly respectable men in
</p>
<p>the community who, witliout any criminality having
</p>
<p>ever been alleged against them, have adopted a plan
</p>
<p>exactly similar as tlie traversers aver to, that for
</p>
<p>the adoption of whicli they (the traversers) are now
</p>
<p>put upon their trial. They no doubt allege that
</p>
<p>their intentions in adopting the arbitration system
</p>
<p>is equally pure as the intention of the Society of
</p>
<p>Friends. They assert that one of the most respect-
</p>
<p>able classes in the community adopted similar prac-
</p>
<p>tices without ever having been objected to ; and
</p>
<p>surely these are matters fit to be inquired into and
</p>
<p>taken into consideration when we find that the tra-
</p>
<p>versers are accused of having establislied the courts
</p>
<p>with a criminal intent. In this view of the subject
</p>
<p>I think the evidence is clearly admissible.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton said he was sorry to be
</p>
<p>obliged to differ from the Lord Chief Justice, and
</p>
<p>he believed from the rest of the court also. A legal
</p>
<p>principle, however, was involved, and he could not
</p>
<p>acquiesce in tlie reasoning by wliich it was endea-
</p>
<p>voured to make such evidence admissible on the
</p>
<p>present occasion. It was very true that a question
</p>
<p>of intention might be involved in the present case,
</p>
<p>and the object of the traversers in bringing the pre-
</p>
<p>sent witness on the table might be to show that the
</p>
<p>intention imputed to them by the indictment was
</p>
<p>erroneously imputed ; but I am rather inclined to
</p>
<p>think that the intentions of a party in doing parti-
</p>
<p>cular acts is to he decided from his own acts and
</p>
<p>his own declarations, and not from the actions and
</p>
<p>declarations of other persons. If the principles
</p>
<p>394
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>gpecting ai'bitration courts did not necessarily in-
</p>
<p>volve the criminal intent. The traversers had, how-
</p>
<p>ever, not merely to prove those rules, but should go
</p>
<p>farther and show cases in which the acts of the arbi-
</p>
<p>trators made by those rules were agreed to and held
</p>
<p>binding. Would not that be powerful evidence to
</p>
<p>go to the jury, to show that this course of proceed-
</p>
<p>ing could not necessarily involve a criminal intent?
</p>
<p>and that was the only point here.
</p>
<p>The witness then read the following rules of the
</p>
<p>Society of Friends respecting arbitration ; 
</p>
<p>" Advised That all frieuds do keep out of dif-
</p>
<p>ferences; that one friend go not to law with ano-
</p>
<p>ther. And it being considered in this meeting that
</p>
<p>it is inconvenient and of bad consequences for friends
</p>
<p>to be forward in going to law, advised  that all
</p>
<p>friends be careful to avoid as much as may be, and
</p>
<p>endeavour to live at peace with all men, for we are
</p>
<p>called to peace, and to be a peaceable people  U.
</p>
<p>1677 1687 1807.
</p>
<p>" Advised That no friends shall go from the order
</p>
<p>of truth, and former advice, to sue one another at
</p>
<p>law, but that all differences among friends be speed-
</p>
<p>ily ended by themselves, or by reference, and not
</p>
<p>prolonged or delayed  L. 169U.
</p>
<p>" Friends are desired to be zealously and heartily
</p>
<p>concerned to put a speedy end to differences that
</p>
<p>may happen between any ft-iends ; and that when
</p>
<p>any disagreement is determined, the persons con-
</p>
<p>cerned do quietly submit tliereio, without showing
</p>
<p>discontent, or using any reflections or unseemly ex-
</p>
<p>pressions either against the arbitrators or person or
</p>
<p>persons with whom the difference had been ; and

<p>the one hand or the other ; and thereby make par-

<p>to promote love and peace.  D. 17^0.

</p>
<p>between themselves or by aibitraiuis, without trou-

<p>truth and grief of many friends, that differences do

<p>arise among some professing truth about outward

<p>in which they belong, that they forthwith speak to,

<p>either or any of them, refuse, theu to let them know

<p>that it is the advice and counsel of friends that they

<p>What number of persons compose the societj'?
</p>
<p>About forty when it is full ; sometimes there are
</p>
<p>not so many, but it is filled up as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>When claims are referred to the society the party
</p>
<p>claiming generally names the arbitrator.
</p>
<p>Tell me the names of the gentlemen who compose
</p>
<p>the society? Thomas Crosthwaite, Arthur Guinness,

</p>
<p>Mr. M'Donogh  Are there certain fees paid by

<p>the parties to the society ? Yes, when parties come
</p>
<p>to have arbitration, they are required to lodge four
</p>
<p>guineas each to pay the expenses of the arbitration,
</p>
<p>and then the case is settled by the arbitrators.

<p>Then tlie deed of submission is signed by the par-

<p>It is to those who chose to refer their differences

<p>to the society that arbitration is granted ; it is open

<p>to any person, and strangers may refer their differ-

<p>to be made a rule of court ; the parties referring to

<p>the arbitrators name their own person.

<p>of Mr. O'Connell's in it.
</p>
<p>Mr. I'itzgibbon  I have no desire, my lords, to
</p>
<p>have each of the speeches read, but I am willing to
</p>
<p>have the portions which 1 referred to in my state-

<p>ment read. However, if the other side wish I have
</p>
<p>no objection to the whole of the speeches being
</p>
<p>read.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  I don't know how this paper
</p>
<p>can be made evidence at all, and therefore I object
</p>
<p>to it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Tlie publicly-expressed opinions
</p>
<p>of O'Connell on the subject is in issue, and 1 do not
</p>
<p>Bee how it can be objected to here. AVe have it here
</p>
<p>in one of the papers which the Attorney-General
</p>
<p>alleged was authorised and circulated by the asso-

<p>ciation.
</p>
<p>Attorney-Gengral  Ko, no.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Yes, yes ; you said so.

<p>the proprietor of a newspaper for matter contained

<p>in one of its numbers. He tendered as evidence in
</p>
<p>his favour other eopies of the same paper, and of-
</p>
<p>fered to prove the publication under the statute, but
</p>
<p>was not allowed. He did not object to the proof of
</p>
<p>the speech of 1810, as it was proved, independent of
</p>
<p>the newspaper, by a person who was present.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster  The case alluded to is Watts

<p>Mr. Wliiteside  Cobbett was allowed to give, in

</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Was it objected to ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  No.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin said the court was waiting for

<p>After which discussion as to the admissibility of

<p>the newspaper, it was ultimately handed to Mr.

</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon then said  Have you the decla-
</p>
<p>ration of Dr. Gray, proprietor of the Weekly Free-
</p>
<p>man 1 I have not.
</p>
<p>It then having been proposed that the witness
</p>
<p>should read from the file of the iVeehUj Freeman pro-
</p>
<p>duced by the defendants a speech delivered by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster said  This is not the stamp-office
</p>
<p>copy that is produced ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  Can any man in the world en-
</p>
<p>tertain a shadow of a doubt that the type is pre-
</p>
<p>cisely the same ; and, in the name of common
</p>
<p>sense, I ask, can there be any objection to Mr. Ver-
</p>
<p>non reading from the copy produced ?
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Commou sense ought to tell
</p>
<p>you, Mr. Fitzgibbon, that the one is evidence and
</p>
<p>the other is not.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General not objecting, the witness
</p>
<p>proceeded to read the speech, in which Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell adverted to the necessity of having the fran-
</p>
<p>chise extended, and equal rights and privileges
</p>
<p>meted out to all parties without distinction. He
</p>
<p>also referred to what he considered the injustice of
</p>
<p>having the majority supporting the churcli of the
</p>
<p>minority, and expressed his opinion that the eccle-
</p>
<p>siastical revenues might be appropriated to the
</p>
<p>education of the people at large. The state of the
</p>
<p>representation was next noticed, and a comparison
</p>
<p>made between this country, England, and Wales,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of showing that Ireland was in-
</p>
<p>adequately represented in the imperial parliament.

<p>land notwithstanding the union, if justice were
</p>
<p>done her by the imperial parliament in matters of
</p>
<p>finance.
</p>
<p>" These propositions are capable of demonstration,
</p>
<p>and I think that any man who reads the following
</p>
<p>reports will inevitably perceive their perfect trutli.
</p>
<p>" I have hitlierto for some years struggled to ob-
</p>
<p>tain justice for Ireland from the united parliament,
</p>
<p>but I have struggled in vain.
</p>
<p>" Fellow-countrymen, wliy should we not insist
</p>
<p>upon the repeal of the union statute ? Cut I need
</p>
<p>not argue that point. Every man must feel that it
</p>
<p>must be good for Ireland to govern herself, and to
</p>
<p>have her own income spent within her own bounds,
</p>
<p>and amongst her own people.
</p>
<p>"The conviction tliat the union must sooner or
</p>
<p>later be repealed, has become all but universal. Ire-
</p>
<p>land cannot much longer consent to be a province.
</p>
<p>" There is in truth but one question, and that is,
</p>
<p>how is the union to be repealed ?
</p>
<p>" I do not hesitate to say, that the question ap-
</p>
<p>pears to me of easy solution. It requires but these
</p>
<p>few things to make the repeal safe, certain, and free
</p>
<p>from difficulties.
</p>
<p>" First  Let the agitation for the repeal be kept
</p>
<p>perfectly free from sectarian dissension, and from

</p>
<p>all taint of being a struggle for sectarian ascendancy
</p>
<p>all sects and persuasions must see that they have
</p>
<p>an equal interest in the repeal  no species of politi-
</p>
<p>cal preference can be allowed to any one over the
</p>
<p>others  tlie benefit of the repeal is calculated for all,
</p>
<p>and all sliould combine to obtain it.
</p>
<p>" Secondly  The agitation for tlie repeal should
</p>
<p>be peaceable and legal  there should be no force, no
</p>
<p>violence, no outrage  there should be no threat, no
</p>
<p>menace. In sliort, there sliould be not only no vio-
</p>
<p>Ifition of the law, but no tendency to such violation.
</p>
<p>The acts of tlie repealers should be marked with
</p>
<p>moderation as well as with firmness. The language
</p>
<p>of the repealers should be pacific and conciliatory.
</p>
<p>In manner as well as in matter, every thing should
</p>
<p>be done to disarm hostility, and to obtain and justify
</p>
<p>confidence.
</p>
<p>" Thirdly  It is the bounden duty of the repeal-
</p>
<p>ers to demonstrate, that no man can suffer in goods
</p>
<p>or in person by the carrying of the repeal. The
</p>
<p>repealers must constantly show forth the obvious
</p>
<p>truth, that no man's property will be injured or di-
</p>
<p>minished by the repeal ; and that on the contrary,
</p>
<p>the property of every man nmst be augmented and
</p>
<p>rendered more secure. In short, the repeal must be
</p>
<p>good for every body and injure no one.
</p>
<p>" Fourthly  The actual mode of carrj'ing the re-
</p>
<p>peal must be to augment the numbers of tlie repeal
</p>
<p>association, until it comprises four-fifths of the inha-
</p>
<p>bitants of Ireland. The combination must be open
</p>
<p>and avowed  there must not be any secret society,
</p>
<p>or secrecy of any kind  there must be no declaration
</p>
<p>or oaths  no sign taken, or pass-word  there must
</p>
<p>in short be no violation of the law. nor anj'thing con-

<p>whatsoever in irliich we can procure an alleviation
</p>
<p>of the oppression and degradation inflicted upon
</p>
<p>Ireland by the union.
</p>
<p>" We have formed a national association for the
</p>
<p>purpose of working out, in the manner we have
</p>
<p>already described, tlie repeal of the union.
</p>
<p>" For this purpose pecuniary funds are necessary,
</p>
<p>and we therefore confidently call upon you for a
</p>
<p>repeal rent.
</p>
<p>" It was the Catholic rent that secured emanci-
</p>
<p>pation  the repeal rent will restore our domestic
</p>
<p>legislature.
</p>
<p>" The repeal rent will be the means of exhibiting
</p>
<p>the numerical strength and the sincerity of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of Ireland for repeal.
</p>
<p>" Every person who subscribes one pound is capa-
</p>
<p>ble of being a member of the national association.
</p>
<p>" Every person who collects from others one
</p>
<p>pound is capable of being a member of the national
</p>
<p>association.
</p>
<p>" Every person (male or female) who subscribes
</p>
<p>a, sum of not less than one shilling annually, will
</p>
<p>have his or her name registered in our books as a
</p>
<p>repealer.
</p>
<p>' And, as we are desirous of affording to all  even
</p>
<p>the most humble  the opportunity of practically
</p>
<p>displaying their patriotism and zeal, by contributing
</p>
<p>to the repeal fund, we would suggest, and most
</p>
<p>earnestly recommend, that regulations be entered
</p>
<p>into in each parish, whereby the monthly collection
</p>
<p>of one penny shall be made from those persons who
</p>
<p>prefer paying in that proportion ; and their names,
</p>
<p>equally iis those who pay the shilling in advance,
</p>
<p>shall be enrolled in the national register of repealers.

</p>
<p>is subscribed, the repeal of the union will not much

<p>longer be deferred.

<p>of two millions of the Irish people, to the sum of

<p>100,000/., and the Irish legislature will very shortly

<p>after be seated in College-green.
</p>

<p>the amount of this subscription will test the zeal of
</p>
<p>the Irish people for the repeal ; and will demon-

<p>strate, in a mode devoid of all violence or turbulence,

<p>" Such was the state of Ireland at the time it was
</p>
<p>determined to carry the union.
</p>
<p>" The usual means were these. First  The spirit
</p>
<p>of revolutionary fury was encouraged 1 The rebel-
</p>
<p>lious disposition was actually fostered, until it was
</p>
<p>made to explode ! And biiter religious dissensions
</p>
<p>were promoted amongst all classes of the people ! !
</p>
<p>" For the truth of these allegations there are
</p>
<p>abundant proofs  they are to be found in the re-
</p>
<p>collections of hundreds and thousands of us who
</p>
<p>remember these things which we sorrowfully wit-
</p>
<p>nessed. They are to be found in all the debates on
</p>
<p>the union  in the accusations and ajipcals of the
</p>
<p>opponents to that measure  in the admissions and
</p>
<p>boastings of its advocates. But the most powerful
</p>
<p>evidence of the entire, is the report of the Irish
</p>
<p>house of lords, printed in the latter end of the year
</p>
<p>1798.
</p>
<p>" By that report it appears that the revolutionary
</p>
<p>spirit and military organization of the United Irish-
</p>
<p>men commenced in Ulster  the focus was in the
</p>
<p>town of Belfast  it spread through the greatest
</p>
<p>number of the Protestants and Presbyterians, espe-
</p>
<p>cially the latter, of that province. The superior
</p>
<p>officers had all their meetings in Ulster  amongst
</p>
<p>others the colonels met monthly, and gave in their
</p>
<p>reports of the strength and state of discipline of
</p>
<p>their various regiments  privacy was observed of
</p>
<p>course as much as possible  but one of the colonels
</p>
<p>was a spy in the pay of the treasury ; and he regu-
</p>
<p>larly, after each meeting of colonels, made a report
</p>
<p>to the government of all their proceedings.
</p>
<p>" The Irish government could therefore at once
</p>
<p>hare seized the entire staff of the rebellion  they

<p>could stay its progress, and crush its hopes, by ar-
</p>
<p>resting at once all its leadersbut they allowed it
</p>
<p>to run on and augment for about eleven months,
</p>
<p>without interruption.
</p>
<p>" All this appears from the report of the house of
</p>
<p>lords, above alluded to.
</p>
<p>" Why did the government allow the organizations
</p>
<p>to go on, and the colonels to continue their meetings
</p>
<p>for ten or eleven months without interruption ?
</p>
<p>The answer is obvious  the government had an ul-
</p>
<p>terior object in view, to attain which they thought
</p>
<p>any sacrifice of blood cheap  that object was  the
</p>
<p>union ! !
</p>
<p>' It is true they speculated too dangerously  the
</p>
<p>experiment will never be made again  they ima-
</p>
<p>gined that between the armed force wlilch they then
</p>
<p>commanded, and the powerful auxiliary of the bi-
</p>
<p>gotry of the northern rebels, they could easily sup-
</p>
<p>press the rebellion, when it became just ripe enough
</p>
<p>to frighten the country into the union.
</p>
<p>" But they almost fatally miscalculated. Wex-
</p>
<p>ford, without any previous organization, was driven
</p>
<p>into rebellion by the ferocity of an unhappy noble-
</p>
<p>man. Lord Kingsborough, and of his regiment of
</p>
<p>militia ; and if any one other county had been
</p>
<p>roused to an exertion similar to that made by the
</p>
<p>men of Wexford, the rebellion would have been a
</p>
<p>revolution, and the intended union would have been
</p>
<p>exchanged for an actual and perpetual separation.
</p>
<p>" Even the unforeseen excess to which the rebel-
</p>
<p>lion extended, was converted by the unionists into
</p>
<p>further means for carrying the union. The alarm
</p>
<p>and dismay became greater  the confusion more

</p>
<p>The EPISCOPAL BENCH was brought into market,
</p>
<p>and ten or twelve bishoprics ivere tracked for union
</p>
<p>VOTES ! ! ' The bench of justice' became a com-
</p>
<p>modity  and one chief justice, and eight puisne
</p>
<p>judges and barons, ascended the bench, as the price
</p>
<p>of VOTES for the union ! ! ! It would extend beyond
</p>
<p>our calculation, to make out a list of the generals,
</p>
<p>and admirals, and colonels, and navy captains, and
</p>
<p>other naval and military promotion, which rewarded
</p>
<p>personal or kindred votes for the union.
</p>
<p>" Tlie revenue departments have long too been
</p>
<p>the notorious merchandize of corruption. It is not
</p>
<p>surprising, therefore, tiiat the Board of Excise and
</p>
<p>Customs, either conjointly or separately, and the
</p>
<p>multifarious other fiscal offices, especially the legal
</p>
<p>offices, were filled to suffocation, as the rewards of
</p>
<p>CNION VOTES.
</p>
<p>" The price of a single vote was familiarly known ;
</p>
<p>it was 8,00U/. in money, or a civil or military ap-
</p>
<p>pointment to the value of 2,000?. per annum. They
</p>
<p>were simpletons who only took one of the three, tlie
</p>
<p>dexterous always managed to get at least two out of
</p>
<p>the three; and it would not be difficult perhaps to
</p>
<p>mention the names of twelve, or even a score of mem-
</p>
<p>bers, who contrived to obtain the entire three  the
</p>
<p>8,000/., the civil appointment, and the military ap-
</p>
<p>pointment.

<p>" Lord Castlereagh actually declared in the house
</p>
<p>of commons that he would carry the union, though
</p>
<p>it might cost more than half a million in mere
</p>
<p>bribes. His words, as reported by Gkattan, were
</p>
<p>.  ' Half a million or more were expended some
</p>
<p>years ago to break an opposition  the same, or a

</p>
<p>greater sum may be necessary now.' Such was the
</p>
<p>open, the unblushing, the impudent effrontery of
</p>
<p>Lord Castlereagh. Grattan added, he (Lord Cas-
</p>
<p>tlereagli) ' had said so in the most extensive sense of
</p>
<p>bribery and corruption. The threat was proceeded
</p>
<p>on, the peerage sold, the caitiffs of corruption were
</p>
<p>every where.  in the lobby, iu the street, on the
</p>
<p>steps, and at the doors of every parliamentary
</p>
<p>leader, offering title to some, offices to others, cor-
</p>
<p>ruption to all.'
</p>
<p>" The present Lord Chief Justice Bushe was
</p>
<p>more vehement in his exposure of the atrocious
</p>
<p>means used to carry the union. He stated 'That
</p>
<p>the basest corruption .and artifice were exerted to
</p>
<p>promote it ; that all the worst passions of the hu-
</p>
<p>man heart were entered into the service and all
</p>
<p>the most depraved ingenuity of the human intellect
</p>
<p>was tortured to devise new contrivances of fraud.'
</p>
<p>" Such were the means by which the union was
</p>
<p>carried. It was not a compact.  it was not a bar-
</p>
<p>gain  it was the government, iu tlie words of Lord
</p>
<p>Plunket, availing itself of the calamity and distress
</p>
<p>of Ireland, in a manner worse than impious and
</p>
<p>licentious France would have done, to her bitterest
</p>
<p>enemy.
</p>
<p>" And yet, with all these resources of intimidation
</p>
<p>and corruption the union was defeated in the first
</p>
<p>session in which it w.as brought forward ; and it was
</p>
<p>proved then to be impossible to bribe a sufficient
</p>
<p>number of the members of the Irish house of com-
</p>
<p>mons to vote awiiy the independence of their

</p>
<p>creation of the union  how the bad spirit in which
</p>
<p>it was proposed and carried, was exhibited by ano-
</p>
<p>ther eminent lawyer. We shall call on the public
</p>
<p>to listen to the opinion of Lord Chief Justice Bushe
</p>
<p>upon that subject  this is his opinion : 
</p>
<p>" ' I see nothing in it (the union) but one ques-
</p>
<p>tion  Will you give up the country ? I forget for
</p>
<p>a moment the unprincipled means by which the
</p>
<p>union has been promoted ; and I look on it simply
</p>
<p>as England reclaiming in a moment of our weakness
</p>
<p>that dominion which we extorted from her in a mo-
</p>
<p>ment of our virtue ; a dominion wliich she uniformly
</p>
<p>abused, which invariably oppressed and impover-
</p>
<p>ished us, and from the abolition of wliich we date
</p>
<p>all our jirosperity.'
</p>
<p>' ' He adds : 
</p>
<p>" ' The union is a measure which goes to degrade
</p>
<p>the country, by saying that it is unworthy to govern
</p>
<p>itself. It is the revival of the odious and absurd
</p>
<p>title of conquest. It is a renewal of the abomina-
</p>
<p>ble distinction between mother country and colony,
</p>
<p>which lost America.
</p>
<p>" ' It is the denial of the rights of nature to a
</p>
<p>great nation from an intolerance of its prosperity.'
</p>
<p>" With this quotation we close our report ; hoping
</p>
<p>that the language of these eminent lawyers wiU sink
</p>
<p>deep into the recollection of the country.
</p>
<p>" The people of Ireland can, within the compass
</p>
<p>of this report, behold the means by wliich the union
</p>
<p>was carried ; they can see the inherent defects in
</p>
<p>that measure ; and if they have the virtue their
</p>
<p>forefathers possessed, they will, by obeying the dic-

<p>WILLIAM MORGAN, EXAMINED BY MR. HATCHELL.
</p>
<p>Is a coachmaker, residing at TuUamore.
</p>
<p>Do you remember the meeting held in Tullamore
</p>
<p>on the 16th July last ? I do.
</p>
<p>Do you know where Mr. Deane's house is situ-
</p>
<p>ated ? I do.
</p>
<p>What is the name of the person residing in the
</p>
<p>house at the opposite side of the street ? His name
</p>
<p>is Hand.
</p>
<p>Do you recollect seeing an arch across the street ?
</p>
<p>I do. I saw it at about ten o'clock on Sunday
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>Did you observe what was written on it ? I did.
</p>
<p>Wliat was it ? " Ireland her parliament, or the
</p>
<p>world in in blaze."
</p>
<p>Did you see the arch taken down ? I did.

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>England. If the people would be employed, the
</p>
<p>goals would be empty  no crimes would be com-
</p>
<p>mitted, for it was poverty that caused the commis-
</p>
<p>sion of crime.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vernon then read from the Freeman of the
</p>
<p>16th of August, 1842, a speech made by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell at the association, in which he stated that one
</p>
<p>of the great motives he had for the repeal, was that
</p>
<p>it would cause the spending of four milhons of ab-
</p>
<p>sentee money in this country, together with two
</p>
<p>millions of surplus, wliich was now spent out of this
</p>
<p>country. He read the entire speech.
</p>
<p>As soon as this documeut was read, the Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal of the 14th September, 1841, was produced,
</p>
<p>and the speech of Mr. O'Connell denouncing the
</p>
<p>Chartists was read from it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon said that their lordsliips might
</p>
<p>recollect that he and several others of the counsel
</p>
<p>for the traversers mentioned their intention to pro-
</p>
<p>duce Mr. Power  that he was subpcenaed for the
</p>
<p>pui'pose  and was also served with a crown sum-
</p>
<p>mons to attend. The statement made on that mat-
</p>
<p>ter was perfectly accurate. Mr. Power was now on
</p>
<p>the road, but being in a bad state of health, it was
</p>
<p>with great difficulty that his physician was induced
</p>
<p>to consent to his proceeding to Dublin otherwise
</p>
<p>than by easy stages. He was expected to-morrow
</p>
<p>by one o'clock. On his evidence they were pre-
</p>
<p>pared to prove certain facts, if the crown would
</p>
<p>allow Mr. Power to be examined as soon as he could
</p>
<p>attend, or otherwise the case might stand over mi til
</p>
<p>two o'clock to-morrow.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Are you done with everything else ?

<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon did not wish to take up the time

<p>of the court reading things which he believed the
</p>
<p>jury were not prepared to consider. He would,
</p>
<p>therefore, state to the court that there was no other
</p>
<p>fact which they thought it necessai-y to prove, nor
</p>
<p>was there anything else to which they intended to
</p>
<p>advert. The crown might either throw out of the
</p>
<p>evidence any observations made by them on that
</p>
<p>letter, or let the case be adjourned until i\Ir. Power
</p>
<p>would arrive to-morrow.
</p>
<p>Mr. HatcheU  We want to prove that Mr. Power
</p>
<p>wrot that letter that it was his name which was
</p>
<p>signed to it.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  Let the service of the summons be
</p>
<p>proved.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon was prepared to do a certain thing,
</p>
<p>but what it was it could not be expected he would
</p>
<p>then state, but he would be able to show that his
</p>
<p>evidence would wholly exculpate the traversers
</p>
<p>from anytliing contained in that lettei-. He would
</p>
<p>then take the opportunity of referring to certain
</p>
<p>newspapers, which might be entered as read.
</p>
<p>, The papers were of tlie following dates  Freeman s
</p>
<p>Journal, 21st December, 1841 ; do., 29th December,

<p>Served the copy of the subpoena on Saturday even-
</p>
<p>ing ; the llev Mr. Power was very unwell at the
</p>
<p>time ; he said he was entirelj' in the hands of his
</p>
<p>physician, and that he would go to town the next
</p>
<p>day if he could obtain permission to do so. Mr.
</p>
<p>.Power wrote to his physician, and to Mr. Burn, a

<p>three met on Saturday, and after some conversation,

</p>
<p>so severely taxed. I ask for your verdict, not by
</p>
<p>appealing to your passions or prejudices, but by
</p>
<p>calling upon you, as honest and intelligent men, to
</p>
<p>exercise your sound judgment ; and if you cannot
</p>
<p>give me that verdict upon the fair exercise of your
</p>
<p>judgments as applicable to the evidence, I do not
</p>
<p>ask it at your hands. But before I have concluded,
</p>
<p>I think I shall present this case to you in such a
</p>
<p>light, as will relieve you from the slightest possible
</p>
<p>difficulty as to the course you ought to pursue ; and
</p>
<p>vindicate, in the eyes of every honest and fair man
</p>
<p>in the country, that verdict -which I confidently an-
</p>
<p>ticipate I shall receive. You have heard no less
</p>
<p>than eight addresses on tlie part of the several tra-
</p>
<p>versers. Manj' of these have been not only diflereut,
</p>
<p>but inconsistent. In one respect, however, there is
</p>
<p>a marvellous coincidence amongst them all, and that
</p>
<p>is, gentlemen, the total absence of any, the slightest,
</p>
<p>comment upon  nay, I may say any the least re-
</p>
<p>ference to, the evidence in the case. Not a single
</p>
<p>observation, from the commencement to the close of
</p>
<p>those able and eloquent speeches, has been addressed
</p>
<p>to the real merits of this question. Before I apply
</p>
<p>myself to the details of the evidence on the part of
</p>
<p>the crown, it will be necessary that I should advert,
</p>
<p>as briefly as I can, to the topics which have been
</p>
<p>thus superinduced. I think you will see, that they
</p>
<p>have not the slightest bearing upon the case, and
</p>
<p>that they must have been resorted to for no other
</p>
<p>reason than from the necessity which lay xipon the
</p>
<p>defendants to evade touching >ipon the question
</p>
<p>which you have been sworn to investigate, namely,
</p>
<p>the existence, or the non-existence, of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>which we charge. My learned friend, Mr. kSheii,

</p>
<p>has not often favoured us lately, by exhibitions in
</p>
<p>our courts of his splendid talents and eloquence.
</p>
<p>His appearances have been, " like angel visits, few
</p>
<p>and far between." This, however, was considered
</p>
<p>an occasion, I suppose, on wliich it was necessary to
</p>
<p>resort to something extraordinary ; and accordingly
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell has, on the part of Mr. John O'Connell,
</p>
<p>addressed you (he must pardon me for saying so)
</p>
<p>not upon the case, but upon various other subjects,
</p>
<p>to some of wliich it will be necessary I should advert.
</p>
<p>He appeared as counsel for Mr. John O'Connell.
</p>
<p>He certainly, gentlemen, delighted us by one of the
</p>
<p>most splendid exhibitions of eloquence I ever heard ;
</p>
<p>I must, however, say of his speecii, " materiam su-
</p>
<p>perabat opus ;" the execution was elaborate, but the
</p>
<p>matter very meagre indeed, lu short, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>he threw the case of the client overboard ; and so
</p>
<p>indeed the client himself appeared to consider, for
</p>
<p>you recollect he disclaimed, in a great measure, the
</p>
<p>defence which his counsel had set up for him. Do
</p>
<p>you recollect his promise  " 1 will show you, gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the jury, that my client is innocent of this
</p>
<p>charge?" Co you recollect that ? Now, I ask you,
</p>
<p>can you point out a single fact relied on by him, or
</p>
<p>a single observation addressed to you upon the case,
</p>
<p>tending to show the innocence of his client ? There
</p>
<p>were topics of general interest, but not bearing at
</p>
<p>all on the particular evidence wliich you have heard.
</p>
<p>The first of these was a sort of attack upon the
</p>
<p>crown, or the prosecutors, for the length of time
</p>
<p>which has been suffered to elapse before the prose-
</p>
<p>cution was instituted against Mr. O'Connell and his
</p>
<p>colleagues. Gentlemen of the jury, that struck me
</p>
<p>as a most singular species of defence ; because, gen-
</p>
<p>404
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>necessarily implies secrecy. Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, in a popular sense conspiracy may imply se-
</p>
<p>crecy, because it very seldom h.appens that persons
</p>
<p>who are engaged in an illegal design, enter into that
</p>
<p>design or agreement publicly ; but a conspiracy
</p>
<p>may, so far as relates to the acts that evidence it,
</p>
<p>be as public as any other offence which is the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of prosecution in our law. My friend, Mr.
</p>
<p>Shell, draws liis definition of conspiracy from our
</p>
<p>great dramatic bard. The passage in Julius Ctesar,
</p>
<p>which my friend has referred to on this occasion,
</p>
<p>may convey a popular notion of conspiracy, but we
</p>
<p>must not take our legal definition from the autho-
</p>
<p>rity of Sh.akspeare, as urged by Mr. Shell, or from
</p>
<p>that of Dr. Johnson, as put forward by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell. 1 must beg, in this place, to dispute the au-
</p>
<p>thority of both those eminent personages, and must
</p>
<p>take the liberty of saying, that, in point of law,
</p>
<p>a conspiracy means neither more nor less than this 
</p>
<p>where two or more persons concur in the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of an illegal object. The test is, not the se-
</p>
<p>crecy, but the object of the combination. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, we say that the traversers have concurred in a
</p>
<p>common and unlawful design. That design, I may
</p>
<p>at present generally characterise as this  the at-
</p>
<p>tempt to procure, by means of intimidation, a re-
</p>
<p>peal of the legislative union, which, according to
</p>
<p>the law of this country, cannot be legitimately re-
</p>
<p>pealed but by an act of parliament, the result of the
</p>
<p>free will of the legislature. What does the indict-
</p>
<p>ment charge ? That the traversers entered into a
</p>
<p>conmion plan, by means of seditious speeches, by
</p>
<p>means of large meetings, by means of publications
</p>
<p>in newspapers, by other means specified in the in-

</p>
<p>dictment, to effect that change which can only legi-
</p>
<p>timately be brought about by the instrumentality of
</p>
<p>parliament. And it is monstrous and absurd to tell
</p>
<p>a jury, " we have done all this above board  our
</p>
<p>proceedings have been public  newspaper reporters
</p>
<p>have been present to take our speeches." To be
</p>
<p>sure they were, because the object was to have all
</p>
<p>this brought before the public  to have it read to
</p>
<p>the people of this country  and that emissaries
</p>
<p>should be despatched to all parts of Ii-eland, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of giving publicity to those proceedings.
</p>
<p>Yet we are told, that because these things were pub-
</p>
<p>lic, there cannot have been a conspiracy, from wliich
</p>
<p>they originated. It is curious to observe the anxiety
</p>
<p>that seemed to exist in the minds of the counsel on
</p>
<p>the opposite side, to dispute the soundness of that
</p>
<p>definition in point of law; You will find that what
</p>
<p>they have been labouring to convince you of is this
</p>
<p>that here they have been only prosecuting a legal
</p>
<p>object ; which legal object, they say, they may fairly
</p>
<p>and lawfully accomplish if they can. An attempt
</p>
<p>to interfere with that is, as they contend, an attempt
</p>
<p>to put a stop to the legal and constitutional rights,
</p>
<p>which they and every other subject of this realm
</p>
<p>are entitled to exercise. It is, therefore, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>of great importance, that j'ou should distinctly un-
</p>
<p>derstand, that no matter what the object is which
</p>
<p>parties have in contemplation, if they seek to bring
</p>
<p>about that object by improper and unlawful means,
</p>
<p>they are guilty of a conspiracy. I shall now, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, call your more particular attention to the
</p>
<p>nature of this charge, which I am not quite sure
</p>
<p>that you yet fully understand. We first allege that
</p>
<p>these traversers and others entertained, in common,
</p>

</p>
<p>tlemen of the jury, if you coxae to the conclusion that
</p>
<p>the traversers at the bar, or any one or more of them,
</p>
<p>combined in a design for the purposes that we have
</p>
<p>alleged in the indictment, or for any one or more
</p>
<p>of-tliem, tliat traverser, or those travei-sers, must
</p>
<p>be convicted, thougli you sliould not be satisfied
</p>
<p>that he or they combined for all the purposes, or
</p>
<p>that all the traversers combined for any one purpose.
</p>
<p>[The learned Solicitor then adverted to the law of
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and contended at considerable length in
</p>
<p>support of the law as laid down by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General. Hethen continued:]  Now, gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>shall proceed to explain to you wliy it was, and ne-
</p>
<p>cessarily was, that this prosecution was delayed until
</p>
<p>the period when it was commenced. I have already
</p>
<p>observed upon the singular nature of this defence
</p>
<p>set up on behalf of the traversers. Do you remem-
</p>
<p>ber how often, over and over and over again, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell told the persons assembled at his meetings
</p>
<p>that he was violating no law, that he would ca>jTy
</p>
<p>them through the convention act, that they might
</p>
<p>sit down in the presence of the Attorney-General ?
</p>
<p>Do you recollect how he hurled his high and haughty
</p>
<p>defiance at the law officers of the crown ? Is that
</p>
<p>challenge consistent with this species of defence 
</p>
<p>namely, " You suffered us to violate the law, you
</p>
<p>suffered us to hold these meetings, and to go on,
</p>
<p>without prosecuting us ?" Is it not the duty of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, when we have accepted his challenge, to
</p>
<p>come forward and show you that he did not violate
</p>
<p>the law ? Does he not owe it to those unfortunate
</p>
<p>people, whom, I must say, he has deluded in this
</p>
<p>respect ? Does he not owe it to his co-traversers,
</p>
<p>and the public, to show that there was really no

</p>
<p>violation of the law, or of the constitution, iu these
</p>
<p>proceedings ? Gentlemen, you have already heard,
</p>
<p>that we do not impute to any one of these meetings
</p>
<p>the character of illegality, because it tended to dis-
</p>
<p>turb the public peace. They might have spared
</p>
<p>themselves the days they have e.^hausted in reading
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's exhortations not to commit a crime;
</p>
<p>they might have spared themselves all the observa-
</p>
<p>tions about no person being alarmed as to his per-
</p>
<p>sonal security ; they might have spared themselves
</p>
<p>all this, because we do not say that any one of these
</p>
<p>meetings, so far as that is concerned, wcmld have
</p>
<p>been open to prosecution. Now let us just apply
</p>
<p>that to the argument, that this case was not prose-
</p>
<p>cuted early (we will say) in tlie last year. Suppose
</p>
<p>we had selected a meeting in the month of March,
</p>
<p>and prosecuted the persons who attended at that
</p>
<p>meeting for being present at an unlawful assembly ;
</p>
<p>what would have been the defence, and the triumph-
</p>
<p>ant defenc'e ? That that meeting terminated peace-
</p>
<p>ably ; that though numerously attended, it did not,
</p>
<p>at tlie time, cause any alarm to the public ; that the
</p>
<p>parties assembled met for. the ostensible purpose of
</p>
<p>exercising the legal right of petitioning the legisla-
</p>
<p>ture for a repeal of the .act of parliament. Such a
</p>
<p>defence it would have been impossible for us to meet.
</p>
<p>We should not have prosecuted in a case of that sort ;
</p>
<p>or if we did, we should have been deservedly and
</p>
<p>properly defeated in that prosecution. But, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, you have perhaps yet to learn, (and I think
</p>
<p>the court will tell you that I am right with respect
</p>
<p>to it,) that it is not merely the present conduct, or
</p>
<p>demeanour of the persons assembled  that it is not
</p>
<p>merely violence, or a breach of the peace, or intimi-
</p>
<p>406
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>use their exertions, if possible, to vindicate the law,
</p>
<p>and to arrest the progress of what cannot he denied
</p>
<p>to be a fearful and mischievous evil. Gentlemen, I
</p>
<p>was surprised amongst the tliousaud other topics
</p>
<p>that have been urged in this case, to liear it con-
</p>
<p>tended by the advocates for free rights and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional principles, that there ought to have been an
</p>
<p>act of parliament introduced to put down this agi-
</p>
<p>tati on.  in short, a coercion act. That was actu-
</p>
<p>ally insisted upon, I think, by Mr. Wiiiteside, and
</p>
<p>two or three more. AVhy was not an act of parlia-
</p>
<p>ment passed, say they, to put this down ? Why,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, what would have been said had an act of
</p>
<p>parliament been introduced ? It would have been
</p>
<p>exclaimed  " Here is an attempt by the legislature
</p>
<p>to crush public discussion : why not icsort to the
</p>
<p>common law of the land ?" What would have been
</p>
<p>the argument urged by the opponents of such a bill ?
</p>
<p>'' You have not tried a jury  you have not resorted
</p>
<p>to the common law." Gentlemen, we were anxious
</p>
<p>not to expose ourselves to that imputation ; we have
</p>
<p>resorted to the common law of the land, we have re-
</p>
<p>sorted to a grand jury, we have prosecuted tliis case
</p>
<p>in the regular, legal, ordinary, constitutional way 
</p>
<p>I hope I may add, with a due degree of temperance,
</p>
<p>in a moderate manner, in a mode not indicative of
</p>
<p>any thing like vindictive feeling. I think, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, we cannot be accused of not haWng given the
</p>
<p>traversers Jiere the fullest latitude in defending
</p>
<p>themselves. So many topics irrelevant to the dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of a case were never urged in the course of
</p>
<p>my experience, or, I believe, that of any gentleman
</p>
<p>at the bar. We raised, however, no technical diffi-
</p>
<p>culties ; we suffered the counsel to state the opinions

<p>of others, to read histories, and to make comments of
</p>
<p>every description. Not any species of defence that
</p>
<p>could possibly have been open to them, not any pub-
</p>
<p>lic meeting, not one ground of defence has been ex-
</p>
<p>cluded. 1 therefore say, that it is most imfair to ac-
</p>
<p>cuse the government here, either on the one hand of
</p>
<p>criminal apathy with respect to the progress of this
</p>
<p>agitation, or on the other hand, when they have
</p>
<p>taken up the case and brought it forward in a court
</p>
<p>of justice, of attempting to overbear public discus-
</p>
<p>sion, or to crush constitutional rights. That they
</p>
<p>have not resorted to the legislature to obtain an act
</p>
<p>of parliament ought, in my opinion, to entitle them
</p>
<p>to credit rather than expose them to censure. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, as I have observed, a meeting may be un-
</p>
<p>lawful, not merely from the circumstances which
</p>
<p>accompany it at the time it takes place, but from its
</p>
<p>tendency and object. In the case, my lords, of Bed-
</p>
<p>ford V. Birley, which has been already adverted to,
</p>
<p>in pages 102 and 103, the court distinguished be-
</p>
<p>tween a riot and an unlawful assembly ; after de-
</p>
<p>fining a riot and a rout, the case goes on to say : 
</p>
<p>" An unlawful assembly is, in any case, where they
</p>
<p>meet together in a manner and under circumstances
</p>
<p>which the law does not allow, but makes it criminal
</p>
<p>in those persons meeting together in such a manner,
</p>
<p>knowingly, and with such purposes as are in point
</p>
<p>of Jaw criminal." Now, in the present case, it was
</p>
<p>impossible that I could tell you, or that the counsel
</p>

</p>
<p>But, gentlempn. my friond. l^[r. Slioil, after iKiviny
</p>
<p>dwelt at considerable length on that subject, then
</p>
<p>thought fit to address himself to another topic,
</p>
<p>which, I think, if he had recollected what took
</p>
<p>place before this court, might, in point of prudence,
</p>
<p>have been spared. Gentlemen, he paid the court
</p>
<p>the compliment of saying that he did not believe
</p>
<p>the judges to be corrupt : at first he said he would
</p>
<p>not throw out such an insinuation, and ultimately
</p>
<p>he went the length of saying, " I believe they arc
</p>
<p>not." Gentlemen of the jury, I shall not presume
</p>
<p>to vindicate the character of the high tribunal
</p>
<p>before which I am now standing ; it would be in me
</p>
<p>most presumptuous. But, gentlemen, Mr. Shell
</p>
<p>followed up that observation by one to which I think
</p>
<p>it is ray duty to apply myself; I mean, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the constitution of the jury which is trying tliis case.
</p>
<p>Tou will recollect his quotations from Mr. Bur-
</p>
<p>rowes' speech on the trial of Dr. Sheridan and Mr.
</p>
<p>Kirwan in 1811  that gentleman's animadversions
</p>
<p>upon what he very properly (so far as the legal use
</p>
<p>of the word goes) designated the array of the jury
</p>
<p>upon that occasion. Mr. Burrowes impugned the
</p>
<p>conduct of the officer who arrayed that jury, for not
</p>
<p>having put upon it some Romau Catholic gentle-
</p>
<p>men. It is not for me, gentlemen, to say whether
</p>
<p>the sheriff in that respect acted correctly or not;
</p>
<p>hut it is a most monstrous perversion of justice, to
</p>
<p>apply an observation of that sort or character to a
</p>
<p>jury not returned by the sheriff, not arrayed by
</p>
<p>him, but selected by ballot out of seven hundred
</p>
<p>and seventeen names. Do they mean to say that
</p>
<p>there was any impropriety in the ballot for the jury
</p>
<p>before the officer ? How could we influence the re-

</p>
<p>sult of that ballot ? How could we procure any
</p>
<p>forty-eight names to be taken out of these seven
</p>
<p>hundred and seventeen ? But, said Mr. Shell,
</p>
<p>when the special jury was struck, when the forty-
</p>
<p>eight names were drawn out, we find that ten or
</p>
<p>eleven Roman Catholic gentlemen were struck off
</p>
<p>ty the Crown Solicitor; that in that way the jury
</p>
<p>was (using a very mild phrase) packed for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of trying this case. Gentlemen of the jur^', I
</p>
<p>own I was a good deal astonished at what I must
</p>
<p>call the temerity of my right honourable friend in
</p>
<p>again calling public attention to that subject. Upon
</p>
<p>the motion which took place in this case prior to the
</p>
<p>trial, that foul insinuation was made  foul I call it,
</p>
<p>because I think that if the Crown Solicitor had been
</p>
<p>actuated by the feeling that was imputed to him, it
</p>
<p>would have been most base and unworthy conduct.
</p>
<p>The foul insmuation, I say, was made, that those
</p>
<p>gentlemen were struck off because they were Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics. The Crown Solicitor was bound to strike
</p>
<p>oflf twelve; forty-eight could not be left  each party
</p>
<p>must strike off twelve: twenty-four is the number
</p>
<p>to be returned  he was bound to strike off twelve.
</p>
<p>He struck out twelve accordingly, and those twelve
</p>
<p>perhaps (I do not know how the fact is, but I will,
</p>
<p>for argument sake, admit it) comprising ten gentle-
</p>
<p>men professing the Roman Catholic faith. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, upon the motion to whicli I have alluded, Mr.
</p>
<p>Keramis, the Crown Solicitor, made an affidavit, in
</p>
<p>which he stated that he had received information
</p>
<p>which, at the time, he believed, and which he still
</p>
<p>believes to be true, that these gentlemen were mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the repeal association. Gentlemen, upon

<p>that occasion the answer was, that the truth was not

<p>not call on you to find a verdict against the traver-
</p>
<p>Bers by reason of your entertaining any religious

<p>opinions at variance with theirs, so on the other

<p>hand I must deprecate the introduction of a topic of

<p>that description for the purpose of intimidating you

</p>
<p>the. purpose of inducing you, by the fear of yielding
</p>
<p>to religious prejudices, not to do that duty which is
</p>
<p>imperatively called for by 3'our oaths, and by the
</p>
<p>eyidence in the case. Gentlemen, I make this ob-
</p>
<p>servation, and I beg your particular attention to it,
</p>
<p>that it is for the conduct of the parties connected
</p>
<p>with these proceedings in the year 1843 that they
</p>
<p>aJe now brought before you. I think you will see
</p>
<p>by and by, that whatever may have been the original
</p>
<p>constitution, whatever may have been the original
</p>
<p>objects, whatever may have been the original
</p>
<p>conduct of the association, which was formed in
</p>
<p>the month of July, 1840, the persons who were pro-
</p>
<p>idoting the designs of that association in 1843, were
</p>
<p>pursuing a course utterly at variance with the law
</p>
<p>and constitution of this country. With respect to
</p>
<p>the meeting in 1810, at which Mr. O'Connell deli-
</p>
<p>vered the speech which was read to you at length,
</p>
<p>at which the high sheriff presided, and very manj'
</p>
<p>respectable citizens attended, I fully and freely
</p>
<p>admit that I see nothing iu that meeting, or in the
</p>
<p>proceedings at it, at all at variance with the law.
</p>
<p>I admit fully further that the sentiments which Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell appears to liave deUvered upon that occa-
</p>
<p>sion, are to a certain extent, and only to a certain
</p>
<p>extent, identical with those which he has latterly
</p>
<p>professed. But we are not trying Mr. O'Connell

<p>here for inconsistency in any political opinions ;
</p>
<p>we are not saying that Mr. O'Connell, and the
</p>
<p>other traversers, have, for the first time, in the
</p>
<p>year 1843, proclaimed themselves friends to the
</p>
<p>severance of the legislative connection. I am wil-
</p>
<p>ling to concede that they have always entertained
</p>
<p>the same sentiments ; that Mr. O'Connell, for in-
</p>
<p>stance, as far back as 1800, entertained them ; but
</p>
<p>we are prosecuting Mr. O'Connell, and the other
</p>
<p>traversers, for endeavouring to carry out those
</p>
<p>principles in 1843 by unlawful means. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the meeting of 1810 was a perfectly legal and con-
</p>
<p>stitutional meeting. There was a requisition of
</p>
<p>most respectable merchants ; the meeting was con-
</p>
<p>vened by the sheriff. Every gentleman was allowed
</p>
<p>to deliver his opinions, and a petition was agreed to.
</p>
<p>So far all right. But, gentlemen, where is the use
</p>
<p>of bringing forward the proceedings of 1810, or 1800,
</p>
<p>or 1794, or 1795, or any antecedent period, to bear
</p>
<p>upon a case to which they have no reference what-
</p>
<p>ever, the facts being altogether different ; tlie facts
</p>
<p>being in one case that there was no more than a
</p>
<p>single meeting called for the purpose of petitioning
</p>
<p>parliament; and being, in the other, a succession of
</p>
<p>multitudinous meetings for the purpose (as I shall
</p>
<p>clearly show) of intimidating the legislature into a
</p>
<p>dissolution of the union. But, gentlemen, there was
</p>
<p>then a reference made by Mr. Sheil to other assem-
</p>
<p>blies, Orange lodges and the Hillsborough meeting,
</p>
<p>and the large demonstrations at tliose meetings. 1
</p>
<p>will not take upon me to say, whether they were
</p>
<p>legal or illegal. A single meeting toolc place, very

</p>
<p>why is it long? Because the overt acts, as they are
</p>
<p>called, necessary to evidence that conspiracy, are nu-
</p>
<p>merous ; but the charge itself is perfectly simple and
</p>
<p>perfectly plahi. I read to you in the commencement
</p>
<p>the distinct charges in tlie indictment, tlie several
</p>
<p>branches of it, and you cannot have the sightest
</p>
<p>difficulty in comprehending the nature of the ac-
</p>
<p>cusation. Tlie other matters in the indictment are
</p>
<p>no more than such as every jury must necessarily
</p>
<p>have to consider, namely, the evidence in support
</p>
<p>of the prosecution. Are we, because the facts ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to guide you to the conclusion with respect
</p>
<p>to the indictment are numerous and complicated, and
</p>
<p>evidenced in various ways, are we to be taunted
</p>
<p>with having resorted to an unfair, oppressive, and
</p>
<p>unjust mode of proceeding, when we fairly put for-
</p>
<p>ward those matters, which are merely evidence?
</p>
<p>At all events we might, in point of law, have
</p>
<p>omitted them from the indictment altogether, be-
</p>
<p>cause they are evidence, and nothing but evidence.
</p>
<p>So that tlie indictment, properly so called, is short
</p>
<p>and perfectly intelligible. Well, gentlemen, Mr.
</p>
<p>Moore then says that the Attorney-General has,
</p>
<p>wliat he calls, lain by. He does not indeed say, as
</p>
<p>1 think was insinuated, if not directly charged, by
</p>
<p>Mr. Shell, that this was done for the purpose of
</p>
<p>seducing the accused into the commission of crime;
</p>
<p>but he says the Attorney-General lay by, and that
</p>
<p>it was the duty of the first officer of the crown not
</p>
<p>to suffer these persons to meet together, and do
</p>
<p>these acts, under the supposition that they were
</p>
<p>not in that respect violating tlie law, or acting con-
</p>
<p>trary to the feelings or wislies of the government.

<p>Bwered this reasoning: but in addition to what I
</p>
<p>have already stated on that suliject, I wish to say
</p>
<p>something in reply to the view which Mr. Moore in
</p>
<p>particular has taken with respect to it. I do not
</p>
<p>like introducing into this case anything appoach-
</p>
<p>ing to personality, but Mr. Moore did certainly use
</p>
<p>very strong language, with reference to my friend
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General, for what, he would insinuate.
</p>
<p>had been conduct on liis part leading tliese persons
</p>
<p>to suppose that they had been guilty of no violation
</p>
<p>of the law. Gentlemen of the jury, Mr. Moore
</p>
<p>should baveconsidered, before he made that insinua-
</p>
<p>tion, what is the real nature of this case. He must
</p>
<p>have known perfectly well  though certainly I do
</p>
<p>not blame him for not having brougiit tlie matter
</p>
<p>prominently before you  he must have known per-
</p>
<p>fectly well, that tlie present charge is not the attend-
</p>
<p>ing an illegal meeting, nor the publication of a libel,
</p>
<p>nor a breach of the peace, but the formation of a
</p>
<p>settled design, testified by the acts of the parties, to
</p>
<p>procure a repeal of tlie act of union by intimida-
</p>
<p>tion, and to use, as means to effectuate tliat object
</p>
<p> first, tlie raising a spirit of discontent against the
</p>
<p>constitution  secondly, the sowing jealousy and
</p>
<p>ill-will between different classes of the subjects 
</p>
<p>thirdly, the attempting to create disaffection in the
</p>
<p>army  fourthly, tlie bringing into disrepute tlie ad-
</p>
<p>ministration of justice  and, fifthly, collecting toge-
</p>
<p>ther these multitudes of people. Mr. Moore ought
</p>
<p>to have known that this was tlie gravamen of the
</p>
<p>charge ; and that sucli a charge could only be
</p>
<p>proved by a succession of acts. He ought nut,
</p>
<p>therefore, to have said, that the delay in bringing

<p>forward tlie prosecution was imputable to such mo-

</p>
<p>the paid agent or officer of an assdciation ? If the
</p>
<p>acts of that association be unla^vful, Mr. Eay malies
</p>
<p>himself responsible, as every other member does,
</p>
<p>for the acts of that body to which he has united
</p>
<p>himself. If he has concurred in those acts, it is no
</p>
<p>justification to say that he acted in what he thought
</p>
<p>his duty towards his employers. Mr. Hatchell tlien
</p>
<p>says, " Why did you not call some person who was
</p>
<p>a member of this association, to prove the existence
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy ? Why did you not call Hol-
</p>
<p>brooke ? Why did you include Mr. Ray ?" What
</p>
<p>would have been said if we had? Would it not
</p>
<p>have been said, that the witness was an informer ?
</p>
<p>That he was the hired spy and agent of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment ? Would not the case have been branded as
</p>
<p>one got up by treachery ? Would it not have been
</p>
<p>said, that this person received money for betraying
</p>
<p>his associates ? Gentlemen, you cannot have failed
</p>
<p>to remark, in the whole course of the evidence we
</p>
<p>have not produced any pei'son open to the imputa-
</p>
<p>tion of being a spy or informer.* All the evidence
</p>
<p>has been given independent of the members of this
</p>
<p>association, without the slightest aid from them, or
</p>
<p>any of their body. f Gentlemen, Mr. Hatchell says,
</p>
<p>" Mr. Ray might have been produced as a witness."
</p>
<p>Suppose he had been produced as a witness, what
</p>
<p>do you think would be his answer to the very first
</p>
<p>question put to him ? He would have appealed to
</p>
<p>the court, and he would have asked their lordships,
</p>
<p>whether he was bound to criminate himself, or an-
</p>
<p>swer any question tending to criminate himself. It
</p>
<p>would, gentlemen, have been an irresistible objec-

<p>tion ; he could not have been compelled to answer

<p>one question. Therefore, the idea of making him

</p>
<p>a witness, contrary to his own wish, is absurd. The
</p>
<p>proceedings of this association are all recorded, and
</p>
<p>there are books kept. Where are the books ?
</p>
<p>Might they not have been produced? If by in-
</p>
<p>cluding Mr. Ray in the indictment, we prevented
</p>
<p>his being a witness, have we, therefore, prevented
</p>
<p>them bringing forward any evidence to show what
</p>
<p>the real objects of this association were  ^what their
</p>
<p>proceedings were ? Have we prevented that ? Have
</p>
<p>they done that ? Gentlemen, did you ever before
</p>
<p>meet with a case where the evidence in answer to a
</p>
<p>charge was of the description you heard yesterdaj' ?
</p>
<p>There was not a single person connected with this
</p>
<p>association placed upon the table ; not a single do-
</p>
<p>cument emanating from it was produced, except
</p>
<p>some of a public nature ; not one of their books ;
</p>
<p>none of their oflBcers ; not a single ray of light
</p>
<p>thrown on this ease on their part.f Wlien I come
</p>
<p>to advert to their evidence, I think you will find,
</p>
<p>that instead of detracting from that of the crown,
</p>
<p>it has gone strongly to confirm it. Well, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, it is then said, that trials of this nature have
</p>
<p>taken place in England. Mr. Hunt and others were
</p>
<p>prosecuted in England for conspiracy, and also for
</p>
<p>attending an unlawful assembly. My answer, in
</p>
<p>point of law, to that has been given already. They
</p>
<p>were indicted for attending a single meeting. True
</p>
<p>it is, that in those cases the English jury convicted
</p>
<p>for attending an unlawful assembly, and not on the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. Why ? Because the parties were clearly
</p>
<p>guilty of an unlawful act by attending the unlawful
</p>
<p>assembly. There was no occasion to consider whe-
</p>
<p>ther there was a conspiracy or not ; therefore, the
</p>
<p>jury very properly did convict for attending unlaw-

<p>try, was labouring in tliis common cause, tliougli
</p>
<p>one of them might not linow what the other was
</p>
<p>doing at a particular time, nevertheless, the act of
</p>
<p>one is the act of all, because it is an act in further-
</p>
<p>ance of the common design which they all entertain.
</p>
<p>And thus there is an end at once to this charge of
</p>
<p>injustice, which has been so often reiterated, that
</p>
<p>we are seeking to visit one man with the guilty act
</p>
<p>of another. Gentlemen, we are not seeking to visit
</p>
<p>one man -with tlie guilt of another. We are seeking
</p>
<p>to visit one man with the act of anotlier, but not
</p>
<p>with the guilt of another.* We are seeldng to charge
</p>
<p>each man with his own guUt. What is tliat guilt ?
</p>
<p>Not that he did a particular act, or that another did
</p>
<p>a particular act, but that he embarked in an unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful design with other persons, and that each, in his
</p>
<p>particular way, furthered that end and that object.
</p>
<p>That is the guilt ; and thus each man is answerable,
</p>
<p>not for the guilt of another person, but for his own.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon then says, " a repeal of tiie union
</p>
<p>is the common design, he admits, of these parties."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, he says it is not illegal to combine for
</p>
<p>the common object of obtaining the repeal of the
</p>
<p>union. Certainly not ; hut it is illegal to combine
</p>
<p>to obtain a repeal of the union, by sowing dissension
</p>
<p>amongst different classes of the subjects, by intimi-
</p>
<p>dating the legislature, by causing disaffection in the
</p>
<p>army, and the various other charges in this indict-
</p>
<p>ment. Then he says that we have no right to con-
</p>
<p>vict his client for the public good. God forbid that
</p>
<p>we should seek to convict any man for the public

<p>him ; but if you believe that he is, do not be de-
</p>
<p>terred from your duty by the statement, that we
</p>
<p>are seeking to convict Dr. Gray for the public good.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Mr. Pitzgibbon then says, that his client.
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray, has merely interfered in these proceedings
</p>
<p>as a reporter ; that he has been merely exercising
</p>
<p>his vocation as editor of a paper ; that he has not
</p>
<p>lent himself to this combination, if it be one, and
</p>
<p>that we might as well prosecute any other editor of
</p>
<p>a newspaper for reporting the proceedings of public
</p>
<p>bodies. Gentlemen of the jury, I shall not dwell
</p>
<p>longer upon that, than to say that I mean to call
</p>
<p>your attention, not merely to the publications by
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray of the proceedings of this body, but to his
</p>
<p>acts in furtherance of this common design; acts
</p>
<p>which are not denied, and whicli could not possibly
</p>
<p>be ascribed to any other cause than the existence of
</p>
<p>the design charged in tliis indictment, and Dr. Gray's
</p>
<p>participation in that design. Gentlemen, Mr. Kitz-
</p>
<p>gibbon then says  " It is very true that some warm
</p>
<p>language might have been used at these meetings ;
</p>
<p>you cannot expect persons, in times of poUtical ex-
</p>
<p>citement, and on great public subjects, to preserve
</p>
<p>that strict decorum in language and expression
</p>
<p>which the dignity of a court of justice would ne-

<p>cessarily insure." All this, gentlemen, is very
</p>
<p>plausible, and all very well ; but I thmk you will
</p>
<p>see, that the expressions used in this instance are
</p>
<p>not the effusions of a person, in the heat of the mo-

<p>enrol them in this association. This could only be
</p>
<p>done by personal contact, if I may say so, witli
</p>
<p>each individual through the agents and emissaries
</p>
<p>of the association. It would never do to have a
</p>
<p>number of multitudinous riotous meetings for that
</p>
<p>purpose. It would never do to have tlie public
</p>
<p>peace broken, and constables interfering, the police

<p>interfering, or the army interfering. No, it was
</p>
<p>necessary that this scheme should have time to
</p>
<p>work that each individual should be personally ap-
</p>
<p>plied to that the repeal wardens, and otlier persons
</p>
<p>carrying out the objects of this association, should
</p>
<p>have an opportunity of enlisting those individuals,
</p>
<p>one by one, quietly and successively, witliout making
</p>
<p>any public demonstration, and when the time arrived,
</p>
<p>either for calling one meeting, or another meeting,
</p>
<p>getting their instructions circulated so as to cause
</p>
<p>them to assemble at that meeting ; or, if tlie neces-
</p>
<p>sity should arrive, conveningthem all together for any
</p>
<p>purpose, legal or otherwise, which might be in con-
</p>
<p>templation . Gentlemen, Mr. Fitzgibbon then goes on
</p>
<p>to say, that Mr. O'Connell has always advised his as-
</p>
<p>sociates not toenterinto anycorrespondencewithany
</p>
<p>individualin the army. No doubt Mr. O'Connell gave
</p>
<p>that advice, and very wisely, because to have done so
</p>
<p>would have been to have fallen into the very error
</p>
<p>against which he was anxious to guard them  the im-
</p>
<p>mediate violation of the law. By the statute of the
</p>
<p>37th George III., chap. 40, which was temporary at
</p>
<p>first, but made perpetual by the 57th George III.,
</p>
<p>chap. 7, it is made a transportable offence to tamper
</p>
<p>with any individual in the army ; and of course, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, to enter into any correspondence with any
</p>
<p>member of the array would have been a dangerous

</p>
<p>proceeding. But, gentlemen, is the forbearing so
</p>
<p>to do any answer to the charge, that this language
</p>
<p>was used for the purpose of its having its effect ou
</p>
<p>the army as a body ? Gentlemeu, now I need not
</p>
<p>trouble you further with any of the topics which Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon addressed to you ; they were very nu-
</p>
<p>merous ; I do not mean to say I have adverted to
</p>
<p>them all, but I think I have to the principal of them,
</p>
<p>or at all events to such as had not been used by
</p>
<p>gentlemen who preceded him. Gentlemen, Mr.
</p>
<p>Whiteside then addressed you ; and certainlj' there
</p>
<p>never was a more splendid exhibition of eloquence,
</p>
<p>than my learned friend displayed on this trial. It
</p>
<p>did honour to him, to our profession, and I niaj' add
</p>
<p>to our country. I listened to him with great delight
</p>
<p>and admiration. His speech was also characterised
</p>
<p>by a tone of perfectly good feeling. He did, or at-
</p>
<p>attempted to do, what really and truly is the only
</p>
<p>thing that could, with any prospect of success, be
</p>
<p>attempted in a case of this description. He endea-
</p>
<p>voured to divert your attention, excusably enougli,
</p>
<p>from the merits of the case, and to raise a laugh
</p>
<p>occasionally at some points of the evidence. But,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, he also professed at least to argue tlie
</p>
<p>case upon some points applicable to its merits ; and
</p>
<p>to those I must endeavour to apply myself. Amongst
</p>
<p>others, he stated that Mr. Duffy (for whom he ap-
</p>
<p>peared as counsel) was no more than the editor of
</p>
<p>the Nation newspaper, that his conduct amounted
</p>
<p>to nothing more than the free and legitimate exer-
</p>
<p>cise of his profession ; that the articles he inserted
</p>
<p>in his paper had not been prosecuted ; that he had
</p>
<p>a fair right to assume they were unobjectionable ;
</p>
<p>that if you can attribute a fair and honest motive

</p>
<p>He alludec! to the Party Processions' Act, tfie 2iid
</p>
<p>and 3rd of William the Fourtli, chapter 118; and
</p>
<p>my learned friend made the strange assertion, that
</p>
<p>that act was levelled against a particular party.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there is nothing at all on the face of the
</p>
<p>act to warrant that allegation. The act is quite
</p>
<p>general. It is as applicable to one description of
</p>
<p>persons as to another. No matter what profession
</p>
<p>he may belong to, what politics he may profess,
</p>
<p>any body who violates the provisions of that act is
</p>
<p>punishable under it.* Gentlemen, Mr. Whiteside
</p>
<p>next adverted to a topic which Mr. Shell introduced
</p>
<p>into his speech. I mean the desirableness of hold-
</p>
<p>ing a parliament in Ireland at stated periods. Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell did not sanction that project, and
</p>
<p>therefore I did not advert to it, when applying my-
</p>
<p>self to Mr. Shell's speech. Mr. Whiteside, however,
</p>
<p>j-everted to it, and alluded to a transaction whicli
</p>
<p>occurred in the course of the trial of Hardy on the
</p>
<p>examination of the Duke of Richmond. Amongst
</p>
<p>other grounds on which Hardy defended himself,
</p>
<p>was a letter of the Duke of IJichmoud on the ques-
</p>
<p>tion which tlien agitated tlie mind of England,
</p>
<p>namely, the constitutional reform of parliament.
</p>
<p>The Duke of Kichmond was examined as a witness,
</p>
<p>and he proved that letter. In the course of it this
</p>
<p>passage occurs, on which Mr. Whiteside relied.
</p>
<p>"Before I conclude, I beg leave to express a wish
</p>
<p>that the mutually essential connection between
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Ireland may soon be settled on
</p>
<p>some liberal and fair footing. That which did sub-
</p>
<p>sist was on such narrow and absurd principles, that
</p>
<p>no friend of either kingdom eau regret its loss ;
</p>
<p>founded on constraint and dependence, incompa-

<p>tible with the condition of freemen, Ireland had an
</p>
<p>indisputable right to dissolve it whenever she chose
</p>
<p>so to do. But surely if we do not mean a total se-
</p>
<p>paration, it would be right to agree upon some new
</p>
<p>terms by which wo were to continue connected. I
</p>
<p>have always thought it for the interest of the two
</p>
<p>islands to be incorporated, and form one and the
</p>
<p>same kingdom, with the same legislature, meeting
</p>
<p>sometimes in Ireland as well as in England. But if
</p>
<p>there are difficulties to such an union not to be got
</p>
<p>over at present, some sort of federal union, at least,
</p>
<p>between the two kingdoms, seems necessary to as-
</p>
<p>certain the many circumstances that concern tlieir
</p>
<p>joint interests ; an union of this sort may now be
</p>
<p>formed with much greater propriety than before, as
</p>
<p>it will be sanctioned by the free consent of indepen-
</p>
<p>dent nations." So much was read by my friend.
</p>
<p>The letter then proceeds  "I do conceive that some
</p>
<p>step of this sort is absolutely necessary, because the
</p>
<p>present footing of separation rather than union is
</p>
<p>too unfair to be able long to subsist." This, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, was in 1794. " England, besides the load
</p>
<p>of the whole debt contracted for the use of both
</p>
<p>kingdoms, bears all the burdens of naval defence and
</p>
<p>foreign negotiations, and by far more than its pro-
</p>
<p>portion of the land service in time of war. But
</p>
<p>what is worse is, that there is no certauity now left,
</p>
<p>that we shall have the same enemies and the same
</p>
<p>friends ; different interests, as they may appear,
</p>
<p>may lead one kingdom to think a war necessary,
</p>
<p>and the other to remain in peace ; the same king,
</p>
<p>in his different kingdoms, may think it wise to fol-
</p>
<p>low the advice of his respective parliaments ; I
</p>
<p>need scarcely add that the unavoidable consequences

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ueuu says it was. I do adaiit that they had the
</p>
<p>common object which he says they had  to procure
</p>
<p>a repeal of the union ; I admit that, but I further
</p>
<p>say, that having that object, that ultimate end in
</p>
<p>view, they had the further object, the further com-
</p>
<p>mon purpose, of attaining and arriving at that end
</p>
<p>by the use of unconstitutional and illegal means,
</p>
<p>and it would be a very strange thing to say, that
</p>
<p>because it may be truly alleged, that these par-
</p>
<p>ties were endeavouring to bring about what, in
</p>
<p>the abstract, would be a legal act, but chose to fur-
</p>
<p>ther that by such means as are charged in this in-
</p>
<p>dictment, they are therefore embarked in a lawful
</p>
<p>common purpose, so as to exclude the act of one
</p>
<p>from bearing upon the guilt of the others. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, what is the whole of this indictment ? What
</p>
<p>are we trying? We are trying this : tlie traversers
</p>
<p>are charged, not with a conspiracy to obtain a re-
</p>
<p>peal of the union, but to procure that repeal by the
</p>
<p>means stated in the indictment. If they have not
</p>
<p>adopted these illegal means, the prosecution must
</p>
<p>be given up ; but if they have  if you are of opinion
</p>
<p>that the charges in this indictment are supported in
</p>
<p>point of fact, what answer is it to me to say that
</p>
<p>they intended by these means to effect an end,
</p>
<p>which, if properly pursued, would be lawful? What
</p>
<p>answer is it to me to say, that their object was to
</p>
<p>obtain the repeal of the union? JMr. Henn would
</p>
<p>have been the first himself to detect tlie fallacy of
</p>
<p>such reasoning if used by another. But he did hope,
</p>
<p>I suppose, that it would succeed in diverting your
</p>
<p>attention from the real question. It is m_v business,
</p>
<p>if I can, to undo any effect which that attempt may
</p>
<p>have produced on your minds. I hope you under-

<p>stand that we are not prosecuting these parties for
</p>
<p>the expression of any particular opinion, that we are
</p>
<p>not prosecuting them for combining for a particular
</p>
<p>legal purpose ; no, we are prosecuting them for
</p>
<p>retorting to means which the law and the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion do not sanction, for the purpose of obtaining an
</p>
<p>end which is not illegal, but which pursued in that
</p>
<p>way becomes illegal, and subjects to punishment
</p>
<p>those engaged in it. Gentlemen, Mr. Henn then
</p>
<p>stated that this was a very vague, general charge.
</p>
<p>Whether he meant to s.ay it was such an one as was
</p>
<p>bad in point of law, whether he meant to contend
</p>
<p>that, I do not know ; but with respect to that, I
</p>
<p>will just call the attention of the court to the fact,
</p>
<p>that in the\ charge of exciting discontent and dis-
</p>
<p>affection, which was the part of the iudiotment to
</p>
<p>which Mr. Henn's observations applied, the prece-
</p>
<p>dent in England of the case of the Queen v. Vincent
</p>
<p>was followed, and also that of the King v. Hunt, in
</p>
<p>3rd Barnwell and Alderson, and the eighth plea of
</p>
<p>justification in the case of Redford t>. Birley.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  Is there any case in which a
</p>
<p>single count is so framed ?
</p>
<p>. The Solicitor-General  Yes, my lord, in Hunt's
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>. Mr. Justice Perrin^A single count ?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  Yes, my lord, in Hunt's
</p>
<p>case. It will be just enough for me to refer your
</p>
<p>lordship to the case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin  I am aware it is thrown in,
</p>
<p>in the counts generally, but I want to find whether
</p>
<p>it is singly.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  Your lordship will find
</p>
<p>by reference to the case that it is so. I shall now
</p>

<p>415
</p>
<p>matter which has been heaped upon it, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of obscuring it from your view. Gentlemen, it
</p>
<p>will be necessary for you again to revive your recol-
</p>
<p>lection of this indictment. I have, to a certain ex-
</p>
<p>tent touched already on the subject to which I am
</p>
<p>now about now to call your more especial attention,
</p>
<p>namely, the alleged necessity of your being satisfied
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy having comprised all these objects.
</p>
<p>Upon this point, as upon every other question of
</p>
<p>law, you will, of course, gentlemen, receive and
</p>
<p>follow the direction of the court. It is the nature
</p>
<p>of every criminal charge, that though you may
</p>
<p>lay the offence more extensively than the evi-
</p>
<p>dence is afterwards found to support, yet if
</p>
<p>enough be proved to show the existence of what
</p>
<p>is in law a criminal offeuce, it is the duty of
</p>
<p>a jury to convict for so much. I shall just re-
</p>
<p>fer your lordships to three authorities upon the
</p>
<p>general principle. The case of the King v.
</p>
<p>Hollingbury, 4th Barnwell and Cresswell, page
</p>
<p>329. It was said by the court  " In criminal cases
</p>
<p>It is sufficient for the prosecutor to prove so much
</p>
<p>of the charge as constitutes an offence punishable
</p>
<p>by law." Tills was an indictment for conspiring
</p>
<p>falsely to indict a person for the purpose of extort-
</p>
<p>ing money. The jury found the defendants guilty
</p>
<p>of conspiring to prefer an mdictment for the purpose
</p>
<p>of extortmg money: and that is a misdemeanour,
</p>
<p>whether the charge be true or false. Now that
</p>
<p>clearly shows, that even upon a single count laying
</p>
<p>a single conspiracy, though that conspiracy be not
</p>
<p>proved exactly in the form and manner in which it
</p>
<p>is charged in the indictment, nevertheless if suffi-
</p>
<p>cient be proved to constitute what would, if spread

</p>
<p>upon the face of the indictment, by itself amount to
</p>
<p>a criminal offence, the indictment is proved. Again,
</p>
<p>in the King v. Hunt, 2d Campbell, page 58-3, an in-
</p>
<p>dictment for composing, printing, and jiublishing a
</p>
<p>libel, the only proof given was of publication. It
</p>
<p>was contended that the defendant must be acquitted ;
</p>
<p>but Lord Ellenborough said  " The distinction runs
</p>
<p>through the whole criminal law, and it is universally
</p>
<p>enough to prove so much of the indictment as shows
</p>
<p>that the defendant has committed a substantive
</p>
<p>crime therein specified." The same principle is re-
</p>
<p>cognised in Rex !'. Dawson, 2 Starkie 64. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I just cite those authorities, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of informing 3'ou, that what you have to try is
</p>
<p>this ; are the objects of this conspiracy proved ? Is
</p>
<p>any one of them proved ? Are more than one proved?
</p>
<p>If they are, itwill be yourduty to convict, though you
</p>
<p>should not be satisfied that all are proved. I intend
</p>
<p>to submit, that I have not the slightest doubt I shall
</p>
<p>be able to establish, that every one of the objects of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy alleged in this case is as clearly
</p>
<p>proved, in point of evidence, as anything that ever
</p>
<p>came before a court and jury. But I am anxious to
</p>
<p>guard against any mistake, as to the duty of a jury
</p>
<p>in deciding upon an indictment, as if the question
</p>
<p>they were to try in their box was, not whether any
</p>
<p>of the objects were proved, but whether aU were
</p>
<p>established. Again, as I have already observed, as
</p>
<p>to the several defendants  if six should be guiltj',
</p>
<p>they may be convicted, and two acquitted; so if
</p>
<p>three should be guilty, and so on ; or if one be not
</p>
<p>satisfactorily connected with the conspiracy, then he
</p>
<p>may be acquitted. Having thus, gentlemen, as far
</p>
<p>as I could, cleared the way in point of law, and in

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>tlemen, is one of the cards or bonds of union, belong-
</p>
<p>ing to a certain order of this association. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>as connected with that document, allow me to recal
</p>
<p>to your memory (for I am sure you must have for-
</p>
<p>gotten it), a document which was proved on the
</p>
<p>part of the crown, and as to which, in common with
</p>
<p>every other material piece of evidence in the case,
</p>
<p>one and all of the traversers' counsel have been
</p>
<p>wholly silent. I allude to the document headed
</p>
<p>" Letter to the Secretary of the Loyal National
</p>
<p>Eepeal Association, explanatory of the new card for
</p>
<p>members." I do not care, gentlemen, if the tra-
</p>
<p>versers and their counsel were to spend four more
</p>
<p>weeks in calling your attention to the transactions
</p>
<p>of this association in 1841 and 1842; 1 take them
</p>
<p>up here ; I call upon them to meet the charge origi-
</p>
<p>nating here. That is what they have not done 
</p>
<p>that is what they cannot do. By " the author of
</p>
<p>the ' Green Book.' " Wlio " the author of the
</p>
<p>' Green Book' " is, you will hear presently, in re-
</p>
<p>gular chronological order. ' ' Printed fur circulation
</p>
<p>by order of the committee of the association, April
</p>
<p>11, 1843;" this is proved by JVIr. Browne. The
</p>
<p>document concludes thus :  " This letter, the read-
</p>
<p>ing of which elicited the repeated acclamations of
</p>
<p>the meeting, was enrolled upon the minutes of the
</p>

</p>
<p>of a newspaper, who was simply following his legi-
</p>
<p>timate vocation in publishing, for the informatiou
</p>
<p>of the public, interesting articles of intelligence.

<p>Now, observe, this explanation of the card is en-
</p>
<p>tered upon tlie minutes of the association, and
</p>
<p>ordered to be generally circulated. This card would

</p>
<p>not be issued to any person who did not procure i;lO;
</p>
<p>but one of the objects to be promoted by the devices
</p>
<p>upon that card was, to excite in the minds of the
</p>
<p>people of this country a confidence in their own
</p>
<p>strength, and also a feeling of ill-will against " the
</p>
<p>stranger" and " the Saxon," as our English fellow-
</p>
<p>subjects ai'e termed in the course of these proceed-
</p>
<p>ings. Now, gentlemen, the next document is what
</p>
<p>is called the volunteers' card. I'his machinery ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have been constructed with a view to the
</p>
<p>proceedings of the volunteers of 1782; and I think
</p>
<p>you will find that the real design was, that under
</p>
<p>pretext of founding the steps that were to be adopted
</p>
<p>in the prosecution of this design upon something
</p>
<p>like precedent and legal authority, the form of an
</p>
<p>association somewhat similar to that of 1782 was
</p>
<p>adopted; and, accordingly, the card which a con-
</p>
<p>tributor of 20 (I believe it is) is entitled to have,
</p>
<p>is called the volunteers' card. It is embellished
</p>
<p>with a likeness of Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Grattan, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Flood ; and then, gentlemen, there are like-
</p>
<p>nesses of two persons, with regard to whom Mr.
</p>
<p>Whiteside was so exceedingly facetious ; no one
</p>
<p>was more amused than I was at his comments
</p>
<p>upon them, which showed a great deal of comic
</p>
<p>talent. The subject taken by itself, I must say,
</p>
<p>afforded ample opportunity for the display of his
</p>
<p>powers. But, gentlemen, although he called your
</p>
<p>attention very particularly, and at great length,
</p>
<p>to OUam Fodlah and King Dathy, he overlooked
</p>
<p>Soarsfield, Owen Rowe O'Neill, and Brian Boroihme.
</p>
<p>Now, it so happens, that these are the vei'y persons
</p>
<p>to whom I should wish your attention to be particu-
</p>
<p>larly called. I do not care a farthing what becomes

<p>I suppose, gentlemen, I need not tell you who Gene-

<p>ral Cioney is. " Mr. Barrett next said that he had

<p>to hand in six pounds ten shillings, from a lopality

<p>which was distinguished in Irish story ; he alluded

</p>
<p>lias been, I may say, altogether passed over by the

<p>from the legislature, by peaceable and constitutional
</p>
<p>means, the repeal of the act of union. In April,

<p>1843, appears this paragraph  " Something is com-

<p>ing." Parliament was then sitting, the session not
</p>
<p>far advanced. Parliament sat for a long time after
</p>
<p>this. Now what is the " Something" that " is com-
</p>
<p>ing ?" Is it the discussion of the repeal of the union
</p>
<p>in the house of commons? Is it the presentation of
</p>
<p>petitions for a repeal of the union ? I think you
</p>
<p>will not say so when I call your attention to the
</p>
<p>topics introduced into this production, and the in-
</p>
<p>ferences which the writer calls upon the people, to
</p>
<p>whom it is addressed, to draw from it. [The

<p>the article passage by passage, and proceeded] 
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, observe that up to this time no declara-
</p>
<p>tion had been made in the house of commons by Sir
</p>
<p>Robert Peel, upon the question of the repeal of the
</p>
<p>union. There is no pretence, therefore, for saying
</p>
<p>that anything in this publication can have been ac-
</p>
<p>counted for, or justified, by any expression of opi-
</p>
<p>nion in England ; I mean any authoritative expres-
</p>
<p>sion. I do not quarrel with the use of figurative
</p>
<p>language, strong language, in a document, or in a
</p>
<p>speech ; and I beg leave to deny the imputation that
</p>
<p>we are prosecuting here for warm expressions or
</p>
<p>figurative language. It is for expressions about
</p>
<p>which there can be no mistake that we are prosecu-
</p>
<p>ting. For what was that sent forth to the multi-
</p>
<p>tudes of the Irish people? for what other object
</p>
<p>than this  to show them that England could not
</p>
<p>successfully resist an outbreak, that she was de-
</p>
<p>nuded of troops by the requisitions of her colonies
</p>
<p>abroad, that the utmost she could do was to main-
</p>
<p>tain her empire in the East, that she could not spare
</p>
<p>troops for Ireland, and that if an outbreak were to
</p>
<p>take place it must be successful, as England was
</p>
<p>too weak and crippled to cope with it ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>how often have you been told that there was no-
</p>
<p>thing sectarian in these proceedings or speeclies,
</p>
<p>that the objects were charitable, that diflerences of
</p>
<p>religious creeds were not to interpose any diificulty,
</p>
<p>but that the design was to associate every religious
</p>
<p>persuasion in one common bond of union, for the
</p>
<p>benefit of tlie country ! But, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>with what are the traversers charged ? Not with
</p>
<p>fomenting ill-will between Protestant and Catholic ;

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>holding wp that nation as cold, selfish, and bloody,
</p>
<p>and steeped in blood In every age and every clim-'.
</p>
<p>" Our enemy may be aroused and so must Ireland.
</p>
<p>The county of Tipperary is on its peaceful parade."
</p>
<p>That, I think, gentlemen, carries its own commen-
</p>
<p>tary. Such is the definition of peace by Mr. Charles
</p>
<p>GaVan DufTy. The proceedings in the county of
</p>
<p>Tipperary are " a peaceful parade."
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  U does not say that.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General" The county of Tippe-
</p>
<p>rary is on its peaceful parade."
</p>
<p>Mr- Whiteside  I say it refers to public meetings.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  It says :  " The county of
</p>
<p>Tipperary is on its peaceful parade ; there prevailed
</p>
<p>among the people there a sense of indifference  a'
</p>
<p>disinclination to work until the great task was set
</p>
<p>before them." And then it concludes :^" Twenty
</p>
<p>tliousand Tipperary men, who would as soon, if
</p>
<p>called on, pay their blood as their subscriptions,
</p>
<p>would not form a bad national guard for Ireland."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, the damning effect of tliat
</p>
<p>document was felt by Ms. Whiteside, upon whose
</p>
<p>client it particularly bore ; and what was the course
</p>
<p>adopted by him when that document was read ? He
</p>
<p>called for the production of another article In the
</p>
<p>paper, which I expected would have some sort of re-
</p>
<p>ference to tills, and have beeii a qualification of it
</p>
<p>in some way. But what was it ? A love song 1
</p>
<p>You recollect the shouts of laughter which Mr.
</p>
<p>Whiteside elicited by this happy expedient. But,
</p>
<p>gentlemen cf the jury, I was certainly struck with
</p>
<p>very different feelings when I saw an attempt thus
</p>
<p>made to get rid of ^he effect of this piece of evi-
</p>
<p>dence. Gentlemen, I think you yourselves at the

</p>
<p>time must have been struck, I will not say with the
</p>
<p>impropriety, but certainly the irrelevancy, of that
</p>
<p>reading on the part of Mr. Dufly's, counsel. Well,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I dismiss that. Gentlemen, amongst
</p>
<p>the principal instruments by which the pm-poses of
</p>
<p>these parties were to be accomplished, were the re-
</p>
<p>peal wardens. We have proved a printed paper en-
</p>
<p>titled " Duties of the repeal wardens." I will not
</p>
<p>go into a detail of all those duties. The first is,
</p>
<p>" they are to divide the parishes."
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice CramptonWhat is the date of that ?
</p>
<p>So'.icitor-Geneval  Corn-Exchange, May, 1843,
</p>
<p>my lord. The second is, " to appoint as many col-
</p>
<p>lectors as he may deem necessary, to act with him,
</p>
<p>and to collect the repeal fund regularly witliin his
</p>
<p>district, from each individual willing to contributi2 a
</p>
<p>farthing a-week, a penny a-month, or a shilling a-
</p>
<p>year taking care to make every person favourable
</p>
<p>to the repeal understand, that unless he contributes
</p>
<p>to the amount of a shilling a-year his name cannot
</p>
<p>be enrolled as a repealer, and, therefore, he will be
</p>
<p>calculated upon by the enemies of Ireland as against
</p>
<p>the repeal !" It is my firm belief that many persons
</p>
<p>have been induced to subscribe to the funds of this
</p>
<p>association by coercion and intimidation. That
</p>
<p>such is the easel think highly probable, and I think
</p>
<p>the evidence here fully warrants me in entertaining
</p>
<p>that suspicion. Gentlemen, what is the meaning of
</p>
<p>having an unfortunate peasant held up by the re-
</p>
<p>peal wardens of his district as an enemy to his coun-
</p>
<p>try ? Can a person thus denounced appear or show
</p>
<p>himself ? Can he do so with safety to his person ?
</p>
<p>It is accordingly one of the duties of these repeal
</p>
<p>wardens to inculcate on the peasantry of the country

</p>
<p>pres^ion of public opinion. It is true troops 1 ave
</p>
<p>been sent into the country. Has it not appeared
</p>
<p>here, that that was causerl by this association, by
</p>
<p>the appreliensions entertained by persons, -wlietber
</p>
<p>well or ill-founded is not the question  that this
</p>
<p>agitaiion might not terminate peaceably ?* Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, I come now to the first of what are called
</p>
<p>"monster meetings." This fir.st meeting, which
</p>
<p>was at MuUinpar, appears to have taken place on
</p>
<p>the 14th of May, 1843. Gentlemen, I will not
</p>
<p>trouble you with the details for the preparation
</p>
<p>of this meeting. I shall, however, .iust make this
</p>
<p>remark with respect to the temperance bands. I
</p>
<p>deepl.y regret that such a use has been made of them
</p>
<p>as appears in the course of this trial to have been
</p>
<p>made. I think, gentlemen, there never was a greater
</p>
<p>blessing to this country than the extraordinary re-
</p>
<p>formation, of whi('h the Eeverend Father Mathew
</p>
<p>was the author ; and it is greatlj- to be deplored that
</p>
<p>mauy well-meaning persons have been deterred from
</p>
<p>expressing the approbation, which I have no doubt
</p>
<p>tbcy must have felt, of that great improvement, by
</p>
<p>the dread that their motives might be misconstrued,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the purposes to which these tem-
</p>
<p>perance bands have been applied. f I am fully sa-
</p>
<p>tisfied that the reverend gentleman, to whom we are
</p>
<p>indebted for this great moral change, never intended
</p>
<p>or contemplated that anything connected with it
</p>
<p>should be so perverted. I greatly regret that a
</p>
<p>measure calculated to work out such good results, is
</p>
<p>liable to be thwarted to such a degi'ee by the effects
</p>
<p>of the abuse to which I have adverted. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>at that meeting of the 14th of May, one of the tra-
</p>
<p>versers, Mr. Barrett, took a conspicuous part. He

</p>
<p>says, in speaking of the union  " No demon could,
</p>
<p>in diabolical cunning, invent one more calculated to
</p>
<p>perpetuate religious discord  a system in which
</p>
<p>hypocrisy is made a science, and bigotry a trade, in
</p>
<p>which the name of heaven is invoked to let loose
</p>
<p>the furies of hell." Then he goes on again  " They
</p>
<p>have proved already that Ireland is of one mind,
</p>
<p>and that mind repeal. Can they unrcpeal us by
</p>
<p>silencing us ?" What had been said about silencing ?
</p>
<p>On the contrary had it not been said expressly that
</p>
<p>until the ordinary powers of the law had been tried
</p>
<p>and failed, no gagging bill, or coercion bill, or
</p>
<p>silencing bill, would be introduced into parliament?
</p>
<p>It is a gross perversion to put that construction on
</p>
<p>the language of Sir Robert Peel which Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>liad thought fit to fix upon it. " How will they
</p>
<p>destroy that admitted fact, or efface its record ? We
</p>
<p>may be silent, but all the time it will be the silence
</p>
<p>of the old woman's cow  we shall be the devil for
</p>
<p>thinking." You all remember the dramatic effect
</p>
<p>produced by Mr. Whiteside in commenting on this
</p>
<p>part of Mr. Ban-ett's speech. He dwelt on the word
</p>
<p>"cow," but he forgot the words "crouch of the
</p>
<p>tiger," and he did not say much on " the sure but
</p>
<p>terrible spring." Gentlemen, what is the meaning
</p>
<p>of that language ? It says, we are silent for the
</p>
<p>present ; true, but what is that silence ? It is the
</p>
<p>silence of that determination and preparation which,
</p>
<p>when the proper season arrives, will enable us to
</p>
<p>take that " sure, but terrible spring," that will effect
</p>
<p>the independence of our country. Gentlemen, this
</p>
<p>is figurative language, but it is sufficiently intelli-
</p>
<p>gible. " Come what may, the die is cast!" Then,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, we proceed to the meeting at Longford,

<p>bonrs. Have I not proof of both in that very speech?
</p>
<p>Observe that no comment whatever has been made
</p>
<p>by the defendants' counsel on this passage ; it was
</p>
<p>passed over as a mere personal attack on Lord Beau-
</p>
<p>mont. It is the suggestion of firing Lord Beaumont's
</p>
<p>castle, and the manufactories in England, which
</p>
<p>contains the sting of this speech ; and yet tliat is
</p>
<p>wholly passed by. Assume for a moment  give Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell the credit  that lie did not really mean to
</p>
<p>suggest to the people of this country the diabolical
</p>
<p>project of firing the manufactories, would not the
</p>
<p>necessary effect of this speech be, at all events, to
</p>
<p>excite a feeling of alarm, and give cause for appre-
</p>
<p>hension to the people of England, that if any attempt
</p>
<p>were made to maintain the union, in opposition to a
</p>
<p>violent movement, such consequences might ensue ?
</p>
<p>If that were the object, that object was intimidation ;
</p>
<p>and that is wliat we insist on in this case. I do not
</p>
<p>go the length of saying, that Mr. O'Connell intended
</p>
<p>that such a project as that should be carried into
</p>
<p>actual execution. In the Freeman's Journal of the
</p>
<p>3Ist of May, we have tlie proceedings of the associa-
</p>
<p>tion on the preceding day, the 30th May ; and I must
</p>
<p>call your attention, in this stage of the case, to part
</p>
<p>of the evidence which was read in Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>justification  part, in fact, of his defence. It appears,
</p>
<p>that upon this occasion, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Mr. Kay, and others, were present. Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>stated, on this occasion, that a certain sum had
</p>
<p>been handed in ; Mr. Ray read certain letters, and
</p>
<p>then Mr. O'Connell corrects the report of his speech
</p>
<p>at Longford, and says  " He had to correct a typo-
</p>
<p>grapliical mistake which occurred in the admirable

<p>Longford. He was made to say this, 'No, your
</p>
<p>sister watched his corpse, but she is herself worse
</p>
<p>than dead  she is now a sad maniac roaming tlirougli
</p>
<p>the wilds, and, like the wretched maniac of song,
</p>
<p>warning her sex against the ruffian soldiery of Bri-
</p>
<p>tain.' He did not call the soldiery of Britain a ruffian
</p>
<p>soldiery  he would not call them so, because it would
</p>
<p>be false. They never now saw a soldier in the dock, and
</p>
<p>he would be wronging liis judgment if he called them
</p>
<p>a ruffian soldiery. He also spoke of the sergeants,
</p>
<p>whom he tliought an exceedingly well-informed and
</p>
<p>well-conducted body of men, and to tliem tlie disci-
</p>
<p>pline of the entire armyfell (hear). If justice were
</p>
<p>done to them, there was not a company, in which
</p>
<p>one of them ought not to be raised to tlie rank of an
</p>
<p>officer. The lines he made use of were the following.
</p>
<p>[Then he quotes the lines in the speech.]" That is
</p>
<p>the first allusion Mr. O'Connell appears to have
</p>
<p>made to the army. When that paper was read, Mr.
</p>
<p>Whiteside (I believe) requested that the speech
</p>
<p>which Mr. O'Connell delivered at a subsequent part
</p>
<p>of the proceedings should be read ; and, accordingly,
</p>
<p>that speech of Mr. O'Connell was then read at great
</p>
<p>length, and I beg leave to call your attention to one
</p>
<p>or two passages of it. After saying this was tlie
</p>
<p>repeal year, he says  " Who could have thought
</p>
<p>that they would be able to bully Wellington and
</p>
<p>Peel  for they had bullied them out of the coercion
</p>
<p>bill?"  alluding to Sir Robert Peel's declar.ation
</p>
<p>that he would not resort to a coercion bill, unless all
</p>
<p>ordinary remedies failed. " Who could have thought
</p>
<p>that they would be able to bully Wellington and
</p>
<p>Peel  ^for they liad bullied them out of the coercion
</p>
<p>bill  that they would laugh to scorn the unconsti-

</p>
<p>had toll! them yet, and he called upon them to give
</p>
<p>three cheers for the Queen's army  the bravest
</p>
<p>army in the world. To the army they would give
</p>
<p>civility, and in return they would get nothing but
</p>
<p>civihty from them." Then he goes on:  "This
</p>
<p>proved the kindly feelings that were entertained by
</p>
<p>the peasantry towards the army ; and he, for one,
</p>
<p>regarded their arrival as a matter rather for gratu-
</p>
<p>lation than anything else." To these and such
</p>
<p>passages in the speeches at the great meetings, this
</p>
<p>observation is, generally speaking, applicable, that
</p>
<p>they are of a more mitigated character considerably
</p>
<p>than those made at the dinners. At that dinner at
</p>
<p>Drogheda, Mr. O'ConneU made another speech, to
</p>
<p>some parts of which it will be necessary for me to
</p>
<p>direct your attention. Mr. Barrett, it appears, was
</p>
<p>at this dinner. He responded to the toast of " The
</p>
<p>People." He says  "But let them bew.are how
</p>
<p>they, by aggression, put the people in the right,
</p>
<p>and cause a simultaneous and universal outbreak.
</p>
<p>Mere men of office cannot comprehend the power of
</p>
<p>the people. Jlilitary tacticians are out of their
</p>
<p>element in such a warfare. Office men or veterans
</p>
<p>never suspected that the Swiss peasantry would be
</p>
<p>capiible of throwing off the yoke of Austria. The
</p>
<p>boys of Paris won the three d.ays. Belgium threw
</p>
<p>off the yoke of Hollaud, through what martinets
</p>
<p>would call an undisciplined rabble. The women of
</p>
<p>Paris took the Bastile. Even iu that cxccr.able
</p>
<p>French Revolution there was one redeeming trait
</p>
<p>that enthusiasm set at nought all the old military
</p>
<p>calculations, and surmounted what were deemed ob-
</p>
<p>stacles pliysically incompatible with success. Was
</p>
<p>there ever a country so circumstanced as Ireland for

</p>
<p>repelling aggression?" Now, this is the language
</p>
<p>uniformly used  " repelling aggression 1" " With a
</p>
<p>numerous, brave, sober, and multitudinous people
</p>
<p>every mountain a citadel, every hill a fort, every
</p>
<p>ditch a breast-work, every valley a ravine a coun-
</p>
<p>try in which cannon or cavalry could not act, and
</p>
<p>where all warfare must inevitably be irregular, with
</p>
<p>nothing to lose, and everything to gain by a strug-
</p>
<p>gle  are they mad who would wantonly provoke
</p>
<p>it?" Is this Language, or is it not, calculated to
</p>
<p>intimidate the people of Kngland, as to the state of
</p>
<p>this country, and the probability of a simultaneous
</p>
<p>outbreak at any moment wlien the leaders tliought
</p>
<p>fit to give the signal. Gentlemen of the jury, Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele's is the next speech to which I call your at-
</p>
<p>tention. Mr. Steele says:  "He renewed his de-
</p>
<p>nunciation of Wellington and Peel, and of Crom-
</p>
<p>well's memory." And concluded by saying that
</p>
<p>"If Ireland .and Ireland's leader were compelled to
</p>
<p>resistance, that as he (Mr. Steele) had for so many
</p>
<p>years, above all others, laboured to keep the peace
</p>
<p>of Ireland, he would in that case find it a duty to
</p>
<p>his country, and to his own character, to solicit
</p>
<p>from his august friend, O'ConneU, that he would
</p>
<p>appoint him to the leadersliip of whatever enter-
</p>
<p>prises were the most desperate, to set an example to
</p>
<p>the Irish, and give proof to the Irish, that although
</p>
<p>for years he had been keeping the peace of the
</p>
<p>country, he was ready to share their dangers, if
</p>
<p>Ireland was driven to extremity by the Oliver
</p>
<p>Cromwells of the day."
</p>
<p>Mr. Steele  If driven to resistance.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  I have no doubt that Mr.
</p>
<p>Steele most sincerely expressed those sentiments.

<p>judgment, in page 571 2, is quite decisive, in my
</p>
<p>opinion, to show that this illegal purpose was what
</p>
<p>made the assonihly unlawful ; and that the count
</p>
<p>was supported and held good, as liaving in that
</p>
<p>way sufficiently charged an illegal act. Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, I shall now resume the consideration of
</p>
<p>the evidence on the part of the crown. The next
</p>
<p>meeting to which it will be necessary to advert, is a
</p>
<p>meeting which was held at Kilkenny on the 8th of
</p>
<p>June. The proceedings at that meeting have been
</p>
<p>read from the Pilot newspaper of the I2th of June,
</p>
<p>1843. There is a long description of the number
</p>
<p>of persons who attended, with the banners, flags,
</p>
<p>music, and soforth ; and then, gentlemen, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell made a speech, to one part of which Ire-
</p>
<p>quest your attention. He says  " I nowcharge the
</p>
<p>repeal wardens, who are established in every parish
</p>
<p>in the county, to find out for me any attempt to esta-
</p>
<p>blish secret societies in the country. I suppose
</p>
<p>you have heard of the Duke of Wellington and Sir
</p>
<p>Kobert I'eel having come down to parliament one
</p>
<p>fine evening, and declaring that they would prevent
</p>
<p>the repeal of the union, even at the expense of a
</p>
<p>civil war." The allusion to civil war, you will re-
</p>
<p>collect, was originally made so far back as the year
</p>
<p>1834, not by tlie members of the present administra-
</p>
<p>tion, but by certain members of the administration
</p>
<p>of that day. I stated to j-ou yesterday, what ap-
</p>
<p>pears to me the fair construction of Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Peel's declaration in the house of commons on the

<p>Mr. Shell  I beg your pardon. I yesterday ex-
</p>
<p>pressed my extreme reluctance to interrupt the So-
</p>
<p>licitor-General, and that reluctance arises from the
</p>
<p>circumstance that I myself, as counsel for a traver-
</p>
<p>ser, li.ad not been interrupted, and I feel that very
</p>
<p>considerable latitude was allowed us. But perhaps
</p>
<p>it will be recollected, that the case of the traversers
</p>
<p>and the case of the prosecutors are very distinct,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, considerable latitude is allowed to the
</p>
<p>counsel for the traversers. On ihe other hand, the
</p>
<p>counsel for the crown are generally considered to be
</p>
<p>bound by the strict rules of evidence ; especially the
</p>
<p>counsel who has the last word, and who winds up,
</p>
<p>is supposed to advert to that which is only in procf.
</p>
<p>My learned friend will pardon me for saying, not
</p>
<p>only yesterday he went far indeed out of the evi-
</p>
<p>dence, but at present he is adverting to topics
</p>
<p>which are not in proof, and which are entirely ille-
</p>
<p>gitimate.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  I am not aware that I
</p>
<p>have adverted to any topic that has not been dis-
</p>
<p>cussed, or any fact not in proof.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Cramplon  You were saying some-
</p>
<p>thing about the year 1834.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheil  And the speeches of Sir Robert Peel,
</p>
<p>which are not in evidence. I shall interrupt him
</p>
<p>once more  and not again. I must say, I admit
</p>
<p>that great indulgence was allowed to myself by the
</p>
<p>crown, and that I m.ake this remark solely from a
</p>
<p>sense of duty, and I m.ake it with the utmost dis-
</p>
<p>trust, and with great reluctance. I think the So-
</p>
<p>licitor-General has no right to advert to the motives
</p>
<p>expressed by Sir Robert Peel in parliament for his
</p>
<p>conduct. I think, yesterday, he had no right to
</p>
<p>THE SOLTCITOR-GENEEAL'S REPLY.
</p>
<p>423
</p>
<p>verdict, unless tlie court aro of opinion that the law-
</p>
<p>has been violated ; and Svhat I mean to say is merely
</p>
<p>thisi that we are now bringing to issue the question
</p>
<p>whether, tliere. has. .been a violation of the common
</p>
<p>law. Now,' gentlemen; Mr. O'Connell goes, on:
</p>
<p>" We will not go to war with them, but let them
</p>
<p>not dare to go to war with us. We will act on the
</p>
<p>defensive ; and believe me, men of Kilkenny, there
</p>
<p>is no power, in Europe that would dare attack you
</p>
<p>and the people of Ireland, when they keep them-
</p>
<p>selves in the right, and act on the defensive only."
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen of the jury, when we hear' so
</p>
<p>much said about the concentration of moral force,
</p>
<p>and the union of public opinion, I must be allowed
</p>
<p>to call your attention to the language that has been
</p>
<p>addressed to these meetings by Mr. O'Connell ; and
</p>
<p>see if you can reconcile that to any other- view of
</p>
<p>the case than this, eitlier that Ije intended these per-
</p>
<p>sons should understand that they were to be in a si-
</p>
<p>tuation tobe disciplined, or else that, he wished itto
</p>
<p>be understood in England that such was thestate of
</p>
<p>organization amongst the masses of people in this
</p>
<p>country, that it would not be safe to refuse the repeal
</p>
<p>of the union. He proceeds  " Do you not think
</p>
<p>they were as well able to walk in order after a band
</p>
<p>as if they wore red coats, and that they Would be as
</p>
<p>rea.dy to obey their repeal wardens., as if they were
</p>
<p>called sergeants and captains." This, I am told,
</p>
<p>was ho allusion whatever to anything like physical
</p>
<p>iforce. Gentlemen, I think it is needless forme to
</p>
<p>dwell further on that observation. The words must
</p>
<p>have reference to physical force, and nothing! else.
</p>
<p>Well; gentlemen, we have now a meeting, at which,
</p>
<p>if possible, the same thing was more clearly and un-

</p>
<p>equivocally admitted ; I mean, gentlemen, the meet-
</p>
<p>ing at Mallow, which took place on the 1 1 tli of June.
</p>
<p>Mr, Jolly, who was present at part of the transac-
</p>
<p>tion, says  "He is head constable in, the East
</p>
<p>Kiding of Cork, and that he was at this, meeting on
</p>
<p>the 11th of June, in plain' clothes." He took no
</p>
<p>notes, but he does, from memory, state part of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's speech :  " They sent the soldiers to
</p>
<p>shoot them. The sergeants were the finest .body of
</p>
<p>men' in the world, biit the worst treated. That the
</p>
<p>French sergeants were generally raised to the rank
</p>
<p>of officers. They were better treated than the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish by being promoted. He was telling the crowd
</p>
<p>the effects of the repeal of the union.; that the la-
</p>
<p>bourers would be farmers, the farmers gentlemen,
</p>
<p>and the gentlemeri meiiibers of parliament." This,
</p>
<p>gentl'emen, was laughed at ; but it is the very same
</p>
<p>sort of language, you will find, that Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>has confessedly used on other occasions. Now, with,
</p>
<p>respect to Mr. O'Connell's language on this occasion,
</p>
<p>jt also appears in the newspaper of the 12th of June,
</p>
<p>and he says:  " I speak with the awful determina-
</p>
<p>tion with which 1 commenced my address, in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the news received this day. 'There was
</p>
<p>no house of commons on Thursd.ay, for the cabinet
</p>
<p>were considering whatthey should do  not for Ire-
</p>
<p>land, but against her. . But as long as they leave us
</p>
<p>a rag of the constitution, we will stand on it. We
</p>
<p>will violate no law, we will assail no enemy ; hut
</p>
<p>you are much mistaken' if you think others will not
</p>
<p>assail you. (A voice^-' We are ready to meet
</p>
<p>them.') To be sure you are.' Do you think that I
</p>
<p>suppose you to be cowards or fools ?, If they as-
</p>
<p>sailed us to-morrow, and that we conquered them,

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>complete justice, I would tell her by way of answer
</p>
<p>a story of a fool of Kerry  where there are not
</p>
<p>many of tliem. This fool found a hen's nest, and
</p>
<p>having turned the hen off, lie set about eating the
</p>
<p>eggs ; as the first was going down his throat, a
</p>
<p>chicken squeaked, upon which the fool said, ' Ah !
</p>
<p>you speak too late.'" Observe the ajiplication of
</p>
<p>the story. " Now we know how to suck eggs as
</p>
<p>well as the Kerry fool ; and if England now tells
</p>
<p>me, that she isready to do us justice, I will say to her,
</p>
<p>with the fool of Kerry, you speak too late 1" Here is
</p>
<p>interminable hostility proclaimed. He then says 
</p>
<p>"The Irish parliament is not dead; it only sleeps.
</p>
<p>The royal prerogative remains untouched, and the
</p>
<p>Queen might come over to-morrow and issue writs
</p>
<p>out of chancery for electing an Irish parliament.
</p>
<p>She has the same right to do so as James, who issued
</p>
<p>forty writs in one day. The Queen could issue
</p>
<p>writs, and the people would act upon them, and thus
</p>
<p>the Irish parliament would be re-created propria
</p>
<p>vigoTn, without any reference to Saxon authority.
</p>
<p>Saxons, I tell you that the moment the Queen shall be
</p>
<p>convinced that she has the right to do that, we shall
</p>
<p>have the repeal of the union, without troubling you at
</p>
<p>all." The people who attended these meetings had
</p>
<p>been instructed by Mr. O'Connell, that the Queen is
</p>
<p>anxious for them, and favourable to them ; and he
</p>
<p>now lays down the law to them, that it is not ne-
</p>
<p>cessary, in order to elfectuate the restor.ation of the
</p>
<p>Irish parliament, that the English parliament (or
</p>
<p>the Saxon parliament as he terms it) should be re-
</p>
<p>sorted to, but that when her Majesty is convinced, as
</p>
<p>she is disposed to be, that it ought to be done, there
</p>
<p>is no objection to issuing writs, and thereby calling

</p>
<p>together the Irish parliament again. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>this brings me to the consideration of the proposi-
</p>
<p>tion, whether it is consistent with the law of this
</p>
<p>land to say, that the Queen, or the Sovereign, can
</p>
<p>reconstruct the separate p.arliament of Ireland, by
</p>
<p>the mere exercise of the royal prerogative in issuing
</p>
<p>writs to such places in Ireland as her Majesty may
</p>
<p>think proper. 1 think that I shall have very little
</p>
<p>difSculty in demonstrating to their lordships, Vifho I
</p>
<p>take for granted will lay down the law so to you,
</p>
<p>that Mr. O'Connell's doctrine is a total perversion
</p>
<p>of the law. It is altogether unsupported by any
</p>
<p>legal principle; it is directh' adverse to the best
</p>
<p>established rules of our law ; it is wholly untenable;
</p>
<p>and the result of it would be to render void all the
</p>
<p>acts of parliament which have passed since the
</p>
<p>union. Gentlemen, it was not, as I could collect,
</p>
<p>exactly said that the uuion was void in point of law,
</p>
<p>but some passages were read from speeches of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, from which it was inferred that Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell's doctrine was, not that the union was
</p>
<p>not binding in point of law, but that it was not
</p>
<p>binding in point of conscience, or wliat is called
</p>
<p>constitutional principle. I do not profess exactly to
</p>
<p>understand what is meant by constitutional princi-
</p>
<p>ple as contra-distinguished and different from law.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the precedent that is urged in support
</p>
<p>of this view of the law, is the issuing by King James
</p>
<p>of certain writs to boroughs, forty in number, in one
</p>
<p>day. Prom this it is sought to be argued, that, at
</p>
<p>any time, it is now in the power of the crown to
</p>
<p>exercise the same prerogative, and to issue writs of
</p>
<p>the same description. The occasion upon which
</p>
<p>those writs were issued was simply this : up to that

<p>pose of electing any person or persons to serre or

<p>act, or be considered as representative orrepresenta-
</p>
<p>tives of any other place, town, or city, corporation
</p>
<p>or borough other than the aforesaid, or as the re-
</p>
<p>presentative or representatives of the freemen, free-
</p>
<p>holders, liouseliolders, or inhabitants thereof, either
</p>
<p>in the parliament of the United Kingdom or else-
</p>
<p>where, unless it shall hereafter be otherwise pro-
</p>
<p>vided by the parliament of the United Kingdom."
</p>
<p>Here we liave an explicit and direct enactment tliat
</p>
<p>no meeting shall be convened, nor shall any person
</p>
<p>be elected or considered as the representative of any
</p>
<p>of the places included in this act of parliament,
</p>
<p>cither in the united parliament or elsewhere, except
</p>
<p>according to the provisions of that act. Yet, Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell pretends to say that the Queen has the
</p>
<p>power of issuing writs to call together an Irish pai-
</p>
<p>liament, because, as he says, that parliament is not
</p>
<p>de.ad but sleeps ; because it is still in constitutional
</p>
<p>and legal existence, though not actually called to
</p>
<p>meet. That is his proposition. This supposes that
</p>
<p>the act of union is altogether void ; that is, in effect,
</p>
<p>the meaning. You will recollect, gentlemen, that
</p>
<p>amongst the documents they handed in. was an ad-
</p>
<p>dress to the people of Ireland, by the repeal associa-
</p>
<p>tion at its first establishment. To this address is
</p>
<p>prefixed a dedication by Mr. O'Connell, in which he
</p>
<p>snys "They were written by one of yourselves for
</p>
<p>tlie benefit of you all." In this publication, I find
</p>
<p>the doctrine with respect to the union laid down
</p>
<p>thus : " Besides all this, it is perfectly clear that
</p>
<p>the Irish parliament had no right whatever to vote
</p>
<p>away tlieir country's independence." Then he cites
</p>
<p>Lord Plunket's words, and Mr. Saurin's. " Sucli

</p>
<p>were the means by which the union was carried ;
</p>
<p>and such was the inherent radical defect in point of
</p>
<p>law, and in conscience, in that measure." What
</p>
<p>will be said to that? Is that, or is it not, a deliberate
</p>
<p>assertion circulated amongst the people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>that by reason of the inherent want of legal power
</p>
<p>and capacity in the respective legislatures, and par-
</p>
<p>ticularly in the Irish legislature, to pass the union,
</p>
<p>it was void in point of law and of conscience ? Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, I mentioned to j-ou that one of the objects
</p>
<p>of these parties was to persuade the people of Ire-
</p>
<p>land, and to keep them in the delusion, that the
</p>
<p>Queen had the power, and also the inclination, to
</p>
<p>further their wishes, by having the union in fact re-
</p>
<p>pealed. Gentlemen, he by whom that is cited, and
</p>
<p>his counsel, have repeatedly relied on certain ex-
</p>
<p>pressions used  not by lawyers as such, not by
</p>
<p>judges, not by any persons having authority to lay
</p>
<p>down the law, but by certain members of the Irish
</p>
<p>parliament before the union was passed, and wlulst
</p>
<p>the propriety of passing that measure was under
</p>
<p>discussion. These are held up as the authoritative
</p>
<p>declarations of those eminent men as lawyers and as
</p>
<p>judges, that after the union was passed, it had no
</p>
<p>binding power, by reason of the alleged incapacity
</p>
<p>of the Irish parliament to annihilate the separate
</p>
<p>legislatures of Ireland. I say, gentlemen, a more se-
</p>
<p>ditious doctrine than this cannot possibly be broached.
</p>
<p>I say it is illegal and delusive. It is absurd and
</p>
<p>monstrous to say, that in point of either law, or of
</p>
<p>conscience, or of constitutional principle (I do not
</p>
<p>care on what ground it is put), the union can be
</p>
<p>considered as void. I say it is unconstitutional, se-
</p>
<p>ditious, and unlawful, to tell any of the Queen's

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>He denounces the ribbon society, and all secret
</p>
<p>societies (I admit tliat), on all occasions. " Let
</p>
<p>every man that promises me he will catch a ribbou-
</p>
<p>mau hold up his hand. Oh ! now I hare your
</p>
<p>pledge, and no honest Irishman ever broke his
</p>
<p>pledge. Have I not teetotallers here? ('Yes.') I
</p>
<p>am proud of your confidence ; I can collect you
</p>
<p>together at any time. If I want you, I can get you
</p>
<p>any day in the week." Now it is possible that these
</p>
<p>words may have different meanings. It is for you
</p>
<p>to say what they mean : whether Mr. O'Connell in-
</p>
<p>tended to call these people together when an occa-
</p>
<p>sion should arrive for an outbreak, or whether lie
</p>
<p>Intended to have it understood in England, and over
</p>
<p>the country, that the people could be collected at
</p>
<p>any moment he thought fit, so as therefore to create
</p>
<p>that kind of coercion or intimidation, which we say
</p>
<p>he had in contemplation, as a means of procuring
</p>
<p>the repeal of the union. Gentlemen, with regard to
</p>
<p>the Tullamore meeting, there was the evidence of
</p>
<p>a person of the name of Stewart, and other evidence
</p>
<p>with respect to which it will be necessary for me
</p>
<p>just to make a few observations. You will recollect
</p>
<p>that Mr. Stewart stated, that amongst the insignia,
</p>
<p>or banners, or inscriptions, wliich appeared at Tul-
</p>
<p>lamore, was one upon an arch  " Ireland her par-
</p>
<p>liament, or the world in a blaze." The counsel for
</p>
<p>the traversers, when adverting to this meeting, said,
</p>
<p>" Oh ! we shall show that this was wholly without
</p>
<p>the knowledge of Mr. O'Connell; and so far from
</p>
<p>approving of it, he, Mr. O'Connell directel it to

<p>he taken down ; and Mr. Steele accordingly went
</p>
<p>and had it removed  insisted on its being taken
</p>
<p>away, and it was removed accordingly." Gentle-

<p>men of the jury, a person was called by the traver-
</p>
<p>sers, I do not now remember his name, Morgan, I
</p>
<p>believe it was, who certainly did prove that he took
</p>
<p>down, or assisted in taking down, this arch by the
</p>
<p>direction of Mr. Steele, about a quarter past eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock ; and that accordingly it was removed. But
</p>
<p>what appeared on the cross-examination of that
</p>
<p>man? He was asked, who put up this arch?
</p>
<p>Where was it ? It was at the house, or opposite
</p>
<p>the house, of a painter of the name of Dean. Dean
</p>
<p>painted it, and put it up. Why did he do so ? The
</p>
<p>witness could not tell. Who desired him to do so ?
</p>
<p>He could not tell.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  There is no evidence that
</p>
<p>Dean painted it or put it up.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  The only evidence is, that it was
</p>
<p>suspended from an empty house of his.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I do not think he said any
</p>
<p>thing about it being suspended from anempty house.
</p>
<p>Jtr. Fitzgibbon  He said so, my lord.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-Genera!  Therefore, I say. Dean
</p>
<p>was the person that had authority to take it down,
</p>
<p>and was applied to to take it down, and Dean re-
</p>
<p>fused to take it down until sanctioned by Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's desire. On his cross-examination what turned
</p>
<p>out ? That that very Dean had came from Tulla-
</p>
<p>more with him (Morgan) the night before, and was
</p>
<p>in town  and where is Dean ? Had Dean been
</p>
<p>produced, and not Morgan, Dean could have told
</p>
<p>you by whose authority or direction, or for what
</p>
<p>reason, and at whose expense, this inscription was
</p>
<p>put up ; why it was put up ; who he. Dean, was 
</p>
<p>whether he was connected with the association.

<p>at his word ? (cries of ' To be sure we would.') Let

<p>every man who was determined to meet him again
</p>
<p>on any future occasion, where he would require his
</p>
<p>presence, for peaceable purposes, hold up his hand.
</p>
<p>(A myriad of hands were uplifted amid loud and
</p>
<p>general applause.)" Gentlemen, at the dinner, on
</p>
<p>this occasion, Mr. O'Connell made a speech. " Ire-
</p>
<p>land wants all her sous to stand by her at the pre-
</p>
<p>sent moment (great cheers) ; and if they have no
</p>
<p>other or better leader than myself, I will myself
</p>
<p>stand by the people and the people will stand by me
</p>
<p>(tremendous cheering)." Does that allude to the
</p>
<p>presenting of petitions to the parliament for the re-
</p>
<p>peal of the act of legislative union ? Does he mean
</p>
<p>a leader in the house of commons ? Does he mean
</p>
<p>a leader in signing petitions ? Or does he mean a
</p>
<p>loader in tlie field? How was this understood?
</p>
<p>" (Tremendous cheering. A voice  ' That will do.')
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell  Yes, that will do (cheers). You
</p>
<p>know that I will not allow you to violate any law.
</p>
<p>If my advice be taken, you will not be in the power
</p>
<p>of your enemies." Gentlemen, I shall not further
</p>
<p>dwell on that meeting. EecoUect, that the question
</p>
<p>with respect to all these proceedings is, what is the
</p>
<p>object that the parties had in view ? Kow, bearing
</p>
<p>that in mind, I must call j'onr attention to the next
</p>
<p>piece of evidence in point of date, which is a publi-
</p>
<p>;ation of the 12th of August, in the Nation. It
</p>
<p>seems to be a leading article in that paper, adverting
</p>
<p>to the position of the repeal question at that time.
</p>
<p>The writer goes on:  "Let us see what has been
</p>
<p>done, and what remains."

<p>The Solicitor-General  Yes. [The learned gen-
</p>
<p>tleman quoted and commented on this article at
</p>
<p>great length, and continued] :  Now attend to this :
</p>
<p>it is said that the act of one person, or the declara-
</p>
<p>tion of one person, is only to be visited on liimself ;
</p>
<p>that it would be a cruel thing to visit upon Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray the act of Mr. O'Connell, or the speech of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell ; or on Mr. Duffy, the publication of Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray. Here we have, you will find. Dr. Gray most
</p>
<p>active in the arbitration part of this case. And
</p>
<p>here we have Mr. Duffy, in the Nation, publishing
</p>
<p>the article which I am now reading, containing this
</p>
<p>passage  " Arbitrators will be appointed in every
</p>
<p>barony." How did Mr. Duffy know that? How
</p>
<p>could he know it, except there was a community of
</p>
<p>purpose and design between him and Dr. Gray, and
</p>
<p>the other persons who were connected with getting
</p>
<p>up these arbitration courts ? I mention that as one
</p>
<p>of the thousand instances of the community of pur-
</p>
<p>pose in this case. Then again, he alludes to another
</p>
<p>subject, which you will presently find more fully
</p>
<p>developed in the combination, but which at this
</p>
<p>time the writer of this article certainly knew was
</p>
<p>in contemplation :  " How soon the three hundred
</p>
<p>trustees of the Irish fund will come to Dublin we
</p>
<p>need not anticipate. SuflSce it, they will come, and
</p>
<p>we fancy their advice will pass for law with the peo-
</p>
<p>ple." Now you will hear by and by what these
</p>
<p>three hundred trustees were intended to be ; and
</p>
<p>here you find Mr. Duffy telling the people of Ireland,
</p>
<p>that when these three hundred trustees shall have
</p>
<p>assembled in Dublin, he takes for granted that what
</p>
<p>they say will be law for the Irish people.

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>stances of the case, as relating to Mr. Tierney, so 1
</p>
<p>far make a distinction between him and tlie otlier
</p>
<p>traversers, as to autliorize tlie jury to take a more
</p>
<p>favourable view of his case than of the others, it is
</p>
<p>not for me to say ; but wlien tlie jury come to con-
</p>
<p>sider the facts and circumstances, which it is now
</p>
<p>my duty to call to their attention, they will see that
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney has, to a great extent, to a certain ex-
</p>
<p>tent at least, mixed himself up with the objects and
</p>
<p>purposes of this body. Gentlemen, with respect to
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney, you will recollect that a witness, of
</p>
<p>the name of M'Cann, w.as examined. Mr. M'Cann
</p>
<p>is a member of the constabulary force, and very
</p>
<p>strong observations were made tending to impeach
</p>
<p>his character and verai'ity. Now, it is perfectly
</p>
<p>plain, if you believe this witness's statement, that
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney was, to some extent, connected with
</p>
<p>that meeting, and that he had written to barristers
</p>
<p>to attend at it, and, until their answer was received,
</p>
<p>he could not tell M'Cann the exact day. He then
</p>
<p>said  " That the army could not be induced to
</p>
<p>bayonet their fellow-subjects, and that they would
</p>
<p>not be so easily led to bayonet their fellow-men for
</p>
<p>seeking a redress of their grievances peaceably.
</p>
<p>And he referred to what the army had done in
</p>
<p>Spain." This, the witness said, was on the 16th of
</p>
<p>June. Mr. Tierney said  " See what the army did
</p>
<p>in Spain." He talked of the association, and said 
</p>
<p>" If it failed in its object, it had done so much at
</p>
<p>least, that the country should get other measures
</p>
<p>than the bayonet. " He, M'Cann, was then cross-
</p>
<p>examined by Mr. Moore, the counsel for Mr. Tier-
</p>
<p>ney, and he stated that he took a note of this con-
</p>
<p>versation so far as related to the fixing of the day,

</p>
<p>because that he was to report to his superior officer,
</p>
<p>but he did not take a note as to what Mr. Tierney
</p>
<p>said as to the army in Spain, but he was perfectly
</p>
<p>positive the words were used. He then produced
</p>
<p>Ills note, and said it was taken on the 16th of June,
</p>
<p>the day of the conversation ; that he saw the diary
</p>
<p>into which he entered it shortly afterwards. And
</p>
<p>he said that Mr. Tierney had assisted him in keep-
</p>
<p>ing the peace, and in acquainting him with the
</p>
<p>names of certain offenders ; and I make no doubt
</p>
<p>whatever that Mr. Tierney would feel it his duty,
</p>
<p>and act on it, to assist in that, as far as he possibly
</p>
<p>could. The witness said he had not thought it ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to insert this conversation with Mr. Tierney
</p>
<p>in the diary, because it had no immediate reference
</p>
<p>or relation to the subject on which he was sent.
</p>
<p>Now, very strong comments were made upon this
</p>
<p>man's evidence, not merely because he did not in-
</p>
<p>sert this in the diary, but his veracity was assailed
</p>
<p>by Mr. Moore on this ground, that it was impossi-
</p>
<p>ble this transaction could have taken place, or that
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney should have so expressed himself, be-
</p>
<p>cause the transactions in Spain were not then known
</p>
<p>in Ireland. You will recollect this, gentlemen 
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said, if you look to the newspapers, the
</p>
<p>movement, or the pronouncement, had not taken
</p>
<p>place till the lltli, and the news of it had not ar-
</p>
<p>rived in Ireland till the 19th of June, and this con-
</p>
<p>versation took place on the 16th of June ; therefore
</p>
<p>this man must be swearing falsely. Now, that was
</p>
<p>a very strong aspersion to make on this person's
</p>
<p>character  a person occupying a situation in the
</p>
<p>constabulary  that he was stating what was not
</p>
<p>true, and could not have been true at the time. If

</p>
<p>tended. You will recollect that Captain Despard
</p>
<p>was examined, who attended there, not as a raagis-
</p>
<p>trate, but as an individual, and saw a good deal of
</p>
<p>what occurred. Gentlemen, I shall beg to trouble
</p>
<p>you first, with some parts of his evidence, and, next,
</p>
<p>to direct your attention to the very extraordinary
</p>
<p>mode which has been resorted to, for the purpose 
</p>
<p>1 do not know whether 1 should say of contradict-
</p>
<p>ing  but of neutralizing his evidence. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>a more intelligent witness, or a more respectable one.
</p>
<p>never appeared. He has been a distinguisheil ma-
</p>
<p>gistrate for many years in the county of Jleath.
</p>
<p>f Here the learned gentleman quoted the evidence
</p>
<p>respecting the Wexford men, referred to by Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon, in his speech for the defence.] Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Despard is a military man, and formed, tliere-
</p>
<p>fore, probably a very good judgment as to the
</p>
<p>number of persons assembled on tliat occasion. "I
</p>
<p>think I am under the mark. Tliere were about
</p>
<p>seven thousand horsemen. I counted nineteen b.ands.
</p>
<p>The meeting coucluded at about two o'clock, or half-
</p>
<p>past, when there was a sudden movement, and they
</p>
<p>went away in bodies of about twenty thousand
</p>
<p>each." Now, gentlemen of the jury, it was impos-
</p>
<p>sible not to be struck with the value and the weight
</p>
<p>of this testimony, on this part of the case; and ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, there was no kind of expedient that was
</p>
<p>not resorted to, for the purpose of neutralising that
</p>
<p>evidence. We have the different counsel taking up
</p>
<p>each and every of these distinct grounds, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of getting rid of Captain Despard's testi-
</p>
<p>mony. My friend, Mr. Hatchell, said, "It is a
</p>
<p>mere quiz; I know SUilmalier very well, it is a long
</p>
<p>way from Tara. This was some fellow who had

<p>hoaxed Captain Despard  it was aU a quiz ;" and he
</p>
<p>lioped to be able to produce the man ; so said Mr.
</p>
<p>Hatchell, or some one.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  No, certainly not.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  Buthehas not been called.
</p>
<p>Tliey forgot that. But what said Mr. Fitzgibbon ?
</p>
<p>(and this does infinite credit to his ingenuity)  Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon said, "Oh! Captain Despard is not
</p>
<p>corroborated. Major Westenra is not produced.
</p>
<p>There was a policeman of the name of Walker ; he
</p>
<p>is not produced." Now, I really was astonished, I
</p>
<p>must say, when I heard that solution given of this
</p>
<p>conversation ; that Walker and Westenra  (wlio
</p>
<p>were not produced, because it was not necessary to
</p>
<p>corroborate such a man as Captain Despard)  had
</p>
<p>actually concocted the scheme to get tliis fellow be-
</p>
<p>hind the ditch, and that the hoaxing conversation
</p>
<p>took place in order that Captain Despard might have
</p>
<p>a good story to tell in a court of justice. But, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of tlie jury, how does it appear that when
</p>
<p>this plot took place, any of these parties had any
</p>
<p>idea of a prosecution ? Do you suppose, that on
</p>
<p>the 15th of August last, they had any idea there
</p>
<p>was to be a prosecution in the following December ?
</p>
<p>Upon turning, however, to tlie Pilot of the 16th of
</p>
<p>August, 1843, describing this meeting, I find this
</p>
<p>passage  " This may seem impossible, but when we
</p>
<p>state, that to our own knowledge, beside the great
</p>
<p>bulk of the popul.ition in Dublin, and the counties
</p>
<p>of Leinster adjoining Meath and Westnicath, there
</p>
<p>were large numbers from Connaught and Ulster,
</p>
<p>and some from Munster." " Oh ! " says Mr. Hatchell,
</p>
<p>" it is impossible they should come from Wexford, it
</p>
<p>is too distant." Mr. Barrett gives you a very dis-

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>whilst I live, .allay it; but after my death there may
</p>
<p>not be a person who has the control over the masses
</p>
<p>that I have been able to exercise ; and, therefore, as
</p>
<p>Ions; as I live myself, there may be no such out-
</p>
<p>break." But he does not venture, gentlemen, to
</p>
<p>assure us of security longer than lie himself shall
</p>
<p>live ; ou the contrary. Gentlemen, Br. Gray ap-
</p>
<p>pears ti) have made a speech at this meeting, which,
</p>
<p>in my judgment, is sufficiently demonstrative of his
</p>
<p>conception as to the state of things, and what was
</p>
<p>in contemplation. He was called upon to return
</p>
<p>thanks to the toast of " The Press " and he said 
</p>
<p>"In one thing only am I compelled to differ from
</p>
<p>the observation that has fallen from our respected
</p>
<p>chairman. In giving the toast, he stated that the
</p>
<p>press was of no politics ; and I wish to correct the error
</p>
<p>by declaring on behalf of the national press of Ire-
</p>
<p>land, that the members of it were politicians in the
</p>
<p>strongest sense of the word. I had myself the honour
</p>
<p>of being among them that evening as a t;;iest, but 1
</p>
<p>feel that wherever I am I am an Irishman, and as an
</p>
<p>Irishman, I am ready to strike out boldly for the politi-
</p>
<p>cal liberty of my country. The repeal press was a po-
</p>
<p>litical press, but its politics were the politics of Ire-
</p>
<p>land ; and, steadily adhering to the course it had
</p>
<p>adopted, it would never deviate to the right hand or
</p>
<p>TO the left, till the people of that country were re-
</p>
<p>lieved from Saxon tyranny and oligarchic dominion.
</p>
<p>Every eye was fixed upon the council that day at
</p>
<p>Tara, and eagerly looked to its resolves. AVas it
</p>
<p>not a national council, in the most extended mean-
</p>
<p>ing of the phrase?. Had they not at their head the
</p>
<p>monarch of the Irish heart? Had they not the spi-
</p>
<p>ritual peers of the realm ? Bid not the lay peers

<p>aid by their counsel ? They had there, too, the
</p>
<p>clergy of the land, and the constitutional represen-
</p>
<p>tatives of the peojile Aye, and the people them-
</p>
<p>selves. As I this day strayed over the ruins of our
</p>
<p>past glory, I chanced to walk over the graves of tlie
</p>
<p>patriots of what I might call their own day." Now
</p>
<p>there is no inuendo here, I admit ; but I think it is
</p>
<p>not necessary to have an inuendo as to " the pa-
</p>
<p>triots of their own day" at Tara. " I could not
</p>
<p>find words to give expression to the emotions I
</p>
<p>felt, as I contemplated their sad fate. A sorrowful
</p>
<p>chill came upon me when I looked upon their rest-
</p>
<p>ing-place, and saw in their end the dark history of
</p>
<p>the past. But that chill passed away, and hope re-
</p>
<p>vived, when I saw that upon their graves the stone
</p>
<p>of destiny stood erect. For centuries had that mys-
</p>
<p>terious relic been prostrate, as the land whose des-
</p>
<p>tiny its fall symbolised ; but now that I see it erect
</p>
<p>again, and on Tara's hill, and over the patriots'
</p>
<p>grave, I feel that the blood of the last martyr had
</p>
<p>been shed, and that Ireland herself would soon as-
</p>
<p>sume the upright position, and exhibit the dignity
</p>
<p>of a nation (loud cheers)."

</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  Gentlemen, I now come

<p>to certain transactions, which took place at the

<p>meeting of the association, I think upon the 'i2d of

<p>August. Mr. Jackson jjroved that he attended at
</p>
<p>that meeting, and that several documents or copies
</p>
<p>were handed to him, by the secretary or officer of
</p>
<p>the association. Amongst these was a paper en-
</p>
<p>titled " Plan for the renewed action of the Irish par-
</p>
<p>liament." Mr. O'Coniiell, at the meeting, when
</p>
<p>this was brought forward, introduced it by some ob-

</p>
<p>ing landlords of the right of recovering rent unless
</p>
<p>they give leases for Certain periods. Well, -geutle-
</p>
<p>meil, then follows a schedule, in which the popular
</p>
<p>tion returns are- referred to, and a, great number of
</p>
<p>towns are inserted in alphabetical order, with their
</p>
<p>respective uurah.ers of inhabitants, and the number
</p>
<p>of members they are to return ; and- in this way the
</p>
<p>total mernbers foT cities and towns amount to one
</p>
<p>hundred, and twenty-seven, arid 'for counties one
</p>
<p>hundred and seventy-three, making three hundred.
</p>
<p>So far as the fixing the number pf members of the
</p>
<p>house of commons, we have satisfactory information.
</p>
<p>Then, gentlemen, comes another item ; and tliat is
</p>
<p>the constitution of the house, and how these three
</p>
<p>hundred persons are to be returned. To meet that
</p>
<p>part of tlife matter^-" It is proposed that the right of
</p>
<p>TOting should be what is. called household suffrage,
</p>
<p>requiring six months' residence ip the counties, with
</p>
<p>the addition in the towns of married men resident
</p>
<p>for tjvelve months, .whether householders or not.
</p>
<p>It is proposed- that the mode of voting for members
</p>
<p>of parliament should certainly be by ballot." What
</p>
<p>do. you'suppose, gentlemen, would be the legislation
</p>
<p>of an assembly, composed of three hundred mem-
</p>
<p>bers, returned in this manner? Provision is next

</p>
<p>what would fetter the new 'parliament, or prevent

<p>it, if the case should actually arise, from altering

<p>THE IRISH STATE TKIALS.
</p>
<p>tem is to be carried on :  " Being further of opinion
</p>
<p>that the system of arbitration sliould be as univer-
</p>
<p>sally applied as the circumstances of each locality
</p>
<p>will admit, j'our committee recomraeno that for that
</p>
<p>purpose the several counties be apportioned into
</p>
<p>districts, and that three or more arbitrators be re-
</p>
<p>commended for each district, tlie number to be de-
</p>
<p>termined by the extent, population, and such other
</p>
<p>local circumstances as may seem to bear directly
</p>
<p>thereon." What is tlic meaning of saying that the

<p>districts already established for the petty sessions'

<p>courts shall be the districts for our courts? to su-

<p>persede the petty sessions' courts and the magis-

<p>system, are to be persons appointed, not by the par-

<p>case comes to be adjudicated on, a form is to be gone

<p>tion, before there isany difference at all. " For this
</p>
<p>purpose they would suggest, that the repeal wardens
</p>
<p>resident in the several districts, be called upon to
</p>
<p>recommend to the association"  not to the parties
</p>
<p>who are litigants, but to the association  " such
</p>
<p>persons as may seem to them best qualified to act as
</p>
<p>arbitrators, and that they be directed, in making
</p>
<p>their selection, to require the aid of the repeal
</p>
<p>clergy and gentry in their several districts." They
</p>
<p>recommend that any person who has a matter in
</p>
<p>controversy, shall serve a notice on his adversary,
</p>
<p>citing him before this new tribunal of arbitration,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of adjudicating on the matter in con-
</p>
<p>troversy between them. They then make further
</p>
<p>suggestions with which I need not trouble you, and
</p>
<p>they add, that the records of these tribunals are to
</p>
<p>be kept amongst the archives of the association.
</p>
<p>Their decisions, and the proceedings before them,
</p>
<p>are to be registered and recorded at the association.
</p>
<p>Well might Mr. Duffy say, in the paper which I
</p>
<p>read to you a while ago, that these parties were fast
</p>
<p>becoming a nation ; that " the administration of
</p>
<p>justice" was already in their hands. When this was
</p>
<p>stated in the course of the trial, it was alleged that
</p>
<p>that part of the report had not been acceded to or
</p>
<p>adopted. I shall show you, in a few minutes, that

</p>
<p>not merely an unjust and iniquitous, but an illesal
</p>
<p>and invalid act. Saurin, amongst others, declared
</p>
<p>that resistance was a question of time and prudence,
</p>
<p>and would become a dutj' whenever strength and
</p>
<p>opportunity might concur in justifying the ed'ort for
</p>
<p>its abrogation. A greater than Saurin lias at
</p>
<p>length given fortli tlie irrevocable voice  resist-
</p>
<p>ance to the union has become a duty." Now
</p>
<p>this was two days after the prorogation of par-
</p>
<p>liament. " Resistance to the union has become
</p>
<p>a duty." Does that mean resistance by petitioning,
</p>
<p>after months have been suffered to elapse without a
</p>
<p>petition, and afterparliamenth.ad separated? "This,
</p>
<p>the forty-third year of provincial degradation, may,
</p>
<p>if the people have wortli and energy, become the
</p>
<p>first of restored independence." Has any explana-
</p>
<p>tion been given by Mr. Duffy of the meaning of
</p>
<p>" resistance to the union," or making the year 1843
</p>
<p>the year of restored independence, the parliament
</p>
<p>through wliosemstrumentality that could be effected
</p>
<p>having separated ? The people were not disposed
</p>
<p>to be troublesome or to be riotous, a\id are not
</p>
<p>riotous. The people were not disposed to join in
</p>
<p>anything like a public demonstration or movement.
</p>
<p>They laboured under what tliis writer calls " apathy
</p>
<p>to the high and holy impulses of nationality." They
</p>
<p>were quiet, " when cicatrization seemed superin-
</p>
<p>duced by Whig palliatives, and the wound inflicted
</p>
<p>on our Irish pride and honour no longer gaped and
</p>
<p>bled." That is to say, certain measures were intro-
</p>
<p>duced by tlie members of that administration for
</p>
<p>the redress of the supposed grievances of Ireland,
</p>
<p>what he calls, " Whig palliatives," and as long as
</p>
<p>that was the case the people were quiet, and were

<p>disposed to be quiet  "but O'Connell tore asunder
</p>
<p>the bandages, and revealed to Ireland the e.xact seat
</p>
<p>and true character of her social and political di-
</p>
<p>sease." That is to say, he was the person who had
</p>
<p>created this agitation, torn off the bandages, as it is
</p>
<p>expressed, and induced the people to rouse tlicm-
</p>
<p>selves from that apathy into wliich tliey had fallen,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the Whig palliatives resorted to
</p>
<p>by the administration of the day. Gentlemen, in
</p>
<p>the e.irly part of my address to you, I stated that 1
</p>
<p>did not attach any value whatever to what was said
</p>
<p>or done in the repeal association during the years
</p>
<p>1841 or 1842. We are prosecuting here the j)ro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of the year 1843, each of them in the man-
</p>
<p>ner I have detailed to you, leading to the gradual
</p>
<p>usurpation of all the functions of the state. Having
</p>
<p>now detailed all tlie apathy into which the country
</p>
<p>sank from " Whig palliatives," the writer goes on 
</p>
<p>" The million-shout of Tara completed the proof,
</p>
<p>and flung back the responsibility again upon the
</p>
<p>leaders." The people had so far answered the call,
</p>
<p>that they had done their duty. "Yes! the people
</p>
<p>had sufBciently shown their willingness and worthi-
</p>
<p>ness to be led, by a thousand proofs of devotion to
</p>
<p>the cause of fideUty to their leaders. Whither and
</p>
<p>when? began to beiisked.ere the echoes of Tara had
</p>
<p>died upon the public ear." Led when and led whi-
</p>
<p>ther? Gentleuien, there is no ambiguity in that.
</p>
<p>" Thepeople called upon their leaders." " You have
</p>
<p>stated to us that we ought to be ready. We are
</p>
<p>ready. When do you want us? Whither are we to
</p>
<p>go ? We fling tlie responsibility back on you ;
</p>
<p>answer us now our question." " The leaders have
</p>
<p>answered, and the responsibility is again on the

</p>
<p>case they were bound to disobey. The reason for
</p>
<p>this interference is not assigned ; and when he says
</p>
<p>he does " not mean to make any practical applica-
</p>
<p>tion of the doctrine to this or any otlier country,"
</p>
<p>it will be for you to say what other intention he
</p>
<p>could have have had. I am merely using this as
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett's act ; we have no right to do other-
</p>
<p>wise, as it was published only in his paper. He
</p>
<p>says:  " 1 put it forward solely as an adjunct to
</p>
<p>Mr. O'ConneU's general theory of peaceful agitation,
</p>
<p>which would bring about every amelioration in the
</p>
<p>condition of mankind, by instructing every class of
</p>
<p>the community in the moral duties they owe to each
</p>
<p>other." That is the reason he assigns for instruct-
</p>
<p>ing the soldiery in their duties. Now, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I think you will liave no doubt, on comparing this
</p>
<p>document of the 28111 of August, in the Fihi, with
</p>
<p>the document of tlie lUth of June, in the Nalion,
</p>
<p>that the two i^ublishers had the same common
</p>
<p>design, and that that common design was in accord-
</p>
<p>ance with the plan of Mr. O'Connell, and those
</p>
<p>associated with him, naraelj', to introduce into the
</p>
<p>army a spirit of  I will call it no more than  re-
</p>
<p>luctance to interfere and do their duty, should any
</p>
<p>emergency arise to render it necessary to call on
</p>
<p>them to discharge their duty to their officers. This
</p>
<p>is instructing them how to guide themselves in such
</p>
<p>an event, if they were to follow the doctrines
</p>
<p>these papers inculcate, they would ask themselves
</p>
<p>" is tliis a just war  is this an occasion on which I
</p>
<p>should obey my superior ofScer ?" And, recollect,
</p>
<p>this is in a publication avowed to he an adjunct to
</p>
<p>Mr. U'Connell's scheme, and to the following it out.

</p>
<p>August, the day following this publication, to
</p>
<p>which it will be necessary to request your particu-
</p>
<p>lar attention. You will recollect, gentlemen, Mr.
</p>
<p>Jackson deposed to his having been present at the
</p>
<p>association on the 29tli of August, when Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell, Mr. Ray, and Mr. John O'Connell were
</p>
<p>present; and Mr. Jackson, who did not take short-
</p>
<p>hand notes, but only gave you a summary of what
</p>
<p>took place from the materials which he had col-
</p>
<p>lected, states that Mr. O'Connell alluded to 1829,
</p>
<p>that is the period of the emancipation act, and the
</p>
<p>year 184.3 ; and he said that twenty-si.K years of
</p>
<p>despotism had passed  that he denounced the Whigs
</p>
<p>as " base, brutal, and bloody"  that the magisterial
</p>
<p>bench had been cleared of every friend of Ireland
</p>
<p>that the people were so discontented, and the coun-
</p>
<p>try so dissatisfied, that if the union were not now
</p>
<p>dissolved there would be a sanguinary civil war.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, said he, " not in my time, for I will leave
</p>
<p>it as a legacy to those who come after me"  and he
</p>
<p>added, 'it might not be an unadvisable result." It
</p>
<p>has been broadly asserted that that language was
</p>
<p>not used, and that Mr. Jackson was either mis-
</p>
<p>taken, or wilfully misrepresenting, when he charged
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell with having used those expressions.
</p>
<p>But I have to recal to your recoUectio.i, that the
</p>
<p>proceedings of this 29th of August are not resting on
</p>
<p>the testimony of Mr. Jackson alone, because Mr.
</p>
<p>Eoss, the short-hand writer, was also at this meet
</p>
<p>ing, as well as Mr. Jackson ; and Mr. Ross read his
</p>
<p>note to the jury, a copy of which I have ; and I
</p>
<p>beg leave to direct the attention of the jury to
</p>
<p>some passages in the speech of Mr. O'Connell,
</p>
<p>as taken in short-hand by that gentleman. He

</p>
<p>finble means to be used against the perpetuity of
</p>
<p>the unicm." And then he goes on:  "In despair
</p>
<p>of carrying repeal." Gentlemen, I think tliat is
</p>
<p>a tolerably good exposition by Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>himself, of his conception of the actual state of
</p>
<p>the people of this country, in consequence of his
</p>
<p>organisation, when he delivered that speech on the
</p>
<p>2dtli of August last. Well, gentlemen, we come
</p>
<p>now to a meeting of the 4th of September, at the
</p>
<p>association, deposed to by Mr. Jackson, at which
</p>
<p>Mr. Ray, Mr. O'Connell, Mr. Steele, and Mr. John
</p>
<p>O'Connell were present. Mr. Kay, as Mr. .lackson
</p>
<p>swears, on that occasion recommended  " That the
</p>
<p>vendors of ballads should circulate ' the. Spirit of the
</p>
<p>Nation,' and abandon the trash they had spread
</p>
<p>among the people." The speech delivered by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell on that occasion was taken by Mr. Koss,
</p>
<p>and I must call your attention to some passages in
</p>
<p>that speech, as appearing from his notes:  " I want
</p>
<p>no revolution ; or if any, only a return to former
</p>
<p>times; such a revolution as I7S2 or 1829  a blood-
</p>
<p>less, stainless revolution  a political change for the
</p>
<p>belter." Now mark what follows :  " But who can
</p>
<p>tell me that we have not sufficient resources remain-
</p>
<p>ing, even if our present plans should be defeated ?"
</p>
<p>Hear what the resources are: "The people of
</p>
<p>Ireland might increase the potato culture, and leave
</p>
<p>the entire harvest of Ireland uncut." A suggestion
</p>
<p>of that kind needs no commentary from me. " What
</p>
<p>would be the remedy for that? Who will tell me
</p>
<p>that the repealers of every class might not totally
</p>
<p>give up the consumption of ccciseable articles':'"
</p>
<p>You see how the resources are gradually developed 
</p>
<p>" I throw out these things merely to show that if

<p>the diabolical attempt to create bloodshed should
</p>
<p>succeed"  that is to say, should the military be
</p>
<p>successful, and should blood be shed, should that
</p>
<p>attempt be successful"  "still the people would
</p>
<p>not be deprived of their resources, and the means
</p>
<p>of vindicating their cause. But of course I do not
</p>
<p>suggest them. I now come to our present position.
</p>
<p>We have at present in preparation two separate and
</p>
<p>distinct plans. The first is, to arrange the consti-
</p>
<p>tuency in such a manner, that if the Queen be
</p>
<p>pleased in six weeks to issue writs calling a new
</p>
<p>parliament in Ireland, she might be able at once to
</p>
<p>direct them to the proper constituencies. The
</p>
<p>scheme of the Irish parliament will very soon be
</p>
<p>circulated in print. 1 have received several com-
</p>
<p>munications on the subject, some excessively siWy.
</p>
<p>For e.xample, one person discovers that my plan of
</p>
<p>representation is not in arithmetical proportion.
</p>
<p>He is an arithmetical blockhead. 1 do not pretend
</p>
<p>to arithmetical equality. I tiike the reform bill as
</p>
<p>the basis in round numbers. The association would
</p>
<p>be ready to consider any cases in which it could be
</p>
<p>shown that wrong had been done. Mallow is a
</p>
<p>case in which there is a mistake. It is put down
</p>
<p>for one member ; my own opinion is that jMallow
</p>
<p>should get two members, and one should be taken
</p>
<p>from Cork. There are eleven members for Cork,
</p>
<p>with a rural population of seven hundred and eighty
</p>
<p>thousand  nearly as great as that of Wales, which
</p>
<p>returns twenty-eight members. I wish to work out
</p>
<p>this plan in all its details, before I form the council
</p>
<p>of three hundred. What I am now doing, and the
</p>
<p>preservative society, are totally separate, distinct,
</p>
<p>and unconnected  and though one will follow the
</p>
<p>43G
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>would not act against them. See how clearly this
</p>
<p>is demonstrated by the document to which I am
</p>
<p>about to direct your attention. This publication
</p>
<p>appears in the Pitnf, of tiie-fitli of September; it is
</p>
<p>entitled " Tlie Irisli in the English Arm}'." In this
</p>
<p>Tve have asuin explained the meaning of " Tlie jNIo-
</p>
<p>rality of War," and " TheDuty of a Soldier." This
</p>
<p>publication has not been commented on, or alluded
</p>
<p>to, by any of the counsel on the other side. It has,
</p>
<p>like the rest, been passed over in total silence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  Do not say that ; do not say
</p>
<p>" The Morality of War" was passed over.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  I say this article was passed
</p>
<p>over in total silence: "The Irish in the English
</p>
<p>Army  Mr. O'Callaghan's Letters." You will re-
</p>
<p>collect, gentlemen, in the early p.art of my statement
</p>
<p>I cilled your attention to a letter by ]\Ir. O'Cal-
</p>
<p>laghan, explanatory of the devices on the members'
</p>
<p>card. " He silenced the SiunUaid, by an.alysing the
</p>
<p>army, and showing that above forty-one thousand
</p>
<p>Paddies served in tliat force." These forty-one
</p>
<p>thousand I'addies in the army, are those whom Mr.
</p>
<p>Power, Mr. B.arrett, and Mr. Duffy, have thought it
</p>
<p>their duty to instruct in their military duties. Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the jury, there is no name signed to this
</p>
<p>article. It does not purport to be a letter of a cor-
</p>
<p>respondent ; it purports to be an original article in
</p>
<p>the newspaper. 1 think, gentlemen, after that I
</p>
<p>need not trouble you any further on that part of this
</p>
<p>case, which relates to the object of either seducing
</p>
<p>the army, or inducing the people of the country to
</p>
<p>believe, tliat the Irish soldiers, consislingof forty-one
</p>
<p>thousand in number, would iwvev act against them.

<p>Mr. O'Connell announced his intention of attending
</p>
<p>at Loughrea, which he did accordingly on the 10th
</p>
<p>of September. Mr. Ross has given us a part of his
</p>
<p>speech, in which he says, alluding to the Queen's
</p>
<p>speech  " They had but one arrow in the quiver 
</p>
<p>but one stone unflung  but one trick untried, and
</p>
<p>out they brought the Queen. All Europe was to be
</p>
<p>astonished by the splendour of her speech against
</p>
<p>Ireland  oh ! what a trick it was ! It was worse
</p>
<p>than a scolding match between two fisherwonien in
</p>
<p>Billingsgate. The fislicnvoman gives her colleague
</p>
<p>the power of reply ; and if she calls licr by ugly
</p>
<p>names, she is obliged to wait to hear them re-
</p>
<p>torted ; but the government had .ill the scolding on
</p>
<p>one side. It was an unfair advantage that Judy
</p>
<p>took of us." I suppose by th.at was meant the go-
</p>
<p>vernment. I believe Mr. O'Connell was right in say-
</p>
<p>ing it did not apply to the Queen. I do not mean to
</p>
<p>say of him that lie personally imputed anything to
</p>
<p>the Queen. " When they talked of beating us, we
</p>
<p>were ready with our shillelaghs. If they will give
</p>
<p>us fair play here at scolding, I am ready for them.
</p>
<p>I remember one phrase of that villain, Castlereagh,
</p>
<p>he talked of a man having his threat cut behind hi;
</p>
<p>back. That is what the ministers have done in tlie
</p>
<p>scolding match. Instead of giving me fair play, and
</p>
<p>hearing me in reply, thej' have cut my throat behind
</p>
<p>my back. Who is afraid of the Queen's speech ?
</p>
<p>(' No one.') No  but we have cause to rejoice in it.
</p>
<p>Our enemies would not use such a rotten weapon if
</p>
<p>they had better. IIow many hundred thousands did
</p>
<p>I see to-day to contradict their expectations ? The
</p>
<p>meeting of to-day was one of the most m.agnificent

</p>
<p>people, who wi'.i never a^^ain trust the English, be-
</p>
<p>cause they nei-er confided in them but they were

</p>
<p>Even the pretext of pursuing the repeal of the union
</p>
<p>in a legal and constitutional way, through the me-
</p>
<p>dium of parliament, is abandoned. We have here a

<p>distinct announcement to the world, that this is no

<p>longer the object, and that nothing but independence

<p>will suffice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton What were you reading

<p>from?
</p>
<p>The Solicitor- General From Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speech, from Mr. Koss's notes on the 13th of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember. Gentlemen, this document is headed " Loyal
</p>
<p>national repeal association. To the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>the countries subject to the British crown." Here is
</p>
<p>the go-by given to parliament altogether; here is
</p>
<p>an address to all the subjects of her Majesty  of the
</p>
<p>British crown  all over the world. "Fellow-sub-
</p>
<p>jects  The people of Ireland would anxiously desire
</p>
<p>your sympathy and support. But long and painful
</p>
<p>experience has taught them not to expect cither the
</p>
<p>one nor the other. There is no truth more unde-
</p>
<p>niable than this, that England h.as inflicted more
</p>
<p>grievous calamities upon Ireland than any country
</p>
<p>on the face of the earth besides has done upon any
</p>
<p>other." Attend to what follows  " In the history
</p>
<p>of mankind there is nothing to be compared with
</p>
<p>the atrocity of the crimes which England has perpe-

</p>
<p>which created and animated such crimes been much

<p>lence." Then follows a long detail of what you have
</p>
<p>repeatedly heard, during this trial, of those griev-
</p>
<p>ances about the representation, about the union,
</p>
<p>about absenteeism, and other such matters ; and
</p>
<p>then, gentlemen, there is this jiassage to which I
</p>
<p>must particularly refer  " Eighthly  Deep-rooted
</p>
<p>and increasing discontent pervades the entire nation.
</p>
<p>Feelings of estrangement are rapidly supplanting
</p>
<p>those affections which kindness and justice could
</p>
<p>have placed at the command of govennnent. De-
</p>
<p>spairing of redress from the legislature, the people of
</p>
<p>Ireland, confining themselves to legal and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional means, now rely upon their own strength and
</p>
<p>resolution for the attainment of those rights which
</p>
<p>they have sought from theBritish parliament in vain.
</p>
<p>They know full well that they can obtain adequate
</p>
<p>redress from a domestic legislature alone. Kinthly

<p>of the English government the guilt of having pro-

<p>duced this exasperation of national feeling." There
</p>
<p>is a black catalogue of grievances against England,
</p>
<p>and then there is a distinct announcement that they
</p>
<p>mean to rely on themselves for the accomplishment
</p>
<p>of the object. " Fellow-subjects ! our case is before
</p>
<p>you and before the world. Grievances, such as the
</p>
<p>Irish people endure, no other country has ever suf-
</p>
<p>fered. Insults, such as are oflered to us, were never
</p>
<p>inflicted on any other. There is one consolation : it
</p>
<p>is admitted by all, and is as clear as the noon-day
</p>
<p>sun, that unless we redress ourselves, we can have
</p>
<p>no succour from any other quarter ; but we suffice
</p>
<p>for ourselves aud our country  we suffice for the

<p>repeal. We expect nothing from England or Eng-

</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS,
</p>
<p>mation was to be acfiieved. The three hundred
</p>
<p>gentlemen, who, perhaps, but that these proceedings
</p>
<p>had been arrested or stopped, might have been now
</p>
<p>assembled, were to enter into negotiations with the
</p>
<p>British minister, and transmit to him anintiniaiion,
</p>
<p>that if he did not at once accede to tlie demands of
</p>
<p>the loyal national repeal association, by repealing
</p>
<p>the union, the harvest would be suffered to rot on
</p>
<p>the ground, the state should be paralysed, the phy-
</p>
<p>sical power of the country called out, and if any
</p>
<p>attempt was made to put them down, tliey would
</p>
<p>use that physical force for the purpose of resisting
</p>
<p>any such attempt. " It is avowed that proud Eng-
</p>
<p>land dare not assume an attitude of menace towards
</p>
<p>any state in the world, however insignificant 
</p>
<p>(cheers). The English government can no longer
</p>
<p>threaten. Alas! it cannot exert itself in necessiu-y
</p>
<p>defence. It is weak, because it has vithered the
</p>
<p>strong arm of Irish affection. Yon saw how the
</p>
<p>cavalry fell in and took their station, five by five, at
</p>
<p>the word of command of Tom Steele. No aide-
</p>
<p>de-camp of the lord lieutenant was ever obeyed so
</p>
<p>cheerfully as he was." Gentlemen, I think that is
</p>
<p>tolerably significant of an appeal to physical force 
</p>
<p>BufSciently free from ambiguity or difficulty in its
</p>
<p>meaning. The ne.\t meeting that took place, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, was at Mullaghmast, which was a verj' im-
</p>
<p>portant one. In the interval, between the meeting
</p>
<p>of Clifden, the importance of which I have not
</p>
<p>overrated, and that at Mullaghmast, there ap-
</p>
<p>peared a publication in the Pilot of the 25th of
</p>
<p>September. The question at issue between us and
</p>
<p>the traversers, you will recollect, is this : they say,
</p>
<p>they never meant to do anything but to make a

<p>demonstration of moral force, and national will.
</p>
<p>" No," say we, " you did mean to make a de-
</p>
<p>monstration of physical force." Have I, so far as
</p>
<p>I have gone, supported our allegation, and nega-
</p>
<p>tived theirs? Just at the time that the avowal is
</p>
<p>made by Mr. O'Connell at Clifden, of the military
</p>
<p>organization of the people, appears the publication,
</p>
<p>to which I have alluded, in the Pilol, called " The
</p>
<p>Army, the I'eople. and the Government." It is
</p>
<p>published on the 23th of September, 1643, in lUr.
</p>
<p>Barrett's paper. After stating that the army is
</p>
<p>the people's army, because they are paid by the
</p>
<p>people, and because their ranks are supplied from
</p>
<p>the people, the article goes on  " A system pre-
</p>
<p>cisely similar to this"  that is, the present system
</p>
<p>of promotion in the army  "prevailed in Erance,
</p>
<p>previous to what is calkd the revolution  that is, a
</p>
<p>change by which the people were enabled to divide
</p>
<p>the land amongst each other like brothers." That
</p>
<p>is Mr. Barrett's definition of a revolution. Well,
</p>
<p>geqtlemen, he then says^-" Trior to the French
</p>
<p>revolution, no man, however brave or well-con-
</p>
<p>ducted, could procure any rank above the hopeless
</p>
<p>position of a private or sergeant-^except he be-
</p>
<p>longed to the droni-h and unproductive classes,
</p>
<p>calling themselves nobles. How long this stale of
</p>
<p>things is likely to continue in these countries we do
</p>
<p>not know." The allusion to these sergeants being
</p>
<p>promoted to be commissioned officers, was made at
</p>
<p>former meetings. "The Liberator has said, 'he
</p>
<p>who commits a crime gives strength to the enemy ;'
</p>
<p>and, we believe, it is quite sufficient reason for the
</p>
<p>Irish not to commit a crime, when we tell them that
</p>
<p>enemy is England." That is the secret motive of

</p>
<p>the proceedings began; to imbue tlicm ivitli n pro-
</p>
<p>per spirit when they assembled at the place, which
</p>
<p>was the scene of this horrible massacre. Tliis was
</p>
<p>sold by thousands. "We allude to these p.nrticulars
</p>
<p>about the dates, because Corry and others have
</p>
<p>fallen into the same error with regard to it as Leland.
</p>
<p>and because we are anxious to show Irishmen of
</p>
<p>every class that the antipathy exhibited by England
</p>
<p>to Ireland is more a national than a religious one 
</p>
<p>fully as much treachery, fully as much cruelty,
</p>
<p>fully as much barbarity having been practised by
</p>
<p>Catholic England, iu proportion to her ability,
</p>
<p>towards Catholic Ireland, as there has in subsequent
</p>
<p>years been perpetrated by Protestant England.
</p>
<p>Teutoncs and Celts, the races of the two countries,
</p>
<p>are different ; like acids, they will not amalgamate,
</p>
<p>nor cannot meet without one neutralising the other.
</p>
<p>For this reason, as well as numberless others, it is
</p>
<p>necessary that the parliament of the two countries
</p>
<p>should be separate, and the inhabitants of each be
</p>
<p>brought as little into colUsion with the other as pos-
</p>
<p>sible." Does that mean, that if there were separate

<p>legislatures, all connection was to cease between the
</p>
<p>two countries? Or what docs it mean? What is
</p>
<p>the meaning of this language thus circulated ? Gen-

<p>tlemen, I am afraid I shall not be able to close to-

<p>day what I have to offer upon the proceedings at
</p>
<p>MuUaghmast. I have dwelt at much greater length
</p>
<p>on this part of the case than I had intended. But,
</p>
<p>although I have avoided anything like unuecessary
</p>
<p>repetition, I fear it will be impossible to conclude
</p>
<p>to-day what I have yet to say as to this meeting.
</p>
<p>I shall therefore respectfully request of the court an
</p>
<p>adjournment until the morning.

<p>THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL RESUMED.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, a person of the name of Healey was
</p>
<p>examined as a witness, and proved some particulars
</p>
<p>with respect to this meeting at MuUaghmast, to
</p>
<p>which I must invite your attention. His concep-
</p>
<p>tion as to the number is, that they were not short
</p>
<p>of one hundred thousand persons. He says "that
</p>
<p>he observed several inscriptions," and amongst
</p>
<p>others, he describes two : one " MuUaghmast and
</p>
<p>its martyrs  a voice from the grave." That inscrip-
</p>
<p>tion was also in the banquet room, where the dinner
</p>
<p>took place  as I understood the witness  imme-
</p>
<p>diately behind the chairman who presided. There
</p>
<p>was also an inscription 
</p>
<p>" No Saxon butchery shall give blood gouts for a
</p>
<p>repast;
</p>
<p>The dog is roused, arid treachery expelled from
</p>
<p>MuUaghmast."
</p>
<p>He then, gentlemen, describes some other particu-
</p>
<p>lars, in which this meeting corresponded with those
</p>
<p>which preceded it ; and with respect to which,
</p>
<p>therefore, I need not detain you. I shall proceed
</p>
<p>at once to the speeches, which you will recollect
</p>
<p>have been deposed to by Mr. Hughes. Gentlemen,

<p>THE mrSH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>jlistrates rit petty sessioiio, to p)it an end to tlie
</p>
<p>profanation of taking oaths  to diminish litigation
</p>
<p>.and ill-will  and all that? Is there not here a
</p>
<p>direct assumption, on the part of Mr. OTonuell, of
</p>
<p>the administration of the justice of the country?
</p>
<p>As much as to say  I am now about, for the first
</p>
<p>time, to appoint and establish a judicial system
</p>
<p>which will at length insure tlie administration of
</p>
<p>.real justice in Ireland. He then says  " Oh 1 my
</p>
<p>friends, listen to tlie man of peace, who will not
</p>
<p>e.fpose you to your enemies. In 1798 there were
</p>
<p>brave men at tlie head of the people at large ; there
</p>
<p>were some valiant men, but there were many traitors
</p>
<p>who left the people exposed to the swords of the
</p>
<p>enemy." Tlie enemy !  that is, of those who put
</p>
<p>that rebellion down. " On the Curragh of Kildare
</p>
<p>you confided your military power to your relations;
</p>
<p>they were basely betrayed and trampled under foot ;
</p>
<p>it was ill-organised ; a premature, a foolish, and an
</p>
<p>absurd insurrection." Such is the way in which
</p>
<p>this loyal subject speaks of the rebellion of 17i>8 
</p>
<p>that it was a "premature, foolish, and absurd insur-
</p>
<p>rection." " But you have a leader now, who will
</p>
<p>never allow you to be led astray." What is the
</p>
<p>meaning of "led astray?" This  j'our present
</p>
<p>leader will never allow you to break out too soon ;
</p>
<p>never allow 3'ou to frustrate that by premature im-
</p>
<p>patience, which can only be successful by a regular
</p>
<p>course of organisation and preparation. " Tlie
</p>
<p>Scotch iiliilosopher, and the French philosopher,
</p>
<p>has confirmed it, that number one in the liuniau
</p>
<p>race is, blessed be heaven ! the Irish. In moral
</p>
<p>virtue, in religious perseverance, in glorious tem-
</p>
<p>perance  have you any teetotallers there?  (cries

</p>
<p>of 'Yes.') Yes; it is teetotalism that is repealing
</p>
<p>the union. I could not afford to bring you together,
</p>
<p>I would not dare to do it, if I had not had teeto-
</p>
<p>tallers for my police." Is not this the strongest
</p>
<p>expression of Mr. O'Connell's own conviction of
</p>
<p>the natural tendency of these meetings, and of
</p>
<p>the difficulty of restraining them from actual vio-
</p>
<p>lence? Gentlemen, so much for Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speech .at the meeting itself. Tlicre was a dinner,
</p>
<p>or banquet, at this Hath of Mullaghniast, in a pa-
</p>
<p>vilion erected for the iiurpose. How the e-\--
</p>
<p>pense of these several things was defrayed, does not
</p>
<p>appear, hut you can probably draw some sort
</p>
<p>of inference. At the dinner, I find from Mr.
</p>
<p>Hughes's evidence, that there were present Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Counell, Mr. John O'Connell, Mr. Hay, Mr. Steele,
</p>
<p>Mr. Ban-ett, and Dr. Gray. Mr. John O'tlonnell
</p>
<p>presided at the dinner, and he introduced the toast
</p>
<p>of the Queen's health with these words :  "I do not,
</p>
<p>because I cannot anticipate that in any phase of cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances the toast I have now to give will be re-
</p>
<p>ceived otherwise than well by Irishmen  it is the
</p>
<p>health of the Queen. 'Whatever may happen, her
</p>
<p>throne in Ireland is secure. Her ministers may fi.x
</p>
<p>her throne amidst bloody fields, .ind blazing cities,
</p>
<p>and slaughtered corpses ; let them take care that the
</p>
<p>ruddiest stream flowing might not be their own
</p>
<p>blood, aud the brightest and fiercest flame might not
</p>
<p>be from the strongholds from which they now insult
</p>
<p>the Irish people." Meaning, 1 suppose, London.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that is the manner in which the loyal
</p>
<p>toast of the Queen's health was introduced by Mr.
</p>
<p>John O'Connell. Some letters were read, apologis-
</p>
<p>ing for the absence of cert.ain gentlemen from this
</p>
<p>THE SOLICITOll-GENERAL'S REPLY,
</p>
<p>441
</p>
<p>find that Br. Gray also addressed a speech to the
</p>
<p>people ;issembled at the dinner, from which I shall
</p>
<p>l)eg to extract a passage or two. He was called upon
</p>
<p>to return thanks for some toast, "The I'ress," or
</p>
<p>" The People ;" I am not certain which. He adverts
</p>
<p>to the case of the arbitrators, and he says : "He is
</p>
<p>proud to stand up to return thanks, not on behalf of
</p>
<p>tliis class, or of that class, but on behalf of the
</p>
<p>judges appointed by the people  for the first time
</p>
<p>the people's judges." Now is this calculated to
</p>
<p>bring the .administration of justice into contempt or
</p>
<p>not? What is the meaning of it? " Our enemies
</p>
<p>say, the judges appointed by the people will be
</p>
<p>powerless. I tell you they will not be powerless;
</p>
<p>their powers are far more e.Ktensive than the powers
</p>
<p>my Lord Chancellor Sugden can confer; nay, more,
</p>
<p>their powers are more extensive than those pos-
</p>
<p>sessed by the chairman, or by an assistant barrister ;
</p>
<p>the repeal arbitrators appointed by the people can
</p>
<p>go to any extent. Magistrates are confined to a
</p>
<p>very few pounds in civil cases. The cliairman of a
</p>
<p>county is confined to 20/. in civil cases, all they can
</p>
<p>adjudicate upon is 20/. ; and tlie repeal arbitrators,
</p>
<p>appointed by the people, can adjudicate iu cases of
</p>
<p>20/. without costing the suitor one single penny."
</p>
<p>Then he says, they have a criminal jurisdiction, if
</p>
<p>criminals could be found. Gentlemen, so terminate
</p>
<p>the proceedings at MuUaghmast, upon the 1st of
</p>
<p>October ; and I must say, they appear to me to be
</p>
<p>sufficiently cliaracteristic of the objects of the par-
</p>
<p>ties engaged. Remember that Mr. O'Connell, at
</p>
<p>one of tlie meetings which I detailed yesterday, an-
</p>
<p>nounced that in pursuance of the new plan which
</p>
<p>had been adopted, of calling together large masses

</p>
<p>of persons, at particular spots, calculated to keep
</p>
<p>up in their minds afeeling of ill-will, which he, and
</p>
<p>those concerned with him, were an.xious to perpetu-
</p>
<p>ate, tliere was to be a meeting at Clontarf, upon the
</p>
<p>8th of October. On tlie 30th of Septemlier, there
</p>
<p>appeared in the Nation newspaper, tlie connection of
</p>
<p>which with this association you already know, an
</p>
<p>announcement or a progranmic, if I may so express
</p>
<p>myself, of the manner in which the persons going
</p>
<p>to that meeting were to be arrayed. You will re-
</p>
<p>member that at Clifden, and at other later meet-
</p>
<p>ings, the undisguised phi-ases used are " military or-
</p>
<p>ganisation," "cavalry and infantry," and soon.
</p>
<p>On this day there appeared the advertisement;- 
</p>
<p>"Repeal Cavalry  Clontarf Jleeting." Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the announcement in one of the public newspapers
</p>
<p>of such a formid.ible demonstration, excited, or was
</p>
<p>calculated to excite, ronsiderable apprehension. You
</p>
<p>will have no doubt by and by, wlien I read a pas-
</p>
<p>sage or two from the speech of Mr. O'Connell, that
</p>
<p>the announcement to which I have adverted, was
</p>
<p>the production of the committee, who had been con-
</p>
<p>sidering the mode in which this military demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion should be made. Either from the existence of
</p>
<p>such an appreliension, as I have mentioned, or from
</p>
<p>some other cause, which I do not pretend to know,
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell, between the Saturday when that ad-
</p>
<p>vertisement appeared, and the next day of meeting
</p>
<p>of the association, began to reflect that lie was going
</p>
<p>a little too far ; that it was not, at the present mo-
</p>
<p>ment, quite prudent to hold up, in such very undis-
</p>
<p>guised terms, the object of this meeting. He found
</p>
<p>he had been travelling a little too fast ; and that the
</p>
<p>caution which lie had so strongly recommended to

</p>
<p>feeling of merriment amongst my brethren at the
</p>
<p>bar, but you can guess how it was understood bj' the
</p>
<p>people to whom it was addressed."" Suffice it to say,
</p>
<p>however, that it sliows abundantly an intention to
</p>
<p>overturn and subvert the regular tribunals of the
</p>
<p>country, and substitute in llieir room the arbitration
</p>
<p>courts. Then comes the speech of the Reverend
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney was present at a meet-
</p>
<p>ing on the 15th of August, at Clontibret, the same
</p>
<p>day on which the Tara demonstration took place.
</p>
<p>You will recollect the conversation deposed to by
</p>
<p>M'Cann, the police officer, which is now undisputed.
</p>
<p>He has sworn it, and there is no kind of answer or
</p>
<p>denial. His character was assailed most unwar-
</p>
<p>rantably, but I think I have sufficiently vindicated
</p>
<p>it yesterday. We find Mr. Tierney then, at the as-
</p>
<p>sociation on the 3d of October, using this language ;
</p>
<p>he adverts to the progress of repeal, and he asks 
</p>
<p>" Wherefore do the people who surround Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell wherever he goes, numberless as the w.i . es uf
</p>
<p>the ocean, assemble ? You come here to enable him
</p>
<p>to make your own Ireland  the land of your birth 
</p>
<p>the land of the happy and the free. And let me
</p>
<p>ask you, are you all prepared to do so ? (cries of
</p>
<p>'Yes, yes.') If you are, give him deeds as well as
</p>
<p>words. I can answer for the county I have the
</p>
<p>honour to belong to, Monaghan ; and for the parish
</p>
<p>that I have also the honour to be the priest of, that
</p>
<p>there we are determined to give our hands as well as
</p>
<p>our hearts." He then, gentlemen, proceeds to give
</p>
<p>an account of Hugh, Earl of Tyrone, and a battle in
</p>
<p>which he was concerned, which he calls one of the
</p>
<p>"bright spots" in the history of Ireland; and he
</p>
<p>says  ."In the name of the county I am from, and

</p>
<p>particularly of my own parish, Clontibret, where a
</p>
<p>hundred tiglits were fought, permit me to hand you,
</p>
<p>in the name of that parish, in the name of that
</p>
<p>people, the children of the men that fought the bat-
</p>
<p>tle of victory, unassisted from any other locality,
</p>
<p>but being of the north, and of that country alone 
</p>
<p>permit me in their names, and in my own, to have
</p>
<p>the honour of handing to you ninety-two pounds."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, I am far from saying that
</p>
<p>we should have been warranted in including in this
</p>
<p>indictment any person who merely attended a meet-
</p>
<p>ing, or two or three meetings, called together by the
</p>
<p>people whom we are indicting ; far from it. It is
</p>
<p>really a gross perversion to attribute to us any such
</p>
<p>intention ; we are not prosecuting the people that
</p>
<p>attended the meetings. Some might have attended
</p>
<p>from mere curiosity, some from very innocent mo-
</p>
<p>tives; we are not prosecuting merely for any such
</p>
<p>conduct. The persons indicted are those who called
</p>
<p>these meetings together for illegal purposes. Mr.
</p>
<p>Tierney 's attending the meeting at Clontibret, or at
</p>
<p>Dublin, would not perhaps of itself have justified
</p>
<p>us in including him in this indictment. But, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, when in .addition to his appearing at Clonti-
</p>
<p>bret, we found this language used by him, in which
</p>
<p>he himself answers for the state of things in his own
</p>
<p>parish, and in his own county of Monaghan, and
</p>
<p>that Ihey were there determined to give Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell " their hands as well as their hearts," we thought
</p>
<p>it incumbent upon us to include Mr. Tierney, as a
</p>
<p>party in this confederacy. We thought these facts
</p>
<p>furnished abundant evidence to prove, that in the
</p>
<p>views of these parties who promoted the meetings
</p>
<p>originally, this gentleman fully participated. It is

</p>
<p>terruption of that meeting. Gentlemen, if that in-
</p>
<p>terposition on the part of the executive had not
</p>
<p>taken place, what rlo you suppose might have been
</p>
<p>the position of things at present? You will recol-
</p>
<p>lect, that Mr. O'Connell, at the meetings that had
</p>
<p>taken place shortly before that time, had announced
</p>
<p>his intention of having assembled, either at the end
</p>
<p>of the last, or the beginning of the present year,
</p>
<p>three hundred persons, each with a certain sum of
</p>
<p>money  in the character, in fact, of legislators, or
</p>
<p>at all events, of negotiators with the British par-
</p>
<p>liament. They were to hold their sittings here.
</p>
<p>This he would do in spite of the convention act, or
</p>
<p>any other act. In short, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>this would have been, as far as one can at present
</p>
<p>judge, a sort of consummation of the plans he then
</p>
<p>had in contemplation ; it would have added legisla-
</p>
<p>tion to all the other functions, which had been
</p>
<p>usurped by himself, or by his associates. However,
</p>
<p>the stopping of the Clontarf meeting ai)pears to have
</p>
<p>arrested the progress of these proceedings. How
</p>
<p>they might otherwise have teiniiuated  how far
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell might have involved himself how
</p>
<p>far he might have been implicated in point of law,
</p>
<p>it is not for me now to say ; pei'li.aps it may be as
</p>
<p>well for him that it did not go so fur. Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the traversers' counsel read, as jiart of their case,
</p>
<p>certain passages from a "speech of Mr. O'Connell's,
</p>
<p>whicli was delivered by him at a meeting of the as-
</p>
<p>sociation on the 9th of Octolier, in Calvert's theatre.
</p>
<p>At that meeting, it appears, a certain person of the
</p>
<p>name of Hanley, of iManchester, was presented to
</p>
<p>the notice of the association, and he delivered an
</p>
<p>address from the repealers at Manchester, in answer

</p>
<p>to which Mr. O'Connell made some observations,
</p>
<p>which were thought to be material to his defence by
</p>
<p>his counsel, and were accordingly read. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, in that address, the Manchester repeal body
</p>
<p>pay a very high comphment to the exertions of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell in the cause of repeal. Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, that address from the Manchester re-
</p>
<p>pealers appears to have been agreed to, before the
</p>
<p>intimation had arrived that the meetings were
</p>
<p>stopped. On the 7th of October, the proclama-
</p>
<p>tion issued immediately before the meeting at Clon-
</p>
<p>tarf, and the issuing of that proclamation announced
</p>
<p>to Mr. O'Connell the determination of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment that these proceedings should not take place.
</p>
<p>Then was issue joined with Mr. O'Connell upon
</p>
<p>the grand question as to the legality of the meet-
</p>
<p>ings that had taken place, and of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings to which he and the other traversers had been
</p>
<p>privy. Month after month, meeting after meeting,
</p>
<p>he liad been telling the people assembled about him,
</p>
<p>that he would carry them safely through, that they
</p>
<p>were violating no law, that he would defy the At-
</p>
<p>torney-General, that he dared the government to
</p>
<p>attack them; but when the attack (if I may so call
</p>
<p>it) is made, when it is announced, by that procla-
</p>
<p>mation, that it is the intention of government not to
</p>
<p>sufi'er this to go on, observe the way in which he
</p>
<p>answers this address, which echoed the sentiments
</p>
<p>that he had previously expressed, in ascribing to the
</p>
<p>people of England the tyranny, oppression, and mis-
</p>
<p>government, which had always distinguished what
</p>
<p>is called " Sa.xon rule and despotism." Observe now
</p>
<p>the difference in the language of Mr. O'Connell,

<p>when the challenge that he tlirows out is thus ac-

<p>ty evidence upon the other side. But, pentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, did you ever meet with an instance, in the
</p>
<p>course of your experience as jurors, (if you have any
</p>
<p>snch experience,) in whieli a charge lias been left so
</p>
<p>utterly unanswered as the present, so far as relates
</p>
<p>to proof  so totally passed by ? What was the evi-
</p>
<p>dence adduced to rebut this immense mass, whicli I
</p>
<p>liave consumed nearly two days in recalling to your
</p>
<p>recollection? Mr. Conway of the Evening Post, wa^
</p>
<p>produced, to prove that in 1810 there was a meeting
</p>
<p>of the citizens of ])ublin, convened by the sheriffs,
</p>
<p>to petition for a repeal of the union. Mr. Conway
</p>
<p>was suffered to go down without any cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion on our part ; in truth he had nothing to prove
</p>
<p>in the case. Then, gentlemen, was called a most
</p>
<p>respectable member of the Society of Friends, Mr.
</p>
<p>Perry, who proved the rules of the Quakers' society,
</p>
<p>prohibiting the members of that body from going to
</p>
<p>law. But what relation or analogy is there hetween
</p>
<p>this practice of the Quakers, and the usurpation of
</p>
<p>the judicial futictions of this country, by the appoint-
</p>
<p>ment of judges by an irresponsible body, the loyal
</p>
<p>national repeal association of Ireland ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>there was then evidence given as to references to the
</p>
<p>Ouzel Galley. A gentleman was called for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of showing that disputes of merchants arc fre-
</p>
<p>quently referred to a society called the Ouzel Galley,
</p>
<p>and that the arbitrators receive certain fees. A per-
</p>
<p>Eon of the name of Morgan was then called, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of taking the sting out of that part of the
</p>
<p>evidence for the crown, which related, you will re-
</p>
<p>collect, to the arch at Tullamore; and certainly,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, I think that they would have been better
</p>
<p>without that witness than withliim. Gentlemen, they

</p>
<p>then read several resolutions and several speeches of
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell ; with regard to \vhich I have only
</p>
<p>this to observe. Did you take the dates of those
</p>
<p>several speeches? You will find that they go on,
</p>
<p>from the beginning of 1841 to about the end of 1842,
</p>
<p>or the commencement of 1843 ; and then, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>comes the tender point. Beyond that, it is not con-
</p>
<p>sidered safe to go. KecoUect that the new repeal
</p>
<p>card issued early in 1843  recollect those rules of
</p>
<p>repeal wardens in 1843 recollect the d.ates of the
</p>
<p>several documents, and of the several proceedings
</p>
<p>which took place in 1843 ; and you will at once see,
</p>
<p>that it was impossible to go with Mr. O'Connell's
</p>
<p>speeches, or to go with his acts, or the acts of any of
</p>
<p>these traversers, farther than the commencement of
</p>
<p>the year 1843.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I beg your pardon. I think it
</p>
<p>right to correct my learned friend. It would not be
</p>
<p>right in us to read over again what had been read
</p>
<p>by the crown in 1843. We read our own evidence.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General  Yes. It was your evi-
</p>
<p>dence in answer to ours. The jury heard all that.
</p>
<p>I am now upon the evidence given by you, in addi-
</p>
<p>tion to that read by you whilst our evidence was
</p>
<p>going on. In the progress of our proofs, the defen-
</p>
<p>dants read Mr. O'Connell's repeated addresses and
</p>
<p>exhortations not to violate the law. Let them have
</p>
<p>the full benefit of that. Gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>what further? Not a single petition is presented
</p>
<p>to the house of commons, or the other house of par-
</p>
<p>liament, from the commencement of last session to
</p>
<p>its close; not one. I say, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>that the absence of a single petition to parliament,
</p>
<p>during the whole of the last session, speaks trumpet-

<p>Pilot, the speeches of Mr. O'ConncU, the allusions
</p>
<p>to the military, the hopes and inducements held out
</p>
<p>to the serge.iiits, thut part of the plan was to tamper
</p>
<p>with, or to neutralise, the army  to have it under-
</p>
<p>stood by the people of this country, that if it should
</p>
<p>be necessary to resort to any military force to pre-
</p>
<p>serve the law, or to prevent outbreak, they might
</p>
<p>safely calculate upon the neutrality of their country-
</p>
<p>men,' if not their coming round to join their ranks.
</p>
<p>I think you will also iind, from the holding those
</p>
<p>multitudmous meetingsthat all tliis places beyond
</p>
<p>the shadow of doubt, the intention of these jjarties,
</p>
<p>that these meetings should present a display antl
</p>
<p>demonstration of pliysical force, which would have
</p>
<p>the effect of overawing all opposition to the carrying
</p>
<p>this measure, which Mr. U'ConneU had pledged
</p>
<p>himself, at all hazards, to his tliree millions of re-
</p>
<p>pealers, at a sliilling each, to carry per fas aut nefus.
</p>
<p>That is my construction of it. I will not say he
</p>
<p>originally contemplated it  but he was driven to
</p>
<p>make those exhibitions of physical force. I am
</p>
<p>willing to allow that he is not proved to have in-
</p>
<p>tended to bring his followers into the field. That
</p>
<p>would be high treason, and we are not indicting him
</p>
<p>for that offence. If, liowever, he did not mean that
</p>
<p>these people should actually turn out in open rebel-
</p>
<p>lion. It is, at least, perfectly plain that he did intend
</p>
<p>by the demonstration of those masses, to create an
</p>
<p>impression in England, and amongst the peaceable
</p>
<p>people of this country, that there was a force at
</p>
<p>hand, ready to be resorted to when the proper occa-
</p>
<p>sion should arrive, sufBciently great to overwhelm
</p>
<p>all opposition, and that if the government did not

<p>wisest course," to yield at once and give him this
</p>
<p>measure of repeal, so as to enable him to redeem his
</p>
<p>pledge to those persons who were associated with him,
</p>
<p>that force would be resorted to. Gentlemen, when
</p>
<p>you consider also the time when the selection of
</p>
<p>these arbitrators was determined upon ; when you
</p>
<p>recollect that the dismissal of the magistrates by my
</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor was the reason and the occasion
</p>
<p>why this was thought of; when you recollect that
</p>
<p>those arbitrators are appointed by the association ;
</p>
<p>when you recollect the forms of the proceedings
</p>
<p>which have been adopted  when you recollect tlie
</p>
<p>constitution of the courts ; when you recollect that
</p>
<p>the magistrates dismissed are the persons selected
</p>
<p>to adjudicate between the different classes of the
</p>
<p>people, who are connected witli the association ;
</p>
<p>when you consider all this, you can have no doubt
</p>
<p>whatever, in my opinion, that there was also a
</p>
<p>settled plan to disparage the regular tribunals of
</p>
<p>this country, and substitute in their place the tri-
</p>
<p>hunals ai^jointed by the association. Here are all
</p>
<p>the functions, not only of the legislature, not only
</p>
<p>of the bench, but also of the e.xcctitive, usurped and
</p>
<p>assumed by tins knot of persons. Gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, it must be a strange state of things in our
</p>
<p>law, if all that can be legal. Have you a doubt that
</p>
<p>all these functions have been usurped and exercised
</p>
<p>by the persons who are connected with tliis move-

<p>ment? Do you believe that Mr. O'Conuell is one?
</p>
<p>Do you believe that ilv. Steele has joined him?

<p>Do you think Mr. Dutly has joined ? Do you think
</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett has joined? Do you think Mr. Kay

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>when the Irish Tolunteers stood forth and made the
</p>
<p>celebrated dselaration which has been so often re-
</p>
<p>ferred to. Gentlemen, I arraign this as one of the
</p>
<p>many fallacies and deceptions, that have been syste-
</p>
<p>matically practised on the people of this country by
</p>
<p>the leaders of this association. The state of things
</p>
<p>now is not what it w.as in 1782 ; far otherwise : and
</p>
<p>no man knows tiiat better than Mr. O'Connell him-
</p>
<p>self. In 1782 what was the state of tilings ? An
</p>
<p>act of parliament was passed in England, ' in the
</p>
<p>reign of George the First, Ireland having then her
</p>
<p>own parliament, and thatEnglisli act of parliament
</p>
<p>enacted, that it was competent to the English legis-
</p>
<p>lature, in which the Irish people had no representa-
</p>
<p>tives  not a member  to make laws binding Ire-
</p>
<p>land. Accordingly from that period of the sixth of
</p>
<p>George the First, down to 1782, that statute was ac-
</p>
<p>quiesced in. It was contrary, no doubt, to consti-
</p>
<p>tutional principle ; to be sure it was. What is con-
</p>
<p>stitutional principle? That there ought not io be
</p>
<p>government without representation ; the people
</p>
<p>ought not to be governed by a body, in the selection
</p>
<p>of whom, or part of whom, they have not a voice.
</p>
<p>It was contrary to all principles of justice, that the
</p>
<p>Irish people should be liable to be legislated for by
</p>
<p>the English houses of parliament, -when they had
</p>
<p>not a right to return one member to the English
</p>
<p>house of commons, vrhich was thus to rule them.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in 1782, there was a demonstration and
</p>
<p>a declaration, which has been made the foundation
</p>
<p>of the observations here on this repeal card, "That
</p>
<p>no power on earth has, or ouglit to have, a right to
</p>
<p>bind the people of Ireland, except the king, lords,
</p>
<p>and commons of Ireland." In 1782 that was a

</p>
<p>constitutional and legal declaration, because there
</p>
<p>then existed a king, lords, and commons of Ireland.
</p>
<p>But to use that language in 1843, or 1844, when tlu-
</p>
<p>Irish people have voices in the English legislature,
</p>
<p>is absurd in reasoning and illegal in principle. It
</p>
<p>is contrary to every principle, legal or constitu-
</p>
<p>tional ; it is seditious to hold such a doctrine at this
</p>
<p>day. I say, to lay down that doctrine in 1843 is
</p>
<p>unconstitutional, illegal, and seditious. Gentlvmen
</p>
<p>of the jury, I thought it riglit to disabuse your
</p>
<p>minds from this notion, if any such impression h.ns
</p>
<p>been made, that the parties engaged in this move-
</p>
<p>ment arc doing no more than following the pre-
</p>
<p>cedent set by some of the greatest men that have
</p>
<p>adorned this country. You will see at once, the
</p>
<p>wide distinction between the two cases ; and I think
</p>
<p>you can have no doubt, that the great men, whose
</p>
<p>names have been thus, I may say, profaned, never
</p>
<p>would have sanctioned a movement of this kind.
</p>
<p>which is neither more nor less than persuading the
</p>
<p>people of this country, that they are governed by
</p>
<p>persons who have no right to legislate for them, by
</p>
<p>strangers, by foreigners, by Saxons, by people who,
</p>
<p>from their earliest times, have had no other object
</p>
<p>in view but the conquest of their country, and keep-
</p>
<p>ing them in subjugation. The distinguished men
</p>
<p>to whom I have alluded, would have been the last
</p>
<p>persons to countenance anything of such a nature
</p>
<p>as this agitation. Gentlemen of the jury, I have to
</p>
<p>thank you for the very great attention which you
</p>
<p>have paid to me in the course of this protr.octed
</p>
<p>case. There are many topics suggested by it, on
</p>
<p>which I might dilate ; but I have been reminded by
</p>
<p>the counsel ou the other side, and I fully accede to
</p>
<p>THE CHARGE OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.

<p>447
</p>
<p>dred persons had assembled in tlie month of January,
</p>
<p>or February, and had taken upon them tlie func-
</p>
<p>tions, either of representatives, or delegates, of the
</p>
<p>people, of different counties and places in Ireland,
</p>
<p>or erected themselves into a body for the purpose of
</p>
<p>opening what is called a negotiation with the British
</p>
<p>minister. AVliat " negotiation" means I do not un-
</p>
<p>derstand ; my learned friend, Mr. Shell, says, that
</p>
<p>the agitator must sometimes be a diplomatist, and
</p>
<p>that in order to get what is practicable, it is some-
</p>
<p>times a prudent thing to ask for what is unattain-
</p>
<p>able. This was Mr. Shell's language in a part of
</p>
<p>his speech ; whether " negotiation" means that or
</p>
<p>not, it is not for me to say ; but if it does mean, as
</p>
<p>it may mean, a threat and denunciation to the liri-
</p>
<p>tish minister, that things were now come to that
</p>
<p>pass, that he must not think .any longer of refusing
</p>
<p>the repeal of the union, then, gentlemen, the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was complete, which we charge to have pro-
</p>
<p>gressed to a certain extent  that conspiracy being to
</p>
<p>accomplish its object by intimidation. Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, I hope I have satisfied you, that in
</p>
<p>point of law, so far as the law is for you, there is a
</p>
<p>conspiracy in this case, in the legal signification of
</p>
<p>the word. Not a secret combination, to be proved
</p>
<p>by any person who has been a party to it  other-
</p>
<p>wise we must resort to common informers and spies ;
</p>
<p>but a community of purpose, and illegal purpose,
</p>
<p>which is enough to constitute the crime of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy in point of law. And that was the only mode,
</p>
<p>observe, of dealing with this case ; because, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, it would not have done to have convicted Mr.
</p>
<p>Duflfy of tlie publication of a libel, or Mr. Barrett
</p>
<p>of the publication of a libel, or even Mr. O'Connell

<p>for the uttering of a seditious speech. That would
</p>
<p>not have done ; the great question which we want to
</p>
<p>have tried is, the legality of these proceedings, and
</p>
<p>of l^his body. The only mode by which that could
</p>
<p>be done, is by bringing the leaders of it in one mass
</p>
<p>or focus, and by charging those leaders with having
</p>
<p>violated the law. That is the meaning of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy ; that is tlie mode we have manfully and boldly
</p>
<p>adopted. We have not gone to the inferior agents,
</p>
<p>and put into prison this person or that person, who
</p>
<p>had acted a subordinate part ; nor have we prose-
</p>
<p>cuted the unfortunate people who were collected to-
</p>
<p>gether by the machinery of repeal wardens, for at-
</p>
<p>tending illegal meetings. Ko ; we have at once
</p>
<p>joined issuewith Mr. O'Connell, and we have said 
</p>
<p>" We will take the opinion of a court of law, we will
</p>
<p>take the opinion of a jury, whether what you say
</p>
<p>is or is not true, that all these proceedings are
</p>
<p>consistent with the law." This is the course we
</p>
<p>have adopted ; and, therefore, we are not to be
</p>
<p>taunted with having adopted the contrivance of
</p>
<p>prosecuting for conspiracy, or with having brought
</p>
<p>the actions of one man to bear upon another. No ;
</p>
<p>but having demonstrated each of these persons to
</p>
<p>have pursued a particular line of conduct, for which
</p>
<p>line of conduct he must be answerable, if the result
</p>
<p>of that conduct be to show, not only that he may
</p>
<p>have in the particular instance violated the law, as
</p>
<p>for instance in the publication of a libel, but also to
</p>
<p>show that he has identified himself with a body,
</p>
<p>with a combination, with a movement that is ille-
</p>
<p>gal, we do not visit that man with the guilt of an-
</p>
<p>other, but we visit on him the legal and inevitable

<p>consequences of his own act, and fasten upon him

<p>content and dissatisfaction

<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Disaffection.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  Disaffection amongst the
</p>
<p>Queen's suhjects, and to e.xcite them to hatred and
</p>
<p>unlairful opposition to the government and consti-
</p>
<p>tution of the realm. The second charge is, conspir-
</p>
<p>ing to stir up jealousies amongst the Queen's sub-
</p>
<p>jects, and to promote ill-will to other subjects of
</p>
<p>the Queen, especially with regard to Ireland against
</p>
<p>England. The third is, to excite disaffection in the
</p>
<p>army. The fourth is, to collect unlawful assem-
</p>
<p>blies in large numbers in Ireland, in order to obtain
</p>
<p>changes in the laws and constitution, by intimida-
</p>
<p>tion and the demonstration of force. 'The fifth is,
</p>
<p>to bring the courts of justice established by law into
</p>
<p>disrepute, and with the intention to induce the sub-
</p>
<p>jects of her Majesty to submit their disputes to
</p>
<p>other tribunals, and to induce the Queen's subjects
</p>
<p>to withdraw the settlement of their disputes from
</p>
<p>the tribunals by law established, aud to resort to
</p>
<p>other modes of adjudication. Now the latter is ra-
</p>
<p>ther a repetition of the previous part of this fifth
</p>
<p>charge of conspiiacy, and we may say the last al-
</p>
<p>leged object is to bring the courts of justice est.a-
</p>
<p>blished by law into disrepute, and with the intention
</p>
<p>to induce the subjects to submit their disputes to
</p>
<p>other tribunals. Now, gentlemen, what I have
</p>
<p>stated to you is contained in an indictment consist-
</p>
<p>ing of eleven counts ; the first count, containhig all
</p>
<p>the several charges of conspiracy tliat I have enu-

<p>merated to you, accompanied with divers and sin-

<p>gular overt acts, or means by which those objects
</p>
<p>were to be carried into effect. Those overt acts are
</p>
<p>not part of the conspiracy, but they are inserted in
</p>
<p>the indictment as a statement of the evidence by
</p>
<p>which the charge of conspiracy is to be supported.
</p>
<p>Those overt acts are introduced into the indictment
</p>
<p>for the purpose, and the laudable purpose, of giving
</p>
<p>the parties who are accused of the conspiracy notice
</p>
<p>of the particular facts, by which the crown intend
</p>
<p>to support their charge of the conspiracy in ques-
</p>
<p>tion. Now, these overt acts are in evidence ; and
</p>
<p>the question is not so much as to the existence of
</p>
<p>the particular overt acts laid, as the conspiracy of
</p>
<p>which they are stated as the evidence. But it is
</p>
<p>not the effect of the evidence, but the alleged result,
</p>
<p>that you will have to decide ; and you will have to
</p>
<p>say, not whether the overt acts took place, but
</p>
<p>whether the parties accused are guilty of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. Now you see, gentlemen, it is very im-
</p>
<p>portant in the outset, you should take and store in
</p>
<p>your minds a very clear and distinct idea of the
</p>
<p>p.articulars of the alleged conspiracy. It is, as I
</p>
<p>have stated to you, or it may be said to be, consist-
</p>
<p>ing of five parts : First, to excite  I will go over
</p>
<p>them .again, as it is necessary that those matters
</p>
<p>should be kept most specially distinct in your minds.
</p>
<p>The first is, to create discontent and disaffection
</p>
<p>amongst the Queen's subjects, and to excite them
</p>
<p>to hatred and unlawful opposition to the govern-
</p>
<p>ment and constitution of the country. Secondly,
</p>
<p>to stir up jealousies amongst the Queen's subjects,
</p>
<p>and to promote ill-will from one class of the sub-
</p>
<p>jects against another, especially of Ireland against
</p>
<p>England. The third is, to excite disaffection in the
</p>
<p>THE CHARGE OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE,
</p>
<p>449
</p>
<p>of which the present  (and I do not mean to sny
</p>
<p>this, anticipating one way or the other  God for-
</p>
<p>bid  what conclusion you may come to upon tlie
</p>
<p>subject,)  but if secrecy were a necessary ingre-
</p>
<p>dient in tlie crime of conspiracy, the present charge
</p>
<p>might liave been carried on from beginning to its
</p>
<p>final consummation, and tlie parties never stopped
</p>
<p>in tiieir progress, or charged with the crime of
</p>
<p>conspiracy. I put it rather now by way of ex-
</p>
<p>ample, than as bearing iipon the present case ;
</p>
<p>and I desire that in what I have said, there may be
</p>
<p>rejected from your minds all feeling as if I were
</p>
<p>giving anything like an opinion, or anything bor-
</p>
<p>dering upon an opinion, with regard to the facts of
</p>
<p>tliis case, which will be for your final decision.
</p>
<p>But I was putting it by way of exemplification.
</p>
<p>Secrecy might not be and would not be necessary.
</p>
<p>If the parties conspired, that is, agreed together, in
</p>
<p>common ends, to overawe the parliament of the
</p>
<p>country, to cause alarm and terror amongst her
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects, or the collecting together in the
</p>
<p>open day large bodies of the people, the more nu-
</p>
<p>merous, the more public, the more likely to accom-
</p>
<p>plish the end of the party  that calling together,
</p>
<p>forming part of the crime with which he is charged,
</p>
<p>his object being all along to create terror, and in-
</p>
<p>timidation, and overawing, this would be brought
</p>
<p>about more by public demonstration than by secrecy
</p>
<p>or concealment. Now, gentlemen, therefore, I put
</p>
<p>that as an instance to you, to show the fallacy of
</p>
<p>those who have insisted and required, that as a ne-
</p>
<p>cessary ingredient in the cliarge.pf conspiracy there
</p>
<p>should be established to the sat^action of the jury

<p>were cited by Mr. Fitzgibbon in his argument, both
</p>
<p>upon the first day, when he insisted upon the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of treachery, and on the second day, when he
</p>
<p>insisted also, or perhaps in the alternative, upon the
</p>
<p>existence of secrecy. I have looked into those
</p>
<p>authorities, and I am bound to say that they do not
</p>
<p>support the proposition for which he brought them
</p>
<p>forward ; and I would say farther, that I am some-
</p>
<p>what surprised at the statement which he made with
</p>
<p>regard to some of the cases to which he referred, as
</p>
<p>if they contained any ground foi- the introduction
</p>
<p>of any such proposition. I have looked carefully
</p>
<p>through them all, and without troubling yon with
</p>
<p>a recapitulation of those several cases, I have to
</p>
<p>Bay that, in my judgn)ent, and iu the opinion of
</p>
<p>the court, there is not one of them which supports
</p>
<p>the proposition for which they were cited, that iu
</p>
<p>order to substantiate the charge of conspiracy either
</p>
<p>treachery or secrecy is necessary. The definition
</p>
<p>of conspiracy I have already stated to you, as we
</p>
<p>hold the law to be the mutual concert and design of
</p>
<p>two or more to bring about an end illegal in itself,
</p>
<p>or an end abstractedly legal in itself, but to be
</p>
<p>brought about by illegal means. That is a conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. That you see, will include within it, wherever
</p>
<p>they exist, the charge of treachery, or the charge of
</p>
<p>secrecy, but they are not confined to them, and
</p>
<p>those are not a necessary or essential ingredients in
</p>
<p>the existence of conspiracy. But Jlr. Fitzgibbon
</p>
<p>insisted, that the definition which I have given of
</p>
<p>conspiracy has been found fault with or overruled,
</p>
<p>in a case to which he referred, by Lord Denman,
</p>
<p>the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench in England 
</p>
<p>the person who is alleged to have first introduced
</p>
<p>450
</p>
<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>taken that definition ; and lie said with an earnest-
</p>
<p>ness to excite your attention, that tliat was not the
</p>
<p>law, for that by the law as it existed so long ago as
</p>
<p>the reign of Edward the First, notliing could be a
</p>
<p>conspiracy but within a certain definition set out in
</p>
<p>an old act of parliament at that time, from whence
</p>
<p>it could be inferred that nothing was conspiracy
</p>
<p>except an unlawful association of men bound toge-
</p>
<p>ther by oath or other illegal obligation, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of imposing a false accusation against another
</p>
<p>man, or something of the same kind. And lie re-
</p>
<p>ferred to a passage in Hawlcins, as stating that to be
</p>
<p>the law of the country. Now, if that were the law
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, it would not have supported Mr.
</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon. Wliat he was then insisting upon, was
</p>
<p>the existence of treachery ; there would not neces-
</p>
<p>sarily have been treachery, in the rule as he so
</p>
<p>stated it, as laid down by Hawkins, and taken from
</p>
<p>the old act of parliament in tlie reign of Edward tlie
</p>
<p>First. That was stated by liim from 1st Hawkins,
</p>
<p>page 444 ; but he forgot to add to that, that in two
</p>
<p>pages after, page 446, Mr. Curwood, a gentleman
</p>
<p>at the bar, who published tlie last edition of Haw-
</p>
<p>kins (from which Mr. Fitzgibbon had taken his
</p>
<p>quotation), stated thus: " Modern cases," says Mr.
</p>
<p>Curwood, " have certainly stretched the doctrine
</p>
<p>of conspiracy far beyond the old rule of law," (this
</p>
<p>is the book to which Mr. Fitzgibbon referred,) " in
</p>
<p>the opinion of Lord Ellenborough it ought not to be
</p>
<p>pushed farther;" which was an observation made
</p>
<p>by him, when a case was brought before him, of an
</p>
<p>accusation of conspiracy against two or more per-
</p>
<p>sons for attempting to wire hares in a geutleman's
</p>
<p>preserve ; that is carrying the law too far, and ac-

</p>
<p>cordingly Lord Ellenborough said that is too much.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood says (here is the way in which he ex-
</p>
<p>plains the law)  " lately the offence was considered
</p>
<p>to consist in a combination to impose a false crime
</p>
<p>upon any person, or in other words, to convict an
</p>
<p>innocsnt person by perversion of the law and by
</p>
<p>perjury ;" but, gentlemen, he states, very properly,
</p>
<p>that the ancient law has long since been extended
</p>
<p>far beyond the cases to which it was then confined,
</p>
<p>namely, in the reign of Edward the First. I need
</p>
<p>not go further  there is a multiplicity of cases, in
</p>
<p>which that extension of the rule of law has been
</p>
<p>established ; acted on by courts of justice, by the
</p>
<p>unanimous opinions of judges, and never questioned,
</p>
<p>in order to establish from whence the rule as now
</p>
<p>laid down is deduced, namely, in the general way
</p>
<p>in which I began by stating it, and from which I
</p>
<p>think that it is by no means necessary, that treachery
</p>
<p>or secrecy should, one or either of them, form an
</p>
<p>ingredient to the crime of conspiracy, as the law
</p>
<p>now looks upon it, although they may be included
</p>
<p>in it. Now, I believe, gentlemen, I have I hope
</p>
<p>told you to take the law from the court ; and having
</p>
<p>thus stated explicitly what the law of conspiracy is
</p>
<p>not, and what it is, I forbear troubhng you again
</p>
<p>with cases upon the subject, upon which I and the
</p>
<p>rest of my brethren with me have come to the satis-
</p>
<p>factory conclusion which I have stated, and the
</p>
<p>terms in which I have announced the law of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy. Now, gentlemen of the jury, having tlius
</p>
<p>stated to you what it is the traversers are accused
</p>
<p>of, I think it wo\ild be right for me also to lay down
</p>
<p>a few other rules with regard to conspiracy, that
</p>
<p>you may hereafter see their proper bearing upon this

</p>
<p>Tierney I should jnit this question to you if you
</p>
<p>are satisfied that he did then join them, did lie at
</p>
<p>that time adopt the association as it stood, witli all
</p>
<p>its acts and criminality (if such existed) as it then
</p>
<p>did exist ? I perhaps anticipate, but I thought I
</p>
<p>might as well here make that observation with re-
</p>
<p>gard to Mr. Tierney, because I found, that in read-
</p>
<p>ing the judgment of Judge Coleridge, in this case of
</p>
<p>the Queen v. Murphy, I was obliged to introduce that
</p>
<p>passage which I have detailed, and it appeared to me
</p>
<p>to be the fit opportunity of stating what I might call
</p>
<p>a qualification. I do not mean to quarrel with what
</p>
<p>Judge Coleridge has said, but tliat in this case I
</p>
<p>should prefer leaving it to you to consider and pro-
</p>
<p>nounce whether or not the qualification applies to
</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney or not. Now, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>I will come to the question of the traversers at
</p>
<p>large ; and I hope you have taken down those obser-
</p>
<p>vations with regard to the law of conspiracy, wliich
</p>
<p>I have endeavoured distinctly to detail to you. It
</p>
<p>is very fitting that the law should be distinctly un-
</p>
<p>derstood, and not be the subject of any doubt or
</p>
<p>apprehension when it comes to be applied. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men', before I go into the observations upon this par-
</p>
<p>ticular case, I sliould like to read to j'ou certain ob-
</p>
<p>servations, which I would adopt as my own, in a
</p>
<p>case to which the court was referred by Mr. Sheil in
</p>
<p>his able statement in behalf of the traversers. He
</p>
<p>referred us to the case of the Iving r. Kirwan, which
</p>
<p>was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland,
</p>
<p>and the able speech (as he pronounced it to be) of
</p>
<p>the late Mr. Peter Burrowes, who was counsel for
</p>
<p>the traversers, their leading counsel ; Mr. O'Connell
</p>
<p>appears to have been ('ounsel with him. Of Mr.

<p>Burrowes, I concur fully in the statement that has
</p>
<p>been made with regard to that very eminent man ;
</p>
<p>he was an able and a most constitutional lawyer,
</p>
<p>and I believe I may venture to say of him without
</p>
<p>going out of my way, that there was no man who
</p>
<p>ever appeared before the public to whom popular
</p>
<p>rights were dearer, or who more eflTectively exerted
</p>
<p>himself on behalf of the people at large. If he had
</p>
<p>a failing, it certainly was not an aristocratical bias
</p>
<p>against the popular rights ; therefore what fell from
</p>
<p>him upon the occasion when he made that speecli,
</p>
<p>to which Mr. Sheil referred, is very worthy of con-
</p>
<p>sideration, and is not altogether inapplicable to the
</p>
<p>present case. In page 203 of his address to the
</p>
<p>jury he says thus :.  "It is very evident that to as-
</p>
<p>sume such a right," that is, a right to represent the
</p>
<p>people, or any portion of them, " would be to en-
</p>
<p>croach upon the exclusive privileges of the house of
</p>
<p>commons, and no man can doubt but that to assume
</p>
<p>the character or exercise the functions of any de-
</p>
<p>partment in the state, legislative, executive, or ju-
</p>
<p>dicial, is and always was a high misdemeanour." I
</p>
<p>subscribe to that proposition. In page 205 of the
</p>
<p>same address he goes on thus :.  " Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, we are surfeited with visionary notions and re-
</p>
<p>publican declamations ; we have lost our relish for
</p>
<p>the old, I hope not obsolete principles of liberty, so
</p>
<p>cherished by our ancestors. From the abuse of
</p>
<p>things of the highest worth, we begin to forget their
</p>
<p>value. This, gentlemen, is a most dangerous state,
</p>
<p>and a most permanent evil ; every important inva-
</p>
<p>sion of a right has been founded upon an abuse of
</p>
<p>that right, and has succeeded through the apathy
</p>
<p>created by such abuse. Let us never fall into this

<p>Britain and Ireland into one kingdom in sucli man-
</p>
<p>ner and on sucli terms and conditions as may be
</p>
<p>estalilished by the acts of tlie respective parliaments
</p>
<p>of Great Britain and Ireland." There is a recital
</p>
<p>of a national compact for the future union of the
</p>
<p>two countries of Great Britain and Ireland sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned by their respective legislatures, in the same
</p>
<p>solemn way in wliich the act of union between
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Scotland had been transacted and
</p>
<p>accomplished one hundred years before:  " Article
</p>
<p>first' That it be the first article of the union of
</p>
<p>the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland that the
</p>
<p>said kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland shall,
</p>
<p>upon the first day of January, which shall be in the
</p>
<p>year of our Loi'd 1801, and for ever after, be united
</p>
<p>into one kingdom, by the name of 'The United
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.' " By that
</p>
<p>article, from the passing of the act of union, the
</p>
<p>kingdom of Great Britain ceased to exist, the king-
</p>
<p>dom of Ireland ceased to exist, and instead of those
</p>
<p>two, there was formed one united kingdom under
</p>
<p>the style and title of " the United Kingdom of Great
</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland." Not one king thenceforth
</p>
<p>having two kingdoms under his dominion, but from
</p>
<p>thenceforth one king having one kingdom designated
</p>
<p>as in that article; and the idea of saying that the
</p>
<p>Queen of Ireland may be treated or dealt with as
</p>
<p>the Queen of a separate kingdom is absurd, is sedi-
</p>
<p>tious. Until the law be altered by the proper au-

<p>thority  (which I do not say but it may)  but
</p>
<p>while the law remains as it is up to this time, as it

</p>
<p>class of his subjects except the legislature, with re-
</p>
<p>gard to a new constitution, or new laws with respect
</p>
<p>to any part of the united kingdom. And I say, more-
</p>
<p>over, whatever subject would take upon himself
</p>
<p>to inculcate  to proclaim amongst the subjects of
</p>
<p>this part of the united kingdom, that he or any
</p>
<p>body else, abstracted from the legislature, had a
</p>
<p>power either separately by himself, or jointly
</p>
<p>with any portion of the inhabitants of thi's part
</p>
<p>of the united kingdom, of treating with the
</p>
<p>Queen for the abrogation of the existing law,
</p>
<p>and to put in its place a new law, such as we
</p>
<p>have heard suggested, is guilty of an oflence, is
</p>
<p>guilty of the crime of sedition ; and that if her
</p>
<p>Majesty was please to condescend to treat and ne-
</p>
<p>gotiate with him separately from her parliament,
</p>
<p>and to adopt his suggestions, she has not the power
</p>
<p>to do it without violating her coronation oath. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, see what the other articles of the act of
</p>
<p>union are  " That it be the second article of union
</p>
<p>that the succession to the imperial crown of the said
</p>
<p>united kingdom, and of the dominions thereunto
</p>
<p>belonging, shall continue limited and settled in the
</p>
<p>same manner as the succession to the imperial crown

<p>of the said kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland
</p>
<p>now stands limited and settled according to the
</p>
<p>existing laws, and to the terms of union between

<p>England and Scotland." Scotland, as well as Eng-
</p>
<p>land, was a party to the act of union with Ireland.

<p>Article the third is" That it be the third article

<p>453
</p>
<p>quest and in the law on the subject as laid down by
</p>
<p>the eminent judge by whom this charge to the grand
</p>
<p>jury was delivered. " There is one case in the
</p>
<p>calendar as to wliich it is desirable that I should
</p>
<p>address you. In that case four persons are cliarged
</p>
<p>with having, 'on tlie 19th of April, at Newport,
</p>
<p>unlawfully met, witli divers otlier persons, calling
</p>
<p>themselves Chartists, unlawfully intending to disturb
</p>
<p>the peace of this realm, and to excite discontent,
</p>
<p>disaffection, and hatred to the government and con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the country.' " That is very like the
</p>
<p>object alleged to be the illegal object of the traver-
</p>
<p>sers in the charge of conspiracy upon which they
</p>
<p>are now standing their trial. " This charge," says
</p>
<p>Baron Alderson, " is a misdemeanour of a serious
</p>
<p>nature, if satisfactorily proved ; and it will be for
</p>
<p>you to say upon the evidence, whether these persons
</p>
<p>have outstepped the line of their duty, and instead
</p>
<p>of confining themselves to the temperate and proper
</p>
<p>representation of such grievances, which they either
</p>
<p>endure, or think they endure, have constituted them-
</p>
<p>selves into that which, in point of law, is an unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful assembly of the people. To ascertain what is an
</p>
<p>unlawful assembly, it is well that we should see what
</p>
<p>our best lawyers have laid down with respect to
</p>
<p>unla^i-ful assemblies. Mr. Sergeant Hawkins, one of
</p>
<p>the best authorities on this subject, says, that ' any
</p>
<p>meeting whatsover of great numbers of people, with
</p>
<p>such circumstances of terror as cannot but endanger
</p>
<p>the public peixce, and raise fears and jealousies among
</p>
<p>tlie king's subjects, seems properly to be called an
</p>
<p>unlawful assembly ; as where great numbers com-
</p>
<p>plaining of a common grievance meet together,
</p>
<p>armed in a warlike manner, in order to consult to-

</p>
<p>gether concerning the most proper means for tlie
</p>
<p>recovery of their interests, for no one can foresee
</p>
<p>what may be the event of such an assembly. So in
</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt's case, which was tried at York, and after-
</p>
<p>wards came before the Court of Queen's Bench, Mr.
</p>
<p>Justice Bayley (than whom no man was more learned
</p>
<p>in the laws, or more enlightened in his views,) says,
</p>
<p>' if the pei-sons who assemble together say  we will
</p>
<p>hare what we want whether it be according to law
</p>
<p>or not, a meeting'for such a purpose, however it may
</p>
<p>be masked, if it be really for a purpose of that kind,
</p>
<p>is illegal. If a meeting from its general appearance,
</p>
<p>and from all the accompanying circumstances, is
</p>
<p>calculated to exi-ite terror, alarm, and consternation,
</p>
<p>it is generally crimin.al and unlawful.' Tliese are,
</p>
<p>as I take it, the clear principles of law." Then he
</p>
<p>goes on to define the difference between an unlawful
</p>
<p>assembly and a riot, with which I need not trouble
</p>
<p>you. " You will investigate the circumstances under
</p>
<p>which the assembly took place  whether the indivi-
</p>
<p>duals who presided and were present, were so by
</p>
<p>previous concert, or accidentally having met.  and
</p>
<p>if they met by previous concert, you will inquire
</p>
<p>whether they have met at unseasonable hours of the
</p>
<p>night  if they liave met under circumstances of
</p>
<p>violence and danger  if they have been armed with
</p>
<p>offensive weapons or used violent language  if they
</p>
<p>have proposed to set the different classes of society
</p>
<p>at variance the one witli the other, and to put to
</p>
<p>death any part of her Majesty's subjects ; if any, all,
</p>
<p>or most of these things should appear before you.
</p>
<p>there will, I think, be little difficulty in saying that
</p>
<p>an assembly of such persons under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances, for such purposes, and using such language

</p>
<p>and their conduct were to come before us in a court 1
</p>
<p>of justice, we should (however painful it would be
</p>
<p>to be placed in such a situation) act towards them
</p>
<p>also exactly as we ought now to act towards the
</p>
<p>present defendants." Now, gentlemen of the jury,
</p>
<p>there is the constitutional law laid down by this
</p>
<p>very eminent constitutional lawyer, Baron Alder-
</p>
<p>son. No man is more highly respected in the pro-
</p>
<p>fession, and no man is more eminent in a court of
</p>
<p>justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Whiteside  I believe they were acquitted of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy there, my lord.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  Yes, they were acquitted
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy, and found guilty of attending
</p>
<p>unlawful assemblies. That is another part of what
</p>
<p>Baron Alderson said. I fully concur with Baron
</p>
<p>Alderson in both parts, both in his charge to the
</p>
<p>grand jury, and in his charge to the petty jury ; and
</p>
<p>in that I have the full and entire approbation and
</p>
<p>concurrence, of ray learned brethren (and you must
</p>
<p>take that also into your consideration) to be the law.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, let me not be misunderstood
</p>
<p>as Baron Alderson was misunderstood. If a man
</p>
<p>has a grievance  if any set of men have a grievance,
</p>
<p>or if they tliink, or fancy they have a grievance, it
</p>
<p>is no crime for a man to have the grievance, or to
</p>
<p>think he has it ; it is no crime to make a mistake
</p>
<p>with regard to his political position in respect of that
</p>
<p>alleged grievance. He has a right also to communi-
</p>
<p>cate freely his sentiments upon that subject to his
</p>
<p>fellows, similarly circumstanced or otherwise. He
</p>
<p>has a right to make that communication not merely
</p>
<p>to his friends or fellows but to strangers  he has a
</p>
<p>right to make those conmiunications and those com-

</p>
<p>plaints wherever he goes, if he thinks fit. Even if
</p>
<p>he should attend a public meeting, however large
</p>
<p>that meeting may be, though in that respect it may
</p>
<p>happen indeed to be dangerous in respect to the
</p>
<p>consequences that may follow from it, but the mere
</p>
<p>fact of its being a public meeting is no reason why
</p>
<p>a man who has a grievance, or thinks he lias, sliould
</p>
<p>not attend that meeting, make a statement of what
</p>
<p>he conceives he has to complain of, and so upon the
</p>
<p>principle of free discussion endeavour to get, by
</p>
<p>peaceable means, as many allies and advocates in
</p>
<p>support of his alleged grievance as he can procure.
</p>
<p>That, gentlemen, is the law, and that is the liberality
</p>
<p>of the law, as stated by Mr. Baron Alderson, whicli
</p>
<p>he said " God forbid" the country should ever be
</p>
<p>without, and which I say too. But, gentlemen, in
</p>
<p>order to disseminate the knowledge of those griev-
</p>
<p>ances, he must take care not to infringe upon the
</p>
<p>rights and liberties of others ; and he is the more
</p>
<p>bound to be careful as to the effect of what he does,
</p>
<p>if the assemblies which he attends are congregated
</p>
<p>in such multitudes as to excite terror and alarm,
</p>
<p>either amongst the neighbouring people, or amongst
</p>
<p>those who are bound to watch over, and preserve
</p>
<p>the peace and constitution of the country. If he
</p>
<p>goes with arms it is the more likely that the law
</p>
<p>will be infringed, but if he goes without arms  which
</p>
<p>has been the cause always here  it does not follow,
</p>
<p>therefore, that that meeting has been lawful. I do
</p>
<p>not mean to say, but the contrary, that the mere
</p>
<p>attending of the meeting, however large the num-
</p>
<p>bers may be, if no breach of the peace be committed,
</p>
<p>nor tendency to a breach of the peace, at the time,

<p>their judgments to come to a difTerent opinion upon

<p>this or that political subject, are they the only

<p>persons who are not to have the advantage of free

<p>the class of nations ; and you may differ from me if

<p>you like, but take care ; the first step you make,

<p>those masses that are now dissolving at my command

</p>

<p>take ? Take care of that. Is that the way in which
</p>
<p>the country is to be suffered to remain ? Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, if you come to be of opinion that that was the
</p>
<p>object of the persons who collected those multitu-
</p>
<p>dinous meetings, that their object was not what they
</p>
<p>professed, to consider of grievances, to talk over and
</p>
<p>discuss them, to lay a petition before that parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, the legality of whose existence they are deny-
</p>
<p>ing if you believe that that was not their object,
</p>
<p>but on the contrary that it was for the purpose of
</p>
<p>procuring intimidation and overawing the counsels of
</p>
<p>the legislature and the government of the state, then
</p>
<p>I am of opinion, gentlemen, that in that latter case,
</p>
<p>and with that latter object, their object was unlawful,
</p>
<p>and if more than one liave concurred to procure it
</p>
<p>by unlawful means, they are guilty of the act of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. I have already said, gentlemen of the jury,

<p>that the doing of such a thing bj' one is not enough
</p>
<p>to constitute a conspiracy  there must be a con-
</p>
<p>currence of two or more in the same criminal design.
</p>
<p>Before we go to the consideration of the particular
</p>
<p>case of each, I will make some furtlier observations
</p>
<p>which seem to me to apply to the case of all. The
</p>
<p>traversers one and all say that they are repealers,
</p>
<p>that is to say, that they are persons who conscien-
</p>
<p>tiously entertain the view that the object of repeal
</p>
<p>is best suited to the interests of the country, and
</p>
<p>say, that for that, and on that account they have
</p>
<p>grievances. I will not now enter into the allega-
</p>
<p>tions which have been put forwanl, and with which
</p>
<p>this court was occupied for several days, as to the
</p>
<p>ground and manner in whieli the act of union was
</p>
<p>carried. It is forty-flirce years ago since the king,
</p>
<p>lords, and commons, of the two countries passed
</p>
<p>that act of parliament. And by their common con-
</p>
<p>currence the act of union has continued in force,
</p>
<p>and is in force, up to tliis hour. Very many acts of
</p>
<p>parUament have been passed within the last forty-
</p>
<p>three years by the united parliament. In those
</p>
<p>acts of parliameut the members who were returned
</p>
<p>for Ireland, the members who were returned for
</p>
<p>Scotland, the members who were returned for Eng-
</p>
<p>land, all had their share. They all voted, or had
</p>
<p>an opportunity of voting, and of speaking, and the
</p>
<p>privilege of free discussion to the utmost extent of
</p>
<p>the word. Very many most important acts of par-
</p>
<p>liament have been passed which ought to have been
</p>
<p>passed according to the deliberative judgment of
</p>
<p>the united parliament  not one kingdom taking on
</p>
<p>itself to judge or act for another  not one part of
</p>
<p>the kingdom taking on itself to judge or act for the

</p>
<p>sion, without givilig any undue offence to any body
</p>
<p>.  he had a right so to deliver liimself. Now what
</p>
<p>has that to say to the events of 1843? I confess it
</p>
<p>J9 the first time I ever knew of a man, (or set of
</p>
<p>men,) accused of a specific crime or crimes in the
</p>
<p>year 1843, seeking to justify themselves from tliat
</p>
<p>charge, by proof of wliat he or tliey respectively did
</p>
<p>forty or thirty or fourteen years back. And that
</p>
<p>because a man's experience in the way of political
</p>
<p>writing at one time, may be given in evidence to
</p>
<p>show his intentions as to certain expressions or acts
</p>
<p>done by him twelve years afterwards, as in the case
</p>
<p>of Hnrne Tooke ; then is it to be inferred from that,
</p>
<p>that a similar course of proceeding is to be adopted
</p>
<p>in this case? Now there is this wide difference be-
</p>
<p>tween the two classes. Home Tooke was accused
</p>
<p>of very questionable matter, both as to what he
</p>
<p>wrote and as to what lie did. and he was permitted
</p>
<p>to give a construction to that questionable matter,
</p>
<p>on the principle of continuity of purpose, and to give
</p>
<p>a colour (perhaps the true colour) to the matter for
</p>
<p>which he was then tried, by the evidence of his pre-
</p>
<p>vious opinions and acts, though they Irad taken place
</p>
<p>and been expressed several years before. The cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances were similar ; the existence and charac-
</p>
<p>ter of the assemblages was similar, and they were
</p>
<p>perfectly admissable in that case which was then
</p>
<p>tried by the proper colour, which gave a character
</p>
<p>to the position in which Home Tooke stood; they
</p>
<p>were properly admitted in that case- Can tliat be
</p>
<p>said of the present case ? Two speeches made at
</p>
<p>public assemblies, convened by the sheriffs for the
</p>
<p>city of Dublin in the one case, and I believe the
</p>
<p>lord mayor in the other public speeches made, re-

<p>sohitions passed, petitions forwarded to the crown,
</p>
<p>and presented by the city representatives  what
</p>
<p>analogy has that to the case in which Mr. Daniel
</p>
<p>O'Connell is represented on all hands to liave stood
</p>
<p>in 1843 ? Were these meetings convened by magis-
</p>
<p>trates? I dont mean to say there were not magis-
</p>
<p>trates present. Were they convened magisterially ?
</p>
<p>Was any of them convened magisterially ? Not
</p>
<p>one, that I am aware of. Were any of them con-
</p>
<p>vened by orders and directions of the national repeal
</p>
<p>association? We have Mr. O'Connell's answer to
</p>
<p>that, stating the number of monster meetings which
</p>
<p>he had caused to be convened for his own purposes.
</p>
<p>The cases therefore are in their existing circum-
</p>
<p>stances quite different. But supposing that were
</p>
<p>not so : after all, what is the meaning of those
</p>
<p>words " continuity of purpose ?" I have no objec-
</p>
<p>tion to its going to the jury on tli.at; it must go to
</p>
<p>the jury, and you shall have the full benefit of it.
</p>
<p>Now in the year 1843 there had subsisted for a con-
</p>
<p>siderable time, as nmch at least as three years be-
</p>
<p>fore, an association in the city of Dublin, which was
</p>
<p>called the national repeal association. Sir Colman
</p>
<p>O'Loghlen was desirous that I should take notice,
</p>
<p>that in a short time, I believe a few months after the
</p>
<p>formation of the repeal association, an improvement
</p>
<p>was made upou its name by the introduction of the
</p>
<p>word " Loyal," and that from thenceforward it bore,
</p>
<p>and has borne, the name  the loyal national repeal
</p>
<p>association (I do not know whether I put the words
</p>
<p>right) ; whether tliat be or not of any importance is
</p>
<p>for you to judge. I do not wish to keep the facts from
</p>
<p>you, but to submit them to you, and to submit them
</p>
<p>all to you ; that is to say, that no portion of the facts
</p>

</p>
<p>427
</p>
<p>it is for the jury to say, are they satisfied upon the
</p>
<p>facts laid before theui, that though the actual time
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy is not prove 1, yet tjiat tliey are
</p>
<p>satisfied that sucli a conspiracy as is imputed must
</p>
<p>have taken place, from the facts that are admitted,
</p>
<p>or proved to have taken place, coming from one or
</p>
<p>more different parties charged with this conspiracy,
</p>
<p>for the furtherance of the common design. The
</p>
<p>onus of that lies upon tlie crown ; and, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>you must be satisfied that tiie guilt which is so
</p>
<p>imputed, has been i)roved ; that is, that satisfactory
</p>
<p>evidence be given to you of tlie existence of the
</p>
<p>alleged conspiracy, the alleged compact, the alleged
</p>
<p>agreement and common design between the several
</p>
<p>traversers, or some of them ; and if you are not sa-
</p>
<p>tisfied by them, I am bound to say, gentlemen, if
</p>
<p>that is not made out to your minds, so as to leave it
</p>
<p>above and beyond reasonable doubt upon the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, it will be your duty not to convict upon pre-
</p>
<p>sumption ; you are to convict only upon proof, either
</p>
<p>direct or inferential, of the nature I have stated to
</p>
<p>you. The onus is on the crown ; and that is another
</p>
<p>reason why I pass over without more particular de-
</p>
<p>tail the evidence given on behalf of the traversers.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen of the jury, the nature of the proof
</p>
<p>given by the crown is tliis ; it will be for you to
</p>
<p>say, are you satisfied or are you not, with the way
</p>
<p>in which the crown has proved its case.
</p>
<p>The court here retired for a few minutes, and

</p>
<p>The Cluef Justice continued  Gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, the crown say, and I think there is evidence
</p>
<p>to support the statement, that some time in the
</p>
<p>beginning of 1843, a material alteration took place

</p>
<p>in the system and regulations of the association, the
</p>
<p>repeal association. It had before that time become
</p>
<p>a very great body  I mean in point of numbers ; I
</p>
<p>believe also, very considerable sums of money had
</p>
<p>been sent in the way of contributions, both from
</p>
<p>various parts of this country, from Great Britain,
</p>
<p>from America, perhaps something from France: but
</p>
<p>I am not sure of that, and I will leave it out. It had
</p>
<p>had communications previously, as extending and
</p>
<p>ramifying in various directions, and through various
</p>
<p>districts of the country, liut in 1843 proceedings
</p>
<p>were adopted, for tlie purpose of rendering this com-
</p>
<p>munication and that system more extensive and
</p>
<p>more efficacious. A plan was adopted for a new me-
</p>
<p>thod of the admission of persons desirous to become
</p>
<p>members of that association. Classes were created,
</p>
<p>into which members were to be distributed, and
</p>
<p>under the name of which they were to be known.
</p>
<p>Those classes were three : the general class, who are
</p>
<p>called associates; every person who subscribed a
</p>
<p>certain small sum of money, amounting to only one
</p>
<p>shilling a year, was capable of becoming an associate
</p>
<p>upon obtaining a card of the society. Every person
</p>
<p>who paid one pound a year, was to be entitled to ad-
</p>
<p>mission as a member, and enrolled, obtaining a
</p>
<p>different kind of card : the second class were called
</p>
<p>members. The third class were called volunteers,
</p>
<p>and they who subscribed ten pounds, or procured
</p>
<p>subscriptions to that amount from otiiers, were
</p>
<p>entitled to be admitted .as volunteers ; and one and
</p>
<p>all of those persons were to be by a certain form ad-
</p>
<p>mitted into tlie society, and enrolled in its books.
</p>
<p>Now here was certainly a very strange, I was going
</p>
<p>to say, formidable mode of organisation, which was
</p>
<p>458

</p>
<p>respectirely proprietors of or engaged in certain
</p>
<p>newspapers in the city of Dublin ; I need not say
</p>
<p>one way or other as to the tendency of their con-
</p>
<p>tents. The repeal wardens were to take care, that
</p>
<p>within their respective districts a certain number of
</p>
<p>associates, that is, of the members of the association,
</p>
<p>should be provided, not with newspapers generally,
</p>
<p>of whatever class they might think necessary to in-
</p>
<p>form themselves in point of politics, not the Evening
</p>
<p>Mail, or a paper of that kind, but they were to take
</p>
<p>care that they were furnished with papers, and two
</p>
<p>of those papers were named, the Freeman's Journal,
</p>
<p>of which Dr. Gray is the proprietor, and the Pilot,
</p>
<p>of which Mr. Barrett is the proprietor. These
</p>
<p>were the papers named ; and if a certain number
</p>
<p>thought fit to choose another paper, and give direc-
</p>
<p>tions for that purpose, that they should be furnished
</p>
<p>accordingly ; that is, another paper of the same side
</p>
<p>of politics.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  My lord, with reference to Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, the indictment cliarges the distribution of the
</p>
<p>Morning Freeman, It was the Weekly Freeman tliat
</p>
<p>was sent according to the rule of the association, and
</p>
<p>there is no evidence that he is the proprietor of the
</p>
<p>weekly paper at all.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice Certainly .
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  The indictment charges the dis-
</p>
<p>tribution of the Morning Feteman, and, my lord, it
</p>
<p>was the Evening Freeman that was mentioned in the
</p>
<p>rules of the association, and the Weehly Freeman,
</p>
<p>whicli is quite a different paper.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I don't think it sig-
</p>
<p>nifies. I was stating that the papers reconmiended
</p>

<p>Mr. Sergeant Warren  Mr. Vernon, my lord, dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly proved that Dr. Gray was proprietor, both of
</p>
<p>the Morning and Weelihj Freeman,
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgibbon  There is no evidence whatever
</p>
<p>of tlie politics of the Weekly Fieeman.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice  I did not say the JFeekly
</p>
<p>one ; it was the Freeman and the Pilot were ex-
</p>
<p>pressly mentioned ; Mr. Barrett is the proprietor of
</p>
<p>the Pilot, and if there was a choice given, it was a
</p>
<p>choice witliin a certain circle. Now, gentlemen of
</p>
<p>the jury, you will consider what the effect of these
</p>
<p>papers was, circulated all over Ireland. The people
</p>
<p>of the country, the poor people who had subscribed
</p>
<p>their shilling a year, which amounts to about a far.
</p>
<p>thing a week  these people were to be enlightened
</p>
<p>by the dissemination of these papers, and by read-
</p>
<p>ing, or having them read to them ; and for that
</p>
<p>purpose the instructions that I have here in print
</p>
<p>before me gave directions, that if not very incon-
</p>
<p>venient, small places and rooms, in the way of read-
</p>
<p>ing rooms, should be selected in each district, where
</p>
<p>members of the society might assemble, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose no doubt of being indoctrinated in the system
</p>
<p>and objects of the society  the diffusion of useful
</p>
<p>knowledge  all that is done in direct communication
</p>
<p>with, and in constant communication with the so-
</p>
<p>ciety itself  the governing principle which actuated
</p>
<p>the entire, being in Dublin  the constant residence,
</p>
<p>as I may say, of the association. Now when you
</p>
<p>come to think of what the indictment is, these are
</p>
<p>matters that ought not to be kept, or permitted to
</p>
<p>go, out of your view, but ought to be kept con-
</p>
<p>stantly before you. Recollect what is complained of
</p>
<p>by the crown  a conspiracy by means of intimida-

<p>selves from adopting any course which we may
</p>
<p>think right at the conclusion of the charge ; hut I
</p>
<p>merely mention it in order that your lordships
</p>
<p>should not think we might he consenting to it. It
</p>
<p>might be afterwards open to the observation that we
</p>
<p>did not object to it.
</p>
<p>The Lord Cliief Justice You are quite right,
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, in saying so. Then, gentlemen, 1 have
</p>
<p>no right to assume tliat these documents are to be
</p>
<p>laid before you, that is, are to go into your box ;
</p>
<p>that makes it the more necessary for me to make a
</p>
<p>few observations on them, and in general my in-
</p>
<p>tention is not to go into minuteness of detail, but
</p>
<p>to give you genei'ally a correct notion of what the
</p>
<p>documents are, and to leave the subject then to your
</p>
<p>consideration. If I mistake or misstate the general
</p>
<p>object, the gentlemen of course will correct me.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, this was the general object of
</p>
<p>this member's card. Upon the face of it is inserted
</p>
<p>in green colours an enumeration of the powers, po-
</p>
<p>pulation, and ability of Ireland to Iiave a parlia-
</p>
<p>ment of her own ; and it concludes with a sort of
</p>
<p>chorus "And yet she has no parliament." Now
</p>
<p>whether she should have a parliament or not, does
</p>
<p>not depend upon IVIr. O'Conuell and the association.
</p>
<p>He may, and no doubt does, in common with very
</p>
<p>many who are of the same opinion with him, think
</p>
<p>conscientiously that she ought to have one ; I do not
</p>
<p>dispute at all liis entertaining that opinion, he and
</p>
<p>they have a perfect right to entertain it ; I do not
</p>
<p>mean to say that he and they are right, and I am
</p>
<p>wrong, if 1 differ from them on that subject. Tliat
</p>
<p>is not the question ; you have nothing to do with
</p>
<p>whether they are to liave a parliament or not ; you

<p>to disseminate upon the face of these cards, that

<p>from their strength and consequence they ought to

</p>
<p>country a statement of matter, upon which they,
</p>
<p>the members of the association, have no right to
</p>
<p>make a decision. They may have an opinion, they
</p>
<p>may circulate their opinion, they may endeavour to
</p>
<p>support it ; they have a right to state what they call

<p>their grievances ; and if they can enlist popular
</p>
<p>opinion in their favour by fair means, by legitimate
</p>
<p>means, they are perfectly entitled to do so : but
</p>
<p>upon the other hand, it is to be considered, when
</p>
<p>they are enrolling the whole country under stated
</p>
<p>officers, repeal wardens and repeal inspectors, and
</p>
<p>these cards are given and circulated, to be placed by
</p>
<p>those officers in the hands of the persons whom they
</p>
<p>get together as conscripts ; why, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, it is for you to consider with what intention
</p>
<p>that is done. Is it with the intention of free discus-
</p>
<p>sion, and expressing their candid, deliberate opinion,
</p>
<p>or is it with the intention of banding the persons

<p>among whom these cards are distributed, and these

</p>
<p>of a particular form of political views, entertained
</p>
<p>either by ilr. O'Counell, or by the members of that

<p>association? And is that intention to be furthered

<p>with the view of promoting free political discussion,

<p>ciation thus organised, thus disciplined, thus pro-
</p>
<p>vided witli funds, witli numbers unexampled, in
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell's hands for the working out of
</p>
<p>that which he professes to be the end and object
</p>
<p>of the association. He and the other traversers,
</p>
<p>by their counsel, make the case thattliisis all legiti-
</p>
<p>mate, and tliat inasmuch as they have a right to
</p>
<p>complain of the existence of the union as a griev-
</p>
<p>ance, they have a riglit by all legal means to get
</p>
<p>rid of the existence of that grievance; and so far
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General concurs with them. And the
</p>
<p>question merely between them is, wliether the
</p>
<p>means resorted to in tlie furtlierance of the objects
</p>
<p>of the traversers be or be not legal means, or, wlie-
</p>
<p>ther, in pursuing their object in the manner which
</p>
<p>they have adopted, they have not agreed and con-
</p>
<p>curred to transgress the law in the manner in which
</p>
<p>the Attorney-General accuses them in tlie present
</p>
<p>indictment. Now, as far as I know the legal means
</p>
<p>would be by addresses to the Queen, or to the par-
</p>
<p>liament, as by law established. There might be
</p>
<p>more ; they might, by the introduction of free and
</p>
<p>fair discussion, give weiglit to and extend the opi-
</p>
<p>nions entertained by tlie traversers with regard to
</p>
<p>the question of the union. But to do that there
</p>
<p>must be no intimidation ; that Is inconsistent with
</p>
<p>free discussion. Tliere must be no demonstration of
</p>
<p>physical force for the purpose of overawing or inti-
</p>
<p>midating her Majesty's ministers, or those who liave
</p>
<p>the direction of public aflairs ; and still less have
</p>
<p>they a right to take the law into their own hands,
</p>
<p>and by their own act make an alteration in the
</p>
<p>constitution and laws of the country different from

<p>by tlie sovereign and legislature of the country at
</p>
<p>tlie time. Now, having called your attention to the
</p>
<p>state of power, and organisation, and discipline to
</p>
<p>which they had carried that association, and its
</p>
<p>connections, see what tlieir acts are in furtherance
</p>
<p>of what they call tlieir legal intentions of carrying
</p>
<p>out their object. Tlie next instrument that I call
</p>
<p>your attention to, is an instrument that was laid
</p>
<p>before the association on the 22d of Augut, 1843,
</p>
<p>and it is called " A plan for the renewed action of
</p>
<p>the Irish parliament." Now, I have already very
</p>
<p>explicitly told you tliat as long as the act of union
</p>
<p>remained unaltered by the proper authoritj', the
</p>
<p>Queen was bound by her coronation oath to support
</p>
<p>it, and no set of persons in this country had a right,
</p>
<p>either by their demonstration of numbers, or power,
</p>
<p>or otherwise, to attempt to make an alteration in
</p>
<p>that law except through the medium of the legiti-
</p>
<p>mate authority  the sovereign and parliament of
</p>
<p>the country. Here is the association plan for
</p>
<p>making a new law and a new constitution in tliat
</p>
<p>part of the united kingdom called Ireland. " A
</p>
<p>plan for the renewed action of the Irish parliament.
</p>
<p>First  the Irish people recognise, acknowledge, and
</p>
<p>maintain, and will continually uphold and preserve
</p>
<p>upon the throne of Ireland her Majesty Queen Vic-
</p>
<p>toria, whom God protect  Queen by undoubted
</p>
<p>right, and by hereditary descent, of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>her heirs and successors for ever." From the time
</p>
<p>of passing the act of union, and now up to this
</p>
<p>day, she ceased to be Queen of Ireland. Tlie king
</p>
<p>at that time, and his successors since, ceased to be
</p>
<p>distinct kings or queens of Ireland ; by tlie effect
</p>
<p>of the act of union Ireland was swallowed up in the

<p>O'Conncll " Monster ileetiugs ;"' * and though it is
</p>
<p>not admitted liere tliat he or the association called
</p>
<p>more than a few of those monster meetings, yet you
</p>
<p>will see, gentlemen of the jury, hy the repeated
</p>
<p>declarations of Mr. Cl'Counell himself, that he or
</p>
<p>we, that is, he or the association, did call those
</p>
<p>monster meetings; and you will have to say whe-
</p>
<p>^ther or not this is another w.ay, and a more
</p>
<p>public way. of demonstrating the existing phy-
</p>
<p>sical force and powerful strength of the Irish na-
</p>
<p>tion, banded together by the ties of the association
</p>
<p>for effecting their object by such means as the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General has alluded to. I am not about
</p>
<p>to go through a detail of all the meetings that
</p>
<p>took place in the ditTerent parts of Ireland ; they
</p>
<p>have been stated to you by the Attorney, and by the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General, and with regard to the existence,
</p>
<p>and the actual taking place, of those great assemblies
</p>
<p>and monster meetings, there is no difference between
</p>
<p>the crown and the traversers. That such meetings
</p>
<p>were assembled, were brought together, and that
</p>
<p>they did take place under the circumstances that
</p>
<p>have been described, it would seem that both parties
</p>
<p>are agreed. I do not lay much stress upon the fact
</p>
<p>of there being bands of music. There were bands
</p>
<p>of music in almost every instance, perhaps in every
</p>
<p>instance, and those bands of music were in very
</p>
<p>great numbers  thirty or forty different bands of
</p>
<p>music at a single meeting. There were fl.ags, and
</p>
<p>there were banners, and there were inscriptions.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen of the jury, I do not lay much stress
</p>
<p>upon that; even though in some cases a violence of
</p>
<p>expression miglit appear upon some of those devices,
</p>
<p>they go but a little way to establish the crime im-

<p>puted, that is, in the niiiin case to attempt by inti-
</p>
<p>midation and the demonstration of physical power
</p>
<p>to overawe the council.-! of the nation. Those bands
</p>
<p>are a little thing in consideration of the case, and
</p>
<p>are not of great weight. They may in some measure
</p>
<p>relate to the question of organization and discipline,
</p>
<p>something eontributary more or less to the existence
</p>
<p>of physical force, but the striking feature in the
</p>
<p>meetings is, the immense masses in which the people
</p>
<p>were collected, and the nature and the audience of
</p>
<p>the speeches that were made for the assembled
</p>
<p>multitudes upon those occasions. Generally those
</p>
<p>speeches were made by Mr. Daniel O'Connell, but he
</p>
<p>was not alone or singular in being the person who
</p>
<p>addressed the multitudes. There are other persons
</p>
<p>also included now amongst the traversers, who
</p>
<p>availed themselves of the opportiinity of displaying
</p>
<p>themselves and making their sentiments known to
</p>
<p>theassembled multitudes. You will say, gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, from the nature of those speeches, were
</p>
<p>they acting in pursuance or promotion of a common
</p>
<p>design, and that a criminal one ; it will be for you
</p>
<p>to judge. From a few of the speeches 1 shall take
</p>
<p>the liberty of selecting some passages for your con-
</p>
<p>sideration. The first of those is the one of the 13th
</p>
<p>of May, at Mullingar ; that was attended by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell and by Sir. Barrett; I believe also by
</p>
<p>another traverser, but I am not sure of that, there-
</p>
<p>fore do not t.ake it down ; I may have misconceived,
</p>
<p>but at all events by those two gentlemen I have
</p>
<p>named to you. Now that assembly was composed
</p>
<p>of multitudes of persons .amounting to hundreds of
</p>
<p>thousands, brought together from various quarters,
</p>
<p>preceded by bands and banners ; and to them Mr.

</p>
<p>ship read an extract of tlie speech at Longford, iu
</p>
<p>reference to Lord Beanmont, and in which reference
</p>
<p>is made to tlie story of Ellen O'Moore.] You re-
</p>
<p>cellect, one or more of the counts in this indictment
</p>
<p>accused the traversers of endeavouring to excite
</p>
<p>hatred and discontent amongst her Majesty's sub-
</p>
<p>jects, particularly the Irish people against the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish. There is the first instance that I have read to
</p>
<p>you  a defined and specified instance  which must
</p>
<p>go directly, if at all, and if believed, in support of
</p>
<p>that charge. It is for you to say, gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>jury, whether you think that is a part of free dis-
</p>
<p>cussion; whether you think that is a fair and legiti-
</p>
<p>mate mode of bringing to bear the weight of popular
</p>
<p>opinion iu favour of a change of political questions;
</p>
<p>or is it, as laid in the indictment, a part of a system,
</p>
<p>in which two or more combined, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of raising hatred and disatfection and discontent
</p>
<p>amongst one class of her Majesty's subjects against
</p>
<p>another? What was the ruin of Ireland contem-
</p>
<p>plated in this speech ? Something existing in the
</p>
<p>imagination of Mr. O'Connell, who framed and
</p>
<p>fabricated this story for the purpose of having its
</p>
<p>effect. No such story as this kind ever e::;3teil ; but
</p>
<p>it was a supposition, a kind of novel invented by
</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell on the occasion :* and for what pur-
</p>
<p>pose? To have free discussion upon the subject of
</p>
<p>the union ? or to have the passions of one part of
</p>
<p>the country excited against another, and deeds of
</p>
<p>.violence provoked by the introduction of an vin-
</p>
<p>founded false story of that nature ? He said  " No,
</p>
<p>one blaze of powerful fire would reach through her
</p>
<p>vast extent, and in the destruction of England,
</p>
<p>would vindicate the country of the maddened and

</p>
<p>persecuted Irishman who would have reached her
</p>
<p>shores (cheers)." That is the way in which a story
</p>
<p>of that nature is received by the multitudes of
</p>
<p>Longford. Is that a singular instance of the means
</p>
<p>that were resorted to at those great monster meet-
</p>
<p>ings, for the purgose of producing and procuring
</p>
<p>those ends, which the persons had in view who
</p>
<p>caused them to assemble ? Now I am going to read
</p>
<p>another passage ; you will judge whether it be or be
</p>
<p>not of a piece with what >ou have heard before.
</p>
<p>On the 14th of June, 1843, there is the Freeman's
</p>
<p>Journal (this is Dr. Gray's paper), and the paper I
</p>
<p>have in my hand was read in the progress of the
</p>
<p>trial by Mr. Fitzgibbou, as counsel for Dr. Gray.
</p>
<p>Dr. Gray, iu his paper of the 14th of June, has
</p>
<p>thought proper to publish a speech of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell's, as given at a dinner at Mallow, which had
</p>
<p>taken place about two days before. [Here his lord-
</p>
<p>ship read a short extract from the speech of Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell at the dinner after the Mallow meeting.]
</p>
<p>Now, the word " enemy" occurs very often in many
</p>
<p>of the speeches made by Mr. O'Connell, either iu
</p>
<p>the presence of the other traversers or otherwise ;
</p>
<p>made also by other persons amongst the traversers
</p>
<p>in their respective speeches. Whether it be the
</p>
<p>word "enemy," or whether it be the contemptuous
</p>
<p>word "Saxon," it will he for you to say to whom is
</p>
<p>that designation attached ? Can it have a meaning
</p>
<p>of any other description than that of English ? That
</p>
<p>is for you to say. " I think I perceive a fixed dis-
</p>
<p>position on the part of some of our Saxon traducers
</p>
<p>to put us to the test." Now it is true, as I before
</p>
<p>observed, that net only at the association, but also
</p>
<p>I believe without exception at all those public meet-
</p>
<p>THE CHARGE OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.

<p>463
</p>
<p>took place two hundred years ago ? Tor wliat pur-
</p>
<p>pose is that introduced? Is that, gentlemen, ask
</p>
<p>yourselves, for the purpose of free discussion upon
</p>
<p>a political question, or is it for the purpose of excit-
</p>
<p>ing by those details, whether true or false, the ani-
</p>
<p>mosity or hatred of the Irish against the English ?
</p>
<p>" I am not at all imaginative when I talk of tliis,
</p>
<p>but yet I assert that there would be no danger of
</p>
<p>the women now ; for the men of Ireland would die
</p>
<p>to tlie last in their defence. (Here the whole com-
</p>
<p>pany rose and cheered for several minutes.) We
</p>
<p>were a paltry remnant then  we are nine milUons
</p>
<p>nOw." That is not the only place, or the only
</p>
<p>occasion, where the assembled multitudes were
</p>
<p>treated with stories of such horrors and such pro-
</p>
<p>fanations committed by the Englisli against the
</p>
<p>Irish. Amongst other very remarkable meetings
</p>
<p>wliich were held under the auspices of Mr. O'Con-
</p>
<p>nell, and those who go with him, was a great meet-
</p>
<p>ing which was held at Tara, in the county of Meath,
</p>
<p>on the 15th of August last  a place of particular
</p>
<p>veneration. It is a spot reliyione sacer, and selected
</p>
<p>upon that account, and the history connected with
</p>
<p>it. Captain Despard, wlio attended that meeting,
</p>
<p>a stipendiary magistrate, supposed tlie number of
</p>
<p>persons assembled there to have been three hundred
</p>
<p>thousand. At the association, Mr. O'Connell. and
</p>
<p>those in tlie interest of the association, described it
</p>
<p>as infinitelj' greater, amounting, according to some,
</p>
<p>to a million persons ; according to others, and I be-
</p>
<p>lieve Mr. O'Connell himself, to a million and a half.
</p>
<p>The people so assembled were addressed by Mr.

</p>
<p>meetings  Epotaque flumina Medo prandmte  and the
</p>
<p>conviviality of the evening was enlivened by a speech
</p>
<p>of Mr. U'Connell's. Gentlemen of the jury, there
</p>
<p>is the same horrible story of the most astonishing
</p>
<p>barbarity and cruelty, repeated again, after a
</p>
<p>Considerable interval of time, in another place,
</p>
<p>to another assembly ; and thousands and hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of thousands are again excited by the same
</p>
<p>detail of Britisli cruelty, British barbarity, com-
</p>
<p>mitted two hundred years ago, with an intimation
</p>
<p>that such scenes might occur again. " From that
</p>
<p>day, when the barbarian Saxon delighted his assas-

<p>sin soldiers by the slow process of individual mur-
</p>
<p>der, until the three hundred females were, one after
</p>
<p>the other, stabbed and massacred. Even Tara liill
</p>
<p>is stained with modern blood, and the hones are not
</p>
<p>mouldered yet of the individuals who were massa-
</p>
<p>cred in hundreds upon it." What that alludes to I
</p>
<p>cannot tell.* " If such another force were brought
</p>
<p>from England now  if it were announced to the
</p>
<p>people that some paltry Orangemen were armed, and
</p>
<p>that foreign soldiers were brought over to butcher,
</p>
<p>to slaughter, to dishonour ; oh ! tell the people that,
</p>
<p>and see whether they have melted away like the
</p>
<p>snow (hear, hear, and tremendous cheers)." Gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen of the jury, it appeai-s to have been his con-
</p>
<p>stant practice at most, if not all of those meetings,
</p>
<p>to invite the assembled people to obey his call, to
</p>
<p>be ready and assemble again whenever he might
</p>
<p>think proper to call for them. They would be found
</p>
<p>to come together again, inspired, no doubt, by the
</p>
<p>tales of horror and cruelty and barbarity which he
</p>
<p>had detailed as having taken place by the ruffian
</p>
<p>soldiers of Great Britain, and of which he more than

</p>
<p>proof of lioir much physical power may be concen-
</p>
<p>trated with perfect safety to life and property, and
</p>
<p>even without tendency to insult and injury. I have
</p>
<p>gained tliat step, and I defy the British ministry to
</p>
<p>take it from me. I have demonstrated that I have
</p>
<p>more men, more men of a fighting age  why should
</p>
<p>I not use that word ?  ready to stand by their coun-
</p>
<p>try, than ever evinced that determination before."
</p>
<p>Has that a bearing, gentlemen, on the question whe-
</p>
<p>ther these speeches were made to these assembled
</p>
<p>multitudes for the purpose of intimidation, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of overawing the legislature, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of letting the ministers hear of  not his arguments,
</p>
<p>his peaceable arguments on behalf of free discussion,
</p>
<p>but his statements of the power he held in his hands ?
</p>
<p>' I say to England, we will use no violence, we will
</p>
<p>make no attack, we will reserve our force for defence,
</p>
<p>but attack us if you dare  (cheers)." The speecli
</p>
<p>went on to speak of the arbitration courts. " We will
</p>
<p>appoint arbitrators for everything the people may
</p>
<p>choose." We will appoint arbiti'ators. " And I
</p>
<p>trust before I am twelve months older to take half
</p>
<p>the business out of the superior courts. Tiiis is
</p>
<p>laying the basis of a judicial system." What is the
</p>
<p>law upon thesubject? Whoever interferes witli the
</p>
<p>Queen's prerogative, judicial or otherwise, is guilty
</p>
<p>of an high misdemeanour. " I defy all the crown
</p>
<p>lawyers to find a flaw in the plan." It is not neces-
</p>
<p>sary for me to discuss the law with Mr. O'Connell ;
</p>
<p>but that is not the way I put the law to you. Now
</p>
<p>here is a further proof of what he and his multitudes
</p>
<p>are doing, independent of the crown, independent
</p>
<p>of the legislature. " He had made arrangements to

<p>find out what parts of Ireland should be entitled to
</p>
<p>return members of parliament, and having ascer-
</p>
<p>tained that, he would next have distinct repeal war-
</p>
<p>dens who should be called returning officei's, ready
</p>
<p>to act. The result would be, that three hundred
</p>
<p>gentlemen, from the several cities and counties of
</p>
<p>Ireland, would assemble in Dublin, and they would
</p>
<p>have the frame^work of an Irish parliament com-
</p>
<p>plete. The mere form of attaching a bit of wax to a
</p>
<p>piece of parchment being all that would be required
</p>
<p>to render it all that they wanted." He and the
</p>
<p>Queen, I suppose, going in concert together for the
</p>
<p>violation of her coronation oath. " Thus he was
</p>
<p>prepared to play the game to the last with the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish government. Thus he hoped to checkmate
</p>
<p>them, but in doing so it might be necessary for him
</p>
<p>to go slowly." He kept quiet in the mean time 
</p>
<p>" And if so, neither the scoffs of an enemy, nor the
</p>
<p>taunts of a pretended friend, would induce him to
</p>
<p>go faster (hear, hear). AVithout going into the
</p>
<p>convention act, or any other act, he said they would
</p>
<p>have, as he had stated, three hundred gentlemen
</p>
<p>meeting together in Dublin to discuss the state and
</p>
<p>prospects of Ireland, and that society might easily
</p>

<p>of the Irish people, and the extraordinary resources

<p>and power which they would hold in their hands

</p>
<p>copy of the yellow pl.acard, and nobody can doubt,
</p>
<p>who has heard theevidence in this case, but that this
</p>
<p>meeting at Mullaghmast was one of a most delihc-
</p>
<p>rate character. "Leinster for repeal. Men of Lein-
</p>
<p>ster, to MiiUaghmast. The province will declare
</p>
<p>fqr repeal." They will declare for it ; not they will
</p>
<p>petition for it. " They will declare for repeal on ihe

<p>go through Kilcullen, Colverlstown, and the long

<p>avenue to MuUnglmiast. The bands and horsemen

<p>to muster at Kilcullen." There is something of mi-
</p>
<p>litary diction in that. " Once more, men of Lein-
</p>

</p>
<p>ber, 1843. Browne, printer, 36, Nass.au-street."

<p>That is not equivojal. There did assemble there
</p>
<p>thousands upon thousands, eqval in point of num-
</p>
<p>bers to the vastiide of persons that assembled in
</p>
<p>and upon the hill of Tara  overwhelming multi-
</p>
<p>tudes. They came there, as the placard announces,
</p>
<p>attended by bands, and the cav.alry mustered, I ) re-
</p>
<p>sume, at the pl.ace appointed. They began to as-
</p>
<p>Bemlile .it an early hour in the morning, because
</p>
<p>millions or thousands upon thousands cannot be
</p>
<p>brought together in a moment; and it took a long
</p>
<p>time to bring together such an extraordinary demon-
</p>
<p>stration of physical force. Recollect the character
</p>
<p>of those forces given l>y Mr. OC^onnell at the Clif-
</p>
<p>den meeting a few weeks before. They came at-
</p>
<p>tended by b.auds and banners, a great number of
</p>
<p>which had inscriptions upi n them. Karly in tlie
</p>
<p>morning there was circulated, at MuUaghmast. a
</p>
<p>particular publication having a direct reference to
</p>
<p>the subject, for it called u]on the people to remem-
</p>
<p>ber "MulLaghniast. Now you will observe, gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the jury, that this paper is proved to have been
</p>
<p>circulated to llie amount of ihousands, at least two
</p>
<p>thousand, .iliout the Uath, or wherever it was the
</p>
<p>meeting was assembled. It is in proof that the
</p>
<p>multitudes who came from Dublin, many of them,
</p>
<p>hundreds of them, came with wands, and repeal
</p>
<p>tickets stuck in their hats, withadesignalion marked
</p>
<p>" O'Connell's police ;" and you have heai-d a great
</p>
<p>deal of tilt power and cfBcaey of that police in the
</p>
<p>preservation of peace and good order; that is to
</p>
<p>say, that peace which consists in the absence of riot
</p>
<p>or disturbance, but how far it consists in the absence
</p>
<p>of what is criminal is another question. These pa-
</p>
<p>pers, giving a description of MuUaghmast, were in

</p>
<p>tiling; tlie murclorecl people were Catholics, to be
</p>
<p>sure, but tliere were a great number of the mur-
</p>
<p>derers also Catholics; because there vrere traitors
</p>
<p>then to Ireland, and there are some Catholics of the
</p>
<p>same kind existing now; but we have now tliis ad-
</p>
<p>vantacie, we have many honest Protc stants joining
</p>
<p>lis, in hand and in heart, for old Ireland and liberty."
</p>
<p>Is that, or is that not, in unison with ilie printed
</p>
<p>paper circulated over the Kalh of MuUauhmast in
</p>
<p>the morning which I read? "Oh! my friends, I
</p>
<p>will kiep you clear of all treachery ; there shall be
</p>
<p>no bargain, no compromise, nothinj; but the repeal
</p>
<p>and a parliament of onr own in College-green. 1
</p>
<p>liave swelle 1 the multitude of repealers, till they are
</p>
<p>identified with the entire populalicm of the soil, or
</p>
<p>nearly so." Is that, or is it not, a display and a
</p>
<p>l)oast of pliysical force ? "I have seven-eighths of
</p>
<p>the populaticni of Ireland enrolling themselves as
</p>
<p>associates (cries of ' More power to you"). I don't
</p>
<p>want more power; I have power enough. All I ask
</p>
<p>of you is, to allow me to use it. I will go on quietly
</p>
<p>and slowly." Then he turns to another subject 
</p>
<p>" I am arrfinging the plan of a new Ir sh house of
</p>
<p>commons. It is a theory ; but it is a theory that
</p>
<p>may be realized in three weeks ' How was that to
</p>
<p>be accomplished ? What m.achinery was to be re-
</p>
<p>sorted to to bring abont the estnblishment of a new
</p>
<p>house of commons for Ireland in three weeks? Was
</p>
<p>that to be done by physical force, or was it to be
</p>
<p>done otherwise? "The arbitrators are beginning
</p>
<p>to sit; the people are submitting their diifcrences
</p>
<p>to men chosen by themselves. You will see by the
</p>
<p>newspapers, that Dr. Gray and my son, and other

<p>gentlemen, held a petty session of their own. It

</p>
<p>cost the people nothing. We will have chosen men
</p>
<p>of our own, in the room of magistrates whom they
</p>
<p>have unjustly deprived." That is the reason that
</p>
<p>he gives for the establishment of arbitraticm courts ;
</p>
<p>not with any view of preventing the practice of ad-
</p>
<p>ministering oaths, not with any view of assimilating
</p>
<p>themselves to the peaceable practice of the Quakers ;
</p>
<p>not with any view to assimilate themselves to the
</p>
<p>established practice of the Ouzel Galley in Dublin,
</p>
<p>which acts under process derived from the superior
</p>
<p>courts ; but the object was to put into these arbi-
</p>
<p>tration courts the magistrates who were dismissed
</p>
<p>by the government for attending rcjieal meetings.
</p>
<p>' I shall go on with this i)lan." Now at Connemara
</p>
<p>he said, that " in laying this plan for the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of arbitration courts, he was laying the foun-
</p>
<p>dation of a new judicial system for courts of justice."
</p>
<p>'I shall go on with this plan until I have all dis-
</p>
<p>putes decided by judges appointed by the people
</p>
<p>themselves. I wish to live long enough to see justice
</p>
<p>realized in Ireland, and liberty proclaimed through-
</p>
<p>out the land." Is that, or is it not, in other words,
</p>
<p>saying that justice is not administered by the courts
</p>
<p>of law now in Ireland ? Is it, or is it not, a decla-
</p>
<p>ration made for the purpose of bringmg into disre-
</p>
<p>pute the courts of law existing in Ireland, and the
</p>
<p>ad ninistration of justice in them? " It will take

<p>me"  take nie  " some time to arrange the state of

</p>
<p>but we must have Ireland for the Irish. I won't be

<p>content until I see not a single man in any office,

<p>exact trick cannot abvnys be playetl twico. A set nf
</p>
<p>chieftains may not always bs inveigled by the go-
</p>
<p>Ternnient; the times may alter, but tlie spirit nf
</p>
<p>England is the sams. whether it is manifested in the
</p>
<p>breaking of the solemn pledge of hospitality, or the
</p>
<p>solemn pledge of political justice." That, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, was Mr. Barrett's part in the drama so carried
</p>
<p>on at MuUaghmast. Mr. Daniel O'Connell made a
</p>
<p>speech also at t!ie dinner or banquet nt Mullaghmast.
</p>
<p>You are to juige whether it is diiferciit from the
</p>
<p>tone anil manner of his previous address to the as-
</p>
<p>sembled multitudes. "Gentlem'jn, tliis was and is
</p>
<p>to me a m )St delightful day  a day full of conn)la- I
</p>
<p>lion, because baaining with hope  a day full of de- i
</p>
<p>light, because contradictory of the anticipations of |
</p>
<p>our enemies. Oh ! how glad I am that we deter- i
</p>
<p>mined to meet at Mullaghmast ! They declared
</p>
<p>that the people would become indifferent, and that
</p>
<p>in apathy and in silence our efforts for the regenera-
</p>
<p>tion of Ireland would terminate. Mullaghmast is
</p>
<p>my answer." That is, the .assembly he had collected
</p>
<p>there. "At first you remember, they threatened
</p>
<p>us with war. Peel was valiant for his hour, and
</p>
<p>the Duke of Wellington, of course, who was caught
</p>
<p>napping at Waterloo one fine morning  the Duke
</p>
<p>of W'eliiugton declared tliere was nothing for it but
</p>
<p>w.ar ; we replied in a tone of firm defiance, and the
</p>
<p>threat of war vanished, as they say the exertions
</p>
<p>for repeal would vanish. Kvery man is as convinced
</p>
<p>as I am of two things; first, that repeal can be ob-
</p>
<p>tained ; secondly, that the only way to attain it is,
</p>
<p>the peaceful uprising of the masses, and swelling
</p>
<p>above all the pitiful, and paltry, and minor difficulties
</p>
<p>that are in the way." The peaceful uprising of the

</p>
<p>ease, lean sleep to-night tranquilly, and perhaps

<p>dream of Ireland ; I will awake thinking of the next

<p>step in the \)rogress of her freedom, and those steps

<p>are notdiSieult. The administration of the law"
</p>
<p>that is, in the courts of justice; now mind this,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, it relates to one of tlie objects of the im-
</p>
<p>puted conspiracy  " the administration of the law
</p>
<p>we want to get out of the liands of the enemy; the
</p>
<p>arbitration courts are working well, and there are
</p>
<p>already judges selected by themselves. It is not by
</p>
<p>accident"  (and here he recurs to the same defama-
</p>
<p>tory matter again)^"it is not by accident, that
</p>
<p>to-night we are on the Uath of Mullaghmast ; it was
</p>
<p>deliberate design. Where my voice is sounding,
</p>
<p>and you are quiet hearers attentively listening, tliere
</p>
<p>was once raised the yell of despair, the groans of
</p>
<p>approaching death, the agony of inflicted wounds
</p>
<p>on the perishing and the unarmed ; in this very spot
</p>
<p>they fell beneath the swords of the Saxon, who used
</p>
<p>them securely and delightfully, in grinding their
</p>
<p>victims to death. Hire the Saxon raised a shout
</p>
<p>of victory over his unarm<'d prey ; upon this very
</p>
<p>spot three hundred able men perished, who, confid-
</p>
<p>ing in Saxon promises, came to a conference of the
</p>
<p>(Queen's subjects, and in the merriment of the ban-

<p>quet they were slaughtered." Is not that the very

<p>story that w-as circulated round the liath of Mul-

<p>how it does delight my heart to think yuu dare not

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>largin^ tlie francliise and increasing the constituency
</p>
<p>i.i Ireland, they hope to detach us from ihe great
</p>
<p>and paramount consideration of this question. Tliey
</p>
<p>miffht concede all these, and even more. Most
</p>
<p>like'y they would tempt the I.iherator with fine
</p>
<p>promises, in addition to some good acts ; but he was
</p>
<p>too wise for tliem  he was never yet over-reached
</p>
<p>by an English government  he has always been the
</p>
<p>watchful, wary, and undeceived advocate of his
</p>
<p>country's wrongs, and we may safely leave him to
</p>
<p>take everything that they give; but as .soon as he
</p>
<p>gets all, never was the steam of repeal up till then."
</p>
<p>That is the character of Mr. O'Connell given by
</p>
<p>his friend, the Rev. Mr. Kearney, who appears lo
</p>
<p>liave introduced him with those sentiments, and that
</p>
<p>description in the way of eulogy. " Allow me then,
</p>
<p>not lo take up your time any longer, to read the
</p>
<p>resolution." Now did Mr. O'Connell deny that,
</p>
<p>when he came to speak? Did he dissent or differ
</p>
<p>from that? Did he say that would be professing
</p>
<p>one thing, and acting upon another ; that that would
</p>
<p>te base and disingenuous; that he rejected .ind re-
</p>
<p>pudiated it? Nothing of the sort. Here is what
</p>
<p>he said about it ; this is from Mr. O'Connell's speech.
</p>
<p>" When I addressed former meetings, 1 told them
</p>
<p>to join me, and all would soon be right ; but now I
</p>
<p>tell you that it is all right, the nnil i5 in the hole 
</p>
<p>(a voice, "drive it home")  aye, drive it home, and
</p>
<p>I will clench it on the other side. I am quite ready
</p>
<p>to respect the vested rights of persons at present in
</p>
<p>possession, but though I am content. 1 see from what
</p>
<p>fell from my fncnd Mr. Kobinson, that it is not safe
</p>
<p>.for the parsons to delay in joining with us to have
</p>
<p>an adjustment of church property. We will take

</p>
<p>anything we get now, but if they delay, we will
</p>
<p>take the whole; we will have egg, shell, and all."
</p>
<p>,And he concludes that speech thus:  "I claim the
</p>
<p>highest meed of praise fbr Irishmen. Oh 1 little the
</p>
<p>Saxon knows that gentleness of manners that arises
</p>
<p>under religious enthusiasm, that forbearance that

<p>springs from the religious principle de;;ply impressed

<p>it is that very religious forbearance that makes you

<p>.be no treachery among you, and it is treachery to

<p>vote for any one but a repealer. I have lieard of
</p>
<p>8ome parish in this county where some repealers
</p>
<p>voted for a Tory ; however, we will say no more
</p>
<p>about it at present, but now I give command, never
</p>
<p>to vote for any Tory, nor for any one else but a re-
</p>
<p>pealer. Let every one join with me in the call for
</p>
<p>repeal, and the shout"  not the free discussion

<p>aroused from his slumber, the echo will be borne on

<p>repealed." Gentlemen, the ne.xt speech made by
</p>
<p>one of these gentUmen who are accus-ed of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy at that meeting at Mullaghma.<t, was by Mr.

<p>the truth, what were the real intentions of the
</p>
<p>several parties that are aocuseil before you of having
</p>
<p>entered into this alleijorl cunspiracy and common
</p>
<p>design. The general objects of lliat meeting have
</p>
<p>leeu brought befure your minds, as furnishing more
</p>
<p>or less evidence of ttiis general design, entertained
</p>
<p>and inculcated by the principal speakers upon tliat
</p>
<p>occasion ; evidence of exciting discontent, hatred,
</p>
<p>and animosity in the iieople of Ireland against the
</p>
<p>people of England for by-gone scenes and offence?,
</p>
<p>the truth of which cannot be ascertained, but which,
</p>
<p>if ever they did exist, were (to say the least of it,)
</p>
<p>now gratuitously brought before the public mind,
</p>
<p>and tlie consideration of this assembled multitude.
</p>
<p>Now there was present, who took an active part in
</p>
<p>thac meeting, Mr. O'Connell senior, wlio made two
</p>
<p>speeches  Mr. O'Connell senior, who was the per-
</p>
<p>son who gave his orders for the procuring of that
</p>
<p>assembly  Mr. O'Ccmnell senior, who selected that
</p>
<p>place because it was the scene of that former alleged
</p>
<p>bloody massacre, perpetrated two hundred and fifty
</p>
<p>years ago by the Englisli of that day against the
</p>
<p>Irish of that time, to revive and to bring to light
</p>
<p>again, the feelings which must have dwelt in the
</p>
<p>hearts and minds of those at that time connected
</p>
<p>with the sufferers in that tragedy. You recollect
</p>
<p>how he has described it, hoiv he has painted tlic
</p>
<p>scenes of misery and wretchedness, which must have
</p>
<p>seized upon and overwhelmed the feelings of every
</p>
<p>person who wasconnected with those who perished.
</p>
<p>It was not for nothing, he said, he brought them to
</p>
<p>that place, and he makes that speech, standing (as
</p>
<p>he says,) upon the spot where the tragedy was com-
</p>
<p>mitted where every thing that Ireland at that time

<p>ought to haveheld dear was sacrificed to the cruelty
</p>
<p>and treachery of the government of the country at
</p>
<p>that time. It was to revive and to recal the feelings
</p>
<p>that he described as existing in the heiirts of those
</p>
<p>relatives, and to infase the same into the breasts of
</p>
<p>those, of the present <lay, who were listening to the
</p>
<p>eloquent way in which he pourtrayed those horrible
</p>
<p>scenes. What is the accusation fourdjd upon it?
</p>
<p>'J'iie accusation is for endeavouring to excite and to
</p>
<p>raise discontent and disaffection in one part of her
</p>
<p>Majesty's subjects against the other, especially the
</p>
<p>Irish against the English. ])oes this, or does it not
</p>
<p>support that charge? That is for yon to say. They
</p>
<p>say that all this takes place for the purpose of pro-
</p>
<p>moting free discussion, and fair and candid inquiry
</p>
<p>as to the prudence of repealing the union. But is
</p>
<p>that the only ground on which this transaction bears
</p>
<p>upon the present case? That assembly, so met,
</p>
<p>consisted of as many men, as many persons, as were
</p>
<p>assembled upon the hill of Tara  the greatest mon-
</p>
<p>ster meeting that up to that time had ever taken
</p>
<p>place in Ireland ; were those thousands to have
</p>
<p>their feelings excited, and were the British ministry
</p>
<p>to be told  were the British parli.ament to be told,
</p>
<p>that those hundreds of thousands of people, organ-
</p>
<p>ised and disciplined, excited in the manner that you
</p>
<p>have heard stated by the parties themselves, existed
</p>
<p>in the country in such a state of misery, that the
</p>
<p>moment Mr. O'Connell thought proper to stamp his
</p>
<p>foot, or to raise his hand, those multitudes would re-
</p>
<p>assemble, no matter what his command niinhtbe?
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, doi's that go to support their alle-
</p>
<p>gation that this is free discussion ; or does it go to
</p>
<p>support, or is it evidence to supiMU't, the imputation

</p>
<p>two months before that meeting. I do not menri to
</p>
<p>impute iinything to Mr. M'Caiin, but it diil appear
</p>
<p>that Mr. M'Cann. in tlie discliarge nf his duty as
</p>
<p>constable, with reference to what niiglit take plnee
</p>
<p>between him and Mr. Tierney, did certainly at first
</p>
<p>conceive that lie ought to have kept a diary or
</p>
<p>journal, and that he did at one time write a journal
</p>
<p>of what took place, but that journal is not forth-
</p>
<p>coming; .and, therefore, gentlemen of the jury, I
</p>
<p>think there is ablot upon that man's testimony, and
</p>
<p>I should he unwilling to call your attention, under
</p>
<p>the circumstances, to his evidence against the tra-
</p>
<p>verser. I am confining myself now to the meeting
</p>
<p>at Clontibret. There is no question as to wh.at pass;d
</p>
<p>afterwards with regard to Mr. Tierney ; and I am
</p>
<p>the more disposed to take that course with respect
</p>
<p>to Mr. Tierney, at Clontibret, because he appears to
</p>
<p>be a gentleman who had conducted himself in the
</p>
<p>country with tlie propriet.v nnil correctness, which
</p>
<p>one hopes, and which one might e.xpect, to n.cet with
</p>
<p>from a gentleman of his cloth. The policeman was
</p>
<p>the only person who was examined, and ho .idniitted,
</p>
<p>upon his cross-examination, thegener.al high estiin.a-
</p>
<p>tion in which Mr. Tierney was personallylield, and
</p>
<p>he added, th.at in the discharge of his duty ivs police-
</p>
<p>man, lie had more than once received assistance from
</p>
<p>him. That is creditable to him. But now, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, suppose we impute nothing to him for the
</p>
<p>transaction of the 15th of August. What, then,
</p>
<p>took place on the 3d of October ?  and this is worth
</p>
<p>your consideration. Mr. Tierney attended at the
</p>
<p>repeal association, on Monday, the 3d of October ;
</p>
<p>that was the day but one after that great meeting
</p>
<p>at Mullaghmast, at which those resolutions Here

<p>entered into to which I have called your attention.
</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Tierney knew, or did not know, of the
</p>
<p>existence, or particulars, or nature of those proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, 1 do not exclude from your consideration ; he
</p>
<p>certainly might have known them, and the fact was
</p>
<p>60 recent, and the place so near, that it will be for
</p>
<p>you to say whether he could have avoided knowing
</p>
<p>them  not neat where he lives, but near where he
</p>
<p>was on the Monday following, in the city of Dublin ;
</p>
<p>it was the very day afterwards, or the day but one
</p>
<p>I think, Mr. Tierney came to a meeiing of the .asso-
</p>
<p>ciation, and Mr. Tierney then and there made a
</p>
<p>speech ; it will be for you to say, and to judge, of
</p>
<p>the character and nature of that speech. He is
</p>
<p>charged with conspiracy, and you will lake it into
</p>
<p>your consideration, how far or otherwise the o'-'jccts
</p>
<p>of that speech fall in with and partake of the
</p>
<p>general nature of the common design. The Reve-

</p>
<p>think this very highly respectable clergyman de-

<p>might commit, one only he has omitted, and that is

<p>than this contribution from the neighbourhood of

<p>was carried accordingly. He then entered the as-

<p>with him ? Was or was not his speech then deli-

<p>vered, a speech for the purpose of making a public
</p>
<p>communication of the treachery, and cruelty, and
</p>
<p>barbarity of England, between two and three hun-

<p>dred years ago? Is that, or is it not, in unison

<p>Mullaghmast? Is it or is it not in unison, and

<p>tending to the same end, with the detail of the mur-

<p>ders committed by the same persons, but detailed
</p>
<p>in the language of Mr. Barrett? Is it or is it not
</p>
<p>with a community of purpose, in furtherance of the

<p>same end and design as the story told of the three

<p>peated at the meeting at Mallow, the same facts,

<p>though expressed perhaps in different language?

<p>Do you see here anything of community of purpose

<p>or design? It is for you, gentlemen, to say, whe-

<p>ther under those circumstances, you think the Rev.

<p>Mr. Tierney is a participator in this common de-
</p>
<p>sign, and whether he has embraced that association,

<p>and undertaken to carry out the same designs by

<p>the same means. Now, gentlemen, I have gone

<p>took place at Mullaghmast, and at the association
</p>
<p>meeting two days afterwards, I have more or less in
</p>
<p>my observations included and touched upon all the
</p>
<p>traversers, Mr. Duffy excepted. It is not denied
</p>
<p>that Mr. Duffy was a member of the association ; it

</p>
<p>meetings have been held, and no Mngle event has
</p>
<p>occurred to funiisli the wiirst iidnister with an .ex-
</p>
<p>cuse for preventing their repetition. The slopping
</p>
<p>of them might hazard public jieace  not on the in-
</p>
<p>stant, for the |ieople know their jiolicy too well for

<p>that ; but such oppression might ultimately produce

<p>to other tribunals tlinn those courts. Now, it may
</p>
<p>be, gentlemen of the jury, that one and all of these
</p>
<p>several charges of criminnlity may, in your appre-
</p>
<p>hension, have been brought home in evidence
</p>
<p>against the several traversers, one and all of them,
</p>
<p>or against such of them as you may be of opinion
</p>
<p>the common criminal design is proved against ;
</p>
<p>bearing, however, in mind, that no conspiracy is
</p>
<p>proved into which more than one does not enter.
</p>
<p>Before, however, I put tlie case finally to you, I
</p>
<p>have another document yet to read, which 1 think
</p>
<p>is of too much importance to be omitted; and I have
</p>
<p>something to say in conclusion with regard to the
</p>
<p>particular charge in the indictment as to the erec-
</p>
<p>tion of the arbitration courts, with a view to dispa-
</p>
<p>rage and to bring into disrepute the established tri-
</p>
<p>bunals of the country. The document to which I
</p>
<p>refer was issued by the association on the 13th of
</p>
<p>September, 1813. It |n'ofesses to be " An address
</p>
<p>from the loyal national repeal association of Ireland
</p>
<p>to the inhabitants of the countries subject to the
</p>
<p>British crown.'' It is not an address to the crown.
</p>
<p>It is not an address to the commons  it is not a pe-

<p>body, the constitution and nature of which you are

<p>labours  yet have no other hope, as far as you are
</p>
<p>concerned, than that of vindicating themselves in
</p>
<p>the eyes of alt rational and just men amongst you
</p>
<p>for the magnitude of the struggle they are now
</p>
<p>making in the cause of their country. There is no
</p>
<p>truth more undeniable than this, that England has
</p>
<p>inflicted more grievous calamities upon Ireland than
</p>
<p>any country on the face of the earth besides has
</p>
<p>done upon any other." Is this a publication, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, with a view or intention of inflaming the
</p>
<p>people of Ireland, and exciting discontent and
</p>
<p>hatred against the people of England, or is it dojie
</p>
<p>Avith any other design? "In the history of man.
</p>
<p>kind there is nothing to be compared with the
</p>
<p>atrocity of the crimes which England has perpe-
</p>
<p>trated on the Irish people, nor as yet has the spirit
</p>
<p>which created and animated such crimes been much
</p>
<p>mitigated, if mitigate 1 at all from its original viru-
</p>
<p>lence. The consummation of such crimes, up to the
</p>
<p>close of the last century, is to be found in the atro-
</p>
<p>cious manner in which the legislative union between
</p>
<p>both countries was effected." U then goes on with
</p>
<p>a recapitulation of what you before heard, of what
</p>
<p>they state to be their grievances, as resulting out of
</p>
<p>the act of union, and the manner in which they al-
</p>
<p>ledged that act of parliament was carried. And it
</p>
<p>proceeds thus:  " Seventhly  An anti-Catholic and
</p>
<p>finti-Irish spirit governs the distribution of official
</p>
<p>situations, and has been most painfully exhibited in
</p>
<p>t!ie great majority of official appointments made by
</p>
<p>the present ministry." Now mind the dispai-age-
</p>
<p>raent it throws on the courts of justice. "Kighthly

</p>
<p>tail J I mran the arbitration courts. You will ob-
</p>
<p>eerve, genllemen of the jury, that the charge is not
</p>
<p>simply for combining together to erect and consti-
</p>
<p>tute these arbitration courts, but the main and
</p>
<p>principal part of tlie charge is tliis  combining toge-
</p>
<p>ther for tlie purpose of bringing into disrepute and
</p>
<p>discredit the existing courts of justice in the country,
</p>
<p>as by law establislied. There was a great deal of
</p>
<p>argument, and a good deal I think of unnecessary
</p>
<p>statement with regard to the subject of arbitration.
</p>
<p>It was said witli a great deal of veliemence, and
</p>
<p>sincerity, I have no doubt, tliat the termination of
</p>
<p>suits by arbitration nas not only no crime, but lauda-
</p>
<p>ble as a religious and a moral duty ; and it was said
</p>
<p>to be the universal practice of the Society of Friends
</p>
<p>or Quakers, who, it was stated, .ind most deserv-
</p>
<p>edly, were amongst the most moral and properly
</p>
<p>conducted subjects that belong to tlie Brilisli crown.
</p>
<p>By the rule of the Society of Friends, any member
</p>
<p>who had a dispute with another person, was bound,
</p>
<p>in the first instance, to endeavour to have tliat ques-
</p>
<p>tion decided by arbitration, before he w.-is at liberty
</p>
<p>to Uike proceedings at law ; and, moreover, that
</p>
<p>rnle of the society was enforced by another, by
</p>
<p>which any member of the Society of Friends, who
</p>
<p>should decline to termiuiite his suit by arbitration
</p>
<p>before he went to law, was to be e.Kpelled, or "read
</p>
<p>out of meeting," as it is called by the society. A
</p>
<p>further instance was referred to. as showing another
</p>
<p>body of people of high consideration in tlie country,
</p>
<p>who were iii the constant habit of referring their
</p>
<p>disputes to arbitration, iind who had existing, in the

<p>the Ouzel Galley Club, for the purpose of determin-
</p>
<p>ing, by arbitraticm, the several disputes and dif-
</p>
<p>ferences between any persons who should think
</p>
<p>proper to submit to their decision. That is all cor-
</p>
<p>rect, and in that w.iy a great variety of mercantile
</p>
<p>questions in the city of Dublin <are constantly re-
</p>
<p>ferred to the arbitration and final decision of the
</p>
<p>members of the Ouzel Galley Club. But the system
</p>
<p>of .arbitration adopted by the Ouzel G.alley Club is
</p>
<p>not analagous to what is now proposed; because
</p>
<p>the Ouzel Galley Club, though it does take upon
</p>
<p>itself to decide the disputes and differences of those
</p>
<p>who think proper to refer to the decision of its niem-
</p>
<p>bt-rs, is based, in the first instance, on a writ issuing
</p>
<p>out of the superior courts, and it derives thcrcfoie
</p>
<p>itsjudicical authority in fact from thence ; it was so
</p>
<p>stated by Mr. Cosgnive  or else the submission to
</p>
<p>arbitration is made a rule of the court; in either
</p>
<p>case it remains subordinate to the supei ior cmirts.
</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, it is stated further, that this de-
</p>
<p>cision of disputes by arbitration is desirable upon a
</p>
<p>conscientious and religious principle, viz:  The
</p>
<p>putting a stop to the administering of oaths, which,
</p>
<p>before the law substituting a declaration for an o;itli,
</p>
<p>did e.xist to .an extent very much to be regretted,
</p>
<p>particularly in cases in whi-h the revenue was con-
</p>
<p>cerned. Those are all very plausible arguments to
</p>
<p>be brought forward now, and those are plausible
</p>
<p>examples to be set up as being the precedents, and
</p>
<p>the foundation upon which the jiresent arbitration
</p>
<p>courts were est.ablished by the association. Now,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, if the .association had acted really a bnnn

</p>
<p>executed by his officers." Sueh is the conmon law
</p>
<p>of this country ; and it is therefore an infringement
</p>
<p>and a violation of that lavr, if two or more persons
</p>
<p>pre-iume and take upon iliem to enter into a com.
</p>
<p>mon design to detract from tlie respect due to tlic
</p>
<p>Queen's courts of justice, and the way in which the
</p>
<p>law is administered in those courts. If any person
</p>
<p>has a grievance with regard to the manner in wlilcli
</p>
<p>his cause is treated in any of tlie King or Queen's
</p>
<p>courts, he has his remedy. The hiw is open to Inm,
</p>
<p>and there is a tribunal of ilemier ie:sart, vested for
</p>
<p>the most part in tlie house of lords. But to com-
</p>
<p>bine for the purpose of denying the power of the
</p>
<p>crown to erect those courts, or to detract from the
</p>
<p>character or the mode of administration of justice
</p>
<p>in tliose courts, is a direct otfence of a very high
</p>
<p>nature, and a direct inl'iingement of that privilege
</p>
<p>of the crov.'n that lias subsisted at all times, as I
</p>
<p>have read to you, in the kinj^dom of Great Britain
</p>
<p>and its de,.enden(ies. 'I'heiefore, it is something to
</p>
<p>be considered, what has taken place, and the man-
</p>
<p>ner in which these arbitration courts, and the prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of arbitialion was carried out. I hold in my
</p>
<p>hand a report of the arbitnition committee, pre-
</p>
<p>sentetl to the association, and dated the 21st of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 184.J. It was brought forward again in tlie

<p>repeal association on Wednesday, the 2hd of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1843, and was adopted, being moved by Dr.
</p>
<p>Gray, and seconded by Air. O'Hea, and carried una-
</p>
<p>nimously. You will find in this report a statement
</p>
<p>of the system that had been proposed by Dr. (J ray,
</p>
<p>submitted to the association, and by them carried
</p>
<p>into one of its laws. It is a report of a new system

<p>case, not for any particular district, but to be re-
</p>
<p>commended .and intended to be .adopted for the en-
</p>
<p>tire kingdom, so that in every part the courts erected
</p>
<p>under this recommendation, which are the associii-

</p>
<p>Queen's courts, which are not considered by Mr.
</p>
<p>O'Connell as longer dispensing justice to the sub-
</p>
<p>jects of the Icingdom. And rec(dleet, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>the offence contained in the indictment with regard
</p>
<p>to these courts, is not an attempt to estab ish arbi-
</p>
<p>tration courts, though perhaps that might (I do not
</p>
<p>say whether it would or would not) he .an otfence,
</p>
<p>or anything criminal, for parties to conspire to do
</p>
<p>so ; but the oft'ence charged is  which 1 take to he
</p>
<p>clearly criminal  a combinatiim to bring into dis-
</p>
<p>paragement and disrepute the courts of judicature
</p>
<p>.13 existing by law in the country, to bring them
</p>
<p>into contempt and disregard amongst the subjects
</p>
<p>of her Majesty, and to induce tliem to go to other
</p>
<p>tribunals for the purpose of terminating their dis-
</p>
<p>putes. That tlie parties did take measures to that
</p>
<p>effect, I have already stated to yon, by the reading
</p>
<p>in most unequivocal l.angiiage the ch.arges ag.ainst
</p>
<p>the existing courts as containeil in thai geneial ail-

</p>
<p>I have read to you, in .addition to that, the state-
</p>
<p>ment made by Mr. O'Connell at the great meeting
</p>
<p>at Connemara after the dinner, .as to the erection of
</p>
<p>these arbitration courts ; thereby, as he says liim-

<p>self, laying the foundation of new courts in which

<p>think that those aspersions on courtsof justice were

<p>cast by the traversers, or any or either of them,

<p>with a view of bringing those courts, and the ad-

<p>for the purpose of raising that feeling towards those

<p>courts, and if they have done so with a common de-

<p>sign, tlieii, gentlemen, I liave to tell you, that that

<p>is a high misdemeanour, is highly illegal, and if they

<p>that respect. There are four other grounds of accu-

<p>sation, which are contained in the present i idict-

<p>ment. I will put to you in writing again, what 1
</p>
<p>did before with regard to them. They are indicted,
</p>
<p>the eight traversers  and jou are to pronounce, by
</p>
<p>your deliberate conscientious verdict, whether they,
</p>
<p>or any, and which of them, did conspire and agree

<p>to raise and create discontent and disaffection

</p>
<p>mote ill-will to other of her subjects, especiitUy the

</p>
<p>they conspired and agreed to collect uidawful as-
</p>
<p>semblies in large numbers in Ireland, in order to
</p>
<p>obtain changes in the laws and constitution, by in-

<p>to induce the subjects of the crown to submit their

<p>that the traversers, or any of them conspired and

<p>agreed to do, or cause to be done, the said several
</p>
<p>matters or any of tliem, tlien you are to finil such

<p>traversers or traverser guilty of the fact of con-

<p>Mr. Henn  My lords, we submit that there is no
</p>
<p>evidence in this case of any act having been done to
</p>
<p>support this chaige within the county of the city of
</p>
<p>Dublin, and tliat we are, therefore, entitled to your
</p>
<p>lordship's direction for an acquittal, as the veuue is
</p>
<p>not properly laid.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice  What do j'ou call the meetings of
</p>
<p>the associaiion, and the speeches made there ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  There is no evidence to show that they
</p>
<p>were in the county of the city of Dublin ; but we
</p>
<p>only require a note of the objection to be taken.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Well, as the t:hief Justice is
</p>
<p>very much fatigued, I'll takeanoteof yourobjection.

<p>Their lordships then retired. Judge Burton having

<p>intimated that tliey were only going to the chamber,

<p>the exception of Mr. Justice Perrin,

<p>Mr. Moore, on th; partof the traversers, said tliat
</p>
<p>he was quite satisfied that the entire of the docu-

<p>ments should be given to the jury ; but he had been
</p>
<p>instructed that marks and scores had been made
</p>
<p>under particular parts of those read by the crovi-n,
</p>
<p>which he did not think should go before the jury.
</p>
<p>Moreover, he understood that the officer of the court
</p>
<p>had in his hands very many of the documents on
</p>
<p>that side, while he had very few indeed of the docu-
</p>
<p>ments on the side of the traversers. The documents

<p>for the defence were lodged with the officer when
</p>
<p>proved, and they (traversers' counsel) never saw
</p>
<p>them again.
</p>
<p>Judge Perrin  It was the duty of the officer to
</p>
<p>have taken care of all the documents on all sides.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General  We took care of our own
</p>
<p>documents, and they arc every one of them forth-
</p>
<p>coming: more could not h ive been expected from us.
</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Crown said that of eleven docu-
</p>
<p>ments which had been given in evidence for the
</p>
<p>defence, he had given back nine to the agents for
</p>
<p>the traversers, and he never saw them again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ford  I gave you back all the documents,
</p>
<p>most assuredly.
</p>
<p>Mr.'Henn  None of the newspapers we gave in
</p>
<p>evidence are forthcoming at all.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin_()h, yes, but they will be
</p>
<p>forthcoming. Mr. Vernon has got some of the news-
</p>
<p>papers; a messenger has gone for him, and he will
</p>
<p>be here presently.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Perrin, after the confusion caused by
</p>
<p>the non-production of the documents had in some
</p>
<p>degree subsided, addressed the foreman of the jury,
</p>
<p>and said  The cause of the delay is that some papers
</p>
<p>that ought to be before you, as they were given in
</p>
<p>evidence, are not forthcoming. They have been
</p>
<p>sent for, and I suppose will be here in a few minutes.

<p>Mr. Brewster  I rather think it will be found that
</p>
<p>all the documents are in court.
</p>
<p>After a few minutes more were occupied in an at-
</p>
<p>tempt to regulate and assort the docunients,
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn addressed Mr. Justice Perrin, and said
</p>
<p>I object to any papers going to the jury unless we
</p>
<p>see them first.
</p>
<p>THE FINDING OF THE JURY.
</p>

</p>
<p>The foreman, .apparently much agitated, inimc-
</p>
<p>diately withilrew.
</p>
<p>'I he sensation in court at this moment wa intle-
</p>
<p>scribable, it beins evident from tlie tone and man-
</p>
<p>ner, no less than from tlie words of the foreman, tliat
</p>
<p>the jury had determined to convict.
</p>
<p>At tlie end of five minutes, tlie foreman not having
</p>
<p>returned.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton, addressing the sheriff, said  T
</p>
<p>will go to chamber for a while. Should the jury
</p>
<p>come into court, have me called.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell, Q.C. and Mr. Henn, Q C , here
</p>
<p>came into court without wig or gown, and took
</p>
<p>their places with the other coiint-el for the traversers.
</p>
<p>His lordship then retired to chamber.
</p>
<p>An interval of neai-ly an hour now occurred.
</p>
<p>Puring this period a suspense of the most intense
</p>
<p>cliaracter pervaled the crowded court. The Attor-
</p>
<p>ney and Solicitor-General were observed momentarily
</p>
<p>to pull out their watches, and anxiously to compare
</p>
<p>time with Mr. Brewster and the other prosecuting
</p>
<p>counsel by whom they were surrounded.
</p>
<p>Quttfler to ElfVcn.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton again came iuto court, and di-
</p>
<p>rected the jury to be called.
</p>
<p>The High Sheriff proceeded to the jury- room, and
</p>
<p>ill a few minutes
</p>
<p>The foreman appeared and inquired of his lordship
</p>
<p>if they were to give their verdict under each count ?
</p>
<p>Court_Yes.
</p>
<p>foreman  And are we obliged to give our verdict
</p>
<p>on every count ?
</p>
<p>Court  Yes.
</p>
<p>Foreman  Whether we are agreed or not agreed ?

</p>
<p>Court  Yes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  Oh, my lord, it is necessary that the
</p>
<p>jury should agree ui)on each count.
</p>
<p>judge Crampton (to the foreman)  Don't misun-
</p>
<p>derstand mo. If you are agreed upon each count,
</p>
<p>or on all the counts, you h.ave only to say " not
</p>
<p>guilty," or " guilty," accordins to your verdict. If
</p>
<p>you only agree on some of the counts, you state-
</p>
<p>those on which you have agreed, and the traversers
</p>
<p>with respect to whom you agree.
</p>
<p>Foreman  Then we are only to state those on
</p>
<p>which we are agreed, and lake uo notice of the
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  There must be a finding on the
</p>
<p>others.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hatchell  If they don't agree, they can state
</p>
<p>that to the court.
</p>
<p>The foreman again retired.
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton  Mr. Attorney and Mr. Moore,
</p>
<p>I ara disposed to think that if the jury were agreed
</p>
<p>on certain counts, and could not agree on certain
</p>
<p>other counts, that I would be at liberty to receive
</p>
<p>their verdict so stated. I wish you (o consider that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  My lord, will it not be time enough
</p>
<p>to consider that question when itarises? I think it
</p>
<p>better to wait till the verdict is brought in.
</p>
<p>The jury came into court after an hour's absence.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crown  Gentlemen, answer to your
</p>
<p>names.
</p>
<p>Attorney-General  Call the tr.aversers.
</p>
<p>Clerk of the Crowu  After I shall have called the

<p>THE IRISH STATE TRIALS.
</p>
<p>the trarereers, if is your duty to return a verdict of
</p>
<p>guilty or not guilty, and if you cannot come to an
</p>
<p>agreement on any count or counts, you ought to say
</p>
<p>so in your verdict.
</p>
<p>TheForeman  My lord, we tliought the first count
</p>
<p>too coniprelicnsivc  that it included everything.
</p>
<p>Judge Ciampton  The first count does embrace
</p>
<p>all, and the other counts only lake the first count
</p>
<p>into pieces. You had hetterretireforafew moments
</p>
<p>and arrange your verdict.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floy I (oneof the jurors)  Would the verdict
</p>
<p>be correct if we put not guilty in the first and second
</p>
<p>counts ?
</p>
<p>Mr. .Justice Crampton  Yon sliould return a ver-
</p>
<p>dict of guilty on such parts of the first count as
</p>
<p>are identical with the other counts in respect of
</p>
<p>which you have returned a verdict of guilty, and
</p>
<p>yon should return a verdict of not guilty on such
</p>
<p>portions of the first count as are identical  ith the
</p>
<p>other counts in respect of wliich you consider that
</p>
<p>the traversers are not guilty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  If the jury think the traversers are
</p>
<p>not guilty on the first count, they have a right to
</p>
<p>pronounce their opinion on it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton  Of course they may.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore  And that is the question they .are
</p>
<p>asking your lordship.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Ciampton  The jury do not mean to
</p>
<p>find a contradictory verdict ; they do not mean by a
</p>
<p>single finding on the first count to contradict their
</p>
<p>finding on the other cimnts. Gentlemen, I think
</p>
<p>you understand that in reference to all these counts
</p>
<p>as to which you are agreed, that some of the defend-
</p>
<p>ants are guilty and some not. Y'ou ought to name

</p>
<p>in respect of which you are agreed, and if there are
</p>
<p>parts of the first count on which you cannot agree,
</p>
<p>that fact oui!;lit to be mentioned also. With respect
</p>
<p>to the first count, if I understan 1 you rightly, there
</p>
<p>are parts of that count im which yon have agreed,

<p>and parts on which you have not agreed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd (a juror)  No, my lord ; weareagreed
</p>
<p>on the first and second counts.
</p>
<p>Several Jurors_Oh no, no.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd  The jury has no difference of opinion;
</p>
<p>the only thing on which we have any difficulty is
</p>
<p>the exact terras in which the verdict ought to he
</p>
<p>framed.
</p>
<p>, The jury again retired.
</p>
<p>The. Attorney General We wish your lordsliip
</p>
<p>should inform the jury that they are not bound to
</p>
<p>find on the entire of the counts, and explain that the
</p>
<p>first ijoimt embraces several branches of the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, which is split up afterwards into the others.
</p>
<p>. Mr. Moore  We don't mean to ofler any argu-
</p>
<p>ments upon the point ; but on the part of the traver-
</p>
<p>sers we mean to object to the direction which we
</p>
<p>understood your lordshi]) to have given the jury :
</p>
<p>that if they should disagree upon some of the counts,
</p>
<p>they should express that disagreement. We respect-
</p>
<p>fully submit that such averdictcould not he received.
</p>
<p>Court  I5ut the jury say there is no disagreement.
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn  We also object to what the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General fays, that it is not necessary that they
</p>
<p>should find a verdict on all the counts, but tliey are
</p>
<p>at liberty to find a verdict on any one of the charges,
</p>
<p>and give no finding upon the others.

</p>
<p>submit that your lordship has no power to do any
</p>
<p>judicial act now'.
</p>
<p>Court  I have not my note-book here, but I shall
</p>
<p>remember your objection, Mr. Monahan, though I
</p>
<p>don't think it likely that you'll hear anything more
</p>
<p>of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd, one of the jurors, here came into the
</p>
<p>box and said, " My lord, are we wanted ?"
</p>
<p>Court  You are.
</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd  We wore sent for twice before, and
</p>
<p>we were not wanted.
</p>
<p>Court  Well, you have been sent for now for the
</p>
<p>third time, and you are wanted (laughter).
</p>
<p>All the jury then came into the box.
</p>
<p>Court  Geutlemen,! have a very unpleasant com-
</p>
<p>munication to make to you. The hour of twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock having now arrived, I am hiformed by the
</p>
<p>learned counsel for the crown that my jurisdiction
</p>
<p>to receive your verdict is at an end for this night,
</p>
<p>and until jlonday morning. I am very much dis-
</p>
<p>tressed at it ; but it has resulted from that circum-
</p>
<p>stance, and you must now remain in your jury-
</p>
<p>room, and give me your verdict on Monday morn-
</p>
<p>ing, until which time the court must be adjourned.
</p>
<p>This is a fatality arising out of the hour of twelve
</p>
<p>having arrived without the verdict being ready;
</p>
<p>and you will now retire to your chamber, where I
</p>
<p>have instructed the sheriff to provide you with every
</p>
<p>accommodation. Indeed, he I'equires no instruction,
</p>
<p>for he is most anxious to do all he can to make you
</p>
<p>comfortable. There will be sleeping accommodation
</p>
<p>provided for you, and every otiier accommodation
</p>
<p>you may require, and the high sheriff will, to-
</p>
<p>morrow, at a proper hour, accompany you to divine

<p>separate out of his custody. You will remain in
</p>
<p>your room up to the period to attend divine ser-
</p>
<p>vice  if you choose to attend it  and on Jlonday
</p>
<p>morning I, or some of the other judges of this court,
</p>
<p>will be ready to receive your verdict. I am ex-
</p>
<p>tremely sorry to be obliged to announce this to you,
</p>
<p>but there is no alternative.
</p>
<p>Mr. Monahan  I submit to your lordship that
</p>
<p>you have now no power to adjourn, or to do any
</p>
<p>other offici.al act at this hour.
</p>
<p>His Lordship received the objection, and then
</p>
<p>adjourned the court to nine o'clock ou Monday
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>[During the time the jury were in deliberation,
</p>
<p>immense crowds of persons were assembled outside
</p>
<p>the court, who alternately cheered and hissed as
</p>
<p>different rumours reached their ears. However,
</p>
<p>when the real result was communicated to them,
</p>
<p>they separated in comparative quiet, but muttering
</p>
<p>anything save benedictions on the jury.]
</p>
<p>T'WENTY-FirTH DAY.
</p>
<p>Monday, February 12.
</p>
<p>The most intense excitement prevailed this morn-
</p>
<p>ing to ascertain the final issue of the trial, or to know
</p>
<p>whether any change of opinion had haply taken place
</p>
<p>in the minds of the jury from the time they were
</p>
<p>locked up on Saturday night. Long before the hour
</p>
<p>to which the court stood adjourned, namely, nine
</p>
<p>o'clock, dense masses of people had assembled in
</p>
<p>front of the courts, and the line of quays leading to
</p>
<p>them were thronged with anxious inquirers awaiting
</p>
<p>the intelligence which all so eagerly anticipated.

<p>Jlr. O'Counell and the other traversers arrived a

</p>
<p>wards the English people. The third was for a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to create discontent and disaflfection in the
</p>
<p>army. The fourth, to procure divers subjects of
</p>
<p>her Majesty unlawfully and seditiously to assemble
</p>
<p>together at different places for the purpose of obtain-
</p>
<p>ing, by intimidation, or by the exhibition of great
</p>
<p>physical force, changes to be made in the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, government, and laAvs of the realm ; and the
</p>
<p>fifth, for conspiring to bring into hatred and disre-
</p>
<p>pute the courts of justice in'Ireland, with intent to
</p>
<p>induce those subjects to withdraw the adjustment
</p>
<p>of their disputes to other tribunals. Now, he cou-
</p>
<p>Bidered that the jury should say which if any of the
</p>
<p>defendants were guilty, and which not guilty, of
</p>
<p>those distinct charges in the first count. Then,
</p>
<p>with respect to the second, it was precisely the
</p>
<p>Eame, only that it did not state the overt acts, as
</p>
<p>they should give the same finding on it as on the
</p>
<p>first. In the third count there were also five issues,
</p>
<p>which were substantially the same, although there
</p>
<p>were some slight technical differences not at all ma-
</p>
<p>terial, which could not affect the finding. In the
</p>
<p>fourth count there were four issues
</p>
<p>Attorney- General (reading from a paper, and ap-
</p>
<p>parently following his lordsliip)  Only three issues,
</p>
<p>my lord.
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton (looking again to his paper)
</p>
<p>.  Oh, you are right, Mr. Attorney. In the fourth
</p>
<p>count there are only three issues, which are the same
</p>
<p>as those in the first, with the exception of charges two
</p>
<p>and three. The fifth contained only three, and was
</p>
<p>also the same as the first, except in the first and
</p>
<p>second charges. The sixth only contained one
</p>
<p>charge, the same as number four in the first count.

</p>
<p>Then the seventh count was the same, only that it
</p>
<p>introduced the words " unlawfully and seditiously."
</p>
<p>The eighth, ninth, and tenth counts, proved the
</p>
<p>same with some technical differences; and tlie
</p>
<p>eleventh was in a distinct form, and called on the
</p>
<p>jurors to sa}', whether the defendants, or any of
</p>
<p>them, collected large numbers of persons to assemble
</p>
<p>to intimidate the government, in order to compel
</p>
<p>them to make certain changes in the constitution of
</p>
<p>the house of parliament. Now, he (Judge Crampton)
</p>
<p>thought that the jury would have no difficulty if the
</p>
<p>issues were sent up to them in the form which he
</p>
<p>had read, instead of the general form with which
</p>
<p>they had been furnished ; and he would suggest that
</p>
<p>they should be called out, in order that they might
</p>
<p>get the proper directions to say which of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants were guilty, and which not guilty of the
</p>
<p>several specific charges.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice directed the sheriff to have the
</p>
<p>jury called into court, and
</p>
<p>Judge Crampton proceeded to mention that an
</p>
<p>objection had been taken upon Saturday evening,
</p>
<p>in the absence of the other members of the court, by
</p>
<p>Mr. Henn, to the effect that no evidence was given
</p>
<p>of the acts and proceedings laid in the indictment
</p>
<p>having taken place within the county of the city of
</p>
<p>Dublin, which he submitted should have been proved
</p>
<p>in order to sustain it. Mr. Monahan also made an
</p>
<p>objection, which he would mention, namely, that
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it was then (when he made the objec-
</p>
<p>tion) Sunday morning, that the court had no further
</p>
<p>power to proceed with the case, or do any judicial
</p>
<p>act, and that therefore the trial should lapse until

<p>the first day of Easter Term.

<p>Signed by the foreman,
</p>
<p>for self and fellow-jurors.
</p>
<p>Tlie reading of the verdict having been concluded,
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice, addressing the coiinsfJ on both
</p>
<p>sides, said he supposed there was nothing further to
</p>
<p>detain the jury.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General replied that there was not.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice, turning to the jury, said,
</p>
<p>that after the very laudable pains and attention
</p>
<p>which they had paid to the case, from the beginning
</p>
<p>to the end, when he considered the great inconve-
</p>
<p>nience which their loss of time and absence from
</p>
<p>their pursuits must have caused them  he was sorry
</p>
<p>it was not in the power of the court to order them
</p>
<p>compensation. The act of parliament did not war-
</p>
<p>rant tliem to do so, nor was there any law made, he
</p>
<p>believed, to meet the necessities of such an extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary case as tliat had been. The duty of a jury-
</p>
<p>man was one imposed on every member of society 
</p>
<p>each must perform it in his turn, when called on ;
</p>
<p>and he trusted that all jurors so called on would
</p>
<p>follow the example set by the gentlemen whom he
</p>
<p>addressed, in paying such strict attention to what
</p>
<p>was brought under their consideration. It was, in-
</p>
<p>deed, highly creditable and laudable, and he was
</p>
<p>sorry that his saying so was all he could do for them.
</p>
<p>He repeated, he had no power to order them com-
</p>
<p>pensation, and could do no more than thank them
</p>
<p>for their attendance, and dismiss them.
</p>
<p>The jury were then discharged, and were sent to
</p>
<p>their respective homes in covered cars.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore asked if there was any objection to
</p>
<p>furnish the traversers with a copy of the finding ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crampton could see no objection. He
