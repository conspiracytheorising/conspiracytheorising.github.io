<p>acquaintance with Roman literature, or even with Ro-
</p>
<p>man history. The old arrangement violates the order
</p>
<p>of time, since the attempt of Catiline to overthrow the
</p>
<p>government of his country was subsequent to the war
</p>
<p>with Jugurtha by a period of nearly fifty years. The
</p>
<p>impression produced, therefore, on the mind of the
</p>
<p>student, from his being required to read the two works
</p>
<p>in an inverted order, must, of necessity, be a confused
</p>
<p>one. In the account of Catiline's conspiracy, for ex-
</p>
<p>ample, he will find frequent allusions to the calamitous
</p>
<p>consequences of SyHa'fl strife with Marios, and will see
</p>
<p>many of the profligate partisans of the former rallying
</p>
<p>around the standard of Catiline; while, in the history
</p>
<p>of the Jugurthine war, if he be made to peruse it
</p>
<p>the other, in the ordinary routine of school-reading, he
</p>
<p>will be introduced to the same Sylla, just entering on
</p>
<p>a public career, and standing high in the favour and
</p>
<p>confidence of Marios! llov. ill he be able to
</p>
<p>appreciate, in their full force, the remarks of Sallust re-
</p>
<p>lative to the successive changes in the Roman form of
</p>
<p>government, and the alternate ascendency of the ai
</p>
<p>cratic and popular parties, if he be called upon to di
</p>
<p>his attention to results before he is made acquainted
</p>
<p>with the causes that produced them ? The only argu-
</p>
<p>ment adduced in favour of the old arrangement is, that
</p>
<p>Sallust composed the narrative of Catiline's conspi
</p>
<p>before that of the Juuurthine war, and that all the

</p>
<p>follow this same order, and place the account of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy first. Such an argument, however, if it be
</p>
<p>really deserving of the name, must weigh but little
</p>
<p>when positive utility is placed in the opposite scale.
</p>
<p>The order, moreover, for which we contend, is no nov-
</p>
<p>elty on the continent of Europe, as may be seen from
</p>
<p>the works of the at De Brosses, the Abbe

<p>In conclusion, the editor feels, that it would be the
</p>
<p>worst species of affectation in him, were he to conceal
</p>
<p>the pleasure he has experienced, at the very favourable
</p>
<p>reception which has been given to the previous editions
</p>
<p>of this work. And he thinks he may be allowed to
</p>
<p>state, with pardonable pride, that two separate re-prints,
</p>
<p>by different editors, total strangers to himself, have also
</p>
<p>appeared in England, and that too without any effort
</p>
<p>on his own part to procure, in that country, a re-publi-
</p>
<p>cation of his labours. C. ANTHi

<p>LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>DR. BARTON- 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well, Henry, how are you pleased with Oxford!  I have
</p>
<p>met ur arrival among us, but have never be-
</p>
<p>fore this had an opportun :, or of ascertaining
</p>
<p>how you liked your new residence.
</p>
<p>H. I am delighted with it. my dear Doctor, and feel like a new being
</p>
<p>amid these classic shades. 'With the means of DD] now fully
</p>
<p>under my own contr ned to make that use of my 1
</p>
<p>which shall lead in after life, with the divine bli LMOfl and
</p>
<p>honourable distinction. My reeding begins, in fact, to assume a new
</p>
<p>character, and my attention is mure and more d feted every day to
</p>
<p>works of solid utih* !, that I ha
</p>
<p>you on the present occasion, as I ha\
</p>
<p>literature, and wish to consult you about the merits of a writer, in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to whom, I am, I confess, in a good deal of doubt  I mean the his-
</p>
<p>torian Sallust.
</p>
<p>l>r B. I can easily con wit an ardent admirer like
</p>
<p>yourself of the character (lined to
</p>
<p>(1 the cold appL h Sallust bestows upon the saviour of his
</p>
<p>country, in the light of a del. ij>on his escutcheon
</p>
<p>as an historian. Nor will I stand fort: .ing,
</p>
<p>how. the rankling of private animosity, and
</p>
<p>something to disgust at
</p>
<p>Roman consul. For, after all .at if history ! A mere place
</p>
<p>of exhibition, where the sjM-ctators are too little acquainted with the
</p>
<p>hidden causes of what they behold, and the actor3 are too directly inter-
</p>
<p>ested in the result, to enable ne I L, with any degree of certainty,
</p>
<p>on the accounts of either the one or the ot
</p>
<p>H. Your remark is a very just on< Doctor, and ought to
</p>
<p>teach us the utter uncertainty of I i of knowledge, except
</p>
<p>where it bears the impress from on high. History, in the former case,
</p>
<p>may be likened to the arid plains of Egypt, where the half-buried temple,

<p>and half-deciphered inscription, tell the tale of other days, but tell it in
</p>
<p>dark and mysterious language ; while, in the latter, she stands like the
</p>
<p>pyramids of that same Eastern land, alone in the midst of ruins, resting
</p>
<p>securely on the rock of ages, and pointing upward to the skies.  But I
</p>
<p>am wandering from my subject. Would it be too great an encroachment
</p>
<p>on your valuable time, Doctor, were I to ask for a brief sketch of the life
</p>
<p>of the historian 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Not at all, Henry. I am perfectly at leisure, and will accede
</p>
<p>to your request with the utmost readiness. Should any thing, however,
</p>
<p>strike you in the course of my remarks, as being either at variance with
</p>
<p>your pre-conceived notions, or savouring too much of mere speculation,
</p>
<p>you will oblige me by a candid communication of your sentiments.
</p>
<p>H. There will be very little occasion for this, my dear Doctor, as I
</p>
<p>am a mere novice in matters of literary history, and am come prepared
</p>
<p>to listen rather than to oppose. I will avail myself, however, of your
</p>
<p>very kind offer, to ask an occasional question or two, should any thing
</p>
<p>appear to me either novel or obscure.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well then, to begin with the name itself, the German scholars,
</p>
<p>whose research nothing can escape, are divided in opinion as to the pro-
</p>
<p>priety of writing Sallustius or Salustius, and Crispus Sallustius or
</p>
<p>Sallustius Crispus. 1 I believe it will be found, upon an examination of
</p>
<p>authorities, that Sallustius is the more correct form, and Crispus Sal-
</p>
<p>lustius the more usual arrangement of the manuscripts. It would seem,
</p>
<p>however, that, in the golden age of Latin literature, it was customary to
</p>
<p>place the cognomen after the nomen, and in the silver age to reverse this
</p>
<p>order.2  But let us proceed to the historian himself. Sallust was born
</p>
<p>at Amiternum, a town of the Sabines, B. C. 86, or A. U. C. 668. He
</p>
<p>received his education at Rome, and, in his early youth, appears to have
</p>
<p>been desirous of devoting himself to literary pursuits. 
</p>
<p>H. Allow me to interrupt you, my dear Doctor, and to ask whether
</p>
<p>it be not a very remarkable circumstance, that so many of the Latin
</p>
<p>writers were natives, not of the capital, but of the provinces, of Italy ?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The most careless inquirer, Henry, into the literary history
</p>
<p>of Rome, cannot but be struck by the singular fact, that so many of the

</p>
<p>distinguished individuals who grace the literary annals of the empire-city,
</p>
<p>were born, not in Rome itself, but either in foreign lands, or in the prov-
</p>
<p>inces of the Italian peninsula. Had the queen of nations adhered in
</p>
<p>later days to the selfish and exclusive policy, by which all who were not
</p>
<p>born within her walls were at first debarred from the full enjoyment of

<p>the privileges of citizenship, how few of the great names that now adorn
</p>
<p>the history of her literature could have been claimed by her as her own.
</p>
<p>Livius Andronicus, for example, was a slave from Magna Graecia ;
</p>
<p>Ennius was a native of the same quarter of Italy ; Naevius was a Cam-
</p>
<p>panian ; Plautus came from Umbria ; Pacuvius was born at Brundisium,
</p>
<p>Terence at Carthage, Catullus at Verona, Cicero at Arpinum, Virgil at
</p>
<p>Andes, Propertius in Umbria, Horace in Apulia, Livy at Patavium, Ovid
</p>
<p>at Sulmo, Lucan in Spain> the elder Pliny at Verona, and Tacitus at the
</p>
<p>Umbrian city of Interamna. You see then, Henry, that Rome may be
</p>
<p>said to have acquired her literary, as she did her martial^ fame, by the
</p>
<p>exertions of her allies, the provincials of Italy.
</p>
<p>H. Yes, Doctor, and it is only transferring to the operations of intel-
</p>
<p>lect the old proverb about the Marsi, that there was no triumph either
</p>
<p>over them or without them ; ovts Kara Mdpffcjv, ovre avev Mapo-coy, yeviaBai
</p>
<p>dpiafipov. 1  But let us return to Sallust.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Notwithstanding his early zeal for literary pursuits, our his-
</p>
<p>torian appears to have been soon involved in that striving after military
</p>
<p>or political distinction, which formed so conspicuous a feature of the age
</p>
<p>in which he lived. We find him, accordingly, at twenty-seven, filling
</p>
<p>the office of quaestor, which entitled him, of course, to a seat in the
</p>
<p>senate, and, about six years afterwards, elected to the important post of
</p>
<p>tribune of the commons. While discharging the duties of this magis-
</p>
<p>tracy, he attached himself to the rising fortunes of Julius Caesar, and,
</p>
<p>during its continuance also, he conducted, along with one of his col-
</p>
<p>leagues, the prosecution against Milo for the murder of Clodius.  Thus
</p>
<p>far all seems to have gone well with Sallust. In the year of Rome, how-
</p>
<p>ever, 704, or 50 B. C, he was excluded from the senate, by the censors
</p>
<p>Appius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Piso, for an act of gross im-
</p>
<p>morality. 2
</p>
<p>H. You surprise me, Dr. Barton.  Sallust, wnose writings breathe
</p>
<p>so lofty an air of rigid morality.  'Sallust, the stern declaimer against
</p>
<p>luxury and all its train of attendant vices  a votary at the shrine of licen-
</p>
<p>tiousness and profligacy 1

<p>undoubtedly that noisy species, which is so fond of descanting on the
</p>
<p>failings and delinquencies of others. Sallust, aye, and even Seneca
</p>
<p>too, notwithstanding the eulogiums of Diderot upon the latter, 3 remind
</p>
<p>me very strongly, when regarded as moralists, of Dr. Johnson's remark,

<p>was confessedly a man of loose and corrupt principles, it is far from
</p>
<p>being certain that he was the monster of iniquity which some have been
</p>
<p>pleased to represent him. In the case at present under consideration, it
</p>
<p>is more than probable that he owed his exclusion from the senate to the
</p>
<p>violence of the patrician party, to which he was warmly opposed. The
</p>
<p>female, whose name is connected with this disgraceful affair was Fausta,
</p>
<p>the daughter of Sylla, and wife of Milo, and the injured husband is said
</p>
<p>to have caused the offender to be scourged by his slaves. 1 Now, as
</p>
<p>Fausta was not more remarkable for her personal attractions than for
</p>
<p>utter want of character, it seems rather extraordinary that, at a time
</p>
<p>when the corruption of manners had almost reached its maximum, the
</p>
<p>intimacy of a Roman senator with so abandoned a female should be
</p>
<p>deemed worthy of so severe a punishment as expulsion from his order.
</p>
<p>I cannot but think, therefore, that Sallust was sacrificed to the party
</p>
<p>spirit which agitated, and in fact divided, the republic. The prosecution
</p>
<p>against Milo, as has already been remarked, took place the same year
</p>
<p>that Sallust was tribune of the commons ; and the latter, who was a de-
</p>
<p>voted partisan of Caesar, had found means to defeat the plans of Cicero
</p>
<p>and the republican party, and procure the condemnation of Milo. Now the
</p>
<p>censor Appius Pulcher was seeking, it appears, the friendship of Cicero,
</p>
<p>whose aid was necessary to his projects, and it would seem that, in order
</p>
<p>to propitiate the good will of the orator, and other individuals of the party
</p>
<p>of Pompey, he ventured upon a decisive step against Sallust, which he
</p>
<p>sought to hide beneath the specious pretext of a regard for public morals. 2
</p>
<p>What think you of this theory, Henry Arlington !
</p>
<p>H. I am strongly inclined to adopt it, my dear Doctor, since, admit-
</p>
<p>ing it to be true, we may, without regarding Sallust as at all more vir-
</p>
<p>tuous than the great body of his contemporaries, be enabled to shield
</p>
<p>him, by this means, from the virulent abuse of Pompey's freedman Lenaeus,
</p>
<p>whose work should rather be called a frantic satire than an historical
</p>
<p>document. 3  But proceed, if you please, with the life of the Roman.

<p>a share eventually in the expedition to Africa, where the scattered rem-
</p>
<p>nants of Pompey's party had rallied under the banners of Scipio and
</p>
<p>Juba. When this region was subdued, he was left by Caesar as praetor
</p>
<p>of Numidia ; and, about the same time, he married Terentia, the di-
</p>
<p>vorced wife of Cicero. i
</p>
<p>H. What a blessing it must have been, Dr. Barton, to have lived un-
</p>
<p>der so virtuous a governor.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. If Dio Cassius speak the truth, Henry, I would rather be ex-
</p>
<p>cused from being governed by such a praetor as Sallust. The historian
</p>
<p>gives a sorry picture of his administration in Africa, charging him with
</p>
<p>flagrant extortion, and with the open despoiling of his province. Caesar,
</p>
<p>he says, assigned this region unto him, " to govern it in appearance, but,
</p>
<p>to plunder it in reality," \6yo) \xlv ap^eiv, Zpyr? te ayetv re kcu cpipciv knitpc*

</p>
<p>means backward in fulfilling Caesar's expectations ; for, to borrow another

<p>phrase from Dio, he did not put in practice what he wrote, ovk efxifjLfiaaro

</p>
<p>H. You succeeded so well a moment ago, Doctor, in defending Sal-
</p>
<p>lust from another charge, that I wish you would again become his advo-
</p>
<p>cate on the present occasion. Is there nothing that can be urged in his
</p>
<p>behalf!
</p>
<p>Dr. B. It would not require much skill, Henry, to make out a very
</p>
<p>plausible case in favour of Sallust, and that too on grounds merely of a
</p>
<p>probable nature. For it is difficult to conceive, how such conduct, as is
</p>
<p>alleged against him, can be in any way reconciled with the principles
</p>
<p>professed by him in his writings, or how a man so deeply guilty, as his
</p>
<p>enemies made him to be, could have publicly affected such rigid morali-
</p>
<p>ty, without outraging, in the most shameless manner, the feelings of all
</p>
<p>his contemporaries. We are tempted to believe, therefore, that Dio Cas-
</p>
<p>sius, and the writers who, after him, have repeated these discreditable
</p>
<p>stories, were led astray by the declamations of the numerous enemies of
</p>
<p>our historian. One of the later editors, indeed, of the works of Sallust,
</p>
<p>has started a singular hypothesis, according to which, Dio is thought to

</p>
<p>H. I would like to decide, Doctor, in favour of Sallust, but I feel
</p>
<p>myself bound in candour to pronounce an opinion against him. The
</p>
<p>arguments, just adduced in his favour, are, to say the best of them, more
</p>
<p>imposing than solid, and the hypothesis which you were kind enough to
</p>
<p>mention is too absurd to require a serious refutation.  But what was the
</p>
<p>fate of Sallust under this charge of extortion and spoilation 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. It was such as might have been expected in the peculiar
</p>
<p>complexion of the times. He was acquitted by Caesar, his all-pow-
</p>
<p>erful protectoi.  After the expiration of his government, Sallust re-
</p>
<p>nounced all public employments, and betook himself to a luxurious re-
</p>
<p>tirement, with his, as I fear you will term it, ill-gotten wealth. He
</p>
<p>chose for his favourite retreats, a villa at Tibur, which had belonged to
</p>
<p>Caesar, and a magnificent palace, which he built in the suburbs of Rome,
</p>
<p>surrounded by delightful pleasure-grounds, afterwards well known and
</p>
<p>celebrated by the name of the Gardens of Sallust. Possessed of every
</p>
<p>attraction, the Sallustian palace and gardens became, after the death
</p>
<p>of their original proprietor, the residence of successive emperors. Au-
</p>
<p>gustus chose them as the scene of his most sumptuous entertainments.
</p>
<p>The taste of Vespasian preferred them to the palace of the Caesars.
</p>
<p>Even the virtuous Ncrva, and stern Aurelian, were so attracted by their
</p>
<p>beauty, that, while at Rome, they made them their constant abode. 1  In
</p>
<p>these gardens, or in his villa at Tibur, Sallust passed the concluding years
</p>
<p>of his life, dividing his time between literary avocations and the society
</p>
<p>of his friends, among whom he numbered Lucuilus, Messala, and Corne-
</p>
<p>lius Nepos.
</p>
<p>II. But, my dear Doctor, if such were Sallust's friends, and such his
</p>
<p>favourite studies, how is it possible that he could have indulged in that
</p>
<p>excessive libertinism which has been so often imputed to him!
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Your question, 11 i put, and certainly does not
</p>
<p>admit of an easy answer. I think it more than probable, therefore, that
</p>
<p>the historian has been here confounded with the dissolute individual of
</p>
<p>the same name whom Horace mentions in the first book of his satires.
</p>
<p>For my own part, I do not doubt, as I have already remarked, but that
</p>
<p>our author was a man of loose morals, and that he rapaciouslv plun-

</p>
<p>never believe him to have been, as he is sometimes depicted, an aban-
</p>
<p>doned profligate. Much of the obloquy, that was heaped upon his name
</p>
<p>appears to have emanated from political antagonists, and, of all things-in
</p>
<p>this world, political diatribes are assuredly the most pregnant with false-
</p>
<p>hood. Now Sallust, it seems, being the decided enemy of Pompey,

<p>had said of that Roman, that he was a man u oris probi, animo invert-'

<p>cundo." Lenaeus, the freedman of Pompey, to whom you alluded a
</p>
<p>short time ago, avenged his master by the most virulent abuse of his

<p>enemy, in a work which would seem to have made a complete sacrifice

<p>of truth to invective 1
</p>
<p>H. From what premises. Doctor, do you draw this latter inference,
</p>
<p>since the work itself has not come down to us \
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Why, Henry, we may fairly judge, I think, of the injustice
</p>
<p>which he did to the life of the historian, from what he says of him as
</p>
<p>an author. He calls him, as we learn from Suetonius, " nebulonem
</p>
<p>vita seriptisque monstrosum ; praeterea priscorum Catonisque inerudi-
</p>
<p>tissimum furem."2 This is the language of one of your thorough-going
</p>
<p>political partisans, who has entrusted hi3 reason as well as his principles to
</p>
<p>the safe-keeping of his leader  I wish we had the life of Sallust written

</p>
<p>as a corrective of the unfavourable irnpr* ch have been pro-
</p>
<p>duced by this libel, for it deserves no better name, of the freedman of
</p>
<p>Pompey.
</p>
<p>H. Aye, Doctor, but what will you sav to the declamation againat
</p>
<p>Sallust which has actually reached our times, and that too from the
</p>
<p>pen of Cicero 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Cicero never wrote it, Henry. It appeared long after the
</p>
<p>death of that orator, and is now generally assigned, by critics, to a rheto-
</p>
<p>rician in the reign of Claudius, called Porcius Latro. It is in the style
</p>
<p>of what we may suppose Lenaeus's work to have been, a tissue of invent*
</p>
<p>ed or exaggerated calumnies, altogether unworthy of grave credence. 3
</p>
<p>H. And yet, Doctor, I was told by Boydel, of Christ-church, no longer
</p>
<p>ago than last evening, that 1 . ssor at Am-
</p>
<p>sterdam, and all : of Prague, in their respective accounts of the
</p>
<p>life of Sallust, have adopted these very calumnies which you so openly
</p>
<p>condemn.

</p>
<p>tate in the art of historic composition, since that was irt a very low
</p>
<p>state when Sallust began to write. He, therefore, naturally recurred to
</p>
<p>the productions of the Greek historians, and attempted to transplant into
</p>
<p>his own language the vigour and conciseness which characterise in so
</p>
<p>eminent a degree the style of Thucydides. 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Very correctly remarked, my young friend, only you ought to
</p>
<p>have added, that the strict imitation, with which Sallust has followed
</p>
<p>his Grecian prototype, has gone far towards lessening the effect of his
</p>
<p>own original genius. Still we cannot but admire the wonderful success
</p>
<p>of the Roman writer, in imitating the vigour and conciseness of the
</p>
<p>Grecian historian, and infusing into his composition something of that
</p>
<p>dignified austerity which distinguishes the work of his great model.
</p>
<p>H. But, Doctor, you surely do not mean to be understood as affirm-
</p>
<p>ing, that Sallust's style is an imitation of that of Thucydides 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. The question does you credit, Henry. I mean, when I say
</p>
<p>that Sallust imitates the historian of the Peloponnesian war, an imita-
</p>
<p>tion of his general manner, his rapidity, his force, his power of com-
</p>
<p>pression, rather than of his language. Thucydides, for example, often
</p>
<p>employs long and involved periods, while Sallust is ever abrupt and sen-
</p>
<p>tentious, even to a fault.  Have you taken notice how often the latter
</p>
<p>rejects the copulative \
</p>
<p>H. I have, Doctor, and I think it produces a monotonous efTect, and
</p>
<p>a total want of that flow and variety which constitute the principal charm
</p>
<p>of the historic period.  I was walking yesterday, with a fellow-common-
</p>
<p>er of All-Souls, and, the conversation happening to turn upon Sallust,
</p>
<p>and the peculiarities of his style, we made up between us the following
</p>
<p>list of items, about which, my dear Doctor, although a little matter in it-
</p>
<p>self, I would like to have your opinion.  We noticed, in the first place,
</p>
<p>that, in the ablative absolute, he sometimes suppresses the noun ; as,
</p>
<p>proctitis quos ducebat ;' 2 and the antecedent to the relative ; as, quam ob
</p>
<p>quae pracdicabat.3 We observed also particular expressions frequently
</p>
<p>occurring ; as ex sentcntia, etiam turn, sine mora, cVc. Then again, we
</p>
<p>found several instances, where two words nearly synonymous were em-
</p>
<p>ployed ; as, earns, acceptusquc,  varius incertusquc,  bonum atquc hon-

<p>infinitive for the gerund ; as gratificari for gratificandi,*  adgredi, for

<p>adgrcdiendi ; 5 and the omission of the connectives et and que occurs
</p>
<p>on almost every page. Another peculiarity, also, forced itself upon our

<p>same sentence ; and, as for his archaisms, we voted the greater part of
</p>
<p>them to be decided specimens oi the worst kind of affectation.  Well,
</p>
<p>Doctor, what do you think of our critique?
</p>
<p>Dr. B. I like it, Henry ; and think that you and your fellow-Oxonian
</p>
<p>have given a very fair sketch of the minor peculiarities of Sallust.
</p>
<p>"Whether his archaisms, however, deserve the name of affectations is a
</p>
<p>point on which you will find many differing from you. My own opinion
</p>
<p>is with you and your friend. Sallust introduces into his history a num-
</p>
<p>ber of words almost considered in his time as obsolete, and which were
</p>
<p>selected from the works of the older authors of Rome, particularly Cato
</p>
<p>the censor ; and it is here that he laid himself open to attack from Pollio
</p>
<p>in his letters to Plancus. His style, on the whole, indicates too much
</p>
<p>study and careful pruning, and is deficient in gracefulness and ease. I
</p>
<p>would not advise you to make him your model.
</p>
<p>H. iids me, Doctor, of old Roger Ascham's work, "The
</p>
<p>Schoolmaster," which I slightly examined the other day in the Bodleian,
</p>
<p>and where I found the opinion of Sir John Cheke relative to the merits
</p>
<p>of Sallust's Latinity. Sir John >aid, M that he could not recommend Sal-
</p>
<p>lust as a good pattern > voung men, because in his writings
</p>
<p>there was more art than nature, and more lalour than art ; and in his

</p>
<p>drawn by him have been N -garded in all ages as master-pieces of their

</p>
<p>colours, from amid the vice and degeneracy of his time. And, again, in

<p>xviii LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>while the words of Marius are the effusions of a blunt and gallant soldier
</p>
<p>who had as yet displayed no traces of the cold-blooded assassin, the
</p>
<p>tyrant, buffoon, and usurper.
</p>
<p>H. But is it possible, Dr. Barton, that Sallust can be correct, in
</p>
<p>making Caesar a sceptic with regard to the soul's immortality 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Aye, Henry, and worse than a sceptic, a downright unbeliever.
</p>
<p>The whole tenour of Caesar's life is in strict accordance with this. His
</p>
<p>secret disregard for all morality, his open contempt for all honourable
</p>
<p>principles, his cold and selfish and murderous ambition, as if the lives
</p>
<p>of his fellow-men were but the playthings of an hour  every thing, in
</p>
<p>short, in the character of this remarkable man, reveals to our view a
</p>
<p>bosom warmed by no spark of social feeling, but as dark and as silent as
</p>
<p>the grave. It was but natural, therefore, that such a mind should see,
</p>
<p>or rather wish to see, in the horizon of the future, nothing but the gloom
</p>
<p>of annihilation, and should regard the doctrine of a future state of exist-
</p>
<p>ence as a bubble and a dream. How different from all this is the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of our own philosopher, who had penetrated deeply into the mys-
</p>
<p>teries of nature, and yet, with humbled feelings, could stoop to kindle
</p>
<p>the torch of knowledge at the altars of his God. " I envy no quality
</p>
<p>of the mind," he remarks, " or of intellect in others, be it genius, power,
</p>
<p>wit, or fancy : but if I could choose what would be most delightful, and
</p>
<p>I believe most useful to me, I should prefer a firm religious belief to
</p>
<p>every other blessing ; for it makes life a discipline of goodness ; creates
</p>
<p>new hopes, when all earthly hopes vanish ; and throws over the decay,
</p>
<p>the destruction of existence, the most gorgeous of all lights ; awakens
</p>
<p>life even in death, and from corruption and decay calls up beauty and
</p>
<p>divinity ; makes an instrument of torture and shame the ladder of ascent
</p>
<p>to Paradise ; and, far above all combinations of earthly hopes, calls up
</p>
<p>the most delightful visions of palms and amaranths, the gardens of the
</p>
<p>blest, the security of everlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic
</p>

<p>cal speculations of La Place, who could see in the wonders of the uni-
</p>
<p>verse no indications of the finger of a Deity.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Why, Henry, as for atheists, if such singular beings do in
</p>
<p>fact exist, there is one simple argument which they can never answer.
</p>
<p>Ere we can say that there is no God, we must have roamed over all
</p>
<p>nature, and seen that no mark of a divine footstep was there ; and we
</p>
<p>must have gotten intimacy with every existent spirit in the universe, and

</p>
<p>learned from each that never did a revelation of the Deity visit him ;
</p>
<p>and vvc must have searched, not into the records of one solitary planet,
</p>
<p>but into the archives of all worlds, and thence gathered, that, throughout
</p>
<p>the wide realms of immensity, not one exhibition of a reigning and living
</p>
<p>God ever has been made. In other words, before man can deny the
</p>
<p>existence of God, he must be a God himself, for he must possess the
</p>
<p>ubiquity and omniscience of the Godhead. 1  But let us return from our
</p>
<p>digression. Where were we 1
</p>
<p>H. We were alluding to the skill which Sallust displays in adapting
</p>
<p>his speeches to different characters.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Well, then, we will now take up the consideration of his
</p>
<p>works.  The first production of Sallust was the " Conspiracy of Cati-
</p>
<p>line." He had attained the age of twenty-two years when the conspiracy
</p>
<p>broke out, and was an eye-witness of the whole proceedings. He had,
</p>
<p>therefore, every means in his power for giving an accurate history of this
</p>
<p>very remarkable event, nor has he neglected to employ them. In the
</p>
<p>detail of facts, he is entitled to our fullest confidence ; for, in every thing
</p>
<p>of importance, he coincides fully with Cicero, whose Catilinarian orations
</p>
<p>form, in fact, an excellent commentary on the work of the historian.
</p>
<p>But Sallust lived too near the times which he describes to be an impar-
</p>
<p>tial writer. Private animosity and party feeling warped his judgment ;
</p>
<p>and it is frequently but too apparent, that we are listening not to the
</p>
<p>philosophic historian, but to the political partisan. He is too favourable
</p>
<p>to Caesar ; he is unjust towards Cicero ; and, although fond of display-
</p>
<p>ing his skill in drawing characters, he exercises none of it on the Roman
</p>
<p>orator. But to this we have already alluded. As for the preface to the
</p>
<p>work, it is, like that to the Jugurthine War, rather a compliment paid by
</p>
<p>the author to his own character and pursuits, than a pertinent introduc-
</p>
<p>tion to an historical narrative.
</p>
<p>H. With regard, Doctor, to the subject of that narrative, do you not
</p>
<p>think the picture of the conspiracy is somewhat overcharged, and that
</p>
<p>it was merely an effort, on the part of the lower orders, to break the
</p>
<p>chains imposed upon them by an odious and tyrannical aristocracy I
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Some persons, at the present day, are inclined to favour this

</p>
<p>opinion^ Henry, but I am afraid they are guided, in forming it, rather too
</p>
<p>much by their own private feelings and the political aspect of their own
</p>
<p>times. They appear to forget altogether the character of the leader in
</p>
<p>this nefarious undertaking, and do not perceive that, if his immediate
</p>
<p>followers were oppressed by any thing, it was by the heavy burden of
</p>
<p>their own vices. But of all this we will talk at some other time.

<p>xx LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SALLUST.
</p>
<p>Let us proceed to the Jugurthine war. Although not an eye-witness
</p>
<p>of this contest, yet Sallust's situation, as governor of Numidia, which
</p>
<p>seems to have suggested the composition, was favourable to the author-
</p>
<p>ity of the work, as it afforded him the means of collecting materials
</p>
<p>and procuring information.
</p>
<p>H. Do you think, Doctor, that his residence in Africa was of any
</p>
<p>advantage to him as regarded a knowledge of its earlier history 1
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Of none whatever. His account of the first settling of Africa
</p>
<p>is a mere fable, although he quotes in its behalf the Punic books of King
</p>
<p>Hiempsal, (referring probably to documents preserved in his archives.i)
</p>
<p>and the traditions of the inhabitants themselves. His geographical
</p>
<p>descriptions, however, if we except a few slight errors, are extremely
</p>
<p>valuable.  But to return to his account of the war. Sallust has been
</p>
<p>charged with partiality towards the character of Marius, and with giving,
</p>
<p>for the sake of his favourite leader, an unfair account of the massacre
</p>
<p>at Vaga. In this, however, I cannot concur ; and the best answer to
</p>
<p>the charge in question is the ample justice which he does to Metellus,
</p>
<p>in describing the war as almost brought to a close by him previous to
</p>
<p>the arrival of Marius. As a piece of composition, this narrative deserves
</p>
<p>to rank very highly, and the varying nature of the contest, the talents,
</p>
<p>the endless resources, the total want of principle, the sufferings of con-
</p>
<p>science, which are all found combined in the character of Jugurtha,
</p>
<p>stand forth in vivid and picturesque colours, and convey a moral lesson
</p>
<p>not easy to be effaced. i
</p>
<p>H. 1 have often dwelt upon that picture, Dr. Barton, and upon the
</p>
<p>miseries of suspicion and remorse which Jugurtha created for himself by
</p>
<p>his own atrocities ; and it has been often a question with me, whether
</p>
<p>he were not more wretched, on the throne, than in the dungeon where
</p>
<p>he terminated his miserable existence.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Let us pass now to the History of Sallust. This was a civil
</p>
<p>and military history of the republic, in five books, including a period,
</p>
<p>however, of only thirteen years, from the resignation of the dictatorship
</p>
<p>by Sylla, till the promulgation of the Manilian law. The period thus
</p>
<p>embraced was a short but momentous one ; Mithridates, in the East,

</p>
<p>displaying all the resources of his powerful gen'us against the Roman
</p>
<p>rule, and Sertorius, in the Weil, turning the arms of the republic against
</p>
<p>itself, while the bosom of Italy was the scene of a formidable commo-
</p>
<p>tion, excited by a host of gladiators and slaves. The work was intro-
</p>
<p>duced by two discourses, the one containing a delineation of the crovern-
</p>
<p>ment of Rome, and the habits and manners of its people, from the

</p>
<p>earliest period to the commencement of the civil wars ; the other
</p>
<p>giving a general view of the dissensions between Sylla and Marius. 1
</p>
<p>H. Why, Doctor, it must have connected the termination of the
</p>
<p>Jugurthine war with the commencement of Catiline's conspiracy. What
</p>
<p>a pity it has not come down to us.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. And the more so, too, since all the accounts of Roman his-
</p>
<p>tory which have been written are defective during the very period which
</p>
<p>it embraced. Nearly seven hundred fragments, belonging to it, have
</p>
<p>been collected from scholiasts and grammarians, by the President de
</p>
<p>Brosses, 2 but they are too short and unconnected to serve any valuable
</p>
<p>purpose. AVhen I say this, however, I mean to be understood as except-
</p>
<p>ing four orations and two letters, and a fragment giving a description
</p>
<p>of a splendid entertainment, with which Metellus was honoured on his
</p>
<p>return, after a year's absence, to his jovi rnment of Farther Spain. This
</p>
<p>work was the production of Sallusf s matured intellect, and the last
</p>
<p>which he composed. It was inscribed to Lucullus, the son of the cele-
</p>
<p>brated commander.
</p>
<p>H. Are there not, Doctor, two political discourses, concerning the
</p>
<p>administration of the government, in the form of letters to Julius Caesar,
</p>
<p>which are supposed to have been the productions of Salli.
</p>
<p>Dr. B. Thev are commonly ti. imposed by him,
</p>
<p>but the grounds of this opinion are far from satisfactory to one who
</p>
<p>exam with any attention. 3
</p>
<p>H. Many thanks to you, my dear Doctor, for your kindness in
</p>
<p>devoting so much of your valuable tune to this notice of Sallust and
</p>
<p>his writings. I I be able to profit by them in the prosecution
</p>
<p>of my print* :iid that it will be allowed me occasionally to con-
</p>
<p>sult you on other points of classical bi
</p>
<p>\\. You will always find DM ready, and willing, Henry, to co-
</p>
<p>operate in so praiseworthy an undertaking. God bless you, my dear
</p>
<p>i Income in after-life an honour to your friein
</p>
<p>an ornament to our common country : for the truest definition of happi-
</p>
<p>I, a cultivated intellect in unison with a virtuous heart.  Farewell.

<p>et fortunae bonorum, ut initium, finis est : omnia orta oc-

<p>cidunt, et aucta senescunt : animus incorruptus, aeter-
</p>
<p>nus, rector humani generis, x agit atque habet cuncta, ne-
</p>
<p>que ipse habetur. 2 Quo magis pravitas eorum admiranda
</p>
<p>est, qui, dediti corporis gaudiis, per luxum atque igna-
</p>
<p>viam aetatem agunt ; ceterum ingenium, quo neque me-
</p>
<p>lius, neque amplius aliud in natura mortalium est, 3 incul-

</p>
<p>tudo paratur.

</p>
<p>6 omnis cura rerum publicarum, minume mihi hac tempes-

</p>
<p>tur ; neque illi, quibus per fraudem jus fuit, tuti, aut eo
</p>
<p>magis honesti sunt. Nam vi quidem regere patriam, aut
</p>
<p>8 parentes, quamquam et possis, et 9 delicta corrigas, ta-
</p>
<p>men importunum est ; cum praesertim omnes rerum mu-

</p>
<p>tra autem niti, neque aliud 10 fatigando, nisi odium, quae-
</p>

</p>
<p>et perniciosa lubido tenet, potentiae paucorum decus at-

<p>multo Iabore, multaque cura, praeterea modestissume pa-
</p>
<p>rendo, et saepe obviam eundo periculis, in tantam claritu-

<p>dinem brevi pervenerat, ut nostris vehementer carus,

<p>Numantmis maxumo terrori esset. Ac sane, quod diffi-

<p>ex audacia temeritatera adferre plerumque solet. Igitur

</p>
<p>quippe cujus neque consilium, neque inceptum ullura

<p>frustra erat. Hue accedebat 3 munincentia animi, et in-

</p>
<p>VIII. Ea tempestate in exercitu nostro fuere complu-
</p>
<p>res, novi atque nobiles, quibus divitiae bono honestoque
</p>
<p>4 potiores erant, factiosi, doini potentes, apud socios clari

</p>
<p>Sed postquam, Numantia deleta, P. Scipio dimittere aux-

<p>turn magniiice pro concione Jugurtham in praetorium
</p>
<p>abduxit, ibique secreto monuit, " uti potius 8 publice, quam

<p>cognovit, cum virtute viri, turn gratia permotus, rlexit
</p>
<p>animum suum, et Jugurtham beneficiis vincere adgressus
</p>
<p>est ; statimque adoptavit, et testamento pariter cum filiis
</p>
<p>heredem instituit. Sed ipse paucos post annos, morbo
</p>
<p>atque aetate confectus, cum sibi finem vitae adesse intel-

<p>legeret, coram amicis et cognatis, item Adherbale et
</p>
<p>Hiempsale filiis, dicitur hujuscemodi verba 1 cum Jugur-

</p>
<p>X. " Parvum ego, Jugurtha, te, amisso patre, sine spe,
</p>
<p>sine opibus, 2 in meum regnum accepi ; existumans non
</p>
<p>minus me tibi quam liberis, si genuissem, ob beneficia
</p>
<p>carum fore : 3 neque ea res falsum habuit. Nam, ut alia
</p>
<p>magna et egregia tua omittam, novissume, rediens Nu-
</p>
<p>mantia, meque regnumque meum 4 gloria honoravisti : tua
</p>
<p>virtute nobis Romanos ex amicis amicissumos fecisti : in
</p>
<p>Hispania nomen familiae renovatum : postremo, quod diffi-
</p>
<p>cillumum inter mortalis, gloria invidiam vicisti. Nunc,
</p>
<p>quoniam mihi natura vitae finem facit, per hanc dextram,
</p>
<p>Sper regni fidem moneo obtestorque, uti hos, qui tibi
</p>
<p>genere propinqui, beneficio meo fratres sunt, caros habeas ;
</p>
<p>neu malis alienos adjungere, quam sanguine conjunctos
</p>
<p>retinere. 6 Non exercitus, neque thesauri praesidia regni
</p>
<p>sunt, verum amici, quos neque armis cogere, neque auro
</p>
<p>parare queas : officio et fide pariuntur. Quis autem
</p>
<p>amicior, quam frater fratri ? aut quern alienum fidum in*
</p>
<p>venies, si tuis hostis fueris ? Equidem ego vobis regnum
</p>
<p>trado firmum, si boni eritis ; sin mali, imbecillum. Nam
</p>
<p>concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maxumae 7 dila-
</p>
<p>buntur. Ceterum ante hos te, Jugurtha, qui aetate et
</p>
<p>sapientia prior es, 8 ne aliter quid eveniat, providere
</p>
<p>decet. Nam, in omni certamine, qui opulentior est,
</p>
<p>etiamsi accipit injuriam, quia plus potest, facere videtur.

</p>
<p>tellegebat, et ipse longe aUter animo agitabat, tamen pro

<p>SALLUSTII JUGURTHA. 7
</p>
<p>tempore benigne respondit. Micipsa paucis diebus mo-
</p>
<p>ritur. Postquam illi, more regio, x justa magnifice fece-
</p>
<p>rant, reguli in unum convenere, uti inter se de cunctis
</p>
<p>negotiis disceptarent. Sed Hiempsal, qui minumus ex
</p>
<p>illis, natura 2 ferox, etiam ante a ignobilitatem Jugurthae,
</p>
<p>quia materno genere impar erat, despiciens, 3 dextra Ad-
</p>
<p>herbalem adsedit ; ne medius ex tribus, quod apud Nu-
</p>
<p>midas honori ducitur, Jugurtha foret. Dein tamen, uti
</p>
<p>aetati concederet, fatigatus a fratre, vix in partem alteram
</p>
<p>transductus est. Ibi, 4 cum multa de administrando imperio
</p>
<p>dissererent, Jugurtha inter alias res jacit : oportere
</p>
<p>QUINQUENNII CONSULTA OMNIA ET DECRETA RESCINDI ;
</p>
<p>NAM PER EA TEMPORA CONFECTUM ANNIS MICIPSAM PARUM
</p>
<p>ANIMO VALUISSE. TuM IDEM, Hiempsal, PLACERE SIBI,
</p>
<p>respondit ; nam 5 ipsum ileum tribus his proxumis an-
</p>
<p>NIS ADOPTATIONE IN REGNUM PERVENISSE. Quod Verbum
</p>
<p>in pectus Jugurthae altius, quam quisquam ratus, descen-
</p>
<p>dit. Itaque, ex eo tempore, ira et metu anxius moliri, pa-
</p>
<p>rare atque ea modo animo habere, quibus Hiempsal per
</p>
<p>dolum caperetur. Quae ubi tardius procedunt, neque leni-
</p>
<p>' tur animus ferox, statuit quo vis modo inceptum perficere.
</p>
<p>XII. Primo conventu, quern ab regulis factum supra

</p>
<p>referunt.
</p>
<p>XIIL Ceterum fama tanti facinoris per omnem Africam
</p>
<p>brevi divulgatur : Adherbalem 1 omnisque, qui sub imperio
</p>
<p>Micipsae fuerant, metus invadit : in duas partis disce-
</p>
<p>dunt : plures Adherbalem sequuntur, sed ilium alterum
</p>
<p>bello meliores. Igitur Jugurtha quam maxumas potest
</p>
<p>copias armat ; urbis 2 partim vi, alias voluntate imperio
</p>
<p>suo adjungit ; omni Numidiae imperare parat. Adherbal,
</p>
<p>3 tamen etsi Romam legatos miserat, qui senatum doce-
</p>
<p>rent de caede fratris et fortunis suis ; tamen, fretus mul-
</p>
<p>titudine militum, parabat armis contendere. Sed, ubi res
</p>
<p>ad certamen vcnit, victus ex praelio profugit in 4 pro\in-
</p>
<p>ciam, ac deinde Romam contendit. Turn Jugurtha, 5 pa-
</p>
<p>tratis consiliis, in otio facinus suum cum animo reputans,
</p>
<p>timere populum Romanum, neque advorsus iram ejus
</p>
<p>usquam, nisi in avaritia nobilitatis et pecunia sua, spem
</p>
<p>habere. Itaque paucis diebus cum auro et argento multo
</p>
<p>Romam mittit, 6 quis praecepit, uti primum veteres amicos
</p>
<p>muneribus expleant ; deinde novos adquirant ; postremo,
</p>
<p>quemcumque possint largiundo parare, ne cunctentur.
</p>
<p>Sed, ubi Romam legati venere, et, ex praecepto regis,
</p>
<p>hospitibus, 7 aliisque, quorum ea tempestate auctoritas pol-
</p>
<p>lebat, magna munera misere ; tanta commutatio incessit,
</p>
<p>uti ex maxuma invidia in gratiam et favorem nobilitatis
</p>
<p>Jugurtha veniret ; quorum pars spe, alii praemio inducti,
</p>
<p>8 singulos ex senatu ambiundo, nitebantur, ne gravius in
</p>
<p>eum consuleretur. Igitur, legati ubi satis conndunt, die
</p>
<p>constituto, 9 senatus utrisque datur. Turn Adherbalem hoc

<p>calorem, aut asperitatem, item solitudines, minus frequen-

<p>cetera quam paucissumis absolvam. In divisione orbis
</p>
<p>terrae plerique 2 in partem tertiam Africam posuere :
</p>
<p>pauci tantummodo Asiam et Europam esse ; sed Africam
</p>
<p>in Europa. 3 Ea finis habet, ab occidente 4 fretum nostri
</p>
<p>maris et oceani ; ab ortu solis, 5 declivem latitudinem,
</p>
<p>quern locum Catabathmon incolae adpellant. Mare sae-
</p>
<p>vum. importuosum : ager frugum fertilis, bonus pecori,
</p>
<p>6 arbori infecundus : coelo, terra, penuria aquarum. Genus
</p>
<p>hominum salubri corpore, velox, patiens laborum : ple-
</p>
<p>rosque senectus dissolvit, nisi qui ferro, aut bestiis in-
</p>
<p>teriere : nam morbus haud saepe quemquam superat.
</p>
<p>Ad hoc, malefici generis plurima animalia. Sed qui
</p>
<p>mortales initio Africam habuerint, quique postea accesse-
</p>
<p>rint, aut quomodo inter se permixti sint ; 7 quamquam ab
</p>
<p>ea fama, quae plerosque obtinet, diver sum est ; tamen,
</p>
<p>uti ex libris Punicis, qui regis Hiempsalis dicebantur,
</p>
<p>interpretatum nobis est, utique rem sese habere cultores
</p>
<p>ejus terrae putant, quam paucissumis dicam. Ceterum

<p>adhuc aedificia Numidarum agrestium, quae 2 mapalia illi

<p>(nam hi propius mare Africum agitabant ; Gaetuli 4 sub

</p>
<p>quia Libyes, quam Gaetuli, minus bellicosi : denique

</p>
<p>Numantiam acceperat, omnia Romae venalia esse, simul
</p>
<p>et illorum pollicitationibus accensus, quos paullo ante
</p>
<p>muneribus expleverat, in regnum Adherbalis animum
</p>
<p>intendit. Ipse acer, bellicosus : at is, 3 quem petebat,
</p>
<p>quietus, imbellis, placido ingenio, opportunus injuriae, me-
</p>
<p>tuens magis, quam metuendus. Igitur ex improviso, finis
</p>
<p>ejus cum magna manu invasit, multos mortalis cum pecore
</p>
<p>atque alia praeda capit, aedificia incendit, pleraque loca
</p>
<p>hostiliter cum equitatu ace edit ; dein cum omni multitu-
</p>
<p>dine in regrmm snum 4 convertit, existumans dolore per-
</p>
<p>motum Adherbalem injurias suas manu vindicaturum,
</p>
<p>eamque rem belli caussam fore. At ille, quod neque se

<p>parein armis existumabat, et amicitia populi Romani ma-

<p>gis quam Numidis fretus erat, legatos ad Jugurtham de
</p>
<p>injuriis questum misit : qui tametsi 5 contumeliosa dicta

</p>
<p>haud longe a mari, prope Cirtam oppidum, utriusque
</p>
<p>consedit exercitus : et, quia die extremum erat, praelium
</p>
<p>non inceptum. Ubi pleruraque noctis processit, ^bscuro
</p>
<p>etiam turn lumine, milites Jugurthini, signo dato, castra
</p>
<p>hostium invadunt ; semisomnos partim, alios arma su-
</p>
<p>mentes fugant funduntque ; Adherbal cum paucis equiti-
</p>
<p>bus Cirtam profugit, et, ni multitudo togatorum fuisset,
</p>
<p>quae Numidas insequentes moenibus prohibuit, uno die
</p>
<p>inter duos reges coeptum atque patratum bellum foret.
</p>
<p>Igitur Jugurtha oppidum circumsedit, 2 vineis turribusque et
</p>
<p>machinis omnium generum expugnare adgreditur ; maxume
</p>
<p>festinans 3 tempus legatorum antecapere, quos, ante prae-
</p>
<p>lium factum, Romam ab Adherbale missos audiverat. Sed,
</p>
<p>postquam senatus de bello eorum accepit, tres ado-
</p>
<p>lescentes in Africam legantur, qui ambo reges adeant, se-
</p>
<p>natus populique Romani verbis nunci Ik et censere,
</p>
<p>eos ab armis discedere ; de controversiis suis jure potius,
</p>
<p>quam bello disceptare ; ita seque illisque dignum fore."
</p>
<p>XXII. Legati in Africam maturantes veniunt, eo magis,
</p>
<p>quod Romae, dam profirisci parant, de pntfilio facto et op-
</p>
<p>pugnatione Cirtae audiebatur : sed is rumor 5 clemens erat.
</p>
<p>Quorum Jugurtha accepta oratione respondit : M sibi
</p>
<p>neque majus quidquam, neque carius auctoritate senati :
</p>
<p>ab adolescentia ita enisum, uti ab optumo quoque probare-
</p>
<p>tur : virtute, non malitia, P. Scipioni, summo viro, pla-
</p>
<p>cuisse : ob easdem artis ab Micipsa, non penuria libero-
</p>
<p>rum, in regnum adoptatum : ceterum, quo plura bene atque
</p>
<p>strenue fecisset, eo animum suum injuria m minus tolerare :
</p>
<p>Adherbalem dobs vitae suae insidiatum ; quod ubi com-
</p>
<p>perisset, sceleri obviam isse : populum Romanum ^eque
</p>
<p>recte, neque pro bono facturum, si ab jure gentium
</p>
<p>prohibuerint : postremo de omnibus rebus legatos Romam
</p>
<p>brevi missurum." Ita 7 utrique digredimitur. Adherbahs

<p>XXIV. Numidae paucis diebus jussa efficiunt : lit-
</p>
<p>terae Adherbalis in senatu 4 recitatae, quarum sententia haeo
</p>
<p>fuit. u Non mea culpa saepe ad vos oratum mitto, Patres
</p>
<p>conscripti, sed vis Jugurthae subigit : quern tanta lubido
</p>
<p>exstinguendi me invasit, uti 5 neque vos, neque deos im-
</p>
<p>mortalis in animo habeat ; sanguinem meum, quam omnia,
</p>
<p>malit. Itaque quintum jam mensem, socius et amicus
</p>
<p>populi Romani, armis obsessus teneor : neque mini Mi-,
</p>
<p>cipsae paths beneficia, neque vestra decreta auxiliantur :
</p>
<p>ferro, an fame acrius urguear, incertus sum. 6 Plura de
</p>
<p>Jugurtha scribere dehortatur fortuna mea : etiam antea
</p>
<p>expertus sum, parum fidei miseris esse : 7 nisi tamen, intel-
</p>
<p>lego, ilium supra, quam ego sum, petere, neque simul ami-
</p>
<p>citiam vestram, et regnum meum sperare : utrum 8 gravius
</p>
<p>existumet, nemini occultum est. Nam initio occidit Hi-
</p>
<p>empsalem, fratrem meum ; dein patrio regno me expulit : 
</p>
<p>9 quae sane fuerint nostrae injuriae, nihil ad vos. Verum
</p>
<p>nunc vestrum regnum armis tenet : me, quern imperatorem
</p>
<p>Numidis posuistis, clausum obsidet ; legatormn verba
</p>
<p>quanti fecerit, pericula mea declarant. 10 Quid reliquum,

<p>Africam mittendum censerent, et quam primum Adherbali
</p>
<p>subveniundum ; x de Jugurtha interim uti consuleretur,
</p>
<p>quoniam non paruisset legatis. Sed ab isdem regis fau-

<p>toribus summa ope enismn, ne decretum fieret. Ita bonum
</p>
<p>publicum, ut in plerisque negotiis solet, privata gratia
</p>
<p>devictum. Legantur tamen in Africam majores natu,
</p>
<p>nobiles, 2 amplis honoribus ; in quis M. Scaurus, de quo
</p>
<p>supra memoravimus, consularis, et turn senati princeps.
</p>
<p>Hi, quod 3 in invidia res erat, simul et ab Numidis obse-
</p>

<p>litteras ad Jugurtham mittunt, quam ocissume ad provin-

<p>ubi accepit, homines claros, quorum auctoritatem Romae
</p>
<p>pollere audiverat, 4 contra inceptum suum venisse ; primo
</p>
<p>commotus, metu atque lubidine divorsus agitabatur. Time-
</p>
<p>bat iram senati, ni paruisset legatis ; porro animus
</p>
<p>cupidine caecus ad inceptum scelus rapiebat. Yicit
</p>
<p>tamen in avido ingenio pravum consilium. Igitur, exer-
</p>
<p>citu circumdato, summa vi Cirtam irrumpere nititur,
</p>
<p>maxume sperans, diducta manu hostium, aut vi, aut dolis,
</p>
<p>sese casum victoriae inventurum. Quod ubi secus pro-
</p>
<p>cedit, neque, quod intenderat, efncere potest, uti prius r

<p>quam legatos 5 conveniret, Adherbalis potiretur : ne, amplius
</p>
<p>morando, Scaurum, quern plurimum metuebat, incenderet,
</p>
<p>cum paucis equitibus in provinciam venit. Ac, tamen etsi
</p>
<p>senati verbis minae graves nunciabantur, quod oppugna-
</p>
<p>tione non desisteret, multa tamen oratione consumta,
</p>
<p>legati frustra discessere.

<p>potestas erat, ita, uti censuerant Italici, deditionem facit.

<p>Jugurtha in primis Adherbalem excruciatum necat : dein
</p>
<p>omnis puberes, Numidas et negotiatores promiscue, uti

<p>quisque armatis obvius, interfecit.

<p>senatus delicti conscientia populum timet, 6 lege Sempro-

<p>obvenit : deinde exercitus, qui in Africam portaretur, scri-

<p>XXVIII. At Jugurtha, contra spem nuncio accepto,
</p>
<p>quippe cui Romae omnia 7 venum ire in animo haeserat ;
</p>
<p>rilium, et cum eo duo familiaris, ad senatum legatos

<p>atque mirabile faciims duorum Carthaginiensium ' memo-
</p>
<p>rare : earn rem locus admonuit. Qua tempestate Car-
</p>
<p>thaginienses ^leraeque Africae imperitabant, Cyrenenses
</p>
<p>quoque magni atque opulenti fuere. Ager in medio
</p>
<p>arenosus, una specie : neque fTumen, neque mons erat,
</p>
<p>qui finis eorum discerneret ; quae res eos in magno
</p>
<p>diuturno bello inter se habuit. Postquam utrimque
</p>
<p>2 legiones, item classes fusae fugataeque, et alteri alteros
</p>
<p>aliquantum adtriverant ; veriti, ne mox victos victoresque
</p>
<p>defessos alius adgrederetur, 3 per inducias sponsionem
</p>
<p>faciunt, " uti certo die legati domo proficiscerentur ; quo
</p>
<p>in loco inter se obvii fuissent, is communis utriusque
</p>
<p>populi finis haberetur." Igitur Carthagine duo fratres
</p>
<p>missi, 4 quibus nomen Philaenis erat, maturavere iter
</p>
<p>pergere : Cyrenenses tardius iere. Id secordiane, an
</p>
<p>casu accident, parum cognovi. Ceterum solet in illis
</p>
<p>locis tempestas haud secus, atque in mari, retinere. Nam
</p>
<p>ubi, per loca aequalia et 5 nuda gignentium, ventus coortus
</p>
<p>arenam humo excitavit, ea, magna vi agitata, ora oculos-
</p>
<p>que implere solet ; ita prospectu impedito, b morari iter.
</p>
<p>Postquam Cyrenenses aliquanto posteriores se vident, et
</p>
<p>7 ob rem corruptam domi poenas metuunt ; criminari,
</p>
<p>Carthaginienses ante tempus domo digressos, conturbare
</p>
<p>rem: denique omnia malle, quam vied abire. Sed cum

<p>Poeni aliam conditionem, tantummodo aequam, peter ent,
</p>

<p>quos finis populo suo peterent, ibi vivi obruerentur ; vel
</p>
<p>eadem conditione sese, quern in locum vellent, proces-

<p>*Ita ad hoc aetatis a pueritia fui, ut omnis labores, pe-
</p>
<p>ricula consueta habeam. Quae 2 ante vestra beneficia
</p>
<p>gratuito faciebam, ea uti, accepta mercede, deseram, non
</p>
<p>est consilium, Quirites. Illis difficile est 3 in potestatibus
</p>
<p>temperare, qui per ambitionem sese probos simulavere :
</p>
<p>mihi, qui omnem aetatem in optumis artibus egi, bene-
</p>
<p>facere jam ex consuetudine in naturam vertit. Bellum
</p>
<p>me gerere cum Jugurtha jussistis ; quam rem nobilitas

<p>num id mutare melius sit, si quem 4 ex illo globo nobil-

</p>
<p>Ita plerumque evenit, ut, quem vos imperare jussistis, is
</p>
<p>imperatorem alium quaerat. Ac ego scio, Quirites, qui
</p>
<p>postquam consules facti sunt, acta majorum, et Graeco-

<p>rum militaria praecepta legere coeperint ; 7 homines prae-
</p>

<p>re atque usu prius est. Comparate nunc, Quirites,
</p>
<p>cum illorum superbia me hominem novum. Quae illi

<p>sumas res pariter exspectant, Hgnaviae voluptatem, et

</p>
<p>tollunt : eorum fortia facta memorando clariores sese pu-
</p>
<p>tant ; 2 quod contra est. Nam quanto vita illorum praecla-
</p>
<p>rior, tanto horum secordia flagitiosior. Et profecto ita
</p>
<p>se res habet : majorum gloria 3 posteris lumen est, neque
</p>
<p>bona neque mala in occulto patitur. Hujusce rei ego
</p>
<p>inopiam patior, Quirites ; verum id, quod multo praecla-
</p>
<p>rius est, meamet facta mihi dicere licet. Nunc videte,
</p>
<p>quam iniqui sint. Quod 4 ex aliena virtute sibi adrogant,
</p>
<p>id mihi ex me a non concedunt : scilicet, quia imagines
</p>
<p>non habeo, et quia mihi nova nobilitas est ; quam certe
</p>
<p>peperisse melius est, quam acceptam corrupisse. Equi-
</p>
<p>dem ego non ignoro, si jam respondere velint, 5 abunde

<p>maxumo vestro beneficio, cum omnibus locis me vosque

<p>maledictis lacerent, non placuit reticere, ue quis modes-

<p>Marius impigre prudenterque suorum et hostium res pari-

<p>esset : explorare itinera regum, consilia et insidias ante-

</p>
<p>praedam agentes, saepe adgressus itinere fuderat, ipsum-

<p>3 usum belli, turn quia res aspera videbatur ; et Metellus
</p>
<p>oppidum Thalam magna gloria ceperat, haud dissimiliter

</p>
<p>a moenibus aliquot fontes erant, Capsenses una modo,
</p>
<p>atque ea intra oppidum, 4 jugi aqua, cetera pluvia utebantur.
</p>
<p>Id ibique, et 5 in omni Africa, quae procul a mari incul-
</p>

</p>
<p>rumque lacte et ferina came vescebantur, neque 6 salem,
</p>
<p>neque alia irritamenta gulae quaerebant ; cibus 7 illis advor-

</p>
<p>lucis adventum, pervenit in locum tumulosum, ab Capsa
</p>
<p>non amplius duum millium inter vallo ; ibique, quam occul-
</p>
<p>tissume potest, cum omnibus copiis opperitur. Sed, ubi
</p>
<p>dies coepit, et Numidae, nihil hostile metuentes, multi
</p>
<p>oppido egressi ; repente omnem equitatum, et cum his
</p>
<p>velocissumos pedites cursu tendere ad Capsam, et portas
</p>
<p>obsidere jubet : deinde ipse intentus propere sequi, ne-
</p>
<p>que milites praedari sinere. Quae postquam oppidani
</p>

</p>
<p>visum, ad hoc pars civium extra moenia in hostium po-
</p>

</p>
<p>dum incensum : Numidae puberes interfecti ; alii omnes
</p>
<p>venum dati : praeda militibus divisa. 3 Id facinus contra
</p>
<p>jus belli, non avaritia, neque scelere consulis admissum ;
</p>
<p>sed quia locus Jugurthae opportunus, nobis aditu difficilis,
</p>
<p>genus hominum mobile, infidum, neque bencficio, neque
</p>
<p>metu coercitum.
</p>
<p>XCII. Postquam tantam rem Marius, sine ullo suo-
</p>
<p>rum incommodo patravit ; magnus et clarus antea, major
</p>
<p>et clarior haberi coepit. 4 Omnia, non bene consulta
</p>
<p>modo, verum etiam casu data, in virtutem trahebantur :
</p>
<p>milites, 5 modesto imperio habiti simul, et locupletes, ad

<p>consul, ubi ea res bene evenit, ad alia oppida pergit :

</p>
<p>ter Capsensium miserias, igni corrumpit : luctu atque

<p>patens, in immensum editus, uno perangusto aditu relicto :
</p>
<p>nam 1 omnis natura, velut opere atque consulto, praeceps.
</p>
<p>Quem locum Marius, quod ibi regis thesauri erant, sum-
</p>
<p>ma vi capere intendit. Sed ea res forte, quam consilio,
</p>
<p>melius gesta. Nam castello virorum atque armorum sa-
</p>
<p>tis, magna vis frumenti et fons aquae ; aggeribus turri-
</p>
<p>busque et aliis machinationibus locus 2 importunus : iter
</p>
<p>castellanorum angustum admodum, utrimque praecisum.
</p>
<p>Vineae cum ingenti periculo frustra agitabantur : nam,
</p>
<p>cum eae paullum processerant, igni, aut lapidibus cor-
</p>
<p>rumpebantur ; milites neque 3 pro opere consistere, propter
</p>
<p>iniquitatem loci, neque intra vineas sine periculo 4 ad-
</p>
<p>ministrare : optumus quisque cadere, aut sauciari ; ceteris
</p>
<p>metus augeri.
</p>
<p>XCIII. At Marius, multis diebus et laboribus consumtis,
</p>
<p>5 anxius trahere cum animo, omitteretne inceptum quo-
</p>

</p>
<p>agitaret, forte quidam Ligus, ex cohortibus auxiliariis
</p>
<p>miles gregarius, castris aquatum egressus, haud procul
</p>
<p>ab latere castelli, quod 7 avorsum praeliantibus erat, ani-
</p>

<p>unam atque alteram, dein plures peteret, studio legundi

</p>
<p>cum magno equitatu in castra venit ; quos uti ex Latio et

</p>
<p>que locos munitos et sibi utilis simul, et ^nagnam pecu-
</p>

</p>
<p>simul gladium sanguine oblitum ostendere, quern in pugna,

<p>ubi milites accipere, magis 5 atrocitate rei, quam fide
</p>
<p>nuncii terrentur : simulque barbari animos toller e, et in
</p>
<p>perculsos acrius incedere. Jamque paullum ab fuga
</p>
<p>aberant, cum Sulla, profligatis, quos advorsum ierat,
</p>
<p>Mauris ab latere incurrit. Bocchus statim avortitur. At
</p>
<p>Jugurtha, dum sustentare suos, et prope jam 6 adeptam
</p>
<p>victoriam retinere cupit, circumventus ab equitibus, dextra,
</p>
<p>sinistra, omnibus occisis, solus inter tela hostium vitabun-
</p>
<p>dus erumpit. Atque interim Marius, fugatis equitibus,
</p>
<p>occurrit auxilio suis, quos pelli jam acceperat. Denique
</p>
<p>hostes undique fusi. Turn spectaculum horribile campis

<p>facundiae, non aetati a Manlio concessum, pauca verba
</p>
<p>hujuscemodi locutus. " Rex Bocche, magna nobis laetitia,

</p>
<p>imperitare. Tibi vero nulla opportunior nostra amicitia ;

<p>5 gratia par, ac si prope adessemus ; dein, quod 6 parentes
</p>
<p>abunde habemus, amicorum neque nobis, neque cuiquam

<p>omnium satis. Atque hoc utinam a principio tibi placuis-
</p>
<p>set ! profecto ex populo Romano ad hoc tempus multo
</p>
<p>plura bona accepisses, quam mala perpessus es. Sed,
</p>
<p>quoniam humanarum rerum fortuna pleraque regit, 7 cui

<p>scilicet placuit te et vim et gratiam nostram experiri ;

<p>nigne ; simul pauca 9 pro delicto verba facit : " se non hostili

</p>
<p>Igitur quaestori mandata Bocchi patefaciunt : simul ab eo

</p>
<p>petivit, uti Sullam ad se mitteret ; 1 cujus arbitratu de

<p>communibus negotiis cousuleretur. Is missus cum prae-
</p>
<p>sidio equitum atque peditum, 2 item funditorum Balearium :

<p>armis, itineris properandi caussa : neque his secus, atque
</p>
<p>aliis armis, advorsum tela hostium, quod 5 ea levia sunt,
</p>
<p>muniti. Sed itinere, quinto denique die, Volux, filius
</p>
<p>Bocchi, repente in campis patentibus cum mille non
</p>
<p>amplius equitibus sese ostendit : qui 6 temere et effuse
</p>
<p>euntes, Sullae aliisque omnibus et numerum ampliorem
</p>
<p>vero, et hostilem metum emciebant. Igitur sese quisque
</p>
<p>7 expedire, arma atque tela 8 tentare, intendere : timor ali-
</p>
<p>quantus ; sed spes amplior, quippe victoribus, et advorsum
</p>
<p>eos, quos saepe vicerant. Interim equites, exploratum
</p>
<p>praemissi, 9 rem, uti erat, quietam nunciant.
</p>
<p>CVI. Volux adveniens quaestorem adpellat : "se a
</p>
<p>patre Boccho 10 obviam illis simul, et praesidio missum."
</p>
<p>Deinde eum et proxumum diem sine metu conjuncti eunt.
</p>
<p>Post, ubi castra locata, et die vesper erat, repente Mau-
</p>
<p>rus 1] incerto voltu ad Sullam adcurrit : " sibi ex specula-

<p>ab injuria Maurum 3 prohibet : suos hortatur, " uti fortem

</p>
<p>ceret, maxumum Jovem obtestatus, ut sceleris atque per-
</p>
<p>fidiae Bocchi testis adesset, castris abire jubet. Ille lacru-
</p>
<p>mans orare, " ne ea crederet : nihil dolo factum, magis cal-

<p>illo die responsurum : deinde ambo 7 in sua castra digressi.
</p>
<p>Sed, ubi plerumque noctis processit, Sulla a Boccho

<p>adhibentur : praeterea Dabar 8 internuncius, sanctus vir et

<p>BELLUM C AT I L I N AR I U M .
</p>
<p>I. 2 0mnis homines, qui sese student praestare ceteris
</p>
<p>animalibus, summa ope niti decet vitam 2 silentio ne trans-
</p>
<p>eant, veluti pecora, quae natura 3 prona, atque ventri obe-
</p>
<p>dientia, finxit. Sed nostra omnis vis in animo et corpore
</p>
<p>sita : 4 animi imperio, corporis servitio, magis utimur : al-
</p>
<p>teram nobis cum dis, alteram cum belluis commune est,
</p>
<p>5 Quo mihi rectius videtur ingenii quam virium opibus
</p>
<p>gloriam quaerere ; et, quoniam vita ipsa, qua fruimur,
</p>
<p>brevis est, 6 memoriam nostri quam maxume longam effi--
</p>
<p>cere. Nam divitiaram et formae gloria fluxa atque fragi-
</p>
<p>lis ; virtus clara aeternaque 7 habetur. 8 Sed diu magnum
</p>
<p>inter mortalis certamen fuit, vine corporis an virtute
</p>
<p>animi, res militaris magis procederet. Nam et prius,
</p>
<p>quam incipias, 9 consulto ; et, ubi consulueris, mature facto
</p>
<p>opus est. Ita utrumque, per se indigens, alteram alterius
</p>
<p>auxilio eget,
</p>
<p>II. Igitur initio reges (nam in terris nomen 10 imperii
</p>
<p>id primum fuit) diversi, pars ingenium, alii corpus exer-

<p>80 SALLUSTII CATILINA.
</p>
<p>pertum est, in bello plurimum ingenium posse, x Quod si
</p>
<p>regum atque imperatorum animi virtus in pace ita, uti in
</p>
<p>bello, valeret, aequabilius atque constantius sese res
</p>
<p>humanae haberent ; neque 2 aliud alio ferri, neque mutari
</p>
<p>ac misceri omnia cerneres. Nam imperium facile his
</p>
<p>artibus retinetur, quibus initio partum est. Verum, ubi
</p>
<p>3 pro labore desidia, pro continentia et aequitate lubido
</p>
<p>atque superbia invasere, fortuna simul cum moribus im-
</p>
<p>mutatur. Ita imperium semper ad 4 optumum quemque a
</p>
<p>minus bono transfertur. Quae homines arant, navigant,
</p>
<p>aedificant, virtuti omnia parent. Sed multi mortales,
</p>
<p>dediti ventri atque somno, indocti incultique vitam, sicuti
</p>
<p>5 peregrinantes, transegere ; 6 quibus, profecto contra naturam,
</p>
<p>corpus voluptati, anima oneri fuit. Eorum ego vitam
</p>
<p>mortemque juxta aestumo, quoniam de utraque siletur.
</p>
<p>Verum enim vero is demum mihi vivere atque 7 frui anima
</p>
<p>videtur, qui, aliquo negotio intentus, praeclari facinoris,
</p>
<p>aut artis bonae famam quaerit. Sed, 8 in magna copia
</p>
<p>rerum, aliud alii natura iter ostendit. *
</p>
<p>III. Pulchrum est bene facere reipublicae : etiam 9 bene
</p>
<p>dicere haud absurdum est. Vel pace, vel bello, clarum
</p>
<p>fieri licet; 10 et qui fecere, et qui facta aliorum scripsere r
</p>
<p>multi laudantur. Ac mihi quidem, tamen etsi haud-
</p>
<p>quaquam par gloria sequatur scriptorem et 11 auctorem
</p>
<p>rerum, tamen in primis arduum videtur res gestas scri-
</p>
<p>bere : primum, quod facta dictis sunt exaequanda : de-
</p>
<p>hinc, quia plerique, quae delicta reprehenderis, malivo-
</p>
<p>lentia et invidia 12 putant : 13 ubi de magna virtute et gloria
</p>
<p>bonorum memores, quae sibi quisque facilia factu putat,
</p>
<p>aequo animo accipit ; 14 supra ea, veluti ficta, pro falsis
</p>
<p>ducit. Sed ego adolescentulus, initio, sicuti plerique,
</p>
<p>15 studio ad rempublicam latus sum ; ibique mihi advorsa
</p>
<p>multa fuere. Nam pro pudore, pro abstinentia, pro vir-
</p>
<p>tute, audacia, largitio, avaritia, vigebant. Quae tametsi

</p>
<p>tirem, nihilo minus honoris cupido eadem, quae ceteros,
</p>
<p>fama atque invidia vexabat.
</p>
<p>IV. Igitur, ubi animus 2 ex multis miseriis atque peri-
</p>
<p>eulis requievit, et mihi reliquam aetatem a republica pro-
</p>
<p>cul habendam decrevi, non fuit consilium, secordia atque
</p>
<p>desidia 2 bonum otium conterere ; neque vero agrum co-
</p>
<p>lendo, aut venando, servilibus officiis intentum, aetatem
</p>
<p>agere : sed, a quo incepto 3 studio me ambitio mala deti-
</p>
<p>nuerat, eodem regressus, statui res gestas populi Romani
</p>
<p>4 carptim, ut quaeque memoria digna videbantur, perscri-
</p>
<p>bere : eo magis, quod mihi a spe, metu, 5 partibus reipubli-
</p>
<p>cae animus liber erat. Igitur de Catilinae conjuratione,
</p>
<p>quam verissume potero, 6 paucis absolvam : nam id facinus
</p>
<p>in primis ego memorabile existumo, sceleris atque periculi
</p>
<p>novitate. De cujus hominis moribus pauca prius expla-
</p>
<p>nanda sunt, quam initium narrandi faciam.
</p>
<p>V. Lucius Catilina, 7 nobili genere natus, magna vi
</p>
<p>et animi et corporis, 8 sed ingenio malo pravoque. Huic
</p>
<p>ab adolescentia bella intestina, caedes, rapinae, discordia
</p>
<p>civilis, grata fuere ; 9 ibique juventutem suam exercuit.
</p>
<p>Corpus 10 patiens inediae, vigiliae, algoris, supra quam
</p>
<p>cuique credibile est : animus audax, subdolus, n varius,
</p>
<p>cujus rei libet 12 simulator ac dissimulator : alieni appe-
</p>
<p>tens, sui profusus, ardens in cupiditatibus : 13 satis loquen-
</p>
<p>tiae, sapientiae parum. u Vastus animus immoderata,
</p>
<p>incredibilia, nimis alta semper cupiebat. Hunc, ]5 post
</p>
<p>dominationem 16 Lucii Sullae, lubido maxuma invaserat
</p>
<p>17 reipublicae capiundae ; neque id quibus modis adseque-
</p>
<p>retur, dum sibi regnum pararet, quidquam pensi habebat.
</p>
<p>18 Agitabatur magis magisque in dies animus ferox, inopia
</p>
<p>rei familiaris, et conscientia scelerum ; quae utraque his
</p>
<p>artibus auxerat, quas supra memoravi. Incitabant prae-
</p>
<p>terea corrupti civitatis mores, quos pessuma ac diversa
</p>
<p>inter se mala, luxuria atque avaritia, vexabant. 19 Res

</p>
<p>admonuit, supra repetere, ac, paucis, instituta majorum

<p>domi militiaeque ; quomodo rempublicam habuerint, quan-
</p>
<p>82 SALLUSTII CATILINA.
</p>
<p>tamque reliquerint ; ut, paullatim immutata, ex pulcher-
</p>
<p>ruma, pessuma ac flagitiosissuma facta sit, disserere.
</p>
<p>VI. Urbem Romam, 1 sicuti ego accepi, condidere
</p>
<p>atque habuere initio 2 Trojani, qui, Aenea duce, profugi,
</p>
<p>sedibus incertis vagabantur ; cumque his 3 Aborigines,
</p>
<p>genus hominum agreste, sine legibus, 4 sine imperio, libe-
</p>
<p>rum atque solutum. Hi postquam in una moenia conve-
</p>
<p>nere, 5 dispari genere, dissimili lingua, alius alio more
</p>
<p>viventes ; incredibile memoratu est quam facile coalue-
</p>
<p>rint. Sed, postquam 6 res eorum civibus, moribus, agris
</p>
<p>aucta, satis prospera, satisque pollens videbatur ; sicuti
</p>
<p>pleraque mortalium habentur, invidia ex opulentia orta est.
</p>
<p>Igitur reges populique finitimi bello 7 tentare : pauci ex
</p>
<p>amicis auxilio esse ; nam ceteri, metu 8 perculsi, a pe-
</p>
<p>riculis aberant. At Romani, domi militiaeque intenti,
</p>
<p>festinare, parare, alius alium hortari ; hostibus obviam ire ;
</p>
<p>libertatem, patriam parentesque armis tegere : post, ubi
</p>
<p>pericula virtute propulerant, sociis atque amicis auxilia
</p>
<p>portabant ; magisque dandis quam accipiundis beneficiis,
</p>
<p>amicitias parabant. 9 Imperium legitimum, nomen imperii
</p>
<p>regium habebant : delecti, quibus corpus annis infirmum,
</p>
<p>ingenium sapientia validum, reipublicae consultabant : hi,
</p>
<p>10 vel aetate, vel curae similitudine, Patres appellabantur.
</p>
<p>Post, ubi regium imperium, quod, initio, 11 conservandae
</p>
<p>libertatis, atque augendae reipublicae fuerat, in superbiam
</p>
<p>12 dominationemque 13 convertit ; immutato more, annua
</p>
<p>imperia, binosque imperatores sibi fecere : eo modo
</p>
<p>minume posse putabant per licentiam 14 insolescere animum
</p>
<p>humanum.
</p>
<p>VII. 15 Sed ea tempestate 16 coepere se quisque extol-
</p>
<p>lere, magisque ingenium in promtu habere. Nam regi-
</p>
<p>bus boni, quam mali, suspectiores sunt, semperque his
</p>
<p>aliena virtus formidolosa est. Sed civitas, incredibile
</p>
<p>memoratu est, 17 adepta libertate, quantum brevi creverit :

</p>
<p>tanta cupido gloriae incesserat. Jam primum juventus,
</p>
<p>18 simul laboris ac belli patiens erat, in castris 19 per usum
</p>
<p>militiam discebat : magisque in decoris armis et militari-

<p>SALLUSTII CATILINA. 83
</p>
<p>bus equis, quam in scortis atque conviviis, lubidinem
</p>
<p>habebant. Igitur talibus viris non 1 labos insolitus, non
</p>
<p>locus ullus asper, aut arduus erat, non armatus hostis
</p>
<p>formidolosus : virtus omnia domuerat. Sed gloriae maxu-
</p>
<p>mum certamen inter ipsos erat : 2 sese quisque hostem
</p>
<p>ferire, murum adscendere, conspici dum tale facinus
</p>
<p>faceret, properabat : 3 eas divitias, earn bonam famam
</p>
<p>magnamque nobilitatem putabant : laudis avidi, pecuniae
</p>
<p>liberales erant : gloriam ingentem, divitias honestas vole-
</p>
<p>bant. Memorare possem, quibus in locis maxumas nos-
</p>
<p>trum copias populus Romanus parva manu fuderit, quas
</p>
<p>urbes, natura munitas, pugnando ceperit, 4 ni ea res lon-
</p>
<p>gius ab incepto traheret.
</p>
<p>VIII. Sed profecto For tun a in omni re dominatur ; ea
</p>
<p>5 res cunctas, ex lubidine magis quam ex vero, celebrat
</p>
<p>obscuratque. Atheniensium res gestae, sicuti ego aestu-
</p>
<p>mo, satis amplae magnificaeque fuere ; verum aliquanto
</p>
<p>minores tamen, quam fama feruntur. Sed, quia provenere
</p>
<p>ibi 6 scriptorum magna ingenia, per terrarum orbem Athe-
</p>
<p>niensium facta pro maxumis celebrantur. Ita eorum qui
</p>
<p>fecere virtus tanta habetur, quantum verbis 7 eam potuere
</p>
<p>extollere praeclara ingenia. At populo Romano nunquam
</p>
<p>ea copia fuit : quia 8 prudentissumus quisque negotiosus
</p>
<p>maxume erat ; ingenium nemo sine corpore exercebat ;
</p>
<p>9 optumus quisque facere, quam dicere ; sua ab aliis bene-
</p>
<p>facta laudari, quam ipse aliorum narrare, malebat.
</p>
<p>IX. 10 Igitur domi militiaeque boni mores colebantur ;
</p>
<p>concordia maxuma, minuma avaritia erat ; jus bonumque
</p>
<p>apud eos, non legibus magis quam natura, valebat. Jur-
</p>
<p>gia, discordias, simultates, cum hostibus exercebant :
</p>
<p>cives cum civibus de virtute certabant : n in suppliciis
</p>
<p>deorum magnifici, domi parci, in amicos rideles erant.
</p>
<p>Duabus bis artibus, audacia in bello, 12 ubi pax evenerat,

<p>dubias atque asperas res facile toleraverant, iis otium,

<p>6 materies omnium malorum fuere. Namque avaritia fidem,
</p>
<p>probitatem, ceterasque artis bonas subvertit ; pro his,
</p>
<p>superbiam, crudelitatem, deos neglegere, omnia venalia
</p>
<p>habere, edocuit : ambitio multos mortalis 7 falsos fieri
</p>
<p>subegit ; aliud clausum in pectore, aliud in lingua prom-
</p>
<p>tum habere ; amicitias inimicitiasque, non 8 ex re, sed
</p>
<p>ex commodo, aestumare ; magisque vultum, quam inge-

</p>
<p>quern in Asia ductaverat, quo sibi fidum faceret, contra
</p>
<p>morem majorum, luxuriose nimisque liberaliter habuerat ;
</p>
<p>loca 1 amoena, voluptaria, facile in otio ferocis militum
</p>
<p>animos molliverant. Ibi primum insuevit exercitus populi
</p>
<p>Romani amare, potare ; signa, tabulas pictas, vasa caelata
</p>
<p>mirari ; ea 2 privatim ac publice rapere ; delubra spoliare ;
</p>
<p>sacra profanaque omnia polluere. Igitur hi milites, post-
</p>
<p>quam victoriam adepti sunt, nihil reliqui victis fecere.
</p>
<p>Quippe secundae res sapientium animos 3 fatigant : ne illi,
</p>
<p>corruptis moribus, victoriae temperarent.
</p>
<p>XII. Postquam divitiae honori coepere, et eas gloria,

<p>imperium, potentia sequebatur ; hebescere virtus, pau-
</p>
<p>pertas probro haberi, 4 innocentia pro malivolentia duci
</p>
<p>coepit. Igitur, ex divitiis, juventutem luxuria atque ava-
</p>
<p>ritia, cum superbia, invasere : 5 rapere, consumere ; sua
</p>
<p>parvi pendere, aliena cupere ; 6 pudorem, pudicitiam, di-
</p>
<p>vina atque humana promiscua, nihil pensi atque moderati
</p>
<p>habere. Operae pretium est, quum domos atque villas
</p>
<p>cognoveris in urbium modum exaedificatas, visere templa
</p>
<p>deorum, quae nostri majores, religiosissumi mortales,
</p>
<p>fecere. 7 Verum illi delubra deorum pietate, domos sua
</p>
<p>gloria decorabant ; neque victis quidquam, 8 praeter inju-
</p>
<p>riae licentiam, eripiebant. At hi contra, ignavissumi
</p>
<p>homines, per summum scelus, omnia ea sociis adimere,
</p>
<p>quae fortissumi viri 9 victores reliquerant : proinde quasi

<p>injuriam facere, id demum esset imperio uti.

<p>XIII. Nam quid ea memorem, quae, nisi iis qui videre,

</p>
<p>XIV. x In tanta tamque corrupta civitate, Catilina, id
</p>
<p>quod factu facillumum erat, omnium 2 flagitiorum atque
</p>
<p>facinorum circum se, tamquam stipatorum, catervas habe-
</p>
<p>bat. Nam, quicumque impudicus, adulter, bona patria
</p>
<p>laceraverat ; quique alienum aes grande conrlaverat, 3 quo
</p>
<p>flagitium aut facinus redimeret ; praeterea, omnes undi-
</p>
<p>que parricidae, sacrilegi, 4 convicti judiciis, aut pro factis
</p>
<p>judicium timentes ; ad hoc, 5 quos manus atque lingua per-
</p>
<p>jurio aut sanguine civili alebat ; postremo, omnes quos
</p>
<p>flagitium, egestas, conscius animus exagitabat ; ii Catili-
</p>
<p>nae 6 proxumi familiaresque erant. Quod si quis etiam a
</p>
<p>culpa vacuus in amicitiam ejus 7 inciderat, quotidiano usu
</p>
<p>atque illecebris facile 8 par similisque ceteris efficiebatur.
</p>
<p>Sed maxume adolescentium familiaritates adpetebat :
</p>
<p>eorum animi molles et 9 aetate fluxi, dolis haud difficulter
</p>
<p>capiebantur. Nam, uti cujusque studium ex aetate flagra-
</p>
<p>bat, aliis scorta praebere ; aliis canes atque equos mer-
</p>
<p>cari ; postremo, neque sumtui, neque 10 modestiae suae
</p>
<p>pare ere, dum illos 11 obnoxios fidosque faceret.
</p>
<p>XV. Jam primum adolescens Catilina multa nefanda
</p>
<p>stupra fecerat ; 12 cum virgine nobili, cum 13 sacerdote Ves-
</p>
<p>tae, alia hujuscemodi contra 14 jus fasque. Postremo.
</p>
<p>captus amore 15 Aureliae Orestillae, cujus, praeter formam,

<p>nihil unquam bonus laudavit ; quod ea 16 nubere illi dubi-
</p>

</p>
<p>tur, 18 necato filio, 19 vacuam domum scelestis nuptiis
</p>
<p>fecisse. Quae quidem res mihi in primis videtur caussa
</p>
<p>fuisse facinoris maturandi. Namque animus impurus,
</p>
<p>20 dis hominibusque infestus, neque vigiliis, neque quieti-
</p>
<p>bus sedari poterat ; 21 ita conscientia mentem excitam

<p>erat, et quod plerique Sullani milites, largius suo usi,
</p>
<p>7 rapinarum et victoriae veteris memores, civile bellum
</p>
<p>exoptabant ; opprimundae reipublicae consilium cepit.
</p>
<p>In Italia nullus exercitus : Cn. Pompeius in extremis
</p>

</p>
<p>spes : 10 senatus nihil sane intentus : tutae tranquillaeque

</p>
<p>potero, dicam. 2 L. Tullo, M. Lepido consulibus, P. Au-
</p>
<p>tronius et P. Sulla, 3 legibus ambitus interrogati, 4 poenas
</p>
<p>dederant. Post paullo Catilina, 5 pecuniarum repetun-
</p>
<p>darum reus, probibitus erat consulatum petere, 6 quod
</p>
<p>intra legitimos dies profited nequiverit. Erat eodem
</p>
<p>tempore 7 Cn. Piso, adolescens nobilis, summae audaciae,
</p>
<p>egens, factiosus, quern ad perturbandum rempublicam ino-
</p>
<p>pia atque mali mores stimulabant. Cum hoc, Catilina et
</p>
<p>8 Autronius, consilio communicato, parabant in 9 Capitolio,
</p>
<p>10 Kalendis Januariis, n L. Cottam et L. Torquatum con-
</p>
<p>sules interficere ; 12 ipsi, 13 fascibus correptis, Pisonem cum
</p>
<p>exercitu ad obtinendas duas 14 Hispanias mittere. 15 Ea re
</p>
<p>cognita, rursus in Nonas Februarias consilium caedis
</p>
<p>transtulerant. Jam turn non consulibus modo, sed pie-
</p>
<p>risque senatoribus perniciem machinabantur. 16 Quod ni
</p>
<p>Catilina maturasset pro curia signum sociis dare, eo die,
</p>
<p>post conditam urbem Romanam, pessumum facinus patra-
</p>
<p>tum foret. Quia nondum frequentes armati convenerant,
</p>
<p>ea res 17 consilium diremit.

<p>XIX. Postea Piso in citeriorem Hispaniam 18 quaestor
</p>
<p>pro praetore missus est, adnitente Crasso, quod eum

<p>XX. Catilixa ubi eos, quos paullo ante memoravi,
</p>
<p>convenisse videt ; tametsi cum singulis multa saepe
</p>
<p>egerat, tamen Hm rem fore credens universos adpellare

<p>et cohortari, in abditam partem 2 aedium secedit ; atque

</p>
<p>forent, nequidquam opportuna res cecidisset ; spes magna,
</p>
<p>dominatio, in manibus frustra fuissent : 4 neque ego per
</p>
<p>ignaviam, aut vana ingenia, incerta pro certis captarem.
</p>
<p>Sed, quia multis et magnis 5 tempestatibus vos cognovi
</p>
<p>fortes fidosque mihi, eo animus ausus maxumum atque
</p>
<p>pulcherrumum facinus incipere : simul, 6 quia vobis eadem,
</p>
<p>quae mihi, bona malaque intellexi ; 7 nam idem velle
</p>
<p>atque nolle, ea demum rlrma amicitia est. Sed, ego
</p>
<p>quae mente agitavi, omnes jam antea 8 diversi audistis.

<p>Ceterum milii in dies magis animus accenditur, cum con-

</p>
<p>XXII. Fuere ea tempestate, qui dicerent, Catilinam,
</p>
<p>oratione habita, cum ad jusjurandum popularis sceleris
</p>
<p>sui adigeret, 1 humani corporis sanguinem, vino permix-
</p>
<p>tum, in pateris circumtulisse ; 2 inde cum post exsecra-
</p>
<p>tionem omnes degustavissent, sicuti in solemnibus sacris
</p>
<p>fieri consuevit, aperuisse consilium suum, 3 atque eo, dicti-
</p>
<p>tare, fecisse, quo inter se fidi magis forent, 4 alius alii
</p>
<p>tanti facinoris conscii. Nonnulli flcta haec, multa prae-
</p>
<p>terea, existumabant, ab iis, qui 5 Ciceronis invidiam, quae
</p>
<p>postea orta est, leniri credebant atrocitate sceleris eorum,
</p>
<p>qui poenas dederant. Nobis ea res 6 pro magnitudine
</p>
<p>parum comperta est.
</p>
<p>XXIII. Sed in ea conventione fuit Q. Curius, natus
</p>
<p>baud obscuro loco, flagitiis atque facinoribus coopertus ;
</p>
<p>quern censores senatu, probri gratia, : amoverant. Huic
</p>
<p>homini non minor 8 vanitas, quam audacia : neque reti-
</p>
<p>cere, quae audierat, neque suamet ipse scelera occultare :
</p>
<p>9 prorsus neque dicere, neque facere, quidquam pensi ha-
</p>
<p>bebat. Erat ei cum Fulvia, muliere nobili, 10 vetus con-
</p>
<p>suetudo : cui cum minus gratus esset, quia inopia minus
</p>
<p>largiri poterat, repente glorians n maria montesque polli-
</p>
<p>ceri coepit ; minari interdum ferro, nisi 12 obnoxia foret ;
</p>
<p>postremo ferocius agitare, quam solitus erat. At Fulvia,
</p>
<p>13 insolentiae Curii caussa cognita, tale periculum reipub-
</p>
<p>licae haud occultum habuit ; sed, u sublato auctore, de
</p>
<p>Catilinae conjuratione quae quoque modo audierat, com-
</p>
<p>pluribus narravit. Ea res imprimis studia hominum ac-
</p>
<p>cendit ad consulatum mandandum 15 M. Tullio Ciceroni.
</p>
<p>Namque antea 16 pleraque nobilitas invidia aestuabat, et
</p>
<p>quasi pollui consulatum 17 credebant, si eum, quamvis
</p>
<p>egTegius, 18 homo novus adeptus foret. Sed, ubi periculum
</p>

</p>
<p>fide 1 sumtam mutuam, Faesulas ad 2 Manlium quemdam
</p>
<p>portare, qui postea 3 princeps fuit belli faciundi. Ea tem-
</p>
<p>pestate plurimos cujusque generis homines 4 adscivisse
</p>
<p>dicitur : mulieres etiam aliquot, 5 quae, ubi aetas tantem-
</p>
<p>modo quaestui, neque luxuriae, modum fecerat, aes
</p>
<p>alienum grande conflaverant : per eas se Catilina crede-
</p>
<p>bat posse 6 servitia urbana sollicitare, urbem incendere,
</p>
<p>viros earum vel adjungere sibi, vel interflcere.
</p>
<p>XXV. Sed in his erat 7 Sempronia, quae multa saepe
</p>
<p>8 virilis audaciae facinora commiserat. Haec mulier
</p>
<p>genere atque forma, praeterea 9 viro, liberis satis fortu-
</p>
<p>nata ; litteris Graecis atque Latinis docta ; 10 psallere, sal-
</p>
<p>tare n elegantius, quam necesse est probae ; multa alia,
</p>
<p>quae 12 instrumenta luxuriae. Sed ei cariora semper
</p>
<p>omnia, quam decus atque pudicitia fuit : pecuniae an
</p>
<p>famae minus parceret, haud facile decerneres. Sed ea
</p>
<p>saepe antehac fldem prodiderat, 13 creditum abjuraverat,
</p>
<p>caedis conscia fuerat, luxuria atque inopia praeceps abie-
</p>
<p>rat. 14 Verum ingenium ejus haud absurdum : posse ver-
</p>
<p>sus facere, jocum movere, sermone uti vel modesto, vel
</p>
<p>molli, vel procaci : prorsus multae 15 facetiae multusque
</p>
<p>lepos inerat.
</p>
<p>XXVI. His rebus comparatis, Catilina nihilo minus in
</p>
<p>proxumum annum consulatum petebat ; sperans, si ^de-
</p>
<p>signates foret, facile se ex voluntate Antonio usurum.
</p>
<p>Neque inter ea quietus erat, sed omnibus modis insidias
</p>
<p>parabat Ciceroni. Neque illi tamen ad cavendum 17 dolus,
</p>
<p>aut astutiae deer ant. Namque, a principio consulates sui,
</p>
<p>multa 18 pollicendo per Fulviam, efTecerat, ut Q. Curius,
</p>
<p>de quo paullo ante memoravi, consilia Catilinae sibi
</p>
<p>proderet. Ad hoc, collegam suum Antonium 19 pac-
</p>
<p>tione provinciae perpulerat, 20 ne contra rempublicam
</p>
<p>sentiret ; circum se praesidia amicorum atque 21 clientium

</p>
<p>XXVII. Igitur C. Manlium Faesulas atque in earn
</p>
<p>partem Etruriae, Septimium quemdam, Camertem, in
</p>
<p>agrum Picenum, 2 C. Julium in Apuliam dimisit ; prae-
</p>
<p>terea alium alio, 3 qnem ubique opportunum credebat. In-
</p>
<p>ter ea Romae multa simul moliri : consuli insidias tendere,
</p>
<p>parare incendia, opportuna loca armatis hominibus 4 obsi-
</p>
<p>dere : ipse 5 cum telo esse, 6 item alios jubere : hortari,
</p>
<p>uti semper intenti paratique essent : dies noctesque 7 fes-
</p>
<p>tinare, vigilare, neque insomniis neque labore fatigari.
</p>
<p>Postremo, ubi multa agitanti nihil procedit, rursus 8 intem-
</p>
<p>pesta nocte conjurationis principes convocat per 9 M.
</p>
<p>Porcium Laecam : ibique, multa de ignavia eorum ques-
</p>
<p>tus, docet, " se Manlium praemisisse ad earn multitudinem,
</p>
<p>quam ad capiunda arma paraverat ; item alios in alia
</p>
<p>loca opportuna, qui initium belli facerent ; seque ad exer-
</p>
<p>citum proficisci cupere, si prius Ciceronem oppressisset :
</p>
<p>eum suis consiliis multum obficere."
</p>
<p>XXV HI. Igitur, perterritis ac dubitantibus ceteris,
</p>
<p>10 C. Cornelius, eques Romanus, operam suam pollicitus,
</p>
<p>et cum eo L. Vargunteius, senator, constituere n ea nocte

<p>paratum confodere. Curius, ubi 13 intellegit quantum
</p>
<p>periculi consuli impendeat, propere per Fulviam, dolum
</p>
<p>qui parabatur enunciat. Ita illi, janua prohibiti, tantum
</p>
<p>facinus frustra susceperant. Interea Manlius in Etruria
</p>
<p>plebem sollicitare, egestate simul, ac dolore injuriae,
</p>
<p>novarum rerum cupidam, quod, Sullae dominatione, agros
</p>
<p>bonaque omnia amiserat ; praeterea 14 latrones cujusque
</p>
<p>generis, quorum in ea regione magna copia erat ; nonnul-
</p>
<p>los ex 15 Sullanis colonis, quibus lubido atque luxuria ex
</p>
<p>magnis rapinis nihil reliqui fecerant.

<p>XXIX. Ea cum Ciceroni nunciarentur, 16 ancipiti malo
</p>
<p>permotus, quod neque urbem ab insidiis 17 privato consilio

<p>longius tueri poterat, neque exercitus Manlii quantus, aut

</p>
<p>quo consilio foret, satis compertum habebat, a rem ad
</p>
<p>senatum refert, jam antea 2 volgi rumoribus exagitatam.
</p>
<p>Itaque, quod plerumque 3 in atroci negotio solet, senatus
</p>
<p>decrevit, darent operam consules, ne quid respubli-
</p>
<p>ca detrimenti caperet. 4 Ea potestas per senatum,
</p>
<p>more Romano, magistratui maxuma permittitur ; exercitum
</p>
<p>parare, bellum gerere, coercere omnibus modis socios
</p>
<p>atque civis ; domi militiaeque 5 imperium atque judicium
</p>
<p>sumraum habere : aliter, sine populi jussu, 6 nulli earum
</p>
<p>rerum consuli jus est.
</p>
<p>XXX. Post paucos dies, L. Saenius, senator, in senatu
</p>
<p>litteras 7 recitavit, quas Faesulis adlatas sibi dicebat ; in
</p>
<p>quibus scriptum erat, C. Manlium arma cepisse, cum
</p>
<p>magna multitudine, 8 ante diem sextum Kalendas Novem-
</p>
<p>bris. Simul, id quod in tali re solet, alii portenta atque
</p>
<p>prodigia nunciabant ; alii conventus 9 fieri, arma portari,
</p>
<p>Capuae atque in Apulia servile bellum moveri. Igitur,
</p>
<p>senati decreto, 10 Q. Marcius Rex Faesulas, Q. Metellus
</p>
<p>Creticus in Apuliam n circumque loca, missi : ii utrique
</p>
<p>12 ad urbem imperatores erant ; impediti, ne triumpharent,

<p>13 calumnia paucorum, quibus omnia honesta atque inho-
</p>
<p>nesta vendere mos erat. u Sed praetores, Q. Pompeius

<p>iisque 15 permissum, " uti 16 pro tempore atque periculo

<p>21 diuturna quies pepererat, repente omnis tristitia invasit :

<p>quisque metu pericula metiri. Ad hoc, mulieres, quibus,
</p>
<p>reipublicae magnitudine, belli timor insolitus, 1 adflictare
</p>
<p>sese ; manus supplices ad coelum tendere ; miserari
</p>
<p>parvos liberos ; 2 rogitare ; omnia pavere ; superbia atque
</p>
<p>deliciis omissis, sibi patriaeque diffidere. At Catilinae
</p>
<p>crudelis animus eadem ilia movebat, 3 tamen etsi praesidia
</p>
<p>parabantur, et ipse 4 lege Plautia interrogatus ab L.
</p>
<p>Paullo. 5 Postremo, dissimulandi caussa, atque sui ex-
</p>
<p>purgandi, sicuti 6 jurgio lacessitus foret, 7 in senatum venit.
</p>
<p>Turn M. Tullius consul, sive 8 praesentiam ejus timens,
</p>
<p>seu ira commotus, 9 orationem habuit luculentam atque
</p>
<p>utilem reipublicae ; 10 quam postea scriptam edidit. Sed,
</p>
<p>ubi ille 11 adsedit, Catilina, ut erat paratus ad dissimu-
</p>
<p>landa omnia, demisso voltu, voce supplici postulare,
</p>
<p>" Patres conscripti ne quid de se temere crederent : ea
</p>
<p>familia ortum, ita ab adolescentia vitam instituisse, 12 ut
</p>
<p>omnia bona in spe haberet : ne aestumarent, sibi patricio
</p>
<p>homini, 13 cujus ipsius atque majorum plurima beneiicia
</p>
<p>in plebem Romanam essent, perdita republica opus esse,
</p>
<p>cum earn servaret M. Tullius, u inquilinus civis urbis
</p>
<p>Romae." Ad hoc maledicta alia cum adderet, obstrepere
</p>
<p>omnes, hostem atque 15 parricidam vocare. Turn ille furi-
</p>
<p>bundus : " Quoniam quidem circumventus," inquit, " ab
</p>
<p>inimicis praeceps agor, 16 incendium meum ruina restin-
</p>
<p>guam."
</p>
<p>XXXII. Dein se ex curia domum proripuit ; ibi multa
</p>
<p>secum ipse volvens ; quod neque 17 insidiae consuli pro*
</p>
<p>cedebant, et ab incendio intellegebat urbem vigiliis mu-

<p>l ex suo numero ad Marcium Regem mittit, 2 cum man-

<p>proficiscantur ; ea mansuetudine atque misericordia sena-

<p>conscii conjurationis ; sed omnino cuncta plebes, novarum

<p>nullae sunt, bonis invident, malos extollunt ; Vetera odere,

<p>multi memores Sullanae victoriae, quod ex gregariis

<p>militibus alios senatores videbant, alios ita divites, uti
</p>
<p>9 regio victu atque cultu aetatem agerent, sibi quisque,
</p>
<p>si in armis forent, ex victoria talia sperabant. Praeterea,
</p>
<p>juventus, quae in agris, manuum mercede, inopiam tole-
</p>
<p>raverat, 10 privatis atque publicis largitionibus excita, ur-
</p>

</p>
<p>vincias, aliaque omnia tenere ; ipsi 7 innoxii, rlorentes,
</p>
<p>sine metu aetatem agere ; 8 ceteros judiciis terrere, quo
</p>
<p>plebem in magistratu 9 placidius tractarent. Sed 10 ubi
</p>
<p>primum dubiis rebus novandis spes oblata, 11 vetus certa-
</p>
<p>men animos eorum arrexit. Quod si primo praelio Cati-
</p>

</p>
<p>magna clades atque calamitas rempublicam oppressisset,
</p>
<p>neque illis, qui victoriam adepti, diutius ea uti licuisset,
</p>
<p>quin defessis et 13 exsanguibus, qui plus posset, imperium
</p>
<p>atque libertatem extorqueret. Fuere tamen u extra con-
</p>
<p>jurationem complures, qui ad Catilinam initio profecti
</p>
<p>sunt : in his 15 A. Fulvius, senatoris rllius ; quem, re-
</p>
<p>tractum ex itinere, 16 parens necari jussit. Isdem tem-
</p>
<p>poribus Romae Lentulus, sicuti Catilina praeceperat,
</p>
<p>quoscumque moribus aut fortuna novis rebus idoneos cre-
</p>
<p>debat, aut per se, aut per alios sollicitabat ; neque solum
</p>
<p>cives, sed cujusquemodi genus hominum, quod modo bello

<p>XL. Igitur P. Umbreno cuidam negotium dat, uti

<p>legatos Allobrogum requirat, eosque, si possit, impellat
</p>
<p>ad societatem belli ; existumans, publice privatimque aere

<p>alieno oppressos, praeterea, quod natura gens Gallica
</p>
<p>bellicosa esset, facile eos ad tale consilium adduci posse.

<p>Umbrenus, quod in Gallia 17 negotiatus, plerisque 18 princi-
</p>
<p>pibus notus erat, atque eos no v erat : itaque sine mora, ubi
</p>
<p>primum legatos in foro conspexit, 19 percunctatus pauca

<p>100 SALLUSTII CATILINA.
</p>
<p>de statu civitatis, et quasi dolens ejus casum, requirere
</p>
<p>coepit, " quern exitum tantis malis sperarent V Postquam
</p>
<p>illos Videt " queri de avaritia magistratuum, accusare se-
</p>
<p>natum quod in eo auxilii nihil esset ; miseriis suis reme-
</p>
<p>dium mortem exspectare :" " at ego," inquit, " vobis, 2 si
</p>
<p>modo viri esse voltis, rationem ostendam, qua tanta ista
</p>
<p>mala effugiatis." Haec ubi dixit, Allobroges in maxu-
</p>
<p>mam spem adducti Umbrenum orare, uti sui misereretur :
</p>
<p>nihil tarn asperum, neque tarn difficile, 3 quin cupidissume
</p>
<p>facturi essent, dum ea res civitatem aere alieno liberaret.
</p>
<p>Ille eos in domum D. Bruti perducit ; quod foro propin-
</p>
<p>qua, neque aliena consilii, propter Semproniam ; nam turn
</p>
<p>Brutus 4 ab Roma aberat. Praeterea Gabinium arcessit,
</p>
<p>5 quo major auctoritas sermoni inesset : eo praesente con-
</p>
<p>jurationem aperit ; nominat socios, praeterea multos
</p>
<p>cujusque generis 6 innoxios, quo legatis animus amplior
</p>
<p>esset ; dein eos pollicitos operam suam dimittit.
</p>
<p>XLI. Sed Allobroges diu in incerto habuere, quidnam
</p>
<p>consilii caperent. In altera parte erat aes alienum, stu-
</p>
<p>dium belli, magna merces in spe victoriae : at in altera
</p>
<p>7 majores opes, tuta consilia, pro incerta spe, certa prae-
</p>
<p>mia. Haec illis volventibus, tandem vicit fortuna rei-
</p>
<p>publicae. Itaque Q. Fabio Sangae, cujus 8 patrocinio
</p>
<p>civitas plurimum utebatur, rem omnem, uti cognoverant,
</p>
<p>aperiunt. Cicero, per Sangam 9 consilio cognito, legatis
</p>
<p>praecipit, studium conjurationis vehementer simulent, cet-
</p>
<p>eros adeant, 10 bene polliceantur ; dentque operam, uti eos
</p>
<p>quam maxume manifestos habeant.
</p>
<p>XLII. Isdem fere temporibus in 11 Gallia citeriore
</p>
<p>atque ulteriore, item in agro Piceno, Bruttio, Apuha,
</p>
<p>motus erat. Namque illi, quos antea Catilina dimiserat,

<p>ulteriore Gallia l C. Murena, qui ei provinciae 2 lega-
</p>

</p>
<p>XLIII. At Romae Lentulus, cum ceteris, qui prin-
</p>
<p>cipes conjurationis erant, paratis, ut 3 videbantur, magnis
</p>
<p>copiis, 4 constituerant, uti, Catilina in agrum Faesulanum
</p>
<p>cum venisset, L. Bestia tribunus plebis, concione habita,
</p>
<p>quereretur de 5 actionibus Ciceronis, bellique gravissumi

<p>6 invidiam optumo consuli imponeret ; eo signo, 7 proxuma
</p>
<p>nocte, cetera multitudo conjurationis suum quisque nego-
</p>
<p>tium exsequerentur. Sed ea divisa hoc modo diceban-
</p>
<p>tur : Statilius et Gabinius uti cum magna manu R duodecim
</p>
<p>simul opportuna loca urbis incenderent, quo tiunultu
</p>
<p>facilior aditus ad consulem, ceterosque, quibus insidiae
</p>
<p>parabantur, neret : Cethegus Ciceronis januam 9 obsideret,
</p>
<p>eum vi adgrederetur, 10 alius autem alium : sed 11 filii
</p>
<p>familiarum, quorum ex nobilitate maxuma pars, parentes
</p>
<p>interficerent ; simul, caede et incendio perculsis omnibus,
</p>
<p>ad Catilinam erumperent. Inter haec 12 parata atque de-
</p>
<p>creta, Cethegus semper querebatur de ignavia sociorum :
</p>
<p>illos dubitando et 13 dies prolatando magnas opportunitates
</p>
<p>corrumpere ; facto, non consulto, in tali periculo opus
</p>
<p>esse ; seque, si pauci adjuvarent, languentibus aliis, in>
</p>
<p>petum in curiam facturum. Natura ferox, vehemens,
</p>
<p>manu promtus, maxumum bonum in celeritate putabat.
</p>
<p>XLIV. Sed Allobroges, ex praecepto Ciceronis, per
</p>
<p>Gabinium ceteros u convenhmt ; ab Lentulo, Cethego,
</p>
<p>Statilio, item Cassio, postulant 15 jusjurandum, quod 16 signa-
</p>
<p>tum ad civis perferant : aliter haud facile eos ad tantum
</p>
<p>negotium impelli posse. 17 Ceteri nihil suspicantes dant :
</p>
<p>Cassius semet eo brevi venturum pollicetur, ac paullo
</p>
<p>ante legatos ex urbe proficiscitur. Lentulus cum his T.

<p>Volturciuni quemdam, 18 Crotoniensem, mittit, uti Allo-

</p>
<p>verbis dat : " cum ab senatu hostis judicatus sit, quo con-
</p>
<p>silio servitia repudiet 1 in urbe parata esse, quae jusserit :
</p>
<p>ne cunctetur ipse propius accedere."
</p>
<p>XLV. His rebus ita actis, constituta nocte, qua profi-
</p>
<p>ciscerentur, Cicero, per legatos cuncta edoctus, L. Va-
</p>
<p>lerio Flacco et C. Pomtino, praetoribus, imperat, uti in
</p>
<p>ponte 4 Mulvio, per insidias, Allobrogum 5 comitatus depre-
</p>
<p>hendant : rem omnem aperit, cujus gratia mittebantur :
</p>
<p>6 cetera, uti facto opus sit, ita agant, permittit. 7 Homines
</p>
<p>militares, sine tumultu spraesidiis collocatis, sicuti prae-
</p>
<p>ceptum erat, occulte pontem obsidunt. Postquam ad id
</p>
<p>loci legati cum Yolturcio venere, et simul utrimque
</p>
<p>clamor exortus est ; Galli, 9 cito cognito consilio, sine
</p>
<p>mora praetoribus se tradunt. Volturcius primo, cohorta-
</p>
<p>tus ceteros, gladio se a multitudine defendit ; dein, ubi a
</p>
<p>legatis desertus est, 10 multa prius de salute sua Pomtinum
</p>
<p>obtestatus, quod ei notus erat, postremo timidus, ac vitae
</p>
<p>diffidens, veluti hostibus, sese praetoribus dedit.
</p>
<p>XL VI. n QuiBus rebus confectis, omnia propere per
</p>
<p>nuncios consuli declarantur. At ilium ingens cura atque

<p>patefacta, civitatem periculis ereptam esse : porro autem

<p>anxius erat, in maxumo scelere tantis civibus deprehensis,

<p>quid facto opus ; poenam illorum 12 sibi oneri, impunitatem

<p>13 perdundae reipublicae credebat. Igitur, confirmato ani-

<p>Gabinium, item Q. Coeparium quemdam, Terracinensem,
</p>
<p>qui in Apuliam ad concitanda servitia proficisci parabat.
</p>
<p>Ceteri sine mora veniunt : Coeparius, paullo ante domo

<p>egressus, cognito indicio, ex urbe profugerat. Consul Lentu-

<p>XLYII. Volturcius interrogatus M de itinere, de lit-
</p>
<p>teris, postremo *quid, ant qua de caussa, consilii habuis-
</p>
<p>set ?" primo fingere 2 alia, dissimulare de conjuratione ;
</p>
<p>post, ubi fide publica dicere jussus est, omnia, uti gesta
</p>
<p>erant, aperit : " paucis ante diebus a Gabinio et Coepario
</p>
<p>socium adscitum, nihil amplius scire, quam legatos : tan-
</p>
<p>tummodo ? audire solitum ex Gabinio, P. Autronium, Ser-
</p>
<p>vium Sullam, L. Yargunteium, multos praeterea in ea
</p>
<p>conjuratione esse." Eadem Galli fatentur ; ac Lentulum
</p>
<p>dissimulantem coarguunt, praeter Htteras, sermonibus,
</p>
<p>quos habere solitus : " ex 4 libris Sibyllinis, regnum Ro-

<p>ab 8 incenso Capitolio ilium esse vigesimum annum, quern

</p>
<p>omnes signa sua cognovissent, senatus decernit, " uti
</p>
<p>10 abdicatus magistratu Lentulus, item ceteri in n liberis

<p>XLVIII. Interea plebes, conjuratione patefacta, quae

<p>mente, Catilinae consilia exsecrari, 15 Ciceronem ad coe-

</p>
<p>itinere hostium, senatum edocet : praeterea, " se missum
</p>
<p>a M. Crasso, ] qui Catilinae nunciaret, 2 ne Lentulus,
</p>
<p>Cethegus, alii ex conjuratione deprehensi terrerent ;
</p>
<p>eoque magis properaret ad urbem accedere, quo et cete-
</p>
<p>rorum 3 animos reficeret, et illi facilius e periculo eripe-
</p>
<p>rentur." Sed ubi Tarquinius Crassum nominavit, homi-
</p>
<p>nem nobilem, maxumis divitiis, summa potentia ; 4 alii, rem
</p>
<p>incredibilem rati ; pars, tameri etsi verum existumabant,
</p>
<p>tamen, 5 quia in tali tempore tanta vis hominis leniunda,
</p>
<p>quam exagitanda videbatur, plerique Crasso ex negotiis
</p>
<p>privatis 6 obnoxii, conclamant, " indicem falsum," deque
</p>
<p>ea re postulant 7 uti referatur. Itaque, consulente Cice-
</p>
<p>rone, frequens senatus decernit : " Tarquinii indicium fal-
</p>
<p>sum videri ; eumque in 8 v T inculis retinendum, neque am-
</p>
<p>plius 9 potestatem faciundam, nisi de eo indicaret, cujus
</p>
<p>consilio tantam rem 10 mentitus esset." Erant eo tempore,
</p>
<p>qui aestumarent, illud a P. Autronio machinatum, n quo
</p>
<p>facilius, adpellato Crasso, per societatem periculi reliquos
</p>
<p>illius potentia tegeret. Alii Tarquinium a Cicerone 12 im-
</p>
<p>missum aiebant, ne Crassus, 13 more suo, suscepto malo-
</p>
<p>rum patrocinio, rempublicam conturbaret. Ipsum Crassum
</p>
<p>ego postea u praedicantem audivi, tantam illam contume-
</p>

<p>impellere potuere, uti per Allobroges, aut alium indicem,

<p>clarius esset, egredienti ex senatu 3 Caesari gladio 4 mini-

<p>L. Dum haec in senatu aguntur, et dum legatis Al-

</p>
<p>praemia decernuntur ; 5 liberti, et pauci ex clientibus Len-
</p>
<p>tuli, diversis itineribus, opifices atque servitia in 6 vicis
</p>
<p>ad eum 7 eripiendum sollicitabant ; partim exquirebant
</p>
<p>8 duces multitudinam, qui pretio rempublicam vexare soliti :
</p>
<p>Cethegus autem, per nuncios, 9 familiam atque libertos
</p>
<p>suos, exercitatos in audaciam, orabat, grege facto, cum

<p>QUI IN CUSTODIAM TRADITI ERANT. 11 Sed eOS, paullo

<p>ante, frequens senatus judicaverat, contra rempublicam

<p>quam, bello confecto, de Rhodiis consultum est, majores
</p>
<p>nostri, ne quis divitiarum magis, quam injuriae caussa,

<p>bellum inceptum diceret, 4 impunitos dimisere. Item bellis
</p>
<p>Punicis omnibus, cum saepe Carthaginienses et in pace,
</p>
<p>et 5 per inducias, multa nefaria facinora fecissent, numquam
</p>
<p>ipsi 6 per occasionem talia fecere : magis, quid se dignum
</p>
<p>foret, quam quid 7 in illis jure fieri posset, quaerebant.
</p>
<p>Hoc idem providendum est, Patres conscripti, 8 ne plus

<p>Nam si digna poena pro factis eorum reperitur, 9 novum

</p>
<p>que senatus magna pars, sententiam ejus laudant, 2 virtu-
</p>
<p>tem animi ad coelum ferunt ; alii alios increpantes timidos
</p>
<p>vocant ; Cato magnus atque clarus habetur ; senati decre-
</p>
<p>tum fit, 3 sicuti ille censuerat. 4 Sed mihi multa legenti,
</p>
<p>multa audienti, quae populus Romanus, domi militiaeque,

<p>attendere, 5 quae res maxume tanta negotia sustinuisset.
</p>
<p>Sciebam, saepenumero parva manu cum magnis legioni-

<p>bus hostium contendisse : cognoveram, parvis copiis bella
</p>
<p>gesta cum opulentis regibus ; ad hoc, saepe fortunae vio-
</p>
<p>lentiam toleravisse ; facundia Graecos, gloria belli Gallos
</p>
<p>ante Romanos fuisse. Ac mihi multa 6 agitanti constabat,
</p>
<p>paucorum civium egregiam virtutem cuncta patravisse ;
</p>
<p>eoque factum, uti divitias paupertas, multitudinem pauci-
</p>
<p>tas superaret. Sed postquam luxu atque desidia ci vitas
</p>
<p>corrupta est, rursus respublica magnitudine sua impera-
</p>
<p>torum atque magistratuum vitia sustentabat ; ac, 7 veluti
</p>
<p>effoeta parente, multis tempestatibus haud sane quisquam

<p>fugium ; in altero malis pemicies : Hllius facilitas ; hujus

<p>constantia laudabatur. Postremo, Caesar 2 in animum in-
</p>
<p>duxerat laborare, vigilare ; negotiis amicorum intentus, sua
</p>
<p>neglegere ; nihil denegare, quod dono dignum esset ; sibi
</p>
<p>magnum imperium, exercitum, novum bellum exoptabat,
</p>
<p>ubi virtus enitescere posset. 3 x\t Catoni studium modes-
</p>
<p>tiae, decoris, sed maxume severitatis erat. Non divitiis
</p>
<p>cum divite, neque 4 factione cum factioso ; sed cum stre-
</p>
<p>nuo virtute, cum modesto pudore, cum innocente 5 absti-
</p>
<p>nentia certabat : 6 esse, quam videri, bonus malebat : ita,
</p>
<p>quo minus gloriam petebat, eo magis sequebatur.

<p>instabat, antecapere, ne quid eo spatio novaretur, 7 trium-
</p>
<p>viros, quae supplicium postulabat, parare jubet : ipse,
</p>
<p>dispositis praesidiis, Lentulum in carcerem deducit : idem
</p>
<p>fit ceteris per praetores. Est 8 locus in carcere, quod
</p>
<p>9 Tullianum adpellatur, ubi paullulum 10 escenderis ad lae-
</p>
<p>vam, circiter duodecim pedes humi depressus. Eum
</p>
<p>muniunt undique parietes, atque insuper n camera, lapideis
</p>
<p>fornicibus vincta : sed 12 incultu, tenebris, odore, foeda

<p>atque terribilis ejus facies est. In eum locum postquam

<p>cum exercitu adventabat, Catilina per montes iter facere,
</p>
<p>ad urbem modo, modo 2 in Galliam versus, castra movere ;
</p>
<p>hostibus occasionem pugnandi non dare ; sperabat prope
</p>

<p>quos ad bellum spes rapinarum, aut novarum rerum

<p>asperos, magnis itineribus, 6 in agrum Pistoriensem abdu-

</p>
<p>in agro Piceno praesidebat, 8 ex difficultate rerum eadem

<p>Antonius procul aberat ; 10 utpote qui magno exercitu,

<p>Quocumque ire placet, ferro iter aperiundum est. Qua-

</p>
<p>LIX. Haec ubi dixit, paullulum commoratus, signa
</p>
<p>canere jubet, atque Hnstructos ordines in locum aequum
</p>
<p>deducit : dein, remotis omnium equis, quo militibus, ex-
</p>
<p>aequato periculo, animus amplior esset, ipse 2 pedes exer-
</p>
<p>citum, 3 pro loco atque copiis, instruit. 4 Nam, uti plani-
</p>
<p>ties erat inter sinistros montis, et, ab dextra, rupes aspera,
</p>
<p>octo cohortis in fronte constituit : 5 reliqua signa in
</p>
<p>subsidio artius collocat. 6 Ab his centuriones omnis lectos,
</p>
<p>et 7 evocatos, praeterea ex gregariis militibus optumum
</p>
<p>quemque armatum in primam aciem subducit. V. Man-
</p>
<p>lium in dextera, 8 Faesulanum quemdam sinistra parte
</p>
<p>curare jubet : ipse cum 9 libertis et colonis 10 propter aqui-
</p>
<p>lam adsistit, quam, bello 11 Cimbrico, C. Marius in exer-
</p>
<p>citu habuisse dicebatur. At ex altera parte C. Antonius,
</p>
<p>12 pedibus aeger, quod praelio adesse nequibat, M. Petreio
</p>
<p>legato exercitum permittit. Ille cohortis veteranas, quas
</p>
<p>13 tumulti caussa conscripserat, in fronte ; post eas, cete-
</p>
<p>rum exercitum in subsidiis locat. 14 Ipse equo circumiens,
</p>
<p>unumquemque nominans adpellat, hortatur, rogat, uti
</p>
<p>meminerint, se contra latrones 15 inermos, pro patria, pro
</p>
<p>liberis, pro aris atque focis suis, 16 cernere. Homo milita-

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>TO THE
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR.
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>1. Falso queritur, &c. "Mankind complain without reason j
</p>
<p>of their nature." Falso, literally, "falsely," "erroneously." 
</p>
<p>Sallust has been justly blamed for the introductions to his histories.
</p>
<p>They have little if any relation to the subject which they are in-
</p>
<p>tended to usher in, and are too discursive and long.
</p>
<p>2. Quod imbecilla, &c. " That, being weak and of short duration
</p>
<p>it is influenced more by chance, than by the exertion of intellect." 
</p>
<p>Imbecilla agrees with natura. The less usual form of this adjective
</p>
<p>is imbecillis.  Virtute is here equivalent to virtute animL
</p>
<p>3. Nam contra. " For, on the contrary."
</p>
<p>4. Invenias. " You will find, I think."  The subjunctive is here
</p>
<p>employed to convey a softened assertion, indicative of modesty on
</p>
<p>the part of the writer, and not of any doubt in his mind on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject which he is discussing. So crediderim is frequently used, in
</p>
<p>the sense of " I am inclined to believe."
</p>
<p>5. Magisque naturae, &c. " And that active exertion is more
</p>
<p>wanting to the nature of men, than ability or duration," i. e. than
</p>
<p>additional power or an enlarged period of existence.  Naturae
</p>
<p>hominum is equivalent to homini, " And that man stands more in
</p>
<p>need of," &c.
</p>
<p>6. Sed dux atque imperator, &c. A refutation of those who
</p>
<p>maintain, that human nature is influenced more by chance than by
</p>
<p>any exertion of the mental powers.  Sed may be rendered " Now."
</p>
<p> Dux atque imperator. " The director and ruler." Imperator
</p>
<p>rises in force of meaning above dux. The former means literally,
</p>
<p>u commander in chief;" whereas dux means the highest of the in-
</p>
<p>ferior officers, having himself an important command. These are
</p>
<p>here applied to one and the same objects, for the purpose of showing
</p>
<p>the all-controlling power of the mind.
</p>
<p>7. Grassatur, " Aspires." Literally, " moves boldly on."

</p>
<p>8. Pollens potensque. " Powerful and vigorous." Pollens refers
</p>
<p>here to innate strength, potens to its exercise,
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>122 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>j 9. Quippe probitatem, &c. " Since it (i. e. fortune) can neither
</p>
<p>give, nor take away, integrity, activity, nor other praiseworthy quali-
</p>
<p>ties." Industrial here means an active exercise of our abilities. 
</p>
<p>The student will notice the use of artis for artes. Sallust is very
</p>
<p>much attached to this form of the accusative, omnis for omnes, po-
</p>
<p>pularis for popular es, &c. It is called an archaism, (a term gene-
</p>
<p>rally applied to the use of antiquated or obsolete forms of expression,)
</p>
<p>though not very correctly, since the termination in is would seem
</p>
<p>to have been most commonly employed in the best ages of Latinity.
</p>
<p>The common grammatical rule is, that nouns, whose genitive plural
</p>
<p>ends in ium, have es, is, or eis, in the accusative plural.
</p>
<p>10. Ad inertiam et voluptatis corporis, &c. " It has been con-
</p>
<p>signed to the destructive bondage of sloth and corporeal gratifica-
</p>
<p>tions." The literal meaning of pes sum appears to be " down," " to
</p>
<p>the bottom," "under foot." Hence pessumdo literally means,
</p>
<p>" to send or throw to the bottom," and then figuratively, " to
</p>
<p>ruin or destroy."  Voluptatis is put for voluptates. See previous
</p>
<p>note.
</p>
<p>11. Perniciosa luhdine, &c. In rendering, begin vnthubi, " when,
</p>
<p>after it has enjoyed for a season this destructive indulgence," &c.
</p>
<p>12. Suam quisque culpam, &c. " The authors of these evils
</p>
<p>transfer each to affairs the blame that is their own." They allege
</p>
<p>in extenuation of their mental inactivity, that the affairs to which they
</p>
<p>had directed their attention proved too difficult of accomplishment.
</p>
<p>13. Quod si hominibus, &c. " But if mankind were inspired
</p>
<p>with as great a regard for things conducive to their welfare, as is
</p>
<p>the zeal with which they seek after," &c.  Aliena, " things foreign
</p>
<p>to their nature."
</p>
<p>14. Neque regerentur, &c. " They would not be more controlled
</p>
<p>by, than they would themselves control, the chances of fortune."
</p>
<p>15. Ubi, pro mortalibus. " In which, as far as is consistent with
</p>
<p>mortal lot." Pro mortalibus, literally, " for mortals." Equivalent

</p>
<p>16. Genus humanum. "Man."
</p>
<p>17. Sequuntur. " Partake of."
</p>
<p>18. Praeclarafacies. " Personal beauty."  Literally " a fine
</p>
<p>face," or " exterior."
</p>
<p>19. Dilabuntur. " Insensibly leave us."  Literally, " steal away,"
</p>
<p>"drop off."
</p>
<p>20. Ingenii egregia facinora. " The splendid exertions of intel-
</p>
<p>lect."  Facinus denotes a bold or daring action, and unless it be
</p>
<p>joined with a favourable epithet, or the action be previously de-
</p>
<p>scribed as commendable, the term is always to be understood in a
</p>
<p>JUOURTHINE WAR. 123
</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>vituperative sense. In the present passage, the epithet egregius \
</p>
<p>marks the character of the action as praiseworthy.
</p>
<p>21. Corporis et fortunae bonorum. " Of the advantages of person
</p>
<p>and fortune."
</p>
<p>1. Agit atque habet cuncta, &c. " Controls and sways all O
</p>
<p>things, and is itself controlled by none." After habetur understand
</p>
<p>ab ullo (scil. negotio.)
</p>
<p>2. Quo magis pravitas, &c. " On which account the depravity
</p>
<p>of those is the more to be wondered at," &c.
</p>
<p>3. Incultu. " Through want of culture."
</p>
<p>4. Artes animi. " Mental employments."
</p>
<p>5. Ex his. "Of 'these employments of mind." Understand
</p>
<p>artibus animi.
</p>
<p>6. Omnis cura, &c. " All change of public affairs," or " every
</p>
<p>office of administration." Of these offices, magistratus are of a
</p>
<p>civil, imperia of a military nature.
</p>
<p>7. Quoniam neque virtuti, &c. " Since, neither, on the one
</p>
<p>hand, is the honour, that is its due, rendered to merit, nor are they,
</p>
<p>on the other, who have obtained authority by unfair means," &c. 
</p>
<p>The allusion in fraudem is to bribery and other unworthy and de-
</p>
<p>grading practices. I
</p>
<p>8. Parentes. " Subjected states." From pareo, " to obey,\
</p>
<p>and having the first syllable long. In. parentes, "parents," it is
</p>
<p>short.  The word occurs again in the first chapter of this history.
</p>
<p>9. Delicta corrigas, " may rectify abuses."  Importunum, " a
</p>
<p>perilous task." Literally, " without a harbour," or place of safety
</p>
<p>from the storm.
</p>
<p>10. Fatigando. "After all one's exertions." Understands,
</p>
<p>which in some editions is expressed.
</p>
<p>11. Quern. For aliquem.  Lubido, an archaism for libido.
</p>
<p>12. Gratifcari. " Of sacrificing." i. e. Tanquam rem gratam
</p>
<p>devovere.  More usual Latinity would require gratificandi ; but Sal-

<p>lust is fond of unusual forms of expression.
</p>
<p>13. Quae ingenio exercentur. " Which form the exercise of the

<p>mind." Literally, " which are exercised upon by the mind."
</p>
<p>14. Memoria rerum gestarum. " The recording of past events."
</p>
<p>i. e. historical composition.  Virtute. "Excellence."  Praetere-
</p>
<p>undum. Understand esse mihi.
</p>
<p>15. Per insolentiam. " From a feeling of vanity." Insolentia,
</p>
<p>strictly, is unusual or altered conduct, as when the head is turned
</p>
<p>with vanity and self-conceit.  Studium laudando. " By praising my
</p>
<p>own profession," i. e. of an historian. Before extollere understand me.
</p>

</p>
<p>19. Quibus temporibus. Sallust obtained the office of quaestor,
</p>
<p>which entitled him to a seat in the senate, at the age of twenty-
</p>
<p>seven, a few years after the conspiracy of Catiline, and while the
</p>
<p>state was thrown into the greatest confusion by the acts of Clodius
</p>
<p>and his followers. He was made tribune of the commons six years
</p>
<p>after, on which occasion, according to some authorities, Cato was
</p>
<p>his competitor, but, according to others, when he was made praetor.
</p>
<p>To his success over Cato the historian alludes in the words quales
</p>
<p>viri, &c. If this competition occurred for the office of praetor, he
</p>
<p>had no great reason to be proud of his success, since he obtained
</p>
<p>that magistracy entirely through the interest of Caesar.
</p>
<p>20. Merito. " On good grounds."  Judicium animi mutamsse.
</p>
<p>"Have altered my determination."  Aliorum negotiis. "The
</p>
<p>active employment of others."
</p>
<p>21. Q. Maximum. Quintus Fabius Maximus, the well-known op-
</p>
<p>ponent of Hannibal.  P. Scipionem. The elder Africanus, who con-
</p>
<p>quered Hannibal in the battle of Zama.  Solitos. Understand esse.
</p>
<p>q 1. Imagines. Among the Romans, those whose ancestors, or
</p>
<p>** who themselves had borne any curule office, that is, had been consul,
</p>
<p>praetor, censor, or curule aedile, were called nobiles, and had the
</p>
<p>right of making images of themselves, which were kept with great
</p>
<p>care by their posterity, and exhibited only at funerals or on solemn
</p>
<p>occasions. These images were nothing more than the busts or
</p>
<p>effigies of the individuals, down to the shoulders, made of wax, and
</p>
<p>painted. They were placed in the atrium, or hall, of the Roman
</p>
<p>house, enclosed in wooden cases.

<p>2. Scilicet non ceram Mam, &c. We must here resolve scilicet
</p>
<p>into its component members (scire licet,) and construe as follows .
</p>
<p>Scire licet non ceram illam, &c. habere. " We may well suppose
</p>
<p>that neither the mere wax of which they were made, nor the form
</p>
<p>it had assumed, possessed such power in themselves."
</p>
<p>3. Eorum. " Of the former." Referring to their ancestors, and
</p>
<p>depending in construction on famam and gloriam. With virtus
</p>
<p>supply sua ipsorum, " their own merit." Sallust here argues in fa-
</p>

</p>
<p>actions, by its recounting the deeds of former days.

</p>
<p>these manners that are now prevalent.  Quin contendat, " who does Q
</p>
<p>not seek to vie." Quin is here equivalent to qui no?i.
</p>
<p>5. Homines novi. " Men of humble origin." Literally, "new
</p>
<p>men." Those who were the first of their family that had raised
</p>
<p>themselves to any curule office, were called among the Romans,
</p>
<p>homines novi, in allusion to their recent admission among the no-
</p>
<p>bility.
</p>
<p>6. Furtim et per latrocinia. " By private intrigue and open
</p>
<p>fraud." The acts of peculation, and official plunder, of which the
</p>
<p>Roman magistrates were so frequently guilty, are here stigmatized,
</p>
<p>and they are spoken of as actually affording the means for farther ad-
</p>
<p>vancement in the state. Sallust himself is open to this charge.  Af-
</p>
<p>ter potius we have rejected from the text, with some of the best edi-
</p>
<p>tions, the words quam bonis artibus, as the idea is sufficiently ex-
</p>
<p>pressed by per virtutem which precedes.
</p>
<p>7. Ac non perinde habeantur. " And are not to be estima-
</p>
<p>ted according to the merit of those who fill them." Ac is more fre-
</p>
<p>quently employed after perinde than ut. But its occurrence at the
</p>
<p>beginning of the clause prevents its being again employed on the
</p>
<p>principle of euphony.
</p>
<p>8. Liberius altiusque. "Too freely and too far." Com-
</p>
<p>pare remarks under note 1, page 1.  Redeo. Put here for eo,
</p>
<p>i. e. venio, the compound for the simple. " I now come to my subject."

</p>
<p>victory inclining sometimes to the side of the Romans, and then
</p>
<p>again to that of Jugurtha.

</p>
<p>pose of being thoroughly understood." Ad cognoscendum, literally,
</p>
<p>" for the knowing of them." The gerund, according to the gram-
</p>
<p>marians, is here taken in a passive sense. The change of meaning,
</p>
<p>however, is rather owing to the idiom of modern languages, as ap-
</p>
<p>pears from the literal force of ad cognosceiidum,

<p>3 14. Bello Punico secundo. Consult Historical Index, for an ac-
</p>
<p>count of the Punic wars, and also for some mention of the Cartha-
</p>
<p>ginians, Hannibal, and Masinissa, under their respective heads. 
</p>
<p>Post magnitudinem nominis Romani. " Since the Roman name
</p>
<p>became illustrious.' 
</p>
<p>15. Cui postea Africano, &c. The term Africano is here put in
</p>
<p>the dative by attraction to the dative of the person. In rendering
</p>
<p>the clause, Africano must be taken as equivalent to Africani or Af-
</p>
<p>ricanus. Thus, Est mihi nomen Joanni, " my name is John ;" for
</p>
<p>Est mihi nomen Joannis, (or Joannes.)
</p>
<p>16. Praeclara rei militaris facinora. " Brilliant military exploits."
</p>
<p>Consult note 4, page 2.  Syphace. Consult Historical Index.
</p>
<p>The proper name Syphax is said to have the penult of the genitive
</p>
<p>common. It is on the contrary always long, for the line in Clau-
</p>
<p>dian (Bell. Gild. 91.) where the short quantity occurs, " Compuli-
</p>
<p>mus dirum Syphacem, fractumque Metello," is now altered in the
</p>
<p>best editions, after a conjecture of Barth's, and we read Hanibalem
</p>
<p>for Syphacem.
</p>
<p>17. Regi. Referring to Masinissa.
</p>
<p>18. Imperii vitaeque ejus, &c. The grant of the Romans ceased
</p>
<p>with the life of Masinissa. His son Micipsa reigned merely over
</p>
<p>that part of Numidia which had originally belonged to his parent.
</p>
<p>Cirta, and the portion of Numidia which Syphax had possessed, were
</p>
<p>formed into a Roman province. Hence imperii in the text refers to
</p>
<p>the empire of Masinissa in its full extent, embracing what he had
</p>
<p>received from the Romans.
</p>
<p>^ 1. Absumtis. " Being carried off."
</p>
<p>2. Eodem cultu, &c. " He reared at home in the same way as
</p>
<p>he did his own children." Cultus here has reference to every thing
</p>
<p>connected with the rearing of youth. It may be rendered more
</p>
<p>literally by the term " education." Thus, " he kept at his court,

</p>
<p>and trained up by the same system of education," &c.
</p>
<p>3. Luxu. The old dative for luxui.  Corrumpendum. " To be
</p>
<p>corrupted by them." Literally, "for a corrupting by means of
</p>
<p>them." Understand Mis in the ablative, and consult note 13,
</p>
<p>page 3.
</p>
<p>4. Equitare, jaculari, &c. " He engaged in feats of horseman-
</p>
<p>ship, he learned to throw the lance," &c. The infinitive is here
</p>
<p>put for the imperfect of the indicative, a practice of which Sallust is
</p>
<p>perhaps fonder than any other writer. Grammarians term it the
</p>
<p>historical infinitive, as being principally used in historical narratives,
</p>
<p>in order to give an air of rapidity and animation to the sentence.
</p>
<p>This construction is usually explained by an ellipsis of cocpit or coe-

</p>
<p>will not accord with the sense.
</p>
<p>5. Et, cum omnis gloria anteiret. " And though he surpassed
</p>
<p>all in reputation." Omnis is put for omnes. Consult note 9, page
</p>
<p>1.  Esse, for erat. Consult note 4. So also we have in this same
</p>
<p>sentence, agere for agebat, ferire for feriebat, facer e for faciebat, and
</p>
<p>loqui for loquebatur.
</p>
<p>6. Hominem adolescentem. " The young man." Sallust, by a
</p>
<p>species of archaism (note 9, p. 1.) here uses adolescens, with homo
</p>
<p>expressed, as a verbal adjective. Adolescens is, strictly speaking,
</p>
<p>a verbal, and means " one growing up."-  Exactasua aetate. " His
</p>
<p>own age being far advanced."
</p>
<p>7. Magis magisque crescere. " Increased more and more in
</p>
<p>reputation." Crescere is here the ordinary infinitive, preceded in
</p>
<p>construction by hominem adolescentem,
</p>
<p>8. Avida imperii, &c. " Eager after power, and hurried head-
</p>
<p>long to the gratification of its ruling propensity." Animi cupidinem
</p>
<p>is an archaism for cwpidinem alone.  Opportunitas suaeque, &c.
</p>
<p>" The favourable opportunity afforded by his own and the age of his
</p>
<p>children, a circumstance which leads even moderate men astray by
</p>
<p>the hope of self-aggrandizement."
</p>
<p>9. Seditio. " Insurrection."  Bellum. " War," i. e. civil war.
</p>
<p> Anxius. " Apprehensive."
</p>
<p>10. Popularibus. " To his countrymen."
</p>
<p>11. Numantino. Consult Geographical Index.  Cum mitteret.
</p>
<p>" Being engaged in sending."  Ostentando virtutem. " In ostenta-
</p>
<p>tiously displaying his valour."  Saevitia. " By the furious bravery."
</p>
<p>12. Impigro atque acri ingenio. "Of a quick and penetrating
</p>
<p>turn of mind."  P. Scipionis. The younger Africanus, called also
</p>
<p>Aemilianus.  Morem hostium. " The mode of fighting practised

<p>Adferre. " To generate."
</p>
<p>2. Res asperas. " Difficult enterprises."  Agere for agebat ; so
</p>
<p>habere for habebat, and amplecti for amplectebatur. This peculiar-
</p>
<p>ity in Sallust's style need no longer be noted by us. The student
</p>
<p>will easily discover it himself. (Consult note 4, page 4.)  Magis

<p>magisque, &c. " He became more and more attached to him every
</p>
<p>day."
</p>
<p>3. Munificentia animi, &c. " A generosity of spirit and shrewd-
</p>
<p>ness of intellect."  Quis for quibus.

</p>
<p>i. e. at Rome.  Apud socios clari magis quam honesti. " Men ra-

</p>
<p>Equivalent to magnam potius quam bonam famam habenies.
</p>
<p>5. Non mediocrem animum. " The ambitious spirit."
</p>
<p>6. Romae omnia venalia esse. Meaning that he could purchase, if
</p>
<p>he pleased, the kingdom of Numidia from the Romans, after the
</p>
<p>death of Micipsa. The power of Jugurtha's bribes will be seen in
</p>
<p>the course of the narrative.
</p>
<p>7. Rcvorti. An archaism for reverti.  Praetorium. "The gene-
</p>
<p>ral's tent.," i. e. his own (Scipio's) tent. The name of praetor was
</p>
<p>anciently common to all the Roman magistrates, and, in its primi-
</p>
<p>tive acceptation, means a commander, or general. (7* qui praeit
</p>
<p>jure et exercitu. Varro.) The term praetorxum is often used to de-
</p>
<p>note not only the tent of the commander, but also the space around
</p>
<p>for his retinue and body-guard ; not, however, in thia passage.
</p>
<p>8. Publice, quam prwatim. u Publicly rather than privately,"
</p>
<p>i. e. by public services, rather than by private interest.  Quibus

<p>2. In meum rrgnum. u Into my kingdom," i. e. as one of my

</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>1Q Referring to Jugurtha. Some editions have alter, referring of course
</p>
<p>to the speaker.
</p>
<p>8. Generis praesidia, &c. " Air the supports of my family are
</p>
<p>cut off."  Naturae concessit. " Has paid the debt of nature."
</p>
<p>Literally, " has yielded to nature," i. e. to the universal law of
</p>
<p>nature.
</p>
<p>9. Quern minume decuit. " Whom such a deed least of all be-
</p>
<p>came," i. e. who should have been the last to do it. The clause
</p>
<p>refers to propinquus, not to fratri.
</p>
<p>10. Adfines, amicos, &c. " One disaster has crushed one,
</p>
<p>another has crushed another, of my relatives, my friends, the rest of
</p>
<p>those who were near to me." Sallust is very fond of the construction
</p>
<p>with alius. It must be repeated in translating.
</p>
<p>11. Pars .... acti. An instance of the figure which gram-
</p>
<p>marians call synesis, where the adjective, participle, &c. refer to
</p>
<p>the person or persons implied by a word, and do not agree in gender
</p>
<p>with the word itself. Acti, in this clause, and objecti, in the next,
</p>
<p>refer to adfines, amici, and propinqui, and agree with them in
</p>
<p>gender.
</p>
<p>12. Exigunt. "Drag out."  Necessariis. "Friendly." Ne-
</p>
<p>cessaria are here opposed to adversa, and denote those acts of kind-
</p>
<p>ness and affection which we are necessarily led to expect from those
</p>
<p>who are connected with us by the ties of consanguinity. And hence
</p>
<p>the term necessitudo is used for relationship or any intimate con-
</p>
<p>nexion. Adherbal expected from Jugurtha the kindness and affec-
</p>
<p>tion of a brother, but only met with acts of hostility.
</p>
<p>13. Nunc verOj &c. This is an instance of what the logicians
</p>
<p>call the argument a fortiori. Even though I had not been stripped
</p>
<p>of my kingdom and all my resources, remarks Adherbal, still, if any
</p>
<p>unexpected injur}'' had been done me, I would have implored your
</p>
<p>aid. How much more ought I to implore it now, when an exile and
</p>
<p>a beggar !

<p>14. Omnium honestarum renim. "Of all things suitable to my
</p>
<p>; rank."
</p>
<p>15. b vestram amicitiam. " On account of your friendship
</p>
<p> towards us," i. e. our alliance with you.  Majorum meorum, &c.
</p>
<p>" Very many a memorial of the hostilities committed by my fore-
</p>
<p>fathers," i. e. committed by them against the neighbouring nations
</p>
<p>in furtherance of the Roman power.
</p>
<p>J \ 1. Postremo, 3Iasinissa, &c. A new argument. I cannot obtain
</p>
<p>any aid from other powers ; and even if I could, the injunctions of
</p>
<p>my father Masinissa would not permit me to do so. He taught us
</p>
<p>to look to you for aid in all our difficulties. It is yours therefore to
</p>
<p>JfGURTHIXE WAR. 135
</p>
<p>Page,
</p>
<p>render the assistance which I claim, and the more so too, as you 1 1
</p>
<p>are fully able to afford it.
</p>
<p>2. Una nobis occidendum esse. " That we must fall along with
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>3. Magni estis, &c. "You are become a great and powerful
</p>
<p>people." Opulentus is here equivalent to apibus potens.  Omnia
</p>
<p>secunda, &c. "All things prosper w T ith you, and are obedient to
</p>
<p>your sway," i. e. all your undertakings are crowned with success,
</p>
<p>and every thing yields to your power.
</p>
<p>4. Quos put for aliquos.  Parum cognita. u 111 understood by
</p>
<p>them." Referring to their ignorance of Jugurtha's real character,
</p>
<p>and hinting that he only wishes to make tools of them in furthering
</p>
<p>his own views, and screening himself from punishment.  Trans-
</p>
<p>vorsos. " Astray," i. e. from the path of duty and honour.
</p>
<p>5. Fatigare. " Are importuning."  Fingere me verba. "That
</p>
<p>I feign what I say," i. e. that my grievances are all pretended. 
</p>
<p>Cui licuerit mature. " "When I might have remained."
</p>
<p>6. Quod utinmm, &c. "But would that I may see." The use
</p>
<p>of quod before many conjunctions, &c, merely as a copulative, ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have arisen from the fondness of the Latin writers for the
</p>
<p>connexion by means of relatives.
</p>
<p>7. Ne. "Yes !" The more usual form is nac, from the Greek
</p>
<p>rat.  Qui nunc sceleribus suis, &c. " WTio is now emboldened by,
</p>
<p>and glories in, his crimes."
</p>
<p>8. Jam jam, f rater, &c. The mention of his brother in the pre-
</p>
<p>vious sentence, reminds him of all that brother's misfortune, and he
</p>
<p>bursts forth therefore into an invocation full of the strongest feeling.
</p>
<p> Regnum. Understand tantum or tantummodo. So in Greek,
</p>
<p>fiouov is often omitted after the particles ov and jut, and must be sup-
</p>
<p>plied in translating.
</p>
<p>9. Rerum humanarum. " Of the instability of human affairs."  An
</p>
<p>regno consulam. " Or consult for the welfare of my kingdom,"

<p>i. e. by making peace with the usurper, save my subjects from the
</p>
<p>horrors of a war.  Cujus vitae necisque, Sec. " Since my own life
</p>
<p>or death depends entirely on the aid which I am soliciting from
</p>
<p>others," i. e. since I have no other quarter from which to expect
</p>
<p>even personal safety but the Roman power ; while, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, I am every moment in dread of death from the violence of Ju-
</p>
<p>gurtha.
</p>
<p>10. Emori. " A speedy death." The mrinitive here supplies the
</p>
<p>place of a noun, or, more correctly speaking, is employed in its true
</p>
<p>character. For this mood, partaking of the nature of a noun, has
</p>
<p>been called by grammarians the " verb's noun," {ovo^a *pTjparo$.)
</p>
<p>136 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>| | The reason of this appellation is more apparent, however, m Greek,
</p>
<p>from its taking the prepositive article before it in all cases ; as rd
</p>
<p>ypatyav, tov ypafeiv, tw ypd^ew. The same construction is not un-
</p>
<p>known in English. Thus Spenser : 
</p>
<p>"For not to have been dipped in Lethe lake,
</p>
<p>Could save the son of Thetis from to die."
</p>
<p>11. Ncu jure contemtus, &c. " And that I might not appear a
</p>
<p>just object of contempt." Cortius reads vivere instead of jure , and
</p>
<p>makes it equivalent to vivcrem, regarding vidcrcr as a mere appen-
</p>
<p>dage to the sentence, in imitation of the Greek idiom, where words
</p>
<p>that, refer literally to what appears to be the case, are sometimes
</p>
<p>taken in the sense of reality, and refer to what is actually the case ;
</p>
<p>such as Qaivwj Sokco), &c. Other editions have vcrc.
</p>
<p>12. Neque vivere lubet. " Life neither possesses any charms '*' 
</p>
<p>Ite obviarn. injuriae. " Set your faces against injustice."  Tabes-
</p>
<p>cere. " To fall by degrees to ruin." A metaphor borrowed from
</p>
<p>the effects of a wasting malady on the human frame. The guilt of
</p>
<p>Jugurtha is to prove, if unchecked by Roman power, a corroding
</p>
<p>canker, that will consume by degrees all the prosperity of Nu-
</p>
<p>midia.
</p>
<p>12 1. Caussa. " The justice of their cause."  Sacatiam. "Cru-
</p>
<p>elty."  Vitro. " Without any provocation."  Quod injuriam, &c.
</p>
<p>" Because he had not been able to commit the wrong that he in-
</p>
<p>tended."  Ahum ac. " Other than."  Utnque. " Both parties,"

<p>i. e. Adherbal and Jugurtha's ambassadors.

</p>
<p>mons." According to Plutarch, not less than three thousand of the
</p>
<p>lower orders were- slain on this occasion. (Vit. Gracch. c. 18.)
</p>
<p>5. Adcuratissume. " With the most studied respect."  Famae>
</p>
<p>fide. Some editions read fama, an old form for famae, the dative.
</p>
<p>We have given the regular form for the dative at once. Fide is by
</p>
<p>an archaism for fidei.
</p>
<p>6. Maureianiam. Consult Geographical Index.  Mam alteram.
</p>
<p>" The other." Mam is here used, by an archaism, with the force
</p>
<p>of the Greek article.  Specie, quam u&u, potior em. " Better in ap-
</p>
<p>pearance than reality."
</p>
<p>7. Res postulare videtur. " My subject here seems to require of
</p>
<p>me."  Attingere. "To touch slightly upon," i. e. to give a brief
</p>
<p>account.  Asperitatem. " The difficulty of travelling." Literally,
</p>
<p>"the wildness or ruggedness of the country."  Minus frequentata
</p>
<p>sunt. "Are less frequented." Cortius tdkes frequentata sunt in the
</p>
<p>sense of Jiabitata sunt. The other meaning, however, appears, upon
</p>
<p>a careful examination of the passage, to agree better with the context.
</p>
<p>1. De is haud facile, &c. " Of these I cannot easily speak with |3
</p>
<p>any degree of certainty." Is by an archaism for iis.  Absolvam.
</p>
<p>"I will despatch."
</p>
<p>2. In partem tertiam, &c. a Have reckoned Africa as a third
</p>
<p>part." Literally, " have set down Africa for a third part." Some
</p>
<p>read in parte tertia. But the best manuscripts are in favour of the
</p>
<p>other lection, and the literal translation we have given shows its
</p>
<p>propriety.  Fauci tantummodo, &c. Understand voluerunt, or
</p>
<p>else posuerunt. Varro is one of those who make but two divisions
</p>
<p>of the ancient world. His words are : " Ut omnis natura in coelum
</p>
<p>et terram divisa est, sic coelum in rcgiones, terra in Asiam et Eu-

<p>the Romans. His account, however, of the early history of the

<p>people of Africa is of no value whatever, nor does he appear to

<p>have believed it himself.
</p>
<p>4. Fretum nostri maris et oceani. " The strait connecting our sea
</p>
<p>with the ocean." The straits of Gibraltar are here meant, called
</p>

<p>assigned by the Roman commissioners to Adherbal : there, however,

<p>it only means " better provided with harbours" than the part given

</p>
<p>Numidae really denote a pastoral people, and be derived from J^
</p>
<p>vdfir], (" pasture,") as Sallust supposes, it must have been given to
</p>
<p>the people who bore it by the Greeks, among whom the term
</p>
<p>No^dcfcs was applied to pastoral nations in general. Le Clere (ad
</p>
<p>Genes. 10, 6.) derives the appellation Numidae from the Phoenician
</p>
<p>Nemoudim, "wanderers/*
</p>
<p>2. Mapalia. This term appears to be analogous to our English
</p>
<p>word "huts." The Numidian mapalia were constructed of reeds
</p>
<p>and other similar materials, according to Silius Italicus (17, 88.)
</p>
<p>From Sallust's description they would seem to have resembled the
</p>
<p>dwellings of many barbarous tribes of the present day. The ancient
</p>
<p>writers make mention also of Numidian magatia. According to
</p>
<p>some, the magatia were fixed abodes, forming villages and towns ;
</p>
<p>whereas the mapalia were moveable dwellings, and were carried
</p>
<p>about on wagons according as this nomadic race changed their
</p>
<p>place of residence. Mapalia has the first syllable short, but magalia
</p>
<p>long. Servius makes the true orthography of the latter magaria t
</p>
<p>and derives the word from the Phoenician magar, equivalent as he
</p>
<p>informs us, to the Latin " villa."

</p>
<p>at the top in a roof."  Carinae. " The hulls."

<p>5. Mauros pro Mcdis adpellantes. This etymology is of no value.
</p>
<p>Bochart, with more probability, deduces the name Mauri from the
</p>
<p>Phoenician Mauharim, meaning " the farthest people," for after the
</p>
<p>Mauri came the Western ocean.

</p>
<p>note the construction, loca, quae .... appcllatur. The relative

<p>here agrees with the following word in the singular, in place of that

<p>verb being put in the plural. It is the usual practice of Cicero

<p>to connect the relative in agreement or gender with a following

<p>to the colony that went forth from it.  Hi, qui ad nostrum, &c.

<p>Referring to the colony alone.  Quia Libyes, &c. The reason

<p>assigned by Sallust for the more rapid growth and the greater repu-

</p>
<p>made themselves conspicuous by the conquest of these. Whereas
</p>
<p>the parent state, though it had become in some degree united with
</p>
<p>the Gaetuli by intermarriage, yet still found in many tribes of that
</p>
<p>nation very powerful opponents, who prevented by their continual
</p>
<p>hostilities any very rapid increase of national strength. It will be
</p>
<p>perceived that Sallust, in the course of this history, makes the
</p>
<p>Gaetuli a distinct people from the Numidians, so that the union to
</p>
<p>which he refers could not have been a very strong or extensive one.

<p>8. Pars inferior. Referring to the part " nearer the sea," i. e.
</p>
<p>the shores of the Mediterranean.  Concessere. " Became merged."

<p>Phoenicia, from which the colonies that founded them had come.

</p>
<p>More literally, " On the side of the Catabathmus." The Catabath-
</p>
<p>mus, it will be remembered, was made, in the 17th chapter, the
</p>
<p>eastern limit of Africa, by which arrangement Egypt became part of
</p>
<p>Asia.  Secundo mari. "And following the seacoast."
</p>
<p>11. Thereon. The Greek genitive plural (QnpaTuiv) Latinized,
</p>
<p>and put for the more common Latin form Theracorum. The The-
</p>
<p>reans were the natives of Thera. Consult Geographical Index.
</p>
<p>12. Leptis. The city of Leptis Magna is here meant. The one
</p>
<p>alluded to in the beginning of the chapter is Leptis Parva.
</p>
<p>13. Philaenon arae. " The altars of the Philaeni." We have
</p>
<p>here the Greek genitive plural ($i\aiv<ov) again Latinized. An ac-

<p>simple verb agere, to give a fuller sound to the clause, a practice

<p>very common in Sallust.

<p>2. Timor em animi. An archaism for timorem alone.  Praemia
</p>
<p>sceleris. " The rewards of his guilt," i. e. impunity, and the half
</p>
<p>of Numidia, instead of the third part.  Cerium ratus. " Deeming

<p>that to be a fact."  Apud Numantiam. " Before Numantia," i. e.

</p>
<p>danger.
</p>
<p>4. Convertit. Supply cur sum suum, or something similar. 
</p>
<p>Dolore permocum. " Stung with indignation." The primitive
</p>
<p>meaning of dolor is the smarting sensation attendant on a wound.
</p>
<p>It becomes therefore a strong term when applied to the moral feel-
</p>
<p>ings.  Eamque rem belli caussam fore. Jugurtha hoped that Adher-
</p>
<p>bal would be crushed by him before the Romans could interfere,
</p>
<p>and that then he could easily buy off the resentment of the latter.
</p>
<p>5. Contumeliosa dicta. " An insulting reply." Contumelia t
</p>
<p>whence the adjective is formed, generally denotes a direct and
</p>
<p>studied insult, and is somewhat analogous, in this respect, to the
</p>
<p>Greek v,3pts.  Quia tentatum antea, &c. " Because, when tried
</p>
<p>on a former occasion, it had eventuated otherwise than he had ex-

<p> Praedas agere. This expression is properly applied to that
</p>
<p>species of booty which can be driven off, such as cattle, flocks, &c.

<p>ayeiv kcli <ppeiv.
</p>
<p>7. Eo proce&sum. " That matters had come to such a pass," 
</p>
<p>Necessario. Equivalent to necessitate coactus, and implying that
</p>
<p>Adherbal only took up arms because absolutely forced so to do. The
</p>
<p>term necessario, therefore, does not appear superfluous in this pas-
</p>
<p>sage, as some contend.  Die extremum. We have here the old
</p>
<p>form of the genitive singular of dies, instead of diei. Compare the
</p>
<p>words of Priscian :  " Veteres frequentissime inveniuntur similem
</p>
<p>ablativo protulisse in hoc declinatione (scil. quinta) tarn genitivum
</p>
<p>quam dativum." (7, 19.)
</p>
<p>1. Obscuro etiam turn lumine. "The light (of the approaching 16

</p>
<p>16 day) being still as yet obscure."  Partim. " Some."  Togatorum.
</p>
<p>" Of Romans." Referring to the Romans (whether natives of Rome
</p>
<p>or provincials enjoying the rights of citizenship) who were dwelling
</p>
<p>at Cirta for commercial or other purposes. The Romans, from their
</p>
<p>use of the toga, were called gens togata, or simply togati. The
</p>
<p>Greeks, from their wearing the pallium, were denominated by the
</p>
<p>Romans, palliati, or gens palliata ; and the Gauls, from their use of
</p>
<p>the braccae, a species of striped under-garments,, gens braccata.
</p>
<p>2. Vineis. The vineae were machines in the form of sheds, and
</p>
<p>constructed of wood and hurdles, covered with earth or raw hides,
</p>
<p>or any materials which could not easily be set on fire. They were
</p>
<p>pushed forward by wheels below. Under them the besiegers either
</p>
<p>worked the ram, or tried to undermine the walls.  Turribusque.
</p>
<p>The tarres, or towers, were of two kinds ; fixed and moveable. The
</p>
<p>fixed towers w r ere raised on the agger, or mound, and consisted of
</p>
<p>different stories, from which showers of darts and stones were dis-
</p>
<p>charged by means of engines called catapultae, balistae, and
</p>
<p>scorpiones. The moveable towers were pushed forward and brought
</p>
<p>back on wheels, fixed below, on the inside of the planks. To
</p>
<p>prevent them from being set on fire by the enemy, the towers,
</p>
<p>both fixed and moveable, but more particularly the latter, were
</p>
<p>covered with raw hides, and pieces of coarse cloth, and mattresses.
</p>
<p>3. Tempus legatorum antccapere. " To anticipate the return of
</p>
<p>the ambassadors."  Tres adolescentes. Cortius thinks that these
</p>
<p>words are a mere gloss, and ought to be removed from the text.
</p>
<p>The opinion does not seem very probable, as a copyist would in all
</p>
<p>likelihood have added any thing else rather than these particular
</p>
<p>words. Compare also chapter 25, where it is stated that majores
</p>
<p>natu, nobiles, amplis honoribus, were sent as ambassadors. Tres
</p>
<p>adolescentes, therefore, is in the manner of Sallust.

<p>after mature deliberation," to the senate.  Seque illisque. Se re-
</p>
<p>fers here to the senate and people, Mis to Jugurtha and Adherbal.

</p>
<p>the act.  Oratione. " The embassy."  Nbn malitia. " Not by
</p>
<p>any evil arts." Jugurtha craftily endeavours to call off the attention
</p>
<p>of the Roman ambassadors from his recent crimes, by referring to
</p>
<p>his former meritorious conduct.  Ob easdem artis. " That, from
</p>
<p>the exercise of the same good qualities."  Non penuria. "Not
</p>
<p>from any want."  Adopt atum. This remark of Jugurtha appa-
</p>
<p>rently contradicts what has alreadv been said in chapter 10, cxistu-

<p>Page.
</p>
<p>mans non minus me tibi quam liber is, si genuisscm, &c. but it will Jg
</p>
<p>be remembered that Jugurtha, although taken into Micipsa's family
</p>
<p>when very young, and before that monarch had any children of his
</p>
<p>own, was not actually adopted until three years before Micipsa's
</p>
<p>death, when the latter had sons who were grown up.
</p>
<p>6. Neque recte, neque pro bono. " Neither justly nor for their
</p>
<p>own interests."  Sese. Referring to Jugurtha. In strict Latinity,
</p>
<p>if a second subject be introduced, se refers to that subject, and is
</p>
<p>should be used for the first. This rule is neglected, however, in
</p>
<p>some instances, where no ambiguity can arise. Thus, in the present
</p>
<p>case, sese can only refer to Jugurtha, and in no way to the Romans.
</p>
<p>7. Utrique digrcdiuntur. " They each separate," i. e. the am-
</p>
<p>bassadors and Jugurtha.  Copia non fiat. The ambassadors had
</p>
<p>no opportunity afforded them."
</p>
<p>1. VaXlo. In besieging a place, the Roman mode, which Ju- 17
</p>
<p>gurtha here imitates, was to draw lines composed of a rampart and
</p>
<p>ditch, and sometimes a solid wall of considerable height and thick-
</p>
<p>ness, flanked with towers, at proper distances, around the whole. 
</p>
<p>Turris. Fixed towers are here meant. Consult note 2, page 16.
</p>
<p>2. Formidinem. " What was calculated to alarm."  Prorsus
</p>
<p>i?itentus. " Wholly bent on the object he had in view."
</p>
<p>3. Hostcm infestum. " That his enemy was implacable against
</p>
<p>him," i. e. was bent on his ruin.  Miscrando casum suum. " By
</p>
<p>exciting their compassion for his own hard lot."  Confirmat. " He
</p>
<p>prevails on them."
</p>
<p>4. Rccitatae. "Was read aloud." Legere, "to read," to
</p>
<p>pause with the eyes without uttering any sound. Recitare, "to
</p>
<p>read aloud," that others may hear.
</p>
<p>5. Neque vos, &c. This is skilfully framed to excite the indig-
</p>
<p>nation of the Romans against Jugurtha.  In animo habeat. " He
</p>
<p>cares for," i. e. allows to occupy his thoughts.  Quam. Malit,
</p>
<p>being equivalent to magis velit, supercedes the necessity of insert-

<p>6. Plura de Jugurtha, &c. " My wretched condition dissuades
</p>
<p>me from writing more respecting Jugurtha.",
</p>
<p>7. Nisi tamen, intelligo, &c. The preceding clause, from etiam
</p>
<p>antea to miseris esse, is to be taken parenthetically ; and then nisi,
</p>
<p>in the sense of praeterquam, will serve to correct the assertion made
</p>
<p>in the words plura de Jugurtha, &c. The literal translation will be,
</p>
<p>" Save this one thing, however, that I perceive he is aiming at
</p>
<p>something higher than myself." A freer version, however, will
</p>
<p>render the connexion more apparent : " Only this, however, I will

<p>elegantly used in the sense of haec : " These, I allow, may have

<p>3. Tribunusplebis. The tribunes of the commons were the famous
</p>
<p>popular magistrates, who, by repeated attacks on the nobility, event-
</p>
<p>ually brought over the government of Rome from an aristocratic to
</p>
<p>a democratical form. They were created originally A. U. C. 260,
</p>
<p>at the time of the secession to the sacred mount, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of protecting the rights of the people. Their power was almost
</p>

<p>5. Praesenti consilio. " In presence of the council of war." 20
</p>
<p>The Roman military council was composed of the lieutenant-gene-
</p>
<p>rals, and the tribunes of the soldiers, together with the oldest cen-
</p>
<p>turion in the legion, the commander-in-chief presiding.  De invidia
</p>
<p>fucti. " Concerning the odium to which his conduct had given
</p>
<p>rise," i. e.. for the purpose of exculpating himself from the odium to
</p>
<p>which, &c.
</p>
<p>6. Quasi per saturam, <kc. " The opinions of the council being
</p>
<p>asked in a hasty and confused manner as it were." More literally,
</p>
<p>though less elegantly, "having been taken as it were by the gross
</p>
<p>or lump." We have nothing in English that can answer as a close
</p>
<p>and exact translation of the phrase per saturam. The term satura
</p>
<p>is properly an adjective with lanx understood, and signifies, literally,
</p>
<p>the dish or platter, annually filled with all sorts of fruits, and offered
</p>
<p>to the gods as the first-fruits of the season. From this medley, the
</p>
<p>term is figuratively used in our text to denote a confused and pro-
</p>
<p>miscuous collecting of the votes. In like manner, a lex satura
</p>
<p>(where satura is again merely an adjective, agreeing with /ex,) was
</p>
<p>one that embraced many topics unconnected with each other ; and
</p>
<p>it was a rule of the Roman code, that no existing law be abrogated
</p>
<p>by a lex satura, on account of the unfairness of such a mode of pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, and the facilities which it afforded for taking by surprise.
</p>
<p>So, again, the Latin tenn satira, takes its name from this source,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the medley of verses of different metres, and
</p>
<p>topics of various natures, which the earlier writers of satire were
</p>
<p>accustomed to employ. Varro even mixed prose with poetry, and
</p>
<p>called these pieces satirae.
</p>
<p>7. Pro cousilio. " Before the council." This signification of
</p>
<p>pro is derived immediately from that of the Greek irpd.  Ad magis-
</p>
<p>tratus rogandos. " To hold the election for magistrates." More
</p>
<p>literally, " to preside at," &c. The usual beginning of all applica-
</p>
<p>tions to the people was Vclitis, jubeatis, Quirites ; and thus the

</p>
<p>people were said to be consulted or asked, {consuli siverogari,) and
</p>
<p>the presiding magistrate to consult or ask them. Hence rogare
</p>
<p>magistrates, " to create magistrates," or, as here, to preside at their
</p>
<p>election; rogare quaesitores, "to appoint commissioners." And
</p>
<p>hence also, rogatio is a " bill," while the matter is still pending,
</p>
<p>but lex, " a law," when it has been favourably received by the
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>1. De facto consulis agitari. " The conduct of the consul was a g J
</p>
<p>theme of conversation."  Gravis invidia. " Deep indignation."
</p>
<p>Patres probarentne" &c. In translating this clause, the emphasis
</p>
<p>must be made to fall on patres, as opposed to plebem in the previous
</p>
<p>148 NOTES TO THE
</p>

</p>
<p>21 part of the sentence, and patres will then have in our idiom the force
</p>
<p>of an accusative, (as if governed by quod ad understood,) though in
</p>
<p>fact the nominative to probarent. " As to the senate, it was uncer-
</p>
<p>tain whether they would approve of so dishonourable a course ol
</p>
<p>conduct," &c.
</p>
<p>2. Clara poll ens que fuit. " Was distinguished and influential,"
</p>
<p>i. e. was of a high character itself, and exercised a strong influence
</p>
<p>over the minds of the people.  Perscriberc. " To give entire."
</p>
<p>The speech, however, although this phraseology is here employed,
</p>
<p>is the mere production of the historian. -Ac potissumum. Under-
</p>
<p>stand earn orationem.
</p>
<p>3. Dehortantur. The indicative is used here, in the place of the
</p>
<p>subjunctive dehortentur, to impart more force and certainty to the
</p>
<p>sentence. Render the whole clause as follows : M Did not, O Ro-
</p>
<p>mans, my zeal for the public welfare overcome even* other consid-
</p>
<p>eration, many things would dissuade me from espousing your cause."
</p>
<p>If dehor tar entur and supcrarent had been employed, the meaning
</p>
<p>would have been : " Had not a regard, &c. overcome every other
</p>
<p>consideration, many things would have dissuaded me," &c
</p>
<p>4. His annis quindcnm. Twenty-two years had in fact elapsed
</p>
<p>since the death of Tiberius Gracchus, and ten since that of his
</p>
<p>brother Caius. Sallust, if the reading be correct, takes a kind ot
</p>
<p>middle period between the two dates.  Quam ludibrio fucritis.
</p>
<p>"What a sport you have been," i. e. with what insolent scorn
</p>
<p>you have been treated.  Yestri defensores. Alluding particularly
</p>
<p>to the Gracchi.
</p>
<p>5. Ut vobis, &c. -'To what a degree your spirit lias become
</p>
<p>enfeebled by cowardice and sloth "  Ignacia properly denotes slow-
</p>
<p>ness and want of spirit in accomplishing what is already begun ; se-
</p>
<p>cordia, want of heart to begin, slowness in deliberating, &c.
</p>
<p>6. Obnoxiis inimicis. " When your enemies are in your power,"
</p>
<p>i.e. in consequence of their corruption and guilt (ob noxam.)

<p>7. Certe ego libertatcm, &c. The idea intended to be conveyed
</p>
<p>is this : If I cannot break the power of the opposite faction, I still will
</p>
<p>try to preserve my own freedom. That freedom is the inheritance I
</p>
<p>received from my fathers ; it is my own property, and I will enjoy it

<p>as my own, but then I must be aided in this by you. Certe ma

<p>will depend entirely on them whether he succeed in his attempt to

<p>nature of the enterprise. There will be no need of arms, no need O \
</p>
<p>of a secession, &c. When he speaks of asserting his own freedom,
</p>
<p>he means of course theirs also, only this way of expressing himself
</p>
<p>is more calculated to arouse their feelings.
</p>
<p>10. Secessione. Three secessions of the people are recorded in
</p>
<p>Roman history. The first took place, A. U. C. 260, on account of
</p>
<p>the severity of creditors, and was made to the sacred mount. The
</p>
<p>second was occasioned by the conduct of Appius Claudius, the
</p>
<p>decemvir, and was made first to the Aventine, and afterwards to
</p>
<p>the sacred mount. It happened, A. U. C. 305. The third was pro-
</p>
<p>duced by the same cause as the first, and was made to the Janicu-
</p>
<p>lum, A. U. C. 466.
</p>
<p>11. Suomet more. " In their own way," i. e. by the natural con-
</p>
<p>sequences of their vices and crimes.
</p>
<p>12. Quaestiones habitae sunt. " Severe investigations were in-
</p>
<p>stituted." Velleius Paterculus (2, 6.) informs us, that after the
</p>
<p>murder of Tiberius Gracchus, the consuls Rutilius and Popilius
</p>
<p>pursued very cruel and vigorous measures against the partisans of

<p>that individual.  Post C. Gracchi et M. Fulvii caedem, &c. Con-

</p>
<p>ing at supreme power (on the part of the Gracchi) to attempt the
</p>
<p>restoration of their rights to the people. Let whatever cannot
</p>
<p>be punished without shedding the blood of Roman citizens, have
</p>
<p>been justly done."  Ulcisci is here used passively, and nequitur is
</p>
<p>the passive form put, by an archaism, for ncquit. The passage be-
</p>
<p>fore us is an ironical concession on the part of Memmius, and the
</p>
<p>train of ideas is as follows : I admit that the Gracchi, in seeking to
</p>
<p>restore the rights of the Roman people, were in fact only aiming at
</p>
<p>sovereign power. I am willing to allow, that the nobility, in punish-
</p>
<p>ing with death the attempts of the Gracchi and their partisans, acted

<p>22 to denote continuance. The common, but less emphatic form,

<p>4. Occidisse tribunos plebis. " The having put to death tri-
</p>

</p>
<p>cacdcm in vosfccissc, a little after. The allusion is to the Gracchi.
</p>
<p>The persons of the tribunes were sacred, and whoever injured one
</p>
<p>of these magistrates in word or deed was held accursed, and his
</p>
<p>property was confiscated
</p>
<p>5. Quacstioncsiniquas. " Iniquitous prosecutions.''  Pcssumc.
</p>
<p>The adverbs pcssumc and maxumc have heie the force of compara-
</p>
<p>tives. The comparative is often used for the superlative in Latin ;
</p>
<p>the construction of the superlative for the comparative is much more
</p>
<p>rare.
</p>
<p>6. Mctum a scclcrc suo, &c. The meaning intended to be con-
</p>
<p>veyed is this : the fear which the nobility ought to entertain on ac-
</p>
<p>count of their crimes, they have made you feel, because you are too
</p>
<p>spiritless to oppose them.  Inter malos f actio. " It is faction when

<p>The Aventine was the most extensive of all the hills on which Rome
</p>
<p>was built. It received its name from an Alban king, who was
</p>
<p>buried on it, and was the spot which Remus chose to take the
</p>
<p>omens. On this last account it was generally regarded as a place
</p>
<p>of evil omen ; and, therefore, according to Aulus Gellius, was not
</p>
<p>included within the Pomacrium. But other and better authorities
</p>
<p>make it to have been joined to the city by Ancus Martius. Com-

<p>though used, notwithstanding, by some of the best writers. Compare

<p>5. Quantum importunitatis habent. Complete the construction
</p>
<p>as follows : Pro tanta import unit ate quantum importunitatis habent.
</p>
<p>" Such is their overbearing insolence." Precisely analogous to this
</p>
<p>is the use of the relative in such phrases as the following : " Quae
</p>
<p>tua est virtus expugjiabis," i. e. ea virtute, quae virtus tua est,
</p>
<p>expugnabis. " Such is your valour," &c. So again, " cujus est,
</p>
<p>hnitatis Galba promisit.^ M Galba, with his usual lenity, pro-
</p>
<p>mised," i. e. ea lenitate cujus est lenitatis.

<p>The term stirps properly denotes that part of the trunk of a tree

<p>5. Mover e. Some editions have moveri, but the manuscripts m
</p>
<p>general favour the active form. The construction, though a harsh
</p>
<p>one, is characteristic of Sallust. Movcre governs omnia under-
</p>
<p>stood, and omnia expressed is the accusative before senescere. The
</p>
<p>meaning is, that the consul " wished to throw all things into confu-

<p>pose.

<p>2*7 Vid. Geographical Index. The cohort, when full, consisted of 600
</p>
<p>men. The usual number, however, about the time of Polybius,
</p>
<p>was 420.
</p>
<p>3. Centurio primi pili. "The chief centurion." Each Roman
</p>
<p>legion was divided into ten cohorts ; each cohort into three maniples,
</p>
<p>and each maniple into two centuries. So that there were thirty
</p>
<p>maniples and sixty centuries in a legion. There were two centu-
</p>
<p>rions in each maniple, called by the same name, but distinguished
</p>
<p>by the title prior, " former," and posterior, " latter," because the
</p>
<p>one was chosen and ranked before the other. The centurion of the
</p>
<p>first century of the first maniple of the Triarii, was called centurio
</p>
<p>primi pili, or pi'imus pilus, or primopilus, &c. He presided over
</p>
<p>all the other centurions, and had the charge of the eagle (aquila) or
</p>
<p>chief standard of the legion ; whereby he obtained both profit and
</p>
<p>dignity, being ranked among the equites, and having a place in the
</p>
<p>council of war with the consul and tribunes of the soldiers. The
</p>
<p>centurion of the second century of the first maniple of the Triarii
</p>
<p>was called primi pi J us posterior. So the two centurions of the second
</p>
<p>maniple of the Triarii were called prior centurio, and posterior ccji-
</p>
<p>turio, secundipili ; and so on to the tenth, the two centurions of which
</p>
<p>were styled centurio dccimi pili prior, and posterior. In like manner,
</p>
<p>primus princeps prior, and posterior ; secundus princeps prior,
</p>
<p>and posterior, in speaking of the pnncipes or second rank ; and
</p>
<p>primus hastatus, &c, in reference to the hastati or first rank.
</p>
<p>Thus there was a large field for promotion in the Roman army :
</p>
<p>from a common soldier to a centurion ; and from being the lowest
</p>
<p>centurion of the tenth maniple of the hastati (decimus hastatus pos-
</p>
<p>terior) to the rank of primipilus.

<p>marking the instrument, or means which effected the exchange, the
</p>
<p>fear of death compelling the Roman soldiery to this disgraceful step.
</p>
<p>Some editions have nutabant, "they wavered," or " were irreso-

<p>of the Roman armies. They were not, however, embodied in the

<p>legions, and were treated with more severity than Roman citizens,

<p>being puni&hed with stripes, and also capitally, from which citizens
</p>
<p>were exempted by the Porcian law.  The Socii mentioned in the

<p>popular feeling were made to supply its place.
</p>
<p>OQ 1. Mos partium popularium, &c. "The custom of having a
</p>
<p>popular party, and another in the senate," i. e. the existence of a
</p>
<p>popular and an aristocratic party. The plural is here employed
</p>
<p>(partium factionum) not for the purpose of showing that there were
</p>
<p>several distinct parties among the people and senate, but that from
</p>
<p>this time the people and senate respectively formed themselves into
</p>
<p>parties against each other. As the words mos partium would alone
</p>
<p>suffice to convey the meaning of Sallust, some editors reject the
</p>
<p>remainder of the clause popularium, et senati factionum.
</p>
<p>2. Malarum artium. " Evil practices."  Paucis ante annis.
</p>
<p>Carthage had been destroyed thirty-five years before the breaking
</p>
<p>out of the Jugurthine war.  Metus hostilis. " Fear of their
</p>
<p>enemies." Put for metus hostium.  Scilicet. Used here as an
</p>
<p>explanatory particle. Hence the clause may be rendered as folio
</p>
<p>" Those effects which prosperity is accustomed to produce, licen-
</p>
<p>tiousness, namely, and pride, came naturally upon them," i. e.
</p>
<p>licentiousness and pride, the usual attendants of prosperity, natu-
</p>
<p>rally made their appearance.
</p>
<p>3. Asperius acerbiusque fuit. Understand quam ipsae res
</p>
<p>adversae fuerant. " Proved a harsher and more galling visitation
</p>
<p>than adversity itself had been." The res adversae allude to the
</p>
<p>reverses in the second Punic war.
</p>
<p>4. Dignitatem, &c. What grammarians call a zeugma takes
</p>
<p>place in lubidinem, which has one meaning when connected with
</p>
<p>dignitatem, and another with Ubcrtatem. Render the whole clause
</p>
<p>as follows : " For the nobility began to convert their high rank into
</p>
<p>an instrument of tyranny, the people to degrade their freedom into
</p>
<p>licentiousness."
</p>
<p>5. Ducere, trahere, rapere. u Dishonestly acquired, dragged
</p>
<p>away, made plunder of, every thing." These words, arranged as

</p>
<p>correctly, as we conceive.  Permixtio chilis, &c. " A civil com-
</p>

</p>
<p>dissatisfied with this intermediate rank, and had a strong inclination

<p>for an alliance with the nobilitv and admission to senatorian honours.

<p>colonies." Colonies were commonly led out and planted by three
</p>
<p>commissioners, (tnumviri). Sometimes five, ten, or more were
</p>
<p>appointed. The people determined in what way the lands were to
</p>
<p>be divided, and to whom they were to be assigned. The new co-r
</p>
<p>lony inarched to its destined place in the form of an army, wit!)

<p>30 hardly required by the idiom of the language. Sallust does not
</p>
<p>mean that Metellus neglected the other duties of the consulship, in
</p>
<p>order to give his whole attention to the war, supposing that his col-
</p>
<p>league would attend to every thing else : but that he foresaw he
</p>
<p>could not expect much assistance from him, in these warlike prepa-
</p>
<p>rations, and therefore paid more attention to them himself, though
</p>
<p>without neglecting, at the same time, his general duties as a consul.
</p>
<p>6. Bello vario. " In a war, exposed to various contingencies."
</p>
<p>The nature of the country , which was to be the scene of operations,
</p>
<p>and the character of the foe, are here alluded to.  Ad ea patranda,
</p>
<p>&c. " For the accomplishment of these things, the allies and the

</p>
<p>not to be subdued by avarice.

</p>
<p>" Acting (or commanding) in the stead of the consul." Some edi-

<p>tions read a Sp. Albino.  Sine wxperio et modestia habitus. " Kept

<p>3. Dcducebantur. In the sense here of diducebantur. Render
</p>
<p>the clause as follows : " Besides, the watches were not distributed
</p>
<p>according to military usage."  Lixae. ''The followers of the
</p>
<p>camp." Cortius makes lixae mean here all manner of disorderly
</p>
<p>persons. Festus defines the lixae as follows : " Lixae, qui $gt

<p>prefers deriving the term from elixare, "to cook," in allusion to Q1
</p>
<p>their preparing the food of the soldiers. Independently of its refer-
</p>
<p>ring to the soldiers' servants and to the sutlers, the name appears
</p>
<p>to have been occasionally also applied to buffoons. This last mean-
</p>
<p>ing of the word rests on a passage in Justin, (38, 10,) where, un-
</p>
<p>der the general name of lixae, are comprehended coqui, pistores,
</p>
<p>and scenici. Justin is speaking of the army which Antiochus led
</p>
<p>against the Parthians : u Sed luxuriae non minor apparatus, quam
</p>
<p>militiae fuit : quippe octoginta millia armaiorum secuta sunt trecenta

</p>
<p>4. Villas. " Country-seats."  Panem mercari. This was in
</p>
<p>violation of the strict rules of military discipline. Besides his pay,
</p>
<p>each soldier received a certain allowance of corn, commonly four
</p>
<p>pecks (modn) a month. This they were to grind, sift, and prepare
</p>
<p>for bread themselves, and afterwards bake it with their own hands.
</p>
<p>The centurions received a double, and the cavalry a triple, allow*
</p>
<p>ance. (Lipsius, adPolyb. 5. Dial. 16.)
</p>
<p>5. Quaecumque ignaviae luxuriaeque probra. " Whatever dis-
</p>
<p>graceful excesses, the results of idleness and licentiousness."  Et
</p>
<p>alia amplius. " And others besides."
</p>
<p>6. Tanta temper antia, &c. '} Regulated as he was in his deport-
</p>
<p>ment, with so much moderation, between a desire to gain popularity
</p>
<p>on the one hand, and rigid discipline on the other," i. e. preserving
</p>
<p>in his deportment a well-regulated medium between these two ex-
</p>
<p>tremes.  Namque edicto, &c. Sustulisse, in this clause, and sta-

<p>O I place. The form of the camp was square. In later ages, in imita-
</p>
<p>tion of the Greeks, they sometimes made it circular, or adapted it
</p>
<p>to the nature of the ground. The ditch was usually nine feet deep,
</p>
<p>and twelve feet broad. The vallum was composed of the earth
</p>
<p>dug from the ditch, and secured and kept firm by stakes.
</p>
<p>8. Circumire. " He went the rounds." In general, certain per-
</p>
<p>sons were appointed every night to go round the watches, hence
</p>
<p>called circuitores or circitores. This seems to have been at first
</p>
<p>done by the equites and tnbuni ; on extraordinary occasions, as in
</p>
<p>the present instance, by the commander in person, attended by his
</p>
<p>legati. Subsequently, regular persons were chosen for that pur-
</p>
<p>pose by the tribuni. (Vcgetius, 3, 8.)

<p>2. Innocentia. " His incorruptible integrity.''  Cum sujrpliciis.
</p>
<p>" With the emblems of submission." By supplicia, in this sense
</p>
<p>are usually meant branches of olive. The customs, however, of
</p>
<p>different nations varied in this respect. According to the scholiast
</p>
<p>on Sophocles, (Oed. T. 3,) petitioners among the Greeks, usually
</p>
<p>carried boughs wrapped around with fillets of wool. Sometimes
</p>
<p>the hands were covered with these fillets, not only among the
</p>
<p>Greeks, but also among the Romans. Hence in Plautus, (Amph.
</p>
<p>1, 1, 101,) we have the expression M relatis manibus. % '

</p>
<p>tarc. " To carry his provisions," i. e. to furnish vehicles for the
</p>
<p>transportation of his provisions. The advantage resulting to Me-
</p>
<p>tellus from this offer, would be the releasing the diers from a
</p>
<p>part of the heavy loads they were accustomed to carrv. The
</p>
<p>strict rule was, that each soldier should carry provisions for fifteen
</p>
<p>days. The whole load of a Roman soldier was sixty pounds, ex-
</p>
<p>clusive of his arms. These last he was taught by active and severe
</p>
<p>exercise to consider a part of himself.

<p>an ambuscade was sought by the enemy," i. e. that the enemy were *J2
</p>
<p>only seeking a spot where they might entrap him, when thrown off
</p>
<p>his guard by these marks of submission. Most editions read ten-
</p>
<p>tare. Cortius understands before this last homines quosdam, or
</p>
<p>something equivalent. Others make tentare the historical infinitive,
</p>
<p>and refer it to Metellus. According to both these explanations,
</p>
<p>however, the reading tentare would seem to want spirit.
</p>
<p>6. Velitcs. " The light- armed troops." They were first insti-
</p>
<p>tuted in the second Punic war, according to Livy (26, 4). They
</p>
<p>did not form part of the legion, and had no certain post assigned
</p>
<p>them, but fought in scattered parties where occasion required,
</p>
<p>usually before the lines.  Perniciosior. " More mischievous," or
</p>
<p>" hurtful."
</p>
<p>7. Forum renim venalium, &c. " The most frequented mart,
</p>
<p>for buying and selling commodities, in the whole kingdom." Sal-
</p>
<p>lust here, by his use of the term forum, imitates the Roman way of
</p>
<p>speaking. The word forum, when applied to towns, meant places
</p>
<p>where markets were held, and where justice also was administered.
</p>
<p>The reference in the text is to the first part of this meaning, namely
</p>
<p>Vaga's being a market-town and place of trade.
</p>
<p>1. Huic consul, &c. We have here followed the reading of the QQ
</p>
<p>Bipont edition, which alone appears to afford an intelligible meaning
</p>
<p>for this much-contested passage. The phrase huic praesidium im-
</p>
<p>fosuit is the true Latin idiom, though, in translating it into our own,
</p>
<p>we are compelled to give huic the force of an ablative. The mean-
</p>
<p>ing of the passage will be as follows : "In this place, the consul
</p>
<p>stationed a garrison, as well for the sake of trying Jugurtha, as
</p>
<p>of watching the result of his own plans, in case the advantages
</p>
<p>which the placo afforded should allow this to be done," i. e. for the
</p>
<p>sake of sounding the real intentions of Jugurtha, and of ascertaining
</p>
<p>whether he actually desired peace or was only seeking to lay an
</p>
<p>ambuscade, and also of watching the result of his own plans for the

<p>trial, the place should prove as advantageous for these two objects
</p>
<p>as he expected it would.
</p>
<p>2. Frequcntiam negotiatorum, &c. " That the great number of
</p>
<p>merchants residing there, would both aid his army with supplies,
</p>
<p>and be a means of security to the conquests he had already made,"
</p>
<p>i. e. would both readily procure supplies for his army, and, when
</p>
<p>once they had brought their property into the town for that purpose,
</p>
<p>would be willing to defend it with him against Jugurtha. We have
</p>

<p>some editions et peditibus dcleciis. Our reading is more after the
</p>
<p>manner of Sallust.  Turmas atque manipulos. The expressions
</p>
<p>turmae and manipuli are here employed by Sallust, either to denote
</p>
<p>that Jugurtha had introduced the Roman discipline among his troops,
</p>
<p>or else in accordance with the general custom of Roman writers,
</p>
<p>who apply to other nations terms and modes of expressions which
</p>
<p>only suit themselves.

<p>34 1. Decuer'nit. Understand providcri.  Locum superiorcm. Ju-
</p>
<p>gurtha enumerates four particulars, in which, like a good general,
</p>
<p>he had provided that his troops should have the advantage. 1. Lo-

</p>
<p>rent. A better knowledge of the country than that possessed by 34
</p>
<p>the enemy. 3. Ne pauciores cum pluribus. No inferiority of num-
</p>
<p>bers. 4. Aut rudes cum hello melioribus. No want of discipline.
</p>
<p> Render prudentes, " they, acquainted with the country before-
</p>
<p>hand."
</p>
<p>2. Ut quemque, &c. " As he had distinguished any one, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of some military exploit, w T ith a gift of money or with promo-
</p>
<p>tion in the army."
</p>
<p>3. Conspicatur. Thus far Sallust has shown us Jugurtha, ac-
</p>
<p>tively employed among his followers. He now changes the picture,
</p>
<p>and presents us with Metellus, ignorant of the position of the foe.
</p>
<p>descending the mountain, and merely observing something that
</p>
<p>wore an unusual appearance on the neighbouring hill. Hence we see
</p>
<p>the propriety of conspicatur (" espies something" on the hill) as a
</p>
<p>reading, instead of the common lection, conspicitur (" is seen" by the
</p>
<p>enemy). Metellus saw something on the hill, but it was too unde-
</p>
<p>fined to enable him to ascertain its nature with any kind of certainty
</p>
<p>until he came nearer.
</p>
<p>4. Quidnam insolita fades ostcnderet. " What the strange ap-
</p>
<p>pearance meant."  Equi Numidaeque. " The Numidians, both
</p>
<p>horse and foot." Thus equi virique signifies both horsemen and
</p>
<p>infantry.
</p>
<p>5. Incerti, quidnam esset. " Leaving it uncertain what the thing
</p>
<p>actually was," i. e. not entirely discernible. The tenn incerti refers
</p>
<p>of course to the Numidians. The adjective certus is derived from
</p>
<p>cerno and res incerta is nothing more than res non bene et distincte
</p>
<p>visa. The primitive meaning therefore oiincertus is " about which
</p>
<p>there is no certainty," " undefined," " not clearly discernible." And
</p>
<p>it is used so in the present instance. Compare the Greek form of
</p>
<p>expression, aSr>\oi ri totc tovt' av Inn.
</p>
<p>6. Agmcn constitit. " He halted his army." Consisto, although
</p>
<p>apparently a neuter verb in most cases, is in reality active ; thus

</p>
<p>constitit, " he stopped," understand se. In the present instance, the
</p>
<p>accusative agmcn is expressed, and the common reading constituit
</p>
<p>is not needed. Compare Cacs. B. C. 1, 51. "Afranius copias
</p>
<p>educit, et in medio colle sub castris constitit.'' 1
</p>
<p>7. Commutatis ordinibus. " Having altered the arrangement of
</p>
<p>his troops." Jugurtha, it will be recollected, had drawn up his
</p>
<p>forces on the hill, which extended in the direction of the river, and
</p>
<p>at right angles to the mountain. Metellus was descending this
</p>
<p>mountain in order to reach the river, and consequently had Jugur-
</p>
<p>tha's ambuscade on his right flank. Thus far the Roman army would
</p>
<p>appear, from chapter 46, to have been marching in a single column,
</p>
<p>166 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>34 each legion composing that column being divided, in the usual man-
</p>
<p>ner, into three ranks of hastati, principes, and triarii. The moment
</p>
<p>Metellus perceives his danger, he converts his flank into a front, by
</p>
<p>wheeling the legions out of column into line on the right, and by
</p>
<p>bringing all the hastati of the several legions into one line ; all the
</p>
<p>principes into a second line, and all the triarii into a third. The
</p>
<p>army is then drawn up in three lines, (triplicibus subsidiis,) with its
</p>
<p>front facing the enemy. But how is it to reach the plain 1 Evi-
</p>
<p>dently by a flank march on the left, and in this flank march the
</p>
<p>three ranks become so many files. Each soldier, therefore, when
</p>
<p>the word is given to continue the march down the mountain, faces
</p>
<p>to the left and moves on in file. If the enemy attacks them on
</p>
<p>their march, they face again to the front and oppose them. Compare,
</p>
<p>in further explanation of this movement, Polybius, (Lips, de Milit.
</p>
<p>Rom. lib. 5, dial. 12). 'JLireiSav TrpoairiiTTri ri nov Seivuiv, ttotI [ilv trap 1

<p>8. Triplicibus subsidiis. " In three lines. " The term subsidia,
</p>
<p>which properly denotes " bodies of reserve," is here applied to the
</p>
<p>several lines, with reference to the mutual support which they afford
</p>
<p>to each other.
</p>
<p>9. Inter manipulos. " In the vacant spaces between the mani-
</p>
<p>ples."  Transvorsis principiis. " Having converted the front into
</p>
<p>a flank." Consult note 7.
</p>
<p>10. Conficeretur. "Might be distressed."  Transvorsis prae-
</p>
<p>His. "By attacks on his flank."  Lassitudinem et sitvn, <Scc.
</p>
<p>" Would try the effects of weariness and thirst on his men."
</p>
<p>11. Sicuti monte dcsccndcrat. " In the same order in which he
</p>
<p>had descended from the mountain."  Post p r incipa l. " In the cen-
</p>
<p>tre." Literally, " after the van." By the new movement of Me-
</p>
<p>tellus, the cavalry of the left wing became the leading division on the
</p>
<p>march, and are hence called principes. The station of Marius
</p>
<p>was after the cavalry and the heads of the columns of infantry,

<p>and consequently about the centre of the line of march.  Pre-
</p>
<p>cipes. " The leading division." This term must not be con-
</p>
<p>founded with the usual designation of the first rank of the Roman
</p>
<p>army.

</p>
<p>" Merccdem. quasi talcnta ad quindecim coegi"

<p>2. Postremos. By postremi are here meant the soldiers of the
</p>
<p>right wing, who are called the rear in reference to the direction of

</p>
<p>These words refer to a state of things immediately following a new 35
</p>
<p>movement on the part of the Romans, and of which movement Sal-
</p>
<p>lust says nothing, leaving it to be inferred by the reader. "When
</p>
<p>the Romans were first attacked by the enemy, they were proceeding
</p>
<p>in a long column down to the plain, having wheeled into that order
</p>
<p>from the previous line of march. Hence by primi, in this new
</p>
<p>arrangement, are meant those who formed the left wing in the old
</p>
<p>order of things, and by posiremi, those who composed the old right.
</p>
<p>The primi of Jugurtha's men, on the other hand, are the left wing
</p>
<p>of the Numidians as they lie in ambuscade. The Numidians attack
</p>
<p>the postremi of Metellus, (postremos caedcre,) and the moment this
</p>
<p>attack is made on the Roman flank, it faces to the right and forms
</p>
<p>a front against the enemy. This is the movement of which Sal-
</p>
<p>lust says nothing. "When it is made, the head and rear of the Ro-
</p>
<p>man column become respectively a new left and right wing, and
</p>
<p>the Numidians attack them on each of these new flanks, (pars a
</p>
<p>sinistra acdextera tentare.)
</p>
<p>3. Ludificati incerto praelio. " Baffled by this irregular mode of
</p>
<p>fighting."  Ipsi modo eminus sauciabantur. " "Were themselves
</p>
<p>alone wounded from a distance," i. e. they could not wound the
</p>
<p>enemy in return.
</p>
<p>4. Numero priores. " Being superior in number." Referring
</p>
<p>to the Numidians.  Disjcctos ab tergo aut lateribus. The terms
</p>
<p>tergum and latus are here applied not to the entire Roman
</p>
<p>army, but merely to the parties or bands which pursued the Nu-
</p>
<p>midians.
</p>
<p>5. Ea. The ablative. Understand fuga, and render as follows :

</p>
<p>mence a new march, with the chance of a second battle, thev never-

<p>tween Rutilius and Bomilcar

</p>
<p>as soldiers."- -Ita s-e mores habent. " Such is their national usage."
</p>
<p>More literally, " so the habits of the nation have themselves." This
</p>
<p>custom of abandoning their general after a defeat is always charac-
</p>
<p>teristic of a semi-barbarous nation, and was of constant occurrence
</p>
<p>among the uncivilized communities of antiquity.
</p>
<p>9. Ferocem. "Unsubdued."  Ex illius lubidme. "According
</p>
<p>to his pleasure." Jugurtha was enabled, by retreating rapidly to

</p>
<p>to give the enemy an opportunity of fighting only when he himself
</p>
<p>pleased.  Iniquum. "Unequal."  No?i praeliis neque acie. "Not

<p>2. Plerumque. Agreeing with exercitum. This adjective is
</p>
<p>rarely used in the singular. In early Latinity, plerus,  a,  urn,

</p>
<p>5. Supplicia. " A thanksgiving." When a general had obtained
</p>
<p>an important victory, a thanksgiving was decreed by the senate to
</p>
<p>be made in the various temples. What was called a Lectisternium
</p>
<p>then took place, when couches were spread for the gods, as if about
</p>
<p>to feast, and their statues were taken down from their pedestals,

<p>and placed upon these couches around the altars, which were loaded
</p>
<p>with the richest dishes.
</p>
<p>6. Laeta agere. " Gave loose to joy," i. e. agebat laeta negotia,
</p>
<p>equivalent in fact to laeta erat. The term gaudium denotes prop-
</p>
<p>erly the feeling of joy, or joy of a comparatively moderate kind.
</p>
<p>Laetitia refers to the expression of joy, by words and gestures, and
</p>
<p>hence is much stronger in meaning than gaudium. A similar dif-
</p>
<p>ference exists between gaudcre and laetari.

</p>
<p> Cohortes. Referring to the cohorts of the allies. If the legionary
</p>
<p>troops had been meant, the term legioncs, or the expression cohortes
</p>
<p>legionariae would have been employed.  Praesidium agitabant.
</p>
<p>" Acted as a convoy." Formed a convoy or guard. Equivalent

<p>2. Perfugis. The term perfuga denotes a deserter from our

</p>
<p>pare the remark of Popma : " Transfuga suos relinquit et ad alios

</p>
<p>gurtha, and go back to the Romans, because they were sure of re-
</p>
<p>ceiving from the latter the severest punishment. Hence Jugurtha
</p>
<p>had no fear of their abandoning his standard, and rejoining their
</p>
<p>countrymen. Valerius Maximus speaks of deserters having been

<p>others who were exposed to wild beasts by the younger Africanus ;
</p>
<p>and of others whom Paulus Aemilius ordered to be trampled under
</p>
<p>foot by elephants, (2, 7). Hence it follows, that the punishment

<p>of deserters was left to the pleasure of the commander.

<p>and ardentia (" all on fire") is put in the neuter gender as referring
</p>
<p>to sudes, pila and taedam, things without life. The pila had com-

<p>6. Ad se vorsum. For advorsum se.  Popularis esse. " That
</p>
<p>they were his own men." Literally, "his countrymen."  Statim.
</p>
<p>This adverb is not redundant here as some imagine. Metellus first
</p>
<p>quickly despatched the cavalry, and, immediately after, Marius with
</p>
<p>the allied cohorts.

<p>the cavalry, of the Numidians.  Advorsis equis concurrcre, &c.
</p>
<p>" Charged straight onward, disordered and broke our line."  Hostis
</p>
<p>paene victos dare. After the Numidian cavalry had broken the
</p>
<p>Roman line, they gave the enemy, now almost conquered, into the
</p>
<p>hands of their light-armed infantry, who were intermingled with

<p>the horse. The Romans, it will be perceived, are here again called

<p>3. Niti. Referring to the Roman soldiery.  Paritcr. " "With
</p>
<p>equal energy."  Oppugnare aut parare, &c. The former of these

<p>8. Unae. This numeral is used in the plural with nouns which
</p>
<p>have no singular, or are used in a different sense in that number ;
</p>
<p>or else, whose singular is of rare occurrence. Thus, una moenia,
</p>
<p>una castra, unae liter ae, &c. In the present instance the singular
</p>
<p>number of scala is rarely, if ever, met with, and hence the plural
</p>
<p>form is employed. Charisius, Diomedes, and other grammarians,
</p>
<p>maintain that the singular of this word is never used. Compare
</p>
<p>Quintilian, 1, 5, 16 :  " Scala tamen et scopa, ccmtraque hordea et
</p>
<p>mulsa, licet Uterarum mutationcm, detractionem, adjectioncm non
</p>
<p>habcant, non alio vitiosa sunt quam quod pluralia singularitcr, et
</p>
<p>singulana pluraliter effcruntur." Celsus, however, (8. 15,) uses
</p>
<p>the singular of scala : thus, u Sic brachium deligatum super scalae
</p>
<p>gallinariae gradum trajicitur ;" and also Caius, {Dig. lib. 46. tit.

<p>7. Argenti pondo ducenta millia. " Two hundred thousand

<p>174 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>43 1- Ad imperandum. The gerund is here used, according to the
</p>
<p>grammarians, in the passive sense, " for the purpose of being or*
</p>
<p>dered," i. e. " of receiving orders." A few other passages occur,
</p>
<p>in the Latin writers now extant, in which the gerund is similarly
</p>
<p>employed. In the present instance, however, an active meaning,
</p>
<p>though not a very elegant one, may be given to imperandum, " for
</p>
<p>the purpose of an ordering of him on the part of Metellus," i. e.
</p>
<p>" for the purpose of Metellus's ordering him." In this same way,
</p>
<p>perhaps, the other instances may be explained. Thus, Nep. Att. 9,
</p>
<p>" Spes restituendi nulla erat." " There was no hope of his being
</p>
<p>restored," i. e. " of a restoring of him;" and again, Justin, 17, 5,
</p>
<p>" Athenas erudiendi gratia missus." " He was sent to Athens, for
</p>
<p>the sake of being instructed," i. e. for an instructing of himself.
</p>
<p>2. Fleeter e animum suum. "To change his resolve." To
</p>
<p>waver.
</p>
<p>3. Multis magnisque praesidiis. "Many and great resources."
</p>
<p>Money, horses, arms, elephants.
</p>
<p>4. Numidiam Metello decreverat. Metellus's consulship having
</p>
<p>expired, he was continued in command another year, as proconsul,
</p>
<p>and the province of Numidia was voted to him by the senate. The
</p>
<p>consuls for this year (A. U. C. 646.) were Servius Sulpicius Galba
</p>
<p>and Q. Hortensius, in the place of which latter M. Aurelius
</p>
<p>Scaurus was afterwards chosen.
</p>
<p>5. C. Mario. Marius was a complete slave to superstition, as
</p>
<p>might well be expected in an ignorant and uneducated man. Plu-
</p>
<p>tarch and Frontinus both make mention of a Syrian woman, named
</p>
<p>Martha, whom he carried about with him, and who, as he pretended,
</p>
<p>and very likely believed, was possessed of the gift of prophecy.
</p>
<p>6. Agitabat. " He was meditating."  Cuncta prospera even-
</p>
<p>tura. The adjective prospera is here used adverbially. Compare
</p>
<p>Catiline, chap. 26. "Quae occulte tentaverat, aspera foedaque
</p>
<p>evenerant."

<p>7. Praeter vetustatem familiae. " Except antiquity of family."
</p>
<p>Noble birth.  Alia omnia. "All other qualifications."  Animus
</p>
<p>belli ingens, &c. "A spirit intrepid in war, moderate in peace."
</p>
<p>This animus domi modicus underwent a change, when, as will be
</p>
<p>seen in a subsequent chapter, ambitione praeceps datus est.
</p>
<p>8. His natus. Understand virtutibus after his. Most editions
</p>
<p>read Sed is, natus, &c. The lection we have adopted, however,
</p>
<p>appears decidedly preferable, as marking the contrast between the
</p>
<p>early and later periods of Marius's life.

<p>making campaigns."

</p>
<p>10. Urbanis munditiis. " The luxurious refinements of a city AQ
</p>
<p>life." These are enlarged upon by Marius in the course of his
</p>
<p>speech before the people, chap. 85.  Inter artis bonas. " Amid
</p>
<p>manly practices." By a course of manly discipline.
</p>
<p>11. Plerisque faciem ejus ignorantibus. The reason of this
</p>
<p>was, because he had been born and brought up out of the city, and
</p>
<p>been always hitherto conversant with camps and warfare."  Facile
</p>
<p>notus. " Being easily recognised by name." At first, no one
</p>
<p>knew who the candidate was : but when his name, Caius Marius,
</p>
<p>was heard, he was easily recognised by the people as a brave and
</p>
<p>gallant soldier.
</p>
<p>12. Per omnis tribus. The tribes were, at this period, thirty-
</p>
<p>five in number. Compare Livy, 33, 25.
</p>
<p>13. In potestatibus . " In the exercise of authority."  Ampliore.
</p>
<p>" Of a higher office."
</p>
<p>14. Ad id locorum. " Up to that time." Locus is here used
</p>
<p>for tempus. Compare chapter 72. " Post id locorum" i. e. postea.
</p>
<p>So Terence uses interea loci for interea, and Plautus interibi.
</p>
<p>15. His. "By these," i. e. the nobility.
</p>
<p>16. Cupido animi. " His ambitious feelings."  Petundi. Sup-
</p>
<p>ply consulatum.  Missionem. " Leave of absence." A furlough.
</p>
<p>1. Contemtor animus. " A disdainful spirit."  Tarn prava. " So A A
</p>
<p>erroneous a line of conduct."
</p>
<p>2. Jure. " With good reason." On account of his low birth,
</p>
<p>and want of proper education.
</p>
<p>3. Ubi primum, &c. " As soon as he should be allowed to do
</p>
<p>this, by the state of public affairs," i. e. as soon as he, Marius,
</p>
<p>could be spared from the army.
</p>
<p>4. Satis mature. " Soon enough."  Cum filio suo. With his
</p>
<p>(Metellus's) son," i. e. when his son should be old enough to stand
</p>
<p>candidate along with him  Contubernio patris. "In the tent of
</p>
<p>his father." Contubernium properly denotes a certain number of

<p>soldiers quartered in the same tent. Hence young noblemen, un-
</p>
<p>der the general's particular care, were said to serve or live in his
</p>
<p>tent (contubernio ejus militare) and were called his contubernales.
</p>
<p>5. Annos natus, &c. As the strictly legal age for obtaining the
</p>
<p>consulship was 43 years, Marius, according to the ironical advice
</p>
<p>of Metellus, would have to wait 23 years longer : and as we may
</p>
<p>suppose Marius to have been, at the time here alluded to, at least
</p>
<p>43 years, (since he entertained thoughts of then standing for the
</p>
<p>consulship,) he would have to delay his suit until he was 66 years
</p>
<p>old. Compare Plutarch's account of this same matter, at the con-
</p>
<p>clusion of note 3, page 47, of this narrative.

</p>
<p>ambition."
</p>
<p>7. Ambitiosum. " Calculated to gain popularity.''  Laxiore im-
</p>
<p>perio. " Under a more relaxed discipline."  Negotiator es. The
</p>
<p>negotiatores, especially under the republic, were they who remained
</p>
<p>for some considerable time in one particular place, whether at Rome
</p>
<p>or in the provinces. The mercatorcs, on the contrary, remained a
</p>
<p>very short time in any place ; they visited many countries, and
</p>
<p>were almost constantly occupied with importing or exporting arti-
</p>
<p>cles of merchandise.
</p>
<p>8. Criminose simul, &c. " Both in a style of accusation as re-
</p>
<p>garded Metellus, and of boasting with respect to himself."  Dimi-

</p>
<p>The epithet regiae is well calculated to arouse the indignant feelings
</p>
<p>of Romans.

<p>an ardent spirit." One impatient to attain its object.

<p>11. Secundum hercdem. By hacrcs scauidus (next or second
</p>
<p>heir) among the Romans, was meant the individual to whom the
</p>
<p>inheritance descended, if the heir or heirs who were first appointed
</p>
<p>did not choose to accept, or died under the age of puberty.
</p>
<p>12 Mente paullum immiftuta. " With his mental faculties a

<p>when he presided in a council of war, or in judgment, or gave audi-
</p>

<p>of distinction, took places around him ; and if a king happened to be

</p>
<p>with four crooked feet fixed to the extremities of cross pieces of

<p>wood, joined by a common axis, somewhat in the form of the letter
</p>
<p>X, and covered with leather ; so that it might be conveniently folded
</p>

</p>
<p>with the same fate as Massiva, who had been assassinated at Rome.

<p>of whom served in the army, while others were engaged in carrying

</p>
<p>sider, as some do, the form plebei as an old dative, where the diph-
</p>
<p>thong ei is put in the place of the long final i. If so, the genitive
</p>
<p>of plebes will be plebis, and it will be, like plebs, a noun of the third
</p>
<p>declension.
</p>
<p>4. Omissa dcditione. The narrative now returns, after this
</p>
<p>digression respecting Marius, to the state of things mentioned at
</p>
<p>the close of chapter 62.  Bellum incipit. " Begins the war anew."

<p>their turn. The meaning of the historian is, that the principal in-
</p>
<p>habitants conspired against the Romans, because they still retained
</p>
<p>an attachment to Jugurtha, and were, therefore, easily prevailed
</p>
<p>upon by his entreaties. The lower orders, however, needed no soli-

<p>citation for this purpose, as they were naturally fond of change, and
</p>
<p>impatient of repose.

<p>8. Discordiosum. " Contentious." Fond of discord and quarrels.
</p>
<p>This is supposed by some to be a word peculiar to Sallust. It

<p>the citadel."  Praesidium hostium. "A guard of the enemy

<p>stationed there."  Pro tcctis. " In front of the roofs," i. e. on the
</p>
<p>eaves of the houses.
</p>
<p>2. Anceps malum. " The evil which threatened on all sides." 
</p>
<p>Infirmissumo generi. " The feeblest portion of the human race,"

<p>i. e. women and boys.
</p>
<p>3. In eatanta asperitate. " In this so distressing a situation of
</p>
<p>affairs."  Nisi. "Except that." Equivalent to nisi quod.  In-
</p>
<p>testabilisque. " Infamous," or, "detestable." The word properly
</p>
<p>denotes one who can neither make a will, be a witness, nor receive
</p>
<p>a testamentary bequest. Sallust, in his account of the conduct of
</p>
<p>Turpilius, does not agree with Plutarch, who makes the accusation
</p>
<p>to have been a false one, and Turpilius to have been condemned
</p>
<p>through the agency of Marius. Compare note 3, page 47.

<p>veditos. "Disencumbered of baggage."  Horam tertiam. The
</p>
<p>Romans divided the natural day, or the space from sunrise to sunset,
</p>
<p>into twelve hours, which were of course shorter in winter and longer
</p>
<p>in summer. At the equinoxes, the third hour would exactly coin-
</p>
<p>cide with our ninth. The night was divided into four watches, each
</p>
<p>consisting of three hours, which were likewise of a different length
</p>
<p>at different times of the year. Thus hora sexta noctis, " midnight."

<p> Septima, "one o'clock in the morning," &c.
</p>
<p>6. Abnuentis omnia. "Entirely averse to any farther exertion.*'

<p>their unwillingness to proceed. This is extremely well indicated by fi
</p>
<p>abnuentis.
</p>
<p>7. Milk passuum. " A mile." Literally, " a thousand paces."
</p>
<p>The Roman passus, or, "pace," was equal to one yard, 1.85375
</p>
<p>feet of English measure, and, consequently, the Roman mile was
</p>
<p>1617 yards, 2.75 feet.
</p>
<p>8. Praedam benigne ostentat. " He generously offers them the
</p>
<p>booty of the place."  Inprimo. Understand agmine.  Late. The
</p>
<p>object of this arrangement was that the cavalry might conceal from
</p>
<p>view the infantry behind them.
</p>
<p>9. Numidas equites. It is now seen why these were stationed
</p>
<p>in front.  Rursum. Referring to their change of opinion. Render
</p>
<p>the clause, "having changed their opinion, and thought it was
</p>
<p>Jugurtha."
</p>
<p>1. Volgum. The ancient writers generally prefer volgum or A^
</p>
<p>vulgum, in the accusative, to volgus or vulgus.  Effusum. " That
</p>
<p>had poured out in great numbers."
</p>
<p>2. Ex perfidia. "After their treachery."  Poenae cuncta, &c.
</p>
<p>" Was entirely given up to punishment or plunder." Poenae fuit
</p>
<p>is an unusual form of expression, but does not offend when placed
</p>
<p>in the same sentence with the more usual construction praedae fuit.
</p>
<p>3. Capite poenas solvit. According to Plutarch, Turpilius and
</p>
<p>his family had long been retainers to that of Metellus, and he
</p>
<p>attended him in this war in the character of master of the artificers.
</p>
<p>Marius, who was one of the council of war that tried him, was not
</p>
<p>only himself severe against him, but stirred up most of the other
</p>
<p>judges ; so that it was carried against the opinion of Metellus, and
</p>
<p>it was much against his will that he passed upon him sentence of
</p>
<p>death. A short time afterwards, according to Plutarch, the accusa-
</p>
<p>tion appeared a false one, and all the other officers sympathized
</p>
<p>with Metellus, who was overwhelmed with sorrow ; while Marius

</p>
<p>with joy declared that the thing was all his own doing, and was not
</p>
<p>ashamed to acknowledge, in all companies, that he had lodged an
</p>
<p>avenging fury in the breast of Metellus, which would not fail to
</p>
<p>punish him for having put to death the hereditary friend of his family.
</p>
<p>Plutarch states, that after this they became more open enemies, and
</p>
<p>that the conversation between Metellus and Marius, of which
</p>
<p>Sallust makes mention in the 64th chapter of this narrative, took
</p>
<p>place subsequently to this event. According to the biographer, one
</p>
<p>day, when Marius was standing by, Metellus said by way of insult,
</p>
<p>" You are thinking, then, my good friend, of leaving us, and going
</p>
<p>home to solicit the consulship : would you not be contented to stay,
</p>
<p>and be consul with this son of mine V 1 The son of Metellus, adds

</p>
<p>4*7 Plutarch, was then very young. {Pint. Vit. Mar. c. 8. red. Hutten.
</p>
<p>vol. 3, p. 68.)
</p>
<p>4. Nam is civis ex Latio erat. It was enacted by the Porcian
</p>
<p>law, that no one should bind, scourge, or kill, a Roman citizen ; and,
</p>
<p>by the Sempronian law, that sentence should not be passed upon the
</p>
<p>life of a Roman citizen without the order of the people. It still
</p>
<p>remains a disputed point whether the operation of these laws was
</p>
<p>suspended or not in the Roman camp. The present passage of
</p>
<p>Sallust goes to prove, that the laws in question were not superseded
</p>
<p>by the military power of the consul, but remained in full force, since
</p>
<p>the words of our author fairly imply that Turpilius would not have
</p>
<p>lost his life had he been a citizen of Rome. In the days of Polybius,
</p>
<p>however, before the period of which Sallust treats, it would appear
</p>
<p>that the punishment of delinquents in the camp was not impeded by
</p>
<p>the laws mentioned above. The subject is discussed by Lipsius,
</p>
<p>{Be Mil. Rom. 5. dial. 18,) though without being brought to any
</p>
<p>definite conclusion.
</p>
<p>5. Evm suspiciens. " Suspecting him." An unusual meaning
</p>
<p>for the verb suspicio, which commonly denotes, " to look upward,"
</p>
<p>" to admire," &c. It derives its peculiar force, in the present in-
</p>
<p>stance, from its opposition to suspectus, both suspectus and suspi-
</p>
<p>ciens coming from the same verb. The common form is suspectans.
</p>
<p>6. Fatigare animum. " He wearied his invention."  Popularibus
</p>
<p>suis. " To his countrymen."  Super aver ant. " Had remained
</p>
<p>undone." More literally, "had remained over." To complete the
</p>
<p>construction we may understand agendae, but this is not necessary.
</p>
<p>7. Inter hiberna. In chapter 61 we are informed, that Metellus
</p>
<p>had fixed the winter quarters of his army in that part of the Roman
</p>
<p>province which was nearest to Numidia, and that he had besides
</p>
<p>stationed garrisons in several cities of Numidia. Hence the pro-
</p>
<p>priety of the phrase inter hiberna.

</p>
<p>speaking, the singular is here the proper form on account of the dis-

<p>junctive aut which precedes. Similar deviations, however, some-
</p>
<p>times occur in the best writers. Thus Cicero, (Or. 2, 4, 16,) " Ne

<p>antur." So Longinus, (c. 14, ed. Weiske,) ttwj av TtXaruv ?)
</p>
<p>Arj/jLoadevris vrpaxrav, jj ev laropia QovkvSiStjs. The aim of the

<p>writers, who use this construction, appears to be, to present the
</p>
<p>different objects to the mind in such a way as that they may operate

<p>^C) the consulship a long time after Marius. Some very erroneously
</p>
<p>refer tempcstates in this passage to civil dissentions, contrary to the
</p>
<p>usage of Sallust. Compare Catiline, chapter 53, " multis tempes-
</p>
<p>tatibus."
</p>
<p>3. Decreverat. " Had decreed this," i. e. the management of
</p>
<p>this war* Some editions have Numidiam expressed, which is equiva-
</p>
<p>lent. The determination of the consular provinces properly belonged
</p>
<p>to the senate. Sometimes, however, the people, as in the present
</p>
<p>instance, reversed what the senate had decreed respecting the pro-
</p>
<p>vinces. So the attempt of Marius, by means of the tribune Sul-
</p>
<p>picius, to get the command of the war against Mithridates transferred
</p>
<p>from Sylla to himself by the suffrages of the people, gave occasion
</p>
<p>to the first civil war at Rome.
</p>
<p>4. Bocchum. Bocchus was king of Mauritania. Compare chap. 19.
</p>
<p>5. Varius incertusque agitabat. Understand sese. " Was dis-
</p>
<p>tracted by a variety of schemes, and uncertain which to put in ope-
</p>
<p>ration."  Neque illi res, &c. " Neither any result, nor any plan
</p>
<p>of operations, nor any individual fully pleased him." Res is here
</p>
<p>equivalent to facta, and consilium to faciend a.
</p>
<p>6. Quocumque intendcrat. Understand animum. " ^lutherso-
</p>
<p>everhe directed his thoughts."
</p>
<p>7. Pro tempore. "As well as the occasion would admit." 
</p>
<p>Ejus militcs. These words have very much the appearance of a
</p>
<p>useless gloss, though they are given in all the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>8. Tuta sunt. For tuita sunt, from tueor. The primitive form
</p>
<p>was tuor, tuitus sum, tui. Compare Catullus, 20, 5. Stat. Achtil.

<p>old editions, forent, instead of fuerint, which latter is given by

<p>3. Eamodo. "It alone."  Officio, intender ant. " Had overdone

<p>be translated generally, " calculated for defence, for offence." 
</p>
<p>Ceteris impentantem. " Giving laws to the rest of men." Imperito
</p>
<p>denotes the frequent exercise of unlimited authority, and is well

<p>calculated to express the superiority of nature over the efforts of

<p>man.  Lidustna. " By persevering efforts."

<p>opportunity."
</p>
<p>8. Praelio inter. tos. " Determined to defend themselves."
</p>
<p>Equivalent to "ad strenue pugnandum paratos."
</p>
<p>9. Ex copta. " Out of the whole number," which the situation
</p>
<p>of the place afforded. Sallust does not mean, out of a large num-
</p>
<p>ber, but out of as many as the place presented for selection.

</p>
<p>lay across two posts, and, hanging thus equally balanced, it was by
</p>
<p>a hundred men, more or less, (who were frequently changed,)
</p>
<p>violently thrust forward, drawn back, again pushed forward, till by
</p>
<p>repeated strokes it had shaken and broken down the wall with its
</p>
<p>iron head. The ram was covered with sheds or mantlets, called
</p>
<p>vineae, which have already been described.
</p>
<p>2. Adflictas. " Completely ruined." Literally, " dashed to the
</p>
<p>ground."  Prima. " Most valuable." Compare Catiline, chapter
</p>
<p>36.  Eas ipsi xolentes pependere. "This (punishment) they suf-
</p>
<p>fered voluntarily from their own hands." Literally, " these (atone-
</p>
<p>ments) they of themselves voluntarily paid." They had nothing to
</p>
<p>expect from the Roman commander, in case they fell into his hands,
</p>
<p>but the cruelest punishment.
</p>
<p>3. Pariter cum capta Thala. The same as Eodem tempore quo
</p>
<p>Thala capta fuit.  Pracfcctumque. "And governor."  Ni id
</p>
<p>fcstinaret. " That unless he should hasten to do this," i. e. to
</p>
<p>afford them aid.
</p>
<p>4. Suam salutcm, &c. Ulorum in this passage refers to the
</p>
<p>Romans, and it is the same as if Sallust had said, suam, qui
</p>
<p>Ulorum socii essent, salutcm. The passage may hence be para-
</p>
<p>phrased as follows : " they, the allies of the Romans, would be
</p>
<p>involved in the greatest danger." Or, wc may render more literally,
</p>
<p>though less in accordance with the English idiom, " their safety,
</p>
<p>who were the allies of the Romans, would be in the greatest danger."
</p>
<p>5. Navi feceraiit. " They had executed with promptness." The
</p>
<p>more usual form, and, we may add, the earlier one, would seem to
</p>
<p>have been gnavus, not navus. The term appears to be derived
</p>
<p>from, or analogous to, the Greek ycwalos, by contraction yvaios, and
</p>
<p>with the insertion of the digamma, dropping at the same time the i,
</p>
<p>we have yvaFo?, in Latin gnavus.

<p>6. Sit um inter duos Syrtis. Of course, Lcptis Magna is meant.

</p>
<p>5. Bocchi. Many of the old editions read Boccho, in the dative,
</p>
<p>making Bocchus to have been Jugurtha's son-in-law. The Abbe
</p>
<p>Brotier, relying upon this reading and some of Sylla's medals, pro-
</p>
<p>poses to substitute, in Plutarch's life of Marius, where mention is
</p>
<p>made of the Moorish king, the term son-in-law (yahoos), for father-
</p>
<p>in-law (7rcvQep6s). But M. Vauvilliers more judiciously contends,
</p>
<p>from six manuscripts of Sallust, and in conformity with Florus (3,
</p>
<p>1) for the term father-in-law. In this Larcher concurs. Cortius,

<p>JJ ner, he induced persons who had served out their time to go along
</p>
<p>with him." Veterans, who were exempt from any farther military
</p>
<p>duty, were sometimes induced to serve again by special request
</p>
<p>from a commander. If they did so, they were freed from all the
</p>
<p>drudgery of the camp, such as going for water, wood, forage, stand-
</p>
<p>ing guard, &c. and were generally marshalled by themselves under
</p>
<p>a standard of their own. The military age with the Romans began
</p>
<p>at seventeen, and ended generally with the forty-fifth year, after
</p>
<p>which period they were exempt, and only served if they pleased, as
</p>
<p>has just been stated. They were then called emeriti stipendus,
</p>
<p>and, from their being invited to serve a second time, exocati.
</p>
<p>3. Ceterum etiam. "Nay they even."  Quia neque plcbi, &c.
</p>
<p>We have here an imitation of the Greek construction alluded to in
</p>
<p>note 5, page 48. a Because military service was thought to be dis-
</p>
<p>agreeable to the common people, and Marius to be likely to lose the
</p>
<p>new levies that were needed for the war, or else the affections of
</p>
<p>the multitude." Compare the following examples of the Greek
</p>
<p>idiom :  Ovk av tfioiyc fknp&m* ra yivoiro. u I had not expected
</p>

<p>also in Tacitus, (Agric. 18.) " Quibus bellum volentibus erat, and

<p>in chapter 100 of the present narrative.

<p>5. Exagitandi. " Of inveighing against."  Concwnem. The

<p>primitive meaning of concio is, as in the present instance, an assem-

<p>10. Opinione, Quirites, asperius est. " Is more difficult, Ro-
</p>
<p>mans, than is generally supposed."
</p>
<p>11. Ad hoc. From this to the end of the sentence, nam alia
</p>
<p>infirma sunt, Marius seeks to show, how absolutely necessary it is
</p>
<p>for him to be possessed of integrity and principle, since he wants
</p>
<p>all those adventitious aids on which the nobility rely for impunity
</p>
<p>in their guilty career.  Nam alia infirma sunt. " For my other
</p>
<p>supports are weak."
</p>
<p>12. Et Mud intellego. A new argument is here advanced, to
</p>
<p>show why he must labour strenuously and faithfully in his new
</p>
<p>office. In order, namely, that he may fulfil the hopes of the good,
</p>
<p>and disappoint the expectations of the bad.
</p>
<p>13. Acquos bonosque. " That the just and the upright." These
</p>
<p>are flattering epithets purposely applied to the commons.  Quippe
</p>
<p>bene/acta, &c. " Since the correct discharge of duty, on my part,
</p>
<p>proves of service to my country."
</p>
<p>14. Invadcndi. " Of attack." Some understand me, it is better,
</p>
<p>however, to take the verb here absolutely, without any special
</p>
<p>reference to a case. The nobility may be considered, according to
</p>
<p>the idea of Marius, as watching for an opportunity of attacking both
</p>
<p>the commons and himself.
</p>
<p>15. Ut neque vos capiamini, &c. "That you may not be
</p>
<p>ensnared, and that they may be disappointed." A thing est frustra,
</p>
<p>when it is attended with no advantage ; a person est frustra when
</p>
<p>disappointed in his hopes.

</p>

<p>agere.

<p>of ancestors, and a total stranger at the same time to all military

</p>
<p>ship, though posterior, in point of time, to the being elected consul,
</p>
<p>is in reality prior to it, as regards the truth itself and the advantages

<p>resulting to the state." The idea intended to be conveyed is this :
</p>
<p>In strictness of language, no one can be said to hold a station, the
</p>
<p>consulship, for example, until he is appointed to it by the suffrages
</p>
<p>of the people. Ami \et, if we take into consideration the faithfui
</p>
<p>discharge of official duties, and the advantages thence resulting to
</p>
<p>the state, we must admit that qualifications and experience are prior
</p>
<p>in the scale of importance to the mere formal appointment to office.
</p>
<p>In a word, they alone are true consuls, who are qualified to dis-
</p>
<p>charge correctly the duties of the consulship, when they pi\
</p>
<p>themselx the people as candidates for that high station;

<p>second triumph, at the dedication of a temple, he exhibited shows
</p>
<p>to the people in the Grecian manner, he barely entered the theatre

<p>and sat down, and then immediately departed." Plutarch justly

<p>the excesses which stained the character of Marius.

<p>5*7 15. Praesidia agitare. "To guard." Compare the remark of
</p>
<p>Cortius : " Praesidium agitare nihil aliud est quam pratsidio esse,
</p>
<p>vel frumentantibus, vel impedimentis, vel urbi oppugnatae."
</p>
<p>gg 1. Neque illos arte colam, &c. "Nor will I treat them with
</p>
<p>severity of discipline, myself with indulgence."
</p>
<p>2. Hoc est utile, &c. " This is an exercise of authority produc-
</p>
<p>tive of benefit to the state ; this, such as one citizen should put in
</p>
<p>practice towards another." In explanation of the peculiar meaning
</p>
<p>of civile in this passage, compare Livy 6. 40 :  " Scrmo est minime
</p>
<p>civilis ;" and Crevier's note :  " Sermo est qui minime deccat ares,
</p>
<p>memores se cum civibus agere, qui pari jure libertaiis fruuntur, in
</p>
<p>quos minime liceat imperioso genere scrmonis uti."
</p>
<p>3. Tutc. The pronoun. " When you yourself live in luxurious
</p>
<p>indulgence, to compel your army to the performance of their duty
</p>
<p>by severity of punishment, this is to be a tyrant, not a commander "
</p>
<p>AVith esse understand te, so that dominut.i and impcratorcm may be
</p>
<p>accusatives after the verb.
</p>
<p>4. Quia pa rum. snte, &c. " Because I furnish out an entertain-
</p>
<p>ment with little elegance, and keep no buffoon nor cook of higher
</p>
<p>price than my steward : charges which I am perfectly willing to ad-
</p>
<p>mit." The term histrw, which here denotes a buffoon ker:t for the
</p>
<p>amusement of the company, is a general appellation, among other
</p>
<p>Roman writers, for an actor. Livy makes the word of Etrurian
</p>
<p>origin :  M Quia hister Tusco verbo ludw tocubatur, nomen histrioni-
</p>
<p>bus inditum." {Lit. 7. 2.) Festus is undoubtedly wrong in sup-
</p>
<p>posing that they were so called because I originally from
</p>
<p>Histria :  " Histrwnes died quod j>nmum ex IfiflrNl venerint." In

<p>relation to the inroads of luxury among the Romans, compare 1

<p>?. Sudorem, pulverem, &c. Every thing here is calculated to gg
</p>
<p>excite the bitterest feelings against a corrupt nobility.
</p>
<p>8. Cladi sunt. "They bring ruin upon."  Mores met. "A
</p>
<p>regard for my own character."  Illorum flagitia. An enumeration
</p>
<p>of their disgraceful excesses would require a much longer discourse.
</p>
<p>9. Avarttiam, imperitiam, superbiam. By these three words
</p>
<p>three commanders are designated. Avaritia refers to Bestia, impe-
</p>
<p>riha to Albinus, and supcrbia to Metellus.
</p>
<p>1 . Militaris aetas. The military age, as has already been re- KCk
</p>
<p>marked, commenced at 17 and ended generally at 46.
</p>
<p>2. Mequc vosque, &c. Marius means that he will, in every in-
</p>
<p>stance, desire his troops to act no otherwise than as they see him act.
</p>
<p>3. Omnia matura sunt. " All things are ripe for the harvest." 
</p>
<p>Quae si dubia y &c. An argument a fortiori. Even if victory,
</p>
<p>spoil, glory, were not within our grasp, still it would become all good
</p>
<p>men to take np arms and aid their country. How much more so
</p>
<p>then when victory is ripe for the harvest \  Dccebat. For decereU
</p>
<p>The indicative is employed to give an air of greater certainty to the
</p>
<p>clause.

</p>
<p>5. Ex classibus. By the institution of Servius Tullius, the Ro-
</p>
<p>man people were divided into six classes, according to the valuation
</p>
<p>of their property. The richest were placed in the first class, from
</p>
<p>which there was a regular progression, as respected wealth and dig-
</p>
<p>nity, down to the lowest or sixth class. The members of this class
</p>
<p>formed the great bulk of poorer citizens, and were denominated
</p>
<p>capite censi, from having no fortune, but being " rated by the
</p>
<p>head." At first, none of the lowest class were enlisted as soldiers,
</p>
<p>except in dangerous emergencies. The alteration introduced by
</p>
<p>Marius may be regarded as one of the chief causes of the ruin of

<p>6. Capite censos plerosquc. " Principally from the poorest citi-
</p>
<p>zens." Compare preceding note.  Bonorum. " Of the better
</p>
<p>class." Boni is here equivalent to ditiores.
</p>
<p>7. Quod ab eogenerc, &c. " Because he had been extolled, and
</p>
<p>advanced to office, by that class of persons," i. e. he owed to them,
</p>
<p>first his reputation, and then his advancement.
</p>
<p>8. Cum pretio. " If attended with profit to themselves."
</p>
<p>9. Expletis. " Being filled up."  Agrum. " A tract of country."
</p>
<p> Cetcrum levia, &c. We have adopted the reading suggested by

</p>
<p>QQ 1. Divorsi. " Separating/' Effusos. " When scattered about
</p>
<p>the country." Equivalent to palantes.
</p>
<p>2. Laetissumis anvnis excipitur. " Is received with the most
</p>
<p>joyful feelings." Consult Historical Index, for an account of the
</p>
<p>subsequent career of this nobleman.
</p>
<p>3. Nihil apud se remissum, &c. " He allowed no remissness in
</p>
<p>his own army nor security in those of the kings." Literally, " no
</p>
<p>remissness with himself, nor security with them.  Ex sociis
</p>
<p>nostris. Referring to the cities and communities of Numidia
</p>
<p>which had surrendered to the Roman arms, and were now regarded
</p>
<p>as a kind of allies.
</p>
<p>4. Armis cxucrat. " Had stripped of his arms," l. e. had com-
</p>
<p>pelled to fly with the loss of his arms.
</p>
<p>5. Belli pat randi. " Calculated to bring the war to a close."
</p>
<p>Scheller and other grammarians would here understand negotia esse,
</p>
<p>making nrgotui govern the genitive belli patrandi expressed. The
</p>
<p>simpler way, however, would be merely to understand esse, in the
</p>
<p>sense of belonging to, appertaining to, &c. and let the genitive belli
</p>
<p>depend upon this verb.
</p>
<p>6. Pro hostibus, &c. " Favourable to the enemy, and most dis-
</p>
<p>advantageous to himself."  Praesidns 7iudatum. '"Would be
</p>
<p>stripped of his strongholds." With nudatum supply in.
</p>
<p>7. Quo impror u That he might, on a sudden, fall
</p>
<p>more heavily upon the Romans." Some read accederet, which is
</p>
<p>far less expressive.  Mubditate ingcmi. u From the fickleness of
</p>
<p>his disposition."
</p>
<p>8. Medioeria. " Operations of no great importance."  Majora
</p>
<p>et magis aspera adgredi. kt To enter upon greater and more diffi-
</p>
<p>cult undertakings " Cortius omits inagis before aspera, and insists
</p>
<p>that the word majora involves also the comparative of the adjective
</p>
<p>which follows.

<p>six different individuals who bore the name of Hercules. He is
</p>
<p>silent, however, respecting a Libyan Hercules, unless the one whom
</p>
<p>he mentions second in order, as born of the Nile, and surnamed
</p>
<p>Aegyptius, be the same. In truth, however, the history of Hercules
</p>
<p>is a mere fable. Hercules is the sun, and his twelve labours have
</p>
<p>a direct reference to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Creuzer has
</p>
<p>discovered some very striking points of resemblance between Her-
</p>
<p>ules, Djemschid, Mithras, and Osiris.
</p>
<p>10. Immunes. " Free from all taxes."  Leri imperio. " Under
</p>
<p>a mild government." This circumstance, and the immunity from
</p>
<p>all tribute would seem to indicate a city of sacerdotal origin.

</p>
<p>1. Infesta serpentibus. Silius Italic us makes mention also of g|
</p>
<p>the African serpents, (1. 211,) and, in his sixth book (v. 146, seqq.)
</p>
<p>describes the contest between the army of Regulus and a monstrous
</p>
<p>serpent, near the river Bagradas.
</p>
<p>2. Quarum vis. " Whose fury."  Ipsa perniciosa. " Deadly
</p>
<p>in itself."  Siti magis, &c. Compare Virgil, Georg. 3, 432.
</p>
<p>3. Usum belli. " Its importance to the war."  Res. " The
</p>
<p>enterprise."  Oppidum Thalam. Compare chapters 75 and 76.
</p>
<p>4. Jugi aqua. " Affording an unfailing supply of water."  Ce-
</p>
<p>tera, &c. Understand aqua. " What they used besides was rahv
</p>
<p>water."
</p>
<p>5. In omni Africa, quae agebat. For in omnibus Afri-
</p>
<p>cams qui agebant (scil. vitam). Cortius reads qui and age-
</p>
<p>bant, which if extremely harsh after Africa.
</p>
<p>6. Salem. Sal is found in the singular as a neuter also. The
</p>
<p>plural sales is masculine, and signifies witticisms.
</p>
<p>7. Illis erat. u Was employed by them." Literally, " food was
</p>
<p>to them."
</p>
<p>8. Tentabatur. " He was threatened."  Arvo. " Tillage." 
</p>
<p>Quodcumqiic iiatum fuerat. M Whatever had been produced from
</p>
<p>the fields," i. e. all the grain.
</p>
<p>9. Pro rei copia. " Considering all circumstances."  Agendum.
</p>
<p>" To be driven on."
</p>
<p>10. Se praedabundum, &c. "He adds, that, after pillaging the
</p>
<p>country, he will come thither at the end of a few days." Literally,
</p>
<p>u that he, pillaging the country, (i. e. at present,) will come there
</p>
<p>after a few days." Understand dicit. The form in bundus has the
</p>
<p>general force of a present participle, with the meaning somewhat
</p>
<p>strengthened. Pracdabundus here denotes an active system of
</p>
<p>pillage.
</p>
<p>11. Centurias. Referring to the infantry, turmas to the cavalry.
</p>
<p>~Aequaliter. " In equal proportion," i. e. according to their

<p>respective numbers.
</p>
<p>1. Proxuma. Understand node.  Tumulosum. " Covered with gg
</p>
<p>hills." These hills would conceal his forces from the view of the

<p>people of Capsa, until the cavalry and light-armed troops could
</p>
<p>strike the first blow.
</p>
<p>2. Res trepidae. " The consternation into which they were
</p>
<p>thrown."
</p>
<p>3. Id f acinus. " This act of severity." Sallust, in what follows,
</p>
<p>makes a poor excuse for the conduct of the Roman commander. 
</p>
<p>Coercitum. " Capable of being kept in subjection." Coercitum, if
</p>
<p>the reading be correct, has here the force of coercendum. Compare

</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>ft*2 tne remarks of Cortius, (ad loc.) and Perizom'us, (ad Sanctii Mm.
</p>
<p>1, 15). Still, however, the whole clause is very suspicious. If
</p>
<p>coercitum be taken as the simple participle of the passive voice,
</p>
<p>with the preteritive meaning (" kept in subjection,") it may well be
</p>
<p>asked, when had the inhabitants of the place proved faithless to the
</p>
<p>Romans 1 If, on the other hand, coercitum be taken for cotrcendum,
</p>
<p>the Capsensians are punished on anticipation merely ! For the
</p>
<p>Romans as yet know nothing about them. The only way to obviate
</p>
<p>the difficulty, is by supposing that the allusion in genus kominum,
</p>
<p>&c, is to the race of Numidians generally.
</p>
<p>4. Omnia, non bene, &c. We have adopted the reading of the
</p>
<p>Bipont edition, which has the authority of some manuscripts in its
</p>
<p>favour. Cortius and many subsequent editors read, Omnia non bene
</p>
<p>consvlta in virtutcm trahebantur. Our lection, however, appears
</p>
<p>decidedly preferable, if we only take virtutcm in its more extended
</p>
<p>sense, " military talents."
</p>
<p>5. Modesto impeno. " Under a gentle command."  Deorum
</p>
<p>nutu. " By the will of the gods," i e. their special interposi-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>6. Deserta. " Abandoned by their inhabitant-

<p>The common texts omit ad. Render, " He advances to another

</p>
<p>ous features as that against the Capsensiai
</p>
<p>9. Inter ccteram planitiem. "In the midst of a plain." There
</p>
<p>was only a single mountain, the rest was one entire plain.  Satts

</p>
<p>3. Pro opere. M In front of the works." Either to defend them
</p>
<p>against the sallies of the enemy, or to attempt the walls by scaling.
</p>
<p>By the works are here meant the nneae.  Iniquitatem loci. Re-
</p>
<p>ferring to the steepness and narrowness of the path.  Intra rinea*.
</p>
<p>We have here adopted the emendation of Glareanus, trt/ra, in the
</p>
<p>place of inter. The sense requires intra rineas, u under the shelter
</p>
<p>of the rineae.
</p>
<p>4. Administrare. ''To labour."  Optumus quisque. ''The
</p>
<p>bravest."

</p>
<p>" The interposition of fortune."
</p>
<p>6. Aestuans. " In the greatest perplexity." Literally, " boil-
</p>
<p>ing '' with vexation.  Quidam Ligus. The Ligurians were accus-
</p>
<p>tomed to a mountaineer-life, (Flor. 2, 3,) which makes the narra-
</p>
<p>tive of the historian the more probable.
</p>
<p>7. Avorsumpraeliantibus. " On the side opposite to that where
</p>
<p>the two parties were contending."  Cochlcas. Snails were held in
</p>
<p>high repute, as an article of food, among the ancients. Those of
</p>
<p>Africa were particularly prized. (Plin. H. N. 9. 56.)
</p>
<p>8. Solitudinem intcllexit. " He perceived that he was com-
</p>
<p>pletely alone." He saw no traces of any human being.  Ignara.
</p>
<p>In the sense of ignota. Compare Aulus Gellius, 9, 12.
</p>
<p>9. Paullulum modo prona, &c. " Bending a little downward at
</p>
<p>first, then taking a turn and growing upward, a direction to which
</p>
<p>their nature causes all vegetable productions to tend." Cuncta
</p>
<p>gigncntium put for quaecumque terra gignuvtur.
</p>
<p>10. Castelli planitiem perscribit. " Reconnoitres the platform
</p>
<p>of the fortress." With perscribit understand animo.
</p>
<p>11. Eadem. Supply via.  Tcmcre. " Heedlessly," or "care-
</p>
<p>lessly."
</p>
<p>12. Ex praesentibus . Understand quosdam.  Paullum arrcctus.
</p>
<p>" Somewhat aroused." The distinction between paullum and parum
</p>
<p>should be noted by the student. Paullum means " a little," parum
</p>
<p>'little." Thus paullum pecuniae, "a little money," "some
</p>
<p>money ;" but parum pecuniae, " little money," hardly any.
</p>
<p>1. Tubicinum et cor?iicinum. " Of trumpeters and cornet- r**
</p>
<p>blowers."
</p>
<p>2. Ex praecepto. " According to the instructions of Marius." 
</p>
<p>Pcrgit. Understand Ligus.  Mi quae ccnturiis praerant. A cir-
</p>
<p>cumlocution merely for centuricmes. Cortius, however, suspects
</p>
<p>that there is something wnrong in the text.  Duce. " Their guide,"

<p>3. Prospectus nisusque per saxa. " The view before them, and
</p>
<p>their clambering over the rocks."  Pondcris gratia. "For the
</p>
<p>sake of lightness." Literally, " on account of their weight," which
</p>
<p>was much less than that of the ordinary shield.  Et offensa quo
</p>
<p>lexius strcperent. " And that, when struck against any thing, they
</p>
<p>might make the less noise." Might less loudly resound.
</p>
<p>4. Vetustate. " Through age."  Laqueis vinciebat. " Bound
</p>
<p>with cords," i. e. fixed cords about.  Quibus adlevati. "Be-

<p>10. Norique, ct ob ea, &c. M And the new levies along with

<p>them, rendered even in this way more familiar with warfare." If
</p>
<p>the text be correct, Sallust means to convey the idea, that the new
</p>
<p>levies, being accustomed to be united with the veterans, (chap. 87,)
</p>
<p>had learned the art of war by practice and example, and displayed their
</p>
<p>military experience to ally on the present occasion, being
</p>
<p>encouraged by the presence and support of the older troops. Hence,
</p>
<p>ob ca will refer to their having been in the habit of being united
</p>
<p>with the veterans on previous occasions, and their being again so
</p>
<p>united in the present instance. It is extremely doubtful, however,
</p>
<p>whether Sallust wrote what we have given in the text, and what all
</p>
<p>the editions follow. Cortius retains the common reading, but sug-
</p>

</p>
<p>the words of Salmasius, (de Re Mil. Ram. c. 10, p. 103, edit.
</p>
<p>Lvdg. 1657,) " Quadratum agmen nan dicitur, cujus latitudo

</p>
<p>here equivalent to scd tamen, and the meaning intended to be con-
</p>
<p>veyed, is : " But, whether he acted from ambitious motives, or from

<p>is in favour of the opposite opinion.

<p>4. Satis impigre. " With great quickness," i. e. with so much

<p>Some, however, render it " with great bravery." This is certainly
</p>
<p>inferior.
</p>
<p>5. Atrocitate rei. " With the dreadful nature of the thing."
</p>
<p>The meaning intended to be conveyed is this : The Romans were
</p>
<p>thrown into alarm, not so much from any confidence which they
</p>
<p>placed in the words of Jugurtha, as from the reflection, that there
</p>
<p>was indeed a possibility of their favourite commander's losing his
</p>
<p>life in the action.

<p>6. Adeptam. Used passively, adipiscor being a common, not a

<p>deponent, verb.  Yitabundus. "After making the most vigorous

<p>adopt the form used in the text, or quinto die postquam pufrnaverant,

<p>206 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>*VO here in efficiebant, that is, the verb has two meanings, to suit
</p>
<p>Our idiom, one for each clause. " Caused the number to appear
</p>
<p>greater than the reality to Sylla and the rest of his party, and gave
</p>
<p>rise to apprehensions as of the approach of an enemy."
</p>
<p>7. Expedire. " Got ready for battle." We may understand ad
</p>
<p>pugnam, which is expressed in Livy, (38, 21,) " Quos ubi Romani
</p>
<p>viderunt, expediunt sese ad pugnam. 11
</p>
<p>8. Tentare. " They tried."  Intendere. This is commonly
</p>
<p>rendered, " they bent their bows," with an ellipsis of arcus. Such
</p>
<p>an interpretation, however, is decidedly pleonastic, since arma atque
</p>
<p>tela tentare precedes. The true meaning is, " directed his whole
</p>
<p>attention to the approaching engagement." Understand animum.
</p>
<p>9. Rem, uti erat, &c. " Bring back word, as was actually the
</p>
<p>case, that all was peaceful," i. e. that there was nothing to fear.
</p>
<p>10. Obviam Mis simul, et praesidio. " Both to receive them,
</p>
<p>and to act as an escort." Literally, " both to meet them, and for a
</p>
<p>guard."
</p>
<p>11. Incerto voltu. " With a troubled look."
</p>
<p>12. Animo feroci. " With stern resolution."  Cert a pestis.
</p>
<p>" Certain destruction."  Ab eodem. Referring to Volux.
</p>
<p>13. Coenatos esse. " To have their evening repast over." Some
</p>
<p>neuter verbs have participles which are passive in form, but active
</p>
<p>in meaning; as cocnatus, " one who has supped ;" pransus, "one
</p>
<p>who has dined ;" juratus, " one who has sworn," &c. The Roman
</p>
<p>soldiers took food twice a day, at dinner and at supper. The former
</p>
<p>was a slight meal, which they commonly took standing. They
</p>
<p>indulged themselves a little more at supper.
</p>
<p>14. Prima vigilia. The Romans, as has been observed in a
</p>
<p>previous note, divided the night into four watches of three hours
</p>
<p>each. The first watch commenced at sunset.
</p>
<p>Y3 * Ante. " In advance of them."
</p>
<p>2. Manu vindicandum. " That immediate vengeance ought to

</p>
<p>be taken." That he ought to be punished in a summary manner.
</p>
<p>3. Prohibet. " Protects."  Advorsum multitudinem. "Against
</p>
<p>a host."  Quantosibi, &c. Compare Catiline, (chap. 58,) M Semper
</p>
<p>in praelio" &c.
</p>
<p>4. Nudum et caecum corpus. " That part of the body which has
</p>
<p>no shield to protect it. and no eyes by which danger may be
</p>
<p>avoided ;" i. e. a defenceless and blind back. Compare Xenophon,
</p>
<p>(Cyrop. 3, 3,) Mwpdr yap to, KparcTv 0ov\o[iivovs, rat rv<p\a rov eioftarxs,
</p>
<p>K<xl ao7rXa, /cal a^eipa, ravra ivavria rarrtiv roi$ iroXefiioig <ptvyovrai.
</p>
<p>5. Quoniam hostilia faceret. " Since he was acting the part of an
</p>
<p>enemy."
</p>
<p>JUGURTHINE WAR. 207
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>6. Ceterum, &c. il Besides, since he (Jugurtha) had not a large ^3
</p>
<p>force with him, and his hopes and resources depended upon his
</p>
<p>(Volux's) father, that he (Jugurtha) would not dare to do any thing
</p>
<p>openly, while he himself, (Volux,) the son, was present as a witness
</p>
<p>of his conduct."
</p>
<p>7. Per media ejus castra. Cortius thinks the meaning would be
</p>
<p>improved if media were omitted, and prae rendered by praeter. We
</p>
<p>cannot agree with him. Volux had stated, that Jugurtha would not
</p>
<p>dare to do any thing openly if he were present : in confirmation of
</p>
<p>this, he proposes that they march boldly through his very encamp-
</p>
<p>ment. Jugurtha probably had encamped his forces in two divisions,
</p>
<p>or else in scattered order.
</p>
<p>8. Acciderant. Some editions have accesserant. Cortius, how-
</p>
<p>ever, successfully defends the lection we have given in the text, and
</p>
<p>makes it signify " they had come ;" for accido frequently has this
</p>
<p>meaning when any person or thing chances to arrive unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>Compare Livy, (32, 30,) " Civitati fama inccrta accidit ;" and
</p>
<p>Quintus Curtius, (4, 4, 6,) " Alexander classem litori, e quo fremitus
</p>
<p>acciderat, admovit." So also Tacitus, (Hist. 4, 29, 4,) Unde
</p>
<p>clamor acciderat ;" and our own author, chapter 88 of this narrative,
</p>
<p>"quo improvisus gravior accideret."
</p>
<p>9. Orator. M As his ambassador," or " agent." Compare
</p>
<p>Livy, (30, 16,) "Jam nullo auctore belli ultra audito, oratores ad
</p>
<p>pacem petendam mittunt.'' 1 Observe also the change of construc-
</p>
<p>tion in our author, "praemissus orator, et (praemissus) specu-
</p>
<p>latum."
</p>
<p>10. Quern Bocchus, &c. Cortius inserts Romanis after fidum ;
</p>
<p>but Bocchus had not been long acquainted with the Romans, and,
</p>
<p>therefore, fidum Romanis seems too harsh. Fidum here means
</p>
<p>simply, "worthy of reliance."
</p>
<p>11. Consulta sese omnia, &c. "That he was keeping every
</p>
<p>subject of consultation undetermined, until he could consider it

</p>
<p>in conjunction with him," i. e. that he had reserved every thing for
</p>
<p>their common consideration.
</p>
<p>1. Neu Jugurthae legatum pertimesceret, &c. " The true read- 74
</p>
<p>ing here is extremely doubtful. Some have accitum esse quo res t
</p>
<p>&c. Others cautum esse. Cortius places a semicolon after perti-
</p>
<p>mesceret, and makes quo res communis, &c, follow immediately
</p>
<p>after, without either accitum esse or cautum esse. As accitum esse
</p>
<p>is wanting in most of the manuscripts, we have adopted the conjec-
</p>
<p>ture of Gronovius, by which quo is changed into quin, and the
</p>
<p>meaning of the passage then becomes, " Nor should he be disquieted
</p>
<p>at the presence of Jugurtha's ambassador, lest, in consequence of
</p>
<p>208 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>74 this, their common business might be carried on with less freedom
</p>
<p>than otherwise."
</p>
<p>2. Nam ab insidiis ejus, &c. Bocchus means, that he has been
</p>
<p>compelled to allow Jugurtha to have an ambassador at his court,
</p>
<p>since otherwise that monarch would have been constantly annoying
</p>
<p>him by his intrigues ; whereas the presence of his ambassador
</p>
<p>would lead Jugurtha to think, that no scheme could be formed by
</p>
<p>Bocchus, unfriendly to his (Jugurtha's) interests, without that am-
</p>
<p>bassador's perceiving it, and hence the suspicions of the Numidian
</p>
<p>monarch would not be so constantly excited.
</p>
<p>3. Tunica fide. "With a treacherous intent." The Roman
</p>
<p>writers used the expression Punica fides to denote bad faith, in
</p>
<p>allusion to the frequent violation of compacts which were, charged
</p>
<p>against the Carthaginians by their haughty rivals. The Carthaginians
</p>
<p>might have returned the compliment without any great violation of
</p>
<p>the truth. Attica fides was a proverbial expression, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, to indicate good faith. Compare Velleius Paterculus,
</p>
<p>(2, 23, 4,) " Adco enim certa Athcmensium in Romanos fides fuit,
</p>
<p>ut semper, et in omni re, quidquid sinccrafide gereretur, id Ramani
</p>
<p>Attica fieri pracdicarent." Some writers extend this character for
</p>
<p>good faith to the whole nation, and make Graeca fides and Attica
</p>
<p>fides synonymous. This is altogether incorrect. The true expla-
</p>
<p>nation is given by Junius, (Adagia Yctcrum, p. 577,) " Graeca
</p>
<p>fides pro dubia et tana accipitur, hand pro certa : quippe quae nulla
</p>
<p>prorsus esset, nisi praesente pecunia oculitus creditori satisdaretur.
</p>
<p>Quod ex Plauto, in Asinaria, manifcs turn fit, iibi ait: Cetera

<p>5. Lubidnnem. "Inclination."
</p>
<p>6. Quae rcsponderentur. " What answer should be given,"
</p>
<p>i. e. what answer Bocchus must give him in the presence of Ju-
</p>
<p>gurtha's envoy.
</p>
<p>7. In sua castra. The reference here is to Sylla and Bocchus,
</p>
<p>not to Sylla and Aspar as Cortius maintains. " Sulla,''' observes
</p>
<p>Burnouf, " quamvis paucos milites habcret, eos videlicet alicubi
</p>
<p>habere neccsse fuit. Ubi autcm si ?ion in castris ? Et Bocchus,
</p>
<p>quum helium gereret, cur non et ipse castra in proprio regno ha-.
</p>
<p>buisset ?" In addition to this it may be observed, that Aspar on
</p>
<p>the very next day was still at the court of Bocchus, which could not

</p>
<p>possibly have been the case if he had set out the day previous for *?A
</p>
<p>the camp of Jugurtha, since it took many days subsequently for him
</p>
<p>to go and come: " proper ato itinere, post diem octavum redit ad
</p>
<p>Bocchum," (ch. 112.)
</p>
<p>8. Internuncius. "As a mutual adviser."  Sanctus vir, &c.
</p>
<p>"A man of strict integrity, and acceptable to both parties." The
</p>
<p>common text has ex sententia jurat ambobus. " And who swears as
</p>
<p>was agreed upon by both parties, to make faithful representations to
</p>
<p>each." This, however, is deservedly rejected by Cortius and others.
</p>
<p>9. Fuerit mihi pretium, &c. " Let it have been my good lot to
</p>
<p>have stood in need, at length, of your friendship." Fuerit mihi
</p>
<p>pretium is here equivalent to, res in bonis numeranda fuerit mihi.
</p>
<p>10. Id adeo, &c. " Of the truth of this indeed you may make
</p>
<p>full trial."
</p>
<p>11. Integra. "In full force," i. e. undiminished in value.  -
</p>
<p>Me sciente. " Provided I be made acquainted with the object of
</p>
<p>your wishes."
</p>
<p>12. Cujus curator. " As the agent of which," i. e. for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of attending to the interests of which.
</p>
<p>13. Tutus sum. For tuitus sum. Consult note 8, page 49.
</p>
<p>1. Egrediar. In the sense of transgrediar. Some verbs, com- 7 5
</p>
<p>pounded of prepositions that govern an ablative, take an accusative.
</p>
<p>Thus, besides the example in the text, we have in Livy, egredi urbem,
</p>
<p>and, in other writers, excedere urbem, &c. (Zumpt. L. G. p. 256.)
</p>
<p>2. Quod polliceatur. " With regard to the offer just made."
</p>
<p>Sulla here refers to the offer of Bocchus, stated in the preceding
</p>
<p>chapter, " Arma,viros, .... sume } utere ; and again, " Egoflumen
</p>
<p>Mulucham non egrediar, neque" &c.
</p>
<p>3. Id adeo, &c. " That this, indeed, was an easy matter, since
</p>
<p>he had Jugurtha in his power."
</p>
<p>4. Negitare. " Gave a decided negative."
</p>
<p>5. Fluxafide usus. " If he acted with bad faith towards Jugur-

<p>tha."  Avorteret. " He might alienate."
</p>
<p>6. Lenitur. "He is softened down." Some editions have
</p>
<p>leniter, the adverbial form, " with a softened air."
</p>
<p>7. Ad simulandam pacem. " For keeping up the appearance of
</p>
<p>a negotiation for peace."  Numida. Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>8. Posse poni. " Could be brought to a close."  Cuncta edoctus.
</p>
<p>9* Having received full instructions."
</p>
<p>9. Conventam. "After having been agreed upon."  Frustra
</p>
<p>fuisse. " Had proved of no effect," i. e. had never been ratified by
</p>
<p>the government at home.
</p>
<p>10. Ceterum si ambobus t &c. " That, however, if he wished to

</p>
<p>&c.
</p>
<p>11. Non sua ignavia. " Not through any ill conduct on his part."
</p>
<p> Rempublicam. " His attention to the public business."  Relictum
</p>
<p>iri. Supply ibi.
</p>
<p>12. Dolo an vere. " Treacherously or sincerely."
</p>
<p>7*6 ! Ipsae sibi advorsae. " They clash with one another." Are
</p>
<p>inconsistent with one another.
</p>
<p>2. Constitute. "We have thrown out, after this, the words in
</p>
<p>colloquium uti de pace veniretur, as a mere repetition from the pre-
</p>
<p>vious chapter, and savouring of a gloss.
</p>
<p>3. Benigne habere. " He treated them kindly."
</p>
<p> 4. Adhibitis amicis. " Having called in his friends," i. e. to
</p>
<p>aid him with their advice.  Remotis. " Having dismissed them."
</p>
<p>5. Voltu corporis, &c. " The movements of his body varying
</p>
<p>with the purposes of his souL" Voltus is here used as a general
</p>
<p>term for the gestures of the body, including also the expression oi
</p>
<p>the countenance, in short, any thing indicative of the will (vultus a
</p>
<p>volo). Compare chapter 34, tcrrebat eum clamor e, vultu, &c, where
</p>
<p>the same usage occurs.
</p>
<p>6. Patefecisse. Governed by dicitur understood. Some read
</p>
<p>quae scilicet, tacente ipso, occulta pectoris patefecisse, making this
</p>
<p>last word depend for its government on scilicet, i. e. scire licet.
</p>
<p>7. Quaestore nostro. Sylla.  Tumulum. " A rising ground."
</p>
<p> Insidiantibus. " By those lying in wait."
</p>
<p>8. Ut dictum. " As had been agreed upon."
</p>
<p>9. Ad Marium deductus. Plutarch, in his life of Sylla, states,
</p>
<p>that, although the capture of Jugurtha procured Marius a triumph,
</p>
<p>yet envy ascribed the whole glory of it to Sylla. This Marius in his
</p>
<p>heart not a little resented, adds the biographer, especially when he
</p>
<p>found that Sylla, who was naturally fond of fame, and from a low
</p>
<p>and obscure condition now rose to general esteem, suffered his am-

</p>
<p>bition to carry him so far as to order a signet to be engraved with a
</p>
<p>representation of the capture of Jugurtha. This he constantly used
</p>
<p>in sealing his letters. The device was, Bocchus delivering up
</p>
<p>Jugurtha, and Sylla receiving him.
</p>
<p>10. Gallos. More correctly Germanos, for they were the Cim-
</p>
<p>bri, Teutones, and Tigurini. Compare Florus, (3, 3,) " Cimbri,
</p>
<p>Theutoni atque Tigurini, ab extremis Galliae profugi, quum terras
</p>
<p>eorum inundasset Oceanus, novas sedes toto orbe quaerebant ; exclu-
</p>
<p>sique Gallia et Hispania, quum in Italiam remigrarent miser e lega-
</p>
<p>tor in castra Silani, inde ad Senatum," &c. ; and again, " Sed nee

<p>lius, nee tertium Caepio sustinere potuerunt. Omnes fugati, exuti *7Q
</p>
<p>castris. Actum erat, nisi Marius iUi seculo contigisset."
</p>
<p>11. Blique, &c. " Both the Romans of that day, and thence
</p>
<p>downward even to our own time."
</p>
<p>12. Cum Gallis, &c. Compare Cicero, {Off. 1, 12,) " Cum
</p>
<p>Cimbris, ut cum inimicis, gerebatur; uter esset 1 non uter imperaret ?"
</p>
<p>13. Jugurtham vinctum, &c. It may not be improper to add a
</p>
<p>few words relative to the fate of Jugortha. " It is said," observes
</p>
<p>Plutarch, " that when he was led before the car of the conqueror,
</p>
<p>he lost his senses. After the triumph, he was thrown into prison,
</p>
<p>where, while they were in haste to strip him, some tore his robe off
</p>
<p>his back, and others, catching eagerly at his pendants, pulled off
</p>
<p>the tips of his ears along with them. When he was thrust down
</p>
<p>naked into the dungeon, all confused, he said with a frantic smile,
</p>
<p>" Heavens ! how cold is this bath of yours !" There, having strug-
</p>
<p>gled, for six days, with extreme hunger, and to the last hour labour-
</p>
<p>ing for the preservation of life, he came to such an end as his crimes
</p>
<p>deserved. There were carried (we are told) in his triumph, three
</p>
<p>thousand and seven pounds of gold, five thousand, seven hundred
</p>
<p>and seventy-five of silver bullion, and of silver coin, seventeen thou-
</p>
<p>sand and twenty-eight drachmas."
</p>
<p>14. Absens. " Though absent." This was a violation of the law,
</p>
<p>since no person, strictly speaking, was allowed to stand candidate
</p>
<p>for the consulship, unless present at the time in Rome. The con-
</p>
<p>dition, however, was often violated.
</p>
<p>15. Kalendis Januariis. The first of January, the day when
</p>
<p>the new consuls were inducted into office. Consult note 12,
</p>
<p>page 98. After the solemnity of the triumph was finished, Marius,
</p>
<p>as Plutarch informs us, assembled the senate in the capitol, where,
</p>
<p>either through inadvertence, or gross insolence, he entered in his
</p>
<p>triumphal robes ; but soon perceiving that the senate was offended,
</p>
<p>he went and put on his ordinary habit, and then returned to his

<p>NOTES
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE.
</p>
<p>1. Omnis. For omnes. The old form. (Jugurtha, note 9, ^0
</p>
<p>page 1,).  Sese student praestare. The insertion of the pronoun
</p>
<p>here is not a pleonasm, as some maintain, but in reality the older
</p>
<p>and fuller form of expression, and may be regarded as equivalent to
</p>
<p>ut ipsi praestent. Instances occur in other writers also. Thus,
</p>
<p>Cicero, {Off. 2. 20.) " Gratum se videri studet." So also after
</p>
<p>cupere, velle, and malle.
</p>
<p>2. Silentio. " In obscurity." The silence which the rest of man-
</p>
<p>kind preserve respecting us, when we have done nothing to render
</p>
<p>our names illustrious.

<p>3. Prona. " Stooping downward to the earth." Compare Ovid,
</p>
<p>(Met. 1, 84,) " Pronaque quum spectent animalia caetera terrain."
</p>
<p>4. Animi impcrio, &c. " We use more the empire of the mind, the
</p>
<p>obedience of the body." Sallust wishes to convey the idea, that it
</p>
<p>is the province of the mind to command, of the body to obey. Some
</p>
<p>very erroneously make impcrio depend for its government on the
</p>
<p>comparative magis. " We make more use of the empire of the
</p>
<p>mind, than of the obedience of the body."
</p>
<p>5. Quo. " On which account."  Rectius. " More consistent
</p>
<p>with reason."  Opibus. " By the resources."
</p>
<p>6. Mcmoriam nostri. " The remembrance of ourselves." Me-
</p>
<p>moriam nostram would mean " our faculty of memory."
</p>
<p>7. Habetur. The force of this verb, in the present passage, is
</p>
<p>best seen by a paraphrase : " The endowments of mind form the
</p>
<p>only illustrious and lasting possession."
</p>
<p>8. Sed. Elegantly used in the sense of continuation, like 6c
</p>
<p>in Greek, and to be rendered " Now."  Vine corporis, &c.
</p>
<p>44 Whether a warlike enterprise depended more for its success on
</p>
<p>strength of body, or energy of mind." Literally, 44 whether a war-
</p>
<p>like operation proceeded more from strength of body," &c.

</p>
<p>execution," i. e. in proper season. The participles consulto and

<p>79 fa t0 are ^ ere c l e g ar itly used in place of nouns. The literal trans-
</p>
<p>lation would be, " of a thing's being deliberated upon," and " of its
</p>
<p>being performed in proper season."
</p>
<p>10. Imperii. " Of authority."  Diversi. "Differing in their views."
</p>
<p> Agitabatur. The frequentative for the simple verb, as in Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>11. Cyrus. The elder of the name.
</p>
<p>12. Lubidinem dominandi. u A lust of dominion."  Maxumam
</p>
<p>gloriam. Understand sitam esse, or something equivalent.
</p>
<p>13. Periculo aiquc negotiis. " From actual experience, and
</p>
<p>from affairs themselves," i. e. from the experience which affairs
</p>
<p>themselves bestowed.
</p>
<p>g0 1. Quod si regum, &c. " But if the mental qualities of kings
</p>
<p>and of those who command were exercised to the same degree in
</p>
<p>peace that they are in war."  Aequabilius atque constantius, &c.
</p>
<p>" Human affairs would proceed with more regularity and steadi-
</p>
<p>ness." This usage of the verb habeo with the pronoun is analo-
</p>
<p>gous to the Greek idiom : ev e%ti "he is well," i. e. ri ^ (iavrdv)
</p>
<p>"he has himself well." (Compare Vigcr's Greek Idioms, p. 84.
</p>
<p>Scager's transl.)
</p>
<p>2. Aliud alio, &c. Alius, as has already been remarked in the
</p>
<p>Notes to the Jugurthin* fre q uently l,src * ^y Sallust, and
</p>
<p>also by the best writers, with one of its own cases, or an adverb
</p>
<p>derived from it, to denote what in English requires two separate
</p>
<p>expressions. Thus we may render the passage in the text, u neither
</p>
<p>would you behold one thing carried in one direction, another in
</p>
<p>another, " c\c  Artibus. "Means."
</p>
<p>3. Pro labor*. M In the stead of active exertion." Labor has
</p>
<p>here a special reference to military operations.  Pro continentia ct
</p>
<p>aequitate, &c. u In the stead of moderation and a regard for natu-
</p>
<p>ral equality, cupidity, and a tyrannical spirit," &c. As Sallust here
</p>
<p>contrasts virtues and vices, continentia will be opposed to lubido,
</p>
<p>and aequitas to superlna ; which removes, we conceive, all diffi-

<p>culty as to the meaning of the individual terms. Burnouf makes
</p>
<p>lubido in this passage signify "caprice," an opinion in which we
</p>
<p>cannot concur.  Fort una. Understand principum.
</p>
<p>4. Optumu-m quemque. "The most deserving." Literally,
</p>
<p>" each most deserving person."  Arant. eVc. Equivalent to arando,
</p>
<p>narigando, aedificando ejficiunt : hence quae homi?ies arant. h
</p>
<p>may be rendered by nouns, "agriculture, navigation, architect".
</p>
<p> Virtu ti omni parent. " Depend all upon the energies of mind for
</p>
<p>their successful employment."

</p>
<p>rona, (Serm. 32,) " Scd qui sunt praetereuntes, nisi qui per egrinan-
</p>
<p>tcs corporalis vitae saeculum transeunt."
</p>
<p>6. Quibus, profecto, &c. " Unto whom, certainly in opposition
</p>
<p>to the views of nature," &c.  Juxta. " Alike," i. e. as equally
</p>
<p>unimportant.  Quoniam de utraque siletur. rt Since silence is pre-
</p>
<p>served respecting each," i. e. since they leave no memorial of their
</p>
<p>having ever existed.
</p>
<p>7. Frui anima. " To enjoy his rational nature, i. e. to answer the
</p>
<p>end of his existence.  Qui, aliquo negotio intentus, &c. 4 *Who,
</p>
<p>in whatever employment he may be engaged, seeks for the reputa-

<p>8. In magna capia rcrum. " In the great variety of employ-
</p>
<p>ments/'  Aliud alii. Compare note 2.
</p>
<p>9. Bene diccre. Equivalent to eloquentiam exercere. Eloquence
</p>
<p>was one of the surest passports to office among the Romans.  Ab-
</p>
<p>surdum. This term was originally applied to any harsh and disa-
</p>
<p>greeable sound, ("Vox quae surdis auribus audin dignaest") and
</p>
<p>subsequently to any thing devoid of merit and unworthy of notice.
</p>
<p>Haud absurdum est may therefore be rendered, " is no contemptible
</p>
<p>acquirement."
</p>
<p>10. Et qui fccerCj &c. Supply coram before qui.

<p>11. Auctorem rcrum. ''The actor." Some editions have acto-
</p>
<p>rcm rcrum : both lections occur in manuscripts. Compare Velleius
</p>
<p>Paterculus, (2, 120, 6,) " Praeclari facinoris auctor fuit Caldus
</p>
<p>Coclius" &c.  Res gestas. " An historical narrative."  Dictis.
</p>
<p>11 By the style." Livy has an expression similar to that in the text,
</p>
<p>in which, however, dicta is used in its original meaning ; "facta

<p>dictis acquando.'* (6. 20.)

</p>
<p>camp and Burnouf. The Bipont text has reliquis and qua cetc-
</p>
<p>rosy by which eadem fama and invidia become ablatives. In
</p>
<p>our lection fama and invidia are likewise ablatives, but eadem
</p>
<p>is in the nominative agreeing with cvpido. The whole passage may
</p>
<p>be rendered as follows :  " And though I was uncontaminated by the
</p>
<p>evil principles of others, nevertheless the same desire of advance-
</p>
<p>ment disquieted me, by reason of the obloquy and odium that ac-
</p>
<p>companied it, which disquieted the rest," i. e. standing forth as a
</p>
<p>candidate for public honours, I shared the fate of others : my char-
</p>
<p>acter was assailed with obloquy, and an attempt was made by
</p>
<p>political opponents to render me an object of popular odium.  De

<p>for his recent and disgraceful expulsion from the senate.

</p>
<p>tion. From this passage of Sallust, it appears that the histo:
</p>
<p>Catiline's conspiracy was his first literary production.
</p>
<p>5. Partibus reipublicac. " The factions which agitated the re-
</p>
<p>public." Dahl is of opinion, that, from the language of the text,
</p>
<p>Sallust must have composed this narrative after his return from the
</p>
<p>government of Numidia ; since, to suppose with some commenta-
</p>

<p>7. Nobih genere natus. Catiline was the last of the gens Sergia,
</p>
<p>a patrician house. Consult Historical Index.
</p>
<p>8. Sed ingenio malo pra^oque. u But of a wicked and depraved
</p>
<p>spirit." The term ingenium appears to denote quicquid est ingeni-
</p>
<p>tum, and is applied to the native qualities of the whole soul, those
</p>
<p>oi the heart, as well as those of the head. ( Crombie, Gymn. vol.
</p>
<p>2, p. 73.)
</p>
<p>9. Ibique. " And in these." Ibi is here elegantly used for in
</p>
<p>iis rebus.  Jurentutem. By the Romans, generally speaking,
</p>
<p>human life was divided into four stages of fifteen years each : thus
</p>
<p>puentia was within 15 : adolescentia within 30 ; juventus within
</p>
<p>45 ; and seneetus comprised the remaining period of life. Compare
</p>
<p>Classical Journal, vol. 1, p. 473. Crombie's Gymnasium, vol. 1,
</p>
<p>p. 160.

<p>10. Patiens. The verbal adjective, distinguished from the par-
</p>
<p>ticiple by its particular government ; thus, patiens inediac, " able to
</p>
<p>endure want of food," referring to a habit ; patiens inediam, * suf*
</p>
<p>fering want of lood," referring to a particular point of time. So

<p>also doctus linguam Lotinam, " one who has been taught the Latin

<p>12. Simulator. The verb simulare, whence this noun is formed,
</p>
<p>means " to pretend to be what we are not ;" but dissimulare, " to
</p>
<p>dissemble, or conceal what we are." It is the character of hypocrisy
</p>
<p>to pretend to virtues which it has not, (simulare,) and to dissemble
</p>
<p>the vices which it has, (dissimulare.)
</p>
<p>13. Satis loqucntiac. " Possessing fluency of speech enough."
</p>
<p>Several editions have eloquentiae, but this would be too strong here,
</p>
<p>although the reading appears in a majority of the MSS. The dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between loquentia and eloquentia is well pointed out in the

<p>15. Post doimnatunicm. This expression is equivalent, not to

<p>historical infinitives, that is, the infinitive is used for the imperfect.

<p>Compare Jugurtha, note 4, page 4.

</p>
<p>Bentley (ad. Horat. Epod. 11, 3) correctly lays down the distinc-
</p>
<p>tion between percellere and pcrcutcre, as follows : " Utrumque <U

<p>Some understand causa, which actually appears in a few manu-

<p>scripts and editions. Scheller, however, from a review of this and

<p>12. Dominationcmque. "And tyranny." The Romans always
</p>
<p>attached an improper meaning to the term dominus, the root of
</p>
<p>dominatio, using it in the sense of " tyrant," " a master of slaves,"

<p><kc. On this account Augustus refused the name.

</p>
<p>The term impcrium, in its stricter acceptation, accords better with

<p>definite and particular period of time than the latter. <0 pew

<p>facinus. " Such an exploit." Facinus, as has already been remarked Q3
</p>
<p>in the Notes to the Jugurthine War, denotes " a bold or daring ac-
</p>
<p>tion," and, unless it be joined with a favourable epithet, or the
</p>
<p>action be previously described as commendable, the term is always
</p>
<p>to be understood in a vituperative sense. In the present case, the
</p>
<p>previous description of the action fixes its character. ( Vid. Crombie's
</p>
<p>Gymnasium, vol. 2, p. 159 )
</p>
<p>3. Eos divitias, &c. " These they considered riches, this an
</p>
<p>honourable fame," &c.  Divitias honestas. "Moderate wealth."
</p>
<p>The expression divitias honestas is the same as divitias bonis
</p>
<p>artibus partas, adeoque mediocres.
</p>
<p>4. Ni ea res, &c. " Were it not that such a detail might draw
</p>
<p>me off too far from my subject." Ea res is regarded by some as
</p>
<p>an archaism for id ; but this mode of expression occurs in the best
</p>
<p>writers, though Sallust uses it more frequently than others.
</p>
<p>5. Res cunctas. For cuncta. Consult preceding note.  Cele-
</p>
<p>brat obscuratque. " Raises to eminence, and, again, buries in
</p>
<p>oblivion."
</p>
<p>6. Scriptorum magna imjenia. More elegant than scriptores
</p>
<p>magni ingenii, which is, however, the meaning of the phrase :
</p>
<p>"writers of great talent." Compare Curtius (3, 2, 13,) robora
</p>
<p>virorum, for viri robustissimi, and Catullus, (64, 4,) robora pubis,
</p>
<p>for adolescentes robusti. The writers to whom Sallust alludes are,
</p>
<p>without doubt, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, &c. Some
</p>
<p>critics have regarded scriptorum in this passage as a mere gloss,
</p>
<p>especially as some manuscripts omit it, and others place it after
</p>
<p>ingenia, but its presence is necessary to the sense.
</p>
<p>7. Earn. Referring to virtutcm understood. Some editors read
</p>
<p>ea, understanding facta.  Ea copia. " That advantage." Kuhn-
</p>
<p>hardt thinks copia equivalent to multitudo, but incorrectly we con-
</p>
<p>ceive. If his explanation, however, should be preferred, ea copia
</p>
<p>mav be rendered, M the same number of able historians."

<p>Scheller's explanation is perfectly satisfactory. He makes the

<p>done either to supplicate the Deity, whence we have the kindred

<p>meaning of " religious worship ;" or it may be for the purpose of

</p>
<p>gium: {Contagio quasi, "by a sort of moral contagion.") The
</p>
<p>Bipont edition removes the comma after quasi, placing one after
</p>
<p>contagio, and another after pestilentia. Contagio then becomes the
</p>
<p>nominative to invasit. In either reading, contagio has vitiorum
</p>
<p>understood.
</p>
<p>11. Propius virtutem erat. Sallust means, that ambition, though
</p>
<p>a vice, has some affinity to virtue, which cupidity has not. Virtutem
</p>
<p>is governed by ad understood. We find the preposition supplied in
</p>
<p>Plautus, (Mil. Glor. 4, 6, 55,) " Si accesserit prope ad tc ;" and
</p>
<p>again, {Mostcll 2, 2, 30,) " Fuge ad me propius:'

<p>13. Studium habet. " Implies the desire."
</p>
<p>14. Venenis malis. " With poisons." Venenum, like f acinus,
</p>
<p>&c, is what the grammarians call medium nomen. It properly
</p>
<p>signifies " that which by its penetrating influence changes the natural
</p>
<p>qualities of any thing." As this may be either beneficial or injurious,
</p>
<p>xcncnum hence may indicate in the latter case " a poison," and in
</p>
<p>the former " a drug," " a medicine," " a colouring matter." In this
</p>
<p>passage Sallust uses the term in its strict acceptation, and therefore
</p>
<p>adds the qualifying adjective ; so that venenis malis, when literally
</p>
<p>rendered, will signify " with pernicious (or poisonous) drugs," i. e.
</p>
<p>poisons. This, after all, however, is somewhat of an affected
</p>
<p>archaism on the part of our historian, since the purest Latin writers
</p>
<p>are accustomed to use the word venenum, when standing alone, in a
</p>
<p>bad sense, without employing any adjective. The old form of ex-
</p>
<p>pression occurs in a law cited by Cicero, (pro Cluent. 54,) " Qui

</p>
<p>He who possesses much is as strongly influenced by the desire of
</p>
<p>having more, as he whose present resources are scanty ; and while
</p>
<p>want urges on the latter, the possession of abundant means does not
</p>
<p>quench the thirst for gain in the former. The desire of wealth makes

<p>both of them its slaves.

</p>
<p>attaining to the unlimited control of the state, argued well for its
</p>
<p>interests. He favoured the party of the nobility, which Marios,
</p>
<p>plebeian in origin, had always sought to depress, and he seemed on
</p>
<p>the point also of reviving the ancient constitution The mask,
</p>
<p>however, was soon dropped, and the most horrid excesses ensued.

<p>He then refers in support of it to Virgil Aen 2, 540. Or id.

<p>1, 442. Cic. N. D. 1, 42, &c. He gives also in amicis, in the 9th

</p>
<p>country, the abode of pleasure."  Amare. potare. " To indulge
</p>
<p>in the excesses of licentiousness and intoxication." Potare is M to

</p>
<p>naturae necessitatem ; potant ebriosi arfluenter, et ad ebrietatem."
</p>
<p>(Popma.) As Sallust means to say that the Roman soldiers had
</p>
<p>acquired in Asia the habit of drinking to excess, biberc would evi-
</p>
<p>dently have been inadmissible in the text.

<p>4. Innocentia, &c. "A life of innocence in another was regarded Q5
</p>
<p>as the mere offspring of a malevolent feeling," i. e. they gave him
</p>
<p>who led a virtuous life no credit for sincerity, but supposed him to
</p>
<p>be actuated merely by a spirit of malevolence and opposition, and a
</p>
<p>wish to set his own mode of life in direct contrast with that of the
</p>
<p>profligate, in order that it might carry with it a tacit censure on the
</p>
<p>conduct of the latter.

<p>5. Rapere, consumere. ' They plundered, they wasted."
</p>
<p>6. Pudorem, pudicitiam, &c. " Modesty, chastity, things divine
</p>
<p>and human without distinction, they utterly disregarded, and in then-
</p>
<p>violation of them acted without the least compunction or self-
</p>
<p>restraint." Seneca (de Benef. 1, 9) has borrowed some of his

<p>ideas and expressions from this and the preceding passages of

<p>Sallust. "Jam rapta spargere, sparsa pari avaritia recolligere

</p>
<p>phatic vero.
</p>
<p>8. Procter itijuriae licentiam. " Except the power of injuring."
</p>
<p>9. Victor es. Some manuscripts have victis instead of victor es,
</p>
<p>but the former is implied in the latter, and therefore need not be
</p>
<p>expressed. Other manuscripts give hostibus, but this again is
</p>
<p>already implied in the term sociis. " Quasi socios istos" observes

<p>Cortius, " non olim hostcs fuisse per se constet"

</p>
<p>refers to the piscinae, or fish-ponds, which the wealthy Romans
</p>
<p>caused to be formed, generally on the seashore, by the damming up
</p>
<p>of the waters, and which were commonly of such vast dimensions
</p>
<p>as almost to deserve the name of seas. Some editions, however,

<p>many of the Roman nobility, built on large artificial moles projecting

<p>into the sea. Contracta, which other manuscripts present, is pro-
</p>
<p>bably a mere gloss. If otherwise considered, it may be supposed to
</p>
<p>allude to the encroachments made upon the limits of the ocean by
</p>
<p>these moles and marine palaces. Compare, as regards this last

<p>reading, Horace, (Carm. 3, 1, 33,) " Contracta pisces aequora
</p>
<p>se7itiunt, ,} &c.
</p>
<p>11. Turpidinem. An old form for turpitudinem. The nomina-
</p>
<p>tive turpido occurs in Tertullian (decor, mil. c. 14.) Gesner thinks
</p>
<p>this an error for turpitudo, but without any necessity.

<p>compare Seneca, Epist. 89, ad fin. Aulas Gellius, 7, 16, and Lu-
</p>
<p>can, 4, 373.

<p>14. Animus imbutus, &c. " The heart, once contaminated by
</p>
<p>evil inclinations, could not easily forego the gratification of its vicious

<p>propensities." By lubidinibas are here properly meant the ruling
</p>
<p>propensities and desires of the heart.

<p>norosorum, the abstract for the concrete. M Of all kinds of profli-

</p>
<p>a previous note, means a bold or daring action. Flagitium, though
</p>
<p>generally referring to lustful excess, denotes any fault, error, or
</p>
<p>crime, which reflects more or less disgrace on the offender ; and im-
</p>
<p>plies a less degree of moral guilt than scclus. ( Crombus Gymna-

<p>12. Cumvirgine nobili. Who the female here alluded to was Qg
</p>
<p>is not clearly ascertained. It is generally thought that the histo-
</p>
<p>rians of those times suppressed the name out of respect for the noble
</p>
<p>lineage to which she belonged. The daughter who was the offspring
</p>
<p>of this intercourse is spoken of by Plutarch, (vit. Cic. 10, ed. Hut-
</p>
<p>ten, vol. 5, p. 318,) and is referred to by Cicero, (frag. orat. in tog.
</p>
<p>cand. ed. Ernesti, vol. 7, p. 1052,) " Cum ex eodem stupro" &c.
</p>
<p>13. Sacerdote Vestae. The vestal of whom mention is here
</p>
<p>made was Fabia Terentia. She was brought to trial by Clodius
</p>
<p>for a violation of her vow. Several of the most respectable citizens,
</p>
<p>however, either convinced of her innocence, or wishing to thwart the
</p>
<p>tribune, exerted themselves in her defence with such success, that
</p>
<p>she not only obtained sentence of acquittal, but her prosecutor was
</p>
<p>obliged to flee from Rome. Cato, Catulus, and Cicero, espoused
</p>
<p>her cause. She was the sister of Terentia, the wife of Cicero. In the
</p>
<p>picture which Cicero draws of the scandalous misdeeds of Catiline,
</p>
<p>no mention is made by him of this incident, probably out of respect
</p>
<p>for his sister-in-law.  The Vestal virgins were introduced at Rome
</p>
<p>by Numa, in imitation of a similar priesthood existing at Alba.
</p>
<p>They were originally four in number. Two were subsequently
</p>
<p>added by Tarquinius Priscus, or by Servius Tullius, and six con-
</p>
<p>tinued to be the number ever after. These priestesses had charge
</p>
<p>of the sacred fire, and were bound to inviolable chastity. When
</p>
<p>convicted of dishonour, they were buried alive in the campus scele-
</p>
<p>ratus, and their paramours scourged to death in the forum. (Vid.
</p>
<p>Lipsius de Vesta et Vestalibus, Ant v. 1603.)

</p>
<p>nominative to the verb. Nubere, " to veil," or duci, " to be led," is
</p>
<p>used when a woman is the subject of discourse, or nominative to
</p>
<p>the verb. The ellipsis is supplied in the case of the former verb, by
</p>
<p>domum, in the latter by se. Thus, Ttane tandum uxorem (domum)
</p>
<p>duxit Antipho ? because the husband led the bride to his own abode
</p>
<p>from her father's house. Tullw (se) nupsit, literally, " she has
</p>
<p>veiled herself for Tullius," because the bride was veiled during the
</p>
<p>ceremony of marriage. The same distinction holds good in Greek
</p>
<p>between ya/!a>, and ya^io^iai, although depending on a different

<p>explanation. Thus ya^lo), " I marry," is said of the husband, (uxo-

<p>7. Rapinarum et victoriae, &c. Sylla, after the final success of

</p>
<p>travagant and dissolute living, however, soon scattered this ill-got-
</p>
<p>ten wealth, and consequent poverty made them ripe for any new
</p>
<p>commotion in the state. " Hi sunt homines ," observes Cicero, " ex
</p>
<p>iis colwiiis, qv as Sulla constituit, coloni, qui se inspe-
</p>

</p>
<p>which have been advanced, we consider that of Planche the most
</p>
<p>correct. The period referred to in the text is the beginning of the
</p>
<p>year of Rome 690 : not long previous to this, (A. U. C. 688,) Cati-
</p>
<p>line, returning from the government of Africa, was accused of ex-
</p>
<p>tortion, and prevented from suing for the consulship, in conse-

</p>
<p>11. Kalendas Junius. The Roman Calendar agreed with our
</p>
<p>own, in the number of months, and of the days in each ; but instead
</p>
<p>of reckoning in an uninterrupted series, from the first to the thirty-
</p>
<p>first, they had three points from which their days were counted. 
</p>
<p>1. The Calends or Kalends, which were always the first day of the
</p>
<p>month. Thev received their name from the old verb colore, be-
</p>
<p>232 NOTES TO THE

</p>
<p>g*y cause the priests, who had the charge of the Calendar, were required
</p>
<p>to proclaim the first day of the month publicly to the people, and to
</p>
<p>mention at the same time, the number of days between the Calends
</p>
<p>and the Nones. This last was done, because it behoved the people
</p>
<p>who lived in the country, to assemble in the city on the Nones of
</p>
<p>each month, in order to be informed by the rex sacrorum of the
</p>
<p>feasts and holidays, and to learn in general what they had to do, in
</p>
<p>regard to sacred matters, during that month.  2. The Nones were,
</p>
<p>in the months of March, May, July, and October, on the seventh ;
</p>
<p>in all other months on the fifth. They were so called because
</p>
<p>there were nine days, counting inclusively, between them and the
</p>
<p>Ides.  3. The Ides were on the fifteenth of March, May, July, and
</p>
<p>October, and on the thirteenth of the other months. They were so
</p>
<p>named from the old verb iduare, because they nearly divided the
</p>
<p>month. The Romans always counted forwards to the Calends,
</p>
<p>Nones, or Ides, never backwards from them. After the first day of
</p>
<p>the month, therefore, they began to reckon so many days before the
</p>
<p>Nones ; after the Nones, so many days before the Ides ; after the
</p>
<p>Ides, so many days before the Calends of the next month. It is to
</p>
<p>be observed that the Romans, in computing their time, always
</p>
<p>included the day from which, and also the day to which, they reck-
</p>
<p>oned : thus they called the 1st January, Cale?idae ; the 31st Decem-
</p>
<p>ber, pridie Calendas or Calendarum ; and the 30th, not secundo, but
</p>
<p>tertio (ante) Calendas.  The year of the city when the circum-
</p>
<p>stances, mentioned in the text, took place, was A. U. C. 690,
</p>
<p>B. C. 64.

<p>12. L. Caesare. For this and the other proper names mentioned
</p>
<p>in the present chapter, consult Historical Index.
</p>
<p>13. Colo'niis et munieiptis. A colony was a portion of Roman
</p>
<p>citizens or Latin allies sent out by public authority, either to take
</p>
<p>possession of lands captured in war, and to found thereon a new
</p>
<p>city, or to occupy cities which had fallen under the Roman sway.

<p>The municipia were foreign towns, whose inhabitants obtained the
</p>
<p>rights of Roman citizens. Of these there were different kinds. Some
</p>
<p>possessed all the rights of Roman citizens, except such as could not
</p>
<p>be enjoyed without residing at Rome. Others enjoyed the right of
</p>
<p>serving in the Roman legion, but had not the right of voting and of
</p>
<p>obtaining civil offices. The appellation is derived from munus and
</p>
<p>capio.

</p>
<p>suis.

<p>1 7. M. Licinium Crassum. Crassus had already borne the offi-
</p>
<p>ces of praetor and consul, and was remarkable for the extent of his
</p>
<p>private wealth. Not long after the period of the conspiracy, he
</p>
<p>united with Pompey and Caesar in forming the first triumvirate.
</p>
<p>(A. U. C. 693.) He was slain in his expedition against the Par-
</p>
<p>thians. (A. U. C. 700.)

<p>2. L. Tullo, &c. A. U. C. 688.

<p>3. Legibus ambitus interrogati. The laws against bribery were very
</p>
<p>severe. If the successful candidates were convicted of that crime
</p>
<p>upon trial, they were deprived of the consulship, and their competi-
</p>
<p>tors who accused them were nominated in their place. They were
</p>
<p>also, besides being fined, declared incapable of bearing any office,
</p>
<p>or of coining into the senate, by the Calpurnian and other laws.
</p>
<p>Cicero made the punishment of bribery still more severe by the
</p>
<p>Tullian law, which he caused to be passed through the authority of
</p>
<p>the senate, by the additional penalty of a ten years' exile.
</p>
<p>4. Poenas dederant. In these, and similar phrases, it should be
</p>
<p>observed, that the proper meaning of the term poena is not " punish-
</p>
<p>ment," but " atonement." Thus dare poenas is, " to give satisfac-
</p>
<p>tion," " to make atonement," or " to be punished :" and sumere poe-
</p>
<p>nas is, " to exact atonement," " to take satisfaction," or " to pun-
</p>
<p>ish." Compare the corresponding Greek forms Sovvai SUrjv and
</p>
<p>XaffeTv Strtiv.

</p>
<p>make it. When in the genitive, it has pecuniarum either expressed,
</p>
<p>as in this passage, or more commonly understood. When in the
</p>
<p>ablative, pecuniis. The action was so termed because by it the
</p>
<p>money wrongfully obtained from an individual was demanded back.
</p>
<p>Our English word extortion, though generally given as the transla-
</p>
<p>tion of the term, is not, however, comprehensive enough, since the
</p>
<p>action repetundarum, was brought not merely for the recovery of
</p>
<p>what had been extorted from the individual who complained, but
</p>
<p>also for what had been obtained by the Roman governors under

<p>false pretences or by fraud. Catiline had been appointed a praetor,

</p>
<p>the 17 immediately preceding. (Vid. Ernesti, Clav. Cic. roc. Tri-

</p>
<p>law to give in his name during these 17 days, and required at the

<p>same time to be free from all accusation. If any charge were

<p>pending against him, he could not sue for the office in question.

</p>
<p>whom, Caesar was connected with Piso in this conspiracy, and,
</p>
<p>while the latter attempted an insurrection against the government

<p>abroad, the former was to have excited sedition against the admin-
</p>
<p>istration at home.

<p>13 Fascibus correptis. " Having seized upon the consular
</p>
<p>power." The fasces were a bundle of rods, with an axe tied in the
</p>
<p>middle of them, which were carried before the kings, and afterwards

<p>before the consuls, as an emblem of their power. Valerius Popli-

<p>cola had a law passed, which took away the securis or axe from the

<p>only left them the right of scourging. This last, however, rm

<p>15. Ea re cognita. Suetonius (vit. Caes. 9.) makes mention of
</p>
<p>a plot in which Caesar and Crassus were said to have been en-
</p>
<p>gaged at this time. Their plan was to make an attack on the sen-
</p>
<p>ate at the beginning of the year, and, after they had slain whom
</p>
<p>they pleased of that body, for Crassus to assume the dictatorship
</p>
<p>and appoint Caesar his master of the horse. Crassus, either from
</p>
<p>repentance or fear, {poenitcntia vel mctu,) came not at the day ap-
</p>
<p>pointed, and Caesar consequently did not give the signal which had
</p>
<p>been agreed upon, the dropping namely of his toga from his shoulders.
</p>
<p>The plot therefore failed. Suetonius makes no mention either of Cati-
</p>
<p>line or Piso as connected with this conspiracy, although it is evident
</p>
<p>that he and Sallust refer to one and the same event. A subsequent
</p>
<p>plot between Caesar and Piso has already been alluded to in note 7.

<p>exigencies of the state. The quaestors had charge of the public

<p>the public revenues. The principal charge of the city quaestors

<p>26. Adgressos. For aggressos. This is generally termed an gg
</p>
<p>archaism ; but, according to Scheller, it is a question whether the
</p>
<p>ancients ever altered the form of the preposition when in composi-
</p>
<p>tion. He considers it always more accurate to retain as far as
</p>
<p>possible the prepositions in an unaltered form, as adfcro, adtuli,

<p>10. Tetrarchae. " Tetrarchs." Tetrarcha originally signified
</p>
<p>one who ruled over the fourth part of a country or kingdom, (from
</p>
<p>Tirrapa and dpxfi.) Afterwards, however, the term merely came to
</p>
<p>denote a minor or inferior potentate, without any reference to the
</p>
<p>extent of territory governed. Thus, according to Strabo, Galio-
</p>
<p>Graecia in Asia Minor was governed at first by twelve tetrarchs,
</p>
<p>afterwards by three, and lastly by two, previous to its being made a
</p>
<p>kingdom.
</p>
<p>11. Vectigales. Strictly speaking, the Stipendiarii, or Tribu-
</p>
<p>tarii, were those who paid their taxes in money ; and the Vectigales
</p>
<p>were those who gave a certain part of the produce of the soil to the
</p>
<p>republic. The words, however, as in the present instance, are
</p>
<p>sometimes confounded.
</p>
<p>12. Populi, nationes, &c. Gens is the root or stock, containing
</p>
<p>many families, (familiae,) or even nations, (nationes.) It is the
</p>
<p>generic term in respect to natio and familia. Thus the Germans
</p>
<p>may be called gens, the Saxons natio; or, if we rise higher, the
</p>
<p>Europeans may be called gens, the Germans natio. Gens is even
</p>
<p>sometimes applied to the whole human race ; as, M Gens homxnum
</p>
<p>est huic belluae adversa." (PI in. H. N. 8, 25.) Populus is more
</p>
<p>extensive than natio, but in general less so than gens, though in-
</p>
<p>stances are not unfrequent where populus &nd gens directly coincide.
</p>
<p>The term populi in the text may be rendered by " communities."

</p>

</p>
<p>Suetonius, (vit. Cats. 46,) " Mu?iditiarum lautitiarumque studio-

</p>
<p>writing materials of the Romans were tablets covered with wax,
</p>
<p>paper, and parchment. Their stylus was broad at one end ; so that
</p>
<p>when they wished to correct or erase any thing, they turned the
</p>
<p>stylus, and smoothed the wax with the broad end, after which the
</p>
<p>tablets might be written on anew. Hence when debts were dis-
</p>
<p>charged, the former marks were smoothed over, and the tablets
</p>
<p>were ready for a new score.

</p>
<p>scription. Upon his return to the city, after having overthrown
</p>
<p>the party of Marius, he wrote down the names of those whom he
</p>
<p>doomed to die, and ordered them to be fixed up in the public places
</p>
<p>of the city, with the promise of a certain reward (duo talenta) for
</p>
<p>the head of each person so proscribed. New lists (tabulae proscmp-
</p>
<p>tionis) were repeatedly exposed, as new victims occurred to his
</p>
<p>memory or were suggested to him. The land and fortunes of the
</p>
<p>slain were divided among the friends of Sylla. Catiline promised
</p>
<p>a repetition of these enormities to his followers.

</p>
<p>significant of express and certain engagements and those made by

</p>
<p>Etrusker, vol. 1, p. 12.
</p>
<p>2. Manlium. This Manlius had held a commission in the army
</p>
<p>of Sylla, under whom he had acquired considerable military experi-
</p>
<p>ence, and accumulated great wealth, which he soon dissipated by
</p>
<p>his excessive extravagance. Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Appian,
</p>
<p>write the name MuXAio? ; and hence it would seem that Mallius,
</p>
<p>which is the reading of a few manuscripts, is more correct than
</p>
<p>Manlius. The editions of Sallust, however, give the latter form,
</p>
<p>with very few exceptions.
</p>
<p>3. Princeps belli faciundi. " The first to begin the war."
</p>
<p>4. Adscivisse. Understand sibi, which is expressed in some
</p>
<p>editions.
</p>
<p>b. Quae, ubi aetas, &c. " Who, when years had set bounds to
</p>
<p>their sources of gain, but not to their luxurious indulgences." Nequt
</p>
<p>is here equivalent to et non.
</p>
<p>6. Servitia urbana. "The city slaves." Servitium, in the sin-
</p>
<p>gular, means " slavery," &c. In a few instances, however, it has
</p>
<p>the same signification as the plural. Compare Cic. in Vert. 7, 4, a

</p>
<p>9. Viro. She married Decimus Junius Brutus, who held the con-
</p>
<p>sulship with M. Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, A. U. C. 677.
</p>
<p>10. Psallere. This verb, from the Greek ifaXXw, means either
</p>
<p>to play upon a musical instrument, or to accompany it at the same
</p>
<p>time with the voice.  The infinitives psallere and saltarc, and like-
</p>
<p>wise the accusative multa alia, depend on docta.
</p>
<p>11. Elegantius. " With more elegance." "With more skill."

<p>This word seems used in a bad sense, referring to loose, indecent,
</p>
<p>and theatrical gestures in dancing, which, at the same time, how-

<p>Page,
</p>
<p>ever, were not ungraceful. In the earlier period of the Roman GO
</p>
<p>republic, both dancing and music were held in little repute. After
</p>
<p>the adoption of Grecian customs and habits, more regard was paid
</p>
<p>to them, and they met with less censure, especially music. In the
</p>
<p>corrupt ages of the empire, when public morals were at their lowest
</p>
<p>ebb, dancing of course came fully into vogue, and without any
</p>
<p>blame being attached to it. It may perhaps excite our surprise that
</p>
<p>the Romans should have condemned what we regard as so innocent
</p>
<p>an amusement ; but we should bear in mind, that the dancing which
</p>
<p>the Romans censored can only be compared with the worst species
</p>
<p>of our opera-dancing, since they had also their religious dances,
</p>
<p>those of the Salii in particular, which were sanctioned by the prac-
</p>
<p>tice of ages. The Latin verb which we translate " to dance," pro-
</p>
<p>perly signifies, co leap high and frequently ; the corresponding Greek
</p>
<p>verb (vpxeofjiai) has a similar meaning : Plato in his Cratylus explains
</p>
<p>it by ixerccjpi^u} and -rdWio : so Antiphanes in Athenaeus, p. 688,
</p>
<p>b., has the expression Kapdia dp^elrai, the heart leaps, for Kapdia
</p>
<p>TTr]6a.
</p>
<p>12. Iustrumenta luxuriae. " The instruments of vice."
</p>
<p>13. Creditum abjuraverat. " Had foresworn a trust reposed in
</p>
<p>her."  Praeceps abierat. " Had plunged headlong into ruin."
</p>
<p>14. Varum ingenium ejus, &c. " Her native powers, however,
</p>
<p>were far from contemptible."
</p>
<p>15. Facetiae. Facetiae denotes gracefulness in general, or that
</p>
<p>elegance of wit and humour, which indicates a correct and delicate
</p>
<p>taste.  The primary idea implied in Lepos, and lepidus, is sweetness
</p>
<p>or softness, opposed to what is harsh and rough, and the term is
</p>
<p>confined to the mode of expression : whereas facetiae is applicable
</p>
<p>to the sentiment as well as the diction or gesture, designating the
</p>
<p>character of the mind, as possessed of taste and judgment. (Vid.
</p>
<p>Crombie's Gymnasium, vol. 2, p. 39.) If, after these premises, we

<p>16. Designatus. Consult note 13, page 105.
</p>
<p>17. Dolus, aut as tutiae. " Dexterity or address." Dolus is here
</p>
<p>equivalent to what the civilians call dolus bonus, i. e. a stratagem
</p>
<p>put in operation against an enemy, in one's own defence. Thus
</p>
<p>Ulpian remarks : " Veteres dolum etiam bouum dicebant, et pro

<p>19. Pactions promnciat. The province of Macedonia had fallen
</p>
<p>to the lot of Cicero, but he generously yielded it to Antonius, who,
</p>
<p>being in indigent circumstances by reason of his dissipated life, was
</p>
<p>the more easily inclined to receive a rich province as the price of
</p>
<p>his adherence to the state. Antonius held the government of Mace-
</p>
<p>donia for two years after the expiration of his consulship, and, on his
</p>
<p>return to Rome, was brought to trial and sentenced to perpetual
</p>
<p>banishment, for extortion, and for making war beyond the bounds
</p>
<p>of his province. (Lie. epit. 103.) Before his elevation to the con-
</p>
<p>sulship, the censors had expelled him from the senate. He appears
</p>
<p>to have been a man of profligate habits.

<p>21 . Clicntium. The institution of patronage and clientship owed
</p>
<p>its origin to Romulus, according to the common account. That the
</p>
<p>patricians and plebeians might be connected together by the strictest
</p>
<p>bonds, the monarch ordained that even' plebeian should choose from
</p>
<p>the patricians any one he pleased as his patron, or protector, whose
</p>
<p>clicrit he was called. It was the part of the patron to advise and
</p>
<p>to defend his client, to assist him with his interest and substance ;
</p>
<p>in short, to do every thing for him that a parent uses to do for his
</p>
<p>children. The client was obliged to pay all kind of respect to his
</p>
<p>patron and to serve him with his life and fortune in any extremity.
</p>
<p>As regards the origin, however, of this relation between the two
</p>
<p>orders, it is more than probable that the common account is incor-
</p>
<p>rect. The institution of patronage would seem to have sprung from
</p>
<p>a state of society in which a superior caste exercised sway over an
</p>
<p>inferior one : nor is this one of the least interesting objects of
</p>
<p>inquiry connected with the early history of Rome.

</p>
<p>5. Cum telo esse. " Carried a weapon about with him." This
</p>
<p>phraseology is adopted from a law of the twelve tables, by which it
</p>
<p>was forbidden to wear any weapon in the city. Compare Cicero,
</p>
<p>(pro Milone, 4,) " Quae (lex) non modo hominem occidi, sed esse
</p>
<p>cum telo hominis occidendi causa tetat.' n Upon any sudden provo-
</p>
<p>cation the Romans used the graphium or stylus as a weapon, which
</p>
<p>they carried in a case. Hence probably the origin of the word stiletto
</p>
<p>in Italian.

<p>properly denotes that period of the night which is fit only for repose,

</p>
<p>habet idoneum tempus rebus gerendis"
</p>
<p>9. M. Porcium Laecam. This individual has already been men-
</p>
<p>tioned in the 17th chapter. According to Cicero, (1 in Cat. 4,  pro
</p>
<p>Sulla, 18,) the meeting was held in the house of Laeca, on the night
</p>
<p>of the 6th November, (' ca nocte, quae consccuta est posterum diem
</p>
<p>nonarum Xovcmbns, me (Cicerone) consule.'*) Sallust evidently
</p>
<p>places the time of this meeting too early : he seems to have been
</p>
<p>under the impression that it was held about the close of October,
</p>
<p>since he only mentions the accusation of L. Paullus against Catiline
</p>
<p>(which occurred on the 22d October) in the 31st chapter. . Cicero's
</p>
<p>account agrees with Sallusfs as to this having been merely a par-
</p>
<p>tial meeting at the house of Laeca : " convenisse codem complurcs
</p>
<p>ejusdem amentiae scclerisque soews." Dio Cassius only states that
</p>
<p>Catiline directed his accomplices to assemble by night at a certain
</p>
<p>house, (If oiKiav riva avWeyfjvai' 37, 32.)

<p>10. C. Cornelius, &c. Cicero here differs from Sallust, and
</p>
<p>makes both Cornelius and Vargunteius to have belonged to the
</p>
<p>equestrian order. <k Reperti sunt duo cquites Romani, qui te ista
</p>
<p>cur a liberarent, et sese xlla ipsa nocte paullo ante lucem me meo in
</p>
<p>lectuto interfecturos polliccrentur." (1 in Cat. 4.) The discrepancy,
</p>
<p>however, may easily be removed by supposing that Vargunteius,
</p>
<p>although a senator, was of equestrian extraction and rank. Plu-
</p>
<p>tarch calls the two individuals in question Marcius and Cethegus,
</p>
<p>(vit. Cic. 16, ed. Hutten, vol. 5, p. 236). The account given by
</p>
<p>Appian varies from that of Sallust in one or two particulars, and
</p>
<p>also, like that of Plutarch, in the names. Appian makes Lentulus

</p>
<p>tern" observes Cortius, " hoc est primo mane, illud enim tempus

<p>on the lands of the Etrurians. Compare Cicero, (2, in Cat. 9,)

<p>2. Volgi rumoribus exagitatam. M Noised abroad by reason of

<p>magistrate." The whole passage forms a " locus classicus" in
</p>
<p>relation to the meaning and limits of the famous decree to which it
</p>
<p>alludes. The decree was called U'timum or Extremum. Bv it
</p>
<p>the republic was said to be entrusted to the consuls. For 120 vears
</p>
<p>before Sylla, the creation of a dictator was disused ; but in danger-
</p>
<p>ous emergencies the consuls were armed with dictatorial power bv

<p>a decree of this nature.

</p>
<p>Cortius, and others, however, prefer nulli. It is questioned whether QA
</p>
<p>nulli be the dative case, according to the common form of declining,
</p>
<p>or the genitive, according to the older mode of inflection. It is
</p>
<p>thought by many that the position of the words strongly favours the
</p>
<p>latter opinion. We take the liberty of dissenting from this. The
</p>
<p>common mode of explaining the passage we consider perfectly
</p>
<p>unexceptionable : " without an express order of the people, no con-
</p>
<p>sul has the right of interfering in these things."

<p>7. Recitavit. "Read aloud."  Legere. " To read/' " to peruse

</p>
<p>8. Ante diem sextum Kalendas Novembris. " On the sixth day
</p>
<p>before the Kalends of November," i. e. the 27th October. The
</p>
<p>Latin phrase is equivalent to die sexto ante Kalendas, or, according
</p>
<p>to the more usual form, sexto Kalendas. Ernesti and others make
</p>
<p>diem to be governed by in understood, which s expressed in many
</p>
<p>instances. Compare Cicero, Phil. 3, 8, " in ante diem iv. Kal.
</p>
<p>Dec.," &c, and 1, in Cat. 3, "Dixi ego idem in senatu, cae-
</p>
<p>dem te optimatum contulisse in ante diem v. Kai. Novembres."
</p>
<p>Zumpt, in his larger grammar, thinks that these apparently anoma-
</p>
<p>lous phrases probably arose from a transposition of ante ; and that
</p>
<p>having once written ante die tertio Kalendas, they would easily be
</p>
<p>led to change die into diem, as if it had been governed by ante. In
</p>
<p>his smaller grammar, (Bancroft's transl. p. 233,) he considers ante
</p>
<p>diem in the light of an unchangeable substantive, since prepositions
</p>
<p>which govern the accusative can be set before it. Compare the
</p>
<p>usage of pridie. " Nos in Formiano esse volumus usque ad pridie

<p>lated this rule, their military power instantly ceased, and their

<p>right to a triumph was lost, since no citizen was allowed to hold

<p>QA 13. Calumnia paucorum. " By the cabals of a few individuals."
</p>
<p>Culumnia appears to be used here in a sense which approaches
</p>
<p>very nearly its primitive one. If Priscian's derivation of the term
</p>
<p>from the old verb calvo " to thwart," " to deceive," be the true one,
</p>
<p>(calutum in the supine being the intermediate step,) the original

<p>meaning of culumnia will be, " unfair practices," " cavils," " ca-
</p>
<p>bals," &c.

<p>15. Permissum. " Full power was given." Pcrmittere is " to

</p>
<p>to Herennius, permissio is defined to be, " Rem tradcre, et alicujus
</p>
<p>voluntati concedere." Mandatum, on the other hand, corresponds
</p>
<p>very nearly to our English word " commission."
</p>
<p>16. Pro tempore, &c. " Proportioned to the exigency and the

<p>danger."
</p>
<p>17. Scstertia centum. " One hundred thousand sestertii." One
</p>
<p>thousand sestertii made a sestcrtium, which is the name of a sum, not
</p>
<p>of a coin. The common mode of reckoning among the Romans
</p>
<p>was by sestertii or nummi. The sestertius, " sesterce," was a
</p>
<p>silver coin worth originally two asses and a half, and marked by the
</p>
<p>letters L. L. S. for libra, libra, semis, (two pounds and a half of cop-
</p>
<p>per,) sometimes abbreviated by contracting L. L. into H, thus H. S.
</p>
<p>unless H be an abbreviation or corruption from I. I. or two marks
</p>
<p>of unity, which is far more probable. The oldest Roman money
</p>
<p>was of brass ; and an as, as a coin, was originally a pound of cop-
</p>
<p>per. But after silver began to be coined, (some years before the
</p>
<p>first Punic war.) the as was made to weigh less, at first -$-, then f^ t
</p>
<p>then 2 -^, of the original weight, so that the coin, which at first had
</p>
<p>weighed a pound, at last weighed but half an uncia. Of silver
</p>
<p>coins the denarius was originally equal to 10 asses, and the sester-
</p>
<p>tius, as above mentioned, to two asses and a half. Hence the name
</p>
<p>sestertius, which is shortened from semistertius ; i. e. the first an

<p>Herodot. 1, 50 Matthiae, G. G. vol. 1. page 176. Blomficld's

<p>transl. and Remarks of editor.) After the reduction of the as. how-
</p>
<p>ever, to fa f a pound, the denarius became equal to 16 asses, and
</p>
<p>the sestertius, or quarter of a denarius, was worth now 4 ,w.>\ A
</p>
<p>denarius weighed about 73 Paris grains, but under the first empe-
</p>
<p>rors it was gradually diminished to 63 ; so that in the times of the

</p>
<p>18. Gladiator iaefamiliae. " Troops of gladiators." Gladiators
</p>
<p>were kept and maintained in schools (in ludis) by persons called
</p>
<p>lanistae, who purchased and trained them. The whole number
</p>
<p>under one lanista was called familia. Gladiators were at first
</p>
<p>composed of captives and "laves, or of condemned malefactors.
</p>
<p>But afterwards, in the days of the emperors, even free-born citizens,
</p>
<p>induced by hire or inclination, fought on the arena, some too of
</p>
<p>noble birth.
</p>
<p>19. Minor es magistratus. The higher magistrates were the
</p>
<p>consuls, praetors, and censors : the inferior magistrates were the
</p>
<p>aediles, tribunes, quaestors, &c. (Vid. Aid. Gell. 13, 15.)
</p>
<p>20. Lasavia. This term is commonly rendered " wantonness,"
</p>
<p>a meaning which cannot apply here with any peculiar meaning or
</p>
<p>definite force. It appears to us that " devotion to public amuse-
</p>
<p>ments" will suit the context better. Dureau de Lamalle translates
</p>
<p>the word in question by "licence dissolue."
</p>
<p>21. Diuturna quies. From the time of Sylla down to this period,
</p>
<p>that is, for nearly twenty years, there had been an intermission of
</p>
<p>civil discord.
</p>
<p>1. Adflictare sese. "Were plunged in the deepest affliction." QJ
</p>
<p>The verb adflictare is the frequentative of adfligere, which properly

<p>7. In senatum venit. This took place on the sixth day before
</p>
<p>the ides of November, (the 8th of the month, according to our mode
</p>
<p>of reckoning,) and the meeting of the senate was held in the tem-
</p>
<p>ple of Jupiter Stator, where Cicero had convened that body. The
</p>
<p>attempt on the consul's life (vid. chap. 28,) was made the day pre-
</p>
<p>vious. Cicero informs us that Catiline was shunned by all the
</p>
<p>assembled senators. (Cic. in Cat. 2, 6.)
</p>
<p>8. Praesentiam ejus timens. Catiline's presence in the senate,
</p>
<p>on this occasion, was probably feared by Cicero for two reasons :
</p>
<p>first, lest, with the aid of those members who were implicated in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, he might break forth into some act of violence ; and,
</p>
<p>secondly, lest the very circumstance of his openly appearing in that
</p>
<p>assembly, might lead many to believe that he was an innocent and
</p>
<p>calumniated man.
</p>
<p>9. Orationem habuit, &c. "Delivered an oration, brilliant in
</p>
<p>itself and beneficial in its results to the republic." The speech, to
</p>
<p>which allusion is here made, was the first oration against Catiline.
</p>
<p>So splendid a burst of extemporaneous eloquence deserves far
</p>
<p>higher encomiums than the cold and formal praise bestowed by the
</p>
<p>historian. This oration of Cicero proved of service to the state
</p>
<p>on two accounts : it rendered the conspiracy formed against the
</p>
<p>republic so clear, that no one could doubt its existence, and it com-
</p>
<p>pelled Catiline to retire from the city.

<p>eloquence  and the adjuration to him, by flying from Rome, to free

<p>his country from such a pestilence, were all wonderfully calculated

<p>"to take one's seat."  Adsidere. " To keep one's seat," " to be

<p>sitting by the side of." The former is compounded of ad, and
</p>
<p>sidere " to settle," or "be fixed."
</p>
<p>12. Ut omnia bona in spe haberet. " As to entertain hopes of

</p>
<p>and those of his ancestors, very many kindnesses had been received
</p>
<p>by the Roman commons."
</p>
<p>14. Inquilinus civis. "An adventitious citizen." Inquilinus
</p>
<p>civis properly denoted one who was not born at Rome, but who
</p>
<p>possessed the rights of citizenship, having no house of his own,- but
</p>
<p>occupying a hired lodging. Cicero, who was born at Arpinum, is
</p>
<p>here sneeringly termed an adventitious citizen, lodging in the city.
</p>
<p>Compare Appian, (Bell. civ. 2,) eg fiiv ayvoyaiav yivovg, KAINON

</p>
<p>on the occasion alluded to in the text, Catiline attempted to address
</p>
<p>the house in defence of his conduct, before Cicero rose up ; but
</p>
<p>that when he began to speak, the senators interrupted him in such
</p>
<p>a manner that he could not be heard. He is silent respecting any
</p>
<p>reply having be" en made by him to the oration of the consul. It
</p>
<p>would appear from this, but more especially from a remark of
</p>
<p>Cicero, in his speech for Muraena, (chapter 25,) that the narrative
</p>
<p>of Sallust is here erroneous. According to Cicero, Catiline uttered
</p>
<p>a threat similar to that mentioned in the text, a few days before,
</p>
<p>when replying to Cato, who menaced him in the presence of the
</p>
<p>senate with a public trial. Cicero, moreover, (2 Cat. 6,) in giving
</p>
<p>an account to the people, on the following day, of what had passed
</p>
<p>in the senate when he openly charged Catiline with his guilt, states
</p>
<p>expressly that the latter, in spite of his boldness, did not dare to
</p>
<p>make any reply to his speech. We find the same remark also in
</p>
<p>the Orator, 37, 129. Florus and Valerius Maximus copy the error
</p>
<p>of Sallust.
</p>
<p>15. Parricidam. Catiline is here styled " a parricide," because
</p>
<p>plotting the destruction of his country, the common parent of all.

</p>
<p>the conflagration which threatens me." A metaphor taken from the
</p>
<p>demolition of an edifice for the purpose of stopping a conflagration.
</p>
<p>The edifice in this case was his native country.
</p>
<p>17. Insidiae consuli. Some understand factae, but the ellipsis
</p>
<p>is unnecessary, as the dative depends at once upon the preceding
</p>
<p>noun. So, " Semen satui" {Cato. R. R. 5,) " Causa rebus crcan-
</p>
<p>dis" (Auson. Ephem.) "Rebus humanis praeses" {Senec. ad.
</p>
<p>Polyb. 31.) Compare also our author's own expression in this same

<p>construction in this passage, by which expert es is first joined with
</p>
<p>a genitive and immediately after with ablatives. This change of
</p>
<p>case is not unfrequent in Sallust. Thus, " Poenam sibi oneri, ?'m-
</p>
<p>p unitatem perdundaie republic ae fore.'' 1 (Cat. chap. 46.) " Ubi vidct

</p>
<p>account of its having been occasioned by the conduct of a usurer Qg
</p>
<p>named Lucius Papirins. It was passed A. U. C. 428, and ordained
</p>
<p>that no person should be held in fetters or stocks, except convicted
</p>
<p>of a crime, and in order to punishment ; but that, for money due, the
</p>
<p>goods of the debtor, not his person, should be answerable. (Liv>
</p>
<p>8, 28.) Livy remarks of this law, that it broke one of the strongest
</p>
<p>bonds of credit. " Victum eo die, ob impotentem injuriam unius,
</p>
<p>ingens vinculum fidei." On this account, as may well be supposed,
</p>
<p>it was unfavourably received by the rich, and had to be re-enacted
</p>
<p>forty years afterwards, at the time of the secession to the Janiculum.
</p>
<p>6. Liberum corpus habere. The cruelty and oppression, which
</p>
<p>marked the conduct of the rich towards their unfortunate debtors,
</p>
<p>occasioned most, if not all, of the disturbances that interfered with
</p>
<p>the earlier growth of the Roman state.
</p>
<p>7. Praetoris. To the praetors belonged the general administra-
</p>
<p>tion of public justice. The city praetor {praetor urbanus) is here
</p>
<p>alluded to : he took cognizance of all litigations between citizens.
</p>
<p>The praetor peregrinus dispensed justice to foreigners at Rome, or
</p>
<p>to foreigners and citizens when involved in controversy.
</p>
<p>8. Major es vestrum. Almost all the manuscripts have vestri for
</p>
<p>vestrum; but, according to Aulus Gellius, (20, 6,) the oldest copies
</p>
<p>in his time exhibited vestrum. Correct Latinity requires this latter
</p>
<p>form in the present case. Nostri and vestri are used when the
</p>
<p>genitive denotes the object ; as amor nostri, cur a nostri, miserere
</p>
<p>nostri, &c, but nostrum and vestrum must be employed when the
</p>
<p>genitive indicates the subject ; as frequentia vestrum, contentio
</p>
<p>vestrum, &c. (Vid. Zumpt. L. G. p. 241.)

</p>
<p>of this law, the fourth part only of the debt was paid, namely, an
</p>
<p>as for a sestertius, and a sestertius for a denarius ; or 25 for 100,
</p>
<p>and 250 for 1000. The sestertius was originally equal to two asses
</p>
<p>and a half ; and the denarius to ten ; when, however, the weight of
</p>
<p>the as was diminished to one ounce, a denarius passed for sixteen
</p>
<p>'asses, and a sestertius for four, which proportion continued when
</p>
<p>the as was reduced to half an ounce. Velleius Paterculus (2, 23,)
</p>
<p>speaks of the Valerian law above mentioned, in terms of merited
</p>
<p>reprobation. " Valerius Flaccus, turpissimae legis auctor, qua
</p>
<p>creditoribus quadrantem solvi jusserat." Montesquieu, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, praises this law. {V Esprit des Lois, 22, 22.) The error,

<p>by many of the learned, was finally removed from his w r ork.
</p>
<p>11. Secessit. Three secessions of the people are recorded in
</p>
<p>Roman history. The first took place A. U. C. 260, on account of
</p>
<p>the severity of creditors, and was made to the sacred mount. (Liv.
</p>
<p>2, 32.) The second was occasioned by the conduct of Appius
</p>
<p>Claudius, the decemvir, and was made first to the Aventine and
</p>
<p>afterwards to the sacred mount. (Liv. 3, 50.) It happened A. U.
</p>
<p>C. 305. The third was produced by the same cause as the first,
</p>
<p>and was made to the Janiculum, A. U. C. 466. (Liv. epit. lib. 11.)
</p>
<p>12. Nemo bonus. " No man of spirit."
</p>
<p>13. Amittit. " Parts with." The student will observe that perdit
</p>
<p>would change entirely the spirit of the passage. A mittere is simply
</p>
<p>" to lose the possession of a thing which one has once had." Per-
</p>
<p>dertj on the other hand, is " to lose," " destroy," or " throw away
</p>
<p>uselessly or hurtfully." Thus, in the treatise addressed to Heren-
</p>
<p>nius, (4, 44,) we have the following : " Quod mihi bene vxdetur
</p>
<p>Decius intellexissc, qui se devovisse dicitur, et pro legionibu-s in
</p>
<p>kostes intulisse mcdios ; unde amisit vitam, at 7ion perdidit." (Yid.
</p>
<p>Crombic's Gymnasium, vol. 1, p. 98.)
</p>
<p>14. Quonam modo, &c. " In what way we may perish, after
</p>
<p>having most effectually avenged our blood ;" i. e. how we may sell
</p>
<p>our lives as dearly as possible.
</p>
<p>15. Marcius. The verb rcspondit is elegantly understood. Thus,
</p>
<p>Phaedrus, 1,25,8, "At -Me, facer cm meherculc, mm esse scircm
</p>
<p>carnis tc cupidum meac. y} (Vid. Poland's Latin Ellipses, p. 254.)
</p>
<p>16. Optumo cuiquc. " To each most eminent person." Optumo
</p>
<p>cuiquc is here equivalent to optimatibus singulis. From a com-
</p>
<p>parison of various passages in Cicero, it would appear that optimatcSj
</p>
<p>in that writer, denote " persons distinguished by rank or political
</p>
<p>merit," and sometimes the former only. Crombie's Gymnasium,

</p>
<p>This use of non quo for ?wn quod has been very much disputed.
</p>
<p>H. Stephens (Schcdias77i. 2, 7,) and Laurentius Valla (Elcg. 2, 37.)
</p>
<p>particularly oppose it. Tursellinus, on the other hand, successfully
</p>
<p>defends its correctness, both from the language of manuscripts and
</p>
<p>the usage of the best writers. (Turs. dc Part. p. 494, ed. Lips.

</p>
<p>which is governed by dicit understood. The whole expression in

<p>the text will be equivalent to " L Catiline greets Q. Catulus," or,

</p>
<p>of the Romans, the following remarks may not be misplaced. If
</p>
<p>either of the parties was invested with an office, civil or military, it
</p>
<p>was usual to express it thus : " P. Serv. Rullus. Trib. pi. x. vir
</p>
<p>Pompeio Consult." When the person addressed was an intimate
</p>
<p>friend, they sometimes added the epithets " Humanissimus,"

</p>
<p>" Praetores Syracusani Marcello suo" The M Praeloquium" was
</p>
<p>sometimes conceived in the following terms : " Si vales, gaudeo ;

<p>ego valco" and frequently written in the initials only, S. V. G E.

<p>or " Salve," to which, in some instances, was added the expression
</p>
<p>of endearment, " Mi anime." The place where the letter was
</p>
<p>written was subjoined, unless previously communicated. The date
</p>
<p>always expressed the day, frequently the year, and sometimes the
</p>
<p>hour. They used no signature, or subscription, unless when writ-
</p>
<p>ing to emperors. There was very rarely an inscription on the out*
</p>
<p>side, the letter being delivered to a letter-carrier, (Tabellarius,) who
</p>
<p>was made acquainted with the person for whom it was intended.
</p>
<p>The letter was tied round with a string, the knot of which was
</p>
<p>sealed. The seal was, generally, a head of the letter-writer, or of
</p>
<p>some of his ancestors, impressed on wax or chalk. Hence the
</p>
<p>phrases for " to open a letter," are "vinculum solvere," "incidere
</p>
<p>linum" u epistolam solvere." It was usual also for the bearer of
</p>
<p>the letter, before it was opened, to request the person to examine

<p>2. Egregia tua fides, &c. " Your distinguished integrity, known
</p>
<p>to me by experience, has given a pleasing confidence to my present
</p>
<p>recommendation," i. e. has inspired me w T ith a pleasing confidence
</p>
<p>in recommending my concerns to your care.
</p>
<p>3. Quamobrem dcfensionem, &c. Defensio is here opposed to
</p>
<p>satisf actio, and signifies a formal defence in the presence of one's
</p>
<p>enemies, while satisfactio denotes a general explanation, such as
</p>
<p>may satisfy a friend. The whole passage may hence be rendered
</p>
<p>35 follows : " Wherefore, as regards the novel step which I have
</p>
<p>256 NOTES TO THE
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>QY taken, I have resolved not to prepare a formal defence of it against
</p>
<p>my enemies, but, without any consciousness of misconduct, have
</p>
<p>determined to lay before you such an explanation as may remove
</p>
<p>the doubts of a friend." The phrase " ex nulla conscientia de
</p>
<p>culpa," Burnouf considers a remnant of earlier Latinity, when the
</p>
<p>preposition, as in our modern tongues, was used to identify indi-
</p>
<p>vidual cases, de culpa being here equivalent to culpae. We doubt
</p>
<p>the correctness of this explanation. The preposition appears to be
</p>
<p>here used with the ablative for the purpose of expressing the
</p>
<p>slightest possible relation between conscientia and culpa in the mind
</p>
<p>of the writer.
</p>
<p>4. Quam. Referring to satisf actionem.
</p>
<p>5. Me dius fidius, &c. " Which, upon my honour as a man,
</p>
<p>you will find to be true." As regards the expression dirts fidius,
</p>
<p>Festus makes it the same as Aios filius, " the son of Jove," i. e.
</p>
<p>Hercules. He states, at the same time, two other explanations ;
</p>
<p>one, which makes it equivalent to divi fides, and the other to diei
</p>
<p>fides. All these etymologies are decidedly erroneous. A passage
</p>
<p>in Plautus, (Asin. 1, 1, 8,) furnishes a safer guide. It is as follows :
</p>
<p>"Per deum fidium quaeris ; jurato mthi video necesse esse eloqui,
</p>
<p>quidquid roges." From this passage we may fairly infer, that, in
</p>
<p>the phrase under consideration, dius is the same as detis or divus,
</p>
<p>&n& fidius an adjective formed from fides. Hence dius fidius, "the
</p>
<p>god of honour," or " good faith," will be the same as the Zcvj
</p>
<p>riartos of the Greeks ; and, if we follow the authority of Varro, (L. L.
</p>
<p>4, 10,) identical with the Sabine Sancus, and Roman Hercules : so
</p>
<p>that me dius fidius is nothing more than me dais fidei (i. e. Hercules)
</p>
<p>adjuvet, or, in other words, mehcrcule.
</p>
<p>6. Fructu laboris. Alluding to the consulship, which he had
</p>
<p>sought ineffectually.
</p>
<p>7. Statum dignitatis. "That station in the republic to which I
</p>
<p>was fairly entitled." Compare ch. 18, " Post paullo Caiilina, pecu-

</p>
<p>8. Mcis nominibus. " Of my own contracting."  Alienis nomi-
</p>
<p>nibus. " Contracted by others, and for which I had become surety."
</p>
<p>Among the Romans, it was a customary formality, in borrowing
</p>
<p>money, to write down the sum and subscribe the person's name in
</p>
<p>the banker's books. Hence nomen is put for a debt, for the cause
</p>
<p>of a debt, for an article of account, &c.

</p>
<p>through groundless suspicion."

</p>
<p>11. Hoc nomine, &c. " On this account I have pursued a course 0*7
</p>
<p>sufficiently honourable, considering my calamitous situation, and
</p>
<p>one which leads me to entertain the hope of preserving what con-
</p>
<p>sideration there is left me."
</p>
<p>12. Earn ab injuria defendas, &c. " Defend her from injury,
</p>
<p>being intreated so to do by the love you bear to your own off-
</p>
<p>spring."
</p>
<p>13. Haveto. An archaism for Aveto. Catullus uses this form
</p>
<p>(101, 10,) "Have atque Vale: 1 Compare Quintilian, 1, 6, 21, ed.
</p>
<p>Spalding. Winter's etymology of the word is extremely ingenious :
</p>
<p>" Have or Ave is nothing but Habe, have, possess  riches, honours,
</p>
<p>health."
</p>
<p>14. In agro Arretino. The common text has Reatino. As
</p>
<p>Reate, however, was a town of the Sabines, and as Catiline was
</p>
<p>proceeding along the Aurelian way, under the pretence of retiring to
</p>
<p>Massilia, but in reality to join Manlius, it is far preferable to adopt
</p>
<p>Arretino as the lection, Arretium (now Arezzo) being an ancient
</p>
<p>city of Etruria.
</p>
<p>15. Sine fraude. " With impunity," or " with the assurance of
</p>
<p>safety." Compare the words of Ulpian, {leg. 131, de V. S.) " Aliud
</p>
<p>fraus est, aliud poena. Fraus enim sine poena esse potest : poena
</p>
<p>sine fraude esse non potest. Poena est noxae vindicta; fraus et
</p>
<p>ipsa noxa dicitur, et quasi poenae quaedam p-aeparatio."
</p>
<p>] 6. Praeter condemnatis . In this clause, condemnatis
</p>
<p>depends on liceret, and praeter is used adverbially for praeterquam.
</p>
<p>The instances, however, of such a usage are not of very frequent
</p>
<p>occurrence. We have one in Justin, (13, 5,) " Alexander epistolas
</p>
<p>in Graeciam scripserat, quibus omnium civitatum exules, praeter
</p>
<p>caedis damnati, restituebantur." {Vid. Graev. ad loc.) Another
</p>
<p>example is found in Suetonius, though not so conclusive as the first :
</p>
<p>"reliquerit cum nullo, praeter auguralis sacerdotii, honore imperti-
</p>
<p>tum." {Claud. 4.  vol. 2, page 10. ed. Crus.)

<p>the senate." Though two decrees of the senate had been made.
</p>
<p>There is here an ellipsis offactis. The first of these ordinances is

</p>
<p>minds of so large a number, and produced a disaffection to the

</p>
<p>their own, look with an evil eye on the higher class of citizens,
</p>
<p>elevate to office those who are of the same stamp with themselves."
</p>
<p>Quis is put for quibus. By bonos are here meant, not the good and
</p>
<p>virtuous merely, but, generally speaking, the better class of citizens,
</p>
<p>who are always more or less averse to violent changes in the state,
</p>
<p>as well from principle, as from the danger which might result to
</p>
<p>their private affairs. By malos, on the other hand, are meant the
</p>
<p>needy and unprincipled. Compare Plautus, (Captiv. 3, 4, 51,)
</p>
<p>" Est miserorum ut malevolentes sint atqut invideant bonis."
</p>
<p>4. Turba. u By public disturbance."  Sine euro. u Without
</p>
<p>any apprehension for themselves."  Habetur. " Is kept," or
</p>
<p>" exists." The idea expressed in the text, when paraphrased, will
</p>
<p>be, " since poverty does not easily suffer loss."
</p>
<p>5. Plcbes. To be construed as the nominative absolute. Some edi-
</p>
<p>tions read a vcro, instead of ea vcro, removing at the same time the
</p>
<p>comma after plcbes, which of course alters the construction. This
</p>
<p>emendation, however, is far inferior to the reading in our text. From
</p>
<p>a view of the context it will appear, that Sallust first speaks of the
</p>
<p>people in general, the people of the whole empire, (cuncta plcbes
</p>
<p>omnino. ) He then particularizes the people of the capital, and remarks,
</p>
<p>that, with regard to them, there were other and more special reasons,

<p>the operation of which led thein to favour the designs of Catiline.

<p>10. Privatis atquc publicis larg-itiojiibus. The private largesses

<p>were bestowed either by the candidates for public favour, or by

<p>those who had already enjoyed it : the public have reference to the

</p>
<p>Lepidus, as given by Sallust, (Hist. frag. lib. 1, p. 936, ed. Cart.)
</p>
<p>About twenty years after this event, a powerful effort was made by
</p>
<p>the individuals who were suffering under the operation of this law,
</p>
<p>to have it repealed. Cicero was at that time consul, and by his
</p>
<p>strenuous exertions defeated the application. Of the oration de-
</p>
<p>livered by him on this occasion, (De proscriptorum liberis,) a
</p>
<p>solitary fragment is preserved by Quintilian, (11, 1,) " Quid enim
</p>
<p>crudelius quam homines honestis parentibus ac majoribus natos a
</p>
<p>republica submoveri 1 Sed ita legibus Syllae continetur status
</p>
<p>civitatis, ut, his solutis, stare ipsa non possit." (Cic. Op. ed
</p>
<p>Olivet, vol. 6, p. 479.) Cicero himself alludes to his conduct in
</p>
<p>this affair, in his oration against Piso, (chap. 2.) He allowed the
</p>
<p>claim to be perfectly reasonable, but argued against it on the ground
</p>
<p>of state-policy. Julius Caesar, however, subsequently abrogated
</p>
<p>this unjust ordinance. Thus Suetonius, (Jul. 41,) remarks, " Ad-

<p>15. Tribunicia potestas restituta. The tribunes of the commons
</p>
<p>were originally created A. U. C. 260, at the time of the secession
</p>
<p>to the sacred mount, for the purpose of protecting the rights of the
</p>
<p>people. Under the sanction, however, of the law which made their
</p>
<p>persons sacred, they subsequently carried their power to the most
</p>
<p>extravagant height. Sylla abridged, and in a manner extinguished,
</p>
<p>that power, by enacting, that whoever had been tribune should not
</p>
<p>260 NOTES TO THE

</p>
<p>Qg afterwards enjoy any other magistracy ; that there should be no
</p>
<p>appeal to the tribunes ; that they should not be allowed to assemble
</p>
<p>the people and make harangues to them, nor propose laws, but
</p>
<p>should only retain the right of intercession. In the consulship of
</p>
<p>Cotta, however, (A. U. C. 679,) they again obtained the right of
</p>
<p>enjoying other offices ; and in that of Pompey and Crassus, A. U.
</p>
<p>C. 683, all their former powers. Pompey 's conduct in this affair is
</p>
<p>very justly condemned by Cicero, since the tribunes now became
</p>
<p>mere tools in the hands of the ambitious and powerful.
</p>
<p>16. Summam potestatcm nacti. These words have very much
</p>
<p>the appearance of an interpolation. They are not necessary to the
</p>
<p>sense, since by summam. potestatcm is meant the tribunician power,
</p>
<p>which has already been mentioned in the preceding clause.

</p>
<p>ported by Mithridates, called also the piratical war. The Cilician
</p>
<p>pirates, covered even' sea with their fleets, and extended their dep-
</p>
<p>redations even to the coast of Italy and the mouth of the Tiber.
</p>
<p>Pompey was sent against them, by virtue of the Gabinian law, A.
</p>
<p>U. C. 687, and brought the war to a conclusion within the space of

<p>9. Placidius. "More peaceably." The meaning of the clause 99
</p>
<p>is, that those who rilled offices of magistracy, especially the tri-
</p>
<p>buneship, might be less disposed to stir up commotions among
</p>
<p>the people, through dread of prosecution by the nobility, after the
</p>
<p>expiration of their offices.
</p>
<p>10. Ubi primum, &c. Gruter suggests novandi, which Cortius
</p>
<p>acknowledges would make an easier construction, though it would
</p>
<p>be less in accordance with the style of Sallust, than the present
</p>
<p>reading novandis. Some editions adopt Grater's suggestion of
</p>
<p>novandi, and place a comma after primum, and another after rebus.
</p>
<p>We have given the reading of Cortius, which may be rendered as
</p>
<p>follows : "As soon as the hope was presented to their view of
</p>
<p>effecting some change in the adverse condition of their affairs."

<p>15. A. Fulvius. As Valerius Maximus, (5, 8, 5,) in mentioning
</p>
<p>this same circumstance, calls the name of the father A. Fulvius,
</p>
<p>Cortius thinks it probable that Sallust wrote A. Fulvii senatoris
</p>
<p>Jilius. Dio Cassius (37, 36) incorrectly makes the son himself a

<p>senator : ' AvAov SI ^ouA/ftioi/, avSpa fiov\cvTi]v } avros b izarfip d-rreff^a^ev,

<p>ception;" "to have an idea" or "notion of it, as apprehended by
</p>
<p>the mind." Scire is " to know any thing as a matter of fact, or
</p>
<p>any truth as an object of conviction." The following examples will

</p>
<p>QCJ explain this difference more fully : " Hominem novi, et dominus qui
</p>
<p>nunc est scio." (Plant. Rud. 4, 3, 26,) "I am acquainted with
</p>
<p>the man, and I know who his master is." The latter clause, how
</p>
<p>ever, does not imply any personal knowledge of the master. He
</p>
<p>might know him only by name. " Non norunt, scio.'' 1 (Plaut. Cos.
</p>
<p>Prol.) " They are not acquainted with the play," not having seen
</p>
<p>it performed  " this circumstance I know." (Crombie's Gymna-
</p>
<p>sium, vol. 1, p. 82.)
</p>
<p>19. Pcrcunctatus. Percunctari (or percontari) means " to sift
</p>
<p>to the bottom by search or inquiry," M tD pry," and has, according
</p>
<p>to Dumesnil, a relation very often to public news. It is derived
</p>
<p>probably from per and contus, (quasi per contum exquirere,) and ex-
</p>
<p>presses a sifting and inquisitive manner of asking. Percunctari,
</p>
<p>moreover, answers to the Greek TrwddveaBat, and always requires a
</p>
<p>detailed reply.
</p>
<p>100 I* Videt. This verb is here used instead of audit. Compare
</p>
<p>Cicero, {pro Arch. 8,) " Quoties ego hunc Archiam vidi
</p>
<p>dicer e ex tempore."
</p>
<p>2. Si modo, &c. " Provided only you are inclined to act the
</p>
<p>part of men. 91
</p>
<p>3. Quin. In the sense of quod non, which is the reading of some
</p>
<p>editions.
</p>
<p>4. Ab Roma aberat. This is one of the examples which Priscian
</p>
<p>adduces, for the purpose of showing, that the preposition is often,
</p>
<p>more especially by historians, added to the ablative of names of
</p>
<p>places.
</p>
<p>5. Quo major auctoritas, &c. " That what he should say might
</p>
<p>have greater weight."
</p>
<p>6. Innoxios. " Innocent persons ;" i. e. individuals unconnected
</p>
<p>with the conspiracy. The adjective is here used in what the gram-
</p>
<p>marians call an active sense. Compare note 7, page 99.  Quo

<p>inspired with more courage to act."
</p>
<p>7. Majorca opes. " More powerful resource^;" those namely
</p>
<p>of the republic. Dureau de Lamalle renders the phrase by H uno
</p>
<p>grande masse de puissance."
</p>
<p>8. Patrocinio. Individual noblemen, or particular families of
</p>
<p>illustrious rank, were sometimes patrons of whole states. These
</p>
<p>patrons were generally those who had reduced them under the Ro-
</p>
<p>man power, or had, at some time or other, been appointed governors
</p>
<p>over them : and the rights of patronage were transmitted by them to
</p>
<p>their descendants. In the present instance, Q. Fabius Sanga derived
</p>
<p>his right of patronage from his ancestor Q. Fabius Maximus, who
</p>

</p>
<p>finally reduced the Allobroges, and hence was surnamed Allobro- 1 00
</p>
<p>gicus.
</p>
<p>9. Consilio cognito. " Having learned the plot."  Studium con-
</p>
<p>jurationis, &c. " To feign a strong desire for the success of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy."
</p>
<p>10. Bene polliceantur. " To promise fair." Bene is here equiv-
</p>
<p>alent to bona quaeque.
</p>
<p>11. Gallia citeriore. Hither or Cisalpine Gaul, lying south of
</p>
<p>the Alps, and forming the northern division of Italy. The term
</p>
<p>citerior is applied in reference to Rome.
</p>
<p>12. Cuncta simul agcre. " Put all their schemes in operation at
</p>
<p>one and the same moment." Cortius wishes to exclude cuncta simul
</p>
<p>from the text, in opposition to all the manuscripts.
</p>
<p>13. Festinando, agitando omnia. " By their precipitate move-
</p>
<p>ments, by their throwing all things into confusion."
</p>
<p>1. C. Murena. Brother of Licinius Murena, consul elect. The iai
</p>
<p>common reading in citeriore Gallia has been amended by Cortius,
</p>
<p>and in ultcriorc Gallia substituted. There can be no doubt what-
</p>
<p>ever as to the correctness of this alteration. Celer was in hither
</p>
<p>Gaul, and Murena, as appears plainly from Cicero, {pro Murena, 41,)
</p>
<p>was in Transalpine or farther Gaul.
</p>
<p>2. Legatus. A proconsul or propraetor chose a legatus to ac-
</p>
<p>company him to his province, and assist him in the discharge of his
</p>
<p>public duties. Thus Cicero, for example, when he went as pro-
</p>
<p>consul into Cilicia, A. U. C 702, chose for his legatus his brother
</p>
<p>Quintus. In the absence of the governor of the province, the
</p>
<p>legatus exercised full control over it, and had equal authority and
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. Sometimes the governor remained at home, and
</p>
<p>merely sent out the legatus to the province ; and at other times
</p>
<p>the senate, without naming any proconsul or propraetor, merely
</p>
<p>sent, out a legatus. This last was the case with C Murena.
</p>
<p>3. Vidcbantur. Understand iliac, referring to copiae.

<p>4. Conscitucrant. The verb is put in the plural, as if Lent ulus

<p>5. Actionibus. " The proceedings," " the acts." Alluding to
</p>
<p>Cicero's having driven Catiline from the city, and excited, as they
</p>
<p>maintained, the most groundless suspicions against many innocent
</p>
<p>individuals. Compare Appian, (B. C. 2, 3,) Acvkiov Si Bio-nap,

<p>101 a ^ ew ^ s De f re that of Cicero expired, would not suffer him to
</p>
<p>address the people. They placed their own benches on the rostra,
</p>
<p>and only gave him permission to take the oath upon laying
</p>
<p>down his office, after which he was immediately to descend. Ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, when Cicero went up, it was expected that he would
</p>
<p>take the customary oath ; but, silence being made, instead of the
</p>
<p>usual form, he adopted one that was new and singular. The pur-
</p>
<p>port of it was, that " He had saved his country, and preserved the
</p>
<p>empire :" (] p/v ocouiKtvat rfjv Trarp'tda, ical 6iartrriprjKivat. rfjv t)yc^oviav.)

</p>
<p>regarded this expression on the part of the historian as extremely
</p>
<p>honourable, considering the private feud which existed between him
</p>
<p>and Cicero. We should be inclined to put a different construction
</p>
<p>upon it. Nothing appears to us more frigid than this language of
</p>
<p>Sallust respecting one who had been the preserver of his country.
</p>
<p>And that it would sound so in fact to a Roman ear, may be c!
</p>
<p>inferred from a passage in one of the letters of Cicero to Atticus,
</p>
<p>(12, 21.) in which he speaks of Brutus having applied this same
</p>
<p>expression to him : "Hie autcm se cliam tnbuere multum mihi
</p>
<p>putatj quod scripscrit optimum consulcm. Quis cnim jejumus dint

</p>
<p>7. Proruma noctc. Plutarch states, that one of the nights of the
</p>
<p>Saturnalia had been fixed for the perpetration of the horrid d
</p>
<p>mentioned in the text. The I of Cicero is to the same
</p>
<p>effect, (3, in CaL 4 ) The celebration of the Saturnalia commenced
</p>
<p>on the 17th day of December, so that Bestia was to have delivered
</p>
<p>his intended harangue a few days after he had entered upon his
</p>
<p>office, which, in the case of the tribunes, was the 10th of the same
</p>
<p>month. On the 5th of December, however, the conspirators were
</p>
<p>put to death.

<p>from that of Sallust. He informs us that the conspirators had

<p>divided Rome into a hundred parts, and selected the same number
</p>
<p>of men, to each of whom was allotted his quarter to be set on fire.
</p>
<p>As this was to be done by them all at the same moment, they

<p>hoped that the conflagration would be general. Other-

</p>
<p>fulgent purpura" &c.

<p>12. Parata. Plutarch states, that Caius Sulpicius, one of the
</p>
<p>praetors, who had been sent to Cethegus's house, found there a
</p>
<p>large quantity of javelins, swords, poniards, and other arms, all newly-

<p>be misplaced. Convenire in urbem. " To come into the city and
</p>
<p>assemble." Convenire in urbe. u To assemble in the city, having
</p>
<p>been there before." Convenire aliquem. " To speak to anyone,"
</p>
<p>or M to have an interview with him." Convenit hoc mihi. "This
</p>
<p>suits me," or, " is convenient to me." Convenit mihi cum illo. " I
</p>
<p>agree with him."
</p>
<p>15. Jusjurandum. " An oath :" i. e. a written promise in the
</p>
<p>language and form of an oath, that the conspirators would afford
</p>
<p>relief to the Allobroges, if the latter joined in the plot and it should

</p>
<p>it may not be amiss to state that Cicero gives it somewhat differ-
</p>
<p>ently, (3, in Cat. 5.) It is more than probable, however, that the
</p>
<p>orator merely stated the purport of it from memory, while Sallust

</p>
<p>This may all very well t> thfl presence of cito in the text,

<p>at an exorbitant price ; which Tarquin refusing, she burnt three of

<p>them, still demanding the same price for the remaining six. Being

<p>conduct, consulted the augurs, who, regretting the loss of the books

<p>7. Urlns potiri. The verb potiri, which elsewhere governs an
</p>
<p>ablative, is often, as in the present instance, used with a genitive.
</p>
<p>This government, however, admits of a very easy explanation, if we
</p>
<p>consider that potiri is m fact equivalent to potcns esse or poterUem
</p>
<p>esse. In Plautus we even find the active of this verb. (Amph. I,
</p>
<p>1, 23,) " Qui fucrim liber, eum nunc potimt pater servitutis ;" i. e.
</p>
<p>"has put in ft] has made partaker of slavery;" thence

</p>
<p>curule. Two plebeian aediles were first created, A. U. C. 260, in 103
</p>
<p>the Comitia Curiata, at the same time with the tribunes of the
</p>
<p>commons, to be, as it were, their assistants, and to determine cer-
</p>
<p>tain minor causes, which the tribunes committed to them. The
</p>
<p>were afterwards created, as the other inferior magistrates, at tho
</p>
<p>Comitia Tributa. Two curule aediles were created from the
</p>
<p>patricians, A. U. C. 387, to perform certain public games. They
</p>
<p>were first chosen alternately from the patricians and plebeians, but
</p>
<p>afterwards promiscuously from both. They wore the toga practexta,
</p>
<p>had the right of images, and a more honourable place of giving their
</p>
<p>opinion in the senate. They also used the sella curulis, whence
</p>
<p>their name of curule aediles. As a counterbalance for all this,
</p>
<p>however, the persons of the plebeian aediles were sacred, like those
</p>
<p>of the tribunes. The general office of the aediles was to take care
</p>
<p>of the city, (hence their name a cura aedium,) to regulate the
</p>
<p>markets, inspect the weights and measures, &c.

</p>
<p>of being themselves concerned in the plot. By pretending to re-
</p>
<p>gard them as good and faithful citizens, the senate drove them to

<p>the necessity of assuming that character at least.

</p>
<p>third inline. In this he gave an account of the arrest of the
</p>
<p>Allobroges, and the transactions in the senate. The people then
</p>
<p>perceived the full extent of the danger from which they had just been
</p>
<p>mce of then* consul, and gave him
</p>
<p>the full meed of applause which he so richly deserved.

<p>Suetonius (Vit. Cats. 17) informs us, that Caesar was named as

</p>
<p>Vettius before Novius Nigrus the quaestor, (or, perhaps, public

</p>
<p>informs us, that when Metellu3, the chief pontiff, died, the office
</p>
<p>was solicited by Isauricus and Catulus, two of the most illustrious
</p>
<p>men in the city, and of the greatest interest in the senate. Caesar,
</p>
<p>id not shrink from the contest, but presented himself
</p>
<p>to the people as a candidate. The pretensions and prospects of the
</p>
<p>competitors seemed nearly equal ; and Catulus, who, on account of
</p>
<p>his superior dignitv, was most uneasy about the event, sent privately
</p>
<p>to Caesar, and offered him lame RIIB0, on condition that he would
</p>
<p>desist from his high pursuit. But he answered, " He would rather

<p>20. Adolcscentulo. " A mere youth when compared with him-

<p>self." As Caesar was at this time thirty-seven years of age, it is
</p>
<p>evident the term adolcsccntulus is merely applied to him compara-
</p>
<p>tively, in reference to the advanced age of Catulus.

<p>ments, he far outshone the most ambitious that had gone before

<p>him. Suetonius even states, that the number of gladiators just

<p>mentioned was less than he had originally intended, owing to the
</p>
<p>envy and opposition of his enemies. Caesar is said by Plutarch to
</p>
<p>have been thirteen hundred talents in debt before he obtained any
</p>
<p>public employment. This would amount in sterling money to
</p>
<p>251,875. When he set out for Spain, after his praetorship, he is

<p>and brought into it, at the end of the civil war, above 4,843,750.

<p>for not having availed himself of so good an opportunity as he then

<p>had, and for having been influenced by his fears of the people, who

</p>
<p>(Vit. Caes. 14) informs us, that some of the knights threatened
</p>
<p>Caesar as he sat in the senate-house. It is probable that he and
</p>
<p>Sallust allude to different meetings.

<p>4. Mimtarcntur. The frequentative appears to be used in this

<p>passage, not so much for the sake of better sound, as in order to
</p>
<p>express the idea of a frequent brandishing of the sword, though it
</p>
<p>cannot be well conveyed in an English translation.
</p>
<p>5. Libcrti. The Romans used the term libcrtus when they spoke
</p>
<p>of the master ; as, libcrtus Lentuli ; but Ubcrtinus, in relation to
</p>
<p>free-born citizens, as, Ubcrtinus homo, i. e. non inoenuus.
</p>
<p>6. Yicis. 4i The streets." Vicus, properly speaking, refers to
</p>
<p>the appearance presented by the buildings in a street ; a row of
</p>
<p>houses resembling, as it were, a single and extensive edifice.
</p>
<p>(o?<oc, and, with the digamma, FoiVo*, whence vicus.) The term is
</p>
<p>used here, however, in the sense of via.
</p>
<p>7. Eripicndum. Understand c custodia. Cicero (4, in Cat. 8)
</p>
<p>states, that none were found who would engage in such an attempt.
</p>
<p>Appian, however, informs us, that on the nones of December, while
</p>
<p>the senate were deliberating about the punishment of the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors, the slaves and freedmen of Lentulus and Cethegus, and a
</p>
<p>large body of working people, assailed the habitations of the praetors
</p>
<p>in the rear, and endeavoured to rescue the prisoners. Cicero, upon
</p>
<p>learning this, immediately left the senate, and planted guards in
</p>
<p>suitable quarters of the city, after which he returned and expedited
</p>
<p>the debate. (Appian, B. C. 2, 5.)

</p>
<p>were unsuccessful, and a large majority of the senators, and among
</p>
<p>them Cicero's own brother, Quintus, were disposed to side with

<p>Caesar, probably from the fear lest severer measures might prove

<p>Caesar's inveterate foe, and Cato, who was then tribune of the com-

</p>
<p>proved triumphant, and the course he recommended was almost

<p>decree of the senate was commonly made by a separation of the

</p>
<p>" Let those who are of such an opinion pass over to that side,"

</p>
<p>15. Sed Caesar. The speech which Sallust here assigns to
</p>
<p>Caesar, and which, from the term hujusccmodi, as used by the his-
</p>
<p>torian, must be regarded as Caesar's merely in its general and
</p>
<p>leading features, is a perfect masterpiece of its kind : cool, argu-
</p>
<p>mentative, specious, and breathing apparently a spirit of patriotism,
</p>
<p>which was calculated to carry with it the opinions and feelings of a
</p>
<p>large majority of his hearers. It required all the bold and fervid
</p>
<p>eloquence of Cato to counteract its pernicious tendency.
</p>
<p>16. Ab odio, amicitia y &c. This construction of vacuus with
</p>
<p>the preposition, is not unusual in the best writers, such as Cicero,
</p>
<p>Tacitus, &c. Compare, in the 14th chapter of this same narrative,
</p>
<p>a culpa vacuus.
</p>
<p>17. Lubidini simul ct usui paruit. " Has obeyed at the same
</p>
<p>time the dictates of passion and of interest."
</p>
<p>18. Ubi intcndens mgtmum, &c. Understand in vcrum after
</p>
<p>imrenium. The passage may be paraphrased as follows : "When
</p>
<p>you apply the mind to the discovery of truth, unbiased by the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of any of these feelings, it succeeds in the search : if passion
</p>
<p>hold possession, it rules, and reason becomes useless."
</p>
<p>1. Bella Maccdonico. Brought to a conclusion by Paulus ia/j
</p>
<p>Aemilius, after the famous battle of Pydna, A. U. C. 686. " Qui

</p>

<p>Cato the elder delivered in their behalf.

<p>accomplish this by showing that such eloquence is entirely super-
</p>
<p>fluous, as the crime speaks for itself, and cannot be aggravated by
</p>
<p>any powers of description. The true course for the senate to pursue
</p>
<p>is, according to him, to guard against any undue severity of punish-
</p>
<p>ment, both because it may expose them to the animadversion of
</p>
<p>posteritv, and may furnish those coming after them with a danger-
</p>
<p>ous precedent. Hence he artfully urges the propriety of lenient
</p>
<p>measures.

<p>5. Ultra. " After this ;" i. e. beyond the grave. The doctrine
</p>
<p>advocated by Caesar in the text, and which corresponded so inti-
</p>
<p> lv with his life and actions, was one unhappily but too preva-
</p>
<p>lent in the ancient world. Cicero makes mention of this opinion of
</p>
<p>Caesar with regard to the soul, in his fourth oration against Cati-
</p>
<p>line ; and Cato also alludes to it in the following speech.

<p>and then refers to the vigilance of the magistrate in marking offences 1 QQ
</p>
<p>committed. In this case there is often an application of the prepo-
</p>

<p>more strongly the steady attention directed towards the conduct

<p>found to be reprehensible. Hill's Synonyms, p. 89.
</p>
<p>7. Hanc ego caussam, &c. The train of reasoning which is here
</p>
<p>ascribed by the historian to Caesar, would appear to be as follows :
</p>
<p>Our forefathers, though they wanted neither sagacity in devising
</p>
<p>plans for their own advantage, nor boldness in carrying those plans
</p>
<p>into operation, yet never disdained to imitate, in the institutions of
</p>
<p>other nations, what they conceived to be of utility to themselves.
</p>
<p>Among other things, they borrowed the custom of inflicting capital
</p>
<p>punishment on condemned citizens. As. however, thev had adopted
</p>
<p>this from the Greeks at a period when it promised to be productive
</p>
<p>of salutary effects, so they changed it for a different course when
</p>
<p>positive evil was found to result. This was their latest alteration,
</p>
<p>and it being such, we, their descendants, should be guided in this
</p>
<p>instance by their wisdom, and pursue without any deviation the path
</p>
<p>they have marked out for us, the more especially, as we acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge our inferiority to them in political foresight, and in the princi-
</p>
<p>ples of sound government.

<p>1 10 wou ld have been altogether out of place in so bold and animated
</p>
<p>an harangue.
</p>
<p>5. Habere. " Inhabit." Used in the sense of habitare. Com-
</p>
<p>pare Cicero, Tusc. 1, 30.
</p>
<p>6. Videlicet timens. " Fearing, to be sure.*' Strong irony is
</p>
<p>expressed by both of these terms, but especially by the latter, since
</p>
<p>Caesar was more than suspected of being implicated in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy.
</p>
<p>7. Multitudine coiulueta. " By a hired mob." With eanducta
</p>
<p>understand pretio or merccde ; and compare note 8, page 105.
</p>
<p>8. Quare vanum eguidem, &c. " Wherefore this advice is idle
</p>
<p>indeed, if he actually apprehends danger from them : while on the
</p>
<p>other hand, if, amid the great alarm which pervades all classes, he
</p>
<p>alone feels none, on that very account it concerns me to fear the
</p>
<p>more for myself, and you for yourselves." The expression w<yw
</p>
<p>rcfcrt, mihij &c is equivalent to maQis refer t me mihi, vosque I
</p>
<p>tunere. Cato here alludes in pointed terms to Caesar's supposed
</p>
<p>connexion with the c<
</p>
<p>9. Quanto vos attcn "The more vigorously ye
</p>
<p>shall act on the present occasion.
</p>
<p>10 Armis. " By arms alone." Understand tantum or modo.
</p>
<p>11. Quae nobis ?iul! None of which we have." Which
</p>
<p>have no existence for us.
</p>
<p>L3. A7iinus in consulendn lif>< A mind unfettered in

</p>
<p>as Dahl supplies the ellipsis.

<p>2. Supra caput est A figurative expression, analogous to the
</p>
<p>English phrases, "is at our very doors," or, M has the sword at our
</p>
<p>Jiroats."
</p>
<p>3. Adprehensis hostibus. The dative, not the ablative. Com-
</p>
<p>pare Cicero, Acad. 4, 115, " Diodoro quid faciam StotcoV and
</p>
<p>Pro Caecin. 30, H Quid hue tu homini facias ?" The common
</p>
<p>editions of Sallust have deprchensis, but the reading we have c
</p>
<p>is more significant. Deprehendere is to come upon one unawaree,
</p>
<p>but apprchendere is to seize, to lay hands upon.

<p>4 Miscreamini censeo. Uttered ironically. " My advice is that \\\
</p>
<p>you take pity on them."
</p>
<p>5. Ne, ista vobis, &c. " Yes, that clemency and compassion,
</p>
<p>should they take up arms, will change into misery for you." Ne is
</p>
<p>an archaism for nae, from the Greek vai. Ista denotes strong con-
</p>
<p>tempt. With vcrtet understand sc.
</p>
<p>C. Scilicet res aspera est, &c. " The crisis is undoubtedly a
</p>
<p>dangerous one, but you fear it not : nay, indeed, you do fear it very
</p>
<p>greatly, but," &c. After immo vero maxume, understand earn
</p>
<p>timetis. The idea intended to be conveyed is this : You will
</p>
<p>acknowledge, very probably, that the present posture of our affairs
</p>
<p>is a dangerous one, but you will assert, at the same time, that it fills
</p>
<p>you with no alarm. Your assertion is a false one ; for the condition
</p>
<p>of the state does inspire you with apprehensions, and those, too, of
</p>
<p>the strongest kind, but you are too spiritless, too slothful, to act the
</p>
<p>part that becomes you.
</p>
<p>7. Suppliciis muliebribus. " Womanish supplications."
</p>
<p>8. Prospera. Some editions have prosperc, which is inferior in
</p>
<p>point of elegance. Prospera is used adverbially here by a Hel-
</p>
<p>lenism.
</p>
<p>9. Bcllo Gallico. This is an historical error on the part of Sal-
</p>
<p>hibt. The occurrence mentioned in the text took place in a war
</p>
<p>with the Latins. Compare Florus, 1, 14, and Livy, 8, 7.
</p>
<p>10. Pucnas dedit. " Atoned with his life for his intemperate
</p>
<p>valour."'
</p>
<p>11. Vos de crudclissumis, &c. An instance of the argument a
</p>
<p>fortiori. The premises are Apud majorcs nostros, &c. If a father
</p>
<p>put to death lus own son for merely disobeying a military order,
</p>
<p>thougli that veiy act of disobedience enabled the latter to destroy
</p>
<p>one of the of his country, should their country hesitate to

<p>and parricidal spirit, have attempted to plunge the steel into her

</p>
<p>stands in direct opposition to this crime. Well then, spare the rank
</p>
<p>of Lentulus," &c. Strong irony.
</p>
<p>13. Nisi itcrum, &c. "Unless this be the second time that he
</p>
<p>has made war upon his country." The irony of adolescentiae is
</p>
<p>extremely severe. Some commentators suppose, that the allusion in
</p>
<p>the text is to his having taken part with Marius in the contest be-
</p>
<p>tween him and Sylla. It is more probable, however, that the orator
</p>
<p>is made to refer to the conspiracy of Piso, mentioned in chapter 18
</p>
<p>of this work.

</p>
<p>cised the least reflection ;" i. e. if they had not always been rash
</p>
<p>and inconsiderate in their actions. The irony is still continued : It
</p>
<p>was not from any hostile intent that they harboured these designs
</p>
<p>against their country. Oh ! no ; but from mere want of reflection.
</p>
<p>Their conduct has always been marked by inconsiderateness and
</p>
<p>haste.
</p>
<p>15. Neque parari, &c. Cato here hints that some of the senators
</p>
<p>were implicated, and betrayed the deliberations of the senate to the

<p>conspirators.

</p>
<p>3. Sicuti tile ccnsueral. The decree of the senate is said to
</p>
<p>have been made in accordance with the opinion of Cato, not because
</p>
<p>he was the only one who spoke in favour of capital punishment, but
</p>
<p>because he advocated that measure with the most ability and zeal.
</p>
<p>Thus Cicero (Ep. I remarks, " Cur ergo in senten-

</p>
<p>8. Genus. " Birth/' M. Porcius Cato, called, after his death, J J 2
</p>
<p>Uticensis, from the city of Utica, near Carthage, where he
</p>
<p>ended his existence, was the great grandson of M. Porcius Cato,
</p>
<p>the censor. The Porcian gens was plebeian ; the Julian, patrician ;
</p>
<p>illustrious achievements, however, and public honours, had raised
</p>
<p>the former to a full equality with the latter.
</p>
<p>9. Actas. At the time c r this conspiracy, Cato was thirty-three
</p>
<p>years of age, Caesar about thirty-seven.
</p>
<p>10. Gloria. Understand par
</p>
<p>11. Alia alii. " One kind of glory to the one, another to the
</p>
<p>other." The student will observe the use of alia alii in place of
</p>
<p>altera altcri, which last would be too limited in signification for the
</p>
<p>spirit of the passage. Compare Livy, 1, 21, M lta duo deinceps
</p>
<p>reges, alius alia via, Ule hello, hie pace, ctvttatem auxerunt.'*
</p>
<p>12. Huic scrcritas. M To the latter the rigid practice of virtue
</p>
<p>had imparted additional dignity."
</p>
<p>13. Ignoscendo. u By forgiving." Igjiosco properly means to
</p>
<p>take no notice of a fault, {non nosse.) Thus Cicero, (Ep. ad Brut.

<p>15, a J?ied.) " A 1 1 pocnam praetermittere {id cnim est quod

<p>tlvai xpnvrfi.  M The parallel drawn between Cato and Caesar,"
</p>
<p>observes Mr. Dunlop, " is one of the most celebrated passages in
</p>
<p>the history of the conspiracy. Of both these famed opponents we
</p>
<p>are presented with favourable likenesses. Their defects are thrown
</p>
<p>into the shade : and the bright qualities of each different species, by
</p>
<p>which they were distinguished, are contrasted for the purpose of
</p>
<p>showing the various qualities by which men arrive at eminence."
</p>
<p>Dunlop s Roman Literature, vol. 2, p. 160, Lond. ed. Steele has
</p>
<p>given an imitation of this passage of Sallust, in the Christian Hero,
</p>
<p>p. 4. Compare Velleius Paterculus, 2, 35.

<p>f 13 wno na< * charge of the prison, and of the execution of condemned
</p>
<p>criminals. They judged also concerning slaves, and persons of the
</p>
<p>lowest rank. They were likewise called Tresviri or Treviri. From
</p>
<p>Valerius Maximus, (5, 4, 7,) it appears that they acted commonly
</p>
<p>by deputies.
</p>
<p>8. Locus  quod, &c. The relative here agrees in gender with
</p>
<p>the following noun. Some grammarians term this the Greek con-
</p>
<p>struction. It is the usual practice of Cicero ; but other authors give
</p>
<p>the relative the gender of the preceding noun : Cicero himself adopts
</p>
<p>this latter custom when the word explained is a foreign one : as,
</p>
<p>" cohiberc motus animi quos Graeci nddrt vocant :" still, however, he
</p>
<p>has also the following : " consensus quamcvfiir&dciav Graeci vocant.'''
</p>
<p>Zumpt. L. G.. p. 238.
</p>
<p>9. Tullianum. The prison at Rome was originally built by
</p>
<p>Ancus Martius, and afterwards enlarged by Servius Tullius ; whence
</p>
<p>that part of it which was under ground, and built by him, received
</p>
<p>the name of Tullianum. Thus Varro (L. L. 4) observes, " In hoc,
</p>
<p>pars quae sub terra Tullianum, ideo quod additum a Tullio rege."
</p>
<p>The full expression is Tullianum robur, from its walls having been
</p>
<p>originally of oak ; but in the days of Sallust they were of stone.
</p>
<p>This dungeon now serves as a subterranean chapel to a small church
</p>
<p>bo lit on the spot, called San Pietro in career e, in commemoration
</p>
<p>of St. Peter, who is supposed to have been confined there. Its only
</p>
<p>entrance, when a dungeon, was through a hole in the arched roof;
</p>
<p>now, however, there is a door in the side-wall. " Notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the change," observes Eustace, " it has still a most appalling ap-
</p>
<p>pearance." Eustace Class. Tour, vol. 1, p. 365, note. Lond. ed.
</p>
<p>10. Escenderis. An archaism for ascenderis. Some editions
</p>
<p>have descendcris, but erroneously , for escoideris refers to the eleva-
</p>
<p>tion on which the prison stood. Compare Descrizzione di Roma
</p>
<p>Antica, p. 151, where the different opinions are stated relative to
</p>
<p>the situation of the Tullianum.

<p>13. Quibus praeceptum erant. Understand lictores. Compare
</p>
<p>note 7, page 113.
</p>
<p>14. Laqueo gulam fregere. u Strangled him." It was the Ro-
</p>
<p>man custom to put to death criminals of rank in prison ; to inflict
</p>
<p>public punishment on others.
</p>
<p>15. Ex omni copia. " Out of the entire force."
</p>
<p>16. Duas legiones instituit. " Formed two legions." Catiline
</p>
<p>formed, if the expression may be allowed, the skeletons of two le-
</p>
<p>gions. He had not, at first, a sufficient number of men to form the
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. 287
</p>
<p>Page.
</p>
<p>regular complement of each legion ; still, however, he divided what 11Q
</p>
<p>men he had into twenty cohorts, ten for a legion, and these cohorts
</p>
<p>he subdivided into maniples and centuries. The cohorts, maniples,
</p>
<p>and centuries, all wanted at first their regular complement of men,
</p>
<p>and only obtained it gradually as fresh troops arrived at the
</p>
<p>camp.
</p>
<p>17. Numero hominum. " With the regular number of men."
</p>
<p>The legion, as has already been remarked in the Notes to the Jugur-
</p>
<p>thine War, contained different numbers of men at different times,
</p>
<p>from 3000 to 6000. In the time of Polybius it was 4200. The
</p>
<p>subject is well discussed by Lipsius, De Militia Romana, dial. 4.
</p>
<p>Each legion was divided into ten cohorts, each cohort into three
</p>
<p>maniples, and each maniple into two centuries. So that there were
</p>
<p>thirty maniples and sixty centuries in a legion, and if there always
</p>
<p>had been 100 men in each century, as its name imports, the legion
</p>
<p>would have consisted of 6000 men.
</p>
<p>18. Sparos. " Darts." The form of this weapon is not clearly
</p>
<p>ascertained. Servius {ad Aen. 11, 682) describes it as follows :
</p>
<p>" Telum rusticum in modum pedis (read, with R. Stephens, pedi)
</p>
<p>recurvum." Festus observes, " Spar a parvissimi generis jacula,
</p>
<p>ab eo quod spargantur dicta" and Nonius, (c. 18, n. 12,) " Spari
</p>
<p>tela sunt non bellica."
</p>
<p>1. Praeacutas sudes. u Stakes pointed at the end." 11/1
</p>
<p>2. In Galliam versus. " In the direction of Gaul," or, " towards
</p>
<p>Gaul."
</p>
<p>3. Sese habiturum. " That he himself would soon have one."
</p>
<p>Understand occasionem pugnandi. Some editions have magnas
</p>
<p>copias habiturum.
</p>
<p>4. Cujus. " Of which class of persons." Understand generis,
</p>
<p>or servitii. Singular relatives are sometimes referred to collective
</p>
<p>antecedents in the plural. Compare Priscian, 17, 20, vol. 2, p. 81,
</p>
<p>ed. Krehl. " Cujus enim smgulare ad rem retulit (Sallustius) id

<p>this passage of Sallust.

<p>5. Alienum suis rationibus. " Inconsistent with hi3 views."
</p>
<p>Catiline, however, had intended originally to have employed the
</p>
<p>services of the slaves. Compare chapters 24 and 46 of this same
</p>
<p>history.

<p>6. In agrum Pistorienscm. " Into the territory of Pistoria."

<p>and another after expeditus, which then may signify " unencumber-
</p>
<p>ed by baggage." We have given, however, the reading of Cortius,
</p>
<p>which may be rendered as follows : " encountering- fewer obstacles
</p>
<p>to his progress along a more level country :" fewer obstacles,
</p>
<p>namely, than Catiline did in his passage across the mountains.
</p>
<p>Others prefer placing a comma after acquioribus, and reading ex-
</p>
<p>pedites in fugam sequeretur. They make expedites in fugam equiv-
</p>
<p>alent to sine impediments fugientcs.

</p>
<p>12. Pedibus aeger. Dio Cassms informs us that Antonius
</p>
<p>feigned illness on the day of battle, fearful of encountering the re-
</p>
<p>proaches of Catiline in case the latter should meet him in the fight.
</p>
<p>Catiline, according to the same authority, preferred coming to an
</p>
<p>engagement with the forces of Antonius rather than with those of
</p>
<p>Metellus, although the former commander had the larger army of the
</p>
<p>two, because he hoped that Antonius would purposely mismanage
</p>
<p>matters during the fight. Dio. Cass. 37, 39, vol. 1, p. 136, ed.
</p>

</p>
<p>13. Tumulti. A war in Italy, or against the Gauls, was called
</p>
<p>tumult us, a much stronger term than bellum.
</p>
<p>14. Ipse. Some commentators condemn the use of ipse in this,
</p>
<p>and ille in the preceding clause, with reference to the same person.
</p>
<p>The explanation, however, is an easy one : Antonius exercitum
</p>
<p>Petreio permittit. Ille Petreius, &c, (" that officer ;") and again,
</p>
<p>Petreius suum cuiquc cohorti locum assignat. Ipse equo circumiens,
</p>
<p>("riding around in person.")

<p>15. Inermos. Incrmus and inermis are indiscriminately used.
</p>
<p>16. Cernere. Used here for decerncre : the simple verb for the
</p>
<p>compound.  Homo miiitaris. Used, kclt i^o^hv, for u homo rei
</p>
<p>mditaris peritissimus" "a man of great military experience.''
</p>
<p>17. Tribunus. " Tribune." The military tribunes of the Ro-

<p>in the army. The tuba was straight, like our trumpet ; the Jituus,
</p>
<p>or clarion, was bent a little at the end, like the augur's staff,
</p>
<p>(lituus) whence the name. The tuba was used as a signal for the
</p>
<p>foot, the lituus for the horse. Compare Lipsius, dc Militia Romana,

<p>1. Cohortem praetoriam. Among the Romans, the general 1 l*y
</p>
<p>was usually attended by a select band, called cohors Praetoria. It
</p>
<p>was first instituted by Scipio Africanus, according to Festus, but
</p>
<p>something similar was used long before that time, as appears from
</p>
<p>Livy, 2, 20. This differs essentially from the praetorian cohort in

<p>the history of the empire.

<p>2. In primis. " Among the first," not, as some render it,

</p>
<p>said of them, that they fell fighting " among the foremost," or "in
</p>
<p>the foremost ranks ;" for how could they, as commanders, have done
</p>
<p>otherwise ? Besides, if such had been the meaning of the historian,
</p>
<p>he would have preferred to express it by inter primos.

<p>Gaudium, on the contrary, indicates the calm and rational emotion
</p>
<p>of joy. So moeror denotes sorrow accompanied by tears, luctus

<p>stages, yet proved one of those violent shocks that hastened the fall of
</p>
<p>the Roman state. It may not be amiss, before concluding, to mention
</p>
<p>a few particulars which are passed over in silence by the historian.
</p>
<p>From Dio Cassius, Lib. 37, c. 40 and 41, we learn, that Antonius, after
</p>
<p>the battle, sent the head of Catiline to Rome, in order to quiet all ap-
</p>
<p>prehension on the part of the inhabitants ; and that he himself was
</p>
<p>honoured with the title of Imperator, although he had taken no active part
</p>
<p>in the fight, and although the number of slain (3000) was less than

</p>
<p>that for which this title was usually awarded, (5000.) A public thanks-
</p>
<p>giving was also decreed, and the garb of mourning, which the citizens
</p>
<p>had assumed when the conspiracy broke out, was again laid aside. The
</p>
<p>accomplices of Catiline, who had either not been present in the battle,
</p>
<p>or had escaped from the field, spread themselves over Italy, but were
</p>
<p>in part taken and executed. One of the number, Lucius Vettius,
</p>
<p>turned informer against the rest : but he accused so many as to excite
</p>
<p>the suspicion of the senate, who ordered him, not to commit to writing
</p>
<p>the names of those against whom he informed, but to mention them at
</p>
<p>once by word of mouth. This confused and alarmed him, and but few
</p>
<p>were subsequently accused. The names of those whom he had impli-
</p>
<p>cated having been concealed from the people at large, great confusion
</p>
<p>and alarm consequently prevailed. To quiet this general feeling of in-
</p>
<p>security, the senate resolved to publish the names in question, which
</p>
<p>was accordingly done. Some of the accused stood trial and were con-

</p>
<p>Aborigines. A name given by the Roman writers to the primitive
</p>
<p>race of the Latins. According to Cato, they dwelt originally about
</p>
<p>mount Velmo, in Italy, and the lake of Cclano, (Fucinus,) as far as Car-
</p>
<p>seoli, and towards Reate ; but were driven onward by the Sabines, who
</p>
<p>came from Aquila. {Dion. Hal. 2, 49.) On leaving this vicinity, they
</p>
<p>came down the Anio, and expelled the Siculi from the neighbourhood
</p>
<p>of Tibur, Antemnae, Crustumerium, and Aricia. Sallust represents them
</p>
<p>as a savage race, living in hordes, without any civilization, and ignorant
</p>
<p>of agriculture. This, however, does not agree with the traces of their
</p>
<p>towns in the Apennines. The Aborigines revered Janus and Saturn ;
</p>
<p>the latter of whom, according to some authorities, taught them hus-
</p>
<p>bandry, and induced them to choose settled habitations. From this
</p>
<p>ancient race, blended with a remnant of the Siculi, came the later Latin
</p>
<p>nation. (Compare Niebuhr, Rom. Hist., vol. i., p. 62. Cambridge
</p>
<p>Transl.) p. 82.
</p>
<p>Aegyptus. An extensive country of Africa, consisting of the long
</p>
<p>and narrow valley which follows the course of the Nile, from Syene
</p>
<p>(Assooan) to Cairo, together with the Delta, or triangular region, spread-
</p>
<p>ing from this point, to the Mediterranean sea. Sallust and Pomponius
</p>
<p>Mela (1,8) consider it as a part of Asia, making Africa end at the
</p>
<p>Catabathmus. Other ancient writers give the Nile as forming the divi-
</p>
<p>ding line between Asia and Africa ; and, of course, make Egypt belong
</p>
<p>half to the former continent and half to the latter. . . p. 14.
</p>
<p>Aethiopes. A race, according to Sallust, occupying the central parts
</p>
<p>of Africa, from east to west. The early Greeks meant by Aethiopes all
</p>
<p>races of a dark complexion (<it0w, uro, and a>xp, vultus,) and called theii
</p>
<p>country Aethiopia, wherever situated. Hence, Homer speaks of the
</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Aethiopians, meaning by the former the Arabians,
</p>
<p>Indi, &c, and by the latter the natives of central Africa. Aethiopia,
</p>
<p>according to the more definite account of Herodotus, includes the coun-
</p>
<p>tries above Egypt, the present Nubia and Abyssinia ; and it is in some-
</p>
<p>what the same sense that the term is now employed, when we speak of
</p>
<p>Aethiopia as the parent of Egyptian civilization. . . p. 14 .

<p>Africa. Called by the Greeks Libya ; and commonly regarded by
</p>
<p>the ancients as forming the third division of the world. Some, however,
</p>
<p>of the geographers of antiquity considered the world as composed of four
</p>
<p>parts, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Egypt ; and others again of only two,

<p>296 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.
</p>
<p>Europe and Asia, including Africa in Europe. In general, Africa was
</p>
<p>reckoned a third part. The name was first applied by the Romans to
</p>
<p>the immediate territories of Carthage. Hence, we find, on the coast of
</p>
<p>the Mediterranean, Africa Propria, corresponding to the modern country
</p>
<p>of Tunis. On the east, Africa is bounded by the isthmus of Suez, and
</p>
<p>the Sinus Arabicus, or Red sea ; on the north by the Mediterranean,
</p>
<p>called by the Romans Mare Nostrum ; on the west by the Atlantic ; and
</p>
<p>on the south by the Indian ocean. It is extremely doubtful whether the
</p>
<p>ancients were acquainted with the circumnavigation of Africa. Hero-

<p>Arretinus Ager. The territory of Arretium, a city of Etruria,
</p>
<p>north of Cortona, and near the Arnus, or Arno. Its modem name is
</p>
<p>Artzzo. Arretium was a place of considerable celebrity, and generally-
</p>
<p>considered as one of the principal states of Etruria. It was much cele-
</p>
<p>brated for its terra cotta vases. (Plin. H. N. 35, 12.) . p. 97.
</p>
<p>Asia. One of the divisions of the ancient world. (Via 1 . Africa.)
</p>
<p>The name of Asia was applied by Homer, Herodotus, and Euripides, to
</p>
<p>a district of Lydia, watered by the Cayster. As their geographical
</p>
<p>knowledge of the continent increased, the Greeks extended the term
</p>
<p>gradually to the whole of Asia Minor, and eventually to the other ex-
</p>
<p>tensive countries of the East. When the Roman writers refer to Asia
</p>
<p>specially, they mean the Roman province in Asia Minor. . p. 13, 85.

<p>Baleares. A name anciently given to the islands of Majorca and
</p>
<p>Minorca. The word is derived from the Greek fidWeiv, " to throw,"
</p>
<p>or " strike, 1 ' from the expertness of the inhabitants in the use of the
</p>
<p>sling. The Romans obtained some of their best slingers from these
</p>
<p>islands. In Majorca is Palma, which still retains its ancient name. In
</p>
<p>Minorca is Portus Magonis, now Port Mahon. ... p. 72.
</p>
<p>Bruttii. A people of Magna Graecia, below Lucania. They were
</p>
<p>a pastoral race, and, according to some of the ancient writers, were called
</p>
<p>Bruttii by the Romans, from their cowardice in submitting to Hannibal
</p>
<p>during the second Punic war. A much better etymology, however, is
</p>
<p>given by Strabo, who informs us, that they were called Bruttii from the
</p>
<p>circumstance of their being revolted slaves ; ^perriovs yap ko\<>voi dirocTd-

<p>Bruttii flocked eagerly to the victorious standard of Hannibal, and sub-
</p>
<p>sequently enabled that commander to maintain his ground in this quarter

<p>of Italv, when all hope of final success seemed to be extinguished.

<p>Capua was the chief city. The natural advantages of Campania, its

<p>Capsa. A city of Africa, in the district of Bvzacium, north of the
</p>
<p>Palus Tritonis, and surrounded by vast deserts. Here Jugurtha kept
</p>
<p>his treasures. It was surprised aud burnt by Marius. As, however, a

<p>place which affords fresh water in the midst of a desert is too important

<p>a site to remain long unoccupied, we find the city subsequently rebuilt,
</p>
<p>and the inhabitants mentioned by Pliny (H. N. 5. 4) under the name
</p>
<p>of Capsitani. Ptolemy speaks of Capsa as a city in his days, occupied
</p>
<p>most probably by Romans, and forming a kind of frontier place. The

<p>origin which Sallust a- ; been founded, namely,
</p>
<p>by the Lybian Hercules, assimilates it to the cities of Egypt, and points

<p>to a sacerdotal colony. Even its other name, Hccatompvlos, reminds

<p>us of Egyptian Thebes and its hundred gates. (Mannc I vol. x.,

</p>
<p>ence of the site of Carthage was twenty-three miles, and when it was
</p>
<p>set on fire by the Romans, at the close of the third Punic war, it burnt
</p>
<p>incessantly for seventeen davs. It is unnecessary here to enter very
</p>
<p>fully mto the history of this powerful city. The wars w T aged between
</p>
<p>it and the Romans were denominated the Punic, and were three in
</p>
<p>number. The first Punic war continued twenty-three years, and was
</p>
<p>mated by the defeat of the Carthaginians off the Aegades Insulae.
</p>
<p>The second lasted about seventeen years, during nearly sixteen of which
</p>
<p>Hannibal was in Italy. It was ended by the battle of Zama. The third
</p>
<p>was nothing more than the capture and destruction of Carthage. Julius
</p>
<p>Caesar planted a small colony on the ruins of Carthage. Augustus sent
</p>
<p>3,000 men thither, and built a city at a small distance from the spot on
</p>
<p>which the ancient place had stood, thus avoiding the ill effects of the
</p>
<p>imprecations, which had been pronounced by the Romans, according to
</p>
<p>custom, at the time of its destructi" those who should rebuild
</p>
<p>it. This later Carthage was taken I D. 439, and it was

<p>for more than a century the seat of the Vandal power in Africa. It was

<p>Cirta. A city of Numidia, about forty-eight miles from the s^a, on

<p>a branch of the river Ampsagas. It was intended as the royal residence,
</p>
<p>300 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.
</p>
<p>and being, in fact, the only city originally in that part of the country,
</p>
<p>and erected by Carthaginian workmen, it hence took the Punic name of
</p>
<p>Cartha, or, " the city." It was the residence of Svphax, Masinissa, and
</p>
<p>the other rulers of the land. At a later period, Julius Caesar gave it to
</p>
<p>a certain Sittius, who aided him with his followers against Scipio and
</p>
<p>Juba. The place now changed its name to Sittianorum Colonic. In
</p>
<p>the time of the emperor Constantine, having suffered much on account
</p>
<p>of its fidelity to that prince, the latter repaired and embellished it, and
</p>
<p>gave it the name of Constantino.. This name remains with a slight
</p>
<p>variation to the present day, and the small city, built upon the ruins of

<p>the ancient capital is still called Cosantina. ... p. 16.

<p>Etruria. A district of Italy, lying north and west of the Tiber.
</p>
<p>The origin of the Etrurian nation is unknown, although many, without
</p>
<p>any very strong reasons for the opinion, regard them as having been a
</p>
<p>Celtic race. Their civilization came in with the Tyrrheni, who appear
</p>
<p>to have been identical with the Pelasgi. The statement of Herodotus,
</p>
<p>that the Tyrrheni, or Etrurians, were of Lydian origin, appears to refer
</p>
<p>merely to a Pelasgic emigration. The Etrurians excelled in the know-
</p>
<p>ledge of augury, and in the worship of the gods. In these respects the
</p>
<p>Romans seem to have done little more than adopt the ceremonies and
</p>
<p>institutions of their neighbours, who were for a long period their de-
</p>
<p>termined and powerful enemies. After long continued war and much
</p>
<p>carnage, the Romans obtained a complete victory over them, and com-
</p>
<p>pelled them to submit to such conditions as they chose to dictate. The
</p>
<p>Etrurians were divided into twelve states, of which each adopted that
</p>
<p>form of government which seemed most agreeable, though the leading
</p>
<p>feature in all was aristocratic. The want of a common bond of union
</p>
<p>contributed verv materially to their final subjugation by the Romans.

<p>Etruria corresponds, in a great measure, to the present Grand Duchy
</p>
<p>of Tuscany. ......... p- 93.

</p>
<p>d in the vicinity of this place p. 92.

<p>Gallia. An extensive country of Europe, lying between the Rhine,
</p>
<p>the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pyrenees, and the ocean. It was more
</p>
<p>extensive, therefore, to the north and east than modern France. The
</p>
<p>name Galli, given to the inhabitants by the Roman writers, is the Celtic
</p>
<p>term Gael, Latinised. The Greeks called them Kelrai, and their coun-
</p>
<p>try KcXtikti and Ta^aria.
</p>
<p>Gallia Citerior. Called also Gallia Cisalpina, a name given by the
</p>
<p>Romans to that part of Italy which lay between the Alps and the rivers
</p>
<p>Rubicon and Macra. It was occupied by various Gallic tribes, which
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>302 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.
</p>
<p>had poured over the Alps into this extensive tract of country. Livy
</p>
<p>assigns to these migrations the date of 600 B. C. ; but in all probability
</p>
<p>they were much earlier.
</p>
<p>Gallia Cispadana. Gaul south of the Padus, or Po ; or, in other
</p>
<p>words, that part of northern Italy which lay between the Po and the
</p>
<p>rivers Rubicon and Macra. The remaining portion between the Po and
</p>
<p>the Alps, was called Gallia Transpadana.
</p>
<p>Gallia Togata. Commonly regarded as only another name for
</p>
<p>Gallia Cisalpina, but applying in strictness merely to Gallia Cispadana.
</p>
<p>The name has reference to the country's being occupied by individuals
</p>
<p>who enjoyed the rights of Roman citizenship, or, in other words, the
</p>
<p>privilege of wearing the toga. These inhabitants appear to have been
</p>
<p>settled here in colonies after the Gauls were driven out. (Compare
</p>
<p>Manner t, Geogr., vol. x., part 1, p. 133.)
</p>
<p>Gallia Transalpina. Gaul beyond the Alps, or Gaul Proper.

</p>
<p>Hadrumetum. The capital of Byzacium, a district of Africa Propria.
</p>
<p>The place, according to Sallust, was of Phoenician origin, and owed its
</p>
<p>prosperity, in a great measure, to the fertility of the surrounding coun-
</p>
<p>try ; since, although situate near the coast, it does not appear to have had
</p>
<p>any harbour. It suffered severely in Caesar's wars, but was afterwards
</p>
<p>restored and enlarged by a colony being sent hither in the time of the
</p>
<p>emperors, especially Trajan. The place was destroyed by the Saracens.
</p>
<p>Its site has been made a matter of much discussion at the present day.

<p>D'Anville places it near the modern Susa, in the territory of Tunis.

<p>Hippo. A city of Numidia, in the western part, on a bay near the
</p>
<p>promontory of Hippi. It was called Hippo Regius, not only to dis-
</p>
<p>tinguish it from Hippo Zarytus, a town on the coast to the west of Utica,
</p>
<p>but also from its having been one of the royal cities of the Numidian
</p>
<p>monarchs. The place was of Phoenician origin. St. Augustine was
</p>
<p>bishop here. Near the ancient site is a town named Bona. . p. 14.

<p>Hispania. An extensive country, forming a kind of peninsula, in the
</p>
<p>southwestern part of Europe. It was divided into Hispania Citerior
</p>
<p>and Ulterior. Hispania Citerior was also called Tarraconensis, from
</p>
<p>Tarraco (now Tarragona) its capital, and extended from the foot of the
</p>
<p>Pyrenees to the mouth of the Durius (now Douro) on the Atlantic shore ;
</p>
<p>comprehending all the north of Spain, together with the south, as far as
</p>
<p>a line drawn below Carthago Nova, (now Carthagena,) and continued
</p>
<p>in an oblique direction to the river Durius, passing by Salamantica
</p>
<p>(now Salanunica). Hispania Ulterior was divided into two provinces,
</p>
<p>Baetica, in the south of Spain, between the Anas (now Guadiana) and
</p>
<p>Citerior ; and above it Lusitania, corresponding, in a great measure, to

</p>
<p>into Gallia Cisalpina, in the north, from the Alps to the rivers Rubicon,
</p>
<p>on the upper, and Macra, on the lower coast ; Italia Propria, in the
</p>
<p>centre, and Magna Graecia, in the south. The last of these took its
</p>
<p>name from the Greek colonies settled there, and comprehended the prov-
</p>
<p>inces of Campania, Apulia, Lucania, Messapia, and Bruttium. All
</p>
<p>between Magna Graecia and the rivers Rubicon and Macra, was
</p>
<p>Italia Propria, and under the immediate jurisdiction of the senate and
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>Lares. A town of Africa Propria, west of Zama Regia, and south
</p>
<p>of Sicca Venerea. Its site is supposed to be marked at the present
</p>
<p>dav by the modern Larbuss. (Bischoff und Moller, Worterb. der Geogr.,
</p>
<p>p. 682.) p. 61.
</p>
<p>Latium. A country of Italy, lying south of Etruria, from which it
</p>
<p>was separated by the river Tiber. In it stood Rome, Alba, Lavinium,
</p>
<p>Tusculum, Arpinum, Praenestc, &c. The name of Latium was at first
</p>
<p>given to that portion of Italy only, which extends from the mouth of the
</p>
<p>Tiber to the promontory of Circeii : but subsequently this latter boundary
</p>
<p>was removed to the river Liris, whence arose the distinction of Latium
</p>
<p>Antiquum and Novum. At a still later period, the southern boundary
</p>
<p>of Latium was extended from the Liris to the mouth of the river Vultur-
</p>
<p>nus and the Massic hills. . ..... p. 47.
</p>
<p>Leptis. There were two cities of this name in Africa. 1. The firsts
</p>
<p>called for distinction sake Leptis Magna, was situate towards the
</p>
<p>greater Syrtis, at the southeast extremity of the district of Tripolis. 1%
</p>
<p>was founded by the Phoenicians, and ranked next to Carthage and Utica,
</p>
<p>among their maritime cities. Under the Romans, it was signalized, as
</p>
<p>Sallust informs us, by its fidelity and obedience. It was destroyed by
</p>
<p>the Vandals, rebuilt by the emperor Justinian, and finally demolished by
</p>
<p>the Saracens. Lebida now marks the ancient site. 2. The other city
</p>
<p>of Leptis, called also Leptis Parva, was situate in Africa Propria, in
</p>
<p>the district of Byzacium, or Emporiae, about eighteen miles below Ha-
</p>
<p>drumetum, on the coast. It is now Lcmpta. This city paid a talent

<p>Libya. The name given by the Greek writers and the Roman poets

<p>to what was otherwise called Africa. In a more restricted sense, the
</p>
<p>name has been applied to that part of Africa which contained the two

<p>Cisalpine Gaul, and lay along the shores of the Sinus Ligusticus, or
</p>
<p>gulf of Genoa, between the Varus on the west, and the Macra on the
</p>
<p>east. The Ligures appear to have been a numerous and powerful people,

<p>extending at an early period along the shores of the Mediterranean, from
</p>

<p>they were not conquered by the Romans until after many years of war-

<p>Macedonia. A country of Europe, lying to the west of Thrace, and
</p>
<p>north and northeast of Thessalv. It was reduced under the Roman
</p>
<p>sway by Paulus Aemilius, who defeated and took prisoner its last monarch
</p>
<p>Perses, in the memorable battle of Pydna. Before the time of Philip,
</p>
<p>father of Alexander, all the country beyond the river Strymon, and even
</p>
<p>the Macedonian peninsula, from Amphipoiis to Thessalonica, belonged
</p>
<p>to Thrace, and Paeonia likewise on the north. But, when enlarged
</p>
<p>by conquest, the limits of Macedonia were from the river Nessus in
</p>
<p>Thrace to the Ionian sea, including Paeonia, and Illyria beyond lake
</p>
<p>Lychnitis. As a Roman province, however, Macedonia did not include
</p>
<p>Epirus. ......... p. 25.

<p>Massilia. A celebrated colony of the Phoceans, on the Mediter-
</p>
<p>ranean coast of Gaul, n > f 'lcs. It became at an early p
</p>
<p>powerful and flourishing city, and was famed for ill commerce.
</p>
<p>The most prosperous period in its historv would seem to have been the
</p>
<p>interval from the fall of Carthage, with which city it had frequent col-
</p>
<p>lisions, to the commencement of the r r and Pom-
</p>
<p>pey. This city was always the firm ally of Rome. It suffered severely
</p>
<p>in the civil wars from its attachment to the party of Pompey, being
</p>
<p>compelled to sustain a severe siejje, in which its fleet was destroyed,
</p>
<p>and, after lOITendering, to pav a heaw exaction. Massilia became after-

<p>Numantia. A town of Spain, near the sources of the river Durius,
</p>
<p>celebrated for the brave resistance which it made against the Romans
</p>
<p>for the space of fourteen years. It was built upon an eminence of no
</p>
<p>great height, between two branches of the Durius, and surrounded by a
</p>
<p>very thick wood on three sides. One path alone led down into the
</p>
<p>plain, and this was defended by ditches and palisades. The great length
</p>
<p>of time it withstood the Romans may be easilv accounted for by its dif-
</p>
<p>ficult situation, and the circumstance of its circuit being so large, that
</p>
<p>within it were even pastures for cattle. The place was at last reduced
</p>
<p>by Scipio Africanus Minor, the conqueror of Carthage. The Numan-
</p>
<p>tines had withstood an army of 40,000 men with less than one fourth of
</p>
<p>that number, and had not only hitherto held out, but frequently gained
</p>
<p>very considerable advantages over the enemy, and obliged them to ac-
</p>
<p>cede to dishonourable treaties. The remains of Numantia may be still
</p>
<p>seen near Puente de Don Garray. . . . . . p. 5.
</p>
<p>Numidia. A country of Africa, east of Mauretania, and correspond-
</p>
<p>ing, in a great measure, to the modern Algiers. It was originally
</p>
<p>divided into two petty kingdoms, that of the Massyli to the east, and of
</p>
<p>the Massaesvli to the west, the line of separation between them being
</p>
<p>marked by the Tretum Promontorium, and a part of the river Ampsagas,
</p>
<p>Syphax was monarch of the Massaesvli, and Massinissa of the Massyli.
</p>
<p>The territory of Svphax was bestowed upon Massinissa by the Romans,
</p>
<p>after the close of the second Punic war, and he was allowed to enjoy
</p>
<p>the possession of them until the day of his death. After the termination
</p>
<p>of the Jugurthine contest, the Romans appear to have taken no part
</p>
<p>of the kingdom of Numidia to themselves, but to have distributed it
</p>
<p>among the different surviving branches of the royal line. In the civil
</p>
<p>wars between Caesar and Pompey, Juba, the great grandson of Massinissa,
</p>
<p>had the misfortune to espouse the side of the latter. After the victory of
</p>
<p>Thapsus, therefore, Caesar declared the whole kingdom of Numidia to
</p>
<p>be a Roman territory ; and Sallust, the historian, was sent thither as
</p>
<p>its governor. The western district around Cirta was at the same time

<p>empire, bounded on the east by Carmania, on the north by Media, on

<p>Philenon Arae. Altars erected by the Carthaginians in memory
</p>
<p>of the brothers Phileni. They stood in the innermost bend of the Syrtis
</p>
<p>Major, and not, as Sallust erroneously states, {Jug. 19,) to the west of
</p>
<p>both the Syrtes. The story of the Phileni, as given by the historian,
</p>
<p>wears, to many, a very doubtful appearance, from the circumstance of
</p>
<p>Cyrene's being so much nearer to the point in question than Carthage.
</p>
<p>If the distance between these two cities be divided into eight equal
</p>
<p>parts, the Phileni will be found to have travelled six, and the deputies
</p>
<p>from Cyrene only two, of these parts. The truth, however, ap-
</p>
<p>pears to be, that the territory in dispute between the two powers, lay
</p>
<p>between Hesperis on the Cyrenean side, and Leptis Magna on the
</p>
<p>Carthaginian, and that the deputies started actually from these two
</p>

<p>Pistoria. A town of Etruria, about twenty Italian miles northwest
</p>
<p>of Florentia, on the Stella, which falls into the Omhroac, a northern
</p>
<p>branch of the Arnus, or Arno. Pliny (H. X 3. 5) calls it Pistorium ;
</p>
<p>but Ptolemy and others give it the appellation of Pistoria. The modern
</p>
<p>name is Pistoia. This place is memorable from having witnessed in
</p>
<p>its vicinity the close of Catiline's desperate career. The spot on which
</p>
<p>the action was fought is too imperfectly marked by the concise
</p>
<p>tive of Sallust to be now recognised. We mav conjecture, however,
</p>
<p>that it was to the north of Pistoui, and near the modern road from that

<p>place to Modena. (Cramer's Ancient Italy, vol. L, p. 177.) p. 114.

<p>RhegTum. One of the most celebrated and flourishing cities of Magna
</p>
<p>Graecia, at the extremity of Italy, in the territory of the Bruttii. It is
</p>
<p>supposed to have been founded nearly 700 years B. C, by a party of
</p>
<p>Zancleans from Sicily, together with some Chalcidians, from Euboea,
</p>
<p>and Messenians from the Peloponnesus. Its name is supposed to allude
</p>
<p>to the great catastrophe by which Sicily was broken off in early days
</p>
<p>from Italy ('Pfiyiov a pijywfii, frango.) Some, however, consider the
</p>
<p>name of the place as of Oscan origin. The modern appellation is
</p>
<p>Rcggio. p. 20.
</p>
<p>Rhodii. The people of the island of Rhodes. This celebrated island
</p>
<p>lay to the southwest of the coast of Caria, and about forty-three miles
</p>
<p>distant from the main land. Rhodes sided with the Roman power, and
</p>
<p>became a valuable auxiliary to their rising greatness. In return for the
</p>
<p>important services thus rendered, it received from its new friends the
</p>
<p>territories of Lycia and Caria ; but suspicion and distrust eventually
</p>
<p>arose, the Rhodians were deprived of their possessions in Asia, and, at
</p>
<p>last, in the reign of Vespasian, of their freedom. Rhodes was famed
</p>
<p>for its Colossus, or statue of the sun, the work of Chares, who spent
</p>
<p>twelve years in the execution. An earthquake threw it down after it
</p>
<p>had stood erect for sixty-six years. It remained in ruins for 894 years,
</p>
<p>until A. D. 672, when the Saracens sold it to a Jewish merchant of
</p>
<p>Edessa, who loaded 900 camels with the brass. . . p. 106.

<p>Roma. Of this celebrated city, it will be sufficient here to remark,
</p>
<p>that it stood on the southern bank of the Tiber, below the junction of
</p>
<p>that river and the Anio, and about fifteen miles from the sea. It was
</p>
<p>divided into twenty-four regions or wards, had seven great, and thirteen
</p>
<p>smaller, aqueducts, thirty-seven gates, and six hundred and forty-four
</p>
<p>towers on the walls. Its population, when greatest, did not proba-
</p>
<p>bly fall much below four millions. The seat of empire was transferred
</p>
<p>to Bvzantium, by Constantine, A. D. 328 ; and Rome itself w r as taken .
</p>
<p>by Odoacer, king of the Heruli, A. D. 476, which put an end to the

<p>east of Campania and the lower extremity of Latium. The Samnites
</p>
<p>were of Sabine origin, and famed for their valour, which displayed itself
</p>
<p>in their long conflict with the Roman power. They only ceased to
</p>
<p>exist as a nation after their overthrow by Sylla. ... p. 108.
</p>
<p>Sicca. A city of Numidia, on the river Bagradas, and at some dis-
</p>
<p>tance from the coast. It was called Sicca Venerea, from a temple of
</p>
<p>Venus which it contained. Bochart and De Brosses derive the name
</p>
<p>of Sicca from the Punic Succoth Benoth, (i. e. " tabernacula puellarum,")
</p>
<p>and make Bcnoth ("puella'') the origin of the word Venus among the
</p>
<p>Romans. According to Shaw, the modern Kaff stands near the site of
</p>
<p>the ancient city. This, however, is doubtful. ... p. 39.
</p>
<p>Sicilia. A well-known island in the Mediterranean, separated from
</p>
<p>Italy by the Fretum Siculum, or Straits of Messina. Its triangular
</p>
<p>shape gave it the appellations of Trinacria and Triquetra, (rpeTg-aKoai,
</p>
<p>and Tpeis-Ztpat.) The promontory nearest Italy was called Pelorum,
</p>
<p>now cape Faro. The one to the south of this w^as Pachynum, now
</p>
<p>308 GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.
</p>
<p>Passaro; and the remaining one Lilybaeum, now Boeo. This last,
</p>
<p>however, is in truth not a mountain-promontory, but a low, flat point of
</p>
<p>land, rendered dangerous to vessels by its sand-banks and concealed
</p>
<p>rocks. Sicilia derived its name from the ancient Siculi, who came into
</p>
<p>this island from Latium. . .... p. 20.

<p>Sidonii. The people of Sidon, in Phoenicia. This was the oldest,
</p>
<p>and, until eclipsed by its colony Tyre, the most powerful of the Phoeni-
</p>
<p>cian cities. The inhabitants appear to have acquired at an early period
</p>
<p>a pre-eminence in arts, manufactures, and commerce. The modern
</p>
<p>Saide is still a considerable town, but the harbour is nearly choked with
</p>
<p>sand. Sidon was about twenty-four miles north of Tyre. p. 51.
</p>
<p>Suthul. A town of Numidia, of which Sallust alone makes mention.
</p>
<p>M. Barbie du Bocage suspects that this town is the same with that called
</p>
<p>Sufetala (now Sbaitla) in the Itin. Ant. The name Suthul is said to
</p>
<p>signify " the town of eagles." ...... p. 27.

<p>Syrtes. The Syrtes were two bays or gulfs on the coast of Africa,
</p>
<p>of which the one was called Svrtis Major, the other Syrtis Minor. The
</p>
<p>latter is now termed the gulf of Cahcs, from the ancient city of Tacape,
</p>
<p>which stood at the head of it. It is about forty-: .,>hical miles
</p>
<p>in breadth, and runs up into the continent about seventy-five miles. It
</p>
<p>is opposite to the islands of Sicily and Malta, and was reckoned the
</p>
<p>more dangerous of the two This gulf is still an object of apprehension
</p>
<p>to mariners, in consequence of the variations and uncertainties of the
</p>
<p>tides on a flat and shelvv roast. The S >r is about one hundred

<p>Utica A city of Africa, on the seacoast, southwest of Carthage,

<p>and separated from its immediate district by the river Bagradas. Utica
</p>
<p>was the earliest, or one of the earliest, colonies planted by Tyre on the
</p>
<p>African coast ; and Bochart derives the name from the Phoenician Atike,
</p>
<p>i. e. " ancient." The Greek name of the place, '\tvkti, is perhaps a cor-
</p>
<p>ruption of this. Justin makes Utica more ancient than Carthage. It
</p>
<p>was more or less dependant, however, on the power of this latter city,
</p>
<p>and hence the disaffection frequently shown by its inhabitants to the Car-
</p>
<p>dan cause. Utica rose in importance after the fall of Carthage.
</p>
<p>When, however, Carthage was rebuilt, it again took the second rank.

<p>Adherbal. Son of Micipsa, and grandson of Masinissa, besieged at

<p>Cirta, and put to death by Jugurtha, after imploring in vain the aid of
</p>
<p>Rome, B. C. 112. Gesenius conjectures the origin of this proper

<p>Albinus. Aulus Postumius, brother of Spurius Postumius Albinus,
</p>
<p>the consul, who obtained by lot Numidia for his province, B. C. 112.
</p>
<p>Aulus, and the Roman army entrusted to his care by his brother, were
</p>
<p>entrapped by Jugurtha, and compelled to pass under the yoke. The senate

<p>i to ratify the treaty which he made on this occasion with the
</p>
<p>Numidian monarch. Livy (Ep. 64) calls him lieutenant-general, not
</p>
<p>propraetor, the term applied by Sallust.
</p>
<p>Spurius Postumius, elected consul with If. Minucius Rufus,
</p>
<p>112 B. C; and who, in the allotment of the provinces, obtained Numi-
</p>
<p>dia, while his colleague got Macedonia. He appears to have been a com-
</p>
<p>mander of very inferior abilities, and was repeatedly foiled and baffled by
</p>
<p>Jugurtha. Being compelled to return to Rome, to attend the elections,
</p>
<p>he left his army in charge of his brother Aulus, whom Jugurtha entrapped
</p>
<p>and compelled to pass under the yoke. On returning to Africa, he was
</p>
<p>forced by the wretched state of the troops to remain inictive. In this
</p>
<p>condition he resigned the army to Metellus, who superseded him in the
</p>
<p>command.
</p>
<p>Aw ius, Lucius. A tribune of the commons, who made a vigorous
</p>
<p>effort to retain his office, after the expiration of his legal term. He was
</p>
<p>aided in this attempt by one of his colleagues, P. Licinius Lucullus, in
</p>
<p>opposition to the other tribunes ; and the struggles of these two prevented
</p>
<p>the election of the other magistrates during a whole year.

<p>conspiracy of Catiline. He effected his escape, when some of the ring-

<p>leaders were apprehended, and appears to have eluded the search of the
</p>
<p>agents of government, and to have gone unpunished.
</p>
<p>Antonius, Caius. A Roman, son of M. Antonius, the orator, and
</p>
<p>brother of M. Antonius Creticus, the father of the triumvir. He was
</p>
<p>originally in habits of very great intimacy with Catiline, and the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment was that these two should stand for the consulship, and, if they

</p>
<p>succeeded, commence, while in this high office, their plans of revolution.
</p>
<p>Cicero defeated this scheme, and, being elected consul with Antonius for
</p>
<p>his colleague, succeeded in detaching the latter from the conspiracy, and
</p>
<p>from every other design formed against the state. He effected this de-
</p>
<p>sirable object by yielding to Antonius the rich province of Macedonia,
</p>
<p>which had fallen to his own lot. In the action between the forces of
</p>
<p>Catiline and those of the republic, Antonius took no part, having been
</p>
<p>prevented, according to Sallust, by a complaint in his feet. Dio Cassius,
</p>
<p>however, states expressly, that he feigned illness on this occasion, through
</p>
<p>fear of encountering the reproaches of Catiline, in case they should meet
</p>
<p>in the fight. After the conspiracy was crushed, Antonius went to his
</p>
<p>province of Macedonia, where he continued for two years, but, on his
</p>
<p>return to Rome, he was brought to trial, and banished, for having been
</p>
<p>guilty of extortion, and having made war beyond the limits of his pro-
</p>
<p>vince, (Liv. Epit. 103.) He was a man of very dissolute habits, and
</p>
<p>before he obtained the consulship had been expelled by the censors from
</p>
<p>the senate for immoral conduct.
</p>
<p>Aspar. A Numidian, sent to the court of Bocchus by Jugurtha, to
</p>
<p>obtain secret information respecting the intentions of the Mauretanian
</p>
<p>king with respect to himself and the Roman people. He was outwitted
</p>
<p>by Bocchus and Sylla, and the immediate consequence was the capture
</p>
<p>of Jugurtha.
</p>
<p>Aurelia Okesttt.la. A female of threat beauty, but very corrupt prin-
</p>
<p>ciples. Catiline offered her his hand in marriage, which she refused to
</p>
<p>accept, because he had a son by a former marriage, arrived at man's
</p>
<p>estate. To remove this obstacle Catiline put his son to death by ad-
</p>
<p>ministering poison. (Compare Val. Max. 9, 1.)
</p>
<p>Autroniis, P. A Roman of senatorian rank, who became consul
</p>
<p>elect, but afterwards lost the consulship on a charge of bribery. The
</p>
<p>consequent disgrace in which this involved him led him very probably to
</p>
<p>join the party of Catiline. After the overthrow of that party he succeeded
</p>
<p>in making his escape.

<p>Baebius, C. A tribune of the commons, on whom Jugurtha prevailed,

</p>
<p>Bellienus, L. The Roman praetor at Utica, whom Marius summoned
</p>
<p>to attend a council at Cirta, towards the end of the Jugurthine war.
</p>
<p>According to some he was the maternal uncle of Catiline.
</p>
<p>Bestia, L. Calpumius. A Roman nobleman, who held the consulship
</p>
<p>with Scipio Nasica, B. C. 113. It fell to his lot to carrv on the war m
</p>
<p>Numidia against Jugurtha, where, however, he acquired no fame, but
</p>
<p>was led by his avaricious feelings to receive a heavy bribe, and conclude
</p>
<p>a disadvantageous and dishonourable peace with Jugurtha. He was
</p>
<p>condemned under the Mamilian law, and died in exile. Besides the
</p>
<p>charges brought against him by Sallust, Pliny the elder mentions that
</p>
<p>M. Caecilius brought him to trial for poisoning at least two of his
</p>
<p>by wolfsbane.

<p>Bocchus. King of Mauretania, who betrayed Jugurtha into the hands

<p>of the Romans. He obtained as the reward of his treachery the western

<p>part of Numidia.

<p>Bomilcar. An officer in the army of Jugurtha, to whom he entrusted
</p>
<p>secret and important business. He conspired along with Nabdalsa
</p>
<p>against his master, but the plot was discovered and he lost his life.
</p>
<p>Brutus, D. Junius. The husband of Sempronia. His residence was
</p>
<p>near the forum, and into it Umbrenus took the ambassadors of the Allo-
</p>
<p>broges, and discovered to them the conspiracy of Catiline. From
</p>
<p>Sallust's mentioning that the meeting was held in his house when Brutus
</p>
<p>was from home, the presumption is that he had no knowledge of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ; although his wife Sempronia was an accomplice.
</p>
<p>C.
</p>
<p>Caesar, C. Julius. Son of Caius Caesar, and Aurelia the daughter of
</p>
<p>Cott*. He was born in the sixth consulship of Marius, B. C. 99. When
</p>
<p>only in his seventeenth year, he obtained the office of Flamen Dialis or
</p>
<p>High-priest of Jupiter. His marriage with Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna,
</p>
<p>excited against him the hatred of Sylla, whose suspicion he had previously
</p>
<p>incurred from his aunt Julia's being the wife of Marius. He with difficulty
</p>
<p>escaped assassination, and it was only at the intercession of the vestal
</p>
<p>virgins, and in consequence of the entreaties of his relations, that Sylla
</p>
<p>spared his life. The latter, indeed, had the discernment to behold in
</p>
<p>him, even when a mere youth, the germes of future talent and ambition,
</p>
<p>and when he was asked by his friends why he was so anxious to put a
</p>
<p>mere boy to death, his answer was, " In that boy, I see many Mariuses." 
</p>
<p>Of the eventful life of this eminent Roman, it will only be necessary here
</p>
<p>to speak so far as it was connected with the conspiracy of Catiline. His
</p>
<p>principal aim, in the accomplishment of his ambitious schemes, was to
</p>
<p>gain the favour of the populace, and weaken the power of the nobility.
</p>
<p>This brought him at once in contact with Catiline, and, in favouring the
</p>
<p>views of that daring conspirator, his object was to destroy by these
</p>
<p>means the liberty of his country, and then to crush the conspirators
</p>
<p>themselves, and make himself master of Rome. The opinion which
</p>
<p>he gave in the senate, with respect to the punishment of Lentulus,

<p>Catilina, L. Sergius. A Roman of patrician rank, and the last of
</p>
<p>the gens Screw. Of his father and grandfather little is known. The
</p>
<p>former would seem to have been in indigent circumstances, from the
</p>
<p>language of Quintus Cicero, (de Pet. Cans. c. 2,) who speaks of Cati-
</p>
<p>line, as having been born amid the poverty of his father. The great
</p>
<p>grandfather, M. Sergius Silus, or Silo, distinguished himself greatly in
</p>
<p>the second Punic war, and was present in the battles of Ticinus, Trebia,
</p>
<p>Trasvmenus, and Cannae. Pliny (H. N. 7, 29) speaks of his exploits
</p>
<p>in a very animated strain.  The cruelty of Catiline's disposition, his un-
</p>
<p>daunted resolution, and the depravity of his morals, fitted him for acting
</p>
<p>a distinguished part in the turbulent and bloody scenes of the period in
</p>
<p>which he lived. He embraced the interests of Sylla, in whose army he
</p>
<p>held the office of quaestor. That monster, in his victory, had in Catiline

<p>bounds. He rejoiced in the carnage and plunder of the proscribed, grat-
</p>
<p>ifying at one time his own private resentments, by bringing his enemies
</p>
<p>to punishment, and executing at another the bloody mandates of the
</p>
<p>dictator himself. Many citizens of noble birth are said to have fallen
</p>
<p>by his hand, and, according to Plutarch, (Fit. Syll. c. 32.  Fit C\c.
</p>
<p>c. 10,) he had assassinated his own brother during the civil war, and
</p>
<p>now, to screen himself from prosecution, persuaded Sylla to put him
</p>
<p>down among the proscribed, as a person still alive. He murdered, too,
</p>
<p>with his own hands, his sister's husband, a Roman knight, of a mild and
</p>
<p>peaceable character. One of the most horrid actions, however, of whicb
</p>
<p>he was guilty, would seem to have been the killing of M. Marius Grati-
</p>
<p>dianus, a near relation of the celebrated Marius. Sylla had put the name
</p>
<p>of this individual on the list of the proscribed, whereupon Catiline en-
</p>
<p>tered the dwelling of the unfortunate man, exhausted upon his person
</p>
<p>all the refinements of cruelty and insult, and having at length put an end
</p>
<p>to his existence, carried his bloody head in triumph through the streets
</p>
<p>of Rome, and brought \l to Sylla, as he sat on his tribunal in the forum.
</p>
<p>When this was done, the murderer washed his hands in the lustral water
</p>
<p>at the door of Apollov vhich stood in the immediate vicinity. 
</p>
<p>Catiline was peculiarly dangerous and formidable, as his power of dis-
</p>
<p>simulation enabled him to throw a veil over his 9odl was his
</p>
<p>art, tin was poisoning the minds of the Roman youth, he gained

<p>the friendship and esteem of the severe Catulus. The remainder of his

<p>Cato, M. Porciub, iurnamed Uticensis, on account of his having de-

<p>stroyed himself at Utica, was the great grandson of Cato the Censor.
</p>
<p>His parents died when he was v. - educated under
</p>
<p>the roof of his mother's brother, Livius Drusus. He was austere in his
</p>
<p>morals, a strict follower of the tenets of the Stoic sect ; and so p
</p>
<p>lover of what was virtuous and right, as to pursue every object of such a
</p>
<p>nature with umi< radiness, regardless of the difficulties which
</p>
<p>he might have to encounter, or of the dangers to which he might be ex-
</p>
<p>posed. Cato exerted himself, though in vain, to stem the torrent of

</p>
<p>Roman luxury and corruption, and in his own person he copied the sim-
</p>
<p>plicity of earlier days. He often appeared barefooted in public, and
</p>
<p>never travelled but on foot. In whatever oiUce he was employed, he
</p>
<p>aiw ays reformed its abuses, and restored the ancient regulations. To the
</p>
<p>qualities of a virtuous man, and the rectitude of a stern patriot, Cato
</p>
<p>added the intrepidity of a brave soldier and the talents of an able general.
</p>
<p>In the affair of the conspiracy, he gave Cicero his constant and vigorous
</p>
<p>support, and it was chierly through his efforts, in opposition to those of
</p>
<p>Caesar, that the accomplices of Catiline were capitally punished. This
</p>
<p>virtuous Roman put an end tu his existence at Utica, after the defeat of
</p>
<p>Juba and Scipio by Cat sar, in the battle of Thapsus.
</p>
<p>CatClus, Q. Lutatius. A noble Roman, conspicuous both for
</p>
<p>his love of country and his private virtues. He was the colleague of
</p>
<p>Marius in the consulship when the Cimbri and Teutones came
</p>
<p>upon the south of Europe, and was engaged with that commander in
</p>
<p>the bloodv battle of the Raudii Campi, where the Cimbri were so sig-
</p>
<p>nally defeated by the Romans. We afterwards rind him censor with
</p>
<p>Crassus ; and, Subsequently to this, opposing attempt to make
</p>
<p>Egypt tributary. Catulus ^ as in politics on the aristocratic side, and

</p>
<p>of course a warm opponent of Julius Caesar. He was competitor also
</p>
<p>with the latter for the office of pontifex, but unsuccessful in his applica-
</p>
<p>tion. At a later period he obtained the consulship along with M.
</p>
<p>Aemilius Lepidus, B. C. 80, and ten years after this he dedicated the
</p>
<p>temple of Jupiter in the capitol, which had been destroyed by fire. The
</p>
<p>character of Catulus stood deservedly high. A stranger to flattery and
</p>
<p>adulation, he reproved with equal openness the levity of the multitude,
</p>
<p>and the misconduct of the senate. An anecdote is related of him by
</p>
<p>Plutarch, which proves conclusively the estimation in which he was held.
</p>
<p>When it was proposed to invest Pompey with extraordinary power, under
</p>
<p>the Manilian law, for the suppression of the pirates, Catulus opposed the
</p>
<p>step, and one of his arguments was, that the people ought not to expose
</p>
<p>such a man to so many dangers as he was likely to incur in this new
</p>
<p>command, " for," added he, " what other will you have if you lose him ! w
</p>
<p>With one voice the assembled people exclaimed, "Yourself." After a
</p>
<p>long life of honourable usefulness, Catulus was compelled to put an end
</p>
<p>to his days, by order of the sanguinary Marius. In order to effect this,
</p>
<p>he shut himself up in a narrow chamber, newly plastered, and suffocated
</p>
<p>himself by the vapour produced bv a large fire.
</p>
<p>Cethegus, C. Cornelius. A Roman of corrupt morals and turbulent
</p>
<p>character. He filled, at one time, the office of tribune, and was also a
</p>
<p>warm partisan of Sylla, after having originally sided with Marius. Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently, however, losing the influence which he had possessed, he
</p>
<p>joined in the conspiracy of Catiline. Cicero informs us, that in rash-
</p>
<p>ness and daring he surpassed Catiline himself, and almost equalled him
</p>
<p>in strength of body, love of arms, and dignity of birth. In arranging
</p>
<p>the details of the plot, the conspirators assigned to Cethegus the task of
</p>
<p>posting himself at the door of Cicero's bouse, and, after he had forced
</p>
<p>an entrance, of murdering that illustrious Roman. The vigilance of Cicero
</p>
<p>frustrated this design. Cethegus was apprehended along with Lentulus
</p>
<p>and the rest, and strangled in prison.
</p>
<p>Cicero, M. Tullius. An eminent and well-known Roman, born at
</p>
<p>Arpinum, a town cf the Volsci, in Latium, B. C. 107. His father

</p>
<p>although of equestrian rank, had never enjoyed any curule office, and,
</p>
<p>on that account, Cicero frequently calls himself " a new man," (novus
</p>
<p>homoy) as having been the first of his family who had raised himself to
</p>
<p>such a magistracy. After a careful education, in the completion of
</p>
<p>which he travelled over many parts of Greece, Cicero entered on the
</p>
<p>career of office, and it was bis peculiar boast, to have obtained each pre-
</p>
<p>ferment in succession in its own proper year, or, in other words, as soon
</p>
<p>as he was eligible to it. Thus, he obtained the quaestorship at thirty-
</p>
<p>one years of age, the aedileship at thirty-seven, the praetorship at forty,
</p>
<p>and the consulship at forty-three. Our limits will compel us to confine
</p>
<p>ourselves merely to that part of Cicero's history which was connected with
</p>
<p>the conspiracy of Catiline, and only to so much even of this as Sallust
</p>
<p>himself has not touched upon. It was a master stroke of policy on the
</p>
<p>part of Cicero to drive Catiline out of Rome, and force him, as it were,
</p>
<p>into a rebellion before it was ripe, in the hope, that, by carrying out with
</p>
<p>him his accomplices, he would clear the city at once of the whole faction ;
</p>
<p>or, by leaving them behind, without his counsels to guide them, would
</p>
<p>expose them to sure destruction by their own rashness and folly. For
</p>
<p>Catiline's chief trust was not on the open force which he had provided

</p>
<p>for the field, but on the success of his secret machination* at Rome, and
</p>
<p>on making himself master of the city.  While the sense cf all his im-
</p>
<p>portant services was still fresh, Cicero was repaid with the most ample
</p>
<p>honours. L. Gellius, moreover, who had been consul and censor, said
</p>
<p>in a speech to the senate, that the republic owed him a civic crown,
</p>
<p>" for having saved them all from ruin/' and Catulus, in a fjll house, de-
</p>
<p>clared him " the father of his country," as Cato did likewise from the
</p>
<p>rostra, with the loud acclamations of the whole people. Party feelings,
</p>
<p>however, eventually gained the ascendency, and the very man who had
</p>
<p>been thus idolized was impeached for putting citizens to death without
</p>
<p>the formality of a trial, and was compelled to yield to the coming storm,
</p>
<p>and retire into voluntary banishment. The individual most active against
</p>
<p>him was Publius Clodius. The charge against him had reference to the

<p>Cornificius, Q. A Roman, to whose custody Cethegus was com-
</p>
<p>mitted, before he suffered punishment.
</p>
<p>Crassus, M. Licinius. A celebrated Roman, surnamed the " Rich,"
</p>
<p>on account of his great opulence. At first he was very circumscribed in
</p>
<p>his circumstances, but by educating slaves, and selling them for a high
</p>
<p>price, he soon enriched himself. Crassus distinguished himself in the
</p>
<p>war against Spartacus, by defeating that gladiator and killing 12000 of
</p>
<p>his followers. After this, he was chosen consul with Pompey, and, after
</p>
<p>the consulship, obtained the office of censor. His supposed participation
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy of Catiline was probably without any foundation in
</p>
<p>truth. What purpose could Crassus, in fact, propose to himself by en-
</p>
<p>tering into a plot to burn a city, in which his own property was so consid-
</p>
<p>erable ? The enmity which arose between Cicero and Crassus, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the alleged guilt of the latter, was so bitter, that, according
</p>
<p>to Plutarch, it would have shown itself by some act of violence on the
</p>
<p>part of Crassus, had not his son Publius, who was very intimate with
</p>
<p>Cicero, prevented him. He even prevailed on his father, eventually, to
</p>
<p>become reconciled to the orator. Crassus became afterwards a member
</p>
<p>of the first triumvirate ; and, obtaining Syria for his province, marched
</p>
<p>against the Parthians, by whom he was defeated and slain.

</p>
<p>with whom he was intimate. Fulvia communicated the danger which
</p>
<p>threatened the tUte and the lives of the citizens ; and the alarm which
</p>
<p>this occasioned caused the election of Cicero to the consulship. Cicero
</p>
<p>subsequently prevailed upon Curius, through the means of Fulvia, to
</p>
<p>discover to him all the movement* of Catiline, and was thus enabled to
</p>
<p>batil- In return for these services, rewards were voted
</p>
<p>him from the public funds ; but Caesar, whom Curius had named among
</p>
<p>the conspirators, exerted himself against the fulfilment of the public
</p>
<p>promise, and the rewards were not given.

<p>Italy, and had thus, by degrees, accomplished the removal of the com-

<p>mon people from their possessions. This abuse stimulated Tiberius
</p>
<p>Gracchus to revive the Licinian law, by which no one could hold more
</p>
<p>than 500 jugera, or about 350 acres of land. The owners, however,
</p>
<p>were to be indemnified for the land they had thus lost. The attempts
</p>
<p>of the Gracchi cost them their lives. Tiberius was slain in a collision
</p>
<p>between his adherents and the party of the nobility headed by Scipio

<p>Nasica. Caius was slain some years afterwards by the consul Opimius

<p>and his party.

<p>ceived a third of the kingdom, on the death of his father. (Eptt. 50.)
</p>
<p>Sallust, however, states, that both Gulussa and Mastanabal were cut
</p>
<p>off by disease, before their father died ; and that Micipsa, the remaining
</p>
<p>brother, on the demise of his father, succeeded to the whole kingdom.

</p>
<p>house, just before the discoverv of the conspiracy. He was a descendant
</p>
<p>of M. Porcius Laeca, tribune of the commons, who had the law carried

</p>
<p>substituting, for capital punishment, banishment and confiscation of

</p>
<p>band, M. Antonius Creticus, to whom she had born M. Antonius, the
</p>
<p>triumvir. Lentulus was a man of talents, but extremely corrupt in his
</p>
<p>private character. The interest of his family, and the affability of his
</p>
<p>manners, proceeding from a love of popularity, raised him through the

<p>torship, the usual step for being ajrain restored to that body, when
</p>
<p>Catiline formed his design of subverting the government. Poverty, the
</p>
<p>natural consequence of excessive dissipation, added to immoderate vanity
</p>
<p>and extravagant ambition, induced him to join in the conspiracy. The
</p>
<p>soothsayers easily persuaded him that he was the third of the gens Cor-
</p>
<p>nelia, destined by the fates to enjoy the supreme power at Rome. L.
</p>
<p>Cornelius Cinna, and L. Cornelius Sylla, had both attained to that ele-
</p>
<p>vation. His schemes, however, all proved abortive, and he was strangled

</p>
<p>informs us, that he received the surnan in consequence of his

<p>having wasted a large sum of the publi< under

<p>Manlius, If. A Roman commander, who held the consulship with
</p>
<p>P. Rutilius Rums, B. C. 107. He was defeated by the Gauls that same
</p>
<p>year. Cicero (Pro Plane. 5) calls him Cn. Manlius, and Eutiopius (5. 1)
</p>
<p>Manius Manilius.
</p>
<p>Manlius Torquatus, L. A Roman commander, who held the con-
</p>
<p>sulship with L. Aurelius CoHa, 67 B. C. He was the particular friend
</p>
<p>of Cicero, who mentions him in terms of high approbation in his letters.
</p>
<p>Sallust calls him L. Torquatus.

<p>Makcicjs Rex, Q. Consul with L. Caecilius Metellus, B. C. 80.
</p>
<p>"When Catiline, five years after, formed his conspiracy, Q. Marcius Rex
</p>
<p>was sent to Faesulae, to levy troops, and adopt such other measures as
</p>
<p>he might deem proper. He had just returned from a military com-
</p>
<p>mand, had demanded a triumph, and met with opposition from a few
</p>
<p>unprincipled men in the senate. The Marcian family claimed descent
</p>
<p>from Ancus Marcius, and hence the name Marcius Rex.
</p>
<p>is, C. A native of Arpinum, remarkable for his military talents,
</p>
<p>but still more for his cruel and vindictive disposition. Having preserved
</p>
<p>the state by his bravery, he afterwards brought it to the brink of ruin by
</p>
<p>his reckless and uncompromising violence. In early life, he was a
</p>
<p>ploughman, and wrought for hire. Quitting that employment, he entered
</p>
<p>the ranks of the army, and distinguished himself under Scipio at the
</p>
<p>siege and capture of N'uinantia. From the condition of a common sol-
</p>
<p>dier, be gradually rose to the command of the Roman army, and to the
</p>
<p>office of consul. After bringing the war with Jugurtha to a close, he
</p>
<p>ed in two terrible encounters the Teutones and Cimbri, slaving
</p>
<p>an immense number, and taking a vast multitude prisoners. After these
</p>
<p>signal victories, his ambition- .-ought him in collision with Sylla,
</p>
<p>and a desolating civil war was the consequence. To crush the power
</p>
<p>of his rival, Sylla marched the troops which he had raised to carry on
</p>
<p>the war with Mithridates to Rome, and compelled Marius to flee. In

<p>his banishment he underwent uncommon hardships, from which he was
</p>
<p>in the end released by Cinna's embracing his interests. He then re-
</p>
<p>turned to Rome to satiate his inhuman resentment, and butchered many
</p>
<p>thousands of the citizens. Tired at last with murder and assassination,
</p>
<p>he and Cinna appointed themselves consuls. But Marius, worn out by
</p>
<p>infirmrl lit intoxication, to which he probably had
</p>
<p>recourse to blunt the stings of a guilty conscience, died on the first day

<p>of his beintz invested with the consulship for the seventh time.

<p>Massixissa. Son of Gala, king of the Massyli, in Numidia. He was
</p>
<p>brought up at Carthage, where he contracted friendships with the nobles,
</p>
<p>and embraced the interests of the state. As an ally of the Carthaginians,
</p>
<p>he waged a successful war against Svphax. He afterwards crossed
</p>
<p>over into Spain, still on the side of Carthage, and distinguished himself
</p>
<p>by his braven*, activity, and military skill. After Scipio, surnamed
</p>
<p>Africanus Major, had defeated Asdrubal in this country, he found, among
</p>
<p>the prisoners of war, one of the nephews of Marsinissa. The Roman
</p>
<p>commander sent this relative, loaded with presents, to his uncle, and
</p>
<p>gave him an escort for the safety of his person. Struck by this act of

<p>generosity, Massmissa forgot all former feelings of hostility, and joined

<p>his forces to those of Scipio. From this time, he continued a firm and
</p>
<p>faithful ally to his new friends, and it was to his exertions that the Romans
</p>
<p>O'ved many of their victories in Africa, and particularly the one which
</p>
<p>proved so fatal to Asdrubal and Syphax. In the battle of Zama also,
</p>
<p>Massinissa greatly contributed to the overthrow of Hannibal, and the
</p>
<p>Romans rewarded his fidelity by large accessions of territory. He at-
</p>
<p>tained to an advanced age, in the enjoyment of excellent health, and, on
</p>
<p>his death, left his kingdom to be divided by the younger Scipio among
</p>
<p>his three sons, Micipsa, Gulussa, and Manastabal. One circumstance in
</p>
<p>the life of M m worthy of particular attention from its tragical
</p>
<p>nature. He had become possessed of Sophonisba, the captive wife of
</p>
<p>Syphax, to whom he had D* d in earlier davs, and having car-
</p>
<p>ried her to his camp, he married her. But this step displeasing the
