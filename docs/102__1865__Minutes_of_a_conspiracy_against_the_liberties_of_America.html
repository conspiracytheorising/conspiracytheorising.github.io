<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>ONGRESS, I doubt not, will have heard
</p>
<p>of the plot that was forming among
</p>
<p>many difaffected perfons in this city and
</p>
<p>government for aiding the King's troops
</p>
<p>upon their arrival. No regular plan feems to
</p>
<p>have been digefted ; but feveral perfons have
</p>
<p>been enlifted and fworn to join them. The
</p>
<p>matter, I am in hopes, by a timely difcovery, will be
</p>
<p>fupprefled and put a flop to. Many citizens and
</p>
<p>others, among whom is the mayor, are now in con-
</p>
<p>finement. The matter has been traced up to Governor
</p>
<p>Tryon ; and the mayor appears to have been a princi-
</p>
<p>pal agent between him and the perfons concerned in it.
</p>
<p>The plot had been communicated to fome of the
</p>
<p>army, and part of my guard engaged in it. Thomas
</p>
<p>Hickey, one of them, has been tried, and by the

<p>unanimous
</p>
<p>( vi )
</p>
<p>unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is fentenced to
</p>
<p>die, having enlifted himfelf, and engaged others. The
</p>
<p>fentence, by the order of the whole council of general
</p>
<p>officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock. The others are not tried. I am hopeful
</p>
<p>this example will produce many falutary confequences,
</p>
<p>and deter others from entering into the like traitorous
</p>
<p>practices. " l
</p>
<p>So, on the 28th June, 1776, wrote Wafhington to
</p>
<p>the Prefident of the Congrefs, then fitting at Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, reflecting a confpiracy, whofe flory is thus
</p>
<p>related by the lateft of his biographers :
</p>
<p>"The wildefl reports," fays Wafhington Irving,
</p>
<p>"were in circulation concerning it. Some of the Tories
</p>
<p>were to break down King's Bridge, others were to
</p>
<p>blow up the magazines, fpike the guns, and mafTacre
</p>
<p>all the field-officers. Wafhington was to be killed or
</p>
<p>delivered up to the enemy. Some of his own body-
</p>
<p>guard were faid to be in the plot.
</p>
<p>Several publicans in the city were pointed out, as
</p>
<p>having aided or abetted the plot. One was landlord
</p>
<p>of the Highlander, at the corner of Beaver Street and
</p>
<p>Broadway. Another difpenfed liquor under the fign
</p>
<p>of Robin Hood. Another named Lowry, defcribed
</p>

<p>as a " fat man in a blue coat," kept tavern in a low
</p>
<p>houfe oppoiite the Ofwego market. Another, James
</p>
<p>Houlding, kept a beer houfe in Tryon Row, oppoiite
</p>
<p>the gates of the upper barracks. It would feem as if
</p>
<p>a net work of corruption and treachery had been
</p>
<p>woven throughout the city by means of thefe liquor
</p>
<p>dealers. One of the moil noted, however, was Corbie,
</p>
<p>whofe tavern was faid to be " to the fouth-eail of
</p>
<p>General Waihington's houfe, to the weftward of
</p>
<p>Bayard's Woods, and north of Lifpenard's Meadows,"
</p>
<p>from which it would appear that, at that time, the
</p>
<p>general was quartered at what was formerly called
</p>
<p>Richmond Hill; a maniion furrounded by trees, at a
</p>
<p>ihort diilance from the city, in rather an ifolated iitua-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>A committee of the New York Congrefs, of which
</p>
<p>John Jay was chairman, traced the plot up to Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Tryon, who, from his fafe retreat on ihip-
</p>
<p>board, acted through agents on fhore. The moil im-
</p>
<p>portant of thefe was David Matthews, the tory mayor
</p>
<p>of the city. He was accufed of diiburiing money to
</p>
<p>enliil men, purchafe arms, and corrupt the foldiery.
</p>
<p>Wafhington was authorized and requeiled by the
</p>
<p>committee to caufe the mayor to be apprehended, and
</p>
<p>all his papers fecured. Matthews was at that time

<p>reiiding
</p>
<p>( viii )
</p>
<p>refiding at Flatbufh, on Long Ifland, at no great dif-
</p>
<p>tance from General Greene's encampment. Wafhing-
</p>
<p>ton tranfmitted the warrant of the committee to the
</p>
<p>general on the 21ft, with directions that it mould " be
</p>
<p>executed with precifion, and exactly by one o'clock
</p>
<p>of the enfuing morning, by a careful officer."
</p>
<p>Precifely at the hour of one, a detachment from
</p>
<p>Greene's brigade furrounded the houfe of the mayor,
</p>
<p>and fecured his perfon ; but no papers were found,
</p>
<p>though diligent fearch was made.
</p>
<p>Numerous other arrefts took place, and among the
</p>
<p>\ number fome of Wafhington's body-guard. A great
</p>
<p>difmay fell upon the tories. Some of thofe on Long
</p>
<p>Ifland, who had proceeded to arm themfelves, finding
</p>
<p>the plot difcovered, fought refuge in woods and rao-
</p>
<p>rafTes. Wafhington directed that thofe arrefted, who
</p>
<p>belonged to the army, mould be tried by a court-
</p>
<p>martial, and the reft handed over to the fecular power.
</p>
<p>According to ftatements made before the committee,
</p>
<p>five guineas bounty was offered by Governor Tryon
</p>
<p>to each man who mould enter the King's fervice ; with
</p>
<p>a promife of two hundred acres of land for himfelf,
</p>
<p>one hundred for his wife, and fifty for each child.
</p>
<p>The men thus recruited were to act on more, in co-
</p>
<p>operation with the King's troops when they came.

<p>Corbie's
</p>
<p>( ix )
</p>
<p>Corbie's tavern, near Wafhington's quarters, was a
</p>
<p>kind of rendezvous of the confpirators. There one
</p>
<p>Gilbert Forbes, a gunfmith, "a fhort, thick man,
</p>
<p>with a white coat," enlifted men, gave them money,
</p>
<p>and " fwore them on the book to fecrecy." From
</p>
<p>this houfe a correfpondence was kept up with Governor
</p>
<p>Tryon on fhipboard, through a " mulatto-colored
</p>
<p>negro, dreffed in blue clothes." At this tavern it was
</p>
<p>fuppofed Wafhington's body-guards were tampered
</p>
<p>with. Thomas Hickey, one of the guards, a dark-
</p>
<p>complexioned man, five feet fix inches high, and well,
</p>
<p>set, was faid not only to be enlifted, but to have aided
</p>
<p>in corrupting his comrades ; among others, Greene the
</p>
<p>drummer, and Johnfon the fifer.
</p>
<p>It was further teftified before the committee, that
</p>
<p>one Sergeant Graham, an old foldier, formerly of the
</p>
<p>royal artillery, had been employed by Governor
</p>
<p>Tryon to prowl around and furvey the grounds and
</p>
<p>works about the city, and on Long Ifland, and that,
</p>
<p>on information thus procured, a plan of operations
</p>
<p>had been concerted. On the arrival of the fleet, a
</p>
<p>man-of-war mould cannonade the battery at Red
</p>
<p>Hook; while that was doing, a detachment of the
</p>
<p>army mould land below with cannon, and by a circuit-
</p>
<p>ous march furprife and ftorm the works on Long-

</p>
<p>Ifland. The fhipping, then, with the remainder of the
</p>
<p>army, were to divide, one part to run up the Hudfon
</p>
<p>the other up the Eaft River ; troops were to land
</p>
<p>above New York, fecure the pafs at King's Bridge, and
</p>
<p>cut offall communication between the city and country. 1
</p>
<p>Much of the evidence given was of a dubious kind.
</p>
<p>It was certain that perfons had fecretly been enlifted,
</p>
<p>and fworn to hoftile operations, but Wafhington did
</p>
<p>not think that any regular plan had been digefted by
</p>
<p>the confpirators. "The matter," wrote he, "I am
</p>
<p>in hopes, by a timely difcovery, will be suppreffed. 2
</p>
<p>According to the mayor's own admiffion before the
</p>
<p>committee, he had been cognizant of attempts to enlift
</p>
<p>tories and corrupt Wafhington's guards, though he
</p>
<p>declared that he had difcountenanced them. He had
</p>
<p>on one occafion, alfo, at the requeft of Governor
</p>
<p>Tryon, paid money for him to Gilbert Forbes, the
</p>
<p>gunfmith, for rifles and round bored guns which he
</p>
<p>had already furnifhed, and for others which he was to
</p>
<p>make. He had done fo, however (according to his
</p>
<p>account), with great reluctance, and after much hefita-
</p>
<p>tion and delay, warning the gunfmith that he would
</p>
<p>be hanged if found out. The mayor with a number
</p>
<p>of others, were detained in prifon to await a trial.

<p>2 Wafhington to the Prefidcnt of Congrefs, June 28.
</p>
<p>( *i )
</p>
<p>Thomas Hickey, the individual of Wafhington's
</p>
<p>guard, was tried before a court-martial. He was an
</p>
<p>Irifhman, and had been a deferter from the Britifh
</p>
<p>army. The court-martial found him guilty of mutiny
</p>
<p>and fedition, and treacherous correfpondence with the
</p>
<p>enemy, and fentenced him to be hanged.
</p>
<p>The fentence was approved by Wafhington, and
</p>
<p>was carried promptly into effect, in the mod folemn
</p>
<p>and impreffive manner, to ferve as a warning and ex-
</p>
<p>ample in this time of treachery and danger. On the
</p>
<p>morning of the 28th, all the officers and men off duty,
</p>
<p>belonging to the brigades of Heath, Spencer, Stirling
</p>
<p>and Scott, affembled under arms at their refpeclive
</p>
<p>parades at 10 o'clock, and marched thence to the
</p>
<p>ground. Twenty men from each brigade, with bayo-
</p>
<p>nets fixed, guarded the prifoner to the place of execu-
</p>
<p>tion, which was a field near the Bowery Lane. There
</p>
<p>he was hanged in the prefence, we are told, of near
</p>
<p>twenty thoufand perfons. *
</p>
<p>While the city was ftill brooding over this doleful
</p>
<p>fpectacle, four mips of war, portentous vifitants, ap-
</p>
<p>appeared off the Hook, flood quietly in at the Nar-
</p>
<p>rows, and dropped anchor in the bay.
</p>
<p>In his orderly book, Wafhington expreffed a hope
</p>
<p>that the unhappy fate of Thomas Hickey, executed

</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>()
</p>
<p>that day for mutiny, fedition and treachery, would be
</p>
<p>a warning to every foldier in the line, to avoid the
</p>
<p>crimes for which he fuffered."
</p>
<p>Mr. Irving then adds the following note: "As a
</p>
<p>fpecimen of the reports which circulated throughout
</p>
<p>the country, concerning this confpiracy, we give an
</p>
<p>extract from a letter, written from Wethersfleld, in
</p>
<p>Connecticut, 9th of July, 17^6, by the Reverend
</p>
<p>John Marfh.
</p>
<p>"You have heard of the infernal plot that has been
</p>
<p>difcovered. About ten days before any of the con-
</p>
<p>fpirators were taken up, a woman went to the general
</p>
<p>and defired a private audience. He granted it to her,
</p>
<p>and fhe let him know that his life was in danger, and
</p>
<p>gave him fuch an account of the confpiracy as gained
</p>
<p>his confidence. He opened the matter to a few
</p>
<p>friends, on whom he could depend. A ftrict watch
</p>
<p>was kept night and day, until a favorable opportunity
</p>
<p>occurred ; when the general went to bed as ufual, arofe
</p>
<p>about two o'clock, told his lady he was a going, with
</p>
<p>fome of the Provincial Congrefs, to order fome tories

<p>inftruments to break open houfes, and before fix
</p>
<p>o'clock next morning, had forty men under guard at
</p>
<p>the City Hall, among whom was the mayor of the
</p>
<p>city, feveral merchants, and five or fix of his own
</p>
<p>life-guard. Upon examination, one Forbes confefled
</p>
<p>that the plan was to afTaffinate the general, and as
</p>
<p>many of the fuperior officers as they could, and to
</p>
<p>blow up the magazine upon the appearance of the
</p>
<p>enemy's fleet, and to go off in boats prepared for that
</p>
<p>purpofe to join the enemy. Thos. Hickey, who has
</p>
<p>been executed, went from this place. He came from
</p>
<p>Ireland a few years ago. What will be done with the
</p>
<p>mayor is uncertain. He can't be tried by court-
</p>
<p>martial, and it is faid, there is no law of that colony
</p>
<p>by which he can be condemned. May he have his

<p>"VY7HILE the city of New- York was

<p>* * in the pofTeffion of the American
</p>
<p>army, great numbers of the inhabit-
</p>
<p>ants were feized, accufed of being con-
</p>
<p>cerned in a confpiracy, and fent prifoners
</p>
<p>into Connecticut. Some were brought
</p>
<p>to a trial, found guilty, and condemned
</p>
<p>as traitors. Great difcoveries, it was faid,
</p>
<p>were made of plots againft the congrefs.
</p>
<p>But the trial of the culprits was managed
</p>
<p>with fo much fecrecy that nothing of con-
</p>

<p>induced to believe, that it was an artful

<p>fcheme of the congrefs and committee to
</p>
<p>punifh their internal enemies, or prevent
</p>
<p>them from doing mifchief, without alarm-
</p>
<p>ing the body of the people.
</p>
<p>The following minutes throw much
</p>
<p>light on the affair. They were difcovered
</p>
<p>(on the late capture of New- York by the
</p>
<p>Britifh troops) among the papers of a
</p>
<p>perfon who appears to have been fecretary

<p>to the committee. They will furnifh
</p>
<p>entertainment to thofe who wifh to know
</p>
<p>the particulars of this myfterious tranf-
</p>
<p>action.

</p>
<p>ILLIAM COLLIER (waiter at the Serjeant's
</p>
<p>Arms Tavern, kept by Alexander Sinclair,
</p>
<p>near the old Barracks) waited upon Jofeph Smith,
</p>
<p>Efq., in the city, and informed him, that he had fome
</p>
<p>affairs of great importance to communicate to him if
</p>
<p>he could depend upon being fecured himfelf from
</p>
<p>danger. Upon which Mr. Smith gave him all poffible
</p>
<p>affurances, that fo far from being punifhed, he mould
</p>
<p>be considerably rewarded if his difcoveries were of any
</p>
<p>importance. Encouraged by this, he faid, that a
</p>
<p>number of the inhabitants of the city had met for
</p>
<p>many months at the houfe aforefaid, that having heard
</p>
<p>them during his attendance fpeak very often difrefpect-
</p>
<p>ful of the congrefs, and perceiving them very much
</p>
<p>engaged in writing letters, and remarking that they
</p>
<p>always fufpended their converfation or fpoke refervedly
</p>
<p>when he was prefent, his fufpicions were excited that
</p>
<p>they did not meet merely for entertainment. On

<p>which

</p>
<p>which he concealed himfelf in an adjoining chamber,
</p>
<p>and, among other things, heard them fpeak of an
</p>
<p>engagement which had been entered into in that and
</p>
<p>the neighboring province to free themfelves from what
</p>
<p>they called the damnable oppreflion of the congrefs ;
</p>
<p>that he underftood from their converfation, that arms
</p>
<p>were diftributed among their partizans, and that a
</p>
<p>correfpondence was eftablifhed between them and the
</p>
<p>army, and that they had formed a defign of riflng and
</p>
<p>making themfelves matters of fome of the principal
</p>
<p>perfons in the army of the American States, and efcap-
</p>
<p>ing to Staten Ifland ; that he learned from their con-
</p>
<p>verfation, that a correfpondence for this purpofe had
</p>
<p>been kept up between them, and certain perfons in the
</p>
<p>Britifh fervice, to whom they gave information of the
</p>
<p>ftate of affairs amongft us, and from whom they re-
</p>
<p>ceived council and money for the better execution of
</p>
<p>their defigns. Mr. Smith questioned him concerning
</p>
<p>the names of the perfons who met at his mailer's
</p>
<p>houfe, and learned from him, that Mr. Forbes, Garri-
</p>
<p>fon, Cockfhall, Burke, and Sebring, were the moll
</p>
<p>active perfons. The provincial congrefs on receiving
</p>
<p>this information from Mr. Smith, being determined
</p>
<p>to proceed with the utmoft caution, ordered a party
</p>
<p>of men the next night to feize Mr. Gilbert Forbes,
</p>
<p>Gunfmith, and to convey him to fafe cuftody ; accord-
</p>
<p>ingly a party under the command of Capt. Labatteau
</p>
<p>proceeded about two in the morning to the houfe of
</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes, in the Broad-way ; fome of them having
</p>
<p>forced their way into the yard to prevent him making

</p>
<p>his efcape, the Captain knocked at the front door, and
</p>
<p>demanded admittance, on its being opened, and find-
</p>
<p>ing the culprit was in an upper room in bed, rufhed
</p>
<p>up flairs, broke open the door, and feized him before
</p>
<p>he could meditate an efcape. They then required his
</p>
<p>keys, which, after fome hefitation, he delivered upon
</p>
<p>being told that what they did was by the order of the
</p>
<p>provincial congrefs ; they then conveyed him to an
</p>
<p>apartment in the New Goal, where he was properly
</p>
<p>fecured. His papers were delivered to the provincial
</p>
<p>congrefs, which met the next day, among which were
</p>
<p>many letters and minutes which threw great light on
</p>
<p>the defigns of the confpirators. The following among
</p>
<p>many other interesting ones were read at the board :

</p>
<p>" My dear Friend,
</p>
<p>" Our good caufe thrives mod wonderfully and pro-
</p>
<p>videntially hereabouts. We have great hopes that
</p>
<p>the tyranny of our cruel tafk- matters will foon be
</p>
<p>ended. The little finger of thefe defpots is heavier
</p>
<p>than the loins of the raoft arbitrary miniftry. They
</p>
<p>mew their fuperiority only by their cruelty. The
</p>
<p>people groan under their oppreflions, and comparing
</p>
<p>their prefent mifery with their former happinefs and
</p>
<p>tranquility, long to throw off the yoke. They plunder
</p>
<p>our barns, enter our houfes, and forcibly take from
</p>
<p>us what we have fweated and toiled for ; giving us
</p>
<p>in return nothing but their paltry paper. If we are
</p>
<p>to be flaves, let us be fo to the lion, and not to the
</p>
<p>loufy dirty vermin of New England. We have had
</p>
<p>many meetings lately, and fo many are defirous of
</p>
<p>aflbciating with us, that we are afraid leaft the fecret
</p>
<p>might tranfpire by being communicated to too great a
</p>
<p>number; we have already two hundred aflbciators in
</p>
<p>this county who have bound themfelves by the mod
</p>
<p>folemn afleverations to fidelity; we are much at a lofs
</p>
<p>to know how to act about the oath of allegiance to the
</p>
<p>congrefs, which 'tis faid they intend foon to impofe on
</p>
<p>us. Heaven fend us a fpeedy deliverance. We are
</p>
<p>well fupplied with arms, which every man keeps hid,
</p>
<p>to ufe when occafion permits, but we are in great want
</p>
<p>of powder. The drubbing which they had in Canada
</p>
<p>works wonderfully, and if General Howe mould give
</p>
<p>them one found thrashing, numbers will be ready to

<p>fly to his protection ; depend upon our conftancy and

</p>
<p>many more. I can't help laughing to fee the long
</p>
<p>faces of many of my neighbours on this occafion ; had
</p>
<p>I my wifh their necks mould be as long as their faces :
</p>
<p>by all accounts it has kicked up a devil of an uproar
</p>
<p>at Carpenters hall, and I fuppofe we mail very foon
</p>
<p>have another faft.  faft of the flefh I mean, for their
</p>
<p>pious paftors take care to give the faints on fuch oc-
</p>
<p>cafions a fpiritual feaft of treafon and rebellion. My
</p>
<p>neighbor Voorhuys fays there muft have been treachery
</p>
<p>in the cafe, and thinks that Donald Campbell is a
</p>
<p>very good hand at a retreat. Things go very bravely
</p>
<p>on with us. The old farmers fhake their heads, and
</p>
<p>fay, this is not the thing, we long to fee fome more

<p>Englifh guineas among us. Jabez Fifher and I have
</p>
<p>taken occafion to go much among them, and tell them

<p>the deiigns of the congrefs are all impofition, that they
</p>
<p>never fufFered any thing from England, and that we
</p>
<p>mail never be happy till the old times are reftored,
</p>
<p>that old John Bull is rouzed at laft, and that what
</p>
<p>they thought fear or weaknefs was nothing but mercy
</p>
<p>and gentlenefs. We now meet frequently at each
</p>
<p>others houfes, drink the King on our marrow-bones,

<p>and confufion to the congrefs ; we have fifty names

<p>now down on our affociation paper, all {launch hearty

<p>them. My choler got the better of my prudence, and
</p>
<p>I pufhed him out of my houfe, and fhut the door

<p>told him the property was mine, and would ufe it as I

<p>pleafed ; he made no anfwer, but went away in a paffion,

<p>and foon returned with a party of his myrmidons, who
</p>
<p>infulted me in the grofTeft manner, took away my

<p>poultry, and broke my windows ; I have fince applied

<p>to the committee for redrefs, but could not obtain a

<p>hearing, as I fuppofe they partook of the plunder.

<p>Such is our glorious liberty, or rather the liberty,

<p>which thefe mifcreants take with us. I hope, how-

<p>with a faultering voice begged the committee would

<p>allow him fome time to compofe his mind, and permit

<p>him to have council to aflift him in his defence, as he
</p>
<p>was entirely unprepared to anfwer any queftions, and

<p>might prejudice himfelf by his ignorance of the forms
</p>
<p>ufually practifed in fuch cafes.

<p>you are only concerning matters of fact, and if you

<p>evade, I inform you that your requeft cannot be

<p>Mr. Mulligen. Sir, Sir ! I am furprifed you have

<p>ing mercy, by making an honeft and full confeflion ;

<p>would affift. I faid, aflift, to do what ? they faid, to

<p>murder General Wafhington and all the Livingftons.
</p>
<p>Upon this I faid, that his Excellency was like a faint,
</p>
<p>and the Livingftons, apoftles, who opened the eyes of
</p>
<p>the people in America, and that I fhould be afraid of
</p>
<p>being hanged if I was knowingly to hurt a hair of

<p>their heads ; upon this the Scotchman ihrugged up his

<p>moulders, and all were filent. I was defired to ftep

<p>out, but they foon after called me in again, and one

<p>of them gave me ten dollars to fwear fecrecy, which I
</p>
<p>was then tempted to do, but am now forry for it.

<p>This was the fubftance of the evidence given in by

<p>Mr. Lawrence.

<p>Mr. MacKeflbn then acquainted the committee, that

<p>Did'nt you imagine that was what he meant, when he

<p>The next week Mr. Duryee and Mr. Anthony came

<p>Gibbons was a girl from New Jerfey, of whom General

<p>Wafhington was very fond, that he maintained her
</p>
<p>genteelly at a houfe near Mr. Skinner's,  at the

<p>North River; that he came there very often late at

<p>night in difguife ; he learnt alfo that this woman was

<p>fo he called her, and that fhe told him, Wafhington
</p>
<p>had often faid he wifhed his hands were clear of the
</p>
<p>dirty New-Englanders, and words to that effect.
</p>
<p>Court. Did you hear no mention made of any
</p>
<p>fcheme to betray, or feize him ?
</p>
<p>Cooper. Mr. Clayford faid he could eafily be feized
</p>
<p>and put on board a boat, and carried off, as his female
</p>
<p>friend had promifed fhe would affift : but all prefent
</p>
<p>thought it would be hazardous.

</p>
<p>Savage. I did, and nearly as the laft evidence has
</p>
<p>declared ; the fociety in general refufed to be concerned
</p>
<p>in it, and thought it a mad fcheme.
</p>
<p>Mr. Abeel. Pray, Mr. Savage, have not you heard
</p>
<p>nothing of an information that was to be given to
</p>
<p>Governor Tryon ?
</p>
<p>Savage. Yes ; papers and letters were at different
</p>
<p>times fhewn to the fociety, which were taken out of
</p>
<p>General Wafhington's pockets by Mrs. Gibbons, and
</p>
<p>given (as fhe pretended fome occafion of going out) to
</p>
<p>Mr. Clayford, who always copied them, and they
</p>
<p>were put into his pockets again.
</p>
<p>Court. What was done with thefe papers ?
</p>
<p>Savage. They were read at the table, copied, and
</p>
<p>fent off.
</p>
<p>Court. Where were they fent? and by what convey-
</p>
<p>ance?
</p>
<p>Savage. They were given to Mr. Matthews, who
</p>
<p>fent them on board the Duchefs of Gordon.
</p>
<p>Court. Had they no other accounts but thofe com-
</p>
<p>municated by Mrs. Gibbons.
</p>
<p>Savage. Yes ; many other papers and letters were
</p>
<p>read, and I was told they had information by an
</p>
<p>officer, a gentleman of high rank and diftin&ion, near
</p>
<p>General Wafhington, and in his confidence.
</p>
<p>Court. Could you find out who he was ?
</p>
<p>Anjwer. No.

<p>cated ?

</p>
<p>Court. You cannot give any reafon to fufpect what
</p>
<p>officer it was ?
</p>
<p>Savage. No ; I could not learn who it was ; but
</p>
<p>was often told that he was a gentleman in whom
</p>
<p>General Wafhington placed great confidence, and re-
</p>
<p>lied much upon.
</p>
<p>The Court ordered him to withdraw, and the room
</p>
<p>to be cleared.
</p>
<p>Mr. Livingfton. In my opinion, gentlemen, we
</p>
<p>had better defer examining any more witnefTes till we
</p>
<p>can confult General Wafhington, and fome other
</p>
<p>officers, upon what has appeared.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scott. I think we have no time for delay, we
</p>
<p>may run through an examination of the witnefTes, as
</p>
<p>this court is an independent one, for the good of the
</p>
<p>public, and no time mould be loft in coming at the
</p>
<p>bottom of this horrid affair.
</p>
<p>Court. It would be but juftice to the General, as
</p>
<p>he is fome way affe&ed by the laft witnefTes to apprize
</p>
<p>him of it, and confult with him, in the mean time the
</p>
<p>other fufpe&ed persons mould be feized as fpeedily
</p>
<p>as poflible.
</p>
<p>The court accordingly adjourned till the 26th.
</p>
<p>During this interval the committee had many confer-
</p>
<p>ences on the fubjedt with General Wafhington, and
</p>
<p>many other officers. They had alfo private examina-
</p>
<p>tions of the prifoners. Orders were ifTued to feize the
</p>
<p>perfons of John Wiley, Norman Ptolomy, Totten
</p>
<p>and Crofsfield ; and information being given that a

<p>number of the confpirators were concealed at and near

<p>Jamaica, Long Ifland, a party of horfe were ordered
</p>
<p>to take them, under the command of Capt. Willett.
</p>
<p>When they reached Jamaica, they found the confpira-
</p>
<p>tors, to the number of eighteen, had retired to a wood
</p>
<p>on the top of a hill, determined to defend themfelves.
</p>
<p>Captain Willett got a fmall reinforcement, and then
</p>
<p>furrounded the eminence where they were pofted ; a

<p>brifk fire enfued as our people approached, and they
</p>
<p>obftinately continued to refift, till having loft one man,
</p>
<p>and others being dangeroufly wounded and difabled,
</p>
<p>they thought proper to furrender, and were brought

<p>prifoners to New York.
</p>
<p>June 29. The congrefs taking into ferious confidera-
</p>
<p>tion the number of difaffected perfons in the province,
</p>
<p>and the danger of keeping them in the city, thought
</p>
<p>fit to fend two hundred of them into Connecticut, to
</p>
<p>be kept in the different prifons till they could be
</p>
<p>brought conveniently to trial.
</p>
<p>It having appeared from ftrong evidence and many
</p>
<p>circum fiances, that David Matthews, Efq., Mayor of
</p>
<p>the City, was an aider and abetter of the confpiracy,
</p>
<p>and alfo the principal manager of an illegal correfpond-
</p>
<p>ence, he was feized by order of the provincial congrefs,
</p>
<p>and committed to the New Goal ; on the 3d of July,

<p>the committee again met, and ordered James Clayford
</p>
<p>to be brought before them.

<p>you to anfwer to thefe charges, or to fay why you

</p>
<p>Prifoner. I labour under every difadvantage, hav-

<p>ing no one to fpeak for me, and not being tried by

<p>a jury, but I have confidence in the humanity of

</p>
<p>Mr. Mulligen. You do not deferve fuch a favor,
</p>
<p>we are well fatisfied of your guilt, and that you ought

<p>long ago to have fufFered your deferts.
</p>
<p>Mr. Abeel. I think it will not take much time to

<p>re-examine the witneffes, not that I have any doubt of
</p>
<p>his guilt, but to give him no caufe of complaint at our
</p>
<p>proceedings.

<p>The committee agreed to it, and James Myer,

</p>
<p>brought papers and letters of the General's to the fo-

</p>
<p>Prifoner. Remember, Mr. Goff, you are upon oath,
</p>
<p>and that my life depends on it. As to my connection
</p>
<p>with Mrs. Gibbons I do not deny it, but never was
</p>
<p>concerned in any confpiracy. You rauft know, Mr.

<p>Goff, that I only faid at the fociety, that fuch a thing

<p>never agreed to or thought of doing it, nor did any

<p>Goff. Yes ; you often propofed it, and offered

</p>
<p>July 6. The congrefs received an account from
</p>
<p>Albany, that a body of Tories were detected in a de-
</p>
<p>fign of firing the town, and blowing up the magazines,
</p>
<p>and that fome of the principal perfons in the country
</p>
<p>were concerned in it. It appears that they have a
</p>
<p>correfpondence through the whole province and neigh-
</p>
<p>bouring colonies, and propofed to rife and make them-
</p>
<p>felves mafters of the fortrefTes, and difarm their ene-
</p>
<p>mies. Many of them were feized in Albany, but they
</p>
<p>would make no confeflion, and were thrown into goal.
</p>
<p>Scouts and parties were fent out in every county to
</p>
<p>watch and fecure the infurgents, about ninety have
</p>
<p>been taken in Albany and its neighborhood. It ap-
</p>
<p>peared that a body of fifty Tories rofe at Pough-
</p>
<p>keepfey, and attempted to difarm our friends, but
</p>
<p>after an obftinate engagement, in which five of them
</p>
<p>were killed, the reft were taken prifoners, and fent to
</p>
<p>Ridgefield. The congrefs taking thefe things into
</p>
<p>mature deliberation, refolved that fome examples
</p>
<p>mould be made, and accordingly ordered that James
</p>
<p>Clayford under condemnation, mould be fpeedily

<p>executed.

<p>July 7. The committee met, and ordered David

</p>
<p>You are charged, Sir, with being a principal adviferand
</p>
<p>abettor of fchemes againft your country ; we have
</p>
<p>evidence of your having attended an unlawful meet-
</p>
<p>ing, aflbciated for the purpofe of overturning the pre-
</p>
<p>fent constitution, and introducing the old tyranny. It
</p>
<p>appears that you have kept up a correfpondence with
</p>
<p>men adjudged enemies to this country, and have diftri-
</p>
<p>buted money in order to procure intelligence for
</p>
<p>them. If you have anything to fay, we are ready to
</p>
<p>hear it.
</p>
<p>Prifoner. This is a new mode of trial to hurry a
</p>
<p>man to prifon without letting him know his crime, to
</p>
<p>feize his papers and put armed men into his houfe,
</p>
<p>and then examine him in a private manner, without
</p>
<p>a jury of his peers, or giving him any information of
</p>
<p>his accufers, or allowing him to prepare for his de-
</p>
<p>fence. I fcorn your mercy, and am ready to fufFer
</p>
<p>for my King and country.  If I am to undergo the
</p>
<p>formality of a trial, let it be in the accuftomed manner,
</p>
<p>by a jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Mac Dougal. Sir, we are ready to do you all
</p>
<p>the juftice you can afk ; but we expect not to be bullied
</p>
<p>and cavaliered in this manner. We have told you

</p>
<p>yourfelves that the confpiracy you talk of is a mere
</p>
<p>pretence to punifh. The people you have thrown into
</p>
<p>prifon were guilty of no other mifdeeds than meeting
</p>
<p>in a focial manner, and exprefling their wifhes for the
</p>
<p>reftoration of the old conftitution ; they could not
</p>
<p>hurt you, when you are furrounded with fo formidable
</p>
<p>an army in your fervice : they never were mad enough
</p>
<p>to attempt fo wild a project. All they have done is
</p>
<p>to declare their opinions freely, during the opennefs
</p>
<p>of fociability and wine. I am fenfible of no other

<p>of fo mad and improbable a nature. You muft,

<p>therefore ufe your pleafure, for I cannot in my con-

<p>confine, or punifh any fubject of England.

</p>
<p>even here, for I would no where elfe, fuffer an act of

</p>
<p>do not deny, out of affection to the conftitution, but
</p>
<p>never had any notion fo abfurd as a confpiracy, to be
</p>
<p>managed and conducted at a tavern, in the hearing of

</p>
<p>buted was only out of benevolence, and in pity for

<p>^HK antipathy prevailing between the Southern and Eaftern

<p>troops, had been the caufe of a court-martial, of which
</p>
<p>I was a member, upon the condudl of Lieutenant Stewart
</p>
<p>of Smallwood's regiment, better known by his fubfequent title of Major
</p>
<p>Jack Stewart. He had been arretted by General Silliman, on account of
</p>
<p>fome alleged difrefpeel or difobedience to that officer. As the majority of
</p>
<p>the court were Southern men, it was not at all wonderful that Stewart was
</p>
<p>foon acquitted with honor. In fo contemptible a light were the New-
</p>
<p>England men regarded, that it was fcarcely held poffible to conceive a
</p>
<p>cafe, which could be conftrued into a reprehenfible difrefpedt. of them.
</p>
<p>Thinking fo highly as I now do of the gentlemen o^ this country, the
</p>
<p>recolleftion is painful, but the fact mult not be difTembled. Even the
</p>
<p>celebrated General Putnam, riding with a hanger belted acrofs his brawney
</p>
<p>moulders, over a waiftcoat without fleeves (his summer coftume), was
</p>
<p>deemed much fitter to head a band of ficklemen or ditchers, than mufket-
</p>
<p>eers. He might be brave, and had certainly an honeft manlinefs about
</p>
<p>him; but it was thought, and perhaps with reafon, that he was not what
</p>
<p>the time required. We had a regular army to oppofe and this could only
</p>
<p>be done by difcipline and regular foldicrfhip."  Graydon, 178-9, ed.

<p>" Time

<p>( 36 )
</p>
<p>" Time was, in defence of his King and the Right,
</p>
<p>We applauded brave Washington foremoft in fight :
</p>
<p>On the banks of Ohio he fhouted luftily
</p>
<p>God fave the King !
</p>
<p>Difappointed ambition his feet has milled ;
</p>
<p>Corrupted his heart and perverted his head :
</p>
<p>Loyal no longer, no more he cries faithfully
</p>
<p>Glory and joy crown the King! "
</p>
<p>" To caft a flur on the character of Wafhington would, to-day, be the
</p>
<p>aft, if of an American, of a very filly or a very difhoneft man. The
</p>
<p>latitude of party heats and perfonal rivalries permitted a lefs reftrained
</p>
<p>conduct during his life-time. The Tories had furely fome excufe for
</p>
<p>fpeaking bitterly of the only man by whom the American armies could
</p>
<p>have been l-d to victory and independence ; for the vanquifhed party has
</p>
<p>in all times poiIeHed at leaft the privilege of murmuring againft its con-
</p>
<p>queror. But it mult not be forgotten that long before and long after the
</p>
<p>war, as well as through its continuance, Wafhington was the object of
</p>
<p>/the envy and calumny of others than the adherents of the Englifh crown.
</p>
<p>The earlieft public outrage offered to his character, appears in the official
</p>
<p>Mhnoire, fcnt in 1756, by Louis XV. to the other fovereigns of Europe,
</p>
<p>in which, referring to Wafhington's Ohio expedition and the death of
</p>
<p>Jumonville, in 1754, he says: " II parlit que Pimpofture ne coiite rien a
</p>
<p>M. Wajbington ; ici il i'en fait honneur." It is amufing to find that
</p>
<p>Beaumarchais in 1779, replying to Gibbon's ftatement and jufiifying the
</p>
<p>aid given by France to America, heads his Hit of outrages exercifed by
</p>
<p>'England with this charge of afTaffination ! He did not know that the
</p>
<p>falfehood hit the chief of the Americans, inftead of the Englifh court.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the original afTertion by a foe of this bold flander " may be for-
</p>
<p>given, though it cannot be applauded : " but its repetition was unfortu-
</p>
<p>nate on the lips of a friend. But the friends of America in the war were
</p>
<p>not all friends of Wafhington. His appearance in uniform in the con-
</p>
<p>grefs of 1775, and the military experience he had acquired, undoubtedly
</p>
<p>familiarized the minds of fome members with the idea of his nomination
</p>
<p>to be commander of the army : but the confent of many of the delegates

<p>to this appointment was only extorted by the neceffities of the cafe, and
</p>
<p>was a fource "of real regret in nearly one-half" of the gentlemen who
</p>
<p>made
</p>
<p>( 37 )
</p>
<p>made it. A number of the members were for Mr. Hancock; more were
</p>
<p>for Charles Lee ; many for Wafhington ; but the greateft number were
</p>
<p>for Artemas Ward. There is room, however, for the inference that
</p>
<p>there was no defire on the part of a majority to maintain at the conti-
</p>
<p>nental expenfe a New-England army, with New England officers, to fight
</p>
<p>New England battles on New-England foil. There was a fouthern party
</p>
<p>againft a northern ; " and fo many of our ftauncheft men," says Adams,
</p>
<p>" were in the plan, that we could carry nothing without conceding to it.
</p>
<p>Another embarraffment, which was never publicly known, and which
</p>
<p>was carefully concealed by thofe who knew it, the MafTachufetts and
</p>
<p>other New-England delegates were divided. Mr. Hancock and Mr.
</p>
<p>Cufhing hung back ; Mr. Paine did not come forward, and even Mr.
</p>
<p>Samuel Adams was irrefolute. Mr. Hancock, himfelf, had an ambition
</p>
<p>to be appointed commander-in-chief. * * * * When I came to
</p>
<p>defcribe Wafhington for the commander, I never marked a more finking
</p>
<p>and fudden change of countenance. Mortification and refentment were
</p>
<p>expreffed as forcibly as his (Hancock's) face could exhibit them." Mr.
</p>
<p>C. F. Adams adds, that neither Hancock nor Ward was ever afterwards
</p>
<p>cordial towards Wafhington. Nor were the Virginia delegates unanimous
</p>
<p>in his favor: "particularly Mr. Pendleton was very clear and full
</p>
<p>againft it." When the queftion was debated, there was a warm oppofi-
</p>
<p>tion to Wafhington ; on public, however, and not on any pcrfonal grounds.
</p>
<p>Pendleton, Sherman, Cufhing, and feveral others joined in it, fearing
</p>
<p>" difcontents in the army and in New-England." This army, it mult be
</p>
<p>recollected, confided at that time almoft entirely of the men raifed by
</p>
<p>and in New England, and gathered before Bofton. * * * * *
</p>
<p>" Long after the peace, John Jay faid that in the congrefs of the
</p>
<p>Revolution there was always, from firft to laft, a molt bitter party againft
</p>
<p>Wafhington. What were the various motives of its members, it is im-
</p>
<p>poffible to fay, fince their names even cannot, with fullnefs and accuracy,
</p>
<p>be now afecrtained. It is but fair, however, to give the benefit of a
</p>
<p>doubt, and to fuppofe that it was an apprehenfion of the effect which fo
</p>
<p>much power and popularity might have on his ambition. The future was
</p>
<p>as yet unfeen ; and many men knew not what would be the confequences

<p>of the attainment of independence. "The fubjugation of my country,"
</p>
<p>faid Edward Biddle, whofe declining health had compelled him to forego
</p>
<p>the
</p>
<p>( 38 )
</p>
<p>the influence his talents would have given him as delegate in congrefs
</p>
<p>from Pennfylvania, "I deprecate as a moft grievous calamity; and yet
</p>
<p>ficken at the idea of thirteen, unconnected, petty democracies ; if we
</p>
<p>are to be independent, let us, in the name of God, at once have an em-
</p>
<p>pire, and place Wajbington at the head of it." But this idea was not
</p>
<p>pleafing to our people, whofe experience of the benefit of monarchy was
</p>
<p>not great, and very few of whom had ever been diftinguifhed by any
</p>
<p>royal favor ; or, as an Englifh verfifier fang :
</p>
<p>Poor loft America, high honours miffing,
</p>
<p>Knows nought of fmile and nod, and fweet hand-kiffing :
</p>
<p>Knows nought of golden promifes of kings ;
</p>
<p>In folitude the lovely rebel fighs !
</p>
<p>But vainly drops the penitential tear 
</p>
<p>Deaf as the adder to the woman's cries,
</p>
<p>We fufFer not her wail to wound our ear :
</p>
<p>For food, we bid her hopelefs children prowl,
</p>
<p>And with the favage of the defert howl.
</p>
<p>But fuch " fears of the brave and follies of the wife " are incident to
</p>
<p>human nature; and the jealoufy of Wafliington may have in fome cafes
</p>
<p>been connected with honeft though blind judgments. It was a public
</p>
<p>bleffing, thought Adams, that the glorious defence of the Delaware forts,
</p>
<p>in 1777, was "not immediately due to the commander-in-chief, nor to
</p>
<p>fouthern troops. If it had been, idolatry and adulation would have been
</p>
<p>unbounded; fo exceflive as to endanger our liberties, for what I know.
</p>
<p>Now, we can allow a certain citizen to be wife, virtuous and good with-
</p>
<p>out thinking him a deity or a faviour." It was in the fame year that the
</p>
<p>writer took fire in congrefs at the fentiments entertained for the general
</p>
<p>by certain members : "lam diftreffed to find fome of our members
</p>
<p>difpofed to idolize an image which their own hands have molten. I
</p>
<p>fpeak of the fuperftitious veneration which is paid to General Wafhington.
</p>
<p>I honour him for his good qualities, but in this houfe, I feel myfelf his
</p>
<p>fuperior. In private life, I lhall always acknowledge him to be mine."
</p>
<p>The cabal againft Wafhington was never more violent than at this time,
</p>
<p>and probably debate ran high and warm language was ufed on either

<p>fide : and his enemies, if we may rely on the following anecdote, were
</p>
<p>more powerful in the council chamber than in the camp. In a Life of
</p>
<p>Lord
</p>
<p>( 39 )
</p>
<p>Lord Stirling, the father-in-law of William Duer, written by Mr Duer's
</p>
<p>fon (and the relationfhip is of fome importance to the authenticity of the
</p>
<p>anecdote), occurs this fingular paflage : "It is related by Mr. Dunlap
</p>
<p>in his hiftory of New York, upon the authority, it is prefumed, of the
</p>
<p>late General Morgan Lewis, that a day had been appointed by the Cabal
</p>
<p>in Congrefs for one of them to move for a Committee to proceed to the
</p>
<p>camp at Valley Forge, to arreft General Wafhington ; and that the
</p>
<p>motion would have fucceeded had they not unexpectedly loft the majority
</p>
<p>which they pofTefTed when the meafure was determined on. At that
</p>
<p>time, there were but two delegates in attendance from New-York, Francis
</p>
<p>Lewis, the father of the late General Morgan Lewis, and William Duer,
</p>
<p>the fon-in-law of Lord Stirling  barely sufficient to entitle the state to a
</p>
<p>vote, if both were prefent. But Mr. Duer was confined to his bed by a
</p>
<p>fevere and dangerous illnefs. His colleague, Mr. Lewis, had fent an ex-
</p>
<p>prefs for Mr. Gouverneur Morris, one of the abfent members, who
</p>
<p>however, had not arrived on the morning of the day on which the mo-
</p>
<p>tion was to have been made. Finding this to be the cafe, Mr. D. inquired
</p>
<p>of his phyfician. Dr. John Jones, whether it was pofhble for him to be
</p>
<p>carried to the Court-Houfe where Congrefs fat. The dodlor told him it
</p>
<p>was poffible, but it would be at the rifle of his life. ' Do you mean,'
</p>
<p>faid Mr. D., ' that I fhould expire before reaching the place ? ' ' No,'
</p>
<p>replied the dodlor, ' but I would not anfwer for your leaving it alive.'
</p>
<p>'Very well, fir/ faid Mr. D., 'you have done your duty, and I will do
</p>
<p>mine. Prepare a litter for me ; if you will not, fomebody elfe will 
</p>
<p>but I prefer your aid.' The litter was prepared, and the fick man
</p>
<p>placed in it, when the arrival of Mr. Morris rendered the further ufe of
</p>
<p>it unnecefTary, and baffled the intrigue that had induced its preparation."
</p>
<p>The date of this anecdote was fuch as to render it extremely improbable
</p>
<p>that the American army, if it fubmitted to Washington's depofal, would
</p>
<p>have ftruck another blow under another leader for Congrefs. " I remem-
</p>
<p>ber well, fays a public writer in 1780, " that fuch was the fituation of
</p>
<p>the army, while they lay at Valley Forge in the winter of the year 1778,
</p>
<p>deftitute of cloathing, many times in want of provifions, and greatly dif-
</p>

</p>
<p>H declared
</p>
<p>( +o )
</p>
<p>declared to me, that * fuch had been the ftate of things, that nothing but
</p>
<p>the great virtues of that man had kept the army together.' "
</p>
<p>" Much concerning this Cabal, and its workings in the Congrefs of 1 778,
</p>
<p>exifts in Gordon : whence it would feem that delegates from MafTachufetts
</p>
<p>and Virginia were deep in the affair. Samuel Adams, he fays, was con-
</p>
<p>cerned in it, and adds : " The army was fo confident of it, and fo
</p>
<p>enraged, that perfons were ftationed to watch him, as he approached the
</p>
<p>camp, on his return home. But he is commonly pofTefTed of good : ntel-
</p>
<p>ligence, and was careful to keep at a fafe diftance. Had he fallen into
</p>
<p>the hands of the officers, when in that paroxifm of refentment, they
</p>
<p>would probably have handled him fo as to have endangered his life, and
</p>
<p>tarnifhed their own honour."
</p>
<p>There is a curious article in the Pennfylvania Evening Poft, July 24th,
</p>
<p>1779, which may refer to this anti-Wafhington Party in Congrefs: "a
</p>
<p>junto who have endeavored to fubjedl all things to themfelves, all power,
</p>
<p>civil, military and marine : Who have endeavored to remove every
</p>
<p>perfon that would not mingle in their factious views ; and to place none
</p>
<p>in office but their friends, relatives and dependents ; againft whofe male-
</p>
<p>volence the unfullied fame of the great American patriot was but a flender
</p>
<p>barrier; whofe viftim was a W*********  and whofe idol
</p>
<p>was a L * *." The fame journal (July gth, 1779) mentions the exig-
</p>
<p>ence in Congrefs of a fort of Club of certain New-England, New-Jerfey,
</p>
<p>and Pennfylvania delegates, with two or three from the Southward ; the
</p>
<p>foundation of which had been laid in the firft Congrefs, when there was
</p>
<p>caufe to fear that New-York and one or two other middle colonies were
</p>
<p>averfe to extreme meafures. Among the Wafhington party in Congrefs, I
</p>
<p>mould put fuch names as thofe of Robert Lewis, and Gouverneur Mor-
</p>
<p>ris ; Jay ; Paca ; Burke ; Drayton ; Duane ; Duer ; Francis Lewis. The
</p>
<p>queftion is not fo clear in regard to Samuel Adams ; Mifflin ; Witherfpoon ;
</p>
<p>Rufh ; Jefferfon ; the Lees, &c. ; though any conc'ufion to be arrived at
</p>
<p>mull in fome meafure be conjectural. In 1789, Samuel Adams in a
</p>
<p>manner denied to a friend the truth of Dr. Gordon's Statement of his
</p>
<p>having been concerned in a plot to remove Wafhington. And in 1796,

<p>community of action between Samuel Adams and Thomas McKean :
</p>
<p>" The feelings of friendfhip excite a curiofity to know how McKean will
</p>
<p>vote. By that I fhall guefs how Governor Adams would have voted ! "
</p>
<p>On April 4th, 1778, Patrick Henry wrote to Richard Henry Lee that he
</p>
<p>(Lee) was traduced in Virginia by perfons who alleged that he was en-
</p>
<p>gaged in a fcheme to difcard Wafhington : and in 1780, Dr. William
</p>
<p>Shippen, jun., wrote thus to him of General Greene: "He is a little
</p>
<p>fufpicious that you are not perfectly fatisfied with his conduct, becaufe you
</p>
<p>were faid to be inimical to our commander, and, of confequence, to him,
</p>
<p>who was fuppofed to be one of his flatterers  this falfe idea I have re-
</p>
<p>probated to General Greene, and allured him he would find you his
</p>
<p>friend and ufeful confidant." And it is faid, alio, that the occafion of
</p>
<p>Lee's lofing his popularity at home, and his feat in Congrefs in 1777, was
</p>
<p>chiefly becaufe he had compelled his tenants to pay their rents. His
</p>
<p>biographer and namefake, in feveral places, flouts the charge made by
</p>
<p>Judge Johnfon, in the Life of Greene, that Richard Henry Lee was
</p>
<p>Washington's enemy. But if Samuel Adams was, fo was, probably, Lee.
</p>
<p>It is at all events a gratifying thing to remark that no one, in later days,
</p>
<p>had the moral courage to confefs that he was concerned in the bufinefs ;
</p>
<p>indeed its very name of Conway's Cabal Ihows that its members were
</p>
<p>afraid or afhamed to avow their complicity ; for Conway was but a tool
</p>
<p>of the hour, whom it was eafy enough for a fellow-foldier to filence, and
</p>
<p>whofe name was affixed to a fcheme (that he doubtlefs approved of, but
</p>
<p>which was concocted by longer heads than his own) merely to avert the
</p>
<p>attention of the world from its real authors. In the army, indeed, the
</p>
<p>love and veneration for Wafhington was boundlefs, and almoff. univerfal ;
</p>
<p>and, here, truly, lay the (tumbling-block of his enemies. It was only in
</p>
<p>the immediate circle of fome of the foreign-born officers, as Conway, Lee,
</p>
<p>and Gates, that an oppofite opinion was heard. Lee's fentiments in re-
</p>
<p>gard to " Wafhington and his puppies " are fufficiently well known.
</p>
<p>" Entre nous, 1 ' he says to Gates in December, 1776, " a certain great
</p>
<p>man is damnably deficient." "As to his talents for the command of an
</p>
<p>army," faid Gates to Graydon, ' with a French fhrug,' " they were
</p>
<p>miferable indeed." The teftimony of the civilian, who was forced to

</p>
<p>another,
</p>
<p>(42 )
</p>
<p>another, becaufe Wafhington, with valtly inferior forces could not drive
</p>
<p>Howe out of Philadelphia, would be amufing but for the circumftance
</p>
<p>that, himfelf in a pofition to obtain a comfortable dinner  " a good
</p>
<p>*oaft turkey, plain pudding, and minced pies,"  he could fo grievoufly
</p>
<p>have mifconceived the condition of the Army in his vicinity. As Mr.
</p>
<p>William B. Reed juflly obferves : " The fufferings of the Americans
</p>
<p>during their winter cantonment at the Valley Forge have been often de-
</p>
<p>feribed. They have never been exaggerated." Yet, in the end of De-
</p>
<p>cember, 1777, after noticing Howe's movements, a Pennfylvania Whig
</p>
<p>remarks : " All this is done in the view of our Generals and our Army,
</p>
<p>who are carelefs of us, but carefully confulting where they (hall go to
</p>
<p>fpend the winter in jollity, gaming, and caroufing. O tell not this in
</p>
<p>.France or Spain ! Publifh it not in the ftreets of London, Liverpool or
</p>
<p>Briltol, left the uncircumcifed there fhould rejoice, and fhouting for joy,
</p>
<p>fay : " America is ours, for the rebels are difmayed and afraid to fight
</p>
<p>us any longer! O Americans, where is now your virtue? O Wafhing-
</p>
<p>ton, where is your courage?" In this note, no citation is made of
</p>
<p>Tory or Britifh accufations againft Wafhington. One of thefe was,
</p>
<p>however, againft his chaftity ; and fome of the charges went fo far
</p>
<p>as to identify the woman and to trace the offspring. This is only
</p>
<p>recurred to here, becaufe of a like infinuation being made apparently
</p>
<p>by Charles Lee, to General Reed, in 1778 ; but with great propriety the
</p>
<p>latter repelled as unworthy of credence the flanders that charged the
</p>
<p>commander-in-chief with "great cruelty to his flaves in Virginia, and
</p>
<p>immorality of life, though they acknowledge it is fo very fecret that it is
</p>
<p>difficult to detect it."
</p>
<p>In the clofe of 1779, General Sullivan warned Wafhington that the
</p>
<p>Cabal of 1777 againft him ftill exiflcd, and waited only for fufficient
</p>
<p>ltrength to attack him openly. He therefore advifes him to keep on his
</p>
<p>guard. " Appearances may deceive even an Angel. Could you have
</p>
<p>believed, four years ago, that thofe adulators, thofe perfons fo tenderly
</p>
<p>and fo friendly ufed, as were Gates, Mifflin, Reed and Tudor, would
</p>
<p>become your fecret and bitter, though unprovoked enemies. If we view
</p>
<p>them now, we cannot help lamenting the want of lincerity in mankind."

<p>opponents and fellow-citizens in 1795, 1796, and 1797. Compared
</p>
<p>with the language of Valerius, Pittachus, A Calm objerver, Sec, former
</p>
<p>fcurrility alrnofl became praifc. Every variety of evil, from avarice and
</p>
<p>fraud to tyranny and murder, was imputed to his hands, with a power of
</p>
<p>conception and expreffion that leaves us no room to wonder thaL
</p>
<p>he fhould have difdaincd to run the gauntlet of a third presidential
</p>
<p>term; that "he prudently retreated," to quote the remark of his
</p>
<p>fucceflor. " Will not the world be led to conclude," fays one, " that
</p>
<p>the mafk of political hypocrify has been alike worn by a Carfar, a Crom-
</p>
<p>well, and a Wafhington ! " " Had the meridian blaze of the prcfident's
</p>
<p>popularity continued much longer," writes another, " the lamp of Ameri-
</p>
<p>can liberty would have been extinguished forever. Happily for humanity,
</p>
<p>a change has taken place before it was too late, and the confecrated
</p>
<p>ermine of prcfidcntial chaftity fecms too foul for time itfelf to bleach."
</p>
<p>In the Philadelphia Aurora, a paper edited with dctcftablc ability, will
</p>
<p>be found fcorcs of pieces of a like nature. What can be more lamentable
</p>
<p>than fuch lines as thefc, publifhcd at the very epoch ('March 4th, 1797)
</p>
<p>of Washington's withdrawal to private lifer '"Lord, Icttcfr. now thy
</p>
<p>fcrvant depart in peace, for mine eyes have feen thy falvation," ' was the
</p>
<p>pious ejaculation of a man who beheld a flood of happinefs rufhing in
</p>
<p>upon mankind. If ever there was a time that would licenfe the reiteration
</p>
<p>of the exclamation, that time is now arrived : for the man who is the
</p>
<p>fource of all the misfortu/ics of our country, is this day reduced to a
</p>
<p>level with his fellow-citizens, and is no longer pofTefled of a power to
</p>
<p>multiply evil upon the United States. If ever there was a period for
</p>
<p>rejoicing, this is the moment. Every heart in unifon with the freedom
</p>
<p>and happinefs of the people, ought to beat high with exultation that the
</p>
<p>name of Wafhington from this day ecafes to give a currency to political
</p>
<p>iniquity, and to legalize corruption  a new aera is now opening upon us,
</p>
<p>an acra which promifes much to the people ; for public meafurcs muft
</p>
<p>now fland upon their own merits, and nefarious projects can no I
</p>
<p>be fupportcd by a name. When a retrofpect is taken of the Wafljing-

<p>publicanifm in an enlightened people, jufl emerged from the gulf of
</p>
<p>defpotifm, and fhould have carried his defigns againfl public liberty fo
</p>
<p>far,
</p>
<p>(4+ )
</p>
<p>far, as to have put in jeopardy its very exiitence ; fuch, however, are the
</p>
<p>fafts, and with thefe flaring us in the face, this day ought to be a jubilee
</p>
<p>in the United States." In 1813, John Adams, writing to Jefferfon, re-
</p>
<p>fers to "the terrorifm excited by Genet, in 1793, when 10,000 people
</p>
<p>in the ftreets of Philadelphia, day after day, threatened to drag Wafhing-
</p>
<p>ton out of his houfe, and effecT: a revolution in the government, or com-
</p>
<p>pel it to declare war in favor of the French revolution and againfl Eng-
</p>
<p>land. The cooleft and the firmeil minds, even among the Quakers in
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, have given their opinions to me, that nothing but the yellow
</p>
<p>fever, which removed Dr. Hutchinfon and Jonathan Dickinfon Sergeant
</p>
<p>from this world, could have faved the United States from a fatal revolu-
</p>
<p>tion of government." But Adams's morbid jealoufy of every one whofe
</p>
<p>fame outfhone or even (in his own opinion) rivalled his own, cankers
</p>
<p>very many of his judgments on Wafhington. While Prefident himfelf, he
</p>
<p>complained that he was annoyed by " puppets, danced upon the wires
</p>
<p>of two jugglers behind the fcenes ; and thefe jugglers were Hamilton and
</p>
<p>Wafhington." In another and (as believed) unpublifhed manufcript,
</p>
<p>he fays (Aug. 23rd, 1806): "The Federalifts, as thev are called by
</p>
<p>themfelves and their enemies, have done themfelves and their country in-
</p>
<p>calculable injury by making Wafhington their political, religious, and even
</p>
<p>moral pope, and afcribing everything to him. Hancock, Samuel Adams,
</p>
<p>, and feveral others have been much more efTential characters
</p>
<p>to America than Wafhington. Another character, almoft forgotten, of
</p>
<p>more importance than any of them all, was James Otis. It is to offend
</p>
<p>againfl eternal juftice to give to one, as this people do, the merits of fo
</p>
<p>many. It is an effectual extinguifher of all patriotifm and all public virtue,
</p>
<p>and throws the nation entirely into the h^.nds of intrigue. You lament
</p>
<p>the growth of Corruption very juftly ; but there is none more poifonous
</p>
<p>than the eternal puffing and trumpeting of Wafhington and Franklin, and
</p>
<p>the inceffant abufe of the real Fathers of the country.
</p>
<p>Defpite all that has been faid, too, of Mr. Jefferibn's relations with
</p>
<p>Wafhington, it is difficult to hold that thefe really could have been of a
</p>
<p>perfectly fincere and friendly nature. It was believed in Washington's
</p>
<p>family that, fhortly before his death, he opened his mind very plainly to

</p>
<p>Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman in New York to his
</p>
<p>Friend in Hartford, dated June 27, 1776.
</p>
<p>YOU have no doubt heard of a moft horrid confpiracy lately
</p>
<p>difcovered in this place. I have had no opportunity to examine
</p>
<p>the evidences in fupport of the fact ; but from the weight of the
</p>
<p>perfons who have appeared to profecute the inquiry, and the circumftan-
</p>
<p>ces that have been mentioned, I have no doubt of the truth of the general
</p>
<p>charge. The fubftance of it, I take to be this, that Governour Tryon in
</p>
<p>this, and other fimilar emiflaries in all the other Governments, have been
</p>
<p>for a long time ufing all the influence that the command of the Miniftry
</p>
<p>and Treafury in England could give them, to bribe and cajole our princi-
</p>
<p>pal people in all the Colonies to act. in concert with their plans ; that by
</p>
<p>degrees they have brought numbers fully to co-operate with them ; and,
</p>
<p>after being led on too far to recede, flick at nothing, however villanous and
</p>
<p>horrible, to accomplifh their defigns ; that the principal emiflaries have, by
</p>
<p>purfuing the fame methods that were fuccefsfully practiced upon them-
</p>
<p>felves, drawn in thofe beneath them, fo as to take in all degrees, from the
</p>
<p>prince to the fcavenger ; that a diftribution of money and arms has been
</p>
<p>fecretly made from the greater to the leaft branches ; that there were
</p>
<p>fchemes to diftinguifh who were in the plot, without fpeaking; that when
</p>
<p>all was ready for execution, the moft vigorous efforts were to be made in
</p>
<p>different parts at once to land the troops and pufh their operations ; at
</p>
<p>the fame time all our moft important pofts were to be fei2ed by the con-
</p>
<p>fpirators on fhore; among ourfelves all our important men were to be

<p>feized or murdered, together with all that were friendly attached to the

</p>
<p>views or give them trouble. General Wafhington was among the firft
</p>
<p>that were to be facrificed, and the reft in fucceflion, according to their
</p>
<p>importance. A number of the General's Guard have already been

<p>taken up, were bribed to murder him, and have for fome time received

<p>Examinant carried the faid Benjamin to Paulus Hook Ferry, who was
</p>
<p>J there
</p>
<p>( 56 )
</p>
<p>there refcued by Sergeant Cornet, of Captain Roofeve/t's company, and
</p>
<p>by the faid captain enlifted. Examinant then met James Mafon, one of
</p>
<p>the workmen of Mr. Erjkine, who had fome time ago been difcharged.
</p>
<p>James Mafon afked examinant if he did not want to fee James Ram/ay,
</p>
<p>Chriftopher Wiley, and George Gammell. Examinant faid yes. James
</p>
<p>Mafon faid examinant might fee them if he would take an oath that he
</p>
<p>did not come to take them up; which examinant refufed, faying he would,
</p>
<p>neverthelefs, be glad to fee them. Mafon afked examinant if he had run
</p>
<p>away; who anfwered in the affirmative. Mafon then afked what examin-
</p>
<p>ant would do with himfelf, and whether he would do as he and the reft
</p>
<p>of them had done. Examinant afked what that was. Mafon faid he
</p>
<p>muft go and be qualified, and then he would tell him. Examinant
</p>
<p>agreed to be qualified ; but afked on what foundation ? Mafon told him
</p>
<p>he was to fwear before a gentleman in this town to go on board of the
</p>
<p>man-of-war ; that he {Mafon) and his companions had fc fworn, and
</p>
<p>were to receive wages and provifions until they fhould be able to get
</p>
<p>there. Examinant afked who the gentleman was that fwore them.
</p>
<p>Mafon replied it was a gentleman employed by the Mayor or Governour
</p>
<p>of the town ; but the examinant thinks it was the Mayor who fwore
</p>
<p>them and found provifions for them until they had an opportunity to get
</p>
<p>on board the man-of-war. Mafon then conducted examinant to the
</p>
<p>houfe where George Gammel, James Ramfay, and Cbriflopher Wyley
</p>
<p>lived. This houfe is a Scotchman's, juft below the Jews' Synagogue, a
</p>
<p>private houfe ; does not know the man's name. When examinant came
</p>
<p>in, George Gammel afked him if he was in purfuit of them ; who anfwered
</p>
<p>in the negative. George Gamme/ then faid, Did you come away in the
</p>
<p>fame manner as we did ? Examinant faid yes. Gammel then faid, we
</p>
<p>will have a drink together. Gammel faid he would divulge his mind to
</p>
<p>examinant if examinant would be true to him. Examinant anfwered, " I
</p>
<p>will be as true to you as you are to me." Gammel then took examinant
</p>
<p>afide, and afked when he would go on board of the man-of-war. Ex-
</p>
<p>aminant faid he did not know, but would take the firft good opportunity.
</p>
<p>Afked examinant if he wanted a pafs. Examinant faid he had a pafs
</p>
<p>fufficient for him to go as far as he wanted. Gammel brought to examin-

<p>ant a perfon to give him a pafs, whom examinant does not know, but
</p>
<p>believes he mould know him again if he were to fee him. Examinant
</p>
<p>faid
</p>
<p>( 57 )
</p>
<p>faid he wanted to fee the New England encampment, to fee one Amos
</p>
<p>Hutchins, a Captain; intending to decoy them thither, and have them
</p>
<p>apprehended. When examinant had got about half way up the Broad-
</p>
<p>way, they difcovered his piftols, and would have fled, thinking, as examin-
</p>
<p>ant fuppofes, that he meant to take them up. James Ram/ay and Cbrijlo-
</p>
<p>pher Wyley ran off. Examinant purfued and caught James Ram/ay.
</p>
<p>They then gathered together, and afked examinant why he carried
</p>
<p>piftols ; who replied that they were for his defenfe, until with them he
</p>
<p>could get on board of the man-of-war. They being then fufpicious,
</p>
<p>turned back ; but examinant firft afked George Gammel when he intended
</p>
<p>to go on board of the man-of-war, and how. Gammel anfwered 'I intend
</p>
<p>to leave town this night, and go to Long IJland, and get from thence to
</p>
<p>the man-of-war ; ' but whether to get a perfon to put him on board, or
</p>
<p>to fteal a boat or canoe, this examinant is not certain. Gammel then
</p>
<p>faid the gentleman who was employed by the Mayor had defired them
</p>
<p>not to be feen more than two together. The gentleman had further told
</p>
<p>him the Riflemen were fo thick on Long-IJland as to prevent him from
</p>
<p>getting on board until a more convenient opportunity ; and perhaps they
</p>
<p>might not get on board until General Howe arrived with his fleet. They
</p>
<p>expefled a large body of men to join them from Gojben, and they were
</p>
<p>to get on board with the utmoft defpatch after General Howe's arrival.

</p>
<p>James Ma/on fays : About two weeks and a half ago a man took his
</p>
<p>qualification that he would not divulge anything about the bufinefs he was
</p>
<p>then upon. When he went up to Gojhen from Kingjwood, about five
</p>
<p>weeks ago, to look for a place as a miller, he faw a man who had been
</p>
<p>four days en board the man-of-war, by name William Forbes, a tanner
</p>
<p>and currier by trade ; that as you go up the Broadway you come to the
</p>

<p>keeper, a fat man, who wears a blue coat, and that he hath frequently
</p>
<p>( 58 )
</p>
<p>met the laid William Forbes in that houfe ; that he told examinant he
</p>
<p>never lodged twice in the fame houfe, being afraid ; examinant afked
</p>
<p>where he did lodge, Forbes would not tell him ; that Forbes hath a houfe
</p>
<p>of his own, five miles from Gojken, at which he faw him when examinant
</p>
<p>was looking for a place. Forbes told examinant he had been four days
</p>
<p>on board the man-of-war laft Jpril, when the (hip Savage fired on Staten-
</p>
<p>IJland; that Governour Try on would give five guineas bounty and two
</p>
<p>hundred acres of land for each man, one hundred for his wife, and fifty for
</p>
<p>each child, upon condition they would cnlift. in his Majefty's fervice.
</p>
<p>Examinant bore Forbes's expenfes to town, Forbes undertaking to repay
</p>
<p>him in hard cafh when they got on board ; that Forbes was to have a
</p>
<p>bounty from the Governour for every man he could get, and had been
</p>
<p>fent home for that purpofe; that the Governour had defircd him to go up
</p>
<p>and get as many men as he could ; that the recruits were to afiift the
</p>
<p>King's troops when they came; that recruits were not to go on board,
</p>
<p>becaufe they could do more good on fhore, and befides they were on
</p>
<p>fhort allowance in the fhip and crowded, as Forbes told examinant.
</p>
<p>Forbes and examinant came to New-Tork by way of Elizabethtown, and
</p>
<p>in their way, at Warwick, Forbes enticed William Benjamin to go along
</p>
<p>with him, and at Elixabethtown Forbes inquired at Deacon Ogden's,
</p>
<p>where he ufed to work, and told examinant, after the inquiry, that they
</p>
<p>could not get on board from Bergen-Point or Staten-LJland, as there were
</p>
<p>Riflemen ftationed there, but muft go to Nczv-Tork, for that there was a
</p>
<p>man there, one McLean, a fhoemaker, near the Royal Exchange, who was
</p>
<p>employed by the Governour to carry recruits on board ; that Forbes and
</p>
<p>examinant came to New-Tork in an Elixabethtown boat, and went firft
</p>
<p>to Thomas Majon's at the corner of Beaver ftreet and Broadway, at the
</p>
<p>fign of the Highlander, where they left their baggage, and William Ben-
</p>
<p>jamin to take care of it, and went thence to McLean's, to inquire for a
</p>
<p>paffagc ; that McLean and Forbes whifpered together, and then Forbes
</p>
<p>told examinant that McLean faid there was no opportunity of getting on
</p>
<p>board in two or three nights ; that McLean recommended them to one
</p>
<p>James lloulding, a tavern-keeper in Tryon Row oppofite the gate of the

<p>Benjamin Hill at Majon's, and, after dufk, examinant went for Benjamin,
</p>
<p>and he and Benjamin carried the baggage up, and all three lodged at
</p>
<p>Houlding's
</p>
<p>( 59 )
</p>
<p>Moulding s that night, telling Moulding Mr. McLean had fent and recom-
</p>
<p>mended them there as a fafe houfe ; next morning Forbes went to fee for
</p>
<p>an opportunity to get on board, and did the like for two or three days;
</p>
<p>Forbes and Benjamin ftaid at Mouldings one week without being able to
</p>
<p>get on board of the man-of-war ; William Benjamin agreed to go on
</p>
<p>board the man-of-war alfo, and accept the Governour's bounty ; after the
</p>
<p>firft week, as they could not get on board, Moulding obferved that they
</p>
<p>ought to be fpread about, for that keeping them together would occafion
</p>
<p>fufpicion in his houfe ; that one Corbie, who lives near General Wash-
</p>
<p>ington's, ufed to refort to the houfe of Moulding, where he was introduced
</p>
<p>to Forbes, and this examinant alfo got acquainted with Corbie; that many
</p>
<p>Tories reforted to Houldings, amongft whom were two brothers, of the
</p>
<p>name of Fortune, the one a tanner, living in the Swamp, and the other
</p>
<p>a faddler, whom he hath feen working at Cook's, in the Broadzvay; alfo,
</p>
<p>one Fleeter a filverfmith, who was ridden about town for a Tory, and
</p>
<p>another of the fame name, whom he takes to be his brother; alfo, a man
</p>
<p>without an arm, whom he believes to be an old penfioner, and Gilbert
</p>
<p>Fofier, a gunfmith, living oppofite to Mr. Mull's tavern, a fhort, thick
</p>
<p>man who wears a white coat ; that thefe perfons, as he believes, knew of
</p>
<p>the examinant's intention, but did not care to truft him, as he had not
</p>
<p>taken his qualification ; that examinant was qualified before the faid Gil-
</p>
<p>bert Forbes, and the faid William Forbes, at the houfe of the faid Corbie 
</p>
<p>that William Forbes gave him the book, and that they made him fwear
</p>
<p>not to divulge anything of what the examinant now tells; that when
</p>
<p>examinant was at Mouldings, Gilbert Forbes, William Forbes, and Corbie,
</p>
<p>advifed examinant to go to Corbie's houfe and work a little in the garden
</p>
<p>to prevent fufpicion. Gilbert Forbes promifed examinant ten (hillings
</p>
<p>per week fubfiftence money, of which this examinant hath, at different
</p>
<p>times, received twenty fix millings and eight pence ; that the examinant
</p>
<p>complained ten (hillings was too little; Forbes said he could not help it
</p>
<p>but he would write to the Governour to try to get it increafed to twelve 
</p>
<p>that he afterwards told examinant he could not get an anfwer, becaufe a
</p>
<p>boat coming from the Governour was near being taken, and had thrown
</p>
<p>the letters overboard ; that William Benjamin and William Forbes have

<p>laft
</p>
<p>( 6o )
</p>
<p>laft Saturday; that while examinant lived at Houldings, Corbie came
</p>
<p>there between nine and ten o'clock at night, and brought with him a
</p>
<p>mulatto-colored negro, drefled in blue clothes, about five feet eight inches
</p>
<p>high, well-set, but knows not his name or to whom he belongs, but is
</p>
<p>informed that he hath fince been taken up and put in jail ; when Corbie
</p>
<p>and the negro came in there was a great deal of whifpering round between
</p>
<p>Corbie William Forbes, the negro, and another man who had been wait-
</p>
<p>ing to get on board and did go on board that evening; that afterwards
</p>
<p>the examinant and William Forbes had fome converfation about the negro ;

<p>Forbes told him the negro was going on board the man-of-war with that
</p>

<p>ry them all for fear of difcovery, wherefore he, Benjamin, and William

<p>Forbes, were obliged to flay behind ; that when this examinant was quali-
</p>
<p>fied there was prefent one Clarke, who had been a schoolmafter about

<p>eight or nine miles from Go/ben, and with whom the faid William Forbes
</p>

</p>
<p>ready to aflift when the troops came ; that examinant believes the lift was
</p>
<p>given to Gilbert Forbes to be fent to the Governour, for that the name

<p>The Chairman aflced Mr. Martin if he chofe to be confidered as a

<p>arms.
</p>
<p>Mr. Martin being afked whether, in his opinion, the Britifh Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment has a right to tax America, he replied that, in his opinion, the Par-
</p>
<p>liament has not a right to lay internal taxes on the Colonies. Being
</p>
<p>afked whether he did not think a tax on perfonal eftates was equally
</p>
<p>unconftitutional, he replied that he did not, if it was for the regulation of
</p>
<p>trade ; but that he is not a politician, and has confined his ftudies to his
</p>
<p>own profeflion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Martin when afked whether he would give fecurity that he would
</p>
<p>not oppofe or contravene the meafures of the Continental Congrefs or of
</p>
<p>the Congrefs of this Colony. He replied that he would, but that he did
</p>
<p>not know of any perfon in this city to apply to to be his fecurity, that he
</p>
<p>would apply to his father, who refides on Long-IJland, who would be his

<p>David Matthews, Efq., Mayor of the City of New-York, being exam-
</p>
<p>ined, faith : That about fix or feven weeks ago the examinant went on
</p>
<p>board the Dutcbefs-of-Gordon, by permiffion of General Putnam, to
</p>
<p>obtain from the Governour permiiTion for Lord Drummond to go to Ber-
</p>
<p>muda ; that as the examinant was about to leave the Dutcbefs, the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernour took him into his private room, and put a bundle of paper money
</p>
<p>into his hands, telling examinant to take out five pounds and give it to the
</p>
<p>prifoners in the Jail, and pay the remainder to Gilbert Forbes, for fome
</p>
<p>rifles and round-bored guns which he had made for him, and for others
</p>
<p>which the faid Forbes was to make, and to tell Forbes that he did not
</p>
<p>want any more rifles ; that this examinant was furprifed to hear that the
</p>
<p>faid Forbes was engaged in that bufinefs, and at the fame time thought
</p>
<p>that Governour Tryon had put a matter on his fhoulders which might
</p>
<p>bring him into fome difficulty ; that the examinant, on his return to this
</p>
<p>city, confulted a friend of his, telling him that he would mention a mat-
</p>
<p>ter to him which he believed would furprife him ; and then informed
</p>
<p>him that Gilbert Forbes had fupplied the Governour with a number of
</p>
<p>arms, and was employed in that bufinefs ; and that examinant had
</p>
<p>brought up the monev to pay him, at the fame time mentioning that he
</p>
<p>thought the Governour had put a hard talk on his fhoulders; that examin-
</p>
<p>ant then advifed with him what he fhould do, and afked him whether
</p>
<p>he would take the money and endeavor to convey it to him privately,
</p>
<p>which he declined doing, and faid that he would mention the matter fo to
</p>
<p>Gilbert Forbes as that he would be able to determine by his anfwers
</p>
<p>whether he was the man ; that to this examinant confented ; that examin-
</p>
<p>ant, after leaving his friend, concluded that it would be beft not to pay
</p>
<p>the faid money to Forbes, but to delay it as long as poffible, that in cafe of a
</p>
<p>difcoverv, the examinant might avail himfelf of not having paid, although
</p>
<p>he had received the faid money ; that fhortly after Forbes called on this
</p>
<p>examinant, and told him that he had been defired by the gentleman to
</p>
<p>whom this examinant had mentioned it, to call on him for the money
</p>
<p>examinant had received for him of Governour Tryon; that examinant then
</p>
<p>afked him if it were poffible that he had been fending guns on board the
</p>
<p>Governour's fliip ; to which he anfwered in the affirmative ; that examin-

<p>ant then told him he would be hanged if he was found out, and requefted
</p>
<p>him, if he regarded his fafety, that he would not go on with fuch fchemes j
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>( 75 )
</p>
<p>that he faid he could fend them on board in fuch a way that nobody-
</p>
<p>could find it out ; that he had fent them on board in a canoe or boat,
</p>
<p>covered with a ftraw bed, and two or three old chairs upon it ; that he
</p>
<p>then afked examinant to pay him the money ; to which examinant
</p>
<p>anfwered, that he was to receive money, and as foon as he got it, he
</p>
<p>would pay it to him ; on which they parted ; that a few days after he
</p>
<p>called on examinant again to know whether examinant had received the
</p>
<p>money, for that he wanted it very much ; examinant told him he had not ;
</p>
<p>and the better to account for delays, the examinant had recourfe to this
</p>
<p>fubterfuge, that the Governour had given him pofitive orders not to
</p>
<p>receive any payments for him but in York or Jerfey money ; that with
</p>
<p>this he feemed pleafed, and requefted examinant to pay him in that
</p>
<p>money, becaufe with it he could purchafe certain articles neceffary in his
</p>
<p>bufinefs cheaper than with any other ; that he then informed examinant
</p>
<p>that he had a number of men whom he wanted to fend down to the
</p>
<p>Governour; that examinant told him that he might fave himfelf that trou-
</p>
<p>ble?, for that the Governour had told this examinant that he had been
</p>
<p>obliged to turn manv on fhore, and could not receive any more ; on
</p>
<p>which Forbes exprefTed fome concern as to what he fhould do with them;
</p>
<p>on which examinant defired him to tell the men to go to their homes
</p>
<p>and drop any fuch fchemes ; that fhortly after the faid Forbes again
</p>
<p>called on this examinant for the money, and mentioned a fcheme of raif
</p>
<p>ing a company, and requefted to know whether he could have a commif-
</p>
<p>fion; that examinant, on this, begged of him to defift from fuch a
</p>
<p>fcheme, for that he would certainly be difcovered, and the gallows would
</p>
<p>be his lot, and that it would be time enough for him to inlift men or
</p>
<p>aft when he got his commiffion ; that he faid he could carry it on fo as
</p>
<p>not to be found out, and that he could inlift a number of the General's
</p>
<p>Guards; that on this they parted; that this examinant then found out
</p>
<p>that Mr. Forbes became fo troublefome to him that, in order to get out
</p>
<p>of his way and ftave off the payment aforefaid, this examinant kept more
</p>
<p>in the country than he would otherwife have done ; then, on Forbes find-
</p>
<p>ing this, he purfued examinant up to Flatbujb, and not finding him there,
</p>
<p>purfued him to Polbemus, about four miles from Jamaica, in order to

</p>
<p>of him, told him that on Monday examinant would come to town and
</p>
<p>pay
</p>
<p>( 76 )
</p>
<p>pay him his money, which was accordingly done, viz : one hundred and
</p>
<p>fourteen pounds eight millings, and examinant then hoped that he mould
</p>
<p>not be plagued with him any more ; that the next day examinant again
</p>
<p>came to town, and had been in his houfe but a tew minutes when Forbes
</p>
<p>came into examinant's office ; that examinant told him he mult never
</p>
<p>come into examinant's office any more, on which he went away without
</p>
<p>faying a word; that John Young, the examinant's clerk, was prefent
</p>
<p>and then in the faid office, and that examinant has not feen the faid
</p>
<p>Forbes fince ; that at the time when the faid Forbes called on the ex-
</p>
<p>aminant as aforefaid, he mentioned to this examinant a fcheme he had
</p>
<p>of taking pofTeffion of one of the batteries when the fleet arrived, and
</p>
<p>another fcheme of cutting down King's bridge ; that this examinant
</p>
<p>defired his friend above-mentioned to advife and beg the faid Forbes to
</p>
<p>defift from the faid meafures and give them over; that this examinant
</p>
<p>has never fince or before received from Governour Tryon any other fum
</p>
<p>whatever for any fuch purpofes whatever. That fhortly before the time
</p>
<p>when this examinant paid the afore-faid money to the faid Forbes, this
</p>
<p>examinant was at WaldroyPs Ferry, Handing near John Carpenter's
</p>
<p>floop, and that the faid Forbes, being in company with one Sergeant
</p>
<p>Graham, turned off from faid Graham and came up to this examinant;
</p>
<p>that this examinant afked him where he had been ; he anfwered that he
</p>
<p>had been to look at all the fortifications ; examinant afked him whether
</p>
<p>he was not afraid of being taken up by the fentries, to which he replied
</p>
<p>that he was not, for that he could go there whenever he pleafed. That
</p>
<p>about the time when this examinant paid the money aforefaid to Forbes,
</p>
<p>this examinant being in office, a man in regimentals came in, which
</p>
<p>alarmed this examinant ; that he afked him whether he wanted this ex-

<p>aminant ; he afked examinant whether he was the Mayor, to which
</p>
<p>examinant replied he was, and afked him what he wanted ; he obferved

<p>to this examinant, that examinant did not know him, for that he had

<p>never feen him before ; examinant faid he did not know him ; he told

<p>examinant he was one of General Wafiington's Guards, and meant to

</p>
<p>Captain Archibald Hamilton, attending on the fummons, returnable
</p>
<p>here this day, was called in.
</p>
<p>The Chairman informed Captain Hamilton of the reafons of his being
</p>
<p>fo fummoned, and read to him the refolutions of Congrefs relative to per-
</p>
<p>fons of equivocal character, and told him he was confidered as of that
</p>
<p>number ; and that the Committee hoped he would give them fatisfactory
</p>
<p>evidence of his being a friend to America.
</p>
<p>Captain Hamilton thereupon obferved that he loved America : that he
</p>
<p>fought and bled and been in irons for her ; that he wifhes her free and
</p>
<p>happy ; and that no promifes or offers of reward or preferment could
</p>
<p>tempt him to draw his fword againft her ; that he has refufed fuch offers,
</p>
<p>and that he holds no office or commiflion whatever under the King of
</p>
<p>Great Britain ; that he has a brother and other near relations now ferv-
</p>
<p>ing in the King's armies, and that he could not think of unfheathing his
</p>
<p>fword againft them or the King.
</p>
<p>Captain Hamilton, on being afked by the chairman, whether, in his
</p>
<p>opinion, the Parliament of Great Britain have a right to bind thefe
</p>
<p>Colonies in all cafes whatfoever; faid he was not fufficiently acquainted
</p>
<p>with fubjefts of that kind to anfwer the queftion ; but that if he had twenty
</p>
<p>hearts, he would fooner lofe the blood in them all than lofe his liberty.
</p>
<p>The chairman then afked him whether he would give his parole of
</p>
<p>honour neither directly nor indirectly to oppofe or contravene the mea-
</p>
<p>fures of the Continental Congrefs or the Congrefs of this Colony ; to
</p>
<p>which he anfwered that he would very readily, for that he never would
</p>
<p>injure America in word, thought, or deed.
</p>
<p>Captain Hamilton was then defired to withdraw, and the committee
</p>
<p>proceeded to take his cafe into confideration. The refult of which was,

<p>that they
</p>
<p>Refolved
</p>
<p>(87)
</p>
<p>Refolved, That Captain Hamilton was not fuch a friend to the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can caufe as is defcribed in the faid resolutions of the Congrefs ; that it
</p>
<p>was unneccfTary that he fhould be removed from the place of his prefent
</p>
<p>refidence ; that confidence might be repofed in him as a man of honour;
</p>
<p>and therefore that his parole was fufficient fecurity for his not oppofing or
</p>
<p>contravening the meafures of the Continental Congrefs or the Congrefs of
</p>
<p>this Colony.
</p>
<p>Captain Hamilton was then called in, and on his agreeing to give
</p>
<p>fuch parole, it was reduced to writing, and, on his figning it, was
</p>
<p>difcharged.
</p>
<p>New-York, June 24, 1776.
</p>
<p>I, Archibald Hamilton, Efq., do declare upon my honour that I will
</p>
<p>not, direftly or indirectly, oppofe or contravene the meafures of the Con-
</p>
<p>tinental Congrefs or of the Congrefs of this Colony.

<p>John rates, of the Wallkill Precinct, in Uljler County, labourer, being
</p>
<p>fworn, faith : That early in this laft fpring Alfalom Bull, one of depo-
</p>
<p>nent's neighbours, came to him and told him he was but a poor man, and
</p>
<p>that if he would go with the faid Bull, he would make a gentleman of
</p>
<p>this deponent. That this deponent afked him how. He replied that if
</p>
<p>this deponent would go and fcrve the King for three years, or to the end
</p>
<p>of the American war if that mould fooner happen, this deponent fhould
</p>
<p>have two hundred acres of land on the frontiers. That deponent faid it
</p>
<p>was very uncertain, for he did not fee how he was to get a warranty deed
</p>
<p>for it j but if he could get a warranty deed for two hundred acres of land,
</p>
<p>he did not know but he might engage. On this they parted. That for
</p>
<p>many days repeatedly after that, the faid Abfalom Bull, together with
</p>
<p>Ifaac Waugh and Richard Bull, came to this deponent and preffed him
</p>
<p>to enter into the King's fervice, but the deponent put them off. That
</p>
<p>they afterwards went, as they informed this deponent, on board the man-
</p>
<p>of-war, and when they returned, brought him a letter from Governour
</p>
<p>Tryon, informing this deponent that if he would come on board his fhip
</p>
<p>and pilot the men-of-war up the North River, he would give this depo-
</p>
<p>nent a dollar a day and five pounds a foot for every foot that the veflcl

</p>
<p>acres of land at the determination of the American war ; and that Ireland,

<p>Scotland and Wales had all united with England to fubdue America.
</p>
<p>That this deponent had, till within a few years laft part, been a feafaring
</p>
<p>man, and was well acquainted with the navigation of the North River,
</p>
<p>which was well known to his faid neighbours, and, as this deponent be-
</p>
<p>lieves, was by them made known to Governour Tryon. That this
</p>
<p>deponent afterwards received two other letters of the like import, from
</p>
<p>Governour Tryon. That about fix weeks ago this deponent, together
</p>
<p>with the faid Abjalom Bull, Richard Bull, and Ifaac JVaugh, travelled
</p>
<p>from their homes down through Weftcheder County to White-Stone
</p>
<p>Ferry, where they croffed over to Long-IJIand, and thence to Hempftead,
</p>
<p>and went to the houfe of one Simon/on, a tavern-keeper, in that town ;
</p>
<p>that they went from thence to the houfe of Captain Hulet, where they all
</p>
<p>lodged ; that the next morning this deponent's companions went ofF from
</p>
<p>Rockaway in an oyfter-boat that plied between that coaft and the fhips,
</p>
<p>and fupplied them with provifions, as he was informed and believed ;
</p>
<p>that they defired this deponent to go with them, but this deponent being
</p>
<p>fick, and not much inclined to go on board, faid he would wait at
</p>
<p>Captain Hulet's till their return ; that after three days they all returned
</p>
<p>to this deponent at Captain Hulet's, aforefaid, and that Colonel Fanning,
</p>
<p>the Governour's fecretary, came with them ; that the faid Colonel Fan-
</p>
<p>ning was well known to this deponent, he having often feen him, and this
</p>
<p>deponent having been a mariner in Captain Hunter's fhip, which
</p>
<p>brought the Colonel from England ; that at prefent this deponent did not
</p>
<p>know Colonel Fanning, he being difguifed in the drefs of a common
</p>
<p>labouring man, but on taking this deponent afide he made himfelf known
</p>
<p>to him, whereupon this deponent immediately recollected his face and
</p>
<p>perfon ; that he afked this deponent to go on board with him ; this de-
</p>
<p>ponent anfwered that he was too fick to go ; that then the Colonel told
</p>
<p>him that if he could not go then, he muft come down when the fleet ar-
</p>
<p>rived, and that they would fend this deponent a letter to inform him of it,
</p>
<p>to which this deponent agreed. That Colonel Fanning told him New-

<p>them, and that cannon was already provided in different parts of Long-
</p>
<p>IJland, and that there were then three field-pieces and a mortar-piece
</p>
<p>under the floor of the barn of the faid Simonfon. The faid C
</p>
<p>Fanning alfo told this deponent that they fhould want him to pilot veflels
</p>
<p>of war up the North River, and that the Savage, Phenix, and Sbuldan

</p>
<p>figncd for that fervice. That the Colonel defired this deponent to bring

<p>That this examinant has figned the firft AfTociation, and has no ob-

</p>
<p>ponent if he knew John Hulet and Richard Hulet ; deponent faid he did,
</p>
<p>particularly "John, for deponent's brother had married his daughter ; that
</p>
<p>the faid Vernon thereupon fpoke very freely to this deponent on the fub-
</p>
<p>jel of politicks, and faid he would be damned if the fleet did not come
</p>
<p>foon and let them all out; he confefTed to this deponent that he had feveral
</p>
<p>times been on board the Dutchefs-of-Gordon, where he had feen Richard
</p>
<p>Hulet and Thomas Cornell ; that he alfo feen Governour Tryon often, and
</p>

<p>faid Vernon alfo told this deponent that he had, by Governour Tryon's
</p>
<p>order, engaged with Dawkins, an engraver, who had been taken up on a
</p>
<p>charge of counterfeiting money, to go on board the Dutchefs and cut
</p>
<p>money plates for the Governour, and that the Governour was to give the
</p>
<p>faid Dawkins a hundred pounds for his trouble ; and that the faid Vernon
</p>
<p>was to have carried him on board had not Dawkins got drunk and told
</p>
<p>him that he (the faid Vernon) was going to carry him on board, which being
</p>
<p>made known to him (the faid Vernon), he was afraid to attempt carrying

<p>Dawkins before, that Dawkins left his cheft open, and that he, (Vernon)
</p>
<p>intending to take fomething out of his cheft and make him treat him for
</p>
<p>giving it to him again, opened the cheft and found in it a plate to ftrike
</p>
<p>Pennfylvania money, and kept it near a week ; that Dazvkins when he
</p>
<p>mifled it, was very uneafy, and he (the faid Vernon) again delivered it to
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>This deponent further fays : That when Thomas Hickey and Michae/f
</p>
<p>Lynch, of the General's Guards, were apprehended for money-making, they
</p>
<p>were confined in the fame room with this deponent ; that they then curfed
</p>
<p>and fwore a great deal and damned themfelves if they would ever fight any
</p>
<p>more for America ; that this deponent talked Tory with them, and by
</p>
<p>that means they came to confide in him ; that Hickey and Lynch faid
</p>
<p>there were near feven hundred men inlifted for the King, and that the
</p>
<p>night before the fleet arrived they were to have notice of it, that they were
</p>
<p>to repair towards Kings Bridge and join them ; and that fome of the

</p>
<p>( ioi )
</p>
<p>fome of them, the faid Hickey and Lynch feemed to be a good deal un-
</p>
<p>eafy, but they comforted themfelves in this : Lynch faid they had not got
</p>
<p>his name, for it was gone on board the man-of-war, and Hickey faid if
</p>
<p>they had got his name it was not of his writing, and therefore neither of
</p>
<p>them could be hurt. Lynch further faid that if the guards came to be a
</p>
<p>little thinner he would make his efcape through the windows.

<p>ant exerted himfelf in that buhnefs and raifed a number of men, he mould

<p>have a company ; that the faid Sergeant alfo informed him that, at the
</p>
<p>requeft of the Governour, he had furveyed the ground and works about
</p>
<p>this city and on Long-IJland, in confequence of which he had concerted
</p>
<p>a plan for an attack, which he had given to Governour Tryon, and of
</p>
<p>which the Governour approved, which was as follows, viz : that the man-
</p>
<p>of-war mould cannonade the battery at Red Hook, and while that was
</p>
<p>doing a detachment of the Army, with fome cannon, &c, mould land be-
</p>
<p>low or about Red Hook, and march round fo as to come upon the back
</p>
<p>of the batteries, near Swedeland Houfe ; that a fmall part of the detach-
</p>
<p>ment fhould make a feint of marching up the road leading direftly to the
</p>
<p>battery, but the main body were to make a circuitous march fo as to
</p>
<p>reach the battery while our attention was engaged by the feint aforefaid ;

<p>they
</p>
<p>( 102 )
</p>
<p>they were immediately to attack the battery on the hill near the ferry,
</p>
<p>which the Sergeant faid would be eafily done, as no embrafures were
</p>
<p>made or cannon fixed on the back fide of it ; that this latter battery, when
</p>
<p>in their pofleflion, would command the works on Governour's Ifland,
</p>
<p>which they would keep between two fires, viz : the battery laft men-
</p>
<p>tioned on the one fide, and the fhipping on the other ; that then the
</p>
<p>fhipping, with the remainder of the Army, were to divide, one divifion
</p>
<p>was to run up the North River and land at or near about Clarke's farm,
</p>
<p>and march directly to Enclenbergh Hall, and fortify there ; the other di-
</p>
<p>vifion was to run up the Eajl River and land in fuch manner as to gain
</p>
<p>a footing on Jones's Hill, from whence they expected to command and
</p>
<p>filence the battery on Bayard's Hill ; that fhould they gain pofleflion of
</p>
<p>the places above-mentioned, their next object would be the grounds ad-
</p>
<p>jacent to King's Bridge, where they intend to eredl ftrong works,
</p>
<p>fo as to cut off the communication between the city and country.
</p>
<p>Gilbert Forbes, being further examined, faith : That fome time before
</p>
<p>the man-of-war removed from the town to the Narrows, one Webb, a
</p>
<p>burr-millftone maker, told examinant that if he had any rifles to fell he
</p>
<p>might get a good price for them by fending them on board the man-of-
</p>
<p>war, and that a young man who lived with James Rivington told him the
</p>
<p>fame ; that this examinant had then nine rifles, which he made, but they
</p>
<p>were bad and would not fhoot llraight, and eleven fmooth narrow-bored
</p>
<p>guns ; that he fent fome of them to one Mrs. Beck's, a tavern-keeper, near
</p>
<p>the Fly Market, with orders to fend them on board, which fhe according
</p>
<p>did, and that the faid Webb carried the remainder ; that the faid Webb
</p>
<p>told this examinant that Governour Tryon would give him three guineas
</p>
<p>apiece for them ; that at the time when an exchange of prifoners took
</p>
<p>place with the man-of-war, and Lilly was, among others, exchanged, the
</p>
<p>Mayor, viz : David Matthews, Efq., fent for this examinant and told him
</p>
<p>he was going on board the Governour's flap, and that he would get the
</p>
<p>money due from the Governour to this examinant for the rifles aforefaid ;
</p>
<p>that on his return the Mayor told this examinant he would pay him in a
</p>
<p>few days ; that this examinant never did receive any money from him
</p>
<p>for the faid fire-arms ; that this examinant told Charles Ben/on that he

<p>A cafe ftated by the Committee appointed by the Congrcfs of this
</p>
<p>Colony
</p>
<p>( io6 )
</p>
<p>Colony to carry into execution their Refolutions of the 5 th day of June
</p>
<p>inftant, relative to perfons inimical to the caufe and rights of America,
</p>
<p>and thofe of equivocal character : A. B., holding an honorary office
</p>
<p>from the King of Great-Britain, and being a gentleman of fortune, was
</p>
<p>fummoned to appear before your Committee, and appeared at the time
</p>
<p>and place for that purpofe appointed.
</p>
<p>On his appearance before your faid Committee, the Chairman informed
</p>
<p>him of the Refolutions of this Congrefs as to perfons of equivocal cha-
</p>
<p>racter, and defired him to give evidence of his being a friend to the
</p>
<p>American caufe. The gentleman appealed to the uniform tenour of his
</p>
<p>conduct, which he faid, had never been unfriendly to his country.
</p>
<p>Being then afked whether he approves of the American oppofition, he
</p>
<p>replied that he did not on the whole, and fignified a difapprobation of
</p>
<p>the Canada expedition. On being aflced whether the Parliament of
</p>
<p>Great Britain, in his opinion, have a right to bind thefe Colonies in all
</p>
<p>cafes whatfoever, he faid that, in his opinion, they had not ; that he fully
</p>
<p>approved of the firfl part of the Aflbciation refolved on by this Congrefs
</p>
<p>on the 20th day of June, inftant. On being aflced whether a refiftance,
</p>
<p>by arms, to the hoftile attempts of the Britijh fleets and armies to en-
</p>
<p>force and execute their claims and demands was juftifiable, he declined
</p>
<p>to give an anfwer, but declared that the bulk of his fortune was in Great
</p>
<p>Britain and the Weft Indies, and that he did not mean to take an active
</p>
<p>part on either fide.
</p>
<p>Your Committee thereupon refolved that he is not fuch a friend to the
</p>
<p>American caufe as is defcribed in your faid refolutions of the 5th inftant;
</p>
<p>that his removal from his prefent place of refidence was unneceflary ; and
</p>
<p>that his parole, in the words directed by your faid refolutions, was fuffi-
</p>
<p>cient fecurity.
</p>
<p>The gentleman afligned objections to give his parole, and faid he would
</p>
<p>fubmit to fuch a difpofition of him as your Committee fhould make. He
</p>
<p>then had two days allowed him to confider of the faid parole, at which
</p>
<p>time he returned to your faid Committee.
</p>
<p>On his return to your Committee the gentleman was of the fame
</p>
<p>opinion as before, and faid he could not confent to give his parole " not

<p>to oppofe or contravene the meafures of the Continental Congrefs or the
</p>
<p>Congrefs

<p>( io 7 )
</p>
<p>Congrefs of this Colony ; " as his giving or figning fuch parole might, in
</p>
<p>his apprehenfion, be conftrued on the other fide of the water to be an
</p>
<p>overt adl, and made ufe of to forfeit his eftate there.
</p>
<p>The gentleman offered to your Committee to give his parole not to
</p>
<p>take any aftive part againft this country, or do anything inconfiftent with
</p>
<p>the duty of a good citizen.
</p>
<p>He further voluntarily offered that if it was thought necefTary that he
</p>
<p>fhould remove from his prefent place of refidence, he was willing to
</p>
<p>move with his family to any County in the Colony, and to have limits
</p>
<p>affigned to him ; but intimated that it would be difagreeable to him to
</p>
<p>remove out of the Colony. He alfo informed your Committee that if
</p>
<p>his whole eftate was in the American Colonies only he would not hefitate
</p>
<p>to determine the matter, and fully exprefs his fentiments, which in his
</p>
<p>opinion, it is not proper for him to do in the prefent fituation of his
</p>
<p>affairs.
</p>
<p>Your Committee believe the gentleman to be a man of high honour
</p>
<p>and integrity ; and have not the leaft doubt but that any parole which he
</p>
<p>will confent to give, he will hold facred and perform : and he is to attend
</p>
<p>your Committee again on notice. But in the execution of the faid re-
</p>
<p>folves they have now no alternative but a warrant and force againft the
</p>
<p>gentleman, and confinement. The policy of this meafure your Com-
</p>
<p>mittee fubmit to Congrefs, and requeft their directions in the premifes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Nathaniel Underhill :
</p>
<p>Whereas, by certain refolutions of the Congrefs of the Colony j of

<p>New-York, of the 5th day of June inftant, we, a Committee of the faid
