</p>
<p>DEDICATION".
</p>
<p>Individuality irresistibly exerts itself, during the process of crys-
</p>
<p>tallization of the widely gathered human elements into an organ-
</p>
<p>ized community. The simmering, seething mixture is precipitated
</p>
<p>into solidity and forms about the fixed metal of individual character.
</p>
<p>The moral, religious and mental tone of a community is attuned in
</p>
<p>harmonious accord with the perfected rhythm of individual devel-
</p>
<p>opment.
</p>
<p>It was most fortunate as contributing to its present proud position,
</p>
<p>that inthe formation of the State, now enclosing within its bounds,
</p>
<p>and near its Capitol City, the central point of population of our
</p>
<p>Union, such men there lived as Dr. Isaac Coe, James M. Ray, Eben-
</p>
<p>ezer Sharpe, James Blake, Nicholas McCarty, Calvin Fletcher,
</p>
<p>Morris Morris, Eev. William A. Holliday, Austin W. Morris, Dan-
</p>
<p>iel Yandes and Samuel Merrill.
</p>
<p>I record only the names of those who have made their lives object
</p>
<p>lessons within my own remembrance, and have passed in person from
</p>
<p>view, but yet live honored in loving memory. Under their in-
</p>
<p>fluence, both in private and public transactions, moral considera-
</p>
<p>tions were recognized as "limitations" even upon the right of con-
</p>
<p>tract ; and public policy was ever what best served private virtue
</p>
<p>and public honor. These good men lived not for themselves, but
</p>
<p>that others might rightly live. United and loved in life, now
</p>
<p>crowned in our memory, they rest together peacefully from their
</p>
<p>labors upon "Crown Hill," overlooking the city they loved.
</p>
<p>Let not the limit of their lives, contract the circle of their in-
</p>
<p>fluence.

<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>Wliile the law recognizes that commercial prosperity requires
</p>
<p>that every one of full age and reasonable discretion should have
</p>
<p>almost unlimited freedom in entering into contracts, and that all
</p>
<p>engagements thus freely and fairly entered into should be held
</p>
<p>sacred and enforceable in law, and all equitable rights growing
</p>
<p>out of such engagements should be given full effect; yet there are
</p>
<p>limitations upon this right to contract which the security of
</p>
<p>society and the protection of individual rights render it imperative
</p>
<p>that the law making power should impose, and that courts should
</p>
<p>render effective.
</p>
<p>It is true that public policy is uncertain and fluctuating  chang-
</p>
<p>ing with the enlarged demands of commerce and the usages of
</p>
<p>trade  and that even in morals, the test is not uniform, the inno-
</p>
<p>cent wager of the ancient common law, becoming the gambling
</p>
<p>contract of to-day; and the illegal sale of property to which no
</p>
<p>title exists, becoming, in turn, the reliance of both producer and
</p>
<p>manufacturer; the latter indeed purchasing futures in cotton and
</p>
<p>in grain, that he may enter into contract for the delivery of the
</p>
<p>product at fi: :ed and remunerative prices, thus creating for the
</p>
<p>producer a present market for future dehvery.
</p>
<p>But it still stands true, that whatever contract conflicts with the
</p>
<p>moral sentiment of the times, or contravenes any established exist-
</p>
<p>ing interest of society, social, commercial or political, is void,
</p>
<p>as against public policy. By this test must all Contracts, Trade
</p>
<p>Agreements and Strikes, and all Corporate or Partnership Trusts
</p>
<p>and Combinations be judged. It is the purpose of this work to
</p>
<p>bring them all to this judgment.

<p>The common law will not permit individuals to legally place

<p>in its inception, as imperiling the public health.' A contract by
</p>
<p>which a teleplione company agrees to give a telegraph company
</p>
<p>the exclusive use for a term of years of the telephone for receiving
</p>
<p>and transmiting telegraph messages is void as limiting public use,
</p>
<p>and therefore against public policy.* A man's contract to give
</p>
<p>another the first right to purchase the interest of his deceased
</p>
<p>wife's estate in school lands, as soon as administration is had npon
</p>
<p>the estate, is contrary to public policy and void, where he had no

<p>power to bind the estate.^
</p>
<p>Where property of large value, both real and personal, is incum-
</p>
<p>bered with mortgages or other liens to an amount sometliing like

<p>its value, so that there remains in the owner but an equity of
</p>
<p>redemption of trifling value; and a creditor at execution sale, or
</p>
<p>otherwise, buys at a small price such equity, with a view to re-
</p>
<p>demption from the liens, a court of equity will lend its aid to put
</p>
<p>him in a position where he may safely redeem; but where such pur-
</p>
<p>chase is purely speculative, simply in fact to trade upon the chances
</p>
<p>of successfully attacking transfers of large property, made for the
</p>
<p>benefit of creditors, and with the view of depriving them of the
</p>
<p>benefits of such transfers, it is a case where equity, true to its
</p>
<p>ideas of substantial justice, refuses to be bound by the letter of
</p>
<p>legal procedure, or to lend its aid to a mere speculative purchase
</p>
<p>which threatens injury and ruin to a large body of honest credit-
</p>
<p>ors, who have trusted for the payment of their debts to the legal
</p>
<p>validity of proceedings theretofore taken.*
</p>
<p>JSTothing can call a court of equity into activity but conscience and
</p>
<p>good faith toward the public and individuals, and reasonable dil-

<p>nothing.*

<p>4 LIMITATIONS UPON THE EIGHT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>If a contract be unreasonable and unconscionable, but not void
</p>
<p>for fraud, a court of law will give to the party who sues for its
</p>
<p>breach damages, not according to its letter, but only such as he is
</p>
<p>equitably entitled to;' for one who has been led into a contract upon
</p>
<p>which lie has received something of value cannot ignore the con-
</p>
<p>tract, however induced, and proceed as if the relations of the parties
</p>
<p>were wholly unaffected thereby, and cannot while retaining its
</p>
<p>benefits and thus affirming the contract, treat it as though it did
</p>
<p>not exist.^
</p>
<p>One kind of unfairness which stays the interference of the court
</p>
<p>arises where the enforcement of the contract would be injurious
</p>
<p>to third parties.'
</p>
<p>A contract obtained under circumstances which are not fair and
</p>
<p>honest cannot be enforced in equity.'
</p>
<p>Thus, where an illiterate man signs a writing which has been
</p>
<p>falsely read to him, he cannot be compelled to execute it.^
</p>
<p>A sale will be set aside at the petition of a vendor not guilty of
</p>
<p>laches under 'the circumstances in which he acted, who has been
</p>
<p>induced to sell, at an inadequate price, property at a great distance
</p>
<p>from his residence, and of the value of which he was ignorant, by
</p>
<p>the false representations as to such value of a purchaser who has
</p>
<p>secured his trust and confidence for this purpose and who is fully
</p>
<p>informed as to such value and acquainted with the property, but
</p>
<p>does not disclose the facts respecting it."
</p>
<p>Nor can there be any contract enforceable in a court, where a
</p>
<p>physical act of concurrence therein has been coerced through du-
</p>
<p>ress or imprisonment; and a threat followed by fear of its execu-

<p>under its influence.'
</p>
<p>So if a person be in pecuniary distress so that he would be dis-
</p>
<p>posed to make an undue sacrifice, and advantage is taken of his
</p>
<p>condition to obtain from him a contract for an insufficient consid-
</p>
<p>eration, he will be relieved therefrom.''
</p>
<p>And a settlement and release obtained by threats and menaces
</p>
<p>from a creditor of a weak mind is invalid.'
</p>
<p>Where the direct purpose of the engagement is in itself unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful, the contract is incapable of enforcement;* and a contract
</p>
<p>whose invalidity is caused by its stipulating for the commission of
</p>
<p>an act forbidden by law at the time when it is to be done, cannot
</p>
<p>be ratified, even after a change in the law has rendered the doing
</p>
<p>of the act not unlawful.'

<p>A court will not sit to take an accounting between two rob-

<p>part of whatever remuneration the attorney receives for his ser-

<p>vices from the litigant, is contrary to public policy and void.'
</p>
<p>Nor can an attorney contract for a monthly compensation, to
</p>
<p>defend all cases brought against his employers, engaged in the
</p>
<p>illegal sale of liquor, for future violations of law.*

<p> 2. What are Contracts which Invade such Interests. 
</p>
<p>Contracts violating, or whatever, even in spirit, is in violation
</p>
<p>of a statute, or obstructs justice, or is against good morals (includ-
</p>
<p>ing contracts injuriously affecting the marriage relation and wager-
</p>
<p>ing contracts), or is in restraint of liberty of commerce, or of
</p>
<p>natural or of legal right, comes within this prohibition and is

<p>void.'
</p>
<p>The surrender of letters and telegrams of the maker of a note?
</p>
<p>and of a protested check given in payment of a gambling debt,
</p>
<p>constitutes an insufficient consideration for a note."
</p>
<p>All contracts against the pohcy of the law and such as contra-

</p>
<p>Immoral.  An entire contract, which is founded upon a consid-

<p>and prostitution are illegal and void, as being against public mor-
</p>
<p>ality/
</p>
<p>A warrant of attorney, given to induce a plaintiff to live in
</p>
<p>prostitution with the defendant, is void, and will be decreed to be
</p>
<p>given np.'
</p>
<p>A woman living by agreement with a man as his wife cannot,
</p>
<p>after his marriage, recover in assumpsit for services and money
</p>
<p>contributed towards family expenses during such unlawful rela-
</p>
<p>tion, even if there was express promise to pay/
</p>
<p>But an agreement by defendant to allow plaintiff, with whom
</p>
<p>he cohabited, in case they should separate, an annuity for life,
</p>
<p>provided she should continue single, is a valid agreement/
</p>
<p>So a bond given in consideration of past cohabitation is good ; *
</p>
<p>but a bond for cohabitation with a woman seduced by the

<p>obligor, for maintenance after his death, is void."
</p>
<p>Past seduction and cohabitation have been held not a good con-

<p>defendant as his mistress, and that it was agreed that no further

<p>immoral connection should take place between them, and that
</p>
<p>defendant should allow her an annuity as long as she should con-

<p>tinue of good and virtuous life and demeanor, it was held that
</p>
<p>there was no good consideration, it not being averred that defend-
</p>
<p>ant was the seducer, and there is no authority to show that past

<p>cohabitation alone, or the ceasing to cohabit in the future, is a

<p>8 LIMITATIONS UPON THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>tract under some circumstances. The Code of Georgia ( 2741)
</p>
<p>expressly recognizes a strong moral obligation as a consideration
</p>
<p>for a contract; and there is no reason for conhning this to executed
</p>
<p>contracts.
</p>
<p>Thus a contract to make compensation for past illegal cohabi-
</p>
<p>tation, not contemplating its continuance, is legal.'
</p>
<p>An agreement by one partner who had become voluntarily dis-
</p>
<p>abled from service for the firm, made after dissolution, but before
</p>
<p>full settlement, to allow his copartner out of the assets a certain
</p>
<p>sum for past services, to compensate him for his own lack of
</p>
<p>services, is supported by a strong moral obligation, sufficient under
</p>
<p>Ga. Code,  2741, although it would not be valid at common law.*
</p>
<p>But in the absence of statute according to the common law, as now
</p>
<p>generally understood and administered, such an obligation would
</p>
<p>not suffice as a consideration for an executory promise.^ IS^either
</p>
<p>"love and affection," nor "blood relationship," nor "friendship,"
</p>
<p>nor any mere moral duty or obligation, nor any voluntary courtesy,
</p>
<p>it has been held, constitutes a sufficient consideration for a promise
</p>
<p>not under seal.* A mere moral obligation or duty already dis-
</p>
<p>charged is not a sufficient consideration to support a subsequent
</p>
<p>express promise to pay.*
</p>
<p>b. Good and Equitable Consideration.  The duty of a
</p>
<p>father is a sufficient consideration to support the gift of land by
</p>
<p>him to a third person for the benefit of his daughter; and such
</p>
<p>gift cannot thereafter be revoked or altered without the consent
</p>
<p>of the daughter.

<p>GOOD AND EQUITABLE CONSIDEKATION. 1>
</p>
<p>A conveyance of land made by a father for the benefit of his
</p>
<p>illegitimate child is upon a good consideration.' Natural affection
</p>
<p>is a good consideration for an executed contract." But a promise
</p>
<p>by a father to give his son a tract of land by his will, followed by
</p>
<p>expenditure in improvements, not, however, in execution of the
</p>
<p>contract or at the father's request, is without consideration, and
</p>
<p>cannot be enforced,^ and the natural affection of the father alone
</p>
<p>and his moral obligation and duty to provide for a bastard child,
</p>
<p>do not constitute a sufficient consideration to make him liable for
</p>
<p>its support, where there was no compromise ^vith the mother or
</p>
<p>any demand by her for a verbal promise to provide for the child.*
</p>
<p>But a deed made by a father for the benefit of his illegitimate
</p>
<p>child is upon a good consideration.'
</p>
<p>A promise by the father of an illegitimate child to the mother
</p>
<p>to pay her an annuity if she would maintain the child, is, <jn per-
</p>
<p>formance by the mother, founded on sufficient consideration.^
</p>
<p>A bond to pay an annuity to the mother of an illegitimate
</p>
<p>child, executed by the father, on condition that she should give
</p>
<p>him its custody or management, is given on good consideration.^
</p>
<p>A settlement and discontinuance of a prosecution for l)astardv
</p>
<p>and fornication is a good and legal consideration for a judo-ment
</p>
<p>note given by the reputed father to the mother of the child.'
</p>
<p>Where a man having a legal wife deceives another woman by
</p>
<p>a void marriage, and has children by her, the facts furnish a good
</p>
<p>consideration for the assignment to her of a mortgage security.'

<p>10 LIMITATIONS UPON THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>ing or playing cards or billiards for money, is decided a good con-
</p>
<p>sideration for a promise by his uncle to pay him a sum of money.
</p>
<p>The defendant there contends that the contract was without con-
</p>
<p>sideration to support it, and therefore invalid. He asserts that
</p>
<p>the promisee, by refraining from the use of liquor and tobacco,
</p>
<p>was not harmed, but benefited; that that which he did was best
</p>
<p>for him to do, independently of his uncle's promise,  and insisted
</p>
<p>that it followed that, unless the promisor was benefited, the con-
</p>
<p>tract was without consideration,  a contention which, if well
</p>
<p>founded, it is said, would seem to leave open for controversy in
</p>
<p>many cases whether that which the promisee did or omitted to
</p>
<p>do was in fact of such benefit to him as to leave no consideration
</p>
<p>to support the enforcement of the promisor's agreement. Such
</p>
<p>a rule the court said could not be tolerated, and is without foun-
</p>
<p>dation in the law. In Lacota v. Neioton (an unreported case in
</p>
<p>the superior court of Worcester, Mass.), the complaint averred
</p>
<p>defendant's promise that "if you [meaning the plaintiff] will leave
</p>
<p>off drinking for a year I will give 3'ou $100," plaintiff's assent
</p>
<p>thereto, performance of the condition by him, and it demanded
</p>
<p>judgment therefor. Defendant demurred, on the ground, among
</p>
<p>others, that the plaintiff's declaration did not allege a valid and
</p>
<p>sufficient consideration for the agreement of the defendant. The
</p>
<p>demurrer was overruled. In Talbott v. Stemmons (Ky.), 5 L. R.
</p>
<p>A. 856 (a Kentucky case, not yet oflficially reported), the step-
</p>
<p>grandmother of the plaintiff made with him the following agree-
</p>
<p>ment: "I do promise and bind myself to give my grandson
</p>
<p>Albert R. Talbott $500 at my death if he will never take another
</p>
<p>chew of tobacco or smoke another cigar during my life, from this
</p>
<p>dat^ up to my death; and if he breaks this pledge he is to refund
</p>
<p>double the amount to his mother." The executor of Mrs. Stem-
</p>
<p>mons demurred to the complaint on the ground that the agree-
</p>
<p>ment was not based on a sufficient consideration. The demurrer
</p>
<p>was, sustained, and an appeal taken therefrom to the Court of
</p>
<p>Appeals, where the decision of the court below was reversed. In

<p>the opinion of the court it is said that "the right to use and enjoy
</p>
<p>the use of tobacco was a right that belonged to the plaintiff, and
</p>
<p>not forbidden by law. The abandonment of its use may have
</p>
<p>saved him money, or contributed to his health; nevertheless, the
</p>
<p>MUTUAL PKOMISES. 11
</p>
<p>surrender of that right caused the promise, and, having the right
</p>
<p>to contract with reference to the subject matter, the abandonment
</p>
<p>of the use was a sufficient consideration to uphold the promise,"
</p>
<p>Abstinence from the use of intoxicating liquors was held to fur-
</p>
<p>nish a good consideration for a promissory note in Lindell v.
</p>
<p>EoTces. 60 Mo. 249. Certain cases sometimes cited on this ques-
</p>
<p>tion are not in point. In Mallory v. Gillett, 21 N. Y. 412; Bel-
</p>
<p>Jcnap V. Bender, T5 N.Y. 446, and Berry v. Broion, 9 Cent. Rep.
</p>
<p>:896, 107 N. Y. 659,  the promise was in contravention of that
</p>
<p>provision of the Statute of Frauds which declares void all promises
</p>
<p>to answer for the debts of third persons unless reduced to writing.
</p>
<p>A contract will be sustained if it rests upon an equitable considera-
</p>
<p>tion.' But no action can be maintained to enforce a gratuitous
</p>
<p>promise, however worthy the object in contemplation of the par-
</p>
<p>ties."
</p>
<p>c. Mutual Promises.  Contract must be mutually binding on
</p>
<p>the parties proposing to enter into it or it is void for want of
</p>
<p>mutuality.^
</p>
<p>But concurrent promises, resting the one upon the other, and
</p>
<p>creating a reciprocity of obligation, constitute a good considera-
</p>
<p>tion for each other.*
</p>
<p>Although a written agreement does not show upon its face that
</p>
<p>in the promises there is a mutuality of obligation or other consid-
</p>
<p>erations such mutuality or consideration may be proved by another
</p>
<p>written contract entered into at the same time, and shown to have
</p>
<p>been supported by an independent consideration, or treated in
</p>
<p>itself as a consideration for the former agreement.*
</p>
<p>An exchange of notes of aa equal amount made in good faith
</p>
<p>is based on a mutual and adequate consideration' and a promise to

</p>
<p>sell goods and a promise to purchase and to pay therefor are mutnal
</p>
<p>and concurrent.'
</p>
<p>A conveyance of property made to a firm, under which the
</p>
<p>firm acquires title to the property, which it treats as firm prop-
</p>
<p>erty, is an adequate consideration for a note on the firm made by
</p>
<p>one of the firm.^
</p>
<p>Where several mutually agree to pay money to be expended
</p>
<p>for a lawful object of common interest to the parties, the promise
</p>
<p>of each is considered as made in consideration of the promise of
</p>
<p>the others to contribute to the common object; and the fact that
</p>
<p>one promisor did not actively unite in subsequent acts, in advance-
</p>
<p>ment of tlie common object, done in the mode indicated in the
</p>
<p>contract of subscription, where he had due notice of all the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings and was invited to participate and did not object to the
</p>
<p>proceeding will not excuse his failure to pay.*
</p>
<p>In Vanderhilt v. ScJcreyer, 91 N. Y. 392, the plaintiff contracted
</p>
<p>with defendant to build a house, agreeing to accept in part pay-
</p>
<p>ment therefor a specific bond and mortgage. Afterwards he
</p>
<p>refused to finish his contract unless the defendant would guar-
</p>
<p>antee its payment, which was done. It was held that the guar-
</p>
<p>anty could not be enforced for want of consideration, for in build-
</p>
<p>ing the house the plaintiff only did that which he had contracted
</p>
<p>to do. And in liohinson v. Jewitt, 116 j^. Y. 40, the court simply
</p>
<p>held that " the performance of an act which the party is under a
</p>
<p>legal obligation to perform cannot constitute a consideration for a
</p>
<p>new contract."*
</p>
<p>Nor does a promise to pay a debt for which the promisor has
</p>
<p>already promised or is already bound, constitute a consideration
</p>
<p>sufficient to support a contract.*

<p>VALUABLE CONSIDERATION. 13
</p>
<p>An agreement, without other consideration than a promise to
</p>
<p>pay, to wait for money then due, is of no vahdity.'
</p>
<p>A promise to pay a note, by a surety, in ignorance of an exten-
</p>
<p>sion whereby he is discharged, is without consideration and not
</p>
<p>enforceable.*
</p>
<p>A promise by a creditor to forgive or relinquish part of his
</p>
<p>debt on the payment of the other part in money, in accordance
</p>
<p>with the existing contract, is without consideration and void.'
</p>
<p>A release by an indorser of a promissory note of a joint maker
</p>
<p>on payment of part only of tlie amount due is, in the absence of
</p>
<p>any other consideration, without consideration and void.*
</p>
<p>A promise by a party to save a witness harmless as to a for-
</p>
<p>feiture for failing, at a former term, to attend, on condition of his
</p>
<p>amending at the next term, is without consideration and void.*
</p>
<p>d. A'alual)le Consideration.  The exchequer chamber in 1875
</p>
<p>defined "consideration" as follows: "A valuable consideration,
</p>
<p>in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest,
</p>
<p>profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance,
</p>
<p>detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by
</p>

</p>
<p>The surrender of other instruments, held as collateral security,

<p>The relinquishment of a defense asserted in good faith is a

<p>subsequently shown by a judicial decision to have been invalid.'

<p>VALUABLE CONSIDERATION. 15
</p>
<p>A performance of the consideration generally renders the con-
</p>
<p>tract binding, and gives a right of action upon it.*
</p>
<p>A promise to pay upon the performance of an act, by which
</p>
<p>the party is injured, becomes binding when the act is performed,
</p>
<p>unless stipulations as to time are not complied with and time is
</p>
<p>of the essence.' Courts " will not ask whether the thing which
</p>
<p>forms the consideration does in fact benefit the promisee or a third
</p>
<p>party, or is of any substantial value to anyone. It is enough that
</p>
<p>something is promised, done, forborne or suffered by the party to
</p>
<p>whom the promise is made as consideration for the promise made
</p>
<p>to him." '
</p>
<p>A consideration expressed in an agreement is sufficient to sup-
</p>
<p>port it in the absence of evidence to prove a lack of consideration.*
</p>
<p>" In general a waiver of any legal right at the request of an-
</p>
<p>other party is a sufficient consideration for a promise."* "Any
</p>
<p>damage, or suspension, or forbearance of a right will be sufficient to
</p>
<p>sustain a promise."* Pollock, in his work on Contracts (p. 166), af-
</p>
<p>ter citing the definition given by the exchequer chamber, already
</p>
<p>quoted, says: " The second branch of this judicial description is
</p>
<p>really the most important one. ' Consideration ' means not so much
</p>
<p>that one party is profiting as that the other abandons some legal right
</p>
<p>in the present, or Hmits his legal freedom of action in the future,
</p>
<p>as an inducement for the promise of the first."
</p>
<p>The withdrawal of a caveat by an heir-at-law is a sufficient con-
</p>
<p>sideration for a promise by devisees under the will as it stands, to
</p>
<p>pay the heir a specific sum.''
</p>
<p>Money expended on the faith of a contract constitutes a valua-
</p>
<p>ble consideration.*

</p>
<p>a sufficient consideration for the promise."
</p>
<p>The surrender of a note given by the defendant's son upon a

</p>
<p>A promise to pay for goods furnished a third party prior to
</p>
<p>their delivery, upon the faith of which a sale and delivery are
</p>
<p>thereafter made," is upon a sufficient consideration."
</p>
<p>A promise conditioned upon the conveyance to the promisor of
</p>
<p>a possible interest which he believes the promisee has, but which
</p>
<p>the latter to his knowledge does not claim, is supported by a suf-
</p>
<p>ficient consideration.'
</p>
<p>Extension of time of payment, under a conditional sale of
</p>
<p>engines, and the permitted use of the engines during such time by
</p>
<p>the vendee, is a sufficient consideration for note and mortgage by

<p>him."
</p>
<p>The maker's assent to the proposed compromise of his claim

</p>
<p>Any benefit to defendant or detriment, however sliglit, to
</p>
<p>plaintiff is a sufficient consideration.'
</p>
<p>A consideration to support a promise need not inure to the
</p>
<p>personal benefit of the promisor; it is sufficient if it consists in a
</p>
<p>detriment to the person to whom the promise is made.'
</p>
<p>Xor is it at all essential that a person to whom the considera-
</p>
<p>tion of a promise moves should be benefited provided the person
</p>
<p>from whom it moves Ls in even a legal sense injured; and the in-
</p>
<p>jury may consist of a release or a compromise of a disputed elaim
</p>
<p>or forbearance to exercise a legal right, the alteration in position
</p>
<p>of the parties being regarded as a detriment forming a considera-
</p>
<p>tion independent of the actual value of the right forborne.'
</p>
<p>Damage to the promisee as a matter of law constitutes as good
</p>
<p>a consideration to support a contract as benefit to the promisor.*
</p>
<p>A very slight advantage to one party, or what he considers
</p>
<p>such, constitutes a sufficient consideration to support a contract,
</p>
<p>in the absence of fraud or mistake.*
</p>
<p>A valuable consideration, however small, if given or stipulated
</p>
<p>for in good faith, is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient to support
</p>

<p>settle on a lot of land of A, he would convey it to him, and B

<p>e. Expectation of Results, not a Consideration.  But while
</p>
<p>the hope or strong probability of realized results often leads to
</p>
<p>the execution of a contract, it must be remembered that there is
</p>
<p>a clear distinction sometimes between the motive that may induce
</p>
<p>to entering into the contract and the consideration of the contract.
</p>
<p>Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both
</p>
<p>parties. It is the price voluntarily paid for the promisor's under-
</p>
<p>taking. Tholigh the expectation has led to the formation of the
</p>
<p>contract, neither the expectation nor the result is "the cause or
</p>
<p>meritorious occasion requiring a mutual recompense in fact or in
</p>
<p>law." Dyer, 306, h. Thus a creditor may do a favor to his
</p>
<p>debtor, or may enter into a new and independent contract with
</p>
<p>him, induced by which, the debtor may assent to giving a note
</p>
<p>for the previous existing indebtedness. "Without the favor or the
</p>
<p>new contract, thei'e is in such a case a full consideration for the
</p>
<p>note, and the parties may not have contemplated that the favor or
</p>
<p>the new contract was to be paid for. To regard them as entering
</p>
<p>into the consideration of the note, would be to make a contract
</p>
<p>for the parties to which their minds never assented.*

</p>
<p> A mere voluntary promise, without consideration of any kind,
</p>
<p>either legal or equitable, is not enforceable.'
</p>
<p>A promise by a husband to his wife on her death-bed that their
</p>
<p>son should have certain property, does not constitute a valuable
</p>
<p>consideration for a conveyance by him to the son.^
</p>
<p>There must be a consideration to sustain an agreement by a
</p>
<p>creditor to allow a new trial to a defeated debtor, in a suit on the
</p>
<p>debt.^"
</p>
<p>Voluntary service or labor done without the privity or consent
</p>
<p>of the defendant, however beneficial to him, as a voluntary ser-
</p>
<p>vice in saving his property from destruction by fire, will not sup-
</p>
<p>port a promise; * for an act done for the benefit of another, with-
</p>
<p>out his request, is to be deemed a voluntary act, for wliich no action
</p>
<p>can be sustained. But, it has been held, that if, after knowing of
</p>
<p>the service the person benefited promises to pay for it, an action
</p>
<p>may under certain circumstances be sustained on the promise.*
</p>
<p>But generally, if there be no request, nor promise to pay for ser-
</p>
<p>vice, a subsequent promise to make compensation therefor is void.*
</p>
<p>A promise to pay a niece for services in one's family, of which
</p>
<p>she was a member, made after she had married and left the fam-
</p>
<p>ily, is void for want of consideration.' But it is equally true that
</p>
<p>a past act or service rendered pursuant to a previous request of
</p>
<p>the promisor is suflicient to sustain an action on a subsequent
</p>
<p>promise.*
</p>
<p>There must be the concurrence of the minds of all parties in
</p>
<p>reference to the thing to be done, as the essence of a contract is

<p>the mutual agreement.'

<p>g. Wager Policies on Lite.  The revelations made in the
</p>
<p>course of an action against an insurance company at the 1891, Maii-
</p>
<p>cliester, England, assizes, have forced into the public notice as
</p>
<p>hideous a traffic in human life as ever disgraced a civilized coun-
</p>
<p>try. Gambling in lives has in many Lancashire towns, but chiefly
</p>
<p>in Blackburn, long been a lucrative occupation. The insurance
</p>
<p>companies are hoodwinked and defrauded, and the miserable vic-
</p>
<p>tims of the conspiracy are, by means not actually criminal, shuf-
</p>
<p>fled out of life. Husbands insure their wives, wives their hus-
</p>
<p>bands, children their parents.
</p>
<p>Auvone who is believed to be "within measurable distance" of
</p>
<p>the grave is fair game for the speculator. He scans his neighbor
</p>
<p>as a valuer scans a household of furniture. Let but the symptoms
</p>
<p>of consumption or any other fatal disease appear and he makes
</p>
<p>insinuating advances to secure a policy on the doomed one's life.
</p>
<p>Of course his victims are, as a rule, selected from the very dregs
</p>
<p>of humanity  the drunken, diseased and feeble  who for the
</p>
<p>sake of prospective drinks readily sign the "bit o' paper," and
</p>
<p>thenceforward have their path to the grave smoothed and facili-
</p>
<p>tated by 'the creatures who fatten upon them.
</p>
<p>The case heard at the Manchester assizes differs in no essential
</p>
<p>respect from a hundred others. The victim in that case was a
</p>
<p>wretched old hostler or hanger-on of a public house. He had not
</p>
<p>a copper in the world to call his own, but he had something much
</p>
<p>more valuable to others; he had unequivocal symptoms of speedy
</p>
<p>disease. Forthwith he was honored with the anxious attention of

<p>the harpies. Glowing reports were made to the insurance com-

<p>WAGER POLICIES ON LIFE. ^"^
</p>
<p> id the poor old fellow, trembling on the brink of eternity, bore
</p>
<p>the burden of twenty policies, with a total value of 1,700. Hap-
</p>
<p>pily, one of the insurance companies had the courage to fight the
</p>
<p>conspiracy bv disputing the claim, and was victorious. Indeed,
</p>
<p>the barrister engaged for the plaintiff, when he saw the sort of
</p>
<p><;ase he was put up to champion, honorably threw up his brief.
</p>
<p>This case is but a type of hundreds of others which have made
</p>
<p>life insurance a term of evil import in the north of England. In
</p>
<p>Blackburn a common loiterer about the market place is insured in
</p>
<p>various companies for nearly 9,000. He is aware of the fact
</p>
<p>that death will materially increase his commercial value, but so
</p>
<p>long as his income of a few shillings is supplemented by fees for
</p>
<p>sicrning insurance papers "he does not care how long the thing
</p>
<p>o-oes oil." The poor wretch is respectably connected and once
</p>
<p>held a decent position in society, but a life of dissipation has
</p>
<p>broucrht him into the web of the insurance speculator, whence he
</p>
<p>M-ill never escape save in a coffin. In another case a man who
</p>
<p>spends a large portion of his time in the work-house is insured for
</p>
<p>3,880. and in a third a hawker of bags of coal, who, living, is
</p>
<p>worth hardly the clothes upon his back, Avill as a corpse be valued
</p>
<p>M 1.900. " '
</p>
<p>Many of the miserable beings thus traded upon are totally
</p>
<p>unconscious of the enormous sums which are involved when they
</p>
<p>"sign a bit of paper" for a "friend" and a drink. In one
</p>
<p>instance a poor, sickly weaver, who is insured in one office alone
</p>
<p>for 1,000, when asked whether he knew the amount of his insur-
</p>
<p>ance, replied, "Well, nobbut a few pounds; twenty or thirty, hap-
</p>
<p>pen." He admitted that he had never paid the premiums and
</p>
<p>that he did not know the person who had acted as referee. Fur-
</p>
<p>thur investigation showed that the policy had been effected by an
</p>
<p>intermediary, who, in consideration of a portion of the commission,
</p>
<p>had served to conceal the identity of the insurer.

<p>brandj with which their patrons indulge them, with the view of
</p>
<p>assisting them more speedily to a better world, is often ineffectual.
</p>
<p>Nay, it seems only to increase the vitality of the remaining leg.
</p>
<p>One typical case will suffice as an instance.
</p>
<p>A certain feeble and apparently moribund old man has been the-
</p>
<p>subject of very particular attention from the speculating frater-
</p>
<p>nity, who have insured him wholesale. His signature to policies
</p>
<p>has been eagerly sought after and he has reveled in unlimited su^)-
</p>
<p>plies of spirits for years. lie has, however, proved himself an
</p>
<p>uncommonly tough morsel for his patrons. Racked by cough,
</p>
<p>afflicted hy rheumatism, he yet " lags superfluous on the stage,"
</p>
<p>and not a few policies upon his life have been allowed to lapse.
</p>
<p>One speculator alone has paid more than 40 above what he will
</p>
<p>receive when the hardy old man's final adsum is uttered.
</p>
<p>Doubtless the wonder will be that these conspiracies against the
</p>
<p>insurance companies are possible. The system, however, is very
</p>
<p>simple. The speculators are in league with the more unscrupu-
</p>
<p>lous insurance agents, from whom they receive a portion of the
</p>
<p>commission the companies allow on new policies. They act as the
</p>
<p>agents' touts^ and after taking an inventory of the victim's pros-
</p>
<p>pects of a reasonable early death, induce him or her to be insured.
</p>
<p>This done, the rest is easy, for ^vith the agent co-operating with
</p>
<p>him the speculator has little difficulty in hoodwinking the company
</p>
<p>and palming upon it a life which, were the true facts made
</p>
<p>known, would be accepted on no conditions whatever. It is only
</p>
<p>fair to say that the majority of the agents are honorable men, but
</p>
<p>the proportion of unscrupulous agents who lend themselves to the
</p>
<p>ghoulish practices of the speculators is alarmingly large. The
</p>
<p>insurance companies chiefly concerned are at last becoming alive
</p>
<p>to the enormity of the conspiracies against them, and now that one
</p>
<p>of them has had the courage to expose the system and has scored
</p>
<p>an easy triumph, drastic measures may be adopted to stop the
</p>
<p>accursed traffic in human life.

<p>WAGER POLICIES ON LIFE. 25
</p>
<p>Where the assured had no insurable interest in the life of the cestui
</p>
<p>qtoe vie, the contract of insurance was simply a washer; it was not
</p>
<p>founded upon any just or lawful consideration; it was a mere
</p>
<p>gambling speculation. The assured was not to be indemnified
</p>
<p>against loss, injury or disadvantage in any respect growing out of
</p>
<p>the life he insured; the insurance was not intended to serve any
</p>
<p>legitimate business purpose or end; it was purely a matter of spec-
</p>
<p>ulation, founded upon nothing but hazard. Such contracts and
</p>
<p>speculations are wholly unnecessary. They cannot serve or pro-
</p>
<p>mote any useful and wholesome purposes of individuals, society or
</p>
<p>government. They do not stimulate, promote or encourage indus-
</p>
<p>try, enterprise, legitimate business, sound morality or increase the
</p>
<p>wealth of the people, or the strength and power of the State. On
</p>
<p>the contrary, their nature and uniform experience go to show that
</p>
<p>they represent nothing substantial or valuable, or of practical
</p>
<p>advantage to persons or communities. They strongly tend to de-
</p>
<p>moralize society, and embarrass industries and general business.
</p>
<p>In their very nature they stimulate, aiford incentives to and
</p>
<p>encourage those who become parties to them, to resort to sinister,
</p>
<p>oftentimes criminal, means to turn or end the hazard in their
</p>
<p>favor, and thus gain unjust and dishonest advantage. They
</p>
<p>encourage men to engage in the business of speculation in hazards,
</p>
<p>not necessary or useful in the general purposes and businesses of
</p>
<p>life, but which is positively and seriously injurious to them. Such
</p>
<p>contracts and speculations contravene the justice and policy of the
</p>
<p>law,  they are coni/ra honos mores, and are therefore void. It is
</p>
<p>well settled, by a multitude of uniform decisions, that all con-
</p>
<p>tracts against the policy of the law, and such as contravene sound
</p>
<p>morality, are on such account void.'

</p>
<p>nor is any reason stated wliy it was sucli wa^er. If the court
</p>
<p>intended that the case should have general application to wagers
</p>
<p>in insurance, embracing cases like the present one, it is not sus-
</p>
<p>tained by the greater weight of reason, or the greater weight of

<p>authority, certainly at the present day.'
</p>
<p>A policy taken upon the life of another for speculative pur-
</p>
<p>poses is regarded as nothing more than a wager."
</p>
<p>The insurable interest must be of a substantial character, and
</p>
<p>such as, under all the circumstances, to take from the transaction
</p>
<p>all suspicion of wagering.' But an insurable interest must be ac-
</p>
<p>tual and such as will reasonably justify a well grounded expecta-
</p>
<p>tion of advantage, dei^endent upon the life of the insured.'
</p>
<p>The law seems to be well settled that it is virholly unnecessary to
</p>
<p>prove an insurable interest in the life of the assured, at the ma-
</p>
<p>turity of the policy, if it was valid at its inception; and in the ab-
</p>
<p>sence of express stipulation to the contrary, the sum expressed on
</p>
<p>the face of the policy is the measure of recovery.^
</p>
<p>"Where a third party, without any insurable interest in the life
</p>
<p>of another, procures a policy of insurance on the life of such per-
</p>
<p>son, either by having a policy issued directly to himself, or by
</p>
<p>having the person whose life is insured take out a policy to him-
</p>
<p>self and then assign it, the transaction is a mere speculation on
</p>
<p>the life of another, and, as such, contrary to public policy and

</p>
<p>A life insurance policy for $3,000 as security for a $100 debt
</p>
<p>is a wager.*

<p>sum of $3,000, $2,000 for his own benefit and $1,000 for the ben-

</p>
<p>a wagering policy."
</p>
<p>Where a creditor had insured his debtor's life on two several

<p>'2S LIMITATIONS UPON THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>The sum insured must not be grossly disproportionate to the
</p>
<p>interest the holder of the policy has in the life insured, without
</p>
<p>leaving the transaction open to the imputation of being a specu-
</p>
<p>lation or wager upon the hazard of a life.'
</p>
<p>The essential point is that the transaction be bona fide, and not
</p>
<p>a device to evade the law.'
</p>
<p>In Burhage v. Whulley, 12 L. R. A. 409, 108 N. C. ?>5T, as
</p>
<p>expressly alleged, the permission was granted to the testator of
</p>
<p>the defendant by the former husband of the feme plaintiff, Ham-
</p>
<p>mond, to insure the lattei-'s life. If such permission, in any case
</p>
<p>or connection, could be a valuable privilege or advantage, in this
</p>
<p>ease it was granted with the view and for the purpose of enabling
</p>
<p>and helping Windley to make an unlawful contract  a wager 
</p>
<p>on the life of Ilanmiond. Thus the latter became connected with
</p>
<p>and intended to share in the wagering transaction. The promise
</p>
<p>to pay $500 to the feme plaintiff was expressly based upon and
</p>
<p>grew out of it; it was, as to Hammond and his wife, part of it.
</p>
<p>It partook of the wager,  the vicious nature of the contract of
</p>
<p>insurance. Such consideration was therefore void. Hence the
</p>
<p>promise founded upon it was without legal sanction, and of no
</p>
<p>binding effect, in contemplation of laAv. Ex terpi causa non
</p>
<p>oritur actio ^
</p>
<p>If, in good faith, the purpose liad been to insure the life of
</p>
<p>Hammond for the benefit of his wife, the case, as to her, might
</p>
<p>be very different. But this was not the purpose, or any part of
</p>
<p>it. The insurance M^as for the benefit of Windley; the policies
</p>
<p>were granted to and made payable to him; he promised to pay
</p>
<p>the small sum mentioned to the feme plaintiff for permission to
</p>
<p>insure the life.

<p>WAGER POLICIES ON LIFE. 29
</p>
<p>Relnochl,  Pa. , 13 L. R. A. 433, decided that the ques-
</p>
<p>tion as to the validity of a policy depending on the excess of
</p>
<p>the amount of insurance over the debt, the facts being admitted,
</p>
<p>is a question of law. And a rule is also stated for determining
</p>
<p>the question of what is an unreasonable excess. In that case the
</p>
<p>defendants were doing a tirm business at Lebanon, Pa., and hold a
</p>
<p>judgment against one Andrew Bleistine, in the Court of Common
</p>
<p>Pleas of Lebanon County, which, with interest and costs amouuted
</p>
<p>to $110.02. The judgment was sufficiently secured on real estate,
</p>
<p>and the defendants were not pressing their debtor for the money.
</p>
<p>He was being pressed by other creditors who held subsequent liens
</p>
<p>on his property. It was necessary to quiet them for Bleistine to
</p>
<p>pay off the judgment held by the defendants, or get rid of it in
</p>
<p>some manner. Not having the money he applied to the defend-
</p>
<p>ants to satisfy it, and take a policy on his life instead. The evi-
</p>
<p>dence is uncontradicted that the defendants were averse to this,
</p>
<p>and for a time declined, but linally yielded to Bleistine's entreaties,
</p>
<p>and his wife's tears, to save their home. The evidence shows
</p>
<p>that Bleistine oifered them an insurance of $3,000, or $5,000, or
</p>
<p>$10,000, or any amount they wanted. The negotiation resulted
</p>
<p>in the defendants taking a policy of $3,000 on the life of Bleistine
</p>
<p>in the U. B. Mutual Aid Society. The policy was issued in the
</p>
<p>name of Bleistine as beneticiary and afterwards assigned by him
</p>
<p>to the defendants, who paid the entrance fee and all subsequent
</p>
<p>assessments. The assignment was absolute and not as collateral
</p>
<p>security, and the judgment referred to was satisfied of record.
</p>
<p>After Bleistine's death the insurance money was paid by the com-
</p>
<p>pany to the defendants. Subsequently this suit was brought by
</p>
<p>the executor of Bleistine to recover from them the amount
</p>
<p>received over the debt and interest, and premiums paid, the
</p>
<p>plaintiff alleging that the amount of insurance was so dispropor-
</p>
<p>tioned to the debt as to make it a gambling transaction within
</p>
<p>the doctrine of Gilbert v. Moose, 104 Pa. 74, and the cases follow-
</p>
<p>ing it.

</p>
<p>The court in deciding the case say that we may safely assume
</p>
<p>that the debt due by Bleistine to the defendants was bona fide;
</p>
<p>that so far from the latter having procured the former to insure
</p>
<p>his life for their benefit for speculative purposes, they entered
</p>
<p>30 LIMITATIONS UPON THE KIGIIT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>into it with reluctance at the earnest request of Bleistino and liis
</p>
<p>wife, to relieve them from financial emharrassment and to save
</p>
<p>their home. This, it is lield, takes out of the case the controHintr
</p>
<p>element wliich existed in Gilbert v, Moose^ and that line of cases.
</p>
<p>Yet if the defendants, even for an honest purpose, have trans-
</p>
<p>gressed the law, and made this a gambling transaction, they must
</p>
<p>suffer the j^enalty for such violation.
</p>
<p>The first and second assignments of error are said to present the
</p>
<p>main question in the case. Upon the trial below the defendants
</p>
<p>proved, under exception, the life expectancy of Bleistine, and the
</p>
<p>amount of assessments on this policy had he lived out his full life
</p>
<p>expectancy. It appears from this evidence that the insured was
</p>
<p>forty-two years of age, and that his expectation of life, according
</p>
<p>to the Carlisle Tables, was twenty-six years; that had he lived that
</p>
<p>length of time the interest on the judgment, with the annual dues
</p>
<p>and assessments and interest thereon, would have amounted to
</p>
<p>$4,336.31, being $1,336.31 in excess of the amount of the policy.
</p>
<p>This evidence was not contradicted. Its admission forms the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of the first assignment.
</p>
<p>In the second assignment of error complaint is made that the
</p>
<p>judge erred in his answer to the plaintiff's sixth point. The point
</p>
<p>is as follows: "The amonnt allowed and paid as the consideration
</p>
<p>of the transfer of the insurance, to wit, the sum of $99.51, with
</p>
<p>interest thereon from December 7, 1875, to April 2, 1877, and the
</p>
<p>costs were grossly inadequate; and the disproportion between that
</p>
<p>amount and the amount of the insurance  $3,(J00  is so great as
</p>
<p>to require the court to say, as matter of law, that the transaction
</p>
<p>was a wager, and that in this action Eeinoehl <fe Menily have no
</p>
<p>right to retain more of the insurance money received by them
</p>
<p>than the amount of their satisfied judgment w^ith interest and
</p>
<p>costs, and the premiums and assessments paid by them, with inter-
</p>
<p>est thereon, and therefore the verdict of the jury must be in favor
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff for the amount received by the defendants, with
</p>
<p>interest from the date of its receipt, less the amount of the judg-

</p>
<p>ment, interest and costs, and assessments and premiums paid with
</p>
<p>interest." This point was refused.
</p>
<p>In examining this ruling it is said that whether the question of
</p>
<p>excess of insurance is to be disposed of by the court as a matter
</p>
<p>WAGER POLICIES ON LIFE. 31
</p>
<p>of law, or by the jury as a question of fact, it is essential that
</p>
<p>there should be a fixed rule. The importance of this was recog-
</p>
<p>nized by the judge in delivering the opinion of the court in
</p>
<p>Grant v. Kline, 115 Pa. 618, 7 Cent. Rep. 626, where he said:
</p>
<p>"" Speaking for myself, it may be that a policy taken out by a
</p>
<p>creditor on the life of his debtor ought to be limited to the amount
</p>
<p>of the debt with interest, and the amount of premiums with inter-
</p>
<p>est thereon, during the expectancy of life, as shown by the Car-
</p>
<p>lisle Tables. This view, however, has never been adopted by this
</p>
<p>court in any adjudicated case, nor do we feel compelled to define
</p>
<p>the disproportion now in view of the particular facts of the case
</p>
<p>in hand." In the subsequent case of Coojier v. Shaeffer (Pa.) 9'
</p>
<p>Cent. liep. 601, Sterrett, J., after quoting the above, remarked:
</p>
<p>" This appears to be a just and practicable rule."  No such rule
</p>
<p>was established, however, in Cooper v. Shaeffer. In that case
</p>
<p>there was an insurance of $8,000 to cover a debt of $100, and the
</p>
<p>court said, through Mr. Justice Sterrett: "In view of the undis-
</p>
<p>puted facts, the learned judge of the common pleas held that the
</p>
<p>disproportion between the insurance of $3,000 and the debt of
</p>
<p>$100 was so great as to require him to say, as matter of law, that
</p>
<p>the transaction was a wager, and that the assignors of the policy
</p>
<p>had no right to retain more of the insurance money recovered by
</p>
<p>them than the amount of the debt, plus the premiums paid and
</p>
<p>interest thereon. In this he was clearly right. The disproj^or-
</p>
<p>tion is so great as to make the insurance a palpable wager, and no
</p>
<p>court should hesitate to declare it so as matter of law."
</p>
<p>It seems clear that in a proper case where the facts are not dis-
</p>
<p>puted, it is the duty of the court to pronounce upon the character
</p>
<p>of the policy. Thus in Grant v. Kline^ supra,it was said: "To
</p>
<p>take out a policy of $5,000 to secure a debt of $5 would be such
</p>
<p>a palpable wager that no court would hesitate to declare it so as
</p>
<p>matter of law." It is true this remark was made by way of illus-
</p>
<p>tration, and it is only referred to for that purpose now. Cooper
</p>
<p>v. Shaeffer decided nothing but that particular litigation. It laid

</p>
<p>down no rule for the future beyond its owm particular facts, viz:
</p>
<p>That an insurance of $3,000 for a debt of $100, unexplained, was
</p>
<p>a gambling policy. It may be asked why it does not rule a case
</p>
<p>where the amount of insurance was the same and a difference of
</p>
<p>'32 LIMITATIONS UPON THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>a few dollars only in the amount of the debt? The answer is not
</p>
<p>difficult. Cooper v. Shaeffer was decided upon the single ground
</p>
<p>of the disproportion between the insurance and the debt. There
</p>
<p>were no facts in evidence by which this disproportion could be
</p>
<p>explained, or shown to be justifiable. This appears by the report
</p>
<p>of the case as well as from the opinion of Judge Simonton, who
</p>
<p>tried that, as well as this case below. In refusing a new trial in
</p>
<p>the case in hand, that learned and able judge said in reference to
</p>
<p>Cooper V. Shaeffer: "Even the age of tlie insured was not dwelt
</p>
<p>upon as an element of the problem, and tliere was not a word of
</p>
<p>evidence as to the expectancy of life or the probable amoimt of
</p>
<p>annual payments to be made. Here, however, these important
</p>
<p>matters were urged as a principal ground of defense and required
</p>
<p>consideration. In our opinion they necessarily carried the case to
</p>
<p>the jury, and abundantly justified the verdict. The defendants
</p>
<p>insured a healthy man of forty-two years in the sum of $3,000 to
</p>
<p>protect a debt of $100. If he had merely lived out his expec-
</p>
<p>tancy and no longer, they would have been obliged to pay for
</p>
<p>assessments and annual dues $2,436.32, to which, if interest be
</p>
<p>added, the amount of their investment would have been $4,336.31.
</p>
<p>In return they would have received $3,000, thus suffering a con-
</p>
<p>siderable loss. Surely to call such a transaction speculation is to
</p>
<p>misuse the word. That it happened to be profitable, because the
</p>
<p>insured died within a few years, is manifestly not to the point."
</p>
<p>This extract emphasizes the distinction between Cooper v. Shaef-
</p>
<p>fer and the case of Ulrich v. Reinoehl.
</p>
<p>The law very properly lays a mailed hand upon speculative life
</p>
<p>insurance. Of all the forjns of gambling, it is one of the most
</p>
<p>objectionable. The records of our courts show that it sometimes
</p>
<p>leads to murder. The holder of a policy upon a life in which he
</p>
<p>has no interest either of a social or pecuniary nature has a strong
</p>
<p>interest in the death of the assured. This interest grows and
</p>
<p>strengthens with each payment of premium. He has made a bid
</p>
<p>upon the life of another person. A man who will engage in such

</p>
<p>a transaction cannot safely be regarded as a saint. He sees with
</p>
<p>growing impatience that life prolonged from year to year, and his
</p>
<p>money slipping away in premiums. A man thus situated soon
</p>
<p>becomes familiar with the thought of the death of the person who
</p>
<p>WAGEB POLICIES ON LIFE. 33
</p>
<p>stands between him and wliat, in bis morbid fancy, lie may regard
</p>
<p>as his rights. That crime follows in some instances is a fact of
</p>
<p>which conrts have judicial knowledge.
</p>
<p>All life insurance is in one sense speculative, yet within proper
</p>
<p>restrictions it has been found to be highly beneficent and not in
</p>
<p>conflict with public policy. It enables a man in the days of his
</p>
<p>early struggles to provide for his family in case of his death. It
</p>
<p>renders it possible for a business man to borrow the capital needed
</p>
<p>for success. It furnishes the means and the only means by which
</p>
<p>a creditor may sometmies secure a doubtful claim. Yet in all
</p>
<p>these cases there is the element of speculation, for if the assured
</p>
<p>dies shortly after the policy is issued, the beneficiary, whether he
</p>
<p>be a blood relation or a creditor, gets a sum of money greatly dis-
</p>
<p>proportioned to the amount paid. But in these cases the law does
</p>
<p>not regard tlie speculative element as one of danger. It is true
</p>
<p>that a son who takes out a policy on the life of his father, or a
</p>
<p>creditor upon the life of his debtor, may have an interest in the
</p>
<p>death of the assured, and resort to crime to procure it, but expe-
</p>
<p>rience shows that such instances are extremely rare, and the
</p>
<p>temptation no greater than in thousands of other instances in
</p>
<p>which one person may be benefited pecuniarily by the death of
</p>
<p>another. But a policy taken out by one who has no interest either
</p>
<p>as a creditor or a relative in the life of the assured, is always a
</p>
<p>dang-er sio-nal.
</p>
<p>It is settled law that a creditor has an insurable interest in the
</p>
<p>life of his debtor, but up to this time there is no decision as to the
</p>
<p>limit of this right. Each case has been decided upon its own
</p>
<p>facts. In Cooper v. Shaeffer, as before observed, it was said the
</p>
<p>insurance was too large; in Grant v. Kline, on the other hand, the
</p>
<p>amount of insurance was held not disproportioned to the debt.
</p>
<p>But it is necessary to lay down some fixed rule by which such
</p>
<p>cases can be disposed of in the' future, otherwise the rulings of
</p>
<p>the courts and the verdicts of juries upon such questions will be
</p>
<p>arbitrary, and where there is nothing in a case but the amount of

</p>
<p>lawfully take out a policy thereon, the court in Ulrich v. Rei-
</p>
<p>noehl, 13 L. R. A. 433, declares it follows logically that he may
</p>
<p>take out the policy in such a sum as may reasonably secure the
</p>
<p>debt. It needs no argument to show that if my debtor owes me
</p>
<p>$1,000 a policy for $1,000 would be inadequate, for if my debtor
</p>
<p>dies within twenty-four hours after the policy is taken out, I am
</p>
<p>a loser by the amount of the premium paid, and it would be but
</p>
<p>a few years before the interest on tlie debt and the premiums
</p>
<p>would exceed the debt. Every future payment then would be a
</p>
<p>loss, with the only alternative of adding to this loss year by year,
</p>
<p>or abandoning the policy altogether, and sinking the whole amount

<p>paid. It. seems clear upon reason that the creditor may take out a
</p>
<p>policy in excess of his debt. But to what excess ? The answer to
</p>
<p>this question obviously depends upon circumstances. An import-
</p>
<p>ant element in the consideration of this question is the age of the
</p>
<p>assured. The difference between a policy on the life of a man of
</p>
<p>twenty-five years of age and one of seventy-five is clear to the dull-
</p>
<p>est understanding. In the above case the assured was only forty-two
</p>
<p>years of age; and his expectancy of life was twenty-six years. The
</p>
<p>chances were greatly in favor of his living out his expectancy. The
</p>
<p>Carlisle Tables were prepared with care by competent experts, and
</p>
<p>are the result of actual experience. The court, therefore, felt
</p>
<p>justified in saying that the chances were in favor of the assured
</p>
<p>living out his expectancy, in which case there would be the loss
</p>
<p>of interest on the debt for twenty-six years added to the dues and
</p>
<p>assessments, with interest thereon, for the same period. The evi-
</p>
<p>dence shows that in such event the defendants would have been
</p>
<p>losers by a considerable sum. In fact it is inferred from the tables
</p>
<p>furnished that after about seventeen years the defendants would
</p>
<p>have carried this policy at a loss. The defendants assumed this
</p>
<p>risk when they took out the policy. They also had the chance of
</p>
<p>the assured not living out his expectancy. This is a risk which an
</p>
<p>insurance company assumes upon every policy which it issues. In
</p>
<p>a particular instance the assured may live many years beyond his

</p>
<p>expectancy, which is a large gain to the company. But this gain
</p>
<p>is equalized by the loss in instances where the assured dies before
</p>
<p>the expiration of his expectancy, so that in the vast volume of
</p>
<p>business of such corporations the average result is reasonably uni-
</p>
<p>WAGER POLICIES ON LIFE. 35
</p>
<p>form. But the holder of a single policy can have no average re-
</p>
<p>sult. He takes the risk with the chances fairly balanced. Had
</p>
<p>lie taken out one hundred policies on the lives of as many
</p>
<p>debtors, it is more than probable that some of them would have
</p>
<p>largely exceeded their expectation, while others would not have
</p>
<p>reached it. In such case there would not have been material gain
</p>
<p>or loss.
</p>
<p>If the assured should live out his expectancy of life no ques-
</p>
<p>tion could probably arise as to the right of the holder to retain
</p>
<p>the whole of the money. It could not then be successfully assailed
</p>
<p>as a gambling transaction. But the character of the contract can-
</p>
<p>not depend upon results, or the accident of death. If not lawful
</p>
<p>in its inception it could never become so.
</p>
<p>In order to ascertain whether an insurance is disproportioned to
</p>
<p>the debt, regard must be had to the age of the assured, his expec-
</p>
<p>tation of life and the cost of carrying the insurance with interest
</p>
<p>thereon, as well as upon the amount of the debt. The evidence
</p>
<p>which forms the subject of the first assignment, the court say, was
</p>
<p>not only proper, but essential, to an intelligent understanding of
</p>
<p>the case. It is just what was lacking in Grant v. Kline, and was
</p>
<p>one of the reasons why the court avoided deciding the broad ques-
</p>
<p>tion in that case. But anyone who reads that opinion between the
</p>
<p>lines can see that the judicial mind must have been influenced to
</p>
<p>some extent by the suggestion in reference to the Carlisle Tables.
</p>
<p>The rule announced in TJlricli v. Reinoehl, supra, it is admitted
</p>
<p>may not be the best, but the court has not been able to find a bet-
</p>
<p>ter, after a most careful and anxious consideration of the question.
</p>
<p>That it will not produce exact justice in all cases is possible.
</p>
<p>There will always be cases of individual hardship in the applica-
</p>
<p>tion of all general rules. Ko general rule can be made to fit each
</p>
<p>particular case, otherwise it would cease to be a rule. Attention
</p>
<p>was especially called to this difficulty by the following extract from
</p>
<p>the opinion of the learned judge below in refusing a new trial:
</p>

<p>Grant v. Kline, 115 Pa. 625, 7 Cent. Kep. 626, and Cooper v. Shaef-
</p>
<p>fer (Pa.) 9 Cent. Rep. 601, as the proper rule to determine for what
</p>
<p>sum a creditor's policy should be taken out, ought to be somewhat
</p>
<p>expanded before it is positively adopted. As now stated, it would

<p>30 LIMITATIONS UPON THE RIGHT TO CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>not provide for a case like this, where the poHcy is taken out in a
</p>
<p>company which levies annual (monthly ?) assessments, and where
</p>
<p>therefore allowance must be made in the creditor's forecast for
</p>
<p>possible fluctuations; neither would it now provide for the not in-
</p>
<p>frequent contingency of the insured outliving his expectancy.
</p>
<p>Under the present form of the indicated rule, the creditor must
</p>
<p>always lose if the debtor hves beyond his expectancy; and it can-
</p>
<p>not be accurately applied to assessment insurance, because in this
</p>
<p>variety of the business the annual payments are not a previously
</p>
<p>known and certain sum."
</p>
<p>But the court has no difficulty in disposing of the objection that
</p>
<p>the rule does not provide for the case of the assured hving beyond
</p>
<p>his expectancy and thus entaihng a loss upon the creditor. If we
</p>
<p>go beyond the expectency^ where are we to stop ? A man may live
</p>
<p>to the age of a hundred, and such a length of days is of frequent
</p>
<p>occurrence. To sanction a policy covering such a period, and yet
</p>
<p>to allow the holder to recover the full amount in case of death
</p>
<p>within a year would be a retrograde step in the decisions. Under
</p>
<p>such a system the creditor would be absolutely secure, with the
</p>
<p>possibility of an enormous gain in case of an early death. Whereas
</p>
<p>at present, the risk of a debtor's exceeding his expectancy is equal-
</p>
<p>ized by the possibility of his death within it, and in a given num-
</p>
<p>ber of cases the result produces uniformity. The want of uni-
</p>
<p>formity is not the fault of the rule, but of its apphcation to a single
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>There is more difficulty, the court admits, in the other objection.
</p>
<p>The policy in question, however, it is said, was taken out in a mu-
</p>
<p>tual company, where assessments are made from time to time, and
</p>
<p>there appears to have been no difficulty upon the trial below in
</p>
<p>ascertaining with sufficient accuracy the amount of assessments
</p>
<p>which the defendants would have been called upon to pay had the
</p>
<p>assured lived out his expectancy. The precise amount of such
</p>
<p>assessments cannot of course be estimated with the same accuracy
</p>
<p>as in the case of a company in which the annual premium is a fixed

</p>
<p>sum. But the assessments even in a mutual company can be ap-
</p>
<p>proximated by the experience of other similar companies with suf-
</p>
<p>ficient accuracy to base an insurance upon it. And where a policy
</p>
<p>has been taken out in good faith by a creditor, the law does not
</p>
<p>WAGER POLICIES ON LIFE. 37
</p>
<p>exact impossibilities. A slight mistake, one waj or the other, ow-
</p>
<p>ing to the condition of the company's business, by which assessments
</p>
<p>are increased or diminished, would not necessarily vitiate a policy.
</p>
<p>The cost of life insurance by whatever system adopted, it is be-
</p>
<p>lieved, does not vary so greatly as to prevent a reasonal^le approxi-
</p>
<p>mation thereof.
</p>
<p>It may be that few men would take out a hfe policy to secure a
</p>
<p>debt of $100, where there is an expectancy of life for twenty-six
</p>
<p>years, and pay an annual assessment or premium in excess of the
</p>
<p>whole amount of the debt. But courts do not pass upon the wis-
</p>
<p>dom of contracts. They only consider their legahty and care must
</p>
<p>be taken in the enforcement of an admittedly sound rule of policy
</p>
<p>not to impinge upon the right of the citizen to contract. In TJl-
</p>
<p>rich V. Reinoehl, sujyra, the contract was lawful, and the defend-
</p>
<p>ants appear to have entered in not so much for their own benefit as
</p>
<p>for the accommodation of the assured. The court is not to meas-
</p>
<p>ure its legality by its results but by its surroundings at the time it
</p>
<p>was made.
</p>
<p>In conclusion the opinion is expressed that a creditor may law-
</p>
<p>fully take out a policy on the life of his debtor in an amount to
</p>
<p>cover the debt with interest, and the cost of such insurance with
</p>
<p>interest thereon during the period of the expectancy of hfe of the
</p>
<p>assured, according to the Carlisle Tables.
</p>
<p>In some states a creditor holding a poHcy on the life of his
</p>
<p>debtor as security for his debt is held a trustee to the extent of the
</p>
<p>proceeds above the debt and expenses, and may be called on to
</p>
<p>account therefor by the personal representatives of the debtor.'
</p>
<p>A creditor who takes an assignment of a hfe policy as security
</p>
<p>for a loan can hold the proceeds of that policy only to the extent
</p>
<p>of the sums actually advanced by him.*
</p>
<p>In other states in the absence of evidence that the policy was
</p>
<p>held in trust for the debtor, where the rights of the parties appear
</p>
<p>upon the face of the policy, the presumption is against such trust.'

</p>
<p>and if the debt is paid the insurance is at an end. But it is now
</p>
<p>settled that this case is not the law. It was directly drawn in
</p>
<p>question and was expressly overruled in Daily v. India <& L. L.
</p>
<p>Assur. Co., decided in the exchequer chamber, 15 C. B. 365.
</p>
<p>It is perhaps true that a policy in favor of a creditor is to be
</p>
<p>regarded as collateral security only where the debtor is under ob-
</p>
<p>ligation to pay the premiums; but where the creditor pays the pre-
</p>
<p>miums, the right of the creditor is absolute ; ' and a creditor who
</p>
<p>insures the life of his debtor, and is obliged to keep alive the policy
</p>
<p>by paying premiums, may hold all he can recover on the policy,
</p>
<p>unless there is a gross disproportion between the debt and the
</p>
<p>amount of the policy."

<p>h. Future Delivery of Stocks, Grain aud Produce. The
</p>
<p>rule at common law that, "articles which had no actual or poten-
</p>
<p>tial existence at the time of the contract, were not subjects of
</p>
<p>sale," was at one time well recognized. But it was found that
</p>
<p>this was too restrictive upon commercial transactions. The manu-
</p>
<p>facturer, desiring to contract for the delivery of his product at a
</p>
<p>future date, wlien the purchaser w^ould find use for it, if excluded
</p>
<p>from contracting for the raw material deliverable to him at a
</p>
<p>fixed price a sutficient time before it was to be operated upon,
</p>
<p>was compelled to purchase in the present market, and store the
</p>
<p>article until he could make it available for manufacturing pur-
</p>
<p>poses.
</p>
<p>There was thus, the investment of capital without interest, the
</p>
<p>cost of storage, the hazard of decay and loss by fire or casualty,
</p>
<p>as well as loss of weight and measure, and expense of cooperage

<p>an intent to actually deliver tlie stock, and at common law, they
</p>
<p>are legal and valid.'
</p>
<p>Such [contracts, although entered into for pure j^urposes of
</p>
<p>speculation, however censurable, are, nevertheless, not prohibited
</p>
<p>by law unless, as in some states, by special statute;"" even though the
</p>
<p>seller has not the goods nor any other means of getting them than
</p>
<p>to go into the market and buy them.'
</p>
<p>The law is now well settled that the sale of goods to be deliv-
</p>
<p>ered in the future is valid. Such a contract is valid, although
</p>
<p>there is an option as to the time of delivery and though the seller
</p>
<p>has no other means of acquiring than to go upon the market and
</p>
<p>order them ; but if, under the guise of such a contract, valid on
</p>
<p>its face, the real purpose and intention of the parties is merely to
</p>
<p>speculate on the rise or fall of prices, and the goods are not to be
</p>
<p>delivered, but the difference between the contracts and market
</p>
<p>price only paid, then the transaction is a wager, and the contract
</p>
<p>is void. It is not enough, however, to render the contract void
</p>
<p>that only one party intends by it a speculation in prices ; it must
</p>
<p>be shown that both parties did not intend a delivery of the goods,
</p>
<p>but contemplated and intended a settlement only of differences.
</p>
<p>The burden of sliowing the' invalidity of the contract rests upon

<p>the party asserting it.*

</p>
<p>Where the parties intend to speculate upon the future market
</p>
<p>and to settle the profit or loss upon the differences, there can be

</p>
<p>In Iowa and in Maine the same doctrine is held.'

<p>Losses sustained by buying and selling what is commonly called

</p>
<p>While the courts recognize the legitimacy of these transactions^

<p>tions,* yet, where the form of a future sale is resorted to, the real pur-

<p>rise and fall of the prices, and the goods are not to be de-livered?

<p>But the intention of one party to settle by payment of differ-
</p>
<p>ence in value between the dates will not render the contract void

</p>

</p>
<p>Where one of the parties has purchased stock on a margin, an
</p>
<p>agreement to share profits or losses on sale of the stock is not
</p>
<p>illegal as a wager or stock-jobbing contract."
</p>
<p>The fact that the vendor does not then own the j^roperty will
</p>
<p>not render its sale for future delivery a wager or void contract,

</p>
<p>the future price.'
</p>
<p>It is not enough to render the contract void, that only one
</p>
<p>party intends by it a siDCculation in prices. It must be shown
</p>
<p>that neither party intends a delivery of the goods, but contemplates
</p>
<p>and intends a settlement only, of differences.*
</p>
<p>Wliere there is a mutual intent that the purchase shall never be
</p>
<p>consummated, that there shall be no delivery, and that the trans-
</p>
<p>action shall be merely a gambling or wagering transaction, to win
</p>
<p>or lose money according to the advance or decrease of the price of
</p>
<p>the article, the contract is invalid as a gambling contract. But an
</p>
<p>intention of one of the parties only that it shall be a gambling
</p>
<p>transaction will not make it so/ if the other party acts in good
</p>
<p>faith, and carries out the contract by buymg and selling as in-

</p>
<p>In transactions upon the stock exchanges, where the sale of
</p>
<p>futures in stock securities are contemplated, there have grown up
</p>
<p>various forms of contracts in sellers' or buyers' "options," which
</p>
<p>are desiijnated by appropriate names. Among these are what are
</p>
<p>styled '-puts" and "calls." A "put" being the privilege, for a cer-
</p>
<p>tain consideration, of delivering, or not delivering, personalty
</p>
<p>within a certain time at a specified price. The person who makes
</p>
<p>such a contract and receives the consideration, contracts that he
</p>
<p>will accept and pay for the specified articles. A "call" is the
</p>
<p>privilege of calling or not calling for the subject matter of the
</p>
<p>contract.
</p>
<p>The one receiving the consideration agrees to deliver, at the
</p>
<p>option of the party to whom it is given or his order, at a time
</p>
<p>named, certain stocks, securities or goods, at a certain price.
</p>
<p>"Puts" and "calls" are merely options to sell or buy.^
</p>
<p>The true idea of an oj^tion is impressed within the terms "puts"
</p>
<p>and "calls," the former being the privilege of delivering or not
</p>
<p>delivering the thing sold; tlie latter, being the privilege of calling
</p>
<p>or not calling for the thing bought'
</p>
<p>A contract for the sale of corporate stock to be delivered at the
</p>
<p>expiration of twelve months, with the seller's option to deliver at
</p>
<p>any time during that period, is prima facie valid, and not found-
</p>
<p>ed on a gambling consideration so as to render it void under Ala.

<p>Code, 1742/
</p>
<p>A contract reciting that for a certain consideration one agrees
</p>
<p>to sell to another certain stock for a certain sum, "if taken on or
</p>
<p>before'' a certain future day, is a contract to give the latter the
</p>
<p>option to buy stock at a future time.^
</p>
<p>Where the double privilege of a "put" and "call" is given,
</p>
<p>securing to the holder the right to demand of the seller at an

<p>fact is specified in the "call." Whereas, in the "put," the one
</p>
<p>who agrees to receive, is entitled to all dividends or extra divi-

<p>FUTURE DELIVERY OF STOCKS, GRAIX AND PRODUCE. 45
</p>
<p>An agreement by the seller of stock to repurchase it at the end of
</p>
<p>three years for a sum equal to the original purchase price, with
</p>
<p>simple interest at 10 per cent, is not a gambling contract, under
</p>
<p>111. Rev. Stat., chap. 38,  130, making it a penal offense to give
</p>
<p>an option to sell or buy stock, etc., at a future time.' But an
</p>
<p>agreement to make a "corner" in stock, by buying it up so as to
</p>
<p>control the market and then purchasing for future deliveries, is
</p>
<p>illegal.'
</p>
<p>On the Cotton Exchange, the transaction not contemplating
</p>
<p>present delivery, is called a "future." A contract with a broker
</p>
<p>to purchase for defendant "cotton futures" on a margin, by which
</p>
<p>the purchase or delivery of actual cotton was never contemplated
</p>
<p>by either party, but the settlement was to be made between the
</p>
<p>parties by one party paying to the other the difference between
</p>
<p>the contract price and the market price of said cotton futures,
</p>
<p>according to the fluctuations in the market,  is a wagering con-
</p>
<p>tract and void.*
</p>
<p>In the Produce Exchange, the "option" is as to the day when
</p>
<p>the delivery may be made or demanded. On the Cotton Exchange,
</p>
<p>all stipulations or understandings that no actual delivery of cotton
</p>
<p>is to be made are forbidden. The rules provide, that deliver-
</p>
<p>ies of cotton shall be made in this manner: The seller must give
</p>
<p>written notice to the buyer that he will deliver on a day named.
</p>
<p>If the seller has resold the goods, he passes the notice to his ven-
</p>
<p>dee, accompanied with a transferable order, and so on, until it
</p>
<p>reaches a vendee who has not sold. The seller must then dehver
</p>
<p>to this buyer, an order on a warehouse or place of delivery before
</p>
<p>VA M. of the day preceding that on which the delivery is due;
</p>
<p>if the buyer has not resold, he is bound to present the order and
</p>
<p>receive and pay for the goods. If he has sold, he passes the order
</p>
<p>to his vendee, and so on until it reaches a vendee who has not
</p>
<p>sold, and he is bound to receive and pay for the goods at the
</p>
<p>original contract price; the difference between that price and that
</p>
<p>of each subsequent sale being settled between the immediate par-

<p>ties to each sale. Delivery orders must be received by any mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the exchange, to whom goods of the kind called for are
</p>
<p>due from another member. The equivalent of this system exists
</p>
<p>in most exchanges.
</p>
<p>Among London bankers settlements are effected each day,
</p>
<p>through what is called the "Clearing House" through a committee
</p>
<p>appointed by the bankers. Each house transmits, during the day,
</p>
<p>the checks and bills which it receives on the others, and keeps a
</p>
<p>note of the obligations coming against itself. Accounts are closed
</p>
<p>at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The bills and checks are classified
</p>
<p>at the "Clearing House" and at a later hour the accounts are
</p>
<p>adjusted; each bank paying or receiving the balance due by or to it.
</p>
<p>The same system is adopted by the New York banks. And
</p>
<p>this system has been applied in the various stock exchanges
</p>
<p>where the agency of a trust company is generally employed to
</p>
<p>adjust mutual accounts of the members of the exchange, who
</p>
<p>agree that deliveries shall be made under the superintendence of
</p>
<p>such trust company; deliveries being settled by delivery orders or
</p>
<p>certificates. This method of delivery by warehouse receipts, cer-
</p>
<p>tificates or delivery orders has been recognized in the courts.'
</p>
<p>Many transactions are however settled outside the clearing
</p>
<p>houses. Take a transaction when a commission merchant is act-
</p>
<p>ing for two dealers. He sells, for present or future delivery, grain
</p>
<p>at 30 cents a bushel to A, while the latter has sold a like amount
</p>
<p>for 40 cents a bushel to B. And B it turns out has sold the
</p>
<p>same quantity for delivery to the commission merchant at 60
</p>
<p>cents, l^ow, when the commission merchant on demand receives
</p>
<p>the grain from his principal, he delivers it to A, and receives the
</p>
<p>30 cents per bushel. A delivers it to B and collects the 40 cents
</p>
<p>due, and B in turn delivers it to the commission merchant, and
</p>
<p>receives 60 cents per bushel, and then settles with his second
</p>
<p>principal and collects the 60 cents per bushel from him. On
</p>
<p>these transactions he charges his commissions.
</p>
<p>If the details of this transaction are not literally worked out,

<p>second principal, and pay to A 10 cents per bushel, and to B 20
</p>
<p>cents per bushel, the amount of advance accruing to each, dis-
</p>
<p>pensing with the intermediate deliveries. This is styled 'a ring"
</p>
<p>and the completion or settlement of the transaction a "ringing
</p>
<p>out." This method is used in settling accounts between commis-
</p>
<p>sion merchants, where one has sold for one customer, and pur-
</p>
<p>chased a like amount, for an identical delivery, for another, deal-
</p>
<p>ing with some other commission merchant, who has been acting
</p>
<p>for other investors. This method of settlement cannot be enforced
</p>
<p>against the customers (unless they be held chargeable with knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of an existing rule), as they may demand the actual delivery
</p>
<p>of the grain, and thus defeat a "ring" settlement.
</p>
<p>To meet the difficulty that a commission merchant may be
</p>
<p>"rung out" in a genuine transaction, where he has contracted tO'
</p>
<p>deliver the actual cotton to a particular customer, who desires to
</p>
<p>enforce the contract, the Kew York Cotton Exchange has
</p>
<p>adopted a new rule, declaring that all orders for future delivery
</p>
<p>transactions in cotton are understood to permit the commission
</p>
<p>merchant to substitute other contracts for like delivery, for con-
</p>
<p>tracts which have been "rung out," and this he may do without
</p>
<p>notification to his principal. As the commission merchant
</p>
<p>guarantees the contract personally, this can work no wrong to the
</p>
<p>customer, who is never known in the transaction except to his
</p>
<p>commission merchant, and who relies entirely on the broker and
</p>
<p>not on the party to the contract, who is unknown to him. The
</p>
<p>rule of the 'New York Cotton Exchange, enforces this " ring "
</p>
<p>method of settlement among its members, when any of them are
</p>
<p>found in a ring of contracts. Many of the stock exchanges, some
</p>
<p>of them in compliance with statute enactments, and some under
</p>
<p>their rules, require settlements through a clearing house.
</p>
<p>It has been said that "ring" settlements are valid.' These set-
</p>
<p>tlements are but giving practical effect to the clearing house
</p>
<p>method, and it has been held, that the rule of a board of trade,
</p>
<p>where cross trades exist between the commission merchants under

</p>
<p>The rules and regulations adopted by the New Orleans Cotton
</p>
<p>Exchange in the settlement and substitution of contracts for the
</p>
<p>future delivery of cotton, when not used to promote a gambling
</p>
<p>transaction, are valid and legal, and are binding upon all persons
</p>
<p>familiar with such rules and regulations, or chargeable with knowl-
</p>
<p>edge thereof, when they employ members of said exchange to
</p>
<p>buy or sell, on the floor of said exchange, cotton for future deliv-
</p>
<p>ery, who in good faith buy and sell in accordance with the said
</p>
<p>rules and regulations."
</p>
<p>Settlements of bona fide contracts for the sale of actual wheat
</p>
<p>by offsets, under the rules and regulations of a board of trade, do
</p>
<p>not affect the validity of the contract if the original intent was to
</p>
<p>purchase and receive the actual wheat.'
</p>
<p>Ln the stock exchanges the call by either party for a margin of
</p>
<p>10 per cent, and keeping this margin good, when from fluctations in
</p>
<p>the stock it is reduced below 5 per cent is authorized. So in
</p>
<p>produce exchanges the margin rate is fixed specially, upon vari-
</p>
<p>ous grains and upon pork, lard, etc. Upon this question the
</p>
<p>courts have ruled that if a contract for the future delivery is law-
</p>
<p>ful, the putting up of margins to cover losses which may accrue
</p>
<p>from fluctuations in prices does not render it an unlawful transac-
</p>
<p>tion.*
</p>
<p>The bm-den of showing that no actual contract was contem-
</p>
<p>plated, but a mere wager upon a future price of the commodities,
</p>
<p>rests upon the party asserting it.* But where doubt is cast upon

<p>FUTURE DELIVERY OF STOCKS, GRAIN AND PRODUCE. 4^
</p>
<p>the validity of a contract for tlie sale of grain, by the testimony,
</p>
<p>it rests upon the party claiming any rights under it to make it
</p>
<p>satisfactorily and affirmatively appear that the contract was made
</p>
<p>with the intention to deliver the grain.'
</p>
<p>Where the statutes forbid short sales of stock, the seller, to
</p>
<p>enfore his contract, must show he was the owner at the time of
</p>
<p>sale.'
</p>
<p>By the common law of England, wagers respecting matters
</p>
<p>which involve neither scandal nor matters inimical to good order
</p>
<p>were lawful; but the common law on this subject has never been
</p>
<p>adopted in most of the states, not harmonizing with colonial
</p>
<p>policy.'
</p>
<p>Generally, in this country, all wagering contracts are treated as
</p>
<p>illegal and void, as being against public policy.*
</p>
<p>In England, since the statutes of 8 and 9 Yict., chap. 109,  18,
</p>
<p>a contract in the form of a future sale of stocks, where neither
</p>
<p>party contemplated a real transaction, but simply intended to
</p>
<p>settle differences, is held a gambling transaction and not enforce-
</p>
<p>able.^
</p>
<p>In Thacker v. Hardy ^ L. R. 4 Q. B. Div. 685, the court found
</p>
<p>that the plaintiff was employed to make contracts, and ruled that
</p>
<p>the understanding between the plaintiff and his customer, that the
</p>
<p>contract should be so managed that only differences in prices
</p>
<p>should be paid, did not violate this statute. Lindley, J!, in giv-
</p>
<p>ing the opinion at the trial, said: "What the plaintiff was
</p>
<p>-employed to do, was to buy and sell in the stock exchange, and
</p>
<p>this he did; and everything he did was perfectly legal, unless it

</p>
<p>was I'endered illegal as between the defendant and liiniself, by
</p>
<p>reason of the illea;ality of the object they had in view, or of the
</p>
<p>transaction in which they were engaged. IS^ow, if gaming and
</p>
<p>wagering were illegal, I shonld be of the opinion that the illegal-
</p>
<p>ity of the transaction would have tainted, as between themselves,
</p>
<p>whatever the plaintifE had done in furtherance of their illegal
</p>
<p>designs, and would have precluded him from claiming, in a court
</p>
<p>of law, any indemnity from the defendant in respect of the lia-
</p>
<p>bilities he had incurred.' But it has been held that, although
</p>
<p>gaming and wagering contracts cannot be enforced, they are not
</p>
<p>illegal. Fitch v. Jones^ 5 El. & Bl. 238, is plain to that effect."
</p>
<p>On appeal Brett, Z. /!, said: "It was further suggested in
</p>
<p>Cooper V. Nell,, Weekly Notes, June 1, 1878, that the agree-
</p>
<p>ment was that, although the plaintiff, being broker to the defend-
</p>
<p>ant, but contracting in his own person as principal, should enter
</p>
<p>into real bargains, yet the defendant should be called upon only
</p>
<p>to pay the loss if the market should be unfavorable, and should
</p>
<p>receive only the prolit if it proved favorable; and that no further
</p>
<p>liability should accrue to the principal whatever might become of
</p>
<p>the broker upon the stock exchange; so that, as regarded the real
</p>
<p>principal, the defendant in the action, it should be a mere gam-
</p>
<p>bling transaction. I then considered that a transaction of that
</p>
<p>kind might fall within the provisions of 8 and 9 Yict., chap. 109,
</p>
<p> 18, but I thought that there was no evidence of it. And with,
</p>
<p>respect to the present action I say that there is no evidence that
</p>
<p>the bargain between the parties amounted to a transaction of that
</p>
<p>nature. I retract nothing from what I said in that case."
</p>
<p>In England wagering contracts concerning stocks or merchan-
</p>
<p>dise are not void at common law, and all the judges in Thacker
</p>
<p>V. Hardy were of opinion that the facts in that case did not show
</p>
<p>that the transactions between the parties were in violation of the
</p>
<p>statute.
</p>
<p>In IriDin v. Wllliar, 110 U. S. 499, 510, 28 L. ed. 225, 230, the
</p>

</p>
<p>them illegal, but only non-enforceable; while generally in this
</p>
<p>country all wagering contracts are held to be illegal and void as
</p>
<p>against public policy.'
</p>
<p>In the various states there has been much experimental legisla-
</p>
<p>tion aimed at gambling in stocks, and creating artificial corners in
</p>
<p>the grain and produce market.
</p>
<p>In Alabama, the code section 1742 is not construed so as to
</p>
<p>render void a sale of stock of a corporation deliverable a year
</p>
<p>from date, with an option to deliver at any earlier date that the
</p>
<p>purchaser may choose.'
</p>
<p>In Arkansas, the Act of March 30, 1883, to prohibit dealing in
</p>
<p>futures, is not in restraint of trade. It does not prevent contracts
</p>
<p>for future delivery when entered into in good faith and with an
</p>
<p>actual intention of fulfillment, but is intended to suppress mere
</p>
<p>speculations upon chances, where the grain, cotton, or stocks dealt
</p>
<p>in exist only in imagination, and where no delivery is contem-
</p>
<p>plated, but the parties expect to settle upon the difference in the
</p>
<p>market. The written contracts for future purchase and delivery
</p>
<p>are not conclusive upon the question of good faith. The real
</p>
<p>question always is. Did the parties intend an actual, bona fide sale,
</p>
<p>or a wager? One who acts as a broker in dealing in futures is
</p>
<p>particeps criminis and punishable as principal. An indictment
</p>
<p>for dealing in futures, in the language of the statute, is sufficient.'
</p>
<p>In California a purchase of stock by a broker for his customer,
</p>
<p>who puts up a margin, and, aside from commissions and interest,
</p>
<p>simply receives or pays the diiference between the buying and
</p>
<p>selling values, is invalid under Cal. Const., art. 4,  26, as a sale of
</p>
<p>stock on margin, and can give the broker no right to enforce the
</p>
<p>customer's indebtedness to him thereon,* But a wager upon in-
</p>
<p>different matters, not involving questions of morality or police.
</p>
<p>is valid." And this is true in Delaware also.^ In Connecticut

</p>
<p>a contract to be discharged by payment of differences is in-
</p>
<p>valid.!
</p>
<p>In Georgia, by statute, a sale of goods to be delivered at a fu-
</p>
<p>ture day, where both parties are aware the seller expects to
</p>
<p>purchase himself to make the delivery, and no skill, labor or
</p>
<p>expense enters into the consideration, but the same is a pure
</p>
<p>speculation, cannot be enforced by either party. Code,  2636.
</p>
<p>Contracts for the purchase and sale of cotton futures are
</p>
<p>gaming contracts, and immoral, illegal, and contrary to public
</p>
<p>policy; and all evidences of debt executed on such a considera-
</p>
<p>tion are void in the hands of any person, even though it be a bona
</p>
<p>fide purchaser before due and without notice." Losses sustained
</p>
<p>by buying and selUng wliat is commonly called "futures" cannot
</p>
<p>be recovered in a court of law,*
</p>
<p>In Illinois, wagers are not prohibited generally.* But when a
</p>
<p>contract is precisely within the letter and spirit of the statute
</p>
<p>airainst wagers it is void, without regard to the question of intent."
</p>
<p>IS^either party to a partnership venture in the business of making
</p>
<p>books on horse races in violation of law can obtain the aid of the
</p>
<p>court for the purpose of securing his share of the funds in the
</p>
<p>other's hands. Money advanced, either as a loan or on joint ac-
</p>
<p>count, to be bet on a horse race cannot be recovered.' A sale or
</p>
<p>purchase of actual wheat for future delivery is not invalid under
</p>
<p>the Illinois statute against option contracts.'' An option as to
</p>
<p>time of delivery is not prohibited.'
</p>
<p>But the purchase of 150 cars of coal, with a privilege of taking
</p>
<p>250 cars more, is void as to the 250 cars as a wagering contract
</p>
<p>under the statute making illegal an option to buy or sell at a fu-
</p>
<p>ture time any grain or commodity.'

</p>
<p>between the contract and tlie market price is not necessary to
</p>
<p>make an agreement void as an option contract under 111. Crim.
</p>
<p>Code,  130. And a contract for a sale of stock, "if taken on or
</p>
<p>before" a certain day, is void as an option contract, under such
</p>
<p>Code, although it would not be void at common law.' Where no
</p>
<p>delivery is intended the contract is illegal.^
</p>
<p>In Indiana where a commodity is bought for future delivery,
</p>
<p>no matter what the contract is, if it is mutually understood and
</p>
<p>intended that the purchaser shall pay for and the seller shall de-
</p>
<p>liver the commodity at the maturity of the contract, the contract
</p>
<p>is legal and valid; and the fact that the purchaser is required to
</p>
<p>deposit a margin and increase the same at any time the market
</p>
<p>requires it, in order to receive payment at maturity, or that tiie
</p>
<p>seller shall deposit a margin in order to secure delivery, does not
</p>
<p>vitiate the contract. But if such a contract does not intend future
</p>
<p>payment and delivery, but only loss or gain of the margins, it is
</p>
<p>illegal and void as a o-ambling contract.^
</p>
<p>If under the guise of a contract which has the appearance of
</p>
<p>validity upon its face, the real intention is merely to speculate on
</p>
<p>the rise or fall of the market, without any purpose that any prop-
</p>
<p>erty shall be delivered or received, but with the understanding
</p>
<p>that at the appointed time the account is to be adjusted by paying
</p>
<p>or receiving the difference between the contract and the current
</p>
<p>price, then the whole transaction is illegal, as against public pol-
</p>
<p>icy, and falls under the condemnation of the law."
</p>
<p>It is said in Sondheim v, Gilbert, that in order to uphold a
</p>
<p>judgment which invalidates commercial paper in the hands of
</p>
<p>innocent holders, it is essential that a statute should be shown
</p>
<p>ffovernino; the case, which in direct terms declares that transactions
</p>
<p>on which the paper is based, are unlawful, and that notes given
</p>
<p>under the circumstances exhibited by the facts are absolutely
</p>
<p>void. The principle may be considered as well established that
</p>
<p>when a statute in express terms pronounces contracts, notes, bills,
</p>
<p>securities and the like, resulting from or growing out of wagering

<p>or gambling transactions, which are prohibited by statute, abso-
</p>
<p>kitely void, no recovery can be had thereon; and the doctrine
</p>
<p>that transactions which a statute in direct terms declares to be
</p>
<p>unlawful cannot acquire validity by the transfer of commercial
</p>
<p>paper based thereon, which is also under direct legislative denun-
</p>
<p>ciation, is fully supported by authority.'
</p>
<p>In such a case the note will be declared void in the hands of an
</p>
<p>innocent holder, in pursuance of the peremptory words of a stat-
</p>
<p>ute which embraces in its terms the contract or obligation under
</p>
<p>consideration,^
</p>
<p>The authorities justify the statement that a defendant may in-
</p>
<p>sist upon the illegality of the contract or consideration, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing the note in the hands of an innocent holder for value, in
</p>
<p>all those cases in which he can point to an express declaration of
</p>
<p>the Legislature that the illegality insisted upon shall make the
</p>
<p>security, whether contract, bill or note, void; but unless the Leg-
</p>
<p>islature has so declared, then, no matter how illegal or immoral
</p>
<p>the consideration may be, a commercial note, in the hands of an
</p>
<p>innocent holder for value, will be held valid and enforceable.'
</p>
<p>Where the facts make it clear that the transactions contem-
</p>
<p>plated were not the actual purchase and acceptance of cotton, but
</p>
<p>were speculative wagers uj^on the price of that commodity, from
</p>
<p>time to time, as it might be quoted on the New York Cotton
</p>
<p>Exchange, the agreement is to engage in mere wild speculation,
</p>
<p>in the nature of gambling or wagering upon the fluctuations in
</p>
<p>the price of cotton. Such transactions demoralize and embarrass
</p>
<p>legitimate trade, and are subversive of all correct business princi-
</p>
<p>ples, destructive of commercial integrity and morality, and result,
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly, in most of the bankruptcies, defalcations
</p>
<p>and forgeries which startle and distract business circles. Between

</p>
<p>by construction so as to include acts not in terms forbidden,
</p>
<p>merely because of their resemblance to the acts prohibited, or
</p>
<p>because they may be equally demoralizing and injurious.'
</p>
<p>The statutes against gaming, which render all wagers, bets and
</p>
<p>stakes unlawful, and avoid all contracts for or on account of any
</p>
<p>money wagered or bet, or any notes or other securities, when the
</p>
<p>whole or any part of the consideration thereof shall be for money
</p>
<p>won or lost on any game or wager, and statutes which make it a
</p>
<p>criminal offense to bet upon any game, or the like, although not
</p>
<p>applicable in term to the purchase of options, are sufficiently
</p>
<p>indicative of the policy of the law as respects mere wagering con-
</p>
<p>tracts, of whatever description or name, to require the court to pro-
</p>
<p>nounce all such contracts and securities invalid in the hands of
</p>
<p>those who were implicated in violating public policy by specifically
</p>
<p>aiding or directly participating in the furtherance of such trans-
</p>
<p>actions. They do not, however, go to the extent of destroying
</p>
<p>commercial securities in the hands of innocent holders for value,
</p>
<p>even though such securities may have had their inception in a
</p>
<p>transaction thus condemned.
</p>
<p>But a note given for a gambling debt is not valid and collectible
</p>
<p>in the hands of an assignee who purchased with knowledge that
</p>
<p>the note was given for such debt, but after a statement made to
</p>
<p>him by the maker that the note was all right and would be paid,
</p>
<p>where it does not appear that he relied upon or was deceived by
</p>
<p>such statement."
</p>
<p>In Iowa, a note given for " Bohemian oats " purchased pursu-
</p>
<p>ant to an agreement that the transaction is of a speculative char-
</p>
<p>acter, and is not based upon the real value of the grain, is not
</p>
<p>void on the ground that it was given pursuant to a gambling con-
</p>
<p>tract, within the meaning of Iowa Code,  4029, as the agreement
</p>
<p>does not rest upon any condition.'
</p>
<p>Contracts for the future delivery of grain, where a delivery in
</p>
<p>fact is contemplated, are legitimate, even though the parties may

<p>4 cents per pound, made in consideration of the payment of $30^
</p>
<p>and an agreement by the other party to pay the guarantor any

<p>excess in the selling price above 4 cents per pound is a gambling
</p>
<p>contract." So is a contract to settle differences.^
</p>
<p>In Kansas the Statute covers all devices for gaming or wagering
</p>
<p>and declares them criminal, and in Cohh v. Prell, 15 Fed. Rep.
</p>
<p>774, the court said that the case turns upon the question whether
</p>
<p>or not it was the intention of the parties that the corn should be
</p>
<p>delivered.
</p>
<p>In Kentucky the intended settlement by payment of difference
</p>
<p>is held void as a wagering contract.* The device known as a
</p>
<p>" bucket shop," being a mere wager on the future price of grain^
</p>
<p>is illegal.^
</p>
<p>In Massachusetts wagers are invalid." There, under a statute, a
</p>
<p>party must be the owner of shares he attempts to sell, or he must
</p>
<p>be the agent of the owner, and he must prove this fact. But this
</p>
<p>will not prevent a recovery by a broker, who has rendered him-

</p>
<p>In Maryland a contract to purchase shares of stock, without

<p>the intention to deliver, is a gambling contract; and, the con-
</p>
<p>tract being for the purchase of stocks, bonds, and grain in other
</p>
<p>states, deliveries to be made in Pennsylvania, the law of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania would govern an action by the broker for money ad-
</p>
<p>vanced.
</p>
<p>AVhere a contract between principals is a mere w^agering one,
</p>
<p>the broker cannot recover for services, money advanced, interest
</p>
<p>on sales, the purchase of stock, etc. The fact that the broker
</p>
<p>acted only in negotiating the contract, and is not suing to enforce
</p>
<p>the original contract, but only for services, etc., makes no differ-
</p>
<p>ence.^
</p>
<p>Dealings in margins are gambling contracts and not enforceable.'
</p>
<p>In Maine wagers are invalid,^ and payment 'of differences, if
</p>
<p>intended in making the contract, renders it void.* In Michigan
</p>
<p>the same result follows.*
</p>
<p>In Mississippi a contract of sale for the future delivery of cot-

</p>
<p>settlement by the payment of the difference between the contract
</p>
<p>price and the market price w^hen the delivery is to be made.'

</p>
<p>The defense that the contract sued on was a wagering contract
</p>
<p>must be specially pleaded. It cannot be shown under the general
</p>
<p>issue."
</p>
<p>A contract contemplating the mere payment of differences will
</p>
<p>not be sustained.^
</p>
<p>In jSTebraska it is ruled that in determining upon the validity of
</p>
<p>contracts to purchase and receive grain, although the outward
</p>
<p>forms of law may have been complied with, yet where the defense
</p>
<p>is that the contract is a wagering one, and not intended for the
</p>
<p>actual sale and delivery of the property, it is the duty of the
</p>
<p>courts to go behind the contract, and examine the facts and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances which attended the making of it, in order to ascertain
</p>
<p>its true character. And where doubt is cast upon the real char-
</p>
<p>acter of the transaction, the testimony of the commission merchant
</p>
<p>that he never received a warehouse receipt for the grain he
</p>
<p>-claimed to have purchased, and that he did not know where it
</p>
<p>was stored, and that he settled the alleged losses by "ringing up"
</p>
<p>in the board of trade, does not show such a bona lide purchase as
</p>
<p>it became his duty to show after doubt was cast upon the matter."
</p>
<p>Money wagered on the result of a horse race may be recovered
</p>
<p>from the stakeholder by the party depositing the same, if, before
</p>
<p>the stake is paid over to the Avinner, a demand has been made
</p>
<p>upon the stakeholder for its return.^
</p>
<p>In ]S^ew Hampshire wagers are treated as void.*

<p>In New Jersey wagers on indifferent questions are not prohibit-

</p>
<p>and all contracts for or on account of any money or property or
</p>
<p>thing in action so wagered, bet or staked is void,*
</p>
<p>Contracts, where authority is actually given to defendants to
</p>
<p>make an executory contract for the sale of stock deliverable at a
</p>
<p>future day, being legal, it is the duty of the courts to protect
</p>
<p>agents who in good faith make them for their principals, but the
</p>
<p>authority must be given and the agency actually assumed. It
</p>
<p>will not do to set up an agency after a loss has happened upon a

<p>vague and indefinite transaction,"
</p>
<p>A contract between coffee brokers doing business upon the
</p>
<p>New York Coffee Exchange and an individual, purporting to be
</p>
<p>for the sale and purchase of coffee, is a w^agering contract, and
</p>
<p>void if the parties intended that there should be no actual deliv-
</p>
<p>ery, but merely speculations as to the future price of the commod-
</p>
<p>ity, with settlements of differences, notwithstanding the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of rules of the exchange rer[uiring actual delivery.'
</p>
<p>In Ohio, all contracts to purchase food products, grain or flesh,,
</p>
<p>the seller not having the property in ownership or the property
</p>
<p>on hand for delivery, or when the purchaser has not the means to
</p>
<p>pay, or there is no intention to deliver or receive, are declared
</p>
<p>void. This condemnation is also extended to stocks and petrole-
</p>
<p>um, and to sales by margins or futures either in person or by
</p>
<p>broker. An offer to sell, accepted or not, is declared a crime ; as
</p>
<p>is the statement of any offer to sell, or quotation of prices of mar.
</p>
<p>gins, futures or options; doing which renders one an accessory and
</p>
<p>punishable as a principal. The Act does not apply to legally
</p>
<p>incorporated produce exchanges, chambers of commerce or boards
</p>
<p>of trade, or to members thereof, or their agents, when transactions
</p>
<p>are done in accordance with the rules, and executed therein ; or
</p>
<p>to persons dealing with or through them, or reporting their trans-
</p>
<p>actions ; and it is declared that the Act shall not apply to or inter-
</p>
<p>fere with legitimate business transactions in the regular course of

<p>trade.*

</p>
<p>In Oregon wagers are not illegal.*
</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania the Statute formerly forbade any contract of
</p>
<p>sale of corporate stock or securities, when it is understood or
</p>
<p>stipulated that the contract may be executed or performed at any
</p>
<p>future time, exceeding five judicial days, next ensuing the date
</p>
<p>of the contract. Laws of 1841, p. 398,  6. This Act has since

</p>
<p>Anything which induces men to risk their money or property,
</p>
<p>without any other hope of return than to get for nothing any
</p>
<p>given amount from another, is gambling.

<p>Every species of gaming contract, whether of insurance by a
</p>
<p>valued policy where the insured has no interest, or the purchase

</p>
<p>A transaction in stocks by way of margin, settlement of differ-
</p>
<p>ence, and payment of gain or loss, without intending to deliver
</p>
<p>stocks, is a mere wager, which the law does not sanction and will
</p>
<p>not carry into effect.^
</p>
<p>It has been held in Pennsylvania and Kew Jersey that if the
</p>
<p>customer intended only to deal in differences, and not to deliver
</p>
<p>himself the actual commodities, it made no difference that the
</p>
<p>broker made actual and enforceable contracts.*

<p>If no intention existed to make a delivery and acceptance, of

<p>jobbing,  and which has been so used, cannot be recovered back

<p>by the lender.
</p>
<p>Where a broker is privy to a wagering contract, and brings the

<p>vices rendered or loss incurred by him in forwarding the transac-

<p>defense by stating that he had none, to the assignee, before his

<p>In Rhode Island a contract in future delivery to be settled in

<p>In Tennessee it is a good defense to a complainant's bill to

<p>no cotton was to be delivered or price paid therefor, and that the

<p>price of cotton.*

<p>In Texas all wagers are recoverable except such as are prohib-

<p>ited by statute, or are against public policy, or tend to affect the

<p>interest, character, or feelings of third parties. A wager on a

<p>A contract for the sale of goods to be delivered at a future day

<p>is valid, even though the seller has not the goods, or any other

<p>means of getting them than to go into the market and buy them ;
</p>
<p>but such a contract is valid only when the [parties really intend

</p>
<p>whole transaction constitutes not king more than a wager, is con-
</p>
<p>trary to public policy, and is void.'
</p>
<p>Under the Statute of Virginia, Code, 1873, jd. 984,  2, as under
</p>
<p>that of Xew York, 1 Kev. Stat. I^J". Y. title 8, art. 3,  8, p. 662,
</p>
<p>money advanced solely for the purpose of carrying "cotton futures,"
</p>
<p>for which the party advancing has contracted with another, cannot
</p>
<p>be recovered, wliere the payment of " differences " only was in-
</p>
<p>tended.' The decision in Brown v. Speyers, 20 Gratt. 96, does
</p>
<p>not conflict with this construction of the Yiro-inia statute.
</p>
<p>In Wisconsin whatever form these engagements assume, if
</p>
<p>neither party actually intend to sell and deliver or buy and pay
</p>
<p>for the article specified, but only mean to call for and pay the-
</p>
<p>diiference between the contract price and the price at a future
</p>
<p>day, the transaction is not enforceable.^
</p>
<p> 3. Courts, iu Matter of Contract, Will first Protect the
</p>
<p>Public  Legislative Action.  It may be regarded as well settled
</p>
<p>that, in the law of contracts, the first purpose of the courts is to
</p>
<p>look to the welfare of the public, and that if tlie enforcement of
</p>
<p>an agreement would be inimical to its interests, no relief can be
</p>
<p>granted to the party injured, although it might result bene-
</p>
<p>ficially to the party who may violate the agreement.
</p>
<p>That a person executed a note given on an illegal consideration,
</p>
<p>with full knowledge of all the facts, is of no moment. The
</p>
<p>defense he makes is not allowed for his sake, but to maintain the
</p>
<p>policy of the law.''

</p>
<p>come within the restriction.'
</p>
<p>Contracts whose tendencies violate moral principles, are disap-
</p>
<p>proved on the grounds of public policy.'
</p>
<p>Contracts which are based upon immoral considerations or
</p>
<p>which require the performance of immoral acts are void. The
</p>
<p>common law proliibits anything which is unjust or contra honos
</p>
<p>mores. ^
</p>
<p>Neither one who knowingly rents a house nor he who knowingly
</p>
<p>furnishes it to be used for the purposes of prostitution can recover
</p>
<p>either the rental value or the price of the goods.*
</p>
<p>When satisfied that a transaction is demoralizing in its charac-
</p>
<p>ter, a court will not hesitate to hold all contracts or promises based
</p>
<p>thereon void as against public morals.*

</p>
<p>It is void as to every person whose riglits would be in any man-
</p>
<p>ner involved if it were legal.'
</p>
<p>A contract to sell letters written by persons afflicted with diseases
</p>
<p>to one advertising to cure such diseases is contra honos mores, and
</p>
<p>void upon grounds of public policy.''
</p>
<p>The right to recover back money paid to a real estate broker
</p>
<p>who has concealed the fact that he was acting for both parties
</p>
<p>rests upon grounds of public policy, and not upon the advantage-
</p>
<p>ous or disadvantageous character of the sale.'
</p>
<p>A contract that one selected to give his best judgment between
</p>
<p>two adverse parties shall be paid in proportion to the sum awarded
</p>
<p>by him against one of the parties, is void as against public policy.*
</p>
<p>The rules that declare certain contracts are void as against pub-
</p>
<p>lic policy, are not to be arbitrarily extended ; for if there is one
</p>
<p>thing more than another that public policy requires it is that per-
</p>
<p>sons of full age and competent understanding shall have the
</p>
<p>utmost liberty, at all consistent with the public good, of contract-
</p>
<p>ing, and that their contracts when entered into freely and volun-
</p>
<p>tarily, shall be held sacred, and shall be enforced by courts of
</p>
<p>justice. This freedom of contract is not lightly to be interfered
</p>
<p>with.' Nor will the illegal contract defeat an action for an injury,
</p>
<p>disconnected with the transaction itself. Thus the rule that courts
</p>
<p>will not enforce immoral or illegal claims cannot affect the liability
</p>
<p>of a railroad company for constructing and operating an elevated
</p>
<p>railway in the street, in front of a house used as a place of prosti-
</p>
<p>tution, when such elevated railway depreciates the rental value of
</p>
<p>tha house for ordinary purposes. The occupation of the house for
</p>
<p>purposes of prostitution does not justify the injury to its value
</p>
<p>g-enerally. The particular use of the house has nothing to do with
</p>
<p>the injmy suffered by its owner from the elevated roadway, but
</p>
<p>the injury is wholly independent of such use. The claim for dam-
</p>
<p>ages does not rest upon the occupation for the special purpose, nor
</p>
<p>does its enforcement sanction nor encourage such use.'

<p>WHEN STATUTES ARE SIMFLY DIKECTOKY. '^"-^
</p>
<p>Contracts to secure the vote of a creditor for the discharge of a
</p>
<p>bankrupt are void,as are all contracts tending to evade the bankrupt
</p>
<p>law.' An agreement by which the creditor of an insolvent is to re-
</p>
<p>ceive money, by which his vote for the assignee is affected, is ille-
</p>
<p>cral  Whether the contract is with the debtor or a stranger, it is
</p>
<p>equally void, ' and whether paid from debtor's assets or else-
</p>
<p>where. * T  4-
</p>
<p>But a promise to prefer a creditor in case of insolvency is not
</p>
<p>invalid where the statutes permit preferences by insolvents.
</p>
<p>And the validity of a mortgage executed by a wife personally
</p>
<p>and not through the agency of her husband, will not be affected
</p>
<p>by his intention to give unlawful preference to the mortgagee and
</p>
<p>have the wife go into insolvency in fraud of the insolvent laws, it
</p>
<p>the mortgagee had no knowledge of the wife's insolvency or of
</p>
<p>the husband's intention. '
</p>
<p>Where a debtor and his general creditors enter into a contract
</p>
<p>of settlement, to which all are understood to be parties, a secret
</p>
<p>agreement made by the debtor, or on his behalf, favoring a par-
</p>
<p>ticular creditor, to secure his assent, is void. '
</p>
<p>8 6 Statutes Simply Directory do not Invalidate Contracts.
</p>
<p> The rule is universally accepted, that if a statute prohibits a con-
</p>
<p>tract in the sense of making it unlawful for anyone to enter into it,
</p>
<p>such a contract, if made, is whoUy void and cannot be enforced.

</p>
<p>But it is not always clear whether a statute forbidding the doing
</p>
<p>of a thing,' or imposing a penalty,^ or enjoining the mode of doing
</p>
<p>it, is prohibitory so as to make any conti-aet in violation of it abso-
</p>
<p>lutely void, or whether it is directory in its purpose, and does not
</p>
<p>necessarily invalidate the contract. The best considered and clear-
</p>
<p>est expressed decisions recognize a clear distinction between these
</p>
<p>two class of cases, although in deciding special cases it is often
</p>
<p>not alluded to and general propositions are stated not apparently
</p>
<p>regarding the distinction. It will be found however that, with
</p>
<p>perhaps a few exceptions, the cases will fall in line under the
</p>
<p>foregoing and following rules.
</p>
<p> 7. Statutes Protecting the Public from Imposition and
</p>
<p>Empiricism ; Exercise of Police Power.
</p>
<p>a. Statutes Requiring Inspection, etc., of Ooods.  Statutes
</p>
<p>in the United States and in England have been enacted in sub-
</p>
<p>stance that goods should only be sold in certain measures or in a
</p>
<p>certain manner, or after being inspected or branded by public
</p>
<p>officers, and it has been held that contracts of sale which do not
</p>
<p>meet the requirements of such statutes are absolutely void, and
</p>
<p>that a contract in violation of a statute imposing a penalty for
</p>
<p>the sale of goods by unsealed scales or measure is void.' The pur-
</p>
<p>pose of such statutes is to protect the buyer from the imposition
</p>
<p>of the seller, a purpose which could not be accomplished unless
</p>
<p>the contracts are held void, and therefore the courts are bound to
</p>
<p>assume this to have been the legislative intent.*
</p>
<p>b. License to Practice Medicine.  A contract made to render
</p>
<p>medical services with one who has not obtained a certificate show-
</p>
<p>ing that he possesses the necessary qualifications, is contrary to pub-
</p>
<p>lic policy and void.^
</p>
<p>A contract to pay a fee for services rendered by a physician
</p>
<p>who is not licensed is void in its inception, where a statute pro-

<p>protect the people from empii'icism, and to elevate the standing
</p>
<p>of the medical profession, declaring it unlawful for a person to
</p>
<p>furnish medicines as a practicing physician, unless authorized to
</p>
<p>practice in accordance with the provisions of the statute, one so
</p>
<p>furnishing medicine cannot recover in a civil action for medicine
</p>
<p>so prescribed as a physician."
</p>
<p>It is within the police power of the State to prescribe rules and
</p>
<p>tests for the ascertainment of the qualifications of applicants for
</p>
<p>authority to practice medicine as a livelihood.^ Such a statute
</p>
<p>may include one who as a physician merely gives electric treat-
</p>
<p>ments.*
</p>
<p>Such statutes, however, do not confer upon the examining
</p>
<p>board the right or power to absolutely disregard the learning and
</p>
<p>qualitications of an apphcant, or to unreasonably or arbitrarily
</p>
<p>reject his claims, or, at will, grant or refuse its certificate or
</p>
<p>license.'
</p>
<p>But if a physician acts under a mistake of fact as to the record
</p>
<p>of his license, he is not liable under the statute to its penalties;'
</p>
<p>^nd a physician who, in consequence of the fact that the proper
</p>
<p>officer did not have a book in which he could register, did not
</p>
<p>succeed in doing so, as required by law, but who was called to
</p>
<p>attend a patient and did so, practicing without such register, can
</p>
<p>recover his fee, where it appears that he did register as soon as
</p>
<p>the book was obtained by the officer, and within the date a writ
</p>
<p>of mandate could have been effective upon the officer. '

<p>for spirituous liquors in the State, to he delivered at a place without

<p>the State for sale, a contract made in violation of thet satute is

<p>void ; * and the seller is chargeable with the knowledge of his
</p>
<p>agents. "
</p>
<p>Where the hiring of a clerk and bookkeeper, by a grocery
</p>
<p>keeper, who also sold liquor illegally, was for one entire consider-
</p>
<p>ation, the employe cannot recover anything on his contract of
</p>
<p>employment, even upon quantum meruit for services in the gro-
</p>
<p>cery part of the business.^
</p>
<p>But where a corporation sold and delivered beer to the keepe:'
</p>
<p>of a house of prostitution, and the agent knew his business, but
</p>
<p>did not know just what was to be done with it, but supposed it
</p>
<p>was to be used or sold in the brothel, a recovery was allowed.*
</p>
<p>But the owner of a building willfully permitting the illegal
</p>
<p>sale within it of liquor, cannot recover rent for its use."
</p>
<p>The court will not recognize a contract between attorneys and

<p>other persons engaged in the illegal sale of liquor to defend all

<p>cases brought against the latter for violations of prohibitory liquor
</p>
<p>laws, in consideration of a certain monthly compensation; as such

<p>a contract is against public policy.*
</p>
<p>Wherever an indictment can be sustained for the illegal sale of
</p>
<p>liquors, there the price cannot be recovered. ''
</p>
<p>But the vendor's mere knowledge that the vendee intends "
</p>
<p>make an unlawful use of the goods sold is not sufficient to invalidate
</p>
<p>the sale. *
</p>
<p>A sale of cigars is not rendered illegal by knowledge of the-

</p>
<p>iiitoxicatiug liquors shipped into a State to a pharmacist, with the
</p>
<p>knowledge that he is forbidden by the state law to sell them as a
</p>
<p>beverage, where the seller, in order to aid him in evading the
</p>
<p>statute, forwards some of the liquors in concealed packages to a fic-
</p>
<p>titious assignee, and furnishes false invoices to aid him in the
</p>
<p>commission of perjury, as well as in other violations of the law,
</p>
<p>although the sale of liquors in itself would be legal. '
</p>
<p>But the law, that an executory contract which contemplates the
</p>
<p>violation of the law of the jjlace or State where the act or thing
</p>
<p>contemplated by the contract is to be done or performed is void,
</p>
<p>does not apply where the party against whom it is sought to have
</p>
<p>the contract adjudged void did not know of any law or policy of
</p>
<p>such State, the violation of which was contemplated by the other
</p>
<p>party, or of the violation by the latter of any such law or policy. "
</p>
<p>In State' v. O'JS^ed, 1 Xew Eng. Kep. 775, 58 Yt. 140, and
</p>
<p>three other cases heard together, the first and most important ques-
</p>
<p>tion presented is, whether or not the intoxicating liquors in
</p>
<p>question were, in the first two cases, in contemplation of law sold^
</p>
<p>or furnished, by the respondent in the county of Rutland and
</p>
<p>State of Vermont; or, in the last two cases, held and kept for the
</p>
<p>purpose of sale, furnishing or distribution contrary to the statute,
</p>
<p>within said county and State. The answer depends upon whether
</p>
<p>the National Express Co. by which some of said liquors were
</p>
<p>delivered to the consignees thereof, and in whose possession the
</p>
<p>remainder were found and seized before the delivery, was in law
</p>
<p>the agent of the vendors or of the vendees. If the purchase and
</p>
<p>sale of the liquors was fully completed in the State of Xew York,
</p>
<p>so that upon delivery of them to the express company for trans-
</p>
<p>portation the title vested in the consignees, as in the case of a
</p>
<p>completed and unconditional sale, then no offense against the laws
</p>
<p>of Vermont has been committed. If, on the other hand, the sale
</p>
<p>by its terms could only become complete so as to pass the title in

<p>ii CONTKACTS AS AFFECTED BY STATUTE.
</p>
<p>The liquors were ordered by residents of Yermont from dealers
</p>
<p>doing business in the State of l^ew York, who selected from their
</p>
<p>stock such quantities and kinds of goods as they thought proper,
</p>
<p>in compliance with the terms of the orders, put them up in pack-
</p>
<p>ages, directed them to the consignees, and delivered them to the
</p>
<p>express company as a common carrier of goods for transporta-
</p>
<p>tion, accompanied with a bill or invoice for collection. The ship-
</p>
<p>ment was, in each instance, C. O. D., and the cases show that the
</p>
<p>effect of the transaction was a direction by the shippers to the
</p>
<p>express company not to deliver the goods to the consignees
</p>
<p>except upon payment of the amount specified in the C. O. D. bills,
</p>
<p>together with the charges for the transportation of the packages
</p>
<p>and for the return of the money paid. This direction was under-
</p>
<p>stood by the express company, which received the shipments
</p>
<p>coupled therewith.
</p>
<p>Whether or not, and when the legal title in property sold passes
</p>
<p>from the vendor to the vendee, is always a question of the inten-
</p>
<p>tion of the parties, which is to be gathered from their acts and all
</p>
<p>the facts and circumstances of the case taken together.
</p>
<p>In order that the title may pass, as was said by Morton, -/!, in M<i-
</p>
<p>^on V. Thoiupson, 18 Pick. 305: "The owner must intend to part
</p>
<p>with his property, and the purchaser to become the immediate
</p>
<p>owner. Their two minds must meet on this point, and if any-
</p>
<p>thing remains to be done before either assents, it may be an
</p>
<p>inchoate contract, but it is not a perfect sale." The authorities
</p>
<p>seem to be uniform on this point; and the acts of the parties are
</p>
<p>regarded as evidence by which the court or jury may ascertain
</p>
<p>and determine their intent.' Wlien there is a condition precedent
</p>
<p>attached to the contract, the title in the property does not pass to
</p>
<p>the vendee until performance or waiver of the condition, even
</p>
<p>though there be an actual delivery of possession. ^ The Yer-
</p>
<p>mont cases to the above points are referred to in Roberts' Digest,
</p>
<p>610, et seq., and need not be specially reviewed here.

<p>ordering the same, to the express company, to be transported by

<p>"that eomj)any and delivered by it to the consignees upon fulfill-
</p>
<p>ment by them of a specified condition precedent, namely: pay-
</p>
<p>ment of the purchase price and transportation charges and not
</p>
<p>otherwise. Attached to the very body of the contract and to the
</p>
<p>act of delivery to the carrier was the condition of payment before
</p>
<p>delivery of possession to the consignee. With this condition
</p>
<p>unfulfilled and not waived, it would be impossible to say that a
</p>
<p>delivery to the carrier was mtended by the consignor as a delivery
</p>
<p>to the consignee, or as a surrender of the legal title. The goods
</p>
<p>were intrusted to the carrier to transport to the place of destina-
</p>
<p>tion named, there to present them for acceptance to the consignee
</p>
<p>-and, if he accepted them and paid the accompanying invoice and
</p>
<p>the transportation charges, to deliver them to him; otherwise to
</p>
<p>notify the consignor and hold them subject to his order. It is
</p>
<p>difficult to see how^ a sellei* could more positively and unequivo-
</p>
<p>cally express his intention not to relinquish his right of property
</p>
<p>or possession in goods, until payment of purchase price, than by
</p>
<p>this method of shipment. The case is undistinguishable in prin-
</p>
<p>ciple from that of a vendor who sends his clerk or agent to deliver
</p>
<p>the goods, or forward them to, or make them deliverable upon
</p>
<p>the order of his agent, with instructions not to deliver them
</p>
<p>except on payment of the price, or performance of some other
</p>
<p>specified condition precedent by the vendee. The vendors made
</p>
<p>the ex])ress company their agent in the matter of the delivery of
</p>
<p>the goods with instructions not to part with the possession of them,
</p>
<p>except upon prior or contemporaneous receipt of the price. The
</p>
<p>contract of sale therefore remained inchoate or executory, while
</p>
<p>the goods were in transit or in the hands of the express company,
</p>
<p>and could only become executed and complete by their delivery to
</p>
<p>the consignees. There was a completed executory contract of sale

<p>held by the company, as the agent of the seller, until the con-
</p>
<p>signee comes and pays the money; and then the company, as the
</p>
<p>agent of the seller, delivers the liquor to the purchaser. In such
</p>
<p>case the possession of the express company is the possession of the
</p>
<p>seller, and generally the right of property remains in. the seller

<p>nntil the payment of the price. An order from a person in Fair-
</p>
<p>field to the defendant at Shawneetown for two gallons of liquor
</p>
<p>to be shipped to Fairfield, C. O. D., is a mere offer by the person
</p>
<p>sending such order to purchase two gallons of liquor from the
</p>
<p>defendant and pay him for it w^ien he delivers it to him at Fair-
</p>
<p>field; and a shipment by the defendant according to such order i^

<p>VIOLATING FOREIGN STATUTE. i 
</p>
<p>of liquor from his store in Shawneetown, and carried it in person
</p>
<p>to Fairfield and there delivered it to the purchaser and received
</p>
<p>the price of it. It would be different if the order from Fairfield
</p>
<p>to the defendant was a simple order to ship two gallons of liquor
</p>
<p>by express to the person ordering, whether such order was accom-
</p>
<p>panied by the money or not. The moment the liquor under such
</p>
<p>an order was delivered to the express company at Shawneetown
</p>
<p>it would become the property of the person ordering, and the
</p>
<p>j)ossession of the express company at Shawneetown would be the
</p>
<p>possession of the purchaser; the sale would be a sale at Shawnee-
</p>
<p>town, and if it were lost or destroyed in transit the loss would fall
</p>
<p>upon the purchaser. But in the case at bar, by the shipping of the
</p>
<p>liquor to Fairfield, C. O. D., the defendant made no sale at Shaw-
</p>
<p>neetown; the right of property remained in himself, and the right
</p>
<p>of possession, as well as the actual possession, remained in him
</p>
<p>through his agent. Had it been lost or destroyed in transit the
</p>
<p>loss would have fallen upon himself. He simply acted upon the
</p>
<p>request of the purchaser, and sent the liquor to Fairfield by his
</p>
<p>own agent, and there effected a sale by receiving the money and
</p>
<p>delivering tlie liquor."
</p>
<p>It is insisted on the part of the claimant in the case of State
</p>
<p>V. Sixty-Eight Jugs, etc., that  2 of ISTo. 43 of the Act of 1882,
</p>
<p>under which the liquors in that case were seized, is unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional. Conceding the points that there is a well recognized right
</p>
<p>of property in intoxicating liquors, that they are not malum in se,
</p>
<p>and that their use is not by law prohibited to citizens of Yermont,
</p>
<p>these propositions are nevertheless clearly subject to the qual-
</p>
<p>ification that when kept and intended for unlawful use, such
</p>
<p>liquors fall at once under the ban of the law and become subject
</p>
<p>to seizure and confiscation by such methods as are provided by
</p>
<p>law in conformity with the Constitution. That intoxicating
</p>
<p>liquors when once branded with this unlawful intent on the part
</p>
<p>of the owner or possessor become subject to confiscation by the

</p>
<p>condemnation are within the police powers delegated to the Leg-
</p>

</p>
<p>to require extended discussion.'

<p>78 CONTKACTS AS AFFECTED BY STATUTE.
</p>
<p>This section gives the officer power to seize without warrant
</p>
<p>liquor found under circumstances warranting the belief that it i^>
</p>
<p>intended for sale or distribution contrary to the provisions of chap.
</p>
<p>169, R. L. It does not purport to confer the power of search;,
</p>
<p>nor does anything appear to show that the officer assumed to ex-
</p>
<p>ercise such power in this case. It simply provides for the seizure
</p>
<p>without warrant previously issued, of something which the law
</p>
<p>has declared subject to seizure and condemnation, under the police
</p>
<p>power delegated by the Constitution, as an instrument intended
</p>
<p>by the owner or possessor for a use unlawful by express statute,
</p>
<p>and dangerous to the peace, health and good morals of the com-
</p>
<p>munity. That the article in itself may be innocuous, may be the
</p>
<p>subject of lawful ownership, or may even be susceptible of bene-
</p>
<p>ficial use, can no more affect the question than could the fact that
</p>
<p>certain tools were susceptible of lawful and beneficial use in me-
</p>
<p>chanics save them from becoming subject to seizure and confisca-
</p>
<p>tion if intended by their owner or possessor for use as the instru-
</p>
<p>ments for accomplishing a contemplated burglary; or the harmless
</p>
<p>character of the metal and its owner's right of property therein
</p>
<p>to protect his ownership when fashioned and intended for passing
</p>
<p>as counterfeit coin.
</p>
<p>It cannot be doubted in Vermont, since the case of Spauldhuj
</p>
<p>V. Preston, 21 Vt. 9, and has not been elsewhere, that article.-
</p>
<p>or instrumentalities once impressed with the characteristics of
</p>
<p>adaptation and intended use for purposes prohibited by law and
</p>
<p>contrary to the public peace, health or morals, are subject to sum-
</p>
<p>mary seizure under statutory or even general police regulations.
</p>
<p>That the liquors in question were intended for such use has been
</p>
<p>determined in this case as a question of fact by the tribunal des-
</p>
<p>ignated by law, and that adjudication is conclusive.
</p>
<p>The scope and appHcation of article 5, pt. 1 of the Constitution
</p>
<p>have been defined in the cases above referred to, and in Re Pow-
</p>
<p>ers, 25 Yt. 265, which has ever since been regarded as conclusive

<p>so CONTKACTS AS AFFECTED BY STATUTE.
</p>
<p>Tlie rule tliat courts will respect the purpose of legislation, in
</p>
<p>the enforcement or refusal to give relief in matters of contract,
</p>
<p>where legislative action has been had on the subject matter of
</p>
<p>the contract, is illustrated in the decisions of the courts under the
</p>
<p>homestead laws of the United States. The homestead is a gift
</p>
<p>from the government to the homesteader, conditioned upon his
</p>
<p>occupation for five years and upon his making no disposition or
</p>
<p>alienation during such term; the affidavit of non-alienation is as
</p>
<p>clear an expression of the legislative intent as a direct prohibition;
</p>
<p>the whole policy of government in this respect would be thwarted
</p>
<p>if the homesteader were permitted to alienate prior to the expira-
</p>
<p>tion of the five years. A successful alienation could be accom-
</p>
<p>plished only by perjury, and an attempted alienation would only
</p>
<p>offer a constant inducement to the homesteader to abandon his
</p>
<p>occupation, and thus deprive the purchaser of any possibility of
</p>
<p>acquiring title to the land; a contract whose consummation neces-
</p>
<p>sarily rests on perjury is illegal; both purchaser and vendor are
</p>
<p>])arties to the wrong, and courts refuse to enforce such a contract,
</p>
<p>not from any regard to the vendor, but from motives of public
</p>
<p>policy; and courts of equity have always exercised a discretion in
</p>
<p>enforcing the specific performance of contracts to convey, and it
</p>
<p>would be strange indeed if a court of equity lent its aid to enforce
</p>
<p>the performance of a contract founded upon perjury and entered
</p>
<p>into in defiance of a clearly expressed will of the government.
</p>
<p>Whether the contract be absolutely void or not, it is so clearly
</p>
<p>against the will and policy of the government, and so necessarily
</p>
<p>resting upon perjury, that a court of equity will have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with it.*
</p>
<p>Similar views were expressed by the Supreme Court of N^ebras-
</p>
<p>ka in the case of Dawson v. Merrille, 2 Neb. 119, in which it was
</p>
<p>held that " the policy of the Act of Congress granting homesteads
</p>
<p>on the pubhc lands, as disclosed by its requirement of affidavit
</p>
<p>and other provisions, is adverse to the right of a party availing

<p>policy." And the judgment of the trial court, denying specific
</p>
<p>performance of a contract for the sale of lands, made by the home-
</p>
<p>steader before he had acquired the legal title to the premises, was
</p>
<p>affirmed/
</p>
<p>An agreement between a person since deceased and others, for
</p>
<p>the purj)ose of locating as mineral land a tract larger than they
</p>
<p>were entitled to under U. S. Eev. Stat.  2331, the names of others
</p>
<p>being used who subsequently conveyed to the parties to the agree-
</p>
<p>ment without consideration, is void and cannot be the basis of
</p>
<p>any relief.^
</p>
<p>When conditions are presented by statute for the management
</p>
<p>of any particular business or profession, and such conditions are
</p>
<p>not observed, agreements made in the course of such business or
</p>
<p>profession are void if it appears by the context that the object of
</p>
<p>the legislature in imposing the conditions was the maintenance of
</p>
<p>public order or safety, or the protection of the persons dealing
</p>
<p>with those on whom the condition is imposed.'
</p>
<p>A contract in violation of the statute imposing a penalty for the
</p>
<p>sale of goods by unsealed scales or measure is void.*
</p>
<p>A judgment obtained for services in hulling clover will be
</p>
<p>reversed where the evidence shows that the plaintiff refused to com-
</p>
<p>ply with the statute in regard to the protection of tumbling rods.^
</p>
<p>But if no specific penalty is affixed by the statute to the partic-
</p>
<p>ular transaction and the context shows that while the statute does
</p>
<p>not in terms declare the transaction void, the condition was simply
</p>
<p>imposed for administrative purposes, that is, to aid in the collec-

<p>be to avoid the act.' Before the rule can be appHed in any case
</p>
<p>of a statute prohibiting or enjoining things to be done, with a pro-
</p>
<p>hibition and a penalty or a penalty, only for doing a thing which
</p>
<p>it forbids, the statute must be examined as a whole to iind out
</p>
<p>whether or not the makers of it meant that a contract in contra-
</p>
<p>vention of it should be void, or that it was not to be so.' If the
</p>
<p>statute, although it forbids a contract, declares it shall not be
</p>
<p>void if made, the court must give it effect,'
</p>
<p>b. Penalty for Performing Marriage Ceremony.  Where a
</p>
<p>statute imposes a penalty on an officer for solemnizing a marriage
</p>
<p>under certain circumstances, but does not declare the marriage
</p>
<p>void, the marriage is valid, but the penalty attaches to the officer
</p>
<p>who did the prohibited act. *
</p>
<p>c. Usury Laws.  Where a bank is limited by its charter to a
</p>
<p>specified rate of interest, but no penal consequence is denounced
</p>
<p>for taking more, it has been held that a contract for more is not
</p>
<p>wholly void. '
</p>
<p>Where usurious contracts are forbidden under a penalty of for-
</p>
<p>feiture of three times the interest taken, the act of making such a
</p>
<p>contract is illegal, but to hold the contract wholly void would be
</p>
<p>to add another penalty to that imposed. *
</p>
<p>d. Internal Revenue Laws.  That a wholesale dealer failed
</p>
<p>to comply with the provision of the internal revenue laws of the
</p>
<p>United States prohibiting any person from carrying on the busi-
</p>
<p>ness of wholesale dealers in merchandise until they had paid the
</p>
<p>special tax, did not invalidate the sales made by him or prevent his
</p>
<p>recovery for the goods sold.

<p>vention of the statute, such illegal action does not render the in-

<p>vestment worthless. ' The requirement that a national bank shall
</p>
<p>limit its loans to any one person, firm or corporation to one tenth
</p>
<p>part of its paid capital and forbidding the taking of real estate as
</p>
<p>collateral security for original debts, does not render securities
</p>

</p>
<p>where offered, did not invalidate an actual sale of shingles not so

</p>

<p>required of sellers of commercial manures the observance of cer-
</p>
<p>tain conditions, under penalty, but did not declare contracts for
</p>
<p>sale void for non-observance, it was held the non-complying seller
</p>
<p>might recover upon the contract. ""
</p>
<p>An action to recover for services rendered with a threshing-

<p>rule that a contract made for the purpose of furthering any mat-

<p>ter or thing prohibited by the statute, or to aid or assist any party
</p>

<p>Illegal contracts are not such only as stipulate for something

<p>has long since been exploded, and as " there can be no civil right

<p>LOCAL POLICY OK STATUTE STATE COMITY. 6c>
</p>
<p>15 Mass. 35, 39, "is of universal operation, that none shall, by the
</p>
<p>aid of a court of justice obtain the fruits of an unlawful Ijargain."
</p>
<p>Contracts are illegal because of their tendency to promote un-
</p>
<p>lawful acts without regard to any circumstances which go to
</p>
<p>affect the probability of the unlawful act being done.' But it has
</p>
<p>been held that a contract, innocent in itself, will not be avoided
</p>
<p>because it may by possibility facilitate an illegal transaction; to
</p>
<p>render it void the connection with the illegal transaction must be
</p>
<p>direct and not remote or conjectural.*
</p>
<p>There is a distinction between a contract prohibited by law
</p>
<p>and one made by parties exercising a calling which is prohibited
</p>
<p>unless licensed, or one made in furtherance of an illegal business;'
</p>
<p>thus, an ordinance making it a misdemeanor for anyone to trans-
</p>
<p>act business as a house and real estate agent, without a license
</p>
<p>therefor, will not prevent the enforcement of a contract between
</p>
<p>an unlicensed agent and a vendor which has been executed by the
</p>
<p>former.*
</p>
<p> 10. The Local Policy or Statute Determines the Question
</p>
<p>of Enforcement of Foreign Contracts  State Comity.  The
</p>
<p>law of the contract, it is said, as a general proposition, travels with
</p>
<p>it, wherever the parties thereto are to be found, and into what-
</p>
<p>ever forum resort is had for its enforcement."
</p>
<p>In the absence of any agreement as to the law of a contract, the
</p>
<p>law of the place of performance controls.'
</p>
<p>And as a general rule, a debt or chose in action, being incor-
</p>
<p>poreal, is deemed to follow the person of the owner, and to be
</p>
<p>present with him; thus, a note dated and made payable at Boston^
</p>
<p>by a resident of that place in favor of a resident of l^ew York,
</p>
<p>in pursuance of an agreement made by the maker's agent in 'New
</p>
<p>York, is to be governed by the laws of New York.^

</p>
<p>The situB of a debt follows the creditor; and where the debtor
</p>
<p>and creditor reside in different states, the law of the doniicil of
</p>
<p>the creditor prevails.'
</p>
<p>But for some purposes the courts treat such property or inter-
</p>
<p>ests as having a situs at the place of the owner's domicil. It is
</p>
<p>so for the purposes of taxation, and in insolvency or other pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings by creditors."
</p>
<p>And this general rule always yields when the law and policy of
</p>
<p>the State where the property is actually located, have provided a
</p>
<p>different rule of transfer from that of the State where the owner
</p>
<p>lives. Thus the policy, as shown in a statute of a State, requir-
</p>
<p>ing a chattel mortgage upon any boat navigating the canals, to be
</p>
<p>filed in the office of the canal commissioner, where such mortgage
</p>
<p>is not accompanied by immediate delivery and followed by actual
</p>
<p>and continued change of possession, or declaring it void as against
</p>
<p>creditors of the mortgagor, cannot be made subject to the law of
</p>
<p>the domicil of the mortgagor residing in another State.* The
</p>
<p>residence of the attaching creditor in such case is held not ma-
</p>
<p>terial. The liability of property to be attached and sold under
</p>
<p>legal process, issuing from the courts of the State in which the
</p>
<p>property is actually situated, must be determined by the law of
</p>
<p>that State, rather than by the jurisdiction w^here the owner lives.*
</p>
<p>The fiction of law that the domicil of the owner draws to it his
</p>
<p>personal estate yields, whenever, for the purposes of state policy
</p>
<p>or justice, the actual situs of the property should be examined.*
</p>
<p>An assignment of personal property in Idaho, contrary to the
</p>
<p>laws of that Territory, and in accordance with the laws of Utah,
</p>
<p>where the assignor resides, will not be upheld against attaching
</p>
<p>creditors in Idaho.'
</p>
<p>Nor is this fiction of law ever adopted when it would contra-
</p>
<p>vene local criminal laws, or would sanction vice or immorality, or
</p>
<p>is against a positive prohibition of law.''

<p>LOCAL POLICY OK STATUTE  STATE COMITY. 87
</p>
<p>Contracts permissible in the locality where made, are nonen-
</p>
<p>f orceable elsewhere, if they contravene existing 'laws, or mles of
</p>
<p>morality or local policy.'
</p>
<p>The courtesy or comity of a State which gives to the laws of a
</p>
<p>foreign State an extra-territorial force, will not be exercised against
</p>
<p>positive statute or in opposition to the public policy of the State
</p>
<p>in which the court is acting. There are many considerations
</p>
<p>which seem to render it proper that the public policy of the State
</p>
<p>should be declared through its legislation rather than expressed
</p>
<p>through its courts; but in the absence of legislation, the duty
</p>
<p>doubtless devolves upon the court."
</p>
<p>No people are bound to hold valid in their courts of justice a
</p>
<p><3ontract which' is injurious to their public rights or offends their
</p>
<p>morals, or contravenes their policy, or violates public law, and
</p>
<p>every independent community will judge for itself how far the
</p>
<p>rule of comity between states is to be permitted to interfere with
</p>
<p>its domestic interests and policy.'

</p>
<p>is made or to be enforced, although not expressly prohibited hj
</p>
<p>law, cannot be enforced.*
</p>
<p>The general rule is that courts will enforce contracts valid by
</p>
<p>the law of the place where made, unless they are injurious to the
</p>
<p>interests of the State or of its citizens."
</p>
<p>The injury may be indirect by offending against justice or
</p>
<p>morality, or by tending to subvert settled public policy.'
</p>
<p>But tliis does not imply that courts will not sustain contracts
</p>
<p>that would not be valid if made within their jurisdiction, or will
</p>
<p>not enforce rights that could not be acquired there.
</p>
<p>A mere repugnancy of a contract to a statute designed appa-
</p>
<p>rently alone to raise revenue is not sufficient to prevent a recov-
</p>
<p>ery under the contract in another State.* Thus, for example, the
</p>
<p>courts of Pennsylvania have always enforced contracts for a
</p>
<p>higher rate of interest than would be valid under the laws of that
</p>
<p>State.'
</p>
<p>So a contract by the proprietor of a circus, with a railroad com-
</p>
<p>pany, for the transportation of his own cars, at a reduced i*ate,
</p>
<p>exempting the carrier from liability for the negligent acts of its
</p>
<p>employes, if valid under the laws of the State where it is made
</p>
<p>and is to be wholly performed, and in which the breach occurs, is
</p>
<p>enforceable in another State where such contract would be invalid
</p>
<p>under its laws, if made in its jurisdiction.'
</p>
<p>The principle has been directly applied in many cases to con-
</p>
<p>tracts made by common carriers.'' In England the same result
</p>
<p>has been reached. *

<p>benefit of creditors, if vaHd by the lex loci contractus^ it wonld be
</p>
<p>upheld everywhere. It would also be sustained against creditors,
</p>
<p>if valid where made, and not in contravention of the law of the
</p>
<p>j)lace where sought to be enforced, both as to property situated
</p>
<p>in the foreign jurisdiction and property within the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of the trial court.*
</p>
<p>An assignment for the benefit of creditors, if valid by the law of
</p>
<p>the place of domicil of assignor, will pass all his personal property
</p>
<p>wherever situated, unless restrained by some local law or state
</p>
<p>policy of the State where the property is situated.'
</p>
<p>A deed of trust made by a citizen of one State, of securities of
</p>
<p>foreign corporations, for the benefit of a citizen of another State,
</p>
<p>if valid by the law of the State where it was made and of the
</p>
<p>State where it is enjoyed, will not be held invalid because of tli&
</p>
<p>mere fact that the trustee is a corporation of a State where such
</p>
<p>trusts are invalid."
</p>
<p>A deed of trust executed in another State on property in Lou-
</p>
<p>isiana, to secure the payment of promissory notes, will be enforced
</p>
<p>as a conventional mortgage.*
</p>
<p>In Richardson v. Forepaugh, 7 Gray, 546, a Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>assignment was held valid in Massachusetts, against a citizen of
</p>
<p>the latter State who had purchased of a citizen of Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>after the assignment, an overdue note, though without notice of
</p>
<p>the assignment. Such assignments are sustained so far as affects
</p>
<p>property which was at the time in the jurisdiction where it was
</p>
<p>made ; and also as against all citizens of that jurisdiction, when

</p>
<p>In Burloch v. Taylor, 16 Pick. 335, an assignment of personal
</p>
<p>property by a debtor in New York, valid under the laws of that
</p>
<p>State, was sustained against a subsequent attachment by a citizen
</p>
<p>of !New York of property in Massachusetts, although the assign-
</p>
<p>ment would have been invalid if made in Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>The courts of a State will not sustain the claim of attaching
</p>
<p>creditors, not citizens of the State whose process is invoked, in
</p>
<p>preference to the claim of an assignee obtaining title under the
</p>
<p>laws of the State of the insolvent debtor.'
</p>
<p>An assignment executed in another State, will not always be
</p>
<p>enforced to the manifest injury of citizens of the State in which
</p>
<p>its enforcement is sought," and a receiver of an insolvent corpo-
</p>
<p>ration in the State where it was created cannot claim the proceeds
</p>
<p>of a policy of insurance on its property in another State, where
</p>
<p>the loss was made payable, as against an assignee for its creditors
</p>
<p>who has been appointed in the latter State.'
</p>
<p>The title acquired by an assignee for the benefit of creditors,
</p>
<p>although good as to the property assigned, is (as to assets in
</p>
<p>other states, whose policy it is not to recognize as against the
</p>
<p>claims of creditors of the assignee domiciled therein, the validity
</p>
<p>of general assignments with preferences) liable to be defeated by
</p>
<p>attachments sued out of the courts of such other states by cred-
</p>
<p>itors domiciled therein, to recover their debts out of such assets.*
</p>
<p>But when declared fraudulent or invalid at the place where the
</p>
<p>property is situated they will not be sustained even if valid in the
</p>
<p>State where made ; * or where a different law exists.'
</p>
<p>Clearly the courts of a State cannot be required to give effect
</p>
<p>to an assignment or transfer of property within it, or of debts due
</p>
<p>to its citizens, which is found to be contrary to the policy and

</p>
<p>encourage fraudulent contrivances to defeat the operation of local
</p>
<p>insolvent or collection laws/
</p>
<p>In Faulkner v. Jli/man, 2 New Eug. Rep. 181, 142 Mass. 53,
</p>
<p>it was held that a voluntary assignment in trust for creditors,
</p>
<p>made in New York, and valid there, is not valid in Massachusetts,
</p>
<p>against an attachment, if such an assignment is one which, if
</p>
<p>made between citizens of Massachusetts, would be inoperative for
</p>
<p>want of compliance with legal requisitions. If the suit had been
</p>
<p>brought by New York plaintiffs alone, it was conceded that they
</p>
<p>could not be heard to deny the validity of the assignment, because
</p>
<p>as citizens of New York they would be bound by its laws even in
</p>
<p>Massachusetts.'' If brought by Massachusetts creditors alone, it
</p>
<p>is equally true, as the assignment is not valid by the law of Mas-
</p>
<p>sachusetts, that the attachment would prevail. All the parties
</p>
<p>are necessarily compelled to join in the action, and the New York
</p>
<p>plaintiffs are under no. disability to sue in Massachusetts. The
</p>
<p>principle of comity, it was held, did not require the Massachusetts
</p>
<p>court to enforce the New York law, different from its own,
</p>
<p>against the just rights of its own citizens and to their prejudice,
</p>
<p>because if it failed to do so, the residents of New York would
</p>
<p>incidentally obtain a benefit which they could not otherwise. A
</p>
<p>Massachusetts court is not required to deny its own citizens their
</p>
<p>lawful rights for the sake of denying to residents of New York
</p>
<p>that which could be accorded them only by reason of respect
</p>
<p>for the laws of New York, if they had brought suit alone. Con-
</p>
<p>sidering that the other plaintiffs were residents of Massachusetts,
</p>
<p>the fact that some are residents of New York was not considered
</p>
<p>sufficient to place the Massachusetts court under a duty to enforce
</p>
<p>the New York law as to assignments.
</p>
<p>But the rule that contracts made out of the State, which con-
</p>
<p>travene the policy of the State, will be held void, does not make
</p>
<p>void an assignment for creditors merely because it does not have

<p>92 MALUM m SE AND MALUM PKOHIBITUM  FOREIGN STATUTE.
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the United States has shown a strong
</p>
<p>disposition to follow the ruling of a state court, in which the par-
</p>
<p>ties resided, where the conveyance for the benefit of creditors was
</p>
<p>executed and in which the bulk of the property is situated, sus-
</p>
<p>taining such conveyance, even in case of a conveyance of doubt-
</p>
<p>ful validity. Especially is this true where the instrument was
</p>
<p>executed with the general acquiescence of creditors, and its pur-
</p>
<p>pose is equality between them, and it was not challenged for
</p>
<p>years, and the trustee, on the faith of its validity, assumed large
</p>
<p>liabilities, and carried on business to an enormous extent, and the
</p>
<p>creditors accepted payment resulting therefrom. Indeed, where
</p>
<p>a debtor, having large and scattered properties, and being much
</p>
<p>embarrassed, transfers his property for the benefit of his creditors
</p>
<p>equally, equity requires that any creditor who is not satisfied with
</p>
<p>the provisions of such transfer shall act promptly in challenge
</p>
<p>thereof, or else be adjudged to have waived any right of challenge
</p>
<p>to the instrument.'

<p>cerning contracts of insurance, those being questions of general
</p>
<p>commercial law.'
</p>
<p>Upon the general principles and doctrines of common jurispru-
</p>
<p>dence, it is the duty of this com-t to form an independent judg-
</p>
<p>ment.''
</p>
<p>What constitutes a contract of carriage is not a question of local
</p>
<p>law upon which the decision of a state court must control. It is
</p>
<p>a matter of general law, ujDon which this court will exercise its
</p>
<p>own judgment.'
</p>
<p>The decision of the state court holding a contract invalid on
</p>
<p>grounds of public policy is not binding on the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>the United States.*
</p>
<p>If the decision of the existence of an alleged contract requires a
</p>
<p>construction of the State Constitutions and laws, this court is not
</p>
<p>necessarily governed by previous decisions of the state courts,
</p>
<p>except where they have been so firmly established as to constitute
</p>
<p>a rule of property.'
</p>
<p>Subsequent fluctuations in the construction of a Statute, by the
</p>
<p>courts of the originating State or country, though they may be
</p>
<p>entitled to great respect, are not within the meaning of the rule.*
</p>
<p>This principle applies with equal force to aU contracts which
</p>
<p>come within its jurisdiction.''
</p>
<p>In a recent case the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has ques-
</p>
<p>tioned this line of ruling.*
</p>
<p>Plaintifi, being the proprietor of a circus, made a special con-
</p>
<p>tract with defendant for the transportation of a number of his

<p>writing, among wliich was a stipulation that in consideration that

</p>
<p>of transportation," the plaintiff released the defendant from all
</p>
<p>liability for or on account of loss, damage or injury to any of the
</p>
<p>animals, property or things thus transported, " although such loss,
</p>
<p>damage or injury may be caused by the negligence of the (defend-
</p>
<p>ant), its agents or employes." Damage having occurred by the
</p>
<p>negligence of defendant, plaintiff brought this suit, and the sole
</p>
<p>question was whether it could be maintained in the face of the
</p>
<p>stipulation above set forth.
</p>
<p>The contract was made, was to be performed, and the alleged
</p>
<p>breach occurred m New York. No possible element was wanting,
</p>
<p>therefore, to make it a New York contract. It is admitted that
</p>
<p>in New York the stipulation is valid, and this action could not be
</p>
<p>maintained.'
</p>
<p>Why, then, it is asked, should plaintiff, by stepping across the
</p>
<p>boundary into Pennsylvania, acquire rights which he has not paid
</p>
<p>for, and his contract does not give him ?
</p>
<p>It is argued that the validity of this contract is a question of
</p>
<p>commercial law, and therefore the mere decisions of the New
</p>
<p>York courts are not bhiding, and in the absence of any statute in
</p>
<p>New York exjorcssly authorizing such a contract, the courts of
</p>
<p>this State must follow their own views of the commercial, as part
</p>
<p>of the general common law, though different views may be held
</p>
<p>as to such law by the courts of New York.
</p>
<p>As this argument is one which is frequently advanced, and
</p>
<p>affects a number of important questions, it is, the court announces,
</p>
<p>time to say plainly that it rests upon an utterly inadmissible and
</p>
<p>untenable basis. The court deny that there is such a thing as a
</p>
<p>general commercial or general common law, separate from and
</p>
<p>irrespective of a particular State or government whose authority
</p>
<p>makes it law. It is said that law is a rule prescribed by the
</p>
<p>sovereign power. By whom, it is asked, is a general commercial
</p>
<p>law prescribed, and what tribunal has authority or recognition to
</p>
<p>declare or enforce it outside of the local jurisdiction of the govern-

<p>ment it represents ? Even the law of nations, the widest reaching

</p>
<p>armed hand, the ultima ratio region. The so-called commercial
</p>
<p>law is likewise a law only in name. Upon many questions arising
</p>
<p>in the business dealings of men, the laws of modern civilized
</p>
<p>states are substantially the same, and it is therefore common to
</p>
<p>say that such is the commercial law, but, except as a convenient
</p>
<p>phrase, such general law does not exist. There must be a State,
</p>
<p>or government, of which every law can be predicated, and to
</p>
<p>whose authority it owes its existence as law. Without such sanc-
</p>
<p>tion it is not law at all ; with such sanction it is law without refer-
</p>
<p>ence to its origin or the concurrence of other states or i^eople.
</p>
<p>Such sanction it is the prerogative of the courts of each State
</p>
<p>itself to declare. Their jurisdiction is final and exclusive, and in
</p>
<p>this respect there is no distinction between statute and common
</p>
<p>law. It is universally conceded that, as to statutes, the decisions
</p>
<p>of the state courts are binding upon all other tribunals ; yet such
</p>
<p>decisions have no higher sanction than those upon the common
</p>
<p>law, for what the latter determine, equally with the former, is
</p>
<p>the law of the particular State.
</p>
<p>The law of a State consists, it is said, of the Constitution, treaties,
</p>
<p>and statutes of the United States, the Constitution and statutes of
</p>
<p>the State, and the common law, not of any or all other counties,
</p>
<p>but of that State. There is a common law of England, and a
</p>
<p>common law of the State mainly founded thereon, but with cer-
</p>
<p>tain differences, and the only tribunal competent to pass authori-
</p>
<p>tatively on such differences is the state court. This familar
</p>
<p>illustration is used. In the United States the universal doctrine
</p>
<p>has always been that the English colonists brought vdth them,
</p>
<p>and made part of their laws, all the common law of England that
</p>
<p>was not un suited to their new situation. No part of the common
</p>
<p>law of Enorland is better settled than the doctrine of ancient
</p>
<p>hghts. The Court of Chancery of New Jersey, in Robeson v.
</p>
<p>Pittenger, 2 N. J. Eq. 57 (183S), held that the same doctrine was
</p>
<p>part of the common law of New Jersey. The Supreme Court of

<p>but because it is or is not the law of the respective states. And,

</p>
<p>It is insisted the so-called commercial law derives all its
</p>
<p>force from its adoption as part of the common law, and a decision
</p>
<p>on the commercial law of a State stands upon precisely the same
</p>
<p>basis as a decision upon any other branch of the common law, and
</p>
<p>that the only ground upon which any foreign tribunal can ques-
</p>
<p>tion either, is that it does not agree with the premises or the rea-
</p>
<p>soning of the court. But the same ground, it is argued, would
</p>
<p>enable it to question a decision upon a statute because a different
</p>
<p>construction seemed to it nearer the true intent of the legislative
</p>
<p>language, and this it is universally, conceded no foreign court can
</p>
<p>do. There is no difference, it is claimed, in principle. The decis-
</p>
<p>ions of a state cburt upon its common law and on its statutes
</p>
<p>must therefore, it is said, stand unquestioned, because it is the only
</p>
<p>authority competent to decide, or they must be alike questionable
</p>
<p>by any tribunal which may choose to differ with its reasons or its
</p>
<p>conclusions. Mitchell, e/., who pronounced the opinion, declares
</p>
<p>that it is not probable that the doctrine of such a distinction
</p>
<p>would ever have got a foothold in jurisprudence, and it would
</p>
<p>certainly have been long ago abandoned, had it not been for what
</p>
<p>he calls the unfortunate misstep that was made in the opinion in
</p>
<p>Swift V. Tyson, 41 U. S. 16 Pet. 1, 10 L. ed. 865. Since then
</p>
<p>the courts of the United States have, he says, persisted in the
</p>
<p>recognition of a mythical commercial law, and have professed to
</p>
<p>decide so-called commercial questions by it in entire disregard of

<p>the law of the State where the question arose. To the proposition
</p>
<p>tliat as to such questions the state courts also have similiar liberty,
</p>
<p>he replies that it would be sufficient answer that such a course, by
</p>
<p>reading into a contract a new duty not in contemplation of the
</p>
<p>parties, and not part of it by the law of the place where it is

</p>
<p>made, is in principle and in practical effect impairing the obliga-
</p>
<p>tion of the contract, which even the sovereign power of a State
</p>
<p>is prohibited from doing. But he rests the decision on the
</p>
<p>broader ground that the doctrine itself is unsound.
</p>
<p>It is asserted that the best professional opinion has long regarded
</p>
<p>it as indefensible on principle, and is thus verj recently summed
</p>
<p>up by the opinion of Stytes, " one of the most learned of living
</p>
<p>jurists " : " Questions growing out of contracts made and to be
</p>
<p>performed in a State are decided by the national court of last
</p>
<p>resort, not in accordance with the customary or unwritten law of
</p>
<p>the State where they orignated, as exj)Ounded by its courts, but
</p>
<p>agreeably to some theoretic view of a general commercial law,
</p>
<p>which does not exist, and is not to be found in the books. The
</p>
<p>state courts, on the other hand, adhere to their own precedents,
</p>
<p>and do not consider themselves entitled to impair the obligation
</p>
<p>of contracts that have been made in reliance on the principles
</p>
<p>which they have laid down through a long series of years. The
</p>
<p>result is a conflict of jurisdiction which there are no means of
</p>
<p>allaying. . . . Whether a recovery shall be had on a promis-
</p>
<p>sory note, which has been taken as collateral security for an ante-
</p>
<p>cedent debt against a maker, from whom it was obtained by fraud,
</p>
<p>is thus made to turn in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, not
</p>
<p>on any settled rule, but on the tribunal by which the cause is
</p>
<p>lieard; and if that is federal, the plaintiff will prevail; if it is local,
</p>
<p>the defendant. Such a result tends to discredit the law. . . .
</p>
<p>The enumeration might be carried further, but enough has, per-
</p>
<p>haps, been said to show that no uniform rule can be deduced from
</p>
<p>the decisions of the English and American courts under the com-
</p>
<p>mercial law, and that the certainty requisite to justice can be
</p>
<p>obtained only by following the local tribunals as regards the con-
</p>
<p>tracts made in each locality.

<p>gress short of an amendment of the Constitution. Had the New
</p>
<p>York Legislature declared that notes made and negotiated in that
</p>
<p>State should follow tlie rule laid down in Coddington v, Bay^ 20
</p>
<p>Johns. 637, the federal tribunals would have been bound to carry
</p>
<p>it into effect, notwithstanding any attempt of the national Legis-
</p>
<p>lature to introduce a different principle; and it is inconceivable
</p>
<p>that the judicial department of the government can exercise a
</p>
<p>greater authority in this respect than the legislative." '
</p>
<p>The opinion concludes that the distinction recognized by the
</p>
<p>federal court between the binding effect of decisions on commer-
</p>
<p>cial law, and on statutes, is utterly untenable; that the law declared
</p>
<p>by state courts to govern on contracts made within their jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion is conclusive everywhere; and the departure made by the
</p>
<p>United States courts is to be regretted and certainly not to be
</p>
<p>followed.
</p>
<p>In entire accordance with this view, are, it is insisted, the Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania cases of Brown v. Camden c& A. H. Co. 83 Pa. 316, and

</p>
<p>manner of its execution, cannot be affected by the laws or policy
</p>
<p>of other states. If no cause of action arose to the plaintiff under
</p>
<p>his contract when the accident occurred, the transaction cannot be
</p>
<p>converted into a cause of action by the fact that the parties have
</p>
<p>subsequently come within the jurisdiction of Ohio.
</p>
<p>The result of the decision is that as the validity of the contract
</p>
<p>is to be determined by the law of l^ew York, as decided by the
</p>
<p>courts of that State, there is no reason why the courts of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania should not enforce it, for the general rule is, that courts
</p>
<p>will enforce contracts valid by the law of the place where made,
</p>
<p>unless they are injm-ious to the State, or to its citizens.*
</p>
<p>The contract in question, it is said, does not directly affect the
</p>
<p>State or its citizens in any way, nor is it in any way contrary to
</p>
<p>justice or morality. It is even doubted whether it is so far con-
</p>
<p>trary to the policy of the State that it would have been invalid if it
</p>
<p>had been made in Pennsylvania. It is admitted that it had some
</p>
<p>exceptional features, which, it might be argued, take it out of the
</p>
<p>ordinary rule governing the contracts of common carriers, and the
</p>
<p>case of Coicp v. Wabash, St. L. da I*. R. Co., 56 Mich, 111, is a
</p>
<p>strong authority for that position. But without stopping to dis-
</p>
<p>cuss that point, which the general view adopted renders unneces-
</p>
<p>sary, it was considered sufficient to say that even if it would not
</p>
<p>have been vahd if made in Pennsylvania, its enforcement as a
</p>
<p>New York contract does not in any way derogate from the laws
</p>
<p>of Penusylvania, or injure or affect the policy of the State, any
</p>
<p>more than would a foreign contract for what would be usurious
</p>
<p>in Pennsylvania, and that the courts have never hesitated to en-
</p>
<p>force.
</p>
<p>So far as the decision can be considered as yielding state policy
</p>
<p>to comity, if it can be so regarded, while the opinion expressly
</p>
<p>disclaims such a concession, its force is weakened by the fact that
</p>
<p>Paxson, Ch. J., and Clark, J., were absent, and Sterrett united in
</p>
<p>the following dissent of Williams, J.: " I dissent from the judg-

<p>ment in this case because I cannot agree that a well settled rule of
</p>
<p>public policy of this Commonwealth must give way to considera-

<p>tions of mere comity. The contract set up as a defense to this

<p>action is a release to a common carrier from liability for its own

</p>
<p>negligence. It is well settled in this State that such a release is
</p>
<p>against public policy. Comity does not require more of us than
</p>
<p>to eive effect to the lex loci contractus when not subversive of the
</p>
<p>public policy of our own State. This has been distinctly held by the
</p>
<p>Court of Appeals of Kew York,* in which this release was exe-
</p>
<p>cuted, and in whose behalf comity is asked. I would follow the
</p>
<p>Court of Appeals, because comity can require no more of us in
</p>
<p>any given case than the courts of the place of the contract would
</p>
<p>yield to us for comity's sake; and because I believe the rule to
</p>
<p>rest on solid ground."

<p>a. May be Given to Alien Enemy.  License may be granted

<p>with the enemy, except by license, subjects the property to confis-

<p>b. Liberally Construed.  Where a license is issued even to

<p>A license of this nature, legalizing a particular venture, inci-

</p>
<p>(Dana, Wheat.  317), and Phillimore (vol. 5, 109). Such also is
</p>
<p>the rule of the common law.'
</p>
<p>A distinction was taken in Bell v. Gilson, 1 Bos. & P. 345,
</p>
<p>where it was held that the insurance of goods purchased in an
</p>
<p>enemy's country during war, by a British agent, and shipped for
</p>
<p>British subjects, was lawful insurance. But in Furtado v. Rogers,
</p>
<p>3 Bos. & P. 191, every distinction of that kind was abandoned^
</p>
<p>and in case of French property, previous to war, insurance was
</p>
<p>held not to cover a loss by British capture after the war was
</p>
<p>renewed, even though the action was not brought until after
</p>
<p>peace was declared.* The ordinances of Barcelona, as early as
</p>
<p>1484, declared such insurance void.*
</p>
<p>Bynkershoek, discussing this question, concludes that the very
</p>
<p>fact and reason of the existence of war absolutely forbids the
</p>
<p>insurance of enemy's property, because by assuming such risks,
</p>
<p>we promote the maritime commerce of the enemy. Valin consid-
</p>
<p>ered that insuring enemy's property and trading with the enemy

<p>was substantially the same thing.* As to how far a foreign domicil
</p>
<p>communicates to a citizen the disabilities of an alien enemy, see
</p>
<p>1 Kent, Com.  4.
</p>
<p>Such contracts are not only illegal and void, but repugnant to
</p>
<p>every principle of public policy. The law will not permit one
</p>
<p>under the obligations of patriotic duty, to subject himself to such
</p>
<p>a temptation to disloyalty. A subject in time of war, cannot with-
</p>
<p>out license from his government, bring home even in a neutral
</p>
<p>vessel, goods purchased in the enemy's port after the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of hostilities.*
</p>
<p>A policy of insurance entered into in the name of a British sub-
</p>
<p>ject, as trustee for the persons interested, though the property
</p>
<p>insured is of British manufacture and exported from that country,
</p>
<p>cannot be enforced under the law of England.' Even if the con-
</p>
<p>tracting parties are ignorant, at the time of entering into the
</p>
<p>contract, of the existence of the war, the rule is the same.* Al-
</p>
<p>though the war breaks out after the effecting of the policy and
</p>
<p>after the commencement of the risk, yet in no instance can the
</p>
<p>policy be enforced, or the interest insured be protected while it
</p>
<p>remains impressed with the character of hostility.*

</p>
<p>Personal influence to be exercised over an officer of the govern-

</p>
<p>A contract which contemplates the use of personal influence or
</p>

<p>the citj is void as against public policy.''
</p>

<p>the street commissioners, and advocate the laying out of a street
</p>
<p>through land of the promisor, and to get as much as he can as
</p>
<p>damages therefor, is not against public policy, but it is a valid
</p>
<p>contract, which will not be invalidated by evidence tending to show
</p>
<p>the subsequent use by the lawyer of his personal influence as
</p>
<p>chairman of the city committee of a pohtical party in fulfilling
</p>
<p>his part of the contract.^
</p>
<p>An agreement to induce a public officer to do an illegal act or
</p>
<p>to neglect his duty is void.*
</p>
<p>Where a city officer corruptly agrees with another person that
</p>
<p>the latter shall buy certain property selected by a board of which
</p>
<p>the officer is a member as suitable for a certain public purpose,
</p>
<p>and that the officer shall use his influence to induce the board to
</p>
<p>purchase it from the other at an advanced price, the profits to be
</p>
<p>divided between them; and the fraud is consummated by means
</p>
<p>of the information given by the officer and his influence with the

<p>An agreement for compensation, to procure a contract from the
</p>
<p>government to furnish its supphes, cannot be enforced by the

<p>courts, it being against public poHcy,'
</p>
<p>A contract by a municipal corporation to pay a public oflBcer a

<p>percentage compensation, in addition to, or instead of that pre-
</p>
<p>scribed by law, is against public policy and void." But a contract

<p>A promissory note given by a defaulting outgoing county treas-

</p>
<p>Every citizen has a right of access to the official records and to

</p>
<p>The right to sell and dispose of property is an essential element
</p>
<p>of ownership. The appearance of a party before the heads of
</p>
<p>departments for such purpose, in person or by agent, is proper and
</p>
<p>necessary for the administration of the government. Government
</p>
<p>property cannot, in any other way, be leased, bought or sold.'
</p>
<p>The rule is that the law will not presume a contract void as against
</p>
<p>public policy if it is capable of a construction making it valid,"
</p>
<p>A promissory note payable on condition that the payee shall
</p>
<p>erect a building at a point designated in a city and that the build-
</p>
<p>ing, as designated, shall be occupied as a post-office, where the
</p>
<p>court found the contract was a valid one and for a valuable con-
</p>
<p>sideration without fraud on the part of the payee, and that it was
</p>
<p>not in contravention of any law or contrary to public policy, and
</p>
<p>that, in seeking the post-office to be located in the building, the
</p>
<p>payee used no undue influence upon any departments or officer of
</p>
<p>the government, and was not guilty of any corruption or corrupt
</p>
<p>practice in making such contract,  was sustained as a valid con-
</p>
<p>tract.*
</p>
<p>But a contract to pay a certain sum to induce the retention of
</p>
<p>a postoffice at a given point for individual or private benefit or
</p>
<p>gain is said to be against public policy."
</p>
<p>Contracts for the location of a county-seat are not void as against
</p>
<p>public policy because individuals directly interested held out
</p>
<p>inducements, by way of donations of land or money, to influence
</p>
<p>the action of those charged with the duty of making the selec-
</p>
<p>tion.'
</p>
<p>Though an agreement to indemnify an officer for doing an
</p>
<p>unlawful act, or contract to indemnify an officer for neglecting his
</p>
<p>duty, is void,' yet a bond to save an officer harmless for an unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful act already done is valid.'

<p>it, is legitimate, where it involves the presentation before a com-

<p>may be fairly sustained, yet an attempt to secure legislative action

<p>funds and generally perform all the duties of the office, his suc-
</p>
<p>cessor merely to sign the official reports and be treasurer merelj
</p>
<p>in name, such contract is void as against public policy.'
</p>
<p>It has been held that there is no difference in principle between
</p>
<p>the sale of an office for a valuable consideration and the disposing
</p>
<p>of it to the person who will perform its duties for the lowest com-
</p>
<p>pensation.'
</p>
<p>To permit a candidate, in order to influence the voters, to bold
</p>
<p>out a promise that he will serve, in case of election, for less than
</p>
<p>the fees or salary fixed by law, is to thwart the will of the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, and to defeat the object of the law. It is unjust to honest
</p>
<p>aspirants who rely upon their merits for political preferment, and
</p>
<p>tends to degrade the public service by making the offices not the
</p>
<p>reward of official capacity and honoral)le conduct, but the prey of
</p>
<p>those who by reason of incapacity to earn a livelihood in the com-
</p>
<p>mon pursuits of life are willing to undertake the duties of public
</p>
<p>service for a less sum than the Legislature has deemed an ade-
</p>
<p>quate compensation for the work. It puts up the offices of the
</p>
<p>State to the lowest bidder and conduces to influence the voters to
</p>
<p>lose sight of the personal fitness of the respective candidates and
</p>
<p>to be governed by considerations of a false economy."
</p>
<p>It may be that an offer by a candidate for county clerk to remit,
</p>
<p>in case of his election, his fees for ex officio services, should be
</p>
<p>deemed an offer to contribute to each taxpayer his proportion of
</p>
<p>the taxes necessary to raise the sum so remitted.
</p>
<p>In Carrothers v. Riissell, 53 Iowa, 346, 36 Am. Eep. 222, the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Iowa held such a promise virtually an offer to
</p>
<p>bribe the voters. But it does not follow that, in the absence of
</p>
<p>some constitutional or statutory provision, a candidate who has
</p>
<p>made such promise and has received the highest number of votes
</p>
<p>and has taken the required oath can be removed from office by
</p>
<p>the mere proof of the fact in the proceeding in which he is sought
</p>
<p>to be ousted.

<p>ing upon the qnestion. The Constitution of Kentucky reqnire&
</p>
<p>every person before accepting office to take an oath that he has
</p>
<p>not fonght a duel or sent or accepted a cliallonge to tight a duel.
</p>
<p>That Constitution also contained the furtlier provision which de-
</p>
<p>clared that anyone who had fought a duel or sent or accepted a
</p>
<p>challenge should be disqualified from holding office. In the case
</p>
<p>cited it was held that a party who liad been elected to an office and
</p>
<p>had qualified by taking the prescribed oath could not be deprived
</p>
<p>of his office until he had been legally convicted of the offense of
</p>
<p>having sent a challenge, in a pro])er criminal proceeding, upon an
</p>
<p>indictment charging him with that olfense.
</p>
<p>In Greenhood on Public Policy (p. 341) it is said : "So far lias
</p>
<p>the doctrine, which prohibits anything which might influence the'
</p>
<p>selection of public officers from other considerations than that of
</p>
<p>personal merit, been carried, that an election secured by a promise
</p>
<p>on the part of a candidate to perform the duties of the office to
</p>
<p>which he aspires, if elected, for less than the legal fees or salary)
</p>
<p>is void." The same doctrine is recognized in McCrary on Elections
</p>
<p>(3d ed.)  181. If the authors mean to assert that an election so
</p>
<p>procured is void, without reference to the question whetiier or not
</p>
<p>a sufficient number of voters were induced by the promise, to
</p>
<p>vote for the successful candidate, to have changed the result, they
</p>
<p>are not supported by the authorities which they cite.
</p>
<p>In Ccwrothers v. Russell, 53 Iowa, 346, the Iowa court held
</p>
<p>that a promise by a candidate to pay into the treasury, if elected,
</p>
<p>all the fees of his office in excess of $1,000, rendered him inehgi-
</p>
<p>ble; but the decision is expressly based upon the provisions of a
</p>
<p>statute of that State.
</p>
<p>In State v. Pitrchj, 36 Wis. 213, 17 Am. Rep. 485, it was de-
</p>
<p>cided, merely, that the votes which were procured by a similar
</p>
<p>promise should be rejected. To the same effect was State v. Olin,
</p>
<p>23 Wis. 327.
</p>
<p>In State v. Collier, 72 Mo. 13, 37 Am. Rep. 417, the informa-

<p>tion charged that a like promise had been made and that a suffi-
</p>
<p>cient number of votes had been influenced thereby to change the
</p>
<p>result. The court held that a demurrer to the information was
</p>
<p>improperly sustained; but it did not hold either that the election
</p>
<p>was void or that the candidate was disqualified.

<p>CONTRACTS OBSTKUCTING PUBLIC JUSTICE. 115
</p>
<p>In Tucker v. Aiken .. 7 N. H. 113, tlie selectmen of a town had
</p>
<p>put up the office of collector of taxes to the lowest bidder, and
</p>
<p>his right to the office was collaterally brought into question in the
</p>
<p>suit. It was held that the question could not be determined in a
</p>
<p>collateral proceeding.
</p>
<p>In Hall V. Gavitt, 18 Ind. 390, it was decided that the sale bj
</p>
<p>a sheriff of the office of deputy was void; and that a bond given
</p>
<p>as a part of the bargain by the deputy to the sheriff for the faith-
</p>
<p>ful performance of his duties was also void.
</p>
<p>There are some other cases which might be cited, but these
</p>
<p>approach most nearly the question; and it is clear tliat none of
</p>
<p>them bold that an election procured by such a promise is void, or
</p>
<p>that, in the absence of a written law so declaring, the incuml^ent
</p>
<p>so elected can be ousted for that reason alone.
</p>
<p>It has however been held that proof that a candidate for the
</p>
<p>nomination of county commissioner in Pennsylvania violated the
</p>
<p>statute of that State, enacted to prevent fraud at nominating elec-
</p>
<p>tions, is, under the Constitution disqualifying such person from
</p>
<p>holding office, sutHcient, after his election, to oust him from the
</p>
<p>office.'
</p>
<p>Where it was proved that a candidate for Parliament promised
</p>
<p>money to voters to induce them to vote, the indictment, though
</p>
<p>bad for uncertainty, was cured by the verdict of guilty."

</p>
<p>In general it is to the interest of the public that the discontinu-
</p>
<p>ance of a prosecution, for an offense which seriously affected the
</p>
<p>public, whether a felony or a misdemeanor, should not be made
</p>
<p>matter of private bargain; and hence the suppression or settlement

</p>
<p>ment to obstruct the course of justice by procuring the release

</p>
<p>A contract made by a justice of the peace with a litigant in his
</p>
<p>court, that such litigant should not be required to pay any fees or
</p>
<p>costs therein unless procured from the adverse party, is contrary
</p>
<p>to public policy and void."
</p>
<p>A contract to pay for the postponement of the execution of a

</p>
<p>Although a witness is beyond the process of the court, yet his
</p>
<p>attendance cannot be induced by a promise to pay a compensation

</p>
<p>A defendant in a partition suit must make known to the court
</p>
<p>and to his co-defendants any fact within his knowledge which
</p>
<p>will prevent a cuntirmation of the sale; hence an agreement by

<p>him, with knowledge that the property was sold for less than its
</p>
<p>real value, to refrain from objecting to the confirmation of the
</p>
<p>sale in consideration of the payment to him of an additional sum

<p>for his interest in the property, is a fraud upon the court and his

<p>It was a promise to pay a consideration for the concealment of

</p>
<p>Champerty is a species of maintenance, which at common law
</p>
<p>was an indictable offense. Maintenance was an officious inter-
</p>
<p>meddling in a lawsuit by a mere stranger without protit." Cham-
</p>
<p>perty involved the element of compensation for such unlawful
</p>
<p>interference by bargain for part of the matter in suit, or some
</p>
<p>profit growing out of it, or, according to some of the authors, as
</p>
<p>well also for the whole of the thing in dispute.'
</p>
<p>It would accomplish no good to quote at length the numberless
</p>
<p><letinitions of these offenses given in the old books. "It appear-
</p>
<p><!th that the end of champerty and maintenance is to suppress jus-
</p>
<p>tice and trutli, or at least to work delay, and therefore it i^malum,
</p>
<p>in se and ao^ainst the common law.'' * It existed before the Stat-
</p>
<p>utes of West 1, chap. 25.'
</p>
<p>Sir James Stephen, in his Digest of Criminal Law (note 8),
</p>
<p>jilludes to the vasrueness with which these crimes are defined bv
</p>
<p>the ancient common law writers, and discusses the reasons why
</p>
<p>they have long since become obsolete.
</p>
<p>The ground of their origin is found in the familiar principle
</p>
<p>stated by Lord Coke: "Nothing,"' he says, "in action, entry or
</p>
<p>i-e-entry, can be granted over; for so, under color thereof, pre-
</p>
<p>tended titles might be granted to great men, whereby right might
</p>
<p>be trodden down and the weak oppressed." '
</p>
<p>It was a part of the law of maintenance that no chose in action,
</p>
<p>which included all rights not reduced to possession, could be
</p>
<p>assigned or transferred. This was on the ground, as said by Mr.

<p>'Chittv, that " such alienations tended to increase maintenance and
</p>
<p>litigation, and afforded means to powerful men to purchase rights
</p>
<p>of action, and thereby enable them to oppress indigent debtors,
</p>
<p>whose original creditors would not, perhaps, have sued them." *
</p>
<p>It is common knowledge, however, that this rule, refusing to
</p>
<p>sanction or give effect to the assignment of choses in action, was
</p>
<p>never adopted by courts of equity, either in England or in this
</p>
<p>country, and that courts of law, yielding to the growing exactions
</p>
<p>of commerce, finally allowed the assignees of such rights to main-
</p>
<p>tain suits in the name of their assignors.'
</p>
<p>The peculiar state of society out of which such a law grew car-
</p>
<p>ried it to the most absurd extremes. Men were held indictable
</p>
<p>for aiding a litigant to find a lawyer; forgiving friendly advice to
</p>
<p>a neighbor as to his legal rights; for lending money to a friend to
</p>
<p>vindicate his known legal rights; for offering voluntarily to testify
</p>
<p>in a pending suit; and otlier like offices of charity and friendship.'
</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the law on this subject has
</p>
<p>gradually undergone a great change, which is recognized univers-
</p>
<p>^Uy.by jurists, judges and law writers everywhere; though in some
</p>
<p>of the states the change is scarcely recognized as it should be by
</p>
<p>the courts, in others this modification is acknowledged.'' It has
</p>
<p>been greatly modified in Massachusetts and New York, even be-
</p>
<p>yond the active aid of legislation.* After adverse possession of

<p>by tlie landlord is void for champerty.' In other states it has
</p>
<p>been entirely repudiated."
</p>
<p>This change has been called for by the new conditions of mod-
</p>
<p>ern society, considered in its varied relations, commercial, politi-
</p>
<p>cal and sociological. In many of its phases it has been, both in
</p>
<p>America and England, emphatically discarded as " inapplicable to
</p>
<p>the present condition of society, and obsolete."" *
</p>
<p>It is accordingly asserted on high English authority that no one
</p>
<p>has been punished criminally for the olfense of maintenance or
</p>
<p>champerty within the memory of living man.*
</p>
<p>Public opinion in England has advanced so far on this subject
</p>
<p>that the criminal law commissioners many years ago recommended
</p>
<p>very earnestly that the otfenses of maintenance and champerty be
</p>
<p>abolished, observing of them that they " are relics of an age when
</p>
<p>courts of justice were liable to intimidation by the rich and power-
</p>
<p>ful and their dependents."* *
</p>
<p>There is much reason, it thus seems, for the relaxation of the
</p>
<p>old doctrines pertaining to this subject, so that they may be
</p>
<p>adapted to the new order of things in the present highly progres-
</p>
<p>sive and commercial age. Necessity and justice have, accordingly,
</p>
<p>forced the establishment of recognized exceptions to the doctrine
</p>
<p>of these offenses. Among these may be enumerated the following
</p>
<p>instances: relationship by blood or marriage will often now justify
</p>
<p>parties in giving each other assistance in lawsuits; ' and the rela-
</p>
<p>tion of attorney and client; or the extension of charitable aid to
</p>
<p>the poor and oppressed litigant; ' and especially is an interference
</p>
<p>in a lawsuit excusable when it is by one who has, or honestly be-
</p>
<p>lieves he has, a valuable interest in its prosecution.

</p>
<p>The principle is thus generally stated: " It has been seen that
</p>
<p>tlie gist of the offense of maintenance is that the interference is
</p>
<p>officious. Where, therefore, a party either has, or honestly
</p>
<p>believes he has, an interest, either in the subject matter of the lit-
</p>
<p>iication or in the question to be determined, he may assist in the
</p>
<p>prosecution or defense of the suit, either by furnishing counsel or
</p>
<p>contributing to the expenses, and may, in order to strengthen his
</p>
<p>position, purchase the interest of another party in addition to his
</p>
<p>own. The interest may be either small or great, certain or uncer-
</p>
<p>tain, vested or contingent; but it is essential that it be distinct
</p>
<p>from what he may acquire from the party maintained."
</p>
<p>The purchase of railroad bonds from foreclosing bondholders,
</p>
<p>pending a suit involving the sale of the railroad, in pursuance of
</p>
<p>a purpose to obtain a lease of the road to tiie purchaser and his
</p>
<p>associates, who desired it to form a connection with a road already
</p>
<p>owned by them; and an agreement by the purchaser to pay all
</p>
<p>expenses of the i)ending litigation, although the bonds were not ta
</p>
<p>be delivered until its termination.  are not void for champerty
</p>
<p>because of the purchaser's interest in the result of the suit.*
</p>
<p>A sale of his claim by one who performs labor and furnishes
</p>
<p>materials for the construction of a gravel road is not champertous.*
</p>
<p>In Thompson v. Marshall, 36 Ala. 5()4, this principle was
</p>
<p>applied to a case where one co-defendant, in a suit pending to
</p>
<p>rescind a conveyance for fraud, purchased the interest of such co-
</p>
<p>defendant in the property in litigation, and assmned a liability for
</p>
<p>his vendors share of the costs and expenses of suit. The contract of
</p>
<p>purchase was held not to be champertous, because the interference
</p>
<p>was to protect a valuable interest, and was not, therefore, either
</p>
<p>an unlawful or officious intermeddling.
</p>
<p>So in McCall v. Copehart, 20 Ala. 521, where certain persons,,
</p>
<p>erroneously believing that they had an interest in a piece of land
</p>
<p>then in litigation, purchased the interest of the defendant, and

<p>indemnified him against the cost and damages of suit, the court

</p>
<p>the honest behef that they were interested in the result of the
</p>
<p>suit, and not for tlie purpose of fomenting litigation."
</p>
<p>The modern and better definitions of '' champerty " incorporate
</p>
<p>this idea fully. Mr. Wharton says: "Maintenance is support
</p>
<p>given to a litigant in any legal proceeding in which the person
</p>
<p>giving the assistance has no valuable interest, or in which he assists
</p>
<p>from any improper motive.'"
</p>
<p>In 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary (l-tth ed.) 90, it is defined to be
</p>
<p>"a malicious, or, at least, officious, interference in a suit in which
</p>
<p>tlie offender has no interest, to assist one of the parties to it against
</p>
<p>the other with money or advice to prosecute or defend the action
</p>
<p>without any authority of law."
</p>
<p>So Mr. Addison involves in the definition the idea of agreeing
</p>
<p>to assist in the prosecution of a lawsuit, " in which the party mak-
</p>
<p>ing the agreement is in no wise interested, and with which he has
</p>
<p>no just or reasonable ground for interference.'"
</p>
<p>Of course it is necessarily true that, if the offense in question
</p>
<p>does not amount to maintenance, there can be no champerty in it,
</p>
<p>because champerty is but a species of maintenance."
</p>
<p>In ThaUhiiner v. Brinckerhoff, 3 Cow. 623, a leading and learned
</p>
<p>case on the subject of champerty, it is said "that any interest
</p>
<p>whatever in tlie subject of the suit is sufficient to exempt him who
</p>
<p>^ives aid to the suitor from the charge of illegal maintenance."
</p>
<p>And referring to such interferences it is said: "Upon all such
</p>
<p>cases these laws w^ere never intended to operate. They were
</p>
<p>intended to prevent the interference of strangers having no pre-
</p>
<p>tense of right to the subject of the suit, and standing in no rela-
</p>
<p>tion of duty to the suitor. They were intended to prevent traffic
</p>
<p>in doubtful claims, and to operate upon buyers of pretended rights,
</p>
<p>who had no relation to the suitor or the subject, otherwise than
</p>
<p>as purchasers of the profits of litigation."

<p>that attorneys may lawfully contract with their clients to prose-
</p>
<p>cute claims agahist the United States and receive compensation
</p>
<p>therefor conditioned upon their success, either as fees or agreed

</p>
<p>of professional services on the part of the assignee, assigned to his
</p>
<p>attorney the entire property in litigation, gi^ing him the entire
</p>
<p>management and control of the suit, and stipulating for his own
</p>
<p>(the assignor's) active prosecution of it. It was said by Brickell,
</p>
<p>Ch. J.:
</p>
<p>"The corrupting element of the contract [of champerty] is its
</p>
<p>tendency to foment or protract litigation, its dependency for
</p>
<p>its value upon the termination of suits, and its introduction, to
</p>
<p>control and manage thejn, of parties without other right or inter-
</p>
<p>est than such as is derived from the contract." On this ground
</p>
<p>the sale of land pendente lite, or by one out of possession is for-
</p>
<p>bidden." But that litigation may be in certain possible circum-
</p>
<p>stances required to perfect the title will not make the deed void.*
</p>
<p>As between the parties such conveyances are generally held as
</p>
<p>estoppels.*

<p>124 PRIVATK CONTRACTS AND CIVIL GOVERNMENTS.
</p>
<p>hi Call V. Calef, 13 Met. 362, wliere two persons owned dis-
</p>
<p>tinct riglits to the exclusive use of a patent in two different
</p>
<p>places, near each other, it was held that the interest which each
</p>
<p>had in maintaining the value and profit of his particular right
</p>
<p>would justify him in aiding the other to prosecute a suit for the
</p>
<p>infringement of the exclusive right of the latter. So it has been
</p>
<p>held, and is manifest, that any citizen may lawfully contribute to
</p>
<p>the lawful expenses of any public criminal prosecution, and the
</p>
<p>act will not subject him to the charge of maintenance.'
</p>
<p>It may safely be said that the whole doctrine of maintenance
</p>
<p>has been modified in recent times so as to confine it to strangers
</p>
<p>who, having no valuable interest in a suit, pragmatically interfere
</p>
<p>in it for the improper purpose of stirring up litigation and strife,
</p>
<p>and champerty, which is a species of maintenance attended with
</p>
<p>a bargain for a part or the whole of the thing in dispute, does not
</p>
<p>exist in the absence of this characteristic of maintenance. If the
</p>
<p>pecuniary interest of a person, even though he own no part of
</p>
<p>the immediate subject matter of the suit, be so connected with it
</p>
<p>collaterally in any way as to be diminished or increased in value
</p>
<p>by the result of such suit, there is no principle of public policy
</p>
<p>that ought to forbid such person from taking proper care that
</p>
<p>such interest shall be properly protected in the courts.
</p>
<p>The forfeiture of a charter of a railroad, for example, on the
</p>
<p>line of which the owner of a factory or rolling mill may have his
</p>
<p>plant, might result in his financial ruin. Could it be said, in the
</p>
<p>light of modern views on this subject, that an agreement to aid in
</p>
<p>preventing the forfeiture would be champertous, and as such
</p>
<p>criminal, because the mill owner held no stock in the railroad
</p>
<p>company, nor was otherwise immediately interested in the corpor-
</p>
<p>ate charter or property ? Interference in lawsuits, it has been
</p>
<p>said, to savor of maintenance, must have some "tendency to per-
</p>
<p>vert the course of justice;" * or else, as said by Blackstone, " to
</p>
<p>pervert the remedial process of the law into an engine of oppress-

<p>CONTRACTS OBSTRLCTING PUBLIC JUSTICE. 125
</p>
<p>These elements of unlawfulness are entirely wanting in the sup-
</p>
<p>posed case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stoiy asserts that one " may purchase by assignment the
</p>
<p>whole interest of another in a contract or security or other prop-
</p>
<p> erty which is in litigation, provided there be nothing in the con-
</p>
<p>tract which savors of maintenance ; that is, provided he does not
</p>
<p>undertake to pay any costs, or make any advances beyond the
</p>
<p>mere support of the exclusive interest which he has so acquired."
</p>
<p>And he puts his conclusion upon the ground that a court of equity
</p>
<p>would, without special contract, compel the assignor to permit his
</p>
<p>name to be used in the suit, on the assignee's giving him indem-
</p>
<p>nity for such costs. "Such indemnity and such proceedings,
</p>
<p>under such circumstances," he adds, "are not deemed mainten-
</p>
<p>ance."'
</p>
<p>This seems to be the more correct and logical view, and better
</p>
<p>comports with the necessities of modern commerce, except as to
</p>
<p>transactions between client and attorney, which, by reason of
</p>
<p>their peculiar relation, ought perhaps to stand on a diiferent basis
</p>
<p>from other contracts savoring of a cluimpertous character ; '
</p>
<p>although by the great weight of modern authority contingent
</p>
<p>fees of a legitimate character, charged for professional services,
</p>
<p>dependent on the amount of recovery, are not deemed within the
</p>
<p>rules against champerty and maintenance.' Such em])loynieiits
</p>
<p>are not looked upon with approval in England.*

<p>person supposed to be in relation with a railroad company, under-

<p>takes for a consideration moving to it, to secure the location of
</p>
<p>stations, depots, etc., at a particular place. A conspicuous case

<p>ill this class is Fuller v. DcDne, 18 Pick. 472. All such contracts

<p>Where a railroad extension company is employed by a railroad

</p>
<p>the extension company and a third party, to select a long and

<p>expensive route, thus imposing an unnecessary and heavy burden
</p>
<p>upon the railroad company, the contract is void, as immoral in its
</p>
<p>conception and corrupting in its tendency. That the individual
</p>
<p>contracting with the extension company is a director and stock-

<p>agreement.*
</p>
<p>All arrangements by which directors or stockholders or other

<p>CONTRACTS TO INFLUENCE THE ACTION OF CORPORATIONS. 12T
</p>
<p>The case of Fuller v. Dame, 18 Pick. 472, is instructive on
</p>
<p>this head. It there appeared that Dame, the defendant, was the
</p>
<p>owner of a large tract of land and fiats situated on Sea Street,
</p>
<p>and between it and Front Street, on the south side of Boston, which
</p>
<p>would be greatly enhanced in value if the Boston and Worcester
</p>
<p>Railroad Company would locate one of its depots between those
</p>
<p>streets and easterly of Front Street. To induce the company to
</p>
<p>make such location it was supposed to be necessary to form an
</p>
<p>association, which would pay to it a large sum of money and fur-
</p>
<p>nish a large tract of land for the depot, besides making other
</p>
<p>donations ; and to provide the money and land, also to form a
</p>
<p>company to purchase the flats and land between the streets
</p>
<p>named, to be held as joint stock and laid out in due form and
</p>
<p>shape for sale. Fuller agreed to aid Dame in getting up such
</p>
<p>company, and in inducing the railroad company to fix its termina-
</p>
<p>tion and principal depot between those streets. Fuller being him-
</p>
<p>self of opinion that the railroad ought, from a view of the public
</p>
<p>good and the good of its stockholders, to enter the city on the
</p>
<p>southerly side and have its principal depot there. In considera-
</p>
<p>tion of such agreement Dame gave his note for $9,600, payable
</p>
<p>to Fuller in three years, the note being deposited with third par-
</p>
<p>ties, to be delivered to him when the principal depot of the rail-
</p>
<p>road company for merchandise was constructed between the streets
</p>
<p>mentioned. Fuller was at the time of the agreement a stock-
</p>
<p>holder in the railroad company. The road having been com-
</p>
<p>pleted, and the principal depot located between the streets men-
</p>
<p>tioned, and the note not being paid, suit was brought upon it. It
</p>
<p>was adjudged that the contract was contrary to public policy, and
</p>
<p>that the note given in consideration of it was therefore void.
</p>
<p>In coming to this conclusion the court considered somewhat at
</p>
<p>large the ground upon which contracts of this character were
</p>
<p>avoided, and held that it was because they tended to place one
</p>
<p>under wrong influences, by offering him a temptation to do that

</p>
<p>which might injuriously affect the rights and interests of third
</p>
<p>persons, and that the case before it was within the operation of
</p>
<p>this principle, the contract tending injuriously to affect the pub-
</p>
<p>lic interest in establishing the fittest and most suitable location
</p>
<p>for the termination of the Boston and Worcester Railroad for the
</p>
<p>128 PRIVATE CONTRACTS AND CIVIL GOVERNMENTS.
</p>
<p>accommodation of the public travel. It is true the road was con-
</p>
<p>structed and located by the corporation at tiie expense of private
</p>
<p>parties under the sanction of the Legislature, incorporated for
</p>
<p>that purpose, who were to be remunerated by a toll levied and
</p>
<p>regulated by law ; and it was left to its directors to fix the ter-
</p>
<p>mination and place of deposit. But in doing this a confidence
</p>
<p>was reposed in them, acting as agents for the public, a confidence
</p>
<p>which, it might seem, could have been safely so reposed, when it
</p>
<p>is considered that the interests of the corporation as a company
</p>
<p>of passenger and freight carriers for profit was identical with the
</p>
<p>interests of those who were to be carried and had goods to
</p>
<p>be carried, that is, with the public interest. This confidence,
</p>
<p>however, could only safely be so reposed under the belief
</p>
<p>that all the directors and members of the company should
</p>
<p>exercise their best and their unbiased judgment upon the
</p>
<p>question of such fitness, witliout being influenced by distinct
</p>
<p>and extraneous interests, having no connection with the accom-
</p>
<p>modation of the public or the interests of the company. Any
</p>
<p>attempt, therefore, to create and bring into efticient operation
</p>
<p>such undue influence has all the injurious efi^ects of a fraud
</p>
<p>upon the public, by causing a question which ought to be decided
</p>
<p>with a sole and single regard to public interests, to be affected
</p>
<p>and controlled by considerations having no regard to such inter-
</p>
<p>ests.
</p>
<p>In accordance with this view it has been declared that an agree-
</p>
<p>ment between a railroad oflicial and another to divide the profits
</p>
<p>on a contract to be secured by the latter, to furnish materials for
</p>
<p>a public improvement, the only service rendered by the former
</p>
<p>being to allow the latter lower freight rates than he demanded of
</p>
<p>others, is void as against public policy. Such a contract will not
</p>
<p>support an action to recover a share of the profits realized.*

<p>of a railroad company from becoming in any manner interested

<p>CONTBACTS TO INFLUENCE THE ACTION OF CORPORATIONS. 129
</p>
<p>It is no answer to say tliat, bj the Act of Incorporation, the
</p>
<p>executive authority was vested in a board of directors, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Fuller was not a director. He was a member of the company
</p>
<p>and might be chosen a director. He was an elector of the direc-
</p>
<p>tors, and they were directly responsible to the stockholders. The
</p>
<p>immediate act of location was with directors, but the efficient
</p>
<p>authority was with the members and stockholders of the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion, who elect the directors. The election may depend upon the
</p>
<p>known views and opinions of candidates upon this very question
</p>
<p>of location. They had a right to his disinterested judgment and
</p>
<p>advice upon the question of location; and this could not be exer-
</p>
<p>cised whilst he held and relied on a promise for a large sum of
</p>
<p>money, the payment of which depended upon this decision of the
</p>
<p>question by the directors.
</p>
<p>The case of Woodstoclc Iron Co. v. EicJiwond (& D. Extension
</p>
<p>Co. 129 U. S. 648, 32 L. ed. 819, is much stronger than the one
</p>
<p>thus decided by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>There the contract was held invalid because made with a stock-
</p>
<p>holder of the company, by which he promised, for a pecuniary
</p>
<p>consideration, to endeavor to procure the company to locate one
</p>
<p>of its depots at a particular place in the city. In the former case
</p>
<p>the contract was with an employe of the company, to induce it to
</p>
<p>disregard its obligations ; and the principal person making that
</p>
<p>contract on the part of the employe was a director and stockholder
</p>
<p>of the company which was to be thus seriously affected.
</p>
<p>The principle, which is so clearly and forcibly stated in Fuller
</p>
<p>V. Dame, has been applied in numerous instances by the highest
</p>
<p>courts of different states, to avoid contracts made to influence
</p>
<p>railroad companies in selecting their routes and locating their
</p>
<p>depots and stations, by donations of land and money to some of
</p>
<p>its directors or stockholders or agents. Thus in Bestor v. Wathen,
</p>
<p>60 111. 138, it appeared that in 1819 the Legislature of Illinois
</p>
<p>incorporated a company to build a railroad from a point on the

</p>
<p>Mississippi River to Peoria, and that in 1852 the charter was
</p>
<p>amended so as to authorize the extension of the road from Peoria
</p>
<p>eastward to the state line. In 1855 the company made a contract
</p>
<p>with the firm of Cruger, Secor and Company, by which the latter
</p>
<p>undertook the construction and equipment of the road. In 1856,

</p>
<p>whilst engaged upon this work, the members of the firm, togetlier
</p>
<p>with Bestor, the president of the railroad company, Sweat, one of
</p>
<p>its directors, and Smith, its construction agent, entered into a con-
</p>
<p>tract with "Wathen and Gibson, the defendants, by which the
</p>
<p>latter, being the owners of 160 acres of land, agreed, in considera-
</p>
<p>tion that the road then in process of construction should cross the
</p>
<p>Illinois Central Railroad where their land was situated, the land
</p>
<p>would be laid out into town lots and sold, and after proceeds
</p>
<p>amounting to $4,800 had been received, which were to be
</p>
<p>retained by Wathen and Gibson, a conveyance of an undivided
</p>
<p>half of the residue should be made to the other parties. The only
</p>
<p>consideration for this agreement, aside from the location of the
</p>
<p>road, was that the other parties should assist and contribute to the
</p>
<p>building up of the town on the land. The road was constructed
</p>

<p>land into lots and proceeded to sell the same, and the town of El

<p>Paso was built on the land and an adjoining tract. In 1863 the
</p>
<p>plaintiffs filed their bill against Wathen and Gibson for an account
</p>
<p>of the sales and a conveyance of the undivided half of the lots
</p>
<p>unsold. The court held the contract void as against public policy,
</p>
<p>and dismissed the suit, and the decree in this respect was affirmed
</p>
<p>by the Supreme Court of the State, that court observing that when
</p>
<p>the people through their Legislature grants to a company the
</p>
<p>right of eminent domain for the purpose of constructing a railroad
</p>
<p>it is upon the supposition that the road wiU bring certain benefits

<p>to the public, and that when subscriptions are made to its stock,
</p>
<p>the money is subscribed upon the understanding that the officers

<p>intrusted with the construction of the road will so locate its line
</p>
<p>and establish its depots as to bring the highest pecuniary profit to
</p>
<p>the stockholders, compatible with a proper regard for the pubhc

<p>convenience; that these alone are the considerations which should

<p>the public at large; and it added: " A court of equity will not
</p>
<p>enforce a contract resting upon such official delinquency, or

<p>even tending to produce it. Such is the character of the con-

</p>
<p>Co. 129 U. S. 643, 32 L. ed. 819. To enforce it would
</p>
<p>lend the sanction of the court to a class of contracts, the
</p>
<p>inevitable tendency of which is to make the officers of these
</p>
<p>powerful corporations pervert their trust to their private gain, at
</p>
<p>the price of injury at once to the stockholders and to the public.
</p>
<p>Kendered into plain English, the contract in Woodstock Iron Co.
</p>
<p>V. Hichmond c& D. Extension Co. was a bribe on the part of
</p>
<p>Wathen and Gibson to the president and other officers of the
</p>
<p>railway coinpany, and to the contractors who were building the
</p>
<p>road, of an undivided half of one hundred and sixty acres of land,
</p>
<p>in consideration of which the road was to be constructed on a cer-
</p>
<p>tain line and a depot built at a certain point. JSTow if this was the
</p>
<p>best line for crossing the Illinois Central considered with refer-
</p>
<p>ence to the interest of the stockholders and of the public, then it
</p>
<p>was the duty of the officers of the com^^any to establish it there;
</p>
<p>and if they intended so to do because it was the proper line, but
</p>
<p>professed to be hesitating between this and another line in order
</p>
<p>to secure to themselves the contract under consideration, as is
</p>
<p>somewhat indicated by the evidence, then they were practicing a
</p>
<p>species of fraud upon the defendants, and the use of a false pre-
</p>
<p>text in order to acquire defendants' property without considera-
</p>
<p>tion. If, on the other hand, this line was not the best, but was
</p>
<p>adopted because of this contract, the case is still stronger against
</p>
<p>the complainants. If such was the fact they are asking the court
</p>
<p>to enforce the payment of a bribe, the promise of which induced
</p>
<p>them to sacrifice their official duty to their private gain. If, as a
</p>
<p>third contingency, the choice lay between this line and another
</p>
<p>equally good, but not better, and they were influenced by this
</p>
<p>contract to adopt this line, then, although neither the company
</p>
<p>nor the public has been injured, yet the defendants have made
</p>
<p>their official power an instrument of private emolument in a man-
</p>
<p>ner which no court of equity can saction. In this particular case
</p>
<p>no wrong may have been done, and yet public policy plainly for-

</p>
<p>of Illinois in Linder v. Carpenter, 02 111. 309; and in 6'^, Louis,

<p>132 PRIVATE CONTKACTS AND CIVIL GOVERNMENTS.
</p>
<p>Holladay v. Patterson^ decided by the Supreme Court of Ore-
</p>
<p>gon (5 Or. 177), is also in harinony with Fuller v. Dame and
</p>
<p>JBestor v. Wathen^ the court following a similar course of reason-
</p>
<p>ing to that adopted in those cases. That doctrine and reasoning
</p>
<p>are also often applied where the reward or monej consideration
</p>
<p>for taking a particular route or establishing a station or depot at
</p>
<p>a particular place is offered directly to the railroad company
</p>
<p>instead of to its directors, stockholders, or agents. But there are
</p>
<p>exceptions or qualifications in the application of the doctrine in
</p>
<p>such cases requiring explanation, as where a subscription is con-
</p>
<p>ditioned upon the adoption of a particular route, or the construc-
</p>
<p>tion of a station or depot at a particular place.' There is no
</p>
<p>exception in any decision as to the character of a contract when
</p>
<p>for a pecuniary consideration directors, stockholders, or agents of
</p>
<p>a company undertake to influence its conduct in these matters.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the law is general that agreements upon pecuniary con-
</p>
<p>siderations, or the promise of them, to influence the conduct of
</p>
<p>ofiicers charged with duties affecting the public interest, or with
</p>
<p>duties of a fiduciary character to private parties, are against the
</p>
<p>true policy of the State, which is to secure fidelity in the discharge
</p>
<p>of all such duties. Agreements of that character introduce mer-
</p>
<p>cenary considerations to control the conduct of parties, instead of
</p>
<p>considerations arising from the nature of their duties and the most
</p>
<p>efficient way of discharging them. They are, therefore, necessa-
</p>
<p>rily corrupt in their tendencies. As was said in Providence Tool
</p>
<p>Co. V. Norris, 69 U. S. 2 Wall. 48, 56, 17 L. ed. 868, 871, "all
</p>
<p>agreements for pecuniary considerations to control the business
</p>
<p>operations of the government, or the regular administration of
</p>
<p>justice, or the appointments to public offices, or the ordinary
</p>
<p>course of legislation, are void as against public policy, without
</p>
<p>reference to the question whether improper means are contem-
</p>
<p>plated or used in their execution," so of agreements like this one;
</p>
<p>they are against public policy because of their corrupt tendency,

<p>the door to temptation by refusing them recognition in any of the
</p>
<p>courts of the country." * In regard to the exceptional class of
</p>
<p>contracts above referred to, in which an agreement has been made
</p>
<p>between an individual and a railroad corporation for the location
</p>
<p>of a station or depot at a particular place, in consideration of the
</p>
<p>donation of money or property to the corporation witliout any
</p>
<p>restriction or prohibition against any other location, it may
</p>
<p>be said that a contract to pay a given sum of money to
</p>
<p>one who should present a petition or proposition to the directors
</p>
<p>of a railroad company for the location of a depot on certain land
</p>
<p>the money to be paid on the location of the depot and completion
</p>
<p>of the road, is not void as against public policy, unless it appears
</p>
<p>that sinister, extraneous and corrupting influences were brought to
</p>
<p>bear upon the company to induce the location.'
</p>
<p>ISTo case has been found in which this question was particularly
</p>
<p>involved and the decision was adverse to the contract, which was not
</p>
<p>controlled by other considerations which condemn such an agree-
</p>
<p>ment. On the other hand it has been held that an agreement to
</p>
<p>pay a railroad company a stipulated snm in consideration that it
</p>
<p>would locate its route at a particular place, is valid and may be
</p>
<p>enforced.' So a conditional subscription of stock is valid,* and
</p>
<p>the voluntary grant to a railroad on condition that it would locate
</p>
<p>its route and establish a depot at a certain place, has been repeat-
</p>
<p>edly sustained as not being in contravention of public policy."
</p>
<p>But an agreement giving the exclusive right of way to a railroad
</p>
<p>company, in so far as it attempts to exclude other companies from
</p>
<p>acquiring a right of way over the same tract, upon land not
</p>
<p>appropriated or required for the use of the former company, is
</p>
<p>void as against public policy.*

<p>A contract for the sale of a portion of a subscriber's interest in

</p>

</p>
<p>The same doctrine has been applied to the directors of a private
</p>
<p>corporation, charged with duties of a fiduciary character to private
</p>
<p>parties, as to public ofiicials, on the view that it is public policy
</p>
<p>to secure fidelity in the discharge of such duties." But a stock-

<p>having conspired together for the conversion of its assets, each
</p>
<p>becomes liable for any act done by one of them in furtherance of
</p>
<p>the common design.'
</p>
<p>A personal liability for damages on the part of the official in
</p>
<p>case the other contractor should sue for violation of contract, is
</p>
<p>calculated to be a strong incentive to the official to act contrary to
</p>
<p>the true interests of the company and of its stockholders.*
</p>
<p>Thus it is held in West v. Camden, 135 U. S. 507, 34 L. ed. 254,
</p>
<p>that a contract with the president, who holds, as trustee, a con-
</p>
<p>trolling interest in the stock of a joint-stock company, that plain-
</p>
<p>tiff should be permanently retained as vice-president of such
</p>
<p>company at a salary of at least $5,000 per annum, is void as against
</p>
<p>public policy.
</p>
<p>That the consideration of such contract was the sale to the
</p>
<p>company of the property and business of a competing firm in
</p>
<p>which the plaintiff was partner, and that plaintiff would unite with
</p>
<p>his co-partners in such sale, and that defendant was interested as
</p>
<p>a stockholder in the purchasing company, does not make the con-
</p>
<p>tract valid.
</p>
<p>When the company, of which defendant was president, decided
</p>
<p>to reduce its expenses and a new board of directors was chosen,
</p>
<p>who elected as vice-president, in place of plaintiff, who had held
</p>
<p>the office and discharged its duties for five years, another person
</p>
<p>who agreed to serve without salary, plaintiff has no remedy against
</p>
<p>defendant on the contract.
</p>
<p>But a contract by a railroad company, in settlement of a claim
</p>
<p>for personal injuries, to give an employe permanent employment
</p>
<p>upon a svdtch engine, is not void as contrary to public policy in
</p>
<p>binding the company to employ him even if incapable of service,
</p>
<p>^s it will not compel the company to employ in that event.*

</p>
<p>a. Illegality need not be Pleaded.  The illegality of the con-
</p>
<p>tract in suit can be considered, although net affirmatively pleaded.'
</p>
<p>Parties concerned in illegal agreements are to be left without rem-
</p>
<p>edy against each other.^ The law aids no one to violate its behests,
</p>
<p>but leaves a party as it finds him, remediless to the consequences
</p>
<p>of his own folly and turpitude.^
</p>
<p>One who advances money to a majority stockholder to enable
</p>
<p>him to recover in his own name and for his own use a judgment
</p>
<p>properly belonging to the corporation, and with knowledge that
</p>
<p>the corporation was being thereby deprived of its property, will
</p>
<p>not be allowed his advances, on the distribution of the fund thus
</p>
<p>realized.*
</p>
<p>Courts will not decree the nullity of the contract sought to be
</p>
<p>enforced, but will simply abstain from dealing with it or adjudi-
</p>
<p>cating any rights arising thereunder, or giving their aid for the
</p>
<p>division of results, although ascertained, between the parties.*
</p>
<p>Courts will not relieve a party from the consequence of his
</p>
<p>intentional fraudulent or his negligent act.'
</p>
<p>Where a scheme or contract is malum in se, and the parties to
</p>
<p>it are in pari delicto, the law refuses to aid either of them
</p>
<p>against the other, but leaves them where they placed themselvea
</p>
<p>by their own acts.'

<p>138 WHEN COURTS WILL AND WHEN THEi' WILL NOT EELIEVE.
</p>
<p>courts of equity follow the rule of law as to participators in crime,
</p>
<p>and will not grant relief in accordance with the maxim " in jpari
</p>
<p>delicto potior est conditio defendentisP
</p>
<p>It is contrary to public policy to give the aid of the courts to
</p>
<p>the vendor, who knew that his goods were purchased, or to the
</p>
<p>lender who was aware that his money was borrowed, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of being employed in the commission of a criminal act
</p>
<p>injurious to society or to any of its members.*
</p>
<p>A party to an illegal trust combination, who, in pursuance of
</p>
<p>the agreement, has furnished goods in the name of the trustee,
</p>
<p>cannot claim the proceeds as against a receiver of the trust assets,
</p>
<p>although he withdi'ew from the combination before the receiver
</p>
<p>was appointed.*
</p>
<p>Where losses have been made in an illegal transaction, a person
</p>
<p>who lends money to the loser with which to pay the debt can
</p>
<p>recover the loan, notwithstanding his knowledge of the fact that
</p>
<p>the money was to be so used.' The rule however seems to be
</p>
<p>less exacting in some states." "Where one conveys land to secure
</p>
<p>the grantee's public influence, to defeat the extension of a street
</p>
<p>across his land, and the grantee dies before re-conveying, the
</p>
<p>heirs will not be compelled to re-convey to the grantor,*
</p>
<p>Where two or more parties have united in a transaction to
</p>
<p>defraud another or others, or the public, or the due administration
</p>
<p>of justice, or where it was against public policy, or contrary to
</p>
<p>good morals, no one of them can maintain a suit thereon against
</p>
<p>any other.*
</p>
<p>A court of equity will not lend its aid to require an account of
</p>
<p>profits and a division thereof, although the contract has been exe-
</p>
<p>cuted.'
</p>
<p>Whatever the parties have fraudulently or illegally contracted
</p>
<p>to execute, the law refuses to compel the contractor to execute,

</p>
<p>Equity will not relieve from securities executed to shield a
</p>
<p>person from prosecution for a felony of which he is guilty, upon
</p>
<p>the ground that execution for such purpose rendered them void.
</p>
<p>One who has executed and delivered securities in consideration
</p>
<p>of a promise to refrain from a prosecution for felony of a person
</p>
<p>guilty thereof cannot, after his illegal purpose has failed from

</p>
<p>been commenced by thii'd parties, rescind the contract and recover
</p>
<p>back the securities.'
</p>
<p>The moment the fact of illegality appears, the court will refuse

<p>relief to either party, but will leave them where their illicit agree-

<p>Wherever two or more persons are engaged in a fraudulent

<p>the one is unknown to the other, the latter may disaffirm or carry

</p>
<p>adequate remedy, or full compensation can be obtained, in an
</p>
<p>action at law; and a court of equity is equally adverse to exer-
</p>
<p>cise its authority by way of injunction, to compel one, even
</p>
<p>under an express contract, to work for another at a stipulated
</p>
<p>price. Equity will not use its special power against the general
</p>
<p>policy of the law, which favors entire freedom of the laborer in
</p>
<p>selecting his field of employment, and his employer, and this
</p>
<p>policy forbids a court of equity to interfere even when he has
</p>
<p>bound himself by contract as to both. This is illustrated in two
</p>
<p>cases decided December 10th, 1891, not yet reported, in which^
</p>
<p>at Memphis, Tenn., Judge Hammond, in the United States Cir-
</p>
<p>cuit Court, refused the application of the Louisville and ISTash-
</p>
<p>ville Railroad Company, for an injunction to compel the Memphis
</p>
<p>Cotton Compress Company to comply with its contract to com-
</p>
<p>press cotton bales at 10 cents per 100 pounds. The compress
</p>
<p>company has a monopoly of compressing cotton, having bought
</p>
<p>or driven out all competitors, and it has a contract with all the
</p>
<p>railroad comjmnies to compress cotton for five years at 10 cents
</p>
<p>per hundred. However, to make up recent heavy losses by fire,
</p>
<p>or for other reasons, it has notified all the railroad companies that
</p>
<p>they must pay 12 cents per hundred for compression, and it
</p>
<p>refuses to perform the contract.
</p>
<p>There being no other compress company available, this leaves
</p>
<p>the railroads no alternative but to pay the extra price, unless the
</p>
<p>compress comj^any could be compelled by injunction to perform
</p>
<p>its contract. As soon as the notice was given the Newport J^ews
</p>
<p>and Mississippi Yalley Company filed a bill to compel the com-
</p>
<p>press company to take 10 cents, but Judge Hammond refused the
</p>
<p>injunction because it did not appear that the contract had been
</p>
<p>actually violated. Only a proposition had been made to charge
</p>
<p>more for compression.
</p>
<p>The Louisville and ISTashviUe Railroad Company also filed a
</p>
<p>bill, which alleged the tender of cotton for compression, and the

<p>refusal to do the work for less than 12 cents; also that the com-
</p>
<p>press company was ignoring the stipulation to compress only
</p>
<p>for the railroads and was working for shippers direct, and demand-
</p>
<p>ing 12 cents.
</p>
<p>The injunction was refused on the ground that a court of equity
</p>
<p>RELIEF FROM ILLEGAL CONTRACTS. 143^
</p>
<p>will not compel anyone to work for another at a stipulated price,
</p>
<p>but it leaves the injured party to bring an action for damages at
</p>
<p>law. This being an adequate remedy, the jurisdiction of equity
</p>
<p>is forbidden to United States courts by an Act of Congress.
</p>
<p>The railroad company contended that the public interest was
</p>
<p>affected by the disturl)ance of freight rates and disastrous com-
</p>
<p>petition with points where compression of cotton could be done
</p>
<p>for less price than demanded at Memphis, but Judge Hammond
</p>
<p>ruled that the public policy which forbids unnecessary interfer-
</p>
<p>ence by courts with the conduct of business under contracts, and
</p>
<p>forbids a jurisdiction that would restrict by such orders the free-
</p>
<p>dom of the economic laws of trade and commerce, was as import-
</p>
<p>ant as the other consideration urged in favor of the injunction,
</p>
<p>and denied the application.

</p>
<p>a. In Pari Delicto  Ultra Vires.  It is a rule of law, well
</p>
<p>recognized, that where parties to a contract are in pari delicto, one
</p>
<p>of them shall not avail himself of fraud in the contract to prevent
</p>
<p>the other from recovering on his share of the profits, after the
</p>
<p>contract is executed, if the other can make out his case otherwise
</p>
<p>than through the medium or by the aid of the illegal transaction
</p>
<p>to which he himself was a party ;'^ but in cases where both parties
</p>
<p>are in delicto, concurring in the illegal act, it does not always follow
</p>
<p>that they stand in jpari delicto, for there may be and very often
</p>
<p>are very different degrees in their guilt.'
</p>
<p>The maxim ''In pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis
</p>
<p>et possidentis^^ is not of universal prevalence. An exception
</p>
<p>arises where the parties to the transaction, although concurring in
</p>
<p>the illegal act, are regarded as not equally guilty in consequence
</p>
<p>of fraud, imposition or hardship practiced by one party against
</p>
<p>the other, thereby obtaining an unconscionable advantage.*

<p>Where the defendant has been from beginning to end the prin
</p>

</p>
<p>the plaintiff, and the power thereby acquired and maintained by
</p>
<p>it over the plaintiff, to promote its own schemes and enterprises,
</p>
<p>the two parties are not in jyari delicto, whatever meaning be
</p>
<p>given to the word delictum}
</p>
<p>The fact that a transaction is against public policy in law will
</p>
<p>not prevent a remedy against one party, who is guilty of fraud by
</p>
<p>means of his persuasive or other influence over the other pai-ty, in
</p>
<p>favor of the latter, who is not consciously wrong, but who is
</p>
<p>actually deceived by the fraud and misrepresentations of the
</p>
<p>former party."
</p>
<p>When an innocent member of a firm established for the conduct
</p>
<p>of lawful and moral business calls upon his partner for a share of
</p>
<p>profits made in partnership transactions, the partner will not be
</p>
<p>absolved from the duty of dividing, on showing that he realized
</p>
<p>the profits by cheating the customers of the firm.'

<p>operates a rival line subject to penalty, although such continuation
</p>
<p>was illegal, cannot retain the money acquired by such operation
</p>
<p>when called upon by the owner of the road for an accounting,
</p>
<p>but the latter, not being in pari delicto, is entitled to an equitable
</p>
<p>share of the earnings."

<p>The plea of ultima vires should not prevail, whether interposed

<p>IN PARI DELICTO ULTRA. VIRES. 145
</p>
<p>The law sustains a defense of this nature only when an imj)era-
</p>
<p>tive rule of public policy requires it.'
</p>
<p>The rule against granting relief to a party to an illegal contract
</p>
<p>does not apply to prevent a receiver from recovering the fruits of
</p>
<p>the transaction for the benefit of honest creditors.^
</p>
<p>The rule that, where one transfers property to another for the
</p>
<p>jiurpose of cheating his creditors, the court will not aid him to
</p>
<p>recover it back, does not apply where the plaintiff and defendant
</p>
<p>were not in pari delicto^ the defendant being the plaintiff's law-
</p>
<p>yer, under whose direction the latter acted and followed his advice
</p>
<p>that transfers were necessary to protect and cover up the property
</p>
<p>of his deceased father against the assaults of creditors.'
</p>
<p>But on tlie dissolution of an illegal partnership or combination
</p>
<p>to monopolize the manufacture and sale of a commodity, and the
</p>
<p>appointment of a receiver, neither the receiver nor any party to the
</p>
<p>illegal agreement can have any equitable relief based upon alleged
</p>
<p>rights growing out of such illegal combination.*
</p>
<p>Since, on the dissolution of a corporation which had entered
</p>
<p>into an illegal combination or copartnership with others to monop-
</p>
<p>olize the manufacture and sale of a commodity, the copartnership
</p>
<p>is dissolved, and a receiver of the corporation cannot enforce the
</p>
<p>right to have an accounting under the partnership agreement
</p>
<p>because of its illegality, he has no right that a court of equity can
</p>
<p>enforce, or which will justify a decree that a contract between
</p>
<p>the parties, to which he was not a party, should be canceled or
</p>
<p>declared illegal. *
</p>
<p>But the court will not refuse to enforce an express trust for the
</p>
<p>reason that the conveyance to the trustee, who has declared the
</p>
<p>trust, was to delay, hinder, and defraud the grantor's wife in
</p>
<p>obtaining alimony and maintenance in a suit which it was appre-

<p>b. Iiidepeiideiit of Contract  Locus P(iiitentiap!.  If the
</p>
<p>plamtiif requires any aid from the illegal transaction in order to
</p>
<p>enable him to sue his claim, he cannot enforce it.'
</p>
<p>Where a contract grows immediately out of, and is connected
</p>
<p>with an illegal or immoral act, it will not be enforced,^ The test
</p>
<p>to determine whether the action arises ex stirjpe causa, is the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff's ability to establish his case without any aid from the illegal
</p>
<p>transaction. If his cause or right to recover depends upon a trans-
</p>
<p>action which is malum in se or prohibited by law, and which he
</p>
<p>must prove in order to make out his case, he cannot recover,*
</p>
<p>An obligation will be enforced, though indirectly connected
</p>
<p>with an illegal transaction, if it is supported by an independent
</p>
<p>consideration, so that the plaintilf does not require the aid of the
</p>
<p>illegal transaction to make out his case.*
</p>
<p>Money paid on an illegal contract, which remains executory,
</p>
<p>can be recovered back in an action founded on a disaffirmance and
</p>
<p>on the ground that it is void.' Where parties have come to a
</p>
<p>locus pmnitentioe, the courts allow them to recover money advanced.
</p>
<p>In- such cases the contract is not the basis of a suit but the rescis-
</p>
<p>sion of it.^

<p>his nephew as follows : " My dear Lancey : I am so glad to hear
</p>
<p>of your intended marriage with Ellen Nicholl, and, as I promised
</p>
<p>to assist you at starting, I am happy to tell you that 1 will pay
</p>
<p>you 150 pounds yearly during my life and until your annual in-
</p>
<p>come derived from your profession of a chancery barrister shall
</p>
<p>amount to 600 guineas, of which your own admission will be the
</p>
<p>only evidence that I shall receive or require. Your affectionate
</p>
<p>uncle, Charles Shadwell." It was held that the promise was bind-
</p>
<p>ing, and made upon good consideration. So also marriage is a
</p>
<p>good consideration for a deed.*
</p>
<p>It is declared by the courts a consideration of the highest value.

<p>An agreement by a father with the future husband of his ille-

<p>gitimate daughter, to settle, at his, the father's, death, his " whole

<p>endeavor to do her equal justice with the rest of his daughters,
</p>
<p>-as fast as it is in his power, with convenience," and the marriage
</p>
<p>be afterwards had with his consent, the promise is not void
</p>
<p>ior uncertainty, and is sustained by a sufficient consideration.
</p>
<p>Such promise is to be treated not as made in the interest of the
</p>
<p>wife alone, but to the husband and wife jointly, not to be satisfied
</p>
<p>by a conveyance of land to the wife alone ; but the husband may
</p>
<p>elect to consider it a personal contract, and, if he survives his wife,
</p>
<p>sue thereon in his own name.*
</p>
<p>A promised B if he would get himself a wife and have a child
</p>
<p>he would give him $500. In an action by B to recover, this sum
</p>
<p>from the executor of A, the condition having been fully performed
</p>
<p>relying on the promise, the promise was held to be supported by
</p>
<p>a good consideration.*

<p>152 CONTRACTS AFFECTING MARRIAGE.
</p>
<p>The law favors an ante-nuptial settlement executed in gooct
</p>
<p>faith, and the agreement will be considered as having embodied
</p>
<p>the real intention of the parties at its date, and therefore con-
</p>
<p>clusive of the rights of the parties to it ; and the resumption of
</p>
<p>her marital duties by a wife, who has voluntarily estranged her-
</p>
<p>self from her husband because of her dissatisfaction with such a
</p>
<p>contract, is no consideration for a revocation of the settlement,
</p>
<p>substituting therefore her rights under a statute. There must be-
</p>
<p>a meritorious or valuable consideration for such a revocation of
</p>
<p>an anti-nuptial settlement.* Where the sole inducement was the
</p>
<p>doing of that which the wife was legally bound to do  -the
</p>
<p>estrangement having been without justification, and a wanton
</p>
<p>abuse of the marital relation for mercenary purposes, reconcile-
</p>
<p>ment was her duty  public policy forbids that the performance
</p>
<p>of such duty be made the subject of barter and sale. The law
</p>
<p>fixes and regulates the marital relation on public consideration and
</p>
<p>will not allow the parties to discard and renew it for money.*
</p>
<p>Thus in Roberts v. Frkhy, 38 Tex. 229, the Supreme Court held
</p>
<p>that the husband is not legally bound by a post-nuptial contract
</p>
<p>in which he hires his wife to live with him. The same principle
</p>
<p>was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Teimessee in Copeland v.
</p>
<p>Boaz, 9 Baxt. 223 ; and Mr. Justice Allen of the Supreme Ju-
</p>
<p>dicial Court of Massachusetts well said : " It is as much against
</p>
<p>public policy to restore interrupted conjugal relations as it is tO'
</p>
<p>continue them without interruption for the same consideration.
</p>
<p>The right of condonation is not exercised for the sake of justice
</p>
<p>to the injured party, or with regard to the rights of others or the
</p>
<p>interests of the public when it is sold for money, and the law can-
</p>
<p>not recognize such a consideration." ^
</p>
<p>An undertaking to procure a marriage between two parties for
</p>
<p>a reward is void," and all marriage brokerage contracts are by the
</p>
<p>courts pronounced illegal.^

<p>CONTRACT FOR IMMEDIATE SEPARATION AND SL'i'PORT. 153
</p>
<p>A contract providing, in consideration of certain assessments-
</p>
<p>paid and to be paid by a single man, that an association will pay
</p>
<p>a certain sum to his wife at marriage, if married to him at the
</p>
<p>expiration of two years, is illegal.'
</p>
<p>A claim for services rendered to a man in procuring for him a
</p>
<p>wife is invalid, it being against public policy to allow marriage
</p>
<p>brokerage.* So any contract which has for its purpose a rupture-
</p>
<p>of the marriage relation, is void.^
</p>
<p> 26. A Contract for Iiiiniediate Separation and Support,
</p>
<p>or for Support after Accomplished Separation, Valid.  It was
</p>
<p>reluctantly held by the chancellor in Carson v, Murray, 3 Paige,
</p>
<p>500, 3 L. ed. 248, and then only upon the principle of stare decisis
</p>
<p>as evinced by Baker v. Barney, 8 Johns. 73, and Shelthar v. Greg-
</p>
<p>ory, 2 Wend. 422, following the English decisions prior to the Revo-
</p>
<p>lution, that a valid agreement for an immediate separation between
</p>
<p>husband and wife and for a separate allowance for her support,
</p>
<p>may be made through the medium of a trustee.
</p>
<p>The case of Carson v. Murray, 3 Paige, 483, 3 L. ed. 241, was
</p>
<p>upon a bill in equity by the wife against the executors of her hus-
</p>
<p>band, based upon an agreement of separation, for its enforcement
</p>
<p>out of the estate of the deceased husband.^ See also Chapin v.
</p>
<p>Chapin, 135 Mass. 393. But where the agreement was concealed
</p>
<p>from the court pending the divorce proceedings, it cannot always
</p>
<p>be enforced.
</p>
<p>The case of Baker v. Barney, 8 Johns. 72, was an action to
</p>
<p>recover of the husband the price of suitable goods sold to the wife
</p>
<p>after the separation of husband and wife, under an agreement
</p>
<p>making provision for the support of the wife.

</p>
<p>And the case of Shelihar v. Gregory, 2 Wend. 432, was an action
</p>
<p>upon the bond and agreement to separate, and the defense was
</p>
<p>that after the bond was given and before tlie instalhnent or sum
</p>
<p>fell due by the terms of the agreement, the wife returned to and
</p>
<p>was living with the husband, and was supported by him. In
</p>
<p>these cases, the husband and wife were living together wlien the
</p>
<p>agreement of articles of separation were executed, and separated
</p>
<p>immediately thereafter. The ruling of the court was to the effect
</p>
<p>that such articles of separation, considered under these various
</p>
<p>aspects, were valid. These holdings were based upon decisions
</p>
<p>made in the English courts, and neither the English nor our own
</p>
<p>courts have departed or receded from the principle thus laid down.
</p>
<p>While the husband and wife in Calkins v. Long, 22 Barb. 98, had
</p>
<p>actually separated before the agreement of separation was exe-
</p>
<p>cuted, the court, in holding that the agreement was valid, cites
</p>
<p>numerous decisions with approval, in England and several of the
</p>
<p>states of the Union, to the effect that such agreements are valid
</p>
<p>and will be enforced where the separation had taken place before,
</p>
<p>or takes place immediately after, the execution of the agreement
</p>
<p>of separation ; and this case is said (in a note upon page 110) to
</p>
<p>have been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
</p>
<p>Judge Davis, in delivering the opinion of the court in Walker
</p>
<p>V. Walker, 76 U. S. 9 Wall. 743, 19 L. ed. 814, while regretting,
</p>
<p>upon the score of public policy, that the courts of England and of
</p>
<p>this country had gone so far, was, as was the chancellor in Calkins
</p>
<p>V, Long, 22 Barb. 103, constrained to hold that a covenant by the
</p>
<p>husband for the maintenance of the wife, contained in a deed of
</p>
<p>separation between them, through the medium of trustees, where
</p>
<p>the consideration is apparent, is valid, and will be enforced in
</p>
<p>equity, if it appears that the deed was not made in contemplation
</p>
<p>of a future possible separation, but in respect to one which was
</p>
<p>to occur innnediately, or for the continuance of one which had
</p>
<p>already taken place. Indeed it has long since become the settled

<p>The decision in Holhrook v. Comstoclc, 16 Gray, 109, was based
</p>
<p>upon the assumed validity of such a contract. The validity of
</p>
<p>such contracts was reluctantly conceded in Alhee v. Wyman^ 10

<p>An agreement not to take legal steps to avoid a fraudulent di-

<p>When a separation has actually taken jDlace or been fully de-

<p>156 CONTRACTS AFFECTING MARRIAGE.
</p>
<p>Where they had actually separated, and were living apart at the
</p>
<p>time such agreement was made, the agreement is valid."
</p>
<p>A bond made to a wife's father to secure a separate maintenance-
</p>
<p>for the wife, wjio had separated from her husband, the obUgor,
</p>
<p>for their mutual comfort, to avoid the effect of jealousies and an-
</p>
<p>imosities that existed between them, is founded upon a legal and
</p>
<p>meritorious consideration.*
</p>
<p>So, it has been held that a woman may maintain an action on a
</p>
<p>promissory note given to her by her former husl^and after divorce
</p>
<p>from him, in pursuance of a written agreement conditioned upon
</p>
<p>the divorce being decreed, the note being given and accepted in
</p>
<p>lieu of alimony.*
</p>
<p> 27. Agreement for Separation and Support Supersedes
</p>
<p>Only in Part Marital Duties.  Such agreements take the place,
</p>
<p>as far as they extend, of the duties and obligations of the law in
</p>
<p>relation to husband and wife and their children. But they do riot
</p>
<p>supersede or render inoperative other duties and obligations im-
</p>
<p>posed by law upon liusband and wife toward each other and toward
</p>
<p>their children. They are still husband and wife, but living apart
</p>
<p>from each other, and bound to observe all the other domestic du-
</p>
<p>ties resting upon them as husband and wife and parents, not jjro-
</p>
<p>vided for in the agreement of separation. Neither of them can
</p>
<p>marry nor commit adultery without incurring the consequences
</p>
<p>and the penalty prescribed by law to husbands and wives who
</p>
<p>commit those offenses. Hence we find numerous decisions of the
</p>
<p>courts in nearly all civilized countries holding that either husband
</p>
<p>or wife may, notwithstanding the existence of such agreement
</p>
<p>between them, maintain against the other the ordinary action for
</p>
<p>divorce, limited or absolute, according to the ground and the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and whether the ground therefor accrued before or
</p>
<p>after such agreement was entered into.*

<p>with their agreement. Where husband and wife agree upon ali-

<p>mony, the court will embody their agreement upon that subject
</p>
<p>in its decree.'
</p>
<p> 29. Contraet Void when Immediate Separation not Con-
</p>
<p>templated.  But where the instrument, no matter what the-
</p>
<p>inducing cause may have been, does not contemplate an imme-
</p>
<p>diate separation, it is void, as it may operate as an inducement
</p>
<p>to the separation, and therefore against the policy of the law."
</p>
<p>An agreement, therefore, is of no effect unless the parties are
</p>
<p>separated when the agreement is entered into, or unless they sep-
</p>
<p>arate afterwards in pursuance of the agreement, which has not
</p>
<p>been the promotive cause.*
</p>
<p>The validity of such agreements is recognized and enforced in
</p>
<p>numerous cases decided by the courts.*
</p>
<p> 30. Contracts Regarding Property, but in Partial Re-
</p>
<p>straint of Marriage.  Contracts concerning property, which
</p>
<p>operate in partial restraint of marriage, are not void, if they are-
</p>
<p>reasonable in themselves, and do not directly or virtually operate
</p>
<p>as an undue restraint upon the freedom of marriage. If the con-
</p>
<p>dition is in restraint of marriage generally, then, indeed, as a con-
</p>
<p>dition against public policy and the economy and morality of
</p>
<p>domestic life, it will be held utterly void.^ But a contract where-

<p>by a husband agrees to pay his divorced wife a specified monthly
</p>
<p>sura for so long a time as she does not marry again and shall
</p>
<p>remain single and unmarried, is not void as in restraint of mar-
</p>
<p>riage.'
</p>
<p>A condition in a will which holds out to the legatee an induce-
</p>
<p>ment to live separate and apart from her husband is void as
</p>
<p>against public policy. Thus, in Brown v. Peek, 1 Eden, 140, the
</p>
<p>will provided that the legatee should be paid two pounds per
</p>
<p>month if she lived with her husband, but if she lived from him, and
</p>
<p>with her mother, she should be paid five pounds a month.
</p>
<p>In Wren v. Bradley, 2 DeG. & S. 49, the bequest was " to my
</p>
<p>daughter, Ann Jefferies AYren, the wife of Abraham Wren, in
</p>
<p>case she shall be living apart from her said husband, the said
</p>
<p>Abraham Wren, and shall continue so to do during the hfetime of
</p>
<p>my said wife, an annuity of 30, by equal quarterly payments, the
</p>
<p>first of such payments to be made at the expiration of three cal-
</p>
<p>endar months next after my decease. And I do hereby further
</p>
<p>direct that, if at any time the said Ann Jeflieries Wren shall
</p>
<p>cohabit with the said Abraham Wren, the said annuity hereinbe-
</p>
<p>fore given to her shall, during the time she shall so cohabit, abso-
</p>
<p>lutely cease and determine."
</p>
<p>In Conrad v. Long, 33 Mich. 79, the clause of the will was as
</p>
<p>follows: " To my brother, Frederick S. Conrad, I give and
</p>
<p>bequeath the one half so remaining, and the other half I give and
</p>
<p>bequeath to my sister, Elizabeth Long, upon this condition:  if at
</p>
<p>any time subsequent she should conclude not to live with her
</p>
<p>present husband, Henry Long, as his wife. But if she continue
</p>
<p>so to live as the wife of the said Henry Long until her death,,
</p>
<p>then, in that case, I give and bequeath all my property, real and
</p>
<p>personal, remaining after the burial of my mother aforesaid, tO'
</p>
<p>my aforesaid brother, Frederick S. Conrad."
</p>
<p>In all of these cases the conditions quoted were very properly
</p>
<p>held to have been void. The reason is apparent. They held out
</p>
<p>a direct inducement for the legatees to live separate and apart

</p>
<p>the separation and violation of their marital duties and obligations
</p>
<p>without any just cause, and in an unlawful manner. This was not

<p>ItJU CONTRACTS AFFECTING MAKRIAGE.
</p>
<p>SO in the case of Born v. ITorstmann^ 5 L. R. A. 577, 80 Cal. 454,
</p>
<p>where it was held that a bequest to testator's daii^^hters which
</p>
<p>provides that in case either of them shall become a widow, or
</p>
<p>otherwise become lawfully separated from her husband, she shall
</p>
<p>receive her share of the property absolutely, instead of the income,
</p>
<p>which is given to her while she remains a wife, is not void as
</p>
<p>against public policy on the ground of encouraging the daughters
</p>
<p>to live separate or be divorced from their husbands.
</p>
<p>In that case the condition coxtW not be complied with except
</p>
<p>by a legal separation, and for causes found by a court of justice to
</p>
<p>be sufficient. This being so, there was nothing unlawful in the
</p>
<p>condition. It is true it may be said that it would have a tendency
</p>
<p>to induce the wife to assert her legal right to a divorce and sepa-
</p>
<p>ration, and that but for such inducement such right might have
</p>
<p>been waived, Imt it can hardly be said that it is against public
</p>
<p>poHcy to attach to a legacy such a condition as will tend to induce
</p>
<p>a legatee to do a lawful act in a lawful way.
</p>
<p>The precise question presented here has been before the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of Vermont, in which the will provided that the legatee
</p>
<p>should have the income of the estate, and such further sums as
</p>
<p>her wants might demand, so long as she remained the wife of I.
</p>
<p>A. Thayer; but if she was " left a widow, or for any cause should
</p>
<p>cease to be the wife of said Thayer," the whole estate should be
</p>
<p>given to her. In that case the court said: " The ground upon
</p>
<p>which it is claimed that the provision of tlie will violates public
</p>
<p>j)olicy is that it furnishes an inducement to the wife to become the
</p>
<p>widow of her husband, or to separate herself from him in such a
</p>
<p>manner that she would cease to be his wife. The appellants, to
</p>
<p>sustain this claim, rely upon the rule as stated in 2 Kedf. Wills,
</p>
<p>293; 1 Story, Eq. Jur. 291, and the case of Conrad v. Long, 33
</p>
<p>Mich. 78.
</p>
<p>'' The cases cited in support of the rule laid down in Redfield
</p>
<p>and Story, it will be found on examination, do not sustain the
</p>
<p>rule as here sought to be applied. They are generally cases in

<p>which an inducement was directly held out to encourage a volun-
</p>
<p>tary separation of husband and wife, and where the intent to
</p>
<p>enconrage such a separation could be found in the language
</p>
<p>employed in making the bequest. They are none of them so sim-

<p>ilar in their facts to the case at bar that they can be considered
</p>
<p>authorities in it. Tlie first object is to ascertain, if possible, what
</p>
<p>the intention of the testatrix was; and we find no difticultj in
</p>
<p>reaching the conchision that it was to have her estate disposed of
</p>
<p>just as it has been by the probate court. It was a wise and pru-
</p>
<p>dent provision to make for her daughter. While she should
</p>
<p>remain a wife, her husband would be under obligation to support
</p>
<p>her, and hence the income only was absolutely left her during the
</p>
<p>continuance of that relation; but when she should cease to be a
</p>
<p>wife, and so become dependent upon her own resources, it was
</p>
<p>just and wise to provide that she should have the entire estate." *
</p>
<p>Not only may there be a good and sufficient reason, as stated in
</p>
<p>the opinion cited, for providing that the legatee shall not have the
</p>
<p>bulk of the property until she is deprived of the support of a hus-
</p>
<p>band, but there may be the best of reasons for placing the same
</p>
<p>in such condition that she cannot be improperly induced by a
</p>
<p>worthless or profligate husliand to squander it, while she con-
</p>
<p>tinues to be his wife, and, it may be, under his influence and con-
</p>
<p>trol. Such a condition in a will is not only valid, but under certain
</p>
<p>circumstances it may be just and commendable.'

<p> 31. Excluding One from Pursuing His Trade or Employ-

<p>ment.  The decision in Mltdiel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wnis. 181,
</p>
<p>Smith's Leading Cases, voL 1, pt. 11, 508, may be regarded as the
</p>
<p>first announcement of the rule in relation to the invalidity of con-
</p>
<p>tracts in restraint of trade. The rule was then adjusted to exist-
</p>
<p>ing conditions and to the state of social and commercial life.
</p>
<p>The object of government, as interpreted by the judges, was
</p>
<p>not to interfere with the free and independent right of man to
</p>
<p>dispose of his property or of his labor; it was to guard society, of
</p>
<p>which he was a member, from the injurions consequences of his
</p>
<p>agreements, whether they would arise from his own improvidence
</p>
<p>in bargaining away his means of gaining a livelihood, or in the
</p>
<p>deprivation to society of the advantages of competition in skilled
</p>
<p>labor.'
</p>
<p>The attempt on the part of tiie law was to leave the party free
</p>
<p>to contract in regard to his own labor and yet, consistent with
</p>
<p>that freedom, to prevent injurious results to the public from loss
</p>
<p>of the avails of labor, with regard to which he had contracted.

</p>
<p>the said party of the first part, hereby, for hinisslf, his executors,
</p>
<p>administrators and assigns, covenant, etc., that for the period of
</p>
<p>five years he will not continue in or carry on the business of man-
</p>
<p>ufacturing or dealing in bed-quilts or comfortables, or of any
</p>
<p>business of which they form a part; that he will not eiiter into the
</p>
<p>cotton waste business in the city of Fall River, or influence others
</p>
<p>to do so, or make any bid therefor or induce others to
</p>
<p>do so." The first restriction was held clearly illegal, it being
</p>
<p>a general agreement, without any limitation of space, that during
</p>
<p>the period of five years he will not directly or indirectly continue
</p>
<p>in, carry on or engage in the business of manufacturing or dealing
</p>
<p>in certain articles of commerce.
</p>
<p>So a contract was held void if it exclude the obligor from
</p>
<p>engaging in a useful trade as an iron founder, everywhere and for
</p>
<p>all time.'
</p>
<p>An agreement not to engage for eight years in the manufacture
</p>
<p>of a certain yeast powder, nor in any branch of the yeast business,
</p>
<p>is unlimited and void;^ but a contract unlimited territorially, save
</p>
<p>by the words " so far as the law allows," is not void as being in
</p>
<p>conflict with public policy, nor as being too uncertain in its terms
</p>
<p>to be capable of being enforced. Such a covenant is to be con-
</p>
<p>strued as providing for a restraint to the full extent that the rule,
</p>
<p>;.s enforced by the courts, will allow a person to contract against
</p>
<p>his right of trading in a particular business, and will be given
</p>
<p>efl^ect so as to secure to the covenantee the full benefit of that
</p>
<p>Avliich he has purchased from the covenantor.' Such a contract
</p>
<p>is transferable, with the assignment of the business to aid which

<p>it was made.'' The courts will enforce such contracts where they

<p>are reasonable and restrain all attempts to evade the restriction;'
</p>
<p>l)nt an agreement not to sell milk in a town is not violated by
</p>
<p>selling to anotlier residing outside the town, with knowledge mere-
</p>
<p>ly that the purchaser intends to retail the milk within the town."
</p>
<p>The fact that two men had been engaged as rivals in manu-
</p>
<p>facturing an article for domestic use will not prevent one of
</p>
<p>them from giving up the independent manufacture, and uniting
</p>
<p>as a 25artner wdth the other for a term of years, the price of the
</p>
<p>manufactured article being lixed in the contract of partnership."
</p>
<p>The withdrawal of labor from a special business within a
</p>
<p>limited locality is therefore sustained; under this theory the law
</p>
<p>of partnership exists.*
</p>
<p>Trade with a newly discovered line of coast may be limited by
</p>
<p>contract to the actual business prospects for the Qpening of inter-
</p>
<p>course profitably.*
</p>
<p>A store-keeper may contract with a manufacturer that the latter
</p>
<p>will induce his workmen to trade w^th the merchant, on con-
</p>
<p>dition of his paying the manufacturer 8 per cent on all sales to
</p>
<p>such employes;^ but it has been held that such a contract, by
</p>
<p>which the lessee of a coal mine, as part of the rent of the mine,
</p>
<p>contracted to use his^ eiforts to control the patronage of his
</p>
<p>employes and their families, in favor of the lessor, and that the
</p>
<p>lessee should refuse to recognize any orders given upon him by
</p>
<p>any employe upon any other merchant for goods purchased from
</p>
<p>them, nor would he give any order, due-bill or evidence of
</p>
<p>indebtedness transferable to such other store-keeper for goods,
</p>
<p>was void as in restraint of trade, injurious to the employes and
</p>
<p>tending to extortion, opjDression, and to create a monopoly.'

<p>not unreasonable for the protection of the parties,' because they
</p>
<p>impose too great a restraint on trade and are oppressive to one
</p>
<p>j)artj without being of benefit to the other/
</p>
<p>It has often been held that an agreement in general restraint of
</p>
<p>trade is illegal and void. For a contract in restraint upon trade
</p>
<p>to be valid must not be general; the consideration must be
</p>
<p>adequate, not colorable, and the restriction must be reasonable;*
</p>
<p>so an agreement in general or total restraint of trade has been
</p>
<p>held to be void without regard to the consideration upon wliich
</p>
<p>it is founded. Such an agreement is one not to carry on a certain
</p>
<p>business anywhere, whether for a limited or unlimited time.*
</p>
<p>At a public auction, if the purpose be not to prevent competi-
</p>
<p>tion, nor this result likely to follow, one may bid as the agent of
</p>
<p>others;' but if made, or if it tend to stifle competition, the act is
</p>
<p>unlawful.*

<p>will neitlier of them give powers of attorney to anyone to vote

</p>
<p>So agreements or conditions imposed in the conveyance of real

<p>property, restricting its use to certain purposes, or excluding cer-

<p>or without sufficient consideration, or as creating and sustaining
</p>
<p>monopoly,''
</p>
<p>A contract entered into between a baker and a grocer, for a
</p>
<p>fixed payment of money, on conditions which would naturally
</p>
<p>tend to enhance the price of the baker's Ijread and render it a
</p>
<p>monopoly, is void as in restraint of trade. So are all agreements

<p>to create corners in grain, produce, etc."
</p>
<p>A contract entered into by the grain dealers of a town, the true

<p>object of which is to form a secret combination, which would

</p>
<p>Where one producer enters into a contract witli another pro-

<p>tlement with such persons except on the written consent of the
</p>
<p>others. Such a contract, while it restrains the parties from com-
</p>
<p>promising htigation, which is favored in law, also tends to the
</p>
<p>same evil consequences as attend the enforcement of a contract
</p>
<p>in restraint of trade ; ' but if the restraint be natural and not

<p>unreasonable for the protection of the parties it will be sus-

<p>tained. "
</p>
<p> 33. Contracts Imposing Limited Restraints Territorially
</p>
<p>as a Condition of Employment. Where the restraint con-
</p>
<p>tracted for appears to have been for a just and honest purpose,
</p>
<p>for the protection of the legitimate interests of the party in whose
</p>
<p>favor it is imposed, reasonable as between the parties and not
</p>
<p>.specially injurious to the public, the restraint will be held valid. '
</p>
<p>Thus a contract in restraint of trade as to a particular place is
</p>
<p>valid, * such as a contract not to engage in a particular trade or
</p>
<p>business in a certain place within a specified time. '
</p>
<p>A limit in space to the exercise of a trade, where there are rea-

<p>One may contract not to run steamboats on a particular river,

</p>
<p>An agreement that a steamer should not be used in the waters

<p>168 CONTKACTS IN RESTRAINT OF TKADK.
</p>
<p>A contract restraininaj a party from following a particular busi-
</p>
<p>ness in a designated city for five years is held valid, as the party
</p>
<p>may pursue any other employment in the same locality.'
</p>
<p>An agent of a wholesale house may contract not to sell his goods
</p>
<p>to but one purchaser in the towm.''
</p>
<p>A contract by a dealer in Kew Jersey not to ship poultry to
</p>
<p>New York or Washington has been held not to contain an un-
</p>
<p>reasonable restriction/
</p>
<p>An agreement not to sell marl off the vendor's land was held
</p>
<p>valid;* and so of an agreement not to manufacture goods in general;^
</p>
<p>so a restriction as to the use of a particular name in doing busi-
</p>
<p>ness for a period of five years is held reasonable, although the space
</p>
<p>is unlimited.'
</p>
<p>A tailor may limit his sphere of business by excluding himself
</p>
<p>from a space within ten miles of Charing Cross for three years.^
</p>
<p>All contracts in restraint of trade are not void; it is not against
</p>
<p>public policy for a person entering an employment to enter into a
</p>
<p>covenant restricted as to space not to carry on the same business in
</p>
<p>his own country, even if his employer should leave the business.
</p>
<p>The employer wishes to have security given to the business, not
</p>
<p>only while he is carrying it on himself, but in favor of his suc-
</p>
<p>cessors and during the whole life of the covenantor; and if reason-
</p>
<p>able when made, subsequent circumstances will not affect the
</p>
<p>operation of the contract under the rule as to contracts in restraint
</p>
<p>of trade.*
</p>
<p>One who on entering a merchant's employ covenants not to ei:
</p>
<p>gage in or carry on the same business within a mile of the shop at
</p>
<p>any future time, will be restrained from violation of his covenant,
</p>
<p>l)ecause the business was sold with its good will to another and re-
</p>
<p>moved to another shop, near by. The covenant was held to exist
</p>
<p>in favor of the purchaser and to bind the covenantor for his hfe.

</p>
<p>If the removal had been to a new neighborhood the result might
</p>
<p>have been otherwise. But the right of an employer to guard his
</p>
<p>business and his good will as an aiticle of value in the market was
</p>
<p>recognized as against those he took- into his employ, and thus af-
</p>
<p>forded them access to his customers and information as to the
</p>
<p>details of his business.'
</p>
<p>A contract in restraint of trade, made on good consideration and
</p>
<p>not extending beyond the obligee's sphere of actual business, is
</p>
<p>valid."
</p>
<p> 34. Territorial Limitations Sustained  Distance, how
</p>
<p>Determined  Instances.  A contract not to carry on a trade in
</p>
<p>a particular town or county is valid. * The question as to what is
</p>
<p>a general restraint of trade does not depend upon state lines; and
</p>
<p>a restraint is not necessarily general which embraces an entire
</p>
<p>State. Where such contract is made witli the purchaser and his
</p>
<p>assigns, his successor and assignee may maintain an action upon it;
</p>
<p>and the fact that the purchaser was a foreign corporation is no
</p>
<p>objection. *
</p>
<p>As to the section of the country which may be k^vfully covered,
</p>
<p>the following contracts have been held valid:  not to practice med-
</p>
<p>icine within 12 miles of a place ;^ not to practice as a physician in
</p>
<p>a particular town or its vicinity. Before a covenant not to prac-
</p>
<p>tice medicine in the neighborhood can be enforced, evidence must
</p>
<p>show the extent of the practice sold. '
</p>
<p>So one may agree not to engage in the business of iron casting
</p>
<p>within 60 miles of a certain place for ten years f not to run a
</p>
<p>stage on a certain route f not to set up business of apothecary

</p>
<p>within 20 miles of A ;* but restricting a dentist over a tei-ritorj of
</p>
<p>200 miles was held unreasonable."
</p>
<p>A contract, relating to a compound involving a secret in its prep-
</p>
<p>aration, based upon a valuable consideration, and limited as to
</p>
<p>the space within which, though unlimited as to the time for which
</p>
<p>the restraint is to operate, is reasonable and enforceal)le. ^ But
</p>
<p>restraining a solicitor from practice in England was sustained.*
</p>
<p>A contract applying to a particular place or section of the coun-
</p>
<p>try and leaving the major part open for the business is valid. ^
</p>
<p>A contract excluding a city and " vicinity" includes reasonably
</p>
<p>construed, a space of ten miles from the city limits ; or within a
</p>
<p>radius of ten miles of a town named. ''
</p>
<p>Under a contract not to carry on a business within a certain dis-
</p>
<p>tance, the mileage is to be measured in a straight line. *
</p>
<p>A contract not to carry on a business within a radius of ten
</p>
<p>miles of a village, means within a radius of ten miles of the cen-
</p>
<p>ter of such village. '
</p>
<p> 35. Limit of State Lines.  In this country, where state
</p>
<p>lines interpose so slight a barrier to business intercourse, the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of the United States seems much more inclined to treat
</p>
<p>a limitation, less^than the entire country, under certain conditions,
</p>
<p>as reasonable ;'" while state courts, limited to their state lines, have
</p>
<p>seemed unwilling that trade should be excluded from their juris-
</p>
<p>diction, or that a man should be compelled to transfer his resi-
</p>
<p>dence and allegiance to another State in order to pursue his

<p>A contract not to make printer's rollers in New York city, or

</p>
<p>conveyance of the estate.
</p>
<p>A restraint preventing a person from carrying on trade within
</p>
<p>a certain limit of space, though unlimited as to time, may be good,
</p>
<p>and the limit of space may be according to the nature of the con-
</p>
<p>tract. An instance of such a covenant being upheld is the case of
</p>
<p>Wilson V. Bart, L. K. 1 Ch. 463. In Catt v. Toicrle, L. E. 4 Ch.
</p>
<p>654, the court took judicial notice that the covenant is an extremely
</p>
<p>common one in favor of brewers upon a sale of land by them, that
</p>
<p>they shall have the exclusive right of supplying beer to any public
</p>
<p>house erected on the land,  that every court of justice has had
</p>
<p>occasion to consider these brewers' covenants, and must be taken
</p>
<p>to be cognizant of the distinction between what are called free
</p>
<p>public houses and brewers' public houses which are subject to this
</p>
<p>very covenant,  that it would be introducing very great uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty and confusion into a very large and important trade, if the
</p>
<p>court were to suggest any doubt as to the validity of a covenant
</p>
<p>so extremely common as this is. It was denied that there is any
</p>
<p>ground for the distinction, which has been suggested, that such a
</p>
<p>covenant might be good in a lease for 21, 50 or 100 years, but is
</p>
<p>not good if entered into as part of a transaction where the fee
</p>
<p>simple of property is conveyed.
</p>
<p>It was then suggested that at some future period of the cause,
</p>
<p>upon a motion, as in the case of Ifills v. Crvll, 2 Phil. 60, or at the
</p>
<p>hearing of the cause, circumstances might be shown which would
</p>
<p>render it improper for the court to interfere  it might be shown
</p>
<p>either that the plain tilf had placed himself in such a situation that
</p>
<p>he ought not to be allowed to exercise his right, or that the
</p>
<p>defendant had no notice of the covenant when he purchased the
</p>
<p>property; and then possibly Jlills v. Croll, 2 Phil. 60, might have
</p>
<p>some application, though it was suggested that it is very difficult
</p>
<p>to reconcile that case with Lxunley v. Wagner, 1 DeG. M. & G.
</p>
<p>604, which has been repeatedly followed; and if Hills v. Croll is
</p>
<p>to stand with that case at all, it can only be upon its particular

<p>unless it is taken as laying down that the court is to refuse to act
</p>
<p>in the negative, wherever there is a correlative obligation which it
</p>
<p>cannot enforce, it does not apply; if it is taken as going that length
</p>
<p>it is contrary to Lumleij v. Wagner, and must be considered as
</p>
<p>overruled; and he added: " Lastly, with respect to this cm^enant
</p>
<p>being invalid by reason of its being in restraint of trade," it does
</p>
<p>not go beyond the ordinary brewers' covenant except in this par-
</p>
<p>ticular, viz., that the ordinary brewers' covenant is generally
</p>
<p>between lessor and lessee or mortgagor and mortgagee, whereas
</p>
<p>the present covenant is between the vendor and purchaser of the
</p>
<p>fee; and this difference does not make the covenant void.
</p>
<p>So an agreement by the proprietor of a public garden, in con-
</p>
<p>sideration of a loan, to buy all his beer of the lender, so long
</p>
<p>as he should be willing to supply the same at the fair current
</p>
<p>market price thereof, is not a restraint of trade.'

</p>
<p>A party may legally purchase the trade and business of another

<p>is likely to lose a useful member of society in the one case and not
</p>
<p>in the other.
</p>
<p>It is clear that public policy and the interests of society favor
</p>
<p>the utmost freedom of trade within the law, and require that
</p>
<p>business transactions should not be trammeled by unnecessary
</p>
<p>restrictions. If tliere is one thing more than any other which
</p>
<p>public policy requires, it is that men of full age and competent
</p>
<p>understanding shall have the utmost liberty of c tutracting, and
</p>
<p>that contracts, when entered into freely and voluntarily, shall be
</p>
<p>held good, and shall be enforced by courts of justice.' It has
</p>
<p>sometimes been suggested that the doctrine that contracts in gen-
</p>
<p>eral restraint of trade are void, is founded, in part, upon the pol-
</p>
<p>icy of preventing monopolies, which are opposed to the liberty of
</p>
<p>the subject and the granting of which by the king, under claim
</p>
<p>of royal prerogative, led to conflicts memorable in Enghsh history.
</p>
<p>But a covenant that a person who sells the business of manu-
</p>
<p>facturing a particular article will not engage in the same business
</p>
<p>excepting in the capacity of agent or employe of the one to whom
</p>
<p>he sells within any of the several states of the United States or in
</p>
<p>the territories thereof, excepting and reserving, however, the
</p>
<p>right to manufacture and sell within a designated State and a
</p>
<p>Territory, operates simply to prevent the covenantor from engag-
</p>
<p>ing in the business which he sells, so as to protect the purchaser
</p>
<p>in the enjoyment of what he has purchased. ^
</p>
<p>The vendor is entitled to sell to the best advantage, and in so
</p>
<p>doing to exercise his right to preclude himself from entering into
</p>
<p>competition with the one who purchases, and the purchaser is entitled
</p>
<p>to such protection as is reasonably necessary to secui'e the full
</p>
<p>fruit of his investment. '
</p>
<p>To the extent that the contract prevents the vendor from carry-
</p>
<p>ing on a particular trade, it deprives the public of any benefit it
</p>
<p>may derive from his entering into competition; but the business
</p>
<p>is open to all others, and there is little danger that the public will
</p>
<p>suffer harm from lack of persons to engage in a profitable indus-

<p>special or exclusive privileges. If contracts in general restraint
</p>
<p>of trade (where the trade is general) are void as tending to monop-
</p>
<p>olies, contracts in partial restraint, where the trade is local, are
</p>
<p>subject to the same objection, because they deprive the local
</p>
<p>community of the services of a contractor in the particular trade
</p>
<p>or calling, and prevent his becoming a competitor with the cove-
</p>
<p>nantee.
</p>
<p>The motive of the covenantee is not, by any rule of law, made
</p>
<p>the test of the validity of such a contract. On the contrary, a
</p>
<p>party may legally purchase the contract and business of another,
</p>
<p>for the very purpose of preventing competition; and the validity
</p>
<p>of the contract, if supported by a consideration, will depend upon
</p>
<p>its reasonableness, as between the parties. Combinations between
</p>
<p>producers to limit production are or may be unlawful, but they
</p>
<p>stand on a different footing.'
</p>
<p>But the mere purchase of the "good will" will not be construed
</p>
<p>so as to prevent the seller from carrying on the same business in
</p>
<p>the same town.' Kor will a promise by merchants or dealers, not
</p>
<p>to purchase any particular article, produced in the immediate
</p>
<p>locality, from the makers for a term of years, as a consideration
</p>
<p>to induce a firm to open a store to deal in that particular article,

<p>be sustained. In Chaplin v. Brown (Iowa) 12 L. R. A. 428, the

<p>appeal was by plaintiffs from a judgment of the district court in
</p>
<p>favor of defendants in an action brought to recover damages for
</p>
<p>defendants' breach of their agreement not to engage in the busi-
</p>
<p>ness of buying butter in a certain place, and to enjoin the further
</p>
<p>breach of such agreement. It appears from the petition that in
</p>
<p>the month of March, 1890, the plaintiffs entered into a written
</p>
<p>agreement with the defendants and other parties. The following
</p>
<p>is a copy of said agreement:

<p>will engage in the business extensively in our town, we make a
</p>
<p>solemn engagement and pledge ourselves to each other and to the
</p>
<p>said firm of D. & E. Chaplin that we will buy no more butter or
</p>
<p>take no more in trade, except for our family use, and all butter so
</p>
<p>bought shall be delivered by the seller to the buyer's place of res-
</p>
<p>idence. This, however, shall not prevent any merchant from
</p>
<p>buying butter to retail from any regular butter buyer who buys
</p>
<p>all the butter he handles in this town for cash. It is further pro-
</p>
<p>vided that the said firm of J). & E. Chaplin, in whose favor we
</p>
<p>abandon the business, shall open rooms conveniently located for
</p>
<p>buying butter; that they shall keep a man in attendance during
</p>
<p>all business days and hours in the year from as early in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing and until as late in the evening as tlie season of the year and
</p>
<p>state of the weather might seem to require. They shall accept
</p>
<p>all the butter offered, and shall pay for the same as high price in
</p>
<p>cash, or by giving check against a suitable deposit in some bank
</p>
<p>in this town, as merchants or butter buyers in the town of JSTewell,
</p>
<p>this county, are at the time paying in cash for a similar grade of
</p>
<p>butter, except in extreme cases, where they may be paying ma-
</p>
<p>terially more than the markets will warrant. It is also provided
</p>
<p>that the said D. & E. Chaplin shall not direct their checks or
</p>
<p>persons taking the same to any particular store for payment.
</p>
<p>That they shall not buy in connection with any dry goods or gro-
</p>
<p>cery store. Whenever a majority of the merchants signing this
</p>
<p>article of agreement are convinced that the engagements herein-
</p>
<p>entered into are not being complied with, or whenever they are
</p>
<p>dissatisfied with this arrangement or the manner in which it is
</p>
<p>being carried out, any merchant whose name is hereto appended
</p>
<p>may appoint a meeting by notifying each grocery firm in town of
</p>
<p>the time and place for the purpose of considering who may be
</p>
<p>guilty of a breach of faith in carrying out these engagements, or

<p>whether it is advisable to continue the same; and if, at such meet-
</p>

</p>
<p>that they think it advisable for the interest of the town to with-

<p>draw from this engagement, this contract shall become null and

<p>grocery house in this town, and when the firm of D. & E. Chap-
</p>
<p>lin shall designate, provided they are then prepared to handle the
</p>
<p>butter, and shall continue two (2) years unless sooner dissolved, as
</p>
<p>herein provided. We also agree not to pay a higher price for

</p>
<p>It is averred in the petition that the plaintiffs, in pursuance of
</p>
<p>said written contract, came and located at Storm Lake, and en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the business of buying butter at that place, and were at
</p>
<p>the commencement of the suit still so engaged, and have made
</p>
<p>arrangements to continue the business for the said period of two
</p>
<p>years, and that they have thus far fully complied with said written
</p>
<p>agreement, but that the defendants, in violation thereof, have
</p>
<p>opened a butter store in said town, and have engp.,ged in the busi-
</p>
<p>ness of buying butter generally, and have thereby interfered with
</p>
<p>plaintiffs' business, and alienated their trade to the extent of 5,000
</p>
<p>pounds of butter, upon which plaintiffs would have realized a
</p>
<p>profit of three cents a pound, making in all $150 damages suf-
</p>
<p>fered by plaintiffs. Judgment is demanded for said sum, and an
</p>
<p>injunction is prayed restraining the defendants from continuing
</p>
<p>in said business.
</p>
<p>Among the several grounds of objection to the granting of an
</p>
<p>injunction the court considered two of them as material. They
</p>
<p>are as follows: ^rst, that the agreement in writing is void for
</p>
<p>want of consideration, as there is no money value inuring to the
</p>
<p>benefit of the defendants herein; and, second, that said contract
</p>
<p>by its terms is for the purpose of creating a monopoly in purchas-
</p>
<p>ing and selling butter at Storm Lake, and is therefore in restraint
</p>
<p>of trade to the detriment of the producers and consumers of but-
</p>
<p>ter at that place and in that vicinity.
</p>
<p>In passing upon these objections it is said that the history of

</p>
<p>the law upon the question of contracts in restraint of trade is an
</p>
<p>interesting subject of investigation. The books abound in cases
</p>
<p>upon the subject. Anciently all contracts were void which in any
</p>
<p>degree tended to the restraint of trade, even in a particular local-
</p>
<p>180 CONTRA.CTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADK.
</p>
<p>ity, and for a limited time. This ancient rule has been so far
</p>
<p>modified that, although agreements in general restraint of trade
</p>
<p>are invalid, because they deprive the public of the services of the
</p>
<p>citizen in the occupation or calling in which he is most useful to
</p>
<p>the community, and expose the people to the evils of monopoly,
</p>
<p>and prevent competition in trade, yet an agreement in partial
</p>
<p>restraint of trade will be upheld where the restriction does not go
</p>
<p>beyond some particular locality, is founded upon a sufficient con-
</p>
<p>sideration, and is limited as to time, place and person. It is ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly everywhere now held tliat when one engaged in any
</p>
<p>business or occupation sells out his stock in trade and good will
</p>
<p>he may make a valid contract with the purchaser binding himself
</p>
<p>not to engage in the same business in the same place for a time
</p>
<p>named, and he may be enjoined and rcetrained from violating his
</p>
<p>contract. This is about as far as contracts in restraint of trade
</p>
<p>have been upheld by the courts in this country or in England.
</p>
<p>Tlie general principles above announced will be found in all text-
</p>
<p>books upon contracts, and find support in many adjudged cases.
</p>
<p>Applying these rules to the contract under consideration, the
</p>
<p>inquiry is made first whether there is a sufficient consideration for
</p>
<p>the promise of the defendants and the other parties who executed
</p>
<p>the instrument not to engage in dealing in butter at Storm Lake. It
</p>
<p>is said that it is very plain that there was no money paid to them
</p>
<p>as a consideration. The plaintiffs did not purchase any stock of
</p>
<p>butter which the defendants had on hand. They paid nothing
</p>
<p>for an established plant or place of doing business, nor for the
</p>
<p>good will of any business. So far as appears, they went into the
</p>
<p>town and proposed to go into the butter business if the other
</p>
<p>persons then engaged in that business would agree to quit that
</p>
<p>line of trade for two years. JSTo warrant is found by the court in
</p>
<p>any precedent for holding that this is a sufficient consideration.
</p>
<p>There are cases which hold, and the law is well settled, that where
</p>
<p>a party proposes to expend money in erecting a manufactory or
</p>
<p>other plant which may be a public benefit, subscriptions in aid of

</p>
<p>the enterprise are valid obligations. But such contracts are wide-
</p>
<p>ly different in principle from the agreement under consideration.
</p>
<p>Suppose the plaintiffs had made a proposition to the dry-goods
</p>
<p>merchants that if they would all quit the business for two years,
</p>
<p>SALE OF JJISCOVEUV. Ibi
</p>
<p>without any consideration being paid to them for so doing, the
</p>
<p>plaintiffs would establish a dry-goods store at tliat place, and the
</p>
<p>proposition had been accepted ; it would be a marvelous decision
</p>
<p>if any court would hold that there was an}^ consideration for such
</p>
<p>a contract.
</p>
<p>The court also declared that the decision of the district court
</p>
<p>is manifestly right upon the question that the agreement is against
</p>
<p>public policy. It plainly tends to monopolize the butter trade of
</p>
<p>that locality, and destroy competition in that business. It is not
</p>
<p>necessary that the enforcement of the agreement would actually
</p>
<p>create a monopoly in order to render it invalid, and surely, where
</p>
<p>all the dealers in a commodity in a certain locality agree to quit
</p>
<p>the business, and the plaintiffs are installed as the only dealers in
</p>
<p>that line, the tendency is, for a time at least, to destroy competi-
</p>
<p>tion, and leave the plaintiffs as the only dealers in that species of
</p>
<p>property in that locality. It was accordingly held that such con-
</p>
<p>tracts could not be enforced.
</p>
<p>!N^or will a contract between a purchaser of a stock in a manu-
</p>
<p>factory, with the machinery, materials, tools and good will, be
</p>
<p>sustained, where it excludes the seller from engaging in the busi-
</p>
<p>ness in an unreasonably extensive territory, and does not occupy
</p>
<p>the held itself, being a foreign corporation, and excludes the use
</p>
<p>of the premises for the same manufacturing purposes for a period
</p>
<p>of five years.'

<p>exercise the right to preclude himself from entering into compe-
</p>
<p>tition with those who purchase the secret from hinl.^

<p>182 CONTRACTS IJST RESTRAINT OF TRADE.
</p>
<p>Such a contract, relating to a compound invoh-ing a secret in
</p>
<p>its preparation, based upon a valuable consideration, and limited
</p>
<p>as to the space within which, though unlimited as to the time for
</p>
<p>which the restraint is to operate, is reasonable and enforceable.
</p>
<p>Where one has and transfers property in the secret process of
</p>
<p>manufacturing an article he has discovered, he and his grantees
</p>
<p>can claim relief as against breaches of trust in respect to it.
</p>
<p>The policy of the law is to encourage useful discoveries by
</p>
<p>securing their fruits to those who make them.
</p>
<p>A contract in regard to the manner in which the parties shall
</p>
<p>exercise their alleged patent-rights, under which they make con-
</p>
<p>flicting claims, and which contract has reference merely to the
</p>
<p>manufacture of goods under the specified patents,  is not void
</p>
<p>because in restriction of trade.'
</p>
<p>An agreement authorized by each member of an association, by
</p>
<p>which an owner of a patented process is to confine the sale and
</p>
<p>use thereof to the members of the association, each of which is to
</p>
<p>pay a percentage on the manufactured articles, no member being
</p>
<p>responsible for anything but his own work, and there being no
</p>
<p>community of profits and losses.  is not a contract in restraint of
</p>
<p>trade, although there is no agreement on the part of any of the
</p>
<p>members to use the machinery at all, or as to the amount of the
</p>
<p>articles they will offer for sale."
</p>
<p>The public are only interested in securing the preparation and
</p>
<p>not in the vendors, and the latter is entitled to exclude competi-
</p>
<p>tion from his grantor or from those to whom he may sell within
</p>
<p>a reasonable territory unless they intend indeed to occupy the
</p>
<p>entire field.^
</p>
<p>The contract does not deprive the public of the benefit of tliis
</p>
<p>secret nor is any party, possessing the secret, debarred from its
</p>
<p>use. They are simply circumscribed as to the territory within
</p>
<p>which they may sell.*

</p>
<p> 41. Monopoly Secured to a Patent Right.  A limited
</p>
<p>inonopoly secured by a patent granted for a new discovery or
</p>
<p>invention is an admitted exception to the general rule against
</p>
<p>monopolies, for this is the only way the inventor can be paid and
</p>
<p>it is adopted as a matter of public policy to encourage discovery.
</p>
<p>A contract not to aid, assist or encourage, in any manner, com-
</p>
<p>petition against purchasers of patents of twists, drills and collets,
</p>
<p>wae held valid in a suit to restrain defendants from violating it
</p>
<p>by making the articles in another State and selling them in the
</p>
<p>restricted market. As the business was not local the restraint
</p>
<p>was regarded as only reasonable protection.*
</p>
<p>A contract between an individual and three manufacturers
</p>
<p>under several patents forming a combination of the parties, with
</p>
<p>a view to regulate competition between the parties to it in the
</p>
<p>sale of the particular commodity which they severally make, is a
</p>
<p>contract for a lawful purpose where it does not refer to an article
</p>
<p>of prime necessity, to a staple of commerce, or to a merchandise
</p>
<p>to be bought or sold on the market.*
</p>
<p>In Jones v. Lees^ 1 Hurlst. & JS'. 189, a covenant by the defend-
</p>
<p>ant, a licensee under a patent, that he would not, during the
</p>
<p>license, make or sell any slubbing machines unless the invention
</p>
<p>of the plaintiif applied to them, was held valid. A contract for
</p>
<p>the exclusive right to supply a certain district with flour prepared
</p>
<p>under a certain patent, for a royalty, is not invalid.'
</p>
<p>An assignment of the sole right to make, use and vend a cer-
</p>
<p>tain patented article for a certain time " within the southern half
</p>
<p>of Alabama, less Chambers County," is not void for uncertainty
</p>
<p>as to the territory.*
</p>
<p>But contracts between holders of patents are often sustained
</p>
<p>upon the ground that the contract is reasonable in itself, leaving
</p>
<p>out of view the question of monopoly rightly yielded to a patent
</p>
<p>invention. In a case decided in Massachusetts June 25, 1891,*

</p>
<p>patent owned bv the plaintiff, believing that they would be able
</p>
<p>to practically control the profitable manufacture of fish glue,
</p>
<p>entered into a contract with each other by which the defendant
</p>
<p>was to pay a certain sum for damages and <ne half of the costs of
</p>
<p>the suits, and to be allowed the use of the patent. Each party
</p>
<p>was to conduct its own establishment and they were to unite in the
</p>
<p>purchase of fish skins, an article of which the su])ply was limited
</p>
<p>and from which the fish glue is manufactured, so that there should
</p>
<p>be no competition between them. The plaintiff was to fix the
</p>
<p>price of all skins purchased, the parties were to have certain places
</p>
<p>assigned to them by two persons named, of which they were
</p>
<p>respectively to have the product; from the proprietors of certain
</p>
<p>other places mentioned the defendant was to have the entire pro-
</p>
<p>duct and to allow the plaintiff" to receive from it one third thereof,
</p>
<p>and the two parties were to divide equally between them the
</p>
<p>skins which might be obtained from new producers. They were
</p>
<p>both to sell the glue at the same price, to be agreed upon from
</p>
<p>time to time, and the contract contained other stipulations, the
</p>
<p>effect of which was to prevent competition between them. The
</p>
<p>contract was made in February, 1884. After they had conducted
</p>
<p>the business in this manner until early in 188Y, it became evident
</p>
<p>to both that the patent was invalid, although no formal judgment
</p>
<p>was rendered declaring it so. Thereupon, Mr. Brooks, the man-
</p>
<p>ager of the defendant company, made a large number of what are
</p>
<p>known as the long term contracts for the purchase of all skins to
</p>
<p>be produced until the year 1900, with nearly all the producers of
</p>
<p>fish skins known to the parties. The plaintiff received its share
</p>
<p>of these skins and no difficulty arose between the two companies,
</p>
<p>until early in July, 1890, when the defendant notified the pro-
</p>
<p>ducers of skins by whom the plaintiff had been supplied up to
</p>
<p>that time not to deliver it any more skins, and notified the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff' of its abandonment of the contract. Until then the parties
</p>
<p>had gone along under the contract as modified by mutual consent,
</p>
<p>and no intimation had been given the plaintiff of any intention to

</p>
<p>abandon it. The object of the bill is to compel the defendant to
</p>
<p>permit the plaintiff to obtain directly from the producers, or
</p>
<p>through the defendant, what it deems its share of the fish skins.
</p>
<p>The defendant contends that the contract as originally made was.
</p>
<p>void as contrary to public policy.
</p>
<p>MONOPOLY SECUKED TO A PATENT KIGHT. 185
</p>
<p>But in considering this contention the court says that the orig-
</p>
<p>inal purpose of the contract Avas to regulate the business of man-
</p>
<p>ufacturing a product under what was supposed to be a new
</p>
<p>invention on which letters patent of the United States had been
</p>
<p>issued, whereby an article then nearly worthless might be con-
</p>
<p>verted into an article of large value. The use to which the fish skins
</p>
<p>were put under this invention gave them tlieir market value.
</p>
<p>The plaintiff and defendant sought to unite with each other in
</p>
<p>the purchase of the raw material, so that they might not be
</p>
<p>tempted to overbid each other and thus to raise it to an unreason-
</p>
<p>able price, and also to agree on the price at which the manufac-
</p>
<p>tured article should be sold so that they might be secure in a.
</p>
<p>reasonable profit. Even if they hoped for gain by their joint exer-
</p>
<p>tions or by the possession of a patent as to the vahie of which they
</p>
<p>were subsequently disappointed, their contract had no relation to
</p>
<p>an article of prime necessity, or to staple commodities ordinarily
</p>
<p>bought and sold in the market, but to a particular article of which
</p>
<p>both were manufacturers under the same process, and to an article
</p>
<p>used in the manufacture which was of little value for any other
</p>
<p>use; that the agreement was not obnoxious to the objection made
</p>
<p>by the defendant is shown by the case of Central Shade Roller

<p>they might contract with it instead of with each other, and carry
</p>
<p>out their scheme through its agency instead of that of a pre-exist-
</p>
<p>ing person, it is said is obviously immaterial, and the only ground
</p>
<p>upon which it can be argued that the contract is invalid is the
</p>
<p>restraint it puts upon the parties to it.
</p>
<p>The court then inquires whether the contract imposes a restraint
</p>
<p>as to the manufacture or the sale of balance shade rollers, which
</p>
<p>is void as against public policy, and concludes that the contract
</p>
<p>certainly puts no restraint upon the production of the commodity
</p>
<p>to which it relates. It puts no obligation upon and offers no
</p>
<p>inducement to any person to produce less than to the full extent
</p>
<p>of his capacity. On the contrary, its apparent purpose is, by
</p>
<p>making prices more uniform and regular, to stimulate and increase
</p>
<p>production. The contract does not restrict the sale of the com-
</p>
<p>modity. It does not look toward withholding a supply from the
</p>
<p>market, in order to enhance the price, as in Craft v. McConougJuj,
</p>
<p>79 111. 346, and other cases to the same effect. On the con-
</p>
<p>trary, the contract intends that the parties shall make sales, and
</p>
<p>gives them full power to do so, the only restrictions being that
</p>
<p>sales, not at retail or for export, shall be in the name of the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff and reported to it, and the accounts of them kept by it, and
</p>
<p>the provision that when any party shall establish an agency in
</p>
<p>any city or town for the sale of a roller made exclusively for that
</p>
<p>purpose, no other party shall take orders for the same roller in the
</p>
<p>same place. To these restrictions, clearly valid, there is added the
</p>
<p>one which affords an argument for the invalidity of the contract
</p>
<p> the restriction as to price. That restriction is, in su1)stance,
</p>
<p>that the price for rollers of the same grade, made by different
</p>
<p>parties, shall be the same, and shaU be according to a schedule
</p>
<p>contained in the contract, subject to changes which may be made
</p>
<p>by the plaintiff" upon recommendation of three fourths of its stock-
</p>
<p>holders. This the court regards as in effect an agreement between
</p>
<p>three makers of a commodity that for three years they will sell it
</p>
<p>at a uniform price, lixed at the outset, and to be changed only by

</p>
<p>consent of a majority of them. The agreement does not refer to
</p>
<p>an article of prime necessity, nor to a staple of commerce, nor to
</p>
<p>merchandise to be bought and sold in the market, but to a par-
</p>
<p>ticular curtain fixture of the parties' own manufacture. It does

<p>MONOPOLY SECURED TO A PATENT RIGHT. 187
</p>
<p>not look to affecting: competition from outside (the parties have a
</p>
<p>monopoly bj their patents), but only to restrict competition in
</p>
<p>price between themselves. Even if such an agreement tends to
</p>
<p>raise the price of the commodity it is one which the parties have
</p>
<p>a right to make. To hold otherwise would be to impair the right
</p>
<p>of persons to make contracts and to put a price on the products of
</p>
<p>their own industry. But, it is said, we cannot assume that the
</p>
<p>purpose and effect of the coml)iuation is to unduly raise the price
</p>
<p>of the commodity. A natural purpose and a natural effect is to
</p>
<p>maintain a fair and uniform price, and to prevent the injurious
</p>
<p>effects, both to producers and consumers, of fluctuating prices
</p>
<p>caused by undue competition. When it appears that the com-
</p>
<p>bination is used to the public detriment, a different question will
</p>
<p>be presented. The contract is apparently beneficial to the parties
</p>
<p>to the combination, and not necessarily injurious to the public,
</p>
<p>and it is denied that there is any autliority or reason for holding

<p>then present conditions of commercial and social life, it of neces-

<p>the inclination of modern thought and of the decisions, has been

<p>no longer to uphold in its strictness the doctrine which formerlj

<p>prevailed in respect of agreements in restraint of trade. The
</p>
<p>severity with which such agreements were at first treated became
</p>
<p>more and more relaxed by exceptions and qualifications. This
</p>
<p>change was gradual and may be considered, perhaps, as due mainly
</p>
<p>to and as keeping even pace with tlie growth and spread of the
</p>
<p>industrial activities of the world and enlarged commercial facili-

<p>ties, which render such agreements less dangerous as tending to

<p>create monopolies. The earlier doctrine, of course, obtained in

<p>became imposed was that the agreement should operate as to a.

<p>danger in such agreements seems only necessarily to exist when
</p>
<p>corporations are parties to them; for their means and strength
</p>
<p>would usually better enable them to buy off rivalry and to create
</p>
<p>monopolies.
</p>
<p>In 1844, a statute was passed in Parliament wliieh removed
</p>
<p>many of the cumbersome provisions regarding contracts supposed
</p>
<p>to be restrictive of trade. The Act was as follows:
</p>
<p>"An Act for Abolishing the Offenses of Forestalling, Regrat-
</p>
<p>ing, and Engrossing, and for Repealing Certain Statutes Passed in
</p>
<p>Restraint of Trade.
</p>
<p>"Whereas divers statutes liave been from time to time made in
</p>
<p>the parliaments of England, Scotland, Great Britain and Ireland
</p>
<p>respectively prohibiting certain dealings in wares, victuals, mer-
</p>
<p>'Chandise, and various commodities by the names of badgering,
</p>
<p>forestalling, regrating, and engrossing, and subjecting to divers
</p>
<p>punishments, penalties, and forfeitures, persons so dealing; and
</p>
<p>"Wliereas it is expedient that such statutes, as well as certain
</p>
<p>other statutes made in hindrance and in restraint of trade, be re-
</p>
<p>pealed; and
</p>
<p>"Whereas an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain was passed
</p>
<p>in the twelfth year of the reign of King George the Third, inti-
</p>
<p>tuled 'An Act for repealing several laws therein mentioned against
</p>
<p>badgers, engrossers, forestallers and regraters, and for indemnify-
</p>
<p>ing persons against prosecutions for offenses committed against the
</p>
<p>said acts,' whereby after reciting that it had been found by ex-
</p>
<p>perience that the restraint laid by several statutes upon the deal-
</p>
<p>ing in corn, meal, flour, cattle, and sundry other sorts of victuals,
</p>
<p>by preventing a free trade in the said commodities, have a ten-
</p>
<p>dency to discourage the growth and to enhance the price of the
</p>
<p>ame, which statutes, if put in execution, would bring great dis-
</p>
<p>tress upon the inhabitants of many parts of this kingdom, and in
</p>
<p>particular upon those of the cities of London and Westminster,
</p>
<p>sundry acts therein mentioned, and all the acts made for the bet-

<p> 43. Modern Doctrine that Restraint is Valid, if Co-ex-
</p>
<p>tensive only with Interest to he Protected and with Benefit
</p>
<p>Meant to be Conferred.  The tendency of recent adjudications
</p>
<p>is to conform to the spirit which induced such modified legislation
</p>
<p>and it is now clearly marked in the direction of relaxing the rigor
</p>
<p>of the doctrine that all contracts in general restraint of trade are
</p>
<p>void, irrespective of special circumstances. Indeed, it has of late
</p>
<p>been denied that a hard and unjust rule of that kind has ever
</p>
<p>been the law of England.*
</p>
<p>The law has for centuries permitted contracts in restraint of
</p>
<p>trade when reasonable, and in Horner v. Crafts^ 7 Bing. 735,
</p>

<p>MODERN DOCTRINE THAT RESTRAINT IS VALID. 195
</p>
<p>contract is not as reasonable as when the interest is partial, and
</p>
<p>there is a corresponding partial restraint. There is no public
</p>
<p>reason which necessarily condemns the one and not the other.'
</p>
<p>The doctrine relating to contracts in restraint of trade has been
</p>
<p>elaVjoratelv discussed in a careful opinion of Andrews, /., in the
</p>
<p>recent case of Diamond Match Co. v. Roeber, 9 Cent. Rep. 181,
</p>
<p>106 N. Y. 473. Under the authority of that case it may be said
</p>
<p>that no contracts are void as being in general restraint of trade
</p>
<p>where they operate simply to prevent a party from engaging or
</p>
<p>competing in the same business. To the extent that the contract
</p>
<p>prevents the vendor from carrying on the particular trade, it
</p>
<p>deprives the community of any beneiit it might derive from his
</p>
<p>entering into competition. But the business is open to all others,
</p>
<p>and there is little danger that the public will suffer harm from
</p>
<p>lack of persons to engage in a protital)le industry. Such contracts
</p>
<p>do not create monopolies. They confer no special or exclusive
</p>
<p>privileges.
</p>
<p>A contract in restraint of trade, made on good consideration
</p>
<p>and not extending beyond the obligee's sphere of actual business,
</p>
<p>is valid."
</p>
<p>A covenant in restraint of trade is valid if it imposes no
</p>
<p>restriction upon one party which is not beneficial to the other,
</p>
<p>and was induced by a consideration which made it reasonable for
</p>
<p>the parties to enter into it, or, in other words, if it was a proj^er
</p>
<p>and useful contract, or such as could not be disregarded without
</p>
<p>injury to a fair contractor.'
</p>
<p>This is the doctrine of Chappel v. Brockioay., 21 Wend. 157,
</p>
<p>derived from the leading case of Mitchel v. Reynolds., 1 P.^V'ms.
</p>
<p>181, and an examination of subsequent decisions. It is also
</p>
<p>amplified and discussed in Diamond Match Co. v. Roeler, 9
</p>
<p>Cent. Eep. 181, 106 ^. Y. 473.
</p>
<p>It is an encouragement to industry and enterprise in building
</p>
<p>up a trade, that a man may thereafter be permitted to sell the
</p>
<p>good will of the bu^^iness and the fruits of his industry upon the

<p>tinent, public policy does not forind his accompanyins^ the sale
</p>
<p>with a stipulation for restraint co-extensive with the business
</p>
<p>which he sells.
</p>
<p>Contracts in restraint of trade will be valid, when the restric-
</p>
<p>tion is not larger and wider than the protection of the party with
</p>
<p>whom the contract is made can possibly require.'
</p>
<p>It has been said that all the cases when they come to be
</p>
<p>examined seem to establish this principle: that all restraints upon
</p>
<p>trade are bad as being in violation of public policy, unless they
</p>
<p>are natural and not unreasonable for the protection of the parties
</p>
<p>dealing legally with some subject matter of contract. The prin-
</p>
<p>ciple is that public policy requires that every man should not be
</p>
<p>at liberty to deprive himself, or the public, of his labor, skill or
</p>
<p>talent, by any contract that he enters into. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>public policy recognizes that when a man has by skill, or by any
</p>
<p>other means, obtained something which he wants to sell, he should
</p>
<p>be at perfect liberty to sell it to the greatest advantage to him-
</p>
<p>self, and in order to enable him to effect such sale, and secure the
</p>
<p>full value, it may be, in the particular case, with regard to the
</p>
<p>subject matter, necessary that he should be able to preclude him-
</p>
<p>self from entering into competition with the purchaser. In such
</p>
<p>case the same public policy enables him to enter into any stipu-
</p>
<p>lation, however restrictive it is, provided the restriction, in the
</p>
<p>judgment of the court, is not unreasonable, having regard to the
</p>
<p>subject matter of the contract and trade conditions."

<p>PUBLIC rOLICY CONCERNING TEADE RESTKICTIONS. 197
</p>
<p>A contract restraining one competent to instruct in the German
</p>
<p>and French language, for a year after his employment ends,
</p>
<p>within the limit of a State, is nnreasonable, as beyond any appar-
</p>
<p>ently necessary protection to his employer, unless it be shown
</p>
<p>otherwise/
</p>
<p> 44. Public Policy Conceniing Trade Restrictions.  In-
</p>
<p>deed what public policy requires is often vague and difficult to
</p>
<p>determine. The recognition of public policy, independently of
</p>
<p>statutory regulation, as a test of the validity of contracts, is, at
</p>
<p>best, the establishment of a very uncertain rule," and the test of
</p>
<p>public policy is to be applied with the greatest caution.^
</p>
<p>Public policy is in its nature so uncertain and fluctuating 
</p>
<p>varying with the habits and fashions of the day, with the growth
</p>
<p>of commerce and the usages of trade  that it is difficult to detect
</p>
<p>its limits with any degree of exactness. It has never been defined
</p>
<p>by the courts but has been left loose and free from definition in
</p>
<p>the same manner as fraud. This rule may however be safely laid
</p>
<p>down that, wherever any contract conflicts with the morals of the
</p>
<p>time, and contravenes any established interest of society, it is
</p>
<p>void, as being against public policy. The immediate representa-
</p>
<p>tives of the people in Legislature assembled would seem to be the
</p>
<p>fairest exponent of what public policy requires, as being most
</p>
<p>familiar with the habits and fashions of the day and with the
</p>
<p>actual condition of commerce and trade, and their consequent
</p>
<p>wants and weaknesses. Legislation is least objectionable because
</p>
<p>it operates prospectively as a guide to future transactions, and
</p>
<p>does not, like the judgment of a court, annul a contract already
</p>
<p>concluded.

</p>
<p>What is injurious to the rights of citizens slioiild, it would
</p>
<p>seem, be the sul)ject of positive legislation, rather than the doubt-
</p>
<p>ful judgment of a court.'
</p>
<p>For this reason courts are reluctant to extend the prohibitions
</p>
<p>of the common law, except where the public interest imperatively
</p>
<p>requires it."
</p>
<p>In all cases where the legislative judgment has been expressed,
</p>
<p>courts are bound by the j^olicy thus declared. Where the statute
</p>
<p>declares that no one shall vote at a stockholders' meeting upon a
</p>
<p>power of attorney not executed witliin the year previous to the
</p>
<p>jneeting, the statute discloses that the policy of the State is opposed
</p>
<p>to a surrender of the voting power by stockholders, for an indefin-
</p>
<p>ite period or for a term of five years, and a voting trust for such
</p>
<p>a time was therefore held illegal.*
</p>
<p> 45. Examples of Modern Rule Regarding Restrictions. 
</p>
<p>That the general tendency of recent judicial opinion is to limit
</p>
<p>the ap23lication of the rule that contracts in restraint of trade are
</p>
<p>void, is shown by the many authorities.*
</p>
<p>In Whittaler v. Ilouie, 3 Beav. 333, a contract made by a solic-
</p>
<p>itor, not to practice as a solicitor in any part of Great Britain,
</p>
<p>was held valid.
</p>
<p>A union formed among dealers in tol)acco, the purpose and
</p>
<p>result of which is to arbitrarily fix the price, and destroy individ-
</p>
<p>ual discretion, is illegal as an elfort to strangle comj^etition out-
</p>
<p>right and breed monopolies.'*

</p>
<p>In RousiUon v. lionsillon a general contract not to engage in
</p>
<p>the sale of champagne, without limit as to space, was enforced, as
</p>
<p>being, under the circumstances, a reasonable contract.
</p>
<p>In Jones v. Lees, 1 Hurlst. & 1^. 189, a covenant by the defend-
</p>
<p>ant, a licensee under a patent, that he would not, during the license,
</p>
<p>make or sell any slubbing machines, without the invention of the
</p>
<p>plaintiff applied to them, was held valid. Bramwell, ?/., said : " It
</p>
<p>is objected that the restraint extends to all England, but so does
</p>
<p>tlie privilege."
</p>
<p>An agreement between a corporation and its stockholders, that
</p>
<p>the latter should not pm-chase goods of a certain class, during a
</p>
<p>limited period, of anyone other than the members of an associa-
</p>
<p>tion with which that corporation had entered into a contract,
</p>
<p>resulting in benefits to itself and members, is not in restraint of
</p>
<p>trade.'
</p>
<p>The question as to what is a general restraint of trade is not to
</p>
<p>be determined by the fact that it includes all the territory within
</p>
<p>state lines; and a restraint is not necessarily general which
</p>
<p>-embraces an entire State. Where such contract is made with the
</p>
<p>purchaser and his assigns, his successor and assignee may maintain
</p>
<p>an action upon it ; and the fact that the purchaser was a foreign
</p>
<p>corporation is no objection. And the use of a name may be con-
</p>
<p>trolled.'
</p>
<p>Thus a covenant not to carry on the business of a manufacturer
</p>
<p>anywhere for a period of five years under a particular name or
</p>
<p>style is not void.'
</p>
<p>An agreement by a particular individual or firm not to manu-
</p>
<p>facture goods in general has been enforced."
</p>
<p>A contract restraining the exercise of a trade within a limited
</p>
<p>locality, when there is reasonable ground for the restriction, may
</p>
<p>be valid ; and if the restriction seem reasonable, its adequacy as a
</p>
<p>-consideration will not be inquired into.*

</p>
<p>A covenant not to be directly or indirectly interested in any
</p>
<p>voyage to the northwest coast of America, or in any traffic witli
</p>
<p>the natives of that coast, for seven years, was held valid. In that
</p>
<p>case some weight was given to the obligation of a trust.'
</p>
<p>A contract by a steamship corporation to purchase a competing
</p>
<p>line, which, in consideration thereof, agrees to discontinue run-
</p>
<p>ning vessels between ports mentioned, and not to charter or sell
</p>
<p>their vessels for use on that route, and not to become in any way
</p>
<p>interested in the running of steamships between those places, is
</p>
<p>not void as in restraint of trade.*
</p>
<p>In Oregon Steam Nav. Go. v. Winsor, 87 U. S. 20 Wall. 64, 2^
</p>
<p>L. ed. 315, the court enforced the covenant by the defendant
</p>
<p>made in the purchase of a steamship, that it should not be run or
</p>
<p>employed in the freight or passenger business in the waters of
</p>
<p>the State of California for a period of ten years ; cont/'a, where
</p>
<p>no time was fixed.'
</p>
<p>Where the covenant is partial and not general, it will not bo a
</p>
<p>good objection that it is practically unlimited as to time.*
</p>
<p>In each particular case the surrounding circumstances are to
</p>
<p>be considered in determining whether the covenant will operate
</p>
<p>as a restraint, injurious to the public* Thus an exclusive right
</p>
<p>to* lay tubing for the conveyance of oil through an extensive tract,
</p>
<p>which would practically deny this facility to others, was held to
</p>
<p>be illegal.*
</p>
<p>An agreement not to engage in a particular business in a cer-
</p>
<p>tain town for five years, is sustained as being only a limited
</p>
<p>restraint upon trade.''

<p>not to re-en2:aa;e in the identical business in the same place for
</p>
<p>three years, after the expiration of that time lie was not debarred
</p>
<p>from soliciting the agencj of the same lands he had in charge
</p>
<p>when the contract was made.'
</p>
<p>And acting on this principle it is held that an agreement not
</p>
<p>to sell milk in a particular town is not violated by selling to one
</p>
<p>residing outside the town, with knowledge that the purchaser
</p>
<p>intends to retail the milk within the town.^
</p>
<p>There are many illustrations of the application of the rule to
</p>
<p>special cases, a few of which are given below/
</p>
<p> 4fi. Legality of Consideration, and Reasonableness of
</p>
<p>Restriction  Questions of Law.  Whether a contract is in
</p>
<p>restraint of trade or not is a question of law for the court and not
</p>
<p>a question of fact for the jury.* Contracts in restraint of trade
</p>
<p>where no consideration is shown, are bad.* And indeed the rule
</p>
<p>is that where no consideration is shown or appears itself on the
</p>
<p>face of the instrument, the contract, if in fact a contract in
</p>
<p>restraint of trade, is void, although it is under seal.'
</p>
<p>The court will not, indeed, if a consideration be shown, exam-
</p>
<p>ine as to the sufficiency of the consideration, but whether it is a
</p>
<p>legal one.'

<p>-202 MODIFICATIONS OF THE KULE AS TO CONTKACTS.
</p>
<p>A contract in restraint of trade must liave a good consideration
</p>
<p>and the restraint must be reasonable and limited.'
</p>
<p>The reasonableness of the restriction is a question for the
</p>
<p>court.'
</p>
<p>The autliorities are numerous, and conclusively establish the
</p>
<p>law that contracts in restraint of the freedom of trade must be
</p>
<p>reasonable."
</p>
<p>In determining whether the contract is reasonable such a limit
</p>
<p>should be laid down as, under any circumstauces, possible within
</p>
<p>the contemplation of either party, would be suthcient protection
</p>
<p>to the interests of the contracting l)arty, and if the limit stipu-
</p>
<p>lated for does not exceed that, the contract should be held to be
</p>
<p>valid.*
</p>
<p>A covenant in restraint of trade is valid if it was induced by a
</p>
<p>consideration which made it reasonable for the parties to enter
</p>
<p>therein; and the covenant will be enforced if a disregard thereof
</p>
<p>by the covenantor will work injury to the covenantee,*
</p>
<p>Where the restraint of a party from carrying on a trade or
</p>
<p>business is larger and wider than the protection of the party
</p>
<p>with whom the contract is made can, under such circumstances,
</p>
<p>possibly require, such restraint must be considered as unreasona-
</p>
<p>ble in law, and the contract which would enforce it is therefore
</p>
<p>Toid."

</p>
<p> 47. Presumption as to Legality of Contracts in Partial
</p>
<p>Restraint of Trade. Contracts in partial restraint of trade have
</p>
<p>been said to be presumptively void, and that such presumption
</p>
<p>can be rebutted only by showing that it was entered into for good
</p>
<p>reasons, and that the burden of showing the facts rendering the
</p>
<p>contract vahd rests upon the party seeking to enforce it.*
</p>
<p>It was said in Mitchel v. Eeynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181, 191, that
</p>
<p>" whenever such contract stat indiffei enter, and for aught ap-
</p>
<p>pears, may be either good or bad, the law presumes it prima facie
</p>
<p>to be bad)' * But this doctrine has been disapproved in England,
</p>
<p>and it is now said that there is no '' hard and fast rule "that a con-
</p>
<p>tract in restraint of trade, limited as to space, is invalid; but the
</p>
<p>validity depends upon the reasonableness of the contract.' Indeed
</p>
<p>it is now declared that contracts involving the question of inter-
</p>
<p>ference with trade 2ive prima facie valid.'
</p>
<p> 48. Contract in Restraint of Trade Legal in Part and
</p>
<p>Severable. Although there may be one of the stipulations in a
</p>
<p>contract which may be considered as illegal, yet this will not
</p>
<p>defeat a recovery on the other parts of the contract, when the
</p>
<p>stipulations are divisible and the consideration is not in itself
</p>
<p>illegal."

<p>attempt to make a separation of tlie good consideration from that

<p>which is illegal in those cases where the party seeking to enforce
</p>
<p>the contract is not the wrongdoer.'
</p>
<p>"Where an act, though the resnlt of an unlawful contract, is
</p>
<p>itself lawful, it may form the consideration for a lawful agree-
</p>
<p>ment,  as, for instance, the actual transfer of stock, the agreement
</p>
<p>for which was illegal.*
</p>
<p>So an agreement between former partners in an illegal business,
</p>
<p>to defend their former agents against criminal prosecution, is not
</p>
<p>tainted by the illegality of the business.^
</p>
<p>The general rule is that where the illegal is so interwoven
</p>
<p>with the material portion of the contract that it cannot be
</p>
<p>severed from the legal part of the covenant, the contract is alto-
</p>
<p>gether void. If the connection between the evil and good be
</p>
<p>such as to make the consideration an entirety, and incapable of

<p>severance, the whole promise is void; otherwise it may be upheld

</p>
<p>trade, while the other is not, the court will 2;ive effect to the lat-
</p>
<p>ter if it is capable of independent enforcement and will not hold
</p>
<p>the agreement to be altogether void.'
</p>
<p>Illegality of one provision in such a contract will not necessar-
</p>
<p>ily make the entire contract void.''
</p>
<p>AVliere a contract consists of divisible restrictions, some of which
</p>
<p>are unreasonable, and others are sustainable as not going beyond
</p>
<p>the interest to be protected, the part that is unreasonable may be
</p>
<p>rejected and the other enforced. Thus a stipulation not to engage
</p>
<p>in a particular trade for a limited time, " in the city of St. Louis, or
</p>
<p>at any other place," was held only to restrain the party within the
</p>
<p>city of St. Louis,' and the same rule has been applied elsewhere."
</p>
<p>But in Bishcyp v. Palmer, 6 New Eng. Rep. 129, 146 Mass.
</p>
<p>469, where the contract was not to engage in trade for live years,
</p>
<p>without any limit as to space, and not to enter into the cotton waste
</p>
<p>business in the city of Fall River for five years, it was held that
</p>
<p>as the promise not to engage in trade without limit of space was
</p>
<p>void, as it tends to injure the public, it is deemed a vicious one,
</p>
<p>and rests upon the same ground as though forbidden by statute,^
</p>
<p>and the promise being for one entire consideration, a part of
</p>
<p>which is fraudulent, immoral or unlawful, and there being no
</p>
<p>means of apportionment furnished by the parties themselves, no
</p>
<p>action would lie upon the promise. As the bad part of the con-
</p>
<p>tract is not severable from the good, the whole promise fails.''
</p>
<p>It was contended that the defendants, by being unable to enforce
</p>
<p>the stipulation in question, only lose what they were bound to
</p>
<p>know was legally null; that they have all they supposed they
</p>
<p>were getting, namely, a promise which might be kept, though

<p>incapable of legal enforcement, and that if they were content to-
</p>
<p>accept such a promise, and if there is anotlier good and sufficient
</p>
<p>consideration, they may be held upon their promise. But the
</p>
<p>court deny that the argument can properly extend to a case
</p>
<p>where a part of an entire and inseparable consideration is posi-
</p>
<p>tively vicious, however it might be if it were simply invalid, as in
</p>
<p>Parish v. Stone, 14 Pick. 198. The fact that the plaintiff had
</p>
<p>not failed to perforin his promise not to engage in the business
</p>
<p>mentioned, does not enable him to maintain his action.
</p>
<p>An illegal consideration may be actual, substantial and valuable,,
</p>
<p>but it is not in law sufficient. It may be that if defendants were
</p>
<p>to sue the plaintiff on the contract, they could, so far as the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of legality is concerned, maintain the action upon all its parts
</p>
<p>except the single covenant.' It might be that if defendants pay
</p>
<p>to plaintiff the entire sum called for by the contract, they can call
</p>
<p>upon him to perform all of his agreements, except such as are
</p>
<p>unlawful. In such case they would merely waive a part of what
</p>
<p>they were to receive and recover or enforce the rest, but the court
</p>
<p>denied that this fact gave a right of action to the plaintiff, when
</p>
<p>a part of the consideration of the promise was illegal. The defend-
</p>
<p>ants were at liberty to repudiate the contract on this ground, and
</p>
<p>liaving done so, tJie plaintiff cannot maintain an action on his
</p>
<p>contract for the purchase price agreed upon for the sale of his
</p>
<p>!)usiness. What other liability the defendants might be under to
</p>
<p>the plaintiff by reason of what they may have received under the
</p>
<p>contract, of course, is another question.
</p>
<p> 49. Partial Restriction of Trade not Permissible by
</p>
<p>Corporations.  But the ordinary rule that contracts in partial
</p>
<p>restraint of trade are not invalid, does not apply to corporations
</p>
<p>engaged in a public business and in furnishing that which is a
</p>
<p>matter of public concern. If there be any sort of business which
</p>
<p>from its particular character can be restrained to no extent what-
</p>
<p>ever without prejudice to public interest, the courts would be
</p>
<p>compelled to hold void any contract imposing any restraint, how-

</p>
<p>such partial restrtiint must be regarded as prejudicial to public
</p>
<p>interest.'
</p>
<p>There may be cases where a corporation may abandon a public
</p>
<p>work for reasonable cause,' but this presents altogether a different
</p>
<p>question for determination, from that presented when a corpora-
</p>
<p>tion attempts to disable itself by contract from the performance
</p>
<p>of a duty to the public'
</p>
<p>Certainly a court of equity will not aid either party in the en-
</p>
<p>forcement of a contract by which a corporation abandons a public
</p>
<p>duty.*
</p>
<p>At the present day there is not that danger, resulting to the
</p>
<p>public from contracts restraining trade as formerly, or at least it does
</p>
<p>not seem to exist to an appreciable extent  except possibly as sug-
</p>
<p>gested in the case of corporations. In their supervision and in
</p>
<p>their restriction within tlie limits of their chartered powers, the
</p>
<p>government and the public are directly interested. Corporations
</p>
<p>are great engines for the promotion of the public convenience and
</p>
<p>for the development of public wealth, and so long as they are
</p>
<p>conducted for the purposes for which organized they are a public
</p>
<p>benefit; but if allowed to engage, without supervision, in subjects
</p>
<p>of enterprise foreign to their charters, or if permitted unrestrain-
</p>
<p>edly to control and monopolize the avenues to that industry in
</p>
<p>which they are engaged, they become a public menace, against
</p>
<p>which public policy and statutes design protection.
</p>
<p>It seems where the provisions of corporate agreements in re-
</p>
<p>straint of competition tend beyond measures of self protection
</p>
<p>and threaten the public good in a distinctly appreciable manneiy
</p>
<p>courts, in the exercise of their equitable powers, may interfere,

</p>
<p>but should not do so unless the apprehension of danger to the
</p>
<p>13ublic interests rests upon evident grounds.*
</p>
<p>In Chicago Gaslight d; C Co. v. People's Gaslight <& C. Co. 11
</p>
<p>West. E.ep. 69, 121 III. 530, the defendant company claiming as
</p>
<p>the assignee of the exclusive privilege in the territoiy set oti: to
</p>
<p>it, filed a bill against the other for a specific performance of the
</p>
<p>contract of assignment. The court refused the rehef sought,
</p>
<p>holding "that by the grant of the second charter tlie Legislature
</p>
<p>intended to do away with the monopoly," granted under tlie first;
</p>
<p>"that although the contract involved a partial restraint of trade,
</p>
<p>and therefore might not, by the general rule of law, be invalid,
</p>
<p>yet that the general rule does not apply to corporations engaged
</p>
<p>in a public business in which the public have an interest," and
</p>
<p>that the contract was void.
</p>
<p>If, as has been repeatedly ruled, clothing a corporation with the
</p>
<p>power of eminent domain so stamps the business of such corpora-
</p>
<p>tion with a public character, that that business may not be re-
</p>
<p>stricted by private contract," there is no reason why the same
</p>
<p>public character should not attach to a corporation which is vested
</p>
<p>with the right and power to tear up and use the streets of a great
</p>
<p>city. The fee of the streets, or at least the control of the streets,
</p>
<p>is vested in such city for the benefit of the public. Any business
</p>
<p>which requires their use, requires the use of property which be-
</p>
<p>longs either absolutely or unrestricted, so far as the public service
</p>
<p>i-equires control, to the public.^
</p>
<p>Thus where a gas company has the exclusive privilege under its
</p>
<p>charter of supplying the city of Chicago for ten years, a contract
</p>
<p>during that period, foregoing that exclusive right within a part of
</p>
<p>such territory, would be valid as parting only with the j^rivilege
</p>
<p>conferred for the benefit of the company; but, where, after the

<p>monopoly in the furnishing of gas to the city, and therefore against

</p>
<p>To a contract thus perpetuating a monoi)oly, the ordinary rule
</p>
<p>invalidating a contract of restraint, which has no reasonable limit
</p>
<p>as to time, must apply, for there is nothing in the nature of a
</p>
<p>franchise which makes a contract between parties in reference to
</p>
<p>time less obligatoiy than one made in reference to other matters.^
</p>
<p>The exercise and use of franchises of a corporation for the ben-
</p>
<p>efit of the public is a condition on which it is allowed to be cre-
</p>
<p>ated and maintained; and when it voluntarily declines to fulfill
</p>
<p>this condition or places itself in a situation, as a consequence of its
</p>
<p>voluntary action, in which that may be prevented, it may be an-
</p>

</p>
<p>should not be changed below a certain specified rate without the

<p>a public nature, to meet a public necessity; and where such busi-

<p>and it is hardly conceivable that such restraint can otherwise re-
</p>
<p>sult, contracts imposing such restraints, however partial, will not

<p>be enforced or sustained, because in contravention of public pol-

<p>disable itself by contract from performing the public duties which

</p>
<p>as, an agreement to absorb and monopolize the transportation of
</p>
<p>a community.'
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the immediate effect of such monopoly,
</p>
<p>though at its inception it may reduce prices for the purpose of
</p>
<p>crushing existing competition, its final result is to vest in those in
</p>
<p>control of the monopoly the absolute iixing of values. It does
</p>
<p>not do this upon the natural law, of supply and demand, but cre-
</p>
<p>ates an artificial scarcity of the article, to be filled only upon com-
</p>
<p>[)liance with its terms. It lias repeatedly been condemned by the
</p>
<p>courts as unlawful. Agreements to create a monopoly and to sti-
</p>
<p>fle competition in trade are void, and conspiracies to control trade
</p>
<p>are indictable even at common law and should be met with firm
</p>
<p>resistance among a free and in(k'i)endent people, desirous of main-
</p>
<p>taining commercial liberty."
</p>
<p>That combinations to control the necessities or comforts of civ-
</p>
<p>ilized communities should be resisted by legislative power, is
</p>
<p>shown in the enactments of many of the states and in the Act of

<p>attorneys of the United States, in their respective districts, under
</p>
<p>the direction of the Attorney-General, to institute proceedings in
</p>
<p>equity to prevent and restrain such violations. Such proceedings

<p>may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that

<p>such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When

<p>the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such

</p>
<p>j^or can the obligations under which the courts rest to enforce
</p>
<p>such legislation be more clearly shown than in an opinion pro-
</p>
<p>nounced by Jiidge Key in the United States Circuit Court for the
</p>
<p>Middle District of Tennessee, where suit was brought to enjoin
</p>
<p>certain coal mining companies from unlawfully combining to re-
</p>
<p>strain interstate trade and commerce in coal at Nashville contrary
</p>
<p>to the provisions of the United States statute.
</p>
<p>On September 25, 1890, a petition for injunction was filed set-
</p>
<p>ting forth as follows:
</p>
<p>That the defendants, a number of whom are Kentucky mining
</p>
<p>companies, and another number are coal dealers in Nashville,
</p>
<p>Tennessee, secretly entered into an illegal contract and combina-
</p>
<p>tion in the form of a trust, and entered into a conspiracy with one

</p>
<p>which restrained the trade and commerce in coal at Nashville be-

<p>tween the states of Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee.

<p>That the defendants combining and confederating, by articles

</p>
<p>of agreement more particularly set forth in tlie decision (see de-
</p>
<p>cision j, under the name of the ''Nashville Coal Exchange" monop-
</p>
<p>olized the trade in coal which is produced in Kentucky and shipped
</p>
<p>from thence to Nashville, Tennessee, contrary to the provisions
</p>
<p>of this Act. The prayer of the petition is that the defendants be
</p>
<p>enjoined or otherwise prohibited from violating the provisions of
</p>
<p>the said Act of Congress and that they be enjoined and restrained
</p>
<p>from further monopolizing and carrying on the coal trade in Nash-
</p>
<p>ville under the combination and confederation as aforesaid.
</p>
<p>A brief abstract of the ai-guinent and citations of authorities of
</p>
<p>counsel in the case is of value. Mr. John Ruhm, U. S. Atty.,
</p>
<p>for complainant insisted that the power of Congress to enact the
</p>
<p>statute which is the basis of this lawsuit is derived from U. S.
</p>
<p>Const,, art. 1,  8, subsecs. 3, 18, giving Congress power to regu-
</p>
<p>late commerce among the states. This power is unlimited and
</p>
<p>paramount; it is co-extensive with the entire field of commerce.'
</p>
<p>Interstate commerce consists of traffic and transportation be-
</p>
<p>tween the states; and Congress may regulate tiie traffic, or the
</p>
<p>transportation, or both.^
</p>
<p>The power to regulate is unlimited, so long as it is confined to
</p>
<p>interstate commerce.^
</p>
<p>Congress may confer little, or much, or all jurisdiction upon
</p>
<p>the existing inferior federal cijurts, oj" may create other courts and
</p>
<p>clothe them with jurisdiction in all matters, where the subject of
</p>
<p>legislation is within the power delegated by the Constitution.*

</p>
<p>mini to any j)art of interstate trade."
</p>
<p>Mr. James Trimble, Special Asst. to IT. S. Atty., made the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing additional points for complainant:
</p>
<p>As courts of equity, the United States circuit ctmrts, by their
</p>
<p>inherent jurisdiction, regardless of the Act of July 2, 1890, have
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the subject matter to grant the relief prayed.'
</p>
<p>Article 1,  8, of the Constitution confers upon CiMigress the
</p>
<p>power "to regulate commerce" etc., and "to make all laws, which
</p>
<p>shall be necessaiy and proper for carrying" the foregoing powers
</p>
<p>"into execution."
</p>
<p>"The power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in
</p>
<p>itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no
</p>
<p>limitations other than are prescril)ed in the Constitution."'
</p>
<p>As to "interstate commerce," the United States, as a govern-
</p>
<p>nient, possesses unlimited power, and can by congressional action
</p>
<p>exercise all the rights of "a sovereign goyernment." One of the
</p>
<p>well recognized powers of a sovereign government is to institute
</p>
<p>proceedings in its own name on behalf of the public, or to permit
</p>
<p>its name to be used by private individuals specially injured, to
</p>
<p>])revent and restrain })ul)lic nuisances."
</p>
<p>A combination, the tendency of which is to prevent general
</p>
<p>competition and to control prices, is detrimental to the })ublic and
</p>
<p>unlawful.'

<p>intention was to transport the coal to Nashville, although it was pur-
</p>
<p>chased for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Until actually launched on its way to another State, it is not
</p>
<p>under the jurisdiction of the United States.'
</p>
<p>These sales, with reference to which the agreement regulates
</p>
<p>prices, are sales of coal having its situs in Nashville. The whole
</p>
<p>transaction is wholly within the State. This is not interstate
</p>
<p>commerce. The fact that the coal is l)rouc!:lit from another State
</p>
<p>does not prevent the jurisdiction of Tennessee from attaching,^
</p>
<p>The only limitation upon the State, with reference to property
</p>
<p>broutj^ht from another State, and over contracts relatino^ thereto,
</p>
<p>is, that it cannot take away or impair the right of the importer to-
</p>
<p>sell it in the "original package," "unbroken" and "unopened," *
</p>
<p>With these limitations the State has jurisdiction over the prop-
</p>
<p>erty even in the "original package." *
</p>
<p>The right of the United States to maintain a suit in equity is
</p>
<p>governed by the same principles which apply to other parties. It
</p>
<p>must have an interest in the subject-matter,*
</p>
<p>The bill in this case is nothing else than an "information in
</p>
<p>equity," cliarging defendants with a misdemeanor. The Consti-
</p>
<p>tution provides that the " trial of all crimes, except in cases of
</p>
<p>impeachment, shall be by jury," whether that trial is followed by
</p>
<p>an injunction or a sentence."
</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of equity in England to issue injunctions in
</p>

<p>The provision of the Act of July 2, 1890, authorizing this pro-

</p>
<p>An agreement between a number of persons to act concernedly

<p>it appears that they have a monopoly of that product.^
</p>
<p>The defendants in this case control but an insignilicant part of
</p>
<p>a vast supply of coal. Each coal company has its sole or exclusive
</p>
<p>agents, or dealers, and will not sell to or through others. This is
</p>
<p>not illegal or against public policy.^
</p>
<p>After full consideration of the questions presented, Key, ./.,
</p>
<p>delivered the following opinion :
</p>
<p>The petition in this case is filed against the members of the-
</p>
<p>Nashville Coal Exchange. The membership of the exchange is
</p>
<p>composed of various coal mining companies operating mines in
</p>
<p>Kentucky and Tennessee, chiefly in Kentucky, and of persons and
</p>
<p>lirms dealing in coal at Nashville, Tenn. It is alleged that the
</p>
<p>purposes, objects and agreement of the defendants are in violation
</p>
<p>of an Act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, entitled, "An Act
</p>
<p>to Protect Trade and Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and
</p>
<p>Monopolies," and the petition seeks to restrain and prevent the
</p>
<p>violations of the Act by injunction under section 4 of the law.

<p>restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, is

<p>declared illegal." The second section declares that, " every per-
</p>
<p>.son who shall monopolize or combine or conspire with another
</p>
<p>}>erson or persons to monopolize any part of the trade or com-
</p>
<p>merce among the several states . . . shall be guilty of a
</p>
<p>misdemeanor," A violation of the first section is a misdemeanor
</p>
<p>also. By the fourth section jurisdiction is conferred upon the
</p>
<p>circuit courts of the United States to prevent and restrain viola-
</p>
<p>tions of the Act, and it is made the duty of district attorneys in
</p>
<p>their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General of the United States, to institute proceedings in equity
</p>
<p>to prevent and restrain such violations. The articles of agree-
</p>
<p>ment between the defendants provide, amongst other things, that
</p>
<p>the objects of this exchange are, " to do all in its power to
</p>
<p>advance the interests of the coal business at Nashville, to treat all
</p>
<p>parties to this agreement in a fair and equitable manner, and to
</p>
<p>establish prices on coal at Nashville, Tenn., and to change same
</p>
<p>from time to time, as occasion may require." Prices to con-
</p>
<p>sumers at Nashville are to be established so as to sell coal at
</p>
<p>a fair and reasonable price, so as to allow all parties a fair
</p>
<p>profit for their product. Every person, firm or corporation
</p>
<p>owning or operating mines who ship coal to Nashville shall
</p>
<p>be eligible to membership in this exchange, and all coal deal-
</p>
<p>ers in the city of Nashville are also eligible to membership.
</p>
<p>None others are eligible. Any member of the exchange who
</p>
<p>may withdraw from it and continue in the coal trade in Nashville,
</p>
<p>or ship any coal to Nashville, shall forfeit and relinquish all inter-
</p>
<p>est of any and every kind, however obtained or accrued. The
</p>
<p>exchange will from time to time establish prices at which coal

<p>tihall be sold in Nashville. Coal classed as No. 1 shall be valued

<p>at the mines at 4:^ cents minimum price of eighty pounds lump,

<p>ly or indirectly, shall be lined 2 cents per bushel and $10 for the
</p>
<p>first offense, and 4 cents per bushel and $20 for the second
</p>
<p>offense. A majority of all the members shall constitute a quorum
</p>
<p>for the transaction of business.
</p>
<p>Owners or operators of mines shall not sell or ship coal to any
</p>
<p>person, firm or corporation in Xashville, or West Xashville, or
</p>
<p>East Xashville, who are not members of the exchange, and deal-
</p>
<p>ers shall not buy coal from anyone not a member of the exchange.
</p>
<p>All coal used for manufacturing and steamboat purposes shall be
</p>
<p>exempt from prices made by the exchange until all mines tribu-
</p>
<p>tary to this market shall become members of the exchange, or
</p>
<p>until the exchange can control prices to govern coal used by
</p>
<p>manufacturers, l^o coal shall be sold in any month to be deliv-
</p>
<p>ered in any following month except at prices fixed for the par-
</p>
<p>ticular month in which coal so sold is to be delivered. Fines and
</p>
<p>penalties are declared so as to enforce the stipulations embodied
</p>
<p>in the constitution and by-laws of the exchange.
</p>
<p>It can hardly be denied that such provisions as these, by a body
</p>
<p>of persons such as compose this exchange, constitute a contract or
</p>
<p>combination in restraint of trade or commerce, or an attempt
</p>
<p>between different persons to monopolize a part of the trade or
</p>
<p>commerce between parties who are citizens of or reside in differ-
</p>
<p>ent states. It is shown that several mining companies in Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky engaged in raising coal, and most of the coal dealers of
</p>
<p>Kashville, Tenn., have entered into the foregoing mentioned
</p>
<p>arrangement. It is insisted for the defendants that the subject
</p>
<p>of agreement is not interstate commerce ; that the obligation as
</p>
<p>to the mining companies ends at the mines. The price is fixed
</p>
<p>and paid at that point, and consequently controversies in regard
</p>
<p>to the contract as to them belong exclusively to the courts of the
</p>
<p>State of Kentucky; that so far as the dealers are concerned the
</p>
<p>price of the coal is fixed for its sale at Xashville, and after it
</p>
<p>becomes their property by delivery to them, and therefore the

</p>
<p>courts of Tennessee have the jurisdiction as to them. Yarious
</p>
<p>authorities are cited, and the debates in the Senate of the United
</p>
<p>States are read to sustain this view of the case. As I understand
</p>
<p>the contention of defendant's counsel it is that the agreement is
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>226 MONOPOLY.
</p>
<p>not violative of the terms of the Act of July 2, 1890. But if it
</p>
<p>is the Act is unconstitutional : first, because the Constitution con-
</p>
<p>fers upon the courts of the United States in such a case jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion over " controversies between citizens of different states."
</p>
<p>That the fact that parties to a contract are citizens of different
</p>
<p>states does not confer jurisdiction. There must be a controversy
</p>
<p>between the parties to the contract, and this litigation is not a
</p>
<p>dispute between the contracting parties, but between the govern-
</p>
<p>ment and these parties. Second, that the Act creates and defines
</p>
<p>criminal offenses, and the Constitution provides that the " trial of
</p>
<p>all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury, and
</p>
<p>that section 4 of the Act, so far as it attempts to give circuit
</p>
<p>courts of the United States equitable jurisdiction over the viola-
</p>
<p>tions of the Act. is unconstitutional. It is insisted the proceed-
</p>
<p>ing authorized is in substance an information in equity charging
</p>
<p>defendants with a misdemeanor.
</p>
<p>I shall not enter into a discussion of the constitutionality of the
</p>
<p>law. A court, especially an inferior one, should hesitate long and
</p>
<p>consider carefully before it should declare an Act of Congress,
</p>
<p>passed after deliberation and del;)ate and ap]iroved by the presi-
</p>
<p>dent, unconstitutional. The reasons for such a decision in such a
</p>
<p>case should be clear and undeniable. If doubtful or questionable
</p>
<p>the doubt should be resolved in favor of the law.
</p>
<p>The arguments against the validity of the Act have been urged
</p>
<p>with great plausibility and strength, and an army of authorities
</p>
<p>have been read as sustaining the views of defendant's counsel. The
</p>
<p>positions of defendant's counsel have been met with equal force
</p>
<p>and ability by those representing the government, and many
</p>
<p>authorities have been referred to in support of the power of Con-
</p>
<p>gress to pass the law; and without nicely adjusting and weighing
</p>
<p>the opposing views of counsel, enough appears to prevent me
</p>
<p>from declaring the Act, or any part of it, as outside of the powers
</p>
<p>granted to Congress by the Constitution.
</p>
<p>The remaining question is whether the agreement and regula-

</p>
<p>restraint of trade or commerce between states;'' are they evidence
</p>
<p>of a combination to monopolize " any part of the trade or com-
</p>
<p>merce" between the states of Tennessee and Kentucky. The
</p>
<p>COMBINATIDXS TO CONTROL THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE. 227
</p>
<p>coal mines are in Kentucky, and the coal is to be mined there for
</p>
<p>a certain price, and the agreement contemplates its shipment to
</p>
<p>Xashville. To be sure it is not to be transported thither by the
</p>
<p>defendants or any of them, but the price for which it is to be
</p>
<p>shipped is lixed or stated, and becomes a part of the price for
</p>
<p>which the coal is to be sold at Nashville; and when the prices
</p>
<p>fixed " are advanced in excess of the advance in freights, the one
</p>
<p>half of the advance shall go to the mine ownei's and one half to
</p>
<p>the dealers." In making the agreement the transportation of the
</p>
<p>coal from Kentnck}^ to Nashville was a necessary incident to and
</p>
<p>clement in the arrangement, and its execntion would have been
</p>
<p>impossible without it. The instrumentality of transportation did
</p>
<p>not belong to, nor was it controlled by them, but it was used by
</p>
<p>them and paid by them for services rendered. The contract pro-
</p>
<p>vided for the sale of coal in Kentucky, its shipment to Nashville,
</p>
<p>Tenn., to dealers there, for its retail to consumers. It was to all
</p>
<p>intents and purposes a traffic trade, commerce between states.
</p>
<p>Was the purpose of the exchange to monopolize a part of this
</p>
<p>trade, or to combine in restraint thereof ? The exchange does not
</p>
<p>propose to be governed and controlled l)y the pulilic markets aris-
</p>
<p>ing from competition and the operations of the laws of supply
</p>
<p>and demand. On the contrary, it announces that its purpose is
</p>
<p>"to estal)lish prices on coal at Nashville, Tenn., and to change the
</p>
<p>same from time to time as occasion may require," and in carrying
</p>
<p>out this object it asserts that " the exchange will establish prices
</p>
<p>at which coal shall be sold in Nashville, subject, however,
</p>
<p>to the following conditions and bases: Coal classed as No. 1 to be
</p>
<p>valued at the mines at 4 cents, minimum price, per bushel of
</p>
<p>eighty-iive pounds for lump, and freight being 4 cents, the dealer's
</p>
<p>margin to be 4^ cents, making the price of lump coal 13 cents per
</p>
<p>bushel; No. 2 to be valued at 5 cents at the mines; No. 3, 6 cents;
</p>
<p>and when the above prices are advanced in excess of the advance

</p>
<p>directly or indirectly, shall be fined 2 cents per bushel and 10 for

<p>the lirst offense, and 4 cents a bushel and 20 for the second

</p>
<p>228 MONOPOLY.
</p>
<p>SO, fixed the lowest price of coal to consumers in and near Nash-
</p>
<p>ville at 13 cents per bushel and prevented coal being sold there at
</p>
<p>a cheaper rate, no matter how ranch less it might cost in an open
</p>
<p>and unobstructed market. JS^or is this all. The exchange ordains
</p>
<p>that "-owners or operators of mines shall not sell or ship coal to
</p>
<p>any firm, person or corporation in Xashville or West Kashville or
</p>
<p>East Nashville who are not members of this exchange, and dealers
</p>
<p>shall not buy coal from anyone who is not a member of the
</p>
<p>exchange." The coal trade is confined to dealings, so far as the
</p>
<p>market supply is concerned, to transactions between the miner
</p>
<p>and dealer; the prices are fixed by them and the miner and dealer
</p>
<p>only are eligible to membership. The miners of the concern can-
</p>
<p>not sell to any dealer in or near Nashville who is npt a party to
</p>
<p>the agreement, nor can such dealer purchase coal of any miner
</p>
<p>anywhere who is not a member of the body. The operations of
</p>
<p>both are confined within the membership. So far as Nashville is
</p>
<p>concerned, they cannot go to cheaper or more favorable markets,
</p>
<p>or deal with those who would give more favorable terms. The
</p>
<p>restraint is positive and undeniable. Moreover, in the first section
</p>
<p>of the by-laws of the exchange it is asserted that ' all coal used
</p>
<p>for manufacturing and steaml)oat purposes shall be exempt from
</p>
<p>prices made by this exchange until all mines tributary to this mar-
</p>
<p>ket shall become members of the exchange, or until the exchange
</p>
<p>can control prices to govern coal used by manufacturers." This
</p>
<p>clearly indicates the purpose of the association to be to control the
</p>
<p>price of coal in the Nashville market used in manufacturing and
</p>
<p>in steaml)oats, whenever it could; that the mines of coal, tributary
</p>
<p>to Nashville were all expected to becomes members of the ex-
</p>
<p>change, whereupon the prices of coal could be fixed absolutely,
</p>
<p>and the necessary inference from this declaration and the entire
</p>
<p>organic structure of the body is that it felt strong enough already
</p>
<p>to regulate and establish the prices of domestic coal in that mar-
</p>
<p>ket, to a large extent at least, and that this exchange might now
</p>
<p>monopolize the business of dealing in domestic coal in the Nash-

</p>
<p>membership the entire trade in coal at that point. It seems to

<p>have been more successfully framed to fall within the provisions

<p>EFFECT OF COXSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING MONOPOLIES. 229
</p>
<p>of the Act of July 2, 1S90, had the object been to orajauize a
</p>
<p>combination, the business of wliicli should subject it to the penal-
</p>
<p>ties of that statute, and that there is no need of authorities to
</p>
<p>sustain such view of the case. Regarding the Act as constitu-
</p>
<p>tional, I see no way for the defendants to escape its condemnation.
</p>
<p>Proof has been taken, on the one hand, to establish that the
</p>
<p>people of Xashville have been and are being injured by the high
</p>
<p>prices which have been and are being paid for coal, and the extent
</p>
<p>of the injury. On the other liand, defendants have introduced
</p>
<p>proof to show that the higher freight rates to Xasliville and the
</p>
<p>want of facilities for transportation by railroad and water are the
</p>
<p>causes for the higher prices of coal at Xashville than at Louisville
</p>
<p>or Meinphis, but it is needless to enter upon this branch of dis-
</p>
<p>pute. " The attempt to monopolize or combine " is denounced by
</p>
<p>the second section of the Act, and the first section, " every con-
</p>
<p>tract or combination in restraint of trade or commerce among the
</p>
<p>several states." The attempt, the contract to do the thing pro-
</p>
<p>hibited, is enough to incur the penalties of tliis law.
</p>
<p>I conclude that the defendants, by the organization of the Xash-
</p>
<p>ville Coal Exchange, and their operations under it, have been, and
</p>
<p>at the time of filing the petition in this cause were, guilty of a vio-
</p>
<p>lation of sections 1 and 2 of the Act of July 2, 1S90, and should be
</p>
<p>enjoined from further violations of the law, as provided by the
</p>
<p>fourth section thereof.*

</p>
<p>The public policy of a State may be indicated by the provisions
</p>
<p>of its Constitution as related to past and present lecjislation.
</p>
<p>In Hew Orleans Gas Light Co. v. Louisiana L. c5 //. P. ct*
</p>
<p>Mfg. Co. 115 U. S. 650, 29 L. ed. 516, a gas company had been
</p>
<p>given, in 1835, the exclusive privilege of making and selling gas
</p>
<p>in ^e\y Orleans for some fifty years, and the question was
</p>
<p>whether such exclusive privilege was abrogated by the new Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of 1879, M'hich contained a provision abolishing the
</p>
<p>monopoly features in all existing charters. The United States
</p>
<p>Supreme Court said in that case: " The monopoly clanse only
</p>
<p>evinces a purpose to reverse the policy, previously pursued, of
</p>
<p>granting to private corporations franchises, accom])anied by ex-
</p>
<p>clusive privileges, as a means of accomplishing puljHc objects."
</p>
<p>In states, therefore, where the Constitution has by amendment
</p>
<p>prohibited the granting of special charters to CDrporations, the
</p>
<p>policy as op]>osed to monopolies of every descriptif>n is clearly
</p>
<p>thereby indicated, and courts must give effect to this policy by
</p>
<p>refushig to recognize the legal existence of corporations formed
</p>
<p>under general laws for the purpose of purchasing the controlling
</p>
<p>stock in corporations which are engaged in competing for pu])lic
</p>
<p>favor and patronage. If one great corporation, whether formed
</p>
<p>for the purpose, or deviating from its legal objects, may purchase
</p>
<p>the controlling interest in other corporations and manage them as
</p>
<p>one, all the purposes of the constitutional provisions against
</p>
<p>monopoly are sul)verted, and the courts in aiding the evasion of the
</p>
<p>constitutional prohibition become parties to the crime.'
</p>
<p>Where the state Constitution provides substantially, as it does
</p>
<p>in many of the states, that the General Assembly shall not grant
</p>
<p>to any citizen or class of citizens privileges or immunities which
</p>
<p>upon the same terms shall not equally belong to all citizens, it
</p>
<p>follows as a general rule that, acting under such a constitution,
</p>
<p>neither the State nor a municipal government can grant or create
</p>
<p>a monopoly, as the express spirit and policy of the law forbid
</p>
<p>either from creating monopolies by favoring one corporation to

<p>in this prohibition and made thereby unlawful. Many things
</p>
<p>which are lawful are, from their nature and of necessity, monop-
</p>
<p>olies, such are patent rights, copyrights, the right to keep a ferry
</p>
<p>and many other things which might be mentioned.
</p>
<p>Thus it is probably true that a municipal corporation may make
</p>
<p>a contract wdth a gas company for supplying light to the public
</p>
<p>lamps under such a constitutional proyision, eyen though it be for
</p>
<p>a number of years.'
</p>
<p>As a street railroad company has no legal right to lay its track
</p>
<p>upon the streets of a city without the permission of the common
</p>
<p>council, if the city should grant such right to one company and
</p>
<p>refuse to grant it to another, the company to which the right was
</p>
<p>granted would have a monopoly, until such time as the common
</p>
<p>council should grant a similar right to some other person or com-
</p>
<p>pany. So if the common council should grant to a street railroad
</p>
<p>company the right to lay its track on certain streets which were
</p>
<p>too narrow to admit of being occupied by other street raih-oad
</p>
<p>tracks, such company would have a monopoly of such streets. It
</p>
<p>is plain, therefore, that while monopolies, as a general rule, both
</p>
<p>at common law, on principle, and by statute, as violative of consti-
</p>
<p>tutional provisions and limitatii^ns, are unlawful, there are many
</p>
<p>exceptions to the rule. The rule applies only to such things as are
</p>
<p>of common right, and is never to be applied to such things as are
</p>
<p>in their nature a monopoly.
</p>
<p>Judge Elliott, in his valuahle work on Roads and Streets, in dis-
</p>
<p>cussing this question at page 566, says: "To deny the power of
</p>
<p>the Legislature to make a grant that is of necessity of a monopo-
</p>
<p>listic character would lead to the unwarranted conclusion that in
</p>
<p>no case can tlie Legislature grant the right to lay or operate a
</p>
<p>street railway in a road, or street; for, if the power to make such
</p>
<p>grant be conceded, it necessarily and unavoidably results that the
</p>
<p>occupancy of the part of the road or street is exclusive, as two
</p>
<p>railways cannot occupy the same space."

<p>period.'
</p>
<p>But tliere are also antliorities wliich under such a constitutional
</p>
<p>provision deny this power.'
</p>
<p>In many of the states articles forbidding monopolies have been
</p>
<p>incorporated in the amended constitutions, and in others, statute&
</p>
<p>have been enacted for the same purpose.
</p>
<p>Monopolies are in denial of common right, and are unconstitu-
</p>
<p>tional and void.^ The idea has been expressed that granting such
</p>
<p>a privilege is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States." And it is said that under the
</p>
<p>Fourteenth Amendment every citizen of the United States should
</p>
<p>be able to plead his citizenship of the Republic as a protection
</p>
<p>against any similar invasion of his privileges and immunities. "^
</p>
<p>It was early held that they are contrary to public policy.*
</p>
<p>Where there is restraint on the one hand, there is monopoly on the
</p>
<p>other, and monopolies are odious to the law.' The dangerous-
</p>
<p>nature of monopoly has become not only more apparent as com-

</p>
<p>are matters of public concern, and the essential question is one of
</p>
<p>monopoly producing injury to tlie public/ A contract which
</p>
<p>creates a monopoly is void as in violation of a Constitution,
</p>
<p>which declares that "perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to
</p>
<p>the genius of a free government, and shall never be allowed." If
</p>
<p>such is the effect of any contract, it is unlawful as forbidden by
</p>
<p>the Constitution, and no legislation can give validity to it.* There
</p>
<p>are three inseparable results to every monopoly: (1) that the price
</p>
<p>of the same commodity will be raised; (2) that after the grant the
</p>
<p>commodity is not so good and marketable as before; (3) that it
</p>
<p>tends to impoverishment of divers artisans, artificers and others.'
</p>
<p>An exclusive privilege granted to a few individuals, not for the
</p>
<p>public good, but for their own interests and their successors incor-
</p>
<p>porated into a society, and prohibiting all others from exercising
</p>
<p>the same privilege, violates the fundamental rights of citizens

<p>willing to conform to the constitutional regulations and restrictions

<p>of business.*

</p>
<p>thrift and welfare of the people disappear. Legitimate business
</p>
<p>aims to acquire competence or perhaps moderate wealth, by
</p>
<p>honest lalior, toil and frugality. Monopoly seeks to suppress
</p>
<p>the comj^etition which naturally only produces such results, and
</p>
<p>substitutes combination among producers to reduce production,
</p>
<p>and enhance prices without the corresponding toil of production.
</p>
<p>All combinations which propose or may in fact tend to impede
</p>
<p>free and fair competition in trade are therefore illegal and void as

<p>being against public policy.'

</p>
<p>All contracts having a tendency to stifle competition or to

</p>
<p>If the object of a contract is to prevent or impede free and fair

</p>
<p>A contract entered into by the grain dealers of a town which,

<p>COMBINATIONS TO MONOPOLIZE.
</p>
<p> 55. Cowhiuafiom in Variovs Disguises to Monopolize the Markets
</p>
<p>56. Union of Corporations in a Partnersliip to Suppress Competi-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>57. Combination between Corporations tvithont Partnership.
</p>
<p> 55. Combinations in Yavions Disgnises to Monopolize the
</p>
<p>Marliet. These combinations assume various disguises. In some
</p>
<p>instances an association is formed for the manufacture of an
</p>
<p>article of ordinary domestic use. An enormous amount of capital
</p>
<p>is aggregated to purchase and absorb all manufactories of the
</p>
<p>article in the country and to prevent any other person or corpora-
</p>
<p>tion from engaging in or carrying on the same, thereby pre-
</p>
<p>venting all competition in the sale of the article monopolized.
</p>
<p>Those manufacturers who will not enter into the scheme are
</p>
<p>bought out or crushed by temporarily supplying the market they
</p>
<p>cater to at prices below the cost of production. All who unite hi
</p>
<p>the combination and all who are bought out are required to enter
</p>
<p>into bonds to the eifect that they will not even indirectly engage
</p>
<p>in the production or sale of the article, nor aid nor encourage any
</p>
<p>one else to do so. All trade secrets are to be kept from the pub-
</p>
<p>lic and apprentices excluded from learning the art. Others pro-
</p>
<p>posing to ensjage in the production are frightened or bought otf
</p>
<p>and the result is that one vast combination controls the production
</p>
<p>and sale of an article which may be used in every family, and per-
</p>
<p>haps necessary to the comfort and convenience of the people. Its
</p>
<p>price is thereafter to be iixed by the seliish greed of tlie combina-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>This price must not only pay an extravagant profit on produc-
</p>
<p>tion but it must also reimburse the combination for all the money
</p>
<p>spent in the purchase of plants, and machinery, M-hich the neces-
</p>
<p>sity of paralyzing competition has induced, and which will there-
</p>
<p>after be idle, if not destroyed. It must also i-epay the money

<p>expended to induce active labor to live thereafter in idleness, or in
</p>
<p>less remunerative occupation, and thus the pul)lic must pay not
</p>
<p>ciily an unreasonable profit upon the manufacture of the monopo-
</p>
<p>lized article, but must pay for the costly destruction of the imple-
</p>
<p>ments of honest industry and the support of enforced idleness, and
</p>
<p>of an increased non-producing class. It must pay for the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of all the means it possessed to relieve itself from the imposi-
</p>
<p>tions of the monopoly. When such a case was j^resented in the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of Michigan in liichardson v. Buhl, 6 L. II. A.
</p>
<p>457, 77 Mich. 632, and counsel on each side refused to raise the
</p>
<p>question of illegality, the court on its own motion took notice of
</p>
<p>the crime against the community and denied relief, declaring that
</p>
<p>courts will take notice on their own motion of illegal contracts
</p>
<p>which come before them for adjudication, and M'ill leave the par-
</p>
<p>ties where they have placed themselves ; that the organization of a
</p>
<p>corporation for the purpose of controlling the manufacture and
</p>
<p>trade in matches in the United States and Canada, by inducing all
</p>
<p>manufacturers of matches to enter into a combination securing to
</p>
<p>^such corporation the whole control of the business, or by buying
</p>
<p>out those who would not so enter, and buying off any others who
</p>
<p>might propose to engage in the business, is an unlawful enterprise,
</p>
<p>being an attempt to create a monopoly ; and that an agreement
</p>
<p>intended to aid in the formation and organization of an illegal cor-
</p>
<p>poration designed to secure a monopoly of a certain business by
</p>
<p>which, in consideration of indorsements and other financial aid to
</p>
<p>a shareholder to enable him to raise funds necessary to join the
</p>
<p>enterprise, the indorsers are to have a share of the net earnings of
</p>
<p>his stock, is void on grounds of public policy.
</p>
<p>It is true that the tendency of the union of private capital in
</p>
<p>corporate freedom, has been to promote competition in great
</p>
<p>undertakings, where combined wealth and energy are demanded.
</p>
<p>Vast enterprises, with attending risks and perils, are ventured on
</p>
<p>when the extreme limit of loss is only the corporate capital
</p>
<p>invested, with no hazard to private fortunes, and neither the fear

<p>of physical death, nor commercial or moral ruin deter the artificial
</p>
<p>being, if the prize at stake be sufficient. The results of such cor-
</p>
<p>porate activity and courage are the vast development of manufac-
</p>
<p>turing, farming and mining interests and of carrier transportation.
</p>
<p>238 ( OMBINATIONS TO MoNuroLIZE.
</p>
<p>Working in harmony, the carrier transfers the product of the-
</p>
<p>farm, the loom and the furnace to the most profitable market, and
</p>
<p>milhons thus enjoy what, if individual enterprise were alone act-
</p>
<p>ing, the few only could sliare.'
</p>
<p>Universal distribution of production enlarges the market and
</p>
<p>promotes consumption. It reduces cost and it opens fields of new
</p>
<p>activity. It is to the freedom of corporate existence that much of
</p>
<p>the present connnercial prosperity is owing. Like individual com-
</p>
<p>bination for lawful pursuit, corporate coml)ination for like pur-
</p>
<p>poses is to be approved, and it is followed by e(]ually beneficent
</p>
<p>results. Connecting lines of transportation by union in running
</p>
<p>arrangements, clieapens the tariff of charges. So long as competi-
</p>
<p>tion is open, combination of individuals in partnership or corporate
</p>
<p>effort is harmless to the public. But even competition may
</p>
<p>become in itself an evil,* and pooling the earnings of competing
</p>
<p>roads, where the sole purpose is to prevent ruinous competition,
</p>
<p>and not attempting to increase the rate for transportation beyond
</p>
<p>a reasonable amount for the service rendered, is not in any true-
</p>
<p>sense inimical to public policy. The charges for freight do not
</p>
<p>generally in fact seem to be regulated by the cost of the road or
</p>
<p>its equipment, but rather by the rate that can be paid profitably
</p>
<p>by the article transported to market. Where tlie purpose is hon-
</p>
<p>est and to save from destruction valuable prtjperty, through reck-
</p>
<p>less competition, there can be no legitimate complaint against
</p>
<p>pooling the earnings of competing roads or of rival manufacturers.'*

<p>While it is justly urged that those rules which say that a given

</p>
<p>so as to interfere with the freedom of contract/ yet, in the instance

<p>of business of such character that it presumably cannot be restrainetl
</p>
<p>to any extent whatever without prejudice to the public interest,

<p>courts decline to enforce or sustain contracts imposing such

<p>An agreement or combination between sugar refining com-

<p>pation, and thus being prevented from supporting himself and his
</p>
<p>family. It is evident that both these evils occur when the con-
</p>
<p>tract is general, not to pursue one's trade at all, or not to pursue it
</p>
<p>in the entire realm or country. The country suffers the loss in
</p>
<p>both cases; and the party is deprived of his occupation, or is
</p>
<p>obliged to expatriate in order to follow it. A contract that is open
</p>
<p>to such grave objection is clearly against public policy. But if
</p>
<p>neither of these evils ensue, and if the contract is founded on a
</p>
<p>valid consideration and a reasonable ground of benefit to the other
</p>
<p>jjarty, it is free from objection, and may be enforced."
</p>
<p>Innumerable cases, however, might be cited to sustain the prop-
</p>
<p>osition that conil)inations among those engaged in business im-
</p>
<p>pressed with a public or quasi public character, which are mani-
</p>
<p>festly prejudicial to the public interest, cannot be upheld. And
</p>
<p>])resumptively an agreement between two competing systems of
</p>
<p>railroads to divide their earnings for traffic between given points,
</p>
<p>for which they were previously competitors, is against jjublic policy
</p>
<p>and cannot be enforced.'
</p>
<p>The law " cannot recognize as valid any undertaking to do what
</p>
<p>fundamental doctrine or legal rule directly forbids. Nor can it
</p>
<p>give effect to any agreement the making whereof was an act vio-
</p>
<p>lating law. So that, in short, all stipulations to overturn, or in

<p>950, 952, " a corporation, hke a raih'oad company, has granted to

<p>for the public good, the due performance of those functions being
</p>
<p>the consideration of the public grant, any contract which disables

<p>the corporation from performing those functions, which undertakes
</p>
<p>without the consent of the State to transfer to others the rights and
</p>
<p>powers conferred by the charter, and to relieve the grantees of the
</p>
<p>burden which it imposes, is a violation of the contract with the

<p>But as neither human sympathy, moral principle, personal repu-

<p>tation, nor the fear of punishment have deterred individuals from
</p>
<p>forming combinations and conspiracies to control and stitie compe-

<p>exacting unlawful tribute has often proved irresistible, where there

<p>was neither a soul to save, a body to imprison for corporate crime,

<p>nor personal self-respect to sacrifice. And it has been held that the

<p>organization of a corporation for the purpose of controlling the

<p>States and Canada, by getting all manufacturers of such article to

<p>Competition.  Another form with which such combinations are
</p>
<p>clothed is that of a union of corporations in a partnership for a
</p>
<p>division among them of the profits upon the production and sale
</p>
<p>of some article, placed under the control of the partnership, or a
</p>
<p>division of the charges upon transportation by carriers. But the law

<p>UNION OF CORPOKATIONS IN PARTNERSHIP. 243
</p>
<p>A resolution to deliver the stock of a corporation to trustees of
</p>
<p>a certain association or combination, whicli is carried unanimously
</p>
<p>by the votes of all who are present, including every member of the
</p>
<p>trustees of the corporation and all the shareholders except two, who
</p>
<p>own but a small j^art of the stock and who are stated in fact to
</p>
<p>liave consented to the delivery of the stock, is sufficient to make
</p>
<p>the corporation a party to the combination. And where a manu-
</p>
<p>facturing corporation which, instead of manufacturing its product
</p>
<p>and disposing of it to the public on what might V)e fair competi-
</p>
<p>tive prices, becomes a party to a combination in part at least de-
</p>
<p>signed to create a monopoly and exact from the public prices which
</p>
<p>could not be otherwise obtained, is liable to have its cliarter vacated
</p>
<p>and annulled for such subversion of the object for wliicli it was
</p>
<p>created.'
</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals rested its affirmation of the decision in
</p>
<p>People v. North River Sugar Bef. Co. on the sole ground that it
</p>
<p>was unlawful for the corporation to enter into a partnership agree-
</p>
<p>ment which in fact consolidated the corporations,^ the court sim-
</p>
<p>ply declining to decide any other question in the case.'
</p>
<p>The fact that the control of a corporation is by its charter vested
</p>
<p>in a board of directors, seems to preclude such, corporation from
</p>
<p>placing itself by contract in relations with other corporations or
</p>
<p>individuals, which may involve liabilities not assumed by its con-
</p>
<p>stituted authorities.*
</p>
<p>But there are cases where corporations enter into contracts, which
</p>
<p>would amount to partnerships if between individuals, and which,
</p>
<p>whether with other corporations, or with individuals, are in fact in
</p>
<p>the line of the corporate purpose. Under such circumstances,

</p>
<p>courts waiving the question of power to enter into a partnership
</p>
<p>contract, sustain the engagement as being within the object con-
</p>
<p>templated in the creation of the corporation.'
</p>
<p>Of course where the purpose of tlie creation of the corporation
</p>
<p>does not appear, an enterprise in which it may engage, even as a
</p>
<p>partner, cannot readily be sin >\vn to be inconsistent with the object
</p>
<p>of its creation.*
</p>
<p>But the courts are specially solicitous to discountenance all con-
</p>
<p>tracts or arrangements by those pul)lic servants which savor of a
</p>
<p>purpose to stifle com})etition or repress rivalry in the departments
</p>
<p>of business in which they ply their vocation.*
</p>
<p>It has been denied that courts can reach "trusts," where they ex-
</p>
<p>ist under partnerships; it being claimed that partnerships cannot be
</p>
<p>restrained on the ground that their purpose is hostile to freedom of
</p>
<p>trade.* But this is too broad an assertion, A partnership of that
</p>
<p>character is subject to the restraining power of the court. It is im-
</p>
<p>})0ssible under any form of contract to escape the control of a court

<p>without involving partnership liabilities, or constituting a contract
</p>
<p>of partnership. Under proper circumstances and lawful purposes,

<p>there may be a pooling of receipts without a partnership contract.*

<p>COMBINATION BETWEEN CORPORATIONS WITHOUT PARTNERSHIP. 245
</p>
<p>But where such combinatious are made for the purpose of de-
</p>
<p>stroying competition, and imposing unnatural and unreasonable
</p>
<p>rates and charges upon the public, the fact that the corporations
</p>
<p>forming the combination do not enter into any partnership arrange-
</p>
<p>ment, will not relieve the contract in any way from its objection-
</p>
<p>able features as a monopoly.
</p>
<p>Rival steamboat owners sometimes form an engagement to di-
</p>
<p>vide the profits of the carrying trade in a certain proportion witli-
</p>
<p>out creating any partnership. The property rights and responsi-
</p>
<p>bilities of the owner or owners of each boat remain as before the
</p>
<p>arrangement is entered into. Xeither assumes any duty or obliga-
</p>
<p>tion to the other that he is not under before the contract is made,
</p>
<p>except that of pooUng the net profits earned by each, and dividing
</p>
<p>them in certain proportions; but neitlier party is under any obliga-
</p>
<p>tions to the other party to run his boat for a single day. Neither
</p>
<p>party is bound to keep his boat well manned or in good and safe
</p>
<p>condition. The only tie common to both is that of dividing the
</p>
<p>net profits. There is in such relations a strong stimulation to in-
</p>
<p>crease these net profits by means other than that of legitimate poi>
</p>
<p>ularity with the public, resulting from efficient carrying service and
</p>
<p>public accommodation. If one boat can, no matter at what detri-
</p>
<p>ment and inconvenience to the public, perform the service, there
</p>
<p>is no inducement to the others to run. It is to the interest of each
</p>
<p>owner for the other boats to tie up, reducing expenses and increas-
</p>
<p>ing the net profits. It is to the interest of each to sustain extoi--
</p>
<p>tionate rates, as each shares the spoil. The public are thus de-
</p>
<p>prived of all competition and of any reasonable prospect of relief
</p>
<p>from extortionate charges, for if another boat enters the field, the
</p>
<p>boats of the combination are ready to cut prices below living rates.
</p>
<p>Competition serves the public in securing prompt, efficient car-
</p>
<p>riage, attentive, courteous treatment and reasonable prices. With-
</p>
<p>out competition it is not in the "law of carriers" to enforce care
</p>
<p>for the safety and comfort of the public, with efficient service.
</p>
<p>Such a combination therefore between carriers is prima facie at

</p>
<p>Like the enterprise of the individual the pursuit entered upon
</p>
<p>by a partnership is open to all other partnerships, and this com-
</p>
<p>bination of individuals as partners in no wav infringes upon in-
</p>
<p>dustrial liberty. It simply aids production by increasing results
</p>
<p>at reduced expense. Such combinations are in no way opposed
</p>
<p>by the law. Xor is the union of labor and capital, in the recog-
</p>
<p>nized form of a corporation, to carry on any lawful business, op-
</p>
<p>posed to public policy. Indeed in most of the states it can no
</p>
<p>longer be regarded as even in form a monopoly, much less in fact,
</p>
<p>for upon tlie same terms the right to form such corporate union
</p>
<p>is equally open to all and equally limited in its purpose and exer-
</p>
<p>cise by express statute.
</p>
<p>a. Car Trust.  Such union of persons upon car trust plan is
</p>
<p>of modern date. Tlie car trust plan, for the sale of railroad
</p>
<p>equipment, is simply to supply a company or individual with such
</p>
<p>equipment as may be wanted, on a basis of a small payment in
</p>
<p>cash at the time of delivery, and the balance, in amounts monthly,
</p>
<p>extending over a period that will result in the earning capacity
</p>
<p>of such equipment being equal to the monthly payment, and con-
</p>
<p>sequently avoiding the necessity of further advance on the orig-
</p>
<p>inal cost and it becomes the absolute property of the bailee, condi-
</p>
<p>tional vendee or lessee, after payment of all tlie monthly install-
</p>
<p>ments.
</p>
<p>Insurance is effected by the "car trust" company for mutual
</p>
<p>protection, so that no serious loss results to the vendor.
</p>
<p>The price charged for equipment on this plan, it is usually
</p>
<p>claimed, is the same as though sold on a cash basis.
</p>
<p>From this price the "car trust" company usually deducts 25
</p>
<p>per cent, to be paid in cash at the time of delivery, and to the
</p>
<p>balance adds an average of 6 per cent per annum interest, and a
</p>
<p>small commission for the use of the money, and the risk taken in
</p>
<p>the business, charged in proportion to the extent of the trust.
</p>
<p>The sum is then divided into equal amounts, payable monthly,
</p>
<p>over the desired time.

</p>
<p>The essential features of a "car trust association" consist usually
</p>
<p>of the formation of a partnersliip by an instrument of writing,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of buying, selling and leasing railroad stock to
</p>
<p>railroad corporations.
</p>
<p>These articles of association usually provide for admitting other
</p>
<p>persons to membership, who may acquire, by assignment, the in-
</p>
<p>terest held by individuals on the original formation of the part-
</p>
<p>nership.
</p>
<p>The members of a "car trust" agree to furnish money for the
</p>
<p>purchase of the rolling stock, and receive certiticates for the
</p>
<p>amount so furnished, providing that the principal sum contributed
</p>
<p>by each member shall be repaid in certain annual installments
</p>
<p>with interest; both principal and interest, where the form of lease
</p>
<p>is adopted in preference to that of sale, being payal)le only out of
</p>
<p>what are called the rentals received for the rolling stock.
</p>
<p>Under some forms of management instead of the lease, as it is
</p>
<p>called, being made to the railroad company directly by the "car
</p>
<p>trust," a plan is adopted by which the "car trust" transfers the
</p>
<p>property to a designated loan and trust company as trustee; which
</p>
<p>trustee issues certiticates to the members of the "car trust," and
</p>
<p>also executes tlie lease to the railroad company, with provisions
</p>
<p>for a rental sufficient to meet the above payments of principal and
</p>
<p>interest in addition to expenses, including taxes. In this manner,
</p>
<p>the railroad company obtaining what is called a lease of the rail-
</p>
<p>road equipment, becomes bound according to the terms of the
</p>
<p>lease to make payments which in the course of the existence of
</p>

</p>
<p>or more shares is to be entitled to a proportionate share of rentals
</p>
<p>received. The losses, if any, must be borne proportionately.
</p>
<p>In the articles organizing such associations there are provisions
</p>
<p>250 TRADE TRUSTS.
</p>
<p>made looking to the purchase of rolHng stock from time to time,
</p>
<p>and to the issue of new certificates to those who shall advance the
</p>
<p>money on the occasion of each purchase, and to the making of a
</p>
<p>new and separate lease on each lot or series of rolling stock.
</p>
<p>As such new certificates may be issued to diif erent persons from
</p>
<p>those who have contributed money for the first purchase, it would
</p>
<p>seem that the holders of each series or separate issue of shares,
</p>
<p>would, in such a case, constitute a partnership by themselves under
</p>
<p>the same provisions of management, where there is no interme-
</p>
<p>diate form between a corporation and a partnership, like the joint
</p>
<p>stock companies of England and of some of the United States,
</p>
<p>In such cases, where the association is not a corporation, its mem-
</p>
<p>l)ers must be partners, for they cannot be looked upon as simply
</p>
<p>co-owners.'
</p>
<p>Where it is permissible under the local statute, the articles of
</p>
<p>agreement provide, among other things, that only the property of
</p>
<p>the association shall be liable for its debts; the members not to be
</p>
<p>liable individually; and the affairs of the association are controlled
</p>
<p>by a committee chosen from the members.
</p>
<p>Frequently the association contracts directly with the railroad
</p>
<p>company desiring equipment, usually under the form of a lease,
</p>
<p>with a cash payment upon the delivery of the rolling stock and
</p>
<p>monthly pa^'ments thereafter, extending from one to three years,
</p>
<p>and amounting to the actual value of the equipment furnished,
</p>
<p>with a sufficient margin added to cover the interest and risk
</p>
<p>incurred. It is usually stipulated that the title shall remain in the
</p>
<p>vendor until the payment is completed.
</p>
<p>The railroad company executes a contract authorizing the car
</p>
<p>trust association to take possession of the property, upon the
</p>
<p>failure of the railroad company to pay its installments, or to keep
</p>
<p>the rolling stock in reasonable repair; and, in such case, the prop-
</p>
<p>erty is to be sold for the indebtedness remaining due and the

<p>account settled between the railroad company and the car trust

</p>
<p>lease warrants, promissory notes, or debentures, the whole trans-
</p>
<p>action forming what is commonly known as a car trust con-
</p>
<p>tract, which is transferred by the car trust association to the
</p>
<p>trustee, who indorses upon the lease warrants, notes or deben-
</p>
<p>tures that he holds, the contract as security for their payment.
</p>
<p>In otlier instances the car trust association executes its own

<p>debentures, depositing the contract, with the notes or lease war-
</p>
<p>rants given under it, with a trustee. In Pennsylvania the present

<p>sale or delivery of personal property to the vendee, coupled with
</p>
<p>an agreement that the title shall not vest in the latter unless he
</p>
<p>pays the price agreed upon, at the time appointed therefor, and
</p>
<p>that in default of such payment the vendor may recover posses-
</p>
<p>sion of the property, is held to be quite different in its effect from
</p>
<p>a baihnent for use, or, as it is sometimes called, a lease of propertv
</p>
<p>coupled with an agreement whereby the lessee may subsequently
</p>
<p>become the owner of the property, upon the payment of the price
</p>
<p>agreed upon. It is there ruled that, as between the parties to
</p>
<p>such contracts, both are valid and binding, but, as to the creditors,
</p>
<p>the latter is good while the former is invalid.'
</p>
<p>The ruling in Alabama is consistent Math this rule.' But in a
</p>
<p>aate case the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has decided that
</p>
<p>where the property is said to l)e '' leased " for a certain gross sum,
</p>
<p>with the stipulation that the title shall remain in the vendor until
</p>
<p>full payment of that sum, with a condition that possession shall
</p>
<p>revert to the vendor on any default in payment, the contract,
</p>
<p>although called a "" lease," is manifestly a sale.'
</p>
<p>Transactions of this nature are not confined to the rolling stock
</p>
<p>of railroads, but include pianos and organs, sewing machines as well
</p>
<p>as furniture. They are usuallv in the form of a lease, reservinor as
</p>
<p>rent an amount which upon the expiration of the time during which
</p>
<p>the payments run, fully covers the value of the articles sold, in addi-

<p>recorded chattel mortgage; and altliongli this is apparent upon the-
</p>
<p>face of tlie transaction, conrts have sometimes held that, if the
</p>
<p>buyer saw lit to sign the lease, he must be regarded as bailee and
</p>
<p>not as a purchaser.'
</p>
<p>But generally courts will not so construe the transaction, but
</p>
<p>regard it, not as a lease or renting, but as a conditional sale with
</p>
<p>title reserved in the vendor until the purchase price is paid.'
</p>
<p>In determining tlie real character of a contract, the courts will
</p>
<p>always look to its purpose rather than to the name given it by the
</p>
<p>parties. The transaction is not changed by assuming the form of
</p>
<p>a lease.'
</p>
<p>In Murch v. Wright, 46 111. 487, a contract of this character
</p>
<p>being under review, it was said that it was a mere subterfuge to
</p>
<p>call tlie transaction a lease.
</p>
<p>It is evident in these transactions tliat the parties do not con-
</p>
<p>template the full payment of the value, in a short period of time,
</p>
<p>for the mere use of the article said to be leased; and in all
</p>
<p>instances the sale of the article is admitted to be completed on
</p>
<p>the payment of the last installment. Such contracts are treated
</p>
<p>almost uniformly by the courts as conditional sales. It has been
</p>
<p>60 held where parties expressly contracted ''that no agreement of
</p>
<p>sale of said piano forte is implied." *

</p>
<p>-companies, with a reservation of title, possession being given,
</p>
<p>shall only be valid when the contract is in writing, signed, acknow-
</p>
<p>ledged and filed for record in the recorder's office in each county
</p>
<p>through which the railroad runs and upon which the rolling
</p>
<p>stock is to be used. Such enactments are in force in Illinois,

</p>
<p>In some states, as in Illinois, such a contract is declared to be
</p>
<p>binding only for four years and not renewable. In other states a

<p>^tock is required to have prominently placed thereon an owner-

</p>
<p>Enactments somewhat dissimilar exist in most of the other

<p>states, sometimes declaring such contract void if not recorded, as
</p>
<p>against purchaser or creditors without notice, and others denying
</p>
<p>their validity even where there has been actual notice.'

<p>There are also various provisions among the different states

<p>requirements, as tliongh tlie contract assumed the form of a sale,,
</p>
<p>in terms securing the purchase money by a chattel mortgage.
</p>
<p>In .some of the states the formaUties authorizing the recording
</p>
<p>of such an instrument are pecuHar. In New Hampshire the ven-
</p>
<p>dor and purchaser, upon a conditional sale of chattels, are required
</p>
<p>to make and subscribe an athdavit that tlie memorandum is made
</p>
<p>for the purpose of witnessing the lien and the sum due thereon, as
</p>
<p>specified in the instrument, and for no other purpose whatsoever;
</p>
<p>and that such lien and the sum due thereon were not created for
</p>
<p>the purpose of enaljling the purchaser to execute the instrument,
</p>
<p>but that the lien is a just lien, and the sum said to be due thereon is
</p>
<p>hc>nestly due and owing from the purchaser to the vendor. And
</p>
<p>under this statute a lien retained for the price, upon the condi-
</p>
<p>tional sale of chattels, is held good against an assignee in insol-
</p>
<p>vency of the conditional vendee, although the affidavit is not
</p>
<p>made entitling the instrument to record.'
</p>
<p>In the case of a conditional sale, where the statutory require-
</p>
<p>ments as to notice are strictly complied with, as no title has
</p>
<p>passed from the purchaser, there can be no lien ac(juired by sub-
</p>
<p>sequent incumbrances upon the property, nor can a title be
</p>
<p>acquired by the purchaser, except by complying with the condi-
</p>
<p>tion of a sale, unless the vendor waive such precedent condition,
</p>
<p>and whether such waiver has occurred or not is generally a ques-
</p>
<p>tion of fact for the jury." Of course if the condition as to pay-
</p>
<p>ment before the title passes be waived, the title passes to the ven-
</p>
<p>dee, and is subject to all liens against his property.^
</p>
<p>Where under a purchase it is agreed that, although the property
</p>
<p>is delivered, the title shall remain in the vendor until the price is
</p>
<p>paid, it is a conditional sale, no matter what form the transaction
</p>
<p>may assume.*

<p>It is only by express statute, that under a conditional sale,
</p>
<p>where no record of the transaction has been made, parties ignor-^
</p>
<p>ant of the title may assert their liens as against the vendor/
</p>
<p>In such eases the vendor is estopped from asserting his title, on
</p>
<p>the ground that it would operate as a traud upon the innocent
</p>
<p>purchaser, the vendor having neglected to preserve the insignia
</p>
<p>of title as required by statute.'

<p>An attempt has been made to include in the property which

<p>covered by a prior mortgage ; as well as bridges and bridge

<p>rule applicable to locomotives and cars and loose property suscep-
</p>
<p>tible of separate ownership and of separate liens, and to real estate
</p>
<p>not used for railroad purposes, as to tlieir being affected by a
</p>
<p>prior mortgage given by a railroad company covering after
</p>
<p>acquired property, it is well settled, in the decisions, that rails and
</p>
<p>other articles which become affixed to and a part of the railroad
</p>
<p>covered by a prior mortgage will be held by the lien of such
</p>
<p>mortgage, in favor of bona tide creditors, as against any contract

<p>such property passes as is indispensable to the use and enjoyment

<p>possess a separable legal interest in an elevator, it is not appur-

<p>acquired property" clause in it. The construction of the railroad

</p>

</p>
<p>stock is held subject to the liens attending its purchase. It asks
</p>
<p>the court to take possession, not alone of the railroad, but also of
</p>
<p>the rolling stock thus acquired and held. The application is not
</p>
<p>resisted. The court is ignorant of the history of the enterprise;
</p>
<p>it sustains the application and appoints a receiver, and the road is
</p>
<p>taken possession of by that receiver. It cannot be held that such
</p>
<p>possession, taken at the instance of the trustee, casts no burden on
</p>
<p>the road, either for the purchase price or rental, prior to the claim
</p>
<p>of the original mortgage,  The trustee cannot forcibly, through
</p>
<p>the power of the court, compel an aj^propriation of this rolling-
</p>
<p>stock for the benefit of its property subject to its lien, without
</p>
<p>compensation. Its application for possession carries with it an
</p>
<p>assent that at least rental for such rolling stock shall be paid as
</p>
<p>one of the expenses of the receivership, which it has invoked."

<p>"When the courts will thus equitably protect the rights of a
</p>
<p>vendor under his contract of conditional sale, it would seem
</p>
<p>reasonable that all pretenses of '"leasing" should be avoided, and
</p>
<p>the vendor stand squarely on his real contract.
</p>
<p>In England a lien upon the personal as well as real property
</p>
<p>need not be registered as a bill of sale.'
</p>
<p>But although creditors not having actual notice of an unre-
</p>
<p>corded lien, may levy upon the property in the possession of the
</p>
<p>corporation, notwitlistanding the lien creditors have instituted
</p>
<p>foreclosure proceedings,^ yet, as between the parties thereto, such
</p>
<p>unrecorded mortgage is effective and has priority over the claims
</p>
<p>of other persons who became creditors of the corporation with
</p>
<p>actual knowledge of the lien, unless the statutes expressly provide
</p>
<p>otherwise.^
</p>
<p>So a mortgage of a railway and its after acquired property
</p>
<p>will not extend to property obtained by it through fraud; so that
</p>
<p>the title thereto does not vest in it. Nor will it extend to prop-
</p>
<p>erty acquired by it illegally and without authority.*
</p>
<p>It may therefore be said that a car trust with debentures
</p>
<p>issued by the vendor, secured by the assignment to the trustee of
</p>
<p>the notes, and of a properly recorded contract of conditional sale,
</p>
<p>which does not pass the title to the vendee until full payment is
</p>
<p>made, is a safe investment, if the equipment furnished is at all in
</p>
<p>proportion to the reasonable needs of the railway company. Or
</p>
<p>such trust will be ordinarily sufficient, if resting directly upon th&
</p>
<p>notes and contract of conditional sale, without the debentures of
</p>
<p>the equipment company; as the purchaser of the notes, secured
</p>
<p>by the deposit in trust of the conditional contract, is assured that
</p>
<p>no subsequent incumbrances can attach to the equipment, and

<p>that a mortgao;e of after acquired property only attaches to such
</p>
<p>interests as the mortgagor acquires.'
</p>
<p>As the courts have, disregarding foi-ms, held contracts of lease
</p>
<p>of equipments to be " a mere subterfuge,' '" there seems no reason
</p>
<p>to cloud a legitimate transactictn of conditional sale with suspicion,
</p>
<p>by adopting the discredited disguise of a lease. Especially is this
</p>
<p>true when we notice that some of the courtc have held the parties
</p>
<p>to the form adopted by them, when the interests of justice require
</p>
<p>such a ruling/
</p>
<p>In this view the danger of such a contract becomes apparent,
</p>
<p>when it is considered that the possession under the so-called lease,
</p>
<p>with a contract of conditional sale, may be held as only taken
</p>
<p>under the lease, and if the property is destroyed before the time
</p>
<p>of transferring the title under the terms of tlie conditional sale, the
</p>
<p>latter contract may be held annulled, by reason of the failure of
</p>
<p>consideration, through the loss of the property, and the resulting
</p>
<p>inability of the vendor to deliver the property. Under such cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances a court of equity will refuse to enforce the contract of
</p>
<p>sale, holding no sufficient possession has been taken under that
</p>
<p>contract, but only under the lease.
</p>
<p>In a recent case it was ruled tliat one in possession of property
</p>
<p>under a contract to lease it at a fixed monthly rental for five years,
</p>
<p>and contracting that at the end of that time he would purchase it
</p>
<p>at a stipulated price, will not. before the expiration of tlie five years,
</p>
<p>be held to have entered under his contract to purchase fcr the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of enforcing specific perforinance against him, and in case the
</p>
<p>property is destroyed by tire w^ithin that time, his obligation to
</p>
<p>purchase is at an end.
</p>
<p>The court held that for the purpose of determining the liability
</p>
<p>of the party in possession under his agreement of lease and subse-
</p>
<p>quently to purchase, in case of the destruction of a material part
</p>
<p>of the property prior to the time for payment and conveyance,
</p>
<p>this distinction between the lease and agreement of purchase ought
</p>
<p>to be made. That a party entering under such a contract should

<p>be deemed, when the object is the enforcing of a most inequitable

<p>habihty, to have entered afid to be holding under his contract of
</p>
<p>lease, as his possession could be referred to either the lease, or to
</p>
<p>the contract of purchase, as distinct from the lease. There can be
</p>
<p>no doubt that during the term uf the lease he would hold under that.

<p>Many of the states have passed laws to prohibit combinations

<p>A contract by the owners of a railroad to be made, under an

</p>
<p>A railway company cannot transfer or lease its line unless au-
</p>
<p>thorized by statute.'
</p>
<p>By chapter 444 of 1859, the Lon^ Island Railroad Company
</p>
<p>was authorized to take a lease of any railroad that might be con-
</p>
<p>nected therewith. Held, that under this provision of the statute,
</p>
<p>a lease might be taken of a competing road, provided that, when
</p>
<p>united, the two roads were capable of forming a continuous line.^
</p>
<p>The manner of procedure against a consolidated corporation
</p>
<p>was determined in Prouty v. LaJce Shore cfc M. S. B. Co. 6 Hun,
</p>
<p>246, 64 N. Y. 641.
</p>
<p>An agreement by a steamship corporation to buy out a com-
</p>
<p>peting line which, in consideration of a monthly payment, agrees
</p>
<p>to discontinue running vessels between ports mentioned, and not
</p>
<p>to charter or sell its vessels for use on that route, and not to be-
</p>
<p>come in any way interested in the running of steamships between
</p>
<p>those places, is not void as in restraint of trade.^
</p>
<p>An agreement between plaintiff and defendant, each being a
</p>
<p>railroad company, that plaintiff would at all times deliver to de-
</p>
<p>fendant for transportation all the freight and passengers that it
</p>
<p>could lawfully control or influence, and that it would use its influ-
</p>
<p>ence to promote the interests and business of defendant comjDany
</p>
<p>as far as it could properly; that defendant would use its influence
</p>
<p>and exercise its control to promote plaintiff's interest; tliat it
</p>
<p>would make good any deficiencies of plaintiff to meet the interest
</p>
<p>upon its present bonded indebtedness; that plaintiff should cause
</p>
<p>to be deposited with defendant a majority of its capital stock; and
</p>
<p>that, so long as the management of the plahitiff company should
</p>
<p>be satisfactory to defendant, the latter would give to the repre-
</p>
<p>sentative of plaintiff the right to vote upon the stock so deposited,
</p>
<p> is not^:?er se void on the ground that it is contrary to public
</p>
<p>policy.*

<p>In many states statutes have been passed directed to combina-

<p>tions in the form of trusts, to restrict production, competition and
</p>
<p>control trade.^
</p>
<p>Under the Missouri Anti-Trust Act, as construed by the attor-
</p>
<p>ney-general of that State some 700 corporations under state charter
</p>
<p>were, Nov. 15, 1890, subject to have their charters declared revoked
</p>
<p>by the secretary of state for failure to file before that date affida-
</p>
<p>vits that they were in no way connected with a trust or combina-
</p>
<p>tion to fix prices. Every patent medicine manufactory, fixing
</p>
<p>the limit at which its goods could be resold by its vendee, came
</p>
<p>within the statute as interpreted by the attorney-general.

<p>The following is the fidl text of the anti-trust bill which has
</p>
<p>recently been passed by the Illinois Legislature and approved by
</p>
<p>the Governor, taking efiiect July 1, 1891:

<p>attempts to prevent competition by miiting the controlling cor-

<p>industry or enterprise, and placing the interest, property and

<p>power of the combination, under the control of a few individuals,

<p>COKPORATE COMBINATIONS TO PREVENT COMPETITION. 273
</p>
<p>or possibly in one hand, a trustee. This combination, in virtue of
</p>
<p>its concentration of power, can crush all competition. It reduces
</p>
<p>prices where the effort is made to compete, and when the field is
</p>
<p>clear it advances its demands, regulating the supply, not by the
</p>
<p>natural use, but by the price that can be forced from the public
</p>
<p>necessity. Like the partnership among corporations, its sole
</p>
<p>motive, the one purpose of its existence, is to obtain absolute con-
</p>
<p>trol of the market, and, unrestrained by competition, fix the price
</p>
<p>of its productions as its selfish greed may prompt it. Such com-
</p>
<p>binations are void at common law between individuals, and invade
</p>
<p>every principle of corporate existence.
</p>
<p>Indeed any corjDorate act contemjjlating any object violative of
</p>
<p>supreme law is void,' and corporations which have been formed
</p>
<p>under general laws for purposes inconsistent with the general pol-
</p>
<p>icy of the State or yet public morals, have been declared by the
</p>
<p>courts to be illegal."

</p>
<p>Agreements whereby the due performance of 2)ublic duties is

<p>endangered or prevented, are illegal."
</p>
<p>Contracts whereby corporations disable themselves from per-
</p>
<p>forming their chartered duties are void as against public policy.*
</p>
<p>A centralization of corporate franchises in a single irresponsible
</p>
<p>power furnished with every delegated facility for regulating and
</p>
<p>controlling at will, throughout the country, the production and

<p>price of a necessary article of commerce, creates a monopoly in

<p>274 TRADE TRUSTS.
</p>
<p>In People v. North River Sugar Ref. Co. the case was
</p>
<p>that seventeen corporations, in at least six diii'erent states, all
</p>
<p>engaged in the sugar refining business, arranged to transfer their
</p>
<p>stock to a board of eleven members and were to receive in return
</p>
<p>from the association shares of stock to be issued by it and to be
</p>
<p>distributed among the several corporations in proportion to the
</p>
<p>amounts of stock held by them. The profits of the business were
</p>
<p>to be divided among the holders of certificates for shares issued
</p>
<p>by the board. No limit for the duration of the association was
</p>
<p>named, and its capital stock was fixed at $50,000,000. A suit was
</p>
<p>brought by the attorney-general in the name of the people of
</p>
<p>New York against one of the associate corporations to vacate and
</p>
<p>annul its charter for '' abuse of its powers," and for exercising
</p>
<p>" privileges or franchises not conferred upon it by law" by par-
</p>
<p>ticipating '' in a combination with certain sugar refineries." Upon
</p>
<p>both grounds the court found against the defendant, and that the
</p>
<p>defendant had disabled itself from exercising its functions and
</p>
<p>employing its franchises, as it was intended it should by the Act
</p>
<p>under which it was iiicorj)orated, and had by the action which was
</p>
<p>taken placed itself in complete subordination to another and dif-
</p>
<p>ferent organization, to be used for an unlawful purpose detri.
</p>
<p>mental and injurious to the public. This was a subversion of the
</p>
<p>object for which the company was created, and it authorized the
</p>
<p>attorney-general to maintain and prosecute this action to vacate
</p>
<p>and annul its charter.
</p>
<p>It was there ruled that any combination, the tendency of which
</p>
<p>is to prevent competition in its broad and general sense and to
</p>
<p>control, and thus at will enhance, prices to the detriment of the
</p>
<p>public, is a legal monopoly. And this rule is applicable to every
</p>
<p>monopoly whether the supply be restricted by nature or suscepti-
</p>
<p>ble of indefinite production. The difticulty of efi'ecting the
</p>
<p>unlawful purpose may be greater in the one case than in the
</p>
<p>other, but it is never impossible. Nor need it be permanent or
</p>
<p>complete. It is enough that it may be even temporarily and par-

</p>
<p>tially successful. The question in the end is, does it inevitably
</p>
<p>tend to public injury?
</p>
<p>In affirming this decision the Court of Appeals declares that the
</p>
<p>evidence discloses that the defendant corporation has become an
</p>
<p>COKPOKATE OUMBINATIOXS TO TKEVENT COMPETITION. 275
</p>
<p>integral part and element of a combination which possesses over
</p>
<p>it an absolnte control, and dictates the extent and manner and
</p>
<p>terms of its entire bnsiness activity. All its stock is in the cen-
</p>
<p>tral association, denominated a "Board of Trustees," and consist-
</p>
<p>ing of only eleven individuals, who took and distributed to its
</p>
<p>own stockholders certificates of the board carrying a proportion-
</p>
<p>ate interest in what it describes as its capital stock. The defend-
</p>
<p>ant corporation has lost the power to make a dividend, and is
</p>
<p>compelled to pay over its net earnings to the master whose ser-
</p>
<p>vant it has become. Under the order of that master it has
</p>
<p>refused to refine sugar, and by so much has lessened the supj^ly
</p>
<p>upon the market. It cannot stir unless the master approves, and
</p>
<p>yet is entitled to receive from the earnings of the other refineries,
</p>
<p>amassed as profits in the treasury of the board, its pi-oportionate
</p>
<p>share for division among its own stockholders, wlio now own the
</p>
<p>substitute certificates. In return for tliis advantage it has become
</p>
<p>liable to be mortgaged, not for its own corporate benefit alone,
</p>
<p>but to supply witli funds tlie controlling board wlien that board
</p>
<p>reaches out for other coveted refineries.
</p>
<p>If what has happened is that the stockholders of this corpora-
</p>
<p>tion, one or many, sold absolutely to tlie board their entire stock,
</p>
<p>and the latter have merely chosen directors in their own interest
</p>
<p>and are managing the property as absolute owners may, then it i&
</p>
<p>difficult to see wherein the corporation has sinned or wliat it has
</p>
<p>done, more than for a time to omit to do business.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is contended that there never was a sale,
</p>
<p>but a trust constituted by mutual agreement ; that they who
</p>
<p>agreed were the whole body of stockholders, in each corporation^
</p>
<p>necessarily representing and binding the corporation itself ; that
</p>
<p>they transferred their shares to the board upon the trusts declared
</p>
<p>in the deed ; that the certificates issued by the board were the
</p>
<p>formal declaration of the trust ; that the corporate stockholders
</p>
<p>parted with the legal title of their stock to the chosen trustees
</p>
<p>with the power to vote upon it, but retained its beneficial owner-

</p>
<p>ship through the operation of the certificates, and so the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion entered into partnership with the board of control.
</p>
<p>In construing these two theories the court says that in contracts
</p>
<p>the buyer, which, in this case, was the board, should hind itself
</p>
<p>276 TRADE TRUSTS.
</p>
<p>to a contract of sale, but, according to the stockholders, this was not
</p>
<p>done, the board fixing no price. In this case the stockholders
</p>
<p>alone fixed the price and the vendees did not sign the contract,
</p>
<p>but left it to be supplied bj inference of their action. Tlie stock-
</p>
<p>holders allowed the board, however, to fix the price of the corpo-
</p>
<p>ration's personal property. In the light of these events the board
</p>
<p>was simply an agent, which is the characteristic of a trust. The
</p>
<p>miction which placed the stock in the hands of the board of trus-
</p>
<p>tees shows that no sale was intended, but simply a transfer in
</p>
<p>trust. This is also proved by the mortgage clause. 'No absolute
</p>
<p>owner requires any permission whatever to mortgage his property,
</p>
<p>but here in their contract the sup2:)osed buyers are authorized to
</p>
<p>put a mortgage on the property of this corporation. Notwith-
</p>
<p>standing that the board itself had no capital or power to mortgage
</p>
<p>]n-operty, twenty refineries are found willing to put themselves
</p>
<p>under its control. This constitutes a trust.
</p>
<p>A resume of the proceedings on the part of the corporation
</p>
<p>preparatory to its joining the trust is then given.
</p>
<p>The history shows that there was corporate action on the part
</p>
<p>of the North River Sugar Refinery Company which bound it.
</p>
<p>The corporation thus became an element of the trust. The way
</p>
<p>the companies could have jDrevented the trust being founded was
</p>
<p>by refusing to register or to recognize the illegal transfer of that
</p>
<p>stock, and they should have refused to register the transfer upon
</p>
<p>their books, appealing to the law to sustain them, thus shattering
</p>
<p>the trust at the outset of its career. To_ be lawful all corporate
</p>
<p>acts should have been done by all of the various company stock-
</p>
<p>holders and trustees instead of by the board of trustees alone.
</p>
<p>The question to be determined is whether the conduct of the
</p>
<p>defendant in aiding to form the trust was illegal. In all of these
</p>
<p>points which have been reviewed it is found that the corporation
</p>
<p>was doing the public an injury, and in avoiding the state law
</p>
<p>which compels reservation of corporate rights had proved unfaith-
</p>
<p>ful to its charter. It is a violation of law for a corporation to

<p>and not have remained in existence as in this case. The present
</p>
<p>corporation or trnst puts upon the market a capital stock proudly
</p>
<p>defiant of actual values and capable of unlimited expansion. It
</p>
<p>is one thing for the State to respect the rights of ownership and
</p>
<p>quite another thing to add to tlie possibility of a further extension
</p>
<p>of those consequences by creating artificial authority in the man-
</p>
<p>agement of such aggregations. If corporations can combine and
</p>
<p>mass their forces in a solid trust with little added risk to capital
</p>
<p>already in, without limit to magnitude, a tempting and easy road
</p>
<p>is open to enormous combinations vastly exceeding in number
</p>
<p>and strength any possibilities of individual ownership. The State
</p>
<p>seeks to protect individuals rather than combinations.
</p>
<p>It is concluded that the defendant corporation has violated its
</p>
<p>charter and failed in the performance of its corporate duties,
</p>
<p>and that in respect so material and important as to justify a judg-
</p>
<p>ment of dissolution. Without either approval or disapproval of
</p>
<p>the views expressed by the court below it was decided that in
</p>
<p>that State there can be no partnersliips of separate and independ-
</p>
<p>ent corporations, whether directly or indirectly, through the
</p>
<p>medium of a trust, no substantial consolidations, which avoid and
</p>
<p>disregard tlie statutory provisions and restraints ; but that manu-
</p>
<p>facturing corporations must be and remain several as they were
</p>
<p>created, or one under the statute.'
</p>
<p>In a recent case, that of People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co.
</p>
<p>8 L. R. A. 497, 130 111. 268, the trust combination consisted of a
</p>
<p>new corporation holding a separate charter under the General
</p>
<p>Incorporation Law of Illinois. In applying for its charter the Gas
</p>
<p>Trust Company stated the objects of its incorporation to be " the

<p>erection and operation of works in Chicago and otlier places in
</p>
<p>Illinois for the manufacture, sale, and distribution of gas and
</p>
<p>electricity; and to purchase and hold or sell the capital stock of

<p>any gas or electric company or companies in Chicago or elsewhere

<p>Xot only is such an incorporation for sucli an illegal purpose
</p>
<p>void, but such a trust is ineffective and null in its inception and

<p>in itself, under the law of trusts, for in pari delicto melior est
</p>
<p>conditio possidentis, et defendentis, is a maxim of public policy
</p>
<p>equally respected in courts of law and courts of equity, and the
</p>
<p>cunning of counsel cannot so cover a transaction under the mantle
</p>
<p>of a trust, which is in fact against public morals or public policy,

<p>that equity will not disclose the concealed iniquity.*
</p>
<p>And when tlie illegal purpose is disclosed, whether the shelter
</p>
<p>be under form of partnership of individuals, or of corporations,
</p>
<p>the grasp of a court of equity will be equally powerful to control

<p>when its purposes are contrary to sound morality and jiublic

<p>is within the reach of a court of equity.

</p>
<p>ing itself without express authority of law in another corporation.
</p>
<p>Thus, gas companies, being engaged in a business of a public
</p>
<p>character, are charged with the performance of public duties.
</p>
<p>Their use of the streets whose fee is held by the municipal cor-
</p>
<p>poration, in trust for the benefit of the public, has been likened to-
</p>
<p>the exercise of the power of eminent domain.'
</p>
<p>In Glhhs V. Consolidated Gas Co. 130 U. S. 396, 32 L. ed. 979,
</p>
<p>the Supreme CfMirt of the United States, in an able opinion delivered
</p>
<p>by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, uses these words: "These gas com-
</p>
<p>panies entered the streets of Baltimore under their charters, in the
</p>
<p>exercise of tlie equivalent of the power of eminent domain, and
</p>
<p>are to be held as having assumed an obligation to fulfill the public
</p>
<p>purposes to subserve which they were incorporated."
</p>
<p>The privileges awarded to the gas companies under their respec-
</p>
<p>tive charters were given them in return for and in considerati(n
</p>
<p>of services to be rendered by them to the public. When they
</p>
<p>entered the streets they assumed the performance of the public
</p>
<p>duty of furnishing Hglit to the inhabitants. That they should be
</p>
<p>permitted or required or forced to aljandon the performance of
</p>
<p>such public duty is against the policy of the law. The public duty
</p>
<p>is imposed upon each company separately, and not upon them com-
</p>
<p>bined. Each for itself, when it accepted tlie articles of associa-
</p>
<p>tion, assumed an obligation to perform the objects of its incor-
</p>
<p>poration. But the corporation which stands for the combined
</p>
<p>corporations, through the control which it does or may exercise
</p>
<p>over the companies by reason of its ownership of a majority of
</p>
<p>their stock, renders it impossible for them to discharge their pub-
</p>
<p>lic duties, except at the dictation of an outside force, and in the
</p>
<p>manner prescribed by a corporation operating independently of
</p>
<p>them. They are thus virtually forced to abandon the performance
</p>
<p>of their dut}^ to the public. Tiie freedom and effectiveness of
</p>
<p>their action in carrying out the purposes of their creation are
</p>
<p>seriously interfered with, if not actually destroyed. A power

</p>
<p>An agreement between corporations engaged in the manufac-
</p>
<p>ture of cotton-seed oil, to select a committee from each corpora-
</p>
<p>tion, and to turn over to this committee the properties, including
</p>
<p>the entire operative machinery of each company, to be managed
</p>
<p>and operated for a specified term by the committee, for the com-
</p>
<p>mon benefit, the profits and losses to be shared in agreed propor-
</p>
<p>tions, is not a mere "traffic arrangement," but a contract of
</p>
<p>partnership, which is ultra vires and consequently void so far as
</p>
<p>it is unexecuted, even though it be authori/x'd by both shareholders
</p>
<p>and directors.*
</p>
<p>It is tlie general rule that corporate franchises are granted upon
</p>
<p>a trust or condition that the corp(rate privileges shall not be
</p>
<p>abused; that the corporation undertakes and agrees, upon condi-
</p>
<p>tion of forfeiture, that it will so manage and conduct is affairs that
</p>
<p>it shall not become dangerous or hazardous to the safety of the
</p>
<p>State or community in and with which it transacts business;" and
</p>
<p>that the francliise may be forfeited and the corporation dissolved
</p>
<p>for acts ultra vires, or for breach of the trust condition and per-
</p>
<p>version of the objects of the grant/
</p>
<p>But to warrant a forfeiture of franchise for misuser, the misuser
</p>
<p>must be such as to work or tlnvatcn a substantial injury to the
</p>
<p>public.
</p>
<p>A corporation violating the Organic Law forfeits its franchise,
</p>
<p>but does not thereby become subject to the escheat or confiscation
</p>
<p>of its prctperty.*
</p>
<p>To justify such forfeiture the vltra vires acts must be so sub-
</p>
<p>stantial and continued as to so derange or destroy the business of
</p>
<p>the corporation that it no longer fulfills the end for which it was-

<p>of the intended incorporation, the Act authorizing it would be as
</p>
<p>void as would be that of a State, in eharterinii; a cor])oration to
</p>
<p>resist the authority of the general government.'
</p>
<p>Centainly no special charter was ever granted to create a com-
</p>
<p>bination to rob the public by destroying competition in j)roduction
</p>
<p>or sale. General statutes do not ctjutcmplate or autliorize the
</p>
<p>organization of a corpt^ration for such a purpose.
</p>
<p>Since a sugar-retining company organized to create a trust or
</p>
<p>monopoly is unlawful, the franchises of a refining comi)any are
</p>
<p>subject to forfeiture if it surrenders its business to such monopoly
</p>
<p>and becomes a party to the trust."
</p>
<p>It is a condition on which a corporation is allowed to be created
</p>
<p>and maintained that it shall exercise and use its franchises for the
</p>
<p>benefit of the puldic. And when it voluntarily declines to do
</p>
<p>that, or places itself in a situation in which that may be prevented
</p>
<p>as a consecpience of its voluntary action, under the statute, as well
</p>
<p>as the decisions of the courts, its charter may be annulled. If it
</p>
<p>has disabled itself for exercising its functions and employing its
</p>
<p>franchises as it was intended it should by the Act under which it
</p>
<p>was incorporated, and has placed itself in complete subordination
</p>
<p>to another and different organization to be used for an unlawful
</p>
<p>juivpose, detrimental and injurious to the public; if instead of
</p>
<p>manufacturing its product and disposing of it to the public on
</p>
<p>what might be fair competitive prices, it has become a party to a
</p>
<p>combination, in part, at least, designed to create a monopoly and
</p>
<p>exact from the public prices which could not otherwise be obtained,
</p>
<p>this is a subversion of the object for which the company was cre-
</p>
<p>ated and it authonzes the attorney-general to maintain and pros-
</p>
<p>ecute an action to vacate and annul its charter.^

<p>Indeed it may well be questioned whether it is not against the
</p>
<p>"[policy of the State creating a corporation and giving its stock-
</p>
<p>holders power to vote their stock, to permit them to deprive
</p>
<p>themselves of that power by placing the stock in a trust, M'ith
</p>
<p>power in the trustee to vote the stuck for any detiuite or indetiiiite
</p>
<p>period. It is the policy of the law that ownership of stock shall
</p>
<p>control the property and management of the corporation, and this
</p>
<p>cannot be accom]>lishcd, and this good policy is defeated, if stock-
</p>
<p>holders are permitted to surrender all their discretion and will in
</p>
<p>the important matter of voting and suffer themselves to be the
</p>
<p>passive instruments in the hands of some agent, who has no inter-
</p>
<p>est in the stock, equitable or legal, and no interest in the general
</p>
<p>prosperity of the corporation. This personal right to vote his
</p>
<p>stock is not given entirely for the protection of tlie stockholder
</p>
<p>himself, but it e(pially protects the interest of every stockholder,
</p>
<p>when each discharges the duty each owes his fellow stockholder,
</p>
<p>to use such power and means as the law and his o\\Tiership of
</p>
<p>stock gives him, so tliat the general interest of the stockholders is
</p>
<p>promoted and protected, and the general welfare of the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion is sustained, and tlie business conducted by its agents, man-
</p>
<p>agers and oftieers, so far as may l)e upon prudent and honest
</p>
<p>principles of business and with just as little temptation to and
</p>
<p>opportunity for fraud, and the seeking of individual gains, at the
</p>
<p>saciitice of the general welfare of the corporation, as is possible.'
</p>
<p>The Ciise is far stronger whei-e the voting trust is with trustees,
</p>
<p>whose personal interests in any way are hostile to the interests of
</p>
<p>the stockholders, as stockholders of the corporation whose stock

</p>
<p>When underlying a pooling contract, there is between the mem-

<p>enters into this pooling contract, and forms the object of its crea-

<p>principles of law governing the dealings of trustees with trust
</p>
<p>property and their cestuis que trust. ^ Tlie union of corporations-
</p>

</p>
<p>The purpose for which a corporation is formed under general

</p>
<p>to purchase all the shares in other corporations competing with

<p>article, is not an organization for a lawful purpose, and all acts
</p>
<p>done towards tlie accomplishment of such object are illegal and

<p>void. The word "unlawful," as applied to corporations, is not

<p>used exclusively in the sense of malum in se or nialiirn proldhl.

</p>
<p>The business of manufacturing and distributing illuminating
</p>
<p>gas, by means of pipes laid in the streets of a city, is a business of
</p>
<p>a public character. It is the exercise of a franchise lelonging to
</p>
<p>the State. The services rendered and to be rendered for such a
</p>
<p>grant are of a public nature. Companies engaged in such business
</p>
<p>owe a duty to the public. Any unreasonable restraint upon the
</p>
<p>performance of such duty is prejudicial to the public interest, and
</p>
<p>in contravention of public policy."
</p>
<p>AVhatever tends to prevent competition between those engaged
</p>
<p>in a public employment or business impressed with a public char-
</p>
<p>acter is opposed to public policy, and therefore unlaM'ful. What-

<p>ever tends to create a monopoly is unlawful, as being contrary to
</p>
<p>public policy.*

</p>
<p>delivered by 2li\ Justice Craig, it was said: "We understand it to
</p>
<p>be a well settled rule of law that an agreement in general restraint
</p>
<p>of trade is contrary to public policy, illegal and void. . . .
</p>
<p>Whatever is injurious to the interest of the public is void on the
</p>
<p>ground of public policy."
</p>
<p>In Central Ohio Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Ohio St. QQQ, the Su-
</p>
<p>preme Court of Ohio said: ''Public policy unquestionably favors
</p>
<p>competition in trade, to the end that its commodities may be
</p>
<p>afforded to the consumer as cheaply as possible, and is opposed to
</p>
<p>monopolies, which tend to advance market prices to the injury of
</p>
<p>the general pul)lic."
</p>
<p>It is the duty of the judiciary to refuse to sustain that which is
</p>
<p>against the public policy of the State, when such public policy is
</p>
<p>manifested by the legislation or fundamental law of the State.'
</p>
<p>It is, in most states, provided that the common law of England,
</p>
<p>60 far as the same is applicable and of a general nature, shall be
</p>
<p>the rule of decision, and shall be considered of full force until
</p>
<p>repealed by legislative authority. PubHc policy is that principle
</p>
<p>of law which holds that no subject or citizen can lawfully do that
</p>
<p>which has a tendency to be injurious to the public, or against the
</p>
<p>73ublic good. This principle owes its existence to the very sources
</p>
<p>from wdiich the common law is supplied.'
</p>
<p>The common law will not permit individuals to oblige them-
</p>
<p>selves by a contract either to do or not to do anytliing, when the
</p>
<p>thing to be done or omitted is in any degree clearly injurious to
</p>
<p>the public'
</p>
<p>In Stanton v. Allen, 5 Denio, 434, an agreement, whose ten-
</p>
<p>dency was to prevent competition, was held to be void by the
</p>
<p>principles of the common law, because it was against public policy,
</p>
<p>and injurious to the interests of the State. "Contracts creatino-
</p>
<p>monopolies are null and void as being contrary to public policy."*
</p>
<p>All grants creating monopolies are made void by the common
</p>
<p>law.'

</p>
<p>In the Case of the Monopolies, 11 Coke, 84, it was decided, as-
</p>
<p>long ago as the forty-fourth year of tlie reign of Qneen Elizabeth,
</p>
<p>that a ""grant to the plaintiff of the sole making of cards within
</p>
<p>the realm was utterly void, and that for two reasons: (1) that it is
</p>
<p>a monopoly, and against the common law; (2) that it is against
</p>
<p>divers acts of Parliament," etc'
</p>
<p>Corporations can only exercise such powers as may be conferred
</p>
<p>by the legislative body creating them, either in express terms or
</p>
<p>by necessary implication; and the implied powers are presumed
</p>
<p>to exist to enable such bodies to carry out the express power:>
</p>
<p>granted, and to accomplish the purposes of their creation,*
</p>
<p>An incidental power is one that is directly and immediately
</p>
<p>appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted, aud
</p>
<p>not one that has a slight or remote relation to it/
</p>
<p>Where a charter, in express terms, confers upon a corporation
</p>
<p>the power to maintain and operate works for the manufacture and
</p>
<p>sale of gas, it is not a necessary implication therefrom that the
</p>
<p>power to purchase stock in other gas companies should also exist.
</p>
<p>Tliere is no necessary connection between manufacturing gas and
</p>
<p>buying stocks. If the purpose for wliich a gas comjDany has been
</p>
<p>created is to make and sell gas and operate gas-works, the pur-
</p>
<p>chase of stock in other gas companies is not necessary to accom-
</p>
<p>plish such purpose. "The right of a corporation to invest in
</p>
<p>shares of another company cannot be implied, because both com-
</p>
<p>panies are engaged in a similar kind of business."*
</p>
<p>It is true that a gas company might take the stock of another
</p>
<p>corporation in payment of a debt, or perhaps as security for a
</p>
<p>debt; but the actual purchase of such stock is not directly and
</p>
<p>immediately appropriate to the execution of a specifically granted
</p>
<p>power to operate gas-works and manufacture gas. Some corpo-
</p>
<p>rations, like insurance companies, may find it necessary to keep
</p>
<p>funds on hand for the payment of losses by death or fire, or to
</p>
<p>meet other necessary demands; but it is questionable whether

<p>even these can invest their surphis funds in the stocks of other
</p>
<p>corporations without special legislative authority. But there is
</p>
<p>nothing in the nature of a gas company which renders it proper
</p>
<p>for such a company to accumulate funds for outside investment.
</p>
<p>Its surplus profits belong to the stockholders, and, when distributed
</p>
<p>among them, can be used by them as they see fit.
</p>
<p>If, then, the power to purchase outside stocks cannot be im-
</p>
<p>plied from the power to operate gas-works, and make and sell gas,
</p>
<p>a company to whom the latter power has been exj^ressly granted
</p>
<p>cannot exercise the former without legislative authority to do so.
</p>
<p>This is the law, as settled by the great weight of authority..
</p>
<p>Boone, on the Law of Corporations, says : " Without a power
</p>
<p>specifically granted or necessarily implied, a corporation cannot
</p>
<p>become a stockholder in another corporation, and especially where
</p>
<p>the object is to obtain the control or atfect the management of the
</p>
<p>latter."  107.
</p>
<p>In Green's Brice's Ultra Vires (p. 91, note h) it is said : " In,
</p>
<p>the United States a corporation cannot become a stockholder in
</p>
<p>another corporation unless by power specifically granted by its
</p>
<p>charter, or necessarily implied in it."
</p>
<p>So, also, 1 Morawetz on Private Corporations (^ 431, 433)
</p>
<p>says : " A corporation has no implied right to purchase shares in
</p>
<p>another company for the purpose of controlling its management.
</p>
<p>. . . A corporation cannot, in the absence of express statutory
</p>
<p>authority, become an incorporator by subscribing for shares in a
</p>
<p>new corporation, nor can it do this indirectly, through persons act-
</p>
<p>ing as its agents or tools."
</p>
<p>The authorities referred to by these text-writers sustain the
</p>
<p>conclusions announced by them. It has been held in many cases
</p>
<p>that " in the United States corporations cannot purchase or hold
</p>
<p>or deal in the stocks of other corporations, unless expressly author-
</p>
<p>ized to do so by law;" and that "one corporation cannot
</p>
<p>become the owner of any portion of the capital stock of another
</p>
<p>corporation, unless authority to become such is clearly conferred

<p>]^or will tlie fact that a corporation is or2:anized under a gen-
</p>
<p>eral act of incorporation authorize such purchase. The only
</p>
<p>powers granted by such acts are the ordinary corporate powers,
</p>
<p>such as the rights to be bodies corporate and politic, to sue and be
</p>
<p>sued, to have a common seal, etc.
</p>
<p>The charter of a corporation formed under such a general law
</p>
<p>does not consist of the articles of association alone, but of such
</p>
<p>articles taken in connection with the law under which the organi-
</p>
<p>zation takes place.' The provisions of the law enter into and
</p>
<p>form a part of the charter. It certainly cannot be true that a
</p>
<p>corporation formed under a general incorporation act, for a pur-
</p>
<p>pose other than that of dealing in stocks, can exercise the power
</p>
<p>of purchasing and holding stock in other corporations, where such
</p>
<p>power cannot be necessarily implied from the nature of the power
</p>
<p>speciiically granted, and is not necessary to carry the latter into
</p>
<p>effect. The power to purchase and hold stock in other companies
</p>
<p>must be the subject of legislative grant, if not in all cases, at least
</p>
<p>in cases where it cannot be implied from the powers expressly
</p>
<p>granted. General incorporation laws contain no grant of such
</p>
<p>power. Can a corporation organized under that law be clothed
</p>
<p>with such a power by merely naming it in the statement filed
</p>
<p>with the secretary of state? Clearly not. The action of the
</p>
<p>secretary of state in issuing the license and the certificate of organi-
</p>
<p>zation is necessarily, to a large extent, merely mhiisterial.^
</p>
<p>Where the organization is for the purpose of erecting gas
</p>
<p>works and making and selling gas, that being the main purpose
</p>
<p>for which the corporation was formed, the incorporators could
</p>
<p>not tack on and connect with such main purpose the power to
</p>
<p>buy and hold stock in other gas companies, by merely describing
</p>
<p>such power in the statement. To hold that they could confer
</p>
<p>such power by writing it down in the statement would be to hold
</p>
<p>that the Legislature could clothe them with a part of its legislative
</p>
<p>functions. When a corporation is formed under a general incor-
</p>

<p>It has been held that the powers obtained bj the corporations

</p>
<p>with his fellows, all attempts to oppress and injure the individual
</p>

<p>It was early recognized, that the power of many united for mis-
</p>
<p>chief against one is so great, that the law should protect him.^
</p>
<p>To guard against the union of numbers to effect an unlawful
</p>
<p>design is not easy and to punish the offenders is often difficult.
</p>
<p>The unlawful confederacy is therefore punished to prevent the
</p>
<p>doing of any act in execution of it.^

</p>
<p>The offense of conspiracy being therefore violative of the prin-

<p>143, and 1 Hawk, P. C. 193, chap. 72,  9, it is said that the "vil-
</p>
<p>lenous" judgment is given by common law and not by any statute
</p>
<p>against those convicted of a conspiracy. As this "villenous" judg-
</p>
<p>ment was known only to the common law, it could only follow a
</p>
<p>common law offense. In the 20th year of Edward I., a civil rem-
</p>
<p>edy was provided against conspirators, etc., by the writ of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; and the Statute 28 Edw. I., chap. 10, entitled " The
</p>
<p>Remedy against Conspirators, False Informers and Embracers of
</p>
<p>Juries" makes this further provision: "In right of conspirators,
</p>
<p>false informers, and evil procurers of dozens, assizes and juries,
</p>
<p>the king hath provided remedy for the plaintiffs by writ out of
</p>

</p>
<p>bench and of the other, and justices assigned to take assises, when

<p>COMMON LAW ORIGIN OF OFFENSE OF CONSPIRACY. 293
</p>
<p>Edward I. for the writ of conspiracy, there being no other, and
</p>
<p>this according to 2 Inst. 562, was but an affirmance of the
</p>
<p>common law; and these provisions for private remedies against
</p>
<p>conspirators clearly admit the existence of the offense of conspi-
</p>
<p>racy at common law. But the statute itself in defining who are
</p>
<p>conspirators in certain cases, without declaring the conspiracy un-
</p>
<p>lawful, or forbidding it, or providing a punishment therefor,
</p>
<p>plaiidy recognized the prior existence of the crime and its punish-
</p>
<p>ment at common law. Nor does the statute cover all conspiracies
</p>
<p>at common law,  as conspiracies to commit a felony or a misde-
</p>
<p>meanor, nor is the statute prohibitory, nor is tlie existence of
</p>
<p>other punishable conspiracies than those it enumerates in any way
</p>
<p>repugnant to or inconsistent with any of its provisions.
</p>
<p>The case of Breerton v. Townsend., Noy's Rep. 103, for the
</p>
<p>suppression of a will, in which the parties were punished by fine,
</p>
<p>also shows that the villenous judgment was not given in all cases
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, but that there were at common law different de-
</p>
<p>grees of punishment, and consequently of crime; and in 1 Hawk,
</p>
<p>P. C. 193, chap. 72,  9, it is said that it has never been settled
</p>
<p>to be the proper judgment upon any conviction of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>except such as threatening the life of the party, which obviates any
</p>
<p>argument drawn from the villenous judgment, against there being
</p>
<p>any other conspiracies at common law than those enumerated in
</p>
<p>the statute 33 Edward I. The statute is rather by way of super-
</p>
<p>adding to tlie offenses at common law. This is shown by the ac-
</p>
<p>tion of the courts again and again in the early cases, in overruling
</p>
<p>the objection that the offense for which the defendants were on
</p>
<p>trial was not one named in the statute.
</p>
<p> 61. Common Law Origin of Offense of Conspiracy. As it
</p>
<p>Appears from Precedents and Decisions.  In the Book of
</p>
<p>Assises, 27 Edward III., chap. M, it is said that "inquiry shall be
</p>
<p>made concerning conspirators and confederates, who bind them-
</p>
<p>selves by oath, covenant or other agreement, that each will sup-
</p>
<p>port the enterprises of the other whether true or false." And in

<p>another place it is stated: "And note that two were indicted for a
</p>
<p>confederacy, each of them to maintain the other, whether the
</p>
<p>matter be true or false; and notwithstanding that nothing was
</p>
<p>294 CONSPIEACY AT COMMON LAW.
</p>
<p>alleged to have been actually done, the parties were put to answer
</p>
<p>because it was a thing forbidden by law."*
</p>
<p>Clearly this offense does not fall within the Statute 33 Edward
</p>
<p>I., but under common law."
</p>
<p>And it does not charge a conspiracy to commit the common law
</p>
<p>offense of "maintainance." That is dehned as an officious inter-
</p>
<p>meddling in a suit that no way belongs to one, by maintaining or
</p>
<p>assisting either party, with money or otherwise, to prosecute or
</p>
<p>defend his action. "The offense is against public justice . . .
</p>
<p>and perverts the remedial process of the law into an engine of
</p>
<p>opj)ression.'"
</p>
<p>It is the assisting of another person in a lawsuit, without having
</p>
<p>any privity or concern in the subject.*
</p>
<p>The intermeddling of a stranger in a suit for the purpose of
</p>
<p>stirring up and continuing the litigation."
</p>
<p>The actual offense charged in the case stated in the note was
</p>
<p>the "agreement that each will support the enterprises of the other
</p>
<p>whether true or false," not the lawsuits of the other, for it does
</p>
<p>not appear that either had actions pending or to be brought, and
</p>
<p>it does not affirmatively appear that "nothing was alleged to have
</p>
<p>been actually done," and therefore the offense could n( t have
</p>
<p>been made out if the charge was simply "maintenance," for that
</p>
<p>consists in actually doing the thing  "maintaining or assisting
</p>
<p>either party, with money or otherwise to prosecute or defend' 
</p>
<p>not in conspiring or agreeing to do it. Indeed it has been ex-
</p>
<p>pressly decided that a parent might uphold his child, and a mas-
</p>
<p>ter assist his servant, in a lawsuit (1 Bl. Com. 429, 450), without
</p>
<p>being guilty of maintainance. It required no decision to hold
</p>
<p>them harmless, for sustaining those thus connected with them, in
</p>
<p>ordinary enterprises. That the "^7^07^" case in the year 1354
</p>
<p>was not one charging a conspiracy for " maintenance" clearly aj)-
</p>
<p>pears from the language used in referring to it two hundred and

</p>
<p>fiftj-seven years later in the year 1611 in The Poulterer'' s Case,
</p>
<p>9 Rep. 55, Moore, 814, where the defendants, poulterers of Lon-
</p>
<p>don, were indicted for a combination and confederacy falsely and
</p>
<p>maliciously to charge the plaintiff with the robbery of one of the
</p>
<p>defendants, and to procure him to be indicted, convicted and
</p>
<p>hanged, and although the grand jury found ignoramus, yet it was
</p>
<p>held that although a writ of conspiracy lies not unless the party
</p>
<p>is indicted, and legitimo modo acquietdtus, for so are the words
</p>
<p>of the writ; but that a false conspiracy betwixt divers persons shall
</p>
<p>be punished, although nothing be put in execution, is full and
</p>
<p>manifest in the books; and therefore, in 27 Bk. Assizes, p. 44, in the
</p>
<p>"Articles of the Charge of Enquiry by the Enquest in the King's
</p>
<p>Bench," there is a nota, that two were indicted for confederacy,
</p>
<p>each of them to maintain the other, whether their matters be true
</p>
<p>or false, and notwithstanding that nothing was supposed to be put
</p>
<p>in execution, the parties were forced to answer to it, because the
</p>
<p>thing is forbidden by law, which are the very words of the book;
</p>
<p>which proves that such false confederacy is forbidden by the law,
</p>
<p>although it was not put in use or executed. So there in the next
</p>
<p>articles in the same book, inquiry shall be made of conspirators
</p>
<p>and confederates who agree amongst themselves, etc., falsely, to
</p>
<p>indict, or acquit, etc., the manner of agreement and betwixt whom;
</p>
<p>which proves also that confederacy to indict or acquit, although
</p>
<p>nothing is executed, is punishable by law; and there is another
</p>
<p>article concerning conspiracy between merchants, and in these
</p>
<p>cases the conspiracy or confederacy is punishable although the
</p>
<p>conspiracy or confederacy be not executed; and it is held in 19 E..
</p>
<p>2 Brief, 926, a man shall have a writ of conspiracy, although they
</p>
<p>do nothing but conspire together and he shall recover damages
</p>
<p>and they may be also indicted therefor. Also the usual commis-
</p>
<p>sion of oyer and terminer gives power to the commissioners to
</p>
<p>inquire, etc., de omnibus coadunationihus, confcederatioiiihus,
</p>

<p>falsa alUga7itia is a false binding each to the other, by bond or
</p>
<p>promise, to execute some unlawful act. In these cases before the
</p>
<p>unlawful act is executed, the law punishes the coadjunction, con-
</p>
<p>federacy or false alliance, to the end to prevent the unlawful act,
</p>
<p>296 CONSPIKACY AT COMMON LAW.
</p>
<p>quia quando aliquid prohibetur, prohibetur et id per quod per-
</p>
<p>mnitur ad illud; et effectus punitiir licit non sequatur effectus;
</p>
<p>and in these cases the common law is a law of mercy, for it pre-
</p>
<p>vents the malignant from doing mischief, and the innocent from
</p>
<p>suffering it. And afterwards upon hearing of the case and upon
</p>
<p>pregnant proofs the defendants were sentenced for such false
</p>
<p>conspiracy by fine and imprisonment.
</p>
<p>To this case is a note by Lord Coke, " that these confederacies,
</p>
<p>punishable by law, before they are executed, ought to have four
</p>
<p>incidents : 1. It ought to be declared by some manner of prose-
</p>
<p>cution, as in this case it was, either by making of bonds, or prom-
</p>
<p>ises one to another. 2. It ought to be malicious, as for unjust
</p>
<p>revenge, etc. 3. It ought to be false, against an innocent. 4. It
</p>
<p>ought to be out of court voluntarily."
</p>
<p>If the indictment in the Anon. Case, 1354, 27 Assizes, p. 138, b.
</p>
<p>pi. 44, falls within either of the provisions of the Statute 33 Edw. I.,
</p>
<p>it can only be that which relates to the moving and maintaining
</p>
<p>pleas, and that does not embrace it ; for if the indictment had
</p>
<p>been under the statute, for a confederacy " falsely to move and
</p>
<p>maintain pleas," of course in a court, the parties must have gone
</p>
<p>aquit, for no such purpose was charged. The indictment was not
</p>
<p>however under the statute for either of the specific acts mentioned
</p>
<p>in it, but at common law for the conspiracy, which was considered
</p>
<p>per se a substantive offense, no act in furtherance of it being
</p>
<p>alleged, and this after and notwithstanding the statute. From
</p>
<p>the positions that "a confederacy each to maintain the other,
</p>
<p>whether the matter be true or false," is a common law offense;
</p>
<p>that conspiracies are punishable at common law, though nothing
</p>
<p>be put in execution; and that the law punishes the conspiracy " to
</p>
<p>the end to prevent the unlawful act," and, referring to the com-
</p>
<p>binations among merchants to regulate the price of wool, that
</p>
<p>" the conspiracy or confederacy (not the false conspiracy or con-
</p>
<p>federacy) is punishable, although the conspiracy or confederacy
</p>
<p>be- not executed," it is clear that the nota at the end of the

<p>case of The Poulterers, which it has been frequently claimed
</p>
<p>states the rule, that both malice and falsehood are indispensable
</p>
<p>ingredients of a punishable conspiracy, and must be united in the
</p>
<p>same case, was not intended by Lord Coke as applicable to all

</p>
<p>confederacies, but to such conspiracies only as are of the character
</p>
<p>of those of which he had treated immediately preceding tiie
</p>
<p>nota ; for he does not speak of the case of a conspiracy be-
</p>
<p>tween merchants to fix the price of wool as a false conspiracy,
</p>
<p>nor does either falsehood or malice necessarily enter into such a
</p>
<p>combination. And these combinations among merchants (which
</p>
<p>are not within the Statute 33 Edward I.) were, and remain pun-
</p>
<p>ishable at common law, and were not first made so by the Statute
</p>
<p>Staple, 27 Edward III., chap. 9. That statute does indeed pro-
</p>
<p>hibit the exportation of wool under a very severe penalty, but
</p>
<p>neither creates, nor provides a punishment for the oiiense by mer-
</p>
<p>chants of combining to fix a price beyond which they would not
</p>
<p>go. All that is said in relation to the purchasing of wool is, that
</p>
<p>" all merchants, as well subjects as foreigners, may purchase wool-
</p>
<p>folk, etc., throughout the whole of our kingdom and territory
</p>
<p>without covin or collusion to lower the price of the said merchan-
</p>
<p>dizes, so nevertheless as they bring them to the staple," from
</p>
<p>which it would seem that all covin and collusion to lower the
</p>
<p>price of merchandize was before unlawful, and that the statute
</p>
<p>intended to leave the law as it was.
</p>
<p>The Act of 7 and 8 Yict. chap. 24, rejDcaling the statutes relat-
</p>
<p>ing to forestalling, engrossing and regrating, and abolishing them
</p>
<p>also as common law offenses, seems to recognize the existence of
</p>
<p>the common law crime of "knowingly and fraudulently spreading
</p>
<p>or conspii'ing to spread any false rumor with intent to inhance or
</p>
<p>destroy the price of any goods, wares or merchandise being
</p>
<p>brought to any fair or market," and it excepts such offense from
</p>
<p>the force of the repealing Act.
</p>
<p>In The Poulterers Case it was plainly considered an offense at
</p>
<p>common law ; and in 4 Bl. Com. 154, the exportation of wool,
</p>
<p>which, as before stated, was prohibited by the statute staple,
</p>
<p>under a very heavy penalty, is said to have been forbidden at
</p>
<p>common law, but more particularly by that statute ; and if that
</p>
<p>which it was the principal object of the statute to prevent and to

</p>
<p>punish, was before an offense at common law, it may readily be
</p>
<p>supposed that no new offense was intended to be created ; but
</p>
<p>that a conspiracy to fix the price of wool was an offense at com-
</p>
<p>mon law. Moreover the words of the statute are "without covin
</p>
<p>298 CONSPIRACY AT COMMON LAW.
</p>
<p>or collusion to lower the price," etc., and a combination to " fix a
</p>
<p>price, beyond which they would not go," does not necessarily
</p>
<p>include the offense "to lower" the price. Breerton v. Townsend,
</p>
<p>JS'oy's Rep. 103, states an information against Breerton, Town-
</p>
<p>send, and others, for the suppression of a will under a confedera-
</p>
<p>tion, although the act by one was not indictable. The injury in
</p>
<p>that case was to the relator, whose wife was thereby disinherited.
</p>
<p>In Timberley and Childe (or Kimberty) 1663, 1 Siderlin, (j^, the
</p>
<p>indictment was held good, for a conspiracy to charge one with being
</p>
<p>the father of a bastard child, with intent to extort money from
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>So in Kioig v. Tymlirly, 1 Keble, 254, a judgment was rested
</p>
<p>upon two distinct grounds; that it is a conspiracy for lucre and gain
</p>
<p>to charge and disgrace a man with having a bastard ; and that the
</p>
<p>crime is the conspiracy, Avhich whether it is to defame or disgrace a
</p>
<p>man, or charge him with heresy, is punishable at common law. So
</p>
<p>in 1663, a conspiracy was held punishable although the court had
</p>
<p>no cognizance of the matter of it, where it might be of loss to the
</p>
<p>prosecutor.'
</p>
<p>Bex V. Armstrong, 1 Yent. 304, was a conspiracy to extort
</p>
<p>money from an individual, by going to him, and affirming that he
</p>
<p>was the father of a bastard child, with a view of inducing him to
</p>
<p>pay them to say no more about it. And it was decided on the
</p>
<p>ground expressly taken by the court, that it was a contrivance by
</p>
<p>conspiracy, to defame the person and cheat him of his money,
</p>
<p>which was an indictable crime of a very heinous nature. In 1705
</p>
<p>in Reg. v. Best, 2 Ld. Eaym. 1167, the principle was laid down
</p>
<p>that the defendants being charged at least with a conspiracy to
</p>
<p>charge the prosecutor with fornication, though that was only a
</p>
<p>spiritual defamation, yet the conspiracy was the gist of the indict-
</p>
<p>ment, and was a temporal offense and punishable as such.
</p>
<p>In 1719 in Bex v. Kinnersley, 1 Strange, 193, the object was
</p>
<p>by a conspiracy to extort money by means of a verbal slan-
</p>
<p>der, not a crime if committed by one only. And in 1730, in

</p>
<p>Bex V. Bryan, 2 Strange, 866, the court in speaking with reference
</p>
<p>to Bex V. Armstrong, in 1678, 1 Yent. 304, says, "there the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was the crime; and an indictment will lie for that, though

</p>
<p>it be to do a lawful act." In that class of conspiracies, the medi-
</p>
<p>tated end was not accomplished in either of the early cases. The
</p>
<p>object in each was to defame, and extort money from an indi-
</p>
<p>vidual ; and the indirect or wrongful means by which that object
</p>
<p>was intended to be effected was verbal slander  not a prosecution,
</p>
<p>but the charge is laid as having been made in pais / in one
</p>
<p>instance the charge being made to the prosecutor himself  a com-
</p>
<p>bination to do that, which if actually done by one alone, would
</p>
<p>not be the subject of an indictment. The conspiracy therefor for
</p>
<p>a corrupt purpose was the offense for which they were punished.
</p>
<p>In Bex V. Bisjyal (1762) 1 W. Bl. 368, Lord Mansfield held a com-
</p>
<p>bination criminal, organized to extort money by charging a man
</p>
<p>" with criminal acts, or such as only may affect his reputation,"
</p>
<p>The crime consisted in the purpose to charge the man publicly, al-
</p>
<p>though not in a court.' A combination to charge privately would
</p>
<p>be a conspiracy to extort or cheat."
</p>
<p>If the purpose be not to extort, the charge must be false or
</p>
<p>without reasonable ground. '
</p>
<p>In 1763, in Rex v. Parsons, 1 "W. Bl. 392, the conspiracy was
</p>
<p>to injure the prosecutor's reputation by pretended revelations of
</p>
<p>a spirit charging him with a murder, and in 1762, in Bex v,
</p>
<p>Bisjjal, 1 W. Bl. 368, Loi^d Mansfield said "the crime laid, is an
</p>
<p>unlawful conspiracy ; this, whether it be to charge a man with
</p>
<p>criminal acts, or such only as may affect his reputation, is fully
</p>
<p>suflficient." In others words, a conspiracy to defraud another by
</p>
<p>verbal scandal, is equally indictable, whether it be to charge the
</p>
<p>party with a crime, or only to injure his standing in society.*
</p>
<p>In Boy V. Skirret, 1 Siderfin, 312, the form of indict-
</p>
<p>ment does not appear, but it was against persons conjointly,
</p>
<p>and therefore either in conspiracy or combination. The charge
</p>
<p>was the false reading of a release to an ignorant man to procure

</p>
<p>ticed by one person, it would not have been an indictable cheat.
</p>
<p>It was the combination which alone made it criminal, and the
</p>
<p>prosecution was sustained although it was not within the Statute
</p>
<p>33 Edward I. In 1705, in Reg. v. MacKarty, 2 Ld. Kaym. 1179,
</p>
<p>6 Mod. 301, 1 Salk. 286, the defendants were conjointly indicted
</p>
<p>for falsely and deceitfully bargaining and exchanging with another
</p>
<p>a quantity of pretended wine for goods, upon the faith of their
</p>
<p>false statement made in pursuance of the combination. The
</p>
<p>crime of conspiracy was not named, but the combination wa&
</p>
<p>charged with the act, and as no false public tokens were used,
</p>
<p>which was necessary at common law to constitute a cheat effected
</p>
<p>by one, and the Statute, 30 Geo. II., chap. 24, against "false pre-
</p>
<p>tences " was not then passed, it was the combination alone on
</p>
<p>which the prosecution could have been sustained. A cheat by
</p>
<p>false public tokens, such as false weights and measures, is indict-
</p>
<p>able, because ordinary care and prudence cannot safeguard one
</p>
<p>against their use, and for the same reason cheats effected by con-
</p>
<p>spiracy are punishable. Indeed, in 1761, Rex v. Wheatly, 2 Burr.
</p>
<p>1127, 1 W. Bl. 273, cheats effected by conspiracy are expressly
</p>
<p>placed upon the same footing with cheats effected by false weight
</p>
<p>and measures.
</p>
<p>In 1704, in Reg. v. Orhell, 6 Mod. 42, the indictment was for
</p>
<p>a conspiracy to cheat one J. S. of his money by inducing him to
</p>
<p>bet upon a foot-race and by bribery controlling the result. The
</p>
<p>act of an individual was not indictable, and the combination con-
</p>
<p>stituted its criminality.
</p>
<p>In Rex V. Edwards, 1 Strange, 707, 8 Mod. 320, 1 Sess. Cas.
</p>
<p>836, the parties were indicted for giving money to a man who
</p>
<p>was settled in the parish of A to induce him to marry a poor and
</p>
<p>helpless woman of the parish of B and make her a charge on his
</p>
<p>own parish. It was objected that it was not unlawful to marry a
</p>
<p>woman and give her a portion, but the object of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>being to impose a pauper on a parish to which she did not belong,

</p>
<p>it was held to be an indictable offense at common law; for that a
</p>
<p>bare conspiracy to do a lawful act to an unlawful end was a crime
</p>
<p>though no act should be done in consequence thereof. The fraud
</p>
<p>was attempted upon the inhabitants of the parish, and as they are
</p>
<p>COMMOi^ LAW ORIGIN OF OFFENSE OF CONSPIRACY. 301
</p>
<p>not the public at large, the offense was directed against individuals,
</p>
<p>though Chitty, in his 3d volume on criminal law, treats it as a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to violate public policy, the principle applies equally to
</p>
<p>both.
</p>
<p>In Fowler's Case, 17S8, 1 East, 4G1, 462, the combination was
</p>
<p>to charge a parish, by bribing a poor man, who had got a poor
</p>
<p>woman of another parish with child, to marry the woman, and
</p>
<p>Buller, Ji, held that " some violence, threats or contrivance," or
</p>
<p>*' some sinister means," must be shown with some forcing of mar-
</p>
<p>riage against the will of the parties. So in Parkhouse's Case,
</p>
<p>1792, 1 East, P. C. 462.
</p>
<p>In Bex v. Seward, 1S34, 1 Ad. & El. 706, it was said if a mar-
</p>
<p>riage was induced by unfair and undue means it might be unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful; the parties being unwilling and the means unlawful.
</p>
<p>In 1719 in Eex v. Cope, 1 Sti-ange, 144, the conspiracy charged
</p>
<p>was to ruin the trade of the prosecutor, who was a card maker, by
</p>
<p>bribing his apprentices to put grease into the paste and destroy
</p>
<p>the appearance of the cards. The act if done by one would not
</p>
<p>have constituted a crime in law, and the conspiracy was the gist of
</p>
<p>the offense, unless, indeed, the act of the apprentice was made a
</p>
<p>crmie in him as an apprentice.*
</p>
<p>In Rex V. Eccles, 1783, 1 Leach, C. C. 274, the indictment
</p>
<p>was for a conspiracy by wrongful and indirect means to impover-
</p>
<p>ish a tailor and to hinder him from following his trade. The
</p>
<p>meditated injury was leveled at a private individual, unconnected
</p>
<p>with any matter of public concernment and not within the prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of any of the enumerated offenses against public trade, which
</p>
<p>are offenses committed by traders or dealers themselves, such as
</p>
<p>cheating, forestalling, regrating, etc.
</p>
<p>Several master tailors were indicted for combining to impoverish
</p>
<p>and prevent a rival master tailor from trading. The proposed means
</p>
<p>not being set out, a question was raised as to the sufficiency of the
</p>
<p>indictment. It was sustained. Lord Mansfield saying: "The
</p>
<p>illegal combination was the git of the offense. Persons in pos-

<p>they individually please, but if they confederate and agree not to

<p>sell them under certain prices it is a conspiracy; so every man

</p>
<p>may work at what price he pleases, but a combination not to work
</p>
<p>under certain prices is a indictable offense."
</p>
<p>It was held that it was not necessary to state the means by
</p>
<p>which the intended mischief was effected, for that the offense did
</p>
<p>not consist in doing the acts by which the end was accomplished
</p>
<p>(for they might be perfectly indifferent) but in conspiring with a
</p>
<p>view to effect the intended mischief by any means; Justice Bul-
</p>
<p>ler saying that "the means were only matter of evidence to prove
</p>
<p>the charge, and not the crime itself."
</p>
<p>The ruling in this case as to the illegal purpose to impoverish
</p>
<p>does not at all conflict with the decision in Le Roy v. Starling^
</p>
<p>1 Sid. 174; Attorney v. Starling, 1 Keb. 650; Hex v. Starling,
</p>
<p>1 Keb. 655, where the information was against the brewers of
</p>
<p>London for conspiring to put down the gallon trade by which the
</p>
<p>poor were supplied, and to cause the poor to mutiny against the
</p>
<p>farmers of excise, and to depauperate the farmers of the excise.
</p>
<p>The only objection taken was that " it is no crime by our law to
</p>
<p>depauperate another in order to enrich oneself, as by undersell-
</p>
<p>ing." It may be no crime to undersell goods to enrich oneself,
</p>
<p>even if it result in pauperizing another, and yet a crime to com-
</p>
<p>bine to undersell for the purpose of impoverishing a rival.
</p>
<p>In Stratton^s Case, 1809, where the indictment was for a com-
</p>
<p>bination for false and malicious prosecution, the indictment alleged
</p>
<p>an intent to deprive the prosecutor of his office.
</p>
<p>In Kenrick^s Case, 1843, Lord Denmaii said that if, in Bex v.
</p>
<p>Turner, 13 East, 228, the meditated injury, instead of ending
</p>
<p>with the trespass in pursuit of hares, had been planned for the
</p>
<p>purpose of seizing the landlord or driving him out of the country,
</p>
<p>it would have been sufficient.
</p>
<p>In Rowland^ Case, 1851, in response to a question whether a
</p>
<p>combination to entice away workmen was indictable. Lord Camp-
</p>
<p>bell said: " "Would it not be indictable if it were done for the
</p>
<p>purpose of ruining a tradesman ? " and Erie, J., said that it was
</p>
<p>lawful for persons to combine for their own benefit, " but I con-

<p>sider the law to be clear so far only as while the purpose of the
</p>
<p>combination is to obtain a benefit for the parties who combine, a
</p>
<p>benefit which by law they can claim. I make that remark,

<p>because a combination for the purpose of injuring another is a

</p>
<p>combination of a different nature, directed personally against the
</p>
<p>party to be injured; and the law allowing them to combine for
</p>
<p>the purpose of obtaining a lawful benefit to themselves, gives no
</p>
<p>sanction to combinations which have for their immediate purpose
</p>
<p>the hurt of another."
</p>
<p>In DujUield's Case, 5 Cox, C. C. 404, 429, Erie, J., said, regard-
</p>
<p>ing Turner* s Case, " A conspiracy to injure a man in his private
</p>
<p>property; a conspiracy to prevent all customers coming to his shop
</p>
<p> what is it but a civil injury ? A conspiracy to injure  two men
</p>
<p>combining to interfere with a man's civil right  is indictable."
</p>
<p>i^or does it matter if the primary purpose of the acts and means
</p>
<p>is not the obstruction and injury of the business of another; yet
</p>
<p>if in the accomplishment of the primary purpose, the intent is to
</p>
<p>make such obstruction or harm an incident of such primary pur-
</p>
<p>pose, if necessary to accomplish it, then the malice follows and is
</p>
<p>established by it.'
</p>
<p>Where the action was for maliciously inducing a singer to break
</p>
<p>her contract, Compton, /., said that where two or more parties
</p>
<p>with a malicious intent to injure a rival trader, go to a banker or
</p>
<p>other party who owes money to his rival, and begs him not to pay
</p>
<p>the money, and by that means ruins or greatly prejudices the
</p>
<p>party, an indictment or writ of conspiracy at common law might
</p>
<p>be maintained, and in a civil action damages beyond the sum with-
</p>
<p>held if the injury were greater."
</p>
<p>In Wentworth's Precedents, vol. 4, p. 105, there is an indict-
</p>
<p>ment, 1788-89, for combination to impoverish R. Meux and to

<p>charges that the defendants, maliciously intending to injure and

<p>drive the said Emma D. Van Horn out of business, and into pub-

<p>lic scandal, shame and disgrace, and to injure her in her credit
</p>
<p>and business, and to prevent her from acquiring any profit or gain

<p>therefrom, or from continuing the same, did maliciously conspire,
</p>
<p>combine and agree to prevent her from enjoying and continuing
</p>
<p>her business, and in pursuance of said conspiracy, etc., did entice
</p>
<p>into their store in ISTewark one of the plaintiff's employes, and by
</p>
<p>artful persuasion and threats induced her to tell where the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff's stock of goods was purchased, telling her the stock would be
</p>
<p>taken from her, and the business closed up; and, in pursuance and
</p>
<p>in further performance of their unlawful intent and combination,
</p>
<p>endeavored to prevent the customers and friends of the plaintiff
</p>
<p>from dealings with her, by falsely and fraudulently representing
</p>
<p>to them that she would not be able to carry on her business, but
</p>
<p>would have to close up, as she was selling goods that did not
</p>
<p>belong to her, and living off the proceeds, instead of accounting
</p>
<p>therefor, and by sending threatening notes and messages to them
</p>
<p>designed to intimidate them from having any dealings with her,
</p>
<p>and did threaten to pursue her until she was ruined. That in
</p>
<p>further pursuance of such combination, and by means of fraud
</p>
<p>and deceit, they did persuade the said firm in ]^ew York to
</p>
<p>decline to complete their contract, and did prevail on them, by
</p>
<p>means of corrupt, fraudulent and deceitful representations and
</p>
<p>statements as to the personal and business character and standing
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff', to remove the stock already supplied her, and
</p>
<p>refuse to deliver her other goods as agreed for, leaving her entirely
</p>
<p>without any stock to sell, or customers to purchase from her, by
</p>
<p>means whereof she was left without stock and credit with the said

</p>
<p>driven out of her business and occupation, and deprived of the
</p>
<p>profit and livelihood which she was making and daily increasing.
</p>
<p>To this declaration a general demurrer was filed, and joi]ider added.
</p>
<p>The declaration is in effect an action on the case setting forth a
</p>
<p>COMMON LAW ORIGIX OF OFFENSE OF CONSPIRACY. 305
</p>
<p>malicious conspiracy, or confederation, with the means employed
</p>
<p>to effect its purjjose, and the resulting damages to the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>It was held that no further specification is required than the
</p>
<p>general terms in which it is pleaded in the declaration.
</p>
<p>Kor is there presented for determination in this pleading the
</p>
<p>vexed question whether an action will lie against a third person
</p>
<p>for the malicious procurement of the breach of a contract, if by
</p>
<p>such procurement damage was intended to result and did result
</p>
<p>to the plaintiff.'
</p>
<p>In the opinion of Mr. Pollock, Torts, 267, the difficulties in
</p>
<p>such cases disappear, or are greatly reduced, when the cause of
</p>
<p>action is considered as belonging to the class in which malice, in
</p>
<p>the sense of actual ill will, is a necessary element. Here the
</p>
<p>whole pleading is based on the malicious conduct of the defend-
</p>
<p>ants in destroying the plaintiff's credit and patronage, and break-
</p>
<p>ing up her business and means of livelihood. Here no breach of
</p>
<p>contract is alleged. There was no binding contract between the
</p>
<p>Xew York firms and the plaintiff upon which they could be sued
</p>
<p>for a breach. Where there is a suable contract between a con-
</p>
<p>tractor and contractee there is difficulty, in principle, in showing
</p>
<p>privity in another, or to make the person who procures a breach
</p>
<p>of the contract the proximate cause of injury. The party who
</p>
<p>breaks the contract, for whatever cause, whether by procurement
</p>
<p>of others or of his own volition, is primarily responsible to the
</p>
<p>other party; and the procurer, it would seem, can only be held
</p>
<p>responsible for the breach, where there is malice shown to the
</p>
<p>sufferer, giving a distinct cause of action for the malice which
</p>
<p>caused the breach of the contract resulting in damages to him.
</p>
<p>The plaintiff Emma D. Van Horn, it is alleged, was selUng goods
</p>
<p>on consignment from others, with the expectation of greater con-
</p>
<p>signments in the future. If the consignors refuse to send the
</p>
<p>goods to her it does not appear that she could have any remedy
</p>
<p>against them. They could send or recall them at pleasure.
</p>
<p>The complaint here is that the goods in the plaintiff's possession
</p>

</p>
<p>were recalled, and her advantageous arrangement for credit with
</p>
<p>the consignors ended, by the fraudulent and malicious act of the
</p>
<p>defendants. If she has no remedy against the defendants, it is

</p>
<p>said, she can liave none against otliers for tlie wrong wliich she
</p>
<p>claims slie lias snffered.
</p>
<p>The dilierence between this action and slander is well stated in
</p>
<p>Hiding v. Smith, L. R. 1 Exch. Div. 91, where a slander against
</p>
<p>the wife was charged as having injured the hnshand's business.
</p>
<p>Pier name was stricken from the record as a joint plaintilf, and
</p>
<p>the action was allowed to proceed by the husband, as a trader car-
</p>
<p>rying on business, founded on an act done by the defendant which
</p>
<p>led to the loss of trade and custom by the plaintiff. It was main-
</p>
<p>tainable on the ground that the injury to the plaintiif's business
</p>
<p>was the natural consequence of the words spoken, wliich would
</p>
<p>prevent persons resorting to the plaintiff's shop. Upon the whole
</p>
<p>case presented in the declaration Mogul Steamship Co. v. Mc
</p>
<p>Gregor, L. R. 21 Q. B. Div. 544, L. R. 23 Q. B. Div. 593, is im-
</p>
<p>portant to aid in preserving the distinction between injuries caused
</p>
<p>by mere rivalries in business, M'ithout the intention of ruining the
</p>
<p>trade of the pluintilf, and those where such intent is shown with
</p>
<p>personal malice towards him. In the first report, Lord Chief'
</p>
<p>Judlci (\)leridge says: "It is too late to dispute, if I desired to
</p>
<p>do so, as I do not, that a wrongful and malicious combination to
</p>
<p>ruin a man in his trade may be ground for such an action as this."'
</p>
<p>In the later report Lord Jastlee Fry, after a full statement of
</p>
<p>cases, says that no mere competition carried on for the purpose
</p>
<p>of gain, and without actual malice, is actionable, even though
</p>
<p>intended to drive the rival in trade aM'ay from his place of busi-
</p>
<p>ness, and though that intention be actually carried into effect.
</p>
<p>L.ord Eslier, M. jR., dissented. It was decided that the exclusion
</p>
<p>of the plaintiffs, rival freighters, from participation in a 5 i)er
</p>
<p>cent rebate on freight on teas from China, not being through
</p>
<p>malice, but in competition to increase their own business, was not
</p>
<p>actionable. The basis of action seems, in Van Horn v. Van
</p>
<p>Horn, 10 L. R. A. 184, 52 N. J. L. 284, it is said by the court, to

<p>In Rex V. Leiyh, 1775, 2 JVIacldin's Life, 217, in Macl-Jins'
</p>
<p>Case, 1 Car. ^ K. 28, note.ic 2Campb. 372,?<6>^d, (I Went. Tl. 443,
</p>
<p>it was held, that an indictment would lie for a conspiracy to
</p>
<p>imjxiverish an actor, by driving or hissing him oif the stage. And
</p>
<p>in Clijt'ord v. Brandon, 1809, 2 Campb. 358, it was said by Sir
</p>
<p>James Mansfield, that "though the audience had a right to express
</p>
<p>by applause or hisses their sensations at the moment, yet if a body
</p>
<p>of men were to go to the theatre with a settled intention of hissing
</p>
<p>an actor, or even of damning a piece, there can be no doubt that
</p>
<p>such a deliberate preconcerted scheme would amount to a con-

<p>In Ilex V. Bohinson, 1 Leach, C. C. 37, it was distinctly admit-

<p>ted that a cons}uracy to do an injury to the person or estate of

<p>another was an indictabk; offense, and that it was not required to

<p>prove any direct or immediate injury, or even to show any specific

<p>to coUcct from all the circumstances of the case, whether there

<p>was not an intention or design in the parties in contracting a mar-
</p>
<p>riage in the assumed name of Richard Holland to raise a spurious

<p>thought a combination to set np a siipposititions child as a legiti-
</p>
<p>mate one, so as to impede the course of descent in hiw, and defeat
</p>
<p>the heir at law, might be indictable.
</p>
<p>In Rex V. Lara, 6 T. R. 565, it was adinitted bj counsel in
</p>
<p>argument that a fraud upon an individual by conspiracy was
</p>
<p>indictable, and the doctrine laid down by the judges in Rex v.
</p>
<p>Wheatly, 2 Burr. 1127, 1 W. Bl. 273, was fully recognized and
</p>
<p>adopted by Lord Kenyon; that is, that a cheat effected by a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is an indictable offense.
</p>
<p>In Rex V. De Bersnger, 3 Maule & S. 68, the indictment was
</p>
<p>for a conspiracy by false rumors to raise the price of the public
</p>
<p>government funds, with intent to injure such of the king's subjects
</p>
<p>a,s should purchase on a particular day. It was contended that
</p>
<p>this charge was too general as to the persons intended to be
</p>
<p>harmed, but the objection was overruled, not on the ground that
</p>
<p>to constitute an indictable conspiracy, it should be leveled either
</p>
<p>at the public aggregated, or at a class or distinct portion, as dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished from an individual, and that the case fell within one
</p>
<p>of these classes of conspiracies; for it was treated throughout as
</p>
<p>perfectly clear, that if it had been laid with intent to prejudice or
</p>
<p>defraud either the public or an individual or individuals by name
</p>
<p>it would have been good, and the only difficulty on that part of
</p>
<p>the case was, whether, being laid with intent to injure those who
</p>
<p>might become purchasers, and not either an individual by name
</p>
<p>or the public in its aggregate capacity, the generality of the charge
</p>
<p>did not vitiate the indictment. But the indictment was sustained
</p>
<p>ex necessitate rei, on the ground that as it was impossible the
</p>
<p>defendants could have known who would be the purchasers on
</p>
<p>that day, the charge could not have been more specific. And
</p>
<p>though it was conceded that to raise or lower the price of the
</p>
<p>public funds, was not per se a crime, yet it was held to be an
</p>
<p>offense for a number of persons to conspire to raise them by false
</p>
<p>rumors; and that the crime was not in raising the funds, but in
</p>
<p>the act of conspiracy and combination to do so, and would be

</p>
<p>A contract entered into by the grain dealers of a particular
</p>
<p>locality, the real purpose of which is to establish in acti^^e force a
</p>
<p>secret combination which would stifle all competition, control the
</p>
<p>price of grain, cost of storage and of shipment, is in restraint of
</p>
<p>trade and void as against public policy.'
</p>
<p>Where one producer or holder of an article of public use enters
</p>
<p>into a contract with another producer or holder, binding the latter
</p>
<p>to hold and keep out of the market his supply, the contract is
</p>
<p>against public policy and void.'^
</p>
<p>An agreement to form a pool for the purchase of a commodity
</p>
<p>in common use, involving the controlling and withdrawal from
</p>
<p>the market of large quantities, is an unlawful combination which
</p>
<p>would not be enforced between the parties. '
</p>
<p>Upon the same principle in Clary r. Coin. 4 Pa. 21(), an indict-
</p>
<p>ment which charged a conspiracy which had for its purpose the
</p>
<p>circulation of certain false and forged bills, with the intent to
</p>
<p>cheat and defraud "the citizens of this commonwealth and oth-
</p>
<p>ers," was held good. So also in Co)n. v. Judd, 2 Mass. 329, a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to manufacture sjDurious indigo, and sell the same at
</p>
<p>public auction with intent to cheat and defraud such persons as
</p>
<p>should become purchasers, was held sufficient. *
</p>
<p>The conviction in Be^v v. Gill, 2 Barn. & Aid. 204, was for a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to cheat several individuals by name. The indictment
</p>
<p>was not under Statute 30 George II., for the particular false pre-
</p>
<p>tences were not stated showing them to be within the statute, as
</p>
<p>required,' or under Statute 33 Henry YIII., against cheating by
</p>
<p>false privy tokens, etc."
</p>
<p>It was ruled that when several persons have once agreed to
</p>
<p>cheat a particular individual of his money, although they may not

<p>at the time have fixed upon any particular means for that purpose,

<p>COMMON LAW ORIGIN OF OFFENSE OF CONSPIRACY. 311
</p>
<p>the offense of conspiracy is complete, and that it was sufficient to
</p>
<p>tate the act of conspiring and tlie object of the conspiracy in the
</p>
<p>indictment, without setting out the means by which it was in-
</p>
<p>tended to be accomphshed; wliich, as Lord Mansfield said, in Rex
</p>
<p>V. Eccles, 1 Leach, C. C. 274, "may be perfectly indifferent."
</p>
<p>The indictment was not sustained on the ground that it was a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to commit an indictable offense; for if it had not been
</p>
<p>for a conspiracy to cheat, but against an individual for the actual
</p>
<p>commission of the offense it would have been bad for the gener-
</p>
<p>ality of the allegation. Rex v. Mawlry, 6 T. K.. 619, for a
</p>
<p>conspiracy to prevent the course of justice, shows that all indict-
</p>
<p>able offenses are not embraced by the Statute 33 Edward I., but
</p>
<p>that at common law a conspiracy to do anything which the law-
</p>
<p>forbids is indictable.
</p>
<p>In Rex V. Delaval^ 3 Burr. 1434, the conspiracy was to place a
</p>
<p>girl by her own consent, in the hands of Delaval, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of prostitution. The act of seduction was not in itself an indict-
</p>
<p>able offense, but it was the end, the immoral purpose of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy which gave it a criminal character. The law holds as
</p>
<p>criminal all conspiracies against public virtue and good morals,
</p>
<p>although the act by an individual would not be thus punishable.
</p>
<p>The influence of many, united to overcome the virtue of a woman,
</p>
<p>is recognized as more dangerous than the seductive arts of one.
</p>
<p>So a conspiracy to induce a young female, by false pretenses, to
</p>
<p>have illicit connection with a man.'
</p>
<p>And in a recent case in Illinois, although seduction was not
</p>
<p>made criminal by statute, the conspiracy to accomplish it was held
</p>
<p>to be so at common law, and it was held unnecessary to show that
</p>
<p>the means used were either unlawful or criminal,^
</p>
<p>So a conspiracy to induce a girl of 17, not shown to be chaste,
</p>
<p>to become a common prostitute, was held indictable. Reg. v. How-
</p>
<p>ell, 1864, 4 Fost. & F. 160, Bramwell, B., ruling that any unlaw-
</p>
<p>fulness in the state of things to be accomplished by the conspir-
</p>
<p>acy was sufficient to give it a criminal character, and since agree-

<p>ments for prostitution or claims for goods supplied for purposes
</p>
<p>of prostitution are illegal in the sense that they cannot be enforced,

</p>
<p>prostitution itself is a sufficiently ine2:al state of things to render
</p>
<p>indictable a combination to bring it about.
</p>
<p>So a conspiracy to accomplish the abduction of a minor and to
</p>
<p>procure adultery, was indictable.'
</p>
<p>So for the procurement of a fraudulent marriage ceremony. *
</p>
<p>Or to aid female infant to escape parental control to marry her. '
</p>
<p>So it is criminal to conspire to do any act offensive to public
</p>
<p>decency, as preventing burial of body of pauper and removing it
</p>
<p>from workhouse for any improper or indecent purpose."
</p>
<p>In 1 Hawk, P. C. 190, chap. 72, it is said, "there can be no doubt
</p>
<p>that all combinations whatsoever, wrongfully to prejudice a third
</p>
<p>person are highly criminal at common law."*
</p>
<p>Chitty says: "In a word, all confederacies wrongfully to prej-
</p>
<p>udice another are misdemeanors at common law, whether the in-
</p>
<p>tention is to injure his person, his property, or his character." *
</p>
<p>And 4 Bl. Com. 157 (Christian's ed., note 4) "every confederacy
</p>
<p>to injure individuals, or to do acts which are unlawful, or prejudi-
</p>
<p>cial to the community, is a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>In 1 Tremain's P. C. 82, 83, there is a precedent of informa-
</p>
<p>tion against Turner and others, for a conspiracy to destroy the
</p>
<p>reputation of one George Green, and falsely to charge him with
</p>
<p>adultery with the wife of one of the conspirators, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of extorting money from him. In 1 Treniaine P. C. 86, against
</p>
<p>Hecord and others for a cheat practiced on Lady Dorothea Sey-
</p>
<p>mour in prevailing on her by means of a falsehood to advance
</p>
<p>large sums of money to them. In the same book, p. 91, against
</p>
<p>Wilcox and others for cheating by conspiracy one John Dulton
</p>
<p>of a quantity of cloth, under pretense of buying them. In page
</p>
<p>91 against Taydler and others for a cheat by conspiracy in draw-
</p>
<p>ing an absolute conveyance to themselves of the estates of two
</p>
<p>women, and persuading him to execute it, pretending it was only
</p>
<p>in trust for the women. In Tremaine, P. C. 97, against Alibone

<p>and an indigent woman, wliom they represented as being rich.
</p>
<p>In neither of tliese could an indictment have been sustained for
</p>
<p>the same injury practiced by an individual, without the charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy or combination, and as Tremaine gives the term, the
</p>
<p>reigns and the names of the respective parties, there can be lit-
</p>
<p>tle doubt that they are precedents of informations in adjudicated
</p>
<p>cases, and that they were held to be good, and they go far to
</p>
<p>show how the common law was understood in England in the
</p>
<p>reigns of Charles and James II. And the law of conspiracy as
</p>
<p>settled by the uniform tenor of the decisions of the courts in
</p>
<p>England has, except as to combinations of workmen, been recog-
</p>
<p>nized and adopted as the common law generally in this country.
</p>
<p>Under that law any combination to prejudice another unlaw-
</p>
<p>fully has been considered as constituting the offense of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>It is enough if the acts agreed to be done, although not criminal,
</p>
<p>are wu'ongful ; that is, amount to a civil wrong.' The offense has
</p>
<p>been held to consist in the conspiracy, and not in the acts com-
</p>
<p>mitted for carrying it into effect; and the cliarge has been held

<p>sufficient when made in general terms describing an unlawful

<p>evil results, that to prevent such combinations, the law holds
</p>
<p>those uniting guilty of criminal conspiracy, although the doing
</p>
<p>of any of the acts by an individual would not be puiiished as a
</p>
<p>crime. The influence of an act upon society determines whether
</p>
<p>it is criminal conspiracy to combine to accomplish it, and not
</p>
<p>whether the act itself is criminally punishable.
</p>
<p>I believe every well considered case which attempts a general
</p>
<p>definition, will support this statement. Of course, when the ques-
</p>
<p>tion is as to what particular acts possess these attributes, some
</p>
<p>difi^erence will be found among the authorities, for it may depend
</p>
<p>upon the local law to deterjnine whether the purpose to be accom-

<p>31G CONSPIKACY AT COMMON LAAV.
</p>
<p>duct bj trades, employers or workmen regarding the price of
</p>
<p>goods or labor/
</p>
<p>The English Criminal Law Commissioners stated this general
</p>
<p>principle as the foundation of the law of conspiracy, that the con-
</p>
<p>federacy of several persons to effect any injurious object creates
</p>
<p>such a new and additional power to cause injury as requires crim-
</p>
<p>inal restraint; althouHi none would be necessary were the same
</p>
<p>thing proposed or even attempted to be done by any person
</p>
<p>singly.*
</p>
<p>Many acts are said to be unlawful which would not be the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of criminal conspiracy. Other acts are unlawful because
</p>
<p>they are in violation of the criminal law or some penal statute.
</p>
<p>If the ends or the means are criminal in themselves or contrary to
</p>
<p>some penal statute, the conspiracy is clearly an offense.^
</p>
<p>A conspiracy to commit a felony or misdemeanor or any crim-
</p>
<p>inal act is indictable." So it is indictable to conspire to charge
</p>
<p>one with a crime, although there be no intent to procure a prose-
</p>
<p>cution.^ It is also indictable to form a conspiracy to cheat one by
</p>
<p>making one drunk and playing falsely at cards with him. 
</p>
<p>As a general rule at common law all confederacies wrongfully
</p>
<p>to prejudice another are misdemeanors and indictable, whether
</p>
<p>the intention is to injure his property, liis person, or his character.
</p>
<p>It is the intent to cause injury that poisons the agreement.*
</p>
<p>All of the parties to the conspiracy need not be able each to aid

<p>'Or to accomplish it. It is sufficient if one can do the act proposed
</p>
<p>to render all consenting and combinino; (ruilty.'
</p>
<p>A conspiracy to injure a man in his trade or profession is
</p>
<p>indictable. " All conspiracies to ''excite disalfection" are indicta-
</p>
<p>ble at common law. ' A conspiracy to stir up jealousies, hatre<l
</p>
<p>and ill will between different classes of citizens is unlawful;^ or to
</p>
<p>induce others to violate the laws. '
</p>
<p>It is said that there are many cases in which the act itself would
</p>
<p>not be cognizal)le by law, if done by a single person, which
</p>
<p>becomes the subject of indictment when effected by several by a
</p>
<p>joint design. * Thus each person at a public exhibition has a
</p>
<p>right to express his disapprobation of the performance, but if sev-
</p>
<p>eral previously agree to express condemnation they may be guilty
</p>
<p>of conspiracy. ^
</p>
<p>So it has been said, there are other cases in which, though the
</p>
<p>act may be morally criminal, it is not illegal except on the ground
</p>
<p>of conspiracy; the verbal slander of a private individual is not
</p>
<p>indictable at common law, but it is so where several unite in a
</p>
<p>scheme to blast his character. *
</p>
<p>But where the act is lawful for an individual, it can be the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of a conspiracy, when done in concert, only where there is a
</p>
<p>direct intention that injury shall result from it; thus if a number
</p>
<p>of persons should combine to establish a ferry, not from motives
</p>
<p>of public or private utility, but to ruin or injure the owner of a
</p>
<p>neighboring ferry, the wickedness of the motive would render the
</p>
<p>association criminal, although it would be otherwise if the com-

<p>bination were to employ capital in fair business competition with
</p>
<p>others in the same calling for .profit and not for oppression. So
</p>
<p>the combination is criminal where the object is to benefit the con-
</p>
<p>spirators to the prejudice of the public or the oppression of indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, and where such prejudice or oppression is the natural and
</p>
<p>necessary consequence. Thus if the bakers of a town were to
</p>
<p>combine to hold up the article of bread; or a powerful corpora-
</p>
<p>tion to control the article of sugar; or a necessary article in com-
</p>
<p>mon use like matches, and by means of a scarcity thus produced
</p>
<p>extort an exorbitant price for it, altliough the injury to the public
</p>
<p>would be only collateral to the object of the association, it would
</p>
<p>be indictable. *
</p>
<p>So there must be an agreement of two or more persons to do the
</p>
<p>act, not a mere intention. ' But consent will amount to such
</p>
<p>agreement. ^
</p>
<p>Conspiracies to accomplish purposes wliich may or may not be
</p>
<p>by law punishable as crimes, but which are unlawful as violations
</p>
<p>of the rights of individuals, and for which the cival law will afford

<p>the same process punish the ofliender for the wrong and outrage

</p>
<p>A pubHc meeting called to denounce the acts of the police while
</p>
<p>in the due performance of their duty and tending to excite armed

<p>spiracy and should be suppressed by legal authority. "
</p>
<p>An understanding among officers charged with the execution
</p>
<p>of a statute that they will violate it or permit its \T.olatiou is a
</p>
<p>conspiracy. '
</p>
<p>But the intent to violate law must appear. 
</p>
<p>So a conspiracy to induce public officers to violate the law or
</p>
<p>do acts not authorized is unlawful.* Or to commit fraud at a
</p>
<p>legal election. * Or to procure the appointment of an election
</p>
<p>officer.' Or in an appointment to an office.^ So the sale by com-
</p>
<p>bination of unhealthy food is unlawful.*
</p>
<p>So it will be also if private parties conspire to induce the viola-

<p> TO. Combinations to Cheat.  An indictment for a conspira-
</p>
<p>cy will not in general lie in those cases of fraud or tresjjass not
</p>
<p>affecting the person, for which an action or suit at law will afford
</p>
<p>adequate relief, if the intention of the conspirators was consum-
</p>
<p>mated, when the means intended to be resorted to are private. '
</p>
<p>In 2 East's C. L. title Cheats, cheats by conspiracy are treated
</p>
<p>of as being on the same footing with cheats affected by the use of
</p>
<p>false public tokens, as false weights and measures. Chitty in
</p>
<p>his 3d vol. title Conspiracy, after speaking of indictable con-
</p>
<p>spiracies leveled at individuals, says, "but the object of conspiracy
</p>
<p>is not conhned to an immediate wrong to particular individuals.
</p>
<p>It may be to injure public trade, to affect public health, to violate
</p>
<p>public policy, to obstruct public justice, or to do any act in itself
</p>
<p>illegal." Thus he takes a clear distinction between Indictable
</p>
<p>combinations to injure individuals, and such as have for their
</p>
<p>object an injury to the public at large, or the commission of acts
</p>
<p>which are in themselves illegal, and on page 1140 he says "that
</p>
<p>to constitute a conspiracy, it is not necessary that the act itself
</p>
<p>should be itself illegal, or even immoral; that it should affect the
</p>
<p>public at large; or that it should be accomplished by false pre-
</p>
<p>tences."
</p>
<p>If the purpose of a conspiracy is to injure or defraud the pub-
</p>
<p>lic, then the latter has a direct interest either residing in the com-
</p>
<p>munity at large or in the State as a corporate body. If tlie object
</p>
<p>be to injure an individual, then the public has only an indirect
</p>
<p>interest as concerned in the maintenance of order, the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of justice and the like. A conspiracy to injure the public is
</p>
<p>indictable, independent of the means employed. A conspiracy
</p>
<p>to injure a private individual only becomes subject to indictments
</p>
<p>through the intervention of statutes and rules of law defining
</p>
<p>what private injuries are regarded as detrimental to the public*

</p>
<p>benefit of the public is a conspiracy affecting the public and
</p>
<p>indictable/ or to defraud the state itself. *
</p>
<p>A conspiracy to secure certain persons to be made directors of
</p>
<p>a corporation by unlawful means, in order to procure appointments
</p>
<p>to positions for the conspirators, is an indictable offense.^
</p>
<p>A false token and counterfeit letter are things that may affect
</p>
<p>others than the intended objects of the cheat. They may to some
</p>
<p>extent maintain a credit with the public, and so be a public injury
</p>
<p>like spurious goods offered as genuine to the public," the mak-
</p>
<p>ing of which with such intent is indictable even if no sale be
</p>
<p>effected.' So the making of illegal or spurious notes is indictable
</p>
<p>as liable to deceive the public;  or cheating with bank notes or
</p>
<p>illegal or void bonds.' But the means need not be resolved upon
</p>
<p>if the purpose to cheat is fixed,' and it may be accomplished by
</p>
<p>conduct alone, with neither token nor words used. ' The mere
</p>
<p>agreement is the offense, the conspiracy constituting the crime,
</p>
<p>and it is equally one whether the purpose be to cheat an individual
</p>
<p>or a corporation; a class or community or company; a bank of
</p>
<p>circulation or deposit, whose loss will involve the pubHc or the
</p>
<p>private creditors of the conspirators or any of them; so a conspir-
</p>
<p>acy to obtain credit, or goods by pretense of solvency, or without
</p>
<p>the purpose of paying for them. The actual success of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy is simply an aggravation of the crime."

<p>in name of a non-existing firm. '
</p>
<p>The use of false pubhc tokens  false weights and measures 
</p>
<p>evinces a fixed purpose to defraud the entire community. It is
</p>
<p>not the yielding to sudden temptation that may perhaps be ex-
</p>
<p>hibited in case of a private cheat, and not therefore indictable,
</p>
<p>but it proves a deliberate purpose to use the means selected by
</p>
<p>the law to secure accuracy and fair dealing, to deceive the public.
</p>
<p>Of course such a cheat, clothing itself in the garb of legal honesty,
</p>
<p>will deceive where a private cheat would fail, and naturally such
</p>
<p>a use of public tokens is punished criminaliter, both to protect
</p>
<p>the public and to punish abuse of the means the law has selected
</p>
<p>to shield the public from fraud. All conspiracies to cheat by
</p>
<p>such means, as well as to cheat by means which, if employed by
</p>
<p>an individual would render him criminally liable, are therefore
</p>
<p>indictable. * Fraudulently filling up stolen railroad tickets in
</p>
<p>pursuance of a conspiracy to pass them is indictable ; ^ so falsely
</p>
<p>representing the condition of a corporation, ^ or of public stocks.
</p>
<p>It is the deliberate determined purpose to defraud and the unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful and dangerous means employed in the use of public tokens,
</p>
<p>without acting in concert, that demand interposition of the crim-
</p>
<p>inal law, and for the same reasons, false, fraudulent, or malicious
</p>
<p>conspiracies, to cheat or otherwise injure a third person, are indict-
</p>
<p>able offenses, because ordinary care cannot as effectually protect

<p>the individual from the machinations of a band of conspirators, as
</p>
<p>against a single cheat. Fraud, falsehood and malice are, at war
</p>
<p>with social order and commercial prosperity, and whenever they
</p>
<p>assume a form against which ordinary care and prudence will not

<p>serve as a protection, the law will treat that form as a criminal
</p>
<p>weapon, and punish those using it. It will punish a false pre-
</p>
<p>tense in a conspiracy which would not sustain a prosecution for
</p>
<p>the statutory crime of obtaining under false pretenses, and where
</p>
<p>the wrong inflicted is simply an equitable one, ' but still there
</p>
<p>must be more than a false promise, or extravagance in valuation,
</p>
<p>and the wrong inflicted or contemplated must be to the ownership
</p>
<p>and not to temporary possession of the property only.
</p>
<p>But a false representation of quality or soundness, or the fact
</p>
<p>of purchase or sale is suflicient. '
</p>
<p>It was a long and difficult task to separate the idea of a criminal
</p>
<p>conspiracy at common law, where the agreement or conspiracy
</p>
<p>was the gravamen of the offense, from the real complaint in a
</p>
<p>civil action, that the combination of two or more persons has
</p>
<p>enabled them to inflict a great wrong on the plaintiff. The com-
</p>
<p>bination or conspiracy in the latter case is therefore a matter of
</p>
<p>aggravation or inducement only, of which one or all might be
</p>
<p>found guilty; while in the former, it was essential to show that
</p>
<p>two or more had joined in an agreement to do an unlawful act,
</p>
<p>or to do a lawful act in an unlawful manner. The distinction is
</p>
<p>now well established that in civil actions the conspiracy is not the
</p>
<p>gravamen of the charge, but may be both pleaded and proved as
</p>
<p>aggravating the wrong of which the plaintiff complains, and
</p>
<p>enabling him to recover against all as joint tort-feasors. If he
</p>
<p>fails in the proof of a conspiracy or concerted design, he may still
</p>
<p>recover damages against such as are shown to be guilty of the tort
</p>
<p>without such agreement.*

<p>328 CONSPIKACY AT COMMON LAW.
</p>
<p>it is the isolated act of an individual and does not so injuriously
</p>
<p>affect society as to requii*e the intervention of the law, but when
</p>
<p>acts innocent in themselves, but to accomplish a cheat, are com-
</p>
<p>mitted by numbers in furtherance of a common object, and with
</p>
<p>the advantages and strength which concentrated determination
</p>
<p>impart to them, they assume the grave importance of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>and the peace and order of society require their repression. '
</p>
<p>All combinations in society to effect an evil purpose are danger-
</p>
<p>ous, and when their object and purpose is to cheat by whatever
</p>
<p>means, an individual, they are obnoxious to the law. *
</p>
<p>In The Poulterers 6<25e(1611), it was determined that the agree-
</p>
<p>ment for a combination, where the criminal intent is manifested
</p>
<p>by the agreement, is indictable, and as the essence of conspiracy
</p>
<p>is in the intent, the requirement in the case of statutory deceit,
</p>
<p>that the proposed pretense should be reasonably calculated to
</p>
<p>accomplish the object, would not necessarily apply to an agree-
</p>
<p>ment for a combination. J^or would it, when the evil intent is
</p>
<p>proved, be required that the means contemplated should be
</p>
<p>reasonably sufficient to accomplish the general purpose, as is neces.
</p>
<p>sary in case of an attempt to commit some other crimes. This
</p>
<p>view finds support in the ancient cases for conspiracy to commit
</p>
<p>treason, and clearly special circumstances, preventing the use of
</p>
<p>the means in a special case, which might defeat a prosecution for
</p>
<p>an attempt, would not defeat such prosecution for a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>But it is supposed a court would find it difficult to satisfy itself of
</p>
<p>the intent, where the means contemplated were plainly not in any
</p>
<p>event adapted to accomplish the purpose.
</p>
<p>It is sufficient to constitute a conspiracy if two or more persons
</p>
<p>combine by fraud and false pretenses and subtle means to defraud,
</p>
<p>cheat, or injure another.^ Conspiracies to defraud by obtaining
</p>
<p>money or goods by false pretenses are indictable.*

<p>So cheating by means of conspiracy in sham bidding at auction
</p>
<p>is criminal;' or attempting by conspiracy to obtain funds in a false
</p>
<p>name;" or to obtain real estate.'
</p>
<p>There are in cases of an early date, followed by later ones,
</p>
<p>either decisions or dicta, English and American, declaring that a
</p>
<p>combination for the commission of acts unlawful in a moral sense,
</p>
<p>or by means morally wrong, is indictable. *
</p>
<p>This view has been supposed to be questioned by some modern
</p>
<p>cases, and they are construed as holding that, to constitute a crim-
</p>
<p>inal conspiracy, there must have been an unlawful or criminal
</p>
<p>purj)ose, or the use of unlawful or criminal means  a combination
</p>
<p>to promote an end in some degree criminal, or to effect an end by
</p>
<p>means having some degree of criminality.* But it has been held
</p>
<p>an offense at common law for a prisoner to escape from jail; and
</p>
<p>for one to solicit another to commit adultery. Neither of these
</p>
<p>acts are forbidden by statute, yet it was held in each case, after

</p>
<p>There is no difference between a conspiracy to commit an act
</p>
<p>which is unlawful at common law and one to commit an act
</p>
<p>declared to be unlawful by statute; and hence a conspiracy to
</p>

</p>
<p>An indictment will lie for a bare conspiracy to cheat or defraud
</p>
<p>a third person though the means of effecting it should not be deter-
</p>
<p>mined at the time. '
</p>
<p>The United States has declared it a criminal offense to use the

<p>mails for the purpose of defrauding. The offense consists: 1st.
</p>
<p>In devising or intending to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud.
</p>
<p>2d. In opening or intending to open correspondence or commu-
</p>
<p>nication with some other person, or inciting such person to open

<p>CONSPIRACY TO SLANDER. 333
</p>
<p>Tniich as cheats and libels." That is the only reason assigned in
</p>
<p>the books why libels are punishable by indictment ; and whether
</p>
<p>they have in fact a more direct tendency to a breach of the peace
</p>
<p>than verbal slanders, which are not j;f / se so punishable, it is now
</p>
<p>too late to inquire as it is thus settled. Undoubtedly a written
</p>
<p>libel displays more settled malignity of spirit, and intends and
</p>
<p>inflicts more lasting and irritating wounds than a verbal slander,
</p>
<p>which perhaps in utterance exhaled all the heat which engendered
</p>
<p>it. The written libel therefore is the most dangerous to the pub-
</p>
<p>lic peace and good order.
</p>
<p>But the law recognizes that a conspiracy to utter a verbal
</p>
<p>filander involves the same deliberation and malice as a written
</p>
<p>libel, and the union of numbers in such a purpose is as dangerous
</p>
<p>as in other combinations for evil.' An indictment may therefore
</p>
<p>be sustained for a conspiracy to slander a person to extort money
</p>
<p>from another or to injure his reputation by means not indict-
</p>
<p>able if practiced by an individual, as by verbal defamation, and
</p>
<p>that whether it charge him with an indictable offense or not, or
</p>
<p>whether intended to institute a prosecution.^
</p>
<p>In a recent case decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
</p>
<p>at Pittsburg, on appeal, the Cigarmakers' International Union
</p>
<p>Kg. 126 of Ephrata, Lancaster County, by bill in equity had
</p>
<p>restrained cigar manufacturer John H. Brendle, from using the
</p>
<p>'Cigarmakers' International Union label on his goods. The county
</p>
<p>court sustained the master's report in behalf of this injunction.
</p>
<p>Brendle is a union manufacturer who had incurred the ill will of
</p>
<p>local oflicials and refused to use their labels. He issued similar
</p>
<p>labels or trade marks of his own, and appealed to the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court from the injunction.

<p>334 CONSPIEACi' AT COMMON LAW  CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>The court in refusing to continue the injunction, reverses the
</p>
<p>lower court's decision on the ground that the cigarmakers' union,
</p>
<p>formed for the " mental, moral, and physical welfare of its mem-
</p>
<p>bers," is a personal and social organization, not a commercial one,
</p>
<p>and under the law of Congress, therefore, cannot own a trade-
</p>
<p>mark. An especially interesting feature of the decision is its dis-
</p>
<p>cussion of the social claim, set forth in terms upon the union
</p>
<p>cigar label, to the exclusive right not only to the use thereof, but
</p>
<p>stigmatizing all workmen not permitted to use the trade-mark as
</p>
<p>inferior men. The label describes the cigars it accompanies as
</p>
<p>being made by first-class workmen, and adds that all cigars not
</p>
<p>having the label are of " inferior, rat shop, cooley, prison, or filthy
</p>
<p>tenement house workmanship," and has a note therefore " recom-
</p>
<p>mending these union cigars to all smokers throughout the world."
</p>
<p>The opinion says : " This is an attempt to use the public as a
</p>
<p>means of coercion in order to find a market for their goods or
</p>
<p>labor. A first-class workman is one who does first-class work,
</p>
<p>whether his name is on the rolls of any given society or not.
</p>
<p>Filthiness and criminality of character depend on conduct, not on
</p>
<p>membership of the union. Legitimate competition rests on
</p>
<p>superiority of workmanship and business methods, not on the use
</p>
<p>of vulgar epithets and personal denunciations.
</p>
<p>" The International Union in this case has an avowed purpose
</p>
<p>to do harm to non-union men, to prevent the sale of their work,
</p>
<p>to cover them with opprobrium, and they ask a court of equity to
</p>
<p>say they have a right to do so. We decline to say so."

<p> 73. Conspiracies Relating to Trade and Labor.  The
</p>
<p>recognized rule' that contracts in restraint of trade, and depriving 
</p>
<p>the pubhc of the avails of labor, are illegal, carries with it the
</p>
<p>result, that all combinations and conspiracies to accomplish the
</p>
<p>same results are criminal, as they are aimed at an illegal object. ^

<p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF CONSPIRACY. 335
</p>
<p>A conspiracy is indictable to deter a man from retaining and
</p>
<p>employing an attorney to prosecute or defend his cause, under
</p>
<p>penalty of being published as a "scab," and having his name held
</p>
<p>up to public ridicule and contempt, because the attorney did not
</p>
<p>belong to a particular bar association; or to deter employers in
</p>
<p>their selection and employment of particular workmen by vio-
</p>
<p>lence, threats, coercion or intimidation; or for journeymen to com-
</p>
<p>bine to prevent the employment of apprentices through intimi-
</p>
<p>dating their employers is indictable.*
</p>
<p> 74. Development of the Doctrine of Conspiracy in Trade
</p>
<p>Combinations.  In England the matter is now regulated largely
</p>
<p>by statute. In this country, in 1806, there was a trial of certain
</p>
<p>boot and shoe makers of Philadelphia, before the mayor of that
</p>
<p>city, for conspiring to increase the rates of wages, and to prevent
</p>
<p>others from working at less wages, but no general principle was
</p>
<p>distinctly asserted, unless it was, that what each individual might
</p>
<p>lawfully do became criminal when each became "bound down by
</p>
<p>their agreements, and pledged by mutual engagements, to persist
</p>
<p>in it, however contrary to their own judgment." And it was
</p>
<p>said "the continuance in improper conduct may therefore well
</p>
<p>be attributed to the combination." In 1809, in the Journeymen
</p>
<p>Cordwainers of New York, the mayor expressly omitted to decide
</p>
<p>whether an agreement not to work except for certain wages would
</p>
<p>be indictable j?^/' seJ*
</p>
<p>In a habeas corpus case, Com. v. Carlisle, Brightly (Pa.) 36, in
</p>
<p>1821, before Judge Gibson of the Supreme Court, he held that
</p>
<p>while the mere act of combining to change the price of labor is, per-
</p>
<p>haps, evidence of impropriety of intention, it is not conclusive, for
</p>
<p>if the accused can show that the object was not to undervalue labor
</p>
<p>but to foil their antagonists in an attempt to assign to it, by sur-
</p>
<p>reptitious means, a value which it would not otherwise have, they
</p>
<p>will make out a good defense. Accordingly a combination of
</p>
<p>employers to depress the wages of journeymen below what they
</p>
<p>should be, if there was no recurrence to artificial means by either

<p>side, is criminal. The motive may be as important to induce as
</p>
<p>to avoid an inference of criminality. After the Court for the
</p>
<p>Correction of Errors, of New York, had reversed, by the casting
</p>
<p>vote of the President, the judgment of the Supreme Court in
</p>
<p>Lambert v. People, 7 Cow. 166, 9 Cow. 578, declaring by such
</p>
<p>reversal that in a conspiracy to commit a criminal act, the means
</p>
<p>need not be stated, but if the act is not illegal in itself, the means
</p>
<p>must appear to be so, and leaving doubtful the law as to what
</p>
<p>constituted a conspiracy to inflict mere private injury, not affect-
</p>
<p>ing the public, the Legislature having defined criminal conspir-
</p>
<p>acy, and among other things declared it covered a combination to
</p>
<p>commit an act injurious to trade or commerce, it was held in Peo-
</p>
<p>ple V. Fisher, 14 Wend. 9, that a body of journeymen shoemak-
</p>
<p>ers violated the statute by combining for the purpose of prevent-
</p>
<p>ing any other workmen, whether belonging to their organization
</p>
<p>or not, from working below prices fixed by them. Here the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy reached others outside the society and indeed it prevented
</p>
<p>the master, under penalty of being deserted by the associated
</p>
<p>workmen, from employing anyone at less wages, and it excluded
</p>
<p>other workmen from accepting work at less prices,
</p>
<p>A combination producing such a result was thus characterized
</p>
<p>in Com. v. Carlisle, Brightly (Pa.) 36. Whenever the act, agreed
</p>
<p>among several to be done, must necessarily injure the pubhc or
</p>
<p>oppress individuals, by enabling those confederating to exercise an
</p>
<p>unlawful power, such action taking effect either in extortion or
</p>
<p>mischief upon such individuals or the public, constitutes a con-
</p>
<p>sj)iracy.'
</p>
<p>It is the duty of the state to protect the individual citizen
</p>
<p>against the combined power of numbers to injure him in his legit-
</p>
<p>imate business pursuits^
</p>
<p>In Com. V. Hunt, 4 Met. Ill, Chief Justice Shaw did not re-
</p>
<p>gard the union of workmen, under an agreement not to accept

</p>
<p>members of the association, or retain them after notice of the
</p>
<p>a^^reement, as in itself illegal, unless improper purposes were con-
</p>
<p>templated by the union. Such an agreement he held might be
</p>
<p>legal or illegal as its purpose was either to secure an advancement
</p>
<p>in the social or business life of its members, or to secure power
</p>
<p>for purposes of injustice or oppression. It was stated that if a
</p>
<p>large number of men, engaged for a iixed time, should combine
</p>
<p>together to violate their contracts, and quit their employment to-
</p>
<p>o;ether, it would be a conspiracy to do an unlawful act, which if
</p>
<p>done by one person, would give a civil action. It was considered
</p>
<p>that an association may be entered into, the object of which is to
</p>
<p>adopt measures that may have a tendency to impoverish another;
</p>
<p>that is, to diminish his gains and profits, and yet so far from being
</p>
<p>criminal or unlawful, the object may be highly meritorious and
</p>
<p>public spirited. The legality of such an association was therefore
</p>
<p>held to depend upon the means to be used for its accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment. If it is carried into effect by fair and honorable or lawful
</p>
<p>means, it is to say the least, innocent; if by falsehood or force it
</p>
<p>may be stamped with the character of conspiracy. The question
</p>
<p>of criminahty will be determined by the means, and they must be
</p>
<p>stated in the indictment. In Hartford Carpet Weavers Case
</p>
<p>{Super. Ct. Conn. 1836), and in Master Stevedores Asso. v. Walsh, 2
</p>
<p>Daly, 5, 1867, the right to regulate the price at which members
</p>
<p>of the union should work was recognized, and the same right was
</p>
<p>recognized on the part of employers to fix the M'ages they would
</p>
<p>pay. In the latter case the penalty was enforced against a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the association.
</p>
<p>In State v. Donaldson, 32 N. J. L. 151, 1867, notice was given
</p>
<p>to the employer by the confederated workman that they would
</p>
<p>quit his service unless two designated workmen were discharged.
</p>
<p>And the threat was carried into effect. Tliis was held an unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful combination, as attempting to dictate to the employer whom he
</p>
<p>should employ and whom discharge. It was declared to be an
</p>
<p>attempt to control the business of the employer. The case of

<p>Com. v. Hunt, 4 Met. Ill, is m the course of the opinion in State v.
</p>
<p>Donaldson approved, as in that case no purpose was shown to exer-
</p>
<p>cise such control over the employer, but simply to control its own
</p>
<p>members. The ruling in Com. v. Curren, 3 Pittsb. 143, in 1869,

<p>also denied the right of combined employes to dictate who shall

<p>be employed or discharged.
</p>
<p> 75. Statutes in England and the United States Regard-
</p>
<p>ing ComMnations among Workmen.  In England, the Act of
</p>
<p>1875, Concerning Conspiracy and for the Protection of Private
</p>
<p>Property, declares that " an agreement or combination of two or
</p>
<p>more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contempla-
</p>
<p>tion or furtherance of a trade dispute between employers and
</p>
<p>workmen, shall not be indictable as a conspiracy, if such act com-
</p>
<p>mitted by one person would not be punishable as a crime."  3.
</p>
<p>The law is now well settled that workmen have a right to com-
</p>
<p>bine for their own protection, and to obtain such wages as they
</p>
<p>may themselves, after consideration, agree to insist upon receiving
</p>
<p>for their work;' and while they are perfectly free from engage-
</p>
<p>ment, and at liberty to exercise the option of entering into
</p>
<p>employ or not, they have a right to agree among themselves not
</p>
<p>to accept any employ unless they can secure a certain rate of
</p>
<p>wages.''
</p>
<p>Associations of workingmen for mntual protection and improve-
</p>
<p>ment under the names of " Friendly Societies " are made quasi
</p>
<p>corporate bodies, and their regulations and rules are often the test
</p>
<p>of the legality of their organization and existence.
</p>
<p>In Farrer v. Close, L. K. 4 Q. B. 612, Cockburn, Oh. J"., and
</p>
<p>Mellor, e/i, held that the evidence in this case showed that the
</p>
<p>rules in practice are applied so as to render the funds of the soci-
</p>
<p>ety in question available for the purpose of supporting strikes, by
</p>
<p>allowing sums of money to workmen in order to prevent them
</p>
<p>from seeking work in distiicts where men are on a strike, and
</p>
<p>also by giving assistance to other branch associations in whose
</p>
<p>districts strikes are going on ; that these purposes are not of a
</p>
<p>friendly society, but of a trade's union, and as such, are illegal as
</p>
<p>being in restraint of trade, according to Hornby v. Close, L. K. 2
</p>
<p>Q. B. 153, and that the justices trying the case were right in so
</p>
<p>ruling.

<p>whether a certain society called the Amalgamated Society of Car-

</p>
<p>as to be within the protection of 18 and 19 Vict. chap. 63,  24

<p>being applied to carry out the purposes of a friendly society, or
</p>
<p>those of a trade's union, and while carrying on its operations as a
</p>
<p>trade's union evade the law and obtain advantages secured by
</p>
<p>statute to a friendly society, which would be refused to it if its
</p>
<p>true character were known."
</p>
<p>Hannen, /., said : " Strikes are not necessarily illegal. A
</p>
<p>strike is properly defined as ' a shnultaneous cessation of work on
</p>
<p>the part of the workmen,' and its legality or illegality must
</p>
<p>depend upon the means by which it is enforced and on its objects.
</p>
<p>Xo doubt the trade of the employer is restrained when workmen
</p>
<p>decline to take the wages which he is willing to give ; but it must
</p>
<p>be remembered that the men are contractors as well as the em-
</p>
<p>ployers, and it would be an odd way of promoting the freedom of
</p>
<p>trade to hold it an illegal purpose on their part to endeavor, out
</p>
<p>of their own savings, to put themselves in a better position to get
</p>
<p>what they think is a fair price for their labor. The question,
</p>
<p>whether a society has been established for illegal purposes or not
</p>
<p>ought, with rare exceptions, to be decided by the rules themselves
</p>
<p>which declare the objects of the society and speak the voices of
</p>
<p>all its members. To explain and interpret these rules by vague
</p>
<p>general evidence of what may be sometimes done, is objectionable
</p>
<p>on principle as explaining written documents by loose parol evi-

<p>dence as to the construction put upon them by different officers,
</p>
<p>and as such construction might vary from time to time, the result
</p>
<p>would be to throw the proper meaning and effect of the rules into
</p>
<p>the utmost uncertainty and confusion.
</p>
<p>oiO CONSPIRACV AT COMMON LAW  CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>If rules are leii;al in themselves, it is the duty of the officers to
</p>
<p>carry them out legally. The objects of the rule may be abused,
</p>
<p>in practice, but if in such case the abuse is the fault of individu-
</p>
<p>als, it ought not to be viewed as affecting the rules themselves or
</p>
<p>the general purposes of the society to which they belong. If the
</p>
<p>printed rules are not the real rules of an association, and if a
</p>
<p>society under pretense of being a benevolent institution, is
</p>
<p>really a scheme in whole or in part designed for the support and
</p>
<p>encouragements of illegal strikes, the society must be deemed to
</p>
<p>be established for an illegal purpose.'"
</p>
<p>Two important decisions in trades-union cases have recently
</p>
<p>been made in England' by Chief Justice Coleridge and the asso-
</p>
<p>ciate justices of the court of Queen's Bench that serve to define
</p>
<p>what, in law, constitutes "intimidation" in connection with
</p>
<p>*' strikes." While there is no law against strikes as such, intimi-
</p>
<p>dation is held to be illegal and is indeed declared to be so by stat-
</p>
<p>ute. Every workman has the right to " strike," and so far as the
</p>
<p>law is concerned he is the sole judge of the reasonableness of his
</p>
<p>action in the premises. But he has no right to intimidate ; and
</p>
<p>the same law which will uphold him in his liberty to act in com-
</p>
<p>bination with others for the advancement of the interests of his
</p>
<p>trade will punish anything on his part that can be properly con-
</p>
<p>strued to be intimidation. What, then, is intimidation within the
</p>
<p>meaning of the law ?
</p>
<p>A coal merchant of Plymouth, with a large trade, especially in
</p>
<p>supplying steamers touching at that port, employed four gangs of
</p>
<p>hands to unload the colliers. Three of those gangs were com-
</p>
<p>posed of union men, and those who made up the fourth belonged
</p>
<p>to no union. The secretaries of the three imions came to the coal
</p>
<p>merchant and ordered him to dismiss his non-union men, under a
</p>
<p>threat that, in case of a failure to comply, they would withdraw
</p>
<p>the union workmen, and so leave him short-handed, in a way to
</p>
<p>cripple his business at a busy time. The coal merchant refused ;
</p>
<p>a strike was ordered, and the union men went out.

<p>The secretaries of the unions were immediately prosecuted

<p>under the statute forbidding intimidation, and the court found

</p>
<p>tliem guilty oil tLe ground that tlie threat wliich accompanied
</p>
<p>their demand amounted to intimidation. On appeal this decision
</p>
<p>was reversed, Lord Coleridge holding that a threat to notify the
</p>
<p>men to leave their work, unaccompanied by violence or any
</p>
<p>menace of violence, cannot be called intimidation within the
</p>
<p>English Conspiracy Act of 1875, 38 k, 39 Yict. chap. 86,  7,
</p>
<p>sub. 1, which makes it an offense for one to " use violence to or
</p>
<p>intimidate," etc., to compel another to do or abstain from doing
</p>
<p>an act which he has a legal right to abstain from or to do. Of
</p>
<p>course, the final decision would have been otherwise had there
</p>
<p>been any recourse to or threat of violence. It seems, therefore,
</p>
<p>that a threat, in order to sustain a legal charge of intimidation,
</p>
<p>under the English Conspiracy Act, must at least imply some act
</p>
<p>that would justify a magistrate in binding the offender over to
</p>
<p>keep the peace.
</p>
<p>Another decision of the court below to the effect that a "strike
</p>
<p>which could have the effect of injuring an employer is illegal and
</p>
<p>indictable " was unhesitatingly reversed.
</p>
<p>In the different states legislation has been had upon the subject
</p>
<p>of trade conspiracies and the rights of the employer and employe
</p>
<p>In Alabama, the Code of 1886, Vol. 2, part 5, title 2,  3763^
</p>
<p>declares that any person Mdio, by force or threats of violence to
</p>
<p>person or pi-operty, prevents or seeks to prevent another from
</p>
<p>doing work or furnishing materials, or from contracting to do
</p>
<p>work or furnish materials for or to any person engaged in any
</p>
<p>lawful business, or who disturbs, interferes with or prevents the
</p>
<p>peaceable exercise of any lawful industry, business or calling by
</p>
<p>any other person, must, on conviction, be fined not less than ten^
</p>
<p>nor more than five hundred dollars, and may also be imprisoned
</p>
<p>in the county jail or sentenced to hard labor for the county for
</p>
<p>not more than twelve months. Under this Act any two or more
</p>
<p>persons conspiring together to violate the Statute, and doing some
</p>
<p>act to carry their agreement into effect, are each guilty of the
</p>
<p>offense of conspiracy.*

<p>In Maryland, under the title of "Conspiracy," it is enacted that:

<p>in weavino-, and one Jogiali Perrv. a Worcester Conntv manufac-
</p>
<p>turerer, lias been convicted under the Act, and on appeal an attack
</p>
<p>is made before the Supreme Court of the State on the constitu-
</p>
<p>tionality of the legislation. It is said in argument that there is no-
</p>
<p>authority which the people of Massachusetts have conferred upon
</p>
<p>the Legislature to prescribe by law what prices shall be paid for
</p>
<p>labor where parties competent to contract make contracts for its
</p>
<p>performance and for the price to be paid for it. The Legislature
</p>
<p>cannot fix by law the amount which an employe shall be entitled
</p>
<p>to receive. Neither is there any power given to the Legislature
</p>
<p>to require by law that poor services shall receive the same com-
</p>
<p>pensation as that which is better and therefore worth more.
</p>
<p>These positions, as abstract propositions, are undoubtedly true.
</p>
<p>But the precise question to be determined is whether the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture has the constitutional right to decide that citizens of the State
</p>
<p>shall not make a contract, which involves the possibility of a
</p>
<p>reduction in wages for imperfection in the product, whether
</p>
<p>caused by faulty machinery or otherwise. "Whether such a law is
</p>
<p>Avise or not is not in the issue. The court is called upon to decide
</p>
<p>whether the Legislature cannot enact such a law. The appeal is
</p>
<p>still pending in the court.
</p>
<p>In Michigan the intimidation of employes is forbidden, in sec-
</p>
<p>tion 9274, and under the lieading ''Obstructing or Conspiring to
</p>
<p>Obstruct Business of Corporations," it is provided,  9274, that:

<p>If any person or persons shall willfully or maliciously, by any act

</p>
<p>The manufacture of chjthing is one of the largest industries of
</p>
<p>many that are carried on in the city of Rochester, New York.
</p>
<p>According to the report of the Board of Arbitration, the annual
</p>
<p>output of ready-made clothing reaches $10,000,000 in value, the
</p>
<p>annual aggregate of wages is $3,000,000, and the employes, men,
</p>
<p>women, and children, including about 5,000 families, number
</p>
<p>about 20,000, or about one seventh the entire population of tlie
</p>
<p>city. Early in March, 1891, this great industry came to a stand-
</p>
<p>still through the combined action of twenty-one manufacturing
</p>
<p>firms in dismissing the cutters in their employ, about 350 in all.
</p>
<p>All of the dismissed men were members of a local assem])ly of
</p>
<p>Knights of Labor, and the reason which their employers gave for
</p>
<p>their course was that they were unable to continue their business
</p>
<p>because of the insistance, on the part of the national organization
</p>
<p>of the Knights, on the right to dictate to the employers the terms
</p>
<p>upon which the local Knights should be employed. The sudden
</p>
<p>arrest of a great industry produced the results inevitable in such
</p>
<p>cases. There was destitution and suffering in thousands of fami-
</p>
<p>lies, and the industrial and commercial life of the city received a
</p>
<p>violent shock. Indictments were found against officers of the
</p>
<p>national organization of the Knights of Labor, and a conviction
</p>
<p>was had, and the appeal is now pending before the general term

<p>State Board of Arbitration, during the pending difficulty, put in
</p>
<p>an appearance and made unavailing efforts to harmonize the differ-
</p>
<p>ences between the manufacturers and employes. It then began an
</p>
<p>investigation into the cause of the trouble, sitting for three days
</p>
<p>and going into the subject with great thoroughness. It made a

<p>To the Legislature :
</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 7th instant, twenty-one individual, firm, and
</p>
<p>corporation manufacturers of clothing, who constitute the Clothiers'
</p>
<p>Exchange of the city of Rochester, dismissed the cutters in their
</p>
<p>employ, who number about 350, and are organized in a local
</p>
<p>assembly of the Knights of Labor, which has relations with a
</p>
<p>national organization of that order. The manufacture of clothing
</p>
<p>is the most extensive of the many industries carried on in Roch-
</p>
<p>ester, which is now the largest interior city of the State, with a
</p>
<p>growth in population from 90,000 in 1880 to 140,000 in 1890.
</p>
<p>The aimual volume of theout-put of ready-made clothing reaches
</p>
<p>$10,000,(>00 in value, and the annual wages paid aggregate
</p>
<p>$3,000,000, distributed among the working members, men, women
</p>
<p>and children, of about 5,000 families, numbering about 20,000
</p>
<p>persons, or nearly fifteen per cent of the inhabitants. As the
</p>
<p>Clothiers' Exchange embraces the principal manufacturers in the
</p>
<p>city, and as the closing of the cutting departments causes a cessa-
</p>
<p>tion of work all along the line, it is easy to see, from the figures
</p>
<p>given, the local importance that attaches to the lockout.
</p>
<p>There are some features of the revelations made by the inves-
</p>
<p>tigation, and of the present situation, of such general concern as

<p>not to be unworthy of the attention of the Legislature. By the

<p>in this case, does not conduce to harmony between the parties, and
</p>
<p>is not calculated to improve their present or any other system of
</p>
<p>production. On the contrary, it would seem that, sooner or later,
</p>
<p>the consequence must be disruption of relations and destruction
</p>
<p>of industries. Like causes produce like effects, and the spectacle
</p>
<p>presented in Rochester to-day may be witnessed in the other
</p>
<p>industrial centers of the State to-morrow. It is clearly the prov-
</p>
<p>ince of all persons who choose do so, to combine their skill and
</p>
<p>labor, put a price upon their use, and sell that use to whomsoever
</p>
<p>they please, or hold it in idleness as they please. But it is as clearly
</p>
<p>not the right of any person, upon failure of negotiations of a sat-
</p>
<p>isfactory sale of the use of their skill and labor to others persons
</p>
<p>who desire such use, to engage in an attempt at avowed destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of the ])usiness of those other persons because they refuse to
</p>
<p>accede to terms and conditions demanded of and not agreeable to
</p>
<p>them, and then make traffic of desistance. It is suggested that,
</p>
<p>in so far as the laws of the State of New York fail to protect
</p>
<p>employers and employes alike in their prerogative of equal right
</p>
<p>to buy or sell the use of skill and labor, they are deficient and at
</p>
<p>fault as not " conducive to harmonizing the relations of, and dis-
</p>
<p>putes between, employers and wage-earning masses," or to the
</p>
<p>'^ improvement of the present system of production," and should
</p>
<p>be amended to those most desirable ends set forth by the Legisla-

<p>An interesting decision has been rendered by the United States

<p>A suit for an injunction was brought by Lewis E. Casey, editor
</p>
<p>and proprietor of The Covington (Ky.) Commonwealth, to restrain
</p>
<p>Typographical Union No. 3 of Cincinnati from boycotting the
</p>
<p>complainant and his newspaper. The complaint alleges that the
</p>
<p>said union demanded of the proprietor of The Commonwealth
</p>
<p>that he should conduct his paper according to the customs, rules
</p>
<p>and regulations adopted by that organization; that he should pay
</p>
<p>his employes such rates as the union might from time to time
</p>
<p>prescribe, and that he should discharge from his employment all
</p>
<p>persons who were not members of it. Upon his refusal to com-
</p>
<p>ply with these demands the defendants, it is averred, illegally and
</p>
<p>with intent to injure the complainant and to destroy the circula-
</p>
<p>tion of his newspaper and its value as an advertising medium,
</p>
<p>caused to be printed and posted in conspicuous places large hand-
</p>
<p>bills calling upon all persons to withdraw their patronage from
</p>
<p>The Commonwealth; that they issued circulars to its advertising
</p>
<p>patrons requesting them to cease advertising and threatening, in
</p>
<p>case of their refusal, that they would be visited by the ill-will and
</p>
<p>incur the enmity of all organized labor. Circulars were also sent
</p>
<p>to news agents handling the complainant's paper stating that if
</p>
<p>they continued to sell it they would be exposed to the hostility of
</p>
<p>the labor organizations.
</p>
<p>The defendants filed no answer, but upon the argument of the
</p>
<p>motion for an injunction submitted several affidavits, in which
</p>
<p>they acknowledged making the demands and having sent the cir-

<p>but denied that they made any threats or menaces, or that such

<p>members of Typographical Union No. 3 and to employers who
</p>
<p>were friendly to that organization and like unions of organized
</p>
<p>labor. Such substantially was the issue made up before the court
</p>
<p>and upon it the defendants' counsel maintained, first, that tlie
</p>
<p>complainant was not entitled to an injunction from a court of
</p>
<p>equity, but must seek a remedy by civil action or an indictment
</p>
<p>in the criminal courts; and second, that the defendants in all they
</p>
<p>did were simply pursuing a course of lawful competition.
</p>
<p>The opinion delivered by Justice Sage is an elaborate review
</p>
<p>of the present state of law upon the subject of illegal trade com-
</p>
<p>binations and conspiracies.
</p>
<p>After the presentation of the facts upon the hearing of the
</p>
<p>motion, the court called upon counsel for the defendants to state
</p>
<p>the grounds of their objections to the granting of an injunction.
</p>
<p>They first challenged the jurisdiction in equity, citing several
</p>
<p>cases. '
</p>
<p>Kidd V. Horry, 28 Fed. Rep. 773, was an application to restrain
</p>
<p>the defendant by injunction from publishing certain circulars
</p>
<p>alleged to be libelous and injurious to complainants' patent-rights
</p>
<p>and business, and from making and uttering libelous and slander-
</p>
<p>ous statements concerning the validity of complainants' letters-
</p>
<p>patent or their title thereto, or concerning their business, during
</p>
<p>the pendency of a suit to restrain the infringement of said patents.
</p>
<p>Justice Bradley, who decided the case, in the course of his opin-
</p>
<p>ion said that the application rested principally upon a line of
</p>
<p>recent English authorities, which depended on certain acts of

<p>well considered judgment of a court, had introduced this new
</p>
<p>branch of equity into our jurisprudence. "There may be a case
</p>
<p>or two looking that way, but none that we deem of sufficient
</p>
<p>authority to justify us in assuming the jurisdiction. . . . "VVe
</p>
<p>do not think that the existence of malice in publishing a libel, or
</p>
<p>uttering slanderous words, can make any difference in the juris-
</p>
<p>diction of the court. Malice is charged in almost every case of
</p>
<p>libel, and no cases of authority can be found, we think, independ-
</p>
<p>ent of statutes, in which the power to issue an injunction to re-
</p>
<p>strain a libel or slanderous words has ever been maintained,
</p>
<p>whether malice was charged or not."
</p>
<p>This case was approved and followed in Baltimore Wheel Co.
</p>
<p>Y. Bemis, 29 Fed. Rep. 95, by Judges Colt and Carpenter, in the
</p>
<p>United States Circuit Court of Massachusetts.'
</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Gray was then the Chief Justice of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court of Massachusetts, and pronounced the opinion, holding that
</p>
<p>'%e jurisdiction of a court of chancery does not extend to cases
</p>
<p>of libel or of slander or of false representations as to the character
</p>
<p>or quality of the plaintifE's property, or as to his title thereto,
</p>
<p>which involves no breach of trust or of contract." Upon the
</p>
<p>authority of this case, and of I^radentlal Assur. Co. v. Knotty
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held in Whitehead v. I{it-
</p>
<p>son, 119 Mass. 481, that there was no jurisdiction in equity to
</p>
<p>restrain a person falsely representing that the plaintiff's patent
</p>
<p>infringed a patent owned by himself, and thereby deterring others-
</p>
<p>from purchasing the plaintiff's invention.
</p>
<p>The case in T Daly was upon a motion to vacate a preliminary

</p>
<p>as stated, and that the matter published was defamatory and
</p>
<p>libelous, the defendants could not be restrained hj a court of
</p>
<p>equity, and that those injured must seek their remedy by a civil
</p>
<p>action, or by an indictment in the criminal courts; the exercise of
</p>
<p>an equitable jurisdiction to restrain publications being repugnant
</p>
<p>to the constitutional provision that every citizen may freely speak,
</p>
<p>write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible
</p>
<p>ior the abuse of that right, and that no law should be passed to
</p>
<p>restrain the liberty of speech and of the press.
</p>
<p>In Prudential Assur. Co. v. Knott the court was asked to re-
</p>
<p>strain the publication of a pamphlet which, it was charged, con-
</p>
<p>tained false statements of the rates of premium charged by com-
</p>
<p>plainant, and represented the company as being managed with
</p>
<p>reckless extravagance, and as being in a state of insolvency, and
</p>
<p>unable to f ultill its engagements; and it was averred that the con-
</p>
<p>tinued publication would be very injurious to the company's credit,
</p>
<p>and could not fail greatly to damage its business and diminish its
</p>
<p>profits. Hall, T^. C, refused to grant an injunction, and the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, by way of appeal, applied to Lord Cairns, L. C, who
</p>
<p>held that there was no ground whatever for the interference of
</p>
<p>the court; that if the publications did not amount to libels, and
</p>
<p>were therefore innocuous and justifiable in the eye of the court
</p>
<p>of common law, he was at a loss to understand upon what princi-
</p>
<p>ple the court of chancery could interfere; and if, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, the comments were liljelous, it was clearly settled that the
</p>
<p>court of chancery had no jurisdiction to restrain their publication.
</p>
<p>In Rlchter v. pJourneymen Tailors Union^ a similar rule was
</p>
<p>applied. In that caie the petition set forth that the defendant
</p>
<p>unlawfully combined and conspired to break uj) and destroy plain-
</p>
<p>tiff's business, and that in order to accomplish that purpose they
</p>
<p>maliciously compelled plaintiff's employes to quit working for
</p>
<p>him and prevented others from working for him. The means by
</p>
<p>which this was accomplished were not specified. "Whether it
</p>
<p>was done by moral suasion, by argument, by reason, or by intimi-

</p>
<p>dation and violence, is not shown by either the petition or the
</p>
<p>evidence." All that did appear was that the defendants printed
</p>
<p>and published circulars, and that the plaintiff had lost customers
</p>
<p>because the latter had heard that plaintiff was employing scab
</p>
<p>STATUTES IN ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES. 303
</p>
<p>or inferior tailors. It was not shown from what source tlie alien-
</p>
<p>ated customers derived their information, but it was assumed by
</p>
<p>counsel for the plaintiff that it was from the circulars. The court
</p>
<p>held that the only question before it was whether it could enjoin
</p>
<p>the pul)lication of a. libel, and that the only remedy against such
</p>
<p>publication was at law. To the same effect is Mayer v. Journey'
</p>
<p>men Stone-Cntters Asso. Indeed, the law as stated in all these
</p>
<p>cases is so thoroughly established as to be beyond controversy,
</p>
<p>and it is not necessary to refer more particularly to other cases
</p>
<p>cited in support of it. Francis v. Flinn, 118 U. S. 385, 30 L.
</p>
<p>ed. 165, is quite as strong an authority as any cited.
</p>
<p>But the question is whether Casey v. Cincinnati Typographical
</p>
<p>Union, falls within the rule. That the defendant, the Typo-
</p>
<p>graphical Union, set on foot a boycott against the complainant, as
</p>
<p>stated in the bill, and in the affidavits on file, is not denied. That
</p>
<p>this boycott was to be enforced by threatening loss of business to
</p>
<p>those who, having no connection with the Union, should continue to
</p>
<p>advertise with, or in any way patronize, the complainant, is clear-
</p>
<p>ly shown. True, it is claimed that no threats were used ; but the
</p>
<p>language of the circulars has no doul)tful meaning. The affidavits
</p>
<p>on file show that it was perfectly understood l)y those who
</p>
<p>received them ; and the circumstances indicate that it was intend-
</p>
<p>ed that it should be so understood. In Brace v. Evans (Pa.) 13
</p>
<p>Hy. & Corp. L. J. 561, it was held that the word " boycott " is in
</p>
<p>itself a threat. " In popular acceptation it is an organized effort
</p>
<p>to exclude a person from business relations witii others, by per-
</p>
<p>suasion, intimidation and other acts which tend to violence, and
</p>
<p>thereby coerce him, through fear of resulting injury, to submit to
</p>
<p>dictation in the management of his affairs." But it is insisted for
</p>
<p>the defendants that every representation of fact contained in their
</p>
<p>hand-bills and circulars is true; that is to sa}', that the complain-
</p>
<p>ant had, in 1888, broken with the Typographical Union, dis-
</p>
<p>charged all union employes, and had since that date employed
</p>
<p>only those who were not meml)ers of the Union ; and that after

<p>repeatedly promising to unionize his office he had finally, in Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, 1890, refused to do so, and declared that he would not
</p>
<p>employ any person who was connected with the Union. All
</p>
<p>these are conceded facts. Therefore, argue counsel for the
</p>
<p>364 CONSPIKACY AT COMMON LAW CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>defendants, this is only a case of lawful competition. The com-
</p>
<p>plainant having declared that he would not employ any member
</p>
<p>of the Union, the Union had a right to say that its members
</p>
<p>w^oiild not patronize the complainant. Nobody disputes that
</p>
<p>proposition. If that were all that is involv'ed in this case, there
</p>
<p>wonld be nothing for the court to act upon. But it is not all by
</p>
<p>any means. Instead of "fair, although sharp and bitter, compe-
</p>
<p>tition," as is contended by counsel, it was an attempt, by coercion,,
</p>
<p>to destroy all competition affecting the Union. It was an organ-
</p>
<p>ized conspiracy to force the complainant to yield his right to
</p>
<p>select his own workmen, and submit himself to the contrtl uf tlie
</p>
<p>Union, and allow it to regulate prices for him, and to determine
</p>
<p>whom he should employ and M'hom discharge. In other words,
</p>
<p>it was and is an organized effort to force prijiters to come into the
</p>
<p>Union, or be driven from their calling for want of employment,.,
</p>
<p>and to make the destruction of the complainant's business the
</p>
<p>penalty for his refusing to surrender to the Union. Whatever
</p>
<p>moral obligation may have ])een incurred by complainant by rea-
</p>
<p>son of his promises to unionize his office, they were wholly with-
</p>
<p>out consideration, and they amount to nothing whatever in law or
</p>
<p>in equity.
</p>
<p>No case has been cited where, upon a proper showing of facts,,
</p>
<p>an unsuccessful appeal has been made to a court of chancery tO'
</p>
<p>restrain a boycott. The authorities are all the other way. At
</p>
<p>common law an agreement to control the will of employers by
</p>
<p>improper molestation was an illegal conspiracy. In New York it
</p>
<p>has been held that the "boycott'- is a conspiracy in restraint of
</p>
<p>trade.' So also in Virginia.^ And in Connecticut.'' And in
</p>
<p>England.^
</p>
<p>In Emack y. Kane, 34 Fed. Kep. 47, the United States Circuit
</p>
<p>Court for the Northern District of Illinois held that equity had

</p>
<p>and the proof showing, that tlie charges of infringement were not
</p>
<p>made in good faith, but with maUcious intent to injure complain-
</p>
<p>ant's business. Judge Blodgett recognized, in his decision, the
</p>
<p>authority of Kldd v. Horry^ and Baltimore Wheel Co. v. Bemis,
</p>
<p>29 Fed. Rep. 95, cited for the defendants in this case, but said
</p>
<p>that the case before him was fairly different and distinguishable
</p>
<p>from those cases in a material and vital feature. In those cases
</p>
<p>the interference of the court was sought to restrain the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of libelous attacks upon the property of the complainant. In
</p>
<p>Emack v. Kane., 34 Fed. Rep. 47, the gist of the complaint was
</p>
<p>that the publications were only means employed to carry into
</p>
<p>effect a malicious intent to injure and destroy the complainant's
</p>
<p>business. Judge Blodgett said : ' I cannot believe that a man is
</p>
<p>remediless against persistent and continued attacks upon his busi-
</p>
<p>ness, such as have been perpetrated by these defendants against
</p>
<p>the complainant, as shown by the proofs in this case. It shocks
</p>
<p>my sense of justice to say that a court of equity cannot restrain
</p>
<p>systematic and methodical outrages like this by one man upon
</p>
<p>another's property rights. If a court of equity cannot restrain an
</p>
<p>attack like this upon a man's business, then the party is certainly
</p>
<p>remediless, because an action at law, in most cases, would do no
</p>
<p>good, and ruin would be accomplished before' an adjudication
</p>
<p>would be reached. True, it may be said that the injured party
</p>
<p>has a remedy at law ; but that might imply a multiplicity of suits,
</p>
<p>which equity often interposes to relieve from. But the still
</p>
<p>more cogent reason seems to be that a court of equity can, by its
</p>
<p>writ of injunction, restrain a wrong-doer, and thus prevent hi ju-
</p>
<p>ries which could not be fully redressed by a verdict and judgment
</p>
<p>for damages at law. Redress for a mere personal slander or libel
</p>
<p>may perhaps properly be left to the courts of law, because no
</p>
<p>falsehood, however gross and malicious, can wholly destroy a
</p>
<p>man's reputation with those who know him ; but statements and
</p>
<p>charges intended to frighten away a man's customers, and inthu-
</p>
<p>idate them from dealing with him, may wholly break up and ruin

</p>
<p>him financially with no adequate remedy if a court of equity can-
</p>
<p>not afford protection by its restraining writ."
</p>
<p>This is a clear and forcible statement of the law, and is in
</p>
<p>accord with the general current of authority.
</p>
<p>366 CONSPIRACY AT COMMON LAW CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>How strongly it applies in this case may be readily seen by
</p>
<p>referring to the editoi'ials in the Bulletin, the organ of the union,
</p>
<p>and to the hand-bills and circulars set forth in the statement of
</p>
<p>facts. The editorial in the Bulletin of December 1 declares that
</p>
<p>the boycott " is still on, and will be until the proprietor of the
</p>
<p>' rat ' sheet employs union men." It requests " all K. of L.
</p>
<p>assemblies, unions and workingmen to bear in mind that Mr.
</p>
<p>Casey refused to employ or in any way recognize organized
</p>
<p>labor." It asks their aid in compelling complainant to recognize
</p>
<p>the rights of labor by withdrawing their patronage from his
</p>
<p>paper, and if possible let him know why. It calls upon them not
</p>
<p>to patronize any merchants who advertise in complainant's news-
</p>
<p>paper, and if they see the paper in any place of business to refuse
</p>
<p>to buy goods unless the merchant immediately stops the " rat "
</p>
<p>sheet. The connnunication sent by the union on the 3d of
</p>
<p>[N^ovember to Messrs. Griffin, agents for the sale of complainant's
</p>
<p>paper, contains the following :
</p>
<p>" This union will consider it a great favor for you to give up
</p>
<p>the agency of The Commonwealth. If you do not do so, we will
</p>
<p>have to consider you the enemy of organized labor."
</p>
<p>These are fair samples, and they indicate the method by which
</p>
<p>the boycott was to be made eifective. Yet counsel say that there
</p>
<p>were no threats ; that the defendants were only exercising their
</p>
<p>constitutional right to freely speak and publish their opinions ;,
</p>
<p>that what defendants have done is a necessary and natural and
</p>
<p>proper incident of bitter, but yet lawful, competition, and that
</p>
<p>this was only fair argument and persuasion. These propositions
</p>
<p>are in direct conflict with decisions made long ago, and recognized
</p>
<p>in all subsequent cases. In Rex v. Eccles, 1 Leach, 274, the
</p>
<p>defendants were indicted for conspiring to impoverish a tailor,,
</p>
<p>and by direct means to prevent him from carrying on his trade.
</p>
<p>They were convicted, and upon a motion in arrest of judgment it
</p>
<p>was objected that the indictment ought to have stated the acts
</p>
<p>that were committed to impoverish the tailor and to prevent him

</p>
<p>from carrying on his trade in order that the defendants might
</p>
<p>tliereby have notice of the particular charges they were called
</p>
<p>upon to answer. But Lord Mansfield, without hearing the prose-
</p>
<p>cution, said that that was certainly not necessary. " The offense
</p>
<p>STATUTES IN ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES. 361
</p>
<p>does not consist in doing the acts by which the mischief is
</p>
<p>effected,  for they may l)e perfectly indifferent,  but the con-
</p>
<p>spiring with a view to effect the intended mischief by any means.
</p>
<p>The illegal combination is the gist of the offense," See also Re
</p>
<p>Wahash R. Co. 24 Fed. Eep. 217. In that case the following
</p>
<p>notice was sent to various foremen of the shops of the railroad
</p>
<p>company, during a strike organized to resist a reduction of wages,
</p>
<p>the railroad company being at that time in the hands of a
</p>
<p>receiver appointed by the United States circuit court:
</p>
<p>"Office of Local Committee,
</p>
<p>"June 17, 1885.
</p>
<p>" , Foreman: You are requested to stay away from
</p>
<p>the shop until the present difficulty is settled. Your compliance
</p>
<p>with this will command the protection of the Wabash emj)loyes.
</p>
<p>But in no case are you to consider this an intimidation.
</p>
<p>" Held, that this was an unlawful interference with the man-
</p>
<p>agement of the road by the receiver, and a contempt of court, for
</p>
<p>which the writer should be punished."
</p>
<p>The court, in passing upon the case, said : " The statement in.
</p>
<p>all these notices that they are not to be taken as intimidation goes
</p>
<p>to show beyond a doubt that the writer knew he was violaiing-
</p>
<p>the law, and by this subterfuge sought to escape its penalty."
</p>
<p>In Urdted States v. Kane, 23 Fed. Eep. 748, Judge Brewer,
</p>
<p>after stating that " every man has a right to work for whom he
</p>
<p>pleases, and go where he pleases, provided in so doing he does
</p>
<p>not trespass on the rights of others," by way of illustrating what
</p>
<p>is a threat, supposes that one of two workmen is discharged. The
</p>
<p>other is satisiied with his employment and wishes to stay. The
</p>
<p>discharged workman comes with a large party of his friends,
</p>
<p>armed with revolvers and muskets, and says : " Now my friends
</p>
<p>are here  you better leave  I request you to leave." In terms
</p>
<p>there is no threat, but it is a request, backed by a demonstration
</p>
<p>of force, intended and calculated to intimidate, and the man
</p>
<p>leaves really because he is mtunidated. Again, armed robbers

</p>
<p>which was complied with. The court said that any jiidsje who
</p>
<p>would recognize such a defense deserved to be despised, and the
</p>
<p>0urt was right.
</p>
<p>In t^tate v. Glidden, 3 New Eng. Rep. 84-9, 55 Conn. 46, cited
</p>
<p>hereinbefore, Judge Carpenter, speaking for the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>of Connecticut, states that the defendants said in effect to the
</p>
<p>publishing company : " You shall discharge men you have in
</p>
<p>your employ, and you shall hereafter employ only such men as
</p>
<p>we shall name. It is true, we have no interest in your business ;
</p>
<p>we have no capital invested therein ; we are in no wise responsible
</p>
<p>for its losses or failure ; we are not directly benefited by its suc-
</p>
<p>cess ; and we do not participate in its profits  yet we have a right
</p>
<p>to control its management, and compel you to submit to our dic-
</p>
<p>tation."
</p>
<p>The court said that the bare assertion of such a right was start-
</p>
<p>ling ; that, if it existed, all business enterprises were alike subject
</p>
<p>to the dictation and control of those who asserted it, and upon,
</p>
<p>the same principle and for the same reason the right to determine
</p>
<p>what business men shall engage in, and when and where and how
</p>
<p>it shall be carried on, will be demanded, and must be conceded to
</p>
<p>associations of workingmen of the class of tliose whom it would
</p>
<p>be necessary to employ. The opinion in this case, although the
</p>
<p>case itself arose upon an indictment for conspiracy, is a well con-
</p>
<p>sidered discussion of the law with relation to boycotting. All
</p>
<p>associations designed to interfere with the perfect freedom of em-
</p>
<p>ployers in the proper management and control of their lawful
</p>
<p>business, or to dictate in any particular terms upon which their

<p>business shall be conducted, by means of threats, or by interfer-
</p>

<p>ment of other persons, are pi'O tanto illegal combinations or asso-

</p>
<p>kind of work, but to confine himself to work designated by the
</p>
<p>writer, is an unwarrantable interference with the business.'
</p>
<p>In the light of these authorities it is idle to talk about the de-
</p>
<p>fendants' acts and publications as- mere incidents of a competition
</p>
<p>set on foot by complainant's declaration that he would not employ
</p>
<p>union printers ; that the publications are shielded by constitutional
</p>
<p>guaranties ; or that, viewed in the most unfavorable light, they
</p>
<p>are nothing more than libels, and the only remedy for any injury
</p>
<p>resulting is by an action at law.
</p>
<p>It is claimed that the recital in the aflidavit of Davis of what
</p>
<p>was said to him by the managers of the advertising department of
</p>
<p>Mabley & Carew 'and of F^chheimer Bros. & Co., when they
</p>
<p>withdrew their patronage from The Commonwealth, to wit, that
</p>
<p>it was because they had been visited by a committee of the Typo-
</p>
<p>graphical Union, and were threatened with the loss of business,
</p>
<p>ought not to be considered, because it is hearsay.
</p>
<p>There are two answers to this claim :
</p>
<p>First. What was said is clearly admissible as part of the res
</p>
<p>gestce, to show the state of mind of the persons in doing the act
</p>
<p>which their declarations accompanied.
</p>
<p>Second. Upon the hearing of a motion for a preliminary injunc-
</p>
<p>tion, the rules of evidence are applied less strictly than upon the
</p>
<p>final hearing of the cause, and consequently evidence that would
</p>
<p>not be competent in support of an application for a perpetual
</p>
<p>injunction should be admitted.*
</p>
<p>The reason for the rule is plain. Probability of right is suffi-
</p>
<p><iient to authorize a preliminary injunction. In many cases it is
</p>
<p>granted to preserve property in statu quo during the pendency
</p>
<p>of a suit in which the rights to it are to be decided, and that with-
</p>
<p>out expressing, and oftentimes without having the means of form-
</p>
<p>ing, any opinion as to such rights.'
</p>
<p>The rule, with the reason for it, applies with peculiar force
</p>
<p>when it is sought to exclude the statements referred to from con-
</p>
<p>sideration. The advertising managers made haste to deny that

<p>any threats were uttered to them by anybody representing the-

</p>
<p>was said, nor did they deny that they withdrew their advertise-
</p>
<p>ments from The Commonwealth, nor intimate any reason for so
</p>
<p>doing other than that stated by Davis. It is not now the proper
</p>
<p>occasion to consider fully what promj)ted their denials. That,
</p>
<p>in the judgment of the court, should be reserved until the final
</p>
<p>hearing, after full opportunity to cross-examine Davis upon the
</p>
<p>one hand, and the advertising managers who made the denials

<p>National Liberal Federation Conference, held in Memorial Hall,
</p>
<p>Farringdon Street, London, urged the abolition of the common

<p>future legislation :
</p>
<p>" We must provide for the rural population of Great Britain as

</p>
<p>whether the legislation referred to in the preceding chapter has
</p>
<p>materially changed the common law as it existed in this country,
</p>
<p>regarding labor organizations, and their relations to and influence
</p>
<p>upon the compensation to be paid for work, and the efforts to give
</p>
<p>force to this influence by the peaceful withdrawal of employes on
</p>
<p>their organized demands being refused, and by a strike declared. It
</p>
<p>is an imdoubted rule of the common law, that it is criminal to con-
</p>
<p>federate and combine together, by concerted means, to do that
</p>
<p>which is unlawful or criminal, to the injury of the public, or parties
</p>
<p>or classes of the community, or even to the right of an individual.
</p>
<p>But because a combination of workingmen to raise their wages was
</p>
<p>deemed in the middle of the fourteenth century unlawful, as prov-
</p>
<p>ing itself to result injuriously to classes of the community in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, it does not follow that it will be ecpially unlawful here,
</p>
<p>where we have no class legislation, and where our free institutions
</p>
<p>invite all, who as citizens stand on a common level  to unite aud
</p>
<p>associate themselves together for the purpose of bettering their
</p>
<p>condition in every respect, moral, social or financial : where the
</p>
<p>highest purpose of self government is to develop and elevate man-
</p>
<p>hood and free it from all trammels of tradition, drawing the line
</p>
<p>only where freedom is overpowered by license.
</p>
<p>Indeed the common law precedents, decisions and statutes from
</p>
<p>the middle of the fourteenth century until 1S.59, and the succeeding
</p>
<p>changes in 38 and 39 Victoria, chap. 86, passed in 1879, must be

<p>'Considered in relation to tlie then existino- condition of society
</p>
<p>and its demands. Tlie principle of tlie common law was then, as
</p>
<p>now, that conspiracy consisted in a combination to do a wrongful
</p>
<p>or unlawful act to the injury of the public or a portion thereof,
</p>
<p>but what constituted an unlawful act to the injury of the public,
</p>
<p>then, as now, depended upon social conditions and relations. It
</p>
<p>would be unreasonable indeed to insist that we must accept such
</p>
<p>precedents as "applicable to our local situation and circumstances,"
</p>
<p>when in England, with advancing civilization, and the growing
</p>
<p>recognition of popular rights, legislation has from time to time
</p>
<p>liberalized the practice there. All the laws of the parent country,
</p>
<p>whether rules of the common law as illustrated in practice, or
</p>
<p>early English statutes, which were made for the purpose of regu-
</p>
<p>lating the wages of laborers, the settlement of paupers, and mak-
</p>
<p>ing it penal for anyone to use a trade or handicraft to which he
</p>
<p>had not served a full apprenticeship  not being adapted to the
</p>
<p>circumstances of our colonial condition, which recognized the
</p>
<p>equal rights of all as fully before as after the Declaration of Inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, were not adopted, used or approved, and therefore do
</p>
<p>not come within the description of the laws adopted and confirmed
</p>
<p>by the constitutions of the various states.'
</p>
<p>In determining, therefore, what the~common law of this country
</p>
<p>is, as to organizations of workingmen and organizations of em-
</p>
<p>ployers, whose result is to influence compensation to be paid for
</p>
<p>labor, we have simply to assume primarily, that all and each of
</p>
<p>such organizations for mutual benefit and advancement are law-
</p>
<p>ful, and that all means used to promote their objects are lawful,
</p>
<p>until it is show^n that the practical result of the association is, tak-
</p>
<p>ing the good and evil together, injurious to the public or the par-
</p>
<p>ties, or to portions of the community, or to the rights of the
</p>
<p>individual. It is simply a question of fact, which cannot be
</p>
<p>determined by English precedents made under different condi-
</p>
<p>tions. As evidence upon this question of fact, the express legis-

</p>
<p>onr own, is of great value, and in the absence of direct legislation
</p>
<p>in any State upon the entire subject may, perhaps, be accepted as
</p>
<p>a fair statement of existing American common law on this sub-
</p>
<p>ject. The aim of such legislation has been to mark the point
</p>
<p>where combined action on the part of those employing labor, or
</p>
<p>by those employed, became unlawful, because the evil resulting
</p>
<p>therefrom to the public, or to portions of the community, or to
</p>
<p>individuals, exceeded whatever of individual or collective good
</p>
<p>might result to the combiners. The continued increase of such
</p>
<p>legislation has afforded evidence of its success as a statutory ex-
</p>
<p>pression of the common law, as applicable to our circumstances
</p>
<p>and conditions.
</p>
<p>This view is given practical expression in State v. Steioart
</p>
<p>4 New Eng. Eep. 378, 59 Vt. 273, where it is declared that
</p>
<p>in England and in this country it is lawful  and it may be added
</p>
<p>commendable  for any body of men to associate themselves to-
</p>
<p>gether for the purpose of bettering their condition, and the very
</p>
<p>genius of free institutions invites them to higher levels and better
</p>
<p>fortunes. They may dictate their own wages, fraternize with
</p>
<p>their own associates, choose their own employers, and serve man
</p>
<p>and mammon according to the dictates of their own conscience.
</p>
<p>It is recognized that all the legislation and course of judicial de-
</p>
<p>cision in England and America has been progressively in the
</p>
<p>direction of according to laborers the enjoyment of equal rights
</p>
<p>with others, and to-day in England and here, workingmen stand
</p>
<p>upon the same broad level of equality before the law with all the
</p>
<p>other vocations, professions or callings whatsoever, respecting the
</p>
<p>disposition of their labor and the advancement of their associated
</p>
<p>interests. Here, as there, it is unlawful for employers to coerce,,
</p>
<p>intimidate or hinder the free choice of workmen in the disposal
</p>
<p>of their time, skill and talents. There, as here, it is unlawful for-
</p>
<p>workmen wrongfully to coerce, intimidate or hinder employers in
</p>
<p>the selection of such workmen as they choose to employ.

</p>
<p>and advertisements, that they were not to hire themselves tO'

</p>
<p>The bill prayed an injunction to restrain the issuing of the pla-

<p>LEGISLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 381
</p>
<p>cards and advertisements, allegincy that by means thereof the
</p>
<p>defendants had in fact intimidated and prevented the workmen
</p>
<p>from hiring themselves to plaintiffs, and plaintiffs were thereby
</p>
<p>prevented from continning their business, and the value of their
</p>
<p>property was seriously injured and materially diminished. Held,
</p>
<p>upon demurrer, that the acts of defendants, as alleged in tlie bill,
</p>
<p>amounted to a crime, and that the court would interfere l)y in-
</p>
<p>junction to restrain such acts, as they also tended to the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion or deterioration of the property.
</p>
<p>In the case of Reg. v. Drvitt, 16 L. T. K S. 855, it was laid
</p>
<p>down as law by Mr. Baron Bramwell, that it was not illegal for
</p>
<p>workmen to combine together to regulate the amount of wages,
</p>
<p>so long as they used no threats or violence to prevent other men
</p>
<p>from hiring themselves.
</p>
<p>In Skinnei' v. Kitch, L. R. 2 Q. B. 393, where a master builder
</p>
<p>received notice from a carpenters' union, that four of his men
</p>
<p>who belonged to the union would be ordered to leave his employ-
</p>
<p>ment unless a fifth workman, also in his employ, became a mem-
</p>
<p>oer of the union, it was decided that the secretary of the union
</p>
<p>was guilty of having by threats endeavored to force the employer
</p>
<p>*'to limit the description of his workmen." A conspiracy to force
</p>
<p>the discharge of certain workmen under threat to quit the employ-
</p>
<p>ment if it is not done, is unlawful.'
</p>
<p>Baron Bramwell in the case of Beg. v. Drnitt, 16 L. T. X. S-
</p>
<p>855, in his direction to the jury said that "every man is at liberty
</p>
<p>to induce others" by persuasion or otherwise, to enter into a com-
</p>
<p>bination to keep up the price of wages or the like; but directly
</p>
<p>he enters into a combination which has, as its object, intimidation
</p>
<p>or violence, interfering with the jDerfect freedom of action of
</p>
<p>another man, it then becomes an offense, not only at common
</p>
<p>law, but also an offense punishable by the express enactment of
</p>
<p>the Act of 6 George lY., chap. 129.

</p>
<p>While the law accords liberty to the one, it accords a like liberty
</p>
<p>to every other one, and all are bound to so use and enjoy their
</p>
<p>own liberties and privileges as not to interfere with those of their
</p>
<p>neighbors. The labor and skill of the workman, the plant of the
</p>
<p>manufacturer, the equipment of the farmer, the learning, skill and
</p>
<p>experience of the professional man, the skilled artisan or artist,
</p>
<p>are in an equal sense property. Every man has the light to
</p>
<p>employ his talents, industry and capital as he pleases, free from
</p>
<p>the dictation of others; and if two or more persons combine to
</p>
<p>coerce his choice in this matter, it is a criminal conspiracy, whether
</p>
<p>the means employed are actual violence or a species of intimida-
</p>
<p>tion which works upon the mind. The law in this country and
</p>
<p>in England forbids an interference with the property rights of
</p>
<p>third persons, or any restraint upon the lawful prosecution of their
</p>
<p>industries, as well as any unlawful control over the free use and
</p>
<p>employment by workmen of their own j^ersonal skill and labor, at
</p>
<p>such times, for such prices, and for such purposes as they please.
</p>
<p>In the first count of the indictment in State v. Stewart^ 4 New
</p>
<p>Eng. Rep. 378, 59 Vt. 273, an unlawful conspiracy and agree-
</p>
<p>ment was charged to prevent, hinder and deter by violence,
</p>
<p>threats and intimidation the Ryegate Granite Works from retahi-
</p>
<p>ing and taking into its employ O'Rourke, Goodfellow and others.
</p>
<p>In the second count, after relating the malicious intent to control,
</p>
<p>injure, terrify and impoverish the Granite Company, the pleader
</p>
<p>charges an unlawful conspiracy and agreement to terrify, frighten,
</p>
<p>intimidate and drive aw^ay by threats and intimidation O'Rourke,
</p>
<p>Goodfellow and others, who were then and there workmen and
</p>
<p>laborers of such company. These counts were held to sufficiently
</p>
<p>charge a conspiracy at common law, by means unlawful under
</p>
<p>the statute. The third and fourth counts set forth more particu-
</p>
<p>larly the methods adopted to interfere with the prosecution of its
</p>
<p>business by the company. They charge the defendants with an
</p>
<p>intent to prevent the prosecution of the work of that company by

<p>threatening O'Rourke, Goodfellow and others, that the Ryegate

<p>"scabs," and their names would be published in the "scab" list in

<p>the Granite Cutters' Journal, and that they should be shunned

<p>and not allowed to work with other granite cutters, and would be

</p>
<p>disgraced in the craft, etc., by all which O'Kourke, Goodfellow
</p>
<p>and others were frightened and driven away from said shop.
</p>
<p>These counts were held sufficient.
</p>
<p>In SiaU v. Glidden, 3 New Eng. Kep. 849, 55 Conn. 46, the
</p>
<p>court sustained an indictment for a conspiracy which charged that
</p>
<p>the defendants conspired to threaten and use means (the boycott)
</p>
<p>to intimidate the Carrington Publishing Company, to compel it
</p>
<p>against its will to abstain from doing an act (to keep in its employ
</p>
<p>workmen of its own choice) which it had a legal right to do, and
</p>
<p>to do an act (employ the defendants and such persons as they
</p>
<p>should name), which it had a legal right to abstain from doing.
</p>
<p>As* charged in the information, the defendants' purpose was to
</p>
<p>deprive the publishing company of its liberty to carry on its busi-
</p>
<p>ness in its own way, although in doing so it interfered with no
</p>
<p>right of the defendants. The motive was to gain an advantage
</p>
<p>unjustly and at the expense of others, and therefore the act was
</p>
<p>legally corrupt. As the means of accomplishing the purpose, the
</p>
<p>parties intended to harm the publishing company, and therefore it
</p>
<p>was malicious.
</p>
<p>" All conspiracies whatsoever, wrongfully to prejudice a third
</p>
<p>person, are highly criminal at common law.'"
</p>
<p>It was held, however, in People v. Petherara^ 1 "West. Rep.
</p>
<p>592, 64 Mich. 252, that such a statute does not require malice to
</p>
<p>be shown against the owner of the business disturbed, or his prop-
</p>
<p>erty, in the same sense as does the common law in cases of mali-
</p>
<p>cious mischief. These statutes, it is said, were passed to prevent
</p>
<p>and punish a course of proceedings for the punishment of which
</p>
<p>the common law furnished no precedents, as they are of compara-
</p>
<p>tively recent origin. The offense consists in the commission of cer-
</p>
<p>tain acts, or in conspiring to commit the same; and the manner of
</p>
<p>committing them may furnish, if unexplained, a sufficient proof
</p>
<p>of the malice necessary under the statute, to be proven in the
</p>
<p>same way as malice is established in other cases. Thus when a

<p>man commits an act unaccompanied by any circumstances justify-

<p>ing its commission, the law presumes tliat he acted advisedly and
</p>
<p>with an intent to produce the consequences which have ensued.
</p>
<p>After the enactment of the Statute in 1870, it was held in 1886
</p>
<p>that the orderly and peaceable assembling or co-operation of per-
</p>
<p>sons employed in any calling, trade or handicraft, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of obtaining an advance in the rate of wages and compensation, or
</p>
<p>of maintaining such rate, is not a conspiracy. Laboring men may
</p>
<p>lawfully do this, provided they do not extend the purpose or
</p>
<p>result of the combination to prevent other people from working
</p>
<p>at prices to suit themselves.' So also in Pennsylvania.*
</p>
<p>Employes may stop working, if their employer unjustly refuses
</p>
<p>to accede to their just demands. They may do their utmost, "by
</p>
<p>speech, writing, suasion, appeal, and in every other lawful way,
</p>
<p>to persuade their fellow workingmen not to fill their places, nor
</p>
<p>to aid their late employer in his unjust stand.' But if others,
</p>
<p>despite their appeals, determine it is their own interest to fill the
</p>
<p>vacant places at the prices ofiiered, it is unlawful and a criminal
</p>
<p>conspiracy for the combination or its agents to coerce them
</p>
<p>by threats, or intimidation, or violence.* That no actual violence
</p>
<p>was used where men, in pursuance of a consj^iracy, congregated
</p>
<p>about the door of a bakery and distributed circulars to passers-by,
</p>
<p>will not relieve the actors from the charge of criminal conspiracy,
</p>
<p>if what they did amounted in effect to intimidation of such passers,
</p>
<p>or of the proprietor of the bakery.* In the Theiss Boycott Cases,
</p>
<p>the distribution of circulars by combined effort in places of busi-
</p>
<p>ness, to intimidate customers or to injure the proprietors, is
</p>
<p>declared punishable as conspiracy.

<p>were copartners in trade, carrying on business in the city of
</p>
<p>New York as cloak manufacturers, by means of a threat made by
</p>
<p>Mm to tliem to do an unlawful injury to their property, that is to
</p>
<p>say, to injure and destroy their business and prevent and hinder
</p>
<p>them from carrying on the same. It appeared by the evidence
</p>
<p>that these two persons were cloak manufacturers, emploj'ing a
</p>
<p>large number of persons in that business, and that in January,
</p>
<p>1891, a strike took place, by which the persons in their own im-
</p>
<p>mediate neighborhood and those employed by contractors with
</p>
<p>them refused to work until a more satisfactory arrangement might
</p>
<p>be made for their compensation. While these persons were on
</p>
<p>their strike the firm employed others to manufacture their gar-
</p>
<p>ments, who were either non-union persons or else engaged in the
</p>
<p>employment in violation of the rules of their union. And efforts
</p>
<p>were made to arrange and agree upon terms which would be sat-
</p>
<p>isfactory to the individuals who were out upon the strike and
</p>
<p>would induce them to resume theii* former employment. And in
</p>
<p>the course of these proceedings the defendant acted on behalf of
</p>
<p>the jDersons who were engaged or combined in the strike. He
</p>
<p>acted as their representative and was the manager of the Cloak-
</p>
<p>maker's Union. With him also were associated other persons as
</p>
<p>a committee, who participated in the negotiations had with the
</p>
<p>members of this firm, Popkin & Marks. A result was reached by
</p>
<p>which a scale of prices was agreed upon and assented to by the
</p>
<p>defendant on or about the Slth of January, 1891. But they
</p>
<p>proved to be unsatisfactory to the individuals engaged in the
</p>
<p>strike, and further negotiations continued to obtain more advan-
</p>
<p>tageous terms by way of compensation for the services of the in-
</p>
<p>dividuals included in the strike. These were finally obtained on
</p>
<p>the 9th of February, 1891, and it was agreed that the former em-
</p>
<p>ployes of the firm should return to their work, provided the firm

<p>had been employed by them.

</p>
<p>sons had not resumed their employment, as that had been arranged
</p>
<p>between them and the members of the firm. And his evidence is
</p>
<p>that the defendant then informed him that the persons who had
</p>
<p>been upon the strike did not return to the employment of the firm
</p>
<p>for the reason that Popkin had not settled with the defendant.
</p>
<p>"What kind of a settlement have I got with you ? I don't owe
</p>
<p>you any money." And then the reply was, "You have got to
</p>
<p>pay me five hundred dollars to have your people back again to
</p>
<p>work. ... If you want to have your people back again to
</p>
<p>work, you have got to pay me that amount of money." "I told
</p>
<p>him I didn't know what for. Finally he said to me, ' I will take
</p>
<p>three hundred dollars.' I told him, 'I wouldn't give you one cent,
</p>
<p>because I don't know what for.' He says, 'If you do not give me
</p>
<p>the three hundred dollars you can't have your people back again
</p>
<p>to work." And when this conclusion was reached and asserted,
</p>
<p>the defendant, together with one of the persons, named Zipkin,
</p>
<p>who was with him, left the store, and shortly afterwards Zipkin
</p>
<p>returned and said something about a settlement for $100. This
</p>
<p>statement was made to Mr. Marks, the other partner. And
</p>
<p>shortly after that the defendant returned to the store with Mr.
</p>
<p>Zipkin and then stated, "I will take $100. I am doing this as a
</p>
<p>favor to Zipkin, and instead of three hundred dollars, if you want
</p>
<p>your people back, I will take one hundred dollars." And there-
</p>
<p>upon a cheek was given to the defendant, subscribed by the firm,
</p>
<p>for the sum of $100, upon which the defendant received the
</p>
<p>money. The witness further testified that he believed at the time
</p>
<p>the check was paid to the defendant that the latter had the power
</p>
<p>to keep his men from returning to their work, and it was in that
</p>
<p>belief that he paid the money. The evidence given by Marks,
</p>
<p>the other partner, was not so full or complete as that obtained
</p>
<p>from the witness Popkin, but it still tended to corroborate the

<p>evidence of the latter. And so did that of the witness Berman,
</p>
<p>who was the book-keeper of the firm. It was also stated that the
</p>
<p>defendant represented himself as having the control of these per-
</p>
<p>sons who previously had been in the service of the firm, and had
</p>
<p>agreed to return to that employment.

</p>
<p>It was said by Barrett, /!, in an opinion pronounced by him for
</p>
<p>the court, reversing the judgment below, that the main question
</p>
<p>in this case is whether the obtaining of money from another, with
</p>
<p>his consent, induced by a threat to injure the business of the in-
</p>
<p>dividual threatened, by persuading his employees to absent them-
</p>
<p>selves from work, is "extortion," as that offense is defined in the
</p>
<p>Penal Code,  552, 553, subd. L. In an opinion pronounced
</p>
<p>by the same judge it was held, in the case of Peojple v. Wilzig,
</p>
<p>A N. Y. Crim. Proc. Pep. 403, that it was extortion to pro-
</p>
<p>cure money by fear induced by the threat to continue a so-
</p>
<p>called "boycott," in which the elements of violence, intimida-
</p>
<p>tion and direct injury to tangible personal property were promi-
</p>
<p>nent and marked features. It was also ruled in those cases that
</p>
<p>the threat to do an unlawful injury to the property of another,
</p>
<p>which is one of the statutory conditions of this oiiense, might be
</p>
<p>predicted of an intimidating attitude on the part of those engaged
</p>
<p>in an overt act without actual violence or direct threat by word
</p>
<p>of mouth. Actual violence was there proved, also actual injury
</p>
<p>to the complainant's furniture, goods and fixtures; and the ques-
</p>
<p>tion whether the threat to continue the "boycott" in the manner
</p>
<p>in which it had been conducted amounted to a threat to continue
</p>
<p>the physical injury to the complainant's furniture, goods and fix-
</p>
<p>tures, was left to the jury.
</p>
<p>In the case at the bar the elements of violence, intimidation
</p>
<p>and physical injury to the tangible property are entirely wanting.
</p>
<p>The threats made were not threats of violence, nor was the atti-
</p>
<p>tude of the defendant or his associates an attitude of pliysical in-
</p>
<p>timidation. The utmost that can be claimed by the prosecution
</p>
<p>is that the defendant, as a leader, exercised sufiicient influence
</p>
<p>over the complainant's employes to keep them from resuming
</p>
<p>their employment until he was paid the sum finally agreed upon.
</p>
<p>He utilized that influence and held it over the complainants to
</p>
<p>accomplish his purpose. The employes, whom he professed to
</p>
<p>represent, were equally free from violence or from an attitude of

</p>
<p>intimidation. Thus the threat, as already stated, was merely that
</p>
<p>the men would not work until the defendant was paid. And it
</p>
<p>is asked, Was that a tlireat to do an unlawful injury to the com-
</p>
<p>plainant's property ? The answer, it is said, must be in the neg-

</p>
<p>ative. It certainly was not a threat to do injury to the material
</p>
<p>or to the other property contained in the complainant's place of
</p>
<p>business. It was therefore, simply a threat to injure his busi-
</p>
<p>ness or estate; in other words, to reduce his gains or to prevent
</p>
<p>his making gains. There can be no doubt that any injury to
</p>
<p>one's business is an "injury to property" for the purposes of a
</p>
<p>civil action. Indeed, the Code of Civil Procedure,  3343,
</p>
<p>subd. 10, defines an injury to property as "an actionable act where-
</p>
<p>by the estate of another is lessened." But this definition is
</p>
<p>expressly limited to the construction of the Civil Code,  718.
</p>
<p>It must be supposed that the Legislature thus intended to elimi-
</p>
<p>nate mere actionable acts, whereby the estate of another is less-
</p>
<p>ened, from the domain of criminal offenses, and to limit indictable
</p>
<p>wrongs to injuries done to personal property, as such property is
</p>
<p>described in the penal code. Thus a threat unlawfully to injure
</p>
<p>"goods, chattels and effects," or to deface or destroy "money, evi-
</p>
<p>dence of rights in action or written instruments" of a particular
</p>
<p>description, would be a threat to do an unlawful injury to prop-
</p>
<p>erty, and would sufiice to make out a case of extortion. This
</p>
<p>view is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of crimi-
</p>
<p>nal jurisprudence which deals mainly with what is materially evi-
</p>
<p>denced. The opposite view would leave the question of guilt or
</p>
<p>innocence to be decided, not by the act of the accused alone, op-
</p>
<p>erating upon some tangible thing, but by evidence aliunde with
</p>
<p>respect to an intangible condition of affairs.
</p>
<p>If, for instance, property here means "business," then what was
</p>
<p>the threat, and how was it to work an injury to the complainant's
</p>
<p>business ? It was, as we have seen, a threat to keep people from
</p>
<p>working for the complainants. JSTot all people, but the former
</p>
<p>employes of the complainants. Why should that necessarily
</p>
<p>work an injury to their business ? Only by showing the urgent
</p>
<p>present need of workmen, the inability to secure competent per-
</p>
<p>sons to fill the places of the former employes, the actual condi-
</p>
<p>tion of the material required to be manufactured, the extent of

</p>
<p>existing orders for manufactured goods, and a variety of other con-
</p>
<p>siderations going to make up the present status of the business.
</p>
<p>Now, if the complainants could supply the places of the former
</p>
<p>employes with better workmen, at less wages, then the tl .-eat
</p>
<p>LEGISLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 389
</p>
<p>would be to benefit the business, not to injure it. But even if
</p>
<p>the tendency of the act threatened, might be to injure the busi-
</p>
<p>ness, how could that help the matter ? The statute does not deal
</p>
<p>\vith tendencies or probabilities, much less possibilities. The
</p>
<p>threat must be to do an unlawful injury to property ; not to do
</p>
<p>something which may affect it injuriously, but which must
</p>
<p>injure it.
</p>
<p>If the prosecution is right, the statute would operate upon
</p>
<p>" good will " as well as upon reduced profits ; in fact, up**! prop-
</p>
<p>erty invisible and non-objective, the very existence of which would
</p>
<p>have to be brought to light by independent evidence. The cor-
</p>
<p>pus delicti is, first, the obtaining of the property, and second, the
</p>
<p>threat to injure some specific thing by a direct physical attack
</p>
<p>upon the object of the threat. Property and person are placed
</p>
<p>in the same category, and the property contemplated is something
</p>
<p>that can be injured in the same way as the " person " can be
</p>
<p>injured.
</p>
<p>This injury, whether to person or property, it is said, must be
</p>
<p>surely direct. The prosecution, for example, cannot say that,
</p>
<p>although there was no threat to molest the complainant physically
</p>
<p>or even to touch his person, yet the menace, if executed, might
</p>
<p>have affected his nerves and thus injured his person. Considera-
</p>
<p>tion of the law as it existed prior to the penal code adds force to
</p>
<p>this construction. At common law, extortion signified any oppres-
</p>
<p>sion by color of right ; but, technically, it was defined to be the
</p>
<p>taking of money by an officer by reason of his office, where none
</p>
<p>at all was due, or not so much due, or when it was not yet
</p>
<p>due.'
</p>
<p>These rules as to the taking of unlawful fees we codified in the
</p>
<p>Revised Statutes.^ And we also find there a provision making a
</p>
<p>verbal or written threat to accuse another of any offense, with
</p>
<p>intent to extort property or money, a misdemeanor.* The obtain-
</p>
<p>ing of money by force or fear does not, therefore, seem to have
</p>
<p>been extortion either at common law or under the Revised Stat-

</p>
<p>utes. It was robbery at common law to extort money under the
</p>
<p>threat of charging one with an unnatural crime.'
</p>
<p>And this view was taken of the provision of the Revised Stat-
</p>
<p>utes defining robbery in the second degree, in People v. Mc-
</p>
<p>DanielSj 1 Park. Cr. 198, notwithstanding the specific legislation
</p>
<p>before referred to, making the tlireat of such an accusation, with
</p>
<p>intent to extort money, a misdemeanor. Under the Revised
</p>
<p>Statutes the sending of a letter threatening to accuse any person
</p>
<p>of anj^rime, or to do any injury to the person or property of any
</p>
<p>one, with the view or intent to extort any, etc., was declared to
</p>
<p>be an attfempt to rob. And the fact that this offense was placed
</p>
<p>in the same class as that of robbery was emphasized in People v.
</p>
<p>Griff en, 2 Barb. 427.
</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the offense now under consideration,
</p>
<p>though classed for the first time in the Penal Code as extortion,
</p>
<p>really completes the legislation against robbery, attempts at rob-
</p>
<p>bery, and cognate offenses. Section 552 of the Penal Code is in the
</p>
<p>alternative, treating extortion by force and fear as one thing, and
</p>
<p>extortion by official action as another. These two methods of
</p>
<p>extortion are separately defined in subsequent sections, but it is
</p>
<p>apparent from the language of the section providing the penalty
</p>
<p>by force or fear ( 554) that the latter is but a supplement,
</p>
<p>under the name of extortion, to robbery in the first, second and
</p>
<p>third degrees. This section (554) provides for such punishment
</p>
<p>only when the money or other property has been extorted by
</p>
<p>force or fear " under circumstances not amounting to robbery ; "
</p>
<p>in other words, when the money or other property has been
</p>
<p>claimed '' with the consent " of the complainant and not " against
</p>
<p>his will." For really the main distinction between robbery in
</p>
<p>some degree and this form of extortion lies just there. Robbery
</p>
<p>is the unlawful taking against the will by means of force or vio-
</p>
<p>lence or fear of injury, immediate or future, to one's person or
</p>
<p>proj)erty, (Penal Code,  224) ; while extortion is the obtaining
</p>
<p>with consent by similar means. Thus unless robbery could be

</p>
<p>really been taken against tlieir will), it is difficult to see how
</p>
<p>extortion can be sustained in a case where it was taken with his
</p>
<p>consent. It certainly would be a novel indictment for robbery
</p>
<p>which charged the taking the property against the will of the
</p>
<p>complainant by means of fear of injury to his property, e. g., his
</p>
<p>business, resulting from threats on the part of the robber or high,
</p>
<p>way-man, that he would use his influence with the complainant's
</p>
<p>landlord not to extend his lease, or with the manufacturer not to
</p>
<p>sell him goods, or with the banks not to discount his paper.
</p>
<p>But another difficulty is pointed out, which exists in the case
</p>
<p>under consideration, and that is that the injury threatened must
</p>
<p>in itself be "unlawful." Now, the abstention of work on the
</p>
<p>part of the operatives was not unlawful. It is not claimed that
</p>
<p>they broke any contract of service or hiring, knowing or having
</p>
<p>reasonable cause to believe that the probable consequence of so
</p>
<p>doing would be to endanger human life or to cause grievous bodi-
</p>
<p>ly injury or to expose valuable property to destruction or serious
</p>
<p>injury. Penal Code,  673. It is not, in fact, pretended that
</p>
<p>these ojDeratives were working for the complainants under any
</p>
<p>special contract at all. On the other hand they were not guilty
</p>
<p>of " conspiracy," for the reason that orderly and peaceable co-
</p>
<p>operation for the purpose of obtaining an advance in the rate of
</p>
<p>wages is expressly excepted from the conspiracy sections. Penal
</p>
<p>Code,  170. This exception was further emphasized by an
</p>
<p>amendment to  675 of the Penal Code, which went into eifect
</p>
<p>on the 1st of September, in the present year, and which reads as
</p>
<p>follows : " But nothing in this Code contained shall be so con-
</p>
<p>strued as to prevent any person from demanding an increase of
</p>
<p>wages or from assembhng and using all lawful means to induce
</p>
<p>employers to pay such wages to all persons employed by them as
</p>
<p>shall be a just and fair compensation for services rendered."
</p>
<p>Thus, the opinion declares, the law is unmistakable that so long
</p>
<p>as there is neither violence nor an attitude of intimidation nor
</p>
<p>interference with others, employes are free to work or to refrain

<p>from working, as they please ; free individually and free in com-
</p>
<p>bination. The attitude of the complainant's employes, at the
</p>
<p>time the threat in question was made, was not, therefore, unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful. It would seem to follow that a threat to induce a continu-
</p>
<p>392 CONSPIRACY AT COMMON LAW  CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>ance of their lawful attitude could not of itself be unlawful, at
</p>
<p>least in tlie sense of criminal. "Whether a civil action would lie
</p>
<p>for damages sustained by the defendant's acts is a question not
</p>
<p>involved in the decision. It is sufficient in the judgment of the
</p>
<p>court, for the determination of the case, that the defendant's
</p>
<p>threat to use his influence to keep men from working for the
</p>
<p>complainants, however wrong morally, was not criminal. It was
</p>
<p>not a threat to do the complainants an unlawful injury, but to
</p>
<p>continue a condition of things which, even if injurious, was
</p>
<p>undoubtedly lawful. The act threatened, that is, the act of
</p>
<p>advising, persuading or exhorting the men not to resume work, was
</p>
<p>not in itself indictable, and was not in itself more unlawful than the
</p>
<p>act of the men in abstaining from work. The statutory crime
</p>
<p>does not consist of a threat to do an improper or unjust act, nor
</p>
<p>to do an unlawful injury to the property of another. Whatever
</p>
<p>injury was being done to the complainant's business at the time
</p>
<p>of the threat in question was not an unlawful injury. And it
</p>
<p>follows that the defendant cannot be said to have threatened to
</p>
<p>do an unlawful injury to such business.
</p>
<p>It was for these reasons that the judgment and conviction were
</p>
<p>reversed, and a new trial ordered.
</p>
<p>There was also tiled by Ingraham, /!, an opinion concurring in
</p>
<p>the reversal. He stated that the crime of extortion is defined by sec-
</p>
<p>tion 552 of the Code to be the obtaining of property from another
</p>
<p>with his consent, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or
</p>
<p>under color of official right, and the defendant claimed on the
</p>
<p>trial that he is not guilty of extortion as defined by this Act, and
</p>
<p>that conceding the testimony offered on behalf of the people to
</p>
<p>be true, the crime was not proven.
</p>
<p>By section 553 of the Penal Code it is provided that " fear, such
</p>
<p>as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat to do an
</p>
<p>unlawful injury to the person or property of the individual threat-
</p>
<p>ened, or to any relative of his or to any member of his family,'^
</p>
<p>and therefore it is said, that to support this judgment it must

<p>appear that the defendant extorted from the firm of Popkin &
</p>
<p>Marks the $100 mentioned in the indictment by the wrongful use
</p>
<p>of fear induced by a threat to do an unlawful injury to the prop-
</p>
<p>erty of such firm.
</p>
<p>LEGISLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 393
</p>
<p>The conclnsion is reached from an analysis of section 553 that the
</p>
<p>threat to induce fear as defined by the section must contain two
</p>
<p>elements : first, the threat must be to do what is unlawful ; and
</p>
<p>second, the injury must be an injury to the property or person of
</p>
<p>the individual threatened, or to a relative of his or to a member
</p>
<p>of his family ; and unless it appears that what the person threat-
</p>
<p>ened to do was unlawful, and, if performed, would do an injury
</p>
<p>to the person or property of the person threatened, the party
</p>
<p>making is not guilty of the crime.
</p>
<p>In construing the section of a code the rule is recognized, that
</p>
<p>we should give a reasonable constniction to the language used,
</p>
<p>not a forced and unnatural construction, extending the meaning
</p>
<p>of the words so as to include threats which a person of ordinary
</p>
<p>intelligence would not understand to be within the fair meaning
</p>
<p>of the language.
</p>
<p>Popkin & Marks were coat manufacturers in the city of ISTew
</p>
<p>York. Their employes had left work in consequence of a dispute
</p>
<p>between themselves and the firm as to wages, and on the 9th of
</p>
<p>February an agreement was arrived at between the firm and their
</p>
<p>employes whereby tlie employes agreed to return to work on
</p>
<p>the following morning.
</p>
<p>On that morning, however, they did not return to work, but
</p>
<p>the defendant came to the ofiice of the firm accompanied by sev-
</p>
<p>eral of the firm's employes and at that time he demanded the
</p>
<p>sum of $500, saying to Mr. Popkin : " You have got to pay me
</p>
<p>S500 to have your people back again to work." Upon the refusal
</p>
<p>of Popkin to pay any sum, he reduced his demand to $300, say-
</p>
<p>ing : " If you do not give me 300 you cannot have your people
</p>
<p>back again to work ; I will take $300 as long as I am here, and
</p>
<p>as quick as I am going to leave this place it will cost you
</p>
<p>$500."
</p>
<p>That demand was refused and defendant left his place. In a
</p>
<p>few minutes Zipkin, one of his companions, returned and after
</p>
<p>some consultation with Marks, one of the members of the firm,

<p>Marks said he would pay the defendant $100. Zipkin left and
</p>
<p>in a short time returned with the defendant, who then said : "I
</p>
<p>will take $100; I am doing that as a favor to Zipkin and instead
</p>
<p>of $300, if you want your people back I will take $100."

<p>A check was then drawn by the firm to the order of the de-

<p>account of the firm the sum of $100, and this is the only evidence
</p>
<p>of any threat made by the defendant to Popkin & Marks, or to
</p>
<p>anyone.
</p>
<p>Upon this statement of facts it seems clear, it is said, that there
</p>
<p>was no threat to do an unlawful injury to property. The defend-
</p>
<p>ant did not expressly threaten Popkin & Marks that he would do
</p>
<p>anything himself; there was no statement that he would prevent
</p>
<p>the men from working; what he said was that they would not re-
</p>
<p>turn to work. It was certainly not unlawful for these men to
</p>
<p>refuse to work for Popkin & Marks, nor was it unlawful for de-
</p>
<p>fendant to advise them not to work. There was no threat, there-
</p>
<p>fore, in the opinion of the judge, to do an unlawful act. Defend-
</p>
<p>ant did not of his accord go to the place of business of Popkin
</p>
<p>& Marks, but was sent for by them, and his statement that the
</p>
<p>men would not return to work, even if that could be construed
</p>
<p>into a threat that he would prevent them from returning to work,
</p>
<p>was not a threat to do an unlawful injury to the property of
</p>
<p>Popkin & Marks, because of the fact that unless the men did
</p>
<p>return Popkin & Marks could not advantageously continue their
</p>
<p>business.
</p>
<p>If one of Popkin & Marks' employes had refused to work for
</p>
<p>them, such a refusal, although it might have seriously affected
</p>
<p>their business, might have caused them serious loss, would not
</p>
<p>have been, it is said, an unlawful injury to their business, because
</p>
<p>an employe had the legal right to work for Popkin & Marks or
</p>
<p>not as he pleased, and if it was not unlawful for an employe to
</p>
<p>refuse to work it was not unlawful for a third party to advise or
</p>
<p>induce him to refuse to work, so that a threat of such third party
</p>
<p>that he would prevent such employe from working would
</p>
<p>not be a threat to do an unlawful injury to the employer's busi-
</p>
<p>ness.
</p>
<p>It is suggested that many illustrations might be given of in-

<p>stances where the exercise of a legal right by one person would
</p>
<p>cause an injury to the property of another, and where there is no
</p>
<p>penalty for liability because of the exercise of such right. Thus
</p>
<p>the owner of a dwelling-house could devote it to business pur-

<p>LEaiSLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 395
</p>
<p>popes and thereby injure the value of adjoining property. Yet
</p>
<p>such use would not be an unlawful injury to the adjoining prop-
</p>
<p>erty, and a threat by the owner to make such use of his property
</p>
<p>would not be a threat to do an "unlawful injury" to property.
</p>
<p>It might be said to be a threat to do a "lawful injury" to the ad-
</p>
<p>joining house, but such a threat is not sufficient to sustain a con-
</p>
<p>viction for extortion, and it is equally clear that, a threat to induce
</p>
<p>the owner thereof to so use his house is not a threat to unlawfully
</p>
<p>injure property, because if it is not unlawful for the owner to use
</p>
<p>it for a particular use, it is not unlawful for a person to procure
</p>
<p>the owner so to use it. Nor can such a threat be said to be a
</p>
<p>threat to do an injury to the property.
</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the defendant had any knowledge
</p>
<p>that Fopkin & Marks had any unmanufactured goods on hand at
</p>
<p>the time of the occasion in controversy, or that he knew, or had
</p>
<p>reason to know, that the refusal of the men to return to work
</p>
<p>would cause injury to any of their property.
</p>
<p>Poj)kin & Marks had a right to employ such men as they chose,
</p>
<p>and their employes had a right to work for whom they chose,
</p>
<p>and the mere supposition that the refusal of this particular body
</p>
<p>of men to work for Popkin & Marks would in some way embar-
</p>
<p>rass them in manufacturing goods for their fall trade, is "all that
</p>
<p>there is to sustain the charge that this was a threat to injure prop-
</p>
<p>erty.
</p>
<p>But it is said to be clear, that the evident intent of the statute
</p>
<p>is that the threat should be to injure a specific piece of prop-
</p>
<p>erty.
</p>
<p>There must be the existence of a res and a threat to in-
</p>
<p>jure it.
</p>
<p>The section in question is part of chapter 5 of title 15 of the
</p>
<p>Penal Code. The title treats of crimes against property and in-
</p>
<p>cludes arson, burglary and house breaking, forgery and counter-
</p>
<p>feiting, larceny, embezzlement and extortion. The word " prop-
</p>

<p>man's business, and there could not certainly be an indictment for
</p>
<p>larceny for stealing the business.
</p>
<p>The meaning of a threat to do an unlawful injury to the per-
</p>
<p>son of an individual would be a threat to, in some way, injure his
</p>
<p>396 CONSPIRACY AT COMMON LAW CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>body, and the threat to do an unlawful mjury to his property^
</p>
<p>applying the words in their ordinary significance would be in
</p>
<p>some way to injure some specific property.
</p>
<p>It could hardly be claimed that a threat to injure a person's
</p>
<p>character, or his professional reputation would be an injury to
</p>
<p>property within the meaning of this act; and yet, such a threat,
</p>
<p>where the successful conduct of such person's business depended
</p>
<p>largely upon his character and reputation, might seriously injure
</p>
<p>his business.
</p>
<p>It is a threat to injure the thing that constitutes the crime; not
</p>
<p>to do an act which indirectly may do damage to business or its
</p>
<p>successful conduct.
</p>
<p>The conclusion therefore which Judge Ingraham also reaches,,
</p>
<p>is, that the evidence was not sufiicient to sustain the convic-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Whether under like legislation, other courts will probably reach
</p>
<p>the same results, may be perhaps reasonably conjectured on com-
</p>
<p>paring the reasons assigned by Daniels, ./., for advising an affirm-
</p>
<p>ance of the judgment. He states these reasons substantially, aa
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>At the close of the case on the part of the people, a motion was
</p>
<p>made for the acquittal of the defendant, which was denied, and
</p>
<p>the counsel for the defendant excepted to that denial. This mo-
</p>
<p>tion evidently proceeded upon the theory that the threat which
</p>
<p>the jury could very well imply or infer from what is stated to
</p>
<p>have taken place was not such a threat as the law required to
</p>
<p>create the offense of extortion. And that position has been taken
</p>
<p>in support of the present appeal from the judgment. Whether
</p>
<p>the evidence was sufficient to place the case within the provisions-
</p>
<p>of the law relative to this offense must depend upon the construc-
</p>
<p>tion which should be given to the statute enacted to define and
</p>
<p>punish the crime of extortion. It has been declared by  552 of
</p>
<p>the Penal Code of the State that "extortion is the obtaining of
</p>
<p>property from another with his consent, induced by a wrongful

</p>
<p>use of force, or fear, or under color of official right." And by
</p>
<p> 553 of the same code, it has been declared that: "Fear, such
</p>
<p>as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat to do an
</p>
<p>LEGISLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 397
</p>
<p>unlawful injury to the person, or property of the individual
</p>
<p>threatened, or to any relative of his, or to any member of his
</p>
<p>family." Assuming the evidence of the witness Popkin to be
</p>
<p>reliable, as that may properly be done inasmuch as the jury ap-
</p>
<p>pears to have accepted it as truthful, the point is presented
</p>
<p>whether a threat to prevent the persons who had been upon the
</p>
<p>strike from returning to and entering the employment of the firm
</p>
<p>was a threat to do an unlawful injury to the property of this firm.
</p>
<p>It is stated in the evidence of the witness first sworn, that they
</p>
<p>liad on hand material cut up and ready for manufacturing, and
</p>
<p>not manufactured, and that what was cut and uncut amounted to
</p>
<p>the sum of about $50,000, and that was designed to be manufac-
</p>
<p>tured by the firm in the course of its business. It was also stated
</p>
<p>that the season for the sale of their manufactured garments closed
</p>
<p>about the 15th of April. The firm at the time had become, by
</p>
<p>the discharge of the persons who had been employed by it, inca-
</p>
<p>pable of proceeding with the manufacture of these garments, and
</p>
<p>had placed itself and the business carried on by it in a state of
</p>
<p>entire dependence upon the individuals who had been engaged
</p>
<p>in the strike. And the effect of what is stated to have been said
</p>
<p>by one of its members by the defendant was that this business
</p>
<p>should be interrupted and necessarily remain in suspense until
</p>
<p>the money which was demanded should be paid over.
</p>
<p>The defendant, according to the testimony of Mr. Popkin, as-
</p>
<p>serted himself to be in such a relation to the persons on this strike,
</p>
<p>even after they had adjusted their difference as to a compensation,
</p>
<p>as to control their movements and prevent them from returning
</p>
<p>into the service of the firm, unless his demand was satisfied. By
</p>
<p>this interposition of his authority over the working people the
</p>
<p>belief is stated to have been produced that the persons would not
</p>
<p>return to their employment until this money was paid to the de-
</p>
<p>fendant. And in the opinion of the judge writing the dissent
</p>
<p>that of itself was a threat on his part to injure the property or
</p>
<p>business of the firm, for the interruption of the business would

</p>
<p>necessarily be attended with loss to the firm. And a loss result-
</p>
<p>ing from the suspension or interruption of the business would
</p>
<p>necessarily be an injury to property, and it was to avoid that in-
</p>
<p>jury that this money was paid over.
</p>
<p>398 CONSPIRACY AT COMMON LAW  CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>It is not thought that the statute requires the narrow construc-
</p>
<p>tion insisted upon by the defendant's counsel. For it has not
</p>
<p>been, either by its language or reasonable import confined to the
</p>
<p>case of an actual injury to some specific article of property, but it
</p>
<p>has been made to include the threat to do any unlawful injury to
</p>
<p>property. And business is property, as much so as the articles
</p>
<p>themselves which are included in its transactions. Besides that
</p>
<p>this term "property" has been so defined by subds. 9, 14r and 15
</p>
<p>of  718, of the Penal Code, as to include the business itself and the
</p>
<p>loss resulting from its interruption. By the first of these subdivision
</p>
<p>it has been declared that, "the term 'property' includes both real
</p>
<p>and personal property, things in action, money, bank bills, and all
</p>
<p>articles of value." And it has been further declared by subd. 15
</p>
<p>of the same section that the term "personal property" includes
</p>
<p>every description of money, goods, chattels, efliects, evidences of
</p>
<p>rights in action, and all written instruments by which any pecu-
</p>
<p>niary obligation right or title to property, real or personal, is cre-
</p>
<p>ated, acknowledged, transferred, increased, defeated, discharged
</p>
<p>or diminished, and every right and interest therein. And this is
</p>
<p>conformable to the significance given to the same term by legal
</p>
<p>writers. For it has been said by Blackstone that property con-
</p>
<p>sists in the free use, enjoyment and disposal of all the owner's
</p>
<p>acquisitions, without any control or diminution save only by the
</p>
<p>laws of the land. 1 Bl. Com. (Sharswood's ed.) 138.
</p>
<p>And in Springfield F. & M. Ins. Co. v. Allen, 43 K. T. 395,
</p>
<p>it was stated in the opinion of the court that, " property is a thing
</p>
<p>owned, that to which a person has or may have a legal title.'^
</p>
<p>And in all its attributes it has been brought within the protection
</p>
<p>of the constitution of both the nation and the State by the decla-
</p>
<p>ration that no person shall be deprived of property without due
</p>
<p>process of law. And that includes, in the opinion of the judge,
</p>
<p>within this term, a business which may be built up for the manu-
</p>
<p>facture and sale of property, as well as the tangible articles them-
</p>
<p>selves employed or used in the course of such business. It is said

</p>
<p>there would obviously be no reason for so distinguishing the word
</p>
<p>" property," as it has been used in the sections of the code, as to
</p>
<p>apply it solely to tangible articles capable in and of themselves
</p>
<p>of receiving direct injury by the unlawful or wrongful act of
</p>
<p>LEGISLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 399
</p>
<p>another. The section has not employed the term in that manner,
</p>
<p>but it has inckided it in its broad and unrestricted sense, applying
</p>
<p>its prohibition to whatever may be properly maintained to be
</p>
<p>property. And the business of persons en^^aged in it is certainly,
</p>
<p>within the unrestricted significance of the term as it has been
</p>
<p>employed, as much a matter of property as any of the goods or
</p>
<p>garments sold in the course of such business. And the infer-
</p>
<p>ence is therefore drawn that the defendant was not entitled to the
</p>
<p>direction which was asked for in his favor, for the evidence did
</p>
<p>tend to establish the existence of an offense within the scope of
</p>
<p>this indictment.
</p>
<p>On the trial an exception was also taken to what was stated to
</p>
<p>have been said and done at one of the meetings held by the cloak-
</p>
<p>makers. Mr. Zipkin was the chairman of that meeting, and was
</p>
<p>with the defendant at the office of the firm when the prices were
</p>
<p>fixed. And not only from the evidence given on the part
</p>
<p>of the prosecution, but that also produced in behalf of the
</p>
<p>defendant, it was made to appear that he was their substantial
</p>
<p>representative, and that his services were employed to harmonize
</p>
<p>the differences between the cloak-makers and this firm. And
</p>
<p>both on behalf of the prosecution, as well as the defendant, the
</p>
<p>proceedings of the meetings of the cloak-makers were in order to.
</p>
<p>exhibit theii* intention and state of mind concerning the resump-
</p>
<p>tion of their employment. They were, in fact, as the evidence
</p>
<p>indicated the case to be, co-operating together. They asserted
</p>
<p>their claims, and the defendant endeavored to obtain such conces-
</p>
<p>sions as would satisfy these persons. And there was consequently
</p>
<p>no impropriety in showing what was exacted by them as a subject
</p>
<p>matter falling within the province of the defendant for negotia-
</p>
<p>tion and settlement. There was really no dispute as to the exac-
</p>
<p>tions, or the fact that they co-operated together to secure the con-
</p>
<p>cession of their terms, or the settlement upon others which would
</p>
<p>be satisfactory to them. Both parties were acting to bring about
</p>
<p>this result and to attain it it became necessary to understand what

</p>
<p>the cloak-makers themselves required should be made in the way
</p>
<p>of concessions or advanced compensations for their services. And
</p>
<p>evidence of what took place at their meeting was admissible for
</p>
<p>the purpose of proving what they insisted upon, and what the
</p>
<p>defendant himself endeavored to secure in their behalf.
</p>
<p>400 OONSPIEACY AT COMMON LAW CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>Upon the examination of the defendant as a witness he was
</p>
<p>asked whether he kept the money himself, that sum of 100. An
</p>
<p>exception was taken to the sustaining of an objection to this ques-
</p>
<p>tion. JS^ow the theory of the defense is that the defendant demand-
</p>
<p>ed this money not for himself, but as some compensation for the
</p>
<p>cloak-makers during the time they had been engaged in the strike.
</p>
<p>And the object of the inquiry was probably to show that he had
</p>
<p>paid over the $100 to them, or for their benefit. If no other
</p>
<p>evidence had been given concerning tliis money, it would prob-
</p>
<p>ably have been error to have excluded this answer. But the witness
</p>
<p>himself has previously stated that he went with Mr. Zipkin and
</p>
<p>cashed a check, " and got the money, and went with Mr. Zipkin
</p>
<p>to the office and delivered the money to the cashier." He also
</p>
<p>testified that he stated to Mr. Popkin that he took the money to
</p>
<p>be distributed between the working people of Popkin & Marks ;
</p>
<p>that he obtained it at their request as they had instructed him,
</p>
<p>and did not receive it intending to appropriate any of it to his
</p>
<p>own use. This, with the other evidence, was all that was required
</p>
<p>to be proved to relieve the defendant from this criminal accusa-
</p>
<p>tion if the jury had confided in his statement.
</p>
<p>The defendant was also interrogated as to remarks that he had
</p>
<p>made at a meeting at which he was present as one of the speakers.
</p>
<p>But there was no error in the opinion of the judge in taking his
</p>
<p>answer as to what he had said at the meeting as some evidence
</p>
<p>bearing upon his general intention in the control or management
</p>
<p>of the aft'airs of the unions. He stated generally that he believed
</p>
<p>the working people had a right to unite themselves and form a
</p>
<p>union and ask for justice. He was undoubtedly correct in this
</p>
<p>statement. This subject was very fully examined in Thomas v.
</p>
<p>Mut. Prot. Union, 49 Hun, 171, in which Judge Daniels exam-
</p>
<p>ined the authorities accessible on this subject. And it was there
</p>
<p>concluded that all persons had the right to prescribe the terms
</p>
<p>upon which they would perform their services. And that this
</p>
<p>was not only an individual right, but it was one which could be

</p>
<p>protected by the combination of two or more persons. And it
</p>
<p>was their right to refuse to render their services for any person
</p>
<p>who might be offensive or disagreeable to them, or with any person
</p>
<p>who should not, for any cause, receive their approval ; that so far
</p>
<p>the law permitted all working people to combine together either

</p>
<p>for their individual or their mutual Drotection. It is true that
</p>
<p>these views were not there expressly accepted by the other mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the court, but they are still deemed to be well supported
</p>
<p>by the authorities, and the case in which they were expressed, as
</p>
<p>it was in fact decided, is no authority to the contrary, for the rea-
</p>
<p>son that the decision made by the majority of the court, as well
</p>
<p>as by the special term was afterwards reversed by the Court of
</p>
<p>Appeals.* There was accordingly no infringement of the law in
</p>
<p>what the defendant himself, in the manner, stated he had said,
</p>
<p>nor by what he afterwards conceded to have been his additional
</p>
<p>statement. And no harm, therefore, could have resulted to him
</p>
<p>from what he admitted to have been his remarks at the meeting:.
</p>
<p>The verdict has been objected to as against the weight of the
</p>
<p>evidence. This objection has been raised uj^on the fact that four
</p>
<p>witnesses besides the defendant testified that they were present at
</p>
<p>the time when the money was demanded by him from Mr. Pop-
</p>
<p>kin, and that he demanded the money not for himself, but to dis"
</p>
<p>tribute or divide among the persons who had been out of employ-
</p>
<p>ment during the period of the strike. Further evidence was
</p>
<p>given by two witnesses sworn on behalf of the defendant as to
</p>
<p>statements made by Mr. Popkin, but there was no extortion in
</p>
<p>obtaining the money. This, however, was denied by Popkin, and
</p>
<p>in eifect also by his wife, who was present at one of the conversa-
</p>
<p>tions. Further testmiony was also given to prove that the defend-
</p>
<p>ant had a good reputation among those who knew and had busi-
</p>
<p>ness intercourse with him. And from the proof as it apjjears by
</p>
<p>the case, there was certainly sufficient, if the jury had credited
</p>
<p>the statements of the witnesses, to secure the defendant's acquit-
</p>
<p>tal. But this court, not having the advantage of seeing the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses and listening to the statements and observing their manner
</p>
<p>as the jury did, cannot, on that account, assume that the verdict
</p>
<p>was not in accordance with the evidence. It will often occur that
</p>
<p>witnesses may unite in their evidence, as those did so on the part
</p>
<p>of the defendant when the jury, from their conduct or appearance

</p>
<p>upon the stand, will fail to be impressed with the truthfulness of
</p>
<p>their statements. And the court, upon an appeal, where the evi-

<p>the jury have erred as long as they had sufficient evidence before
</p>
<p>them on the part of the prosecution to justify their verdict.
</p>
<p>On this subject it has been said, that " when there is evidence
</p>
<p>on both sides and the case is balanced and the mind of the court
</p>
<p>has been called upon to waive conflicting statements and infer-
</p>
<p>ences, and decide upon the credibility of opposing witnesses, much

<p>weight must be accorded to the special adaption of the trial court

<p>to investigate and determine such questions. Any other rule

<p>would nullify the peculiar advantages which that tribunal pos-

<p>Baird v. New York, 96 N. Y. 567, 577. And this principle
</p>
<p>requires the conclusion of the jury as it has been expressed by
</p>
<p>their verdict to be adopted and maintained by the court, unless
</p>
<p>the preponderance of evidence is so great as to indicate either a
</p>
<p>misunderstanding of the case, or the influence of jjrejudice, passion
</p>
<p>or corruption. Present cannot be held to be of that description.
</p>
<p>It was, in the opinion of Judge Daniels, entirely proper for the
</p>
<p>consideration and decision of the jury, and their verdict can not
</p>
<p>be set aside as opposed to the weight of the evidence. The judg-
</p>
<p>ment, on the contrary, is fully supported by the case as it was pre-
</p>
<p>sented on the part of the ]3rosecution, notwithstanding the evi-

<p>dence produced in favor of the defendant, and it should be

<p>In the fall of 1885 a general strike among the coal miners was
</p>
<p>inaugurated along the valley of the Monongahela River, and a
</p>
<p>number of miners working for Neel and other coal operators
</p>
<p>refused or failed to go out with the other miners upon the strike
</p>
<p>and continued to work for their employers. The effect was that
</p>
<p>the strike was a partial failure. It was then determined to make
</p>
<p>an effort to get these workers to join the strike, and a meeting of
</p>
<p>miners was held in Monongahela City and a vigilance committee

</p>
<p>was appointed to accomplish this, and public meetings were held
</p>
<p>in California and Coal Centre in November, at which resolutions
</p>
<p>were adopted favoring peaceful means and measures, and inviting
</p>
<p>the miners in the lower pools  the flrst, second and third pools 
</p>
<p>to come up into the fourth pool, and assist them in inducing these
</p>
<p>LEGISLATION AFFECTING COMMON LAW. 403
</p>
<p>workers to come out and join the strike. As a result, on the 25th
</p>
<p>and 27th days of November, a steamboat called "The Stella" came
</p>
<p>up the river and landed at Luceyville, or Roscoe, near the mines.
</p>
<p>Quite a number of men, some two hundred, from the lower pools,
</p>
<p>were brought to the fourth pool on this boat. During the time
</p>
<p>the boat remained at these points there was some violence used
</p>
<p>and several men were beaten, and some of the unoccupied shanties
</p>
<p>belonging to Neel were stoned and broken in. The parties who
</p>
<p>engaged in these acts of violence were convicted of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>On the trial the jury were told that if they believed from the evi-
</p>
<p>dence that large bodies of men were collected about the coal
</p>
<p>works of Neel and other coal operators, named in the indictment,
</p>
<p>by previous arrangement or concerted action, with the intention
</p>
<p>of intimidating the miners working, by the presence of great
</p>
<p>numbers of persons oi:posed to the course pursued by said work-
</p>
<p>ing miners, such combination would be unlawful, and all persons-
</p>
<p>engaged therein would be guilty of conspiracy, whether actually
</p>
<p>present at the connnission of any act of violence or not. This
</p>
<p>charge was given, after proof that the means to be used by the
</p>
<p>committee, as it appeared from the resolutions passed, were of a
</p>
<p>peaceful and lawful character, and under no circumstances did the
</p>
<p>convention or tlie committee it appointed countenance the use of
</p>
<p>force or other unlawful means or methods to accomplish the end
</p>
<p>in view. These instructions were affirmed on appeal.'
</p>
<p>So in a civil action in 1887 in Michigan for damages against a
</p>
<p>defendant who was the acknowledged leader of a gang of men
</p>
<p>and who knew its character and intent when he led it upon the
</p>
<p>premises of the plain tiif, for the purpose of inducing the plaintiffs
</p>
<p>employes to join the men already gathered in a strike for ten
</p>
<p>hours, he was held responsible for the acts of violence of the mob not-
</p>
<p>withstanding he halted them 200 feet from the plaintilf s' mill and
</p>
<p>told them to remain there until he came back. It was said that
</p>
<p>whatever right the defendant had to influence the men to quit
</p>
<p>work unless the 10-hour demand w^as acceded to by their employer,

</p>
<p>to enter places of business, that license is nevertheless considered

<p>men to quit in a body and afterwards declared a boycott on its
</p>
<p>business, to compel it to pay the wages demanded by them, were
</p>
<p>held guilty of illegal and actionable acts and were liable to arrest.'
</p>
<p>It was declared that all combinations and associations designed to
</p>
<p>coerce workmen to become members, or to interfere with, obstruct,
</p>
<p>vex or annoy them in working or in obtaining work, because they

<p>Associations of men may endeavor peaceably, and in a reason-
</p>
<p>able manner, to persuade others to cease or abstain from work;
</p>
<p>but if by force or intimidation they endeavor to control the free
</p>
<p>agency or overcome the free will of their fellow workmen, they
</p>
<p>become guilty of a penal offense.' The law encourages combina-
</p>
<p>tions for good, and combinations of workmen to better their con-
</p>
<p>dition by legitimate and fair means are commendable and should
</p>
<p>be encouraged. But combinations for evil purposes, whether by
</p>
<p>one class of men or another, are detrimental to the public weal,
</p>
<p>and cannot be regarded with favor by the courts.'
</p>
<p>In Com. V. Sheriff, 15 Phila, 393, the court held it not unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful to notify employers that a trade union association had decided
</p>
<p>upon an increase of wages to journeyman printers, and unless such
</p>
<p>increase was paid a strike would be declared. The increase being
</p>
<p>refused a strike was declared, and the court excused the invasion
</p>
<p>of the employers' premises to induce the workmen to strike, on
</p>
<p>the ground that it was a place of business and the employers did
</p>
<p>not expressly forbid it, and that the foreman, a member of the
</p>
<p>trade union, was present, and as far as he represented his em-
</p>
<p>ployer might be held to consent. In that case only peaceful
</p>
<p>means were used. But the ruling can hardly be sustained, on
</p>
<p>legal principles, for the law will not imply authority to enter
</p>
<p>premises, open to the public for purposes of business only, where
</p>
<p>the object of the person who enters is to injure the business of
</p>
<p>the proprietor.^ Even in a railway station the implied right of
</p>
<p>entry is limited to those having business with the railroad com-
</p>
<p>pany, and it must be exercised consistently with the interests of
</p>
<p>the railroad, and a traveler can only enter a reasonable time prior
</p>
<p>to the departure of his train."

<p>of the manufacturer, the experience and equipment of the farmer,
</p>
<p>and the learning and reputation of the professional and expert,
</p>
<p>are in equal sense property. The possessors of such property,

<p>extend competition among workmen, by admitting apprentices to
</p>
<p>learn trades.* They may use arguments and persuasion to induce
</p>
<p>others to unite in such combination.
</p>
<p>Even "picketing," which means watching and speaking to the
</p>
<p>workmen, as they go to or return from their employment, to in-
</p>
<p>duce them to leave the service, is not necessarily unlawful ; nor is
</p>
<p>it unlawful to use terms of persuasion towards them to accom-
</p>
<p>plish that object, but if the besetting and watching is carried to
</p>
<p>such an extent that it occasions a dread of loss, it is unlawful.'
</p>
<p>Men may assemble for a lawful purpose, to discuss questions
</p>
<p>for any lawful purpose ; l)ut no man or body of men can law-
</p>
<p>fully go upon the premises of an employer and seek to induce
</p>
<p>the employes to cease work. The very show of numbers, unac-
</p>
<p>companied by actual or threatened violence is, in many cases,
</p>
<p>under existing circumstances, intimidation. The courts will, in
</p>
<p>such case, interpose by injunction against those attempting such

<p>interference, for the remedy by action of trespass is not sutRcient

<p>clear deduction of the cases, and breathe the spirit of equality and
</p>
<p>justice.
</p>
<p>The principle upon which the cases, English and Anierican,^
</p>
<p>proceed, is that every man has the right to enijjloy his talents,
</p>
<p>industry, and capital as he pleases, free from the dictation of
</p>
<p>others ; and if two or more persons combine to coerce his choice
</p>
<p>in this behalf, it is a criminal conspiracy. The labor and skill of
</p>
<p>the workman, or the professional man, be it of high or low
</p>
<p>degree, the plant of the manufacturer, the ecpiipment of the-
</p>
<p>farmer, the investments of commerce, are all, in equal sense,
</p>
<p>property. If men by overt acts of violence destroy either, they
</p>
<p>are guilty of crime. The anathemas of a secret organization of
</p>
<p>men combined for the purpose of controlling the industry of
</p>
<p>others by a species of intimidation that works upon the mind,
</p>
<p>rather than the body, are quite as dangerous, and generally alto-
</p>
<p>gether more effective than acts of actual violence. And while
</p>
<p>such conspiracies may give to the individual directly affected by
</p>
<p>them a private right of action for damages, they at the same time
</p>
<p>lay a basis for an indictment, on the ground that the State itself
</p>
<p>is directly concerned in the promotion of all legitimate industries
</p>
<p>and the development of all its resources, and owes the duty of
</p>
<p>protection to its citizens engaged in the exercise of their callings.
</p>
<p>The good order, peace, and general prosperity of the State are
</p>
<p>directly involved in the question.

</p>
<p>that observing men cannot deny, but the remedy cannot be found
</p>
<p>in secret conspiracies nor in the boycott.'
</p>
<p>Indeed the essential and criminal idea of " boycotting " is a con-
</p>
<p>federation, generally secret, of many persons whose intent is to
</p>
<p>injure another by preventing any and all persons from doing busi-
</p>
<p>ness with him through fear of incurring the displeasure, persecu-
</p>
<p>tion, and vengeance of the conspirators."
</p>
<p>Trade conspiracy frequently contemplates boycotting as a means
</p>
<p>to the end sought, that is the coercion of the party conspired
</p>
<p>against. The word is not easily defined. It is frequently spoken
</p>
<p>of as passive, merely,  a let-alone policy, a withdrawal of all busi-
</p>
<p>ness relations, intercourse, and fellowship. If that is its only
</p>
<p>meaning, the individual withdrawal of patronage, it will be
</p>
<p>difficult to find anything in it criminal. AVe may gather some
</p>
<p>idea of its real meaning, however, by a reference to the circum-
</p>
<p>stances under which the word originated. Those circumstances are
</p>
<p>thus narrated by Mr. Justin H. McCarthy, an Irish writer of
</p>
<p>learning and ability, who will be recognized as good authority.
</p>
<p>In his work entitled " England under Gladstone," he says: "The
</p>
<p>strike was supported by a form of action, or rather inaction,
</p>
<p>which soon became historical. Captain Boycott was an English-
</p>
<p>man, an agent of Lord Earne, and a farmer of Lough Mask, in
</p>
<p>the wild and beautiful district of Connemara. In his capacity as
</p>
<p>agent he had served notices upon Lord Earne's tenants, and the
</p>
<p>tenants suddenly retaliated in the most unexpected way by, in
</p>
<p>the language of schools and society, sending Captain Boycott to
</p>
<p>Coventry in a very thorough manner. The population of the
</p>
<p>region for miles around resolved not to have anything to do with
</p>
<p>him, and, as far as they could prevent it, not to allow anyone else
</p>
<p>to have anything to do with him. His life appeared to be in
</p>
<p>danger ; he had to claim police protection. His servants fled
</p>
<p>from him as servants flee from their masters in some plague-
</p>
<p>stricken Italian city. The awful sentence of excommunication
</p>
<p>could hardly have rendered him more helftlessly alone for a time ;

<p>most unpleasant imitation of Theocritan shepherds and shepherd-

</p>
<p>But whenever courts of law have made use of the term " boy-

</p>
<p>combination and agreement among defendants, owners of steam-
</p>
<p>ers, with intent to injure plaintiffs and prevent them from obtain-
</p>
<p>ing cargoes for their steamers between ports, agreeing to refuse,

<p>and refusing, to accept cargoes from shippers, except upon terms
</p>
<p>that shippers could not ship by plaintiff's steamers, and threaten-

<p>ing to stop shipment of homeward cargoes altogether, which

<p>threats they carry into effect,"
</p>
<p>The agreement with keepers of particular boarding-houses not

</p>
<p>boycotting.'
</p>
<p>To incite persons to prevent others from taking or occupying
</p>
<p>farms from which others have been evicted for nonpayment of
</p>
<p>rent is an offense at common law. A combination to prevent
</p>
<p>persons buying goods taken in execution is an offense at common
</p>
<p>law, and is a crime, if the means to carry out these incitements
</p>
<p>were those commonly known as boycotting.*
</p>
<p>Every man has the right to employ his talents, industry, and
</p>
<p>capital as he pleases, free from the dictation of others ; and if two
</p>
<p>or more persons combine to coerce his choice in this behalf, it is

<p>.a criminal conspiracy, whether the means employed are actual

<p>^violence or a species of intimidation that works upon the mind.''

</p>
<p> 78. Indictments for Conspiracy.  Generally the conspiracy
</p>
<p>is indictable as a common law offense, when such offenses are
</p>
<p>recognized as existing at common law.*
</p>
<p>A conspiracy to commit an abortion is not a felony at common
</p>
<p>law.^
</p>
<p>In states where common law crimes are recognized, the legisla-
</p>
<p>tion on the subject of conspiracy does not usually abolish the-
</p>
<p>common law offense.^ The venue where any act in giving effect
</p>
<p>to the conspiracy was performed by any member of the confed-
</p>
<p>eration, may be the place selected for bringing the indictment
</p>
<p>against all the parties concerned in the conspiracy.*
</p>
<p>In stating the object of a conspiracy in an indictment, the same
</p>
<p>certainty and strictness are not required as in the case of an in-
</p>
<p>dictment for the offense conspired to be committed.*
</p>
<p>A general allegation that two or more person conspired to effect
</p>
<p>an object criminal in itself  as to commit a misdemeanor or felony 
</p>
<p>is sufficient, even although the indictment omit all charges of the
</p>
<p>particular means to be used,' and the cases are now equally uni-
</p>
<p>form in holding that if the agreement or combination be to do an
</p>
<p>act or to effect an object not criminal, by the use of unlawful
</p>
<p>means, a general charge of a conspiracy to effect the object is not
</p>
<p>sufficient, and the charge of such a conspiracy must be accompa-
</p>
<p>nied with a particular statement of the means by which the object,
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy was to be effected, so that these means may
</p>
<p>appear to be criminal, or the indictment will be bad.^
</p>
<p>It is only necessary to set forth the specific means intended to-
</p>

</p>
<p>When the criminality of a conspiracy consists in an unlawful

<p>of the indictment was defective in not specifying the means bjr
</p>
<p>which the conspiracy was to be effected/
</p>
<p>"When the means used are unlawful under the statute, and the-
</p>
<p>purpose is unlawful at common law, the words of the statute may
</p>
<p>be used without setting forth their meaning, and it is unnecessary
</p>
<p>to state specifically the kind of threats, or methods of intimida-
</p>
<p>tion used.
</p>
<p>AVhere the charge is that the defendants "unlawfully, fraudu-
</p>
<p>lently and deceitfully did conspire, combine, confederate and
</p>
<p>agree together to cheat and defraud" it is sufficient.^
</p>
<p>The doing of an overt act must be charged, though the partic-
</p>
<p>ular act is not set out, nor actual injury alleged, and except when
</p>
<p>the conspiracy is to cheat a particular set of persons or the pub-
</p>
<p>lic generally, the names of the persons intended to be imposed
</p>
<p>upon must be stated if known.^

<p>In Reg. v. Rowlands, 17 Q. B. 671, the indictment charged a.
</p>
<p>conspiracy to force workmen to quit the employment of certain
</p>
<p>persons by the use of threats and intimidation. The Statute of
</p>
<p>6 Geo. IV., chap. 129,  3, forbids the use of such means, and the

<p>court said: "It is objected that some counts do not disclose the

<p>The words used in the statute have a meaning stamped upon

<p>mitted, in words that will describe it as a conclusion of law. Th&
</p>
<p>means need not be particularly set out.'
</p>
<p>If an act in its natural characteristics and quality is unlawful,
</p>
<p>knowledge of its wrongful character is presumed, and no aver-
</p>
<p>ment of such knowledge is required in the indictment. But it is-
</p>
<p>otherwise when the act only becomes illegal or wrongful by the
</p>
<p>presence of accidental or fortuitous features not usually attendant
</p>
<p>upon the doing of the particular thing. Thus in State v. Car-
</p>
<p>penter^ 54 Vt. 551, the respondent was presumed to know that it
</p>
<p>was unlawful for him to assault an individual. But when the act
</p>
<p>was enlarged to the offense of impeding an officer in the discharge
</p>
<p>of his duty, it took on a character so abnormal that knowledge
</p>
<p>of this artificial quality of his act by the respondent must be
</p>
<p>alleged in order to lay a basis for the charge of a guilty intent.*
</p>
<p>"Where a statute provides for the definition and punishment of
</p>
<p>a felonious conspiracy, and for an additional punishment for any
</p>
<p>overt act of a criminal nature, which is committed in pursuance
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy, the whole being one transaction, the description,
</p>
<p>in an indictment for the conspiracy of the crime as an entirety, is
</p>
<p>necessary and proper, although such description requires the set-
</p>
<p>ting out of the facts constituting the separate crime.^
</p>
<p>The offense of conspiracy may be complete without the com-
</p>
<p>mission of the overt act which the conspirators agreed to commit.*
</p>
<p>But of course no civil action will lie for simply conspiring to do
</p>
<p>an unlawful act, as the act itself and resulting injury to plaintiff
</p>
<p>are the very grounds of action.^
</p>
<p>Unless the statute requires that the overt act should be charged
</p>
<p>if it has been committed, it is unnecessary to do so.^ But it must
</p>
<p>be so alleged if the statute requires it.'

</p>
<p>It may, indeed, be alleged in aggravation of the offense and
</p>
<p>given in evidence to prove the conspiracy,' Though the ofiense
</p>
<p>of conspiracy, even when the overt act is committed, is complete
</p>
<p>before the commission of the overt act, in the sense that nothing
</p>
<p>more is necessary to complete the crime, yet the conspiracy must
</p>
<p>be deemed to continue until the overt act is committed;'* and it is
</p>
<p>a renewal of the conspiracy.'
</p>
<p>And in every case that can be adduced of conspiracy the offense
</p>
<p>depends upon the unlawful agreement and not on the act which
</p>
<p>follows it; the latter is but the evidence of the former. The
</p>
<p>offense is therefore complete when the confederacy is made.*
</p>
<p>A conspiracy is a substantive offense and punishable at common
</p>
<p>law, though nothing be done in execution of it;* and all the
</p>
<p>authorities agree that the conspiracy is the gist of the offense,"
</p>
<p>Under a statute declaring it a " criminal conspiracy to unlaw-
</p>
<p>fully and maliciously obstruct and impede the business of corpor-
</p>
<p>ations," the indictment need not set forth that the defendants did
</p>
<p>more than conspire to do the acts.''
</p>
<p>From all which it results that every conspiracy to do an unlaw-
</p>
<p>ful act, or to do a lawful act for an illegal, fraudulent, malicious,
</p>

<p>INDICTMENT FOB CONSPIKACY. 417
</p>
<p>In punishing a conspiracy, not carried into execution, the law-
</p>
<p>does not punish a mere unexecuted intention. It is the act of
</p>
<p>conspiring, not the mere intention to do this. Until the conspir-
</p>
<p>acy is formed, it is mere individual intent and not punishable.
</p>
<p>But when it is formed, each individual intent has been united in
</p>
<p>one common purpose, and a new element of danger to social order
</p>
<p>has sprung into existence ; an element whose essense is union,
</p>
<p>and which in turn is met by the united force of the civil and
</p>
<p>criminal law. The individual must rely on individual effort to
</p>
<p>protect himself from individual falsehood, fraud and malice, and
</p>
<p>when he fails he may resort to the civil law to redress his civil
</p>
<p>wrongs, but against concerted fraud, falsehood and malice the law
</p>
<p>interposes to avert the intended blow, and arrests the conspirators
</p>
<p>before the consummation of the proposed purpose. The act of
</p>
<p>conspiring is like that of unlawful assembling. The act of assem-
</p>
<p>bling to do an unlawful act is a crime, though no other act but the
</p>
<p>meeting together for such purpose is shown.
</p>
<p>The intention of any number of men acting separately, so long
</p>
<p>as they do nothing, is not a crime of which the law will take cog-
</p>
<p>nizance; but when several men form the intent and come together,
</p>
<p>and agree to carry it into execution, the conspiracy as generally
</p>
<p>defined by statute is completely formed. The combination then
</p>
<p>becomes dangerous and subversive of the rights of others, and the
</p>
<p>law declares it a crime.' The least degree of consent or collusion
</p>
<p>between parties to an illegal transaction makes the act of one the
</p>
<p>act of the others.^ But a mere presence on the occasion of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy is not sufficient to make one guilty. One must incite,
</p>
<p>procure, or encourage the act; ' but if one join the conspiracy
</p>
<p>after it is formed, he becomes a co-conspirator, and the acts of
</p>
<p>others become his acts by adoption." But that two conspired to
</p>
<p>do an act so that a third person would commit a felony, does not
</p>
<p>sufficiently charge that the purpose of conspiring to do the act was
</p>
<p>to induce the third party to commit it.*

<p>The consummated conspiracy should be so alleged when the
</p>
<p>facts will sustain the charge, and not the mere conspiracy to com-
</p>

</p>
<p>The charge of conspiracy cannot be aided by averment of acts
</p>
<p>done by one or more of the conspirators where the conspiracy
</p>
<p>itself is not sufficiently charged.*
</p>
<p>But there need not be a detailed statement of the connection

</p>
<p>The charge that a conspiracy existed to obstruct justice by divers

</p>
<p> 79. Evidence in Conspiracy.  Conspiracy is in its nature a
</p>
<p>joint offense, and cannot, either under common law or under stat-
</p>
<p>ute, be committed by one alone; but the proof must show that two
</p>
<p>or more persons were engaged in the offense.*
</p>
<p>An action for a conspiracy will not therefore lie against a hus-
</p>
<p>band and wife alone, as they are in law one person.^ Althougli
</p>
<p>if a man and woman marry in the name of another for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of raising a specious title to the estate of the person whose
</p>
<p>name is assumed, it is a conspiracy.^
</p>
<p>As soon as the union of wills for the unlawful purpose is per-
</p>
<p>fected, the offense under the usual statutory definition of the
</p>
<p>crime of conspiracy is complete. This joint assent of minds may
</p>
<p>be established by facts and circumstances, and by even slight
</p>
<p>evidence of collusion, or by circumstantial evidence. Evidence of
</p>
<p>a conspiracy between two persons to commit an assault upon another
</p>
<p>is not essential to the conviction of one who does not strike the
</p>
<p>blow, when he was present prepared to assist, and did in fact in-
</p>
<p>terfere by jumping upon the assailed person and seizing him, so
</p>
<p>that it required two men to pull him off.*
</p>
<p>An agreement, to constitute a conspiracy, need not be ex-
</p>
<p>pressed in words, but may be gathered from the conduct of the
</p>
<p>parties.*
</p>
<p>The agreement itself is an act in advancement of the intent of
</p>
<p>each.'

</p>
<p>In criminal law no overt act is necessary to constitute the
</p>
<p>offense.' Concurrence of sentiment and co-operative conduct in
</p>
<p>a criminal enterprise, and not formality of speech, are the essen-
</p>
<p>tial ingredients of a criminal conspiracy.''
</p>
<p>To constitute conspiracy the combination must l)e corrupt.' It
</p>
<p>must be a joint, malicious and willful common purpose."
</p>
<p>Statutes have been passed in various states to prevent and pun-
</p>
<p>ish a course of proceeding not defined at the common law, and of
</p>
<p>comparatively recent origin ; to punish all unlawful interference
</p>
<p>with the business of another, when such interference is shown to
</p>
<p>be willful and malicious, although the act is not inspired, as in
</p>
<p>the common law oliense, by any particular wantonness, cruelty,
</p>
<p>or revenge against the owner of the property, but to obstruct the
</p>
<p>business of others that the conspirators may gain thereby some
</p>
<p>advantage or profit to themselves.
</p>
<p>In Michigan a statute declares that "if two or more persons
</p>
<p>shall willfully and maliciously combine or conspire together to
</p>
<p>obstruct or impede by any act, or by means of intimidation, the
</p>
<p>regular operation or conduct of the business of any railroad com-
</p>
<p>pany, or any other corporation, firm, or individual of this State,
</p>
<p>or to impede, hinder or obstruct, except by due process of law,
</p>
<p>the regular running of any locomotive, engine, freight or passen-
</p>
<p>ger train on any railroad, or the labor and business of any such
</p>
<p>corporation, firm or individual, such persons shall, on conviction
</p>
<p>thereof, be punished," etc.*
</p>
<p>Under this statute, malice against the owner of the business
</p>
<p>disturbed, or his property, is not required to be shown in the
</p>
<p>same sense as does the common law in cases of malicious mis-
</p>
<p>chief."

<p>he cannot complain if lie is charged with having conspired with
</p>
<p>them in producing the resnlts, even though the names of his co-
</p>
<p>conspirators are unknown.'
</p>
<p>Where a number of persons combine with a common design to
</p>
<p>do an unlawful act to which the ordinary law of conspiracy
</p>
<p>applies, the acts and declarations of each, done in furtherance
</p>
<p>of the common design, are the acts and declarations of all.^ Each
</p>
<p>conspirator is responsible for everything done by his confederates
</p>
<p>which follows on the execution of the common design, as one of
</p>
<p>its probable and natural consequences, even though it w^as not
</p>
<p>intended as a part of the original design or common plan."
</p>
<p>When men combine to do an unlawful thing, and in the prose-
</p>
<p>cution of their intent one goes a step beyond the rest of the party,
</p>
<p>and does acts which they do not perform, all are responsible for
</p>
<p>what he does ; but there should be shown some concert of agree-
</p>
<p>ment  an agreement to do some unlawful thing/ But if the act
</p>
<p>is not the natural and probable outcome of the common design,
</p>
<p>but is the independent act of some of the party, outside of the
</p>
<p>common purpose, the others are not responsible for it."
</p>
<p>When an unlawful act agreed to be done is not of a dangerous
</p>
<p>or homicidal character, or its execution does not necessarily or
</p>
<p>probably require the use of such force or violence as may naturally
</p>
<p>or probably produce death, and a person is killed by one of the
</p>
<p>conspirators while such act is being done, such killing is regarded
</p>
<p>by the law as collateral to the conspiracy to commit the other
</p>
<p>crime ; and he only who does the killing is liable for such killing."
</p>
<p>Each conspirator is responsible only for things done by his
</p>
<p>confederates which follow incidentally in the execution of the

<p>common design, as its natural consequence. But it is not admis-

</p>
<p>accomplish the common purpose/
</p>
<p>An agreement to commit a robbery is an agreement to do such
</p>
<p>an act that if a person is killed in the execution of it all who are
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy to rob, and are aiding in executing it at the
</p>
<p>time of the killing, are guilty of murder ; for the crime of robbery
</p>
<p>is homicidal in its character."
</p>
<p>When the means are not specifically agreed upon, each con-
</p>
<p>spirator becomes responsible for the means used by any co-con-
</p>
<p>spirator in the accomplishment of the purpose.^
</p>
<p>One engaged in a conspiracy to mob prisoners in custody of
</p>
<p>the law is none the less liable to punishment because he went with
</p>
<p>the prisoners as guard or was an officer in charge of them."
</p>
<p>The same rule as to the admission of acts or declarations of
</p>
<p>one conspirator applies in civil as well as in criminal cases.''
</p>
<p>When a conspiracy is charged between two or more, the acts
</p>
<p>of one person engaged in the conspiracy are the acts of all the
</p>

</p>
<p>vidual acts of the one.'

<p>When several persons take part in the execution of a criminal

</p>
<p>act (to keep in its employ wT)rkmen of its own choice) which it
</p>
<p>had a legal right to do, and to do an act (employ the defendants
</p>
<p>and such persons as they should name) which it had a legal right
</p>
<p>to abstain from doing, charges acts clearly prohibited. The fact
</p>
<p>that the threat is designed as a means to an end, and that end in
</p>
<p>itself considered a lawful one, does not devest the transaction of
</p>
<p>its criminality. They had not the right to say to the publishing
</p>
<p>company: "You shall do this or we will ruin your business." It
</p>
<p>is no answer to say that the conspiracy was for a lawful purpose;
</p>
<p>to better their own condition; to fix and advance their rate of
</p>
<p>wages, and further their own material interest. The charge that
</p>
<p>this conspiracy contemplated the wholesale boycotting of the
</p>
<p>patrons of the publishing company states an offense. Prima facie
</p>
<p>such conduct must be considered malicious and corrupt. Where
</p>
<p>there was proof that the "boycott" was inaugurated and prosecuted
</p>
<p>by a typographical union, of which the five or six persons in
</p>
<p>conversation, including the identified defendant, were members
</p>
<p>their declarations were admissible. Evidence was properly ad-
</p>
<p>mitted of a conversation between five or six printers, members of
</p>
<p>the union, among whom was one identified as a defendant, and
</p>
<p>others not identified. Evidence was properly admitted after there
</p>
<p>had been proof introduced tending to show that a particular de-
</p>
<p>fendant had been active in attempting to induce the public not to
</p>
<p>patronize the paper published by the publishing company. It.
</p>
<p>was held proper, on the trial, to admit the declarations of a con-
</p>
<p>spirator, not a defendant, made in the presence of one of the
</p>
<p>defendants, to a workman of the company, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>inducing him to join the conspiracy, that he believed that the
</p>
<p>company would not fight, as another publishing company had
</p>
<p>done. A circular as follows, in large letters, "A word to the wise
</p>
<p>is sufficient: Boycott the Journal and Courier," was ruled to be
</p>
<p>admissible in evidence. A notice to the "News" that it would be

<p>EVIDENCE IN CONSPIKACY. 425
</p>
<p>The acts and declarations of one conspirator, made in the ab-
</p>
<p>sence of the others, in furtherance of the common design, are in
</p>
<p>ordinary cases only admissible after a prima facie case of conspir-
</p>
<p>acy has been made out by competent evidence.'
</p>
<p>The admission in evidence of statements of alleged co-conspira-
</p>
<p>tors, made in the absence of the defendant, before the existence
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy has been established, is within the discretion of
</p>
<p>the trial judge. Declarations of co-conspirators, made in the
</p>
<p>absence of defendant, are admissible against him when made in
</p>
<p>furtherance of the conspiracy, but not when made in a casual
</p>
<p>conversation with neighbors, and not in furtherance of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, although relating to the subject-m.atter thereof.'
</p>
<p>Yet when several men form the intent and come together and
</p>
<p>agree to carry it into execution, this agreement is a step in tiie
</p>
<p>direction of accomplishing the purpose, and it is a crime.' And
</p>
<p>if it be proved that the defendants pursued by their acts the same
</p>
<p>object, often using the same means, one performing one part, and
</p>
<p>another another part of the same object, the jury will be justiHed
</p>
<p>in concluding they were engaged in a conspiracy to effect the
</p>
<p>same object.*
</p>
<p>The rule requiring a conspiracy to be first established cannot
</p>
<p>well be enforced where the proof of the conspiracy depends upon
</p>
<p>a vast amount of circumstantial evidence, a vast amount of isolated
</p>
<p>and independent facts; and in any case, where such acts and
</p>
<p>declarations are introduced in evidence, and the entire proof,
</p>
<p>taken together, shows that such conspiracy actually exists  it will
</p>
<p>be considered immaterial whether the conspiracy was established
</p>
<p>before or after the introduction of the acts and declarations of the
</p>
<p>several persons charged."
</p>
<p>The prosecutor may either prove the conspiracy which renders
</p>
<p>the acts of the conspirators admissible in evidence, or he may
</p>
<p>prove the acts of the different persons, and thus prove the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy.*

</p>
<p>When a conspiracy has been proved sayings and movements of

</p>
<p>But when the common design has been consummated nothing
</p>
<p>said or done by one can affect the other.^
</p>
<p>Where a conspiracy arises out of a concert of action and with-

<p>out any previous agreement as to its purpose or extent, the respon-
</p>
<p>sibility of any one of the consjjirators ceases when he withdraws
</p>
<p>his aid and encouragement or countenance from the enterprise,

<p>but his mere absence from the scene of the unlawful act will not
</p>
<p>exonerate him wdien he lends his aid and encouragement to the

<p>acts and the purpose for which they are committed.* So long as

</p>
<p>Hon. Charles A. Rat,
</p>
<p>40 Wall St., New York.
</p>
<p>My Dear Sir :
</p>
<p>At present a large business is done in buying and selling for
</p>
<p>future delivery, cotton, wheat, corn, oats, pork, bacon, lard, coffee,
</p>
<p>.and the manufactured products of cotton and flour mills. These
</p>
<p>transactions are designated as "Cotton Futures," "Wheat
</p>
<p>Futures," " Coffee Futures," etc., to distinguish them from trans-
</p>
<p>actions for the immediate or prompt delivery of those com-
</p>
<p>modities. The transactions in " futures," for their own account
</p>
<p>and for account of their customers, are made by members of
</p>
<p>regularly incorporated commercial exchanges at Kew York,
</p>
<p>Chicago, ISTew Orleans, Liverpool, Havre, etc. Each exchange
</p>
<p>has rules for the regulation of the business in "futures" based
</p>
<p>upon commercial law and equity, and every transaction made is
</p>
<p>subject to these rules. Actual delivery by the seller and actual
</p>
<p>receipt by the buyer is contemplated of every contract for future
</p>
<p>-delivery which is entered into. The rules of the exchanges im-

</p>
<p>pose money penalties for the nondelivery of the merchandise con-
</p>
<p>tracted to be delivered, measured in such degree that a failure ta
</p>
<p>deliver will cost the seller more than to purchase the commodity
</p>
<p>in the open market and fulfill his contract. Money penalties are
</p>
<p>likewise imposed for the failure to receive the article bought for
</p>
<p>future delivery, so that it will cost the delinquent buyer more to
</p>
<p>violate his contract than to keep it. The rules regulating the
</p>
<p>business in futures for cotton, grain, coffee, and other commodi-
</p>
<p>ties are all based upon the same general principles and contemplate
</p>
<p>the actual fulfillment of every contract.
</p>
<p>Trading in cotton futures was established in New York in 1870
</p>
<p>and in New Orleans a few years later. As I am more familiar
</p>
<p>with the cotton trade than with the other trades in which transac-
</p>
<p>tions in futures are made I will confine my remarks more especi-
</p>
<p>ally to cotton futures. Contracts in cotton futui^es are made for
</p>
<p>the delivery in lots of 100 bales during the month contracted for,
</p>
<p>such delivery to be at the seller's option upon 5 days notice to
</p>
<p>the buyer. An order on a warehouse for the cotton is tendered
</p>
<p>for every notice of delivery, by the seller to the party to whom he
</p>
<p>has sold. If the buyer has also sold the cotton for delivery dur-
</p>
<p>ing the month for which he has received notice, it is customary
</p>
<p>for him to transfer the notice of delivery and warehouse order to
</p>
<p>the party to whom he has sold, and such transfers are made until
</p>
<p>3 P. M., of the day of issuing the notice or until its receijjt before
</p>
<p>that hour by a party who has bought but has not sold, or whO'
</p>
<p>desires to receive the cotton, and this party receives the cotton
</p>
<p>from the one who issued the notice and warehouse order and pay&
</p>
<p>for it. As those who have bought and sold have no interest
</p>
<p>beyond the difference in the price at which they bought and the
</p>
<p>price at which they sold, it would be a useless expense to have
</p>
<p>the cost of delivery and receipt incurred for each change of
</p>
<p>ownership, when the passing of the warehouse order accomplishes
</p>
<p>every purpose and saves unnecessary charges. All intermediate
</p>
<p>parties between the party who issues the notice and warehouse

<p>order and the party who receives the cotton settle with each other
</p>
<p>the difference between the price of their respective contracts and
</p>
<p>the price at which the cotton is received and paid for. In the
</p>
<p>course of business it happens that many contracts are settled
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 431
</p>
<p>before the month of their maturity and without actual delivery
</p>
<p>of cotton. For instance, a merchant may sell for a planter a con-
</p>
<p>tract for October delivery, and the next day he may buy for a
</p>
<p>Southern cotton buyer a contract for delivery the same month, and
</p>
<p>if these transactions are made with the same party on the ex-
</p>
<p>change, a direct settlement would be made as between the two
</p>
<p>members of the exchange.
</p>
<p>A merchant might sell to a party, who might sell to another,
</p>
<p>and this other might have previously sold to the first party  all
</p>
<p>the transactions being for the same month's delivery. This
</p>
<p>would make a settlement of contracts between the three and is
</p>
<p>called a "ring settlement." These "ring settlements" are purely
</p>
<p>matters of chance. They may be affected very soon after the
</p>
<p>transaction, or they may not occur for months, and they may not
</p>
<p>occur at all. They do not in the slightest degree enter into the
</p>
<p>matter of the original transaction which is based upon the prob-
</p>
<p>ability and intention of actual delivery of the coUon contracted
</p>
<p>for. In much of the legitimate business at present the transac-
</p>
<p>tions in futures are of great benefit to producers, manufacturers,
</p>
<p>merchants, bankers, and the general public.
</p>
<p>About three fourths of the cotton crop is usually marketed dur-
</p>
<p>ing the first four months of the season. If such a large propor-
</p>
<p>tion of the crop was forced upon the market for immediate sale,,
</p>
<p>the effect would certainly be to unduly and greatly depress prices.
</p>
<p>By the sale of futures against consignments of actual cotton relief
</p>
<p>is often given to an overstocked market and better prices are
</p>
<p>secured for the planter than would otherwise be possible. If
</p>
<p>prices are satisfactory, the planter can direct his merchant to sell
</p>
<p>futures against his crop before it is actually ready to be marketed
</p>
<p>and thus secure the benefit of a remunerative price which might
</p>
<p>not be obtained if the sale could not be made until his crop had
</p>
<p>actually reached a market.
</p>
<p>Manufacturers of cotton goods, knowing the quantity of cotton
</p>
<p>required by their mills for the season can buy futures against

</p>
<p>their requirements, and being thus enabled to fix the cost of their
</p>
<p>raw material can safely make contracts for the product of their
</p>
<p>mills for months ahead. But for the abihty to buy futures, the
</p>
<p>mills would be compelled to purchase large supplies of cotton at
</p>
<p>432 APPEWDIX.
</p>
<p>the beginning of each season (losing interest and the expense of
</p>
<p>carrying the cotton) or forego making sales of their product
</p>
<p>beyond their purchases of actual cotton. Under the present
</p>
<p>system it is customary for the mills to sell their product for
</p>
<p>delivery many months ahead, thus ensuring constant work and
</p>
<p>with no risk of loss by fluctuations in the cost of cotton. This
</p>
<p>method of conducting business enables a mill of small capital to
</p>
<p>compete successfully with concerns of greater means, for neither
</p>
<p>are compelled to carry large stocks of actual cotton. The mills
</p>
<p>can sell their goods at a smaller margin and yet do a safe and
</p>
<p>remunerative business if they can make certain and easy provision
</p>
<p>for the cost of their supply of cotton for the season. Cotton
</p>
<p>factors and country merchants are protected in their ad.
</p>
<p>vances on the growing crops or on consignments of actual cotton
</p>
<p>if enabled to take advantage of favorable prices and sell futures
</p>
<p>for account of their customers, against the cotton. Fertilizers are
</p>
<p>extensively sold payable in cotton to be delivered in the fall at a
</p>
<p>fixed price  so many pounds of middling cotton for each ton of
</p>
<p>fertilizers. The sale of cotton futures by fertilizer dealers against
</p>
<p>the cotton to be received by them enables them to fix, months
</p>
<p>beforehand, the money price which they are to get per ton for
</p>
<p>their fertilizers. Bankers can more safely, and will therefore
</p>
<p>more readily make loans upon cotton, if in the event of default
</p>
<p>by the Ijorrower, they can protect themselves immediately by
</p>
<p>sales of cotton futures against the cotton held as collateral.
</p>
<p>Exchange finds readier sale when the bankers who buy it have
</p>
<p>every assurance that the cotton against which it is drawn has long
</p>
<p>since been sold for future delivery and will not incur the risk of
</p>
<p>being sold upon a declining market after its arrival in Europe.
</p>
<p>Every method which removes or lessens the element of uncer-
</p>
<p>tainty and risk in any industry enables the price to be reduced
</p>
<p>without diminishing the profits and thus inures to the benefit of
</p>
<p>the general public.
</p>
<p>The tendency of business in every staple is to reduce the charges

</p>
<p>between the producer and consumer (and by "consumer " I mean
</p>
<p>cotton mills, flour mills, pork packers, etc.) to a minimum and to
</p>
<p>dispense as much as possible with "middlemen." In former
</p>
<p>years spinners bought their cotton through commission merchants
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 433
</p>
<p>to whom thej paid a commission on the purchases made for them
</p>
<p>and also all expenses of recei%'ing and shipping the cotton. This
</p>
<p>custom has been generally abandoned and the spinners now buy
</p>
<p>of dealers at a price which includes the first cost of the cotton,
</p>
<p>the receiving and shipping charges and the dealer's profit. The
</p>
<p>dealer is given from 10 to 60 days (according to agreement) in
</p>
<p>which to ship the cotton. Usually the dealer does not own the
</p>
<p>cotton when he makes the sale, but immediately upon closing the
</p>
<p>transaction protects himself by buying cotton futures in Xew
</p>
<p>York or New Orleans against the operation. As he purchases the
</p>
<p>actual cotton of a quality to suit the requirements of his sale, he
</p>
<p>resells his futures to a like extent and thus insures himself against
</p>
<p>loss. By reason of his ability to " hedge," as it were, against his
</p>
<p>sales to spinners he is enabled to do business at a smaller margin
</p>
<p>and with far less risk than if he had to take the chance of an
</p>
<p>advance in price before he had succeeded in buying the cotton to
</p>
<p>deliver upon his sale. This enables the buyer to pay a higher
</p>
<p>price for the cotton just to the extent of the smaller profit he is
</p>
<p>willing to take because of his lessened risk. If compelled to
</p>
<p>exact a larger profit for his risk he must pay a less price to the
</p>
<p>planter, for the price of cotton is regulated by what the spinners
</p>
<p>are willing to pay and not l)y what the planter wishes to get.
</p>
<p>It is undeniably true that there is much of pure speculation in
</p>
<p>futures for cotton, grain, etc. This cannot be prevented, but
</p>
<p>should not cause people to overlook the benefits conferred upon
</p>
<p>legitimate business by this system of trading. Every kind of
</p>
<p>business is in some degree speculative. No article of merchandise
</p>
<p>remains constantly at the same fixed value. The most conserva-
</p>
<p>tive of retail dealers takes the risk of his stock of goods declining
</p>
<p>in market value before he can dispose of it. This risk is a specu-
</p>
<p>lation, but it is called good foresight or bad foresight according to
</p>
<p>its result. The retail dealer tries to read the future of prices and
</p>
<p>trade and buys heavily or sparingly according to his view of the
</p>
<p>future. It is simply a speculation upon his correctness in fore-

<p>casting: the future. A builder will contract to erect a block of
</p>
<p>houses before he owns the necessary lumber, bricks, stone and
</p>
<p>hardware. A railroad contractor will contract to build a railway
</p>
<p>before buying a cross-tie or a length of steel rail. Does anyone
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>434 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>class the builders and the railway contractors as mere speculators^
</p>
<p>and yet the element of speculation enters largely into all their
</p>
<p>transactions. The planter who sells only sufficient of his crop to
</p>
<p>pay advances and meet present wants, and holds back the remain-
</p>
<p>der in the hope of getting a higher price for it, is quite as much
</p>
<p>of a speculator as the merchant who buys the planter's cotton and
</p>
<p>holds it for an advance. In this country of boundless possibilities
</p>
<p>a majority of men take hopeful views of things. In all specula-
</p>
<p>tive affairs vastly more people operate for an advance than for
</p>
<p>lower prices. More speculators are interested always in putting
</p>
<p>up prices than in depressing values. Farmers who raise grain and
</p>
<p>cotton should not object to these allies, the " bulls " of specula-
</p>
<p>tion, for their elation often advances prices beyond their proper
</p>
<p>level.
</p>
<p>The " bears " of speculation, who sell what they do not own
</p>
<p>and then try to depress values so as to buy it back at a price lower
</p>
<p>than at which they sold, are often the means of advancing prices.
</p>
<p>Nothing exceeds the eagerness to buy of the " bear" who has sold
</p>
<p>what he did not possess and finds the market advancing. In his
</p>
<p>haste to buy he does not stop at trifles, and often forces prices far
</p>
<p>above a proper rate. His efforts are often a source of real strengtli
</p>
<p>to an otherwise weak market. Merchants all understand this, and
</p>
<p>after a while I trust farmers will also realize it and cease their
</p>
<p>attacks upon the business of trading in futures. It will readily
</p>
<p>be admitted that the more buyers there are for any commodity
</p>
<p>the better the chances are for good prices. This is but another
</p>
<p>way of stating the proposition that prices are regulated by supply
</p>
<p>and demand, and that the greater the demand the higher the
</p>
<p>price. Every " bear " operator who sells what he does not own
</p>
<p>will sooner or later, but inevitably, have to buy it. The more he
</p>
<p>sells the more he will have to buy, and he cannot dictate the price
</p>
<p>he will have to pay, for the seller will have a large share in regu-
</p>
<p>lating that matter. It not infrequently happens that "bears" are
</p>
<p>about the only people who do want to buy, and at such times

</p>
<p>prices would inevitably decline, and perhaps seriously, but for
</p>
<p>their opportune buying.
</p>
<p>In closing this communication it is proper that I should refer
</p>
<p>to a comparatively new but very large business which is now done
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 435
</p>
<p>in actual grain and cotton through the instrumentality of dealing
</p>
<p>in future deliveries and as an outgrowth of that system. This is
</p>
<p>the buying of actual grain and cotton by merchants who store the
</p>
<p>produce and sell contracts for future delivery against their pur-
</p>
<p>chases. The price for futures is usually enough higher than the
</p>
<p>price of the article for immediate delivery to cover storage, insur-
</p>
<p>ance, loss in weight and a fair interest to the time of delivery.
</p>
<p>This is a perfectly legitimate business, and while, as a rule, it
</p>
<p>pays only moderate profits, there is very little risk involved. It
</p>
<p>affords a safe and fairly remunerative employment of capital
</p>
<p>which otherwise would seek investment in other channels. This
</p>
<p>business is of great benefit to farmers, because it provides a.
</p>
<p>demand for the surplus production of grain and cotton beyond
</p>
<p>the immediate wants of the flour and cotton mills, which demand
</p>
<p>takes the weight of this surplus from the market and carries it
</p>
<p>until needed for actual consumption. If this class of buyers wa&
</p>
<p>taken from the market by the discontinuance of the system of
</p>
<p>trading in ' futures,' all articles of produce for which transactions
</p>
<p>for future deliveries are now made would have to find a market
</p>
<p>at the price at which manufacturers would be willing to buy and
</p>
<p>keep the produce until needed for consumption. There would be
</p>
<p>no competition with the mill owners, and it is but reasonable to
</p>
<p>suppose that tliey would form combinations to regulate prices, and
</p>
<p>that very much lower figures would rule than if competitive buy-
</p>
<p>ers were in the market. At j)resent there is a stock of cotton in
</p>
<p>New York of 388,000 bales and in New Orleans of 449,000 bales,
</p>
<p>the combined stock in the two markets being nearly twice as much
</p>
<p>as at the corresponding time last year. Sales of futures have been
</p>
<p>made against a very large proportion of this immense stock, thus
</p>
<p>relieving the markets of a pressure which would inevitably have car-
</p>
<p>ried prices far below the present rates which are lower than for 43
</p>
<p>years. Mr. A. J. Sawyer, a prominent merchant and capitalist of
</p>
<p>Minneapolis, owns 175 grain elevators located upon the lines of
</p>
<p>the Northern Pacific and the Manitoba railroads, ,nd buys wheat

<p>directly of the farmers, selling futures against his purchases. By
</p>
<p>his methods of business the farmers in the vicinity of his elevators
</p>
<p>are given a near and constant market for their wheat and at fair
</p>
<p>prices. I am told his payments for wheat often amount to
</p>
<p>436  APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>:$150,000 a day. His immense business which is of such great
</p>
<p>advantage to the farmers could not be carried on without the
</p>
<p>existing facilities for selling wheat futures in Chicago and New
</p>
<p>York. Indeed Mr. Sawyer has recently made a statement to this
</p>
<p>effect to a committee of Congress.
</p>
<p>Nearly everything which I have written concerning cotton will
</p>
<p>apply equally to grain and provisions.

<p>ALFRED B. SHEPPEESON.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 437
</p>
<p>B.
</p>
<p>The bills to prevent dealing in "options" and "futures," now
</p>
<p>pending in Congress, and one of which, in the improbable event
</p>
<p>of there being any legislation, will likely pass, are the one intro-
</p>
<p>duced in the Senate, December lith, 1891, by Senator Washburn,
</p>
<p>and the other introduced in the House of Representatives, Janu-
</p>
<p>ary 11th, 1S92, by Congressman Hatch.
</p>
<p>It does not follow that because either of these measures are
</p>
<p>advocated by two or three of the largest manufacturers of flour,
</p>
<p>that this is done in the general interest of the producers of that
</p>
<p>article. It is possible if either of these bills pass, that when wheat
</p>
<p>comes upon the market after harvest in immense quantities and
</p>
<p>is thereby depressed in price,  there being then no market for
</p>
<p>"futures"  these wealthy manufacturers may purchase their year's
</p>
<p>supply, storing it for use; and the smaller manufacturer, not being
</p>
<p>able to make this investment, and not being permitted to contract
</p>
<p>for the future delivery to them of the wheat, will be driven out
</p>
<p>of the business; and it may chance, that the means thus taken to
</p>
<p>prevent dealing in "futures," will result in reducing the compe-
</p>
<p>tition among the purchasers of wheat, contracting the time within
</p>
<p>which it must be sold, forcing it on the market, and thereby de-
</p>
<p>pressing its price, and at the same time creating a monopoly in
</p>
<p>flour, which will increase its price, placing the difference in the
</p>
<p>pockets of the manufacturer, and degrading the quality. Crude
</p>
<p>legislation to control the course of trade, does not always result
</p>
<p>advantageously.
</p>
<p>The pi'oposed legislation is as follows:
</p>
<p>A Bill Deflning "(3ptions" and "Futures" and Imposing Spe-
</p>
<p>cial Taxes on Dealers Therein, and for Other Purposes.
</p>
<p>Be it Enacted hy tlie Senate and House of Iie_presentatives of
</p>
<p>the United States of America, in Congress assemhled, That for
</p>
<p>the purpose of this Act the word "options" shall be understood
</p>
<p>to mean any contract or agreement whereby a party thereto, or
</p>
<p>any party for whom or in whose behalf such contract or agree-

<p>ment is made, contracts to have or give to himself or another the
</p>
<p>option to buy or sell at a future time any of the grain or other
</p>
<p>commodity mentioned in section three of this Act.
</p>
<p>Sec. 2. That for the purposes of this Act the word "futures"
</p>
<p>438 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>shall be understood to mean any contract or agreement whereby
</p>
<p>a party agrees to buy, or agrees to sell and deliver, at a future
</p>
<p>time to another any of the articles mentioned in section three of
</p>
<p>this Act, when at the time of making such contract or agreement
</p>
<p>the party so agreeing to make such delivery, or the party for
</p>
<p>whom he acts as agent, broker, or employe in making such con-
</p>
<p>tract or agreement, is not at the time of making the same the
</p>
<p>owner of the article so contracted and agreed to be delivered, (or
</p>
<p>unless tlie articles so contracted to be sold and delivered shall
</p>
<p>subsequently be actually delivered to the purchaser for manufac-
</p>
<p>ture or consumption:) Provided, however, That this Act shall
</p>
<p>not apply to any contracts or agreements for the future delivery
</p>
<p>of any of the said articles made with the United States, or any
</p>
<p>State, county, or municipality, or with the duly authorized officers
</p>
<p>or agents thereof, nor to the contracts or agreements made by
</p>
<p>farmers for the sale and delivery of any of the articles aforesaid
</p>
<p>which are in actual course of production by such farmers at the
</p>
<p>time of making such contract or agreement.
</p>
<p>Sec. 3. That the articles to which the foregoing sections relate
</p>
<p>are wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, cotton, and all other farm pro-
</p>
<p>ducts; also pork, lard, and all other hog products.
</p>
<p>Sec. 4. That special taxes are imposed as follows: Dealers in
</p>
<p>^'options" or "futures" shall pay annually the sum of one thous-
</p>
<p>and dollars, and shall also pay the further sum of five cents per
</p>
<p>pound for each and every pound of cotton or pork, lard, or other
</p>
<p>hog products, and the sum of twenty cents per bushel for each
</p>
<p>and every bushel of any of the other articles mentioned in section
</p>
<p>three of this Act, the right and privilege of delivering which may
</p>
<p>be acquired under any "options" contract or agreement as defined
</p>
<p>by section one of this Act, or which may be sold to be
</p>
<p>delivered at a future time or period under any " futures "

<p>of Senate Bill No. 1T57, introduced by the Hon. Mr. Washburn,
</p>
<p>and entitled " A Bill Defining ' Options ' and ' Futures,' and Im-
</p>
<p>posing Special Taxes on Dealers Therein, and for Other Purposes."
</p>
<p>To the Honorable the Senate of the United States:
</p>
<p>Gentlemen :  The New York Produce Exchange received its
</p>
<p>charter from the Legislature of the State of New York in 1S62.
</p>
<p>Some of the purposes of the corporation are therein set forth as
</p>
<p>being " To inculcate just and equitable principles in trade, to
</p>
<p>" establish and maintain uniformity in commercial usage, to ac-
</p>
<p>" quire, preserve and disseminate valuable business information
</p>
<p>" and to adjust controversies and misunderstandings between per-
</p>
<p>" sons engaged in business."
</p>
<p>"We have fulfilled our charter obligations in a manner that has
</p>
<p>obtained for us leadership and influence abroad, and confidence
</p>
<p>and respect at home. Our membership numbers three thousand
</p>
<p>.active, business merchants, among whom are representatives from
</p>
<p>our large financial institutions and managers of all the lines of
</p>
<p>inland and ocean transportation centering in New York. Our
</p>
<p>sessions are held dailj' during the business hours, we are in con-
</p>
<p>tinuous telegraphic contact with the markets of the old and new
</p>
<p>world, and the information thus obtained is free to all our larsre
</p>
<p>constituency.
</p>
<p>"While not entirely confined to, our business is largely in, the
</p>
<p>food products of the United States (both in their original and man-
</p>
<p>ufactured states), and its ramifications extend to the producer on
</p>
<p>the farm and the consumer in both the home and foreign markets.
</p>
<p>In fact it is almost impossible to fix a limit to the influence we
</p>
<p><exert, or say where it is not potently felt.
</p>
<p>Having thus introduced ourselves, we now, in the name of the
</p>
<p>New York Produce Exchange, respectfully but earnestly protest
</p>
<p>.against the enactment of the "Washburn BiU, for the following
</p>
<p>reasons :

</p>
<p>1.  That it seeks to legalize a most pernicious and vicious sys-
</p>
<p>tem of gambling that is demoralizing and degrading, and to the
</p>
<p>operation of which our Exchange has always been opposed.

<p>Al'l'KMnX.
</p>
<p>3.  Tliat it aims to overturn existing conditions that are the
</p>
<p>outcome of careful thought, and sound mercantile judgment
</p>
<p>brought to bear upon old methods that became inoperative, under
</p>
<p>the strain of increasing production, the rapid development of rail-
</p>
<p>road transportation, the more general and prompt transmission
</p>
<p>of business information, and the intense energy of commercial
</p>
<p>enterprise.
</p>
<p>3.  That it seeks to destroy existing benefits that legitimate
</p>
<p>sales for future delivery now confer upon the agriculturist at his
</p>
<p>own door, and through which he reaUzed what may be termed
</p>
<p>" the highest workl price," at the time he desires to sell, less the
</p>
<p>cost of transportation ami a minimum charge by the middlemen
</p>
<p>who stand ready at all times to purchase his products.
</p>
<p>4.  That it would drive to the wall a large army of middlemen,
</p>
<p>as a rule modest merchants of moderate means, but active, earn-
</p>
<p>est, honorable, who are to be found in the smaller towns and vil-
</p>
<p>lages located on the lines of our great railroads, and who have
</p>
<p>done so much to build up their respective neighl)orhoods, and
</p>
<p>bring the commerce of the United States to the magnihcent pro-
</p>
<p>portions that it presents to-day.
</p>
<p>5.  That it is veneered with moral and pliilauthropic pretense
</p>
<p>to hide a selfish purpose, which aims to injure the many for the
</p>
<p>direct benefit of the few.
</p>
<p>First Objection.  The Bill in question, it is proper to state,
</p>
<p>makes a distinction in the meaning of terms which have hereto-
</p>
<p>fore, on our Exchange, been considered synonymous. Sales for
</p>
<p>future delivery have always been dealt in and deemed the estab-
</p>
<p>lished right of buyer and seller whenever the occasion requii'ed
</p>
<p>such transactions, but they did not become a recognized necessity
</p>
<p>for the purposes of protection against loss and for faciHty of oper-
</p>
<p>ation until about the year 1875. Then, because of the raj)idly
</p>
<p>increasing volume of business in farm products, they became more
</p>
<p>general, and for brevity were sometimes called " options," simply

</p>
<p>for the reason that when the period of delivery was arranged to
</p>
<p>suit the convenience of the purchaser, it was called a " buyer's
</p>
<p>option," and vice vei'sa, a " seller's option;" in either case it was
</p>
<p>a transaction similar in all respects to the meaning given to ihe
</p>
<p>term " futures " in the second section of the Bill.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>451
</p>
<p>The meaning given to the term " option " in the first section is
</p>
<p>known to us as a species of gambling called " puts and calls," or
</p>
<p>"privileges," which are transactions opposed to law and good
</p>
<p>morals, and should not be permitted under any circumstances.
</p>
<p>Noticing a growing tendency in some places to tolerate such trad-
</p>
<p>ing, this Exchange adopted a rule in 1SS7 which disciplines any
</p>
<p>member, by public censure, suspension, or expulsion, as the Board
</p>
<p>of Managers should determine, who may be proved guilty of mak-
</p>
<p>ing such trades on the tioor of our Exchange.
</p>
<p>If section one of this Bill suppressed altogether such vicious
</p>
<p>trading, w^e would heartily endorse it, but it is because the proposi-
</p>
<p>tion is to legalize it, and place it on a parity with sales for future
</p>
<p>delivery, that we earnestly protest against it.
</p>
<p>Second Objection.  ''That it aims to overturn existing condi-
</p>
<p>tions," etc. If there is any one element more noteworthy than
</p>
<p>another in advancing what may be termed the "agricultural" or
</p>
<p>farm connnerce" of the United States into the proportions it
</p>
<p>presents to-day it is the facility with wdiich transactions can be
</p>
<p>made with all markets (foreign and domestic) for our surplus farm
</p>
<p>products, through the medium of purchases and sales for future
</p>
<p>delivery. It is impossible to give you the volume or value of
</p>
<p>liome transactions as they are being operated daily in hundreds,
</p>
<p>I might even say thousands, of major and minor markets through-
</p>
<p>out the length and breadth of the land. Such statistics cannot
</p>
<p>be obtained, but from our statistician I have received the declared
</p>
<p>value of the three great articles of commerce that are attacked in
</p>
<p>this bill, viz, breadstuHs, provisions, cotton, which were shipped
</p>
<p>to foreign countries during the year 1S91. They are as follows :
</p>
<p>BreadstufEs 8231,275,709
</p>
<p>Provisions 130,321,693
</p>
<p>Cotton 277,038,511
</p>
<p>Total 8638,635,913
</p>
<p>The total value of all articles exported from the United States

</p>
<p>(specie excepted) during the same period was 8^57,339,705, so
</p>
<p>that you are faced with the grave responsibility of dealing with a
</p>
<p>measm-e that directly afEects not only our enormous home trade,
</p>
<p>452 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>but also almost eighty-one per cent (exact SOj\^) of onr total for-
</p>
<p>eign exports (specie excepted), and all parties who are directly or
</p>
<p>indirectly interested therein.
</p>
<p>Now, we do not hesitate to say (althongh we speak more from
</p>
<p>an experience in breadstuffs and provisions, but our cotton friends
</p>
<p>are present and will please correct us if we are in error) that by
</p>
<p>far the larger j)art of these enormous shipments were purchased
</p>
<p>by the exporter for future delivery, and that before they reached
</p>
<p>the port of ultimate shipment they formed the basis of transac-
</p>
<p>tions for future delivery outside of the exporter, aggregating a
</p>
<p>very much larger amount, every one of which was legitimate and
</p>
<p>mercantile. But this is not all, the vessel service which was re-
</p>
<p>quired to transport all this merchandise to its place of final desti-
</p>
<p>nation was contracted for, to a very great extent, long before the
</p>
<p>vessels sailed for their American ports, and the bills of exchange
</p>
<p>which provided the "ways and means" for payment were also
</p>
<p>largely sold to the dealers in foreign exchange, for future deliv-
</p>
<p>ery. In fact, almost every element in these shipments partook of
</p>
<p>the "future" character, the object being to minimize the risk aris-
</p>
<p>ing from a possible change in market values between the date of
</p>
<p>the original purchase from the producer and arrival at the place
</p>
<p>of consumption.
</p>
<p>We will make a further statement relative to these shipments
</p>
<p>and challenge its contradiction. If the "future" element had
</p>
<p>been eliminated from such transactions, the volume of our ex-
</p>
<p>ports would have been much decreased, and the farmer would
</p>
<p>have received a much less price for the product that he would
</p>
<p>have been able to market, for the reason that under the old regime
</p>
<p>the middlemen, who were generally firms of large wealth,
</p>
<p>required a very much larger percentage of margin against possi-
</p>
<p>ble loss than is required under the present system.
</p>
<p>l!^ow, what is urged in opposition to future sales ? It is said
</p>
<p>that the system is used as a cloak for transactions which some-
</p>
<p>tunes savor more of gambling than of legitimate operations, and

</p>
<p>the assertion is made, that as a large part of the merchandise sold
</p>
<p>for future delivery on our prominent exchanges is never actually
</p>
<p>delivered to the original purchaser, this fact is prima facie evi-
</p>
<p>dence of their illegitimate character. Before answering this
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 45 >
</p>
<p>statement (and it is held to be true, we doubt not, by many -who
</p>
<p>have only superficially examined the subject), permit me to pre-
</p>
<p>sent the form of contract that is required in these future transac-
</p>
<p>tions. It reads as follows:
</p>
<p>GRAIN CONTRACT.
</p>
<p>IS^EW York, February, 1S92.
</p>
<p>In consideration of one dollar in hand paid, the receipt of
</p>
<p>which is hereby acknowledged, I have this day sold to (or hought
</p>
<p>from) Richard Roe, 5,000 bushels of JSTo. 2 wheat, Xew York
</p>
<p>inspection, at 100 cents per bushel of 60 lbs., deliverable at seller's
</p>
<p>(or buyer's) option in May, 1892.
</p>
<p>This contract is made in view of, and in all respects subject to
</p>
<p>the by-laws and rules established by the i^ew York Produce Ex-
</p>
<p>change, in force at this date. John Doe.
</p>
<p>It is concise and definite and in every resjDect legal and bind-
</p>
<p>ing. If either one of the contracting parties desires actual deliv-
</p>
<p>ery under it, it mast be made and there is no power extant that
</p>
<p>can relieve the other from this obligation, or the damage that may
</p>
<p>arise from such non-delivery. It is true, however, that at times a
</p>
<p>large, and during seasons of great activity such as we have just
</p>
<p>been having, a very large proportion of these future transactions
</p>
<p>are not consummated by actual delivery, but this is done by mu-
</p>
<p>tual consent of both parties, and for which an equitable mercan-
</p>
<p>tile equivalent is substituted, simply as a convenience to facilitate
</p>
<p>settlements, which under the old system of actual delivery under
</p>
<p>all cu'cumstances, was f oimd to be cumbersome and attended with
</p>
<p>the loss of valuable time and risk. Take New York, for exam-
</p>
<p>ple. It is a great objective point for mercantile transactions
</p>
<p>made on behalf of parties throughout the old and new world.
</p>
<p>"With such a constituency it continually happens, that the mer-
</p>
<p>chant who sells to-day is a purchaser of the same article to-morrow,
</p>
<p>and in the aggregate of these transactions, it also often happens,
</p>
<p>that a transaction in which he was the buyer, can be matched
</p>
<p>with a subsequent one in which he was the seller of the same de-

</p>
<p>scription of merchandise and for like delivery in all respects
</p>
<p>except as to price, and when this matching does take place diiier-
</p>
<p>ences in value only are paid and the contract closed without going
</p>
<p>thi'ough the forms of delivery and re-delivery with all their at-
</p>
<p>454 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>tendant inconveniences. In such cases, and they are tlie only
</p>
<p>ones where actual delivery does not take place, there would be
</p>
<p>absolutely nothing gained by a strict adherence to the old rule,
</p>
<p>and therefore it was willingly abandoned.
</p>
<p>Perhaps this can be made more evident by citing the bank
</p>
<p>clearing-house system in vogue in all our large cities. By means
</p>
<p>of this system, enormous daily monetary transactions are settled
</p>
<p>in a very few minutes, by the actual interchange of comparatively
</p>
<p>small sums of money. Bank A receives on deposit during the
</p>
<p>day cheques on Bank B to the aggregate of $200,000 and Bank
</p>
<p>B cheques on Bank A to the aggregate of $190,000. The follow-
</p>
<p>ing day tliese banks send their respective claims to the clearing
</p>
<p>house, and that of B is matched against that of A, as far as it will
</p>
<p>go, and the balance paid in cash. In this hypothetical case a
</p>
<p>joint indebtedness of $390,000 was settled by the payment of
</p>
<p>only $10,000 of actual money, and yet every item in the major
</p>
<p>amount was legitimate, nor did the system of settlement employed
</p>
<p>suggest that a single factitious element had entered into the trans-
</p>
<p>action from its inception to its close. It was the growing business
</p>
<p>of the banks that suggested the invention of the clearing-house,
</p>
<p>just as it was the urgent needs of commerce to improve upon the
</p>
<p>old method of actual delivery in every instance and under all cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, that suggested the application of the clearing system,
</p>
<p>when practicable, as a more rapid and convenient means of set-
</p>
<p>tling contract obligations. In like manner the railroad, the steam-
</p>
<p>ship, the telegraph and the telephone, have all been made the
</p>
<p>servants of commerce, and each has contributed its quota in aiding
</p>
<p>her marvelous development, and now all such means are deemed
</p>
<p>absolutely essential adjuncts, which cannot safely be disj)ensed
</p>
<p>with. But even if the charge, "that some illegitimate speculation
</p>
<p>is operated under the cloak of sales for future delivery," is true,
</p>
<p>what then ? Is a great public good to be abrogated because of a
</p>
<p>claimed inability to entirely check a minor defect ? It is as im-
</p>
<p>possible, at all times, to draw the line so definitely that a mercan-

</p>
<p>tile offense of this character cannot be committed, as it is to make
</p>
<p>laws which will absolutely suppress all crime. But (as far as an
</p>
<p>intelligent consideration of the subject can suggest remedies which
</p>
<p>will counteract this injurious influence) you will find our boards
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 455
</p>
<p>'of trade and exchanges have not been idle, and hj rnles and 1j_y-
</p>
<p>laws have controlled these "commercial pirates," to a strict ac-
</p>
<p>countability for their acts. Here is a rule that holds both buyer
</p>
<p>and seller to a money responsibility that they cannot avoid:
</p>
<p>"On all sales or purchases of grain for future delivery either
</p>
<p>party to the contract shall have the right to call an original mar-
</p>
<p>gin of ten cents per Inishel on wheat, rye and barley, and five
</p>
<p>cents per bushel on corn and oats, and a further margin from
</p>
<p>time to time to the extent of any variation in the market value
</p>
<p>from the contract price."
</p>
<p>This rule is both restrictive and protective, and forcibly reminds
</p>
<p>each party entering into future transactions that he must put up
</p>
<p>his money and leave it beyond his control till he has fulfilled his
</p>
<p>obligation, as an evidence of his good intent. It also limits the
</p>
<p>"short seller" to the ability of his pocket to respond to marginal
</p>
<p>calls, and keep the margin good. Now, when it is rememl)ered
</p>
<p>that the "short seller" is operating in the face of a world-wide
</p>
<p>market, it is evident that the moment he gets below legitimate
</p>
<p>values, he will be overwhelmed with purchasers who are always
</p>
<p>on the lookout for bargains and who will insist on the money
</p>
<p>protection under the marginal rule. It is our experience that the
</p>
<p>application of this rule is a most effective check upon the profes-
</p>
<p>sional "short seller." Here is another rule which is equally pro-
</p>
<p>tective, but in another direction, and is given as an evidence of
</p>
<p>the thoughtful care that surrounds all these future transactions :
</p>
<p>"Rule 32.  Sec. 1.  In case any property, contracted for fu-
</p>
<p>ture delivery, be not delivered at maturity of contract, the pur-
</p>
<p>chaser shall notify, in writing, the Committee on Grain, of the
</p>
<p>failure to deliver, and the Committee on Grain shall, at the next
</p>
<p>call, publicly read such notice, and buy in the grain for account
</p>
<p>of the party directing the purchase, but no unreasonable price
</p>
<p>shall be paid, arising from manipulated or fictitious markets, or
</p>
<p>unusual detention in transportation. Any legitimate loss resulting
</p>
<p>to the buyer shall be paid by the party in default and the grain

</p>
<p>so bought shall be a good delivery on defaulted contracts matur-
</p>
<p>ing that day."
</p>
<p>Under this rule the person who aims to operate a "corner" is
</p>
<p>quickly defeated, for a manipulated or fictitious price cannot be
</p>
<p>jenforced.
</p>
<p>iuO APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>These examples could be largely multiplied, but we infer that
</p>
<p>enough has been said to show that the possible evils of future
</p>
<p>sales have been much exaggerated, and that their correction has-
</p>
<p>received, and is continuously receiving, the thoughtful attention
</p>
<p>of honorable, competent men.
</p>
<p>Third and Foukth Objection.  " That it will injure the pro-
</p>
<p>ducer by restricting the range of his market," and " will drive to
</p>
<p>the wall the large army of middlemen " is self-evident and will be
</p>
<p>treated of, doubtless, by the representatives of the boards of trade
</p>
<p>near to the sources of pi'oduction and the homes of those active
</p>
<p>traders, than we in New York, that -I will not occupy your time
</p>
<p>discussing it, further than to say that the absolute success of a
</p>
<p>large part of the business enterprises operated on and though
</p>
<p>our exchange is almost wholly dependent upon the agricultural
</p>
<p>classes, and the person and lirms and elevator associations with
</p>
<p>whom they directly deal. An injury to them conies rapidly home
</p>
<p>to us, and from that standpoint of intimate relationship, we give
</p>
<p>it to you as our deliberate judgment that you could not enact a
</p>
<p>more unfortunate or aggressive law against our common interests,
</p>
<p>than the bill under consideration, which we denounce as ill-advised,,
</p>
<p>illogical, and in its spirit, bad.
</p>
<p>To destroy by legislation the protective element furnished by
</p>
<p>sales for future delivery, is simply to drive a large " produce pur-
</p>
<p>chasing constituency" from the field, and would prove so dis-
</p>
<p>astrous to the agricultural classes that upon the first opportunity
</p>
<p>after they realized its injurious effect, they would relegate the
</p>
<p>legislator who advocated and enacted it into political oblivion.
</p>
<p>Fifth Objection.  "It is veneered with moral and philanthropic-
</p>
<p>pretense," etc.
</p>
<p>In making this assertion we have simply stated our belief with
</p>
<p>the view of putting you on your guard, and inducing critical
</p>
<p>examination into motives, before reaching a conclusion. In seek-
</p>
<p>ing a reason for the introduction of this objectionable measure
</p>
<p>into Congress, we soon found to our satisfaction (that while ignor-

</p>
<p>ance of the whole subject and a laudable desire to shield the
</p>
<p>agriculturist from the " raids " of the " short seller," and the com-
</p>
<p>munity at large from the efforts of the " corner " monger to give
</p>
<p>to food products an exaggerated value, had something to do with
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 457'
</p>
<p>it) the more dangerous element was cloaked imder the cry " that
</p>
<p>it was morally wrong to sell what was not actually held in hand."
</p>
<p>The authors of this foolish platitude, while posing as the " farm-
</p>
<p>er's friend," are nothing short of his worst enemies. Their aim
</p>
<p>is to deprive him of his " world-wide market " by driving off
</p>
<p>competition through legislative aid, and thus having corralled him
</p>
<p>into the narrow limits prescribed in this bill, purchase his pro-
</p>
<p>ducts at their own time and price.
</p>
<p>Many expedients have heretofore been resorted to, to induce
</p>
<p>the holding back of farm products from the ordinary channels
</p>
<p>of commerce (particularly in- the Northwest) and failed, and now
</p>
<p>as a last effort the Congress of the United States is unblushingly
</p>
<p>asked, under the plea of needed revenue legislation, to tax out of
</p>
<p>existence a mercantile right that is in every way lawful and never
</p>
<p>before questioned, and has proved of incalculable benefit to the
</p>
<p>commercial interests of the whole country.
</p>
<p>Permit us to call your attention to the peculiar wording of this
</p>
<p>bill, and especially to the bracketed words in the second section,
</p>
<p>reading as follows: "or unless the articles so contracted to be
</p>
<p>" sold and delivered shall subsequently be actually delivered to
</p>
<p>" the purchaser for manufacture or consumption.") In other
</p>
<p>words, a miller can purchase wheat for delivery from anyone who
</p>
<p>wishes to sell, whether he has it in hand or not, without the tax
</p>
<p>being operative on either party, provided it is delivered to the
</p>
<p>said miller for manufacture. A merchant or exporter cannot
</p>
<p>make such a purchase, because he is neither a manufacturer nor a
</p>
<p>consumer under this law, therefore the man who wishes to sell
</p>
<p>wheat for future delivery, without incurring the tax, which he
</p>
<p>has not actually in hand, has only the one class of customers, and
</p>
<p>they are the privileged millers.
</p>
<p>Now please examine the third section and you will notice that
</p>
<p>while all the products of the hog are made subject to the proposed
</p>
<p>tax, the product of wheat (flour) is not mentioned. Here again
</p>
<p>the miller is made the favored son of legislation. This may be

<p>the result of accident and not design, but when taken in connec-
</p>
<p>tion with the fact that the exports of flour from the United States
</p>
<p>during 1891 amounted to the value of $64,783,861 and that it
</p>
<p>was largely dealt in for future delivery, exactly as wheat, corn,^

</p>
<p>provisions and the other articles mentioned in the hill as snhjeet
</p>
<p>to tax are, some idea may l)e formed of the immense advantage
</p>
<p>the pro])osed legislation would give to the large milling interest
</p>
<p>of the Northwest.
</p>
<p>For these reasons we think wc are justified in characterizing
</p>
<p>the measure as "hiding a selfish purpose which aims to injure the
</p>
<p>many for the direct benefit of the few."
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, one word more and I have done. The United
</p>
<p>States is eminently a commercial country, and through her com-
</p>
<p>merce, backed up as it is by agricultural, mineral, mechanical and
</p>
<p>,S3ientific development, is rapidly becoming the wealthiest of all
</p>
<p>the countries of the world.
</p>
<p>Let me call your attention to this fact, which, while we do not
</p>
<p>claim it as a result, we have a right to say of it that it is a coinci-
</p>
<p>dence. Buying and selling for future delivery (although always
</p>
<p>more or less operated as now carried on) became the rule with the
</p>
<p>American merchant about the year 1875. Since that period
</p>
<p>(hecause of its protective element) it has 1>een adoi)ted by every
</p>
<p>European country with whom we trade, and it is found to give
</p>
<p>every satisfaction. For the seventeen years prior to 1875 the
</p>
<p>balance of trade against this country aggregated in round num-
</p>
<p>bers $1,200,000,000. Since that period, which is also seventeen
</p>
<p>years, the balance of trade 2W favor of this country aggregates in
</p>
<p>round numbers the enormous sum of $1,825,000,000, of which
</p>
<p>amount $155,500,000 was for the year 1891. Do not these figures
</p>
<p>speak volumes for the men who hold the helm of commercial
</p>
<p>enterprise in the United States, and are not their views on com-
</p>
<p>mercial subjects entitled to consideration and respect ?
</p>
<p>We do not come here as suppliants, but ask for, in the firm
</p>
<p>hope of receiving, recognition for what we have done, and are
</p>
<p>doing, in forcing the country to the front. There is no egotism
</p>
<p>in our claim that the American merchant stands out as the central
</p>
<p>ligure in our national development. He is as necessary to the
</p>
<p>ao-riculturist in obtaining the largest money value for his labor, as

<p>he is to his government to whom he contributes the major part of
</p>
<p>the revenues which it receives. He is the patron of the railroad,
</p>
<p>the steamship, and the wonderful discoveries of science, whose
</p>
<p>inventions he quickly adapts to the more rapid and economic
</p>

</p>
<p>requirements of his business. He is the friend, and to a great
</p>
<p>extent the supporter, of the professions and contributes largely to
</p>
<p>education, literature and the arts and every other reiininff influ-
</p>
<p>ence that creates and furthers social happiness. It is consistent,
</p>
<p>therefore, that we should ask for, and you grant the fostering
</p>
<p>care of legislation to commercial enterprise, and that the great
</p>
<p>mercantile associations throughout the land, who are more directly
</p>
<p>responsible for the outcome and who are continually alive to the
</p>
<p>changes that are of necessity always taking place, are the best able
</p>
<p>to detect injurious influences as tiiey arise and to suggest to legis-
</p>
<p>lative bodies the needed remedies.
