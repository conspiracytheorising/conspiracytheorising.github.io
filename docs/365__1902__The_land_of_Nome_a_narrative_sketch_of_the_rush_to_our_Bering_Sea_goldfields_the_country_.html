</p>
<p>A FTER returning from his first ex-
</p>
<p>JLjL perience in Alaska in 1900, the
</p>
<p>author was prompted to write from his
</p>
<p>diary, primarily for his friends, a sketch
</p>
<p>of the rush to the Cape Nome gold-fields
</p>
<p>and the character of the country and its
</p>
<p>people. This account, with some modifi-
</p>
<p>cations, forms the first half of this book.
</p>
<p>The second half, parts of which were
</p>
<p>written in the atmosphere of the situations
</p>
<p>as they arose during the following year,
</p>
<p>has been recently completed upon the ad-
</p>
<p>judication of the United States Circuit
</p>
<p>Court of Appeals for the Pacific Coast,
</p>
<p>which, in effect, finally frees north-

</p>
<p>The writer believes that the discovery

<p>of this El Dorado of Bering Sea has
</p>
<p>created an epoch in the development of
</p>
<p>our national domain, wonderful and un-
</p>
<p>precedented in various phases, and but
</p>
<p>little understood or appreciated by the
</p>
<p>general public. Because of its unique-
</p>
<p>ness, it is a difficult matter to treat ade-
</p>
<p>quately. Certain features of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject can hardly be exaggerated; for in-
</p>
<p>stance: the magnitude and blindness of
</p>
<p>the stampede of eighteen thousand for-
</p>
<p>tune-hunters in the summer of 1900, and
</p>
<p>the almost indescribable scenes which
</p>
<p>attended their arrival on the " golden

<p>of the placer-gold deposits; the dreari-

</p>
<p>gold at Cape Nome, Alaska,
</p>
<p>situated almost in the Bering
</p>
<p>Strait, only one hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty miles from Siberia, and distant not
</p>
<p>less than three thousand miles from San
</p>
<p>Francisco and fifteen hundred from the
</p>
<p>famed Klondike, naturally created more
</p>
<p>excitement in the Western and mining
</p>
<p>sections of this country than in the Middle
</p>
<p>States and the " effete East," an expres-
</p>
<p>sion frequently heard in the West. These
</p>
<p>rich placer-gold deposits were discovered

<p>THE LAND OF NOME
</p>
<p>autumn of 1898. The news spread like
</p>
<p>wild-fire down along the Pacific coast and
</p>
<p>up into Dawson and the Klondike country,
</p>
<p>and the following spring witnessed a
</p>
<p>stampede to the new El Dorado, which,
</p>
<p>however, was wholly eclipsed by the un-
</p>
<p>precedented mad rush of eighteen thou-
</p>
<p>sand persons in the spring ensuing. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing the summer months of 1899, when,
</p>
<p>in addition to the gold along the creeks,
</p>
<p>rich deposits, easy to extract, were found
</p>
<p>in the beach extending for miles by the
</p>
<p>sea, every one at Nome had an opportu-
</p>
<p>nity to share in nature's unexpected gift.
</p>
<p>Consequently, upon the return in the fall,
</p>
<p>the story of the wonderful wealth of this
</p>
<p>weird country was circulated broadcast.
</p>
<p>All kinds of schemes, honest and dishon-
</p>
<p>est, were devised during the winter to
</p>
<p>obtain the gold the following season, and

<p>THE RUSH m 1900
</p>
<p>the matter of providing suitable laws to
</p>
<p>meet the many difficult conditions and
</p>
<p>questions which had already arisen, and
</p>
<p>which would be greatly aggravated by
</p>
<p>the threatened and succeeding stampede,
</p>
<p>came definitely before Congress. Alaska,
</p>
<p>legally, is not even a Territory, though
</p>
<p>commonly so called. It is the District of
</p>
<p>Alaska, possessing a governor and other
</p>
<p>officers, but, unlike a Territory, no leg-
</p>
<p>islature; and it is, therefore, entirely de-
</p>
<p>pendent upon Congress for all legislation.
</p>
<p>The Alaska bill, under the charge of Mr.
</p>
<p>Warner in the House and Senator Carter
</p>
<p>in the Senate, consumed a great deal of
</p>
<p>the time of Congress; many of its provi-
</p>
<p>sions were hotly debated, and finally it be-
</p>
<p>came a law, June 6, 1900  in the main a
</p>
<p>satisfactory piece of legislation. By it
</p>
<p>Alaska was divided into three judicial

<p>THE LAND OF NOME
</p>
<p>divisions, and that which embraces north-
</p>
<p>western Alaska and the new gold-fields
</p>
<p>was allotted to Arthur H. Noyes of Min-
</p>
<p>nesota, formerly of Dakota. If ever a
</p>
<p>position demanded an honest, able, and
</p>
<p>fearless man, it was this judgeship, which
</p>
<p>should be the guaranty of good civil gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, establish a court, and disentangle
</p>
<p>and dispose of, among a mixed population
</p>
<p>largely composed of unscrupulous ele-
</p>
<p>ments, an indescribable mass of legal
</p>
<p>matters, already accumulated and ever
</p>
<p>increasing.
</p>
<p>When in Washington in the winter of
</p>
<p>1899, 1 became interested in Cape Nome.
</p>
<p>I met there an able young attorney from
</p>
<p>the Pacific coast, who among the first
</p>
<p>had gone to Nome, where he had prac-
</p>
<p>tised his profession with great success

<p>and secured interests in some promising

</p>
<p>properties. He was then in Washington
</p>
<p>in the interest of Alaskan legislation.
</p>
<p>The prospects for great legal complica-
</p>
<p>tions in the new country were highly
</p>
<p>encouraging. Lieutenant Jarvis of the
</p>
<p>United States revenue service, a man of
</p>
<p>sound judgment and few words, who so
</p>
<p>signally distinguished himself in 1897 by
</p>
<p>his overland expedition and rescue of the
</p>
<p>crews of whaling-vessels ice-bound in the
</p>
<p>Arctic seas, had been the chief agent of
</p>
<p>the government at ]S"ome the preceding
</p>
<p>year. He not only corroborated what I
</p>
<p>had already heard, but gave the impres-
</p>
<p>sion that the story had not half been told.
</p>
<p>My brother and I decided to make the
</p>
<p>venture, and to be content with a safe
</p>
<p>return and a fund of experience, to offset
</p>
<p>the uncertain rewards of business and
</p>
<p>law practice during the dull summer

<p>months. He took up surveying, and I
</p>
<p>spent all my spare time in studying the
</p>
<p>elaborate codes of laws which Congress
</p>
<p>was then enacting for Alaska, as well as
</p>
<p>substantive mining law and all available
</p>
<p>information pertaining to that little known
</p>
<p>or understood country.
</p>
<p>In San Francisco there were many
</p>
<p>signs of the Nome excitement. "Cape
</p>
<p>!N^ome Supplies," in large print, met the
</p>
<p>eye frequently. One ran across many
</p>
<p>who were going, and heard of many more
</p>
<p>who had already started for the Arctic
</p>
<p>gold-fields. All indications pointed to
</p>
<p>the advent of a small army of lawyers
</p>
<p>and doctors on the shores of Nome. But,
</p>
<p>though there was a stir in the atmosphere,
</p>
<p>the excitement was nothing compared
</p>
<p>with that at Seattle, which is the natural
</p>
<p>outfitting-point for Alaska; for San

<p>Francisco has had a long experience in

<p>these " excitements," and treats each re-

<p>probably emanating from the Siberian

<p>upon the beach. One of professed large

<p>experience vehemently maintained that

<p>his theory of the beach deposits was the

<p>correct one; that is to say, the gold
</p>
<p>came down the Yukon Kiver attached

<p>to the bottom of icebergs which were

<p>carried out to sea, and then, somehow,

<p>through the kindness of the Japanese

<p>deposited upon the long-extending beach

<p>at Cape Nome! Of course, as had been

<p>clearly demonstrated in the preliminary

<p>gold had been carried down from the in-

<p>Adventurous, she had taken advantage of
</p>
<p>a lucky break in the ice, and had safely
</p>
<p>gotten through and reached her destina-

</p>
<p>seeking interviews with those returning
</p>
<p>on the Cleveland. The latter were, for
</p>
<p>the most part, a poor-looking collection,
</p>
<p>who told dire and terrible tales of the
</p>
<p>Nome "fake" and of the lawlessness
</p>
<p>and crime existing there. They said that
</p>
<p>the beach had been exhausted of its gold,
</p>
<p>and that people were leaving for home as
</p>
<p>quickly as the steamers would take them
</p>
<p>or they could scrape up enough money
</p>
<p>to pay their passage. To those especially
</p>
<p>who were relying upon getting ready
</p>
<p>money from the beach this news was not
</p>
<p>reassuring.

<p>sometimes very close to the ship, and we

<p>occasionally skirted around fields of ice.
</p>
<p>A matter about which we particularly

<p>wished to know, and regarding which
</p>
<p>the testimony of experts was sharply
</p>
<p>conflicting, was just what kind of a cli-
</p>
<p>mate is that of the Nome country. Some
</p>
<p>said that it was chilly and that it rained
</p>
<p>all the while, and that rubber boots and

<p>oilskins were always essential; a former

<p>]Srew Bedford, said that frequently dur-

<p>ing the middle of the day the sun was so

<p>hot as to be almost unbearable. But as

<p>to knowing anything at that time, the

<p>the cry of encouragement to the dogs of

<p>that of sanitary conditions, or rather the

<p>disease had, nevertheless, secured a foot-

<p>and there were probably more deaths from

<p>numerous. A repetition was thus hap-

<p>our boat could have held all om^ freight,

<p>cover a route which would afford the

<p>they were making ready their packs for
</p>
<p>the " mush " to the auxiliary creeks above,
</p>
<p>where they thought the richer deposits

<p>were. All had to admit that it was an
</p>
<p>auriferous country, that "colors" could

<p>be found everywhere along the creeks,
</p>
<p>but the question was, and always is. Will

<p>a mining claim which undoubtedly con-

<p>tains a fortune in gold, but the unfor-

<p>tunate fact remains that it will cost him
</p>
<p>more money to get the gold from the

<p>ground than the value of the gold which
</p>
<p>is in it. All agreed, however, that this
</p>
<p>looked something more like "God's coun-

<p>of the many kind and generous acts of

<p>After singling out the least humpy

<p>giving the sun a good chance at this

<p>trouble irremediable. Two large tents, one
</p>
<p>made to open into the other, were used,
</p>
<p>respectively, to sleep and to cook and eat
</p>
<p>in, and near the side of this oblong ar-
</p>
<p>rangement was erected the " office " tent.
</p>
<p>A bunk put together and a folding cot,

<p>picked up at Chenik, kept us off the

<p>the population of the place, but their

<p>Very soon, and in no modest fashion,
</p>
<p>the signs "Attorneys at Law" and "Sur-

<p>veyors" were flashed upon the pub-
</p>
<p>lic. There were two other lawyers at

<p>came at once necessary to examine the min-

<p>her face was both refined and strong.

<p>Some of Bret Harte's characters were

<p>A few words concerning mining law

<p>to fraud and blackmail, such as exist

<p>galore in Alaska, and which could not

<p>be practised under the carefully drawn

<p>timber is very scarce, and the original

<p>Claims which border upon and include

<p>sections of the present streams, greatly

<p>reduced in size, are known as " creek "

<p>to be the richest. There is on every

<p>Those claims which are located farther

<p>and are known frequently by the name

<p>of the wife or daughter of the miner, or
</p>
<p>by any fanciful designation. It was this

<p>latter class of claims which, up to that

<p>time ignored or overlooked, m the mid-

<p>THE LAND OF NOME
</p>
<p>After a certain number of hours' "run,"
</p>
<p>the water is temporarily diverted, and the
</p>
<p>"clean-up" takes place; that is, the
</p>
<p>sluice-boxes are cleaned out, and the
</p>
<p>gold separated from the black sand and
</p>
<p>iron substances which usually remain
</p>
<p>with it. Water, therefore, is absolutely
</p>
<p>essential. In 1900, at first, the general
</p>
<p>complaint was "no water," although
</p>
<p>later, when the heavy rains came, it was
</p>
<p>"too much water." Placer-mining is a
</p>
<p>delicate and uncertain business, and is
</p>
<p>very hard work. Gold is not "picked
</p>
<p>up" anywhere, and mother earth yields
</p>
<p>her treasure very stubbornly. The gold
</p>
<p>of this country consists mainly of fine
</p>
<p>particles or " dust," and, compared with
</p>
<p>the Klondike, but few nuggets are found.
</p>
<p>It is, however, purer than the Klondike
</p>
<p>gold, and assays higher.

<p>cil F 5 whom we had known on the

</p>
<p>old, but financial stress had compelled

<p>him to leave his university prematurely;
</p>
<p>and he had been among the first to cross
</p>
<p>the Chilkoot Pass and undergo the rigors
</p>
<p>of the Klondike. Late in the season of
</p>
<p>1899 he had come from the Klondike to
</p>
<p>Nome, and had acquired, as he believed,
</p>
<p>some valuable interests there, which he
</p>
<p>had been obliged to intrust to a partner, as
</p>
<p>he was carried out from Nome in the fall
</p>
<p>more dead than alive with typhoid. Re-
</p>
<p>turning the next year, he learned that his

<p>partner had robbed hun, and that all that

<p>remained was this dog. So, with his pack

<p>of course, in the open air and upon the

<p>ground,  in quest of employment on one

<p>of the Wild Goose properties, " JSTo. 15

<p>looking fellow. He dined with us, and

<p>we extended to him the hospitality of our

<p>the nights begin to darken. After the

<p>middle of August they became quite

<p>About September 1, a heavy storm with
</p>
<p>a driving rain set in, which continued
</p>
<p>with no moderation until the 8th of the
</p>
<p>month. Dams were washed away, and

<p>times impossible that the tents could stand
</p>
<p>up against the wind, or that the canvas
</p>
<p>could longer keep out the heavy rain.
</p>
<p>The " boulevards " of Council were in a
</p>
<p>very sorry condition. It was very dismal
</p>
<p>comfort those days. The ^euMuk had
</p>
<p>become a young Mississippi, and the bar
</p>
<p>of the stream was now entirely covered.
</p>
<p>The wind blew furiously up the stream ;
</p>
<p>and it was almost an unbelievable sight
</p>
<p>to behold one day a freighter sailing
</p>
<p>slowly and surely, impelled alone by the
</p>
<p>favoring wind, up the stream and over
</p>
<p>that riffle which hitherto had been the
</p>
<p>heartbreaker.

<p>In view of this storm and the early
</p>
<p>approaching winter, the mining season
</p>
<p>seemed to have ended, and we decided to
</p>
<p>quit for Nome and home on the next fa-
</p>
<p>vorable day, and began to make ready
</p>
<p>accordingly. C had decided that he
</p>
<p>would spend the winter at Council, and I
</p>
<p>determined to return in the following
</p>
<p>spring. A very good log cabin, nearing
</p>
<p>completion, which Avould answer for
</p>
<p>C 's residence and the firm's office,
</p>
<p>was leased, and the bulk of our general

<p>outfit moved into it. It was economy for
</p>
<p>C to come with us to ISTome to lay
</p>
<p>in his winter supplies. Sugar was sell-
</p>

<p>the Mush-on at half-past seven o'clock.

<p>How different it was from coming up!

<p>The boat seemed at times fairly to fly
</p>
<p>along, borne by the current and assisted
</p>
<p>by the oars. At a sudden turn we were

<p>hailed by some freighters, and later by

<p>the Arctic Bird^ which, taking advan-
</p>
<p>tage of the sudden rise of the streams,
</p>
<p>was bringing up some heavy machinery.
</p>
<p>The former handed over to us some home
</p>
<p>letters, and a batch of mail from the lat-
</p>
<p>ter, well protected, was thrown at us
</p>
<p>and picked up safely out of the river.
</p>
<p>This mail added to the general gaiety of

<p>the situation. At half-past twelve a short
</p>
<p>stop was made at White Mountain to pay

<p>our respects to friends there; and then

</p>
<p>With the knowledge that the Circuit
</p>
<p>Court of Appeals was back of them, the
</p>
<p>Wild Goose people took possession of
</p>
<p>their mines. McKenzie, acting under the

<p>kind of legal advice that he wanted, main-

<p>tained that the writs were irregular and

<p>void, and absolutely refused to deliver up

<p>The next step, therefore, was to proceed

<p>against McKenzie for contempt of court.

<p>The time was very short; for communi-

<p>to sea or sought for shelter the lee of

<p>Sledge Island, to the northwest, and the

<p>shore was fast becoming a scene of
</p>
<p>wreckage indescribable. Tugs, lighters,

<p>floating piers, and all small craft lay
</p>
<p>tossed upon the beach. The sea was

<p>rising higher all the time, and soon build-

<p>and lower part of the town were under

<p>upon the beach was buried in the sand.

<p>The entire sand-spit where we had first

<p>five or six hundred miles to the south,

<p>they had joined a party and gone thither

<p>in the small sailing-schooner which now

<p>lay high and dry upon the beach. Caught

<p>by storms either way, their experiences
</p>
<p>were of the hair-raising order, and it was

<p>only through the great skill and coolness

<p>brought to us a splendid pair of their

<p>THE LAKD OF NOME

<p>I remember also two big, husky, good-
</p>
<p>looking miners, who used to interrogate
</p>
<p>me about getting up the streams to and
</p>
<p>above Council City. They had a griev-
</p>
<p>ance against their "disagreeable" cabin-
</p>
<p>mate. This was a Swedish missionary;
</p>
<p>and the complaint was made not because
</p>
<p>he was so " damned religious," but be-
</p>
<p>cause he was unsociable  would n't

<p>enter into the spirit of things. For in-
</p>
<p>stance, when asked whether he was going
</p>
<p>to Nome, his only reply was that his
</p>
<p>ticket didn't read that way. Perhaps
</p>
<p>the missionary was canny in not allowing
</p>
<p>his room-mates too much leeway. And
</p>
<p>there were others.
</p>
<p>As we approached the now familiar

<p>bold and bleak topography of Unalaska,

<p>it was apparent that the rumors of late

<p>ice in Bering Sea were well founded.

<p>The hills and slopes bore a good deal

<p>more snow than a year ago, and the at-

<p>mosphere was more chill. There re-

<p>mained in the harbor but few vessels.

<p>The majority of the fleet had already
</p>
<p>forged into Bering Sea; but the Jeannie^
</p>
<p>a steam- whaler, specially fitted to " buck "
</p>
<p>the ice, was the only vessel known to
</p>
<p>have discharged its passengers and freight
</p>
<p>at ]N'ome. This had been accomplished
</p>
<p>on the ice, during the latter part of May,
</p>
<p>two miles from the beach, the freight at
</p>
<p>great expense having been transferred
</p>
<p>ashore by dog-teams. We remained at

<p>very pretty to look at, but frequently

</p>
<p>dangerous cakes that lurked beneath.
</p>
<p>Strange birds, somewhat smaller than
</p>
<p>penguins, sitting up stiffly and absurdly
</p>
<p>on their tails, marshaled themselves in
</p>
<p>military rows upon the ice, and occasion-
</p>
<p>ally a seal poked up its snaky and in-
</p>
<p>quiring head from beneath the still wa-
</p>
<p>ters. The sea was mirror-like. Some-
</p>
<p>times, intensified by the fog and mist
</p>
<p>which hung about, the sun shone down
</p>
<p>hot, as the vessel crept slowly through
</p>
<p>the haze and maze of her uncanny sur-
</p>
<p>roundings. It was a strange, weird scene,
</p>
<p>recalling the " Rime of the Ancient Mari-

<p>melting ice, the contact causing the red
</p>
<p>paint to gush to the surface, a bright
</p>
<p>Irishman in the steerage temporarily re-
</p>
<p>lieved the monotony by shouting out,
</p>
<p>" She bleeds at the nose."
</p>
<p>And it was becoming very monotonous.
</p>
<p>It was then June 22, and with fair con-
</p>
<p>ditions we should have been at Nome
</p>
<p>two days earlier. Passengers became
</p>
<p>uneasy or disgusted, and many expressed
</p>
<p>themselves to the effect that our excel-
</p>
<p>lent captain did n't Imow his business, 
</p>
<p>that we were lost, and would likely have to
</p>
<p>remain thus a month more,  and they were
</p>
<p>for " butting right through " the ice any-

<p>in the day, however, icy and uninviting
</p>
<p>l^Tunivak Island appeared close at hand,
</p>
<p>some four hundred miles south of IS'ome,
</p>
<p>and we then knew where we were. Pass-

<p>ing at half speed along it, at what seemed
</p>
<p>a safe distance, suddenly there was a
</p>
<p>bump, followed almost immediately by a
</p>
<p>reversal of the engines, a churning of
</p>
<p>mud and eighteen feet of water, and fran-
</p>
<p>tic efforts to get off a treacherous mud-
</p>
<p>flat. This seemed the last straw, but the
</p>
<p>quick action of our engineer saved the
</p>
<p>day and a very dismal prospect. It was
</p>
<p>near this same island that the Lane^ our

<p>her way "down below" (]N'ome lingo

<p>with sails up, when the vessel struck
</p>
<p>with a mighty jar and became a total
</p>
<p>loss. The few passengers and the crew
</p>
<p>were all saved, as they needed only to
</p>
<p>step off upon the shore.
</p>
<p>The 8L Paul anchored that night in
</p>
<p>deeper water and a dense fog. During
</p>
<p>the night fog-horns were heard in the
</p>
<p>distance, and a series of exchanges fol-
</p>
<p>lowed in order that the approaching ves-
</p>
<p>sel might locate us. In the morning the
</p>
<p>Senator^ a sister ship, loomed up out of
</p>
<p>the fog, not a hundred yards distant.
</p>
<p>The captains held a shouting conversa-
</p>
<p>tion, and, instead of being a companion
</p>
<p>in misery, we learned that the Senator
</p>
<p>had already discharged passengers and

<p>freight at Nome, and was now on her

</p>
<p>Now knowing the course, and the
</p>
<p>wind having shifted the ice, we pushed
</p>
<p>ahead through the fog; and in the clear
</p>
<p>light of the afternoon of June 24 the
</p>
<p>unforgetable scenery of Nome presented
</p>
<p>itself, whiter on the back-lying hills and
</p>
<p>less inviting than a year ago. Mining
</p>
<p>men eyed it seriously; for it looked as if
</p>
<p>the terrible winter were lingering in the
</p>
<p>lap of spring, which meant that the (at
</p>
<p>best) scant four months' working season
</p>
<p>might be materially curtailed. And this
</p>
<p>seemed the more probable when scores
</p>
<p>of dories came out and clustered about
</p>
<p>the ship, their idle owners offering for a
</p>
<p>consideration to carry passengers ashore.
</p>
<p>It was hard to realize that one was back
</p>
<p>again at this jumping-off place of the

<p>world, having meantime covered so great

<p>rid of people, remained that night unmo-

</p>
<p>Well, then, in the morning, seated on
</p>
<p>a load of freight and baggage, the rest
</p>
<p>of the passengers, in a misty rain, trav-
</p>
<p>ersed the intervening two miles of then
</p>
<p>smooth water, and deposited themselves
</p>
<p>and their hand-baggage upon the famous,

<p>and infamous, shores of Nome. The

<p>covered by dead dogs and refuse, but

<p>the past, was that of the "Gold Belt

<p>Dance Hall."
</p>
<p>While A guarded the baggage,
</p>
<p>W and I went in search of a tempo-
</p>
<p>rary abiding-place, and decided in favor
</p>
<p>of an unfurnished room at the Gold Hill

<p>Hotel, situated in a less crowded part of
</p>
<p>the town. Into this we soon placed
</p>
<p>our folding cots, blankets, and personal

<p>effects; and as the bar immediately un-
</p>
<p>derneath us was not then doing a land-
</p>
<p>office business, we considered ourselves
</p>
<p>lucky to be so well settled thus soon.
</p>
<p>The sea, fortunately, was sufficiently calm
</p>
<p>to permit discharging the freight, which
</p>
<p>was well cared for and put under cover

<p>by the reliable Alaska Commercial Com-

<p>The next object of concern, after hav-

<p>termine whether one conld then proceed

</p>
<p>soon forced upon me that I should have
</p>
<p>to remain as cheerfully as possible in

<p>Nome until Golovin Bay should be clear

<p>of ice. Several attempts had already
</p>
<p>been made to effect an entrance there, but

<p>without success. Assuredly it was a late

<p>season. It was still impossible for ves-

<p>creeks were yet filled with ice and snow,
</p>
<p>so as to allow only preliminary operations
</p>
<p>for mining, or none at all. The prospect
</p>
<p>was made more dismal by the stormy and

<p>cold rainy weather which then prevailed.

<p>The gale wrecked several small craft and

<p>caused the remaining steamers to put

<p>it was necessary to pole over a slough or

<p>cross the stream. The recent freshets

</p>
<p>Not long after my arrival, a good fel-
</p>
<p>low named Joe Brennan, while bringing
</p>
<p>his horses and freight up the rivers, was
</p>
<p>drowned some ten miles below Council.
</p>
<p>It was believed that he was swimming a
</p>
<p>horse, and that when the animal climbed
</p>
<p>the bank, Brennan fell off and, his boots
</p>
<p>filling, drowned. When the body was
</p>
<p>recovered, a few days later, it was brought
</p>
<p>to Council, a coroner's inquest held,
</p>
<p>and then decently buried. Northwestern
</p>
<p>Alaska furnishes excellent graveyards,
</p>
<p>rivaling the art of ancient Egypt. Its
</p>
<p>ground will preserve a man forever, but
</p>
<p>it is a long way for his friends and rela-
</p>
<p>tives to come to see him. A small
</p>
<p>amount of currency was found on Bren-
</p>
<p>nan; a poke of dust with which he
</p>
<p>was to execute certain commissions was
</p>
<p>identified and returned to its owner; but

<p>a considerable sum of money of his own,

<p>with which he was known to have left

<p>had been robbed. But there are lots of

<p>polite, well-educated son of old England.

<p>But my hopes that he might appear in the

<p>latter condition were blasted when, in re-

<p>sponse to a shuffling and a bang at the

<p>through the records to ascertain, first,

<p>and of course it becomes a nice question

<p>of evidence as to who has the right time.
</p>
<p>The case in point certainly had not been

<p>lacking in dramatic incident. Welch and

<p>Ripley found others on the ground for

<p>whom no love was lost. It was not a

<p>was done, and Ripley, so he said, re-

<p>strained old Tom from putting a bullet

<p>into a certain miscreant. But it was hard

<p>work to confine the enthusiastic Ripley

<p>he was, nevertheless, noted for his ener-

<p>qualities which go to make a good miner
</p>
<p>are, perhaps, generally underestimated.
</p>
<p>He must, primarily, be a man of intelli-

<p>gineer for turning a creek, constructing

<p>ditches, building dams, and meeting the

<p>exigencies of the situation. He must

<p>know formation,  understand geology, 
</p>
<p>in order to locate the pay streak and oper-
</p>
<p>ate it successfully. And he must know
</p>
<p>how to manage men. These qualities
</p>
<p>Shaw combined. For instance : The labor
</p>
<p>is divided into two ten-hour shifts, the
</p>
<p>day shift and the night shift, and not in-

<p>when the hollow shout of the news-ven-

<p>siderably lessened the pleasure of home-

<p>I elbowed my way through the camera

</p>
<p>which weighed ninety-seven ounces, or a

<p>little over eight pounds (troy), and was

<p>worth $1552. I have been informed that

<p>another nugget, slightly larger, was dis-

</p>
<p>tempt cases of Arthur H. Noyes, C. A. S.
</p>
<p>Frost, Thomas J. Geary, and Joseph K.
</p>
<p>Wood. The opinion of the court was de-

<p>livered by Judge Gilbert, and there are

<p>concurring opinions by Judges Ross and

<p>Noyes's sentence consists of a mere fine
</p>
<p>of one thousand dollars. As to Geary,
</p>
<p>the lawyer, the court states that there is
</p>
<p>not sufficient evidence to convince it be-
</p>
<p>yond a reasonable doubt that he was
</p>
<p>guilty of contempt, and the charge against
</p>
<p>him is dismissed. Wood, the district

<p>attorney, is adjudged guilty, and is sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to four months' imprisonment in
</p>
<p>the county jail of Alameda County, Cali-

<p>Department of Justice, who (as the evi-
</p>
<p>dence discloses), soon after his arrival at
</p>
<p>ISTome, became an assistant district attor-
</p>
<p>ney, and, later. Judge Noyes's private
</p>
<p>secretary, and who spent government
</p>
<p>money in behalf of the conspirators, is

<p>likewise found guilty of contempt of

</p>
<p>Judge Eoss in his concurring opinion
</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>"I am of the opinion that the records
</p>
<p>and evidence in the cases show beyond
</p>
<p>any reasonable doubt that the circum-
</p>
<p>stances under which and the purposes for
</p>
<p>wliich each of those persons committed
</p>
<p>the contempt alleged and so found were
</p>
<p>far graver than is indicated in the opinion
</p>
<p>of the court, and that the punishment
</p>
<p>awarded by the court is wholly inade-
</p>
<p>quate to the gravity of the offenses. I
</p>
<p>think the records and evidence show
</p>
<p>very clearly that the contempts of Judge
</p>
<p>I^oyes and Frost were committed in pur-
</p>
<p>suance of a corrupt conspiracy with Alex-
</p>

<p>opinion, among other properties, were to
</p>
<p>be wrongfully taken, under the forms of
</p>
<p>law, from the possession of those engaged
</p>
<p>in mining them, and the proceeds thereof
</p>
<p>appropriated by the conspirators. For
</p>
<p>those shocking offenses it is apparent
</p>
<p>that no punishment that can be lawfully
</p>
<p>imposed in a contempt proceeding is ade-
</p>
<p>quate. But a reasonable imprisonment
</p>
<p>may be here imposed, and I am of the
</p>
<p>opinion that, in the case of the respondent
</p>
<p>Arthur H. l^oyes, a judgment of impris-
</p>
<p>onment in a county jail for the period of
</p>
<p>eighteen months should be imposed, and
</p>
<p>in the case of Frost a like imprisonment
</p>
<p>of fifteen months. ... I think "Wood
</p>
<p>should be imprisoned for ten months. . . .
</p>
<p>In regard to the respondent Geary, I
</p>
<p>agree with the finding of the court to the
</p>
<p>effect that the contempt alleged against
</p>
<p>him is not sufficiently established."

<p>THE END OF THE COl^SPIRACY
</p>
<p>Judge Morrow concurs in the findings
</p>
<p>contained in the opinion of Judge Gilbert,
</p>
<p>and adds : " In my judgment the evidence
</p>
<p>establishes the fact that there was a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy between the respondent ^Noyes,
</p>
<p>McKenzie, and others to secure posses-
</p>
<p>sion of certain valuable mining claims at
</p>
<p>Nome, Alaska, under proceedings involv-
</p>
<p>ing the appointment of a receiver, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of working the properties and
</p>
<p>obtaining the gold deposited in the claims.
</p>
<p>To carry these proceedings to a supposed
</p>
<p>successful conclusion, Noyes, McKenzie,
</p>
<p>and others found it a necessary part of
</p>
<p>the scheme to resist the process of this
</p>
<p>court. In pursuance of this conspiracy,
</p>
<p>the contempt charged against ^NToyes was
</p>
<p>committed; but I agree with Judge Gil-

<p>judicial position, I concur in his judgment

<p>that the respondent be required to pay a

</p>
<p>A giant conspiracy indeed, far-reaching
</p>
<p>in its ramifications, which received its
</p>
<p>death-blow in the arrest and sentence of
</p>
<p>Alexander McKenzie, and which may be
</p>
<p>said to have had its proper interment in
</p>
<p>the recent adjudication of the Circuit
</p>
<p>Court of Appeals. It only remains for
</p>
<p>the President to remove from office the
</p>
<p>judge who has so flagrantly disgraced the

<p>federal bench, and to appoint a successor

<p>under whose administration of justice a

<p>marvelous mineral region will develop

<p>with rapidity and confidence.*

<p>*As this book is going through the press, the an-
</p>
<p>nouncement is made from Washington, February 23,
</p>
<p>that, upon the recommendation of the Attorney-Gen-

<p>and McCumber of ]S"orth Dakota, to " vin-

<p>dicate " McKenzie and IS'oyes. The pres-

<p>sist mainly in attacking the intelligence

<p>and integrity of the three eminent jurists

<p>who constitute the United States Circuit

</p>
<p>The credit for relieving northwestern

<p>longs to three equally essential factors:

<p>first, Charles D. Lane, president of the

<p>age to fight the " ring " to a finish without
