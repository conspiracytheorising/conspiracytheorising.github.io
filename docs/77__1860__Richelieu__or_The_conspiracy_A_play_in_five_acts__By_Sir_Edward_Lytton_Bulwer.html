<p>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>The administration of Cardinal Richelieu, whom (despite
</p>
<p>all his darker qualities,) Voltaire alnd History justly consider the true architect of the Frencl monarchy, and the
</p>
<p>great parent of French civilization; is characterized by features alike tragic and comic. A weak king-an ambitious
</p>
<p>favourite; a despicable conspiracy against the minister,
</p>
<p>nearly always associated with a dangerous treason against
</p>
<p>the State-these, with little variety of names and dates,
</p>
<p>constitute the eventful cycle through which, with a dazzling
</p>
<p>ease, and an arrogant confidence, the great luminary fulfilled
</p>
<p>its destinies. Blent together, in startling contrast,, we see
</p>
<p>the grandest achievements and the pettiest agents;-the
</p>
<p>spy-the mistress-the capuchin;-the destruction of feudalism; the humiliation of Austria;-the dismemberment
</p>
<p>of Spain.
</p>
<p>Richelieu himself is still what he was in his own day -a
</p>
<p>man of two characters. If, on the one hand, he is justly
</p>
<p>represented as inflexible and vindictive, crafty and unscrupulous; so, on the other, it cannot be denied that he was
</p>
<p>placed in times in which the long impunity of every license
</p>
<p>required stern examples-that he was beset by perils and intrigues, which gave a certain excuse to the subtlest inventions of self-defence-that his ambition was inseparably connected with a passionate love for the glory of his countryand that, if he was her dictator, he was not less her benefactor. It has been fairly remarked by the most impartial
</p>
<p>historians, that he. was no less generous to merit than severe
</p>
<p>to crime-that, in the various departments of the State, the
</p>
<p>Army, and the Church, he selected and distinguished the
</p>
<p>ablest aspirants-that the wars which he conducted were,
</p>
<p>for the most part, essential to the preservation of France,
</p>

</p>
<p>Public Domain / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd
</p>
<p>aznd Europe itself, from the formidable encroachments of the
</p>
<p>Austrian House-that, m spite of those wars, the people
</p>
<p>were not oppressed with exhorbitant imposts-and that ho
</p>
<p>left the kingdom he had governed in a more flourishing and
</p>
<p>vigorous state than at any former period of the French history, or at the decease of Louis XIV.
</p>
<p>The cabels formed against the great statesman were not
</p>
<p>carried on by the patriotism of public virtue, nor the emulation of equal talent; they were but court struggles, in
</p>
<p>which the most worthless agents had recourse to the most
</p>
<p>desperate means.-In each, as I have before observed, we
</p>
<p>see combined the twofold attempt to murder the minister,
</p>
<p>and to betray the country. Such, then, are the agents, and
</p>
<p>such the designs, with which truth, in the Drama, as in History, requires us to'contrast the celebrated Cardinal; not
</p>
<p>disguising his foibles or his vices, but not unjust to the
</p>
<p>grander qualities (especially the love of country,) by which
</p>
<p>they were often dignified, and, at times, redeemed.
</p>
<p>The historical drama is the concentration of historical
</p>
<p>events. In the attempt to place upon the stage the picture
</p>
<p>of an era, that license with dates and details, which Poetry
</p>
<p>permits, and which the highest authorities in the Drama of
</p>
<p>France herself, have sanctioned, has been, though not unsparingly, indulged. The conspiracy of the Due de Bouillon
</p>
<p>is, for instance, amalgamated with the denouncement of the
</p>
<p>Day of Dupes; and circumstances connected with the treason of Cinq-Mars (whose brilliant youth and gloomy catastrophe tend to subvert poetic and historic justice, by seducing us to forget his base ingratitude and his perfidious apostacy,) are identified with the fate of the earlier favourite
</p>
<p>Baradas, whose sudden rise and as sudden fall passed into a
</p>
<p>proverb. I ought to add, that the noble romance of CinqMars suggested one of the scenes in the fifth act; and that
</p>
<p>for the conception of some portion of the intrigue connected
</p>
<p>with De Mauprat and Julie, I am with great alterations of
</p>
<p>incident, and considerable if not entire reconstruction of
</p>
<p>character, indebted to an early and admirable novel by the
</p>
<p>author of Picciola.

</p>
<p>EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>The play of RICHEILIEU is far the most elaborate of Mr.
</p>
<p>Bulwer's dramatic productions. It was originally per,
</p>
<p>formed, March 7th, 1839,at the Covent Garden Theatre,
</p>
<p>to an overflowing house-Macready appearing as the Cardinal and Miss Helen Fancit as Julie. It was put on the
</p>
<p>stage with every possible advantage of scenery and costume,
</p>
<p>and efficiently sustained throughout, in all its characters, by
</p>
<p>an excellent company. Its success was remarkably brilliant;
</p>
<p>and, for a series of nights, it drew crouded and delighted
</p>
<p>audiences.
</p>
<p>The author seems to have been partially indebtet for his
</p>
<p>materials, to the historical novels of Alfred de Yigny, from
</p>
<p>whose admirable picture of the character of Richelieu, in
</p>
<p>"Cinq-Mars," he has borrowed some leading traits. He
</p>
<p>acknowledges his obligations to these and other sources in
</p>
<p>his preface. The original merits of the play, however, are
</p>
<p>obvious and great; and it may be regarded as one of the
</p>
<p>most unexceptionable modern contributions to the English
</p>
<p>Standard Drama. It abounds in passages of great beauty,
</p>
<p>and of a high order of poetry.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously with its appearance in England, the play
</p>
<p>was received in this country by Mr. Forrest, to whom it
</p>
<p>nad been consigned by Mr. Bulwer, to be introduced upon
</p>
<p>the American Stage. It is unnecessary for us to say, with
</p>
<p>what ability the task was performed by our great tragedian.
</p>
<p>His personation of the old, high-spirited Cardinal, is alone
</p>
<p>sufficient to vindicate his claims to a lasting histrionic reputation.. It has never been surpassed-and to our mind,

<p>our Council on the punishment to be awarded to Messire

<p>De Ber Chevalier,

<p>Your cook's a miracle,-what my Host gone?

<p>Faith, Count, my office is a post of danger;

</p>
<p>Bar. You
</p>
<p>Will be released ere long The king resolves
</p>
<p>To call the bride to court this day.
</p>
<p>De Ber. Poor Mauprat!
</p>
<p>Yet, since yoru love the lady, why so careless
</p>
<p>Of the King's suit
</p>
<p>Bar. Because the lady's virtuous,
</p>
<p>And the king timid. Ere he win the suit
</p>
<p>He'll lose the crown,-the bride will be a widowAnd I the Richelieu of the Regent Orleans.
</p>
<p>De Ber. Is Louis still so chafed against the Fox,
</p>
<p>From snatching yon fair dainty from the Lion I
</p>
<p>Bar. So chafed that Richelieu totters. Yes, the King,
</p>
<p>Is half conspiring against the Cardinal.
</p>
<p>Enough of this. I've found the man we wanted,The man to head the hands that murder'd Richelieu,The man, whose name the synoneme for daring.
</p>
<p>De Be,. lie must mean me! No' Count, I am, I own,
</p>

</p>
<p>But LMaupret? Mark, to-night we meet at Marion's,

<p>I'inere shall we sign: thence send this scroll (showing it)

<p>to Bouillon.
</p>
<p>You're in that secret (affectionately) one of our new Council.
</p>
<p>De Ber. But to admit the Spaniard-France's foe.
</p>
<p>Into the heart of France,-dethrone the King!
</p>
<p>It looks like treason, and I smell the headsman.

<p>And warn their sons against the glorious theft,
</p>
<p>Forgetful of the darkness which it broke,
</p>
<p>I have shed blood-but I have had no foes
</p>
<p>Save those the State had (2)-if my wrath was deadly.'Tis that I felt my country in my veins,
</p>
<p>And smote her sons as Brutus smote his own. (3)
</p>
<p>And yet I am not happy-blanch'd and sear'd
</p>
<p>Before my time-breathing an air of hate,
</p>
<p>And seeing daggers in the eyes of men,
</p>
<p>And wasting powers that shake the thrones of earth
</p>
<p>In contest with the insects-bearding kings
</p>
<p>And braved by lackies (4)-murder at my bed;
</p>
<p>And lone amidst the multitudinous web,

<p>With the dread Three-that are the fates who hold

</p>
<p>And this is Power! Alas! I am not happy. (After a pause.)

<p>And yet the Nile is fretted by the weeds

<p>Am I so ruthless then that I do hate
</p>
<p>Them who hate me? Tush, tush I I do not hate;
</p>
<p>Nay, I forgive. The Statesman writes the doom,

<p>But the Priest sends the blessing. I forgive them,

<p>But I destroy; forgiveness is mine own.

<p>Destruction is the State's! For private life

<p>Would Fortune serve me if the Heoven were worth?

<p>For chance makes half my greatness. I was born

<p>Beneath the aspect of a briglht-eyed star,

<p>Is but the fix'd persuasion of success.

<p>Orleans. How does my brother bear the Cardinals
</p>
<p>death?
</p>
<p>Bar. With grief when thinking of the toils of State;
</p>
<p>With joy, when thinking on the eyes of Julie:At times he sighs, " Who now shall govern France?"
</p>
<p>Anon exclaimsl" Who now shall baffle Louis?"
</p>
<p>Enter Louis and other Courtiers. They uncover.
</p>
<p>Orleans. Now, my liege, now, I can embrace a brother.
</p>
<p>Louis. Dear Gaston, yes. I do believe you lore me;Richelieu denied it-sever'd us too long.
</p>
<p>A great man, Gaston! Who shall govern France?
</p>
<p>Bar. Yourself, my liege. That swart and potent star
</p>
<p>Eclipsed your royal orb. He served the country.
</p>
<p>But did he serve, or seek to sway the King?
</p>
<p>Louis. You're right-he was an able politician l(1)

</p>
<p>Am I not to be pitied?-what a day
</p>
<p>ForBar-. Sorrow? No, sire!
</p>
<p>Louis. Bah I for Ahuting, man,
</p>
<p>And Richelieu's dead;'twould be an indecorum
</p>
<p>Till he is buried-(yawns)-life is very tedious.
</p>
<p>I made a madrigal on life last week;
</p>
<p>You do not sing, (3) Count? Pity; you should learn.
</p>
<p>Poor Richelieu had no ear-yet a great man.
</p>
<p>Ah! what a weary weight devolves upon me!
</p>
<p>These endless wars-these thankless ParliamentsThe snares in which he tangled States and Kings,
</p>
<p>Like the old fisher of the fable, Proteus,
</p>
<p>Netting great Neptune's wariest tribes and changing
</p>
<p>Into all shapes when Craft pursued himself;
</p>
<p>Oh, a great man!
</p>
<p>Bar. Your royal mother said so,
</p>
<p>And died in exile.
</p>
<p>Louis, (sadly). True: I loved my mother 1 (4)
</p>
<p>Bar. The Cardinal dies. Yet day revives the earth
</p>
<p>The rivers run not back. In truth, my liege,
</p>
<p>Did your high orb on others shine as on him,
</p>
<p>Why, things as dull in their own selves as I am
</p>
<p>Would glow as brightly with the borrowed beam. (5)

</p>
<p>Louis. And, had he lived,
</p>
<p>I know another head, my Baradas,
</p>
<p>That would have propp'd the pile: I've seen him eye- these
</p>
<p>With a most hungry fancy.
</p>
<p>Bagr. (anxiously). Sire, I knew
</p>
<p>You would protect me.
</p>
<p>Loutis. Did you so? of course!
</p>
<p>And yet he had a way with him-a something
</p>
<p>But no matter, he is dead.

<p>NOTES TO RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>NOTES TO ACT I.
</p>
<p>(1) Olivares, Minister of Spain.
</p>
<p>(2) There are many anecdotes of the irony, often so terrible, in which
</p>
<p>Richelieu indulged. But he had a love for humour in its more hearty and
</p>
<p>genial shape. He would send for Boisrobert "to make him laugh, and
</p>
<p>grave ministers and magnates waited in the ante-room, while the great
</p>
<p>Cardinal listened and responded to the sallies of the lively wit.
</p>
<p>(3) The Abbe Arnaud tells us that the queen was a little avenged on the
</p>
<p>Cardinal by the ill-success of the tragic comedy of Mirame-more than
</p>
<p>suspected to be his own-though presented- to the world under the foster
</p>
<p>name of Desmarets. Its representation (says Pelisson) cost him 300,000
</p>
<p>crowns. He was so transported out of himself by the performance, that at
</p>
<p>one time, he thrust his person -alf out of his box to show himself to the
</p>
<p>assembly; at another time he imposed silence on the audience that they
</p>
<p>might not lose " des enidroits encore plus beauex." He said afterwards to
</p>
<p>Desmarets "Eh'bien, les Francais n'auront done jamais de gout. Ils
</p>
<p>n'ont pas et6 charmes de Mirame!" Arnand says pithily, " On ne pouvoit
</p>
<p>Alors avoir d'autre satisfaction des offenses d'un nomme qui 6toit maitre de
</p>
<p>tout, et redoutable a tout le monde. " Nevertheless his style in prose,
</p>
<p>though not devoid of the pedantic affectations of the time, often rises into
</p>
<p>very noble eloquence.
</p>

</p>
<p>and influence with Richelieu, grossly exaggerated in his own day, are now
</p>
<p>rightfully estimated.

<p>(1) Richelieu not only employed the lowest, but would often consult men
</p>
<p>commonly esteemed the dullest. " 11 disoit que dans des choses de tres

<p>(2) Brth Ric.: elium nd Joseph were originally inte and for the profos.
</p>
<p>sion of alrns. Josepl: ha l served before he obeyed I he spiritual inspiration to beco:ne a Capaclhip.'The dea.th of his brother opened to Richeliau
</p>
<p>the Bislhopric of Lucon; but his military propensities were as strong a.
</p>
<p>tls priestly ambition. I need scarcely add that the Cardinal, during his
</p>
<p>brilliant campaign in Italy, marched at the head of his troops in complete
</p>
<p>arlour. It was under his adiniistration that occurs the last example of proclaiming war by the chivahiic defiance of lherald and cartel. Richelieu
</p>
<p>valued himself much on hIis personal activity. for his vanity was as universal a isi amllbition. A noblema.n at the house of Grammont one day
</p>
<p>found him mployiedl in ju.mvrni, and, with all the sav:-:ii vivre of a Frenchman a.d a courtier, offered to junmp against him. lie suffered the Cardinal
</p>
<p>to jump higher, and soon ai'te found himself rewarded by an appointment. Yet, strangely enough, this vanity did not lead to a pIatronage injurious to the state; for never before in France was ability i ade so essential a requisite in promotion. He was lucky in finding the cleverest
</p>
<p>fellows among his adroitest flatterers.
</p>
<p>(3) Voltaire openly charges Richelieu with being the lover of Marion de
</p>
<p>Lorme, whom the great peet of France, Victor Hugo, has sacrificed History to adorn with qualities which were certainly not added to her personal
</p>
<p>charms.-She was not less perfidious than beanutiful.-Le Clerc, properly,
</p>
<p>refutos the accusation of Voltaire, against the discretion of Richelieu
</p>
<p>and says, very justly, that if the great minister had the frailties of human
</p>
<p>nature, he learnt how to veil theml, at least'when he obtained the scarlet.
</p>
<p>In earlier life he had been prone to gallantries which a little prepossessed
</p>
<p>the King (who was formal and decorous, and threw a singular coldness
</p>
<p>into the few attachments he permitted to himself) against the aspiring intriguer. But these gayer occupations died away in the engagement of
</p>
<p>higher pursuits or of darker passions.
</p>
<p>(4) Riclelieeu did in fact so thoroughly associate himself with the State,
</p>
<p>that, in cases where the extreme penalty of the law had been incurred, Le
</p>
<p>Clelr justly observes that he was more inexorable to those he had favoured
</p>
<p>-even to his own connections than to other and more indiffirent offenders. It must be remembered as some excuse for his unrelenting sternness,
</p>
<p>that, before his time, the great had been accustomed to commnit any disorder with impunity-even the crime of treason, " auparavant on ne faisoit poser lea armes aux rebelles qu'en lenr accordant quelque r6compense."
</p>
<p>On entering into the administration, he therefore laid it down as a maxim
</p>
<p>necessary to the existence of the State, that " no crime should he comnmitted with impunity." To carry out this maxim, the long estatblished license to crime made even justice seem cruel. But the victims mlst rcomnmiserated'from their birth or accomplishmelts, as Montmorenci, or Cinq
</p>
<p>Mars waere traitors in actual conspiracy against their country, anii would
</p>
<p>have forfeited life in any land where thle punishment of death existed,
</p>
<p>and the lawgiver was stron enough to vindicate the law. Richeltieu was
</p>
<p>in fact a patriot unsoftened by philantrophy. As in Venice (waere the
</p>
<p>favourite aphorismi was, Venice first, Christianity next,) so, with Richelieu
</p>
<p>the primary conideration was,' wvlat will be the best for the Colntry?"
</p>

<p>applied to the world that lay beyond the boundaries of France. Thus he,
</p>
<p>whose object waas to founid in Fra.nce a splendid and imperious desi.otismn
</p>
<p>assisted the Pariianmentary ptarty in Engtland, and signed a treaty of alliance and subsides with the Catalan rebels for the establishment of a
</p>
<p>Republic in Barcelona:-to convulse other Monarchies was to consolidate
</p>
<p>the glowing Monarchy of France. So he, who conpletely crushed the
</p>
<p>Protestant party at home. braved all the wrath of the Vaican. and even
</p>
<p>RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>theb resentment of the King, in giving the most essential aid to the Protestants abroad. There was, indeed, a largeness of view in his hostility
</p>
<p>to the French Huguenots, which must be carefully distinguished from the
</p>
<p>intolerance of the mere priest. He opposed them, not as a Catholic, but as
</p>
<p>a Statesman. The Huguenots were strong republicans, and had formed
</p>
<p>plans for dividing France into provincial commonwealths; and the existence of Rochelle was absolutely incompatible with the integrity of the
</p>
<p>French Monarchy. It was a second capital held by the Huguenots, claiming independent authority, and the right to treat with Foreign Powers.
</p>
<p>Richelieu's final conquest was markaed by a humanity, that had nothing of
</p>
<p>the bigot. The Huguenots obtained a complete amnesty, and'had only to
</p>
<p>regret the loss of privileges and fortitications which could not have existed
</p>
<p>with any security to the rest of France.
</p>
<p>(5) The guard attached to Richelieu's person was, in the first' instance,
</p>
<p>fifty arquebussiers, afterwards increased to two companies of cavalry and
</p>
<p>two hundred musqueteers. Huguet is, therefore, to be considered merely
</p>
<p>as the lieutenant of a small detachment of.this little army. In point ot
</p>
<p>fact the subdivisions of the guard took it in turns to serve.
</p>
<p>(6) This tract, on the " Unity of the Minister," contains all the doctrines, and many more to the same effect, referred to in the text, and had a
</p>
<p>prodigious influence on the conscience of the poor king. At the onset of
</p>
<p>lis career, Richelieu, as deputy of the clergy of Poitou, complained in his
</p>
<p>harangue to the king that ecclesiastics were too rarely summoned to the
</p>
<p>royal councils, and invoked the example of the Druids!
</p>
<p>(7) Joseph's ambition was not, however, so moderate; he refused a
</p>
<p>bishopric, and desired the Cardinal's Hat, for which favour Richelieu
</p>
<p>openly supplicated the Holy See, but contrived, somehow or other, never
</p>
<p>to effect it, although two ambassadors applied for it at Rome.
</p>
<p>(8) The peculiar religion of Pbre Joseph may be illustrated by the following anecdote:-An officer, whom lie had dismissed upon an expedition
</p>
<p>into Germany, moved by conscience at the orders he had received, returned
</p>
<p>for farther explanations, and found the Capuchin disqat sa mlsse. He approached and whispered "But, my -father, if these people defend themselves-'" " Kill all," (Qu'on tue tout,) answered the good father, continuing his devotion.

<p>which, in the text, mingle with Richelieu's better-founded arguments ii

<p>throughout the writings ascribed to him. The reader will observe that il

<p>94
</p>
<p>RICHELIEU,
</p>
<p>this self-confession lies the atent, poetical justice,-which separates',
</p>
<p>piness from success.
</p>
<p>[2] It is well known that when, on his death-bed, Richelieu was asked
</p>
<p>if he forgave his enemies, he replied, "I never had any, but those or the
</p>
<p>state." And this was true enough, for Richelieu al-d the state were
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>[3] Richelien's vindication of himself from cruelty will be foundin
</p>
<p>various parts of Petitot's Collection, vols. xxi. xxx.
</p>
<p>[4] Voltaire has a striking passage on the singular fate of Richelieu,
</p>
<p>recalled every hour from his gigantic schemes to frustrate some miserable
</p>
<p>cabal of the ante-room. Richelieu would often exclaim, that " Six pieds
</p>
<p>de terre [as he called the king's cabinet] lui donnaient plus de peine que
</p>
<p>tout le reste de l'Europe." The death of Wallenstein, sacrificed by the
</p>
<p>Emperor Ferdinand, produced a most lively impression upon Richelieu.
</p>
<p>He found many traits of comparison between Ferdinand and Louis-Wal,
</p>
<p>lenstein and himself. In the Memoirs-now regarded by the best authorities as written by his sanction, and in great part by himself-the great
</p>
<p>Frenchman bursts [when alluding to Wallenstein's murder I into a touching and pathetic anathema on the rmiserede cette vie of dependence on jealous and timid royalty, which he himself, while he wrote, sustained. It is
</p>
<p>worthy of remark, that it was precisely at the period of Wallenstein's
</p>
<p>death that Richelieu obtained from the king an augmentation of his
</p>
<p>guard.
</p>
<p>[51 Richelieu was commonly supposed, though I cannot say I find much
</p>
<p>evidence for it, to have been too presuming in an interview with Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria [the Queen,] and to have bitterly resented the contempt she expressed for him. The Duke of Buckingham's frantic and Quixotic passion
</p>
<p>tor the Queen is well known.
</p>
<p>[6] The fear and the hatred which Richelieu generally inspired were not
</p>
<p>shared by his dependants and those about his person, who are said " to
</p>
<p>have adored him."-Ses domestiques le regardaient comme le meilleur des
</p>
<p>maitres.-Le Clerc. In fact although il etoit orgueileux et colere,-he was
</p>
<p>en mneme temps, affable et plein de douceur dans l'abhod; and he was no less
</p>
<p>generous to those who served than severe to those who opposed him.
</p>
<p>[7] In common with his contemporaries, Richelieu was credulous in astrology's less lawful arts. Hle was too fortunate a man not to be superstitious.

<p>earlier youth to have exhibited the germs of. nobler qualities; but a
</p>
<p>blight seems to have passed over his maturer life. Personally brave,
</p>
<p>but morally timid,-always governed, whether by his mother or his minister, and always repining at the yoke. The only affection amounting to a
</p>
<p>passion that he betrayed was for the sports of the field; yet it was his
</p>
<p>craving weakless, and this throws a kind of false interest over his character, to wish to be loved. He himself loved no one. He suffered the only
</p>
<p>woman who seems to have been attached to him to wither in a convent 
</p>
<p>be gave lup favo-irite after favourite to exile or the block. When Richelieu
</p>
<p>died, he said, coldly, " Voila un grand pblitique moit!': acd whe th, ill

</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>fated but unprincipled Cinq Mars, whom he called le cher amni, was he
</p>
<p>headed, he drew out his watch at the fatal hour, and said with a smile, "
</p>
<p>think at this moment that le cher ami fait unevilaine mine.' Ncverthe
</p>
<p>less his conscience at times [for he was devout and superstitious] made
</p>
<p>him gentle; and his pride and his honour would often, when least expect.
</p>
<p>ed, rouse him into haughty but brief resistance to the despotism undel
</p>
<p>which he lived.
</p>
<p>[3] Louis had some musical taste and accomplishment, wherewith he
</p>
<p>often communicated to his favourites some of that wearisome ennui under
</p>
<p>Which he himself almost unceasingly languished.
</p>
<p>[4] One of Louis's most bitter complaints against Richelieu was the
</p>
<p>continued banishment of the Queen Mother. It is impossible, however, now
</p>
<p>to be convinced that the return of that worthless intriguante was wholly
</p>
<p>incompatible with the tranquility of the kingdom. Yet, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>the poverty and privation which she endured in exile are discreditable to
</p>
<p>the generosity and the gratitude of Richelie she was his first patron,
</p>
<p>though afterwards his most powerful persecutor.
</p>
<p>[5] In his Memoirs Richelieu gives an amusing account of theinsolence
</p>
<p>and arts of Baradas, and observes with indignant astonishment, that the
</p>
<p>favourite was never weary of repeating to the King that he [Baradas]
</p>
<p>would have made just as great a minister as Richelieu. It is on the attachment of Baradas to La Cressias, a maid of honour to the Queen Mother
</p>
<p>of whom, according to Baradas, the King was enamoured also, that his
</p>
<p>love for the Julie de Mortemar of the play has been founded. The secret of
</p>
<p>Baradas's sudden and extraordinary influence with the King seems to rest
</p>
<p>in the personal adoration which he professed for Louis, with whom he
</p>
<p>affected all the jealousy of a lover, but whom he flattered with the ardent
</p>
<p>chivalry of a knight. Even after his disgrace he placed upon his banner,
</p>
<p>" Fiat voluntas tua."
</p>
<p>[6] Louis was called The Just, but for no other reason than that he was
</p>
<p>born under the Libra.
</p>
<p>[7] Louis XIII, did not resemble either his father or his son in the ardour of his attachments; if not wholly platonic, they were wholly unim.
</p>
<p>passioned; yet no man was more jealous, or more unscrupulously tyrannical when the jealousy was aroused.
</p>
<p>[8] One of Richelieu's severest and least politic laws was that which
</p>
<p>made duelling a capital crime. Never was the punishment against the
</p>

</p>
<p>offence more relentlessly enforced; and never were duels so desperate and
</p>
<p>so numerous. The punishment of death must be evidently ineffectual so
</p>
<p>long as to refuse a duel is to be dishonoured, and so long as men hold the
</p>
<p>doctrine, however wrong, that it is better to part with the life that Heaven
</p>
<p>gave than the honour man makes. In fact, the greater the danger lie incurred, the greater was the punctilio of the cavalier of the time in braving it.
</p>
<p>[9] For the haughty and rebuking tone which Richelieu assumed in his
</p>
<p>postulations with the King, see his Memoirs [passim] in [Petitot's collection, vols. 22-30 Ibis.] Montesquieu, in one of his brilliant antitheses says
</p>
<p>well of Richelieu, II avila le roi, mais il illustrata le regne.":
</p>
<p>[10] However " orgueilleu. and colere" in his disputes with Louis, the
</p>
<p>Cardinal did not always disdain recourse to the arts of the courtier;-once
</p>
<p>after an angry discussion with the king, in which, as usual, Richelieu got
</p>
<p>the better, Louis, as they quitted the palace together, said rudely, " Sortez!e premier; vous etes bien le roi de France,' " Sije passe le premier,"
</p>
<p>replied the minister, after a moment's hesitation, and with great adroitness
</p>
<p>" ce ne pent etre que comme le plus humble de vos serviteurs;" and he
</p>
<p>took a flambeau from one of the pages, to light the king as he walked before him-" en reculant et sans tournes le dos."

</p>
<p>[12] Like Cromwell and Rienzi, Richelieu appears to have been easily
</p>
<p>moved to tears. The Queen Mother, who put the hardest interpretation on
</p>
<p>that humane weakness, which is natural with very excitable temperaments
</p>
<p>said that " I1 pleurait quand il voulait.'" I may add to those who may be
</p>
<p>inclined to imagine that Richelieu appears in parts of this scene too deected for consistency wi h so imperious a character, that it is recorded of
</p>
<p>him that ( quand ses affaires ne eruississoient pas, ii se trouvoit abattu et
</p>
<p>eponvante, et quand il obtenoit ce u'il souhaitoit, il etoit tier et insultant.'
</p>
<p>NOTES TO ACT Y.
</p>
<p>[1] See in " Cinq Mars," vol. v. the striking and brilliant chapter from
</p>
<p>which the interlude of the Secretaries is borrowed.
</p>
<p>[2] The passion of the drama requires this catastrophe for Baradas. He
</p>
<p>however, survived his disgrace, though stripped of all his rapidly-acquired
</p>
<p>fortunes-and the daring that belonged to his character won him distinction in foreign service. He returned to France after I'ichelieu's death, but
</p>
<p>never rgrained the same court influence. He had taken the vows of a
</p>
<p>knight of Malta, and Louis made him a Prior.
</p>
<p>[3] The sudden resuscitatin of Richelieu [not to strain too much on the
</p>
<p>real passion which supports him in this scene] is in conformance with the
</p>
<p>more dissimulating part of his character. The extraordinary mobility of
</p>
<p>his countenance [latterly so deathlike, save when the mind spoke in the
</p>
<p>features] always lent itself to -stage effect of this nature. The queen
</p>
<p>mother said of him, that she had seen him one moment so feeble, cast
</p>
<p>down, and " semi-mort," that lie seemed on the point of giving up the
</p>
<p>ghost-and the next moment he would start up full of animation, energy
</p>
<p>t.nd life.
