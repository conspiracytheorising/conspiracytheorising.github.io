<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>France was almost destroyed during the last five years,
</p>
<p>not by German guns, but by a moral plague. Far beyond
</p>
<p>the black pall of the enemy's barrage, far, far beyond the
</p>
<p>range of the most powerful Krupp cannon, there were other,
</p>
<p>invisible foes spreading contagion everywhere among the
</p>
<p>French people. It was a pestilence of falsehood, of hatred,
</p>
<p>of treason.
</p>
<p>Its manifestations were many and most mysterious. It
</p>
<p>appeared in munition strikes, army mutinies, the amazing
</p>
<p>boldness and apparently unrestricted activity of German
</p>
<p>spies; in pamphlets and newspaper editorials constantly
</p>
<p>emphasizing the "selfishness" of England, the "money mak-
</p>
<p>ing idealism" of the United States, the "impregnability" of
</p>
<p>Germany, the need of a "reapproachment with Teuton
</p>
<p>democracy," and most of all the "blessings of an immediate
</p>
<p>peace."
</p>
<p>Some of the men who plotted these crimes were not caught
</p>
<p>until France was on the brink of ruin. Others, of high sta-
</p>
<p>tion and mysteriously potent political power, almost escaped
</p>
<p>under a counterfire of recrimination against those who ex-
</p>
<p>posed them. For example, the offices of one editor who had
</p>
<p>accused the head of the police of being a traitor were raided.
</p>
<p>Guns were found, which, the police said, indicated a royalist
</p>
<p>plot. Later investigation showed that these arms were heir-
</p>
<p>looms, used for decorative purposes.
</p>
<p>Some of the plotters have been shot as traitors. A few
</p>
<p>were caught, as it were, with German gold still sticking to
</p>
<p>their fingers. But the whole story of this great conspiracy,
</p>
<p>a story which involves not only French police, but a high

<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>Cabinet officer, and even a former Premier of France, a story
</p>
<p>that should also be an omen and a warning to every American
</p>
<p>citizen, has never yet been told.
</p>
<p>The reader may ask:
</p>
<p>"How can this be an omen and a warning to the United
</p>
<p>States?"
</p>
<p>Because France and the United States have been built
</p>
<p>upon the same civic foundations.
</p>
<p>Because in their democratic form of government individual
</p>
<p>liberty may be easily abused by the political charlatan, the
</p>
<p>ignorant social agitator, or the paid agent of a foreign foe.
</p>
<p>Too often, as we Americans well know, has freedom of speech
</p>
<p>been made the mouthpiece of demagogism and the mask of
</p>
<p>treason.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ultimate triumph of France over her
</p>
<p>enemies both within and without should cheer and hearten
</p>
<p>every American who has faith in democratic institutions.
</p>
<p>In this story the reader will see how one leader after another
</p>
<p>rose among the French to free them from the traitors in
</p>
<p>their midst; and each failed until the strongest man of all
</p>
<p>emerged in the person of Georges Clemenceau, the last War
</p>
<p>Premier of France.
</p>
<p>The forces of social disruption in France were the same
</p>
<p>which wrecked Russia, the same which even now are at work
</p>
<p>in this country, fomenting class hatred, plotting bomb outr
</p>
<p>rages, seeking in every insidious and devious way to tear
</p>
<p>down the social structure to wb;eh they contributed nothing,
</p>
<p>but out of the destruction of which they hope to gain all.
</p>
<p>Even before the war Germany fostered in France the kind
</p>
<p>of socialism which became Bolshevism in Russia. The
</p>
<p>Berlin foreign office had thus planned to weaken the French
</p>
<p>morale to such a degree that the German armies on breaking
</p>
<p>through Belgium would find a foe divided against itself. Tn
</p>
<p>such an analysis of the French character, German psychology

</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>showed itself as obtuse as in trying to terrify England with
</p>
<p>Zeppelin raids.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Germany laid her plans with thorough Ger-
</p>
<p>man thoroughness. She sought to dominate the French
</p>
<p>bureaucracy by building up a political machine which would
</p>
<p>work for the abandonment of the Triple Entente, the isola-
</p>
<p>tion of England and a new alliance with Germany. At the
</p>
<p>head of this party Joseph Caillaux rose to great power ; and
</p>
<p>beside him, always obedient to his master's wishes, was Louis
</p>
<p>Malvy.
</p>
<p>Caillaux, the arch German conspirator, might have been
</p>
<p>master of France when the war broke and the Huns began
</p>
<p>marching on Paris had it not been for the fear and hate of
</p>
<p>a woman. Gaston Calmette, editor of the Figaro, was seek-
</p>
<p>ing to expose Caillaux, his German plots and counterplots,
</p>
<p>but before he could drive home the final blow the wife of
</p>
<p>Caillaux lay in wait for the editor in his office and shot him
</p>
<p>dead.
</p>
<p>Caillaux was forced to quit political office. Malvy re-
</p>
<p>mained. Both continued to work together and their power
</p>
<p>seemed very little shaken. Malvy, as Minister of the Inte-
</p>
<p>rior and head of the police and secret service, continued on
</p>
<p>in the war cabinet of Viviani, the coalition cabinet of Briand,
</p>
<p>the centralized cabinet of Ribot. Meanwhile the pestilence
</p>
<p>grew. The police seemed blind. Spies and enemies went and
</p>
<p>came without molestation. Circulars were distributed among
</p>
<p>the soldiers urging them to quit fighting and insist on an
</p>
<p>immediate peace. Complaints were made to Malvy, and the
</p>
<p>complaints were pigeonholed.
</p>
<p>Leon Daudet, editor of L y Action Franfaise, openly
</p>
<p>accused Malvy of being a traitor. Other journalists and
</p>
<p>political leaders attacked Malvy for permitting the most
</p>
<p>/awless elements of society to spread contagion throughout
</p>

<p>heed. Even when it was known that Malvy's own private
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>office was the rendezvous of Almeyreda, editor of the pacifist
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge, an ex-convict, leader of a band of apaches
</p>
<p>hired by Caillaux during the trial of his wife ; yes, even when
</p>
<p>it was proved that this desperado was preventing the arrest
</p>
<p>of enemy aliens and getting them out of concentration camps,
</p>
<p>Malvy still possessed enough influence to persuade Premier
</p>
<p>Painleve to drop further investigation.
</p>
<p>Then the storm broke.
</p>
<p>Painleve was forced out.
</p>
<p>Clemenceau, who had attacked Malvy in a memorable
</p>
<p>speech before the Senate on July 22, 1917, assumed the reins
</p>
<p>of government. Caillaux was arrested and sent to join his
</p>
<p>fellow conspirators in the prison of Sante. Spies and
</p>
<p>agitators were rounded up throughout France, and a broad
</p>
<p>trail of German intrigue and corruption was uncovered,
</p>
<p>which led from Paris to Berlin by way of Switzerland and
</p>
<p>New York.
</p>
<p>Then, and not till then, did the ravages of the pestilence
</p>
<p>begin to abate. They have not ceased. The seeds were sown
</p>
<p>too deep. The roots are still alive. Malvy was condemned,
</p>
<p>but his punishment was almost an apology. He was per-
</p>
<p>mitted to retain his citizenship. He was only exiled for
</p>
<p>five years. When he left Paris for San Sebastian, Spain,
</p>
<p>on August 12, 1918, a deputation from the General Labor
</p>
<p>Federation and Radical Socialist party raised the cry:
</p>
<p>"Vive Malvy!"
</p>
<p>When I was in Paris, as investigator and correspondent,
</p>
<p>both before and during the Peace Conference, I learned from
</p>
<p>various officials how France had fought an enemy within as
</p>
<p>well as without. It was a story which filled me with a new
</p>
<p>admiration for the French. It proved that the French, as
</p>
<p>a people, possess the same heroism as their soldiers, and can
</p>
<p>keep on fighting despite their wounds.
</p>
<p>The trials of the chief traitors particularly impressed me.

</p>
<p>They seemed object lessons, which all, who live in republics,
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>should know and understand. They taught a moral, which I
</p>
<p>felt it my duty to bring back to the United States. They
</p>
<p>revealed how corrupt politicians and demogogue editors can
</p>
<p>work unspeakable evil, if they are able to use class hatred
</p>
<p>as a 'shield as well as a sword.
</p>
<p>Take the Malvy case, for example. At first it appeared
</p>
<p>to me amazing that Malvy, who was finally exposed as one
</p>
<p>of the worst foes of France, could remain in the war cabinets
</p>
<p>of three successive Premiers. On inquiry I learned that Malvy
</p>
<p>stayed in power, because of the blind support of the Radical
</p>
<p>Socialists and the politicial patronage of Caillaux. Each
</p>
<p>Premier, until Clemenceau assumed control, believed he had
</p>
<p>to keep Malvy to pacify the socialists, who met all criticism
</p>
<p>of their Minister of the Interior with the reply :
</p>
<p>"The capitalists want to throw him out to seize everything
</p>
<p>for themselves. They cannot fool us with their lies. Malvy
</p>
<p>must stay, because he represents the proletariat."
</p>
<p>Many a politician and many an editor has attained great
</p>
<p>power in the United States by exploiting class hatred. And
</p>
<p>even in these perilous times, although they are laying the
</p>
<p>match of Bolshevism and revolution at the very door of our
</p>
<p>American institutions, the same politicians and editors are
</p>
<p>still raising the same cry. Not a few are preaching the pro-
</p>
<p>paganda of Germany's own agents in France, England and
</p>
<p>the other Allied countries of the Old World. They are
</p>
<p>cursing the Peace Conference, excoriating President Wilson,
</p>
<p>tearing the peace treaty to bits, condemning the League of
</p>
<p>Nations, as a delusion and a snare, spreading racial hatreds
</p>
<p>among the Irish, the Egyptians, the Hindus and the Moors.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Germany's industrial and commercial
</p>
<p>machinery, uninjured by the war, is preparing to reconquer
</p>
<p>the markets of the world.
</p>
<p>Let us search for the enemy within our own gates. Let
</p>
<p>us not wait too long, as France almost did.

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>The brotherhood of America and
</p>
<p>France was born in the War of In-
</p>
<p>dependence. It has never been ob-
</p>
<p>scured since. It has found its final
</p>
<p>consecration in the great fight we
</p>
<p>have just fought shoulder to shoulder
</p>
<p>for the liberty of the world. It will
</p>
<p>keep all its strength in the future and

<p>contribute to consolidate, in the in-
</p>
<p>terest of humanity, the peace which

<p>has been established, at the cost of
</p>
<p>so many sacrifices, by the defenders
</p>
<p>of right.

</p>
<p>The clocks of Paris were striking the noon hour.
</p>
<p>It was March 16, 1914, a little more than four months
</p>
<p>before the world war. The city lay peacefully beneath the
</p>
<p>warm spring sunshine, through which a few stray clouds
</p>
<p>drifted lazily.
</p>
<p>Crowds overflowed the sidewalks of the narrow side-streets
</p>
<p>and poured into the boulevards in ever broadening streams.
</p>
<p>Shops and offices were deserted, for all Paris goes to dejeu-
</p>
<p>ner at twelve and does not return to work until two. The
</p>
<p>richer storekeeper seeks a chair on the sidewalk in front of
</p>
<p>his favorite cafe. The more thrifty clerk jumps a motor bus
</p>
<p>or a subway train and travels all the way home to dine with
</p>
<p>wife and family. The laborer seats himself in a public
</p>
<p>square, and over his dinner pail and a bottle of red wine
</p>
<p>discusses socialism.
</p>
<p>Peaceful though Paris seemed, nevertheless she was already
</p>
<p>undermined by the enemy. Foes within and without had
</p>
<p>planned her doom. The spirit of murder, of force, of abso-
</p>
<p>lutism was already abroad in France; and the first tragedy
</p>
<p>of the millions of tragedies of the war was about to be en-

</p>
<p>acted that very day and hour.
</p>
<p>2 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>Through the noonday crowds a great, black limousine
</p>
<p>pushed its way impatiently. Tasselled curtains of delicate
</p>
<p>pink almost hid the man and woman within. The two were
</p>
<p>talking excitedly. Their faces reflected the same deathlike
</p>
<p>pallor. They were no other than Joseph Caillaux, Minister
</p>
<p>of Finance, the most powerful political leader in France,
</p>
<p>and his wife.
</p>
<p>The car was now crossing the Seine by the Pont de la
</p>
<p>Concorde. Ahead arose the obelisk in the Place de la
</p>
<p>Concorde, where the public guillotine once stood, where ret-
</p>
<p>ribution and death were meted out for those who in the past
</p>
<p>had plotted against France. Past the gaunt pillar, and on
</p>
<p>through the Rue Royale, where the victims of the Revolution
</p>
<p>were carried in tumbrels to the place of execution, the auto-
</p>
<p>mobile hurried still faster. Caillaux continued talking with
</p>
<p>even more frenzied gestures.
</p>
<p>"Then you were unable to find anyone who could stop
</p>
<p>Calmette?" he cried, taking his wife's hands, which she had
</p>
<p>dropped helplessly in his, and pressing them to his face.
</p>
<p>"No one, no one," she answered in hardly more than a
</p>
<p>moan. "All say the same thing. Calmette will not stop. The
</p>
<p>Figaro tomorrow, they say, will publish private papers,
</p>
<p>taken from your desk, which will drive you out of France."
</p>
<p>"They are our love letters oh, God, they are our love
</p>
<p>letters. He is seeking your ruin as well as mine."
</p>
<p>"Then what are you going to do?"
</p>
<p>"I will kill him!" exclaimed Caillaux, clasping her hands
</p>
<p>still tighter.
</p>
<p>"When, when?" she asked convulsively.
</p>
<p>"In my own time," he replied.
</p>
<p>They reached home and sat down to their dejewner.
</p>
<p>They were alone in the great dining room. They kept
</p>
<p>talking always of the same thing. From fa.cts since ob-
</p>
<p>tained by various governmental investigations, it is now

</p>
<p>possible to picture this fateful scene.
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>Caillaux at that very hour was planning to become the
</p>
<p>Lenine of France. He had been in league with Germany for
</p>
<p>years, working always in the interest of the Kaiser and in
</p>
<p>co-operation with the Kaiser's agents. He had been building
</p>
<p>up a socialist party in France, which practically controlled
</p>
<p>the Chamber of Deputies, and which contained leaders ready
</p>
<p>to set France aflame with a Bolshevist revolution as soon as
</p>
<p>Berlin gave the command.
</p>
<p>For two months Gaston Calmette had been attacking
</p>
<p>Caillaux in the columns of the Figaro. The assaults were
</p>
<p>becoming fiercer and fiercer each day. Up to that time the
</p>
<p>private, the domestic life of Caillaux had been allowed to
</p>
<p>remain in the background of the fight. Only the machina-
</p>
<p>tions of Caillaux in high finance and in politics were being
</p>
<p>laid bare to public view, and with only the avowed purpose
</p>
<p>of proving to the French people that Caillaux was a wolf in
</p>
<p>sheep's clothing, and that underneath all he was the worst
</p>
<p>foe of France. Calmette pictured Caillaux as a liar, grafter,
</p>
<p>blackmailer, thief ; and produced a mass of evidence to prove
</p>
<p>his charges.
</p>
<p>Again and again the editor of the Figaro also pointed to
</p>
<p>Caillaux as the secret ally of Germany. He repeated the
</p>
<p>accusation that Caillaux, when Prime Minister in 1911 dur-
</p>
<p>ing the Agadir embroglio, clandestinely negociated a treaty
</p>
<p>with Germany, by which she lost to Germany a vast tract in
</p>
<p>the French Congo and other vital interests.
</p>
<p>Caillaux had heard this very day that Calmette had ob-
</p>
<p>tained possession of two other documents, which proved still
</p>
<p>more conclusively his alliance with Germany. It was the
</p>
<p>publication of these papers, which he dreaded most.
</p>
<p>At the luncheon table, however, he talked about love
</p>
<p>letters. Three days before, on March 13, Calmette printed
</p>
<p>a letter, which Caillaux had written his second wife before
</p>
<p>their marriage, signed "Thy Jo." The editor explained that
</p>

</p>
<p>he did not intend to begin the exposure of Caillaux's home
</p>
<p>4 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>life, and only used the letter to illustrate the hypocrisy of
</p>
<p>Caillaux's statesmanship. In this letter Caillaux wrote:
</p>
<p>"I was compelled to endure two trying sittings of the
</p>
<p>Chamber. However, I scored the finest success, and demol-
</p>
<p>ished the income tax, while apparently defending it. I
</p>
<p>earned applause from the Centre and Right, and yet did
</p>
<p>not displease the Left too greatly. I succeeded in giving a
</p>
<p>turn of the helm to the Right, which was indispensable."
</p>
<p>Of letters Caillaux kept talking, of other letters which
</p>
<p>would disclose the scandal in his own household, of the
</p>
<p>skeletons in his own closets, which he said the Figaro would
</p>
<p>soon drag out and parade for public view. It was a sub-
</p>
<p>ject well adapted to arouse the hate and fury of a woman.
</p>
<p>Of his first wife he spoke, of Mine. Gueydan, whom he had
</p>
<p>divorced for the woman opposite him. Always referring to
</p>
<p>the earlier Mme. Caillaux, as "she," he continued:
</p>
<p>''She has given Calmette the photographs of our love let-
</p>
<p>ters. As I have told you, she burned the originals. When
</p>
<p>I found she had discovered them in my desk, I promised I
</p>
<p>would give you up, if she would destroy them."
</p>
<p>There was only a moan in reply, and Caillaux continued :
</p>
<p>"She did not believe me. She made photographic copies.
</p>
<p>Calmette has them. He intends to ruin you as well as me."
</p>
<p>What the wife said is not known. After her husband left
</p>
<p>home with the remark that there was a most important
</p>
<p>meeting of the Finance Committee of the Senate, which he
</p>
<p>did not feel like attending, and that he must find a deputy
</p>
<p>to take his place, Mme. Caillaux went to her boudoir and
</p>
<p>donned the simplest kind of street dress. A moment later
</p>
<p>she was in her automobile.
</p>
<p>That evening the Italian Ambassador was to be the host
</p>
<p>of a state dinner at the Italian Embassy. The following
</p>
<p>Monday night, Mme. Caillaux had planned a banquet to

</p>
<p>which many of the same guests had been invited. Despite
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 5
</p>
<p>the tragic thoughts with which her mind was racked, she
</p>
<p>did not forget the preparations for this banquet. Her first
</p>
<p>stop was at an employment agency, where she hired a
</p>
<p>cook. From there she went to a gun store. The first re-
</p>
<p>volver she lifted was too heavy. With a lighter one she
</p>
<p>fired several shots at a target.
</p>
<p>"This is what I want," she remarked in a rather indiffer-
</p>
<p>ent manner; and putting the pistol in her muff, she left the
</p>
<p>store.
</p>
<p>On returning home, she dressed again, this time in
</p>
<p>most elaborate costume. Her mind appeared perfectly calm.
</p>
<p>She seemed to be in not the slightest hurry. After attend-
</p>
<p>ing to various, little home duties, she went to her boudoir
</p>
<p>desk, read some old letters and wrote the following note :
</p>
<p>"My beloved husband : When I told you this morning of
</p>
<p>my interview with President Monier, who informed me that
</p>
<p>we have in France no law to protect us against the calumnies
</p>
<p>of the press, you said to me that one of these days you would
</p>
<p>smash the face of the ignoble Calmette. I realized that your
</p>
<p>decision was irrevocable. My resolve was then made, . . .
</p>
<p>I shall do justice. France and the Republic need you.
</p>
<p>"I will do the deed.
</p>
<p>"If this letter reaches you, you will know that I have done,
</p>
<p>or tried to do justice. Forgive me, but my patience is
</p>
<p>exhausted.
</p>
<p>"I love and embrace you from the depths of my heart.
</p>
<p>"Your Henriette."
</p>
<p>(Fernand Monier, President of the Tribunal of the Seine,
</p>
<p>later denied he had ever made such a statement.)
</p>
<p>Folding the envelope, Mme. Caillaux called for Miss Bax-
</p>
<p>ter, the English governess of the Caillaux menage, and said
</p>
<p>quietly :

<p>"If I do not return home by seven, give this to my hus-
</p>
<p>6 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>band. But be sure and do not give it to him before then.'*
</p>
<p>As if to remind her mistress, the governess replied:
</p>
<p>''The dinner at the Italian Embassy is tonight, Madame."
</p>
<p>"No, no, I am not going. My husband will understand. I
</p>
<p>am sending his evening clothes to his office."
</p>
<p>Mme. Caillaux again entered her limousine. She drove
</p>
<p>directly to the office of the Figaro. Calmette was not in.
</p>
<p>She said she would wait.
</p>
<p>"It is not necessary to give my name," was her answer to
</p>
<p>the persistent office boy.
</p>
<p>While Mme. Caillaux was waiting, her face buried in her
</p>
<p>furs, her body bent forward, almost crouching, that she
</p>
<p>might even hide the muff that held the revolver, the com-
</p>
<p>positors nearby were putting into type the last Caillaux
</p>
<p>exposure.
</p>
<p>It was the copy of a report made by Public Prosecutor
</p>
<p>Fabre, to the effect that M. Monis, Premier at that time,
</p>
<p>had been requested by Caillaux to postpone the trial of
</p>
<p>Rochette, the notorious swindler. By such delay the charges
</p>
<p>against Rochette would be outlawed.
</p>
<p>Men came and men went. Among them were a florid faced
</p>
<p>individual who evidenced prosperity not only by his diamond
</p>
<p>cuff links, but an aggravated accumulation of fat beneath
</p>
<p>the ears ; and a wiry, nervous man, evidently a poor relation
</p>
<p>of the other, who felt it necessary to keep talking to prove
</p>
<p>his appreciation of his patron's society.
</p>
<p>"I read every word of the Caillaux articles," said the old
</p>
<p>man. "I think the Figaro has already proved that he ought
</p>
<p>to be shot. Why, take that Prieu case. I kept a clipping
</p>
<p>of that. Here, I'll read it to you."
</p>
<p>The fat man was so nearly asleep from the effect of some
</p>
<p>rare old wine he had swallowed with his dejeuner, that he
</p>
<p>failed to interrupt. The old man, taking this silence as a

</p>
<p>good omen, continued:
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 7
</p>
<p>"Here it is. From the Figaro of January 8. The article
</p>
<p>is called, 'The Secret Deals of M. Caillaux.' "
</p>
<p>Looking up from the clipping, the old man said:
</p>
<p>"The point is this. Pierre Prieu was a French merchant
</p>
<p>who went to Brazil in the seventies. He had thirteen vessels
</p>
<p>down there, which Brazil seized. The Brazilians thought
</p>
<p>the ships were smugglers. Prieu put in a claim against the
</p>
<p>Brazilian government. France took over the claim and tried
</p>
<p>to collect. Prieu said the French government got from
</p>
<p>Brazil in 1876, 15,000,000 francs. Prieu tried to get this
</p>
<p>money from France, but couldn't. From 1878 to 1899 he
</p>
<p>kept fighting for his money, but never could get it. His
</p>
<p>direct heir thinking the claim was lost, assigned it to some
</p>
<p>relatives and friends, who formed a syndicate."
</p>
<p>The little woman across the room bent still further over
</p>
<p>her muff. The old man did not see the burning eyes behind
</p>
<p>the veil.
</p>
<p>"Well, here is where Caillaux saw a chance to get some
</p>
<p>more loose gold. No wonder he's one of the richest men in
</p>
<p>France. They formed a syndicate, I said, Fonville, Boileau,
</p>
<p>and Sauvage ; and they hired Auguste Schneider to represent
</p>

</p>
<p>With almost a cry, the woman opposite rose from her
</p>
<p>seat. Again she pleaded with the office boy. "Please tell
</p>
<p>me, when do you think M. Calmette will come?"
</p>
<p>"Any time now," was the laconic reply.
</p>
<p>The fat man did not stir, and the old man continued :
</p>
<p>"Well, that's true. Calmette got the statements of the
</p>
<p>heirs to prove it.
</p>
<p>"Then there was that Credit Egyptien case. I understood
</p>
<p>he made a separate fortune out of that. Caillaux, as Minis-
</p>
<p>ter of Finance, wrote the President of the Council, in De-
</p>
<p>cember, 1908, I think, that the Credit Foncier Egyptien, a
</p>
<p>big financial institution, with head offices in Cairo, should not
</p>
<p>be permitted to place its notices in the bulletins of the
</p>
<p>Journal Officiel. Later through M. Spitzer, a banker of
</p>
<p>international power, Caillaux was made President of the
</p>
<p>administrative council of the Credit Foncier Egyptien, at a
</p>
<p>big salary. Then, and not till then were the 800,000
</p>
<p>shares of the Credit Foncier Egyptien authorized by Cail-
</p>
<p>laux."
</p>
<p>As if scenting her prey, Mme. Caillaux leaped from her
</p>
<p>chair. "M. Calmette has just gone into his office," she
</p>
<p>whispered to the office boy. "Here is my card."
</p>
<p>The boy took one look, and jumped back. Then, slowly,
</p>
<p>and still staring at the card, turning it over and over, and
</p>
<p>still staring at it, he disappeared through the door of the
</p>
<p>inner office.
</p>
<p>There was a companion seated near Calmette, as the boy
</p>
<p>entered.
</p>
<p>"What! Mme. Caillaux?" exclaimed the editor. Looking
</p>
<p>again at the card, he passed it to his friend, who tossed it
</p>
<p>back with the warning:
</p>
<p>"By all means don't see her."
</p>
<p>*'No," replied Calmette. "I cannot refuse to see any
</p>
<p>woman who comes to my office. Bring her in."

</p>
<p>Mme. Caillaux entered. As Calmette was closing the door,
</p>
<p>she fired. The editor fell dying. As he was borne from his
</p>
<p>office, he gave one of the staff of the Figaro his keys, pocket
</p>
<p>book and papers, among which were the documents, that
</p>
<p>contained the details of Caillaux's secret pact with Germany.
</p>
<p>These papers, as Calmette once told M. Bailby, editor of
</p>
<p>Ulntransigeant, he always carried on his person.
</p>
<p>"Take good care of them," said Calmette. "Make it clear
</p>
<p>that I have done my duty."
</p>
<p>The tragedy aroused a storm of controversy throughout
</p>
<p>France. Despite the faithful support of most of his social-
</p>
<p>ist followers, Caillaux was forced to quit the Cabinet. He
</p>
<p>handed his letter of resignation to Premier Doumergue the
</p>
<p>very next morning after the murder.
</p>
<p>A woman's crime saved France. If Caillaux had remained
</p>
<p>in the Cabinet when the Germans were marching on Paris
</p>
<p>four and a half months later, the city finally might have
</p>
<p>fallen into the hands of the commune with Caillaux at its
</p>
<p>head. Proof that he plotted a dictatorship will be presented
</p>
<p>in a later chapter.
</p>
<p>The Master Mind behind the Great Conspiracy, however,
</p>
<p>was by no means without power or resources. The reorgan-
</p>
<p>ized Cabinet still contained Louis Malvy, for long years his
</p>
<p>faithful henchman. Malvy would have been the Trotsky of
</p>
<p>France, had Caillaux been its Lenine. Both had worked to-
</p>
<p>gether in building the Radical Socialist Party into a tre-
</p>
<p>mendously powerful political machine. Both spent vast sums
</p>
<p>for newspaper publicity and propaganda of all kinds. And
</p>
<p>into the treasuries of many of these same newspapers there
</p>
<p>also flowed a constant stream of German gold.
</p>
<p>For a time Caillaux appeared to believe that he could
</p>
<p>overcome the tide of hostile criticism, and that if he were
</p>
<p>successful in obtaining the acquittal of his wife, he might

<p>step back into the Cabinet. At all events he began a care-
</p>
<p>10 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>fully organized campaign to arouse public sympathy for his
</p>
<p>wife, to foment hatred for Calmette, to portray him in the
</p>
<p>newspapers which he controlled as a contemptible dog, that
</p>
<p>would even tear open a woman's heart with its fangs.
</p>
<p>Knowing too well the hysteria of the mob, that it may be
</p>
<p>fanned into a fury or excited to laughter and ridicule by
</p>
<p>sheer stage play, he hired a number of Apaches to attend the
</p>
<p>trials of his wife and applaud or jeer at the command of
</p>
<p>their leader. Another duty of this gang was to accompany
</p>
<p>Caillaux on various occasions as a bodyguard. So bold did
</p>
<p>the band become, that it soon acquired the sobriquet of "the
</p>
<p>Corsican Guard."
</p>
<p>Its chieftain was Almereyda, an Apache, who at eighteen
</p>
<p>entered prison, a thief, and who came out, an anarchist.
</p>
<p>Ever after that his life had been a succession of clashes with
</p>
<p>the police, arrests and imprisonments, amours and sprees,
</p>
<p>the plots of an assassin and the counter plots of a stool
</p>
<p>pigeon.
</p>
<p>Almereyda was usually to be found in the more exclusive
</p>
<p>cafes, which bore the names of French patriots, but were
</p>
<p>owned and managed by Germans. In many of these resorts
</p>
<p>the Berlin spy system had its various places of rendezvous
</p>
<p>in Paris ; for at this time Germany had become so bold, so
</p>
<p>confident of her grip on French politics, French finance,
</p>
<p>French opinion, that her agents worked without any appar-
</p>
<p>ent fear of detection.
</p>
<p>In these same haunts Almereyda ate and drank, most fre-
</p>
<p>quently with some woman of the demi-monde, and always with
</p>
<p>a full purse.
</p>
<p>This then was the kind of man, whom Caillaux hired to
</p>
<p>organize his Corsican Guard, his claque for the court room,
</p>
<p>his mercenaries for various secret errands and mysterious
</p>
<p>missions, which later were discovered by government officials
</p>
<p>to be the errands and the missions of German spies.

</p>
<p>Despite the ugly character of most of his associates,
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 11
</p>
<p>Almereyda believed himself a thorough scholar and gentle-
</p>
<p>man. He had been connected with various anarchistic,
</p>
<p>socialistic journals, and frequently confessed his desire to
</p>
<p>immortalize his name with a series of novels based on the
</p>
<p>next revolution, which he said would overthrow the pluto-
</p>
<p>crats of France within the next few years. Yet he took the
</p>
<p>money and did the bidding of the plutocrat of plutocrats,
</p>
<p>Joseph Caillaux.
</p>
<p>His lean face, in a frame of long, dishevelled hair, his
</p>
<p>wild, burning eyes, his nervous lips were those of a genius,
</p>
<p>which had been cursed by some unexplainably sinister in-
</p>
<p>fluence.
</p>
<p>During these same fateful months of April, May, June
</p>
<p>and July, 1914, Caillaux was also unusually active in the
</p>
<p>direction of various campaigns of the Radical Socialist
</p>
<p>party, which looked to a reapproachment of France with
</p>
<p>Germany and a curtailment of the French military system.
</p>
<p>Both movements are now known to have originated in
</p>
<p>Berlin. One was to allay all French suspicion of Germany's
</p>
<p>war designs ; the other, to render France helpless when the
</p>
<p>Germans were finally ready to attack.
</p>
<p>At the Congress at Pau, the preceding October, the
</p>
<p>Radical Socialists not only made Caillaux president for the
</p>
<p>ensuing year, but they adopted the policy of reducing the
</p>
<p>term of the compulsory army service from three to two
</p>
<p>years. When the first echoes of conflict were heard in the
</p>
<p>Balkans, there were many French socialists who began to
</p>
<p>realize the danger. They protested against the Caillaux plan
</p>
<p>of weakening France, when at the same time Germany and
</p>
<p>Austria were bending every effort toward larger and more
</p>
<p>powerful armaments.
</p>
<p>Viviani was one of these socialists, who rebelled against
</p>
<p>crippling the French army. After Caillaux's followers had
</p>
<p>cried, "Down with the three years' service," at the time when

</p>
<p>Viviani continued the fight and finally succeeded in defeating
</p>
<p>the pacifists and forming a Cabinet committed to the prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of preparedness.
</p>
<p>At last, on June 20, less than a fortnight before the war,
</p>
<p>Mme. Caillaux was brought to trial. Long before the hour,
</p>
<p>a hooting, jostling crowd surged hither and thither in front
</p>
<p>of the great columns of the Palais de Justice. The great
</p>
<p>court room was quickly filled, and then numberless people
</p>
<p>for whom there was no room kept jamming their way in.
</p>
<p>The place seethed with excitement.
</p>
<p>Every class, every type of French society was there. The
</p>
<p>exquisitely dressed royalist, barbered and manicured as for a
</p>
<p>dinner party ; the newly rich bourgeois, aggressive in cos-
</p>
<p>tume, speech, and gesture, to emphasize his belief in his own
</p>
<p>success in the world ; the student from the Latin quarter with
</p>
<p>long hair and great, black, fantastically knotted neck tie ; the
</p>
<p>socialist labor leader, always arguing with somebody ; the
</p>
<p>delicately perfumed, bejewelled, silken lady of the ambassa-
</p>
<p>dorial set ; the gross, painted, bleached, Montmartre cabaret
</p>
<p>singer ; all were there.
</p>
<p>In tight fitting cutaway Caillaux moved from place to
</p>
<p>place, like a stage director. He had even more than his
</p>
<p>ordinary dash and forcefulness. Short, fat, bald, he looked,
</p>
<p>when at ease, like some prosperous and not over intellectual
</p>
<p>tradesman ; but in action his speech and movement evidenced
</p>
<p>great mental power, the power to think and to act quickly,
</p>
<p>to command and to enforce obedience.
</p>
<p>Another crowd, even more motley than the one within,
</p>
<p>clung to the entrance and the great enclosure in front of the
</p>
<p>building, waiting to see Mme. Caillaux arrive from the Con-
</p>
<p>ciergerie. Thither she had been transferred the day before
</p>
<p>from St. Lazare prison. And there she had been placed in a
</p>
<p>large, roomy cell, not far from where Marie Antoinette once
</p>
<p>awaited trial and death.

<p>of the facade to find a good point of vantage, caught a
</p>
<p>signal from a gendarme inside and shouted:
</p>
<p>"They are taking her in by a hidden passage."
</p>
<p>Whereupon the crowd yelled and hooted in a frenzy of
</p>
<p>disappointment.
</p>
<p>As soon as the prisoner entered the court room, a storm
</p>
<p>of applause and handclappings burst upon her, which made
</p>
<p>her seem to shrink into herself all the more. She crouched
</p>
<p>in her chair, until Judge Albanel after the perfunctory pre-
</p>
<p>liminaries began to question her.
</p>
<p>"You are called Genevieve Josephine Henriette Ray-
</p>
<p>nouard, are you not, and you were born Oct. 6, 1874?" he
</p>
<p>asked gently.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," was the faint reply.
</p>
<p>Quietly, hesitatingly, she told the story of her life. She
</p>
<p>was the daughter of a bourgeois family, where the sterner
</p>
<p>precepts of life and of morality were made the foundation of
</p>
<p>France. By these humbler people the Parisian liberte de la vie
</p>
<p>which excuses the faithless husband, the dissolute wife, the
</p>
<p>immoral youth, is believed to be the broad and certain road
</p>
<p>to destruction, infamy and death.
</p>
<p>"For three months I mounted Calvary," she said. "Such
</p>
<p>agony I do not wish my worst enemy. No one can imagine
</p>
<p>what I went through. I feared for myself, my husband, my
</p>
<p>child. I feared for myself, because if part of those letters

</p>
<p>"I was married at nineteen to Leo Claretie. We had two
</p>
<p>daughters. One of them died when she was only six months
</p>
<p>old. The other, Germaine, is now nineteen. A divorce was
</p>
<p>granted in April, 1908, in my favor; and the guardianship
</p>
<p>of our daughter was given to me."
</p>
<p>Behind this testimony lay a picture which the witness did
</p>
<p>not remove from the shadows of the past. It was the pic-
</p>
<p>ture of her first married life. Claretie was a newspaper man,
</p>
<p>for years the literary editor of the Figaro. Through him
</p>
<p>she was lifted out of the common place, narrow life of a
</p>
<p>bourgeois daughter into a different sphere. Through her
</p>
<p>husband she met the brilliant, the powerful men of the day,
</p>
<p>and among them, Caillaux. She saw in Caillaux a road to
</p>
<p>wealth and greatness ; a road that poor Claretie could never
</p>
<p>follow, a road for which she finally abandoned all.
</p>
<p>She spoke of her marriage with Caillaux with pride.
</p>
<p>"He was Premier," she said. ''In marrying him I found
</p>
<p>complete happiness. I thought all would be happy ; but alas
</p>
<p>my life began to be poisoned by calumnies."
</p>
<p>A man with long black hair, who had been sitting as near
</p>
<p>the witness as possible lifted his left hand. Immediately
</p>
<p>there was a chorus of hisses.
</p>
<p>"The campaign against my husband then began. (More
</p>
<p>hisses.) All the people in the salons that I frequented re-
</p>
<p>ceived me with smiles that were intended to wound me. One
</p>
<p>person said behind me that my husband had taken money
</p>
<p>from Germany to cede the Congo. (Prolonged hisses.)
</p>
<p>These slanderous rumors penetrated every part of society.
</p>
<p>I was no longer able to go to sittings of the Chamber of
</p>
<p>Deputies, because I was the object of unpleasant attention in
</p>
<p>the galleries. One day someone shouted :

</p>
<p>"The newspapers read by society were filled with such
</p>
<p>spiteful articles that I was afraid to call on my friends.
</p>
<p>One day at a fashionable dressmaker's, two women sat op-
</p>
<p>posite me. One leaned over to the other and said :
</p>
<p>" 'See that woman in black? Well, that is the wife of that
</p>
<p>thief, Caillaux.' (Hisses.) If I could live a hundred years,
</p>
<p>I should always hear that woman."
</p>
<p>"One day," continued Mme. Caillaux, "in a friend's draw-
</p>
<p>ing room, I heard a woman say, 'Before long some good
</p>
<p>Frenchmen will assume the reins of government and prevent
</p>
<p>France from going into bankruptcy.' I replied:
</p>
<p>" 'My husband is a Minister of the Treasury, a specialist
</p>
<p>in finance. He will not lead France into bankruptcy.' '
</p>
<p>This time, the right hand of the chief claquer was up-
</p>
<p>raised. A volley of cheers swept the court room.
</p>
<p>The first Mme. Caillaux told a different story. A slender
</p>
<p>woman, whose wasted cheeks told of long years of unhappi-
</p>
<p>ness, she revealed Caillaux as a supreme hypocrite, who had
</p>
<p>always practiced dissimulation and intrigue in everything
</p>
<p>he did.
</p>
<p>"I first knew my husband had a mistress," she said, "when
</p>
<p>a certain letter came into my hands. He fell on his knees and
</p>
<p>asked my pardon. He was afraid then that the news would
</p>
<p>get out and hurt his chances at the elections. He promised
</p>
<p>to give up the other woman, but he no sooner promised than
</p>
<p>he went back to her. I found more letters. I kept photo-
</p>
<p>graphic copies. I had to do this to protect myself against
</p>
<p>the Machiavellian manoeuvers of an unfaithful husband.
</p>
<p>But never, never did I give these letters to M. Calmette."
</p>
<p>"Madam Gueydan," said Judge Albanel quietly. "Do
</p>
<p>you swear you told Calmette nothing?"
</p>
<p>"I swear it," cried the woman.

<p>Had the husband deceived his wife? Had he inflamed her

</p>
<p>amid the murmur of whispers in the court room a murmur
</p>
<p>which was instantly hushed when at last the letters were
</p>
<p>produced and exhibited before judge and jury.
</p>
<p>They were written by Caillaux to the woman, who killed
</p>
<p>Calmette, soon after his first wife suspected the liaison. The
</p>
<p>first one read:
</p>
<p>"My dear little Riri: When I first met thee, I felt the
</p>
<p>impulse of my whole being. I should nevertheless have re-
</p>
<p>sisted, and should no doubt have had the courage to conquer
</p>
<p>myself if I had been happy at home. But I was unhappy.
</p>
<p>"Therefore, I threw myself towards thee with passionate
</p>
<p>fury .... With fine courage and with the beautiful boldness
</p>
<p>which love and confidence gave thee, thou hast conquered thy
</p>
<p>freedom, saying to me,
</p>
<p>" *I ask of thee but one engagement, that is, to give me
</p>
<p>thy love now,' and to this thou hast added :
</p>
<p>" 'I shall not believe quite in the fullness of thy love if
</p>
<p>thou dost not succeed some day in thyself becoming free.'
</p>
<p>"I answered thee, I do and will love thee. I certainly ex-
</p>
<p>pect to regain my liberty some day, but in any case I shall
</p>
<p>not move before the elections."
</p>
<p>This line well illustrates how Caillaux put personal ambi-
</p>
<p>tion before love and all things else.
</p>
<p>"Is that not it, my Riri? In the background of my mind
</p>
<p>I knew that I had embarked on a wrong venture, that
</p>
<p>there was between another person and myself such opposition
</p>
<p>of temperaments, of natures, of characters, that catastrophy
</p>
<p>was inevitable; that necessarily time would bring about a

<p>rupture apart from all questions of another love, and as

<p>the sole result of a clash between two beings who did not

</p>
<p>made use of that favorable opportunity.'
</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly the attitude thou suggestest could have
</p>
<p>been taken quite legitimately, but thou forgettest two things,
</p>
<p>first that it would have been well known she was injured in
</p>
<p>her affections and that we had aL to fear from the fury of a
</p>
<p>woman who felt her situation gone, and who had not yet had
</p>
<p>time to reconcile herself to that idea.
</p>
<p>"The second thing thou forgettest is that my electoral
</p>
<p>position was, so to speak, lost. It is easy for me to con-
</p>
<p>vince myself of that by conversations I had yesterday with
</p>
<p>my constituency. . . .
</p>
<p>"Thou wilt say that I am losing a precious opportunity
</p>
<p>and that I shall have a frightful winter. All that is true,
</p>
<p>but it fails to take into account my legitimate political am-
</p>
<p>bitions and, what is much graver, my duty toward party and
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>"Let me explain that my party has made me what I am.
</p>
<p>I owe it as the honest man thou knowest me to be to fight
</p>
<p>for it next year in the fullest of my strength. (Cheers.) It
</p>
<p>will be the last campaign under the old voting system.
</p>
<p>"What is irksome for us both is that for long months we
</p>
<p>shall have to employ extreme precautions. If we had the
</p>
<p>confidence in ourselves and in our love which I have abso-
</p>
<p>lutely, we would not see each other for months. I do not
</p>
<p>propose so radical a solution, because we should both suffer
</p>
<p>too much. But I repeat that infinite prudence is necessary.
</p>
<p>A half way solution thou wilt say. Perhaps so, my Riri, but
</p>
<p>life is not easy to arrange, when one must take so many
</p>
<p>things into consideration, and one to which I hold above all,
</p>
<p>the reputation of a woman one adores.

<p>"P. S. I have reread my letter and it does not completely
</p>
<p>convey my thoughts. What I wish to make absolutely clear
</p>
<p>is the necessity that there shall be no scandal before May
</p>
<p>unless I am absolutely forced to do it. . . ."
</p>
<p>Another letter began:
</p>
<p>"I must return to Le Mans, where I preside over the
</p>
<p>General Council. Were I unreasonable, I would take you
</p>
<p>with me, but I am reasonable. I am discouraged. What a
</p>
<p>life. My only consolation is the thought of you, of having
</p>
<p>you in my arms, as at Cuchy. What delicious memories.
</p>
<p>"I adore you. Thousands and thousands of kisses on all
</p>
<p>your little body, adored."
</p>
<p>Most of the letters were written on the official note paper
</p>
<p>of the Prefecture of the Department of the Sarthe, where
</p>
<p>Caillaux had his country home, and which he represented
</p>
<p>many years as deputy.
</p>
<p>The prisoner sobbed convulsively. She did not raise her
</p>
<p>head until M. Chenu, counsel for the Calmette family, again
</p>
<p>insisted that the editor of the Figaro had no intention of
</p>
<p>printing the letters, and referred to the deposition of Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Poincare, who told how Caillaux had come to him on the
</p>
<p>morning of the day of the murder and said he heard that
</p>
<p>Calmette planned to print a batch of private letters.
</p>
<p>''I replied that I considered M. Calmette an honorable
</p>
<p>gentleman, entirely incapable of publishing letters defaming
</p>
<p>the private character of Mme. Caillaux, but I endeavored
</p>
<p>vainly to convince him," said President Poincare.
</p>
<p>In his final address to the Jury, M. Chenu said:

<p>tenacity to break up her lover's home. You see the result,
</p>
<p>the mistress triumphing over the lawful spouse. They are
</p>
<p>bound up in each other, in their happiness, in their hopes,
</p>
<p>even in their murder plans.
</p>
<p>"M. Caillaux is a man of inordinate and limitless ambition,
</p>
<p>whose power rests on his own audacity and on the fear that
</p>
<p>he inspires. He neglected to tell his wife of the assurance
</p>
<p>given him by President Poincare that Calmette was in-
</p>
<p>capable of printing private letters. They did not fear that.
</p>
<p>What they feared was the publication of the report by Victor
</p>
<p>Fabre on the Rochette swindle and the full exposure of Caill-
</p>
<p>aux's alliance with Germany.
</p>
<p>"The husband's violent words at the luncheon table de-
</p>
<p>cided the wife to substitute herself for him, and she pre-
</p>
<p>pared the assassination with as much calm as a society woman
</p>
<p>fitting in calls between tea parties."
</p>
<p>While M. Labori was summing up for the defense, a man
</p>
<p>and woman left the court room hurriedly. The crowd in the
</p>
<p>doorway stared at her elegant costume, a sheen of black
</p>
<p>silk, and her blazing diamond rings. Her face was almost hid
</p>
<p>under a black picture hat. As soon as the two were apart,
</p>
<p>the man said:
</p>
<p>"Therese, my work here is done. I must return to Berlin
</p>
<p>by the way of Brussels. See Caillaux. The war may break
</p>
<p>tomorrow. Remember, remember the black cross."
</p>
<p>A few hours later Almereyda's band was leading a hostile
</p>
<p>demonstration in front of the Figaro office. Mme. Caillaux
</p>
<p>had been acquitted.
</p>
<p>It was the night of July 28, and while the crowd fought
</p>
<p>in the street, there appeared another news bulletin in omin-
</p>
<p>ously big, black letters :

</p>
<p>Criminal Record Alinereyda, Tool of Caillaux The
</p>
<p>Apaches Revel A Pacifist Reporter
</p>
<p>Later, that same night Almereyda and his Apache follow-
</p>
<p>ers celebrated Caillaux's victory in the back room of his
</p>
<p>socialistic newspaper, the Bonnet Rouge. They had just
</p>
<p>returned from a parade through the Montmartre section in
</p>
<p>which amid mingled cheers and curses they kept shouting:
</p>
<p>"Vive Caillaux" (Hurrah for Caillaux.)
</p>
<p>"Vive la Paix." (We want peace.)
</p>
<p>"A bas la Guerre" (Down with the war.)
</p>
<p>"Well, at last we're here," exclaimed Almereyda, as he
</p>
<p>turned and faced his followers. "We've had some dirty hard
</p>
<p>fights, but we won them all. We helped Caillaux all we could.
</p>
<p>The police were afraid to touch us, and when they did, they
</p>
<p>had to let us go. Why, I'm supposed to be in jail now.
</p>
<p>The man at the top of the department is my friend. When-
</p>
<p>ever you get against the wall, I'll get you out."
</p>
<p>The gang yelled itself hoarse. Its appreciation of Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda's friendship and power was deliriously genuine.
</p>
<p>A table had been set in the middle of the room with wine
</p>
<p>bottles of various shapes stacked behind each plate, and a
</p>
<p>flaming red rose in each glass. Above, from the ceiling, hung
</p>
<p>a great, red flag.
</p>
<p>"Tavera, take that seat over there," said the leader,
</p>
<p>pointing first at the most murderous looking member of his
</p>
<p>retinue, and then at the chair at the end of the table.

</p>
<p>"Here, Roch, sit there."
</p>
<p>"Poggiale, here, here's your place."
</p>
<p>"Fil, Filippi, come up nearer. No, not too near. You're
</p>
<p>drunk, you dog, drunk already."
</p>
<p>It was an ugly assemblage. Everyone had a jail record.
</p>
<p>Their voices, their laughter, their blasphemies, all had a
</p>
<p>prison echo. Besides the five leaders there were many others
</p>
<p>of the same type, also of the Paris underworld, such as you
</p>
<p>might see any night in the corners of certain side street
</p>
<p>cafes, or lurking in the shadows of the boulevards, waiting
</p>
<p>for their woman companions to report, or for the call of
</p>
<p>fellow thieves in some other criminal enterprise.
</p>
<p>They were of the same stratum of society, to which those
</p>
<p>New York Apaches, Lefty Louie, Gyp, the Blood; Harry
</p>
<p>Lewis, and Dago Frank, the gunmen of the Rosenthal case,
</p>
<p>belonged. Their mode of life, their relation to the police,
</p>
<p>their connections with gamblers and the demi-monde of the
</p>
<p>street, were the same.
</p>
<p>The gang did not stand on ceremony. They plunged
</p>
<p>into the dinner headlong, and soon the clatter of wine bot-
</p>
<p>tles, plates, and glasses; the jeers and curses, which more
</p>
<p>and more made conversation impossible; the snatches of
</p>
<p>ribald song, and an occasional thunderous oath from
</p>
<p>Tavera, made the shaky doors and windows fairly rattle.
</p>
<p>Finally, when Filippi fell from his chair with a crash to the
</p>
<p>floor, and two of his companions tumbled him into a comer,
</p>
<p>Almereyda arose and commanded silence.
</p>
<p>"I'm as drunk as any of you," he said slowly, "but I'm
</p>
<p>not too drunk to tell you this. The war has come. It may
</p>
<p>break tomorrow. That means that all of us will go to jail,
</p>
<p>unless we know how to prevent it.
</p>
<p>"We are all in the Carnet B (Notebook B, of the De-

</p>
<p>22 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>is my friend. Malvy nas complete control of the police. He
</p>
<p>has always been the right hand man of Caillaux ; and because
</p>
<p>of what I have done for Caillaux, Malvy will see that Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda and his friends suffer no harm. As a rule, everybody
</p>
<p>in the Garnet B must be arrested before mobilization; but
</p>
<p>Malvy is strong enough to prevent that."
</p>
<p>"Vive Caillaux, Vive Malvy" stammered Filippi, as he
</p>
<p>tried to get up out of the corner. His drunken sally, like a
</p>
<p>spark in a powder keg, set off the whole room in an explosion
</p>
<p>of laughter.
</p>
<p>"Now, let me say, that each of you who worked for Cail-
</p>
<p>laux during the trial gets 500 francs. Come here tomorrow,
</p>
<p>and you get the money. Tavera ought to have a bonus for
</p>
<p>that gendarme he almost killed, and I'll see he gets it."
</p>
<p>"Tavera, Tavera," yelled the crowd, and seeing that his
</p>
<p>fellows would not be satisfied with less, Almereyda turned to
</p>
<p>his chief assassin, and pulling him. out of his chair, demanded
</p>
<p>a speech. Tavera brandished a wine bottle, as if to split
</p>
<p>open his chieftain's head, and then began:
</p>
<p>"We want to stick together. There's a black hell of trou-
</p>
<p>ble ahead. As I was telling you at that cafe near the Chatelet
</p>
<p>subway station, where every morning during the trial we got
</p>
<p>our tickets of admission, we've got to stick together. Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda is not Malvy's friend. He's Malvy's boss. If he tells
</p>
<p>Malvy to open the jails, Malvy opens them. If we stick to
</p>
<p>Almereyda, the war can come. It won't bother us."
</p>
<p>"Vive La Garde Corse," (Hurrah for the Corsican Guard)
</p>
<p>cried Filippi, as he at last succeeded in getting on his feet.
</p>
<p>The interruption irritated Tavera, who retorted:
</p>
<p>''Get back into your hole, you red-eyed dog of a thief.
</p>
<p>You are always a fool, when you're drunk. You'll be killed
</p>
<p>by your bottles, some day."
</p>
<p>Tavera was known to the police as "Tavera, the Assas-
</p>
<p>sin." Originally a card sharp and confidence man, he had

</p>
<p>developed into a highway robber and burglar. Before Alme-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 23
</p>
<p>reyda hired him for Caillaux's Corsican Guard, he had at-
</p>
<p>tained more or less success in gambling houses and other
</p>
<p>resorts, where money was spent freely, by suddenly pulling a
</p>
<p>gun and with the aid of confederates holding up everybody
</p>
<p>else. Tavera was in a class entirely above a sneak thief, like
</p>
<p>Filippi. Most of all he was not a man to be trifled with, and
</p>
<p>Filippi was not too drunk to realize that fact. So Filippi
</p>
<p>dropped back in the corner and out of sight.
</p>
<p>There were other speeches and then the gathering broke
</p>
<p>up slowly. Finally only Almereyda and a youth, who had
</p>
<p>come late, remained.
</p>
<p>"Jean, what news have you got?" asked the Editor in
</p>
<p>Chief. "What is the Figaro saying about us this morning?"
</p>
<p>Jean was a reporter of the Bonnet Rouge.. He had had
</p>
<p>the task of writing many of the articles attacking Calmette
</p>
<p>during the trial, and his work had attracted the notice and
</p>
<p>approval of his employer. Jean was never allowed to be
</p>
<p>present at the meetings of the Corsican Guard, because he
</p>
<p>was thought to be too much of a newspaper man.
</p>
<p>"He's one of 'jhose dogs of a fool, who writes everything
</p>
<p>he knows,' said Tavera once in a flash light analysis of
</p>
<p>Jean's character.
</p>
<p>Jean produced a copy of the Figaro, and Almereyda read
</p>
<p>aloud :
</p>
<p>"The republic is covered with mud and blood by the great-
</p>
<p>est scandal of our epoch. More or less well paid magistrates,
</p>
<p>who aided in the parody of justice, are ineffaceably dishon-
</p>
<p>ored. A powerful man, surrounded by subsidized partisans
</p>
<p>leagued with the political party in power, is above justice
</p>
<p>and the laws.
</p>
<p>"M. Caillaux presided at the trial. He signalled to Judge
</p>
<p>Albanel to adjourn when things were going against him,
</p>
<p>turning the Assize Court into a fair for the sale of con-

<p>those who tried to oppose him."
</p>
<p>24 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"Hah, hah, they still feel the sting of our story about
</p>
<p>Calmette's connection with the Hungarian Government," was
</p>
<p>Almereyda's comment. "Tell me exactly what happened the
</p>
<p>other day, when Caillaux produced Calmette's will and un-
</p>
<p>covered that Hungarian scandal. I was out of the court
</p>
<p>room just then."
</p>
<p>"That was on July 27," replied Jean.
</p>
<p>"Caillaux handed a sheaf of papers to Judge Albanel, and
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>" 'I shall not repeat what I have already told the court
</p>
<p>about the bonds which united the Figaro to certain foreign
</p>
<p>personalities. These documents which I here present in evi-
</p>
<p>dence were signed by Calmette. They show that M. Calmette
</p>
<p>agreed to work for the Hungarian government for pay, that
</p>
<p>he was willing to enter the employ of certain Hungarian
</p>
<p>political leaders. These documents were given me by Count
</p>
<p>Karolyi, chief of the Hungarian radical party.' '
</p>
<p>"That's not what I want to know, my boy," broke in
</p>
<p>Almereyda with more show of irritation. ''Tell me, did you
</p>
<p>hear Lipscher testify?"
</p>
<p>"You mean that Hungarian with the dazzling beauty in
</p>
<p>the big, black picture hat?" asked Jean.
</p>
<p>"Yes, I mean Lipscher. The woman was Therese Duver-
</p>
<p>ger, a kind of international character, who is a link between
</p>
<p>the spy systems of Germany and Austria, and always travels
</p>
<p>with Lipscher. But never mind her. Tell me what Lipscher
</p>
<p>said."
</p>
<p>"I did not hear Lipscher testify," replied Jean.
</p>
<p>"What," exclaimed Almereyda springing from his chair
</p>
<p>with an oath. "Didn't you get his version of that Calmette
</p>
<p>contract? What was the matter with you? Did you not
</p>
<p>know that it was the most important thing in the whole trial
</p>
<p>for us?"

</p>
<p>As he gnashed these words between his teeth, Almereyda
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 25
</p>
<p>worked his fingers nervously, as if ready to choke Jean and
</p>
<p>tear him to pieces.
</p>
<p>"I had to leave the court room to see my wife about that
</p>
<p>time," said Jean. "I must have missed Lipscher."
</p>
<p>"Damn your wife," cried Almereyda. "Don't you know
</p>
<p>you can't have a wife in this business. Now I'll give you
</p>
<p>just one more chance. Go out and get me the Havas New
</p>
<p>York cables of tonight. Get them from some of your friends
</p>
<p>on the other papers. See if Count Karolyi has been located
</p>
<p>in the United States. If you don't get what I want I'll
</p>
<p>discharge you by cutting your throat."
</p>
<p>Jean was an amiable lad, or he would not have meekly
</p>
<p>picked up his hat, and without a word hurried out into the
</p>
<p>dark hall way and down the creaking stairs. He would in-
</p>
<p>deed never have stayed on the Bonnet Rouge, as long as he
</p>
<p>had, if he did not possess a nature, that was wholly faithful
</p>
<p>and long suffering. He had just married, and the needs of
</p>
<p>his little household made him a veritable slave to the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge payroll. Jean was a pacifist by nature. He had
</p>
<p>come to the Bonnet Rouge, because he believed in what he
</p>
<p>thought were its ideals. He had read its articles on univer-
</p>
<p>sal brotherhood and the iniquities of war, and he thought
</p>
<p>he would find in its office the long wished for opportunity to
</p>
<p>devote all his thought and energy to the great cause of peace.
</p>
<p>All too soon Jean was disillusionized. One day in the re-
</p>
<p>ference bureau, he found the following clipping from some
</p>
<p>other Paris newspaper:
</p>
<p>"Almereyda, editor of Caillaux's Bonnet Rouge has a long

<p>Jean also discovered that the editors and reporters who were
</p>
<p>constantly writing the most profound articles on peace, on
</p>
<p>the need of France to become a more economic and less mili-
</p>
<p>tary nation, were the most warlike themselves. He felt like
</p>
<p>calling up Almereyda and resigning over the telephone, but
</p>
<p>again he thought of Marie, of the furniture he had bought
</p>
<p>on the installment plan, of the new dresses Marie wanted, and
</p>
<p>most of all of the other life which was soon to enter his
</p>
<p>home, and he faltered. No, he would stay on the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge just a little while longer.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Almereyda was marching up and down the
</p>
<p>deserted banquet room, kicking the wine bottles that had
</p>
<p>tumbled to the floor, and cursing.
</p>
<p>"Why did I trust that boy Jean with such an important
</p>
<p>assignment?" he kept muttering to himself. "The lad did
</p>
<p>such remarkable work early in the trial, that I let him stay.
</p>
<p>And of course he had to go out to see that baby wife of his,
</p>
<p>just at the most vital time of all."
</p>
<p>Then it occurred to Almereyda, that Jean had done no
</p>
<p>more than his master, who had left the court, not for the
</p>
<p>sake of a loving, faithful wife, but for Madame Z, one of the
</p>
<p>most notorious women in Paris. Madame Z knew that

</p>
<p>Almereyda was a power in the Ministry of the Interior ; and
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 27
</p>
<p>as the police had dared interfere with one of her hotels in the
</p>
<p>Rue de Montyon, she had besought Almereyda's aid.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm just the same fool, that IVe always been,' 1 he
</p>
<p>cried out at last, throwing himself into a chair, and lighting
</p>
<p>another cigarette. ''Wine, woman and drugs have always
</p>
<p>been my foes, have always prevented me from achieving suc-
</p>
<p>cess. With Caillaux and Malvy I should make millions out of
</p>
<p>this coming revolution. German money is all right, but it's
</p>
<p>dangerous and uncertain. What we want is a great coup
</p>
<p>d' etat, in which we can throw out the financiers who now
</p>
<p>rule France, and take their places.
</p>
<p>"But I must get that Lipscher story for Caillaux. Lip-
</p>
<p>scher knew all about Calmette's contract with the Hungarian
</p>
<p>government, a contract which Caillaux wanted to exploit to
</p>
<p>the fullest degree possible to show that Calmette, being tied
</p>
<p>up with Hungary, could not accuse Caillaux of complicity
</p>
<p>with Germany.
</p>
<p>"Then I should have had two other reporters assigned to
</p>
<p>follow Lipscher and the Duverger woman after the trial.
</p>
<p>Lipscher must get back to Berlin before France mobilizes,
</p>
<p>while Mme. Therese stays behind to keep him posted. If so
</p>
<p>she may get to drinking again, and tell all she knows to some
</p>
<p>handsome French captain, who will tip off the military au-
</p>
<p>thorities. Then my influence with Malvy and the Ministry
</p>
<p>of the Interior fails ; and all our plans of keeping up com-
</p>
<p>munication with Berlin through Lipscher will collapse.
</p>
<p>"Ugh, this cigarette is weak as water."
</p>
<p>So saying he threw the smoking butt into a half drained
</p>
<p>wine glass, stripped off his coat, and turned up his sleeve to
</p>
<p>the shoulder. From an inside pocket he took a little black
</p>
<p>bottle and a needle syringe. A minute later he had driven
</p>
<p>the morphine into his veins, and sank back into his chair
</p>
<p>with folded arms.
</p>
<p>The vicious frown which had contracted his features began

</p>
<p>to fade away. A strange smile overspread his face. His
</p>
<p>28 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>eyes became lighted, as by an unseen torch. From his chair
</p>
<p>he rose as lightly as a feather, wafted upward by a puff of
</p>
<p>wind.
</p>
<p>"Now, I'm master of myself at last," he exclaimed, stretch-
</p>
<p>ing out his arms to feel the bouyant strength, with which
</p>
<p>they suddenly seemed to be endowed. "Now I can wade
</p>
<p>through the files and make up a report to Caillaux on all the
</p>
<p>articles we have printed since he first began pushing his plan
</p>
<p>for a reapproachment with Germany and a rupture with
</p>
<p>England.
</p>
<p>''Caillaux gave me 40,000 francs on July 17, three days
</p>
<p>before the trial of his wife began. I am going to prove that
</p>
<p>he should give me still more for this earlier work. Well,
</p>
<p>let's see."
</p>
<p>Shoving aside the dishes and bottles, Almereyda threw a
</p>
<p>file of the Bonnet Rouge on the table, and began making
</p>
<p>notes. The paper had been founded in 1913, and soon after-
</p>
<p>ward the articles began to appear, which were intended to
</p>
<p>make France forget Germany's military designs, and by
</p>
<p>advocating a two year instead of a three year military serv-
</p>
<p>ice weaken her powers of defense.
</p>
<p>Most of them bore the title :
</p>
<p>"Le rapprochement -franco-allemand" (The Franco-
</p>
<p>German reapproachment.)
</p>
<p>Among other editorials he found this special announce-
</p>
<p>ment, and his eyes glistened as he read it again, with all the
</p>
<p>joy of an author who at last sees his thoughts in print.
</p>
<p>"The economic interests of France and Germany are more
</p>
<p>and more closely allied. It has been proved that the idea of
</p>
<p>revenge (arising from the Franco-Prussian war) has been
</p>
<p>abandoned by all the French people, including the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of Alsace and Lorraine, as a monstrosity.

<p>hereditary enemy, the perfidious Albion.
</p>

</p>
<p>"Remember Fachoda, which was for us a far graver injury
</p>
<p>than Agadir.
</p>
<p>''Why then not forget what has happened between us and
</p>
<p>the Germans?
</p>
<p>"The next Chamber of Deputies should have a majority
</p>
<p>favorable to a reapproachment with Germany. Republicans,
</p>
<p>who cherish the ambition of beholding France a great repub-
</p>
<p>lic, merchants who prefer to see the result of their laborg

<p>secure against danger or disaster, yes, all you electors, who
</p>
<p>are all powerful because of the ballot, should force your can-

<p>didates to show where they stand on this question, and only
</p>
<p>vote for those who will bind themselves to work for the real-
</p>
<p>ization of this great plan, this great public good."
</p>
<p>Further on he came across the reprint of a speech he made
</p>
<p>on May 11, 1907, at an anti-militaristic meeting at Rheims
</p>
<p>upon the subject, "Patrie and Caserne." (Country and
</p>
<p>Barracks.) He read as follows:
</p>
<p>"At the present moment, our propaganda should be illus-
</p>
<p>trated by very serious acts. In case of war the proletariat
</p>
<p>should not be satisfied by saying:
</p>
<p>" 'We will not move.'
</p>
<p>''The people must do more than that. They must cause
</p>
<p>a disturbance. The women, the children, the old men must
</p>
<p>go to the railroad stations and prevent the conscripts from
</p>
<p>leaving and advise the reservists not to join the colors.
</p>
<p>"Each fellow countryman should be non-patriotic. It
</p>
<p>should not make any difference to him, whether he is a Ger-
</p>
<p>man or a Frenchman."
</p>
<p>A^mereyda was still reading, when Jean returned. "I
</p>
<p>couldn't get the Havas cablegrams from New York," he said
</p>
<p>quietly. "My friend in the office of Le Petit Parisien said
</p>
<p>that he would be assassinated if he were known to be of any
</p>
<p>aid to the Bonnet Rouge. But I think I got what you want.
</p>
<p>It was cabled by another news service.

</p>
<p>The editor in chief snatched the proof, which Jean took
</p>
<p>30 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>from his pocket, and the moment his eyes fell upon it, he
</p>
<p>cried out in a transport of joy:
</p>
<p>"Magnificent work, Jean. The newspapers of New York
</p>
<p>found Karolyi there, and interviewed him. He completely
</p>
<p>corroborates Caillaux."
</p>
<p>Looking still closer at the slip of paper, Almereyda read:
</p>
<p>"The New York Times of July 28, prints the following
</p>
<p>interview with Count Karolyi, leader of the Hungarian Radi-
</p>
<p>cals:
</p>
<p>'' 'The letters which I turned over to counsel for Mme.
</p>
<p>Caillaux indicated that they were part of prior communica-
</p>
<p>tions and indicated clearly that Calmette had agreed for a
</p>
<p>certain consideration to support the Hungarian government,
</p>
<p>ignoring grafting scandals or applying "whitewash" to any
</p>
<p>exposures that could not be prevented.
</p>
<p>" 'The letters show that an agreement was made between
</p>
<p>Calmette and the representative of the Hungarian govern-
</p>
<p>ment with the cognizance of Secretary of State Jeszenfsky,
</p>
<p>whereby he was to write favorable articles in support of the
</p>
<p>policy of the Hungarian government, although thc'c policy
</p>
<p>was directly opposed to that of his own government, France ;
</p>
<p>and was also in opposition to the friendship existing between
</p>
<p>Hungary and France. Calmette did this work, for the
</p>
<p>favorable articles were brought to my attention, as early as
</p>
<p>a year ago.
</p>
<p>" 'Finally it was shown in the letter of Calmette, that he
</p>
<p>protested against some of the demands made upon him by
</p>
<p>the bribers, for he intimated that certain things the grafters
</p>
<p>wanted inserted in the Figaro were too strong even for its
</p>
<p>editor, when he was receiving pay for it. So he refused to
</p>
<p>comply with some specific things demanded of him.'
</p>
<p>"Count Karolyi also said that Hungary must stand with
</p>
<p>Austria in the present war crisis, as the quarrel between

</p>
<p>them was only economic. The Count said that Caillaux
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 31
</p>
<p>was his friend and that he had given the letters to Caillaux in
</p>
<p>Paris while on his way to the United States."
</p>
<p>Almereyda looked a little further, and then read:
</p>
<p>"The New York Sun of July 28 also prints an interview
</p>
<p>with Count Karolyi, in which he said:
</p>
<p>" 'There were two letters, one from Calmette to the Hun-
</p>
<p>garian government and the other from that government to
</p>
<p>him. They passed through the hands of a third party.' "
</p>
<p>Almereyda embraced the cablegram, as if it were a dancing
</p>
<p>partner, and walzed around the room amid the litter of wine
</p>
<p>bottles, broken dishes, and cigarette stubs.
</p>
<p>"Now, Jean," he said at last, catching himself just as he
</p>
<p>was falling to the floor from dizziness. "One more thing for
</p>
<p>you, and then you can take a rest. Go to the Hotel Ter-
</p>
<p>minus and see if Lipscher is registered there. If so, call
</p>
<p>me up here immediately. Lipscher was the third party, men-
</p>
<p>tioned by Count Karolyi. We must get his complete story
</p>
<p>of this whole affair before he leaves France. Caillaux of
</p>
<p>course knows it and he will want us to use every detail. If
</p>
<p>necessary, spend money, but get the story. If you find him
</p>
<p>taking an early train, jump aboard also. Stick till you get
</p>
<p>everything."
</p>
<p>Jean looked faltering at his master.
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know what's on your mind," laughed Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda, making a feint to hit the reporter with his fist. "You
</p>
<p>want to go home to your doll faced wife. Didn't I tell you,
</p>
<p>a newspaper man had no business to have a wife. Here.
</p>
<p>Here's money for your hotel bill and car fare. And don't
</p>
<p>come back till you get the Lipscher story."
</p>
<p>The pacifism of Jean's nature was at the breaking point.
</p>
<p>He was about to remonstrate, when Almereyda reached out
</p>
<p>his hand and said more quietly.
</p>
<p>"I wish I were as good as you, my boy. You don't know
</p>
<p>what the world is. You believe in peace for the sake of

</p>
<p>32 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>has a false front, that life is one long fight to tear the mask
</p>
<p>off the other man's face, and still keep one on your own.
</p>
<p>"You'll change. I was like you myself, before . . . ,"
</p>
<p>but here he stopped himself. Even the morphine did not
</p>
<p>throw him completely off his guard. Almereyda saw for a
</p>
<p>moment the prison cell which had changed his life, but he
</p>
<p>waved the memory aside and again assuming a harder aspect,
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>''Hurry up, Jean. You have the money you need. Ring
</p>
<p>me up as soon as you get to the Hotel Terminus, and tell me
</p>
<p>if Lipscher is there."
</p>
<p>Jean bowed his head, and went.
</p>
<p>Throwing open the door of another room, Almereyda
</p>
<p>seated himself on a couch and began to undress. He took
</p>
<p>from around his neck a red ribbon from which hung a black
</p>
<p>cross. Placing it under his pillow he stretched out, and was
</p>
<p>dead asleep when the telephone rang at the head of his bed.
</p>
<p>Almereyda reached one arm out of bed, and taking off the
</p>
<p>receiving and transmitting piece, listened.
</p>
<p>"Left an hour ago, did he? All right, chase him. And if
</p>
<p>you don't get that story, remember, I'll kill you."
</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer, the Apache editor in chief

</p>
<p>It was 3 a. m., when Jean reached the Hotel Terminus
</p>
<p>opposite the great St. Lazare railroad station. He found
</p>
<p>only one clue. Lipscher and a woman had left the hotel be-
</p>
<p>tween one and two o'clock in a taxi cab after giving instruc-
</p>
<p>tions that a small, brown, leather trunk should be held at
</p>
<p>the hotel until further instructions. Accordingly, there was
</p>
<p>nothing else to do but watch the trunk. The porter who saw
</p>
<p>them get into the taxi cab had gone home. If he went after
</p>
<p>the porter, Jean thought, he might lose the trunk.
</p>
<p>After calling Marie on the telephone and explaining the
</p>
<p>situation despite such interruptions, as, "Oh, that's awful!"
</p>
<p>"Why do you work so hard?" "Can't they let you come
</p>
<p>home," he slumped into a chair in the lobby and tried to
</p>
<p>rest. He did not dare sleep. The warning of his master still
</p>
<p>rang in his ears. Furthermore, he had the true instinct of
</p>
<p>a reporter, that, if once he left the trail, he would not find it
</p>
<p>again.
</p>
<p>Other thoughts beside Lipscher also worried him. As he
</p>
<p>had come through the Rue St. Lazare, he had seen several
</p>
<p>detachments of soldiers standing within the shadows of the
</p>
<p>station. Now and then a troop of artillery could be heard
</p>
<p>rattling over the pavement of the Boulevard Haussmann a
</p>
<p>few blocks away. Mounted police patrolled the streets. The

<p>84. THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>very atmosphere seemed charged with some terrific force,
</p>
<p>struggling to burst forth, like lightning from a thunder
</p>
<p>cloud.
</p>
<p>As he approached nearer the soldiers, he recognized two
</p>
<p>men whom he had seen in the offices of the Bonnet Rouge, dis-
</p>
<p>tributing circulars. Some of the troops threw them into the
</p>
<p>gutter at first glance. Others read them intently, and then
</p>
<p>carefully folded and tucked them away. One of the pamph-
</p>
<p>lets, which the wind swept down the street, he picked up. It
</p>
<p>was no other than Almereyda's 1907 anti-militaristic har-
</p>
<p>angue at Rheims. Some of the sentences were printed in
</p>
<p>larger and blacker type, as for example:
</p>
<p>"THE PEOPLE MUST DO MORE THAN THAT. THEY MUST
</p>
<p>CAUSE A DISTURBANCE. THE WOMEN, THE CHILDREN, THE OLD
</p>
<p>MEN MUST GO TO THE RAILROAD STATIONS AND PREVENT THE
</p>
<p>CONSCRIPTS FROM LEAVING AND ADVISE 1*HE RESERVISTS NOT
</p>
<p>TO JOIN THE COLORS."
</p>
<p>One of the extras, which he bought from a newspaper
</p>
<p>woman, who still kept open her kiosk despite the fact that it
</p>
<p>was long past midnight, contained these alarming headlines:
</p>
<p>"Austria Declares War at Germany's Bidding."
</p>
<p>"Russia Threatens to Send Army to Aid Servia."
</p>
<p>"Austria's Belligerent Move Resulted From Germany's
</p>
<p>Rejection of Lord Grey's Plan for a Conference of Ambas-
</p>
<p>sadors at London."
</p>
<p>"France Will Not Mobilize Until Every Effort to Prevent
</p>

</p>
<p>Further on in another column Jean found this article:
</p>
<p>"A delegation of Unified Socialists visited M. Bienvenu
</p>
<p>Martin, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, and asked him
</p>
<p>about his interview with Baron von Schoen, the German Am-

</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 35
</p>
<p>"The Socialistic committee had gone to M. Bienvenu
</p>
<p>Martin, because of a meeting of fifty Unified Socialist depu-
</p>
<p>ties earlier in the day. It presented to the Acting Minister
</p>
<p>of Foreign Affairs the resolution adopted by the deputies,
</p>
<p>that intervention by Russia would only extend the evil and
</p>
<p>make German imperialism more aggressive. The resolution
</p>
<p>concluded :
</p>
<p>'* 'France should not become involved in such a formidable
</p>
<p>conflict because of secret treaties.' '
</p>
<p>As Jean sat in the lobby pondering over the startling de-
</p>
<p>velopments of the last twenty-four hours, he said to himself.
</p>
<p>"If we are dragged into this war, I must go to the front.
</p>
<p>What then will poor Marie do? She is soon to be a mother.
</p>
<p>She cannot go out to work. She has no money. I am over
</p>
<p>my head in debt for the furniture for the flat. She'll be
</p>
<p>thrown into the streets. She'll starve. She'll die."
</p>
<p>So saturated had Jean become with all the insidious propa-
</p>
<p>ganda of pacifism, with which the Germans had been flooding
</p>
<p>France for many years before the war, using not only their
</p>
<p>paid agents but a vast number of socialists and dreamers,
</p>
<p>like Jean, who never for an instant realized they were really
</p>
<p>working for the eremy; that in that crucial hour he was
</p>
<p>thinking not of his native land, not of France and all her
</p>
<p>glorious traditions ; but of his own little life. He had for-
</p>
<p>gotten that he owed everything to his country and those
</p>
<p>who had fought and died for it in the heroic past. He did
</p>
<p>not realize that idealistic pacifism is nothing more than
</p>
<p>idealistic selfishness.
</p>
<p>The day dawned, and Jean still waited.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the enemy within, the vast, sinister power of
</p>
<p>Prussian intrigue in all the circles of French life was labor-
</p>
<p>ing unceasingly to weaken and undermine the republic.
</p>
<p>Anarchists, socialists, pacifists were arranging meetings,

</p>
<p>Caillaux was in constant touch with the head of his formid-
</p>
<p>able Radical Socialist party, which held the balance of power
</p>
<p>in the Chamber of Deputies, and threatened to overthrow any
</p>
<p>Premier, who happened to provoke its antagonism.
</p>
<p>Although Caillaux was out of the cabinet, Malvy remained
</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior, and through Malvy Caillaux was
</p>
<p>able to learn the inmost secrets of the government.
</p>
<p>The news which Paris saw on the bulletin boards of July
</p>
<p>29 still further increased the feeling of dire apprehension,
</p>
<p>that some great and fearful tragedy was about to engulf
</p>
<p>the nation. The crowds on the Boulevard Poissonniere, at
</p>
<p>the corner of Rue du Faubourg Poissonniere, where the
</p>
<p>offices of Le Matin are located, almost broke into a riot,
</p>
<p>when some socialists began to cry, "A Bas la Guerre,"
</p>
<p>"Vive Caillaux." Meantime, these bulletins were posted:
</p>
<p>"Austrian Gun BoatsBombard Belgrade."
</p>
<p>"Germany Warns Russia to Halt Army, Yet Prepares for
</p>
<p>War Herself."
</p>
<p>Along the Avenue des Champs Elysees still greater multi-
</p>
<p>tudes assembled to welcome the homecoming of President
</p>
<p>Poincare from Russia. This vast thoroughfare, the broad-
</p>
<p>est and most stately of all the great boulevards of Paris,
</p>
<p>with the vast, looming bulk of the Arc de Triomphe at one
</p>
<p>end and the obelisk of the Place de la Concorde at the other,
</p>
<p>seemed to all who gathered there like an arena where some
</p>
<p>fearful tragedy was soon to be enacted.
</p>
<p>At last President Poincare was seen, bowing to this side
</p>
<p>and that. His face wore a strange, tense look, which at first
</p>
<p>filled the crowd with alarm, but which, as soon as he smiled,
</p>
<p>drove the populace into a frenzy of patriotic fervor, a tem-
</p>
<p>pest of handclappings, cheers, and cries :
</p>
<p>"Vive la France."
</p>
<p>"Vive la Republique."
</p>
<p>"Vive le President"

<p>faced youth, who wore the insignia of the League of Patri-
</p>
<p>ots, organized by a man, who later was to play an extremely
</p>
<p>important part in sending various members of the "Great
</p>
<p>Conspiracy" to traitors' graves. This man was Maurice
</p>
<p>Barres. Even before the war he was constantly at work
</p>
<p>both in and out of the Chamber of Deputies, combatting the
</p>
<p>pestilential forces of Prussian pacifism.
</p>
<p>The day passed. Jean was still waiting at the Hotel Ter-
</p>
<p>minus, when suddenly he was called to the telephone. The
</p>
<p>voice was that of Almereyda.
</p>
<p>"Drop the assignment," it said. "Forget it. Report
</p>
<p>here at 6 p. m.
</p>
<p>"But my wife," cried Jean, before he could catch himself.
</p>
<p>"Ha, ha. Well, put her in a bag and drop her into the
</p>
<p>Seine," laughed Almereyda. "Remember, 6 o'clock."
</p>
<p>Jean reported at 6 o'clock, and all that night toiled away
</p>
<p>over his typewriter, assembling material for another great
</p>
<p>attack against the "militarists" and "imperialists" of
</p>
<p>France.
</p>
<p>At the same time that his faithful followers were crying in
</p>
<p>the streets, "Down with the war," "We must have peace,"
</p>
<p>Caillaux was laying his plans for a great coup d' etat, by
</p>
<p>which he hoped to be the head of a new and socialistic
</p>
<p>France. He expected to rally beneath his standard not
</p>
<p>only the Radical Socialists, the members of his own party,
</p>
<p>including even those of more moderate leanings, but also the
</p>
<p>most extreme and violent exponents of out and out anarchy.
</p>
<p>As a result of the election of May 10, 1914, the 602
</p>
<p>deputies elected for four years, were divided into the follow-
</p>
<p>ing factions:

</p>
<p>The extreme socialist party, with Jaures at his head,
</p>
<p>gained 27 seats. Its opposition to the three year term of
</p>
<p>military service was uncompromising. Like Caillaux's follow-
</p>
<p>ers, the United Socialists favored less powerful armaments.
</p>
<p>The Three Years' Military Service Law was passed by
</p>
<p>the Chamber on July 19, 1913, by 358 votes against 204.
</p>
<p>It repealed the Two Year Law of 1905. Had Caillaux and
</p>
<p>Jaures been successful in their fight against a three year
</p>
<p>service army, in the elections of May 10, 1914, the military
</p>
<p>system of France would have been upset and completely
</p>
<p>demoralized at the very moment that Germany was prepar-
</p>
<p>ing to strike.
</p>
<p>To understand how blind, or worse than blind these social-
</p>
<p>ists were, one need only read the following utterance of
</p>
<p>Jaures, written just before the war:
</p>
<p>"The question of military organization has been the cen-
</p>
<p>ter of the greatest political and social battle that has con-
</p>
<p>vulsed the French democracy for many years. Early in
</p>
<p>1913, tbe government of M. Barthou, taking up a policy an-
</p>
<p>nounced by the short lived Briand ministry called upon
</p>
<p>Parliament to repeal the Two Years' Service Law of 1905
</p>
<p>and again to impose upon the citizens the obligation of
</p>
<p>serving for three years in the so-called active army, the
</p>
<p>army of the barracks. It was supported by all the forces of
</p>
<p>conservatism and reaction, by all the parties of the Center
</p>
<p>and the Right, also, by a notable fraction of the Radi-

<p>cals, ... by all who take their marching orders from the
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 39
</p>
<p>aggressive nationalism of M. Clemenceau, and by all those
</p>
<p>whose hands were tied through the fact that they owed their
</p>
<p>seats to preelection deals with reactionary elements in their
</p>
<p>various districts." (Metropolitan Magazine, Sept., 1914.)
</p>
<p>Little did Jaures dream, when he wrote those words, that
</p>
<p>the day would finally come, when the "aggressive nationalism
</p>
<p>of M. Clemenceau" would save the France, which the Jaures
</p>
<p>and Caillaux socialists did all in their power to weaken.
</p>
<p>Although out of the Cabinet, Caillaux was still a Deputy.
</p>
<p>His faithful constituents in the Department of the Sarthe
</p>
<p>reflected him in spite of the murder of Calmette and all the
</p>
<p>stories of his secret alliances with the traditional enemy of
</p>
<p>France beyond the Rhine. Caillaux still hoped, therefore,
</p>
<p>that, by alliance with the Jaures socialists and other factions
</p>
<p>in the Chamber, he could again dominate France.
</p>
<p>In the rank and file of his party he thought he still held
</p>
<p>the support of that army of small farmers and trades people,
</p>
<p>who had come to believe that the highly centralized and
</p>
<p>bureaucratic government of France was controlled by an
</p>
<p>oligrachy of Paris financiers, and was as despotic, as full of
</p>
<p>favoritism, wire pulling, intrigue and corruption, as the old
</p>
<p>time courts of crowned and sceptered royalty..
</p>
<p>These members of the Radical Socialist party had long
</p>
<p>looked to Caillaux and their other representatives in the
</p>
<p>Chamber of Deputies to protect them against oppression,
</p>
<p>against taxes they believed unfair, against a militarism which
</p>
<p>German propaganda had made them think unnecessarily
</p>
<p>burdensome, against petty bureaucratic abuses and scandals,
</p>
<p>where big interests triumphed over small.
</p>
<p>A considerable part of Caillaux's old following was also
</p>
<p>made up of cafe proprietors and liquor people, who sought
</p>
<p>his championship against the constantly growing sentiment
</p>
<p>inimical to strong drink, against the movement which had

<p>already put an end to the public sale of absinth, and
</p>
<p>40 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>which also demanded the prohibition of all kinds of alcoholic
</p>
<p>beverages, except light wines and beers.
</p>
<p>Added to all these, there was also a powerful contingent
</p>
<p>of office holders, who had first been led to the public trough
</p>
<p>by Caillaux, and thought they could keep their snouts in
</p>
<p>the national treasury, as long as Caillaux and his man,
</p>
<p>Malvy, had a dominating voice in the government. Many
</p>
<p>of these sycophants had even received their money direct
</p>
<p>from Caillaux, money which was called "campaign funds,"
</p>
<p>and which was thankfully accepted without further inquiry.
</p>
<p>For many years Caillaux had been building his house.
</p>
<p>Since 1863, the year of his birth, he had always lived in a
</p>
<p>political atmosphere. He had studied French statecraft
</p>
<p>with grammar and algebra. Wise far beyond his years he
</p>
<p>was always interested most in the financial side of French
</p>
<p>politics. From the very beginning he sought to fit himself
</p>
<p>for the profession of making politics pay.
</p>
<p>His father was a bourgeois banker and man of wealth.
</p>
<p>The elder Caillaux had held political office, and although of
</p>
<p>exclusive tastes and royalist tendences, he supported the
</p>
<p>young republic. The younger Caillaux was by nature much
</p>
<p>more of a royalist than his father, but he saw that the days
</p>
<p>of the throne and ermine, of absolutism in its outward and
</p>
<p>traditional forms, had passed away and in its place had
</p>
<p>come the absolutism of v/ealth.
</p>
<p>A plutocrat of plutocrats, Caillaux became a socialist of
</p>
<p>socialists. Secretly connected with the greatest financiers
</p>
<p>of France and Germany, he publicly appeared as the friend
</p>
<p>of the poor and the down trodden. Living in palatial style,
</p>
<p>the host at extravagantly sumptuous dinners, to which he
</p>
<p>invited the most exclusive of aristocracy, he also was to be
</p>
<p>found in the ill-smelling corridors of the headquarters of the
</p>
<p>Radical Socialists, the "Salons de Valois," as the sign read
</p>
<p>over the door. But always he kept on his gloves. Always he

<p>walked so fast that the herd never had a chance to clasp

</p>
<p>even his gloved hand. Nevertheless, he was popular.
</p>
<p>Gloves or no gloves, his fingers always dispensed money.
</p>
<p>Down in the Department of the Sartbe, which Caillaux
</p>
<p>represented in the Chamber of Deputies as soon as he begun
</p>
<p>his political career, his power was absolute. He saw to it
</p>
<p>that his constituency obtained all the favors within reach;
</p>
<p>that new roads and new bridges were built, and old roads and
</p>
<p>old bridges repaired ; that handsome public buildings were
</p>
<p>erected, even though more expensive and more ornate than
</p>
<p>occasion demanded; that badges and medals were forthcom-
</p>
<p>ing for all who wanted them, that the wives and the
</p>
<p>children were remembered in many pretty ways ; that, in
</p>
<p>brief, the Department of the Sarthe got as much out of the
</p>
<p>national strong box as Caillaux could possible extract.
</p>
<p>Thus it happened, that even despite all the scandals with
</p>
<p>which his later life was clouded, the Department of the
</p>
<p>Sarthe kept him in the Chamber of Deputies. At Mamers,
</p>
<p>his country home, his constituents refused to believe the
</p>
<p>ugly stories some newspapers printed about him. There
</p>
<p>were a few, even, who never, never would be convinced that
</p>
<p>Mme. Caillaux killed Calmette.
</p>
<p>"It was all a lie, the work of political enemies. Calmette
</p>
<p>simply went into hiding," they insisted.
</p>
<p>Caillaux's fortune dated back to his first years in the
</p>
<p>Chamber, and it seemed to grow by leaps and bounds ever
</p>
<p>since that time. At the trial of his wife, he asserted that he
</p>
<p>had inherited 1,200,000 francs, and that his wealth had
</p>
<p>never increased. There are others who say that at the height
</p>
<p>of his power, Caillaux's riches were ten to twenty times
</p>
<p>greater than his own estimate.
</p>
<p>Caillaux's rise had been continuous. He was first an
</p>
<p>inspector of finances, and later under the Premiership of
</p>
<p>Waldeck-Rousseau, he became Minister of Finance. From
</p>
<p>that time on Caillaux tried to keep his hands on the money

</p>
<p>other Premiers and he kept this portfolio during his own
</p>
<p>Premiership. At one time, according to Calmette and the
</p>
<p>Figaro, he juggled the income tax question in such fashion
</p>
<p>as to cause tremendous fluctuations in rentes on the Paris
</p>
<p>Bourse, as the result of which his friends are said to have
</p>
<p>reaped millions.
</p>
<p>Upon such a foundation, Caillaux hoped finally to become
</p>
<p>the master of France. He schemed to let German aggres-
</p>
<p>sion overthrow everything else and lift him to the supreme
</p>
<p>heights of his imperial ambition.
</p>
<p>Papers in a safe deposit box, which Caillaux rented in the
</p>
<p>Banca Italiana di Sconto, in Florence, Italy, and seized by
</p>
<p>the Italian police years afterward, now make it possible to
</p>
<p>reveal his plans of a great coup d' etat in considerable detail.
</p>
<p>First of all, the socialists in the army were to mutiny and
</p>
<p>demand that Caillaux become First Consul. On assuming
</p>
<p>this office, he intended to throw aside old time conventions
</p>
<p>and order the arrest of all antagonistic to his rule. Among
</p>
<p>the names of those doomed to immediate imprisonment were
</p>
<p>found those of President Poincare, and the two former
</p>
<p>Premiers, Clemenceau and Briand.
</p>
<p>To accomplish the destruction of Poincare and Clemen-
</p>
<p>ceau, Caillaux had obtained various documents from the
</p>
<p>Surete Generate, or secret service bureau of the Depart-
</p>
<p>ment of the Interior, of which his henchman, Malvy, had
</p>
<p>charge. Such documents are known in France as the "pink
</p>
<p>papers." They include the confidential reports of detectives
</p>
<p>assigned to special investigations, the reports of police con-
</p>
<p>cerning the movements of suspects, and all other information
</p>
<p>from every source to uncover crime or unmask the wiles of
</p>
<p>intrigue and corruption.
</p>
<p>Among the "pink papers" may also be found all manner
</p>
<p>of correspondence, as for example anonymous complaints
</p>
<p>against public officials from enemies who wish to attack them

<p>in this secret and insidious way.
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 43
</p>
<p>The "pink papers" relating to President Poincare, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to La Verite, a socialistic organ, which defended Cail-
</p>
<p>laux, gave alleged details of an agreement, by which the
</p>
<p>President's civil marriage would be consecrated, if in return
</p>
<p>he would work for the re-establishment of relations be-
</p>
<p>tween France and the Vatican. There were negotiations,
</p>
<p>La Verite asserted, in which M. Klotz, Stephen Pinchon and
</p>
<p>ex-Ambassador Tittoni used a cipher, the key of which was
</p>
<p>lost by the Ministry of the Interior. President Poincare
</p>
<p>and all the other men mentioned in this affair have stamped
</p>
<p>this story as false.
</p>
<p>Against Clemenceau Caillaux was said to have gathered to-
</p>
<p>gether various charges which relate to Clemenceau's visit to
</p>
<p>London during the Waldeck-Rousseau ministry. Clemen-
</p>
<p>ceau was to be painted by Caillaux, as the servant of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, the man who planned to make France, a British vassal.
</p>
<p>The attack against Clemenceau was to harmonize completely
</p>
<p>with the anti-British, pro-German policy which Caillaux had
</p>
<p>been fostering in every possible way in France long before
</p>
<p>the war.
</p>
<p>In the Cabinet, which Caillaux planned, Malvy was to en-
</p>
<p>joy still greater power. The Prefecture of Police, vitally
</p>
<p>important in suppressing counter revolution, was to be
</p>
<p>given to M. Cecaldi, one of Caillaux's counsel at the Cal-
</p>
<p>mette murder trial. A number of Generals, which had par-
</p>
<p>ticularly distinguished themselves, were to be side-tracked,
</p>
<p>and Gen. Sarrail was to be put in complete charge of the
</p>
<p>army.
</p>
<p>Why General Sarrail? When the war became blackest
</p>
<p>for the Allies, was not General Sarrail suddenly removed
</p>
<p>from command of the French Army in Macedonia? To
</p>
<p>answer these questions, it will be necessary in a later chapter
</p>
<p>to consider the charges made by Leon Daudet, editor of the
</p>
<p>royalist paper, L 9 Action Fran^aise, that certain vitally im-

<p>quarters, found their way into the hands of a Caillaux
</p>
<p>editor, from whom they were said to have travelled to a
</p>
<p>Mannheim banker, stationed in Switzerland, and thence to
</p>
<p>the Kaiser.
</p>
<p>In his dream of empire Caillaux planned to curtail the
</p>
<p>power of Senate and Chamber of Deputies, by compelling
</p>
<p>them to 'enact a measure making him a virtual dictator.
</p>
<p>On July 30, the day after President Poincare's return
</p>
<p>from Russia, Caillaux and Malvy were still more frequently
</p>
<p>in consultation. It was on this day also that Malvy issued
</p>
<p>a statement, which at the time seemed harmless, but which
</p>
<p>in the light of later events assumed a tragic significance.
</p>
<p>There had been a meeting of the Cabinet, at which Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Poincare presented the Russian situation in much de-
</p>
<p>tail. Reports were also read which indicated that Germany
</p>
<p>was moving heaven and earth in her preparations for strik-
</p>
<p>ing not only Russia but France. The meeting was in secret,
</p>
<p>and each one present was pledged to preserve secrecy.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, immediately afterward, Minister of the Interior
</p>
<p>Malvy permitted himself to be quoted as follows :
</p>
<p>"We have received news from Germany for which we did
</p>
<p>not dare to hope. The situation is now better than has
</p>
<p>generally been supposed. It is possible to foresee a moment
</p>
<p>when negociations may enter upon a way leading to a favor-
</p>
<p>able solution of the whole matter."
</p>
<p>The next day, July 31, the news bulletins became still
</p>
<p>more alarming. While Jean was still toiling over his type-
</p>
<p>writer in the Bonnet Rouge office, Almereyda entered with
</p>
<p>an extra on which were blazoned these ominious headlines :
</p>
<p>"Germany in State of War."
</p>
<p>"British Fleet Off for North Sea."
</p>

</p>
<p>The Apache editor in chief threw the paper on the floor
</p>
<p>and stamping on it, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>"Let the war come. It will be a great knife, which will
</p>
<p>cut out the old, dead wood in France, and help us build this
</p>
<p>nation anew. We will have a great socialistic state, and the
</p>
<p>friends of Caillaux will be supreme."
</p>
<p>"How about the arrest of all those in Garnet B?" asked a
</p>
<p>shaggy headed youth, who was trying to puff a cigarette, so
</p>
<p>short that it fairly burned his fingers. "Does the gang go
</p>
<p>to jail?"
</p>
<p>"Nobody goes to jail," laughed Almereyda. "I have seen
</p>
<p>Malvy about that."
</p>
<p>As his Apache visitor left the room, Almereyda took out
</p>
<p>of his desk a paper, from which he poured a little white
</p>
<p>powder upon a thumbnail, and sniffed it like snuff. It was
</p>
<p>his regular afternoon potion of cocaine. Jean could not
</p>
<p>help but see it all, and shuddered. There was something so
</p>
<p>diabolical, so supernaturally evil about the man. Almereyda
</p>
<p>caught Jean's almost frightened glance, and called him to
</p>
<p>his desk with unusual gruffness.
</p>
<p>"Forget that Lipscher affair," he muttered. <d Don't
</p>
<p>ever speak to anyone about either Lipscher, or the woman.

<p>Within the next few hours France was plunged deep in the
</p>
<p>conflict. On August 1, 1914, Germany declared war on
</p>
<p>Russia. She had already begun her attack on France.
</p>
<p>Throughout all the highways and byways, on land and sea,
</p>
<p>the armed forces of the Republic were mobilizing. The
</p>
<p>drum beat and the strains of the Marseillaise were heard on
</p>
<p>every side. All the traditional heroism of the French na-
</p>
<p>tion the same spirit that marched to victory beneath the
</p>
<p>imperial colors of Napoleon that had also emerged tri-
</p>
<p>umphant from the throes of revolution burst forth now in
</p>
<p>all its old time glory.
</p>
<p>The patriotism of the French people was aroused to such
</p>
<p>a fury, that the anarchists and pacifists seemed overawed.
</p>
<p>Their plans for an "anti imperialistic" revolt were for the
</p>
<p>time abandoned. German agents, spies, communists, and all
</p>
<p>the rest of this same ilk, were indiscriminately swallowed up
</p>
<p>in the great military machine, which had sprung up over
</p>
<p>night.
</p>
<p>The assassination of Jaures, the great Unified Socialist
</p>
<p>leader alarmed not only his party followers, but also many
</p>
<p>other anti militarists with the fear of a like fate. On the

<p>night of July 31, he was dining with several members of
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 47
</p>
<p>the staff of U Humanite, of which he was editor, in the
</p>
<p>Croissant, a famous restaurant near the Bourse. The party
</p>
<p>sat at a table near an open window facing the Rue Mont-
</p>
<p>martre. Suddenly, a hand holding a revolver was thrust in
</p>
<p>through the window from the street and, before anyone could
</p>
<p>seize the gun, it fired two bullets into the back of the social-
</p>
<p>ist leader's head. Without hardly more than a moan Jaures
</p>
<p>fell forward upon the table. He died within a few minutes.
</p>
<p>The assassin was Raoul Villain, a clerk of the civil court at
</p>
<p>Rheims. From his actions and utterances, he was thought
</p>
<p>to be demented. His mother for twenty years had been an
</p>
<p>inmate of an insane asylum.
</p>
<p>"I killed Jaures, because he betrayed the country in lead-
</p>
<p>ing the campaign against the three year military law," he
</p>
<p>said. "I believe one must punish traitors, and if I can give
</p>
<p>my life to such a cause, I shall feel my duty has been accom-
</p>
<p>plished. I do not belong to any revolutionary or reactionary
</p>
<p>league. To kill Jaures was my own idea."
</p>
<p>For a time, it was feared that the Socialists in a revulsion
</p>
<p>of feeling might precipitate a governmental drisis, but
</p>
<p>Premier Viviani warded off the storm by taking immediate
</p>
<p>precautions. In a statement, which he issued the same night,
</p>
<p>he said:
</p>
<p>"A most abominable crime has been committed. M. Jaures
</p>
<p>was a statesman and orator who gave distinction to the
</p>
<p>Chamber of Deputies. He has been assassinated in the most
</p>
<p>cowardly way, and personally and on behalf of my Colleagues
</p>
<p>I bow before the tomb so suddenly opened for this Socialist
</p>
<p>Republican, who struggled for such noble causes and who in
</p>
<p>trying times patriotically sustained the authority of the
</p>
<p>Government in the interest of peace."
</p>
<p>In this hour only words of praise for the dead socialist
</p>
<p>were heard. It was realized, even by his most bitter critics,
</p>
<p>that his pacifism was that of an idealist, even though it had

</p>
<p>played into the hands of the foes of France.
</p>
<p>When Caillaux heard of the death of Jaures, he took even
</p>
<p>greater precautions to guard himself against similar attack.
</p>
<p>The servants in his house were instructed to keep constant
</p>
<p>watch, lest a stranger work his way in under cover of some
</p>
<p>specious pretext, and try to assassinate the master. Cail-
</p>
<p>laux was thought by many to have left Paris for his country
</p>
<p>place at Mamers.
</p>
<p>Malvy, Caillaux's dummy in the Ministry of the Interior,
</p>
<p>found it necessary therefore to assume outwardly at least
</p>
<p>the responsibilities and duties of his chief. At the same time
</p>
<p>that Caillaux hid himself more and more from public view.
</p>
<p>Malvy became more and more active in the open. Malvy
</p>
<p>tried to hold together, as best he could, the demoralized
</p>
<p>forces of the Caillaux faction. He kept in constant touch
</p>
<p>with Almereyda, the chieftain of the Caillaux's body guard,
</p>
<p>and many others who were secretly spreading the pestilence
</p>
<p>of hatred and falsehood, of pacifism and defeatism, and who
</p>
<p>were ever ready to join in a socialistic revolution, that would
</p>
<p>make Caillaux the ruler of France.
</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior is almost within stone's throw
</p>
<p>of the Elysee Palace, where lives the President of France.
</p>
<p>It is a irregularly shaped building with one wing facing on
</p>
<p>the Rue des Saussaies and another on the Rue Cambaceres.
</p>
<p>From the corner windows of the President's palace, look-
</p>
<p>ing out on the Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore, one can al-
</p>
<p>most see down the Rue Combaceres and recognize the visitors
</p>
<p>at the Ministry of the Interior, that go and come by this
</p>
<p>route.
</p>
<p>Here President Poincare, had he known at that time all
</p>
<p>the plottings of the enemies of France within her own bord-
</p>
<p>ers, could have seen Almereyda on the day, when all France
</p>
<p>was arming for the war, hurrying through the crowd, and
</p>
<p>at last disappearing behind the portals of the neighboring
</p>
<p>building, where Malvy, the Caillaux viceroy, ruled supreme.

<p>The doorkeeper, the sentries, all the petty officials that
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 49
</p>
<p>lie between the outside sidewalk and the deeply recessed cham-
</p>
<p>ber, in which the Minister kept himself in stately seclusion,
</p>
<p>knew Almereyda, and let him pass by with a bow of welcome.
</p>
<p>They saw only his smartly tailored clothes, his quick, eager
</p>
<p>stride, his searching eyes, and shaggy hair. They had come
</p>
<p>to understand, that he was a particular friend of their
</p>
<p>chief, and to their minds that qualification furnished all the
</p>
<p>necessary credentials. They noticed that he was never kept
</p>
<p>waiting in the outside office, that he came and went at all
</p>
<p>hours, and sometimes carried to and fro under his arm, what
</p>
<p>appeared to be the documents of the office, as if they were
</p>
<p>his own.
</p>
<p>The interview between Malvy and Almereyda at this time
</p>
<p>determined the fate of more than 2,500 anarchists and anti
</p>
<p>militarists, whose names were listed in the Garnet B.
</p>
<p>The conversation behind the closed doors of Malvy's inner
</p>
<p>office can now be reproduced from documents in the pos-
</p>
<p>session of the present French government.
</p>
<p>"I understand that Clemenceau and some others want the
</p>
<p>Garnet B crowd sent to prison," said Almereyda.
</p>
<p>"Yes, I am being urged to carry out the old law," replied
</p>
<p>Malvy. "So far, I have taken no action."
</p>
<p>"You must arrest no one. You must issue an order to
</p>
<p>[that effect at once."
</p>
<p>And Malvy issued the order.
</p>
<p>In Garnet B was Almereyda's own name, and marked
</p>
<p>against it was his long criminal record. There too were the
</p>
<p>names of all of Caillaux's Corsican Guard, of Sebastien
</p>
<p>Faure, and over two thousand more plotters against France.
</p>
<p>All were permitted to go free, and in the army, the navy,
</p>
<p>in the trenches, among the reserves, or in various spheres of
</p>
<p>civil life, they were still able to work for the triumph of the
</p>
<p>foe.
</p>
<p>During the next ten days, the German guns began pound-

</p>
<p>ing to pieces the fortresses of Liege, and the Kaiser was
</p>
<p>50 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>massing still greater armies for the thrust through Belgium
</p>
<p>into France. Every hour the situation in Paris became more
</p>
<p>critical. The French armies were being stationed in the
</p>
<p>most strategic places to meet the enemy's advance, which, if
</p>
<p>it could not be checked, would permit the Huns to beseige
</p>
<p>Paris. At this time any information transmitted to the Ger-
</p>
<p>mans concerning the plans of the French military leaders,
</p>
<p>might permit the enemy to triumph at the very onset.
</p>
<p>The military police, accordingly, became most active.
</p>
<p>They tried to round up all who might be suspected as spies
</p>
<p>or as interfering in any way with military operations. They
</p>
<p>picked up not a few of the criminals, which Malvy's civil
</p>
<p>police had allowed to go free.
</p>
<p>Almereyda made another hurried visit to Malvy's inner
</p>
<p>office. He protested. He insisted that the men who had
</p>
<p>been thrown into prison were innocent, that such arrests
</p>
<p>were in violation of the promises which Malvy had made
</p>
<p>when the war began.
</p>
<p>"They are my friends, I will vouch for them," said Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda.
</p>
<p>The appeal of the King of the Apaches met with instant
</p>
<p>approbation at the Ministry of the Interior. A note was
</p>
<p>dictated, bearing date of August 10, 1914, accompanying a
</p>
<p>list of names which Almereyda had submitted to Malvy
</p>
<p>and transmitted to M. Laurent, Prefect of Police, which
</p>
<p>read:
</p>
<p>"It would be desirable that the persons who figure in this
</p>
<p>list and for whom M. Almereyda, who is trustworthy, can
</p>
<p>answer, be set free as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>And at once the gang was liberated.
</p>
<p>During all this time Malvy and Caillaux were in constant
</p>
<p>communication. Ever since he took an important part in
</p>
<p>politics, Malvy had never been more than Caillaux's tool.
</p>
<p>He was the type of man, who believes that success results

</p>
<p>easiest from following another who possesses greater power,
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>and, if possible, some day succeeding to that power. In the
</p>
<p>ward politics of Tammany Hall he would be popularly known
</p>
<p>as an "organization man." He was younger than Caillaux,
</p>
<p>more modest, but just as ambitious.
</p>
<p>Caillaux found early that Malvy could be trusted in the
</p>
<p>various coups, which Caillaux executed with such dexterity
</p>
<p>as to mystify the outside public completely. Malvy was per-
</p>
<p>mitted to know how the trick was done. Malvy was a good
</p>
<p>wirepuller, a good fixer. He could be commissioned by
</p>
<p>Caillaux to this or that confidential mission, and his master
</p>
<p>felt assured that all the details would be carefully at-
</p>
<p>tended to.
</p>
<p>Malvy also spared Caillaux the task of shaking hands with
</p>
<p>the common herd, a task which Caillaux abhorred. Malvy
</p>
<p>met the "boys" in the headquarters of the Radical Social-
</p>
<p>ists, brought them Caillaux's messages and Caillaux's francs.
</p>
<p>If Malvy made any money out of politics, he apparently
</p>
<p>did not keep it. He confessed freely to all his friends, that
</p>
<p>he loved the card table and the roulette wheel altogether too
</p>
<p>much. Many times, when he came in the morning to his
</p>
<p>office, pale and haggard, and hardly more than looked at his
</p>
<p>mail before hurrying away to dejeuner and an afternoon
</p>
<p>sleep, he would casually explain that he had been gambling
</p>
<p>all night long, and had lost.
</p>
<p>In the street Malvy always sought the opportunity . of
</p>
<p>greeting friends. At times when Caillaux would ride past
</p>
<p>his constituents behind the drawn curtains of his limousine,
</p>
<p>with a body guard of Almereyda's Apaches before and be-
</p>
<p>hind, Malvy would stroll along the sidewalk, bowing and
</p>
<p>smiling to all who recognized him and returned his words of
</p>
<p>greeting.
</p>
<p>Malvy, like Caillaux, had behind him the powerful follow-
</p>
<p>ing of the Radical Socialists. He had also the sympathy of
</p>
<p>the Unified Socialists, who represented the labor unions, the

<p>working men, and the anti capitalists.
</p>
<p>52 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>As Minister of the Interior, Malvy controlled the police
</p>
<p>machinery throughout France. The prefects of police were
</p>
<p>his subordinates. The Surete Generate, or secret service
</p>
<p>bureau, which contains most of the skeletons from the closets
</p>
<p>of everybody, who builds houses with secret closets, was also
</p>
<p>under his immediate control. Its director was also a sub-
</p>
<p>ordinate of the Minister of the Interior.
</p>
<p>Having all this power in his hands, Malvy was able to
</p>
<p>exert a tremendous influence in elections, and there were
</p>
<p>many scores of Deputies who felt they owed him more than
</p>
<p>a vote of thanks. So popular had he become among the lead-
</p>
<p>ers of his own party, that they demanded his retention in the
</p>
<p>Cabinet, no matter who might be the Premier. He, there-
</p>
<p>fore, served, as Minister of the Interior, in the war Cabinet
</p>
<p>of Viviani, the coalition Cabinet of Briand, and the cen-
</p>
<p>tralized Cabinet of Ribot. He did not fall until Clemenceau,
</p>
<p>braver than any of his predecessors, tore the mask from his
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>Meantime, the tide of war was rolling ever nearer Paris.
</p>
<p>On August 20 the Germans had crashed through the first
</p>
<p>defenses of Belgium, forcing the Belgian line to fall back
</p>
<p>on Louvain. King Albert and his court, with all the state
</p>
<p>departments and state archives, had fled from Brussels to
</p>
<p>Antwerp. Brussels fell into the hands of the enemy and the
</p>
<p>Germans redoubled their attacks in the drive toward Paris.
</p>
<p>By September 5 the First German Army, pouring into
</p>
<p>France from the north, was making every possible effort to
</p>
<p>turn the French left. Francis A. March, in his "History of
</p>
<p>the World War," has described the situation in France during
</p>
<p>this crisis, as follows:
</p>
<p>"The First Germany Army, carrying audacity to temer-
</p>
<p>ity, had continued its endeavor to envelop the French left,
</p>
<p>had crossed the Grand Morin, and reached the region of

<p>Chauffry, to the south of Rebais and of Esternay. It aimed
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 53
</p>
<p>then at cutting Joffre off from Paris, in order to begin the
</p>
<p>investment of the capital.
</p>
<p>"The Second Army had its head on the line Champaubert,
</p>
<p>Etoges, Bergeres, and Vertus.
</p>
<p>"The Third and Fourth Armies reached to Chalons-sur-
</p>
<p>Marne and Bussy-le-Repos. The Fifth Army was advancing
</p>
<p>from the Argonne as far as Triaucourt-les-Ilettes and Juive-
</p>
<p>court. The Sixth and Seventh armies were attacking more to
</p>
<p>the East.
</p>
<p>"The French left army had been able to occupy the line
</p>
<p>Sezanne, Villers-St. Georges and Courchamps. This was
</p>
<p>precisely the disposition which the General in Chief had
</p>
<p>wished to see achieved. On the 4th he decided to take ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of it, and ordered all the armies to hold themselves
</p>
<p>ready. On the evening of the 5th, he addressed to all the
</p>
<p>commanders of armies a message ordering them to attack.
</p>
<p>" 'The hour has come,' he wrote, 'to advance at all costs
</p>
<p>and to die where you stand rather than give way.' '
</p>
<p>Then followed the First Battle of the Marne, in which
</p>
<p>during seven days of heroic fighting, the French broke
</p>
<p>through the advanced lines of the Germans and driving them
</p>
<p>back in disorder, saved Paris, and recaptured half of the in-
</p>
<p>vaded districts of northeastern France.
</p>
<p>During these lurid days, when the fate of the French
</p>
<p>Republic hung in the balance, Caillaux remained in Paris.
</p>
<p>The President and Cabinet, all the departments of govern-
</p>
<p>ment, the governmental records, and most of the men of
</p>
<p>wealth and their families had sought refuge in Bordeaux.
</p>
<p>For the time being the chief seaport of the Bay of Biscay
</p>
<p>had become the capital of France.
</p>
<p>But Caillaux remained behind. Even when the German
</p>
<p>guns had reached Conesse, only twelve miles away from the
</p>
<p>outskirts of Paris, Caillaux lingered. He stayed but to see
</p>
<p>the Germans defeated, the Hun tide of invasion turned back,

<p>the "contemptible British Army" holding the foe with uncon-

<p>54 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>querable heroism, the plans of a socialistic revolution aban-
</p>
<p>doned by even the most daring of his followers, and his own
</p>
<p>life in still greater jeopardy. Meantime, he entered the
</p>
<p>army, as a paymaster.
</p>
<p>On October 22, 1914, Caillaux and his wife were riding
</p>
<p>in an open cab along the Boulevard des Capucines which lies
</p>
<p>between the great, columned Church of the Madeleine, and
</p>
<p>the Opera. On either side were gathered the usual crowds,
</p>
<p>which even in spite of the war assembled on the sidewalks in
</p>
<p>front of the cafes and brasseries for an afternoon glass of
</p>
<p>wine or a cup of coffee.
</p>
<p>As they were about to turn into the Place de la Opera,
</p>
<p>where a half dozen boulevards and avenues converge like the
</p>
<p>spokes of a gigantic wheel, someone recognized Caillaux, and
</p>
<p>the news spread like wildfire. Many of the spectators
</p>
<p>did not know that Caillaux had gone into the army, until
</p>
<p>they saw him riding past them in the full uniform of an
</p>
<p>army paymaster. His wife wore the white armlet of the
</p>
<p>Red Cross. Of a sudden a woman cried :
</p>
<p>"Voila Caillaux, T espion Allemand"
</p>
<p>(There is Caillaux, the Germany spy.)
</p>
<p>The multitude surged toward the Caillaux carriage as if
</p>
<p>to seize its occupants and drag them through the streets.
</p>
<p>Caillaux protested, but the crowd only become the more
</p>
<p>furious.
</p>
<p>"A bas Caillaux." "Mort pour V espion Allemand" "Mort
</p>
<p>pour le traitre" (Down with Caillaux) (Death for the Ger-
</p>
<p>man spy) (Death for the traitor) were some of the cries which
</p>
<p>greeted the man, who once was Premier of France.
</p>
<p>From somewhere a volley of dirt picked up from a pile of
</p>
<p>refuse in a back areaway fell upon Caillaux and his wife, and
</p>
<p>amid the storm of missies a filthy, long bundle of rags, such
</p>
<p>as are used to turn the water to right or left when flushing
</p>
<p>the street descended into Mme. Caillaux's lap. Caillaux's

<p>he lifted his wife from the carriage with the other, and
</p>
<p>fought his way through the mob to a closed cab, which
</p>
<p>hurried off as fast as its little, snorting motor could propel
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>The next that Paris heard of Caillaux was a report,
</p>
<p>printed Oct. 30, that he was spending a fortnight in a
</p>
<p>fortress because of a speech he had made to troops in the
</p>
<p>trenches. The Duke de Rohan told the story in the Chamber
</p>
<p>of Deputies, as follows:
</p>
<p>"Caillaux this week went to Doulens, where he found re-
</p>
<p>servists and territorials belonging to his political consti-
</p>
<p>tuency. He said to them :
</p>
<p>" 'You seem to be undergoing tremendous hardships. If
</p>
<p>any of you would like to be transferred to a less dangerous
</p>
<p>position, you have only to tell me. The situation is exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly grave, for we are fighting the world alone. The
</p>
<p>British troops are of no assistance to us.' '
</p>
<p>Finding that he could not carry on his secret negotiations
</p>
<p>with Germany without going to some neutral country, Cail-
</p>
<p>laux hurried his plans for a trip to South America. Finally,
</p>
<p>on Nov. 14, 1914, Caillaux and his wife left Bordeaux on the
</p>
<p>steamship, Perou, bound for Puerto Cabella and La Guayra
</p>
<p>in Venezuela. There were all kinds of stories printed at the
</p>
<p>time to explain Caillaux's going. One was that he had gone
</p>
<p>into enforced exile. Another explained that he intended to
</p>
<p>go to Brazil for the purpose of obtaining Brazilian raw
</p>
<p>materials and foodstuffs for France, that formerly were im-
</p>
<p>ported from Germany and Austria. It was also reported
</p>
<p>that Caillaux would inquire into the proposed reorganiza-
</p>
<p>tion of the French South American cables and would attempt
</p>
<p>to replace the German lines operated by way of Teneriffe,
</p>
<p>Monrovia and Pernambuco.
</p>
<p>Beneath all this camouflage Caillaux redoubled his efforts
</p>
<p>to bring about his long prepared scheme of splitting the

<p>Entente by stirring up a hatred of England among the
</p>
<p>56 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>French people, concluding a separate peace between France
</p>
<p>and Germany, and bringing Italy and Spain into the war
</p>
<p>on the side of the Central Powers. At this time Italy was
</p>
<p>still neutral. She did not declare war against Austria until
</p>
<p>May 23, 1915, and against Germany until Aug. 28, 1915. In
</p>
<p>South America at this time the position of Germany was in
</p>
<p>urgent need of such a master of intrigue, as Caillaux. None
</p>
<p>of the countries of the New World except Canada had ever
</p>
<p>thought of entering the war, and Germany was making
</p>
<p>every effort to use these neutral nations to her own advan-
</p>
<p>tage.
</p>
<p>It had long been the hope of Berlin to create a great
</p>
<p>Latin league, hostile to England. Accordingly all kinds of
</p>
<p>German propaganda to inflame the Latin mind with jealousies
</p>
<p>and hatred of Great Britain and the Anglo Saxon were scat-
</p>
<p>tered throughout South and Central America. In Mexico these
</p>
<p>seeds of pestilence found a peculiarly fertile soil. Germany
</p>
<p>easily persuaded many Mexicans to believe that the United
</p>
<p>States had all the Anglo Saxon iniquities of England, and
</p>
<p>many more, and while Mexican bandits crossed the Rio
</p>
<p>Grande on missions of murder and rapine German agents
</p>
<p>in the United States tried to involve this country in a war
</p>
<p>with Mexico, which would prevent us from furnishing the
</p>
<p>Allies with arms and munitions.
</p>
<p>At this time the German Embassy in Washington became
</p>
<p>the great clearing house for all the German espionage and
</p>
<p>intrigue in the New World. Bernstorff, under the cloak of
</p>
<p>the Swedish diplomatic service and through other hidden
</p>
<p>channels, kept Berlin informed of the movements of ships, the
</p>
<p>employment and payment of German spies, the destruction
</p>
<p>by bombs and fires of munition plants and factories engaged
</p>
<p>in making war supplies, the many mysterious strikes
</p>
<p>and acts of sabotage all over the United States, which
</p>
<p>were all planned to cripple the cause of the Allies.

</p>
<p>When Caillaux reached the Argentine, he found a very
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 57
</p>
<p>active and powerful German influence, not only in trade cir-
</p>
<p>cles, but in politics. He found that it reached the very top
</p>
<p>of the government.
</p>
<p>In Buenos Ayres Caillaux got in touch with Count Lux-
</p>
<p>burg, German Minister to Argentina, who will always be
</p>
<p>remembered as having best revealed the German policy of
</p>
<p>brutality and dissimulation in his "sunk without a trace"
</p>
<p>cablegram.
</p>
<p>A policy much the same as this had long been followed by
</p>
<p>Caillaux. He had long tried to sink the French ship of
</p>
<p>State without leaving a trace of his perfidy. In Count
</p>
<p>Luxburg, therefore, he found a peculiarly congenial part-
</p>
<p>ner. The two of course were never seen together. They
</p>
<p>sought to work without leaving a trace of their joint enter-
</p>
<p>prise. Through go-betweens and in other ways Caillaux
</p>
<p>informed Luxburg of his ceaseless efforts to bring about a
</p>
<p>separate peace with France and the establishment of a great
</p>
<p>Latin combination, that would help Germany destroy Eng-
</p>
<p>land.
</p>
<p>One of those who carried messages back and forth between
</p>
<p>Luxburg and Caillaux was Count James Minotto, a German
</p>
<p>nobleman with an Italian name, a son-in-law of Louis F.
</p>
<p>Swift, the Chicago packer, who was living in Buenos Ayres
</p>
<p>at this time.
</p>
<p>Minotto was caught in the United States, after he had
</p>
<p>tried to obtain a place in the United States Naval Intelligence
</p>
<p>Service. After a period of internment in the prison near
</p>
<p>Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., he was brought to New York City and
</p>
<p>examined by the Attorney General of New York State who
</p>
<p>was acting for the French Government. Confronted by in-
</p>
<p>controvertible evidence, whcih had already been obtained
</p>
<p>from other sources, Minotto confessed. He said that his
</p>
<p>mother before her marriage was Agnes Sorna, a famous Ger-

</p>
<p>man actress. In New York City, he said, she had won
</p>
<p>58 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>special fame as the star of Hauptmann's "Sunken Bell,"
</p>
<p>produced in German at the old Irving Place Theatre.
</p>
<p>In Argentina, Minotto told everybody that he was employ-
</p>
<p>ed by a great New York banking institution. Under this cam-
</p>
<p>ouflage he got into communication with Luxburg, and during
</p>
<p>the time he was in the Argentine capital he was in confer-
</p>
<p>ence with Luxburg nearly every day. He was also in almost
</p>
<p>daily touch with Caillaux, and thus he came to know many
</p>
<p>of the details of the great plot to disrupt the Entente with
</p>
<p>a separate French peace and an anti British Latin alliance.
</p>
<p>In these details, Minotto said, Malvy figured constantly, as
</p>
<p>Caillaux's chief representative in France, who as a Cabinet
</p>
<p>Minister could keep Caillaux in touch with all the inner
</p>
<p>secrets of French governmental affairs.
</p>
<p>Investigations also revealed the fact that Minotto had been
</p>
<p>in touch with Count von Bernstorff, the German Ambassa-
</p>
<p>dor to the United States, through whom Luxburg sent many
</p>
<p>of his communications to Berlin.
</p>
<p>Before Caillaux returned to France, German raiders in the
</p>
<p>South Atlantic had been capturing and sinking the vessels
</p>
<p>not only of the belligerent nations, but also of neutrals. For
</p>
<p>example, the William P. Frye, an American bark, on January
</p>
<p>28, 1915, fell a prey to the German sea wolves. It was
</p>
<p>generally believed that the Teutons maintained secret bases
</p>
<p>on the South American coast where they received wireless
</p>
<p>instructions from Berlin for their voyages of piratical ad-
</p>
<p>venture.
</p>
<p>Ever fearing for his life, Caillaux besought even the pro-
</p>
<p>tection of the enemy. His appeal was granted, as shown in
</p>
<p>the following message, which Bernstorff received in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington by way of Havana, and on February 4, 1915, for-
</p>
<p>warded to Berlin:

</p>
<p>Another message, which also reveals the terror in Cail-

</p>
<p>the first cablegram. It read:
</p>
<p>"Buenos Ayres telegraphed the following:
</p>
<p>" 'Caillaux has left Buenos Ayres after a short stay, and
</p>
<p>is going direct to France, evidently on account of the

<p>(undecipherable) scandal, which he regards as a personal
</p>
<p>attack upon himself. He speaks contemptuously of the
</p>
<p>President and the rest of the French government, with the
</p>
<p>exception of Briand. He sees through the policy of England
</p>
<p>perfectly. He does not anticipate the complete overthrow
</p>
<p>of France. He sees in the war now a struggle for existence
</p>
<p>on the part of England.
</p>
<p>" 'Although he spoke much of the "indiscretions and
</p>
<p>clumsy policy" of Wilhelmstrasse and professed to believe in

<p>German atrocities, he has in essentials hardly changed his

<p>political orientation.

<p>" 'Caillaux welcomed indirect courtesies from me, but
</p>
<p>emphasized the extreme caution which he is obliged to show,
</p>
<p>as the French government, he said, had him watched even

<p>here.
</p>
<p>" 'He warns against the excessive praise bestowed upon

<p>Life
</p>
<p>The Germans were guilty of using poison gas for the first
</p>
<p>time in warfare, when on April 22, 1915, they poured a
</p>
<p>flood of deadly fumes upon the Canadians at Ypres, and
</p>
<p>then charged upon the heaps of writhing, dying men.
</p>
<p>Before this battle of Ypres, however, Germany began
</p>
<p>another campaign of poison, in which she tried by means of
</p>
<p>the most insidious propaganda to kill the very soul of
</p>
<p>France. As soon as her first, great drive against Paris
</p>
<p>failed, she revived her old time scheme of destroying France
</p>
<p>through treachery, of demoralizing the French with fears and
</p>
<p>doubts, of seeking to persuade them it was folly to war
</p>
<p>against the Teuton, of stirring up hatred against England,
</p>
<p>of urging a separate peace and a Franco-German alliance,
</p>
<p>as the only solution of the European problem.
</p>
<p>In pursuance of this plan Caillaux was negotiating with
</p>
<p>Luxburg in Buenos Ay res, and Malvy and Almereyda were
</p>
<p>cooperating with pacifists, defeatists and anarchists in Paris.
</p>
<p>By January, 1915, the great offensive of the enemies within
</p>
<p>the republic was well under way.

<p>Spies and German agents of all kinds smuggled themselves
</p>
<p>into France by way of Switzerland and Spain. Pamphlets

</p>
<p>their way into the trenches. Circulars and posters outlining
</p>
<p>a Bolshevik revolution were distributed among the workers
</p>
<p>of munition plants. Labor unions were incited to declare
</p>
<p>strikes, that would cripple transportation or the manufac-
</p>
<p>ture of war supplies.
</p>
<p>Almerejda became even more active and powerful in the
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior. He found it no longer necessary
</p>
<p>to consult Malvy every time he wanted a carload of prison-
</p>
<p>ers liberated, or tickets of sojourn issued to Germans, Aus-
</p>
<p>trians and Turks who wished to stay in Paris unmolested.
</p>
<p>The intricate machinery of obtaining cards of identifica-
</p>
<p>tion at the office of the Prefecture of the Police, the process
</p>
<p>of furnishing one's name, the names of parents, the place and
</p>
<p>date of birth, and answering a score of other questions, as
</p>
<p>to one's past history, was practically brushed aside, when it
</p>
<p>interfered with Almereyda's friends.
</p>
<p>Now and then the military police would force the arrest
</p>
<p>of suspects ; but while the prisoners were being put aboard
</p>
<p>trains to be carried from Paris to the internment camps,
</p>
<p>Almereyda would have Malvy, as head of the civil police, set
</p>
<p>the men free. Once, when Malvy 's subordinates were a little
</p>
<p>slow in carrying out his orders, Almereyda hurried to the
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior, and without the formality of send-
</p>
<p>ing in his name, walked into the inner office.
</p>
<p>"These arrests must stop," cried the Chief of the Apaches,
</p>
<p>tossing a paper containing a long list of names upon Malvy's
</p>
<p>desk. "These are all our men. We can never hold our own
</p>
<p>people together, and permit them to be treated in this
</p>
<p>fashion."
</p>
<p>Malvy looked up at the strangely luminous eyes of the
</p>
<p>visitor eyes in which a mind made almost mad by drugs
</p>
<p>burned with an uncanny lustre and then picked up the
</p>
<p>paper. The Apache chieftain seemed to read the Minister's
</p>
<p>mind.

<p>"Of course there will be a great hue and cry from the
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 63
</p>
<p>Conservatives, from men like Daudet, who will use the black
</p>
<p>ink of his L' Action Franfaise to paint you a traitor," said
</p>
<p>Almereyda. "But all that those fellows say will be dis-
</p>
<p>counted. They will not be believed, simply because they are
</p>
<p>your political enemies. The socialists never listen to them,
</p>
<p>even when they are telling the truth."
</p>
<p>Almereyda passed a cigarette case to the Minister, who
</p>
<p>merely glanced at the fortune of diamonds with which the
</p>
<p>monogram was set.
</p>
<p>The leader of the Corsican Guard did not need to repeat
</p>
<p>his request. Orders were given that his letter to the Prefect
</p>
<p>of Police be immediately obeyed. The letter read :
</p>
<p>"Enclosed is a list of some poor devils who have been
</p>
<p>arrested, and whom in accord with M. Malvy and M. Richard
</p>
<p>(director of the secret service bureau) I ask you to release.
</p>
<p>"If I thought that there might be any danger or even
</p>
<p>embarrassment for the country, I would not make this re-
</p>
<p>quest.
</p>
<p>"Thanks, kindest regards.
</p>
<p>"(Signed) Miguel Almereyda."
</p>
<p>The prisoners were at once set free.
</p>
<p>Another letter which was produced later in court and
</p>
<p>which showed Almereyda's ability to liberate prisoners with-
</p>
<p>out even a visit to the Minister's private office, was written to
</p>
<p>M. Leseyeux, an assistant of M. Paoli, Secretary General of
</p>
<p>the Prefecture of Police. It read:
</p>
<p>"Kindly give M. Paoli my thanks and express to him my
</p>
<p>gratitude for having liberated some poor devils, whom I
</p>
<p>recommended to you.
</p>
<p>"I am aware that you often make errors, but they are
</p>
<p>excusable. You would make me particularly happy, if you
</p>
<p>would communicate this letter also to M. Paoli and ask him
</p>
<p>for authorization to order the liberation of the entire car-
</p>
<p>load this evening, if possible."

<p>Then followed a list of ten men.
</p>
<p>64 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>From many of those whom he befriended with tickets of
</p>
<p>sojourn, stays of execution, orders of liberation, and other
</p>
<p>favors he was able to get from the Prefecture of Police
</p>
<p>and the Surete Generate, Almereyda obtained various "tokens
</p>
<p>of good will." In the case of M. Rabbat, for example, Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda received what Rabbat called a "loan" of 5,000 francs.
</p>
<p>For Rabbat Almereyda obtained the suspension of a decree
</p>
<p>of exile.
</p>
<p>And what manner of man was Rabbat, for whom Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda interceeded so successfully? The answer is to be
</p>
<p>found in the report of M. Peres, head of a commission which
</p>
<p>finally dug to the bottom of the intrigue, corruption and
</p>
<p>treason of Malvy's administration. I quote now from the
</p>
<p>Peres report:
</p>
<p>"Rabbat was an Ottoman subject. He lived in Paris for
</p>
<p>some years, and with the aid of funds of more than suspicious
</p>
<p>origin, founded a bank in which he co-operated with a certain
</p>
<p>Zucco, already condemned six times. It was a swindling
</p>
<p>enterprise.
</p>
<p>"Although he had been condemned on June 20, 1913,
</p>
<p>Rabbat still continued to live in Paris after his term in
</p>
<p>prison, and was still in Paris, when war was declared. As
</p>
<p>soon as Turkey entered the conflict, he asked a permit of
</p>
<p>sojourn, which was granted without any difficulty on Nov.
</p>
<p>26, 1914, despite his past record.
</p>
<p>"Rabbat was left at large. He became suspiciously active.
</p>
<p>Finally he ran up against the Surete Generate, (Malvy's
</p>
<p>Secret Service Bureau). It seems that his mistress, who had
</p>
<p>been arrested at Nancy for espionage, had turned informer
</p>
<p>against him. The Surete Generate and the Prefecture of
</p>
<p>Police accordingly investigated Rabbat, and reported that
</p>
<p>he was a criminal, who was suspected of having relations with
</p>
<p>the enemy. One report, dated March 31, 1915, read:
</p>
<p>" 'It is astonishing that in the face of facts so deplorable
</p>

</p>
<p>and a past record so regrettable, Rabbat was able to secure
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 65
</p>
<p>a permit of sojourn?' At the bottom of the report, the
</p>
<p>director of the Surete Generate made this notation.
</p>
<p>" 'I consider this man dangerous for many reasons. I
</p>
<p>believe he should be interned.' "
</p>
<p>At this stage Almereyda's power was invoked. Records
</p>
<p>showed that the order of expulsion, which had been issued
</p>
<p>for Rabbat on April 6, 1915, was stayed only a week later.
</p>
<p>Accompanying the stay came a letter of approval from Min-
</p>
<p>ister Malvy to the Prefect of Police.
</p>
<p>"Meantime Rabbat continued his swindling operations,"
</p>
<p>continues the Peres report. "The military police (which
</p>
<p>were always clashing with Malvy) pointed him out as a
</p>
<p>suspect, but he still was permitted to go free.
</p>
<p>"The part which Almereyda played behind the scenes was
</p>
<p>revealed by Rabbat himself, who said that he was not only
</p>
<p>indebted to Almereyda for the suspension of the order of
</p>
<p>expulsion, but also a safe conduct pass to enable him to go
</p>
<p>to Annemasso, whence he had easily crossed the line into
</p>
<p>Switzerland for the purpose of selling a package of Austrian
</p>
<p>bonds. Rabbat further added that he had loaned Almereyda
</p>
<p>5,000 francs for his services.
</p>
<p>"In Geneva Rabbat started an agency for concealing
</p>
<p>stolen goods and a sort of clearing house for bonds and
</p>
<p>securities, which the Germans had purloined from the in-
</p>
<p>vaded countries. It was with great difficulty that France
</p>
<p>obtained his extradition. He was brought back to Paris at
</p>
<p>last to answer for his crimes.
</p>
<p>"This episode should be considered as a monument to the
</p>
<p>influence and power of Almereyda."
</p>
<p>In permitting spies and other German agents to operate
</p>
<p>unmolested Malvy was continually conflicting with the milit-
</p>
<p>ary police, know as the Second Burean. The inspectors of
</p>
<p>the Second Burean were under the jurisdiction of the army,

<p>quent statements to the press, began attacking the Second
</p>
<p>Bureau, as "meddlesome, bungling, incompetent." Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda and Malvy insisted that it prevented the civil police
</p>
<p>from doing their duty. The fight became hotter and hotter.
</p>
<p>Finally, the Caillaux crowd succeeded, and the Second Bu-
</p>
<p>reau was suppressed.
</p>
<p>Among the many cases in which Malvy's civil police ran
</p>
<p>afoul of the Second Bureau was the Kovaczs affair.
</p>
<p>Mme. Kovaczs was an Austrian woman. She was sent to
</p>
<p>the concentration camp at Garaison, but returned to Paris
</p>
<p>and took an apartment at No. 60 Avenue du Bois-de-Bou-
</p>
<p>logne. On many occasions the neighbors noticed mysterious
</p>
<p>goings and comings of strangers, meetings at unusual hours
</p>
<p>of the night, and the conversations that were caught from
</p>
<p>her windows were always in German.
</p>
<p>Inspectors of the military police investigated. They
</p>
<p>learned from Malvy's prefect of Police, that Malvy, himself,
</p>
<p>had authorized the woman to return to Paris and obtained
</p>
<p>for her a monthly ticket of sojourn that she might remain in
</p>
<p>the French capital unmolested.
</p>
<p>The military police, nevertheless, continued their investi-
</p>
<p>gation. They discovered that the woman was keeping in
</p>
<p>constant touch with various Germans, whose activities were
</p>
<p>also extremely suspicious, and they accordingly demanded
</p>
<p>that the woman be sent back to the concentration camp. In-
</p>
<p>stead, the Prefecture of Police at the request of Malvy gave
</p>
<p>her an unlimited permit of sojourn.
</p>
<p>Even more persistently the Second Bureau shadowed the
</p>
<p>woman. It finally turned up facts, which convinced the Com-
</p>
<p>mission for the Revision of Permits to order the woman
</p>
<p>expelled. When the inspector went to Mme. Kovaczs's

<p>home to conduct her to the border, who should open the
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 67
</p>
<p>door of her apartment in answer to his knocking, but a
</p>
<p>French general.
</p>
<p>Many of the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians, who
</p>
<p>wanted permits of sojourn in Paris at the outbreak of the
</p>
<p>war possessed great wealth or represented enemy interests
</p>
<p>of vast financial power. It was not infrequently said in the
</p>
<p>Paris cafes, that 100,000 francs would be cheap for a ticket
</p>
<p>cf sojourn for not a few alien enemies, whose business inter-
</p>
<p>ests necessitated their staying in the French metropolis.
</p>
<p>Some of the political agents and spies in the employ of the
</p>
<p>German government would have paid any price for such
</p>
<p>permits.
</p>
<p>One of the German financiers, who fell under the suspicion
</p>
<p>of the Second Bureau, was M. Vercken. Born in Belgium,
</p>
<p>M. Vercken had become a naturalized French citizen. As M.
</p>
<p>Peres said in his report :
</p>
<p>"Under the complaisant mask of a French Council of
</p>
<p>Administration, M. Vercken had been throwing our mining
</p>
<p>concessions into the hands of German captains of industry
</p>
<p>before the war, and he was continuing in these activities.
</p>
<p>"The Second Bureau investigated his enterprises, which in
</p>
<p>time of war could be used to compromise our national pro-
</p>
<p>duction. After the suppression of the Second Bureau, the
</p>
<p>Central Bureau of Information, which succeeded it, did
</p>
<p>nothing."
</p>
<p>The Central Bureau of Information was made subservient
</p>
<p>to the Prefecture of Police, which was subservient to Malvy.
</p>
<p>Continuing M. Peres said :
</p>
<p>"Another example is the Victoria Bank. It has been
</p>
<p>maintaining in Paris, despite its assurances, a 'special bu-
</p>
<p>reau' of spies, having as the territory of its activities, the
</p>
<p>Eastern part of France. Von Mainen and Gymros, of the
</p>
<p>Victoria Bank, have been circulating throughout Paris un-

</p>
<p>other, a Belgian uniform. In a Belgian uniform also
</p>
<p>promenades M. Artmann, director of the bank, a so-called
</p>
<p>Roumanian, who was denounced by Georges Prade in his
</p>
<p>campaign in 'Le Journal' against the 'Foreigners of the
</p>
<p>Interior.' "
</p>
<p>Artmann was watched by the Second Bureau, but defended
</p>
<p>by Almereyda, who attested to his honesty with great vigor.
</p>
<p>Almereyda also met the attacks of Le Journal by defama-
</p>
<p>tions addressed to Commandant Baudier, head of the Second
</p>
<p>Bureau. Finally, Almereyda triumphed over both M. Prade
</p>
<p>and Commandant Baudier, thanks to the will of the Minister
</p>
<p>of the Interior, who gave M. Artmann a ticket of sojourn.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the campaign of Le Journal against the Boches
</p>
<p>of Paris. Thus also ended the Second Bureau.
</p>
<p>Commandant Baudier, however, did not abandon the Sec-
</p>
<p>ond Bureau without a fight. He insisted on a personal in-
</p>
<p>terview with the all powerful Malvy. Through the interven-
</p>
<p>tion of George Prade, M. Humbert, editor of Le Journal
</p>
<p>arranged for Baudier to see the Minister of the Interior.
</p>
<p>Baudier had hardly seated himself, before Malvy exclaimed:
</p>
<p>"I demand that you should be discharged from the Mili-
</p>
<p>tary Government of Paris, because the action of the Second
</p>
<p>Bureau has not been in accord with the attitude of the Min-
</p>
<p>istry of the Interior, the Prefecture of Police, and the
</p>
<p>Surete Generate.
</p>
<p>"I have also asked and obtained the discharge of General
</p>
<p>Maunoury, General Clergerie and Colonel Monteil, because
</p>
<p>in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate they were oppos-
</p>
<p>ing the action of the Ministry of the Interior and praising
</p>
<p>the Military Government."
</p>
<p>Almereyda's wealth was now piling up fast. Beside "gifts"
</p>
<p>and "loans" from "friends" he received through Malvy a re-
</p>
<p>gular subsidy for the Bonnet Rouge. The money was drawn

<p>from the funds of the Minister of the Interior in sums of

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 69
</p>
<p>2,000 to 8,000 francs and turned over each month to Almer-
</p>
<p>eyda's newspaper.
</p>
<p>From many other sources Almereyda also gathered
</p>
<p>princely tribute. He once boasted that by the end of the
</p>
<p>war he would be the richest man in Paris. But his friends
</p>
<p>shook their heads. They did not doubt that he was reaping
</p>
<p>a golden harvest, but they knew he was spending his riches
</p>
<p>even faster than they came.
</p>
<p>Almereyda paraded his wealth. He was of that super-
</p>
<p>ficial type of man, who, realizing the shallowness of his na-
</p>
<p>ture, seeks to cover it up with the pompous trappings of
</p>
<p>prosperity. He bought his clothes in the most expensive and
</p>
<p>most exclusive establishments. He traded his old automo-
</p>
<p>bile for one of the latest and most luxurious pattern, and in
</p>
<p>one corner of the deeply upholstered tonneau he joined the
</p>
<p>afternoon promenades of fashion along the beautifully
</p>
<p>wooded driveways of the Bois de Boulogne.
</p>
<p>Beside him he sometimes took Madame Q, a lady whom he
</p>
<p>had met at an all night revel at the home of the "Cocaine
</p>
<p>Queen" of Paris, and who had formerly been one of the most
</p>
<p>trusted agents of Germany at the French capital, until she
</p>
<p>became a hopeless victim of drugs.
</p>
<p>Almereyda's private life was the gossip of the boulevards.
</p>
<p>In one of the sworn statements of Leon Daudet, which was
</p>
<p>later embodied in a government report, Almereyda was pic-
</p>
<p>tured in two homes, in one of which lived Mme. Clero Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda, and in the other, Mile. Emilienne Brevannes.
</p>
<p>Despite all the rumors of the cafes, the two ladies seemed
</p>
<p>to be on the best of terms, for Daudet tells how they took a
</p>
<p>trip together to Verdun during the last days of 1915, when
</p>
<p>the Crown Prince of Germany was massing all his forces in a
</p>
<p>gigantic effort to capture the French citadel. Armed with
</p>
<p>the necessary permits, which the Caillaux editor had obtained
</p>
<p>through the influence of friends of high official rank, Mme.

<p>70 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>and entered the fortress. They carried with them a great
</p>
<p>quantity of pacifist and defeatist literature, which they dis-
</p>
<p>tributed among the troops.
</p>
<p>Almereyda was soon living at such a pace that one auto-
</p>
<p>mobile was not enough. One by one he bought more cars,
</p>
<p>until he maintained a fleet of six. Finally, he purchased a
</p>
<p>garage in the Boulevard Pereire, where he kept his own ma-
</p>
<p>chines and rented space for others. During one governmen-
</p>
<p>tal investigation from which he emerged successfully, he
</p>
<p>explained that the automobiles he drove belonged only to the
</p>
<p>garage, and that his money came from a wine merchant,
</p>
<p>named Boulet, in payment for his campaign in behalf of the
</p>
<p>wine business, and from M. Francfort who had given him
</p>
<p>50,000 francs for securing an important order from the
</p>
<p>Ministry of Munitions.
</p>
<p>One of Almereyda's chauffeurs was a Hollander, by the
</p>
<p>name of Edouard Klisser. From Klisser Daudet obtained
</p>
<p>information that the Almereyda automobiles were continually
</p>
<p>going through the French lines with packages of Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge editions for distribution among the soldiers. During
</p>
<p>1915, 1916 and 1917 Almereyda's motor cars sowed the
</p>
<p>seeds of defeatism along the battle line, and no one in or
</p>
<p>out of the army appeared powerful enough to stop them.
</p>
<p>Klisser also told of one occasion, when Malvy and Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda were riding together in an open automobile, which per-
</p>
<p>mitted him to hear their conversation. The two were dis-
</p>
<p>cussing an impending reorganization of the cabinet, when it
</p>
<p>was generally believed that Malvy would be compelled to
</p>
<p>quit the Ministry of the Interior for the Ministry of Col-
</p>
<p>onies. According to Klisser, Malvy said to Almereyda :
</p>
<p>"It is absolutely necessary that you go and talk with
</p>
<p>Briand. You, yourself, know how important it is that I
</p>
<p>remain in the Ministry of the Interior."
</p>
<p>Briand began his political career as a socialist of the

<p>extremely radical type. After he became Premier he was
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 71
</p>
<p>accused by many of the socialists of having abandoned them
</p>
<p>for capitalistic interests. At this time Almereyda was able
</p>
<p>to obtain the audience of such statesmen as Briand, because
</p>
<p>of the power and influence of his newspaper, and his popu-
</p>
<p>larity among various formidable labor and socialist organiza-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>Klisser said he was ordered to drive to the home of Briand,
</p>
<p>where Almereyda got out and went into the house. After
</p>
<p>about twenty minutes Almereyda returned to the automobile,
</p>
<p>and taking his seat beside Malvy said:
</p>
<p>"Well, my friend, I did it. You stay in the Ministry of
</p>
<p>the Interior."

</p>
<p>There used to be a deeply recessed, shadow haunted, hollow
</p>
<p>sounding doorway in a side street of Paris, which led into
</p>
<p>a place, known as "La Ruche" ("The Bee Hive"). Past this
</p>
<p>door many a girl dared not walk at night. Within lurked
</p>
<p>a man, whom the women called "The Red Bee." Fearful
</p>
<p>stories were told of his noctural adventures, and so it came
</p>
<p>to pass that mothers warned their daughters to flee at his
</p>
<p>approach.
</p>
<p>Most times during the day the rumbling noise of a print-
</p>
<p>ing press was heard within "La Ruche." Strange looking
</p>
<p>men, whose faces were frequently hid under down-turned hat
</p>
<p>brims, passed hurriedly in and out. Now and then a motor
</p>
<p>delivery wagon stopped in front of the gloomy door, and
</p>
<p>from the depths of "The Bee Hive" were brought forth great
</p>
<p>packages of red pamphlets, which were quickly loaded into
</p>
<p>the automobile and whisked away.
</p>
<p>"The Red Bee" was known to the Prefecture of Police as
</p>
<p>Seba^tien Faure, one of the most dangerous anarchists in
</p>
<p>France. His name, like that of Almereyda and the rest of
</p>
<p>the Corsican Guard, was inscribed in the Garnet B. Faure
</p>
<p>was a pamphleteer. His printing office swarmed with anarch-
</p>

</p>
<p>been cast into prison because of their plots to overthrow
</p>
<p>France. Most of them advocated the same views as the
</p>
<p>Bolsheviks of Russia. Faure was their leader.
</p>
<p>When complaints were made to the police that he had
</p>
<p>attacked little girls, Faure only laughed.
</p>
<p>"They do not dare touch me," he boasted. "Malvy is my
</p>
<p>friend. He not only protects me, but he gives me money to
</p>
<p>publish my pamphlets."
</p>
<p>And Faure told the truth. The police did not touch him.
</p>
<p>From Malvy he not only received the hand of welcome, when
</p>
<p>he went to the Ministry of the Interior, but a regular gov-
</p>
<p>ernment subsidy of 1,500 francs a month. In other words,
</p>
<p>Malvy had the government pay Faure to work for the de-
</p>
<p>struction of the government.
</p>
<p>This amazing situation was not fully revealed until years
</p>
<p>afterward, when the Sebastien Faure skeleton in the Malvy
</p>
<p>closet was dragged forth and cast into the flames.
</p>
<p>Malvy's friendship for Faure showed itself in many ways.
</p>
<p>For example, when the Prefect of Seine-et-Oise learned that
</p>
<p>the treasonable pamphlets of "The Bee Hive" were being
</p>
<p>distributed among soldiers, he ordered them seized and made
</p>
<p>a prompt report to the Council. In the Council there was a
</p>
<p>man of deliberative mind, by the name of M. Sembat, who
</p>
<p>persuaded his fellows, that it was better to reason with Faure
</p>
<p>than to throw him into jail. Accordingly, an appeal was
</p>
<p>made to Malvy, as Minister of the Interior and the titular
</p>
<p>head of all the police prefects, to persuade Faure of the
</p>
<p>evil of his ways.
</p>
<p>Instead of reprimanding Faure, Malvy not only exoner-
</p>
<p>ated him but promised to put him on the government pay-
</p>
<p>roll. He even handed Faure all the police reports concern-
</p>
<p>ing his various iniquities, and permitted the anarchist to
</p>
<p>burn them.
</p>
<p>This act in itself was enough to have sent Malvy to

<p>prison, had there been anyone strong enough in France at
</p>
<p>74 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>that time to have enforced the law. According to Article
</p>
<p>173 of the French Penal Code:
</p>
<p>"Any judge, administrator, public functionary or officer,
</p>
<p>who shall have destroyed or done away with any papers or
</p>
<p>documents of which he had been a custodian or which may
</p>
<p>have been remitted or communicated to him by reason of his
</p>
<p>functions, shall be punished by a term of hard labor."
</p>
<p>The interview between Malvy and Faure took place Jan-
</p>
<p>uary 26, 1915. Eight or ten days later, M. Moreau, a sub-
</p>
<p>ordinate of Malvy discovered two new "Bee Hive" pamphlets
</p>
<p>which he thought so dangerous that he immediately reported
</p>
<p>they should be seized. M. Moreau's recommendation was
</p>
<p>passed along by M. Richard, Director of the Secret Service
</p>
<p>Bureau, to Malvy, with the result that it received this nota-
</p>
<p>tion:
</p>
<p>"Communique to the Director. It is ordered not to seize."
</p>
<p>In "La Treve des Peuples," ("The Truce of the Peoples")
</p>
<p>issued June 14, 1915, Sebastien Faure urged the army to
</p>
<p>strike. He said that on August 1, 191.5, all the soldiers
</p>
<p>should lay down their arms and go back to their canton-
</p>
<p>ments. Six thousand copies of this circular were printed, and
</p>
<p>Malvy made not the slightest effort to stop them.
</p>
<p>Faure's gratitude toward Malvy is shown by his letter to
</p>
<p>his friend Mauricius, an anarchist lecturer, with whom he
</p>
<p>planned to found a defeatist paper, called "Ce qu' il faut
</p>
<p>dire," ("What one must say") which later exerted a far
</p>
<p>reaching influence throughout the army. Under date of
</p>
<p>February 24, 1915, Faure wrote:
</p>
<p>"My dear Mauricius :
</p>
<p>"My expectations have been realized. Without hesita-
</p>
<p>tion, without any formality, without any condition, the sub-
</p>

</p>
<p>shall be maintained until the termination of the war. Thus

<p>a free mind,"
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 75
</p>
<p>Speaking of the proposed "Ce qu' il faut dire" and its
</p>
<p>defeatist campaign, he added:
</p>
<p>"In the first place we must make a brusk attack. We must
</p>
<p>hit the minds of the people quick, quick, if we wish to con-
</p>
<p>quer our adversary, before it has time to stop us."
</p>
<p>Thanks to the subsidy "Ce qu' il faut dire" was finally
</p>
<p>launched with the motto : "The sacred union of the pacifists
</p>
<p>versus the chauvinists."
</p>
<p>Not content with merely printing pamphlets Faure took
</p>
<p>the stump against the war. In the offices of the "Syndicat
</p>
<p>des Terrassiers," on May 20, 1915, he lectured to 1,200
</p>
<p>people, and his text was "Down with the War." Yet Malvy
</p>
<p>continued the subsidy.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were many ugly stories told in the back
</p>
<p>rooms of "The Bee Hive" concerning the complaints of
</p>
<p>mothers against Faure, to which the police paid no heed.
</p>
<p>Finally, on September 28, 1916, a demand that Faure be im-
</p>
<p>prisoned for an attack on two girls was thought by the lower
</p>
<p>police officials to be too serious to be dropped. It was passed
</p>
<p>along to the Prefect of Paris, who made this annotation :
</p>
<p>"I presented to Sebastien Faure the observations made in
</p>
<p>the report, which because of the state of the testimony can-
</p>
<p>not give ground for prosecution."
</p>
<p>During the first year of the war Germany's publicity
</p>
<p>agents in France did not dare use the newspapers openly.
</p>
<p>Even the Bonnet Rouge masked its guns. It contented it-
</p>
<p>self with insidious intimations that England was not aiding
</p>
<p>France all she should, and that British selfishness was acquir-
</p>
<p>ing the rest of the world and letting France bleed.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the enemy used pamphlets, which were anony-
</p>
<p>mous, whenever necessary to hide their authorship. Most
</p>
<p>of them were issued from anarchist and pacifist printing
</p>
<p>presses in Paris and distributed by secret agents throughout

</p>
<p>One of the first manifestos to attract the attention of the
</p>
<p>army authorities, appeared on December 27, 1914, when
</p>
<p>Caillaux was still in South America negotiating with the
</p>
<p>enemy for a separate peace. It was first seen in the depart-
</p>
<p>ments of the southwest. It was entitled UHwmanite
</p>
<p>("Humanity"), and was printed in huge letters, which read:
</p>
<p>"Extend your hand to Germany, who has never nourished
</p>
<p>any hatred against the French.

<p>"Make your governing heads cease fostering and develop-
</p>
<p>ing the militaristic and imperialistic spirit."
</p>
<p>In January, 1915, about the time that the British sank the
</p>
<p>German battle cruiser, "Bliicher," in a great naval engage-
</p>
<p>ment in the North Sea, another pamphlet from the same
</p>
<p>source began to be seen. It was printed like a poster, and
</p>
<p>would suddenly burst upon the view of the passerby, pasted
</p>
<p>to a wall, or suspended in a frame from a lamp post. This is
</p>
<p>the way it read:
</p>
<p>"Open your eyes and revolt, O, you Frenchmen ! Do not
</p>
<p>believe any longer what your rulers tell you, when they speak
</p>
<p>of right with a large 'R' and of liberty with a big 'L'? The
</p>
<p>French offensive has been forever broken. France has but
</p>
<p>one chance of saving herself, and that is to lay down her
</p>
<p>arms in the name of the higher interests of humanity."
</p>
<p>The Minister of War was constantly finding his hands tied
</p>
<p>by Malvy. He learned for instance that on July 1, 1915, a
</p>
<p>special bulletin of the "Union of the Metals" was to appear,
</p>
<p>that would champion the Swiss pacifists. Sure enough, when
</p>
<p>the bulletin left the presses it contained an article prohibited
</p>
<p>in Switzerland. It appealed for a world movement in favor
</p>
<p>of peace. "The massacre of the peoples must cease," it said.
</p>
<p>The Minister of War communicated with his colleague of
</p>
<p>the Interior, who replied:

<p>"We must not touch the Union of the Metals, nor the place
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 77
</p>
<p>where the paper is printed. We must simply endeavor to do
</p>
<p>what we can on the outside to stop its circulation."
</p>
<p>The Prefect of Seine-et-Oise, who made the first complaint
</p>
<p>to Malvy about Faure, complained to Malvy's Secret Service
</p>
<p>Bureau in May, 1916, that at Villeneuve-St. Georges an
</p>
<p>anarchist printing plant was running at full blast. The
</p>
<p>prefect got no reply. Some of the pamphlets from this
</p>
<p>establishment fell into the hands of Premier Briand, and on
</p>
<p>Dec. 29, 1916, Briand asked Malvy why he did not stop it.
</p>
<p>An investigation followed. The prefect explained that he
</p>
<p>had asked for instructions and got none. After this explana-
</p>
<p>tion he got his instructions from Malvy immediately. They
</p>
<p>were, "Do nothing without referring the matter to us."
</p>
<p>The correspondence of soldiers opened by the censor dis-
</p>
<p>covered that this propaganda of discontent, dispair, and
</p>
<p>defeat had a most insidious influence upon the troops. Here
</p>
<p>is only one letter, made public years afterward in a trial for
</p>
<p>treason. It was written by a soldier to his sweetheart, and
</p>
<p>read as follows:
</p>
<p>"My dearest little Jeanne:
</p>
<p>"I received today at the same time your two letters of
</p>
<p>December 30 and January 2. In the one of December 30,
</p>
<p>I found the manifesto in favor of peace and the little white
</p>
<p>sheet, which I read aloud to several dozen fellow soldiers in
</p>
<p>my squadron. Afterward, I communicated it to nearly all
</p>
<p>the regiment.
</p>
<p>"I put in it all my ardor, all my profound faith, all the
</p>
<p>intonation to be desired. Everybody approved it. I was
</p>
<p>sure of their sympathy, but when I asked them to sign their
</p>
<p>names, all, or nearly all said :
</p>
<p>" 'Yes, it is quite true, but it is impossible.'
</p>
<p>"Understand that I did not expert them to act any other
</p>
<p>way, but I took advantage of it to let them know what I
</p>
<p>thought of them. I abused them to my heart's content.

<p>"A few of them, however, wished to frame a vigorous reso-

<p>78 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>lution and told us that we should wire our approval and con-
</p>
<p>fidence to Sebastien Faure. I was compelled to check their
</p>
<p>ardor, because, if it is all right to show one's approval, it is
</p>
<p>useless to expose oneself to arrest and imprisonment."
</p>
<p>M. Merillon, the public prosecutor at the trial, at which
</p>
<p>the letter was put in evidence, said that this kind of poison
</p>
<p>was being poured into the very heart of France.
</p>
<p>"The existence of such propaganda is affirmed," he con-
</p>
<p>tinued. "I have also the reports of nearly all the command-
</p>
<p>ing generals, as for instance, Generals de Castelnau,
</p>
<p>Duchesne, Humbert, Franchet d' Esperey, St. Juste, Bon-
</p>
<p>clair and Guillaumlat, whom we are so happy to see in the de-
</p>
<p>fense of Paris. And this is what these chiefs have been able to
</p>
<p>prove.
</p>
<p>"In Paris there is a pestilential center, a revolutionary
</p>
<p>clearing house, whose branches reach far out into our armies.
</p>
<p>Its agents belong to an occult organization, and take their
</p>
<p>orders from Paris. There are also pamphlets of a purely
</p>
<p>German organization, with headquarters also in Paris. These
</p>
<p>are all part of a campaign instigated by the Germans for
</p>
<p>the purpose of delivering France to the enemy.
</p>
<p>"A letter from Gen. Nivelle to the Minister of War speaks
</p>
<p>of this iniquitous propaganda, as follows:
</p>
<p>" 'I have brought to the attention of the Minister of the
</p>
<p>Interior the attempts of the pacifists. Knowing that, unless
</p>
<p>I acted, the moral of the troops would be seriously affected,
</p>
<p>I deemed it necessary that strong measures should be taken.
</p>
<p>" 'I would be very much obliged to you, if you would inter-
</p>
<p>cede with M. Malvy in order to decide on the steps to be
</p>
<p>taken to stop these practices immediately.
</p>
<p>" 'The activity and scope of the pacifist propaganda in the
</p>
<p>army are constantly increasing. For a year, pacifist pamph-
</p>
<p>lets and papers have been reaching the troops. At the pres-
</p>
<p>ent time there is a veritable epidemic. These pamphlets

</p>

</p>
<p>mittee of Defense," "The Federation of Metals," "The
</p>

</p>
<p>Faure.'
</p>
<p>"All these sources have been well known to M. Malvy, be-
</p>
<p>cause they were all revealed to him.
</p>
<p>"They deny the just cause for which our soldiers are
</p>
<p>fighting. They defend Germany. They claim that it is
</p>
<p>impossible to defeat Germany, and pretend that peace alone
</p>
<p>will solve all the problems of the present hour.
</p>
<p>"Such propaganda weakens the offensive spirit of our
</p>
<p>troops. It enervates and discourages them.
</p>
<p>"The opinion of the General in Chief is that the most dras-
</p>
<p>tic measures be adopted. He urges that the pamphlets
</p>
<p>should be seized in the printing plants, where they are pub-
</p>
<p>lished; that the police should prohibit meetings or discus-
</p>
<p>sions of a pacifist and treasonable character ; that the revolu-

<p>tionary journal, 'Niochavo,' be suppressed, that the activi-
</p>
<p>ties of Sebastien Faure and like agitators should be stopped,
</p>
<p>and that a normal schedule of work be required in the
</p>
<p>arsenals and war plants.
</p>
<p>"After General Nivelle comes General Petain, who makes a
</p>
<p>similar appeal and demonstrates the necessity of taking im-
</p>
<p>mediate action. He concludes his recommendations by saying :
</p>
<p>" 'As for my part in this matter, I shall order the arrests
</p>
<p>of the agitators in the cantonments and suppress disorder
</p>
<p>and drunkenness as much as possible.'

</p>
<p>sequence of secret meetings, infantry regiments have de-
</p>
<p>cided to march on Paris. Precautions have been taken.

<p>conclusion :
</p>
<p>80 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"Germany did not only try to crush the > orld by force of
</p>
<p>arms. She tried also to dominate it through espionage, cor-
</p>
<p>ruption and treason. The proofs of her attempts in France
</p>
<p>and among our allies have been absolutely established.
</p>
<p>"The German propaganda in our territory dates away
</p>
<p>prior to the war. Interrupted for a moment, it resumed its
</p>
<p>work, at first in the shade, later with ever increasing boldness
</p>
<p>in our factories, our ports, our regiments. It was resumed
</p>
<p>during the late months of 1914. Soon after their defeat
</p>
<p>upon the Marne and the Yser, the Germans realized in their
</p>
<p>trenches that the war would be a long one and that the
</p>
<p>Franco-British alliance, unless disrupted, would dictate the
</p>
<p>terms of peace."
</p>
<p>Despite the protestations of army officials, the denuncia-
</p>
<p>tions of editors, like Daudet, of deputies, like Barres, and
</p>
<p>the constantly increasing fire of censure from the guns of
</p>
<p>Clemenceau's "L 9 Homme Libre" ("The Free Man"), Malvy
</p>
<p>treated all criticism with contempt. So great was his power
</p>
<p>and the power of his friends to thwart Clemenceau's cam-
</p>
<p>paign against official corruption, favoritism and criminal
</p>
<p>negligence, that for a time the "Tiger's" paper was sup-
</p>
<p>pressed. But the "Tiger" himself could not be caged. He

<p>MME. THERESE, ENEMY AGENT, VISITS CAILLAUX
</p>
<p>Asks Him to Meet Lipscher and Discuss Peace Terms
</p>
<p>CaUlaux Afraid Mme. Therese Also Meets a Soldier and
</p>
<p>Tells the Whole Story Malvy's Police Run Afoul of the
</p>
<p>Scandal and Hush It Up
</p>
<p>Almereyda was sitting in his office of the Bonnet Rouge
</p>
<p>one December afternoon in 1915, when the telephone rang,
</p>
<p>and a woman's voice said:
</p>
<p>"Caron would not take the black cross yet. Will call you
</p>
<p>again tomorrow."
</p>
<p>The Apache editor made no reply. He hung up the
</p>
<p>receiver and looked toward the desk, where Jean used to
</p>
<p>work before he went to war.
</p>
<p>"That was Therese," he said to himself. Caillaux would
</p>
<p>not take the responsibility of promulgating Germany's
</p>
<p>separate peace terms now. I ought to assign a reporter to
</p>
<p>watch her. She is always meeting somebody, and becoming
</p>
<p>too companionable. If Berlin knew all the things she did in
</p>
<p>Paris, she would never be trusted with any more important
</p>
<p>missions. But I've no man to shadow her. Jean would
</p>
<p>have been just the one for such work. I had perfect faith in
</p>
<p>him. Whom can I get?"
</p>
<p>Almereyda turned again to his desk, but Mme. Therese
</p>
<p>haunted his thoughts so persistently, that he found he could
</p>
<p>not write his editorial against British aggression in Africa.
</p>
<p>He became so upset, that finally he wheeled around in his
</p>
<p>chair, turned his back toward the door, pulled out of his

</p>
<p>pocket a dainty gold box, which looked as if it belonged to
</p>
<p>some lady's chatelaine, and from it poured upon a thumbnail
</p>
<p>a portion of cocaine. He did not notice that it was twice
</p>
<p>his usual dose, until he had snuffed it into his nostrils, and
</p>
<p>tilted himself back against the wall.
</p>
<p>He soon fell into a stupor.
</p>
<p>Had Almereyda not lost his senses at that particular time,
</p>
<p>France might never have known how Germany sent a woman
</p>
<p>to Caillaux in his Paris home, and asked him to go to Switzer-
</p>
<p>land to negotiate the terms of a separate peace.
</p>
<p>Just as Almereyda feared, Therese found a friend with
</p>
<p>whom she talked too much. The police got hold of the
</p>
<p>story. They learned that the woman had gone to Caillaux's
</p>
<p>house, and delivered Germany's message to him, that she had
</p>
<p>written and received letters from her partner, Lipscher, an
</p>
<p>agent of the Central Powers, stationed in Switzerland, and
</p>
<p>that in these letters Caillaux was always referred to as
</p>
<p>"Caron." In these letters, the police also learned, there
</p>
<p>was a peculiar jargon, which was thought to reveal the
</p>
<p>existence of a secret order, devoted to the overthrow of
</p>
<p>France and the establishment of a Bolshevik state, and that
</p>
<p>its emblem was a black cross.
</p>
<p>Because these revelations implicated Caillaux, Malvy had
</p>
<p>them smothered. The Duverger woman was allowed to es-
</p>
<p>cape. All the papers in the case were pigeonholed. Not
</p>
<p>until the Clemenceau premiership was bold enough to put
</p>
<p>Malvy on trial and dig out of Malvy's own files the proof of
</p>
<p>his criminal negligence, were the secret machinations of
</p>
<p>Caillaux, Lipscher, and Mme. Therese made public.
</p>
<p>The story is best told by translating the official report
</p>
<p>of this affair made by M. Peres to the French Senate. M.
</p>
<p>Peres used only the sworn testimony of witnesses and the
</p>
<p>official records of military and civil authorities. The tragic

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 88
</p>
<p>the Great Conspiracy, which it also uncovered, will be told
</p>
<p>in Chapter XX.
</p>
<p>The part of the report containing "The Lipscher Affair"
</p>
<p>reads as follows :
</p>
<p>"During the first days of October, 1915, the Surete Gen-
</p>
<p>erale (Secret Service Bureau of the Minstry of the Interior)
</p>
<p>by the various branches of information in Holland, was
</p>
<p>advised of the departure for France of a woman, called
</p>
<p>Therese Duverger, mistress of M. Lipscher, a Hungarian.
</p>
<p>"M. Lipscher was already well known in Paris, as an
</p>
<p>agent of international character. His name dates back to
</p>
<p>the trial of Mme. Caillaux, in which he was called to testify.
</p>
<p>It is he, who had negotiated with M. Calmette, in the name
</p>
<p>of Count Tisza, a contract for the publication in l Le Figaro*
</p>
<p>of a series of articles favorable to the Hungarian govern-
</p>
<p>ment. M. Caillaux had purchased from Lipscher a photo-
</p>
<p>graph of this agreement to use it as a weapon against the
</p>
<p>victim of his wife.
</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the war Lipscher wa(s at Brussels
</p>
<p>with the Duverger woman. After the occupation of Brus-
</p>
<p>sels by the Germans, he obtained from the German Com-
</p>
<p>mander a safe conduct to go to the Hague. His numerous
</p>
<p>letters, his frequent visits to various cities, his journeys
</p>
<p>abroad, and certain remarks which he was heard to make
</p>
<p>to his entourage in The Hague during several months stay
</p>
<p>there, caused the agents of the French secret service to point
</p>
<p>him out as a suspicious individual.
</p>
<p>"On October 11, 1915, the Duverger woman disembarked
</p>
<p>at Dieppe. She said she was going to her family at Arcueil-
</p>
<p>Cachant. She was watched, and it was reported that she
</p>
<p>arrived at Arcueil-Cachant. The Prefecture of Police was
</p>
<p>asked to shadow her movements.
</p>
<p>"On November 16, 1915, the Surete Generate, (Malvy's
</p>
<p>Secret Service Bureau) again called the attention of the

<p>Prefect of Police to watch the woman. This action resulted
</p>
<p>84 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>from a telegram received from the Minister of France at The
</p>
<p>Hague by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Paris, in-
</p>
<p>structing that special measures be taken to intercept her
</p>
<p>correspondence.
</p>
<p>"M. Gauthier, Commissaire of Police in charge of watch-
</p>
<p>ing the retrenched camp of Paris, under the direction of the
</p>
<p>military authorities, sent an official order to the Post Office
</p>
<p>of Arcueil-Cachant, stating that ah 1 the mail which the woman
</p>
<p>received or posted should be copied for a special report.
</p>
<p>(M. Gauthier was connected with the military police, over
</p>
<p>which Malvy had no jurisdiction. He was a member of
</p>
<p>what was known as the Second Bureau.)
</p>
<p>"A letter soon arrived from Lipscher, dated December 13.
</p>
<p>It came from Zurich, Switzerland.
</p>
<p>"First of all Lipscher apologized for not having written
</p>
<p>more often and at greater length, and added in a peculiar
</p>
<p>jargon, unintelligible to the uninitiated;
</p>
<p>" 'And then I looked for your letter today from Friday
</p>
<p>of that famous visit before putting my affair on the road of
</p>
<p>realization, but that letter has not arrived ye\.. Today I am
</p>
<p>wondering what sort of a yarn has offered again '
</p>
<p>"Simultaneously M. Gauthier seized two letteers in which
</p>
<p>an automobilist soldier, named Beauquier, who at that time
</p>
<p>was on leave in Paris, was asking the Duverger woman to
</p>
<p>come and have a talk with him. A watch was set, and sure
</p>
<p>enough, on December 18, 1915, at 3 p. m. in the parlor of the
</p>
<p>Hotel Terminus, which was designated as the rendezvous,
</p>
<p>Beauquier was found in a tete a tete with Mme. Therese.
</p>
<p>"After the interview Beauquier discovered that he was
</p>
<p>being shadowed. Of his own accord Beauquier went to the
</p>
<p>inspector and said:
</p>
<p>" 'I do not want to be compromised by this woman. I
</p>
<p>made an appointment with her to obtain some news about
</p>
<p>my wife, whom I left in Brussels. This Mme. Therese is a

</p>
<p>who desires to make overtures of peace to M. Caillaux. Lip-
</p>
<p>scher and Mme. Therese have been writing letters to each
</p>
<p>other about Caillaux and in this correspondence they always
</p>
<p>refer to him, as 'Caron.'
</p>
<p>"Bauquier informed the inspectors that he was willing to
</p>
<p>tell all he knew, if he were to be examined as a witness in any
</p>
<p>official proceeding.
</p>
<p>"On the morning of December 21, 1915, Commissaire
</p>
<p>Gauthier gave a verbal account of these facts to his chief,
</p>
<p>M. Mouton and at the same time he requested authorization
</p>
<p>to obtain the complete declaration, which Beauquier was
</p>
<p>ready to make.
</p>
<p>"This should have been done at once," said M. Peres, in
</p>
<p>commenting upon the situation, "because the soldier's leave
</p>
<p>Was to expire the following day.
</p>
<p>"But, M. Mouton did not see fit to comply immediately
</p>
<p>with the commissaire's request. Quite impressed, as he ex-
</p>
<p>plained later, by the gravity of the affair, he asked Commis-
</p>
<p>saire Gauthier to write without further investigation a report
</p>
<p>containing what facts he already had, and to bring it to him
</p>
<p>at the Cafe de Paris, where he was to have dejeuner with his
</p>
<p>friends, M. Richard and M. Maunoury.
</p>
<p>(M. Richard was the Director of the Surete Generate. M.
</p>
<p>Maunoury was Director of the Prefecture of Police of
</p>
<p>Paris. Both officees were under the Ministry of the Interior.
</p>
<p>Both men were subservient subordinates of Malvy.)
</p>
<p>"M. Gauthier did as he was told. He made out a report
</p>
<p>and took it to M. Mouton at the Cafe de Paris.

<p>"According to sworn statements of M. Richard and M.

<p>to give him all the papers in the case. In spite of Gauthier's
</p>
<p>protests M. Mouton told him to drop the whole matter."
</p>
<p>In a deposition to a Commissaire of the Sixth Army, Jan.
</p>
<p>30, 1916, Beauquier again revealed the most accurate in-
</p>
<p>formation concerning Lipscher and his relations with M.
</p>
<p>Caillaux. Beauquier's sincerity is undisputed. Most of
</p>
<p>the facts were easily verified.
</p>
<p>The statement of Beauquier, which follows, is a translation
</p>
<p>of sworn testimony:
</p>
<p>"At the time of mobilization," he said, "I found myself in
</p>
<p>Belgium, where I had a rubber factory. I did not leave
</p>
<p>Belgium until August 20, the day the Germans entered
</p>
<p>Brussels. I arrived in France August 27 or August 28. I
</p>
<p>lived in Paris. On February 6, I was declared fit for army
</p>
<p>service and on that same day I was incorporated in the
</p>
<p>171st regiment of infantry.
</p>
<p>"At that time, not having received any news of my wife
</p>
<p>and children in Brussels, I thought I would write to a woman
</p>
<p>friend of Lipscher, who had remained with him in Brussels,
</p>
<p>asking her to be good enough to tell me about my family, for
</p>
<p>I had known her very well. I did not receive any reply to my
</p>
<p>letter. The reason, as I learned later, was that she was no
</p>
<p>longer in Belgium. Then in July or August, 1915, I got a
</p>
<p>letter from Lipscher, mailed from Zurich, Switzerland.
</p>
<p>" 'I give you,' he wrote me, 'the address of my friend.
</p>
<p>She is now in France, at Arcueil-Cachan, with her par-
</p>
<p>ents.'
</p>
<p>"I wrote Mme. Duverger at the home of her family, and
</p>
<p>she replied almost immediately. She wrote:
</p>
<p>" 'I saw Mme. Beauquier during the last days preceeding
</p>
<p>my departure. I am at your disposal to give you all the
</p>
<p>information I can, and I would be very happy to be able to

</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 87
</p>
<p>"I made an appointment for the end of December, in the
</p>
<p>salon of the Hotel Terminus.
</p>
<p>"I met her there, and we talked for a while. At the last
</p>
<p>minute, I said to her, (for I had known Lipscher for a long
</p>
<p>time) :
</p>
<p>" 'And your bird, Lipscher, how is he?' '
</p>
<p>"Those were exactly the words I used. She answered:
</p>
<p>" 'You ought to know that he is still in Switzerland.' "
</p>
<p>" 'No,' I said, 'I only know I received a furious letter
</p>
<p>from him. . . .'
</p>
<p>"My impression was that the woman had been a very weak
</p>
<p>instrument in the hands of a very violent man, who had used
</p>
<p>her, not as a spy, no, I do not think that, but as his inter-
</p>
<p>mediary in reaching a certain political personage, to whom
</p>
<p>he was submitting certain propositions. Mme Duverger said
</p>
<p>to me:
</p>
<p>" 'I correspond with him constantly.'
</p>
<p>" 'How do you do it ?' I asked. 'The correspondence must
</p>
<p>be suspected.'
</p>
<p>" 'Oh, our correspondence,' she replied, 'is written in a
</p>
<p>certain, peculiar way. I cannot be more precise.
</p>
<p>" 'We employ for 'our correspondence the name "Caron"
</p>
<p>for M. Caillaux. We do that for fear that the correspond-
</p>
<p>ence might be seized. Why, do you know, day before yes-
</p>
<p>terday I was at his house.'
</p>
<p>" 'The house of M. Caillaux?' I asked in astonishment.
</p>
<p>" 'Yes,' she replied. 'It was my third visit. My first
</p>
<p>visit there was on the moment of my arrival in France. It
</p>
<p>was necessary at that time to give M. Caillaux certain Ger-
</p>
<p>mans plans for a separate peace, which were to be trans-
</p>
<p>mitted to him through the channel of Lipscher. The con-
</p>
<p>ditions for a separate peace were in substance as follows:
</p>
<p>" ' "The part of Alsace-Lorraine, occupied by the French
</p>
<p>shall remain the property of France. The other part shall

</p>
<p>out indemnity, and you shall give us a free hand with Eng-
</p>
<p>land.'"
</p>
<p>" 'The German Commander at Brussels had given this
</p>
<p>plan to Lipscher with a pass for him and myself to go to
</p>
<p>Switzerland.
</p>
<p>*' 'M. Caillaux refused to regard this proposition as being
</p>
<p>acceptable. We returned to Belgium.'
</p>
<p>"Some months passed," continued Beauquier in telling of
</p>
<p>the further movements of Lipscher and his companion, ."and
</p>
<p>then they gave Lipscher a pass for his mistress, and she de-
</p>
<p>parted to Holland to go from there to England, that she
</p>
<p>might re-enter France. They demanded of Lipscher that he
</p>
<p>go back again to Switzerland, to Zurich, in order that he
</p>
<p>might receive there new peace plans, which he would trans-
</p>
<p>mit to her. For that purpose, after all arrangements had
</p>
<p>been made, he wrote Mme. Duverger to arrange an interview
</p>
<p>for him with M. Caillaux.
</p>
<p>" 'When I saw M. Caillaux,' said Mme. Therese, 'I indi-
</p>
<p>cated to him that it was the desire of M. Lipscher to meet him
</p>
<p>to discuss peace plans. M. Caillaux answered me thus:
</p>
<p>" 'I shall not go to Switzerland, because I am watched. If
</p>
<p>I went there, I would certainly be assassinated.' Then he
</p>
<p>added, 'Wait, it is too early, now.'
</p>
<p>"After some more words, I accompanied Mme. Therese to
</p>
<p>the Lafayette Galleries (a great department store not far
</p>
<p>from the Hotel Terminus).
</p>
<p>"I felt that Mme. Duverger would be watched, and that
</p>
<p>everybody who had any dealings with her would also be put
</p>
<p>under surveillance. So, the next morning on leaving my
</p>
<p>hotel I suddenly retraced my steps. I perceived that I was
</p>
<p>being followed. I was stunned. Although innocent, I knew
</p>
<p>that I was compromised in something, which was not proper.
</p>
<p>I stopped opposite the St. Lazare station.
</p>
<p>"At that juncture, I said to myself that it was much

</p>
<p>simpler to face the music. I approached one of the inspect-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 89
</p>
<p>ors and told him that he had been following me sinct the
</p>
<p>night before, and added:
</p>
<p>" 'Here is my name and address. I have met a person who
</p>
<p>seems to have compromised me, but it was concerning a
</p>
<p>wholly proper matter. I wanted to learn some news of my
</p>
<p>wife and my property in Belgium. I am ready to make a
</p>
<p>statement before any one of you. In half an hour I expect
</p>
<p>to meet some friends at the Cardinal.' Finally, they let me
</p>
<p>go with the understanding that I would give my statement
</p>
<p>later.
</p>
<p>"The next morning an inspector of the police, M. Sur-
</p>
<p>zure, came to see me. He demanded that I put in writing
</p>
<p>what I knew of the relations between Mme. Duverger, M.
</p>
<p>Caillaux and M. Lipscher. I replied:
</p>
<p>" *I have never corresponded with him, but with his mis-
</p>
<p>tress, to whom I have written in Belgium. It is Lipscher
</p>
<p>who replied to me, because it was he who received the letter,
</p>
<p>which bears on its back the address of Lipscher in Zurich.'
</p>
<p>"I repeated then what Mme. Duverger had told me. M.
</p>
<p>Surzure answered:
</p>
<p>" 'This is very important. I am going to make a report
</p>
<p>to my chiefs. I will ask, if you please, that you meet me at
</p>
<p>six o'clock this evening at the Place de Clichy. I will in-
</p>
<p>troduce you to M. Gauthier, who is a Commissaire of the re-

<p>trenched camp of Paris. At six o'clock I was introduced to
</p>
<p>M. Gauthier, to whom I again repeated in detail the story
</p>
<p>that I had told to M. Surzure.
</p>
<p>"About two months afterward, when I was back in the

<p>army, I received a visit from a commissionaire of police con-
</p>
<p>nected with the Surete Generale, who questioned me for the
</p>
<p>first time under a commission of the secret service bureau.

</p>
<p>Then, about six months ago I was brought to Paris to testify
</p>
<p>90 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>before M. Priolet, and again before Captain Bouchardon."
</p>
<p>(Captain Bouchardon was the investigator, who dug up
</p>
<p>most of the evidence, which sent many of the plotters in the
</p>
<p>Great Conspiracy to death or imprisonment.)
</p>
<p>"I have known Lipscher some fifteen yearjs in Palris.
</p>
<p>During the first of those years he was interested in business
</p>
<p>connected with the Paris Stock Exchange. Later, three or
</p>
<p>four years before the war, I met him in Brussels and learned
</p>
<p>that his activities had become political. He also had some
</p>
<p>connection with the Paris newspaper, Le Journal, from which
</p>
<p>he had obtained a card, as correspondent photographer for
</p>
<p>Hungary. With this card he went to see M. Calmette at
</p>
<p>the Figaro office, and obtained from him at a late hour one
</p>
<p>evening, when no editor or other employe was there, a con-
</p>
<p>tract, by which the Figaro agreed to print certain political
</p>
<p>articles for the account of the Hungarian government.
</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact the Hungarian government did not
</p>
<p>know anything about the affair, but Lipscher was a cos-
</p>
<p>mopolitan courtier, making money out of everything. With
</p>
<p>the contract, M. Lipscher departed for Hungary, where he
</p>
<p>proceeded by taking things in their inverse order. He de-
</p>
<p>clared that some French journals could be persuaded to print
</p>
<p>articles favorable to the Hungarian government, and he
</p>
<p>asked to be its press agent for France. The trick was easy.
</p>
<p>He was at once made the government foreign correspondent
</p>
<p>.(that is his official title) at a salary of 17,000 kroners a
</p>
<p>year.
</p>
<p>"But Lipscher had two irons in the fire.
</p>
<p>"The first one was to make money on his contract of
</p>
<p>publicity, which amounted to 60,000 francs and of which he
</p>
<p>had reserved for himself 20 per cent, on all articles printed.
</p>
<p>"Lipscher's second object was more subtle. He had met
</p>
<p>in Belgum a M. Spier j, who had established a gambling house
</p>
<p>at Buda Pest, but on the fall of Count Tisza had lost the

</p>
<p>concession. The new minister had expelled Spier j. When
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 91
</p>
<p>Lipschcr met Spier j, plans were afoot for his return to
</p>
<p>Hungary, and the re-establishment of his gambling house.
</p>
<p>All of which necessitated the cancellation of the decree of
</p>
<p>expulsion.
</p>
<p>"This was accomplished by Lipscher, thanks to his title
</p>
<p>of official correspondent of the Hungarian government. In
</p>
<p>England he introduced Spierj to the Daily Graphic, so as to
</p>
<p>make him also a correspondent for the Hungarian govern-
</p>
<p>ment. The Daily Graphic accepted. Spier j's case was
</p>
<p>placed before the Austro-Hungarian ambassador, and as a
</p>
<p>result Spierj was reinstated and returned to Buda Pest.
</p>
<p>"Some time later Lipscher turned completely and espoused
</p>
<p>the cause of the Hungarian opposition. Obliged to quit
</p>
<p>Hungary he went to Brussels.
</p>
<p>"I kept track of all of Lipscher's doings, because I
</p>
<p>thought he was a very interesting creature from a psycho-
</p>
<p>logical point of view. He often consulted me. He knew I
</p>
<p>had studied law.
</p>
<p>"In the first quarter of 1914, the Hungarian opposition
</p>
<p>tried to reach M. Caillaux. At about the same time Lipscher
</p>
<p>facilitated an interview between Count Karolyi and M. Cail-
</p>
<p>laux. Two Hungarian deputies were also present. The in-
</p>
<p>terview took place in Paris. Other interviews followed, at
</p>
<p>one of which Lipscher sold Caillaux the paper, which accord-
</p>
<p>ing to Lipscher proved that Calmette had signed a contract
</p>
<p>to espouse the cause of the Hungarian government without
</p>
<p>it being known to the other officers of the Figaro.
</p>
<p>"One day before the trial of Mme. Caillaux, when Lip-
</p>
<p>scher was in Brussels, he said to me:
</p>
<p>" 'I have just seen Caillaux in Paris. We are convinced
</p>
<p>that Mme. Caillaux will be acquitted.'
</p>
<p>"Lipscher added that he hoped that such an event would
</p>
<p>make him a French citizen and assure him of a position in

</p>
<p>Caillaux of 15,000 francs. I congratulated him, and he
</p>
<p>answered :
</p>
<p>" 'That is what is called politics.' "
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that they had discovered a German agent
</p>
<p>in the heart of Paris, presenting a plan of treason to a for-
</p>
<p>mer Premier, Malvy's Prefecture of Police and his Surete
</p>
<p>Generate, with all their host of directors, secretaries, under
</p>
<p>secretaries, inspectors and other bureaucratic job holders,
</p>
<p>did nothing. The Duverger woman was allowed to escape.
</p>
<p>The soldier, who offered all his services in trying to uncover
</p>
<p>the plot, was ignored.
</p>
<p>The Peres report also revealed the fact that M. Maunoury,
</p>
<p>Director of the Prefecture of Police, even went so far as to
</p>
<p>inform Caillaux personally of the alleged treason in which
</p>
<p>Beauquier's story had involved him. Regarding the final
</p>
<p>.efforts of the police to hush up the scandal, the Peres report
</p>
<p>"A letter was written on March 2, 1916, by the Prefec-
</p>
<p>ture of Police to the Director of the Surete Generate, as fol-
</p>
<p>lows:
</p>
<p>" 'Relative to the information I sent you on January 5
</p>
<p>flast, in regard to the Duverger (Therese) lady, living at
</p>
<p>10 bis, rue des Deux Gares, Arcueil-Cachant, and her rela-
</p>
<p>tions with the military automobilist, Beauquier (30th Com-
</p>
<p>pany of the Engineer Corps, Postal Sector 182), I have
</p>
<p>ordered a surveillance upon the correspondence exchanged
</p>
<p>between these persons.

<p>" 'From the examination of the last letters thus seized, it
</p>
<p>appears that this measure has no longer any usefulness.
</p>
<p>" 'I beg therefore to request you to inform me if, under
</p>
<p>these conditions, the requisition of seizure which I delivered
</p>
<p>concerning this correspondence cannot be lifted.

</p>
<p>"No allusion is made to Lipscher, whose name is not even
</p>
<p>mentioned.
</p>
<p>"And this despite the fact that before the seizure was
</p>
<p>finally lifted a letter from Lipscher was opened, which proved
</p>
<p>of even greater importance. It was dated February 14,
</p>
<p>1916. It contained mention at great length of a 'Joseph'
</p>
<p>(Caillaux's first name was Joseph) and of the reasons, which
</p>
<p>probably did not permit him to assume the 'management of
</p>
<p>the affair, contrary to his desires.' Lipscher quoted the
</p>
<p>opinion of two high German personalities, designated as
</p>
<p>'Jadot' and 'Oscar,' as follows:
</p>
<p>" 'Past events and the situation in which he (Caillaux)
</p>
<p>now finds himself, a situation, alas, too badly shaken,
</p>
<p>must have made him incapable of handling such affairs.
</p>
<p>Indeed, they see in him no longer the man who could dominate
</p>
<p>the opinion of the adversary He is no longer what he
</p>
<p>was, and would be unable to succeed.'. . . .
</p>
<p>" 'Under these conditions, I shall be in search of another
</p>
<p>element more capable and better placed. There are dozens
</p>
<p>of them, especially if the person chosen knew what are the
</p>
<p>real pretensions of Jadot & Co. I repeat it to you, proofs
</p>
<p>are in hand of the sincere pretensions of the part of Jadot.'
</p>
<p>"At this very moment, when this correspondence assumes
</p>
<p>such a tremendous importance, when the Prefecture of Police
</p>
<p>is advised of the far-reaching machinations of enemy agents,
</p>
<p>of their intention to address other personalities, the one
</p>
<p>already in view being unsatisfactory, the Prefect of Police
</p>
<p>requests that further inspection of this correspondence be
</p>
<p>stopped.
</p>
<p>"This request is submitted thirteen days later to the con-
</p>
<p>ference, which takes place 'every morning at the Surete Gen-

<p>There was another plotter against France, who was to be

<p>seen at times in conference with the chief conspirators, and
</p>
<p>then as suddenly lost from view. Today he would be sipping
</p>
<p>a glass of champagne in the Cafe de Paris, or driving a

<p>coach and four through the groves of Fontainebleau. To-
</p>
<p>morrow he might be found in a little wineshop in Marseilles,

<p>with a glass of red Burgundy on the black stained table be-

<p>fore him, and a group of chance companions gathered round,

<p>sidized pacifist newspaper. Any one of these rather risky
</p>
<p>but unusually profitable undertakings would have been just
</p>
<p>as acceptable to him.
</p>
<p>As it happened, there was more money in serving Germany.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, Bolo went out looking for German gold. He
</p>
<p>found it, and in great abundance. From a petty sharper
</p>
<p>and third-rate swindler he rose to be the Prince of Spies, a
</p>
<p>brilliant figure amid the glitter and flattery of Paris salons,
</p>
<p>an object of never ceasing wonder and gossip along the
</p>
<p>boulevards.
</p>
<p>To understand Bolo, one must know his life. From official
</p>
<p>reports of government investigators, it is now possible to
</p>
<p>reveal the whole story.
</p>
<p>In the year 1867 in Marseilles there lived a M. Bolo, who
</p>
<p>had drifted there from some obscure town on the Rhone, and
</p>
<p>who tried to please the patrons of his little cafe with wines
</p>
<p>of unusually rare vintage. In the quality of his goods he
</p>
<p>was extremely proud, and accordingly his business grew

<p>One day in the same year, he brought a baby into the wine
</p>
<p>shop, and announced amid the cheers and handclappings of
</p>
<p>the crowd, that the boy's name was Paul Marie Bolo.
</p>
<p>Among the wine kegs the child grew. It was an excellent
</p>
<p>school. He learned not books but men. He saw human na-
</p>
<p>ture undisguised by the hypocrisies of a more elegant society,
</p>
<p>for in the French cafe of the middle class, men and women
</p>
<p>gather during the noon-time or after the work of the day,
</p>
<p>to discuss the problems of life, no matter how trivial or how
</p>
<p>tremendous, no matter whether they relate to the planting
</p>
<p>of a garden or the overthrow of an empire.
</p>
<p>Paul learned rapidly, and when his father sent him to col-
</p>
<p>lege the boy decided that he already had education enough.

<p>The studies of the class room he found especially stupid, and
</p>
<p>after a series of escapades in which he sought escape from the

<p>struck out for himself,

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 97
</p>
<p>By nature he was singularly endowed. Blond, tall, slim,
</p>
<p>with silken moustache and coaxing eyes, of gracious and
</p>
<p>vivacious manner, he found many friends especially among
</p>
<p>women folk, and almost always to their misfortune.
</p>
<p>For a while he was a hair dresser, and later having learned
</p>
<p>the beginnings of dentistry, he established himself with a
</p>
<p>partner by the name of Joseph Boulan, in a prettily fur-
</p>
<p>nished office, which had every appearance of long established
</p>
<p>prosperity. At the end of three months the Tribunal of
</p>
<p>Commerce of Marseilles was obliged to pronounce the dissolu-
</p>
<p>tion of the partnership.
</p>
<p>From hair dressing and dentistry Bolo turned to the
</p>
<p>cereal business. He found a partner in a M. Panon, an
</p>
<p>artist painter, whose wife at once became enamored of his
</p>
<p>ready wit and flashy clothes, and who for a time successfully
</p>
<p>hid from her husband her newly aroused affections.
</p>
<p>Bolo and Panon, however, did not make money in cereals,
</p>
<p>so they turned to lobsters. Failing in lobsters, they tried
</p>
<p>to recoup their losses in a park and restaurant. When this
</p>
<p>final venture was about to collapse, Bolo eloped with his
</p>
<p>partner's wife.
</p>
<p>The couple fled to Barcelona, Spain. Finding Barcelona
</p>
<p>too big a city they gravitated to the more tranquil Valencia.
</p>
<p>At last all their money was spent, and Bolo sought employ-
</p>
<p>ment in a cafe, serving drinks and waiting on table, as he
</p>
<p>used to do as a lad in his father's wine shop. They lived for
</p>
<p>a time in a garret, until finally his companion gave him her
</p>
<p>jewels to pawn, and with what little cash was left, they went
</p>
<p>to Paris.
</p>
<p>At No. IS Rue de Strasbourg, a noisy little street, op-
</p>

</p>
<p>the traffic might also be heard the clatter of the ambulances
</p>
<p>of the great Military Hospital St. Martin, a half block dis-
</p>
<p>tant, the couple made their abode. They lived in a little

<p>shop, and with the cheapest kind of red wine, they just
</p>
<p>managed to keep body and soul together. From the Rue de
</p>
<p>Strasbourg they moved to No. 16 Rue Chaptal. Then by
</p>
<p>some good turn, which he never revealed, Bolo obtained
</p>
<p>enough money to rent a little apartment at No. 31 Rue
</p>
<p>Bonaparte on the left bank of the Seine not far from the
</p>
<p>Boulevard Saint Germain. Simultaneously he appeared in a
</p>
<p>wealth of new clothes, swinging a gold headed cane and
</p>
<p>carrying a Russian leather pocket-book that contained
</p>
<p>engraved cards, which proclaimed an office at No. 112 Rue
</p>
<p>de Richelieu.
</p>
<p>From here on the story is best told in the report of Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Bouchardon, which was made the basis of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment's prosecution and conviction of Bolo and his fellow
</p>
<p>conspirators.
</p>
<p>"The only lucrative transaction which Bolo had in this
</p>
<p>office," said Captain Bouchardon, "was a condemnation to
</p>
<p>a term of imprisonment. It came about this way. He had a
</p>
<p>housekeeper by the name of Mme. Miege. Having learned
</p>
<p>that she was the possessor of 1350 francs in a saving bank,
</p>
<p>he persuaded her to trust him with the money. He said he
</p>
<p>could make it return her wonderful profits, if invested in his
</p>
<p>business in the Rue Richelieu.
</p>
<p>"But Mme. Miege did not realize any income at all from
</p>
<p>her investment, and riot being able to get her money back,
</p>
<p>she began to waylay and threaten Bolo on every occasion.
</p>
<p>After paying back 500 francs, and not finding Mme. Miege
</p>
<p>any the less troublesome, he suddenly disappeared from
</p>
<p>Paris. The woman, however, still kept up the hunt and
</p>
<p>many years later sued him in the Eleventh Chamber, which
</p>
<p>condemned him by default to a month's imprisonment and a
</p>
<p>fine of 25 francs for breach of trust.
</p>
<p>"As for Mme. Panon, he gave her back to her husband,
</p>
<p>who was of such a charitable nature that he forgave both his

</p>
<p>"From one adventure Bolo dashed on into another. From
</p>
<p>one infamy he slipped gracefully into many more. We next
</p>
<p>hear of him in a railroad derailment near Hendaye. Bolo
</p>
<p>is picked up and cared for at the Hotel de la Gare, conducted
</p>
<p>by a Mme. Cabet and her young niece, Michaela Estouba.
</p>
<p>He soon conquered the affections of the niece, promised mar-
</p>
<p>riage, lived in grand style, travelled from Hendaye to
</p>
<p>Biarritz in a magnificent coach with gayly harnessed horses
</p>
<p>and costumed postillions. After he had fleeced the poor
</p>
<p>girl of her dowery, he again disappeared.
</p>
<p>"Then Bolo tried marriage. For him matrimony, the
</p>
<p>same as elopements, was a mere matter of business. Toward
</p>
<p>the 'end of 1893 he met a Mile. Henrietta Soumaille, who was
</p>
<p>singing in a theatre in Bordeaux. He became known to her
</p>
<p>as M. Grangeneuve. She sang for him, and he confessed he
</p>
<p>was completely captivated. He made immediate love to her,
</p>
<p>and she soon fell into his arms. He told her that he had
</p>
<p>just lost his mother, and that his share of the inheritance
</p>
<p>amounted to 700 francs a month.
</p>
<p>"Mile. Soumaille sailed for the Argentine with the hope of
</p>
<p>securing a theatrical engagement there, and her lover, whom
</p>
<p>she was already supporting, accompanied her. She obtained
</p>
<p>an engagement in the Casino at Buenos Ayres, and received
</p>
<p>20 piastres for each performance. But it was Bolo, who
</p>
<p>went to the cashier every evening and got the money. He
</p>
<p>had no other business. On April 14, 1894, he finally married
</p>
<p>Mile. Soumaille in one of the mayoralities of Buenos Ayres,
</p>
<p>and signed the marriage contract, 'Bolo de Grangeneuve.'
</p>
<p>"Finally, he revealed himself in his true character, for he
</p>
<p>could be by turns suave, courteous, entertaining or insolent,
</p>
<p>brow beating, brutal. One day he thrashed his wife, because
</p>
<p>she refused to give him her signature and permit him to col-
</p>
<p>lect 5,000 francs. Twice he played burglar and broke into
</p>
<p>his own apartments. The first time in Buenos Ayres he ap-

<p>propriated not a little of his wife's jewelry and a consider-
</p>
<p>100 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>able sum of money. The second time in Valparaiso he got
</p>
<p>away with a diamond buckle.
</p>
<p>"Bolo was arrested, and his wife, in order to secure his
</p>
<p>release, was obliged to deposit all her possessions as a guar-
</p>
<p>antee of his appearance in court. Once out on bail, Bolo
</p>
<p>wanted nothing better. He deserted his wife, and went
</p>
<p>direct to Albi, the home of her family. He told her relatives
</p>
<p>that he had just acquired in America a vast concession of
</p>
<p>land, where he planned to found a colony. He appointed his
</p>
<p>two brothers-in-law to choice positions in the new Arcadia,
</p>
<p>which he had named Port Tarasson, and he charged his
</p>
<p>mother-in-law with the pleasant task of recruiting emigrants.
</p>
<p>He gave her a great register, in which to write their names.
</p>
<p>For two days the crowds came. There was a never-ending
</p>
<p>line of people. Believing finally that the mystification had
</p>
<p>lasted long enough, Bolo again disappeared.
</p>
<p>"Here there is a gap in his life.
</p>
<p>"The next heard of him was in Lyons, in 1902, when he
</p>
<p>re-appeared as a representative of Binet champagne and
</p>
<p>Cusenier oxygenated absinthe. He organized a company to
</p>
<p>represent various commercial houses, a venture which cost
</p>
<p>his partner, M. de Civins, something like 250,000 francs.
</p>
<p>"And now Bolo again turned to marriage, and this time
</p>
<p>he found it a real road to fortune. It seems that he had
</p>
<p>meb a Mme. Muller, a young and pretty widow of Bordeaux,
</p>
<p>who had inherited several million francs. Again he made
</p>
<p>love and with all his old time success. They were married
</p>
<p>on May 15, 1915.
</p>
<p>"With Mme. Muller Bolo, our soldier of fortune returned
</p>
<p>to Paris a rich man. He leased a luxurious apartment at
</p>
<p>No. 5 Rue Denis-Poisson (near the great Avenue de la
</p>
<p>Grande Armee, at one end of which towers the Arc de
</p>
<p>Triomphe and at the other stretch the beautiful lawns and
</p>
<p>driveways of the Bois de Boulogne).

<p>could attract the most attention. The wife possessed not
</p>
<p>only a capital of 2,500,000 francs, but also 1,825 shares of
</p>
<p>Richard and Muller, worth about 547,000 francs, and an
</p>
<p>independent yearly income of about 47,000 francs.
</p>
<p>"By this marriage Bolo became a bigamist, but for the
</p>
<p>time being no one but himself knew it. In Paris Bolo insti-
</p>
<p>tuted an active campaign to make friends whom he might
</p>
<p>use. That he might entertain on a grander scale he moved
</p>
<p>to a more magnificent home in the Rue de Phalsbourg and
</p>
<p>established a sumptuous country place at Biarritz. He sur-
</p>
<p>rounded himself with many personages of high social stand-
</p>
<p>ing, who should have guarded themselves against his false
</p>
<p>pretenses.
</p>
<p>"At the same time he became engaged in all sorts of busi-
</p>
<p>ness ventures. He had full control of his wife's riches, for
</p>
<p>she had given him a power of attorney. He was to be seen
</p>
<p>everywhere, Venezuela, Colombia, Cuba, Champagne, Switz-
</p>
<p>erland, Spain. He was busy creating State banks in the
</p>
<p>South American republics. He started an 'emerald trust.'
</p>
<p>He promoted the affair of the Petits Bans de Presse, and
</p>
<p>founded the 'Swiss White Cross,' the Confederation Gen-
</p>
<p>erale Agricole,' and what not. But none of the undertakings
</p>
<p>seemed to succeed.
</p>
<p>"His life resembled a circus parade. He was often seen
</p>
<p>in Paris exhibiting himself on the box of a magnificent mail
</p>
<p>coach with a riding master and a footman blowing a trumpet.
</p>
<p>In Colombia he wore breeches of lion skin.
</p>
<p>"Bolo now took the step which lead to his downfall. In
</p>
<p>the company of Mme. Marie Lafargue, an artist of the
</p>
<p>Opera, who was singing in Cairo, he had met Youssouf Sad-
</p>
<p>dik, ministre de la plume, or secretary of Abbas Hilmi^
</p>
<p>ex-Khedive of Egypt. The secretary introduced Bolo as
</p>
<p>soon as possible to his master, and on that sarnie day, July
</p>
<p>5, 1914, the ex-Khedive made Bolo his financial agent and

</p>
<p>sole representative in Europe.
</p>
<p>102 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"Events were now moving fast. On July 25, 1914, Abbas
</p>
<p>Hilmi charged Bolo with the negotiations for the renewal of
</p>
<p>the Suez Canal concession, and some days later made him a
</p>
<p>Pacha.
</p>
<p>"Abbas Hilmi had been dethroned and expelled by the
</p>
<p>English, and accordingly, when the war broke out in August
</p>
<p>of this same year, he was all ready to throw himself into the
</p>
<p>arms of the enemies of England and become a German spy.
</p>
<p>"At this time also, Bolo was anxiously awaiting an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to mend his wasting fortunes. Hilmi and Bolo seized
</p>
<p>the same straw.
</p>
<p>"After the First Battle of the Marne, seeing the complete
</p>
<p>collapse of her plan of a sudden attack, Germany desired to
</p>
<p>effect a re-approachment with France, in order to be able to
</p>
<p>turn her whole attention against England and defeat her the
</p>
<p>more easily.
</p>
<p>"But it was first necessary to prepare pubic opinion for
</p>
<p>a separate peace. It has been proved by court documents,
</p>
<p>that in order to accomplish this end, the enemy was prepared
</p>
<p>to make heavy financial sacrifices. Our foes wanted to in-
</p>
<p>fluence the Parliament and the Press simultaneously. They
</p>
<p>had at first estimated that a certain amount of pessimistic
</p>
<p>news cleverly disseminated by agents who enjoyed good
</p>
<p>standing in parliamentary circles would be sufficient to cre ;
</p>
<p>ate confusion and destroy harmony between the Allies.
</p>
<p>"In the Press it was necessary to create desire among the
</p>
<p>people for peace. But this was difficult, because, if news-
</p>
<p>papers which were known to be pro-German presented this
</p>
<p>propaganda, its purpose would be suspected. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>it was necessary to veil this propaganda in newspapers that
</p>
<p>were neutral or even apparently pro-French.
</p>
<p>"Better even than that, Germany thought, would be the
</p>
<p>purchase of newspapers of unsuspected patriotism, which,
</p>
<p>in order to avoid awakening suspicion, should for a while

</p>
<p>continue campaigns favorable to the Allies. These news-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 103
</p>
<p>papers should not swing to the German side until the psycho-
</p>
<p>logical time arrived.
</p>
<p>"From every point of view Bolo was thought to be the
</p>
<p>man for the job. Without ever having indulged in politics,
</p>
<p>he had been clever enough to create for himself among par-
</p>
<p>liamentary and administrative circles, some very important
</p>
<p>connections, which, in case of necessity, he would not be
</p>
<p>afraid to utilize. In all instances he had displayed irrefu-
</p>
<p>table patriotism. He had been most generous in his dona-
</p>
<p>tions and his professions of loyalty. Apparently, he was
</p>
<p>rich, and the source of his wealth could be explained both by
</p>
<p>an advantageous marriage and the apparent success of his
</p>
<p>many ventures. Therefore, it would surprise nobody, if he
</p>
<p>were to invest large sums of money in newspapers, and secure
</p>
<p>control.
</p>
<p>"In a word, everything tended to draw him to Germany
</p>
<p>and afterward to render the proof of his treason difficult.
</p>
<p>His apparent wealth, his hidden ruin, his total unscrupulous-
</p>
<p>ness, his adventurous life, his love for excessive luxury and
</p>
<p>his extreme caution born from old-time necessity, all con-
</p>
<p>tributed to his success, as a traitor.
</p>
<p>"As soon as the Khedive and Bolo understood each other
</p>
<p>the negotiations began.
</p>
<p>'^During his sojourn at Vienna Abbas Hilmi had numerous
</p>
<p>interviews with von Tchirsky, the German ambassador, con-
</p>
<p>cerning the plan of a separate peace. Abbas Hilmi was now
</p>
<p>wholly devoted to the enemies of France. In talking with
</p>
<p>Viora Nourredin in November, 1915, he said:
</p>
<p>" *I have sacrificed myself completely to the German cause.
</p>
<p>I have joined the Turks and the Teutons against England.'
</p>
<p>"During the stay of the Khedive at Vienna and later in
</p>
<p>Switzerland, from December, 1914, to October, 1915, Bolo
</p>
<p>made three trips to Italy and visited Switzerland six differ-
</p>
<p>ent times. On each one of these journeys he met the Khe-

<p>dive or his representatives.
</p>
<p>104 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"On the first trip, December 26, 1914, Bolo met Saddik,
</p>
<p>the Khedive's secretary. They discussed a plan of establish-
</p>
<p>ing a great Catholic bank at Fribourg, which they might
</p>
<p>utilize for the pacifist propaganda in France. Because of
</p>
<p>its religious cloak the bank would not be as,easily suspected,
</p>
<p>Bolo thought, and in its vaults could be deposited the Ger-
</p>
<p>man money, which would be paid out as French money to the
</p>
<p>French press. On the surface, it would appear to be purely
</p>
<p>a religious movement. The cry of peace was to be raised only
</p>
<p>for the sake of preserving Christianity and the Roman Cath-
</p>
<p>olic Church. Bolo also told Saddik, that if his master could
</p>
<p>_raise 50 millions from Germany, he, Bolo, would do the rest."
</p>
<p>On an earlier journey into Italy, Bolo had presented his
</p>
<p>bank scheme to a former Italian deputy by the name of
</p>
<p>Cavallini, who had become a German agent, and who was
</p>
<p>later arrested and charged with treason. But Cavallini could
</p>
<p>not help.
</p>
<p>Cavallini, like Bolo, was strictly a soldier of adventure.
</p>
<p>He had made a fortune out of municipal speculations, but
</p>
<p>he soon squandered all his money, and began looking for
</p>
<p>other opportunities to regain his lost wealth. He had been
</p>
<p>condemned by various courts for various crimes, one of them
</p>
<p>being corruption and complicity in fraudulent bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>Finally, Bolo's plan of a bank of treason was submitted
</p>
<p>to Abbas Hilmi in Vienna. As the Khedive, a Mohammedan,
</p>
<p>was to be the head of this pseudo Catholic institution, the
</p>
<p>trap was evidently thought to be too crude. At all events
</p>
<p>it was abandoned.
</p>
<p>Bolo learned this sad news on a third trip to Geneva on
</p>
<p>February 14, 1915. Without loss of time, he next volun-
</p>
<p>teered to buy a great number of French newspapers for Ger-
</p>
<p>many.
</p>
<p>"After further negotiations with Germany, Bolo prepared
</p>
<p>to carry out his great scheme of treason," continued Captain

</p>
<p>entered into negotiations with M. du Mesnil, director of

<p>150,000 francs. The paper had suspended publication, but
</p>
<p>with the help of Bolo's money, it was enabled to re-appear on
</p>
<p>April 17, 1915.
</p>
<p>"Similar propositions were made to M. Chavenon, director

<p>of administration of Le Figaro, for 500 shares, and to the

</p>
<p>"These developments were communicated to Berlin for

<p>approval. Bolo submitted a report to the ex-Khedive, who

</p>
<p>and give any further information, which the Foreign Min-

<p>vance 10,000,000 marks at the rate of 1,000,000 marks each
</p>
<p>month.
</p>
<p>"Evidently referring to Bolo the German Foreign Minis-
</p>
<p>ter made this cryptic remark to Saddik:
</p>
<p>" 'As for the intermediary, we have information about
</p>
<p>him. You do not wish to give his name. I do not ask you.'
</p>
<p>"Things were now moving still more rapidly. Saddik
</p>
<p>brought back the glad tidings to his co-conspirators. He
</p>
<p>first reported to his master, ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi, who
</p>
<p>wired Cavallini to tell Bolo and make an appointment with
</p>
<p>him at Zurich.
</p>
<p>"Bolo responded instantly. Through an intermediary by
</p>
<p>the name of Porchere (who later becomes quite an important
</p>
<p>factor in the plot) he had this message wired to Cavallini:
</p>
<p>" 'Richard (meaning Bolo) will arrive Tuesday.'

<p>"Exactly on time Bolo arrived at the rendezvous in Zurich.

</p>
<p>Abbas Hilmi and Saddik were there waiting for him. Caval-
</p>
<p>lini was also present. When Bolo heard of von Jagow's
</p>
<p>plan of installment payments, he flew into a rage.
</p>
<p>" 'One million marks a month !' he cried. 'Are we only
</p>
<p>beggars? We must have at least two million a month.'
</p>
<p>"The conferees finally decided to submit a request of
</p>
<p>2,000,000 marks a month, for the first two months, with
</p>
<p>1,000,000 monthly thereafter. Saddik hurried back to Ber-
</p>
<p>lin and von Jagow, who at onoe accepted it."
</p>
<p>From documents seized by French authorities long after-
</p>
<p>ward under circumstances which they would not disclose, it
</p>
<p>was learned that the Khedive received from Germany on
</p>
<p>March 26, 1915, 2,207,565 francs, Swiss currency, or about
</p>
<p>two million German marks, and that part of this money was
</p>
<p>remitted to Bolo.
</p>
<p>And these are the papers which proved Bolo's treason:
</p>
<p>"First document, a communication dated October 8, 1917,
</p>
<p>by which the German Under Secretary of State for the Mili-
</p>
<p>tary Court sent to the Council of War a telegram from the
</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs, which read:
</p>
<p>" 'On March 20, 1915, the Dresner Bank (Berlin branch)
</p>
<p>has issued to the order of Abbas Hilmi three checks of
</p>
<p>735,855 francs, 20, each, Swiss money on a bank having one
</p>
<p>of its branches at Zurich.'
</p>
<p>"The first one of the three checks was paid in cash to the
</p>
<p>Khedive, the others were converted into one check on Turin
</p>
<p>and made payable to Filippo Cavallini for 1,557,323 lire, 15.
</p>
<p>"Second document, a check, dated March 27, 1915, for
</p>
<p>1,557,323 lire, 15, issued by the same Zurich bank upon the
</p>
<p>Banco, Commerciale of Turin, to the order of Filippo Caval-
</p>
<p>lini.
</p>
<p>"Third document, a letter under date of September 29,

<p>check.
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 107
</p>
<p>"Fourth document, a check dated March 29, 1915, for
</p>
<p>1,000,000 francs, issued by the Ramella bank on the Credit
</p>
<p>Lyonnais in Paris to the order of Filippo Cavallini, and paid
</p>
<p>to Cavallini on April 1, 1915.
</p>
<p>"Fifth document, the register of the Grand Hotel in
</p>
<p>Paris which shows that Cavallini was in Paris on April 1,
</p>
<p>1915."
</p>
<p>The final link in the chain of evidence, which bound von
</p>
<p>Jagow and Bolo together, was furnished the French govern-
</p>
<p>ment's investigators by M. Sottolana, an Italian baritone,
</p>
<p>and at one time a friend of Cavallini. After he learned
</p>
<p>that Cavallini was trying to use him to cloak a treason plot,
</p>
<p>Sottolana cast Cavallini aside, and told the whole story to
</p>
<p>Captain Bouchardon.
</p>
<p>Through Sottolana we also get our first glimpse of the
</p>
<p>ominous figure of Caillaux behind Bolo, a figure whose
</p>
<p>shadow grows blacker and blacker, as the Bolo ramification
</p>
<p>of the Great Conspiracy is further unfolded.
</p>
<p>Sottolana's sworn statement follows:
</p>
<p>"On the 1st of April, 1915, Cavallini asked me to do him
</p>
<p>a favor. He said he was about to receive one million francs
</p>
<p>and he would like me to accompany him, because it was such
</p>
<p>a large sum. We left the Grand Hotel, where he had asked
</p>
<p>me to meet him. He purchased a yellow stiff leather valise;
</p>
<p>hailed a taxi and ordered the chauffeur to drive us to the
</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais.
</p>
<p>"When he presented the one million franc check, the pay-
</p>
<p>ing teller said:
</p>
<p>" 'What ! Is this an April fool?'
</p>
<p>"Cavallini replied : 'No, it is not an April fool, but a real
</p>
<p>check for a million.' Then the teller asked if Cavallini
</p>
<p>wanted to make a transfer. The latter replied he wanted the
</p>
<p>cash.

</p>
<p>"After having waited about a quarter of an hour, he re-
</p>
<p>108 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>ceived the money. I could see that it was a lot of money,
</p>
<p>but I could not count it to know how much it was.
</p>
<p>"He took the valise to No. 17 Rue de Phalsbourg, Bolo's
</p>
<p>home. I waited in the taxi at the door. They came down
</p>
<p>together. Bolo left us. Cavallini then showed me the empty
</p>
<p>valise."
</p>
<p>Cavallini and Bolo tried to employ Sottolana in their
</p>
<p>mysterious and suspicious correspondence. They wanted
</p>
<p>him to sign code telegrams, or carry letters to various mys-
</p>
<p>terious addresses, but Sottolana declared that he would not
</p>
<p>render services of that character.
</p>
<p>During this testimony he was asked :
</p>
<p>"Did you not carry a letter to a lady?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>"Who was she.?"
</p>
<p>"Mme. Caillaux."
</p>
<p>Captain Bouchardon's report continues the story of Bolo
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>"Bolo was now well launched in his career of treason. He
</p>
<p>redoubled his activities in Paris, when suddenly he received
</p>
<p>word from the Khedive to come immediately to Zurich. He
</p>
<p>as promptly obeyed. His passport shows that he started on
</p>
<p>April 11, 1915, and went by way of Mondane. He had
</p>
<p>previously announced his coming in two telegrams to Caval-
</p>
<p>lini on April 8 and April 11. He wired that he was bring-
</p>
<p>ing 'Marie her bracelets,' and that it was necessary for
</p>
<p>Cavallini to advise 'the Doctor and Marie.' These mysteri-
</p>
<p>ous terms meant Saddik and the Khedive.
</p>
<p>"From the Khedive Bolo learned that the German officials
</p>
<p>who were watching him in Paris were not altogether pleased
</p>
<p>with the progress he was making. They did not see any
</p>
<p>results. Bolo proffered many excuses. He explained that
</p>
<p>it was by no means an easy task to obtain pacifist newspaper
</p>
<p>publicity in France in a few weeks.

<p>"The time had now arrived for the payment of the second
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 109
</p>
<p>installment of 2,000,000 marks. They were due at the end
</p>
<p>of April.
</p>
<p>"Before leaving the Khedive Bolo asked him to remit, not
</p>
<p>to Cavallini, but a man by the name of Necker, director of
</p>
<p>the Credit Suisse at Geneva, these 2,000,000 marks.
</p>
<p>"And this was how the German gold was paid. It was re-
</p>
<p>mitted to the Khedive on April 30 in three checks. A sum
</p>
<p>amounting to 50,000 francs was given at once to Saddik. In
</p>
<p>the bank of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, 250,000 francs
</p>
<p>were deposited in the name of Saddik for the purchase of
</p>
<p>shares in Le Figaro.
</p>
<p>"Another slice of 74,000 francs was sent to Cavallini by
</p>
<p>transfer to the Swiss and French bank at Paris, on July
</p>
<p>23, 1915.
</p>
<p>"Still another portion of 50,000 francs was distributed
</p>
<p>among Italian masonic lodges.
</p>
<p>"Later, because of complications which will be explained
</p>
<p>later, 723,000 francs were returned by the Khedive to von
</p>
<p>Jagow.
</p>
<p>"It appears that at this time Bolo received none of these
</p>
<p>two millions, and greatly displeased with his treatment on
</p>
<p>May 2, 1915, he addressed this telegram to Cavallini:
</p>
<p>"'Inform Verdi (the Khedive) absolutely necessary I see
</p>
<p>him this week, or shall cancel arrangement.'
</p>
<p>"Bolo saw the Khedive in Zurich on May 14, 1915, and in-
</p>
<p>sisted that he be given more time to make pacifist connec-
</p>
<p>tions with the French journals.
</p>
<p>"If we may believe the story of Leonard, a confidential
</p>
<p>servant of the Khedive, Bolo finally received from the hands
</p>
<p>of Abbas Hilmi a very large sum of money, which the ex-
</p>
<p>ruler of Egypt had counted out that very same morning in
</p>
<p>his bedroom in the presence of Mile. Lusange. The sum
</p>
<p>was made up of bank notes, mostly French, and they came
</p>
<p>for the most part from the Banca di Roma of Italy.

<p>"Immediately following this conference with Bolo the Khe-

<p>110 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>dive had a falling out with the German government. After
</p>
<p>leaving Bolo at Zurich Abbas Hilmi returned to Vienna,
</p>
<p>where he received a severe reprimand from von Tchirsky.
</p>
<p>The second payment had also been productive of no results,
</p>
<p>said Tchirsky, no French papers bought, no press campaign
</p>
<p>instituted, nothing. Abbas Hilmi was so overwhelmed with
</p>
<p>mortification, that he took refuge in Switzerland. Saddik
</p>
<p>deserted him, and Mohammed Yagghen Pacha succeeded Sad-
</p>
<p>dik, as Ministre de la Plume."
</p>
<p>Caillaux now entered the Bolo drama again.

<p>"On July 3, 1915, Bolo left Paris for Rome," said Cap-
</p>
<p>tain Bouchardon, "and on August 5 Bolo and his wife are
</p>
<p>to be found at the Hotel Beaurivage, at Ouchy, where they

</p>
<p>Bolo now decided to go direct to the fountain-head of
</p>
<p>German corruption. The down-fall of the Khedive presented
</p>
<p>this opportunity. Through Abbas Hilmi and Saddik he had
</p>
<p>treated with Germany second hand. Various intermediaries
</p>
<p>had eaten up most of the profits. Indeed, Bolo had received
</p>
<p>little if any of the second German millions.
</p>
<p>The situation was peculiarly delicate. As the associate of
</p>
<p>the Khedive he had fallen into disrepute both at Vienna and
</p>
<p>Berlin. When Abbas Hilmi had been ordered to give an
</p>
<p>accounting of the 4,000,000 marks from von Jagow, the
</p>
<p>former Egyptian chieftain was unable to show results. The
</p>
<p>acquisition of a few shares of the mordibund Rappel and an
</p>
<p>attempt to buy some of the stock of the Figaro were indeed
</p>
<p>very little for 4,000,000 marks So enraged had the German
</p>
<p>paymasters become, that before he was thrown out of Austria
</p>
<p>Abbas Hilmi was obliged to pay back 723,000 francs to von
</p>
<p>Jagow.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bolo undertook to assume full charge of
</p>
<p>another pacifist newspaper subsidization scheme in France
</p>
<p>and reap a full harvest of German gold. He began cau-
</p>
<p>tiously. With 150,000 francs he bought some shares in the

</p>
<p>Society of Professional and Political Newspapers. In lias-
</p>
<p>way he sought to come into closer contact with the news-
</p>
<p>paper proprietors and editors, whom he wished to exploit.
</p>
<p>He also negotiated for stock in La Revue and Le Cri de Paris.
</p>
<p>For a long time von Jagow had plotted to get control of
</p>
<p>Le Journal, in which Senator Humbert had been waging a
</p>
<p>most vigorous campaign for "More Cannons, More Muni-
</p>
<p>tions," and urging every other possible means to defeat the
</p>
<p>Huns. If he could buy such a paper and at the opportune
</p>
<p>time throw its support to the German cause, von Jagow
</p>
<p>knew that he would be able to sway French opinion vastly
</p>
<p>more than with an avowedly pacifist paper, like the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge. Bolo understood all this and believed Germany
</p>
<p>would give him great credit if he could get into close con-
</p>
<p>tact with such a prominent personality as Senator Charles
</p>
<p>Humbert, who was not only the director of Le Journal but
</p>
<p>also vice-president of the Army Commission of which Clem-
</p>
<p>enceau was chairman.
</p>
<p>With Humbert in Le Journal was associated Pierre Lenoir,
</p>
<p>who was supposed to have acquired a great fortune from his
</p>
<p>father, a well-known advertising contractor. Lenoir's wealth
</p>
<p>was finally traced to a German agent in Switzerland, named
</p>
<p>Schoeller. Humbert and Lenoir had quarrelled, and Hum-
</p>
<p>bert wanted to oust his rival. There was also a third part-
</p>
<p>ner, Guillaume Desouches, from whose presence Humbert
</p>
<p>also wanted to be free.
</p>
<p>Lenoir's German gold furthermore had not appeared to
</p>
<p>have had any effect on the policy of Le Journal, for the news-
</p>
<p>paper contii.ued its old-time campaign for greater military
</p>
<p>armaments and a more forceful prosecution of the war.
</p>
<p>Bolo learned the details of the internal snarls of Le Journal,
</p>
<p>and began laying plans accordingly.
</p>
<p>Humbert like Bolo had sprung from the soil of the prov-
</p>
<p>inces. Born in Lorraine four years before the Germans

</p>
<p>defeated France in 1871 he knew as a child the meaning of
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 113
</p>
<p>German Kultur. His parents were so poor, that many a
</p>
<p>night of his boyhood he went to bed supperless. The Hum-
</p>
<p>berts at last found German rule so intolerable, that they
</p>
<p>sought a kindlier province in what still remained of France.
</p>
<p>Forced to earn his own living, while still a lad, Charles
</p>
<p>Humbert shifted from one menial employment to another
</p>
<p>until at the age of eighteen he was working 16 hours a day,
</p>
<p>as a dishwasher in the cafe of a little provincial town. Had
</p>
<p>it not been for the compulsory army service of France, he
</p>
<p>might have remained in much the same stratum of French
</p>
<p>society; but army life has some opportunities, and, when at
</p>
<p>nineteen he wrung out his dish towels for the last time and
</p>
<p>marched away in a soldier's uniform, he took a long stride
</p>
<p>upward. For this humble but intensely ambitious youth the
</p>
<p>army proved to be indeed the road to fame and fortune.
</p>
<p>After two years as a private, Humbert obtained admit-
</p>
<p>tance to the officers' school at St. Maixent, where he rose to
</p>
<p>a junior lieutenancy. Later he became connected with the
</p>
<p>Quartermaster and Commissary Departments, and because of
</p>
<p>the notice of his superiors, he moved on upward in more in-
</p>
<p>fluencial positions, until he became the aide-de-camp of Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Andre. When General Andre was made Minister of
</p>
<p>War, he called his protege to Paris and gave him an im-
</p>
<p>portant departmental position.
</p>
<p>As soon as Humbert became interested in the political life
</p>
<p>of France, centering, as it does, in Paris, revolving around a
</p>
<p>few powerful men within the shadow of the Elysee Palace,
</p>
<p>he began keeping notes. Whenever he heard a story, either
</p>
<p>good or bad, of a politician, a financier, or a newspaper
</p>
<p>proprietor or editor, he filed the story away in envelopes,
</p>
<p>which the French call dossiers. He seemed to have a mania
</p>
<p>for learning the inmost details of the private lives of public
</p>
<p>men. So assiduous was he in gathering biographical skele-
</p>
<p>tons, that his collection came to be a constant menace for

</p>
<p>many a powerful French statesman.
</p>
<p>114, THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>In France a great number of political leaders have risen
</p>
<p>to power and wealth from the editorial rooms of newspapers.
</p>
<p>Clemenceau is the most striking example. Along this route
</p>
<p>Humbert also planned to rise. Through Philippe Bunau-
</p>
<p>Varilla, owner of Le Matin, Humbert obtained a position on
</p>
<p>that paper, and although he had never had any newspaper
</p>
<p>training he immediately evidenced the possession of other
</p>
<p>qualities, which more than offset this lack of experience.
</p>
<p>Tremendously aggressive, dramatically imaginative, he con-
</p>
<p>ceived a series of crusades to compel attention, excite the
</p>
<p>multitude, and increase circulation. He followed much the
</p>
<p>same lines as some of our most successful American news-
</p>
<p>paper publishers, or, in England, Lord Northcliffe.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, Humbert began exposing various public
</p>
<p>abuses, with now and then a trenchant attack against some
</p>
<p>politician or financier whom he depicted as an enemy of the
</p>
<p>people. He even went outside of France on his man-hunting
</p>
<p>expeditions. In one assault, directed at King Leopold, he
</p>
<p>accused the Belgian monarch of being the chief perpetrator
</p>
<p>of the Congo horrors. In these fights Humbert's dossiers
</p>
<p>became a most potent and terrible weapon.
</p>
<p>For fifteen years before the war Humbert had been urging
</p>
<p>national preparedness. His constant cry was for a stronger
</p>
<p>and greater army and navy. He continually pointed to the
</p>
<p>tremendous preparations of Germany. He warned the
</p>
<p>French of defeat, unless they awoke to their peril. Such
</p>
<p>then was the director of Le Journal, which Bolo plotted to
</p>
<p>buy for the enemy.
</p>
<p>After some negotiations Humbert agreed to take Bolo's
</p>
<p>money. Humbert explained later that he never dreamed
</p>
<p>that it came from Germany. An agreement between Hum-
</p>
<p>bert and Bolo was signed January 30, 1916, and on February
</p>
<p>12, Bolo sailed for New York from Bordeaux. From this
</p>
<p>point, the report of Captain Bouchardon picks up the story

</p>
<p>as follows;
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 115
</p>
<p>"Bolo was carrying his agreement for control of Le
</p>
<p>Journal and a letter from Humbert to J. P. Morgan & Com-
</p>
<p>pany of New York, stating that Bolo would deposit for
</p>
<p>Humbert's account 1,000,000 francs. He also carried a
</p>
<p>letter of introduction to Amsinck & Company of New York
</p>
<p>from the Perier Bank of Paris.
</p>
<p>"Once aboard the steamship, Bolo sent a wireless to the
</p>
<p>German, Pavenstedt, an Amsinck partner, whom he had
</p>
<p>already known before the war. On reaching New York Bolo
</p>
<p>showed Pavenstedt his contract with Humbert. He told
</p>
<p>Pavenstedt that he also planned to buy other Paris news-
</p>
<p>papers. To carry out the Le Journal contract Bolo said he
</p>
<p>must have 10 million marks, for the reimbursement of which
</p>
<p>he would be willing to pledge the shares of Le Journal.
</p>
<p>"Pavenstedt explained to Bolo that the proposition was

<p>not a commercial affair, and that he could hardly find any
</p>
<p>business man in New York, who would be willing to finance
</p>
<p>such an enterprise. 'I will speak to you frankly,' said
</p>
<p>Pavenstedt to Bolo, *I know of only one man who, in my
</p>
<p>opinion, might be interested, and that is Count von Bern-
</p>
<p>storff, the German Ambassador to the United States. Would
</p>
<p>you object if I spoke to him?'
</p>
<p>"Bolo at once agreed, but on the condition that his own
</p>
<p>name be kept secret. Accordingly, Pavenstedt went to
</p>
<p>Washington and saw von Bernstorff, with the result that on
</p>
<p>February 26, 1916, the German ambassador sent this cable-
</p>
<p>gram to von Jagow, at Berlin :
</p>
<p>" 'I received direct information from a source entirely
</p>
<p>reliable that a notable political person in one of the enemy

</p>

</p>
<p>Please reply by wire. A verbal report will be made as soon
</p>
<p>as I can find a person worthy of confidence to take it to
</p>
<p>Germany.'
</p>
<p>"On Feb. 29, Berlin cabled Bernstorff:
</p>
<p>" 'Reply to your telegram. Consent to loan, but only if
</p>
<p>pacifist action seems a really serious project, as it is ex-
</p>
<p>traordinarily difficult for us to open a credit at New York
</p>
<p>at present.'
</p>
<p>"Bolo, on being informed of this correspondence by
</p>
<p>Pavenstedt, prepared a contract, in which he agreed to pay
</p>
<p>back the loan two years after the termination of the war.
</p>
<p>There were to be no interest charges, and Bolo was to de-
</p>
<p>posit the shares of Le Journal in a bank as soon as paid
</p>
<p>for.
</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the war Germany had on deposit in
</p>
<p>various New York banks many millions of dollars. The
</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank, for example, had large deposits in the Guar-
</p>
<p>anty Trust, the Park National Bank, and a half dozen other
</p>
<p>New York financial institutions. Hugo Schmitt wasthe New
</p>
<p>York representative of the Deutsche Bank. Bernstorff de-
</p>
<p>cided it was easiest to draw on some of these deposits, and
</p>
<p>accordingly on March 5, 1916, he sent this wire to von
</p>
<p>Jagow :
</p>
<p>" 'Kindly give orders to the Deutsche Bank to hold 10,-
</p>
<p>000,000 marks at the disposal of Hugo Schmitt. The affair
</p>
<p>is full of promise. Other details will follow.'
</p>
<p>"The necessary orders were given, as appears from a
</p>
<p>series of telegrams between Berlin and Hugo Schmitt. It
</p>
<p>was arranged that the payment of the money be made in
</p>
<p>installments and pass through several intermediaries in order
</p>
<p>not to arouse suspicion."

</p>
<p>Perley Morse, a certified accountant of New York, under the
</p>
<p>direction of Attorney General Merton E. Lewis, of the State
</p>
<p>of New York. The French Government through Ambas-
</p>
<p>sador Jusserand at Washington had asked the New York
</p>
<p>State authorities to make this investigation. The facts were
</p>
<p>not brought to light until more than a year after Bolo's
</p>
<p>visit, for when he was in New York, living in sumptuous style
</p>
<p>at the Hotel Plaza and entertaining distinguished guests at
</p>
<p>Sherry's and other banquet palaces, no one but Bernstorff,
</p>
<p>Pavenstedt, or other representatives of Germany knew he
</p>
<p>was anything more than a very wealthy Paris journalist.
</p>
<p>His letters from Senator Humbert gave him immediate entree
</p>
<p>to J. P. Morgan & Company, the fiscal agents of Great
</p>
<p>Britain, with whom he opened an account.
</p>
<p>The investigations of Perley Morse among the books of a
</p>
<p>half score New York banks were made the basis of the follow-
</p>
<p>ing telegram from Jusserand to the Ministry of Foreign
</p>
<p>Affairs in Paris. It was presented to the Council of War of
</p>
<p>France on Sept. 26, 1917. It read as follows:
</p>
<p>"Testimony gathered and documents examined and photo-
</p>
<p>graphed by the State of New York demonstrate that from
</p>
<p>March 13 to April 1, 1916, the Guaranty Trust Company
</p>
<p>and the National Park Bank have paid out for Bolo's account
</p>
<p>$1,683,000 to Amsinck & Company of New York conducted
</p>
<p>by German- Americans. These banks had received this money
</p>
<p>from the New York agency of the Deutsche Bank of Berlin,
</p>
<p>administered in New York by Hugo Schmitt. From Amsinck
</p>
<p>& Company the money was transferred by its principal
</p>
<p>partner, Pavenstedt, to the New York branch of the Royal
</p>
<p>Bank of Canada. Bolo had been recommended to Pavenstedt
</p>
<p>by the Perier Bank of Paris.

<p>said he was utterly deceived by Bolo) $5,000.

</p>
<p>And what became of the last $1,000,000?
</p>
<p>The books of J. P. Morgan & Co. show that it was finally
</p>
<p>transferred to the Bank Perier. On returning to Paris, Bolo
</p>
<p>asked that this course be followed, and in reply he received
</p>
<p>the following letter confirming a cable to the same effect :
</p>
<p>June 10, 1916.

</p>
<p>adventurer Germany was realizing her scheme of getting
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 119
</p>
<p>hold of one of the greatest organs of the French press. The
</p>
<p>speediness with which von Bernstorff and von Jagow ac-
</p>
<p>cepted Bolo's proposal and advanced 10,000,000 marks,
</p>
<p>leaves no doubt that even before sailing for America, Bolo
</p>
<p>was sure that he would find all the funds necessary. He
</p>
<p>knew that Germany would furnish the money upon the
</p>
<p>security of the Humbert contract. His subterfuge in seek-
</p>
<p>ing Pavenstedt, as an intermediary, was simply a precaution
</p>
<p>inspired by prudence. Pavenstedt, himself, at last admitted
</p>
<p>that a cunning fox like Bolo knew that he, Pavenstedt,
</p>
<p>would of necessity call upon the German Ambassador for
</p>
<p>money.
</p>
<p>"Bolo's plottings were the most iniquitious that can be
</p>
<p>conceived. Beginning in a low and vile way he suddenly
</p>
<p>found himself at the very height of treason. Had he not
</p>
<p>chosen so many intermediaries, had he spaced his journeys to
</p>
<p>Switzerland a little further apart and committed fewer im-
</p>
<p>prudences of various other kinds, he might have realized till
</p>
<p>the end the whole fruits of his gigantic scheme. The plan
</p>
<p>was conceived with such perfidy, that even in spite of its
</p>
<p>collapse, Germany had the satisfaction of seeing how tre-
</p>
<p>mendously this scandal demoralized France."
</p>
<p>Spectacular as were the operations of Bolo, they neverthe-
</p>
<p>less should be regarded as only the outward evidences of
</p>
<p>Germany's deep laid plans to control the French press and
</p>
<p>implant in the French mind the insidious poison of pacifism.
</p>
<p>It should be remembered, that before Bolo went to America
</p>
<p>he visited the Bank Perier, and that in an inner office of this
</p>
<p>apparently French institution he received the letter of intro-
</p>
<p>duction to Pavenstedt, which proved the open sesame to the
</p>
<p>New York millions of the Deutsche Bank.
</p>
<p>Behind the French names of many banks, many industrial
</p>
<p>and commercial houses in Paris before the war, there were
</p>
<p>powerful financial interests, which led to Berlin and later

</p>
<p>system. The Paris offices of these institutions had French
</p>
<p>windows, but their vaults held German gold.
</p>
<p>The Bank Perier was controlled by M. Bauer. Founded
</p>
<p>by the family of Casimir-Perier 118 years before it became
</p>
<p>involved with Bolo, it was controlled entirely by French in-
</p>
<p>terests until Bauer entered its directorate. Finally the Ger-
</p>
<p>man power in the institution became so dominant, that
</p>
<p>Edmond Perier, the last of the family of its founders, got
</p>
<p>out. In a sworn statement, M. Perier has told the story as
</p>
<p>follows :
</p>
<p>"Bolo was not alone in this affair. He could not have been
</p>
<p>the sole author of such an enormous machination. It is
</p>
<p>necessary first of all to understand the mentality of our
</p>
<p>enemies. They are far sighted, practical, perfidious. They
</p>
<p>started this undertaking long, long ago. It existed before
</p>
<p>the Agadir scandal.
</p>
<p>"Treason requires the movement of enormous sums.
</p>
<p>Checks, which represent fortunes, cannot be paid in money
</p>
<p>orders, as one may do in paying a housekeeper her wages.
</p>
<p>Therefore, how can an instrument be found for this kind of
</p>
<p>work? What sort of a financial institution can be utilized?
</p>
<p>"It cannot be a credit house, because a credit house has
</p>
<p>too large a personnel. Indiscretions are to be feared. But
</p>
<p>with a private bank the task is a great deal easier. In a
</p>
<p>private bank there is one director. This fact the Germans
</p>
<p>of course understood. The Germans have always been careful
</p>
<p>in concentrating power in the hands of one man. It is
</p>
<p>unfortunately true, that by applying this principle every-
</p>
<p>where they have accomplished great things for good as well
</p>
<p>as evil.
</p>
<p>"Not only was the Bank Perier mixed up with the opera-
</p>
<p>tions of Bolo. There are other ramifications. In Brazil
</p>
<p>the bank at this moment has a German representative whose
</p>
<p>name is Albert Landsberg. In view of such facts, I think

<p>I have the right to say that this bank is using my name

</p>
<p>wrongly, a name which has been an honorable one for more
</p>
<p>than a century, but which has ceased to be such any more."
</p>
<p>(M. Perier sought an injunction to prevent the bank from
</p>
<p>using his name, but failed. He took this action, however,
</p>
<p>long before its relations with Bolo were exposed.)
</p>
<p>"The German power, the German connections of this bank
</p>
<p>must be constantly borne in mind to understand that Bolo
</p>
<p>was by no means the chief factor in the effort to poison the
</p>
<p>French press with German peace propaganda.
</p>
<p>"Who gave Bolo the letter of introduction to Pavenstedt,
</p>
<p>which resulted in Bernstorif's furnishing the German mil-
</p>
<p>lions ?
</p>
<p>"M. Bauer.
</p>
<p>"Who was present at the introduction of Bolo to M.
</p>
<p>Humbert ?
</p>
<p>"M. Bauer.
</p>
<p>"Who entered the Bank Perier not only to do a banking
</p>
<p>business, but also to play politics?
</p>
<p>"M. Bauer.
</p>
<p>"Why is it that the Chamber of Commerce of Rio Janeiro
</p>
<p>denounced the presence in that city of Landsberg, the Ger-
</p>
<p>man representative of the Bank Perier in Brazil?
</p>
<p>"Why is it that M. Arthur Tiret, a former student of the
</p>
<p>I2cole Polytechnique, a savant of great merit, should have
</p>
<p>written again and again to the authorities concerning this
</p>
<p>situation without having received a single reply?
</p>
<p>"How is it that the authorities close their eyes?
</p>
<p>"I know that other complaints have also been made con-
</p>
<p>cerning M. Bauer, and that special attention has been called
</p>
<p>to his frequent trips to Spain."
</p>
<p>At this point M. Perier became more explicit. Over the
</p>
<p>heads of Bauer and Bolo he pointed his finger at Malvy,
</p>
<p>whose ministry was responsible for such complaints.

<p>"Why were these charges ignored?" asked M. Perier.
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"These things took place during the administration of
</p>
<p>M. Malvy, and again I ask.
</p>
<p>"Why was no action taken?"
</p>
<p>From other court records it is possible to look still fur-
</p>
<p>ther behind the French windows of the Bank Perier. After
</p>
<p>M. Bauer obtained control, and the scandal of the issuance
</p>
<p>of the Ottoman Bonds was laid bare, the Bank Perier was
</p>
<p>found to be involved. The bonds were launched upon the
</p>
<p>public on December 13, 1913, in Paris, London, Amsterdam,
</p>
<p>Antwerp and Brussels. They were for 100 million francs
</p>
<p>at six per cent., in the form of treasury notes, redeemable in
</p>
<p>four years.
</p>
<p>Almost at the same time the French government was
</p>
<p>planning a loan of 800 millions to cover the expenses of the
</p>
<p>reorganization and the enlargement of her war equipment.
</p>
<p>M. Caillaux was then Minister of Finance, and it was an
</p>
<p>open secret that the loan failed because of his methods.
</p>
<p>When the war broke upon France in August, 1914, the con-
</p>
<p>sequences of the collapse of the war armament loan became
</p>
<p>fearfully apparent. There were neither cannons nor muni-
</p>
<p>tions to meet the most modern and most powerful weapons,
</p>
<p>with which the enemy was superabundantly supplied.
</p>
<p>At the same time that the French loan failed, the Turks
</p>
<p>hastened payment of some of their debts with French money
</p>
<p>and ordered war material from Germany.
</p>
<p>The Bank Perier was convicted and fined 8,125,000 francs
</p>
<p>for not having complied with the formalities prescribed by
</p>
<p>the law of May 25, 1872, relative to the launching of loans
</p>
<p>in France for foreign governments. Upon the appeal of the
</p>
<p>bank, the judgment was reversed by the Second Chamber of
</p>
<p>the Tribunal of the Seine, over which M. Hugot presided.

<p>The case was then carried to the Court of Appeals for final

<p>judgment.

<p>story of his dealings with Bolo :
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 123
</p>
<p>"Bolo was introduced to my partner, M. Marchal, in
</p>
<p>March, 1914, as a very wealthy and influential gentleman.
</p>
<p>He invited us to participate in his establishment of a mort-
</p>
<p>gage bank in Colombia. We did nothing.
</p>
<p>"Later, on hearing that we intended to start a bank in
</p>
<p>Cuba, Bolo offered to go there and act in these negotiations.
</p>
<p>Bolo asserted that he had some very important connections
</p>
<p>with the President of Cuba and also with a Cuban
</p>
<p>bishop. He asked us to give him a letter of introduction to
</p>
<p>our correspondents in New York, to the Royal Bank of
</p>
<p>Canada and the house of Amsinck, with which we have had
</p>
<p>business dealings for half a century.
</p>
<p>"Bolo went to Cuba by way of New York. When he
</p>
<p>returned we found that the affair had not succeeded. On
</p>
<p>another occasion Bolo introduced to our bank the Consul
</p>
<p>General of Colombia at London, who wished to borrow 250,-
</p>
<p>000 pounds in behalf of his government. Bolo received as
</p>
<p>his commission 1,250 pounds in Colombian bonds."
</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, Bolo proposed various en-
</p>
<p>terprises, M. Bauer said, as for example the supply of
</p>
<p>provisions and munitions, speculations in Spanish funds and
</p>
<p>the purchase of Argentine cattle. None of these schemes
</p>
<p>materialized.
</p>
<p>Bolo's treachery, M. Perier's revelations of the German
</p>
<p>interests in the Bank Perier, Germany's far reaching plans
</p>
<p>to buy the French press and spread the pestilence of pacifism
</p>
<p>and defeatism throughout the length and breadth of France
</p>
<p>were not revealed, however, until long after Bolo returned
</p>
<p>from America with his German millions. For a time, he
</p>
<p>flourished still more luxuriously, and in his sumptuous salon
</p>
<p>n the Rue de Phalsbourg, he mingled with many of the most
</p>
<p>influential men and women of France.
</p>
<p>It was at this time, which was indeed the zenith of his

<p>court of the King of Spain. Simultaneously the figure of

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>Caillaux again loomed behind the scene. King Alphonso,
</p>
<p>himself, told the story in a statement to General Danville,
</p>
<p>the French military attache at Madrid.
</p>
<p>"During October, 1916, I received a visit from M. Hum-
</p>
<p>bert and M. Bolo, who came to see me at San Sebastian," he
</p>
<p>said. "They employed several intermediaries to obtain an
</p>
<p>audience, among them the governor of the province.
</p>
<p>"The conversation lasted more than an hour. M. Hum-
</p>
<p>bert gave me the most interesting information concerning the
</p>
<p>military efforts of France, and spoke about the probable
</p>
<p>duration of the war.
</p>
<p>"M. Bolo, who seemed unfamiliar with military affairs,
</p>
<p>took but an insignificant part in the conversation as long as
</p>
<p>it dealt with such matters. The theme shifted finally from
</p>
<p>war to politics, and M. Humbert spoke to me about various
</p>
<p>political men, especially M. Caillaux. He said that the for-
</p>
<p>mer Premier had the highest esteem for me, and that he was
</p>
<p>keenly interested in events in Spain. This surprised me, be-
</p>
<p>cause in the past M. Caillaux had never seemed particularly
</p>
<p>friendly to me.
</p>
<p>"I asked for an explanation, but M. Humbert simply
</p>
<p>repeated the remark in various ways, each time calling upon
</p>
<p>M. Bolo to substantiate his assertions. Thereupon, I in-
</p>
<p>ferred that at least one of the objects of the journey of M.
</p>
<p>Humbert was to reconcile me with M. Caillaux, and that
</p>
<p>Bolo had accompanied him to confirm his assurances.
</p>
<p>"I also had the impression that M. Caillaux, who might
</p>
<p>return to power at any moment, wished to obliterate by this

<p>courteous procedure the bad impression produced upon me

</p>
<p>Germany now became exceedingly dissatisfied with the
</p>
<p>management of its defeatist propaganda in the French news-
</p>
<p>papers. Thus far the only good work, from the Hun view-
</p>
<p>point, had been done by the anarchist and Bolshevik pamph-
</p>
<p>leteers. Bolo's spectacular operations had apparently
</p>
<p>accomplished nothing. Despite Bolo's money, Le Journal
</p>
<p>continued its cry for the most vigorous prosecution of the
</p>
<p>war. Almereyda's Bonnet Rouge was adjudged by its Ger-
</p>
<p>man critics as lacking forcefulness and generalship. "Its
</p>
<p>articles showed that its editor had more emotions than
</p>
<p>brains," reported one of von Jagow's Paris agents.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact both Bclo and Almereyda were
</p>
<p>squandering most of their treason riches in luxury and
</p>
<p>excess. Almereyda had now established two villas in addition
</p>
<p>to his two extravagantly furnished apartments in Paris.
</p>
<p>One of his estates was at St. Cloud, the other at Parame.
</p>
<p>The maintenance of these country places apparently made no
</p>
<p>great hole in his pocket, for simultaneously he bought one
</p>
<p>of the most luxurious limousines in Paris, and within it
</p>
<p>enthroned the notorious Emilienne Brevannes. When Mile.
</p>
<p>Emilienne changed the shade of her hair, all the upholstery
</p>
<p>of the limousine had to be redecorated to match.

</p>
<p>Bolo and Lenoir had also forgotten their German masters
</p>
<p>for their own pleasures. More and more frequently Bolo
</p>
<p>was the host at banquets and masked balls in the Rue de
</p>
<p>Phalsbourg. On one of these occasions he distributed wal-
</p>
<p>nuts, as souvenirs. Each walnut contained a diamond
</p>
<p>Lenoir squandered his ill-gotten riches on the demi-monde.
</p>
<p>The full details of his treason were not revealed until years
</p>
<p>afterward, as will be told in Chapter XXI.
</p>
<p>What Germany needed for this demoralized situation was
</p>
<p>a hard headed, systematic business man, who could organize
</p>
<p>and direct a group of newspapers so to reach the greatest
</p>
<p>number of people as frequently and as forcefully as possible,
</p>
<p>who could engineer this press offensive the same as a Ger-
</p>
<p>man military drive.
</p>
<p>In casting about for the right man the Germans found
</p>
<p>M. Duval. In him they discovered a cunning, shrewd, active,
</p>
<p>persevering, painstaking, hard working individual, who in
</p>
<p>addition was the very secret of secretiveness except oc-
</p>
<p>casionally with women. At bottom he was a miser. He was
</p>
<p>as niggardly with his words as his centimes. He had few
</p>
<p>friends. Friendships to Duval were like clothes. He threw
</p>
<p>them away, when he could use them no longer.
</p>
<p>Before the war Duval had lived a wretched existence.
</p>
<p>Always believing he deserved success, he never found recogni-
</p>
<p>tion. From one small position he shifted to another. He
</p>
<p>always dreamed that someday, he would find a place, where
</p>
<p>he could exert all his faculties to the utmost and obtain
</p>
<p>wealth and power, but the occasion never came.
</p>
<p>The route by which Germany found Duval was long and
</p>
<p>circuitous. It led even as far away as Constantinople, and
</p>
<p>went back many years before the war. It was involved in one
</p>
<p>of Germany's many schemes to exploit Turkey, to obtain
</p>
<p>tribute from the industry, commerce, the natural resources,
</p>
<p>the public utilities, and even the amusements of the Ottoman

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 127
</p>
<p>Duval was assistant secretary of the Society of San
</p>
<p>Stefano, a company founded in 1910 by German, Hungarian,
</p>
<p>Swiss and French capitalists to build and operate a great
</p>
<p>bathing beach concession near Constantinople. It was to be
</p>
<p>a little principality in itself. The adjoining territory was
</p>
<p>to be developed into a great private park, divided into
</p>
<p>estates in which villas were planned to satisfy the whims of
</p>
<p>the most fastidious.
</p>
<p>It was to be made the greatest and most fashionable winter
</p>
<p>resort in the world. Here the wealthy classes of German} 7 ,
</p>
<p>Austria and Hungary might find refuge from the snow and
</p>
<p>ice of the short, dark days of the year. Here they might
</p>
<p>come in the luxurious express trains of the Berlin-to-Bagdad
</p>
<p>Railroad, in which Germany was also sinking millions for
</p>
<p>military as well as commercial purposes.
</p>
<p>Following their usual custom, the Germans brought in
</p>
<p>capital from other countries, taking care to keep the con-
</p>
<p>trol in German hands. Among the French share holders the
</p>
<p>largest was M. de Marcay. Yet of the 80,000 shares held
</p>
<p>by de Marcay, nearly all were for the account of H. A.
</p>
<p>Marx, a Mannheim banker. Other subscribers were M.
</p>
<p>Steiner, Hungarian; M. Widner, Swiss, and M. Volmasson,
</p>
<p>German.
</p>
<p>The Balkan troubles interfered greatly with the affairs
</p>
<p>of the San Stefano company, with the result that these first
</p>
<p>years were marked by many vicissitudes which threatened dis-
</p>
<p>aster continually. Meantime the Germans obtained complete
</p>
<p>control. Marx, the Mannheim banker, was the only pro-
</p>
<p>moter, who did not dispair. Finally he put nearly the whole
</p>
<p>of the Society of San Stefano in his own private safe.
</p>
<p>In this era of transition Duval entered the enterprise. He
</p>
<p>had been recommended to Marx by M. Dausset, former presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the Municipal Council of Paris, who held a few
</p>
<p>shares. Duval had been Dausset's electoral agent, had

</p>
<p>worked for Dausset's political success and done him many
</p>
<p>128 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>favors; and Dausset sought to show his appreciation by
</p>
<p>finding Duval a job. Marx looked Duval over, noticed his
</p>
<p>unusual reticence, his apparently complete self-effacement,
</p>
<p>and gave him a kind of secretaryship, at a salary of 250
</p>
<p>francs a month. Although M. Dausset later retired from
</p>
<p>San Stefano, Duval remained. He more and more devoted
</p>
<p>himself to the fortunes of the Mannheim banker.
</p>
<p>Duval thought he had at last found the one, great oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of a life time. He revelled in the thought that some-
</p>
<p>day, he would be an officer in a corporation which would
</p>
<p>control the greatest and most famous pleasure resort in the
</p>
<p>world. He had seen enough of German organization, Ger-
</p>
<p>man thoroughness of preparation, German financial gen-
</p>
<p>eralship. He worked so hard for Marx, that he frequently
</p>
<p>intimated that 250 francs were hardly enough for his serv-
</p>
<p>ices, but Marx always replied:
</p>
<p>"No. We have no money. Wait."
</p>
<p>And Duval waited.
</p>
<p>Duval was of the type of man, who always tried to make
</p>
<p>more out of his travelling expenses than his salary. He
</p>
<p>would account to his employer for a ticket and berth on the
</p>
<p>fastest and most expensive express, and then sit up all night
</p>
<p>in the dirty, foul smelling compartment of a third-class
</p>
<p>coach. But with Marx, he had so little opportunity to pad
</p>
<p>his expense account, that he constantly complained to his
</p>
<p>wife that the German banker was tighter than the steel
</p>
<p>jacket of a Krupp cannon. For example, in 1913, Duval
</p>
<p>wrote his wife:
</p>
<p>"Marx, as I told you, is charming, but he has not yet
</p>
<p>spoken to me about money, and that is what interests me."
</p>
<p>Again :
</p>
<p>"Marx gave me 500 francs, but I owe 150 francs to the
</p>
<p>treasury, which I must reimburse and I have to pay my hotel
</p>
<p>bill yet. That does not leave much."

</p>
<p>Also:
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 129
</p>
<p>"I shall try to make something extra on this. I can't
</p>
<p>tell how much, but what bothers me is that Marx buys my
</p>
<p>ticket, himself. I was expecting to make at least 200 francs
</p>
<p>on my transportation, but am left nothing."
</p>
<p>If it were possible to get an invitation to dinner and thus
</p>
<p>avoid the otherwise necessary expense of eating, Duval was
</p>
<p>always a most appreciative guest. Friendships which pro-
</p>
<p>vided food he gladly cultivated. In one letter from Ger-
</p>
<p>many, he explained that he was counting on an invitation
</p>
<p>to dine with Marx, and that otherwise he would not have
</p>
<p>money enough to pay his way back to Paris, "because," he
</p>
<p>added, "restaurants are dear in Germany." He said he really
</p>
<p>did not know how to spend his evenings, because if he went
</p>
<p>anywhere he had to give tips. There was no heat in his
</p>
<p>room. He had been thinking of getting warm by going to a
</p>
<p>church concert, "but," he reflected, "they might ask for a
</p>
<p>contribution."
</p>
<p>In Paris Duval and his wife lived in the meanest, most
</p>
<p>comfortless fashion. He figured his household expenses
</p>
<p>down to the centime. He always kept putting money away,
</p>
<p>and would borrow before drawing on his bank account.
</p>
<p>Duval delighted in books, in literature, philosophy, and
</p>
<p>all the other abstract sciences. In Aristotle or Kant hq
</p>
<p>sought to forget his narrow environments, the little, pinched,
</p>
<p>stale smelling home, where his wife cooked and washed and
</p>
<p>lived the life of a country peasant. Mme. Duval never read,
</p>
<p>because she couldn't. She had only the vaguest conception
</p>
<p>of even the titles of the books, with which she beheld her
</p>
<p>lord and master commune for hours and hours together.
</p>
<p>She knew nothing but drugery, and when he told her that
</p>
<p>he thought she ought to earn some money by working out,
</p>
<p>she acquiesced, because her poor, benighted mind knew of no
</p>
<p>other answer.
</p>
<p>Into the streets she went, looking for work. At last she

</p>
<p>boisiere hospital, which is situated almost along side of the
</p>
<p>Gare du Nord (Northern Railroad Station) and fronts upon
</p>
<p>the Boulevard de la Chapelle. Even later, when Duval finally
</p>
<p>plunged his hands into a veritable river of gold, he permitted
</p>
<p>his wife to continue to do the same menial work both at
</p>
<p>home and outside.
</p>
<p>When the war burst upon Europe, Duval's glittering San
</p>
<p>Stefano bubble burst also. But he did not forget Marx.
</p>
<p>On August 3, 1914, only two days after the German armies
</p>
<p>began smashing their way through Belgium toward Paris, he
</p>
<p>sat down and wrote the Mannheim banker a letter, which
</p>
<p>contained this cryptic passage.
</p>
<p>"The best way to continue to make myself worthy of your
</p>
<p>confidence is to await the end of the storm. Always ready
</p>
<p>to excute your orders, if you see fit to give me any."
</p>
<p>Was Duval offering himself to the enemy for sale?
</p>
<p>Did he now plan to make his San Stefano connections with
</p>
<p>Marx a highroad to treason?
</p>
<p>At all events, he kept in close touch with Marx, who
</p>
<p>established headquarters in Berne, Switzerland, where he fre-
</p>
<p>quently received his Stefano secretary in secret conference.
</p>
<p>In the first two years of the war Duval made as many as
</p>
<p>thirteen trips to Switzerland, and always for the purpose of
</p>
<p>seeing Marx.
</p>
<p>Through Switzerland Germany maintained various chan-
</p>
<p>nels of communication into France. Switzerland was the cen-
</p>
<p>tre of the German spy system. At Geneva, Zurich, Berne
</p>
<p>her agents met, took their orders, disappeared over the
</p>
<p>French border, and, thanks to Malvy's police, returned in
</p>
<p>safety. Switzerland also was the clearing house for German
</p>
<p>defeatist and Bolshevik propaganda, and from Switzerland
</p>
<p>the "press poison squad," as it came to be known, went forth
</p>
<p>to spread pestilence in France, Italy, Russia and England.

<p>declared war against Germany on April 6, 1917, was as-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 131
</p>
<p>signed to von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador at Wash-
</p>
<p>ington. Count von Luxburg, at Buenos Ayres, handled all
</p>
<p>German propaganda in South America, but he generally re-
</p>
<p>ported to Berlin through von Bernstorff.
</p>
<p>Marx, of Mannheim, was selected as one of the German
</p>
<p>espionage and propaganda paymasters in Switzerland. In-
</p>
<p>vestigations by the French secret service in Switzerland
</p>
<p>resulted in this laconic report, which is to be found in the
</p>
<p>files of the French Ministry of War:
</p>
<p>"Marx, a banker of Mannheim, whose bank was negotiat-
</p>
<p>ing before the war various government transactions, is at
</p>
<p>present established at Berne. His functions are to perform
</p>
<p>money operations in which the German Legation does not
</p>
<p>wish to show its hand, as for example, the payment of sub-
</p>
<p>sidies to agents."
</p>
<p>When the Berlin foreign office became more and more dis-
</p>
<p>appointed with Bolo and Almereyda, it sought through
</p>
<p>Marx to find reinforcements. Marx turned to Duval. The
</p>
<p>German banker and spy paymaster had come to learn those
</p>
<p>qualities in Duval which seemed to fit him exactly for any
</p>
<p>enterprise in which secrecy, perfidy, and hypocrisy were
</p>
<p>vital.
</p>
<p>In May, 1915, during one of Duval's visits to the Swiss
</p>
<p>Republic, Marx broached his plan. Besides Duval, there was
</p>
<p>also present an old time newspaper man, named Marion,
</p>
<p>whom Duval had recommended as a man worthy of all con-
</p>
<p>fidence and not "too scrupulous." Duval had once worked
</p>
<p>for Marion for only 200 francs a month; but both Marion
</p>
<p>and Duval were wise enough not to tell Marx how little some
</p>
<p>French newspaper men earn. With Marx they talked thou-
</p>
<p>sands and millions.
</p>
<p>Despite Duval's guarantee that Marion possessed discre-
</p>
<p>tion, the latter told the whole story to a woman as soon as
</p>
<p>he got back to Paris. She was Mme. Baux, and Mme. Baux

<p>told others. Years afterward, when the story finally reached
</p>
<p>132 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>the ears of Captain Bouchardon, the great investigator of
</p>
<p>the Great Conspiracy, she was summoned, as a witness, and
</p>
<p>testified as follows:
</p>
<p>"On his return Marion told me that he had met Marx, the
</p>
<p>German, and that Marx had spoken to them like this: 'If
</p>
<p>we had been better known in France, none of these things
</p>
<p>would have happened. We must have a newspaper which
</p>
<p>can serve as a connecting link between Germany and
</p>
<p>France.'
</p>
<p>"I learned that later Duval had gone to Switzerland alone,
</p>
<p>and Marion said to me: 'You know Duval made arrange-
</p>
<p>ments with Marx. As a result the newspaper will soon ap-
</p>
<p>pear.'
</p>
<p>"I protested, but Marion said: 'Come on, we will not do
</p>
<p>any harm. It is for the sake of peace. It is for a pacifist
</p>
<p>campaign.'
</p>
<p>"Later when Duval came to lunch at our home one day,
</p>
<p>he said he was going to start a newspaper in Paris, which
</p>
<p>was to prepare for the establishment of economic relations
</p>
<p>between France and Germany after the war.
</p>
<p>"But I replied that they were doing wrong. Duval re-
</p>
<p>torted that I was wrong in worrying about it. After that,
</p>
<p>Duval made numerous trips to Switzerland, and each time I
</p>
<p>could not help saying to him, 'I am scared to pieces at the
</p>
<p>thought of what you are trying to do.'
</p>
<p>"Yes, I hoped the censorship would stop the publication
</p>
<p>of these articles. My worry was boundless, when I saw these
</p>
<p>strongly pacifist articles were allowed to pass."
</p>
<p>On June 23, 1915, aboiit a month after Marx unfolded his
</p>
<p>pacifist ideas to Duval and Marion, there was a meeting of
</p>
<p>the directors of the San Stefano Company in Geneva, at
</p>
<p>which upon the recommendation of Marx it was decided to
</p>
<p>liquidate the company. The "task" of liquidation was in-
</p>
<p>trusted to Duval and two Swiss associates.

</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the San Stefano concern had nothing
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 133
</p>
<p>to liquidate. It had been dead for more than a year. Wit-
</p>
<p>nesses later were found, who testified there was not a sou
</p>
<p>in the treasury, even at the beginning of the war. The
</p>
<p>liquidation job for Duval was merely a blind for his de-
</p>
<p>featist campaign.
</p>
<p>Marx looked over the newspaper field in Paris, and decided
</p>
<p>that Duval should take hold of the Bonnet Rouge and re-
</p>
<p>organize it from top to bottom, that Almereyda should be
</p>
<p>permitted to remain its ostensible editor-in-chief, and in
</p>
<p>order to placate his avarice he should receive some extra
</p>
<p>money to permit him to continue the mad life of dissipation
</p>
<p>and excess, to which he had surrendered himself. But behind
</p>
<p>Almereyda, Duval should be the real power in the newspaper,
</p>
<p>should dictate its editorial policy, and should, himself, write
</p>
<p>a series of articles that would exploit all the most insidious
</p>
<p>and perfidious doctrines of pacifism.
</p>
<p>So one day in 1916 Duval entered the ramshakled offices
</p>
<p>of the Bonnet Rouge, and finding Almereyda at his desk so
</p>
<p>stupified with drugs, that he could not lift his head, Duval
</p>
<p>said to the office boy:
</p>
<p>"Call a taxicab and send your chief home."
</p>
<p>"Which home?" asked the lad in blank astonishment.
</p>
<p>"Any," replied Duval.
</p>
<p>Through the office the new business manager walked with
</p>
<p>slow step, examining all he found, re-arranging this, throw-
</p>
<p>ing away that, bringing what order he could out of chaos,
</p>
<p>and when he had finished, he sat down at Almereyda's per-
</p>
<p>fumed, opiate haunted desk, and wrote an order for cleaners
</p>
<p>and decorators to come the next day.
</p>
<p>"We want peace, but not a morphine peace," was his re-
</p>
<p>mark to one of the Bonnet Rouge reporters, as he closed
</p>
<p>Almereyda's desk, and turned to leave. Afterward, when
</p>
<p>DuvaPs deathlike reticence had become the marvel of the

<p>office, it was explained that he could not have uttered so
</p>
<p>134 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>many words on his first visit, if his tongue had not been
</p>
<p>loosened by the fumes of Almereyda's desk.
</p>
<p>Marion had already become the administrator of the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge, and Duval turned the details of the reorgani-
</p>
<p>zation over to his former employer. With Almereyda Duval
</p>
<p>soon became popular because of his inexhaustible store of
</p>
<p>money. Then too Duval was so modest. He preferred to sit
</p>
<p>in a back office, and let Marion and Almereyda see visitors
</p>
<p>and be introduced as the "administrator" or the "editor-in-
</p>
<p>chief." Duval had never wanted fame, but power. In a
</p>
<p>note book of philosophical reflexions, he once wrote:
</p>
<p>"Fame is the slave, power, the master of fate."
</p>
<p>In this same note book he also wrote:
</p>
<p>"I like theatricals, thanks to my passes. They show how
</p>
<p>the unseen brain of the playwright makes mere puppets of
</p>
<p>the actors and actresses. They explain the power of mind
</p>
<p>over matter."
</p>
<p>After he had taken hold of the Bonnet Rouge, he said one
</p>
<p>day to his stenographer in a burst of confidence which com-
</p>
<p>pletely staggered her :
</p>
<p>"Formerly, I was a very frank man. I have become pro-
</p>
<p>foundly hypocritical. It is the fault of society."
</p>
<p>In pursuance of his contract with Marx, Duval began
</p>
<p>filling the columns of the Bonnet Rouge with articles origin-
</p>
<p>ally drafted and passed upon by Germany's own publicity
</p>
<p>experts in Berlin. They were the result of the concentrated
</p>
<p>thought of Germany's best brains, and contained all the cun-
</p>
<p>ningly combined ingredients of psychic poison, which Ger-
</p>
<p>man "Kultur" could possibly invent.
</p>
<p>How these articles were traced directly into Germany,
</p>
<p>how they were phrased with such subtleness as to stir the
</p>
<p>passions of the French against their Allies and even against
</p>
<p>themselves will be told in a later chapter.
</p>
<p>In addition to the "made in Germany" articles, Duval

</p>
<p>st}*le of humor. He had always regarded himself as a master
</p>
<p>of irony. In his idle hours, before the days of Marx and
</p>
<p>San Stefano, he found infinite delight in writing essays on
</p>
<p>the foibles and weaknesses of human nature. He had laid
</p>
<p>these mental products carefully away in the belief that some
</p>
<p>day, when his merits were more fully recognized, he would
</p>
<p>sell them for a good, round figure.
</p>
<p>Duval's articles in the Bonnet Rouge were all signed "M
</p>
<p>Badin." Here is one, for instance, from the issue of June
</p>
<p>29, 1915:
</p>
<p>"Upon learning that the British were shelling the German
</p>
<p>trenches vigorously and had penetrated the enemy lines at
</p>
<p>several points without committing the imprudenr-e of going
</p>
<p>too far forward and install themselves in an advanced posi-
</p>
<p>tion, I conceived the idea of inviting my intiirate friends
</p>
<p>in order to celebrate this great event.
</p>
<p>"But the first one to whom I disclosed my intention, dis-
</p>
<p>suaded me. He said :
</p>
<p>" 'Your enthusiasm is premature. What you thought was
</p>
<p>an offensive was only a test of ammunition. The Allies have
</p>
<p>accumulated artillery and munitions for over a year. You
</p>
<p>ought to know that they are not going to squander every-
</p>
<p>thing in a few days time, to find themselves suddenly short.
</p>
<p>We have not only a stock of material but also an ample
</p>
<p>supply of patience. Let us increase the latter.
</p>
<p>" 'Therefore, postpone your celebrating until our terri-
</p>
<p>tory is liberated.
</p>
<p>" 'At any rate, you ought to know we are not in any haste.
</p>
<p>The poilus have become admirably accustomed to the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of troglodytes (cave dwellers). The civilians have also
</p>
<p>organized their lives for an indefinite prologation of the
</p>
<p>war. There is no need of hastening the end.
</p>
<p>" 'Furthermore, since the honor of beginning this ammu-

<p>nition test falls to our friends of Great Britain, be assured
</p>
<p>136 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>that they will act with coolness and calm, so characteristic
</p>
<p>of their temperment.
</p>
<p>" 'No foolish rashness. . . . Oh, no.
</p>
<p>" 'You may think that two years of war are too long, but
</p>
<p>what are two years of war? Without going so far as to
</p>
<p>look for a parallel in the One Hundred Years War, or the
</p>
<p>Thirty Years War, may I not say that Napoleon's regime
</p>
<p>was one uninterrupted succession of combats?
</p>
<p>" 'Come on, dear Monsieur Badin, do not worry about
</p>
<p>celebrating forthwith the final victory.'
</p>
<p>"As my friend's talk seemed worthy of consideration, I
</p>
<p>think I am acting patriotically in giving him this small
</p>
<p>amount of publicity."
</p>
<p>Duval tried to neutralize criticism of the Germans by
</p>
<p>making it appear ridiculous. Here is a typical example,
</p>
<p>printed for special circulation in the trenches:
</p>
<p>"The other evening, a friend of mine, a so-called repatriot,
</p>
<p>gave a dinner. As I was one of the party, I took advantage
</p>
<p>of the occasion to interview him.
</p>
<p>"He related to me such things, as would make the hair
</p>
<p>stand on end. He said first: 'I shall not discuss in detail
</p>
<p>the attacks on women. All the newspapers have furnished
</p>
<p>you this information. It is unimaginable. Things were so
</p>
<p>bad in one region, that we asked ourselves how the Germans
</p>
<p>could find time to fight, when it seemed as if all their time was
</p>
<p>occupied by their orgies. . . .
</p>
<p>" 'About their thefts and pillages, however, I shall be more
</p>
<p>explicit. You cannot imagine what a genius the Germans
</p>
<p>have for plunder. They can find a way to steal money and
</p>
<p>securities from people who never had any.
</p>
<p>" 'For example, prior to the invasion of the Teutons, it
</p>
<p>was thought there were only two pianos in the town in which
</p>
<p>I lived. Well, sir, after these Germans came they carried off
</p>
<p>fifty pianos. As for clocks, bronzes and other works of art,

<p>the crimes of the Germans have been positively fantastic*
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 137
</p>
<p>They stole about thirty wagonloads of these objects from
</p>
<p>the most miserable huts and sent them to the other side of
</p>
<p>the Rhine.'
</p>
<p>" 'But tell me about the atrocities. How about the
</p>
<p>atrocities?' I asked.
</p>
<p>" 'Well, sir,' he replied, 'they committed atrocities. I shall
</p>
<p>not enumerate or describe them. The papers tell you about
</p>
<p>them.'
</p>
<p>" 'How about the food question?' I asked.
</p>
<p>" 'They eat bread made of saw dust and a species of cab-
</p>
<p>bage. Once a week they have an imponderable ration of seal
</p>
<p>meat; and now and then a filet of salt herring half decom-
</p>
<p>posed.'
</p>
<p>" 'And you, what were you eating?'
</p>
<p>" 'Ah, there is where their cold cruelty reveals itself.
</p>
<p>Those butchers did not feed us any better than they fed
</p>
<p>themselves. They said to us, "Your countrymen are trying
</p>
<p>to starve us by means of a blockade. Well, you shall suffer
</p>
<p>with us.' "
</p>
<p>Duval constantly sought to stir the discontent of the sol-
</p>
<p>dier in the trenches by reminding him of his hardships, by
</p>
<p>insinuating that his task was as thankless as it was danger-
</p>
<p>ous. Here is one of his pictures of a poilu.
</p>
<p>"His moral and physical health was maintained in pretty
</p>
<p>good conddition. Only one thing worried him. It seemed
</p>
<p>to him that the ceiling was constantly lowering, that the soil
</p>
<p>of the trenches was rising, and that his arms were becom-
</p>
<p>ing shorter, when he was carrying food to his mouth. Fin-
</p>
<p>ally, he found a small mirror one day near a wall. He re-
</p>
<p>joiced over this, because he was going to be able to shave
</p>
<p>himself, but when he looked at himself in the mirror, he felt
</p>
<p>an indescribable satisfaction. His neck had grown extremely
</p>
<p>long."

</p>
<p>lines and made possible the victories of the French armies,
</p>
<p>Duval had this to say in the Bonnet Rouge of April 20,
</p>
<p>1917:
</p>
<p>"The workers express great joy because of their worldly
</p>
<p>goods. Flags of the Allies decorate the walls of the most
</p>
<p>humble lodgings. Before the portraits of our generals,
</p>
<p>flowers are renewed each day.

</p>
<p>grains and the cattle with bread. Meats and vegetables
</p>
<p>arrive in such great quantities that the consumer is disgusted
</p>
<p>with them. If no coal is found any longer anywhere, it is
</p>
<p>because the warlike ardor with which the whole nation is
</p>
<p>ablaze makes the burning of other fuel unnecessary.

</p>
<p>By the end of the summer of 1916 under the careful,
</p>
<p>systematic and ever active management of Duval, the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge had become a formidable organ of opinion. Its
</p>
<p>columns were filled with news displayed graphically and im-
</p>
<p>pressively. It's editorials were based apparently upon high
</p>
<p>authority and buttressed with comprehensive and timely
</p>
<p>interviews.
</p>
<p>An ever increasing flood of money was now pouring in.
</p>
<p>Duval made almost monthly trips to Switzerland, where he
</p>
<p>received checks from Marx which ranged from 77,000 to
</p>
<p>150,000 francs. He found Marx at Berne. He also con-
</p>
<p>sulted the German publicity agents in out of the way villas
</p>
<p>in the Alps, where he might escape the watch of the French
</p>
<p>foreign secret service, and receive instructions in the latest

<p>and most approved German methods of instilling the poisons
</p>
<p>of pacifism and defeatism into the French mind. After each
</p>
<p>return from Switzerland there was another peace drive in the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge, and another package of franc notes deposited
</p>
<p>in Duval's private safe. Duval paid them out with great
</p>
<p>discretion. He never entered these "receipts" in the ledger
</p>
<p>of the newspaper, but handed them direct to Aimer ey da,

<p>Marion and Goldsky, while to others in the office, who did
</p>
<p>not know the evil source of his money, the old miser doled out
</p>
<p>the German gold in "salaries."
</p>
<p>Everything in the office seemed to be running tranquilly,
</p>
<p>till one day in September, a reporter, named Landau, en-
</p>
<p>tered on the run. He had just leaped out of the tonneau
</p>
<p>of one of Almereyda's racing cars. The dust of the street
</p>
<p>made his eyes look all the more hollow, as he stared around
</p>
<p>fthe office.
</p>
<p>"Where is Duval?" he asked.
</p>
<p>Landau addressed this question to Mme. Lewis, a stenog-
</p>
<p>rapher, as she tucked away a loose curl and powdered her
</p>
<p>nose.
</p>
<p>"He is still out of town," she replied. "You want to see
</p>
<p>M. Marion, don't you?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, the very minute he is disengaged," said Landau. A
</p>
<p>moment later, two mysterious looking gentlemen, who were
</p>
<p>simply known as representatives of liquor interests, walked
</p>
<p>out of Marion's office and into the street. The next instant
</p>
<p>Landau was bending over Marion's desk.
</p>
<p>"I have just come from M. Caillaux," he said. "We are
</p>
<p>all to be arrested. Caillaux said so. He has seen the dossier
</p>
<p>ofDuval in the Ministry of the Interior, and he wants to
</p>
<p>understand all about Duval. He asks for certain explana-
</p>
<p>tions. We must see Almereyda and Duval, as soon as pos-
</p>
<p>sible, and have them consult Caillaux."
</p>
<p>Marion fairly leaped from his chair.
</p>
<p>"Duval is still in Switzerland," he exclaimed. " We must
</p>
<p>act without him. We must burn those papers at once.
</p>
<p>Quick, let us get them before anything happens."
</p>
<p>Orders were immediately issued to all the other members
</p>
<p>of the staff to tell no one of Landau's message of warning.
</p>
<p>Meantime Marion opened a big safe of which only two or

</p>
<p>three in the office knew the combination. He asked Landau
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 141
</p>
<p>to leave him alone as he sorted out various letters, which he
</p>
<p>carried to a back room and burned.
</p>
<p>Marion well understood the art of burning papers. He
</p>
<p>knew that many a crime had been traced from cinders. He
</p>
<p>had not only been a newspaper writer, but he had combined
</p>
<p>with journalism the more precarious avocation of blackmail.
</p>
<p>He had been condemned twice for swindling, and once for
</p>
<p>desertion. He had long ago made up his mind that he would
</p>
<p>never be caught again.
</p>
<p>As Marion crumpled up the last charred leaf of paper, he
</p>
<p>suddenly cried out:
</p>
<p>"What did Duval do with those last papers he showed
</p>
<p>me? Oh, I almost forgot them."
</p>
<p>Marion made one more search through the secret drawers
</p>
<p>of Duval's desk, to which he also had the key, and then said
</p>
<p>almost aloud:
</p>
<p>"He would not leave them here in this office anyway.
</p>
<p>They must be at his home."
</p>
<p>Calling Mme. Lewis he said:
</p>
<p>"You must do exactly as I tell you, and everything will
</p>
<p>be all right. The other political parties are trying to make
</p>
<p>trouble. That is all. I wish you would go to Duval's house
</p>
<p>and see Mme. Duval. She may be out, for she works in a
</p>
<p>hospital. Never mind, wait for her. No matter how long
</p>
<p>you have to wait, wait. Tell her to destroy all papers in the
</p>
<p>house, which relate to the Bonnet Rouge. Do you under-
</p>
<p>stand, all papers that concern his newspaper business and
</p>
<p>his trips abroad must be destroyed immediately."
</p>
<p>Mme. Lewis had won the confidence of both Duval and
</p>
<p>Almereyda. She was always called upon, when anything of a
</p>
<p>peculiarly dangerous natui'e was on foot.
</p>
<p>Through the streets as fast as a puffing Paris taxicab
</p>
<p>could take her, the faithful stenographer hurried to the
</p>
<p>Duval home. She showed Mme. Duval the letter, but Mme

</p>
<p>Duval simply stared:
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"I don't know where he keeps any of his papers," she re-
</p>
<p>plied slowly. "He never says anything to me about his
</p>
<p>affairs."
</p>
<p>"We must look, then," exclaimed Mme. Lewis impulsively.
</p>
<p>"Come, come." The wife still stared. "No," she faltered.
</p>
<p>"I know he would not like it. He never wants any of his
</p>
<p>papers disturbed. I am afraid to touch anything."
</p>
<p>With Marion's warning still ringing in her ears, Mme.
</p>
<p>Lewis made an effort to find the papers her master wanted,
</p>
<p>but soon gave up in dispair. Instead, she found a long series
</p>
<p>of notes in which the miser philosopher had expressed vari-
</p>
<p>ous mental abstractions, and among them a half completed
</p>
<p>treatise on the genesis of the soul.
</p>
<p>As soon as Duval returned from Switzerland, in response
</p>
<p>to a hurry call from Marion, he was told that Caillaux had
</p>
<p>become greatly worried by various press attacks upon his
</p>
<p>connections with the Bonnet Rouge. Landau explained that
</p>
<p>Caillaux thought that certain people in the Bonnet Rouge
</p>
<p>office were compromising him by various indiscretions.
</p>
<p>"The 'President' (as the Bonnet Rouge crowd always
</p>
<p>spoke of Caillaux) thinks that this newspaper talk about
</p>
<p>your trips to Switzerland will land us all in jail," said Lan-
</p>
<p>dau to Duval.
</p>
<p>"Yes, Malvy has been asked by Premier Briand to make
</p>
<p>an investigation of everyone in this office," interrupted
</p>
<p>Almereyda. "Malvy said that you should not ask for a
</p>
<p>renewal of your passport for any more Switzerland trips,
</p>
<p>until matters right themselves," looking at Duval as he
</p>
<p>spoke.
</p>
<p>"You had best go and see the 'President' and explain
</p>
<p>everything," said Marion, as he dusted off the lint from
</p>
<p>Duval's coat, noticing, as he did so, a number of seams that
</p>
<p>were worn threadbare.
</p>
<p>"No, no, I do not want to see M. Caillaux," responded the

<p>business manager of the Bonnet Rouge, turning toward his
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 143
</p>
<p>inner office, as if he would rather lock himself behind its
</p>
<p>doors, far away from Caillaux and everyone else. "I am no
</p>
<p>orator. I can say nothing to Caillaux."
</p>
<p>But his associates persisted. They were afraid they
</p>
<p>would lose Caillaux's friendship. They thought that if
</p>
<p>Malvy's master was not propitiated there would be no more
</p>
<p>passports, no more checks from Switzerland.
</p>
<p>Duval continued obdurate. He would not listen to argu-
</p>
<p>ment, and so at last his confreres decided upon a strategem.
</p>
<p>They drove up to the Bonnet Rouge office one day in one of
</p>
<p>Almereyda's finest automobiles, and announced that they
</p>
<p>were all going to the Caillaux country place at Mamers to in-
</p>
<p>troduce Landau's fiancee to the "President." They went
</p>
<p>into Duval's stuffy office, and tried to drag him out.
</p>
<p>"You must come along too," insisted Landau. "You will
</p>
<p>enjoy the ride. You are working too hard."
</p>
<p>"No, I must work," replied Duval doggedly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I wish you would come," said a handsomely gowned
</p>
<p>lady, whose veil just revealed her round, limpid eyes. She
</p>
<p>had entered quietly, and now stood at Duval's very elbow.
</p>
<p>The old man gallantly sprang to his feet . He was already
</p>
<p>conquered.
</p>
<p>"Mile. Vial, my fiancee," explained Landau, stepping for-
</p>
<p>ward.
</p>
<p>"Yes, and you will sit right next to me," added Mile.
</p>
<p>Vial.
</p>
<p>And so she did. Landau climbed in with the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>Duval sat in one luxurious corner of the tonneau and the
</p>
<p>only lady in the party leaned gently against his shoulder.
</p>
<p>Marion and Goldsky, who had been a nurse and stretcher
</p>
<p>bearer in the army, before he got a job on the Bonnet Rouge
</p>
<p>and wrote with all the authority of another Napoleon under
</p>
<p>the pen camouflage of "Gen. N ," sat opposite.

</p>
<p>Vial his words scintillated with flashes of wit, with now and
</p>
<p>then touches of satire, historic allusions, or the reflections of
</p>
<p>his own quaint philosophy.
</p>
<p>"The old crab has certainly crawled out of his shell,"
</p>
<p>whispered Goldsky to Marion, as the party stepped out
</p>
<p>upon the velvet lawn of the Caillaux villa.
</p>
<p>Duval was going to climb back into the automobile when
</p>
<p>Landau said:
</p>
<p>"M. Caillaux will be delighted to see you. Now is your
</p>
<p>opportunity to straighten everything out."
</p>
<p>Duval drew Landau to one side, and replied :
</p>
<p>"No, no. I cannot ask for my passport now. Caillaux
</p>
<p>will not dare help me. I do not wish to attract attention.
</p>
<p>I must keep in the back ground."
</p>
<p>"Oh, you have said all that before," laughed Landau.
</p>
<p>"True then, true now," insisted !Duval. "Furthermore, I
</p>
<p>don't think M. Caillaux will receive me."
</p>
<p>Again Mile. Vial went to the rescue.
</p>
<p>"M. Caillaux will certainly enjoy a man of your mental-
</p>
<p>ity," she said, taking Duval by the arm. "Why, I think you
</p>
<p>are a great deal more clever, than he."
</p>
<p>With Mile. Vial on one side, and Landau on the other,
</p>
<p>Duval walked through the great doorway, and permitted his
</p>
<p>name to be announced.
</p>
<p>"You must have confidence in Caillaux's star," said Lan-
</p>
<p>dau to Duval, while they waited. "You must have faith in
</p>

<p>Third Council of War, at a trial which later will be described

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 145
</p>
<p>in detail, the far reaching importance of this automobile trip
</p>
<p>to Mamers has been set forth in the following language :
</p>
<p>"Up to the last minute neither Marion nor Duval thought
</p>
<p>that they would be invited in. The truth of the matter was
</p>
<p>that M. Caillaux was not particularly pleased to receive in
</p>
<p>his country retreat of Mamers, in a peaceful corner of a
</p>
<p>peaceful province, such boisterous guests as Duval's com-
</p>
<p>panions.
</p>
<p>"Just the same M. Caillaux consented to see them. That
</p>
<p>the interview was not entirely cordial is not to be doubted.
</p>
<p>They were not asked to stay to luncheon. As Marion said
</p>
<p>afterward, 'I realized that after all we were not expected.
</p>
<p>M. Caillaux pretexted a luncheon at the General Council to
</p>
<p>excuse himself for not being our host.'
</p>
<p>"Caillaux's excuses, however, showed he was courteous and
</p>
<p>interpreted the visit as an act of good will. If they did not
</p>
<p>sit down at the Caillaux family table, they drank the Caillaux
</p>
<p>Oporto wine and accepted the Caillaux cigars.
</p>
<p>"I am sure that while returning from Mamers to Paris,
</p>
<p>Duval was able to say to himself :
</p>
<p>" 'Henceforth, I will be able to do anything. I have been
</p>
<p>received by a former Premier of France, who knows my rela-
</p>
<p>tions with Marx. I am perfectly safe from now on.'
</p>
<p>"And to inspire Duval with still greater confidence, Lan-
</p>
<p>dau and Goldsky said to him:
</p>
<p>" 'You need have no more hesitancy about going to the
</p>
<p>police and asking for a passport. We will go with you, and
</p>
<p>have M. Leymarie, M. Malvy's assistant, take care of you.'
</p>
<p>"And Landau and Goldsky made good their promise.
</p>
<p>They introduced Duval to the Minister of the Interior, who
</p>
<p>received him with this greeting :
</p>
<p>" 'You wish to go to Switzerland to see Marx? All right,
</p>
<p>you shall have your passport.' '
</p>
<p>Long after the Mamers interview, tell tale papers were

</p>
<p>discovered by the French foreign secret service associated
</p>
<p>146 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>with the Italian police, which prompt the following questions :
</p>
<p>(1) When Caillaux and Duval met, did not these two
</p>
<p>men already understand they were working for the same
</p>
<p>master?
</p>
<p>(2) Did not both of them know Marx?
</p>
<p>(3) Did Duval tell Caillaux that he had obtained checks
</p>
<p>from Marx to liquidate the San Stefano Company, or to
</p>
<p>spread German propaganda in France?
</p>
<p>The documents which provoke these speculations were
</p>
<p>found in Caillaux's strong box in Florence along with the
</p>
<p>papers which revealed his plans of a socialist coup d'etat.
</p>
<p>They proved that Caillaux also had had dealings with Marx.
</p>
<p>They indicated that when Therese Duverger was caught with
</p>
<p>Beauquier, and it became known that Lipscher through his
</p>
<p>mistress was seeking interviews with Caillaux, Germany im-
</p>
<p>mediately dropped Lipscher and the Duverger woman, and
</p>
<p>turned to Marx.
</p>
<p>Through Marx new lines were to be established between
</p>
<p>Paris and Berlin, by which official messages could be carried
</p>
<p>to Caillaux and his power again invoked in another tremen-
</p>
<p>dous drive for a separate peace. Germany's latest terms
</p>
<p>had to be delivered into his hands in a way, which would
</p>
<p>persuade him that they were backed by the Kaiser himself.
</p>
<p>Two papers in Caillaux's safe deposit vault related to
</p>
<p>Marx. One was typewritten. It read:
</p>
<p>"M. Lipscher, as an intermediary, does not seem desirable.
</p>
<p>I place myself at your disposal and am authorized to establish
</p>
<p>the communications which you desire."
</p>
<p>The second paper was in hand-writing, and read:
</p>
<p>"H. A. Marx, in care of Professor Ersberg, 27 Steiner-
</p>
<p>strasse, Berne."
</p>
<p>The signature was later compared with that of the Marx,
</p>
<p>who was paying treason money to Duval. Both were identi-
</p>
<p>cally the same. Investigation of the activities of Professor

<p>agents of Germany, from whose pen emanated much of the
</p>
<p>most insidious peace propaganda, which Germany had been
</p>
<p>sending its press agents in France and other countries.
</p>
<p>Stationed in Switzerland, Professor Ersberg kept in constant
</p>
<p>touch with Berlin.
</p>
<p>When these documents fell into the hands of French offi-
</p>
<p>cials in Clemenceau's investigation of the Great Conspiracy,
</p>
<p>Caillaux was asked for an explanation. In a statement be-
</p>
<p>fore Captain Bouchardon, the ex-Premier said:
</p>
<p>"Some time after the attempts of Lipscher to talk with me,
</p>
<p>a gentleman asked me for an appointment by telephone. He
</p>
<p>told me that he was a prominent Swiss merchant and wished
</p>
<p>to speak to me about some economic questions relating to
</p>
<p>France.
</p>
<p>"I granted the appointment. The man came to my home.
</p>
<p>But he had hardly entered my cabinet, when he handed me an
</p>
<p>envelope containing the two bits of paper, which are the
</p>
<p>ones seized in my deposit box. I at once told the visitor to
</p>
<p>leave my house."
</p>
<p>"Why did you not immediately arrest the man who came
</p>
<p>to your house to take Lipscher's place?" questioned Captain
</p>
<p>Bouchardon.
</p>
<p>"Arrest him?" repeated Caillaux, as if astonished at the
</p>
<p>impudence of such a thought. "Have him arrested at once?
</p>
<p>How could I have done that?"

<p>Caillaux's connections with Marx, the enemy paymaster,
</p>
<p>however, were not discovered until the Bonnet Rouge gang
</p>
<p>had been operating a German spy clearing house in the heart
</p>
<p>of Paris for at least three years.
</p>
<p>If Caillaux cautioned Duval that the Bonnet Rouge had
</p>
<p>grown too bold, his warnings were of no avail. The office of
</p>
<p>the newspaper became more and more the headquarters of
</p>
<p>enemy agents, whose operations extended into nearly every
</p>
<p>other European country and even to America. Almereyda
</p>
<p>made almost as many trips to Spain as Duval did to Switzer-
</p>
<p>land. During July and August, 1916, Marion voyaged to
</p>
<p>the United States. According to the records of the Paris
</p>
<p>police, he tried to obtain the aid of Henry Ford in an inter-
</p>
<p>national peace movement.
</p>
<p>In Spain the Germans were becoming more and more
</p>
<p>active. They were establishing various espionage and propa-
</p>
<p>ganda centers, buying Spanish newspapers, starting new
</p>
<p>ones, and everywhere they were preaching the same gospel
</p>
<p>of a false peace. Spain also proved to be an especially good

<p>France they could cross the Pyrenees easier than the Alps,
</p>
<p>or still better they could report to German submarines
</p>
<p>skulking along the Spanish coast. At Carthegena the U
</p>
<p>boats found a particularly convenient rendezvous.
</p>
<p>During the first half of 1916 Germany was anxiously
</p>
<p>watching Roumania. The court at Bucharest was honey-
</p>
<p>combed with German agents following every development.
</p>
<p>German engineers in various disguises were measuring roads
</p>
<p>and bridges and mapping out all other lines of communica-
</p>
<p>tion in Roumania, so that German armies might strike a
</p>
<p>sure blow as soon as the Roumanians declared war on the
</p>
<p>side of the Allies.
</p>
<p>In France also the Berlin spy system was at work just as
</p>
<p>assiduously. In France the particular purpose of Germany's
</p>
<p>inquiry was to learn what aid in case of war Roumania could
</p>
<p>get from the Entente. At Salonika an army had been organ-
</p>
<p>ied by the Allies for operations in the Balkans, and Germany
</p>
<p>was using every means to learn just how these troops were
</p>
<p>being reinforced and equipped, and what they would be able
</p>
<p>to do.
</p>
<p>At the head of the French army at Salonika was General
</p>
<p>Sarrail, the friend of Caillaux. According to Caillaux's
</p>
<p>plans for a coup d' etat General Sarrail was to have become
</p>
<p>his Commander-in-Chief.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 191 6, M. Paix-Se.illes, a sergeant in the
</p>
<p>French army, received from Captain Mathieu, who had been
</p>
<p>stationed in the Orient, a bundle of letters giving detailed
</p>
<p>information concerning the strength and resources of the
</p>
<p>forces commanded by General Sarrail. Some of the letters
</p>
<p>contained secret military reports for transmission to the
</p>
<p>Ministry of War in Paris. Other papers included a com-
</p>
<p>munication from General Sarrail to M. Noulens, President of
</p>
<p>the Army Commission, and copies of two telegrams, one
</p>
<p>from the Premier to the French minister at Athens, for

<p>transmission to General Sarrail,

<p>150 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>According to Leon Daudet, these papers were given to
</p>
<p>Malvy who passed them to Leymarie, his assistant, who
</p>
<p>passed them to Almereyda. After Paix-Seailles had been
</p>
<p>arrested he said that he had given them direct to Almereyda.
</p>
<p>At all events they came into the possession of the Apache
</p>
<p>editor, who took them to the office of the Bonnet Rouge.
</p>
<p>What happened there is told by Mme. Lewis, the confidential
</p>
<p>stenographer of the inner office. Many months later she was
</p>
<p>called as a witness and testified as follows :
</p>
<p>"One morning in June, 1916, M. Marion asked me to come
</p>
<p>into his office to copy some documents. He said that they
</p>
<p>were for the Minister of War. I remember that among other
</p>
<p>papers were three typewritten letters and a manuscript let-
</p>
<p>ter. M. Marion also said that he had need of these docu-
</p>
<p>ments, because he intended to go on a journey. Mile Louise
</p>
<p>Legendre will be able to testify to this, as she also remem-
</p>
<p>bers it." (Mile. Legendre was another Bonnet Rouge stenog-
</p>
<p>rapher. She corroborated Mme. Lewis in every particular.)
</p>
<p>"Did you copy the documents?"
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>"Do you remember how many copies you made?"
</p>
<p>"Three or four."
</p>
<p>"You would be able to recognize them?"
</p>
<p>"I have already identified them before Captain Bouchar-
</p>
<p>don."
</p>
<p>"Did M. Marion shut you up in a room?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, he shut me up, but as soon as he went away, I came
</p>
<p>out and I said to the other stenographers: 'Marion has
</p>
<p>given me something to copy. He told me not to tell any-
</p>
<p>body.' "
</p>
<p>The documents were laid before Mme. Lewis, and she said :
</p>
<p>"Those are the papers I copied." (They included the
</p>
<p>official communications of General Sarrail mentioned above.)
</p>
<p>"Did M. Marion say where he intended to go on that

</p>
<p>journey?" Mme. Lewis was asked.
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 151
</p>
<p>"Yes, he said he was going to Spain that night."
</p>
<p>When Marion was examined two years later and asked
</p>
<p>how he obtained the official documents of the War Depart-
</p>
<p>ment, he explained:
</p>
<p>"Almereyda came to me and asked, 'Have you got a good
</p>
<p>stenographer?'
</p>
<p>"I answered, 'Yes, Why?' "
</p>
<p>" 'Well, here you are,' he said. 'I have a friend, also a
</p>
<p>newspaper collaborator, who has got hold of some letters of
</p>
<p>a very confidential nature concerning the military situation
</p>
<p>in Salonika. The writing of some of the letters is almost
</p>
<p>undecipherable. So the Bonnet Rouge stenographer will not
</p>
<p>copy them correctly, if she is not a good one. As you
</p>
<p>say yours is a capable girl, will you have Her make some
</p>
<p>copies ?' "
</p>
<p>"I replied, 'Very well, I understand.' I did not know any-
</p>
<p>thing about the letters. I only took a superficial glance at
</p>
<p>them. You see, I was only asked to have them copied. Well,
</p>
<p>they were taken into my office. As it was quite a task, I
</p>
<p>asked my stenographer who usually worked in a place along-
</p>
<p>side of the telephone switch board to come into my office,
</p>
<p>that she might work without being distracted. She did the
</p>
<p>work in about two hours, and then I turned them back im-
</p>
<p>mediately to Almereyda."
</p>
<p>"Did you know these papers contained military secrets?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, no. I had not the slightest idea that they were secret
</p>
<p>documents."
</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, you took various precautions. In the first
</p>
<p>place you put this stenographer in your own private office.
</p>
<p>You told her not to say anything about the matter to any-
</p>
<p>one, did you not?"
</p>
<p>"Exactly, and I will tell you why. Almereyda said to
</p>
<p>me,
</p>
<p>" 'These are not secret documents, but confidential letters.

</p>
<p>and I would not wish that they fall into the hands of others
</p>
<p>who might use them before I do. Furthermore, I must have
</p>
<p>all these papers this afternoon, because I want to give the
</p>
<p>originals to the Minister of War and the copies to parle-
</p>
<p>mentarians.' J
</p>
<p>"After the papers were copied, what did you do ?"
</p>
<p>"I took them to Almereyda immediately."
</p>
<p>"But, is it not a fact that the next day, or the day after,
</p>
<p>you went with Almereyda to Spain?"
</p>
<p>"It is possible that I took a trip the next day. You see,
</p>
<p>Almereyda said to me one day, that at the end of June or
</p>
<p>the beginning of July, 1916, the horse races begin at San
</p>
<p>Sebastian. Almereyda had an idea of starting a sporting
</p>
<p>paper in Spain. He said, 'I do not know if I will do it, but
</p>
<p>if you will come with me, and I decide to do it, you will have
</p>
<p>the administrative work of it, the buying of the paper and
</p>
<p>handling the printing of it.'
</p>
<p>"I ought to say that Almereyda told me to get a letter of
</p>
<p>recommendation to M. Merquet, the lessee of the Casino at
</p>
<p>San Sebastan, and also proprietor of the race track. Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda also spoke of a letter to M. Harmes or Hermes, who
</p>
<p>was, I believe, the French consul at San Sebastian. We
</p>
<p>arrived at San Sebastian on a Monday or a Tuesday about
</p>
<p>noon. We at once tried to see M. Marquet, but learned that
</p>
<p>he was in Madrid. So we returned to Paris."
</p>
<p>Such was the story told by Marion, when finally caught in
</p>
<p>the trap. But during the two years immediately following
</p>
<p>this amazing performance, although he had made copies of
</p>
<p>the war secrets of France, for which Germany would have
</p>
<p>paid millions, and turned them over to the criminal associate
</p>
<p>of Malvy and Caillaux, Marion continued to walk the streets
</p>
<p>of Paris, and to travel about France on various other secret
</p>
<p>missions without the slightest molestation.

</p>
<p>on this trip than San Sebastian, Almereyda was found to
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>have continued as far as Carthegena, where a German U-boat
</p>
<p>had just arrived. Many months later secret agents of the
</p>
<p>Allies in Switzerland and other neutral countries, who were
</p>
<p>shadowing Germany's agents and in many instances working
</p>
<p>with them under various disguises, reported that Berlin had
</p>
<p>learned everything about the French army at Salonika.
</p>
<p>They said that when Roumania entered the war on August
</p>
<p>27, 1916, the German General Staff mapped out a counter
</p>
<p>campaign, which was based in part upon the very documents,
</p>
<p>which were stolen by the Bonnet Rouge gang.
</p>
<p>From the official records of the Third Counsel of War in
</p>
<p>Paris, it can now be stated that these documents contained
</p>
<p>the following information concerning General Sarrail's
</p>
<p>army:
</p>
<p>"Great scarcity of effectives.
</p>
<p>"Lack of training and coordination.
</p>
<p>"Insufficient provisions and equipment.
</p>
<p>"Inability to continue a campaign far from the sea coast.
</p>
<p>"Inability to do more than hold Bulgaria."
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the German war preparations against Rou-
</p>
<p>mania practically ignored Allied assistance. What happened
</p>
<p>to this unfortunate country is well told in the following pas-
</p>
<p>sages from Marsh's "History of the World War":
</p>
<p>"And the worst fell upon hapless Roumania. A vast force
</p>
<p>of military engineers moving like a human screen in front
</p>
<p>of von Mackensen's army followed routes carefully mapped
</p>
<p>out by German spies during the period of Roumania's neu-
</p>
<p>trality. Military bridges, measured to the inch, had been
</p>
<p>prepared to carry cannon, material and men over streams
</p>
<p>and ravines. Every Roumanian oil well, mine and store
</p>
<p>house had been located and mapped. German scientists had
</p>
<p>studied Roumanian weather conditions and von Mackensen
</p>
<p>attacked while the roads were at their best and the weather
</p>
<p>most favorable.

<p>"As the Germans swept forward, spies met them and gave
</p>
<p>154 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>them military information of the utmost value. A swarm of
</p>
<p>airplanes reported the movements of the Roumanians and
</p>
<p>no Roumanian airplanes rose to meet them.
</p>
<p>"General von Falkenhayn, cooperating with von Macken-
</p>
<p>sen, smashed his way through Vulkan pass, and cut the main
</p>
<p>line running to Bucharest at Craiova. The Dobrudja
</p>
<p>region was overrun and the central Rumanian plain was
</p>
<p>swept clear of all Roumanian opposition to the German
</p>
<p>advance. The seat of government was transferred from
</p>
<p>Bucharest to Jassy on November 28, 1916, and on December
</p>
<p>6. Bucharest was 'entered by von Mackensen, definitely put-
</p>
<p>ting an end to Roumania, as a factor in the war.
</p>
<p>"The immediate result of the fall of Roumania was to
</p>
<p>release immense stores of petroleum for German use. British
</p>
<p>and Roumanian engineers had done their utmost by the use
</p>
<p>of explosives to make useless the great Roumanian oil wells,
</p>
<p>but German engineers soon had the precious fluid in full
</p>
<p>flow. This furnished the fuel which Germany had long and
</p>
<p>ardently desired.
</p>
<p>"The oil burning submarine now came into its own. It
</p>
<p>was possible to plan a great fleet of submersibles to attempt
</p>
<p>execution of von Tirpitz's plan for unrestricted submarine
</p>
<p>warfare. This was decided upon by the German High Com-
</p>
<p>mand the day Bucharest fell. It was realized that such a
</p>
<p>policy would bring the United States into the war, but the
</p>
<p>Kaiser and his advisers hoped the submarine and a great
</p>

<p>In Lt. Mornet's indictment of Marion following his arrest
</p>
<p>in 1918, which will be dealt with in detail in Chapter XIX,
</p>
<p>and which is now on file among the other papers of the Third
</p>
<p>Council of War, there may be found the following passages :
</p>
<p>"Marion had his typist make four copies of these docu-
</p>
<p>ments just before he was about to make a trip to Spain. Of

</p>
<p>course there is no proof that Marion communicated these
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 155
</p>
<p>documents to the enemy. But, it Is a fact that one month or
</p>
<p>six weeks before unfortunate Roumania's entry into the war,
</p>
<p>some information of this character was furnished the Bul-
</p>
<p>garian army. We were, at that time, utterly unable to do
</p>
<p>anything to help our ally."
</p>
<p>Duval was in Switzerland on July 8, and it has been
</p>
<p>alleged that he turned over another copy of these documents
</p>
<p>to Marx. In a deposition before Captain Bouchardon, Leon
</p>
<p>Daudet said:
</p>
<p>"Secret documents concerning the armies of the Orient
</p>
<p>were passed by M. Malvy to M. Leymarie, and from the
</p>
<p>latter to M. Paix-Seailks, who passed them to Almereyda.
</p>
<p>These papers gave the reasons why an offensive by the
</p>
<p>Allied armies at Salonika was at that time impossible. Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda acted immediately and he communicated the informa-
</p>
<p>tion through Duval to Marx of Mannheim, who sent it to
</p>
<p>Berlin, which transmitted it to the Bulgarians, who without
</p>
<p>fear of being attacked by General Sarrail pounced down
</p>
<p>upon the Roumanians. The sad result we all know."
</p>
<p>The entire plot of giving Germany the Salonika army
</p>
<p>secrets might have been fully uncovered in 1916, had it not
</p>
<p>been for Malvy. Here again we find the chief lieutenant of
</p>
<p>Caillaux standing like a shield in front of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>with the result that they continued to use every possible
</p>
<p>means to weaken France and aid the enemy.
</p>
<p>The frequent trips of the Bonnet Rouge gang to other
</p>
<p>countries together with stories that it was in communication
</p>
<p>with the foe were brought to the atteniton of Premier Briand
</p>
<p>early in 1916. M. Briand was too busy to make an investi-
</p>
<p>gation himself, and accordingly he delegated the task to
</p>
<p>Malvy. Here is Premier Briand's statement:
</p>
<p>"At the beginning of 1916 I discovered a positive change
</p>
<p>in the orientation of the Bonnet Rouge. I at once sent for
</p>
<p>M. Malvy and said, 'I do not know the relations which the

</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior may have with the Bonnet Rouge,
</p>
<p>156 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>but I give you a warning, that if it persists in continuing as
</p>
<p>at present, I shall take it under surveillance and treat it
</p>
<p>with severity. The censorship has strict orders. It will be
</p>
<p>watched, suspended and probably suppressed, if it does not
</p>
<p>change its attitude."
</p>
<p>Malvy said that he would look into the matter at once.
</p>
<p>He said later that he stopped the government subsidy of the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge in February, 1916. But that was only a few
</p>
<p>weeks before the German gold began to flow into the news-
</p>
<p>paper through Marx and Duval.
</p>
<p>In June, 1916, about the time that Almereyda and Marion
</p>
<p>made copies of General Sarrail's papers and took a trip to
</p>
<p>Spain, Premier Briand again became suspicious. He had
</p>
<p>learned that Almereyda was in Carthegena and Bilboa at a
</p>
<p>time when a German U-boat was lying off the Spanish shore.
</p>
<p>Again he called in Malvy and asked for an explanation.
</p>
<p>Malvy promised a most searching inquiry. Concerning this
</p>
<p>incident Premier Briand was questioned two years later, and
</p>
<p>he replied:
</p>
<p>"I invited the Minister of the Interior to watch the people
</p>
<p>connected with the paper and particularly the trips, they
</p>
<p>made abroad. I think I even gave M. Laurent (Prefect of
</p>
<p>Police in Paris) strict instructions that no passports be
</p>
<p>given except for good reasons."
</p>
<p>As the issuance of all passports came immediately within
</p>
<p>the control of Malvy, he could have put an instant stop to
</p>
<p>the various lines of communication which the Bonnet Rouge
</p>
<p>had established with the enemy, had he so desired.
</p>
<p>No person can leave France without making application
</p>
<p>to the prefect of the district. All the prefects are under
</p>
<p>the immediate jurisdiction of the Minister of the Interior.
</p>
<p>Again Malvy promised Briand he would make the most
</p>
<p>searching investigation of the Bonnet Rouge, of Almereyda,
</p>
<p>of Duval and all the rest. And what happened?

</p>
<p>M. Dumas, Chief of the General Information Bureau of
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 157
</p>
<p>the Prefecture of Police, was told to investigate Almereyda.
</p>
<p>M. Dumas was the kind of a subordinate, whose conscien-
</p>
<p>ciousness and thoroughness sometimes get superiors into
</p>
<p>trouble. M. Dumas became greatly interested in Almereyda's
</p>
<p>career. The more he digged into the Apache's life, the more
</p>
<p>he delighted in digging still deeper. After a great deal of
</p>
<p>labor, M. Dumas rendered the following report to the Min-
</p>
<p>ister of the Interior:
</p>
<p>"Vigo or Almereyda was born in Beziers, on January 5,
</p>
<p>18C3, and came to Paris in 1899. He soon became a thief.
</p>
<p>Finally, he was caught in a robbery, and sent to prison. He
</p>
<p>left prison at the age of 18 an anarchist."
</p>
<p>The crimes of Almereyda from that time on which were
</p>
<p>enumerated by Dumas, constitute much the same list, as was
</p>
<p>mentioned in Chapter II. The investigator then continued:
</p>
<p>"Almereyda became a photographer, but he soon quit that
</p>
<p>business. He devoted himself wholly to revolutionary propa-
</p>
<p>ganda. He became secretary of the editorial staff of
</p>
<p>Libert aire. He was delegate in 1904 to the anarchist con-
</p>
<p>gress in Amsterdam, and one of the signers of the famous
</p>
<p>antimilitaristic poster, entitled, 'To the Soldiers,' which also
</p>
<p>had the signature of Gustave Herve. With Herve he founded
</p>
<p>Guerre Saddle (Social War), of which until 1913 he was
</p>
<p>the secretary of the editorial staff.
</p>
<p>"During the legislative elections of 1910, he founded a
</p>
<p>the rabid Groupe Antiparlementaire (Antiparlementarian
</p>
<p>Group) and became very active in the XVIIIth arrondisse-
</p>
<p>ment. He created the 'Association of the Young Revolu-
</p>
<p>tionary Guards' for the purpose of breaking up the meetings
</p>
<p>of rivals.
</p>
<p>"In 1912 he gave his support to the Unified Socialist
</p>
<p>Party, and the following year he left Guerre Soc'nale to
</p>
<p>enter the Courrier Europcen (European Courier) of Paix-

</p>
<p>Seailles, (who later gave him the army secrets of General
</p>
<p>158 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>Sarrail) and finally on November 23, 1913, he founded the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge, thanks to the financial help of M. Caillaux.
</p>
<p>"Here is to be found the second political evolution of
</p>
<p>Almereyda, who became a Radical Socialist (the same as
</p>
<p>Caillaux), as director of the Bonnet Rouge. This change of
</p>
<p>opinion had its effect even on the personality of Almereyda.
</p>
<p>Until then he was always hard up and seedy looking. He
</p>
<p>now became more elegant. He began to frequent the expen-
</p>
<p>sive establishments of the grand boulevards, where he entered
</p>
<p>into relations with shady financiers, journalists lying in wait
</p>
<p>for scandals, and certain individuals, who by various under-
</p>
<p>hand means establish connections between captains of high
</p>
<p>finance and politicians.
</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, until April, 1915, he maintained only a
</p>
<p>modest home, at a rental of only 500 francs.
</p>
<p>"However, by the end of June, 1915, he established himself
</p>
<p>in a furnished apartment at No. 51 Rue Spontini, at a
</p>
<p>monthly rental of 740 francs, where he lived for several
</p>
<p>months with two mistresses, one named Claro Emilie, the
</p>
<p>other, Berni Leonie, also known as Emilienne Brevannes, who
</p>
<p>was born in 1895 at Poissy. Although she had had relations
</p>
<p>with Almereyda since January, 1915, Emilienne Brevannes
</p>
<p>has kept her former apartment at No. 50 Rue Condorcet,
</p>
<p>at an annual rental of 500 francs.
</p>
<p>"Since the month of April, 1917, Almereyda has advertised
</p>
<p>his wealth in most insolent fashion. He installed Mile. Berni
</p>
<p>at No. 24 Boulevard des Capucines, in an apartment for
</p>
<p>which he pays 600 francs a month. He also leases a villa
</p>
<p>at No. 14 Rue Gustav Latour, St. Cloud, which costs him
</p>
<p>10,000 francs a year. He has also bought an estate at
</p>
<p>Juan les Pins, in the Maritime Alps.
</p>
<p>"He is buying all kinds of luxuries. For example on one
</p>
<p>occasion he bought some jewelry for the Berni girl, whioh
</p>
<p>cost 50,000 francs.

</p>
<p>"Some attribute his sudden fortune to the largesses of
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 159
</p>
<p>political friends, of financiers, of war contractors, who might
</p>
<p>have recourse under diverse covers to the services of Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda. Others call special attention to the evolution of the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge, which has changed its note and has joined the
</p>
<p>minority socialists, of the Kienthal shade, almost as much as
</p>
<p>letting it be known that the money, which he dispenses so
</p>
<p>extravagantly, comes from Germany.
</p>
<p>"It is said in some newspaper offices that Almereyda may
</p>
<p>have received large commissions by acting as an intermediary
</p>
<p>between the sub-secretary of munitions and M. Raffalovitch,
</p>
<p>secretary general of the Bank of Commerce of Petrograd,
</p>
<p>who has charge of military supplies."
</p>
<p>The report of M. Dumas spoke also of Almereyda's asso-
</p>
<p>ciates, Goldsky, Marion, Jacques Lathuille, who peddled
</p>
<p>betting tips at the race track, and who in 1904 became editor
</p>
<p>of the Radical, from which he was afterward discharged ;
</p>
<p>Alexandre Raffalovitch, Rabbat, a convicted swindler, who
</p>
<p>has been associated with the famous Zucco in various enter-
</p>
<p>prises ; Napoleon Poggiale, lessee of a gambling house many
</p>
<p>times condemned for violating Article 210 of the Penal Code;
</p>
<p>Bontempi, called Bontemps, former editor of Libertaire, and
</p>
<p>four times convicted; Sophie Franckel, a woman, who had a
</p>
<p>house of ill repute at No. 17 Rue de Hamburg, and Mme.
</p>
<p>Stourmier, a mid-wife, who sold narcotics. Dumas also said:
</p>
<p>"Almereyda tried to induce men of standing to carry let-
</p>
<p>ters which the pacifists did not wish to trust to the mails.
</p>
<p>Almereyda undertook to furnish them with the necessary
</p>
<p>papers and passports.
</p>
<p>"Among the persons supposed to have accomplished a
</p>
<p>mission of this sort was Henri Guilbeaux. He is said to have
</p>
<p>come to Paris twice with papers. This same man facilitated
</p>
<p>the escape of Gilbert, the aviator, when he made two visits
</p>
<p>to Switzerland.
</p>
<p>"By an indirect route, but quite a sure one, it is further

<p>known that Marion, the administrator of the Bonnet Rouge,
</p>
<p>160 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>went to Detroit, U. S., to obtain the financial assistance of
</p>
<p>M. Ford, M. Archdeacon and other persons, more or less
</p>
<p>interested in the international movement for peace.
</p>
<p>(E. G. Liebold, secretary of Henry Ford, in reply to an
</p>
<p>inquiry regarding Marion's trip said: "Mr. Ford does not
</p>
<p>recall ever having met the parties mentioned and we assume
</p>
<p>therefore their intended mission was not carried out.")
</p>
<p>"Towards the 15th of June, Almereyda's valet, called
</p>
<p>Rafael, received a telegram from Spain, calling him to the
</p>
<p>bedside of his father. Two days later, Almereyda, who was
</p>
<p>preparing to join his mistress, who was spending her season
</p>
<p>at Dole, at the home of the under-prefect of the town, re-
</p>
<p>ceived a telegram from Spain also. He immediately asked
</p>
<p>for a passport, which he obtained on June 20, 1916. Its
</p>
<p>number was 11704. According to his friends, Almereyda
</p>
<p>went to Carthegena with a Harry Thomas.
</p>
<p>"On June 21, the day after Almereyda left Paris, the Ger-
</p>
<p>man submarine, U 35, entered the port of Carthegena for a
</p>
<p>sojourn and the director of the Bonnet Rouge is reported to
</p>
<p>have remained near."
</p>
<p>And what did Malvy do with this report? The answer
</p>
<p>may be found in the following statement of Dumas, which
</p>
<p>later became a court record :
</p>
<p>"On September 7, 1916, I was called to the office of the
</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior, and received by M. Malvy. He
</p>
<p>said: *I have just read your report. There is nothing very
</p>
<p>much in it, nothing very much. I have just seen Almereyda.
</p>
<p>I have just seen the poor fellow. He came to my house,
</p>
<p>suffering, ill. I asked him some clever questions. He pro-
</p>
<p>tested vigorously. He denied absolutely that his money came
</p>
<p>from such sources, as reported.'
</p>
<p>"I was quite excited. I said to M. Malvy: 'Have you
</p>
<p>communicated my report to Almereyda? Have you told
</p>
<p>everything to him, Mr. Minister?'

<p>" 'No, I just asked some cunning questions,* replied M.
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 161
</p>
<p>Malvy. 'There are a lot of things to be verified, you know.
</p>
<p>As it is, your report does not prove much to me. To my
</p>
<p>questions Almereyda offered explanations. He said for in-
</p>
<p>stance that the automobiles, which he was driving, came from
</p>
<p>a garage, which he owned in the Boulevard Pereire, and that
</p>
<p>the money of which you speak had been furnished him by
</p>
<p>M. Boulet, a wine merchant, to indemnify him for a cam-
</p>
<p>paign in behalf of the wine trade. He said he had also re-
</p>
<p>ceived from M. Francfort 50,000 francs (excuse its being so
</p>
<p>little). He said he had secured an important order for M.
</p>
<p>Francfort from the Ministry of Munitions. No, there is
</p>
<p>nothing in your report of any consequence.' '
</p>
<p>Dumas nevertheless made a second report on September
</p>
<p>18, of which he said :
</p>
<p>"My assertions were verified and proved absolutely cor-
</p>
<p>rect. My second report confirmed my first report. I pre-
</p>
<p>sented it to the office of the Prefect of Police, who doubtless
</p>
<p>transmitted it to M. Malvy. I never heard any more
</p>
<p>about it."
</p>
<p>Poor Dumas.
</p>
<p>His work was all for nought. Both his reports were

</p>
<p>MME. POZZOLI'S TELL TALE DIARY
</p>
<p>Reveals Caillau&'s Conferences with Cavallini, Enemy Agent
</p>
<p>and Briber The Luncheon at Lame's CaiLlaux's Italian
</p>
<p>Journey His Plans of a Latin Alliance His Gospel of
</p>
<p>Dispair and Defeat Yagghen, Another Oriental Pacifier
</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1916, Caillaux thought he saw another
</p>
<p>opportunity to ascend to power. He believed that the
</p>
<p>Briand ministry was tottering. He thought he could stir
</p>
<p>up in Italy enough hatred toward England to create the
</p>
<p>Latin Alliance of which he had dreamed so long, an alliance
</p>
<p>that would later include Spain, and merge its interests with
</p>
<p>those of the Central Powers. This plan of course would re-
</p>
<p>sult in throwing upon the British Empire the whole brunt of
</p>
<p>the war.
</p>
<p>In October, 1916, Caillaux went to Italy and met his wife
</p>
<p>at Monti Cafini. From there they went to Florence and
</p>
<p>thence to Rome. Leaving his wife in Rome, he returned to
</p>
<p>Paris.
</p>
<p>And now who should enter the scene but Cavallini, the
</p>
<p>Italian associate of ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmi; Cavallini, the
</p>
<p>agent of Germany; Cavallini, who carried 1,000,000 francs
</p>
<p>of German bribe money to Bolo's Paris home. Behind Caval-
</p>
<p>lini in this ijew plot was not only Abbas Hilmi but another
</p>
<p>oriental traitor, Yagghen Pacha, a cousin of the Khedive.
</p>
<p>Yagghen had married a Mme. Lussato, an Italian lady, and
</p>
<p>had made his home in Italy. Proof was later obtained by the
</p>
<p>Italian authorities, that Yagghen had spent about 1,000,000

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 163
</p>
<p>francs in efforts to bribe Italian statesmen and the Italian
</p>
<p>press to advocate an immediate peace.
</p>
<p>It was this same propaganda among the Italian troops
</p>
<p>which resulted in the Caporetto disaster in October, 1917,
</p>
<p>when the Italian line was broken by a great Austrian-German
</p>
<p>attack and thrown back toward the Piave.
</p>
<p>On October 2, 1916, Cavallini and a woman, named Mme.
</p>
<p>Pozzoli, came to Paris and established themselves in a sump-
</p>
<p>tuously furnished apartment. As it later developed, much to
</p>
<p>the mortification of all concerned, Mme. Pozzoli kept a diary.
</p>
<p>Within its little pages she loved to record all the petty hap-
</p>
<p>penings of the day, the dates of tea parties, the names of
</p>
<p>guests, how they looked, what they said. Now and then
</p>
<p>she used abbreviations and various cryptic phrases, as if she
</p>
<p>did not dare trust everything to paper.
</p>
<p>Cavallini and Mme. Pozzoli remained in Paris until No-
</p>
<p>vember 22, 1916, and during that time the Italian visitor
</p>
<p>gave several dinners and luncheons, which might easily have
</p>
<p>convinced those of his guests who did not know his real mis-
</p>
<p>sion, that he was the great financier, which he publicly pre-
</p>
<p>tended to be.
</p>
<p>At one of these luncheons Cavallini met Caillaux. The
</p>
<p>guests were brought together in a private chamber in the
</p>
<p>famous Restaurant Larue in the Place de la Madeleine. Ac-
</p>
<p>cording to a speech which Caillaux made more than a year
</p>
<p>later, on Dec. 22, 1917, in the Chamber of Deputies, Caval-
</p>
<p>lini was introduced to him at Larue's by Loustalot, a fellow
</p>
<p>deputy. Caillaux's eleventh hour explanation was as follows :
</p>
<p>"One day I met my old collague, Loustalot, in the Chamber
</p>
<p>of Deputies. He said he wanted me to take dejeuner with him
</p>
<p>and meet an Italian, who desired to talk banking. 'Very
</p>
<p>well,' I said, 1 will be glad to see him, although I am not a
</p>
<p>banker.'
</p>
<p>"I went with M. Loustalot. I met M. Cavallini and sev-

</p>
<p>eral others. We all had dejeuner together. Our conversa-
</p>
<p>164 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>tion was most desultory. We discussed politics for a while.
</p>
<p>The early accession of the Orlando ministry was predicted.
</p>
<p>There was talk of founding a newspaper in Rome, to be
</p>
<p>called the Paris-Rome, and I declared the scheme to be
</p>
<p>chimerical. Finally, I was consulted about the bank. They
</p>
<p>told me that the best names would be found in the board of
</p>
<p>directors and that M. Salandra, former Premier of Italy,
</p>
<p>would head the list.
</p>
<p>"I replied, 'Boards of Directors sound well, but what is
</p>
<p>wanted for a bank is business. Have you any customers, and
</p>
<p>who are they?' Some names were mentioned the Genoa
</p>
<p>Tramways and the Anvaldo Company, both well known, and
</p>
<p>the Roman R. R. which is less known.
</p>
<p>"I left the restaurant with the impression that I had been
</p>
<p>lunching with a particularly interesting man. A few days
</p>
<p>later, Loustalot came to me again and said:
</p>
<p>" 'M. Cavallini is returning to Rome, where your wife is.
</p>
<p>Do you wish to give him a note to her?' I answered:
</p>
<p>" 'No, I will write my wife that M. Cavallini will call to
</p>
<p>see her. She will receive him, if she thinks it advisable to
</p>
<p>do so. But I promise nothing, because she wishes to preserve
</p>
<p>the strictest incognito.
</p>
<p>"I wrote Mme. Caillaux, as follows: 'Here is a person
</p>
<p>introduced to me by my friend Loustalot, in whom I have the
</p>
<p>fullest confidence. I have no further information about him.
</p>
<p>If you can get any, do so. At any rate do not receive him,
</p>
<p>if you have any objection.' '
</p>
<p>Whether or not Caillaux and Cavallini talked about bank-
</p>
<p>ing or a separate peace, they established a relationship at the
</p>
<p>Larue luncheon, which soon became exceedingly intimate.
</p>
<p>The diary of Mme. Pozzoli, which the Italian police seized
</p>
<p>many months later, showed that she and Cavallini went to
</p>
<p>visit Mme. Caillaux, as soon as they reached the Italian
</p>
<p>capital, and that Mme. Caillaux accepted their friendship.

<p>Nearly every day Mme. Caillaux called upon Cavallini and

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 165
</p>
<p>Mme. Pozzoli or they visited her. Finally, when M. Caillaux,
</p>
<p>himself, arrived in Rome, Cavallini and the Pozzoli woman
</p>
<p>gave M. and Mme. Caillaux a special reception. The story
</p>
<p>is told in Mme. Pozzoli's diary, as follows:
</p>
<p>"December 2, ... Philippe (Cavallini) returns "
</p>
<p>"December 3, ... after luncheon, visit to Mme. C's."
</p>
<p>(Mme. Caillaux.)
</p>
<p>"December 4, ... invitation to dinner from Henriette
</p>
<p>C." (Mme. Caillaux's maiden name was Henriette Ray-
</p>
<p>nouard.)
</p>
<p>"December 7, ... gave dinner to Mme. C., where are
</p>
<p>present also the Prince Sciarra, Ricardi and others."
</p>
<p>"December 9, ... we all go to see the film, Christus. . . ."
</p>
<p>"December 11, ... arrival and reception for M. Caillaux."
</p>
<p>"December 13, .. .promenade at Frascati with the Cail-
</p>
<p>laux couple. . . ."
</p>
<p>"December 15, . . . dinner to the Caillaux couple. . . ."
</p>
<p>"December 17 Luncheon at Castello di Cesari with Cail-
</p>
<p>laux and Riccardi . . . . "
</p>
<p>"December 18, . . . departure of M. Caillaux for Naples."
</p>
<p>Between December 18, 1916, and January 5, 1917, Cail-
</p>
<p>laux was in Naples and elsewhere in Italy pleading with
</p>
<p>various Italian statesmen and financiers to work for an im-
</p>
<p>mediate peace. Meantime Cavallini confered with Loustalot,
</p>
<p>Abbas Hilmi and Yagghen Pacha in various places of ren-
</p>
<p>dezvous. After this interval, Mme. Pozzoli's diary con-
</p>
<p>tinues :

<p>January 5, 1917, Caillaux arrived in Rome 2 p. m. Wife

</p>
<p>166 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>January 7, Caillaux couple have dinner at San Carlo with
</p>
<p>Mme. Pczzoli. At 10 p. m. Caillaux left Rome for Paris.
</p>
<p>Mme. Caillaux remained behind in Italy until February 4.
</p>
<p>She continued to live at the Hotel de Russie, where Mme.
</p>
<p>Pozzoli was also to be seen almost daily, going and coming
</p>
<p>from the Caillaux apartments.
</p>
<p>Caillaux had made this propagandist trip to Italy, with
</p>
<p>such secrecy that even his most intimate friends in Paris
</p>
<p>knew nothing of it. His passport had been made out in the
</p>
<p>name of Joseph Raynouard.
</p>
<p>Having arrived in Rome and established connections with
</p>
<p>Cavallini, Bolo's paymaster, Caillaux began the most vigor-
</p>
<p>ous campaign for a separate peace between Italy and France
</p>
<p>on the one hand and Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and Tur-
</p>
<p>key on the other. In this connection it should be remem-
</p>
<p>bered that Italy did not formally declare war on Germany
</p>
<p>until August 28, 1916, or only four months before Caillaux's
</p>
<p>visit.
</p>
<p>Caillaux talked with as many of the most influential Italian
</p>
<p>statesmen, as he thought he could convert, and said that
</p>
<p>France was almost bled to death, that Germany could not be
</p>
<p>conquered, that the only salvation for either France or Italy
</p>
<p>was peace.
</p>
<p>Proof that Caillaux's Italian trip was one of his most dar-
</p>
<p>ing 'efforts to disrupt the Entente has been obtained from
</p>
<p>Signor Ferdinando Martini, formerly A minister (in the
</p>
<p>cabinet of Salandra, who had a long interview with Caillaux.
</p>
<p>In a sworn statement, which he made at the treason trial of
</p>
<p>Cavallini in Rome, Martini completely unmasked Caillaux.
</p>
<p>An English translation of Signor Martini's deposition made
</p>
<p>by Walter Littlefield of the New York Times with various
</p>
<p>bracketed notes by Mr. Littlefield, that are especially illu-
</p>
<p>minating and instructive, reads as follows :

<p>"Dec. 17, 1916. I have just left Caillaux after my inter-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 167
</p>
<p>view and I would not miss a moment before setting it down.
</p>
<p>The subject first taken was, quite naturally, the overture
</p>
<p>from Germany. [Note from Germany and her allies dated
</p>
<p>Dec. 12 offering to enter peace negotiations.] We agreed
</p>
<p>that to nd the matter by refusing to negotiate would con-
</p>
<p>stitute a rather serious political blunder if any reply were
</p>
<p>made at all.
</p>
<p>"He [Caillaux] expressed himself as believing that the
</p>
<p>moment for peace had not yet arrived, and that a final effort
</p>
<p>would be made in the Spring [Nivelle's offensive in Cham-
</p>
<p>pagne], but that it would be to indulge in the most fatal
</p>
<p>illusions to imagine that the war could last until the Autumn
</p>
<p>of next year.
</p>
<p>"France [Caillaux said] had already lost 1,500,000 men
</p>
<p>1,100,000 dead and 400,000 mutilated or so seriously
</p>
<p>wounded as to be incapable of following any profession or
</p>
<p>trade whatever. Nobody, broadly speaking, believed that
</p>
<p>the Germans could be driven out of the ten departments
</p>
<p>they occupied; the resources in men remaining to France
</p>
<p>were the 1917 class, numbering 200,000 men, and the 1918
</p>
<p>class, making 150,000 men more. They would only suffice
</p>
<p>to fill up the gaps caused by losses, and France, therefore,
</p>
<p>could put on the front not more than 2,500,000 men, possibly
</p>
<p>not so many.
</p>
<p>"The spirit of the public was depressed, (deprime) and the
</p>
<p>former enthusiasm among the soldiers was dead. He had
</p>
<p>received letters from soldiers whose homes were in his own
</p>
<p>constituency which left no doubt as to the state of mind of
</p>
<p>the troops, and those letters, like those received by others,
</p>
<p>ended with 'Down with the war !' and even 'Long live Brizon 1'
</p>
<p>[Brizon was a Deputy who had been expelled from the Cham-
</p>
<p>ber for expressing defeatist sentiments.]
</p>
<p>"He [Caillaux] said he knew Italy, and knew that the
</p>
<p>state of public feeling here was not very different from that

<p>in France, although it was perhaps different among the sol-
</p>
<p>168 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>diers, because Italy had been a year less in the war than
</p>
<p>France.
</p>
<p>"I informed Caillaux that it had been reported that Ger-
</p>
<p>many was inclined to make concessions to the noninsular
</p>
<p>Western powers France and Italy and that there were
</p>
<p>even persons who asserted that the crisis then existing in
</p>
<p>the Austrian Government was due to this fact, as Korber
</p>
<p>[Dr. von Korber, Austrian Premier, who that very day
</p>
<p>Dec. 17, 1916 had been succeeded by Herr von Spitz-
</p>
<p>muller] had resigned because he would not assume the respon-
</p>
<p>ibility for the territorial concessions to be made to Italy.
</p>
<p>"Caillaux knew nothing of these reports, but thought he
</p>
<p>ought to take them into consideration, and he asserted that
</p>
<p>he also believed that both Germany and Austria, the latter
</p>
<p>being entirely dominated by the former, were disposed to
</p>
<p>make concessions to Italy and France. As to France, he said
</p>
<p>he believed that peace could be made on very simple condi-
</p>
<p>tions namely, the evacuation of the occupied departments
</p>
<p>and the cession of a part of Lorraine, and perhaps even
</p>
<p>without the latter.
</p>
<p>" 'And do you not fear,' I asked, 'that they will ask you
</p>
<p>to surrender Morocco?'
</p>
<p>" 'We could not give it up at any price,' he responded.
</p>
<p>'We could not have Germany in a position to stab us in the
</p>
<p>back. Germany understands this and will not press her de-
</p>
<p>mands so far as that. She is not in a very good position
</p>
<p>herself, and her proposals are certainly owing to her own
</p>
<p>condition and the famine which threatens her.'
</p>
<p>" 'But do you really think that France would make peace
</p>
<p>under the conditions you mention?'
</p>
<p>"She could not [said Caillaux] do anything else. Our
</p>
<p>output of munitions has gone down through lack of raw ma-
</p>
<p>terials. And there are two facts of special importance con-
</p>
<p>cerning which you are in ignorance Algeria is teeming with

<p>revolution and so is Senegal. The Prefect of (Caillaux
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 169
</p>
<p>mentioned the name of the place, but I have forgotten it) has
</p>
<p>been murdered. A detachment of soldiers sent to put down
</p>
<p>the revolt has been surrounded and massacred. All this be-
</p>
<p>cause we committed the monstrous blunder of imposing con-
</p>
<p>scription on the Arabs.
</p>
<p>"Add to this the work of the Socialists, less important
</p>
<p>than in Italy, but still, effective, and the hatred of the peas-
</p>
<p>ants for the war.
</p>
<p>'I repeat [said Caillaux] that we cannot do anything more,
</p>
<p>and that peace which would be premature today will in-
</p>
<p>evitably be necessary in the Autumn. To this must be joined
</p>
<p>the fact that in the Autumn, owing to the losses which the
</p>
<p>Spring will cost us, we risk having in France a British army
</p>
<p>numerically superior to our own, and that we can not and
</p>
<p>do not want.
</p>
<p>"For many other reasons Caillaux saw an obvious necessity
</p>
<p>that France and Italy must be united by indissoluble bonds
</p>
<p>of sincere friendship and unshakable solidarity, both now and
</p>
<p>after the war, and he urged that it was desirable to bring
</p>
<p>Spain into the Latin League.
</p>
<p>" 'Spain is pro-German,' I remarked. 'The King of Spain
</p>
<p>has stated: "Those favorable to the Entente in Spain com-
</p>
<p>prise only myself and the rabble."
</p>
<p>" 'I have it,' Caillaux replied. 'I have expressed one wish :
</p>
<p>The all-important thing is a close and loyal union of our
</p>
<p>two countries. We shall easily come to an agreement, even
</p>
<p>in regard to customs questions. We produce commodities
</p>
<p>that Italy does not, and Italy produces commodities that we
</p>
<p>do not. There are only two real questions, two common
</p>
<p>products silk and wine. These dre not insoluble problems
</p>
<p>when paramount interests demand their solution.'
</p>
<p>" 'That is all very well,' I rejoined, 'but let us come back
</p>
<p>to the question of peace. What about England? We are
</p>
<p>bound to England by the Pact of London.' [The Treaty of

</p>
<p>and Russia, according to the terms of which Italy declared
</p>
<p>war on Austria-Hungary on the 23d of the following May.)
</p>
<p>"England, [said Caillaux,] when she has obtained the re-
</p>
<p>construction of Belgium, will accommodate herself to making
</p>
<p>peace. The submarines are destroying her merchant marine.
</p>
<p>Moreover, among the English people also there are many,
</p>
<p>even innumerable, opponents of the war. I do not overlook
</p>
<p>the fact, however, that if Germany demands the return of her
</p>
<p>colonies England neither would nor could consent."
</p>
<p>"'And Russia?'
</p>
<p>"Russia [said Caillaux] will have to pay. She has lost
</p>
<p>Poland. As to giving her Constantinople, would either you
</p>
<p>or ourselves agree to that? [This was before the Russian
</p>
<p>revolution, March 14, 1917, and the Bolshevist coup d'etat,
</p>
<p>Nov. 7, 1917.]
</p>
<p>" 'We have promised it to her.'
</p>
<p>"That promise is older than you think," said Caillaux.
</p>
<p>"It was made by M. Poincare when he went to Petrograd as
</p>
<p>Premier. He aimed at becoming President of the Republic,
</p>
<p>and, to insure his success, he wanted the votes of the Right
</p>
<p>in the Chamber. M. Isvolsky, the Russian Ambassador at
</p>
<p>Paris, had the power of securing these votes for him. I
</p>
<p>need not say anything more."
</p>
<p>[Note A highly placed French political personage, fully
</p>
<p>acquainted with all the negotiations before and during the
</p>
<p>war, has declared the statement in regard to President Poin-
</p>
<p>care to be groundless. The assertion had been spread broad-
</p>
<p>cast in the Chamber during the first years of the war. "It
</p>
<p>was the work of M. Caillaux," says Le Matin, "who carried
</p>
<p>on a systematic campaign against the President of the Re-
</p>
<p>public. M. Poincare never at any time promised Constanti-
</p>
<p>nople to Russia but supported a contrary policy when he

<p>of the two Chambers have long ago been well informed on the
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 171
</p>
<p>subject, and not one word of truth remained in this assertion
</p>
<p>of M. CaiUaux."]
</p>
<p>" 'Referring to M. Poincare,' I asked, "is it true that he
</p>
<p>is unpopular in France?' '
</p>
<p>"Unpopular?" [said Caillaux,] "Say, rather, detested."
</p>
<p>" 'And what do you forsee in regard to the Ministerial
</p>
<p>situation ?'
</p>
<p>"I foresee a coming crisis. Briand (then Premier) has lost
</p>
<p>all authority. He is not a man who looks far ahead. He
</p>
<p>looks for momentary, immediate successes and does not
</p>
<p>bother about anything else. It was he more than anybody
</p>
<p>who pushed Roumania into the conflict without taking into
</p>
<p>consideration the necessary help, in the absence of which it
</p>
<p>was easy to foresee all that has happened. This time also
</p>
<p>he has sought Parliamentary success without considering the
</p>
<p>consequences of his false and premature steps.
</p>
<p>"If Briand fails France has only three possible Premiers
</p>
<p>Clemenceau, Caillaux, and Barthou. Barthou is practically
</p>
<p>impossible, because he has thrown himself into the arms of the
</p>
<p>reactionary Clericals. During the first year of the war the
</p>
<p>Clericals appeared likely to enable Barthou to triumph. At
</p>
<p>the beginning of the present year these forces began to de-
</p>
<p>cline, and for some months have become very weak, and are
</p>
<p>now certainly impotent.
</p>
<p>"Not Barthou, therefore. For Caillaux the time is not yet
</p>
<p>come. There remains only Clemenceau." [Mr. Clemenceau
</p>
<p>became Premier Nov. 13, 1917.]
</p>
<p>" 'But is it possible to reconcile Clemenceau as Premier
</p>
<p>with Poincare as President of the Republic?'
</p>
<p>"That is precisely the question which must be asked, [said
</p>
<p>Caillaux.] If things turn out as appears likely, either Clem-
</p>
<p>enceau or Poincare will go. For this reason I doubt whether
</p>
<p>the next Ministry will be a Clemenceau Cabinet, and for want
</p>
<p>of anything better we shall have a Painleve Cabinet, [M.

<p>Painleve became Premier in September, Ribot having sue-

</p>
<p>ceeded M. Briand in the preceding March,] with a program
</p>
<p>of war to the death, which will make the great Spring offen-
</p>
<p>sive, after which will come the Ministry which will make the
</p>
<p>arrangement for peace.
</p>
<p>"As I remained silent for some minutes after this declara-
</p>
<p>tion, Caillaux asked me what I was thinking about.
</p>
<p>" 'About your certitude as to peace England Russia.'
</p>
<p>"I repeat, [said Caillaux.] England will consent. Lloyd
</p>
<p>George will make another great effort. Asquith is in reserve,
</p>
<p>watching events. As to Russia, she will turn herself toward
</p>
<p>Asia when she has conquered the revolution, which everybody,
</p>
<p>including the Russian Government, expects. In any case,
</p>
<p>nobody can be asked to do the impossible.
</p>
<p>"We are exhausted, and nobody can insist on our con-
</p>
<p>tinuing the struggle when we lack men and materials, and the
</p>
<p>only result will be useless massacres."
</p>
<p>Caillaux finally became so bold in his pacifist propaganda
</p>
<p>in Italy, that M. Camille Barrere, the French Ambassador at
</p>
<p>Rome, deemed it his duty to make a special report to the
</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs in Paris. Some of Caillaux's
</p>
<p>statements to the Italians were found to be so anti-English,
</p>
<p>so pro-German, so pregnant with defeatism of the most per-
</p>
<p>fidious sort, that the embassies of all the Allies at Rome were
</p>
<p>notified. As a result Italy was about to ask him to leave the
</p>
<p>country, when suddenly he learned that his operations had
</p>
<p>become known to the French government, and hurried home.
</p>
<p>After Caillaux was safely back in Paris, the French foreign
</p>
<p>office obtained fuller reports concerning Yagghen Pacha, the
</p>
<p>oriental associate of Cavallini. Yagghen had been arrested
</p>
<p>in Italy, but released because of protests that his territorial
</p>
<p>rights had been violated. Among the papers of Yagghen,
</p>
<p>was the copy of a letter to Cavillini, saying :
</p>
<p>"Briefly speaking, we must do here the work which

</p>
<p>had to be obtained someway. Not only were the expenses of

<p>business at the same time, Duval poured out a fresh glass of
</p>
<p>red wine, and said:
</p>
<p>"Vercasson, I wish you would go to Switzerland for me
</p>
<p>and get some money. I am too busy to go myself."

</p>
<p>The printer asked for more details, and Duval told him of
</p>
<p>the San Stefano Company and its liquidation. The money
</p>
<p>was to re-emburse French stock holders, he said.
</p>
<p>Although a law had been passed making it a crime for a
</p>
<p>Frenchman even to talk with a German regarding any kind
</p>
<p>of business, and everyone knew that the San Stefano had
</p>
<p>been controlled by German capitalists, Vercasson accepted the
</p>
<p>mission. He made four trips to Geneva, and brought back
</p>
<p>470,738 francs all told for the business manager of the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge.
</p>
<p>Just how Vercasson got the money in Geneva is still some-
</p>
<p>thing a mystery. There have been several explanations.
</p>
<p>Vercasson said in the witness chair many months later that
</p>
<p>he used to go to the International Hotel with a pass word for
</p>
<p>Mme. Amherd, the proprietress. Thereupon, he would re-
</p>
<p>ceive a package of franc notes, which we would deposit and
</p>
<p>for which he would obtain a check on a Paris bank.
</p>
<p>"I did not think there was anything wrong in what I did,"
</p>
<p>Vercasson said. "Let me tell you, for example, of my first
</p>
<p>trip. I reached Geneva on the evening of September 27,
</p>
<p>1916. I went to the Hotel International and asked for Mme.
</p>
<p>Amherd. Duval had told me that he himself always stopped
</p>
<p>at the Hotel International, and that frequently he had money
</p>
<p>in Mme. Amherd's keeping. I gave Mme. Amherd the pass-
</p>
<p>word, which Duval had given me, and she said:
</p>
<p>" 'Do you want the money now?'
</p>
<p>" 'Tomorrow morning will be better,' I replied. 'I can't
</p>
<p>deposit it in a bank tonight, and I do not care to keep a lot
</p>
<p>of money in my room.'
</p>
<p>"So in the morning, she landed me a package, containing
</p>
<p>35,000 francs. I gave her a receipt. Then I asked M.
</p>
<p>Bois, a friend of mine, to accompany me to a bank. I had
</p>
<p>no trouble. I obtained a check payable on the Credit du
</p>
<p>Nord, Avenue de 1'Opera, Paris. I cashed the check in Paris

</p>
<p>and then turned over the money in full to Duval. I made
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 175
</p>
<p>three other trips to Switzerland, and each time I brought
</p>
<p>back money to Duval in the same way. Altogether I got
</p>
<p>470,738 francs."
</p>
<p>The exact dates and the amounts of these checks, as
</p>
<p>learned by an investigation of bank books in France and
</p>
<p>Switzerland by the Clemenceau government, are as follows:
</p>
<p>September 29, 1916 35,000 francs
</p>
<p>November 8, 1916 80,000 francs
</p>
<p>November 10, 1916 19,000 francs
</p>
<p>December 23, 1916 171,757 francs
</p>
<p>February 17, 1917 164,981 francs
</p>
<p>470,738 francs
</p>
<p>Meantime the Bonnet Rouge was pushing the German
</p>
<p>defeatist propaganda with ever increasing vigor. It some-
</p>
<p>times ran afoul of the censor, but when it did Alemeryda
</p>
<p>would invoke the power of Malvy to intercede in his behalf.
</p>
<p>If necessary Malvy appealed even to the Premier, as shown
</p>
<p>in the following memorandum from the Ministry of the In-
</p>
<p>terior to the censor:
</p>
<p>June 10, 1916.
</p>
<p>The Cabinet of the Minister of the Interior, M. Truchon,
</p>
<p>Chief Assistant, brings to the attention of the officer on duty
</p>
<p>the information that the Minister of the Interior in accord
</p>
<p>with the President of the Council (Premier Briand) has de-
</p>
<p>cided to allow the Bonnet Rouge to re-appear today, upon
</p>
<p>the satisfactory assurances given by Almereyda.
</p>
<p>Countersigned
</p>
<p>MALVY.
</p>
<p>Around Almereyda, Duval and Marion there now revolved
</p>
<p>an ever increasing number of satillites, editors and reporters,
</p>
<p>who were willing, in return for more than ordinary salaries,
</p>
<p>to join in the nefarious propaganda, paid for by Marx.
</p>
<p>Chief among these lesser lights was Goldsky, whose real

</p>
<p>name was Goldschild, a bosom friend of Guilbeaux and
</p>
<p>176 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>d'Hartmas, lieutenants of Lenine. Goldsky was of the same
</p>
<p>Bolshevik type, as may be seen any evening on the East
</p>
<p>Side of New York, perched on a soap box and haranging the
</p>
<p>crowd on the iniquities of capitalism and the imperative need
</p>
<p>of a complete social cataclism, from which the proletariat will
</p>
<p>rise supreme.
</p>
<p>Goldsky, like Almereyda and Marion, had a criminal rec-
</p>
<p>ord. He had been twice condemned by the Court of Assizes
</p>
<p>of the Seine for inciting murder and military disobedience.
</p>
<p>And yet this man was made another connecting link be-
</p>
<p>tween the Bonnet Rouge and Malvy. Indeed, he was taken
</p>
<p>out of the army that he might obtain a position in Malvy's
</p>
<p>own office, and at the same time use a desk in the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge to write Bolshevik articles, signed, "General N." The
</p>
<p>steps by which this foe of France was able to crawl through
</p>
<p>the law, like a rat through cheese, furnish a still clearer
</p>
<p>illustration of the weakening and corrupting influences that
</p>
<p>reached through various departments of the government to
</p>
<p>the very cabinet of the Prime Minister.
</p>
<p>Goldsky belonged to the 1910 class which had been incor-
</p>
<p>porated into the 22nd Section of Military Nurses on August
</p>
<p>4, 1914. Later he had been attached to various units, as
</p>
<p>for example, "Sanitary Train, No. 14." For a time he was
</p>
<p>a division stretcher bearer. On October 27, 1915, he was
</p>
<p>sent back to his depot, and from January to July, 1916, he
</p>
<p>was a nurse in the hospital of the "Grand Palais."
</p>
<p>Because of some underground influence, Jean Leymarie,
</p>
<p>Malvy's chief assistant, wrote a letter in Malvy's name to the
</p>
<p>Minister of War, on July 9, 1916, asking that Goldsky be
</p>
<p>transferred to the Ministry of the Interior. As a result,
</p>
<p>Goldsky was placed in the 20th Section of the Secretaries of
</p>
<p>the Staff, and instructed to hold himself at Malvy's disposal.
</p>
<p>Everything seemed to have been nicely fixed, when on
</p>
<p>September 1, an order was suddenly issued shifting Goldsky

</p>
<p>back to the Ministry of War. The news caused special con-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 177
</p>
<p>sternation in the Bonnet Rouge office. Duval and Alme-
</p>
<p>reyda had a hurried conference, and Almereyda appealed to
</p>
<p>Malvy to bring Goldsky back. Almereyda's letter spoke of
</p>
<p>Goldsky, "as my most immediate collaborator, who has as-
</p>
<p>sumed, since his return from the front, the editorship of the
</p>
<p>Bonnet Rouge"
</p>
<p>Ministerial orders, such as sent Goldsky back to the Min-
</p>
<p>istry of War could be appealed to the "Bureau of Demurr-
</p>
<p>ers." Almereyda's petition in behalf of his Bolshevik colla-
</p>
<p>borator was turned over to this bureau. To the petition was
</p>
<p>pinned this note:
</p>
<p>"It is correct that demurrers have been granted in favor
</p>
<p>of newspapers. The last one, to my knowledge, was acceeded
</p>
<p>to upon the request of M. Charles Humbert, director of Le
</p>
<p>Journal in favor of M. Guerin."
</p>
<p>Below the note was written this notation :
</p>
<p>"No demurrer has been granted to editors, only to ordi-
</p>
<p>nary employees. It is not the same thing. In any case ask
</p>
<p>the Bureau of Demurrers."
</p>
<p>The bureau held an inquiry, at which it was reported that
</p>
<p>the Bonnet Rouge had grown from a weekly to a daily news-
</p>
<p>paper since the war, that it had a rapidly growing circula-
</p>
<p>tion, that its importance was constantly becoming greater,
</p>
<p>that its staff of editors had been increased, and that the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of M. Goldsky on its staff had been found most useful.
</p>
<p>The Bureau of Demurrers granted the favor, and Goldsky
</p>
<p>went back to the Ministry of the Interior. From that time
</p>
<p>on he spent part of the day under Malvy, as a government
</p>
<p>official, having access to the secret archives of the police and
</p>
<p>detective bureaus ; and during other hours he was counseling
</p>
<p>with Almereyda, Duval and Marion in schemes of perfidy
</p>
<p>and treason.
</p>
<p>Besides seeking to arouse class hatred in France, while
</p>
<p>always pointing to the panacea of a Bolskevik state, "Gen-

</p>
<p>eral N." devoted much of his time and energy also to a
</p>
<p>178 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>crusade against American intervention in the war. He
</p>
<p>argued that America's support of the Allies would prolong
</p>
<p>the conflict indefinitely, that the list of French dead and
</p>
<p>wounded would be interminably lengthened, that the Ger-
</p>
<p>mans could keep up the fight the same as ever, and that the
</p>
<p>only salvation for France was an immediate and separate
</p>
<p>peace.
</p>
<p>In the Bonnet Rouge of February 16 1917, thirteen days
</p>
<p>after the United States severed diplomatic relations with
</p>
<p>Germany, "General N." said that the Americans were going
</p>
<p>crazy. He congratulated the King of Spain for remaining
</p>
<p>neutral, and added:
</p>
<p>"The views of this sincere friend of France, the King of
</p>
<p>Spain, are too elevated even to dream of entering a choir of
</p>
<p>lunatics."
</p>
<p>"General N." also sought constantly to make the French
</p>
<p>believe that Germany was not wholly responsible for the war,
</p>
<p>that even France was much to blame. In a style, which be-
</p>
<p>trayed the subtleness of Duval, "General N." tried to turn
</p>
<p>the French against themselves. The following article, printed
</p>
<p>Dec. 22, 1916, is typical:
</p>
<p>"At Europe's Tribunal, we should know how to recognize
</p>
<p>our own wrongs also. The Gazette of Frankfort writes very
</p>
<p>judiciously that Europe was waging war even before the
</p>
<p>war. Several newspapers from the other side of the Rhine
</p>
<p>point out that the Entente is hypnotized by the past, when
</p>
<p>as a matter of fact only the future concerns us. We must
</p>
<p>admit this remark is correct.
</p>
<p>"A Hamburg newspaper also points out and with the same
</p>
<p>degree of justice, that if we were to engage ourselves in a
</p>
<p>discussion of the responsibilities of the war if we were to
</p>
<p>try to solve this question without taking any real, practical
</p>
<p>step towards peace we will never obtain peace."
</p>
<p>Behind the camouflage of "General N." Goldsky seemed

</p>
<p>to have completely forgotten his days as a nurse and
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 179
</p>
<p>stretcher bearer. He wrote about army manoeuvers with
</p>
<p>supreme military authority. He always emphasized the point
</p>
<p>that Germany was invulnerable. On August 1, 1916, when
</p>
<p>the Germans were at St. Quentin, he wrote :
</p>
<p>"Germany still has numerous reserves. Thus the French
</p>
<p>nation knows where it stands. It can appreciate how great
</p>
<p>are the sacrifices still to be expected of it, especially if told
</p>
<p>to hold out for the realization of uncertain and remote aims."
</p>
<p>On December 4, 1916, he wrote:
</p>
<p>"All the nations should know what they are fighting for,
</p>
<p>toward what realizations their chiefs are leading them. I
</p>
<p>should think that we have in France other aims than Con-
</p>
<p>stantinople and Cracovia. What are they?"
</p>
<p>The new publications, which Duval planned for various
</p>
<p>circles of readers, who would not buy the Bonnet Rouge were
</p>
<p>assigned to Goldsky, Marion and Landau. Such journal-
</p>
<p>istic tactics are not unknown in America. When a news-
</p>
<p>paper or a hotel gets a bad name, one means of salvation is
</p>
<p>to change its name. The constant attacks upon the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge by Leon Daudet in L' Action Francaise, by Maurice
</p>
<p>Barres in the Echo de Paris; and by many other journalists,
</p>
<p>compelled Almereyda and Duval to affect other masquerades.
</p>
<p>Of this perfidious brood of newspapers, the Republican
</p>
<p>Trench, intended especially for the soldiers at the front,
</p>
<p>worked perhaps the greatest evil. It was founded by Goldsky
</p>
<p>and Landau with 10,000 francs furnished by Duval. Here
</p>
<p>are some of its utterances :
</p>
<p>"The French people are not imbeciles, Messers. Ministers.
</p>
<p>Do you not hear that sound which is constantly growing
</p>
<p>louder, which is becoming so loud that it even begins to
</p>
<p>drown out the roar of battle, the sound of voices which ask
</p>
<p>for peace, which desire the olive branch of love rather than
</p>
<p>the laurels of hatred?"

<p>"The Russian revolution is a revolution against not only
</p>
<p>180 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>the Russian government, but all the other governments of
</p>
<p>Europe. The future alone is important. The only excuse
</p>
<p>for this war is that it will bring forth from all this disaster
</p>
<p>that beautiful flower, which the Russian call, the 'Soviet.'

<p>"Glory to the 'Soviet,' to which we are indebted for the

</p>
<p>The effect of such poison gas upon the soldiers is shown
</p>
<p>by the following letter from a poilu to the director of the
</p>
<p>Republican Trench, and finally seized by government in-
</p>
<p>spectors in a raid on Landau's home.
</p>
<p>"From the Orient Front, June 26, 1917.
</p>
<p>"To the Director of the Trenches:
</p>
<p>"I had recently the pleasure of reading the first number
</p>
<p>of your interesting newspaper. Were I in France, I would
</p>
<p>subscribe to it, but in the Orient our letters and parcels are
</p>
<p>stolen from us. A good newspaper insisting on putting an

<p>end to the war would never reach me.
</p>
<p>"You should have a good collaborator in Macedonia, be-

<p>cause here our officers abuse us. I am one of those, who will
</p>
<p>soon have twenty-one months of the Orient in addition to
</p>
<p>fourteen months of French front, or altogether thirty-five
</p>
<p>months of wholesale butchery without a single minute of

<p>furlough. What a shameful existence is mine !

<p>"The news from France of a lively revolution, which will

<p>liberate us from the sabre and reaction, is certainly reassur-

<p>ing.

<p>"We are with you, brave journalists, and let us hope that

<p>Nation which Duval gave 30,000 francs, and of which Marion
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 181
</p>
<p>was head. Boasting of the power of the Bonnet Rouge cir-
</p>
<p>cle of publications, Goldsky wrote as follows on March
</p>
<p>15, 1917:
</p>
<p>''Around the Bonnet Rouge various organs of opinion have
</p>
<p>been born, each day more numerous, supporting and
</p>
<p>strengthening its position. Dolie founds VAgence Repub-
</p>
<p>licaine, Marion takes charge of the publication of the France
</p>
<p>Tele gramme. Landau is pushing the Primo. Next week,
</p>
<p>Clairet and Bontemps will bring out Le Bloc. . In the Tran~
</p>
<p>cliee I am ambushed.
</p>
<p>"These agencies, these journals are for the Bonnet Rouge,
</p>
<p>what the torpedo fleet is for the cruisers. Altogether we
</p>
<p>continue to advance and with a light heart:"
</p>
<p>Although the Russian Bolsheviks under Lenine and Trot-
</p>
<p>sky did not overthrow the Kerensky government and seize
</p>
<p>Petrograd until Nov. 7, 1917, German propaganda seeking
</p>
<p>to arouse a sympathetic movement in France had been scat-
</p>
<p>tered broadcast through the French Republic by the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge publications throughout the first half of 1917.
</p>
<p>At Barcelona, Spain, a self styled French newspaper was
</p>
<p>founded with the same name as Lenine's Petrograd organ,
</p>
<p>Truth, which aided the Bolshevik campaign in France, and
</p>
<p>which also established a secret connection with the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge.
</p>
<p>This connection cost Duval 10,000 francs of Marx's
</p>
<p>money, and resulted in the Truth's support of Malvy and
</p>
<p>Caillaux. Some typical headlines from the Barcelona paper,
</p>
<p>which were cited by Clemenceau on September 3, 1917, to
</p>
<p>show the far reaching extent of Caillauxism and Bolshevism
</p>
<p>and how in some places they overlapped, read as follows:
</p>
<p>"What Malvy ought to have replied to Clemenceau."
</p>
<p>"The Decline of England."
</p>
<p>"The Man of the Day, Caillaux."

</p>
<p>with the Truth of Barcelona was Joucla. His operations
</p>
<p>182 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>were described long afterward at his trial by Lt. Mornet, his
</p>
<p>prosecutor in the following language:
</p>
<p>"Joucla was a spy as well as a journalist.
</p>
<p>"In the middle of the war he introduced himself to the
</p>
<p>German Consulate General at Barcelona upon presenting his
</p>
<p>card, as an editor of the Bonnet Rouge. He was received
</p>
<p>by a stout gentleman with gold eye glasses and blond hair,
</p>
<p>the Baron Roland, the German Consul General, himself.
</p>
<p>Joucla said he would like to locate a pro-German newspaper
</p>
<p>which had been started in Barcelona, and Baron Roland gave
</p>
<p>the visitor the address of the Truth"
</p>
<p>Joucla also received from Duval 10,000 francs to organize
</p>
<p>a newspaper, called Around the School, which was to streng-
</p>
<p>then still further the Bonnet Rouge's "torpedo fleet."
</p>
<p>At last Duval decided he would have to make another trip
</p>
<p>to Switzerland. He not only needed the Marx money, but
</p>
<p>the Marx approval of all his many enterprises. He wanted
</p>
<p>to make a report concerning his various successes, and if
</p>
<p>possible persuade Marx that the treason payments be greatly
</p>
<p>increased.
</p>
<p>With Landau and Goldsky, Duval had a conference with
</p>
<p>Leymarie, chief director of Malvy's office. Duval told his
</p>
<p>old story about the liquidation of the San Stefano Company.
</p>
<p>Landau and Goldsky backed up Duval, and Leymarie with
</p>
<p>Malvy's sanction ordered the passport issued.
</p>
<p>In Switzerland Duval made such a pleasant impression
</p>
<p>upon Marx, that his request for more money was graciously
</p>
<p>granted. Marx gave him a check for 150,000 francs, dated
</p>
<p>May 12, 1917, and said that many more checks of a much
</p>
<p>larger figure would be forthcoming. Duval had now received
</p>
<p>personally or through Vercassion 925.000 francs from

<p>May 12, 1917 To Duval 150,000 francs.
</p>
<p>925,738 francs.
</p>
<p>But Duval had made one trip too often. It was this 150,-
</p>
<p>000 franc check, which caused the ruin of the whole Boimet
</p>
<p>Rouge gang and the collapse of the Great Conspiracy. Just
</p>
<p>as Duval reached Bellegarde on the Swiss frontier on his re-
</p>
<p>turn to Paris, a number of French officers surrounded him.
</p>
<p>One insisted on making a complete search of all his pos-
</p>
<p>sessions. In the bottom of an inside pocket, they found the
</p>
<p>check.
</p>
<p>"We will keep this," they said. "If you want it back, you
</p>
<p>can go to the Prefecture of Police, Paris."
</p>
<p>A cog in Malvy's machine had gone loose. Despite Malvy's
</p>
<p>own promise, despite the personal intervention of Leymarie,
</p>
<p>despite Duval's reception at Caillaux's country home, he sud-
</p>
<p>denly found himself jolted about like a common suspect, his
</p>
<p>pockets and valises rifled, and his 150,000 franc check gone.
</p>
<p>When the news reached the Bonnet Rouge office, pandi-
</p>
<p>monium broke loose. Goldsky and Landau ran in protest
</p>
<p>to Leymarie, and as soon as Duval reached Paris, they ac-
</p>
<p>companied him to the Ministry of the Interior. Again Duval
</p>
<p>told his San Stefano story, and after some whisperings be-
</p>
<p>tween Malvy and Leymarie, he got his check back.
</p>
<p>But the seizure and restitution of the Duval check started
</p>
<p>too great a scandal to be hid. True, all the papers re-
</p>
<p>lating to the affair were ordered sealed and put away. Sub-
</p>
<p>ordinates in the Ministry of the Interior, who knew Malvy's
</p>
<p>connections with the Bonnet Rouge were made to understand

</p>
<p>it was too delicate a situation to meddle with.

</p>
<p>Indeed, the ghost of the Duval check might have remained
</p>
<p>indefinitely under lock and key, had not Maurice Barres in
</p>
<p>the Chamber of Deputies on July 7, 1917 brought it forth
</p>
<p>in all its ghastliness and made it point its spectral hands at
</p>
<p>Malvy.
</p>
<p>It happened to be a*, a time when the Minister of the In-
</p>
<p>terior occupied the Tribune. He had been trying to justify
</p>
<p>the administration of his office. As if to defend Malvy, a
</p>
<p>socialist named May eras attempted to change the subject, by
</p>
<p>opening an attack on Barres. Barres ignored Mayeras, but
</p>
<p>turning full on Malvy he cried:
</p>
<p>"Since my colleague has given me a chance to speak I will
</p>
<p>ask the Minister of the Interior what measures he is taking
</p>
<p>against the 'Bonnet Rouge' gang? Why does he not have a
</p>
<p>certain 'Bonnet Rouge' rascal arrested?"
</p>
<p>Malvy's face turned white. He seemed to realize that
</p>
<p>from that moment the ghost, which stood before him, would
</p>
<p>never cease to haunt him.
</p>
<p>Premier Ribot, noticing that the Chamber would not let
</p>
<p>the incident pass without more trouble, and that a scandal
</p>
<p>involving Malvy might overthrow his already unsteady cab-
</p>
<p>inet, came to the rescue of his Minister of the Interior. The
</p>
<p>Premier explained that a check thought to be of suspicious
</p>
<p>origin, had been found in the pockets of a Bonnet Rouge
</p>
<p>editor on the Swiss frontier. The matter was being in-

</p>
<p>Next day the patriot newspapers of Paris, which for years
</p>
<p>had been vainly pointing out the dangers of Malvy's inaction,
</p>
<p>concentrated all their fire again on the Minister of the In-
</p>
<p>terior. They demanded the most searching investigation of
</p>
<p>all his dealings with pacifists, defeatists, anarchists and enemy
</p>
<p>agents.
</p>
<p>"Let us know all the truth about Malvy and the 'Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouged cried Daudet in V Action Francaise.
</p>
<p>But these were only the first rumblings of the earthquake.
</p>
<p>The first real shock came on July 22, 1917, when Clemenceau,
</p>
<p>then a Senator, arose before his colleagues in the Palais du
</p>
<p>Luxembourg and openly accused Malvy of betraying France.
</p>
<p>There had been a desultory discussion of an interpellation
</p>
<p>to M. Debierre regarding the administration of the Health
</p>
<p>Bureau. After several had spoken and M. Painleve, Minister
</p>
<p>of War, was about to leave the Chamber, Clemenceau mounted
</p>
<p>the Tribune and said :
</p>
<p>"We must put some order in this country."
</p>
<p>There was an ominous ring in these words which arrested
</p>
<p>attention.
</p>
<p>"The situation has become so grave, that some attention

</p>
<p>must be taken," he continued. "The nation is beset with perils
</p>
<p>ivithin, as well as without. Let us see what these dangers are."
</p>
<p>Looking at Malvy, the "Tiger" measured his distance and
</p>
<p>prepared to spring. Malvy's face turned white.
</p>
<p>"There is a notebook in the Ministry of the Interior, known
</p>
<p>as Garnet B," said Clemenceau. "It contains the names of
</p>
<p>anarchists and anti militarists, who should be watched at all
</p>
<p>times, and during mobilization, arrested.
</p>
<p>"At the outbreak of the war, it was the duty of M. Malvy
</p>
<p>to have put this dangerous element where it could have done
</p>
<p>no harm. But M. Malvy did nothing. He consulted me
</p>
<p>about the matter at the time, but whatever may have been my
</p>
<p>advice, he took no official action. Instead, he permitted Al-
</p>
<p>mereyda to act for him in negociating with these people.
</p>
<p>"And, who is Almereyda?"
</p>
<p>Here Clemenceau read from police records a long list of
</p>
<p>crimes for which Almereyda had been convicted. It showed
</p>
<p>that the life of Malvy's associate had been one long chapter
</p>
<p>of violence and iniquity. Most of all it revealed him as the
</p>
<p>implacable enemy of government. Clemenceau read extracts
</p>
<p>from Almereyda's Rheims speech urging the people to fight
</p>
<p>enlistment in the army, and ending with the words: "Each
</p>
<p>fellow countrymen should be anti patriotic. It should make
</p>
<p>no difference whether he is a German or a Frenchman."
</p>
<p>Clemenceau's four score years seemed to vibrate with all
</p>
<p>the vigor of early youth, as he pointed again toward Malvy
</p>
<p>and cried:
</p>
<p>"Tell me. How is it that the author of such a speech has
</p>
<p>been able to find friendly access to all the departments of the
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior? I never saw the Garnet B, but it
</p>
<p>would be the dispair of both God and man, if Almereyda
</p>
<p>were not in it. However, Almereyda is in it, and Almereyda
</p>
<p>knows he is in it. He also knows that he rejoiced to see the
</p>
<p>man who now holds this book made Minister of the Interior."

</p>
<p>Clemenceau spoke of a visit to the Bonnet Rouge office on
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 187
</p>
<p>Oct. 31, 1915. He said that Almereyda told of a convers-
</p>
<p>ation which Clemenceau reproduced as follows:
</p>
<p>"Almereyda, 'What are you doing with the note book B?'
</p>
<p>"Malvy, I am glad you spoke of that.'
</p>
<p>"Almere} r da, 'I will tell you what to do. Arrest no one.' "
</p>
<p>Again pointing at Malvy, Clemenceau thundered: "And
</p>
<p>that was the order. Arrest no one."
</p>
<p>The Senator told of other conversations between Almereyda
</p>
<p>and Malvy. One concerned a nest of anarchists, which Al-
</p>
<p>mereyda promised to visit within the next twenty four hours
</p>
<p>upon Malvy's promise that if Almereyda came back and said,
</p>
<p>"Nothing to fear", Malvy would take no action.
</p>
<p>After reading more documents to prove his charges, Clem-
</p>
<p>enceau continued:
</p>
<p>"I am not prepared to condemn M. Malvy, simply for not
</p>
<p>having caused the arrest of everyone whose name was in the
</p>
<p>Garnet B. My criticism is that he should not have put it
</p>
<p>into a drawer and thrown the key into the Seine. I think
</p>
<p>the Garnet B should have been used to watch these men, to
</p>
<p>watch them very closely, and if any one of them, in spite of
</p>
<p>the promise of Almereyda, their worthy Ambassador, should,
</p>
<p>resume his old practices, then the amnesty should end. Such
</p>
<p>an individual should be seized. This M. Malvy has not dcr.e.
</p>
<p>"Now, we come to the question of the documents, dis-
</p>
<p>tributed by anarchists, pacifists, and other malcontents. We
</p>
<p>went before the Commission of the Army. M. Ribot and M.
</p>
<p>Malvy were there. I asked them for the monthly reports of
</p>
<p>the last six months relating to anti-patriotic propaganda.
</p>
<p>M. Ribot said we could have them. Well, I confess that as
</p>
<p>soon as he said, 'yes', I knew the next day he would say, 'no.'
</p>
<p>And sure enough, the following day, M. Ribot wrote us that
</p>
<p>he had seen the reports, but could not let us have them, be-
</p>
<p>cause they contained names which could not be made public.

</p>
<p>gravity, but of which the secrets never leave the Commission
</p>
<p>of the Army. Nevertheless, we finally obtained these papers.
</p>
<p>(Clemenceau was President of the Army Commission.)
</p>
<p>"I shall not divulge any of the names found in these docu-
</p>
<p>ments. I simply want to make the point clear, that these men,
</p>
<p>who have been told they would not be prosecuted, began, like
</p>
<p>the rats of the fable, to show their noses out of the hole, and
</p>
<p>when they saw they were safe, when they learned that they
</p>
<p>could start agitations and hold meetings without being pro-
</p>
<p>secuted, they became bolder and bolder.
</p>
<p>"The first evidence of this return to the offensive dates
</p>
<p>back to November 22, 1914. As I will not mention names, I
</p>
<p>will refer to the author of this document, as X. He says :
</p>
<p>" 'To talk peace is the duty of all workingmen's organiz-
</p>
<p>ations.'
</p>
<p>" 'The responsibility of the French, English and Russian
</p>
<p>governments is not a light one. Furthermore, it has not been
</p>
<p>established that the French government did everything it
</p>
<p>could to safeguard peace during the last days of July."
</p>
<p>The speaker was interrupted by a storm of exclamations,
</p>
<p>among which could be heard the voice of Senator Guilloteaux,
</p>
<p>gaying:
</p>
<p>"The abominable lie."
</p>
<p>"You see the tendency of these men," continued Clem-
</p>
<p>enceau. "At first they remain close to the goverment, of
</p>
<p>which M. Malvy is a part ; and then beginning in November,
</p>
<p>1914, they say:
</p>
<p>" 'It is not certain, that you did not provoke the war.' '
</p>
<p>"Whoever said that are Boches," shouted Senator Guillo-
</p>
<p>teaux, again drowning out the cries of his colleagues.
</p>
<p>"I will read from other reports," said Clemenceau.
</p>
<p>"Z declares at Lyons that 'this ignominious and monstrous
</p>
<p>war' had been wished and prepared by England since 1904.

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 189
</p>
<p>soldiers. The German people deserve the first place in the
</p>
<p>world because of their social and economic superiority.' "
</p>
<p>Senator Clemenceau was again interrupted by lively ex-
</p>
<p>clamations, but continued:
</p>
<p>"Here are other circulars, for example: 'All Frenchmen
</p>
<p>should have responded to the order of mobilization by a gen-
</p>
<p>eral strike and insurrection. I have no country, and to live
</p>
<p>under the Prussian heel or the French heel makes no difference
</p>
<p>to me.
</p>
<p>"And now listen to the worst of all," said the aged Senator,
</p>
<p>pausing.
</p>
<p>"Here is a proclamation that says :
</p>
<p>" 'It is the German regime, which is the best. Perhaps, at
</p>
<p>this moment, German administration is rather harsh, because
</p>
<p>of the privations caused by the blockade, but, in general, all
</p>
<p>that is said about the Germans has been exaggerated. Ac-
</p>
<p>cording to certain conversations with people who have left
</p>
<p>Germany, it is not the Germans who make life hard for the
</p>
<p>prisoners, but the Allied officers among the prisoners."
</p>
<p>Referring to the strikes, Clemenceau said:
</p>
<p>"It was also M. Malvy, who brought up the strike question
</p>
<p>that he might have the glory of saying: 'Ah, that poor
</p>
<p>Lloyd George. How much trouble he has with strikes, while
</p>
<p>I, Malvy, in accord with my friend, Almereyda, have obtained
</p>
<p>admirable results by suppressing the Garnet B.
</p>
<p>"I will cite an example of M. Malvy's methods. There was
</p>
<p>a meeting in a government establishment. An anarchist
</p>
<p>preached all manner of revolt and lawlessness. He told the
</p>
<p>workers to stop work. There was no prosecution. The
</p>
<p>policeman present excused the anarchist. He conducted the
</p>
<p>fellow to the railroad station, and saluted by doffing his cap.
</p>
<p>Complaints demanded an investigation. When M. Malvy
</p>
<p>learned the facts, he excused both anarchist and policeman.
</p>
<p>"It has been said that no revolutionary plot lurks behind

</p>
<p>these strikes. Let us see. I will read some official reports to
</p>
<p>190 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>the Minister of the Interior. Here is one from M. Rault, pre-
</p>
<p>fect of Lyons, who writes :
</p>
<p>" 'I am under the very clear impression, that an agitation
</p>
<p>is being hatched secretly in certain parts of the city and
</p>
<p>suburbs. I believe we may be on the eve of serious develop-
</p>
<p>ments.
</p>
<p>" 'The strikes in Paris have precipitated a most serious
</p>
<p>situation here. The union of syndicates and an anarchistic
</p>
<p>group, of which the anarchist X is secretary, seconded, by
</p>
<p>Z., have taken advantage of the Paris 'events to start a strike
</p>
<p>movement in Lyons.'
</p>
<p>"There you can see the connection between the revolution-
</p>
<p>ists and the strikes. Both are the same thing. The strikes
</p>
<p>were not only for the vindication of the workingmen. They
</p>
<p>have been fostered by certain individuals, who hoped through
</p>
<p>them to create pacifist opinion."
</p>
<p>From a heap of pamphlets before him, circulars, posters,
</p>
<p>manifestos of anarchists, defeatists and others of kindred
</p>
<p>sort, the Senator took a handful and continued:
</p>
<p>"I shall read only one passage from these abominable pam-
</p>
<p>phlets, which have been permitted to be sent into the trenches,
</p>
<p>which have arrived there in huge bales, and which the army
</p>
<p>officers cannot stop. We have the right to examine them, and
</p>
<p>to ask the Minister of the Interior.
</p>
<p>"'Why do you not put an end to this propaganda?'
</p>
<p>"Here is a sample. It reads :
</p>
<p>" 'The soldiers of all countries at war should follow the
</p>
<p>counsel given to them by Liebknecht, when he proposed that
</p>
<p>they turn their arms against their own government.
</p>
<p>" 'The workingmen with arms in their hands should break
</p>
<p>the power of the bureaucratic and militarist State, and over-
</p>
<p>throw their governments. After having arrested the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of public administrations, they should form a govern-
</p>
<p>ment composed of the proletariat. These workingmen's gov-

<p>ernments should take possession of all the banks, of all the
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 191
</p>
<p>corporations of any importance, and institute with all the
</p>
<p>energy of the capitalists, the mobilization of the proletariat.
</p>
<p>" 'It is not in vain that in all countries, the so-called com-
</p>
<p>mon people learn how to use arms. If in 1912 Serbian and
</p>
<p>Bulgarian peasants were able to hasten the termination of
</p>
<p>that war by shooting their officers, the French, German and
</p>
<p>English workingmen can do likewise.'
</p>
<p>"And this is the vile kind of stuff which has been permitted
</p>
<p>to be circulated." said Clemenceau. "I think that even when
</p>
<p>pamphlets do not show the name of the printer, those re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for their distribution can be reached and seized."
</p>
<p>Among other criticisms of Malvy, Senator Clemenceau
</p>
<p>cited the escape of deserters as the direct result of the neg-
</p>
<p>ligence of the Minister of the Interior. Continuing, he said:
</p>
<p>"On July 17, 1917, the Prefect of Police wrote to M.
</p>
<p>Malvy that he had found the address of the syndicalist, anti
</p>
<p>patriotic deserter, Cochon, who had been defended by Al-
</p>
<p>mereyda in the 'Bonnet Rouge 9 . He asked the Minister of
</p>
<p>the Interior for instructions to arrest Cochon.
</p>
<p>"Three days later, the Prefect of Police again wrote to
</p>
<p>M. Malvy that as the instructions had not come on time,
</p>
<p>Cochon had escaped."
</p>
<p>.At this point Malvy, who had been bending forward fur-
</p>
<p>ther and further to catch all that Clemenceau said, leaped to
</p>
<p>his feet with this interjection:
</p>
<p>" 'On the instant, I gave the Prefect of Police the order to
</p>
<p>arrest that deserter."
</p>
<p>"You did not give it on time," insisted Clemenceau. M.
</p>
<p>Cochon was forewarned. There is no doubt about it. And
</p>
<p>Cochon is that ignominious syndicalist anti proprietor, anti
</p>
<p>patriot, whom you all know."
</p>
<p>"I give you my word of honor," implored Malvy.
</p>
<p>"What," exclaimed Clemenceau. "What was your pur-
</p>
<p>pose in compelling your prefects to ask you for instructions,

</p>
<p>before making such arrests? In a country three years at
</p>
<p>192 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>war, in a country invaded by the enemy, why should it re-
</p>
<p>quire specific instructions from the Minister of the Interior
</p>
<p>before arresting a deserter? Explain that to me. Now, sir,
</p>
<p>it is your turn to speak."
</p>
<p>The "Tiger" had sprung. Malvy tried hard to show he did
</p>
<p>not feel the claws, but failed. Half stammering, he replied:
</p>
<p>"But, M. Clemenceau, I-I, in fact I had been advised by
</p>
<p>the Prefect of Police, that they they merely thought they
</p>
<p>had found Cochon's abode."
</p>
<p>"Sir, you are not answering the question," cried CLem-
</p>
<p>enceau, "I have asked you how you could explain your con-
</p>
<p>duct, how in a country three years at war, in a country in-
</p>
<p>vaded, it should be necessary for a prefect of police to ask
</p>
<p>the authorization of the Minister of the Interior for the arrest
</p>
<p>of a deserter. (Prolonged applause)
</p>
<p>"But I must pass on. I wish to say something of the way
</p>
<p>foreigners have been watched during the war.
</p>
<p>"M. Malvy has left the doors wide open. Let me give you
</p>
<p>an instance. A friend of mine, a Dr. Baratoux, a widely
</p>
<p>known specialist of Paris, a man widely known and greatly
</p>
<p>esteemed, was taking a walk at Dinard on September 20,
</p>
<p>1914, only eight weeks after the declaration of war. He
</p>
<p>saw an automobile surrounded by an excited crowd, which
</p>
<p>was yelling:
</p>
<p>" 'Down with the Germans ! Down with the Boches !'
</p>
<p><c Dr. Baratoux approached, and finding that the auto-
</p>
<p>mobilists were trying to start the motor and escape he threat-
</p>
<p>ened to puncture a tire. Finally, he compelled two men to
</p>
<p>get out of the car. They were two Germans, M. Pollack and
</p>
<p>M. Braun, who were travelling with a permit from the Min-
</p>
<p>ister of the Interior.
</p>
<p>"The physician immediately reported these facts to a

<p>"In indignation the doctor pasted on his window the
</p>
<p>Mayor's proclamation and beside it a clipping from a Paris
</p>
<p>newspaper, which stated that in Munich French prisoners
</p>
<p>were being exhibited in a public garden for 10 pfennigs ad-
</p>
<p>mission. The following day the Mayor gave vent to his
</p>
<p>anger by sending this statement to 'La Guerre\ the news-
</p>
<p>paper published under the control of the municipality of
</p>
<p>Dinard :
</p>
<p>" 'I dedicate these lines to some anonymous brutes, who by
</p>
<p>letters or posters have reproached the Mayor of Dinard with
</p>
<p>a lack of patriotism because he did his utmost to prevent a
</p>
<p>certain number of excited people from molesting the few
</p>
<p>Germans and Austrians who remained here after the mobili-
</p>
<p>zation.' (Exclamations)
</p>
<p>"This is only one incident, but it furnishes some idea of the
</p>
<p>whole picture, the condition of all France seven weeks after
</p>
<p>the declaration of war. Alien enemies were roaming around
</p>
<p>everywhere."
</p>
<p>After mentioning several more instances of Germans and
</p>
<p>Austrians operating with perfect freedom in various places,
</p>
<p>Clemenceau continued:
</p>
<p>"In all these incidents you will find that the Minister of
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs has clashed with the Minister of the Interior.
</p>
<p>The former wanted alien enemies put under guard, that there
</p>
<p>might not be any chance of wrong doing. But as for Malvy,
</p>
<p>he was so lenient with the anti patriots, so anxious to guaran-
</p>
<p>tee them against the law, so generous and kind, that his
</p>
<p>fame will endure for a long, long time.
</p>
<p>"M. Malvy can only offer an embarassed reply. He ex-
</p>
<p>plains that he must handle the working classes with tact. He
</p>
<p>*ays:
</p>
<p>" 'You have asked me to act with energy. I reply that an

<p>obstinate and vigilant patience, an appeal to reason in the

<p>of repression.' "
</p>
<p>194 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"Very well," "very well" chorused the socialists on the
</p>
<p>Left. Simultaneously Malvy cried:
</p>
<p>"You have reproached me with not having brought you
</p>
<p>enough heads. Instead I brought you results, and it is upon
</p>
<p>these results that I ask the High Assembly to judge me."
</p>
<p>Again the "Tiger" sprang. He cried:
</p>
<p>"No, no, I reproach you for having betrayed your coun-
</p>
<p>try."
</p>
<p>The public was aroused by Clemenceau's speech to white
</p>
<p>heat. It demanded that he be placed at the head of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment and permitted to purge France of the evils he had
</p>
<p>revealed.
</p>
<p>At this crisis, when the chief plotters of the Great Con-
</p>
<p>spiracy realized they were doomed, unless all possible evidence
</p>
<p>of their crimes was destroyed, unless every tongue, that
</p>
<p>might tell, was silenced, Almereyda was suddenly struck dead.
</p>
<p>Only a few days after Clemenceau's speech the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge editor-in-chief was arrested and taken to Fresnes
</p>
<p>prison. On August 14, 1917, a little more than three weeks
</p>
<p>later his body was found half prostrate on the floor of his
</p>
<p>cell. At first sight, it looked as if he had hung himself from
</p>
<p>a bed post.
</p>
<p>The first report of the jail authorities called it "suicide."
</p>
<p>There was another investigation, and three physicians, Dr.
</p>
<p>Socquet, Dr. Dervieux and Dr. Vibert visited the prison. The
</p>
<p>body was found laid upon a bed. It was covered with a sheet
</p>
<p>which stretched from head to foot.
</p>
<p>"Lift up the sheet", ordered Dr. Dervieux.
</p>
<p>A guard pulled back the cloth to the knees.
</p>
<p>"Lift up the sheet," repeated the doctor.
</p>
<p>Even more slowly the guard obeyed. The thighs, the
</p>
<p>breast were exposed.

</p>
<p>The body was now fully exposed. The doctors looked closer
</p>
<p>and discovered around the neck a thin black line, where a

<p>cord had been drawn so tightlythat it had nearly cut through

<p>the flesh. It was in the very same place, where Almereyda

</p>
<p>With Greater Perils Clemenceau, Man of The Hour At
</p>
<p>Last Called to Premiership Demand Caillaux Be Tried
</p>
<p>The tragedy of Almereyda's death aroused the nation to
</p>
<p>demand still more insistently that the traitors of France be
</p>
<p>punished. A storm of public censure at last drove Malvy out
</p>
<p>of office. He resigned, as Minister of the Interior, on August
</p>
<p>31, 1917.
</p>
<p>The Bonnet Rouge gang was panic striken. Duval was
</p>
<p>arrested two days after Almereyda's death. Goldsky and
</p>
<p>Landau were put in jail on September 24 ; and five days later
</p>
<p>Bolo Pacha, while dining at the Grand Hotel, just across
</p>
<p>from the Opera in the center of Paris, was informed he too
</p>
<p>must go to prison.
</p>
<p>But the power of Malvy, though out of office, remained
</p>
<p>tremendously strong. His socialistic followers refused to
</p>
<p>believe the stories about him. The socialistic newspapers
</p>
<p>kept emphasizing the statement of Clemenceau, that Malvy
</p>
<p>could not be charged with high treason, but neglect of duty :
</p>
<p>and the question of duty, they said, was a very broad one.
</p>
<p>Premier Painleve, who succeeded Ribot, Sept. 10, 1917,
</p>
<p>took a weak, irresolute attitude. It looked as if the myster-
</p>
<p>ious influence of Caillaux would hush up the scandal, until
</p>
<p>Leon Daudet again took up the fight, He said that after

</p>
<p>Malvy had been admitted to the Council of War, the enemy
</p>
<p>was obtaining French war secrets and defeating the French
</p>
<p>armies with unfailing success. Finally, Daudet wrote the
</p>
<p>following letter to President Poincare:
</p>
<p>"I address myself to you because it is important that you
</p>
<p>should be informed of what no longer is a secret; also be-
</p>
<p>cause you have a great role to play and can save France.
</p>
<p>"M. Malvy, former Minister of the Interior, is a traitor.
</p>
<p>He has betrayed the national defense for three years with the
</p>
<p>complicity of M. Leymarie and some others. Proofs of this
</p>
<p>treason superabound. It would be too long a story to lay
</p>
<p>them before you. Be assured only that M. Malvy has kept
</p>
<p>Germany fully informed of all our military and diplomatic
</p>
<p>plans, notably through the gang of spies of the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge, through his friend Vigo (Almereyda) and through
</p>
<p>one Souter, Director of the Maggi Kub, (Az Beef Extract
</p>
<p>Company).
</p>
<p>"It was thus the German High Command knew, point by
</p>
<p>point, the plan to attack the Chemins des Dames. See the
</p>
<p>Spanish newspaper, A. B. C. of July 23, 1917. When Malvy
</p>
<p>was admitted to the Council of War it was with applause from
</p>
<p>the Bonnet Rouge.
</p>
<p>"Know also that documents of indisputable authority show
</p>
<p>the hand of M. Malvy and of the Surete Generde in the mil-
</p>
<p>itary mutinies and the tragic events of June, 1917.
</p>
<p>"It lies with you Mr. President, to verify these accusations
</p>
<p>by a rapid investigation, which will be an easy matter for you,
</p>
<p>and to do prompt justice, for it is reported that Germany,
</p>
<p>to demoralize the public still further, is prepared to abandon
</p>
<p>M. Malvy in a short time as useless to her cause.
</p>
<p>"The only means to destroy the German plans, therefore,
</p>
<p>is to act and bring before the military tribunals the wretch
</p>
<p>who has delivered France morsel by morsel to the enemy,

</p>
<p>man with regards to you, Mr. President, I would wish
</p>
<p>to fix a date with a view to later eventualities, and remain
</p>
<p>"Very respectfully yours
</p>
<p>"Leon Daudet."
</p>
<p>President Poincare immediately asked Malvy for an ex-
</p>
<p>planation, and Malvy on October 4, 1918, went before the
</p>
<p>Chamber of Deputies, and asked that Poincare read Daudet's
</p>
<p>letter. In a frenzied speech Malvy branded Daudet as a
</p>
<p>vicious slanderer. Premier Painleve promised the Chamber
</p>
<p>that Daudet would be obliged to prove his words. The Min-
</p>
<p>ister of Justice, M. Peret, instead of leaping at the opport-
</p>
<p>unity of aiding Daudet, said that the law, as it then stood,
</p>
<p>made it impossible to prosecute Daudet, but that he would
</p>
<p>undertake to introduce a bill, "making impossible a repetition
</p>
<p>of such slanderous acts, which sowed distrust and pessimism
</p>
<p>throughout the country."
</p>
<p>On top of this statement from the Minister of Justice, and
</p>
<p>the very next day after Daudet's letter was read in the
</p>
<p>Chamber, his newspaper offices were raided, and the edition
</p>
<p>of r Action Franfaise for Oct. 5, was seized.
</p>
<p>Meantime, such papers as Le Pays, a pro Caillaux organ,
</p>
<p>kept insisting that Daudet was simply trying to discredit
</p>
<p>democratic institutions. They said that through his attacks
</p>
<p>on Malvy, Daudet hoped to overthrow the republic and again
</p>
<p>enthrone the royalists. Whether or not Painleve listened to
</p>
<p>these politicial sirens, he at all events steered the Ship of
</p>
<p>State toward the rocks. He decided to let Malvy escape. On
</p>
<p>October 15, 1917, he reported to his Cabinet that all the ac-
</p>
<p>cusations against the former Minister of the Interior, whether
</p>
<p>of communicating military and diplomatic documents to the
</p>
<p>enemy or of complicity in military disturbances were quite
</p>
<p>unfounded.
</p>
<p>The government, he asserted, was detirmined not to inter-
</p>
<p>fere or to tolerate interference with judicial proceedure. In

<p>other words, Painleve persisted in following the laissez faire
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 199
</p>
<p>policy of his predecessors and "let the traitors catch them-
</p>
<p>selves" as one French critic expressed it.
</p>
<p>Painleve's attitude was characterized by Daudet as "stupi-
</p>
<p>fying."
</p>
<p>"On the one hand," he wrote, "the Premier usurps the
</p>
<p>judicial authority, which is alone competent to handle this
</p>
<p>matter, and declares my charges unfounded. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, he affirms that he is resolved not to encroach on that
</p>
<p>same authority, which he tramples under foot."
</p>
<p>Painleve reply to Daudet's criticisms took the form of
</p>
<p>another raid on the offices of V Action Franfaise. On Oct-
</p>
<p>ober 28, the police descended upon the editor, seized five re-
</p>
<p>volvers, a few other firearms and a dagger, which decorated
</p>
<p>the walls, and then rummaged through Daudet's desks. The
</p>
<p>director of the judicial police submitted his report to the
</p>
<p>Minister of Justice, who had already attacked Daudet as a
</p>
<p>slanderer, and as a result the following official communique
</p>
<p>was issued:
</p>
<p>"Searches were carried out last evening which resulted in
</p>
<p>the seizure of a quantity of arms which came under the pro-
</p>
<p>hibition instituted since the beginning of the war, as well as
</p>
<p>documents of great importance. An investigation has been
</p>
<p>begun of movements tending to provoke civil war by arming
</p>
<p>citizens against one another."
</p>
<p>These charges against Daudet were proved preposterous,
</p>
<p>and Painleve was cartooned as the modern Don Quixote.
</p>
<p>The most serious blow at the Painleve ministry, however,
</p>
<p>was the connection finally revealed between Sergeant Paix-
</p>
<p>Seailles, an assistant in the Premier's own office, and Al-
</p>
<p>mereyda. On Nov. 6, Captain Mangin Bocquet, Judge Ad-
</p>
<p>vocate, attached to the second Paris court martial,became
</p>
<p>dissatisfied with the explanation of Paix-Seailles, concerning
</p>
<p>his connections with the Bonnet Rouge, and formally
</p>
<p>charged him with communicating to a newspaper the letters

<p>and reports of General Sarrail.
</p>
<p>200 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>On the following day, November 7, the Bolsheviks over-
</p>
<p>threw Russia and placed Lenine in supreme command in Pet-
</p>
<p>rograd. The news spread through France like wild fire. The
</p>
<p>socialists, who had been somewhat cowed by the resignation
</p>
<p>of Malvy, the death of Almereyda and the arrest of most of
</p>
<p>his associates, paid no heed to the Paix-Seailles affair and
</p>
<p>began their propaganda anew.
</p>
<p>Among the French troops renewed efforts were made to
</p>
<p>start a proletariat revolution. The following poster also
</p>
<p>appeared in nearly all the munition plants :
</p>
<p>"Our Peace Terms:
</p>
<p>"We propose to the workers that they reflect upon the
</p>
<p>conditions of peace which we propose and that they discuss
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>"Explain to the soldiers that they will be able to secure a
</p>
<p>democratic and durable peace. The soldiers of all the warring
</p>
<p>nations should follow the advice of Liebknecht, when he asked
</p>
<p>them to turn their arms against their own government, advice
</p>
<p>for which he had been condemned to hard labor.
</p>
<p>"The workingman, with arms in his hands, should break the
</p>
<p>power of the bureaucratic and militaristic state, overthrow
</p>
<p>the government heads, arrest those in public power, and form
</p>
<p>a government composed of the representatives of the pro-
</p>
<p>letariat. The Commune of Paris in 1871 and the Council of
</p>
<p>Workingmen's Delegates in 1905 in certain cities of Russia,
</p>
<p>were governments of this kind.
</p>
<p>"These workingmen's governments should take possession
</p>
<p>of all the banks and of all undertakings of importance, and
</p>
<p>institute, with an energy equal to that displayed by the
</p>
<p>capitalists at the present time, the mobilization of the pro-
</p>
<p>letariat."
</p>
<p>The dangers confronting France now became so alarming,
</p>
<p>that the public insisted more than ever that Clemenceau, who
</p>
<p>had long urged the most relentless warfare against the enemy

<p>within, be made Premier. On November 18, 1917, Painlev
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 201
</p>
<p>fell. Despite his own personal prejudices, President Poincare
</p>
<p>heeded the voice of the people and placed Clemenceau in
</p>
<p>command. Instantly the "Tiger" made good his promise.
</p>
<p>Not only did he seek by every possible means to strengthen
</p>
<p>and encourage the armies of the republic to redouble the
</p>
<p>fight against the invader, but he ordered a most searching
</p>
<p>investigation of all the plots of internal disruption.
</p>
<p>"Death for the traitors", became one of the slogans of the
</p>
<p>new administration.
</p>
<p>The situation, however, was extremely critical. The power
</p>
<p>of Caillaux and Malvy, the dangers of socialistic ferment,
</p>
<p>which had frightened his predecessors, menaced Clemenceau
</p>
<p>from the very beginning. Many predicted that he could not
</p>
<p>possibly wage two wars, the one within, the other without.
</p>
<p>In his book, "Clemenceau", Gustave Geffroy, president of
</p>
<p>the Academy Goncourt, and one of Clemenceau's life long
</p>
<p>friends, writes of this perilous period as follows:
</p>
<p>"Clemenceau left his newspaper to take the first place in
</p>
<p>the Cabinet. He became Premier and Minister of War after
</p>
<p>the third year of the conflict. He entered office under diffi-
</p>
<p>cult and critical circumstances.
</p>
<p>"The events in Russia had changed the conditions of war
</p>
<p>by liberating numerous German corps of the Eastern Army.
</p>
<p>The fatigue of the trenches and of battles without visible
</p>
<p>results had been anticipated by Germany, and her pacifist
</p>
<p>or defaitiste propaganda had been pushed with still greater
</p>
<p>vigor, aided by the criminal intrigues of some and the culp-
</p>
<p>able disinterestedness of others.
</p>
<p>"Serious riots had demoralized in certain places the dis-
</p>
<p>cipline of the army. This nefarious propaganda was carried
</p>
<p>on throughout France. Clemenceau, who had already warn-
</p>
<p>ed the government and the Parliament of the dangers of the
</p>
<p>situation during secret sessions, made up his mind to publish
</p>
<p>his criticisms and his warnings, and he did so in his speech

<p>of July 22, 1917 in the Senate.
</p>
<p>202 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"This energetic intervention brought Clemenceau into con-
</p>
<p>trol of the Government. Without further details, I may say
</p>
<p>that Clemenceau, in devoting himself utterly to waging war
</p>
<p>without and within, in letting the civilian and military courts
</p>
<p>of justice to be free to inquire into all offences and crimes, in
</p>
<p>convincing the Allies to estabish unity of command at the
</p>
<p>front, in persuading England to send over to France a new
</p>
<p>expeditionary corps, in getting America to hasten the trans-
</p>
<p>portation of men, food and munitions, turned the tide of the
</p>
<p>war."
</p>
<p>Malvy now made one more desperate effort to escape. Still
</p>
<p>a deputy, representing the Department of Lot, he believed he
</p>
<p>still had enough friends in public life to trust himself to their
</p>
<p>mercies. On November 22, therefore, he asked that he be sent
</p>
<p>before the Senate, sitting as a High Court, and tried on the
</p>
<p>charge of treason.
</p>
<p>"It was a theatrical effort," said La Revue des Causes
</p>
<p>Celebres. "M. Malvy might have dragged those, whom he
</p>
<p>considered his 'calumniators', into a criminal court, but he
</p>
<p>preferred to address himself to a political tribunal." After a
</p>
<p>very tumultuous and passionate discussion, M. Louis Nail,
</p>
<p>Keeper of the Seals, declared that it was the clear wish of
</p>
<p>the government to know, as soon as possible, the entire truth.
</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Chamber decided to convene immediately and
</p>
<p>appoint a commission of thirty men. This was done. Upon
</p>
<p>a report of M. Louis Puech, the resolution was voted that
</p>
<p>same day.
</p>
<p>Six days later, on November 28, after a nine hour tum-
</p>
<p>ultuous session, the Chamber voted unanimously that Malvy
</p>
<p>be sent to the High Court.
</p>
<p>Premier Clemenceau intervened in the debate only long
</p>
<p>enough to show that new scandals were being unearthed at
</p>
<p>every turn of the investigation of Malvy's administration.

<p>dossier was discovered tucked away at Police Headquarters."
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 203
</p>
<p>Before Malvy could be placed on trial, Clemenceau struck
</p>
<p>again. At last he threw the light of inquisition upon the
</p>
<p>mysterious, lurking figure behind Malvy, and brought out
</p>
<p>into clear relief the hypnotic face of Caillaux.
</p>
<p>On December 10, the Premier informed his Cabinet that
</p>
<p>evidence had been obtained, which made necessary the prose-
</p>
<p>cution of Malvy's master for conspiring with the enemy. In
</p>
<p>various official circles it was also rumored that Almereyda's
</p>
<p>strong box had been discovered and in it had been found new
</p>
<p>proof against Caillaux. Two days later, Dec. 12, a report
</p>
<p>addressed to the President of the Chamber of Deputies by
</p>
<p>General Dubail, the Military Governor of Paris, was made
</p>
<p>public, which revealed Caillaux as having been in constant
</p>
<p>touch with Bolo Pacha and practically all of the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge gang. The report asked authorization to prosecute
</p>
<p>Caillaux. The effect upon some of the socialist members of
</p>
<p>the Chamber was stupefying.
</p>
<p>"The intrigues of Caillaux tended to disrupt the Allies
</p>
<p>and precipitate a premature, dishonorable peace with Ger-
</p>
<p>many" said General Dubail. "Investigations of various
</p>
<p>persons accused of communication and commerce with the
</p>
<p>enemy have discovered in the possession of nearly all a great
</p>
<p>number of letters from Caillaux.
</p>
<p>"The examination of this correspondence is singularly dis-
</p>
<p>turbing, and necessity requires that it should be brought
</p>
<p>to the attention of justice. It is a serious matter, that a
</p>
<p>statesman of such importance as Joseph Caillaux, who has
</p>
<p>occupied the highest positions of state, who has had the
</p>
<p>honor of directing the policy of his country and has assumed
</p>
<p>willingly the leadership of a great party, should maintain
</p>
<p>close and intimate relations, which cannot be denied, with
</p>
<p>French or foreign adventurers, whose actions and tendencies
</p>
<p>since the beginning of the war render them objects of sus-

</p>
<p>picion to the least informed minds.
</p>
<p>204 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"The correspondence seized in the Bolo Pacha investigation
</p>
<p>is particularly suggestive.
</p>
<p>"In the house of the 'Bonnet Rouge' where the safes were
</p>
<p>full of German money, Caillaux counted many friends. He
</p>
<p>was in correspondence, for example, with Jacques Landau,
</p>
<p>and he aided by gift of money the founding of the 'Tranchee
</p>
<p>Republicaine'. He received at his home at Mamers, M. Duval,
</p>
<p>business manager of the 'Bonnet Rouge', M. Marion ad-
</p>
<p>ministrator of the 'Bonnet Rouge' and manager of the
</p>
<p>*Courrier Viticole', M. Landau and M. Goldsky, all connected
</p>
<p>with the 'Bonnet Rouge' scandal. The whole band went from
</p>
<p>Paris in an automobile to visit him."
</p>
<p>The letters which Caillaux wrote Bolo were quoted by
</p>
<p>General Dubail to show that the former Premier wanted to
</p>
<p>talk with Bolo about his trip to America.
</p>
<p>In a letter to Bolo from Rome, dated Oct. 29, 1916, Caill-
</p>
<p>aux wrote :
</p>
<p>"Soon, dear friend, I must talk seriously with you of a
</p>
<p>great many things."
</p>
<p>There were three charges on which General Dubail asked
</p>
<p>authority to prosecute Caillaux, namely.
</p>
<p>Endangering the safety of the state by acts tending to
</p>
<p>compromise the alliances concluded between France and for-
</p>
<p>eign powers.
</p>
<p>Entering into treasonable relations with the enemy.
</p>
<p>Disseminating peace propaganda which demoralized the
</p>
<p>Allies and aided the foe.
</p>
<p>The accusations fall under articles 76, 77, 78 and 79 of
</p>
<p>the Penal Code, which make it a death penalty "to conspire
</p>
<p>or have dealings with foreign powers or their agents or to
</p>
<p>conspire with the enemy to weaken the fidelity of officers,
</p>
<p>soldiers and sailors."
</p>
<p>Deputy Louis Loustalot was also involved in General

<p>Dubail's charges. He was said to have served as an inter-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 205
</p>
<p>mediary between Caillaux and Cavallini. Dubail also asked
</p>
<p>leave to prosecute Loustalot.
</p>
<p>The hour this happened in the Chamber of Deputies, Cail-
</p>
<p>laux was at Mamers, presiding at a lecture on the origin of
</p>
<p>the war. From the platform he was called to the telephone.
</p>
<p>"General Dubail has asked the Chamber that your parlia-
</p>
<p>mentary immunity be waived," said the voice at the other end.
</p>
<p>"He asks the same for Loustalot, that you both may be
</p>
<p>prosecuted."
</p>
<p>Caillaux did not ask for details, but jumping into his auto-
</p>
<p>mobile he commanded the chauffeur to make all possible speed
</p>
<p>for Paris.
</p>
<p>NOTE
</p>
<p>To understand still more clearly the extraordinary power
</p>
<p>of Malvy in remaining in a Cabinet position, although all
</p>
<p>other heads of departments were constantly going and com-
</p>
<p>ing, one should examine the following list of Ministers.
</p>
<p>Here may be found the names of all the men in control
</p>
<p>of the French government both before and during the
</p>
<p>war ; and among them always in the same office, always Minis-
</p>
<p>ter of the Interior, was Louis J. Malvy. Not until we reach
</p>
<p>the Painleve Cabinet, organized more than three years after
</p>
<p>the declaration of war,do we fail to find this hitherto in-
</p>
<p>vulnerable friend of the foe.
</p>
<p>Malvy first became a Cabinet officer in 1911 under Premier
</p>
<p>Monis. Only these Cabinets which immediately preceeded or
</p>
<p>existed during the war are given. They are:

</p>
<p>"THE HALL OF LOST FOOTSTEPS".
</p>

<p>Life Behind the Iron Bars of La Sante
</p>
<p>The Chamber of Deputies is sometimes called "The Hall of
</p>
<p>Lost Footsteps." Within its portals there have been many
</p>
<p>goings and comings, many secret meetings, many whispered
</p>
<p>interviews in out of the way corners, many wires leading
</p>
<p>away to the Bourse and the financial exchanges of London,
</p>
<p>Berlin and New York, many ears listening to the voices of
</p>
<p>ambition, intrigue, avarice, deceit, corruption and treason,
</p>
<p>which are all lost to the casual visitor.
</p>
<p>Standing on the left bank of the Seine, looking across the
</p>
<p>river at the obelisk and statuted fountains of the Place de la
</p>
<p>Concorde,this fateful edifice has lifted many a man from
</p>
<p>the obscure walks of private life to places of power and fame.
</p>
<p>And it has also cast many a man down into the depths of
</p>
<p>disgrace and dishonor.
</p>
<p>In its tympanum above the twelve columns of its facade
</p>
<p>facing the river may be seen the figure of France with the
</p>
<p>Constitution, attended by Liberty, Order, Commerce, and
</p>
<p>Peace. Yet beneath these sculptured emblems, many a man
</p>
<p>has plotted to enslave liberty, to overthrow order, to destroy
</p>
<p>commerce, and to seek peace, when peace meant degredation
</p>
<p>and defeat.

</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 211
</p>
<p>Through the corridors of "The Hall of Lost Footsteps"
</p>
<p>on the day after his connections with Bolo and the Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge traitors had been revealed, Caillaux strode with a de-
</p>
<p>fiant step. Within these walls he had often parried many a
</p>
<p>thrust, overthrown many an adversary who sought to point
</p>
<p>him out as the evil genius of France, and again he came pre-
</p>
<p>pared to strike down any and all who dared stand in his way.
</p>
<p>Caillaux was still a deputy. He still represented the
</p>
<p>Department of the Sarthe. He accordingly possessed par-
</p>
<p>liamentary inimunity,and until his colleagues voted to take
</p>
<p>it away from him, he could not be prosecuted for the high
</p>
<p>crimes with which he had been charged. Among the members
</p>
<p>of the Chamber he still counted a formidable following,
</p>
<p>which he had bound to himself through all the expedients of
</p>
<p>political favor and patronage, of which he was master.
</p>
<p>Many of these satellites now gathered around and asked
</p>
<p>him if he would fight to preserve his parliamentary immunity.
</p>
<p>"No," he replied. "I want to be tried. I want justice. I
</p>
<p>wish I had been here yesterday. I would have leaped to the
</p>
<p>platform of the House and defied my accusers. As soon as
</p>
<p>I can, I will tear all these lies to tatters. I will explain every-
</p>
<p>thing."
</p>
<p>On December 22, Caillaux's opportunity came. The Cham-
</p>
<p>ber was crowded, and not a few said it made them think of
</p>
<p>the trial chamber in which his wife once sat and heard her-
</p>
<p>self called a murderess. The galleries were filled long before
</p>
<p>9 o'clock, and all chatted nervously while waiting for the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings to begin. Not a few women pressed black bordered
</p>
<p>handkerchiefs to their eyes, as they looked down on the
</p>
<p>vacant seats below, where here and there great mounds of
</p>
<p>flowers told of war and death, of those who would never more
</p>
<p>return to the seats of council.
</p>
<p>When at last President Deschanel's bell rang intense silence
</p>
<p>ensued. The only sound was the half stifled sobbing of

</p>
<p>a woman in the gallery which caused several deputies
</p>
<p>212 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>below to look up wonderingly. After M. Paisant explained
</p>
<p>the findings of the investigating committee, Deputy Lousta-
</p>
<p>lot in a faltering voice read his declaration of innocence. He
</p>
<p>was just about to sit down, when Caillaux marched in, head
</p>
<p>up, shoulders back, eyes snapping, bravely swinging one
</p>
<p>arm and carrying a bundle of documents under the other.
</p>
<p>He looked as if he burned to get into the fight, and yet when
</p>
<p>his time finally came, when at last he faced his colleagues, his
</p>
<p>voice died away and his eyes grew hollow.
</p>
<p>"Louder, louder," cried the socialist Left. The royalist
</p>
<p>Right and the Center remained absolutely silent. From the
</p>
<p>government bench Premier Clemenceau strained to hear every
</p>
<p>word. His face was as impassive as the wall behind him.
</p>
<p>After straightening out again the mass of documents be-
</p>
<p>fore him, Caillaux continued:
</p>
<p>"I know that I am not accused of having commited this
</p>
<p>offense for money. No one has spoken of Judas's thirty
</p>
<p>pieces of silver. I have been spared that humiliation. But
</p>
<p>there has been talk of disreputable combinations, of myster-
</p>
<p>ious intrigues to sever France from her Allies.
</p>
<p>"Such charges are false. With all my soul, with all my
</p>
<p>strength, with all my being I deny them."
</p>
<p>From point to point in his carefully planned defense, Cail-
</p>
<p>laux proceeded. He had soon apparently regained all his
</p>
<p>old time masterfulness. He plainly appreciated the frequent
</p>
<p>cheers from the socialist Left. He first spoke of Bolo. He
</p>
<p>admitted that he knew him, that he had breakfasted and dined
</p>
<p>with him, that he had written him letters, but it signified
</p>
<p>nothing. He said he had given money to the Bonnet Rouge,
</p>
<p>but added :
</p>
<p>"It was my duty to do so. It was before the war, when
</p>
<p>I was made the object of a campaign as terrible as the one
</p>
<p>waged against me today. I was compelled to defend my
</p>
<p>honor and the very life of the one closest me."

</p>
<p>A murmur swept over the galleries. It seemed almost
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 213
</p>
<p>ready to break forth in a storm of cheers and hisses, of
</p>
<p>praise and fury, when the speaker averted such an outburst
</p>
<p>by turning to another theme. He told of the insults, which
</p>
<p>he had suffered because of the "calumnies" heaped upon him,
</p>
<p>of attempts on his life, as the result of which his wife had
</p>
<p>become a nervous wreck. It was for this reason, and no
</p>
<p>other, he declared, that she went to Italy in 1916, and that
</p>
<p>he joined her at Monti Cafini and accompanied her to Flor-
</p>
<p>ence and Rome.
</p>
<p>Cavallini, he said, was introduced to him by Deputy
</p>
<p>Loustalot, as a man interested in a proposed Franco-Italian
</p>
<p>bank. He knew rothing of Cavallini's shadowy connections
</p>
<p>with Bolo or his crooked record of earlier days in Italy.
</p>
<p>Cavallini took a letter to Mme. Caillaux in Italy. Yes, but
</p>
<p>he thought at the time it was proper. The man had been
</p>
<p>recommended by Loustalot, and Loustalot was one of his
</p>
<p>old time and trusted friends.
</p>
<p>For everything, Caillaux had an excuse. Over the black-
</p>

</p>
<p>master of camouflage painted all the colors and shades of ex-

</p>
<p>her allies was a monstrous lie, he cried.
</p>
<p>Several deputies called attention to his pro-German record
</p>
<p>before the war. Instantly, Caillaux threw a veil of apparent-
</p>
<p>ly perfect patriotism over all his pro-German activities. He
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>"I did not favor an alliance with Germany. Not at all. I
</p>
<p>simply advocated a policy which did not completely exclude
</p>
<p>agreements on limited and clearly understood questions, a
</p>
<p>policy which looked to a friendly understanding between the
</p>
<p>Great Powers, from which might come reparation and the
</p>
<p>rule of right, for which we have been waiting since 1871.

<p>to her glory there is such keen national susceptibility, that
</p>
<p>214 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>any agreement with a country which conquered us in the past,
</p>
<p>causes thrills of horror. No matter how limited the entente
</p>
<p>may be or how honorable the agreement, this policy finds the
</p>
<p>most hostile opponents. It rests upon an old republican
</p>
<p>tradition reaching back to Gambetta, and among those who
</p>
<p>now voice it loudest is M. Clemenceau.
</p>
<p>"This policy was smashed by the events of 1914. The
</p>
<p>great war broke out. There could no longer be any philo-
</p>
<p>sophical conceptions or ideals. The patrie was in danger.
</p>
<p>The question then became one of duty.
</p>
<p>"For men in politics who are still young, ardent, active,
</p>
<p>there are several courses when placed in power. One is to
</p>
<p>watch the acts of the government and from the tribune to
</p>
<p>criticise them pitilessly. Another way is to aid with all one's
</p>
<p>strength the men who are burdened with the frightful re-
</p>
<p>sponsibilities of power. I adopted this second attitude. The
</p>
<p>only reproach that can be leveled at me is not that I talked
</p>
<p>too much, but kept my ideas too much to myself.
</p>
<p>"When events become the masters of men, is it forbidden to
</p>
<p>see, to analyse, to give advice? Is it forbidden to demand
</p>
<p>better organization in the conduct of the war, strict control
</p>
<p>and less waste of men and money? Above all, is it forbidden
</p>
<p>to discuss peace, to assert that it is not enough merely to
</p>
<p>wage war, but that we must also prepare for peace, a popular,
</p>
<p>durable, a human peace?
</p>
<p>"Cannot one even think with President Wilson upon the
</p>
<p>formula of peace without annexations, without penalizing in-
</p>
<p>demnities and with the right of peoples to dispose of their
</p>
<p>own destinies?
</p>
<p>"Because one thinks along these lines, should one be
</p>
<p>branded a 'defeatist'? The word is one of dishonor. No
</p>
<p>Frenchman ever wished for defeat. Of that I am certain. Nor
</p>
<p>is there any one and here I am speaking especially about
</p>
<p>myself who ever dreamed of breaking a French alliance in

<p>which is spontaneously admired by all democrats, who have
</p>
<p>come to understand English traditions and culture.
</p>
<p>"The word, 'defeatism' was created by those who exploit
</p>
<p>scandal, those who desire to make a religion of their idea of
</p>
<p>patriotism, a Geissler's hat before which some people, whom
</p>
<p>I know, will refuse to bow.
</p>
<p>"Yes, better be regarded as a suspect, better the road to
</p>
<p>the guillotine, than to surrender the full independence of one's
</p>
<p>personal convictions .at the command of a State religion thus
</p>
<p>recreated." (Volleys of applause from the Left)
</p>
<p>Caillaux looked up at the iron features of Clemenceau. He
</p>
<p>primed himself for one of those theatrical effects in which he
</p>
<p>had so often won success. He sought also to stir in the
</p>
<p>depths of the mind of Clemenceau the memory of the day
</p>
<p>when he also was the target of political attack and some said
</p>
<p>he would fall never to rise again.
</p>
<p>"Mr. President of the Council," said Caillaux, "permit
</p>
<p>one of your former collaborators to ask how the memory of
</p>
<p>the past affects you at this moment. Surely you remember
</p>
<p>certain tragic sessions,when you were accused of treason,
</p>
<p>when you were assailed in passionate speeches, when Deroulede
</p>
<p>sought to tear you to pieces. Do you want to resurrect an-
</p>
<p>other brand of injustice?
</p>
<p>"You honored me then by allowing me to aid you. Yes,
</p>
<p>I stood by you. Have you forgot? In those past days you
</p>
<p>evidenced a most gracious generosity. Do you wish to throw
</p>
<p>all that aside in order to make me the victim of another
</p>
<p>Dreyfus affair?
</p>
<p>"It is easy to say that the difficulties of a country, as
</p>
<p>glorious as ours, are only due to treason. But heavy is
</p>
<p>the responsibility of those who would use such an opportunity
</p>
<p>to become demogogues of evil.
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>immunity. I myself demand it of you. I want restitution be-
</p>
<p>fore a tribunal. I want justice, because of all the calumnies
</p>
<p>and all the ignomies, with which my private life has been
</p>
<p>befouled.
</p>
<p>"Far from resenting your action, I thank you, my col-
</p>
<p>leagues, and I am almost tempted to thank the Government.
</p>
<p>I demand a trial so that my voice may not be stifled by the
</p>
<p>rolling tambour of another Santerre.
</p>
<p>"I shall conclude with this warning. While engaged in the
</p>
<p>Norton affair in 1885, M. Clemenceau said, 'It is time to end
</p>
<p>this cheap play acting. When you sow dissenison among our
</p>
<p>citizens you weaken the fatherland, you open a broad road
</p>
<p>into France for the enemy.' '
</p>
<p>As Caillaux took his seat, his followers on the Left again
</p>
<p>applauded, as in the old days of Almereyda's claque. Many
</p>
<p>kept staring at Clemenceau to see if the subtle dagger of
</p>
<p>Caillaux's irony had reached the heart of the old "Tiger".
</p>
<p>But the face of the Premier remained as completely express-
</p>
<p>ionless as ever. Even when Francois Fournier called upon
</p>
<p>him to speak, he showed not the slightest evidence of emotion,
</p>
<p>as he rose and said:
</p>
<p>"I am the only one here who has not the right to reply to
</p>
<p>M. Caillaux."
</p>
<p>The Chamber voted 418 to 2 that Caillaux should stand
</p>
<p>trial.
</p>
<p>A little more than three weeks afterward, the Clemenceau
</p>
<p>government received from Secretary of State Lansing at
</p>
<p>Washington copies of Bernstorff's cablegrams to Berlin re-
</p>
<p>vealing Caillaux's cooperation with the enemy. Meantime,
</p>
<p>the Italian police had turned over to the French authorities
</p>
<p>the tell tale papers of Caillaux's secret safe in Florence. There
</p>
<p>was a hurried conference of the Cabinet, and Clemenceau's
</p>
<p>recommendation that Caillaux should immediately be placed
</p>
<p>behind prison bars was approved.

</p>
<p>Although the decision to arrest Caillaux was reached on
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 217
</p>
<p>the afternoon of January 13, it was thought wise not to put
</p>
<p>him in jail until the next morning. It was learned that he
</p>
<p>had planned a big dinner party, and as one of the Ministers
</p>
<p>at the conference said:
</p>
<p>"Let him have it. He may never have another."
</p>
<p>At 7 p. m. the warrant of arrest was delivered to the police
</p>
<p>with instructions that they should watch Caillaux's house all
</p>
<p>night and arrest him the first thing in the morning. As his
</p>
<p>guests came and went that night amid the strains of music
</p>
<p>and the sounds of song and laughter, a number of portentous
</p>
<p>figures stood guard about the place. But Caillaux's guests
</p>
<p>enjoyed the dinner toe much to notice anything else.
</p>
<p>Next morning at eight Police Commissary Priolet and a
</p>
<p>number of other officers in a heavy motor car drew up before
</p>
<p>the Caillaux home at No. 22 Rue Alphonse de Neuville. The
</p>
<p>big windows were closed and barred. There was not a sign of
</p>
<p>life within.
</p>
<p>"Quite a dinner they had last night," remarked Priolet, as
</p>
<p>he rang for admission. Obtaining no response, the officers
</p>
<p>began knocking against the heavy doors of the entrance and
</p>
<p>finally they brought a timid maid into view. "Go way, go
</p>
<p>way," she exclaimed with all the necessary indignation of a
</p>
<p>well trained servant. "Go way, M. Caillaux is still in bed."
</p>
<p>"Please tell M. Caillaux," replied the Police Commissary,
</p>
<p>"that he is under arrest."
</p>
<p>The half fainting maid took the message upstairs, and on
</p>
<p>returning she most graciously invited the officers in. They
</p>
<p>waited and waited. Caillaux insisted on taking his customary
</p>
<p>bath and massage and have his valet shave and dress him. He
</p>
<p>insisted on every exquisite detail before be judged his toilette
</p>
<p>complete. Meantime, Mme. Caillaux entertained the officers
</p>
<p>in the sumptuous drawing room. It was not until 9.45 a. m.
</p>
<p>that the master of the house presented himself to the police,
</p>
<p>his valet behind him carrying a beautiful seal skin overcoat.

</p>
<p>His protest against arrest was perfunctory. A moment
</p>
<p>218 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>later he was seated in the police automobile and driving down
</p>
<p>the Avenue de Wagram toward the Arc de Triomphe, at the
</p>
<p>Etoile, from which nine of the greatest avenues and boule-
</p>
<p>vards of Paris radiate in all directions. He chatted grac-
</p>
<p>iously with the officers until circling the great arch. Then
</p>
<p>he became suddenly silent. Whether or not this mighty em-
</p>
<p>blem of the military power of France made him think of all
</p>
<p>he had done to bring dishonor and defeat upon his country,
</p>
<p>none of his fellow passengers knew.
</p>
<p>As he crossed the Seine he could not help see in the dis-
</p>
<p>tance the island of the Cite and the towers of Notre Dame.
</p>
<p>It was on that island that his wife had once been imprisoned
</p>
<p>in the Conciergerie during her trial for murder. At last the
</p>
<p>automobile turned into the Boulevard Arago and stopped
</p>
<p>within the shadow of the Prison de la Sante. Hither his
</p>
<p>wife had first been brought on the night of Calmette's death.
</p>
<p>Escorted by Commissary Priolct and followed by three
</p>
<p>inspectors, the former Premier of France entered the wide
</p>
<p>entrance of the city jail, a prisoner. At first he assumed the
</p>
<p>air of a man who could not bend, who was still above the law.
</p>
<p>As soon as he reached the office of the Director, M. Dabat, he
</p>
<p>sought to greet this official as if he were some old associate
</p>
<p>in the Chamber of Deputies.
</p>
<p>"Ah, Good Morning, M. Dabat," he said smilingly. "I
</p>
<p>want to ask you a question. I am under arrest. That is
</p>
<p>understood. But I trust you will not treat me as an ordinary
</p>
<p>prisoner, charged with the violation of the criminal law."
</p>
<p>"I have received no orders to the contrary," replied M.
</p>
<p>Dabat. "I will see." Having telephoned to the Ministry of
</p>
<p>Justice, M. Dabat finally replied that he had been authorized
</p>
<p>to treat Caillaux as a political prisoner.
</p>
<p>"You may have two mattresses instead of one," he said.
</p>
<p>"Also two bed covers and a table. Such things the ordinary
</p>
<p>inmates do not have. You will be placed in the Eleventh

<p>Division. I will see that the extra furniture is taken to your

</p>
<p>cell immediately." Turning to Commissary Priolet, the Dir-
</p>
<p>ector added:
</p>
<p>"Please take the gentleman now to the Recorder's Office."
</p>
<p>There a secretary took the warrant, inspected the sign-
</p>
<p>ature of Captain Bouchardon with which it was counter-
</p>
<p>signed, and asked:
</p>
<p>"Are you Caillaux, Joseph Caillaux, born at Mans, on
</p>
<p>March 30, 1863, the person named in this warrant?"
</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Caillaux, and in answer to many more ques-
</p>
<p>tions he finally gave all the details of his pedigree, like an
</p>
<p>ordinary criminal. As he began to realize how far he had
</p>
<p>fallen, he lost his former appearance of good humor, and
</p>
<p>when at last, he was asked to press his finger tips on an ink
</p>
<p>pad, he drew back defiantly.
</p>
<p>"Your finger prints, please. The rules compel this form-
</p>
<p>ality," was the almost apologetic explanation. Swallowing
</p>
<p>the lump in his throat, Caillaux submitted to the ordeal, and
</p>
<p>the prints of the fingers of both hands were recorded on the
</p>
<p>pedigree card. This done, he was led to the Department of
</p>
<p>Personal Inspection. With a special card, which he had just
</p>
<p>received,giving his cell number and name, Caillaux entered a
</p>
<p>room, where three policemen were searching a line of prison-
</p>
<p>ers. The sight made him recoil, and he was about to step
</p>
<p>back into the hall, when one of the policemen said gruffly :
</p>
<p>"Here, here. Wait your turn."
</p>
<p>Caillaux held out his card. The policeman looked, and in-
</p>
<p>stantly he was all deference.
</p>
<p>"WTiat, Joseph Caillaux?" he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>"Yes."
</p>
<p>The other policeman looked at the card. They whispered
</p>
<p>to each other a moment. Then one said in a low voice:
</p>
<p>"Empty your pockets, if you please. It is the rule."
</p>
<p>The blood mounted to his temples, as he obeyed. On the

</p>
<p>knife, keys, and a pocketbook, which one policeman opened
</p>
<p>as he announced:
</p>
<p>"Six thousand francs".
</p>
<p>With a few books including love poems and novels, he was
</p>
<p>taken to Cell No. 17. A naval quarter master, who had been
</p>
<p>wounded in a sea disaster, was already there to act as attend-
</p>
<p>ant as well as keeper. "Peyrebrune," he answered, when
</p>
<p>Caillaux asked his name.
</p>
<p>In Cell 17 Caillaux proceeded to make himself at home. His
</p>
<p>old time self possession returned. Also his appetite. He
</p>
<p>ordered a plate of bouillon, two eggs and a half bottle of
</p>
<p>Bordeaux for luncheon, and another plate of bouillon, chicken
</p>
<p>and rice, and another half bottle of Bordeaux for dinner.
</p>
<p>During the afternoon he confered with M. Demange, his at-
</p>
<p>torney, in the reception room. In the evening he read and
</p>
<p>wrote until 11 o'clock, and then gave orders to be awakened
</p>
<p>at 6 in the morning. His keeper smiled.
</p>
<p>"We all get up pretty early here," he replied.
</p>
<p>"And this is the Eleventh Division?" queried Caillaux for
</p>
<p>lack of another question.
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," responded the keeper. "It is specially guarded.

<p>To Save Him Bolo's End
</p>
<p>Of Caillaux's prison associates, Bolo was the first to be
</p>
<p>brought to trial. On February 4, 1918, he was taken before
</p>
<p>the court martial of the Third Council of War. His easy,
</p>
<p>gracious manner, his pleasant words for everyone, made him
</p>
<p>appear the least concerned of all the court room. His ele-
</p>
<p>gantly tailored costume, his glossy hair and moustache, his
</p>
<p>jaunty monocle, hardly permitted one to think he had been
</p>
<p>living for the last five months in the city jail. Indeed, he
</p>
<p>looked as if he had been the host at one of his famous ban-
</p>
<p>quets in an adjoining room, and had just dropped in to meet
</p>
<p>some more old friends.
</p>
<p>The chamber was filled with a far different crowd than
</p>
<p>witnessed the trial of Mme. Caillaux. Two-thirds of the
</p>
<p>women were garmented in black. Nearly all the men among
</p>
<p>the spectators were aged or crippled. Upon the whole scene
</p>
<p>fell the shadow of suffering and death. The spectre of war
</p>
<p>haunted everything. Almost continually one could hear the
</p>
<p>far off rumble of guns at the front or the throbbing roar of
</p>
<p>aeroplane sentries overhead.

<p>Beside Bolo sat Porchere, accused of having been a go-

</p>
<p>between in one of Bolo's treason plots. Formerly an attor-
</p>
<p>ney at Oran, he later became vice-president of the Senate.
</p>
<p>Although the charge of treason also implicated Cavallini, the
</p>
<p>Italian co-defendant was not there. And for good cause.
</p>
<p>Just at that time he was languishing behind the bars of an
</p>
<p>Italian prison, accused of having betrayed Italy also to the
</p>
<p>enemy.
</p>
<p>Against Bolo, there were two charges of treason. First,
</p>
<p>he had conspired with Abbas Hilmi in Switzerland to aid the
</p>
<p>foe. Second, he had received from Cavallini in Paris 1,000,-
</p>
<p>000 francs of German money for pacifist propaganda in
</p>
<p>France.
</p>
<p>As near Bolo as she could approach sat his wife. Frequent-
</p>
<p>ly, she hid her tear dimmed eyes in her handkerchief. When
</p>
<p>her husband had entered the courtroom, she had thrown her-
</p>
<p>self into his arms, and at first she almost fought against
</p>
<p>being taken out of his embrace. And as she now gazed at
</p>
<p>him through her tears she showed how she still clung to him,
</p>
<p>still believed in him.
</p>
<p>Further away there lurked two other women. Bolo had
</p>
<p>caught sight of them early, and he made every effort to avoid
</p>
<p>seeing them again. He well knew the stories that they had
</p>
<p>been summoned to tell, stories of his old wild life, stories that
</p>
<p>would reveal in him all that was base and perfidious. They
</p>
<p>were his other "wives".

</p>
<p>train of other witnesses had testified to Bolo's adventures,
</p>
<p>intrigues, and crimes, these two other women were called to
</p>
<p>the stand.
</p>
<p>The first made Mine. Bolo almost swoon from her chair.
</p>
<p>It was Mme. Mathilde Panon, Bolo's first woman victim, a
</p>
<p>poor, thin, feeble creature, almost blind, her voice hardly
</p>
<p>more than a hoarse whisper, her lips, white as in death. As
</p>
<p>bhe tottered along, her face uplifted, her almost sightless
</p>
<p>eyes half closed, she seemed a sort of wraith, which had come
</p>
<p>up out of his evil past to mock him.
</p>
<p>"Before knowing M. Bolo," she began tremulously, "my
</p>
<p>husband and I were very happy. When Bolo came, that
</p>
<p>happiness vanished. A few months later, I was lost. I be-
</p>
<p>lieved in his love. I gave up everything for him.
</p>
<p>"One day, after a serious illness, he told me that my
</p>
<p>husband was about to be declared a bankrupt, that there was
</p>
<p>only one thing to do, and that was to elope. I was demented.
</p>
<p>I cannot, cannot tell you my emotions that day. I was con-
</p>
<p>sumed with a ravaging passion. I consented to flee with him.
</p>
<p>I abandoned my husband, who had worshiped me. I aband-
</p>
<p>oned my mother, my country, everything, for him."
</p>
<p>The ghostlike face looked blankly at Bolo, who buried his
</p>
<p>head in his hands and began sobbing like a child. Mme. Bolo
</p>
<p>tried to reach out her arms to comfort him, but her strength
</p>
<p>failed her.
</p>
<p>"I carried away with me my jewels, some of which were
</p>
<p>very beautiful, very costly. Most of them were a present
</p>
<p>from my aunt, who loved me very dearly. I also took a few
</p>
<p>thousand francs.
</p>
<p>"A few days later, I fell ill at Barcelona. Bolo took me
</p>
<p>to Valencia, where M. Pollis, the French consul, took pity on
</p>
<p>me and found some pupils for me. I taught elocution. But
</p>
<p>I could not earn money enough for Bolo. He began to sell
</p>
<p>my jewels. M. Pollis told Bolo he would have to leave. We

<p>returned to Paris in distress. My last jewels were disappear-

</p>
<p>ing rapidly. I was still ill. In Paris I suffered the agonies
</p>
<p>of both soul and body. At last I could not stand it any
</p>
<p>longer. I went back to my husband. I beseeched him to
</p>
<p>save my life, to take me into his arms once more. And at
</p>
<p>last, at last, he forgave me."
</p>
<p>The whispering voice became a sob. The pallid face grew
</p>
<p>still whiter. The thin fingers twitched convulsively. Not
</p>
<p>until Lt. Hornet's kindly voice reasured her, was she able to
</p>
<p>continue. Finally she said:
</p>
<p>"I began to work with all my soul, with all my energy, to
</p>
<p>deserve my husband's pardon, to prove to my mother that I
</p>
<p>was sincerely repentant. And happiness came again. Oh, it
</p>
<p>was so sweet, so sweet after such agony. But it could not
</p>
<p>last. Bolo came again. He talked with my husband. He
</p>
<p>was so kind, so apparently anxious to regain favor, that he
</p>
<p>tempted my husband into another venture, in which we lost
</p>
<p>everything. Oh, God, why did this evil being ever cross my
</p>
<p>path?"
</p>
<p>Colonel Voyer bent forward sympathetically, and asked :
</p>
<p>"Do you recognize the accused as the Bolo that you knew?"
</p>
<p>Mme. Panon turned her face again toward the prisoner,
</p>
<p>who at the command of the court, threw back his shoulders
</p>
<p>and stared straight ahead. His face had become a death
</p>
<p>mask.
</p>
<p>"No, no," faltered the poor woman. "I am blind."
</p>
<p>Mme. Bolo kept her face hid in her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>Panon, the husband, also told his story. His hesitant
</p>
<p>manner, his softness of voice revealed the kind of man, who
</p>
<p>forgives because of weakness rather than of charity. He
</p>
<p>explained how he had been twice deceived. After Bolo had
</p>
<p>seen Pavenstedt and opened a new stream of riches, Panon
</p>
<p>believed that his former partner's character had changed for
</p>
<p>the better, the same as his fortune.
</p>
<p>"In March, 1917," said Panon, "Bolo asked me to go to

</p>
<p>panj r , how his account stood. He wanted a statement up to
</p>
<p>February, 1917. Pavenstedt refused. He told me to break
</p>
<p>away from Bolo. When I got back to France I was poorer
</p>
<p>than ever. The 1.0,000 francs, Bolo gave me, were almost
</p>
<p>all gone. I was ruined."
</p>
<p>Panon's testimony aroused Bolo into a fury.
</p>
<p>"Panon is a liar. Panon is the traitor. Pavenstedt bribed
</p>
<p>him," he cried.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile a younger, fairer woman was waiting to tell her
</p>
<p>story of the Levantine charmer. She was Mme. Henriette
</p>
<p>Soumaille, the opera singer with whom he had voyaged to
</p>
<p>South America, whom he had finally married and then aband-
</p>
<p>oned for the Mme. Bolo, who now sat near him. When she
</p>
<p>finally took the stand and lifted her veil, her features ap-
</p>
<p>peared to have almost completely escaped the imprint of ill
</p>
<p>fortune. Indeed, the shadow of a smile smoothed away what
</p>
<p>few wrinkles she had. It was the smile of one who is happy
</p>
<p>in not having suffered more.
</p>
<p>Mme. Soumaille told of her tempestuous experiences in
</p>
<p>South America, how Bolo kept spending her money, and how,
</p>
<p>when the cash came too slow, mysterious burglars broke into
</p>
<p>her apartment and took her jewels As her memories of the
</p>
<p>past became more vivid her emotions became more and more
</p>
<p>aroused.
</p>
<p>"After we separated, I tried to divorce him, but could not,
</p>
<p>because I could not find him," she continued. "I laid the case
</p>
<p>before a lawyer in Nice.
</p>
<p>"The attorney exclaimed:
</p>
<p>" 'Why, I know him. He is rich. He is married to
</p>
<p>"'Married'? I said. 'Married? Then it cannot be my
</p>
<p>Bolo. He could not have committed such a crime as that.'
</p>
<p>A titter ran through the court room.
</p>
<p>"My lawyer investigated," resumed Mme. Soumaille, "He
</p>
<p>found that the millionaire Bolo was my Bolo. Some time

</p>
<p>later I saw in a newspaper, 'M. and Mme. Paul Bolo, Hotel
</p>
<p>226 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>Ruth'. I went to the hotel and inquired. They said Bolo
</p>
<p>Pacha was stopping there.
</p>
<p>"I let some days go by, and then I went to Bolo's home
</p>
<p>in the Rue de Phalsbourg. I stood in front of the door for
</p>
<p>five minutes, before I had courage enough to ring. At last
</p>
<p>I did, and a servant came.
</p>
<p>" 'Is M. Bolo in?' I asked. 'Yes, he replied. Who shall
</p>
<p>I say is calling?' 'It is not necessary to give my name. He
</p>
<p>does not know me,' I answered."
</p>
<p>As soon as Mme. Soumaille began her testimony, Mme.
</p>
<p>Bolo looked at her with mingled expressions of scorn and
</p>
<p>contempt. The faithful wife seemed to have forgotten all
</p>
<p>that was ever ill about her beloved husband, who had also
</p>
<p>recovered his good humor and returned his wife's imploring
</p>
<p>looks with apparently the happiest of smiles.
</p>
<p>" 'As I entered the salon through one door," continued
</p>
<p>the first Mme. Bolo, "my husband came in another. He had
</p>
<p>no time to say he could not receive me. He greeted me and
</p>
<p>showed me a big arm chair, with the words :
</p>
<p>" 'What do you wish, madam?'
</p>
<p>" 'Do you not recognize me?' I asked. 'Must I announce
</p>
<p>myself ?'
</p>
<p>" 'No, if you please, no, not here.'
</p>
<p>" 'What do you mean, not here ? I want to talk things
</p>
<p>over, and then I want a divorce.'
</p>
<p>" 'No, not here. I will meet you outside, any place you
</p>
<p>say, but not here. My wife is likely to come in at
</p>
<p>"'Your wife?' I cried. 'What do you mean by your
</p>
<p>wife. I am your wife. You married me and you are still
</p>
<p>married to me.'
</p>
<p>"Then the other woman came, and asked me who I was. I
</p>
<p>replied, 'Ask Monsieur.'
</p>
<p>" 'Since it is necessary to speak,' he said at last, 'I will
</p>
<p>tell you. The madame there twenty years ago at Buenos

</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 227
</p>
<p>" 'She is yet, sir,' I said.
</p>
<p>"They both began to talk at the same time, and tjien they
</p>
<p>came to me and besought me not to cause a scandal. Bolo
</p>
<p>said he would see me again the next day at the Grand Hotel.
</p>
<p>There, again, he begged me not to make a scandal. He said
</p>
<p>I could have no interest in ruining him. He said he would
</p>
<p>indemnify me for all that I had suffered, morally and mater-
</p>
<p>ially, and I accepted.
</p>
<p>"He gave me 25.000 francs and promised an income of
</p>
<p>20,000 francs a year. I wanted it attested by a notary, but
</p>
<p>he said it was not necessary.
</p>
<p>"Last June there were whisperings about him, and I went
</p>
<p>to him and said, 'Monsieur, I do not wish to wait longer. I
</p>
<p>Want a divorce.' He replied, 'I shall go to Nice in December
</p>
<p>as quietly as I can, and establish a domicile there. Then
</p>
<p>you can sue me, and we shall be divorced.'
</p>
<p>"Later I became worried again and went to see him. He
</p>
<p>said, 'Why do you keep bothering me. I will give you 50,000
</p>
<p>francs, if you will stop.' I accepted."
</p>
<p>Mme. Soumaille nearly fainted several times, as she dwelt
</p>
<p>more and more on the details of her sufferings. Finally, the
</p>
<p>windows of the court room were ordered thrown open. As
</p>
<p>she left the stand she almost fell. Bolo again buried his
</p>
<p>head in his hands, and when he lifted his face his cheeks were
</p>
<p>wet with tears. He was an utterly different Bolo from the
</p>
<p>Bolo on the witness stand. Then, confronted by the belliger-
</p>
<p>ant Lt. Mornet, he was supremely self possessed. Always
</p>
<p>on guard, he met attack with all the weapons of dissimulation.
</p>
<p>His smiles, his sneers, his gestures of defiance or contempt
</p>
<p>were perfect camouflage.
</p>
<p>And now came the last Mme. Bolo to the stand. The
</p>
<p>crowd tried hard to see her face, but the broad brim of her
</p>
<p>picture hat cast too dark a shadow. She appeared to b
</p>
<p>more .resolute, more self possessed, than the women who prt-

</p>
<p>theatres, but a life of wealth, the adulation of fair weather
</p>
<p>friends, the servility of servants, the hypocrisy of society,
</p>
<p>had given her a false poise and an affected bearing, which
</p>
<p>at this critical time did not desert her. She vigorously
</p>
<p>denied that Bolo had dissipated her fortune. Instead, she
</p>
<p>said, he had increased it.
</p>
<p>"He has been a model husband," she said. "He worked
</p>
<p>hard. He always attended to my comfort. He was most
</p>
<p>regular in his habits. He rose every morning at seven. He
</p>
<p>received visitors at nine. He went to business as soon as
</p>
<p>disengaged, and returned home at noon for dejeuner. Later
</p>
<p>he would leave the house for various business engagements.
</p>
<p>At night he never went out without me. He never accepted
</p>
<p>a dinner engagement alone."
</p>
<p>Mme. Bolo's unstinted praise was in answer to questions
</p>
<p>asked by Albert Salle, Bolo's attorney.
</p>
<p>Among all other witnesses, none was awaited with more
</p>
<p>straining of necks, more excited whisperings, than Joseph
</p>
<p>Caillaux. At last he pushed his way toward the stand through
</p>
<p>a surging crowd of spectators. His alert and sure step,
</p>
<p>his vigilant eyes, seeking ever to dominate those that met
</p>
<p>them, indicated that he had lost none of his old time faith
</p>
<p>in his own fortunes.
</p>
<p>"What is your name?" he was asked.
</p>
<p>"Joseph-Pierre-Marie- Auguste Caillaux."
</p>
<p>"Your profession?"
</p>
<p>"Deputy, President of the Council General of the Sarthe."
</p>
<p>"Your residence?"
</p>
<p>And without the least hesitation or the slightest evidence
</p>
<p>of feeling, he replied:
</p>
<p>"La Sante prison."
</p>
<p>Caillaux admitted he had been on good terms with Bolo.
</p>
<p>His defense was much the same as in the Chamber. When
</p>
<p>asked why he had written Bolo to see him upon the latter's

<p>return from America, he replied :
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 229
</p>
<p>"I was anxious to know if he had any definite idea of the
</p>
<p>success of the two canditates for the Presidency of the
</p>
<p>United States. As a statesman I was naturally interested.
</p>
<p>For my part, I was willing to see M. Wilson victorious. I
</p>
<p>knew that his candidacy was the best thing for France. M.
</p>
<p>Hughes, on the contrary, had aroused my suspicions, because
</p>
<p>he was supported by Wall Street."
</p>
<p>M. Cassclla, the Swiss correspondent of Le Matin, told of
</p>
<p>his work as an investigator, in following all the labyrinthine
</p>
<p>movements of Bolo and his fellow conspirators from rendez-
</p>
<p>vous to rendezvous, hotel to hotel, train to train. Indeed, it
</p>
<p>was M. Casella, who furnished the first proof of the Levan-
</p>
<p>tine's guilt.
</p>
<p>"German propaganda in Switzerland," he said, "plans to
</p>
<p>overthrow the whole world. From Switzerland the Germans
</p>
<p>are launching a Maximalist movement in all the Allied coun-
</p>
<p>tries. Those who have lent themselves to this propaganda
</p>
<p>are traitors more miserable than the spies at the front. They
</p>
<p>are ten times more abominable, than the perfidious cowards
</p>
<p>who turn their backs to the enemy."
</p>
<p>.Charles Humbert told of his dealings with Bolo, and in-
</p>
<p>sisted that he had not the slightest idea of the German
</p>
<p>source of Bolo's millions. He said that Bolo's check was on
</p>
<p>the Bank Perier. When he learned of Bolo's guilt, he said he
</p>
<p>reimbursed him. "Not one cent of Bolo's money ever entered
</p>
<p>the 'Journal'," he testified. "It passed from America to the
</p>
<p>Perier Bank, and thence to my attorney, McAndouin, who
</p>
<p>gave it to McBrunet, legal adviser of Pierre Lenoir."
</p>
<p>Lenoir's connections with the enemy were revealed in a
</p>
<p>later trial in which with Humbert and Desouches, Humbert's
</p>
<p>other associate in the Journal, he was accused of treason
</p>
<p>like that of Bolo. (See Chapter XXI.)
</p>
<p>And now among the last witnesses there appeared a man
</p>
<p>in clerical garb and studentical manner, whose severe face

</p>
<p>some of his graver moods. Years before, when Bolo Pacha
</p>
<p>was nearly arrested for some youthful prank, and this ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastic had not yet entered the church, the latter said to
</p>
<p>the former:
</p>
<p>"Paul, unless you remember that you are responsible to
</p>
<p>God for all you do, you shall surely meet punishment at his
</p>
<p>hands."
</p>
<p>"There is no God," was the reply.
</p>
<p>At last these same two were brought face to face again.
</p>
<p>And again each must have thought of those words of earnest
</p>
<p>warning and truthful prophecy. For the two men were
</p>
<p>brothers. One had followed the broad ; the other the narrow
</p>
<p>path of life. The man in black took the stand, and said he
</p>
<p>was Monsignor Bolo. He had come to save his brother's
</p>
<p>life. He refused to believe any of the charges against him.
</p>
<p>He simply knew that his brother must be innocent, that he
</p>
<p>could not have stooped so low. Even when confronted with
</p>
<p>the blackest proof, he shook his head. "Impossible," he
</p>
<p>said. He spoke proudly of the patriotism of the Bolo family.
</p>
<p>He told how he, himself, despite his grey hair, had volunteered
</p>
<p>to fight for his country at the first news of the German
</p>
<p>invasion.
</p>
<p>"I forgot my age," he cried. "I wanted to do my duty.
</p>
<p>I went to the front. The only reason I am here now, is be-
</p>
<p>cause I had to come back ill and lame."
</p>
<p>But the pleadings of the faithful brother were of no avail.
</p>
<p>On February 14, 1918, Bolo Pacha and Cavallini were sen-
</p>
<p>tenced to death. Porchere was condemned to three years im-
</p>
<p>prisonment.

</p>
<p>A little more than two months later, on April 29, 1918,
</p>
<p>the Bonnet Rouge gang was taken from "La Sante" and
</p>
<p>arraigned before the Third Council of War. Into the court
</p>
<p>martial chamber they came, one by one, Duval, Marion,
</p>
<p>Joucla, Landau, Goldsky. With them were also brought to
</p>
<p>trial, Leymarie, Malvy's aide, and Vercasson, Duval's mes-
</p>
<p>senger. The accused looked haggard and worn. The ex-
</p>
<p>ecution of Bolo less than two weeks before still lay heavily
</p>
<p>upon their minds. Nor had they forgotten the tragic fate
</p>
<p>of Almereyda.
</p>
<p>Lt. Mornet, even more bearded and shaggy than ever, con-
</p>
<p>ducted the prosecution. Captain Bouchardon's report re-
</p>
<p>vealing all the varied treacheries of Duval and his associates,
</p>
<p>of which we are already familiar, was read into the record.
</p>
<p>A multitude of witnesses followed, and then the prosecutor
</p>
<p>summed up the whole story of the treason of these men in one
</p>
<p>of the most eloquent discourses, ever heard in a French
</p>
<p>court.

</p>
<p>throughout France, Lt. Mornet continued:
</p>
<p>232 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"Since it was treason, which was to be accomplished
</p>
<p>through a press campaign, a newspaper was needed, that had
</p>
<p>already been established, a ground, already prepared, a
</p>
<p>house already furnished. A staff of men was wanted, whose
</p>
<p>past would be a security for the evil work expected of them.
</p>
<p>It was also necessary to have an organizer and intermediary
</p>
<p>to bring all these forces in touch with the directing power of
</p>
<p>the enemy.
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, they found this organizer, this intermediary,
</p>
<p>in the person of a very obscure man, M. Duval. In the San
</p>
<p>Stefano affair Duval's business relations with Germans had
</p>
<p>been perfectly legal, but when he continued these assoc-
</p>
<p>iations after September, 1914, the date when all economic
</p>
<p>relations with the subjects of the Central Empires were pro-
</p>
<p>hibited, his acts fell under the penalty of the law.
</p>
<p>"Out of a comparatively trifling transaction with the
</p>
<p>enemy, this treason plot, so far as it concerns Duval, was
</p>
<p>born. If you consider this fact, you will at once realize why
</p>
<p>it was necessary to pass the later law of 1915, which made it
</p>
<p>an offense even to talk with the enemy upon an economic

<p>"Experience had demonstrated that nearly always these

<p>conversations, at first of a purely personal character, led

<p>sooner or later to affairs of treason. So it was that by talk-

<p>ing of the San Stefano company with the German Marx,
</p>
<p>Duval was prompted to talk about the war. They regretted
</p>
<p>the war. They regretted the catastrophy, and perhaps the
</p>
<p>German regretted it more vehemently than did the French-

</p>
<p>"I shall now get into the heart of the prosecution, and
</p>
<p>show you that in the 'Bonnet Rouge' a house was found al-
</p>
<p>ready furnished. We will see what this house is.
</p>
<p>"The 'Bonnet Rouge" had been founded in 1913. Its pro-
</p>
<p>grame may be found in a great poster, which I shall ask the
</p>
<p>Court Recorder to show you. It dates back to 1913, before
</p>
<p>the war, but it is typical. I quote its title :
</p>
<p>" 'The Franco-German re-approachment.'
</p>
<p>"In those words you have the whole programme.
</p>
<p>"The director of the 'Bonnet Rouge' was Almereyda. There
</p>
<p>has been a great deal said of this man during the trial. Al-
</p>
<p>mereyda was still a young man, and yet he possessed a crim-
</p>
<p>inal record adorned with six convictions.
</p>
<p>"I am obliged to state that an important political person-
</p>
<p>age, M. Caillaux, former President of the Council, paid on
</p>
<p>July 17, 1914, the sum of 40,000 francs to the 'Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge'. The receipt is one of the exhibits of this case. At
</p>
<p>the beginning of 1914 there was a tragedy enacted which
</p>
<p>you remember, the assassination of M. Calmette by Mme.
</p>
<p>Caillaux. The 'Bonnet Rouge', in the person of Almereyda,
</p>
<p>made a most violent crusade in favor of Mme. Caillaux, even
</p>
<p>going so far as to praise the crime.
</p>
<p>"Almereyda's efforts in behalf of M. Caillaux also extend-
</p>
<p>ed outside of this newspaper. Proof is to be found in this
</p>
<p>extremely interesting report, signed by the Prefect of Police,
</p>
<p>himself. It reads:
</p>
<p>" 'My attention has been called to a certain number of
</p>
<p>persons who constitute a sort of claque, whose duty it is to
</p>
<p>start agitations in behalf of M. Caillaux and against his ad-
</p>
<p>versaries. This group, familiarly called, "The Corsican
</p>
<p>Guard", was organized during the Caillaux-Calmette trial,
</p>
<p>in July, 1914. "The Corsican Guard" was recruited by
</p>
<p>Almereyda, assisted by Napoleon Poggiale, Poggia Roch,
</p>
<p>Tavera, called the Assassin, Filippi, called Pasquale, all nat-

<p>ives of Corsica,
</p>
<p>234 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>" 'Every morning before the audience, Almereyda used
</p>
<p>to gather these men and other acolytes in a cafe at the
</p>
<p>Chatelet, and give them admission cards to the court room.
</p>
<p>It has been proved that they had agreed to try to provoke
</p>
<p>during the sessions of the court, manifestations favorable to
</p>
<p>the accused or her husband and hostile to the witness for
</p>
<p>the state and the prosecution.
</p>
<p>" 'At the adjournment of the session, they would escort M.
</p>
<p>Caillaux under the pretext of protecting him.
</p>
<p>" 'All these individuals were dangerous criminals and in-
</p>
<p>ternational bandits. Their leaders, Poggia Roch and Nap-
</p>
<p>oleon Poggiale have not incured less than twelve convictions.
</p>
<p>Still another has six convictions to his credit, chiefly for
</p>
<p>murder and arson: Tavera, called the Assassin, is a crook,
</p>
<p>living on various devices including the exploitation of gam-
</p>
<p>bling places. He has been convicted six times. Once he was
</p>
<p>sentenced to five years by the Assizes Court of Corsica. Filip-
</p>
<p>pi has not incurred less than 12 convictions, chiefly for
</p>
<p>thefts.'
</p>
<p>"Then came the war. Almereyda, following his fantastic
</p>
<p>career, began to exert his influence upon the Minister of the
</p>
<p>Interior. I do not exaggerate in the slightest, when I say
</p>
<p>that this man, who has been condemned six times, and organ-
</p>
<p>ized the 'Corsican Guard', became the real prefect of police.
</p>
<p>"The proof is to be found in a series of papers on file here,
</p>
<p>sent by Almereyda to the Prefecture of Police through the
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior, and which contain orders to set
</p>
<p>free a long list of foreigners, interned in concentration camps.
</p>
<p>"In the very beginning Almereyda maintained a correct at-
</p>
<p>itude. We must give what credit is due him. Almereyda was
</p>
<p>boiling. He had hot blood, and perhaps, in the contagion
</p>
<p>of enthusiasm during the first days of the war, Almereyda
</p>
<p>was sincere, and under the impulse of his violent temperment
</p>
<p>dashed into a short, patriotic campaign.

<p>"But in a note, which we have here in the files, Almereyda
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 235
</p>
<p>explains that his ideas experienced an evolution. Moments
</p>
<p>of enthusiasm are of short duration in a rascal. Almereyda
</p>
<p>was not long in cooling off.
</p>
<p>"By the end of 1915, one could see in the "Bonnet Rouge*
</p>
<p>a. propaganda favorable to the doctrines of Zimmerwald and
</p>
<p>Kienthal. The 'Bonnet Rouge' is perhaps the only organ of
</p>
<p>the French press, which published such articles at that time.
</p>
<p>It als0 applauded Remain Roland because, Gentlemen, in
</p>
<p>1915, the heart of the 'Bonnet Rouge' had already ceased to
</p>
<p>beat in unison with that of France.
</p>
<p>"There is another phase of this matter, which is almost too
</p>
<p>evil to contemplate, but of which I must speak.
</p>
<p>"Several times every week, you must have seen an article in
</p>
<p>the 'Bonnet Rouge', which was always of the same tenor. It
</p>
<p>told, for example, how husbands were deceived, how soldiers
</p>
<p>on furloughs discovered that their wives at home were un-
</p>
<p>faithful.
</p>
<p>"Turn the pages of the 'Bonnet Rouge\ and you will be-
</p>
<p>come sick with disgust. You will see that its editors made
</p>
<p>every insidious effort to create a jealous fear in the mind of
</p>
<p>every soldier who left a wife at home, demoralizing him,
</p>
<p>drawing his mind away from discipline and duty.
</p>
<p>"Look at the pictures in the 'Bonnet Rouge'. Read the
</p>
<p>captions, 'The Ardent Patriot', 'Mimi's Mattress', and so
</p>
<p>forth.
</p>
<p>"From 1916 on we see Almereyda in touch with all the
</p>
<p>pacifist groups. One of them, by the way, had quite an
</p>
<p>ephemeral existence. I speak of the Poinsot group. Poinsot
</p>
<p>had seen M. Caillaux, and he wrote to Almereyda on June 1,
</p>
<p>1916:
</p>
<p>" 'Everything has been obtained for us. All we need is
</p>
<p>that the censorship will allow us the right to discuss in the
</p>
<p>newspapers the problem of peace.'
</p>
<p>"Poinsot, however, was far less dangerous than some other

</p>
<p>example, one of his associates was Hartmann, Hartmann,
</p>
<p>whose home was a veritable center of international treason,
</p>
<p>Hartmann, who at present is being prosecuted in Paris for
</p>
<p>'intelligence with the enemy'. We find Hartman, writing this
</p>
<p>letter to Almereyda:
</p>
<p>" 'I thank you for sending me your newspaper, and I take
</p>
<p>the liberty to compliment you upon its correct attitude.'
</p>
<p>"We discover Almereyda also in close communion with
</p>
<p>Guilbeaux, Guilbeaux, whom the 'Bonnet Rouge' supported
</p>
<p>in protesting against the interdiction of the review Demain
</p>
<p>(Tomorrow), the official organ of Leninism and Bolshevism.
</p>
<p>Listen to this letter, which Guilbeaux has written to Captain
</p>
<p>Bouchardon, because, I was forgetting to tell you, Guilbeaux
</p>
<p>is also being prosecuted for 'intelligence with the enemy'.
</p>
<p>"'Sir:
</p>
<p>" 'I learned through the papers the charges of crime
</p>
<p>against me, and the inquiry which you are making. I have

<p>the honor to inform you, that if perchance a summons were

</p>
<p>"You can see, Gentlemen, who are Almereyda's friends, who
</p>
<p>are the friends of the 'Bonnet Rouge'.
</p>
<p>"Up to this point these documents, these letters, show only
</p>
<p>the exterior work of the house. They are only a kind of a
</p>
<p>sign. We must now look within and learn whether the
</p>
<p>merchandise corresponds with the sign.
</p>
<p>"You have heard M. Marchand's testimony, that the fifteen
</p>
<p>publicity campaigns which appeared in the 'Bonnet Rouge'
</p>
<p>were also printed in the 'Gazette des Ardennes', which is not
</p>
<p>published by French traitors, like those who are editing "La
</p>
<p>Verite (The Truth), at Barccelona, but edited and pub-
</p>
<p>lished by the German Staff. I repeat it. The 'Gazette des
</p>
<p>Ardennes' is the newspaper of the German Staff, which at-
</p>
<p>tempts no camouflage whatever, but says:
</p>
<p>" 'We are printing a newspaper in French for the benefit
</p>
<p>of the French population whose territory we are occupying.'
</p>
<p>"And this is the only newspaper which our unfortunate
</p>
<p>countrymen in the invaded territores are permitted to read.
</p>
<p>"M. Marchand also discovered something else of vital im-
</p>
<p>portance. Each one of these campaigns is subdivided into a
</p>
<p>certain number of chapters. He found the same number of
</p>
<p>these subivisions in the 'Gazette des Ardennes\ as in the
</p>
<p>'Bonnet Rouge'. Furthermore,each of these subdivisions de-
</p>
<p>velops its arguments in exactly the same way, sometimes with
</p>
<p>identical phrases, sometimes word for word the same.

<p>clear that from 1916 on, from the moment that Duval be-
</p>
<p>238 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>came the administrator and money lender of the 'Bonnet
</p>
<p>Rouge 1 , it began a campaign in complete accord with the in-
</p>
<p>terests of the German Empire.
</p>
<p>"Let us call this campaign, the German campaign. Its
</p>
<p>object was to procure the moral failure of the peoples who
</p>
<p>were combatting Germany. It began towards the end of
</p>
<p>1914, after the Battle of the Yser.
</p>
<p>"Germany then realized that it was necessary to divide
</p>
<p>the Allies, to weaken their energy, to exploit all their em-
</p>
<p>otions, all their passions, their mournings, their lassitudes,
</p>
<p>their sufferings, their errors, their illusions. It was nesessary
</p>
<p>to inflame their ambitions, their rancor, their cupidity, their
</p>
<p>jealousies, their hatreds.
</p>
<p>"And Germany knew exceedingly well how to do this.
</p>
<p>"She sought first of all to lure her enemies, to lure them
</p>
<p>with the hope of a false peace, a peace without a victory.
</p>
<p>And we know today by the sad examples of Russia and
</p>
<p>Roumania, what peace without victory means, especially when
</p>
<p>dealing with Germany.
</p>
<p>"Since 1914, therefore, Germany tried to deceive the Allies
</p>
<p>with the illusion of a peace that cloaked defeat, the mirage of
</p>
<p>peace, a mirage in which one's eyes may be the more easily
</p>
<p>deceived, because of the fearful nervous strain of war, the
</p>
<p>sufferings, the misery, the agony of war.
</p>
<p>"The campaigns of the ''Bonnet Rouge" 1 have been con-
</p>
<p>ducted with a cleverness which went so far as to provide for
</p>
<p>various collaborators, various personalities, who, because of
</p>
<p>honorable records, appeared to be a guarantee of patriotism
</p>
<p>that would reassure public opinion.
</p>
<p>"In France of course, it has not been possible to make an
</p>
<p>epen German campaign, and the newspaper which posted
</p>
<p>such a sign, as, 'Maison Allemande* {German House) would
</p>
<p>have stirred the population of Paris to mob and set fire to
</p>
<p>the building.

<p>"The editors of the 'Bonnet Rouge'' were too prudent to
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 239
</p>
<p>do that. They were too resourceful. They had many dis-
</p>
<p>guises, and one was their campaign of seeking to make the
</p>
<p>French people forget the German crimes. It was a theme
</p>
<p>which fitted into the propaganda of the German Empire
</p>
<p>perfectly. It tried to influence us to be more just, if I dare
</p>
<p>use that expression, towards the Germans. Then came the
</p>
<p>campaign of suspicion. It was directed at all the Allies to
</p>
<p>embroil them. And behind these two campaigns was the one
</p>
<p>German purpose of turning France away from her friends
</p>
<p>and delivering her into the hands of the enemy.
</p>
<p>"The 'Bonnet Rouge 9 sought even to direct the suspicions
</p>
<p>of the French toward themselves, to convince them that they
</p>
<p>themselves, were responsible for the war. It endeavored to
</p>
<p>persuade them that they were fighting not for their country,
</p>
<p>but remote and unjust conquests.
</p>
<p>"Then there was the campaign for an immediate peace, a
</p>
<p>campaign which was pushed with great vigor. And when
</p>
<p>this thought had sunk deep, the'Bonnet Rouge 9 began a
</p>
<p>guarded crusade to inspire revolt and desertion.
</p>
<p>"I was speaking a moment ago, of the 'Bonnet Rouge's*
</p>
<p>offensive against hatred, as M. Marchand phrased it. I do
</p>
<p>not want to leave that phase of the case without a final
</p>
<p>thought.
</p>
<p>"When we consider that ten of our departments are still
</p>
<p>under the German heel, when we hear every day that one of
</p>
<p>our ancient cities has been destroyed, when we learn that still
</p>
<p>more atrocities have been perpetrated, I must say that I feel
</p>
<p>a hatred for the Germans, a hatred which will persist for
</p>
<p>centuries.
</p>
<p>"It is a Holy Hatred.
</p>
<p>"It is a Holy Hatred, because, when a people has done
</p>
<p>what Germany has done, that people and that government
</p>
<p>have placed themselves outside of humanity for centuries.

<p>240 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>you what Duval under the pen name of M. Badin said of
</p>
<p>people animated by hatred.
</p>
<p>"In an article of August 1, 1916, he calls them 'the De-
</p>
<p>moniacs.' M. Badin means that those who are crying venge-
</p>
<p>ance for German crimes are demoniacs.
</p>
<p>"Now, listen to something still more perfidious.
</p>
<p>"It followed the establishment of the 'Ligue du Souvenir'
</p>
<p>(League of Remembrance), created to perpetuate the memory
</p>
<p>of German crimes At its head were M. Mirman, prefect of
</p>
<p>Meurthe-et-Moselle : M. Simon, Mayor of Nancy; and M.
</p>
<p>Keller, Mayor of Luneville; all well qualified to know what
</p>
<p>German crimes are. These gentlemen explained the purpose
</p>
<p>of their organization, as follows :
</p>
<p>" 'What will happen after the war? We do not wish to
</p>
<p>try to predict We are not combatting any tendency. We
</p>
<p>only wish to dissipate ignorance. People, according to their
</p>
<p>various temperments will pardon the German beast, if they
</p>
<p>wish it and when they wish it. They will pardon him un-
</p>
<p>qualifiedly, or according to certain conditions, but first
</p>
<p>they must know the truth.'
</p>
<p>"What is the 'Bonnet Rouge's' reply to such language?
</p>
<p>Here it is, in the issue of October 18, 1916:
</p>
<p>" 'These words are signed by Messers Mirman, Simon and
</p>
<p>Keller. I cannot fail to discover in them a sort of Jesuitism,
</p>
<p>which frightens me. How can they dare affirm that they are
</p>
<p>trying to influence the future judgment of men, when they
</p>
<p>sow hatred? Is it our task to ask our soldiers that they
</p>
<p>take vengeance under the hypocritical pretext of justice?'
</p>
<p>"No remembrance, no rancor, no hatred, only love, yes,
</p>
<p>love. Such was the motto of the 'Bonnet Rouge' of April 18,
</p>
<p>1917. I quote now from an article of that date.

</p>
<p>"Yes," thundered Lt. Mornet, suddenly casting the news-
</p>
<p>paper aside, and exclaiming:
</p>
<p>"Only born for love, whom the Gothas assassinate at
</p>
<p>night."
</p>
<p>Opening the pages of the 'Bonnet Rouge' again, the pro-
</p>
<p>secutor proceeded:
</p>
<p>"And now here is something still more odious. It is a
</p>
<p>story put into the mouth of someone from the invaded
</p>
<p>territory, and reads:
</p>
<p>' 'War is not a cheerful conversation. One must not show
</p>
<p>only one face of the truth, for it has several. For instance,
</p>
<p>life at first in the invaded districts was quite painful, because
</p>
<p>the newspapers from Paris were frightening us with their
</p>
<p>stories of the cruelties of the invaders.
</p>
<p>'* 'As soon as this fright passed away and the Germans
</p>
<p>prevented the Paris papers from reaching the invaded coun-
</p>
<p>tries, different relations were established between the con-
</p>
<p>querors and the people of the invaded regions. There were
</p>
<p>some touching scenes. I might speak, for example, of the
</p>
<p>manner in which a German major took care of our sick, and
</p>
<p>with what intelligent methods the invaders organized some
</p>
<p>of our own services.'
</p>
<p>"To hear the 'Bonnet Rouge' speak, the German is gentle :
</p>
<p>he is incapable of doing any harm : he has a kind soul. When
</p>
<p>one knows him, one loves him: and he conquers us for a
</p>
<p>second time.
</p>
<p>"No, I do not exaggerate at all. Judge for yourselves. I
</p>
<p>quote now from the issue of February 22, 1917:
</p>
<p>" 'Preceded by the .reputation of being 'wild beasts', the
</p>
<p>Germans in our fields of France have conquered our peasants.
</p>
<p>These Germans are gentle, polite, laborious. 'The German
</p>
<p>prisoners have shown that they possess a kind soul. They
</p>
<p>find pleasure in things which are neither low nor coarse.
</p>

<p>"This is only praise for the German soul. Now we will
</p>
<p>242 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>listen to the clear voice of admiration. An article in Dec-
</p>
<p>ember 1915, entitled, 'A la maniere de Romain Roland' (After
</p>
<p>Jie style of Romain Roland) reads:
</p>
<p>" 'Why should I exploit the pro French sentiments of an
</p>
<p>ignorant people and yell insults at the nation, which gave
</p>
<p>birth to Kant and other masters of the new man. I envy
</p>
<p>the magnificent dash, the fiery passion of the German soul.
</p>
<p>I wish that a little of those qualities would inflame our own
</p>
<p>minds.'
</p>
<p>"Now for the other side of the picture. In contrast with
</p>
<p>this praise of Germany appears the insidious crusade, which
</p>
<p>the 'Bonnet Rouge' waged against our Allies, and especially
</p>
<p>England. Let me quote from the 'Bonnet Rouge' of June 5,
</p>
<p>1916, from an article, entitled The Pans. This sentence is
</p>
<p>enough :
</p>
<p>" 'We know 'Pan Germanism,' 'Pan Slavism' ; but now a
</p>
<p>third 'Pan' looms upon the horizon, 'Pan Britainism.'
</p>
<p>"The editors of the 'Bonnet Rouge' do not wish us to feel
</p>
<p>any hatred against Germany, but, whenever they speak of
</p>
<p>England, they seek to arouse the rancor of past ages. M.
</p>
<p>Badin is strangely tenacious in this policy. On July 14,
</p>
<p>1916, he writes:
</p>
<p>" 'The suffragettes have just organized in London a cor-
</p>
<p>tege, which has provoke the enthusiasm of the imbeciles. The
</p>
<p>thought that comes to me out of this banality is that Saint
</p>
<p>Michael and Jeanne d' Arc were placed at the head of the
</p>
<p>procession. The leader of the suffragettes has undoubtedly
</p>
<p>heard that the English nation has forgotten the rather lively
</p>
<p>quarrel which embroiled it with the Pucelle d' Orleans (The
</p>
<p>Maid of Orleans) and that we for our part must forget the
</p>
<p>acrimonious discussions, which we had at the time of Trafal-
</p>
<p>gar and Waterloo. A lesson good for reflection.'
</p>
<p>"The Bonnet Rouge has tried to persuade the French
</p>
<p>people, that they have been doing all the fighting, that for

<p>the English the war was a promenade, a play, a physical

<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 243
</p>
<p>culture exercise. I will quote 'M. BadinV own words, from
</p>
<p>the "Bonnet Rouge' of June 21, 1916:
</p>
<p>" 'I am a fervent Anglophile. When so many people con-
</p>
<p>sider the war a tragedy, even a cataclysm, I certainly admire
</p>
<p>those who prefer to regard it, as a physical culture exercise.'
</p>
<p>"The same note is to be found in what 'M. Badin' said in
</p>
<p>the 'Bonnet Rouge* of June 24, 1916. Let me quote him
</p>
<p>again :
</p>
<p>" 'Some peevish minds are excited, because the uniform of
</p>
<p>our brave poilus is more neglected than that of our Allies.
</p>
<p>This is because they are the children and not the guests of
</p>
<p>the house. Our poilus must know that where feasts are given,
</p>
<p>they must yield to our guests and discreetly efface themselves.
</p>
<p>Anyhow, have they not the battlefield where they can get their
</p>
<p>due and proudly place themselves in the lead?
</p>
<p>" 'I do not want to be suspected of even wishing to insin-
</p>
<p>uate, that all the fine looking and well groomed soldiers, who
</p>
<p>hoist the cockade of our Allies on their martial helmets for-
</p>
<p>get in the delights of a great city the rude call to arms. If
</p>
<p>they rest and amuse themselves, they will be the more spright-
</p>
<p>ly, when it is necessary to come to the rescue and take the
</p>
<p>place of our fallen heroes. In a long war, such as this one,
</p>
<p>it is of importance to provide reserves.'
</p>
<p>"What more perfidious argument?" exclaimed Lt. Mornet
</p>
<p>pointing his guant finger at Duval. "What could be more
</p>
<p>insidiously conceived to fill the minds of the French people
</p>
<p>with suspicions and hatreds toward their allies? Here is
</p>
<p>another example, intended to wound, to offend the feelings
</p>
<p>of the French to the very quick. On September 8, 1916, 'M.

<p>Badin' wrote:
</p>

<p>nade for such a situation. But how ignorant I am. They
</p>
<p>244 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>have even done more than that. They have been contracting
</p>
<p>marriages on the spot.
</p>
<p>" 'Numerous weddings have been celebrated between British
</p>
<p>soldiers and young French girls. But the rapidity of these
</p>
<p>unions has not always permitted the newly wed British to be
</p>
<p>free of all matrimonial ties in their own country. Some
</p>
<p>accidents have happened. There have been bigamies.
</p>
<p>" 'Next year, when I shall go to spend my vacation in the
</p>
<p>Alps, I shall take inspiration from the practical methods of
</p>
<p>the Allies. I shall temporarily marry a native girl, who will
</p>
<p>charm my nights of exile. For example, Mile. Chrysanthemum
</p>
<p>Savoyarde.'
</p>
<p>"Against the United States, we also find the 'Bonnet Rouge'
</p>
<p>aligned. It tried to keep that country and France apart. For
</p>
<p>nearly a year we find in the 'Bonnet Rouge' a continuous
</p>
<p>campaign against American intervention. 'Why do they
</p>
<p>want to fight?' was the daily theme of the articles of the
</p>
<p>'Bonnet Rouge' during the entire year of 1916 ; and when
</p>
<p>America finally broke with Germany, Almereyda informed his
</p>
<p>readers it was almost a catastrophy. The following day, he
</p>
<p>mastered his emotions, but with a perfidy that may be clearly
</p>
<p>seen. He said, 'Still a rupture of diplomatic relations does
</p>
<p>not necessarily mean war. Therein lies our hope.'
</p>
<p>"Everything was not yet lost for Germany, nor for the
</p>
<p>'Bonnet Rouge'. Almereyda immediately launched a series of
</p>
<p>articles in which he did not cease to demonstrate to French
</p>
<p>readers that it was to their interest that the United States
</p>
<p>should not actively participate in the war. He wrote, for
</p>
<p>example, on February 7, 1917 :
</p>
<p>" 'I attempted day before yesterday to examine the con-
</p>
<p>sequences of the last act of M. Wilson and tried to demon-
</p>
<p>strate that every medallion has a reverse side. Already a
</p>
<p>big munition manufacturing company has been advised to
</p>
<p>cease furnishing munitions abroad. I make no comment.'

</p>
<p>Despite his apparent power, despite his seeming wealth, his
</p>
<p>two villas, his two mistresses, his fleet of automobiles, and all
</p>
<p>that, Almereyda became only a tool in the hands of Duval.
</p>
<p>"Duval had the money. Marion, Landau and Goldsky look-
</p>
<p>ed to Duval and did his bidding for this reason. Vercasson
</p>
<p>brought him the checks of Marx. Leymarie saw that he got
</p>
<p>his passport and the check that had been seized. They all
</p>
<p>accommodated themselves to his will and they are all guilty."
</p>
<p>After telling of Duval's various trips to Switzerland, Lt.
</p>
<p>Mornet said: "It was upon his return from his last journey,
</p>
<p>in May, 1917, that the 150,000 franc check was seized, which
</p>
<p>led to the collapse of this house of iniquity. Duval has tried
</p>
<p>to explain this check so many ways, that he has convicted
</p>
<p>himself out of his own mouth. With his own hands and
</p>
<p>through Vercasson Duval received nearly one million francs
</p>
<p>of German gold."
</p>
<p>The prosecutor frequently quoted from the mass of doc-
</p>
<p>umentary evidence piled before him. Government agents had
</p>
<p>gathered together checks, bank books, ledgers, official reports
</p>
<p>from various departments, letters, telegrams, photographs of
</p>
<p>signatures, and all manner of other data. When he spoke of

<p>the contents of Caillaux's Italian safe and the communication

<p>found there which Caillaux received from Marx, Lt. Mornet

<p>exclaimed :

</p>
<p>The accused were all adjudged guilty. Their sentences

<p>were:

</p>
<p>The demoralized state of the French army at the time the
</p>
<p>United States went to the rescue of the Allies was set forth
</p>
<p>in bold, black outline at the trial of Malvy, before the Senate,
</p>
<p>as a High Court. The final sessions began July 16, 1918,
</p>
<p>the day before Duval was executed. Letters from French
</p>
<p>generals were read, telling of the disastrous effect of the
</p>
<p>pacifist propaganda in the trenches, the camps, the hospitals,
</p>
<p>the munition plants, the railroads, and even the homes of the
</p>
<p>soldiers.
</p>
<p>M. Merillon, President of the Chamber of Petitions of the
</p>
<p>Court of Cassation, conducted the prosecution. He pro-
</p>
<p>duced a mass of evidence which proved that Malvy, the tool
</p>
<p>of Caillaux, the patron of the 'Bonnet Rouge' gang, was
</p>
<p>chiefly responsible for this deplorable situation. He showed
</p>
<p>that Malvy almost succeeded in betraying France to the
</p>
<p>enemy.
</p>
<p>That Americans may still better understand how far the
</p>
<p>venom of the pacifist movement under Malvy had poisoned
</p>
<p>public opinion, let me quote from a high officer of the United
</p>

</p>
<p>while lying in the harbor of Brest, on December 10, 1918.
</p>
<p>The party consisted of correspondents on their way to the
</p>
<p>peace conference. He said :
</p>
<p>"Brest has become intensely socialistic. As a result of
</p>
<p>the pacifist movement, a great number of people around
</p>
<p>here have wanted to end the war at any cost. Indeed, the
</p>
<p>feeling was so strong, that when the American troops began
</p>
<p>to arrive at Brest, some of the pacifists threw stones, crying :
</p>
<p>" 'Go back to the United States.' 'You will only make the
</p>
<p>war last longer.' 'We want peace, not soldiers.' "
</p>
<p>It was not until the French began to realize that such a
</p>
<p>sentiment was only the insidious and iniquitous outgrowth of
</p>
<p>German propaganda, not until the French government
</p>
<p>through the fearless efforts of Clemenceau and his associates
</p>
<p>sought to purge their country of pacifism and defeatism, did
</p>
<p>France again rise in all the glory of her military traditions
</p>
<p>and drive the Teuton invaders back to the Rhine.
</p>
<p>There had been two charges against Malvy:
</p>
<p>(1) That he informed the enemy of various military and
</p>
<p>diplomatic projects, particularly the plan of attack at Che-
</p>
<p>min-des-Dames :
</p>
<p>(2) That he assisted the enemy by provoking or inciting
</p>
<p>military mutinies.
</p>
<p>These accusations had grown out of the letter of Daudet
</p>
<p>to President Poincare, branding Malvy a traitor; but as the
</p>
<p>result of a long investigation the Senate decided that there
</p>
<p>was no proof that the former Cabinet member was personally
</p>
<p>involved in these treason plots. Daudet's charges, according-
</p>
<p>ly, were abandoned. Instead, Malvy was tried for having
</p>
<p>"ignored, violated and betrayed his duty", as a minister.
</p>
<p>Very pale, very nervous, Malvy sat beside the bulky, stolid
</p>
<p>Bourdillon, his chief of counsel. With Caillaux behind prison
</p>
<p>bars, Malvy had become a changed man The dynamo, that

<p>250 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>and listened to the multitude of witnesses, the vast array of
</p>
<p>documents, which showed he had permtted France to waver
</p>
<p>on the verge of revolution and destruction, he seemed almost
</p>
<p>to wither away. Now and then, as when interpellated by M.
</p>
<p>Merillon, he would present an appearance of courage, but his
</p>
<p>paleness betrayed his fear. Despite all his show of bravery,
</p>
<p>he could not conceal the coward within.
</p>
<p>The prosecutor told of the ravages of pacificism, defeatism,
</p>
<p>and anarchy because Malvy made no effort to stop them. He
</p>
<p>explained how all these agencies were aiding the enemy. He
</p>
<p>said that Malvy had continued for three years, as Minister of
</p>
<p>the Interior in the successive cabinets of Viviani, Briand and
</p>
<p>Ribot, and that even Painleve, who followed Ribot, tried to
</p>
<p>whitewash him. In revealing the cause of Malvy's continued
</p>
<p>power, M. Merillon declared:
</p>
<p>"When Premiers chose their ministers, they do not pick
</p>
<p>them helter skelter. No. They chose men with the intention
</p>
<p>of establishing successful administrations. They made excell-
</p>
<p>ent selections in some cases, but they have always sought
</p>
<p>representatives of the various parties. M. Malvy represent-
</p>
<p>ed the Radical Socialist element.
</p>
<p>"This Radical Socialist party may be today, I do not say,
</p>
<p>separated, but rather distant from its former chief. But
</p>
<p>who can deny that in this party there was a man with great
</p>
<p>authority, an iron will, an absolutely boundless ambition, who
</p>
<p>lead his followers with supreme authority? I speak of M.
</p>
<p>Caillaux.
</p>
<p>"In the Ministry of the Interior, M. Malvy was always
</p>
<p>the representative of his chief, the representative of M. Cail-
</p>
<p>laux.
</p>
<p>The rapidly increasing demoralization of the French army,

<p>before and even for some time after the United States entered

</p>
<p>"There was a vast military plot, upon which must be turned
</p>
<p>the search light of justice. Proof of the far reaching charac-

<p>ter of this conspiracy is abundant. Many instances of mut-

</p>
<p>report of June 5, 1917. (two months after the United States
</p>
<p>declared war against Germany) and in which he said:
</p>
<p>" 'On June 2, at noon, the. . . .R. I. (a regiment of infant-

<p>ry, whose number was suppressed) received an order pre-
</p>
<p>paratory to leaving the cantonment at Coeuvres during the

<p>following night, to go to Bucy-le-Long.
</p>
<p>" 'I at once communicated this order to the battalions, and
</p>
<p>it could easily be seen that it would be executed with diffi-

<p>culty. To tell the truth, the scandalous spectacle displayed
</p>
<p>by other units on preceeding days had caused a noticeable

<p>uneasiness among the troops.

<p>ments in auto trucks, with the men waving red banners, sing-

<p>noticed the following day among the men of Regiment. .

<p>transported likewise in auto trucks.

<p>" 'However, during the morning of June 2, the attitude of

</p>
<p>After these quotations from General Petain, ,the Peres re-

</p>
<p>"These are only a few examples which may help us to ap-
</p>
<p>preciate the gravity of the situation. The causes are to be
</p>
<p>found in other army documents, as for instance the reports
</p>
<p>of Lt. Col. Dussange and other reports of General Petain.
</p>
<p>A report from the latter says :
</p>
<p>" 'These manifestations do not seem to be directed against
</p>
<p>army commanders but against the government. Our men
</p>
<p>say to us, "We have nothing against you, our grievance is

<p>against the government. Our wives are starving. They are

</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 255
</p>
<p>" '(8) Popular movements which are now taking place in
</p>
<p>Paris.
</p>
<p>" 'These movements have deep roots in the interior of
</p>
<p>France. Accordingly, as a result of the furlough system,
</p>
<p>which cannot be changed, the front is bound to the rest of
</p>
<p>France. (Soldiers are constantly going and coming, con-
</p>
<p>stantly bringing back all they hear in the interior). There-
</p>
<p>fore the whole situation may at any time become very grave,
</p>
<p>and I cannot insist too strongly upon adopting vigorous
</p>
<p>measures for remedying these conditions. The most necessary
</p>
<p>things to do are the following:
</p>
<p>" '(1) To stop the circulation of pamphlets in the vicinity
</p>
<p>of the railroad stations in Paris. Those who distribute these
</p>
<p>pamphlets are well known.
</p>
<p>" '(2) To take steps against mobilized officers, soldiers
</p>
<p>and workingmen, who frequent pacifist gatherings in the
</p>
<p>hinterland, and at once to send them back to the front.
</p>
<p>" '(3) To direct and to watch the press closely.
</p>
<p>"'(4) To repress immediately what is found harmful.'
</p>
<p>"The depression prevailing in the army after the failure of
</p>
<p>the Champagne offensive was the result of the pacifist move-
</p>
<p>ment, the red flag, the ' International', the organization of a
</p>
<p>system of insubordination.
</p>
<p>"The mental attitude of the troops has been affected by a
</p>
<p>prolonged, continuous campaign. This may be seen by such
</p>
<p>statements among the soldiers, as these:
</p>
<p>" 'The failure of the offensive means the end of command.
</p>
<p>Victory is impossible. Russia is running toward a separate
</p>
<p>peace. Why do we not stop the struggle? Formerly one
</p>
<p>hundred years behind us, Russia is now a century ahead. The
</p>
<p>government is concealing the truth. Continuation of the
</p>
<p>war means famine. No more coal. No more bread. Foreign-
</p>
<p>ers are replacing the combattants. Time is consolidating the

<p>invasion.'

<p>256 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>reecho the subjects of pacifist meetings, the themes of paci-
</p>
<p>fist newspapers and pamphlets. Such thoughts have pro-
</p>
<p>duced gradually in the brains of men a state of morbid
</p>
<p>sensitiveness, of emotional receptivity, of weak mental re-
</p>
<p>sistance, which will surge into a tremendous force in a mom-
</p>
<p>ent of crisis.
</p>
<p>"Other reasons for the depressed spirit of the troops are:
</p>
<p>"(1) The exaltation of the Russian revolution and its
</p>
<p>methods by such newspapers as the 'Bonnet Rouge', the
</p>
<p>'Journal of the People', the 'Popular Voice of the Center',
</p>
<p>the 'Republican Trench', and the 'Motherland', thanks to the
</p>
<p>failures of the censorship or in spite of its injunctions.
</p>
<p>"(2) The regular, if not official meetings of the pacifists,
</p>
<p>under cover of so called corporative reunions.
</p>
<p>"(3) The encouragement of insubordination and desertion
</p>
<p>by such men, as Sebastien Faure, who have been openly aiding
</p>
<p>culprits seeking shelter in Paris.
</p>
<p>"(4) The Stockholm conference.
</p>
<p>"(5) The calumnious story of the killing of women by the
</p>
<p>Annamites and the police, a story which grew out of an in-
</p>
<p>significant scuffle, but which was so greatly magnified, that
</p>
<p>on May 17, 1917, the Committee of Understanding of the
</p>
<p>Syndicalist Young Men issued a proclamation, that the police,
</p>
<p>not satisfied with massacring Chinese workmen at Firminy,
</p>
<p>were beating the seamstress strikers in Paris. On June 1,
</p>
<p>the 'Les Amis De Ce Qu 'II Faut Dire', (The Friends of What
</p>
<p>Must Be Told) a revolutionary newspaper, even went further
</p>
<p>and said :
</p>
<p>" 'Those at the front will not permit with impunity the
</p>
<p>heads of the government to massacre their wives and their
</p>
<p>children, after causing them by their carelessness to suffer
</p>
<p>from cold and hunger.'

</p>

</p>
<p>"On June 4, Pericat declared before 1000 strikers of the
</p>
<p>Citroen establishment (one of the largest munition plants in
</p>
<p>France), 'The Annamites, the guardians of peace, the mun-
</p>
<p>icipal guards, are ready to massacre you with their machine
</p>
<p>guns.'
</p>
<p>"Thus we may see how the various defeatist agents are
</p>
<p>using silly rumors to frighten and demoralize the people.
</p>
<p>"(6) The belief of a revolution, which was to break out in
</p>
<p>May and be followed by a revolt on the front. In April at
</p>
<p>Roanne a cortege of 6000 strikers marched through the
</p>
<p>streets, shouting, 'Down with the war'. They tore down the
</p>
<p>flag of the sub prefecture.
</p>
<p>"The Prefect of the Loire has called the attention of the
</p>
<p>authorities to the dangerous work of revolutionary and paci-
</p>
<p>fist agents in the basin of St. Etienne. Letters which are
</p>
<p>spreading the ill winds of revolt are coming from such agit-
</p>
<p>ated regions as (St. Etienne, Lyons, Levallois-Perret, the
</p>
<p>XI, XVIII, and XX arrondissements of Paris, Rouen, and
</p>
<p>Moulins). And these letters reflect the talk in the trenches,
</p>
<p>brought back by the soldiers who have been on furlough.
</p>
<p>"Some soldiers have even mingled with the paraders. Others
</p>
<p>still bolder, took the stump to 'bring to the strikers the
</p>
<p>support of the poilus', as may have been seen at the meetings
</p>
<p>of the women garment and feather workers on May 27, 1917.
</p>
<p>They spread the cry :

<p>" 'Enough people have been killed.' 'Give us peace*. 'The
</p>
<p>women want peace and their rights'.

</p>
<p>"Indeed, we should seek the agents of revolution among the
</p>
<p>soldiers themselves. An army report of June 6, 1917, con-
</p>
<p>cludes :
</p>
<p>" 'The instigators of this movement are said to be the men
</p>
<p>of the 1917 class, recently arrived at the front, having come
</p>
<p>from the interior. Others had been on leave to recuperate.
</p>
<p>Many are reported to belong to such industrial centers as
</p>
<p>St. Etienne and Firminy. Small circulars are being distri-
</p>
<p>buted by civilians as well as soldiers on the trains among
</p>
<p>troops returning to the front from furlough. They are
</p>
<p>entitled :
</p>
<p>" 'Peace without conquests, without annexations, without
</p>
<p>indemnities.'
</p>
<p>" 'Your mouths !' 'Stockholm'. One reads :
</p>
<p>" 'Come on, comrades. Let us be serious and couragous for
</p>
<p>once. The civilians are depending on the soldiers, and the
</p>
<p>soldiers count on the civilians for action in favor of peace.
</p>
<p>Come on slumberers, come on, parlor critics. This is not the
</p>
<p>hour for talking, but acting. We must have peace. Our
</p>
<p>comrades of the provisional government of Russia are invit-
</p>
<p>ing us to speak of peace at Stockholm. We must go there.
</p>
<p>(Signed,) The Pacifist Committee of the French Working-
</p>
<p>men and Soldiers.'
</p>
<p>"Several unfortunates, who had taken the initative in one
</p>
<p>rebellion confessed while being led away to the place of ex-
</p>
<p>ecution. One belonging to the Tenth Army admitted that he
</p>
<p>was obeying the commands of a central organization of the
</p>
<p>interior, whose agents were duty bound to spread its in-
</p>
<p>structions among the troops. Another said :
</p>
<p>" 'The movement has been organized by a few with whom
</p>
<p>we are in constant correspondence. The order for a re-
</p>
<p>volution was given for a fixed date in certain regiments as

<p>well as the 18th R. I. At the same time three other regiments
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 259
</p>
<p>were to refuse to march. We were easily led. Things were
</p>
<p>not ready.'
</p>
<p>"In view of these facts was it not possible to learn who were
</p>
<p>the directors of this rebellion and to seize them? Yet, no-
</p>
<p>thing was done. No organizers have been caught. No effort
</p>
<p>was made to catch the central body. The only activity thus
</p>
<p>far has been limited to a few individual, isolated cases.
</p>
<p>"In the light of these facts the statement of Ventillard, of
</p>
<p>the 'Committee of Defense' and the 'Syndicalist Young Men',
</p>
<p>is significant. On June 8, to the 'Committee of Understand-
</p>
<p>ing for the Resumption of International Relations,' he said:
</p>
<p>" 'In this movement there has been neither order nor man-
</p>
<p>agement, but a tenaciousness, which is constantly revealing
</p>
<p>itself. The nation has demonstrated that it wanted to escape
</p>
<p>from bondage. The French nation has been a nation of
</p>
<p>sheep. But this time we shall come down the street with
</p>
<p>revolvers and handgrenades. Then you will see that regi-
</p>
<p>ments will mutiny one after another. We shall place our-
</p>
<p>selves at the head of the movement.' '
</p>
<p>In declaring that Malvy was chiefly responsible for this
</p>
<p>perilous situation, Prosecutor Merillon said :
</p>
<p>"The complicity charge against M. Malvy is not the com-
</p>
<p>plicity of a bandit, who would be on the watch; but of an-
</p>
<p>other nature equally as grave. It is the complicity of a man
</p>
<p>who has a duty and who does not perform it, who instead of
</p>
<p>using the machinery of his ministry, of the police, the secret
</p>
<p>service, the passport bureau, to detect, arrest, and bring to
</p>
<p>justice the enemies within, did nothing. Worst than that,
</p>
<p>he has even encouraged some of these malefactors with sub-
</p>
<p>sidies.
</p>
<p>"M. Malvy must be held absolutely responsible for the
</p>
<p>acts of his subordinates. He himself assumed this respon-
</p>
<p>sibility. Those who were working under his orders, the Pre-

<p>stood that they could not act under certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>260 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>They knew they were bound by a rule, which I may translate
</p>
<p>as follows :
</p>
<p>" 'Nothing must be done, no matter what the crime, if com-
</p>
<p>mitted under the high protection of certain personages, as
</p>
<p>for example, the workingmen's syndicates or the General Fed-
</p>
<p>eration of Labor.'
</p>
<p>"In such crimes, we discover that certain instructions were
</p>
<p>always given, and that these instructions whether eminating
</p>
<p>from the Prefect of Police or Surete Generale, were the orders
</p>
<p>of M. Malvy."
</p>
<p>M. Merillon read from the police records the lists of agit-
</p>
<p>ators, anarchists and all round criminals, which Almereyda
</p>
<p>had made Malvy liberate. He proved that the Apache aditor
</p>
<p>of the 'Bonnet Rouge* was a constant, welcome visitor at
</p>
<p>the Ministry. He read his letters to Malvy and Malvy's
</p>
<p>assistants, asking for favors which were never refused. He
</p>
<p>exhibited hundreds of complaints against pacifists and defeat-
</p>
<p>ists, who were holding meetings, distributing literature, mak-
</p>
<p>ing stump speeches, but all to no effect. He showed how the
</p>
<p>Second Bureau, consisting of army police, tried to detect and
</p>
<p>arrest these criminals, and how,after constant clashes with
</p>
<p>the police of the Ministry of the Interior, Malvy had the
</p>
<p>Second Bureau suppressed.
</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples of the way Malvy's min-
</p>
<p>istry killed any investigation that would interfere with the
</p>
<p>pacifists, said M. Merillon, was the Mauricius affair.
</p>
<p>"Mauricius," he continued, "belonged to the Sebastien
</p>
<p>Faure group. He lectured for the purpose of preventing
</p>
<p>laboring men from working for the national defense. M.

<p>Blanc, a special commissary, reported to Second Lt. Bruy-
</p>
<p>and, that the production of the workshops of Bourges was
</p>
<p>less than 50 per cent, of normal because of anti war propag-
</p>
<p>anda. M. Blanc said the propagandists were working openly

<p>" 'I have the honor to inform you that the anarchistic

<p>Bourges by 70 workmen had decided to hold a meeting on

<p>April 1. The subject for discussion will be:

<p>"'"The International, the Causes of the War." The

<p>What was the verdict?
</p>
<p>262 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>Did these Senators after learning the monstrous perfidy
</p>
<p>of this high government official, of the man who almost de-
</p>
<p>livered their country to the enemy, vote immediately and
</p>
<p>unanimously the extreme penalty?
</p>
<p>No.
</p>
<p>They decided the law would not permit drastic punishment.
</p>
<p>After much discussion they concluded that the maximum
</p>
<p>penalty for Malvy was a five year exile and a paltry fine of
</p>
<p>$300. They did not even take away his civil rights. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, when his five years of vacation are ended, he may come
</p>
<p>back to his old haunts and enjoy all his old time privileges.
</p>
<p>On August 11, 1918, Malvy left Paris for a villa at San
</p>
<p>Sebastian, Spain. A deputation from the semi revolutionary
</p>
<p>General Labor Federation escorted him to the train and
</p>
<p>cheered, as he was about to step aboard. When asked by a
</p>
<p>reporter how he intended to spend his exile he answered:
</p>
<p>"Wait."
</p>
<p>Aboard the train was a bearded poilu, who sprang from
</p>
<p>his seat, when he heard the cheering, and thrust his head
</p>
<p>through the window.
</p>
<p>"Who is the man for whom they are yelling?" asked the
</p>
<p>soldier. At that moment the socialists swung their caps over
</p>
<p>their heads and cried lustily :
</p>
<p>" Vive Malvy!" "Vive Caillaux!"
</p>
<p>"What! Is that Malvy?" exclaimed the poilu. "Is that
</p>
<p>the man who betrayed France?" And rushing out on the
</p>
<p>platform, brandishing his trench helmet, as if to strike down
</p>
<p>the whole party, he shouted:
</p>
<p>"Vive la France!"
</p>
<p>The socialists slunk away, and with a quick, nervous step

</p>
<p>France
</p>
<p>It was the night of June 28, 1919. A few hours before
</p>
<p>in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles the delegates of the Allies
</p>
<p>and Germany had signed the treaty, which officially ended the
</p>
<p>great world war. After nearly five years of the most mom-
</p>
<p>entous, most stupendous conflict in the history of man, peace
</p>
<p>at last seemed to have come again.
</p>
<p>At a table on the sidewalk in front of a glittering cafe
</p>
<p>near the Opera on the Boulevard des Italiens there sat an
</p>
<p>American, a Frenchman and a Britisher. All were Colonels.
</p>
<p>The American and Englishman were on "Paris leave". The
</p>
<p>Frenchman was attached to a military department with offices
</p>
<p>not far from the Seine. They had stopped only for a moment
</p>
<p>to watch the gay crowds stream by. Not since Paris went

<p>mad on "Armistice Night" had the populace seemed so happy,

<p>so on tiptoe for a frolic, as now.

<p>and who still remained, and, gayest of all, the Paris shop
</p>
<p>girls, who can dress at night with an elegance peculiarly their
</p>
<p>own ; all these types and many more swept by. Further away
</p>
<p>from the Opera, where the Boulevard des Italiens bends into
</p>
<p>the Boulevard Montmartre and continues on, as the Boulevard
</p>
<p>Poissonniere, the Boulevard de Bonne Nouville and the Boule-
</p>
<p>vard St. Martin, merry crowds were dancing in the street to
</p>
<p>the lively strains of the violin or accordion. They danced
</p>
<p>their native dances in so quick a measure, that the few Ameri-
</p>
<p>can soldiers who tried a step or two became completely be-
</p>
<p>wildered. Now and then through the multitude, a huge
</p>
<p>German cannon, one of the thousands that line the Avenue
</p>
<p>des Champs-Elysees to bear witness of the old brutish power
</p>
<p>of Germany over which France had triumphed, came rumbling
</p>
<p>along, drawn by a troop of merry makers and carrying upon
</p>
<p>its ugly back a bevy of singing girls.
</p>
<p>The three men talked of what peace meant to France, and
</p>
<p>then the American asked :
</p>
<p>"How can France have real peace as long as the socialists
</p>
<p>remain so powerful? Because of their influence Malvy prac-
</p>
<p>tically escaped and Caillaux still remains in prison untried.
</p>
<p>By the way, how long has he been awaiting trial? About a
</p>
<p>year and a half, I think. Is that not true?"
</p>
<p>"Caillaux was arrested on January 14, of last year," re-
</p>
<p>plied the Frenchman. I remember the day perfectly, be-
</p>
<p>cause I saw him in La Sante."
</p>
<p>"These socialists in France are still working in the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of Germany," continued the American. "Take Jean
</p>
<p>Longuet, Deputy of the Seine, for example. In his Populaire
</p>
<p>he has been doing all he can to smash the treaty. He leads
</p>
<p>in the cry, 'Do not take vengeance on Germany.' He would
</p>
<p>prevent France from obtaining from Germany any substant-
</p>
<p>ial reparation for all the destruction and devastation, which
</p>
<p>she has suffered at the hands of the Huns. But tell me, why

<p>does not the government try Caillaux? Is it afraid?"
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 265
</p>
<p>"Caillaux still has many friends," replied the Frenchman.
</p>
<p>"He boasts that he will go free. He says no one will dare
</p>
<p>bring him to trial, for then, like Samson, he will pull down
</p>
<p>the house in ruins on the heads of his accusers."
</p>
<p>"Or to use another metaphor," interrupted the English-
</p>
<p>man. "If they try to smash his glass house, he will smash
</p>
<p>theirs?"
</p>
<p>"Exactly, and for that reason, the best place for Caillaux
</p>
<p>during these perilous days is behind the walls of La Sante".
</p>
<p>However, we will have our national elections next fall, and
</p>
<p>then, I believe, a great many of the socialists who have
</p>
<p>played into the hands of the enemy and who are still doing
</p>
<p>everything possible to embarrass Clemenceau and disrupt the
</p>
<p>Peace Conference will be thrown out of office. The French
</p>
<p>people, as a people, are intensely patriotic. They put social-
</p>
<p>ism into power before the war, when they did not believe the
</p>
<p>warning that the socialistic cry against stronger armaments
</p>
<p>and greater military preparedness was German propaganda
</p>
<p>of the most vicious and insidious sort."
</p>
<p>"In the meantime will all the other internal enemies of
</p>
<p>France escape?" asked the American. "What has happened
</p>
<p>to Humbert, Lenoir and Desouches of Le Journal?"
</p>
<p>"Humbert was acquitted. Lenoir was condemned to death.
</p>
<p>Desouches was sentenced to five years in jail," replied the
</p>
<p>French officer. "The decisions were handed down May 8."
</p>
<p>"Humbert declared innocent!" exclaimed the American.
</p>
<p>"How could that be? Was he not mixed up with both Bolo
</p>
<p>and Lenoir? Bolo was executed and now Lenoir is proved
</p>
<p>as bad as Bolo. What is the answer?"
</p>
<p>"The court held that Senator Humbert did not know that
</p>
<p>the money ,which Bolo and Lenoir obtained from Le Journal,
</p>
<p>was German money. I have quite a number of papers in my

</p>
<p>a good many other things, of which most people in England
</p>
<p>and America are uninformed and which they should know.
</p>
<p>They will show that Germany is still fighting for supremacy,
</p>
<p>that in other and still more insidious way she is scheming to
</p>
<p>disrupt the Allies, to stir up within them social and labor
</p>
<p>hatreds, to incite class jealousies, to keep all the rest of the
</p>
<p>world in a ferment while German merchants and manufac-
</p>
<p>turers put their house in order and build up a new and a
</p>
<p>greater commercial and industrial empire."
</p>
<p>A sad faced girl in Alsatian costume had worked her way
</p>
<p>through the crowds to the table, where the three men sat,
</p>
<p>and held out a picture of Clemenceau encircled with a wreath
</p>
<p>of flowers. Below was inscribed:
</p>
<p>"The Man Who Saved France."
</p>
<p>The French Colonel sprang to his feet, and bowing gal-
</p>
<p>lantly, he said :
</p>
<p>"Yes, I want your picture. Whenever I can do honor to
</p>
<p>this greatest of Frenchman I want to do so. But why so
</p>
<p>sad, madamoiselle? Every one should be happy tonight."
</p>
<p>"I try to be," she stammered, "but I cannot forget. The
</p>
<p>war took my father and four brothers, and The
</p>
<p>tears glistened in her eyes, but she conquered them. In a
</p>
<p>quieter voice, she said: "Mother died yesterday, and so to-
</p>
<p>night sister and I are selling 'Clemenceaus. 5 '
</p>
<p>The three officers bought all the "Clemenceaus" in the little
</p>
<p>girl's basket, paying many times their original price; and,
</p>
<p>as she was still repeating, "Merci beaucoup, Messieurs, merci
</p>
<p>beaucoup, Messieurs," they turned from the cafe into the
</p>
<p>throngs of the street and strolled along past the Opera into
</p>
<p>the Boulevard des Capucines. Soon the French Colonel led
</p>
<p>them into a side street, and a moment later ushered them into
</p>
<p>a big, airy room, whose windows looked out upon a balcony
</p>
<p>edged with flowers and vines. W r hen his guests were seated

<p>on either side of a long, green-topped table, he unlocked his

</p>
<p>"You were asking me about Humbert and the Journal," he
</p>
<p>began, as he sorted out a number of papers. "To under-
</p>
<p>stand Humbert's side of it, you should read his 'apologie', as
</p>
<p>he called it, printed in Le Journal, October 4, 1918. Here, I
</p>
<p>will read an extract. Humbert said :
</p>
<p>" 'My lifework was in danger It was the most decisive and
</p>
<p>critical moment in my career. It was in July 1915, when our
</p>
<p>field artillery was visibly dwindling owing to bursting guns,
</p>
<p>and when the Senatorial Commission had to wring from the
</p>
<p>Government the measures which were our salvation.'
</p>
<p>"Well," continued the French Colonel. "Humbert explain-
</p>
<p>ed that he went to Henri Letellier, propietor of Le Journal,
</p>
<p>and got the latter's promise that if Le Journal were sold,
</p>
<p>Humbert would be one of the purchasers. Pierre Lenoir and
</p>
<p>Guillaume Desouches, the other buyers, did not want Hum-
</p>
<p>bert in. They said their money came from Lenoir's father,
</p>
<p>an advertising contractor. Humbert investigated, and when
</p>
<p>he found that Lenoir had received a 1,000,000 franc com-
</p>
<p>mission for the deal he became especially suspicious. Ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, he simply forced himself in to save Le Journal
</p>
<p>from going to strange and perhaps evil hands. He finally
</p>
<p>compelled Lenoir and Desouches to sell him 1,100 of their
</p>
<p>2,000 shares.
</p>
<p>"To pay for these shares Humbert had to get money, and
</p>
<p>when Bolo came along with the necessary cash, he took it.
</p>
<p>Later, when he learned that Bolo's money was also German,
</p>
<p>he paid Bolo back."
</p>
<p>"That is Humbert's story?" questioned the Britisher.
</p>
<p>"Yes,"
</p>
<p>"And how did Lenoir get his money from Germany ?" asked
</p>
<p>the American.
</p>
<p>"Arthur Schoeller, a director of the Schaffhausen and
</p>
<p>Derendingen spinning mills, in Zurich, Switzerland, gave
</p>
<p>Lenoir 10,000,000 francs to buy Le Journal. Schoeller ad-

<p>mitted this before his fellow directors, Koch and Hoffmann.

</p>
<p>Schoeller said Germany wanted to get Le Journal to uphold
</p>
<p>German economic interests after the war.
</p>
<p>"With Lenoir in his travels to Switzerland was a Mme.
</p>
<p>d'Arlix, who knew considerable about these treasonable trans-
</p>
<p>actions, and who became very ill. Lt. Mornet, at Lenoir's
</p>
<p>trial, openly accused Lenoir and his mother of being more
</p>
<p>than delighted to learn that Mme. d'Arlix was about to die
</p>
<p>and therefore, could not tell her story. Let me give you
</p>
<p>Lt. Mornet's very words :
</p>
<p>" 'The correspondence of Mme. Lenoir and her son paints
</p>
<p>the picture still blacker. It shows they were overjoyed to
</p>
<p>know of the approaching death of this wretched woman.'
</p>
<p>"In this same correspondence there was also mention of a
</p>
<p>mysterious character, designated as the 'Red Man'. He was
</p>
<p>a Swiss, named Hurlimann, who carried money into France
</p>
<p>for Lenoir. There was also plenty of proof that Lenoir had
</p>
<p>close relations with Erb, a pro German Swiss and a friend of
</p>
<p>Erzberger and Behrenbach, a German peace propagandist.
</p>
<p>"The trial one day produced three famous women of the
</p>
<p>demi-monde, Mme. Thouvenin, once a mistress of Lenoir;
</p>
<p>Mme. Beauregard, a mistress of Prince Hohenlohe, and Mme.
</p>
<p>Max Raymond, another of the same type. Mme. Thouvenin
</p>
<p>said that Lenoir once told her he had a big business affair at
</p>
<p>Berne. Mme. Beauregard testified that Desouches asked to
</p>
<p>be presented to Prince Hohenlohe, and showed her a letter
</p>
<p>proposing the formation of an anti British newspaper. Mme.
</p>
<p>Raymond, who met Lenoir through Desouches, said that
</p>
<p>Desouches talked of acquiring the Temps, Figaro and other
</p>
<p>Paris newspapers sometime in 1916."
</p>
<p>"Why did Desouches get only five years, if he was mixed
</p>
<p>up with such a crowd of blighters?" asked the Englishman.
</p>
<p>"Desouches is over 60 years old, and during the war he

<p>served at the front," said the Frenchman. "They let him

</p>
<p>Here the French Colonel pulled another package of papers
</p>
<p>out of his portfolio and untied a bright red cord.
</p>
<p>"The roots of German corruption reach so deep beneath
</p>
<p>the soil of France, that even now we are continually digging
</p>
<p>them up," he remarked, as he opened one yellow envelope.
</p>
<p>"Within the last few weeks, for example, evidence has been
</p>
<p>unearthed which shows that Berlin was negotiating for the
</p>
<p>purchase of the Paris newspaper, I'Eclair, long before the
</p>
<p>activities of Bolo or Duval.
</p>
<p>"A letter was found, dated in December, 1914, the fifth
</p>
<p>month of the war, which purports to be a copy of a com-
</p>
<p>munication from Gottlieb von Jagow, then German Minister
</p>
<p>of Foreign Affairs, to Baron von der Lancken, at that time
</p>
<p>Civil Governor of Brussels. The letter said that Germany
</p>
<p>could employ Ernest Judet, editor of VEclair, for 2,000,000
</p>
<p>francs ; but that von Jagow thought the sum too great and
</p>
<p>asked von der Lancken for advice. Following the arrest of
</p>
<p>Bolo and Lenoir in 1917 Judet sold P Eclair and went to
</p>
<p>Switzerland. Since then he has continued to live beyond the
</p>
<p>Alpine frontier.
</p>
<p>"Accordingly, if we were not able to uncover this VEclair
</p>
<p>affair for five long years, we must still have many more plot-
</p>
<p>ters and traitors in our midst still undetected, still working
</p>
<p>evil."
</p>
<p>"What you said about the new German offensive to con-
</p>
<p>found the Allies by inciting internal insurrections interested
</p>
<p>me tremendously," said the Englishman drawing his chair
</p>
<p>closer. "In Ireland, in India, in Egypt, in all the other
</p>
<p>parts of the British Empire, where it is possible to arouse
</p>
<p>old racial antagonisms and hatreds, the Germans are now
</p>
<p>engaged in the most insidious propaganda."

<p>at England. To prove my assertion, let me quote from a
</p>
<p>270 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>letter, which Count von Bernstorff, while still German Am-
</p>
<p>bassador to the United States, addressed to the Imperial
</p>
<p>Chancellor, Herr von Bethmann Hollweg. It was dated Rye,
</p>
<p>N. H., U. S. A., August 26, 1916, and reads :
</p>
<p>" 'I have already notified Your Excellency that the War
</p>
<p>Intelligence Centre, New York, has, by the direction of the
</p>
<p>Deputy General Staff, been immediately dissolved. There-
</p>
<p>upon doubts arose as to whether the Bureau of the Military
</p>
<p>Attache should continue to be carried on by Herr von Igle
</p>
<p>and Herr von Skal, as arranged by Herr von Papen on his
</p>
<p>departure.'
</p>
<p>"I might add here," said the French officer, "that von
</p>
<p>Papen had been caught in various plots to blow up munition
</p>
<p>factories and issue forged passports, and the United States
</p>
<p>had demanded his recall. Herr von Skal was formerly city
</p>
<p>editor of the Staats Zeitung, the leading German newspaper
</p>
<p>of New York City. Herr von Igel was mixed up in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to blow up the Welland Canal.
</p>
<p>" 'As you are aware,' wrote von Bernstorff,* the lawsuit is
</p>
<p>still pending against Herr von Igle on account of his parti-
</p>
<p>cipation in the expedition against the Welland Canal.
</p>
<p>" 'Herr von Igel and Herr von Skal, apart from the service
</p>
<p>of the War Intelligence Centre, have carried on the various
</p>
<p>commercial schemes introduced and already partly concluded
</p>
<p>by Herr von Papen. These have to do, among other things,
</p>
<p>with the orders placed by the Bridgeport Projectile Com-
</p>
<p>pany, the Aetna Powder Company, the purchase of chlorine
</p>
<p>and earthenware, and the sales of arms, stored to our account
</p>
<p>in New York and the State of Washington, for use in India.

<p>" 'The connection, moreover, in New York with the India-

</p>
<p>"May I ask how this most interesting letter came into your
</p>
<p>hands?' asked the American eagerly. "What a small world
</p>
<p>this is! I have the affidavit of a man, who saw von Skal at
</p>
<p>von Papen's offices, No. 60 Wall st., New York, before the
</p>
<p>United States entered the war The interview was to learn
</p>
<p>what action Germany would take to combat British control
</p>
<p>of the export of rubber and other war essentials, which the
</p>
<p>Germans wanted to get by way of Holland and Scandinavia.
</p>
<p>The subject turned to the British secret service, and von
</p>
<p>Skal said:
</p>
<p>" 'You should see John Devoy, editor of the Gaelic Ameri-
</p>
<p>can, No. 165 William st. Devoy knows more about British
</p>
<p>spies than anyone I can think of. Tell him that I sent you.'
</p>
<p>"My informant saw Devoy, and said he came from von
</p>
<p>Papen's office. Devoy replied that he had a great deal of
</p>
<p>material about British secret agents, and he would try to
</p>
<p>put it together. The visitor called at a later date, but never
</p>
<p>obtained any definite information. Devoy produced only news-
</p>
<p>paper clippings. Accordingly, the letter from von Bern-
</p>
<p>storff, which you just read, interests me tremendously. Can
</p>
<p>you tell me how you got it?"
</p>
<p>"Certainly," replied the Frenchman. "A copy was found
</p>
<p>among the papers of Captain von Papen, captured at Naz-
</p>
<p>areth. After von Papen was forced to give up the post of
</p>
<p>Military Attache under von Bernstorff, he returned to Ger-
</p>
<p>many and was assigned to the Near East. I guess our
</p>
<p>English friend, here, knows all about this letter and many
</p>
<p>more which were taken from the Germans in Palestine."
</p>
<p>"In the United States," said the Britisher nodding, "a num-
</p>
<p>ber of societies have been formed to free India and Egypt as
</p>
<p>well as Ireland from the 'English yoke,' as they put it. I am
</p>
<p>sure it would be exceedingly interesting, if some of those
</p>
<p>agitators were forced to explain how they are being financed."

<p>here an article from the Hamburger Fremdenblatt, which
</p>
<p>272 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>shows how Germany, through socialistic agents throughout
</p>
<p>the rest of the world, intends to wage a new warfare for the
</p>
<p>ultimate triumph of German Kultur. This German news-
</p>
<p>paper puts the doctrine in the mouth of a Japanese, adding
</p>
<p>that it is of 'special interest because of its correspondence
</p>
<p>with the programme of Count Brockdorff-Rantzau'. The
</p>
<p>article reads:
</p>
<p>" 'This convenient Japanese declares that the real cause
</p>
<p>of the war was the incomparable energy of a single Power,
</p>
<p>shut up in a grey corner of Europe and striving towards the
</p>
<p>sun. German militarism was a protest against English capit-
</p>
<p>alism, whose effort to throttle the world it opposed. Militar-
</p>
<p>ism failed, but the new Germany must resume the old war
</p>
<p>with new weapons.
</p>
<p>" 'These are to be found in democracy, the deadly enemy
</p>
<p>of capitalism. Germany is the country of work. England
</p>
<p>and America are the countries where capitalism makes other
</p>
<p>people work. A Japanese coming from England or America
</p>
<p>to Germany at once feels that he has come home from foreign
</p>
<p>lands. The world is not yet ripe for international socialism,
</p>
<p>and Germany is the leader of national socialism.
</p>
<p>" 'She will speedily convert Russia to the same idea, and
</p>
<p>then the Balkan States, Egypt, India, Mexico, and the South
</p>
<p>American States will join the union of nationalist socialism,
</p>
<p>led by Germany, to destroy Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Japan
</p>
<p>must cease to follow England and adopt the German ideal.
</p>
<p>As a first testimony of her good faith she will return Tsing-
</p>
<p>tau to China. Then, presumably with the help of Germany,
</p>
<p>Japan will assist China to throw out English capitalism.'
</p>
<p>"There you are," said the Britisher. "The old Germany,
</p>
<p>the imperialistic Germany, is still unconquered. The men
</p>
<p>who were most active in the old propaganda plots and who
</p>
<p>proved that propaganda is often more powerful than cannon

</p>
<p>Americans through various newspapers which were his dupes,
</p>
<p>or which through sales of bonds and other secret subsidies
</p>
<p>prostituted themselves completely to German gold, is still
</p>
<p>powerful in the councils of the new Germany."
</p>
<p>"Germany today is spending more money for propaganda
</p>
<p>to defeat the peace treaty, to break up the League of Nations,
</p>
<p>to 'embarass the Allies in every conceivable way, than ever be-
</p>
<p>fore," interposed the French officer. "One of the first acts
</p>
<p>of the Weimer National Assembly after the armistice was to
</p>
<p>plan a world wide propaganda campaign. On March 29 it
</p>
<p>voted an unlimited appropriation for the further extension
</p>
<p>of a commercial news service abroad. This money is now
</p>
<p>being used to aid the Sinn Feiners and the Egyptian and
</p>
<p>Indian nationalists. Proof has been obtained by represen-
</p>
<p>tatives of the Allied governments in Switzerland. Indeed,
</p>
<p>the same agencies that Germany used in Switzerland during
</p>
<p>the war to spread the pestilence of defeatism throughout
</p>
<p>France and Italy are now seeking to infect the French, the
</p>
<p>Italians, the British and the Americans with these new plag-
</p>
<p>ues.
</p>
<p>"Only a glance at some of the Swiss papers shows how
</p>
<p>boldly these propagandists are operating. For example, here
</p>
<p>is an article from the German Swiss Neue Zurcher Zeitung of
</p>
<p>May 27, on 'The Situation in Ireland'. It says that Ireland
</p>
<p>must break away from the bondage of England and become
</p>
<p>a republic. The article is signed, the 'Komitee der Freunde
</p>
<p>fiir Irische Freiheit.' (The Committee of the Friends of
</p>
<p>Irish Freedom).
</p>
<p>"At Berne there has been established an Oriental League.
</p>
<p>In it have been combined all the secret Moslem and Hindu
</p>
<p>nationalistic organizations, which hitherto have been work-
</p>
<p>ing separately to break up the British Empire. Among them
</p>
<p>is the 'Pro India' group, of which a number of leaders were

<p>274 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>"The purpose of the new organization is to promote a
</p>
<p>world wide revolution of Mohammedanism against England
</p>
<p>and France, as soon as the peace treaty has been ratified by
</p>
<p>the various Allied countries.
</p>
<p>"The master mind behind the Oriental League is Baron
</p>
<p>von Wesendonck, at one time Director of the Oriental De-
</p>
<p>partment of the Berlin Foreign Office. Assisting him are
</p>
<p>three Young Turks, Enver, Talaat and Djemal. Branches
</p>
<p>have been founded in India, Afghanistan, Turkestan, Persia,
</p>
<p>Turco-Tartary, Egypt, Algeria and Morrocco."
</p>
<p>"You spoke of the instigation of labor troubles in Allied
</p>
<p>countries by German propaganda," said the American.
</p>
<p>"Have you proof that the epidemic of strikes and lockouts
</p>
<p>in the United States has been incited by German agents?"
</p>
<p>"I can only speak of France," replied the Frenchman,
</p>
<p>"and here there is proof aplenty. The same French labor
</p>
<p>leaders who tried to cripple French munition factories and
</p>
<p>other war manufactories before the armistice are now spread-
</p>
<p>ing the flames of socialism and Bolshevism throughout all
</p>
<p>our working classes."
</p>
<p>"How far did these labor agitators succeed in working
</p>
<p>for the defeat of France?" asked the Britisher.
</p>
<p>"In the Department of the Loire and neighboring indus-
</p>
<p>trial regions the trade unionists voted a general strike and a
</p>
<p>revolution, unless France signed an immediate armistice. That
</p>
<p>was on May 23 1918, four days before the third great Ger-
</p>
<p>man drive, which smashed through the allied front for
</p>
<p>thirty miles between Soissons and Rheims. It was the most
</p>
<p>critical time of the whole war.
</p>
<p>"Forty-one Syndicalists, nearly all belonging to the Loire,
</p>
<p>were finally brought to trial before the court martial at

<p>Clermont-Ferrand. Chief of the accused was Andrieux,

</p>
<p>"But that was during the war," said the American. "Who
</p>
<p>is making trouble now? Who is responsible for your present
</p>
<p>labor outbreaks?"
</p>
<p>"Such socialists as Jean Longuet, grandson of Karl Marx,
</p>
<p>the founder of German socialism, of whom you, yourself,
</p>
<p>spoke a little while ago," replied the French officer. "Lon-
</p>
<p>guet, Deputy of the Seine, and M. Frossard, Secretary Gen-
</p>
<p>eral of the Socialist Party, work together. Only the other
</p>
<p>day these two men were arrested at Folkestone, England, by
</p>
<p>the British police. They were on their way to the annual
</p>
<p>conference of the British Labor Party at Southport. The
</p>
<p>British authorities, as Mr. Short declared in the House of
</p>
<p>Commons, had obtained proofs of a Bolshevik movement in
</p>
<p>England. Let me read you what the Echo de Paris said
</p>
<p>about it", and picking up a newspaper from the table, he
</p>
<p>read :
</p>
<p>" 'Longuet and Frossard have been treated not as defenders
</p>
<p>of the proletariat but of the German revolution and peace,
</p>
<p>not as labor delegates but as international agitators.
</p>
<p>" 'For days and weeks at their meetings and in their news-
</p>
<p>papers these men have pleaded the German cause. Con-
</p>
<p>tinually they cry for peace terms most favorable to the Huns.'
</p>
<p>"In the Action Francaise of yesterday, Leon Daudet re-
</p>
<p>produced passages of a letter in which the German naval at-
</p>
<p>tache at Madrid said he could 'approach at all times' the
</p>
<p>French socialists through Longuet. The attache was quoted
</p>
<p>as asking if he should continue the propaganda and keep in

</p>
<p>ting a new campaign of economic and political strikes which
</p>
<p>276 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>would lead to a general Bolshevik strike. It was to take ef-
</p>
<p>fect upon the promulgation of the treaty.'
</p>
<p>"Two documents are in the possession of the French milit-
</p>
<p>ary authorities," continued the French Colonel, "which re-
</p>
<p>veal still further how bold the new German propagandists
</p>
<p>have become. The first document showed that on November
</p>
<p>21, 1918, ten days after the armistice, the German military
</p>
<p>attache at Madrid proposed to Berlin a plan of Bolshevik
</p>
<p>revolution in France. 'If impossible to start an insurrection
</p>
<p>all over France,' he added, 'try only a section of the country.
</p>
<p>This will be enough to frighten the Clemenceau government
</p>
<p>and force it to recognize the wishes of the socialists con-
</p>
<p>cerning the conditions of peace.'
</p>
<p>"The second document was seized in Poland. It was an
</p>
<p>official German diplomatic paper, number 1912, in which the
</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs urged the Minister of War to
</p>
<p>recruit Germans who were able to speak French and English,
</p>
<p>for a special course of instruction at the German War Min-
</p>
<p>istry. There they should receive all the training and in-
</p>
<p>struction necessary for Bolshevik propaganda in France and
</p>
<p>England. It was signed, 'Reusche, Capt. Stopp.' '
</p>
<p>"The war is by no means over," remarked the Britisher.
</p>
<p>"Exactly what Clemenceau said," returned the Frenchman.
</p>
<p>"Let me read you what he stated recently on this very

<p>subject:
</p>
<p>" 'There is only a lull in the storm. Recent disclosures
</p>
<p>have enabled us to look deeper into the purposes of the enemy
</p>
<p>than heretofore. It was not purely a dream of military do-
</p>
<p>mination on the part of Prussia. It was a definitely cal-
</p>
<p>culated conspiracy to exterminate France industrially and

<p>commercially, as well as in the field of battle. In that effort

<p>the German bankers and manufacturers joined the General

<p>this clear. And this fact also explains many of the activities
</p>
<p>of the German armies, which at first we could not understand.
</p>
<p>We now see why they stole the machinery from our factories,
</p>
<p>why they destroyed the coal mines of Lens, why they wrought
</p>
<p>such wanton devastation on French territory, even in retreat.
</p>
<p>It was then thought to be the tactics of military frightful-
</p>
<p>ness. Instead, it was part of a deliberate plan of commercial
</p>
<p>imperialism.
</p>
<p>" *And in this phase of the war Germany has not been un-
</p>
<p>successful. The industrial life of France has been so wreck-
</p>
<p>ed that its resusitation is most difficult, while by reason of
</p>
<p>her military surrender, Germany has saved her factories in-
</p>
<p>tact and ready for immediate and efficient operation. In-
</p>
<p>dustrially and commercially Germany conquered France. For
</p>
<p>the present the victory is with the Hun.' '
</p>
<p>"But the military power of Germany has been crushed,"
</p>
<p>said the American, as if asking a question.
</p>
<p>"Clemenceau does not think so," replied the French officer.
</p>
<p>"He says, 'There are features of the military triumph over
</p>
<p>Germany, which are most disquieting for France. With the

<p>British army demobilized, the American army home, there
</p>
<p>might be a reopening of the military debate by Germany,

<p>which would embarass us, were it not for the assurance of

<p>President Wilson.' "
</p>
<p>"Well, under the Franco- American treaty, which President

<p>Wilson is taking back to Washington, the United States is

<p>bound to assist France in case of any unprovoked act of

</p>
<p>and the United States of maintaining large armaments for the

<p>peace of the world", said the Britisher. "If the League of

<p>Nations is destroyed, as Germany and her friends desire, the

<p>responsibility of preventing the next war will fall largely

<p>upon the English and French speaking peoples. Therefore,

<p>I cannot understand why some American Senators would tear

<p>the treaty to pieces, why they would smash the League of

<p>Nations and alienate all the rest of the Allies.
</p>
<p>"England has made a treaty with France, almost identical

<p>Colonel. "The United States has already proved its utter

<p>to get this seaport, that group of islands, this protectorate

<p>or that sphere of influence. No. It went to Europe, as the

</p>
<p>a churchman, but I always find an inspiration in the sublime
</p>
<p>cathedral."
</p>
<p>"Let us meet you there," replied the American. "Just the
</p>
<p>thing. I too have been wanting to see Notre Dame again."
</p>
<p>And so it was agreed that all three should meet at the
</p>
<p>Porte de la Vierge, (the Door of the Virgin), the most north-
</p>
<p>ern of the three great entrances of the cathederal, at ten
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>The American Colonel arrived at the appointed place a
</p>
<p>little before the time. He stood beneath the sculptured arch-
</p>
<p>way and watched the black line of women entering. Although
</p>
<p>upon the battle field he had gone into the jaws of death,
</p>
<p>although he had fought over heaps of dead and dying men,
</p>
<p>yet never before had he realized so profoundly the ghastliness
</p>
<p>of war. Everyone who passed him walked beneath the shad-
</p>
<p>ow of the grave.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the faces of these mourners, he saw a calm
</p>
<p>faith, an undying hopefulness, which filled him with wonder.
</p>
<p>With mute lips the women seemed to say :
</p>
<p>"They have killed our fathers.
</p>
<p>"They have killed our brothers.
</p>
<p>"They have killed our husbands.
</p>
<p>"They have killed our sons.
</p>
<p>"But France, they cannot kill."
</p>
<p>As one woman approached him, a white paper fluttered to

<p>his feet. He was too absorbed to notice it, until she had en-
</p>
<p>THE ENEMY WITHIN 281
</p>
<p>tered the door and was lost in the great shadowy depths far
</p>
<p>beyond.
</p>
<p>It was a letter ; and before he realized what he was doing,
</p>
<p>he read:
</p>
<p>"Dearest Marie: The wound was too deep. I can only
</p>
<p>tell you I am happy in knowing I could fight for France. I
</p>
<p>love you and the baby with all my soul. God will care for
</p>
<p>you both.
</p>
<p>Your Jean."
</p>
<p>The letter was dated September 20, 1914, the eighth week
</p>
<p>of the war. The American was just about to renew his
</p>
<p>search, when a figure in heavy crepe, leading a little child,
</p>
<p>hurried out of the "Door of the Virgin," and gazed around in
</p>
<p>a frightened, bewildered way at the long black line, that was
</p>
<p>still entering. He knew in an instant that it was the "Marie"
</p>
<p>of the letter. He ran to her side and held out the little piece
</p>
<p>of paper.
</p>
<p>"Oh, how I thank you, Monsieur," the woman cried, and
</p>
<p>kissing the crumpled letter, she thrust it back into her bosom.

<p>"What they feaired was the publication of the report by Victor Fabre
</p>
<p>on the Rochette swindle and the full exposure of Caillaux's alliance
</p>
<p>with Germany."
</p>
<p>Gaston Calmette obtained possession of copies of telegrams between
</p>
<p>Baron Schoen, German Ambassador at Paris, and Bethmann-Hollweg,
</p>
<p>Chancellor of Germany, discussing Caillaux's efforts to surrender France
</p>
<p>to German interests by means of secret negociations during the Agadir
</p>
<p>embroglio in 1911, when Caillaux was Premier. These dispatches show
</p>
<p>that Caillaux was willing to cede vast African possessions to Germany,
</p>
<p>but feared the wrath of French public opinion. They also show that
</p>
<p>every effort was made to keep Caillaux's machinations away from the
</p>
<p>knowledge of Jules Cambon, then French Ambassador at Berlin,
</p>
<p>When Caillaux learned that Calmette in 1914 was preparing to pub-
</p>
<p>lish these telegrams, he persuaded Premier Doumergue to ask Calmette
</p>
<p>to desist. Calmette was told that their publication would endanger the
</p>
<p>safety of France. Calmette replied, that if it was a question of patriot-
</p>
<p>ism, he would not make the information public.
</p>
<p>During the trial of Mme. Caillaux for the murder of Calmette, M.
</p>
<p>Herbaux, the Prosecutor General, who was a friend of Caillaux and
</p>
<p>who had been appointed to succeed another prosecutor hostile to the
</p>
<p>husband of the murderess, sought to suppress this phase of the affair.
</p>
<p>He said he was authorized to deny the existence of the Schoen Beth-
</p>
<p>mann-Hollweg telegrams.
</p>
<p>This all important correspondence, however, has at last come to light.
</p>
<p>The copies which Calmette possessed were turned over by his estate to
</p>
<p>President Poincare. They were placed in the Caillaux dossier, which
</p>
<p>was produced before the Commission of Inquiry of the High Court,

<p>which is to try Caillaux. Because these copies are of green paper, they
</p>
<p>have come to be called Les Documents Verts, (The Green Documents).
</p>
<p>The three most important telegrams among these papers, which it is
</p>
<p>now possible to reproduce, read as follows:
</p>
<p>(Document No. 1)
</p>
<p>"No. 210. Secret.
</p>
<p>"Paris, July 26, 1911, 15th hour.
</p>
<p>"Foreign Affairs, Berlin.
</p>
<p>"Fondere, who yesterday and today had long conversations wltfc
</p>
<p>283
</p>
<p>284 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>Caillaux, says that Caillaux stated the cession of the whole coast of the
</p>
<p>Congo was altogether impossible. Public opinion would interpret it as
</p>
<p>an abasement of France, and as for Caillaux, himself, it would mean
</p>
<p>political suicide.
</p>
<p>"Caillaux pretends to despair of the possibility of coming to an agree-
</p>
<p>ment with us, and adds that he is beginning to see the future grow
</p>
<p>dark. In the discussion between Fondere and Caillaux relative to com-
</p>
<p>pensations, the President of the Council (Caillaux) called attention to
</p>
<p>the resistance which England might offer to important territorial con-
</p>
<p>cessions made to us (Germany).
</p>
<p>"But at the same time he expressed the opinion that France vould
</p>
<p>cede to us, even against the wish of Great Britain, the territory ot the
</p>
<p>French Congo east of the Kameroon with the Sangha as a new frontier
</p>
<p>on the south as far as the Congo River. Besides, Caillaux has also ex-
</p>
<p>pressed the opinion. .. .that France through a secret treaty could cede
</p>
<p>to us her right of preemption to the Belgian Congo. As for Togo,
</p>
<p>France thinks it is out of the question, because the Secretary of State
</p>
<p>for Foreign Affairs has declared to Cambon that our Bureau of Col-
</p>
<p>onies could not consent to the relinquishment of that colony.
</p>
<p>"In order to make this agreement look as much as possible like a
</p>
<p>colonial barter instead of a concession wrested by Germany at Agadir,
</p>
<p>Caillaux wished to have from Germany as a counterpart for France
</p>
<p>the most northern extremity of the Kameroon on the River Tchad and
</p>
<p>another very small territory north of the Togo.
</p>
<p>"Thus, at a later favorable moment, we could perhaps, in the opinion
</p>
<p>of Cailla.ux, exchange the coast of the French Congo for the Togo.
</p>
<p>The reply has been made to M. Fondere that no agreement on such a
</p>
<p>basis could be discussed. Fondere thinks that Caillaux will perhaps
</p>
<p>compromise finally in the following manner.
</p>
<p>"Cession of the south coast of Spanish Guinea with the port of Muni,
</p>
<p>which has great future possibilities, as far as a little to the north of
</p>
<p>Libreville. Such an arrangement England would oppose with all her
</p>
<p>might. The southern frontier in this case would reach as far as Ogooue
</p>
<p>toward the south east, which is nearly as far as Franceville. Thence

</p>
<p>it would run along the Alima River.
</p>
<p>"Fondere may see Caillaux at any moment. Caillaux appreciates him
</p>
<p>as a colonial expert. He is placing himself at our disposal. In pre-
</p>
<p>tending that the cession of the entire coast of the Congo would greatly
</p>
<p>irritate French public opinion, which has already been apparently ex-
</p>
<p>cited against us on several occasions by England, Caillaux, in my
</p>
<p>opinion, is sincere."

<p>"Caillaux has instructed Fondere to advise our Embassy that he is
</p>
<p>animated with a sincere desire to have an understanding with us, and
</p>
<p>thzrt he would prefer to bring about an entente on a big scale, settling
</p>
<p>all the difficulties which have arisen between us in recent years. This
</p>
<p>would help him justify himself before the public in making this cession

<p>APPENDIX 285
</p>
<p>of colonial territory. Thus he can show the eminent advantage of
</p>
<p>smoothing out all old time points of dispute.
</p>
<p>"The broader the entente will be, the more objects of different kinds
</p>
<p>it will embrace, and the more France will show herself willing to accede
</p>
<p>to colonial concessions; while on the other hand a barter limited to
</p>
<p>Morocco and the Congo would cause here a sense of humiliation and
</p>
<p>could hardly be carried out in a form satisfactory to us.
</p>
<p>"Caillaux asks that we, Germans, ask ourselves just whatwe want in
</p>
<p>settling every point of dispute. He consents to although these are
</p>
<p>trivial concessions a German president for the Ottoman debt, a thirty
</p>
<p>per cent, retrocession for the Bagdad railroad, and an arrangement cov-
</p>
<p>ering the railroads of the Orient.
</p>
<p>"He has also considered the cession to us of the French possessions
</p>
<p>in Oceania.

<p>"I am sending you tomorrow noon the counsellor of this embassy to

<p>on the very eve of the war to obtain the promise of the French Social-
</p>
<p>ists, that they would refuse to vote war credits in case of a conflict
</p>
<p>between France and Germany. He arrived in Paris August 1, 1914. At
</p>
<p>Brussels he had been joined by Lt. Henry de Man, a Belgian labor
</p>
<p>leader, and Camille Huysmans, secretary of the International Socialist
</p>
<p>Bureau. All three went to the French capital together.
</p>
<p>Miiller talked with the Socialist Deputies first in the Chamber of
</p>
<p>Deputies and later at the office of the Socialist newspaper, PHumanitt
</p>
<p>According to de Man, in the New York Times, of June 29, 1918, Muller
</p>
<p>told the French Socialists he had been sent by the German
</p>
<p>Democracy "to make a last attempt to prevent the war by deciding on
</p>
<p>a common course of action by the French and German Socialists,
</p>
<p>had no authority to pledge his party to any definite course, as t
</p>
<p>exact circumstances at the time of the prospective meeting
</p>
<p>Reichstag could not yet be foreseen, but he was authorized to expla
</p>
<p>the situation and his party's views at the time wher i he : had left Berli
</p>
<p>(July 31). In the light of this information he said the French Socialii
</p>
<p>286 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>might find it easier to determine their own attitude, should the question
</p>
<p>of war credits be put to them. He would take back to Berlin the in-
</p>
<p>formation which they would give him.
</p>
<p>"He gave an optimistic account of the state of affairs in Germany
</p>
<p>He said he knew nothing about a general mobilization of the German
</p>
<p>Army, the rumor of which had been spread in Paris that morning. The
</p>
<p>state of danger of war' (.Kriegsgefahrzustand), which had been de-
</p>
<p>clared on July 31, he called a comparatively harmless measure. As
</p>
<p>Herr Haase had done at the meeting of the International Socialist
</p>
<p>Bureau in Brussels four days earlier, he laid much stress on what he
</p>
<p>called the underhand encouragement given by the Imperial Chancellor
</p>
<p>to the anti-war demonstrations and the alleged desire of the Kaiser to
</p>
<p>maintain peace.
</p>
<p>"As to the Social Democratic Party, Miiller said, it would on no
</p>
<p>account vote in favor of any war credits. 'Dass man fur die Krieg-
</p>
<p>skrvdite stimmt, das halte ich fur ausgeschlosscn was his deflinite, re-
</p>
<p>peated statement. A fraction, probably a small minority, might favor
</p>
<p>abstention from voting, with a view to the danger from Russia, but
</p>
<p>Miiller declared that he himself did not share the latter view and that
</p>
<p>he thought an unanimous vote against the war credits probable, espec-
</p>
<p>ially if the French Socialists decided to follow a similar course.
</p>
<p>"Discussion made it appear that the French showed little inclination
</p>
<p>to follow this suggestion. Miiller got plenty of evidence notably from
</p>
<p>Marcel Sembat and Pierre Renaudel that the earnest desire of the
</p>
<p>French Government to maintain peace and, should France be attacked,
</p>
<p>to remain on the defensive, was above suspicion. Reference was made
</p>
<p>to the decision of the Viviani Cabinet to withdraw all French troops
</p>
<p>within ten kilometres from the frontier, so as to avoid provocations and
</p>
<p>clearly demonstrate France's good will. Muller was also told of the
</p>
<p>repeated attempts of the French Government to induce Russia to a
</p>
<p>similar policy of moderation, attempts in which Jean Jaures, who had
</p>
<p>been assassinated the night before, had taken a leading part until a
</p>
<p>few minutes before his death. Under these circumstances the majority
</p>
<p>of the French Socialists would not refuse the war credits which the

</p>
<p>Government would need should France be attacked. A minority seemed
</p>
<p>to favor abstention as a means to demonstrate that the Socialist Party
</p>
<p>refused any responsibility for the consequences of a system of interna-
</p>
<p>tional competitive armament which it had always opposed.
</p>
<p>"A lengthy discussion followed, in which Muller repeatedly insisted
</p>
<p>on the desirability of a common policy. His main argument was the
</p>
<p>view which had always been advocated by August Bebel, that the dis-
</p>
<p>tinction between the attacking power and the attacked was obsolete.
</p>
<p>..he history of all modern wars, he said, showed that they were due
</p>
<p>to general causes inherent to the economic development of capitalism
</p>
<p>in its imperialistic stage, and that it was usually impossible to know
</p>
<p>the truth about the actual incidents that led to the declaration of war
</p>
<p>until it was all over. (This argument, by the way, was repeated by
</p>
<p>Hermann Muller at the International Socialist Conference in Berne in
</p>
<p>February last, to justify his party's refusal to admit Germany's guilt as
</p>
<p>the attacking power.) Consequently, he could see no reason why the
</p>
<p>attitude of the French Socialists should be different from that of their
</p>
<p>German comrades.
</p>
<p>APPENDIX 287
</p>
<p>"No formal decision was arrived at, but the "information 1 ' Miiller
</p>
<p>had to take home was to the effect that the French Socialists were not
</p>
<p>to be induced to refuse their Government the war credits, and that the
</p>
<p>theonly chance of a possible common policy consisted in abstention from
</p>
<p>voting on both sides."
</p>
<p>Miiller quit France that night and boarded a train at Brussels for
</p>
<p>Berlin two hours before the Germans handed their ultimatum to
</p>
<p>Belgium.
</p>
<p>On August 4, 1914, the German Social Democracy completely repud-
</p>
<p>iated Muller's representations and in a session of the Reichstag that
</p>
<p>same day voted the war credits which the Kaiser had demanded?

<p>ularly in the villages where food was scanty and complaints against
</p>
<p>the conduct of the war were numerous. The propaganda extended from
</p>
<p>the civilian population to the army, and its channel was directed main-
</p>
<p>toward the Second Army encamped along the Isonzo River.
</p>
<p>"As a consequence of the pacifists' preachments both by word of
</p>
<p>mouth and document, the Second Army was ready for the friendly
</p>
<p>approaches that came from the front lines of the Austrians only a
</p>
<p>few yards away. Daily communication was established and at night
</p>
<p>the opposing soldiers fraternized generally. The Russian doctrine, that
</p>
<p>an end of the fighting would come if the soldiers agreed to do nol
</p>
<p>more shooting spread through the Italian trenches.
</p>
<p>"This was all a part of a plan carefully mapped out by the German
</p>
<p>High Command. When the infection had spread, the fraternizing Aust-
</p>
<p>rian troops were withdrawn from the front trenches and German shock
</p>
<p>troops took their places. On Oct. 24, 1917, these troops attacked in
</p>
<p>288 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>force. The Italians in the front line, mistaking them for the friendly
</p>
<p>Austrians, waived a greeting. German machine guns and rifles replied
</p>
<p>with a deadly fire, and the great flanking movement had begun. So well
</p>
<p>had the Germans playe'd their game that the Italians lost more than
</p>
<p>250,000 prisoners and 2,300 guns the first week. The Italian positions
</p>
<p>at Tolmipo and Plezzo were captured and the whole Italian force was
</p>
<p>compelled to retreat along a seventy mile front from the Carnic Alps
</p>
<p>to the sea. The most important point gained by the enemy in its
</p>
<p>early assault was the village of Caporetto on the Upper Isonzo, The
</p>
<p>Italian retreat at places degenerated into a rout and it was not until
</p>
<p>the Italians, reinforced by French and British, reached the Piave River,
</p>
<p>that a stand was finally made." (March's History of the World War.)

<p>cording to Charles Edward Russell, in "Bolshevism and the United

<p>go on a general strike until their respective governments should be
</p>
<p>willing to sign a peace treaty. Whether Germany was to surrender
</p>
<p>the territory she had grabbed was not made clear, but anyway, no
</p>
<p>annexations, no indemnities, not even for mutilated Belgium.
</p>
<p>"That was the origin of that famous phrase that presently went
</p>
<p>echoing around the world. I have no doubt Lenine himself invented
</p>
<p>it. In the original it was 'no annexations, no contributions', but, as
</p>
<p>nobody was able to guess what that might mean, those that helped to
</p>
<p>speed it on its way amended it into its more familiar form.
</p>
<p>"But Zimmerwald, while it made trouble, failed to make peace. The
</p>
<p>next year he (Lenine) repeated the attempt with a similar congress at
</p>
<p>Kienthal, similar attended and with similar results."
</p>
<p>One of the French delegates to Zimmerwald was Jean Longuet,
</p>
<p>grandson of Karl Marx, the founder of German socialism. Longuet is a
</p>
<p>Paris Deputy. (See Chapter XXI.)

<p>"Lenoir was condemned to death." 1 The dramatic escape early this
</p>
<p>morning of Pierre Lenoir from death at the hands of a firing squad in
</p>
<p>the Vincennes woods was the subject of lively conversations in political
</p>
<p>circles today. Lenoir had been tried with Senator Humbert and other
</p>
<p>defendants for having communicated military intelligence to the enemy
</p>
<p>and was sentenced to death.
</p>
<p>The firing squad already had taken its place and preparations were
</p>
<p>being made to escort Lenoir out to meet death from a volley of the
</p>
<p>riflemen when the condemned man begged to be confronted with former
</p>
<p>Premier Caillaux, who is under charges similar to those on which Lenoir
</p>
<p>was convicted. The execution was suspended and the condemned man
</p>
<p>remained in his cell. . . .
</p>
<p>In connection with the reprieve of Lenoir it may be remembered that
</p>
<p>Bolo Pacha succeeded in postponing his execution ten days while making
</p>
<p>revelations.

<p>(Associated Press dispatch, published in the New York Herald of

</p>
<p>On Oct. 24, 1919, Lenoir was executed at La Sante. He was suffering

<p>from paralysis in both legs, and had to be carried to the place of

<p>inspecting documents, held the final interrogatory of the accused. The

<p>formalities prior to Ihe trial were ^hereupon ended.
</p>
<p>On July 30, the trial of Caillaux was recommended by Theodore
</p>
<p>Lescouyre, Attorney General of the French Republic, in a report filed
</p>
<p>with the commission of inquiry. It was then stated that Lt. Mornet,
</p>
<p>who prosecuted Bolo and the Bonnet Rouge gang, would assist M.
</p>
<p>Lescouvre in the prosecution of Caillaux.
</p>
<p>On August 2 Edouard Ignace, Under Secretary for Military Justice,
</p>
<p>declared that all documents relating to the prosecuion of Caillaux had
</p>
<p>been turned over to the High Court. His statement was in reply to
</p>
<p>the petition of counsel for Caillaux to Premier Clemenceau, that letters
</p>
<p>between Deputy Attorney General Becker of New York State and M.
</p>
<p>Jusserand, French Ambassador to the United States, be incorporated
</p>
<p>in the Caillaux dossier. M. Ignace also added that the Becker-Jusser-
</p>
<p>and correspondence had not reached him, and suggested that the petit-
</p>
<p>ioners were free to apply for its production by legal means.
</p>
<p>On September 9 the Temps announced that Caillaux would be per-
</p>
<p>290 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>mitted to leave La Sante for a sanitarium. His counsel had applied
</p>
<p>for his removal from prison on the ground that his health had been
</p>
<p>impaired by anxiety and long confinement. On the same day, Walter
</p>
<p>Duranty, Paris correspondent of the New York Times cabled:
</p>
<p>"It is possible that the Government may use Caillaux's ill health
</p>
<p>which is genuine enough, whether or not it is due, as his friends assert,
</p>
<p>to the year and a half confinement he has undergone, as a pretext for
</p>
<p>letting the case drop altogether.
</p>
<p>"His friends who are more numerous and much more devoted than
</p>
<p>may be realized in America say that some such conclusion as this
</p>
<p>would be fully in accord with Clernenceau's action in keeping his most
</p>
<p>dangerous opponent a year and a half in prison without trial, because
</p>
<p>he knew that the prosecution would utterly break down if put to a real
</p>
<p>test."
</p>
<p>On September 13, Caillaux was transferred from La Sante to a private
</p>
<p>hospital at Neuilly, suburb of Paris.
</p>
<p>On September 16, the commission of inquiry of the High Court, sit-
</p>
<p>ting as a tribunal of accusation, ordered Caillaux to face charges of
</p>
<p>intriguing with the enemy to bring about a premature and dishonorable
</p>
<p>peace. It was decided to discharge Louis Loustalot and Paul Comby,
</p>
<p>who were mixed up in Caillaux's dealings with Cavallini.
</p>
<p>On October 23 the Senate, as a High Court, refused to grant
</p>
<p>Caillaux his petition for provisional liberty and set his trial for
</p>
<p>Jan. 14. 1920.

<p>"How can France have real peace as long as the socialists remain so
</p>
<p>powerful?" There were various groups of socialists in the Chamber
</p>
<p>of Deputies during the war, which varied in size and strength con-
</p>
<p>tinually. Their principles ranged from those of true democracy to
</p>
<p>the extremist views of Bolshevism. Because of the combination of
</p>
<p>some and the splitting of other factions on different occasions, it may
</p>
<p>lie said that the socialistic element in the Chamber for the last five
</p>
<p>years has been in a constant state of flux. The United Socialists,
</p>
<p>formerly led by Jaures, have held together with the greatest cohesion.

<p>Recently, however, a number of them have become alarmed at the
</p>
<p>radical tendency of their leaders, and have declared that the present
</p>
<p>policy of their party would plunge France into the abyss of a proletariat
</p>
<p>dictatorship.
</p>
<p>For example, M. Nectoux, a socialist Deputy of Paris, and M. Erlich,
</p>
<p>a socialist candidate for the Chamber of Deputies in 1914, resigned
</p>
<p>from the United Socialist party on August 29, 1919, because, they said,
</p>
<p>its doctrines too much resembled those of Lenine.

<p>"Germany is still fighting for supremacy,.... scheming.. to incite
</p>
<p>class jealousies, to keep att the rest of the world in a ferment..".
</p>
<p>"For a number of years prior to our entry into the world war a -rents
</p>
<p>of the German Government persistently carried on a great propaganda
</p>
<p>in the United States, the purpose of which was to promote the in-
</p>
<p>APPENDIX 291
</p>
<p>terests of the German Government and to create a sentiment in this
</p>
<p>country in favor of that Government to the prejudice of this nation.
</p>
<p>Every activity which tended to weaken our Government or to arouse
</p>
<p>antagonisms that would demoralize the unity and morale of our popul-
</p>
<p>ation and every movement that was aimed at involving us in foreign
</p>
<p>disputes or domestic difficulties was encouraged and frequently financed
</p>
<p>by the agents and representatives of the German Government.
</p>
<p>'Today the forces of anarchy and violence are utilizing the financial
</p>
<p>resources plundered by them from the European people they have
</p>
<p>succeeded in exploiting, to import into this country money, literature,
</p>
<p>and hired agents for the purpose of promulgating the doctrine of force,
</p>
<p>violence, assassination, confiscation, and revolution.
</p>
<p>"As an effect of these activities there has appeared in this country a
</p>
<p>large group of persons who advocate the overthrow of all organized
</p>
<p>government, and especially the Government of the United States, who
</p>
<p>favor revolutionary movements, repudiate the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States, and refuse to respect our national emblem and our governmental
</p>
<p>institutions. There are found among the leaders of this group many
</p>
<p>aliens who unhesitatingly abuse the hospitality which this country has
</p>
<p>extended to them and who because of their leadership are able to retard
</p>
<p>the real Americanization of the more ignorant residents possessing sim-
</p>
<p>ilar racial characteristics. These persons encourage and maintain a
</p>
<p>solidarity of the people of the several foreign tongues which is used
</p>
<p>to create and incite a class hatred that is quickly absorbed by and in-
</p>
<p>corporated into the revolutionary movement led by them. The Alien ele-
</p>
<p>ment in this country is the most susceptible and is the first to adopt
</p>
<p>violence as an effective weapon for supremacy.
</p>
<p>"More reprehensible than the alien element is that class of American
</p>
<p>citizens, whether native born or naturalized, who having obliged them-
</p>
<p>selves to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,
</p>
<p>lightly disregard their responsibilities and promulgate the doctrine that
</p>
<p>the form of Government established by the Constitution should be over-
</p>
<p>thrown and that a Government responsive to a class rather than to all
</p>
<p>the people should be forcibly substituted therefore. It is a significant

<p>fact that almost without exception the persons in this country who are
</p>
<p>today advocating revolution and violence and all of the suffering, pain,
</p>
<p>and Bloodshed incident to such a movement, have during the great
</p>
<p>ttruggle of the last two years undertaken to handicap, check, and ob-

<p>under the pretext that their consciences would not permit them to take

<p>"Berlin was negotiating for the purchase of the Paris newspaper
</p>
<p>I'Eclair."
</p>
<p>When the Germans left Brussels, they abandoned many official papers
</p>
<p>292 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>among which were copies of telegrams and letters between von Jagow,
</p>
<p>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and von der Lancken, Civil
</p>
<p>Governor of Brussels. Agents of the Surete Nationale of Paris, cooper-
</p>
<p>ating with the Belgian authorities, obtained access to these documents
</p>
<p>and uncovered a mass of information revealing various efforts of Ger-
</p>
<p>many to corrupt French opinion through the intermediation of French
</p>
<p>editors and writers.
</p>
<p>One set of papers showed that Alphonse Lenoir, a Paris publicity
</p>
<p>agent, had proposed to Germany the plan of purchasing Le Journal.
</p>
<p>In one communication to von der Lancken von Jagow explained that
</p>
<p>Lenoir was a friend of Caillaux, "and had been mixed up in the Agadir
</p>
<p>affair, in which you yourself took part." Alphonse Lenior was the
</p>
<p>father of Pierre Lenoir, who was tried with Humbert and Desouches,
</p>
<p>and found guilty of treason.
</p>
<p>Proof was also found that Ernest Judet, editor of VEclair had not
</p>
<p>only been negociating for the sale of his newspaper to the enemy for
</p>
<p>2,000,000 francs, but had visited the Pope for the purpose of preventing
</p>
<p>the Vatican from relinquishing his neutral attitude. Mention was made
</p>
<p>of a dinner at which Judet and Caillaux conferred at great length.
</p>
<p>On August 24, the military Governor of Paris ordered the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion of Judet for intelligence with the enemy. Judet had managed a
</p>
<p>Paris journal, called VEclair for many years. In 1917 he sold this
</p>
<p>newspaper and went to Switzerland. At the time he was criticized for
</p>
<p>having given his children into the hands of German educators aud
</p>
<p>of being intimate with various personages who were enemies of France.
</p>
<p>The Judet affair, however, had never come to the official notice of
</p>
<p>the French government, until a telegram was discovered among the
</p>
<p>papers left by von der Lancken in Brussels, which read:
</p>
<p>DISPATCH
</p>
<p>"From the office of Foreign Affairs, Berlin, 11,12,1914, 1 a.m., to the
</p>
<p>High Commissioner, von der Lancken, Brussels. (Arrived, 11, 12, 1914,
</p>
<p>9 a.m.)

<p>opinion that the situation is less favorable for us now than four weeks

<p>ago. A change of conditions will not be possible without a great
</p>
<p>German success and a campaign of propaganda more to the point. To
</p>
<p>accomplish this I would wish to engage Judet. He at first declined
</p>
<p>the offers that have been made to him through an intermediary; but
</p>
<p>finally, he consented. He said that he would have to abandon the
</p>
<p>editorshhip of his paper which represented a value of 1,500,000 francs;
</p>
<p>and that he risked losing a private fortune of 500,000 francs. He
</p>
<p>accordingly, demanded 2,000,000 francs. For that sum he would devote
</p>
<p>all his energy to our cause.

<p>Jules Rateau, in I'Avenir, in telling of an interview with the Pope,
</p>
<p>June 2, 1915, wrote:
</p>
<p>"During the three quarters of an hour that we talked, the Pope de-
</p>
<p>fended the policy of neutrality followed by the Vatican since the be-
</p>
<p>ginning of the war; and when I laid special stress on the atrocities
</p>
<p>committed by the Germans, the Pope exclaimed:
</p>
<p>APPENDIX 293
</p>
<p>" 'But how can you wish me to do differently. I am the Pope not
</p>
<p>only of France but all Christendom. Therefore, how can I cast a de-

</p>
<p>days ago, a Frenchman, a very important Frenchman told me that in
</p>
<p>France they were shooting German prisoners.'

<p>recently had had several secret interviews with the Pope."

</p>
<p>"In the United States," remarked the French officer, "Germany hat
</p>
<p>long been fostering an Irish movement."
</p>
<p>Proof of the way Germany stirred up the Irish in the United States
</p>
<p>during the war is furnished by the report of the sub-committee of the
</p>
<p>U. S. Senate Judiciary committee, of which Senator Lee S. Overman is
</p>
<p>chairman, made public June 15, 1919. It told of the activities of Dr.
</p>
<p>Albert, the fiscal agent of the German Empire in New York, and Dr.
</p>
<p>Fuehr, head of its press bureau. It also said:
</p>
<p>"In addition to the German Information News Service, the bureau
</p>
<p>maintained what was known as the Irish Press and News Service. This
</p>
<p>was maintained in separate offices at 42 West Forty-second Street, New
</p>
<p>York City, but was under the control of Dr. Fuehr and his agents. The
</p>
<p>active manager of the Irish Press and News Service for the Germans
</p>
<p>was one James K. Maguire, who, with his corps of assistants, sent out
</p>
<p>news service bulletins two or three times a week to eighteen or twenty-
</p>
<p>newspapers, in many of which he personally was interested, and also to
</p>
<p>various daily newspapers. Copies of all propaganda material supplied
</p>
<p>by the Irish Press and News Service were sent to Dr. Fuehr.
</p>
<p>"Dr. Albert's part in the propaganda work of the German represent-
</p>
<p>atives was to attend conferences with Dr. Fuehr, Dr. Hale, and others,
</p>
<p>advise on the general plan of propaganda, and himself to deliver talks
</p>
<p>and lectures in clubs and in more or less exclusive circles of literary

<p>Those who believe that America may never need to go again to the

<p>will show that the Boches have been in the habit of invading France

<p>every forty years on an average for the last twenty centuries. Justin

<p>McGrath, Paris correspondent of the Universal Service, quoting Louis

<p>Forest, of Lorraine, April 13, 1919, wrote
</p>
<p>"A century before Christ, 300,000 boches invaded France, pillaging,

<p>reoccupied the left bank of the Rhine. Three years later the boches in-

<p>France near Besancon.

<p>"Four years later the boches invaded Belgium. Eight years later the

<p>was totally ravaged. Two years later the boches pillaged as far

<p>as Toulouse, Norbonne and Bordeaux. But my article is getting to be

<p>"The Franco-American Treaty."
</p>
<p>The text of the Franco- American treaty, signed by Clemenceau,
</p>
<p>Pichon, Wilson and Lansing, June 28, 1919, reads as follows:
</p>
<p>Considering that the United States of America and the Government
</p>
<p>of the French Republic are equally animated by a desire to maintain
</p>
<p>the peace of the world, so happily restored by the treaty signed at
</p>
<p>Versailles on June 28, which put an end to the war begun by the ag-
</p>
<p>gression of the German Empire and terminated by the defeat of that
</p>
<p>power, and
</p>
<p>"Considering that the United States of America and the Government
</p>
<p>of the French Republic, fully convinced that an unprovoked aggression
</p>
<p>directed by Germany against France would not only violate at the
</p>
<p>same time the letter and spirit of the Versailles Treaty, to which the
</p>
<p>United States and France are parties, thus exposing France anew to
</p>
<p>the intolerable burden of unprovoked war, but that such aggression on
</p>
<p>the act reputed by the Treaty of Versailles as being against all the
</p>
<p>powers signatory to the treaty and calculated to trouble the peace of
</p>
<p>the world, involving inevitably and directly the States of Europe and
</p>
<p>indirectly the entire world, as experience has amply and unhappily
</p>
<p>demonstrated, and
</p>
<p>"Considering that the United States of America and the Government
</p>
<p>of the French Republic apprehend that the stipulations concerning the
</p>
<p>left bank of the Rhine cannot assure immediately to France, on the one
</p>
<p>hand, and to the United States, on the other, as signatory powers to
</p>
<p>the Treaty of Versailles, appropriate security and protection;
</p>
<p>"Consequently, the United States of America and the Government of
</p>
<p>the French Republic, having decided to conclude a treaty to realize
</p>
<p>these necessary ends, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States
</p>
<p>of America, and Robert Lansing, Secretary of State, specially author-
</p>
<p>ized to that end by the President of the United States of America, and

</p>
<p>of War, and Stephen Pichon, Minister of Foreign Affairs, specially
</p>
<p>authorized to that end by Raymond Poincare, President of the French
</p>
<p>Republic, have agreed upon the following:
</p>
<p>"ARTICLE 1. The following stipulations concerning the left bank
</p>
<p>of the Rhine are contained in the Peace Treaty signed with Germany at
</p>
<p>Versailles, June 28, 1919, by the United States of America, by the
</p>
<p>Government of the French Republic, and by the British Empire, among
</p>
<p>other powers:
</p>
<p>"Article 42. Germany is forbidden to maintain or construct any
</p>
<p>fortifications either on the left bank of the Rhine or on the right bank
</p>
<p>to the west of a line drawn fifty kilometers to the east of the Rhine.
</p>
<p>"Article 43 In the area defined above the maintenance and the
</p>
<p>assembly of armed forces, either permanently or temporarily, and milit-
</p>
<p>ary manoeuvres of any kind, as well as the upkeep of all permanent
</p>
<p>works for mobilization, are in the same way forbidden.
</p>
<p>"Article 44 In case Germany violates in any manner whatever the
</p>
<p>provisions of Articles 42 and 43 she shall be regarded as committing a
</p>
<p>296 THE ENEMY WITHIN
</p>
<p>hostile act against the powers signatory of the present treaty and as
</p>
<p>calculated to disturb the peace of the world.
</p>
<p>"In case these stipulations should not assure immediately to France
</p>
<p>appropriate security and protection, the United States of America shall
</p>
<p>be bound to come immediately to her aid in case of any unprovoked act
</p>
<p>of aggression directed against her by Germany.
</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2 The present treaty, couched in terms analogous to
</p>
<p>those of a treaty concluded on the same date and to the same end*
</p>
<p>between Great Britain and the French Republic, a copy of which i$
</p>
<p>hereto annexed, will not enter into force until the moment when the
</p>
<p>latter is ratified.
</p>
<p>"ARTICLE 3 The present treaty must be submitted to the Council
</p>
<p>of the Society of Nations and must be recognized by the council, de-
</p>
<p>ciding if occasion arise by majority, as an engagement in conformity
</p>
<p>with the covenant of the society. It will remain in force until, upon
</p>
<p>demand of one of the parties to the treaty, the council deciding if
</p>
<p>occasion arise by a majority, finds that the society itself assumes suffi-
</p>
<p>cient protection.
</p>
<p>"ARTICLE 4 The present treaty shall before ratification be sub-
</p>
<p>mitted to the French Parliament for approval and it shall be submitted
</p>
<p>to the Senate of the United States of America at the same time as the
</p>
<p>treaty of Versailles (the German peace treaty) shall be submitted for
</p>
<p>assent to ratification. Ratifications shall be exchanged at the time of
</p>
<p>deposit in Paris of the ratifications of the Treaty of Versailles, or as
</p>
<p>soon afterward as possible."
</p>
<p>The agreement between France and England is similar to the Franco-
</p>
<p>American treaty, except that it provides "that England consents to
</p>
<p>come" to the aid of France, whereas Article 1 of the Franco-American
</p>
<p>treaty reads: "The United States will be bound to come to the aid of
</p>
<p>France immediately". The Franco-British treaty imposes no obligation
</p>
<p>upon uny of the British dominions to send overseas expeditions, unless
</p>
<p>approved by local parliaments.
</p>
<p>Why the Franco-American treaty is necessary.

<p>Senate July 29, 1919, President Wilson said:
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen of the Senate: I take pleasure in laying before you a
</p>
<p>treaty with the Republic of France, the object of which is to secure that
</p>
<p>republic the immediate aid of the United States of America in case of
</p>
<p>any unprovoked movement of aggression against her on the part of
</p>
<p>Germany ....
</p>
<p>"It was signed on the same day with the treaty of peace, and is in-
</p>
<p>tended as a temporary supplement to it. It is believed that the treaty
</p>
<p>of peace with Germany itself provides adequate protection to France
</p>
<p>against aggression from her recent enemy on the east; but the years
</p>
<p>immediately ahead of us contain many incalculable possibilities. The
</p>
<p>covenant of the League of Nations provides for military action for the
</p>
<p>protection of its members only upon advice of the Council of the League
</p>
<p>. advice given, it is to be presumed, only upon deliberation and acted
</p>
<p>upon by each of the Governments of the member States If its own judg-
</p>
<p>ment justifies such action. The object of the special treaty with France
</p>
<p>which I now submit to you is to provide for immediate military assist-
</p>
<p>APPENDIX 297
</p>
<p>ance to France by the United States in case of any unprovoked move-
</p>
<p>ment of aggression against her by Germany without waiting for the
</p>
<p>advice of the Council of the League of Nations that such action will
</p>
<p>be taken. It is to be an arrangement, not independent of the League
</p>
<p>of Nations, but under it.
</p>
<p>"It is, therefore, expressly provided that this treaty shall be made
</p>
<p>the subject of consideration at the same time with the treaty of peace
</p>
<p>with Germany; that this special arrangement shall receive the approval
</p>
<p>of the Council of the League; and that this special provision for the
</p>
<p>safety of France shall remain in force only until, upon the application
</p>
<p>of one of the parties to it, the Council of the League, acting, if necessary,
</p>
<p>by a majority vote, shall agree that the provisions of the covenant of the
</p>
<p>League afford her sufficient protection.
</p>
<p>"I was moved to sign this treaty by considerations which will, I hope,
</p>
<p>seem as persuasive and as irresistible to you as they seemed to me. We
</p>
<p>are bound to France by ties of friendship which we have always regard-
</p>
<p>ed, and shall always regard, as peculiarly sacred. She assisted us to win
</p>
<p>our freedom as a nation. It is seriously to be doubted whether we
</p>
<p>could have won it without her gallant and timely aid. We have recently
</p>
<p>had the privilege of assisting in driving enemies, who were also enemies
</p>
<p>of the world, from her soil; but that does not pay our debt to her.
</p>
<p>Nothing can pay such a debt. She now desires that we promise
</p>
<p>to lend our great forces to keep her safe against the power she
</p>
<p>has had most reason to fear Another great nation volunteers the
</p>
<p>same promise. It is one of the fine reversals of history that that
</p>
<p>nation should be the very power from whom France fought
</p>
<p>to set us free. A new day has dawned. Old antagonisms are
</p>
<p>forgotten. The common cause of freedom and enlightenment has
</p>
<p>created a new comradeship and a new perception of what it is wise and
</p>
<p>necessary for great nations to do to free the world of intolerable fear.
</p>
<p>Two Governments who wish to be members of the League of Nations ask
</p>
<p>leave of the Council of the League to be permitted to go to the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of a friend whose situation has been found to be one of peculiar
</p>
<p>peril, without awaiting the advice of the league to act.

<p>"It is by taking such pledges as this that we prove ourselves faithful
</p>
<p>to the utmost to the highest obligations of gratitude and tested friend-
</p>
<p>ship. Such an act as this seems to me one of the proofs that we are a
</p>
<p>people that sees the true heart of duty and prefers honor to its own
</p>
<p>separate course of peace.
