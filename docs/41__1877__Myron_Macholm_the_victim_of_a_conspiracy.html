</p>
<p>Scene 2. The work -shop; the unjust demand; Myron inter-
</p>
<p>viewed; he denies the charge; he makes his statement true and
</p>
<p>faithfully; (Maxwell) his father believes him innocent; they force
</p>
<p>their demand; we will not wait ten minutes; their defiance to old
</p>
<p>Maxwell; he scorns their insolence;, pay up or you shall suffer; by
</p>
<p>the eternal, suffer I will; robbers ! thieves ! blackmailers I begone I.
</p>

</p>
<p> 7
</p>
<p>fore a higher and a merciful Judge; Judge Elcot takes an interest
</p>
<p>in the boy's case, "two weeks in prison is enough for a boy," con-
</p>
<p>victed upon slander evidence; he advises Judge DeWiley to dis'
</p>
<p>charge Myron and cautions his action, he consents reluctantly;
</p>
<p>Myron is discharged; at liberty once more.
</p>
<p>Scene 5. Judge DeWiley in the role of a Co -conspirator, he
</p>
<p>receives ^some filthy lucre, and he partakes of the cursed cup, he
</p>
<p>becomes a Co-conspirator; gentlemen, your wishes shall be com-
</p>
<p>plied with, Myron shall be re-arrested and sent to the Farm.
</p>
<p>ACT III.
</p>
<p>Scene 1. The re-arrest; Myron in durance vile; the sentence
</p>
<p>put into execution; eight years and two months to the Eeform
</p>
<p>Farm; Myron is taken olf by the Sheriff to his new home; can I
</p>
<p>not see my parents once more, and bid them all farewell? he is re-
</p>
<p>fused; they are the orders of the wily Judge,
</p>
<p>Scene 2. Maxwell Macholm is apprised of Myron's re-arrest;
</p>
<p>his appearance in court; is Myron in custody of the Sheriff ? yes;
</p>
<p>and perhaps many miles away; taken away? (Maxwell surprised;) I
</p>
<p>will hasten and apprise my poor wife of this inhuman act; all hope
</p>
<p>gone; the wily Judge triumphant; Fanny Macholm, (Myron's
</p>
<p>mother) appears; she appeals to the Judge on her knees; his con-
</p>
<p>tempt and insolence to her is unbearable; no hope for Myron, and
</p>
<p>no mercy; her wrath knows no bounds, her curse to the Judge; he
</p>
<p>is spell-bound, but langhs in triumph.
</p>
<p>Scene 3. The Eeform Farm; Myron initiated; set to work hoe-
</p>
<p>ing; Myron's soliloquy; he gets the taste of a hickory rod for his
</p>
<p>indiscretion, "Thou shall not stealthy Master's time;" Myron
</p>
<p>gives up all hope; he makes up his mind to serve his time; the
</p>
<p>bell at head quarters; the recess; the supper; the evening vespers;
</p>
<p>inthe chapel; (singing:)" Pull for the Shore," "In the Prison Parni
</p>
<p>We Sit;" &c., &c.; the Lord's prayer; good night.

</p>
<p>starvation; Maxwell's means exhausted; all he can earn goes to
</p>
<p>court and attornies  Tableau ; the evening prayer and song.
</p>
<p>Scene 5. Maxwell Macholm, still hepeful; Myron must be re-
</p>
<p>stored; his last dollar for justice; the highest tribunal; Maxwell as a
</p>
<p>champion of justice; they shall not escape my contempt and way
</p>
<p>revenge; misfortune seldom comes singlehanded; bad tldiugs
</p>
<p>brought to the Father; come home Father quick, poor Ma' is very
</p>
<p>sick; Maxwell gets nervous ! I fear the last chapter of this drama ia
</p>
<p>not written ; God help us.
</p>
<p>ACT lY.
</p>
<p>ScESE 1. (Two months lapse,) bad tidings from the SiapreiE
</p>
<p>Court; they refuse to interfere; the last hope gone; is there no mor
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>hope for poor Maxwell? I fear we are lost; never give up; Maxwell's
</p>
<p>brave heart will not desert him; new found friends appear; they
</p>
<p>are bound to assist Maxwell; "friends in need are friends indeed;"
</p>
<p>the appeal te the Governor; the benefactors indorsement does the
</p>
<p>work; the pardon freely given; Myron is once and forever at liberty.
</p>
<p>Scene 2. The good news sent homo; wife and children are
</p>
<p>happy; his arrival at home; new complications arise; the Mother
</p>
<p>takes a relapse; the new arrival; a boy baby, but life is extinct, it
</p>
<p>is the result of the Mother's grief, the Mother not expected to live.
</p>

</p>
<p>Father's nerves unstrung; he registers a vow; one of the Conspira-
</p>
<p>tors and the Chief Culprit shall pay the penalty of this sad mis-
</p>
<p>fortune; 80 help me; heaven !
</p>
<p>Scene 4. The Wife constitutes herself a pacifyer; it is useless,
</p>
<p>wife; this plot is too strong, the chain must be broken, the chick-
</p>
<p>ens shall come home to roost  die! he shall, at the hands oi an out-
</p>
<p>raged parent; a warning to all evil doers
</p>
<p>ACT Y.
</p>
<p>Scene 1. The funeral; the boy taken to his last resting place;
</p>
<p>the undertaker; one more being without a heart; the Father be-
</p>
<p>gins his work of retribution; revenge and murder the only redress;
</p>
<p>the wite's appeal to desist is not heeded; her prayer for her hus-
</p>
<p>band; the night's storm is fearful, but it is condusive to my plan;
</p>
<p>and it is in conformity with the fearful storm within me.
</p>
<p>Scene 2. The little room in the deserted houe; Maxwell in
</p>
<p>counsel with his co-woker; the stranire document; the plot will

</p>
<p>at midnight; he will not suspect; Hanson my servant, you are

<p>work right, and this trusty steel shall find his black heart.
</p>
<p>Scene 3. Maxwell's return to the humble home; the family in
</p>
<p>sweet slumber; it is nigh unto midnight; and my labor of mercy
</p>
<p>and revenge shall be initiated; it is but one step from virtue to
</p>
<p>vice; but Maxwell shall be true to his vow; come what will; the

</p>
<p>cloak and shovel are brought into use; my poor family; they slum-
</p>
<p>ber sweetly and know not the extent of this moment's work; it
</p>
<p>shall be so ! slumber sweetly dear ones, farewell !
</p>
<p>Scene 4. At the grave-yard; the resurrection; heavy thunder
</p>
<p>and lightning; Maxwell digs for dear life; the cherished treasure
</p>
<p>shall soon be within my embrace; the evidence of his guilt will be

<p>tree; my trusty friend will meet me and bring me good tidings; the
</p>

</p>
<p>friend; our merciful Grovernor; noble men are still in the land 
</p>
<p>thank heaven I

</p>
<p>at twelve the child commands me to fulfill my vow; his brain reels,
</p>
<p>but -will not flinch; Judge DeWiley, the deluded victim arrives;
</p>
<p>Maxwell a changed being; the Judge does not know him; Max-
</p>
<p>well as Dictator; "lie is in my power; these walls shall be his liv-
</p>
<p>ing tomb, and the ceiling his tomb-stone;" the proposition; the
</p>
<p>deed; the death warrant; the denoument; I am Maxwell Macholm,
</p>
<p>thy Execuiioner! Maxwell Macholm? by heaven; my injured vic-
</p>
<p>tim; I am lost I lost !!
</p>
<p>Scene 2. The spirit hour; the proof of his guilt; the tempter;
</p>
<p>the dagger; the apparition; but one moment more and the weapon
</p>
<p>of death is buried within its victim; the spirit angel; the invisible,
</p>
<p>voice; " Father! Father! retribution is mine! desist!"
</p>
<p>Scene 3. Maxwell's reason returns; the staia of blood upon the
</p>
<p>would be victim's forehead; blood ! blood ! ! "I am indeed, a mur-
</p>
<p>derer;" insanity takes place; his reason is dethroned; Maxwell's
</p>
<p>prayer and thanksgiving; 1 am saved and my enemy is avenged;
</p>
<p>the tyrant shall be slain, by his own weapon.
</p>
<p>Scene 4. The Lunatic Asylum; Judge DeWiley, a hopeless
</p>
<p>maniac; his partners in crime tender him a visit; he knows them
</p>
<p>not; his ravings are heart-rending; the tempters; the originators
</p>
<p>of his downfall retreat in shame and supplication; his best friend;
</p>
<p>his wife; she comes; she is almost stricken with grief; his vision
</p>
<p>deserts him; the doctor arrives; poor deluded man, he is gone to
</p>
<p>his Maker! the tyrant is no more !
</p>
<p>Scene 5. Maxwell and wife in their new home; they are pros-
</p>
<p>perous again; Maxwell reading paper; poor and misgaidued man;
</p>
<p>he is gone; whence no traveler returned; another bit of news; the
</p>
<p>original conspirators all receive their doom; they are miserable for
</p>
<p>life; their fate is a solemn one; but mine is no better; Maxwell can

</p>
<p>Jakt Pritten  -Easily done I part! other boys were there; sev-

<p>en more boys were there; and it would be an easy matter to fleece
</p>
<p>them all; you I as an old detective should know; that the parent
</p>
<p>will pay up any amount, sooner than to have trouble and a law

</p>
<p>be able to continue this fine spree, upon the money of the victims,

<p>two or three dollars in total, and you have already received seven-

<p>matter with a full hand, and we must come out full-handed ! we

<p>shall; we must have the money ! by fair means, if possible ! by
</p>
<p>foul, if necessary; we shall make a compact; a plot, a conspiracj,

<p>them by the way; upon the information of Jaky, will arrest them
</p>
<p>in the dead of night, and we shall soon find more conspirators to
</p>
<p>assist us ! yes, boys ! will have it, ether the money or the boys;
</p>
<p>and if the parents refuse to shell out; they shall suffer ! be the powers !
</p>
<p>Wm. Hatwell  And who of the seven shall be our first victim?

<p>I say!
</p>
<p>Jaky & Pat  It shall be Myron Macholm I
</p>
<p>"Wm. Hatwell  And why him?
</p>
<p>Jaky  William! you are not wise; I wonder the authorities re-
</p>
<p>ll
</p>
<p>tain you as a detective, if 3^ou can not 8ee into a plot, better than
</p>
<p>you do; do you not remember, that young Eeynold and Kerans,
</p>
<p>took several tools from the shop; after breaking the windows,
</p>
<p>threw them into the canal; and afterward they took a reamer; a
</p>
<p>tool worth about two dollars; but which we may claim to be worth
</p>
<p>ten or fifteen dollars; we can do it as well as not; and we can with-
</p>
<p>out detection, claim that the damage sustained, has been more than
</p>
<p>seventeen dollars; which we have already received ?
</p>
<p>Wm, Hatwell  But if it came to an oath; Jacky ? how could
</p>
<p>you swear tc^those things ? you say j^ourself, that of the sixtj^-four
</p>
<p>panes of glass, you claim they had broken, thirty or forty had
</p>
<p>been broken long ago; previously to the boy's transaction; and
</p>
<p>your actual damage in factum and totalum; were but eighty or
</p>
<p>ninety cents? and
</p>
<p>Jaky  (Rising and getting angry)"-fooI ! idiot ! do you wish
</p>
<p>to betray our plans? and think jou; yourself, a model of human-
</p>
<p>ity? or do you fear to take part in the proceedings? I am con-
</p>
<p>vinced, that you never refuse to participate in our fun and pleas-
</p>
<p>ure; even the wine ! ha ! ha ! what say you now ?
</p>
<p>Wm. Hatwell  Nay! ISTay ! my friend; I am with you heart
</p>
<p>and soul; to detect is my business; and my pride, though, even it
</p>
<p>be a sham; you may depend on me in this matter- but our plan
</p>
<p>must be well laid so that a failure, shall be impossible.
</p>
<p>Pat  Yis, boys ! so I say ! we dedictives must be shrewd, and
</p>
<p>one failure may be our downfall; legally, if not morally, and we
</p>
<p>are ready to hear the plot
</p>
<p>Jaky  Here goes; fill up boys, and drink to success  (they all
</p>
<p>drink)  now for the plot and to-morrow for the execution; (all
</p>
<p>get close and listen) (Jaky proceeds :) we all know that the boy
</p>
<p>Myron took no part in the breaking of the windows; or the taking
</p>
<p>of the tools, but we must get the two boys that done the mischief
</p>
<p>to participate in our plot; which we can easily do; their fathers re-
</p>
<p>spectively keep a wine and liquor shop, and of course we all know
</p>
<p>them; well.

</p>
<p>William and Pat  You bet we do !
</p>
<p>Jaky  'We can make old Maxwell, (Myron's father) believe,
</p>
<p>that his boy broke at least thirty of the glasses or more; and then
</p>
<p>perhaps, he will come down with the stamps; our price in the
</p>
<p>transaction shall be three dollars and fifty cents, which would
</p>
<p>make it appear a fair allowance for damages sustained.
</p>
<p>Wm. Hatwell  But if he finds he has broken no glass at all ?
</p>
<p>what then ?
</p>
<p>Jaky  We must give him no time to find out the truth; besides,
</p>
<p>we tell him; the boy had stolen the reamer, (the tool which young
</p>
<p>Eeynold's had given him;) and which he has now in his posses-
</p>
<p>sion; a fact ! which he cannot deny; and even if he had not ta-
</p>
<p>ken it himself, he has it in his possession; which fact, alone would
</p>
<p>be "prima facia" evidence of stealing or receiving stolen goods;
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>easy enough done boys; I tell you, to prosecute him under such
</p>
<p>circumstances will be an easy matter; we will prove "petit lar-
</p>
<p>ceny," at any rate; but there will be no trouble; the old man Max-
</p>
<p>well will not let matters run thuskfar, that we must go to ex-
</p>
<p>tremes; I am thinking, he will shell out the stamps, and we shall
</p>
<p>be heeled for one night's spree at any rate; and if we should fail;
</p>
<p>the boy shall suffer; the father shall suffer; the whole family' shall
</p>
<p>suffer; we are bound to help ourselves I
</p>
<p>Altogether  Well planned, Jaky; give us your hand; you
</p>
<p>are a jolly companion  (Jaky)  to morrow eveniri^, we shall
</p>
<p>meet at the corner of Market and Jefferson streets, and press our
</p>
<p>demand all exit; curtain drops.

<p>Scene 2. The work-shop  (sign)  Maxwell Macholm, Cutter
</p>
<p>and tailor; (Maxwell, the Victim's fjather hard at work)
</p>
<p>Maxwell  Hard times indeed; work scarce and money scarcer:
</p>
<p>a person hardly sees his way ahead; customers have nd money;
</p>
<p>and  (rap at the door)  a-ha! customers! hojDe they are paying
</p>
<p>ones  (rap again)  (Maxwell runs to the door and opens it) 
</p>
<p>(enters, Jaky Written, Wm. Hatwell and Pat Hugit) Gentlemen !
</p>
<p>walk in; nice evening this ! nice evening ! what can I do for you,
</p>
<p>gentlemen? take your measure for a suit? (flourishes tape-line
</p>
<p>and pencil)  (Jaky to his companions)  the evening will not be
</p>
<p>so nice to him; and the measure will be for his greenbacks  (aloud
</p>
<p>to Maxwell.)
</p>
<p>Jaky  Mr. Macholm, we did not come to leave our measure
</p>
<p>this evening; but we have come
</p>
<p>Maxwell  No matter, gentlemen! no matter! 1 always like
</p>
<p>company; measure or no measure.
</p>
<p>Jaky Proceeds  We have come upon unpleasant business; un-
</p>
<p>pleasant to ourselves, and certainly, more so to you, sir !
</p>
<p>Maxwell  Unpleasant, gentlemen? unpleasant? what can be
</p>
<p>the matter , pray ?
</p>
<p>Jaky  We wish to see your son Myron, sir ! I suppose you
</p>
<p>know us; my name is Jacob Pritten, and these two gents here,

</p>
<p>my companions; are officers of the law.
</p>
<p>Maxwell  You wish to see Myron? what has he done to you,
</p>
<p>gentlemen? I have not heard of his having been wayward in
</p>
<p>any shape or manner; but I will call him; methinks he is but a
</p>
<p>short distance away from here  (exit Maxwell.)
</p>
<p>Jaky  I am nervous; he is a hard working man, and apparently
</p>
<p>honest; it is almost a pity  to deceive him  thus  but necessity
</p>
<p>knows no law !
</p>
<p>William  It is his pride and honesty, that will subdue him
</p>
<p>and make him come down; his good qualities are in our favor, and
</p>
<p>our advantage is easily gained 1
</p>
<p>Jaky  But I understand that he is one of those kind of men,
</p>
<p>tfcat he will first see; whether he is right and our demand just, and
</p>
<p>^hen he will go ahead; come what will !
</p>
<p>William  But that will help him nothing in this case.
</p>
<p>Jaky  Eight or wrong; our demands must be satisfied, or by
</p>
<p>the eternal, they shall suffer,
</p>
<p>(Enter  Maxwell Macholm with his son (Myron,) not yet thir-
</p>
<p>teen years old.)
</p>
<p>Maxwell  I have found him, gentlemen! and here he is  I
</p>
<p>liope your desire and business with him, will be stated in my
</p>
<p>presence ?
</p>
<p>Jaky and William  Certainly! it is no secret.
</p>
<p>Jaky  Myron! how many par.es of glass did you break
</p>
<p>on last Sunday; when you, in company with a lot of other boys,
</p>
<p>were playing about our factory?
</p>
<p>Myron None sir? I was merely looking on; when Eeynolds
</p>
<p>and Kerans done the mischief; and I took no part in their game,
</p>
<p>whatever !
</p>
<p>Jaky  I understand, and we can prove, that you broke some
</p>
<p>thirty or forty panes of glass.
</p>
<p>Myron  I deny it ! it is a falsehood.
</p>
<p>Jaky  Then you deny that you stole a reamer, also ?
</p>
<p>Myron  I do !
</p>
<p>Jaky  Have you not carried away a reamer, and which you
</p>
<p>have now in your possession?
</p>
<p>Myron  (After a pause;) if you mean a piece of iron with a
</p>
<p>knob on the end of it; and which we called a billy; the one given
</p>
<p>to me by John Eeynolds  I have it! when and where he got it;
</p>
<p>I know not, sir ! '
</p>
<p>Jaky  Where is it now?
</p>
<p>Myron  At home, upon a shelf; I will go and get it for you; if
</p>
<p>you wish ! but (getting his young blood up, and shaking his fist,)
</p>
<p>never dare to say; that I stole it !
</p>
<p>Maxwell And, gentlemen, do you accuse this boy with these
</p>
<p>charges; and can yoti prove them ?
</p>
<p>Jaky and William  We are sure he did it ! we are ready to

</p>
<p>Maxwell  Then gentlemen ! what is your purpose and desire ?
</p>
<p>Jaky  If you will pay the damage for breaking the glass, we
</p>
<p>will drop the matter.
</p>
<p>Maxwell  And how much shall be the price of the damage ?
</p>
<p>Jaky  Three dollars and fifty cents.
</p>
<p>Maxwell  G-entlemen, 1 will make inquiries truly and faithfully
</p>
<p>iuto this matter; if the boy be guilty; I will pay the amount, and if
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>not, I shall pro'oably not do so. Good evenings  (waves bis hand. )
</p>
<p>Jaky  To-morrow at noon we will call, and you better have the-
</p>
<p>money ready  (exit.)
</p>
<p>Maxwell  (To Myron)  " Boy,'"* tell me the truth I have yon
</p>
<p>done this mi&chief?
</p>
<p>Mybon  Father, I have told the truth !' I am not guiJty of either
</p>
<p>charge?
</p>
<p>Maxwell-  T wxll see the boys, and hear their own statement.
</p>
<p>(Waves his hand to the boy)  (boy exit.)
</p>
<p>Maxwell  The boy is innocent, I can see it plainly; but T will
</p>
<p>gather further proof; I shall get it, and I hope that the boy's in-
</p>
<p>nocence will be established; (starts for the door;) curtain drops.

</p>
<p>Jakt (Defiantly;) well sir; have you got the money? can you:
</p>
<p>comply with our dem^and?'
</p>
<p>Maxwell  Gentlemen? by all information I can gather from
</p>
<p>parties present on the day you mention; I find that my son My-
</p>
<p>ron; in fact, has broken no windows, and that he had not beetii
</p>
<p>nearer to the shop than several rods; gentlemen, your demand is
</p>
<p>unjust ! but the amount you ask, being trifling, and yet, consid-
</p>
<p>ering the dullness of the times; work is scarce and poorly paid, and
</p>
<p>my large family at home, and money comes in very slowly; it
</p>
<p>ji hard on me these times; but, yet, if you will reduce the amoun,t,
</p>
<p>I would rather let my family suffer for one day or two; and I am
</p>
<p>eut^e, they will not grumble say two dollars, gentlemen  two dol-
</p>
<p>}ar&, and call to-morrow; this time about; and the amount shall be
</p>
<p>placed in your hands  1 beg of you humbly; (bowing politely,)
</p>
<p>Jaky  No sir ! three fifty is our demand; and that at once; we
</p>
<p>shall not wait ten minutes, or you shall suffer!
</p>
<p>Maxwell (Emphatically;) then by the eternal f suffer I will;
</p>
<p>sooner than to satisfy your unjust demand, and your insolence to
</p>
<p>me  "nay," your defiance shall not scare me! and if you were

<p>(stand up and hold up your hands.)
</p>
<p>First Witness Jacob Pritten  I am joint owner of a man-
</p>
<p>ufactory; on the 12th of March last, sixty -four panes of glass were
</p>
<p>broken out of our factory, to the value and damage of twenty-five
</p>
<p>dollars; I was informed that two boys had broken them; their
</p>
<p>names are John Eeynolds and John Kerans; I went there and
</p>
<p>they acknowledged the mischief, and their fathers respectively,
</p>
<p>paid to me the sum of eight dollars and fifty cents, making sev-
</p>
<p>enteen dollars; being two-thirds of the damage sustained; at the same
</p>
<p>time, they told us that Myron Macholm, was the other, or third
</p>
<p>party, that stole the reamer; we went there, to Maxwell Macholm's,
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>t^e*boy'&, '(Myron's) fatlier, and confronted Myron, but be denied
</p>
<p>^all knowledge of having seen said reamer, but afterwards, when
</p>
<p>we pressed him, and when we returned, we found the tool in bis
</p>
<p>possession 1 and I, then bad him arrested. (Cross examined by
</p>
<p>defendant's counsel.)
</p>
<p>Lawyer Dravens  And what was your demand for money for?
</p>
<p>Jaky Pritten  I made no demand for money !
</p>
<p>Lawyer Bravens  Did you not demand three dollars and
</p>
<p>one-half? (Jaky Pritten G-etting red in the face and ashamed.)
</p>
<p>Jaky  I. did not ask for money !
</p>
<p>Lawyer Dravens  You deny it then ? it is all we want !
</p>
<p>William Hatwell  I am an officer of the law; went with Mr.
</p>
<p>Pritten to get the reamer from Myron Macholm; he denied hav-
</p>
<p>ing the same; but we found it aftei-wards in his possession; I ar-
</p>
<p>rested him subsequently. (Cross examined.)
</p>
<p>Lawyer Dravens  What was your motive for calling a second
</p>
<p>time; several days after? (Wm. Hatwell gets red and perspires.)
</p>
<p>Hatwell  We did not call a second time.
</p>
<p>Lawyer Dravens  Then you deny; also; that you went to
</p>
<p>(Mr. Macholm's) in company with Mr. Pritten, and demanded
</p>
<p>from Mr. Macholm the sum of three dollars and fifty cents; wbat
</p>
<p>was that for ?
</p>
<p>Wm. Hatwell I deny it, we were not there.
</p>
<p>Lawyer, Dravens  That will do sir! I call Mr. Maxwell
</p>
<p>Macholm !
</p>
<p>Maxwell Macholm On or about the 25th day of March; Jacob
</p>
<p>Pritten and Wm. Hatwell and another, came to my shop and
</p>
<p>asked for Myron; I called him, and they accused him with the
</p>
<p>breaking of forty or fifty panes of glass at the factory of Mr.
</p>

<p>sitting some eight or ten rods away from the factory; Myron was

<p>John Kerans  I was one of the boys that broke the windows;

<p>John Eeynolds  I and Kerans, broke the windows, and I took

<p>the tool.
</p>
<p>Prosecuting Attorney  Who told you to take it?
</p>
<p>John Eeynolds It was Myron Macholm.
</p>
<p>Myron Macholm  I broke no windo^vs; neither did I take the
</p>
<p>tool; neither did I tell John Eeynolds to take it; it is a falsehood,
</p>
<p>and a big lie I I was not near the shop, and Eeynolds bronghtlhe

<p>tool to me; and he said : Myron, do you want a billy ? I said : yes,

<p>I will take it, and put it in my pocket; that is all I know about;

<p>it. (Testimony rests.)
</p>
<p>Argument of Prosecutor  James Spbague, Esq.  Gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury: 1 will not detain you long in what I have to
</p>
<p>say in opening the case. The State has proven, I think, beyond
</p>
<p>a doubt, that the reamer, charged to have been stolen, was taken
</p>
<p>from the factory without the consent of the owners  its value has
</p>
<p>been proven to be ten dollars. Now the only question foryonito
</p>
<p>determine, is; is the defendant guilty, as charged? We think,
</p>
<p>there can be no doubt of this; from the fact, that the law presumes,
</p>
<p>where goods recently stolen are traced to the possession of one;
</p>
<p>not the owner, who can give no reasonable account of the manmer
</p>
<p>in which he came into the possession of them; or gives contradic-
</p>
<p>tory and conflicting statements concerning the manner of getting
</p>
<p>possession, is presumed by law to be the thief. This view of the
</p>
<p>case I take, and therefore think, I am but doing my duty, to ask
</p>
<p>a verdict of guilty at your hands. I will now leave the case, matil
</p>
<p>I hear from the counsel for the defendant.

</p>
<p>Defendant  Gentlemen of the Jury : In making my argument
</p>
<p>for the defendant in this case, in defending him against that,
</p>
<p>which I regard as a foul conspiracy, 1 shall make no claim; except,
</p>
<p>that which I feel perfectly warranted in making, by the testimosy
</p>
<p>of the witnesses, and shall confine myself to their statemesits made
</p>
<p>under oath. You, gentlemen of the jury, have heard and atten-
</p>
<p>tively listened to all their statements; and you can not fail to re-
</p>
<p>member that all the witnesses, save one; and (that one, the
</p>
<p>self-acknowledged thief;) have sworn that the defendant, did not
</p>
<p>only, not steal the article charged to have been stolen, b^t was in
</p>
<p>no position to abet the theft. It is shown that his character i
</p>
<p>good; that he has never before been charged with any offence;
</p>
<p>although he did have possession of the reamer after the theft waa
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>committed, there is not a single syllable of tesimony, that at the
</p>
<p>time he received, or ever knew before this arrest was brought,
</p>
<p>that it had been stolen; save and except, the testimony of the boy
</p>
<p>who did steal it, and that testimony is not only unsupported by
</p>
<p>ALL the other witnesses who were there, but is flatly contradicted.
</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, can you on your oaths as jurors, with this plain
</p>
<p>and unvarnished statement of facts before you, this powerful array
</p>
<p>of witnesses, convict this poor boy of an offence of which he is as
</p>
<p>innocent as you are,  can you cover him with an infamy which
</p>
<p>will cling to him for all time to come, while the one who ac-
</p>
<p>knowledges himself the thief, goes unwhipt of justice. Think of
</p>
<p>your own boy, if you have one, being the victim of so foul a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and say by your verdict  go hence. We do not ask a ver-
</p>
<p>dict of not guilty through any sympathy we might excite in your
</p>
<p>minds, but upon the broad principle of human justice which will
</p>
<p>not permit even the humblest of God's creatures to suffer for the
</p>
<p>crime of another. Gentlemen, I thank you for your attention, and
</p>
<p>leave the case in your hands, fully believing that you will acquit
</p>
<p>the defendant and send him forth without a single stain on his
</p>
<p>hitherto unblemished character.
</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Last Argument.  Gentlemen of the Jury : I do
</p>
<p>not care to occupy much of your time in this the closing argument
</p>
<p>of this case. 1 believe upon a consideration of all the facts, and
</p>
<p>under the charge which shall be given you by the court, you will
</p>
<p>be warranted in rendering a verdict of guilty, and that speedily.
</p>
<p>It is true as stated by counsel, that a cloud of witnesses have
</p>
<p>sworn that the defendant did not steal the article charged to have
</p>
<p>been stolen, but thus I take it: you will consider for the most part
</p>
<p>in the character of negative testimony, when you consider the
</p>
<p>fact that one of the witnesses swears that the defendant pointed
</p>
<p>the article out to him and told him to take it; why, these little
</p>
<p>rascals will swear to anything, and you are not bound to believe
</p>
<p>anything they say. The idea that this boy is not guilty, is ridic-
</p>
<p>ulous. You are here to defend the community against just such

</p>
<p>depredations as this. You are hero to say, that rogues of all ages
</p>
<p>shall be punished; and the fact, that a defendant happens to be a
</p>
<p>young boy, as in this case, you must not take into account. It has
</p>
<p>been shown that he did receive the goods stolen, and you must
</p>
<p>say if that is not as bad as the stealing itself. There is no law to
</p>
<p>punish him as the receiver where the amount is less than thirty -five
</p>
<p>dollars, unless you find him guilty as the thief. With this, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, I leave the case in your hands, feeling that I may well do
</p>
<p>so under the charge of the court, and feeling no apprehensions as
</p>
<p>to what your verdict will be.
</p>
<p>Charge op Judge DeWiley.  Gentlemen of the Jury : You
</p>
<p>will find if you can, from the evidence, whether the defendant stole
</p>
<p>the article charged in the information; it is not necessary that he
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>should take it from the place where it lay, in order that you may
</p>
<p>find him guilty, but if it was done by his directions, he is still
</p>
<p>jufiiilty; for the law says that an aider and abettor shall be pun-
</p>
<p>ished as the principal offender. In this case you have the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of the boy Reynolds who says that the defendant told him
</p>
<p>to take the reamer; if you find that to be true, you will return a
</p>
<p>verdict of guilty; if you find that the defendant received and con-
</p>
<p>cealed the reamer after it was stolen, knowing it to have been
</p>
<p>stolen, he is also guilty of the larceny as charged in the informa-
</p>
<p>ation; if you find that the defendant has given contradictory state-
</p>
<p>ments as to how he came into possession of the property, it will
</p>
<p>be considered as far as it goes, as evidence of guilt. You will
</p>
<p>therefore take all the testimony and weigh, it carefully and bring
</p>
<p>in your verdict accordingly. You will now retire. (The jury
</p>
<p>render a verdict without leaving the box.)

<p>Myron  (In surprise)  sentence! I thought that my time in
</p>
<p>jail  almost two weeks was sentence enough for any body, that
</p>
<p>has done nothing in the world, to offend neither Grod nor the law;
</p>
<p>I was in hopes that I was discharged, and my freedom given me !
</p>
<p>Judge  That is where you are mistaken ! your imprisonment
</p>
<p>will just begin,  believing that you are the wickedest boy in the
</p>
<p>State, I now sentence you to the Institution, called the Eeform

<p>brought before a higher court. Judge Bllicott becomes interested;
</p>
<p>he believes in his heart, that the judge below is a conspirator, and
</p>
<p>tells him to discharge the boy.
</p>
<p>Enter  Judge Ellicott  Judge DeWiley I this case of Myron
</p>
<p>Macholm has been brought before me upon a writ of habses corpus,
</p>
<p>and after mature deliberation, and considering all the facts in the
</p>
<p>case, and being as I believe, powerless to discharge the boy, for
</p>
<p>want of jurisdiction, I have concluded to say to you, however, in
</p>
<p>justice to all parties, that you had better discharge the boy; he is
</p>
<p>neither a criminal nor a vicious boy, and has been already in jail
</p>
<p>two weeks, which is punishment enough for any boy, under the
</p>
<p>slender evidence upon which he was convicted.
</p>
<p>Judge DbWilet  I will fake your advice, judge, and act ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly  send the boy to me and I will release him; (exit Judsre
</p>

<p>Judge DeWiley  Myron, I will discharge you for the present;

<p>be discharged, and thereby, we have lost all our chances of satis-

<p>faction ! we were still in hopes that old Maxwell would have to
</p>
<p>pay'
</p>
<p>Judge  Why, gentlemen, it was no use, the old man would not
</p>
<p>come down with the stamps, and Judge Ellicott, not only advised
</p>
<p>me to discharge the boy, but his advice, almost amounted to a
</p>
<p>mandate; he seems to have taken an interest in the case, and
</p>
<p>Jaky  But you were not obliged to discharge him ?
</p>
<p>Judge  Kot altogether; but I thought it best to let him go at
</p>
<p>present.
</p>
<p>Wm. Hatwell  But you can have him re-arrested again ?
</p>
<p>Judge  I can upon good grounds ?
</p>
<p>Jaky  But look here  (forcing the judge to take a full glass

<p>more of whisky in order to get bis spirits up)  take this judge

<p>and I will come to business  (judge drinks)  now judge; here is

<p>ing for Myron to appear)  "I have been watching and waiting here,

<p>for nearly an hour, and yet, I have not seen Myron; I hope he will
</p>
<p>soon come; it is almost too bad to re-arrest the poor, simple boy,

<p>Lawyer  The Governor! he would be the last hope, indeed !
</p>
<p>but I think he will pardon the boy, if the full statement of facts
</p>
<p>are presented to him properly,  Mr. Howe, my colleague, has

<p>spoken to me this morning; he has heard of your case and he
</p>
<p>takes much interest in your behalf.
</p>
<p>Maxwell  I will see Mr. Howe  I know him well, and we are
</p>
<p>not strangers; but I did not know he befriended me?

<p>Lawyer Dravens  But he knows you and your wife; also the

<p>boy Myron, and he speaks well of the boy  his indorsement to

<p>the Governor will do you much good  I will see him, and his

<p>mary vengeance upon his enemies? stain his hands with blood,
</p>
<p>and add crime to misfortune he is mad, I know; he knows not
</p>
<p>what he is doioij; and I fear the worst  if I could only see him 
</p>
<p>even at the peril of leaving the house  1 may deter him from his
</p>
<p>fearful plan  it is stormy without and 1 am not strong enough
</p>
<p>to go far  (gets up and totters to the door unable to walk  clock

<p>strikes ten  peals of thunder  vivid flashes of lightning;) I can not
</p>
<p>face the fury of this storm, it would be my death  but yet, where;
</p>
<p>or where is my husband? Maxwell, Maxwell, where are you ? I
</p>
<p>beseech you to desist from your fearful plan  (falls on her knees

</p>
<p>his contemplated design, and give strength to his demented brain
</p>

</p>
<p>stranger in conversation; no li^ht; but Maxwell holds a dim light-

<p>my hatred foe, the tyrant ! the murderer! (pause!) the plot will

<p>made out and delivered to me before twelve o'clock to-mght; tell
</p>
<p>him that I await him at his office at " eleven;" it will do; tell him
</p>
<p>my business is very urgent, and hence, my untimely request; ten
</p>
<p>dollars will be a fair recompense for his trouble; he will be there,

<p>work (thunder and lightning)  I feel chilly ! [drawing his cloak

<p>close around him]  but, it is the result of the storm without; not

<p>more furious than the storm within ray bosom ! I am already

<p>elements do not discourage nor scare me ! T thank God, my nerves

<p>are steeled for this fearful hour of retribution; [wiping brow;]
</p>
<p>great drops of sweat pour down and drop off ray brow, but not

<p>80 large as the drops of my bleeding heart within ! and my poor
</p>
<p>wife at home, how often her heart must bleed, and yet she is pa-

<p>tient, and even asks me to forgive and forget! (pause) how can I?
</p>
<p>does she not yet know Maxwell Macholm? patient and humble !
</p>
<p>but he has a heart! no, Maxwell! no outrage so cruel and hard
</p>
<p>hearted shall go unpunished, though, I, myself, became the martyr
</p>
<p>ot a fearful doom ! [drops voice !] she knows not this moment
</p>
<p>where I am, and what my fearful plans may be? (pause?) but my
</p>
<p>time is short, it is no tirae for idle thoughts ! [looks at his watch !]
</p>
<p>it is nearly thirty minutes within the appointed time, and my job
</p>
<p>is nearly done  [shovels]  ay! ay! I see now the casket which

<p>Scene 5. The half-way rest in the forest; the meeting at the
</p>
<p>old chesnut tree; a trusty friend and a friend indeed  Maxwell
</p>
<p>[walking with coffin;] [stops for a rest;] (sits down on an old
</p>
<p>stump in the forest.)
</p>
<p>Maxwell  One half of my journey with this precious treasure
</p>
<p>is accomplished  it is getting heavy; (pause;) though my time be
</p>
<p>short, I must take a rest; (pause;) did I say, this load was heavy?
</p>
<p>nay ! nay ! gracious Grod ! it is the load that rests upon my bleed-
</p>
<p>ing heart  that is heavy ! I imagine that I could travel hundreds
</p>
<p>of miles with this load; if the treasure within, could open its eyes
</p>
<p>and the boy could be restored to me, (pause,) but it is impossi-
</p>
<p>ble, the dead never return ! no ! never ! ! never ! ! ! [sobs aloud I ]
</p>
<p>34-
</p>
<p>(pause I) [the shriek of the kokoo is heard at a distance three
</p>
<p>times,] (Maxwell starts,) "hark! it is the kokoo ! thank God, it.
</p>
<p>is a good omen ! " thrice the kokoo shrieks, and the old sooth-
</p>
<p>sayers claim it means the fulfillment of our nearest and dearest
</p>
<p>wishes; if so, I may be assured that my mission shall succeed I
</p>
<p>(pause !) but methinks, do I see aright? [points near him,] yonder
</p>
<p>stands the old chesnut tree t it is here my friendly ally promised
</p>
<p>to meet me ! and it is but a short space I yes f but a few steps yet,
</p>
<p>to the last scene of this fearful drama? I know my faithful Han-
</p>
<p>son will not desert me, he is a friend indeed, and friends are few
</p>
<p>and far between; do I not prize a friend as the dearest gift on
</p>
<p>earth that God can bestow; it is not in my nature to be otherwise ?
</p>
<p>how could it be otherwise? have I not an hundred enemies to one
</p>
<p>friend? have they not brought me and my family to all miseries
</p>
<p>worse than death ? (overcome  pause,) but no ! 1 am wrong ! God
</p>
<p>forgive me for what I say! no! no! noble men are still in the
</p>
<p>land, though they be counted in the scale of minority ! yefe I they
</p>
<p>should be balanced upon the scale of equality with the precious
</p>
<p>diamond  have not many noble men come to my rescue? where
</p>
<p>is Mr. HoWe, my benefactor  where is our merciful Governor?
</p>
<p>and many others, did they not shine forth in the eleventh hour of
</p>
<p>my misfortune, like the beautiful evening star at midnight? yes !
</p>
<p>I say, God save the few noble men that are still left in this
</p>
<p>broad land; (pause;) but my time is getting short  Hanson must
</p>
<p>be near at hand  " hark f" he is coming; I knew my friend would
</p>
<p>not desert me in this trying hour, and I hope his mission has
</p>
<p>been fruitful.
</p>
<p>Hanson Appears  He is here ! Hanson ! thy trusty friend,
</p>
<p>and his mission has been a success  [whispers]  he will be there
</p>
<p>by this time  hasten thither, and thy sworn enemy will meet
</p>
<p>you ! (they shake a hearty hand.)

<p>Maxwell  Many thanks, my good friend ! how can I ever re-
</p>
<p>pay you? (takes casket on his shoulder ! ) I go trusted servant,

</p>
<p>Hanson  He will ! he will protect Ihee and thy just cause 
</p>
<p>[Maxwell goes]  (long pause)  [Hanson looking after him] 
</p>
<p>poor man, his lot is a hard one; and this last step is one
</p>
<p>from which the most stoutest man would shrink  but his cause is
</p>
<p>just, and he is a noble man, indeed  I will follow and assist him 
</p>
<p>all that mortal man can do ! ever I in a moment of my direst need
</p>
<p>he has assisted me; not myself only  but hundreds of others,
</p>
<p>without regard to grade or condition  and have not the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors persecuted him like a dog? I have watched all, and no more
</p>
<p>ill used man than he, is to be found in this broad land ! I will not
</p>
<p>desert him in this awful moment I will follow and protect him,
</p>
<p>even at the peril of my own own life!  (goes.)

<p>ACT VI.
</p>
<p>Scene 1. Arrival of Maxwell with the casket at the court
</p>
<p>house  (enter disguised with heavy false whiskers)  [sits casket
</p>
<p>down behind the door]  (locks and bolts door.)
</p>
<p>Maxwell  I am here in good time ! with the evidence of his
</p>
<p>guilt in my hands! I shall not be detained long! for at the spirit
</p>
<p>hour the child commands me to avenge its murder ! a ha ! [listens
</p>
<p>to noise in corridor!] I hear ! he comes I (side door opens and

<p>judge enters.)

<p>Judge DeWiley Enters  (Sits down and sees not his visitor 
</p>
<p>takes papers out of his pocket and reads to himf^elf.)
</p>
<p>Maxwell (Locks and bolts door and puts key in his pocket) 
</p>
<p>[hisses]  it is he! and he never shall leave this threshold !! 
</p>
<p>(pause)  methinks that I could not bear to face his cursed coun-
</p>
<p>tenance! and nay very vitals seem to turn to behold his polluted
</p>
<p>form; what hinders me from sending his wicked soul into eternity;
</p>
<p>[draws dagger;) yes! into hell! vs^ithout a moment's warning ! 
</p>
<p>(long pause)  but, no ! Maxwell shall not bear the stain of a cow-
</p>
<p>ardly assassin ! face to face he shall receive his death blow ! and
</p>
<p>he shall have ample time to ask forgiveness of his Maker ! yes !
</p>
<p>even in this, my hour of sweet triumph, Maxwell shall ever re-
</p>
<p>main generous and true  [returns dagger to bosom]  (^and listens
</p>
<p>to the judge.)
</p>
<p>Judge DeWileyI hope this stranger will not detain me long !
</p>
<p>it is a queer request ! I may be foolish to obey and at the dead' of
</p>
<p>night !  [he shudders audibly]  (gets nervous)  it may be the re-
</p>
<p>quest of a lunatic? but he tells me his case is urgent and he sends
</p>
<p>me ten dollars, which by the way, pays me right well  he will not
</p>
<p>stay long I hope !
</p>
<p>Maxwell  (Forward;) (in cloak and slouched hat and big false
</p>
<p>beard)  nay ! nay ! ! my lord ! I shall not stay long, my appoint-
</p>
<p>ments are always held dear; right glad am I that thou hast fulfilled
</p>
<p>them and granted my request ! (looks him in the eye )

<p>Judge  (To himself and nervous)  methinks I know this voice !
</p>
<p>Maxwell  (Sits down)  it is almost midnight and we will
</p>
<p>come to business at once !
</p>
<p>Judge  (To himself)  he dictates!
</p>
<p>Maxwell [Takes papers out out of bis pocket]  " I want
</p>
<p>you to probate to me this deed which I hold here !  [shows an en-
</p>
<p>velope on one side] but first, come close and listen while I make
</p>
<p>a formal explanation"  [they sit close and judge listens]  (Max-
</p>
<p>well proceeds),  " it is but a few years since that some property
</p>
<p>came into our possession, to my wife and myself  we were the
</p>
<p>joint owners and our title was indisputable,  we thought much
</p>
<p>of that property, and we thought it more valuable than life itself!
</p>
<p>36-
</p>
<p>but in an evil hour some vile scoundrels have dared to conspire
</p>
<p>to rob me of a trifling sum of monej. and when I did refuse, be-
</p>
<p>cause, knowing the injustice of their demand; (pause;) ail ! all ! !
</p>
<p>was lost ! ! ! "
</p>
<p>Judge  [getting restless] (to himself)  (what does this mean ?)
</p>
<p>and how
</p>
<p>Maxwell  Much does it mean!  pardon me for my inter-
</p>
<p>ruption ! 1 did refuse, did I say? yes ! ye ! ! correct ! ! ! when I bad
</p>
<p>refused, their wi^ath was fearful, and they swore they would have
</p>
<p>satisfaction  (pause.)
</p>
<p>Judge  And what did they do ?
</p>
<p>Maxwell  They caused to be taken, and seized the property
</p>
<p>above mentioned, before our very eyes, and without a moment's
</p>
<p>warning  a property which we both held so dear !  (pause.)
</p>
<p>Judge  [proceed ! proceed ! )
</p>
<p>Maxwell  Patience ! patience ! ! soon enough shall *l reveal
</p>
<p>and recall to you the foul plot, but that was not all; it was but a
</p>
<p>short time thereafter, when the Lord in hi-^ goodness saw fit to
</p>
<p>grant to us, to my wife and myself another share of this world's
</p>
<p>happiness, (pause,) but my wife, frail creature, that she was, and
</p>
<p>by the fell blow of the robbers' hand, she fell sick and lay, as it
</p>
<p>were, in the scale of uncertainty  between life and death  and
</p>
<p>the property bequeathed to us was naught ! a dead blank !
</p>
<p>Judge  [Getting uneasy]  but what has this to do with me? I
</p>
<p>do not comprehend ?
</p>
<p>Maxwell  Your interest is at stake ! as you shall comprehend
</p>
<p>shortly ! listen ! I have sworn to punish the evil doers, and to re-
</p>
<p>deem my oath, and so regain at least, part of the lost chattels by
</p>
<p>fair means, or by foul !

<p>her moments of anguish did ask thee to restore the boy to her '

<p>point of death and but a slight shadow intervened between her life

</p>
<p>could not release himself.
</p>
<p>James Drink! is it I never! Judge DeWiley never drinks; he

<p>must be sick, or overworked; poor man, he has much upon his

<p>Denis  And look at the blood; holy Moses; sure, he is killed in-

<p>tirely, so he is! let us take him to his home I (they bear him on

<p>fire! you wish to burn me?  (draws back)  already do I see the

<p>Scene 4. Judge DeWiley hopelessly insane, and m the last
</p>
<p>stage of consumption; he is fettered with ball and chain  a group
</p>
<p>stands before his cell the trio of conspirators Pritten  -Hatwell,
</p>
<p>and Hugit are the distinguished visitors  (Hatwell on crutches;
</p>
<p>two legs oft from the knee down  crippled for life.)

<p>your old friends ?

<p>frightened me so; the one that made the fire in that fearful eaul-

<p>dron ? that I should be burnt up by the tames ?  (pause)  a fear-

<p>ful fire rages within me now and lightning flashes across my dim
</p>
<p>vision, and then again I see an apparition  a figure; yes, two fig-

<p>ures; a thousand figures! they come forth and frighten me! 
</p>
<p>(pau8e)then again, I feel the fierce blast of an arctic wave from
</p>
<p>northern oceans ! it creeps ! it creeps up to me, like the iceberg
</p>
<p>creeps up to a distressed ship in the dreary mid winter night, it
</p>
<p>comes nearer and nearer, and it curdles the very blood in my
</p>
<p>veins ! it crushes the frail craft to a thousand splinters, though it
</p>
<p>were an eggshell in the hands of a giant monster; then again, I
</p>
<p>see the fire and a thousand figures; angels and devils combined,
</p>
<p>all joined in a fantastic manner, each striving to beat the other in
</p>
<p>tantalizing my poor frame !  (cries and sobs.)
</p>
<p>Pritten  To his companions  come ! let us go, I can not stand

<p>this any longer; we have sinned hard m trjang to crush old

<p>Maxwell; we have deluded this poor victim and drawn him into

<p>a net from which he can never escape; he was drawn into it by
</p>
<p>our own hands like the fisherman upon the shore draws the in-
</p>
<p>habitants of the deep into his own ! we are his destroyer, and
</p>
<p>Maxwell Macholm, the noble man, that he is, he is avenged, his

<p>triumph is complete, and I fear his triumph will end with our de-
