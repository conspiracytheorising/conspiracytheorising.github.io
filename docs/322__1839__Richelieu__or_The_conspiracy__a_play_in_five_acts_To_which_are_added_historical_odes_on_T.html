<p>PREFACE TO RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>THE administration of Cardinal Richelieu, whom
</p>
<p>(despite all his darker qualities) Voltaire and
</p>
<p>History justly consider the true architect of the
</p>
<p>French monarchy, and the great parent of French
</p>
<p>civilization, is characterised by features alike
</p>
<p>tragic and comic. A weak king an ambitious
</p>
<p>favourite; a despicable conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>minister, nearly always associated with a danger-
</p>
<p>ous treason against the State These, with little
</p>
<p>variety of names and dates, constitute the eventful
</p>
<p>cycle through which, with a dazzling ease, and an
</p>
<p>arrogant confidence, the great luminary fulfilled
</p>
<p>its destinies. Blent together, in startling contrast,
</p>
<p>we see the grandest achievements and the pettiest
</p>
<p>agents ; the spy the mistress the capuchin ;
</p>
<p>the destruction of feudalism ; the humiliation of
</p>
<p>Austria ; the dismemberment of Spain.

</p>
<p>Richelieu himself is still what he was in his
</p>
<p>v jji PREFACE.
</p>
<p>own day a man of two characters. It', on the
</p>
<p>one hand, he is justly represented as inflexible
</p>
<p>and vindictive, crafty and unscrupulous ; so, on
</p>
<p>the other, it cannot be denied that he was placed
</p>
<p>in times in which the long impunity of every
</p>
<p>license required stern examples that he was
</p>
<p>beset by perils and intrigues, which gave a certain
</p>
<p>excuse to the subtlest inventions of self-defence
</p>
<p>that his ambition was inseparably connected with
</p>
<p>a passionate love for the glory of his country
</p>
<p>and that, if he was her dictator, he was not less
</p>
<p>her benefactor. It has been fairly remarked, by
</p>
<p>the most impartial historians, that he was no less
</p>
<p>generous to merit than severe to crime that, in
</p>
<p>the various departments of the State, the Army,
</p>
<p>and the Church, he selected and distinguished the
</p>
<p>ablest aspirants that the wars which he con-
</p>
<p>ducted were, for the most part, essential to the
</p>
<p>preservation of France, and Europe itself, from
</p>
<p>the formidable encroachments of the Austrian
</p>
<p>House that, in spite of those wars, the people
</p>
<p>were not oppressed with exorbitant imposts
</p>
<p>and that he left the kingdom he had governed
</p>
<p>in a more flourishing and vigorous state than at
</p>
<p>any former period of the French history, or at the

</p>
<p>decease of Louis XIV.
</p>
<p>PREFACE. i x
</p>
<p>The cabals formed against .this great statesman
</p>
<p>were not carried on by the patriotism of public
</p>
<p>virtue, or the emulation of equal talent : they were
</p>
<p>but court struggles, in which the most worthless
</p>
<p>agents had recourse to the most desperate means.
</p>
<p>In each, as I have before observed, we see com-
</p>
<p>bined the twofold attempt to murder the minister
</p>
<p>and to betray the country. Such, then, are the
</p>
<p>agents, and such the designs, with which truth, in
</p>
<p>the Drama as in History, requires us to contrast the
</p>
<p>celebrated Cardinal ; not disguising his foibles or
</p>
<p>his vices, but not unjust to the grander qualities
</p>
<p>(especially the love of country), by which they
</p>
<p>were often dignified, and, at times, redeemed.
</p>
<p>The historical drama is the concentration of
</p>
<p>historical events. In the attempt to place upon
</p>
<p>the stage the picture of an era, that license with
</p>
<p>dates and details, which Poetry permits, and which
</p>
<p>the highest authorities in the Drama of France
</p>
<p>herself, have sanctioned, has been, though not un-
</p>
<p>sparingly, indulged. The conspiracy of the Due
</p>
<p>de Bouillon is, for instance, amalgamated with the
</p>
<p>denouement of The Day of Dupes ;* and circum-
</p>
<p>* Le Cardinal se croit perdu, et prepare sa retraite. Ses amis lui
</p>
<p>conseillent de tenter enfin aupres du roi un nouvel effort. Le

</p>

<p>stances connected with the treason of Cinq Mars
</p>
<p>(whose brilliant youth and gloomy catastrophe
</p>
<p>tend to subvert poetic and historic justice, by se-
</p>
<p>ducing us to forget his base ingratitude and his
</p>
<p>perfidious apostacy) are identified with the fate of
</p>
<p>the earlier favourite Baradas,* whose sudden rise
</p>
<p>and as sudden fall passed into a proverb. I ought
</p>
<p>to add, that the noble romance of Cinq Mars sug-
</p>
<p>gested one of the scenes in the fifth act ; and that
</p>
<p>for the conception of some portion of the intrigue
</p>
<p>connected with De Mauprat and Julie, I am, with
</p>
<p>great alterations of incident, and considerable if
</p>
<p>not entire reconstruction of character, indebted
</p>
<p>to an early and admirable novel by the author of
</p>
<p>Picciola.^

<p>London, March, 1839.

<p>some of the impressions which the eloquence of both the writers I

<p>principal of which are specified (as they occur) in marginal notes. Many of

<p>be such as the reader would be least inclined to dispense with viz., those which,

</p>
<p>OR,
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ACT I.
</p>
<p>SCENE I.
</p>
<p>A room in the house of Marion de Lorme ; a table towards
</p>
<p>the front of the stage (with wine, fruits, 8fc.),at which are
</p>
<p>seated Baradas, Four Courtiers, splendidly dressed in the
</p>
<p>costume of 1641-2; the Duke of Orleans reclining on a
</p>
<p>large fauteuil ; Marion de Lorme, standing at the back of
</p>
<p>his chair, offers him a goblet, and then retires. At another
</p>
<p>table , De Beringhen, De Mauprat, jjlaying at dice ; other
</p>
<p>Courtiers, of inferior rank to those at the table of the Duke,
</p>
<p>looking on.
</p>
<p>ORLEANS (drinking}.
</p>
<p>HERE'S to our enterprise !
</p>
<p>BARADAS (glancing at Marion).
</p>
<p>Hush, Sir !-
</p>
<p>ORLEANS (aside).
</p>
<p>Nay, Count,
</p>
<p>You may trust her ; she doats on me ; no house
</p>
<p>So safe as Marion's.* At our statelier homes
</p>
<p>The very walls do play the eaves-dropper.
</p>
<p>There's not a sunheam creeping o'er our floors
</p>
<p>But seems a glance from that malignant eye
</p>
<p>Which reigns o'er France; our fatal greatness lives
</p>
<p>In the sharp glare of one relentless day.
</p>
<p>But Richelieu's self forgets to fear the sword
</p>
<p>The myrtle hides; and Marion's silken robe 10
</p>
<p>Casts its kind charity o'er fiercer sins
</p>
<p>Than those which haunt the rosy path between

<p>Bouillon will join his army with the Spaniard,

<p>You will be Regent ; I, and ye, my Lords,

<p>We must destroy the Argus : ay, my Lords,

<p>It was so, Sir.
</p>
<p>Note the distinction : I weigh'd well the cause
</p>
<p>Which made the standard holy ; raised the war
</p>
<p>But to secure the peace. France bled I groan'd ; 350
</p>
<p>But look'd beyond ; and, in the vista, saw
</p>
<p>France saved, and I exulted. You but you

<p>Were but the tool of slaughter knowing nought,

<p>* Richelieu did in fact so thoroughly associate himself with the State, that,
</p>
<p>in cases where the extreme penalty of the law had been incurred, Le Clerc
</p>
<p>justly observes that he was more inexorable to those he had favoured even to
</p>
<p>his own connections than to other and more indifferent offenders. It must be
</p>
<p>remembered as some excuse for his unrelenting sternness that, before his time,
</p>
<p>the great had been accustomed to commit any disorder with impunity even the
</p>
<p>crime of treason, ' auparavant on ne faisoit . poser les arines aux rebelles qu'en
</p>
<p>leur accordant quelque recompense." On entering into the administration, he
</p>
<p>therefore laid it down as a maxim necessary to the existence of the State, that
</p>
<p>" no crime should be committed with impunity." To carry out this maxim,
</p>
<p>the long-established licence to crime made even justice seem cruel. But the
</p>
<p>victims most commiserated from their birth or accomplishments, as Montmorenci,
</p>
<p>or Cinq Mats, were traitors in actual conspiracy against their country, and
</p>
<p>would have forfeited life in any land where the punishmynt of death existed,
</p>
<p>and the lawgiver was strong enough to vindicate the law. Richelieu was in
</p>
<p>fact a patriot unsoftened by philanthropy. As in Venice (where the favourite
</p>
<p>aphorism was, Venice first,* Christianity next), so, with Richelieu, the piimary

<p>consideration was, " what will be best for flie Country ?" He had no abstract
</p>
<p>principle, whether as a politician or a priest, when applied to the world
</p>
<p>that lay beyond the boundaries of France. Thus he, whose object was to
</p>
<p>found in France a splendid and imperious despotism assisted the Parlia-
</p>
<p>mentary party in England, and signed a treaty of alliance and subsidies with the
</p>
<p>Catalan rebels for the establishment of a Republic in Barcelona ; to convulso
</p>
<p>other Monarchies was to consolidate the growing Monarchy of France. So he,
</p>
<p>who completely crushed the Protestant party at home, braved all the wrath of
</p>
<p>the Vatican, and even the resentment of the King, in giving the most essential
</p>
<p>aid to the Protestants abroad. There was, indeed, a largeness of view in his
</p>
<p>hostility to the French Huguenots, which must be carefully distinguished
</p>
<p>from the intolerance of the mere priest. He opposed them, not as a Catholic,
</p>
<p>but as a Statesman. The Huguenots were strong republicans, and had formed
</p>
<p>plans for dividing France into provincial commonwealths ; and the existence
</p>
<p>of Rochelle was absolutely incompatible with the integrity of the French Mo-
</p>
<p>narchy. It was a second capital held by the Huguenots, claiming independent
</p>
<p>authority, and the right to treat with Foreign Powers. Richelieu's final
</p>
<p>conquest was marked by a humanity, that had nothing of the bigot. Tlie
</p>
<p>Huguenots obtained a complete amnesty, and had only to regret the loss of
</p>
<p>privileges and fortifications which could not have existed with any security to
</p>
<p>the rest of France.

<p>* It is well known that when, on his death-bed, Richelieu was asked if he
</p>
<p>forgave his enemies: he replied, " I never had any, but those of the State."
</p>
<p>And this was true enough, for Richelieu and the State were one.
</p>
<p>f Richelieu's vindication of himself from cruelty will be found in various
</p>
<p>parts of Petitot's Collection, vols. xxi. xxx. (6'.)

</p>
<p>Its rising roots not up ; but never yet
</p>
<p>Did one least barrier by a ripple vex 70
</p>
<p>My onward tide., unswept in sport away.
</p>
<p>Am I so ruthless then that I do hate
</p>
<p>Them who hate me ? Tush, tush ! I do not hate ;
</p>
<p>Nay, I forgive. The Statesman writes the doom,
</p>
<p>But the Priest sends the blessing. I forgive them,
</p>
<p>But I destroy ; forgiveness is mine own,
</p>
<p>Destruction is the State's ! For private life,

<p>Scripture the guide for public, Machiavel.

<p>Would Fortune serve me if the Heaven were wroth ?

<p>rope." The death of Wallenstein, sacrificed by the Emperor Ferdinand, pro-
</p>
<p>duced a most lively impression upon Richelieu. He found many traits of com-
</p>
<p>parison between Ferdinand and Louis Walleiistein and himself. In the
</p>
<p>Memoirs now regarded by the best authorities as written by his sanction, and
</p>
<p>in great part by himself the great Frenchman bursts (when alluding to Wal-
</p>
<p>lenstein's murder) into a touching and pathetic anathema on the misere de
</p>
<p>cette vie of dependence on jealous and timid royalty, which he himself, while he
</p>
<p>wrote, sustained. It is worthy of remark, that it was precisely at the period of
</p>
<p>Wallenstein's death that Richelieu obtained from the king an augmentation of
</p>
<p>bis guard.
</p>
<p>* Richelieu was commonly supposed, though I cannot say I find much evi-
</p>
<p>dence for it, to have been too presuming in an interview with Anne of Austria
</p>
<p>(the Queen), and to have bitterly resented the contempt she expressed for him.
</p>
<p>The Duke of Buckingham's frantic and Quixotic passion for the Queen is well

<p>known.

<p>when the ill-fated but unprincipled Cinq Mars, whom he called le cher ami, was
</p>
<p>beheaded, he drew out his watch at the fatal hour, and said with a smile, " I
</p>
<p>think at this moment that le cher ami fait une vilaine mine." Neverthe-
</p>
<p>less his conscience at times (for he was devout and superstitious) made him
</p>
<p>gei.tle, and his pride and his honour would often, when least expected, rouse him
</p>
<p>into haughty but brief resistance to the despotism under which he lived.
</p>
<p>* Louis had some musical taste and accomplishment, wherewith he often

</p>
<p>was never weary of repeating to the King that he (Baradas) would have made

<p>just as great a minister as Richelieu. It is on the attachment of Baradas to
</p>
<p>La Cressias, a maid of honour to the Queen Mother, of whom, according to
</p>
<p>Baradas, the King was enamoured also, that his love for the Julie de Mortemar

<p>of the play has been founded. The secret of Buradas" sudden and extraordinary

<p>influence with the King seems to vest in the personal adoration which he pro-

<p>duelling a capital crime. Never was the punishment against the offence more

<p>(latterly so deathlike, save when the mind spoke in the features) always lent
</p>
<p>itself to stage effect of this nature. The queen mother said of him, that she

<p>No let us own it : there is ONE above

<p>Ev'n better than prime ministers;

<p>Alas !
</p>
<p>Our glories float between the earth and heaven

<p>Like clouds which seem pavilions of the sun,
</p>
<p>And are the playthings of the casual wind;

<p>Still, like the cloud which drops on unseen crags

<p>The dews the wild flower feeds on, our ambition

<p>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE ODES.
</p>
<p>.TiiE connexion between the Lyric and Dramatic forms
</p>
<p>of poetical composition is sufficiently ancient and established
</p>
<p>to warrant me, I trust, in subjoining to an Historical Play
</p>
<p>three attempts, equally elaborate, in the less cultivated art
</p>
<p>of the Historical Ode. Written at least, with the advantage
</p>
<p>of mature experience, I venture to express a hope that these
</p>
<p>Odes may, in some degree, redeem the faults of poems put
</p>
<p>forth, a few years since, in the rashness of early youth :
</p>
<p>If I require an additional apology for associating them
</p>
<p>with the Drama of " Richelieu," let me frankly acknowledge
</p>
<p>that I am not uninfluenced by the belief, that, should their
</p>
<p>more obtrusive companion meet with any success, they are
</p>
<p>likely to obtain a larger circle of readers, and therefore a
</p>
<p>fairer judgment, than, in the present indisposition to poetry,
</p>
<p>an author whose reputation, such as it may be, lies in other
</p>
<p>departments of literature, could reasonably expect for a
</p>
<p>volume exclusively devoted to lyrical compositions : and,
</p>
<p>on the other hand, if impartial judges should pass an un-
</p>
<p>favourable verdict on their pretensions, I have, at least, put
</p>
<p>them forward in a more unassuming shape than that of a
</p>
<p>separate publication.

</p>
<p>" She refused all consolation ; few words she uttered, and they were all ex-
</p>
<p>pressive of some hidden grief which she cared not to reveal. But sighs and
</p>
<p>groans were the chief vi nt which she gave to her despondency, and which tho'
</p>
<p>they discovered her sonows were never able to ease or assuage them. Ten
</p>
<p>days and nights she lay upon the carpet leaning on cushions which her maids

<p>brought her, &c." Hume.

</p>
<p>illness, after describing the passionate anguish of her sighs, observes, " that,
</p>
<p>in all his lifetime before, he never knew her fetch a sigh but when the Queen
</p>
<p>of Scots was beheaded." Yet this Robert Carey, the well-born mendicant
</p>
<p>of her bounty, was the first whose eager haste and joyous countenance told
</p>
<p>James that the throne of the Tudors was at last vacant.

<p>* " When she (Elizabeth) was conducted thro' London amidst the joyful

<p>acclamations of her subjects, a boy, who personated Truth, was let down from

<p>t Robert Dudley, afterwards the Leicester of doubtful fame, attended

<p>Elizabeth in her passage to the Tower. The streets, as she passed along,
</p>
<p>were spread with the finest gravel ; banners and pennons, hangings of silk,

<p>ODE II.
</p>
<p>CROMWELL'S DREAM.
</p>
<p>[The conception of this Ode originated in a popular tradition of Cromwell's
</p>
<p>earlier days. It is thus strikingly related by Mr. Forster, in his recent and
</p>
<p>very valuable Life of Cromwell : " He had laid himself down, too fatigued
</p>
<p>to hope for sleep, when suddenly the curtains of his bed were slowly with-
</p>
<p>drawn by a gigantic figure, which bore the aspect of a woman, and which,
</p>
<p>gazing at him silently for a while, told him that he should, before his
</p>
<p>death, be the greatest man in England. He remembered when he told
</p>

</p>
<p>We smile to see the gauds that mov'd our awe,
</p>
<p>Purple and orb ; in dusty lumber lie,
</p>
<p>Alas, what thousands, on the stage of Time,

<p>Between two and three weeks afterwards, when the King was on board the

<p>t hat Caraecioli had risen from the bottom of the sea, and was coining as fast
</p>
<p>as he could to Naples, swimming half out of the water. The day being fair,
</p>
<p>Nelson, to please the King, stood out to sea; but the ship had not proceeded
</p>
<p>far, before a body was distinctly seen upright in the wat--r, and approaching
</p>
<p>them. It was soon recognized to be, indeed, the corpse of Caraecioli, which
</p>
<p>had risen and floated, while the great weights attached to the legs kept the

<p>body in a position like that of a living man. Sottthey's Ne'son.
