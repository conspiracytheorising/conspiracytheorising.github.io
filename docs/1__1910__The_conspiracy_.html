<p>THE CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>SCENE  Office of Dk. Keppler's Private Sanitarium. Afternoon.
</p>
<p>Scene set in 3. Doors l. i. r. i. and r. c. Desk c. at back, chair at
</p>
<p>desk, pen, ink, paper, etc., on desk. Bell on desk. TeJeplione at
</p>
<p>desk. Other furnhture as desired to dress stage. Lights full up.
</p>
<p>(As curtain rises. Dr. Keppler is discovered writing at desk. He
</p>
<p>continues writing for a few seconds, then telephone rings. Dr. tiums
</p>
<p>and takes up receiver).
</p>
<p>Doctor  Hello, hello! Yes, this is Dr. Keppler What's that? Oh,
</p>
<p>is that you, Hartman? No, I'm afraid I can't just now. I have an
</p>
<p>appointment. Can't you call around in about two hours? Very im-
</p>
<p>portant, eh? Well, I'm sorry, but that is the best I can do for you.
</p>
<p>All right, good-bye. (Han^s up receiver, turns about in his chair
</p>
<p>and faces audience). Hang Blakely, why doesn't he hurry? (Looks
</p>
<p>at his icatch). It's away past the time now! (Rises). Here Hart-
</p>
<p>man wants to see me most particularly, but I've got to put him off
</p>
<p>just to wait Blakely's motion. I'll be mighty glad when Blakely
</p>
<p>gets this business over with! It is the most damnable piece of
</p>
<p>work that I ever handled. Callous-hearted scoundrel that I am, this
</p>
<p>affair grates on my nerves. (Saunters across stage, hands in his
</p>
<p>pocket). Still it means a fortune to me. (Loud groans off r.).
</p>
<p>There's seventeen again  hang that fellow! (Opens door r. i. and
</p>
<p>shouts). Ferguson, keep that fellow quiet, will you?
</p>
<p>Voice off R. I.  All right, sir!
</p>
<p>Dr.  (Looking at his watch). No signs of Blakely yet! I guess
</p>
<p>I'll go in and have a chat with my pretty young charge in the mean-
</p>
<p>time. (Exits R. I.).
</p>
<p>(After a pause, a key grates in the lock of door r. c, the door is
</p>
<p>pushed slowly and cautiously open, and Jack Blakely enters cau-
</p>
<p>tiously looking haggard, and to all appearances "a raving maniac.'*
</p>
<p>He looks cautiously about the room).
</p>
<p>Jack  Ha, ha,  I'm all alone ! He's not here ! That's good, that's
</p>
<p>good! I wish he would never come back! But that is not to be

</p>
<p>that fiend will return and keep up his hellish work. Yes, yes, I
</p>
<p>4 THE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>know he will. (Cowering in fear). Oh, oh! How I fear that man!
</p>
<p>He gives me drugs to take away my reason. I suppose he is in
</p>
<p>there now, torturing those poor devils. (A laugh ofj' r. i.). There
</p>
<p>he is, hear that laugh? Oh, what a laugh! I can't bear to hear
</p>
<p>it! {A laugh off r. l). There it is again. Isn't it awful? Awful!
</p>
<p>It sounds hollow as if it came out of a skull. Oh, what a fiend
</p>
<p>that man is! A man? No, he can't be a man. No, no, I know who
</p>
<p>he is  ^he is Satan  the prince of Hell! Ha! ha! ha! (Laughs
</p>
<p>wildly  BUS: suitable to the ravings of a maniac and  ).
</p>
<p>(Enter Dr. and Nellie Blakely, r. i.).
</p>
<p>Dr.  Well, how the devil did you get out?
</p>
<p>Jack  (Dropping on his knees am.d clutching the Dr. around the
</p>
<p>legs in fear). Oh, don't give me any more of that drug. I'll be
</p>
<p>quiet  I won't give you any more trouble. No, no, I won't, I pro-
</p>
<p>mise j^ou I won't ! For God's sake, don't give me any more ! It
</p>
<p>makes my brain reel. I think and see such strange tnmgs. Oh,
</p>
<p>please don't, please don't!
</p>
<p>Dr.  (Chuckling sardonically and pushing him aioay from him).
</p>
<p>All right, I won't  just now !
</p>
<p>Jack  (Raving ivildly). There goes that infernal laugh again!
</p>
<p>Stop it! Stop it, I say,  for God's sake, stop it! It's horrible, hor-
</p>
<p>rible  it drives me mad! (Dr. chuckles sardonically). There it
</p>
<p>is again. Oh, it's horrible, horrible! I know you  you're Satan.
</p>
<p>Satan has a black mustache and goatee  like you. I wouldn't care
</p>
<p>if you would only stop that terrible laugh! I can't bear it, it
</p>
<p>pierces my very soul! Ha, ha! (Laughs wildly). There! I drown-
</p>
<p>ed you that time! If I can't stop you, I can laugh with you. Ha;
</p>
<p>ha; ha! (Raves and laughs wildly).
</p>
<p>Dr.  ^^Enough of this, get in there where you belong. (Pushes him
</p>
<p>in r. c. locks door).
</p>
<p>Dr.  How careless of me to leave that door unlocked !
</p>
<p>Nellie Oh, Heaven! Isn't that terrible? Who is that poor fel-
</p>
<p>low?
</p>
<p>Dr.  Oh, that is a poor unfortunate that is here under my treat-

<p>ment (Aside). Poor girl, doesn't recognize her own husband!
</p>
<p>Well, it's not to be wondered at, the condition he is now in! (To
</p>
<p>Nellie). How are you feeling now, my dear?
</p>
<p>l^ellie  I feel so strangely! My brain seems to be all confused,
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY. 5
</p>
<p>I can't think clearly. I haven't any recollection of anything, my
</p>
<p>mind wanders. Where am I, who are you?
</p>
<p>Dr.  .\Ie? Why, I am the gentleman who conducts this charm-
</p>
<p>ing retreat!
</p>
<p>A^eZZie Retreat?
</p>
<p>Dr,  ^Retreat, I say again, because it is a place where those wea-
</p>
<p>ry in mind may find rest. I have many testimonials to its value in
</p>
<p>that respect.
</p>
<p>Nellie  There is something  something, I do not understand in
</p>
<p>your words. Tell me what it all means.
</p>
<p>Dr.  Yes, I will tell you, because the rule of the establishment
</p>
<p>is "absolutely no secrecy." We believe in kindness, too, as long as
</p>
<p>kindness will work.
</p>
<p>Nellie  For Heaven's sake, speak !
</p>
<p>Dr.^  Now be calm, my dear, young lady. It will hasten your re-
</p>
<p>covery to exercise your self-control.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Recovery?
</p>
<p>Z>r. Yes, I do not think your reason is greatly impaired, and this
</p>
<p>is a famous institution for restoring reason to those who have lost
</p>
<p>it.
</p>
<p>Nellie  An Asylum !
</p>
<p>Dr.  I think retreat is a more pleasant word.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Why am I here, in this place  an asylum?
</p>
<p>Dr. Why are most people generally sent to a place of this kind,
</p>
<p>my dear?
</p>
<p>Nellie  But I am not insane.
</p>
<p>Dr.  That's what they all say.
</p>
<p>Nellie  -I can't understand. Who put me here?
</p>
<p>Dr.  Your husband, of course I
</p>
<p>Nellie  I don't believe it. It is some trap. If he put me here,
</p>
<p>why doesn't he come to see me?
</p>
<p>Dr.  Because it would be dangerous! You must avoid all excite-
</p>
<p>ment, if you wish to hasten your recovery.
</p>
<p>Nellie  I tell you I'm not insane! How long have I been here?

</p>
<p>Dr.  Nearly two weeks. You see you have no recollection of any-
</p>
<p>thing. That should convince you that your mind is impaired.
</p>
<p>Nellie  There is some strange mystery about this. I have a vague
</p>
<p>recollection of coming here with my brother-in-law, he said he wish-
</p>
<p>ed to intercede for a friend, and didn't care to come alone. You
</p>
<p>gave me a glass of wine, after that everything seemed a blank.
</p>
<p>6 THE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Dr.  ( Stffnifican tly ) . Yes.
</p>
<p>-t^ellie  Great Heaven! I'm beginning to understand now. Dr.
</p>
<p>Keppler, you drugged me!
</p>
<p>Dr.  Hush, my dear  calm yourself! Why should I do anything
</p>
<p>of that kind?
</p>
<p>'Nellie  ^There is some deep plot being hatched out here that I am
</p>
<p>aware of. For some reason or other, I am wanted out of the way.
</p>
<p>But I'll not stay another minute. Let me go! Do you hear, let
</p>
<p>me go!
</p>
<p>Dr.  (Grabbing her). Not quite yet, my dear. (Nellie slaps Ms
</p>
<p>face and struggles to free herself). You little spit-fire,  you can
</p>
<p>scratch worse than a tiger! You must calm yourself, my dear. You
</p>
<p>need a good rest, let me assist you to your room, your mind is
</p>
<p>weary and worn out.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Dr. Keppler, you're a fieud. You must be Satan himself!
</p>
<p>Dr.  You flatter me, my dear. I haven't the great honor of be-
</p>
<p>ing his Satanic majesty himself, but I trust I have the honor of be-
</p>
<p>ing one of the most obedient servants. (Chuckles sar(lonically
</p>
<p>mid bows very loic, Nellie staggers and faints in the Dr's. arms).
</p>
<p>Poor girl, swooned, eh? Isn't it singular how many take it that
</p>
<p>way? Well, I'll let Ferguson look after her. (Carries Nellie off
</p>
<p>E. I., then returns, looks at his ivatch impatiently. Bell rings off
</p>
<p>L.).
</p>
<p>Dr.  At last! (Xes stage and exits l. l, after a pause lie re-
</p>
<p>enters, followed by Jim Blakely).
</p>
<p>Dr.  (Angrily). Hang it, man, do you know you are over an
</p>
<p>hour late? I can't monkey around this way. I could have had an-
</p>
<p>other valuable appointment, but I had to postpone it on your ac-
</p>
<p>count !
</p>
<p>Jim  I 'm sorry to keep you waiting, Dr.. but it couldn't be help-
</p>
<p>ed. I've just come from the old man  I had a good, long talk with
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>Dr.  (Motioning to a chair). Sit down. (Jim sits, Dr. sits at
</p>
<p>desk). How is he coming?

<p>Jim  That drug of yours is doing its work well ! He's about  
</p>
<p>Dr.  (Interrupting him). Yes, yes I know. But how about the
</p>
<p>other matter?
</p>
<p>Jim  Great! I've switched him around to my side at last. All
</p>
<p>that is lacking is the drawing up of his will, and that he has a-
</p>
<p>greed to do this very afternoon.
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY. 7
</p>
<p>Dr.  Good! How about Jack, is he hopelessly out of the running?
</p>
<p>Jim  Hopelessly! I had a tough job convincing the old man that
</p>
<p>Jack is a drug fiend of the vilest type, but I managed to do it!
</p>
<p>Dr.  (GhuckUng). Drug fiend? That's right too, but who's the
</p>
<p>cause of it, eh?
</p>
<p>Jim  But even with Jack out of the running, I had no easy task
</p>
<p>of bringing him to terms. The old fool was a little inclined to
</p>
<p>leave his coin to that new institution that is being erected up town !
</p>
<p>The old boy never did fancy me to any great extent.
</p>
<p>Dr.  I should hope not! By jove, Blakely, you're about the 
</p>
<p>Jim  Tut, tut. Dr.  don't get personal. You're no saint yourself,
</p>
<p>if it were only known. Remember it is only through you, with
</p>
<p>^ your skilled hand, that I can accomplish this trick!
</p>
<p>Dr.  Quite right! Without Dr. Keppler, where could you obtain
</p>
<p>a drug that would slowly but surely, eat away your uncle's life,
</p>
<p>without leaving any trace behind it? There is but one Dr. Keppler,
</p>
<p>if I do say it myself.
</p>
<p>Jim  Dr. you're a wonder. I can't comprehend! Why, that drug
</p>
<p>is eating away his life, inch by inch, and the physicians are still
</p>
<p>unable to fathom the mystery.
</p>
<p>Dr.  You bet they are! He will waste away before their very
</p>
<p>eyes, and the only cause they can attribute death to, is old age, or
</p>
<p>something of that sort. Oh, it's a wonderful drug ! It took me years
</p>
<p>to develop it, but it's worth all the labor.
</p>
<p>Jim  How much longer will he linger on like this?
</p>
<p>Dr.  Perhaps a month or so, that drug is slow but sure!
</p>
<p>Jim  Too long! I am now assured of his fortune, and the quick-
</p>
<p>er we can wind up this job, the better! I suppose you know all a-
</p>
<p>bout poisons, Dr.?
</p>
<p>Dr.  I should hope so, I spent the best part of my life studying
</p>
<p>them, in France.
</p>
<p>Jim  Have you a drug that will do the work in a breath, without
</p>
<p>leaving any trace or cause any suspicion to be attached to anyone
</p>
<p>in consequence?

<p>Dr. Yes!
</p>
<p>Jim  Good! The time has come, Dr. I intend to

<p>Dr.  {Coughing tehind his hand). To poison a dog?
</p>
<p>Jim  Well, yes, if you will have it that way. Do you think you
</p>
<p>can help me?
</p>
<p>Dr.  I think so, just excuse me for a moment, (rises and exits

<p>E. I.).

<p>(Jim 1-iscs and paces floor. BUS: A Tcey is heard in lock of door
</p>
<p>E. c. and Jack enters cautiously. Jim doesn't notice his entrance and
</p>
<p>Xes and sits hy desk with his hack to Jack).
</p>
<p>Jack Ha., ha, he doesn't know I've got this key. Ha, ha ! Where
</p>
<p>is that fiend? (Discovers Jim). Ah, there he sits! There he is, the
</p>
<p>fiend ! I must do it ! I must do it ! Yes, yes, I must. Then I won't
</p>
<p>hear his awful laugh any more. Yes, I must kill him, kill him I Yes,
</p>
<p>yes, I must kill him ! Get my hands about his throat and choke his
</p>
<p>infernal life into the very depths of hell! Ha! Ha! Ha! (Raves and
</p>
<p>laughs fiendishly. Jim now discovers him).
</p>
<p>Jim  (Rising horrified). Great Heavens It is Jack  ^my brother!
</p>
<p>What a wreck he is, and I am the cause of it! Great Heavens!,
</p>
<p>How did he get out? I wish the Dr. would hurry!
</p>
<p>Jack  You are not he. No, no! The other has a black goatee!
</p>
<p>But you are a devil too. Oh, I can tell, yes, I can tell! This place
</p>
<p>must be full of devils! (Pointing to the fioor). Look! Look! Look!
</p>
<p>Don't you see them? A whole lot of little devils running around the
</p>
<p>floor? (To Jim). You must be the king. Yes, the king. With the
</p>
<p>king dead, the rest will leave. Yes, yes, I must kill the king! Ha!
</p>
<p>Ha! (Laughs fiendishly and approaclies Jim).
</p>
<p>Jim  (Backing away from him in terror). Great Heavens! He
</p>
<p>will kill me! Why doesn't the Dr. hurry?
</p>
<p>Jack  So you fear me, eh? Ha! Ha! Ha! (Laughs wildly). I
</p>

<p>Jack  {Releasing Jim and cowering hefore the Dr.)- So, it's you
</p>
<p>come back! I thought you had gone for good.
</p>
<p>Dr.  You get back in there where you belong! {Pushes Jack
</p>
<p>through r. c). Well I'll be hanged. I could have sworn that I
</p>
<p>locked that door. (Locks door and assists Jim to his feet).
</p>
<p>Jim  (FeeNy). You came just in time. That brute would have
</p>
<p>killed me.
</p>
<p>Df.  Brute, did you say? We are the brutes, he is only what we
</p>
<p>have made him !
</p>
<p>Jim  (Shuddering). Horrible! Horrible!
</p>
<p>Dr.-  This spell of his will only lasts a short time now, then he will
</p>
<p>be as rational as ever, until I drug him again.
</p>
<p>Jim  Don't! For Heaven's sake don't! Let him go before it is
</p>
<p>too late! I had no idea what a wreck we were making of him.
</p>
<p>Dr.  You're losing your nerve, brace up I You can't turn back
</p>
<p>now, you've gone too far. You can't afford to let a million dollars
</p>
<p>slip through your grasp, just because your feelings give way. Here,
</p>
<p>I'll fix you up. (Xes to desk and takes out a flask, pours a drink).
</p>
<p>Here, take a swig of this, that will put you on your pins again.
</p>
<p>(Jim Xes and drains glass). There, I'll bet you feel better already!
</p>
<p>Jmi  "icou're right. I'm a fool to let my feelings get the better
</p>
<p>of me. But, that sight unnerved me. Have you the drug?
</p>
<p>Dr.  Yes. (Takes bottle from his pocket). Here's the article
</p>
<p>you need. I should think you could drop it in a cup of tea, I mean
</p>
<p>milk. Five or six drops will be sufficient. It is tasteless, and will
</p>
<p>leave no trace whatever.
</p>
<p>Jim  How much is it?
</p>
<p>Dr. One thousand dollars. You must realize that this is danger-
</p>
<p>ous business. It isn't like taking care of a troublesome friend. I
</p>
<p>don't mind running an account in such a case, but in this I shall
</p>
<p>have to have cash.
</p>
<p>Jim  Here's your money. (Counts out several Mils and hands

<p>that! I intend to skip the country, and that girl goes with me

<p>Dr.  Here is a friend to see you, my dear. ^

<p>Jimr(To Dr.). Leave us alone.

<p>Jiin  How do you feel, Nellie?
</p>
<p>Nellie  Oh, Jim, why do you keep me in this awful place? I'm
</p>
<p>not insane.
</p>
<p>Jim  Don't excite yourself, Nellie, Dr. Keppler has discovered that
</p>
<p>your mind is slightly deranged. But don't take it so hard, dear, you
</p>
<p>will be all right again in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>Nellie 1 tell you I'm not insane. It is some trap to get me out
</p>
<p>of the way. Dr.  Keppler is a fiend incarnate  he gives me drugs
</p>
<p>that take away my reason. Jim, I believe that you have something
</p>
<p>to do with this.
</p>
<p>Jim  Nellie, calm yourself. You don't realize what you are saying,
</p>
<p>dear. I am trying my best to get you out of here, and I will suc-

<p>ceed if you will only trust me.
</p>
<p>Nellie Where is Jack, why doesn't he come and see me?
</p>
<p>Jim  Don't speak of him, Nellie.

<p>Nellie  What is wrong? Why do you speak like that?
</p>
<p>Jim  Nellie, I can't bear to tell you.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Speak, I must know! I have a right to know.
</p>
<p>Jim  I would rather spare you this blow, Nellie. But since you

<p>here !
</p>
<p>Nellie  Jim, do you know what you are saying? Why would Jack
</p>
<p>do a thing like this?
</p>
<p>Jim  To be plain, he wanted you out of the way. I wished to
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY. 11
</p>
<p>spare you this blow, but you forced me to speak.
</p>
<p>KeUie Oh, God, I can't believe it! Why should he wish me out
</p>
<p>of the way?
</p>
<p>Jim  Simply because he is tired of you and wants his freedom.
</p>
<p>But that isn't the worst, I have dreadful news! Do you think you
</p>
<p>can bear it?
</p>
<p>XeUie  In heaven's name, speak! This suspense is driving me
</p>
<p>mad !
</p>
<p>Jim  Your husband is dead.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Dead?
</p>
<p>Jim  Yes. -
</p>
<p>liellie  Oh. this is dreadful! How did it happen?
</p>
<p>Jim  He got mixed up in a drunken brawl downtown, and was
</p>
<p>shot.
</p>
<p>^'e7//e^0h, horrors! Jim, swear to me that you speak the truth!
</p>
<p>Jim  I swear it! What object would I have in deceiving j^ou? I
</p>
<p>tried to spare you this blow, but it had to come out sooner or later,
</p>
<p>so you might as well know everything at once.
</p>
<p>A' r?7/e Everything? What more is there to know?
</p>
<p>Jim  A great deal ! Nellie, your husband has never been a true
</p>
<p>husband to you. I know this is a hard thing to say of my own
</p>
<p>brother, but it's the truth nevertheless. I could have told you all
</p>
<p>this long ago, but I didn't wish to make trouble.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Speak, speak! How has he been untrue to me?
</p>
<p>Jim  By running with other women. Night after night, he would
</p>
<p>tell you he had work to do at the office, when, instead of going to
</p>
<p>his office, he would be downtown carousing with his fast lady friends.
</p>
<p>And now to have more freedom to himself, he gave this Dr. Kep-
</p>
<p>pler a sum of money to pronounce you insane.
</p>
<p>Nellie  But, I came to this place with you, how do you account
</p>
<p>for that?
</p>
<p>Jim  I was deceived. Jack told me to bring you here. Of course,
</p>
<p>he led me to believe you were insane, I had no cause to believe oth-
</p>
<p>erwise. But after I had time to think it over, I began to mistrust.

<p>That is why I am here to-day. I forced the truth from Keppler. I

<p>now intend to get you out of here.
</p>
<p>Nellie Oh, God! What a blow! And Jack, I thought him the
</p>
<p>truest of husbands. Oh, Jack, Jack! How could you? (Sohs).

<p>Jim Don't take on so, Nellie. He is not worth your tears. Un-

<p>12 THE CONSPIEACY.
</p>
<p>of his fortune, and left it all to me. Now, Nellie, I have a confes-
</p>
<p>sion to make, I wasn't in a position to speak before. You were mar-
</p>
<p>ried to my brother, so I, like any other honorable man, held myself
</p>
<p>in check. But now he is dead, and I am free to speak. Nellie, I

<p>my wife.

</p>
<p>Jim  I must speak ! I have alwaj^s loved j'ou, but you loved my
</p>
<p>brother, so I bore my sorrow in silence. But now I have a right to
</p>
<p>speak. Surely you can have no love left for that soulless scoundrel,
</p>
<p>who has so heartlessly deceived you! Come to me, I love you and
</p>
<p>will make you happy.
</p>
<p>Nellie  As if I could ever be happy again, after what has hap-
</p>
<p>pened.
</p>
<p>Jiiii  You can soon forget. We can go far away from here, to
</p>
<p>some strange country, and begin a new life.
</p>
<p>Nellie  Don't torture me, it can never be !
</p>
<p>Jim  Don't say that, Nellie. You surely can't think of remaining
</p>
<p>here in den of this fiend. It is a veritable hell-on-earth !
</p>
<p>Nellie  Oh, no, no, no ! It makes me shudder to think of it !
</p>
<p>Jim  Then come with me, let me be your protector. You are not
</p>
<p>safe in this part of the country. Sooner or later, this fiend will have
</p>
<p>you in his power again. I can get you away from here by buying
</p>
<p>him off for the time being. I'll soon be rich, then we can go to

<p>Australia, and begin a new life. (Nellie doesn't reply). Why hesi-

</p>
<p>Nellie You are right, Jim, I will go with you.

<p>Jim  (Chuckles sardonically, aside, then to Nellie). Bless you,

<p>Nellie. You will never regret it, I will devote my entire life to

<p>making you happy. (Takes her in his arms and kisses her).

<p>saw her in your arms a moment ago.

<p>Jim  It is a true saying that the devil takes care of his own. I
</p>
<p>have succeeded far beyond my expectations. As soon as I can rake

<p>in uncle's fortune, I intend to skip to Australia, and my brother's

<p>Jim  Ten thousand dollars? Do you Intend to bleed me of the

<p>Jim  You've got the drop on me, and you are trying to play it
</p>
<p>for all it's worth. But it's no go. The price is outrageous  I'll not

<p>give it. I'm in account with you now for over twenty thausand.

<p>Jack 11
</p>
<p>Nellie  Yes, he said you wanted me out of the way, so you could
</p>
<p>associate with your fast lady friends, said you had always been

<p>untrue to me. That wasn't the worst, he said you were killed in a

<p>Jack  Great God! My brother told you this? (Nellie nods).
</p>
<p>It's an infamous lie, Nellie! I never deceived you in all my life.
</p>
<p>No other woman in all the world can ever take your place in my
</p>
<p>heart. But I can't understand. Why should my brother so base-
</p>
<p>ly deceive you?
</p>
<p>Nellie  It must be some dastardly plot against us. Jim told me
</p>
<p>your uncle had cut you out of his will, because you were a drug
</p>
<p>fiend, said that was why you were here. He said your uncle had
</p>
<p>left his entire fortune to him, and he wanted me to leave for Aus-
</p>
<p>tralia with him.

<p>cret hidden in my breast. (To Jack). Boy. you are yourself again,
</p>
<p>listen! There is a conspiracy against you. You are not insane,

<p>neither is your wife. It is all the conspiracy of that fiend brother

<p>of yours, to get your uncle's fortune. He has made your uncle be-

<p>lieve that you are a drug-fiend and a scoundrel of the worst type.

</p>
<p>ly run over and killed by an auto, on his way home? (Hangs up

</p>
<p>Nellie  No, Dr. it is retribution. (Dr. gasps and falls back in
</p>
<p>chair dead).

<p>tery will soon be cleared, then nothing but sunshine and happiness
</p>
