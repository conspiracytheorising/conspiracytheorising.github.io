</p>
<p>" The greatest difficulty from the outset, in thewayof a just appreciation by the North of the real nature of this Rebellion,
</p>
<p>has been the fact, that the loyal men who knew most of it were least able to give their testimony. The last echoes
</p>
<p>of the cannon at Sumter had hardly died away before the communications between the two sections were closed ;
</p>
<p>and the northern mind was left to only casual and desultory means of learning the developments of the astound-
</p>
<p>ing iniquity. The consequence was, that it was very slow to apprehend the real malignity and scope of the
</p>
<p>' Therefore, the evidence of such men as Col. Hamilton, and Lorenzo Sherwood, fresh from the active Scenes of the
</p>
<p>Rebellion, and who watched it with penetrating eye from its first step, is of peculiar value. Their conclusions,
</p>
<p>formed on the very spot, face to face with the monster, are of infinitely more weight than the notions of Northern
</p>
<p>men, who know it only by occasional glimpses in the far distance. It is we'l that their testimony should be
</p>
<p>brought before, our intblic, whenever it can be obtained.
</p>
<p>1 The gentlemen who have induced such men to address our people, with instruction and appeal, have done the good
</p>
<p>cau?e precious service. Winging their way, as these speeches do, by the press, through every loyal State, they
</p>
<p>will have a salutary influence of no small moment in the present critical period of the war." * * " Listening
</p>
<p>to such men, the conviction comes home afresh to us, that we of the North, need everywhere and alwaya to pre-
</p>
<p>serve that ETERNAL VIGILANCE which is the PRICE OF LIBERTY."

<p>As the Democratic League was the first " League " formed nearly three years ago for sustaining the National Gov-

<p>leagues " since organized through various States lor defending the National Cause : And it is a source of high satis-
</p>
<p>faction that the various documents issued by it have been read and republished in Europe as well as in America, to an
</p>
<p>extent that indicates a rapidly-increasing appreciation of the thoroughly Democratic Doctrines it has asserted when

<p>No one of the documents thu3 widely disseminated since the war began presented tho great issues of this crisis
</p>
<p>iu a clearer light or at a rtwre important season than the article entitled, ' ' SLAVERY AND NOBILITY versus DEMOC-
</p>
<p>RACY." The high and just ground assumed by that article has been impressing itself moro and more upon the publi
</p>
<p>mind, as the event.s of the Rebellion have successively added practical evidence of tho truthfulness of tho writer in
</p>
<p>depicting the Anti-Democralic motives of the Slavebreeding Aristocracy. To it, moro than to any other similar docu-
</p>
<p>ment, has been ascribed tho merit of having earliest vindicated the rights of tho non-slaveholding whito men, South
</p>
<p>as well as North, and earliest urged the policy of emancipating and arming tho Colored Raco as a necessary measure of
</p>
<p>National Defence agaiast tho Slave-breeding traitors.
</p>
<p>Coming, as that article did, from the pon of a Southern Unionist;  embodying tho long-settled convictions of a well-
</p>
<p>known Democrat, who had thoroughly watched and combated tho movements of tho incipient treason inside and out-
</p>
<p>side of the Texas Legislature  that statement furnished convincing arguments for loyal men throughout the land 
</p>
<p>arguments that could .not be ascribed to "fanaticism," or attributed to any other motivo than a desire to  strike the
</p>
<p>Rebellion at its mosLvulnerable point"
</p>
<p>It is gratifying to know that, while tho treason comes from the South, an effective portion of the antidote comes
</p>
<p>also from that region. While tho views thus calmly an 1 powerfully presented by Mr. I/ORExzo SnsHwoOD settled th
</p>
<p>question of adopting tho policy of Emancipating anil Arming tho Colored Unionists, tho subsequent letter of Geo. An-
</p>
<p>drew Jackson Hamilton powerfully sustained it. Those two publications contributed most largely to arouse and
</p>
<p>strengthen the popular mind in sustenance of these vital measures of National Policy. Gen. Hamilton was among tho
</p>
<p>foremost in approving tho views expressed in this document  " fully concurring " in them  and declarintr (hat  few
</p>
<p>men are so well prepared, from observation, experience, and reflection, to think wisoly and act justly in the promises

</p>
<p>as Mr. Sherwood," with whom he had " in years past watched the inevitable tendency in the South to the present de-
</p>
<p>plorablo condition of our country."
</p>
<p>The effect of this and other documents issued by the Democratic League, in arousing public attention to the vast
</p>
<p>issues involved in the present struggle for National Self-preservation, is briefly illustrated in the following recent re-
</p>
<p>marks of the Continental Monthly : 
</p>
<p>"Amongst all the papers and pamphlets issued from the press during our present war," says tho Continental,
</p>
<p>"none, perhaps, have exercised a more salutary influence than those emanating from the Democratic League. The
</p>
<p>article 'entitled 'Slavery and Nobility vs. Democracy' was originally published in the month of July, 1862. Pro-
</p>
<p>nounced by critics to bo among tho best political articles ever appearing in print, it commanded a very marked atten-
</p>
<p>tion as an exposition of the atrocious motives that underlaid the great Southern rebellion. The public mind was
</p>
<p>startled at tho developed evidenco of a great conspiracy to subvert the fundamaital principles of free government in the
</p>
<p>South. The coalition between tho conspirators of tho South and their allies amongst the aristocracy <>f Kngland was
</p>
<p>laid bare, whilst a great portion of tho English press and reviews was shown to be suborned into the service of the
</p>
<p>most atrocious objects and purposes that ever disgraced the annals of civilization. This article, whilst it elucidated to
</p>
<p>our own countrymen tho secret motives of the rebellion, assisted powerfully to bring a new phase over a perverted
</p>
<p>English public opinion. The result has been that the vitiated disposition of the English aristocracy to assist the rebels,
</p>
<p>through intervention, has slunk away before British morality, and is now seen only in aid of piracy on our com-
</p>
<p>X^=-Thus much is here said for the purpose of showing that no document can now be circulated by loyal men with
</p>
<p>better prospects of promoting the loyal cause. Thousands who at an earlier day would have passed lightly by such
</p>
<p>appeals are now convinced, by the events of the Rebellion, that the causes of that traitorous convulsion he deeper and
</p>
<p>fouler than was not long ago generally supposed. Thousands upon thousands, who before the Rebellion stood flrmly by
</p>
<p>the Democratic. Partv, aro now realizing tho necessity of merging old party names for the present in a zealous support
</p>
<p>of the National Government against the Slave-drivers, whose Rebellion was prompted by tho desire of subverting Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic Principles as well as destroying our National Unity.
</p>
<p>The aid of all such men in and out of tho Loyal Leagues, is now earnestly invoked to further the g 1 cause by
</p>
<p>circulating among their neighbors a document like this now republished, after the ACCURACY OF ITS STATEMENTS
</p>
<p>and the C< dllil-'CTVESS OF ITS PRINCIPLES have been so vividly illustrated by the progress of events in this unparal-

<p>WHO ARE THE REAL "DEMOCRATS"?

</p>
<p>The bare definition of the word democracy answers this question. The term democracy, in its practical, ideal
</p>
<p>sense, signifies popular government. This is formed by enfranchising the masses, giving them political power, and
</p>
<p>throwing upon the people the responsibility of protecting themselves. Aristocracy aims to deny to the common
</p>
<p>people the right of voting, or any voice as to who shall make laws and fill offices. Tliese two opposing principles in
</p>
<p>government are now at war with each other.
</p>
<p>After the secession of the Southern States, when the Southern Confederacy was supposed to bo established, the
</p>
<p>leading Rebels threw off all disguises, and boldly declared in favor of an aristocracy. In all the leading presses, re-
</p>
<p>views, and political literature of rebeldom, has this project of overthrowing democracy and establishing an aristocracy
</p>
<p>been declared and advocated. The rebel orators and letter-writers have been equally explicit. The arguments put forth
</p>
<p>by the conspirators have assumed different forms, but all have the same meaning. Jeff. Davis rails against the demo-
</p>
<p>cratic doctrine of a popular government, and calls it "tho tyranny of a majority." On another occasion, more re-
</p>
<p>cently, he characterizes the popular will as " tho despotism of a majority." It has been a favorite declaration with
</p>
<p>the Secessionists of the South for years that " government through the will of the majority must be abrog ,t.-,l."
</p>
<p>Th - S mlvrn Literary Messenger, assuming to speak as tho exponent of the views of the Southern leaders, says :
</p>
<p>"Let us seek to eradicate every vestige of radical democracy, every feature tending to make ours a popular govern-
</p>
<p>ment," etc. Again, in tho sameprint : " We would not be understood as uniting in the belief of tho impossibility of
</p>
<p>a successful republic, that we cry out for the re-eslablUhmcnt of royally in this freo country." * * * " We have no 6b-
</p>
<p>jtctbmstoroiialU/ when restrained by constitutional barriers." "You well object to the term Democrat"  (says Mr.
</p>
<p>Garnett in liis letter to .Mr. Trescott, of S. C ) " Democracy, in its original, philosophic sense, is indeed incompatible
</p>
<p>with Slavt ryand the whole system of Southern society ; yet, if you look back, what change will you find made in any
</p>
<p>of ourState Constitutions, or iu our legislation in its general course for tho last fifty years, which was not in the direc-
</p>
<p>tion of democracy ?"
</p>
<p>II -re i-s m mifested th" 1 same, repugnance to the will of the majority. De Bow's Review is equally explicit, wherein
</p>
<p>itcontemns tho democratic axiom of " the greatest good of the greatest number" as "a pestilent and pernicious
</p>
<p>dogma." The same articlo winds up with the declaration that " an hereditary Senate and Executive are the political
</p>
<p>form best suited to the genius, and most, expressive of the ideas of the South."
</p>
<p>7he Richmond Examiner, of a very late date, assumes that the priwijilea of popular government, and protection to
</p>
<p>popular right through popular government, i the mistaken civilization of the age, which a perverse generation has liftodup
</p>
<p>in the face of ancient institutions ! De Bow's Review puts in the rejoinder .
</p>
<p>" Th-- real ci\ ilization of a country is in its aristocracy. The masses are moulded tatosoldiers and artisaus by intellect, ju?t as matter and
</p>
<p>the element.- of nature ar*
</p>
<p>paupers. Yet we vi al 1 b
</p>
<p>The Unionists of the South, who for thirty years have faced the monster Rebellion, and listened to the reasonings
</p>
<p>in which it originated, are equally explicit in declaring the contest to be a battle between aristocracy and democracy.
</p>
<p>The whole intelligence of the world understands it as Richard Cobden, of England, understood it when he pronounced
</p>
<p>THE VITAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED IN THE
</p>
<p>SLATE-HOLDERS' REBELLION,
</p>
<p>AGAINST DEMOCKATIC PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS AGAINST
</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL UNITY.
</p>
<p>THE CASE FAIRLY STATED, IN AN ADDRESS TO ALL TRUE DEMOCRATS,
</p>
<p>SLAVERY AND NOBILITY versus DEMOCRACY.
</p>
<p>Few political convulsions have hitherto trans-
</p>
<p>pired, which have so much puzzled the world
</p>
<p>to get at the entire motives of the revolt, as the
</p>
<p>present insurrection in this country. Were
</p>
<p>public opinion to be made up from the politi-
</p>
<p>cal Literature of Great Britain, or its leading jour-
</p>
<p>nals, very little certainty would be arrived at as
</p>
<p>to the merits or demerits of the attempted rev-
</p>
<p>olution. The articles of De Bow's Review
</p>
<p>smack little more of a secession origin that the
</p>
<p>late dissertations on American politics appear-
</p>
<p>ing in the British periodicals. The statements
</p>
<p>of most of the leading English journals are quite
</p>
<p>in keeping. Any one accustomed to the " ear-
</p>
<p>marks" of secession phraseology and declama-
</p>
<p>tion would be at little loss to identify the
</p>
<p>Southern emissary in connection with the .-peri-
</p>
<p>odicals and press of the British Islands. Hence
</p>
<p>the hypocrisy and studied concealment of those
</p>
<p>hidden motives necessary to be made apparent,
</p>
<p>in order to judge of the merits of secession.
</p>
<p>The world has known, that for thirty years
</p>
<p>past there has been a feverish and jealous dis-
</p>
<p>content expressed in the cotton States. It had
</p>
<p>its first ebullition in 1832, when South Caro-
</p>
<p>lina assumed the right to nullify the revenue
</p>
<p>laws of Congress. Since that time the North
</p>
<p>has continually been accused of an aggressive
</p>
<p>policy. Various extravagant pretences have ]

<p>from time to time been raised up by the South,
</p>
<p>and urged as causes for dissolving the Union.
</p>
<p>They have always, until recently, been met by
</p>
<p>forbearance and compromise.
</p>
<p>The extension and perpetuation of slavery
</p>
<p>has been prominent as the open motive for
</p>
<p>Southern political activity ; and equally prom-
</p>
<p>inent as one of the motives for dismembering
</p>
<p>the Union. There has been another project,
</p>
<p>however, in connection with the attempted dis-
</p>
<p>solution of the Union, of a most alarming na-
</p>
<p>ture ; that project was the intended prostration
</p>
<p>of the democratic principle in Southern politics.
</p>
<p>While a privileged order in government was
</p>
<p>made the basis of political ambition by the as-
</p>
<p>pirants or leading spirits, it was also to be made
</p>
<p>the means of perpetuating the institution of
</p>
<p>slavery. Whether these adjuncts, slavery per-
</p>
<p>petuation, and government through a privileged
</p>
<p>class, were twins of the same birth, is not very
</p>
<p>material ; but whether they existed together as
</p>
<p>the joint motive to overthrow the national juris-
</p>
<p>diction, involves very deeply the present and
</p>
<p>continuing questions in American politics.
</p>
<p>To many gentlemen of intelligence and high
</p>
<p>standing in the South, the intended establish-
</p>
<p>ment of a different order of government, based
</p>
<p>on privilege of class, has appeared to be the
</p>
<p>ruling motive. They have set down the ex-
</p>
<p>pressed apprehension as to the insecurity of
</p>
<p>slavery as a hypocritical pretext for revolution ;
</p>
<p>believing that the more absorbing motive was
</p>
<p>to establish an order of nobility, either with or
</p>
<p>without monarchy. There is some plausibility
</p>
<p>for giving the ambitious motive the greater

<p>THE SLAVEHOLDERS CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>trade and commerce, and naturally inclined to
</p>
<p>oppose secession ; but timid in its apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions as to protection, was ready to acquiesce
</p>
<p>in the most extravagant opinions ; in other
</p>
<p>words, like trade and commerce everywhere,
</p>
<p>too much disposed to make merchandise of its
</p>
<p>politics. The balance of the non-slaveholding
</p>
<p>population, if we except a venal pulpit and
</p>
<p>press, had not even a specious motive, pecu-
</p>
<p>niary or political, moral or social, that should
</p>
<p>have drawn it into rebellion. It was part and
</p>
<p>portion of the great brotherhood of free labor,
</p>
<p>and could not by any possibility raise up a
</p>
<p>a plausible pretence of jealousy against its na-
</p>
<p>tural ally  free labor in the North,
</p>
<p>In estimating the strength of a cause, we are
</p>
<p>obliged to take into account the actually exist-
</p>
<p>ing reasons in favor of its support. Delusion,
</p>
<p>founded on a fictitious cause of complaint, is
</p>
<p>but a weak basis for revolution. It may have
</p>
<p>an apparent strength to precipitate revolt, but
</p>
<p>has no power of endurance. There is a re-
</p>
<p>flection that comes through calamity and suffer-
</p>
<p>ing that rises superior to sophistry in the most
</p>
<p>common minds. If not already, this will soon
</p>
<p>be the case with the whole Southern population.
</p>
<p>The slaveholder and the man of trade and com-
</p>
<p>merce who feared the tumult, and would have
</p>
<p>avoided it, will have seen their apprehensions
</p>
<p>turned into the fulfilment of prophecy. The
</p>
<p>non-slaveholding farmer, mechanic, or laborer,
</p>
<p>will be made to see clearly that his interest did

<p>adventurer who planned the conspiracy, is
</p>
<p>already brought to see the fallacy of his dream.
</p>
<p>He may now consider the incongruous mate-
</p>
<p>rials of Southern population. He may view
</p>
<p>that population in classes. He may contem-
</p>
<p>plate it through the medium of its natural mo-
</p>
<p>tives of fidelity to the Government on the one
</p>
<p>hand, and of its artificial delusion on the
</p>
<p>other. He may now go to the bottom of
</p>
<p>Southern society, and find in its conflicting
</p>
<p>elements the antagonistic motives that render
</p>
<p>the plans of treason abortive. These will be
</p>
<p>sure to continue, and sure to strengthen on
</p>
<p>the side of fidelity to tho National Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. "When the South is made a solid, com-
</p>
<p>pact unit in political motive, it will become so
</p>
<p>disarmed of all purposes of treason.
</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly asserted that the
</p>
<p>^outh was a political unit on the question of
</p>
<p>attempted revolution. This declaration has
</p>
<p>been reiterated by the Southern press, by trav-
</p>
<p>ellers, and by all the influences connected with
</p>
<p>the rebellion. It is not now necessary to de-
</p>
<p>lineate tho quasi military organization of the
</p>
<p>Knights of the Golden Circle, or their opera-
</p>
<p>tions in cajoling and terrorizing the Southern
</p>
<p>population into acquiescence. Much unanim-
</p>
<p>ity through this process was made to appear
</p>
<p>on the surface ; but it is more palpable to the
</p>
<p>analytic mind acquainted with Southern so-
</p>
<p>ciety, that the very means employed to enforce
</p>
<p>acquiescence afforded also the evidence that
</p>
<p>there was a strong under-current of aversion.
</p>
<p>"Willing apostacy from allegiance to the Union

<p>needed no terrorizing from mobs or murderers.

<p>it fully reconciled to the pretended monopoly I
</p>
<p>of respectability by slaveholders. Under this i
</p>
<p>corroded feeling, much of the white labor of
</p>
<p>the South had emigrated to the free States.
</p>
<p>In 1850, seven hundred and thirty-two thou-
</p>
<p>sand of these emigrants were living. Their
</p>
<p>communications and intercourse showed to
</p>
<p>their old friends, relatives, and acquaintances,
</p>
<p>that they had found homes and friendly treat-
</p>
<p>ment on Northern soil ; and in addition there-
</p>
<p>to, a much better and more encouraging con-
</p>
<p>dition of society for the industrious white
</p>
<p>man. The feeling reflected back from the
</p>
<p>free to the slave States was analogous to that
</p>
<p>thrown back from the United States to Ireland.
</p>
<p>Its effect was also the same. Under its influ-
</p>
<p>ence nearly two millions are now living in the
</p>
<p>free States who are the offshoot and increase
</p>
<p>of a Southern extraction. Slaveholders merely
</p>
<p>complained of this flow of population, on the
</p>
<p>ground that it contributed to overthrow the
</p>
<p>balance of political power. It woidd not, per-
</p>
<p>haps, be amiss to conclude that they saw with
</p>
<p>equal clearness the incentives that induced
</p>
<p>the emigration  a silent logic of facts against
</p>
<p>slavery.
</p>
<p>The census statistics, commencing with 1840,
</p>
<p>have contributed much to play the mischief
</p>
<p>with the equanimity of slaveholders. They
</p>
<p>have always known that thorough education in
</p>
<p>the South was mainly confined to their own
</p>
<p>families. When, however, the discovery was

<p>THE SLAVEHOLDERS CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>of the States which have introduced diversified
</p>
<p>industry stands on a high scale of production.
</p>
<p>Contrast Massachusetts and South Carolina, the
</p>
<p>two leading States in the promulgation of oppo-
</p>
<p>site theories. These two States have often been
</p>
<p>censured for the contumelious manner in which
</p>
<p>they have sometimes sought to repel each other's
</p>
<p>arguments. The one is in favor of ' free trade. '
</p>
<p>The other says : ' No State can flourish to much
</p>
<p>extent without diversified industry.' The one
</p>
<p>says : ' Open everything to free competition. '
</p>
<p>The other replies : ' Are you aware that the in-
</p>
<p>terest on manufacturing capital in Europe is
</p>
<p>much lower ; that skilled labor is more abun-
</p>
<p>dant ; and that free trade would dash to the
</p>
<p>ground most of the manufacturing we have
</p>
<p>started into growth under protection through
</p>
<p>our revenue laws?' 'Let it be so,' says Caro-
</p>
<p>lina ; ' what right exists to adopt a national
</p>
<p>policy that does not equally benefit all sections ?'
</p>
<p>' The very object of the policy,' replies Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts, ' is, that it should benefit all sections ;
</p>
<p>and the most desirable object of all, in the eye
</p>
<p>of beneficence, would be. that it should benefit
</p>
<p>the laboring white population of the cotton
</p>
<p>States, as well as others. ' ' But, ' says Carolina,
</p>
<p>' this diversified industry can not be introduced,
</p>
<p>to much extent, where slavery exists. ' ' That
</p>
<p>is an argument by implication, ' says Massachu-
</p>
<p>setts, ' that you more prize slavery than you do
</p>
<p>the interests and welfare of the bulk of your
</p>
<p>white population. ' ' Who set you up to be a

</p>
<p>part of the popidation South ?' ' I assume to
</p>
<p>judge for myself,' rephes Massachusetts, ' as to
</p>
<p>that national policy which is designed to affect
</p>
<p>beneficially the twenty-seven millions of people
</p>
<p>who are obliged to obtain subsistence through
</p>
<p>personal industry ; theirs is the great cause of
</p>
<p>white humanity in its shirt sleeves ; and it be-
</p>
<p>hooves the National Government to take care
</p>
<p>of that cause, and to foster it ; and not to sub-
</p>
<p>mit to the narrow selfishness of a few slave-
</p>
<p>holders. '
</p>
<p>It may readily be seen that this controversy,
</p>
<p>growing out of the opposite theories of selfish
</p>
<p>slaveholders on the one hand, and a spirit of
</p>
<p>beneficence, blended with the idea of a wide-
</p>
<p>spread advantage on the other, not only involves
</p>
<p>directly the demerits of slavery in its prejudical
</p>
<p>effect on the non-slaveholding population, but
</p>
<p>also the great question of raising up skilled
</p>
<p>labor in all the States. It is thus clearly de-
</p>
<p>monstrated that our national policy should be
</p>
<p>exempt from the control of an arrogant and
</p>
<p>selfish class. Slaveholders have had little sym-
</p>
<p>pathy with the great bulk of the white people
</p>
<p>in the Union ; at most, they have never mani-
</p>
<p>fested it. Few of them can be trusted politi-
</p>
<p>cally, where a broad industrial policy is con-
</p>
<p>cerned. No one is better aware than the polit-
</p>
<p>ical slaveholder of the crushing effect of slavery
</p>
<p>on the interests of the non-slaveholding popu-
</p>
<p>lation in the slave States ; hence their jealousy
</p>
<p>of this population as a voting, governing power.
</p>
<p>The Southern political mind, connected with
</p>
<p>slaveholding, is astute when sharpened by jeal-
</p>
<p>ousy. There -is no phase in political economy,
</p>
<p>AGAINST DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES

<p>the result of thirty years' concoction under I atrocious wrong, is the same. The disposition

<p>The slaveholders' rebellion has assumed a mag- i natural rights, or to modify the status of so-
</p>
<p>nitude commensurate only with long contem- ! ciety under the severity of oppression, is the
</p>
<p>plation of the subject. Making all due allow- same ; and no tyranny has yet been found so
</p>
<p>ance for the honorable exceptions, this is sub- tenacious or objectionable as the tyranny of a

<p>the Union. ! Our forefathers had a just conception of the
</p>
<p>Were further argument needed to establish I nature of the case, on one hand, when they in-
</p>
<p>this position, it is found in the fact that the ! terdicted, by fundamental law, the establish-
</p>
<p>of rebellion are wanting in proportion to j ment of any order of nobility. Many of them
</p>
<p>' were sorely distressed at the contemplation of
</p>
<p>slavery on the other hand, in connection with
</p>
<p>its probable results upon the national welfare.
</p>
<p>Our calamity is but the fulfilment of their
</p>
<p>prophecies. They well knew the nature of the
</p>
<p>evil we have to deal with.
</p>
<p>It is matter of astonishment to most minds
</p>
<p>that slaveholders should have contemplated the
</p>
<p>bold venture of subordinating the Democratic
</p>
<p>principle in government. It will be less aston-
</p>
<p>ishing, however, when it is duly considered
</p>
<p>that it is utterly impossible for democracy and
</p>
<p>slavery to abide long together. The one or the
</p>
<p>other must, ere long, have been prostrated
</p>
<p>under the laws of population, and it is not
</p>
<p>very likely that the twenty-seven millions and
</p>
<p>their increase would consent to be subordinated

</p>
<p>resentation in Congress against the influences ruling political power, or it cannot long exist
</p>
<p>of surrounding treason. There is a cheering at all. This the slaveholders well knew ; hence
</p>
<p>satisfaction in the belief that this plateau of the necessity of fortifying itself through some

<p>believe that Kentucky or Maryland, without
</p>
<p>slavery, would have been less loyal than Ohio.
</p>
<p>In Eastern Kentucky, Western Virginia, East-
</p>
<p>ern Tennessee, Western North Carolina, a
</p>
<p>small portion of Georgia, and Northern Ala-
</p>
<p>bama, the Union cause finds a friend's country.
</p>
<p>These sections, in the main, contain a popula-
</p>
<p>tion dependent upon its own labor for subsist-
</p>
<p>ence. Schooled by diligent industry to habits
</p>
<p>of perseverance, and learning independence
</p>
<p>and manhood by relying on itself, it has pre-
</p>
<p>served its patriotism and attachment to the
</p>
<p>Government under which it was born. It saw
</p>
<p>no cause of complaint, imaginary or real. Six
</p>
<p>or seven per cent, of slave population has not
</p>
<p>proved sufficient as a slave interest, to prostrate
</p>
<p>or corrupt its national fidelity, nor to under-
</p>
<p>civil liberty and freedom, even unassisted
</p>
<p>could not have been permanently held in sub-
</p>
<p>jection by the myrmidons of rebellion. The
</p>
<p>secessionists themselves bestow a high com-
</p>
<p>pliment to the patriotism of v this people,
</p>
<p>when they complain of its "idolatrous attach-
</p>
<p>ment to the old government. "
</p>
<p>The time has come when the American
</p>
<p>people, from necessity, must analyze to their
</p>
<p>root the whole aptitudes and incidents of
</p>
<p>slavery. They are now obliged to deal with it,
</p>
<p>unbridled by the check-rein of its apologists.
</p>
<p>Under the best behavior of slaveholders, the
</p>
<p>institution could not rise above the point of
</p>
<p>bare toleration. There is so much inherent in
</p>
<p>political arrangement against the Democratic
</p>
<p>power of the masses.

</p>
<p>with the North, educationally, politically, and : little difficulty in determining the ultimatum in
</p>
<p>industrially. They were astute in the discov

<p>ery that under the operation of the Democratic

</p>
<p>The measurable acquiescence of the non-
</p>
<p>slaveholding population was indispensable to
</p>
<p>the revolutionary project. Without it, there
</p>
<p>was but little numerical force. It was, there-
</p>
<p>fore, of entire consequence to make this pop-
</p>
<p>ulation hate the North to hate the National
</p>
<p>Government, and to train it for the purposes of
</p>
<p>rebellion. The press was suborned wherever
</p>
<p>it could be. The pulpit manifested equal alac-
</p>
<p>rity, in order to keep pace with the workings
</p>
<p>of the virus of treason. Leading men, assum-
</p>
<p>ing to be statesmen and political economists,
</p>
<p>taxed their ingenuity in the invention of false-
</p>
<p>hood. The effort of the press and politicians
</p>
<p>was directed to misrepresenting and dispara-

</p>
<p>with their disparaged condition. It is needless
</p>
<p>to say, the work of imposition was too effectual-
</p>
<p>ly accompUshed. It must be confessed that
</p>
<p>too much of the non-slaveholding population
</p>
<p>had been induced to follow the political Iagos
</p>
<p>of the South, and thus to assist the first act in
</p>
<p>the plan for its own subversion  separation
</p>
<p>from the North. The next step in the plan of
</p>
<p>subversion, the ' ' abrogation of a government
</p>
<p>of majorities," was carefully kept from the
</p>
<p>public view.
</p>
<p>The inquiry naturally arises, as to how or
</p>
<p>why this design for the arrangement of political
</p>
<p>power in the Southern Confederacy has been
</p>
<p>confined within such narrow degrees of disclo-
</p>
<p>sure. The answer is plain. A bold proposition
</p>
<p>to change the principles of their government
</p>
<p>would have alarmed the people of the South
</p>
<p>into an intensified opposition. The politicians
</p>
<p>of South Carolina, more open and frank in the
</p>
<p>exposition of their views than other leaders in
</p>
<p>the South, have been obliged to submit the con-
</p>
<p>trol of their discretion to the more crafty and
</p>
<p>subtle influences of other States. Policy re-
</p>
<p>the designs of treason. He will have become
</p>
<p>convinced that it is nothing less than a warfare
</p>
<p>against the continuation of Democratic govern-
</p>
<p>ment in the South'  that this warfare is stimu-
</p>
<p>lated by the fixed belief that a government of
</p>
<p>majorities must be superseded, in order to per-
</p>
<p>petuate the institution of slavery.
</p>
<p>Were argument wanting to force this conclu-
</p>
<p>sion on the mind, it would be supplied in the
</p>
<p>established affinity between the emissary of
</p>
<p>secession in Europe and the virulent haters of
</p>
<p>AGAINST DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.
</p>
<p>spread sympathy expressed by the liberalists
</p>
<p>of Europe in the Union cause, elsewhere
</p>
<p>than in their attachment to liberalize institu-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>Having glanced at the compound motive for
</p>
<p>establishing the Southern Confederacy, that is,
</p>
<p>slavery perpetuation through prostration of the
</p>
<p>Democratic principle, it may not be amiss to
</p>
<p>refer to the contemplated management of its
</p>
<p>politico-economic interests. These were to be
</p>
<p>built up, of course ; but not through a system
</p>
<p>of diversified industry ; for free trade, as is well
</p>
<p>known, would have the effect to prostrate what
</p>
<p>little manufacturing had been commenced in
</p>
<p>the Southland afford a perpetual bar to the
</p>
<p>success of future undertakings. It was believed
</p>
<p>that the foul elements North and South, and
</p>
<p>the illicit traders of the world beside, could be
</p>
<p>brought together in the business of free trade
</p>
<p>and smuggling. The immense frontier would
</p>
<p>render it impossible for the Northern States to
</p>
<p>protect themselves to much extent from illicit
</p>
<p>trade through any preventive service possible
</p>
<p>to be adopted. The Mexican frontier would be
</p>
<p>entirely helpless. Thus reasoned Sccesh. This
</p>
<p>was to have been the basis of competition with
</p>
<p>Northern mechanism. The reasonings of the
</p>
<p>conspirators were consistent with the merits
</p>
<p>and morals of the conspiracy. They calculated
</p>
<p>upon the active co-operation of the mercenary
</p>
<p>in the North, and actually believed that the
</p>
<p>temptation to gain would prove predominant
</p>
<p>over any efforts the Northern Government could
</p>
<p>make to protect its revenue policy. They

</p>
<p>boldly ventured upon the assumption that the
</p>
<p>influence of illicit traffic would soon become too
</p>
<p>strong to be resisted, and that in this manner,
</p>
<p>in conjunction with the agency of ' King Cot-
</p>
<p>ton, ' the commerce of the North would be trans-
</p>
<p>ferred to the South.
</p>
<p>Another item in Southern political economy
</p>
<p>was the project of reopening the African slave-
</p>
<p>trade. The leaders of the secession programme
</p>
<p>had made this a prominent feature in starting
</p>
<p>the rebellion into growth. The various phases
</p>
<p>which this branch of the question afterward
</p>
<p>underwent, was owing to the opposition of the
</p>
<p>Border States. So much were the people of
</p>
<p>the Border States averse to being brought into
</p>
<p>competition with slave-breeding in Dahomey,
</p>
<p>that the original conspirators were obliged to
</p>
<p>forego, for a time at least, this incident in the
</p>
<p>motives of the earlier revolutionists.
</p>
<p>A government founded on the supremacy of
</p>
<p>a class, and that class to be composed of slave-
</p>
<p>holders ; a political economy founded on slave
</p>
<p>labor, free trade, illicit trade, and African kidnap-
</p>
<p>ping, were associations that would require great
</p>
<p>strength and influence to sustain them, The
</p>
<p>strongest military organization was therefore
</p>
<p>contemplated. In this, much employment
</p>
<p>could be given to the non-slaveholdiug masses,
</p>
<p>while military qualities of supposed superiority
</p>
<p>would enable the Southern Confederacy to en-
</p>
<p>ter into a successful contest with the North for
</p>
<p>empire. The potency of ' King Cotton ' was to
</p>
<p>be made the powerful agency with which the
</p>
<p>rest of the civilized world was to be dragooned
</p>
<p>into acquiescence, on this delusive dream was

<p>THE SLAVEHOLDERS CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>politically vitiated class who would be willing
</p>
<p>to overthrow the National Government, but
</p>
<p>who were supposed to be too few in numbers
</p>
<p>to taint with poisonous fatahty the pobtical
</p>
<p>mind of the South. It is not established as
</p>
<p>yet that the Southern political mind in the main
</p>
<p>has become depraved. It is, however, estab-
</p>
<p>lished, that the leading political influences
</p>
<p>South have cajoled and terrorized the bulk of
</p>
<p>the Southern population into apparent ac-
</p>
<p>quiescence in treason. It yet remains to
</p>
<p>be seen what despotism will be disclosed
</p>
<p>by the Southern people as soon as protec-
</p>
<p>tion is guaranteed to them against the
</p>
<p>tyranny and usurpations of the rebel influ-
</p>
<p>ence. It is prophesied that there will be
</p>
<p>found a heart in the bulk of the Southern
</p>
<p>population ; that it will still cling with affec-
</p>
<p>tion and pride to that government which was
</p>
<p>their guarantee, and which no power now on
</p>
<p>earth is competent to shake. It is not against
</p>
<p>the deluded, the timid, or the helpless of the
</p>
<p>South that we would make the indictment for
</p>
<p>political crime. It is the perfidious pro-
</p>
<p>slavery spirit in politics that we seek to ar-
</p>
<p>raign.
</p>
<p>The analysis of developed motives in which
</p>
<p>the slaveholders' rebellion had its origin, must
</p>
<p>naturally excite the inquiry in the American
</p>
<p>mind, as to how far the slaveholding element
</p>
<p>can be trusted. As a political force, we find it

<p>sowing the seeds of political discontent. As

<p>the overthrow of democratic government. In
</p>
<p>its efforts to denationalize republican govern-
</p>
<p>ment in America, it has not scrupled to seek
</p>
<p>aid from, and alliance with, the haters of re-
</p>
<p>publican institutions everywhere. Under such
</p>
<p>calamitous teachings as it has inflicted can we
</p>
<p>longer conclude that it can, from its aptitudes
</p>
<p>and nature, be converted into an element of

<p>national strength? There is a South, and a
</p>
<p>great South, and would continue to be, were
</p>
<p>there not a negro or slaveholder sojourning

<p>there. The seven millions non- slaveholding

<p>population in the Southern States have rights,
</p>
<p>social and political, based on the motive to
</p>
<p>maintain republican government. The Con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the Union, as the highest principle

<p>of fundamental law, guarantees in express

</p>
<p>This slight exhibition in. the Carolina Legis-
</p>
<p>lature presents an epitome of the whole argu^
</p>
<p>ment of cultivated brutality on the one hand,
</p>
<p>and of human sense and rationality on the
</p>
<p>other. What were the protection and sense of
</p>
<p>justice here spoken of ; and what the sequences
</p>
<p>flowing from such protection and justice ? The
</p>
<p>whole question is answered in three words :
</p>
<p>Improvement, following encouragement. What
</p>
<p>was the ' robbery* proposed by the bill, other
</p>
<p>than the concomitants of slavery, that have
</p>
<p>robbed the colored man from generation to gen-
</p>
<p>eration, not only of his toil, but of every prac-
</p>
<p>tical motive to be a man? It would be need-
</p>
<p>less, however, to discuss the question of the
</p>
<p>colored man's rapacity to improve, were it not
</p>
<p>for considerations that now make it neces-
</p>
<p>sary, under national calamity, to take into
</p>
<p>truthful account. The white man's cultivation
</p>
<p>of barbarity under the teachings of slaveholders
</p>
<p>has hitherto proved an overmatch for the color-
</p>
<p>ed man's claims in the abstract. Things and

<p>conditions are now changed. The slaveholders'

<p>in politics is now discovered to be little short of
</p>
<p>a demon  a snake's egg that hatches treason.
</p>
<p>The American mind is nearly forced to the
</p>
<p>conclusion, that as long as colored women are
</p>
<p>compelled to breed slaves their white mistresses
</p>
<p>will continue to breed rebels. Slavery, of
</p>
<p>course, must yield to the necessity of national
</p>
<p>security. A remnant may exist for a while,
</p>
<p>and linger through modifications of a broken
</p>
<p>and helpless pro-slavery prestige, the duration
</p>
<p>depending entirely upon the disposition of
</p>
<p>slaveholders to become subordinated to law.
</p>
<p>Perpetuation, however, has become a word
</p>
<p>that has no meaning in connection with the
</p>
<p>duration of slavery. The word in that sense
</p>
<p>has become obsolete ; and what shall become
</p>
<p>of the colored man, and how shall he be treated
</p>
<p>is, and is to be, the sequence of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>to overthrow the jurisdiction of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. It being established that the pro-slavery
</p>
<p>spirit by nature, is the antagonist of the demo-
</p>
<p>cratic principle  the antagonist of the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of the masses, the hot-bed for the cultiva-
</p>
<p>tion of brutality, devoid of fidelity, and a rebel
</p>
<p>by practice, it has become an intolerable ele-
</p>
<p>ment of national weakness. We cannot avoid
</p>
<p>the inquiry, now to be made on the basis of hu-
</p>
<p>manity : Can the colored man, by proper and
</p>
<p>just encouragement, be converted into an ele-
</p>
<p>ment of patriotism and national strength ?
</p>
<p>* The free colored population of Charleston, in I860, did
</p>
<p>aot var,y materially from lour thousand. Th.; .
</p>
<p>valae of their property would givo to each $390. Each
</p>
<p>family of six persons would possess, according to this
</p>
<p>estimate, $2,340. This would be a full averago of wealth

</p>
<p>THE SLAVEHOLDERS CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>The brutal ruffianism of the pro-slavery spirit
</p>
<p>has far enough disclosed its natural aptitudes
</p>
<p>to have become disgustingly odious in compari-
</p>
<p>son with the positively better characteristics of
</p>
<p>the colored man. The rebel himself has
</p>
<p>taught a lesson to the world, which he can
</p>
<p>never unteach. The twenty-seven millions of
</p>
<p>free labor in the Union have learned a lesson
</p>
<p>through the teachings of slaveholders in rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, which they can not forget. This teaching
</p>
<p>is nothing less than that the colored man is
</p>
<p>capable, by protection and encouragement, of
</p>
<p>being converted into a better element of na-
</p>
<p>tional strength and national prosperity than
</p>
<p>slaveholders, as such, would ever become.
</p>
<p>Could any contemplative mind doubt for a
</p>
<p>moment the ability of the white population of
</p>
<p>the Union, if justly disposed, to raise the col-
</p>
<p>ored population of the country, in a short time,
</p>
<p>to the platform of a decent respectability?
</p>
<p>With unjust prejudice laid aside, and the work
</p>
<p>of beneficence acquiesced in, no one coidd rea-
</p>
<p>sonably doubt it. Who deserves best at the
</p>
<p>hands of the nation's power, the oppressor or
</p>
<p>the oppressed? The one that grasps at the
</p>
<p>throat of the nation and attempts its overthrow
</p>
<p>merely to perpetuate his power of oppression,
</p>
<p>or the other who is crying to humanity for pro-
</p>
<p>tection ? The voice of nature, if undefiled, will
</p>
<p>answer this question on the side of humanity 
</p>
<p>if not, NECESSITY WILL.

</p>

<p>to the resistance of a single despot. It goes in
</p>
<p>the same degree to a privileged class that arro-
</p>
<p>gates to itself the right to oppress ; nor does it
</p>
<p>stop at the halfway house of mere negative pro-
</p>
<p>tection. It allows in its onward course the full
</p>
<p>fruition of ' equality before the law. ' In the-
</p>
<p>ory, the law is the sovereign, and we seek to
</p>
<p>attach such qualities to that sovereign as are
</p>
<p>compatible with the general good of society.
</p>
<p>That theory places no man above the law, nor
</p>
<p>any man below its protection. As soon as the
</p>
<p>individual in society is raised to the point of
</p>
<p>negative protection, he is in a measure con-
</p>
<p>verted into a being of power. He can then ap-
</p>
<p>peal to his sovereign, the law, for the vindica-
</p>
<p>tion of his rights. Experience is continually
</p>
<p>demonstrating that men are respected in pro-
</p>
<p>portion to their power to command respect.
</p>
<p>The very existence of slavery requires and de-
</p>
<p>mands the brutalization of the governing power
</p>
<p>that upholds it. Were society absolved from
</p>
<p>this tyranny, matters would begin to mend.
</p>
<p>Equalized protection would be the consequence.
</p>
<p>Protection, not only to the colored man, but
</p>
<p>protection in an almost equal degree to the non-
</p>
<p>slaveholding white population, hitherto brought
</p>
<p>under the ban of disability by a depressing pro-
</p>
<p>slavery policy.
</p>
<p>Until recently, when the colored race in the
</p>
<p>United States was spoken of in connection with
</p>
<p>the subject of its release from oppression, it was
</p>
<p>subjected to the same arguments that kept the
</p>
<p>white men in slavery in olden times. The argu-
</p>
<p>ments of slaveholders were never truthful, and
</p>
<p>only convenient for themselves. They damaged
</p>
<p>AGAINST DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>rights have been forfeited ? Who dare deny the
</p>
<p>right of the colored man morally, religiously,
</p>
<p>or politically, to assert them ? It is true, we
</p>
<p>have hitherto acted in defiance of these ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged rights. "We have outraged them.
</p>
<p>We have waged a shameful and shameless war-
</p>
<p>fare against them. The sequences of that war-
</p>
<p>fare are now upon us. The sin is now being
</p>
<p>atoned for in blood. It has not yet been or-
</p>
<p>dained that the principles of injustice should
</p>
<p>have permanent duration. If not restrained by
</p>
<p>humane rationality, they will culminate in con-
</p>
<p>vulsion. The light is now breaking upon the
</p>
<p>heretofore obscured vision of the American
</p>
<p>people. We can now begin to see with clear-
</p>
<p>ness that the colored man's disenthralment is
</p>
<p>to become the white man's future security,
</p>
<p>This would almost seem to be the harmony of
</p>
<p>divine justice in the affairs of men.
</p>
<p>No substantial amelioration in the depressed
</p>
<p>condition of race or class has yet been brought
</p>
<p>about in disconnection with the powerful
</p>
<p>agency of such race or class. Human nature
</p>
<p>forbids it. The selfish tenacity of advantage,
</p>
<p>resting on what is misnamed ' vested rights, '
</p>
<p>but having its foundation in vested wrongs,
</p>
<p>yields only on compulsion. It is only when
</p>
<p>the depressed race or class, acting in somewhat
</p>
<p>intelligent concert, exhibits the disposition to
</p>
<p>aid in the purposes of protection, that the
</p>
<p>mercenary power succumbs to necessity. His-
</p>
<p>tory furnishes no example to the contrary. It
</p>
<p>may not be impossible that our own times

</p>
<p>may make history to corroborate the truth of
</p>
<p>these premises.
</p>
<p>When it is asserted that the colored man is
</p>
<p>wanting in bravery, and is not endowed with
</p>
<p>the natural courage to assert and maintain his
</p>
<p>his rights, we are apt to forget that physical
</p>
<p>bravery is a thing of cultivation. There is not
</p>
<p>the least evidence that, with military discipline
</p>
<p>and something to fight for, the colored popula-
</p>
<p>tion of the United States would not prove as
</p>
<p>brave as the black regiment of the Revolution.
</p>
<p>With such bravery as that regiment exhibited,
</p>
<p>the four millions and their prospective increase
</p>
<p>would require a gigantic force to make profit-
</p>
<p>able slaves of them. Again, there is something
</p>
<p>beyond the protection from domestic violence
</p>
<p>that demands consideration, in connection with
</p>
<p>the military discipline of the colored man. We
</p>
<p>may reasonably expect that a large colonization
</p>
<p>in some quarter will soon take place, and be
</p>
<p>carried forward. Education and military dis-
</p>
<p>cipline, in addition to knowledge in practical
</p>
<p>industry, are necessary concomitants to suc-
</p>
<p>cessful colonization. With these qualities, the
</p>
<p>colored man will cease to feel helpless, and be
</p>
<p>fitted for enterprise. He will have the confi-
</p>
<p>dence to go forward, and the aspirations to im-
</p>
<p>pel him. It may be the lot of the colored man
</p>
<p>to encounter in some foreign land, powers and
</p>
<p>influences quite as barbarous as those he has
</p>
<p>hitherto encountered in the white man's pre-
</p>
<p>judices. If he is armed for the encounter, he
</p>
<p>will have little inclination to shrink from it.
</p>
<p>Every humane consideration clusters to the
</p>
<p>policy of disenthralling the colored man, and

</p>
<p>Such are the opinions of General Grant-^a man whom even the Copperheads will not
</p>
<p>charge with " fanaticism," inasmuch as he, like Holt, Hamilton, Dix, Butler, and others of
</p>
<p>the most prominent loyalists, was a Democrat of the straitest sort till this Rebellion (at

<p>least temporarily) erased all other distinctions except friends and enemies of our National

<p>Genera] Hooker said :

<p>" We have not even yet put forward all our energies and resources, although we have
</p>
<p>shown, and we have employed, resources which have amazed the world. But in the North,
</p>
<p>the North has not yet made that one great effort to crush this revolt by a blow ; it could
</p>
<p>do it, and can do it, any day when it moves for that purpose. (Cheers.) The people in
</p>
<p>these loyal States  and I am proud to say it  the people have been in advance of the
</p>
<p>authorities in all of this rebellion (cheers), and they will be until they reach the end, and the
</p>
<p>end is not remote. (Cheers.) I am rejoiced to meet you, and to meet you under such auspices
</p>
<p>as I do to-night. Tidings  glorious tidings  reach us from all of the armies ; the work
</p>
<p>goes bravely on. There are NO COPPERHEADS (great cheers) there are NO COP-
</p>
<p>PERHEADS IN THE ARMY. (Cheers.) They will fight well, and they will vote well.

<p>" This is, indeed, a war for the maintenance of the constitution and the laws  nay, for

<p>motives and intentions, persistently repeated, they have arrayed against us our fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens, bound to us by the triple ties of consanguinity, geographical position, and com-
</p>
<p>mercial interest.
</p>
<p>" Let no man among us be base enough to forget this, or fool enough to trust an oligarchy
</p>
<p>of traitors to their friends, to civil liberty, and human freedom. Voluntary exiles from
</p>
<p>home and friends, for the defence and safety of all, we long for the time when gentle peace
</p>
<p>shall again spread her wings over our land ; but we know no such blessing is possible while
</p>
<p>the unjust and arbitrary power of rebel leaders confronts and threatens us. Crafty as the
</p>
<p>fox, cruel as the tiger, they cried ' no coercion,' while preparing to strike us. Bully-like,
</p>
<p>they proposed to fight us, because they said they could whip us five to one ; and now, when
</p>
<p>driven back, they whine out 'no invasion,' and promise us of the West permission to navi-
</p>
<p>gate the Mississippi, if we will be ' good boys,' and do as they bid us.
</p>
<p>" Whenever they have the power, they drive before them into their ranks the Southern
</p>
<p>people, and they would drive us. Trust them not. Were they able, they would invade
</p>
<p>and destroy us without mercy. Absolutely assured of these things, I am amazed that any
</p>
<p>one could think of ' peace on any terms.' He who entertains the sentiment is only fit to
</p>
<p>be a slave ; he who writes it at this time is, moreover, a traitor to his country, who deserves
</p>
<p>the scorn and contempt of all honorable men. When the power of the unscrupulous rebel
</p>
<p>leaders is removed, and the people are free to consider and act for their own interests,
</p>
<p>which are common with ours, under this government, there will be no great difficulty in

</p>
<p>DOUGLAS AND DICKINSON,
</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS OF JACKSONIAN TIMES BELIEVING IN THE DOC-
</p>
<p>TRINE OF OLD HICKORY, "THAT THE UNION MUST

<p>AND SHALL BE PRESERVED."
</p>
<p>DOUGLAS AND HIS DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS.
</p>
<p>Nothing in the political history of the times was more cheering to all loyal men than the
</p>
<p>frankness and promptness with which Senator Douglas broke through all partisan distinc-
</p>
<p>tions in proffering a hearty support to his successful competitor Lincoln, when the Rebellion
</p>
<p>first raised its assassin-like arm against the National Government. This practical example is
</p>
<p>worth a volume of comments on the patriotism of Douglas and his confidence in the in-
</p>
<p>tegrity of President Lincoln ; and it is creditable alike to themselves and to their country
</p>
<p>that so many of the Democratic friends of Douglas, like Grant. Dix, Dickinson, and others,
</p>
<p>have so cordially united with former opponents in giving " a long pull, a strong pull, and a
</p>
<p>pull all together," in defence of the National Union.
</p>
<p>DICKINSON UPON REBELLION-" AM I FOR PEACE ?"-YES !
</p>
<p>The reply of Daniel S. Dickinson to a person who wrote inquiring " if he was for
</p>
<p>peace," is just what might be expected from that thorough-going Democrat, and is worthy
</p>
<p>of repetition everywhere through the land, as a general answer to the Copperhead slang-
</p>
<p>whanging about " armistices," and " peace-upon-any-terms" with the Slaveholding Traitors.
</p>
<p>" AM I FOR PEACE ?" YES !
</p>
<p>For the peace which rings out from the cannon's throat,
</p>
<p>And the suasion of shot and shell,
</p>
<p>Till Rebellion's spirit is trampled down
</p>
<p>To the depths of its kindred hell 
</p>
<p>For the peace which shall follow the squadron's tramp,
</p>
<p>Where the brazen trumpets bray,
</p>
<p>And, drunk with the fury of storm and strife,
</p>
<p>The blood-red chargers neigh 
</p>
<p>For the peace that shall wash out the leprous stain
</p>
<p>Of our slavery  foul and grim 
</p>
