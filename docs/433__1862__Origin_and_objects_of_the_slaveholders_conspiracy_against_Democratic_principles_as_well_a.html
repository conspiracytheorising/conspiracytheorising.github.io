</p>
<p>ANTAGONISTIC PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN THE REBELLION-THE
</p>
<p>SLAVE ARISTOCRACY against THE DEMOCRACY.
</p>
<p>The commentaries on the recent speeches of Col. Hamilton, of Texas, by several prominent New York journslists. furnish appropriate introduction to the outlines of those speeches which are herewith presented for the oonsideration of loyal men of all pr:rties throughout the land.
</p>
<p>It will be seen that, much as they may differ in other respects, T/he World & Caourier[& Enquirer, the Tribne,
</p>
<p>the'limes, and the Eveningy Post, concur in ranking those speeches among the most important ever made in connecti, n with the ojigin and objects of the Slavtholders' Rebellion.
</p>
<p>On some points, indeed, the revelations of Col. Hamilton are considered as the most valuable-inasmuch as
</p>
<p>they show, by the highest Southern testimony, the breadth, depth, and blackness of that conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>indivil ual rights of the Democratic masscs, as well as against tile integrity of the National Union.
</p>
<p>The Northern People have accepted this war on too ntlrrow grounds altogether," says The World & Courier
</p>
<p>& Enquirer:-" They have comprehended but a very meagre portion of the real interests at stake-for the very
</p>
<p>good reason that they have hardly begun to understand the spirit and aims of the Rebel leaders. Had there been a
</p>
<p>better appreciation of the actual truth, the war would never have lagged as it has been suffered to do from the
</p>
<p>begi!;, ing."
</p>
<p>" The evidence of such men as Col. Hamilton, who is fresh from the active scenes of the Rebellion, and who has
</p>
<p>watched it with penetrating eye from its first step, is of peculiar value," says the World in its daily issue of the 4th
</p>
<p>of October. "Their conclusions, formed on the spot, face to face with the monster, are of infinitely more weight than
</p>
<p>the noqions of Northern men, who know it only by occasional glimpses in the far distance. It is well that their testimony should be brought before cur public whenever it can be obtained. The gentlemen who have induced Col.
</p>
<p>Hamilton to address our people with instruction and appeal, have done the good cause precious service." * * *
</p>
<p>"Col. Hamilton has no hesitation in pronouncing the issue now pending to lie THE VERY HIGHEST, AND BROADEST,
</p>
<p>AND DEEPEST possible. It is, to his mind, nothing more nor less than A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ULTIMATE PREINC(PLES OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT-a question whether the tile qof the few or the rdule qof te mnany shall prevail. ITe
</p>
<p>presents it as his settled conviction that the leaders in this Rebellion are actuated by a distinct purpose to SUPPLANT POPULAR GOVERN5IMENT and ESTABLISH A MO:iARI'CHY and that this comes from their belief
</p>
<p>that Slavery can. have no e 2ect.tal s(tfegqtard ercelt what thi.e strongestjbsm of government can aafo,-d. Therefore, he warns us not to rest upon the idea that mere territory, or even mere nationality, is at stake in' this conflict."
</p>
<p>"What has really got to be decided, as he justly views it," adds the TWorld, "is, not whether the flag itself shall

<p>would only be anbother nasne for perpetcual war.
</p>
<p>"We are, therefre, shut up to the absolute necessity of meetin, this question now, once for all," continnes the
</p>
<p>World " and, in fidelity to the great principles of th.- Declaration of Inderpendence which our forefathers sealed

</p>
<p>pervaded by a sense of their awfal moment-and no mind that heeds his disclosures and his arguments, can doubt
</p>
<p>that he is right."
</p>
<p>Profoundly impressed with the snmne views that CoL. Hamilton has now forcibly illustrated by his speeches in
</p>
<p>New York and Brooklyn, the DEM]IOCRATIC LEAGUE FOR SUSTAINItNG TIlE NATIONAL UNITY has earnestly labored for
</p>
<p>several months in disseminating documents replete with facts and argdments on the important topics. And some
</p>
<p>of those important documents are now republished in connection with the speeches of Col. Hamilton. as showing
</p>
<p>the identity of views between the Colonel and that Lengue-one of whose most efficient memb:rs.(Lorenzo Sherwoodl) was a resident and a legislator in Texas, and a co-worker with Col. Hamilton in sustaining the National
</p>
<p>Government in Texas, till its flag and its forces were betrayed by the General (Twiggs) whom the then War Seeretary Floyd placed in command as an emissary of Rebellion.
</p>
<p>As the importance of the topics cannot be over-estimated, it is hoped that men of all parties will thoroughly
</p>
<p>examine these and other publicqtions calculated to place the origin and objects of the Slaveholders' Conspiracy in
</p>
<p>their true light-as an attempted revolution not o!ly in the Union of the States, but in the relaiions of the Democratic
</p>
<p>masses to the government of their country-that each man may act and vote as becomes an American citizen, in
</p>
<p>view of the fact which Col. Hamilton concurs with the Democratic League in asserting, that " the leaders in this
</p>
<p>"Rebellion are actuated by a distinct purpose to supplant popular government and establish a monarchy; and that'this comes from their belief that Slavery can have no effectual safeguard except what the strongest government
</p>
<p>"can afford;" or, as Mr. G:irnett, of Virginia, in his letter to Trescott (Mr. Buchanan's Assistant Secretary of State),
</p>
<p>expresses it, when "objecting to the term Democrat," because, as slaveholders declared, "'Democracy. in its
</p>
<p>original philosophical sense, is, indeed, ineompatible with S'la 3ry and the whole system of S'outlhern Socsey."

<p>The Slaveholders' Denunciations against Democracy.
</p>
<p>Garnett's letter to Trescott, published on the 10th page, is one of the clearest revelations
</p>
<p>of the purposes of the Slaveholders in this Rebellion.''lhat Mr. Trescott was a thorough sympathizer with the Virginian Slaveholder in denouncing Democratic principles, is indicated in various ways, even in his Address before the
</p>
<p>South Carolina Historical Society, as published in the Charleston Mercury, and re-published
</p>
<p>in De Bow's Review for December, 1859, wherein he says:
</p>
<p>"That the institution [of Slavery], which, with the men of former times, was an experi" ment, had become the corner-stone of their social and political life:"
</p>
<p>And yet there were some men in South Carolina "who would eradicate our old State
</p>
<p>" pride-destroy the conservative character of our State politics-strip us bare of the glorious
</p>
<p>" achievements of the past, and drive us, destitute and dishonored, into the fit companionship
</p>
<p>"of a vagabond and demoralized Democracy."
</p>
<p> And all this denunciation of " Democracy," while Trescott was actually serving as Mr.
</p>
<p>Buchanan's "Democratic" Assistant Secretary of State-plotting the ruin of our Democratio
</p>
<p>institutions, because " Slavery is incompatible with Democraoy."

<p>(POSTSCRIPT TO THE SECOND EDITION.)
</p>
<p>From the New York Tribune, Oct. 21.
</p>
<p>The "Origin and Objects of the Slaveholders' Conspiracy against Democratic Principles, as
</p>
<p>well as against the National Union," illustrated in the Speeches of ANDREW JACKSON HAMILTON, of
</p>
<p>Texas, the statements of LoRENzo SHERWOOD, late of Texas; the letter of MUSCOE R. H. GARNETT, late
</p>
<p>Democratic Member of Congress from Virginia, to William H. Trescott, of South Carolina, showing
</p>
<p>the antagonism of Democracy and Free Labor to Slavery and its Rebellion; the Letter of the
</p>
<p>Democratic League of our City to John Bright, &c., has just been compiled for that League by
</p>
<p>HENRY O'RIELLY, and is now printed in a neat pamphlet, which can be had at our office. If there
</p>
<p>is a sincere and loyal Democrat in this State, who now thinks of voting for Seymour & Co., we
</p>
<p>are confident that a careful reading of this pamphlet would dissuade him from so doing. Please
