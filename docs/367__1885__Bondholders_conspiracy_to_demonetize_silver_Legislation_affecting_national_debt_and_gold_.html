<p>WAE ON SILVEE.
</p>
<p>The silver question is a contest between European bond-
</p>
<p>holders and the laborers of the world. The National Banks
</p>
<p>of the United States are the allies of European bondhold-
</p>
<p>ers. While the demonetization of silver would necessarily
</p>
<p>destroy silver mining, that fact is of little consequence com-
</p>
<p>pared with the disastrous efifect it would have upon society.
</p>
<p>It would destroy the confidence of the masses in the good
</p>
<p>faith of their rulers. Nihilists, socialists, communists and
</p>
<p>other disturbers of the public peace are powerless SQ
</p>
<p>long as the people believe substantial justice will be admin*
</p>
<p>istered under the present systems of government.
</p>
<p>The proposal to demonetize silver is in violation of exist*
</p>
<p>ing contracts for the payment of money. It emanates from
</p>
<p>a bondholding directory in Europe, and its purpose is tc
</p>
<p>enhance the value of all obligations for the payment ot
</p>
<p>money.
</p>
<p>To appreciate the designs of the bondholders, and to un-
</p>
<p>derstand their motives in this war upon silver, it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary to consider the bonded debt which they control.
</p>
<p>The national debts of the world aggregate over $26,000,-
</p>
<p>00,000, all of which is substantially controlled by a small
</p>
<p>European syndicate. If we exclude India, China and Japan,
</p>
<p>with a population of about 662,000,000 and a debt of about
</p>
<p>$1,100,000,000, the national debts of the remaining civilized
</p>
<p>countries are, in round numbers, $25,000,000,000, and the
</p>
<p>other indebtedness of the same countries is estimated to be
</p>
<p>several times the amount of the national debts. But if we
</p>
<p>assume that all other bonded obligations are only equal to
</p>
<p>double that amount, we have a total of $75,000,000,000.
</p>
<p>The nations owing this debt have a population of 488,000, -

</p>
<p>000, about 38,000,000 of whom are not sufficiently civilized
</p>
<p>to pay taxes. Of the remaining 450,000,000, not more than
</p>
<p>one in four is a producer; that is to say, only 112,500,000
</p>
<p>are productive laborers. This one-quarter must therefore
</p>
<p>not only support the other three-quarters, and supply
</p>
<p>armies and navies (for purposes hereafter noticed), but it
</p>
<p>must pay an annual interest of at least four per cent, on
</p>
<p>$75,000,000,000. If the duration of a generation is assumed
</p>
<p>to be thirty-four years (which is according to recent esti-
</p>
<p>mates), the enormous sum of $102,000,000,000 must be paid
</p>
<p>by each generation for interest alone. If nothing but gold
</p>
<p>will satisfy this demand, who can estimate the days or hours
</p>
<p>of toil requisite to procure it? If, in addition to this, the
</p>
<p>debts of the world continue to increase in the future  which
</p>
<p>is most probable in view of the fact that during the present
</p>
<p>century they have increased more than 300 per cent.  the
</p>
<p>burden of the producer must be correspondingly increased.
</p>
<p>All countries, however, are not equally involved. The
</p>
<p>United States, with greater resources than any other coun-
</p>
<p>try, owes comparatively a small debt. Based upon the
</p>
<p>foregoing ratio of debt to population, a producer in this
</p>
<p>country would probably be required to pay only about $500
</p>
<p>on interest account in a generation of thirty-four years, if
</p>
<p>our bonded debts  national and corporate  should remain
</p>
<p>what they now are, without increase or diminution. But it
</p>
<p>is to be hoped that our national debt will soon be paid, and
</p>
<p>the people of the United States liberated from its depress-
</p>
<p>ing influence. In Europe, however, the situation is differ-
</p>
<p>ent. For example: In France each individual producer (on
</p>
<p>the assumption that thirty-four years is the period of a gen-
</p>
<p>eration), must pay on interest account alone more than $2000,
</p>
<p>with no prospect of relief.
</p>
<p>CONDITION OF THE DEBTOR.
</p>
<p>A contract of indebtedness is an undertaking on the

</p>
<p>part of the debtor to deliver at a future time to the creditor
</p>
<p>a certain amount of property or money named in an obliga-
</p>
<p>tion. The condition of the debtor owing money is precisely
</p>
<p>analogous to that of a person who agrees to deliver wheat,
</p>
<p>corn, cotton, or other farm product, at a future time, or after
</p>
<p>the same shall have been harvested. If his crop is good,
</p>
<p>the seller can deliver the article required at the designated
</p>
<p>time; but if his crop fails, it may become difficult or even
</p>
<p>impossible for him to comply with his contract. His con-
</p>
<p>dition is also like that of a person who sells stock " short."
</p>
<p>That is, he agrees to deliver at a future time a certain num-
</p>
<p>ber of shares which he does not then possess. If, when the
</p>
<p>time for delivery arrives stock is plenty, the contract can
</p>
<p>be easily performed; but if the stock has been "pooled," or
</p>
<p>by any other means taken out of the market, compliance may
</p>
<p>be* impossible.
</p>
<p>BONDED DEBT PAYABLE IN GOLD OK SILVER.
</p>
<p>The 175,000,000,000 bonded debt was, at the time it was
</p>
<p>contracted, an agreement on the part of the debtor to de-
</p>
<p>liver to the creditor at the various times named in the sev-
</p>
<p>eral contracts, either gold or silver, at the option of the
</p>
<p>debtor. If silver is to be withdrawn from the money of the
</p>
<p>world so that it cannot be delivered by the debtor in dis-
</p>
<p>charge of his obligation, the contract will be changed and
</p>
<p>the debtor injured. Money will be scarce  there will be a
</p>
<p>failure in the crop of coin; in other words, demonetization
</p>
<p>of silver means a "corner" in money.
</p>
<p>AMOUNT OF COIN IN CIECULATION AN ELEMENT IN ALL CONTRACTS .
</p>
<p>The amount of silver coin in the world when the war on
</p>
<p>silver commenced is supposed to have been about equal to
</p>
<p>the amount of gold coin. All contracts were made with re-
</p>
<p>ference to the amount of coin in circulation, relying on the
</p>
<p>probable production of the mines to keep good the world's
</p>
<p>stock of money. If the mines of either metal are more pro-
</p>

</p>
<p>ductive than usual, the debtor is benefited, and the creditor
</p>
<p>has no reason to complain, for that contingency entered
</p>
<p>into the contract. Nor can the debtor complain if the
</p>
<p>mines cease to produce, for he contracted to deliver coin,
</p>
<p>and made no condition relieving him of his contract in con-
</p>
<p>Bequence of scarcity of coin resulting from natural causes.
</p>
<p>So long as the option of the debtor to pay in either gold or
</p>
<p>silver remains, and the units of money are unchanged, the
</p>
<p>obligation of the contract is not violated. It is true when
</p>
<p>both gold and silver are used as money, the amount of coin
</p>
<p>in the world as compared with wealth and population fluctu-
</p>
<p>ates, and the value of money changes. This cannot be
</p>
<p>remedied until some device shall be adopted by govern-
</p>
<p>mental action, whereby the number of units of money shall
</p>
<p>bear a fixed relation to the wealth and population of the
</p>
<p>country in which such money is circulated.
</p>
<p>UPON WHAT THE TALUE OF MONEY DEPENDS.
</p>
<p>The value of a unit of money in any country must depend
</p>
<p>upon the number of such units in circulation as compared
</p>
<p>with wealth and population, and not upon the material of
</p>
<p>which the money is manufactured. The ratio between the
</p>
<p>wealth and population of most countries is practically a fixed
</p>
<p>ratio; in other words, the increase or decrease of the pop-
</p>
<p>ulation will substantially indicate the increase or decrease
</p>
<p>of the aggregate wealth of a nation. If, therefore, the ratio
</p>
<p>of units of money to the number of inhabitants of a country
</p>
<p>remains the same, it will preserve a fixed ratio of money to
</p>
<p>both wealth and population. A monetary system, therefore,
</p>
<p>regulated as to the number of units in circulation by the
</p>
<p>Dumber of inhabitants of the country in which such money
</p>
<p>IS circulated, will approximate as nearly as practicable to a
</p>
<p>perfect system. It matters not what number of units of
</p>
<p>money per capita exists in any country, provided that the
</p>
<p>ratio of population to such units is constantly maintained.
</p>
<p>When that ratio is changed by a diminution of the quantity

</p>
<p>of money we call it contraction; and when the ratio is dis-
</p>
<p>turbed by abundance of money it is called inflation.
</p>
<p>BI-METALLIC MONEY PREVENTS VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE
</p>
<p>VALUE OF MONEY.
</p>
<p>Our objection to the demonetization of silver is that it
</p>
<p>involves violent and continuous contraction. The use of the
</p>
<p>two metals (as we have already seen) does not furnish a per-
</p>
<p>fect monetary system. It does not altogether avoid the
</p>
<p>evils of expansion and contraction, but does have a tend-
</p>
<p>ency to prevent violent fluctuations in the value of money.
</p>
<p>Over-production of one metal is generally offset by a failure
</p>
<p>of production of the other. Although the two metals do not
</p>
<p>serve the highest ideal purpose of money by furnishing the
</p>
<p>exact amount necessary to maintain at all times the same
</p>
<p>relation numerically to population  and thereby afford an
</p>
<p>invariable rule with which to measure values and adjust
</p>
<p>contracts  yet they approximate more nearly to such ideal
</p>
<p>standard than either metal alone could possibly do. It is,
</p>
<p>therefore, not only dishonest but inexpedient to dispense
</p>
<p>with the use of either metal until a more certain standard
</p>
<p>than metallic money by which to measure values and adjust
</p>
<p>contracts can be devised.
</p>
<p>SHAM PRETENSES OF BONDHOLDERS.
</p>
<p>The various excuses put forth by the bondholders for the
</p>
<p>demonetization of silver are insulting to the understanding
</p>
<p>of mankind. They say they prefer gold because it is more
</p>
<p>convenient than silver. They might as well tell us that they
</p>
<p>prefer platinum because it is more convenient than gold. It
</p>
<p>is not a question of convenience  it is a question of common
</p>
<p>honesty. The object of demonetizing silver cannot be con-
</p>
<p>cealed by such sham pretenses  it is to enhance the value
</p>
<p>of securities.

</p>
<p>of the bondholders commenced more than thirty years ago.
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>Exaggerated reports from the gold fields of California and
</p>
<p>Australia brought forth appeals from Chevalier and other
</p>
<p>representatives of European bondholders for the demonetiza-
</p>
<p>tion of gold, with the avowed purpose of increasing the value
</p>
<p>of bonds. Germany and Austria, in 1857, actually demone-
</p>
<p>tized gold in the interest of the bondholders. France fa-
</p>
<p>vored the demonetization of one of the precious metals, but
</p>
<p>seemed to think it was best to demonetize silver and con-
</p>
<p>tract the world's money to a gold standard. After years of
</p>
<p>discussion the French Monetary Commission of 1869 came
</p>
<p>to the following conclusion :
</p>
<p>"As Governments control the weight and standard of
</p>
<p>money, they ought, so far as possible, to assure its value.
</p>
<p>And as it is admitted that the tendency of the metals is to
</p>
<p>depreciate, this tendency should be arrested by demonetiz-
</p>
<p>ing one of them."
</p>
<p>The only reason assigned by Chevalier, the Monetary Com-
</p>
<p>mission of France, and other representatives of the bond-
</p>
<p>holders, for the demonetization of one of the metals was the
</p>
<p>-appreciation of the value of bonds. They did not pretend
</p>
<p>that the people at large would be benefited by the demone-
</p>
<p>tization of either metal, but boldly declared that it would
</p>
<p>increase the value of bonds, and that such was their pur-
</p>
<p>pose.
</p>
<p>WAR FOR CONTRACTION CONCENTRATED ON THE DEMONETIZATION
</p>
<p>OF SILVER.
</p>
<p>The discussions in monetary commissions and financial
</p>
<p>circles as to the propriety of demonetizing one of the precious
</p>
<p>metals in the interest of the bondholders continued from time
</p>
<p>to time until 1871. About that time exaggerated rumors in
</p>
<p>regard to the fabulous amount of silver which would be pro-
</p>
<p>duced from the Comstock obtained circulation. Germany,
</p>
<p>not having succeeded in obtaining an international agree-

</p>
<p>ment to demonetize gold, seized upon these rumors as a
</p>
<p>pretext and demonetized silver. The United States, by the
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>Acts of 1873 and 1874 (hereafter noticed), did the same.
</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway in 1874, followed the bad example of
</p>
<p>Germany and the United States. France, Belgium, Switzer-
</p>
<p>land and Italy in the same year so limited the coinage of
</p>
<p>silver as to practically demonetize it. In 1875 Holland
</p>
<p>closed her mints against the coinage of silver on private
</p>
<p>account. In the same year Switzerland refused to coin sil-
</p>
<p>ver. In 1876, the President of the French Republic, under
</p>
<p>a law authorizing him to do so, suspended the coinage of
</p>
<p>silver. In the same year, Spain closed her mints against
</p>
<p>depositors of silver. Since that time no European nation
</p>
<p>has shown the least disposition to remonetize silver. On
</p>
<p>the contrary the tendency has been in the other direction.
</p>
<p>THE ABSUEDITY OF ASKING EUROPEAN BONDHOLDERS TO REGU-
</p>
<p>LATE AMERICAN FINANCES.
</p>
<p>In 1881 a monetary convention was held in Paris, to
</p>
<p>which the United States sent Commissioners, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of inducing the European Governments to agree upon
</p>
<p>some basis whereby silver could be used as money. The
</p>
<p>folly of sending Commissioners to such a convention will be
</p>
<p>appreciated when the fact is stated that the majority of that
</p>
<p>convention was necessarily composed of the bondholding
</p>
<p>class. The indifference, bordering on contempt, with which
</p>
<p>the proposal of the United States to remonetize silver was
</p>
<p>received, should have been anticipated. It ought not to
</p>
<p>have been expected that the bondholders, who controlled
</p>
<p>the Paris Convention, would remonetize silver, and thereby
</p>
<p>depreciate the value of their securities.
</p>

<p>F. Bayard, Secretary of State, by order of the President,
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>sent Mr.Manton Marble  amono-metallist  to Europe for the
</p>
<p>ostensible purpose of obtaining the " adoption of a com-
</p>
<p>mon ratio between gold and silver for the purpose of estab-
</p>
<p>lishing interuationally the bi-metallic money and securing a
</p>
<p>fixity of value between those metals." Mr. Bayard at the
</p>
<p>same time wrote to the American Ministers in England,
</p>
<p>France and Germany, requesting them to assist Mr. Marble
</p>
<p>in the accomplishment of his mission. He expressed great
</p>
<p>solicitude for an early report from Mr. Marble, and added :
</p>
<p>' ' I trust, therefore, that no later than the 1st of November
</p>
<p>next, with the assistance of Mr. Marble's labors, you will
</p>
<p>enable the President to lay before Congress such informa-
</p>
<p>tion, coupled with proper suggestions, which may make
</p>
<p>practicable such legislation as will meet the grave emer-
</p>
<p>gency."

<p>monetization of silver in Europe and the attitude of the
</p>
<p>bondholding directory is surprising. How he could have
</p>
<p>expected that Mr. Manton Marble  a mono-metallist  would
</p>
<p>be able to induce the European bondholders to adopt a ratio
</p>
<p>between gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing in-
</p>
<p>ternationally bi-metallic money, is incomprehensible. It is
</p>
<p>possible, however, that Mr. Bayard's real object for sending
</p>
<p>Mr. Marble to Europe was to enlighten the American peo-
</p>
<p>ple, by spreading before them, in an official form, the rea-
</p>
<p>sons of the bondholding directory for the violation of the
</p>
<p>obligation of contracts in the demonetization of silver. He
</p>
<p>says that he wants Mr. Marble's report to "enable the
</p>
<p>President to lay before Congress such information, coupled
</p>
<p>with proper suggestions, which may make practicable such
</p>
<p>legislation as will meet the grave emergency." In other
</p>
<p>words, he desires Mr. Marble to collect and import from
</p>
<p>Europe information and suggestions from the bondholding

<p>directory to guide Congress in its deliberations. A mo-
</p>
<p>ment's reflection would have satisfied Mr. Bayard that the
</p>
<p>bondholding directory is sufficiently interested in the actions
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>of CoDgress upon the silver question to furnish all the in-
</p>
<p>formation in its power, without the expense of sending Mr.
</p>
<p>Marble to Europe.
</p>
<p>It is gravely suspected by many that the European bond-
</p>
<p>holding directory had somethiug to do with the clandestine
</p>
<p>legislation whereby the legal tender character of the silver
</p>
<p>dollar was destroyed in the revision of the laws. Every
</p>
<p>American citizen of ordinary intelligence knows that it
</p>
<p>would be less difficult to induce Shylock to surrender his
</p>
<p>pound of flesh than it would be to obtain from Europe a
</p>
<p>recommendation for the restoration of silver to the place it
</p>
<p>occupied when the bonded debts of the world were con-
</p>
<p>tracted. It is to be hoped that the sordid views of the
</p>
<p>bondholders have not reached the President, and that his
</p>
<p>forthcoming message will contain no argument imported
</p>
<p>from Europe. The power of $75,000,000,000 has already
</p>
<p>subsidized the genius of Europe and the metropolitan press
</p>
<p>of America to invent reasons why the debtor ought to pay
</p>
<p>two dollars when he has contracted to pay but one.
</p>
<p>HOW THE PRICE OF SILVER WAS AFFECTED BY HOSTILE LEGISLA-
</p>
<p>TION.
</p>
<p>After silver was demonetized and the fact became known
</p>
<p>by the refusal of the mints to receive it in exchange for
</p>
<p>coin, its value declined, as compared with gold, until the
</p>
<p>year 1878, when its partial remonetization by Congress
</p>
<p>checked its further decline and produced an upward ten-
</p>
<p>dency, which continued until the recent adverse action of
</p>
<p>the present administration. It is now more than twenty-one
</p>
<p>per cent, below par in gold. In 1873 (when silver was de-
</p>
<p>monetized), the amount of silver necessary to make a silver
</p>
<p>dollar was worth over three cents more than the amount of
</p>
<p>gold necessary to make a gold dollar. The present discount
</p>
<p>added to the former premium shows a decline in the value

<p>of silver since 1873, as compared with gold, of about 25 per
</p>
<p>cent. Labor and property since that time have depreciated.
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>as compared with gold, more rapidly than silver. If silver
</p>
<p>is finally demonetized and gold alone used as money, there
</p>
<p>must be a continual decline in the price of labor and prop-
</p>
<p>erty. When the world shall have reached the gold standard,
</p>
<p>the decline in prices will have but just begun, for the pro-
</p>
<p>duction of gold as compared with the demand, is continu-
</p>
<p>ally decreasing. The wear, loss, use in the arts, and the
</p>
<p>increasing demands of commerce, cannot be supplied from
</p>
<p>the mines now known to exist. The probabilities of new
</p>
<p>discoveries are diminisliing year by year as the surface of
</p>
<p>the earth is more minutely examined.
</p>
<p>OPPEESSION OF THE PEOPLE.
</p>
<p>What will be the condition of the laborer when the money
</p>
<p>of tlie world shall be confined to gold alone, and when a
</p>
<p>few thousand men shall have the power to require of each
</p>
<p>generation more than $100,000,000,000 on interest account
</p>
<p>alone ? The contemplation of this vast sum to be paid by
</p>
<p>the producer, in connection with the fact that gold is con-
</p>
<p>stantly decreasing as compared with population, suggests to
</p>
<p>every right-minded man the necessity of immediate resist-
</p>
<p>ance to the bondholder's demands. He must be confined to
</p>
<p>the terms of his contract. He agreed to take either silver or
</p>
<p>gold. He must not be permitted to extort gold and de-
</p>
<p>fraud the debtor of his right to pay in silver.
</p>
<p>In this great contest the United States must be the bat-
</p>
<p>tle-field. In no other country is free discussion allowed.
</p>
<p>No other people have the power to resist. There is too
</p>
<p>much poverty and ignorance in Europe. Poverty and igno-
</p>
<p>rance always submit to oppression until the point of desper-
</p>
<p>ation is reached. Then comes revolution. Eevolution de-
</p>
<p>stroyed the feudal system; it may finally overthrow the
</p>
<p>bondholding directory. The time may come when the

<p>armies of Europe may take sides with the starving popula-

</p>
<p>ARMIES AND NAVIES COLLECT INTEREST.
</p>
<p>To fully appreciate the magnitude, power and motives of
</p>
<p>the bondholding directory, we must take into consideration
</p>
<p>the alarming fact that to-day Europe is a military camp;
</p>
<p>that each of the great Powers have from 150,000 to 1,000,000
</p>
<p>men under arms, and supjDorts, in addition thereto, a vast
</p>
<p>navy. These military establishments serve several pur-
</p>
<p>poses: 1. They increase the national debts, and thereby fur-
</p>
<p>nish bonds for further investment. 2. They increase taxa-
</p>
<p>tion, and thereby make the poor poorer and the rich richer;
</p>
<p>and, 3. They furnish a most effective instrument for the en-
</p>
<p>forcement of taxation. Take, for example, Egypt  a poor,
</p>
<p>half civilized country, allured into contracting an enormous
</p>
<p>debt, which was sold to speculators for from forty to fifty
</p>
<p>cents on the dollar. These speculators well knew that it
</p>
<p>was impossible for the people of Egypt to pay such a debt
</p>
<p>without being reduced to the most abject slavery. Egypt
</p>
<p>defaulted in the payment of interest. The ironclads of the
</p>
<p>most civilized nation on earth razed Alexandria to the ground
</p>
<p>and placed tax-gatherers over the people to exact the utter-
</p>
<p>most farthing. To-day no laborer in Egypt is allowed to eat
</p>
<p>a morsel of bread made from the wheat his labor has pro-
</p>
<p>duced. The same oppression in kind, although perhaps not
</p>
<p>so excessive in degree, exists throughout Europe,
</p>
<p>THE MORTGAGE SYSTEM.
</p>
<p>The system now inaugurated, and which has supplanted
</p>
<p>the feudal system, may be termed the " Mortgage System."
</p>
<p>It has many advantages. The feudal lord was responsible
</p>
<p>for the protection, and, to some extent, the maintenance of
</p>
<p>his serfs. The bondholder is free from all responsibility.
</p>
<p>Hundreds of ironclads and millions of armed men protect
</p>
<p>him and collect the interest on his bonds. With these ad-
</p>
<p>vantages the bondholder ought to be satisfied; but he is not.

<p>He is now scheming to make the bonded debt payable in
</p>
<p>gold coin only. If successful, he will increase more than
</p>
<p>u
</p>
<p>100 per cent, the hours of toil required for the payment of
</p>
<p>the $100,000,000,000 in interest, for which the labor of each
</p>
<p>generation is already mortgaged. We repeat that this fraud
</p>
<p>can only be defeated in the United States. The time for
</p>
<p>discussion in Europe has passed. Nothing but a revolution
</p>
<p>can affect the solid foundation of the bonded system across
</p>
<p>the Atlantic. The armies and navies of the great Powers
</p>
<p>are already sufficient to suppress the nihilist, communist, so-
</p>
<p>cialist, and even the great body of the people, if the divine
</p>
<p>right of the bondholder is questioned.
</p>
<p>LEGISLATION OF CONGEESS IN REGARD TO GOLD AND SILVER COIN.
</p>
<p>The dollar devised by Hamilton and authorized to be
</p>
<p>coined by the Act of April 2, 1792, consisted of 416 grains
</p>
<p>of standard silver; fineness, 892 4-10; equivalent to 371^
</p>
<p>grains of pure silver, with 44f grains alloy of pure copper.
</p>
<p>The weighi of the dollar was changed by the Act of January
</p>
<p>18, 1837, to 412^ grains of standard silver; fineness changed
</p>
<p>to 900, preserving the same amount of pure silver  to wit:
</p>
<p>371^ grains, with one-tenth alloy. By both the Acts of 1792
</p>
<p>and 1837, the subsidiary coins  to wit: the half-dollar, quar-
</p>
<p>ter-dollar, dime and half-dime, had the same proportion of
</p>
<p>standard silver as the silver dollar. In 1853 the amount of
</p>
<p>silver in the subsidiary coins was reduced by Act of Con-
</p>
<p>gress, and those coins were declared to be legal tender for
</p>
<p>only $5. The dollar was not affected by that Act, but re-
</p>
<p>mained the unit of value and a full legal tender until the
</p>
<p>passage of the Acts of 1873 and 1874, hereafter noticed.
</p>
<p>BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE UNITED STATES.
</p>
<p>The bonds issued for the suppression of the rebellion were
</p>
<p>payable in lawful money or greenbacks  the same kind of
</p>
<p>money with which the soldier was paid  interest only being
</p>
<p>payable in coin. These bonds were sold for from forty to fifty
</p>
<p>cents on the dollar in coin. After peace was declared the

</p>
<p>bondholder contended that one of the inducements for his
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>investment was his patriotism, and that therefore he was
</p>
<p>entitled to special consideration. Besides, he claimed that
</p>
<p>it was generally understood that the bonds of the United
</p>
<p>States would ultimately be paid in coin. On March 18,
</p>
<p>1869 (after the first election of President Grant), "An Act
</p>
<p>to strengthen the public credit" was passed, which declared
</p>
<p>that the bonds of the United States were payable in coin.
</p>
<p>This Act greatly enhanced the value of United States bonds,
</p>
<p>and was exceedingly liberal to the bondholders  and per-
</p>
<p>haps unjust to the people; but it was fairly considered, and
</p>
<p>no one is charged with fraudulent practices in securing its
</p>
<p>passage. Besides, the question was submitted to the people
</p>
<p>at General Grant's first election in November, 1868, and de-
</p>
<p>cided in favor of paying the bonds in coin. Thereafter, on
</p>
<p>the 14th day of July, 1870, an Act was passed "to authorize
</p>
<p>the refunding of the national debt," in which the pledge of
</p>
<p>the United States to pay the debt in coin was renewed. It
</p>
<p>was provided in that Act that the bonds issued under its
</p>
<p>provisions should be redeemable in coin of the standard
</p>
<p>value of July 14, 1870  that is to say, in gold dollars con-
</p>
<p>sisting of 25 8-10 grains of standard gold, or in silver dollars
</p>
<p>of 412|^ grains of standard silver. If the bondholder had
</p>
<p>been honest he would have been fully satisfied with the gen-
</p>
<p>erosity of the Government in making its obligations  which
</p>
<p>were originally payable in greenbacks  payable in coin. He
</p>
<p>was not honest, and therefore he was not satisfied. As soon
</p>
<p>as he had secured the change of his contract from an agree-
</p>
<p>ment to pay greenbacks to an agreement to pay coin, he com-
</p>
<p>menced to connive with European bondholders to convert
</p>
<p>his contract for coin into a contract for gold alone. Through
</p>
<p>inattention or some secret agency, the Acts of 1873 and
</p>
<p>1874  demonetizing silver  were passed without debate and
</p>
<p>without the attention of either House being called to the

</p>
<p>tion to pay its bonded obligation in either gold or silver.

</p>
<p>THE STAXDAED DOLLAR OMITTED FROM THE LIST OF COINS.
</p>
<p>'The first assault upon the dollar of Hamilton was con-
</p>
<p>tained in a long Act (consisting of sixty-seven sections)
</p>
<p>"revising and amending the laws relative to the mints,
</p>
<p>assay-offices and coinage of the United States." The Act
</p>
<p>was approved February 12, 1873. The section enumerating
</p>
<p>the silver coins in this Act (Section 15) makes no mention of
</p>
<p>the silver dollar, but provides for what is called a " trade
</p>
<p>dollar,' ' to contain 420 grains of standard silver. The object
</p>
<p>of the bill, as expressed in the title, was to "revise and amend
</p>
<p>the laws relative to the mints, assay-offices and coinage of
</p>
<p>the United States." It was not supposed that in such a law
</p>
<p>there would be any radical change in the laws of the United
</p>
<p>States with regard to the use of silver as money. The at-
</p>
<p>tention of Congress was not called to the fact that the silver
</p>
<p>dollar was omitted, and this fact was probably unknown to
</p>
<p>all except those having immediate charge of the bill, and if
</p>
<p>known, it is not at all probable that the effect of the law
</p>
<p>would have been understood. Besides, neither gold nor sil-
</p>
<p>ver was in general circulation as money in the United States
</p>
<p>at that time, and the necessity of coining either was proba-
</p>
<p>bly not regarded as very pressing.
</p>
<p>The object of the trade dollar, provided for in that Act,
</p>
<p>was stated to be for circulation in China. It was said that
</p>
<p>the standard dollar of 412| grains was less in weight than
</p>
<p>the Mexican dollar, which circulated in China, and that our
</p>
<p>trade with China would be greatly benefited by coining a
</p>
<p>dollar worth as much or a little more than the Mexican dol-
</p>
<p>lar. It was not pretended that the trade dollar was to be
</p>
<p>circulated in the United States.
</p>
<p>The standard dollar was not, however, demonetized by
</p>
<p>this Act. It was simply omitted from the list of coins,
</p>
<p>and this fact was not observed or commented upon in either

<p>17
</p>
<p>DEMONETIZATION OF THE STANDARD DOLLAR.
</p>
<p>The boDcIholding directory was not satisfied with the simple
</p>
<p>omission of the standard dolhir from the list of coins, for so
</p>
<p>long as it remained a legal tender to any amount, it could
</p>
<p>again be added to the list without any change of the unit of
</p>
<p>value in the coins of the United States. Its manipulators,
</p>
<p>therefore, deemed it necessary to demonetize the standard
</p>
<p>dollar and destroy its legal tender character. This was
</p>
<p>surreptitiously accomplished. At the time of the passage
</p>
<p>of the Act of February 12, 1873, the statutes of the United
</p>
<p>States were being revised by a commission acting under a
</p>
<p>law which did not authorize new legislation, but simply
</p>
<p>contemplated a codification and rearrangement of existing
</p>
<p>laws. Notwithstanding this fact, a provision was inserted
</p>
<p>by some unknown agency, destroying the legal tender char-
</p>
<p>acter of the standard dollar. It is in the following lan-
</p>
<p>guage :
</p>
<p>"The silver coins of the United States shall be a legal
</p>
<p>tender at their nominal value for any amount not exceeding
</p>
<p>$5 in any one payment." (Revised Statutes United States,
</p>
<p>Sec. 3586.)
</p>
<p>The Revised Statutes of the United States is a very large
</p>
<p>volume  a volume so large that it was impracticable to read
</p>
<p>it in either House of Congress. In 1874 this volume was
</p>
<p>adopted by Congress and the reading dispensed with on the
</p>
<p>assurance of the Commissioners charged with the duty of
</p>
<p>codifying the laws that they had inserted no new legislation.
</p>
<p>The fact^that Section 3586  demonetizing silver  was in the
</p>
<p>Revised Statutes, was not publicly known until a long time
</p>
<p>after the^adoption of the revision.
</p>
<p>THE PARTIAL REMONETIZATION OF SILVER.
</p>
<p>On the 28th of February, 1878, an Act was passed "to
</p>
<p>authorize the coinage of the standard silver dollar, and to
</p>
<p>2

</p>
<p>jrestore its legal tender character." This Act made the sil-
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>ver dollar a legal tender for any amonnt, and it provided
</p>
<p>that the Secretary of the Treasury should purchase at the
</p>
<p>market price not less than $2,000,000 nor more than 4,000,-
</p>
<p>000 of silver bullion per month for coinage. This was a
</p>
<p>partial remonetization of silver. The Act, however, did
</p>
<p>not authorize the owner of silver bullion to exchange it at
</p>
<p>the mints for coin on any terms, nor to deliver it at the
</p>
<p>Treasury of the United States and receive silver certificates
</p>
<p>therefor. But notwithstanding the refusal (or neglect) of
</p>
<p>the Treasury Department to execute this law in good faith
</p>
<p>(as we shall hereafter see), the further decline of silver was
</p>
<p>checked by the Act of 1878, and an upward tendency was
</p>
<p>produced thereby, which continued until the war to demon-
</p>
<p>etize silver was renewed under the present administration.
</p>
<p>Great credit is due to the zeal and patriotism of the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of Congress who passed this Act and checked the evil
</p>
<p>work of the bondholding directory. The names of Jones,
</p>
<p>of Nevada; Bland, of Missouri; Keagan, of Texas; Warner,
</p>
<p>of Ohio, and their co-workers, will not be forgotten. It is
</p>
<p>the only considerable victory which has been won by the
</p>
<p>people against the despotic power of money since the bond-
</p>
<p>holder has assumed dictatorial power in the financial world.
</p>
<p>The report of Senator Jones, and his great argument in the
</p>
<p>Senate on the passage of this Act, was the first impartial
</p>
<p>and philosophical exposition of the money question after
</p>
<p>the conspiracy to demonetize one of the precious metals
</p>
<p>was formed. His argument against the demonetization
</p>
<p>of silver remains unanswered. The bondholder now de-
</p>
<p>mands the repeal of the Act of 1878. But he cannot
</p>
<p>succeed if the present House of Representatives is com-
</p>
<p>posed of as brave and patriotic material as the last. The
</p>
<p>example of the members of the last House who resisted
</p>
<p>the President's demand for the passage of a law demonetiz-

<p>ing silver, furnishes one of the brightest pages of our his-
</p>
<p>tory. It is difficult for a member of Congress to refuse any
</p>
<p>request from the President of the United States with 100,-
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>000 offices at his disposal; but to refuse the request of the
</p>
<p>President, when that request is reinforced by the power of
</p>
<p>$75,000,000,000, is evidence of the purest patriotism.
</p>
<p>EESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENT.
</p>
<p>It has been suggested by the attorneys of the bondhold-
</p>
<p>ing directory that the Act of January 14, 1875, entitled "An
</p>
<p>Act to provide for the resumption of specie payments," obli-
</p>
<p>gated the Government to pay the bonded indebtedness in
</p>
<p>gold. This claim is as destitute of truth as it is bold and
</p>
<p>arrogant. The following extract from that Act will show the
</p>
<p>fallacy of the claim :
</p>
<p>" And on and after the first day of January, anno Domini
</p>
<p>eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, the Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Treasury shall redeem, in coin, the United States legal ten-
</p>
<p>der notes then outstanding, on their presentation for re-
</p>
<p>demption at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the
</p>
<p>United States in the City of New York, in sums of not less
</p>
<p>than fifty dollars. And ro enable the Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Treasury to prepare and provide for the redemption in this
</p>
<p>Act, authorized or required, he is authorized to use any sur-

<p>money in which the .United States bonds are to be paid.
</p>
<p>It is expressly provided in the part of the Act above quoted
</p>
<p>that the bonds which are therein authorized to be sold to
</p>
<p>obtain coin with which to resume specie paj^nents were to
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>be issued under the provisions of the Act of July 14, 1870.
</p>
<p>We have already seen that all bonds issued under the pro-
</p>
<p>visions of that Act may be redeemed in silver dollars con-
</p>
<p>sisting of 412| grains of standard silver, if the Government
</p>
<p>elects to pay them in that kind of coin. After the passage
</p>
<p>of the Kefunding Act of July 14, 1870, it was the duty of
</p>
<p>the Government to provide gold and silver dollars of the
</p>
<p>standard value of that date with which to redeem the bonds
</p>
<p>issued under that Act. If gold and silver had both been
</p>
<p>demonetized and paper substituted therefor, does any one
</p>
<p>pretend that it would not liave been right and proper for
</p>
<p>the United States to coin gold and silver dollars to be used
</p>
<p>in payment of the bonds according to the terms of the law
</p>
<p>under which they w-ere issued ? Why is it not both the
</p>
<p>right and duty of the Government to continue the coinage
</p>
<p>of silver dollars for the purpose of complying with its obli-
</p>
<p>gation to pay the bondholder in silver ? If silver were the
</p>
<p>dearer metal the bondholders would demand its coin-
</p>
<p>age. It being the cheaper metal, why may not the
</p>
<p>people demand that it be coined and used in the discharge
</p>
<p>of all Government obligations which are payable in silver ?
</p>
<p>We maintain that when the bondholder is paid in silver for
</p>
<p>a debt originally contracted in greenbacks, he will receive
</p>
<p>more than he contracted for; but whether the bondholder
</p>
<p>was benefited or not by exchanging a contract payable in
</p>
<p>greenbacks to a contract payable in coin, is immaterial for
</p>
<p>the purposes of this argument. The question now is: Shall
</p>
<p>the rights of the bondholders and of the people be adjusted
</p>
<p>according to the existing contract, or shall the contract be
</p>
<p>again changed for the purpose of enhancing the value of
</p>
<p>bonds? We advise the bondholder to pause and reflect be-
</p>
<p>fore he again departs from the letter of his contract,
</p>
<p>and attempts to obtain more than is named in the bond.

</p>
<p>African slavery was guarded and protected by as perfect a
</p>
<p>framework of constitutions and laws as huinan ingenuity could
</p>
<p>invent. It was abolished by the sword, without compensa-
</p>
<p>tion to the owners of slaves. The $75,000,000,000 of bonded
</p>
<p>indebtedness rests upon contracts no move zealously guarded
</p>
<p>by law than the title of the American planter to the African
</p>
<p>slave. It will not do to so increase the difficulties of paying
</p>
<p>the bonded debt as to involve the enslavement of the pro-
</p>
<p>ducer, for in that event there may be a demand for an
</p>
<p>equitable adjustment of contracts that will disturb the
</p>
<p>peace of society. Is the bondholder prepared to ad-
</p>
<p>just equities with the laborer ? Dare he say to the poor-
</p>
<p>est laborer in Christendom : ' ' You and I were born equal,
</p>
<p>and neither of us ought to enjoy of this world's goods more
</p>
<p>than the labor of his hands has produced, and we will adjust
</p>
<p>our equities on that basis ?" The whole superstructure of
</p>
<p>the bondholder's power rests upon the strict adherence to
</p>
<p>the letter of the contract. We, therefore, warn him to abide
</p>
<p>by the terras of his contract, for if equities are invoked, the
</p>
<p>luxuries which he now enjoys may be exchanged for pov-
</p>
<p>erty and toil. We especially warn him. to proceed no fur-
</p>
<p>ther in his attempt to convert existing contracts payable in
</p>
<p>either gold or silver into contracts payable in gold alone, or
</p>
<p>the laboring classes may demand an adjustment of equities,
</p>
<p>which he will have no power to deny.

<p>NATIONAL BANKS.
</p>
<p>The national bankers, at a convention held at Chicago on
</p>
<p>September 23d last, passed the following resolution :
</p>
<p>^'Resolved, That it is the sense of the convention that the
</p>
<p>coinage of the silver dollars, under the compulsory law of
</p>
<p>1878, is detrimental to the best interests of the people and
</p>
<p>dangerous to the welfare of the Government, and that the
</p>
<p>law should be immediately suspended, and remain inopera-

</p>
<p>tive until an international agreement of the leading commer-
</p>
<p>cial nations shall give substantial assurance as to the future
</p>
<p>relation of gold and silver as money."
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>lu other words, the national bank managers resolved that
</p>
<p>silver should be demonetized until the European bondhold-
</p>
<p>ing directory should otherwise dictate. The cool assurance
</p>
<p>which these bankers assume in pretending to advocate the
</p>
<p>best interests of the people and the Government leads to the
</p>
<p>inquiry as to who they are and what they represent. If, on
</p>
<p>investigation, it shall appear that they are subsidized monop-
</p>
<p>olists and allies of European bondholders, their advice may
</p>
<p>not be regarded as valuable unless supported by argument.
</p>
<p>This favored class came into existence in the following
</p>
<p>manner: Greenbacks drawing no interest were in circulation
</p>
<p>as money. The Government was induced to issue interest-
</p>
<p>bearing bonds, and purchase and retire therewith a large
</p>
<p>amount of the greenbacks then in circulation  say $400,000,-
</p>
<p>000. This created an excuse for issuing other paper to sup-
</p>
<p>ply the deficiency created by the retirement of the green-
</p>
<p>backs. The national banks were allowed to deposit in the
</p>
<p>Treasury the bonds of the United States issued to retire the
</p>
<p>greenbacks and draw interest thereon; and in addition
</p>
<p>thereto the Government furnished the national banks, free
</p>
<p>of charge, the use of paper money issued by the Government
</p>
<p>and called "National Currency," to the extent of ninety
</p>
<p>cents on the dollar of the amount of bonds deposited. The
</p>
<p>Government thereby succeeded in substituting one kind of
</p>
<p>paper money, called ''National Bank Notes," for another
</p>
<p>kind of paper money, commonly called "Greenbacks" 
</p>
<p>both resting for validity upon the credit of the United States.
</p>
<p>This change has cost the Government from $12,000,000 to
</p>
<p>$15,000,000 in interest annually for the last twenty years. In
</p>
<p>order to justify the change and show that national bank notes
</p>
<p>are better than greenbacks, the advocates of the national
</p>
<p>banks would have us believe that money issued and guar-
</p>
<p>anteed by the United States is not money until it is reissued

<p>by some person calling himself a "National Banker," and
</p>
<p>that the credit of. the United States is so bad that it can only
</p>
<p>issue money through a stranger, who might be termed either
</p>
<p>John Doe or Richard Eoe. Although the holders of green-
</p>
<p>backs have had the privilege for more than ten years of
</p>
<p>exchanging them for coin, there are now in circulation,
</p>
<p>on a par with gold, about $360,000,000 of that kind of
</p>
<p>currency. It has always been difficult for the national
</p>
<p>banks to explain why the United States retired green-
</p>
<p>backs drawing no interest, and substituted therefor national
</p>
<p>bank notes at so great a sacrifice. Many people now be-
</p>
<p>lieve that there is no satisfactory reason why green-
</p>
<p>backs should not be reissued and exchanged for bonds,
</p>
<p>and the' $324, 000, 000 of national currency retired. Would it
</p>
<p>not be well for the national bank manipulators to furnish a
</p>
<p>good reason for their own existence before they attempt to
</p>
<p>destroy silver? Can any satisfactory reason be given why
</p>
<p>silver should not be remonetized and again received at the
</p>
<p>mints, and certificates guaranteed by the Government issued
</p>
<p>therefor? Why should not such certificates, guaranteed by
</p>
<p>the Government and secured by the deposit of silver bullion
</p>
<p>be as good money as national bank notes with no security
</p>
<p>or guarantee other than the credit of the United States?
</p>
<p>Have the national banks any other objection to the use of
</p>
<p>silver than the fact that its remonetization and the issuance
</p>
<p>of silver certificates based on the deposit of bullion would
</p>
<p>supersede the necessity of national bank notes? The reso-
</p>
<p>lutions of these national bank managers must be read in the
</p>
<p>light of the fact that it is worth more than 12,000,000 a year
</p>
<p>to them to prevent the retirement of the national bank notes
</p>
<p>by substituting therefor either silver coin or silver certificates.
</p>
<p>It must also be remembered that the correspondents of
</p>
<p>these national banks in Europe are controlled by the bond-
</p>
<p>liolding directory, and that the financial credit of these
</p>
<p>American banks depends upon the fidelity with which they
</p>
<p>serve the great financial operators who control and direct
</p>
<p>the policy of the bondholders. There are about twenty-

<p>seven hundred national banks, which are always ready on
</p>
<p>"call" to furnish the managers of the lobby such a per-
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>centage of the $12,000,000 subsidy which tliej receive from
</p>
<p>the United States aunuall}^ as may be required to perpetuate
</p>
<p>their power. The combination of these national banks and
</p>
<p>European bondholders is indeed formidable, and threatens
</p>
<p>the liberties of the people of the United States. But there is
</p>
<p>no doubt that the people will finally triumph against na-
</p>
<p>tional banks and bondholding syndicates as they did in the
</p>
<p>time of Jackson, when a less objectionable institution called
</p>
<p>the United States Bank was throttled and destroyed.
</p>
<p>We do not object to bankers any more than we do to
</p>
<p>shoemakers, merchants, or mechanics of any kind. It is
</p>
<p>the subsidy to which we object. In proof that a subsidy is
</p>
<p>no more necessary in the banking business than in any
</p>
<p>other, we call attention to the fact that the principal com-
</p>
<p>mercial banks of the Pacific Coast do business on their own
</p>
<p>money, without subsidies, and their financial standing is as
</p>
<p>good as any banks in the United States.
</p>
<p>CONGEESS TO EEGULATE THE VALUE OF MONEY.
</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States provides that
</p>
<p>"Congress shall have power * '^ ^ to coin money and
</p>
<p>regulate the value thereof. " Under this provision the
</p>
<p>United States continues to some extent to coin money, but
</p>
<p>does not regulate its value. It is true that the units of
</p>
<p>value of the coins of the United States are called dollars,
</p>
<p>and that a gold dollar contains 25 8-10 grains of stand-
</p>
<p>ard gold, and a silver dollar 412J grains of standard
</p>
<p>silver. But this does not determine the value of the coin.
</p>
<p>The value of each dollar (as we have already seen) is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the number of dollars in use in the United States,
</p>
<p>and not by the quality or quantity of the material of which
</p>
<p>the dollar is made. The amount of material to make a sil-
</p>
<p>ver dollar is worth twenty-one per cent. less than the amount
</p>
<p>of material necessary to make a gold dollar, and the mate-

</p>
<p>rial necessary to make a paper dollar  whether that paper
</p>
<p>dollar be greenback or national currency  is comparatively
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>nothing; and yet each of these dollars has the same pur-
</p>
<p>chasing power. If the present circulating medium  con-
</p>
<p>sisting of national currency, greenbacks, silver and gold
</p>
<p>dollars  were doubled by the issue of gold or silver, green-
</p>
<p>backs or national currency, the value of each dollar now in
</p>
<p>circulation would be reduced about one-half. This would
</p>
<p>be unfair to the creditor class, but it would be no more un-
</p>
<p>fair than the demonetization of silver would be to the debtor
</p>
<p>class. It is the duty of Congress to regulate the value of
</p>
<p>money so that neither the debtor nor the creditor can be
</p>
<p>robbed by violent contraction or expansion.
</p>
<p>NEW YOEK CITY .
</p>
<p>It is not surprising that New York City should be opposed
</p>
<p>to silver. Its business relations with the bondholdiug syn-
</p>
<p>dicate of Europe are exceedingly intimate. It deals in se-
</p>
<p>curities, imports foreign goods and apes foreign manners.
</p>
<p>Many of its business houses are either branches of European
</p>
<p>establishments or are so connected with the business of
</p>
<p>Europe as to be under the immediate influence of the bond-
</p>
<p>holding directory. The people of the United States cannot
</p>
<p>submit to dictation from either New York or Europe. They
</p>
<p>must have an independent financial policy of their own.
</p>
<p>Civil liberty cannot survive financial slavery. It may take
</p>
<p>time for the people to comprehend the designs of Europe
</p>
<p>on the liberty of this country, but sooner or later the
</p>
<p>money question will be understood. The metropolitan
</p>
<p>press may, for a time, mislead good men, but if the fraudu-
</p>
<p>lent practices of European bondholders are continued much
</p>
<p>longer in this country, the day of retribution will shake the
</p>
<p>foundations of society. Let it now be averted by an honest
</p>
<p>observance of the obligation of contracts.

<p>WHY SILVER DOES NOT CIRCULATE,

<p>The reason why silver does not circulate freely is because

</p>
<p>the Treasury officials refuse to obey the law and put it in
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>circulation. Although the bonded indebtedness of the
</p>
<p>United States^both principal and interest  is payable in
</p>
<p>silver, not a dollar of that metal has been paid in liquida-
</p>
<p>tion of the public debt. On the contrary, in July last, the
</p>
<p>Treasury Department, according to its long-established pol-
</p>
<p>icy, borrowed of the national banks of New York, through
</p>
<p>the clearing house of that city, $6,000,000 in gold, and issued
</p>
<p>fractional currency therefor. The excuse given for this re-
</p>
<p>markable transaction was to strengthen the Federal Govern-
</p>
<p>ment's gold reserve, and to furnish it with gold to pay in-
</p>
<p>terest on the national debt. It is a remarkable fact that
</p>
<p>while the Secretary of the Treasury  himself recently a
</p>
<p>national banker  was supplicating his fellow national bank-
</p>
<p>ers to save the Government of the United States from bank-
</p>
<p>ruptcy by the loan of 6,000,000, the Treasury was over-
</p>
<p>flowing with silver applicable to the payment of the
</p>
<p>principal and interest of the public debt. If the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Treasury could have been induced to regard the
</p>
<p>Acts of Congress with some respect, he would not have felt
</p>
<p>himself compelled, at the dictation of any bondholdiug syn-
</p>
<p>dicate to allow silver to lie idle in the vaults of the Treasury,
</p>
<p>and to complain of want of storage room for that money,
</p>
<p>while there was a demand for it for the payment of interest
</p>
<p>on United States bonds. It is to be regretted that so
</p>
<p>many members of Congress and Treasury officials have
</p>
<p>been connected with national banks. If a Secretary of the
</p>
<p>Treasury, free from relations or complications with national
</p>
<p>banks or bondbolding syndicates, could be appointed, there
</p>
<p>might be some hope that the laws of Congress would be en-
</p>
<p>forced. It can hardlj' be expected, however, that any person
</p>
<p>interested in a national bank or connected with those syndi-
</p>
<p>cates will be able to impartially administer the laws of Con-
</p>
<p>gress regulating the currency of the United States.

</p>
<p>CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES.
</p>
<p>We hear much from Treasury officials about preserving
</p>
<p>the sacred credit of the United States. This is all sham.
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>The credit of the United States is already too good. Bonds
</p>
<p>upon which the Government realized only forty per cent, and
</p>
<p>has paid more than an hundred cents on the dollar in iuterest,
</p>
<p>are to-day selling for 120 cents  an advance of 200 per cent.
</p>
<p>This results in part from the restoration of peace and the
</p>
<p>growth and prosperity of the country, but i^rincipally from
</p>
<p>the various changes in the contract between the Government
</p>
<p>and its creditors, produced by legislation and the refusal of the
</p>
<p>Treasury officials to obey the law. Bonds payable in green-
</p>
<p>backs (as we have already seen) were made payable by Act
</p>
<p>of Congress in coin. Bonds payable in either gold or silver
</p>
<p>are paid b}'^ Treasury officials in gold alone, thereby creating
</p>
<p>an extraordinary demand for gold and enhancing its price,
</p>
<p>and depreciating silver. Nothing but a gross violation of
</p>
<p>law and a partiality for bondholders could induce the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of the Treasury to refuse to pay bonds in silver when
</p>
<p>the law so provides, and when the people would be benefited
</p>
<p>thereby. How dare any Secretary of the Treasury give to
</p>
<p>the bondholder twenty to twenty-five per cent, more than
</p>
<p>the law requires ? Why should not the credit of the United
</p>
<p>States be good when the Government is made to pay three
</p>
<p>times as much as it agreed to pay ? Our national debt at the
</p>
<p>close of the war was, in round numbers, $2,800,000,000-^$!,-
</p>
<p>000,000,000 of which has been paid. The remaining $1,800,-
</p>
<p>000,000 is more than double the amount of the $2,800,000,000
</p>
<p>as it existed at the close of the war, if measured by days of
</p>
<p>labor, bushels of wheat or bales of cotton. If the Treasury
</p>
<p>officials are not required to obey the law, but may pay the
</p>
<p>bondholder as much as they please and in any kind of money
</p>
<p>they choose, the United States, with its boasted resources,
</p>
<p>may never be able to liquidate the national debt. Since
</p>
<p>1865 to the present time, for every dollar paid on the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal of the national debt two dollars have been added by

<p>manipulation. Is it not time that the people were informed
</p>
<p>of the practices by which financial robbery is conducted
</p>
<p>wholesale at their expense ?

</p>
<p>WHAT LEGISLATION IS WANTED.
</p>
<p>If Congress would authorize the Treasury Department to
</p>
<p>receive all silver bullion offered at the rate of 41 2| grains of
</p>
<p>standard silv6r for a dollar, in exchange for coin or silver
</p>
<p>certificates at the option of the Government, and retain the
</p>
<p>bullion so received as security for the certificates issued
</p>
<p>therefor, and make such certificates a full legal tender for
</p>
<p>all purposes and to any amount, silver would be remone-
</p>
<p>tized, and the currency of the United States would be placed
</p>
<p>on a solid metallic basis. If, however, this cannot be done,
</p>
<p>let the present law be executed. By the Act of 1878 the
</p>
<p>Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to invest $4,000,000
</p>
<p>a month in the purchase of silver bullion. Let him pur-
</p>
<p>chase the full amount each month, coin it, and pay it out
</p>
<p>for public dues. If the people do not like silver dollars they
</p>
<p>need not use them. Silver coin can now be converted into
</p>
<p>silver certificates at the option of the owner. Persons having
</p>
<p>silver coin may deposit it in the Treasury and receive certifi-
</p>
<p>cates therefor, which are "receivable for customs, taxes and
</p>
<p>all public dues." No one receiving silver coin from the
</p>
<p>Government need move it from the vaults of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>He can change it before it is removed or at any time thereaf-
</p>
<p>ter for paper, which is on a par with gold. While it would be
</p>
<p>better to coin no more silver than the necessities of com-

<p>expense of coinage until a law can be passed for the

<p>retary of the Treasury who would act in the interests

</p>
<p>$4,000,000 a month in silver bullion would soon exhaust
</p>
<p>the surplus in the market, and create such a demand for
</p>
<p>silver as to advance it to par with gold. The present produc-
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>tiou of silver is not in excess of the demand from India and
</p>
<p>China. The additional demand Avhich would be created by
</p>
<p>the investment of $4,000,000 a month, instead of 12,000,000,
</p>
<p>in the purchase of silver bullion, with the avowed purpose
</p>
<p>on the part of the United States to remonetize it, would
</p>
<p>settle the question in favor of silver as money. If the bond-
</p>
<p>holders were paid in silver, they would become interested in
</p>
<p>appreciating it. It would then become their money, and
</p>
<p>they would not hire newspapers to give it a bad name. Be-
</p>
<p>sides, the prompt payment of Government dues in silver to
</p>
<p>the extent of the full amount that could be coined from
</p>
<p>$4,000,000 a month worth of bullion would put in circula-
</p>
<p>tion about $50,000,000 a year of silver coin or certificates.
</p>
<p>Fifty million dollars a year of coin or silver certificates
</p>
<p>would take the place of the hot-house plants called national
</p>
<p>bank notes, as fast as the bonds upon which they are issued
</p>
<p>can be paid and retired. This would avoid any more special
</p>
<p>or class legislation to put out or keep out the national bank
</p>
<p>notes.
</p>
<p>NO COMPROMISE.
</p>
<p>The advocates of bi-metallic money must consent to no com-
</p>
<p>promise. Silver must be either fully remonetized or the
</p>
<p>present law enforced. The people are not suflaciently versed
</p>
<p>in intrigue to cope with the bondholding directory in the
</p>
<p>construction of doubtful laws. Every doubtful expres-
</p>
<p>sion in any law will be construed in favor of the bond-
</p>
<p>holders. The proposition known as the Warner Bill has
</p>
<p>much to commend it, but the difiiculty is that many of its
</p>
<p>provisions are subject to construction, and that the Treasury
</p>
<p>Department must execute it. The influence of the bond-
</p>
<p>holding directory in that Department must not be over-
</p>
<p>looked. If, according to the general plan of the Warner
</p>
<p>Bill, the Government would receive in good faith all silver

<p>bullion ofi'ered at the market price, on the day of the offer,
</p>
<p>in exchange for coin or certificates, which should be a full
</p>
<p>legal tender for every purpose, and to any amount, and re-
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>tain on deposit the bullion so received as security for such
</p>
<p>certificates, and the Treasury officials would execute such
</p>
<p>a law, silver would be fully remonetized, and would be very
</p>
<p>soon placed on a par with gold at the ratio now established.
</p>
<p>The difference between the receipt of bullion by the United
</p>
<p>States at the rate of 412| grains of standard silver for
</p>
<p>a dollar and its receipt at its market value in gold, so far
</p>
<p>as ultimate results are concerned (if such a law could be
</p>
<p>executed), is more imaginary than real. The receipt by the
</p>
<p>United States of all silver bullion offered on either plan would
</p>
<p>make an unlimited market for silver, which would place it
</p>
<p>on a par with gold according to the ratio of 15 98-100 to 1
</p>
<p>before the United States could possibly obtain the amount
</p>
<p>necessary to meet the increasing demand for a circulating
</p>
<p>medium. If, however, silver should be received at its mar-
</p>
<p>ket value in gold, it would be necessary to limit the price
</p>
<p>and provide that no higher price should be paid for silver
</p>
<p>in exchange for coin or certificates than the ratio of 15 98-
</p>
<p>100 to 1, or silver would rise above that ratio.
</p>
<p>THE SUBSTITUTION OP CARTWHEELS FOR DOLLARS.
</p>
<p>The mosb dishonest and insidious proposition that has
</p>
<p>been suggested is to increase the amount of silver requisite
</p>
<p>to make a silver dollar. It is suggested by some that the
</p>
<p>silver dollar should be composed of 1:80 grains instead of
</p>
<p>412| grains. It is also suggested that no more dollars
</p>
<p>shall be coined, but that half dollars, consisting of
</p>
<p>240 grains each, should be coined after this change shall
</p>
<p>have been made. It is argued that half dollars of
</p>
<p>that size will not be as cumbersome as the present dollar
</p>
<p>of 412| grains. The frigid impudence of either of these
</p>
<p>propositions would be surprising if we were not accustomed
</p>
<p>to the demands of the boudholdiug directory to change the
</p>
<p>basis of their contracts with the people at pleasure. The

<p>bondholders, as we have already seen, have, by their agents
</p>
<p>in Europe, and in the Treasury Department of the United
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>States, depressed the value of silver about twenty-five per
</p>
<p>cent, as compared with gold, and they now propose to make
</p>
<p>it equal to gold by adding more silver. When this is done,
</p>
<p>they will again depreciate the value of silver by their manip-
</p>
<p>ulations, and add more silver, until a silver dollar will
</p>
<p>be as lai"^e as a cartwheel, silver mining stopped, and silver
</p>
<p>demonetized by this cuttle-fish process.
</p>
<p>If the remonetization of silver, or the enforcement of
</p>
<p>existing laws, should result in the retirement of the national
</p>
<p>banks and the relief of the Treasury of its idle surplus
</p>
<p>revenue in the redemption of the bonds upon which the
</p>
<p>national bank notes were issued, no honest man ought to
</p>
<p>complain. The readjustment on the original basis of the
</p>
<p>contract between the bondholder and the people is certainly
</p>
<p>desirable. The extortion contemplated by the demonetiza-
</p>
<p>tion of silver must be prevented by restoring that metal to
</p>
<p>its original place. Nothing short of that will satisfy the
</p>
<p>people.
</p>
<p>Let it not be supposed that any person not holding a bond,
</p>
<p>the payment of which is absolutely secure, can be benefited
</p>
<p>by contraction. Even the money-lender suffers with the
</p>
<p>balance of the community. The rate of interest declines,
</p>
<p>and money flows to financial centers and remains idle for
</p>
<p>want of confidence and good security, and also because
</p>
<p>prudent men will not borrow  that is, sell money " short" 
</p>
<p>while it is increasing in value.
</p>
<p>In conclusion we ask : Why should entei"prise be crushed,
</p>
<p>the laborer thrown out of employment, and gloom and
</p>
<p>misery be spread over the land to satisfy the selfish greed
</p>
<p>of the bondholder? Let the arrogant bondholder take warn-
</p>
<p>ing from history. Revolution and repudiation are written
</p>
<p>on all its pages. Oppression in the end destroys the op-
</p>
<p>pressor as well as the oppressed. The only absolute secur-

<p>Carson City, Nev., November 27, 1885.
</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENT
</p>
<p>COMMENTS ON PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE ON THE
</p>
<p>SILVER QUESTION.
</p>
<p>Since the foregoing pages were printed, the President's
</p>
<p>message has been received. That remarkable document
</p>
<p>contains all the arguments that Manton Marble was able to
</p>
<p>import from Europe, and all the sophistry that the managers
</p>
<p>of the national banks could invent in America. It boldl\
</p>
<p>recommends the repeal of the Act of 1878, and the utter de-
</p>
<p>monetization of silver.
</p>
<p>DOES AN INCREASE OF COINAGE PRODUCE CONTRACTION?
</p>
<p>The President admits the disastrous effects of a decreasing
</p>
<p>circulating medium, but boldly utters the manifest paradox
</p>
<p>that the coining of money produces contraction. In other
</p>
<p>words, the more coin the more contraction. The President
</p>
<p>says:
</p>
<p>"Those who do not fear any disastrous consequences
</p>
<p>arising from the continued compulsory coinage of silver as
</p>
<p>now directed by law, and who suppose that the addition to
</p>
<p>the currency of the country intended as its result will be
</p>
<p>a public benefit, are reminded that history demonstrates
</p>
<p>that the point is easily reached in the attempt to float at the
</p>
<p>same time two sorts of money of different grades of excel-
</p>
<p>lency, when the better will cease to be in circulation. The
</p>
<p>hoarding of gold, which has already taken place, indicates
</p>
<p>that we shall not escape the usual experience in such cases.
</p>
<p>So, if this silver coinage be continued, we may reasonably
</p>
<p>expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field of
</p>
<p>circulation to silver alone. This, of course, must produce
</p>
<p>a severe contraction of our circulating medium, instead of

</p>
<p>adding to it."
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>If the President would inform us where to find the history
</p>
<p>which demonstrates that an increased coinage of silver ever
</p>
<p>produced contraction, we might be able to verify the truth
</p>
<p>of his statement.
</p>
<p>SILVER HAS NOT DRIVEN GOLD FROM THE COUNTRY.
</p>
<p>If the presence of inferior grades of money produce con-
</p>
<p>traction, the retirement of such inferior grades ought to pro-
</p>
<p>duce inflation. If this be so, why not retire greenbacks,
</p>
<p>national bank notes and standard silver dollars, and have
</p>
<p>an abundance of money at once ? There must be some de-
</p>
<p>fect iu the President's historical demonstration as applied
</p>
<p>to the present age, for our experience is contrary to the
</p>
<p>President's history. Greenbacks, national bank notes and
</p>
<p>silver coin have been in circulation for several years.
</p>
<p>Have they contracted the currency? They certainly have
</p>
<p>not thus far driven gold out of the country. On the con-
</p>
<p>trary, the amount of gold in circulation has constantly in-
</p>
<p>creased since the passage of the Act of 1878 providing for
</p>
<p>the coinage of the silver dollar.
</p>
<p>In 1878 the gold and silver coins of the United States
</p>
<p>amounted to about $380,000,000. On July 1, 1885, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the report of the Director of the Mint, the gold and
</p>
<p>silver coins in the United States (including bullion in the
</p>
<p>mints and assay-offices for coinage) amounted to $891,501,-
</p>
<p>682  making an increase of about $510,000,000. Between
</p>
<p>February 28, 1878, and July 1, 1885, the amount of silver
</p>
<p>was increased by coinage by about $210,000,000. Deducting
</p>
<p>the increase of silver from the total increase of both gold
</p>
<p>and silver, shows an increase of gold in the United States
</p>
<p>of about $300,000,000 since the passage of the Act of 1878 
</p>
<p>an average increase of about $3, 448 ,000 a month.
</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRATORS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR OWN WRONG.
</p>
<p>The argument against silver, founded on its present de-

</p>
<p>preciated value as compared with gold, is unfair. It is an
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>attempt on the part of the enemies of silver to take advan-
</p>
<p>tage of their own wrong. When the war on silver com-
</p>
<p>menced, the amount of silver necessary to make a silver
</p>
<p>dollar (as before stated) was Avorth three cents more than
</p>
<p>the amount of gold required to make a gold dollar. The
</p>
<p>combined power of $75,000,000,000 of bonds and twenty-
</p>
<p>seven hundred national banks has depressed the market
</p>
<p>value of silver, as compared with gold, more than 25 per
</p>
<p>cent. The active co-operation of the President and his
</p>
<p>advisers with the bondholders and the national banks has
</p>
<p>depressed the market value of silver since the 4th of March
</p>
<p>last as much as 5 per cent. The President now points to the
</p>
<p>difference in the market value of silver and gold, produced
</p>
<p>by himself and the powers he serves, as a reason why there
</p>
<p>should be no further opposition to the utter demonetization
</p>
<p>of silver, and tlie final consummation of a crime against civ-
</p>
<p>ilization which will entail burdens upon the people too
</p>
<p>grievous to bear.
</p>
<p>CONTEACTION AND THE EFFORT TO DEMONETIZE SILVER THE
</p>
<p>CAUSE OF HARD TIMES.
</p>
<p>It is true that enterprise is at a standstill, and that indus-
</p>
<p>try is paralyzed and millions are unemployed. What has
</p>
<p>caused this deplorable state of affairs? It is not inflation, be-
</p>
<p>cause now is a time of contraction. According to the "Amer-
</p>
<p>ican Almanac" for 1885, there was an increase of the amount
</p>
<p>of money in actual circulation among the people, between
</p>
<p>November 1, 1879. and November 1, 1882, of about $118,- .
</p>
<p>000,000. This increase substantially corresponded with the
</p>
<p>ratio of increase of population, and it was a period of great
</p>
<p>prosperity. From November 1, 1882, to November 1, 1884,
</p>
<p>there was a decrease in the currency in circulation among
</p>
<p>the people of about $45,000,000. The decrease in the circu-
</p>
<p>lation from November 1, 1884, to November 1, 1885, we have

</p>
<p>no means of accurately stating, but we know it was much
</p>
<p>greater than in any preceding year. It is safe t say that
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>the amount in actual circulation among the people to-day is
</p>
<p>more than $100,000,000 less than it was three years ago,
</p>
<p>while the demand for circulation has increased with the in-
</p>
<p>crease of population. The "vast army of the unemployed"
</p>
<p>bear witness to the evil effects of this contraction. The pa-
</p>
<p>ralysis of business, produced by contraction, has been ag-
</p>
<p>gravated by the declared purpose of the present administra-
</p>
<p>tion to demonetize silver and contract the world's money to
</p>
<p>the gold standard. Well may capital timidly shrink from
</p>
<p>trade, and investors be unwilling to take the chance of pur-
</p>
<p>chasing property when a promise is made to them by a
</p>
<p>powerful administration that silver shall be demonetized,
</p>
<p>property and labor made cheaper, and gold made dearer.
</p>
<p>Why should not capitalists hoard gold, and refuse to invest
</p>
<p>in property, when the administration proposes to enhance
</p>
<p>the value of money, and depress the price of property.
</p>
<p>EOBBERY IN THE NAJVIE OF PATEIOTISM. *
</p>
<p>The message contains an appeal to the patriotism of the
</p>
<p>country to do an act which would rob the taxpayer and enrich
</p>
<p>the bondholder. The message does not in terms assert that
</p>
<p>the bonded indebtedness of the United States is payable in
</p>
<p>gold alone, but appeals to all good citizens not to pay gold
</p>
<p>obligations in silver. We call particular attention to the
</p>
<p>following remarkable passage in the message :
</p>
<p>"The condition in which our Treasury may be placed by
</p>
<p>a persistence in our present course is a matter of concern to
</p>
<p>every patriotic citizen who does not desire his Government
</p>
<p>to pa}^ in silver such of its obligations as should be paid in
</p>
<p>gold; nor should our condition be suclj as to oblige us, in a
</p>
<p>prudent management of our affairs, to discontinue the call-
</p>
<p>ing in and payment of interest-bearing obligations which
</p>
<p>we have the right now to discharge, and thus avoid the pa}'^-
</p>
<p>ment of further interest thereon."

<p>Whom is the President accusing of bad faith ? Did any
</p>
<p>advocate of silver ever propose to violate the obligation of
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>contracts ? or pay gold obligations in silver ? What does
</p>
<p>the President mean by " such of its obligations as should be
</p>
<p>paid in gold?" If he means the bonded indebtedness of
</p>
<p>the United States, why does he not so declare ? If he can
</p>
<p>show that the people of the United States are under any
</p>
<p>legal or equitable obligation to pa}^ that debt in gold, all
</p>
<p>patriotic citizens will join him in requiring its payment in
</p>
<p>that metal, at any cost. But the President knows very well
</p>
<p>that every dollar of the interest-bearing debt of the United
</p>
<p>States may lawfully be paid in either g'ld or silver.
</p>
<p>The Act authorizing payment in either gold or silver is
</p>
<p>printed on every bond. When the bondholders first put
</p>
<p>forward their jireposterous claim for jDayment in gold alone,
</p>
<p>the Congress of the United States immediately took the
</p>
<p>matter under consideration and passed a concurrent reso-
</p>
<p>lution, after exhaustive debate, which we commend to
</p>
<p>the consideration of the President. The resolution to which
</p>
<p>we refer passed the Senate on the 25th day of January, 1878,
</p>
<p>by a vote of 42 ayes to 20 noes, and was concurred in by the
</p>
<p>House on the 28th day of the same month by a vote of 189
</p>
<p>ayes to 79 noes. It is as follows:
</p>
<p>Whekeas, By the Act entitled "An Act to strengthen the
</p>
<p>public credit," approved March 18, 1869, it was provided
</p>
<p>and declared that the faith of the United States was thereby
</p>
<p>solemnly pledged to the payment, in coin or its equivalent,
</p>
<p>of all the interest-bearing obligations of the United States,
</p>
<p>except in cases where the law authorizing the issue of such
</p>
<p>obligations had exj)ressly provided that the same might
</p>
<p>be paid in lawful money or other currency than gold and
</p>
<p>silver: and
</p>
<p>Whereas, All the bonds of the United States autho-

<p>hereinbefore recited are payable, principal and interest, at
</p>
<p>the option of the Government of the United States, in silver
</p>
<p>dollars, of the coinage of the United States, containing 412|
</p>
<p>grains each of standard silver; and that, to restore to its
</p>
<p>coinage such silver coins as a legal tender in payment of
</p>
<p>said bonds, principal and interest, is not in violation of the

<p>public faith, nor in derogation of the rights of the public

</p>
<p>We ask: What patriotic citizen would again change the con-
</p>
<p>tract between the bondholder and the people and convert an
</p>
<p>obligation payable in silver or gold into a contract for the
</p>
<p>payment of gold alone ? Does the President advocate such
</p>
<p>change? If the change must be made, let it be made
</p>
<p>directly and not indirectly. If there is no respect for the
</p>
<p>obligation of contracts, pass a law for the payment of the
</p>
<p>bonds in gold or platinum, or anything else that the bond-

<p>holder may demand, but do not do it by demonetizing silver
</p>
<p>and depriving the people of a sufficient circulating medium.
</p>
<p>The declaration of the President that he would advocate the
</p>
<p>conversion of contracts payable in silver into contracts pay-
</p>
<p>able in gold has already prostrated the industries of the
</p>
<p>country. What does the President mean by saving that the
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>condition of the Treasury may be such if the coinage of
</p>
<p>silver is not stopped as to oblige us to discontinue to call in
</p>
<p>and pay interest-bearing bonds '? There is a large amount
</p>
<p>of overdue bonds outstanding. Does he mean that there is
</p>
<p>no money in the Treasury with which to pay them, when he
</p>
<p>at the same time reports an enormous surplus of idle money
</p>
<p>incumbering the vaults of the Government? Does he really
</p>
<p>mean that the Treasury officials with his approval will con-
</p>
<p>tinue to refuse to call in and pay bonds in silver according
</p>
<p>to the letter and spirit of the law of July 14, 1870, under
</p>
<p>which they were issued? Is the Chief Executive faithfully
</p>
<p>executing the law when he hoards silver with whicli the
</p>
<p>bonded debt is payable, and allows interest to accumulate
</p>
<p>on overdue bonds? Or is he subserving some interest an-
</p>
<p>tagonistic to the people ?
</p>
<p>THERE ARE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS WHO HATE NO BONDS.
</p>
<p>The allusion of the President to the debtor class is unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate. The intimation that a debtor is dishonest who
</p>
<p>claims the right to pay according to the terms of his con-
</p>
<p>tract is unjust. The President, however, seems to realize
</p>
<p>that the sympathies of mankind may be on the side of the
</p>
<p>toiling ma?;ses, whose burdens must necessarily be increased
</p>
<p>by the enormous contraction which he proposes in the de-
</p>
<p>monetization of silver. To avoid the effect of such sympa-
</p>
<p>thy, and to keep from view the real beneficiaries in the
</p>
<p>scheme to contract the world' s money by the demonetization
</p>
<p>of silver, he puts forward in the place of the Eothschilds
</p>
<p>and the Vanderbilts, poor widows, orphans and helpless
</p>
<p>beneficiaries. He says (if the coinage of silver were con-
</p>
<p>tinued) : 
</p>
<p>"The pittance of the widow and orphan and the incomes
</p>
<p>of helpless beneficiaries of all kinds would be disastrously
</p>
<p>reduced."

</p>
<p>The President seems to forget that there are poor widows
</p>
<p>and orphans who have no bonds. He also ignores the fact
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>that the bonds of the United States are to-day worth three
</p>
<p>times as much as when thej were originally issiied ; that it
</p>
<p>now requires three times the amount of labor to buy a dollar
</p>
<p>in either gold or sih-er that it did in 1863 to buy a dollar in
</p>
<p>United States bonds.
</p>
<p>It is an insult to the intelligence of the people to argue
</p>
<p>that the poor and not the rich are the owners of bonds.
</p>
<p>The President ought to reflect that if the burdens of the
</p>
<p>laborer are increased by the manipulations of bondholders
</p>
<p>and national bank managers the food and clothing of poor
</p>
<p>widows and helpless orphans who have no bonds will be
</p>
<p>' ' disastrously reduced. ' '
</p>
<p>THE "VAST ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED" AEE EARNING NO
</p>
<p>MONEY TO DEPOSIT IN SAVINGS BANKS.
</p>
<p>The President appeals to depositors in savings banks, and
</p>
<p>tells them that if they are not paid in gold, when they de-
</p>
<p>posit paper or silver, they will be wronged. The depos-
</p>
<p>itors in savings banks are laborers. They earned their
</p>
<p>money when there was an abundant circulating medium and
</p>
<p>when the circulation consisted of gold, silver and paper.
</p>
<p>Then the Jjrmy of the unemployed was not vast, and
</p>
<p>did not include millions who were willing to work. The
</p>
<p>depositors in savings banks are honest, and they are satis-
</p>
<p>fied to be paid in the same kind of money which they de-
</p>
<p>posited. They are laborers, and the contraction which the
</p>
<p>demonetization of silver would produce would throw them
</p>
<p>out of employment, and force them to consume their present
</p>
<p>accumulations before good times can come again. No labor-
</p>
<p>ing man desires to increase the bondholder's power, or sub-
</p>
<p>ject himself or his posterity to slavery to enrich a favored
</p>
<p>few. The President ought to know that if silver is demone-
</p>
<p>tized, and the gold standard adopted, there will be no end
</p>
<p>to contraction, no end to depression of business no end to

</p>
<p>CON'SPIFACY TO [MAINTAIN BONDED ARISTOCRACY AND SUBSIDIZED
</p>
<p>BANKS.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that tlie President of the United States is
</p>
<p>really scheming to demonetize silver for the purpose of in-
</p>
<p>creasing the power of the national banks ? Does he really
</p>
<p>intend that the national bank circulation shall take the
</p>
<p>place of silyer, and that millions shall be added to the an-
</p>
<p>nual subsidy which those powerful corporations now receive?
</p>
<p>Why does not the present administration call in the bonds
</p>
<p>that are due, and relieve the Treasury of its surplus revenue?
</p>
<p>Why invent schemes for increasing the expenditures of the
</p>
<p>government, or for reducing its revenues, while unpaid,
</p>
<p>over-due bonds remain subject to call? Why has the
</p>
<p>present administration refused to ap]^ly the surplus in
</p>
<p>the Treasury to the payment of the public debt? Is it
</p>
<p>possible that there is a conspiracy on foot in the interest of
</p>
<p>the national banks and the bondholders to keep the exist-
</p>
<p>ing national debt afloat, and increase it, if possible, so that
</p>
<p>a bonded aristocracy can be maintained in the United States,
</p>
<p>and the national banks furnished with an ample supply of
</p>
<p>United States bonds to enable them to increase the enor-
</p>
<p>mous subsidy which they now enjoy, and maintain permanent
</p>
<p>control of the political as w-ell as the financial power of the
</p>
<p>government? It is manifest from the President's message
</p>
<p>that all patriotic citizens ought to unite in resisting the com-
</p>
<p>bined power of the bondholders and national banks, which
</p>
<p>have for years controlled all national administrations, and
</p>
<p>threaten to subvert the liberties of the people.
</p>
<p>The President's message has spread gloom and apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion over the Pacific Coast. The refusal of the Treasury
</p>
<p>ofl&cials to execute the law of 1878 in good faith was famil-
</p>
<p>iar to the mining States and Territories. They were annoyed
</p>
<p>by the vexatious and arbitrary rules of the Treasury Depart-

</p>
<p>ment, which deprived them of silver as a circulating medium.
</p>
<p>They could see no reason why silver coin needed here could
</p>
<p>not be exchanged for gold by the Sub-Treasury without
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>applying to Wasliington in each case for autlioiity to make
</p>
<p>the exchange; nor could they see why silver coin needed
</p>
<p>here should be shipped to New York or Washington at
</p>
<p>great expense, and withheld from circulation among the
</p>
<p>people. But they did not imagine for a moment that the
</p>
<p>President of the United States was a party to such disreput-
</p>
<p>able transactions. They do not now believe that he is guilty
</p>
<p>of any intentional wrong, but the}' fear what is equally
</p>
<p>disastrous to the best interests of the country, that he is
</p>
<p>misled, deceived and imposed iipon by the unscrupulous
</p>
<p>and artful misrepresentations of the bondholders and
</p>
<p>national banks.
</p>
<p>ilANY WHEAT GROWERS AND COTTOX PLANTERS ESPECIALLY
</p>
<p>INJURED.
</p>
<p>We call the attention of the President to tlie fact, that, in
</p>
<p>addition to the general depression of business and the great
</p>
<p>injustice to the people which would be effected by the de-
</p>
<p>monetization of silver, there are three great industrial
</p>
<p>classes of the United States who would be especially
</p>
<p>injured thereby, to wit: gold and silver miners, cultivators
</p>
<p>of wheat and planters of cotton. The great wheat and
</p>
<p>cotton producing empire of India, with its 250,000,000 of
</p>
<p>population, has silver for- its circulating medium. All pro-
</p>
<p>ducts of India are bought on the silver basis. W^heat and
</p>
<p>cotton are purchased in India with silver and sold in Eu-
</p>
<p>rope for gold. The difference between silver and gold in
</p>
<p>London is about 25 per cent. This difference gives the
</p>
<p>wheat or cotton merchant of India 25 per cent, advantage
</p>
<p>in the European markets over the merchant of the United
</p>
<p>States dealing in those commodities. The rapid accumu-
</p>
<p>lation of the wealth of the merchants of San Francisco who,
</p>
<p>during the civil war, bought goods in the East with green-
</p>
<p>backs worth 50 cents on the dollar in coin, and sold the

</p>
<p>same goods on the Pacific Coast for gold, illustrates the
</p>
<p>advantafje which the merchant of India has when he buys
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>wheat or cotton at home for silver, and sells it in Europe
</p>
<p>for gold.
</p>
<p>The cotton planters of the South and the wheat-growers
</p>
<p>of the Northwest and of the Pacific Coast have suffered in
</p>
<p>their European market for several years by a ruinous com-
</p>
<p>petition with India, resulting from cheap silver anil dear
</p>
<p>gold. If the law of 1878 is repealed and the price of silver
</p>
<p>still further reduced, the advantages of the importer of
</p>
<p>wheat and cotton from India over the importer of the same
</p>
<p>articles from the United States in every European market
</p>
<p>will be greatly increased.
</p>
<p>No one will deny that the demonetization of silver would
</p>
<p>stop silver mining, but the fact that it will also stop one of
</p>
<p>the principal supplies of gold is not generally understood.
</p>
<p>Most of the great silver mines of the world contain a large
</p>
<p>percentage of gold. The average amount of gokbin the ores
</p>
<p>of the Comstock exceeds forty per cent, of their value. If
</p>
<p>silver mining is stopped it will not pay to work the so-called
</p>
<p>silver mines for gold alone. The silver mines will be closed
</p>
<p>down, and a source of supply ^vhich furnishes a large per-
</p>
<p>centage  perhaps one-half  of the annual product of gold
</p>
<p>in the world will be cut ofH.
</p>
<p>Every industry in the United States will be injured by the
</p>
<p>demonetization of silver. The only possible good that has
</p>
<p>been or can be suggested from this attack upon silver is to
</p>
<p>enhance the value of bonds, and furnish an excuse for further
</p>
<p>subsidies to national banks. The government of the United
</p>
<p>States does not exist for these two favored classes alone,
</p>
<p>and the time will come when the people will rise against
</p>
<p>the now apparently overwhelming power of the combination
</p>
<p>of European syndicates and American bankers.
