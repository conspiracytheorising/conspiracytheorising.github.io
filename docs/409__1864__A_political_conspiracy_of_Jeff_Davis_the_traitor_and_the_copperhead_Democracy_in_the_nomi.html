</p>
<p>SECTION I.
</p>
<p>THE AGED CHAPLIN'S ADDRESS TO THE READER
</p>
<p>Loyal Americans ;
</p>
<p>We eome before you not as a politician, nor as a religious polemic-
</p>
<p>We come before you to beg a hearing on a subject, not only of the deep-
</p>
<p>est interest to us as a partnership in one Federal union of btatcs, but
</p>
<p>involving, as we verily believe, the existence of our liberties, and
</p>
<p>the perpetuity of our republic. ^  . , ;i + i oi
</p>
<p>In the treasonable political party theory of "independent loca
</p>
<p>State rights," as these are characterized by the leaders of rebeUion at
</p>
<p>the South, and by a disorganizing party claimmg_ to be the orthodox
</p>
<p>democracy of the North, we have detected an mvadmg, audacious
</p>
<p>conspiracy, under the mask of " sacred State rights" against the lib-
</p>
<p>erties of our country : we have dragged it forward into the light ; we
</p>
<p>have stripped the visor off its face ; and have brought it up to your
</p>
<p>tribunal for public judgment in case.
</p>
<p>So far as our capacity of reasoning can extend, we pronounce it a
</p>
<p>treasonable party political invention : a policy mostly of loreigii ori-
</p>
<p>e-in  foreign in its support, and in its allegiance, and is having abane-
</p>
<p>ful influence to sunder all that union nationality contemplated m the
</p>
<p>Constitution left to posterity by our fathers, to annul civii^ lav, to va-
</p>
<p>cate the Presidential chair, to annihilate Congress, to dissolve our Cab-
</p>
<p>inet to palsy our military arm ! and to gratify its lust of treasonable
</p>
<p>ambitivm, it has thrown this glorious republic into a war ot human
</p>
<p>slaughter. It has waged this war for the extermination of this repub-
</p>
<p>lican government and the sacred liberties of man. It has compelled
</p>
<p>its slaves at the South to grasp the hammer of treason and rivet
</p>
<p>stronger their chains, while its Northern army, foreign and domestic
</p>
<p>are Iield in veneration for their loyalty to the great bloody counterleit
</p>
<p>"Stat.-> rio-hts^' theory. Indeed this treasonable dogma aims at uni-
</p>
<p>versal power over the property, the bodies and souls of all men withm
</p>
<p>the reach of its disloyal, arbitrary, avaricious arm, and its historj pi

</p>
<p>fire and blood, and reckless oppression, to annihilate by war, by this
</p>
<p>war of barbarism, the last vestige of civil liberty, and to degrade the
</p>
<p>North Ainerican character in view of the nations, can be nmie other
</p>
<p>than anarcljy, emboldened and led onward by such despotic champi-
</p>
<p>ons as Jefferson Duvis, James Buchanan, Vallandigham, Horatio, and
</p>
<p>also one Mr. Fernando A. Woodemnan, notorious for liis loyally U, tiie
</p>
<p>chief bloody Despot of a confederacy of traitors.
</p>
<p>^^'e thi-refore say, that so far as these sons of Belial sliall reach the
</p>
<p>power which they lust after in this land, they will enact upon freemen
</p>
<p>and Iree institutions more bloody scenes than tlieNew York July anti-
</p>
<p>enrollment riots, or the indiscriminate massacre of oui surrendered
</p>
<p>])risoners of war.
</p>
<p>It is in view of these impending disorders, which are over at-
</p>
<p>tendant on anarchy and despotic rule, that makes us feel desir-
</p>
<p>ous to impress on the mind ot the loyal reader that, of all human
</p>
<p>institutions. States are of the slowest growth, and re(|uire the deepest
</p>
<p>root. To be permanent they must be founded in the habits and cus-
</p>
<p>toms of the people. Like a statue they cannot be brought into exist-
</p>
<p>ence by edict or decree nor by anarchy Far away from these arbi-
</p>
<p>trary elements, their laws must be founded in the institutions of social
</p>
<p>life, and penetrate the business and pure conscientious bosoms of
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>As a nation we are entering on a new state of free existence, in the
</p>
<p>very land once the home of our fathers, in the same land now crim-
</p>
<p>soned by means of anarchy, and from whence thousands of Union mar-
</p>
<p>tyrs' soldier spirits arc fled npward during this unholy secession war I
</p>
<p>We say to onr countrymen, yes, in the same land, where the mortal of
</p>
<p>the conscientiously brave are fallen But then, we should regard the
</p>
<p>blood of the Union soldier martyr a precious seed; because his dust,
</p>
<p>even m death's dormitory, has made Federal union soil sacred for all
</p>
<p>future time. Indeed, the events of the hour are verily now, sugges-
</p>
<p>tive that, since the inauguration of the American Nation's Executive
</p>
<p>Chief, in one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the W(.rk of a cen-
</p>
<p>tury has already been achieved. "We have w"'atchcd with no ordinary
</p>
<p>interest, the pregnant events of this national struggle, from th fall of

<p>the New York July anti-enrollment riots, and day by day and lnuirby
</p>
<p>hour, we have beheld a degraded counterfeit " State rights " copper-
</p>
<p>head army at the North, and their vidsfers, a uniform, bloodv, confed-
</p>
<p>eracy at the South, receding, until more than half the t(>rritory cov-
</p>
<p>ered by the rebel flag at the beginning of the war, has fallen into pos
</p>
<p>sessKjn of the Government, and is covered by the star.'< and stripe.^, the"
</p>
<p>emblem of liberty now and forever We have beheld armed anarchy
</p>
<p>spreading her revolutionary "State right" c(mnterfeit bloody ft.lds in
</p>
<p>* J^''"'tl'iT' Christian city, and hands stained in human gore tearing
</p>
<p>the l^in'on banner in a thousand pieces. "\Ve have beJield our quiet
</p>
<p>citizens fleeing and being pursued before a political party that were
</p>
<p>determined to rule and never to obey, burning, robbing, and shedding
</p>
<p>liuman blood. And again we have seen a great city become a quiet
</p>
<p>home by means of the power of the grape and canister, discharged by
</p>
<p>Potomac veferan soldiers, that were hurried in multitudes from the
</p>
<p>war batlh; ll<ld to put down a political party, and a jiarty, too, that
</p>
<p>were in an alliance of sympathy with the great Southern treason.
</p>
<p>We suggest to the reader that we have passed the years of three
</p>
<p>score and uineteen. During this Latter period we have beheld this
</p>
<p>Northern arm of the rebellion retreating and shifting from side to
</p>
<p>side  sometimes professing to be heart and soul Union men, then
</p>
<p>seeming to be delirious, rattling in the throat and wishing they had
</p>
<p>never been born : then revived and being comforted at any defeat of
</p>
<p>our naval and military arm. And again we have seen a statesman, a
</p>
<p>most eloquent stickler for the State right counterfeit currency become
</p>
<p>alarmed in view of a fatal epidemic, in the entire army of Northern an-
</p>
<p>archy, we have beheld that reckless man acting as a physician, feeling
</p>
<p>the pulse, and speaking kind words of "friendship" to his entire army
</p>
<p>of desperadoes, assuring every man a remedy by means of his Assist-
</p>
<p>ant General, when these innocent offending creatures should inimedi-
</p>
<p>ately become convalescent. , r. , x- .1 r
</p>
<p>It is therefore in view, of the drying up ot the Euphrates ot the ioe
</p>
<p>to freedom at the South, and withering the sympathizing arm of anai^
</p>
<p>chy at the North, of States once degraded being regenerated, and
</p>
<p>apportioning freedom to every man, we say^ how solemnly important
</p>
<p>must be the re-election of the sound statesman now at our Republican
</p>
<p>National helm. But, this requires capacity, devotion, and purpose.
</p>
<p>It must be done by the people, and not under the dictation of men in
</p>
<p>sympathy with the great Southern treason. It must be done by in-
</p>
<p>voking the blessing of Cxod Almighty, upon the approaching National
</p>
<p>Vay, when freemen shall prove to traitors that they love their country
</p>
<p>,s a seat of laws, a mild, wise and happy government, in the very
</p>
<p>land where repose the mortal of our forefathers. Here our tender in-
</p>
<p>fancy was reared with care. Here, our innocent children sported.
</p>
<p>Here our careless youth grew up amid companions and friends. Here
</p>
<p>our dearest connections were formed, and here our fathers of the ever
</p>
<p>memorable, glorious Revolution toiled, and groaned, and bled,^ and
</p>
<p>died, leaving as their legacies for us their children, this entire Union
</p>
<p>of States, as one sovereign nationality, never to be sundered by
</p>
<p>It is, however, none other but the God of armies who demands pen-
</p>
<p>itence 'for national wickedness. But the repentance of a nation does
</p>
<p>not consist in a bare attention to present disorders. It requires us to

</p>
<p>go back to the times of our revolutionary ancestors, and to examine
</p>
<p>whether we be now suffering by means of their imperfections. We
</p>
<p>may flatter ourselves that we are not responsible for any of the errors
</p>
<p>of our forefathers, but provided we are becoming rich by cherishing
</p>
<p>their defects, or holding as sacred what they have framed wiiich sanc-
</p>
<p>tions oT^-oTPssion, we must be a'^coimtable fo^ any oud every vice they
</p>
<p>have entailed; although the Governor of New York, the doctor of
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, may demand the bowing of every knee to their divid-
</p>
<p>ing theory of " constitutional rights."
</p>
<p>It is on this account the justice of God threatens to involve us with
</p>
<p>national punishment. Yes, verily, all the blood shed in this treason-
</p>
<p>able rebellion shall be required at the hands of its conspirators, and
</p>
<p>of those in sympathy with anarchy, to aid the great Southern trea-
</p>
<p>sonable insurrection.
</p>
<p>This should be a dreadful thought, for the Governor of a loyal
</p>
<p>State. A dreadful thought, to freemen who are to legislate as the
</p>
<p>reprcsontatives of a groat republic. A di-cadful thong-ht for our Un-
</p>
<p>ion statesuK'n, generals, soldiers, and citizens. A dreadful tliouglit
</p>
<p>for tlie cru'd and the e.varicious who have coninieuced this bloody
</p>
<p>robelboii. Dreadful thoMirht, thao they must iiiiierit all the punish-
</p>
<p>ment lir t!io defects ui the fat'nera. rueadud ihought, wiien God
</p>
<p>shall nii.K in one cup of woo, the sins of the children w ith those of
</p>
<p>their preilecessors, and cliain to tliis and future g'eneratif)ns the enor-
</p>
<p>mities of the present and the past 1 Dreadful thought, that this He-
</p>
<p>public is now shaking from center to circumference, and the petitions
</p>
<p>of many a Most'S are refused by those; tenderdieartccl disei])les of the
</p>
<p>meek aiid lowly, who are ])lcased wilii coerced ial)or from tlie defence-
</p>
<p>less poor, and practice city mob riots to aid the gnMt .Southern rebel-
</p>
<p>lion. Dreadful thought, that we must rear armies and navies to d(>-
</p>
<p>fend life, property, the honor of the nation, and moreover that the
</p>
<p>price of freedom must once more be the blood of our countrymen.
</p>
<p>Dreadfid thought, that the Southern Confederacy have drawn a bloody,
</p>
<p>avaricious sword, which refuses to return to its scabbard, and seems
</p>
<p>desirous that ours, the land of liberty, should be one vast sepulchre.
</p>
<p>\Ve have, in times tliat are passed, listened with a sort of cool in-
</p>
<p>difference to tlio calamities of Europe, not so much as drcaniing such
</p>
<p>horrors might be our own. In order to remove them, now they tire
</p>
<p>come, let us humble ourselves while looking up to the Supreme Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty who has said "oi what i aslant I shall fpciJc cnnccrni.i'O a nation,
</p>
<p>to ]>iill dcuv'i and destroy >t, if that nation turn from their evil I ici 1 1 repent
</p>
<p>of ihe evil J thouf/ht to do unto them." Wc announce to the reader that
</p>
<p>this is the method which God now proposes as a condition of Ins favor,
</p>
<p>of the peace of the nation, the perpetuity of our republic, and of the
</p>
<p>retention of the entire old Federal Union homestead unimpaired. This
</p>
<p>is the method of Divine Avisdom, proposed to all conflicting parties in
</p>
<p>this war of bretliren, and which is a method of peace. ^Vclnust \yivt
</p>
<p>away from the nation ' the evil " which has been the cause of this
</p>
<p>rebellion, whatever that evil may be. And provided it be cruelty,
</p>
<p>enthusiasm, or coveteousncss, it must be annihilated : then, and not
</p>
<p>till then, shall we, as a nation, have the protection of the AlmiglUy.

<p>Deliuiliuu oi ;bo three foims of Natioxiul JSoveruignty, nml the inconvoniences
</p>
<p>of each.
</p>
<p>Loyal Americans :
</p>
<p>It is our purpose, in this department, to define the orig'in of society,
</p>
<p>and to portray the motives which induce men to create govermnent.
</p>
<p>Each of mankind has wants to be supplied, as dependent creatures
</p>
<p>one upon the other. He needs the meaus of knowledge, of laws to
</p>
<p>IDrotect him, of property for his support, of medicines to relieve pain,
</p>
<p>of aliments to nourish his frail tabernacle, and of clothiug to shelter
</p>
<p>him against the severity of the changing seasons. It is, hence, simi-
</p>
<p>lar wants produce the same design. Therefore, different men unite,
</p>
<p>that the industry of all may suppl}' what may be needful to each.
</p>
<p>That they may enjoy the blessing they desire, some lixed articles of
</p>
<p>government must be obeyed. They feci their natural equality. They
</p>
<p>promise mutually to succour and relieve each other ; to be ever sin-
</p>
<p>cere, and to utter none other but truth ; to regard the happiness of all
</p>
<p>above the interest of one, aud that in cases of private and public in-
</p>
<p>terest, that of the iiuNic shall predominate.
</p>
<p>This is a societ}^ furmed on tiie principles of rectitude, which teaches
</p>
<p>men their natural equality ; that they arc an origin from the same
</p>
<p>dust, have the same Creator, and are doomed to the same last end.
</p>
<p>This is a loyal national rectitude, which teaches all men to be just.
</p>
<p>That we should render tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to
</p>
<p>whom custom, and honor to whom honor is due. That " whatever we
</p>
<p>would have others do to us, we should do even so to them." This
</p>
<p>is a rectitude requiring us to be animated with charity to each other ;
</p>
<p>to regard good men as heirs of the same terrestrial and immortal
</p>

<p>But then it is inconvenient for the members of a society in a large
</p>
<p>territory to meet for legislative purposes, nor can ihej, in this man-
</p>
<p>ner, conveniently give their suffrages. Public bodies regard it as
</p>
<p>wise and convenient to elect some of their number, to act as legisla-
</p>
<p>tors, and to clothe these with authority in all matters appertaining to
</p>
<p>Government.
</p>
<p>The forms of national government ainmig men severally adopted,
</p>
<p>are, Moitarchy, A R-pubiic i^that is a Uepreseutative Administration,)
</p>
<p>and Democraci/, which Js a popular Ilcvoiutionary Sovereignty.
</p>
<p>There could bo no objection whatev.-r to either of tiiese forms of na-
</p>
<p>tional rule, provided moral perfection wore universal. But as history
</p>
<p>and also experience affii-m the contrary, wo proceed to portray the
</p>
<p>inconveniences attendant on each of these several fornis of national
</p>
<p>Government rule ; and
</p>
<p>First.  It is fatal to a nation's felicity, when a monarch thinks him-
</p>
<p>self clothed with power for his own elevation, and not for the glory of
</p>
<p>liis king-dom. When ho adopts arbitrary measures to dispose of the
</p>
<p>lives and jjioperty of his subjects. When he satiates his thirst for
</p>
<p>vrn-;vance and ^flury by a waste of liis people in foreign battle fields.
</p>
<p>When lii- butchers his subjects by heedin<r the advice of a rash coun-
</p>
<p>sellor, and has no humane eniotinns for the distresses of the widow
</p>
<p>and the orphan. Yea, when lie wislies all the nei-^-hborin,<;- nations
</p>
<p>were one h.-ad, that he niig-ht sunder all Governments except his own,
</p>
<p>with one fatal blow.
</p>
<p>A second form of (Government, denominated a Republic, becomes
</p>
<p>hurtful when any one of the senntors, representatives, or magistrates,
</p>
<p>f 'rgettinir that he is an individual member, strives to be at the head
</p>
<p>of every department of State. When he intrudes into office, by what-
</p>
<p>ever is too mean to be mentioned before a virtuous peo])le. When he
</p>
<p>uses his jiower, not from a principle of public regard, but rather
</p>
<p>for the advancement of his inditical party, or fainily. \\'heu he
</p>
<p>is so meanly avarici(Mis for gold that he will sell his vot(\ When he
</p>
<p>is a syiniiathizer with a cruel intestine rebellious faction, forming strat-
</p>
<p>agems tor the overthrow of the Republic ; and also when he ever
</p>
<p>makes himself judge in his own cause.
</p>
<p>Moreover, a popular Government, denominated a Democran/, be-
</p>
<p>comes impaired and hurtful, when intrigue and cabal give eflect to
</p>
<p>evil counsels ; and when a powerful faction o]:)press the virtuous few.
</p>
<p>When laws are made and repealed, fnuu principles of levity, other-
</p>
<p>wise for tlie opprossicm of tlie human kind. When popular liberty de-
</p>
<p>generates into anarchy and licentiousness. like that of tlie French na-
</p>
<p>tion, Snith America, Mexico, and the bloody anti-Enrollment Riots, to
</p>
<p>favor the great Southern Treason, in the city of New York ever
</p>
<p>memorable as the anti-war peace party anti-enrollment riots. When a
</p>
<p>popular revolutionary sovereign people deny freedom and right to
</p>
<p>ev(My sane being of human origin  we say, when these crimes exist,
</p>
<p>and are also deemed secured by constitutional law, the enormities of
</p>
<p>the many become an evil, equally appalling as the tyrainiy of one.
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>carry out any real idea o( democracy, has not tieen an act of revolution ? More than
</p>
<p>thirty years ago, the State of Ge.iifiia resi-led the decisioh oflhe Supreme Court in
</p>
<p>the Cherok-e rase, and tin- Democrat c Administration submitted to a fundamental
</p>
<p>volution, tti tlie diclaliim of (ifor'/i;'. .\ short lime after, South Ci<rol;na sent forth

</p>
<p>miee, which, in fat, placed the (iovernm.;nl at the feet uf South Can.liua, ami laid
</p>
<p>the f.iuiulalion of the present war. A few years aft -r Texas was annexed, without
</p>
<p>the sllKhtvHi coii.-titutional authority, or ihe'idea of Democratic sovercifjiity ; and
</p>
<p>now we have, in this bloodv aid rerohitionary war. the ri^lit win,' -A' tht D muer.ilic

</p>
<p>under i'our Seymours, Wood-, and Valla^jdich im-, sayin- aa nnuh as thf>y can to
</p>
<p>help thorn. Wood, who is the true representative of Democracy, and ought to be ita
</p>
<p>candidate for the Presidency, has his speeches in Coni;;res8 quoted in the lebel Con-
</p>
<p>gress as orthodox doctrine. Now, these are the legitimate consequences of a princi-
</p>
<p>ple which is in its very nature, revolutionary. Nor has Governor Seymour failed to
</p>
<p>announce, in the case of Vallandigham'g arrest by the Government, that '' the time
</p>
<p>for rfvolution has already arrived."
</p>
<p>A State is the people united into one body or community for the purpose of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. Sovereignty is an attribute of Government. These forms become living
</p>
<p>bodies, by virtue of the sovereignty imparted to them by the people. The United
</p>
<p>States Government is the supreme State to which all the people owe primary al-
</p>
<p>legiance. When a State of the Union becomes subversive of the ends for whi^ii it was
</p>
<p>created, or sei'ks, by virtue of the sovereignty with which it has been invested, to
</p>
<p>bnng the people in conflict with the supreme sovereignty to which they owe primary
</p>
<p>allegiance, or when such state government becomes abrogated or destroyed by any
</p>
<p>means, the sovereignty with wh'ch it was invested returns to the people, to be ex-
</p>
<p>ercised by them de nova, and such State ceases to exist as a State of the Union.
</p>
<p>This contest is war, and all the rules of war state, among the rights of the conqueror
</p>
<p>is the right to dictate to the conquered the form of Government they shall adopt.
</p>
<p>The States, in their Corporate capacity, may be treated as fo'^eign enemies, but the
</p>
<p>people, in respect to their allegiance to the national Government, must be considered
</p>
<p>and treated as domestic enemies.
</p>
<p>It. could be sl;own, that by no mrn have the " rights of the States," even on their
</p>
<p>own shallow theory, been more seriously assailed than by those who have made ihe
</p>
<p>loude:^t profession of being their special defenders. If we are ?^ partnership merely,
</p>
<p>there could not be a more direct wrong to the non-consenting members, than the
</p>
<p>forcing upon tnem a new partner, wholly foreign to the original articles. Such wag
</p>
<p>the gross infringement of State rights in the annexation of Texas, and the still great-
</p>
<p>er outrage proposed in the purchase of Cuba. Again, if each State is a sovereign,
</p>
<p>what higher rigbt could it possess than that of making citizens? But how contemptu-
</p>
<p>ously was this treated in the partisan Dred Scott decision? State made citizenship
</p>
<p>was citizenship nowhere, whilst, to favor a sectional interest, that much lower thing,
</p>
<p>State-made property, though of a kind opposed to the ideas of the whole civilized
</p>
<p>world, was declared to be property everywhere. And so, too of State representation,
</p>
<p>in the United Mates Senate, of all others, that feature in our Constitution which seems
</p>
<p>purely Federal  how has it been assailed ol late, because it seemed to favor New

</p>
<p>England ? We have seen this in the same newspaper column that was teeming with
</p>
<p>its intemperate advocacj' of State rights. Such shocking inconsistency shows that
</p>
<p>the doctrine, as commonly held, never had any ground ot principle, that it was never
</p>
<p>anything else than the handy weapon of a miserable party expediency.
</p>
<p>But let us vi'w the question in its higher and broader aspects. Tht re are " Rights
</p>
<p>of the States," doubtless, as there are also rights of cities and towns. Among them is
</p>
<p>one that stands out pre-eminently  higher than all others, deeper than all others.
</p>
<p>It is the right of these States in one another. It is the right of each State in the
</p>
<p>whole, and in eveiy other State. Ttiis is, indeed, a precious * State right," far more
</p>
<p>valuable, far more glorious than any claim of petty indepindeiice.
</p>
<p>Now, the sectional worlds are the " chivalry of the souih^" the 'bold sons of the
</p>
<p>^Test," as sometimes arrayed against the canting' puritanism of th; East," Let that
</p>
<p>other day come, and soon may we expect the rights of the " Jersey Oystermen,' or the
</p>
<p>'Chesapeake clam-gatherers," or -'the free mineisof Mauch Chunk," or the in-
</p>
<p>domitable tar-burners of ^orth Carolina," or last, ibiugh not least, ' the unterrified
</p>
<p>L'emocracy of the Five Points," In proportion as all above grows loose, asincv-
</p>
<p>ital-.y lau.ji, be tLi.' cabi, wh^u the ijendiiijj kej of the arch is gone) &u surel^' would
</p>
<p>all below give way, and spread apart, sinking ever lower and lower, to the level of
</p>
<p>small r and meaner interests. The great national band is all that saves us from such
</p>
<p>a state of things ; but this band has much to resist, and should, therefore, be of
</p>
<p>crrespoading strength. The worst of all traitors, the greatest enemies of the
</p>
<p>true ' Stat; rights," have been those politicians who. for the past fifty years, have
</p>
<p>done all th'^y could to weaken it, and now unbiushiugly claim that they are the
</p>
<p>only men that can restore the national health.
</p>
<p>V^'"e now make an appeal to every sane vnter at the approaching
</p>
<p>Presidential Election, and ask, if this proposition of the C(rpperhead
</p>
<p>DoniocrRcy, by means of George H. McClellan, be not the very sublime
</p>
<p>of impadeuce ?
</p>

</p>
<p>Souiid reasons why Abraham Lincoln should ')'> Re-lected President of the United
</p>
<p>State.', iu November 18 J4, and Georj^^- B. McClel.aa rejected.
</p>
<p>LovAL Americans :
</p>
<p>We sugg-st n tiling new .vlii ti Wf; aniuiuuce t'lat, in the approaching
</p>
<p>N )v<'nibfr, 1864, an El- ction of some one of our citizfc.ns is to take place
</p>
<p>thrDUghout the entire not-seceded American nation. The next man to
</p>
<p>fill the Piesedential chair will be George B. McClellan, or Abraham Lin-
</p>
<p>coln. The private opinions of the candidates are of nninor moment.
</p>
<p>The principles of the respective pHrtiv\<? are of the greatest importance to
</p>
<p>this bleeding community. Should General McClellan be the successful
</p>
<p>aspirer for power, bis peace party will manage him as they did on the
</p>
<p>Potomac  as the do now  and as the rebels did ex-President, Buchanan.
</p>
<p>We now affirm that Jeff Davis and Abraham Lincoln both speak the
</p>
<p>same sentiment, that slavery is not the point at issue in this bloody con-
</p>
<p>test. Davis declares that he -s protracting this war against our Gov
</p>
<p>ernment and Constitution for a recognition of his Confederacy as an in-
</p>
<p>dependent nation, otherwise that lie will fight until every male citizen of
</p>
<p>the South is annihila:,. d. Abraham Lincoln, on the other side, as the
</p>
<p>elected chief of this Republic, is in command of a powerful army, and
</p>
<p>navy that are fighting to r.;'.ain a Union and tenitovy bequeathed to all
</p>
<p>future posterity by the fathers of 1776; otherwise purchased by the
</p>
<p>treasure of the republic, to be, and to rem lin, tlie property of a majority
</p>
<p>of the people  which, in our republic comprise this American nation.
</p>
<p>Davis, as a bloody traitor, is c iispiring and warring to destroy our Con-
</p>
<p>stitution. Lincoln, as a patriot and tather to [ osterity, is adopting all
</p>
<p>loyal means warranted by our Constitution, to save that Constitution un-
</p>
<p>impaired. ; to Hdove out of the way what has been the cause of the

</p>
<p>rebellion, and we say, tliat he admits of no compromise whatever with
</p>
<p>treason. Davis fights desperately, that he may be an example (or a con-
</p>
<p>tinual secession of the States, until our nation's Constitution has no
</p>
<p>subjects to obey it. On the other hand, Lincoln holds up the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, as the precious price of noble, loyal, patriotic blood, shed freely by
</p>
<p>their fathers, to procure an American legacy in one national stock, never
</p>
<p>to be sundered ; as iht- b,i>i.s ef order, of obedience, of liberty, and the
</p>
<p>nation's elevati(;ii.
</p>
<p>Our latheis when they ir.iide the Constitution, tl ought they coiihl trust it to the
</p>
<p>intijllisiGnce. the virtue, the patriotism of 'he Ami'rican peopio, to appoint their own
</p>
<p>Prtsiuiin from time to tinif. Wei!, iu ^ 810, iu the due course of our politic il his-

<p>tory, the American people exercised the riuht of performing that high duty com-
</p>
<p>mitted to them by the Coustitution. They elected Abraham Lincoln to be President
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>of tlie United State?. Thf^y did it fnirly. They did it after a full and complete
</p>
<p>cauvHs.'j of all the issue involves. All H)e\>tatcs of the Uiiion, and all ihe people of
</p>
<p>all the States, as fir as we can jiid^e. took part in that content, and voted lor the
</p>
<p>ni-n niioin they resp-clivfly pref ried. Wliat \va< the result".' By a coiistit\itional
</p>
<p>majority  ISO electors out o' 252 Abraham l.incoln was ch<jseii President. For the
</p>
<p>drst time in the history of tlii- counlry---aiid I tru,t it will be the last --a iiortimi of
</p>
<p>th')>e who supported the defeated candidate, hreckinridire, raised the st ndard ot
</p>
<p>levoW, And for four years they have Iteen trying to ti^iht it out on that line. If
</p>
<p>thei rcandidate had l)een ehcti'd we would have heeu n qiircd to actpiiesce, hut for
</p>
<p>four years they hav( been tryinjr to prevent Lincoln from bein<; President of the
</p>
<p>United States, and they have prevented him from brint? President of the wh<'le United
</p>
<p>S'tat. s up to t'.ie present time. It is an attempt to overthrow the Constitution and
</p>
<p>Go ernment. Therefore the issue Is wheih'T a majority of Ihe .\merican people can
</p>
<p>or Fhall til ct thi-ir Pn-^-ident or wheiher they .-h'lll submit to a minoiiij-. The deci-
</p>
<p>Mon of that question dipcnds upon the remit of the present cntite-t. The conven-
</p>
<p>ti II at Baltimore decided to nominate a President afrain. and resolved tiia it they
</p>
<p>had to h^ht for his election they w.inldhfrht for if. 'I hey resol eil that this rebellion
</p>
<p>should be crushed by foice so lon<r s it should continue and that the .'upremacy of
</p>
<p>the Constitution should be maintaiiieil. They nominated precisely the man that the
</p>
<p>minority has been endenvorinpr to ))revent being I'resiihiit after being duly elected.
</p>
<p>Th(' other portion of the people who met at Chicago, after full deiiberatifn, took
</p>
<p>their stand, I'ut how did they meet the issue? They sf<id ro'hing about the right
</p>
<p>of the n,ajority to have their President, and of the minority to submit nothing
</p>
<p>airainst the rebellion. Tl at. certainly, was significant. It was no accident, the
</p>
<p>omission of so rital a point. This silence betniyed their sympathies with the re-
</p>
<p>tiellioii. .Many of them did not hesitate to manif(st their Ixdief that the >el)els were
</p>
<p>in the light, but they did not dare to afflrm it in so many \xords, because they want-
</p>
<p>ed vote.s for the candidate of their ])arty. They resolved that the wai o'ight to he

</p>
<p>we had failed so far, so much the more reason (or renewed efforts. While that con-
</p>
<p>vention was sittiuj;, Atlanta was being taken. Already we have conquered and
</p>
<p>secured three-quarters ol the lebid territory. Our Cenerals tell us that their last

</p>
<p>CleliHn, somehow, saluted our Presideut with a kiss of masked loyalty, as
</p>
<p>did Jud;;s Iscariot, in the by<rone days But then, there was surely no
</p>
<p>mask whatever ill any conference with Jefferson Davis, nor with the Cop-
</p>
<p>perhead Democracy ; but tiie epidemic perils which he inflicted on the
</p>
<p>Potomac Army, which did contribute to encourage treason, and also
</p>
<p>weaken our military strength. He is now doing the same thing, by-
</p>
<p>wrapping himself with the attire of the Copperhead, anti-war Demncracy,
</p>
<p>and consenting to be their candidate for the highest office of the nation,
</p>
<p>that he may so palsy the arm of Lincoln as shall preveat a faitber flog-
</p>
<p>ging of the rebels back to their loyalty.
</p>
<p>But now we hare in Sherman and in Grant an exhibition of military
</p>
<p>tenacity of purpose unexampled in the History of any slow, disobedient ,
</p>
<p>General, The great chaiacteristic of the Lieutenant Commander of the
</p>
<p>army from which George B. McClellan was relieved, is, that when he
</p>
<p>h 'S failed in one thing, he attempts ano her, and thus he continues until
</p>
<p>success crowns his efforts. But notiinig like this can ornament the na-
</p>
<p>tion's historic page, as a laurel of faithfulness and valor, to be awarded
</p>
<p>to George B. McClellan, the Co[)perhead nominee to fill tiie Presidential
</p>
<p>chair, and who did comparatively nothing, except to waste away his
</p>
<p>army, but not ia the battle field. It seems to have been his single pur-
</p>
<p>pose to please his ani-war party, a northern wing of a confederate army
</p>
<p>of traitors ; and these continue to venerate his generaJship, because, un-
</p>
<p>der the mask of loyalty, he swoie he would " drive every rebel to the
</p>
<p>wall ; '' and hence he is now their nominee, as a reward for his patriotic
</p>
<p>dereliction.
</p>
<p>We sug-gest to loyal Americans, that we have put in nomination
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, who has, for three years, been President of so much of
</p>
<p>the United States as his armies have been able to hold for him to preside
</p>
<p>over; and we may, verily, affirm, they hold this, and this only for him
</p>
<p>still, at the point of the bayonet. We are, however, gaining, step by
</p>
<p>step, from time to time, and before his present term expires, we verily
</p>
<p>believe, while we confide in the God of nations, that he will actually be
</p>
<p>President of the whole United States.
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln is again presented to the people of the United States

<p>for their suffrages, because, he is the faithful man again.st whom the rebels
</p>
<p>made their assault on the Constitution with a determination that he should
</p>
<p>not be President of the United States, althougli a majority of the people
</p>
<p>affirmed by their votes at the ballot here, that he should be President of
</p>
<p>the whole United States.
</p>
<p>At Baltimore, the convention accepted that issue fairly and sqnarelv,
</p>
<p>even while the rebels were fighting to put Abraham Lincoln out of the
</p>
<p>Presidential chair, and their sympathizing northern wing aiding as co-
</p>
<p>workers in the cause of treason, to support a candidate for the nation's
</p>
<p>chie*, who, though, at one time, a commander of the army of the Poto-
</p>
<p>mac, did nothing that should displease the anti- war-democracy ever alive
</p>
<p>with emotions of horror at the thought that a confederacy of traitors is
</p>
<p>being coerced to obedience by military force.
</p>
<p>We therefore say, could the bleaching bones of the nation's dead
</p>
<p>soldiers speak from their dormitory, not from their graves, because,
</p>
<p>these had none as a memorial in the putrid swamps of the Chicka-
</p>
<p>hominy, they would suggest a mournful story at the polls, in November
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>1804 ; nor could these fail to advise our newly enlisted M'arriors to
</p>
<p>reijudiato Georg-e B. M'Clellan's cruel presumption in tiiejry and
</p>
<p>practice, which compelled thciu not to fight the rebels, but rather to
</p>
<p>sicken and die, far away from a beloved wife, a father, and children,
</p>
<p>in a i|uagmire of pits and snares, whither they were driven, but wliere
</p>
<p>their commander dared not venture to stay, nor afford them a burial.
</p>
<p>Did our Constitution admit widows and nrplians to vc)te for a Pres-
</p>
<p>ident at the coining election, tlicse would crowd in multitudes at the
</p>
<p>polls, not to put Lincoln out of his chair, but rather to defeat the elec-
</p>
<p>tion of a man these affirm guilty of the blood of their husbands and
</p>
<p>fathers. Moreover, could tlie entire Rebel South procure the defeat
</p>
<p>of Abraham Lincoln, now the nominee for a re-election, for four future
</p>
<p>years, by giving their suffrages to George H. .McClellan, tliey would
</p>
<p>rush to the aid of Vallandigliam, Horatio Seymour, and the equally
</p>
<p>treacherous Woods, in g-rcater nuinbcrs.
</p>
<p>" I noed not recill the dark threatening affairs in the Winter of 1860 '61. A
</p>
<p>long-planned, deep-laid conspiracy, about to break upon the land, with ail the hor-
</p>
<p>ross ot civil war. I'atriots saw the tornado coming, saw the traitors plotting and
</p>
<p>planning the destruction of the Government, disarming and plundering ii, binding
</p>
<p>it, preparing it to fall an easy victim into the Lands of traitors, and yi.t had no
</p>
<p>mvans to resist, because all its machinery was in the hands of traitors. How im-
</p>
<p>patiently and fearfully they waited for th; 4lh of March all will remember. The
</p>
<p>I'residi-ut elect Mt the oppressive weight of r'?pon>ibllity resting upon him. There
</p>
<p>is not a more simple, touching and beautiful sjieech iu the English language than
</p>
<p>that whicti he uttered to hii nrighbors from the platform of the rail-car, ou bidding
</p>
<p>a good-bye to his home, to enter upon the duties of the i^rtsidency.
</p>
<p>' For more than twenty-five years I have lived among you, and during all that

<p>time I have received nothing l)ut kindness at your hands. Here the most cherished

<p>ties of earth were assumed. Here my children were born, and here one uf ttiem
</p>
<p>lies buried.
</p>
<p>" To you my friends, I owe all that I have all that I am. All the strange
</p>
<p>checkered past seems to crowd now upon mj- mind. To-day I leave yon. I go
</p>
<p>to assume a task more difficult then that whirh devolved upon Gen. Washington.

</p>
<p>araldst scowling enemies with murder and treason in their hearts, Lincoln was

<p>cool and determin -d. He read his inauguml with a voice clear and distinct

<p>enough to ba henrd by twice ten thousand people. When with reverent look he

<p>Mt Countrymek :
</p>
<p>Such is Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Nominee for the Pres-

<p>idency of the nation ; and such the Democratic Douglas affirmed him
</p>
<p>to be when his pale lips were quivering- in death. Yes, when the
</p>
<p>cold^ sweat gathered on the forehead of this loyal Democrat, he said,
</p>
<p>"Were I to live, I would stai.d by Ahruham Lincoln^ and give to him my
</p>
<p>aid in upholding the Constdution, and crushim^ treason and rebellion:'
</p>
<p>but now, could our nation's grief enter the sanctified bosom of that
</p>
<p>ever-loyal man, in his everlasting rest, how must he repudiate the pre-
</p>
<p>varication of the Copperhead sympathizer, and also his equally shuf-

<p>Union Republican cause, cleansed from every particle of alloy. We
</p>
<p>moreover repeat that patriotic truth is powerful in its ever steady
</p>
<p>march m our nation's cause. This has already gone down into the
</p>
<p>dark treasonable hiding-place of the sympathizing forger of party
</p>
<p>poitical lies, and brought him and his nominee for the Presidential
</p>
<p>chair, bound hand and foot, to a tribunal of this American nation from
</p>
<p>which there can be no esca;?''. Thete co-workers with Jeff Davis and
</p>
<p>his master the devil, are tu be pierced right through, with none other
</p>
<p>but truth- Political sympathising, secession. Copperhead disloyalty,
</p>
<p>IS vulnerable, and truth has followed it searching and finding it in all
</p>
<p>Its labyrinths of hellish secrecy. It is now cutting up dis-
</p>
<p>loyalty, root and branch ; so that Jefi" Davis, Buchanan, Val-
</p>
<p>landigham, the notorious Fernando, Horatio, anr1 Georcro B. iicClel-
</p>
<p>lau, have nothing to stand upon. More than this, these'must remain
</p>
<p>forever remain hopeless, defenceless, and sunk, under a scene of their
</p>
<p>owm guilt. My dear, loyal countrymen, listen ye to the majes-
</p>
<p>ty of nothing but patriotic, searching, strong, national truth, because
</p>
<p>this runs upon the judgment seat. Providence is its faithful messen-
</p>
<p>ger, to guide our counsels in the Presidential campaign, in the cab-
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>inet, and also in the battle fiekl. All, all error ! treason, rebellion
</p>
<p>and Copperhead riotous anarchy, Avithout compromise, must fall be-
</p>
<p>neath its power ! Yes, yes, the statesman whose lip is jxilluted by
</p>
<p>treason, and who once denounced the acts of the present incumbent in
</p>
<p>his resort to "military necessity " as unsound, unjust, and treasonable,
</p>
<p>and also, at the same time saying, " remember that a UKjb may pro-
</p>
<p>claim the bloody doctrine of public necessity, as well as a govern-
</p>
<p>ment.'' That man, we say, is now being summoned to a coming- judg-
</p>
<p>ment, by the people at the polls.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, in view of the ultimate triumph of truth in tlie pros-
</p>
<p>pective, that shall guide our countrymen, not as political party men,
</p>
<p>but rather as the nation's loyals, on the 4th of November of this 1864,
</p>
<p>we say, in the language of good, aged Simeon, " Now, Lord, let thy
</p>
<p>servant depart in peace, according to thy word, for mine eyes have
</p>
<p>seen thy salvation." Because one past shall soon run to meet another,
</p>
<p>with tidings to shoAv Jefferson Davis and George B. McClellan that
</p>
<p>the secession army of the one, and the Copperhead army of the other,
</p>
<p>are routed and spoiled. And then, then ! shall tliex'e be great re-
</p>
<p>joicing in heaven, saying Haleluiah 1 for true and righteous are thy
</p>
<p>judgments, Lord God Almighty.
</p>
<p>We submit to the guidance of purifying, searching, irresistable
</p>
<p>truth, and retire, leaning on the top of our staff, uttering and reiterat-
</p>
<p>ing tlie sentiment of a wise King, that '' righteousness exalteth a
</p>
<p>nation,''
