<p>GOVERNMENT OP THE UNITED STATES.
</p>
<p>PREFACE,
</p>
<p>ROFESSOR ROBISON undertook the gigantic
</p>
<p>talk of proving a confpiracy againft all the religions and gov-
</p>
<p>ernments in the world : I am contented with a fmall fedion
</p>
<p>of his fubjeb.
</p>
<p>My aim will be, to place the charge of infidel confpiracy,
</p>
<p>where it ought to rell, in compaffing which I (liall pafs ra-
</p>
<p>pidly, and without much ceremony, through the folemn
</p>
<p>forms ^ in which religion is prefented, in order to arrive at
</p>
<p>the fubftance ; and in examining this (hall occafionally, and
</p>
<p>without much fenfibility, advert to the paffions and arts op-
</p>
<p>pofed to my procefs ; and after fixing the character of
</p>
<p>federal religion, fhall follow it through the political courfe,
</p>
<p>which it has taken from the infancy of our government to
</p>
<p>the day of the date of thefe prefents  fhall with much cool-
</p>
<p>nefs call fome clafles of men hypocrites, who have pafled
</p>
<p>for faints  and fhall fhew that whether republicanifm means
</p>
<p>fomething or nothing ; yet that the allufions and diftant
</p>
<p>hints of republicans about the exiftence of an hypocritical
</p>
<p>northern phalanx meant fomething.  And from premifes
</p>
<p>thus conflruded fhall attempt to prove, that chriftianity and
</p>
<p>the government of the United States have a conftant, pow-
</p>
<p>erful, and efficient enemy in the New-England union of
</p>
<p>Church and State.
</p>
<p>This union forms completely one political party in our
</p>
<p>country, but the real illuminatifts of this order are not con-
</p>
<p>fined exactly to New-England. Every trufly hearts of oak
</p>
<p>man bears the light with him acrofs the Atlantic : It irradi-
</p>
<p>ates the northern parts of the (late of New-York, and guides
</p>
<p>the Miffionaries' path , it twinkles in Jerfey, is a dark Ian-

<p>thorn in Pennfylvania, glimmers like an expiring taper in
</p>
<p>IV
</p>
<p>Delaware, is a fullen light in Maryland, and is extinguifhed
</p>
<p>at the feat of government. Thofe, who have heretofore
</p>
<p>ferved this light have been well paid for their fervice, and
</p>
<p>(ince they hav taken the popular ground of religion to fuf-
</p>
<p>tain themfelvcs and to humble us, we cannot take better
</p>
<p>ground than by charging them with hypocrify and by rely-
</p>
<p>ing for proof on their lives, their public means, and certain
</p>
<p>ends of action.
</p>
<p>We find this ftandard in the gofpel, which they profefs
</p>
<p>to revere, and we offer to refign every thing into their hands,
</p>
<p>whenever their lives fhall confute our pofitions. They can
</p>
<p>overwhelm us with proteftations ; but to the law and the
</p>
<p>teflimonles, if they preach not, and if they praclife not ac-
</p>
<p>cording to th^fe, there is no light in them.
</p>
<p>Living in the midfl of men whom my fubjefl contem-
</p>
<p>plates, it has occurred to me that their fteady habits and
</p>
<p>good profefTions have brought them fuflicient profits^, and
</p>
<p>that our pious anceftors have been bought and fold often
</p>
<p>enough ; therefore that fome man, who has paid his propor-
</p>
<p>tion for thefe habits, fhould take it in charge to put an end
</p>
<p>to the traffic, and to place the dealers in a way of laying in
</p>
<p>a new (lock of their own manufacture.
</p>
<p>This fubjeCt is like a new country : he, who firft enters
</p>
<p>into it mufh encounter fome briers and fome ferpents ; but a
</p>
<p>fucceffion of laborers, working with their axes at the roots,
</p>
<p>will open a way through the wildernefs, and hereafter the
</p>
<p>folitary place will be glad for them, and the defert will re-
</p>
<p>joice.
</p>
<p>Many are for retaining the old order of things, becaufe
</p>
<p>it is a quiet one ; fo are death and the grave ; but are men
</p>
<p>willing to arrive at thcfe, ftript of civil and religious lib-
</p>
<p>erty, merely for the fake of peace .'* But peace can never be
</p>
<p>long preferved, if the public mind is fuffered to lleep. The
</p>
<p>dreadful convulfions in Europe were preceded by ftupors

<p>ERE man to live through feveral centuries, he might

<p>aSbrd to employ one, at leaft, in experiments on theology and
</p>
<p>politics, and enlift all his pafiions in battle royal againfl thofe, who
</p>
<p>would not fubfcribe to his -theories ; but in a fliortlife, having every
</p>
<p>thing to learn, no infallible teacher nor ftandard ; honor, wealth
</p>
<p>and pleafure to gain, and yet to fecure an immortality of happinefs ;
</p>
<p>to keep in favor with the great, and hold friendfliips with elevated
</p>
<p>bafenefs ; yet to m.aintain principles inconflftent with fuch favor
</p>
<p>and friendlhips, is too complicated a taflc : V/hen half-finiflied,

<p>Ta fimplify this complex fituation and to find a fafe courfe for

<p>infinitely deferving an hour's critical attention.

<p>To rear empires in the old world, has been the tailv of conquer-

<p>curious workmen in politics, theology and the arts : all fink and

<p>An infant knows nothing. Arrived at maturity, he buftlcs
</p>
<p>about independence of thought and of fpeaking and writing nat-
</p>
<p>urally, of abflra^t ideas and (irft principles : yet he has learnt aii
</p>
<p>which he knows ; forgetting from whom he iearnt it, he confiders
</p>
<p>it as his own, and through mere defedl of memory, claims the
</p>
<p>credit of originality.  A thoufand men, born in different parts
</p>
<p>of the world, will have pafTed a thoufand modes of being, and
</p>
<p>yet each will avow infallible ideas of religion, government and
</p>
<p>the concerns of life.
</p>
<p>In this advanced flate of the world, human fyftems are fo
</p>
<p>wrought, that it is eafier to adopt them than to invent new ones,
</p>
<p>and if the father worfhipped the apis, or adored the crocodile, or
</p>
<p>bowed at the foot of an emperor's throne, or kifTed the pope's
</p>
<p>flipper, (o mud the fon, and the fon's fon, to the lateft generation ;
</p>
<p>and he, who followeth n&t the eftaolifhed habit, is denounced by
</p>
<p>implicit followers, and the fyflrem-mongers all join to fay, * Let
</p>
<p>* him be accurfed, for he deflroyeth the ancient land-mark, he
</p>
<p>* breaketh up the foundation of many generations'  and their fol-
</p>
<p>lowers are obliged to refpond, * Let him be accurfed'  but a new
</p>
<p>order of things has emboldened many to rifque exorcifms, to look
</p>
<p>into the mylferious antiquities, to rend the unconfecrated veil, to
</p>
<p>fhew the people that the holy of holies is not local, and that the
</p>
<p>day has palled by, when he, who touched the mountain, fhould
</p>
<p>be (loned. Among thefe I have afTumed the taHc of fpeaking to
</p>
<p>you definitely of the union of church and (late in our country.
</p>
<p>For diftindl perceptions of this fubje^t we are much indebted to
</p>
<p>the prudence, candor and franknefs of our opponents. Federal
</p>
<p>riters have been prudent in publifhing the grofTeft falfehoods under
</p>
<p>ctitious names ; for otherwife they would long fince have been
</p>
<p>publicly convidted of their bafenefs, and the caufe which theu at-
</p>
<p>tempted to efpoufe, would have been checked, before 'its demrmi-
</p>
<p>ties were apparent. Federal orators have been candid in expofing
</p>
<p>all the anti-republican tendencies of their party, and in threatening
</p>
<p>what they would do, if they had power. C'srical politicians have
</p>
<p>(hewn a degree of franknefs, (hardly reconcileable with their real

<p>characters, ) in boldly laying the crofs at the feet of Pinckney,
</p>
<p>Hamilton, fedition law and new judiciary. We find no fault that
</p>
<p>our adverfaries have placed their features in a light, where we can
</p>
<p>truly take them.
</p>
<p>The great events of a fev/ pad years have gradually introduced
</p>
<p>the light neccfTary to this portraiture. The pafTions, engendered in
</p>
<p>darknefs, and which feck concealment till they can come for-
</p>
<p>ward with efFeft, have flowly and unfufpe(^lingly met this light, not
</p>
<p>aware that fome were watching the moment, when they could be
</p>
<p>diftindly feen.
</p>
<p>New-England federallfm appeared to be protejianty and to willi
</p>
<p>the downfal of hierarchies, till the church of Rome began to
</p>
<p>tetter : then it began to pray for her re-eftablifhment, ardently as
</p>
<p>faints for rebuilding the walls of Jerufalem. The French, who till
</p>
<p>that time had been our good friends and allies, were called a fet
</p>
<p>oi atheifts and anarchifts. No curfes were too fevere to implore
</p>
<p>on them for abolifliing hierarchies and for fufpending the obfervance
</p>
<p>of that day, which had been before devoted to the diflionor of God,
</p>
<p>and the ruin of man. No pity for opprefTed humanity reihained
</p>
<p>the rage of our church and ftate men. No cries afcended to heav-
</p>
<p>en for relief of freemen. With joy the combined troops of the
</p>
<p>throne and the altar were announced as hurhng their thunders on
</p>
<p>devoted France. The paflions were gradually raifed. The cries
</p>
<p>of infidelity and modern philofophy were founded through the
</p>
<p>country, and the rage of holy church and ftate men was direded
</p>
<p>againrt infidel France. Even the royalift Barruel, a papift, be-
</p>
<p>came a favorite, although at the expence of our proteftant ancef-
</p>
<p>tors, the Albigenfes and Waldenfes, he criminated France. Every
</p>
<p>little fubjed of a political prelate took in charge the caufe of God
</p>
<p>and fettled in his narrow mind a queftion mighty enough for the
</p>
<p>greateft talents of two contending worlds. A little cumberer of
</p>
<p>the ground, a miferable portion of dufi and afhes, to which the
</p>
<p>worms are heirs apparent, decides on the counfels of his Maker, and
</p>
<p>decrees in his behalf that the holy father had been wrongfully dif-
</p>
<p>turbed  that the king of France fhould be reftored  that the thr(jne
</p>
<p>and the altar fliould be more clofely united, and that the old order
</p>
<p>of things fhould be revived. To exprefs thefe mighty decrees a
</p>
<p>new vocabulary is invented to abufe the friends of civil and religious
</p>
<p>liberty, and to compliment the tyrants and murderers of the world.
</p>
<p>'  Was this the fpirit of chriflianity, or of church and flate ?
</p>
<p>New-England federalifm appeared to be ckrijllan, till by irrita-
</p>
<p>tion of the public mind, and falfe alarms, federal power was able to
</p>
<p>raife an army and navy, and to create extenfive eflablirnments of
</p>
<p>wealth and grandeur, perfectly confiflent with church and date

<p>kingdom of a humble Redeemer.
</p>
<p>New-England federalifm appeared to ht federal, till a change of
</p>
<p>adminiftration defiroyed the grand objed of church and flate,
</p>
<p>v/hich always was, pov/er to the leaders, delufion to the followers,
</p>
<p>and ruin to oppofition. Then this federalifm cried out for dif-
</p>
<p>memberment of the (lates- the death of federalifm.
</p>
<p>Hypocrify is not chargeable on our federal leaders in church
</p>
<p>and flate, nor their humble organs, the orators and editors, becaufe
</p>
<p>they have publiflied the fads, on which thefe views are formed.
</p>
<p>Their hypocrify confifls in profefTmg to love liberty, chriftianity
</p>
<p>and federalifm ; yet in the name of thefe, purfuing meafures hoftile
</p>
<p>to them ail, and concealing from the people the fupieme objeft,
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>their own confequence, which can be compafTed only in the def-
</p>
<p>trudion of thefe blcflings : for none of thefe can be cherifhed fin-
</p>
<p>cerely in any heart without facrificing the luft of power, which is
</p>
<p>their main-fpring of a(5lion.
</p>
<p>The infidious arts, by which this procefs has been effefted, fur-
</p>
<p>nifii a fubje<5t too extenfive for ample difcuflion in the propofed
</p>
<p>compafs ; but this will be accepted as my blow at the root of
</p>
<p>church and (late union^
</p>
<p>NO. 11.
</p>
<p>Vitw of the origin cf Church and State Union in New^
</p>
<p>England,
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>AM not about to prefent a new charader of religion
</p>
<p>under the fun ; it is one, which has prevailed in every nation,
</p>
<p>where the throne and the altar have been in alliance, and in every
</p>
<p>heart where this alliance is approved. It is a charader, to which
</p>
<p>every religion has tended with as much certainty as bodies tend to
</p>
<p>the centre. Mankind have been always difpofed to appropriate
</p>
<p>heaven to earthly purpofes.
</p>
<p>The Jews received a perfe<5l law under the theocracy ; but find-
</p>
<p>ing the obfervance of it inconfiftent with their lufts, their clergy
</p>
<p>and council by degrees changed it to a religion well adapted to hu-
</p>
<p>man pride, and built altars to this pride. The humble votaries,
</p>
<p>grateful to their new lawgivers, bent the knee to the builders of the
</p>
<p>altar, and forgot the God of heaven. The pried took his ftand
</p>
<p>within the holy of holies ; the counfellor ftood without to attend
</p>
<p>the incerife of the fat of rams and the oblations of rivers of oil.
</p>
<p>Religion became a profitable, contemptible pageantry, yet it retain-
</p>
<p>ed fo much earthly power that when the fon of David appeared
</p>
<p>andexpofcd this ftate of things, Pilate could not offer to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple a more acceptable fubjevH: of crucifixion.
</p>
<p>To this new religion the proud unioniits of Jewifh church and
</p>
<p>flate did not fubmit. Tiie great, who had formed powerful con-
</p>

<p>feaft was fliared by the obfcure. Many faid. Lord, Lord, but did
</p>
<p>rot what he commanded : many wore fad countenances to be feen
</p>
<p>of men : maAy prefaced their alms by found of trumpet, and chofe
</p>
<p>confpicuous places for their devotions ; yet the humble publican, the
</p>
<p>poor widow, the meek and defpifed, compofed the retinue of the
</p>
<p>Saviour. While buffetings and perfecutions were the lot of chrif-
</p>
<p>tians, the knowing ones avoided profeflion ; but when it was dif-
</p>
<p>covered that this religion could be made an engine of ftate, and that
</p>
<p>civilians and ecclefiaftics could fuftain each other, it became fafli-
</p>
<p>ionable to profefs. The first union of church and state
</p>
<p>IN Christendom was the corner stone on which satan
</p>
<p>WAS tobuilp his fabric of infidelity. High priefts pray-
</p>
<p>ed for kings ; kings furnifhed laws to fupport religion ; the Sav-
</p>
<p>iour's promife to fuflain his church was forgotten, or his power to
</p>
<p>fulfil the promife was doubted. His pi<aure decorated the walls
</p>
<p>of churches ; but the knee was bent and the eye lifted to his ho-
</p>
<p>linefs, the fountain of all fpiritual power, and to his majefty, who
</p>
<p>kept that fountain overflowing with the wealth of a fubjugated
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>This magnificent union having for centuries overfpread Chrif-
</p>
<p>tendom, and having humbled by perfecutions and cruelties every
</p>
<p>fucceeding clafs of real chriftians, was at length abridged by the
</p>
<p>reformation. In the courfe of a (ingle century, among the churches,
</p>
<p>called reformed, that of England became moft confpicuous for the
</p>
<p>fame union, which in its turn was abridged by the puritans, who
</p>
<p>firfl: fettled this country, and New-England can claim the uninter-
</p>
<p>rupted fucceflion of this church and flate power.
</p>
<p>The exiftence and deteftable charader of three of thefe unions will
</p>
<p>never be doubted. It is my province to confider the fourth, and as the
</p>
<p>piety of our anceftors has formed the bafis of our church and flate
</p>
<p>union, and fmce much of paflion, falfehood and fuperftition have
</p>
<p>been improved in the hiftory and application of this piety, I fhall
</p>
<p>proceed in the next number to fpeak of our anceftors in fach terms
</p>
<p>as my fubjed requires, and with the exprefs intent of Ihewing that
</p>
<p>our church and ftate unionifts, who claim to be heirs of the b'efiing,
</p>
<p>have a<flually inherited fome conftituent parts of their religlonj an4
</p>
<p>that this religion is not chriftianity.

<p>EN have been taught to look into antiquity with as
</p>
<p>much dread as children into a haunted room, and this fubjedt has
</p>
<p>been fo artfully obfcured that the elucidation of it requires a per-
</p>
<p>fectly new procefs.
</p>
<p>I vyould bow with all reverence before the generation which
</p>
<p>firft died in this country, with lefs to the next, and would diminifh
</p>
<p>B
</p>
<p>lO
</p>
<p>in refpedl till I came to the prefent, and would then hold all my co-
</p>
<p>temporaries in total contempt ; would kneel before illuftrious
</p>
<p>fhades and defpife living men, could I find any juft authority for it :
</p>
<p>but who will give me furety that in confideration of this homage
</p>
<p>the people of the next century will as thoroughly venerate the prefent
</p>
<p>generation ? Did our anceftors wifh that we fhould ufe their, char-
</p>
<p>afters as engines of torture for our neighbours ? and were they defi-
</p>
<p>rous that one half of their defcendants fhould in their names abufe
</p>
<p>the other half? If fo, they merit no reverence for fuch difpofitions.
</p>
<p>If the charafter of the prefent generation mufl: be facrificcd, let
</p>
<p>it rather be done to the fmiling infants and rifing hopes of future
</p>
<p>generations, than to the infenfible duft and afhes of the paft. If
</p>
<p>any benefit is gained by faying that every generation grows worfe,
</p>
<p>that experience and example have tended to debafe human nature,
</p>
<p>and that thefe are peculiarly evil times, let this benefit defcend to
</p>
<p>our children, whofe chance of rifing, after defcending from fuch
</p>
<p>parents, mufl be wretched indeed.
</p>
<p>Thofe preachers and moraiifls, who rife on the ruins of human
</p>
<p>nature, and thrive on the growth of depravity may, if they under-
</p>
<p>ilandthe human heart, look into their own and find that the m&ik
</p>
<p>felfifh paiTions impel them to their work. He, who is conflantly
</p>
<p>convincing me of my fins, of his own righteoufnefs, and of that
</p>
<p>judgment, which is to give him an everlafling afcendency over me,
</p>
<p>is employed in a very proud calling. He, who talks about ancef-
</p>
<p>tors, is fuppofed to be very knowing about antiquity, and it is much
</p>
<p>more glorious to be fcientific about things of no confequence, the
</p>
<p>proof of which is obfcure, than to know thofe important things,
</p>
<p>which are d^ily pafiing before us.  He, who is fevere on the
</p>
<p>paganifm and immorality of remote antiquity, fhews his abhorrence
</p>
<p>of evil, and hurts the feelings of no man, becaufe none can trace his
</p>
<p>kjndred fo far back. He, who praifes and compliments my ancef-
</p>
<p>tors, touches fome fine fibres of a felfifh heart, and prepares me to
</p>
<p>believe that the befl of principles and motives mufi influence one,
</p>
<p>" who charms fo wifely." He, who caufes the thunders of heav-

</p>
<p>ferenity ; but he awakens every fcnfe of joy, when he direfts the
</p>
<p>bolts upon my political adverfaries. He, who ncgleds his mafter's
</p>
<p>work to attend to mine, fecures my zeal to fcreen him from merit-
</p>
<p>ed reproach and punifhment.
</p>
<p>If diflTerent beings had been employed in making man, they
</p>
<p>would doubtlefs have differed extremely in their workmanfhip, and
</p>
<p>ingenuity might have been employed in tracing the relative capacity
</p>
<p>of the artlfls : but as one infinite Creator has made all men, it is
</p>
<p>probable that there are no differences of charafter between thofe
</p>
<p>of one and another century, except what have been produced by
</p>
<p>the different degrees of light, which he has been pleafed to reveal
</p>
<p>to them. The increafe of moral knowledge hr^^ increjfe^^ men's per-

</p>
<p>ceptlons of moral light. Civilization has brought in its train vir-
</p>
<p>tues axid vices : Seafons of danger have exhibited courage  feafons
</p>
<p>of want, temperance  and feafons of luxury have given ccafional
</p>
<p>checks to moral practice. The depravity of man has difcovered
</p>
<p>itfelf in different forms : Superftition marks one century, hypocrify
</p>
<p>the next : Parfimony charaderizes the father, profufion thefon. 
</p>
<p>The occupants of each century have generally taken good care to
</p>
<p>call themfelves worfe than thole before them, andthofe of the next
</p>
<p>have been obliged to exalt the virtues of their anceftors, and to
</p>
<p>humble themfelves under a fenfe of their inferiority, and this (late
</p>
<p>of things will probably laft, till fome curious operator (hall find a
</p>
<p>mode to extrad felfilhnefs from the human heart, or till the arts of
</p>
<p>trafHcking with our pious anceftors fhall ceafe to be fuccefsful.
</p>
<p>Having glanced at the motives of our church and ftate men, I
</p>
<p>proceed to remark that their firft advance towards taking pofleffion
</p>
<p>of the piety of our anceftors, is by exciting a great portion of fenfi-
</p>
<p>bility in their favor. Indeed their leaving their native country to
</p>
<p>fettle in this wildernefs, and eftablifhlng themfelves in the m.idft of
</p>
<p>want and hardfiilps againft favage tribes, is well calculated for the
</p>
<p>opening of fuch a work : but will you compare all this v/lth the
</p>
<p>fuffcrings of the natives, flying in every direftion, or by whole vil-
</p>
<p>lages buried under the burning ruins of their once peaceful dv/ell-
</p>
<p>ings ? Here gratitude is artfully called up to balance the account
</p>
<p>in favor of our anceftors, and the luxuriance of our fields is fum-
</p>
<p>moned to witnefs their claim to all our homage. The tawny' war-
</p>
<p>rior has left no hlftorian to record his virtues, no rich defcendants
</p>
<p>to emblazon his name, no ftone to record the place from which he
</p>
<p>and his wife and children too fuddenly ftarted for eternity !
</p>
<p>It is extremely popular to excite fenfibility and to exprefs grati-
</p>
<p>tude, efpecially when the exercife of them cofts nothing. Had
</p>
<p>not our anceftors come here, we might have been born in England,
</p>
<p>and been fubje<5t to funding fyftems, ftamp acts, fedition laws  to
</p>
<p>the enormous indebtednefs and dlftrefiSng policy of that nation : or
</p>
<p>we might have been born in Scotland, and under an infamous alien

<p>adl, been tranfported to Botany Bay with Muir, Skirviag, Mar-
</p>
<p>garet, and fuch reftlefs fpirits : or we might have been born in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, and been implicated in all its treafons and rebellions againft a
</p>
<p>moft gracious fovereign, who in the fupremacy of his condefcen-
</p>
<p>fion, would have fent over powerful armxies to form an inland nav-
</p>
<p>igation, to be fupplied by ftreams from our veins. In what wild,
</p>
<p>barbarous regions of frozen Finland, or defpotic Ruliia, might not
</p>
<p>our anceftors have placed us ?
</p>
<p>Are we then to blefs anceftors for placing us in an eligible coun-
</p>
<p>try or to curfe them for placing us in a wretched country ? The
</p>
<p>conception is abfurd : merit is always connected with motives, and
</p>
<p>our anceftors came herewith motives, perfedlly their own. It is
</p>
<p>a relief to men, while in ardent purfuit of wealth, enduring cold>
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>hunger and ha.rdlliips, to fay, * All this is for pofterity,' The
</p>
<p>niifer has not always the fortitude to fay, * I love gold fo well that
</p>
<p>rather than part with it, I will fee all my neighborhood wretched ;'
</p>
<p>no, he fays, * I mufl lay up fomething for my children.' The
</p>
<p>man, who does cruel things in the courfe of bufinefs, will never
</p>
<p>own the hardnefs of his heart and the indomitable power of gold ;
</p>
<p>no, he fays, * Juftice to myfelf and family requires me to do fo.*
</p>
<p>We mufl indulge thefe weak natures in fome occafional evafions ;
</p>
<p>but vjhzn fyjiems of evaiion are adopted, we muft combat them.
</p>
<p>A general regard to the interefts of pofterity is confident with
</p>
<p>the beftinterefts of the prefentday. It extends the views, and en-
</p>
<p>ables a man to think that he fees what he does not fee, and that he
</p>
<p>fetls, what he never felt ; but the man, who prates much about
</p>
<p>pofterity and anceftry, generally does it to conceal what he is. 
</p>
<p>Our anceftors never conceived of us : had they lived to the prefent
</p>
<p>moment, we fhould have been too diftant from them in kindred to
</p>
<p>hiave engaged their cares or affeftions, and we fliould have cared
</p>
<p>as little for them. Curiofity might have drawn us to fee the man,
</p>
<p>who firft fet foot on American ground, who fiiot the firfi: native,
</p>
<p>who fet fire to the firft village, or who diftinguiflicd himfelf in the
</p>
<p>early ads of taking poftefTion of this country ; but there would have
</p>
<p>been an end of the bufinefs.
</p>
<p>Let me nov/ call you to look at our anceftors juft as you would
</p>
<p>at a clafs of men, coming here at this time and condudling as they
</p>
<p>did. Did they fly from perfecution, becaufe they hated it in prin-
</p>
<p>ciple, or was it becaufe it was dire6led againft them ? At their firft
</p>
<p>eftablifhment here, they perfecuted with more violence than they
</p>
<p>had fuffered. Did they leave their homes to find a little retired
</p>
<p>fpot in the wildernefs, where they might enjoy the little, which
</p>
<p>man wants here below, and from which might afcend daily, and un-
</p>
<p>interrupted afpirations to heaven ' Their firft obje^Sl was extent of
</p>
<p>territory, and they combated for it with a zeal and perfeverance
</p>
<p>worthy of a better caufe. Did they love humanity and peace ?
</p>
<p>But they were in conftant wars with their tawny brethren^ children

<p>of the fame univerfal Father. Did they love toleration ? But they
</p>
<p>denied it to Quakers and Adamites, v/ho like them had fled to the
</p>
<p>fame country. If they loved civil and religious liberty, why was
</p>
<p>every exertion made to deftroy them ? Exprefsly becaufe they
</p>
<p>were fubject to paflions, like to thofe men, whom they had left.
</p>
<p>They fought, quarrelled, finned and puniflied, as often in proportion
</p>
<p>to their numbers as their pofterity,* except that the vices, which
</p>
<p>arife from luxury, could not attach to them.
</p>
<p>* Sec the bhie laws and Trumbull's hiftory for fa<5^sto futlaln this num-
</p>
<p>ber , a recital of the cruelty of their wars, the bittcrncfs of their difputeis,
</p>
<p>the multitude and fcverity of their punifliments, thcdcfedtion of their zealots,
</p>
<p>&c. would be tedious. It is natural, in turning thofe pages, leaf by leaf, t
</p>
<p>obfcrvs how rapidly the paflions gained againft the religion of tha^ age, and
</p>
<p>^ ^3
</p>
<p>I do not fpeak of Lord Say and Seal, and Sir Edmond An-
</p>
<p>drus, and other barons and knights, who came here. Such men
</p>
<p>are ahke throughout the world ; the odium of their memories
</p>
<p>ought not to defcend to any : but ourj{>/<?.v.r anceftors were the very
</p>
<p>men who exhibited the chara(5ter which I have defcribed, and
</p>
<p>they fucceeded in laying the foundation of a church and date
</p>
<p>union.
</p>
<p>The policy and earthly advantages of this union were perfe(5tly
</p>
<p>underftood in the country of their birth. A very little imagina-
</p>
<p>tion could form a ftriking allegory between the children of Ifrael
</p>
<p>and our anceftors. Egypt and Britain  the Red Sea and the ocean
</p>
<p> the ancient and modern wildernefs  the Amorites and the
</p>
<p>Indian tribes.  What more fultable, after fuch apt copulatives, than
</p>
<p>the jundion of Mofes and Aaron ? A few things were wanting
</p>
<p>to complete the refemblance, fuch as the pillar of a cloud and the
</p>
<p>pillar of fire, and a divine command to drive out the heathen :
</p>
<p>but the pallions of man will eafily accomplifli what his imagination
</p>
<p>cannot, and hence we find that while one clafs of our anceftors
</p>
<p>were engaged in war,, the others were bufy in forming civil
</p>
<p>government (as they termed it according to the mind and will of
</p>
<p>God.)
</p>
<p>This was the fitteft feafon on earth to have feparated church
</p>
<p>and ftate, whofe union had fo long been difgraceful. Now was the
</p>
<p>time to have laid folid foundations of humanity, toleration, vita!
</p>
<p>religion, and rational government ; but the luxuries of Egypt had
</p>
<p>more temptations than the manna of the wildernefs, the old path
</p>
<p>was beaten, the profits of the old order of things were too tempt-
</p>
<p>ing  our fathers yielded to it. In gathering churches, any num-
</p>
<p>ber of perfons, declaring themfelves faints, were to be deemed
</p>
<p>fuch ; thefe formed a church, with a right to admit to communion
</p>
<p>fuch as (liould thereafter profefs, fo as to perfuade l/jem that they
</p>
<p>were fincere. Thefe faints afllimed all earthly dominion, excluded
</p>
<p>from their order as they pleafed, held from office all but them-
</p>
<p>felves, denied baptifm to all but the children of communicants,

<p>excommunicated Quakers and Antinomians  decided on creeds and
</p>
<p>herefies, and chole preachers for themfelves and the finners.
</p>
<p>Thus an immenfe power was lodged in thefe people, and an im-
</p>
<p>menfe patronage conneded with it ; and all this having no other
</p>
<p>foundation than their own declarations. All power, inftead of
</p>
<p>being derived from the people, was derived from the clergy.
</p>
<p>Every thing was made to bend to holy church. Spiritual tyranny
</p>
<p>was eftablifhed, and the rights of man were, in terms and in fadt,
</p>
<p>treated with total contempt. Religion was fald to be the whole
</p>
<p>how thefe paflions burfl forth with an impetuofity, proportioned to the
</p>
<p>reflraint. Thofe, who wifh to eilablifti the fuperior piety of our ancef-
</p>
<p>tors, muft guard all accefs to their hiftory effc dually, as Eden was guarded,
</p>
<p>*fter the expullbn of Adam.
</p>
<p>bufinefs of man, and the main bufinefs of religion was civil gov-
</p>
<p>ernment.
</p>
<p>This ftate of intolerance and ufurpatlon lafted till (as the
</p>
<p>adulators of our anceftors fay) a generation rofe up, who had not
</p>
<p>the fpirit of their fathers ; but in fa6t, a generation rofe up, who
</p>
<p>were refolved that religion and liberty fhould not deftroy each
</p>
<p>other. They faw in the whole of this fyftem, the paffions of man
</p>
<p>operating, as they always had done, and that in a change of coun-
</p>
<p>tries they had only changed madevs. This produced difputes
</p>
<p>about qualifications of admiilion to the ordinances and a great va
</p>
<p>riety of dodrinal points, which were fometimes agitated before
</p>
<p>councils of clergy, and fometimes before legiflatures. The mind
</p>
<p>and will of God was made to depend on the occafional majorities of
</p>
<p>popular affemblies, and to crown the farce, his majefly fent over a
</p>
<p>decree, enjoining that the churches fliould renounce their rigid and
</p>
<p>intolerant habits : Which decree, we are told, was confidered as
</p>
<p>an infringement of the rights of confcience. I have the fame ref-
</p>
<p>ped for this kind of confcience, which the Qu^akers and Adamites
</p>
<p>muft have had, who were banifhed for exercife of it, or as the
</p>
<p>Anabaptifts and Antinomians had, when they felt the force of pun-
</p>
<p>ifhment for claiming their rights.
</p>
<p>It is not my province to confider how much of piety was in all
</p>
<p>this bufinefs ; it is enough that there was much of paflion, pride, and
</p>
<p>zeal for earthly dominion, and little of that humble ardent devotion
</p>
<p>which characterizes the pure in fpirit. The really pious men of the
</p>
<p>world feldom find a place in hiftory ; the noifelefs tenor of their
</p>
<p>way offers no lure to the fycophant of a fucceeding age. High
</p>
<p>crimes, pov/erful artifices, daring achievements fwell thehidorian's
</p>
<p>page, and higheft in the favor and applaufes of our church and ftate
</p>
<p>men are the chara(5lers of thofe, who have confpicuoufly aided the
</p>
<p>fyftem of governing earth in the name of heaven.
</p>
<p>If our anceftors really pOifefTed in this country the good principles,
</p>
<p>which they profefied in their owe, if they pra6tifed faithfully on
</p>
<p>thofe principles,if they rejeded the temptations of wealth andpov/er,

</p>
<p>neither praifes nor cenfures can affed them. It is enough for me
</p>
<p>to have prefented thofe leading traits in their characters, which ftiew
</p>
<p>their refemblance to other men when full of power. The firft
</p>
<p>chriftians were virtuous ; bat when the chriftian name became pow-

<p>erful the character was loft. Our anceftors fet out from England
</p>
<p>with virtuous profefiions : but when they found the pov/er in them-
</p>
<p>felves, they became lordly and intolerant. This is the courfe of
</p>
<p>nature : when the firft ardors even of virtuous imprellions are ex-
</p>
<p>pended, the glory of the day is gone. This tru;h opens the ruin
</p>
<p>of all human greatnefs : providence has provided that it (hall ruin

</p>
<p>is_^

<p>anceftors, contained in itfelf the feeds of its now approaching diffo-
</p>
<p>lution. The appearance of extreme piety was necefTary at firft.

<p>This abated by degrees, and at length the unionifts have difpenfed

<p>Ours deal in anceftors, rare legends, profefiions, and' whatever may

</p>

</p>
<p>eftate. They next claim and really own a great part of the
</p>
<p>v/ealth of the country. They claim the houfes of worfliip, and their
</p>
<p>priefts minifter at the altar. They next claim the ordinances and the
</p>
<p>feats of juftice, and the right of making laws, and the fources of
</p>
<p>public information and the feminaries of fcience : infa(5t, as right heirs
</p>
<p>at law, they claim and hold nearly every thing, and withal, the right
</p>
<p>of denouncing thofe who will not acknowledge them to be in right-
</p>
<p>ful poffeffion. They have a fortrefs on every high hill, troops well
</p>
<p>difciplined, wealth and honors enough to difpenfe, and in this proud
</p>
<p>attitude bid defiance'to the fcattered, untrained men, who are oppo-
</p>
<p>fed to them. They have well ferved parks of artillery, and on the
</p>
<p>lead irritation difcharge powerfully from their colleges, pulpits and
</p>
<p>prefTes. All this ferves thefe unionifts as an immenfe eftate. All
</p>
<p>are admitted to participate, who will own their power : no pradice

<p>to his party and be cannonized alive for his fan<5tity. A pra<5lical
</p>
<p>infidel can take high rank among them, and the cry of religion is in
</p>
<p>danger is the war-whoop of the party.
</p>
<p>Church and ftate courts earthly greatnefs, thrives in the midft of
</p>
<p>wealth and honors, delights in war, and purfues with zeal whatever
</p>
<p>vhriftianity forbid?. lo the midft of eternal flu(5tuation3 of conduct,
</p>
<p>i6
</p>
<p>the zeal of church and ftate for earthly power and dominion is in-
</p>
<p>variable. We fled from the perlecution, oppreflion and tyranny
</p>
<p>of a hierarchy abroad, and inftantly eftablifhed one here. We
</p>
<p>crouched humbly and meanly to Britain till we gained ftrength ; then
</p>
<p>the civilian, who found our offices filled with foreign court favorites,
</p>
<p>and fome of our clergy, who faw the weight of government in the
</p>
<p>fcale againft them, profeffed to be whigs, declared for the rights of
</p>
<p>man, and planned a revolution, which real whigs achieved. What
</p>
<p>was our late Prefident in 1774 ? ^" ^^^ view of our enemies deferving
</p>
<p>an halter. What in i8oc? In the fame view, meriting a crown.
</p>
<p>What were our clergy, when praying againft Britifh fleets and armies ^
</p>
<p>Rebels. What were thofe of them, who in 1800 advocated what
</p>
<p>they had prayed againft? Saints. In 1630 our anceftors detefted
</p>
<p>Britain  in 1670 co-operated with, and loved them  in 1776 we
</p>
<p>warred againft them and cheriflied France  in 1796 loved Britain
</p>
<p>again and hated France, but were truly federal ; and in 1 8ci, cried
</p>
<p>loudly to difiblve the union. Thefe are the fteady habits of church
</p>
<p>and ftate.
</p>
<p>The leaders, true as weathercock to the wind, have been the firft
</p>
<p>to announce and the earlieft to availthemfelvesof any change of weath-
</p>
<p>er ; hence they have been in power, though they have changed prin-
</p>
<p>ciples often as exprefles change poft-horfes : yet, as an exprefc,
</p>
<p>though changing, keeps in view the place from which he came, and
</p>
<p>that to which he is going ; fo they remember that church and ftate
</p>
<p>was their ftarting ground, and human glory the end of their career. 
</p>
<p>But in the midft of all fluftuations, they are true as needle to the
</p>
<p>pole in animofity againft their opponents, and fidelity to their adhe-
</p>
<p>rents ; fo that if one leaves them through difguft, no vengeance is con-
</p>
<p>fidered too exemplary to deter others from defertion : but he who
</p>
<p>is faithful may draw pay to the day of his death. If he falls, they
</p>
<p>will furely raife him, and from this policy they keep many attached
</p>
<p>to them, juft as Britain, though infinitely bankrupt in that which is
</p>
<p>the true bafis of credit, retains the confidence of creditors by a con-
</p>
<p>ftant pun(5tuaiity fultained by new loans.

<p>Thefe are real illuminatifts. They have their illuminatlfm from
</p>
<p>the Jews, the Catholics, the Britons, and their own anceftors ; they
</p>
<p>inherit and pra^ife all the artifice and intrigue of their predeceffors.,
</p>
<p>and purfue precifely the fame objed. Here are no Rcbifon and
</p>
<p>Barruel fi<5tions, no heavy Gertnan quotations, no long lifts of men,
</p>
<p><who were never horriy no forty-five degrees of mafonry : but folid
</p>
<p>modern philofophifm pra^^lfed by men, who are daily to be feen,
</p>
<p>and who may be known by the following figns : The clergy of this
</p>
<p>order pray and preach politics, and profefs their right fo to do.
</p>
<p>They teach a religion extremely like that of the Jews, confifting of
</p>
<p>an o{>tentatious difplay of tenets. They perfecute, and blefs not.
</p>
<p>They pray for the downfal of their enemies, and affume the reverfe
</p>
<p>of what the Saviour recommended on the mount. They admit
</p>
<p>honorary members Into the church : man pofleflfed of church and
</p>
<p>fiate religion, but who have no prctenfions to the grace of the gof-
</p>
<p>pel. Their chofen companions and affociates are the mighty of the
</p>
<p>earth, and they vote pubHcly and in prefence of all the people/c/r
</p>
<p>fome meUi who are reputed and knoiun 'infidels. Though the found of
</p>
<p>the rights of man brought them to their proud fituation, yet that
</p>
<p>found is now grating to their ears. Unconfcious of that patience,
</p>
<p>which endures their outrages againft their profeffions, they can-
</p>
<p>not bear to hear the humble cry of toleration from thofe out of
</p>
<p>power. So far from preaching and pradifmg chrifHanity, they
</p>
<p>preach a religion of this world, pradlife a life of pride, and equip
</p>
<p>their followers in the armour of earth to combat againft the caufe of
</p>
<p>heaven.
</p>
<p>A preacher of this order calculates on profelytes in theology,
</p>
<p>as he does on profelytes in pohtics. He compliments highly thofe
</p>
<p>of his own party, claims for them all the miracles, prophecies, gifts
</p>
<p>and promlfes ; drefTes them in white robes, affigns to them the puri-
</p>
<p>ty of the holy patriarchs, prophets and apoftles, and initates them in
</p>
<p>all the rents and profits of anceftral piety  then he abufes all unbe-
</p>
<p>lievers, mifquotes their writings, mifreprefents their arguments and
</p>
<p>lives, loads on each the lins of all others, colledls all conceivable
</p>
<p>depravity and charges it on them, and then triumphantly afl his
</p>
<p>hearers which fide they will join ? The firft is v/ell underftood to be
</p>
<p>the federal fide, the lad the republican. His hearers conclude
</p>
<p>with great fignificance to prefer the fide of federal chrifiianlty to re-
</p>
<p>publican infidelity. 
</p>
<p>Is all this fair dealing ? Has God fent fuch men to preach his
</p>
<p>gofpei ? If it be true that all holy and heavenly beings are in favor
</p>
<p>of a federal adminiftration, and oppofed to republicanifm ; if
</p>
<p>the election of grace has any connedion with ele6tions to office ;
</p>
<p>if celeftial glory and earthly honors have any affinity, thefe are
</p>
<p>very faithful preachers ; otherwlfe, they are impoftors.  Let me
</p>
<p>ailc, has any clafs of men avowed their preference for immorality
</p>
<p>and anarchy ? Has any clafs aiTumed upon themfelves, and faith-
</p>
<p>fully promifed to maintain, and circulate, the dreams of Condorcet,

<p>or the abfurditles of Godwin i* If fo, let evidence of the fadt be
</p>
<p>produced.  Has any clafs of men appointed thefe preachers to
</p>
<p>abufe them ? or is the love of God fo abundantly Ihed abroad in
</p>
<p>the hearts of thefe political levites, that they are conftrained by it
</p>
<p>to vilify and criminate three fourths of his creation ? Alas ! all
</p>
<p>fuch preachers are not only pra6llcal infidels, but the propagators
</p>
<p>of all the theoretic infidelity which they denounce. Hume,
</p>
<p>Voltaire and Bolingbroke would never have been deifts, if chrif-
</p>
<p>tianity had (hewn itfelf uniformly in the lives of its moft confpic-
</p>
<p>uous profefiors. Thomas Payne probably learnt his infidelity
</p>
<p>from church and ftate union. He had lived in the midft of men,
</p>
<p>who profefied much religion, but who converted the whole to their
</p>
<p>own benefit. C
</p>
<p>i8
</p>
<p>Are fuch clergy as I,have defcribed fit paftors of a holy flock ?
</p>
<p>Are they teaching the humble dodrines of the gofpel ? Is the
</p>
<p>heavenly world to be crouded by men, boafting that they fwayed
</p>
<p>fceptres, and exhaufted the wealth of mlUlons, or that they com-
</p>
<p>manded navies and armies, and guided the llorm in the day of
</p>
<p>{laughter, or that they cheated a nation of its rights ; and will the
</p>
<p>background be Hlled with their humble fycophants, recounting the
</p>
<p>deeds which they, in connection with kings, dukes, generals,
</p>
<p>and courtiers performed ? Think you that the (treets of the New-
</p>
<p>Jerufalem will be graced by a proccffion of popes, cardinals,
</p>
<p>prelates, and our northern political clergy, glorying in the addrefs,
</p>
<p>with which they managed earth in the name of heaven ?
</p>
<p>The gofpel prefents you another heaven, fardiftant, far different
</p>
<p>from this, where the meek, humble expe(5lants of mercy will arrive,
</p>
<p>not in purple robes, nor in the fplendid attire of courtiers ; but na-
</p>
<p>ked and ready to be clothed with the robes of faints ; not vaunt-
</p>
<p>ing, but humbly confelTmg their unworthinefs ; not glorying in
</p>
<p>the impoftures which they pradifed on man in this world, but
</p>
<p>deeply lamenting that they were ever left even to fmaller adls of
</p>
<p>diffimulation. And if that book informs us that fuch will be the
</p>
<p>other world, why are preachers fulTered by their hearers to do,
</p>
<p>in the certain prefence of their Maker here, thofe things, which
</p>
<p>repeated or even known hereafter, will unk them to (hame and
</p>
<p>everlafting contempt ?
</p>
<p>It has always been heretical to fpcak thus of the dignified clergy ;
</p>
<p>but unfortunately for them, it has always been fpoken with truth.
</p>
<p>As the particular exhibition of the hypocrify of thefe men will be
</p>
<p>referved to a future number, I pafs to the figns by which you may
</p>
<p>know the civilians of church and ilate.
</p>
<p>As federalifm here has refolved itfclf wholly into church and
</p>
<p>fliite union, in order to make this its lad defperate fland, I might
</p>
<p>point you diredly to our men in place, to thofe in nomination for

<p>is invited to traits of character. The leading of thefe is inherited
</p>
<p>from pious anceftors, viz. a total averfion to the principles, power
</p>
<p>and practices of Britain, and thereafter a burning zeal for the fame
</p>
<p>national charafler ; at firfl friends to toleration, and equal rights,
</p>
<p>then bitter enemies of both ; adoring the will of the majority, while
</p>
<p>it kept them in place, then contemning that will, when it oppofed
</p>
<p>their ambition. Selfjihnefs would burft througli v/alls of l3rafs,
</p>
<p>could it find no other opening for aiSlion, What can a man do,
</p>
<p>who finds in himfelf inordinate ambition, and invincible zeal to
</p>
<p>govern mankind ? Shall he grovel among the vulgar herd, have
</p>
<p>but 2iftngle fhare in a divifion of rights, take his place in the ranks,
</p>
<p>plough for his bread, and walle his life in obfcurity ? Ordinary
</p>
<p>means v/ill not raifc him rapidly enough  the perception of our
</p>
<p>'9
</p>
<p>great world is too flow for his pride. He fees the multitude
</p>
<p>crouding to the Tanduary.  He knows that in every country reli-
</p>
<p>gion has fleered the muhitude regularly, " as rudder docs the
</p>
<p>** fhip, and that prieft like helmfman holds them at his mercy ;"
</p>
<p>he approaches the altar, embraces the miniflering fervant, and awes
</p>
<p>the multitude to reverence. He becomes fcientific ia the exteriors
</p>
<p>of religion, and takes the high road to promotion.
</p>
<p>If you can find one ambitious ftatefman, deaUngthus in religion,
</p>
<p>and you really believe him fmcere, give to the public his name, let
</p>
<p>the world fee him. Does he love the Saviour better than houfes and
</p>
<p>lands, better than riches and honors ? Stop the coftly colledions
</p>
<p>of mufeums.  Tiiis is a curiofity worth them all !  Alas ! on
</p>
<p>ciofe examination you lind him an habitual religionift, entrenched
</p>
<p>in forms and votes, believed in by men, who hope to follow him in
</p>
<p>all things, wherein he has followed his worldly intereft.  Away
</p>
<p>with fuch curiofities, oar country is full of them. The clergy and
</p>
<p>civilians, whom I have defcribed as of this union, are precifely
</p>
<p>known to their followers as hypocrites ; yet they contrive to keep
</p>
<p>up the ranks of their leaders and followers by arts, the develope-

<p>Every country is divided into two clafles of men  one which
</p>
<p>lives by the labor of the head, and the other by the labor of the
</p>
<p>hands : each claims, that its fervices are the hardeft and moft im-
</p>
<p>portant ; the firft profeffes great zeal for public good, and means
</p>
<p>nothing by it ; the laft does his days work, makes no profeffions,
</p>
<p>but brings his produce to the bctl market. The firll: always gov-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>cms the lad either by deceit or force. Deceit Is the milded way,
</p>
<p>but it requires great labor and management ; force is the fureft.
</p>
<p>The tranfition from deceit to force has been made in all former
</p>
<p>nations, and at the commencement of the pafl: year, we were juft
</p>
<p>croffing the line. The Arabian tales, which had been pra6tifed
</p>
<p>for years, had begun to lofe their effe<St  tub plots and ocean maf-
</p>
<p>facres had ceafed to be articles of faith, and there were ftrong fa^-
</p>
<p>picions that holy church was playing a very worldly game. Church
</p>
<p>and ftate for once lift up its voice without effect. A fyftem of
</p>
<p>deceit is f deteftable, that its agents manage it with great fecrecy
</p>
<p> when detected, there is no refuge from infamy, but in a fyftem
</p>
<p>of force : when that fails, refort is had openly to church and ftate,
</p>
<p>and when that proves infuiticient, when the right owners of na-
</p>
<p>tional property take poiTelTion, thofe who have tried all thefe vaia
</p>
<p>experiments, muft expe(ft to have their conduj^: explored with a
</p>
<p>freedom, which a reign of terror would not admit.
</p>
<p>To gain the fide of thofe men, who do not fight, but who plan
</p>
<p>engagements  ^"of thofe who do not labor, but who enjoy in luxury,
</p>
<p>the fruits of labor, is confidered here a great point gained. Parents
</p>
<p>are ambitious to place their fons in the way to attain this. Col-
</p>
<p>Jeges are the fortrelTes, which command the entrance into this land
</p>
<p>of promife, and thefe have been mofliy officered by church and
</p>
<p>ftate men from their inftitution. Perhaps in other fituations, as
</p>
<p>much might be learnt ; but there is the fame difference in chance
</p>
<p>for promotion between a youth privately, and one publicly educat-
</p>
<p>ed, as there is between officers of a militia, and thofe of a (landing
</p>
<p>army : the laft are well known to be in the line. It is a fact that
</p>
<p>the youth are fent there in order to prepare for fuccefs in this world,
</p>
<p>and even ^iffwj- parents confider an education given to a fon, equal
</p>
<p>to a farm, or a trade, given to his brethren, and really, if the edu-
</p>
<p>cated fon fucceeds, he will enter into the public field, which is in
</p>
<p>better cultivation, than the fields of his brethren. It will not be
</p>
<p>denied, that thefe colleges are now totally oppofed to the general
</p>
<p>government, and that thence have ifTued the mofl virulent attacks

</p>
<p>and officers of the flate, are afTociated at the head of them, and
</p>
<p>that thefe have been careful to fupport in(lru6tors, hoftile to our
</p>
<p>prefent government. Under fuch aufpices, a young man, without
</p>
<p>any appeal to his palfions, is very likely to follow the track of his
</p>
<p>iuperiors. To him they appear to be men of the firft magnitude,
</p>
<p>becaufe in the narrow compafs of his vifion, none are greater.

<p>This fires his ambition. He fees thefe men connected with other
</p>
<p>great men in church and flatc  and that all the promotions, and
</p>
<p>honors of life are in their gift.
</p>
<p>While his inilruaor is teaching him the abflra<St nonfenfe, that
</p>
<p>there is no heat in fire, and no cold in ice, and that our fenfes are

</p>
<p>great obje<5ts of purfult. The profeffion of medicine is not in the

<p>All the machinery of a felfifh heart is put in rapid motion. He

<p>every thing about him  tends to infufe into his mind rays of that
</p>
<p>illurainatifm, which is to guide him through life. Does any friend
</p>
<p>feize this wavering moment to point him to the decay of real reli-
</p>
<p>gion, and to the importance of devoting his talents to drive away
</p>
<p>that ftate religion, which pafTes for chriftianity ? Does any one in-
</p>
<p>ftrud him in the principles of our revolution and in the total perver-
</p>
<p>fion of thofe principles, and does he fee that the powers of the ftate
</p>
<p>are as fully in the hands of the enemies of civil liberty, as thofe of
</p>
<p>the church are in the hands of the enemies of toleration, and that

<p>At our colleges are formed the cancers whofe fibres extend
</p>
<p>throughevery part of our religious and political fyftems  andthrough
</p>
<p>this caufe our religion is in the hands of fuch men as formerly ru-
</p>
<p>ined it, and our civil interefts in the hands of fuch men, as have
</p>
<p>always been enemies to them ; and with every advantage in their
</p>
<p>hands, they exhibit an annual, or femi-annual, triumph in the vi<flo-
</p>
<p>ries, which they gain over men, who have nothing to promife to
</p>
<p>their adherents.
</p>
<p>An event, which occurred at the moment of my writing this, en-
</p>
<p>ables me to exemplify thef remarks. The harbingers of the public
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>eletflion here* were, ifl:. Greenes newfpaper, containing two grofs
</p>
<p>falfehoods  viz. that congrefs had augmented the falaries of the
</p>
<p>pubhc officers, and that the French nation had demanded of our
</p>
<p>government a loan of fix milHons. The pradice of ufhering ia
</p>
<p>fuch days by falfehoods has been common with the church and
</p>
<p>ftate unioniih ; but they had been generally contented with poif-
</p>
<p>oning the public mind by the newfpapers ; on this occafion,
</p>
<p>however the moderator of the meeting (Mr. Daggett) and one of
</p>
<p>the candidates for office (Mr. Goodrich) had taken particular
</p>
<p>pains to ciroilatc thefe. Had thefe men faid, that congrefs gave no
</p>
<p>more than what had been paid for three years paft, and no more than
</p>
<p>what had been voted by the federalifts under the adminiftration of
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams; and had they faid, that a report had been circulated
</p>
<p>about a requifition of a loan, but that it had been publicly contra-
</p>
<p>dicted, that It was a mere eledtioneering ftory, and that they believed
</p>
<p>nothing of it, there would have been fome dignity and fairnefs in all
</p>
<p>this : but it feems that any means are good enough to humble
</p>
<p>heretics.
</p>
<p>The fecond harbinger was a political fermon from the Rev. Dr.
</p>
<p>Dana on the preceding fabbath. The third, an admiflion of two
</p>
<p>men to the freedom of the ftate, who had no claim to it by law.
</p>
<p>Thefe were a tutor and butler from college, and there was no pretence
</p>
<p>that they had the legal qualifications : but it was dated by Mr,
</p>
<p>Daggett and Mr. Goodrich, that it had been the practice in the ftate
</p>
<p>to admit fuch. How far violations of the law in other parts of the
</p>
<p>ftate, or fimilar violations here on former occafions, could form a
</p>
<p>precedent to fandlion a breach of truft in the officers, who admitted
</p>
<p>thefe, may be a queftion for church and ftate cafuifts. If man may
</p>
<p>decide that a diploma is equal to 140 dollars in the lift, or real
</p>
<p>eftate worth 7 dollars per annum f,they may decide that three years
</p>
<p>education is equal to it  indeed feveral of the fenior clafs did apply
</p>
<p>to one of the feledtmen ; but there was no occafion for a new
</p>
<p>precedent this year. If thefe men would decide that a good trade
</p>
<p>was equal to a diploma, we would (hew them mechanics enough to

</p>
<p>that taxation ivithout reprefentatlon is the ejfence of tyranny ^ had become
</p>
<p>^abfolete, and fome thoufands of men in the ftate are taxed and yet
</p>
<p>are not fuffered to be reprefented.  But the fourth harbinger was a
</p>
<p>new eiedlion law. It had been found that church and ftate could
</p>
<p>not fully control votes given fecretly, and that the numbers of
</p>
<p>republican votes increafed ; the new law was therefore calculated
</p>
<p>to bring this control into vifible operation, and to produce a direct
</p>
<p>bias on the mind contrary to the freedom of fufFrage.;];,

<p>f Thefe are the only legal qualifications in Connedlicut.

<p>fliould rife and be counted.

<p>I'vvo clafles af men compofed the meeting  The one wholly op-
</p>
<p>pofed to, and the other in favor of the adminiftration of the Uni-
</p>
<p>ted States. The rft confifted of the Prefident of the college. Dr.
</p>
<p>Dwight, who had circulated Robifon and Barruel, and who had
</p>
<p>never ceafed to reprobate in the fevereft terms the republicans : The
</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Dana, who preaches /oAV/Va/fermons, and the Rev. Mr.
</p>
<p>Hubbard, an epifcopal clergym.an  thirteen lawyers  the officers of
</p>
<p>College, and a great number of diplomatic freeman, who had been
</p>
<p>at this and former occafions admitted  the body of merchants

</p>

</p>
<p>thefe, Noah Webfter, jun. Efq. and Stephen Twining, Efq.
</p>
<p>Thefe might have been clafTed under fome of the other heads, but
</p>
<p>they deferve particular notice, as the fir<i is the confervator of Mr.
</p>
<p>Jefferfon in politics, and fupervifor of nouns and pronouns ;* and
</p>
<p>thelaft a defender of the faith, and recording fecretary of the acad-
</p>
<p>emy of arts and fciences !
</p>
<p>Having mentioned this federal group, my fubjecH: will be benefit-
</p>
<p>ed by a view of the correal motives of each. Chridianity can never
</p>
<p>fail, but church and ftate religion is ruined if republicanifm pre-
</p>
<p>vails ; lawyers can never be a privileged order in a republic. Com-
</p>
<p>merce flourifhes moft in the neighbourhood of wooden walls, which
</p>
<p>are of monarchical conftruflion. Republicanifm places on a po-
</p>
<p>litical level the rich banker and the poor laborer, leaving to the
</p>
<p>firfl: no other pre-eminence than what his wealth will command :
</p>
<p>a condition of equal rights would reduce to the ranks fome men,
</p>
<p>who hold offices, becaufe they hold in contempt the body of thofe
</p>
<p>who have them in their gift: and as to feif-created confervators
</p>
<p>and academicians, they would never rife to the rank of privates in a
</p>
<p>republic.

<p>Will any page in hiftory prefent fuch a group of figures afTociated

</p>
<p>Men, who have profefTed much religion, and yet poffefs none, are
</p>
<p>highly enraged at having this fad fpread before the public. Men,
</p>
<p>found wandering wide of their duty, and charged publicly with this
</p>
<p>wandering, prefer refentment to contrition. All thofe who under
</p>
<p>felfifh motives profefs great zeal for public good, are diilreffed at
</p>
<p>detedlion, and a difclofure of tke means bv which the few govern
</p>
<p>the many, is high treafon againft the craftfmen. Under thefe im-
</p>
<p>preffions, I am aware that the lafl number will be denominated an
</p>
<p>outrage of all decency ; but it was high time that the world ihould
</p>
<p>have a little fpecimen of that liberty and equality, which have been
</p>
<p>fo much reprobated. Thefe place men on a political level, and
</p>
<p>embolden the humbleft citizen to fpeak freely of dignities, if they
</p>
<p>deferve it.
</p>
<p>Will any one aflc me, is this the return, which I make for ail the
</p>
<p>tendernefs, fmcerity and afFedion, with which I have been treated
</p>
<p>by the clergy and civilians ? Let me fcreen myff if from any impu-
</p>
<p>tation of ingratitude under the importance of my fubjed, which
</p>
<p>demands me to name the men and fa<5ts to which I refer, in order
</p>
<p>to fecure attention.
</p>
<p>Have I faid that our colleges cultivate hoftility againft the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of our country, and that the padions of our youth are fedu-
</p>
<p>loufly enlifted againft republicanifm ? Have I ftated two falfe-
</p>
<p>hoods, one political fermon, two freemen admitted contrary to
</p>
<p>law, and a new eledion ad, as intended unduly to bias the pub-
</p>
<p>lic mind ? Have I faid that one clergyman circulated Robifon and
</p>
<p>Barruel, and that another preached political fermons ? and have
</p>
<p>I prefented the enemies of our revolution, combined with the ene-
</p>
<p>mies of our civil policy, to fhew contempt for the conflituted author-

<p>fuppofe that there is no truth in all this, and in further advance of

</p>
<p>that a certain fet of fads refpeding thefe leaders exifts, which,

</p>
<p>Unwilling to offend the great men, whom I have named, it be-
</p>
<p>comes me to fay, th2it perhaps , they believe in all thefe fuppofitions,
</p>
<p>and are therefore honeft ; though I have no idea that this is the cafe.
</p>
<p>This balances my account with them ; but it may be well to enable
</p>
<p>the reader to regard great men more on the principles of liberty
</p>
<p>and equality, than he has been accuftomed to do, and for this pur-
</p>
<p>pofe, I will drip them of Vv'hatimpofes on the public mind.

<p>Is a great man poffeffed of fuperior talents, and is he therefore
</p>
<p>haughty ? Give the credit to the beflower of his talents, and render

<p>to him your complaint, that they have been worfe than buried in

<p>the earth. Is he endowed with a great fund of knowledge, refult-
</p>
<p>ingfrom advantages of education, which you have not enjoyed ?
</p>
<p>and does he for this claim to lord it over you ? Examine who af-
</p>
<p>forded him thefe advantages, who endowed the inftitution which
</p>
<p>he enjoyed, who labored in the fieM to fupport him at (ludy ; and
</p>
<p>?ik yourfelves whetlier all thefe' ought to fink and be humbled
</p>
<p>before him ? Does he command an army ? Examine who lights,

<p>bleeds and dies, to win his lauy'els, and then refolve in yourfelves,
</p>
<p>whether the trade of war has fuperior claims to the veneration of
</p>
<p>humanity ? Does he preach to you the gofpel, and does he claim
</p>
<p>your earthly homage, and the guidance of your political faith ?
</p>
<p>Examine the hiftory of him, whom he calls his mafter. Does he
</p>
<p>promife you public favors, if you will aid him in promotion ? See

<p>that from yourfelves he gained the power of promifing, and that he

<p>is placing you an almoner on the bounty, which you furnifl-ied.

<p>The humiliation with which men have regarded the wealth and
</p>
<p>power which have been infidioufly drawn from them, has been a
</p>
<p>leading caufe of all the flavery on earth. You naturally venerate
</p>
<p>religion and government. The minilters of each apply this vene-
</p>
<p>ration to themfelves. You fit down content with the appropriation,
</p>
<p>and thereafter worfuip the man in power, as the papift worfliips
</p>
<p>{he image, each profefling that a vifible objed enlivens his devo-
</p>
<p>tions : Hence is the habitual idea, that if you remove the man, or
</p>
<p>the image, you remove the lubitance. Liberty and religion can
</p>
<p>i^ever confili with fuch fenfelefs idolatry.
</p>
<p>By thefe plain remarks I have no intention of diverting you from
</p>
<p>what will be termed the impudence of my laft number, in fuggefHng
</p>
<p>a want of piety and political integrity in fome of the clergy and
</p>
<p>^_ Jl^ ^
</p>
<p>civilians. Let me iipologize to thofe, who may be offended at thi.-:,
</p>
<p>by declaring that I do not believe in the piety of the one, nor the
</p>
<p>integrity of the other. It might be fjfficient to fay that they have
</p>
<p>never furnifhed evidence in their favor ; but I apprehend that an
</p>
<p>ample ftatement of the caufes, which have produced my unbehef
</p>
<p>in thefe men, will difpofe of a valuable part of this fubject. The
</p>
<p>very firft afpect is deadening to the pretenfions of thefe men
</p>
<p>that Hamilton, Bayard, Governeur Morris, Henderfon, Rut-
</p>
<p>ledge, Dana, Grifwold, and fuch men, fhould be affociated with
</p>
<p>certain clergymen under the name and firm of religion, and Co. to
</p>
<p>defend chrilUanity againfl infidels, liberty againil the body of
</p>
<p>mankind, and to lave the people from their worft enemies, them"
</p>
<p>fehes s that thefe men have evidences of their ov/n honefl zeal
</p>
<p>within their own breafls, which force them often to exclaim,
</p>
<p>* O how honed, O how pious we are !' and yet that this evidence
</p>
<p>fhould never appear in their a<flions, fo as to perfiade the people,
</p>
<p>are ftrong facfts ; but they are not new fa6ts  t/je liberttes of ma7i'
</p>
<p>kind ivere never dejiroyed by any other clafs of men. In the private
</p>
<p>walks of life, temptations are not potent enough to call men to
</p>
<p>rifque reputation on duplicity ; but the temptations of wealth,
</p>
<p>dignity and power, juft within reach of one additional effort, will
</p>
<p>affociate and bind together men of very incongruous profefliohs,
</p>
<p>whofe union appears to be diflradlion, till you look forward and fee
</p>
<p>that the fame felfifh objed engroffes the affections of them all.
</p>
<p>The fa6l of clergy ^s aiTociating with known infddsy in order to

<p>any proftituted fabbaths to political ledures I Yes, thefe men have
</p>
<p>done all this, and in doing it, have lod irretrievably that reputa-

<p>tion for fandity, fincerity and truth, which otherwife they might
</p>
<p>have enjoyed, and this failure they denominate a decay of religion.
</p>
<p>There was a time when the entire clefgy of two churches, (the
</p>
<p>Jewifli and the Romifh) were falfe to their religions  yet men con-
</p>
<p>tinued to revere them, afcer their power was gone.  We rightful-
</p>
<p>?y charged the higher orders of the Englifh epifcopacy with fimi-
</p>
<p>iar tendencies to impoflure at afeafon, when thoufands flood ready
</p>
<p>for worldly ends, to attefl their fandity. Within our memories
</p>
<p>one ciafsof our clergy charged another with herefy, pharifaifm and
</p>
<p>;mpoflure, v/hen the denounced clafs ftood high in the confidenc?;
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>ef their followers. Now all ecclefiaftical difcord is hufned, and
</p>
<p>the pailions which fuftained them are directed againfl: France, Jef-
</p>
<p>ferfon, toieratioa and republicanifm. Thefe fads lead us to be-
</p>
<p>lieve it poinble that all is not right in our Zion, and when clergy-

<p>men are at the head of a party in oppofition to our government, they
</p>
<p>embolden us to fay that fuch clergymen are not pious chriftians.
</p>
<p>This country affords as high fcafoned food for ambition as any
</p>
<p>before it, and as gready appetites to devour it. A pretence of
</p>
<p>religion is now as profitable to the politician, as it ever has been :
</p>
<p>this profit he can never gain, unlefs the key-keepers of the people's
</p>
<p>confciences and honeft confidence vyill affilt him in gaining it, and
</p>
<p>the imagination of man cannot prefent to him any fet of fa6ts more
</p>
<p>indicative of this (hte of things, than the fet, which is already
</p>
<p>furnifhed by the diffeminators of Robifon and Barruel and the
</p>
<p>preachers of e]e<fl:ioneering fermons. If to have faved appearances,
</p>
<p>thofe clergy, who affeEt to believe that infidelity is growing with the
</p>
<p>growth of republicanifm, had gathered about them men of unquef-
</p>
<p>tionable fan6lity, had carefully guarded their own lives, had fuffer-
</p>
<p>ed no evil and bitter words to efcape their lips, and had driven far
</p>
<p>from them thofe, who were following them merely for the profits
</p>
<p>of their influence, they would have rifen far above ourreprehenfions :
</p>
<p>but they have defcended to the level of equalit}^, by admitting not
</p>
<p>only the privileged orders of decent manners and hereditary impor-
</p>
<p>tance, but the mo ft indecent of partizans, back-biters, inventors of
</p>
<p>evil things  the implacable, the unmerciful, and the whole catalogue
</p>
<p>recorded in the firft chapter of Romans, to afiift them in alarming
</p>
<p>the world for the fafety of the church. This v/as pufliing their
</p>
<p>influence too far, and the confequence to them will be the fame,
</p>
<p>Tvhich has happened to their predeccfix)rs in former ages and coun-
</p>
<p>tries. Men have fuffered and bled too much to fuffer again tamely
</p>
<p>an union of church and ftate.
</p>
<p>But a long lift of ponderous: names is introduced to heighten the

<p>charge of impudence on my laft number and to paralize my doubts

<p>theie really great men V Suppofe they are great men by nature, and
</p>
<p>education ; it has been the pleafure of God to fuffer great men to
</p>
<p>be the fcourges of the feveral countries where they exhibited their
</p>
<p>greatnefs, and we have no evidence that he is likely to change the
</p>
<p>order of his government. The courts &f Great-Britain, Germany
</p>
<p>and Ruflia, are thronged with fuch great men  and they always
</p>
<p>will be in abundance, where power and wealth are to be had, and
</p>
<p>they will put in their claims for thefe with a confidence impofing
</p>
<p>on the multitude. What is the great employ of thefe great men ?
</p>
<p>is it to adjuft the politics of this little ftate, which contains one
</p>
<p>fourth as many inhabitants as the city of London ? Separate from
</p>
<p>jobbmg about militia officers and juftices, and making and fupply-
</p>
<p>ing vacancies, abridging the right of i'affrage  trimming, riding
</p>
<p>of hobby horfes, and contriving ways and means to abufe the gen-
</p>
<p>eral government, what mighty concerns has this ftate for, the
</p>
<p>talents of thefe great men ?* I know that they have great concerns
</p>
<p>and objeds of their own ; but thefe are fzf diftant from the inter-
</p>
<p>efts of the people : therefore they keep them cautioufly within
</p>
<p>their own lodges.
</p>
<p>Has any man difcovered that laws will be moft accurately made
</p>
<p>by men, whd live and thrive in proportion to the inaccuracy and
</p>
<p>uncertainty of laws ? Are thefe men tenderly concerned for an
</p>
<p>equality of rights ? Then they differ from all other great men before
</p>
<p>them. Is it the caufe and kingdom of Chriil, which requires
</p>
<p>their great talents ? But the Saviour never chofe fuch men as his
</p>
<p>champions  he placed no confidence in them, they never did him
</p>
<p>any good ; they have in all ages and nations been the leaders of his
</p>
<p>enemies, and have eftablifhed a kingdom, where the lufts of the
</p>
<p>fiefh, the lufts of the eye, and the pride of life, have been predomi-
</p>
<p>nant. Are federal lawyers anxioufly concerned for the welfare of
</p>
<p>community, and for fecuring to induftry the bread, which it has
</p>
<p>earned.? if fo, when did they leave the fteady habits of their pro-
</p>
<p>feffion, and become advocates for equal rights ? If my ideas ref-
</p>
<p>peding thefe great men are wrong, then God has made a new
</p>
<p>world, reverfing the order of the old, has made the body of man-
</p>
<p>kind the worft enemies of themfelves, and has appointed thofe,
</p>
<p>who ufed to be their worft enemies, their confervators ; but your
</p>
<p>experience, if you dare ufe it, will confirm my impreffions. Stop
</p>
<p>the cry of* religion is in danger,' drive the political clergy either inta
</p>
<p>or out of their pulpits, break the league between church and ftate,
</p>
<p>which firft fubjugates your confciences, then treating your under-
</p>
<p>ftandings as galley-flaves, robs you of religious and civil liberty,
</p>
<p>then aflcs fneeringly what you have loft  break thefe liliputian ties,
</p>
<p>and thefe great human glories would be like the ruins of ancient
</p>
<p>cities.
</p>
<p>But how arrives it that thefe great men, fome of whom are really-
</p>
<p>great, and fome very moderate, fliould all trade under the firm of.
</p>
<p>Great men and Co ? Does the circumftance of thefe laft, having

<p>Talmadge, Theodore Dwight, Timothy Pitkin, jun. and Syl-

<p>vefter Gilbert, great men ?f If fo, ye little men, rejoice that yoa
</p>
<p>* On this fubjedl I am obliged to exemplify my remarks, moftly from
</p>
<p>names and fadts within the very limited region of this (late ; but the forma-
</p>
<p>tion of this union is fimiiar throughout New-England.
</p>
<p>f Thefe men fufFer their names to be given to the public, as enemies to the
</p>
<p>general government, and if any word oracftion Ibould bring into queftion this
</p>
<p>comity, they would lofe all chance of promotion.  It would feem natural
</p>
<p>that a people of republican habits, Ciouid choole men of the fame habits, to-
</p>
<p>belong to another clafs : but in the language of churcli and (late,
</p>
<p>thefe are great men  and your legiHators have made laws, whicli
</p>
<p>will induce every timid man to join the phalanx of church and ftate,
</p>
<p>in declaring them to be great men, and there is a common law in
</p>
<p>force for reg^ding as friends of order and good government, all who
</p>
<p>thu3 arrive at greatnefs.
</p>
<p>If thefe were really the great men, which they are reprefented to
</p>
<p>be, you have no concerns of fufficient magnitude for their talents. 
</p>
<p>Your religion is really in danger ; but the danger is from thefe
</p>
<p>great men. Your rights may be invaded : but thefe great men
</p>
<p>will be the invaders. Your property may be in hazard : but there
</p>
<p>are ten chances oFyour houfes and lands being fet off on executions
</p>
<p>to thefe great m.en, to one of their being feized by a foreign power.
</p>
<p>The interefts of yo^r colleges may be neglected : bat thefe great
</p>
<p>men have already enlifted thofe intereds againfl: the general gov-
</p>
<p>ernment  and one of the profefTors of our college, (Mr. Marlh)
</p>
<p>declared, " that Mr. Jefferfon's meafures would bring on a mon-
</p>
<p>archy, and he was glad of it, for it was the beft: form of govern-
</p>
<p>ment.*'* Here is a fentiment for the fons of the heroes of 1776.
</p>
<p>Peace may be violated ; but thefe great men have declared for
</p>
<p>war  the union of the ftates may be diffolved ; but their wilh to do
</p>
<p>this has been announced. The v/ant of integrity in thefe great
</p>
<p>men, confifts in their having confined the fecrets of their politics
</p>
<p>to the few, who are to agitate the people, and in their having con-
</p>
<p>cealed from their electors the true prelTure of the times  pretend-
</p>
<p>ing to love ixjhat they hate, and thus fecuring to themfelves the pow-
</p>
<p>er of feizing into their own hands, thofe religious and civil privileges,
</p>
<p>which fuch a clafs of men never left for any long time unviolated.
</p>
<p>Thefe allegations open the ground, which will be taken in a future
</p>
<p>number, and fliew the points of danger to be apprehended.
</p>
<p>If thefe great men pretend that thefe are chimeras, let them
</p>
<p>change their ground :  Let the laws be repealed, which fecure their
</p>
<p>places : let the old dodrine of reprefentat'ion and taxation wfepara-
</p>
<p>hie be revived, let all who contribute to the public burdens, be ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to a vote : let the young men, who labor, that others may

<p>the owners of thefe ponderous names throw them into commoa
</p>
<p>flock, and the refult would be conclufive proof that, though every
</p>
<p>thing elfe has been reprefented, yet that the voice of the people has
</p>
<p>not been heard in congrefs or council. Till our revolution, tiic

<p>rfprefent them ; but the people know and do very little on this fubjecft. /*

<p>ftate, they will fucceed, fo long as religion is fuffered to be fubordinate ta

<p>dillina voice of the people had not been heard for a century in any

<p>quarter of the globe. For a feafon it was neceffary, to call our
</p>
<p>people fovereign  to raife their paffions, to ex^cite their courage,
</p>
<p>and to pay them for fatigues, expences and hazards, in, promifes of
</p>
<p>a golden age : but the tinfel of that day has worn off. Men have
</p>
<p>been gradually brought back to the old order of things ;  the badg-
</p>
<p>es of flavery have been worn as ornaments  the fervices of the old
</p>
<p>foldier are forgotten  the name of liberty defpifed  the lords of
</p>
<p>our new world cry, ' follow us, and we will lead you to wealth and

<p>IN EW England has always taken to it/elf the credit of a
</p>
<p>great ftock of piety, hereditary and acquired, and many of its citi-
</p>
<p>zens have been extremely gratified in a belief that the world acquief-
</p>
<p>ed in this credit ; but if any fuch citizen wifhes to know the truth,
</p>
<p>and will take the trouble to crofs Byram river, and make enquiry, he
</p>
<p>will find himfelf in a grofs miftake, and that the whole of this buz
</p>
<p>about piety is confined within our own boundaries. Since the fate of
</p>

<p>aflowed to read, and believed as they were told : there was enough
</p>
<p>of public learning, but little of that fubftantial knowledge, which
</p>
<p>rcfults from correal: information and un reft rifled refledlion. It
</p>
<p>was the happieit feafon for pretences of piety to ufurp dominion.

<p>Church andftatc lofl no ground, it plied men v/ith ofHces, fuitf-d

<p>32
</p>
<p>to their capacities, accepted profeflion in lieu of praftice from
</p>
<p>weak finners, multiplied forms of devotion, and took pofleffion of
</p>
<p>the fears, hopes ambition, all the paffions  and thus prepared,
</p>
<p>drove on the revolution, which appeared to promife unlimited
</p>
<p>power to its union. Providence fuffered church and ftate to fall
</p>
<p>into this ambufcade for the exprefs purpofe of its diflblution. In
</p>
<p>the fcenes of the war they loft men and artillery : many of their
</p>
<p>devotees, joining the caufe of their country in arms, joined its
</p>
<p>interefts in their hearts, and only waited the moment, when this
</p>
<p>formidable union, expofed in front and rear, might be completely
</p>
<p>routed. Under the new government, there has been a temporary
</p>
<p>appearance, that church and ftate had regained its ground ; but this
</p>
<p>will prove deceitful as the firft. At the prefent moment, more
</p>
<p>than 30,000 freemen of New-England hold a decided attitude
</p>
<p>againft this union : more than an equal number, whom the unionifts
</p>
<p>deprive of voting, becaufe they are not rich or learned enough^ are
</p>
<p>ready to join them. A faithful underftanding of the arts, by
</p>
<p>which the followers are held, would render ineffective any future
</p>
<p>alarms about the danger of religion.
</p>
<p>At the outfet thefe leaders have the fame advantages as the
</p>
<p>leading Jews had over the firft chriftians. Thofe could fn^eer at
</p>
<p>the preachers of a new religion, becaufe they had neither purfe nor
</p>
<p>fcrip, and becaufe their leader was poor. They could fay to the
</p>
<p>multitude, " we have Abraham for our father, we are ancient ; to
</p>
<p>*' us the lav/ was given, and to us the interpretation of it : ours are
</p>
<p>** the fynagogues  and the feats of juftice. The leader of this
</p>
<p>** new fe(5l threatened to deftroy our temple, his followers are fet-

</p>
<p>the fame in fubftance, and nearly the fame in terms. Men worfiiip
</p>
<p>elevation without regarding the fteps vs/hich led to it ; and he,
</p>
<p>who plays earth againft heaven, calculates with a good fhare of

<p>v/orldly wifdom, becaufe fuch players have been generally fuccefsful.

<p>chriftianity has never taken ; at the fame time a road, which every
</p>
<p>man with us has been obliged to take, or to lofe all chance of
</p>
<p>political promotion. It may feem at firft, that confidering the
</p>
<p>few tempting offices, which church and ftate has in its gift, this
</p>
<p>impreftion could not be cxtenfive ; but we are to recollect, that
</p>
<p>a mole-hill is a kingdom to an ant, and that church and ftate has
</p>
<p>in its gift, feveral thoufands of oftices, which are diftributed with
</p>
<p>a liberality equalled only by the fidelity, with which they are paid
</p>
<p>for. A man of- real religion, would not facrifice it for the domin-
</p>
<p>ion of a continent ; but he, who lias none, 'may pretend to have it,
</p>
<p>for the office of a grand-juror or tythlngman. Be it that thefe are
</p>
<p>fmall things, yet the main fpring of a watch is fufficient to move
</p>
<p>the machine in which it is p'aqed.

</p>
<p>Tills operation does not indeed extend to the whole body of
</p>
<p>our people : fome have fears of public oppreflion  fome of inva-
</p>
<p>fion ; but the great rnafs is moved by confiderations of religion.
</p>
<p>Here is a field of adion, in which our unionifts move with fuc-
</p>
<p>cefs  real chriftianity would not anfwer their purpofes ; but fome-
</p>
<p>thing called by this name was indifpen fable. If this religion had
</p>
<p>been founded by fuch a MefFiah as the Jews expedled ; if his fol-
</p>
<p>lowers had been the chief priefts and counfellors : if it had en-
</p>
<p>couraged every fpecies of deceit and foftered every paffion, it would
</p>
<p>have been highly popular : our unionifts would have been eminent
</p>
<p>pra(5litioners in it ; but it was oppofed to fuch men and all their
</p>
<p>obje<5l:5 : they faw this, and openly warred againft it, crucified its
</p>
<p>author, fcattered his followers, and proudly calculated on its over-
</p>
<p>throw. As the Egyptians were overwhelmed in purfuing their
</p>
<p>anceftors, fo they were overwhelmed in purfuing the chriltians :
</p>
<p>but judaifm was a name, which defignd.ttd a Jyjiem of pajjions ;
</p>
<p>therefore, though the fynagogue-enemies of chri(tianity were dii-
</p>
<p>perfed, its cathedral enemies arofe in abundance, and followingr
</p>
<p>another example, profeffed great reverence for the Saviour, and in
</p>
<p>the adl: of betraying him with a kifs, aimed a dagger at his caufe.
</p>
<p>This was found the fafeft mode of confpiring againil this religion ;
</p>
<p>for the multitude faw the devotions but the dagger was concealed.
</p>
<p>Working on this fyftem, which long experience has proved to be
</p>
<p>certain, our preaching politicians, with their aflbciated civilians,
</p>
<p>have fairly doubled the cape, and come round to the people with
</p>
<p>a religion of their own fabrication, a religion often fuflained by ,..>
</p>
<p>founded al((^ms, tending to public offices  always headed by world-
</p>
<p>lings : not comely as Jerufalem by reafon of its moral charms,
</p>
<p>nor terrible as an army with banners through the force of its pre-
</p>
<p>cepts ; but odious through the expreflion of the moll: malignant
</p>
<p>paffions, and terrible only, becaufe thefe paflions are vomited forth
</p>
<p>in every frightful form upon thofe v/ho deny It to be chrif-
</p>

<p>into heaven ; yet in the character of key-keepers of that world,
</p>
<p>have men claimed to hold the honors and emoluments of this. Re-
</p>
<p>fledling men never believed that tl:e popes and cardinals, and bench
</p>
<p>of bilhops, were pious chridians : their rank, pomp and power, bar
</p>
<p>fuch behef. Such men do not believe, that our prelates, who are
</p>
<p>handing about their political ware, with a hep this fide up, are pious
</p>
<p>chriftians ; yet all thefe men are powerful : humble, fincere
</p>
<p>preachers are obliged to gain their favor in order to admiffion, and
</p>
<p>they dare not offend them. No refleding man believes that chrif-
</p>
<p>tianity is committed to the holy keeping of twenty or thirty men,
</p>
<p>and that it would decline, if they fhould drop out of our nomina-
</p>
<p>tion ; yet a procefs of operating through interefted men, upor
</p>
<p>the honef^, credulous, unthinking nart of community, has b?-a
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>invented by our unionids, which completely blinds thofe eyes,
</p>
<p>whofe vifion would detedt, and whofe fincerity would expofe their
</p>
<p>hypocrify.
</p>
<p>The fird part of this procefs is to declare, that all thefe preach-
</p>
<p>ers are ambafladors from God. Tkis is precifely falfe, provided
</p>
<p>by this it ie meant to exhibit them as coming from the court of
</p>
<p>heaven with a knowledge of the will and interefts of that court,
</p>
<p>and with full power to treat v/ith man on the terms of the gofpel.
</p>
<p>If this were a fact, they would all come with the fame errand, and
</p>
<p>dwell often and powerfully on thofe important duties, the practice
</p>
<p>of which makes men wifer and better. Were they ambafladors,
</p>
<p>they would find enough to do in their mafter's work, and would
</p>
<p>never intermeddle with the politics of this world. If by this it is
</p>
<p>meant that, after receiving their education, they chofe this pro-
</p>
<p>feflion, that they know no more about it, than what they have learnt
</p>
<p>-and that if it fails them as a means of fupport, they expeft to
</p>
<p>turn to fome other employment, an abundance of facls is at hand to
</p>
<p>fliew all this to be true ; but the old dod:rine of fucceffion, which
</p>
<p>has been claimed by every divifion and fed in Chridendom, is
</p>
<p>denied to be true by three fourths of profeiTing chriftians, as refpcdls
</p>
<p>all but themfelves. Who will acknowledge that Dr. Prieftly
</p>
<p>and Mr. Murray, have been divinely fent to preach Unitarianifm
</p>
<p>and univerfal falvation ? or will thefe preachers acknowledge that
</p>
<p>others oppofed to them are on a divine miffion ? Can the Calvinift
</p>
<p>agree, that the Arminian preacher is an ambaffador of heaven, or
</p>
<p>can the protedant agree, that the Catholics are the heralds of
</p>
<p>truth ? Each clafs muft acknov/ledge his own variance from the

<p>damnation on him who doubts it ? The man who attempts this, ought
</p>
<p>indeed to come from God with teftimonials of divine million, not
</p>
<p>inferior to thole of his mafter. If a man, by this claim of being
</p>
<p>an arabaifador, means nothing, only to give confequence to what
</p>
<p>he may fay, tliis is bad enough : If he intends by it, asfome Cath-
</p>
<p>olics have done, that he can work miracles, and that he cannot err,
</p>
<p>it is intolerable. In fadt, if any thing is intended by it equal to the
</p>
<p>obvious meaning of the term, the object is to impofe on the people :
</p>
<p>for the flightefl: obfervation teaches that it cannot poflibly be ttiie 
</p>
<p>and that though all ecclefiaftics fliould agree to addrefs men in
</p>
<p>this charadler, yet they never would bear it, in one inftance as ad-
</p>
<p>drcfled to themfelves by a clergyman of oppofite tenets.
</p>
<p>6b
</p>
<p>But this irapofing attitude of the clergy gains immediate fupport
</p>
<p>from the fervices attached to their office. He who baptizes your
</p>
<p>children, who admits you to communion, and who follows the
</p>
<p>remains of yor friends to the grave, has great advantages of im-
</p>
<p>prefling you. In the middling fcenes of life, the affe5tions are
</p>
<p>neutralized ; but he who attends the moil joyful and mod melan-
</p>
<p>choly fcenes, is mofl: likely to fecure your good opinion and confi-
</p>
<p>dence. He who wifhes for your hearts, muft be with you, either
</p>
<p>when you rejoice or when you weep : but the fable drefs  the
</p>
<p>ftudied manners, apt exprellions of concern for fouls, and the eleva
</p>
<p>tion ot fubjeift, are all calculated to aid the work of impreffion.
</p>
<p>fs his voice heard on that day, when every thing elfe is ftili, and
</p>
<p>does he fpeak of heaven ? Is his voice folemn ? Does he fpeak v/ith
</p>
<p>pathos ? Does he weep ? All this may be fincere ; but nature never
</p>
<p>learnt one of her children to whine  to tone, to ftand like a
</p>
<p>ftatue, or fpeak* as when a lion roareth. The preacher has no
</p>
<p>news to tell you ; the hS.s and doctrines, of which he fpeaks, have
</p>
<p>been in the world long before him. The condiuon of man is no new
</p>
<p>calamity, and if he imagines in his clofet that he has made fome
</p>
<p>great difcovery, let him ponder well on what the world already
</p>
<p>knows, before he comes forward with the ufual parade of an in-
</p>
<p>venting machinift. The preacher may ufefully illuftrate and apply
</p>
<p>ancient truths, and his fincere belief of them will always diflate a
</p>
<p>manner of addrefs, equally diftant from that of a (larched prelate
</p>
<p>on a fejftival, and a ranting preacher in the fields. Agues and
</p>
<p>fevers are prejudicial to foundnefs in religion as in the human con-
</p>
<p>ilitution..
</p>
<p>It is as impoffible for us to be really affefled at what we have
</p>
<p>heard and read a thoufand times, as it is for grafs to fpring up in a
</p>
<p>path conftantly beaten. It is natural to be impreffed by impor-
</p>
<p>tant truths, delivered in a manner indicative of their proceeding
</p>
<p>from the heart. Does your preacher fpend any fabbaths in polit-
</p>
<p>ical harangues ? Does he find texts in the old and new-tefta-
</p>
<p>ments, which lead him to abufe the general government ? Set down

<p>a chriftian. A (rage-player might out-adt him. But is he gifted

<p>they may be pradifed with equal eafe by the hypocrite and the

<p>faint.
</p>
<p>Church and flate always works by human means, and as its mofl:
</p>
<p>powerful engine is the influence of the political clergy upon the
</p>
<p>pafBons of the people, the eftablifliment of this influence has been
</p>
<p>0.6
</p>
<p>the firft point of attention. The claim of diyine milTion is care-
</p>
<p>fully wrapt up in a multiplicity of impreflive exteriors, and the
</p>
<p>people are prepared to believe a religion, the details of which will
</p>
<p>occupy the next number.
</p>
<p>NO. Fin.

<p>View cf tie foUoimrs of Church and State, in fyrnu and
</p>
<p>profrffiom.
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>HE variety of matter, which this number prefents, will
</p>
<p>oblige me to make as rapid tranfitions as may confifl: with my
</p>
<p>touching thofe points, which may lead to a diflinft perception of
</p>
<p>the religion of church and ftate, as dKHnguirtied from chrlftianity. 
</p>
<p>The unionifl: would gain nothing by fecuting that portion of man-
</p>
<p>kind, who are willing to be religious on the terras of the gofpel ;
</p>
<p>they would not be half fufficient to fecure an election. It is his
</p>
<p>policy to difpofe of heaven on ealier terms. A view of thefe
</p>
<p>terms forms my prefent fubjedl:.
</p>
<p>It will be readily agreed that the clergy and meeting-houfes,
</p>
<p>prayers and fermons, are not religion any more than a machine is
</p>
<p>iabor ; yet the habit of regarding them as fuch has deftroyed one
</p>
<p>half the religion of our country. It will be alfo agreed, that the
</p>
<p>belief of every truth without pradlice is of no avail ; yet the habit
</p>
<p>of regarding a good creed as the moft important part of religion has
</p>
<p>weakened the other half. Again, the idea of fome men, that
</p>
<p>they can purfiie this v/orid with all their might and ftrength through
</p>
<p>week-days, andiieaven on fundays, and gain both, is well connect-
</p>
<p>ed with the other two, and as external devotion, at feafons when
</p>
<p>we have nothing elfe to do, is a cheap depofit for glory, and as be-
</p>
<p>lieving is lefs ccllly than alms-giving, the worldling takes up this
</p>
<p>bulinels in all its confifbnt parts, and quarrels bitterly with any
</p>
<p>man, who utters a belief that he loves this world better than the
</p>
<p>other, and that his fan edification is merely outvv'ard.
</p>
<p>Arriving at this point of dtfinition, the habitual followers of
</p>
<p>church and (tate will be ready to exclaim, " They, who difturb

</p>
<p>temples and our altars, and will take away the veflels of our fandu-
</p>
<p>ary ;" and in order to excite the multitude In their favor, will fay.
</p>
<p>Have we not communed ? Have we not prayed ? Have we not
</p>
<p>faid, Lord, Lord ? All this you have doubtlcfs done, and fo did
</p>
<p>men anciently, whofe chance was quite inferior to that of the in-
</p>
<p>habitants of Tyre and Sydon.
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>But if an obfervance of days and forms, and an abundant creed,
</p>
<p>conneded with a prevailing love of the world, are not true religion,
</p>
<p>fo the nioji perfeSi fanBity of face^ and moji obfequious reverence of
</p>
<p>the clergy, are not religion ; yet when a wealthy, powerful man
</p>
<p>afTociates all thefe, and attends public worfhip, our very charitable
</p>
<p>world is too apt to confider that he renders great honor to the
</p>
<p>Saviour, by fitting gravely in a well furniihed pew to hear about
</p>
<p>the gofpel.
</p>
<p>Juftice cannot be done to this fubjeifl without looking beyond
</p>
<p>thefe forms, and in doing this, we rnuft give up the old cant, ' that
</p>
<p>furely we will not be fo uncharitable as to doubt man's profeffions.'
</p>
<p>Why are we not as candid on other fubjeds ? Plainly becaufe we
</p>
<p>Ihould be cheated and lofe money ; but in religion it is cheap,
</p>
<p>handy change.  * Do you believe me (incere, and I will believe
</p>
<p>you fo, and we will confound any who doubt us.' This game is
</p>
<p>played fo regularly, that probably every reader may knov/ of in-
</p>
<p>ilances, where profeffing brethren are in the exercife of this chari-
</p>
<p>ty, and yet would not truft each other to the amount of a dollar,
</p>
<p>merely from a want of confidence in each, that the other has in-
</p>
<p>tegrity.
</p>
<p>Let ds confider to what this profeffion amounts in a private
</p>
<p>chrillian. " Gbd has chofen me from the millions of men to be
</p>
<p>" aveffel of mercy, has infufed into me his grace, and with it the
</p>
<p>" beft of moral principles, and has made himfelf an objedt of my
</p>
<p>*' fupreme affeftion, and me in return an obje6t of his complacency.*'
</p>
<p>Now in courts we never take a man's evidence in favor of a fingle
</p>
<p>point in his own character, and if in private life one was to profefs
</p>
<p>half as much about himfelf, we fiiouid diftruft him ; but in reli-
</p>
<p>gion, profeffion is to pafs for full evidence, and habit has fo im-
</p>
<p>prefTed this idea, that if fuch a profefTor is difhoneft, or other wife
</p>
<p>immoral, our very charitable world is ready to fay, ' there are re-
</p>
<p>mainders of corruption in the bed, or the chriflian graces are noi
</p>
<p>always in exercife ;' and wrapped in fuch mantles of charity, the

<p>very devoutly joins in that fatirical clofe of prayer, fo cu.ftomary on
</p>
<p>facramental fundays, * Lord have mercy on thofe, who have not
</p>
<p>publicly taken on themfelves the bonds of this covenant,' meaning
</p>
<p>thereby \.ha.t this public taking is a divine ordinance, and that it is
</p>
<p>good evidence of grace ; whereas God never ordained it, and the
</p>
<p>life only can be an evidence of grace. Let us look at this again.
</p>
<p>This PUBLIC TAKING certainly is not a divine ordinance, for it is
</p>
<p>not found in the fcriptures, and as to evidence, when a man has
</p>
<p>every inducement to teftify, and the teftimony cannot be impeach-
</p>
<p>ed, and the refult will be very honorable and beneficial, we ihould
</p>
<p>look cautioufly at fuch teftimony ; it it be followed by any confid-
</p>
<p>erable exhibition of remainders of corruption, and if the man's life
</p>
<p>proves that he loves the creature more than the Creator, his pro-
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>fellions will not gain credit with any, but his hypocritical brethren,
</p>
<p>who wifii for a fimilar credit in return.
</p>
<p>I do not fuggeft a word againft the ordinance, nor againft
</p>
<p>the profefHons of faith and promifes of reformation, which confti-
</p>
<p>tute this public taking. If a man honeftly profefTes to believe what
</p>
<p>he does believe, aiid promifes to do what he intends to perform,
</p>
<p>furely he is no worfe for all this. It is his duty to believe the
</p>
<p>truth and to condudl well. This public taking is a mere recogni-
</p>
<p>tion of this duty, and his life is to be the tejl of his fmcerity : but if
</p>
<p>he believes and performs without any pablic promife, his fervices
</p>
<p>will be doubtlefs accepted. His public taking is a human inftitu-
</p>
<p>tion  not of ancient origin in the church : It is a form of religion,
</p>
<p>which deferves precifely as much refpedl as the lives of profjfors
</p>
<p>can gain for it. Habit has attached great folemnity to this form,
</p>
<p>and made it paramount to a life of piety : whereas it is a mere
</p>
<p>drefs, which may be put on as eafily by the fmner as the faint :
</p>
<p>Call it if you pleafe, a contrad made with God in prefence of man,
</p>
<p>yet it is only a contra<5i: ; every thing depends on faithful perfor-
</p>
<p>mance.  Without this it is mockery : yet the reader muft know
</p>
<p>that mankind are lead to think otherwife of it, and that hence a
</p>
<p>train of worldly confiderations leads up fome infmcere profeflbrs
</p>
<p>who, from the importance of keeping up the credit of profeflions,
</p>
<p>have drawn as great profits as could have beei derived from fmceri-
</p>
<p>ty and truth ; political promotion has been often among the firft
</p>
<p>fruits of the profeflbr's harveft.
</p>
<p>At this point the civilian has a right to attack thefe profeflions.
</p>
<p>When a man claims earthly honors and profits for his profeflions,
</p>
<p>we ought to turn him round to his religion and fay, * there is your
</p>
<p>reward'  and if his heart does not inftantly feel the force of the
</p>
<p>reprimand, he is an hypocrite ; he never made his profeflion from
</p>
<p>religious motives. Men have doubtlefs a right to commemorate as
</p>
<p>they pleafe the fufferings or triumphs of one whom they profefs to
</p>
<p>revere ; but if their laeighbors are to be called pagans or atheifts for
</p>
<p>not joining them in their mode, the fcene fliifts  a war of opinions;

<p>enfues, and the event proves that the pretext of honoring an abfent
</p>
<p>friend was ufed in order to difgrace and vilify a prefent opponent.
</p>
<p>When any form of religion like this, has been prefented to
</p>
<p>mankind, as religion itfelf and when men have been told, that a.
</p>
<p>public profeflbr is under greater obligations to love God and fervt
</p>
<p>his neighbor, than another man  that baptifm does not admit non-
</p>
<p>profefl'ors within the pale of the church, there is fo much theoiogy
</p>
<p>about ail this, that they become awed, and begin to confider it impi-
</p>
<p>ous even to lock into the propofition, left it fliould feem to imply
</p>
<p>doubt.  Pious men are not forward to exhibit their affedtions b?-
</p>
<p>fore the world ; but the defigning man is in hafte to avail himltit
</p>
<p>of this flavifh flate of the public mind, and to come forward with
</p>
<p>profeflions, which bring fuch an uiftant credit.
</p>
<p>We are apt to blend religion and man together, and to give the
</p>
<p>credit to profeffors, which is due only to their religion. Man is
</p>
<p>frail in his origin, acceffible by a thoufand improper^ motives, full
</p>
<p>of felf, governed by paffion naturally oppofed to religion, becaufe,
</p>
<p>tho* it feeks his beft good, yet it does this in modes hoftile to all
</p>
<p>his propenfities. Man has no pre-difpofition to vital religion, yet
</p>
<p>he has ftrong propenfities to the earthly profits of it. Sicknefs,
</p>
<p>loffes, exceffive fear, or powerful addreffes to his paflions, may oc-
</p>
<p>cafion him earneftly to wi(h for heaven and to dread hell for a fea-
</p>
<p>fon ; yet when the exciting caufe ceafes, the effea: often ceafes
</p>
<p>with it. If we confider the nature of man, and the earthly ad-
</p>
<p>vantages of profeflion, we may form fome eftimate of the propor-
</p>
<p>tion between the fincere andinfmcere profeffors, and of the credit
</p>
<p>due to mere profeflion. ^ j j
</p>
<p>When religion is confidered as a connexion between God and
</p>
<p>man, and is ftript of allthofe forms, which make it impofing on
</p>
<p>mankind, and very profitable to the profeffor, it pafTes above the
</p>
<p>region of church and ftate, is never heard on the houfe-tops, or
</p>
<p>at the corners of the ftreets never interpofes with political con-
</p>
<p>cerns never preaches ocean fermons  never prates about illumi-
</p>
<p>natifm ; but bettering the heart, regulating the affedions, morali-
</p>
<p>zing the life, flows out in love to man, and love to God, and looks
</p>
<p>through good anions, proceeding from the beft of motives, filent-
</p>
<p>ly to that heaven, where the humble fhall be exalted, the fincere
</p>
<p>rewarded, and the foul perfedly blefTed.
</p>
<p>In the early ages of the church, it required courage and iincer-
</p>
<p>ity to confefs Chrift before men, becaufe ftripes and contempt were
</p>
<p>the confequence; but when our anceftors bid the bounties of
</p>
<p>ofSceto profeffors, and declared that none but church members
</p>
<p>Jhould be free burgejes, it required neither of thefe : and furely m
</p>
<p>the prefent day, the importance given to thefe profefEons, the
</p>
<p>patronage attached to them, and the eafe of gaining heaven, when
</p>
<p>one half of the work is done with the tongue, has given to church
</p>
<p>and ftate a great hoft of followers, without adding to the number
</p>

<p>covers where he is.*
</p>
<p>In a vail of myfteries the Jewifh leaders wrapt up the law given
</p>
<p>to Mofes ; and thefe had fo completely enveloped the true religion
</p>
<p>at the coming ^ the Saviour, that it had nearly ceafed to be a
</p>
<p>commerce between God and man, and had become a mere bufi-
</p>
<p>nefs of barter between man and man, in which each leader gain-
</p>
<p>ed profits according to his portion of cunning  and each follower
</p>
<p>fuffered lofs in proportion to his credulity. The ceremonial law
</p>
<p>had nearly expelled the eternal duties of love to God and love to
</p>
<p>our neighbors. Oftentation had taken place of humility. The
</p>
<p>Jews, having failed of enjoying literally a long life in the land of
</p>
<p>Canaan, had long fince dKlrufted the promifes of heaven, and were
</p>
<p>in thtjieady habit of taking their change for profelTion, and myf-
</p>
<p>terious fervices of religion in tlie good things of this life. Bad
</p>
<p>as their religion was, yet it was all which they had, and was all

<p>reft was as founding brafs, was revealed in the plaineft terms.
</p>
<p>The Catholic church, finding that trading in myfteries had
</p>
<p>been profitable to the great worldly church which preceded them
</p>
<p>and that plain work would place too nearly on a leVel the prelate
</p>
<p>and the peafant, fet up a more extenfive fcheme of myfteries, and
</p>
<p>even called in the aid of pretended miracles to affift their impreflion.
</p>
<p>Thefe myfteries and miracles compofed the main body of their
</p>
<p>religion : There were fome detached doctrines an^ duties, which
</p>
<p>were treated as of little avail, where the myfteries wad taken good
</p>
<p>hold of the patients. Thefe myfteries were very convenient in
</p>
<p>furnifhing pretences to facrifice heretics and to embroil the world
</p>
<p>in wars. If a cloud preceded the deluge, thick and dreadful in
</p>
<p>proportion to the length of the ftorm ; yet that was not half fo
</p>
<p>portentous and black, as the cloud with which this myfterious
</p>
<p>church overfpread, for centuries, the civilized world.
</p>
<p>It is impoflible that a religion of humble faith, pure morals and
</p>
<p>fincere repentance fhould be relifhed by the leaders of the worlds
</p>
<p>If they profefs to revere it, yet they cannot feel its power and
</p>
<p>love its authority. The elements of chriftianity and thofe of hu-
</p>
<p>man paflions can never mix.  This religion joins with univerfal
</p>
<p>obfervation in teaching us, that the body of mankind do not love
</p>
<p>its duties nor pradlife its morals. The fad, which leads up this
</p>
<p>obfervation is equally ancient and ftriking : When Mofes delayed

<p>evident demonftrationsof a divine objed of worfhip, applied to
</p>
<p>Aaron to make them gods to go before them, and Aaron readiljf
</p>
<p>undertook the fervice and faid, break off the golden ear-rings
</p>
<p>which are on the ears of your wives, of your fons and your daugh-
</p>
<p>ters, and bring them unto me  and the people did fo, and Aaroa
</p>
<p>adually made them a molten calf, and he built an altar unto it, and
</p>
<p>appointed a feaft ; and when Mofes defcended from the mount,
</p>
<p>his wrath waxed hot, and he brake the tables of teftimony, writ-
</p>
<p>ten with the finger of God  and Aaron faid to Mofes, let not the
</p>
<p>anger of my lord wax hot ; thou knoweft the people, that they are
</p>
<p>fet on mifchief ; for they faid unto me, make us gods, which fhall
</p>
<p>go before us  and I iaid unto them, whofo hath any gold, let him
</p>
<p>break it off ; fo they give it me and I caft it into the fire, and there
</p>
<p>F
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>came out this calf. Then Mofes called, who is on the Lord's
</p>
<p>fide, and all the fons of Levi gathered themfelves urito him, and
</p>
<p>he faid, " Thus faith the Lord God of Ifrael, put every man his
</p>
<p>fword by his fide, and flay every man his brother, and every man
</p>
<p>his companion, and every man his neighbor  and the children of
</p>
<p>Levi did fo  and there fell of the people that day 3000 men.**
</p>
<p>In like manner, in every age, mankind have been zealous to
</p>
<p>have gods of their own making, and there have always been Aarons
</p>
<p>'at hand to make them golden calves, and the people, at fight of the
</p>
<p>calves, have been ready to build altars, and to fliout, thefe be the
</p>
<p>gods, which lead us.
</p>
<p>Of this temper the leaders of church and ftate have always
</p>
<p>availed, with this difference only, that they have fet themfelves up
</p>
<p>as the gods to ^ad the people, and have taken to their own ufe
</p>
<p>the ear-rings of your wives, your fons and your daughters.
</p>
<p>This idolatrous fpirit in man, is deadly 10 true religion  it hum-
</p>
<p>bles him, and prepares for every fpecies oi fervitudt. If you
</p>
<p>wifh to reduce apy man or number of men to complete flavery, the
</p>
<p>fured mode is jjrfl: to enflave the mind.
</p>
<p>Thefe remarks are not made as new. Church and (late has un-
</p>
<p>derftood all this bufinefscenturies before Robilon's illuminatifts had
</p>
<p>exigence in his brain. The proteflant -world waited no longer
</p>
<p>after the reformation, than Mofes delayed on the mount, in order
</p>
<p>to bring forward their gods to lead the people. We have feen
</p>
<p>with what hafte our anceftors got up their idols. The humble
</p>
<p>minority of profeflbrs confiding of fincere worfhippers, in every
</p>
<p>age have been dillrefled at this abufe of chriftianity : but the ma-
</p>
<p>jority is always impetuous to have gods of their own to lead them,
</p>
<p>and thefe gods have been very tenacious of myfteries. Thus it
</p>
<p>arrives, that if in this or any other country, you look to the major-
</p>
<p>ity of profeffors and to their gods, you look beyond the true religion.
</p>
<p>The body of mankind and their leaders are not employed in a way,
</p>
<p>which juftifies your belief that pure chriftianity is their fuprcme
</p>
<p>object.

<p>As thefe remarks point you drongly to a perception of the New-
</p>
<p>England federal charadter in refped: to religion, fo here they will
</p>
<p>find their application. See a frail mortal, no more thaa man at
</p>
<p>befl-, come forward to the world, without any claims to the illumi-
</p>
<p>nation or powerful ligns of the firft preachers, but inverted with
</p>
<p>forms and appearing in a chara6ter 'variant from the faEl^ aflumed
</p>
<p>under the tacit confent of mankind that fuch chara<::ter is bed for
</p>
<p>impreflion, perhaps a good man, perhaps likely as Aaron to make
</p>
<p>molten images for the people, and to join them in fiiouting, * thefe
</p>
<p>are our gods.* Thus far you have gained no point. He is jull
</p>
<p>fo fit for his place as his future condu<5t Ihall prove him to refem-
</p>
<p>ble his mafter. He cannot heal the fick, but he can he^il divifions,
</p>
<p>he cannot work miracles, but he can go about doing good. If
</p>
<p>to fuch things he is dlfinclined, he is one who is to gather in, not
</p>
<p>the heirs of falvation, but the followers of church and ftate. Not
</p>
<p>content with the rank of a private chriftian, he profefles to have
</p>
<p>been chfen as an ambafTador of truth and divine knowledge, and
</p>
<p>of courfe takes inrtant rank with thofe who give him credence
</p>
<p>above all the ambafTadors of the earth. Certainly profeflions un-
</p>
<p>der fuch ftrong temptations ought to be fcrupuloufly watched.
</p>
<p>Hadnoinrtances occurred, where thefe profeflions both in the pri-
</p>
<p>vate chriftian and public teacher had proved deceitful, lefs caufe
</p>
<p>fhould we have to be on the look-out ; but the fad having often
</p>
<p>happened, fhews that there is no want of charity in confidering it
</p>
<p>pofFible, and often aauai. We are not to wondej that multitudes
</p>
<p>of fuch men yield to the temptation of joining the rich and great,
</p>
<p>and prefer their fociety and patronage to that of the powerleis,
</p>
<p>humble fuccefTors of the firft chrifUans. Thofe men do not hefi-
</p>
<p>tate tc explore your motives of a(51:ion : it is your duty to afcer-
</p>
<p>tain their's. Do they artfully draw religion from the plain, pradi-
</p>
<p>cai ground on which the Saviour placed it ? Do theyfeek a religion
</p>
<p>of myfterious dodrines ? Do they place great (trefs on theories
</p>
<p>and dodrinal points ? They are building from the top ; they have
</p>
<p>laid no foundation. Their followers may fiiout their praifes ; but
</p>
<p>fuch preachers never brought the people out of Egypt, and will
</p>
<p>never conduct them to the promifed land.
</p>
<p>Their firft procefs is to feize on all the myfteries of revelation,
</p>
<p>and thefe furnifh ample fubjeft for their early fermons. They
</p>
<p>delight in attempting to explain thofe very things, into which angels
</p>
<p>will defire forever to look without being able fully to comprehend.
</p>
<p>Let me aflc, has any new light come into our world within feven-
</p>
<p>teen centuries, to iiluftrate myfteries ? Was it intended that men
</p>
<p>ihould know more about them than is revealed ? If fo, who is to
</p>
<p>add to this knowledge ? Is the language of revelation fo defedive
</p>
<p>that it needs fome one to add to it ? If fo, who is the man ? I
</p>
<p>have never conceived that God left his work imperfed and ap-
</p>
<p>pointed any of his imperfea creatures to finifli it. The mode of
</p>
<p>his operating in the natural, is to men myfterious, as his mode of

<p>operating in the fpiritual world : yet we know enough of his
</p>
<p>works for all our purpofes ; we generally difcover their properties
</p>
<p>and ufes. Men furely know that to fpeak with the tongues of an-
</p>
<p>gels  to have the gift of prophecy  to underftand ail myfteries 
</p>
<p>and to have faith, fo as to remove mountains, is nothing without
</p>
<p>the charity and fubftantial morality of the gofpel : yet the preach-
</p>
<p>ing of myfteries is charming, becaufe it plays round the head and
</p>
<p>comes not to the heart ; it raifes the fcience of the hearer without
</p>
<p>Teaching his life : It is exadly adapted to church and ftate pur-
</p>
<p>pofes.

<p>douV.fal theories h to rely on the precife words, in which the fad

</p>
<p>of their exigence is revealed ; yet whatever aflent is gained muft
</p>
<p>depend on the confiftency of the explanation with truths previouf-
</p>
<p>ly within our knowledge : in fa<5t, when a man has known any
</p>
<p>thing with certainty, he can never ceafe to know it, nor believe con-
</p>
<p>trary to it, by the aid of any myfteries whatever. The Catholic
</p>
<p>profefTes and believes that the confecrated wafer ufed in the facra-
</p>
<p>ment is the real body and blood of the Saviour, becaufe the book
</p>
<p>fays fo ; but the proteftant knows that it is not, and all the logic
</p>
<p>and charity in the world will not purfuade him that the Catholic
</p>
<p>believes a v/ord about it. Whenever any thing appears to be in-
</p>
<p>tended in the fcriptures, and yet we knoiv that it does not exift,
</p>
<p>we do better to acknowledge that we do not underftand the import
</p>
<p>ii the book, than to twifl: and turn it to the total facrifice of thofe
</p>
<p>underftandings, which God gave us for rational ufe. Man will
</p>
<p>never be condemned becaufe he does not underftand grammar, or
</p>
<p>becaufe he is unable to feparate thofe fecret things, which belong
</p>
<p>to God, from t|i^fe clearly revealed ones, which belong to him and
</p>
<p>his children. Rito fix hundred fedls has Chriftendom been di-
</p>
<p>vided, becaufe each would obftinately perfift in its own ideas of
</p>
<p>grammar. Churches have been rent afunder becaufe the preacher
</p>
<p>would explain predeftination and free agency; The myfteries
</p>
<p>about whole covenant and half covenant have divided nearly one
</p>
<p>continent, after diftrefling the other for centuries. All the heathen
</p>
<p>world and infants have been fent to eternal perdition, becaufe
</p>
<p>the clergyman could not on any other terms fettle with his gram-
</p>
<p>mar. Heretics have been burnt at the ftake by thoufands, merely
</p>
<p>for difputes about v/ords ; and yet in the midft of all thefe myfte-
</p>
<p>rious obfcurities was (hining in full effulgence the fun of righteouf-
</p>

<p>groaned with the contention, whether there were two or three or-

<p>of theologic points, which if revealed diredlly from heaven would
</p>
<p>not have made one man wifer, nor one hair whiter throughout the
</p>
<p>univerfe. How have difputes about words fevered congregations

<p>in our towns, and Unitarians againft Trinitarians  Calvinifts againft
</p>
<p>Arminians, difputed with the fiercenefs of tygers about the' mind

<p>and will of that being, whofe counfels are in the mighty deep ;
</p>
<p>but who has revealed every thing necellary to man in terms,
</p>
<p>which the moft (imple can underftand. The fcriptures, which
</p>
<p>each fed declares to be perfe<5^1y intelligible, have in the numerous
</p>
<p>feds fix hundred irrefragable proofs that many parts of them are
</p>
<p>hard to be underftood.
</p>
<p>To this fame zeal for grammatical precifion, are we to afcribe
</p>
<p>the jarring ideas and pradices of different churches ou the fubjed
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>of qaalifkations for admiffion ; and the one, which is profefTed
</p>
<p>and relied on by church and (late, is as manifedly variant from the

<p>tongues perform all the fervices of their religion ; but * let your

<p>light fo fhine before men, that others feeing your good works may
</p>
<p>glorify your father in heaven.' When church and ftate unionifts,

<p>thofe dealers in myfteries, profefs that they have new hopes and

<p>refolutions, and whereas they have done wickedly, they will do fo

<p>no more, all the world will wifh them God fpeed j for the world
</p>
<p>is in great want of experienced praditioners in holinefs and mor-

<p>als : but no well founded hopes can be entertained of thefe men.
</p>
<p>Are they preachers of myfteries ? They know no more about them,
</p>
<p>than the humbleft of their hearers. Are they artful civilians ?
</p>
<p>They value myfteries only as they forward their views. Are tkey
</p>
<p>followers of church and ftate ? They may fafely releafe all claim
</p>
<p>to the heirfhip of the kingdom, their portion in the fcriptures is
</p>
<p>found in a narrow compafs  '* If the blind lead the blind, they
</p>
<p>both fall into the ditch."
</p>
<p>It is diftrefling that our world, full enough of unavoidable na-
</p>
<p>tural and moral evil, fhould yet be ten times as full of a fort of
</p>
<p>artificial evil, made up partly of profeflions and denunciations

<p>teach, when every day and fermon prove their power quite human ;

<p>hundred of finding the right path ; and yet each proud adventurer
</p>
<p>is thanking God for the fuperior light of his mind and fed, and
</p>
<p>praying that others may come into the fame. 
</p>
<p>Thofe, who maintain that thefe myfteries are very plain, muft
</p>
<p>render fome new account of the volumes of difputes about them :
</p>
<p>But the fa6t is, every fabbath, fociety and individual, furnifh in-
</p>
<p>conteftible proof, that though the pradical part is plain, the doftrin-
</p>
<p>al part of revelation involves more obfcurities than any other fub-
</p>
<p>}e(5t in the world. All its promifes> connexions and end are ob-
</p>
<p>fcure ; and in view of this fad, which reafon will recognize, but
</p>
<p>which human pride is flow to acknowledge, we ftand aftonifiied at
</p>
<p>the unwavering pofitivenefs with which precifely oppofite dodrine's
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>are maintained from the fame book : but this aftonKhment fhould
</p>
<p>fubfide, when we refle(5l on the proud, gafconading temper of man,
</p>
<p>which leads him to parade and a fliew of fuperior fcience on fub-
</p>
<p>jedls, where the uncertainty of premifes (hields him from an abfo-
</p>
<p>hjte convidtion of fraud or ignorance.
</p>
<p>Obfcure as thefe myfteries are, yet we often hear an ignorant
</p>
<p>duenna, after enquiring the preacher's opinion on predeftination,
</p>
<p>pronounce him right or wrong, as pofitively as if (he knew the
</p>
<p>meaning of the term. And it is not uncommon to hear it re-
</p>
<p>marked of perfons, that they are ignorant on all fubjeds except
</p>
<p>the bible. How happens it that no preacher is fo miferable, but
</p>
<p>that forae will ^ike and praife him, except from the obfcurity of
</p>
<p>the fubjecl ? A^ ignorant man muft of courfe be fupremely ignorant
</p>
<p>on the fubjeft of myftical theology, which as a fcience is, from the
</p>
<p>nature of it as, well as from the artificial obfcurities in which it
</p>
<p>has been involved, the mofl: intricate of all fciences. How hap-
</p>
<p>pens it that clergymen differing wholly in fcntiment can fucceed
</p>
<p>each other as pastors, and yet be equally acceptable, that exchanges
</p>
<p>between fuch can be effected to the mutual fatisfa6tion of their
</p>
<p>refpe(51:ive congregations ? This arifes mofily from the obfcurity of
</p>
<p>the fubjeft ; but partly from 'ears itching for novelty, partly from
</p>
<p>a fort of habitual conception that a pulpit and a preacher are reli-
</p>
<p>gion  that thefe conne<5ied with the ufual exercifes, are a fabbath 
</p>
<p>that a few fabbaths form a fabbatifra, and that by a mechanical at-
</p>
<p>tendance they will obtain a heavenly reft  perhaps as much from a
</p>
<p>perfuafion that any number of men, who have been regularly or-
</p>
<p>dained, mud be right, differ how they may.
</p>
<p>Men never condu(5l thus even in the mofl: trivial of thofe con-
</p>
<p>cerns, which they underftand. Further than this they always con-
</p>
<p>du6t with feme earneftnefs their worldly concerns ; but when this
</p>
<p>religion is the fubje<5l, they appear quite indifferent, and could they
</p>
<p>do this, were they not chilled by cold myfterious dodlrines, inter-
</p>
<p>larded with as cold morals, preceded and followed by cold,
</p>
<p>ftudied formal prayers ? Here is the beginning of the indifference

<p>The body of our people have agreed, that a part of their num-
</p>
<p>ber fhall be better educated than the reft for the exprefs purpofe of
</p>
<p>ferving them better than a common education would admit, and
</p>
<p>for this purpofe have endowed pubhc inftitutions of learning ; in
</p>
<p>confideration of which the privileged fcholar affumes upon himfelf
</p>
<p>to acquire the ufeful learning, which will enable him to render the
</p>
<p>expeded fervice. The clofing of the contract is all which
</p>
<p>the public ever does upon this fubjedl : the parties have feparated
</p>
<p>never to feel again one common intereft, never to meet again on
</p>
<p>equal terms. I fpeak of things as they are. Our northern col-
</p>
<p>leges have been the laboratories of church and ftate. You turn in
</p>
<p>a boy, and out comes a ftatefman, who at his firft leap into our
</p>
<p>world, bounds over the heads of the common people, and fcorning
</p>
<p>the narrow compafs of your rights, ranges among the theories of
</p>
<p>religion, the politics of ancient kingdoms, the balances of
</p>
<p>Europe, and the concerns of this great world, and is very fcien-
</p>
<p>tific on all interefts, except thofe plain ones, to promote and fuftain
</p>
<p>which was the profefTed objea of his education. Were fuch boys
</p>
<p>fent to college to gain ufeful learning  to ftudy the human heart
</p>
<p> to acquire a rational fyftem of morals and the fkill of enforcing
</p>
<p>them  to imbibe refped for the country of their birth and for
</p>
<p>the principles which gave it a national exiftence  to difcover that
</p>
<p>all afcendency over the confciences and opinions of men, which is
</p>
<p>not fairly gained by the force of evidence or reafon, is tyranny ; 
</p>
<p>to fee through the mifts, which proud feftarians have raifed from
</p>
<p>their own paffions, that pure religion, which evidences faith and
</p>
<p>lives inpradice ? Or were they fent there to learn (what ail the
</p>
<p>world's tyrants had before learnt) that the body of mankind have
</p>
<p>a great portion of wealth and rights, that few individuals have
</p>
<p>enough of them to induce their rifquing largely in their defence 
</p>
<p>that men will bear a gradual ufurpation of thefe with patience,
</p>
<p>that fometimes they will endure for one or more centuries the
</p>
<p>total lofs of them, and that thofe, who begin to feize on them in
</p>
<p>the firft ftages of endurance, have the beft chance of fuccefs ?

<p>what may be expeded from them. In tracing the origin of our

<p>prefidents, profefTors and tutors of our colleges  from motives per-

<p>ufurpations. Thefe men are not now thanking you for your early
</p>
<p>care of them, nor cringing for your votes : they have taken the
</p>
<p>ground to which their education pointed them. Not one new dif-
</p>
<p>covery has been made in all this bufinefs ; even the very words,
</p>
<p>with which thefe m^n deceive, have been the appropriate terms of
</p>
<p>deceit through all generations ; yet our young men -come forward

<p>never heard of our revolution. Young men, wooden walls, fedi-

<p>liberty. Thefe were the glorious munitions of the church. Satan

<p>the water, in the perfons of the French :  the whole earth was to

<p>yield its tribute of wealth :  Babylons were to arife in the wil-

<p>cled by thefe arms, apparently extended from motives of affedion,

<p>difcerned not at firft the iron points, which in the embrace were to

<p>fuch adventurers^ain undue advantages, but' a thorough perfuafion
</p>
<p>of their infidioufnefs, and a refolution to repel their trefpaffes on
</p>
<p>the rights of community.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for my fubjeft, the very clafs of men, who mod
</p>
<p>fully exhibit this charafter are the church and ftate unionifts, who
</p>
<p>are fuftained in federal nominations. "" To defend Chriil's king-
</p>
<p>dom, to fecure your property and liberty, federal iav/yers are to be
</p>
<p>iullained, and why ? Is it becaufc they are always on the forlorn
</p>
<p>hope in a war of words, and can gratify the word of your paflions,
</p>
<p>by v/armly efpoufing the worft of your opinions ? Is it becaufe
</p>
<p>they talk loudly of your rights ? Look at the vacant feats of of-
</p>
<p>fice ; for thefe are more in their eyes than your religion and rights.
</p>
<p>What would become of their profeffions, wealth, promotion and
</p>
<p>profpec^s, if religion and equality of rights were to prevail ? It is
</p>
<p>all idle to expect men to conquer nature and ruin themfelves on
</p>
<p>your account. The energies of republicanifm were made on pur-
</p>
<p>pofe to keep fuch men in check.
</p>
<p>In every procefs of my fubjedl, I purpofely draw you to a view
</p>
<p>of the artificial inequalities of fociety, as refulting from nature and
</p>
<p>pafiion, and in further advance under this head, will pohit you to
</p>
<p>the natural courfe, which thefe paflions take to gain their ends.
</p>
<p>Thefe young unionills early difcover that the body of mankind
</p>
<p>refpedt religion, love their families, pr6perty, reputation and peace ;
</p>
<p>and that the nearefl: road to their hearts is by profeffing to refpe<5t

<p>that the body of mankind are not fufpicious and are eafiiy impref-

<p>The apparent fairnefs and fan6tity, which they ufe as arguments
</p>
<p>of their integrity are with me the arguments of their im-

<p>port ure. If they^ are men, and if the courfe which they appa-
</p>
<p>rently take, is their real courfe, it is impoflible for them to mean
</p>
<p>any thing but their own promotion. On this point ambitious
</p>
<p>men, whether called republican or federal are alike by nature ; but
</p>
<p>the lirft believe that the body of mankind ought to be and will be

<p>of mankind mufl: and ought to be fubordinate  they feel as4f all
</p>
<p>things were made for the ufe of the world's mafters. Hence in a
</p>
<p>republic they gain power by profeffing much and doing little : in an
</p>
<p>oligarchy, they profefs lefs and rely more on power T in a monar-
</p>
<p>chy their profeiTions abate, the people know little of their rulers^
</p>
<p>beyond the power, which draws their children into the field and
</p>
<p>the money from their pockets to pay them for being fhot at : Un-
</p>
<p>der a defpotic government the people fink to the condition of
</p>
<p>brutes ; their interefts, feelings and fervices are never thought of,
</p>
<p>the will of one man is law. In a republic the condition of the bo-
</p>
<p>dy of the people is mod: elevated  that o-f rulers leafl: : the paffions
</p>
<p>of thefe lafl propel them to fmk the people in order to raife them-
</p>
<p>felves  and the perfedion of elevation, to which pafiion tends, is
</p>
<p>the total htimUtation of the peopls^ and the total fupremacy of rulers.'
</p>
<p>Following thefe ideas, you will perceive why that miferable
</p>
<p>farce of a weftern infurreftion was aded ; why all our federal
</p>
<p>candidates for ofEce in New-England exclaimed for energy ; why
</p>
<p>France was infulted by a Britifn treaty, and an idle parade of mari-
</p>
<p>time war v/as fet on foot ; why an army was raifed, &c. &c
</p>
<p>All thefe were fo many efforts to drive the people from the true
</p>
<p>ground of moderation and peace. The condition of an extended
</p>
<p>agricultural country like this, required but few laws, and republi-
</p>
<p>canifm always deteils an artificial complication of government : it
</p>
<p>refents falfe alarms of danger as faft as their falfhood is difcovered.
</p>
<p>Next to fuch alarms fucceeded terror and abufe  thefe loft their

<p>contagious afFedions ; at length our federal lawyers, v/ho had

<p>Did oiar members of congrefs, or our council, or our political

<p>join in thefe artifices ? Each one of them pofitively knew that the

<p>country was not in danger of foreign invafion  each one knew

<p>that religion v/as perfectly fafe, and each adive man among them

<p>union of church and ftate ; has always pretended to great zeal for
</p>
<p>the caufe of God and the good of man ; but has always betrayed
</p>
<p>both, and the leaves of hiftory are full of fadls, exhibiting this
</p>
<p>treachery. Pretending to do honor to God and to advance the
</p>
<p>intereQs of their nation, the Jewifh priefts perfecured, and the Jewifii
</p>
<p>rulers crucified the Saviour, amidft the fiiouts of a deluded mul-

<p>titude. Pretending to great zeal for the fame objcdls, the Cath-
</p>
<p>olics offered him up again as a facrifice to human pride, robbed
</p>
<p>his beft friends of their treafure in order to decorate the palaces,
</p>
<p>where they affeded to worfhip him, flaughtered or banifhed his
</p>
<p>moft faithful followers  and eftablifhed a religion of church and
</p>
<p>flate, in which the crucifix and the altar had the fhadow, but the
</p>
<p>felf-ftiied vicar of God on earth enjoyed the fubftance of earthly
</p>
<p>homage. The fame has been true of all the monarchies in Europe.
</p>
<p>The attention can never be arrefted by any fcenes of extenfive
</p>
<p>oppreflion or carnage, without hearing, louder than the cries of the

<p>of benevolence, order and religion. The paffions of man have made
</p>
<p>this an unhappy world, and vice derives its greateft force, not from
</p>
<p>the number of its votaries, but from its capacity of depraving the
</p>
<p>hearts and affociating the interefts of powerful combinations of men.

<p>Were I to prove the depravity of the Jewifti or Romifh fyftems, I

<p>would not do this by ihewing the private charaders of Herod,

<p>of this to former unions  the federal complexion of theunionifts-. 
</p>
<p>and throughout the whole, the portion of violent deftrudlive paf-
</p>
<p>fions, which diftinguifh this union. Previous to fhewing their
</p>
<p>confpiracles againft chriftianity and the government of the United
</p>
<p>States, it was neceftary to render it probable that they would thus
</p>
<p>confpire.
</p>
<p>The great periods of the rife andcheckof that fyftem ofpaffions,
</p>
<p>which is now denominated federalifm, are marked with analogous
</p>
<p>fails. Theearlieft hiftory of man prefents him as fetting up his
</p>
<p>pafHons againft the known law of his Maker  from this moment
</p>
<p>there was a conftant conteft between duty and will  divine precept
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>and human pride ; till at length the paffions gained their crifis and the
</p>
<p>deluge overwhelmed them. After this they gradually gained, en-
</p>
<p>twining themfelves about the moral and ceremonial law, and pervert-
</p>
<p>ing both, till their crifis was difcovered in the total fubjelion of man
</p>
<p>to human inventions, and his total rebellion againlt his Maker.
</p>
<p>The Saviour's advent was alone equal to meet this crifis. He
</p>
<p>convided the prieflrs and rulers of their impoftures, and defeated
</p>
<p>them on their ftrongeft ground : But after his afcenfion, thefe
</p>
<p>pafiions rallied again  feized the very religion which he had foun-
</p>
<p>ded, and in the courfe of fifteen centuries rendered their manage-
</p>
<p>ment of it the greateft of all curfes to mankind. This crifis was
</p>
<p>met by the reformation ; but the feafon had not arrived for the
</p>
<p>Prince of Peace to take up his great power  the paffions rallied
</p>
<p>again their forces, feized the proteftant religion, and in the
</p>
<p>name of it, took pofleffion of the thrones, cabinets and wealth of
</p>
<p>proteftant Europe. Our anceftors met this crifis by the fettlement
</p>
<p>of this country. The paffions, never weary, feized on the Puri-
</p>
<p>tanifm  ^on the religious zeal  on the perfecutions, and even wants
</p>
<p>of our anceftors, and in them eftablifhed a dominion, which met
</p>
<p>its overthrow in our revolution ; and then it was ardently and
</p>
<p>extenfively hoped that rational, civil and religious liberty was to
</p>
<p>prevail : But after the clofe of a moft diftreffing war, thefe fubtle,
</p>
<p>fcdulous paffions feized on the very ardors of the conteft, and even
</p>
<p>on the name of our illuftrious Wafhington, and converted them,
</p>
<p>as they ever before had converted the beft of things to the worfl of
</p>
<p>purpofes. Here the paffions played their deepeft, deadliefl: game 
</p>
<p>they literally played earth in the name of heaven. From the poor
</p>
<p>foldier, who had not, they took away that which he feemed to
</p>
<p>have. To the abundance of the rich they added tenfold from
</p>
<p>the earnings of the diftrefled. To adulterers  to the proud  to
</p>
<p>thofe who defpifed our caufe, they offered honors and power : 
</p>
<p>To the murderers of our brethren by thoufands, they tendered the
</p>

<p>will never forgive him to the end of time.

</p>
<p>To the torrent of paffions which for centuries had been burll-
</p>
<p>ing forth from the exhauftlefs fource of human depravity, he op-
</p>
<p>pofed what the world confidered the feebleft of all barriers, a re-
</p>
<p>ligion, the profefTors of which muft mortify the deeds of the body,
</p>
<p>that their fouls might live. Under every conceivable difadvantage
</p>
<p>in human view he commenced his career.
</p>
<p>In his fermon on the niount, he promulged the laws, which
</p>
<p>were to regulate the fubjecls of his kingdom, and on this occalion
</p>
<p>lb faithfully expofed the impoftures of church and ftate, that the
</p>
<p>Jewifti unionifls v/ere obliged to bring into adtion that deteftable
</p>
<p>charafler, which has uniformly diftinguifhed that clafs of men in
</p>
<p>every age of the world. They regarded his converts as a mifera-
</p>
<p>bie rabble, who followed him for tlie loaves andjifies  abufed them
</p>
<p>for that ignorance and poverty, to which their own oppreffions had
</p>
<p>reduced them, called the Saviour a glutton, a friend of publicans
</p>
<p>and finners, imputed his miraculous gifts to communion with the
</p>
<p>prince of devils^  and becaufe he caft out evil fpirits, they prayed
</p>
<p>him to depart from their coajls. Every fallhood, which the heart
</p>
<p>could conceive or the tongue utter, was ifTued to make him and his
</p>
<p>caufe and followers defpicable. They charged him \y\l\i fedit'wujiy
</p>
<p>inflaming the multitude. In face of all their power and fubtlety
</p>
<p>he preached his religion : They at length rcforted to their laft ef-
</p>
<p>fort, a reign of terror, and after every fpecies of threatning took
</p>
<p>liim by treachery and crucified him.
</p>
<p>That he arofe from the dead, and that the religion which hd
</p>
<p>thus eftabiifiied is chriftianity, are pofitioris, which our unionids
</p>
<p>are pledged not to controvert. It is equally clear that the Saviour
</p>
<p>knew precifely the interefts of his kingdom, and that he had it per-
</p>
<p>fectly in his power to advance it by any means moft conducive to
</p>
<p>thefe interefts ; that he never promifed to his followers offices of
</p>
<p>honor or profit ; never flattered them with ecclefiaftical dignities ;
</p>
<p>never taught them to exped: the favors of men : but afliired them
</p>
<p>that the world would hate them, that through tribulation they muft
</p>
<p>enter the kingdom. He did not tell them, that after his afcenfion,

<p>his kingdom was to depend on popes and cardinals, on kings and
</p>
<p>arch-bilhops, nor on counfellors and dodlors of divinity: but pro-
</p>
<p>mifed that he luould he 'with them to the end of the 'world. He ne-
</p>
<p>ver told them that his church would be in danger of ruin, but af-
</p>
<p>fured them that it was founded on a rock. He never told his dif-
</p>
<p>ciples to carry his religion through the earth by fire and fword,
</p>
<p>nor by tortures and teft afts ; but to combat its enemies with the
</p>
<p>armour of the gofpel : for, fays he, * we fight againft principali-
</p>
<p>ties and powers, and the rulers of the darknefs of this world.'
</p>
<p>The very men, who fince that day have pret,ended to have the
</p>
<p>control of his church were thofe whom he delignated as its moil
</p>
<p>dangerous enemies. The firft great combat againft this infant
</p>
<p>r:hurch wa.s fo unAiccefsful, the paffions fo dreadfully defeated, and
</p>
<p>S9
</p>
<p>the pride of man fo thorowghly humbled, that in later days the en-
</p>
<p>emies of this religion have affumed forms for its overthrow more in-
</p>
<p>fidious than thofe of its firfl: enemies.
</p>
<p>From the nature of this kingdom its policy raufl: always be the
</p>
<p>fame. As it commenced with hoftility to bad paffions, fo it can
</p>
<p>never avail itfelf of them for its fuppprt, and whenever a church
</p>
<p>has repofed itfelf for reft or fafety on the bofom of the ftate, it
</p>
<p>has always fallen to fleep and forgotten its head and hufband. All
</p>
<p>other religions have more or lefs foftered the pride of man ; but
</p>
<p>chriftianity peculiarly oppofes this pride, and claims for itfelf a
</p>
<p>fpirituai exiftence and a total diftin<5tion from the kingdoms of this
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>I have taken the character of this religion, not from volumes
</p>
<p>of commentators ; but from the onlyhiftory of ic, which has any
</p>
<p>claim to authenticity. The king, the laws, adminiftration, ob-
</p>
<p>jefts and end of chriftianity are all fpirituai, and the fjpport of
</p>
<p>this kingdom muft be wholly fpirituai. To this concurrence of
</p>
<p>fadls we muft refer its firft fuccefs, difTufion, and conftant tri-
</p>
<p>umph againft the confpiracies, which have been formed to deftroy
</p>
<p>it, which confpiracies have had the aid of the wealth, power and
</p>
<p>bad paflions of the world. Whole nations have bid it defiance,
</p>
<p>armies have been raifed to fubdue it, cabinets have confpired
</p>
<p>againft it ; yet by the aid of fpirituai weapons it has been * mighty
</p>
<p>in pulling down ftrong holds.' '
</p>
<p>That a confpiracy againft this religion exlfts is an agreed point,
</p>
<p>and the world has been long enough alarmed with fuggeftions that
</p>
<p>republicans in this and other countries were the confpirators.
</p>
<p>That fome of our northern clergy have aftbciated with our federal
</p>
<p>civilians in giving force to thefe fjggeftions-r-that their adlivity has
</p>
<p>been confpicuous at, and previous to our eledlions  that fermons
</p>
<p>and fabbaths have been devoted to this fubjeca  that books for this
</p>
<p>purpofe have been widely circulated, and that the federal cry of
</p>
<p>*' the church is in danger,'* has been raifed to prejudice the repub-

</p>
<p>of election and faft fermons in New-England.
</p>
<p>This union of church and ftate has exifted in New-England
</p>
<p>from its firft fettlement ; but the evidences of its confpiracy againft
</p>
<p>chriftianity were not eonclufive till the year 1797. Previous to
</p>
<p>that time fome civilians had gained promotion through clerical in-
</p>
<p>fluence, the paflions were ilowiy gaining afcendency in the cabinet,
</p>
<p>great antichriftian projeds of national wealth and glory were on
</p>
<p>foot, diplomatic agencies in operation for infalting France accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the law of nations, chriftianity was reprefented by chaplains
</p>
<p>in congrefs, and a new order of things was at hand, which fhould
</p>
<p>give fignificance to ambitious men in church and ftate, and our
</p>
<p>political clergy had begun to learn that civil liberty was the parent
</p>
<p>6o
</p>
<p>of licendoufoefs, and toleration the deftroying angel of church
</p>
<p>difcipline. Mr. Adams was to live but once, and the 'ujell-born
</p>
<p>might never find their places, if it was not done feafonably under
</p>
<p>his adminiftration. In fa6l-, the moment had arrived, when new
</p>
<p>plans prelied rapidly into the minds of our great men ; the idea of
</p>
<p>repofmg on the intelligence of a free people was relinquift-ied by
</p>
<p>our federal leaders, and a fyftem of force, to be operated by cler-
</p>
<p>gy and laity, was decided on. The men a6led as naturally as
</p>
<p>heavy badies do, when they fall to the earth. Monarchy begaa
</p>
<p>to appear more benignant, ariftocracy had powerful charms, the
</p>
<p>names, which ufed to roufe the country to enthufiafm, were def-
</p>
<p>pifed, and the mod: felfifh propenfities of proud hearts were con-
</p>
<p>cealed under the impofing forms of love to religion and zeal for
</p>
<p>order and good government.
</p>
<p>To compafs a revolution in the public mind was a neceflary tafk.
</p>
<p>Various arts were improved ; but among them none fo leading as
</p>
<p>ProfefTor Robifon's proofs of a confpiracy. This Scotch royalift
</p>
<p>had difcovered that a few obfcure inftrudlors in Germany, who
</p>
<p>had nothing on earth to gain but the knowledge of truth and the
</p>
<p>approbation of their employers, were in fal affociated with fome
</p>
<p>new orders of mafons, and that thefe, connefted with deiigning
</p>
<p>men in other parts of the world, were conlpiring to deftroy
</p>
<p>chriftianity^ by ejiahl'ijlnng ajyjiem tf moraL\  The doflrine of all
</p>
<p>this was, that George III. and his minions, and the emperor
</p>
<p>and petty princes of Germany and fome royalift priefts, ^vho had
</p>
<p>always been the public practical enemies of chriftianity, were
</p>
<p>fecretly its friends, and that thefe by joining other great men and
</p>
<p>deftroying this morality might replace chriftianity.
</p>
<p>This miferable mixture of fahliood and folly was greedily feized
</p>
<p>by our unionifts in this country, and inftant pains were taken to
</p>
<p>domefticate and apply the ProfefTor's fafls and doftrine. The
</p>
<p>fads Dr. Morfe found in a great number of. mafonic focieties

<p>all the leading republicans in the country, and to appoint them-
</p>
<p>felves to alTifl: the great men of the world in replacing chriftianity,
</p>
<p>tJnder this order of things Mr. JefFerfon was faid to be the great
</p>
<p>illuminat of this country, and doubtlefs a correfpondent of WiOi-
</p>
<p>aupt. He had declared that the laws of fociety ought not to con-
</p>
<p>troul the confciences of men  therefore he was an atheift ; he
</p>
<p>was attached to the French caufe, therefore loved anarchy and
</p>
<p>approved of all the cruelties reported of that nation : All his
</p>
<p>friends, in approving him, approved every fentiment, which he
</p>
<p>was faid to entertain.
</p>
<p>Thus a humble clafs of men, who enjoyed no'power in fociety,
</p>
<p>and who merely wifhed for the civil and religious liberty, which
</p>
<p>they Had dearly earned, were fuddenly converted into a fet of
</p>
<p>6i
</p>
<p>illumlnatifls, confplrators againft chriftianity, anarchi(ls and infi-
</p>
<p>del philofophers. Barruel, an emigrant papift, heightened this
</p>
<p>triumph of the unionifts by fliewing that the early proteftant
</p>
<p>martyrs were diforganizers, and that infidels and revolutioriifts were
</p>
<p>hand in hand to deftroy chriftianity. This infidel philofophy then
</p>
<p>Ipread its wings and was found to be of monftrous extent. It was
</p>
<p>now difcovered by our political clergy, that all the heathen philo-
</p>
<p>fophers, the deifts of Europe, the illuminatifts, and all the bad
</p>
<p>men of every age ijn the world, and all the republicans here were
</p>
<p>in a league againfl: God, againft morality of every defcription,
</p>
<p>againft divine truth, and that the whole force of federalifm rauft
</p>
<p>be muftered againft fuch a daring combination. Godwin's poUt.
</p>
<p>ical juftice and Volney's ruins, with a number of other books,
</p>
<p>which few republicans had feen, were charged on our caufe. The
</p>
<p>groffeft barbarities, the wiidefl: theories, even the cruelties of
</p>
<p>Robefpieere and the atheifm of Danton were charged on us. New-
</p>
<p>England church and frate now afTumed vifible body andfubftance :
</p>
<p>Federal epifcopalians and difTenters were hand in hand  all federal
</p>
<p>feds loft their diftinftions and difputes, and in conjunftion with
</p>
<p>the old tories of laft war, Britifh merchants, and all who would
</p>
<p>enlift againft the rights of man, cried out, * that the church was
</p>
<p>in danger.'
</p>
<p>This ferment did not fpread promifcuoufly among chriftians
</p>
<p>of all parties, nor was the fever of a religious type ; but that the
</p>
<p>ngents might be like their caufe, the mad bigots of the church
</p>

<p>to the kingdom of the Redeen^er. The fame pride, which coft
</p>
<p>fatan his lofs of heaven, has ere<5led thrones, raifed armies,
</p>
<p>fabricated mitres and cardinals' bonnets, foftered wealth, humbled
</p>
<p>poverty, ennobled the afpiring of this world, and reduced the pure
</p>
<p>in fpirit to all the abufe and degradation, which their Savioui'
</p>
<p>foretold.

<p>62
</p>
<p>Chrlftlanity is not parading our world in uniforms and epaulets,
</p>
<p>nor dancing attendance in (late rooms, nor rolling in chariots,
</p>
<p>nor fluttering in lace, nor faring fumptuoufly every day. It bears
</p>
<p>the fame meek charafber, which it always did ; and the Saviour
</p>
<p>delights now as formerly to dwell with the humble and contrite.
</p>
<p>The parable of Dives and Lazarus has raifed up more confpira-
</p>
<p>tors again ft chriftianity than all the deillical writings. Had we
</p>
<p>been told that the rich man, after drefiing in fcarlet and fine linen,
</p>
<p>was tranflated to eternal wealth and fplendor, and that the poor
</p>
<p>man was fent into torments, church and ftate would have been
</p>
<p>charmed with the event ; but for the parching tongue of Dives,
</p>
<p>the pointed reproof of Abraham, and the exaltation of Lazarus,
</p>
<p>they hate the parable.
</p>
<p>To have both worlds in a row, has been the fteady exertion
</p>
<p>of all the confpirators againft chriftianity : hence they have
</p>
<p>placed the higheft honors in this world as the middle ground
</p>
<p>between humility and heaven, and have found it an eafy taflc to
</p>
<p>promote from an earthly to a celeftiai crown, while their greatefl:
</p>
<p>powers could never elevate the tenants of cottages above the
</p>
<p>poverty and diftrefs, into which the oppreflion of their heaven
</p>
<p>bound lords had funk them.
</p>
<p>How tranfporting to human pride to be drefTed in magnificent
</p>
<p>robes  to be adored by the pobulace  to be received as an ambaf-
</p>
<p>fador of heaven  to be called high prieft, vicar of God, holy
</p>
<p>father, arch-bifhop, or doftor of divinity, and after a fulnefs of
</p>
<p>earthly homage to be tranflated to the rank of priefts unto God
</p>
<p>forever !  How gratifying to be called a king, duke, governor,
</p>
<p>counfellor, or member of congrefs, and then to be promoted to the
</p>
<p>higheft honors in another world for defending the faith !  How
</p>
<p>charming to the rich man to be adding thoufands to thoufands, and
</p>
<p>to calculate that after an independent eftate here he will be a ricli
</p>
<p>capitalift in a world of filver, gold, precious ftones and pearls ! 
</p>
<p>A heaven, where every human paflion is glorified, is the heaven of

<p>profeflions or forms of devotion, they cannot love a religion,
</p>
<p>which came to redeem the oppreffed, to raife the poor from the
</p>
<p>duft, to bring down every lofty thought, .and to humble human
</p>
<p>pride, that no flefh might glory in the prefence of God.
</p>
<p>' When we know that a confpiracy againft chriftianity exifts, we
</p>
<p>(hould feek for the authors of it among thofe, who are certainly
</p>
<p>hoftile to it. In this country we fhall find this hoftility in one of
</p>
<p>the great political parties. The particular point of time, when
</p>
<p>the alarm of * the church is in danger* was founded will be im-
</p>
<p>portant to the difcufiion. It was under the admiuiftration of Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams. The paflion for power and wealth had fuffered a painful
</p>
<p>interregnum during our revolution. Some men of obfcure origin
</p>
<p>had held high rank in our army, multitudes had by a feren years
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>fervice, earned a commutation : Some ardent patriots had gained
</p>
<p>the afre<5tions of the country : The paffions fufFered a tedious delay
</p>
<p>of five years, and met fevere checks in the con<?ention. Multi-
</p>
<p>tudes were anxious to fee a great ftock of power laid up for the
</p>
<p>future lords of this country. A man, more to be honored by a
</p>
<p>grateful recolle(5tion of his fervices than by maufoleums and ftatues,
</p>
<p>was placed at the head of our government. Some men, who
</p>
<p>mortally hated republicanifm, held high rank under him : They
</p>
<p>wifhed ardently for the old order of things. The pafiion for
</p>
<p>wealth gained a momentary triumph in that paper fyftem, which
</p>
<p>robbed our foldiers of the certificates of their merit, and created
</p>
<p>a fet of tools for the future operations of federalifm. The paflion
</p>
<p>for military glory juft breathed in the weftern infurredion : All
</p>
<p>the paflions began to live in the Britifh treaty ; but the Id order
</p>
<p>of things was not yet eftabliflied. Mr. Adams, who fucceeded to
</p>
<p>the prefidency, had learnt in Europe the whole fyftem of balances
</p>
<p>and the correct policy of retaining the liberties of a people by
</p>
<p>lodgiag them as a depofit in the hands of their 'well-born rulers.
</p>
<p>It was in the midft of his adminiftration, in a full tide of mod
</p>
<p>fuccefsful experiments on the worft of theories, in the midft of
</p>
<p>every anti-chriftian project that this charge of infidel confpiracy
</p>
<p>Was raifed againft the republicans. It was in the midft of a mari-
</p>
<p>time war againft our former ally, which war we had courfed
</p>
<p>through all the forms of diplomatic duplicity ; while we were in
</p>
<p>fa6t raifing an army and navy and feeking employ for them, as the
</p>
<p>hungry man does for a day's work  and while the walls of our
</p>
<p>fenate refounded 'extermination to men, women and children'
</p>
<p>It was in the midft of a fedition adl, incarcerating men who had
</p>
<p>the franknefs to charge the adminiftration with deviating from the
</p>
<p>avowed principles of our revolution  It was in the midft of an
</p>
<p>ahen aft, driving from our lliores the ftranger, whom we had in-
</p>
<p>vited  It was, when our k'nds were taxed to fuftain the bufmefs
</p>
<p>of war and the confequent deftruftion of economy and morals 
</p>
<p>It was when every paffion had gained dominion in the cabinet, this

</p>
<p>charge of infidel confpiracy was brought forward, and at this mo-
</p>
<p>ment Mr. Adams and his party were making as decided war againft
</p>
<p>chriftianity, as if they had raifed an army for its exprefs deftruc-
</p>
<p>tion. How indignant muft he have been, at his levee, in the
</p>
<p>midft of his generals, commodores and courtiers, and of great
</p>
<p>plans of carnage and national glory, to hear religion crying to him,
</p>
<p>" Wafh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings
</p>
<p>from before mine eyes, ceafe to do evil, learn to do well, relieve
</p>
<p>the oppreftd, judge the fatherlefs, plead for the widow." The
</p>
<p>man, who fliould have preached fuch dodjines, v/ould have been
</p>
<p>puniihed under his fedition a<5l : for the whole is a reproof of his
</p>
<p>adminiftration. Mr. Adams was Vvrilling to avail himfelf of the
</p>
<p>church and ftate religioqof the day j but ali his meafures conffir-
</p>
<p>f</againftthe gofpel of peace and reconciliation. There was an
</p>
<p>appearance of religion in the appointment of a national faft day ;
</p>
<p>but this was very appropriately devoted, in feveral inftances, to the
</p>
<p>praifes of adrainiftration, to the proftitution of the defli, and to
</p>
<p>the abafement of republicans.
</p>
<p>While we have bibles in our hands, are we to be told that indi-
</p>
<p>Tiduals are to live in the exercife of all the chriftian graces ; but
</p>
<p>that nations are abfolved from thefe duties  that nations may
</p>
<p>cultivate hatred and revenge, and devour each other-* that nations
</p>
<p>may idolize wealth and encourage luxury and pride ? Are we to
</p>
<p>be told that the court of Mr. Adams, where every paflion was at
</p>
<p>home (as much as at St. James') was a chriftian court, and that
</p>
<p>perfect refpedl for the kingdom of the Redeemer influenced his
</p>
<p>cabinet, while they were copying all the parade, profufion and
</p>
<p>military rage of earthly kingdoms ? The tendency of meaf-
</p>
<p>ures in thofe days (hews the extreme hoftility of our federal lead-
</p>
<p>ers agaitift chriftianity. They could not open a page in the New-
</p>
<p>Teftament without finding a fevere reprimand. To conceal their
</p>
<p>leal and adive enmity againft chriftianity they raifed a miferable
</p>
<p>charge of confpiracy againft republicans.
</p>
<p>Let us now fee how our northern unionifts were conducing.
</p>
<p>They were approving all the meafures of adminiftration, and juftify-
</p>
<p>ing every deviation from divine precepts under the neceflity of the
</p>
<p>cafe. If the Algerines difturbed our Mediteranean trade ;. if the
</p>
<p>French refufed the ragged remnant of favors, which the Britifli
</p>
<p>treaty permitted us to offer ; if the natives of the wijdernefs did
</p>
<p>not agree with us on boundary lines, it was federally right for Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams to fay, * Vengeance is mine and I will repay.' Our uni-
</p>
<p>onifts very cheerfully took the bleflednefs promifed to the meek,
</p>
<p>to the pure in heart, to the merciful and to peace makers, and be-
</p>
<p>ftowed it on Mr. Adams, Mr. Pinckney, General Hamilton,
</p>
<p>and the officers of the new army and navy : For thefe men pray-
</p>
<p>ers afcended from the hearts of our unionifts, and while national
</p>
<p>glory and wealth were in their view, far out of fight were the
</p>
<p>dodri.ies and morals of that religion, which teaches univerfal be-

</p>
<p>nevolence, humility and a contempt- for the applaufes of men, the
</p>
<p>pride of nations and the fplendors of life.
</p>
<p>The unionifts may' plead that the ftate of the world was greatly
</p>
<p>altered and that the charader" of chriftianity muft conform to
</p>
<p>the temper of the times. I am aware that when men feize
</p>
<p>chriftianity into their own hands, they will thus conform it
</p>
<p>and the gofpel will be made to fandtion every projedt of ambi-
</p>
<p>tion ; but if I underftand the nature of this religion; every thing
</p>
<p>on earth muft bend to it. Every profefixr of it, whether preach-
</p>
<p>er or hearer, muft feel humble enough to wafti the feet of the
</p>
<p>pooreft difciple. Every profefTor muft be ready to lay his honors
</p>
<p>at the feet of the crofs^ and muft be willing to fsll all which h
</p>
<p>has and give to the poor, that he may have treafure in heaven.
</p>
<p>He mud: regard this world as drofs and vanity, mud- combat all
</p>
<p>his lufts, and mufl: cultivate a prevailing affection for t'ae Father
</p>
<p>of fpirits and every member of his family.
</p>
<p>How Hiufl proud prelates and ambitious iflatefmen abhor fuch a
</p>
<p>religion : every faculty of their fouls, and every imagination of
</p>
<p>their hearts rife up in rebellion again ft it. Surely at a feafon,
</p>
<p>when our general government had juft taken rank among the
</p>
<p>principalities, againft which the Saviour had warned his church ;
</p>
<p>at a feafon, when our unionifts were advocating and praying for
</p>
<p>fyftems of debt, of war, v/ealth and expence, it will be natural
</p>
<p>to believe that they were fubftantially confpiring againft a religion,
</p>
<p>which can never be defeated by a world of open enemies ; but
</p>
<p>may be faffered to languifh from wounds received in the houfes
</p>
<p>of its pretended friends.
</p>
<p>At a feafon, when all the friends of Zion ought to have been
</p>
<p>alarmed at the progrefs, in this new world, of a kingdom oppo-
</p>
<p>fed to that of the Redeemer, the unionifts cried aloud and fpared
</p>
<p>rot to exclaim, that the republicans were confpirators againft
</p>
<p>chriftianity. My proof of this is in a narrow compafs. Doctor
</p>
<p>Dwight's two fermons on the nature and danger of infidel philofo-
</p>
<p>phy were delivered to the candidates for the baccalaureate in
</p>
<p>September 1797. In the compafs of 95 pages he recites the
</p>
<p>ftrongcft and moft contradictory propofitions in nature as having
</p>
<p>been maintained by the heathen philofophers and modern infidels,
</p>
<p>whofe lives, according to him, were correfpo: r^.i^. y/ku che moft
</p>
<p>abominable principles. He ftates this phiioiophy to be then
</p>
<p>prevalent in Europe and to have reached this country. He does
</p>
<p>not explicitly charge this pjhilofophy on Mr. Jefferfon and the \epub-
</p>
<p>licans of this country : but they were exprefsly aliucd at, as
</p>
<p>appears by the following facts. In a note at the clofe of the fer-
</p>
<p>mons he fays, fpeaking of Robifon's proofs of a confpiracy, " la
</p>
<p>" this work the reader may fee the dangers of infidel philofophy

<p>" be done under the pretence of enlarged philofophy, and of giv-
</p>
<p>** ing mankind liberty and equality.'*^ The attempts of Dr.
</p>
<p>Dwight, Dr. Morfe, and a great number of other federal clergy-
</p>
<p>men to fix the charader of this infidel philofophy on Mr. Jefferfon,
</p>
<p>and as njuch of it on his friends as they could feverally bear, have
</p>
<p>been made public. The Palladium and other papers of the union-
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>iils have given a political charader to thefe charges, and v/e will
</p>
<p>bear them patiently, if it fhall appear on a fair examination that
</p>
<p>we deferve them.
</p>
<p>We might reft our defence on the improbability of fuch a
</p>
<p>felf deftroying confpiracy ; but as my objed is to fix on the
</p>
<p>unionifts a charge of confpiracy, perfedly comporting with
</p>
<p>their characters, I fhall devote the next number to a confideration
</p>
<p>of thefe charges.

<p>BO. Ill

</p>
<p>charges agaitijl us with curs agamjl them.
</p>
<p>w
</p>
<p>E charge the unionifts with confpiring, not again ft
</p>
<p>the name, form and profefTion, but againft the fpirit and temper
</p>
<p>of chriftianity. We conform this charge to nature and impute
</p>
<p>it to that fyftem of pafEons, which has always been hoftile to
</p>
<p>chriftianity. We find abundant precedents of fuch a confpiracy
</p>
<p>in every age of the church, managed by high priefls and infidel
</p>
<p>ftatefmen, under the influence of fimilar temptations. We reft
</p>
<p>this cliarge on the diftindlion betv/een the kingdom of the Saviour
</p>
<p>and the principalities of this world. We trace this charge
</p>
<p>through ti^.e wealth and honors by which our unionifts are fur-
</p>
<p>rounded, and find them exaitly in the place, where confpirators
</p>
<p>might naturally be expeded.
</p>
<p>Their charge againft us is exprefTed in the note above quoted.
</p>
<p>Under the pretence of enlarged philanthropy, and giving to man-
</p>
<p>kind I'iherty and equality, we have been faid to bid defiance to
</p>
<p>nature, reafon and truth, to have declared war on ouifelves, to
</p>
<p>aim at the deftrudion of all thof e fyftems, which protc6l our lives
</p>
<p>and properties. We have been faid to difclaim the being of a

<p>God and of moral obligations  and all this knowingly, and with
</p>
<p>afet defign to introduce univerlal ^rz//i/m /

</p>
<p>the caufe fo far as refpeds the charge againft us ; but I ftiall im-
</p>
<p>prove the faft of this charge as an argument of the confpiracy of
</p>
<p>the unionifts.
</p>
<p>Though trials in the fire make the faints everlaftingly 'rich, yet
</p>
<p>it was natural for thofe of that clafs in this country to hope that
</p>
<p>after the con-ulfions in Europe, by reafon of the confpiracies o^.
</p>
<p>6?
</p>
<p>kings agalnft chriflldnity, the leaders of this new world wouI4
</p>
<p>have endeavored to conform their policy, to that of the Saviour's
</p>
<p>kingdom, and that (fo far as the wifdom of man could contrive)
</p>
<p>wars fhould ceafe, and a fpirit of juftice, toleration and benevo.
</p>
<p>lence ihould prevail : But our high priefls and federal rulers had
</p>
<p>far different projeds in view. My mind prefents not a fhade of
</p>
<p>difference between the condition of all other countries and this
</p>
<p>in refpedl to the fubjed before us. Look back on the whole period
</p>
<p>of time from the days of the apoflles to this day, and through
</p>
<p>all the kingdoms within the boundaries of chrifHanity, and mark
</p>
<p>(it you can) the time and place, when and where the faints were
</p>
<p>holding the command of this world, and the proud and afpiring,
</p>
<p>were out of place. No fuch occafion prefents itfelf : but the true
</p>
<p>fubjeds of the Redeemer's kingdom were found in the humbleft
</p>
<p>walks of life, and the dodrlnes of their Saviour were buffeted and
</p>
<p>perfecuted by the powers of church and ftate. From fuch a view
</p>
<p>can you inftantly cafl: your eyes on your own country and believe
</p>
<p>that the whole nature of man and the whole character of chriffiani-
</p>
<p>ty have changed, and that a levee of courtiers, contriving to fend
</p>
<p>our conimerce through the globe, to extend our territory to the
</p>
<p>Miffifippi, to make this the greateft, mod warlike and powerful
</p>
<p>nation on earth, and planning death and defolation for all, who
</p>
<p>fhould oppofe their projefls, were in fli6t feumble fubjefls of the
</p>
<p>king of Zion, and that a number of powerlefs men, whofe rights
</p>
<p>were all gone, and whofe only remnant of this world was the
</p>
<p>profpeft of a better, were confpiring againfl chriflianity, under
</p>
<p>the guife of liberty and equality ?
</p>
<p>I might rifque the decifion of this queftion on its natural im-
</p>
<p>preflions ; but it is rational to afk, what could republicans exped:
</p>
<p>from the deftrudlion of that religion, which they were faid to
</p>
<p>confpire againfl ? The worfl of infidels have fought bravely for
</p>
<p>their homes, their property, and their children : but the bleffed

<p>infidel philofophers, was to be the certain lofs of their homes,
</p>
<p>their property and their children- the diflblution of thofe very
</p>
<p>focieties, a bnrfting of all human bands, an efcape from the govern-

<p>ly hoftile to chrifiiianity, yet they were faid to confpire againft this
</p>
<p>religion in "order to deflroy thefe nieafures ! After tke political

<p>prelates had wrought up thefe charges to fuch a pitch of extrava-
</p>
<p>gance, that each charge deflroyed itfelf, the infidel civilians dif-
</p>
<p>covered * that liberty and equality,' the animating themes of our

<p>revolution, meant licentioufnefs and anarchy  that oppofitiott to-

</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>ameliorate the condition of man was comparable with the manu-
</p>
<p>fadure of marble pin-cii(hions.*'
</p>
<p>The extravagance of thefe charges was perfcftly in character
</p>
<p>for thefe unionil-ls. Confpirators naturally charge with great force
</p>
<p>their own projefls on others, in order to elude fufpicion and
</p>
<p>vigilance ; but thefe charges were not more daring than the fafts
</p>
<p>and meafures, which they were intended to conceal. Thefe
</p>
<p>fads were found among the kingdoms of the world, whofe lead-
</p>
<p>ers, juft like ours, were purfuing plans of national and perfonal
</p>
<p>glory, inconfiftent with freedom and chriftianity. The meafures
</p>
<p>werejufi: like the meafures of thofe kingdoms. It was necefTary
</p>
<p>to proftrate the public mind, and fuch a charge of infidel confpira-
</p>
<p>cy on the republicans could alone effect this proftration. Political
</p>
<p>clergy aided thefe charges ; they preached from Robifon and Barruel
</p>
<p> fome ranked them next to the bible  the people believed, becaufe
</p>
<p>they had been in the habit of believing in fuch men : Infidel
</p>
<p>civilians refounded thefe charges  republicans were perfonally
</p>
<p>infuited with them  fermons againft infidelity furnifhed a feaft of

<p>fat things to federal zealots, and the memorable reign of terror

<p>was a feafon of triumph to the bafeft paflions, which ever con-
</p>
<p>fpired againft chriflianity.
</p>
<p>The Jews charged the Saviour with confpiring againft the true
</p>
<p>religion. The Catholics charged the proteftants, and the church
</p>
<p>of England charged the Purit;^ns, in the fame manner ; yet in
</p>
<p>every inftance the accufed were out of power, and had nothing to
</p>
<p>expe(5t but lolTes and perfecution, and in every inftance the occu-
</p>
<p>fers were the real confpirators, and the mod fecular confiderations
</p>
<p>manifellly impelled them to their charges. In the prefent cafe the

<p>unionlfts had all the power in their hands, chriftianity was frown-

<p>W:
</p>
<p>E have not charged the unlonifts with confpiring
</p>
<p>againft themfelves, their wives, children, property, reputation
</p>
<p>and peace : we have not charged them with all the depravity of
</p>
<p>all ages and nations ; we have not called them by every hateful
</p>
<p>name nor imputed to them every crime : but have coolly charged
</p>
<p>them with confpiring againft chriftianity, precifely as other men,
</p>
<p>great, wife and holy as themfelves, have done under fimilar tempt-
</p>
<p>ations.
</p>
<p>The extent of this confpiracy is two-fold, firft, as refpeds the
</p>
<p>men who confplre, and fecond, as refpe6ts the religion againft which
</p>
<p>they confpire. The firft of thefe heads will occupy the prefent
</p>
<p>number.
</p>
<p>As nature and paflion have raifed this confpiracy for feliifh and
</p>
<p>worldly purpofes, fo they have always direfted its courfe. The
</p>
<p>body of the Jews had been fo deluded by their leaders that they
</p>
<p>were unwilling to embrace chriftianity. Their fteady habits were
</p>
<p>juft as dear to them as ours are to us. Their great men, who pro-
</p>
<p>fefted to be friends of order and good government, appeared to
</p>
<p>them as honeft as our great men appear : Their high priefts appear-
</p>
<p>ed as devout and pious as ours do : yet with all thefe impreffions
</p>
<p>they did not confpire againft chriftianity ; but it was the chief
</p>
<p>priefts and rulers, who took counfel together how they might flay
</p>
<p>the Saviour. The people were ready enough to obey their rulers
</p>
<p>and to exprefs their fenfelefs joy that the king of the Jews was fuf-
</p>
<p>pended between two malefactors : they were ready to ofter him
</p>
<p>vinegar and gall, to place a crown of thorn5 on his head and to
</p>
<p>pierce his fide ; and they really believed that in all this they were
</p>
<p>honouring God and the religion of their fathers. Can it be necef-
</p>
<p>fary to add that the great men, who had fecured this blind confi-
</p>

<p>race? They had retained moft of the forms of religion, valued
</p>
<p>themfelves highly on obfervance of the ceremonial law, and had
</p>
<p>kept clean the outfide of the cup and the platter.
</p>
<p>The Catholics had been fo deluded by their leaders, that they
</p>
<p>joined them readily in the work of perfecution : but the denounc-
</p>
<p>ing of the victims and the confpiracies againft pure chriftianity
</p>
<p>were managed by kings, popes, and their conclaves. It is not
</p>
<p>among the body of the peonle in other nations, or our own, that
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>we are to feek for confplrators again ft chriftAnity. We do not
</p>
<p>charge the majority of our people with this confpiracy. They
</p>
<p>doubtlefs wifli for the prevalence of chriftianity, if not in every
</p>
<p>cafe from motives of perfonal afFeflion for the caufe ; yet from a
</p>
<p>perfjafion that it is beft for mankind, and they really believe that
</p>
<p>they are promoting it by advocating andfuftaining federal men and
</p>
<p>meafures. Multitudes of federalifts, who voted uniformly in
</p>
<p>favor of the laft adminifkatiospi and againft the prefent, were
</p>
<p>honed in their intentions and difcovered no want of piety : No
</p>
<p>man is a knave merely becaufe he is deceived. Even the man,
</p>
<p>who was atory through the laft war (becaufe he really believed in
</p>
<p>the juftice and policy of a regal government) and who fuftained
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams* adminiftration, becaufe it tended to monarchy^ was an
</p>
<p>honeft man. He ought to have been pleafed with a fedition and
</p>
<p>alien a6t and with a (landing army : for royalty can never be again
</p>
<p>fuftained in our world without a correfpondent dominion of force.
</p>
<p>All our tories in New-England are on the federal fide, and fome
</p>
<p>of them are honeft enough to avow their motives.
</p>
<p>The merchant, who really believed thac the pafl: admlni/lration
</p>
<p>would advance the intereft of commerce (confiftently with the
</p>
<p>other interefts and duties of fociety) more than the prefent, was
</p>
<p>honeft in fuftaining Mr. Adams' adminiftration ; but if he pre-
</p>
<p>tended that chriftianity v/as ferved by the fhedding of blood for
</p>
<p>theobjeftof gain, he may take rank among the confpirators.
</p>
<p>It was perfectly natural for the farmer to wiih to gain a high
</p>
<p>price for his produce: (no clafs of men is fo miferably paid in
</p>
<p>proportion to their labor) but if the farmer pretended that chrif-
</p>
<p>tianity and the war-meafures of Mr. Adams, were connected, he
</p>
<p>alfo may take rank among the confpirators : the go/pel never enlifted

<p>confufion, would naturally have been alarmed, and when his pow-
</p>
<p>erful brethren, who kneiv all this to be political fraud, told him.
</p>
<p>that it was all true, it was natural for him to pray again ft fucli
</p>
<p>men, to preach againft them, to attend proxies and to ftimulate
</p>
<p>his people to vote againft them, and even to read forged letters
</p>
<p>from his deflc, if he believed them to be genuine ;  yes it was
</p>
<p>natural ^01 him to improve every text of fcripture, and every occa-
</p>
<p>fion of grace, and every portion of perfonal influence to poHtical
</p>
<p>purpofes, and to aftbciate with gi^t civilians, who approved his

<p>wanderings  but fuch natures ought to have been under the influ-

</p>

<p>wherever you find, in New-England, a clergyman, whofe chofen

<p>fociety is among infidel civilians, and whofe greateft delight has
</p>
<p>been to fpread the alarm of infidel philofophy againft the republic-
</p>
<p>ans, he is a confpirator againft chriftianity ; the New-Teftament
</p>
<p>is full of reproofs for him, and there is a loud call to him to
</p>
<p>repent and believe the gofpel. f
</p>
<p>Republicans have never been oppofed to the pious and faithful
</p>
<p>of the clergy : fuch men will always do all the good in their pow-

<p>er, and will never fow the feeds of ftrife and debate. Holinefs,
</p>
<p>juftice, truth, mercy, charity and humble faith never expofed one
</p>
<p>man to ridicule and abufe in New-England ; but every pafs which
</p>
<p>has been made at hypocrify and double-dealing, has been artfully
</p>
<p>parried by pretences that all religion, all piety and goodnefs, are
</p>
<p>aimed at. If men will not make obvious diftin6lions, it is not our
</p>
<p>fault. We profefs that we have as much natural affection as others,
</p>
<p>that we cannot live without government  and that whatever be
</p>
<p>our own lives, we wifli that all the reft of fociety would condud
</p>
<p>according to the golden rule of morality. We profefs to wilh that
</p>
<p>our enemies as well as our friends might have no law to bind their
</p>
<p>confciences but the law of God, and we profefs to be unwilling to
</p>
<p>lofe any of our rights through fraud, falfehood or hypocnfy,
</p>
<p>or through any artful combination of chrijltanity ivlth the kingdoms of
</p>
<p>this world. We claim that thofe, who ferve at the altar, ftiould
</p>
<p>mind the things of the altar, and that thofe of our fellow-men,
</p>
<p>who claim to have the high calling, to have a divine miflion or to

<p>Every thing in nature confpires to prove that we muft be fincere

<p>wc are enemies to ourff Ives knowingly and with defign  and that
</p>
<p>without any pofTible motive we are confpiring againft our own in-

<p>that they are not, and claiming that we are not what we profefs to

</p>
<p>Let the body of federalifts in New England reflect and decide
</p>
<p>whether it can be for the intereft of our caufe to charge them indif-
</p>
<p>criminately with confpiring againft chriftianity ? certainly we have
</p>
<p>no precedent of fuch a cafe. The body of mankind may be delu-
</p>
<p>ded ; they are never fyftematically difhoneft : leaders have mo-
</p>
<p>tives, which cannot be extended to the multitude.  Let the
</p>
<p>parifh clergy, whofe prevailing attention has been to the church
</p>
<p>and its caufe, decide whether we can gain by reflecting on them,
</p>
<p>or whether one article of our creed will prejudice them in their
</p>
<p>labors  v/hether their people will be worfe or better for profelling as
</p>
<p>we do. Surely if the high prlefts and rulers wi(h to be in political
</p>
<p>(torms, thefe humble fhepherds will do beft to feed the iambs of
</p>
<p>their flocks in green paflures, and to water them at the well of fal-
</p>
<p>vation.- Wicked and infidel as may be fome republicans,
</p>
<p>yet even thefe will rejoice, if through the labors of fuch men, the
</p>
<p>bad paifions of the day may be abated, and we may have fome
</p>
<p>foretafte of the new heavens and new earth, in which dwelleth

<p>righteoufnefs.
</p>
<p>Will the political clergy and the politicians aflbclated with them,

<p>a(k us whether they are the fubjeds of this difcuflion ? We an-

<p>At this point my fubje<5l prefents all its refponfibilities. In

<p>every advance I have been obliged to meet and difpofe of preju-

<p>dices. Here a great portion of them is embodied. The fervility

<p>of the human character, increafed by fuccellive abafements through

<p>all the periods of time,  perfonal partialities  and the apprehen-

<p>aifefled to guard it ; yet according to their own account the con-
</p>
<p>dition of it has always been growing worfe, religion has been
</p>
<p>declining, and the mournful cry of Mr. Adams *' On evil times
</p>
<p>indeed are we fallen," was a fit commentary on his admmiftration.
</p>
<p>If mankind do not care for their religion, then it is well enough
</p>
<p>to let fu^cefiive generations of great men play their pantomnnes
</p>
<p>over it, in aid of all their political meafures. If chriftianity
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>has ceafed to combat the paffions, and has enlifted on their fnU^
</p>
<p>then it ought to wait on the titled and wealthy ; it ought to be
</p>
<p>fent on fhipboard or into the army ; it ought to be the tool of
</p>
<p>every impoftor : but to every real chriftian, who has attached
</p>
<p>himfeJf to great men and great plans, the fpirit of the gofpel is
</p>
<p>crying, * Come out from among them and be ye feparated, faith
</p>
<p>the Lord of hofts.'
</p>
<p>If it has not been learnt by the experience of feventeen centu*
</p>
<p>ries that great men have great paffions, which lead to great anti-
</p>
<p>chriftian meafures, and that real piety never had a fenfible exigence,
</p>
<p>but in the hearts and lives of the humble and contrite, probably
</p>
<p>that of feventy will be infufHcient. Men may pretend that this
</p>
<p>or that high prieft is very important to the chriftian caufe, and
</p>
<p>may eftablilli newfpapers to fupport it, and may vote that the
</p>
<p>governor and council and houfe of reprefentatives in general
</p>
<p>court afTembled (hall have the charge of it ; yet the king of Zion
</p>
<p>will continue to reign in the greatnefs of his ftrength, and will
</p>
<p>punifh all attempts to ufarp his dominion^
</p>
<p>Suppofe that our legiflature fliould repeal the laws, which affed
</p>
<p>to fupport chriftianity, and fhould grant that part of the baptifts*
</p>
<p>petition (which they were careful not to anfwer) in which they
</p>
<p>prayed that the church might be left to the guidance of its Head 5
</p>
<p>fuppofe that mankind were left to profefs and worfhip according to
</p>
<p>the diftates of their confciences, would chriftianity lofe ground ?
</p>
<p>Suppofe that the judges of our fuperior court (Meffrs. Root,
</p>
<p>Sturges, Mitchel, Ingerfoll and Ree've) after accepting the ap-
</p>
<p>pointment of electors of Prefident and Vice Prefident, and after
</p>
<p>voting for Charles Cotefworth Pinckney (who is net a pious chrif-

<p>tian) had decided that political integrity and talents fhould be the
</p>
<p>qualifications of a chief' magiftrate, and that religion and civil
</p>
<p>government were diftind in their natures, means and end, would
</p>

<p>of religion, and that they were about to vote for Gen. Pinckney,
</p>
<p>how confident would it have been to declare that chriflianity had

</p>
<p>according to their cofifciences, they did well, but church and (late
</p>
<p>underflands all the fubtleties of operation !
</p>
<p>If Mr. Tracy and Mr. Talmadge (hould quit the church in
</p>
<p>Litchfield and declare that in future they would not run tiie
</p>
<p>chriftian race : If the Rev. Mr. Backus and the Rev. Mr. Hunt-
</p>
<p>ington fhould refolve that after they had ruined the charafters of
</p>
<p>the Rev. Mr. Grifwold and Mr. Kirby, they would quit the pro-
</p>
<p>feffion of preaching : If all the political clergy fhould refolve that
</p>
<p>after the preaching down the republicans of their charge they
</p>
<p>would quit their dell<s : If the prefidents of our colleges, and
</p>
<p>the profeffors and tutors fhould declare that they would never
</p>
<p>again exert themfelves to advance chrilllanity : If Gov. Strong,
</p>
<p>Gov. Gilman and Gov. Trumbull, with their lieutenants and
</p>
<p>their federal counfellors and affemblymen fhould declare that they
</p>
<p>would never more rely on clerical influence, and would never aid
</p>
<p>the chriftian caufe, let me all<, would the religion of New-England
</p>
<p>fuffer ? If it woujd, then decidedly it is not the religion of the
</p>
<p>New-Teflament.
</p>
<p>Were all thefe men to declare open war againft chriilianity, its
</p>
<p>king would ride forth conquering and to conquer, and the caufe
</p>
<p>would probably flonrifh more than it has done fince the fettlement
</p>
<p>of the country. This rehgion has before combated more powerful
</p>
<p>enemies, and has been mofl triumphant, when its oppofers have
</p>
<p>been in the open field. Thofe men, who join the cry of the church is
</p>
<p>in danger, and appoint to olhce fuch men as our federal leaders, then
</p>
<p>cry, the church is out of danger, are unioniflts, their religion may

</p>
<p>men  and if the federalifls of New-England are fatisfied with

<p>fiich work, it is for want of real refped for the chriflian caufe.
</p>
<p>The religion of the gofpel breathes a fpirit of peace, and teach-
</p>
<p>es every grace and virtue ; but the religion of church and flate

<p>fhould recollect, that if thefe men fhould refent my charges, fuch
</p>
<p>refentment will prove the charges well applied ; for chriflianity
</p>
<p>beareth all things with patience : Every hypocrite is diftreffed at
</p>
<p>a charge of hypocrify, efpecially if he depends on it for a living.
</p>
<p>Some cool men fee the truth of thefe charges ; but judge it befl to
</p>
<p>be at peace for the prefent : Let fuch recoiled: that a like coolnefs
</p>
<p>and fear of offending, has reduced to fervitude whole nations,
</p>
<p>and that it has cofl miUions of lives to regain what might have
</p>
<p>been fecured by a decided attitude at the outfet. Some republi-
</p>
<p>Jl
</p>
<p>cans fear the confequence of a difclofure of the truth ; but do
</p>
<p>fuch men recoiled any moment, when a tyrant relaxed, becaufe
</p>
<p>his victims were lamb-like ?
</p>
<p>' I do not contend that republican civilians are fitter than federal
</p>
<p>civilians to manage the concerns of religion : but I contend that
</p>
<p>if all the federal unionifts were to remove out of New-England,
</p>
<p>chriftianity would not lofe by it, and if it be really hazardous for
</p>
<p>republicans to exprefs opinions refpe<5ting our great men, we need
</p>
<p>no aftronomer to calculate the period, when our rights will be in
</p>
<p>a narrower compafs.
</p>
<p>I would not levy a war of opinions againft a man, becaufe he
</p>
<p>had the plague ; but in this condition he fhould not be phyfician to
</p>
<p>my family. I would not combat our clerical politicians and their
</p>
<p>affociated civilians, becaufe they are attacked with that complica-
</p>
<p>tion of political depravity, which is diilrudive to civil and reli-
</p>
<p>gious liberty; (their minds are as liable to be depraved by bad
</p>
<p>paffions as their bodies are by difeafe) but in this condition they
</p>
<p>fhould not be my preachers nor lawgivers. If raving with their
</p>
<p>malady they attack me, and in the fpirit of extermination aim to
</p>
<p>force me from all my rights, to fmk me beneath my rank in being,,
</p>
<p>to lord it over my confcience and my peace, I muft defend my-
</p>
<p>felf.

<p>Fondnefsfor idol-worfhip and a religion confident with human

<p>every vice and commanded every moral virtue. Following their

<p>own propenfities, they foon changed the glory of the incorruptible
</p>
<p>God into an image made like unto corruptible man, and at the be-
</p>
<p>gining of the fecond period we find thera abounding in fornis,
</p>
<p>but deftitute of fubftance  having a convenient religion for this
</p>
<p>world, jull fuited to the ambition of the rulers. The invifible ob-
</p>
<p>jeft of worfhip was again announced, the law and the true wor/hip
</p>
<p>revived, anew and living way opened, but this was a declaration
</p>
<p>of war againft all which was efteemed great and good in that day.
</p>
<p>The new religion took tffet ; but at the opening of the third peri-
</p>
<p>od, v/e find it wholly changed, and the wife, mighty and noble who
</p>
<p>were not called, to have taken the ground, which was to have
</p>
<p>been occupied by the weak, and the' poor. The reformation
</p>
<p>reftored this religion to its firft principles, and the prefent view
</p>
<p>exhibits all which is vifible of this kingdom under the control of
</p>
<p>kings and their courts, high priefh and rulers, drawing million?

<p>from the people by the force of law, difpofing of titles and atten-

</p>
<p>Our unionills have not only formed this confpiracy in view of

<p>all thefe preceding ones, but with actual knowledge that fimilar

<p>unions of church and ftate for the fame fecular purpofes are

<p>operating in other nations, and in order that no doubt of the

<p>unionifts that he (houid even profefs to believe. For other quali-
</p>
<p>fications of admifiion are invented by our great worldly churches.
</p>
<p>The confpiracy of the Jews was not evidenced merely in their
</p>
<p>having changed the laws of the true religion ; but they had givea
</p>
<p>the higheft honors of their church and nation to men, who de-
</p>
<p>ferved and met the feverelf reproofs of the Saviour. His woes
</p>
<p>were pronounced on thofe who fat in Mofes' feat. Thefe bound
</p>
<p>heavy burdens on the people did th^ir works to be feen of men 
</p>
<p>loved the chief feats in the fynagogues  fhut up the kingdom

</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>then made him two-fold worfe than themfelves ; yet thefe conlpira-
</p>
<p>tors, with fuch men in the feat of Mofes, were fo confident of
</p>
<p>their ftrength that they ftoned Stephen, imprifoned Paul and
</p>
<p>Silas, fcourged and perfecuted the faints. The Catholics perverted
</p>
<p>the true religion as much and placed as bad men in the chair of
</p>
<p>St. Peter. Our unionifls have completed the firfl: point in the
</p>
<p>confplracy by calling the wife, mighty and noble and every man,
</p>
<p>who could claim an inheritance of the woes, pronounced in the
</p>
<p>23 of Matthew, to high rank in the church : whether they have
</p>
<p>fecured the fecond point by confpiring againft the fpirit of Chrift's
</p>
<p>kingdom muft be decided by a comparifon of the fpirit of the
</p>
<p>gofpel with that of church and ftate religion.
</p>
<p>The fpirit of the gofpel is firft pure, then peaceable, gentle and
</p>
<p>eafy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without par-
</p>
<p>tiality and without hypocrlfy. It takes man from his origin, with
</p>
<p>every propenfity to evil, fhews that his greateft enemies are the
</p>
<p>lufts, which war againft the foul  that the leader of thefe enemies
</p>
<p>is fubtle in the work of deftru6lion  it offers him armour againft
</p>
<p>every foe, opens to him a kingdom on v/hich he may rely for pro-
</p>
<p>tection, fortifies him againft the evils of life, clothes him with
</p>
<p>humility, grants him a patient endurance of injuries, and for all
</p>
<p>his facrifices of honor and wealth offers him future rewards. The
</p>
<p>fame fpirit having fhewn him his worft enemies, next points him
</p>
<p>to the enemies of the church in the principalities of the world,
</p>
<p>which would avail themfelves of all thefe lufts, and of the fervice
</p>
<p>of fatan in the form of an angel of light, to deceive (if poflible)
</p>
<p>the very eled, and inftrudls him how he may aid the church and
</p>
<p>the world by oppofing the poHcy of the gofpel to wars, oppreffion,
</p>
<p>hatred, revenge and cruelty. The diftinft charafler of the gofpel
</p>
<p>is found in perfe<Sl reverence for the Father of the univerfe, in af-
</p>
<p>fe<51:ion for the, whole human race, in a conftant conflid within,
</p>
<p>and in conftant exertions without, to promote the caufe of truth

</p>
<p>men.'*
</p>
<p>As chriftianity aims to redeem man from the ruins of the fall,
</p>
<p>fo church and ftate has always aimed to reftore him to thefe ruins ;
</p>
<p>and to this policy are the kingdoms of the world and the armies
</p>
<p>and navies, which fupport them indebted for their majefty and
</p>
<p>power.
</p>
<p>Let this propofitlon in all its relations be compared with that of
</p>
<p>Robifon and Barruel and the preachers againft infidel philofophy,
</p>
<p>and then let candid men judge who are the confpirators againft
</p>
<p>chriftianity  whether vifionary philofophers and infidels, feleded
</p>
<p>from all ages and nations, connedled with the republicans of the
</p>

<p>their wealth and fplendor  with their weapons of war  with
</p>
<p>their victories and revenge  with the fpoils of their enemies
</p>
<p>with all their fchemes of national glory, before they can bow to
</p>
<p>the fpirit of the gofpel.
</p>
<p>In this number I have taken the fpiritual ground of the New-
</p>
<p>Teftament. He, who comes to this ground with a crown on his
</p>
<p>head, muft come bowing lowly to the crown of thorns on the head
</p>
<p>of his Saviour. He, who comes here with a mitre and lawn-
</p>
<p>fleeves mufl acknowledge the fuperior majefty of the robes of the
</p>
<p>Redeemer's righteoufnefs. He, who comes here with volumes
</p>
<p>of his own wifdom, mufl: acknowledge the fuperior wifdom of him
</p>
<p>who was wifer than Solomon. Kings muft bow before the king
</p>
<p>of kings, princes before the prince of peace, prelates before the
</p>
<p>high prieft of the church, leaders of armies before the captain of
</p>
<p>falvation, fathers of families before the univerfal Father, and
</p>
<p>children before the babe of Bethlehem.  Every expectant of im-
</p>
<p>mortality muft do fincere homage to him, who was laid in the
</p>
<p>grave and who arofe from the dead, and captives muft look for
</p>
<p>redemption to him who led captivity captive, and who in his
</p>
<p>triumphant afcent to heaven gave gifts unto men.  The riches of
</p>
<p>this world muft yield to the treafures laid up in heaven ; the
</p>
<p>luxuries of earthly tables to the bread and water of everlafting
</p>
<p>life, and the deareft connections on earth to love for him, who is
</p>
<p>the firft born among many brethren, fairer than the children of
</p>
<p>men.  The graves muft open to receive our departed friends  our
</p>
<p>confidence muft be placed in the father of the orphan and the
</p>
<p>huftjand of the widow, and all our affeflions iiipremely centered
</p>
<p>in that world, where tears (hall be wiped from every eye.
</p>
<p>This is a trancient view of the affedions, which muft character-
</p>
<p>ize every man, who is moved by the fpirit of the gofgel. He,
</p>
<p>who feels this fpirit will not be loud in profeffions nor oftentatious

<p>O credit is due to mere forms, becaufe the Jews and

<p>catholics had them in abundance of the moft foiemn and impreflive
</p>
<p>kind, merely to conceal their want of fmcerity. The bell of
</p>
<p>prayers and fermons may proceed from the worfl of men. No
</p>
<p>credit is due on this fubjeft to great theological fcience and artful

</p>
<p>the fcribes ? where is the difputer of this world ? are forever dif-
</p>
<p>pofed of by the gofpel. If the boaft of, I am of Paul and I of
</p>
<p>Apollas and I of Cephas were of any avail, the unionifts would
</p>
<p>abound in arguments. If the building of houfes' of worfhip, fet-
</p>
<p>tlement of paftors, gathering of churches, attendance on Sabbaths,
</p>
<p>and all thebufy out-door work of religion were proofs of piety,
</p>
<p>we have all thefe in abundance : but what are the fubftantial fads,
</p>
<p>by which our conformiry to, or variance from, the true church,
</p>
<p>may be decided ?
</p>
<p>Our revolution was managed under the aufplces of profeflions,
</p>
<p>favorable to civil and religious liberty, and it then appeared to the
</p>
<p>people and probably to many of the leaders that this was an open-
</p>
<p>ing of great triumphs in favor of true religion and the rights of men.
</p>
<p>The chrgy wifhed for the downfall of papal Babylon and protef-
</p>
<p>tant hierarchies, and the civilians wifhed for an end of oppreffion.

<p>revolution would rife into favor ; but he prefented to them the
</p>
<p>reftive temper of the people, the danger-, to religion and order,
</p>
<p>from an extention of liberty, the hazard of innovation, and
</p>
<p>promifed them perfonai aggrandizement. Our unionifts, thus
</p>
<p>(timulated, eftabliOied a government, in which every pafTion ope-
</p>
<p>Si
</p>
<p>rated ; man was exaiflly reftored to his onglnaF depravity, the
</p>
<p>church became a virtual hierarchy, and our nation affimilated to
</p>
<p>the kingdoms of the world in every article, wherein thofe are
</p>
<p>oppofed to chriftianity. New-England federalifm became a fyftem
</p>
<p>of paflions impetuous for war, wealth, revenge, pride and national
</p>
<p>greatnefs. The complete revolution, which thefe men have
</p>
<p>performed fhews the extreme variablenefs of the human charader,
</p>
<p>when under the dominion of the lufts, which war againfl the foul.
</p>
<p>At firft: we find them foremoft in the ardors of a conteft for liberty
</p>
<p>and religion ; afterwards full of the fame powers, againft which
</p>
<p>they had fought, leagued with their former domeftic and foreiga
</p>
<p>enemies, combating their former friends, adopting the very mea-
</p>
<p>fures, which they once abjured, and courting alliances with na-
</p>
<p>tions, which they once profefled to abhor. Next, in order to
</p>
<p>retain their power, we trace them in wide fpread. delujions and
</p>
<p>falfe alarms of danger, and (to give currency to thefe) affuming
</p>
<p>the impofing title of friends of order and good government, and' af-
</p>
<p>ter the lofs of their* power embodying thcmfelves in a confp'iracy
</p>
<p>againft the very religion and liberty, for which they pledged their
</p>
<p>all at the outfet. The Jews prefaced the evidences of their con-
</p>
<p>fpiracy with charging on the chriftians the fame crime. The
</p>
<p>Catholics burnt the true believers as confp'irators againft the truth.
</p>
<p>Th republicans, who were charged with confpiring againft religion
</p>
<p>and government, do not claim to rank with the difciples or mar-
</p>
<p>tyrs ; but the praftice of defigning men charging confpiracy on
</p>
<p>others is not a novel artifice.
</p>
<p>The confpiracy under this head is diftin<rL in charader, though
</p>

<p>our federal members of congrefs, all in favor of the extenfi^'e plans
</p>
<p>of the laft adminiftration and federal governors and counfellors
</p>
<p>annually drawing their political breath from the clergy. The third

<p>clafs confifts of federal lawyers, ardent feekers of rapid gains 5

<p>but willing to be promoted for the good of the caufe ! of federal
</p>
<p>merchants willing to be rich for the honor of the country  of fed*
</p>
<p>eral printers under clerical patronage  followed by all under-feek-

<p>ers of office, by all the enemies of our revolution  by all the craftf-
</p>
<p>men, who gain by them, and by multitudes who are learnt toccn-
</p>
<p>fider this combination the main-guard of the church.
</p>
<p>. This is a ftatement of church and ftate unionifts in their prefent
</p>

<p>ivhich are oppofed to the fpiiit of the gofpel, all profciTing to dc

<p>fend the church. In three of the northern ftates this union com-
</p>
<p>mands the weight of political influence and on its continuance are
</p>
<p>faid to reft the hopes of federalifm.
</p>
<p>The exclufive claim of this union to piety, order and peace, its
</p>
<p>high charges againft republicans, its hofHIe array againft our caufe

<p>render it important that we colle<5l our premifes at this point 6f our

<p>charge. Is not this the union, which has availed itfelf of the paflion
</p>
<p>for wealth, honors and dominion, ever fince the fettlement of this
</p>
<p>country ? Has it not always boafted of anceftral piety ? Has it not
</p>
<p>artificially kept up the ranks of its leaders and followers ? Has it
</p>
<p>not dealt largely in forms, profellions, myfteries and doctrines ? Sure-
</p>
<p>ly there is no other union of church and ftate in New-England 
</p>
<p>and there is no pretence that its prefent character is more heavenly
</p>
<p>than it formerly was. If then the kingdom of the Saviour has not
</p>
<p>changed its policy and fpirit, and if this union is ferving the world
</p>
<p>under pretence of ferving this kingdom, furely it is confpiring
</p>
<p>againft chriftianity.
</p>
<p>In every advance of this part of my fubjeft I have endeavored
</p>
<p>to keep your attention fixed on the certain oppofition of the fpirit
</p>
<p>of the gofpel to the fpirit of the world  and to direct your fearch
</p>
<p>after the confpirators againft chriftianity in the very places, where
</p>
<p>the Saviour faid that they would be found, and in the place where
</p>
<p>nature and reafon would teach you to feek them. It is now necef-
</p>
<p>fary to mark out the line, which feparates the kingdom of the
</p>
<p>Saviour from the governments of the world.  The fpirit of chrif-
</p>
<p>tianity extends juft fo far into the heart, affeftions, thoughts and

<p>adtions of mankind as any goodnefs is found. It increafes as faft
</p>
<p>as this goodnefs increafes, and is faid to have prevailed, wherever
</p>
<p>this goodnefs has gained the afcendency over natural depravity. It
</p>
<p>meets the lufts of the fiefh, the lufts of the eye and the pride of

<p>life, exadly on the frontiers of the kingdoms of this world. At

<p>If revelation is to be our guide, we are not to feek the fubje(5l&
</p>
<p>of the Saviour within the limits of this or that clafs of profef-
</p>
<p>fors ; but in every nation he, who feareth God and worketh right-
</p>
<p>eoufnefs, will be accepted of him. The inviiible power of the goC-
</p>
<p>pel of the kingdom extends far and wide, producing a vifible ef-
</p>
<p>fedl in ail its fubjeds, which effect is the evidence of the power.
</p>
<p>Church and ftate abhors the fpirituality of the gofpel : it delights
</p>
<p>in hearing that religion is a very good thing, that it keeps fociety
</p>
<p>in order  that refpefttothe clergy is very important, and that ci-
</p>
<p>vil rulers ought to fupport their influence. It is charmed to hear
</p>
<p>learned difcourfes or fpeculative theology ; but cannot endure the
</p>
<p>dulnefs of morality.
</p>
<p>When the governing of mankind by the aid of the clergy is
</p>
<p>regarded as being infinitely eafier than to govern them by fabftan-
</p>
<p>tial attention to their interefts ; when we lee all the paffions ready
</p>
<p>to enlift under fuch rulers, and when time and fenfe, with all the
</p>
<p>arguments of wealth and honors, court our acquiefcence in fuch
</p>
<p>government, v/e will not v/onder at finding fome of the clergy
</p>
<p>and laity joining in this work. A fandified man will have noth-
</p>
<p>ing to do with it : a pious man would not calmly take his feat in
</p>
<p>congrefs or at the council board, if he knev/ that inftead of being
</p>
<p>chofen by unbiafled votes, he v/as chofen through the influence of
</p>
<p>falfe alarms about religion ; a pious man could not believe that a
</p>
<p>miferable worm of the duft like himfelf was important to the true,
</p>
<p>church.
</p>
<p>If our ambitious men can pafs oft profeiTions, the paper curren-
</p>
<p>cy of hypocrites, and receive in exchange as much of wealth and
</p>
<p>honors as they willi, we will not wonder at it. If by preaching

<p>the real gofpel a clergyman would offend the great men, and if
</p>
<p>preaching fubtle theology he can pleafe them, it can at kail be
</p>
<p>faid that it is extremely natural for him to choofe the laft: courfe.

<p>His falary is fecured by law, but the heirs of the kingdom are

<p>for their convenience. If they cannot believe in the truths of

<p>revelation, fome creed muft be made up for them, to which they

<p>can fubfcribe, and this muft be called revelation, and they muft be

<p>abflraft propofitions about the power of God, the agency of man,

<p>the origin of evil, and the myfteries of revelation. Believing in
</p>
<p>thefe is accepted in lieu of all the reft, and in the firfl rank of
</p>
<p>theories and profefTors ftand the followers of metaphyfical preach-
</p>
<p>ers. Good men may have come out from this clafs, but their

<p>goodnefs never began, till they left the regioa of inconceivable
</p>
<p>theories and pra6tifed plain duties. Nearly all our fafhionable
</p>
<p>fcarlet and fjie linen believers are found in the higheft regions of
</p>
<p>fpeculative theology. From thefe you pafs through many grades
</p>
<p>of profefTors, and as fad as this theory relaxes and gives place to

<p>pra6lice, fo faft you advance to the ground, which I firft took,
</p>
<p>where the humble believer in plain truths praiStifcs plain duties
</p>
<p>and looks for a future reward. The firft clafs follow an ingenious
</p>
<p>learned theorift to a magnificent houfe of wordiip, and are charm-
</p>
<p>ed with the fine polifh of his fentences and the gracefulnefs of his
</p>
<p>addrefs. The lad refort to fome lowly cottage, where no organ
</p>
<p>fwells its notes, no ornament decks the room, no polifiied, grace-
</p>
<p>ful preacher charms the ear ; but a humble man, who knows his
</p>
<p>God and duty, teaches his humble hearers the road to a heaven,
</p>
<p>where the miferaile diftindions of this world are unknown.
</p>
<p>It would be aftonifliing that fuch a fafhionable religion could be
</p>
<p>received as chriftianity by a people having the bible in their hands,
</p>
<p>did we not refled on the eternal eagernefs of men to have a reli-

<p>gion of their own making, and that church and flaie religion is

<p>exa6lly fitted to this eagernefs. Say to the rich, increafe your

<p>* Our unlonifls/^x the people for the fupport of chriflianity. More than
</p>
<p>70,000 dollars are annually coIlc6led in the parifhes of Conne<5licut for this
</p>
<p>purpofe, and the political clergy are very fevere on all who wifli this tax
</p>
<p>abolifhed. They are willing to trull their Maker for rain from heaven and
</p>
<p>fruitful feafons : They do not tax the people a vafl fum in order to bring
</p>
<p>water upon the meadows in cafe of drought ; but they cannot trufl the
</p>
<p>Saviour for a raia of grace and truth, although that is repeatedly promifed.
</p>
<p>Republicans have fufFered feverely, becaufe federalifts prefer their own to the
</p>
<p>Divine guidance. Every afTumption of civil power over Chrifl's church,
</p>
<p>whether by Buonaparte, George II!. or our northern unionifls, is a decided
</p>
<p>overt-a6l of confpiracy againfl chriftianity.
</p>
<p>Thofe, who argae that fuch tax is necejfary to the fupport of the gofpel are
</p>
<p>as deflitute of fkiU as they are of grace. If our religion cannot be fapported
</p>
<p>without fuch a tax, it foUowsthat the people have no inclination to fupport
</p>
<p>^^ 85
</p>
<p>gion, and you will have an abundant train cf leaders and foflou--
</p>
<p>ers ; colleges will literally make^lad your cities with a fupply of
</p>
<p>payors after j^'owr own hearts; the political preacher will blels you
</p>
<p>and pray for your proljierity, and the office-feeking lawyer will
</p>
<p>fubfcribe the tithe of his exadions tor your fupport, Thofe, who
</p>
<p>have cried that the church is in danger have aftually done all this !
</p>
<p>and if the gofpei is to be our guide, we are to regard them as
</p>
<p>confpiring againft its fpirit. ^ r n -
</p>
<p>Moft men fear to look at truth in this point, becauie molt gam
</p>
<p>either direftly or indiredly by fach a ftate.of thmgs ; yet the gain
</p>
<p>of all is far lefs than what religion, truth and aggregate _ foe iety
</p>
<p>lofe by it ; but there is great hazard in appearing on the minority,
</p>
<p>(as every man muft be for a time) on this fubjeft ; hence this
</p>
<p>world and its gains and honors are made to play a dreadful game
</p>
<p>aj^ainft- the other, and too often through the inibumentality of that
</p>
<p>clafs of men, who are exprefsly employed to fight the battles of
</p>
<p>heaven, truth and eternal righteoufnefs, agamft earth, falfhood
</p>
<p>and hell. Finding that the men of this world love their honors,
</p>
<p>pleafures and pelf, and that they are wiUing to pay for any accoai-
</p>
<p>modation to their tafte, fuch clergy leave virtually their caufe
</p>
<p>and turn againft their Lord.
</p>
<p>The preachers of myfteries and dark faylngs, and the dealers m
</p>
<p>fmooth, poliflied fentences are equally the objeds of thefc remarks.

<p>The firft gain admiration for their ingenuity in handhng fubjeds,
</p>
<p>which no one undeiftands, and the other charm by their addrefs
</p>
<p>in preaching what never roufes the confcience, touches the heart
</p>
<p>or influences the life. Thefe are not the preachers, who add to
</p>
<p>the church of fuch as fliall be faved ; but under them are ranged
</p>
<p>the fcientific, the rich, failiionable, debonair chriftians, whofe heads
</p>
<p>are full of religion, v/hole hearts are full of the world, and who
</p>
<p>take good caie that the right hand ihali never know what the left
</p>
<p>doth in aas of charity. Thefe are the chriftians, who hold the

<p>ecclefiaftics and their followers refleft how much our world has
</p>
<p>been afflifted by. their pride, their pomp and their hypocrify.
</p>
<p>Thefe men profefs to believe in the humble Jefus of Nazareth,
</p>
<p>but pay little refpe^ to thofe true difciples, who deftitute of wealth
</p>
<p>and honors are humbly feeking their way to him, through prayers,
</p>
<p>penitence, humiliations and faith ; but if they really loved him,
</p>
<p>it, and that our clergy would not engage In preaching without this fecurlty.
</p>
<p>It is true that church and ftate have been fo accullomed to an artificial reh-
</p>
<p>eion, that their religion would go to ruin, if they were fuddenly to withdraw
</p>
<p>their protei?ing duties. The day, when chtiftianity fliould be committed to the
</p>
<p>head of the church is a day, which our unlonllls wifh may never be num-
</p>
<p>bered among the days of the year: and lliould it ever arrive, they will, m
</p>
<p>the forenefs of their afflictions curfs it, as Job did the day of his birth.

<p>they would love his family, if they loved him, they would keep
</p>
<p>his commandments ; but they neither believe in nor love him nor
</p>
<p>would they refped him or his likenefs on earth. They believe in
</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate and Herod and the purple robes, and in the great
</p>
<p>ones of this world, and in lofty houfes, fplendid carriages and
</p>
<p>beds of down, and would fain psrAiade themfclves that in this
</p>
<p>lolling, eafy, luxurious attitude they may repofe on hini who had
</p>
<p>not on earth a place to lay his head.
</p>
<p>To retain the forms of chriftianity Is indifpenfible to the polit-
</p>
<p>ical obje6ls of our unionifts ; hence they avail themfelves of a fa6t,
</p>
<p>which long experience has eflabHfhed, viz. that it is eafier to pri-
</p>
<p>fefs to believe than to pra6life, and that a religion of faith is on this
</p>
<p>account the mofl popular and mod: eafy to be promoted. Mea
</p>
<p>love cheap ways of gaining honor on earth and glory in heaven.
</p>
<p>Hence the artful unionift, finding that his neighbors love the
</p>
<p>world, forms up a religion apparently on the gofpel, but in no
</p>
<p>refpect conformed to its temper, and offers this as chriftianity, even
</p>
<p>joins In its ordinances, talks loudly of its excellence, thunders
</p>
<p>againft his opponents, and thus enlifts a great portion of paffion in
</p>
<p>its favor  learns its votaries to curfe inftead of blefling  to per-
</p>
<p>fecute inftead of convincing  to talk of infidelity rather than to
</p>
<p>pradife morality  to avenge inftead of forgiving  and thus to
</p>
<p>ereft a fyftem of infidel philosophy on the benevolent religion
</p>
<p>of Jefus. This is precifely the ftate of things which the unionifts
</p>
<p>have produced in New-England, and by reafon of it the Saviour;
</p>
<p>of the world looks dov/n on a clafs of chriftians, far unlike to hina
</p>
<p>in charafter, chriftians, who deal largely in the theories of his
</p>
<p>religion, but who expend all the fire of their heavenly zeal with-
</p>
<p>in the circuit of political morality.
</p>
<p>Surely when we reilea: that the gofpel of the kingdom is not
</p>
<p>of this world  but that it is invifible and fpiritual, and when we
</p>
<p>caft our eyes upon the vifible religion of the unionifts ; when we

<p>their paffions and gains are conneded in the eftablifhment of this

</p>
<p>fpiracy againft the fpirit of the gofpel. Revelation and our

<p>experience join to affift us in drawing fair inferences. We never

<p>read of any clafs of men, fituated as thefe, who were pious
</p>
<p>chriftians; but from the days of Conftantine (anno. 323)
</p>
<p>who firft availed the Roman empire of an union of church and

<p>ftate, to the prefent day, every nation in Chriftendom has led up

<p>The brightefl feafon of chriftiaiiity was when it was wandering
</p>
<p>aboTtit in fheep-flcins and goat-fi<ins, perfecuted, afflicted, torment-
</p>
<p>ed, and when martyrs were fealing the truth of it with their blood.
</p>
<p>Thofe who ^iih to fee it in high places, furrounded with fpiendcr
</p>
<p>and who feek to find its friends or enemies by any other guide than
</p>
<p>that of revelation are confpiring againft the fplrit of the gofpel.

<p>NO. Fill.

<p>Account current on this charge of corifpiracy Jlated between the
</p>
<p>Unionijis and Republicans,
</p>
<p>N:
</p>
<p>EVER before this, fince the creation of the world,
</p>
<p>could fuch a charge of confpiracy have been made without certain
</p>
<p>hazard to the accufer. Men full of power could fafely charge
</p>
<p>confpiracy on their opponents and if they did not acquiefce in it,
</p>
<p>could fend an army with tlie logic of kings to enforce it ; but at
</p>
<p>the prefent moment the ferpent has loft his fting, and the devourer^s
</p>
<p>teeth are broken, and we are at liberty to examine thofc accounts,
</p>
<p>which ages of terror have fuppreffed.
</p>
<p>The firft article for adjuftment refts on the queftion, why feder-
</p>
<p>alills as fuch fhould confpire againft chriftianity, and why republicans
</p>
<p>as fuch fhould wifh to detcifl and repel the confpiracy ? I have anti-
</p>
<p>cipated, in part, the folution of this queftion, but it remains to
</p>
<p>remark that as republicanifm is the poor man's government, fo
</p>
<p>chriftianity is the poor man's religion  and if the religion will not
</p>
<p>foften the heart, yet it may check the force, and in any cafe it will
</p>
<p>give patience to endure whatever political evils the powerful ene-
</p>
<p>mies of the common people can devife.
</p>
<p>It has been natural for federalifts in every age of the chriftian
</p>
<p>church to retain the forms of chriftianity, even to abound in them,
</p>
<p>becaufe thefe forms would turn to their account, but to confpire
</p>
<p>againft the fubftance, becaufe it oppofed their policy, and thus
</p>
<p>doing they were not in hazard as refpeded the concerns of this
</p>
<p>world, becaufe they had the power of making laws and could
</p>

<p>armies and baftilcs can difpenfe with the laws of religion ; but the
</p>
<p>poor fubje^l, whofe all depends on the caprice of fuch lords,
</p>
<p>is willing to have the aid of religion, becaufe even if it does not
</p>
<p>protedl his rights, it will punifti his opprefibr. Our federalifts
</p>
<p>when full of power muft necefiarily have hated that fpiritual influ-
</p>
<p>ence, which was oppofed to all their fyftems of war and wealth,
</p>
<p>88
</p>
<p>\ =^ -
</p>
<p>and if powerful clergymen were willing to combat the fubflance^
</p>
<p>but to retain the forms, and then to enlift thofe forms in favor of
</p>
<p>federalifm, they would thereafter earn a feat on a fpiritual bench in
</p>
<p>the fenate. No federalift underftood the real tendency of his party,
</p>
<p>if he devoutly wiflied for the prevalence of pure and undefiled
</p>
<p>religion.
</p>
<p>It was perfectly natural for republicans as fuch to wifh for the
</p>
<p>deftrudion of falfe religion, for the humiliation of the political
</p>
<p>clergy, and for an end of an ariflocratic government ; but let me
</p>
<p>afk, what earthly motive could they have for wifhing the deflruc-
</p>
<p>tion of chriflianity ? Civil power was wholly in federal hands and
</p>
<p>did thofe wifh to free their opponents from reftraint  and that thefe
</p>
<p>ihould be let loofe on them with all their pallions, efpecialiy after
</p>
<p>having feen their temper ? You may fuppofe republicans to be infidels
</p>
<p>or atheifis, yet you v/ill allow that fome of them underftood well
</p>
<p>their political interefls, and could it be their interefl that a reli-
</p>
<p>gion, which is faid to inculcate peace, humility and univerfal
</p>
<p>benevolence fhould be aboliflied ? Could a republican wifh that his
</p>
<p>federal neighbors fhould feel no obligation to be kind and affeftion-
</p>
<p>ate to him and to relieve him, when he fhould be aiHidled in body,
</p>
<p>mind or eflate ? While religion fhould be in force he would have
</p>
<p>a claim on them to do to him as they would wifh him to do to them
</p>
<p>in fimilar circumflances, and is it common for creditors to pray
</p>
<p>that their debtors may be releafed from their bonds ? 
</p>
<p>To pretend that republicans wifhed the deflru<51:ion of chriftianity
</p>
<p>in order that they might fin more abundantly, is jufl as weak as to
</p>
<p>pretend that a man, wlio wifhes to fin againfl as much light as he
</p>
<p>can, would pray that the fun and every other fource of light fhould
</p>
<p>be extinguifhed. If a man wiflies to be a confpicuous fmner he
</p>
<p>will not take pains to make^ all neighboring finners confpicuous any
</p>
<p>more than the man, who wifhes to be eminently rich would wifh to
</p>
<p>have mines of filver and gold opened to all the world. The
</p>
<p>prifoner, who has broken his bonds, will not awaken his keeper,

</p>
<p>and if republicans had broken loofe from reflraint, y^t they
</p>
<p>would have left every federalift to repofe in a rel-igion, which
</p>
<p>calmed his paffions and prevented the ardors of purfuit. We will
</p>
<p>not be thought fo tolerant as to wifh the friends of order to be
</p>
<p>releafed from the little remnant of reflraints, which the forms of
</p>
<p>religion impofed. We wifli that the political clergy and civilians
</p>
<p>were real chriflians.
</p>
<p>But what defperatlon could drive republicans to wifh that after
</p>
<p>all religion fhould be dePiroyed, there fhould be an end of govern-
</p>
<p>ment l Had they lofl: all ambition to rule ? Or had alien and fedi-
</p>
<p>tion a6ts, funding and war fyftems, imprifonment and conflant
</p>
<p>privation of rights fo deflroyed their faculties as to deftroy all wifh
</p>
<p>for pcrfonal power, all regard to property and reputation ? Fed-
</p>
<p>eral meafure? under Mr, Adams were calculated to perplex and
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>diftrefs the republicans ; but no one of them, who was reputed to
</p>
<p>underfland the poHtics of his party, ever breathed a wifh that all
</p>
<p>religion and government might be deftroyed. The efiablifhment
</p>
<p>of chriftianity in the fpirit and power of it would have fecured
</p>
<p>them all the political bleflings, which they profefTed to wifii.
</p>
<p>But another queftion arifes, how happens it that our governors
</p>
<p>and counfellors and clergy are To generally in favor of federalifm,
</p>
<p>and that thofe, who raife this charge of confpiracy, have no
</p>
<p>eminence in church and ftate ? This happens juft as the fame fet
</p>
<p>of fadls has always happened, and for reafons, which have been partly
</p>
<p>explained in the firft part. Give to us the command of the wealth
</p>
<p>and honors of fociety and allow us a century to take our ground,
</p>
<p>let us make our own friends rich, let us engage clergymen on an
</p>
<p>implick covenant to fupport our rulers, and choofe our rulers of thofe
</p>
<p>only, who explicitly fupport fuch clergy, let us admit to communion
</p>
<p>on eafy terms, give us the command of the colleges and prefTes,
</p>
<p>let us ridicule you on commencement days, mifreprefent you
</p>
<p>through the week, and on the Sabbath report that you are in league
</p>
<p>with infernal fpirits, let us pray and preach for our fide, and bellow
</p>
<p>all offices in church and ftate on thofe, who adhere to us, and
</p>
<p>the ftate of things in fuch cafe would be a full anfwer under this
</p>
<p>head.
</p>
<p>We are not contending that federalifls are knaves In their pri-
</p>
<p>vate concerns : it is not their intereft to be fuch, and we allow
</p>
<p>that they a<5t naturally.  We do not deny that the political clergy
</p>
<p>appear to be as devout as they ought to be, it is their interell
</p>
<p>to be fo. We do not deny them the credit of talents. They
</p>
<p>have doubtlefs as much knowledge of ecclefiafticai hiftory and as
</p>
<p>much command of the arts of imprefling the eyes and ears of
</p>
<p>mankind as they ought to have. There is nothing pious or impious
</p>
<p>in all this. Any man of talents can do ail this ; but a man may
</p>
<p>be folemn as he will, may condemn his fellow men ever fo much,
</p>
<p>thefe forms as fuch deferve ho refped from the true chriflian ; they
</p>
<p>do not conftitute the hidden man of the heart.

<p>But the unionifts have made a great cry about infidel philofophy,
</p>
<p>and in thefadl of its exijlence they are very accurate. A fhort recur-
</p>
<p>ence to ecclefiaftical hiilory will lead us to the chara(5lers, who
</p>
<p>ought to be charged with it. Between the years 1096 and 131 1
</p>
<p>were eight crufades to the holy land. The foundation of thefe
</p>
<p>was a fuperftitious veneration for the places, where the Saviour had
</p>
<p>performed his miracles. With a pretence of driving infidels from
</p>
<p>thefe places, the pope and many princes of Europe availed them-
</p>
<p>felves of the refpeft of the multitude for^ religion, and raifed
</p>
<p>immenfe armies. ** At this time Europe was funk in the moft
</p>
<p>** profound ignorance and fuperftition,^the ecclefiaftics had gaine4
</p>
<p>i* an invincible afcendency over the human mind and thofe people,
</p>
<p>" who committed the moft horrid crimes and diforders^ knew of
</p>
<p>M
</p>
<p>9-0
</p>
<p>** no other atonements than the obfervances impofed o,n them by
</p>
<p>" their fplrltual paftors. The greateft criminals were forward
</p>
<p>** in a fervice, which they confidered an expiation for all crimes.
</p>
<p>* The nobles were moved to hope for opulent eftablifhments in
</p>
<p>** the eaftj and the phrenzy extended even to many aged and infirm,
</p>
<p>" who joined the expedition in hopes of breathing their lafl: in
</p>
<p>** fight of the city of Jerufalem." A crofs was difplayed
</p>
<p>on every arm, the name of Jefi.is was on every tongue : yet never
</p>
<p>did the light fliine on a fet of men, who had lefs of real religion ;
</p>
<p>they committed all manner of depredations and cruelties on the
</p>
<p>route, and when they fucceeded in taking Jerufalem the numerous
</p>
<p>garrifon and the inhabitants were maflacred without difl:in<5lion, and
</p>
<p>even after this barbarity they marched over heaps of dead bodies
</p>
<p>to the holy fepulchre, and " while their hands were yet polluted
</p>
<p>** with the blood of fo many innocents, fung anthems
</p>
<p>** to the common Saviour of mankind."  Such was the chara(5ler
</p>
<p>of man in the ii, 12 and 13 centuries, and fuch has it ever
</p>
<p>remained, capable of being deluded by (hadows, and of being led
</p>
<p>to do honor to the Saviour by means mod difgraceful to his caufe ;
</p>
<p>and there have never been wanting leaders, who were ready to
</p>
<p>conduifl not only the credulous, well difpofed, aged and infirm ;
</p>
<p>but the moft worthlefs of fociety, faying, 'we are holy^ nve are
</p>
<p>purcy religion depends on z/j, nve are on the high road to jferufahm.
</p>
<p>Our unionilb, with no more apparent fandity and with no bet-
</p>
<p>ter motives, have led up a crufade againfl: republicans under a
</p>
<p>charge of infidel philofophy, and though they have not put arms
</p>
<p>into the hands of their followers, yet they have put purpofes into
</p>
<p>their heaits, not more benevolent than thofe, which governed the
</p>
<p>former crufadcs. I have already prefented the motives of our
</p>
<p>unionifts : To you will be fubmitted the merits of a comparifon.
</p>
<p>It cannot be the caufe of Chrift which excites a minifter of the
</p>
<p>gofpel to become a political partizan ; It cannot be the caufe of
</p>
<p>Chrift, which excites infidel civilians to profefs chriftianity : but

<p>our political priefts and federal rulers. Human nature has not
</p>
<p>changed : the ftate of fociety has introduced new arts of deceit ;
</p>
<p>but crufaders againft civil and religious liberty will probably be found
</p>
<p>in every age, and they will always come prophefying in the name
</p>
<p>of the Lord. The enemies of chriftianity and the enemies of
</p>
<p>all the opprefied men in the world have united in the fame char-
</p>
<p>acters, becaufe chriftianity demands a facrifice of thofe paffions,

<p>Acfount clofed between Clerical Uniojiijls and Republicans.
</p>
<p>- VV HEN men have loft confidence In eacli other it is
</p>
<p>lime for them to clofe their books and to fettle the balances. The
</p>
<p>clerical unionifts have fufficiently fhewn their want of confidence
</p>
<p>in us : They will pleafe to accept our moft unequivocal alTurance
</p>
<p>that we have none in them;
</p>
<p>This account is of long ftanding and has never been brought to
</p>
<p>i/Tue, becaufe the defendants in the prefent cafe have always occu-
</p>
<p>pied the bench, and the triers of fads have been packed juries,

<p>by a midnight law, nor created to fave the people from themfelves,
</p>
<p>but to protest their rights, we bring our caufe, and are fure of an
</p>
<p>impartial decinon.

<p>It is well known that men, who keep great books and who have

</p>
<p>many clerks, are very particular in their charges, and fometimes
</p>
<p>arbitrary, when they know that the debtor will not dare to difpute
</p>
<p>them. Men, who keep neither books nor clerks and who rely
</p>
<p>wholly on the other party, are in the habit of paying all which
</p>
<p>^
</p>
<p>they can fpare from the earnings of each year, to be careieCs
</p>
<p>about feeing whether it is palfed to their credit, to believe that
</p>
<p>their accounts are about equal, and after a long lapfe of time their
</p>
<p>whole eflates are infufficient to atone for their credulity, their lib-
</p>
<p>erty is taken and there is an end of them. The certain danger
</p>
<p>of delay and the rapidity with which the unionifts are adding to
</p>
<p>their charges induces us to clofe the account at this time.
</p>
<p>On Oyer of their books the firft charge againft the republicans is
</p>
<p>the rebellion, which fatan endeavored to excite in heaven, which
</p>
<p>was overpowered by Michael and his angels. Here the prince
</p>
<p>of the power of the air is confidered as the head of our firm, and
</p>
<p>we are charged with a deCign to dethrone the king of kings, to
</p>
<p>ufurp his dominion and to make pure fpirits fubmilTive to our in-
</p>
<p>fernal wills. TJiefe are the very words of the charge, and our
</p>
<p>orrly credit is the lofs of heaven, which, confidering our tempers,
</p>
<p>the unionifts regard as of fmall account.
</p>
<p>Thefecond charge is the fall of man. Here we are reprefent-
</p>
<p>d as in the form of a ferpent, ufing fubtlety to deceive the woman.
</p>
<p>In this charge the unionifts recognize themfelves in the perfon of
</p>
<p>Adam, made in the likenefs of God and poffcfling the pureft
</p>
<p>principles, previous to fedudion, and our only credit is the lofs
</p>
<p>of paradife.
</p>
<p>The next charge is the death of Abel, who, becaufe he brought
</p>
<p>of the firftlings of his flock and the fat thereof and offered
</p>
<p>unto the Lord, is claimed to be of their number, and Cain is placed
</p>
<p>fecond in our firm, and our only credit is, that Cain was accurfed
</p>
<p>from the prefence of the Lord and declared a fugitive and a vag-
</p>
<p>abond on the face of the earth.
</p>
<p>The next charge is, that all flefh had corrupted its way on the
</p>
<p>earth, and here the unionifts find themfelves in the perfons of
</p>
<p>Noah and his family, and our only credit is that we were over-
</p>
<p>whelmed by the waters of a mighty deluge. Thefe comprife the
</p>
<p>charges and credits in the firft age of the world. In the five
</p>

</p>
<p>unionifts recognize themfelves in the perfons of Abraham, Jofeph,
</p>
<p>Mofes and Aaron, David and Solomon, exerting themfelves for
</p>
<p>religion, order and good government, and charge the republicans
</p>
<p>in the perfons of the defcendants of Nimrod with building the
</p>
<p>Tower of Babel, in the perfons of Pharoah and his hoft purfuing
</p>
<p>thechofen people, and in the perfons of all, who rebelled againft
</p>
<p>God in the exhibition of the wickednefs of their hearts. Here
</p>
<p>we are credited by the deftru^ion of the tower of Babel, by being
</p>
<p>drowned in the Red Sea, by being conquered and led in:o cap-
</p>
<p>tivity ; but in the midft of thefe charges ftands confpicuou^ that
</p>
<p>of the Rev. Azel Backus, (in his ele(51ion fermon*) that Abfa-

<p>lom was a republican, and that the fame principles, which influ-
</p>
<p>enced us to oppofe the friends of order, were the fame which in-,
</p>
<p>fluenced him in his rebellion againft David, and that our arts to
</p>
<p>win the people were like to Abfalom's, when he faid,  O that I
</p>
<p>" were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any fuit
</p>
<p>" or caufe might come unto me and I would do him juftice."
</p>
<p>Here we are credited by having our heads caught in the boughs
</p>
<p>of a great oak and being taken up between the heavens and the
</p>
<p>earth, and being deferted by the mule from under us, and beinw
</p>
<p>thruft through the heart by the hand of Joab.
</p>
<p>In a later book opened by the clerical unionifls v/e find all the
</p>
<p>old charges and credits brought forward, and the head of our firm
</p>
<p>is charged with the ruined ftate of man, which induced the necef-
</p>
<p>iity of an atonement ; with attempting to bribe the Saviour with an
</p>
<p>offer of all the kingdoms of the world : then Judas is placed fecond
</p>
<p>of our firm in the room of Cain, and we are charged with betray-
</p>
<p>ing the Saviour ; with perfecuting his followers, and oppofing his
</p>
<p>church. Here the unionifts find themfelves in the charatflers of
</p>
<p>the holy apoftles, earneftiy contending for the faith ; and car only
</p>
<p>credit is, by the flings of confcience, the frowns of an angry God,
</p>
<p>and the reverfion of ceafelefs torments.
</p>
<p>In the laft book of the unioniib the whole account is brought
</p>
<p>forward, and they appear in their proper perfons, claiming, under
</p>
<p>the firm of Adams & Co. to charge us with all the confufions,
</p>
<p>diftrefTes and expences of the revolution ; with oppofmg the faluta-
</p>
<p>ry meafures of government ; with exciting the weilern infurrec-
</p>
<p>tion ; with enmity to order and fleady habits, and with confpiracy
</p>
<p>againft all religion and government. Here no credit is given us for
</p>
<p>aay fervices in the revolution ; for any lofTes by the funding fyftem ;
</p>
<p>for any imprifonments under the fedition law, nor for ail which we
</p>
<p>have fuffered under the ingenious tortures of the mild, pious and
</p>
<p>benevolent unionifts ; but we find the balance claimed againft us

<p>to be immenfe  and that thoufands of rams and ten thoufands of

<p>unionifts, as it would to atone for offences againft the Ruler of
</p>
<p>the Univerfe>
</p>
<p>On every ground we are induced to make our defence, and though
</p>
<p>this might be conclufively done by pleading that we were all born
</p>
<p>in the laft century, and that our fphere of ad:ion has been very-
</p>
<p>limited : yet if republicans lived in the remoteft ages of time and
</p>
<p>ought to have been thus charged by thefe unionifts, we affume on
</p>
<p>ourfelves the refponfibility. We deny generally that Satan, Cain
</p>
<p>or Judas had a right to involve us in debt, or that the clerical union-
</p>
<p>ifts have a right to charge us with thefe crimes which are common
</p>
<p>to themfelves and us, or which concern only the commerce between
</p>
<p>God and man. What connexion can be fliewn between the fallen
</p>
<p>angels in the aft of their making war in heaven and the republicans
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>of this country, who took a ferious part in the revolution, ex-
</p>
<p>pecHied a- governrnent of equal rights, failed of them, and for ex-
</p>
<p>preffing their difappointment were configned to prifons or reproach ?
</p>
<p>What analogy between rebellion againlt the Creator and oppolition
</p>
<p>to Mr. Adams' adminiftration ? what refemblance between Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Hamilton and his army and Michael and his angels ? Clerical
</p>
<p>unionifts have prefented fuch comparifons ! Since the appointment
</p>
<p>of Mr. Jefferfon has deftroyed the application of the event of that
</p>
<p>rebellion, viz. the fall from heaven, we Oiall be certainly releafed
</p>
<p>from this charge.
</p>
<p>As to the fall of man we have received no new light on this
</p>
<p>fubjefl from all the doftrines of federal reprefentation in Adam,
</p>
<p>and of imputation of fin. We can only fay that we h*ad nothing to

<p>do with this fall, and that it is enough for us to bear the confequen-
</p>
<p>ces of it, which have been moft dreadfully experienced from the
</p>
<p>tyrants of the world. We fee nothing in the character of Cain
</p>
<p>in any way refembling ours : for we profefs to be enemies to the
</p>
<p>(hedding of blood with br without provocation. Our principles
</p>
<p>would never have led us to the building of the tower of Babel ;
</p>
<p>we are oppofed to coflly edifices. We could gain nothing by join-
</p>
<p>ing the king of Egypt in purfuing the Ifraelites ; Republicans are
</p>
<p>never voluntarily found in the armies of kings, efpecially to ar-
</p>
<p>refl: thofe who are flying from opprelfion. As to the refemblance
</p>
<p>between Abfalom and the republicans, we regard it as a mere effort
</p>
<p>of wit, intended to fhew that the fcriptures might mean any thing
</p>
<p>or nothing. It was high time indeed that judges fhould have done
</p>
<p>the people juftice ; for " judgment had been turned away back-
</p>
<p>ward, juftice (lood afar off, truth had fallen in the ftreets and equi-

</p>
<p>to refemble Abfalom to any man or fet of men, whom he wiflied
</p>
<p>to abufe. We claim to be exempted from thefe charges becaufe
</p>
<p>no refemblance has been ftiewn betv/een the agents and us : but

<p>furely when we have been called poor, ignorant and depraved, we
</p>
<p>cannot be fufpedled of any agency in betraying that Saviour, who
</p>
<p>came exprefsiy to exalt and to fave jurt fuch a clafs of chara<^ers,
</p>
<p>and experienced revilings, perfecutions and crucifixion from men,
</p>
<p>reported to be fuch as have exhibited thefe charges againft us.
</p>
<p>In expe<flation of a releafe from fuch charges, we offer to releafe
</p>
<p>the credits, which they have given us, of a fail from heaven,
</p>
<p>of the lofs of paradife, of baniihment, of fudden deftrudlion and
</p>
<p>of eternal ruin.
</p>
<p>Thefe unionifts have not fought us in ancient hiftory, where we
</p>
<p>fhould naturally have been found. They fliould have fought us
</p>
<p>among a clafs of poor untitled men, paying annually, whatever we
</p>
<p>could gain, to the order of imperious mailers. They might have
</p>
<p>95
</p>
<p>found us in prifon-fiiips, or chained to the o^r or among heaps
</p>
<p>of (lain in the field of battle. Republicans have not been exalted
</p>
<p>among the nations. You may find them among the fufFering and
</p>
<p>opprefTed of every language and people, never ceafing to endure,
</p>
<p>fo long as political evils were tolerable, and never rifing for
</p>
<p>redrefs, till refolved to meet all which the force and fubtlety of
</p>
<p>their oppreflbrs could prepare for them.
</p>
<p>As all the laft clafs of charges will be fubje<fls of confideration
</p>
<p>in the 3d part, our fumraary defence here Is, that ur Intereft has
</p>
<p>been uniformly oppofite to the charadler, which we are faid to
</p>
<p>deferve, ^nd that the charges againft us are of fo grofs and malignant
</p>
<p>an afpedl as muft leave on the public mind no other impreffion
</p>
<p>than that our accufers have not been reftrained by confiderations
</p>
<p>of truth or reafon in their attempts to compafs our ruin.
</p>
<p>Our great misfortune has been, that the vital enemies of repub-
</p>
<p>licanifm have been our accufers, witneffes againft us, our judges
</p>
<p>and executioners, and that we have never before had a day in
</p>
<p>court. We improve the firft feafon of a new order of things to
</p>
<p>exhibit a few charges : and though we might, by reference to
</p>
<p>hiftory, fliew that the world has been extremely diftreifed by cler-
</p>
<p>ical unionifts ; yet under the prefent head we could reiy on fuch
</p>
<p>reference merely as proof that charges like ours have been juftly
</p>
<p>made againft a fimilar clafs of men.
</p>
<p>We find a number of m.en, fettled in the different focieties of
</p>
<p>New-England, profeffing to be preachers of the gofpel of the
</p>
<p>kingdom, to be fuccefibrs of thofe, who were fent forth to teach
</p>
<p>the gofpel to every creature, profeffing it their bufinefs to feed the
</p>
<p>flock of God, and to bring home loft (heep to the fhepherd of
</p>
<p>fouls. We have not fuffered them to be deftitute as were the firft
</p>
<p>preachers, nor have- we, like the Catholic church, deprived them
</p>
<p>of the comforts of domeftic life. They and their families are as
</p>
<p>well fituated as any clafs of people in New-England, and they
</p>
<p>enjoy a greater degree of refpeft, in proportion to their talents and
</p>
<p>labors, than any other clafs. Theirs are the firftlings of the flock

<p>and the fat thereof, and their fupport, fecured by law, is drawn
</p>
<p>from all claffes of men in proportion to their rateable property.
</p>
<p>If they would preach the gofpel intelligently and leave the politics
</p>
<p>of this world to civilians, they would be reprobated by no man,
</p>
<p>they would improve the condition of focieiy, the eye which faw,
</p>
<p>would blefs them, and the ear, which heard, would bear witnefs
</p>
<p>of their fidelity : but with all this preparation what have they,
</p>
<p>done for a few years part ?
</p>
<p>They have eftabliflied miffionary focieties in order to " profelyte
</p>
<p>to a particular faith," the people of Vermont and of the northern
</p>
<p>{)arts of the ftate of New-York and fome Indian tribes ; and fever-
</p>
<p>al federal paftors, contrary to folcmn covenant, have left their
</p>
<p>unconverted flocks in order to attend fuch miiHons and have then
</p>
<p>9^
</p>
<p>written juft fuch letters to their employers as all fuch miflionaries
</p>
<p>had before written and an Evangelical Magazine has been publifhed
</p>
<p>containing thefe letters. A fingle new fa6t has appeared of late,
</p>
<p>viz. that one of the miflionaries, having written inftrudtions as to
</p>
<p>the courfe of his miflion, thought it his duty to vary from his in-
</p>
<p>ftruftions, and being in great doubt and after imploring divine gui-
</p>
<p>dance, providentially fell in company with the honorable and /iowj
</p>
<p>Uriah Tracy, whom Mr. Adams had fent on a miflion to infpedl
</p>
<p>the weftern fortifications, and Mr. Tracy concluded that he ought
</p>
<p>to obey God rather than man. Thus gracioufly inftruded, he
</p>
<p>broke his orders. This forms one exception from the general re-
</p>
<p>mark ; but thefe miflionary focieties with us are made up wholly of
</p>
<p>the unionifts and if they are not vifibly for political purpofes, yet
</p>
<p>the inftitution of them is not more rational than it is for an hufband-
</p>
<p>man to leave his farm half fown in feed-time and to wander abroad
</p>
<p>for employment. New-England needs the unceafing, undivided
</p>
<p>and confcientious fervices of all its clergy ; but fuch inflitutions
</p>
<p>infidioufly court the chara<5ter of that charity, which covers a
</p>
<p>multitude of fins and are therefore popular. Republicans do not
</p>
<p>hefitate to declare that they have no lefyeOi for the motives, which
</p>
<p>originate thefe focieties ; they find civilians rifing into office on the
</p>
<p>credit of them : their political afpedt betrays them. The gofpel
</p>
<p>has no blefTednefs for the ihepherd, who leaves his own flock '* to
</p>
<p>fcatter on the mountains." This charge applies moie generally to
</p>
<p>the clergy than any other; many of them (who are really confci-
</p>
<p>entious in their labors) have been drawn in by the plaufibility of this
</p>
<p>meafure.
</p>
<p>Another, next in political artifice, has been the preaching of
</p>
<p>fermons againft infidelity. Thefe originated in a defign to hum-
</p>
<p>ble republicans. Infidel books did not abound, republicans could
</p>
<p>not have wifhed to abolifli chriftianity and not an infidel would
</p>
<p>have remained on earth, provided the preachers, inftead of fuch
</p>
<p>war-meafures, had fat down peaceably with their hearers, having
</p>
<p>the teftimony that in fimplicity and godly fincerity not with

</p>
<p>fleflily wifdom they had their coverfation in the world. Chriftian
</p>
<p>lives are the only conclufive arguments againfl: infidel writings ;
</p>
<p>chriftianity has fuffered more by injudicious attemps to defend it
</p>
<p>tl'ian by all attacks againft it. The watchman of Ifrael is abun-
</p>
<p>dantly able to guard his church and to caufe that no weapon
</p>
<p>formed againft it ftiall profper. Thofe, who are often alarming
</p>
<p>his followers, pay little refped to his vigilance or his promifes.
</p>
<p>We next charge the political clergy with regulating their prayers
</p>
<p>and other Sabbath exercifcs by the politics of the day, and with
</p>
<p>publicly promoting known infidels under a pretence of ferving the
</p>
<p>church. Under this head we do not blame them for praying gen-
</p>
<p>erally for the Prefident and adminiftration of the government, but
</p>
<p>for their partiality in this feryice. Surely if the bleflings and frowns
</p>
<p>El
</p>
<p>of heaven are to be under the control of a few half-informed
</p>
<p>partizans, -eur rights are in hazard. We blame them for implor-
</p>
<p>ing blelTings on thofe very meafures, which were manifeftly hcfHIe
</p>
<p>to chriftianity ; it is t-heir duty to oppofe the fpirit of the gofpei to
</p>
<p>the bad paffions of fociety.
</p>
<p>Knowing the frailty of man, we will allow them to compli-
</p>
<p>ment the jK)vernors, lieut. governors, counfellors and members
</p>
<p>of congrefs, and the colleges, and the fleady habits ; but they
</p>
<p>ought to premife all this by faying that they are afting in their
</p>
<p>political capacities, after the manner of men and not after Chrift.
</p>
<p>To convert that flock of influence, v/hich the people had laid up
</p>
<p>for the good of their fouls, to the deilrudtion of their civil rights,
</p>
<p>cannot be a trifling violation of duty.
</p>
<p>The eftablifhment of the Palladium combines many points of
</p>
<p>the political characters of our clerical unionifts. The expofure of
</p>
<p>thefe has been done mod efFe(5lually in the tenth number of the
</p>
<p>Farmer. The falfliOods and intentional mifreprefentations of the
</p>
<p>Palladium deferve lefs notice than its general tendency to promote
</p>
<p>the interefts of church and ftate by meafures manifeftly hoftile to
</p>
<p>chriftianity. If that paper had gained its object, the republicans
</p>
<p>of New-England would have been laid in the daft ; the Prefident
</p>
<p>would have been hurled from his feat as an ufurper, and we fhould
</p>
<p>have been at war with the fouthern ftates. It is in proof before
</p>
<p>the public that church and ftate ereded that paper as a grand
</p>
<p>refervoir of political poifons : Church and ftate have dug channels
</p>
<p>for its ftreams.
</p>
<p>We know that the deflc is a ftrong fortrefs, and that the clerical
</p>
<p>unionifts have garrifoned it with the fame troops, which wciVe
</p>
<p>formerly fighting againft the Saviour ; they have enlifted all the
</p>
<p>paflions. We know that they can fulminate againft us ; that they
</p>
<p>can defame and vilify us, and that as their troope were enemies
</p>
<p>of the Saviour, their weapons will be *' debates, envyings,
</p>
<p>wraths, ftrifes, back-bitings, whifperings and tumults ;" but m

<p>their inftruments and their means, has declared that their triumph-
</p>
<p>ing will be ftiort.
</p>
<p>The fame glory which they are gaining, has been before gain-
</p>
<p>ed by fuch men and meafures. The art of fecuring the favor of
</p>
<p>rich and proud men by laying the gofpei at their feet is not an
</p>
<p>invention of the prefent day. Thoufands of clerical unionifts,
</p>
<p>who kept the company of Dives in the prefent world have com-
</p>
<p>menced their eternity of torments v/ith him, and thofe New-Eng-
</p>
<p>land clergy, who have facrificed their profefHons in order to
</p>
<p>facrif^ce the'peoiple's rights, will ere long join their company.
</p>
<p>Thofe men, who preach of torments iox political purpofcs will do
</p>
<p>well to hear of torments for the fame purpofes. The republicans
</p>
<p>of New-England do not difguife their fulleft perfuafion that the
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>98
</p>
<p>xrkricai unionifts were never converted, that they are in heart
</p>
<p>infidels of the mod dangerous kind, that their praying, preaching
</p>
<p>and examples tend to infidelity, and that not one of them has
</p>
<p>ever be-en improved as the inftrument of making a fingle convert.
</p>
<p>If our perfuafions are confidered as ill-founded, let the political
</p>
<p>unioniftbe named (with his own confent) as a real chriftiaB, and
</p>
<p>we offer to join ifTue on the point of his charader, and if
</p>
<p>comparing it with the gofpel and making all fuitable deductions for
</p>
<p>remainders of corruption and evil companions, it fhali appear that
</p>
<p>we have done him injuftice, the world will pronounce on us a
</p>
<p>fentence of exemplary feverity. Charging us with infidelity,
</p>
<p>atheifm and all manner of crimes will not be relevant : quotations
</p>
<p>from Mr. Jefferfon's notes will not fave a finking hypocrite, the
</p>
<p>queftion is, Are you, reverend mortal, a fervant of the king of
</p>
<p>kings or of the politicians of the day ? Where, reverend union-
</p>
<p>ifts, v/as chriftianity under the laft adminiftration ? Was it on
</p>
<p>board of a navy or at Union-camp in Jerfey, or was it eleftioneer-
</p>
<p>ing in New-England againfl: Mr. JefFerfon, or was it at Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams' levee or at our council board? Where did the uniofiifls
</p>
<p>exhibit their forces during thofe four years ? Pious preachers were,
</p>
<p>daring this time, preaching the gofpel ; pious chriftians were
</p>
<p>pradifing chriftianity ; but the clerical unionifts were in every
</p>
<p>political conteft, making powerful exertions to reftore the old
</p>
<p>order of things, in which ignorance was to take the lead, fear to
</p>
<p>follow in its train  honors, wealth and power to grace the rulers,
</p>
<p>energy to crufh oppofition, the lords fpiritual and temporal to
</p>
<p>ride the whirlwind and dire<5l the ftorms and the feafon of peace
</p>
<p>on earth and good will to men, to be adjourned to another century
</p>
<p>and another continent. In thofe days zeal for liberty was an
</p>
<p>offence ; zeal for toleration a high crime and oppofition to the
</p>
<p>clerical unionifts, confpiracy againft God, againft all religion

</p>
<p>political clergy, that they have been faithful to Adams and liberty I
</p>
<p>and that they have conformed to the whole routine of federal
</p>
<p>rightcoufnefs, to fuch nothing can be addreffed ; but let others
</p>
<p>difpofe of the firft imprelTions ^ thefe charges by refleding what
</p>
<p>the Jews thought when their chief priefts and rulers were de-
</p>
<p>nounced  what the Catholics thought, when their holy father and
</p>
<p>cardinals were denounced. To them it appeared as if all religion
</p>
<p>would fuffer by the convi<51ion of fuch leaders ; yet thefe leaders
</p>
<p>with all their ihew of fandtity, were h^^pocritcs. After every
</p>
<p>reformation there is always lefs appearance of religion than there
</p>
<p>was in the midft of impofture. The firft momeRts of a revohtien
</p>
<p>99
</p>
<p>are more dlftreffing than the t3'ranny ; the fir fi: pangs of amputation
</p>
<p>greater than the pains which preceded the operation. The (late
</p>
<p>of religion requires a radical application and if you value your
</p>
<p>altars and your fouls more than you do the offices of juftices of
</p>
<p>the peace, reprefentatives, counfellors, &c. you will be in earncft
</p>
<p>for a reform. The religion of the unionifts in New-England is
</p>
<p>worfe than none, and however their vengeance may be directed
</p>
<p>againft the man who declares this ; yet the declaration is not lefs
</p>
<p>true. He calls them impoftors, if they fell the crofs for offices

<p>or favors. Ke takes from them the earthly rewards of piety, but

</p>
<p>in Chriilendom ; by them are to be tried the characters of men.
</p>
<p>It is not our v/iih to imprefs the public with any perfuaficns of
</p>
<p>our own faith or infidelity : wc take the fcriptures as we find
</p>
<p>them, and regard them as a faithful expofition of this religion,
</p>
<p>and we claim that thofe, v/ho profefs this religion, (hall praiftife it,
</p>
<p>inftead of merely ufing it as an inftrument of their ov/n glory in
</p>
<p>the d'.^llruftion of our caufe.
</p>
<p>The intruding of religion to federal or republican rulers is
</p>
<p>equally antichriftian. The invifible kingdoni muft be in the
</p>
<p>hearts of believers, and their lives mud: fliew that the gofpel reigns

<p>within. My abfolute knowledge of the men to whom I allwde,

<p>ar.d the certain hodility of the political temper of church and ftate

<p>to the temper of the gofpel, has emboldened me to expofe my

<p>pages to thofe exorcifms, tvh'tch tu'dl prove my charges to he corred,
</p>
<p>Thefe church and ftate reiigioniiis are very vindictive, and no
</p>
<p>man ought to expofe himfeif to their arts of terror, till he has
</p>
<p>learnt that their power like that of death is limited.
</p>
<p>Having hitherto improved fcrlpture language and ailufions in

<p>illuftration of my fubjeit, I fl-iall combine the different views of

<p>this part, by regarding fatan as the grand confpirator again{t

<p>fpiracy in England againlt chridianity and the rights of men ;
</p>
<p>but difcerned not the power and wealth, which rendered the

<p>deformity of this confpiracy invifible to their unionifts. Pafiion
</p>
<p>cloies men's eyes againft the perception of their own characfters,
</p>
<p>and fhuts their ears againft the complaints of the oppreffed.
</p>
<p>David difcerned not the application of the parable of Nathan,
</p>
<p>and Saul verily thought that he was doing God fervice, while he
</p>
<p>perfccuted the church. The defender of the faith, with his
</p>
<p>apoftles in the houfe of lords, and his civil and military officers,
</p>
<p>who partook ot the facrament once a year according to lanv as an
</p>
<p>atonement for exaftions and cruelties during the red of it, con-
</p>
<p>fidered chriftianity as in a thriving way : they were in full pof-
</p>
<p>fejTion of all the benefits of it, which they expefVed in this and
</p>
<p>a future world. We faw the wi9kednefs of all this, and regarded
</p>
<p>that kingdom as eminent among the dominions of fatan. We
</p>
<p>prayed and fought againfl: it, the words religion and liberti?
</p>
<p>were in capitals on the helmets of our foldiers. We fucceeded,
</p>
<p>and the feafon arrived for the trial of our integrity.
</p>
<p>To diipofe pf thofe magic words was difficult ; but it was ab-
</p>
<p>folutely impollible to fupport chrifttanity in its purity, and yet to
</p>
<p>have a government, poil'efling eneroy and power enough to ennoble
</p>
<p>and enrich the leaders. The people had borne and fufFered much ;
</p>
<p>but either they muit be facrificed or our Sampfons muft become
</p>
<p>weak as other men : Generals and ftatefmen mufl; retire to the
</p>
<p>ranks, and the nvell-boriiy and thofe, who were merely born, muft
</p>
<p>be on a level. Satan faw the crifis, favorable for the introduaion
</p>
<p>of thofe fyftems of fedudion, by which he had fubjugated the
</p>
<p>other continent. This fubfele courtier has a difcerning eye, which
</p>
<p>fuddeniy comprehends all the relations of things capable of ad-
</p>
<p>vancing his views. He faw the people honeftly and quietly refting
</p>
<p>after the fatigues of a war, few of them difpofed to contemplate
</p>
<p>any political intereft, except what immediately affefled them or
</p>
<p>their property, and ready to repofe coaiidence efpecially in thofe,
</p>
<p>who had led them in the revolution. He faw the opening tu-
</p>
<p>mults of Europe, as capable of aiding his views  the ocean
</p>
<p>wafhing our fhores and commerce offering its tribute. To change
</p>
<p>the temper of the leaders was his firft objea, and to compafs this
</p>
<p>he taught the tendency^ of liberty to anarchy, of toletation to
</p>
<p>infidelity, the neceliity of halaiic'mg all the pafiions of fociety in
</p>
<p>political fcales, ir.flead of fubjugating them, the inability of the
</p>
<p>people to govern themfelves, and the indifpenfible importance of
</p>
<p>energy.
</p>
<p>Thus prepared, Satan, who is always ready to offer his kmg.
</p>
<p>doms, propofed to have a kingdom in this country, the corner
</p>
<p>ilonc of which was to be a funding fyftem. This v/as quite in

<p>back-ground our revolution, (the fight of which would confound
</p>
<p>the projeflors of kingdoms) and as money lightly gained is gener-
</p>
<p>ally expended in luxury and vice, it would give a further advance ;
</p>
<p>and as the leaders would be immediately enriched, it would make
</p>
<p>them bold in projedts of wealth and magnificence.
</p>
<p>If this was not a projea of f^itan, it mufl have been of fome
</p>
<p>one, who perfedly underflood his art of making kingdoms : for
</p>
<p>it infuled a mafs of corruption into the vitals of our government,
</p>
<p>which extended to its extremities, and which will probably be
</p>
<p>produdlive of evils during every period of our national exiftence.
</p>
<p>It wasmanifefl that it would be neccffary to (juarrel with France,
</p>
<p>becaufs her revolutionary principles would be a check to us, and
</p>
<p>102
</p>
<p>by fuch quarrelling we fhould fhew a fpirit of ingraLiiude, which
</p>
<p>is a kingly attfibute. We could then infult the remains of our
</p>
<p>friends by a treaty with a nation, which had eminently flicceed-
</p>
<p>ed in a {imilar experiment under the fame aufpices : and after
</p>
<p>every thing was prepared, we could raife an army and navy ;
</p>
<p>then make laws to punilh men, who fhould deny this to be a fair,
</p>
<p>equal, chriftian government.
</p>
<p>Thofe, who deny that Satan works in the hearts of the children
</p>
<p>of difobedience, or that he has offered his temptations to thofe,
</p>
<p>who were far more holy and upright than our leaders, muft deny
</p>
<p>at once the truth of revelation. His direct addreffes are never
</p>
<p>made to the body of the people, but to the great men, who can
</p>
<p>forward his views ; he always bribes them plaufibly with wealth
</p>
<p>and honors, and promifes them, in cafe of acceptance, they (hall be
</p>
<p>as gods ; his uniform aim is to have kingdoms of his own, offi-
</p>
<p>cered by proud ecclefiaftics and ambitious ftatefmen, to corrupt
</p>
<p>the church and ruin the world. His plans are full of fubtlety,
</p>
<p>perfe6lly tempting, always practicable, and it will hardly be pre-
</p>
<p>tended that his operations here were under any reftraints of nature,
</p>
<p>grace or climate.
</p>
<p>His plan of a new kingdom here was fo full of glory for the
</p>
<p>leaders, for the old tories, for every military man, for every man
</p>
<p>anxious to be rich, that it was moft cordially embraced and moft
</p>
<p>faithfully carried into effed. The revolutionary fpirit was gone ;
</p>
<p>chriflianity trampled on ; our capital abounded in luxury, and the
</p>
<p>old foldier was bankrupt. New-England church and ftate was an
</p>
<p>old trading houfe, which readily faw the chances of gain, adopt-
</p>
<p>ed the new fyftem, and powerful meafures were concerted and
</p>
<p>effected, to add a new kingdom to the lands and tenements of the
</p>
<p>enemy of man.
</p>
<p>Men are willing to hear that Satan operated fome centuries ago,
</p>
<p>or that he is at work in other countries, or in the hearts of their

<p>neighbors ; but cannot endure to hear that he is in them and their

<p>ion over republicans, will not patiently fee him followed into their
</p>
<p>cardinal plans and even into forae of their churches : yet fuch is
</p>
<p>the courfe, which the analogies of my fubjedt demand.
</p>
<p>It is not proveable that the advocates of the funding fyftem
</p>
<p>knew under what influence they were ading. They might flatter
</p>
<p>themfelves that their ambition for wealth and honors was conliflent
</p>
<p>With the liberties of the peojJe : but charity would hardly impel
</p>
<p>us to believe that they confidered themfelves doing right, when
</p>
<p>they took from the foldier his earnings, under the falfe pretence
</p>
<p>that it was impoflible to difcrimmate between the original holder
</p>
<p>and the purchafcr. The expreffes, who rode day and night with,
</p>
<p>letters to and from members of congrefs, and the agents, who
</p>
<p>purchafed up the paper, while the funding bill was fufpended>
</p>
<p>103
</p>
<p>had raifed up arguments, which all the logic of fufferers could
</p>
<p>not confute. As all the progeny of that fyftem have been like the
</p>
<p>fire. It is unnece/Tary to trace their influences.
</p>
<p>I contend that no ordinary impreflions could have produced
</p>
<p>a ftate of things fo antichriftian, fo antirepublican as the maturity
</p>
<p>of thefe plans, under the adminiftration of Mr. Adams, prefented.
</p>
<p>The kingdom was full in view, and the fcenes of the dratjia fuc-
</p>
<p>ceeded each other fo rapidly, as even to confufe the a6i:ors : yet
</p>
<p>the names of chriftian and republican were retained, even though
</p>
<p>every meafure for their fupport was relinquifhed.
</p>
<p>As the deceiver's procefs is always to change the leading men
</p>
<p>from the charaSlers under luhich they gained injlucnce., and to conceal
</p>
<p>this change from thofe^ nvho are to he infuencsdy he contrives to
</p>
<p>retain their power after their integrity is gone. Hence the meas-
</p>
<p>ures which were called republican, pajffed as fuch among the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, till our government had afTumed the form of the Britifh gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, and a few changes of names would have made it in fadl
</p>
<p>Britifh.* This was an American kingdom in every thing but
</p>
<p>name : Republicans would endure no longer. New- England
</p>
<p>church and ftate found its energies called into adion. Thofe,
</p>
<p>who fat in the feat of Mofes joined the political clergy, and the
</p>
<p>confpiracy was embodied. The projedlis of Satan never difclofe
</p>
<p>their true characHier at once. Of the monarchical fpirit of our
</p>
<p>governtnent, there was a gradual difclofure from the firft meafure
</p>
<p>to the reign of terror, when the bitter enemies of our revolution
</p>
<p>were projecting or approving the fevereft meafures for our humilia-
</p>
<p>tion. From the firft dawnlngs of cl^urch and ftate to the perfe<5t
</p>
<p>day of confpiracy, there was a gradual difclofure. Satan had
</p>
<p>ample materials for his work in Nev/-England. Their boafted
</p>
<p>piety was the leaft of his concern. Steady habits were quite to
</p>
<p>his purpofe ; for he underftood thefe magic words to mean no more
</p>
<p>than ^^ Every 7nan to his oivn interefi.^^ He knew that the paper
</p>
<p>currency of religion was abundant among the unionifts ; but that
</p>
<p>the fpecie capital was wanting. He always knew the value of

<p>profeffions. He knew that the rich and ambitious were in a ftate
</p>
<p>of nature, and as fuch had every propenfity to his caufe : He was
</p>
<p>always fure of their aid, whenever he wirtied to eftablifh or prote<5t
</p>
<p>any of his kingdoms. He had all the paffions of this world on
</p>
<p>his fide, and nothing oppofed to him but humility and poverty,
</p>
<p>rendered more humble and poor by reafon of the long continuance
</p>
<p>of this union. 
</p>
<p>My account 'of the formation and character of this union has
</p>
<p>probably led to a perception of all that felfiftinefs, which combines
</p>
<p>itfelf in favor of the kingdoms of this world, and to a view of
</p>
<p>the paffions, which infured the aid of New-England in favor gf

</p>
<p>the new kingdom. This felfifhnefs and thefe pafTions v/ere eX
</p>
<p>prefsly called into adlon by a new paper, entitled the Palladium,
</p>
<p>in which every real motive was concealed under the following
</p>
<p>mafque of church and ftate :
</p>
<p>" Should the injidel JefFerfon be ele<f^ed to the PrefidenCy, the
</p>
<p>** feal of death is that moment fet on our holy religion : our churches
</p>
<p>** will be proflrated ; and fome infamous proftitute, under the
</p>
<p>** title of the goddefs of reafon will prefide in the fanftuaries, now
</p>
<p>* devoted to the mod high.''
</p>
<p>What can all this mean ? Are the editor of the Palladium and
</p>
<p>its clerical patrons chriflians ? Was the invisible kingdom of
</p>
<p>Chriil to have the feal of death fet on it ? No, it was the very
</p>
<p>mortal religion of church and ftate, on which the eledlion of Mr.
</p>
<p>JefFerfon would fet the feal of death. It was that profitable
</p>
<p>church, which enfured to clergymen influence without grace, and
</p>
<p>to lawyers promotion without love to their country. It was the
</p>
<p>church of our clergy-courting fenators and members of congrefs,
</p>
<p>and counfelJors. If religion is left to the nurfing care of fuch
</p>
<p>men, it could only have been fo left in order to afford a confplcuous
</p>
<p>difplay of tliat infinite power, which has promifed it an everlalling
</p>
<p>fupport. But Mr. JefFerfon is Prefident ; the gofpel of the king-*
</p>
<p>dom is fafe ; the churches are not proflrated, and reafon prefidcs
</p>
<p>in our councils without any heathenifh name or attribute ; and it
</p>
<p>is the ardent hope of republicans that a rational worfhip will be
</p>
<p>reftored to thofe churches, which have been prolKtuted to political
</p>
<p>prayers and fermons.
</p>
<p>From the federal cry about religion, a flranger might imagine
</p>
<p>that in Nev/-England every church would be fupplied with a paltor
</p>
<p> that the people v/ould freely part with their temporal goods for
</p>
<p>inftruftion in rlghteoufnefs  that focietles would be united  that
</p>
<p>few preachers would be difmiffed  that houfes of worfhip would
</p>
<p>be cron^^ed by humble, adoring federalifls, devoutly joining in

<p>the democrats were embodied under fome prince of the infernal
</p>
<p>legion, bidding defiance to the heavenly hofl, and flriving to drive
</p>
<p>the Saviour and his humble followers from their territories ; but
</p>
<p>none of thefe imaginations would be realized.  It is true that there
</p>
<p>is no want of expence in building and decorating houfes of wor-
</p>
<p>fhip : the unioniils are ambitious enough in thefe points for very
</p>
<p>obvious reafons ; but in fettlement of minifters there are frequent
</p>
<p>difputes about his theories and amount of falary. This laft is
</p>
<p>often poorly paid, and not unfrequently diminifhed. Rem.ovalsand
</p>
<p>exertions to remove are abundant. The abftrad doflrlnal preachers,
</p>
<p>who generally take the lead, are the cocleft of all cold inftruft-
</p>
<p>ors. Their federal hearers do not appear as anxious to attend
</p>
<p>v/orfhip, or as devout in it as they do in their purfuit of wealth.
</p>
<p>^Q5 ^
</p>
<p>Poikical fermons fometimes wake them to a fai callic grin at the
</p>
<p>obje<5t of the preacher's fatire, and they open their ears to hear a
</p>
<p>charadler drawn, which is to fit the candidate of an approaching
</p>
<p>eledtion ; bat in general chrillianity is Teally at a very low ebb among
</p>
<p>the (landing and privileged orders  and the democrats are individ-
</p>
<p>ually injured by the religion of church and ftate, which is wholly
</p>
<p>aimed at their rights and opinions. Not one of this clafs but
</p>
<p>would ardently wifh to be furrounded by men, fearing God and
</p>
<p>hating covetoufnefs ; men v/earing the charatfter, as well as bear-
</p>
<p>ing the name of chriilians.
</p>
<p>This ftate of religion is the caufe of the political charader of
</p>
<p>New- England- The rights of man can never thrive, where men
</p>
<p>rely on a Tyftem of wrongs for promotion : Republicanifm cannot
</p>
<p>Jive in a region of hypocrify : Ch'urch and flate unions poifon reli-
</p>
<p>gion and fociety.
</p>
<p>Do any fear to look at fuch a ftate of things, let them fefle(5t
</p>
<p>that an important ilTue depends on knowing the truth. If the;
</p>
<p>unionifis are trees of righteoufnefs, the planting of the Lord,
</p>
<p>then republicans are briars and thorns on the face of the earth ;
</p>
<p>if the unionids are faints, republicans are infidels. A ftedfaft
</p>
<p>look will fecure our objed : fear of looking at the truth has been
</p>
<p>the caufe of half the error in the world.
</p>
<p>After thefe remarks the unionifis will never fay, ^^ perhaps iht^Q
</p>
<p>repubhcans may think lightly of us -,'* they may red alTured that
</p>
<p>we are full of meaning, when we call thofe hypocrites, who have
</p>
<p>often called themfelves faints ;  when we fay that fome, who
</p>
<p>claim to be throwing fait into the fountains of fcience, have em-
</p>
<p>poifoned thofe fountains ; when they fay that fome of you, who
</p>
<p>entered within the pale of the fandluary, never took that ftep, till
</p>
<p>you had loft ail confidence ivlthout ; when they cliarge you with 
</p>
<p>trafficking in altars and ordinances. If all this feems to you like
</p>
<p>perfecution, take to yourfelves meekly the blefTednefs promifed to
</p>
<p>the perfecuted, and live the lives which enfure this bleffednefs, in
</p>

<p>not reh'gion. Your life, profeffor, muft (hew that you are govern-

<p>profeflbrs, who demand a contribution of votes' from every houfe
</p>
<p>of worfhip which they deign to vifit ?
</p>
<p>Let not founds nor words nor faces nor drefs deceive you. A
</p>
<p>little praflice will enable any man to appear gifted in prayer  to
</p>
<p>ufe folemn tones and words  to look gravely, and to drefs in black.
</p>
<p>Thefe do not all conftitute the hidden man of the heart. Habit
</p>
<p>has a great effed on molt minds ; but never carry the enthufiafm
</p>
<p>of habit as far as did a devout Catholic. " Take from us," fays
</p>
<p>he, " our crucifixes, our images, our lights, incenfe and the
</p>
<p>*' folemn exteriors of worfhip, and you deftroy our religion."
</p>
<p>Never let it be faid of your religion, that you know nothing of it,
</p>
<p>except what you can fee of it. External a(5ls are the natural ex-
</p>
<p>preflions of afFedions ; but mere external ads, not accom-
</p>
<p>panied with practices, demonftrating the exiftence and fincerity of
</p>
<p>thofe afFedions, are good for nothing : yet on the deftru6tion of
</p>
<p>thefe externals have your alarms been falfely excited by political
</p>
<p>religionifts. They have faid, that your meeting-houfes and bibles
</p>
<p>would be burnt ; but if the deftrudtion of places, where they
</p>
<p>might difpofe of their marketable religion would ruin them, be it
</p>
<p>your confolation that nothing can deftroy chriftianity. It ftands
</p>
<p>on the rock of ages.

<p>to the inftitutions of God, be not offended that men obferve them ;
</p>
<p>but if they avail themfelves of fuch obfervances to infult you,
</p>
<p>fet this down as an evidence of their hypocrify and facrilege.
</p>
<p>Pure and undefiled religion deferves your praftice, homage and
</p>
<p>refpe<a j but hypocrify and double-dealing defej ve your abhorrence.
</p>
<p>If you have any prefent wifh for public confidence, reprefs it ;
</p>
<p>for the moft perfect charader for pure chriftianity will not bring
</p>
<p>you nearer to it than the moft open infidelity. Thefe church and
</p>
<p>ftate dealers will never promote you, unlefs you turn your religion
</p>
<p>into their ftock. That righteoufnefs which flows not out in votes
</p>
<p>is not to their purpofe. You will furvive tliis ftate of things.
</p>
<p>That fpirit of toleration, which is pervading our country will de-
</p>
<p>ftroy all privileged orders. Young, ambitious infidels, who have
</p>
<p>.io8
</p>
<p>lately joined church and Trate, in profped of the temporal glory
</p>
<p>to be revealed, \vili be afronirned at the overwhelming of the
</p>
<p>Tjnionifts ; and whenever this crifis (hall arrive, die great cry of
</p>
<p>the fhip-wrecked adventurers will be, that chriftianity is ruined
</p>
<p>forever. This is precifely the cry, which every impoftor, fince
</p>
<p>the days of the Saviour, has ufed, when his impiety was deleted.
</p>
<p>Till the moment of dete(J^ion he contents himfelf with crying,
</p>
<p>*' the church is in danger of ruin." Thefe two exclamations,
</p>
<p>neither of which was ever ufed by a true chriftian, and neither
</p>
<p>of which is or -ever was true, will defignate the artful, deceitful
</p>
<p>hypocrites, who, after robbing men of their rights expire with a
</p>
<p>lie in their right hands.
</p>
<p>If chriftianity needs the (iipport of civil Inftitmions, it has not
</p>
<p>come from God. If the head of the church delights to proteft
</p>
<p>it, he will not lofe that delight for the political promotion of our
</p>
<p>ofHcers of government. The men, who are conflantly crying^
</p>
<p>" w are pious, we are holy, chriftianity depends on us, our polit-
</p>
<p>ical opponents are vile, wicked and depraved,'* are the hft men
</p>
<p>to be entrufted wi|[\ the defence of a religion, in which he, who
</p>
<p>thought moft humbly of himfelf, was to be the greateft in the
</p>
<p>kingdom of heaven.
</p>
<p>If you have the leaft propenfity ftill to adhere to thefe men,
</p>
<p>recollca: that the fame propenfity in the Jews to refpea a clafs of
</p>
<p>men, juft like your leaders, brought your Saviour to the crofs j
</p>
<p>that a mifguided zeal delayed for centuries the reformation ; that
</p>
<p>impofture is flow in letting go its hold of its fubjeds, and that if
</p>
<p>you wifti for religious iind civil liberty, you mivft make one fpirited
</p>
<p>effort. What though the ecclefiaftical and poHtical affociates of
</p>
<p>ihis church and ftate union be povv^erful in talents ; and fuftained
</p>
<p>by their deceived followers, appear as a mighty foreft, yet rejoice
</p>
<p>in this,
</p>
<p>** That an axe is laid unto the root of the trees, and that every

<p>Had the members of this union contented themfelves with the
</p>
<p>ordinary profits of hypocrify, they might have been unnoticed ;
</p>
<p>but when our rights are attacked ; when the country, in which we
</p>
<p>are to fpend a part of our being, is to be gradually fubjugated, as
</p>
<p>others have been, it becomes our duty to drag the monfter of hy-
</p>
<p>pocrify however ferocious, into open day, and to rifque prefent
</p>
<p>cafe and fafety for the certain benefit of expofmg him in all his de-

<p>Tsnion and to pray them for the fake of religion and the good of

<p>man to defi{t would anfwer no purpofe. A war of opinions muft
</p>
<p>be raifed againft them : you muft take from them the public confi-
</p>
<p>dence and the public honors. No man ought to regard this fubjed):
</p>
<p>With indifference j or to ftay his hand, becaufe the friends c^
</p>
<p>109
</p>
<p>church and flate cry let us alone. This is the cry of the incautious
</p>
<p>patient whofe wound unlefs faithfully probed will coft his life.
</p>
<p>Rdigion is in a miferable condition in New-England, worfe than
</p>
<p>in parts where there is lefs fhew of it. You fee few of its energies,
</p>
<p>except in political llorms, and this ftate of things is produced by
</p>
<p>its worft enemies, in the garb of its beft friends ; and their wick-
</p>
<p>ednefs is aggravated by their attempts to charge this ftate of things,
</p>
<p>on that very clafs of men, whofe ruin is attempted to be compafT-
</p>
<p>ed by it. Detach politics, offices, applaufe and honors from New-
</p>
<p>England religion ! then fee what would remain of it : jfujl as
</p>
<p>much true religion; but very little of external fhow and profelHon.
</p>
<p>In opening this fubjeifl I purpofely burft through the exteriors
</p>
<p>and led you at once to the real charader of thefe men  and ftript
</p>
<p>of exteriors, let me afk you, do the clerical politicians appear to
</p>
<p>be ambaffadors of Chrift, or do the political fanatics appear as
</p>
<p>the followers of the lamb? You know well that neither are true
</p>
<p>chriftians in deed and in truth. Are you then paid for this ftate of
</p>
<p>hypocrify by the afcendency, which is thereby gained over our
</p>
<p>I'outhern brethren,  by the unity of aftion, which it gives to the
</p>
<p>underlabourers  or by any profpeft of profit, which you expe<5l
</p>
<p>hereafter to gain by it ? If you are willing to barter yoWr rights in
</p>
<p>this v/orld and your chance for heaven on fuch miferable exchan-
</p>
<p>ges, you alone will be the fufferers.
</p>
<p>The zeal to advance this church and ftate union difclofed itfelf
</p>
<p>early under our prefent government. Our iirft prefident was forced
</p>
<p>to yield to it. The fecond was one of its nurfmg fathers.
</p>
<p>When the third was advancing they faw in him a firm unbending
</p>
<p>man, who believed in toleration, and abhorred the interpofition of
</p>
<p>ecclefiaftical power in political concerns. You faw the vengeance,
</p>
<p>with which he was attacked from federal pulpits and prefles.
</p>
<p>Every falfe, bitter and malicious crimination ilTued againft him from

<p>the aftbciated members  republicans were reprcfented as in alliance

<p>gious liberty. Every word in our language, which exprefles any
</p>
<p>portion of rights, was ridiculed by the unionifts. They could not
</p>
<p>even conceal their love for royalty, and their diftrefs when vidory
</p>
<p>crowned the republican arms. They did conceal their love of
</p>
<p>papal dominion till his holinefs was driven from the Vatican  then
</p>
<p>their prayers for his downfall ceafed, and their tears of commifer-
</p>
<p>ation burft forth. New-England was awfully prepared for the
</p>
<p>reign of terror in 1798, and for a number of pubUc meafures,
</p>
<p>which will be remembered by republicans, only as an evidence,
</p>
<p>how depraved men will become, whe^n they are not reftrained by
</p>
<p>fear of God or man. Monarchiits have been careffed here,

<p>days, when a dark cloud threatened to overfpvead the morning of

<p>our national exiftence. See with what rage thefe men retain all
</p>
<p>the power, which they can hold ; how they avenge the removal of"
</p>
<p>their adherents ; how they decry and oppofe the will of the nation,
</p>
<p>how they even threaten their fouthern brethren  talk of civil war
</p>
<p>and difmemberment, and all this in the name of order, which they
</p>
<p>defpife, and of Jefus, whofe caufe they have wounded.
</p>
<p>The zeal in one clafs of men to have dominion over the reft has
</p>
<p>appeared in every country. It is infeparable from the hearts of
</p>
<p>proud men. Thofe, who feek this dominion will always deny it.
</p>
<p>Call them monarchifts or hierarchs, they difclaim your terms ;
</p>
<p>but in every nation, where there are men, this fpirit walks in dark-
</p>
<p>nefs as a peftilence  and though its operations are fubtle, yet in
</p>
<p>every country you may as furely find its origin in an union of
</p>
<p>church and ftate, as you may trace vegetation to the earth.
</p>
<p>Caft your eyes through the country and difcern by the true light,
</p>
<p>whether my views are corre<5l:. Do you fee any violently inveigh-
</p>
<p>ing againft infidels and infidelity ? Such have never been in tlie
</p>
<p>way with Jefus, for he wept even over Jerufalem, the citadel of
</p>
<p>his enemies, and would have gathered its inhabitants, as a hen
</p>
<p>gathereth her chickens under her wings ; he ate with publicans and
</p>
<p>finners, and on his crofs prayed for his enemies.  Do any talk
</p>
<p>loudly about their own holinefs, virtue and piety ? So did the
</p>
<p>Fharifees : But Paul, in humility, faid " I am not meet to be an
</p>
<p>apoftle.'* Do preachers become bufy-bodles in political concerns ?
</p>
<p>Butthe Saviour's diredion was, ** Go preach the gofpel." Are
</p>
<p>any working, with over-heated zeal, in church concerns, and
</p>
<p>driving to humble their chriftian brethren ? But the Saviour direiSl-
</p>
<p>ed that he, who was without fin, fhould throw the firft ftone, let

<p>enquiries you will find that now, as formerly, the proud and

<p>boafting, the elevated and confpicuous feekers of power have no

<p>with a little, laboring hard to fupport a clafs of men, who are

<p>for the blood of the flain, as if they confidered the books of rec-
</p>
<p>ord to be forever clofed, and as if a feafon would never arrive,
</p>
<p>when the fea would give up its dead. They enter peaceable fami-
</p>
<p>lies and drag their hopes into the field ; defolate villages and deftroy
</p>
<p>their thoufands, and when vengeance fays it is enough, they pray
</p>
<p>that fwords may be turned into ploughfhares and fpears into pruning-
</p>
<p>hooks, and that nations may learn war no more. The war ferves
</p>
<p>as an apology for an Increafe of taxation, and having before taxed
</p>
<p>all which the labor of man produces, they tax the light which
</p>
<p>heaven beftows, and if difcontent arifes by reafon of oppreifion,
</p>
<p>another war ia declared in order to hufh the tumult.
</p>
<p>Thus wars are excited under pretence of ferving the kingdom
</p>
<p>of peace, and all the rights of mankind are violated under a pre-
</p>
<p>tence of advancing thofe rights. Everything has always been in
</p>
<p>danger ; thefe men have affedled to avert the danger, and the
</p>
<p>ftate of things has, under their management, been always growing

<p>woiTe : yet thefe pilots, who are always fteerlng among the rocks,
</p>
<p>are ftill at helm, and multitudes of liftlefs men, whofe all is at

<p>flake, fay, " let the fhip fink, we are only paffengers"  and this

<p>ftupid confidence is among the ^^Jleady habitSy^ which receive the

</p>
<p>Such is the hiftory of the world  on the one hand an eafy,

<p>unfufpicious confidence, and on the other a bold and daring af-

</p>
<p>government, againft which I claim that the unionifts have confpir-
</p>
<p>ed, is intended the government for which our revolution was
</p>
<p>effeded ; not that republic, whioh under Mr. Adams, meant
</p>
<p>any thing or nothing ; nor any particular fet of men, compofing
</p>
<p>an adminiftration ; but that pjl'iiical fyjlem, ivhich has been alivays
</p>
<p>denominated republican.  By the conlpiracy charged is intended
</p>
<p>that portion and kind of enmity a^ainft fuch a government, (arif-
</p>
<p>ing from tlie fame motives, and conduced by as infidious means)
</p>
<p>which animated the court of St. James and the Britifh army to
</p>
<p>coufpire againft our independence.
</p>
<p>My charge will be occafionally illuftrated by brief references to
</p>
<p>meafures ; but my principal reliance will be on the operations of
</p>
<p>n^urc and the fyftem of paffions, which have always fudained the
</p>
<p>"3
</p>
<p>moni{ls of former ages. I difclaim all middle ground between
</p>
<p>the parties ; they are on different fyilems, variant as the charadlers,
</p>
<p>which have been defcribed, and a yielding of each, fo as to har-
</p>
<p>monize in meafures, would be as great a violence to nature and to
</p>
<p>their beings as for the two poles to meet on the equator.
</p>
<p>Conciliation is the darling theme of federalids ; conciliation
</p>
<p>refponds every neutral man, and fome republicans are pleafed with
</p>
<p>a calculation that the eminent fed^ralifts are lowering their tone,
</p>
<p>and will foon lead all the reft into our fyftem. It is extremely
</p>
<p>popular to fay, " Both pai ties are honeft ; we are both feeking
</p>
<p>the beft good of the country, hut happen to differ in the means :"
</p>
<p>But what is meant by this ? Is any man hardy enough to charge
</p>
<p>both parties in the country with hypocrify and the bafeft of falfe-
</p>
<p>hoods ? Has nothing been intended by the collifions of party for
</p>
<p>feveral years ? Did the republicans mean nothing when they charg-
</p>
<p>ed the fedcralifts with tendencies to monarchy ? Did federaiifts
</p>
<p>mean nothing when they charged us with tendencies to anarchy^
</p>
<p>Have the violent difputes in our newfpapers and in our congrefs
</p>
<p>been about nothing ? And did each regard the other as honeft men,
</p>
<p>anxious for the beft good of the country ? Was the reign of terror
</p>
<p>in 1798 excited for o/^^i/2^ /* Have republicans been imprifoned
</p>
<p>for nothing ? Were the Britifli treaty and the maritime war with
</p>
<p>France, and the alien and fedition a6ls, and the new army all foi
</p>
<p>nothing ? Was the oppofition to Mr. JefFerfon's eledion for nothing ?
</p>
<p>Really if federalifts meant nothing by all this, we fincerely wifh
</p>
<p>that they had done nothing : and if republicans really meafii
</p>
<p>nothing by all their prefent meafures, it is beft to look into Mr.
</p>
<p>Adams' fample of balanced governments, and as foon as we find
</p>
<p>one, which appears to be the moft ftupenduous fabric of human
</p>
<p>invention, it will be beft to adopt it, and to place fome one at the
</p>
<p>helm of it, who will be/z/// of meaning m all his meafures.
</p>
<p>Great premiums are offered in the papers for any man, who
</p>

<p>repubiican States (hall yield to three federal States, and acknowl-
</p>
<p>edge themfelves wrong in all their oppofition to federal meafures ?
</p>
<p>Will they reftore the favorite meafures of the laft adminiftration ?
</p>
<p>And will they acknowledge, that their principles led to anarchy,
</p>
<p>and to confpiracy againft all religion and all government ?
</p>
<p>I fee no middle ground, where the parties can meet without
</p>
<p>loling their political exiftence. If no principle diflinguiihed
</p>
<p>them, and the only conteft was about words, both are too deftitute
</p>
<p>of integrity ever to truft or be trufted.
</p>
<p>The greateft zealots for conciliation are generally a clafs of men,
</p>
<p>who would not yield a fmgle point of opinion to be at peace with
</p>
<p>the whole world. All nature muft bend to them and they will
</p>
<p>be conciliated. There is a fmall number of our unionifts, who,
</p>
<p>though they feel all this impreflion, yet have the addrefs to win,
</p>
<p>by iTifinuating manners and fmooth language-, the people into a pcr-
</p>
<p>fuafion that they would yield and facrifice every thing to harmony
</p>
<p>and the federal union : but if you pufh thefe men a little beyond
</p>
<p>their fpeed on any cardinal point, they will (hew that they are
</p>
<p>among our moft dangerous enemies. They betray with a kifs -
</p>
<p>I like no fuch blandifhments. Republicanifm can never thrive by
</p>
<p>acceffions of men, merely dKTatisfied with a few meafures, nor
</p>
<p>by acceflions of doubtful men, nor by men afFefting to yield up
</p>
<p>their federal principles on motives of conciliation. It muft
</p>
<p>reft on its own bafis and depend for force on this fa6t, that the body
</p>
<p>of mankind in every country are radically republicans , and that they
</p>
<p>nvill ahuays aB as fuch, nvhenever they are redeemed from the terror
</p>
<p>or impojlureSf nvith ivhich the unionifls have invefled them.
</p>
<p>If it be true that republicans are confpiiing againft all govern-
</p>
<p>ment  or if the federal leaders are confpirlng againft our govern-
</p>
<p>ment, the idea of conciliation is out of the queftlon, until one
</p>
<p>party (hall come forward and avow that they have been purfulng,
</p>
<p>with the worft of nations, the worft of ends.

<p>But the obje6l to be gained by conciliation is an incorporation
</p>
<p>of 3- 1 6th of federalifm with 1 3-1 6th of republicanifm, and with
</p>
<p>fuch a difcordant mixture all is to be right, and there are to be no

<p>more parties ! Can any man calculate that there will ever be more

<p>unanimity in the country than there now is ? The federalifts roar
</p>
<p>like lions and fay that there is great confufion ; but can we expedl
</p>
<p>that more than 1 3-1 6th of the United States will be in favor of
</p>
<p>any adminiftration ? Unanimity is gained as far as could have been
</p>
<p>expeded ; but a coDciliation with men, who employ daily their
</p>
<p>tongues, pens and fer vices to promote diffention ; to vilify the

<p>after burning our towns and flaughtering our brethren, had no other

<p>arguments to offer for our forgivnefs, but the finenefs of her cloths
</p>
<p>and the generofity of her credit, and yt thefe were accepted by
</p>
<p>our leaders, it was a cheap way of fettling for blood. There is
</p>
<p>much of diplomatic dignity in fuch work ; but what is the confe-
</p>
<p>quence to the world ? Difmal wars and commercial treaties at the
</p>
<p>end of them ! The common people blieed by thoufands, and their
</p>
<p>leaders clofe the account by a treaty. If the m^aking of offenfive

<p>lution, and during this period the whole of the human character
</p>
<p>had difcovered itfelf, and fome of our felf-Jl'iled holy men, and
</p>
<p>many of omv felf-Jllkd federal civilians had performed the routine
</p>
<p>of all their artifices upon a well-difpofed people. We will
</p>
<p>take a view of the unionifts from each noticeable point of the above
</p>
<p>period. In my feventh number of the firft part, it was remarked
</p>
<p>that church and (late was once m a fmail w^y of traffic. This
</p>
<p>ii6
</p>
<p>was the cafe at the opening of our revolution. Their little arts had
</p>
<p>been played over and over again, without affording much profit or
</p>
<p>amufement. The idea of going to heaven or leading others there
</p>
<p>without taking a good portion of this world on the road never
</p>
<p>occurred to our unionifts. Had Britain offered them as much of
</p>
<p>wealth and honors as they could calculate to gain by a revolu-
</p>
<p>tion, our weapons of war would have continued to be inftruments
</p>
<p>of hufbandry and we fbouldhave been under the moderate domina-
</p>
<p>tion of maflers abroad, inftead of having been under the fevere
</p>
<p>dcminion of our own brethren. The unionifts pourtrayed in
</p>
<p>glowing colors the intolerance, irreligion and tyranny of the
</p>
<p>Britiili  the public temper was excited ; yet the burdens com-
</p>
<p>plained of were laid on by a legitimate government, which pro-
</p>
<p>te<51:ed us, and they bore no proportion in point of weight to thofe
</p>
<p>which we fince endured ; but liberty of confcience was to be gain-
</p>
<p>ed and poHtical liberty and a thoufand other blefTmgs, which have
</p>
<p>only lived in political fermons and fongs. The events of the war
</p>
<p>were various, and the unionifts were forward enough in praying and
</p>
<p>in giving words of command, and the people who were to be eleva-
</p>
<p>ted to the rank of freemen were brave enough in fighting.
</p>
<p>Had the unionifts told our army at the northward, " In a few
</p>
<p>years you will have new ftamp-afts and excife," Burgoyne might
</p>
<p>have marched with 5000 men through the country. Had they
</p>
<p>faid to our brave army at the Ciege of York-Town, " In a few
</p>
<p>years ftockjobbers will be rioting on the fruits of your labors," the
</p>
<p>fiege would have been raifed, and Cornwallis might have taken
</p>
<p>pofTeffion of the country. Had the country anticipated a treaty
</p>
<p>with Britain, a quarrel with France or the diplomatic mafquerade
</p>
<p>of 1798, they would have laid down their arms  or had one of
</p>
<p>the numerous exprefles, who rode the country with tidings to an
</p>
<p>anxious people, have fald, " In a few years, men, who publicly
</p>
<p>deride the very term of republicanifm, and who treat with adhor-

<p>fuch an exprefs might have fought him and not a hair of his head

</p>
<p>G-odwin (the waiters of our great men) conceive not of the ardors
</p>
<p>of that day, when the inhabitants of an extended country refolved

<p>on freedom or death ; nor do they conceive of the inteMigent
</p>
<p>force v/ith which fijch ardors will be diredled againft thofe, who
</p>
<p>have put their machinery in motion.
</p>
<p>During our revolution, church and date' did not fieep ; all its
</p>
<p>paffio^ns were operating for future advantage : little indeed did it
</p>
<p>dream of Zion or of the liberties of mankind. Church and ftate
</p>
<p>emboforaed atthat Aioment all thofc propenfities, which impeded
</p>
<p>^ 5_|2
</p>
<p>the conpletion of our revolution, and produced all our political
</p>
<p>diflenfions, and from the known and vifibie members of it they
</p>
<p>have all proceeded.
</p>
<p>At the peace of 1783 we had completed the firfl point of our
</p>
<p>revolution, viz an eftablifhment of our independence, and at
</p>
<p>this moment it was natural to refle<5l on the advantages, which, as
</p>
<p>a nation, we might derive from it. We were far diilant from the
</p>
<p>kingdoms of Europe, thofe theatres, where religion and humani-
</p>
<p>ty had been always outraged by civil and ecclefiaftical tyrants ;
</p>
<p>thofe theatres, where the common people had been made to ad
</p>
<p>the part of beads of burden, where ribbons were efteeraed more
</p>
<p>than lives, where men were boa/ling of their pedigree, where
</p>
<p>rank depended on birth, and where heaven v/as baniihed from
</p>
<p>earth, as much as the depravity of man could banifli it. We were
</p>
<p>redeemed from crowns and the pageants who wear them, and had
</p>
<p> an extended country, to which we might invite the oppreffed of
</p>
<p>the old world. I'his was a feafon of enthufiafm, and (as the
</p>
<p>event has proved) of ftrong illuiions. Man is never more ennobled
</p>
<p>than when, reilciHing on his virtuous ilruggles, he refoives that
</p>
<p>the world fhall enjoy the benefit of them, and is never in greater
</p>
<p>danger of difappointment, than when he entrufts the execution of
</p>
<p>his benevolent projedls to thcfe, who defpife his motives.
</p>
<p>In the feafon which we are contemplating, much was faid of
</p>
<p>the majejiy of the people y a fet of terms, which the unionifts then
</p>
<p>defpifed, and which one of their number (a clergyman) lately
</p>
<p>termed, the majefty of the mob ;  but in thofe days it was under-
</p>
<p>itood that the people, who had gained all the power, who did all
</p>
<p>the labor, and on whom would depend the whole fupport of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, ftiould, in their corporate capacity, be regarded with
</p>
<p>refpeft. They never conceived in that day that a being of their
</p>
<p>own creation* Ihould talk of " humbling them in duft and afiles''
</p>
<p>that little beings of their creation f fhould vote away their
</p>
<p>money by millions, contrary to their known mind and will, and
</p>
<p>call it " a trifle"  that beings of their creation fhould, without

<p>any reference to them, draw them into alliance with all the aban-
</p>
<p>donment againfl which they had been fighting for years  :that the
</p>
<p>aliens, whom they had invited, fliould be baniflied, and that they'
</p>
<p>Ihould be imprifoned for queftioning the propriety of fuch condud.
</p>
<p>Nor did they conceive that their reprefentatives, after pofitively
</p>
<p>knowing their choice of a Prelident, fhould under the foleninity
</p>
<p>of an oath, deprive themfelves of fleep, in order to counterad the
</p>
<p>people, and prevent a fair experiment of their government. Had the
</p>
<p>people conceived the pofHbility of fuch things, they would have
</p>
<p>fettled their powers before they laid down their arms. The
</p>
<p>anionifls had gained their great point in gaining the power o5

</p>
<p>government on this fide of the water, and as they had been the
</p>
<p>leaders, they led the people no further.
</p>
<p>Had a government been formed at this feafon, it would have
</p>
<p>involved all the principles of the revolution  no tory nor monarch-
</p>
<p>id would have had a feat in the convention  no plan of a limited
</p>
<p>monarchy would have been brought forward  no provifion would
</p>
<p>have been made for diplomadc agencies no great national plans
</p>
<p>provided for ; but the ftates being fecured in their feparate fove-
</p>
<p>reignties, the general concerns would have been left in a general
</p>
<p>depofuory. It is impoilible to decide what form it would have
</p>
<p>a/Tumed, it is enough that it would have been the iegitiniate child
</p>
<p>of its parent. How would a legiflature, fitting at that time, have
</p>
<p>fucceeded in eftablilhing a funding fyftem, to deprive the foldier,
</p>
<p>whofe wound was yet bleeding, of his hard earnt commutation ?
</p>
<p>How would the propofal of a Britifh treaty have been received ?
</p>
<p>Our unionifts well knew that the ardors of the revolution muft
</p>
<p>abate, before they could advance with their fyftems. The pre-
</p>
<p>tence that the country v/as not prepared for a regular government
</p>
<p>is idle : they were prepared for peace, for order, for economy,
</p>
<p>for political equality, for toleration, and for fupport of an ad-
</p>
<p>minidration, which was ferioufly in favor of fuch a government ;
</p>
<p>but they were not prepared to facrifice at a llroke the fruits of
</p>
<p>a revolution. They were not prepared to bid an eternal adieu to
</p>
<p>the hopes, which had fuftained them through an eight years
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>The people, whom the federal leaders have fince called and
</p>
<p>treated as a miferable rabble, who needed a corps of judges to
</p>
<p>fave them from their word: enemies, themfehes, were then their own
</p>
<p>beft friends. The revolution had given a keennefs to their per-
</p>
<p>ceptions : they faw the arts, by which foreign courts held in fub-
</p>
<p>jeftion their people, and they had no calculations but of lofs by
</p>
<p>any great plans which might be led up here. They did not

<p>article of this greatnefs more than his dividend of it is worth. Can

</p>
<p>Had our declaration of independence exprefled our zeal for fuch
</p>
<p>2 courfe, the war would have been indantly at an end. But in
</p>
<p>tip
</p>
<p>the midft of all thefe great plans, in what o-bfcure corner of the
</p>
<p>country is the religion of us common people to be marfed ? Surely
</p>
<p>not in our hearts^ if we approve fuch meafures ; and as furely cur
</p>
<p>clergy are not to nurfe it, if they pray for men, who advance
</p>
<p>fuch meafures. Why were we placed fo diftant from Europe, if
</p>
<p>by treaties we are to ftretch our arms acrofs the Atlantic, and to
</p>
<p>embrace her courts and her vices ?
</p>
<p>At the feafon which we contemplate, our people knew all thefe
</p>
<p>things, and the imprejdions of the people were known to the lead-
</p>
<p>ers J but -.heir's was a courfe of national glory, and the feafon had
</p>
<p>not arrived for laying the foundation of it. If a pure republic
</p>
<p>is ever eftabliflied, it muft be at a time, when the public mind is
</p>
<p>not corrupted ; when it has virtue enough to facrifice the tempting
</p>
<p>baubles of prefent fplendor to the fubftantial intereft of the pref^
</p>
<p>ent and future generations. The principle of virtue may be gen-
</p>
<p>erated in a (ingle mind by reafon of refleftion ; but public virtue
</p>
<p>refults from fome occafion powerful enough to overwhelm the
</p>
<p>pallions, and this virtue will abate, as it advances from its pro-
</p>
<p>ducing caufe. To the revolutionary eye of the people, it was
</p>
<p>clear that to a nation the avoidance of evil communications, the
</p>
<p>habits of economy, peace and humanity, with moderate wifhes,
</p>
<p>were as necelTary as to an individual : that the plans of monarchs
</p>
<p>and the principles of republicanifm could not coincide, and that
</p>
<p>any attempt to enjoy the bleflings of the laft, under the aufpices
</p>
<p>of the firft, muft be unfuccefsful.
</p>
<p>The unionifts well knew that the public memory foon fails ;
</p>
<p>that public paflion, when ceafed to be blown, foon expires, and
</p>
<p>that a few years would change the afped, and therefore delayed to
</p>
<p>come forward with the great plans, which were to annihilate the
</p>
<p>principles of the revolution ; to domefticate the power vv^hich we
</p>
<p>had acquired j to reduce the people to the European ftandard of
</p>
<p>dependence, and to elevate thsmfelves above ail contrc^, except
</p>
<p>the nominal power of elections, in which their management was
</p>
<p>to deprive the people of vohtion and choice.

<p>In this connexion you will not fail to fee the line, which dif-
</p>
<p>tingulfhes between the interefts of the common people and thofe of
</p>
<p>their leaders  the advantages, which thefe laft may take of the
</p>
<p>firft  and the cautious manner in which the unionifts watched
</p>
<p>the relapfe of public ardor in order to compafs their ends. The

</p>
<p>Htftory of the Ccnfpiracy of the Unknijls, continued.
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>N my laft number I have fpoken freely of the unionlfts,
</p>
<p>as having interefts diftin(ft from the body of *the people. For
</p>
<p>this I might rely on former explanations ; but it may be well to
</p>
<p>notice definitely this diftinftion of interefts, becaufe it forms the
</p>
<p>bafis of this confpiracy.
</p>
<p>It will not be pretended that the union of church and ftate, as
</p>
<p>it exifted when our revolution commenced, could have any fyftem-
</p>
<p>atic calculation oi fpecifc benefits, or that every member of them
</p>
<p>contemplated individual intereft ; but nature will adt itfelf. The
</p>
<p>young lion roars after his prey, even before he knows what branch
</p>
<p>of bufinefs he is to follow, and before he has ftrength enough to
</p>
<p>fecure his prey, if it was in his reach. We have multitudes of
</p>
<p>young union ifts, who roar about religion and fteady habits^ and
</p>
<p>jacobinifm and anarchy, who have no ideas attached to their
</p>
<p>words. They make a great noife about national ftrength and
</p>
<p>the maral force of fedsraltfm. They have learnt thefe notes from
</p>
<p>fome one, and they ferve as difcordant expreffions offome inward
</p>
<p>feelings. They have no meaning in all this, except that they
</p>
<p>intend to gain advantage of mankind, as others have done before
</p>
<p>them, and that when they gain their ftrength they will do their
</p>
<p>portion of mifchief.  Some men are born with greater conceptions
</p>
<p>of themfelves than others ; they conceive themfelves to poiTefs
</p>
<p>fuperior mental or perfonal accomplifhments, which entitle them
</p>

</p>
<p>its furface.
</p>
<p>This was a revolutionary fentiment and by it was intended that
</p>
<p>political equality^ ixjh'ich balancci many of the artifcial and unavoid^
</p>
<p>able eneqitaltt'ies of Ife. Imperceptible as may be the point of dif-
</p>
<p>tindtion to be taken on this fentiment ; yet at this point the friends
</p>
<p>and enemies of our revolution took their departure from each'
</p>
<p>other. The people did not contend that the man, who was pof-
</p>
<p>felTed of an ample property, ftiould dirlde it ejjualiy with one
</p>
<p>121
</p>
<p>who had none, nor that all men were born equal in natural capaci-
</p>
<p>ty, or that their acquired knowledge had been equal, or that there
</p>
<p>was or ought to be an equality of ftature or ftrength. The ftiipid
</p>
<p>ideas of kvelifm imputed to them never exifted : but they had no
</p>
<p>refpe6l to birch nor noble blood, nor profeffional claims to homage.
</p>
<p>They regarded every man, who v/as born, as having a right to
</p>
<p>exift among others, who were born, and if any man v/as wifer
</p>
<p>than the reiF, they allowed him all the advantages, which he could
</p>
<p>fairly reap from his wifdom. They believed that every man, who
</p>
<p>was taxed, had a right to a vote, and that life and liberty were
</p>
<p>qualifications preferable to property, and that the laft was not
</p>
<p>evidence of fuperlor merit or claims. Thefe fentiments not only
</p>
<p>deflroyed artificial diftincftions, v;hich had no foundation, but
</p>
<p>they opened the way to greater freedom of thinking and judging,
</p>
<p>both of men and fubje<5ls. Before this one cJafs of the unionilts
</p>
<p>had held by immemorial ufe the right of thinking for the people
</p>
<p>on religious fubjects, and another clafs of thinking for the people
</p>
<p>on political and legal fubjeds, and each clafs of eftimating its own
</p>
<p>weight in the fcale of beings. Nov/ if thefe weights were to be
</p>
<p>thrown into other fcales and the people were to hold the balance,
</p>
<p>it might produce too m.uch revolution. The new order of things
</p>
<p>was not relilhed by the unionifts ; but we were in the midft of
</p>
<p>a revolution, and it was 'no feafon for difcuffion. Will any man
</p>
<p>believe that the pride of fuperiority, which was confpicuous
</p>
<p>enough in New-England before our revolution, and which now
</p>
<p>exifts in great force, had at that time refoived itfelf into perfeft
</p>
<p>humility  that the paffions had become pafiive, and that our cler-
</p>
<p>ical and civil unioniils ever contemplated being reduced to a fingie
</p>
<p>fiiare in a divifion of political rights ? Or to be on a political
</p>
<p>level with the people ? It is as incredible as that rivers will afcend
</p>
<p>the mountains. What would have been to them the confequence,
</p>
<p>if the revolutionary fpirit had gained a rational effect ? Or indeed
</p>
<p>how have they received that portion of fuch effects, which has

<p>all fophifra, and on the face of it fo rational that it would feem as if

</p>
<p>fed the body of the people in every age, and the bload of millions
</p>
<p>has been (bed in conteft about it. When the curfe was pronounced
</p>
<p>on Adam that the earth fhould bring forth ttiiflles and thorns, and
</p>
<p>that in the fweat of his face he fliould eat his bread, he doubtiefs
</p>
<p>confidered it a hard cafe ; but his was a blelTed condition, compared
</p>
<p>with that of millions of his pofterity, who in the fweat of rheir
</p>
<p>faces have been obliged to gain bread for others to eat : they have
</p>
<p>fown that others might reap, and their wine and their oil have made
</p>
<p>the hearts of others glad, and the faces of others to Ihine, while
</p>
<p>they have been left to hunger, fadnefs and defpair.
</p>
<p>Early and mod ferioufly did the enemies of the common people,
</p>
<p>(whom heaven has in wrath fent abundantly iRto every nation) .
</p>
<p>undertake to contend that he^ <wko earned bread, Jhould not eat it,
</p>
<p>and at the opening of our revolution they had completely gained
</p>
<p>their point in every nation of Europe. The common people had
</p>
<p>indeed the crumbs, which fell from their mailer's tables and paid
</p>
<p>moil: feverely for the indulgence. The original curfe had defcen-
</p>
<p>ded exclufiveiy on the common people and no part of it reached
</p>
<p>their lords. Thefe took the bread and left the thiftles and thorns
</p>
<p>to the laborers, and had even formed fyflems, on which they reft-
</p>
<p>ed the righteoufnefs of this diitribution. The body of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, which term includes 9-ioths of them, originally polTeffedthe
</p>
<p>foil as tenants of the great Proprietor, and with a knowledge of
</p>
<p>their rights might have kept thefe lords under fuch allowances of
</p>
<p>bread, as would have tamed their natural imperioufnefs ; but
</p>
<p>through various caufes thefe lords claimed the foil, either in virtue
</p>
<p>of conquefl: or artifice, or becaufe they had the honor to delcend
</p>
<p>from, an illullrious race of anceftors, who owed their firft glory to
</p>
<p>the extent of impofitions, which they had pradifed on mankind.
</p>
<p>Thefe lords gave portions of the people's bread to fuch of their
</p>
<p>number as would join them in arms, and thus completed by force,
</p>
<p>vvhiit had been begun in fraud, and the glorious fyflem of feudal
</p>
<p>tenures was a declaration of the rights of the lords in confequence
</p>
<p>of a boundlefs fylkm of wrongs.

<p>The body of mankind once humbled and difarmed, lofe their
</p>
<p>r.atural force, forget that tliey were made but a little lower than
</p>
<p>the angels, take their rank among the brutes, and afTume that very
</p>
<p>atthude that gives keennefs to the contempt, which their mafters
</p>
<p>feel for them. After fuch premifes we are not to wonder at the
</p>
<p>(late of oppreffion in Europe  at the vaft power, wealth and mag-
</p>
<p>nificence of their kings, princes and hierarchs, nor at the readi-
</p>
<p>nefs with which thefe obfequious flaves look up to the will and plea-
</p>
<p>fure of their mailers. What ambitious men would join luch a
</p>
<p>fervile, contemptible grou|) ? Who would advocate the rights of
</p>
<p>thofe, who had no fpirit to affert their rights and who would foon-
</p>
<p>er join an army, whofe objed was their own total humiliation,
</p>
<p>than to join a band of men refolved on death or liberty ? Who
</p>
<p>I2Q
</p>
<p>would plead for men, who would reply the arguments of their maf-
</p>
<p>ters ? When man fmks below his being, he fmks lower than any
</p>
<p>other animal. A man, born free and who tamely fubmits to flave-
</p>
<p>ry, is unfpeakably contemptible.
</p>
<p>But the height of this ftate of things did not appear at firft. The
</p>
<p>father, who loft his freedom, felt through life as if he had fuffered
</p>
<p>wrong. The fon had heard of the oppreffion from his father :
</p>
<p>he fek fomething of it ; but what the eye does not fee, the heart
</p>
<p>does not diftinaiy feel, the impreflion abates, and after a few gen-
</p>
<p>erations the heir apparent of the miferies of fociety comes into the
</p>
<p>world a (lave, he looks like a flave in every feature, he feels like a
</p>
<p>fiave, his firft impreffion is that he came into the world to labor
</p>
<p>in the fcrvice of others, to obey his mafters and to return to duft
</p>
<p>when he is ordered to do fo. He patiently repairs to that part of
</p>
<p>his lord's lands, where he is to have the honor to encounter thirties
</p>
<p>and thorns, and as patiently leaves his labor to follow his lord into
</p>
<p>the field of battle. Through thick ranks of needy dependants on
</p>
<p>royal favor, he feldom fees fo far as to his majefty's throne, and
</p>
<p>through ranks of proud prelates he never fees to heaven. As his
</p>
<p>body is under the dominion of fyftems, fo is his mind. He never
</p>
<p>dreams of toleration : the height of his ambition is to know what
</p>
<p>he is to believe, and if the creed comprehends thirty-nine articles
</p>
<p>or ten times that number, it is all of a piece to him ; he believes
</p>
<p>the whole of it. As to liberty he has no conception of it. In
</p>
<p>fuch aviewof things, the ^^ord% political equality and the majejly of
</p>
<p>the people 2Xt ridiculous. There is neither equality nor majeity
</p>
<p>predicable of a fet of beings, who have no power, no will, no
</p>
<p>choice, and who have loft the fpirit to affert their right to bread,
</p>
<p>founded in the a<51: of earning it.
</p>
<p>Such was the condition of England at the opening of our revo-
</p>
<p>lution, and predicated on this condition were all the fyftems oF
</p>
<p>poHcy, legiflation, ecclefiaftical and legal relations, which inform-

<p>and fuch is the bafis of the European political trads, out of which
</p>
<p>our young unionifts now learn their kffons, Britain was above
</p>
<p>the reft of Europe by reafon of occafionai revolution, remnants
</p>
<p>of charters, the eloquence of patriots and the fuperior Ivgl^t of
</p>
<p>philofophers, who could difcern through the gloom fome poflibility
</p>
<p>of a republican government ; but their ideas were regarded as viU
</p>
<p>ionary. Though free from monkifh darknefs ; yet with a weight
</p>
<p>of debt the poifon of fyftems had wrought throughout the frame
</p>
<p>of Britain, and the remnant of her religion and liberties were un-
</p>
<p>der the control of men, who hate both in 4)roportion as each is
</p>
<p>hoftlle to all their pride. Thus Britain, exhibited the two clafles
</p>
<p>of lords 2Sid. peopky though the charaderiftic difference was iels

<p>diftina than in the kingdoms on the continent.

</p>
<p>When Erltain offered us the wager of battle- on tlie qiieftioi*,
</p>
<p>** Whether he who earnt bread fiiould eat it," the people of
</p>
<p>America deUberately decided to accept itj and it was the people,
</p>
<p>reprefented in congrefs, who declared our independence, and the
</p>
<p>title of an American republic will always be, " We the people of
</p>
<p>the United States." By that revolution the people recovered from
</p>
<p>the contempt and humiliation in which they had been held, regain-
</p>
<p>ed their raajedy and aiTumed to tranfmit this charafter to pofterity.
</p>
<p>The eftabiifhment of the fimple propofition, " that he who
</p>
<p>earnt bread fhould eat it," changed the whole face of fociety,
</p>
<p>and the people were to iffue the allowances inftead of receiving
</p>
<p>them from their lords. The conf.-quence ot experiment on it
</p>
<p>would have been the ruin of all, who calculated to live and be
</p>
<p>wealthy v/ithout rendering fervices to fociety. Before it would
</p>
<p>have fied ail excellive emoluments  much of the expences of liti-
</p>
<p>gation, and inftead of looking up to the heights for wealth, and
</p>
<p>for fplendor among men exalted above fervice, we fhould have
</p>
<p>fought for competence among the people. No inordinate taxes,
</p>
<p>to fupport ufelefs expences, would have driven the citizen to be
</p>
<p>anxious for high prices at the expence of other nations. The
</p>
<p>idolatry of wealth and magnificence, and the contempt of poverty
</p>
<p>and plainnefs, which ftimulate courts to impoverifh a country,
</p>
<p>demoralizes a people and enfures their degradation, and whenever
</p>
<p>the great men can command all the wealth of a country the peo-
</p>
<p>ple will be ilaves, and a fet of artificial principles will take place
</p>
<p>of thofe derived from nature and reafon.
</p>
<p>But our people had difcovered that the great men, who in other
</p>
<p>nations had robbed men like themfelves and continued to opprefs
</p>
<p>them,, had no fuperior claims to refpe<5t, and that dukes, earls
</p>
<p>and even kings rather deferved the execration than the homage of
</p>
<p>the multitude. They ceafed to eftimate men by their titles or
</p>
<p>wealth, and high birth and low birth were of equal rank. Mur-
</p>
<p>ders and robberies appeared to them as dreadful in high life as ia
</p>
<p>low life, and they faw no extenuation of crime in a commiffioa

<p>to commit it. Strip our world of its rattles and ribbons and where
</p>
<p>is all its grandeur ? And if thefe conflitute the nobility of man,
</p>
<p>v/hat is he I
</p>
<p>Aa experiment on fjch an unfafhionable revolutionary fentiment
</p>
<p>would have fhocked every delicate nerve and alarmed every man,
</p>
<p>who dreaded equality with his fellow-mortals as a premature death.
</p>
<p>But mere perfonal freedom was not the only objeft : the mind
</p>
<p>of man had been enflaved for centuries, and its ilrongeft fetters
</p>
<p>had been put on by the clergy. Toleration became a favorite
</p>
<p>theme and the people refolved that religion was a conneftion be-
</p>
<p>tween God and man ; that as every man was to render account
</p>
<p>for himfelf he ought to think and decide for himfelf, and that the
</p>
<p>niind onght always to be balanced by the greatefl weight of evi-
</p>
<p>dence.  This was a point of refolution, which church and ftate
</p>
<p>could not endure. An experiment of this would have dedroyed
</p>
<p>all dignities in the church, have exploded all eftablilhments, and
</p>
<p>have reduced even the moll powerful of the clergy to the fimple
</p>
<p>elements of fenfe and ufefulnefs. Hard lot indeed that a domin-
</p>
<p>ion over the confcience, which had been gained by the labor of
</p>
<p>a century, fliould be wholly loft:, and that common people Ihould
</p>
<p>read and expound their bibles ! This would be lowering the
</p>
<p>ambafTadors af once and dedroying a kind of influence, v/hich
</p>
<p>our American nobles would need for the re-eftablifhment of the
</p>
<p>old order of things ; for amidft all the ardors of the revolution
</p>
<p>every fubtle unionift kept fight of the do<5trines of the old fchooi,
</p>
<p>and refolved that when a proper feafon fliould arrive, the people
</p>
<p>of this country fhould be as the people of other countries, the
</p>
<p>nation fhould be as great as other nations, and our leaders in church
</p>
<p>and (late like thofe of other countries.
</p>
<p>The people had feen that religion and liberty had always
</p>
<p>been in danger, and that this danger arofe nvholly from the
</p>
<p>fact that thofe, who excited alarms about them, had their exclu-
</p>
<p>live management, and that neither could exift: within the region
</p>
<p>of their examples and power  and to the dodlrines of paiTive
</p>
<p>obedience and non-refiftance they oppofed the manly fentiment,
</p>
<p>'* That rebellion against tyrants is obedience to
</p>
<p>God.'*
</p>
<p>Such revolutionary fentiments appeared rational in the days of
</p>
<p>the revolution ; they v/ere well underflood by the people ; they
</p>
<p>were all fufceptible of pradice ; but the application of them
</p>
<p>would have been ruin to our unionills, the champions of the throne
</p>
<p>and the altar. They hated fuch fentiments with a cordial hatred,
</p>
<p>and from this hatred they were led to thofe meafurts, which have
</p>
<p>degraded the people moie rapidly than their mod: fanguine hopes
</p>
<p>could have calculated, and thefe meafures have aiTumed the form
</p>
<p>of a confpiracy in that very union of church and ftate, where the

<p>View of the natural Impediments to a Republican Government^
</p>
<p>ivhich the JJniomJls have improved to aid their Confpiracy*
</p>
<p>k_5 OCIETY being made up of individuals each member turns
</p>
<p>into flock his private pafTions and prejudices, and hence there
</p>
<p>is the fame want of firmnefs, and the fame defeat of reliance
</p>
<p>on experience, attached to nations as are found in the majority
</p>
<p>Ji6
</p>
<p>of men cotripofing them. When experience Is oppofed to our paf-
</p>
<p>fions, we reafon and praflife againft its precepts, vainly calculating
</p>
<p>that our fuperior wifdom or good fortune will guide us clear of tha
</p>
<p>evils, to which the fame practices have expofed others. Nations
</p>
<p>will haz'ird political experiments, which have uniformly deftroyed
</p>
<p>other nations. The firft article of notice under this head will be,
</p>
<p>the devotion of our people to great men.
</p>
<p>All hiftory had fliewn that the intereft of thefe was wholly op-
</p>
<p>pofed to that of the people. Refledlion taught that with every
</p>
<p>check and reftraint they would gain more than their Ihare of power
</p>
<p>and wealth. The whole providence of God (hewed that there was
</p>
<p>no particular conneflion between great talents and goodnefs, and
</p>
<p>the hiftory of redemption taught that there never would be. Great
</p>
<p>men will do well enough, if they are not overfed ; but fuch is tha
</p>
<p>conftitution of man that if you overload him with wealth or power,
</p>
<p>you ruin him. You may always trace not only the calamities but
</p>
<p>the ruin of nations to great men, and no man would look among the
</p>
<p>common people for the fource of political mifchiefs ; but oftr great
</p>
<p>men were better than thofe tvho had gone before them. This impref-
</p>
<p>fion has been the bane of all before us. What nation ever dared to
</p>
<p>think lightly of its great men ? Will the French people dare to
</p>
<p>think lightly of Buonaparte and his aflbciates in the confulate \ 
</p>
<p>No ! in full confidence that his goodnefs is equal to his bravery,
</p>
<p>they will eftablifh him for life. He will then fhew them fome fam-
</p>
<p>ples of greatnefs, and they v^ll fhew him in return free accefs to a
</p>
<p>country, where there are no confulsybr /i/>.
</p>
<p>The fervility of the human character under this head has been a
</p>
<p>dreadful impediment to freedom. A man cannot be fovereign who
</p>
<p>feels like a flave ; a people cannot be fovereign, who feel as if they
</p>
<p>ought to have mafters. An intelligent firmnefs refting on principle,
</p>
<p>muft accompany afenfe offovereignty in any people, and this firm-
</p>
<p>nefs can never be gained but in the feafon of a revolution. When

<p>ment to republicanifm.
</p>
<p>Our anceftors had fcen enough of great men in the events which
</p>
<p>drove them from their native country, and furely could not refpedt
</p>
<p>their motives ; but when the minions of his majefty came over

<p>order of beings : The records of that day fhew a fervility tow.ards
</p>
<p>his majefty and his majefty's minifters, and his majefty's gov-
</p>
<p>ernors, inconfiftent with republicanifm. Our great men (for
</p>
<p>we had a few of them in that day) fpoke with great reverence of
</p>
<p>* The bed, on which Sir Edmond Andrus lodged in New-Haven, and the
</p>
<p>chiir, in which he fat, have been prefcrved with great care, while chairs

</p>
<p>the prayers were full of compliments to the royal family, and it

<p>was not unfrequent to recite all their names in a petition to the
</p>
<p>throne of grace : the magna charta was efteemed a moft gracious
</p>
<p>boon, and charters were received with the profoundeft fubmiflion.

<p>dire<5led our armies and fecured our independence, for purpofes,
</p>
<p>infinitely variant from thofe, which have been purfue4 by our great

<p>men. The fame records give no intimation, that we were redeem-
</p>
<p>ed from foreign to domeftic opprefTion ; from Britifh armies, Ba-

<p>might be placed in a fituation, inconvenient to himfelf and ufelefs

<p>pointment of the people for four years on fuch a fubjecl would pro-
</p>
<p>bably caufe a convuiiion, yet our northern unionifls are oppofed to
</p>
<p>any amendment. They hope to gain by this defecl: in the confH-
</p>
<p>tution a fifth balance, viz. the power of the minority over all the
</p>
<p>reft, which balance, if once fuffered to turn thefcales, would in-
</p>
<p>ftantly deflroythe government.
</p>
<p>In the houfe of reprefentatives was repofed the people's (Irength,
</p>
<p>and here it is fafe fo long as their elections are uncorrupted, and
</p>
<p>fo long as their prcfident and his adminiftration are republican ;
</p>
<p>but with an ariftocratic preliderit, the majority in the houfe
</p>
<p>will forget their conftituents, and Britifh treaties and flamp

<p>adls will rgife their detefled heads againil: the fpirit of t^e revolu-

<p>which the people may wifn, fhall run the gauntlet of t^uo thirds o

<p>the fenate, t<wo thinh of the houfe of reprefeatatives and the

<p>iegiflatjires or conventions of three fourths of the Hates. Since

<p>it has not pleafed the minority in the fenate to accede to the ob-

</p>
<p>The refolution of the great men to avail themfelves of the

<p>independence only originated in this occafion. Its details are

<p>vifible at every advance.
</p>
<p>To deflroy the balance of the people all the fciences of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment were introduced in ou*r national councils ; rapid difcov-
</p>
<p>eries of the wifdom of European governments were made ; long

<p>fpeeches were the order of the day, and the people, who'

<p>iinew nothing of Latin and Greek and little of ancient and

<p>modern hiftory, and who had no conception o^ a republican goV'

<p>A Rranje (late of things was introduced, the people underftood

<p>nothing about it ; but they retained their honeft confidence ; the

<p>poHtical clergy of New-England made rapid converfions to the

<p>" you have patience to wait." . .
</p>
<p>But feveral new difcoveries were made, viz. that the objed: of
</p>
<p>our revolution was vifionary  that a reprefentative of 30,000
</p>
<p>people is not in fa<St their reprefentative, but that he reprelents ail
</p>
<p>the United States, and that religion was very ,cIofely conneded
</p>
<p>with the exifting order of things. The firft of thefe propofitions
</p>
<p>was a grofs infult on the people^  the fecond was a vital aim" at the
</p>
<p>only power, which the people retained, and the third was wholly
</p>
<p>'myfterious ; but the argument was, " Be quiet, great men are at
</p>
<p>lielm." The men, who called the revolution viiiqi>ary, tr-e-Ated it

<p>* Dr. ' William S. Johnfoti.
</p>
<p>as fuch, ridiculed its. principles, outraged its advocates and adopt-
</p>
<p>ed every meafure, which could impoverifh and humble \p friends.
</p>
<p>When the patriotic republicans were oppofing the Britifh treaty,
</p>
<p>our northern unionifts confidered it a glorious manoeavre in one ot
</p>
<p>their number* to let loofe the Savages ^fuddenly in favor of the
</p>
<p>treaty and to carry by a war of words a mealure, which a world
</p>
<p>of woes had been indured to prevent. Patiently did ovir people
</p>
<p>hearthemfelves called a mob ! a rabble ! deftitute of fenfe, their
</p>
<p>own worft enemies, ignorant of their rights and having only dif-
</p>
<p>cretion enough to feledfor their rulers the rn;en, who defpifedand
</p>
<p>abufed them.
</p>
<p>This was a glorious height of character for a people, who were
</p>
<p>but" a few years before founding, " death or liberty." They had
</p>
<p>efcaped a natural death in their conteds with Britain, and had the
</p>
<p>honor to meet a political death and the lofs of liberty from men,
</p>
<p>v/ho affefled to fupport republicanifm. The point wis gained by
</p>
<p>the New-England unionilts, that the great men fhouid deal oui-
</p>
<p>allowances to the people, and the fervility of the people, which
</p>
<p>the revolution had for ^ moment removed, was reilored under
</p>
<p>circumiUnces, promiling its perpetual duration :  BiA there were
</p>
<p>other impediments to a republican government, whichfthe-northern

<p>hated republicanifm, becaufe it v/as oppofed to their religious fyf-

<p>ftock, will bud and blofTom through life. The greateft fcience of

<p>a clergyman confifts in his having realized the depravity of man,

<p>his nothingnefs, his duty to be huoible and his deftitutioa of claim

<p>* Mr. Ames.
</p>
<p>to the mercy oF God or the hamage of man. IF feeling thefe
</p>
<p>things he is perfonally humble, uniolicitous of applaule, ardent
</p>
<p>for the fphitual good of man, and fenfibie ot his unfitnefs to guide
</p>
<p>their political concerns : in fact, if he has modelled his character
</p>
<p>after the fafnion of the New-Teftament, he will fecure a kind of
</p>
<p>refpe^t ; but how many of them in New-England have been po-
</p>
<p>litical preachers, zealous for war, for trixes, for impriionment and
</p>
<p>for every thing, which could humble the common people.
</p>
<p>If chriftianity is the fame as it v/as in the days of the Apoftles,
</p>
<p>and if republicanifm is what it was in the days of our revolution,
</p>
<p>church and ftate is neither chriltiaw or republican ; yet they have
</p>
<p>the names and forms of both and affe(5t to praftice them as far as
</p>
<p>the ftate of the fociety and their own tempers will^jermit ; but
</p>
<p>this is a kind of conformity, which the fpirit of both of them
</p>
<p>difowns.
</p>
<p>Previous to our revolution there were fome thoufands of men
</p>
<p>in New-England, who had a religion of the Ji?yi day of the iveek,
</p>
<p>and who believed !r> what the clergyman faid on that day. Their
</p>
<p>children were early brought forward to believe and the out-door re-
</p>
<p>ligion was ^JDundant ; but if any layman undertook to believe for
</p>
<p>himfelf or|b doubt what he was told, they were air ready to leave
</p>
<p>their work in order to calf him out of the fynagogue. With fuch
</p>
<p>impreffions, we began the revolution, and let the world theori:^e as
</p>
<p>they v/ill, ^he llavery thus induced is never entirely worn oC A
</p>
<p>man, v/hoSs early told that he muff believe certain things, and that
</p>
<p>lie muft do it at this moment or the door of grace wiii be forever
</p>
<p>fliut, is very apt to believe ; yet his belief under a threat that eter-
</p>
<p>nal mifery will be the confequence of his doubting, is no better
</p>
<p>than a promife made under durefs or a confeflion with a bayonet at
</p>
<p>the breafl. The man, who beheves a few times in this way lofes
</p>
<p>the freedom of his mind, and he who makes him believe, becomes
</p>
<p>his mafter. Men may call this an infidel fentiment ; but in my
</p>
<p>view the man, who profeffes to bdieve, and yet his mind has not
</p>
<p>prevailing evidence of the truth or exigence of what he believes is
</p>
<p>both hypocrite and infidel. In an atbmipt to deceive others he, be-

<p>trays himfelf.  Bwt the people were not united in their faith : they
</p>
<p>had ail forts of creeds ; bu.t agreed in tliis one point, that the cler-
</p>
<p>gy of all denominations mud be revered, and the clergy of all
</p>
<p>differing denominations appeared to unite in .approving this fenti-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>No harm could/follow from this reverence, provided it extend-
</p>
<p>ed no farther than to a rational refpeft for them in their profeffions ;
</p>
<p>but when a kind of infallibility was attached to them even in
</p>
<p>fpiritual concerns, chriifianity muft have fuffered by it : the liber-
</p>
<p>ty of the Son of God is never gained by any obfequioufnefs of
</p>
<p>confcience : but when this infallibility extended to men and
</p>
<p>meafures of government, it was dangerous to civil liberty  and
</p>
<p>^^
</p>
<p>when fubtle civilians, willing to gain promotion on any bafe
</p>
<p>terms, availed themfelvcs of this intallibility for thlir. benefit, it
</p>
<p>was defi:ru6llvc. Yet under thefe inaufpicious impecllments v/e
</p>
<p>began the revolution, and when we ref}e(5l what our condition was
</p>
<p>at that time, and what it now is in refped to thefe unionifts, we
</p>
<p>may form fame eftimate of the fincerity, with which the unionills
</p>
<p>prayed or fought for the religious and civil liberty of ike people.
</p>
<p>They were fincere fo far as refpe<fted foreign domination ; but all
</p>
<p>ctheir pad lives and fyftems v/ould have been loft to tli^fm had they
</p>
<p>fought to leave men to purfue religion as a perfonal cpncern be-
</p>
<p>tween themfelves and their Maker, or had they aimed to depend
</p>
<p>for political confequence on talents and fervices, inftead of relHng
</p>
<p>on the artificial and long eftabliflied influence of church and ftate.
</p>
<p>Viable intolerance had abated in New-England ; there was no
</p>
<p>written law in force that none but church members Ihould be free
</p>
<p>burgefTes ; yet the avowed charge of Chrift's chuvgk was in our
</p>
<p>law-books, fonie nice points of theology were ^tled in our
</p>
<p>llatutes, and the common law of church and ftate was in full
</p>
<p>force. No man could tell what this was, any more than our lav/-
</p>
<p>yers can tell what the common law of this countrj is ; yet the
</p>
<p>general operation of both thefe common laws was, 3^at the craftf-
</p>
<p>men underftood the profit of thera, and that they operated great
</p>
<p>mifchief to the people. There was no vifible pope with his
</p>
<p>council of cardinals ; yet in many of our parifhes^was a great
</p>
<p>infallible and feveral little infallibles, who pronounce^ with great
</p>
<p>wifdom on the divine counfels, which had been hid from ages,
</p>
<p>and who decided with raagifterial certainty on controverfial points
</p>
<p>which had been difputed by the ableft men for centuries. Civil
</p>
<p>ofhces were fubordinate to this ftate of things, and the fpirit of
</p>
<p>church and ftate was really more dangerous to civil liberty and
</p>

<p>gain this objciSt it was irnportant for our leaders to acquire that
</p>
<p>power, which Great-Britain pofiefted, and having gainci this
</p>
<p>power, they have conv^erted the whole of it to the ftrengthening
</p>
<p>of their union, and in return have diredltd the acquired ftrengfh
</p>
<p>to the deftruftion of the liberty'-, profefted to be aimed' at in the revo-
</p>
<p>lution. Thus the people, after their fucceftes, repofing on church
</p>
<p>and ftate, have leaned on a reed, which has pierced them through.
</p>
<p>A precife knowledge of the chara6ler of New-England under
</p>
<p>this head is as neceftary to a civilian as a knowledge of anatomy
</p>
<p>is to a furgeon. Were you to difTedl a New-England man, ycu
</p>
<p>would find about him kraps of undigefiied creeds, in which his
</p>
<p>own reafon had no kind of agency. Our New-England mem-
</p>
<p>bers of congrefs talk in fcripture dialed : our lay theologians
</p>
<p>^34
</p>
<p>quote catechifms as found theology ; our urtionifts talk of grace
</p>
<p>by rote, and even our paragraph v/ritcrs fill infenfibly into tefta-
</p>
<p>ment allufions, witliout the lead intention of paying court to the
</p>
<p>clergy. We learn from our cradles a number of prejudices,
</p>
<p>whlcti our mature exertions, added to the ableft reafonings, are
</p>
<p>unable to abate. With thefe ideas in view, we (hall fee the por-
</p>
<p>tion of church and ftate religion, which was \voven into the web
</p>
<p>of our 1 evolution, and hence the impediments to civil and reli-
</p>
<p>gious libeity, and the eafe with which our unionifts could always
</p>
<p>oppofe tha advances of a republican government.
</p>
<p>This impediment being explained, it remains to remark in this
</p>
<p>numbtr a lubftantial and durable impediment connected with it,
</p>
<p>which operates with great force, viz. the refcmblance of the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, for which we profefTed to fight, to the religion, which
</p>
<p>we profeffed to approve.  . ,
</p>
<p>Pure rept|||ficaaifni is as perfeftly fuited to trie political interefts
</p>
<p>orthecomnPn people, as chriAianity is to their i]iritual con-
</p>
<p>cerns: but it demands fuch a facrifice of the pafiions, fuch a
</p>
<p>devotion to the public good, fuch undeviating regard to judiccand
</p>
<p>peace, that ttven the common people cannot long preferve it in its
</p>
<p>purity. Rq^ablicanifm ** deligius in the region of civil and do-
</p>
<p>meftic quiet, extends its bleffings to the fields of labor, and vifits
</p>
<p>thofe moft, who moft approve it.'' Revolutions produce a feafon
</p>
<p>of political virtue in the oppreffed, and conceal thofe paffions,
</p>
<p>which are liereafter to attempt the defl:ru6tion of their natural
</p>
<p>effe5ls. The eafe of turning this impediment to federal account
</p>
<p>will be readily conceived.
</p>
<p>But we had been under Englifh dominion, and had imbibed
</p>
<p>Tqany aixtirepublican maxims of government, which were fo en-
</p>
<p>twined with our other knowledge, ^that^it was next to impolTibie
</p>
<p>to detach them. It is eafier to conquer well difcinlined troops
</p>
<p>than old prejudices, and the talk is rendered more hopelefs, pro-
</p>
<p>vided at the moment of our attempting to reduce them a pov/erful

<p>which is indilpenfible to republicanifm, was a principle too mighty
</p>
<p>to be adopted in its full force by the people, unlefs their leaders
</p>
<p>would precede them in it ; but the leaders fecretly abhored the
</p>
<p>principle, while in public they affcded to idolize it. The world
</p>
<p>had fo long kept f:;rvants in chariots and mafters on foot, that to
</p>
<p>.change this courfe required a powerful effort in the public mind.
</p>
<p>The principle was nominally ertablidied ; but its mod vital enemies
</p>
<p>were the ftewards of its own houfehold. Connedlicut had a repub-
</p>
<p>lican government of a very fimple conflrudion : ele<51ions were
</p>
<p>fcmiannual and the people enjoyed u kind of fovereignty j but all
</p>
<p>the power in operation was fo trifling, that the fenfe of fovereign-
</p>
<p>ty was hardly fufccptible. A popular fovereignty to be extended
</p>
<p>throughout the continent, balancing the jaring interefls of the
</p>
<p>^35
</p>
<p>flates and fiabduing ailftocracies of talents, wealth an4 ptofefFiOug,
</p>
<p>prefented eiiibarraffments, not alarming in the feafon of the revo-
</p>
<p>lution, but formidable when this fovereignty was committed to
</p>
<p>men, whofe political exiftence depend on its deftruflion.
</p>
<p>To thefe impediments may be added the zeal of our northern
</p>
<p>people for wealth, for enterprize and for comparative .weight in
</p>
<p>political fcales.  More of their paffions were filenced'than fub-
</p>
<p>dued. Every bkffing of the revolution depended on good man-
</p>
<p>agement afterwards. A vidory is worfe than notJung, if you
</p>
<p>leave the fortreffes which you have taken to be garrifoned by the
</p>
<p>troops which you have recently conquered.
</p>
<p>Our artful unionifts knew this to be the ftate of the public mind :
</p>
<p>they faw the facility of tiirning it to their account : they felt a
</p>
<p>cordial enmity to the principle of popular fovereignty. Hence
</p>
<p>the pailions, defcribed in the laft number of the lirft part, were
</p>
<p>let loofs on the principles of the revolution, zr\0:z fyftem of

<p>Partiality for our own country fhould not exclude an admiffion
</p>
<p>that in all feafons we have had a clafs of men, whofe feelings and

<p>interefts -^tx^ from various caufes oppofed to thofe of the people,
</p>
<p>and that the rights' of the people committed tl this clafs wi^l bc'in
</p>
<p>danger. Reading and reflexion are ufeful in teaching us to avoid
</p>
<p>^3^
</p>
<p>evils, but it did not require the forefight of Locke or Newton to
</p>
<p>difcern that if at any future day the tories, the monarchifls, the
</p>
<p>political clergy and the civihans dependant on them fhould harmo-
</p>
<p>nize in meafures, thofe meafures would be antirepublican.
</p>
<p>As there were two clafTes of men in our country, different in
</p>
<p>obje6ts, fo there were two paths to purfue. One was the narrow
</p>
<p>and hiHnl>lls path of rehgion, competence and peace, the delega-
</p>
<p>tion of thj^^ moderate powers, neceffary to fuch a condition, and
</p>
<p>the beftownjint of confidence on men, " who like the fun would
</p>
<p>ihine not for their own good, but for that of the fyrtem ;" a per-
</p>
<p>petual pledge on the part of the rulers to refpeft the fovereignty
</p>
<p>of the people and the principles of their revolution  and an unde-
</p>
<p>viating firmnefs in the people to employ none, who refufed to ac-
</p>
<p>cept of truft on fuch terms. The other was the high and broad
</p>
<p>road of national glory. The courfe of the firO: was not found in
</p>
<p>any map of ilM world nor any page of hiftory. The other was
</p>
<p>in every mapPand every hiftory. The firft led to the fields of
</p>
<p>labor, where gains are flow and fure, and the laft condudled to a
</p>
<p>lottery, where an enormous prize and feveral great prizes conceal
</p>
<p>from the adveaturers the great multitude of blanks and the chances
</p>
<p>of lofs. It was eafy to fee that the day, on which the lafl: of
</p>
<p>thefe paths fhould be decided on would be a dark day for the
</p>
<p>friends of the revolution : and fuch it has proved, *' a morning
</p>
<p>of clouds andlncreafing in gloom to the clofe of it."
</p>
<p>The advopatcs of national glory are full of dignity : they fcorn
</p>
<p>the low region of the afFeftions ; they annihiliate revolutions by
</p>
<p>deftroying their infant eflTedts. The work of conciliation with the
</p>
<p>domeftic enemies of our caufe conftituted the funeral obfequies to
</p>
<p>our departed brethren.* This was the firft overtax of our union-
</p>
<p>ids. I call it tbeir ad, becaufe in this policy as well as in every

<p>puerile fuch feRtimenis ; but theirs are not puerile; they exhibit an alarm-

<p>adopted them. A marriao^e union between the leaders of nations, which

<p>had exhaufted each other's blood and trea'fure, has ciofed with a feftival, the
</p>
<p>defolation of war, and the uiiftrable pantomimes of courtiers haye fuc-

<p>ceeded to tragedies, whofe imprtflioris ought never to have been loft. A

</p>
<p>nefs. The manner in which the convention was compofed, illuf-
</p>
<p>trates this, and every cardinal meafure of the government was a
</p>
<p>frefh declaration to the people in favor of the do<ftrines of the old
</p>
<p>fchool.
</p>
<p>Having prefented confiderations enough to lead you to contem-
</p>
<p>plate the extreme probability that your rights would be violated by
</p>
<p>the men firfl: in power, and having in view the fa<5t that /or attempt-
</p>
<p>ing fuch violation the 'voice of the people has deprived them of confi-

<p>dence, I fliall proceed to exhibit the progrefs of thefe violations,
</p>
<p>difpofing in my advance of the confiderations, calculated to pre-
</p>
<p>vent your impartial decifion.
</p>
<p>The leader of our armies was placed at the head of our councils.
</p>
<p>His name was a hoft in fiivor of that party, which could avail
</p>
<p>themfelves of it, and though this name was the property of the
</p>
<p>people, who had aflifled to gain it ; yet the leaders feized on it,
</p>
<p>and with this advantage thty eftablifhed the funding fyftem. I
</p>
<p>have already adverted to this : but as it was th? radical caufe of
</p>
<p>our evils, the political fail, which fubjeded us to the lofs of an
</p>
<p>American Eden arid to innumerable curfes, it deferves recurrence.
</p>
<p>It has never been pretended that the prefident faw all the ten-
</p>
<p>dency of this meafure, or that he had any conception that much of
</p>
<p>the paper had been artfully and wickedly drawn into the hands of
</p>
<p>Britifti agents, tories, rich capitalifts and (in many confpicuous
</p>
<p>inftances) of men high in office ! furely he had not forgotten (he
</p>
<p>could never forget) the interefting moment, when bidding adieu to
</p>
<p>the brave officers and foldiers, whom he commanded, he pledged
</p>
<p>to them his facred honor that their fervices fhould be faithfully
</p>
<p>remunerated. Thofe, who pretend that he underftood this mea-
</p>
<p>fare, would deprive him of a claim to the gratitude of his coua^
</p>
<p>try.

<p>What did the ftrong advocates of that fyftem contemplate ? Na-

<p>means, which experience had taughf I There was in this bufmefs
</p>
<p>no Machiavel, no Sully, Richlieu or Mazarin. All was plain
</p>
<p>work. Europe was full of copperplate copies on this fubjedt. A
</p>
<p>man of fix feet in height could as well plan a funding fyftem as
</p>
<p>one of fi5cty : a boy can copy : but it required more than the or-
</p>
<p>dinary fortitude of a man to refolve to deprive the army of their
</p>
<p>hard earned reward, to ftab the vitals of the revolution, to fink,
</p>
<p>in the duft the hopes of millions, to eftabHffi in power the enemies
</p>
<p>of the revolution, and to lay the foundation of numerous, cruel
</p>
<p>ariftocracies. This required nerves probably more than any Amer 
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>' 38 -
</p>
<p>itan pofleiTed. A foreigner* was prime leader of the funding
</p>
<p>lyftem. In thofe days It ivas not criminal to have a foreigner at the
</p>
<p>head of the treafury. It required ftrong nerves to drive fuch a
</p>
<p>meafure againft the whole force of fouthern eloquence, againft
</p>
<p>manifeft equity, and againft the temper of the people. The
</p>
<p>magic v/ords of " national honor^^ were founded in vain, and the
</p>
<p>meafure was not carried, till the monied ariftocracy, intended to be
</p>
<p>created by the fyftem, became powerful enough to give itfelf a
</p>
<p>being. A funding fyftem is an engine of prodigious powers, it
</p>
<p>creates as many ariftocracies as can be fubfervient to it, and has
</p>
<p>the complete control over them all. Thus among the firit fruits
</p>
<p>of this meafure, America was to eftablifh a credit in Europe,
</p>
<p>fjounded on our having purchafed, at feventy millions, paper not
</p>
<p>worth in market fifteen ; by our having violated an eternal obliga-
</p>
<p>tion of paying it to the nien^ who earned it, and having afTumed
</p>
<p>the legal and precife idea of paying it to the men, who merely-
</p>
<p>held the evidences of its having been earnt : in fadt, ly a great
</p>
<p>political frauds we were to become great among tliC nations.
</p>
<p>This gave glorious occafion to raife a diplomatic ariftocracy by
</p>
<p>fending to the courts of Europe American monarchifts, who with
</p>
<p>great outfits and falaries were to perfuade them how much we re-
</p>
<p>Ipefted them, and how anxious we were to receive in return their
</p>
<p>Hammonfds and Liftons to expedite us in following their fteps. 
</p>
<p>Under this monied ariftocracy were foon ranged all its advocates
</p>
<p>in the fubordinate ar!,ftocracies of the compting-houfe, the bar, the
</p>
<p>delli and the fword. For all thefe no balance was provided by the
</p>
<p>cohftitution. New-England church and ftate was forward and
</p>
<p>vilible in all this bufmefs, and through its influence the murmurs of
</p>
<p>the people were huflied.
</p>
<p>When the moral faculty of a nation has been depraved, every
</p>
<p>deftru6tive confequence will follow. The funding fyftem took
</p>
<p>the place of the energies which it deftroyed, appointed members
</p>
<p>of congrefs, devifed plans of expence, enlifted the preftes, and
</p>
<p>managed all the appeals to the fears of danger, and luft of wealth,

<p>icmark, that he is probably a brave man, and doubtlcfs a man of fuperior

<p>Had the Britifli miniftry been commiffioned to manage our con-
</p>
<p>cerns, they would have adopted the fame meafures.
</p>
<p>This treaty, made in 1794, was entitled a treaty of amity,
</p>
<p>commerce and navigation, and the firft article provided that there
</p>
<p>ihould be a firm, inviolable and univerfal peace, and a true and
</p>
<p>ftncere friendfiip between his Britanic majelty, his heirs and fiic
</p>
<p>cefiors, and the United States of America, and between their
</p>
<p>refpeaive countries, territories, cities, towns and people of every

<p>degree J nvithrmt exception of per fons or places. If the funding lyl-
</p>
<p>tem wJls the warning, this was the ftroke of death to our inde-

<p>pendence. But a few years before, this fame king had *' plunder-
</p>
<p>" ed our feas, ravaged our coafts, burnt our towns and deftroyed
</p>
<p>" the lives of our people; He had tranfported large armies of
</p>
<p>" foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, defolation
</p>
<p><* and tyranny, fcarcely paralleled in the moft barbarous ages, and

<p>" totally unv.'orthy the head of a civilized nation. He had con-

<p>" bear arms again ft their country, to become the executioners of
</p>
<p>* their friends and brethren, or to fall themfelves by their hands.

<p>" He had excited domeftic infurreftions among us, and had en-

<p>never ceafed to be abhored by them throughout the union. It
</p>
<p>vas approved by the federalifts in congreft, iigned with reludance
</p>
<p>by the PreCdent, admired by the tories, Britifh agents, all the
</p>
<p>ariftocracies, and New-England church and ftate has never failed
</p>
<p>to give it a cordial fupport.
</p>
<p>After reading this treaty, we need not wonder at finding in the
</p>
<p>next page a treaty of amity with the Dey of Algiers, in which
</p>
<p>the proiHtuted affedlions of Americans were offered to Haffan
</p>
<p>Bafhaw, his Divan and fubjeds, and on other occafions they were
</p>
<p>at the fervice of every petty prince, who had a J'eaport. Thus
</p>
<p>under the management of a clafs of men, who always hated re-
</p>
<p>publicanifm, the United States, which in 1776, declared inde-
</p>
<p>pendeince with a folemn appeal 10 the Supreme Judge of the world
</p>
<p>for the reditude of their intentions, took early occafion, in pre-
</p>
<p>fence of that Judge, to violate plighted vows, to commit abom-
</p>
<p>inations with the kings of the earth, and to embrace thofe very
</p>
<p>principle, which had always enflaved mar* and delolated the
</p>
<p>world.

</p>
<p>\_ RESIDENT Adams, who is a confpicuous member of
</p>
<p>the New-England church and (late union, was placed at the head
</p>
<p>of our government, under circumifances, peculiarly aufpicious for
</p>
<p>an experiment of his balances of government. The majority of
</p>
<p>votes by which he was chofen, was indeed fmall, and there was
</p>
<p>fome queftion whether fair management would not have given Mr.
</p>
<p>JefFerfon the chair ; but Mr. Adams was the conftitutional preli-
</p>
<p>dent for four years, and having been a confpicuous patriot through
</p>
<p>the revolution, having held high confidential trulls in Europe, and
</p>
<p>having been vice-prefident for eight years, he took his feat with
</p>
<p>a weight of charafter and influence.
</p>
<p>The revolutionary fpirit was gone, our union with Britain was
</p>
<p>eftabiilhed, the funding fyflem was in full operation, all the ariftoc-
</p>
<p>racies were fubordinate to cabinet meafures, New-England church
</p>
<p>and flate was organized and ready to pray, preach or fight for
</p>
<p>lederal meafures, the public offices were principally filled by men

</p>
<p>Our intrigues in Europe had drawn us into a delicate fituation
</p>
<p>with France, and ftrong fufpicions were entertained by that nation
</p>
<p>that our afFe(5lions were fet on Britain  that we wifhed to quarrel
</p>
<p>with France  that our great men defpifed her revolution, and
</p>
<p>that multitudes of our people were in heart oppofed to the policy
</p>
<p>of our court. Nothing on earth was more true. Our leading
</p>
<p>men had been laboring with all their might to produce a rupture
</p>
<p>with France. Mr. Monroe had pledged enough of his charudkr
</p>
<p>on ailurances of our cordial friendfhip tor France : it was thought
</p>
<p>expedient to fend a ncv/ minifler with frelh afTurances. Every
</p>
<p>American knows that tJiis was the finefle of a court ; for previa
</p>
<p>ous to this time, inflammatory reflections agsinft France had been
</p>
<p>frequent in congrefilonal debates, and from the feat of government
</p>
<p>had been ifTued, in reports and pamphlets, tht moft daring infultss
</p>
<p>on the French nation. The new minifter, (Mr. Pinckney) was
</p>
<p>known both here and in France to be hodile to the French char-
</p>
<p>aderand revolution, and republicans have never doubted that this
</p>
<p>was the reafon of his being felecled for that m^flion. I'he French
</p>
<p>refufed him cards of hof])itaKty. He wrote difpatches. The
</p>
<p>prefident called a meetig of congrefs on the 15th of May, 1797,
</p>
<p>and in his opening fpeech, after lamenting the caiife of this meet-
</p>
<p>ing, after giving a varnifli to the charad:er of Mr. Pinckne)^,*
</p>
<p>and after opening the heinous condua of France, be fays, '* Such
</p>
<p>" attempts ought to be repelled with a decifion, which fhail con-
</p>
<p>** vince France and the world, that we are not a degraded peo-

</p>
<p>At this extraordinary feffion was brought forward the famous
</p>
<p>confpiracy of Blount, which being traced to the Britifh minifter,
</p>
<p>Liifton, was not in point for the politics of the day.
</p>
<p>The prefident difpatched Meffrs. Marfhal and Gerry to join
</p>
<p>Mr. Pinckney, on a miflion of explanation and conciliation with
</p>
<p>France ; but the plain Englifh of his fpeech on the i6th of May,
</p>
<p>and th^ ftibfequent mcafures had reached France before them,
</p>
<p>and they were not received. The (;onfequent pantomime of X,
</p>
<p>Y and Z need not be related ; the meafures, which followed the
</p>
<p>difpatches fiiew conclufively the objeft of it. Every thing tended
</p>
<p>to a rupture with France, and to the fortifying of our adminiftra-

<p>their new fyftems.

<p>houfes had the honor to think jufl as the prefident had condefcend-

</p>
<p>appropriated to enable the prefident to purchafe cannon, fmall
</p>
<p>arms, &c.  8o,coo dollars for fmail gallies.
</p>
<p>Thefe were among the preliminary war m^fures of Mr,
</p>
<p>Adams' adminiftration, all advocated by the New -England federal
</p>
<p>members^ approved by the tories and Britifh merchants, all
</p>
<p>publicly hoftiJe to the French nation. Yet our political clergy
</p>
<p>were praying for them, preaching againfl the French, charging
</p>
<p>them with a fpirit of atheifm and anarchy, and attaching thefe
</p>
<p>charges to all the republicans, who oppofed thefe meafures. The
</p>
<p>country was filled with Robifon's proofs and BarruePs memoirs,
</p>
<p>and the fealon had arrived for flriking a decifive blow at the root
</p>
<p>of republicanifm. The federal papers announced that all piety,
</p>
<p>J43
</p>
<p>virtue, patrlotifm and talents were on the federal fide ; but tht
</p>
<p>aliens were troublefome and ret^ublican papers queftioned the policy
</p>
<p>and integrity of adminiftradon,
</p>
<p> To meet ihls itate of things, to exalt church and (late, and
</p>
<p>to humble republicans, not to defend ourfdves againjl the French,
</p>
<p>the prefident was authorized to raife an army, in the event ot a
</p>
<p>declaration of war again ft us, or of aflual invafion, or of immi-
</p>
<p>nent danger of fuch hroafian difcovered in his opinion to exiji, and
</p>
<p>provifion was made for the appointment of a lieutenant general,
</p>
<p>infpeaor general, major generals, and great men enough to rum
</p>
<p>a nation, and for caps, fwovds, piftols, labres, &c. and 200,000
</p>
<p>dollars were appropriated for the firft exigencies of this bufinels.
</p>
<p>Here was a modeft opening for patronage, and a wide field ot
</p>
<p>rlory. This was a day of clues and plots, and the prdidcnt iaw
</p>
<p>danger clearly enough, and appointed the late preGdent to be
</p>
<p>norrdnal lieutenant general, Mr. Hamilton to be r../ infpeftor
</p>
<p>general, federal pockets were foon lined with commifiions,
</p>
<p>and recruiting officers were like locufts about the country.
</p>
<p>The body of the people regarded this- meafure with abhor-
</p>
<p>rence; the veil, in which this bufmefs had been wrapped,
</p>
<p>was too thin. The unionifts boldly advocated the meaure even
</p>
<p>on its real bafis, and Mr. Webfter has been fatd to fay th^t Gen.
</p>
<p>Hamilton declared the impoflibility of governing this country
</p>
<p>v/ithout a military force to aid the executive This ^ ^^f
</p>
<p>the true ground. That army was raifed on the ftrength of , artificial,
</p>
<p>well concerted difpatches, and was intended for the humihat.on
</p>
<p>of republicans and for no other purpofe. If o...r envoys were
</p>
<p>honeft, the figure dancers, under the names ol X, \ and Z, de-
</p>
<p>fcrve death for impofiDg on them.
</p>
<p>On the day, when the prefident approved this army biU, he
</p>
<p>approved another, empowering himfeli; to grant letters ot marque

<p>the alien aa was pafiid, fubjcaing the perfons of aliens, who haa

<p>fled here for refuge, to the arbitrary control of the prefident

<p>and to crown this energetic work, an aft was pafTed, decknng the
</p>
<p>treanes heretofore concluded with Francr, no longer obligatory en

</p>
<p>bXfelf.S^his was a daring (Iroke, confidenngal which had
</p>
<p>rrcc ded; but federal nerves were ilrong. Next followed
</p>
<p>a declaration of a maritime war with France, which nation then
</p>
<p>was ad has always fmce been at peace with us, and th^ prefident
</p>
<p>Tas impov-ed ti commiffion private armed velTcIs to f.-.ze. u.

</p>
<p>In the capture of the frigate Infurgent we gave them a key to aU
</p>
<p>this bufinefs, and fliewed them by a little, what a great deal of
</p>
<p>federalifm means !
</p>
<p>The vaft appropriations made at this feflion required extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary funds and mod extraordinary ones were invented.  An a6l
</p>
<p>was pafTed for the valuation and taxation of lands, dwelling-hou-
</p>
<p>fes and Haves, in the ninth fc6Hon of which provifion was made
</p>
<p>for a future window tax and in the lafl: feflion an appropriation of
</p>
<p>150,000 dollars for the expence of this ufelefs and unequal tax,
</p>
<p>which fum fell fhort more than 80,000 dollars of its aflual amount.
</p>
<p>The confequence of this was an immenfe patronage of the prefident,
</p>
<p>the country was filled with commiflioners, aflefibrs, ftirveyors &c.
</p>
<p>and our real property was mortgaged for the annual payment of fuch
</p>
<p>fums as admJniftratlon fiiould be difpofed to lay on them. This was
</p>
<p>in faft feizing the fee of our lands and placing us in the condition of
</p>
<p>lefTees tmder our liege lords of the federal cabinet. This corps of
</p>
<p>officers might filence fome doubts about the wifdom of meafures ;
</p>
<p>but left they might not eifed: it  the infamous fedition ad was ap-
</p>
<p>proved on the fame day, the proceedings under which will be re-
</p>
<p>membered with horror by every republican.
</p>
<p>Several ads for augmenting the army were made in order to rife
</p>
<p>in adion, as the federal fever rofe, and on eftimate of the expences
</p>
<p>it appeared that the two millions to be raifed on the valuation would
</p>
<p>be inadequate  the prefident was therefore impowered to borrow,
</p>
<p>on fuch terms as he fhould judge moft advantageous, five millions
</p>
<p>cf dollars. His judgement, always equal, decided on eight per-
</p>
<p>cent and at that intereft it was effeded. He was alfo impowered
</p>
<p>to borrow, at fix per-cent (of the bank) two millions to be refun-
</p>
<p>ded from the avails of the dired tax, whi<;h tax was never likely
</p>
<p>to be colleded, except it was from ftates fubjed to federal rigours.
</p>
<p>Church and (late paid it cheerfully and beftowed its bleiHng on the
</p>
<p>objeds to which it was to be applied.
</p>
<p>The laft ad of this war feflion provided that 10,000 copies of
</p>

<p>fliould be printed and diftributed gratis in the country  and this is
</p>
<p>all, which tiie people ever received for millions of their money
</p>
<p>expended in the deftrudion of their principles and in the eftabhfli-
</p>
<p>ment of a reign of terror, which if continued through another
</p>
<p>prefidential term would have entailed on themfeives and pofterity
</p>
<p>p-;rpetual flavery.
</p>
<p>Thefe meafures give the length and breadth of Mr. Adams' ad-
</p>
<p>miniftranon. The next feflion opened with a law to punifh men,
</p>
<p>who ihould (as Dodor Logan had done) improve their private in-
</p>
<p>uence and wealth to obtain from foreign governments the political
</p>
<p>or ccmmercial relations, wliich our government profeffed to wifli 
</p>
<p>the Englifli tranflation of which was, " we were not finc'iere in our

</p>
<p>have hazarded federalifm and you (Doftor Logan) are a diforgan.
</p>
<p>izer and a jacobin for attempting to effect luch conciliation." Mr.
</p>
<p>JefFerfon was greatly abufed in the debates on this a<5t.  Further
</p>
<p>meafurcs were taken to fufpend cur intercourfe with France  a mil-
</p>
<p>lion of dollars was appropriated for building fix feventy-fours. and
</p>
<p>fix floops of war  50,000 dollars for docks  200,000 dollars for
</p>
<p>fhip-timber  laws were made for the government of the navy 
</p>
<p>provifion was made to augment the army  the falarles of the pub-
</p>
<p>lic officers were raifed to the fame f urns, ivh'ich are now allowed to
</p>
<p>them  two millions, one hundred and two thoufand dollars appro-
</p>
<p>priated for the navy  one million, five hundred and forty feven
</p>
<p>thoufand dollars for the military eftablifi.ment, and more than two
</p>
<p>millions for the additional army and imraenfe additional appropria-
</p>
<p>tions for other military and naval purpofes. Federal New-Eng-
</p>
<p>land was cordial in all thefe meafures and the political clergy fuf-
</p>
<p>tained regular nominations of lawyers and feleded the moft tho-
</p>
<p>rough-going of them to fuftain the admlniflration. We will not
</p>
<p>be told that they did this in order to ferve the kingdom of Chriil
</p>
<p>or to fuftain the government, contemplated by the revolution.
</p>
<p>It is unnecefTary to purfae the meafures through another feflion.
</p>
<p>The traits of this adminiftration were friendfkip to Britain, enmity
</p>
<p>to France  duplicity in management  tendencies to inordinate ex-
</p>
<p>pence  to increafing the burdens of taxation and the weight of pub-
</p>
<p>lic debt  finking the people into a fubmiffive dependance on the ru-
</p>
<p>lers  fondnefs for a war fyftem  eagernefs for national wealth and

<p>greatnefs at the expence of principle and a determination to com-
</p>
<p>pafs, by a reign of terror, fyftems of meafur---?. which republicans
</p>
<p>abhorred.
</p>
<p>It is notorious that the unionlds of New-England have been in
</p>
<p>the fleady habit of fuftaining both at home and abroad men, who
</p>
<p>boldly and ftrenuoufly advocated fuch meafures, and the quefiion to

<p>Further view of the overt-acts of the Unionijl:,
</p>
<p>X HE outdoor work of the federalifts during the reign of
</p>
<p>terror deferves confideration.
</p>
<p>While the prefident was balancing ariftocracies here and playing

</p>
<p>people, his fon was expending his outfits of 9000 dollars and annual
</p>
<p>falaries of 9000 dollars in learning to ballance kingdoms in Europe.
</p>
<p>Regardiefs of his own loud outcry againft France, that ihe had
</p>
<p>endeavoured to alienate the afFe<5lions of our people from cur rulers,
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams coolly made a treaty with Touiffant, as governor of
</p>
<p>St. Domingo, in which the Britifh were a party^, and one fecret
</p>
<p>obje<5l was a difraemberment of that valuable colony from France.
</p>
<p>That treaty is now in the polTs'ffion of the fecretary of ftate, to-
</p>
<p>gether with the correfpondences between Mr. Pickering and Mr.
</p>
<p>S. Mayer. This was a fample of political integrity.
</p>
<p>The agency of Lifton in the confpiracy of Blount did not coft
</p>
<p>him a momentary hiding of the Prefident's face, though a condu^l,
</p>
<p>lefs infidious and dangerous, of a French envoy, had nearly con-
</p>
<p>vulfed two nations.
</p>
<p>The Vice-Prefident (Mr. Jefferfon) was conftantly vilified and
</p>
<p>calumniated in the federal papers and toafts ; but Mr. Adams was
</p>
<p>guarded by a fedition aft. Federal printers rioted on the fpoils of
</p>
<p>republican reputation ; but republican printers were the vidims of
</p>
<p>abufes, of legal perfecutions and often of prifons. Benjamin Frank-
</p>
<p>h'n Bache, editor of the Aurora, whofe fcience and political integ-
</p>
<p>rity would have done honor to any cavife, was the inceflant fubjedt
</p>
<p>f perfecution not only from the truly federal Porcupine and the
</p>
<p>hireling Fenno, * but from every rank of federalifts. His fuccef-
</p>

</p>

<p>f As the unionifts have infilled that Mr. Duane was born in Ireland, I
</p>
<p>take occafion to mention another country, where he was born.  He was born
</p>
<p>in Clinton county, in the {late of New- York, in May 1760. His father died
</p>
<p>there. In May 1765, his mother removed with him to Albany. About the
</p>
<p>year 1774, he went with her to Ireland, where he was married, and for
</p>
<p>fome time edited a paper as a means of fupport. In July 1787 he landed in
</p>
<p>Calcutta, having been previoufly engaged as the editor of the Calcutta Gaz-
</p>
<p>ette. He acquired about ^T. 10,000 fterling in a few years. Being too ardent
</p>
<p>a republican for that country, he was (in Dec 1794) treacheroufly feized,
</p>
<p>put on board an armed fhip and carried to St. Helena, the governor of which
</p>
<p>would not fufFer him to land, buaufe he was not a Britijb fuhjeSi. In England
</p>
<p>he gained no reftitution of his property, which had been taken ; he came to
</p>
<p>America, and is now the editor of the Aurora, to the great annoyance of the
</p>
<p>federalifts ; and he furnilhes fome flationary for a republican Congrefs, which
</p>
<p>-ieems to be an afflidlion to diem, 'Such is the fliort hijftory of a man who has
</p>
<p>ieen born in two countries.

</p>
<p>en, Cooper, Holt and others is well within the public recolkc-
</p>
<p>tioB. Thefe were the days of conciliation I !
</p>
<p>From every quarter were pouring in the nioft fulfome addrefles
</p>
<p>to the Prefident, which were gracioufly anfwered. Wherever he
</p>
<p>faffed, a fervile croud of poHtical clergy, tories, Britifli merchants
</p>
<p>and thorough-going federalifts hailed his triumphal entries and
</p>
<p>were ready to kifs the hem of his garments. This was a proud
</p>
<p>day for every man who hated the revolution. All the power and
</p>
<p>wealth of the country were in federal hands : we had an army, a
</p>
<p>navy, a land-tax, a fedition a6t, an enflaved prefs, and church
</p>
<p>and flate faw its beft days.
</p>
<p>The eledtion of ftate officers in Pennfylvania gave the fir ft alarm
</p>
<p>to federalifm. Republicans had loft their patience ; their latent
</p>
<p>energies were brought into action ; glooms hung over the fcHion
</p>
<p>of Congrefs in 1799  i8co : but, it was too late to retreat: Mr.
</p>
<p>Pinckney was to be fupported as Prefident ; Mr. Adams as Vice-
</p>
<p>Prefident ; but this arrangement was to be concealed. Mr. JeiFer-
</p>
<p>fon was the republican candidate for the Prefidency. The elec-
</p>
<p>tion ball was opened, and the church and ftate unionifts rang all
</p>
<p>their changes upon modern philofophy, iliaminatifm, atheifni and
</p>
<p>anarchy againft Mr. Jefferfon  and upon order, religion, fteady
</p>
<p>habits and good government in favor of Mr. Pinckney. They
</p>
<p>faw fo much horror in having government return iato the hands of
</p>
<p>the right owners, that they wrought themfelves into a frenzy of
</p>
<p>zeal, and though all the meafures of the paft adminiftration ftared
</p>
<p>them in the face, though religion had been outraged, though econ-
</p>
<p>omy had been defpifed, though order had been deftroyed ; yet for
</p>
<p>great men to retire to private life is like annihilation ; for great
</p>
<p>plans to become abortive diftrefiing. Thofe political clergy, whofe
</p>
<p>only hope was in this life, forefaw that of all men they would be
</p>
<p>the moft miferable, if the influence of church and ftate fliould be
</p>
<p>leflened. Could civilians bear to have their favorite fchemes of
</p>
<p>war, wealth and taxation fail ? Could the tories and Britifti mer-
</p>
<p>chants bear to fee a republican Prefident in the chair ?

<p>The army and navy felt the fhock of this crifis, efpecially after
</p>
<p>the refult of the New-York ele^ion was announced. Mr. Adams
</p>
<p>faw the cloud gathering, and refolved on an effort to conciliate
</p>
<p>France. He appointed envoys contrary to the advice of his min-
</p>
<p>ifters : the treaty was effeded ; but it was too late to turn the tide
</p>
<p>of the people. Mr. McHenry fecretary at war, retired from
</p>
<p>oiEce : Mr. Pickering was difmiffed ; but it v;as too late ! the
</p>
<p>meafures of 1798 could not be forgotten nor forgiven.
</p>
<p>Church and ftate in New-England continued to deferve well of
</p>
<p>federalifm even in its laft moments ; for at the fucceeding con-
</p>
<p>grefs, after it was known that the republican candidates had fuc-
</p>
<p>ceeded, its friends eftablifhed a new judiciary, which they coafider-
</p>
<p>ed irremoveable : Mr. Adams continued to make appointments of
</p>
<p>I4S
</p>
<p>ofHcers, who were never to ferve under him  and in the conteft
</p>
<p>of eleftion the unionifts, who pofitively knew that Mr. Jefferfon
</p>
<p>had feventy three votes as Prejident and that -Mr. Burr had not
</p>
<p>one as Prefident, refolved that the voice of the people fhould not
</p>
<p>be heard and that a fair experiment of republicanifm fliould not
</p>
<p>be made, voted more than thirty times for Mr. Burr ! Thefe
</p>
<p>v/ere friends of order and good government ! friends of rehgion
</p>
<p>and fteady habits, and fuch were the aufpicious and melting over-
</p>
<p>tures of conciliation, which were to ufher in the morning of a
</p>
<p>republican admlniftration.
</p>
<p>Mr. JefFerfon's inaugural fpeech, which was principally inten-
</p>
<p>ded as an expofition of his political creed, was conceived in terms
</p>
<p>of perfeft^conciliation. He did not even notice the calumny and
</p>
<p>abufe, which he had fuftered more than any other. The unionills
</p>
<p>afFeded to confider this fpeech as a bond on his part to place full
</p>
<p>confidence in them  to remove none of their number  to difturb
</p>
<p>none of their plans ; but he was to be the nominal prefident "and
</p>
<p>they had made up their minds to be conciliated, if he fhould con-
</p>
<p>dudl according to this expofition. Thefe are the only ideas of
</p>
<p>conciliation, which they ever exhibited and as foon as he made a
</p>
<p>few removals, they called him the negro prefident, the mammoth
</p>
<p>philofopher, renewed their railings and eifayed a reign of terror ;
</p>
<p>but without an army and navy, with no weapons but the tongue
</p>
<p>and pen, their power was fmall. The appointmient of Mr. Gal-
</p>
<p>latin increafed their ravings  every advance of the prefident in his
</p>
<p>labors diftreffed them. The majority againft them appeared for-
</p>
<p>midable ; yet they continued to roar that federalifm was increafing,
</p>
<p>and in a fliort time its increafe v/as from eight (tates down to three.
</p>
<p>The firfl: congrefs, under the new adminiftration, prefented a
</p>
<p>republican majority in both houfes ; the main force of federalifm
</p>
<p>was concentered in the ftates of MafTachufetts, New-Hampfliire
</p>
<p>and Connecticut, and in thefe it would iniliantly have periihed,
</p>

<p>and unlefs we federalilts keep up the bar, v/hich we mercifully

</p>
<p>Teflc6led on the republican members, even Bayard fpoke of them
</p>
<p>as unprincipled inlidels, in whofe hands nothing was fafe and the
</p>
<p>party claimed for themfelves that integrity, intelligence and pa-
</p>
<p>triatifm, which the decifion of their country had loudly denied
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>They had been in the habit of fpeaking contemptuoiifly of re-

<p>piiblicanifc^, of profcribing every term, which exprelfes any per

<p>M9
</p>
<p>tion of our rights and of ridiculing the principles, for which our
</p>
<p>fathers bled. To them a free government appears like anarchy,
</p>
<p>public economy diftradion removal of themfelves, tyranny, re-
</p>
<p>peal of ufelefs eilablifliments, breach of conftitution. They mourn,
</p>
<p>when freemen rejoice. They fee perfe<5t order in the confufion
</p>
<p>of nations, harmony in the horrors of war and n&tional v/eaith in a
</p>
<p>funded debt. To them the finger of heaven feems to point to war,
</p>
<p>when univerfal providence invites to peace. They can difcern
</p>
<p>a free American government in Mr. Adams' balances, morality
</p>
<p>in Hamilton's confeflions, patriotifm in Governeur Morris, piety
</p>
<p>in Bayard and chriftianity in the northern phalanx. After fuch
</p>
<p>vifions we are not to wonder at their abufe of the prefident, their
</p>
<p>abhorrence of Mr. Gallatin, their zeal for taxation and their ven-
</p>
<p>geance againft republicans. Search you a new diftionary, where

<p>words fhall have changed their meaning  Search you a new bible,

<p>The judiciary law was repealed  the federalifts talked of civil
</p>
<p>war, and our church and ftate papers echoed the threat ; but the
</p>
<p>power of " humbling in duft and afhes" had deferted them.
</p>
<p>Nothing remained for federalifts but to improve the prefles to regain
</p>
<p>the ground, which their meafiires had loft. Thefe publiftied, as

<p>the prefident^s meflage, a grofs forgery  they mifreprefented every

<p>View of the proceedings of the loft Sefjion of Congrefs,
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>T is the Tight and the duty of the citizens of a free flate
</p>
<p>to acquire and communicate a corre(5t knowledge of all the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of its government, and as far as poffible, of the princi-
</p>
<p>ples which produced its various afts.
</p>
<p>Whenever a portion of the people are induced by the reprefent-
</p>
<p>ations of influential perfons to deny their confidence to the confti-
</p>
<p>tuted authorities, it is peculiarly neceflary for the friends of the
</p>
<p>government on its part to give publicity to its principles and meaf-
</p>
<p>-^res, and for the people on their part to become acquainted with
</p>
<p>the nature, defign, extent and operation of the raeafures ; that
</p>
<p>Ihey may he enabled to judge from the fyftem and meafures them-
</p>
<p>felves, not from ill-natured and bitter invedlives, what is the true
</p>
<p>character of the adminiflraiion.
</p>
<p>The people at the lad national eletflion repofed their confidence
</p>
<p>in, and elevated to office, men whofe political principles are ma-
</p>
<p>terially different from the principles of thofe gentlemen who com-
</p>
<p>pofed the laft adrainiftration.
</p>
<p>Government is inftitutcd to fecure and increafe the happinefs of
</p>
<p>the people governed. It is the right and property of the public,
</p>
<p>not of its adminiftrators. Therefore whenever the public with-
</p>
<p>hold their confidence from one man and repofe it in another it
</p>
<p>becomes the duty of every good man, as it will be the praftice of
</p>
<p>every good citizen, to yield the fame ready obedience to the laws
</p>
<p>and ordinances of the exifHng authorities as heretofore while the
</p>
<p>perfons in authority were the men of his choice.
</p>
<p>The decided majority which appeared in congrefs during the
</p>
<p>Jafl feflion prove clearly a greater unity oi fentiment, views and
</p>
<p>opinions, than has exiiled at any other period for the iaft ten years.
</p>
<p>Although the federal government and thirteen out of fixteen
</p>
<p>of the ftate governments are united in a fyftem of meafures
</p>
<p>which they believe beft calculated to promote public profperity and

<p>views and principles exifts. This difference produces an oppofition
</p>
<p>to government, headed by difappointedpartizans and fupported by
</p>
<p>perfons well-intentioned but mifinformed. An oppofition which
</p>
<p>attempts to diftradl the councils of the nation and palfy the efforts
</p>
<p>of adminiftration ; which circulates with incredible induftry the
</p>
<p>n)oft unfounded calumnies and fallhocds ; which while in power

</p>
<p>fenting every obftacle in its power with a view to render the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment odious to the people. An adminiftration which labors to

</p>
<p>Among the nations of the earth, it was referved for America .
</p>
<p>to exhibit to the world a government devoted to the intereft of
</p>
<p>of the people ; a government which, inftead of increafing public
</p>
<p>burthens, removed many of thofe heretofore impofed ; which, in-
</p>
<p>llead of enlarging the powers already enjoyed, reftores to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple thofe not effential to be retained ; at the head of which
</p>
<p>prefides a man, who for the promotion of the public good and
</p>
<p>prefervation of civil liberty, folicits the limitation of his own
</p>
<p>powers, the redudlion of his own privileges, and the exercife of
</p>
<p>every conftitutional check to limit the executive will.
</p>
<p>The two hoyfes of congrefs united with the executive in the
</p>
<p>great works of reformation and improvement.
</p>
<p>They have reduced the army to little more than 3000 men,
</p>
<p>who are confidered fufficient to take charge of, and to keep in re-
</p>
<p>paix the various forts of the United States, and hereby have made
</p>
<p>an annual faving to the nation of 522,000 dollars.
</p>
<p>They have reduced a part of the navy eftablifliment, yet retain-
</p>
<p>ed in fervice a fufficient force to humble the Barbary pirates. By
</p>
<p>this redu6lion they have ieflened the public expenditures 200,000
</p>
<p>dollars annually.
</p>
<p>Proceeding on the principle of giving efficient fupport to na-
</p>
<p>tional credit, and of maintaining the national faith and honor in-
</p>
<p>violate, they have carefully compared the amount of every demand
</p>
<p>againfl: government ; the terms of payment ftipulated ; and the
</p>
<p>current expenditures as reduced, with the annual revenue. They
</p>
<p>have found that the annual revenue, exclufive of the internal tax-
</p>
<p>es, exceeds the wants of the nation. They have, therefore, re-
</p>
<p>pealed all the internal taxes.
</p>
<p>As the repeal of thefe taxes has been attributed to a defign to
</p>
<p>pronwte the interefts of one fedion of the union, at the ex-
</p>
<p>pence of another ; a few moments may be well employed in con-
</p>
<p>sidering this fubjedt.

</p>
<p>tion. It was fo abhorrent to the feelings of the people of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, that the houfe of commons once voted to bring to condign
</p>
<p>punifhment certain perfons who charged them with a defign to in-
</p>
<p>troduce it. It was, however, afterwards introduced into the

<p>nation, firft levied on a, few articles, from time to time extended
</p>
<p>to others as the people were found to fubmit to the impofition, un-
</p>
<p>til at lad it embraced almoft every article of convenience and many
</p>
<p>of neceffity.
</p>
<p>So here it commenced with a duty on d^ftilled fpirits ; but in
</p>
<p>the cpurfe of four years was extended to the ordinary fales, for
</p>
<p>confamption, of all fpirits, brandies and wines ; to all fales at

</p>
<p>rooms, the beer for our tables and the fhoes for our feet would
</p>
<p>have been laid under contribution. As it refpeds its effe<5ts on do-
</p>
<p>meftic diftilled fpirits it operates, in the firft inftance, upon two
</p>
<p>defcriptions of perfons :
</p>
<p>I ft. The people who have emigrated from the old fettlements into
</p>
<p>the interior, who encounter all the evils and hardfhips of opening
</p>
<p>the wildernefs, are deprived of the convenience of market towns
</p>
<p>or markets, and who are incapable of fypplying themfelves from
</p>
<p>foreign market, or vending their furplus grains. With them a
</p>
<p>circulating medium is fcarcely known ; their neceffides enforce
</p>
<p>them to refort to the procefs of diftillation to prevent the iofs of
</p>
<p>their furplus crops and furnifh a comfortable beverage.
</p>
<p>The emigrants are highly ufeful to the nation ; they form a
</p>
<p>barrier againft favages ; they extend the fphere of aftion ; their
</p>
<p>emigration prevents a too denfe population, which increafes the
</p>
<p>comforts of thofe left behind. To levy this tax on them is unjuft
</p>
<p>and cruel. They require the foftering hand of a parent, not the
</p>
<p>grafping hand of a tyrant or tax gatherer.
</p>
<p>The middle and eaftern ftates have uniformly cherifhed and aided
</p>
<p>infant fettlements, by freeing them wholly from taxation for a
</p>
<p>confiderable time. The wifdom and policy of the meafure have
</p>
<p>never been doubted.
</p>
<p>2d. Perfons principally refiding in our large towns who enter
</p>
<p>upon diftiliation for the purpofe of acquiring property. The fpirits
</p>
<p>with which they furnifh the market, are derived either from mo-
</p>
<p>lafTes, or from grains, cider, and the like, purchafed of our far-
</p>
<p>mers. So far as they are derived from the diftiliation of molaffes,
</p>
<p>the government derives a revenue from the article, by a duty on
</p>
<p>its importation. So far as the fpirits are derived from articles pro-
</p>
<p>duced in the country, the excife reduces the price of the article,
</p>
<p>and throws the tax upon the farming intereft. When the diftiller

<p>pays government ten cents per gallon on the fpirits he diftillj, he
</p>
<p>will dedudt that tea cents from the price he pays for the portion
</p>
<p>of grain or of liquor it requires to produce the fpirit. By remov-
</p>
<p>ing the excife on diftilled fpirits, government does the moft efficient
</p>
<p>a<51: in its power to furnifti the farmer with a reafonable market.
</p>
<p>The demand of bread in Europe has of late years enabled the
</p>
<p>farmer to fell his produce at a high price, but let peace once vifit
</p>
<p>that quarter of the globe he will find an increafed proportion of the
</p>
<p>monied capital applied to the diftiliation, and by that the price of
</p>
<p>the various kinds of grain will be principally regulated.
</p>
<p>The charge that it favors Virginia and other agricultural ftates,
</p>
<p>to the injury of Maftachufetts and other ftates, is not trus j the
</p>
<p>icport of the fccretary of the treafury, lately publifhed, evinces
</p>
<p>the falfhood of the allegation.
</p>
<p>, Indeed when the excife on diftillcd fpirits was laid, it was con-
</p>
<p>fidered as particularly injurious to the intereft of MafTachufetts.
</p>
<p>Mr. Daltcn and governor Strong both voted againfl the bill. 
</p>
<p>Thus it appears by the journals of the fenate.
</p>
<p>Congrefs were induced to repeal thefe taxes, from the following
</p>
<p>confiderations :  That the remaining revenues of government
</p>
<p>were equal to its neceffities ; that it would be an equal and great
</p>
<p>relief to the people, not only as it enabled them to apply the
</p>
<p>amount of the monies, fay 900,000 dollars, yearly to their private
</p>
<p>life ; but as it would free them from the lofs of time and expence
</p>
<p>which was neceflarijy required in travelling to and from the vari-
</p>
<p>ous offices to furnifli them with licenfes and (lamp paper, and to
</p>
<p>make their payments. The difference in the confumption of the
</p>
<p>citizens' time and money in the colledion of the external and in-
</p>
<p>ternal revenues is immenfe. The firfl: is limited to a very few com-
</p>
<p>mercial ports where the merchants and officers refide. The latter
</p>
<p>extends to every portion of the union. It operates more or lefs
</p>
<p>in every town, village and fettlement. The fyftem itfe.lf creates
</p>
<p>an embarraffment on bufinefs ; not unfrequently the expence of
</p>
<p>procuring the licenfe on paper is equal to the whole revenue de-
</p>
<p>rived from it.
</p>
<p>That the expence of fjpporting the various officers employed
</p>
<p>in coliefting it, confumes more than twenty dollars out of every
</p>
<p>hundred dollars collefted, and amounts to 180,000 dollars yearly,
</p>
<p>every cent of which is faved to the people by abolifhing the fyftem :
</p>
<p>While the duties on imported articles do not require an expence
</p>
<p>of more than five dollars on a hundred dollars paid.
</p>
<p>That the fyftem, by creating a vaft number of officers, had a
</p>
<p>tendency to increafe the power and patronage of the executive fo
</p>
<p>far, that it might become, 'if i( had not already heen^ dangerous to
</p>
<p>the liberties of the country.
</p>
<p>That experience had fnewn governments to have been expenflve
</p>
<p>and extravagant in proportion to the means they pofllffied. It was

</p>
<p>therefore both juft and politic to furrender and yield up to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, that portion of revenue which was not neceifary to the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. That this furrender ought to confilt of thofe taxes which
</p>
<p>were moft obnoxious ; which nioft embarrafled the ordinary pur-
</p>
<p>fults of the people, and which were of political afpeft the moft
</p>
<p>fufpicious : and that the hiftory of the nations who have gone be-
</p>
<p>fore us evinces this truth. That a fyftem of excife when once ef-
</p>
<p>tablifhed is ufually extended from article to article, until it is
</p>
<p>applied to all the comforts and conveniencies of life and moft of
</p>
<p>its neccflities, when it finks the body of the nation into wretched-
</p>
<p>nefs and poverty. Confidering the conditions of the perfons upon
</p>
<p>whom the carriage tax operated, it appears in fome meafure defira-
</p>
<p>ble to continue that tax ; but when it was confidered that it pro-
</p>
<p>duced only 77,874 dollars and 41 cents, that it could not be con-
</p>
<p>tinued without employing a vaft corps of officers at an expenfe
</p>
<p>equal, or nearly equal to the tax, thereby preferving the feeds of
</p>
<p>another general excife fyftem, the policy of the government forbade
</p>
<p>its continuance. It has been faid by oppofition, that the repeal of
</p>
<p>thefe taxes only operated to relieve the more wealthy ; leaving the
</p>
<p>poor under the whole prefTure of all their former bur'Miens : That
</p>
<p>if the finances of the nation admitted a rediicflion, the duty on
</p>
<p>fait, bohea tea, and brown fugar, ought to be diminifhed. Yet
</p>
<p>they and their friends were the perfons who levied the duties on
</p>
<p>thefe articles, two years before they levied any excife. They have
</p>
<p>from time to time increafed the duties on the fame articles. The
</p>
<p>ftrft duty on fait was fix cents per bufhel ; they increafed it to
</p>
<p>twelve cents ; on tea it was ten cents per pound ; they increafed it
</p>
<p>to twelve cents. It was one cent per pound on fugar, they increaf-
</p>
<p>ed it to two. Thefe duties they made perpetual, that is to fay,
</p>
<p>to continue until a majority of both houfes of congrefs and the
</p>
<p>prefident or two thirds of both houfes agree to remove them.
</p>
<p>The internal taxes, whatever might be their wifhcs, they did not
</p>
<p>venture, until after the eledion of Mr. Jefferfon, to make pei^-
</p>
<p>petual. Thefe taxes were temporary, and moft of them would
</p>
<p>have expired before this day, had not the defire of the party to
</p>
<p>preferve the trappings of monarchy induced them to pafs the law
</p>
<p>of the 25th of February, 1801, by which they were made perpet-
</p>
<p>ual. To fatisfy the public that the defign of the oppofition in
</p>
<p>objeaing to the repeal of the internal taxes was folely to embarrafs
</p>
<p>government, and not to relieve the poor (who while they ufe it
</p>
<p>with moderation, are as much comforted by fpirits as by tea or
</p>
<p>fugar) ; it is proper to examine their condu<5l while in power, a
</p>
<p>little more minutely. Inftead of lefTening the duties on thefe
</p>
<p>articles, in the month of February, 1797? when they had the
</p>
<p>benefit of the knowledge of the operation of the duties for more
</p>
<p>than fix years, they increafed them. Every member of congrefs

<p>from New-Hampfhire, and every member prefent from Maffachu-
</p>
<p>fetts (excepting William Lyman) voted in favor of that meafure.
</p>
<p>At the fame feilion a law was paffed granting relief to diftillers,
</p>
<p>by removing the duties from the amount of fpirits- and fixing it on
</p>
<p>the capacity of the flill. Every member from the ftates of New-
</p>
<p>Hampfhire, Maffachufetts, and Connedicut voted in favor of
</p>
<p>this law. Thefe fa6ts appear from the journals of congrefs.
</p>
<p>Here, people of New- England, is a juft view of your repre-
</p>
<p>fentatives, who would induce you to believe that the government
</p>
<p>of the country was facrificing its intered at the {hrin.e of Vir>
</p>
<p>ginia's ambition.
</p>
<p>J>Sf
</p>
<p>It has been faid that found policy required the application o(
</p>
<p>thefe taxes to the difcharge of the national debt. To this it is
</p>
<p>anfwered ; maintain the prefent economical eftablifhment, the fur-
</p>
<p>plus funds arifing from the remaining revenues will pay the debt as
</p>
<p>foon as congrefs have by law a right to pay it, and the exorbitaDt
</p>
<p>expence of colle6ling the excife will be avoided.
</p>
<p>It has been faid by the oppofition, that thefe taxes are repealed
</p>
<p>and the duties on imported articles continued with a view to deftroy
</p>
<p>commerce. Let the commercial intereft reflect. There is not
</p>
<p>an additional cent impofed on commerce. As the taxes of the
</p>
<p>nation are lefTened, the ability of the people to pay is increafed.
</p>
<p>Let it be reminded with what promptitude the trade of the Medi-
</p>
<p>terranean was protected. That government has completed a
</p>
<p>treaty with Great- Britain whereby our merchants are enabled to
</p>
<p>recover their loil property, and continue in the enjoyment of com-
</p>
<p>mercial enterprize ; above all, that government relying folely on
</p>
<p>commerce for her revenue, (lands pledged by intereft, the ftrong-
</p>
<p>efl: of all ties, to cherifli and fupport it. The removal of the in-
</p>
<p>ternal taxes, fo far from evincing hoftility to commerce, furnifhes
</p>
<p>proof next to demonflration of a determination on the part of
</p>
<p>the government to fupport it.
</p>
<p>To clofe the remarks on this fubjed, it has been faid, the re
</p>
<p>peal of thefe taxes was defigned as a blov/ to the funds, and was
</p>
<p>^prelude to extinguifhing the national debt with a fpunge.
</p>
<p>Nothing can be more unfounded than this afperfion. The pay-
</p>
<p>ments are made with punfluality.
</p>
<p>The government has by a law of this feflion appropriated
</p>
<p>7,300,000 dollars annually towards the difcharge of her debts :
</p>
<p>the funds in the market are worth twelve per cent, more than they
</p>
<p>were during the laft adminiftration.
</p>
<p>Does the creditor's confidence in his debtor increafe in propor-
</p>
<p>tion, to the debtor's extravagance and diffipation ? Does a man's
</p>
<p>living beyond his income furniili the belt evidence of his renxaining
</p>
<p>able to pay his debts ? Does a debtor forfeit all claims to confi-

<p>dence by uniting rigid economy with a conftant attention to bufi-
</p>
<p>nefs ?
</p>
<p>Congrefs have repealed the adl pafTed in February, 1801, ef-
</p>
<p>tciblifhing fix new circuit courts and limiting the labours of the
</p>
<p>judges of the fupreme court to the holding of two feflions in a
</p>
<p>year at the feat of government ; and, by another afl, have rem-
</p>
<p>edied the evils of the former fyftem, by fpeci Tying the diftridts in
</p>
<p>which each judge of the fupreme court (liould hold a circuit court,
</p>
<p>and difpenfing with one fefiion of the fupreme court : by this they
</p>
<p>have effected an annual faving of 33,000 dollars and abolifhed fix-
</p>
<p>teen ufelefs offices.
</p>
<p>The meafure was objected to, both as unconftitutional and im-
</p>
<p>politic. As 10 the coniUtutionality of the meafure, the diflinvt'on
</p>
<p>exi/ls between the fupreme and the fubordlnatc eourts. The for-
</p>
<p>mer is created by the conftltution ; the latter by, and fubje<5t to,
</p>
<p>Jegiflative difcretion. One may be abohflied  the other cannpt.
</p>
<p>The objedion, that this dodrine deftroys the judicial department,
</p>
<p>by engulphing it in the vortex of party, is unfounded. The judg-
</p>
<p>es are not fubjed: to the will of the executive, or even of the ler
</p>
<p>giflature. No new fyftem is eftablifhed, by which a new corps of
</p>
<p>judges is created. The adminiflration of juftice is entrufted, as it
</p>
<p>has heretofore been, to the judges of the fupreme court, whoi^
</p>
<p>independence has not been affeded, or ever controverted. The
</p>
<p>right to create and abolifli inferior courts has heretofore been aer
</p>
<p>knowledged by the legiflatures of New-Hampfhire, MafTachufetts,
</p>
<p>Pennfylvania, Maryland and Virginia, who have fimilar conftitUr
</p>
<p>tions ; and no legiflature ever adopted a contrary conftru<^ion.
</p>
<p>As to the policy of the meafure, the only queftions are, whether
</p>
<p>the fix judges will be able to perform the fervice ; and whether an
</p>
<p>anfiual feffion of the fupreme court is fufficient.
</p>
<p>To decide upon the ability of the judges to perform the fervice,
</p>
<p>let us confider the labours of one judge ; judge Cufhing, for in-
</p>
<p>ftance. The law requires him to hold annually, in conjunction
</p>
<p>with the diftriil judges, two feffion s of a circuit court in each of
</p>
<p>the dates of New-Hamplhire, MafTachufetts, and Rhode-Ifiand.
</p>
<p>Ten days may fairly be computed the full length of a feffion. The
</p>
<p>courts will then require fixty days. His travel, in going to and
</p>
<p>returning from thofe courts, cannot exceed 430 miles ; which,
</p>
<p>allowing one day for each twenty, amounts to twenty-four days
</p>
<p>more. A feffion of the fupreme court will not require more thaa
</p>
<p>twenty-one days. His refidence does not exceed 480 miles dif-
</p>
<p>tance trom the feat of government. As the above moderate rat*
</p>
<p>of travelling, there mull be added 48 days more, making the
</p>
<p>whole time, while on expence and in public fervice, 153 days, or
</p>
<p>a little over five months ; for which he receives 3500 dollars in
</p>
<p>each year : A lefs portion of time than he devoted to the public
</p>
<p>fervice while a judge of the ftate courts of MafTachufetts. As to
</p>
<p>the fufficiency of an annual fupreme court, it cannot be doubted,

<p>when it is known that, for ten years, that court decided but forty-
</p>
<p>three caufes : and that, at its laft feffion, the dockets confifted of
</p>
<p>eight only ; three of which were decided.
</p>
<p>AfTuming the faft, that there will be neither a greater or lefs
</p>
<p>number of caufes before the fupreme court, for ten years to come,
</p>
<p>than there was for the firfl ten years after its eftabliflinient : and
</p>
<p>there appears no reafonable ground on which to calculate for an
</p>
<p>increafe of bufinefs ; It is eafy to fee what the comparifon was,
</p>
<p>between the fervices to be rendered, and the compenfation made
</p>
<p>according to the provifions of the ad repealed at the laft feffion of
</p>
<p>congrefs.
</p>
<p>The falaries allowed by law to the judges of t-iat court amount
</p>
<p>If.
</p>
<p>annually, to 21,500 dollars ; of courfe, in ten years, 10215,000
</p>
<p>dollars. The falaries of the clerks, for the fame time, is 2300
</p>
<p>dollars. Total amount of falaries, for ten years, is 217,300 dol-
</p>
<p>lars. In the courfe of ten years, 43 caufes only were decided, as
</p>
<p>appears by the reports of Dallas. By this it is manifefl;, that un-
</p>
<p>der the laft federal judiciary fyftem, which was repealed at the laft:
</p>
<p>feffion of congrefs, the people of the United States would pay
</p>
<p>more than 5053 dollars for each decifion. Does that man tx'iil
</p>
<p>who will fay, the public money (hould be thus fquandered ?
</p>
<p>A revifion of the laws relating to naturalization has alfo taken
</p>
<p>place. The aft of 1798 is repealed, and the former law revived;
</p>
<p>by which a refidence of five years ffntitles a foreigner, of good
</p>
<p>conduct and reputation, to the rights of citizenfhip.
</p>
<p>The juftice due to a large number of people, who emigrated
</p>
<p>under the faith of exifting laws, and the policy of opening the wil-
</p>
<p>deriiefs and acquiring the arts and manufactures of Europe, requir-
</p>
<p>ed this revifion. It is only a revival of the WalTiington fyllem.
</p>
<p>Gongrefs have continued to the officers, refiding at the feat of
</p>
<p>government, the compenfation they enjoyed under the a<5l of 1 799.
</p>
<p>This has been the fubjed of much newfpaper abufe ; it has been .
</p>
<p>falfely reprefented as an augmentation of falaries.
</p>
<p>The government has been charged with a departure from eco-
</p>
<p>nomical principles ; and thofe gentlemen who fupported the mea-
</p>
<p>fure but oppofed the grant in 1799, have been charged with incon-
</p>
<p>fiffency. Thefe charges will not be accredited, when it is known
</p>
<p>that the expence of living is confiderably higher at the feat of gov-
</p>
<p>ernment than at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>To prove the fafl, it is only neceffary to refort to the ads of the
</p>
<p>late federal, and of the laft feflion of congrefs.
</p>
<p>The ad of 1799 afcertained, as well the compenfation of the
</p>
<p>clerks as of the officers. When the offices were removed to
</p>
<p>Wafhington, the increafed expence of living rendered it neceffary
</p>
<p>to augment the compenfation of the clerks. They were accor-
</p>

<p>per cent expired laft winter : it was revived. Here is the con-
</p>
<p>current teftimony of both parties uniting in this propofition, there
</p>
<p>is a difference of fifteen per cent, in the price of livmg. To cov-
</p>
<p>er this difference of expenditure, the falaries of 1799 were eftab-
</p>
<p>lifhed for two years. In fad, there was not a member of the op-
</p>
<p>pofition who contended that the falaries were too high.
</p>
<p>To facilitate the progrefs of information and private intercourfe,
</p>
<p>an increafed expenditure of the revenue of the general poff-office
</p>
<p>has been authorized ; both to enfure the more fafe and expeditious
</p>
<p>tranfportation of the mail, and to extend the benefits of the edab-
</p>
<p>lifliment to the inhabitants refiding upon or near almoft fixty new
</p>
<p>effablifhed pofi-roads. It was propofed to remove the poffage
</p>
<p>from newfpaptrs. The danger of retarding the progrefs of the
</p>
<p>^59
</p>
<p>inalls, and deftroying country preiTes, prevented the adoption of
</p>
<p>this meafure. This poftage is not a tax. It does not amount to
</p>
<p>one fourth part of the monies expended, in their conveyance^ by
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>In addition to thefe meafurjes, the compenfations of the collec-
</p>
<p>tors of the revenue have been reduced. This has efFedled an an-
</p>
<p>nual faving of about 17,000 dollars.
</p>
<p>The prompt and ready payment of the public monies, and the
</p>
<p>eventual refponfibility of the officers of government, have been fe-
</p>
<p>cured by an adl declaring, that each bond ftiall be a lien on tlie real
</p>
<p>eftates of both principal and furety, and (hail be renewed once in
</p>
<p>four years.
</p>
<p>The objed of every grant of money has been fpecified with ac^
</p>
<p>curacy and precifion, to enfure its juft application, and to limit
</p>
<p>the powers of executive officers^ as far as poiTible.
</p>
<p>The danger of war with the favages has been removed, by provi-
</p>
<p>ding for a general ellablifhment of our boundary lines and for a due
</p>
<p>regulation of the intercourfe between this nation and the tribes.
</p>
<p>And lajlly^ The people of the territory northweft of the river
</p>
<p>Ohio have been elevated co the rank of freemen and the confe-
</p>
<p>quent blellings of felf government, by an ait authorizing them to
</p>

<p>Tliele redudions are of two kinds, ift. Of expenditures which

<p>the eftimate, in afcertaining our yearly burdens, or in forming an

<p>ereding and repairing fortifications, the appropriations for the fup-

<p>the current year have been kffencd about 170,000 dollars.

<p>Of thefe expenditures, from the peace eftablilhrnent of the late

<p>I
</p>
<p>N this part have been prefented two clafTes of men and
</p>
<p>two fpecies of governments, with (hort views of two adminiftrations,
</p>
<p>A doubt cannot reft in the public mind which of thefe has con-
</p>
<p>formed to the fpirit of our revolution* The prefent government
</p>
<p>W
</p>
<p>l62
</p>
<p>is not To perfedly republican, as it would have been under the
</p>
<p>fame men, provided their adminiftration had immediately fucceed-
</p>
<p>ed the revolution. The evils of part ariftocratic meafures will at-
</p>
<p>tend us to the laft moment of our national exiftence.
</p>
<p>If the principles of a republican government are in their nature
</p>
<p>oppofed to the tempers of our unionifts, we will not be furprized
</p>
<p>that their meafures have difcoversd their abhorrence of them, and
</p>
<p>in return they will not be furprized that we charge them with con-
</p>
<p>fpiring againif fuch a government. They did every thing but levy
</p>
<p>a civil war againft republicans. Franklin could eafier fnatch the
</p>
<p>lightning from heaven and the fceptre from tyrants, than he could
</p>
<p>extrad from the unionifts any portion of their vengeance againft
</p>
<p>our caufe. Jefferfon could eafier enlighten a world with moral
</p>
<p>and political fcience than he could turn the heart of one of our
</p>
<p>unionifts. The invincible obftinacy and bltternefs of northern fe-
</p>
<p>deralifm have never been thoroughly realized by men, who have
</p>
<p>lived in countries where reafon and toleration have a reftdence. Re-
</p>
<p>ligious bigotry, entwined for centuries with family ariftocracies,
</p>
<p>produces powerful effefts.
</p>
<p>I had intended to have prefented all the names of our leading
</p>
<p>unionifts, with fafts ftiewing their conne<5tion with the union and
</p>
<p>the profits which each derived from the connection  and to have
</p>
<p>entertained the reader with fome extra(5ts from political fermons and

<p>imprellions, contrary to known truth. It is often queftioned,
</p>
<p>whether this or that charge againft Preftdent Jefferfon is well
</p>
<p>founded. Is it not enough that he has ftood like a rock againft
</p>
<p>every attack, and that all the force of church and ftate was unable
</p>
<p>to deprive him of his election ? Is it not enough that he has conti-
</p>
<p>nued for more than a year to offer the olive-branch to men, who
</p>
<p>were aiming to wound him mortally ? When you hear merchants*
</p>
<p>and attornies' clerks calling him names and abufmg him, can it be
</p>
<p>worth your while to exert yourfelves to perfuade their mafters that
</p>
<p>he deferves his ftation ? His charatfter is not put in iffue to a federal
</p>
<p>jury : it is fubmitted to the decifion of an impartial public. The

<p>political clergy and their affociates cannot aad willjlQti tell Uie truth

<p>rU fer^eralifts would prejudiee republicanifm, becaufe Biiona-
</p>
<p>pW is concentering the powers of ariftocracies in a confulate for
</p>
<p>life ; but does this prove their cafe ? He has ouly done on a large
</p>
<p>fcale fuddenly what they did on a fmall fcale gradually. He is
</p>
<p>trying conciliation with the Pope of Rome, with the emigrants, with
</p>
<p>the kings, and he will foon have a funding fyftem and treaties, and
</p>
<p>^vill go the grand round of the paffions ; but as foon as the people
</p>
<p>{hall difcover that the ir revolution is defpifed and that the leaders
</p>
<p>are feeking perfonal glory at their 2xpence, they will have a new
</p>
<p>adminiftration, and the French repubUc will be the wonder of the
</p>
<p>world. Their unionifts, civil and ccclefiaftlcal, who are now
</p>
<p>rifing up like the, plagues of Egypt, will oppofe the new order of
</p>
<p>things, will call it atheifm and anarchy ; but their defeat will be as
</p>
<p>certain as that the great God never caufed a million of men to b eed
</p>
<p>in order to produce fuch a miferable effea: as placing ><apoIeon
</p>
<p>Buonaparte on the throne of France in the room of Lewis Capet. ^

<p>Men, who play their liitle paffions againft the manireft order ot
</p>
<p>thincTs, againft the ftate of fociety, and againft the temper and m-
</p>
<p>terefts of a fovereign people, may be full of brilliant profpefts for a
</p>
<p>feafon ; but will be as furely defeated as infeds, who fliould at-
</p>
<p>tempt to retard the revolution of the earth. Small portions of
</p>
<p>earth may be eafily conveyed from eaft to weft ; but the great globe
</p>
<p>will revolve, and republicans (who have been called athCifts) as
</p>
<p>fully expea that this country will, under divme guidance, conti-
</p>
<p>nue to be a republic that France will be a republic that the re-
</p>
<p>publican principle will prevail that kings will lofe their crowns
</p>
<p>that civil and religious liberty are to prevail, and that the work ot
</p>
<p>emancipation is begun, as that the earth will contmue to revolve.
</p>
<p>After a revolution the patriot paufes to lament over the wa te ot

<p>blood and treafure, and over the fate of his friends, who did not

<p>that fuch tyrannies foon expire hy reafon of their cwti energies. 1 hey

<p>formed an alliance offenfive and defenfive, the fpirit of a free peo-
</p>
<p>ple rifes and fcatters them to all the winds of heaven : but they will
</p>
<p>rally again, and the only fecurity for republicans is, that the princi-
</p>
<p>ples of popular fovereignty and political equality be well underftood
</p>
<p>by the people, that the claffes of men, who are hoftile to them,
</p>
<p>fhould be diftinaly known, and that the arts of delufion, by which
</p>
<p>they maybe defeated, be thoroughly apprehended.
</p>
<p>FederaHfts pretend that we are oppofed to colleges, merely be-
</p>
<p>caufe we are unwilling to have tho poifon ot fcderaUfm mfufed iuta
</p>
<p>the minds of youth, who are preparing for p^iHic (Vations  that we
</p>
<p>are oppofed to rich men, becaufe we are unwilling to have ariftocra-
</p>
<p>cies of wealth, politically afTociated for our ruitt  that we are oppo-
</p>
<p>fed to all the clergy, merely becaufe we are unwilling to nurfe a
</p>
<p>clerical ariftocracy -that we are oppofed to great men, becaufe we
</p>
<p>are unwilling to have them formed into folid columns to deftroy the
</p>
<p>body of the people. Here it may be proper to explain. We haye
</p>
<p>great men in our adminiftration ; but their greatnefs is, during their
</p>
<p>continuance in office, depofited with the people, to be forfeited, in
</p>
<p>cafe they violate their trufts. They came into office on terms and
</p>
<p>profeffions, and they are bound to the whole amount of their great-
</p>
<p>nefs to be true to republican principles. This was not the cafe with
</p>
<p>the iaft adminiftration : without any profeffions to the people, they
</p>
<p>were bound, to the amount of all their pride and paffions, to make
</p>
<p>great treaties, to adopt great plans, to incur enormous expenfes, to
</p>
<p>glorify themfclves and to himible in duft and afl-^es the people  and
</p>
<p>never did a clafs of men work more faithfully. The annals of 1 798
</p>
<p>will bear witnefs of their induftry !
</p>
<p>But what is New-England church andflate now doing ? They
</p>
<p>are fending a regular fupply of miffionariestocongrefs to oppofe eve-
</p>
<p>ry raeafure of admioiftration, and in this way to make a fair experi-
</p>
<p>ment of a republican government I and they have decided, previous
</p>
<p>to fuch experiment, that republicanifm is deteflable and th?.t the
</p>
<p>old order of things is to be refloied, and from this they pretend
</p>
<p>to exped religion. Surely if it be tjiat religion, which was exhib-
</p>
<p>ited under Mr. Adams' adminlftiaticn, not one chrilVian ever wi(h-
</p>
<p>ed to fee it. But who are the leading agents in fending thefe men ?
</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL CLERGY ? And what pIous feleftlon of men have

<p>very pious fet of chriftians ! " You calculate well. If your^s was

<p>not the (landing order, the numerous difturbances among ymi would
</p>
<p>drive off multitudes to churches, where the prayers would be at
</p>
<p>leaft unexceptionable, and where there is no hazard of being infult-

<p>ed by political profanations of the Sabbath. Ep'Tcopal churches
</p>
<p>and baptift meeting houfes would abound, and political clergy
</p>
<p>would afFed to wonder at the figns of the times.
</p>
<p>The different orders, which have always been humbled in New-
</p>
<p>England, have a right to afTert their corporate {landing, and
</p>
<p>united with the republicans they have ftrength enough to do it.
</p>
<p>Thefe lad profefs to wifh fuch an event, becaufe this union has

<p>been deftrudive to free fuffrage, to liberty and to that portion of

<p>But another clafs of men is ftrongly Interefted in this fubjedl,
</p>
<p>viz. the tens of thoufands of our brethren, who have no more
</p>
<p>voice in our councils than the black flaves in the Indies ; men of
</p>
<p>full age and capacity, Induftrious, intelligent, ufeful members of
</p>
<p>fociety, who hap}:en not to have property enough to entitle
</p>
<p>them to a vote. Thefe the bleilings of our independence
</p>
<p>have never reached. They never enjoyed a reprefentative govern-

</p>
<p>:ixcs on heads and lands. The ariftocracy of our colleges can
</p>
<p>burft through the forms of law, and diplomas take rank of labor ;
</p>
<p>but the cunning federaliil will be careful never to raife an ariftocra-
</p>
<p>cy from the plough and the hammer.
</p>
<p>Thofe mafons in New-England, who a6l with the unionifts, are
</p>
<p>not doing great honor to their craft by aflociating with the Robifon
</p>
<p>and Barruel terrorills. ^
</p>
<p>Thofe chrgy, who wifli to lead their people Zionwards, would
</p>
<p>do well to leave federal tracks, becaufe in every nation thev have
</p>
<p>led to another couritvy.
</p>
<p>There is but a fmall number of men in New-England, whofe
</p>
<p>intereft is tven partially on ^he ffdera! fide. Thef- are the politic-
</p>
<p>i66
</p>
<p> -'  ^' '^
</p>
<p>al clergy and federal civilians, whofe unmefciful abufe of repub-
</p>
<p>licans has led them beyond retreating ground- We Jhould anchor
</p>
<p>ihefe at head andjlern, lejl they come round to our fide y for their de-
</p>
<p>pravity is total, their influence is ivholly undejirable. To thefe men
</p>
<p>are joined a clafs of worldly chriftians, who fee no chance of
</p>
<p>profit or promotion but by their infliience : add to thefe their fub-
</p>
<p>alterns and the leaders of thofe ariftocracles, which always aim
</p>
<p>at the deftrudlion of freedom. Tyranny is uniform, its favorites
</p>
<p>are few and none but the leaders even of arillocracies can boaft
</p>
<p>of its fmiles.
</p>
<p>Church and ftate are fubtle : they will pretend that they are
</p>
<p>gaining ftrength even in the midft of debility : but their ftrength
</p>
<p>will be that of convulfions. They will precede your ele6lions
</p>
<p>with falfe reports of forced loans and augmented falaries or fome
</p>
<p>others equally falfe and to their pfrpofe  they will abufe republi-
</p>
<p>can candidates  they will intimidate the weak  they may reduce
</p>
<p>us for a feafon : but we begin to work with folid capital  the re-
</p>
<p>publicans, who a<5l with us openly, will be conftant  thofe, who
</p>
<p>are oppofed to us., mud be knowingly oppofed to the government of
</p>
<p>a majority and to every general principle, which their leaders for-
</p>
<p>merly taught".
</p>
<p>Their caufe, their pafl: means, their certain duplicity are fo ma-
</p>
<p>ny arguments that they mud fail. The political clergy
</p>
<p>ARE THE WORST ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH. ThE FEDERAL
</p>
<p>LEADERS ARE THE WORST ENEMIES OF OUR REVOLUTION, AND
</p>
<p>BOTH ARE ENEMIES TO THE COMMON PEOPLE.
</p>
<p>This declaration is not the fentiment of one man only, but of
</p>
<p>many thoufands in New-England, whofe united force and refponii-
</p>
<p>bility will be competent to its defence.
