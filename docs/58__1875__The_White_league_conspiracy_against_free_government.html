<p>THE WHITE LEAGUE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>AGAINST FREE UOVERNMENT.
</p>
<p>^^v^'ASH^^^;' /
</p>
<p>We print in full in this morning's Republican the able speech of
</p>
<p>General Hugh J. Campbell, delivered in Union Chapel on Monday
</p>
<p>evening last. This speech is a manly and bold exposition of the
</p>
<p>causes which have led to our present unhappy political position, and
</p>
<p>is substantiated by an irresistible array of facts and figures. As an
</p>
<p>oratorical effort it was one of the best of the General's life, and he
</p>
<p>was listened to by his large audience with undivided attention, and
</p>
<p>was greeted with frequent burst of applause. General Campbell is
</p>
<p>a speaker of gi-eat force, and his efforts are always fortified with a
</p>
<p>strong showing of facts. We have as yet seen no attempt to dis-
</p>
<p>prove any of the grave assertions which he last Monday evening
</p>
<p>made concerning the acts and plans of the revolutionary party in
</p>
<p>this State. We commend this speech of General Campbell's to our
</p>
<p>readers as a valuable addition to current political literature.

</p>
<p>THE WHITE LEAGUE CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>AGAINST FREE GOVERNMENT.
</p>
<p>SPEECH OF GENERAL HUGH J. CAMPBELL,
</p>
<p>On Monday Eoening, January 11, 1875, before a Republican Mass
</p>
<p>Meeting, held in Bethel Chapel, for the purpose of giving
</p>
<p>the sense of the Republicans of Louisiana as to the
</p>
<p>correctness of the facts stated in Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Sheridan's dispatches.
</p>
<p>Mr. Pbesident and Fellow Citizebjs  I thank yon for the honor
</p>
<p>yon have conferred upon me in asking me to address you at this
</p>
<p>time. I appear before you with the most solemn impression that
</p>
<p>we are now standing at the critical point in the fortunes of Repub-
</p>
<p>licanism in the Southern States. The destinies of the Republican
</p>
<p>party, and with them those of fhe colored people, and with them
</p>
<p>those of the white people of this State and of the South, who have
</p>
<p>been the supporters of the Republican party, are now in the scale,
</p>
<p>and the scale is literally trembling on its balance. At this very
</p>
<p>hour, while I am speaking to you, the people of this Union, in every
</p>
<p>city, town and village ; and in every capital of the States, and every
</p>
<p>legislative hall; in the capital of the nation itself, and in the halls of
</p>
<p>Congress, are solemnly, and with intense excitement, deliberating
</p>
<p>upon the question whether there is anything in Republicanism at
</p>
<p>the South worthy of preserving it to the nation. They are every-
</p>
<p>where asking the question to-night: If there are ninety thou-
</p>
<p>sand Republican voters in Louisiana, what is the reason that the
</p>
<p>election of 1812 has so long been in doubt? "What is the reason
</p>
<p>that, ou the fourteenth of September last, three thousand men, with
</p>
<p>arms in their hands, in thirty minutes, overthrew your State govern-
</p>
<p>ment and all its forces, and drove your State officials into the Cus-
</p>
<p>tomhouse for protection ? What is the reason that at the recent

</p>
<p>election it is now claimed by the Democrats that they carried it, and
</p>
<p>carried it by virtue of negro votes, and that thousands of colored
</p>
<p>men are said by them to have voted the White League ticket?" It is
</p>
<p>just at this critical juncture that one man, independent in position
</p>
<p>and character, with the intuition of genius aud the force of a
</p>
<p>strong and well balanced mind, has gone right straight to
</p>
<p>the heart of the question and answered it  "Banditti." [Loud
</p>
<p>applause and long cheers.] That word contains the whole answer;
</p>
<p>it sums up the volume of eight years of bloodshed, anarchy,
</p>
<p>massacre and murder. In giving the wings of language to that
</p>
<p>term, in hurling it like a thunderbolt at the heads of the guilty,
</p>
<p>coming from his lips as it did, clothed with all the authority and
</p>
<p>majesty of the solemn oflBcial declaration of the second military offi-
</p>
<p>cer in rank in the nation; of one of the historical military heroes of
</p>
<p>our national history; of one of the eight or ten names which
</p>
<p>stand at the topmost line on the scroll of the world's greatest mili-
</p>
<p>tary names. General Philip H. Sheridan, has uttered the most fear-
</p>
<p>ful indictment against a part of the people of this State which has
</p>
<p>ever been found against any civilized community. Not only through
</p>
<p>every town and village, not only through every great city, not only
</p>
<p>in Washington and in Congress, but in Paris, London, Amsterdam,
</p>
<p>Rome, Berlin, Vienna, and in every civilized capital of the globe has
</p>
<p>this terrific indictment been read, pondered and judicially weighed.
</p>
<p>[Applause.] It is to the facts of historical record which none can
</p>
<p>dii=ipute and which every one knows, upon which this indictment
</p>
<p>of General Sheridan is based, that I wish to address myself now.
</p>
<p>NINE MASSACBES IN EIGHT TEARS.
</p>
<p>From 1866 to the present time there have been nine great
</p>
<p>butcheries or massacres for political reasons in the State of Louisi-
</p>
<p>ana. I give you the list. In 1866, 200 persons were killed, and
</p>
<p>1 60 were tftken wounded to the Marine Hospital, and this is not
</p>
<p>counting those dead and wounded whose bodies were carted away
</p>
<p>by the authorities and dumped in some unknown places. At that
</p>
<p>massacre, I have the authority of a surgeon in the United States
</p>
<p>army now on duty in this city for stating that, after these 160
</p>
<p>wounded were taken to the Marine Hospital, the perpetrators of the
</p>

</p>
<p>massacre, standing in line on the New canal, fired volleys into the
</p>
<p>hospital itself, the marks of whose bullets were for a long time
</p>
<p>visible on the walls.
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>officials of Lincoln parish, two of whom held appointments under
</p>
<p>the United States, and their murder in cold blood. Not a solitary-
</p>
<p>conservative newspaper in this State has denounced this atrocity,
</p>
<p>while several of them have boldly and repeatedly applauded and in-
</p>
<p>dorsed it. Advice of the most sanguinary character and the most
</p>
<p>revolutionary lawlessness was given from week to week in the col-
</p>
<p>umns of the principal newspapers of the State. The Picayune on
</p>
<p>the sixteenth of September advised that any white man found ad-
</p>
<p>dressing colored people as I am addressing you should be "shot
</p>
<p>down like a dog in his tracks." The Bulletin threatened United States
</p>
<p>soldiers and officers with torn uniforms and punched heads should
</p>
<p>they interfere with the White Leaguers in their operations, and quoted
</p>
<p>with approval the resistance to the United States troops in Tennes-
</p>
<p>see. The Shreveport Times advocated over and over the murder of
</p>
<p>every Eepublican official who should be found elected by the return-
</p>
<p>ing officers against the decrees of the White Leaguers, and its chief
</p>
<p>proprietor recently in this city, before the congressional committee
</p>
<p>itself, openly and boldly stated that such had been his advice and
</p>
<p>would continue to be his advice, and that he thought the murders
</p>
<p>would be committed. Threats of assassination of the Governor, of
</p>
<p>the returning officers and of the various leaders of the Republican
</p>
<p>party were made openly thoughoufc the summei', in the newspapers
</p>
<p>and on the streets, in the hotels and in all places of public resort.
</p>
<p>Finally the White League conspiracy culminated in the bloody insur-
</p>
<p>rection of September 14, which for a moment overpowered the State
</p>
<p>government, and which, next to the Coushatta massacre, had the
</p>
<p>most powerful influence throughout the whole State in intimidating
</p>
<p>and deterring negroes from voting. [Applause.]
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OF THE COLORED PEOPLE.
</p>
<p>There are in this meeting prominent colored citizens, members of
</p>
<p>the Legislature, and others from all portions of the State. There are
</p>
<p>also prominent colored gentlemen of the highest social and moral
</p>
<p>standing in this community; men educated in Paris and other capi-
</p>
<p>tals of Europe; men who have natural abilities and acquired accom-

</p>
<p>plishments; men of honor and high standing among their fyllow-
</p>
<p>citizens; men who are not excelled by the highest toned gentlemen
</p>
<p>whose names are on the White League rolls. I now appeal to this
</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Trade and these other indig-
</p>
<p>nant mercantile and theological bodies a question: Gentlemen, did
</p>
<p>you ever call one single meeting to denounce them in public or
</p>
<p>private? Were you afraid? [Terriffic applause.] Did your press
</p>
<p>denounce them, or did it not try to conceal or apologize for them ?
</p>
<p>Were they afraid? And did not a part of your press boldly justify
</p>
<p>them? France had one great massacre  St, Bartholomew  and
</p>
<p>ever since, for hundreds of years, the black cloud of its memory
</p>
<p>has darkened the fame of that nation. And her savants, her
</p>
<p>clergy, her business men, her statesmen have solemnly before the
</p>
<p>world, denounced the horrid crime. England had her massacre
</p>
<p>in the obscure Scotch valley of G-lencoe. One hundred persons
</p>
<p>were murdered. England, up to the day of Macaulay, two hundred
</p>
<p>years afterward, kept repenting for and denouncing the crime be-
</p>
<p>fore the civilized world. Macaulay has crystalized her repentance
</p>
<p>in the tearful and indignant confession and rebuke of his immortal
</p>
<p>history. Louisiana has had nine massacres in eight years, all of
</p>
<p>them as atrocious as St. Bartholomew; most of them bloodier and
</p>
<p>with more victims than Glencoe. Gentlemen, merchants and clergy
</p>
<p>of New Orleans, when did you ever call a meeting to denounce
</p>
<p>these horrid crimes? Are you afraid ? [Loud applause.]
</p>
<p>And yet you denounce Sheridan as being untrue in his statements.
</p>
<p>What is untrue ? That these atrocities were committed ? Tou dare
</p>
<p>not say that! That the men who committed them are
</p>
<p>BANDITTI ?
</p>
<p>You dare not say that! That you have kept silence and refused to
</p>
<p>condemn them in the same manner that you were so swift to con-
</p>
<p>demn Sheridan ? Tou dare not say that.
</p>
<p>THE WHITE LEAGUE CAMPAIGN OF 1874,
</p>
<p>The Democratic' and White League campaign of 1874 was a
</p>
<p>second edition of the White Camelia campaign of 1868. It opened
</p>
<p>by aa organized, systematic plan, commenced simultaneously
</p>
<p>throughout the State, for ejecting by violence from their positions
</p>
<p>the lawfully appointed or elected parish officials, and substituting
</p>
<p>in their places the so-called McEnery officials. The opening act of

</p>
<p>this novel political campaign, was the capture by a mob, of six men,
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>publican voters, not one vote was cast for Grant; in Union, out o^
</p>
<p>872 registered Eepublican voters, one vote was cast for Grant; in
</p>
<p>St. Martin, out of 933 registered Eepublican voters, 25 votes were
</p>
<p>cast for Grant; in St. Helena, out of 569 registered Republican
</p>
<p>voters, 136 votes cast for Grant; in Avoyelles, out of 2188 registered
</p>
<p>Republican voters, 520 votes were cast for Grant; in Catahoula, out
</p>
<p>of 992 registered Republican voters, 150 votes were cast for Grant;
</p>
<p>in Caldwell, out of 586 registered Republican voters, 28 votes were
</p>
<p>cast for Grant; while in those banner Democratic and White League
</p>
<p>parishes of De Soto with 1403 Republican voters; Jackson with 822
</p>
<p>Republican voters; Lafayette, with 897 Republican voters; Ver-
</p>
<p>milion, with 282 Republican voters, and Washington, with 168 Re-
</p>
<p>publican voters, not one solitary Republican vote for Grant was east
</p>
<p>in all those parishss. The net result of the Democratic and White
</p>
<p>Camelia campaign of 1868 was that out of 36,278 Republican votes
</p>
<p>in twenty-two parishes of the State, through the intimidation, fear
</p>
<p>and terrorism resulting from the massacres before enumerated, only
</p>
<p>1118 Republican votes were allowed to be deposited for General
</p>
<p>Grant.
</p>
<p>CAUSE OF THE ELECTION LAW AND RETURNING BOAED.
</p>
<p>Those facts were the origin and the cause of the peculiar election
</p>
<p>laws of this State, sometimes styled by our White League friends
</p>
<p>" infamous." They have, however, no word of similar reprobation
</p>
<p>for the massacres which made their enactment necessary. These
</p>
<p>massacres, in which riots were substituted for elections, are what
</p>
<p>made a Returning Board right and necessary. [Loud cheers.]
</p>
<p>ARE THE INDICiNANT MERCHANTS AND THEOLOGIANS APEAID ?
</p>
<p>These facts have been officially proven before a committee of the
</p>
<p>General Assembly and before two congressional committees. They
</p>
<p>are not denied. They have been notorious for years. Now, when
</p>
<p>General Sheridan characterizes the perpetrators of similar deeds of
</p>
<p>atrocity in 1874 as
</p>
<p>BANDITTI,
</p>
<p>the Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Trade, the Cotton

</p>
<p>Exchange, the City Council, the bodies of merchants and a
</p>
<p>part of the clergy assemble and pass indignant reso-
</p>
<p>lutions, denouncing his statements as untrue. Let me ask the
</p>
<p>The Bossier parish massacre in which over 300 negroes were
</p>
<p>killed and wouuded, the St. Landry massacre, in which 200 were
</p>
<p>killed and wounded; the Orleans massacres, in which sixty-three
</p>
<p>were killed and wounded; the Caddo massacre, in which forty-six
</p>
<p>were killed and wounded; the Jefferson massacre; in which forty-
</p>
<p>seven were killed and wounded; the St. Bernard massacre, in which
</p>
<p>sixty-eight were killed and wounded  all these occurred in the one
</p>
<p>year 1868.
</p>
<p>In 1873 the Colfax massacre, in which 100 were killed and woun-
</p>
<p>ded. In 1874 the Coushatta massacre, in which six white men were
</p>
<p>first captured by a mob and afterward taken out and shot in cold
</p>
<p>blood. Add to these an estimate given by members of the General
</p>
<p>Assembly from the different parishes of over 1000 persons since 1869
</p>
<p>who have been killed for political reasons, and you have the grand
</p>
<p>total, and by no means an accurate or full one, but such as I have
</p>
<p>been able to gather hastily together of 2190. You will observe that
</p>
<p>of these 724 were perpetrated in 1868, in the fall and summer pre-
</p>
<p>ceding the presidential election. To these 724, which belong to the
</p>
<p>particular massacres which I have just enumerated, must be added
</p>
<p>over 300 individual murders, which occurred in that same period,
</p>
<p>making somewhere over 1000 persons killed in 1868, and for pohtical
</p>
<p>reasons.
</p>
<p>THE EFFECT ON THE ELECTION.
</p>
<p>Now mark the result. The day of election in 1868 was as peace-
</p>
<p>able and quiet an election day as ever occurred in this country.
</p>
<p>Yet in the parish of Orleans where there were from 13,000 to 16,000

<p>audience, so constituted, to answer whether I tell the truth or HO
</p>
<p>when I charge and aver that in the last election in this State all the
</p>
<p>colored men who voted the Democratic ticket in this State, volun-
</p>
<p>tarily and through their own preference, and not from fear either of
</p>
<p>violence to their persons or lives or of being deprived of their daily
</p>
<p>bread, could be held in this room upon this platform where I am
</p>
<p>now standing. [Cries of "That is so." Applause.] I charge and
</p>
<p>aver that the same violence and intimidation which in 1868 abso-
</p>
<p>lutely barred through terror from the polls 38,000 Republican voters,
</p>
<p>who desired to vote for Grant, did at this election, in 1874, control
</p>
<p>ninety-nine out of every one hundred colored votes that were cast
</p>
<p>for the Democratic party, and did drive thousands away from the
</p>
<p>polls. [Applause, and cries of that's so.]
</p>
<p>THE WHITE LEAGUE CONSPIKACT.
</p>
<p>I come now to the special function of the White League conspiracy
</p>
<p>in controlling the late election. The White League organization is a
</p>
<p>semi-military, semi-political society. It is also a confederated or-
</p>
<p>ganization, being in sympathy, co-operation and correspondence
</p>
<p>with organizations of a similar character in the other reconstructed
</p>
<p>States of the South. Its objective point in all these States is the
</p>
<p>overthrow of the reconstructed governments as based upon negro
</p>
<p>suffrage. I aver and charge that as the results of the White League
</p>
<p>organization open and repeated threats of resistance to the United
</p>
<p>States arms were made throughout this city and State for weeks
</p>
<p>and months. I aver tiat the assassination of the Governor, of the
</p>
<p>returning officers and of other Republican officials were publicly
</p>
<p>and repeatedly made everywhere. I aver that on the fourteenth of
</p>
<p>September offers of aid of men and munitions were sent to the
</p>
<p>League here from other Southern States. I am told by a corre-
</p>
<p>spondent of one of the Western papers that cannon and munitions
</p>
<p>of war were sent by the League of this city to Vicksburg. I aver
</p>
<p>that at the Baton Rouge Convention, in speeches which were after-
</p>
<p>ward suppressed from the newspapers, both John McEnery and R.
</p>
<p>H. Marr counseled and threatened violence and revolutionary pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding against the State government. Robert Toombs, when in

</p>
<p>his speech last summer he threatened that United States troops on
</p>
<p>their way to New Orleans should be arrested in Georgia, only said
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>out openly what all were thinking secretly, and no other one was
</p>
<p>bold and candid enough to assert.
</p>
<p>Finally I aver and charge that the Colfax and Coushatta massa-
</p>
<p>cres, the fourteenth of September revolution and the White League
</p>
<p>conspiracy did for the political campaign of 1874 precisely what the
</p>
<p>six massacres of 1868 and the Knights of the White Camelia did
</p>
<p>for the political campaign of 1868; that is they by organized
</p>
<p>violence, bloodshed, force and intimidation suppressed and drove
</p>
<p>from the polls the Republican majority. [Applause, and cries of
</p>
<p>that's so.]
</p>
<p>THE REVOLUTIONARY ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE GOVERNMENT ON JANUARY 4.
</p>
<p>On the second of January the White League preparations for
</p>
<p>forcibly revolutionizing the State government were inaugurated by
</p>
<p>the violent and secret kidnapping and abduction af Mr. Cousin,
</p>
<p>member from St. Tammany. I aver and charge that in the then
</p>
<p>state of parties, there being fifty-three Democrats to fifty-three
</p>
<p>Republicans returned elected to the House, the abduction of Mr.
</p>
<p>Cousin was as completely revolutionary as if they had abducted all
</p>
<p>the Republican members. The abduction of one vote, which gave
</p>
<p>to them the control of the House, was as grave an offense and as
</p>
<p>much of a revolution as though the Republican majority had been
</p>
<p>twenty, and they had abducted twenty-one. I further charge that
</p>
<p>this abduction was a part of the conspiracy, on the part of the
</p>
<p>Demacrats and White Leaguers, and the first step in its carrying
</p>
<p>out. I charge that the murder of Fabius McKay Dunn was a crime
</p>
<p>committed by a mistake of the perpetrators who intended in his
</p>
<p>place to have murdered Raford Blunt, a Republican Senator. | Cries
</p>
<p>of " That is so." Applause.] I charge that the sudden appearance
</p>
<p>\on the street in front of the State House doors of a company of
</p>
<p>men, with badges as sergeant-at-arms suddenly displayed upon
</p>
<p>their coats, was another step in the conspiracy. I charge that there
</p>
<p>was, in the immediate vicinity of the State House, a company of
</p>
<p>White Leaguers prepared with scaling ladders for the purpose of
</p>
<p>forcibly entering the State House. The violent seizure by Mr. Wiltz

</p>
<p>of the Speaker's chair was another step in the conspiracy. I charge
</p>
<p>that the Senators known as the McEnry Senators, who claim to
</p>
<p>have been elected in 1872, were all present in the cit}' from their
</p>
<p>different parishes, and meeting with the Democratic and White
</p>
<p>Leag'ue Senators elected at the last election in preparation of a plan
</p>
<p>to revolutionize the State Senate. I charge that on the floor of the
</p>
<p>House of Representatives, during the revolutionary proceedings of
</p>
<p>the fourth, it was openly asserted by White Leaguers that the
</p>
<p>Kellogg government would be completely overthrown that day. I
</p>
<p>charge that when General De Trobriand entered the hall of the
</p>
<p>House there was no legally organized House in session; Mr. Wilt7,
</p>
<p>was not the Speaker of any House. The body there assembled was
</p>
<p>a revolutionary mob  nothing more. [Loud cheers and applause.]
</p>
<p>WHITE PEOPLE EEPUDIATE THEIR PLEDGES.
</p>
<p>Finally, I charge that in the White League Coushatta campaign
</p>
<p>of 1874, in its assassinations arid massacres, in the tone of its press,
</p>
<p>in its war upon negro children in the schools, in their proposition
</p>
<p>for restoring star cars, and in the thoroughly proscriptive, vindic-
</p>
<p>tive and revengeful spirit which they have reawakened in the people
</p>
<p>and heightened to a fury never known before, the white people of
</p>
<p>this State have more completely repudiated every principle they
</p>
<p>professed and every promise they made in 1872 than was ever done
</p>
<p>by any political party in the history of the world before. In 1872
</p>
<p>they had adopted Greele}^ and his platform of peace and concilia-
</p>
<p>tion and the recognition of the legitimate results of reconstruction.
</p>
<p>In their adoption of the Liberal platform they more expressly and
</p>
<p>specifically repledged themselves to these principles. In the
</p>
<p>speeches of all their orators, in the resolutions of all their meetings
</p>
<p>and in the professions of all their newspaper press they again and
</p>
<p>again iterated and reiterated these same principles. There is not a
</p>
<p>single one of these principles that they have not abandoned, re-
</p>
<p>pudiated, condemned and put under the ban of a terrible prescrip-
</p>
<p>tion by their course for the last eighteen months. [Loud applause].
</p>
<p>The massacre of 1866 led to reconstruction; the massacre of
</p>
<p>1868 led to the election laws, and the enforcement acts of Congress;
</p>
<p>the massacre of Colfax in 1873 sent a chill over the wave of sympa-
</p>
<p>thy, which was rising at the North for us, and in my opinion de-
</p>
<p>feated Mr. Carpenter's bill for a new election; and the massacre of
</p>
<p>Coushatta, and the White League campaign of 1874, with the riot

<p>of September fourteeenth, ending in the revolutionary attempt to
</p>
<p>overthrow the State government on January fourth, have undone
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>all that the Liberal and Conservative men of both parties sought to
</p>
<p>accomplish in 1872, and have brought the State to the brink of war
</p>
<p>and desolation. [Applause].
</p>
<p>WHY REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED THE FUSION OF 1872.
</p>
<p>My friends, I went with the Fusion party of 1812. I did it
</p>
<p>honestly. I did it without pay. They all can not say that. I did
</p>
<p>it without bargain or promise of reward. They all can not say
</p>
<p>that. I did it at much pecuniary and personal sacrifice. I did it to
</p>
<p>my own political destruction, for I was bitterly assailed by my former
</p>
<p>political friends, and, at the same time politically ostracised, ignored,
</p>
<p>and in every way thrown overboard by the people whom I was trying
</p>
<p>to assist. I did it, clearly and painfully foreseeing all these dis-
</p>
<p>agreeable consequences to myself; but I did it solely and exclusively
</p>
<p>for one reason. It was to avert this very conflict that is now upon
</p>
<p>us. I tried to commit, and did commit, publicly, solemnly, and, as
</p>
<p>I thought, beyond recall, the white people of this State to such an
</p>
<p>acknowledgement of the rights of the colored people, and of repub-
</p>
<p>lican principles, as would iorever prevent them from again drawing a
</p>
<p>color line; from again proscribing people for political opinions; from
</p>
<p>again trying to cany an election by fear and threats, by revolvers
</p>
<p>and knives, by leagues and conspiracies, by murder and massacre.
</p>
<p>I was content to abandon all hopes of political preference for myself,
</p>
<p>could I by this course have attained the end.
</p>
<p>I failed, failed more completely and swiftly than ever did any
</p>
<p>public man who trusted to the public professions of so large a num-
</p>
<p>bei of people. I failed not from any fault oi my position, but from
</p>
<p>the deliberate abandonment by the white people of this State of the
</p>
<p>position taken by them in 18T2, and their going back to the violent
</p>
<p>and bloody tactics of 1868. In this course they were encouraged
</p>
<p>and sustained by the Democracy of the country and by the hopes
</p>
<p>of a Democratic victory in 1816. In the returning sense of the
</p>
<p>country of the true situation here, and in the continued ascendancy
</p>
<p>of Republican principles, rests our only hope for salvation fi'om a
</p>
<p>reign of terror under the second Confederacy, equal in violence to

</p>
<p>that of the first Confederacy of 1860.
</p>
<p>For those sincere and liberal Conservative and Democratic gentle-
</p>
<p>men who acted with me in good faith in 1872, and who have extended
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>to nie so mauy acts of courtesy and kindness, I have no words but of
</p>
<p>friendliness, adding the hope that we may yet co-operate for the
</p>
<p>canse of good government in Louisiana. To those able and astute
</p>
<p>leaders and followers of the Democratic party who accepted the aid
</p>
<p>of myself and Republican friends with mental reservations, and who
</p>
<p>afterward repudiated their promises and made themselves merry at
</p>
<p>the expense of our credulity, I beg leave to return my thanks for
</p>
<p>the ingenious and useful lesson that they l)ave taught to Republi-
</p>
<p>cans, and I hope they will pardon me for comforting myself with
</p>
<p>the words of the quaint old Scotch rhyme:
</p>
<p>He digged a pit,
</p>
<p>He digged it deep,
</p>
<p>He digged it for Jiis brother;
</p>
<p>By his great sin
