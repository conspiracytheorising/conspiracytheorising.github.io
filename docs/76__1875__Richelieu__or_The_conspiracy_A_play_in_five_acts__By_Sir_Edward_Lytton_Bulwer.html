<p>THE N E W YORK DRAMA inaugurates a New Era in Dramatic Literature, and meets a long acknowledged want of the Reading Public. Its object is to
</p>
<p>place before the Whole Reading Community the choicest productions of the greatest
</p>
<p>writers ofthe world, from Shakespeare to the present time, with the Stage Business, Positions, etc., so clearly explained, as to render every scene and incident as plain to the reader as
</p>
<p>though he were actually present at the performance of the play.
</p>
<p>This series of Plays will be' selected with the greatest care, and no Play will be published
</p>
<p>that is not pure in its moral tone, and of high rank in literary merit. All New Plays of real
</p>
<p>sterling merit will be published as, early as circumstances will permit.
</p>
<p>- While the leading Play of each Number will be a Standard Piece, suitable for the Read-.
</p>
<p>ing Room or the Stage, the two "After Pieces" will be found also admirably adapted for
</p>
<p>~ PRIVATE THEATRICALS OR SCHOOL EXHIBITIONS.
</p>
<p>jIn order to place this invaluable work within the reach of all, we have determined to
</p>
<p>put the price at the exceedingly low figure of
</p>
<p>l:: Fifteen Cents per Number:!!
</p>
<p>(EACH NUMBER' CONT-AIININ THREE COMPLEtE P LAYS.)
</p>
<p>which, for a work of this class, Style of Printing, and quality of Paper, we believe to be
</p>
<p>unprecedented in the trade;-and we shall spare no trouble or expense to make this the

<p>THE END.
</p>
<p>AUTHOR'S REMARKS.
</p>
<p>The administration of Cardinal Richelieu, whom (despite all his darker qualities,) Voltaire and History justly consider the
</p>
<p>true architect -f the French monarchy, and the great parent of French civilization, is characterized by features alike tragic and
</p>
<p>comic. A weak king-an ambitious favorite; a despicable conspiracy against the minister, nearly always associated with a
</p>
<p>dangerous treason against the State-these, with little variety of names and tates, constitute the eventful cycle through which, with
</p>
<p>a dazzling ease and an arrogant confidence, the great luminary fulfilled its destinies. Blent together, in startling contrast, we see
</p>
<p>the grandest achievements and the pettiest agents - the spy - the mistress - the capuchin - the destruction of feudalism - the
</p>
<p>humiliation of Austria-the dismemberment of Spain.
</p>
<p>Richelieu himself is still what he was in his own day-a man of two characters. If, on the one hand, he is justly represented
</p>
<p>as inflexible and vindictive, crafty and unscrupulous, so, on the other, it cannot be denied that he was placed in times in whicl tilhe
</p>
<p>long impunity of every license required stern examples-that he was beset by perils and intrigues, which gave a certain excuse to ther
</p>
<p>subtlest inventions of self-defense-that his ambition was inseparably connected with a passionate love for the glory of his country-m
</p>
<p>and that, if he was her dictator, hle. was not less her benefactor. It has been fairly remarked by the most impartial historians, that
</p>
<p>he-was no less generous to merit than severe to crime-that, in the various departments of the State, the Army, and the Church, he
</p>
<p>selected and distinguished the ablest aspirants-that the wars which he conducted were, for the most pant, essential to the preservation
</p>
<p>of France, and Europe itself, from the formidable encroachments of the Austrian House-that, in spite of those wars, the people were
</p>
<p>not oppressed with exorbitant imposts-and that he left the kingdom he had governed in a more flourishing and vigorous state than
</p>
<p>at any former pelriod of the French history, or at the decease of Louis XIV.
</p>
<p>The cabals formed against the great statesman were not carried on by the patriotism of public virtue, nor the emulation oi
</p>
<p>equal talent; they were but court struggles, in wvhich the most worthless agents had recourse to the most desperate means. In each,
</p>
<p>as I have before observed, we see comined the twofold attempt to murder the minister, and to betray the country. Such, then, are
</p>
<p>the agents, and such the designs, with wvhich truth, in the Drama, as in History, requires us to contrast the celebrated Cardinal; not
</p>
<p>disguising his foibles or his vices, but not unjust to the grander qualities (Lspecially the lovre of country), by which they mwere often
</p>
<p>dignified, and at times redeemed.
</p>
<p>The historical drama is the concentration of historical events. In the attempt to place upon the stage the picture of an era,
</p>
<p>that license with dates and details, which poetry permits and which the highest authorities in the Drama of France herself have
</p>
<p>sanctioned, has been, though not unsparingly, indulged. The conspiracy of the Duc de Bouillon is, for instance, amalgamated with
</p>
<p>the denouncement of the Day,f LDupes; and circumstances connected with the treason of Cinq-Mars (whose brilliant youth and
</p>
<p>gloomy catastrophe tend to subvert noetic and historic justice, by seducing us to forget his base ingratitude and his perfidious
</p>
<p>apostacy!, are identified with the fate of the earlier favorite Baradas,.whose sudden rise and as sudden fall passed inito a proverb.
</p>
<p>I ought to add, that the noble romance of Cinq-Mars suggested one of the scenes in the fifth act; and that for the conception of some

<p>DECAY OF THE TEETH.
</p>
<p>The causes of the decay of the teeth are two-acids, and a
</p>
<p>minute fungus abundantly founld in the mouth and called lepthorix
</p>
<p>buccalis. All"acids, both vegetable and mineral, act promptly on the
</p>
<p>teeth, by dissolving the enamel, and by softening the dentine. Sour
</p>
<p>fruits and vinegar salads are likely to injure the teeth, unless the mouth
</p>
<p>is carefully washed out after eating them. The -little parasite fungus
</p>
<p>can only be removed by alkaline mixtures, and a dentifrice containing a
</p>
<p>proper proportion of soap is the best to use. It appears that parasites
</p>
<p>grow and multiply very rapidly, and especially between the teeth, and
</p>
<p>for this reason a liquid tooth wash is preferable to powders -or pastes, as
</p>
<p>it cleans the interstices between the teeth, and dislodges any accumulations injurious to the teeth or gums. A preparation containing such
</p>
<p>quantities of saponaceous matter (the great essential of tooth washes) as
</p>
<p>will readily destroy the little parasite fungus, and neutralize the effect
</p>
<p>of acids, thus protecting the teeth from decay and keeping the gums
</p>
<p>healthy, is found in that well known dentifrice, SOZODONT. Combining as it does, elegance as a toilet article with excellence as a dentifrice,
</p>
<p>uniting pleasure with power, whitening the teeth and sweetening the
</p>
<p>breath, it is no wonder that SOZODONT is held in such high estimation
</p>
<p>by ladies and gentlemen of the lyric and dramatic profession, and particularly by those whose popularity depends on their loveliness and attractions, for handsome teeth call forth many expressions of admiration.
</p>
<p>Among society ladies, the belles of private life, SOZODONT is equally
</p>
<p>in demand, while eminent physicians, dentists, and scientific men, are
</p>
<p>loud in its praises. If you have not used it, a single trial will convince
