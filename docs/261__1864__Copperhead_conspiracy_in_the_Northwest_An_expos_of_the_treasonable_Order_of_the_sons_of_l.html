</p>
<p>In 1863 this order existed in the State of lud .ana, under the
</p>
<p>name of " Knights of the Goklen Circle," and became subject to
</p>
<p>judicial investigation, as is shown in th6 following statement of
</p>
<p>the Clerk of the United States Disti'ict Court for that State :
</p>
<p>T, Watt J. Smith, Clerk of the United States District Court for the Dis-
</p>
<p>trict of Indiana, do hereby certify that the records of said Court establish
</p>
<p>the following facts :
</p>
<p>On the eleventh of February, 1863, the follo'.ving persons of iMoi-gan
</p>
<p>County were indicted for conspiracy to resist by force of arms the arrest of
</p>
<p>deserters, namely :
</p>
<p>Samuel Dillmau, William Dillman, Jacob Groscclose, Andrew J. Perry,
</p>
<p>John Coldwill, Madi?on Flake, Mitchel Porry, were tried at the March term,
</p>
<p>18G3, by jury, convicted, and ea,ch fined five hundred dollars. The proof
</p>
<p>established the feet that the defendants were members of a secret, oath-
</p>
<p>bound organization, then known as the Knights of the Golden Circle ; that
</p>
<p>they tired upon United States soldiers who had in charge two deserters
</p>
<p>who were members of the same order.
</p>
<p>Co the seventh of July, 1863, the following persons of Boone County
</p>
<p>wore indicted for obstructing the di'aft, namely : Patrick Lee, Patrick White,
</p>
<p>Jeremiah Nichols, John Nichols, Jacob Hill. Jeremiah Gleeson, John Dog-
</p>
<p>lass, EH Goodwin, Conrad Hill, Nathan Curtis, James M. Lucus, Wright

</p>
<p>July eleventh, 18G3, the following persons of Putnam County were
</p>
<p>mdicted for conspiracy, to oppose the draft, namely : William llandel), John
</p>
<p>Ford, George Ford, Isaac Ford, Alexander Siddons, William Hornmill,
</p>
<p>Printed by the Union Conc/ressional Committee.

</p>
<p>George Hanks, George N. Coffman. These men alleged that they were a
</p>
<p>committee appointed at a meeting to wait upon the enrolling commissioner
</p>
<p>and demand that he proceed no further. The District Attorney dismissed
</p>
<p>the charge of conspiracy, and a verdict of guilty was returned on the charge
</p>
<p>of obstructing the draft, and each were fined.
</p>
<p>Also the following persons, of the same county were indicted on same
</p>
<p>chaige : Joseph Ellis, William Ellis, Isaac Day, William McNary, Francis
</p>
<p>Allen, Conrad Cook. Joseph Ellis was tried on the charge of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>found guilty, and fined five hundred dollars. Verdicts of guilty were ren-
</p>
<p>dered against the others on charge of obstructing the draft. The proof
</p>
<p>clearly established the fact that between seventy-five and one hundred
</p>
<p>armed men (many of them blackened their faces) went to the house of the
</p>
<p>Enrolling Commissioner about midnight and demanded his enrollment
</p>
<p>papers, and obtained and destroyed them.
</p>
<p>The following persons of Monroe County were indicted for obstructing the
</p>
<p>draft: Elmore J. Walker, Joel Morgan, John Graves, John Morgan, Sen.,
</p>
<p>Richard J. Walker, Elijah Conder, Henry Crumb, Washington Sares, John
</p>

</p>
<p>There have been " great pisyjy other convictions and pleas of guilty of
</p>
<p>porsons residing in irious parts of the State on charges of obstructing the
</p>
<p>Draft.
</p>
<p>The p^oof, in imost every instance, connected the defendants with a
</p>
<p>secret organizat' n whose objects were shown on the trials to be opposition
</p>
<p>to the executio.i of the laws of the United States, to the prosecution of the
</p>
<p>war, and friendly to the cause of the rebeUion.
</p>
<p>The records of the Court further show that three witnesses who were
</p>
<p>taken before the Grand Jury and refusing to testify, a presentment of the
</p>
<p>facts in each case was made to the Court signed by the foreman of the
</p>
<p>Jury. In answer to a rule entered against each to show cause why they

<p>did not answer the questions propounded to them by the Grand Jury, they
</p>
<p>and each of them testified before the Court that they could not answer the
</p>
<p>questions proposed without criminating themselves and rendering them-
</p>
<p>selves liable to a criminal prosecution for a violation of the laws of the
</p>
<p>United States, that they were members of this secret order, and could not
</p>
<p>disclose its objects and purposes for the above reasons, and were shielded
</p>
<p>by the Court on the ground that they could not be required to criminate
</p>
<p>themselves.
</p>
<p>* The existence of a wide-spread secret order whose purposes are disloyal,
</p>
<p>and at war with the peaceful execution of the law, has been established
</p>
<p>beyond all question by the trials and convictions in this Court, as conclu-
</p>
<p>sively shown by the records.
</p>
<p>In witness of the truth of which, I, as Clerk of the said Court, have here-
</p>
<p>unto set my hand and the seal of the said Court, at Indianapolis, this
</p>
<p>twelfth day of September, a.d. 1864. Watt J. Smith, Clerk.
</p>
<p>It became the duty of General Carrington, the Commander of
</p>
<p>the District of Indiana, to find out the doings of this treasonable
</p>
<p>association ; and, for that purpose, resort was had to the detective
</p>
<p>Kystem, so eifectual in the discovery of crime. The result of his
</p>
<p>investigation is given in the following report made by him to

<p>partial outline of the nature, work, and extent of a disloyal society or order

<p>I. NATUIIE OP THE OKDEU.
</p>
<p>1st. It is both civil and military. In its first relation, it declares prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of ethics and politics, for adoption and dissemination, that are hostile
</p>
<p>to the Government of the United States. In the latter relation, it assumes
</p>
<p>to organize armies for " actual service " in support of those principles, treat-
</p>
<p>ing the United States Government as their e>ic?ni/, and that of the rebellion
</p>
<p>as their friend.
</p>
<p>2d. It is secret and oath-hound.
</p>
<p>8d. It is despotic and absolute. The penalties of disobedience to its offi-
</p>
<p>cers are unlimited, including the death-penalty itself.

</p>
<p>' E.\-hil)it C. Constitution of the County Parent Temples, subordinate to
</p>
<p>Mdiich Branch County Temples may be organized.
</p>
<p>This order, during 1863, was variously named, but popularly known as
</p>
<p>" K. G. C," KsiGHTS OF THE GoLDEN CiHCLE, with whose ritual, oaths, etc.,
</p>
<p>I furnished j'-ou in the spring of 1863. The penalty of disclosure was then
</p>
<p>death, and this penalty was specified in their obligations.
</p>
<p>During the fall of 1863, the order changed name and ritual, and became
</p>
<p>the " O. A. K.," Order of American Knights ; the ritual, signs, pass-
</p>
<p>words, etc., of which are in my possession.
</p>
<p>At the meeting of this Order, February 16th and 17th, 18G4, the Grand
</p>
<p>Commander for the State of Indiana communicated the purposes of the
</p>
<p>Order, as well as the views of C. L. Vallandigham, claimed by the Order as
</p>
<p>its Head and Supreme Commander.

<p>These consist of the " V.," Vestibule of the Temple, and first, second

<p>and third Temple Degi'ees or Conclaves.
</p>
<p>The organization of the "Society of the Illini," or Democratic Clubs,
</p>
<p>does not involve full member.ship in the Order; for thus for comparatively
</p>
<p>few in each Temple are advanced to the Chapters or Councils of the higher
</p>
<p>degrees, but the lower and subordinate bodie.s, and that of the " Illini," is
</p>
<p>educational and probationary, looking to full acceptance of the general prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the order, before the advancement of the "Neophyte," to the
</p>
<p>higher degrees.
</p>
<p>As aijpcars from the official report of February 17th, there were, then,
</p>
<p>only twelve thousand members in tliis State, and a recent report from a
</p>
<p>portion of the State would hardly triple this number, that is, of initiates,

</p>
<p>The unwritten work and lectures of this Order vary in different States
</p>
<p>and counties, and in Temples of the same county, though not in essentials.
</p>
<p>This is accounted for from the fact that organizing agents, in installing
</p>
<p>ofDccrs, could not take time to fully post and instruct tiicm, and the work
</p>
<p>was im])crfcctly committed to memory.
</p>
<p>While the penalties of disclosure are formally declared to be such as the
</p>
<p>officers of tbis Order shall direct, these penalties are specifically given in
</p>
<p>the verbal lectures and instructions. The oaths of 1863 specifically affixed
</p>
<p>the death-penalty. The same is enjoined in the present Order. Instruc-
</p>
<p>lioi^ to exciite this penalty upon at least one supposed informer have been
</p>
<p>isst"d within the last two months. Injunctions to arm, and much of the
</p>
<p> letail of subordinate military features of tlie Order are also given in verbal
</p>
<p>lectures. Concurrent testimony from diliercnt sources confirms the above.
</p>
<p>Many of the documents you have already seen, and they are not necessary
</p>
<p>in this report.
</p>
<p>lY. OPERATION'S OF THE ORDER.
</p>
<p>A few facts, derived from many concurrent sources, give significance to
</p>
<p>passages in tlie Constitutions and Rituals. Of some you were advised at
</p>
<p>the time  thus : 
</p>
<p>1st. The outbrealvS in Eastern Illinois were mainly checked by leaders of
</p>
<p>this Order, on the ground that. such outbreaks were preniatiu'e. This in-
</p>
<p>formation comes from Canada, Michigan, Illinois, and other quarters.
</p>
<p>2d. A lews da3-s before the attack of Forrest upon Paducah, I was in-
</p>
<p>formed that the Temples of the 0. A. K. in Northwestern Illinois expected
</p>
<p>such an attack, and that Forrest would cross into Illinois, and raise the
</p>
<p>standai-d of revolt. He came to Paducah, but was repulsed.
</p>
<p>3d. On the day that Morgan flrst entered Pound Gap, I was informed at
</p>
<p>Indianapolis, in the morning, that Morgan was about to enter Kentuck}"^, of
</p>
<p>which you were at once advised. At three p.m. you showed me a telegram
</p>
<p>from General Burbridge, that Morgan was in the Gap. This information,
</p>
<p>derived from yon, was communicatedio the secret Order with my permis-
</p>
<p>.sion. Upon this, two members of the Order, both prominent  one Colonel
</p>
<p>iriety. and the other Jud:;e J. F. Ibillitt
</p>
<p>ted tu have
</p>
<p>ped. The incuTcnts'
</p>
<p>, --.J . i _...iJsay from' Kentucky j-ou are ftimilitir wTT
</p>
<p>circumstances under which Morgan threw part of his force into Kentucky,
</p>
<p>wlien General Burbridge moved toward Virginia.
</p>
<p>4th. Information was given you of the visit of Vallanuigham to Detroit,
</p>
<p>hi-i projected trip to Chicago, of the meeting of the Grand Council of Indi-
</p>
<p>ana, June 13, of the proposed adjournment and meeting at Hamilton, June
</p>
<p>15, and that Vallandigham's immediate recall was subject of debate, and
</p>
<p>the prospect of his being at that time at Hamilton. At least one rebel offi-
</p>
<p>cer left Windsor, C. W., and visited Hamilton four weeks before, in the
</p>
<p>conlidence of dislo3'al persons, of which I was advised at that time by
</p>
<p>telegraph through General Noble. ,
</p>
<p>5th. Five days before Morgan attacked Mount Sterling, and the L. and L.
</p>
<p>R. R. was severed, written report was sent by disloyal persons, of which
</p>
<p>I have the originals, that the road was quiet, that "no mules" (U. S.
</p>
<p>soldiers) were on the line, and that a glorious work would begin the

<p>coming week.
</p>
<p>Cth. A courier intercepted between Frankfort and Louisville, who reported
</p>
<p>t me at Louisville, as I was starting for Indianapolis, claimed that Forrest
</p>
<p>was moving upon Southwesterti Kentuck}'', and that a portion of Buckner's
</p>
<p>command would join the fragments of Morgan in Western Virginia. Two
</p>
<p>days after, Forrest defeated Sturgis ; Buckner, however, was west of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi. I give these among many facts to show that there is a close
</p>
<p>correspondence of design and feeling betw'een traitors North and the rebels
</p>
<p>South. The whole plot of the Order herein referred to is in harmony
</p>
<p>with forcible interruption of the war.
</p>
<p>W. A. Bowles, before referred to, has made no close secret of his disloyal
</p>
<p>purposes, and his sympathy with the South.
</p>
<p>lie is reported as one of the four Major-Generals of the Order in Indiana.
</p>
<p>The remaining three are L. P. Jlilli^n, of Huntington, M.-yor AVall#er, of
</p>
<p>northwestern part of Indiana, vice Yeagle removed, and Andrew Hum-
</p>
<p>phreys, of Green county. The Grand Conunander has already been named.
</p>
<p>Although the new work, S. L., was obtained at Indianapolis, by R. , Bar-
</p>
<p>rett, for Missouri, it is understood that the Order is so far organized in that
</p>
<p>State as to run a risk of disappointment by a change, and that the work of
</p>
<p>the 0. A. K. will retain its usage, as it differs onl}' in non-essentials.
</p>
<p>Among the persons reported as at tlie conference with Judge Bullitt and
</p>
<p>Barrett, were J. J. Bingham, Dr. Antlion, and Mr. Ristine, of Indianapolis.
</p>
<p>I will also give the names of a few other members for your information, to
</p>
<p>enable you to watch the movement of this Order in Indiana, namely, Dr. Gat-
</p>
<p>ling, (associated with the Catling Gun,) Mr. Evert, of Vanderburgh, Mr. L.
</p>
<p>Leach, Mr. Otey, Myers of Laporte, Dr. Lemons, A. D. Raga, Mr. McBride,
</p>
<p>of Evansville, John G. Davis, and Lassell, of Cass county. Several of the
</p>
<p>above are delegates to the State Grand Council of Missouri ; and besides,
</p>
<p>n. 11. Dodd, to the Supreme Grand Council, to be held at Chicago, the first
</p>
<p>of July next, preparatory to the political convention of July 4.
</p>
<p>V. PURPOSES OF THE ORDER.
</p>
<p>It seems that the main pui-pose is political power, by union with the
</p>
<p>South, regardless of men or measures. The Eastern and Western Council
</p>
<p>leaders differ as to means to this end ; and, again, the radicals and conserv-
</p>
<p>atives differ, at the West.
</p>
<p>Men like Dr. W. A. Bowles seem indifferent to any presidential canvass,
</p>
<p>and to prefer an early armed rupture and positive union of the Northwest
</p>
<p>with the South. . _
</p>
<p>Such men vxz ^ItTJay 'alii ?.Ti^ious ior such an avmei \?.y^'?,\on as will give
</p>
<p>* utiii a nucleus for open deflancOjOf the United States. This is not specu-
</p>
<p>lation ; but proof is ample. IJutJ^ adverffeff'td ^me f:\ctsalreadjJl^nd*Vrill

<p>advise you, as I have the Government and General Heintzelman, as events
</p>
<p>progress.
</p>
<p>Very respectfully yours,
</p>
<p>Henry B. Carkington,
</p>
<p>Brigadier-General, Com'd'g Dist. Indiana.
</p>
<p>His Excellency Gov. 0. P. Mortox,
</p>
<p>Indianapolis, Indiana.
</p>
<p>Two months after the above report was made, Governor Mor-
</p>
<p>ton Avas advised that a number of arras and a quantity of fixed
</p>
<p>ammunition had been shipped from New-York to the head of the
</p>
<p>Order at Indianapolis. Notice of the fact was given to the public
</p>
<p>authorities. Mj. Russell, the Deputy Marslial for the city of

<p>Indianapolis, discloses, in the following affidavit, what afterwards

<p>took place in relation to the matter :

<p>State of Indiana,)
</p>
<p>Marion County. \ ^^'
</p>
<p>Before me, James N. Swcetser, a Notary Public within and for the county
</p>
<p>of Marion, State of Indiana, personally appeared John S. Russell, who,
</p>
<p>being first duly sworn, upon his oath, says he is now, and has been for
</p>
<p>more than two years last past, the Deputy Marshal of the city of Indian-
</p>
<p>apolis, State of Indiana ; and further saj^s, that on the twentieth day of
</p>
<p>August, A.D, 1864, he was sent for by 0. P. Morton, Governor of the
</p>
<p>State of Indiana, and was informed that there was a lot of arms and am-
</p>
<p>munition on the road to Indianapolis addressed to the care of J. J. Parsons,
</p>
<p>whose place of business is in tlie building occupied by H. II. Dodd, and
</p>
<p>known as the l^entinel Office ; that upon tlie request of the Governor, he
</p>
<p>Iirocoeded to search, and went to two railroad depots and the office of the
</p>
<p>Merchants' Despatch, and learned that on the fifth day of August, ten boxes,
</p>
<p>marked Hardware by Merchants' Despatch, addressed to Parsons, had al-
</p>
<p>ready been taken away from the Bellefontaine Depot, and chai'ges paid ;
</p>
<p>the gross weight was two thousand four hundred and five pounds ; they
</p>
<p>were receipted for on August the twelfth ; on further investigation he
</p>
<p>learned that twentj^-two boxes, addressed to the same party, weighing four
</p>
<p>thousand two hundred and sixty pounds, marked Hardware, were then in
</p>
<p>the Eellefont;iine Depot, which fact was immediately reported to the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, and'tlie Governor reported to Col. Warner, commanding the Veteran
</p>
<p>Reserve Corps at this place, who thereupon detailed one company to go
</p>
<p>with said Russell and seize said boxes ; in pursuance of which the boxes
</p>
<p>were taken by Russell and said company from the building in which said
</p>
<p>II. 11. Dodd & Co. and Parsons were doing business. We proceeded first
</p>
<p>to the Bellefontaine Depot, but the boxes were gone; but on finding the
</p>
<p>drayman, whose name is Henry Ankenbrook, he stated that the boxes
</p>
<p>were delivered at the house above mentioned. We found the twenty-two
</p>
<p>boxes in the press-room ; four more in the same room, supposed to be of
</p>
<p>the first lot, in one corner of the room, covered up with old tables and
</p>
<p>boards ; and six boxes were found in the second story, piled up behind a
</p>
<p>lot of other boxes filled with waste-paper and books thrown over them,
</p>
<p>and Parsons name scratched off the boxes. There were three hundred and
</p>
<p>jiinety nvolvt-rs and one hundred and forty thousand rounds fixed ammu-

<p>The above shipment was made as "Stationery," as shown on
</p>
<p>the bill of lading, in order to conceal the true contents ol the
</p>
<p>boxes
</p>
<p>Twenty-two additional boxes of arras, addressed to the same
</p>
<p>person, were subsequently seized in New-York. . ^ v^ .
</p>
<p>These arms were to have been used by the oath-bound traitoiB
</p>
<p>for the purpose of driving Union men from the polls at the
</p>
<p>approaching election in Indiana. How far similar desperate ar-
</p>
<p>rangement^ have been made to control the election in other
</p>
<p>States, is yet unknown. . ^ , .

<p>of the Order, an out-spoken traitor, boldly announced that the
</p>
<p>"Sons of Liberty" were in session in the city, and might have a
</p>
<p>communication to present to the Convention before its adjourn-
</p>
<p>"" Vallandingham wrote the platform, which was adopted almost
</p>
<p>unammouslyT and it was upon his motion that McClellan was
</p>
<p>declared the nominee of the Convention. T^e essential portions
</p>
<p>of the platform had been previously adopted by the Grand Coun-
</p>
<p>cil of the Order at a meeting held at Indianapolis on the sixteenth
</p>
<p>of February, 1864, as is shown by the followmg resolution found
</p>
<p>on the secrei recoi'ds of that Order, in the safe of Dodd, the Grand
</p>
<p>Commander for Indiana :
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>5 That whatever the theory of the powers of the Federal Government
</p>
<p>to coerce a State to remain in the Union may be, war as a means of restor-
</p>
<p>ing the Union is a delusion, involving a fearfnl wa^ste of hmnan life hope-
</p>
<p>less bankruptcy, and the speedy downfall of the Republic. Therefore we
</p>
<p>recommend a cessation of liostilities upon existing facts, and a convention
</p>
<p>of the sotereiqn States to adjust the terms of a peace with a mere to the
</p>
<p>restoration of the Union, entire if possible ; if not, so much and such
</p>
<p>parts as the affinities of interest and civilization may attract.
</p>
<p>Now read tlie following corresponding portion of the Chicago
</p>
<p>Platform :
</p>
<p>Besohed, That this Convention does explicitly declare, as the sense of
</p>
<p>thf American people, that after four years of failure to restore the Umon
</p>

</p>
<p>necessit'^ or war power higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself

<p>nity  tliey each emanated from the brain of Vallandingham, the
</p>
<p>Grand Commander of tlie secret and oath-bound conspirators.
</p>
<p>Sliould the nominee of this secret Order be elected to the Presi-
</p>
<p>dency, his administration will be controlled by the men who
</p>
<p>controlled the Convention, as a conseqiience certain to follo-w.
</p>
<p>They will demand, in the language of the platform of their Order,
</p>
<p>" a cessation of hostilities u^^on existing facts, and a convention of
</p>
<p>all the sovereign States to adjust the terms of peace, with a view

<p>to the restoration of the Union, entire if possible ; if not^ so much

<p>catching votes. That is well understood, or else the oath-boxmd
</p>
<p>traitors would not now be making every possible effort to attain
</p>
<p>power through his election.
</p>
<p>Are the people willing that such a result, so revolting to every
</p>
<p>feeling of manliood and patriotism, shall thus be accomplished ?
</p>
<p>Every, })atiiot is against it. Every soldier in the field is against
</p>
<p>it. . Tlie blood of the thousands slain by rebel hands cries from
</p>
<p>tlie ground against it, and, we fervently believe, the Great Ruler
</p>
<p>of the Universe is aojaiust it.
